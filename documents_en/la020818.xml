<HD>Mothers Escape From Baby Sellers</HD>
<DH>Asia: Poor pregnant women from Indonesia are targets of
traders in Malaysia. Authorities are cracking down on the practice.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LELY T. DJUHARI</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS WRITER</BD>
<DL>JAKARTA, Indonesia</DL>
<LD>Penniless, unmarried and far from home, Rubina thought that she had
found a safe place to have her baby after being fired as a housemaid
in Malaysia.</LD>
<LD>   Instead, the 20-year-old Indonesian migrant worker had stumbled
into the arms of baby traders--an illegal practice that authorities
say is increasing in Malaysia and targets poor Indonesians.</LD>
<LD>   "I had nowhere to turn. My boss told me to leave when my stomach
started showing," Rubina said recently.</LD>
<TE>   The man who recruited her as a maid told her that an "agent" would
give her shelter.</TE>
<TE>   "I was stuck in a house with six other pregnant women. Then the
agent started to offer me money for my unborn baby," Rubina said. If
she refused, the agent threatened to take her baby, she said.</TE>
<TE>   But Rubina, who like many Indonesians uses only one name, escaped,
as have many other Indonesian women, from baby-selling syndicates in
Malaysia's Kuching province.</TE>
<TE>   No exact figures are available. But as many as 30 pregnant women
were kept at a single apartment in Kuching recently, authorities
said.</TE>
<TE>   Rubina managed to get away because she was giving birth in a
hospital when Malaysian police raided the gang's house last month.</TE>
<TE>   She and 13 other Indonesian migrant female workers sought help at
the Indonesian consulate in Kuching, which helped them return to
Indonesia.</TE>
<TE>   She spoke to a reporter by phone from a shelter run by the Legal
Aid Foundation for Women in central Indonesia.</TE>
<TE>   "When they gave birth, they just threw them out on the streets,"
said Hairiah, head of the foundation.</TE>
<TE>   Poor Indonesian women come searching for jobs, said Maj. Suhadi, a
police spokesman in Pontianak, the provincial capital in West
Kalimantan, which borders Kuching province on Borneo.</TE>
<TE>   Often, they end up working as day laborers or housemaids. Because
they often lack work permits, they're reluctant to go to authorities
for help. If they become pregnant and are single, they are easy
targets for baby-selling syndicates, authorities said.</TE>
<TE>   Malaysian police hosted a recent meeting with their Indonesian
counterparts to discuss baby-trafficking.</TE>
<TE>   Malaysian traders--working with Indonesian accomplices--lure
pregnant women from their jobs, Hairiah said. The babies then are
either forcibly taken or purchased for sums ranging from $1,200 to
$4,800, depending on appearance and health, she said.</TE>
<TE>   The buyers are often childless Malaysian couples who use the black
market because it is easier and quicker than formal adoption, Hairiah
said.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the women never see their newborns again.</TE>
<TE>   But 21-year-old Evi was lucky. She got her son back.</TE>
<TE>   When she gave birth, baby agents took him without paying her, she
said. Five days later, she was told that she could have her son back
because his eyes were not slanted enough and his skin not white
enough for the tastes of his prospective parents.</TE>
<TE>   "They said he was ugly," Evi said.</TE>
<TE>   Evi now works at the Legal Aid Foundation in West Kalimantan
helping women like herself.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm just happy my baby is safe," she said.</TE>

<HD>Coffee Bar Is India's Surprising New Gathering Place</HD>
<DH>Beverage: Producers have faced a slump in exports by
selling Indians on the drink.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NIRMALA GEORGE</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS WRITER</BD>
<DL>NEW DELHI, India</DL>
<LD>Coffee machines hiss and splutter, spouting foamy cappuccinos and
lattes in a hubbub of 40 customers crammed into a small,
air-conditioned cafe.</LD>
<LD>   This is tea-drinking India, but the hot new gathering place is the
coffee bar.</LD>
<LD>   With a guitar leaning against the wall and a music system belting
out Grammy-winning hits, this outpost of Barista, India's foremost
coffee bar chain, is drawing throngs of high school and college
students, bored homemakers and pinstriped businessmen.</LD>
<TE>   "Delhi badly needed a place where people could meet informally,
without having to spend a packet [a lot]," said Vasundhara Chauhan, a
food writer.</TE>
<TE>   For Delhi's trendy young set, the fad is partly the result of
watching Hollywood movies showing ubiquitous Starbucks shops.</TE>
<TE>   "The ambience is welcoming. You don't have to run up a bill of
hundreds to hang out," said Deepa Kumar, a graduate student at Delhi
University.</TE>
<TE>   And, in India's conservative society, there are few places where
young people of both sexes can mingle without being frowned upon by
family. Coffee bars are fast filling that niche.</TE>
<TE>   Kumar, who comes from an observant Hindu family, said her parents
consider Barista a safe place to spend time with friends.</TE>
<TE>   "My mother goes to the Barista near our home. If it were sleazy,
she'd throw a fit," said Kumar, clad in jeans and a midriff-revealing
T-shirt while balancing two frothy concoctions of coffee and ice
cream.</TE>
<TE>   India is a big grower of coffee beans, producing 4% of the world's
supply. But it exports nearly 80% of its crop, and the industry has
suffered from a global slump in prices. Salvation may come by selling
coffee to Indians, who have favored tea for centuries.</TE>
<TE>   "The coffee industry in India has never focused on the domestic
market," said Barista's managing director, Ravi Deol. "Imagine if
even 10% of Indians were to switch to coffee. That's more than 100
million coffee drinkers."</TE>
<TE>   At Barista, a typical cup of coffee costs about 40 rupees, or 80
cents. With the minimum wage around 80 rupees a day, that's too
pricey for most of India's 1 billion people. Tea shops charge as
little as 5 rupees for a cup of coffee and 2 rupees for a cup of tea.</TE>
<TE>   Coffee chains use freshly ground Arabica or Jamaican beans, or
those grown on the gentle slopes of the Nilgiri Range in India's
southwest.</TE>
<TE>   Barista opened its first coffee shop in New Delhi in February
2000; it now has 85 outlets in 14 cities. The company is brewing
plans for 250 shops this year, Deol said.</TE>

<HD>Violence Lands on the Doorsteps of Kashmiris</HD>
<DH>South Asia: Civilians' homes are damaged or destroyed as
Islamic separatists fight Indian soldiers in the disputed Himalayan
territory.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MUJTABA ALI AHMAD</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS WRITER</BD>
<DL>BARAMULLA, India</DL>
<LD>Sixty-seven-year-old Taja Begum saw the trouble brewing. For days,
she noticed strangers wandering around outside her home.</LD>
<LD>   Still, she didn't expect her newly built house to become a
battleground between government soldiers and Muslim guerrillas.</LD>
<LD>   Begum and her family survived, but their home in the village of
Khwajabagh was destroyed by mortar fire from the government forces.
All that's left is twisted steel and concrete rubble.</LD>
<TE>   "We are destitute. We can't salvage anything from that heap," said
Begum's husband, Haji Habibullah Banday. "At my age, one savors the
fruits of labor of youth. I am too old to build a house again."</TE>
<TE>   The family now lives with kin.</TE>
<TE>   What happened in the family's village 37 miles northwest of
Srinagar, summer capital of the Indian-held portion of Kashmir, is
routine in the disputed Himalayan territory.</TE>
<TE>   Islamic separatists move into an area -- sometimes hiding in or
taking over homes for protection -- and Indian police or soldiers try
to drive the militants out.</TE>
<TE>   Gun battles between the two sides have destroyed more than 3,800
homes since the insurgency began in 1989, says the All Party Hurriyat
Conference, an association of Kashmiri political and religious
groups.</TE>
<TE>   On March 4, Begum's husband, a 71-year-old retired school
headmaster, had just stepped out of the house to buy bread at a
bakery. Their two sons, both government workers, had left for their
offices.</TE>
<TE>   A militant barged into their home.</TE>
<TE>   "There was one man with whom I pleaded to leave our house, but he
wouldn't listen," Begum recalled, with tears in her eyes.</TE>
<TE>   "The gun battle started and I, with two daughters-in-law and one
granddaughter, crouched in the corridor to save ourselves."</TE>
<TE>   Security forces say they attack homes only in extreme situations.</TE>
<TE>   "We coax and cajole the militants to surrender so that the
civilian life and property is not put in danger," said Mohammed Amin
Shah, a deputy inspector general of police. "When that fails, we take
effective action."</TE>
<TE>   Some civilians disagree that police avoid destruction, and some
say police even use innocent people as human shields.</TE>
<TE>   Baha-ud-din Hakeem, a neighbor who watched Begum's house
destroyed, says his son was forced by police to enter the ruin to
look for land mines and dead militants after the operation.</TE>
<TE>   "How can one justify destruction of property and jeopardize
innocent lives just to catch one militant?" he asked. "My son, Fayyaz
Ahmad, was used by security forces. It is the wrath of man against
man."</TE>
<TE>   Homeowners often are denied any redress for property lost in
battles. A new anti-terrorism law bars compensation or insurance
claims if an owner helps militants, and victims say it's difficult to
convince security forces that they didn't provide shelter to
suspected rebels.</TE>
<TE>   Qaisar Ahmad tells the story of his grandfather, Ghulam
Mohi-ud-din Parray, 75, who lives on the outskirts of Srinagar and in
January saw his house destroyed in a battle between militants and
government forces.</TE>
<TE>   Ahmad says that after some guerrillas forcibly entered the home,
Parray pleaded with them to leave. When that failed, he walked out,
handed the house keys to a police search party and told officers
about the armed men inside, Ahmad says.</TE>
<TE>   But after watching his house come under fire, Parray was arrested
on charges of harboring militants, the grandson says.</TE>
<TE>   "Rebuilding our home is hardly a priority right now," Ahmad said.
"I am running from pillar to post to get my grandfather released."</TE>

<HD>Laying the Dead to Rest--Again</HD>
<DH>Venezuela: Despite abandoning other traditions, a Wayuu
Indian clan returns to the graveyard, alcohol in hand, to clean the
bones of a relative.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SUSANNAH A. NESMITH</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS WRITER</BD>
<DL>GUARERO, Venezuela</DL>
<LD>Family members gather around the tomb as the bones of a cherished son
are gently removed and washed with whiskey and champagne. After two
days of hard drinking and prayer, the remains are put back into the
tomb to join ancestors.</LD>
<LD>   For generations beyond remembering, the Wayuu Indians of northern
Colombia and Venezuela have performed this rite--the reburying of the
dead. But the ritual, which has evolved to include a Catholic Mass,
is fading from their dry, wind-swept land as most of the
300,000-member Wayuu nation take on the ways of modern society.</LD>
<LD>   Anthropologists say the Wayuu hold the ceremony to prevent the
souls of the dead from having to eternally wander the Earth. But the
members of the Paz clan had trouble explaining the tradition when
they gathered in this desert town near Venezuela's border with
Colombia to rebury one of their own.</LD>
<TE>   Many family members said the ceremony--performed for a 29-year-old
father of four who was slain nine years ago--would be their last.</TE>
<TE>   "Most of us are professionals now," explained Anelsy Paz, a sister
of the dead man. "I think this is the last time."</TE>
<TE>   Tradition prohibits mentioning the name of the deceased once his
or her body is exhumed, and some family members asked journalists who
were invited to the ceremony to respect the custom.</TE>
<TE>   The ceremony began before dawn, because the old women who guard
the traditions say the dead don't like daylight. But it took hours
for all the relatives to arrive, and the tomb wasn't opened until
well after sunrise, after the last four-wheel-drive vehicle pulled
into the cemetery.</TE>
<TE>   A cousin, a dental hygienist from Maracaibo, was chosen to clean
the bones. She began by downing a shot of whiskey, and then another.</TE>
<TE>   "I have to be drunk. That's not new--that's traditional, the way
they always did it," said Floriana Paz, lifting a blue paper surgical
mask with a latex-gloved hand.</TE>
<TE>   The women, many wearing long, loose dresses called mantas, others
in tight jeans and low-cut blouses, gathered around as Floriana went
to work. The men hung back, some wearing cowboy hats, with pistols
tucked into their belts, standard gear in the lawless frontier
region. They pulled bottles of whiskey from a pickup truck to keep
the liquor flowing.</TE>
<TE>   As the casket was pulled out of the tomb, the dead man's mother
wept, covering her face with a scarf. The remains were sprinkled with
whiskey and champagne, the drinks he had enjoyed.</TE>
<TE>   Anthropologist Wilder Guerra says the Wayuu believe the reburial,
usually performed a decade or so after death, reunites the dead with
their ancestors.</TE>
<TE>   Floriana Paz carefully stripped the remaining flesh from each
bone, though she was a bit vague on the meaning of the ritual.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a beautiful tradition," she said. "But we're very
Westernized; I was married to an American. We don't live this way
anymore."</TE>
<TE>   Her task was gruesome because the body had been treated with
formaldehyde before its Catholic burial and was still partially
preserved.</TE>
<TE>   When she finished the cleaning, the bones were packed into a
marble box. The older women, many in their 70s and 80s with wrinkles
carved into suntanned faces, gathered around the box for what the
Wayuu call the "Second Sob." Weeping in a ritualized singsong, they
covered their faces with towels, washcloths and scarves.</TE>
<TE>   Children scooted in and out of the group, laughing and playing,
oblivious to the ancient ritual. The younger women and all the men
stood at a distance and watched.</TE>
<TE>   The marble box was taken to the family ranch and placed on a
flower-strewn altar in a thatch-roofed pavilion.</TE>
<TE>   The oldest women sat vigil, some weeping over the box. Others
chatted quietly in Wayuu, exchanging family gossip and recalling the
days of bride prices, when a Wayuu groom had to come up with enough
cattle and gold to cover the cost of maintaining his widow if he
died.</TE>
<TE>   A Catholic priest came to celebrate Mass.</TE>
<TE>   About 400 friends and relatives turned out for the two-day feast
at the ranch. Twenty women cooked regional specialties, including
stewed goat and mutton, homemade cheese, plantains and yucca, and a
dish made from cow's blood. Out of respect for the dead, there was no
music, but the gathering was kept well lubricated with whiskey and
beer.</TE>
<TE>   Traditionally, the woman handling the bones is not supposed to
sleep or eat for 48 hours, or even hold her own drinking glass, in
order to avoid contamination from the spirit she has awakened.</TE>
<TE>   Anelsy Paz, the dead man's sister, had spent three months
preparing for the gathering, mostly out of respect for her ailing
72-year-old mother, Dionisia Paz.</TE>
<TE>   "I wanted to do this before I died," the older woman said. "My
daughters wouldn't have done it after I go. This is over now."</TE>

<HD>Russia Is Fertile Ground for Chinese Workers</HD>
<DH>Agriculture: Amid rise of capitalism, migrants in a steady
stream snap up seasonal jobs on the country's low-tech,
labor-intensive farms.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SARAH KARUSH</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS WRITER</BD>
<DL>YERZOVKA, Russia</DL>
<LD>As the midday sun glared down fiercely on the Russian steppe, a dozen
farm workers put down their hoes and picked up their chopsticks to
enjoy a taste of home: beef and string bean stir-fry with traditional
Chinese steamed bread.</LD>
<LD>   Such scenes are becoming more common in the Russian heartland as
farmers cope with the reluctance of their countrymen to do farm
labor. Chinese men and women -- willing to work from dawn until
nightfall and to sleep in cramped, makeshift barracks -- have eagerly
stepped in.</LD>
<LD>   For years, China's ever-growing population has been spilling over
into Russia, giving rise to fears that Moscow could lose its Pacific
regions. There are no exact numbers on the Chinese in the country,
but estimates range from 200,000 to 5 million.</LD>
<TE>   Most of the Chinese remain in the Russian Far East, but some have
begun venturing deeper into the country. Throughout Siberia and
European Russia, they arrive with legitimate work visas to do
seasonal work on the country's low-tech, labor-intensive farms.</TE>
<TE>   The stream of Chinese workers into Russia has coincided with a
strengthening of ties between the two nations, which were bitter
rivals during the Soviet era. However, the force bringing Chinese
workers over the border is not politics, but capitalism -- something
both countries now embrace.</TE>
<TE>   In the Volgograd region this year, about 550 miles southeast of
Moscow, 232 Chinese are working on several farms cultivating
vegetables, including the fragrant and juicy tomatoes that the region
is known for.</TE>
<TE>   For seven months, they sleep in metal trailers, plastic tents or,
if they're lucky, mud huts. The huts, which the Chinese build
themselves, have the advantage of staying cool under the scorching
midsummer sun and retaining a stove's heat during the freezing
temperatures of the early spring and late fall.</TE>
<TE>   The workers toil from 5 a.m. until 9 p.m. seven days a week,
bending over to gather heads of cabbage and wielding hoes to rip
weeds from rows of eggplant and peppers.</TE>
<TE>   "The hardest part is that we don't understand the language," Wang
Congjing, 50, said through an interpreter as she and other workers
snacked on fresh bread after rinsing their hands in an irrigation
ditch.</TE>
<TE>   The workers, mostly peasants from China's northern Jilin province,
rarely leave the fields or mingle with Russians. Each group of a
dozen or so -- known as a brigade -- has a cook and an interpreter
for communicating with their employer and the produce dealers who
drive their trucks into the fields to buy the harvest.</TE>
<TE>   The farmers offer no guaranteed wage but simply split their
profits with the workers. Workers said they hope to bring home $800
to $1,000 each at the end of the season.</TE>
<TE>   "Everything is growing well. We have good cabbage and tomatoes,
but who knows whether the price will be good?" said Shi Xiaomei, the
interpreter for a brigade of 13 workers.</TE>
<TE>   For Shi, a 25-year-old who taught Russian in the city of
Changchun, the hardest part of the job is not being able to leave the
farm. Her fiance is working in the neighboring Russian region of
Kalmykia, but since no one else in her brigade speaks Russian, she
can't take time to visit him.</TE>
<TE>   Another difficulty is the heat. The Volgograd region sees little
rain, and summer temperatures are consistently above 85 degrees. At
home in Jilin province, the climate is cooler and damper, the workers
say.</TE>
<TE>   Ilya Rusnachenko, the first local farmer to hire Chinese workers
four years ago, admires their ability to adapt to the harsh
conditions.</TE>
<TE>   "They are an enterprising people. Put them in any situation and
they'll find a way out. But send a Russian to China, and he would be
lost," Rusnachenko said.</TE>
<TE>   After noting the success of Rusnachenko's farm, regional officials
this year asked him to help bring in Chinese workers for other farms
besides the 58 he hired to work his 395 acres.</TE>
<TE>   Residents of the fairly prosperous Volgograd region don't seem
bothered by the presence of Chinese workers, but they rarely see
them. The work leaves the Chinese little time to venture out, and few
speak enough Russian to do so.</TE>
<TE>   In Moscow and other cities, Chinese are occasionally a target of
racist attacks. And from time to time, Russian news media stoke
tensions with stories about a "Chinese invasion" of the Russian Far
East.</TE>
<TE>   Rusnachenko said a lack of Russians willing to do farm work forced
him to look elsewhere for workers on his farm in Yerzovka, on the
banks of the Volga River. Before the Chinese, he relied on migrants
from the former Soviet republic of Tajikistan, but that ended when
train service between that impoverished country and Russian cities
was halted over concerns about drug trafficking.</TE>
<TE>   Finding enough hands to bring in the harvest has long been a
problem in Russia, with its high levels of urbanization and declining
population. In the Soviet era, students, soldiers and even scientists
were sent for several weeks a year to toil on collective farms.</TE>
<TE>   "Today, nobody's going to give you free labor," Rusnachenko said.</TE>
<TE>   Russian farmers have compelling reasons for choosing Chinese
labor, said Vilya Gelbras, a Moscow-based expert on Chinese migration
to Russia.</TE>
<TE>   For one thing, he said, the Chinese are less likely to drink
heavily than rural Russians.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, their agricultural know-how is well suited to the
small farms of today's Russia. In contrast, Russian peasants lost
much of their farming skills during decades of Soviet
collectivization that turned them into specialized workers on huge
factory-like farms, Gelbras said.</TE>
<TE>   "The Chinese peasant has remained a peasant," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Most workers on Rusnachenko's farm said they had no intention of
remaining in Russia and wanted only to earn some money to improve
their lives in China.</TE>
<TE>   But the foreman, Cai Wengrui, who has 10 years of experience in
Russia and command of the language, said he could envision a life in
Russia -- if only he could find a legal way to bring his family.</TE>
<TE>   "Home is home," he said with a shrug, "but you have to make a
living."</TE>

<HD>Chronicling the Basques: Recordings of Immigrants' Lives
Available on Internet</HD>
<DH>History: In 1999, leaders in Spain kicked off a four-year
effort for 'diaspora communities' to collect histories of migrating
families.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAN GALLAGHER</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS WRITER</BD>
<DL>BOISE, Idaho</DL>
<LD>Generations after Basques from Spain and France came to work in the
West's sheep camps and boardinghouses, their descendants can hear
their voices and glimpse their faces on the Internet.</LD>
<LD>   The Center for Basque Studies at the University of Nevada in Reno
and the Basque Museum and Cultural Center in Boise are chronicling
the immigrants' lives.</LD>
<LD>   "They had fantastic experiences in their lives. We have social
questions: Why did they leave the Basque country? What are their
origins?" said Gloria Totoricaguena, an assistant professor in Reno.</LD>
<TE>   The Basque immigrants came from a region straddling the Pyrenees
mountains. They arrived in the American West during the early part of
the 20th century, working often as sheepherders and later as
ranchers.</TE>
<TE>   The Boise area has the largest Basque population in North America
with 15,000 people. Argentina has the largest number of Basque
residents outside of the Basque homeland of Euzkadi.</TE>
<TE>   In 1999, Basque leaders in Spain kicked off a four-year effort for
those "diaspora communities" to collect histories of people and
provided grants to finance the effort.</TE>
<TE>   The Boise museum and the Reno center have interviewed Basques for
years. Daniel and Mikel Chertudi of Boise continue to record the
interviews, and the hundreds of records are being converted for the
Internet.</TE>
<TE>   The Boise museum will have about 400 interviews posted by this
fall, said Executive Director Patty Miller.</TE>
<TE>   The Web sites also include photographs, immigration documents and
wedding certificates. The effort is called "Oroitzapenak," which is
Basque for "memories."</TE>
<TE>   Eventually, the other Basque communities will develop their own
sites, museum curator Jeff Johns said.</TE>
<TE>   "They can actually hear their ancestors or relatives," said Jill
Berner, a spokeswoman for the Reno center. "What a fabulous thing for
a young Basque American girl to hear her grandmother talk about her
experiences."</TE>
<TE>   The number of surviving Basque immigrants in the West is
dwindling. Their children are also getting on in years.</TE>
<TE>   Some lived through calamitous events, including the Spanish Civil
War's 1937 bombing of Guernica, their spiritual capital. German
bombers flying on behalf of Francisco Franco dropped 130,000 pounds
of explosives and reduced the village to rubble.</TE>
<TE>   "There's a sense of urgency to record these people," Totoricaguena
said. "The ones who were old enough to remember the bombing are now
almost getting too old to remember."</TE>
<TE>   The immigrants often moved to areas where friends and relatives
preceded them, she said. Many of the French Basques ended up in San
Francisco. Boise's population is mainly from the Spanish province of
Viscaya, which includes Guernica.</TE>
<TE>   Basque leaders have also sponsored books about the Basque ethnic
clubs around the globe. Totoricaguena has written a book about
Boise's community and a chapter in another about New York.</TE>
<TE>   Within five years, Totoricaguena will travel to the Basque country
to interview the people left behind by their friends and relatives
who moved away.</TE>
<TE>   While Basques started migrating to America in the 1800s, it is
this generation that is setting down their families' stories, Miller
said.</TE>
<TE>   "It's like many ethnic groups," Miller said. "Grandfather chooses
to forget his roots. The first generation is just trying to feed
their families. The second generation is playing football and eating
chorizo sausages. The third generation is looking back at their
history."</TE>

<HD>Plastic Bridge Will Take Cars Into the 21st Century</HD>
<DH>Construction: Vermont span is equipped with fiber-optic
sensors to monitor wear. Glass- fiber reinforced polymer is used
instead of steel.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID GRAM</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS WRITER</BD>
<DL>MORRISTOWN, Vt.</DL>
<LD>It's taken two years into the new millennium, but the state of
Vermont is about to complete its bridge to the 21st century.</LD>
<LD>   It's not a political slogan, but an actual bridge, reinforced with
plastic and outfitted with fiber-optic sensors that allow traffic and
stress on the structure to be monitored from 50 miles away.</LD>
<LD>   Its designers say it will be the first bridge of its kind in the
world--unique in that neither of the two layers of the reinforcement
bar, or rebar, grid that give strength to its concrete deck is made
of steel.</LD>
<TE>   Instead, they've been built out of "glass-fiber reinforced
polymer," which engineers say has a distinct advantage over
traditional steel: It doesn't corrode. That's a key consideration in
a state where roads and bridges take a beating every winter from ice,
snow and road salt.</TE>
<TE>   The high-tech bridge sits between farmers' fields and runs 144
feet across the Ryder Brook, a tributary of the Lamoille River, on
heavily traveled Route 100 between Morrisville and Stowe.</TE>
<TE>   About 7,000 vehicles a day are expected to cross it after it opens
in the fall; they're doing so now on a temporary bridge on the detour
that dips down around the construction site.</TE>
<TE>   Thirty-four-feet wide, it replaces a bridge that was just 21 feet
from curb to curb and at least once has seen two large trucks become
wedged between its rails and back traffic up for miles.</TE>
<TE>   Ray Hayes, resident engineer and project manager, and Tom Lackey,
design engineer with the state Agency of Transportation in
Montpelier, spent half an hour one recent morning inside a
weather-beaten green construction trailer flipping through the design
drawings for the bridge.</TE>
<TE>   Hayes, a Morrisville native, made clear that he's taking the whole
idea of being a bridge construction pioneer easily in stride. "I
haven't gotten very excited about it, tell you the truth," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The new rebar is easier to work with because it's lighter, he
said: less than half a pound per foot as opposed to a pound and a
half for the steel.</TE>
<TE>   "Some of these bars we use are 30 feet long. You see two guys grab
10 of them at once and bring them somewhere--it's different from what
we're accustomed to," he added with a smile.</TE>
<TE>   The polymer costs a bit more than traditional steel. It will add
about $50,000 to the bridge's $1.4-million price tag--with the
difference covered by a federal grant. But it's expected to at least
double what otherwise would be expected to be a 40-year life span for
the bridge's deck.</TE>
<TE>   Phil Phelps, construction foreman for the general contractor, Blow
&amp; Cote Inc. of Morrisville, said his crew considered the plastic
rebar a mixed blessing.</TE>
<TE>   "It's rough," he said of the material's texture. "It's hard on
your hands. But in fact putting it in is quite easy because it's
light."</TE>
<TE>   Aside from the plastic innards, the bridge has other features that
make it unusual, at least within Vermont, Lackey said.</TE>
<TE>   Traditional bridges have bearings at either end, where the
abutments meet the deck, to allow for expansion and contraction with
the weather. The Ryder Brook bridge instead features a system called
"integral abutments," which pivot slightly from the bottom, where
they're better protected from the elements.</TE>
<TE>   Another feature common in other states but not in Vermont is that
the bridge will have a bare concrete deck, rather than one covered in
asphalt.</TE>
<TE>   The advantage: "When the deck starts to rot, you can see it,"
Lackey said.</TE>
<TE>   It was a long and hectic day in May when a crew of 18 gathered at
the bridge to pour the concrete deck, Hayes recalled. Some spots
still need a bit of touching up.</TE>
<TE>   "Everybody else is satisfied with it, but I'm not," said Hayes,
who freely acknowledged that he's something of a perfectionist.</TE>
<TE>   Aside from the human eyes checking the concrete deck for signs of
wear, there will be the fiber-optic sensors.</TE>
<TE>   Reading the printouts from them will be Brahim Benmokrane, a
professor of civil engineering at Quebec's University of Sherbrooke.</TE>
<TE>   Benmokrane "asked if he could come down and put some sensors in
our bridge. We said sure," Lackey said.</TE>
<TE>   Benmokrane, who was trained in Switzerland, said he and his team
of researchers will be monitoring the bridge to see how well the
plastic rebar holds up over time. The monitors will also allow the
team to track temperatures at the bridge, the stresses that are being
put on the structure and even the weight of individual vehicles
traveling over it.</TE>
<TE>   Benmokrane said he expects such sensors to become more common in
bridges and buildings in the coming years, with the main purpose
being "structural health monitoring. If it needs repairs, if there is
something going wrong, you can know it."</TE>

<HD>With Grid-Pattern Projects in Again, It May Be a Dead End
for Cul-De-Sacs</HD>
<DH>Development: Residents may feel safer on these streets, but
experts say they create traffic gridlock and isolation. Grid-pattern
projects are making a comeback.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KRISTEN COMER</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS WRITER</BD>
<DL>MASON, Ohio</DL>
<LD>Jenny and Rick White enjoy living on their cozy cul-de-sac, where
traffic is light and neighbors are friendly.</LD>
<LD>   "There are a lot of advantages," she said. "It's safer for kids
because people don't drive as fast and we know everyone who lives on
this street."</LD>
<LD>   People cherish the privacy and peace of mind that they get from
living on suburban dead-end streets. Children can ride their bicycles
without worrying about heavy traffic. Usually, the people driving by
belong here and often meet for parties or barbecues.</LD>
<TE>   Because so few vehicles travel streets with no outlet, residents
say they are free from noise and heavy exhaust fumes.</TE>
<TE>   But the oasis creates traffic gridlock for others, elsewhere,
transportation experts say. And that is one reason planners are
starting to return to traditional developments reminiscent of
neighborhoods in the early 1900s: smaller lots on straight streets in
a grid pattern.</TE>
<TE>   Steven Bodzin, spokesman for San Francisco-based Congress for the
New Urbanism, said there are about 250 grid-pattern developments
throughout the country, with hundreds more being planned.</TE>
<TE>   "We see a higher level of devotion to the towns and a better sense
of community," he said. "I think people are missing that in
conventional suburbia."</TE>
<TE>   Planners say dead-end streets, which sometimes don't have
sidewalks, can also discourage social interaction, isolating
residents.</TE>
<TE>   "Virtually every trip involves getting in the car, even to get a
gallon of milk or a loaf of bread," said Greg Dale, a
Cincinnati-based urban planning consultant who has worked with
communities nationwide. "People used to be able to walk to the corner
store. Too many cul-de-sacs can create isolation between
neighborhoods. There's a sense of community that's lost."</TE>
<TE>   Ninety-five percent of 120 subdivisions being built outside
Cincinnati in Warren County, where the Whites live, include
cul-de-sacs. The area, once more rural than suburban, is fast
becoming densely developed and populated.</TE>
<TE>   Roger Young, with his wife and three daughters, settled on one of
the dead-end streets two years ago. Safety was a major reason.</TE>
<TE>   "There's a lot of trust between neighbors, a real neighborhood
feeling," he said. "We have Fourth of July parties and block parties
in the summer. If you're teaching your kids to ride their bikes or
sending them out to play, you don't worry at all."</TE>
<TE>   But county engineer Neil Tunison said the few main streets serving
these subdivisions often become clogged with traffic and can create
safety problems.</TE>
<TE>   Bodzin said the neighborhoods also discourage racial and economic
diversity. "In these developments, you usually have one culture,
people of the same economic class," he said. "Studies have shown they
have less interest in their community and belong to fewer social
clubs. Everyone tends to do their own thing instead."</TE>
<TE>   French for "bottom of a sack," the cul-de-sac has been around for
hundreds of years but did not become popular in the United States
until the mid-1950s.</TE>
<TE>   Radburn, N.J., was one of the first cities to use no-outlet
streets, said Jeff Spech, an urban planner and co-author of the book
"Suburban Nation." "The idea was to separate cars from pedestrians,"
he said. "Developers saw that people liked them, so they started
building whole developments of them."</TE>
<TE>   Bodzin said the new movement of returning to grid-patterned
communities started with Seaside, a 1981 development near Panama
City, Fla. Seaside has a town green and retail shops within walking
distance of homes.</TE>
<TE>   Developers throughout the country have followed suit. Change has
been slower in Midwestern communities with few new developments,
Bodzin said.</TE>
<TE>   But other developers say families still find cul-de-sacs
desirable. Jim Obert, planning director for Great Traditions Land &amp;
Development Co. in Cincinnati, said developers get higher prices for
homes and lots on dead-end streets.</TE>
<TE>   The Whites, who have a son in high school and daughter in middle
school, say there are some drawbacks to living on a cul-de-sac.</TE>
<TE>   "In the winter, we're about the last street to get the snow
cleared," Jenny White said.</TE>

<HD>Alabama Delta Proves a Popular Ecotourism Destination</HD>
<DH>Environment: The watery wilderness offers visitors
everything from saltwater flats to cypress and hardwood trees to
marine life and flowers.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GARRY MITCHELL</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS WRITER</BD>
<DL>SPANISH FORT, Ala.</DL>
<LD>With ecotourism on the rise, veteran kayaker Jeff Evans and fishing
guide Craig Key have found the Mobile Delta's watery wilderness to be
a profitable showplace.</LD>
<LD>   Evans' Tensaw Eco Tours and Key's Delta Outdoor Guide Service had
overlapping interests, so the two men became business partners after
meeting at a Chamber of Commerce session.</LD>
<LD>   "We're still bootstrapping it," Key said.</LD>
<TE>   They take people on nature trips, fishing, hunting, birding or
after-dinner air boat rides from two restaurants on the Causeway, the
eight-mile stretch of highway and bridges connecting Mobile to
Baldwin County.</TE>
<TE>   Adventure-seeking visitors to the Delta don't have to stand in
line to shoot the rapids because there aren't any, Evans said. But
the Delta offers a wide array of wildlife, marine life, flowers and
untouched scenery.</TE>
<TE>   Wilderness tourism is a large market in the United States, which
has the most people with this activity profile; it also has the most
wilderness destinations.</TE>
<TE>   The term ecotourism, more popular with young people using the
environment to fulfill a challenge -- like rock climbing or scaling
mountains -- still is unfamiliar to some.</TE>
<TE>   "Never heard of it," Scott Yates of Anniston said during a visit
to Mobile on a rainy break from the beach. He said his family lives
near Cheaha State Park and doesn't have to seek out the wilderness
for leisure. "We're already there."</TE>
<TE>   Tim Donellan of Denham Springs, La., touring Mobile with his
family, said he had always wanted to take a river cruise, but "the
water is not too far from my house. I do a lot of hunting and
fishing."</TE>
<TE>   Evans' Eco Tours, now in its second year but still without its own
Web site, is in one of the Causeway buildings that have survived
hurricanes. Key's fish-camp base is about 32 miles away by water,
near Stockton.</TE>
<TE>   Besides air boats, Evans and Key take visitors by power boat,
barge, canoe or kayak. Key enjoys playing host to smaller groups that
offer more eye-to-eye contact.</TE>
<TE>   Many of their customers are local residents taking out-of-towners
or relatives on trips into familiar areas, looking for where grandpa
had his fishing camp, for example. They offer day or night trips,
making their work schedules unpredictable. "We try to do what people
ask," Evans said in planning his year-round trips. "There's no wait.
A lot of days we go out and we're the only boat around. We're just
developing a business. We're not getting rich off it."</TE>
<TE>   Even in December, the Delta is worth a visit. "The weather in
January and February is not always cooperative," Evans said.</TE>
<TE>   Trips aren't restricted to the Delta. Evans said they also visit
Mobile Bay and the eastern shore of Baldwin County, anchoring at
Middle Bay Lighthouse or over good fishing holes.</TE>
<TE>   Evans, 32, a Mobile native and Birmingham-Southern College
graduate in finance, has a background in the restaurant business. His
love of the Delta began on fishing trips with his father. He still
has the first kayak he built and lives in an apartment above the tour
office on the Causeway.</TE>
<TE>   Key, also 32, grew up at Patrick's Landing, a fish camp in north
Baldwin County.</TE>
<TE>   "My grandfather ran it for 26 years," said Key, who now leases his
own fish camp -- Upper Bryant's Landing -- with his wife. "I run
charter trips from here."</TE>
<TE>   Key has a "party barge" for scheduled trips. His sightseeing
customers all want to see alligators. "That's one of the main
attractions -- gators and wildflowers," he said.</TE>
<TE>   With 400 to 500 square miles of Delta to explore, Key said there
are four popular sections -- saltwater flats, cypress and hardwood
trees, and caves.</TE>
<TE>   "Salt caverns were used back in the 1700s by early settlers," Key
said.</TE>
<TE>   Visitors can go up and down miles of the Delta and never take the
same stream twice.</TE>
<TE>   Ecotourism, a niche market in the massive tourism industry, has
been discussed at meetings of the Scenic Causeway Coalition.</TE>
<TE>   "The coalition is trying to find a common ground between
environmental protection and human use," chairman Robin Delaney said.
"I think that's kind of what ecotourism is about."</TE>

<HD>Iowa Farmer Sows Seeds of Property Tax Relief</HD>
<DH>Bequest: Under terms of Dewey Byar's will, an auction of
his estate will help finance annual rate cuts for property owners in
Des Moines County.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TODD DVORAK</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS WRITER</BD>
<DL>WEST BURLINGTON, Iowa</DL>
<LD>Bachelor farmer Dewey Byar never spoke much, although friends said he
always loved his neighbors for buying his corn, livestock and hay in
this southeastern Iowa river town.</LD>
<LD>   More than two years after dying of cancer, Byar's plan to return
the favor is about to unfold in the form of a tax break for everyone
in Des Moines County.</LD>
<LD>   In accordance with Byar's will, most of the proceeds from the
auction of his estate this weekend will be put in an investment trust
and the annual income will be used to reduce property taxes.</LD>
<TE>   The will does not contain a provision to notify taxpayers.</TE>
<TE>   "Dewey would probably prefer that he not be given any publicity
about it," said William Hildreth, Byar's attorney and author of the
will. "But it shouldn't go unnoticed around here, because it
certainly is a generous act."</TE>
<TE>   Just how generous won't be known until auctioneers try to sell
Byar's farm, home and possessions. Kent Gaudian, an estate executor
and president of West Burlington Bank, said the trust could earn
$75,000 to $150,000 annually, depending on the auction and the rate
of return.</TE>
<TE>   Byar, who died in April 2000 at a 68, was a shy, bashful and
private person, a man who even tried convincing his closest friends
not to publish his obituary in the local newspaper.</TE>
<TE>   Still, those who knew him say Byar's final stroke of civic
generosity is hardly a surprise.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a well-known fact in his neighborhood that he did not like
taxes that were levied by the local, state and federal governments,"
Hildreth said. "I know he also felt that if there was anything he
could do to reduce as much as possible the taxes everyone here pays,
then he was going to do it."</TE>
<TE>   Byar left $22,000 to a few relatives and close friends but nothing
to his two brothers. A fraction of the auction proceeds will be put
into a separate trust that the county can use to maintain where Byar
is buried. The remaining sum will be put into the investment trust
that will help soften the blow of each of the more than 15,300 tax
statements mailed each year by the county auditor. Interest income
will be subtracted from the overall tax levy, thus reducing the
amount that county auditors use to divide among the county's taxable
property.</TE>
<TE>   County Supervisor Tim Hoschek said families here, like others
across the country, are suffering from the struggling economy.</TE>
<TE>   "We've been hit pretty hard with several layoffs and plant
closings," he said, citing lost jobs at the Case-New Holland plant
and the shutdown of the Exide Technologies battery plant last year.</TE>
<TE>   While it is not clear how much the average taxpayer will get from
Byar's bequest, "anything will help," Hoschek said.</TE>
<TE>   "That was a nice gesture of him and hopefully it will work out
that all the people will benefit from it," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Although he served in the Korean War, friends say they can't
remember Byar otherwise leaving Iowa. And aside from his trips to
town, often just to buy ice cream cones for his two dogs, he rarely
left the boundaries of the farm his parents bought in 1951, friends
said.</TE>
<TE>   "I think the time he spent stationed in Missouri and Korea during
the war gave him a chance to see all the world he wanted to see,"
said Richard Osborn, who grew up with Byar and is co-executor of the
estate. "He loved the farm and never found many reasons to leave."</TE>
<TE>   Byar even arranged it so that not even death could separate him
from his land. He is buried in a private, one-plot cemetery he built
along the county road that winds along his farm fields. His black
granite headstone features an etching of his farm, its buildings and
four silos; an arch over the front gate reads "Dewey Byar Farms
Forever."</TE>
<TE>   Osborn said the cemetery summed up Byar's way of living: a
preference for solitude and a love for hard work and the land.</TE>
<TE>   "I always got the impression that he just wanted to work until he
just fell over and died and could be put immediately in the coffin in
his own cemetery," said Tyler Stigge, who worked for Byar for 12
years and helped build the cemetery. "I think he wanted it where it
was so people he knew could just drive by and wave."</TE>

<HD>Fancy Artifacts Found in Dig at Poor Village in the
Northwest</HD>
<DH>Archeology: Students scrape away at Washington site, where
Hudson's Bay laborers lived. Unexpected finds included Spode china.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOSEPH B. FRAZIER</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS WRITER</BD>
<DL>VANCOUVER, Wash.</DL>
<LD>Jeff Isaak plunged his fingers into dirt where a humble home site
stood 150 years ago, plucked out a tiny piece of ceramic and handed
it to archeologist Doug Wilson.</LD>
<LD>   "Staffordshire transfer print, blue and white," Wilson said at a
glance.</LD>
<LD>   That was fancy stuff for the village of the working poor that
supported the once-mighty Hudson's Bay Co. at Ft. Vancouver and its
vast empire in the Northwest in the early and mid-1800s.</LD>
<TE>   What the Staffordshire and other signs of relative affluence were
doing under the dirt-floor homes of dirt-poor workers nobody is sure.
Little is known of the village and the people who worked and lived
there.</TE>
<TE>   But with paintbrushes and trowels, student archeologists scraped
away this summer at the village, the underbelly of the Hudson's Bay
operation.</TE>
<TE>   The farmers, laborers, woodcutters, coopers, bakers and
blacksmiths didn't leave much because they didn't have much.</TE>
<TE>   But from the trade rings and clay pipestems, bits of ceramics,
knives, beads and bones, a look at their lives has begun to emerge.</TE>
<TE>   The five-week project was run jointly by Portland State University
and the National Park Service and will be resumed next summer. The
dig is located outside the walls of the fort, which was restored on
its original site in 1966.</TE>
<TE>   From its founding in 1825 until about 1860, the fort supplied
food, tools and other supplies to fur trappers and its 20 or so
outposts throughout the Northwest.</TE>
<TE>   It was put there by the British to cement their disputed claim to
the Oregon country, to squeeze Americans out and keep peace with the
Indians.</TE>
<TE>   The company's main business, however, was furs, which it bought in
immense quantities and shipped to England for the hat trade.</TE>
<TE>   Much to England's displeasure, weary pioneers at the end of the
Oregon Trail didn't get the cold shoulder from the man who ran Ft.
Vancouver, Dr. John McLoughlin. They got food, tools, credit and
other aid that allowed them to counter the British presence with
their own.</TE>
<TE>   When the Northwest went to the United States in 1846, the
Canadian-born physician moved to Oregon City, became an American
citizen and is known today as the "Father of Oregon."</TE>
<TE>   The fort and its support base were the beginning of agriculture,
lumbering and fishing in the Northwest.</TE>
<TE>   "Missionaries called it 'the New York of the West,' where you
could buy European goods in the wilderness," said Wilson, who is in
charge of archeology at the Vancouver National Historic Reserve. "The
reports got people jazzed about coming West."</TE>
<TE>   Hudson's Bay officers and clerks lived in relative comfort within
the fort.</TE>
<TE>   But the food, the lumber, the blacksmithing and other necessities
that fueled the company's empire had to come from somewhere. An order
sent home to England wouldn't arrive for two to three years.</TE>
<TE>   Enter the "engages," who may have numbered 600 to 1,000 and lived
a cruder life in simple huts outside the fort walls.</TE>
<TE>   It is their village that is drawing the attention of archeologists
bent on finding out who these people were and what their lives were
like.</TE>
<TE>   "There were French Canadians, Hawaiians, Indians, Russians, Scots
and English, and they all seemed to live in relative harmony here,"
Wilson said. "Most were illiterate, so they didn't write anything.
All we know was written by the people in the fort and by the
missionaries, and it's a pretty biased view, an imperfect view of the
village."</TE>
<TE>   A Hawaiian laborer got 10 pounds a year; other common workers got
17 pounds. Skilled engages did a little better. McLoughlin, the
"chief factor," might have expected 600 to 800 pounds if the company
had a good year.</TE>
<TE>   But low wages aside, excavators found signs of unexplained
affluence.</TE>
<TE>   Isaak said 98% of the china they are finding is Spode, the
supplier to the royal family and a Hudson's Bay monopoly at the time.</TE>
<TE>   "It's interesting to find china like what was on the chief
factor's table, where the gentlemen ate, out here in the village,"
Wilson said.</TE>
<TE>   One answer, he said, is that as things wore out in the fort, they
were recycled down to the villagers. Or the engages, some of whom
lived in the village for many years, may have gotten desperate for
something special, hang the cost.</TE>
<TE>   "We're finding shagreen enamel designs," said Shingo Hamada, one
of the students patiently probing the home site. "It was expensive.
They had been finding that only inside the fort. The question is, why
are we finding it in the houses. Hudson's Bay laborers lived here."</TE>
<TE>   Bits of Chinese porcelain also showed up. "Chinese porcelain isn't
supposed to be here," Isaak said. "That's East India Co."</TE>
<TE>   Stone flakes also have turned up, a sign that the Indian women
many of the engages married retained their native ways.</TE>
<TE>   A laboratory at the fort analyzes what is found, from bones, to
determine what people ate; to tiny beads the size of a seed; to bits
of glass and ceramics.</TE>
<TE>   A small display in the laboratory includes a dime and a quarter
from the 1830s that were perforated, apparently for use in a
necklace.</TE>
<TE>   The seemingly endless bits of pipe stems confirmed a popular
pastime.</TE>
<TE>   "Smoking was the thing to do," said park guide Edward Reidell, who
also directs some archeological projects. "Men, women, kids, they all
smoked. "</TE>
<TE>   The company stayed at the fort for a few years after the Northwest
went to the United States, but withdrew to Canada as the U.S. Army
moved in. The Army moved off the villagers. Decay and fire destroyed
what was left of the village by 1866.</TE>
<TE>   But the site continues to yield clues to the hazy histories of the
village residents. The village area and the fort site have given up
more than 1.5 million artifacts since explorations began in 1948.
Findings go to a lab in the fort for analysis and cataloging.</TE>
<TE>   "The village was an amazing place. It is the premiere
archeological site in the Pacific Northwest, and it's important that
the story not be lost," Wilson said.</TE>

<HD>Woman Is Guilty Over Collecting Insurance</HD>
<DH>Courts: She is convicted of mail and wire fraud for
receiving thousands of dollars on policies of slain lovers, and faces
trial on murder charges in two of the deaths.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEPHEN MANNING</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS WRITER</BD>
<DL>GREENBELT, Md.</DL>
<LD>A woman was convicted of fraud Friday for collecting thousands of
dollars in life insurance on three slain lovers after allegedly using
voodoo threats for years to keep witnesses silent.</LD>
<LD>   Josephine Gray was charged with murder after the first two deaths
in 1974 and 1990, but the charges were dropped after witnesses
wouldn't testify.</LD>
<LD>   The murder charges were refiled in January because witnesses
agreed to testify after learning that Gray would remain in jail
pending the fraud trial.</LD>
<TE>   The federal jury found Gray, 55, guilty of mail and wire fraud and
other charges. She faces up to 40 years in prison when she is
sentenced Dec. 2.</TE>
<TE>   Citing a gag order that extends to the sentencing date, federal
prosecutors and Gray's defense attorneys wouldn't comment on the
verdict. Relatives of Gray's former husbands also didn't make
statements, but shouted "Amen!" outside the courthouse.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors said Gray created fear in her family by threatening
them with voodoo curses and violence if they spoke to authorities.</TE>
<TE>   According to court documents, searches of Gray's home turned up
voodoo materials and dolls resembling Gray's relatives pierced with
needles.</TE>
<TE>   The federal fraud conviction bolsters the state murder case
because they share the same evidence, Montgomery County prosecutor
Douglas Gansler said.</TE>
<TE>   "They had to prove the murders to show that there indeed was
insurance fraud," he said. No trial date has been set in the murders.</TE>
<TE>   Gray's first husband, Norman Stribbling, was shot to death in
1974, and she collected $16,000 from his life insurance policy.</TE>
<TE>   Murder charges against Gray and her then-boyfriend, William Gray,
were dropped after witnesses failed to testify. The two eventually
married.</TE>
<TE>   William Gray was found shot to death Nov. 9, 1990, shortly after
an accidental death policy was issued in his name. Police charged
Josephine Gray and her boyfriend, Clarence Goode, with murder, but
the charges were again dropped because key witnesses did not testify.
Gray received $50,000 in insurance payments for his death.</TE>
<TE>   Goode was found shot to death in Baltimore in 1996, with Gray
receiving $95,000 from his insurance.</TE>
<TE>   Charges have never been filed in Goode's death.</TE>

<HD>Nursing Camp Gives Teenagers Early Exposure</HD>
<DH>Careers: Program's creators want to help younger students
focus on their futures in a profession that needs workers.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HOLLY RAMER</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS WRITER</BD>
<DL>MANCHESTER, N.H.</DL>
<LD>By the end of the week, Heidy Rodriguez will know how to check a
patient's blood pressure, temperature and pulse. She'll know her way
around the operating room, intensive-care unit and maternity ward.
She'll learn how to calm infants and comfort the elderly.</LD>
<LD>   Then she'll go back to junior high.</LD>
<LD>   Thirteen-year-old Heidy is spending a rigorous two weeks at a day
camp designed to expose preteens and young teenagers to the nursing
profession.</LD>
<TE>   "I never thought you could make a bed with someone in it!" she
said, marveling at the skills she's learned in just a few days.</TE>
<TE>   "It's really exciting. I thought nurses just gave shots, but it's
so much more. Nurses do everything."</TE>
<TE>   Although specialized summer camps are nothing new, they usually
target older teens. But the nursing camp's creators at St. Anselm
College wanted to help young students focus on their futures before
they reach high school.</TE>
<TE>   "We think we're doing kids a favor by telling them, 'The world is
your oyster,' but what we hear is they're overwhelmed by choices,"
said Sylvia Durette, a faculty member at the college and the camp's
director. "We want to them to know more about themselves, and we want
them to know more about nursing."</TE>
<TE>   A similar camp -- for boys only -- operates in South Carolina, and
a two-day camp for preteen boys and girls is in Ohio.</TE>
<TE>   At this Manchester camp, which has no formal name, bandaging and
bed-making replace arts and crafts. There are no campfires or
sing-alongs, but plenty to keep the campers -- 27 girls and one boy
-- busy.</TE>
<TE>   Classroom instruction is offered at the college campus, plus there
are trips to area medical facilities where campers practice their
skills. Although one long-term goal is to ease the state's nursing
shortage, short-term benefits abound -- the campers are learning
empathy and communication skills, and they're having fun.</TE>
<TE>   Dressed in blue scrubs with stethoscopes slung around their necks,
one group of girls spent a morning making beds at Hanover Hill Health
Care Center and helping residents with their lunches.</TE>
<TE>   "Gross!" one girl says when Heidy returns from a room where a
patient recently died. But Heidy is calm, mature. She points to the
signs outside each room that have pictures of each resident.</TE>
<TE>   "I wanted to see who it was, but they were already taking her
picture down," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Bridget Lynch, a St. Anselm senior, licensed practical nurse and
camp counselor, said she hopes that even campers who decide nursing
isn't for them will leave with a new respect for themselves and
others.</TE>
<TE>   "These girls didn't know how much heart and love they have in
them," she said.</TE>
<TE>   "More than anything, they need this hands-on time. It builds their
self-esteem and confidence."</TE>
<TE>   Campers pay nothing for the two-week session, thanks to the
Manchester School to Career Partnership, which received a state grant
to connect kids to careers in health care.</TE>
<TE>   "Everyone is talking about the nursing shortage, but concrete
projects were far and few between," said Clint Jones, business
liaison for the partnership.</TE>
<TE>   According to a recent study by the nonprofit corporation
Foundation for Healthy Communities, New Hampshire is producing only
half the nursing graduates it needs to battle the shortage. The
number of registered nurses in New Hampshire is expected to increase
by 5.5% by 2006, half of the projected 11% national increase.</TE>
<TE>   Nursing homes have a particularly tough time recruiting nurses and
aides. The American Health Care Assn. estimates that more than
123,000 nursing positions are vacant at long-term care facilities
throughout the country.</TE>
<TE>   Although it will be years before any of the campers enter the work
force, Ted Lee, president of Hanover Hill, said they will be worth
waiting for. The home, which has started to recruit nurses and aides
overseas, relished the opportunity to show the campers a variety of
career opportunities, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a wonderful opportunity to get kids in here at an early
age," he said. "They can see there's a future in it."</TE>
<TE>   Many campers had never been in a nursing home before. But they
soon overcame their shyness.</TE>
<TE>   "Old people are so cool!" said 14-year-old Katie Silveria of
Loudon, who quickly corrected herself, substituting "elderly" for
"old."</TE>
<TE>   Although some of her friends teased her about attending the camp,
Katie said she thoroughly enjoyed herself.</TE>
<TE>   "I used to think it was doctors doing everything," she said. "Now
I know the nurses do everything."</TE>

<HD>Descendants Find Honor in Link to Slaves</HD>
<DH>History: Tracing one's roots to slavery can be challenging,
but several organizations can assist with the genealogical research.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MELANIE COFFEE</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS WRITER</BD>
<DL>CHICAGO</DL>
<LD>Janis Minor Forte found her great-grandfather in a jail document: He
was listed among the possessions his owner had lost in a bet.</LD>
<LD>   "Needless to say, I let out a holler," Forte said. The discovery
was chilling and exhilarating: "a certain Negro man slave, Walton,
about 26 years of age and of black complexion."</LD>
<LD>   Forte had found another slave in her family tree.</LD>
<TE>   People have been searching for their roots in slavery for decades,
and the personal journeys became more popular after the 1977
television miniseries based on Alex Haley's novel "Roots." Many
people start tracing their lineage with hope of finding an African
slave, so that they might find their links to Africa -- the
motherland.</TE>
<TE>   The International Society of Sons and Daughters of Slave Ancestry
offers research tools such as a slave database, oral histories, old
photographs, census data and birth and death certificates.</TE>
<TE>   Several other groups assist in genealogical research, but this
Chicago-based organization specializes in slave ancestry, and a
proven link to a slave is a requirement for membership.</TE>
<TE>   The organization helps would-be members comb through aged, fragile
and incomplete documents that can reveal pieces of a puzzle: A last
name. An age. A slave's price.</TE>
<TE>   Tracing roots to slavery can be difficult. Often, families were
split apart at the auction block and slaves were not given last
names, or their names were changed.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a tremendous challenge, but in most cases there is a light
at the end of the tunnel," said Charles Blockson, a black history
expert at Temple University in Philadelphia.</TE>
<TE>   Forte, of Chicago, traveled to Eutaw, Ala., for her search. She
found the 1856 document that named her great-grandfather, Walton, and
his owner, a man named Minor, her maiden name.</TE>
<TE>   Walton had been a farmer who married twice and had at least eight
children, she learned from research.</TE>
<TE>   "It lifts him up off of a page; he's just not another name on a
death certificate or a birth certificate," Forte said. "He becomes a
real person."</TE>
<TE>   Forte, a longtime member of the society, had found slaves in her
background before. She began searching at her father's request. He
grew up hearing stories about his own father's impoverished childhood
on a farm in Alabama.</TE>
<TE>   Her great-great-great aunt, Maria Head, used to tell of being
stolen from her parents when she was a child in Madagascar.</TE>
<TE>   Forte found the will of Head's owner, which showed that Maria Head
had been purchased in Mobile, Ala., after she arrived on a slave ship
from Madagascar.</TE>
<TE>   "I truly believe if we would have been told ... that our ancestors
were strong and powerful and great people, there wouldn't be as many
racial issues as there are now," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Robert Williams of Chicago takes pride in knowing he is related to
Benjamin Banneker, a self-taught scientist who helped develop the
layout of Washington, D.C., in 1791. Williams learned about his ties
to Banneker through government documents, family Bibles, books on
Banneker and oral history--stories passed on through generations. He
too is a member of the organization.</TE>
<TE>   "It makes you feel good when you know you're related to someone
who had something specific to do with American history," said
Williams, who is Banneker's fourth grandnephew.</TE>
<TE>   Williams also found an African-born slave in his family --
Banneker's maternal grandfather.</TE>
<TE>   "If Benjamin Banneker had not been famous then I would not have
even known about the African slave," Williams said. "These people
helped build our country and enrich this nation."</TE>
<TE>   Interest in researching family ties to slavery has increased as
the debate on slave reparations grows.</TE>
<TE>   Three federal lawsuits seeking reparations accuse corporations of
profiting from the slave trade. The lawsuits are the first of what
some expect to be a wave of complaints seeking reparations.</TE>
<TE>   Former schoolteacher Patricia Bearden used to avoid watching films
and reading books about slavery. The degradation, sorrow and
inhumanity hurt too much. Now, she says, she has the strength to
immerse herself in that history.</TE>
<TE>   "I want to know, to keep understanding and get through the hurt
and the pain because our people got through it too," Bearden said.
"We're not moaning and groaning about 'Oh, look what somebody did to
us.' We want to look at our people in a way that we can celebrate
them and honor them so we can feel good in our hearts about them
surviving and enduring."</TE>
<TE>   Bearden's links to slavery are Margaret and Emmons Parrish,
siblings born in the United States who were slaves on a plantation in
Pontotoc County, Miss.</TE>
<TE>   Bearden, who is president and a founder of the slave genealogical
society, used census data, deeds and court documents to find
information on her great-great-grandfather, Emmons Parrish. She
traveled to Jackson and Aberdeen, Miss., to find death certificates
and land records. She also hired a researcher in Mississippi who
helped her find an 1838 estate inventory that listed Emmons and
Margaret Parrish as property, along with chairs, a waffle iron and
champagne bottles.</TE>
<TE>   Emmons Parrish was valued at $300, Margaret at $450.</TE>
<TE>   The document is stark, cold. "We the undersigned do certify that
the above and forgoing list of articles with valuation thereto
annexed contains a full and true account of all the goods, chattles
and personal estate of David W. Parrish," it says.</TE>
<TE>   "I've gotten past seeing that he was on a bill of sale," Bearden
said. "If I stay in that moment, then I'm not doing myself any good,
wallowing in the fact that he was considered a piece of property. I
know that he was a human being."</TE>
<TE>   Bearden continues to trace her roots with the intention of finding
a slave ancestor who was born in Africa.</TE>
<TE>   "To find the African is part of you, it's part of your history and
it would dispel that myth that we can't find our people," Bearden
said. "It would help tell our story more fully because then you could
go back to Africa. If I found mine, I'd be as proud as a peacock."</TE>

<HD>Long Gone but Not Forgotten: Town Stakes Claim to Wilson
Library</HD>
<DH>History: Although the nation's 28th president didn't spend
much time in Staunton, Va., residents seek to mark his contributions.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRIS KAHN</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS WRITER</BD>
<DL>STAUNTON, Va.</DL>
<LD>Woodrow Wilson lived in an old whitewashed house in this town for
just a year after his birth. He returned only briefly in college
before becoming the nation's 28th president.</LD>
<LD>   But locals aren't letting Wilson's lack of time in Staunton keep
them from moving forward with plans to build a presidential library
in his honor--an unusual step considering he left office 81 years
ago.</LD>
<LD>   Entering the presidential library business at this stage could be
a major task. The National Archives' Presidential Library System
covers presidents only since Herbert Hoover, meaning that Wilson's
library will remain largely on its own.</LD>
<TE>   The museum hasn't begun raising the $10 million to $20 million for
construction on the project, and museum officials are banking on a
major federal grant.</TE>
<TE>   "No question, the libraries that do best are the ones where the
president is still living. They're almost like English nobility: If a
former president writes you and asks you to donate a few thousand
dollars, you're more likely to respond," said Timothy Walch, director
of the Herbert Hoover Presidential Library and Museum in West Branch,
Iowa. "Those of us with presidents who are long passed from the scene
must rely on the good will of our communities."</TE>
<TE>   The presidential library system was created in the 1930s as a way
to provide public access to the papers, records and other historical
materials of U.S. presidents. Many collections from presidents who
served before the 1930s are in the Library of Congress, while others
are split among libraries, historical societies and private
collections.</TE>
<TE>   Presidential libraries have become increasingly more elaborate and
expensive in recent years. For example, former President Clinton's is
a $200-million project that includes 100 million documents.</TE>
<TE>   Don Wilson, chairman of the Woodrow Wilson Library planning
committee, believes that curiosity about the former president is
keen. Wilson served two terms from 1913-21, leading the nation during
World War I. He died in 1924.</TE>
<TE>   "There's a lot of interest in Woodrow Wilson out there that we can
tap into," said Wilson, who is no relation. "His internationalist
message has never been more important."</TE>
<TE>   Nestled in the 19th-century part of the city, the house where
Woodrow Wilson was born remains the nicest on the block. .</TE>
<TE>   The presidential library would be built in the same neighborhood.
It would house originals and copies of every document that Wilson
penned from his years at Princeton to the presidency to his
retirement in Washington, D.C.</TE>
<TE>   Wilson's father, Joseph, was pastor of the Presbyterian church in
Staunton when his son was born in 1856. But the Wilsons moved to
Augusta, Ga., the next year and then to South Carolina as the elder
Wilson became a professor at Columbia Theological Seminary.</TE>
<TE>   Woodrow Wilson returned only briefly in 1879 when he attended law
school at the University of Virginia and again while president to
spend a night at the house.</TE>
<TE>   But Patrick Clarke, executive director of the Woodrow Wilson
Birthplace Museum, said Wilson always considered Virginia to be his
home. "This is where his roots are," Clarke said.</TE>
<TE>   After he died, wife Edith Wilson asked that the house be turned
into a museum.</TE>
<TE>   Plans for the library have just begun. So far, the foundation has
hired an architectural firm and raised $400,000 for the estimated
$800,000 it will cost to design it.</TE>

<HD>Baugh Still Slings It in Texas</HD>
<DH>Football: Redskin Hall of Famer will talk up a storm when
he's not watching Western movies or football the entire day.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN McFARLAND</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>ROTAN, Texas</DL>
<LD>After spitting a load of tobacco juice into a well-worn cup, Sammy
Baugh lets out a hearty, toothless laugh, then shoots down the famous
tale about his pinpoint accuracy.</LD>
<LD>   According to the story, Baugh was at a practice with the
Washington Redskins in his rookie year when a coach told him to aim a
pass at a downfield receiver's eye. Baugh looked calmly at the coach
and asked, "Which eye?"</LD>
<LD>   "It's one of those things I think just gets started some way,"
said the West Texas country boy whose 88 years on the range were
briefly interrupted by one of the greatest careers in NFL history.</LD>
<TE>   Hyperbolic stories aren't needed to describe Baugh's versatile
career. His accomplishments from all over the field are even more
amazing in an era of NFL specialization.</TE>
<TE>   In 1943, Baugh led the league in passing, interceptions and
punting.</TE>
<TE>   In one game, he threw four touchdown passes and intercepted four.
He threw six touchdowns in a game--twice--and had an 85-yard punt.</TE>
<TE>   Baugh guided the Redskins to five title games and two
championships, playing his entire 16-year career without a face mask.
His No. 33 is the only jersey Washington has retired.</TE>
<TE>   The last surviving member of the Pro Football Hall of Fame's
inaugural class, Baugh still owns league marks for career punting
average (45.1 yards) and season average (51.4).</TE>
<TE>   "It's pretty safe that all the things he did will never be done
again," said Indianapolis Colts quarterback Peyton Manning, who spent
a day with Baugh a few years ago and has stayed in touch with him
since.</TE>
<TE>   Nowadays, Baugh rarely strays from his 7,600-acre ranch located
about 95 miles southeast of Lubbock. The Hall of Fame and the
Redskins have tried to lure him east for ceremonies over the years,
and he always turns them down.</TE>
<TE>   He likes the slow pace of his secluded life, but also still enjoys
talking football and golf with buddies who call or with an occasional
visitor.</TE>
<TE>   A creature of habit, Baugh watches as many Western movies as he
can and always eats a peanut butter and jelly sandwich for lunch. He
used to drive to the town of Snyder three or four times a week for
golf, until sore knees, searing heat and the 100-mile round trip made
those outings too tough.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't do much anymore. If I don't get back to golf, then hell,
I'll be home all the time," said Baugh, who seasons most sentences
with "hell," "damn" or both.</TE>
<TE>   But he still looks forward to football season.</TE>
<TE>   "I'll watch it all damn day long," Baugh said. "I like the
football they play. They got bigger boys, and they've also got these
damn speed merchants that we didn't have in those days. I'd love to
be quarterback this day and time."</TE>
<TE>   He especially likes watching the Colts and Manning. They met in
1999 when Sports Illustrated flew Manning to West Texas for a photo
shoot featuring stars from different eras.</TE>
<TE>   Manning, one of the few modern players who is also a fan, gets a
kick out of their occasional conversations, which are mostly about
football and golf.</TE>
<TE>   "He still talks like he's 25 or 30 years old," Manning said. "He
truly says what's on his mind and how he feels."</TE>
<TE>   Baugh appears to be in good shape. There was a bounce in his step
as he walked into the dining room of his modest house, and his
movements were quick as he scooped up his beloved dog Pee-Wee.</TE>
<TE>   Baugh's reputation began as a star high school football, baseball
and basketball player in Sweetwater. It grew during his college days
at TCU.</TE>
<TE>   It was there that he picked up the nickname "Slingin' Sammy"--but
it wasn't for his passing. It was for the hard throws to first base
as a shortstop and third baseman.</TE>
<TE>   "Everybody thought I was a better baseball player growing up," he
said. "I thought I was going to be a big-league baseball player."</TE>
<TE>   As an All-American football player, he led TCU to a 29-7-3 mark,
including victories in the Sugar and Cotton bowls.</TE>
<TE>   He masterfully executed an early version of the West Coast offense
at TCU, and he credits Horned Frog coach Dutch Meyer with his NFL
success.</TE>
<TE>   "I was a little ahead of a lot of football players in those days
because of Dutch," he said.</TE>
<TE>   When Baugh entered the NFL, the forward pass was so rare that it
was used mostly in desperate situations. But Baugh passed any time.</TE>
<TE>   "He was amazing, just tremendously accurate," said Eddie LeBaron,
who took over as Washington's quarterback in Baugh's last season. "He
could always find a way to throw it off-balance. I've seen him throw
the ball overarm, sidearm and underarm and complete them."</TE>
<TE>   As a rookie in 1937, Baugh completed a record 81 passes (about
seven a game) and led the league with 1,127 yards. Kurt Warner does
that in about three games, but Baugh's numbers were gaudy then. Only
six passers averaged three completions a game that year.</TE>
<TE>   He went on to lead the league in passing six times. He still holds
Redskins records for career touchdown passes (187) and completion
percentage in a season (70.3). His 31 interceptions are third on the
team's all-time list.</TE>
<TE>   "There's nobody any better than Sam Baugh was in pro football,"
said Don Maynard, a Hall of Fame receiver who grew up following the
fellow West Texan's career, then was coached by Baugh with the New
York Titans in 1960-61.</TE>
<TE>   "When I see somebody picking the greatest player around, to me, if
they didn't go both ways, they don't really deserve to be nominated.
I always ask, 'Well, how'd he do on defense? How was his punting?' "</TE>
<TE>   Even with all his success with the Redskins, Baugh's goal every
fall was to get back to the ranch.</TE>
<TE>   "I was always so damn glad to get out of Washington," he said. "I
enjoyed those years, but I always got out of there as fast as I
could. I don't like any damn city, and that's all there is to it. I
don't enjoy it one bit."</TE>
<TE>   He bought the Double Mountain Ranch, named for two hills that jut
out of the flat earth north of his house, in 1941. He and his wife,
Edmonia, who died in 1990, raised five children on the arid expanse
covered with mesquite trees, prickly pear cactus and about 500 cows.</TE>
<TE>   He came to the ranch full time in the mid-1960s, after several
coaching stops.</TE>
<TE>   "I felt like I was giving up something I really liked, not being
able to stay out here on this ranch and ride horses and tend cattle
and stuff like that," Baugh said. "That, to me, was the best part of
my life. I look back at it now and I'd give anything to do what I
used to do."</TE>
<TE>   Baugh pauses, then laughs.</TE>
<TE>   "Of course, without the football, there wouldn't be the ranch."</TE>

<LD>David Carr threw his first passes to his father, Rodger, inside their
California home. The broken furniture was proof the tosses weren't
all completed.</LD>
<LD>   Father and son eventually took their game of catch to the

his arm helped him make it to the NFL as the No. 1 draft pick of the
expansion Houston Texans.</LD>
<LD>   "When David could first sit up, I put a football in his hands,"
his father said. "We just always threw the football together. He
seemed to always say, 'Let's throw the football Dad,' and I said,
'Let's go.' "</LD>
<TE>   David was still in junior high school when Rodger Carr realized
his son was more talented than other kids. Not only was he
out-throwing high schoolers at the park, he was completing 85 percent
of his passes in games.</TE>
<TE>   But Carr wasn't exactly a prodigy. He started only two seasons in
high school, then hardly played his first two years at Fresno State.
Coach Pat Hill stunned Carr by suggesting he redshirt in his third
year.</TE>
<TE>   "I knew what I had to do on the field, it was more the off-field
stuff," Carr said. "It was typical growing up stuff. I wasn't sure
that I wanted to be there."</TE>
<TE>   The problem was his girlfriend, Melody, who was back home in
Bakersfield. Carr had trouble concentrating on his studies, and he
fell into some sloppy habits.</TE>
<TE>   But then they got married, and he became a starter his junior
year.</TE>
<TE>   After throwing four interceptions in his first start against Ohio
State, Carr threw only eight more in 2000. The Bulldogs went 7-5 and
Carr threw for 2,338 yards and 18 touchdowns.</TE>
<TE>   The hype took off last season with Carr on the preseason lists for
all kinds of awards. He led the Bulldogs to an 11-2 record, with
upsets of Colorado and Wisconsin, peaking at No. 8 in the poll.</TE>
<TE>   Carr didn't quite match his junior high completion percentage, but
he did complete 63 percent and led the nation with 4,308 yards
passing. He also had 42 touchdown passes and only seven
interceptions.</TE>
<TE>   That earned Carr the Johnny Unitas, Sammy Baugh and Pop Warner
awards. He was the sixth college quarterback to throw for at least
4,000 yards and 40 touchdowns in a season.</TE>
<TE>   The Texans were on to Carr for a long time. Although not sure they
wanted to pick a quarterback No. 1, the 6-foot-3, 230-pound Carr's
ability and demeanor convinced the Texans he was worth it.</TE>
<TE>   "When we identified his skill being worthy of the No. 1 pick, we
did a lot of psychological testing," offensive coordinator Chris
Palmer said. "We asked, 'How would you feel about being the first
player selected?' 'How would you handle it if you had to sit out for
a year?' 'How would you handle it if you were pulled out of a game?'</TE>
<TE>   "He passed all the tests with flying colors."</TE>
<TE>   Coach Dom Capers wanted to know whom Carr resembled.</TE>
<TE>   "I told Dom he reminded me of [Brett] Favre with his arm strength
and how he throws to different spots at the college level," Palmer
said.</TE>
<TE>   Although there was some debate whether Carr or Oregon quarterback
Joey Harrington was the better quarterback, the issue was settled
with the Texans. Carr was their man.</TE>
<TE>   They made their decision two weeks before the draft. Carr moved to
Houston, bought a home and became a millionaire, signing a seven-year
contact worth $47 million. It could go up to $60 million if he
reaches all his incentive clauses.</TE>
<TE>   Many expect to see a long and luminous pro career for the one-time
furniture wrecker. His fans include five-time Pro Bowl lineman Tony
Boselli, probably the second-most glittering name on the Texans
behind Carr.</TE>
<TE>   "The athletic ability he has is what has stood out," Boselli said.
"He's made a couple of plays in training camp that the guys will just
stand and look at and shake their heads at his arm strength and the
way he moves around.</TE>
<TE>   "He knows what's ahead of him. He'll have some ups and downs, but
he stays on even keel. I think he'll be great."</TE>
<TE>   Carr's biggest fan in the NFL is Seattle's Trent Dilfer, another
former Fresno State quarterback.</TE>
<TE>   Dilfer never reached his promise as the sixth player taken in the
1993 draft by Tampa Bay. After the Bucs released him, he joined the
Ravens and guided them to the 2000 NFL title.</TE>
<TE>   "Our situations were very similar, and because of that, I tried to
help him not make some of the same mistakes that I made," Dilfer
said. "He can learn some things from me, but other things he's got to
learn from himself. I think he's going to be a great quarterback, one
of the fine ones in our game in the next 10 years."</TE>
<TE>   Kerry Collins was Capers' rookie quarterback with the expansion
Carolina Panthers in 1995. His advice: "Weather the bad times, learn
from the bad times and learn from the good times."</TE>
<TE>   "It's a constant learning process," said Collins, now with the
Giants. "He's in for an interesting ride, I'll say that. It's a lot
of fun sometimes, and sometimes it's not fun."</TE>
<TE>   The Texans signed 11-year veteran Kent Graham to start until Carr
could take charge. But Carr has been the starter from Day 1.</TE>
<TE>   In his first two preseason games, Carr completed 18 of 31 passes
for 191 yards. He's thrown his first interception and received his
first sack.</TE>
<TE>   "He's shown the ability to avoid pressure," Capers said. "He can
improvise sometimes and make plays when they aren't there."</TE>
<TE>   A sidearm delivery that raised questions before the draft hasn't
been a problem with Palmer.</TE>
<TE>   "His release point in college was not the same because, with his
great talent, he took some liberties with his throws," Palmer said.
"Here, he's been pretty good. His mechanics have been very solid."</TE>
<TE>   Carr's composure under fire has impressed Capers.</TE>
<TE>   "The thing that David gives you is a chance to make a big play at
any point and that's a good place to start," Capers said. "He's
continued to progress with an understanding of what we can and can't
do versus certain defensive schemes."</TE>
<TE>   Carr still remembers the games of catch that launched his career.
He even has the brown football he and his dad used to throw around.
No matter how tired he is when he comes home, he's always willing to
pull out that battered ball and toss it around with his 2-year-old
son, Austin.</TE>
<TE>   Soon, Melody will insist they take their game outside.</TE>

<HD>A Baseball Strike Could End Pastime</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TONY KORNHEISER</AU>
<BD>WASHINGTON POST</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>What if this time it isn't "three strikes and you're out" in
baseball?</LD>
<LD>   What if this time it's two strikes--1994 and 2002?</LD>
<LD>   When George W. Bush said Friday he'd be "furious" if a strike shut
down baseball, that was the sound of one shoe dropping. The other
shoe carries the sound of baseball's once loud footsteps fading away
into oblivion.</LD>
<TE>   If there is a strike, and it washes out the playoffs and World
Series like it did in 1994, baseball as we've known it will come to
rest on the side of the road like a punctured tire.</TE>
<TE>   Baseball was lucky to come back whole from the 1994 strike. It
happened because of a serendipitous combination of circumstances.
First, there was everybody's feel-good superstar, Cal Ripken, Jr.,
stalking the unimaginable, unapproachable record of consecutive games
set by Lou Gehrig. Ripken's ascension up this Everest paid tribute to
the everyday, workmanlike aspect of baseball; it was a character
reference for the man and the game. You couldn't help but respond
positively to Ripken--especially when night after night he stayed
late at the park to sign autographs for free.</TE>
<TE>   A few years after that Mark McGwire and Sammy Sosa thrilled the
country as they went after the biggest number in the Game of Numbers,
61. Sosa's famous laughter and his obvious joy humanized
McGwire--until ultimately, at No. 62, McGwire landed on home plate
and picked up his son and hugged him, showing the world that he was
not just a superman athlete, but a father. Was there ever a symbol of
the righteousness of baseball as powerful as that?</TE>
<TE>   Finally, last year, there was a Fall Classic for the ages, going
down to the last inning of the seventh game. The drama was made even
more powerful by coming so closely after Sept. 11. Again, the
symbolism was rich. The familiar pomp and ceremony of the nation's
pastime had helped in the nation's recovery, and fittingly one of the
teams in the World Series was the Yankees of New York, the city that
had been hit the hardest.</TE>
<TE>   None of those things are in play now. Ripken is retired, and there
is no current baseball player who we think of as a salt of the earth.
McGwire's 70 was passed before we even got to know it. Even if Barry
Bonds or Sammy Sosa hits 80, this year's steroid stories have made us
view home runs with skepticism, not honest awe. (The feeling is so
pervasive that the players pledged pre-emptively to submit to steroid
testing). And on Sept. 11, if there is a strike, baseball will be
seen as disgracing the memory of the day--everybody else will be
pulling together, and the players and owners will be pulling apart.</TE>
<TE>   If it took baseball seven years to recover from the last strike,
it might take 17 to recover from this one. Or 27. Or forever.
Baseball has already lost much of its audience to other sports.
Sometimes it seems young people only go to games when their fathers
drag them. Baseball is harder to learn than basketball and football;
it's slow as molasses compared to the X games. You can't play
baseball one-on-one or three-on-three or five-on-five. Baseball
requires more patience, more commitment, more love. Football, with
its crash-bam syncopation, long ago left baseball behind.</TE>
<TE>   Which gives me a chance to shoehorn in this Redskins interlude:</TE>
<TE>   Thank God he got to the Redskins. I was beginning to worry he'd
forgotten Steve Spurrier was more important to this city than 1,000
dopey baseball players.</TE>
<TE>   You know those prescription drug commercials, where they tell you
that just one pill a day will rid all your allergies forever. And the
sun's shining, the dogs are romping, the kids are playing and
everybody's having a great time. And then, right at the end of the
commercial, in a very rapid-fire manner the announcer comes on, and
rattles off a few possible side-effects, like nausea, dry mouth,
spontaneous bleeding from the gums and: " ... may cause hair to
sprout from your ears." You know, minor stuff like that.</TE>
<TE>   OK, here is the pill we have, and it's a cure for everything that
ails you: The Redskins have scored 75 points in two games. They
rolled 38 on the 49ers, and 37 on the Panthers. They are out of the
gate like Secretariat.</TE>
<TE>   Sadly, these points don't count. These aren't real games.</TE>
<TE>   Here is the warning, complete with the possible side-effects:
Nobody has shown Steve Spurrier anything close to the defenses he
might see in the regular season. Wait until the Mariuccis, the
Hasletts, the Fassels and the Reids start bringing real bodies in
waves at the Redskins. Complicated NFL blitz packages could result in
severe damage to the quarterbacks. Didn't you ever wonder why
Spurrier wants to carry four quarterbacks? He would carry eight if he
could--because he knows at least two of them are going to be carted
off the field during every game. It's going to look like "Gladiator"
out there.</TE>
<TE>   I'm on the record suggesting the reason Danny Wuerffel and Shane
Matthews never lit up the NFL is because they haven't found a system
they can excel in, like they had in Florida under Spurrier. I'm on
the record suggesting that being reunited with Spurrier might give
them the comfort and confidence to max out with the Redskins. And I
believe that. I also believe that when the blitzes come, these two
could be shish-kabob.</TE>
<TE>   OK, thanks for your indulgence. I just needed to cover my behind
in case the Redskins get bopped tonight by the Steelers. Now back to
baseball.</TE>
<TE>   There's not much more to say about the possible strike. I
understand the players believe they've given on a lot of issues
already--especially by agreeing to permit a luxury tax. So if the
players do strike they will claim the owners forced them into it.</TE>
<TE>   But what is this strike about? The average salary in baseball is
$2.4 million. Most of the veterans who are any good make $4 million
or more. A luxury tax won't roll back salaries; it will simply
prevent an escalation of those preposterous $25 million a year A-Rod
contracts. This is worth striking over? Did I miss something that
happened in the last half hour that makes it impossible to live on $4
million a year?</TE>
<TE>   Baseball is the goose that lays golden eggs.</TE>
<TE>   Only fools would strike. Only fools.</TE>

<HD>Still a Big Man on Campus</HD>
<DH>College football: Maryland coach has dropped 40 pounds
after leading Terrapins to their first bowl game in 25 years.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID GINSBURG</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>COLLEGE PARK, Md.</DL>
<LD>At 315 pounds and just eight months removed from leading Maryland to
its first major bowl bid in 25 years, Ralph Friedgen is the
quintessential big man on campus.</LD>
<LD>   "It's been almost humbling. I'm so appreciative of the warmth," he
says. "I can't go into a store, or anywhere, where people don't
congratulate me and our team on last season. It was a long time ago,
and they are still talking about it."</LD>
<LD>   His popularity hasn't waned, but his waistline sure has. Thanks to
a diet that has enabled him to shed 40 pounds since April 1, the man
affectionately known as "Fridge" may soon have to get a new nickname.</LD>
<TE>   Mini Fridge? Ice Chest?</TE>
<TE>   "Call me whatever you want. I won't care," he says.</TE>
<TE>   It's a bit too early to call him "Slim," but Friedgen certainly
does look better. The crash diet is the result of his unyielding
quest to make Maryland a perennial football powerhouse.</TE>
<TE>   Friedgen carried 355 pounds last year as he huffed and puffed his
way through a 10-2 season in his head coaching debut.</TE>
<TE>   He made it big all right, but it was also apparent that the coach
was also far too large for his own good.</TE>
<TE>   Friedgen shunned suggestions of a diet, but finally came across an
offer too good to refuse: Two concerned boosters promised to donate
$500 to the football program for every pound he lost. Eager to
refurbish the team house, Friedgen has targeted the two big spenders
to foot a sizable chunk of the bill.</TE>
<TE>   "They came up with the proposition. I'm a competitor and I like
goals," Friedgen says.</TE>
<TE>   His objective: lose 100 pounds by next April. His pursuit has
become so noteworthy that when Friedgen recently visited the White
House, the first thing President Bush asked him was how his diet was
going.</TE>
<TE>   "I never expected it to turn into what it did, with everyone
talking about my waistline, but I'm trying to get this building
built," Friedgen says. "I'm going to do everything I can to get this
place where it needs to be."</TE>
<TE>   And he's doing whatever it takes to get his weight down. Friedgen
claims he hasn't had pizza, beer, ice cream or potatoes since he
started the diet. At media day last week, the coach ate salad while
reporters wolfed down pizza and subs.</TE>
<TE>   "I've eaten so much rabbit food, my ears are getting longer,"
Friedgen jokes. "You know, I was a happy fat guy."</TE>
<TE>   There wasn't much reason to be anything but happy last year, when
Friedgen turned a perennial loser into Atlantic Coast Conference
champions. The Terrapins' 56-23 loss to Florida in the Orange Bowl
did little to detract from the team's heady and unexpected success.</TE>
<TE>   Friedgen faces the task of coming up with a suitable encore. The
season opener against Notre Dame is just two weeks away, but the
coach isn't sure who will start at quarterback, running back or
middle linebacker.</TE>
<TE>   It's enough to make a guy drop a few pounds without even trying.</TE>
<TE>   "We've got a lot of work to do, a lot of questions to answer.
There are a lot of holes in this program," Friedgen said. "But the
one thing we have this year that we didn't have last year is the
belief that we can win."</TE>
<TE>   Friedgen still sounds the same on the practice field. He doesn't
tolerate mistakes, and his booming voice hasn't lost any of its
authority.</TE>
<TE>   "There might be physical change, but his personality and energy
hasn't changed at all," linebacker E. J. Henderson says.</TE>
<TE>   A year ago, carrying around all that weight caused Friedgen's legs
to swell from edema. That's not a problem anymore, and he's bouncing
from one group to another during drills.</TE>
<TE>   "The weight loss probably has him running around more. The
yelling, of course, is the same," punter Brooks Barnard said. "The
attitude and intensity is still there -- if not more so."</TE>

<HD>Disease Can't Match Drive in Cody Unser's Mission</HD>
<DH>Daughter of Al Unser Jr. has rare spinal cord disease that
has left her partially paralyzed, but she's battling the affliction
with heart of a champion.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PETE HERRERA</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>CORRALES, N.M.</DL>
<LD>She has met Prince Andrew, lobbied President Bush and partied with
actor Christopher Reeve.</LD>
<LD>   But what really gets 15-year-old Cody Unser's adrenaline going
these days is getting behind the wheel of a fast car.</LD>
<LD>   "Freedom!" exclaimed the daughter of race car driver Al Unser Jr.
"When I get in the driver's seat, I feel I have total control of
everything. It's a real privilege."</LD>
<TE>   And another conquest for this atypical teenager.</TE>
<TE>   For three years, Cody has been confined to a wheelchair, paralyzed
from the chest down by transverse myelitis, a rare spinal cord
disease that afflicts 34,000 people in the United States. It has
turned her into a relentless crusader--for a normal life and a cure.</TE>
<TE>   The high school sophomore got her driving permit this summer. She
uses hand controls to drive--one attached to the brakes, another to
the accelerator.</TE>
<TE>   "She's good," said Albert, her 19-year-old brother and driving
mentor. "She took over the (driving school) range course. Parallel
parking, driving through cones, she was the lead car."</TE>
<TE>   "She's been driving around with her brother and anybody that will
let her," said her mom, Shelley Unser.</TE>
<TE>   Cody also is a certified scuba diver and has vowed to walk again
and dance at her high school prom her senior year.</TE>
<TE>   "If anybody can do it, she can," said Doug Kerr, her doctor and
the director of the Transverse Myelitis Center at Johns Hopkins in
Baltimore. "Cody is someone who has done extraordinary things in
spite of and maybe because of her disability."</TE>
<TE>   Kerr said Cody's condition has improved slightly. About a third of
the individuals stricken with transverse myelitis fully recover
within the first three months.</TE>
<TE>   "She's in a holding period," Kerr said. "The level [of paralysis]
has decreased slightly. As the level lowers, it gives her a little
more trunk support and stability."</TE>
<TE>   While Cody Unser continues to battle the disease, her father has
had his own struggles. The two-time Indianapolis 500 winner was
arrested last month after his girlfriend said he hit her in the face
while drunk. No charges were filed, but Unser later entered a
substance-abuse center to get help for his drinking problem. He
finished fifth in the Belterra Casino Indy 300 on Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   Cody and her father have had very little contact since her parents
divorced in 1999. She last saw her dad about a year ago and does not
plan to contact him about his recent troubles.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it's going to take more than support for him to
straighten his life out," she said. "I wish him the best and I think
it will be good for him to face it by himself."</TE>
<TE>   Unser said he considers Cody's battle much tougher than his own.</TE>
<TE>   "Cody is climbing a way bigger mountain than I am," he said. "She
is a way bigger person than I am with far more courage than I have."</TE>
<TE>   Soon after being stricken, Cody and her mother created the Cody
Unser First Step Foundation to increase public awareness about TM.
They and Kerr also established a medical consortium to disseminate
information about the disease. The consortium, which gathers data
from TM patients, now includes several medical groups and institutes
nationwide.</TE>
<TE>   Shelley Unser said more than 100 TM patients attended a recent
meeting of the consortium in California.</TE>
<TE>   "There was one man there who said he's had TM for 35 years and had
never seen another person with that condition," she said.</TE>
<TE>   It's through the First Step Foundation that Cody had a chance to
cross paths with Reeve, Bush and other celebrities.</TE>
<TE>   She was part of the welcoming party when Bush visited Albuquerque
last year to talk about stem cell research. He has supported giving
federal funding for limited embryonic stem cell research.</TE>
<TE>   Reeve, who has been paralyzed since falling from a horse seven
years ago, invited Cody to his birthday party last year. She met
Prince Andrew when he was at a medical center in California looking
into the latest wheelchair technology.</TE>
<TE>   "I got to tell him a little about my story and how much freedom my
wheelchair has given me," she said.</TE>
<TE>   On Sept. 7, rock singer and Showtime comedy series host Chris
Isaak will perform a benefit concert in Albuquerque for the
foundation as part of the second annual Cody Unser Celebrity Golf
Fiesta.</TE>
<TE>   Unser has become a polished speaker as she spreads the word about
transverse myelitis. This summer, she spoke to 7,000 insurance
professionals at the Prudential company's national conference in
Vancouver.</TE>
<TE>   Unser also is helping teach other paralyzed individuals to scuba
dive. Working with the New Mexico Scuba Center in Albuquerque, 10
have learned to dive and are headed to the Cayman Islands this month.</TE>
<TE>   "She has changed people's lives, opened people's eyes," Kerr said.
"She's changed how thousands of people think about transverse
myelitis and disability in general."</TE>
<TE>   Cody has learned to cope with her condition and to appreciate what
she is able to do.</TE>
<TE>   "I do get down and depressed every now and then," she said. Then,
repeating one of her favorite speaking tour kickers, she adds, "but
in order to understand what's sweet, you have to taste the sour."</TE>

<HD>Drought Spells Trouble for Much of U.S.</HD>
<DH>Weather: A prolonged dry spell is wreaking economic and
environmental havoc.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PAULINE ARRILLAGA</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS WRITER</BD>
<DL>PINE, Ariz.</DL>
<LD>It's been a slow summer in this mountain hamlet that takes its name
from the trees that surround town. The arts and crafts fair was
canceled, along with the July 4 fireworks. The antique market was
pushed back to October, as was this month's Heritage Day celebration.</LD>
<LD>   Attendance was low at the quilt show. Tables were empty at the
Randall House restaurant. And the OK Corral had to shut down
altogether, its trail rides scrapped during the height of the season.</LD>
<LD>   In a place dependent upon summer tourism for economic survival,
there's plenty of blame to go around. Most of the nearby national
forest was closed for two months. A giant wildfire that burned for
weeks to the east turned away even more visitors.</LD>
<TE>   Then, in July, the unthinkable: In much of Pine, the faucets ran
dry -- forcing organizers to postpone the biggest functions of the
year over fears that there wouldn't be enough water.</TE>
<TE>   "It's kind of a sequence of events," said Randall House owner
Barbara Frazin-O'Connor, whose business is down 35%.</TE>
<TE>   The sequence of events is linked to one disastrous source: the
drought.</TE>
<TE>   From quaint mountain towns to cattle ranches and even the downtown
streets of big cities, a dry spell that for some states rivals the
most severe on record is wreaking economic and environmental havoc on
much of the nation.</TE>
<TE>   More than one-third of the 48 contiguous U.S. states is now in
severe to extreme drought, while more than half of the country is
experiencing at least moderate drought conditions, experts say. The
problem is most acute in the West, where every state but Washington
is in some stage of drought.</TE>
<TE>   Overall, the dry spell isn't as prolonged or widespread as
droughts of the 1930s and '50s. But the drought of 2002 may well go
down in history as one of the most far-reaching in impact, thanks to
growth spurts that have increased competition for what little water
there is.</TE>
<TE>   "We have more people and more development in areas that we weren't
in before. Whether it be golf courses or grass yards ... that use of
water is straining a finite resource," said Mark Svoboda,
climatologist at the National Drought Mitigation Center at the
University of Nebraska.</TE>
<TE>   "Maybe it doesn't take a drought that's historic to see the
impacts we're seeing now. They are indeed severe. We are more
vulnerable."</TE>
<TE>   Ranchers are selling off herds. Fishing and hunting guides are
losing clients. Homeowners face fines if they soak gardens on the
wrong day.</TE>
<TE>   Some residents have run out of water completely, their towns
forced to haul it in for the most mundane of tasks -- taking a
shower, flushing the toilet.</TE>
<TE>   In the West, the drought turned a typical fire season treacherous,
helping to spark more blazes that rapidly spread out of control.</TE>
<TE>   National forests closed their gates over fears that a campfire
would ignite browning trees and brush.</TE>
<TE>   Even wildlife and insects are feeling the effects. Thousands of
animals have flocked from forests to suburbs in search of food.
Antelope fawns are dying. The Colorado state bird -- the lark bunting
-- is almost nonexistent in its home state, driven out by dwindling
food and water supplies.</TE>
<TE>   In Nebraska, the opposite problem: a drought-induced infestation
of grasshoppers and crickets is ravaging crops.</TE>
<TE>   Throughout the country, losses are still being calculated. But in
Nebraska, the total economic effect of the drought is at least $1.4
billion. In Colorado, farmers will lose an estimated $100 million on
the winter wheat crop. In Arizona, officials predict $300 million in
losses in the livestock industry alone.</TE>
<TE>   "It hurts everybody," said Arizona businessman John Williams,
whose trail ride operation lost $30,000 when Coconino National Forest
shut down this summer.</TE>
<TE>   Drought occurs somewhere in the United States every year,
according to the Drought Mitigation Center. What changes is how
severe, widespread and prolonged those spells are. At the height of
the eight-year Dust Bowl, 65% of the country was in severe to extreme
drought. The annual average is 15%.</TE>
<TE>   The current drought coincides with the transition in 1998 from an
El Nino to a La Nina weather pattern. El Nino, characterized by
warmer-than-usual seas, generally brings more precipitation to the
southern tier of the country. La Nina produces the opposite effect --
cooler seas and dry conditions.</TE>
<TE>   In some parts of the Southeast, where drought is ravaging towns
from central Georgia through the middle of South and North Carolina
and into central Virginia, rainfall is 60 inches below normal.</TE>
<TE>   In the Southwest, it's a similar story. Precipitation was 45% of
normal through June in New Mexico, making this the eighth-driest year
since 1895. Arizona received less than an inch of rain in the same
period, compared with an average 4.6 inches.</TE>
<TE>   The desert is so dry that cracks up to 6 feet wide have formed on
parched land.</TE>
<TE>   In Colorado, snowpacks were 60% of average this year. That meant
less runoff into the two main storage reservoirs for the Colorado
River Basin, which supplies water to seven Western states.</TE>
<TE>   Lake Powell, on the Arizona-Utah line, stands at 63% of capacity,
while Nevada's Lake Mead is 67% full and could hit a 30-year low
later this year.</TE>
<TE>   Denver imposed mandatory watering restrictions for the first time
since 1981, although in other cities, such as Phoenix, there are
none.</TE>
<TE>   "Basically, the country's brown," said fishing guide Larry Stiefel
of Buena Vista, Colo., southwest of Denver.</TE>
<TE>   Stiefel loses one of his watering holes this month when Denver
water officials drain Antero Reservoir to fill a deeper storage site
and reduce the risk of evaporation.</TE>
<TE>   "It's going to take a while to recover from all this."</TE>
<TE>   Forecasters hope that the summer rains bring some immediate
relief, although the eastern hurricane season and western monsoons
have yet to produce any major storms.</TE>
<TE>   In the long term, experts are looking again to El Nino but aren't
sure whether one now developing will be strong enough to bust the
drought.</TE>
<TE>   In places like Pine, fingers are crossed that rain will return.</TE>
<TE>   Melvin Van Vorst, head of the Pine-Strawberry Historical Society,
hopes that the business community recoups some of its summer losses
this fall when the town belatedly holds its big events. Even his
organization lost one-third of its budget when it had to postpone the
antique show.</TE>
<TE>   But one look around at this town's normally spectacular
surroundings could shake his faith. Mountain vistas that should be
carpeted in green are brown and barren.</TE>
<TE>   Even the pines around Pine have withered.</TE>
<TE>   "It's always reminded me of the Great Smoky Mountains," Van Vorst
said. "When you look at the woods and the forest and the mountains,
and you can see dirt.... This year, it looks like the desert it is."</TE>

<HD>Idaho's Dugout Dick Is Fading Into History</HD>
<DH>Lifestyle: The hermit has spent 54 years in a succession of
caves, tending his goats and garden. But his 86 years are catching up
to him.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TIM WOODWARD</AU>
<BD>THE IDAHO STATESMAN</BD>
<DL>ELK BEND, Idaho</DL>
<LD>The stream of songs and poems penned in a cave above the Salmon River
has slowed to a trickle. The guitar is silent, the picks and shovels
idle.</LD>
<LD>   Time is catching up with Dugout Dick. The "Salmon River Caveman"
is 86 and, in his words, "too laid up to do much."</LD>
<LD>   For most of his many years, Richard Zimmerman lived life alone and
on his own terms. He rode freight trains with railroad tramps, herded
sheep, dug for precious metals.</LD>
<TE>   He was digging on a mountainside near Elk Bend, south of Salmon,
when he had the idea of digging a home.</TE>
<TE>   A cave was perfect for him, providing shelter and the independence
he craved. One cave led to another, and the legend of Dugout Dick the
Salmon River Caveman was born.</TE>
<TE>   For 54 years, he's lived in his caves, tended his goats and his
garden, and delighted followers of the state's mountain solitaries.</TE>
<TE>   Once part of the fabric of life in Idaho, the hermits who lent
their unique character to its river canyons and ridge tops are fading
into history. Buckskin Bill, Free Press Frances and the others are
gone. Dugout Dick may be the last, and even legends get old.</TE>
<TE>   "I broke my hip two years ago and spent 17 days in a hospital in
Idaho Falls," he said. "It's the longest I've ever been away from the
river.</TE>
<TE>   "I walk with a cane now, and my fingers are too stiff to play the
guitar. I haven't been able to make any caves for a long time."</TE>
<TE>   Then he brightens, says he "can still make music" and pulls a
harmonica from a weathered box. His feet tap the floor of the cave;
the rock walls ring with the strains of "Wabash Cannonball."</TE>
<TE>   He plays and sings three lively verses, then stops abruptly.</TE>
<TE>   "I better quit now," he says. "I'm getting my breakfast in my
harp."</TE>
<TE>   Even at 86, there's no one quite like Dugout Dick.</TE>
<TE>   He came to the canyon to leave the world of people. An unhappy
home life in Indiana left a lasting mark.</TE>
<TE>   He's turned down offers to appear as a guest on "The Tonight
Show." He's been featured in National Geographic magazine and on
"Good Morning, America." His summer visitors this year have included
television crews from as far away as Germany.</TE>
<TE>   "I ain't no hermit now," he said.</TE>
<TE>   He feels obligated to stick around for the visitors who rent his
caves--he has 14--for $5 a night or $25 a month. Others pay him
gratuities for cave tours, photos, sketches and autographs.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm in the tourist business," he said. "I made $40 the other day.
And the Army's started sending me money every month. I'm livin' high
on the hog now."</TE>
<TE>   His hip injury and World War II service made him eligible for a
veterans disability pension. He's using the money to pay his hospital
bills.</TE>
<TE>   And after decades of living alone, his solitary status is in
danger. The caveman has a bank account in Salmon.</TE>
<TE>   The Disabled American Veterans recently made him a lifetime
member, the Bureau of Land Management brings him firewood and his
neighbors across the river take e-mail messages for him and invite
him over on Sundays.</TE>
<TE>   "This Christmas, I looked out and saw him over there and wondered
what in the world he was doing for Christmas," neighbor Connie Fitte
said. "All his cave renters had left.</TE>
<TE>   "I went to town and bought him a shirt and helped him start a
fire. I could see he wasn't well. That night, my husband went over
and invited him to our house for the following Sunday. He had a bath,
and I cut his hair. He's been our Sunday visitor ever since. He's
like my adopted grandfather now."</TE>
<TE>   For his part, the "adopted grandfather" enjoys the visits. A
delicate stomach keeps him from the dinner table, but he appreciates
the company and the hot baths--a pleasant change from his usual
practice of bathing in a washtub or the river.</TE>
<TE>   When he isn't visiting, he's likely to be doing most of the things
he's always done. He just does them slower now.</TE>
<TE>   He rises with the sun and spends most days close to home,
puttering in his caves, visiting with renters and tourists, and
reading magazines and his Bible. When the spirit moves him, he writes
religious poems. Every other week, he writes a letter to his sister
in Indiana.</TE>
<TE>   Goats Are Gone</TE>
<TE>   His goats are gone. They had the disturbing habit of eating his
books and newspaper clippings. But he still harvests fruits and
vegetables from his one-acre orchard and garden.</TE>
<TE>   The garden is watered by a windmill he designed to draw water from
the river. Unable to eat meat, wheat or sugar, he lives mainly on
fresh and fermented vegetables, rye-flour mush, pork and beans,
yogurt and dried fruit.</TE>
<TE>   He still sings the old railroad songs, still makes his
stinging-nettle yogurt, still wears his ever-present hardhat.</TE>
<TE>   "You bump your head a lot when you live in a cave," he said.</TE>
<TE>   His caves are equipped with doors and windows--mostly old
windshields and meager furnishings.</TE>
<TE>   The one where he lives has carpet and linoleum, a woodstove,
tables and chairs, a tube that brings fresh water from a spring and a
solar collector to run his radio and a light in his bedroom.</TE>
<TE>   He dug the caves alone, using a pick, shovel and pry bar. He
hauled the supporting timbers in by horseback. He helped build the
access road, which was named after an aviation pioneer.</TE>
<TE>   Now there are days when it's all he can do to climb the hillside
with his cane.</TE>
<TE>   On winter days, he's been known to climb into his 1994 Chevy
pickup and just drive. It's his arthritis remedy.</TE>
<TE>   "The heat and the vibration of the gearshift against my knee," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   He half jokingly says he'll live a thousand years, then admits to
worrying about what will happen to his caves after he's gone.</TE>
<TE>   The BLM owns the land, and some of the locals have complained that
a hillside honeycombed with caves and strewn with junk is an eyesore
in need of bulldozing.</TE>
<TE>   Others--including its occupant--say the site should be preserved
as an Idaho landmark.</TE>
<TE>   "The road should be named Dugout Road," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "And the caves should be made into a memorial. As it is now, the
only memorial around here is me."</TE>

<DH>A project explores how a toy concept reflects women's place

<LD>Hello Kitty is waaaaay late.</LD>
<LD>   It's nearly 9 p.m., and she was supposed to be here an hour ago.
But, hey, it's Southern California, and she's apparently stuck in
traffic coming from Irvine.</LD>
<LD>   "She's on her way," mutters Jaime Scholnick, a visual artist who's
directing her dream project on digital video. It will be the
centerpiece of her fall show at POST Gallery, a show she's calling
"Hello Kitty Gets a Mouth."</LD>
<TE>   "In the meantime," Scholnick says with an air of distraction,
"we're shooting some of the other scenes."</TE>
<TE>   By nature an affable person, Scholnick tries to keep smiling, but
in fact she looks stressed. After all, Kitty--a.k.a. Junko Makuuchi,
a student at UC Irvine--is going back to Japan for her summer
holidays and won't be available after this week. And where would the
film be without its star?</TE>
<TE>   Everyone else is there--the cinematographer, the
co-cinematographer who tonight is doing lighting, the script
supervisor/assistant, plus two friends Scholnick has recruited to
play Japanese doctors whom Kitty consults.</TE>
<TE>   Everyone and a modicum of equipment--one camera on a tripod, one
floodlight and some cables--are crammed into a narrow hallway on the
third floor of American Intercontinental University in Marina del
Rey, where Scholnick's day job is teaching art theory and studio
classes.</TE>
<TE>   Since it's near the computer room, students keep stumbling by and
asking, "What's going on here?" One of them, a Japanese student, is
talked into playing a third doctor.</TE>
<TE>   In Scholnick's imaginative reinvention of Hello Kitty, the
mouthless cartoon feline and marketing phenom suddenly realizes that
she is incapable of making a sound--and is she frustrated! Watching
television and poring over women's magazines, Kitty finds a mouth she
likes and takes the illustration to three Tokyo plastic surgeons. One
by one, they refuse her. Standing in a corner, Nathan Wilson is
playing Dr. No. 2, wearing an officious white coat and vigorously
shaking his head at the camera. Two angles and half a dozen takes
later, he's done. He passes his white coat and stethoscope to Inmo,
an L.A. gallery owner who's playing Dr. Shibata.</TE>
<TE>   They're setting up Shibata's "office" in a small room off the
corridor. Inmo practices shaking his head and looking stern next to a
chart of various before-and-after shots of reconstructive
surgery--the approved ones for Westernized eyelids and enlarged
breasts.</TE>
<TE>   There's a commotion in the hall--the production's Hello Kitty has
arrived. Makuuchi, 24, looks like a teen and speaks in a soft voice,
which she now uses to apologize profusely for her lateness.</TE>
<TE>   A relieved Scholnick hurries her into the women's restroom to get
her into costume, a cartoon-cute ensemble of white satin blouse with
big rounded collar and pink pinafore. Scholnick talked a recent
American Intercontinental fashion grad, Belsie Galliano, into making
the dress, while Scholnick took on the task of fabricating the shoes
and the headpiece, a giant orb covered with white faux fur, with
trademark black ovals for eyes, a stubby yellow nose and ... no
mouth.</TE>
<TE>   During the costume change, Makuuchi confesses to Scholnick,
"Sorry, I forgot." Turns out that if Daniel Brodo, the
co-cinematographer, hadn't called when she was discovered missing,
Kitty would still be in Irvine.</TE>
<TE>   The Hello Kitty phenomenon hit Scholnick seven years ago. She was
31, with a master's of fine arts from Claremont Graduate University
when she went to Japan and began teaching English to adults in the
city of Yamagata. The irony is that she left the United States in
search of the sublime, inspired by a 1990 exhibition of contemporary
Japanese art at LACMA, "A Primal Spirit."</TE>
<TE>   "I thought there would be a connection between living there and
making that sort of work," she says. "So I went there, I tried to
make very beautiful work, but I was just bombarded with these social
issues."</TE>
<TE>   For one thing, she was shocked by the poor treatment of women--and
how they accepted their reduced status. "All my students--like
40-year-old women--would come in wearing Hello Kitty," Scholnick
recalls. "I finally asked a student one day, Why do you like her? And
she said, 'Oh, she's so kawaii, so cute.' " The student, around 35,
sported a Hello Kitty T-shirt and handbag, and Scholnick looked more
closely at the image: no mouth.</TE>
<TE>   "I was horrified. How could you like a character that doesn't even
have a mouth? I started using that character as emblematic of how I
felt there. You know, women have to be cute; you don't speak."</TE>
<TE>   Scholnick channeled her outrage into artwork. In 1997, she had a
one-woman show at Gallery Kobo Chika in Tokyo. The show's title,
"Kawaii/Kowai," was a play on two Japanese words that sound similar
but have nearly opposite meanings--kawaii means cute, and kowai means
frightening. The multimedia works included cat dolls bound together
with yarn, cat dolls in cages, and cat dolls with blackened eyes, a
reference to domestic abuse.</TE>
<TE>   "I remember one of my students came in with sunglasses," she
recalls. The woman had been beaten up and was making an attempt to
hide her bruises. "She hadn't even married this guy yet, but she was
30, and she would put up with anything."</TE>
<TE>   A Japan Times critic acknowledged the show's social commentary but
said that Scholnick was "wise to lighten her potentially heavy
explorations of cross-cultural experiences with humor."</TE>
<TE>   In 2000, Scholnick returned to Los Angeles, and, in between
teaching jobs, she began a series of drawings that melded Hello Kitty
imagery with guns and ammunition--again, an extreme juxtaposition of
kawaii with kowai. Then, while browsing a Web site for Hello Kitty
products, the idea for a video came to her.</TE>
<TE>   Her rambling downtown studio, which also serves as her apartment,
is strewn with components of the project. On the floor, the letters
"h-e-l-l-o-o-o-o" are spread out on a piece of green felt--she is
doing stop-motion animation to insert between the live-action
sequences.</TE>
<TE>   Since her return to L.A., Scholnick has had a one-woman show in
the smaller gallery at POST as well as participated in a couple of
group shows, including last year's "Big Plastic" at the Pasadena
Armory for the Arts. When she approached POST director Habib
Kheradyar, about "Hello Kitty Gets a Mouth," he signed her to open
the gallery's fall season.</TE>
<TE>   The final video, about 15 minutes long, will be the centerpiece of
an installation, shown in a Hello Kitty bedroom (by Scholnick) on a
Hello Kitty television set (ditto), which is currently in the middle
of the artist's room, on its pedestal. Hello Kitty's head frames the
screen, fur-covered with the signature three black
stripes--whiskers--on either side.</TE>
<TE>   Tacked on the walls are a dozen or so sketches. When the gallery
walls are freshly painted, Scholnick will begin drawing murals on
them. One will be based on a work done in colored chalk on a sheet of
black gessoed paper about 8 feet wide. In the lower right-hand
corner, a life-sized creature wearing a crumpled Hello Kitty hood is
pointing a handgun skyward, ready to shoot.</TE>
<TE>   Scholnick became focused on "Hello Kitty Gets a Mouth" at the end
of last year. With the story percolating in her head, she flew to
Japan at Christmas and visited Puroland, the Sanrio Co. theme park
that features characters in its animation pantheon, including Kitty.
Contained in a sprawling three-story building, Puroland has rides,
live performances and tons of merchandise.</TE>
<TE>   "I spent the whole day there," says Scholnick, who had her video
camera in hand. While in Japan, she also shot exteriors--street
scenes, views from moving trains, a plane taking off--to splice into
the final work.</TE>
<TE>   When she returned home, she began signing up cast and crew,
volunteers all.</TE>
<TE>   She storyboarded the script with her friend Margaret Adachi, a
former assistant film editor. She talked Brodo, a fellow teacher at
American Intercontinental, into being director of
photography--although on the second day of shooting, he brought along
his friend Eric Whittaker, a professional cinematographer from
Canada, and the project so enchanted him that Whittaker took over the
filming.</TE>
<TE>   The others have been recruited in the same serendipitous
fashion--Inmo, who has an eponymous gallery in Chinatown, is a
friend; Makuuchi a former student; and John Buuck, the editor, a
friend of another American Intercontinental colleague.</TE>
<TE>   Asked about the famous character she portrays, Makuuchi admits,
"When I was little, I really didn't like Hello Kitty because it's too
girly. I never liked pink."</TE>
<TE>   However, the more Scholnick considers Kitty, the more she can
relate to her.</TE>
<TE>   "Hello Kitty is kind of me," she finally admits.</TE>
<TE>   As someone often accused of being nice, perhaps too nice,
Scholnick understands the impulse behind kawaii. "You can't be too
aggressive, you have to be so nice and cute," she says. "There is a
part of me that hates that, but it's the truth."</TE>
<TE>   When Hello Kitty gets a mouth, Scholnick says, and finds her
voice, "it's really everywoman."</TE>

<HD>His Beautiful Lie</HD>
<DH>In creating a synthetic star for 'Simone,' Andrew Niccol
skewers stardom and our fascination with it</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SORINA DIACONESCU</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Andrew Niccol is squeamish at the prospect of dissecting his work. He
thinks it's pretentious to talk about art. And tiresome. "There is
this great quote from Matisse: 'An artist should cut out his own
tongue,' " he says. Is that a personal creed? "Obviously not," he
adds cheerfully as he settles in to discuss Simone, an all-too-human
virtual actress who is the star and subject of his latest film.</LD>
<LD>   A sermon in Zen koans is what one expects from Niccol, a New
Zealand-born filmmaker who has made a name for himself by drawing
filmgoers into audacious mind games.</LD>
<LD>   In the dystopian thriller "Gattaca," which marked his directorial
debut, he challenged them to consider life in a genocracy--a brave
new world where genes alone determine destiny. Then came the lauded
"Truman Show." In this cautionary fable about the costs of achieving
ultimate reality on reality TV, which Niccol wrote and Peter Weir
directed, audiences were forced to confront their own voyeuristic
impulses.</LD>
<TE>   This is a filmmaker with a headful of thoughts and qualms about
topics many successful artists skirt. He is fascinated by people's
fascination with celebrity. He talks a lot about "the strange
relationship" between Hollywood and entertainment news that, it seems
to him, are locked tighter than ever in an embrace.</TE>
<TE>   He is the type who hastens to point out to a reporter, "I wouldn't
be doing an interview if I didn't have a movie to sell, and you
probably wouldn't be interviewing me." From his early days spent
making commercials in London, he has retained, he explains, a
hyper-awareness of the marketing dynamic involved in his craft.
"Yeah, I may be a reformed smoker in some ways--you know what they're
like."</TE>
<TE>   Above all, Niccol is fixated on the line between truth and
falsity. "We're entering an interesting time where we don't know
what's fake and what's real anymore. And for me, that's an
interesting area to explore," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The result of his explorations is "Simone," a project Niccol
wrote, directed and produced two years ago that is opening in
theaters this week. The picture lampoons the celebrity culture with
unabashed glee--but most of the time with a completely straight face.
It's spiced with enough barbed wit aimed squarely at the Hollywood
myth-making machinery to make a less confident artist anxious about
never eating lunch in a certain town again.</TE>
<TE>   "Simone" features Al Pacino as Viktor Taransky, a washed-up
filmmaker who makes a spectacular comeback when he plays Pygmalion to
a blond, lusty ingenue. Simone becomes the most promising new talent
to grace the screen.</TE>
<TE>   Audiences and media alike are instantly charmed. Who would not
succumb to this most attractive, gracious star? She is statuesque,
with a fair brow and silky, straight hair--"almost an American
ideal," Niccol described her. On film, she emotes with Sophia Loren's
wounded sensuality. Her cheekbones are as exquisitely chiseled as
Audrey Hepburn's. She may be a bit of a recluse, but that
idiosyncrasy only enhances her aura. "It is precisely because she
doesn't crave the limelight that people love her," explains
Taransky--Simone's Svengali, mentor and closest collaborator.</TE>
<TE>   Make that the only collaborator--because Simone is entirely
Taransky's creation. She is a virtual simulation of a real actress,
which makes her the world's first "synthetic thespian." Her
mesmerizing appearance is an amalgamation of features borrowed from
famous screen sirens. Every day, Taransky assembles Simone on his
computer, and inserts her digitally into material shot with live
performers, or beams her via satellite to talk shows.</TE>
<TE>   No matter that she doesn't exist. The public is smitten, and
through movies, TV exposure and magazine articles, Simone explodes
into the era's biggest media sensation.</TE>
<TE>   She is a lie that becomes self-perpetuating: an achievement
possible only because of the insatiable appetite of the public to
mythologize movie stars. "We live vicariously through celebrities.
People used to say that celebrities are America's royalty; now I
think celebrities are the world's royalty," said Niccol--Simone's
creator in earnest--during a recent interview at the Hollywood loft
he calls his office.</TE>
<TE>   The work space, which he designed, is a converted warehouse with
plastic screens, skylights and a 50-foot-long table meant to
accommodate storyboards and assembled from doors purchased for $30
apiece from Home Depot. (Things masquerading as something they are
not is clearly a concept of infinite fascination for this filmmaker.)</TE>
<TE>   He ruffled a big stack of collages he put together in preparation
for "Simone," made with cutouts from fashion magazines and
advertisements. "Can you tell which ones are real and which are
retouched?" he taunted, pointing to a series of photographs depicting
beautiful women--actresses, models, ordinary people.</TE>
<TE>   Well--no, and that is the point of "Simone": In the digital age,
the distinction between reality and fantasy blurs to the point where
it ceases to matter.</TE>
<TE>   Nowadays, actors have their zits and wrinkles air-brushed in
post-production, have their jaws stretched to make for more
attractive visuals, feign contact and dialogue with things and people
who are only later spliced in or created digitally. "We manipulate
things all the time," Niccol said. "Simone is only the next step."</TE>
<TE>   "When you tell such a beautiful lie, people can't believe she
doesn't exist," Niccol said about the film's premise that the public
is above all keen to worship. The hunger to latch on to a celebrity,
even a fabricated one, "seems too prevalent to just ignore. You may
as well have at least one film that [questions], 'Should we be going
to films?' " Catching himself, he chuckled, "I'm sure that would sell
tickets!"</TE>
<TE>   In a movie in which the many facets of truth crash into slick
walls of illusion, there is always more than meets the eye. The name
Simone itself is shorthand for the computer program that fathers the
"synthespian."</TE>
<TE>   In a vein mined by Niccol in his previous work, "Simone" also
investigates the measure of responsibility the public, the mass media
and the filmmakers bear in mythologizing characters who are often
lacking in intrinsic value.</TE>
<TE>   The picture poses uncomfortable questions: Who are the culprits?
What begets what?</TE>
<TE>   "I'm just holding up a mirror, I have no answers at all," Niccol
said, feigning innocence. But later he noted that as in "The Truman
Show," the public is at least partly to blame for Simone's ascent.
"They don't have to watch. They can take a walk or read a book."</TE>
<TE>   And if they choose not to? "I was simply interested in
investigating a possibility," Niccol said. Indeed, the most
disquieting aspect of the film is its ominous insight: When Simone
finds herself in the eye of a publicity maelstrom, the surreal
aspects of her personality--the fact that she does not exist except
as a series of zeroes and ones stored in computer memory--seem to
drop away and her very presence on screen acquires a nagging sense of
realism.</TE>
<TE>   "I used to think with 'The Truman Show,' 'Oh, that's so
farfetched,' " Niccol said, as two silhouettes in dark suits peered
ominously over his shoulder from a giant "Men in Black II" ad
plastered on the side of a neighboring building. The image,
reminiscent of "Big Brother is watching you" posters, provided a
fitting backdrop for a discussion of Niccol's 1998 film about the
most real kind of reality TV, starring a character who had no clue
that his life was scripted and watched on television all over the
world.</TE>
<TE>   "Now the events have caught up with that idea," he continued. "If
you took a child from a Third World country today and said, 'You know
what? To save this child from the worst fate, we're going to record
him in the most idyllic setting, we're gonna give the child the best
of everything,'--I think most people would go for it," Niccol said.
That, of course, is the premise of "The Truman Show," which Niccol
wrote in the early 1990s, when "Big Brother," "Survivor," and "The
Real World" had yet to achieve a feverish grip on viewers' psyches
around the globe.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, we are only three to four years away from a real Simone,
said William Robbins, a special effects supervisor who coordinated
work on the movie.</TE>
<TE>   "We can generate realistic-looking people, but we have yet to
fully capture the mannerisms, the flaws" that subtly enhance a human
performance.</TE>
<TE>   As for Simone, the protagonist moviegoers will see on screen is in
fact a half-human, half-digital concoction. A team of 10 to 15
special effects technicians took about six months in a tedious
post-production process to assemble her--or rather, it.</TE>
<TE>   Should anybody claim that Simone is all image and no substance, it
helps to know that her various body parts in digitized format, took
up 1.5 terabytes, which is the storage capacity of 150 regular PCs.
"The overall amount of work was gargantuan," Robbins said. The
virtual performer appears in 210 shots, or just about every scene.
There were some real performers, photographed and melded together
into Simone--"less than 50," Niccol said coyly, explaining that he
was simply obeying studio directives not to spill the beans as to the
exact specifications of his lead hybrid. "She's part pixels and part
flesh and blood, but we don't tell you which part is which," he
added.</TE>
<TE>   But isn't this kind of secrecy what the film itself lampoons?</TE>
<TE>   "Exactly!" he said, relishing the irony. "It's life imitating
art."</TE>
<TE>   "Simone" the movie is like a Chinese box, out of which pops Simone
the synthespian, itself a shell for Simone, the creation of special
effects wizards. "I'm simulating simulation," Niccol noted with much
amusement. "I'm making a fake fake to make a point about fakes."</TE>
<TE>   Besides a slew of self-reflective, intellectual pleasures,
"Simone" has some burlesque moments meant to reflect some of the
surreally absurd moments that are bound to occur when you stick
around the movie-making enterprise long enough.</TE>
<TE>   Taransky puts on lipstick and leaves kiss marks on glossy photos
of Simone, intended for her rabid fans. A starlet complains bitterly
about the size of her trailer. ("I know there are actors who do,"
Niccol said. "They are like two-story buildings, some of these
trailers.")</TE>
<TE>   There are other gibes: only black Land Rovers, BMWs and
Mercedes-Benzes--the status symbols of Hollywood--are on the freeway.
The titles of Simone's movies are cheekily asinine: "Sunset Sunrise,"
"Eternity Forever."</TE>
<TE>   Niccol insisted that what he put in the movie was only the tip of
the iceberg. "I couldn't actually use some of the more ridiculous
things that go on in Hollywood, because people would not believe it,"
he said.</TE>
<TE>   And the film is chock-full of quotable lines.</TE>
<TE>   Simone, explaining her reluctance to meet anybody face-to-face: "I
relate better to people when they're not actually there."</TE>
<TE>   Taransky's daughter comforts him after his studio executive wife,
played by Catherine Keener, fires him from a project. "Daddy, sorry
Mom canned you."</TE>
<TE>   "I have not read 'Eternity Forever,' but it is really good,"
uttered by an actor who slavishly tries to ingratiate himself to
Taransky.</TE>
<TE>   The picture may be subversive, but Niccol said it was also "an
affectionate look at our industry....I think it's easier to slip an
idea in when people are laughing--it's like a Trojan horse."</TE>

<HD>Defying China's Unwritten Rules</HD>
<DH>Stanley Kwan took on taboo topics--gay life and Tiananmen
Square--in 'Lan Yu'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE FRIESS</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>HONG KONG</DL>
<LD>At first glance, this was not Stanley Kwan's sort of material. The
novel passed his way by producer Zhang Yongning was smut, replete
with constant and graphic sex set against a cheesy soap-opera plot.</LD>
<LD>   "I asked him, 'You want me to make a gay porno?' " the director
recalled. "I was known for making small, intimate pictures about
female characters. This didn't seem like a Stanley Kwan movie to me."</LD>
<LD>   Zhang was relentless. If it were stripped to its barest elements,
"Beijing Story" could be a small, intimate picture, he insisted. This
tale about the decade-long on-and-off relationship between a younger
man and his older businessman lover could become one of the great
Stanley Kwan movies.</LD>
<TE>   Nearly two years later, that love story--rechristened "Lan Yu,"
the name of the younger character--has been featured at major gay and
lesbian film festivals across the U.S. and Asia, including last
month's Outfest in L.A. It screened at the Sundance Film Festival. It
earned five honors, including best picture and director, at the
Golden Horse awards, Taiwan's version of the Academy Awards. (Because
of the subject matter, the film has never been released in mainland
China). It opens for a theatrical run Friday in Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, while there is sure to be debate over whether "Lan Yu" is
Kwan's greatest effort, there can be no doubt it is his most famous.
And by defying China's censors to make a film in Beijing about
same-sex love, the openly gay director from Hong Kong has broken
significant new ground for cinema in mainland China, where the film
has become an underground DVD hit.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't expect 'Lan Yu' to turn into this," the demure, pudgy
44-year-old said in an interview at a Hong Kong coffee shop late last
year. "I did this film because I came to like the story, and it
reminded me of my own relationship with my partner of the last 12
years. That is really all I saw in this."</TE>
<TE>   Audiences see more. In just 86 minutes, the film shatters several
Chinese taboos. Aside from being an unabashed gay movie and being
filmed without permission, it also features full-frontal nudity and
the first known use in Chinese cinema of footage of the 1989
Tiananmen Square massacre. The source material itself was contraband,
a novel published only on the Internet to circumvent China's censors.
That novel, posted in 1997 by a reclusive Beijing woman who now lives
in New Jersey, became a cult hit among gays across China who printed
it out and passed it along to non-wired friends.</TE>
<TE>   The Tiananmen Square portion itself is a breakthrough even though
it occupies just 30 seconds and is rendered mainly with the sound
effects of crying and gunfire. In that fast but emotional sequence,
the older character, Handong, searches for Lan Yu against a screaming
stampede fleeing the violence. The couple embrace intensely when they
locate each other, and, shortly thereafter, Handong is seen holding a
naked Lan Yu in bed as the boy sobs uncontrollably.</TE>
<TE>   Kwan insisted he didn't use what is known in China as "the June
4th incident" to make a political point but as an emotional turning
point in the movie, an event dramatic enough for Handong to recognize
his love for Lan Yu. Furthermore, it was true to the time and place
for Lan Yu, a Beijing college student in 1989; no American film set
in the 1960s, for instance, could ignore the Vietnam War, the
director noted.</TE>
<TE>   But as casual as Kwan is about his use of the crushing of
pro-democracy demonstrations, it remains such a sensitive matter 13
years later in China that many Internet sites devoted to it are
blocked. (In China, the government controls access to the Internet by
filtering out illegal sites).</TE>
<TE>   "The Tiananmen Square event gave the world a very bad impression
of the Chinese government, so the Communist Party hopes everyone can
forget it," said cinema history scholar Mei Fung, a professor at the
Beijing Film Academy. "If, even in fiction, you use Tiananmen Square
as a plot, you try to recall its memory, so it's dangerous."</TE>
<TE>   Although Kwan eschews the label of maverick, "Lan Yu" is just the
latest example of the director working against convention. As he
entered film in the late 1970s, Hong Kong cinema was moving into its
big-budget action phase. He assisted on several of those films, but
his first feature in 1985 was an intimate drama called "Women,"
inspired by stories told to him by female friends. It went on to earn
more than $230,000 at the Hong Kong box office, a large sum for that
day.</TE>
<TE>   What followed was a procession of estrogen-charged films with
titles like "Two Sisters," "Red Rose, White Rose" and "Rouge," which
built his reputation as an actress' director. So when Kwan decided to
do "Lan Yu," top Chinese actors lined up for the chance to perform in
that rare Kwan film featuring strong male leads. He wound up casting
two of China's premier matinee idols, Liu Ye as Lan Yu and Hu Jun as
Handong, the older man whose struggle with his sexuality stands in
the way of an honest relationship. Neither star had appeared before
in films that played outside China.</TE>
<TE>   "I had seen all of his films, and I adored them," Hu recalled of
Kwan. "He is the most strict director, but actors respect him because
they've seen the results. Strict is not a bad term. It just means he
is careful, always trying to be perfect."</TE>
<TE>   Both actors told Kwan they are straight men with little personal
experience with gay people, so Kwan described his relationship in
detail to school them on the same-sex dynamic. Nonetheless, Liu
confessed it took him weeks to start regarding Hu's character as a
lover instead of a big-brother figure, and Hu noted that he took
pains in scenes that involved nudity and kissing "to not let the
audience know this was not natural."</TE>
<TE>   Zhang, a first-time movie producer and former BBC documentarian,
is gratified that so many Chinese people have told him they wanted to
see the movie on DVD. Although he's not pleased that black-market DVD
sales in mainland China do not provide him with revenue, he views
"Lan Yu" as an agent of progress for mainland gays and recognizes it
could never be distributed legitimately there anyway.</TE>
<TE>   Homosexuality only recently began to seep into China's public
consciousness. There's no national law specifically addressing gay
sexuality, and the Buddhism and Taoism practiced by many Chinese have
no specific objections to it. However, cultural pressures to marry
remain intense, and gay issues almost never are discussed in the
state-run media.</TE>
<TE>   Yet gay clubs in Shanghai, Beijing and other cities are
proliferating, the Internet is allowing gays to meet through chat
rooms and the Chinese Psychological Assn. declassified homosexuality
as an illness a year ago. Last fall, the Ministry of Health said that
it needed to do more to combat AIDS among gay Chinese, the first
public acknowledgment by the government that a gay community even
exists.</TE>
<TE>   On screen, then, it is not surprising that gay romance has never
passed the Ministry of Film's censors. No mainland Chinese film
depicting a lesbian relationship has ever been distributed anywhere,
and the only other film shot there to deal with male homosexuality
was the demeaning "East Palace, West Palace," in which a gay man
arrested for cruising in a park is shown as a depraved, pathetic
deviant.</TE>
<TE>   " 'Lan Yu' gives a true image of gay people in mainland China,
talking their language and showing their ability to love each other
and coming across as very realistic," said Mei, the film scholar.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the litany of awards for "Lan Yu," the film is not
universally admired. Viewers unfamiliar with the intricacies of
recent Chinese history and culture say they have trouble following
the timeline and backdrop of the plot because Kwan forces the
audience to decipher through the dialogue how much time had passed
between scenes.</TE>
<TE>   One high-profile defender of the film is Ang Lee, director of the
2000 box office hit "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon" as well as the
1993 film "The Wedding Banquet," a cult comedy hit about the gay
relationship between a Chinese immigrant and an American.</TE>
<TE>   "If you're willing to go along with the way Stanley tells the
story, you'll have a good time," Lee said. "The audience has to do a
lot of filling in, that is true, but this is a very, very well-done
melodrama with great emotions."</TE>
<TE>   Kwan, who has moved on to work on a Chinese TV movie since "Lan
Yu," is wary of being typecast as a gay director making gay movies.
Still, he outed himself in his 1996 documentary, "Yang and Yin:
Gender in Chinese Cinema," by interviewing his mother about her
thoughts about his sexual orientation.</TE>
<TE>   And, in the end, Kwan acknowledges, he believes "Lan Yu" is
important mainly because it respects gay people.</TE>
<TE>   "Some of my friends told me this is a comfortable film about the
gay relationship," he said. "They weren't offended by the film or the
performance because they said it seemed very, well, natural. That's

<HD>Written Off ... Unfairly?</HD>
<DH>When artists consistently disappoint, we tend to forget
their successes. Case in point: Cher. She once showed artistic
promise--really.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBERT HILBURN</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>There were a lot of great records by female singers in the early days
of rock--from the gospel-shaded R&amp;B of Faye Adams' "Shake a Hand" to
the youthful intensity of Brenda Lee's "Sweet Nothin's."</LD>
<LD>   None, however, reflected the authority and command that we
associate with rock 'n' roll today as much as the key early hits
by--brace yourself--Cher.</LD>
<LD>   The fact that Cher is rarely, if ever mentioned now as a
touchstone of rock underscores how we pop critics and fans can let an
artist's image and worst work blind us to the occasional successes.</LD>
<TE>   For years, Cher's music has been so anonymous and annoying, and
her persona so cartoonish, that it's hard to remember the sensual
dynamics of her voice in the records that first brought her fame in
the mid-'60s.</TE>
<TE>   These ranged from the best of the Sonny &amp; Cher hits, highlighted
by the underdog spirit and punch of "I Got You Babe," to a solo
rendition of Bob Dylan's "All I Really Want to Do" that was more
absorbing than competing versions by the Byrds and Dylan himself.</TE>
<TE>   Rock was subsequently blessed with the staggering blues
exclamations of Janis Joplin in the late '60s and the raw poetic
force of Patti Smith in the mid-'70s. Yet no one matched the pure,
seductive wallop of Cher until Chrissie Hynde arrived with the
Pretenders in 1979.</TE>
<TE>   Hynde was 13 in the summer of 1965 when Sonny &amp; Cher's "I Got You
Babe" spent three weeks at No. 1 on the sales chart, and it's easy to
picture the Akron, Ohio, native listening to the song over and over
in her room.</TE>
<TE>   Hynde, who is likely to be inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of
Fame the moment she's eligible in 2004, even recorded "I Got You
Babe" in 1985 with the British reggae-pop group UB40. It was a Top 30
hit in the U.S.</TE>
<TE>   By the time Hynde came on the scene, Cher's recordings--from the
plodding "Gypsys, Tramps &amp; Thieves" to the passionless "The Way of
Love"--were so inconsequential that few critics or fans would even
mention the two singers in the same context.</TE>
<TE>   Hynde is near or at the top of most lists of great rock singers.
Her rivals would almost all come from the last two decades: Kate
Bush, Polly Jean Harvey, Sinead O'Connor. Cher is rarely even cited
as an influence in glowing critical appraisals of Hynde.</TE>
<TE>   Cher's not the only singer whose early contributions to pop and
rock have been largely erased from much of the pop consciousness
because their careers took disappointing turns.</TE>
<TE>   Although Rod Stewart is a member of the Rock and Roll Hall of
Fame, many young rock fans must think his presence in the hall is as
strange as Frankie Valli's.</TE>
<TE>   The truth, however, is that Stewart was widely hailed as one of
rock's most engaging singers in the early '70s, as a member of the
band Faces and on his own. His "Every Picture Tells a Story," which
contains the wistful "Maggie May" and the anguishing "Reason to
Believe," is considered to be his definitive statement. Two earlier
solo collections, "The Rod Stewart Album" and "Gasoline Alley," also
showcase his custom mix of soul and rock influences.</TE>
<TE>   Though less consistently, Stewart continued to come up with some
moving tracks in the '70s, including "You're in My Heart," one of the
most graceful love songs of the rock era. But Stewart became a parody
of himself, caught up in the "stud rocker" role around the time of
"Da Ya Think I'm Sexy?"</TE>
<TE>   The Carpenters and Billy Joel are among other artists whose
contributions to pop or rock have been downplayed because the genuine
highlights are lost in a much less distinguished body of work.</TE>
<TE>   But our focus today is on Cher because she is saying goodbye to
concert touring.</TE>
<TE>   I had plans to review her show earlier this month at Staples
Center, and when I made those plans, my intent was to look for ways
to give her thanks for the early days. I was surprised by my
enthusiasm, because I haven't had a kind word to say about Cher's
music for years. I thought her 1999 concert at the Arrowhead Pond was
painful, and I designated her "Believe" as worst single of that year.
This time, I thought, would be different.</TE>
<TE>   But what if it wasn't? What if she opened the show by butchering
U2's "I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For," just as she had at
the Pond? What if she ran through all of the unimaginative hits, from
"Just Like Jesse James" to "Believe"?</TE>
<TE>   In the end, I decided to go to Staples Center as a fan, not a
critic, and it was a liberating change. Ever the optimist, I even
imagined that Cher, one of the true comeback kids of show biz, might
even use the final tour to reconnect with her early promise. The show
quickly brought me back to reality.</TE>
<TE>   She indeed opened with the U2 song and the hits followed like lava
from a volcano, many of them dressed in the same, recycled disco
trimmings of "Believe."</TE>
<TE>   My single moment of excitement was when Cher went into "All I
Really Want to Do."</TE>
<TE>   The song came and went so fast that it even felt as if she had
shortened it for the show. Neither she nor the audience treated it as
anything special.</TE>
<TE>   As she moved into other material, I kept thinking about what might
have been with Cher.</TE>
<TE>   Although blessed with a dynamic voice, she has never shown much
instinct for subtlety or phrasing. There's very little in the form of
character or unexpected emotional twists. Rolling Stone once
underscored that lack of character by declaring that Cher's vocal
style was "pancake-flat."</TE>
<TE>   Sonny Bono, however, knew how to add syrup to that voice in a way
that made it appetizing. In the best of their records together, Bono
employed many of the lavish, even melodramatic arrangement principles
he learned from being in the studio with Phil Spector, the legendary
producer whose "girl group" recordings in the '60s are among the most
articulate pop expressions ever of teen innocence and yearning.</TE>
<TE>   Although various producers crafted hits for Cher, none showcased
her vocal traits as convincingly--except, interestingly enough,
Spector himself.</TE>
<TE>   In a comeback attempt of his own in the mid-'70s, Spector went
into the studio with Cher. After his string of teen hits such as "Be
My Baby" and "He's a Rebel" in the early '60s, Spector crafted even
more ambitious adult pop dramas in the Righteous Brothers' "You've
Lost That Lovin' Feelin' " and Ike &amp; Tina Turner's "River Deep,
Mountain High."</TE>
<TE>   Spector wanted to scale those creative heights again. First, he
teamed Cher with Harry Nilsson on a lush remake of Holland, Dozier,
Holland's "A Love Like Yours (Don't Come Knocking Every Day)," and
then he had Cher tackle "A Woman's Story," an epic tale of survival
instincts.</TE>
<TE>   Neither track was a hit, but they were impressive works. If they
had caught on, it's interesting to speculate about how Cher's career
trajectory might have been different, what artistic achievement she
might have tapped.</TE>
<TE>   She has continued to be a star, but, I swear, Cher could have been
a contender.</TE>

<HD>They're Not Afraid of 'Virginia Woolf'</HD>
<DH>'ER's' Ellen Crawford and husband Michael Genovese enjoy
the ride Edward Albee's play takes them on</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SUSAN KING</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Friends ask actress Ellen Crawford and her husband, actor Michael
Genovese, how they can play the roles of the venomous George and
Martha in Edward Albee's "Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?" without
wanting to kill each other.</LD>
<LD>   Crawford just smiles every time she's asked that question. "We
have said it's like having really good sex," says Crawford, who
appears on NBC's top-rated dramatic series, "ER," as nurse Lydia
Wright. "The exhilaration--both physically and emotionally ... and we
get to surprise each other every night. This play takes you places.
It's all within the framework of the play. When it's working right,
it's very alive."</LD>
<LD>   "There are a couple of places in the play where I have no idea why
they take me, but they take me somewhere," says Genovese, who also
happens to play Wright's husband, police Sgt. Al Grabowsky, on "ER."
"But I am not afraid to go there."</LD>
<TE>   The couple, who will celebrate their 20th anniversary this fall,
are relaxing on the tiny stage of the Blank Theatre Company's
intimate 2nd Stage Theatre on Santa Monica Boulevard in Hollywood. On
this afternoon, the two are about to begin rehearsals for "Virginia
Woolf," which was scheduled to open Saturday for a monthlong
engagement. This production was originally staged last fall at the
San Diego Repertory Theatre with Crawford and Genovese. Todd Salovey,
who directed in San Diego, is returning.</TE>
<TE>   This production marks the 40th anniversary of the Tony
Award-winning play, which has not been performed in a regular
engagement in Los Angeles since Albee directed John Lithgow and
Glenda Jackson in 1989 at the Doolittle Theatre.</TE>
<TE>   Crawford explains that Albee is very protective about the rights
to "Virginia Woolf." "He has to personally approve all the casting in
every production," she says.</TE>
<TE>   "Albee wants the words said the way he's written them in the order
he's written them--that is part of the contract," Genovese says.</TE>
<TE>   "You cannot cut it, you cannot change anything," adds Crawford.</TE>
<TE>   "There have been attempts to do it with four men," continues
Genovese. "He said he wrote this about two heterosexual couples: 'If
I wanted to write about four men, I would have written about four
men.' "</TE>
<TE>   "Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?" takes place over one nightmarish
night when an embittered history professor, George, and Martha, his
acerbic wife of 23 years who happens to be the daughter of the
university's president, invite new faculty member Nick, an ambitious
young man, and his simpering wife, Honey, over for drinks. Uta Hagen
and Arthur Hill starred in the original Broadway production. Richard
Burton, Elizabeth Taylor (who won an Oscar), George Segal and Sandy
Dennis (also an Oscar winner) starred in Mike Nichols' classic 1966
film version.</TE>
<TE>   More often than not, Crawford says, a playwright's stage
directions don't give much insight into a character. That's not the
case with Albee. "It's like following a map," she says. "There are
plenty of chances to go many ways. But sometimes, because of his
stage directions, he takes you in a direction I might not have
thought of and will lead me to the next point in the play. I really
have been appreciative of those. He thinks musically when he writes."</TE>
<TE>   Doing the play has been a longtime passion for Crawford. Genovese,
though, wasn't originally scheduled to perform in San Diego, but two
weeks into rehearsals, the original George got hurt and left the
production. Reviews for their performances were glowing. "Genovese
and Crawford are a joy to watch," said Jim Trageser in the San Diego
Press-Enterprise. "It's like listening to two veteran jazz musicians
trade solos back and forth. Their timing and interplay are right on
target."</TE>
<TE>   "Crawford ... shows enormous range as the fearsome and vulgar
first lady of the stage, Martha," said Pam Kragen in the North County
Times. "And Genovese, with his staccato, monotone delivery and
haunted eyes, inhabits the withered, gone-to-seed shell of George,
whose only satisfaction in life is cruelly taunting his wife and
visitors and drinking himself into a stupor."</TE>
<TE>   When asked if she had performed in the play before last year,
Crawford hangs down her head in embarrassment and gives a glance over
to her husband. "Can I tell her?" she asks Genovese. "I don't want to
get Edward Albee mad."</TE>
<TE>   "Sure you can," he says with a smile.</TE>
<TE>   "My very first professional job when I was 18 was 'Hair,' the
Chicago production," Crawford says. "There were some of us who
basically wanted to be actors and weren't necessarily rock musicians
who loved this play."</TE>
<TE>   So one Saturday evening, after completing 6 and 10 p.m. shows of
"Hair," the group gathered at co-star Joe Mantegna's apartment. In
front of friends and family, they performed "Virginia Woolf" in
Mantegna's living room.</TE>
<TE>   "We did the play essentially in the hours it takes place,"
Crawford says. "We maybe started at 1:30 in the morning. I threw up
on cue! Andre De Shields was Martha, but we called him Marty."</TE>
<TE>   Genovese also has an affinity for Albee. "Back when I was going to
college during the Punic Wars," he says laughing, "it was the heyday
of the Absurdists. I had done two productions of Albee's 'Zoo Story'
and directed a production of 'American Dream' when I was in college
[at Eastern Illinois University], Ellen had done 'The Sandbox' and
'American Dream.' "</TE>
<TE>   He relishes the rhythms of Albee's dialogue in 'Virginia Woolf."
"They crackle and pop," he says. "When you get them right, they sort
of bounce and you have an audience out there responding."</TE>
<TE>   Although the two have done their fair share of television and
movies, they both consider themselves theater animals. Because of his
wife's stint on "ER" for the past nine seasons, Genovese has been
able to concentrate primarily on theater. It's been hard on Crawford,
though, when her husband's work takes him out of town.</TE>
<TE>   "In the last half-dozen years, I have been doing less TV," he
says. "I have been going out of town a lot--San Diego, Berkeley and
Denver. I did an 'Uncle Vanya.' I did a 'Death of a Salesman.' I did
'Tartuffe' and 'The Collected Works of Billy the Kid' at La Jolla."</TE>
<TE>   While "Virginia Woolf" is in production, Crawford will be shooting
"ER"--Genovese, who was recurring on "ER," hasn't appeared on the
series in a few seasons. The show's producers have always been good
about allowing their actors time off for other projects. Crawford
also won't have problems because "ER" star Noah Wyle is artistic
producer of the Blank Theatre.</TE>
<TE>   When "ER" started, Crawford says, executive producer John Wells
told her, " 'If you want to do a film or another show or a play,
there will always be room for you here.' That's a nice situation.
People can only improve their work by taking on projects."</TE>
<TE>   When the couple first moved out to Los Angeles in the '80s, they
rarely worked together. "He was doing a lot of TV and film," Crawford
says. "I would never be cast opposite him because he was always being
cast as the bad boy boyfriend of the hot young leading lady. I am a
character actress. As he went more into character roles, producers
decided we could play off of each other."</TE>
<TE>   Crawford and Genovese first met in the 1970s at the Arena Stage in
Washington. "I was living with a woman, and Ellen was doing a show
with the woman I was living with," he says. Over the decade, they
kept running into each other doing regional theater gigs.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, in 1977, they became a couple after they were cast
together in a production of Harold Pinter's "Old Times."</TE>
<TE>   Ironically, the two had been warned by friends 25 years ago that
they would have a difficult time working together.</TE>
<TE>   Crawford recalls: "They told him, 'She went to Carnegie-Mellon
University. She's classically trained. She's very specific. She'll
make you crazy because she'll want everything a certain way.' "</TE>
<TE>   Friends told her that Genovese was a "wild" actor. "He is scary,"
she says. "But what happened is that we discovered that we had a
great time working together because he encouraged in me a sense of
freedom and probably I brought some sort of specificity. The marriage
of the two--even before the marriage--was really magical, I thought."</TE>
<TE>   Crawford shoots her husband a loving glance. "I agree," he tells
her with a warm, knowing smile.</TE>

<HD>The Swedes Are Coming</HD>
<DH>It's not just the Hives. The nation is emerging as a major
center of innovative garage rock.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DEAN KUIPERS</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When members of the punk band Division of Laura Lee, based in
Goteborg, Sweden, began to play live shows, they were convinced they
could be the best band in the world. Music in other countries, they
decided, had become too refined. U2 or Radiohead simply didn't need
rock 'n' roll the way they did.</LD>
<LD>   For Division of Laura Lee, or D.O.L.L., as the band is known, rock
was about transforming pain into a party--or at least into the
gut-wrenching Jesus and Mary Chain-type howl captured on its debut
album, "Black City," just released by Burning Heart/Epitaph Records.</LD>
<LD>   "We're working-class kids," says Jonas Gustafsson, 23, the lanky,
laconic bassist for D.O.L.L., on the phone from his home in
Vanersborg, just north of Goteborg. "It's a town where you either do
drugs or work at the Saab factory, and we were outsiders. You have to
believe in something."</LD>
<TE>   Not coincidentally, this is the same story told by the Hives, a
more glam-tinted Swedish garage-rock outfit from industrial Fagersta
that has taken the U.S. pop media by storm with its fun juggernaut of
a second album, "Veni Vidi Vicious." The Hives' self-declared status
as "Your New Favorite Band"--a Hives album title--seems to be gaining
validity as "Vicious" has sold more than 225,000 in the U.S. The band
recently signed a $10-million, three-album deal with Universal
Records after a fierce battle between Universal and Warner Bros., and
has a new album due in the fall.</TE>
<TE>   This is big news for the U.S., where garage rock styles have
gained new notoriety with the Strokes and White Stripes, but not back
in ultra-pragmatic Sweden, where '60s-style garage rock has been
exploding for the past decade. With the Hives' success, many in the
country of only 8 million are queuing up to join the many Swedish
bands that have been touring the U.S. and challenge the Hives' title.
There are also several other bands making U.S. album deals. It's
looking like a Swedish Invasion.</TE>
<TE>   "I think a few Swedish bands might get snapped up, as there's a
lot of good stuff out here," says Peter Ahlqvist, president of
Burning Heart Records, a label in Orebro, 100 miles west of
Stockholm, that first put out the Hives and other Scandinavian bands.</TE>
<TE>   "There's some buzz. D.O.L.L. is getting some attention, The
(International) Noise Conspiracy too. There's talk about the
Soundtrack of Our Lives, and there'll indeed be lots of talk about
the fabulous denim-demons Turbonegro, who are back. They are
Norwegian, but that's damn close."</TE>
<TE>   That all these bands sound quite different is an indication of a
very healthy Scandinavian scene.</TE>
<TE>   The (International) Noise Conspiracy is a strident, five-person
punk thrash band with hip outfits and anti-capitalist messages,
rendered more European by just a splish of cabaret and a splash of
KMFDM-style techno-goth. It's taking the material from its 2001
album, "New Morning, Changing Weather," to the U.S. in September on
the Plea for Peace Tour with Jimmy Eat World and the Promise Ring,
then again in October with D.O.L.L.</TE>
<TE>   The Soundtrack of Our Lives, currently touring the U.S. with
Oasis, is made up of former members of Stooges sound-alike Union
Carbide Productions, reformulated with a slightly more melodic Stones
or Who sound. The band's 2001 album, "Behind the Music," was released
to critical acclaim and has been out in the U.S. on Hidden Agenda
Records for almost a year. After the band emerged as the hit of the
2002 South by Southwest music conference in Austin in March,
Universal Records licensed the album for the U.S. and will be
re-releasing it Sept. 24.</TE>
<TE>   Norwegian hard-core act Turbonegro, whose 1998 album, "Apocalypse
Dudes," is recognized as one of the most influential Scandinavian
punk records, was known for glammed-up denim outfits. The band broke
up in 1998 but has reformed after replacing Alice Cooper-like singer
Hank Von Helvete. Queens of the Stone Age covered the song "Back to
Dungaree High" on a 2001 Turbonegro tribute compilation on Get Hip
Records' "Alpha."</TE>
<TE>   Major labels are hearing more than buzz. They sense commercial pay
dirt. Vivendi Universal was so keen on getting the Hives that the
company indemnified the band against delivering the one album it
allegedly still owes to Burning Heart, and Ahlqvist says he's not
surprised the label went that far to sign the band.</TE>
<TE>   "It's simple: They are a great band that looks good, write
fantastic songs and make brilliant videos, and arrived at the right
time," Ahlqvist says. "If they are gonna become big entertainers is
up to them. They are at least bringing back some joy to music and
influencing a lot of people."</TE>
<TE>   For some American rock 'n' roll traditionalists, it makes no
difference that the "joy" is coming from Sweden, especially because
virtually all of the bands sing in English. "I was the first guy to
declare that the Hives were the greatest band in the world," enthuses
Mike LaVella, 37, publisher of the San Francisco-based hot rod 'zine
Gearhead.</TE>
<TE>   Tapping the car culture's interest in garage and punk bands,
Gearhead Records, the magazine's label, released Hives music in the
U.S., as well as Swedish garage originators the Nomads and more
recent bands such as the Demons and the Hellacopters. "I heard
'Barely Legal' in '97, and I flipped out," says LaVella, referring to
the Hives' first album. "Along with it, of course, were all these
other Swedish bands. I knew how great this scene was."</TE>
<TE>   Gearhead has become the sponsor of the biggest garage-rock
festival in Scandinavia, the biannual Gearfest, which was put
together in 1998 by the Nomads. The third Gearfest, in June 2002,
played Stockholm, Helsinki and Oslo, and featured the Hives, the
Nomads, Thee Ultra Bimboos, the Demons, the Flaming Sideburns and
Mensen, a Runaways-style female punk group from Norway.</TE>
<TE>   LaVella says the Swedish invasion has been brewing for years. In
recent decades, Sweden has been the third-biggest global exporter of
music, after the U.S. and Britain, and now it has the musical
antidote to same-sounding mainstream R&amp;B, pop punk and nu-metal. The
Swedes are hip to the '50s and '60s roots of garage-rock culture, he
says, and have the right mix of erudition and angst to produce
urgent, irrepressible punk rock.</TE>
<TE>   "The long winters have a lot to do with it," LaVella says. "In
winter, the sun comes out for one hour a day. People get depressed.
The suicide rate is high. A lot of people turn to alcohol. If you're
a person that's basically on the ball, you turn to rock 'n' roll."</TE>
<TE>   "Me and the other guys in our band grew up with the punk wave of
'77, and we were huge fans of the Ramones and the Clash," says Nomads
guitarist and singer Niklas Vahlberg, 39, from his home in Stockholm.
"Then hard-core came in, and we just turned to older music--the
Stooges, the MC5 and '60s garage bands."</TE>
<TE>   Sweden has seen two waves of garage rock. In the mid-'80s, the
Nomads, who are credited with founding the current scene, the Creeps
and Union Carbide Productions got some attention in the U.S. Then the
Hellacopters, Backyard Babies and the Soundtrack of Our Lives emerged
in the late '90s and marked the new wave that has propelled the
Hives.</TE>
<TE>   "The Hives are a great band," Vahlberg says. "The last real
breakthrough like this was 10 years ago, with Nirvana."</TE>
<TE>   Great garage-rock, of course, like the punk of Nirvana, is born
out of gritty desperation. The secret of the Swedes' success seems to
be that they share the same drive for fun and validation that
inspired garage bands from the Bobby Fuller Four and the Kingsmen to
the form's all-time American apex with the Stooges, MC5 and the Sonic
Rendezvous Band.</TE>
<TE>   With one caveat: The Stooges were infamous for failing to
entertain, for being too raw, for making music that was a
soul-scraping bid for power instead of pop. It was a sound that said
everything was not right with America or the entertainment culture
standing in for the promised cultural revolution.</TE>
<TE>   The Hives are more like the Ramones and Dead Boys, who picked up
this self-destruction act and turned it into punk fun. The band's
garage sound and faux-snooty shtick isn't garage or snooty at all,
but a meticulously rehearsed and packaged stylization meant to
conjure up the MC5 or Iggy without being so dangerous.</TE>
<TE>   Songs like "Main Offender" and "Supply and Demand" give more of a
nod to pop than the Detroit originators could ever muster. Still,
this festering--and spreading--garage outbreak can't signify that
life is peachy in Sweden.</TE>
<TE>   The Soundtrack of Our Lives and D.O.L.L., in particular, are
clearly fighting their way out from beneath the crushing pragmatism
of Swedish life. One obscenity-spiked D.O.L.L. song is lead vocalist
and guitarist Per Stalberg's reaction to the false normalcy and
egalitarianism of Sweden's Socialist utopia. The same universal care
that gives people equal rights to health services and education also
systematically discourages the feeling of transcendence, or even
cockiness, that makes great rock music. Government grants cover
everything from the cost of instruments to practice spaces to a
manager, but Swedish society also holds that rock stardom is vulgar
and that making a spectacle of oneself is shameful.</TE>
<TE>   "Per had a really tough childhood," says bassist Gustafsson. "On
stage, he always says, 'This is the real life right here at the show,
not the world you all live in.' He was kind of the ugly duckling. But
he got out of it. He's really handsome nowadays."</TE>
<TE>   This is rock's promise of transformation laid bare, and, for
Swedes, it's a more common one every day. Who's next for validation?
Rolling Stone recently featured all-female Swedish punk band Sahara
Hotnights as one of "10 artists to watch."</TE>
<TE>   The Soundtrack of Our Lives and D.O.L.L. have become critics'
darlings. LaVella says he's laying odds on the Demons. Their punk act
is young, handsome, hungry and outrageous. Or the Hellacopters, whose
run is far from over.</TE>
<TE>   "All those ... bands are good," LaVella says. "Of course, now the
wave of Hives imitators are coming, just like with the Hellacopters
before them. But the good bands always rise to the top. Especially in
a small place like Sweden."</TE>

<LD>Here is a smorgasbord of Swedish bands playing a new wave of garage
rock and punk:</LD>
<LD>   Millencolin: With their March album "Home From Home" (Burning
Heart / Epitaph), their fifth U.S. full-length, the skateboard-loving
pop punkers complete the career arc of most Orange County bands: from
hard-core to ska to pop.</LD>
<LD>   *</LD>
<TE>   Sahara Hotnights: From northern Sweden, an all-female answer to
the Hives, including look-alike sisters Jennie Asplund on guitar and
Johanna Asplund on bass. The release next month of "Jennie Bomb" (on
the Jetset label) should establish them as the new punk darlings.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Hellacopters: Pure garage from a band with hair and guitar
hooks like Humble Pie's. "High Visibility" is the polished album
version; "Cream of the Crap" (both Gearhead) is the trash-can
collection of such gems as its version of Iggy Pop and James
Williamson's "I Got a Right."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Demons: More energy than the Hives but less craft. On "...
Come Bursting Out!" (Gearhead), the Demons come on with a '77 punk
attitude and a guitar sound reminiscent of Fu Manchu or Queens of the
Stone Age. A yet-untitled album is set for fall release.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Nomads: Stockholm garage rock's elder statesmen lacked the
polish or contemporary bite of their younger counterparts on 2001's
"Up-Tight" (Sympathy for the Record Industry), but many of their
dozen or so releases (nine in the U.S.) are considered classics.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Citizen Bird: Its second album, "Citizen Bird," was released this
year on Stinky Records. With a more psychedelic, moody, emo punk
sound, Citizen Bird is less raucous than the Seeds and darker, like
the Stranglers.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Backyard Babies: You can't be a Swedish rocker if you don't own a
copy of its second release, "Total 13." Although subsequent releases
are not as high-energy as the Hives or D.O.L.L., the band has the
attack of the Ramones with traces of Cheap Trick power pop and
Hollywood glam-metal a la Hanoi Rocks.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Robots: Its 2000 release "Day of the Robots (Man's Ruin)" is a
Robert Williams painting become pure sound, with singer Odd coming on
like a rockabilly space alien.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Puffball: The album sleeve for its U.S. debut Gearhead release,
"The Super Commando," says, "Puffball stays true to the anti-ska
movement." Blazing fast, straight-ahead garage, with a singer rasping
like Motorhead's Lemmy.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Flaming Sideburns: The 2000 album "It's Time to Testify,
Brothers and Sisters" (Bad Afro) is purist '60s-'70s rock 'n' roll,
with elements of Detroit proto-punk, Rolling Stones, hard R&amp;B soul
and garage.</TE>

<HD>A Core Dilemma</HD>
<DH>The Grand Avenue 'Cultural Corridor' on Bunker Hill is
aloof from the grittier but humanizing reality below. Can the two
visions of downtown L.A. be reconciled?</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NICOLAI OUROUSSOFF</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>There are two faces of culture in downtown Los Angeles. One is the
soaring cluster of civic monuments and forbidding towers at the top
of Bunker Hill. The other is the loose-knit collection of cultural
enclaves scattered amid the various ethnic neighborhoods and aging
movie palaces to the east, at the bottom of the hill.</LD>
<LD>   Over the next year or so, most of the city's aspirations for
downtown will be focused on the top of the hill: the short stretch of
Grand Avenue, barely a quarter-mile long, that civic boosters have
dubbed L.A.'s "Cultural Corridor." On Sept. 2, Cardinal Roger M.
Mahony will dedicate the $163-million Cathedral of Our Lady of the
Angels, designed by the celebrated Spanish architect Jose Rafael
Moneo, at the corner of Grand Avenue and Temple Street. A block away,
the billowing, stainless steel forms of Frank Gehry's $275-million
Walt Disney Concert Hall are taking final shape. And sometime next
year, a team led by developer Jim Thomas and billionaire Eli Broad is
hoping to unveil a proposal for a $1.2-billion entertainment, retail
and hotel complex on the avenue's three remaining empty lots between
1st and 2nd streets.</LD>
<TE>   But if Grand Avenue is the symbol of downtown's cultural
resurgence, it can also be seen as a cabinet of architectural
curiosities, a sometimes beautiful distraction from the real city
below. That city includes the grittier immigrant shopping district
along Broadway, the ethnic enclave of Little Tokyo and the partially
abandoned manufacturing and warehouse district that stretches south
along the rail yards that divide downtown and East L.A.</TE>
<TE>   Bounded by the 101 Freeway to the north, the L.A. River to the
east, and Olympic Boulevard to the south, these neighborhoods are
percolating with a different kind of cultural activity. Among the
projects being proposed here are a new Children's Museum and art park
near the Geffen Contemporary, a planned expansion and renovation of
the Japanese American Cultural and Community Center, a 1,000-seat
performance hall in the former St. Vibiana's Cathedral and the
renovation of a number of Broadway's historic 1920s-era theaters.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, several developers are busily transforming many of
downtown's historic buildings into housing for the young architects,
artists, designers and other urban pioneers who are fueling this
cultural shift.</TE>
<TE>   To architects, this transformation suggests a more nuanced urban
experience than the one taking place along Grand Avenue. Its diverse
ethnic and cultural communities represent a traditional idea of the
metropolis as a place of creative friction. Its relatively porous
urban fabric, embedded with historical memory, is ideal for
architectural experimentation.</TE>
<TE>   The revived interest may surprise those who have long considered
downtown L.A. irredeemable, a place that, as the late British
architecture critic Reyner Banham put it, "began to disintegrate long
ago--out of a sheer irrelevance."</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, if Grand Avenue is emerging as an emblem of the
post-Industrial Imperial City, its future may be determined by the
neighborhoods to the east. These areas may rely on Grand for a sense
of identity. But without the greater degree of social complexity,
Grand Avenue will continue to exist in an urban vacuum, a prominent
but lifeless symbol of the city's cultural aspirations.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm concerned that this city will never really be a city," Broad
says. "And for L.A. to be a great city, it has to have a vital
center."</TE>
<TE>   The division of downtown into two rival visions is rooted in its
peculiar history. In the 1920s, downtown Los Angeles was pulsing with
life. An extensive light-rail system crisscrossed its dense street
grid, its tentacles drawing people in from the surrounding suburbs.
Shoppers spilled out of Beaux Arts office buildings and department
stores.</TE>
<TE>   But by the end of the decade, it was clear that the future of Los
Angeles lay elsewhere, in a growing constellation of suburban
enclaves. Downtown's historic structures fell into decay, and its
parks and streets were abandoned to vagrants, immigrants and other
social outcasts.</TE>
<TE>   It wasn't until the late 1950s that the city's political and
business elites began clamoring for renewal. Their aim was to make
downtown palatable again for the city's affluent classes, and they
set out to cleanse downtown of the human and physical debris that lay
in the path of progress.</TE>
<TE>   The result was one of Los Angeles' great urban atrocities: the
bulldozing of 136 acres of Bunker Hill, a once-bucolic neighborhood
of Victorian homes and hotels that had decayed into a string of
run-down rooming houses. As if to underline their intent, city
planners renamed the strip, from Charity Street to Grand Avenue.</TE>
<TE>   What rose in its place were the kind of imposing, isolated
mega-structures then the norm in urban planning circles. In 1964, the
Music Center opened at Grand Avenue between 1st and Temple. It was
touted as evidence of the city's cultural arrival. But as
architecture, the center was an undistinguished complex of brooding
concrete structures whose sterile plaza seemed to float above the
avenue like the deck of an aircraft carrier. That was followed by
billion-dollar corporate mega-developments, such as Arco Center, the
World Trade Center and California Plaza, with the Arata
Isozaki-designed Museum of Contemporary Art partially buried
underneath its cast-concrete plaza.</TE>
<TE>   Together, these structures had the feel of a sterile corporate
acropolis--an isolated world linked by internal courtyards and
elevated walkways. More chilling still, they created two parallel
worlds, what urban critic Mike Davis once dubbed downtown's unique
"spatial apartheid." At the top was a barely functioning business and
cultural district that stood as a cliche of urban alienation. At the
bottom, across Hope Street to the east, the historic fabric of
downtown was abandoned to a mix of immigrant communities and homeless
people.</TE>
<TE>   The focus on Grand Avenue, however, had unexpected benefits. The
relative economic neglect that defined the rest of downtown meant
that most of its older buildings were left intact. Latino immigrants
reclaimed Broadway as a major shopping corridor. And neighborhoods
such as Little Tokyo and Chinatown were able to preserve their
distinct identities.</TE>
<TE>   The result represented an urban experience of remarkable social
complexity, one that inevitably sparked the imaginations of L.A.'s
bohemian scene. The first wave of artists arrived in the early 1980s,
setting up shop in abandoned buildings scattered throughout the
manufacturing district to the south of Little Tokyo.  Soon, dozens of
small underground galleries and performance spaces began appearing,
including the LACE and LEICA galleries and the L.A. Theatre Center,
which were then at the forefront of the city's budding art scene.</TE>
<TE>   In 1983, the nascent Museum of Contemporary Art opened the
Gehry-designed Temporary Contemporary (later renamed the Geffen
Contemporary) in Little Tokyo. Housed in two existing warehouses, the
museum's popular success made it an instant landmark. The structure's
industrial aesthetic evoked the loft spaces where many artists were
then working. Its raw, cavernous interior had a grandeur that seemed
comforting and accessible.</TE>
<TE>   "Downtown was a very underground scene then," recalls artist Roger
Herman, one of the first of these urban pioneers. "There were none of
the elegant lofts you see now. Artists were living in places like the
American Hotel [a former boardinghouse] paying very little rent.
There were a lot of punk concerts and performance art shows. Artists
were working on crazy stuff. One built these 'bum shelters' out of
molded plastic that a homeless person could sleep in. He scattered
them all around the area."</TE>
<TE>   By contrast, Grand Avenue was still struggling to live up to its
promise, and developers began promoting schemes to "humanize" the
street. The first of these, unveiled in 1980, was a proposal by
developers Robert Maguire and Jim Thomas that would have blended
commercial, retail and cultural buildings with a high dose of housing
on 11 acres of undeveloped land that later became California Plaza.
But the proposal never got off the ground. A more accurate expression
of the avenue's cultural identity was Isozaki's MOCA, whose partially
sunken plaza and underground galleries seemed to cringe under the
surrounding skyline of corporate towers.</TE>
<TE>   Soon after, most of the art scene fled back to the Westside, the
victim of economic downturn, a rise in the homeless population and
the inability of galleries to draw rich collectors to the inner city.</TE>
<TE>   The ideological split that divided the top and bottom of the hill
became etched into downtown's identity, and it only deepened over
time. When Mahony chose to move the cathedral from its Main Street
site to Grand and Temple, for example, many saw that as a sign of the
church's increasing detachment from the painful realities of everyday
life. St. Vibiana's, a Romanesque structure of little architectural
stature, stood at a symbolic crossroad between Little Tokyo, the
Latino shopping district of Broadway and skid row. The new cathedral,
more monumental in scale, aligned the church with the city's most
powerful cultural and civic institutions.</TE>
<TE>   Mahony initially planned to demolish the old cathedral, but the
L.A. Conservancy intervened, and in 1999 the property was sold to
developer Thomas Gilmore. Gilmore envisions the cathedral as a sort
of safe house for the cultural avant-garde--what the late Italian
leftist Antonio Gramsci once referred to as "enclaves of resistance."
The developer is negotiating with Cal State L.A. to transform the
cathedral's main space into a performing arts center, designed by
Brenda Levin &amp; Associates. The rectory, designed in 1933, would house
classrooms and a cafe, centered on an internal court.</TE>
<TE>   "We are toying with the idea of making the cathedral garden into a
place for an outdoor film series," Levin says, "like the plaza in
'Cinema Paradiso.' "</TE>
<TE>   But culture is only one component of Gilmore's scheme. The
developer is negotiating with the city to purchase an adjacent lot
along Main Street, where he hopes to build a new loft building. Just
to the east, the city is about to break ground on a new Little Tokyo
branch library, designed by A.J. Lumsden &amp; Associates.</TE>
<TE>   In effect, the complex would become a sort of social hinge,
linking Little Tokyo to the increasingly gentrified Latino shopping
district along Broadway. Gilmore, in fact, has already snatched up a
number of Beaux Arts buildings along 4th Street between Main and
Broadway, which he is transforming into lofts. He is also in the
process of restoring the Palace Theater, an ornately gilded 1920s-era
structure that is being used as an independent performance space.
Another developer, Steve Needleman, has recently completed a
$3-million restoration of the 1926 Orpheum Theatre.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the Los Angeles City Council set up a new 879-acre
development zone in and around downtown in May with the intent of
spurring new housing development. The plan would allow the Community
Redevelopment Agency to use local property taxes to create up to
12,900 residences over the next 45 years, some of which would be used
to house downtown's homeless population.</TE>
<TE>   "There's an anarchy here that I love," Gilmore says, surveying
Broadway from his office window above the Palace. "And I think that
will always be part of the scene here. The question is whether places
like Broadway will become Starbucks and Gaps. But I think the
[1-mile] strip of the street will prevent that from happening.
There'll always be room for variety."</TE>
<TE>   To architects, such talk suggests a rare opportunity--a chance to
reinvent the traditional urban model. Last year, the Southern
California Institute of Architecture moved from its more pristine
home near Marina del Rey to an abandoned 1907 freight depot near the
L.A. River. Since then, the school has sought to nurture its
relationship with local developers and politicians. Eric Owen Moss,
the school's recently appointed director, has inaugurated a series of
panel discussions on a variety of development plans. More recently,
the Metropolitan Transit Authority persuaded SCI-Arc's  Roger Sherman
to devote a yearlong class to study how best to develop the barren
parcel of land between Chinatown and the 101 Freeway. An urban
no-man's land, the four-block-long parcel is an opportunity to stitch
together a number of unrelated areas, including the Civic Center that
extends north from City Hall, Chinatown and Olvera Street. The
student proposal, still in the early stages, includes a retail
corridor, interspersed with cultural and educational institutions,
that would spill across the 101 Freeway and eventually link to
Broadway's shopping district.</TE>
<TE>   Moss, meanwhile, is working with Gilmore on a proposal for a
housing, office and retail complex that would stand on a large empty
lot across from SCI-Arc. At one end, a blob-shaped office block would
be sliced into four roughly equivalent segments to create an internal
court.</TE>
<TE>   At the other, a series of dramatically canted housing towers would
frame a grass lawn. The lawn would act as a dreamy, communal oasis
set off from the hard-edged city around it.</TE>
<TE>   Not to be outdone, Thom Mayne, one of the city's established
architectural luminaries, recently taught a two-year workshop at UCLA
on the future of downtown Los Angeles. The results have been
published in "L.A. Now." One of the book's most compelling proposals
calls for the creation of a series of interweaving bands--industrial
park, green space, pedestrian walkways and high-speed trains--that
would crisscross the L.A. River. The idea would be to break down the
psychological wall that divides downtown from the Latino communities
across the river in Boyle Heights.</TE>
<TE>   Such schemes are an attempt to come to terms with the deep
contradictions embodied in downtown's shifting identity. It is a
place haunted by historical memory and largely out of keeping with
the city's image as a place of suburban sprawl. Its communities,
despite their relatively strong identities, remain divided by rigid
social and physical boundaries.</TE>
<TE>   "The trick is to not give in to the typical development formulas,
to resist being co-opted just to get a job," SCI-Arc's Sherman says
of such proposals. "There's a possibility to develop something that
hasn't been seen before."</TE>
<TE>   Not all of these visions, however, are hypothetical academic
exercises. Mayne, for example, has landed two major commissions
downtown. His design for the Caltrans District 2 Headquarters
Building at 1st and Main streets--a slim, horizontal office block
sheathed in a shimmering skin of perforated metal--is under
construction. The other, a design for a new Children's Museum near
the Geffen Contemporary, is in the planning stages. Its bulbous,
anthropomorphic form, propped up at one end on slender, leg-like
columns, evokes the theoretical proposals of Archigram, a 1960s-era
British group that dreamed of building mechanized "Walking Cities" to
express society's increasingly nomadic existence.</TE>
<TE>   A few blocks away, an equally intriguing project is the proposed
$15-million renovation and addition for Little Tokyo's Japanese
American Cultural and Community Center. Designed by the celebrated
Japanese architect Toyo Ito, the plan calls for the creation of an
elevated terrace bridge that would connect the existing theater and
community center. A shimmering, cylindrical entry tower would lead up
to the bridge, its internal structure rising out of the landscape
like some otherworldly plant vine. The center has yet to launch its
capital campaign to pay for the addition.</TE>
<TE>   If they are built, projects like these would begin to give Little
Tokyo a more layered visual identity, one more rooted in the present
than a themed version of the past.</TE>
<TE>   This kind of gentrification, of course, can have negative
implications. Cultural types have long functioned as the spearhead
for real estate speculators. In the 1970s, for example, the largely
abandoned manufacturing buildings of New York's SoHo district,
nestled between Little Italy and Chinatown, became a haven for young
artists who cherished its large, open lofts and cheap rents. Soon,
SoHo's aura of bohemian chic attracted a slew of trendy hangers-on
and real estate speculators. Rents soared. Today, Little Italy is a
virtual theme park. And most artists have fled to more affordable,
outlying boroughs.</TE>
<TE>   Similarly, after the fall of the Berlin Wall, young artists
flocked to the Mitte district in the city's former eastern sector.
Within a few years, the artists and their East Berliner neighbors
were complaining about a yuppie invasion, and the buildings'
soot-covered, pockmarked facades were being sandblasted clean, their
ground floors gutted to make room for luxury boutiques.</TE>
<TE>   Such complaints recently erupted in downtown L.A., over a proposal
to create a cultural district around the Geffen Contemporary, which
would include a 3.3-acre Art Park between the proposed Children's
Museum and the Geffen Contemporary. Designed by Los Angeles architect
Michael Maltzan, the park is an attempt to address the scale both of
the city and of the local community. Rows of traditional Japanese
cherry trees, for example, would frame a pedestrian boulevard in
front of the Geffen. Just behind it, a sloping grass lawn would sweep
up into the air at one end, offering a distant view of the downtown
skyline.</TE>
<TE>   But local activists want to use the site to build a gymnasium for
a Japanese American basketball league. To them, the Art Park is
indicative of the city's willingness to place the values of outside
interests above those of the existing community. The invasion of
cultural institutions represents the erasure of history.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, L.A.'s downtown may be more resistant to that kind of
colonization. Unlike a traditional metropolis, it has no strong
gravitational pull. Its landscape, strewn with empty lots, remains
largely unformed. Many young artists who live downtown today will
probably leave once they reach middle age, lured by the dream of the
single-family home and suburbia's blend of man-made and natural
landscapes. Most new immigrants avoid the inner city entirely,
choosing to pursue the American dream in places like Torrance,
Pacoima and Little Saigon.</TE>
<TE>   As such, downtown may retain its counterculture ethos better than
that of other cities. The result could be a bohemia of the future, a
lasting community of competing ethnicities, students and urban
pioneers, an affordable place to live for self-fashioned outsiders.</TE>
<TE>   "Culture doesn't exist in a vacuum," says the Japanese community
center's chief executive, Cora Mirikitani, who is a supporter of the
Art Park plan. "It is a messy process. The question is how we
preserve the integrity of our cultural history and become a modern,
vital place.</TE>
<TE>   "Downtown is also about rethinking what L.A. can be, which is a
diverse cultural center."</TE>
<TE>   It is exactly that complex, human dimension that Grand Avenue's
backers are trying to achieve. To some degree, their efforts are
paying off. An important feature of Disney Hall, for example, is its
ability to embrace its immediate surroundings. The glass-enclosed
lobby is intended to draw the street's energy directly into the
building. Above, the facade's exuberant forms sweep down toward the
sidewalk in a conscious attempt to bridge the gap between the hall's
heroic scale and the scale of the solitary individual. Those forms
echo the curved exterior of the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion across 1st
Street, a gesture that makes the pavilion seem more graceful.</TE>
<TE>   Similarly, the abstract, monumental form of Moneo's cathedral is
anchored by a vast public plaza. The plaza's aim is to provide the
kind of communal glue that downtown so sorely lacks.</TE>
<TE>   But architecture, on its own, cannot reverse a half-century of
cynical or misguided urban planning projects. Nor can two buildings,
however well-conceived, knit together an entire segment of a city.</TE>
<TE>   At Grand Avenue, that task has mainly been left to the Grand
Avenue Committee, a coalition of developers, Music Center board
members and local stakeholders led by Broad and Thomas. Earlier this
year, the committee hired A.C. Martin &amp; Associates to develop
guidelines for the site, which would include office and residential
towers, cinemas, restaurants and bars set along the avenue on two
large county-owned parcels facing Disney Hall and two city-owned
parcels just to its south. A 20-acre park would extend east down
Bunker Hill from the Music Center Plaza to City Hall, replacing the
existing Civic Center Mall.</TE>
<TE>   The committee is negotiating with the county and city to create a
"joint powers" agreement that would allow it to oversee the entire
site. It then plans to seek out a team of investors that would submit
more detailed proposals for the various buildings along the avenue.
The entire cost of the project would be about $1.2 billion. About
$300 million would be paid for by public funds; the rest would come
from the development group.</TE>
<TE>   The plan is the latest in a number of efforts to humanize Bunker
Hill. Its cinemas and restaurants are intended to transform the
avenue into a late-night destination point. The park is the kind of
generous public gesture that could serve as a social mixing zone for
the area's various communities. Flanked by county buildings on either
side and punctuated by City Hall, it would also give the Civic Center
a formal elegance. "The key is to get people down there," Broad says
during an interview at his Richard Meier-designed beach house in
Malibu. "And then you want them to stay and you want them to spend
money. And for that, you need people to feel safe."</TE>
<TE>   But in other ways, the plan's enormous scale is in keeping with
the kind of conventional planning formulas that have become the norm
among developers. Broad often compares the proposal to standard
retail-entertainment complexes like San Francisco's Metreon or New
York's South Street Seaport. Though the Grand Avenue plan would
include housing, such complexes are generic consumption machines that
may be packed with out-of-town tourists but add little to the city's
civic life. In a broader sense, the new Grand Avenue is an extension
of the retail-entertainment development already being planned for the
area around Staples Center. In that plan, a 7,000-seat theater and
several blocks of retail shops would face Staples across a large
plaza, creating a themed, CityWalk-like experience that is only
slightly more open to the surrounding urban fabric.</TE>
<TE>   The highbrow arts corridor and the lowbrow sports oasis
essentially form two anchors of the same vision of downtown, with the
business district loosely strung out over 1.2 miles between them.
"The city is the locus of the collective memory," the late Italian
architect Aldo Rossi once wrote. "They are great encampments of the
living and the dead where a few elements remain like signals,
symbols, warnings."</TE>
<TE>   Grand Avenue, too, has become a place of memory. Its buildings
embody a range of contrary values, from the utopian to the sinister.
They include the corporate paranoia of its towers, the messy
democratic idealism of Disney Hall and the cathedral's atavistic
spiritualism. It is the tension between such visions that begins to
give the avenue its identity.</TE>
<TE>   The rest of downtown, meanwhile, may flourish out of necessity.
The central city population has already increased 12.7% between 1990
and 2000 to 25,208. Los Angeles County's population is expected to
grow by about 1 million during the next decade. The city is becoming
more dense, more urban. Areas that were once thought of as irrelevant
dead zones--as Banham claimed of downtown--will necessarily fill up.</TE>
<TE>   For Grand Avenue to succeed, it will have to become more than an
isolated urban fragment. It will have to tap into that life force at
the bottom of the hill. It is here that the cycles of death and
renewal are taking place, as older communities begin to wither and
new ones take their place.</TE>
<TE>   And it is here that the subtler, less visible patterns of daily
life are apt to be played out. The blending of these two worlds--one
symbolic, the other real--could finally make downtown something it
has never been: a relevant piece of Los Angeles' deepening cultural
matrix.</TE>

<HD>Suge Knight Gets Back in the Game With New Players</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE HOCHMAN</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Four years in prison did little to diminish the legacy of Marion
"Suge" Knight, whose Death Row Records label was ground zero for West
Coast rap in the '90s. It was home to Dr. Dre, Snoop Dogg and 2Pac as
they shaped a generation of urban music.</LD>
<LD>   One year after being released from prison, Knight is officially
putting that legacy on the line with the first album from his new
label, Tha Row. "Say Hi to the Bad Guy," the debut album by Long
Beach rapper Crooked I, is due Sept. 24, and Knight has a roster of
other acts ready to roll out, including a posthumous album from TLC
member Lisa "Left Eye" Lopes in October.</LD>
<LD>   Leading off is a pressure position for new artist Crooked I.</LD>
<TE>   "Some artists may not have wanted to be the first," says the
rapper, 26. "2Pac alone sold something like 30 million albums on
Death Row. Some people are scared of that. But I'm ready to step into
the pressure. If I was Kobe [Bryant], I want to hit that last shot to
win the game. I'm up to the challenge."</TE>
<TE>   Crooked I and Knight started work on the album when Knight was
released last August from Sheridan Federal Correctional Institution
in Oregon. He was there for violation of probation for previous
assault charges. From the start, they had a mission.</TE>
<TE>   "We wanted to restore the feeling that was missing from West Coast
rap," Crooked says. "It's like our sound was locked up with Suge."</TE>
<TE>   One song, "So Damn Hood," is already getting a lot of play at
hip-hop station KPWR-FM (105.9) and shows roots in the classic West
Coast sound, with a hard beat and stern attitude. But it also
displays the artist's distinctive flair for rhyme and structure.</TE>
<TE>   Knight says that it's not just a matter of a sound, but an
attitude that he feels is missing in the current climate.</TE>
<TE>   "No one's having fun in the music business," he says. "You can
hear it in the tracks. You get an album with just one or two good
songs now. There's so much tension. We're having fun, we're happy.
We're not doing this album just to make money, but doing it for the
community--get a new artist and take over, keep the little kids'
hopes alive so they say, 'I can do it.' It's not the same guy doing
the same rap for the last 10 years."</TE>
<TE>   At the very least, Tha Row comes with street credibility, says
Alan Light, former editor in chief of Vibe magazine and rock monthly
Spin.</TE>
<TE>   "It's enough to get you noticed," Light says, but adds, "It's been
a long time since Suge was releasing hits with notable frequency.
There's no arguing that whether it was Suge or Dre or the combination
that they identified a feel and sound for that time. The question is
can they do that over longer stretches of time." A more delicate
matter may be the Lopes album, under the project name N.I.N.A. (A TLC
album she had been working on at the time of her death last April is
expected to come later from Arista Records.)</TE>
<TE>   "There's a whole lot of emotion involved with it," Knight says.
"When the tragedy first happened, I didn't want to put the record
out. I didn't want to be looked at as just trying to make money."</TE>
<TE>   But Knight says he consulted with Lopes' family and is making
plans to donate some of the proceeds to community projects in the
Honduras tha Lopes supported. "I know the one thing she wanted was
the solo album," Knight says.</TE>
<TE>   CASTING CALL: Many rock fans know about Cynthia Plaster Caster,
the former groupie who with a few cohorts is responsible for one of
rock's most intriguing and notorious memorabilia collections--images
of rock stars' anatomy cast in, well, plaster. KISS even did a song
about it in the '70s.</TE>
<TE>   But starting today, rock fans will have the opportunity to own
pieces of this history. Drawing on her collection of more than 50
casts of male genitalia (subjects ranging from Jimi Hendrix to Jello
Biafra) and a recent series of female breasts (Peaches, Stereolab's
Letitia Sadier), the artist will be selling limited-edition
reproductions and related drawings on a new Web site, www.cynthia
pcaster.org. Most of the proceeds will go to her Cynthia Plaster
Caster Foundation, a not-for-profit venture.</TE>
<TE>   "My motivation is to help needy artists, musicians and filmmakers
like myself, people who have great ideas for projects but not the
bucks," says Chicagoan Plaster Caster, whose real name is Cynthia
Albritton.</TE>
<TE>   The replicas will be sold individually (starting at $750) and in
groupings, such as guitarists.</TE>
<TE>   Plaster Caster had been looking for a suitable way to sell
reproductions since winning possession of the collection in a 1994
lawsuit against former Frank Zappa manager Herb Cohen, who had
custody since the early '70s. Now she's recruiting new "castees" to
help with the venture.</TE>
<TE>   "I will never retire," she says. "As long as there are talented
people who have appendages, I'm there."</TE>
<TE>   SPECTOR VECTOR: When English band Starsailor played at the Palace
in Hollywood last fall, the group went home with a surprising
souvenir--an invitation to work with producer Phil Spector, who
attended the show and liked what he heard. But given that the
notoriously reclusive creator of the '60s "wall of sound" style
hasn't produced a full album since the Ramones' 1980 "End of the
Century," the band was not counting on anything happening.</TE>
<TE>   A few weeks ago, though, Spector flew to England at his own cost
and spent five days with the band, producing two new songs. And now,
with the band holding London's Abbey Road Studios for November to
finish its second album, Spector is in discussions to possibly
produce the whole project.</TE>
<TE>   SMALL FACES: Christina Aguilera, 'N Sync, Usher, Aaron Carter, the
Baha Men, Smash Mouth, Jessica Simpson and the A*Teens have all
contributed to "Disneymania," an album of Disney songs due Sept. 17
from Walt Disney Records. A TV special is being planned for the
fall.... On a similar note, "For the Kids," an album benefiting VH1's
Save the Music education and equipment efforts, is due Oct. 22 from
Nettwerk Records. Among those performing children's songs are Tom
Waits, Sarah McLachlan, Five for Fighting and Remy Zero ....</TE>
<TE>   English band Idlewild scored a coup with director Wim Wenders
signing on to direct a video for the song "Live in a Hiding Place"
from the album "The Remote Part," just released in the U.K. and due
here in early 2003. The video was being shot last week in a western
setting at the Melody Ranch in Newhall. Wenders, whose film credits
include "Paris, Texas" and the documentary "The Buena Vista Social
Club," has directed just a handful of rock videos, including clips
for U2 and the Eels.</TE>

The scene-setting interviews and TV appearances are out of the way,

1999, returns for two performances this week. Tuesday, Dmitri Liss
conducts an all-orchestral program that includes a suite from
Tchaikovsky's "Swan Lake" ballet and one from Stravinsky's "The
Firebird." Two Russian opera stars, soprano Galina Gorchakova and
baritone Sergei Leiferkus, appear Thursday on an operatic program
conducted by Alexander Vedernikov.</TE>
<TE>   Dance</TE>
<TE>   Music from north India and classical dances from the south of that
enormous, culturally diverse nation come together tonight in "Yatra:
A Journey to India" at the Watercourt in downtown L.A.'s California
Plaza. Award-winning dancer-choreographer Ramaa Bharadvaj brings her
Angahara Ensemble and Mala Ganguly's Ragamala Music Ensemble together
for this event in the free "Grand Performances" summer series.</TE>
<TE>   Jazz</TE>
<TE>   The 82-year-old pianist-composer Dave Brubeck stops at the
Cerritos Center for the Performing Arts for a concert Monday evening.
The legendary jazz performer is probably best known for his 1959
recording of "Take Five," the first million-selling jazz record.</TE>
<TE>   Video</TE>
<TE>   Two of England's best actors--Judi Dench and Jim Broadbent--give
powerhouse performances in "Iris," a subtle, effective drama about
the romance between novelist Iris Murdoch and her husband, John
Bayley, from their early student days through her battle with
Alzheimer's. Broadbent won an Oscar for best supporting actor. Also
nominated for Oscars were Dench and Kate Winslet, as the young
Murdoch. The film, directed by Richard Eyre, arrives Tuesday on VHS
and DVD.</TE>

<LD>   MANA</LD>
<LD>   "Revolucion de Amor"</LD>
<TE>   Warner Bros.</TE>
<TE>   You have to admire a band--a Mexican one especially--that uses
revolutionary slogans as lyrics and still sells millions. Mana sings
about racism, pollution and violence, and makes it sound fun.</TE>
<TE>   In its first studio album in five years (due in stores Tuesday),
the Guadalajara-based quartet continues its Latin/rock fusion, a la
Carlos Santana, with whom the band recorded 1999's "Corazon
Espinado." Santana returns the favor here with a plaintive guitar
solo on the opening track, "Justicia, Tierra y Libertad" (Justice,
Land and Liberty). Singer Ruben Blades also does an arresting guest
vocal on the aching "Sabanas Frias" (Cold Sheets).</TE>
<TE>   Too often, though, the band's message bombs with the simplistic
thud of adolescent idealism. In "Fe" (Faith), singer Alex "El Animal"
Gonzalez bemoans the human condition: "I can't understand how this
world can be this way/That someone could hate, hurt and betray/Why?"</TE>
<TE>   And it's no more poetic in Spanish.</TE>
<TE>   In another tune, "Pobre Juan" (Poor Juan), a ballad about an
immigrant's death at the border, a mournful harmonica evokes Bob
Dylan. But it also invites comparison with Dylan's "I Pity the Poor
Immigrant," far superior to this routine tale of woe.</TE>
<TE>   That said, Mana's unabashed innocence can be captivating. And so
can its smooth musicianship and abundant pop appeal.</TE>
<TE>   Agustin Gurza</TE>
<TE>   *** 1/2</TE>
<TE>   SPOON</TE>
<TE>   "Kill the Moonlight"</TE>
<TE>   Merge</TE>
<TE>   Britt Daniel again shows that propulsive rock songs don't have to
sound big. On the Austin, Texas, band's fourth album (due Tuesday),
frontman Daniel discharges tense gems that all ought to be stamped
"urgent," if they'd stand still long enough.</TE>
<TE>   Those lean and inventive rhythms emerge from the sparest of
guitar-bass-keyboard-drum environments. On one number, "Stay Don't
Go," breathy grunts are looped to form a human beat box, while
Daniel's stuttery vocals, which range from Doorsy on "Small Stakes"
to Stonesy on "Don't Let It Get You Down," are just prominent enough
to be your conscience.</TE>
<TE>   Spoon even manages to match the intensity of 2001's "Girls Can
Tell," which featured the indie classic "Fitted Shirt"--a song catchy
by fits and starts, with smart lyrics and a metaphor to boot. On
"Moonlight," Daniel remembers "Jonathon Fisk," the bully who, while
acknowledging his sin, whupped him on the way home from school. To
him, Daniel writes, "religion don't mean a thing/It's just another
way to be right wing."</TE>
<TE>   Kevin Bronson</TE>
<TE>   ** 1/2</TE>
<TE>   SLEATER-KINNEY</TE>
<TE>   "One Beat"</TE>
<TE>   Kill Rock Stars</TE>
<TE>   After five albums, this grrrl-powered Pacific Northwest trio still
gets a lot of mileage out of how it reinvented rock to suit its own
feminist-indie ideals. But is it really reinvention if a good portion
of your sixth album (due Tuesday) recalls "The Scream"-era Siouxsie &amp;
the Banshees?</TE>
<TE>   Well, kinda. Following the streamlined, angular punk of 2000's
"All Hands on the Bad One," singer-guitarists Corin Tucker and Carrie
Brownstein and drummer Janet Weiss broaden their sonic vocabulary
with new wave and soul elements. After all, we expect protest tunes
from S-K, but not with a distinctly Motown beat, as on the
people-get-ready number "Step Aside."</TE>
<TE>   Tucker and Brownstein apply their trademark vocal and instrumental
back-and-forth to such subjects as the lock-step state of the union
("Combat Rock"), 9/11 ("Far Away"), heartbreak ("Funeral Song") and
the tale of a rock-liberated bookworm ("Prisstina," featuring their
first male guest vocalist, Stephen Trask of "Hedwig" fame). Still,
although the warped pop of the Go-Go's-esque "Oh!" is giddy fun, it's
slightly disappointing that S-K has picked up the whole '80s
synth-pop thang. Just like--sob!--so many other bands.</TE>
<TE>   The group's singular, piercing-wail urgency still vividly captures
personal and political upheaval, but the chewed-up/spit-out message
of "Hollywood Ending" is just tired. And the bluesy "Sympathy," an
agonized prayer for a baby's life, favors the artlessly maudlin over
the righteously direct. Sleater-Kinney plays next Sunday at the
Sunset Junction festival in Silver Lake.</TE>
<TE>   Natalie Nichols</TE>
<TE>   ** 1/2</TE>
<TE>   FRANK BLACK</TE>
<TE>   &amp; THE CATHOLICS</TE>
<TE>   "Black Letter Days" and</TE>
<TE>   "Devil's Workshop"</TE>
<TE>   spinART</TE>
<TE>   Ex-Pixies mastermind Frank Black has a bad case of white line
fever, and he needs to let his music catch up with his runaway
lyrical talent. The Little Tokyo sessions for "Black Letter Days"
stretched on to 17 songs, so he adjourned to a North Hollywood space
and laid down 11 more for "Devil's Workshop." Now he's recording
more. Somebody stop him!</TE>
<TE>   Despite auspicious beginnings on "Black Letter Days" (both albums
come out Tuesday), there's barely enough here for one satisfying
album. The opening version of Tom Waits' "The Black Rider" is classic
Pixies-era punk: lyrically deranged, with a screaming chorus and
urgent, chiming guitars. Track two, "California Bound," strums to a
great run-on lyric that builds to a dark promise of salvation.</TE>
<TE>   The rest of these well-written poems of heartbreak, death,
workaday ennui and goodbyes, however, drift from Jonathan
Richman-style girlfriend songs to a plaintive, pedal-steel-inflected,
early-'70s Stones/Gram Parsons feel, especially "The Farewell Bend"
and "Southbound Bevy."</TE>
<TE>   The strange, astonishing twists of fate, passion and song
structure of even the first two Catholics albums are absent--except
on "1826," which starts out as Roky Erickson and ends as Black Oak
Arkansas. "Devil's Workshop" continues with more of the same, closing
with one of the strongest songs on either disc, "Fields of Marigold,"
a heavy guitar goodbye. Is there anything as good as "This Monkey's
Gone to Heaven" or "Here Comes Your Man"? No there is not.</TE>
<TE>   But with time and editing, there could have been.</TE>
<TE>   Dean Kuipers</TE>
<TE>   ***</TE>
<TE>   NICKEL CREEK</TE>
<TE>   "This Side"</TE>
<TE>   Sugar Hill</TE>
<TE>   This fresh-faced San Diego trio hasn't been intimidated by the
surprise success of its debut album, 2000's "Nickel Creek," which has
sold 640,000 copies to date, phenomenal in the folk-bluegrass world
it came from.</TE>
<TE>   The approach on this follow-up is even more ambitious, as the
threesome and returning producer Alison Krauss poke, punch and kick
with all their might at the boundaries of acoustic music.</TE>
<TE>   You might even call what mandolinist Chris Thile, fiddler Sara
Watkins and her guitarist-brother, Chris Watkins, do on their
sophomore album "ambi-grass." The ambience they create with various
instrumental textures is as important as what's in the song's lyrics,
most written by one or the other of the three and a variety of
co-writers. Thile, especially, is showing greater reach and
confidence in evoking emotion, often with excruciating subtlety.</TE>
<TE>   Despite many differences with their musical forebears, they
haven't lost the "blue" in bluegrass. Love is elusive and life is
hard, two truths that go straight back to bluegrass patriarch Bill
Monroe and the ancient mountain folk who preceded him.</TE>
<TE>   Randy Lewis</TE>
<TE>   In Brief</TE>
<TE>   *** Plankton Man and Terrestre, "Plankton Man vs. Terrestre,"
Lakeshore. This battle of the bands, Nortec-style, might not include
the Tijuana collective's brightest star, Bostich, but both Terrestre
and Plankton Man do a fine job of expanding the group's trademark
fusion of liquid electronica and quirky norteno samples. The
artificial samba beat and jazzy flute solos on "California 70" show
that success has not spoiled Nortec's effervescent sense of humor.</TE>
<TE>   Ernesto Lechner</TE>
<TE>   *** Clipse, "Lord Willin'," Star Trak/Arista. After cranking out
hits for Britney Spears, Jay-Z, Usher and a host of others over the
last few years, the producing team the Neptunes put their beat-making
prowess to the test by kicking off their own label with the debut
album (due Tuesday) from the Virginia rap duo of Pusha T and Malice.
The results are blissful, as the body-rocking, futuristic beats mesh
magically with the clever, straightforward rapping of the two MCs,
who inject sly humor and hard-core boasting into nearly every lyric.</TE>

<HD>Bracing Work That Gives New Meaning to the Word 'Quintet'</HD>

<LD>****</LD>
<LD>   GREG OSBY</LD>
<LD>   "Inner Circle"</LD>
<TE>   Blue Note</TE>
<TE>   In the best recording of his career, alto saxophonist Osby leads
an acoustic band in music that proves brashly original yet utterly
accessible and alluring. Those who admire Osby for the famously
keening quality of his tone on alto saxophone will be struck by how
vividly it stands out against the mighty block chords of pianist
Jason Moran and the intricate melodic flourishes of vibist Stefon
Harris. Although in many instances these artists might seem to be
playing harmonic and rhythmic figures that clash with one another, in
fact they're simply building ensemble sound in unconventional ways
(with elegant support from bassist Taurus Mateen and drummer Eric
Harland). The music that results is so fresh, bracing and
unpredictable that it forces the listener to reconsider the meaning
and purpose of a jazz quintet. And just when Osby's band seems to be
pushing into somewhat rarefied terrain, the players produce the
searing, thoroughly disarming lyricism of a cut such as "All Neon
Like." Come December, this recording likely will be turning up on
year's best lists across the country--it's clearly a milestone for an
already important musician.</TE>
<TE>   *** 1/2</TE>
<TE>   CARL SAUNDERS</TE>
<TE>   "Be Bop Big Band"</TE>
<TE>   Sea Breeze Jazz</TE>
<TE>   The big-band era may be over, but don't tell that to America's
jazz musicians, who not only are churning out important new
recordings for large ensemble but redefining the genre. The latest
example comes from veteran Los Angeles trumpeter-bandleader Saunders,
who presides over a nimble big band in arrangements by such
formidable writers as Herb Phillips and John Boice. The rhythmic
accuracy that these players achieve on Saunders' "Compilation," the
deeply burnished tone that the brass and reed choirs produce on Ivan
Lins' "Love Dance," and the new life that the ensemble breathes into
Johnny Mandel and Johnny Mercer's venerable "Emily" attest to the
enduring power and potential of the big-band idiom. Then there are
Saunders' solos, which are equally persuasive whether he's playing
fleet passages in the stratospheric range of his trumpet or coaxing
long, silken lines from his fluegelhorn.</TE>
<TE>   *** 1/2</TE>
<TE>   FRED ANDERSON</TE>
<TE>   "On the Run:</TE>
<TE>   Live at the Velvet Lounge"</TE>
<TE>   Delmark Records</TE>
<TE>   There's a fine line between hard-core bebop and free jazz, but few
tenor saxophonists walk it as skillfully as Anderson. Although the
septuagenarian reedist came of age when bebop was king, he has
evolved through the decades, not only keeping pace with developments
in experimental jazz, but also helping to invent them. This
remarkably effective recording captures Anderson in particularly
strong form, perhaps because he was inspired to play before an
appreciative audience in his club, the Velvet Lounge, on Chicago's
South Side. Throughout, Anderson produces the blues-tinged lines and
tough, sinewy tone that are his signature. It takes a lifetime to
learn to construct a solo that's as succinct yet stylistically
free-ranging as Anderson's opening cut, "Ladies in Love." When
Anderson teams with bassist Tatsu Aoki and drummer Hamid Drake, the
saxophonist sounds all the more impressive, his relentlessly repeated
riffs and crying blues phrases brilliantly punctuated by Aoki's
running lines and Drake's explosive percussion.</TE>
<TE>   ***</TE>
<TE>   VICTOR FIELDS</TE>
<TE>   "52nd Street"</TE>
<TE>   Regina Records</TE>
<TE>   With his newest release, Oakland-based Fields shows that he's
maturing into a potentially significant vocal stylist. Blessed with
an unusually gauzy tenor, he offers unorthodox interpretations of
well-worn fare. Certainly few male vocalists have created as haunting
and ethereal an account of Thelonious Monk's " 'Round Midnight,"
while Fields' version of Dizzy Gillespie's "A Night in Tunisia"
offers an uncommonly genteel sense of swing. Presumably attempting to
reach a wide spectrum of listeners, Fields is joined on several
tracks by guest artists, though to varying degrees of success. If his
collaboration with saxophonist Gerald Albright on "And I Love Her"
leans too closely to commercial idioms, Fields' partnership with
vocalist Claudia Villela on "Bluesette" represents nearly ideal samba
singing.</TE>

<DH>A rash of new shows stresses the comedy in courtship
humiliation. Why do we watch this stuff?</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The five men seated in a small Mid-Wilshire office shot sideways
glances at one another. They didn't talk as they sized up their
rivals, and no one touched the complimentary lollipops and red vines
on the conference table. At one end of the room, a TV played old
"Blind Date" episodes.</LD>
<LD>   Most of them had waited several hours for their turn, and Nate
Taylor was getting antsy. His voice trembling a little, he asked that
someone change the channel.</LD>
<LD>   "I just don't need the intimidation factor right now," he said.</LD>
<TE>   Wearing khaki shorts, khaki shirt, sandals and a Panama hat, the
31-year-old Taylor, like the others in the room, had come to audition
to be a contestant on "Blind Date," the half-hour daily show that
turns dating miscues into punch lines.</TE>
<TE>   "I really have nothing to lose but my dignity," he said. "It's
almost self-destructive."</TE>
<TE>   Nearby, lifeguard Iman Alami exhibited less concern.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm good-looking, outgoing and fun," he said, in what could have
been a pitch to the show's recruiters. "I know they are going to try
to make a fool of me, but it's not going to happen."</TE>
<TE>   Still, mocking ordinary folk in their pursuit of romance is an
established--and increasingly widespread--television genre, as
producers reduce dating to a mix of comic fodder and blood sport.</TE>
<TE>   Dating shows have always been a staple of television, including
long-running franchises such as "The Dating Game" and "Love
Connection"--studio-based programs that featured contestants talking
to, and about, a potential match.</TE>
<TE>   By contrast, the new generation of dating shows relies on wireless
technology, lipstick-size cameras and other innovations that make it
possible to take dating out of the studio, allowing viewers to
voyeuristically ride along every step of the way.</TE>
<TE>   This summer has added several new wrinkles to a dating-show roster
already brimming with the syndicated "Blind Date," "Fifth Wheel,"
"Rendez-View" and "Elimidate," Fox's "Looking for Love: Bachelorettes
in Alaska" and the now-defunct "Temptation Island," as well as ABC's
surprise hit, "The Bachelor."</TE>
<TE>   The situations, however, invariably tilt toward the bizarre. NBC's
"Meet My Folks," for example, has parents strap their daughter's
potential suitors to a lie detector, and ask such embarrassing
questions as whether the lad got a friend drunk so he could have sex
with the friend's sister.</TE>
<TE>   "EX-treme Dating," meanwhile--being tested on a few local
stations, including KCOP in L.A.--has two women feeding information
to a third woman while she's on a date with their ex-boyfriend. They
watch the action on a monitor and talk to her through an earpiece
she's wearing.</TE>
<TE>   The producers concede that participating isn't for everyone.</TE>
<TE>   "It's one of those things you watch with the idea 'I'm glad that's
not me.' It is your worst nightmare," said Burt Wheeler, one of the
show's executive producers, adding that people can't help but
identify with the situations, "even though 90% of the world wouldn't
do it."</TE>
<TE>   Fortunately, most of the willing 10% seems to live in Los Angeles,
where there's no shortage of attractive singles eager to be on TV.</TE>
<TE>   With setups that virtually guarantee the humiliation of some
contestants--"Blind Date" uses irreverent animated thought-balloons
to lampoon them--these shows generally offer more train wrecks than
love connections. And the producers hope, plenty of knowing laughs.</TE>
<TE>   "We consider 'Blind Date' a comedy ... about interpersonal
relationships," said executive producer David Garfinkle. "We don't
want to be mean-spirited, but if someone's being a jerk, then we can
go ahead and bury them."</TE>
<TE>   For viewers such as Kristin Minter, a 36-year-old actress whose
credits include the series "ER," that's part of the appeal. She and
her friend Judy Dixon get together every Tuesday night for what Dixon
calls their weekly "sporting event," watching contestants being
humbled on "Blind Date."</TE>
<TE>   "You're rooting for people to fail," said Minter, who extracted
herself from the dating world after a series of disappointing
encounters. "The dating scene stinks. Most of the guys I've dated
couldn't pay for dinner, except one, and he was a drug addict."</TE>
<TE>   For Minter and Dixon, it's revenge by proxy.</TE>
<TE>   "You wish you could do that: Smack the guy and tell him what a
jerk he was," Minter said. To Dixon, a 36-year-old independent film
publicist, the show offers a "hyper-reality," reminding her why she's
watching dates rather than going on them.</TE>
<TE>   "When you're dating, you're so vulnerable," she said. "You wish
you could do those things they're doing on the shows, tell him,
'You're a loser' or 'I'm going home now,' " she said, citing one
favorite episode in which a female contestant abruptly left, taking
her dinner home in a to-go box.</TE>
<TE>   Shows like "EX-treme Dating" are geared toward a demographic
coveted by advertisers: 18-to 34-year-old women. But the bloodletting
appeals to men too.</TE>
<TE>   David Serby, a 38-year-old freelance writer, says he has watched
more than his share of "Blind Date," "Meet My Folks" and
"Rendez-View," and harbors little compassion for those involved.</TE>
<TE>   "It's like watching Jerry Springer," he said. "I don't think
they're interested in getting a date, they are interested in their 15
minutes of fame.... They don't want to pay their dues and do
community theater. They don't even have the talent to go on
'Survivor.' "</TE>
<TE>   In other words, contestants subjected to ridicule deserve what
they get.</TE>
<TE>   "I love to watch real people make [fools] of themselves," he said.
"It's this society's obsession with celebrity--people will do
anything to get on TV."</TE>
<TE>   In a narcissistic age, dating shows represent the ultimate
narcissist fantasy, said Armond Aserinsky, a Philadelphia clinical
psychologist who added that seeing others punished for their swollen
egos offers viewers a great deal of satisfaction.</TE>
<TE>   "We hire Mr. and Mrs. Ordinary, put them on camera--they're glad
to be there--and we beat them up," he said. "It's like the Roman
games. You're stupid enough to get in the cage with the lion, you're
going to get eaten. What did you think would happen?"</TE>
<TE>   Despite the unusual quirks and wrinkles dreamed up by TV
producers, people somehow manage to suspend disbelief long enough to
see themselves reflected in the shenanigans and even feel they're
learning from the heavily edited high jinks that ensue.</TE>
<TE>   Aserinsky, who teaches study groups on film and TV for
psychologists and psychiatrists, believe viewers identify with the
contestants--the next-door neighbor--but are also revolted by the
behavior they see on the shows.</TE>
<TE>   "You identify with them for a while, but you part company when
they get punished," he said. "Here's this guy who gets on TV for no
good reason. He has no talents. The only thing that's going to make
that OK is that he's reduced to a moron in front of you. He has to
pay a price so that now I don't have to envy him."</TE>
<TE>   At the "Blind Date" offices, the door to the audition room is
decorated with a poster advertising the show: "Real Dates, Real
Funny."</TE>
<TE>   Caroline Johnson questions contestants in front of a camera:
dating philosophies, strategies, dating likes and dislikes. "We do
want real people," Johnson said. "Outgoing and energetic."</TE>
<TE>   Johnson knows the drill. She was a "Blind Date" contestant before
being hired by the show. "It was fun--like being a star for the day,"
she said of the experience.</TE>
<TE>   Searching for their star for the day, freelance recruiters, paid
on commission, scour the city for contestants, chatting up strangers
to persuade them to audition. A white board in an adjoining office
charts the locales: Monday in Venice. Valley bars on Tuesday.
Thursdays on Sunset Boulevard. Weekends, Zuma Beach in Malibu.</TE>
<TE>   Wannabe contestants also come, unprompted, to open casting calls,
and many are armed with the head shots actors carry around with them.</TE>
<TE>   "This is L.A.," Johnson said with a shrug. "A lot of people are
models, actors, singers, and that's great." But, she added, the
number of people trying to get on the show to further an
entertainment career has dropped off since the beginning. Few people
associated with so-called reality TV have been able to parlay their
15 minutes into careers, although some, including "Survivor's"
Richard Hatch and Colleen Haskell, have prolonged their exposure by
appearing on "Entertainment Tonight" and in the movie "The Animal,"
respectively.</TE>
<TE>   In an effort to "keep it real," producers regularly recruit in
several cities nationwide.</TE>
<TE>   Still, if there is a common thread to these shows, it's their
compromised reality. All involve dating in a fabricated manner--while
asking participants not to notice, somehow, the cameras designed to
catch every idiotic line and awkward moment.</TE>
<TE>   "We're small, but we're definitely not invisible," said Grant
Axton, who has coordinated 348 dates for "Blind Date" this season,
the show's fourth. "We're trying to create ... the voyeuristic side
of a date."</TE>
<TE>   On any given day, the crew consists of five people: a producer,
camera operator, audio person, production assistant and grip.</TE>
<TE>   As a coordinating producer, Axton keeps track of the different
crews and helps scout locations--a job that, with the proliferation
of dating shows, is becoming increasingly difficult. On occasion, he
said, competing shows cross paths at local restaurants or bars where
they are taping. "You would think L.A. is bigger than that, but it
really isn't," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Condensing four dates into one, they shoot about eight hours of
the couple together, partly in an effort to make contestants relax
and forget about the cameras.</TE>
<TE>   Axton's job includes finding activities for the couples--changing
oil on a Harley-Davidson together, for example--to bring out their
personalities. Getting them out of their shells, he concedes, is not
that hard.</TE>
<TE>   "The type of people who are comfortable in a situation like this
... they'll be type-A personalities," he said. "I'm constantly
surprised what people will do on national TV. Every day."</TE>
<TE>   Of course, the typical American date is dinner and a movie, but
that makes for boring TV.</TE>
<TE>   "They're all incredibly contrived," said NBC Executive Vice
President Jeff Gaspin, whose hard-to-fit-on-a-business card list of
responsibilities includes oversight of "alternative" series,
specials, movies and program strategy.</TE>
<TE>   Nonetheless, dating shows "have always worked in one form or
another," he said, adding that people can still become involved in
the shows because "the emotions are real, even if they're set up in
contrived situations."</TE>
<TE>   NBC actually had another dating concept planned for this summer
that's now being held until next year. The show, "Love Shack," is
described as a competition in which a man and woman move into a
Southern California mansion "on a quest to find true love while
competing against each other to win a one-year lease on a California
beach house."</TE>
<TE>   Beyond the genre's enduring popularity, television's appetite for
dating shows is also explained by simple economics: The shows are
almost uniformly inexpensive, virtually guaranteeing an
ever-expanding menu of such programs.</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, when successful, they often appeal to younger
viewers--the kind soft-drink and fast-food marketers covet--who still
play the dating game and get drawn into the unreal "reality."</TE>
<TE>   To many, however, they remain a cultural oddity--another example
of how easily anyone with seemingly dubious judgment can obtain a few
minutes of fame. Aserinsky, the psychologist, said he watched
"Jeopardy!" for 20 years and "never found myself wondering why they
were on that game." Not so with the dating shows. "You have to laugh,
but it's really sort of pitiful," he said. "For this I bought a
high-definition TV?"</TE>

<HD>Roaming the Sonic World, Laptop in Hand</HD>
<DH>Composer Carl Stone turns digital sound bites into
compositions only he can perform</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOSEF WOODARD</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>SAN FRANCISCO</DL>
<LD>Composers generally fill their minds with basic creative questions:
What will the musical language be? What about its shape? How will it
go?</LD>
<LD>   For composer Carl Stone, who will perform with his trusty laptop
at the Schindler House sound. series on Saturday, those old questions
enter in, but his primary concern is data, and the streaming,
chopping-up and processing thereof. His basic musical language is
built from samples, the digital sound bites that become tiny
particles in ornate sonic mosaics.</LD>
<LD>   That alone wouldn't make him special in a world where digital
manipulation in art and media are ubiquitous. The difference is that
Stone's data-head music goes back more than 20 years, making the San
Francisco-based Los Angeles native a pioneer of sorts.</LD>
<TE>   Over a meal in a noisy restaurant in San Francisco last week,
Stone admits, "On one level, I feel like the trends and the fashions
of today have vindicated what I was doing 20 years ago. Maybe I'm a
little bit, I wouldn't say resentful, but I feel a little bit
overlooked from time to time, because I was doing that stuff" early
on.</TE>
<TE>   Still, he says, "technology now has made so much possible. I'm as
happy as a pig in manure about that. The field is getting better and
better."</TE>
<TE>   He should know. Stone has worked his way through various machinery
and evolving technology, from intricate tape-loop systems in the
early 1980s to his use of an expensive French digital delay unit, the
Publison DM89, along with turntables. That segued into relying on
MIDI, or Musical Instrument Digital Interface, with Mac desktops, and
finally a laptop, once Mac G3 technology afforded enough processing
power and programming flexibility.</TE>
<TE>   Whatever the mechanics, Stone's method has stayed the same. He
likes to appropriate existing musical source material to create new
textural worlds with splicing and looping fragments of sound. Over
the years, the vast materials list has included Mussorgsky's
"Pictures at an Exhibition," the Temptations' "My Girl," snippets by
Miles Davis and Jimi Hendrix, Indonesian music, and untold archives
of other found musical and sound data.</TE>
<TE>   By nature, he's a traveler, and after having been a frequent flier
to Japan over the years, where he found a receptive audience and an
agreeable culture, Stone has now become a part-time expatriate.</TE>
<TE>   Taking a post as professor in the School of Computer and Cognitive
Sciences at Chukyo University in Toyota, Japan, he spends eight
months of the year there and the rest in the States or touring the
world.</TE>
<TE>   In San Francisco, he lives in a comfortable two-story house in the
Mission District with ample room for his CD library, computer and
wire-filled work lab. The backyard has been converted by the Japanese
couple who stay during Stone's absences into a spartan, Zen-like
garden. Walking through the yard, Stone adds, half-seriously, "I may
add some tiki torches or something."</TE>
<TE>   The tranquillity of the space pointedly contrasts with the
forested backyards all around, as well as the clamor of the busy
street out the front door. A similar dichotomy could also refer to
Stone's music, at times chaotic and jampacked with data, but also
strangely contemplative and formal in design.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm comfortable with who I am," he says. "I don't know where it
fits in with music today, or yesterday or tomorrow. Music in the
laptop world tends to be kind of formless, or anti-form. Initially,
[my music] may appear to be casual or formless, because it's a weird
approach, but I'm also into classical form, in the broadest sense.
Maybe, in that way, I'm an old fuddy-duddy."</TE>
<TE>   Stone, 49, grew up in the San Fernando Valley and studied at
California Institute of the Arts in its formative days in the early
1970s. After graduating, he worked in L.A. as a composer, radio
programmer and co-director of the 1985 New Music America festival,
before moving north in 1993. He has since performed in his hometown
several times, but Saturday's appearance will present his first new
work here in two years.</TE>
<TE>   He sees the new "Nak Won," about to be released on CD, as a field
report from his experience as a long-term visitor in Japan. "My
conscious musical influence from Japan is zero, as far as I can
tell," he says.</TE>
<TE>   "But there must be a lot of unconscious, unquantifiable influence.
It's not the music, and it's not the culture, but it's just this
sound world that's so startling.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm convinced that Tokyo is the noisiest city in the world, in
terms of intentional noise--speaker projections, voices,
announcements, ding-dongs, bells.</TE>
<TE>   "I can speak the language, kind of, but not that well, so it's
still fairly abstract. To Japanese," he adds, the noise is "very
pedestrian. A salesperson barking on the corner, saying, 'Buy my
shrimp,' to them is boring, but to me, it's like wow."</TE>
<TE>   Stone traces his interest in offbeat music to his high school days
in the Valley.</TE>
<TE>   A rock keyboardist, the teenage Stone was drawn to the maverick
music of Terry Riley, Harry Partch, Captain Beefheart, and Soft
Machine, and was intrigued by the newly opened CalArts in Valencia.</TE>
<TE>   There, with mentors such as Morton Subotnick and James Tenney,
Stone delved into electronic music, abandoning keyboards for
circuitry.</TE>
<TE>   Important early inspirations included the early tape-loop work of
Steve Reich, Alvin Lucier's "I Am Sitting in a Room" and a live
performance of Philip Glass' "Music for Changing Parts."</TE>
<TE>   After years in the '70s spent creating "tape music"-- working with
such synthesizers as the then-cutting-edge Buchla in the CalArts lab,
then presenting the finished work on tape--Stone had an epiphany. He
wanted to unleash the performer within. "Something about tape music
kept you abstracted from your audience. I wanted a closer, reactive
relationship."</TE>
<TE>   He established himself as a composer-performer. He "plays" the
laptop. Inputting samples and then manipulating them, he immerses
himself in his instrument, the sound of which he can change every
time he samples something new and manipulates it via software he
personalizes as well.</TE>
<TE>   He compares his setup to Chopin's piano.</TE>
<TE>   "He knew it and he mastered it. He could speak it. He ate it and
drank it and slept it. That's kind of what I do. It's not just the
computer, but the software that I build around it."</TE>
<TE>   Laptops have logically become a common tool of choice for many
experimental musicians, who can tinker with sounds and sequences, all
with a highly flexible and portable box. Stone's music, however, is
unique. He doesn't create scores, and only Carl Stone can play a Carl
Stone work. There is a structure attached to a set of samples, and
that allows him to revisit his pieces, but each performance is at
heart an improvisation.</TE>
<TE>   To his mind, what sets him apart is the practice of sampling.</TE>
<TE>   "On some level, my music is very unfashionable--not because of the
laptop, but maybe because of musical grammar," Stone says. "Sampling
has become very unfashionable. In Japan, it's all music made from
air"--from the computer itself, he means--"clicks and pops and
glitches. It's all very electronic sounding.</TE>
<TE>   "I am a confirmed sample-holic," he says, "and I have not entered
into any 12-step program."</TE>
<TE>   It has earned him some good reviews: In the 1980s, the Village
Voice dubbed him "one of the best composers living today." Along the
way, though, Stone has built up his defenses about his borrowing
tendencies.</TE>
<TE>   "At face value, it's like Brahms doing variations on a theme by
Handel, which I think is a very cool idea," he says of his process.
"This is part of our whole classical tradition. Bach did that, and
Handel did that, and Brahms did that, and Berg did it.</TE>
<TE>   "But it's more than that." Instead of grabbing a musical theme, he
says, "it might be that I'm capturing the pitch contour. Another
time, I'm capturing the rhythm and separating it out. I might take
the production value of a beautifully produced rock record and
somehow fold it over onto Moroccan trance music, and then fuse that
onto the rhythm of a bebop piece by Thelonious Monk."</TE>
<TE>   As the artist in "the middle" of all the possibilities, Stone is
bent on making his music his way.</TE>
<TE>   "I keep a guarded eye on what's going on in music," he says. "Some
of it's really interesting and can be very stimulating and causes me
to rethink my direction. But some of it strikes me as being hip
today, gone tomorrow. That, to me, is a waste of time."</TE>

<LD>A month ago I had never heard of Solomon Burke ("His Legacy on the
Line," by Robert Hilburn," Aug. 11). Then a friend couldn't stop
talking about him, and KCRW started playing tracks from the new
record and I loved it. I was interested to see how he would do at the
House of Blues show, and, quite honestly, I was blown away. He has
that skill of drawing in the crowd in a way that so many younger
performers just never achieve. What was more amazing was the fact
that he commanded such attention while sitting for the entire
performance.</LD>
<LD>   I was so absorbed I didn't notice that he focused more on the
oldies. I was just happy to be in this wonderful talent's presence.
So I do have to disagree with Hilburn that a new fan brought in by
his new record may have been disappointed by the show. I think that
new and old fans alike enjoyed it immensely.</LD>

<TE>   I was thrilled to see Solomon Burke on the Aug. 11 cover. It's
about time. As a musician who has had the pleasure of working with
him on a few occasions, I have to add that he is also one of the
nicest, kindest entertainers I have ever met. I'm glad he is finally
getting his due.</TE>

<LD>"Artists and repertoire subject to change. No refunds or exchanges"
reads the fine print on the Los Angeles Opera advertisement on Page
49 in the Aug. 11 Calendar.</LD>
<LD>   I ask you, would you put down money on next year's car knowing
that the make, model and options would be subject to change, no
refunds or exchanges? I do not think so. So why buy tickets in
advance to the Los Angeles Opera? You have no choice of seating by
phone or mail order, so best seat is not an option. Indeed, because
they never really sell out, some of the best tickets are at the box
office the night of performance.</LD>

<LD>I'm a big fan of journalists. I was one, full-time for almost a
decade. However, as I'm presently a TV and film writer, I feel a
responsibility to correct the misimpression that writer James
Greenberg gave in "Actors Who Call 'Action' " (Aug. 11).</LD>
<LD>   He wrote, "The reality is actors know their way around a set
better than most, certainly better than screenwriters who spend much
of their day locked in a room."</LD>
<LD>   I don't know one screenwriter who hasn't worked on a film set.
Indeed, when I left journalism to become a TV and film writer, I
worked crew positions for four years on films such as "To Sleep With
Anger," "Fled," "Mo' Money" and "My Teacher's Wife" just to see how a
script worked on the floor.</LD>
<TE>   It took another two years for me to sell my first screenplay and
then get hired as a "Star Trek: Voyager" staff writer. Does Greenberg
truly imagine that a writer writes great scripts by staying locked in
a room, fantasizing he's the literary equivalent of Vin Diesel, fast
and furiously typing 24/7 so his scripts are cut and toned.</TE>
<TE>   I and every writer I know can tell you the responsibilities of
every crew position on a set, and have had contact with everyone from
the best boy to the Teamster drivers.</TE>
<TE>   Greenberg might also wish to take into consideration the fact that
directors must know real life firsthand to present it visually.</TE>
<TE>   Aside from the bigger-name writers, most of us need day jobs to
sustain us between writing gigs.</TE>
<TE>   Actors, due to their fame, often must lead a "reel" life compared
with the "real" life we writers enjoy. My writer friends have
marriages, their children's games to attend, their education to
provide for, family relationships and more that they could not attend
to if they were, as Greenberg describes, spending much of their days
locked in a room.</TE>
<TE>   My weekly non-writing time spent in my community and with children
provides me with insights and experiences that can be explored on the
small or the big screen.</TE>
<TE>   Before you criticize us unnecessarily in the future, Mr.
Greenberg, it would be noble of you (and I do consider journalism a
noble profession) to interview some of us. You'll find our doors
unlocked.</TE>

<LD>   In advance of our much-anticipated trip to Vegas, we booked
second-row center seats at about $100 apiece for Gans' show based on
Las Vegas newspaper coverage that bills him as "Entertainer of the

entertainment. Snippets of songs and banter with band buddies do not
a Las Vegas show make. Impersonations of obscure celebrities had us
stumped.</LD>

<LD>In Suzanne Muchnic's story about the artwork that will appear in
Cardinal Mahony's new cathedral ("Sacred Creations," Aug. 4), she
mentioned that Mahony's hand-picked "art consultant," Father Richard
Vosko had "worked on dozens of churches," but didn't say much about
how. Last January, I attended a slide-show presentation by Vosko at
my home parish, St. Charles Borromeo, in North Hollywood.</LD>
<LD>   Long before he was hired by Mahony, Vosko had already presided
over the destruction of dozens of church buildings with traditional
Catholic (and Protestant and Jewish) architecture. Much of what he
has done (I refuse to say "accomplished") is well-documented in a
book by a Catholic author who, unlike Vosko, is a certified
architect: "The Renovation Manipulation," by Michael Rose, which is
heartily recommended to any interested readers. Many of your
readers--regardless of faith--have probably visited and marveled at
the grandeur and beauty of the great cathedrals of Europe.</LD>
<LD>   Vosko's low regard for those masterpieces of art and architecture
should be the tipoff that he is not a reliable judge of which
religious art is great and which is, in his terms, "god-awful stuff."</LD>
<TE>   Many of the parishioners at St. Charles groaned loudly when they
viewed his slides of the modernized, soulless, stripped-down,
neo-Puritan meeting halls that were beautiful Catholic churches
before he got his hands on them.</TE>
<TE>   I, for one, am inclined to strongly agree with his statement:
"Churches have not been courting good artists."</TE>

<HD>Telecom Woes Shared Via Industry Party Line</HD>
<DH>Services: Phone company networks are intertwined in a
seamless unit, but with these complex connections comes a degree of
financial interdependence.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KAREN KAPLAN and JAMES S. GRANELLI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>To understand how the financial collapse of a single company such as
WorldCom Inc. can quickly ripple through the rest of the
telecommunications industry, consider the path of a single phone
call.</LD>
<LD>   At Fluor Corp., Eric Fullmer picks up the handset in his cubicle
on the second floor of the engineering and construction firm's Aliso
Viejo headquarters. He has just completed a plan for installing pipes
in a refinery Fluor is building in Venezuela, and he wants to discuss
it with colleagues in Caracas and in the Philippines.</LD>
<LD>   The call travels along the networks of at least five phone
companies. Each company along the route collects or pays fees for its
role in completing the circuit. Despite the complexities, the
connections are almost always made in a matter of seconds.</LD>
<TE>   "If I dial the right number, it's going to get through to them,"
said Fullmer, a software engineer. The 3-D computer design he has
created to illustrate his pipe-installation plan can be shared just
as easily. "If I hit the right sequence of keys, the data will be
sent."</TE>
<TE>   To its users, the worldwide network of copper wires and
fiber-optic cables functions as a nearly seamless unit that allows
the sound of a caller's voice to travel to the recipient's ear in a
matter of milliseconds. The journey for data transmissions can take a
little longer, though it is usually measured in just seconds.</TE>
<TE>   Along those wires and cables, however, are a complicated series of
routes and transfer points connecting scores of networks of different
shapes and sizes. Many of those transfer points act as electronic
tollbooths keeping track of tiny charges--fractions of a cent--that
accrue each time a call switches networks.</TE>
<TE>   There are traditional long-distance networks operated by AT&amp;T
Corp., WorldCom and Sprint Corp. and traditional local phone networks
run by the likes of SBC Communications Inc., Verizon Communications
Inc., BellSouth Corp. and Qwest Communications International Inc.
There are next-generation networks built during the 1990s telecom
boom by upstarts such as Level 3 Communications Inc. and Williams
Communications Group Inc. And there are networks connecting
continents via cables laid beneath the ocean floor by companies such
as Global Crossing Ltd.</TE>
<TE>   Most calls traveling even a moderate distance change networks at
least once. A typical call from Los Angeles to New York changes
networks at least twice. Some carriers lease lines from other
carriers to fill gaps in their networks, adding another layer of
complexity.</TE>
<TE>   The reason for the transfers is simple logistics.</TE>
<TE>   "All telecom companies buy from each other because nobody goes
everywhere," said Todd Braning, a manager in Level 3's Internet
services group.</TE>
<TE>   But with all that interconnectedness comes a considerable degree
of financial interdependency. So with dozens of phone companies in
critical financial health, the telecom flu could spread throughout
the industry if companies can't collect the billions of dollars in
access fees they charge every year.</TE>
<TE>   "Normally, telephone firms do business with a bit of a float in
payables and receivables--a hundred million here or there does not
matter, if everyone gets paid eventually," said Shane Greenstein, an
associate professor at Northwestern University's Kellogg Graduate
School of Management who studies telecommunications networks.</TE>
<TE>   "If they happen to get into a cash crunch, then it would be real
trouble for them and their business partners," Greenstein said. "So
far, there is no sign that we are close to that, but that is the
concern to worry about."</TE>
<TE>   In the bankruptcy cases of WorldCom and Global Crossing, for
instance, hundreds of local telephone companies--from tiny firms in
Iowa and Montana to Baby Bells such as Pacific Bell parent SBC--have
sought upfront payments for connecting their customers to the
troubled long-distance carriers. SBC told a federal bankruptcy judge
in New York that WorldCom's MCI long-distance unit owes it more than
$300 million, with that amount climbing by about $150 million a
month.</TE>
<TE>   Generally, bankruptcy judges deny such requests because the
companies in bankruptcy proceedings would collapse without the
connections.</TE>
<TE>   Direct Route</TE>
<TE>   The path a call takes could be as direct as a nonstop flight from
Los Angeles International Airport to Boston's Logan International
Airport, or as meandering as a Southwest Airlines route that zigzags
the country, making multiple stops en route to its final destination.</TE>
<TE>   Like a cross-country trip, a residential long-distance phone call
begins at home. In Los Angeles, the first transfer point is a few
hundred yards away at a Pacific Bell central office, where a huge
switch routes calls.</TE>
<TE>   Signaling equipment tells the switch which long-distance carrier
each customer uses. That switch also is a metering and billing
device, keeping track of the minutes spent on the line and the fees
the long-distance company must pay.</TE>
<TE>   The call is then transferred to a switch belonging to AT&amp;T, MCI,
Sprint or another designated carrier. From there, the call travels
over the long-distance network to Boston, where it goes to the
Verizon central office closest to the house at which the phone will
ring. A few hundred yards later, the circuit is complete.</TE>
<TE>   The long-distance company bills the caller--the average rate
nationwide was 9 cents a minute in 2000, the most recent data
available from the Federal Communication Commission--and then uses
some of that revenue to pay PacBell and Verizon for their roles in
originating and terminating the call. The average charge in the U.S.
for originating a call is 0.9 of a cent a minute, while the average
charge for terminating a call is 0.78 of a cent a minute, the FCC
said.</TE>
<TE>   The fees are small, but the money adds up over the nearly 360
billion minutes of interstate calls made each year.</TE>
<TE>   International Service</TE>
<TE>   The big carriers have built their own nationwide long-distance
networks, and their calls usually don't stray from their own lines
except to link up with local networks. Some smaller long-distance
firms lease some or all of their lines from other carriers, and their
calls may travel a less-direct route. They also end up with another
set of bills to pay.</TE>
<TE>   An international call from the U.S. involves several more steps.
When the call reaches the U.S. border, it travels via an undersea
cable or a satellite link to a long-distance company in the
destination country, which then hands it off to a local phone
company. Rates for handling international calls are negotiated by the
phone companies.</TE>
<TE>   Long-distance calls made by businesses work essentially the same
way, though businesses typically have more choices than residential
customers. It is easier for them to bypass their traditional local
phone company by using a so-called competitive local exchange
carrier, or CLEC, such as IDT Corp. subsidiary Winstar Communications
or McLeodUSA Inc.</TE>
<TE>   Large businesses such as Fluor also can build their own private
networks to carry calls and data along heavily traveled routes.</TE>
<TE>   Data transmissions on the Internet are significantly more
haphazard. When Fullmer, the Fluor engineer, sends an e-mail to
someone outside the company, it goes to one of the company's Internet
service providers, such as WorldCom's UUNet unit.</TE>
<TE>   Sorting the E-Mail</TE>
<TE>   E-mails get broken up into packets of data, each one stamped with
the destination address and a tag indicating where it belongs when
the message is reassembled on the recipient's computer. The packets
are shipped separately over the network and could end up taking
wildly different routes to get from Fullmer's desk to their
destination.</TE>
<TE>   Fluor's ISP examines each packet and checks whether the
destination address also is on the UUNet network. If not, "it would
dump it on a peer like Genuity," said Kevin Bell, Fluor's director of
information technology. "They would carry it for a while, and then
they'd say, 'That's not ours, let's dump it on AT&amp;T.' Then AT&amp;T would
say, 'That's not ours, let's dump it on Verizon.' Eventually it gets
to the right network."</TE>
<TE>   The companies that operate Internet backbone networks don't charge
each other to carry traffic as phone companies do. But they charge
ISPs and smaller networks transit fees for the right to connect to
their networks. Those charges typically are a mix of a flat monthly
fee and an amount based on the volume of traffic sent over the
network, Greenstein said.</TE>
<TE>   That pricing model could become more common for traditional phone
calls too, as more carriers look for ways to shift calls from copper
wires to cheaper data lines using a technology called voice-over IP
(Internet Protocol). For Fullmer's call to Boston, the long-distance
company would digitize the sound of his voice and chop the data into
packets. Those packets would then be sent cross-country over multiple
networks in the same manner as his e-mail and reassembled in Boston
before the call was returned to Verizon's copper wires.</TE>
<TE>   With voice-over IP, phone companies might even abandon per-minute
pricing and charge customers flat monthly rates for all of their
calls, just like ISPs.</TE>
<TE>   If that occurs, phone company networks could become even more
intertwined.</TE>

<LD>In the face of a long and severe downturn in technology industries,
the world's largest electronics companies are not relenting in their
investments to build more efficient factories and develop computer
chips with greater capabilities.</LD>
<LD>   Intel Corp., IBM Corp., Texas Instruments Inc. and other companies
here and abroad, however, are not laying out billions of dollars
because they see a sudden upturn in the economy. Rather, they are
investing with confidence that the information technology
industries--computers, telecommunications and consumer
electronics--will enter a new expansion cycle and pull up the U.S.
economy by next year.</LD>
<LD>   The information tech industries certainly can move the whole
economy. They account for about $1.2 trillion in annual revenue, or
13% of the U.S. output of goods and services. But fears as well as
hopes drive the investments.</LD>
<TE>   The U.S. electronics companies and other giants of the global
electronics industry--which include Samsung Corp. of South Korea,
Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. of Taiwan and
STMicroelectronics of Switzerland--are investing billions of dollars
to push the technological envelope because they know that failing to
invest in bad times is the route to oblivion in a competitive world.</TE>
<TE>   It's an expensive game. New fabrication plants for integrated
circuits cost $3 billion. Intel's capital investment this year will
approach $5 billion, and that's a cutback from $7.5 billion last year
and $6.7 billion the year before. IBM is on a multiyear program of
investing $12 billion to expand and upgrade its massive semiconductor
plant in East Fishkill, N.Y. And Texas Instruments, a leading maker
of chips for cellular telephones, has invested more than $4 billion
in a new plant at its Dallas headquarters.</TE>
<TE>   The breakthroughs they are trying for include the ability to
manufacture electronic chips from larger silicon wafers, a process
that effectively would cut their production costs by one-third to
one-half, says Carl Howe, an analyst for Forrester Research in
Cambridge, Mass.</TE>
<TE>   The leading companies--Intel, Taiwan Semiconductor and IBM--also
are pushing to put 100 million transistors on a single chip, a feat
that requires imprinting circuits separated by spaces 1,000 times
narrower than a human hair.</TE>
<TE>   Companies aim for those breakthroughs so familiar products and
industrial processes can have greater functions and ease of
use--longer battery life for laptop computers and cellular
telephones, for example, or more precise controls for power plants,
car engines and space capsules.</TE>
<TE>   Risks are high because the technology slump is more severe than
any in the past.</TE>
<TE>   "Sales of computer systems and telephones are down for the third
year running. We've never seen that before," says Brian Matas, vice
president of IC Insights, a research firm based in Scottsdale, Ariz.</TE>
<TE>   This raises the fear that even when the economy recovers, sales of
computers, cell phones and other electronic systems won't rebound as
they have in the past.</TE>
<TE>   The stock market is not thrilled with the electronics firms'
willingness to invest for the future. Intel's stock, which closed
Friday at $18.75 on Nasdaq, is down 49% from its 52-week high and 75%
from its all-time high of $75 reached in 2000. Texas Instruments, at
$21.99 on Friday on the New York Stock Exchange, is off 41% from the
high for the last 12 months and 78% from its record price of 2000.</TE>
<TE>   But this is an industry taught by history to push on with
investments in bad times, despite the stock market's short-term
judgments. In the 1980s, markets for computer memory chips, one of
the first big products of the electronics revolution, were swamped
with tough competition.</TE>
<TE>   The dynamics were similar to the present. As use of personal
computers grew, customers demanded that makers increase the
capabilities of their circuits, from 4,000 transistors on a single
chip to 16,000 and then to 64,000. Pressing forward demanded
increasing investments even as competition drove down the prices and
profitability of existing chips. Japanese companies, such as NEC
Corp, Fujitsu Ltd. and divisions of Mitsubishi Corp., collectively
lost more than $4 billion battling for supremacy in memory chips,
which had been developed by Intel in the 1970s.</TE>
<TE>   In the 1980s, Intel needed a $350-million investment from IBM just
to stay in the race. Companies failed or fell back from world
leadership to second-rank status. So great was the concern for the
U.S. industry that the federal government and a consortium of private
companies invested $500 million apiece to set up Sematech Inc. in
Austin, Texas, to undertake expensive research for cash-strapped
companies.</TE>
<TE>   The efforts succeeded. Intel and other firms made investments to
develop powerful processor chips for personal computers, shifting the
technological and competitive focus of the world industry.
Technological and economic advances marched together through the
1990s as laptop and hand-held computers came along and the Internet
and wireless telephone communications opened up.</TE>
<TE>   Now there is a pause after the boom of the 1990s. What will
provide the next advance? Undoubtedly wireless communications,
experts say. Young people in Asia and elsewhere are using cell phones
and other computing-communi-cation devices in new ways.</TE>
<TE>   Wireless communications lags behind in the U.S., but that could
present an opportunity.</TE>
<TE>   "The U.S. is behind in wireless because the phone companies
control it and they don't innovate," says Roger McNamee, a partner at
Integral Capital Partners, a Menlo Park, Calif., investment firm.
He's referring to Verizon Inc., SBC Communications Inc., BellSouth
Corp. and other local monopoly descendants of the old Bell system.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. cell phones can't easily access the Internet, for example, or
plug into computers for enhanced capabilities. Nor can they
communicate globally as cell phone systems on other continents can,
although AT&amp;T is about to introduce a global wireless service in the
U.S. The advanced communications circuits being developed by Texas
Instruments and others will find ready markets in the drive to
overcome deficiencies in U.S. wireless systems.</TE>
<TE>   It should not be overlooked that the investments being made to
push the technological envelope result in fresh discoveries. As Intel
and other firms have squeezed complex circuitry into spaces the size
of a few atoms, "we have found that silicon at those levels emits
light," says Alex Wong, a Palo Alto-based partner in Apax Partners
Inc., a worldwide venture investment firm.</TE>
<TE>   What can result from sand-- which essentially is what silicon
is--emitting light? Who knows, but pursuing the possibilities is the
reason technology will revive and drive the economy of tomorrow, just
as that kind of technological development has transformed the world
economy for more than half a century.</TE>

<HD>Global Sale Not a Sure Link to Survival</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>ELIZABETH DOUGLASS and JUBE SHIVER Jr.</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Global Crossing Ltd.'s deal to be acquired by two Asian conglomerates
is a critical first step to salvaging the telecommunications firm,
but the company's survival is far from a sure thing.</LD>
<LD>   The fiber-optic network operator is losing money, the telecom
market still suffers from brutal competition and overcapacity, and
the deal with Hutchison Whampoa Ltd. and Singapore Technologies
Telemedia doesn't add one penny to Global Crossing's coffers.</LD>
<LD>   Instead, the $250 million pledged by the investors--plus an extra
$50 million of Global Crossing's own cash--would go directly to the
company's bank creditors, a group of institutions that has called the
shots since Jan. 28, when the telecommunications firm filed for
Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection.</LD>
<TE>   The buyout plan represents a surprisingly stingy payback for
Global Crossing's banks and other creditors, which are owed more than
$12 billion. But the deal gets worse if Global Crossing falters after
exiting bankruptcy, especially for non-bank creditors that got new
debt and equity in the restructured firm instead of cash.</TE>
<TE>   John Legere, chief executive of Global Crossing, said his company
has slimmed down enough for its operations to move into the black on
an operating basis (before income taxes, depreciation and
amortization) by the end of the year and to post net profit toward
the end of 2003.</TE>
<TE>   "We've got a good, strong business," Legere said. "The reason
we're even in this position today is because of what we've been able
to do over the last 10 months in restructuring the company, keeping
customers intact, stopping the cash burn and lowering dramatically
the cost structure of the business."</TE>
<TE>   Patrick Comack, a telecommunications analyst at Guzman &amp; Co.,
isn't convinced. For starters, he said, Global Crossing is tainted by
ongoing investigations into the company's accounting by the
Securities and Exchange Commission, the FBI and others.</TE>
<TE>   "Global Crossing's brand has been damaged beyond repair ... and
demand for wholesale [network capacity] has fallen off a cliff," said
Comack, whose firm does not own shares or do banking business with
the telecom company.</TE>
<TE>   Bermuda-based Global Crossing owns a fiber-optic communications
network that connects 27 countries and more than 200 cities, and its
business plan was based on selling capacity on the network to other
carriers through multiyear wholesale contracts.</TE>
<TE>   Barring a surprise resurgence in wholesale demand, Global Crossing
would have to rely on its ability to sell connections and data
services directly to large corporations. That could be difficult in
the wake of the bankruptcy filing last month by telecom giant
WorldCom Inc., which has left corporations more skittish about
entrusting critical communications to a carrier on the fringe of
solvency.</TE>
<TE>   "Even if your costs are lower [after bankruptcy], if you don't
have more customers coming onto your network, eventually you end up
back in bankruptcy," said Ken Twist, director of the global telecom
strategies group at RHK Inc., a telecommunications consulting firm in
South San Francisco. "There's not enough demand to keep all these
companies afloat."</TE>
<TE>   Twist and others said Global Crossing's post-bankruptcy staying
power will depend on its cash balance. The company's most recent
financial report showed it had $857 million in its bank accounts at
the end of June.</TE>
<TE>   A Cash Challenge</TE>
<TE>   Global Crossing's sales fell nearly 5% in June and the company
posted an operating loss of $118 million. But because the loss
included large noncash items, the firm managed to boost its cash
balance by $17 million.</TE>
<TE>   That performance will be hard to maintain if losses continue in
the $100-million range and revenue keeps falling. In addition,
company funds could be reduced by big nonoperating expenses such as
pending settlements and professional fees related to Global
Crossing's bankruptcy case, lawsuits and the accounting
investigations. In June, those fees ballooned to $20 million.</TE>
<TE>   The pending deal with Hutchison and ST Telemedia would give the
two firms a combined 61.5% stake in the new Global Crossing, but the
agreement states that the companies have no obligation to provide the
venture with additional funding.</TE>
<TE>   Canning Fok, managing director of Hutchison, told reporters in
Hong Kong last week that Global Crossing won't need more outside
money. "They have enough cash flow generated within the company," Fok
said.</TE>
<TE>   Under the agreement, Global Crossing would retain its 58.5%
ownership of Asia Global Crossing, a separately traded affiliate that
operates a fiber-optic network connecting key countries in the
Pacific Rim. Asia Global's operations, though unprofitable and
relatively small, are considered more valuable than the other
portions of Global Crossing because the Asian lines face less
competition and serve a market in which demand has merely flattened
instead of plummeted.</TE>
<TE>   The Asian subsidiary, which is not in bankruptcy, is entertaining
buyout and investment options to shore up its balance sheet after
Global Crossing reneged on an agreement to lend the unit $400
million. It is unclear what role Global Crossing's new owners would
play in determining the fate of Asia Global.</TE>
<TE>   Until earlier this year, Hutchison and ST Telemedia were partners
with Asia Global Crossing in several ventures. Hutchison also owns
less than 2% of Asia Global, a spokesman said.</TE>
<TE>   But absent a strong financial commitment from Hutchison and ST
Telemedia--either through Global Crossing or as a separate
investment--the Asian unit could be forced into filing for bankruptcy
protection. That scenario, which is not prohibited under the publicly
available sections of the Hutchison-ST Telemedia agreement, could
wipe out Global Crossing's equity stake in Asia Global, leaving only
a commercial network-sharing agreement between the two firms.</TE>
<TE>   For now, Legere is focused on Global Crossing. He believes that
the strong ties to Hutchison and ST Telemedia--both conglomerates
with substantial telecommunications holdings--will provide the
company with stability and a pipeline to valuable new corporate
customers. Legere and Fok have said Hutchison probably will use
Global Crossing's network to carry data-rich wireless services from
Hutchison mobile phone units.</TE>
<TE>   But Global Crossing's new owners also may trigger scrutiny from
Washington lawmakers and regulators leery of letting U.S.
communications networks be controlled by foreign companies or by
governments that don't allow U.S. firms into their domestic markets.</TE>
<TE>   Some politicians worry that Hutchison, which is controlled by Li
Ka-shing, a Hong Kong billionaire with close ties to the Chinese
government, might monitor the communications traffic flowing through
Global Crossing's network at the behest of Beijing officials.</TE>
<TE>   Global Crossing's customers have included the State and Defense
departments, although Pentagon officials canceled a $450-million
contract with the company this year because the agency's rules
prohibit doing business with a company in bankruptcy.</TE>
<TE>   No evidence has surfaced to suggest that the Chinese government
would be a direct investor in Global Crossing, but Federal
Communications Commission officials privately have indicated they
probably will review the deal to determine whether it is in the
public interest.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Rep. Dana Rohrabacher (R-Huntington Beach) has said he
will ask the House Committee on Government Reform to hold a hearing
on the issue as soon as next month.</TE>
<TE>   Raising Questions</TE>
<TE>   Li "is part of an inner circle of investors that has direct ties
to Chinese officials in Beijing," said Aaron Lewis, Rohrabacher's
spokesman.</TE>
<TE>   "Our suspicion is that [Li] is a conduit for the Chinese
government to exercise control over the company. And we think it's a
good idea for the [U.S.] government to take a look at that," Lewis
said.</TE>
<TE>   That move could attract support from powerful lawmakers such as
Rep. W.J. "Billy" Tauzin (R-La.), chairman of the House Energy and
Commerce Committee. Tauzin has said that "foreign government
ownership raises concerns about national security" and fair
competition in the marketplace.</TE>
<TE>   "His position is that he isn't concerned so much about foreign
company ownership, but he draws the line at foreign government
investment or control," said Commerce Committee spokesman Ken
Johnson.</TE>
<TE>   ST Telemedia spokeswoman Laura Kline said the two companies are
"confident in the transaction" and have pledged that they will "work
with the appropriate governmental and regulatory bodies to address
any concerns they may have."</TE>
<TE>   With the U.S. telecommunications industry in collapse, Kline said,
"I think Congress is more concerned that its major telecommunications
companies stay solvent and that their employees have jobs."</TE>
<TE>   Federal law prohibits the transfer of communications licenses held
by a U.S. firm to any company that is 20% or more directly owned by a
foreign company or foreign government. There is a similar limitation
on indirect ownership. The FCC, however, may grant a waiver of the
latter provision if the agency determines a deal is in the public
interest.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, under the Cable Landing License Act, the FCC and
State Department have the authority to grant, withhold or put
conditions on communications licenses to operate undersea cable
"directly or indirectly connecting the United States with any foreign
country."</TE>
<TE>   An FCC spokeswoman declined to comment, and no State Department
official could be reached for comment on how the federal law would
apply to Global Crossing's licenses.</TE>
<TE>   A spokeswoman for the General Services Administration, which
administers a multibillion-dollar contract under which major U.S.
carriers provide telecommunications services to federal agencies,
said Global Crossing is not excluded from doing business with the
federal government. The company still is listed as a vendor providing
telecommunications services to the Defense and State departments.</TE>
<TE>   Some agencies, including the FBI and Defense Department, also may
have a hand in determining the outcome of Hutchison's proposed deal
with Global Crossing, experts say.</TE>
<TE>   Although Global Crossing officials have expressed confidence that
the proposed deal will pass government scrutiny, the thicket of
government regulation and oversight could delay the transaction,
derail it outright or add significant financial or regulatory
conditions.</TE>
<TE>   There's one other potential irritant: The Hutchison-ST Telemedia
deal specifies that the restructured Global Crossing be organized
"under the laws of Bermuda or the Cayman Islands."</TE>
<TE>   In recent months, U.S. lawmakers have railed against companies
that skirt U.S. taxation and more stringent laws by keeping their
headquarters in tax-friendly locales such as Bermuda.</TE>

<CX>   Global Crossing contract--An Aug. 18 Business section story about
Global Crossing Ltd. incorrectly stated that the company lost a
lucrative contract with the Department of Defense because it had
filed for bankruptcy protection. The department had decided to re-bid
the contract in August 2001, and Global Crossing did not file for
bankruptcy protection until Jan. 28.</CX>

<LD>When my monthly cable bill reached $60 without even providing premium

eliminated the irritatingly complex set-top box and provided decent
reception on the networks, which is pretty much what I watch when I
watch TV at all.</LD>
<LD>   Now, the Federal Communications Commission has mandated that by
2007 I must either shell out $2,000 for a digital TV set or buy a set
equipped with a complicated and expensive piece of technology on
board that will pick up digital signals ["FCC Says New TVs Must Be

<LD>   I've seen digital TV in the stores. The difference in quality is

<DL></DL>
<LD>The current economic mess is caused in great measure by the boards of
directors of corporations. These boards are composed mostly of
corporate officers of other companies, who often select their own
boards from among the officers of the corporations on whose boards
they sit.</LD>
<LD>   This mutual support arrangement results in incredibly high
salaries and retirement packages, stock options and other benefits.
All the top executives have to do is plan short term to push the
value of the stock as high as possible and then cash in their stock
options, usually multimillion-dollar gains, and forget about the
shareholders, employees and the companies themselves.</LD>
<LD>   This behavior must stop in order to restore the confidence of
investors and ensure stability in employee retirement funds. A good
starting point would be a ban on stock options, perhaps replaced by
profit sharing, and ensuring that the members of the boards of
directors are independent and are not allowed to have on their own
boards executives of the companies on whose boards they sit.</LD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>I just received a notice that Adelphia Communications Corp. is
raising my cable rates because it faces "increases in operational
expenses such as wages, specialized training for our employees,
utilities, fuel, insurance, equipment to 24-hour service and support
and rising fees from providers of many of the popular programming
services our customers enjoy and expect" ["Adelphia Subscribers
Notified of Rate Hike," Aug. 9].</LD>
<LD>   Think maybe the couple of billions of dollars that former Adelphia
Chief Executive John Rigas pocketed in phony off-balance-sheet loans
might belong somewhere on this laundry list?</LD>
<LD>   If this isn't preposterous enough, the notice touchingly concludes
that Adelphia is raising rates in order to remain competitive and "to
continue to meet our customers' expectations."</LD>

<LD>What amazing arrogance that Enron Corp. insiders such as former CEO
Jeffrey K. Skilling's wife, Rebecca Carter, and former Vice Chairman
Mark Frevert would even consider seeking more after they were among
the folks who walked away with a combined $25 million ["Ex-Enron
Execs Seek Extra Severance," Aug. 13].</LD>
<LD>   Frevert claims it's due him as part of a performance bonus.
Federal prosecutors should be asked how soon Enron officials will be
indicted for their conduct.</LD>

<HD>Bypass Trusts Make Full Use of the Estate Tax Exemption</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LIZ PULLIAM WESTON</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Question: You recently responded to a question from a reader who was
confused about whether married couples were limited to a $1-million
estate tax exemption this year. Your answer, that each person gets a
$1-million exemption, was technically correct, but you missed an
opportunity to educate people about the possibility of wasting their
exemption and the importance of bypass trusts.</LD>
<LD>   Answer: Indeed, there is a danger that estate tax exemptions can
be wasted. Here's how it might play out:</LD>
<LD>   Say a husband dies this year and leaves his estate to his wife.
He's allowed to do that without incurring any estate taxes, because
spouses are entitled to what's called an unlimited marital deduction.</LD>
<TE>   That money becomes part of his wife's estate, however. So if she
hasn't spent it all by the time she dies, her estate could owe taxes
on some or all of the bequest.</TE>
<TE>   Let's say, instead, that the husband puts $1 million--the
estate-tax limit--into a bypass trust. His wife can use the income
from the trust and can even tap the principal in certain
circumstances. But when she dies, the trust money goes to the
secondary beneficiaries--usually the children--without incurring
estate taxes. The money is never part of her estate, so it doesn't
count against her $1-million exemption.</TE>
<TE>   The husband also could avoid wasting his exemption by bequeathing
the money directly to his kids, rather than putting it in trust for
his wife. If she's well off without the money, that's sometimes the
better course. That way, the kids don't have to wait for her to die
to get their inheritance.</TE>
<TE>   For many couples, however, the bypass trust is a well-tested
method to make sure the surviving spouse is provided for while taking
full advantage of the estate tax exemption.</TE>
<TE>   Use Can Result in</TE>
<TE>   Tax on Savings Bonds</TE>
<TE>   Q: We recently cashed in savings bonds totaling more than $8,000
that we had purchased to help my son pay for college. We put the
proceeds in a money market account so he could cover personal
expenses and his car payment. My son applied for a school loan and is
using that money to pay his tuition and rent. Is the interest on
these savings bonds subject to taxation?</TE>
<TE>   A: The way you've got things set up, it is.</TE>
<TE>   You can avoid taxation on Series EE savings bonds purchased after
Dec. 31, 1989, but only if you use the money to pay tuition and fees.
It can't be used to pay for rent, board, books or any other expenses.
The cost of tuition and fees must be more than the value of the
redeemed bonds to get the full exclusion. Otherwise, the benefit is
reduced proportionately. (If your son's tuition and fees are just
$4,000 this year, for example, you would escape tax on only half of
the interest the bonds earned.)</TE>
<TE>   There are other restrictions as well. For example, you or another
parent must be the bond owner, and you should be the one paying the
tuition and fees. If the bonds were in your son's name, they're not
eligible for tax-free treatment. The bonds also must be redeemed in
the same year the bond owner pays the expenses.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, there are income limitations. You can exclude all the
interest from taxation only if your modified adjusted gross income
was $86,400 or less if you filed jointly. (The limit is $57,600 for
single filers.)</TE>
<TE>   You can learn more about tax-free treatment of savings bonds when
used for educational expenses on the Bureau of the Public Debt's Web
site, www.savingsbonds.gov.</TE>
<TE>   Most Have to Pay</TE>
<TE>   to See Credit Reports</TE>
<TE>   Q: You often emphasize the importance of checking your credit
report once a year. How can you do this without paying fees?</TE>
<TE>   A: Generally, you can't, unless you recently have been turned down
for credit or live in one of six states that require that you be
given one free copy a year. Those states are Colorado, Georgia,
Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey and Vermont.</TE>
<TE>   Otherwise, you're usually stuck paying the $8 to $9 fee. You can
cut down on the cost by checking your report at just one of the three
major bureaus, rather than buying from all three. The bureaus share
information, so most of what's shown on one report will be reflected
on the other two.</TE>

<HD>Victims Find Unscrupulous Movers Take Them for a Ride</HD>
<DH>Regulation: Complaints include jacked-up fees and lost
items. Lack of government oversight frustrates consumers.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MYRON LEVIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>California Van Lines is the long-distance mover to the stars. On the
firm's snazzy Web site, testimonials from celebrities such as Ed
McMahon and actor Randy Quaid extol its incomparable service.</LD>
<LD>   The problem is, spokesmen for the stars say the endorsements are
fakes.</LD>
<LD>   But more than 90 real-life testimonials have turned up in the
files of the Better Business Bureau and other agencies over the last
three years. These are complaints from customers who said the Los
Angeles-based firm either overcharged them, delivered their goods
days or weeks late, or lost or damaged prized possessions--then did
not pay their claims.</LD>
<TE>   There are many reputable interstate movers, but also plenty that
abuse consumers in the most brazen ways, yet carry on with minimal
interference. That's because regulatory oversight is almost
nonexistent, and victims of unscrupulous movers have no recourse. The
problem has been highlighted in recent years in hearings before
Congress, but experts say almost nothing has been done.</TE>
<TE>   Waseem Choudhry's moving experience began in late May. Lured by
the promise of a "half-price special," he hired California Van Lines
to move him from Anaheim to Maryland. But once his goods were on the
truck, Choudhry said, he was told to approve extra charges on his
credit card or "you will not get your things."</TE>
<TE>   Choudhry said his belongings arrived three weeks late. While
waiting, he and his wife--then six months pregnant--slept on the
floor. He said the movers would not unload the items until he paid
double the estimate, then he discovered they had lost his bed and
left him someone else's mattress. Choudhry said that when he tried to
file a claim for missing items, the firm would not return his calls.</TE>
<TE>   It turns out that more than a month before Choudhry hired the
mover, federal authorities had revoked its operating authority
because its insurance had been canceled. Nonetheless, the firm has
not shut down.</TE>
<TE>   Representatives of California Van Lines said they are operating
legally, and one said that although he did not know the specifics of
Choudhry's case, the company would not have hiked his bill unless his
goods weighed more than the estimate.</TE>
<TE>   "We've done everything ... by the book," said Brian Ewell,
president and owner of California Van Lines. "We have done a lot of
business, ... and yes, over the years you will have a couple of
customers that you will drop the ball on. You try to do the best you
can to make it right."</TE>
<TE>   The long list of bitter clients has not led to regulatory action
against California Van Lines.</TE>
<TE>   In an industry plagued by rogue operators, a mover can attract
carloads of complaints without drawing scrutiny. Even the American
Moving and Storage Assn., a trade group, acknowledges that it's not
just a problem of a few bad apples.</TE>
<TE>   "There are a lot of what we call 'scam movers' out there that we
would dearly love to see driven out of the business," said David
Sparkman, spokesman for the group. "It really is a situation of
caveat emptor, of buyer beware."</TE>
<TE>   Critics put the blame on a regulatory Catch-22. Under U.S. law,
authority over interstate movers rests with the federal government,
tying the hands of the states.</TE>
<TE>   However, the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration, the
branch of the Transportation Department that is supposed to ride herd
on movers, acknowledges making very little effort. Agency officials
say they can't afford to divert staff from their main mission:
reducing casualties from truck and bus wrecks.</TE>
<TE>   A Regulation Vacuum</TE>
<TE>   The result is "a vacuum that has allowed unscrupulous carriers to
flourish and take advantage of consumers," the General Accounting
Office said last year in a highly critical report. Dishonest movers
"are aware that the department does little to enforce the consumer
protection regulations, or provide much oversight of the industry,"
the GAO said.</TE>
<TE>   Compounding the problem is the extraordinary leverage movers have
while in control of their customers' belongings.</TE>
<TE>   "Once your belongings are out of your possession--if you're not
dealing with somebody reputable--you're in jeopardy of losing
everything," said David Longo, spokesman for the motor carrier
agency.</TE>
<TE>   For many victims, their ordeal begins with a low-ball estimate
that the mover has no intention of honoring. The customer's
belongings may be held hostage until hundreds or thousands of extra
dollars are paid. It's illegal for movers to demand more than 10%
above the estimate to release a customer's goods, but many flout the
rule with impunity.</TE>
<TE>   Many recalcitrant movers also refuse to resolve or arbitrate
claims for lost or damaged goods, as federal rules require.</TE>
<TE>   Complicating the task of choosing a reputable mover, sometimes the
company hired for a job arranges for a second firm to do the pickup
and a third to transport the goods. Renegade operators also use
multiple names to hide their tracks, or shut down and reopen under a
new name.</TE>
<TE>   Although abusive practices occur nationwide, the New
York-to-Florida corridor has been the main hotbed of scamming firms.</TE>
<TE>   Rip-offs also occur in intrastate moves. But on the long-distance
side, authorities say, the clamor for less government has made things
worse.</TE>
<TE>   No More 'Nannies'</TE>
<TE>   Until it was dissolved by Congress in 1995, the Interstate
Commerce Commission was assigned to regulate movers and devoted as
many as 50 members of its staff to consumer complaints. Though taking
few enforcement actions, the agency often was able to jawbone movers
into resolving complaints.</TE>
<TE>   After the demise of the ICC, the job was reassigned to the Federal
Motor Carrier Safety Administration. But Congress directed that
federal officials no longer intercede for consumers.</TE>
<TE>   This was considered "a nanny function," recalled Linda Morgan, a
former ICC chairman and now head of the federal Surface
Transportation Board. The thinking was that "government shouldn't be
in the business of holding people's hands."</TE>
<TE>   Only three members on the motor carrier agency's 760-person staff
are working full time in household goods. Since Sept. 11, the agency
has new responsibilities for the security of hazardous shipments, so
the situation isn't likely to change.</TE>
<TE>   The agency maintains a hotline that annually logs as many as 4,000
household-goods complaints, but there is little follow-up.</TE>
<TE>   "There's more of them [scamming movers] than there are of us, and
they know that," Longo said.</TE>
<TE>   The agency and DOT's office of inspector general have taken action
in about two dozen of the most egregious cases--imposing civil
penalties or injunctions and sending several corrupt movers to jail.</TE>
<TE>   Yet wronged consumers usually have no recourse. Though Congress
declared that they could pursue their grievances through arbitration
or lawsuits, neither has proved a viable option.</TE>
<TE>   Federal regulations require movers to accept binding arbitration
for claims of as much as $5,000, but many companies ignore the rule.
And because interstate carriers enjoy broad legal immunity, the cost
of suing them can exceed the damages that might be won.</TE>
<TE>   A nearly century-old law known as the Carmack Amendment holds that
carriers can be held responsible only for the value of lost or
damaged goods. Claims for negligence or misrepresentation, which
might bring a sizable damage award, are barred.</TE>
<TE>   "When Congress was looking at all this, I don't think they really
understood" that consumers might have "no place to go if they are
getting ripped off," Morgan said.</TE>
<TE>   Critics have called on Congress to unshackle the states by giving
them permission to pursue interstate movers under state consumer
protection laws. At the very least, they say, states should have the
option of enforcing the federal regulations, because the motor
carrier agency does not.</TE>
<TE>   The American Moving and Storage Assn., though acknowledging the
problem, has weighed in against these proposals. They "would result
in an inconsistent interpretation all over the country of what the
federal regulations are," said Sparkman, the group's spokesman.</TE>
<TE>   Left for now to fend for themselves, irate consumers share horror
stories online at Web sites such as www.ripoffreport.com and
www.movingadvocateteam.com.</TE>
<TE>   The latter site, created by Florida resident James Balderamma
after a bad experience, includes a blacklist nominated by furious
customers.</TE>
<TE>   "We flat out tell people, 'Do not ... use these movers,' "
Balderamma said. "There is literally nothing you can do to stop them
from ripping you off.... They know there's zero enforcement."</TE>
<TE>   By contrast, the Web site of California Van Lines boasts moving
excellence.</TE>
<TE>   According to quotations that have appeared on the site, McMahon
and Quaid were blown away by the service they received. So were "Gina
Davis, Actress"--the film star's first name is Geena--and "Cheryl
Crow, Recording Artist," who spells her name "Sheryl."</TE>
<TE>   McMahon, Quaid and Davis said through spokesmen that the
endorsements were phony. Crow's publicist failed to return phone
calls.</TE>
<TE>   Ewell said California Van Lines did move the celebrities and
received their endorsements, but he was unable to provide
documentation.</TE>
<TE>   After inquiries by The Times, a lawyer for Quaid demanded that his
name be removed, and California Van Lines complied. His alleged
quotation still appears, but instead of "Randy Quaid, Actor," the
exact words are attributed to "Milano Mellon, MD."</TE>
<TE>   Authority Revoked</TE>
<TE>   The site also says California Van Lines is "fully licensed and
insured." But on April 16, the Federal Motor Carrier Safety
Administration revoked the firm's authority to operate as an
interstate mover, because its insurance carrier had canceled its
coverage. Longo, the federal agency's spokesman, said it's illegal
for carriers whose authority has been revoked to haul household
goods, but he acknowledged that the agency did not follow up to check
on the company's status.</TE>
<TE>   California Van Lines has continued to sign up customers. Company
representatives said this is legal, because since April they have
acted as booking agents for movers that actually haul the loads.</TE>
<TE>   However, some customers--including Choudhry and Zhanna
Osminina--who hired California Van Lines after April 16 told The
Times that the firm had hauled their goods.</TE>
<TE>   In May, Osminina hired Nationwide Relocation Services, a broker,
to coordinate her move from Maryland to Los Angeles. Nationwide sent
All Points Moving &amp; Storage to pick up her things. After Osminina's
goods were in transit, she learned they had been transferred to
California Van Lines.</TE>
<TE>   Osminina arrived at her apartment in Los Feliz and waited, without
a bed to sleep in, or the clothes she needed to apply for a job.</TE>
<TE>   Osminina said the truck showed up 10 days after the deadline
promised in her contract. She said the movers would not unload until
she paid nearly $800 more than her estimate. She said a computer desk
and other things had been broken and six boxes of clothing and other
items had been lost.</TE>
<TE>   But Osminina and other former customers interviewed by The Times
said that what distressed them most was the disregard they said they
were shown when they inquired about their overdue shipments. They
recalled representatives of the mover telling different stories every
day and being put on hold for as long as 20 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   The company's general manager, who identified himself as Gary
Johnson, said customers are put on hold--but only because "we're very
popular."</TE>
<TE>   Ewell said the firm gets many referrals from old customers, so it
must be doing something right. "You're writing about the wrong
company," he said, "because we do everything ... by the book."</TE>

<LD>If you are planning to move to a new state, you should take care to
hire a reputable mover. Experience has shown you will get little help
from federal watchdogs or the courts if things go terribly wrong.</LD>
<LD>   A few tips:</LD>
<LD>   * Get several estimates in writing. Never settle for an estimate
over the phone. Consider choosing a binding rather than nonbinding
estimate. The binding estimate may cost a bit more but theoretically
keeps the mover from jacking up the price. The cost is primarily
determined by the distance of the move and the weight of the
shipment, but customers also should get a full explanation of charges
for packing and unpacking materials.</LD>
<TE>   * Beware of companies that offer to move you for a song--they may
have no intention of honoring their low-ball estimate. In some cases,
these firms aren't really movers, but rather unlicensed,
Internet-based relocation agents or brokers. They will farm out the
move to other companies that you will have no chance to investigate.</TE>
<TE>   * Beware of firms with names nearly identical to those of
established movers. This is a common deception by fly-by-night firms.</TE>
<TE>   * Consider hiring a firm from the American Moving and Storage
Assn.'s list of 140 certified movers. These companies, which are a
subset of the association's 3,800 members, have agreed to adhere to a
set of voluntary standards. To get the names of certified movers, or
for information about an AMSA service for obtaining estimates,
contact the organization at amconf@amconf.org, by phone at (703)
683-7410, or by fax at (703) 683-7527.</TE>
<TE>   * Consider buying extra insurance. Standard coverage is free but
minimal, paying only 60 cents a pound for items damaged, lost or
stolen. If a 20-pound precious family heirloom is destroyed, standard
coverage pays you just $12.</TE>
<TE>   * Create an inventory and carefully review the mover's inventory
of your goods. Consider photographing or videotaping your belongings
to verify their condition at time of pickup. Also at pickup,
carefully read the bill of lading, which is your contract with the
mover.</TE>
<TE>   * Your mover is required by law to give you a booklet spelling out
your rights and responsibilities as a shipper of household goods.
Included is your right to binding arbitration for damage or loss
claims up to $5,000. Make sure you receive and review the booklet.</TE>

<LD>A continued slide in long-term interest rates has consumers wondering
whether they should refinance their mortgage--often for the second or
third time in just a matter of years.</LD>
<LD>   But the proliferation of mortgage products in recent years can
leave borrowers mystified about which type of loan best suits their
needs. Should they get a loan with a fixed interest rate or one with
a variable rate? Or should they try one of the new "hybrid" loans,
which charge a fixed rate for three to seven years before switching
to a variable rate?</LD>
<LD>   And what about duration? Should they go for a traditional 30-year
mortgage or try a 15-year loan, with its higher monthly payments but
impressive long-term savings?</LD>
<TE>   The answers depend on a variety of factors: the borrower's
financial situation, how long he or she plans to live in the house
and the outlook for interest rates.</TE>
<TE>   Take, for example, a home buyer who believes that interest rates
are bottoming out--as they might be. After hitting generational lows
last week, the yield on the 10-year Treasury note, a benchmark for
mortgage rates, rebounded smartly late in the week. This borrower may
feel more comfortable with a fixed-rate loan that locks in today's
low rates.</TE>
<TE>   On the other hand, someone who plans to move within 10 years may
benefit from a hybrid loan, which may offer initial rates well below
the going rate on a 30-year loan.</TE>
<TE>   "If you know you're not going to be in your house for more than
five or 10 years, there's no reason to pay more for a 30-year loan,"
says Steven Foster, president of Vista Financial Advisors in North
Hollywood. "The shorter-term loans can save you a lot of money. I'm
all for them."</TE>
<TE>   Hybrid Savings</TE>
<TE>   The monthly payment on a $200,000, 30-year loan would amount to
roughly $1,256, based on a rate of 6.44%. But a hybrid loan with a
rate that is fixed for five years and then is adjusted once a year
after that can be had for a 5.27% initial rate, says HSH Associates,
a Butler, N.J., rate-tracking firm. That would make the monthly
payment just $1,107 for the first 60 months--a differential that
would save the consumer nearly $9,000 over the first five years of
the loan.</TE>
<TE>   Even if the loan rate rocketed 3 percentage points with its first
adjustment and remained in the mid-8% range after that, it would take
several years for the borrower's $9,000 in savings to be eaten up by
the higher monthly payments, says Keith Gumbinger, vice president
with HSH.</TE>
<TE>   "A compelling argument can be made for the five-year product," he
adds. "In reality, even assuming that rates rose sharply, you could
go eight to 10 years and do no worse in total costs than you would
have done with a 30-year loan."</TE>
<TE>   The trick is that consumers must be disciplined enough to save
that $9,000 rather than spend it, Gumbinger said. If you spent it,
the rate hike could blow your budget and leave you feeling poor the
moment the fixed-rate period ended.</TE>
<TE>   Anyone considering an adjustable-rate loan should pay attention to
the terms of the deal, Gumbinger notes. Most variable-rate loans
place caps on annual interest rate adjustments. Usually, those caps
promise that the interest rate on the loan will not jump more than 2
percentage points in any one year, nor more than 6 percentage points
over the life of the loan.</TE>
<TE>   Given today's starting rates, that means the worst-case scenario
for a person getting a simple one-year adjustable loan would be that
the rate could rise from today's 4.58% to 10.58% in 2005. That would
boost the initial $511.45 monthly payment on a $100,000 loan to $921
a month.</TE>
<TE>   Some hybrid loans that stay fixed for several years before the
first adjustment allow an even bigger rate hike--perhaps 3 to 4
percentage points--in the first adjustment period. But because
homeowners tend to either sell or refinance in less than 10 years,
the savings borrowers enjoy in the early years of a five-year or
seven-year fixed loan could prove permanent, Foster says.</TE>
<TE>   Common hybrid loans can stay fixed for three to 10 years. However,
the longer the fixed-interest period, the closer the rate gets to
that of a 30-year fixed-rate loan. The national average rate on a
loan that's fixed for 10 years before becoming adjustable is
6.26%--just 0.18 of a percentage point less than the going rate on a
30-year fixed-rate loan, Gumbinger notes.</TE>
<TE>   On the other hand, those who plan to stay in a home for a long
time should take into account that interest rates are near historic
lows. If you're averse to risk and are at a point in life where you
don't plan to move, remodel, or refinance to pay for someone's
college education, sticking with a fixed-rate loan that locks in
today's low rates can be the wiser course, says Floyd Walters,
president of BWA Mortgage in La Canada Flintridge.</TE>
<TE>   What about duration? A 15-year fixed-rate loan is generally
cheaper--currently offering about a 0.6% break on the interest
rate--than a 30-year loan, Gumbinger says. But because borrowers must
pay off the balance in 180 payments rather than 360, the monthly
payments are steep. The monthly payment on a $100,000, 15-year loan,
based on the national average interest rate, would run $836 versus
$628 for a comparable 30-year loan.</TE>
<TE>   Those who know they can afford the payments, both now and later,
can greatly benefit by using them, Walters says. By getting a loan
with a shorter term, a borrower can save tens of thousands of dollars
in interest charges.</TE>
<TE>   Evaluate Payments</TE>
<TE>   But those who aren't certain they can make the higher principal
payments should realize that they're putting their home at risk. If
you find you can't afford the higher monthly payments, you'll have to
refinance or default, which could cause you to lose your home.</TE>
<TE>   For those with uncertain prospects, a better option might be to
secure the 30-year loan and just pay it off faster by making larger
monthly payments.</TE>
<TE>   "I have some clients who get the 30-year loan and have me run out
a 15-year amortization schedule," Walters says. "Some of them are
small-business owners who just don't know what to expect in the
future."</TE>
<TE>   This strategy keeps the borrower's options open, he says. On the
down side, the slightly higher rate on a $100,000, 30-year loan costs
about $40 a month in additional interest.</TE>
<TE>   Still, paying off the principal faster--not the interest rate
differential--is what provides the bulk of the savings from a 15-year
loan.</TE>
<TE>   Specifically, someone who got a $100,000, 30-year loan at the
national average rate, but makes the $836.31 monthly payment that
would be required if they had gotten a 15-year loan at the slightly
lower 5.86%, 15-year rate, would retire their 30-year loan in less
than 16 years at a total cost of $160,378. The cost of paying the
30-year loan on schedule: $226,125, or $65,747 more.</TE>
<TE>   "The big savings is not from the differential in rate--it's from
paying the principal down faster," Walters notes. "You just have to
be disciplined enough to do it."</TE>

<TE>Mortgage Options</TE>
<TE>Borrowers can get lower interest rates with shorter-term loans or
so-called hybrid adjustables--a great option for those likely to move
or refinance again. But those who plan to stay in their homes may
prefer the stability of a 30-year fixed-rate loan. Here's what the
different options cost for a $100,000 loan compared with last year.</TE>

<LD>Nation's Airlines Hit</LD>
<LD>   More Turbulence</LD>
<LD>   The airline industry saw one of the most tumultuous weeks since
the terrorist attacks nearly a year ago.</LD>
<TE>   The week began with US Airways Group filing for bankruptcy
protection. The nation's seventh-largest airline intends to continue
its service--3,800 flights daily to 204 cities--as it works with
creditors and the U.S. Bankruptcy Court to mend its finances. The
airline said it hopes to emerge from its reorganization within six to
eight months.</TE>
<TE>   AMR Corp.'s American Airlines, the No. 1 carrier, unveiled a major
overhaul that would eliminate 7,000 jobs, or 6% of its work force;
reduce seating capacity by 9%; ground certain jetliners to simplify
its fleet; adjust the classes of service it offers on international
routes; and attempt to smooth the flow of planes at its hub airports
at Dallas/Fort Worth and Chicago.</TE>
<TE>   Then United Airlines announced that it would seek Bankruptcy Court
protection if its unions, creditors and other stakeholders don't
agree to make deeper concessions to stem parent company UAL Corp.'s
cash drain.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Stock Analyst Grubman Resigns Amid Probes</TE>
<TE>   Jack Grubman, once the most powerful telecommunications analyst on
Wall Street, resigned from Salomon Smith Barney amid government
investigations of whether financial conflicts tainted his stock
recommendations.</TE>
<TE>   In what the brokerage called a "mutual agreement," Grubman
resigned after accepting a $13.2-million severance package.</TE>
<TE>   As his unusually close relationship with Salomon's investment
banking department came to light in recent months, critics charged
that Grubman's stock recommendations were aimed primarily at pleasing
the managements of the subject companies, in the hope of bringing
Salomon more fee-generating underwriting business.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Stocks End Week  With Modest Gains</TE>
<TE>   Stocks overcame a series of lackluster economic reports last week
to post modest gains, helped in part by the relatively uneventful
passing of the deadline for big U.S. companies to certify their
financial results.</TE>
<TE>   The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index gained 2.2% for the week. That was
the benchmark index's fourth straight weekly gain, its longest
winning streak since May 2001.</TE>
<TE>   Tech stocks did even better, with the Nasdaq composite rising
4.2%. The blue chip Dow industrials inched up 0.4%.</TE>
<TE>   Stock initially slid after Tuesday's Federal Reserve meeting but
rebounded during the next two sessions.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Executives Certify Corporate Earnings</TE>
<TE>   Executives of most large U.S. companies vouched for their firms'
financial results, meeting a much-anticipated federal deadline.</TE>
<TE>   The declarations by top managers helped to stoke a stock market
rally, as a feared wave of earnings restatements by major companies
didn't materialize.</TE>
<TE>   Executives of a relative few companies said accounting problems
prevented them from certifying their results, but it appeared that
most of those firms already were known to be facing financial probes
by regulators.</TE>
<TE>   As hundreds of companies filed the required documents with the
Securities and Exchange Commission in Washington, the Dow Jones
industrial average jumped 260.92 points, or 3.1%, to 8,743.31.</TE>
<TE>   That raised hopes that investor confidence would be buoyed after a
series of major accounting scandals drove Wall Street to five-year
lows in July.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Fed Sees New Risks; Bush Touts Economy</TE>
<TE>   As the Bush administration wrestled with what to do about the
economy, Federal Reserve policymakers signaled that they would act to
keep the nation from sliding back into a recession, although it was
too soon to cut interest rates again.</TE>
<TE>   At his economic forum in Waco, Texas, President Bush tried to
restore investor and voter confidence and received a generally upbeat
assessment from participants.</TE>
<TE>   But the president didn't mention the American Airlines layoffs.
Democrats continued to criticize the forum as a public relations
ploy.</TE>
<TE>   In Washington, the Federal Reserve left its benchmark short-term
interest rate unchanged at 1.75%, a 40-year low. The Fed indicated
that it is now worrying about whether the economy, hit by slow growth
and increasing unemployment, will stall.</TE>
<TE>   Homeowners, on the other hand, got some good news with
expectations that mortgage rates, already at 30-year lows, could
continue to drop, analysts said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Vivendi Reports Loss, Plans Asset Sale</TE>
<TE>   French media conglomerate Vivendi Universal revealed a $12-billion
loss for the first half of the year and said it would sell its U.S.
publishing house Houghton Mifflin and other assets to help stem a
deepening cash crisis.</TE>
<TE>   Vivendi's new chief executive, Jean-Rene Fourtou, acknowledged
that the company "is facing a liquidity problem," but said he had
reached a tentative agreement for a $2.9-billion loan from French
banks. He also vowed to raise $9.8 billion from asset sales in the
next two years to reduce Vivendi's sizable debt.</TE>
<TE>   But his assurances did little to calm investors. Vivendi's shares
fell 26% on the Paris market to their lowest level since June 1994.
And credit-rating firm Standard &amp; Poor's lowered Vivendi's debt to
"junk" status.</TE>
<TE>   Moody's Investors Service also downgraded Vivendi and said that if
the company fails to get a bank loan in the next few weeks, "that
would lead to a severe short-term liquidity problem."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Boeing Lands  C-17 Contract</TE>
<TE>   Boeing Co. won a much-anticipated order to build 60 additional
C-17 transports under a $9.7-billion Pentagon contract that will
extend the life of California's last remaining military aircraft
manufacturing facility.</TE>
<TE>   In what analysts called a shot in the arm for Southern
California's aerospace industry, Boeing executives said the
contract--considered one of the largest in recent years--would help
it continue operating the C-17 production line in Long Beach until
2008 and keep 7,000 workers employed.</TE>
<TE>   Boeing has built 89 of the 120 aircraft ordered under the original
contract. It was facing the prospect of having to close its Long
Beach Airport plant in two years.</TE>
<TE>   Former ImClone Chief</TE>
<TE>   Pleads Not Guilty</TE>
<TE>   ImClone Systems Inc. founder and former Chief Executive Samuel D.
Waksal pleaded not guilty to insider trading, bank fraud, perjury and
obstruction-of-justice charges in connection with an alleged scheme
to dump shares of the company days before regulators rejected its
highly touted new cancer drug.</TE>
<TE>   The indictment included previous allegations by a federal grand
jury of destroying documents, lying to investigators and putting up
the same collateral for two different bank loans.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, his former company filed suit against him, claiming he
ordered the destruction of documents that may be important to a
government investigation.</TE>
<TE>   ImClone said it is demanding that Waksal return $7 million paid in
severance when he resigned in May amid accusations he tipped off
relatives about the government's rejection of the company's
experimental cancer drug, Erbitux, before the news was made public.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Federated Joins Boycott of Myanmar</TE>
<TE>   Federated Department Stores said it cut its ties to Myanmar,
handing human rights activists a victory in their fight to unseat the
country's military regime.</TE>
<TE>   Federated, owner of Bloomingdale's and Macy's, joined 29 other
companies that have agreed not to sell products bearing the "Made in
Myanmar" label, according to the Free Burma Coalition, the
Washington-based nonprofit that organized the boycott campaign.</TE>
<TE>   A Federated spokeswoman said its decision to quit selling goods
produced in Myanmar, formerly known as Burma, was made because "what
is going on there is a violation of the philosophy and spirit of our
vendor supplier code of conduct."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Idealab Shareholders Take Aim at Exemption</TE>
<TE>   A group of Idealab Inc.'s investors asked the Securities and
Exchange Commission to rescind the firm's exemption from rules
governing investment companies, a move that could force the Pasadena
Internet incubator to return some of the hundreds of millions of
dollars the investors gave it.</TE>
<TE>   The move is the latest salvo in the increasingly bitter battle
between Idealab and owners of its so-called preferred shares.</TE>
<TE>   The group includes more than three dozen mutual funds, investment
partnerships, companies and individuals.</TE>

<LD>I am extremely impressed with the accomplishments made by the Dream
Center in such a short time ("On Faith Alone," by Bob Emmers, July
21). However, the article incorrectly refers to the church as part of
the New Church Movement. Wasn't Jesus' message and service to render
a helping hand to the sick, poor and homeless? Did he not feed and
comfort them? I feel Pastor Matthew Barnett has created what we
should call the "Old Church"--one that is truly doing the work that
God/Jesus wanted his followers to do. Just look at the salary Barnett
receives, and you can see he's not there for the money. If others
would follow his example, I believe we could feed the poor, shelter
the homeless and solve a multitude of problems that society does not
want to deal with.</LD>

<TE>   Thanks for the great article on the Dream Center. I visited a
couple of months ago and loved it! The inside was filled with the
most remarkable human tapestry. The unity in the room isn't something
I can describe in writing; it has to be experienced. I will say,
however, that it heightened my understanding of God. The front two
rows were filled with Los Angeles police officers. They were invited
to be honored by the church, and as they were called to the stage,
the congregation spontaneously rose and applauded. Kind words of
appreciative support were offered and prayers filled the room.</TE>

<TE>   What an incredible story! I am overjoyed that a single decision
made by one man to become a blessing to his community has mobilized
such monumental change in so short a period of time. This man and his
congregation, with its service-based worship, are truly serving the
world.</TE>

<LD>Anne-Marie O'Connor's article ("Seduction of a Generation," July 28)
hit home. Why doesn't your paper, or any other in this country, write
an article about the good things and hard-working people in Tijuana?
Why don't you find out about all of the excellent students who have
graduated from Instituto Mexico--those who have established
businesses and are productive members of society; those who create
jobs, keep our country growing, participate in their community and
give back to the community? Why don't you write about the tens of
thousands of young people, on both sides of the border, who go to
Tijuana for productive purposes, such as building homes,
education-exchange programs, and sports and cultural events? We only
hear about the few who married wrong, are into drugs, get into
trouble and go to Tijuana to drink.</LD>

<LD>I was delighted to read Steve Lopez's excellent piece on the
prodigiously talented Jack Sheldon ("Last of the Hepcats," July 28).
There is no jazzman more deserving of recognition than this virtuoso
triple threat. Beautiful music pours out of him.</LD>
<LD>   There is one point, however, on which Lopez and I differ:
Sheldon's singing is as wonderful as his playing. It adds a level of
soulful expression to his performance that no one else matches. His
voice and singing style are inimitable. Thank you for this endearing
feature on a versatile artist who is too often overlooked.</LD>

<LD>I was afraid to read the article "No Stray Is Too Mangy for a St.
Francis of the Mean Streets" (by Daniel Guss, Metropolis, July 28)
because I saw the photo and its caption first. But after glancing at
the headline, I knew it was going to be positive. Animal control
officer Armando J. Navarrette is a saint, that's for sure. His words
parallel what I and other animal supporters believe: Animals in
danger are the result of a person who either beat them, neglected
them, didn't spay or neuter them, or just stopped caring about them.</LD>

<HD>A Poolful of Guppies and Wails</HD>
<DH>Marjean Tinoco sends them into the water crying--but they
come out swimmers</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LISA LEFF</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Little children cry when they meet Marjean Tinoco. They arch their
backs, kick their chubby legs and shriek, "No, Mommy, no!" as she
reaches for them with outstretched arms. Eyes wide with fright, they
recoil and hide their faces while she asks their names, their pets'
names, their favorite stuffed animals' names, anything to break the
ice.</LD>
<LD>   Marjean--like Madonna and Jewel, she lives strictly on a
first-name basis--doesn't take any of this personally. She has been a
swimming instructor for 50 years, and "screamers," as she calls her
more panicky pupils, go with the territory. Ignoring the pleas and
protests, she calmly carries a new group of 20-odd whimpering
toddlers and preschoolers into the pool one at a time and sends them
gliding face down through the water with a gentle nudge on the head.</LD>
<LD>   "Yeah! You did it! Give me a high-five," she says to a 2-year-old
boy wearing a disposable swim diaper who gamely slaps the hand raised
in front of his still-quivering lower lip. "No tears in my magic
pool," she chides a 3-year-old girl in a rainbow-colored tank suit
who gets submerged mid-scream, surfaces without a splutter and then
immediately resumes yelling for her mother.</LD>
<TE>   When another moon-faced girl of about 3 attempts to flee, Marjean
plucks her from the stairs, places the child on her back and tells
her to hold on tight. "I love you," she murmurs. "Now stop crying.
You're scaring everybody." With the girl still clinging to her neck,
she grabs two more reluctant recruits and launches their prone bodies
toward one of her assistants.</TE>
<TE>   And so it goes for the next hour. By the end of their maiden
class, few of the kids are still crying. Many of them are exhausted.
All of them know who's in charge. "If you don't get their heads under
the first day, you lose them," Marjean says, dismissing the plaintive
scene with a shrug of her deeply tanned shoulders. "They're crying
anyway, and by the third day, they are going to like it, and they are
even going to like me."</TE>
<TE>   In Ventura County, where she has lived since 1968, Marjean's work
with the young and the fearful has made her a local legend. Adults
who remember learning to float at her side--and the lollipops she
doles out at the end of each class--bring their own children to her
when they are ready for lessons. She has taught through six
pregnancies, two divorces, the births of seventeen grandchildren and
11 U.S. presidencies without ever taking a year off.</TE>
<TE>   Babies--she'll start them as young as 2 weeks of age--are her
specialty.</TE>
<TE>   Although she has worked in country-club pools, amusement-park
pools, and pools located in the backyards of private homes, Marjean's
base of operations for the last five years has been the Wagon Wheel
Motel, a kitschy turquoise lodge off the Ventura Freeway in Oxnard.
The motel's owners offered to give her exclusive use of their
paw-shaped pool, which had been condemned by state health officials,
four days a week if she paid to fix it up. She keeps the water
warm--between 90 and 95 degrees--to help soothe the kids' nerves, and
charges $165 for the first eight hours of instruction. Marjean's
Swimland is open nine months a year, and during the summer its owner
spends 11 hours a day in the water, often without a break. She
presents quite a picture: this 66-year-old grandmother in a
blue-and-white gingham one-piece who is both strict taskmaster and
reassuring presence. She has a gap-toothed smile, lank,
shoulder-length hair that chlorine has streaked a waxy shade of
yellow, and an ample, pear-shaped figure just right for riding
piggyback. Whether cajoling, encouraging or scolding, she speaks in
the languid drawl of someone who is permanently on vacation.</TE>
<TE>   Going After Results</TE>
<TE>   "Marjean is a low-blood-pressure kind of person," observes Tami
Holland, who enrolled her 5-year-old son and 4-year-old daughter in
Marjean's school this summer. "She has an aggressive approach without
an aggressive attitude, and that is how she gets results."</TE>
<TE>   To be sure, it takes a certain level of determination--not to
mention emotional detachment--to submit one's offspring to Marjean's
swim-or-sink methods. On a recent Monday, the day she starts her new
classes, a 4-year-old Ventura girl named Carina was sprawled fully
dressed on the concrete next to the pool. When Marjean asked why she
wasn't in the water with the other guppies, the girl's mother,
Elizabeth Felix, explained that Carina refused to take her clothes
off.</TE>
<TE>   "Who's the adult here, Mom?" Marjean said, meaningfully raising
her eyebrows. Felix hurriedly peeled off her daughter's clothes to
reveal her bathing suit and plunked the yelping girl on the steps.
"She'll be my best swimmer. You wait and see," Marjean called merrily
as she planted Carina on her back and moved away from the edge. After
one thwarted escape and several loud assertions of "I want to go
home!," the girl, still hooked onto Marjean's hips, settled into
sad-eyed silence.</TE>
<TE>   Nearby, other mothers sat reading paperbacks or chatting on
plastic chairs. A few were in the pool playing with babies who had
started with Marjean as infants and could already jump into the
water, swim a few feet and grasp the side with their tiny hands. It
was all a bit much for Felix. "I'm ready to rip my hair out, throw
up, pull her out of the pool and go home," she sighed. "But it will
be over soon."</TE>
<TE>   Her tough-love style and insistence on having kids go underwater
right away has earned Marjean her share of detractors. Some parents
walk away after the first day, concluding that they'd rather invest
in another pair of floaties than endure the tears. Instructor Brad
Allen says that before he joined the Swimland staff three years ago,
other swimming teachers told him Marjean was "too mean." Allen agrees
that although Marjean's approach is unconventional--"You would never
go to the Y and hear them tell a kid, 'You better just do it,' "--he
argues that you can't quarrel with her success.</TE>
<TE>   For her part, Marjean knows what her reputation is and she doesn't
object to it. "I agree I'm a stern teacher, even with little
children," she says. In fact, her own children call her "Mean Marjean
the Swimming Machine."</TE>
<TE>   More than anything else, Swimland's beginners program is designed
to get children acclimated to the water. For the first two weeks, new
students attend class for an hour a day, four days a week. The
lessons consist primarily of their getting passed back and forth
between Marjean and one of her assistants, with rudimentary kicking,
paddling and floating skills added as they gain confidence holding
their breath and keeping their eyes open. By their last day of the
eight-lesson course, which takes place over two weeks, they are
expected to jump into the deep end and make their way to the side of
the pool.</TE>
<TE>   Taking Baby Steps</TE>
<TE>   The American Red Cross, which developed the swimming course used
at most public pools, has similar aims for its infant and preschool
aquatics program. But the means by which they are achieved differ
from those at Marjean's school. Forcing a fearful child to enter the
pool, for instance, is not part of the Red Cross lesson plan, and
neither is submerging a child who is crying.</TE>
<TE>   "If you are doing that, you are drowning your child. It's not a
positive reinforcement," said Lourdes del Rio-Valdes, a spokeswoman
for the Red Cross' Greater Los Angeles chapter. Instead, the
organization advocates encouraging new swimmers to take baby
steps--starting out with splashing their faces and blowing bubbles
with just their mouths underwater until they are ready to put their
whole faces in.</TE>
<TE>   Many parents who have entrusted their children to Marjean's
ministrations, however, said they were willing to endure the
discomfort of hearing their kids so unhappy for the sake of making
them safer around water, an objective that was given new urgency in
June when a 7-year-old boy drowned at a Holmby Hills pool party.
After hearing his mother's stories of how Marjean taught him to swim
when he was 4 months old, Eric Gates, 30, of Ventura, enrolled his
17-month-old daughter, Lauren, in her school this summer. "I don't
consider her water-safe, but she can hold her breath for half a
minute now. If she fell in, it would be time enough for someone to
get her," he said.</TE>
<TE>   But though drowning is the leading cause of death among 1-to
2-year-olds in such warm-weather states as California, Texas,
Florida, and Arizona, the American Academy of Pediatrics does not
recommend formal swim instruction for children under 4. Until that
age, youngsters do not have the motor skills necessary to become
proficient swimmers, and preschool aquatics programs may give both
children and their parents a false and potentially dangerous sense of
security, according to the academy.</TE>
<TE>   For her part, Marjean thinks the Red Cross approach "is falling
short" by failing to make children do something they can in fact do.
"All children want to swim, and they feel they can't swim unless we
push them," she said, adding that with her technique of skimming
students along the surface in a flat position, children actually take
in less water than with the Red Cross' vertical immersion method.</TE>
<TE>   She is equally comfortable writing off the views of the nation's
pediatric establishment. "A lot of children drown before the age of
4, and so you want them to be able to go across that pool and know
what they are doing," she says.</TE>
<TE>   As with most authorities on a subject, Marjean traces her devotion
to her chosen career to her own childhood experiences. When she was
5, she contracted polio and spent the next three years relearning to
walk wearing leg braces. Her mother died when she was 10, and the
religious grandmother who helped raise her after that taught her to
challenge herself. "When I said I couldn't walk, Grandma would swat
me on the butt and say, 'In Jesus' name you will walk,' " she says.</TE>
<TE>   Because polio was thought to be a waterborne disease, however,
Marjean, who lived in a small town in Oregon, wasn't allowed to swim
until she was 15. Her first instructor, a handsome man seven years
her senior, told her she would never be much of a swimmer because she
lacked coordination. To prove him wrong, she set out to earn her Red
Cross certification and within a year was giving lessons herself. At
18, she married her former instructor, and they opened their first
swimming school.</TE>
<TE>   Days Spent in the Water</TE>
<TE>   She has spent her days standing in 3 1/2 feet of water ever since.
"The day my youngest son was born I taught 12 hours, and four days
later I taught 12 hours with him in the water right with me," she
says. These days, she occasionally thinks about retiring but says she
hasn't yet found a successor who is as comfortable working with
babies and toddlers as she is. "To stay in the water as long as I do
you would think I was nuts, but I love it so much, I don't want to
get out," she says.</TE>
<TE>   As it turned out, Marjean's predictions about the trajectory of
her students' progress--from unwilling captives to happy
splashers--proved mostly correct. By her third day, Carina walked
into the pool without a backward glance and sat on the steps
patiently playing with some plastic pool toys. "She's like a
different kid," the girl's mother said with obvious relief. A short
distance away, a 6-year-old boy who had been among the most
vociferous of Monday's screamers still looked scared but contentedly
yielded to the teacher's embrace.</TE>
<TE>   There was one holdout, however, a 3-year-old girl who sobbed when
she was on the pool's edge, sobbed when she was on Marjean's back,
sobbed when she was playing on the steps with another girl. Marjean
shrugged and pulled her close. "Your turn, phony baloney," she said,
sending her off to another instructor and catching her on the return
trip. "You did it! Yeah! Give me a kiss?" The girl complied, and
then--still sobbing--scanned the pool area for her mother. "Mommy,
did you see me?" she called. "Can I get out now?"</TE>

<HD>The Black Bear, Monrovia's 500-Pound Gorilla</HD>
<DH>The foothill town east of Los Angeles has an affectionate,
if cautious, relationship with its numerous bruins</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RENEE TAWA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Just a few miles from the local Starbucks, not far from the day spa
in Monrovia, the city's unofficial bear tracker steers her pickup
truck down a winding street lined with incense cedar trees,
wildflowers and wood-frame houses. Twenty miles east of downtown Los
Angeles, Kim Bosell is scanning the roads and foothills for Little
Girl, a 225-pound black bear and neighborhood regular. On this sunny
morning, Little Girl is likely to amble right down the paved street
and crawl under a house for a nap or steal loquats from a neighbor's
tree. "We're liable to run into the bear today," says Bosell, who
works for the city's parks division. "She's always up here. This is
her territory."</LD>
<LD>   Bosell tracks the movements of bears in Monrovia, studying their
habits and personalities as if they were gang members, she jokes. She
knows them by their distinctive markings and the names given to them
by park workers or residents. If she sees a bear, Bosell--5 feet 4
and a fresh-faced 30--will run after it. Sometimes the bear will flee
back into the foothills; other times, the bear and Bosell will square
off. It's an uneasy match: Black bears can weigh more than 500
pounds.</LD>
<TE>   From June to November, homeowners near the foothills expect to see
bears lumbering into this city of 37,000 people, where the median
price for a single-family home is $315,000. But this summer, bear
sightings are up, probably because of the long dry spell, city
officials say. Bears and other wildlife head down from the foothills
that abut the city and the nearby Angeles National Forest, presumably
frustrated by the search for berries, grass and water in their own
habitat. One coyote wandered into Monrovia and bit through a
sprinkler line to get to water.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier this month, as a temporary response to the prolonged lack
of rain, city officials decided to try a new tactic to discourage
wildlife visits. Firefighters positioned six donated water troughs
along hillside trails, hoping that the extra water source will keep
thirsty animals from venturing elsewhere. The 156-gallon aluminum
containers will be filled periodically by firefighters and monitored
by Bosell, who will note the water level along with any nearby paw
prints and droppings.</TE>
<TE>   The bears simply are part of the everyday consciousness of
homeowners in the foothills, and have come to the fore recently as TV
news crews have headed to Monrovia to capture the strange sight of a
bear lingering for hours in a tree.</TE>
<TE>   Most residents adjust to the bear intrusions, installing motion
detectors that alert them when one is near, keeping pepper spray on
hand with the safety latch unhooked and devising ways to thwart
garbage scavengers (one homeowner freezes food scraps such as salmon
skins and chicken bones to get rid of the scent).</TE>
<TE>   For the most part, the city considers the bears with wary
affection, delighted by the connection to the wilderness, mindful of
potential problems. "It's a long-term relationship," Bosell says.
"That's just it. It's not going to end. It's always going to be
something we're dealing with, and we just have to keeping coming up
with new ways to do it."</TE>
<TE>   Even residents who never see bears in Monrovia can't miss signs of
their presence in the city. Check out the telephone poles, which
bears use as scratching posts. The bears back up against the post to
rub an itch, leaving behind tufts of fur. On the night before garbage
pickups are scheduled, overturned trash cans litter some streets.</TE>
<TE>   A statue of Monrovia's most famous bear, Samson, was dedicated in
March at the city's Canyon Park nature center. In 1994 the 500-pound
bear became famous for taking regular dips in a Monrovia resident's
hot tub, apparently to soothe his arthritis. State Department of Fish
and Game officials captured Samson, who was deemed a nuisance and
scheduled to be killed.</TE>
<TE>   But in response to a public outcry, then-Gov. Pete Wilson decided
to spare the bear, who died last year at the Orange County Zoo. The
Samson statue is "dedicated to the protection, understanding and
respect for wildlife and their habitat."</TE>
<TE>   Ever since a homeowner's videotape of Samson made the news--he
looked like a big, happy kid, splashing around--residents have had a
heightened sensitivity about issues related to their environment. But
city officials also are careful to draw a line. Two years ago, in an
effort to make sure that locals do not encourage visits by bears and
other animals, the City Council approved an ordinance prohibiting the
feeding of wildlife. And city fliers remind residents that if bears
get used to digging through trash cans, the animals could become
bolder and break into homes for food, for instance. Fish and Game
officials kill aggressive bears that could threaten humans.</TE>
<TE>   "Nobody wants to see that," says Paul Larsen, 39, a board member
of the Monrovia Mountains Conservancy. "There is no call whatsoever
to have radical efforts to eliminate the bear problem....The people
of Monrovia are willing to do whatever it takes to make sure there's
a peaceful coexistence."</TE>
<TE>   Larsen, who lives with his wife and two small children near the
foothills, isn't scared of the "very polite" bear that recently
pulled a bag out of his garbage can and poked around for trash
without making a huge mess. Although the family is visited by other
wild animals, "the bears are more interesting because of all the
folklore that goes along with the bear. And they look fuzzy and
cuddly. Of course they're not, but they have that sort of a mystique
about them."</TE>
<TE>   In July 2000, 77% of the city's voters supported a $9.5-million
property tax to help buy the adjoining hillsides for a wilderness
preserve. The preserve is expected to total 1,100 acres, protecting
an uninterrupted wildlife corridor from the national forest and
keeping 81 potential new homes off the foothills--the habitat from
which the bears wander.</TE>
<TE>   In a typical season, Monrovia reports more bear sightings than any
other city in Los Angeles County, city officials say. Maybe the bears
are tempted by the natural springs and the trees that are laden with
avocados, plums and peaches, Bosell says. Or maybe, she speculates,
the bears simply are skirting the housing developments that are
creeping higher and higher into the neighboring foothills of the San
Gabriel Valley.</TE>
<TE>   At any rate, this summer Bosell is spending about 25% of her time
on the bears, up from past years because of the increase in
sightings. Bosell, who is based at Canyon Park in the foothills, has
been fielding more requests to drop by homes and recommend ways that
residents can minimize intrusions by bears. Some homeowners, for
instance, board up the space under their decks, the kind of dark,
cool area that bears like. Once, Bosell found that a bear had tucked
away six months' worth of trash beneath someone's deck.</TE>
<TE>   Bosell also is giving more talks than usual about bear behavior to
groups such as the city's mail carriers. Parents in particular ask
how dangerous the animals are, Bosell says. City officials say no
bear has ever attacked a person in Monrovia. A female bear might try
to defend her cubs, but otherwise, bears usually show no interest in
people. "The bears aren't walking around wanting to eat your kids for
dinner," Bosell says.</TE>
<TE>   Police haven't totaled their nightly bear calls, but sightings
appear to be up, says Capt. Terry Dochnahl. On some nights, residents
report two or three sightings. "Rarely is there a night that we won't
get a call," Dochnahl says. (State Department of Fish and Game
officials do not have statewide tallies yet either, a spokesman
says.)</TE>
<TE>   Often, by the time the police show up, the bear has moved on. If
it's still hanging around, officers will try to scare it off by
shooting it with a stinging beanbag round that also makes a loud
noise. And police sometimes turn to Bosell for help.</TE>
<TE>   "She's an invaluable resource," Dochnahl says. "She's much more
knowledgeable about the wildlife than we are in the Police
Department."</TE>
<TE>   On this afternoon, Bosell drives to the city's northeast side to
check a "bear-be-gone" trash can that she left on a neighbor's
driveway. The can is baited with an aromatic treat such as a roll of
pork doused with liquid smoke and rigged to shoot pepper spray when a
bear reaches for the offering. This time, though, it looks like only
raccoons and ants have gotten into the bait bag.</TE>
<TE>   The homeowner, Susan Motander, says she doesn't resent the bears'
dropping by her three-acre property once a week or so. "I moved into
the wilderness," says Motander, who inherited her 900-square-foot
redwood house from her grandmother. "So I have to accept the fact
there will be wild animals. I have to live with them." And she can't
let her guard down, the way she did one hot day last May.</TE>
<TE>   Motander, 47, had left the back door open and the screen door
shut. She heard what she thought was the sound of clicking noises on
the kitchen floor. Her husband wasn't home. Oh, that's the dog, she
thought, heading to the kitchen--where she came face to face with a
bear. Motander remembered what Bosell had told her about bear
encounters: "Be brave and look big." So she screamed the only thing
she could think of: "You're a bear!" Then she opened the screen door,
and the bear ran out.</TE>
<TE>   Bears also hang out in Motander's avocado orchard, lobbing the
pits at each other, and on her terrace, twirling on the metal hand
railing as if it were a jungle gym. Motander and other residents tell
Bosell story after story about the bears, like the ones who jump in
their pools--the chlorine helps get rid of ticks and fleas. One of
the city's regulars is Little Girl, who recently broke into
Motander's basement, probably to escape the heat and catch some
sleep.</TE>
<TE>   Little Girl is cinnamon-colored, with a blond face and a
triangular white blaze on her chest. Bosell also has tracked Little
Girl's mother, Blaze, whom she hasn't seen recently. "Her mom was a
first-generation trash can bear," Bosell says. "She's a
second-generation trash can bear."</TE>
<TE>   Little Girl is used to the sounds of urban life, such as traffic,
and recently has stopped scuttling away when she hears Bosell's
raised voice: "She looks at you like, 'Whaaaaat?' " If Bosell runs
after her, Little Girl acts as if she's fleeing back to the
foothills; then she sneaks back to her original spot. And Bosell will
be right there. At that point, Little Girl usually gives up and
leaves the neighborhood.</TE>
<TE>   Other bears can be frightened off by noise, such as yelling,
jangling key chains or popping open a soda can. If that doesn't work,
and Bosell, who is unarmed, chases after them, in most cases, the
surprised bears lumber off. "They all have different facial
expressions," she notes with a laugh. "They kind of look at you like,
'Huh? Do you realize what's going on here?' And you get all this
really, really comical stuff going on with these guys."</TE>
<TE>   Not that Bosell doesn't take the potential dangers seriously. She
watches for signs that tell her when a bear is about to charge. An
angry bear will chomp its teeth, moan, snap its jaw and stamp its
feet. "When the situation turns around," she says, "they'll let me
know." Experts advise people not to run away because this can spur
the bear to give chase. Also, according to Fish and Game officials,
no human can outrun a bear. But twice, Bosell has fled from a bear
because there was no alternative. In both cases she made it to
safety. She thinks her days playing soccer keep her speedy.</TE>
<TE>   Maybe she isn't scared of bears because she has worked with
animals all her life, muses Bosell. Growing up in the Indiana
countryside, she caught snakes with her brothers and reared baby
deer. In a previous job, working for the city of Arcadia, she became
intrigued by the issue of bears in the foothills and the way each of
them has its own personality.</TE>
<TE>   On most days at Canyon Park, Bosell leads hikes for children or
sets up interpretive displays at the nature center. During bear
season, she is on Little Girl's trail.</TE>
<TE>   On this morning Bosell drives by Little Girl's hangouts. She
points out a drainage pipe in someone's frontyard. A neighbor had
insisted that a bear was living inside the pipe, but Bosell was
skeptical; the space was too tight. "So I started crawling in there
and went, 'Woooo, there's a bear in here!' " Bosell backed up, and
Little Girl came flying out. She isn't around today, but she's bound
to turn up soon.</TE>
<TE>   Little Girl is 3, which means that she'll be of breeding age next
June, ready to raise a new generation of trash can cubs. The
possibility keeps Bosell hopping, on call for emergencies throughout
the season, willing to wait 11 hours until a bear comes down from a
tree. Bosell, who is engaged to be married, has a 10-year-old
daughter who she sometimes takes with her on bear calls.</TE>
<TE>   Recently Bosell told her mother that, sorry, she can never move
back home to Indiana. The state doesn't have any bears.</TE>

<HD>Velvet Reigns as Proper Setting for The King</HD>
<DH>An art expert says cheesy images of Elvis on dark fabric
create a 'powerful emotional message.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ANNIE GROER</AU>
<BD>WASHINGTON POST</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Just days after the 25th anniversary of The King's alleged death--how
else to explain all those posthumous "sightings" in laundromats and
7-Elevens?--I must make a confession.</LD>
<LD>   I own three large paintings of Elvis on velvet.</LD>
<LD>   "Velvises," I call them.</LD>
<TE>   And I cherish each interpretation of His Presleyness: full-length,
in a studded, white jumpsuit that glimmers like plastic and clings
like sausage casing; in profile, with double-wide sideburns vanishing
below a rakishly upturned collar; and--my favorite--head-on, a carpet
of chest hair visible under a jean jacket open to the waist and
trailing buckskin laces.</TE>
<TE>   In the interest of accuracy, however, none is on genuine velvet
but rather some indeterminate cheesy, low-pile fabric. Moreover, at
least one image appears to be silk-screened, not hand-painted,
presumably in the service of speed and uniformity.</TE>
<TE>   Although clearly created by different artists, my three portraits
have several things in common. None is signed. All cost less than $25
at flea markets. And all are framed in crudely carved wood of the
sort found in Tijuana art marts that specialize in paintings of
voluptuous naked babes and high-wattage cultural icons such as JFK,
Bob Marley and Princess Di.</TE>
<TE>   While velvet (velveteen, velour, suede cloth) becomes each of
these personages, it is an especially splendid medium for Presley
portraiture, says Gary Vikan, director of Baltimore's Walters Art
Museum and self-described scholar of Byzantine art and Elvis.</TE>
<TE>   "Black velvet has a baroque pathos. The figure kind of disappears
in the darkness behind it or comes out of shadow," says Vikan,
likening luminous Elvii to Caravaggio's 16th and 17th century
paintings of saints.</TE>
<TE>   Vikan, in fact, once taught a course at Johns Hopkins University
called "Holy Through the Ages: Early Christian Saints Through Elvis."
And at term's end, students and prof repaired to Miss Bonnie's Elvis
Shrine Bar and Literary Salon in Baltimore, which had boasted two
Velvises amid assorted Presleyana until it closed in 1993.</TE>
<TE>   "There is no better way to create a powerful emotional message,"
says Vikan, because black velvet produces "a kind of immediate Vegas
lighting quality for those who knew him from that theatrical
aspect--the after-dark Elvis. He is a blue-collar guy, and this is a
blue-collar art idiom. It's a match."</TE>
<TE>   Although it may seem a stretch to compare obscure Mexican artists
with a master such as Caravaggio, painting on velvet has a long
artistic tradition. The luxuriant fabric appeared as far back as 9th
century France, although it might have been invented in Italy or
Persia, says Doris Hendershot, a library assistant at the Textile
Museum in Washington. Velvet came to China--possibly from Persia via
Central Asia--during the Yuan Dynasty (1279-1368).</TE>
<TE>   Marco Polo found examples of velvet painting in the 14th century
during his travels to Kashmir, notes Cristina Ochoa, director of the
Galeria Otra Vez in Los Angeles, which last spring celebrated the art
form with an exhibit of 10 artists, titled "Black Velvet Kruise."
(One enormous contemporary work by Peter Alexander is valued at
$75,000, she says.)</TE>
<TE>   Apparently brought to this country after the Revolutionary War,
the paintings featured fruit, flowers, romantic landscapes and
biblical scenes done in a mixture of water colors and gum, she says.</TE>
<TE>   In the mid-20th century, a number of artists took it up. But the
man considered the father of modern velvet painting-- and dubbed by
admirers "the American Gauguin"--was Edgar Leeteg. A sign painter who
settled in Papeete, Tahiti, in the 1930s, he began doing portraits on
monk's cloth. When the local store ran out, the clerk sold him a bolt
of velvet, says Ochoa. And the rest is art history.</TE>
<TE>   During the next two decades, Leeteg turned out some 1,000 velvet
paintings, many depicting manly warriors or bare-breasted Tahitian
women. He sold the works directly to tourists (or traded them for
booze) and through a dealer in Hawaii until his death in 1953. Today
an original Leeteg velvet can fetch $10,000, said Ochoa.</TE>
<TE>   By the 1950s, velvet paintings, which also were being made in the
Philippines, graced the walls of countless tiki-themed American rec
rooms and restaurants, brought home by tourists and GIs.</TE>
<TE>   Sailors based in San Diego sometimes took their exotic art into
Mexico for replication, says Ochoa. It didn't take long for local
painters in other tourist towns such as Acapulco and Ciudad Juarez to
see the possibilities of velvet.</TE>
<TE>   "There were a lot of people who worked in that medium in the '60s,
'70s and early '80s" says Cecelia Navarro Garcia, coordinator of
plastic arts at the Instituto de la Cultura de Baja California in
Tijuana. "People came from the States and asked for paintings in that
medium. Some wanted women with no clothes, which was a taboo. Others
said, 'I like black people, or Marilyn Monroe or Elvis Presley.' The
good thing was that there were about 300 painters, and everybody had
different things to paint," says Navarro, who recently organized a
monthlong exhibition of Mexican and American velvet artists.</TE>
<TE>   One of them was self-taught painter Daniel P. Marquez, 47, who
lives in Whittier, Calif., but who nearly three decades ago sat in a
Ciudad Juarez tourist shop window creating up to 10 Velvises a day
for $3 each. "You really cannot draw with pencil on black velvet, so
I used soap that I sharpened. I always put the white suit with
rhinestones, and I did all the details, the texture, with a razor
knife," says Marquez.</TE>
<TE>   Today's demand for Velvises has inspired several U.S.
entrepreneurs to mine the genre. Presley fan Helmut Kerling, better
known as San Diego deejay Gary Cocker, runs a thriving side business
at www.velvetelvis.com, which began five years ago as a class project
in Web site design.</TE>
<TE>   Kerling offers fans several images. When he has enough orders, he
picks them up in Tijuana. "I am looking for quality here," he says.
"I didn't want any bum velvet Elvises. So I went for the silk-screen
ones because they are more consistent."</TE>
<TE>   But, he confesses: "I just think they are about as tacky as
everybody else does."</TE>

<BD>WASHINGTON POST</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When Julie and William Heflin moved into a spacious new home last
year, the four children were tucked into only two of the house's six
bedrooms. Close quarters, the parents figured, would foster life
lessons in sharing and cooperation.</LD>
<LD>   "My husband's one of 13 children," Julie Heflin said. "For him,
it's a matter of principle for the kids to share, and they don't
mind." On weekends, she said, their three boys and one girl, ages 11
to 4, sometimes pile into one bedroom.</LD>
<LD>   Experts in child development would say the Heflins are on to
something, and many suggest that other families with space to spare
consider doubling up the kids, at least for a while.</LD>
<TE>   "Children who share rooms learn a lot about give and take. It can
be early training for college, for jobs and for marriage," said
Patricia Dalton, a clinical psychologist in Washington. "Kids have to
learn to work things out on their own, and what better place to do it
than their rooms?"</TE>
<TE>   There are benefits for the rest of the family too. Space gained
when children share a bedroom can be put to other uses, such as a
quiet zone where parents or kids can read, work or just watch a few
minutes of TV alone.</TE>
<TE>   "The extra bedroom can be made into an away room, a retreat for
parents and children," said North Carolina architect Sarah Susanka,
author of "The Not So Big House," a 1998 bestseller that has made her
something of a celebrity on the subject of living well in less space.
"It can become a place where you can close the door for quiet
activities or for the TV."</TE>
<TE>   Many parents put each child in a separate room without giving the
issue much thought. Of American families with children, eight in 10
have one or two younger than 18. And the average home in this country
has three bedrooms, according to 2000 census data.</TE>
<TE>   George Scarlett, chairman of the Eliot-Pearson Department of Child
Development at Tufts University in Medford, Mass., said one of the
striking differences between American culture and most others is the
way we segregate children from adults.</TE>
<TE>   "Other cultures think we're almost abusive in the way we put
children in separate bedrooms at night," Scarlett said. "Family beds
are commonplace in other parts of the world. Shared rooms are
certainly the norm."</TE>
<TE>   After they start sleeping through the night, babies are perfectly
suitable roommates for older siblings. "Sharing a room eases certain
issues for children--feelings of aloneness or isolation. It can help
them with their sense of attachment and security," Scarlett said.</TE>
<TE>   The kids might need to negotiate about which shelves will house
whose dolls and Legos, but in the process they'll learn to
acknowledge another's needs, possessions and wants.</TE>
<TE>   And as the Heflin family hopes, sharing space can trim any budding
notions of entitlement, as children work out conflicting schedules,
and different needs. "It doesn't always go smoothly," Julie Heflin
said. "My husband and I still laugh about the masking tape that
divided his space from his brothers' when they were little."</TE>
<TE>   Architect Susanka said there are many tricks parents can use to
create a sense of privacy in a single room. She suggests placing a
fort made of sheets in the middle to divide the space. Personalized
chairs, a shimmery shower curtain, a folding screen or even a dresser
can be a divider.</TE>
<TE>   "Children are much more flexible than adults when it comes to
defining privacy," she said. "It's hard for adults to get out of
their preconceived notions about space and privacy, but children
naturally gravitate to cooler, smaller spaces. That's why they love
bunk beds."</TE>
<TE>   Even very small spaces can work as bedrooms. Susanka tells of one
family in which a teen wanted his own room, but there was no
affordable way to renovate. So the parents allowed him to create a
room in the attic. Though he's too tall to stand upright there, the
boy covered the walls with posters, put his mattress on the floor,
and made it work. "It bothers the parents a great deal that he can't
stand up," she said. "But their son loves it. He calls it his
cocoon."</TE>

<HD>A 30-Year Reunion With Her Inner Teen</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Sandy Banks</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Today, I get the blond streaks. Nothing too outlandish, just a
smattering of highlights to give my graying hair that sun-kissed look
that suggests days spent on the beach.</LD>
<LD>   Tomorrow, it's a facial--the first of my life--to erase the lines
and dark circles I have collected on the march from 17 to 47.</LD>
<LD>   Then, it's off for a manicure and pedicure and a final sweep
through the mall, in search of a red tank top for Spirit Night ("Wear
your school colors, classmates, to put that Fighting Eagle spirit on
display!") and a slinky party dress to show off the body I've been
working all summer to trim and tone.</LD>
<TE>   For weeks, I've been measuring the time until my high school class
reunion by the work I must do to create the new old me I want my
classmates to see. Now, there's time for just three more ab classes
and two workouts at the gym; just four more days to starve myself to
get closer to what I looked like 30 years ago.</TE>
<TE>   Thirty years ago. Could it really be that long?</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Maybe it's a sign of my aging brain, but I don't recognize most of
the names on the roster. And I can't seem to recollect the faces of
classmates who have signed up for this weekend's reunion of the John
F. Kennedy Class of 1972. I only hope that people will wear their
name tags and that the writing on them will be big enough for failing
eyes to read.</TE>
<TE>   Ours was a giant public school in Cleveland. Think "Boston Public"
with no white students. More than 900 kids started with me as
sophomores, and 600 made it to graduation. Most stayed on in
Cleveland; they went to work in factories, hospitals, government
offices, schools. Others went off to college and scattered--to
Atlanta, New York, Washington, Philadelphia.</TE>
<TE>   Folks who left the Midwest for California feel a special burden
upon our return--to look like movie stars, be rolling in dough,
dressed to the nines, driving fancy cars. Our more provincial
classmates greet us with condescension and awe: How do you survive in
that moral wasteland? What celebrities have you spotted lately? Don't
you miss the seasons and worry about earthquakes? How do you stand
that freeway traffic?</TE>
<TE>   This time I'll have questions of my own. How has my old boyfriend,
Walt--now a schoolteacher with a wife and six kids--held up? What
became of that cool clique of guys who used to cut class to play
cards in the Senior Lounge? And whatever happened to Saundra Curtis,
the girl who beat me out for the English award?</TE>
<TE>   And I'm bracing myself for the raised eyebrows that will greet me
and my date--my fiance Johnny. You see, this is Johnny's reunion as
well, and we're probably the least likely couple our classmates would
envision, given what they recall of us. We were friends back then,
never anything more. It took a chance meeting--after 25 years
apart--for us to see each other through different eyes. As teenagers,
he thought I was too square to be much fun. I figured he was too much
of a pretty boy ever to amount to much.</TE>
<TE>   Now it looks like we both were wrong ... or maybe we just like the
changes that life has inflicted as time moved us along.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   For months I took the stairs, turned down desserts, opted for a
trip to the gym instead of a drink after work. When anyone asked, my
explanation was simple and always understood. "My class reunion is
coming up" elicited a sympathetic "aahh."</TE>
<TE>   Something about reunions tends to spark a bit of angst in most of
us. There is something quite humbling about the prospect of a few
nights among folks who remember you as that skinny cheerleader with
long hair and glasses--that would be me at 17--long after you have
added curves, lopped off your trademark curls and traded your
spectacles for contact lenses.</TE>
<TE>   At their most benign, reunions are about reconnecting with
friends, reliving good times, resurrecting old memories. But they are
also a sort of measuring stick of how far we've come and how much--or
how little--we have changed. Few things prompt a bout of
self-evaluation like the expectation that everyone else will be
evaluating you too. Each increment on the reunion schedule has its
own set of hazards and perks. At the 10th, we're expected to strut
our stuff, far removed from the awkwardness of adolescence but not
yet bound by the ennui of middle age. By the 20th, emerging midlife
concerns have many looking to recapture their youth and rekindle old
relationships. Those reunion encounters are startling; we aren't
prepared to see classmates who look more like their parents than
their yearbook pictures.</TE>
<TE>   Thirty should be a piece of cake. There will be bald heads and
blond weaves, successes and failures, folks bragging about grandkids
and others toting toddlers. We all want to put our best face forward,
but there's little room, at this point, for pretense.</TE>
<TE>   It's a rare chance to be in one place with hundreds of others who
are all the same age. And if that evokes comparisons, it also reminds
us of something else we share: The feeling that, someplace inside us,
we ought to still be 17.</TE>

<LD>Champagne Salute</LD>
<LD>   Only the best would do. Their flutes filled with 1990 La Grande
Dame Veuve Clicquot, wine connoisseurs toasted Aleen Agranowitz and
Gladys Gleason, co-founders of the Speech and Language Development
Center in Buena Park, which serves 300 children each year.</LD>
<LD>   The champagne salute launched the 47-year-old center's second wine
auction, an alfresco benefit featuring the sale of more than 200 lots
that netted $150,000 for the center's programs for children with
language, learning and behavior difficulties.</LD>
<TE>   "As humans, we are a communicating people," Agranowitz said during
the event last Sunday at the South Coast Plaza Village Green in Santa
Ana. "We try to give children the means to make their wants known so
they can take their place in the world."</TE>
<TE>   More than 225 guests dined on Italian fare whipped up by Antonello
Ristorante--dishes included beef short ribs with honey, and grilled
swordfish with sauteed spinach--as they raised their paddles to bid
on vintage selections ranging from three bottles of 1978 Mondavi
Cabernet Sauvignon Reserve to three magnums of 1999 Cakebread Cellars
Napa Valley Chardonnay.</TE>
<TE>   The idea for the center's first wine auction two years ago came
after an anonymous donor gave the nonprofit organization "80
cases--that's about 1,000 bottles" of wine, said Newport Beach
attorney Jim Harker, benefit co-chairperson with his wife, Ilene. "We
sold it all--raised $100,000," he said. "We've been collecting fine
wines so we could do it again. We want this event to have all the
class of a Napa Valley wine auction."</TE>
<TE>   The rare $10,000 bottle of Silver Oak Alexander Valley Cabernet
Sauvignon was a no sale, but the osso buco dinner for 10 at the
Harkers' residence--served up with a double magnum of Pio Cesare
Barolo--set the evening's record bid at a hefty $4,000.</TE>

<TE>   Reel Cowboys</TE>
<TE>   She never dreamed she'd be a stand-in for her husband, but Jo-An
Turman got the chance when actor/cowboy Glynn Turman was recognized
for his community leadership at a benefit for the Western States
Black Research Education Center.</TE>
<TE>   Turman, who was unable to attend the event at the Autry Museum of
Western Heritage because of an out-of-state commitment, was honored
for founding Camp Gid D Up, a free, western-style summer camp for
inner city and at-risk kids. The inspiration for the camp came during
the L.A. riots in 1992, Jo-An Turman said. "We knew we had to find a
way to help kids get off the streets."</TE>
<TE>   Since then, nearly 1,000 children have made a weeklong visit to
the camp at the couple's 40-acre ranch outside Los Angeles. "We teach
them to ride, rope, swim, hike, do natural crafts," she said. "Not
every kid likes to play basketball or football--some just like to
ride horses. We expose them to the western way of living and,
possibly, a new career path."</TE>
<TE>   Turman accepted the Lifetime Achievement Award on behalf of her
husband during the awards dinner on Aug. 9 that kicked off the annual
Black Cowboy Film Festival.</TE>
<TE>   About 200 people attended the event, which raised $20,000 for the
research and education center, founded in 1972 by librarian Mayme A.
Clayton. Clayton owns a collection of more than 20,000 rare books,
documents, films and photographs on African American culture and
history, some of which she keeps in her Los Angeles home's garage and
some in professional storage facilities. "My dream is to have a
building to house these resources for the community," Clayton said.</TE>
<TE>   On Aug. 10, festivalgoers watched films such as "Thomasine &amp;
Bushrod" (starring Turman), "Cat Ballou" (Nat King Cole), "Cimarron"
(Eugene Jackson) and "Ride 'Em Cowboy" (Ella Fitzgerald).</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   La Dolce Vita</TE>
<TE>   It looked like a piazza in Italy, but a retail center courtyard
was the site of the "Ferragosto" benefit for the Orange County
Chapter of Childhelp USA.</TE>
<TE>   A huge canvas backdrop portraying burnt sienna, terra cotta and
ochre-colored buildings as seen in--"Oh, let's say Capri," said
co-chairwoman Christine Bren--set the scene for the alfresco dinner
party, which netted $45,000 for the organization's residential
treatment centers for abused and abandoned children.</TE>
<TE>   Held at Fashion Island in Newport Beach, the celebration is named
for an annual summer holiday in Italy when villagers gather in
piazzas to drink wine and share indigenous foods. "In the mountains
they feast on earthy foods--mushrooms, polenta, sausages," said
Stefano Albano, general manager of Tutto Mare, the restaurant
providing the fare for about 350 guests. "Along the coast, it's
mainly seafood. But no matter where it is, there is always good
wine."</TE>
<TE>   Delicacies at the Aug. 10 event included whole roast pig--ferried
before the crowd on a tray, stretcher-style, by proud chefs--lobster,
New York strip steak, poached salmon and jumbo prawns. The culinary
challenge: getting at the juicy lobster meat, sans nutcrackers, which
were not provided. Most guests wrestled with the hard shells, to no
avail. A few, such as Nancy Mallory, knew exactly what to do. "First,
you twist the tail off," she said, gripping the shell with her hands.
"Then you cut it down the middle and lift out the meat. My husband
taught me how to do this." A smug Scott Mallory added: "I used to
live in Boston."</TE>

<LD>Nathan and his brother, Brian, were going on vacation with their
parents. "We're going to Lake Morris," their father told them.</LD>
<LD>   "Cool," Nathan and Brian said together.</LD>
<LD>   They drove all day, and along about nightfall they arrived at
their hotel on the shore of Lake Morris. The next morning, Nathan and
Brian and their parents walked out onto the sand between the hotel
and the lake. Nathan and Brian built sand cities and splashed in the
water all day. They had a good time.</LD>
<TE>   A few days later, Nathan noticed that his skin was peeling. He lay
in bed pulling off long transparent pieces. Doing this didn't hurt,
but it did feel strange. Nathan was fascinated.</TE>
<TE>   After a few minutes he jumped onto Brian's bed and showed him what
he could do. Brian awoke immediately and found that he could pull off
shreds of his own skin, just as Nathan said.</TE>
<TE>   "Do you think we're going to become butterflies?" Nathan asked. "I
mean caterpillars shed their skin and become butterflies, don't they?
Maybe we're doing the same thing." He was not afraid of turning into
a butterfly. The thought excited him.</TE>
<TE>   "I never heard of that happening with people," Brian said.</TE>
<TE>   "Me neither," Nathan admitted. "But the world is full of stuff I
never heard of."</TE>
<TE>   Brian could only agree.</TE>
<TE>   At the end of the week, Nathan and Brian went home with their
parents.</TE>
<TE>   Gradually their tans faded and after a while it became impossible
to pull off dry bits of skin.</TE>
<TE>   "I guess we're not going to turn into butterflies, after all,"
Nathan said, disappointed.</TE>
<TE>   "I guess you're right," Brian agreed. "But being a kid isn't so
bad."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Back when author Mel Gilden was a kid, people were more interested
in tanning than in protecting their skin from the sun. When Gilden's
skin burned and he began to peel, he actually thought he might become
a butterfly. He is still disappointed that he didn't. This story will
be on The Times' Web site at</TE>

<DH>Seafood and Ocean Air Bring in the Crowds in Santa Monica</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>S. IRENE VIRBILA</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In Santa Monica, summer is a lifestyle. On balmy nights, tourists and
locals mingle on the palisades near the pier. The green strip
overlooking the ocean is the city's unofficial living room, where
people linger on park benches, stroll along the paths and enjoy the
sea breeze. If this were Europe, though, the palisades would be lined
with little seafood restaurants, ice cream stands and cafes.</LD>
<LD>   Along California's beaches, restaurants are so few and far between
that a seafront spot is a license to mint money. Restaurateurs don't
have to try very hard. Gladstone's, at the junction where Sunset
Boulevard runs into the Pacific Coast Highway, is one of the
highest-grossing restaurants west of the Mississippi.</LD>
<LD>   The other choice spot is the Lobster, at the top of the Santa
Monica Pier. On the site of a down-home lobster shack, this
contemporary American seafood restaurant is cantilevered over the
cliff, facing toward the pier and the mesmerizing lights of the
Ferris wheel. The location is such that the Lobster is packed day in
and day out with tourists and locals in search of seafood by the sea.
The scene at the indoor/outdoor bar sometimes looks like spring break
in Fort Lauderdale.</LD>
<TE>   Since it opened three years ago, the Lobster has been reconfigured
to incorporate what was once the outdoor-and quieter-balcony terrace
into the dining room. It has cut the deafening noise level just a
tad. With its rough wood rafters, wide open space and half-windows,
the sky partially screened by movable plastic flaps, the restaurant
looks like a loft or treehouse open to the breeze. "What's so great
about the view?" one of my guests commented the night we lucked into
a table by the window. We look down on a parking lot, the ungainly
tent-shaped building that houses the vintage carousel and, in the far
distance, the spinning Ferris wheel. Stadium lights shine right in
our eyes and highlight every smear and scar on the plastic curtain.
It's not lovely, but it's still a view. And there's that unmistakable
salt tang. Sea air makes you hungry. Has anybody done a study of
this? If not, they should.</TE>
<TE>   I can't imagine coming to the Lobster for a little salad or just a
bite or two. All around us in the clamorous dining room, people are
donning lobster bibs and wrestling with lobster shells, wresting
every last morsel of succulent meat from the crevices of the beast.
They're drinking tiny Manhattans, Cosmopolitans and martinis. The
mood is high-spirited, almost giddy, as cascades of laughter erupt
and ricochet off the wall. You can barely hear the waiter. It's a
good thing the menu is printed daily. If a waiter had to recite the
specials, he or she would need the lungs of a Broadway star to carry
over the din</TE>
<TE>   Allyson Thurber, former executive chef at Water Grill downtown,
returned from the East Coast to open the Lobster in 1999. She does an
able job of commanding the galley on this overcrowded ship. The
kitchen gets the food out, and fast. Most of the time the servers
deliver it to the right person. The tips must be enticing because the
staff works as a team at maximum efficiency.</TE>
<TE>   Lobster is the theme, but Thurber's contemporary American seafood
menu includes a wider variety of fish than you'd find on most lobster
house menus, though nothing near the selection she covered at Water
Grill. It's one of the peculiarities of Southern California seafood
restaurants that only a small proportion of what's on offer is truly
local. Certainly not the lobster, which is live and from Maine.
Salmon and halibut hail from Alaska, prawns from Louisiana,
soft-shell crabs from Maryland, and day boat scallops from the colder
waters of the Atlantic.</TE>
<TE>   The squid and the mussels, the latter local, are two of the best
starters. "Crispy lemon" calamari are just that, with a punchy
anchoiade, or anchovy-laced aioli, to set them off. I like the
combination of steamed mussels and clams in a broth scented with
lemon grass and ginger. One night, sauteed fresh Pacific sole is
delicious with its sidekicks of artichoke, lemon and capers.</TE>
<TE>   Ceviche lacks the jolt of fresh-squeezed lime laced with chile
(this is a very mild version), but the fried-to-order tortilla chips
are a nice touch. Lobster cocktail comes with a lemony aioli suffused
with tarragon. I keep wanting to dip everything in sight in it just
so I can taste it again. The lobster runs out quickly, though. Served
in a martini glass, the shellfish is propped up on shredded lettuce,
so it looks like more than it really is. Whether or not you like the
corn soup depends on whether you like it sugared. I don't. With the
corn season at its height, the fresh corn salad, which comes with
plump crab cakes, tastes like summer. Fried oysters that garnish an
ordinary romaine and endive salad would be better off on their own-or
piled into a po' boy sandwich.</TE>
<TE>   Lobster, curiously, is one of the least successful items on the
menu. It's not that tender, and at $25 a pound, I'd expect something
more vibrant. After a cocktail or two, and enough drawn butter, it
passes muster, barely. The pan-roasted 1 1/2-pounder is a better bet.
Set on redundant "lobster mashed potatoes," it's nicely cooked, and I
like the Jim Beam sauce, but not enough to want a soup bowl of it on
my plate. Garlic herb butter keeps the grilled lobster from drying
out and nicely disguises the fact that the crustacean doesn't have
much flavor.</TE>
<TE>   In season, soft-shell crabs are juicy and crisp, served with
coleslaw and corn on the cob and a handmade tartar sauce. During the
short Copper River salmon season, don't miss this distinctive wild
salmon. However Louisiana shrimp, cooked with the heads on, aren't
served well by "dirty" rice in a puddle of slightly thickened peppery
sauce.</TE>
<TE>   The waiters are slick, subtly looking to boost the bill, intent on
ferrying the food out quickly, refilling those glasses and turning
the tables. One waiter asks each of us in turn if we would like
coffee, espresso, cappuccino, Cognac, another drink-as if hearing the
whole litany one more time might trigger one or all of us into going
for a cappuccino, or even better, one of their liquor-laced coffee
drinks. I don't consider it friendly to try to press a third
Manhattan on one of my guests. What if he were driving? Before
handing us the bill, she tells us we've been really sweet, and, palms
together as if she's greeting a swami, gives us a little bow.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the restaurant's seafood theme, the wine list has nearly
as many reds as whites. Roses, which would be an excellent match with
much of the food, are limited to just two entries, neither available
by the glass, even though the wine-by-the-glass program encompasses
some two dozen selections. There's also a short, sweet selection of
half bottles, which includes Blockhedia Ringnosii's fine Sauvignon
Blanc, and Ridge's reliable "Geyserville" Zinfandel, as well as a
split of Laurent-Perrier brut Champagne.</TE>
<TE>   The Lobster's desserts are the sort of sugary, gooey confections a
10-year-old would find riveting. Blueberry cobbler, for example,
isn't a proper cobbler at all but a sweet stew of blueberries topped
with what seems like granola. Vanilla ice cream helps to cut its
cloying sweetness. A couple of items feature peanut butter, the most
fanciful of which is a sort of pie with a tall dark chocolate cookie
crust layered with peanut butter filling, a billowy cloud of
chocolate mousse and whipped cream. If you like Reese's peanut butter
cups, you'll like this. Otherwise, get the smooth-as-silk
butterscotch creme brulee. Sea air and seafood are a combination that
brings in an inexhaustible crowd. I just wish there were something
more personal, and less corporate, about both the staff's reception
and the food. Chef Thurber's take on contemporary American seafood is
a plus. Where it falls down is in the execution.</TE>

<DH>ACTRESS LAURA HARRING IS SEDUCED TO THE DARK SIDE OF FALL
FASHION</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HEATHER JOHN</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>If Laura Elena Harring does not believe she's a femme fatale, then
clearly she hasn't caught her act on screen. Or off. Or maybe it's
not an act at all.</LD>
<LD>   On a bright and breezy L.A. morning, Harring arrives at Frank
Lloyd Wright's 1924 Ennis-Brown house in the hills of Los Feliz
wearing a blousy red cotton dress she picked up at a bazaar in
Thailand, paired with sequined sandals. Her dark hair is disheveled.
She is likable, friendly, demure. Then Laura Elena Harring disappears
into wardrobe and emerges a blond-a blond in a traffic-stopping
Scarlett O'Hara-esque crinoline gown. She strikes a pose for the
camera. The metamorphosis is instant. Sultry, pouty, feline,
dangerous-and believable.</LD>
<LD>   For those who saw Harring last year in David Lynch's film
''Mulholland Drive,'' in which she played both a vulnerable and
confused amnesia victim and a calculating Hollywood actress, the
Mexico native is a natural in the femme-fatale genre. But Harring
appears vexed by the comparison. ''I see myself as more romantic and
vulnerable,'' she says. ''But I'm starting to realize that there
might be a femme fatale inside of me because so many people have told
me that, particularly after 'Mulholland Drive.'</LD>
<TE>   ''I just followed David's direction, which was to 'walk like a
kitty cat.' And that was my impression of a kitty cat. What everyone
else saw was old Hollywood glamour.''</TE>
<TE>   Off screen, Harring's life reads, well, like a movie. Born in Los
Mochis in northern Mexico (her grandfather was the country's leading
equestrian and fencer), Harring moved to San Antonio, Texas, at the
age of 10. As a teenager she convinced her parents to send her to the
elite Aiglon College in Switzerland, after which she traveled
throughout Asia with a brief stint as a social worker in India. Upon
returning to the States, Harring enrolled in several beauty pageants,
successively winning the titles of Miss El Paso, Miss Texas and, in
1985, Miss USA, making her the first Latina to hold the title. At the
age of 18, she met, married and shortly thereafter divorced the
German count Carl von Bismarck, yet still retains the title of
countess. She also dances a mean tango.</TE>
<TE>   ''The tango is my other passion,'' the actress says. The first is,
of course, clothes. ''I wish clothes didn't play such an important
role, but it's so much fun to play different characters.'' She
collects fabrics from Egypt, Israel and Sri Lanka, exotic Asian
jewelry and traditional Mexican dresses. ''I like to carry a little
bit of Mexico with me when I go out. I love wearing flowers in my
hair, like the ones you notice when you go to a beautiful Mexican
beach. And I love to wear the sunset colors-wine, pink, coral,
rust.'' And let's not forgot those $1-million Stuart Weitzman diamond
stilettos we saw her wearing at the Academy Awards. Simply put,
Harring likes to dazzle.</TE>
<TE>   She continues to pursue stylized roles (or they continue to pursue
her) that rely on her special blend of fragility and danger. Next up
is New Line's Hitchcockian thriller ''Willard,'' followed by director
Paul Hills' ''The Poet,'' which the actress is currently shooting in
Vienna. ''My character is at the same time vulnerable and very
strong.'' Which should come as a surprise to no one.</TE>

<HD>Making an Entrance</HD>
<DH>This season, the femme fatale leaves her mark on the runways.
From the slinky bias-cut gowns of Hollywood's golden era to the
spy-who-came-in-from-the-cold overcoats, the look is strong, sexy and
self-assured. In the pages that follow, we trace the trail of femme
fatale glamour and fall's most dazzling looks.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BOOTH MOORE</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Femme fatales really know how to make an entrance. think of joan</LD>
<LD>   Crawford in ''Mildred Pierce'' (1945) walking down the pier at
night, dressed in a fur coat and a deliciously ironic "halo hat'' to
match. Or Jane Greer in ''Out of the Past'' (1947), silhouetted by
the sunlight in a dress with a skirt straight enough to show off her
swagger. And how about Barbara Stanwyck's stairway entrance in
''Double Indemnity'' (1944), when the camera lingers teasingly on her
gold anklet and those fabulous pumps with the playful pompoms on the
toes?</LD>
<LD>   These women use their allure to subjugate men, often leading them
to ruin. Middle-class housewives, waitresses, receptionists, singers,
actresses, heiresses, even interns, they have one thing in common:
deriving power from their sexuality. Their props include sinuous
gowns, tight skirts, tantalizing jewels, lacy lingerie and hypnotic,
kohl-lined eyes. Clothing is integral to this noir archetype.</LD>
<TE>   This fall, the femme fatale has returned to the fashion pages,
thanks to the offerings of several top designers. Nipped at the waist
pencil skirts, bias-cut silk gowns that pour to the floor like
molasses, sumptuous fur stoles and pumps with heels as sharp as ice
picks may not seem warm and fuzzy, but they are fashion's version of
comfort food-visual cues for a nostalgic glamour that's as easily
communicated as it is understood.</TE>
<TE>   The myth of the femme fatale is sometimes described as man's
attempt to blame women for evil in the world-women are sirens, and
therefore men should be absolved of all responsibility for their
actions. But this season's aggressive screen-siren chic shouldn't be
read as revenge. Designers have recast the role of the femme fatale
in a flattering light. More than just a temptress, she is now
respectable-a strong woman who knows what she wants.</TE>
<TE>   ''There's something powerful in being a femme fatale,'' says Zac
Posen, a young up-and-coming New York designer. His fall collection
of sexy satin and crepe dresses with contrasting insets, fitted
bodices, fluttery hems and ev after Artemis, the Greek goddess of the
hunt, and inspired by the costumes of powerhouse actresses such as
Crawford, Marlene Dietrich, Norma Shearer and Rita Hayworth. On
screen, these women surpassed their human attributes to become almost
mythological creatures-and mythological creatures require clothing
that transforms and transports. Posen's sophisticated,
menswear-styled ''she-man'' jumpsuit, with a slit that's thigh-high
on one leg, Prada's high-waisted boucle pencil skirt and
1940s-inspired duchesse satin puff-sleeve top, and Gucci's slinky
gothic gowns with fishtail hems have the power to take the women who
wear them to another time.</TE>
<TE>   At Miu Miu, lavender double-knit short shorts, bubble-gum pink
halter-top playsuits and sequined pumps worthy of a cheesecake shot
evoke Lana Turner in the 1946 film ''The Postman Always Rings
Twice.'' Anyone who's partial to Prada can work her curves by
cinching a wide crocodile belt over a cardigan sweater and a flared
black-sequined skirt, or slipping into a pleated silk dress with thin
leather laces that accentuate the waist and hips. Louis Vuitton's
Marc Jacobs glams up straight herringbone skirts with crinkly lame
tops, silk camisoles or white rabbit-fur bomber jackets. And
Alexander McQueen's skinny brown tweed skirts seem almost villainous
when paired with brown leather braces bound around the waist and bust
and menacing boots laced high on the thigh. ''I wanted the girls to
look empowered in both a sexual and intellectual way,'' he says.</TE>
<TE>   This fall's femme fatale looks acknowledge a longing for escape.
''The way designers are reacting to the world is to create objects of
desire that allow people to transform themselves in a way that
obliterates the malaise,'' says Harold Koda, curator of the
Metropolitan Museum of Art's Costume Institute in New York.</TE>
<TE>   Tom Ford's fall collection for Gucci includes elaborately worked
stilettos with mother of pearl inlay heels, hefty crocodile doctor
bags with carved wood handles, and rich jacquard coats with obi belts
inspired by 19 that continue to remind us of terrorist threats and a
shaky economy, there's a sense that women need to be seduced into
spending, Ford says. ''People have been buying special items since
Sept. 11. They are buying clothing like they would have bought
accessories before.''</TE>
<TE>   the femme fatale first appeared thousands of years ago in
literature, was then incorporated into theater and, finally, into
film. Think Samson and Delilah. Or Helen of Troy (''Beauty, terrible
beauty!'' Homer wrote in the Iliad.) Cleopatra changed history by
persuading Julius Caesar to help her win a civil war against her
brother. After he was killed, she seduced his successor, Mark Antony;
their love affair ended in a double suicide. Abbe Prevost's famous
1731 character Manon Lescaut was a femme fatale, a mistress of amour
fou, as was the protagonist in Prosper Merimee's 1845 novella
''Carmen'' and Georges Bizet's opera of the same name.</TE>
<TE>   Along the way, there have been real-life femme fatales. Consider
the 17th century's Nell Gwyn, whose cleavage transformed her from a
saleswoman of oranges to mistress of Charles II. Or Madame de
Pompadour, a French courtesan who defied her roots to become the
mistress of Louis XV. Or Christine Keeler, Wallis Simpson, Judith
Campbell Exner and Monica Lewinsky.</TE>
<TE>   But it was at the movies that the femme fatale-and her
wardrobe-were seared into our consciousness.</TE>
<TE>   She first appeared on screen during the Silent Era, according to
Kevin Jones, museum collections manager at the Fashion Institute of
Design and Merchandising in L.A., when Theda Bara was credited as
playing the original film "vamp." Cast as a woman bent on wholesale
destruction in ''Sin'' (1915), ''Siren of Hell'' (1915), ''The
Vixen'' (1916) and other aptly titled films, her kohl eyeliner and
dangling earrings started fashion trends.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the discussion about movie femme fatales centers around
the great noir films of the 1930s and '40s. Escapist fare produced
during the Depression portrayed women using their feminine wiles to
work their way from rags ''Possessed'' (1931), Joan Crawford runs
away from her life as a worker in a cardboard box factory. She moves
to New York City, where she meets a hotshot lawyer (Clark Gable) who
puts her up in a Park Avenue apartment and dresses her in glorious
gowns, designed by costume great Adrian. By the end of the film, she
ends up ruining his political ambitions with her tarnished
reputation.</TE>
<TE>   The 1940s saw the release of such classic detective films as ''The
Maltese Falcon'' (1941), ''Laura'' (1944), ''Gilda'' (1946) and ''The
Big Sleep'' (1946). Actresses wore fabric-conserving pencil skirts
(it was wartime) and blouses or jackets that had angular, almost
architectural, shoulders-a trend started by Adrian to make Crawford's
shoulders broader than her hips. They carried envelope clutch purses
and wore high-heeled shoes with ankle-straps, not unlike the ones
designers are showing now. And for murderous, rain-soaked nights
there were always trenchcoats, though they were khaki, not the
peekaboo plastic that's coming from Prada this fall.</TE>
<TE>   The hard-boiled detective sagas and the women who populated them
gradually receded from the big screen in the 1960s. The classic
character then made a comeback in ''Basic Instinct'' (1992) and
''Bound'' (1996). In last year's ''Mulholland Drive,'' Laura Harring
embodied danger in sizzling red and black. In the meantime, anyone
who needs a dose of dangerous beauty can wander the aisles of stores
this fall.</TE>
<TE>   pop culture has overflowed with ''characters'' (the success of the
movie ''Spider-Man'' comes to mind), and the femme fatale is an
attractive icon for those who buy into the current notion that
fashion is about role-playing rather than trends. Tom Ford's
body-skimming gowns for Gucci could fit the role of evil seductress
with their dramatic plunging backs and sinister slits. (''It was a
merge of Jean Harlow, Clara Bow and Chrissie Hynde,'' the designer
says.) Newcomer Behnaz Sarafpour's deep amethyst-colored georgette
gowns, with straps that delicately criss-cross the chest, are draped
in innuendo. And Posen's 1930s-inspired creations, including a V-neck
gown with an attached wing collar and a red hooded raincoat dress,
evoke gumshoe mystery.</TE>
<TE>   Like the outlines of a comic strip character, the graphic quality
of femme fatale clothing is easy to understand. There's something
comforting about recalling a time when the narrative of life was
literal enough that you could tell at first glance the good guys from
the bad.&amp;gt;</TE>
<TE>   But now that the monolithic style handed down from designers is a
thing of the past, the femme fatale is just one of many personas a
woman can choose from in her closet. "I don't know many women who are
going to embrace the role every day,'' says Jones of the fashion
institute. "But now that women really are empowered, they can be
sweet and pleasant one day and a femme fatale the next. Then they can
go hiking.''</TE>

<DH>FREDERICK'S OF HOLLYWOOD RELISHED ITS SAUCY IMAGE. BUT AS
BANKRUPTCY THREATENED, IT WAS TIME TO RECOGNIZE THERE'S MORE TO LIFE
THAN MARABOU.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>In the lingerie industry, there's a little man behind the curtain who
pulls all the corset strings and his name is Frederick-of-Hollywood.
Fred Mellinger passed away in 1990, but the company he started in
1946 is still the think tank of the undergarment industry. Yes,
Victoria's Secret gets most of the attention, but if Frederick's CEO
Linda LoRe has her way, the company will soon grab some limelight of
its own, thanks to a re-branding campaign that has Frederick's
embracing its saucy heritage.</LD>
<LD>   Mellinger, who moved into the flagship store's current location on
Hollywood Boulevard in 1947, started out on the cutting edge. His
first product offering was black lingerie, something Americans had
never seen outside of a French postcard. Most of today's bra-wearers
(and the people who love them) probably don't know that Frederick's
also pioneered the padded bra and the push-up bra; sold the first
bikini in California (it was a leopard-print number); and introduced
the now-ubiquitous thong and the boy-leg panty to the American
public.</LD>
<TE>   But despite its persistent creativity, Frederick's has been
languishing for years-just like Hollywood. The city and its namesake
company seemed clueless about how to update their tacky image. Today,
when most Americans think of women's lingerie, the picture that most
likely comes to mind is of a Victoria's Secret supermodel striding
aggressively across the screen during a break in the Super Bowl.
Every season the retail giantess kills Frederick's with mega-selling
versions of its innovative products (being first doesn't count for
much in the fashion business, where good ideas circulate freely).
Now, as Hollywood attempts to pull itself up by the bootstraps,
Frederick's, the second-largest lingerie retailer in America, is
doing the same.</TE>
<TE>   How does a company announce its own retooling? with a party, of
course. This spring, the "new" Frederick's staged its first fall
fashion week runway show in the Star Shoes bar/boutique on Hollywood
Boulevard. The company previewed its fall line as well as its
carnally delightful models. The party was so crowded that the fire
marshal arrived to keep in check a horde that included a healthy
number of extremely fashion-forward, if not quite A-list,
celebrities. (If you can be a hit with both Melissa Rivers and the
Red Hot Chili Peppers' Anthony Kiedis, you're certainly onto
something.)</TE>
<TE>   The fashion show is just one in a series of surprises that started
three years ago when the Frederick's owners, Wilshire Partners, hired
a new CEO to shake the company awake. Linda LoRe is not a typical
corporate turnaround artist, judging by the unlikely story of her
rise from shopgirl to executive. As a young fragrance buyer at
Robinson's in the early '80s, LoRe saw an ad for a new perfume called
Giorgio from a small boutique named Giorgio Beverly Hills. (The
Giorgio name was starting to register on the public radar because it
was mentioned in Judith Krantz's fashion-industry potboiler,
"Scruples.") LoRe cold-called Giorgio and got through to the CEO,
Fred Hayman. The rest of LoRe's story reads, oddly, like a Judith
Krantz novel.</TE>
<TE>   Before she knew it, LoRe had single-handedly brokered a deal
between Robinson's and Giorgio that led to one of the biggest
fragrance launches in history at that time. Going to work for Giorgio
later, she worked her way up to CEO by repeating her success with
another record-breaking fragrance launch, this time for Giorgio Red.
LoRe spent 11 years at Giorgio, seven as CEO, before leaving in 1997
to develop a nonprofit entrepreneurial academy for disadvantaged
youth.</TE>
<TE>   In 1999, LoRe accepted the job of CEO of a decidedly disadvantaged
company; Frederick's was creaky, with outdated cash registers and a
confused corporate identity. Before she could put her marketing ideas
to work, she had to tackle a mountain of debt acquired during a 1987
stock repurchase and buyout that took the company from publicly held
to private. Forty-four million dollars is a lot of debt for a company
with estimated annual receipts between $200 million and $250 million.
The o! nly way LoRe had a shot at reinventing Frederick's was to seek
Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection.</TE>
<TE>   As for the business itself, the catalog and retail divisions
treated each other like competitors, and the 200-odd stores were not
generally located in the best malls (the company's X-rated reputation
was such that some high-end malls refused Frederick's entry). Even
the flagship Hollywood store was hopelessly outdated, having received
its most recent remodel in 1982, which is certainly not a moment any
fashionista would care to be stuck in. The merchandise was downright
bipolar, with a selection of racy-to-downright-sleazy stripper wear
on the one hand, and a line of overly utilitarian, no-nonsense
foundation wear on the other.</TE>
<TE>   "The logo is a good illustration of what was going on here," LoRe
says. "We had at least three separate logos in use-one for the
catalog, one for the stores and one for the Web site. The whole
company was like that."</TE>
<TE>   Under Chapter 11, LoRe closed more than 20 stores and began to
restructure the company, focusing on what was good and letting what
wasn't fall away. Only two executives had been with Frederick's for
more than three years. "I didn't have to go in and fire people. The
turnover was organic," she says. Today, most of the senior staff is
female, and the atmosphere in the office is fairly breathless with
anticipation. Frederick's is expected to emerge from Chapter 11
within the next few weeks, and LoRe is actively courting investors
for the company's big roll-out.</TE>
<TE>   The new product line is retro-chic and racy, with corsets, bras
and panties that look like something Nicole Kidman would have worn in
"Moulin Rouge," as well as more wearable items in satin, lace and
cotton that are, if anything, even sexier. "We're going back to our
heritage," LoRe says in her cinder-block-walled office above the
flagship store. "So we redesigned everything with the brand's history
in mind. The new logo, for instance, still has the traditional star
dotting the 'i.' "</TE>
<TE>   The logo was easy. Getting the corporate culture to gel was what
took the longest. LoRe studied companies such as Coca-Cola and Chanel
to get an idea of how a company with a strong brand can capitalize on
the past while looking toward the future. She also looked at other
companies that had successfully spruced up their image. "If you look
at a company like Target, its successful re-branding effort didn't
happen overnight," LoRe says. "They were working on that for years.
But you can believe that every single person who works for that
company knows exactly what the brand's image is supposed to be. And
now look at them." A lot more of the work involved talking to
customers. The marketing team conducted many focus groups. And as
part of their regular routine, the entire executive staff now spends
time selling lingerie in the stores, as well as quizzing customers on
what they like and don't like about proposed product lines.</TE>
<TE>   LoRe whips out a series of old catalog covers to illustrate the
changes she's implemented. "See this one," she says, holding up a
cover of a busty model bending over in a leopard-print swimsuit. "The
model is objectified here, it's insulting. And this one-" Here the
model is wearing a coat. "It looks like a JCPenney catalog. That one
turned off our true customers." Finally, she flips to a current
cover, where a fresh-faced wench in a push-up bra is smiling sweetly
through wind-swept hair. "See here, this is the new Frederick's:
sexy, approachable, fun."</TE>
<TE>   This identity is being test-marketed at the remodeled boutique in
the Glendale Galleria, one of the first Frederick's stores to get a
face-lift. The shop has been given an upscale boudoir feel, with red
velvet draperies, gold walls, leopard-print carpeting and the new
streamlined logo embossed in rich wood panels. The tone is decidedly
voluptuous and womanly, not campy. "Victoria's Secret is pink," LoRe
explains during a tour, "and we're red." Indeed.</TE>
<TE>   Look closely and you'll see that the elegant shop still sells
crotchless panties, nipple-baring bras and marabou-trimmed baby doll
nighties-things you don't get anywhere else in a typical shopping
mall. LoRe is deliberately positioning the company to offer
"alternative" lingerie, relative to Victoria's Secret's more
mainstream offerings. She even gives the big V a grateful nod for
blasting the lingerie market wide open.Retail analyst Jeff
Klinefelter of U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray, who tracks Victoria's
Secret's parent company, Limited Brands, for investors, thinks she's
wise to do so. He also thinks LoRe's strategy and timing are on
target. "All Victoria's Secret did was demonstrate that you could
have a specialty retailer in this segment," he says. "The newcomers
who have failed, like Cacique, didn't have a strong brand, and that's
one thing Frederick's has going for them: They've got incredible
brand equity. As for there being room in the market, look at
Abercrombie &amp; Fitch or American Eagle. Even though the Gap was out
there, look how well these specialty retailers have done.</TE>
<TE>   Admittedly, LoRe and her staff still have a long way to go before
they can consider themselves an undergarment superpower. After all,
the first ad campaign for Frederick's has been plastered on city
buses, not TV screens. But the next time the company's industrial
engineers (just who did you think built bras?) come up with some
fabulous new gravity-defying innovation, you might find yourself
walking into a company store and buying it. And one thing's for
certain: It'll be red.</TE>

<HD>Ah, Sweet Nature ... but Only If You Can Afford a Piece of
It</HD>
<DH>Please save some for us, Mr. President.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN BALZAR</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Sometimes nature casts a spell on you. Acquaintances talk about
mystical connections to the Rocky Mountains, Michigan's Upper
Peninsula, the Gulf Stream off the Florida Keys, a hundred places.
These people grew up in Chicago, New Jersey, Los Angeles, and they
happened somewhere and ... well, you know their story. Lights went
on. Some life-sustaining Truth was revealed.</LD>
<LD>   These people talk about the vistas, the sense of space or the
climate; the smell of pinon smoke, the sunsets, or the whales
breaching the surface of the water. Their eyes soften. They say
things like: "I'm able to clear my mind, and it helps me put it all
into perspective. Problems don't go away when we're here, but you can
see them in a different light."</LD>
<LD>   Such a man is George W. Bush. You can see it in the images of him
at his ranch: the president cast in silhouette against the pale Texas
sky, or the president wandering, wide-eyed and happy, up a limestone
canyon. You can hear it in his words. The quote above is his.</LD>
<TE>   It is the nature of nature to inspire us. It's our ancestral home,
after all. Our DNA was coded by the rhythms of the natural world long
before the advent of cars, air-conditioned office buildings and the
40-hour workweek. In fact, there is plenty of good evidence that the
pace and accouterments of modern life are the root cause for so many
people feeling adrift nowadays: We have, in fact, departed our
element.</TE>
<TE>   The human desire, the need, to reengage nature periodically is one
of the essential arguments for conservation in this crowded epoch.
The stillness, the solitude, the escape, the renewal that one finds
in the natural world is our best, and perhaps final, source of
balance.</TE>
<TE>   I've heard cynics describe Bush's sun-scorched ranch as something
of a faux cowboy prop that he uses to maintain down-to-earth distance
from his old-money East Coast heritage. The truth, I think, is the
opposite. These 1,600 acres are not a retreat from elitism, but
rather an open-arms embrace of the most uncharitable kind of elitism:
the belief that nature belongs to those who can afford it. That
nature is a privilege for the privileged. That nature is another
free-market commodity for high bidders.</TE>
<TE>   Thus, while the president replenishes himself on his private
holdings and the vice president does the same on his spread in
Wyoming, their administration simultaneously has stepped up the war
against conservation of our public lands and waters. I'm referring to
the diminishing tracts of nature that we hold in collective trust,
but which the administration does not recognize for having the same
vital magic as those private ranches bought with the proceeds of
corporate payouts and dealings.</TE>
<TE>   In Colorado last week, the administration gave the go-ahead for
expanded oil exploration at another national monument, the Canyons of
the Ancients. "The people have a right to develop those areas," the
monument's manager said. By this, she meant "the people" in the oil
business. As for us other people and our yearnings for quiet, for
solitude, for the perspective that nature grants us? Want some, go
buy it. Or perhaps the converse: If you can't afford it, you don't
deserve it.</TE>
<TE>   Even more breathtaking, the Justice Department this month asserted
that the nation's foremost environmental law does not apply to our
coastal oceans. In 1969, President Richard M. Nixon signed the
National Environmental Policy Act, which requires the federal
government to take into account the environmental consequences of its
actions. "This is the Magna Carta of environmental law," says Joel
Reynolds of the Natural Resources Defense Council.</TE>
<TE>   But the Justice Department filed a court brief insisting that U.S.
territorial waters, those extending from 12 to 200 miles offshore,
were exempt from environmental review. At the moment, the issue is
the Navy's pursuit of a sonar system that is so explosively loud that
it may end the glorious comeback of whales. Tomorrow, perhaps the
issue will be sea-floor mining or waste dumping. Who knows the
consequences? The administration says it's not required to look.</TE>
<TE>   For millions of Americans, our ocean waters, our national
monuments, our public forests and grasslands and wilderness parks
provide our indispensable connections to nature, just as those
private ranches serve Bush, Cheney and other monied elites, or for
that matter non-elites who actually work the land.</TE>
<TE>   Recently, the president greeted a sunrise over his wilderness of
oaks and cedar elms. He spread his arms and intoned, "Thanks to the
good Lord." On a private ranch, that will suffice. The rest of us
sorely need more down-to-earth stewardship. Instead of widespread
development and step-by-step retreats on environmental protections,
our holdings deserve the respect our chief executive gives his own,
and for the very same reasons.</TE>

<BD>William J. Bennett is co-director of Empower America.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In his inaugural address, President Bush challenged Americans to
become "citizens, not spectators." Several months later, in the wake
of Sept. 11, he called upon all Americans to take an active role in
serving their neighbors and their nation.</LD>
<LD>   Specifically, he asked us to contribute two years over the course
of our lives to community service, whether it is building homes for
the poor, tutoring schoolchildren in reading and math, patrolling
urban neighborhoods or volunteering at the local firehouse.</LD>
<LD>   One of the vehicles the president has created for harnessing our
renewed patriotism is the USA Freedom Corps, a White House council
that would coordinate volunteerism, civics and service in an attempt
to build a culture of "citizenship, service and responsibility."</LD>
<TE>   Some conservatives argue that the president's plan, which includes
expanding the national service programs AmeriCorps and Senior Corps,
threatens to corrode and distort the work of private charities and
open yet another avenue to pork-barrel spending and government
bureaucracy.</TE>
<TE>   These fears were quite understandable during the frenetic years of
the previous administration. I myself was critical of AmeriCorps, for
it often seemed undisciplined--both in its management and the design
of its programs. But the agency that runs it, the Corporation for
National and Community Service, has done much to put the program's
financial and management house in order.</TE>
<TE>   And the changes to the agency that are incorporated in the
proposed Citizen Service Act--which would reauthorize the
corporation's three main programs, AmeriCorps, Senior Corps and Learn
and Serve America--promise to transform the agency into one that uses
government resources effectively to build up the strength of the
civic sector and to ensure that citizens, rather than government,
take responsibility for the health and well-being of their
communities.</TE>
<TE>   Expanding a government program to promote voluntary action does,
of course, seem counterintuitive. But since our nation's beginnings,
the relationship between the state and civil society often has been
positive and mutually supportive. Government has often acted as a
catalyst for civic association; it can act as such again. In fact,
the changes to the corporation envisioned by Bush are designed to do
just that.</TE>
<TE>   For instance, the Citizen Service Act would make the recruitment
and management of more volunteers for charities an explicit goal of
national service programs. It would also amend the law to allow
AmeriCorps members and Senior Corps volunteers to build the
administrative, technological and financial capacities of nonprofits,
rather than simply to provide beneficial services to individuals.</TE>
<TE>   This sort of activity strengthens the "armies of compassion," not
by making nonprofits into government's servants but by helping them
do more of the good they already do. Likewise, capacity-building
efforts with voluntary groups involved in public safety, public
health and disaster relief would improve their ability to work
together and with government law enforcement and rescue agencies when
terrorists (or other catastrophes) strike again.</TE>
<TE>   The Citizen Service Act's reforms represent a major change in the
way national service programs are administered, making them more
efficient and responsive to local needs. The act is not a cure-all,
nor does it pretend to be; good stewardship of the program will
always be important, and regular oversight must keep the earlier
problems from recurring.</TE>
<TE>   But passing the Citizen Service Act is clearly a step in the right
direction, and Congress should take that step when it returns in
September.</TE>

<HD>Make No Mistake: Seeking Perfection Harms Innovation</HD>
<DH>Scandals' worst effect may be to quash risk-taking.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD FARSON and RALPH KEYES</AU>
<BD>Richard Farson is president of the Western Behavioral
Sciences Institute in La Jolla; Ralph Keyes is a fellow of the
institute. They are co-authors of "Whoever Makes the Most Mistakes
Wins: The Paradox of Innovation" (Free Press/Simon and Schuster,
2002).</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>At the moment, investors and politicians are trying to put out the
firestorm of corporate crimes that came to light after the Enron
collapse.</LD>
<LD>   They are insisting not only on intensive investigations and
accounting reforms but punishment of the wrongdoers. In response, the
business community has become nervous and fearful. This may turn out
to be more damaging than the scandalous behavior itself.</LD>
<LD>   Caution and accountability are replacing the expansiveness that
once characterized American business. In the long run, this could be
the most destructive consequence of book-cooking by the likes of
Enron and WorldCom.</LD>
<TE>   Long before news of corporate scandals broke, Americans were
already on an accountability binge. Especially in our schools, but
also in other institutions, we have been demanding tests and
standards and answerability. The stunning misbehavior of the darlings
of our investing public has only intensified that attitude.</TE>
<TE>   As Ambrose Bierce noted almost a century ago, accountability is
"the mother of caution." In a climate of fear, we tend to insist more
and more on tests and measures. In the process we become increasingly
risk-averse.</TE>
<TE>   Taking risks, however, is precisely what is needed now, more than
ever.</TE>
<TE>   Risk is the only avenue to innovation. And the demand for
innovation in the current fast-paced, globalized and technologized
economy is constant. We need continual innovation in both product and
process.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, we are seeing a pulling back, a move toward tightening
up, toward making sure no mistakes are made.</TE>
<TE>   Today's most popular management fad is a quality-control approach
known as "six sigma," a term borrowed from statistics that means that
the work done by our business and government institutions must be as
close to perfect as possible. No mistakes.</TE>
<TE>   This impulse to seek perfection takes us in the wrong direction,
robbing us of what is perhaps our most important national strength:
the ability to innovate. Other countries may occasionally have taken
markets away from us, but there were always more where those markets
came from because we had the power to innovate by taking chances and,
in the process, to create new markets.</TE>
<TE>   Mistakes and failure are the inevitable consequences of taking
risks. One measure of genuine risk-taking is the amount of failure
generated. That's why IBM's Thomas Watson Sr. said, "If you want to
increase the probability of success, double your failure rate."</TE>
<TE>   The great innovators from Thomas Edison down to the contemporary
entrepreneurs in Silicon Valley have operated on the same principle.
They understand that failure and success are intimately connected,
interdependent, sometimes indistinguishable. One has always led to
the other.</TE>
<TE>   Microsoft's Bill Gates was recently depicted in Fortune magazine
as a risk-taker whose success grew from the realization that, in the
words of a colleague, "you have to try everything, because the real
secret of innovation is to fail fast."</TE>
<TE>   To allow the current revelations of disgraceful corporate behavior
to make us hunker down in a mode of caution could cause us to lose
our edge in the highly competitive global economy.</TE>

<HD>A Crazy Quilt of Victim Compensation</HD>
<DH>Think through efforts to aid those hurt by terrorists.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD M. MOSK</AU>
<BD>Richard M. Mosk is an associate justice of the
California Court of Appeal and, formerly, a judge of the Iran-U.S.
Claims Tribunal, established as a part of the 1981 Iran-U.S. hostage
agreement.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Congress several years ago agreed to pay hundreds of millions of
dollars to a small group of Americans who were injured or killed at
the hands of foreign terrorists. The payments were the product of
this perverted logic: that compensating the victims would punish the
terrorists--even if American taxpayers made the payments.</LD>
<LD>   Now Congress is at it again, proposing to provide a few
politically well-connected victims of terrorism--none of whom are
related to the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks--with millions of dollars
in the name of fighting terrorism. It is time to stop this practice
before it gets even more out of hand.</LD>
<LD>   The precedent of paying victims of terrorism was set when the
family of Alisa Flatow, a 20-year-old American student killed in 1995
by a terrorist bomb in Israel, sued Iran in an American court.</LD>
<TE>   The legal theory of the Flatow case was that Iran, as a financial
sponsor of the culpable terrorist group, was legally responsible for
her death. This same theory was used later by others, such as
journalist Terry Anderson, who had been taken hostage by another
terrorist group.</TE>
<TE>   Normally, by law in almost all countries, governments cannot be
sued for anything except for their business-related dealings. But
Congress in 1996 passed a law to carve out an exception for
designated terrorist states so that Flatow and similar victims could
go ahead with their lawsuits. Because Iran refused to respond to the
Flatows' suit, her family won a $247-million default judgment against
Iran. A few other victims of such terrorist acts also filed similar
suits and also obtained large judgments against Iran.</TE>
<TE>   Iran was not about to pay, of course, and the plaintiffs also
could not collect the judgments by seizing Iranian assets in the U.S.
Although Congress in 1998 passed legislation allowing for such
seizures, President Clinton, "in the interest of national security,"
prevented it in the Flatow case. For one thing, seizing foreign
assets would have made American assets abroad vulnerable to similar
seizures. Also, some feared that the U.S. might be held responsible
anywhere for the acts of any group to which it had given covert aid.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, the United States wanted to preserve the option of
freezing foreign assets to use them as bargaining chips, as it had
done to good effect two decades ago in the Iran hostage crisis.</TE>
<TE>   To avoid the problems that the proposed legislation would create,
Congress and the administration opted to have the American taxpayers
make good on a few specified plaintiffs' multimillion-dollar
judgments, including the Flatows'. The United States paid more than
$300 million to just five plaintiffs with existing judgments against
Iran. Although Congress ordered the American government to try to
recoup this money, there was not a realistic chance of that.</TE>
<TE>   Not surprisingly, other victims of foreign and domestic terrorism
have since asked: Why not us? More claims have followed, some of them
tied to Sept. 11 compensation programs, even though the claimants
were not victims of the crimes that day. Among those who could
benefit are hostages held in Iran from 1979 to 1981; the victims of
bombings of the Oklahoma City federal building in 1995, the American
embassies in Africa in 1998 and the World Trade Center in 1993; and
the victims of last year's anthrax attacks. This expensive, unfair
and irrational system of compensation must be reined in.</TE>
<TE>   One way to do that is to defeat legislation that is waiting in a
conference committee, having passed the House and Senate, that would
allow specified claimants to recover compensation from the U.S. and
would allow those who had judgments against such states as Iran to
seize assets--even universally protected embassy and consular
properties (and remember our reaction when Iran seized our embassy)
to be used to pay judgments.</TE>
<TE>   This legislation would have disastrous consequences. It would
subject the United States to retaliation and financial exposure,
impair the president's ability to enter into agreements and treaties
and leave important foreign policy matters in the hands of tort
plaintiffs and their lawyers, rather than with the government, where
they belong.</TE>
<TE>   Because we have established a plan to compensate the Sept. 11
terrorist victims, an argument can be made that the U.S. government
should compensate all civilian victims of foreign terrorists who are
targeted because they are Americans. But these compensation schemes
should be fair and rational and divorced from a judicial tort system
that results in staggering awards from the U.S. Treasury to just a
few victims and their lawyers and that threatens to interfere with
our foreign policy.</TE>

<HD>Deaf to Health Fund Crisis</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Faced with a $24-billion state deficit, a budget stalemate and a
reelection campaign, it's easy to understand why Gov. Gray Davis
doesn't want to hear about Los Angeles County's $800-million
health-care deficit right now. Understandable, however, isn't the
same as excusable. This is a crisis that affects a third of
California's population.</LD>
<LD>   The governor's hands-off approach is particularly galling now that
state officials have started second-guessing the county's own efforts
to deal with the deficit. State health officials screamed when L.A.
County supervisors recently voted to close 11 clinics and end
inpatient services at an Antelope Valley hospital.</LD>
<LD>   The cuts are alarming. But if the governor was so concerned about
health care for the poor, surely he wouldn't be trying to balance his
own budget by slashing state matching funds for Medi-Cal to the
lowest in the nation, in turn reducing the amount the federal
government pitches in. Surely he wouldn't be reinstating cumbersome
paperwork that discourages the poor from using cost-effective
services, or postponing innovations that would have expanded
insurance coverage.</LD>
<TE>   No, we suspect that what caught the determinedly deaf Davis' ear
were complaints from organized labor, a key constituent, about lost
jobs. No one wants to see jobs--and their accompanying medical
benefits--lost. But the recently announced cuts shave just $150
million from the looming deficit, which will reach almost $1 billion
in three years as a federal subsidy is phased out. Supervisors warn
of even more dire cuts and job losses to come unless the county gets
some help.</TE>
<TE>   Here's the catch: Unlike the Clinton administration, which was
willing to negotiate directly with Los Angeles County supervisors,
the Bush administration says it wants to work with the state and its
largest county together. But the state is refusing to even forward
the supervisors' new bailout proposal unless they undo their recent
cuts--cuts that would cost jobs for Davis' supporters.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, conditions in the county are building toward the
health-care equivalent of a perfect storm. The region's vast number
of immigrants, both legal and illegal, and the profusion of jobs that
offer no medical insurance combine to leave more than 2 million
people without any health insurance. County government cannot by
itself keep up with the costs of caring for this ever-increasing
population. Closing county hospitals and clinics would overwhelm
private hospitals and undermine the already fragile trauma-care
system. Everyone in the county, rich or poor, with or without
insurance, would suffer the effects.</TE>
<TE>   Figuring out how to pay ever-rising medical costs for an
ever-growing uninsured population is a difficult, complex
undertaking. It's understandable that politicians across the country
spend more time trying to avoid the problem than solve it. But it's
not excusable. California can do far better than point out the
problems in Los Angeles County. It can join in finding ways to fix
them.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Trust is a little word and a big concept that's taken a genuine
pounding across America in recent months. We trusted that evil was
far away, airlines were strong and airliners were safe. We trusted
that skyscrapers didn't collapse, quarterly corporate reports were
true, the stock market and economy were recovering and even hate had
limits. We trusted that baseball was a game, Olympic judges and
Little League coaches didn't cheat and adults--even strangers and
especially priests--wouldn't hurt children.</LD>
<LD>   Given such apparently contrary evidence, perhaps it should not be
too surprising that we so easily find reasons to ponder distrust
these days. It's amazing how important something as transparent as
trust can be in our lives. And how frazzled most feel when any trust
is betrayed, even the simple trust in a once-reliable car to start.
Distrust throws everything into doubt. Even suspicion of betrayal
corrodes the bonds that link family, town and nation.</LD>
<TE>   Trust, according to Webster, is a "firm belief or confidence in
the honesty, integrity, reliability, justice, etc. of another person
or thing." As invisible as it is, trust, it turns out, is an
essential ingredient in a successful society, especially a democracy.
We trust in trust in so many ways each day. Trust that our elected
representatives will be honest and representative, if not infallible.
Trust that our justice system will be, if not perfect, at least fair.
Employers trust employees to work. Employees trust employers to pay.
Customers trust the products they buy and sellers trust their payment
promises. Trust is even printed on our money.</TE>
<TE>   It takes a long while to build trust and only seconds for it to
melt away. But before we get too suspicious of trusting people and
things, as terrorists hope we will, let's recall some important
facts. We trust that firemen and police will do heroic things in a
crisis--and they did. We trust neighbors and volunteers to help each
other--and they have. We trust our governments to run and our way of
life to survive--and they have. A recent CNN/USA Today poll found
that more people trust others today (41%) than two years ago (38%).
Teachers were the most-trusted segment (84%) and HMO managers the
least (20%).</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps it's presumptuous of journalists, trusted by 38%, to
suggest this, but trust has been a historical hallmark for Americans.
Who has trusted more and longer in the collective wisdom of a free,
majority vote and trusted so many million strangers to join them?
We've sometimes paid a price for misplaced trust, but we've always
returned to trust as a behavioral girder. We will again. We trust.</TE>

<HD>A Mugabe-Made Famine</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The idea of a man-made famine that kills millions of innocents as a
tool of government policy seems almost too horrible to believe. But
it happened in Stalin's Russia and Mao's China--and it may be on the
verge of happening in Zimbabwe. The dictatorial President Robert
Mugabe is championing a violent fast-track land resettlement scheme
that would demolish agricultural production in a drought-stricken
country the United Nations World Food Program estimates already has 6
million people at risk of starvation.</LD>
<LD>   No one disputes the need for land reform in the former Rhodesia, a
British colony that obtained independence in 1980. Whites, who make
up less than 1% of the population of 13 million, control up to 70% of
arable land. But instead of creating a rational process that would
include some compensation for taking land, Mugabe chose to unleash
lawless militias that are better acquainted with rifles than
pitchforks.</LD>
<LD>   It began in 2000 when his government approved laws that permitted
black residents to seize land owned by whites. In the last two years,
government-supported militias have assaulted not only white farm
owners but also black farm workers and other rural Zimbabweans. Most
of those at risk are not the descendants of white interlopers but
Mugabe's own black brethren. The attacks on whites serve as a
smokescreen for his general war against freedom for his people.</LD>
<TE>   Now that his Aug. 8 midnight deadline has passed for 2,900 white
farmers to abandon their farms, Mugabe is depicting his eviction
program as part of a war against colonialism. Many of the farmers are
resisting vacating their land, and the Zimbabwean High Court recently
ruled that the government cannot seize property without informing
banks that hold the mortgages. But Mugabe, who is widely suspected of
having rigged March elections, is not backing down. If full-scale
eviction takes place, his goons will probably displace hundreds of
thousands of black workers. The results for crop production would be
catastrophic.</TE>
<TE>   The European Union has properly acted to distribute emergency food
aid. Both the EU and the United States have banned members of
Mugabe's party from travel and frozen their assets. Following the
dubious March elections, South Africa, Australia and Nigeria moved to
suspend Zimbabwe's membership in the Commonwealth.</TE>
<TE>   The key to reining in Mugabe may lie in South Africa because
Zimbabwe is dependent on that nation's advanced banking and electric
system. If Mugabe is immune to moral appeals, economic power might
pull him back from the brink before millions of Zimbabweans starve to
death.</TE>

<LD>Shouldn't we fix our accounting rules and standards so everyone from
Wall Street analysts to the guys on the street can have confidence in
our public corporations ("Corporate Lawyers Serve the Investors, SEC
Chief Insists," Aug. 13)?</LD>
<LD>   It does no good to force America's corporate heads to certify the
accuracy of their accounting documents if today's accounting rules
allow fuzzy math, confusion and obfuscation to creep into those
reports.</LD>
<LD>   It also does no good to say you will arrest a corporate head who
cheats if that person's lawyer can prove in a court of law that the
current--albeit confusing--accounting standards were followed. That
does not fix the core problem, wastes prosecutor time and only
promotes political grandstanding. Bold new leadership in government
and the accounting industry is needed. An emphasis on ethics in our
business schools wouldn't hurt either.</LD>

<LD>Although I understand there is a lot of history with our relationship
with Iran, we should be looking forward rather than backward in that
relationship ("In Afghanistan, Iranian Chides U.S.," Aug. 14). It
looks to me that of all the Islamic countries in the world, Iran is
one of the few that espouses any sense of democratic principles. I
remember the hostage crisis of 23 years ago. I know the Iranians
oppose U.S. support for Israel and that they remember our support of
the shah before their revolution. I really believe we need to focus
on our common interests rather than our differences.</LD>

<HD>A History Lesson for Valley Secessionists</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>For months I have been following the Valley secession movement with
growing agitation, and "Valley Secessionists Weary of L.A.'s Snubs
and Snobs" (Aug. 13) has finally moved me to write. The reason the
Valley has no major cultural facilities is because 25 years ago the
Valley, led by the very same people leading the secession movement
today, spurned the opportunity to build a first-rate cultural center
in the Sepulveda Basin. The Valley Cultural Center had secured from
the Army Corps of Engineers a large site at the intersection of
Victory and Balboa boulevards. Architectural designs and models were
prepared, local elected officials were supportive and funding was in
place.</LD>
<LD>   But Valley homeowner leaders vehemently opposed the project,
claiming that it was "growth-inducing." This is the same argument
that has been used over the years to oppose recreational facilities
in the basin, rail transit and numerous other improvements and
facilities proposed for the Valley. The bottom line is that the
Valley we have today is the Valley that homeowner leaders and
secessionists have spent the last 25 years creating. Contrary to
popular myth, the city has not ignored the Valley but has listened
too closely, cowering in the face of angry Valley homeowner groups
and going elsewhere with new projects.</LD>
<TE>   I am a lifetime resident of the Valley and love it here. It is
pitiful that anyone would feel inferior because they live in this
wonderful part of the city. I am reminded of Eleanor Roosevelt's
comment that nobody can make you feel inferior but yourself.
Secessionists would be wise to ponder this and assume responsibility
for their own state of real and/or imagined inadequacy.</TE>

<TE>   When I moved to Studio City for a brief time, I couldn't believe I
was still in Los Angeles! The city park down at the corner had
beautiful grass, a clean and updated play yard and even flowering
perennials; no park in L.A., where I was born and raised, ever looked
like that! No wonder L.A. city parks look so horrible--all the city's
best gardeners are working in the Valley. Maybe if the Valley seceded
we would have better service in the city's parks and sports programs.
I certainly won't miss all the best stuff for children going to the
Valley first.</TE>

<TE>   Recently I wondered why a perfectly good and fairly new road
currently undergoes extensive new resurfacing. At first I thought the
reason was that this particular road in Chatsworth borders a
multimillion-dollar gated community. However, the picture became very
clear. I received a written notification from the city informing me
that the street I live on in Chatsworth, a quiet cul de sac, would
soon be resurfaced.</TE>
<TE>   Huh? There is nothing wrong with the surface of my street! There
is hardly any traffic and there is no reason to spend tax money on
unnecessary and costly projects. I now realize that this is all a
silly attempt from the powers in charge to give us the impression
that the people over the hill, our loving and caring neighbors, are
actually taking care of us. And of course now we all will vote
against Valley secession.</TE>

<LD>Re "Camps for Citizens: Ashcroft's Hellish Vision," Commentary, Aug.
14: The column by Jonathan Turley sends chills up and down my spine.
If I understand this correctly, any U.S. citizen whom Atty. Gen. John
Ashcroft deems to be an enemy combatant or enemy of the state could
be sent to one of his proposed camps for detention. These
"combatants" or "enemies" would be held without recourse to legal
counsel. This is precisely the way Adolf Hitler started.</LD>
<LD>   Meanwhile, Ashcroft has done nothing meaningful to stop the flow
of illegal aliens streaming into our country, primarily because of
our president's fear of alienating Mexico and Canada. There are
undoubtedly many more potential terrorists in the illegal alien
category than in the U.S. citizen category. Ashcroft is one dangerous
dude.</LD>

<TE>   Los Angeles</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The attorney general has been hard at work dismantling the Bill of
Rights, and now he appears ready to shred the Constitution
altogether. Many of us knew the Senate was making a serious mistake
when senators confirmed Ashcroft. It's time for them to abide by
their oath to defend the Constitution and correct their error.</TE>
<TE>   Robert Anderson</TE>
<TE>   Studio City</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Commentators like Turley who trumpet "constitutional rights" when
a particular issue suits them are disingenuous. I haven't read any
discussion by Turley about the violation of our Constitution, our
sovereignty and our security by invading foreign nationals from
everywhere. Article IV Section 4 of the U.S. Constitution obligates
the federal government to protect the states against invasion.</TE>
<TE>   Be not troubled by the word "invasion." At the founding of our
nation, foreign armies, pirates and other uncontrolled aliens who
attempted to inhabit without license any colony, plantation or
jurisdiction were designated as invaders. Royal charters clearly
rejected inhabitants of New Spain, New France and Russian America,
and did not include them or their children as citizens. Present
invaders--foreign nationals who attempt to inhabit without
license--are a "constitutional menace"--Turley's words. Though I am
not destined for Ashcroft's hellish vision, I want my constitutional
rights and protections. Our elected representatives should support
and abide by the Constitution--all of it--as they pledged in their
oath of office.</TE>

<LD>Re "Ed Headrick; Inventor of Pro Model Frisbee," obituary, Aug. 14: I
think I can pinpoint when and where "Mrs. Frisbie's" pie tins were
first thrown. I was a student at Yale Law School from 1939 to 1942.
We often took her empty pie tins to the law library. For exercise
breaks, we would toss the pie tins in the small quadrangle of the law
school. There was too little space and too many expensive windows for
throwing baseballs. Three of us planned to add rubber extrusions to
the ring of the tins to add stability. We even checked the cost of
the extrusions but, alas, World War II interrupted our plans.</LD>

<LD>I agree with almost everything in George Skelton's column about the
proposed tax on cigarettes (Aug. 15). It is a hypocritical money grab
by Democrats who are targeting a behavior that many don't like and
even those who do have a hard time defending. If the tax has the
claimed desired effect of curbing smoking, it will cease to be a
viable revenue source. What politically incorrect behavior will be
the next target of Sacramento's insatiable appetite for tax dollars?
Alcohol is the next obvious target, but when that dries up what
perceived vice of yours will be next?</LD>
<LD>   Where I part from Skelton is in his attempt to paint poor people,
particularly Latinos and blacks, as the unintended disproportionately
affected victims of the tax. Smoking is an option. For someone
earning $20,000 a year it's a luxury. Skeleton's description of poor
Latinos in old shoes buying lottery tickets and cigarettes speaks
more to their poor decision-making and lack of personal
responsibility than to any unfairness on the part of legislators.</LD>

<LD>Re "Mediator Rules Against MTA on Bus Crowding," Aug. 8: The Bus
Riders Union's demand of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority
that it comply with the consent decree on relieving bus overcrowding
by spending more and more on buses is not the best solution for our
transit problems in L.A. County. While we certainly could use
additional buses, we also need dedicated transit ways, such as
light-rail lines, busways and subway extensions to meet the needs of
our growing population. Simply adding more buses into heavy traffic
will only worsen our growing street congestion.</LD>
<LD>   Providing transit users and all commuters a variety of options is
essential if we are to have a decent urban transit system. Hopefully,
Donald Bliss [the Washington lawyer appointed to mediate the dispute]
will have an open mind and consider some other solutions to resolve
overcrowding on some of the bus lines rather than just ordering the
MTA to purchase hundreds of buses.</LD>

Chilean Anti-Memoir" is now in paperback.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>After President Bush took office last year, the first world leader he
welcomed to the White House was his Mexican counterpart, Vicente Fox.
Vowing that affairs south of the border would now be America's first
priority, and suggesting that the Clinton administration had ignored
the region, the Bush White House promised an era of unprecedented
goodwill and cooperation toward Latin America.</LD>
<LD>   Then came Sept. 11. And in its wake, as the administration's focus
turned eastward and inward, no one in Washington seemed to notice--or
very much care anymore--that Latin America was dizzily dancing with
catastrophe, courting an unprecedented economic and political crisis.
So profound is that crisis that if the continental trend line
continues, the greatest foreign policy debacle of this administration
will take place right next door.</LD>
<LD>   In a move laden with symbolism, Fox has canceled a meeting with
Bush that had been scheduled for next week, protesting the Texas
execution of a convicted killer who held Mexican nationality. The
White House insists this small flap in no way interferes with "an
excellent professional relationship and a strong friendship" between
the two presidents. But the timing of Fox's cancellation seems to
crystallize the mounting frustration of an entire continent over its
relationship with the United States.</LD>
<TE>   Twenty years of American economic and political prescriptions for
the region can now be safely deemed a resounding failure. The
so-called Washington Consensus of privatized market economies, free
trade and democracy has collapsed with infinitely more noise and
drama than even our own corporate domestic debacles, a la Enron or
WorldCom.</TE>
<TE>   After marching under U.S. direction for the last two decades, more
Latin Americans than ever find themselves at the precipice of a dark
abyss. Economic decline, unemployment and political instability have
buffeted just about every nation on the southern continent and left
tens of millions of people with no notion of a future. As Chilean
novelist Ramon Diaz Eterovic recently put it, "Latin America today is
a volcano of pent-up pain."</TE>
<TE>   Consider this bleak panorama:</TE>
<TE>   Once-proud Argentina finds itself in possible death throes as a
nation. Anarchy knocks at the gates as the currency fails, the banks
are shuttered and the political class completely discredited.</TE>
<TE>   Tiny, ordinarily placid Uruguay, sometimes called the Switzerland
of Latin America, just went through its own currency scare and even a
fit of street rioting.</TE>
<TE>   The biggest economy in Latin America, Brazil, finds that its own
currency has slipped by as much as 20%. And as a left-of-center
presidential candidate nears victory this October, some American
officials can find nothing better to do than to trash-talk the
country's future.</TE>
<TE>   Venezuela, once awash in petrodollars, elected an unpredictable
radical populist after its old U.S-supported political establishment
engaged in a spate of kleptomania. A deeply polarized, highly
unstable political atmosphere was further aggravated when the Bush
administration stood on the sidelines cheering a failed coup attempt
earlier this year.</TE>
<TE>   In Peru, succeeding American administrations supported former
President Alberto Fujimori because of his commitment to free-market
policies. But when Fujimori fled the country after he was caught
stealing an election and running a secret spying operation, the U.S.
switched its support to the new president, Alejandro Toledo. But now,
after a year in office, Toledo has slipped to a dangerous 16% poll
rating, the electorate angry over his pro-Washington economic
policies of privatization.</TE>
<TE>   In Bolivia, where the political class faces mounting rejection,
the anti-American radical left made enormous gains in just-concluded
presidential elections.</TE>
<TE>   After $2 billion in U.S. military and economic support, Colombia's
civil war is bloodier than ever. And the White House now finds itself
supporting the newly inaugurated President Alvaro Uribe, who pledges
an escalation in the fighting and a rollback of political freedoms.</TE>
<TE>   Even Chile, the most stable of Latin American economies and held
up as a showcase by Washington, has evolved into one of the most
socially unequal countries in the hemisphere and now finds itself
haunted by what appears to be permanent unemployment levels of near
10%. There was street rioting recently over increases in bus fares.</TE>
<TE>   There is a message in this mess: What has been tried has not
worked. But the Bush administration, just as its predecessor, seems
incapable of accepting the obvious.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. has responded to this crisis, to the degree that there is
any response, by appointing a tainted and highly controversial Cold
War ideologue of the Iran-Contra era, Otto J. Reich, as the State
Department's political point man on Latin America.</TE>
<TE>   On the economic front, Treasury Secretary Paul H. O'Neill has
engaged in nothing short of public slapstick. First he roils the
entire continent by saying Argentina and Brazil should be denied
international bailouts lest the money wind up in "Swiss bank
accounts." Then the next week he flies to the region and heartily
endorses the same International Monetary Fund loan programs.</TE>
<TE>   For the president's part, he seems content that Congress has
cleared the way for fast-track approval of his Free Trade Area of the
Americas, a proposal to create a hemispheric free market pact
stretching from Argentina to Alaska.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, much like Dorothy in "The Wizard of Oz," Bush seems to
think that all he needs to do is click his heels three times to be
safely back home to hemispheric harmony: free trade, market
economies, democracy. Click, click, click.</TE>
<TE>   The beginning of the solution resides in Washington recognizing
that trying to dictate Latin America's terms of development doesn't
work. Repeating the mantras of the last two decades will no longer
cut it. More likely, such dogmatic insistence will only further fan
flames of discontent and render the continent even more antagonistic
to the U.S.</TE>
<TE>   When frustrated Latin American nations wander from Washington's
prescribed path, as Brazil now seems intent on doing, the U.S. should
be accommodating and flexible rather than stubbornly obstructionist
and hostile. Instead of trying to undermine popular left-of-center
candidates like Luis Ignacio Lula da Silva--now leading in the
Brazilian presidential race--the U.S. should seek common ground with
them. Washington should not continue to lecture its southern
neighbors that all will be saved when and if its vaunted Free Trade
Areas of the Americas is achieved. Such pacts tend to codify and
institutionalize already unequal power relationships, tying each
individual nation into a more dependent relationship with the U.S.,
and on trading terms always more favorable to the more powerful
partner.</TE>
<TE>   We need to offer Latin America a better choice than the current
one of either benign neglect or acquiescence to unfair international
economic pacts. Instead of promoting free-trade treaties that steeply
benefit U.S. corporate interests, we should be bolstering Latin
America's own trade round tables, like the Andean Pact and Mercosur.</TE>
<TE>   Latin America needs to be more integrated, more united, more
capable of solving its own problems--and more independent of the
United States. It must emerge as its own regional bloc, with its own
defined interests so it can negotiate on a dignified basis, much as
the European Union does with Washington. The U.S., in turn, must take
the risk of dealing with Latin America on its terms rather than
always on ours, honoring its agenda without assuming that our
southern neighbors will forever be our "junior" partners.</TE>
<TE>   Unfortunately, it would be naive to believe that this
administration, with its brazen and often reckless unilateralist
bent, is willing to reverse what has been a century-long policy of
paternalistic Latin America policy.</TE>
<TE>   But it's just as delusional to think that all those rumblings
we're starting to hear again from the south are somehow going to
magically dissipate.</TE>

<HD>The Rah-Rah Boys</HD>
<DH>There are no mea culpas from the gurus who prophesied an
unending bull market. They're still cruising from one posh gig to the
next.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>THOMAS FRANK</AU>
<BD>Thomas Frank is the editor of the Baffler magazine and
author of "One Market Under God."</BD>
<DL>CHICAGO</DL>
<LD>Many of the '90s icons have passed from the scene: The swashbuckling
dot-com entrepreneurs have moved back in with mom, the rule-breaking
CEOs are being hauled before Congress for tongue-lashings, the
day-trading seniors who were supposed to "beat the pros" are thanking
God that Social Security still exists. But one group remains
untouched: the public intellectuals of the bull market. The writers
of Dow-worshipping books and commentators who handed down daring
pronunciamentos from the silicon heights are still cruising from one
posh gig to the next.</LD>
<TE>   If you tuned in to CNBC at any point during the long, slow
meltdown of the last couple of months, you probably saw the news
reader turn to a representative of Forbes magazine, formerly one of
the world's most enthusiastic pushers of bull market optimism, now
cast as an expert on a market in retreat. If you kept watching for a
few hours, you probably enjoyed the surreal sight of James Cramer,
one of the late boom's most prolific publicists, trying to feign
outrage at the same forces he once cheered. And you undoubtedly gaped
in disbelief when you recognized Cramer's co-host as Larry Kudlow,
the hyperexuberant economist who once proclaimed from the op-ed page
of the Wall Street Journal that the free-market policies of the
Reagan/Clinton years were so profoundly correct that they would one
day cause the Dow Jones industrial average to hit 50,000.</TE>
<TE>   The Journal itself, far from showing contrition for its New
Economy excesses of a few years back, recently ran a defense of the
nation's beleaguered stock analysts by none other than James
Glassman, coauthor of the 1999 book "Dow 36,000." In his article,
Glassman argued that analysts from the big Wall Street firms are
being unfairly singled out for blame by killjoys like the New York
attorney general. "Every bear market requires a scapegoat," Glassman
wrote, "and this time the chosen victims are stock analysts."
Glassman is certainly right about the stock analysts. However guilty
they are for puffing the bubble, analysts alone shouldn't be forced
to bear the blame for the subsequent catastrophe. That burden should
be shared--by, for example, Glassman himself, the editors of the Wall
Street Journal op-ed page, Forbes magazine, Cramer and Kudlow.</TE>
<TE>   Messrs. Cramer and Kudlow should, by all rights, have been
sentenced to some kind of lengthy intellectual exile, required to
spend the next decade in a defunded public library somewhere, reading
the complete works of John Maynard Keynes. But a full year into the
slow-motion crumbling of the Nasdaq, CNBC decided instead to reward
these two great salesmen of the bull market with their own daily
program, where their thinkings, alternately frenzied and surly, can
reach an even wider audience than before.</TE>
<TE>   So too with Glassman. Instead of being required to write "I will
not confuse libertarian hallucinations with practical investment
advice" 36,000 times, he was indulged with a seat on President Bush's
21st Century Workforce Council.</TE>
<TE>   We are finally rid of the most egregious corporate swindlers of
the 1990s. Why aren't the intellectual snake-oil salesmen following
the dot-cons into oblivion? On the most elementary level, it's
because the nation's newspapers, think tanks, magazines and TV
networks have a great deal to lose were we to turn on the New Economy
theorists in the manner they deserve. If the intellectuals of the
'90s boom are to sink like the stock analysts and CEOs into the
depths of public scorn, those newspapers and think tanks would bear
the brunt too. After all, any comprehensive list of those guilty for
puffing the '90s bubble would read like a who's who of American
media.</TE>
<TE>   Try to remember what it was like in those feverish days. Virtually
everyone agreed: The stock market was a form of democracy. It was a
juggernaut powered by the divine inevitabilities of Silicon Valley
and the awesome assembly of the people of the globe. This was
well-nigh universal stuff: Both Tony Blair and Bill Clinton were
believers, as were Al Gore and George W. Bush. Small-town papers
across the country carried the stock-picking homilies of the Motley
Fool. Bookstores everywhere allowed you to choose between reassuring
stock tips penned by the Beardstown Ladies, a set of kindly
Midwestern grandmas and irony-drenched stock tips penned by the
Capitalist Pig, a hip Chicago Gen-Xer. Your next-door neighbor had
seen the light and was day trading from his rec room, and you were
thinking about doing it too.</TE>
<TE>   Another reason that so many of the hyperventilating pundits of the
1990s have proven impervious to the usual consequences of error is
that generating an accurate depiction of economic life really wasn't
their main function. When they told the world about the miracles of
the Internet and the obsolescence of all previous economic knowledge,
the public thinkers of the New Economy were interested in something
else.</TE>
<TE>   That something else was politics. After all, the central tenet of
the New Economy faith was that the free market was the highest and
most rewarding form of human existence, a notion that would have
seemed transparently ideological had it not always been couched in
the language of technology and in lofty phrases about the juggernaut
of history and the will of the common man. The great economic
commentators of the '90s didn't dissect the corporation so much as
propagandize for it, looking ahead to a time when the little people
would identify more with the corporation than with the government.</TE>
<TE>   Again, Glassman provides the apposite example. Marveling at the
great things that were to happen when we the people drove the Dow all
the way to 36,000, he and his coauthor wrote, "The first change we
expect is political." Just as "the crash [of 1929] was the catalyst
for the modern welfare state," so an eternally rising market will
have "the opposite effect. As more and more Americans gain a larger
and larger stake in stocks, their views undoubtedly will shift on
such matters as business regulation, taxes, antitrust policy, trade,
and even foreign affairs."</TE>
<TE>   Another clue to the real nature of the New Economy should have
been the right-wing pedigrees of a number of its most prominent
gurus. Glassman himself is a fellow at the American Enterprise
Institute. The banker Walter Wriston, who wrote an influential 1992
book about the wonders of the Information Age, was once one of that
institute's trustees. Kudlow worked for the Reagan administration,
the George W. Bush transition team and the right-wing Empower America
foundation. George Gilder, the most celebrated tech writer and stock
picker of the 1990s, the man who launched a thousand silicon
shibboleths, came to punditry after achieving considerable fame as an
ultraconservative political theorist and a speechwriter for President
Reagan.</TE>
<TE>   The prominence of these people and others like them were, to a
great degree, unrelated to their skills as economic prognosticators.
Their trade was politics, and at it they were wildly successful.
Americans were indeed persuaded to roll back the regulatory state in
the 1990s, to give the corporations whatever they wanted, to slash
welfare, to smash the labor unions and even to (sort of) elect the
most pro-corporate administration since Herbert Hoover's, headed by a
man who promised to privatize Social Security.</TE>
<TE>   Today, though, the picture has changed. And for most of last
year's gurus, the battle has simply shifted. Now it is a matter of
blame and they are on the defensive, fighting to rescue their beloved
free market with even more zeal than when they were talking up the
Nasdaq back in '98. The crash has brought the consequences that
crashes always bring: a return of the regulatory state, demands for
the end of excessive CEO pay, public anger at businessmen rather than
liberal college professors and--who knows?--maybe the revival of
labor unions and the estate tax. For the business class the stakes
are huge, and the job that confronts their army of economic
commentators is weightier than ever.</TE>
<TE>   Nevertheless, they have risen to the challenge with impressive
creativity, cranking out a thick smokescreen of blame evasion where
they once generated a fog of prosperity without limits. Whatever
happens, they argue, it cannot possibly be the fault of the market.
Never mind the fact that one of the very measures taken by
corporations in the '90s to ensure that market rationality
prevailed--the granting of stock options to top executives--is the
single greatest culprit in the present fiasco: Markets never fail.
Other parties, namely government, must be responsible. "This is
Washington's recession," a glowering Kudlow said a little over a year
ago, "for which nothing is more to blame than the arrogance of
policymakers, who refused in the first place to recognize the real
sources of prosperity and then refused to acknowledge that slumping
stock markets were a referendum on Washington's mistakes."</TE>
<TE>   Over the last year, dozens of candidates have been unearthed and
pushed forward, then abandoned out of self-evident absurdity. Kudlow,
for example, blamed the antitrust lawsuit against Microsoft. Gilder
blamed antitrust restrictions placed on WorldCom. Others got
indignant about taxes, which are always too high, since, by
definition, they are equivalent to theft, or about New York's lawsuit
against Merrill Lynch. With my own eyes I watched a TV show in which
business reporters blamed government policy for tripping up the good
people of Enron.</TE>
<TE>   A more forthright school of thought blamed the public. In good
times corporate ideologues had claimed to see the majesty of the vox
populi in every blip and surge of the Dow; why not simply invert that
argument in these desperate days? After all, it was "the Internet
enthusiasm of small investors" that caused the bubble, the Wall
Street Journal's Holman Jenkins wrote recently. It was mom and pop
who "bear primary responsibility for driving up stock prices of
speculative businesses and causing billions of dollars to flow into
the creation of assets for which there is no demand now."</TE>
<TE>   My personal favorite evasive maneuver, though, is the denunciation
of thought crime, of those who harbor doubt and negativity. Markets
can't take criticism, apparently, especially when it comes from
liberal Democrats. One would think that the gurus would keep their
distance from this line of blame assessment, as it seems to suggest
that the stock market is a fickle, pusillanimous institution, turning
tail at the slightest sign of adversity--which can hardly be
reassuring to the millions of investors being told that the market is
a safe place for their savings. Yet everyone from Tom DeLay to Rush
Limbaugh has been hitting this issue hard of late. Critics must be
silent or prosperity will never return.</TE>
<TE>   But Rush and the gang have the matter entirely upside down.
America's current problems stem not from an excess of dissent but
from the utter unaccountability of corporate apologists like Cramer,
Kudlow, Glassman and the Wall Street Journal. What was and is needed
in America is not the complete and final quieting of dissent but a
vibrant counterpoint to the chorus of promoters who virtually
monopolized economic discussion in the 1990s. What will prevent
bubbles and manias and mass delusions and maybe even bad government
is a new set of public thinkers willing at least to entertain the
notion that capitalism might not always allocate goods fairly or
efficiently; that markets may not always be synonymous with
democracy; that voting and collective bargaining are expressions of
the popular will every bit as legitimate as shopping and day trading.</TE>
<TE>   Maybe market meltdowns are what happen to a country when
commentary on matters economic becomes the exclusive province of
business thinkers. When labor unions are systematically crushed. When
dissent is divorced from matters economic or social and becomes
instead a quality of middle-class taste preferences, of "extreme"
cars and "radical" packaged goods. When management theorists take it
as their duty to dazzle us with a crescendo of free-market worship.
When leaders of left parties cleanse their ranks of laborites, of New
Dealers, of Keynesians, of socialists. When newspapers refuse to open
their columns--on grounds of laughable, self-evident dinosaurdom--to
doubters and second-wavers and old-school liberals.</TE>
<TE>   Today we are paying for each of these, for all of the ways in
which we expunged the common sense of our parents' America from our
lives. With each month's nauseating returns, we are making good the
intellectual folly of the last 10 years.</TE>

<AU>MICHAEL H. GRANOF and STEPHEN A. ZEFF</AU>
<BD>Michael H. Granof is a professor of accounting at the
University of Texas at Austin. Stephen A. Zeff is a professor of
accounting at Rice University.</BD>
<DL>AUSTIN, Texas</DL>
<LD>President Bush warned American corporations recently that the days of
"cooking the books" and "shading the truth" are over. Now he should
deliver the same message to the country's governors and mayors--even
to members of his own administration.</LD>
<LD>   The nation's current economic funk has government at every level
in a pickle. Revenues are down, nondiscretionary expenses are up: How
to balance the budget?</LD>
<LD>   It's not all that hard, it seems. Current corporate accounting
scandals notwithstanding, governments are still looking to balance
their budgets the old-fashioned way--with accounting legerdemain. The
results can be as pernicious as those of the bookkeeping abuses in
the corporate world. Governments pile up off-the-balance-sheet debts
that will have to be repaid by taxpayers of the future.</LD>
<TE>   A classic example: On April Fools' Day 1991, New York state
announced the sale of Attica prison for some $200 million, an amount
it counted as general revenues. Who was the buyer? The state of New
York in the guise of a specially created state agency, which financed
the acquisition by issuing bonds. The one problem with the scheme is
that bonds need to be repaid, and prisons are not known for
generating income. So to obtain the resources necessary to service
its debt, the new agency leased Attica back to the state. The state
operated the facility just as it did in the past. The rent payments
were exactly the same as the required interest and principal payments
on the debt. Not only that, the debt was guaranteed by the state.
This, of course, was more than a decade before Enron engaged in
similar asset sales, making "special purpose entities" a
near-household phrase. Another year, New York generated "income" by
selling the Cross-Westchester Expressway to itself.</TE>
<TE>   The accounting practices of state and local governments are under
the purview of the Governmental Accounting Standards Board (GASB),
which is to governments what the Financial Accounting Standards Board
is to corporations. But the board's responsibility is only to
establish the standards that governments must apply in annual
financial statements. In governments, though, the key financial
documents are not annual financial reports. They are budgets, and the
GASB has no control over the accounting practices in government
budgets. These are determined either by state statute or by local
prerogative.</TE>
<TE>   The budgeting practices of almost all governments preserve legal
fictions. Thus, even though a state may have economic and political
control over an agency that is technically a separate entity, it may
treat transactions with such an agency as though they were with
independent outsiders.</TE>
<TE>   Most state and local governments budget on a cash or near-cash
basis. Under the cash basis of accounting, governments recognize
revenues when cash is received and expenditures when it is paid. But
when preparing their annual financial statements, they must do so on
an accrual basis of accounting. Under the accrual basis, they
recognize revenues and expenses when transactions have a substantive
economic effect--for example, when goods or services are received and
used rather than when the check is drawn to pay for them.</TE>
<TE>   Needless to say, New York has no monopoly on fiscal sleight of
hand. In Texas, for example, state employees receive their paychecks
on the first day of the month following that in which they are
earned. State workers used to be paid a day earlier, on the last day
of the previous month. The one-day change was made so that in the
year of the shift the state was able to move one-month's salary costs
into the next year, thereby reducing compensation expenditures by
one-twelfth.</TE>
<TE>   Similar budgetary maneuvers that our elected officials have used
in the past, and can look to in these hard times, include advancing
the due date on taxes, licenses and other charges from one fiscal
year to the prior year, and delaying the date on which the state
makes its own payments to suppliers, contractors and welfare
recipients.</TE>
<TE>   Another well-proven budget-balancing technique is to reduce
contributions to pension funds. Because government pension plans are
typically "defined benefit," the amounts that employees will receive
upon retirement is set by the terms of the plan, not by the timing of
employer cash contributions. So, any payments not made in a current
year will have to be made in future years, plus interest.</TE>
<TE>   The federal government, unlike state and local governments, is not
required either by statute or constitutional mandate to balance its
budget. But that doesn't mean that its budget provides any more of a
meaningful insight into its true revenues and expenses. Like state
and local governments, the federal government budgets on a cash
basis. For the fiscal year ending Sept. 30, 2001, the federal
government reported a budgetary surplus of $127 billion. On an
accrual basis, however, it had a deficit of $515 billion. Most of the
difference can be attributed to pension and related benefits.
Generally accepted accounting principles require pension costs to be
recognized as expenses during employees' working years--when the
country gets the benefits of their services. The federal government
budgets the costs only as the employees receive their retirement
checks. The result is that the federal government is bequeathing more
than $600 billion in obligations to the next generation of taxpayers.</TE>
<TE>   Worse yet, the federal government's accounting system is in
disarray and therefore cannot be counted on to produce the numbers
needed to make reliable budget projections. The problems, however,
are not merely isolated in a few small departments. According to the
government's own independent auditor, the General Accounting Office,
the weaknesses in internal controls and various operating and
accounting practices are pervasive. Consequently the GAO is unable to
issue the standard auditor's opinion as to whether the government's
annual financial statements are fairly presented. Citing the
Department of Defense as the most culpable agency, it says that
overhauling the Defense financial management systems "represents a
major ... challenge that goes far beyond financial accounting to the
very fiber of the department's business operations and management
culture." The Securities and Exchange Commission would reject out of
hand the financial statements of any corporation that were
accompanied by such a negative audit report.</TE>
<TE>   As of last Wednesday, corporate CEOs had to certify to the
accuracy of their firms' financial statements. Imagine what would
happen if Bush and the nation's governors and mayors had to similarly
affirm the veracity of their governments' budgets.</TE>
<TE>   All these stratagems are not only legal but in the past have been
touted by politicians as creative revenue enhancements or cost
savings. Were one to ask voters whether they would prefer these
budget-balancing tactics or tax increases, they would undoubtedly opt
for the former. However, citizen reaction might be quite different if
one were to pose the question in what is perhaps the more honest
form: Do you favor passing on to your children the cost of services
that you benefit from today?</TE>

<HD>Passport to a Future</HD>
<DH>The benefits of an education in the United States transcend
borders. When foreigners win, the U.S. wins.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DINA KHAYAT</AU>
<BD>Dina Khayat is managing director of Lazard Asset
Management Egypt and is a graduate of Columbia University Business
School.</BD>
<DL>CAIRO</DL>
<LD>It was the fall of 1991 and I had just been accepted into a top-tier
business school in the United States. I arrived in New York from my
native Egypt, my 5-foot frame almost completely hidden by two huge
suitcases containing, among other things, silverware for the dinner
parties my mother assured me I would want to give. I had signed up
for a studio apartment facilitated by the university. I'm not sure
what I envisioned, but it was not the 100-square-foot cell that met
me when I unlocked the door. I was downstairs again in a moment,
arguing heatedly that these apartments could not have been conceived
with human beings in mind.</LD>
<TE>   Thus began one of the best and most fulfilling periods of my
life--certainly the most intense. While I didn't host the kind of
dinners my mother had imagined, I did, after nearly two years of
sharing misery and triumphs, make lifetime friends at school. The
education I received went well beyond the academic. A similar degree
may have been had in my home country at the American University in
Cairo, but in New York, a whole new world, infinitely more
challenging, more demanding in its intensity and competitiveness, had
opened up. Where I had previously coasted, I had to work hard and
extend beyond myself. Whereas in Cairo I had a whole support system
of family and friends to fall back on, in New York I had to build and
work on friendships before I could rely on them. I had to reach out
across cultural and religious divides. The results were so rewarding.</TE>
<TE>   It was in New York that I discovered that the Coptic Church, of
which I am a member, had Judeo-Christian roots; that some of our
traditions and rites, such as the way we recognize death, were rooted
in Jewish heritage. Like the Jews, we sit shiva for seven days. It
was in New York that I trained for and ran the marathon, an endeavor
that caused my family and friends back home to wonder whether I had
lost my mind.</TE>
<TE>   After graduation, I landed a coveted job that I could not have
gotten without my degree. Now based in Egypt, working for a U.S.
investment bank, I can cross effortlessly between the two cultures;
comfortable with local work norms and able to relax in my own
image-rich language, but also imbued with the mental discipline to
communicate in bullet points when necessary. It was the best
investment I ever made in my future. But it was also, I think, good
for America.</TE>
<TE>   Now, Congress has placed restrictions on foreign student visas,
and some legislators are calling for their suspension altogether.
That would be a pity. I understand the anxiety following the attacks
of Sept. 11 and the ensuing desire to lock and bolt the borders.
Tighter security measures are definitely in order, but extreme
measures such as keeping out foreign students run counter to U.S.
interests in the long term.</TE>
<TE>   Education is one of the most effective tools in the fight against
terrorism. To deny foreigners opportunities to study and work in the
U.S. is to forgo a potent public diplomacy tool and the chance to
shape both individual minds and world opinion. In addition to the
obvious merits of their education, students take back something less
tangible but no less important than book learning: firsthand
experience of the country and its people. They are unlikely to fall
for oversimplified and one-dimensional characterizations of America's
issues and motives. While a U.S. education won't buy unwavering
support for all U.S. policies--unquestioning loyalty is not, after
all, the American way--someone educated there is much less inclined
to see in every unpopular action a sweeping representation of what
America stands for.</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, students educated in America have much to offer their
home countries. In nation after nation, from Eastern Europe to Egypt,
these products of an American higher education often become the main
drivers of reform in their countries. Shaking off the socialist,
inward-looking ideologies they grew up with, theirs can be the
loudest voices calling for privatization, economic reform and a
general opening up of societies. In most cases, they will also be
staunch defenders of the U.S. Even those who criticize aspects of
American life do so from personal experience and with great nuance,
rather than by blindly parroting hysterical anti-U.S. propaganda. And
the benefits of interaction go both ways. Foreign students in the
classroom expose American students to different views and cultures,
which is essential to prevent a widening of the gap between Americans
and the rest of the world.</TE>
<TE>   It seems completely reasonable to more effectively monitor the
activities of those entering on student visas, to ensure that they
really are enrolled in universities and actually studying. But it's
also important to remember that those who come to the U.S. to study,
who willingly spend the time and money it takes, are doing so because
they want to improve their prospects, and hope is an antidote to
terror.</TE>
<TE>   We are in the end a function of our upbringing and exposure. Young
men dispatched to Afghanistan to fight alongside the moujahedeen
against the Soviet Union became easy pickings for the noxious, fiery
brand of extremism that cradled Osama bin Laden and gave birth to the
Taliban. Closed societies, not open campuses, are breeding grounds
for terrorism. Lacking a positive political agenda, these stifling,
oppressive systems, where questions are discouraged and questioning
penalized, deliberately breed and cultivate hatred as a unifying
political force. The U.S. should not leave the playing field to them.</TE>
<TE>   I remain Egyptian through and through. Nothing can come close, in
my besotted eyes, to this sunny, endearingly laid-back country where
I grew up. But in my years in the U.S., I developed a deep affection,
admiration and respect for America, for its freedom of thought and
expression, for its infinite possibilities and opportunities and,
most of all, for its unique ability to absorb different cultures
while allowing individualism to flourish. When the Sept. 11 attacks
took place, I watched in horror and disbelief from my living room in
Cairo. The terrorists had ravaged a city I love--and in the process
had also destroyed a piece of me. Because in the end, and unaware of
the transformation process, I carry indelibly a piece of America in
me.</TE>

<HD>A War of Words Against Iran</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELI J. LAKE</AU>
<BD>Eli J. Lake is the State Department correspondent for
United Press International. He has written frequently for the Weekly
Standard.</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>A funny thing happened on the way to war with Iraq. We declared war
on Iran.</LD>
<LD>   Mind you, this is not a war with tanks and infantry, the kind of
war many speculate the United States will launch against Iraq. Rather
it is a war of words. And through this new policy, the administration
has made clear publicly and privately that it would like to liberate
Iranians from Ayatollah Ali Khamenei's theocracy--and that it is
siding with those in the country arrayed against him.</LD>
<LD>   The heightened rhetoric reflects a gap between the administration
and the State Department, which had made clear its belief that reform
of Iranian society was possible through engagement with the country's
president, Mohammad Khatami--a notion the administration rejects.</LD>
<TE>   For a Cold War analogy, think of the Iraq war as Vietnam and the
Iran war as Poland. President Reagan never considered bombing Warsaw
to aid Lech Walesa's Solidarity movement, but U.S. support for the
Polish dissidents was clearly a strategy to help topple the Soviet
puppet government that imprisoned him.</TE>
<TE>   President Bush seems to be trying something similar with Iran. On
July 12 he released a short statement pledging American solidarity
with protesters challenging the mullahs in Tabriz and Isfahan. Three
weeks later, a top Bush advisor, Zalmay Khalilzad, followed up with a
speech to aWashington policy institute, in which he said formal
diplomatic relations are not possible with the current regime. On
Tuesday, Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld repeated his charge
that Iran had allowed Al Qaeda fighters to enter that country,
despite reports the previous week that Iran had turned 16 suspected
Al Qaeda members over to Saudi Arabia. And by late fall, the
Broadcasting Board of Governors, which oversees Radio Free
Europe/Radio Liberty, will unveil a new 24-hour AM Persian radio
station to broadcast pro-American news and U.S. pop music inside
Iran.</TE>
<TE>   Before the president's statement last month, the State Department
had refused to publicly comment on the demonstrations in Iran,
fearing American support would imperil demonstrators. Some Iran hands
worried that the administration's support for the freedom seekers
would sour cooperation between Iran and the United States in
Afghanistan and any potential cooperation with regard to Iraq. The
opposite happened.</TE>
<TE>   In spite of Khamenei's fiery speech Tuesday, in which he likened
Bush to Adolf Hitler, the Iranian government has quietly cooperated
with the U.S. on Iraq. The Iranians recently permitted two Shiite
Iraqi opposition leaders living in Tehran to visit Washington for
consultations on U.S. plans for Iraq. Ibrahim Hamoudi and Abdelaziz
Hakim, representing the Supreme Council of the Islamic Revolution in
Iraq (SCIRI), a coalition of Shiite opposition groups in southern
Iraq, participated Aug. 10 in a teleconference with Vice President
Dick Cheney along with leaders from five other Iraqi opposition
groups in town for the talks. Their visit to Washington was the first
time since 1993 that SCIRI's Tehran-based leadership was permitted to
visit the U.S. Iran provides the council with office space in Tehran,
and in the past, Iran's security services have armed SCIRI operatives
in southern Iraq. Hamoudi in an interview was careful to say that
Mohammed Bakr Hakim (who did not come to Washington) was the
organization's political leader but that the organization recognized
Khamenei as its religious and spiritual leader. Thus it's not
surprising that Hamoudi is confident "Iran will not stand against
helping the opposition in Iraq."</TE>
<TE>   And SCIRI is not the only opposition group supported by Iran that
the Bush administration sees as an ally in the coming war with Iraq.
In March, the leader of the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan, Jalal
Talabani, traveled to Tehran for consultations with the nation's
defense minister, former president and security services. These talks
took place more than a month after the president's State of the Union
address in which he dubbed Iran's government part of an "axis of
evil." In the meeting, Talabani received assurances that the 375-mile
border between his territory and Iran would remain open for trade. In
1995, the Iranians sold Talabani small arms, and they continue to
sell gasoline to the provisional Kurdish government he controls.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, the Iranians allowed the Iraqi National Congress--the
umbrella group the CIA helped form in 1992 to unite the disparate
Iraqi opposition--to establish a U.S.-funded office in Tehran last
year. Ahmad Chalabi, the group's co-founder, has visited Tehran twice
in the last two months. And last fall, the Iranians agreed to allow
the congress to erect a radio transmitter near the Iraqi border for
broadcasts into the country. Since early 2001, Chalabi has asked the
U.S. government to fund a program to send lightly armed rebels into
Iraq from Iran.</TE>
<TE>   This support for the opposition is particularly important if the
president hopes to pursue an Afghanistan-style military strategy
against Iraq in which local militias, with the assistance of U.S.
special forces and air cover, liberate the country.</TE>
<TE>   Iran's willingness so far to help the United States undermine
Saddam Hussein should come as no surprise. Iran and Iraq fought a war
between 1980 and 1988, and neither country has signed a formal treaty
ending the hostilities. While some commercial air flights--as well as
diplomatic contacts--have resumed between Baghdad and Tehran in the
last year, the Iranians have steadfastly refused Iraqi requests to
end support for Kurdish and Shiite rebel groups. As Talabani said in
a recent interview, "Iran has many friends inside the Iraqi
opposition and it wants to maintain influence inside any new regime."</TE>
<TE>   What is peculiar is that the same set of advisors and Washington
analysts who have most vigorously advocated military action against
Iraq are now also publicly advocating the harder line on Iran. In
November, the chairman of the Defense Advisory Board, Richard Perle,
former CIA Director R. James Woolsey and former Reagan administration
foreign policy advisor Michael Ledeen helped form the Coalition for
Democracy in Iran.</TE>
<TE>   The goals of the organization, according to its literature,
include publicly shaming Iran for its human rights abuses, its links
to international terrorism and its pursuit of weapons of mass
destruction. In other words, the group aims to make the same kind of
public case against Iran as Washington's hawks have made against
Iraq. Both regimes are at war with their own people, seek biological,
chemical and nuclear weapons and train and support terrorists.
Khalilzad in his Washington Institute speech accused the Iranians of
stockpiling chemical weapons that choke and blister their victims.</TE>
<TE>   None of this necessarily means the United States will be invading
Iran after it liberates Iraq. But it remains to be seen whether the
president's war of words with Khamenei will dampen the ayatollah's
support to end the regime of his neighbor. "The bottom line is Iran
has influence which can be used to complicate regime change going in
and going out of Iraq," Al Gore's former national security advisor,
Leon Fuerth, warns.</TE>
<TE>   So far, this is not a concern for Woolsey. "The more Khamenei
fears us, the more progress we are making," he says. "If he sees us
being weak and tentative that will make him jump in on Saddam's
side." For the sake of the Iraqi people, let's hope he's right.</TE>

<AU>PAULA R. NEWBERG</AU>
<BD>Paula R. Newberg is the author of of "Judging the
State: Courts and Constitutional Politics in Pakistan."</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>South Asians vote frequently and fervently. Its governments know how
to throw a good party, with huge rallies, long candidate lists and
rousing speeches; amid mayhem and the occasional murder, millions of
voters steadfastly fulfill their democratic duties. If elections are
an act of faith in political participation, South Asians are true
believers.</LD>
<LD>   But is their faith always justified? This question looms large in
the region this week, as Pakistan's military rulers prepare for an
October election that is unlikely to deliver what anyone needs.
Pakistanis are bracing for a contest that their president, Gen.
Pervez Musharraf, claims will restore civilians to some sort of
power. But the conditions he has set may make voters wonder whether
casting ballots solves anything at all.</LD>
<LD>   Pakistan's constitution ensures the right to vote, but that right
has been abused as often as it has been respected. At their best,
elections have not only allowed Pakistanis to choose their leaders,
freely and fairly, but also have helped clean up political abuses and
restore civilian government when the army has ruled for too long. At
their worst, however, Pakistan's elections are tepid, inconclusive,
manipulated affairs that imitate democracy without delivering it and
too often are nullified by coups d'etat.</LD>
<TE>   The October election is shaping up to be long on pretense and
short on goodwill, and may well add to the country's political
problems without solving a thing. After almost three years of
military rule, some people are itching to return to politics.
Seventy-one parties have successfully registered--58 others were
rejected--and even exiled leaders are itching to return to the fray.
But while elections can move politics forward, everything about this
one--from Musharraf's ambivalence about relinquishing power to the
dreary repeat performances of tired opponents--suggests a country
stuck in an unfinished past.</TE>
<TE>   Since his coup in October 1999, Musharraf has been clear about his
distaste for politics, politicians and, more generally, civilian
rule. October's elections were forced on him by the international
community and Pakistan's courts: In a grand compromise shortly after
Musharraf seized power, they allowed him to rule but pushed him to
set an election timetable. No doubt the army hoped election day would
never arrive. But while he is following the letter of the Supreme
Court's instructions, the spirit of the election he has engineered
has created a confusing political environment for candidates and
voters alike.</TE>
<TE>   Last April, after more than two years of restructuring the
government--ostensibly to clean up corruption but also to remove
irritating politicians from public life and office--Musharraf rigged
a referendum to extend his rule for five more years. He claimed that
his continued presence would lend stability to a notoriously insecure
and violence-prone country, but the effect of this unconstitutional,
unpopular maneuver was to undercut parliamentary powers.</TE>
<TE>   Musharraf has also worked hard to exclude troublesome politicians
and obstreperous parties to ensure that he gets only the parliament
he wants. Voters will elect a National Assembly in October, but the
Assembly won't be allowed to perform one of its primary
jobs--electing the president--because Musharraf is already there.</TE>
<TE>   Pakistan's travails, however, are much deeper than the reluctant
ambitions of one relatively amiable general. After decades of direct
military rule, interspersed with fragile civilian governments that
rely on army backing to retain even a modicum of authority, the army
calls the shots in Pakistan. It also calls the country's political
bluff, easily and often. Civilian leaders practice contradiction:
They often speak in carefully modulated democratic language but
equally often justify the army's primacy in government. Fearful of
being left out of politics, equally worried that elections will be
canceled if they protest too much, they rush to participate in almost
any kind of election, even if it is dreadfully flawed.</TE>
<TE>   These are the perpetual conundrums of Pakistan's creaky political
machine. Musharraf and the army, like so many of their predecessors,
think that politicians are weak and fatally ambitious; politicians
understandably believe that the longer they remain out of power, the
weaker the public will think they are and the weaker they will
become. The army sets the rules, the political elite complains and
obeys, and elections turn into superficial shows rather than
fundamental democratic processes. The basic role of democratic
elections--to create and ensure choice--is lost. In the process,
Pakistanis lose the chance to judge the future of democracy, which
seems unattainable, or Musharraf's rule, which simply won't go away.</TE>
<TE>   The problem is, Musharraf's diagnosis of Pakistan's ills, while
not quite correct, is not completely wrong, either. Pakistan has
become a place where corruption flourishes and democracy withers,
where poverty is hard to tame and accountability is harder to
sustain. But while the army thinks that politicians are the problem,
the army's governance has proved that military rule is certainly not
the answer. Musharraf's complicated reform agenda has turned
government inside out without solving basic social problems.</TE>
<TE>   The last three years may testify to the difficulties of reform,
but even more, they demonstrate that means and ends cannot be
separated. Reform--including reforming electoral politics--requires
democratic preparation, public participation and all the
inconvenience, convolution and imprecision that civilian politics
bring to civic life.</TE>
<TE>   Musharraf's political calculations underscore his understanding of
context and circumstances in setting the content and consequences of
political life. He knows the difference between the "free, fair and
transparent" election he has promised and the real one he has so
carefully choreographed. He realizes that Pakistanis are losing
patience with him and the world is rapidly losing patience with
Pakistan. He is bargaining that a partial transfer of power will be
enough to stave off external critics, and just enough to occupy
domestic opponents without giving them a real chance at power. After
all, with a global war on terrorism to worry about, will Pakistan's
donors and allies care much about one more failed election in one
more poor, troubled country?</TE>
<TE>   Surely they should. Once an international pariah, then South
Asia's best chance against terrorism, Musharraf's army rule now risks
becoming the worst kind of burden for Pakistan and everyone who deals
with it--an unfortunate, ineffective annoyance that might never
disappear. His election will be hard to salvage, so perhaps this is
the moment for Pakistan to return to the drawing board--to find a way
to ensure a full transfer of power, democratically. At the least,
this is where a new conversation about Pakistan might usefully begin:
imagining, aloud, the ways that Pakistan can triumph over its
self-defeating inheritances and allow its citizens to speak
forthrightly on their own behalf.</TE>

<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Millions of starving people in Zimbabwe have the European Union to
thank for their hunger. In early July, Zimbabwe rejected food aid
from the United States because the corn involved had been genetically
enhanced to protect it against insects. The decision wasn't based on
science. This current threat of mass starvation is the direct
consequence of a trade war over genetically improved crops that is
brewing between the United States and Europe.</LD>
<LD>   Zimbabwe has refused biotech corn because its government fears
that Europe would ban its agricultural exports if its farmers started
growing genetically improved maize. After all, since the mid-1990s,
the EU has banned the importation of genetically engineered crops
from the United States, claiming--entirely speciously--that they
aren't safe.</LD>
<LD>   One scientific panel after another has concluded that biotech
foods are safe to eat, and so has the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration. Even an EU review issued last fall of 81 separate
European scientific studies of genetically modified organisms found
no evidence that genetically modified foods posed any new risks to
human health or the environment. The European commissioner for health
and consumer protection, David Byrne, acknowledged last October:
"There is an irrational fear of GM food in the EU."</LD>
<TE>   It's clear that the EU ban is not so much a safety precaution as a
barrier to trade. The EU is citing phony safety concerns to protect
its farmers from competition and to protect its system of bloated
farm subsidies.</TE>
<TE>   For more than a decade the EU has banned the importation of
American beef treated with growth hormones. In 1997, the World Trade
Organization (WTO) ruled that the EU's ban was not based on
scientific evidence, but instead was a trade barrier. Rather than
allow the beef imports, the EU chose to accept countervailing duties
on more than $100 million of its exports to the United States.</TE>
<TE>   Fearing that the WTO would rule against their biotech crop ban,
the Europeans are now trying to execute an end run around the WTO.
Currently, the WTO requires that regulations be "based on scientific
principles" and that they not be "maintained without sufficient
scientific evidence." The European strategy to circumvent the clear
language of the agreement is twofold: to require labels on all food
products that contain ingredients made from biotech crops and to get
a sort of "precautionary principle" accepted as an international food
and health safety standard. The precautionary principle is an
anti-science regulatory concept that allows regulators to ban new
products or technologies on the barest suspicion that they might pose
some unknown threat. It is an approach of "impose a ban first, ask
questions later."</TE>
<TE>   The Europeans are trying to smuggle in the precautionary principle
via negotiations in two other international forums, the Codex
Alimentarius Commission and the new Biosafety Protocol. The former is
an intergovernmental body aimed at setting food standards under the
auspices of the U.N.'s Food and Agriculture Organization and World
Health Organization. In 1995, the SPS agreement conferred on the
codex commission the responsibility for setting international food
safety standards that would be recognized by the WTO. The EU has
succeeded in getting the codex commission to incorporate the
precautionary principle as well as traceability requirements into
several draft documents on risk and biotechnology.</TE>
<TE>   If the codex commission adopts those rules, it would mean that WTO
must accept them. And that means if the United States asks the WTO to
adjudicate its dispute with the EU over the banning of biotech crop
imports, America would lose.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the EU-backed Biosafety Protocol would require that all
international shipments of genetically modified crops bear the label
"May contain living modified organisms." This in turn would require
that biotech crops be segregated from conventional crops, which means
duplicating the entire shipping infrastructure of grain silos, rail
cars, ships and so forth at an estimated cost of at least $4 billion.
The price of grain, it is estimated, would rise by 12%.
Unfortunately, the Biosafety Protocol, which becomes effective after
being ratified by 50 nations, has already been ratified by more than
30 countries.</TE>
<TE>   What can the United States do to win this trade war and foster the
spread of GM foods? Fortunately, U.S. negotiators can stop the codex
commission process. Its standards must be agreed to by consensus of
all the parties. All the U.S. has to do is call a halt to the
precautionary principle, biotech labeling and traceability
requirements, and they'll be taken out of the codex commission.</TE>
<TE>   Countering the absurd regulations of the Biosafety Protocol is a
thornier problem. U.S. trade officials must make it clear that
importing countries that also grow biotech crops, such as China and
India, cannot set a double standard requiring traceability and
labeling of U.S. imports while exempting their own crops. The U.S.
should be able to show in the WTO that such double standards are
trade barriers, not safety regulations.</TE>
<TE>   Furthermore, the U.S. State Department and Office of the U.S.
Trade Representative must persuade major food-exporting countries
such as Argentina, Australia and Brazil to create a united front
against the EU, leaving Europe with no sources for nonbiotech feed
grain imports.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, the U.S. needs to devise a set of model biosafety
regulations so that developing countries will not simply adopt
onerous EU-style regulations by default.</TE>
<TE>   To protect their farmers from competition, the Eurocrats seem
willing to wreck the WTO and incidentally starve millions in the
developing world. The United States must prevent that.</TE>

<HD>Democracies Feel a Chill Wind From U.S.</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOSEPH SIEGLE</AU>
<BD>Joseph Siegle is the Douglas Dillon fellow with the
Council on Foreign Relations.</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Before Sept. 11, one concern about President Bush's veteran foreign
policy team was whether it still clung to world views shaped by the
Cold War. Could it adapt to emerging realities of the new era? The
terrorist attacks on the U.S. seemed to make this debate irrelevant,
starkly demonstrating the extent to which the world had changed.
Indeed, within weeks, Secretary of State Colin L. Powell declared
that we had now entered the post-post-Cold War era.</LD>
<LD>   Lately, though, many in the administration seem to have reverted
to the old Cold War rules, particularly in their support--or lack of
support--for democracy abroad. This shift has serious implications
for our national security. Consider the following:</LD>
<LD>   * In the Middle East, Bush has called for Palestinian democracy.
But this would be a peculiar kind of democracy, as the U.S. has
already announced that Yasser Arafat should not be elected. Aside
from the inconsistency of denying citizens the right to choose their
own president, this policy risks undermining the credibility of any
new Palestinian leader with the electorate, thereby diminishing the
prospect of negotiating a meaningful peace settlement with Israel.
More generally, it signals to the Arab world that we believe in
democratic processes only so far as they increase U.S. leverage.</LD>
<TE>   * In Pakistan, the U.S. has looked the other way while President
Pervez Musharraf has systematically dismantled democratic
institutions--first by extending his unelected stay in office by five
years through a trumped-up referendum and now by altering the
constitution so as to bar opposition leaders, subordinate the
parliament to his authority and severely restrict media.</TE>
<TE>   * In Afghanistan, more than 1,500 delegates representing
Afghanistan's broad ethnic diversity gathered in June for the
country's highly anticipated loya jirga to select the country's first
post-Taliban leader. The assembly opened with a lively exchange of
viewpoints, suggesting that participatory governance was perhaps not
impossible in this war-torn nation. Nearly 1,200 delegates signed a
petition nominating the popular former king, Mohammad Zaher Shah, as
the leader best able to reconcile the ethnically fractious and broken
country. Did the U.S. cheer this fledgling exercise in democracy?</TE>
<TE>   Far from it. Fearing that the support for Zaher Shah would upset
well-orchestrated plans to have Interim Prime Minister Hamid Karzai
selected as president, U.S. special envoy to Afghanistan Zalmay
Khalilzad pressed the former king to renounce his interest in
anything more than a figurehead role. Leaving nothing to chance,
Khalilzad then announced the king's intentions two hours before Zaher
Shah made his statement. In the end, loya jirga delegates left the
proceedings disillusioned with their first brush with democracy.</TE>
<TE>   * Closer to home, in April, the U.S. welcomed a coup attempt
against democratically elected Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez,
whose erratic behavior and anti-U.S rhetoric has angered the
administration. U.S. officials, it turned out, had held a number of
meetings with coup plotters before the short-lived rebellion. And
once Chavez was ousted, the administration was quick to back the new
government--despite having agreed to an Inter-American Democratic
Charter seven months earlier that explicitly rejected coups as a
legitimate means of succession.</TE>
<TE>   * In Bolivia, during the run-up to the June elections there, U.S.
Ambassador Manuel Rocha warned Bolivians that electing leftist
firebrand Evo Morales would jeopardize U.S. aid. This admonition was
echoed by Otto J. Reich, the U.S. assistant secretary of State for
Western Hemisphere affairs. But the statements backfired. Responding
with the independence typical of democratic citizens around the
world, voters rallied behind Morales, sending his poll numbers
sharply up and propelling him into a congressional runoff with
Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada, a U.S.-educated millionaire. Earlier this
month, the Bolivian Congress selected Sanchez, with the assistance of
heavy U.S. lobbying.</TE>
<TE>   These examples demonstrate clearly that, as in the Cold War, U.S.
foreign policy is not terribly concerned with fostering democratic
institutions abroad. We seem to be making the same faulty assumption:
that friendly autocrats offer better prospects for stability in the
developing world. What we should have learned from our Cold War
support to the shah in Iran, Sese Seko Mobutu in Zaire, Samuel Doe in
Liberia, Mohamed Siad Barre in Somalia, a string of Latin American
generals and others, however, is that this policy almost inevitably
comes back to haunt us. These "stable dictatorships" are, in fact,
rarely very stable. And when they collapse, frequently with
considerable violence, the tempests they spawn can engulf whole
regions. Meanwhile, the U.S. has earned the enmity of the repressed
population.</TE>
<TE>   The approach the U.S. has taken in these recent cases also seems
to overlook how much the world has changed since the Cold War.
According to Freedom House's annual Freedom in the World survey,
two-thirds of the states in the world today are democracies--nearly
double the number in 1988. The extent to which the global landscape
has democratized provides an enormous strategic advantage to the U.S.
Democracies have a remarkable record of not going to war with one
another. The more democracy expands around the world, therefore, the
better are the prospects for a global democratic peace. Democracies
also, by and large, do not breed terrorists. Recall that the Sept. 11
terrorists were all from nondemocratic countries. Democracies are
vastly more committed to combating the proliferation of weapons of
mass destruction. Finally, democracies perform better economically,
growing 30% faster than nondemocracies, on average.</TE>
<TE>   In this light, building a world of democracies is the overarching
race we are in. The more steadfastly we promote democratization in
the roughly 46 remaining authoritarian regimes, the faster we can
close the weak link in the global governance architecture. In a
forthcoming book, former Ambassador Mark Palmer sets the target of a
dictator-free world by 2025. Recognizing the strategic value of this
goal, our current policies should be judged by how well they are
moving us toward that aim. Our opponents in this race--the emerging
networks of terrorists and purveyors of weapons of mass
destruction--are counting on the cover provided by remaining closed
states to advance their destabilizing aims.</TE>
<TE>   It is to our advantage to assiduously encourage democratic
processes, even when it may seem inconvenient. We cannot expect
liberal democracies to bloom overnight, but we should press for
consistent improvement in the direction of greater openness,
political participation and economic opportunity. The
administration's decision last week to withhold new aid to Egypt in
reaction to its fraudulent conviction of human rights advocate Saad
Eddin Ibrahim is a step in the right direction. The world has become
too small to ignore blatantly unaccountable leadership.</TE>
<TE>   Undercutting democratic leaders with whom we disagree or propping
up undemocratic regimes with which we share interests undermines the
strategic objective of creating a global system of democratic states
that adhere to norms of rule of law, religious tolerance and the
delegitimization of terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   We can win this race to define the future, but we can't run it the
way we did during the Cold War.</TE>

<KH>NEWS IN BRIEF</KH>
<HD>Another Round of Refinancing Predicted</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Diane Wedner</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Defying predictions that the refinance market had reached its peak
and would begin to ebb, the continuing decline in mortgage interest
rates--which last week averaged about 6.3%--is now expected to spark
another round of refinancings and home buying, analysts say.</LD>
<LD>   The wave of expected new refinancings stems in part from the
Federal Reserve's acknowledgment Tuesday that the economy is
continuing to soften and from the expectation that the Fed will lower
its key short-term rate in September.</LD>
<LD>   "We just revised our forecast for this year to $2 trillion in
total loans, with at least a trillion dollars in refinancings," said
Doug Duncan, chief economist for the Mortgage Bankers Assn. of
America. "These numbers could match our 2001 record, the biggest in
history."</LD>
<TE>   Mortgage interest rates typically don't move in tandem with the
Fed's key short-term rate, which is the interest banks charge each
other on overnight loans. Rather, mortgage rates tend to follow
long-term bond yields--specifically, the 10-year Treasury note yield,
which last week dropped briefly to 3.96%, for the first time since
1963.</TE>
<TE>   As stocks have tumbled this summer, some investors have taken
money from stocks and invested in bonds instead, helping to drive
yields lower. That has created an environment in which borrowers who
already refinanced this year are eager to do it again, said Doug
Perry, first vice president of Countrywide Home Loans.</TE>
<TE>   Consumers want to refinance to remodel homes, buy a car, pay
college expenses or pay down credit card debt.</TE>
<TE>   "What's most important is that this refinancing activity is
producing a lot of money to be spent by consumers," said Bob Gahagan,
a manager at American Century Investment Management.</TE>
<TE>   And that, analysts say, helps the economy in the short and long
term.</TE>

<HD>Major Insurers Drop Coverage for Mold</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>from staff and wire reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Homeowners seeking insurance coverage for mold damage may find it
increasingly hard to come by.</LD>
<LD>   State Farm, the nation's largest home insurer, recently announced
it has eliminated coverage for mold damage in 33 states, not
including California.</LD>
<LD>   Even in cases in which the mold resulted from damage covered by
the insured's policy, the company will no longer pay to eliminate the
fungus.</LD>
<TE>   The action is the result of the $1.3 billion the insurance
industry paid last year to remove mold and repair mold damage in
households nationwide.</TE>
<TE>   State Farm, after losing more than $5 billion last year, also has
declared a moratorium on new homeowners policies in 17 states,
including California.</TE>
<TE>   "Mold, and especially water, have had a dramatic impact on
homeowners' claims across the board," said Candysse Miller, executive
director of Insurance Information Network, an insurance-industry
trade association.</TE>
<TE>   "We've seen these claims multiply exponentially over the last five
years. That has resulted in about $2 billion worth of water-related
claims in California alone, which is larger than most natural,
declared disasters."</TE>
<TE>   Allstate, the nation's second-largest carrier, has added language
to homeowner policies clarifying that it does not cover mold and
other related fungal problems unless the problems arise from events
already covered by the policy.</TE>
<TE>   Under that scenario, coverage will be limited to $5,000, an amount
far smaller than most current mold claims.</TE>
<TE>   The California insurance department already has approved 247
mold-exclusion filings that will allow insurers to drop or limit mold
coverage on new policies.</TE>

<LD>This is one of 27 cottages built starting in 1920 and owned by the
Huntington Hotel in Pasadena. Known as Ferncroft Cottage, the house
was remodeled in 1926 by architect Sylvanus Marston.</LD>
<LD>   By 1996, it was one of 13 cottages still standing when the hotel
sold the cottages to private owners. This one was purchased by
Cheryll and Bud (William) Wegge, who owns Wegge Motors in Pasadena.
She owns an interior design firm.</LD>
<LD>   The Wegges completely refurbished the cottage, which is in a gated
community adjoining the hotel. The hotel, now known as the
Ritz-Carlton, also underwent changes.</LD>
<TE>   The Wegges are planning to renovate another cottage that is
slightly larger and not fully remodeled. The couple need more space
to accommodate their married children and their families when they
come to visit.</TE>
<TE>   About this home: The Wegges installed copper plumbing, two-zone
heating and air conditioning; electrical wiring; speakers; and
recessed lighting.</TE>
<TE>   Cheryll Wegge, a designer for 32 years, applied her experience to
the interiors. Among her touches are the many imported and antique
materials used in the finish work. There's a stone sink once used in
a castle; French tiles that decorate a fireplace mantel; and antique
limestone floors in the entry. Blocks of stone from France were used
for a fireplace surround, and there's a hand-painted mural on a
multi-coved ceiling. Pavers from an old winery in France accent the
kitchen.</TE>
<TE>   Asking price: $2.15 million.</TE>
<TE>   Size: The 3,495-square-foot house has two bedroom suites and a
two-car garage with a gated driveway.</TE>
<TE>   Features: The French Regency-style home also has a library, a
great room, a wine cellar, three fireplaces, an
office/studio/exercise room, a garden retreat and free access to the
Ritz-Carlton's tennis courts, pool and spa. Food and maid services
are available for a fee.</TE>

after they are married, have been living in separate condominiums in
a Wilshire Boulevard high-rise.</LD>
<LD>   Lachey listed his condo a couple of months ago at $1 million but
the sale price has since been reduced to $989,000. Or the condo may
be leased for $7,000 a month; furnishings are negotiable.</LD>
<TE>   The nearly 2,000-square-foot condo has two bedroom suites, a
living room and a dining room plus a patio with a northern city view.
It also has a state-of-the-art kitchen and bathrooms with imported
Spanish tiles.</TE>
<TE>   Simpson's unit is on the market at $925,000 or may be leased at
$6,000 a month. Her condo is two floors lower in the 20-story
building. The 1,600-plus-square-foot unit also has northern views,
indoor and outdoor living rooms, a stone fireplace and two bedroom
suites.</TE>
<TE>   The tower was built about 20 years ago and has a clubhouse,
concierge, pool, spa, exercise room and valet parking.</TE>
<TE>   Simpson, 22, started singing on the gospel circuit at age 11, and
she was signed to Sony Music in 1997. With a reported five-octave
range, Simpson has recorded such successful singles as "I Wanna Love
You Forever," "I Think I'm in Love With You" and "Where You Are," a
duet she sang with Lachey.</TE>
<TE>   She was raised in Dallas, where her father was a youth minister.
Her image of having strong moral convictions and a positive attitude
has made her a role model for teenage girls. Simpson started dating
Lachey when she was 19. They were engaged in February.</TE>
<TE>   Lachey, 28, is one of the four members of the pop group 98
Degrees, with whom Simpson toured in 1999. Among 98 Degrees' hits was
the Latin-influenced "Give Me Just One Night (Una Noche)" and the
group's debut single, "Invisible Man," released in 1997.</TE>
<TE>   Lachey grew up in Cincinnati. His younger brother Drew is also a
member of 98 Degrees.</TE>
<TE>   Betty Lethe and Heidi Lake of Sotheby's International Realty,
Beverly Hills, have the listings.</TE>
<TE>   Helen Hunt has sold her newly built Hollywood Hills home for $8.3
million.</TE>
<TE>   The Oscar-winning actress ("As Good as It Gets," 1997) listed the
estate at $8.9 million as soon as it was completed in March. The
home, on nearly 10 acres, includes a tennis court, two office suites
and a screening room with a lobby and a wet bar.</TE>
<TE>   About three acres of the gated property once belonged to actor
Errol Flynn. Later, the Flynn estate was purchased by singer-actor
Rick Nelson. The house that Flynn and Nelson owned was torn down
before Hunt bought the site in 1997. Hunt's plans to live in such a
large home changed, but she carried on with building the house and
expanded the grounds by buying adjacent lots.</TE>
<TE>   Hunt, 39, never lived in the home but had considerable input in
its design. It was her idea to build a 1,000-square-foot porch with
San Fernando Valley views.</TE>
<TE>   The Pacific Palisades home of the late bandleader Les Brown has
been sold for close to its $2.3-million asking price.</TE>
<TE>   Brown, who died at 88 in January 2001, had owned the home since
1996. Built in 1960, the nearly 4,000-square-foot house has three
bedrooms plus maid's quarters and a large family room, which
overlooks a patio and a pool. The house sits on a knoll and has a
circular driveway.</TE>
<TE>   Les Brown and his Band of Renown made the hit parade in the '40s
with such songs as "I've Got My Love to Keep Me Warm." He recorded
"Sentimental Journey" with singer-actress Doris Day in 1945. Until
about five months before he died, Brown was still touring with his
band. He was also a longtime bandleader for Bob Hope. His son, Les
Brown Jr., now leads the band.</TE>
<TE>   Mimi Littman of Coldwell Banker, Sherman Oaks, represented the
trustee for Brown's estate. Joyce Gottlieb of Coldwell Banker,
Brentwood Court, represented the buyer.</TE>
<TE>   Independent producer Reba Merrill has sold her oceanfront Malibu
home of 14 years for about its $1.5-million asking price. The house
has two bedrooms and a den plus a rental unit with street and beach
access.</TE>
<TE>   Merrill is currently producing video publicity for the movies
"Signs," "Reign of Fire" and "XXX."</TE>
<TE>   Suzanne Altfeld and Kathleen Lawrence of Gilleran &amp; Griffin
Realtors represented both sides of the deal, and they handled
Merrill's purchase of a condominium in Santa Monica.</TE>

<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Time to reorder. The slip that marked the halfway point of my money
market account checkbook told the story. It reminded me that I had
written five checks already. None of them had been cashed.</LD>
<LD>   "What would you like me to do with your check?" the voice on the
other end of the phone would ask apologetically. "Oh, just mail it to
me," I'd reply. "I'll tear it up."</LD>
<LD>   Repeatedly, so-called good-faith deposits written from my realty
nest-egg account were unnecessary. I didn't get the latest house,
either. Same story--not the little carriage house in Echo Park, nor
that one in Pasadena with the built-ins whose charm overshadowed the
asbestos ceilings, nor the cottage in Burbank with the granite
kitchen counter tops and gleaming hardwood floors, assets that helped
one overlook the fake rock siding from the '50s.</LD>
<TE>   My offers, counteroffers, counter-counteroffers came in second or
third or were not even in contention. I was the one who needed the
good faith.</TE>
<TE>   I'm a first-time buyer. I have a respectable 10% down payment
(give or take a few dollars, depending on how high the bids go). I
have a good job with a paycheck that comes every two weeks. I am
pre-approved by several lenders. Oh, and get this: I have a FICO
score of 777-plus. I fax it proudly with my offers, like a college
applicant with her SAT scores, in case other factors haven't proven I
am house-worthy.</TE>
<TE>   A loan broker in Texas I speak to often to get my pre-approval
letters for various amounts on different properties said I could have
more money if I wanted, lots more. "Is it really that bad out there?"
he asked. I no longer gave him my file number. He knew my voice. Ah,
yes, that woman in California who kept begging people to sell her
their property.</TE>
<TE>   There were others. One in Ohio. Another in Orange, who said, "Oh,
please let me bid on your loan. Don't get a loan without talking to
me." I didn't need their loans, even if mortgage money was--at the
lowest rates in years--practically free. I had nothing to buy.</TE>
<TE>   My friends and family at first asked, "When are you going to buy a
house?" Then, when I tried and failed and tried and failed again,
they would joke: "So, bought a house lately?" My real estate
transactions became a taboo subject. They were afraid to ask.</TE>
<TE>   The counsel I did receive went something like this: "Maybe you
should try [insert town name]." "Maybe you should go to my Realtor."
"How much? That's ridiculous." "Maybe you should try to find a house
no one else wants."</TE>
<TE>   I tried that. I went to see a major fixer in the mid-city area
where drug dealers were waiting outside to make their next buy from
the current renters, who wouldn't let anyone in to see the house
except for a few hours of the day. The place was crawling with real
estate agents and would-be buyers traipsing over filthy velvet
couches.</TE>
<TE>   I decided my budget wouldn't allow me to buy the house and make it
livable. I declined to make an offer on that one (although I brought
along a pre-approval letter, just in case). Those sellers didn't need
my offer; they already had eight.</TE>
<TE>   I had participated in an eight-way offer in north Pasadena. It was
a cute house, and I wanted it, so I stretched my budget and offered
$16,000, or 6%, more than the asking price. As it turned out, I
wasn't even in the running.</TE>
<TE>   At first, I read about home buying voraciously, hoping to find a
secret plan I hadn't thought of. What could that be? I was already
stalking Realtor caravans. I had four agents--one in every community
in which I was interested in living--just to cover the bases. I
carried a wallet-sized card that allowed me to calculate my monthly
payment at today's going interest rate at any given price.</TE>
<TE>   Over time, it's gotten easier. It's become a competitive sport,
although I admit I'm playing on a losing team this season.</TE>
<TE>   I used to tear up when that rejection call came. But I knew I had
evolved when my agent's voice cracked upon delivering the news that
the fifth check wouldn't be needed either. We had reversed roles.</TE>
<TE>   "It's OK," I told her. "There will be other houses."</TE>
<TE>   And I have five checks left.</TE>

<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The remodeling project that filled Ian Denchasy's kitchen with pine
cabinets, a granite-topped island, maple counters and high-end
appliances started in April 2001, but the seeds for his dream were
sown in his San Francisco childhood.</LD>
<LD>   "I grew up in the kitchen with my mother, to keep me out of
trouble," Denchasy said, explaining that his mother "was the most
phenomenal cook." Half Hawaiian, she prepared many tropical dishes
and "tons of seafood."</LD>
<LD>   Little Ian was so enthralled with cooking that his mother hoped he
might go to cooking school and become a chef. Though he became an
English teacher and later a director of information technology, the
passion for cooking stayed with him.</LD>
<TE>   During his college years at Cal State L.A., friends knew that if
they needed a meal, they could go to Ian's and he would feed them.</TE>
<TE>   Later, when he and his wife, Alicia, lived near the Venice
boardwalk, "we'd have 30 people for breakfast" every Sunday, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Five years ago the couple bought their 1940s Mar Vista bungalow.
"No way this kitchen will stay," Denchasy said.</TE>
<TE>   It was clean and tidy but cheaply constructed; the particleboard
cabinets were falling apart.</TE>
<TE>   But it wasn't until his son, Keleii (which means "chief" in
Hawaiian), was born 3 1/2 years ago that the kitchen became a
problem. "We didn't have room for the food," Denchasy said. The
16-cubic-foot refrigerator was so tightly squeezed by cabinets that
it was impossible to replace it with a larger model.</TE>
<TE>   The final push for the kitchen came when Denchasy realized he'd
"just had enough" of his computer career and finally decided to
pursue his mother's dream. He begins classes at the California School
of Culinary Arts in Pasadena with hopes of becoming a cooking
teacher.</TE>
<TE>   At the outset, the couple decided on a budget of about $15,000 to
replace the cabinets and counters--work that Denchasy felt he had the
skills to do with a helper--and buy a new refrigerator.</TE>
<TE>   After a trip to Home Depot and the selection of $6,000 worth of
cabinets, Denchasy hung plastic sheeting between the kitchen and the
adjacent living room and started demolition with a pry bar and
sledgehammer. From that point on, however, the magnitude of the
remodel began to grow as Denchasy experienced one realization after
another.</TE>
<TE>   "Why should there be a wall dividing the kitchen and the living
room?" he asked himself. After all, it was not a load-bearing wall.</TE>
<TE>   "Keep that ugly vinyl floor? And those old appliances?" he
wondered. "They're going to be totally out of place in that nice new
cabinetry, aren't they?"</TE>
<TE>   The project ultimately ballooned out of control when Denchasy,
standing on a ladder, "noticed a smell that disgusted me" wafting
from the ceiling. "It was 50 years of cooking odors."</TE>
<TE>   Gripping a tool called a Sawzall, he started to slice through the
ceiling. When a piece of it buckled and came crashing down behind
him, the plastic sheeting tore and dust filled the house. He was, in
his words, "a guy gone amok."</TE>
<TE>   Although Alicia wasn't happy that her husband had made a major
remodeling decision without her input, she soon got into the spirit
of his suggestion: "Let's design an entire kitchen the right way."</TE>
<TE>   "You go with the flow and say, 'Why not?' " she said.</TE>
<TE>   Fortunately, the destruction of the kitchen took place quickly,
within the three-day window that the Denchasys had to change their
cabinet order to match their new vision. With a friend and the help
of the Home Depot design desk, the couple planned out the project.</TE>
<TE>   Removal of the old ceiling allowed them to raise the ceiling all
the way up to the roofline, with a decorative beam between the
kitchen and living room, which had now become a great room.</TE>
<TE>   Ian knew he wanted a built-in refrigerator and a 36-inch stove. It
was during a trip to a Home Depot expo that Alicia got energized, at
one point lobbying for a 48-inch Viking range. Eventually she
relented: "You can only fit so much into the square footage."</TE>
<TE>   They finally settled on a 36-inch, copper-trimmed Dacor with an
electric oven, flame broiler, full convection capacities and six
massive gas burners. "This thing spits out 20,000 BTUs of heat," Ian
said.</TE>
<TE>   They also bought a GE Monogram refrigerator, dishwasher and wine
chiller, two Kindred sinks and KWC professional dishwashing fixtures,
one of which was listed at more than $1,000. "Could it be as cool as
it looks?" Ian had asked himself when he looked at it in a catalog.
"It was more cool."</TE>
<TE>   Though his mood was lifted by the dreaming, designing and
shopping, he worried that he had gotten in over his head. That was
confirmed after he framed the volume ceiling with lumber and asked a
friend to come over and hang the drywall. The angles were all wrong.</TE>
<TE>   With a toddler to look after, a house full of dust and no kitchen
in which to prepare meals, "it was horribly stressful," Alicia said.
"You can't relax.... You get tired of it."</TE>
<TE>   Ian finally asked for help from Peter Lucas, a carpenter, builder,
artist, set designer and actor who was recommended by a friend.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't have what it takes," Ian said. "Cooking's my thing. This
is not my thing."</TE>
<TE>   Lucas pointed out how much they had accomplished and what a great
plan they had. Then he offered a practical suggestion: "Let's get the
cabinets off the floor and get those hung."</TE>
<TE>   Piece by piece, he worked with Ian to get the ceiling finished,
the electrical system rewired, the plumbing hooked up, the counters
and fixtures installed and the floor laid. Because there were no
structural changes, engineering work was not required. The final
touch was an Old World, sponged-on paint job.</TE>
<TE>   By the time it was over, the couple had spent $42,500. Despite the
bloated budget, Ian is thrilled with the kitchen.</TE>
<TE>   "This is my dream come true," he said. "Food is love. I believe
that. And I give a lot of love."</TE>
<TE>   He and Alicia enjoy entertaining friends. For a recent block
party, Ian prepared his "special baby back ribs that people die
for"--roasted, then smoked, with a sweet-spicy sauce.</TE>
<TE>   Keleii has also become a cook, helping his dad make cookies and
pies, and preparing breakfast some mornings. "I'm inviting him [into
the kitchen]," Ian said.</TE>
<TE>   Like his mother, Ian thinks his son might choose cooking as a
career. "He might be a famous chef," he said.</TE>
<TE>   But like his father, Keleii has other ideas about his future. "I'm
going to be like Michael Jordan," the boy said.</TE>

<HD>Narrowing the Elder-Care Search</HD>
<DH>An online referral service is a step in the right direction
to helping seniors find the best assisted-living facility.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARY UMBERGER</AU>
<BD>CHICAGO TRIBUNE</BD>
<DL>CHICAGO</DL>
<LD>In a recent 24-hour period, I toured seven assisted-living
facilities, looking for a new home for elderly family members who no
longer could live on their own.</LD>
<LD>   I got nowhere.</LD>
<LD>   Oh, sure, they were lovely places. These assisted-living homes--in
which seniors live in apartments on a relatively independent basis,
supported by in-house health, nutrition and social services--were
impressive. All were clean and tastefully decorated.</LD>
<TE>   It's just that all of these places had one drawback or another.
The units were too small, or the services seemed inadequate. Or they
were stunningly expensive. We put more than 100 miles on the car,
just looking.</TE>
<TE>   Toward the end of our forced march, my brother said, "You know,
there ought to be a brokerage for these places, a centralized
service--kind of like a real estate agent."</TE>
<TE>   Turns out, there are such resources, sort of. But as a specialized
profession, it's in its infancy. The elder-care referral business
ranges from Internet listings--most of them too sketchy, in my
view--to government agencies to entrepreneurs who see a vast market
in people like me, people who are time-pressed and worried.</TE>
<TE>   "There is such a huge need, from the family's perspective," said
Pamala Temple. Her 2-year-old Seattle company, a Place for Mom, is
taking an interesting stab at it. It's not a brokerage, but a
referral service.</TE>
<TE>   It's a dot-com (www.aplaceformom.com) that puts people who are
looking for elder care in touch with one of 25 counselors around the
country. The counselors help clients sort out their
needs--independent versus assisted living, in-home care versus
nursing home, etc.--and then make referrals to specific businesses.
Care providers pay the company's fee.</TE>
<TE>   Temple says that, to her knowledge, hers is the only company
aiming to provide such services on a national basis, though many
localities have "geriatric care managers." That's an emerging related
field, in which families of senior citizens hire a specialist to
tackle a range of needs, from finding housing to managing day-to-day
affairs for the senior when relatives live too far away to handle
them. The National Assn. of Professional Geriatric Care Managers' Web
site is www.caremanager.org; telephone (520) 881-8008.</TE>
<TE>   Another group, the Seniors Advantage Real Estate Council in
Murphys, Calif., trains real estate agents who want to specialize in
buying and selling seniors' properties.</TE>
<TE>   It seems there ought to be a place in the market for an
"elder-care multiple-listing service" with retirement facilities'
floor plans, costs, services, maps--availability of units--all in one
place. Temple is a speech pathologist by education who has worked in
marketing in assisted living.</TE>
<TE>   "It gave me some good insight to what people are dealing with,"
Temple said. "You don't want to go to 48 care providers. You can't.
You want somebody to say, 'Here, try these three.' "</TE>

<LD>DOCTOR GLAS</LD>
<LD>   By Hjalmar Soderberg,</LD>
<LD>   Translated from the Swedish</LD>
<TE>   by Paul Britten Austin</TE>
<TE>   Anchor Books: 150 pp., $12 paper</TE>
<TE>   Some readers complain that the fiction of the last few dec-ades
has been lacking in meaning and morality. The ques-tion of whether
important litera-ture should offer us a mirror or a roadmap for our
lives depends on both the author and the times. Some people think
they have useful advice to pass along. Others are more comfortable
writing what they know. (I used to think this was gender related--men
wrote road maps, women wrote mirrors--but there are too many
exceptions to make a rule.) In fiction however, with rare exceptions,
the novels with the greatest shelf-life (generations of shelf-life)
force us to ask moral questions and usually provide the answers
(upside-down, in the back, like crossword puzzles).</TE>
<TE>   "Doctor Glas," first published in 1905, was Swedish author Hjalmar
Soderberg's most popular novel. It is written in the form of a
journal (but this device disappears into the story almost
immediately), written by a small-town doctor in his 30s. In the
journal, Doctor Glas works through several moral dilemmas: Questions
of euthanasia, suicide, abortion and finally, murder, enter into his
internal debates. At the heart of these questions is the value of
life; what makes one life more valuable than another? "What I set
down on these pages isn't a confession," he insists. "What a
profession! How can it have come about that, out of all possible
trades, I should have chosen the one which suits me least? A doctor
must be one of two things: either a philanthropist, or else avid for
honours. True, I once thought I was both."</TE>
<TE>   Dr. Glas values prestige and reputation and clear-headedness. He
despises sloppy sentiment. He has never been in love. He prizes
beauty above all things, though he has never had a relationship with
a woman. He is a fan of the knight in shining armor, true love, over
what he sees in real life: love in all its baser forms. For a doctor,
he is not very physical, has a quick distaste for sex and
reproduction: "Why must the life of our species be preserved and our
longing stilled by means of an organ we use several times a day as a
drain for impurities?" he asks himself.</TE>
<TE>   Life presents him with a cause, a chance to act on his
philosophies and he takes it. The victim is an ugly vicar who imposes
his affections on his own beautiful wife, who has appealed to Dr.
Glas for help. "Look at your world from your own point of view, not
from some point in space," he advises the reader. Written in a world
before the two world wars, the novel has an icy wind in it, a sense
of weeding the world so that only the strongest and loveliest can
live. Soderberg offers both a moral and a roadmap. These days, that's
a fairly distasteful combination.</TE>

<TE>   GOODBYE TSUGUMI</TE>
<TE>   By Banana Yoshimoto</TE>
<TE>   Translated from the Japanese</TE>
<TE>   by Michael Emmerich</TE>
<TE>   Grove: 186 pp., $22</TE>
<TE>   I've read Banana Yoshimoto over the years, I must confess, for
purely cultural reasons. I have hoped that her fiction could teach me
something about the younger generation in Japan, where she is
overwhelmingly popular, and about Japanese society in general. In the
end, I think it is probably Yoshimoto I learn the most about. Her
style is firmly planted in her own consciousness; resolutely unique.
It is a colloquial style, usually written in an unabashed first
person that moves so slowly through the world, training the reader to
speak the childlike language of her main characters, that it is
impossible not to become acutely aware of the power of perception
over reality.</TE>
<TE>   In "Goodbye Tsugumi," Maria Shirahawa is a young woman from a
seaside town in rural Japan. Her closest friend in the world is
Tsugumi, the beautiful but terminally ill daughter of the local inn
owners. Both Maria and her mother work in the inn until they move to
Tokyo, where Maria will go to college and her mother will join
Maria's father, who has been commuting between the city and the
seaside for many years.</TE>
<TE>   Every so often, Maria exclaims that the world seems slightly out
of whack, and it is as though Yoshimoto has shaken the snow globe
that houses the novel to create a temporary storm. "Every so often
I'll have one of those really bizarre nights. Nights when space
itself seems to have shifted a little out of line, and I feel I'm on
the verge of seeing everything all at once." In fact, underneath the
novel's calm exterior (it is really an agonizing slowness) is a kind
of hysteria that keeps one reading.</TE>
<TE>   Something's got to give. Yoshimoto's great talent lies in keeping
this tension alive for an entire novel. A reader forgets that nothing
ever actually happened, and is happily ready to pick up the next one,
none the wiser. Yoshimoto doesn't pretend to give her readers advice
about the world other than, perhaps: Watch out, because things can
get really weird out there.</TE>

<HD>The Wound That Refuses to Heal</HD>
<DH>THE WRITER AND THE WORLD: Essays, By V.S. Naipaul, Alfred
A. Knopf: 526 pp., $30</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>VIVIAN GORNICK</AU>
<BD>Vivian Gornick is a contributing writer to Book Review.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>If ever there was a writer who made a supreme virtue out of an
enduring necessity, surely that writer is V.S. Naipaul. The virtue is
the bright, burning development of an unusually strong intelligence;
the necessity is a temperament that nurses humiliation as one would
nurse a seeping wound. The result: 50 years of literary
interpretation of this, our one and only world, almost exclusively in
terms of its crippling meanness. Naipaul is often coupled with
writers such as Conrad and Forster because they, too, wrote of
colonial Africa and India, but his true counterpart is Jonathan
Swift, whose brilliant prose was also put to work to demonstrate
human existence as the sum of its disabilities.</LD>
<TE>   Naipaul was born in Trinidad in 1932 into a large, noisy Indian
family started by grandfathers who came to the island as indentured
servants. From earliest childhood, he wanted out. Everything about
Trinidad and Indian family life made his skin crawl. At 18, he won an
Oxford scholarship and went off to England, never again to live on
the island. In England--now a man without a country--he suffered an
unspeakable panic and loneliness that sent him into a near clinical
depression. But he came out of it, got his degree, went up to London,
got a job at the BBC and within five years began writing the Trinidad
novels that readers of English everywhere quickly recognized as the
work of a genuine literary talent. Then, at 32 , he went to India, to
discover the country of his "roots." What he saw shocked and repelled
him. The repulsion turned to rage. Out of the rage he wrote an
exciting and vituperous book called "An Area of Darkness."</TE>
<TE>   For the next 25 years Naipaul would repeat this experience. He
traveled the Third World (India, Africa, the Caribbean and the Arab
East), writing brilliant journalism out of the sparking anger that
had been put on hold during the breakdown years in England, turning
some of it into even more brilliant fiction: the piece about Michael
X and Black Power in Trinidad became the novel "Guerrillas," the one
about Mobutu Sese Seko and the Congo "A Bend in the River." He had
found his subject. Now, he had to teach himself how to serve it.</TE>
<TE>   It was in India that Naipaul had realized that he didn't fit in
anywhere, that he never had, never would. It had been an illusion to
think he could make himself into an emigre English novelist. His
mind, he realized, was his only home. He must occupy it. To go on
looking hard at the kind of place he had come from--to see things as
they are, in the here and now, without blinders or sentiment--was the
rock on which he would build his church.</TE>
<TE>   Refusing to put a good face on things became Naipaul's article of
faith. The places where everything and everyone within living memory
had been subjected to Empire, where no one had ever belonged,
especially not the natives, these were countries, he came to believe,
that were overwhelmed with the task of making modern society and thus
were hopelessly disposed to lassitude, terror and an overriding
self-deception. Everywhere he went, he experienced--and didn't
hesitate to say he experienced--intellectual deficiency and moral
blindness masquerading as an assertion of "authenticity." He despised
the Africanization of Africa, the spirituality of India, black power
in the Caribbean and the social illness of political Islam. He
thought it all the mark of a fatal self-division within cultures that
now had vast need of a compensating single-mindedness if they were to
go forward. He was, he felt, watching "people who are really
ill-equipped for the twentieth century, light years away from making
the tools they've grown to like." And for this he had no pity.</TE>
<TE>   In a 1981 interview, Naipaul, speaking of the breakdown he had
suffered 30 years before, revealed that he had seen a doctor about
it, that everything the doctor had said was true, and that he
(Naipaul) had hated him for saying it and stopped seeing him. "I
cured myself. It took me two years. Intellect and will, intellect and
will. And the only thing that gave me solace ... was the intricacy of
language. I lost myself in my studies of the derivations of words."</TE>
<TE>   This is exactly what he expects of the Third World: that it will
"cure" itself, not through some long, harrowing process of
self-understanding, but by an act of will that simply pushes back the
hysteria of magic and myth, employing the kind of disciplined mental
work it takes to create a society ruled by reason and historical
analysis.</TE>
<TE>   The collection of essays we now have in hand is made up of travel
pieces written over the last 40 years: more than 500 unremitting
pages of Naipaul casting his famously cold eye on a huge cut of the
world. Actually, the coldness is overrated; there is warmth beneath
it: the dangerous warmth of emotional identification. We are in the
presence of a writer aroused by the sight of people who look just
like himself struggling to make themselves human--and failing,
failing, failing. From this perspective his intelligence cannot be
diverted. And because his intelligence is his genius, to watch
Naipaul think about what he is looking at (no matter what the vantage
point) is to learn how exceptional writing is done. The rage is the
drive, the mind is the talent, but the sentences he taught himself to
write, they are the magic.</TE>
<TE>   Very few writers as gifted as Naipaul have given themselves so
fully to nonfiction writing. He brings to the genre an extraordinary
capacity for making art out of lucid thought: The human application
he prizes above all else. He is a writer for whom language is the
enemy: He despises beautiful writing as much as he does mysticism.
Also, his idea of narrative has little or nothing to do with plot or
character. Observe hard, he says, think even harder, figure out what
you are thinking in the simplest, clearest language, and you will
arrive at narrative. So Naipaul looks hard, thinks even harder, then
of course darts to an unexpected place in the psyche where a flash of
intuitive insight allows him to make narrative, very often the way
the poet, rather than the essayist, does. Among hundreds of
instances, here's one perfect illustration:</TE>
<TE>   In a piece on India, Naipaul is telling us that the religious
rites of Hinduism belong to the ancient world, that the holy cow is
absurd, as are the caste marks and the turbans. Then he writes,
"[They speak] of a people grown barbarous, indifferent and
self-wounding, who, out of a shallow perception of the world, have no
sense of tragedy." No sense of tragedy. W.H. Auden could have written
that. Suddenly, in a single phrase, the reader is gripped by the
meaning of cultural arrest: the way it acts like a narcotic, drains
off urgency, substitutes ceremony for experience.</TE>
<TE>   Yet, to read Naipaul steadily is to feel something of the dilemma
of attraction without love. Five hundred pages of strong and original
writing applied to a social critique that uniformly withholds
sympathy leaves the reader both excited and unsatisfied. First, there
is the taste of pleasure, then the taste of ashes. It's not that the
experience cancels itself out (certainly not), but it is reduced, it
is reduced.</TE>
<TE>   The fullest indictment in this collection is reserved for
Argentina, a country to which Naipaul returned four times between
1972 and 1992, and of which, for nearly a hundred pages, he has
this--and this alone--to say:</TE>
<TE>   "Politics reflect a society and a land. Argentina is a land of
plunder ... and its politics can be nothing but the politics of
plunder ....[A]n artificial, fragmented, colonial society, made
deficient and bogus by its myths .... The failure of Argentina, so
rich, so underpopulated, twenty three million people in a million
square miles, is one of the mysteries of our time .... But ... the
politics of a country can only be an extension of its idea of human
relationships ....[The idea of work done honestly, in order to find
oneself in the work] was the opposite of the idea behind the first
Spanish conquest. [In Argentina, it remains] the missing moral idea."</TE>
<TE>   Nowhere in this piece--not among all the scenes revisited, or the
history related, or people evoked (including Jorge Luis Borges)--do
we feel ourselves in the presence of fully recognizable human beings.
Nowhere do we experience the wit of local idiom, the eloquence of
melancholia, the sorrow of sexual passion or the devastation of
intellectual impotence. No one in Argentina, it seems, suffers or
laughs or hungers or regrets as we do. Not a single Argentine sees
what Naipaul sees. In short, there is nothing in "Argentina and the
Ghost of Eva Peron, 1972-1991" to remind the reader that human beings
and the worlds they make and occupy are painfully mixed--even though
it is always the mixture that makes us feel the life within
ourselves: which is, after all, why we read.</TE>
<TE>   Yet, I can no longer imagine the world without Naipaul's writing.
I can easily, for instance, see it without more of Philip Roth, Saul
Bellow or John Updike. But not Naipaul. It's interesting to realize
that the Americans have been writing for the same 50 years as he,
have also broken literary ground and also distilled neurotic
discontent into a signature brilliance. But now their discontent is
solipsistic, while his is not; theirs the grief of men simply
dissatisfied with their own lives, while Naipaul's continues to drain
out of a sickening meanness of political history that keeps his own
pathologies attached to a way of thinking about the world that will
compel our attention throughout his working life and well beyond.</TE>

<DH>THE GREAT 401(k) HOAX: Why Your Family's Financial Security
Is at Risk, and What You Can Do About It, By William Wolman and Anne
Colamosca, Perseus: 246 pp., $26/  RETIREMENT INSECURITY: The Income
Shortfalls Awaiting the Soon-to-Retire, By Edward N. Wolff, Economic
Policy Institute: 96 pp., $10.95</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PETER G. GOSSELIN</AU>
<BD>Peter G. Gosselin is a national economics correspondent
for The Times in Washington, D.C.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Any journalist who has covered the U.S. economy during the past two
decades has met the type: the ex-steel worker in scrub whites
retraining as a nurse's aide; the laid-off marketing manager who
walks around with a briefcase that turns out to be empty: people who
thought they had an unshakable grip on the good life only to be
tossed over by economic forces beyond their control or even
understanding.</LD>
<LD>   By now, much of the middle class--everyone earning from, say,
$53,000 (the median family income in 2000) to $165,000 (the threshold
for the top 5% of wage earners)--is scrambling to avoid a similar
fate. As plunging stocks punch holes in their retirement savings and
debt-ridden employers chisel away at their health benefits, more and
more Americans are realizing they will have to work longer, save more
and scale back on a standard of living that once seemed assured.
Republicans fear that the resulting outrage could cost them control
of the House in the fall elections and might even jeopardize their
hold on the White House.</LD>
<TE>   But how likely is it that the setbacks of average Americans will
result in political change? What are the chances of a middle-class
populism? On the evidence of these books, at least, the answer is
slim. William Wolman, a former editor and chief economist of Business
Week magazine, his wife, Anne Colamosca, and New York University
economist Edward N. Wolff are superbly qualified to make the case for
fundamental change. They have delved deeply into the numbers that
measure the economic prospects of working Americans. They have proven
immune to the cant that passed for economic insight over the last
decade. They had the courage to attack Corporate America well in
advance of the recent accounting scandals, gross displays of
executive greed and gigantic bankruptcies that have made it an easy
mark. (Both books were finished before the full dimensions of
business' current troubles became apparent.)</TE>
<TE>   Wolman and Colamosca's book, "The Great 401(k) Hoax," in
particular, aspires to go beyond the pension and retirement issues of
its title and delivers a grand critique of American culture at the
turn of the millennium. It includes, among other things, an extended
discussion of the literature of the Gatsby '20s and the Bobo '90s.
The problem is that the U.S. economy is too big, and the nation's
economic actors too varied, to offer easy targets.</TE>
<TE>   That is most vividly demonstrated by Wolff's "Retirement
Insecurity," on which Wolman and Colamosca rely. Wolff set out to
prove that--contrary to conventional wisdom--the economic booms of
the 1980s and 1990s and the great bull market of the last decade
failed the very people who came to depend on them the
most--middle-aged workers saving for retirement. If his key findings
held up under scrutiny, they might have provided the smoking gun
needed to convince Americans it is time to drop their infatuation
with unfettered markets and begin demanding the kind of government
protections that have been eroding since the Reagan era. But they
don't. (More on this later.)</TE>
<TE>   Even with these deficiencies, however, the two books perform an
important service. They remind us of how much we had riding on the
boom times of the 1990s. And they show how unlikely it is that our
great gamble for security and wealth will pay off in anything like
the fashion we had hoped.</TE>
<TE>   "The occasions are rare. But there are times when an ugly
combination of letters and numbers penetrates deeply into the
American consciousness," write Wolman and Colamosca. "There was a
time when '4F' was one of the best-known expressions in the American
language, connoting a young man who became exempt from the military
draft because he had flunked the physical. 'Catch-22,' the title of a
book by Joseph Heller about a military snafu in the war against
Japan, became famous as a description of a problem with no solution.</TE>
<TE>   "A similar fate awaits the combination that defined the hopes and
dreams of American families as they celebrated the booming 1990s and
looked forward to a new, exciting postmillennial decade: 401(k)." The
401(k)is a retirement account in which employees are responsible for
managing their own money, and employers can contribute matching funds
or stock. The accounts were originally intended as supplements to
Social Security and traditional pensions, in which employers manage
the money and guarantee a monthly income to retirees. But as stocks
lifted off in the last years of the 1990s, they provided the
principal means by which the great mass of Americans entered the
market, and they largely replaced pensions.</TE>
<TE>   They became, in the words of Wolman and Colamosca, "a cultural
icon." They seemed to embody "the promise that the average American
family, neither rich nor poor, but middle class, could stake a claim
for its share in the prosperity created by the technological wonders
that energized the American economy in the 1990s."</TE>
<TE>   Two problems didn't surface until the market began cracking in
early 2000. The first was that the risks of coping with tumbling
stock prices, which were borne by employers under the old scheme, had
been shifted to the employees. The second was that the great bull
market of the '90s turned out to be largely a bubble, in which share
prices were driven up by the anticipation of further increases,
rather than by fundamentals, such as a company's ability to make
money.</TE>
<TE>   It is on the subject of stock bubbles that Wolman and Colamosca
are at their depressing best.</TE>
<TE>   The authors compare the '90s with the three previous bubbles of
the 20th century--those ending in 1901, 1929 and 1966--and find that
it was by far the most spectacular, with the wildest disparity
between stock prices and corporate earnings. They look at how the
stock market performed in the aftermath of the previous bubbles and
discover that, in each instance, it took share prices more than two
decades to recover their previous highs.</TE>
<TE>   They show that in the interim, the total, after-inflation return
to stocks was not the 15% to 20% a year investors came to expect in
the '90s nor the 7% a year Wall Street often portrays as the
irreducible minimum equities can deliver, but somewhere between 1.9%
and --0.2% a year.</TE>
<TE>   For the retirement investor, the authors write, the difference
between Wall Street's promise and what history suggests will happen
in the wake of the most recent bubble "is the difference between
comfort and virtual penury."</TE>
<TE>   Where Wolman and Colamosca are at their weakest is in explaining
what caused the '90s bubble and what Americans should do now that it
has popped.</TE>
<TE>   They engage in some overheated rhetoric about the "Wall Street
claque" and bought-and-paid-for politicians. They hint of conspiracy
in arguing that the Lewinsky scandal left Bill Clinton helpless to
resist the entreaties of the financial industry to keep the party
going. They boldly declare that "protests are fated to become an
important part of the post-millennium era." As for what individuals
should do, their answer, in a nutshell, is: Buy bonds. It's hard to
think of a more apt image of the difficulties facing a middle-class
populism than that of bond-buying protesters.</TE>
<TE>   For his part, Wolff reaches the startling conclusion that despite
the longest period of economic prosperity in American history, most
older workers ended the 1990s financially less prepared to retire
than when the growth began. But his explanation of what caused the
decline does not square with his own statistics. Wolff charges that
the advent of personal retirement accounts "has produced greater
inequality between rich and median households and declining
retirement wealth for the typical household." But two dozen pages
later, he concedes that the spread of 401(k)s and their growth in
value has more than compensated for a steep decline in the other
major sources of private retirement savings, pensions and Social
Security. In the end, both books must be treated as way stations on
an uncertain route to a new political era, tracts that knock the
struts out from under the free-market catechism without saying what
should replace it.</TE>
<TE>   To tackle this grander project will require convincing arguments
on at least two counts. The first is that even the "haves" of
middle-class America have a legitimate grievance against an economy
that cannot deliver stable employment, secure retirement and the
opportunity for their children to do better than they. The second is
that Washington has managed to get a few big things right in the
past--take Social Security (which is in better financial shape than
critics claim), civil rights and World War II--and is likely to be
able to do so in the future.</TE>
<TE>   The middle class, placards in hand, awaits its call to arms as the
market falls further.</TE>

<HD>The Piano Man</HD>
<DH>MUSIC OF A LIFE: A Novel, By Andrei Makine, Translated from
the French by Geoffrey Strachan, Arcade Publishing: 110 pp., $19.95</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PETER GREEN</AU>
<BD>Peter Green is the former fiction critic of the London
Daily Telegraph.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Reading novels, good or bad, about the grimy puritanism and murderous
paranoia of the Stalinist era in Soviet Russia is rather like being
stuck at a party with a man who insists on giving you a blow-by-blow
account of his wife's losing battle with cancer while confined in a
mental hospital. You feel natural sympathy, but you wish to God you
were anywhere else. As the writer Compton Mackenzie remarked, when
asked, toward the end of World War I, if he'd seen D.H. Lawrence's
"Look! We Have Come Through!," a cycle of love poems addressing the
wartime tribulations of Lawrence and his wife Frieda: "I'm very glad
they've come through, but I don't see why I should have to look."</LD>
<LD>   Worse, because of the need for subtle indirection on the part of
anti-Stalinist Soviet authors under Soviet censorship (what George
Orwell labeled doublethink, and Czeslaw Milosz Ketmanism), a
tradition of symbolism and allegory developed in Russian fiction that
persisted long after the firing squads and gulags that had
necessitated it were (in theory at least) done away with. On top of
this, the Western habit, generated by the Cold War, of wildly
overpraising any Russian literature attacking the Stalinist regime is
likewise still alive and well, at a time when the fall of the Berlin
Wall is ancient history and a young generation is beginning to ask,
who was this guy Yeltsin anyway?</LD>
<TE>   Andrei Makine immigrated to France from the USSR in 1987, at the
age of 30, a year or two before the final collapse of Soviet
communism. In a characteristically symbolic gesture of rejection, he
writes all his works in French. "Music of a Life" deals with the
Great Terror of the late 1930s, the gray misery and poverty of Soviet
society (the kind of thing that earned the USSR the reputation of
being the only Third World country with a first-strike capacity) and
the brutal suppression of artistic individualism. Just to brighten
things up, he starts his narrative in April 1941, so that we get a
gut-wrenching slice of the German invasion, complete with
corpse-littered battlefields.</TE>
<TE>   "Music of a Life" is packed with allegory, involving, among other
things, trains and trainstation waiting rooms as a paradigm of the
dire condition of Homo sovieticus. It has also been praised to the
skies by French critics: The newspaper Le Figaro asserts that "Makine
is without doubt the greatest living writer." It is a tribute to his
literary skill, and to the unobtrusive sensitivity of his translator,
Geoffrey Strachan, that despite all these strikes against him, Makine
succeeds as well as he does. The greatest living writer he isn't. His
narrative bristles with improbabilities, his characterization is at
times simpliste almost to the point of caricature, but he does have a
remarkable ability for evoking (mostly depressing) moods and scenes;
his entire novel is steeped in an atmosphere of dulled fear and
hopeless resignation.</TE>
<TE>   His hero, Alexei Berg (probably Jewish, though this isn't
stressed), is a young pianist about to give his first concert in the
spring of 1941. His parents are privileged (they own a large car),
but two days before the concert he comes home to find them being
arrested. He panics, takes the car and flees: first to his professor,
who (he sees just in time) is about to turn him in; then to an aunt
in the Urals, where the war catches up with them. For reasons
unclear, he steals the clothes and identity of a dead soldier,
shopping around the battlefield for a near-match (one of the most
powerful scenes in the book), serves two years at the front and ends
up as a general's driver.</TE>
<TE>   Back in Moscow he is taken up by the general's teenage daughter,
who--block that irony--wants to teach this simple soldier the piano.
His identity revealed (he can't help playing well), he's packed off
to a gulag for 10 years and to a Siberian labor camp for several
more. He tells his story to an anonymous narrator on a train--where
else? We leave him as a prematurely old man in Moscow, drifting
around on no visible means of support and attending--more irony--a
young pianist's debut concert. Against all odds, this disjunctive
tale of a ruined life held me from start to finish. But I still don't
see why I should have to look.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   (BEGIN TEXT OF INFOBOX)</TE>
<TE>   From `Music of a Life'</TE>
<TE>   It took him two days to find his man, his identity donor. His
searches in the village devastated by fire had been fruitless. He had
come upon several survivors and had to make himself scarce. On the
road he found mainly the bodies of women and children or of men who
were too old.</TE>
<TE>   At the end of his second day of walking, he went down toward a
river, and on the bank, at the entrance to a bridge demolished by
shelling, saw a complete battlefield: dozens of soldiers to whom
death had lent poses that were sometimes extremely banal, like the
one of a body with its legs buckled beneath it, sometimes touching,
like that of a young infantryman, his hand outstretched in an
orator's gesture. Hiding in the undergrowth, Alexei waited, listening
intently, but could hear no moaning. The evening was still light; the
faces of the dead, when he finally dared to approach them, were
exposed in defenseless simplicity ...</TE>
<TE>   Far away from the others, his head washed by the current of the
stream, lay a soldier. The one he had been looking for. Alexei began
to strip him ...</TE>

<DH>A SHORT HISTORY OF THE SHADOW, By Charles Wright Farrar,
Straus &amp; Giroux: 82 pp., $20</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LANGDON HAMMER</AU>
<BD>Langdon Hammer is the author of "Hart Crane and Allen
Tate: Janus-Faced Modernism" and the co-editor of "O My Land, My
Friends: The Selected Letters of Hart Crane." He is a professor of
English at Yale University.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"I sit where I always sit," Charles Wright declares in the first line
of the first poem in his book, "A Short History of the Shadow." He
repeats the phrase in the next poem and again in the one after that.
But he is sitting somewhere new each time, and what he sees--how he
addresses and invests the world around him--alters with each vantage
point. Wright's idea is that, because the world is in motion, the
self is too. So when we hold still and attend to the world in its
slow changes, we are journeying and changing too.</LD>
<LD>   There is a polemical edge to Wright's insistence on sitting where
he sits, a determination to go on writing the kind of poem he writes.
Over a long career he has perfected a particular kind of meditative
lyric and an instantly identifiable style. In a sense, that style is
the poem, its recurrent drama or story, which is always about what it
enacts: the poet's search for words adequate to the world unfolding
before him, day by day. Adequate, that is, to describe the world in
its sensual particulars and metaphysical implications: not just the
weather, but what it says about the state of our souls. Wright loves
the world, but he is impatient to get beyond it. And we feel both
impulses in his lavish, restless style.</LD>
<TE>   "A Short History of the Shadow" is his first book since "Negative
Blue: Selected Later Poems" (2000), the much-praised gathering of his
work from the 1990s and the third in a series of volumes of selected
poems that includes "Country Music: Selected Early Poems" (1982) and
"The World of the Ten Thousand Things: Poems 1980-1990" (1990). These
summary volumes organize Wright's lyric poems in larger structures
that suggest chapters in a single ongoing work, a grand personal
testament and spiritual log.</TE>
<TE>   Embarking now on a new cycle of poems, Wright asks, "where to
begin again?" One can almost hear the skeptical internal voice that
is needling him: But how will you avoid repeating yourself? Won't you
run out of fresh ways of seeing?</TE>
<TE>   Wright responds by returning to his starting places. These include
actual landscapes, such as the Tennessee hills where he grew up in
the 1940s and the Italian towns where, as an enlisted man in the
1950s, he discovered Ezra Pound's poetry and wrote his first poems.
They also include his early poetic ambitions and assumptions:</TE>
<TE>   I used to think the power of words was inexhaustible,</TE>
<TE>   That how we said the world</TE>
<TE>   was how it was, and how it would be ....</TE>
<TE>   That words were the Word,</TE>
<TE>   That language could lead us inexplicably to grace,</TE>
<TE>   As though it were geographical.</TE>
<TE>   I used to think these things when I was young.</TE>
<TE>   I still do.</TE>
<TE>   A little later in the same poem, the mood changes. Now the bravura
is gone, "the power of words" seems exhausted, and Wright's faith is
tested:</TE>
<TE>   Insubstantial as smoke, our words</TE>
<TE>   Drum down like fingertips across the page,</TE>
<TE>   leaving no smudge or mark. . . .</TE>
<TE>   This word, that word, all fall down.</TE>
<TE>   How far from heaven the stars are,</TE>
<TE>   how far the heart from the page.</TE>
<TE>   Wright moves back and forth between these different feelings about
language and its power. There are passages here of the virtuosic
writing he has become known for, with wild mixings of slang and high
diction ("thus mojo, thus misericordia") and brilliant, witty
conceits ("Winter blue moon, light like a wax-thin slice of
finocchio"). This is the masterful language of a poet who can make us
feel that what he says about the world is how it is. But just as
often he evokes an alien landscape, resistant to our impositions of
meaning. Walt Whitman saw the grass as "The beautiful uncut hair of
graves." Wright movingly reworks the image:</TE>
<TE>   The seasons don't care for us. For them,</TE>
<TE>   transcendence is merely</TE>
<TE>   raiment,</TE>
<TE>   And never a second thought.</TE>
<TE>   Poor us, they think, poor us in our marly shoes,</TE>
<TE>   poor us in our grass</TE>
<TE>   hair.</TE>
<TE>   Following the course of the uncaring seasons, this book traces two
complete annual cycles, from March in the first poem to April in the
last, as if it took that much writing and living to get to spring
(and the fresh start Wright seeks). As a model for this journey,
Wright points to Dante in "A Short History of the Shadow," the title
poem placed midway in the book and set at the start of winter. "Only
Dante, in Purgatory, casts a shadow," he explains, "L'ombra della
carne, the shadow of flesh-- / everyone else is one." The book as a
whole moves through a shadowland that is Wright's contemporary
purgatory:</TE>
<TE>   This is the way the world looks</TE>
<TE>   In late November,</TE>
<TE>   no leaves on the trees, no ledge to</TE>
<TE>   foil the lightfall.</TE>
<TE>   Yet even in this state of depleted images, we feel "the power of
words" revive in those cadenced repetitions ("no leaves ... no
ledge") and that marvelous, mirroring alliteration: "to foil the
lightfall."</TE>
<TE>   Here and elsewhere, part of the power of Wright's words depends on
a distinctive prosody. Every poem in this book is organized either in
stanzas with a uniform number of lines (usually three-, four-, or
five-line groups) or in sonnets with a break between octave and
sestet. One seldom sees these patterns, however, because Wright's
stanzas are broken up on the page by his frequent use of the dropped
line, his trademark device. It consists of a line broken in two
parts, usually unequal in length, one of which continues on the next
line, not as a new line itself (the first letter is uncapitalized),
but as an extension of the prior one, as if on a new level. The
device allows into the line some of the enigmatic white space
bordering the poem. Visually it gives an impression of language
flowing over and around unseen rocks.</TE>
<TE>   The break in the dropped line is a formal version of the break
Wright is always looking for in the landscapes he describes, what,
looking to the nighttime horizon, he calls "the crack, the tiny
crack, / In the east that separates one world from the next .... "</TE>
<TE>   Even in this ascetic book that is focused on gathering shadows and
dwindling time, Wright's poems are so sensually rich and gratifying,
he may seem satisfied with what he sees, too comfortable in this
world to think hard about the next. He anticipates this reaction to
his work in the poem "Why, It's as Pretty as a Picture" in which he
calls himself a "shallow thinker." He means that he is trying to
render the surface of experience, its texture and feel, not its
deeper logic, because, in the absence of an "overwhelming design," a
master plot we might all believe in, that's all that we have to go
on: only a "postcard," the sum of appearances.</TE>
<TE>   But Wright is at heart a mystic, not an aesthete. He isn't
satisfied with a pretty picture. He knows there is a landscape behind
this one, and the poem ends by evoking it:</TE>
<TE>   The postcard's just how we see it, and not how it is.</TE>
<TE>   Behind the eye's the other eye,</TE>
<TE>   and the other ear.</TE>
<TE>   The moonlight whispers in it, the mountains imprint upon it,</TE>
<TE>   Our eyelids close over it,</TE>
<TE>   Dawn and the sunset radiate from it like Eden.</TE>
<TE>   Not how we see it, but how it is. That's the goal of these poems,
as of all of Wright's work. Yet our only access to that "it"--to the
being beyond appearances, what Wright calls Eden, the source of all
things--comes in how we see it, day by day, poem after poem, year
after year. Because our access is incomplete and metaphorical,
dependent on words and their inconstant power, it always needs to be
renewed.</TE>
<TE>   Wright insists that this renewal of vision justifies the moral and
aesthetic risks it entails (risks of repetition, complacence and
fatigue). The poems in "A Short History of the Shadow" prove again
that it does.</TE>

<DH>STANDING IN THE RAINBOW: A Novel, By Fannie Flagg, Random
House: 400 pp. $24.95</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MICHAEL HARRIS</AU>
<BD>Michael Harris is a regular contributor to Book Review.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Tuck in your napkins, because Fannie Flagg has served us up another
big, juicy Middle American apple pie of a book, sometimes tart but
mostly sweet.</LD>
<LD>   Fans of Flagg's "Fried Green Tomatoes at the Whistle Stop Cafe"
and "Welcome to the World, Baby Girl!" are going to enjoy this one
too.</LD>
<LD>   "Standing in the Rainbow" covers the period from 1946 to the
millennium. Its vantage point is Elmwood Springs, Mo., with its
one-block downtown and surrounding farms, woods and swimming holes.
The first half of the novel focuses on the Smith family--easygoing
pharmacist Doc and his wife, Dorothy (whose "Neighbor Dorothy" radio
show, broadcast from her living room via a backyard transmission
tower, is a lifeline for rural women in five states), their pretty
daughter, Anna Lee, and their rambunctious 10-year-old son, Bobby.</LD>
<TE>   Theirs is a world of senior proms and bubble-gum-blowing contests,
of eccentric but well-meaning relatives, of romance that mostly runs
smooth and childhoods that segue neatly into responsible adulthood.
It's a world that admits tragedy (an earlier Smith child died) and
deprivation (the Smiths' boarder, short-order cook Jimmy Head, lost a
leg in World War II and never will find love), but even its dark side
is sugar-coated.</TE>
<TE>   In this sense, Flagg's fiction deviates from the tradition it
draws on, which began with Mark Twain and Booth Tarkington and
includes such recent novels as Thomas Berger's "The Feud" and
Garrison Keillor's "Lake Wobegon Days." All of these authors feign a
naive voice to deliver sophisticated insights. They satirize an
insular, self-satisfied culture that, on another level, they
sympathize with. The tension between satire and sympathy is what
gives their stories bite.</TE>
<TE>   Flagg, on the other hand, is an out-and-out sympathizer. The
satire in "Standing in the Rainbow" is a diversion, meant not to
question or diminish Missourians but to make them more lovable.
Flagg's aim, in fact, is to defend white Middle America from the
coastal elites that would dismiss it as fly-over territory and its
people as rubes. Like country-born TV star Dena Nordstrom in "Baby
Girl," characters in this novel prove able to compete with anyone.</TE>
<TE>   Foremost among them is Hamm Sparks, a tractor salesman who rises
to become governor of Missouri on nothing more than energy, nerve,
native shrewdness and a belief that the state's little people need a
champion. Pushy, ambitious people such as Sparks often fare poorly at
the hands of novelists, and it's one of Flagg's charms that she shows
his admirable side, just as she reminds us of small towns' forgotten
virtues.</TE>
<TE>   During World War II, for instance, soldiers on troop trains
passing through Elmwood Springs, "scared young boys trying to be
brave ... wrote their names and addresses on pieces of paper and
threw them out the train windows, hoping to get some girl to write to
them. At the end of the war Elmwood Springs prided itself on the fact
that not one boy ... had ever gone without an answer." But it's one
thing to demand respect for heartland folks and their beliefs,
something else to insist that those beliefs should be the measure of
all things. It's a fine line, and Flagg sometimes crosses it.</TE>
<TE>   As the Smiths age and grow less interesting, Sparks takes over the
second half of the novel. He marries Betty Raye Oatman, a shy girl
who has stayed with the Smiths after tiring of her frenetic life on
the road with the Oatman Family Gospel Singers. With Sparks, though,
she's back in the unwanted limelight as he battles state Democratic
Party bosses, has an affair with glamorous Kansas City arts maven
Vita Green, runs for president in 1968 and mysteriously vanishes.</TE>
<TE>   Sparks gives a speech at UC Berkeley at the height of the
anti-Vietnam War protests. He is treated shabbily, to be sure--pelted
with fruit and shouted down as faculty members look on, smirking. But
there is no acknowledgment that the student protesters might have a
point, or that they are anything more than "loonies" or "pig
ignorant." Or traitors.</TE>
<TE>   Sparks' speech, which we are supposed to admire, is warmed-over
George Wallace--without the racism, but otherwise word-perfect in its
appeals to Silent Majority resentment of "subversive ideas,"
"pea-headed, lily-livered college professors" and "mama's boys who
let the others do the fighting for them," all of which are blamed for
making "bright and shining true-blue America ... begin to tarnish,
tear and fall apart at the seams."</TE>

<HD>Down These Mean Streets</HD>
<DH>A RAINBOW OF GANGS: Street Cultures in the Mega-City, By
James Diego Vigil, University of Texas Press: 224 pp., $40 cloth,
$17.95 paper</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TOM HAYDEN</AU>
<BD>Tom Hayden chaired a state Senate task force on gang
violence prevention. He teaches a course on gangs at Occidental
College and is writing a book on the subject.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Ten thousand deaths, nearly all African American and Latino young
men, is the body count of Los Angeles gang violence in the last two
decades, but when was the last time anyone read a headline declaring,
"Death Toll in Gang Conflicts Reaches 10,000, Government Proposes
Peace Strategy"? Given the silence and disregard concerning these
casualties, it is hard to avoid the conclusion that gang deaths are
deemed lesser deaths than law-abiding ones. Some people even shrug
them off as deserved.</LD>
<LD>   But what if any were preventable? That's the question that haunts
the reader of James Diego Vigil's "A Rainbow of Gangs." Vigil, a
professor of social ecology at UC Irvine, weaves personal stories
with historical analysis to show the commonality of Mexican, African
American, Salvadoran and Vietnamese gangs despite their ethnic
differences.</LD>
<LD>   Vigil describes how gang members, far from being devils incarnate,
are produced by the experience of what he calls "multiple
marginality." They are from the poorest of the poor, relegated to the
fringes of society beyond the usual controls of family, school and
police. They are socialized on the streets.</LD>
<TE>   Vigil first suggested the thesis of multiple marginality in his
1988 book "Barrio Gangs"; here, after hundreds of interviews, he
demonstrates how the process crosses ethnic lines. It is a useful
analytic approach suggesting that solutions lie in bringing the
marginalized into the mainstream to repair the breakdowns, not in
further marginalizing the youth who bear the wounds.</TE>
<TE>   Vigil first tells us of Puppet, born in 1973 at L.A. County-USC
Hospital, to former gang members and drug addicts. His hard life was
improving until one of the many foster families he lived with left
him behind. Gang life instilled in Puppet the feelings of love and
power that he lacked. Today he works as a construction laborer, has
matured out of the gang and has a girlfriend and a 1-year-old son.</TE>
<TE>   There is Mookie, born in Texas in 1966, whose parents worked long
hours at jobs that left little time for raising him. He wound up in a
group home and couldn't handle work as a parking lot attendant or a
high-rise window washer. He finally became a neighborhood Crip, then
was implicated--wrongly, he says--in a drug-related shooting. He is
spending life in prison writing rap lyrics: "As time went on I grew
more mature / Sometimes I noticed the problem but never had the
cure."</TE>
<TE>   There's Huc, born the same year as Puppet in South Vietnam. As a
boat person, he clung to a floating board while watching his pregnant
mother, siblings and aunt drown when he was 6. He joined a gang in
Los Angeles when school conflicts taught him "you couldn't hang by
yourself." When some Chicano kids at school tried to "mad-dog and
race-talk" him, he shot at them and missed. Later he served three
years in prison for robbery. His anger, he tells us, is quite simple:
"I lost my whole family for me to come over here."</TE>
<TE>   Finally, there is Arturo, born with a life-threatening heart
condition in wartime El Salvador, where people died and disappeared
all around him, including his father. He was smuggled to L.A. for
surgery at Childrens Hospital when he was 7. His mother cleaned
Westside homes 14 hours a day. When bused to suburban schools, he
started fights to get respect and win the best seats in the
cafeteria. His uncle, a veterano in the street gang Mara Salvatrucha,
made him finally feel safe, so he joined. "It just seemed like
somebody was always leaving me."</TE>
<TE>   What connects these four young men is a deficit of love. The
stories Vigil recounts are full of punishment and pain, and when
society finally stepped into the vacuum, it was more of the same.
These youth are modern untouchables; they are refugees, war victims,
descendants of slaves. The schools they attend are dropout factories.
The police suppress them. "The greater the economic gap between
winners and losers [under the capitalist ethic]," Vigil writes, "the
more structurally embedded the marginalization of large segments of
the population becomes."</TE>
<TE>   Vigil humanizes instead of demonizes. For those who still wonder
why they should care, Vigil offers numbers. It is estimated that
there are 200,000 gang members in the Los Angeles area. In addition,
240,000 young people were hauled into Juvenile Court last year in the
county. Two-thirds of the 225,000 inmates in jails and state prisons
in 1999 were alleged to be gang members. Most are rearrested within
three years of release, and there are hundreds of thousands more in
the ranks of the at-risk population. Costs for hospitalizing the
victims of gang violence run as high as $1 billion a year in county
hospitals.</TE>
<TE>   It's a problem that has endured through many decades of quick
fixes and press release politics. As long ago as 1942, during the
Zoot Suit era, a law enforcement official declared that the police
"will take them out of circulation until they realize the authorities
will not tolerate gangsterism." Just this year, a Times editorial
repeated the refrain: "And now seems a good time for the city to
finally stand up to the street gangs that terrorize communities, to
tell them that their slow-motion mass murder must end." Finally?
Aren't 10,000 dead bodies enough punishment to quiet the problem?
Promises to "finally" crush the gang phenomenon with hard-line
policies have failed for decades. We have more draconian penalties
than ever before, and the greatest prison buildup in national
history. Isn't it time someone declared that the war on gangs is a
hopeless quagmire and demanded an alternative? Isn't it time to make
a greater priority of ending the multiple marginalities that alienate
young people of color faster than they can be locked up?</TE>
<TE>   Vigil doesn't go that far, if only because he feels "we are
powerless to address changes at the macro level." But if we are
powerless, the tragic implication is that the war on gangs is a
permanent feature of our society. Vigil's proposals are moderate
ones. Expand Head Start. Back Arnold Schwarzenegger's Summer Games.
Support the sheriff's program for redirecting first-time offenders
from detention to supervision by off-duty deputies. Good programs
each and every one, but none will challenge marginalization.</TE>
<TE>   Vigil recites the three-pronged strategy that is consensus among
gang specialists: prevention for the little kids, intervention for
the preteens and suppression for the 13-to 20-year-olds who engage in
criminal activity. Yet he notes that "the allocation of resources and
level of investment in prevention and intervention are pale in
comparison to those earmarked for suppression efforts." For example,
law enforcement gets the largest share of Los Angeles' $4-billion
municipal budget. Vigil says New York City spends $8,000 per capita
for public school students versus $93,000 a year for each child in
the new juvenile detention center in the South Bronx. Vigil's work
may be viewed skeptically by neo-conservatives like William Bennett,
James Q. Wilson and John DiIulio who have dominated discourse with
calls for harsher punishment of those they call "brutally remorseless
super-predators" and for the political isolation of any liberals who
are "soft on crime." Fighting gangs is good politics, to no one's
surprise, but it is not a solution.</TE>
<TE>   These hard-liners seem to think that better morals and free
markets will cure the 38% and 44% poverty rates among Latino and
African American children. Even many gang researchers have hardened
with the times. The current dean of the field, Malcolm Klein,
director of the USC Social Science Institute, attacks Father Gregory
Boyle, whose work for peace in the barrio is widely respected, as a
misguided saint who only solidifies gang cohesion by giving homeboys
too much attention.</TE>
<TE>   Vigil's stance is, instead, reminiscent of Jacob Riis, the great
chronicler and photographer of how "The Other Half" lived in the New
York slums at the turn of the last century. Riis wrote of the Irish,
Italian and Jewish gangs that "the gang is a distemper of the slums;
a friend come to tell us something is amiss in our social life." Riis
was followed by the University of Chicago's Frederick Thrasher, who
wrote in 1927 that gang subcultures arose in the cracks, or
"interstices," of urban neglect combined with the inner cracks of
identity that occur in the turbulent years of adolescence. Captured
by the mystique of the melting pot, most people today fantasize that
the white ethnic street corner boys of yesteryear simply pulled
themselves up by their own bootstraps. But the larger truth is that
those millions of Irish, Italian and Jewish homeboys rose into the
middle classes through unions, political parties and the New Deal.
Now instead of recognizing with Riis that something is "amiss in our
social life," many of their descendants seem to enjoy a good,
nostalgic episode of "The Sopranos" before voting for anti-immigrant
law-and-order politicians.</TE>
<TE>   Vigil's book is important because it comes at a time when we
arerethinking our strategies about the war on gangs. This year even
some of the war's architects are moderating their views. DiIulio has
regretted and retracted his rhetoric about "super-predators" as
exaggerated. The man known in national police circles as the
"godfather" of gang investigators, L.A. County Sheriff's Deputy Wes
McBride, struck a tone of unusual compassion at his retirement this
spring, saying that "gang members are part of a community and should
be approached as human beings, above all else." He added: "We don't
solve the social conditions as a nation that tends to create gangs,
we don't solve illiteracy or poverty."</TE>
<TE>   Highly respected writer Luis J. Rodriguez, a former hard-core gang
member, has called for an urban peace movement that includes gang
members, ex-gang members, clergy and people of conscience. A team of
innovative researchers at New York's John Jay College of Criminal
Justice has broken the academic mold by organizing global conferences
on the potential of street organizations to transform themselves into
self-help and empowerment groups. And in an unprecedented decision, a
federal immigration judge this month granted political asylum to
ex-gang member Alex Sanchez so he can continue his peace work with
Homies Unidos in the Pico Union barrio. Sanchez, a Salvadoran, was
arrested by the LAPD and threatened with deportation; police were
suspicious that an ex-gang member could convert to peaceful ways.</TE>
<TE>   This month is the 10th anniversary of the gang truce in Watts
after the riots of 1992. The truce decreased homicides sharply for a
time and still continues to be observed as a standard of behavior by
many who might otherwise be killing one another. But the head of the
LAPD's South Bureau, Deputy Chief Matthew Hunt, prophesied accurately
a decade ago, that "I would like to think these [truce] gatherings
will have some long-lasting effect, but if social conditions and
unemployment remain the same, you will have continuing unrest and the
police will have to respond to those situations."</TE>
<TE>   The failure to "rebuild L.A." after the 1992 riots opened a vacuum
for a new generation of young homeboys who never benefited from the
truce since, as Vigil notes, "the pleas of gang members and reformers
for social, recreation, and economic alternatives for street youth
have largely gone unheeded."</TE>
<TE>   After proceeding like snails in implementing the 1992 Christopher
Commission report, the LAPD continued an almost paramilitary and
certainly unconstitutional war on gangs that skidded to an ugly end
in the Rampart scandal.</TE>
<TE>   For those still looking for solutions based on the Christopher
report and the Rampart consent decree, "A Rainbow of Gangs" is a
constructive nonjudgmental guide to the unfinished business of
reducing the menace of too much marginality.</TE>
<TE>   Unless of course this book and its countless warnings go unheeded
as the crises recede from the front page and apathy crawls over us.
Perhaps there is a more sinister scenario to consider: That the
authorities, supported by a silent fearful majority, without
conscious planning or malign intent, have instinctively accepted a
quite different approach, that the price of 10,000 dead bodies every
two decades is far preferable to the discomforts of sharing power and
affluence with those dark-skinned citizens who stand outside the
gates.</TE>

<DH>Adam Parfrey's Feral House isn't for the coy, the squeamish
or the meek</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GARY INDIANA</AU>
<BD>Gary Indiana is the author of several novels, including
"Resentment: A Comedy," "Depraved Indifference" and "Three Month
Fever: The Andrew Cunanan Story."</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As corporate publishing grows ever more corporate, the specialized
work of nonfiction, the photography volume that beckons to a certain
rarefied taste, the historical work that explores, let's say, areas
of less than burning interest to a vast reading public are all less
likely to find support at major houses. Small presses, once bastions
of the sublime and ridiculous fringe interests of readers, are in
many cases being gobbled by the major leagues, becoming wholly owned
subsidiaries answering to that ever-more-draconian Bottom Line.</LD>
<LD>   This is one reason we need publishers like Feral House. Not
everyone wants to read an oral history of the punk scene in 1970s Los
Angeles or the philosophical ruminations of Scotland's Moors Murderer
Ian Brady or to study the bloody photojournalism of Mexican tabloids
or ponder "the bloody rise of the satanic metal underground" in, of
all places, Norway.</LD>
<TE>   Not everybody wants to see corpses with their heads blown off,
murder victims in situ on the sidewalk with their intestines hanging
out, aborted fetuses, hospital patients sporting enormous tumors,
amputated limbs, bloody hammers, knives and other tools of homicide.
Many people do not wish to read the diaries and Post-It notes and
laundry lists of serial killers, death cultists, adolescents sliding
off the deep end or the "reflections" of writers such as Colin
Wilson, who specialize in drooling over other people's misery and
introducing the pensees of incarcerated human waste material as if
revealing the whereabouts of the Holy Grail.</TE>
<TE>   It's a safe bet, I think, that rather few people find such works
more worthy of their time than "The Brothers Karamazov" or "Light in
August" or the works of Henry Adams, Taylor Branch, Alexis de
Tocqueville and other canonical reading matter. But some certainly
do, and one person's esoterica may be another person's velvet gold
mine: Consider what brilliant use W.G. Sebald has made of the history
of silkworm cultivation and the spread of Dutch elm disease, among
many obscure researches, in "The Rings of Saturn" and his other
fiction.</TE>
<TE>   I don't want to push a strictly utilitarian argument in favor of
Feral House's extremely extreme, often necrophiliac and paranoid
array of publications. It does not really matter if a literary genius
one day spins a tissue of ingenious reflections from his or her
perusal of "Sex and Rockets: The Occult World of Jack Parsons," a
Feral House title by John Carter, or "Extreme Islam: Anti-American
Propaganda of Muslim Fundamentalism," a mind-boggling decoupage of
hate manifestos and religiously twisted kitsch assembled by Feral
House editor-in-chief Adam Parfrey.</TE>
<TE>   I remember writer Jamaica Kincaid's once telling me that she was
reading Goethe's theory of color with great relish, even though she
knew that not a word of it was correct. Works of questionable
scholarship or less-than-impeccable accuracy, even works that are
blatantly ghoulish and make no claim to "redeeming social value" can
be, and, let's face it, usually are, fascinating in and of
themselves. (Sartre preferred reading serie noir crime novels to
Merleau-Ponty, and who could blame him?) There are times, too, when a
book of libidinal fancy and sexual-historical lore such as
"Voluptuous Panic: The Erotic World of Weimar Berlin" by Mel Gordon
is a more welcome diversion from life's poisonous little ironies than
"The Brothers Karamazov."</TE>
<TE>   Feral House is not consistently one thing or another. Some of its
offerings--"Snitch Culture" by Jim Redden, "The X-Rated Bible" by Ben
Edward Akerley and "Lexicon Devil: The Fast Times and Short Life of
Darby Crash and the Germs" by Brendan Mullen with Don Bolles and
Parfrey, to name a few recent titles--are richly interesting,
fastidiously researched and arguably important contributions to their
respective subjects.</TE>
<TE>   Some others, such as "Death Scenes: A Homicide Detective's
Scrapbook," despite its lively introduction by classy Katherine Dunn,
author of "Geek Love," are pure pieces of ghoulishness. But if you
want to see what death looks like, Feral House will show it to you.</TE>
<TE>   Feral House brings us gems like "Voluptuous Panic" in the same
breath, so to speak, as such dubious achievements as "The Making of a
Serial Killer" by Gainesville psycho Danny Rolling and his
Vampira-like muse, Sondra London, which recounts several of the
ghastliest rape-and-mutilation killings ever perpetrated in the
U.S.--with the perp himself clearly gasping each blatantly
pornographic paragraph to his amanuensis. Questionable though it may
be to even print such a book, it is No. 2 in Feral House's True Crime
Series.</TE>
<TE>   Yes. Highly questionable and, in this particular instance,
especially insulting to the survivors of Danny Rolling's victims.
Yet, No. 1 in the series, John Gilmore's "Cold-Blooded," is a
legitimate masterpiece of the true crime genre. If we can't have one
without the other, it's undoubtedly better to have both instead of
neither. And neither is what we will have if quirky, brave (and maybe
just a little bent) publishing ventures like Feral House get sucked
up by Multinational Mania.</TE>

<DH>UNMASKING L.A.: Third Worlds and the City, Edited by Deepak

AMERICAN CELEBRATION AND CONFLICT: A History of Ethnic Identity and
Festival in Los Angeles, 1934-1990, By Lon Kurashige, University of
California Press: 274 pp., $45, $18.95 paper</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JONATHAN KIRSCH</AU>
<BD>Jonathan Kirsch, a contributing writer to the Book
Review, is the author of, most recently, "The Woman Who Laughed at
God: The Untold History of the Jewish People."</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As pinned down and laid open on the pages of "Unmasking L.A.: Third
Worlds and the City," the City of Angels may be nearly unrecognizable
to many of the readers who are likely to pick up the book. A "crater
of genocide" is how editor Deepak Narang Sawhney describes the place,
a "dystopian metro-galaxy."</LD>
<LD>   "Unmasking L.A." is the latest addition to the literature of
despair that has attached itself to Los Angeles, a counterweight to
what Sawhney calls "the hype, promotion and spectacle that have
shrouded Los Angeles in a cloud of mythic glory for so long." As seen
by Sawhney and most of his fellow contributors, L.A. is the "urban,
gritty edge of First World greed and Third World resistance," a place
that can be understood only in terms of its own profound dysfunction.</LD>
<TE>   "Upon arrival to the shores of Los Angeles, asylum seekers,
'illegal' recruits, determined actors, fluid nomads, promising
directors, and hopeful immigrants find themselves mesmerized by the
city's seemingly infinite economic and geographical vastness, the
year-round sunshine, the ostentatious wealth seeping out of gated
communities, and the sheer possibility that anything can happen,"
writes Sawhney. "They are simultaneously appalled by the
superficiality of the city, the plasticity of the residents, the
sprawling mess of traffic jams, and the polluted atmosphere of el
pueblo bent on suffocating itself to annihilation."</TE>
<TE>   Sawhney, a fellow at the State University of New York, Binghamton,
has consulted 10 outspoken critics and commentators, ranging from the
strident urban critic Mike Davis ("Ecology of Fear") to the mellow
New Age guru Deepak Chopra, from poet Jimmy Santiago Baca to the
collective of artists and writers called Situationist International,
and he presents their musings on Los Angeles (and much else besides)
in the essays, studies, manifestos, poems, photographs and
conversations that appear in "Unmasking L.A."</TE>
<TE>   Not all of contributors are capable of the high-intensity rhetoric
and white-hot passion that characterize Sawhney's prose, and each one
approaches the target from a different line of attack, but most of
them seem to agree that Los Angeles is a place with a dark past and
an uncertain future. To know the truth about the City of Angels, they
suggest, we need to look at crime, poverty and racial conflict as the
glimmerings of an ugly reality glimpsed behind the pretty myths.</TE>
<TE>   "[T]o understand what goes on in L.A., we must see the flow of
people, information, and disease between the city and the pen,"
insists author and professor Christian Parenti, whose "Satellites of
Sorrow" is a study of California prison culture, "and we must also
examine the specific brutalities of life inside prison." And Paul Von
Blum, a professor of art history and African American studies, who
contributes a survey of "Resistance Art in Los Angeles," asks us to
regard the work of graffiti artists as the use of "guerrilla tactics"
in a struggle against the "prevailing corporate and governmental
dogma." "The fusion of Mexican muralism and hip-hop culture," Von
Blum insists, "has encouraged young people, predominantly of color,
to use public and private walls, alleys, tunnels, and abandoned
buildings to offer serious challenges to the existing social
reality." Only rarely do we come across a note of affirmation or
celebration in "Unmasking L.A.," and even then it is a glimpse only
through the experience of a life on the mean streets. A poem by Baca,
for example, imagines a young woman's hands as "earth swans /
surrendering only to love," swimming through "streams of police
bullets, / lakes of drugs and hypodermic needles" but "unscathed by
drive-bys, by stab wounds, / by violent fights with my boyfriend":</TE>
<TE>   my hands submerge into hearts</TE>
<TE>   and print papers with blue and gold and brown</TE>
<TE>   and I bring them like a schoolgirl</TE>
<TE>   home to show the world</TE>
<TE>   how my hands look on paper</TE>
<TE>   Sawhney is not merely a collector and compiler of other people's
points of view; his voice can be discerned throughout the book, even
literally when he presents the transcriptions of long conversations
with Davis, Chopra and Columbia University humanities professor
Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak. And the dialogues include some very odd
moments for a book that is supposedly about Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   A mostly noncommittal Chopra, for example, refuses to buy into
Sawhney's dialectic: "I do not think in terms of positive or
negative," Chopra insists. "Evolution happens." And, even though
Sawhney announces his intention to reveal "the Third World
geographies, cultures, and populations of Los Angeles," it is
downright bizarre when he and Davis end up in a chat about whether
the excesses of the British East India Co. entitle the people of
India to sue the British government for reparations.</TE>
<TE>   "I was asked by a British newspaper if the Gujarat earthquake can
be blamed on the British," says Davis. "I said why not.... I think
the assets of the royal family are exactly what should be used to
meet these claims."</TE>
<TE>   For all its bombast, "Unmasking L.A." remains a provocative book
that adds to the rancorous but illuminating debate over the origin,
meaning and destiny of the City of Angels. And, despite its harsh and
unforgiving take, the volume concedes that Los Angeles, even if
lamentable, is somehow inevitable.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles may be "America's manifest destiny run amok," as
Sawhney puts it, but it is also "the epicenter of globalization, the
Ellis Island of the Pacific Century." And, for better or worse, as
Sawhney concedes, "Los Angeles defines the future of cities to come."</TE>
<TE>   Some of the same concerns about race and identity in the crucible
of contemporary Los Angeles can also be found in "Japanese American
Celebration and Conflict: A History of Ethnic Identity and Festival
in Los Angeles, 1934-1990," but here the focus is tighter and the
prose more disciplined. Lon Kurashige, a history professor in USC's
program in American studies and ethnicity, looks for the meanings
that are expressed in the celebration of "Nisei Week," an annual
festival mounted by the Japanese American community of Los Angeles
since 1934.</TE>
<TE>   Kurashige decodes and explains the "micropolitics" of Nisei
Week--the street parades and beauty pageants, talent shows and essay
contests, performances of music and dance, displays of arts and
crafts. "Always lurking in the celebration was the fact--and fear--of
racial conflict," explains Kurashige.</TE>
<TE>   The subtext of Nisei Week, as Kurashige points out, has changed
over the years. The festival began during the Depression as a way to
encourage second-generation Japanese Americans (Nisei) to "buy in
Lil' Tokio," as the downtown neighborhood was then known, by
reminding the younger generation of their heritage. Later, the appeal
reached beyond that community: "What stood as symbols of ethnic pride
for Japanese Americans were also exotic enticements for white
America." Even after 120,000 Japanese Americans were interned during
World War II, a "community fair" was presented behind the barbed wire
at Manzanar, although the dire circumstances prompted the
participants to send a very different message: "We are American," as
Kurashige sums it up. "We are not Japanese."</TE>
<TE>   By the 1970s, the politics of Nisei Week had changed yet again. A
group of high school students joined the street parade in 1972, for
example, but when they reached the reviewing stand at the center of
Little Tokyo, they burned a Japanese war flag as a way of protesting
"Japanese and American imperialism" in general and the war in Vietnam
in particular.</TE>
<TE>   By 1990, Nisei Week celebrated what Kurashige calls "the new
cosmopolitanism" as festival organizers "deliberately sought to
foster good relations with neighboring racial minorities by inviting
participation from groups of blacks, Latinos, Chinese, and other
Asian Americans." At the same time, the redevelopment of Little Tokyo
with money from Japanese investors created friction with the local
Japanese American community. "The bridge of ethnicity initially
designed to unite Japanese Americans," writes Kurashige, "was
transformed into a wedge that increased divisions in Japantown."
Kurashige's monograph may lack the splenetic quality of Sawhney's
manifesto, but the authors share a sense of outrage. Beneath the
surface of "Japanese American Celebration and Conflict" is a caution
against regarding Japanese Americans as a "model minority," thus
overlooking the impact of racism on both Asian Americans and African
Americans. "Yellow is a shade of black," Kurashige reminds us,
quoting Columbia University professor Gary Y. Okihiro, "and black a
shade of yellow."</TE>

<DH>BRIGHT EARTH: Art and the Invention of Color, By Philip
Ball Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux: 384 pp., $30</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BARBARA MacADAM</AU>
<BD>Barbara MacAdam is a senior editor of ARTnews.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"If I expect to see red, I prepare myself to see red," reads a red
neon wall installation by Conceptual artist Joseph Kosuth, better
known for using whites, grays and other neutral tones. Kosuth's piece
addresses some of the myriad ways we perceive color: our physical
ability to see it and the role of our expectations, our experiences
and our cultural, spiritual and stylistic associations. Kosuth is
more concerned here with the idea of color than what a color looks
like. Could he have used any other hue to the same end? How would we
react if he wrote the same remark but used blue? Does this red
require prior familiarity with the word and/or the color?</LD>
<LD>   Philip Ball, in his erudite and breathtakingly fast-reading book,
"Bright Earth: Art and the Invention of Color," begins his
exploration from a different perspective. He focuses on "the
substance of color"--its physical attributes. This, he explains, is
partly because he majored in chemistry and got a doctorate in
physics. And though his fondest associations are not necessarily
ours--"phthalocyanine," he writes, "speaks to me of chlorophyll and
blood." And "vermilion conjures up the sulfur and mercury of the
alchemists"--we are almost seduced. Giving color such tangibility is
compelling. It appeals not only to the sense of sight but also to
smell, touch and taste.</LD>
<TE>   Ball's excitement is infectious; his writing is clear and
engaging, conveying the magic and logic of chemistry. And while much
of the science and history of color have been dealt with
elsewhere--not least in John Gage's wonderful "Color and
Culture"--Ball makes original and insightful connections between
science and aesthetics. "Bright Earth" also traces color's social
history and its role in the annals of art history. It's as if Ball's
scientific acumen gave him access to art's inner sanctums.</TE>
<TE>   Literate and literary, Ball quotes a 7th century Byzantine writer
marveling at the colors of the peacock ("How could anyone who sees
the peacock not be amazed at the gold interwoven with sapphire, at
the purple and emerald-green feathers, at the composition of the
colours of many patterns, all mingled together but not confused with
one another?"</TE>
<TE>   He cites Alexander Pope in "The Rape of the Lock" equating sylphs
with insects ("While ev'ry beam new transient colours flings, /
Colours that change whene'er they wave their wings") but attributes
the iridescent effect to simple light scattering. And he offers John
Donne pondering, "Why grass is green, or why our blood is red/Are
mysteries which none have reach'd into." Or hadn't yet.</TE>
<TE>   Tracking the high points, accidents and curiosities of the
evolution of color manufacture, Ball begins with the Stone Age,
surprising us with how sophisticated the hunter-gatherers were about
their materials. They would grind up hematite with a mortar and
pestle, bind it with a medium like vegetable oil, and apply it ("a
Stone Age oil paint," Ball writes, adding, "And who was it who
dreamed up the idea of spray-painting the pigment with breath blown
through a tube?").</TE>
<TE>   The ancient Egyptians, who equated bright colors with wealth, used
a pigment known as Egyptian frit, or Egyptian blue, that dates back
to around 2500 BC. The mixture, made from chalk, malachite and sand,
was fired in a kiln at temperatures of up to 900 degrees Celsius and
then ground into a powder. It is, Ball claims, "the oldest synthetic
pigment, a Bronze Age blue."</TE>
<TE>   We know less about the Greeks' treatment of color. They were
apparently more concerned with theory than practice. Aristotle, for
one, said the true study of color was not to be found in mixing
pigments but in studying rays of pure color, echoing Plato's notion
that the purer the color, the closer to its essence. Also, fewer
colors allowed artists greater harmony of hue and mastery of light
and shade.</TE>
<TE>   The Romans, however, loved intense color and spared no effort or
expense in obtaining it. The rich Tyrian purple of Imperial Rome was
derived from shellfish--about 250,000 crustaceans yielded an ounce of
the dye. No wonder manufacturing pigment outside the Imperial dye
works could be punishable by death. And the Pompeiians used bright,
complementary colors in their frescoes, composed of six coats of
plaster, the first three made with increasingly fine grades of sand
and the next three with ground marble, which were then polished and
which retain much of their brilliance today.</TE>
<TE>   But it was the Middle Ages that marked the apogee of color
technology. Painting was a craft, and artisans had to know their
materials. Pigment shades were controlled by degrees of grinding.
Powders were mixed with binding agents, such as water, egg white or
egg yolk, each of which produced a different tone. (Oils, which
darken pigments, weren't commonly used until after the 15th century.)</TE>
<TE>   The fascinating chapter "Secret Recipes" explains how medieval
alchemists discovered the important mineral acids, sulfuric and
nitric. Before that, the only acid was vinegar, which was used to
make white lead--the most prevalent white paint until the synthetics
of the 19th century.</TE>
<TE>   Another innovation central to medieval painting was the making of
vermilion by uniting mercury and sulfur. Until the 11th century,
using vermilion, which is made from the powdered root of brazilwood,
to cover a page was as costly as using gold. It remained, however,
the best red pigment until the 20th century.</TE>
<TE>   Gold became the most desirable color in the 14th century--and it
couldn't be cooked up. It was royal, holy, stable and strong and
would be applied to gessoed panels in thin sheets (made by hammering
gold coins). The gold would adhere by means of a water mordant and
would then be rubbed to a high polish. Ball quotes the medieval monk
Heraclius advising, "Make it very brilliant with the tooth of a
savage bear."</TE>
<TE>   The shift from anonymous medieval monks making illuminated
manuscripts as a devotional activity to the individualism of the
Renaissance artist who could concentrate on design and composition
led to increasing specialization and to patronage. Patrons would
determine not only subject matter but also the kind and quality of
pigments--for example, whether an artist used cobalt, smalt or
indigo, ultramarine or azurite, the latter two the most expensive
blues. Fortunately, the Florentine craftsmen's guild would not permit
artists to use inferior materials.</TE>
<TE>   In the Renaissance, "truth to nature" displaced the medieval
desire to use expensive pigments as devotional offerings. By the 15th
century, artists showed objects in relief. Leonardo explained,
"Painting is a combination of light and shadow in close mixture with
the diverse qualities of all the simple and complex colors." His
style encompassed a somber palette, highlights revealing a source of
light and sfumato (or "smokiness.") Giotto had opened the way for
three-dimensional representation. "The observer is not reading the
image ... ," Ball explains, "but is present in the scene." Time and
linear perspective are suddenly relevant, conveyed through the device
of light and shade. The scenes contain real, not idealized, people.</TE>
<TE>   But then along came the Mannerists in the 16th century. They aimed
at a kind of strangeness (that looks kitschy to our contemporary
sensibility), marked by distortion and acidic colors in disturbing
combinations. Painters, not the least of them Veronese, El Greco and
Tintoretto, would use bright colors to appeal to the emotions.</TE>
<TE>   By contrast, Baroque artists such as Correggio, Caravaggio and
Rembrandt turned to "autumn's colors"--earthy browns--the dark shades
adding a kind of naturalism, albeit a highly theatrical one. For
Rembrandt, color expressed emotional and psychological subtleties.
Ball tells us he used just half a dozen pigments and eschewed strong
contrasts to create his subtle effects.</TE>
<TE>   When artists turned to landscape painting in the 16th century,
they sought new shades of green. They began mixing pigments
themselves (Velazquez combined azurite and yellow ochre to make
green). By the 17th century, the Netherlands had become a major
center for pigments. Ball tells of how there were two kinds of yellow
pigments in 17th century Dutch painting and late 18th century English
painting. When it was discovered in the late 19th century that one of
the pigments was made in India from cow's urine--in particular, cows
fed exclusively on mangos, a diet that didn't make for healthy
cows--the practice became illegal. So much for Indian yellow.</TE>
<TE>   Until the 19th century all colors were derived from
naturalmaterial. But industrial chemistry changed that. In 1841, the
American portrait painter John Rand invented the tin tubes that
replaced pigs' bladders for storing oil paints. This led to the
brilliantly colored paintings of the pre-Raphaelites who created a
hyper reality with their unblended jewel tones, and the
Impressionists, who daubed paints from the tube, letting viewers'
eyes do the color mixing.</TE>
<TE>   Artists could now obtain almost any color they could imagine, and
this led them to want something else. For the 20th century French
painter Yves Klein, it was the kind of intensity that could only come
from pigment without binding agents. Klein claimed that once powders
were mixed, "the affective magic of the colour had vanished." (Others
continue to agree, including Conceptual sculptor Anish Kapoor, who
covers his objects in raw pigment to dramatic, inscrutable effect.)</TE>
<TE>   "Klein," Ball explains, "longed to find a means of retaining the
intensity of pure color and so realize its full potential to awaken
the emotions of the viewer"--at the same time as he wanted to
undermine its purely decorative potential. In 1955 he came up with a
solution: to work principally in one color--at that time,
ultramarine.</TE>
<TE>   He was after the idea, as were Kosuth and so many other
contemporary artists. "For him, the technical achievement involved in
realizing this blue was a means to a conceptual end. Thus his
patenting of the new color, International Klein Blue . . . [was] a
formal validation of the metaphysical idea that his medium
represented and ... insurance against the possibility that others
would use it in ways that corrupted the 'authenticity of the pure
idea.' "</TE>
<TE>   The artist who seems to have most confounded Ball is Mark Rothko,
whose massive works aim at transcendental effects. To achieve this
end, he thinned his paints to the point where they were stains. Ball
laments that Rothko and other artists in the Color Field movement
expressed an intensity of feeling but "did not make for very
practical men." Rothko's paintings deteriorated, a byproduct of his
indifference to materials.</TE>
<TE>   Contemporary artists no longer understand their materials the way
the artisans of the Middle Ages did. Nor do many care, since
deterioration as an element of chance is built into the concept of
their work. "For the twentieth-century artist, the medium carries its
own message," says Ball.</TE>

<DH>BRYSON'S DICTIONARY OF TROUBLESOME WORDS: A Writer's Guide
to Getting It Right, By Bill Bryson, Broadway Books: 242 pp., $19.95</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MELISSA McCOY</AU>
<BD>Melissa McCoy is The Times' assistant managing editor
for copy desks.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Bill Bryson, the bestselling author who breathed fresh air into the
often-tedious genre of nature writing with his hilarious "A Walk in
the Woods," proved that being funny and being grammatically correct
are not mutually exclusive. With "Bryson's Dictionary of Troublesome
Words: A Writer's Guide to Getting It Right," he seems to be telling
us they might be, that writing about writing is very serious business
indeed.</LD>
<LD>   Bryson was working in the early 1980s as a copy editor for the
London Times when he wrote the first version of "Troublesome Words."
After more years of muddling through difficult questions about
grammar and usage, he has revised it with an Americanized flavor.</LD>
<LD>   "Troublesome Words" is a worthwhile addition to any writer's or
editor's reference library, if only for its common-sense navigation
through some of the trickier terrain of the English language. But the
eponymous work betrays its limited scope; it is much too thin to
stand alone as a definitive guide. Some passages convey the feeling
that one is reading the well-scrawled margins of a newspaperman's
stylebook.</LD>
<TE>   "As I observed in the first edition, the book that resulted might
more accurately, if less convincingly, have been called 'A Guide to
Everything in English Usage That the Author Wasn't Entirely Clear
About Until Quite Recently,' " he writes in the introduction, which
isn't to say that he has yet found all the answers.</TE>
<TE>   It is that self-effacing banter that is missing in the
alphabetized entries that follow and, from this clever and skilled
writer, it feels like a missed opportunity. Any writing guide
published today must compete with the work of the prescriptive
linguist Bryan A. Garner, whose "A Dictionary of Modern American
Usage" (1998) set a new standard by offering an accessible,
comprehensive, pragmatic guide to using the English language.</TE>
<TE>   Garner provides more than 750 pages of do's and don'ts, with a
minimum of maybes, those betes noires of serious writers and editors
everywhere. It is an indispensable guide for anyone who wants to
write more clearly but prefers his medicine without the schoolmarmish
tone dispensed by some of the giants of modern usage.</TE>
<TE>   Bryson chose not to write "Troublesome Words" as a rival to Garner
or to the revered, if sometimes quirky, language texts of H.W. Fowler
("A Dictionary of Modern English Usage," 1926; revised by Ernest
Gowers, 1965, and Robert Burchfield, 1996) or those of Theodore
Bernstein ("The Careful Writer," 1965) and John Bremner ("Words on
Words," 1980). Bryson's admonition in the introduction that "[w]hat
follows should be regarded less as a book of instruction than as a
compilation of suggestions, observations, and even treasured
prejudices" makes that clear. Bryson keeps the pedantry to a minimum,
but "Troublesome Words," part stylebook, part dictionary, part usage
guide, never delivers fully in any of these areas.</TE>
<TE>   Unfortunately, he didn't take the approach of Bill Walsh of the
Washington Post, whose wry "Lapsing Into a Comma: A Curmudgeon's
Guide to the Many Things That Can Go Wrong in Print--and How to Avoid
Them" (2000) is a useful if truncated language guide that doesn't
take itself too seriously, even if it considers good writing a
serious topic.</TE>
<TE>   "Troublesome Words" could use a snigger here and there to remind
us that it's one man's vision and that things get blurry from time to
time. None of this is to suggest that Bryson is a dabbler. He is a
well-regarded writer on a number of topics who, like Garner, has a
refreshingly common-sense approach.</TE>
<TE>   Bryson is a serious student of the language, ranting against the
overuse of the redundant "new" (as in "new record"), offering a
measured approach on "none" (it can take a plural or singular verb,
as long as the writer is consistent) and insisting that "bacteria" be
used as a plural noun. He lobbies for cutting the fat (the pre-in
"precondition," "preregister" and the like is unnecessary), roping in
the dangling modifier and accepting that "irregardless" is not, and
ought never be, a word.</TE>
<TE>   Although he acknowledges that language evolves, Bryson is mostly a
linguistic conservative like Garner. He doesn't subscribe to the
descriptive school that allows for the wholesale butchering of the
written word as the inevitable outcome of our lax standards in oral
communication. Descriptivists believe that if people say it, we
should accept its being written, even if it means turning our backs
on the basics of good grammar.</TE>
<TE>   Although he will not cave to the forces of substandard English on
the differences between "comprise" and "compose," he gives in to the
descriptivists when he refuses to stand his ground on the oft-misused
"begging the question," reasoning that its definition as a circular
argument in logic has been lost to those who need a fancier way to
say somebody invited or raised a question.</TE>
<TE>   Bryson rightly preaches against the misuse of "enormity" to
indicate something large (it may be large, but it also must be
outrageous or wicked) yet is willing to allow "loan" and "lend" to be
used interchangeably, even though most serious grammarians insist on
the use of "loan" only as a noun.</TE>
<TE>   He offers wise counsel on the numbing effects of repeating
acronyms, the confusing results of piling adjective upon adjective
and the reckless misuse of percents. (A tax reform bill that cuts the
top rate from 50% to 25% cuts the rate by half, not 25% as a
newspaper headline announced.) He offers helpful explanations of
"tortuous/torturous" and myriad other misusages that regularly stump
us all.</TE>
<TE>   "Affect/effect," "it's/its," "amid/among"? The proper use of
"crescendo"? They're here. But he lists "hark" and "hearken" as if
for spelling purposes only, failing to explain the difference between
them and how each is to be used. (They both mean to listen carefully,
but when one wants to indicate the return to another point or time,
"hark back" is preferred.)</TE>
<TE>   Although Bryson prohibits the redundant "totally destroyed," he
incongruously argues for "partly destroyed," reasoning that there "is
simply no other way of putting it without resorting to more
circuitous descriptions." ("Damaged" is an alternative that newspaper
reporters and editors find works well.)</TE>
<TE>   There is a bit of everything here, including some trivia only a
copy editor could love: Hans Christian Andersen (not -son); the
Uffizi Gallery in Florence; Sir Thomas Malory (one l); hartebeest
(not -beast) for the African antelope.</TE>
<TE>   An entry on the misuse of "bemused" or a primer on sequence of
tenses would have been a better use of space. But that is the flaw in
most such works; they cannot possibly be comprehensive, for each of
us has his or her own set of nits and picks.</TE>
<TE>   "Troublesome Words" is an accessible guide, worth picking up for
its measured approach to the myth of never splitting an infinitive.
Or if only to confirm that Nullarbor Plain is correctly spelled with
two Rs and is in Western Australia.</TE>

<HD>Just How 'Victorian' Were the Victorians?</HD>
<DH>SCHNITZLER'S CENTURY: The Making of Middle-Class Culture
1815-1914, By Peter Gay,  W.W. Norton: 336 pp., $27.95</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>FREDERIC MORTON</AU>
<BD>Frederic Morton is the author of "The Rothschilds: A
Family Portrait" and "A Nervous Splendor: Vienna, 1888-1889," both
National Book Award finalists.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In his very personal "My German Question," Peter Gay showed how his
family, German middle-class Jews, thrived in the 1930s; how, between
occasional tremors, they kept on thriving for a while even after
Hitler took power; and how, barely in time, a Cuban visa saved them
from perdition. The book is so resonant because its protagonists are
not sequestered in some ghetto of hallowed prey. The author shares
their humanity with ours, a poignant mix of heart and hope and
fallibility.</LD>
<LD>   His memoir was a piece of moonlighting. After all, Gay's day job
is that of eminent historian. But in his case (not the first such, of
course) autobiographical circumstance seems to animate professional
impulse. That would apply especially to Gay's massive work "The
Bourgeois Experience: Victoria to Freud." His five-volume study
grants a sort of Cuban visa to the entire Western middle class,
thriving through its Victorian heyday to the brink of World War I and
the precipices of the psychoanalyzed unconscious.</LD>
<TE>   But what Gay saves the Victorians from in that study is not
history but other historians; specifically, as he puts it, from
"post-modern merchants of subjectivism." He appears to consider them
intellectual janissaries loosed by the counterculture to assassinate
the values of the establishment's progenitor, namely the 19th century
bourgeoisie. Gay's attempt at image rehab was exhaustively detailed
and industriously nuanced. He mined many social labyrinths and
visited far-flung byways to acquit the Victorians, not without
tactical reservations, of the charge of being repressed materialistic
hypocrites. In the end, he pronounced their character to be the
noble, stalwart, if somewhat sooty, engine of progress.</TE>
<TE>   It's an argument heroic not only in scope but in valor. Gay is a
tireless champion of so difficult a cause. Certainly he produced an
imposing reference work, no matter how a reader might judge its
conclusions. "Schnitzler's Century" is like a shorter, slighter echo
of Gay's brave manifesto of redemption. But Gay protests in the
preface that "Schnitzler's Century" is not "merely a Reader's Digest
condensation of the bulky texts that preceded it" because he added
new material and "complicated" his previous reinterpretation of
Victorian culture.</TE>
<TE>   True, the fine patina of his style is much closer to, say, Thomas
Babington Macaulay than to pop magazines. But his additions only add
without deepening. He cites as new evidence of the Victorian age's
vitality and energy, for example, the instructions in the English
Woman's Domestic Magazine on how to kill a turtle for turtle soup.
Does this prove that the Victorian lady was much more of an
unfettered, free sensuous spirit than previously thought? I just
can't summon enough Freudian ingenuity to follow him here.</TE>
<TE>   As for the "complications," Gay's chief one is implicit in the
title. The Austrian playwright Arthur Schnitzler had a teenage
confrontation with his father when Schnitzler senior read his son's
diary without permission. Gay returns to the episode again and again
as a thematic refrain encompassing the Victorian age. The young
Schnitzler would develop into a virtuoso of the dramaturgy of fin de
siecle role-playing. For Gay, Schnitzler is "a credible and
resourceful witness to the middle-class world" whose life adds a
narrative thread to his book, which he describes as the "biography of
a class." Yet this single incident with his father, tacked on as
insistent, ponderous ostinato, strikes no organic roots and so fails
to inspirit Gay's undertaking.</TE>
<TE>   What remains, then? The iteration of Gay's plea that the
Victorians have not only been unjustly charged with prissiness but
have also contributed more to society through cultural investments
than they ever inflicted with their relentless materialism. Well, let
me quote on this subject a Victorian contemporary who formed his
opinion not through scholarly inference, as Gay does here, but by
direct, firsthand observation during a visit to 19th century England:</TE>
<TE>   "There should be a temperance in making cloth as well as in
eating. A man should not be a silkworm nor a nation a tent of
caterpillars. The robust rural Saxon degenerates in the mills to the
Leicester stockingers, to the imbecile Manchester spinner--far on the
way to be spiders and needles.... In true England all is false and
forged.... In view of these injuries some compensation has been
attempted in England. A part of the money earned returns to the brain
to buy schools, libraries, bishops, astronomers, chemists, artists
with; and part to repair the wrongs of intemperate weaving by
hospitals, savings banks, Mechanics Institutes, public grounds and
other charities and amenities. But the antidotes are frighteningly
inadequate, and the evil requires a deeper cure...."</TE>
<TE>   Writing this in his "English Traits," Ralph Waldo Emerson is but
one in a chorus of eyewitnesses of comparable credentials and
lamentations who beg to differ. "Gentlemen of England," John Ruskin
importuned, "if you would ever have your country breathe the pure air
of heaven again and receive a soul into her body instead of rotting
into a carcase ... you must teach her that all the true greatness she
ever had, she won while her fields were green and her faces
ruddy...." The poet Gerard Manley Hopkins is another:</TE>
<TE>   ... all is seared with trade; trade; bleared, smeared with toil</TE>
<TE>   And wears man's smudge and shares man's smell; the soil</TE>
<TE>   is bare now, nor can foot feel, being shod ...</TE>
<TE>   As well as Victoria's poet laureate, Alfred Lord Tennyson:</TE>
<TE>   ... why are we weighed upon with heaviness,</TE>
<TE>   and utterly consumed with sharp distress,</TE>
<TE>   while all things else have rest from weariness?</TE>
<TE>   All things have rest; why should we toil alone,</TE>
<TE>   we only toil, who are the first of things,</TE>
<TE>   and make perpetual moan,</TE>
<TE>   still from one sorrow to another thrown ... .</TE>
<TE>   And William Wordsworth:</TE>
<TE>   The World is too much with us; late and soon,</TE>
<TE>   Getting and spending, we lay waste our powers:</TE>
<TE>   Little we see in nature that is ours...</TE>
<TE>   For this, for everything we are out of tune ...</TE>
<TE>   Gay records Matthew Arnold's plaint ("this strange disease of
modern life, / With its sick hurry, its divided aims ... ") along
with John Stuart Mill's shudder over "the sabbathless pursuit of
wealth." But for him, such grousing by these writers only takes "a
part for the whole, casualties for the norm." He speculates that many
of the negative descriptions of the Victorian soul might be a
consequence simply of "the unprecedented attention that physicians
were paying to female complaints," which "... made neurasthenia more
eye-catching than before."</TE>
<TE>   He also attributes the dark moods of that era to that historical
constant (and irritant) known as change. It is of course the quality
of the change that largely defines the quality of an era. Gay hurries
through this paramount issue in a few pages in which the benefits of
the Victorian transition receive sharper focus than its harms.</TE>
<TE>   His coda acclaims the Victorian age as "an admirable century"
whereas "one thinks back on the 20th century with horror." So
swiftly, so smoothly, then, was the horrible sired by the admirable?
There is some novel demonology here. There is also much competent
hagiography. Only the historiography is wanting.</TE>

<LD>THE HEAVEN OF MERCURY</LD>
<LD>   By Brad Watson</LD>
<LD>   W.W. Norton: 260 pp., $23.95</LD>
<TE>   In Brad Watson's extraordinary debut novel (he's the author of a
previous collection of stories), nearly a century of life in a
Southern town is held within the ample memory of octogenarian Finus
Bates. Finus is the gimlet-eyed editor of the Mercury, Miss., Comet
and does the morning slot on WCUV-AM, where he offers up his daily
reveille--"Good morning in the a.m. to y'all, each and ever one of
you" before slapping on a beat-up 45 of "The Star-Spangled Banner"
and getting on to news of local bridge triumphs.</TE>
<TE>   There's a wonderfully casual, shambling pace to Finus and "The
Heaven of Mercury." Like the stunningly out-of-bounds obituaries that
Finus writes, the book mixes whimsy and hard truth in a way that's
heartbreaking. Take, for instance, Finus' obit for his own estranged
wife: "Avis Crossweatherly Bates died last night, bitter and twisted
in her body by the disappointments in her life...." Finus knows he
was the source of Avis' distress. After all, he's been in love with
her best friend, Birdie, since 1916, when he accidentally saw her do
a nude cartwheel out at the swimming hole.</TE>
<TE>   Mercury is the kind of place where the funeral director has
inappropriate desires, where relationships are near-misses, where
poker games can decide the path of a man's life and where people grow
old--and die--before our eyes. Pungently erotic, and as affectionate
as it is acidic, Watson's portrait of a town full of "dry and twisted
hearts" is a perfect modern Southern gothic.</TE>

<TE>   THE FROG KING</TE>
<TE>   By Adam Davies</TE>
<TE>   Riverhead: 306 pp., $13 paper</TE>
<TE>   Into the ever-burgeoning pantheon of underachieving antiheroes
stuck in cubicle hell steps Harry Driscoll: twentysomething editorial
assistant, total screw-up. In Adam Davies' fractured fairy tale about
corporate and romantic back-stabbing in New York's publishing world,
Harry--the eternal amphibian for whom princehood is forever out of
reach--contorts himself into a number of comic poses: stealing food
from a Lhasa Apso at the Westminster dog show, faking an orgasm with
a powerful publishing matron and singing Emily Dickinson's "Because I
Could Not Stop for Death" to the tune of "Gilligan's Island." Such a
clever lad. But not clever enough for brainy Evie Goddard, his
wisecracking girlfriend and sylphlike colleague at Prestige Books. "I
bill Anita Loos as her spiritual grandmother," Harry tells us,
smitten. But through a reckless campaign of sloth and selfishness,
Harry loses both Evie and his modest berth at Prestige, then spirals
toward dangerous self-awareness: "I am the cliche. I don't know
anything about love."</TE>
<TE>   Evie won't give him the time of day, and we wonder why we should
either: The arc of Harry's wacky unraveling is painfully familiar and
overdrawn. Even so, Davies can make us laugh despite ourselves: He's
like the office cut-up who won't stop until we give in. "The Frog
King" has its many warts, but it knows how to jump too.</TE>

<TE>   THE COLOR MIDNIGHT MADE</TE>
<TE>   By Andrew Winer</TE>
<TE>   Washington Square Press:</TE>
<TE>   258 pp., $24</TE>
<TE>   In his first novel, Andrew Winer explores the life and times of
Conrad Clay, a 10-year-old boy who inhabits the kind of streetwise
kids' world we recognize from the work of S.E. Hinton. And with its
simple, straight-up prose, "The Color Midnight Made" could fit right
in beside any of Hinton's books on the Young Adult shelf.</TE>
<TE>   Conrad is, both literally and figuratively, colorblind: He
discovers--much to his humiliation--that he can't discern reds and
greens when an eye doctor visits his school. The greater issue of
color--race--is also largely invisible to him.</TE>
<TE>   He's one of the only white kids in a predominantly black
neighborhood of Alameda, and he's blissfully unaware of ethnic
differences. His best friend is a black kid known as Loop, and Loop's
extended family becomes a kind of surrogate. Conrad's own family is a
mess: There's his abusive, alcoholic Pops and his long-suffering,
out-of-it Moms.</TE>
<TE>   When his hard-nosed grandmother dies, Conrad becomes more isolated
than ever. He spends his days skateboarding ("decking") around the
'hood, hanging out in a questionable locale known as Slime Canal and,
after Loop abandons him for being a "squid" (uncool and white), he
begins to build a pipe bomb.</TE>
<TE>   Conrad is a sympathetic loner who speaks in an argot borrowed from
the homeboys who offer him acceptance and yet hold him at bay. If
"The Color Midnight Made" is up to its neck in billboard-sized
symbolism (the character Midnight is a local blind man) and often
veers into sentimentality, Conrad is a colorful narrator who opens
our eyes to a fascinating pre-adolescent realm.</TE>

<DH>LIVING IN SPANGLISH: The Search for Latino Identity in
America, By Ed Morales, St. Martin's Press: 310 pp., $25.95</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>EARL SHORRIS</AU>
<BD>Earl Shorris is the co-editor, with Miguel
Leon-Portilla, of "In the Language of Kings: An Anthology of
Mesoamerican Literature," and the author of "Latinos: A Biography of
the People" and "Under the Fifth Sun: A Novel of Pancho Villa."</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In 1490, in the palace of Tecayehuatzin, lord of Huexotzinco, a group
of Nahua princes who were also poets met to discuss the provenance of
art and its relation to life and thought. Near the end of the
"Dialogue of Flowers and Song," Prince Ayocuan tells the others,
"Friends, listen to the dream of a word," and then speaks of "life,
enabling us to see."</LD>
<LD>   Like many works left to us by Mesoamerican civilization, this poem
was concerned with language as well as life, for the authors
recognized language as the defining human characteristic. So aware of
the importance of language were these Mesoamericans that they chose
to call themselves Nahuas ("clear speakers").</LD>
<LD>   Race, on the other hand, was not of interest in pre-Hispanic
America, although there were recognizable physical characteristics
that could have been used to distinguish among various groups (shorts
and talls, for instance, rather than lights and darks). As the
Mesoamericans noted, race is a foolish business no matter what the
defining characteristics. They were too subtle in their observations
to construct a racial system; they drew distinctions according to
language, very much like the ancient Greeks. The Greeks thought the
language of strangers sounded like "barbarbar," so they called them
Barbarians. The Nahuas thought the language of some strangers sounded
like "popopo," so they called them Popolocas.</LD>
<TE>   Languages change, however, none more than English, which is the
most inclusive language, leaping from a vocabulary of 50,000 words to
double that number with the inclusion of words brought over from the
continent by the Norman conquest. Other languages also change, but
none quite so rapidly as English. In the Americas, James Lockhart has
collected the borrowings from Spanish used by the Nahuas during the
years following the invasion. In North America, the Navajos, upon
encountering a motorcycle, devised a new and very onomatopoeic word
for the curious vehicle: "put-put." Tomatoes and chiles are Nahuatl
vegetables. "Canoe" was borrowed from the indigenous people of the
Caribbean, who had borrowed it from indigenous people of South
America's east coast. The process of language growth has almost
always been an inclusion of foreign words.</TE>
<TE>   Among people who speak more than one language, code-switching
(changing from one language to another) occurs regularly. That should
not be confused with Spanglish, which is not switching easily from
one language to another by bilingual or multilingual speakers. In
popular music, which Ed Morales knows and speaks of with authority in
"Living in Spanglish," code-switching works especially well. He
points out that Latin jazz was and remains a spectacularly successful
blend of rhythms, melodies and orchestrations.</TE>
<TE>   In literary works, say, a novel by Saul Bellow or Carlos Fuentes,
the English or Spanish text may be enriched by words or phrases from
French, Greek, Latin and so on. Europeans are fond of pointing out to
Americans that people who speak only one language are not civilized.
Following that rule, one would expect people in the Americas to speak
at least English and Spanish. Since the Americas are rich in
languages, it would seem that the hemisphere presents a great
opportunity to keep alive this most glorious of human creations.</TE>
<TE>   Morales offers the view that, in the United States, both English
and Spanish should die. Instead of favoring bilingual education
(English for Spanish-speakers and Spanish for English-speakers), that
civilized notion, Morales argues for Spanglish, a third language.
Spanglish, which is ill-defined, like any form of pidgin, is a
language of colonized people. Spanglish blurs the lines between
English and Spanish in confusing ways: a carpet, for example, is
called "carpeta," even though carpeta in Spanish means "folder." A
library becomes "libreria" in Spanglish, but libreria in Spanish
means "bookstore" (biblioteca means "library"). Poets may make use of
it to express their anger, but in everyday use it is not the language
of protest but of people on their knees. Pidgin has always been an
effective way to keep colonized people in that vicious place. For
Latinos, who have the highest high school dropout rate of any defined
group, according to the National Center for Education Statistics, the
promotion of a form of communication that insinuates colonial
sensibilities and reduces the ability to communicate in both the
dominant and ancestral languages is tragic.</TE>
<TE>   Language, as everyone knows, is both denotative and connotative.
Morales, whose family came to New York from Puerto Rico, writes that
Spanglish began in Puerto Rico, and he attributes it to Puerto Rico's
colonial status. In the eyes of many people, especially those who
favor independence for Puerto Rico, the island has been a colony
longer than any other place on Earth. The promoter of Spanglish
opposes independence, which would probably lead Puerto Rico away from
Spanglish to Spanish or bilingualism as the colonial mentality was
replaced by the sense of self-worth that comes with autonomy.</TE>
<TE>   From its roots in colonialism, Spanglish attaches easily to class.
Morales writes mainly about popular culture and the now tired view of
Latinos mired in drugs and prison life. No doubt, some Latinos use
drugs and suffer imprisonment, but nowhere in Morales' book does one
find anyone like Alicia Juarrero, the philosopher whose "Dynamics in
Action: Intentional Behavior as a Complex System" has enjoyed global
interest; nor do we hear of Dr. Jaime Inclan, who was named family
therapist of the year; nor is there a mention of Joaquin Avila Jr.,
who won a voting rights case before the U.S. Supreme Court by a vote
of 9-0.</TE>
<TE>   Spanglish is not spoken by any of these people, who are,
respectively, of Cuban, Puerto Rican and Mexican heritage.
Interestingly, none of the three accepts the role of internally or
externally colonized person. A posteriori or a priori, however one
chooses to consider Spanglish, it attaches not to pride but to
surrender.</TE>
<TE>   The other factor connected, throughout history, to pidgin has been
race: darker-skinned people trying desperately to find some means to
do business with technologically, economically and militarily
superior light-skinned people. Promoters of Spanglish take up that
connection and attempt to turn it into a virtue, but it cannot be.
Language has no color. A posteriori again, Chinua and Christie Achebe
speak English as well as I do, but I have no Igbo. The Nigerian
author of "Things Fall Apart" and his wife, a historian, and I are
limited to English. Not pidgin. The failing is mine, not theirs. They
are bilingual--English and Igbo. They understand very well the
concept of legitimate power.</TE>
<TE>   Language itself is of little interest to the author of
"Spanglish." Morales writes about La Malinche (or Malinalli), Hernan
Cortes' mistress and translator, whom he describes as a Maya. But the
Aztecs spoke Nahuatl, not Maya (the languages are mutually
unintelligible). Had Malinalli been a Maya, rather than a Nahua sold
into slavery to the Maya, she would not have been able to translate
for Cortes. Morales frowns upon the idea of learning Nahuatl today,
attributing it to Chicanos of "the hard left." But compared with the
submissive Spanglish, learning Nahuatl is, like bilingualism, the
business of civilized people.</TE>
<TE>   If language is the grandest of human inventions, the essence of
diversity, the wealth of the world, then every language deserves to
be nurtured, and no language, neither English nor Spanish nor Nahuatl
nor Igbo, should be deprived of its uniqueness. By the making of
languages, humans are most like gods: independent, creative,
heaven-borne on wings of subtlety. By the gift of languages to each
other we are the generous makers of civilized life. If we unmake
languages into pidgins, we begin the fall, we burden the generations.</TE>

<AU>EUGEN WEBER</AU>
<BD>Eugen Weber is a contributing writer to Book Review.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In the tawdry barrens where would-be thrillers lurk, Robert K.
Tannenbaum's novels stand out as oases in a desolate waste: vivid,
witty, unflagging and zestful. "Absolute Rage" is one more of the
same, and it's a champion.</LD>
<LD>   The Majestic Coal Corp. holds Robbens County, W.Va., in thrall. It
has the miners union in its pocket along with the mayor, judge,
police and assorted mandarins of McCullensburg, the county seat. Then
a reforming labor leader, Red Heeney, a bigmouthed Irish upstart,
gets murdered for his pains along with his wife and his young
daughter. Not an unusual occurrence in those parts, and all would be
supine again in the most corrupt county in the state if Rose Heeney
had not been a friend of Marlene Ciompi.</LD>
<LD>   A semiretired Sicilian desperada, Marlene decides to avenge dead
friends. She has long resented cruel, malevolent people getting away
with murder all around, has wanted to stop them, has wanted to kill
them, has demonstrated that she's good at it. But she can't live that
way, now that she's become the mother of three lovely children, all
legal offspring of Butch Karp, the chief assistant district attorney
for New York County. So she has turned into the good mom of a nicely
loony household and a businesswoman who raises, trains and sells
large dogs on a Long Island farm.</LD>
<TE>   Rose Heeney's death brings Marlene and her slavering mastiff to
McCullensburg, where she joins forces with the Heeneys' two surviving
sons, dries out a drunken local lawyer and stirs up a barrel full of
vicious local snakes. Her husband follows her. Karp is weary of
Manhattan deskwork, bored with the genteelly corrupt bureaucracy that
keeps him in a safe, respectable, tedious job "supervising the
installation of impoverished morons in state penal institutions."</TE>
<TE>   He jumps at the invitation of West Virginia's governor to become a
special prosecutor and bring justice to a corrupt town. Nor does he
disdain underhanded tactics if they help to nail the brutal thugs he
faces there.</TE>
<TE>   Because Robbens County runs by its own rules and these disdain the
ruly, alarms, excursions and slaughter are rife. But neither Butch
nor Marlene will triumph by relying on law enforcement.</TE>
<TE>   The thugs are impregnable on a mountaintop above a maze of
tunnels. They will be terminated with extreme prejudice by the
intervention of Marlene's gangster friends, more vicious than the
locals and more efficient too.</TE>
<TE>   The Heeneys are revenged in spades, though this plays havoc with
Butch's ethics and distresses the Karps' daughter who, as a believing
Catholic, leaves the extermination of the unrighteous to God. So we
leave the family a bit battered but hoping to meet them again soon.
The blurb declares Tannenbaum addictive and, for once, the blurb is
right.</TE>
<TE>   Suspend disbelief ye who pick up Philip Rosenberg's "House of
Lords." If you do, you're in for a treat. Jeffrey Blaine, a
successful, youngish New York investment banker, is ambushed by
gangsters who want him to launder their ill-gotten gains. The
gangsters get more than they bargained for, so does Blaine and so do
Rosenberg's readers, who are offered a breathless switchback ride as
well as a crash course on links between investment banking and
organized crime or more disorganized but no less fraudulent
enterprises.</TE>
<TE>   Blaine has a good time running rings around federal authorities
and asserting money-spinning superiority over (other) crooks. His
daughter, Jessica, is another kettle of catfish. Beautiful,
addle-pated and spoiled rotten, the 18-year-old is out of control: a
fount of shallow self-indulgence cast as self-affirmation. She lives
on impulse in a world where every impulse seems licit, learns to do
drugs and to get beaten up by her gangster boyfriend, then gets raped
by the gangster boss who uses her mother and works with her father.</TE>
<TE>   There's lots of affluent phoniness and much menace; volatile
relationships abound, and so does ill-focused police work. You can
hear the pelf slosh around. Wheels churn within wheels, and cogs bite
on cogs bedeviling business relations, subverting marriages whose
chains turn out so heavy that they take three to bear. And the
language these people use!</TE>
<TE>   In the end, some players are benched and some are buried, but
nobody really wins anything beside money (which is nothing to sneeze
at) except the reader who has been sped through lucid, convoluted and
relentless rapids of action. My only cavil is that if you're going to
make sophisticated references, you'd better get them right. The Paris
restaurant mentioned on Page 15 should be L'Archestrate, and its chef
was Alain Senderens.</TE>
<TE>   Crime yarns have sprouted one more subgenre: the ethnic
detective--Asian, Black, Latino, Native American or Jewish. Pending a
rattling good yarn about Sikh shenanigans or Muslim mayhem, Orthodox
Jews will have to do, and Faye Kellerman's "Stone Kiss" serves them
up dripping with multicultural color.</TE>
<TE>   But, even when seasoned with a lot of gore, the exotic fare can't
turn a stodgy story into a savory snack. The basic premise--that an
L.A. police lieutenant would drop everything and dash off to New York
because the relative of a relative has been murdered and another is
missing--is unconvincing to start with. Then, his failure to abandon
the unwelcoming clan that invoked his aid is the most mystifying part
of the mystery.</TE>
<TE>   As it stands, Decker's family jihad begins and ends in blood. Its
twists and turns involve weird, illegal activities, an old foe turned
uncertain confederate, and ethnic protagonists of all ages, genders
and sects, most of them unattractive. The action is frenetic, the
local color is underwhelming and the climax is climactic, but it
doesn't come soon enough.</TE>

<LD>An Inland Empire single mother of two is among the first in Southern
California to participate in a homeownership program that allows
eligible families to use their Housing and Urban Development rental
assistance vouchers to make monthly mortgage payments.</LD>
<LD>   In an effort to boost homeownership among low-income working
families, the Housing Authority of the County of San Bernardino is
using conventional mortgage financing to enable Section 8 recipients
to buy a home, under the county's new Section 8 Housing Choice
Voucher Program. Under the terms of the program, families eligible
for rental assistance may qualify for a mortgage based on their
current earned income, combined with the housing-assistance
subsidies.</LD>
<LD>   Participants must be first-time home buyers, earn a minimum
monthly income of twice the voucher payment standard, and have held a
full-time job for two years. Additionally, participants must
contribute 3% of the down payment costs; 1% must come from their own
funds.</LD>
<TE>   Partners in the voucher program include Cal Fed Lending,
Neighborhood Housing Services of the Inland Empire and Fannie Mae.</TE>

<LD>As rents continue to rise, so do the number of people looking to
share a rental.</LD>
<LD>   After all, why pay $1,200 for a two-bedroom when you can pay $600
for your share?</LD>
<LD>   Here are suggestions for making roommate life a little easier.</LD>
<TE>   * Compile an inventory of your personal traits. Start at the
beginning of the day and move forward. Are you an early riser? Do you
have food preferences that are unique? Do you smoke or drink? Your
lifestyle should be compatible with the person sharing your space.</TE>
<TE>   * What are you looking for? Some people just think about saving
the rent money and forget there's more to the equation.</TE>
<TE>   Make a list of traits you absolutely will not tolerate in a
roommate.</TE>
<TE>   Are you the late-night party type or workaholic type? Housekeeping
habits, cooking arrangements and level of privacy should also be
considered.</TE>
<TE>   * What will the arrangements be regarding overnight guests,
especially those who are not on the lease? Clearly decide in advance
on a time limit for guests (hours, days, etc.).</TE>
<TE>   * Decide who gets the parking space (if any) and when. Will you
take turns? First come, first take?</TE>
<TE>   If one roommate gets exclusive right, be sure to adjust the rent
share accordingly to avoid resentment.</TE>
<TE>   * What are you able to afford? Make sure to factor in the cost and
sharing of utilities--especially the telephone, which can be
expensive and frustrating to share.</TE>
<TE>   * Find out if the potential roommate has or desires a pet.</TE>
<TE>   * How long do you plan to room with someone? A year? Longer? Time
is money if a lease is broken, so be sure your timelines are
compatible.</TE>
<TE>   * Determine responsibility. Do you prefer to lease a place
together or be the sole responsible party? If you choose to bring in
a roommate into an existing situation, check your lease. Subletting
is not always allowed. Be sure to get the owner/manager's written
permission before giving someone the keys to your place, since you
could be evicted for breaching this important clause.</TE>
<TE>   * When seeking a roommate, ask friends, family and people you
trust. If you are a college student, most colleges and universities
have a housing office that provides roommate information. Several
roommate-listing services are also available for a fee. Be wary;
anyone can put in an ad. Applicants are not usually prescreened. Ask
for picture identification and proof (such as student identification)
of any representations made. Credit checks should also be considered.</TE>
<TE>   * Once you've found a roommate, the next step is set up rules, in
writing. Several roommate contracts are available through Internet
search engines, bookstores and housing offices. Many recommend
getting legal advice before signing any document.</TE>
<TE>   * Before you move, be sure to fill out an
inventory/condition-of-unit checklist so everyone agrees to the
condition at move-in.</TE>
<TE>   * Everyone signing the lease will be jointly and severally
responsible for everything in the document. "Joint and several" means
"all for one and one for all." If a roommate moves out, the remaining
residents are still responsible for the total amount of the rent due
and any damage.</TE>
<TE>   * The security deposit is joint and several, with a twist. If
someone moves out, the deposit remains with the unit.</TE>
<TE>   Owners don't usually return deposits until everyone moves out,
since the deposit is basically insurance for the unit and the
tenancy. The remaining (or new) tenant has to buy out the departing
one. Contact the owner and find out what deductions should be made.</TE>
<TE>   Once you've decided on the correct amount due, be sure that the
departing roommate assigns his or her share in writing to the unit.
At final move-out, the owner will divide (and make deductions from)
the remaining deposit in equal shares, unless the lease says
otherwise.</TE>
<TE>   * Always put agreements in writing, and ask for legal advice if
needed. Ink lasts longer than memory and makes clear everyone's
rights and responsibilities.</TE>

<HD>Homeowners Hiring More Work Out</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Americans now spend about $180 billion on home improvements annually,
up from $150 billion in 1995, estimates the National Assn. of Home
Builders. And more and more, they are calling on professionals to do
those jobs rather than tackle them themselves.</LD>
<LD>   That's good news for professional home remodelers but a challenge
for retailers such as Home Depot and Lowe's. The retailing empires
built to supply do-it-yourselfers increasingly are offering building
services through their stores.</LD>
<LD>   With home refinancings and equity loans running at record levels
amid the lowest interest rates in years, homeowners have access to
cash. Real estate has been a bright spot in the stay-at-home,
post-Sept. 11 economy, and homeowners want their property in tiptop
shape to reflect its rising value.</LD>
<TE>   But the do-it-yourself share of home-improvement projects is
gradually slipping, giving way to professional jobs. According to the
National Assn. of Home Builders Research Center, do-it-yourself
projects accounted for 38% of all home improvements in 2001, down
from 44% in 1999.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the percentage of homeowners hiring contractors for
home projects rose to 53% last year from 46% in 1999.</TE>
<TE>   The shift to using more professionals has been fueled by the aging
of baby boomers and a rise in single-person households. As homeowners
get older and reach their peak earning years, they are more likely to
hire pros than undertake repairs themselves. Busy lifestyles also are
encouraging the trend.</TE>
<TE>   "The older homeowners get, the greater the preponderance to hire a
professional for the work, from painting and wallpapering up to an
addition on the house," said Rick Strachan, group publisher at
construction magazine publisher Hanley-Wood.</TE>
<TE>   As the demand for professional home improvement services has
risen, businesses in the industry have mushroomed. The number of U.S.
remodeling firms increased 52% in the 10 years through 1997, with
specialty contractors such as roofers, electricians and carpenters
accounting for most of the rise, according to the Joint Center for
Housing Studies at Harvard University.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, do-it-yourself retailers such as Home Depot and
Lowe's are seeking their slice of the so-called do-it-for-me market,
offering installed-sales programs for everything from ceiling fans to
kitchen cabinets.</TE>

<LD>Termites are responsible for more than a billion dollars of damage
repair and treatment annually in the U.S.</LD>
<LD>   The conditions that invite these pests can be corrected. Here are
some suggestions:</LD>
<LD>   * Cracks in stucco and gaps in siding should be repaired and
properly sealed.</LD>
<TE>   * Soil surrounding the foundation should be 8 inches below the
lowest portion of siding or stucco, and graded to drain away from the
house.</TE>
<TE>   * Support wood porches, stairs, decks and trellises with concrete
footings or piers.</TE>
<TE>   * Repair plumbing leaks and make sure that tub and shower wall
coverings are thoroughly grouted and caulked.</TE>

<LD>A great many veterans are eager to return to the areas where they
served in wartime. Responding to this desire, several specialized
military tour operators have emerged.</LD>
<LD>   These companies are active despite the advanced years of their
World War II customers. Veterans of the Korean and Vietnam wars are
filling the gap, and the major veterans' tour operators are doing
well. Reunion trips are especially popular.</LD>
<LD>   Nine Dragons Travel &amp; Tours, (800) 909-9050, www.nine-dragons.com,
specializes in tours to spots that were significant in the Vietnam
War. Nine Dragons is owned and operated by Jerry Landman, an Army
veteran and now a history professor. It offers 22 itineraries of
interest to Vietnam veterans and people interested in military
history. Tours range from 10 days to three weeks and cost about $150
per day for guides, accommodations and meals. Air fare is additional.</LD>
<TE>   Valor Tours Ltd., (800) 842-4504, www.valortours.com, was formed
in 1976 by Bob Reynolds, a veteran of Britain's Royal Air Force. It
operates tours to famous battle sites and historical destinations in
Europe, Britain and the Pacific. Most tours cost about $300 a day,
but that figure includes round-trip international air fare, such as
transportation to England's World War II airfields for a 12-day
"Twelve O'Clock High" trip, starting at $3,350 from Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Olympus Travel, (213) 380-0886 or (888) 467-6000,
www.olympustravelusa.com, was founded in 1980 by Don Youk. It is best
known for its Korea Revisit Program for Veterans, a joint venture
with the Korean National Tourism Organization and the Korean Navy
League. Along with visits to historical sites and war memorials,
veterans have two formal dinners and first-class accommodations.
These services don't come cheap, but they're reasonable considering
that round-trip air is included. The six-day package starts at $1,395
with air from Los Angeles. There are usually about a half-dozen
departures a year, most in the spring and fall. Extensions are
possible to places such as China and Vietnam.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, the English company Holts Tours, 011-44-1304-612-248,
www.battletours.co.uk, offers military history tours for veterans and
history buffs. Holts provides expeditions to battle sites of World
Wars I and II in France, Germany, England, Italy and Eastern Europe,
as well as a few other trips to significant sites in the Hundred
Years' War and the American Civil War.</TE>
<TE>   The most popular trips revolve around the two World Wars,
including a tour of D-day beaches and landing zones, an excursion
studying the planning and actions of the Battle of the Bulge and a
journey of remembrance to the Warsaw Ghetto, Treblinka and Auschwitz
in Poland. Expect to pay $175 to $250 per day for land costs
only--tour guides, motor coach transportation, lodging and some
meals.</TE>

<HD>Other Airlines Must Honor Tickets of Stranded Passengers</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Compiled by Jane Engle</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Passengers stranded when a bankrupt airline cancels flights are
entitled to fly standby on other carriers for no more than $25 each
way, the U.S. Department of Transportation has ruled.</LD>
<LD>   The Aug. 8 notice was issued after the department received
complaints about the treatment of passengers stranded when Vanguard
Airlines filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection and stopped
flying July 30. The ruling noted that some carriers provided standby
or confirmed reservations free to Vanguard passengers, but others
charged up to $100.</LD>
<LD>   After the DOT ruling, Delta Air Lines--which offered Vanguard
passengers the choice of an "administrative service fee" of $100 to
exchange their Vanguard tickets for standby Delta tickets or buying
confirmed seats at a discount--said it would refund the difference
between the $100 fee and the new allowable charge of $25 each way.
"If they [customers] can produce the paperwork ... they will be
eligible for the difference," Delta spokesman Anthony Black said last
week.</LD>
<TE>   The DOT ruling was designed to clarify a law passed after the
Sept. 11 attacks.</TE>
<TE>   The law required that scheduled airlines honor tickets of
passengers stranded by an airline bankruptcy "to the extent
practicable" but did not define "practicable." The Aug. 8 ruling says
such passengers must be accommodated "on a space-available basis on
the date of travel shown on the ticket or other documentation ...
without significant additional charges." It does not require airlines
to provide confirmed reservations for such passengers or limit fees
to do so.</TE>

<LD>Medjet Assistance, an 11-year-old company that provides medical
evacuation and emergency medical consultations for travelers, has
added a new benefit for motorcycle riders: transporting their bike
back home.</LD>
<LD>   The benefit is available to members of the Harley Owners Group and
the BMW Motorcycle Owners of America for the standard annual fee that
other customers pay for Medjet coverage: $195 for individuals and
$295 for a family, a spokesman for the Birmingham, Ala.-based company
says. The company will return customers' motorcycles to a shop or
dealership near their home if they cannot ride for medical reasons on
trips in the U.S. (except Hawaii), Canada and Mexico. (800) 963-3538,

<HD>Park Lodges in West Have More Vacancies</HD>

<SE></SE>
<AU>Compiled by Jane Engle</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>There is more room at the inns at western national parks, making it
easier to book lodging for summer and fall.</LD>
<LD>   Concessionaires were expecting fewer foreign visitors this summer,
a trend accelerated by skittishness after the Sept. 11 attacks. But
hopes that Americans might make up the difference were dashed by
publicity about wildfires in Arizona and Colorado, officials said.</LD>
<LD>   At Arizona's Grand Canyon National Park, Maswik Lodge had rooms
available on most dates through September and virtually all dates in
October, the Internet site of concessionaire Xanterra Parks &amp;
Resorts, www.xanterra.com, showed last week. Bright Angel Lodge &amp;
Cabins, while booked for August, had some open dates in September and
October and many in November. By contrast, El Tovar--the high-end
lodge traditionally in most demand--was booked through October.</LD>
<TE>   Wyoming's Grand Teton National Park also reported more available
rooms than usual, which officials attributed partly to economic
uncertainty and the recent tendency to book at the last minute.
Although the luxury Jenny Lake Lodge had only a few nights open
through Oct. 5, when it closes, Jackson Lake Lodge had vacancies on
most dates in September, according to the Internet site of the
concessionaire, Grand Teton Lodge Co., www.gtlc.com.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Tourists who long to indulge their Tarzan fantasies--or just get a
bird's-eye view of the world--are getting a chance in the tropical
forests near the resort town of Puerto Vallarta, Mexico.</LD>
<LD>   Vallarta Adventure, a 6-year-old tour operator, this summer began
offering a "Tree Top Canopy Tour." Suspended from pulleys,
participants slide along about 400 feet of cable strung between
trees, dangling up to 100 feet above the forest floor. From that
vantage point, they can see "a lot of birds and reptiles, including
iguanas," a spokeswoman says.</LD>
<LD>   The trip costs $65 for adults and $32.50 for children younger than
12, including beverages and snacks and an hourlong drive to the
Sierra Madre site from Puerto Vallarta. You spend about two hours in
the trees. For reservations (recommended), call toll-free (866)
256-2739 or visit www.vallarta-adventures.com.</LD>

<HD>2 Former Renaissance Ships to Sail for Princess</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Compiled by Jane Engle</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>P&amp;O Princess Cruises has acquired two 688-passenger ships formerly
operated by Renaissance Cruises, which filed for Chapter 11
reorganization last fall, and plans to deploy them to the Pacific.
The sister ships were built in 1999.</LD>
<LD>   The R4, redubbed the Tahitian Princess, will sail year-round out
of Papeete, Tahiti, in French Polynesia, the Cook Islands and Samoa.
Fares for the debut holiday cruise, leaving Dec. 24, start at $899
per person, double occupancy, with early booking discounts. Fares
after that begin at $799 for 10-day sailings.</LD>
<LD>   The R3 will split its time between sailing for Princess and for
P&amp;O Cruises' Australian brand in the South Pacific. Itineraries and
schedules have not been announced. The R3 will sail as the Pacific
Princess after Princess' "Love Boat" of TV fame gives up the name and
embarks on its new life as an Italian charter vessel in October.</LD>

<HD>Not Too Idle, Not Too Wild in Idyllwild</HD>
<DH>Two urban cowboys ride high, balancing outdoor adventures
with mountain R&amp;R</DH>

<DL>IDYLLWILD, Calif.</DL>
<LD>I never feel as though I'm really in the mountains until I can smell
them. So my trip to Idyllwild, perched a mile high in the San Jacinto
range, didn't feel like vacation until the scent of pine surrounded
our convertible somewhere along Highway 74.</LD>
<LD>   My friend Scott, who entered fatherhood less than six months ago,
was along for the ride. Last month his benevolent wife granted him a
weekend pass for a getaway of hiking, horseback riding and a generous
dose of R&amp;R.</LD>
<LD>   All of that is easy to find in this town of about 3,000. The
abundance of outdoor adventures is paired with a simple, somewhat
artsy mountain town. The annual Jazz in the Pines festival, Aug. 24
and 25 this year, draws thousands. But it's the village's eclectic
shops selling woodcarvings, Native American crafts and homemade
snacks that help to attract visitors all summer.</LD>
<TE>   The Web sites www.idyllwild.com and www.idyllwildchamber.com give
ideas for activities and lodging, including rental cabins. I found a
link to Muir's Mountain Vacation Rentals, which offered a place
called Crock for $115 per night. I was taken aback by the $50
management fee on top of the 10% room tax, but the cabin still seemed
a good value. The agent reminded me that we needed to supply linens
and soap.</TE>
<TE>   The immaculate shingled cabin turned out to be paneled throughout
with warm knotty pine. The entry had a sofa bed and opened onto a
kitchen, bathroom, cozy living room with dining area, and a lovely
back porch overlooking a small ravine--dry now but no doubt a
babbling brook in spring. A loft with a queen-size bed functioned as
the main bedroom.</TE>
<TE>   The decor was quaint enough in a country-print and
artificial-flower-arrangement kind of way--but given the reasonable
price, I didn't expect more.</TE>
<TE>   At Cafe Aroma near the center of town, we snacked on
fresh-from-the-oven basil-and-rosemary focaccia until our garlic
bisque and exquisite chicken and vegetable soup arrived. For entrees,
we ordered the nightly specials: Dijon-encrusted swordfish and a
tender veal chop, both accompanied by succulent grilled asparagus and
garlic mashed potatoes. Everything was exceptional.</TE>
<TE>   We bought groceries, meandered back to the cabin and played
dominoes until midnight as a cool breeze carried a forest scent
through open windows.</TE>
<TE>   We slept in and ate a light breakfast on the patio. The sky was
pastel blue, and the granite boulders on the mountainsides were
already shining white, reflecting the brilliant sun. Blue jays winged
about the tree canopy, but we had trouble finding the motivation to
move.</TE>
<TE>   Around 11 o'clock, having enjoyed plenty of idle but not much
wild, we set out for a hike and stopped in town to pick up
lunch-to-go at Clover's Honey Shop and Bakery. A few customers sat
out front drinking coffee and working on softball-size cinnamon buns.</TE>
<TE>   As Scott and I entered, a counter full of pies caught my eye. So
did racks holding huge Rice Krispies treats, saucer-sized cookies and
brownies as big as my day planner. We dug into a plate of samples.
Though not the most succulent treats we've had, the epic proportions
were undeniable. Scott chose a slice of Rainbow Pie, prepared with
seemingly every kind of fruit. I chose a slab of Rice Krispies treat.</TE>
<TE>   I can't remember ever being intimidated by a sandwich, but my eyes
bulged as the clerk loaded handfuls of cold cuts onto freshly baked
12-inch rolls, layered on toppings and handed over the hefty
sandwiches. I dubbed mine "The 2-Pounder," picked up some bottled
water and headed out.</TE>
<TE>   At the Idyllwild Ranger Station, the ranger explained that there
are more than 10,000 acres of designated wilderness in Mt. San
Jacinto State Park and more than 80 miles of trails. Options ranged
from the Fuller Ridge Trail, a 7 1/2-mile trek with a 3,000-foot
elevation gain, to the relaxing Ernie Maxwell Scenic Trail, a 2
1/2-mile path that runs along the base of the hills above Idyllwild.</TE>
<TE>   We decided on Devil's Slide Trail, a 2 1/2-mile hike with an
elevation gain of 1,700 feet. We picked up free permits at the ranger
station, parked at the trail head at Humber Park above town and
hoofed it.</TE>
<TE>   The path is relatively smooth, its mild incline lined with
manzanita and shaded by towering white fir and sugar, Jeffrey and
ponderosa pines. Squirrels and lizards skitter over sun-bleached
boulders.</TE>
<TE>   Other hikers warned us about a rattlesnake about 3 feet long.
Clearly in no mood for attention, it slid silently into the brush a
safe distance from the trail.</TE>
<TE>   Throughout the day we passed fewer than 20 people on the way to
Saddle Junction. Two were rangers who checked our permits, and half
were children younger than 10. We talked with a couple of families
making their way down from the Palm Springs Aerial Tramway, which
carries riders up the other side of the mountains. Somewhere, two
devoted dads were driving from Palm Springs to Idyllwild to collect
these happy hikers.</TE>
<TE>   At Saddle Junction, signposts marked the Pacific Crest Trail,
which runs from Canada to Mexico. That trail took us toward Tahquitz
Peak, and after less than a mile we left PCT for boulder-strewn
ridges and views of the San Jacinto wilderness and Idyllwild. On the
clearest days, Santa Catalina Island is visible, according to the
locals.</TE>
<TE>   A refreshing wind blew over the ridge. We clambered up a ledge of
rough granite and devoured our "2-Pounders" and desserts.</TE>
<TE>   By twilight we were back at Crock, reading and relaxing on the
porch before moseying into town in search of dinner. Live music from
the Good Times Pub and Grill caught our attention. The outdoor patio
filled as a duo played lively folk music and ballads.</TE>
<TE>   Scott ordered a half-rack of saucy pork ribs with a side of
grilled zucchini. I wrapped my hands around a barbecue pork sandwich
with a side of sweet-potato fries. The food was fine, the service
small-town friendly, the entertainers genuine and heartfelt.</TE>
<TE>   Scott and I laughed at the who's-on-first possibilities Sunday as
we drove to the Hay Dude Ranch. ("Hey, dude. Do you know where I can
rent some horses?" "Hay Dude.") Before saddling up, we stopped at the
Bread Basket in Idyllwild for French toast Provencal made with
apple-nut bread and the Hearty American Breakfast of eggs, sausage,
fruit, home fries, breads and muffins.</TE>
<TE>   The ranch is five miles down the mountain, adjacent to McCay Park.
A wrangler named Barbie saddled up Mocha and Canada, our
rent-a-steeds for the next two hours. (The per-person rate is $30 per
hour or five hours for $125; no riding experience is necessary.) We
kicked up dust as we rode through meadows and forest, up hillsides
and across boulder-strewn fields.</TE>
<TE>   Mocha and Canada proved calm and nimble, negotiating sand and
rock, gullies and hills with equal aplomb. We rewarded them with
carrots at the end of the ride.</TE>
<TE>   Back at the cabin we cleaned up and checked out. We picked up pie
for Scott's wife at Clover's, enjoyed French dip sandwiches and curly
fries at the Idyllwild Cafe, then descended Highway 74 as the scent
of pine faded away.</TE>

<HD>In Tallinn, Celebrating Medieval Times</HD>
<DH>Estonians, free to set their own course, re-create their
capital's glory days</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KRISTIN L. JOHANNSEN</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>TALLINN, Estonia</DL>
<LD>Street vendors' cries, colored banners flying, footsteps hurrying
across cobblestones, a Babel of foreign tongues, merchants hanging
woolens under the town wall. These were the sights and sounds of
Tallinn 700 years ago--and they still are.</LD>
<LD>   Since Estonia broke away from the Soviet Union in 1991, its
capital has proudly gone back in time. Not to the country's first
brief period of independence, between the two world wars, but to its
glory years in the Middle Ages. Then it was one of the wealthiest
cities on the Continent as a member of the powerful Hanseatic League,
which controlled commercial activity in northern Europe.</LD>
<LD>   In June my husband, Kevin, and I spent three days soaking up the
city's medieval atmosphere while on a trip to other countries along
the Baltic Sea. Estonia is the size of Switzerland and has a
population of only 1.4 million. Along with its Baltic neighbors
Latvia and Lithuania, it was dominated by German traders for
centuries before falling to imperial Russia. The country gained
independence in 1920 only to be occupied by Hitler's army in 1941,
then swallowed up by the Soviet Union in 1944.</LD>
<TE>   Finally free to set their own course, Estonians now are
celebrating their past. A modern, almost Scandinavian-looking city of
low-rise glass office buildings and apartment blocks fades into
blocky Soviet-era suburbs beyond the massive stone wall of the old
town. I found it hard to believe that the Gulf of Finland once washed
the gates of medieval Tallinn. Tea Reinald, our guide, explained that
over the centuries geological forces have caused the land to rise 2
millimeters per year, pushing back the coastline and enabling the
city to grow from its ancient heart on the hill called Toompea, where
we started our walk.</TE>
<TE>   Though an Estonian settlement existed here more than 1,000 years
ago, Tallinn entered recorded history when it was invaded and
Christianized by the Danes in 1219. Tallinn means "Danish city" in
Estonian. The city's key location on the eastern shore of the Gulf of
Finland made it attractive to the Germans, Swedes and Russians, all
of whom later fought over and controlled Estonia at different
periods, leaving their mark on the capital.</TE>
<TE>   From the top of the hill, we looked down on the 13th century wall
and four of the stout watchtowers that protected the wealthy town
from invasion. One huge round tower received its peculiar name, "Kiek
in de Kok" ("peek into the kitchen," in the German dialect of the
Hanseatic traders), because its high windows enabled guards to watch
the goings-on in houses below. Nearby, the Maiden Tower was
supposedly a prison for prostitutes. Nowadays it contains a cafe.</TE>
<TE>   During the Middle Ages the aristocracy and clergy crowded together
on the hill, while the city's businessmen traded below. In a way,
that's still true. As we walked around Toompea, Reinald pointed out
the pink classical facade of the palace where the Estonian parliament
meets, opposite Alexander Nevsky Orthodox Cathedral, which serves the
Russian minority left behind in the city after the collapse of the
Soviet Union.</TE>
<TE>   Nearby, the Dome Church, Tallinn's oldest (dating to 1233), was a
work in progress for more than 500 years. Its stern, whitewashed
Gothic walls didn't get their ornate steeple until 1779, a Baroque
fantasia of domes and cupolas with a needle-sharp spire piercing a
gleaming golden ball.</TE>
<TE>   In the Middle Ages, only two roads led from Toompea into the lower
town. The Gate of "Short Leg Street," for pedestrians, was locked at
9 every night to keep riffraff off the hill. Like privileged
aristocrats, we followed "Long Leg Street," the carriage route, down
toward Raekoja Plats, the town hall square. As noon chimed on the
clock of the town hall, the cobblestoned square bustled, as it must
have in Hanseatic days. Visitors from distant lands gawked up at the
lofty church spires, and a woman in a blue velvet gown tried to lure
travelers into her tavern. Adding a modern touch were two Hare
Krishna devotees offering Indian sweets to baffled passersby.</TE>
<TE>   Customers hurried into the Raeapteek, a pharmacy that was
operating in the same spot in 1422. Now they were stocking up on
aspirin and toothpaste instead of unicorn horn and pulverized
gemstones. But the pharmacy's mini-museum shows off its centuries-old
apothecary jars, labeled in Latin, and wood contraptions for making
pills.</TE>
<TE>   Nearby, the newly revamped Tallinn City Museum, in the
thick-walled house of a merchant built in 1363, explains all about
the Hanseatic League with hands-on displays. At its peak from the
13th through 15th centuries, the league was a confederation of 100
German-founded trading cities stretching from the Norwegian fiords to
the heartland of Russia. The Hanseatic League operated something like
the European Union, permitting free trade across national borders.</TE>
<TE>   Tallinn was particularly wealthy because Hanseatic law required
all trade between east and west to be weighed and reloaded there.
From Russia, barrels of honey and furs, bales of flax and slabs of
wax passed through the city. (Hundreds of tons of beeswax were needed
annually to make candles for the Catholic churches of Europe.) In
turn, woven fabrics, silver, hops for beer and sea salt were shipped
east. One archeological dig here found coins from China, Scandinavia,
the Byzantine Empire and Germany jumbled together.</TE>
<TE>   The museum's exhibits don't end with the city's medieval past. On
the top floor we were fascinated to find the Soviet era encapsulated
in displays with sardonic English titles like "Buying Power" (shoddy
clothes, with the abacus used to sell them) and "Three Bearded Ones"
(kitsch portraying communism's founders, Marx, Engels and Lenin). At
the final display, a group of Estonian teenagers sat mesmerized by
video news footage of the 1991 struggle for independence.</TE>
<TE>   With our guide, we visited the Song Festival Grounds, an enormous
outdoor theater where the independence movement was launched 15 years
ago.</TE>
<TE>   The 1980s, Reinald said, was a decade of national reawakening,
with Estonians becoming more conscious of their national identity and
hungry for independence. Their revolution took off on an unusual
note, proving, in this case at least, that the voice is mightier than
the sword. In September 1988, a folk song festival--folk singing has
long been dear to Baltic hearts--at the theater suddenly turned
political. More than 300,000 people began singing the Estonian
national anthem, forbidden under Soviet rule.</TE>
<TE>   "I was there," Reinald said. "People held hands and had tears in
their eyes. It was a very emotional thing."</TE>
<TE>   Between rounds of patriotic songs, participants held political
meetings. Later song festivals drew even more people into the
nonviolent protest, culminating in a chain of 3 million people that
stretched nearly 300 miles across the three Baltic countries--half
their total populations.</TE>
<TE>   Today Estonians are justly proud of their "singing revolution,"
which won them independence without the loss of a single life.</TE>
<TE>   In Tallinn, even shopping has medieval overtones. Alongside the
usual modern shops selling specialties like woodcarvings, Baltic
amber jewelry and linen, we found an ancient passageway crammed with
artists' workshops and galleries owned by the Katariina Gild. The
members' work (including silver jewelry, quilts and handmade hats) is
top quality, but some of the craftsmen could use a lesson in
free-market etiquette. One gallery owner greeted me by saying, "What
are you doing here?"</TE>
<TE>   I got a warmer reception at the "wall of sweaters," a narrow lane
where heaps of woolens glow under the ancient arches of the town
wall. Not everything was handmade, but the designs were appealing,
from cats to snowflakes to traditional geometric motifs. And the
price was right; some hand-knit sweaters were less than $50.</TE>
<TE>   Despite its pride in its past, Estonia is hardly mired in
quaintness. It's a comprehensively wired (and wireless) nation. Rates
of cell phone and Internet usage are the highest in Eastern Europe,
and I easily found an Internet cafe to check my e-mail. As I
struggled with the unfamiliar keyboard, a 9-year-old boy at the next
computer gave me helpful advice in perfect English without looking up
from the game he was playing. He then started explaining all the
different types of weapons in his game.</TE>
<TE>   "Your English is really good," I told him.</TE>
<TE>   "I know," he said, and went back to buying a sword.</TE>
<TE>   On our last evening in Tallinn, we decided to splurge, and joined
a group of travelers for a medieval banquet at a restaurant called
Olde Hansa. At the top of a long stairway, we entered a shadowy room
lighted only by white candles that poured torrents of wax onto tables
and shelves. The plastered walls bore medieval murals, and the dark
beamed ceiling hung low over our heads. Through the noisy mob of
diners, we could hear the wail of medieval music.</TE>
<TE>   "Good evening, merchants!" our waitress yelled above the din. She
looked like a recent arrival from another century, a young woman in a
long red gown with a white snood over her blond hair and a leather
purse at her waist. She scolded us for our dirty hands, then poured
warm water into a basin for us to wash them before we took our seats
on stools at a long wood table.</TE>
<TE>   Our serving wench, wearing appropriately saucy smiles, fetched
course after course. We shared spiced walnut bread, huge olives,
jet-black rye bread, cream cheese, sweet saffron pickles, sour herbed
pickles, horseradish sauce, jam made from bitter red berries. She
brought us white wine and stoneware mugs of cinnamon beer that took
both hands to lift. Next came a bowl of fresh cheese curds in warm
herb sauce, and more bread.</TE>
<TE>   Those were just the appetizers. After an hour or so, we finally
reached the main courses: "game pot" (a rich stew of wild boar and
elk), a mound of chicken legs with almonds, and accompaniments of
spiced lentils, turnips, barley with hazelnuts and a wonderful smoked
sauerkraut. I had just decided that medieval food was not so strange
after all when dessert arrived: a bowl of melted cheese topped with
sickly-sweet carrot jam. It was, well, unique.</TE>
<TE>   According to the menu, this is what they ate in 1450, and the
authenticity is no accident. A noted local historian is a consultant
to the restaurant, which has a branch in the former Hanseatic city of
Bergen, Norway.</TE>
<TE>   Around us, there was jovial yelling in many languages as people
approached the bottom of those vast mugs of beer. We were sinking at
last into the mellow, candle-lighted glow when, at the next long
table, a dozen men began singing loudly (and drunkenly).</TE>
<TE>   First I was annoyed because their racket made conversation
impossible. But then I had to laugh. After all, what could be more
authentic?</TE>

<HD>Mission Trails Park Offers Up the Wilder Side of San Diego</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN McKINNEY</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The people who run Mission Trails Regional Park--5,760 acres on the
eastern edge of San Diego--say it is one of the largest urban parks
in the United States. With nearly 50 miles of well-marked trails as
well as ample parking and a superb interpretive center, Mission
Trails is a great place to experience the wild side of the city.</LD>
<LD>   When San Diego started planning Mission Trails in the 1960s, the
park was considered off the beaten track. But suburbia has advanced
on three sides of the park, and Highway 52 lies on the fourth.</LD>
<LD>   A visitor center offers plant, animal and archeological displays.
Heed the call of the wild on the walk up to the center and the
unusual audio experience along the way.</LD>
<TE>   The Visitor Center Loop and Oak Grove Loop trails start nearby.
The 1 1/2-mile Visitor Center Loop is an 11-stop interpretive path
keyed to a free brochure. The one-mile Oak Grove Loop drops into a
tree-filled ravine with a seasonal creek. Hikers can improvise a kind
of figure-eight by combining the two trails.</TE>
<TE>   Two excellent publications available at the visitor center can
assist your exploration of Mission Trails. "Walking San Diego"
(Mountaineers Books, $15.95), by Lonnie Burstein Hewitt and Barbara
Coffin Moore, is a detailed guidebook describing hiking at Mission
Trails and nearby Mission San Diego de Alcala. It features more than
100 family-friendly hikes, all less than a one-hour drive from
downtown. The other publication is the Mission Trails Regional Park
Trail Map (Sunbelt Publications, $4.95), which is clear and colorful.</TE>
<TE>   Directions to the trail head: From Interstate 8 in San Diego, a
few miles east of its junction with Interstate 805, take the
Fairmount Avenue/Mission Gorge Road exit. Turn north on Mission Gorge
and drive 4 1/4 miles to the Mission Trails Regional Park entrance.
Turn left on Father Junipero Serra Trail, then make another left to
reach the visitor center and parking lot.</TE>
<TE>   The hike: The Visitor Center Loop Trail starts back down the park
access road by a vehicle gate. It descends to a woodland of coast
live oaks and a signed junction with Kumeyaay Grinding Site Spur
Trail, which branches to the right. This intriguing side trail
reaches flat rocks near the San Diego River. The native Kumeyaay used
stone pestles to grind acorns and seeds in the rock depressions. For
kids, poking around the riverbanks often is the highlight of a trip
here.</TE>
<TE>   Back on Visitor Center Loop, the path travels west, then south
above the river. The trail passes an old quarry site, then joins a
wide dirt road for the ascent toward Mission Gorge Road and your
return to the visitor center. The Oak Grove Loop I mentioned above
starts across the driveway from the visitor center.</TE>
<TE>   Other trails are easy to access too. Father Junipero Serra Trail,
the park road that runs from the visitor center through Mission Gorge
to the Old Mission Dam, is divided into a one-way lane for cars and a
two-way lane for cyclists and walkers.</TE>
<TE>   Depending on your time and energy, you can walk two miles from the
visitor center to the Old Mission Dam. Or you can drive there and
take trails that explore the environs of the San Diego River. The
three-mile round trip from Mission Dam to and through Oak Canyon is
one of the best hikes in the park.</TE>
<TE>   Once familiar with the park, ambitious hikers can tackle
1,591-foot Cowles Mountain, the highest summit in San Diego. The
classic southern approach (three miles round trip with an elevation
gain of about 1,000 feet) begins at a trail head at the intersection
of Navajo Road and Golfcrest Drive.</TE>

<HD>Cruise Control: On Some Lines, Tips Are Automatic</HD>
<DH>The growing practice of adding the gratuity to the bill
saves passengers confusion and hassle--if not money.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JANE ENGLE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>John Williams of Hermosa Beach was dismayed when he learned that
Princess Cruises would automatically charge him $10 a day for
gratuities on his Mexican Riviera sail in April.</LD>
<LD>   "Maybe I'm 'old school,' " he said in an e-mail, "but I don't
think tipping should be automatic.... I think that ... tipping should
be a reward for service [that] truly is above and beyond."</LD>
<LD>   But after talking to waiters and his room steward on his cruise,
he changed his mind. "They were all strongly in favor of automatic
tipping," he says, "because so often they get stiffed."</LD>
<TE>   An increasing number of cruise companies are adopting so-called
automatic gratuity programs. The companies say such programs spare
passengers the confusion of figuring out who gets what and the hassle
of juggling money. Cynics may suspect the real purpose is to shanghai
your wallet, but in fact, the amounts charged are close to what
travel agents recommend customers tip anyway.</TE>
<TE>   The confusion about cruise tipping is understandable. There are
headwaiters, waiters, assistant waiters, cabin stewards and others
who may expect gratuities--or not. Some cruise lines, especially
luxury ones, discourage tips. As recently as 2 1/2 years ago,
Seabourn Cruise Line staff members could be fired for accepting tips,
says spokesman Bruce Good. Now they may accept them but can be fired
for soliciting them.</TE>
<TE>   Alas, not all cruise lines that encourage tipping recommend the
same amounts, and the job titles of the crew may vary too. But most
suggestions are in these ranges, per passenger per day:</TE>
<TE>   * Cabin steward/stewardess/attendant: $3 to $4.</TE>
<TE>   * Waiter/server: $3 to $4.</TE>
<TE>   * Assistant waiter/busboy: $1.50 to $2.50.</TE>
<TE>   * Headwaiter/head server: 50 cents to $1.</TE>
<TE>   Tips at the spa and salon, if you visit them, are typically 15% to
20% of the cost of the service.</TE>
<TE>   Some cruise lines recommend adding lesser amounts for an
assortment of other staffers, such as the maitre d' and table
captain, but there's little consensus on these practices. "If the
maitre d' has done absolutely nothing for me and I've never seen him,
I don't tip him," says Judy Lucas, manager of Concierge Cruises and
Tours, a travel agency near Tucson. It annoys her that automatic
gratuity programs may include such employees regardless, but she
notes that the typical $10-per-day total per passenger is not far off
what you should leave anyway.</TE>
<TE>   Bartenders are a special case. Many lines automatically include
15% for service in the bar bill, meaning you needn't tip. If you're
unsure, ask. Lucas and others suggest you may want to tip a bartender
at the end of the cruise anyway if he or she has served you
frequently.</TE>
<TE>   Passengers traditionally leave tips in envelopes on the last night
of the cruise, which can lead to quite a backup at the purser's desk.
With automatic gratuity programs, you avoid that, obviously. But an
important point about such programs is that you usually can opt out
of them or increase or decrease the amounts by notifying the purser
once you're on board. You don't have to do it their way.</TE>
<TE>   Your best sources for tipping guidelines on your particular cruise
are travel agents and the line you book. Here's a roundup of some
lines' general practices. (All amounts are stated per passenger per
day, unless otherwise noted.)</TE>
<TE>   * Carnival: The line has an automatic gratuity program (which it
calls a "reverse gratuity program") on 10 of its 16 ships, with a
daily charge of $9.75. The company hopes to expand the program
fleetwide within a year, says spokeswoman Jennifer de la Cruz. In
so-called alternate dining rooms (outside the main one), the
reservation fee includes a tip. Bar bills include a 15% gratuity.</TE>
<TE>   * Costa: On Caribbean cruises, the suggestion is $3 each for
steward and waiter, $1.50 assistant waiter, $1 headwaiter. On
European cruises, the amounts are $1.50 steward, $2.50 waiter, $2.50
"assistant waiter team," 50 cents for maitre d' and "headwaiter
team." Bar bills include 15% gratuity.</TE>
<TE>   * Cunard: Automatic gratuity program, begun in 2000, charges $7 on
Caronia and $11 to $13 on the Queen Elizabeth 2, depending on cabin
category. Bar bills include a 15% gratuity.</TE>
<TE>   * Crystal: The line suggests $4 each for stewardess and waiter in
the main dining room; $2.50 assistant waiter, $4 for butler
(penthouse only); an additional $6 per meal for alternate
restaurants. Passengers can tip in advance when they book the cruise.
Bar bills include 15% gratuity.</TE>
<TE>   * Disney: Gives suggestions by length of cruise; on average per
day, about $3.60 for steward, $3.70 server, $2.70 assistant server,
90 cents head server. You can tip in advance, as do about half the
guests, a spokeswoman says. Bar bills include 15% gratuity.</TE>
<TE>   * Holland America: Advertises a "tipping not required" policy and
declines to suggest amounts. "You're free to tip if you feel it's
warranted," spokesman Erik Elvejord says. "To be honest, most people
do tip." Bar bills do not include gratuity.</TE>
<TE>   * Norwegian: Automatic gratuity program charges $10 per day for
ages 13 and older, $5 for children 3 to 12, no charge younger than 3.
Bar bills include 15% gratuity.</TE>
<TE>   * Princess: Automatic gratuity program fleetwide charges $10 per
day; the final two ships added to the program in July were the Royal
Princess and the Regal Princess. Bar bills include 15% gratuity.</TE>
<TE>   * Radisson Seven Seas: No tipping expected. But "if someone has
gone out of their way or been extra nice, people do tip," says
spokeswoman Brina Anelli, adding that she has sometimes seen crew
members decline tips.</TE>
<TE>   * Royal Caribbean: It suggests $3.50 each for waiter and steward,
$2 assistant waiter, 75 cents headwaiter. Passengers can tip
automatically by asking at guest relations (purser) when they board.
Bar bills include 15% gratuity.</TE>
<TE>   * Seabourn: "Tipping is neither required nor expected," the line's
Internet site says. "Our staff doesn't expect it ... and we pay them
well," spokesman Good says. But he adds: "If the guest wants to give
a tip, who are we to say no?"</TE>
<TE>   * Silversea: "No gratuities are required or expected" on this
luxury line, where fares can average $800 per day and up, says
spokesman Brad Ball. Passengers can tip if they want, "but we don't
encourage it," even for spa treatments, he adds.</TE>
<TE>   * Windstar: Advertises a "tipping not required" policy on its
Internet site. "Gratuities are not encouraged at all," sales
coordinator Jordan Marona says. "But if people want to tip [for
exceptional service], that's their prerogative."</TE>

<LD>Let's hear it for grandparents.</LD>
<LD>   Grandparents (many older baby boomers among them) represent a
third of all leisure travelers, and more than one-third of them have
traveled with grandchildren in the last year, according to a recent
survey.</LD>
<LD>   It might be a weekend in New York City, a week touring national
parks or a trip overseas to retrace the family's roots in Italy or
Scotland. The size of the travel budget doesn't matter. What counts
is grandparents' desire to show their grandkids a little piece of the
world.</LD>
<TE>   Elderhostel offers more than 100 trips (many priced at $500 per
person) designed for grandparents and grandchildren. Call (877)
426-8056 or visit www.elderhostel.org. Companies such as Grandtravel,
(800) 247-7651, www.grandtrvl.com, and Abercrombie &amp; Kent, (800)
323-7308, www.abercrombiekent.com, cater to well-heeled grandparents
and offer special family itineraries throughout the U.S. and abroad.
For outdoors-loving grandparents and grandkids, the Sierra Club,
(415) 977-5522, www.sierraclub.org/outings, has family trips to
destinations from Cape Cod, Mass., to Hawaii.</TE>
<TE>   Those who love learning with their grandkids could check with
their college alumni association to see whether it offers any family
trips. You may also want to consider a family learning camp offering
classes for kids and adults alike, such as the one at Cornell
University in Ithaca, N.Y., (607) 255-6260, www.cau.cornell.edu, or
the one at historic Chautauqua Institution, (716) 357-6250,
www.chautauqua-inst.org, in southwestern New York.</TE>
<TE>   One reader was eager to find videos of national and state parks--a
great idea for anyone about to head out on a parks trip with the
grandkids. You should be able to find some at the library or at a
large video rental outlet, or you can visit the National Park Service
Web site, www.nps.gov, where you can link to the bookstores at
individual parks. The PBS series "Great Lodges of the National Parks"
is available on video and DVD. The VHS tapes are $19.98 each, or
$69.98 for the four-tape set. Each of the two DVDs is $24.98. Visit
www.pbs.org.</TE>
<TE>   People 62 or older can get a lifetime Golden Age Passport for $10.
The passport will admit seniors and family members traveling in the
same vehicle to all national parks, monuments, recreation areas and
historic sites that charge an entry fee. Get the pass at any national
park or recreation area that charges admission. Don't forget to take
proof of age, such as a driver's license.</TE>
<TE>   How about a condo rental? For the first time, families can enjoy
the benefits of RCI Holiday Network time-share condos without the
commitment. Some cost as little as $500 a week. Call (800) 730-9981
or visit www.rciholidaynetwork.com. ResortQuest also specializes in
resort condo rentals, many in beach communities and at discounted
rates. Call (877) 588-5800 or visit www.resortquest.com.</TE>
<TE>   If you plan to travel just after Labor Day or before the prime
summer season (in late June, for example), you can save big. The Web
site of the local chamber of commerce or visitors bureau in the town
where you're headed can put you in touch with real estate agents who
handle vacation rentals.</TE>
<TE>   Wherever you go, here are a few tips:</TE>
<TE>   * Choose a house (or several condos) with a pool, because young
children don't always like the ocean--though they love the sand.</TE>
<TE>   * Safety and convenience are vital. Nix any place that requires a
long hike to the sand or has a lot of steps, especially if there are
babies and toddlers along.</TE>
<TE>   * Think about taking a relative to help watch the kids so that the
parents get a break. Consider renting within a resort complex where
there will be some organized children's programs, giving parents and
grandparents the chance for some adult time.</TE>
<TE>   * Splurge on maid service. Nobody wants to spend vacation cleaning
up kids' messes.</TE>
<TE>   * Insist that everyone help with the shopping and the cooking.</TE>
<TE>   * Most important, keep that camera handy.</TE>

<LD>The people initiating charges against the rental car companies
clearly violated the terms and conditions of the rental agreement
("Big Brother May Be Watching You in Your Rental Car," Travel
Insider, Aug. 4). In plain English, they were stealing. The
deliberate misuse of these vehicles constitutes theft of service and
breach of contract. The rental car companies have a right to be
compensated for their vehicles' misuse.</LD>
<LD>   Is it unfair for the owners of rental vehicles to know their
whereabouts to protect their companies' interests and investments?
People who rent cars for legitimate reasons and adhere to the terms
of the agreement have nothing to worry about. However, some rent
vehicles to commit a crime. Rental vehicles were used in the 1995
Oklahoma City and 1993 World Trade Center bombings.</LD>
<LD>   In today's uncertain environment we must be vigilant about
security and safety issues. When properly used, global positioning
systems can be a valuable tool in thwarting criminal acts and
summoning assistance when needed. But more important, these systems
help keep people honest by holding them accountable for their
actions. Maybe we should be less paranoid and litigious and concern
ourselves more about being honest and doing the right thing.</LD>

<LD>Readers contemplating a trip to Le Chambon-sur-Lignon, France
("Tracing Tales of Heroism in the Auvergne," Aug. 4), might be
interested to know that a history museum will be inaugurated there on
June 13, 2003--one of the first museums on the rescue anywhere in the
world.</LD>
<LD>   The Chambon Foundation, which runs the temporary exhibition center
depicted in James Dannenberg's article, recently partnered with the
village not only to open the history museum but also to create an
area-wide living museum beginning in 2004.</LD>
<LD>   As I recounted in my 1989 feature documentary, "Weapons of the
Spirit," I am a Jew who had the good fortune to be born in the area
at that time to parents who found shelter and friendship there. It is
exciting that soon the memory of the Holocaust and the memory of the
righteous will be entwined forever in this historic village.</LD>

<TE>   I do not agree with Dannenberg that "the roads [in France] are
better than the drivers." In many ways the French drive better than
Angelenos. They keep to the right and only enter the middle lane to
pass. If you are merging onto a freeway, cars coming from behind will
change lanes or slow to let you in. In medieval villages the streets
are narrow, and people pull over to let others pass. They do drive
fast but seem to be in control.</TE>

<LD>   However, I do not accept that the 1921 British Everest expedition

unlikely and that the expedition's primary mission would be to map
the surrounding area and explore possible routes up the mountain.
This was accomplished, with significant help from George Mallory.</LD>

<BD></BD>
<DL>LONDON</DL>
<LD>It was an unusually hot August afternoon by English standards, and I
was beginning to regret our decision to join the nobility. Sweat
streamed down my neck. Next to me, my husband, Frank, was fanning
himself with his program; at my other side, our 9-year-old daughter,
Marina, shaded her eyes from the sun.</LD>
<LD>   On the stage in front of us, Shakespeare's Macbeth had just come
face to face with the three witches.</LD>
<LD>   "Mommy," said Marina, turning to squint at me, "I think we should
go down and join the groundlings in the shade." In Shakespeare's era,
"groundlings" were people who watched the show from the open yard in
front of the stage, while richer people sat in more expensive seats
in the covered galleries.</LD>
<TE>   That afternoon we were in the lower gallery of Shakespeare's Globe
Theatre, a replica of the roofless playhouse where the Bard and his
troupe of actors first performed his plays 400 years ago. After much
debate, we had bought tickets where we could sit and watch like
noblemen. It hadn't occurred to us that the afternoon sun would beat
down on the gallery seats, while much of the yard was in cool shadow.
Belatedly we realized it wasn't the nobility but the workers and
riffraff who had the best deal. We quickly shifted our class
allegiance and joined the groundlings.</TE>
<TE>   Our family had talked about seeing a play here ever since the new
Globe Theatre opened in 1997. When we vacationed in England last
August, the Globe was one of our first stops during a week that aimed
to explore London and please a 9-year-old at the same time.</TE>
<TE>   If you're looking for a city to visit with children, London is
close to ideal. There are enough attractions, historical and
cultural--not to mention shopping opportunities--to keep kids happy
for weeks. There are fun things to do around every corner, from
riding on double-decker buses to watching the changing of the guard
at Buckingham Palace to scouting out the animals at the London Zoo.</TE>
<TE>   For our family, Shakespeare was a priority. We'd introduced Marina
to his work at an early age with a children's animated video
adaptation of "A Midsummer Night's Dream." Some people raise an
eyebrow at this; they think Shakespeare isn't appropriate for
children. But we've found that his vivid sense of fantasy and joyful
games with the English language make many of his plays appealing to
kids.</TE>
<TE>   During Shakespeare's era, plays were entertainment for
everyone--rich and poor, educated and illiterate. And those audiences
didn't sit in the dark in hushed silence. People jostled each other,
shouted and sometimes even threw tomatoes at actors. "Will we get to
throw tomatoes?" Marina had asked hopefully.</TE>
<TE>   For better or worse, no tomatoes were flying at the matinee we
attended. But director Tim Carroll and the actors of the Globe's Red
Company made things lively. The three witches, wearing bow ties and
black-rimmed glasses, danced to a cocktail party jazz band. Lady
Macbeth, a socialite in a silver Spandex gown and clip-on earrings,
kicked off her pumps on arriving home.</TE>
<TE>   As for Macbeth, he was a driven, Tony Blair-era yuppie. This
husband and wife made the perfect Clintonian couple. "We shall not
fail!" she shouted into the padded shoulder of his suit. Marina, who
had expected doublets and colored hose, was taken aback. "What year
is this set in?" she asked at the end of the first scene.</TE>
<TE>   After the show we had an early pasta dinner at the on-site Globe
Cafe, enjoying the view of St. Paul's Cathedral, then strolled along
the Thames on the Bankside promenade. Our child-friendly nightcap was
a visit to Garfunkel's restaurant near Trafalgar Square for hot
sticky toffee pudding with English custard. Marina pronounced this
the best dessert ever and plotted several more visits to the
family-oriented chain during our stay.</TE>
<TE>   Although Shakespeare's London ranked high on our list of places to
go and things to do, we squeezed other kid-friendly destinations into
our itinerary too.</TE>
<TE>   Marina chose to visit Hamley's six-story extravaganza of a toy
store instead of the Tower of London, which was fine with us, since
we had toured the Tower before. If you've never been there, it can be
a memorable experience for adults and older children. The
Tower--begun in 1078 by William the Conqueror and expanded by
successive rulers over the years--is notorious for its history as a
prison. Yeoman warders, or beefeaters, in splendid red coats and
white ruffs, delight in telling stories about historic figures who
met their fate here. Children may want to see the crown jewels,
displayed in the jewel house, and keep an eye out for the six famous
ravens, official residents of the Tower. A visit to the Tower can
take the better part of a day because there's usually a long line to
get in, an hour's guided tour and assorted diversions.</TE>
<TE>   Many kids will want to see the changing of the guard at Buckingham
Palace--or at least part of the hourlong ceremony. Dressed in their
red jackets, white epaulets and tall black fur hats, the guards are
most fascinating for what they will never do: shift their weight
while standing at attention, break their rigid, straight-ahead gaze
or, of course, smile. Children love to try to distract them by
waving, jumping or making funny faces.</TE>
<TE>   St. Paul's Cathedral is another good stop on a kids' tour of
London, largely thanks to the long climb--521 steps that lead up to
the viewing gallery. After all, who younger than 12 could resist
counting stairs while going up ... two at a time? The
cathedral--designed by Christopher Wren and built during the late
17th century--offers fabulous views of London from the top. Best of
all, halfway up the inside of the dome is the Whispering Gallery,
where kids can whisper messages from one side of the dome clear
across to the other.</TE>
<TE>   Three centuries newer, and decidedly more high-tech, is British
Airways' London Eye. Rising 450 feet over the River Thames, it's
billed as the world's highest "observation wheel" because, unlike a
traditional Ferris wheel, it revolves at a slow, stately pace. The
Eye also offers spectacular views of the city.</TE>
<TE>   Marina loved the intimate little Sherlock Holmes Museum, at 221b
Baker St., a former Victorian boardinghouse that's been set up to
look like the fictional Holmes abode. She liked running through
Kensington Gardens, across the street from our hotel, where a statue
of Peter Pan stands. And she enjoyed the Science Museum; she's still
talking about its cool space simulators, designed to train
astronauts.</TE>
<TE>   The Shakespeare connections ranked at the top of the list for our
family, though.</TE>
<TE>   After the Globe, we made sure we saw the Royal National Theatre, a
three-playhouse complex in South Bank. We took a backstage tour, saw
the National's 1,080-seat Olivier Theatre and learned about Laurence
Olivier's involvement in its planning and design before his death in
1989. We visited the carpentry shop, where sets are built and
fireproofed, and the props department, where crocodiles and latex
chickens were stacked next to wood spears and Gypsy wagons.</TE>
<TE>   That night we returned to the National to see "A Winter's Tale" at
the Olivier. I worried that Marina might fall asleep or--worse for
us--fidget with boredom. Maybe director Nicholas Hytner shared some
of my apprehension because he went all out with the staging. Act 1
was set in an upscale modern living room and played like "All My
Children" elevated to Greek drama. Act 2 seemed to pay homage to the
1968 Broadway musical "Hair" and featured a Woodstock-like
sheep-shearing festival and hippies camped out in tents. Marina was
riveted.</TE>
<TE>   British directors seem to be working hard to make Shakespeare
accessible to everyone. And judging by what we saw at the Globe and
the National, they're on the right track. Audiences love it. Some
Shakespeare buffs raised on Olivier and John Gielgud may wonder
whether depth hasn't been sacrificed, but by reaching out to a broad
audience, British theater seems to have assured itself a vibrant
future.</TE>
<TE>   Next we journeyed to the place where it all
began--Stratford-upon-Avon. Of course, some people argue that the
plays were not actually written by the "Bard of Avon" but by
Christopher Marlowe or one of several other likely suspects. But for
most of us these are the plays of Shakespeare, and Stratford is the
town he came from. Anne Hathaway's thatched cottage, the most
charming of the Shakespeare landmarks, is set among gardens and
orchards in the village of Shottery, a mile from Stratford. At 26,
Anne was still living here with her parents, successful farmers, when
18-year-old Will came courting. They married in 1582, and six months
later Anne gave birth to their first child.</TE>
<TE>   "Mommy, what's a shotgun wedding?" Marina asked when the house
guide had finished her thumbnail history. The story of William
Shakespeare and Anne Hathaway, I decided, was not such a bad
introduction to the subject.</TE>
<TE>   One of the many mysteries of Shakespeare's life is why he abruptly
left Stratford and his family a few years later, after Anne gave
birth to twins. Some say he was running from the law, because he had
recently been charged with poaching. But I've always thought that
having three babies and an older wife must have been daunting at his
age. Maybe, I said to Marina, Shakespeare realized he still wasn't
quite grown up and he needed some time. Whatever his reason for
leaving Stratford, it was a fateful choice. It's not clear what
happened to him in the intervening years, but by 1592 he was well
ensconced in London's theatrical world.</TE>
<TE>   We hopped on the red sightseeing bus that loops past the major
Stratford landmarks, heading for the house of Mary Arden,
Shakespeare's mother, then into town to Shakespeare's birthplace.
From the top deck of the bus we gazed over the hedgerows at green and
gold farmland, imagining we were the Ardens' country neighbors. Any
moment, it seemed, a ragtag band of traveling players might appear,
preparing to set up their stage.</TE>
<TE>   The entrance to Shakespeare's birthplace on Henley Street is
disappointing. Years before, Frank and I had made our pilgrimage,
expecting an ancient, magical door. Instead we found a large, modern
facade, looking much like a suburban post office. It is necessary to
pass through this, the ticket office and Shakespeare exhibition hall,
to arrive at the place where Will was born in 1564.</TE>
<TE>   To our surprise, everything inside had changed since our last
visit in the 1980s. Gone were the bare white walls and few austere
pieces of furniture that had suggested the Shakespeare family led a
spartan existence. In their place was a riot of color. Boldly painted
black, gold and blue linen covered the walls. The canopy bed where
Shakespeare was born sported red and green curtains. Candles burned
on night tables, and elegant shoes were laid out as if the owners
were about to step into them. "It seems like he's still living here,"
Marina said.</TE>
<TE>   The new decor, the guide said, is based on recent research. The
Shakespeares were prosperous, and the redesign reflects that. The
curators of the Shakespeare Birthplace seem to have been thinking
about the playwright and his modern audience. And perhaps they've
been influenced by projects like Colonial Williamsburg that bring the
past to life in a way that makes it real, even to children.</TE>
<TE>   We wandered out of the playwright's house and down Church Street,
past the half-timbered 15th century building where he attended
grammar school. It had been raining, and puddles filled the streets.
Just off Mill Lane is Trinity Church, where Shakespeare lies buried.</TE>
<TE>   It was almost dusk, and clouds were scattering above the River
Avon, which flows at the churchyard's edge. We walked down to the
water and watched swans propel themselves upstream, scanning the
water for bugs. The sky above the Avon turned pink and then lavender.
"I wish we could stay in Stratford just awhile longer," said Marina
as we headed for the car.</TE>
<TE>   Then, without skipping a beat, she added, "But I can't wait to get
back to London. I wish we could stay there forever."</TE>

<CP>PHOTO: "They were like brothers," says Newport Beach reader
Carlos Navarrete of these two Cuban men he encountered in Havana
Vieja, or Old Havana, a couple of years ago. Navarrete isn't sure the
pair really fought with revolutionaries such as Camilo Cienfuegos and
Ernesto "Che" Guevara (whose image appears on one of their hats), as
they claimed. But after a long, colorful chat in Spanish, Navarrete
was convinced of their love for their homeland. They were "very proud
of their culture, their history," he says. "They always expressed
pride in their country, even when acknowledging the flaws in their
government."</CP>

<LD>If the palaces, temples and beaches of Thailand are on your list of
destinations to see, you might want to check out a couple of low-cost
fall trips being organized by a San Francisco travel agency.</LD>
<LD>   Thailand, or Siam as it was called until 1939, is one of Asia's
most popular tourist destinations. The two seven-night packages, one
at $999 per person and the other at $1,199 per person, explore the
nation's most commonly visited regions. Both are available from Sept.
1 to Nov. 30.</LD>
<LD>   The $999 tour includes four nights in Bangkok, known for its
canals, cultural heritage and 400 glittering temples, and three
nights in Phuket, a resort area visited most often for its beaches,
shopping and night life. It includes an excursion to the Grand Palace
and Emerald Buddha in Bangkok.</LD>
<TE>   The $1,199 itinerary visits Chiang Rai, Chiang Mai and the Golden
Triangle region, where Myanmar (formerly Burma), Laos and Thailand
meet at a wide bend in the Mekong River. While in Chiang Rai,
travelers will stay at the Dusit Island Resort, taking tours that
include an elephant camp and elephant ride, a Mae Kok River boat trip
and a visit to the hill tribes.</TE>
<TE>   Included: round-trip flight on China Air from Los Angeles or San
Francisco to Bangkok, seven nights in hotels, all transfers within
Thailand, tours, breakfasts and service charges. Both packages
require double occupancy.</TE>

<TE>   Antarctica: By Ship</TE>
<TE>   Explore the Antarctic Peninsula--kayaking among towering icebergs,
camping out on the ice, taking a dip into thermal waters at the
bottom of the world--on nine-and 10-night winter expeditions.</TE>
<TE>   The trips, planned for Dec. 20 and Feb. 26, are aboard the
110-passenger Peregrine Mariner. Both tours begin at Ushuaia, at the
southern tip of Argentina, and sail through the South Shetland
Islands to the Antarctic Peninsula. Shore excursions, aboard Zodiac
rafts, will be made at several islands known for their history and
wildlife.</TE>
<TE>   Polar photographer David McGonigal will accompany both tours, with
photo excursions planned to help hobbyists. McGonigal was the
principal photographer for "Antarctica and the Arctic--the Complete
Encyclopedia" (Firefly Press, 2001).</TE>
<TE>   The itinerary varies according to weather, but the focus will be
on areas with the greatest promise of wildlife colonies. Penguins,
seals and whales are commonly seen.</TE>
<TE>   Cost: from $4,690 per person, double occupancy, for the nine-night
tour, including transportation from Ushuaia to the Antarctic
Peninsula, meals and shore excursions. Air fare add-on from Los
Angeles is about $1,500.</TE>

<HD>Going With the Flow in Hawaii</HD>
<DH>On the Big Island, crowds gather for a close-up view of
Pele's latest wrath as Kilauea volcano oozes fiery lava into the
Pacific Ocean</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>VANI RANGACHAR</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>HAWAII VOLCANOES NATIONAL PARK</DL>
<LD>It was almost like a twilight picnic before a rock concert. People
milled about carrying backpacks, coolers and baskets. Flashlight
beams swung in arcs across the path. Shouts, cheers and chatter added
to the carnival-like atmosphere.</LD>
<LD>   A young woman pulled a marshmallow from her knapsack, skewered it
with a stick and thrust it toward the orange glow. Roasting
marshmallows in a national park is hardly unusual, but this woman was
cooking hers over lava--scorching hot magma, molten rock--rising from
40 miles inside Earth.</LD>
<LD>   About 400 of us were gathered here on a Friday in mid-July to
watch the latest eruption of Kilauea, one of the most active
volcanoes in the world. As of press time Tuesday, the Mother's Day
Flow, named for May 12, the day it started, was still close enough
for spectators to make s'mores. But since my visit, the lava has
marched down to the sea--about a 20-minute walk from the end of Chain
of Craters Road, which was cut off by the flow, said Mardie Lane, a
ranger at Hawaii Volcanoes National Park. It is creating spectacular
vistas of dangerous, fiery spray as liquefied rock heated to 2,100
degrees oozes, drips and streams into the Pacific.</LD>
<TE>   It's been seven years since Kilauea treated the public to such a
close encounter. But because lava is notoriously fickle, experts
can't predict how long the Mother's Day Flow will continue. For now,
the spectacle is drawing thousands of locals and visitors--4,200 on
one recent night, according to a National Park Service tally.</TE>
<TE>   Kilauea has a long history of activity. In the last 50 years it
has erupted 34 times, and the Puu Oo cinder cone on its east
flank--the one causing the current fuss at the Mother's Day, Boundary
and HALP flows--has been spewing lava continually since 1983, adding
525 acres of grayish-black rock to the 4,021-square-mile Big Island.
(The HALP flow was named for a U.S. Geological Survey global
positioning system unit in the path of the lava.) The Mother's Day
Flow alone has created eight acres of new land since it hit the ocean
on July 19.</TE>
<TE>   This eruption of Kilauea was a bonus on my first visit to Hawaii.
My husband, Barry, his son, Jann, and I had come to Kapoho, a small
beach settlement on the less-touristed southeast coast about 30 miles
south of Hilo, as guests of Barry's sister Debbie Lapides; her
husband, Murray; and their 6-year-old daughter, Alexandra. The
Lapideses had rented an ocean-front house for the summer. We had
nothing more remarkable planned than the usual vacation activities:
bodysurfing at Waipio Beach on the northeastern side of the island,
snorkeling with green sea turtles and lazing in a hammock while
sipping POG, a mix of passion fruit, orange and guava juices.</TE>
<TE>   During our weeklong stay, we learned that there's more to this
place than just the bliss of its beaches. You can get an astronomy
lesson on Mauna Kea, one of the world's tallest volcanoes; sleep on
Kilauea's rim, hike its caldera and poke around a creepy cave; and
even have a sophisticated meal in a town called--what else?--Volcano.</TE>
<TE>   The Big Island's location makes it a bubbling caldron of volcanic
superlatives. The southernmost of Hawaii's major islands, it sits on
a magma spout in the center of the Pacific plate and the "Ring of
Fire," a misshapen line of volcanic activity that encircles the
Pacific Ocean.</TE>
<TE>   The island is home to the world's tallest mountain, Mauna Kea
--32,000 feet if you measure from its base on the sea floor--and the
most massive one, Mauna Loa, at 10,000 cubic miles. But Kilauea,
rising 4,200 feet just a few miles northeast of where we stood, is
the star of the island, the most temperamental and the one drawing
crowds.</TE>
<TE>   We started our volcanic explorations at Mauna Kea, Kilauea's
dormant sister, a rust-colored mountain slightly northeast of the
center of the island. Astronomers adore Mauna Kea, which rises far
from light-polluting cities and where clouds stay well below the
summit.</TE>
<TE>   On the volcano's summit ridge, 11 nations operate 11
state-of-the-art telescopes, some of the world's most powerful.</TE>
<TE>   We had driven up from Hilo on Saddle Road, which bisects the Big
Island and straddles Mauna Kea to the north and Mauna Loa, its more
active and shorter--by 119 feet--sister peak to the south. Most major
rental car companies don't allow two-wheel-drive cars on Saddle Road,
presumably because of its rough condition. We were in Murray's
four-wheel-drive Pathfinder (he had had shipped it from the mainland
to avoid the cost of renting a car), and we found the road passable.</TE>
<TE>   The unsigned turn for the road up Mauna Kea is easy to miss, and
we did, but we retraced our path, found the turn and began the steep
climb. We kept an eye on the car's heat gauge as the needle nosed
into the danger zone.</TE>
<TE>   After an hourlong stop at the visitors center to acclimate to the
altitude, Barry, Murray and I climbed back into the Pathfinder.
(Debbie and the kids stayed at the center; children 16 and younger
and people with cardiac and respiratory problems are advised to stay
off the summit because its oxygen-scarce air can pose health risks.)</TE>
<TE>   The view from atop Mauna Kea is spectacular. To the northeast is
the somnolent peak of Haleakala, 75 miles away on neighboring Maui,
and in all other directions the Pacific. Below are the surreal rust
tones of a treeless landscape that could have been painted by
Salvador Dali.</TE>
<TE>   While Murray waited by the observatories to fight off
altitude-induced dizziness, Barry and I took a mercifully short hike
to the true peak at 13,796 feet, fighting a chilling gale. We had
worn fleece jackets, long pants and hats, but I longed for gloves.
(Who brings those to Hawaii?) The wind roared in my ears, tore my hat
off and almost sent me tumbling down the mountain. I wasn't surprised
to learn later that Mauna Kea's tip is often covered in snow and even
has blizzards in winter.</TE>
<TE>   As lovely as the view was, the show at the visitors center, where
we had left Debbie and the kids, makes a trek to Mauna Kea
worthwhile. The Onizuka Center for International Astronomy is one
room of marginally interesting displays, videos and interactive
computers, along with the usual souvenirs, snacks and concessions.
But hang around till nightfall, because that's when the heavens
reveal their glory.</TE>
<TE>   Volunteers and staffers set up powerful telescopes outside and
train their sights on a sky so blurry with stars that it is hard to
distinguish one constellation from another. They pointed out Venus
low in the evening sky, Polaris, Scorpio and the Southern Cross, a
constellation usually seen below the equator. Erik Rau, a guide,
showed us the biggest star cluster in the Milky Way. Omega Centauri
has more than 5 million stars, he said, and the light we were seeing
left its source nearly 17,000 years ago.</TE>
<TE>   Several companies on the Big Island operate daylong trips from
Kailua Kona and Hilo to Mauna Kea, and from the snatches of lectures
I heard, the guides seemed knowledgeable. But why pay $75 a person, I
reasoned, if you can get the same show for free?</TE>
<TE>   After the strenuous trip to the top of Hawaii, we decided on a
cushier expedition for our next exploration. Leaving the family and
kids behind, Barry and I drove up to Hawaii Volcanoes National Park
for a night at the fire-engine-red Volcano House.</TE>
<TE>   I've learned over the years that the National Park Service puts
hotels in some fabulous locations, and the 42-room Volcano House is
no exception. It's perched at 4,000 feet on the lip of Kilauea, and
the view from our room overlooking the home of Pele, the Hawaiian
volcano goddess, was fascinating--a flat crater, formed when the
volcano collapsed, with wisps of smoke rising from cracks.</TE>
<TE>   A small fire burned in the lobby's large lava-stone fireplace when
we arrived on a warm afternoon. Windows flanked the fireplace, and a
row of honey-colored koa wood rockers stood in front of it. Our room
had a koa rocker too, and, in place of a TV, a shelf of bestsellers.
If I'd had a week here, I could easily have curled up in a rocker, a
Hawaiian quilt on my lap, watching the sun play off the crater.</TE>
<TE>   After drinks at the Volcano House bar, where we had a view of
Kilauea, we left for dinner at the 12-room Kilauea Lodge in nearby
Volcano, a village of about 1,400.</TE>
<TE>   When I saw the sign that read "Please check in your car for
curious cat" in the lodge's parking lot, I was so charmed that the
quality of the meal wouldn't have mattered to me. (Barry, who has
higher standards, just rolled his eyes.) But the meal, from starter
to dessert, deserved accolades, especially my entree--ono, Hawaii's
ubiquitous white fish, with capers--and Barry's appetizer of celery
soup with macadamia nuts. The dish that made the trip, though, was
the coconut cake, so airy and flavorful that I would fly back in a
New York minute for another slice.</TE>
<TE>   Finding a sophisticated meal in such a small town surprised us,
but there were other treats awaiting in tiny Volcano and the national
park.</TE>
<TE>   Our plan the next morning was to hike down into Kilauea crater,
join Jann and the Lapideses in Volcano for lunch and return to the
park for more geologic explorations.</TE>
<TE>   The five-mile hike was relatively easy, the trail taking us down
about 400 feet through a rain forest on the nearly vertical sides of
Kilauea Iki (Little Kilauea) crater. We brushed against hapuu ferns
twice as tall as my 5-foot-3 frame and yellow mamane blooming by the
trail. I was on the lookout for a nene, the native Hawaiian goose and
the state bird. I saw none, but Khalij pheasants, a game bird
introduced to the island's ecosystem, were plentiful.</TE>
<TE>   Then the forest abruptly disappeared, and we stood on the edge of
the caldera floor, staring at a barren plain of black rock, thrust
into rough angles in some places, as smooth as obsidian in others.</TE>
<TE>   In 1959 this was a pond of percolating lava. Slender reeds of
steam rising from cracks reminded me that only a few feet beneath my
hiking boots, the earth was hot enough to boil water. And just a few
miles east, Kilauea was alive with streams of molten rock.</TE>
<TE>   I didn't think anything could grow in such a tortured landscape,
but proving nature's tenacity were the red-tufted blossoms of the
native ohia lehua brightening the bleakness.</TE>
<TE>   Our hike took two hours at a leisurely pace, leaving us only a
half-hour to check out the nonprofit Volcano Art Center, next to the
national park visitors center, before lunch. The 12-room gallery,
housed in the first Volcano House hotel (built in 1877), is
chockablock with jewelry, pottery, paintings, sculptures, ceramics
and furniture crafted by Hawaiian artists.</TE>
<TE>   I really wanted to buy some koa furniture, but Barry looked so
pained at the prices that I settled for koa salad tongs. With
shopping rapidly turning into an exercise in frustration, we left the
gallery to meet the rest of the family.</TE>
<TE>   We worked off our lunch of burgers and sandwiches at the Lava Rock
Cafe with several quick hikes in the park: the half-mile Devastation
Trail; another half-miler past reeking sulfur vents; and through
Thurston lava tube, formed when surface lava cooled and hardened but
magma continued to flow through an underground tunnel.</TE>
<TE>   The tube was like walking in a long, narrow cave. Half the tube is
illuminated, but our band of explorers decided to continue into an
unlighted adjacent tube. The ground underfoot grew uneven, and the
tube damper and creepier, so I proposed we turn back.</TE>
<TE>   "I am not afraid," Alexandra said. I wasn't about to be outdone by
a 6-year-old, so we continued until black walls closed in on us.</TE>
<TE>   When we surfaced, it was time for the grand finale to our
primordial odyssey, so we joined the line of cars on Chain of Craters
Road, the highway that leads south from Kilauea's caldera about 20
miles to the sea. When we arrived next to the sea it was sunset, the
most popular time at the flow, so we had to park almost a mile from
the road's end, which was closed off by the lava flow.</TE>
<TE>   Carrying cooler and picnic necessities, we joined the human chain
moving over a path marked by yellow reflectors fastened to the lava.</TE>
<TE>   We settled ourselves on a crumbly lava mound, passed around
sandwiches and sushi, and watched as molten rock streams ebbed,
flowed and changed course. Some of the visitors poked and probed
within a foot of the lava holes, patches of orange peppering the
black landscape. Less than a half-mile away, ethereal lava streaked a
darkened cliff.</TE>
<TE>   A woman screamed when she fell and cut herself on the lava. Barry
felt her pain. Earlier in the week he had stumbled on a lava flow and
sliced open his hand and thigh and scraped a few layers off his shin.
Lava, I found out later, is about half silica, so landing on it is
like falling on shards of glass.</TE>
<TE>   I leaned against my backpack and stared at the sky, picking out
constellations I had learned to recognize three nights before, then
looked back at the ridge. The crowd blurred into background, leaving
me to contemplate, in silence and awe, the birth of new land.</TE>

<TE>   When to Go, What to Take</TE>
<TE>   You can get within a few feet of the lava on the Big Island, but
because nature is often unpredictable, there's an element of danger.</TE>
<TE>   The most popular time to see the flow is at sunset, when the line
of cars parked along Chain of Craters Road can stretch for two miles.
Mardie Lane, a ranger at Hawaii Volcanoes National Park, advises
visitors to go at sunrise, when the sights are just as spectacular
but the crowds are smaller.</TE>
<TE>   If you're going to see the Mother's Day Flow, the park service
says visitors should:</TE>
<TE>   * Wear sensible shoes. Lava fields are uneven with cracks and
fissures. As we learned firsthand, it's painfully sharp if you fall.</TE>
<TE>   * Take a flashlight. Though the lava is bright, it's not bright
enough to illuminate your way after dark.</TE>
<TE>   * Take plenty of drinking water. The radiant heat off the flow
combined with high temperatures and humidity can dehydrate you
quickly.</TE>
<TE>   * Stay out of the steam plume that's caused by superheated lava
hitting the ocean. The steam contains hydrochloric acid and minute
particles of glass, which can sting your eyes and skin. If you have
respiratory problems, it can be deadly.</TE>
<TE>   * Stay off the new land created by the flow. It's unstable and
could break off.</TE>
<TE>   * Watch out for centipedes. Their bites can cause discomfort and
swelling, and anaphylactic reactions in allergic people.</TE>

<DH>Mia Farrow plays a working mom whose teen daughter raids
the medicine cabinet in 'The Secret Life of Zoey.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SUSAN KING</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Lifetime's latest movie, "The Secret Life of Zoey," is a cautionary
tale about teen drug abuse. It didn't start that way. Originally, the
drama, premiering Monday, was strictly intended to be about divorce.</LD>
<LD>   "I always thought how rotten it was for kids to have to go through
divorce," says executive producer Patricia Clifford, who has been
happily married "for a long time." Her 17-year-old daughter often
told her of friends who had a rough time coping with being shuttled
from one parent's home to the other's.</LD>
<LD>   But when one of those conversations veered into the realm of drugs
and how common it was for teens to take prescription medicines from
their parents' bathrooms, Clifford shifted the movie's focus.</LD>
<TE>   "They are swapping them at school and selling them at parties,"
Clifford says. "Ritalin was a huge favorite. It would keep them up at
night while they were doing homework."</TE>
<TE>   And the parents, she says, are more often than not oblivious to
their kids' drug abuse because the constant moving between homes
makes it difficult to keep track of them.</TE>
<TE>   In the drama, Zoey (Julia Whelan) follows the pattern of being
deceitful to her parents. A bright, studious 16-year-old, she is
nevertheless angry and pained by their divorce. Her mother, Marcia
(Mia Farrow), is working part time as a receptionist at a beauty
salon and is looking for a full-time job. Marcia is taking
antidepressants to cope with the situation and anti-inflammatory
medication to ease chronic neck pain; Zoey thus is able to get drugs
from the medicine cabinet. She also raids the supply of painkillers
belonging to her father (Cliff DeYoung)--all as a means to escape a
less-than-perfect life.</TE>
<TE>   Her problems get worse when a new boy at school (Michael
Coristine) suggests she try Ecstasy and recommends shoplifting to pay
for it. Eventually, of course, Zoey's habit catches up with her and
she is entered into the local hospital's substance abuse program.</TE>
<TE>   Though Farrow is the mother of 14 children, she didn't take the
film because of its subject matter. What drew her was its director,
Robert Mandel. "He did a movie I really liked called 'Independence
Day,' " she says. That 1983 film, which starred Kathleen Quinlan and
also featured DeYoung, dealt with spousal abuse.</TE>
<TE>   "I read the script and, in his hands, I thought it had a shot. It
was not an uninteresting story, and I was right to work with him. I
did have a terrific time." But Farrow admits she hasn't seen the
final project and probably won't. The 57-year-old actress never
watches herself on screen: "It's not fun."</TE>
<TE>   She says none of her brood has had a drug problem. "My 17-year-old
daughter is still talking to me and is an angel, but I know it can
get really hairy," she says. "I was a handful as a teenager." In
fact, Farrow was barely out of her teens when she married Frank
Sinatra, who was 30 years her senior.</TE>
<TE>   One thing is for certain: Farrow never talked back to her
parents--the late director John Farrow and actress Maureen
O'Sullivan--the way Zoey does to hers in the movie. "I was afraid of
my father until the day he died," Farrow admits. "While I wasn't
afraid of my mother, I never said a disrespectful word to her in my
whole life."</TE>
<TE>   Though the film primarily deals with teens and drugs, it also
shines the spotlight on the problems middle-age women have when they
find themselves suddenly divorced and entering the workforce.</TE>
<TE>   "I have friends who are in a similar position," Farrow says. "You
give up your career and you raise a child and everyone acknowledges
and respects that, and suddenly the child is 16 and the husband
leaves for a younger woman and it is hard to pull a life together.
You have a very difficult young woman in the house and the husband is
gone and you have to pull together a career out of thin air. You have
to be resourceful."</TE>
<TE>   "The Secret Life of Zoey" can be seen Monday at 9 p.m. on
Lifetime. The network has rated it TV-14-L (may not be appropriate
for viewers younger than 14, with an advisory for language).</TE>

<HD>Leave Beach Ads to the FAA</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>There's a fight brewing between oceanfront cities that view
banner-towing aircraft as ear-and eyesores and the Federal Aviation
Administration, which traditionally has regulated civilian aviation.
But it's a battle that local governments most likely should and will
lose.</LD>
<LD>   For most beachgoers, the low-flying aircraft that tow beer,
telephone calling card and automobile advertisements are as much a
part of the beach scene as gliding sailboats and pounding surf.
Others, including those lucky enough to live along the coast, view
the aerial advertising assault as a noisy and unwanted bother.</LD>
<LD>   The regulatory debate was sparked by a federal appeals court
ruling in February that upheld a Honolulu ordinance that prohibits
aerial advertising above its postcard-perfect beaches. Now a
Huntington Beach councilwoman is proposing a similar regulation that
would prohibit low-flying banner flights over Surf City beaches.</LD>
<TE>   A beachfront ban probably would be a death knell for many
banner-towing pilots in Southern California. Most banner-towing
operations are small businesses, and many were hit hard after Sept.
11 when the FAA slapped strict limits on pilots flying over stadiums
and other busy facilities.</TE>
<TE>   The FAA doesn't look kindly on other agencies horning in on its
turf. Its regulations prohibit aircraft from flying below 1,000 feet,
but the agency regularly grants waivers to banner pilots. The FAA
hints that it will end regulatory confusion by eliminating a rule
that requires pilots flying at lower altitudes to abide by local laws
and ordinances--effectively shutting municipalities out.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. Aerial Advertisers Assn., a trade group formed after
Sept. 11, argues against local government intervention. It points to
a Colorado Supreme Court decision that the "property interests" of
earthbound consumers don't extend into the sky.</TE>
<TE>   The banner-towing group maintains that local regulations will lead
to confusion. What if Huntington Beach prohibits low-flying aircraft
but neighboring Newport Beach does not? Would ordinances aimed at
banner-towing aircraft prevent the Goodyear blimp from flying
overhead?</TE>
<TE>   Consumers are hit with an estimated 3,000 marketing messages
daily, ranging from radio jingles and billboards to apparel logos and
banner ads--both online and in the sky. So it's easy to commiserate
with those whose solitude is interrupted by the drone of
banner-towing aircraft.</TE>
<TE>   But using city ordinances to force banner-towing aircraft from the
skies isn't the right solution. The FAA is charged with controlling
the nation's airspace. The agency should work with local governments
to set limits that protect pilots' livelihoods as well as those who
object to the aerial ad assault.</TE>

<LD>Environmentalists consider Saddleback Meadows as the Freddie Krueger
of development projects--the mean-spirited bad guy who won't die.</LD>
<LD>   A development plan that surfaced 20 years ago fizzled after the
landowner went bankrupt. A subsequent plan floated by a new owner
sparked angry lawsuits that delayed development. A $12.2-million plan
to buy and preserve the 230-acre tract unexpectedly collapsed amid
angry finger-pointing by environmentalists and the developer.</LD>
<LD>   Now, Orange County planners are reviewing a development plan that
would allow 299 homes to be built in the foothills of the Santa Ana
Mountains.</LD>
<TE>   The unique Southern California property sets developers to
drooling and makes environmentalists see red when development is
proposed.</TE>
<TE>   The tract is the only link between two conservation districts
encompassing tens of thousands of acres of open land dotted with
vernal pools, coastal sage-scrub and oak trees. Such rare and
endangered species as gnatcatchers, fairy shrimp and the cactus wren
call it home, as does wildlife using it as a backwoods highway.</TE>
<TE>   Twenty years of constant bickering and lawsuits is enough. Orange
County should serve as an effective broker between developers and
environmentalists. This is an important wildlife corridor in the
Trabuco Canyon area. But it's also land that, the county
acknowledges, probably will see some form of development.</TE>
<TE>   Exactly what level of development is the question that the county
hasn't responsibly answered. Two decades ago, the county approved
plans for a mind-boggling 705 mobile homes. Three years ago, the
county approved a plan for 299 homes--only to have a court toss out
its environmental studies.</TE>
<TE>   The developer now threatens to build the 705 mobile homes if its
latest plan isn't approved. Environmentalists huff that the developer
is bluffing. The burden now shifts to the county, which must fashion
a plan that protects the land and, absent a buyout by
preservationists, lets the developer move forward on a reasonable
project.</TE>
<TE>   Orange County has an environmentally sophisticated populace that
views overdevelopment as a threat. Too often, environmentalists
embrace an all-or-nothing stance and developers forget that good
land-use planning includes impacts on neighboring land.</TE>
<TE>   It's high time the county looked at the big picture and used its
considerable power to craft a sensible solution. This isn't an issue
that should, once again, land in the courts.</TE>

<LD>It's always sad when government forgets that its main job is supposed
to be serving the public. Somehow, Laguna Niguel City Hall got
matters twisted around and is convinced its duty lies in protecting
real estate sales.</LD>
<LD>   The city is pushing a bill, SB 1500, that would change the
disclosures that homeowners in landslide zones must make when selling
property. Here's what a state Senate analysis says about the bill
that's supported solely by Laguna Niguel and the state Board of
Realtors:</LD>
<LD>   "Laguna Niguel states that it is concerned that the owners of
residential property ... will be required to disclose, upon sale of
their property, that property is located in a seismic landslide
hazard zone, which will adversely affect a prospective sale."</LD>
<TE>   The city's original idea was to change state maps showing seismic
hazards, eliminating any land where city-approved work had been done
to make the land safer. But remediation doesn't always mean property
owners are safe from hazards, as many residents throughout Orange
County have found at great personal cost after their houses cracked
or slipped down hillsides.</TE>
<TE>   That plan failed, so the bill was amended to tell prospective
buyers that, well, yes, this property is on the landslide map, but
work might have been done to fix that and you can go look up more
information on state documents or spend money to hire a geologist.</TE>
<TE>   The Department of Conservation, which puts out the maps, screamed
foul, pointing out that the documents are impenetrable to all but
experts, and that the information might have nothing to do with the
development in question. The agency also asks why people should spend
money for information that the local planning department should be
providing for free.</TE>
<TE>   Now the bill, which has reached Gov. Gray Davis' desk with a push
from the state Board of Realtors, has been amended again to tell
people that they also could go ask the city planning or building
department for more information.</TE>
<TE>   At this point, SB 1500 is a marginally acceptable bill. It's not
wrong to let people know that land might not be as hazardous as it
seems at first glance and direct them to more information. The maps
themselves are old and their reliability also has been challenged.</TE>
<TE>   Buying a home is a frighteningly expensive proposition these days,
yet many people put more consumer research into buying a car. Home
buyers need to get all the information they can before committing
most of their life's wages to a slice of land topped with stucco and
a tile roof.</TE>
<TE>   One of the main jobs of public agencies is to obtain and
disseminate good information, not to mention protect the common
welfare. Laguna Niguel City Hall would be properly stern if it
learned that a homeowner had done major renovation on a house without
required permits. The value of the house and the safety of its
residents rest on homeowners' giving that information to the city.
The city has the same responsibility to give information that affects
property values and safety back to the public.</TE>
<TE>   No other city in California has joined Laguna Niguel to support
this bill. No other city seems to have a problem giving consumers
public information even if it doesn't help local property values.</TE>
<TE>   Laguna Niguel needs to remember that it already has an important
job as a government. It doesn't need to moonlight as a real estate
agent.</TE>

<HD>Campaign Mail Limits Would Help Incumbents</HD>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Re "Return to Sender," Aug. 11:</LD>
<LD>   The Times' call for further controls on campaign mail is a cry for
censorship of political speech. The slate mailers you seek to banish
are often the only way non-wealthy candidates can afford to get their
message out. Restricting political giving and speech only helps
wealthy incumbents. Of seven countywide incumbents in the March
primary, six were reelected. Five ran opposed. Further campaign
controls will make county elections even more lopsided.</LD>
<LD>   Current restrictions are so skewed to protect incumbents that when
the rare challenger, such as myself, does win, some call for even
further controls on political mail. Now that I'll soon be an
incumbent myself, perhaps I shouldn't care, but freedom of speech
applies to all, including any future challengers I may have.</LD>
<TE>   The Times urges voters to throw away slate mailers "without so
much as a glance." Should we do the same with all the advertising
inserts that come with your newspaper? Voters, like consumers, need
more information, not less. Your newspaper is protected by the 1st
Amendment. Political candidates and contributors are entitled to the
same protections.</TE>

<TE>   4th District</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Re "Regulations on Slate Mailers Put a Muzzle on Free Speech,"
July 21:</TE>
<TE>   James Lacy criticized the county's adoption of a rule that would
regulate the content of slate mailers, which is not true, and he
failed to explain that the new rule seeks only to close a loophole in
the $1,000 contribution limit.</TE>
<TE>   In the recent election, more than a dozen slate mailers were
issued by the Voter Education Project, a slate mailer organization,
in which three of the four pages in each mailer featured Chris Norby
for supervisor. These mailers were in reality candidate campaign
literature produced by a slate mailer organization as a way to evade
the county's contribution limits.</TE>
<TE>   Normally a candidate pays for his own candidate literature. But
not in this case. Norby and his consultants coordinated the
production and distribution of these mailers with a slate mailer
organization, but the cost of these mailers was covered by a $440,000
payment from the anti-airport committee to the slate mailer
organization. By contributing to the slate mailer organization (which
is not regulated by the county's campaign ordinance) instead of
contributing directly to Norby (who is subject to the county's
campaign ordinance), the county's $1,000 contribution limit was
evaded.</TE>
<TE>   The recently adopted county regulation will close this loophole by
making candidates pay their fair share of a mailer. Further, nothing
in the rules controls or dictates the content of the mailer.</TE>
<TE>   Norby played and won by the rules of the game fair and square. The
new law seeks only to ensure that all candidates compete on a level
playing field. However, the old rules were no match for resourceful
political consultants.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Re "Bond Would Buy Out Developers," Aug. 4:</LD>
<LD>   The Bolsa Chica Land Trust has worked for 10 years to acquire and
preserve the entire 1,700-acre Bolsa Chica wetlands and mesas. Our
support of Proposition 50, the Water Security, Clean Drinking Water,
Coastal and Beach Protection Act of 2002, which will be on the
November ballot, is completely in tune with our efforts. The trust
was one of the first organizations to endorse the initiative.</LD>
<LD>   It is clear to us that the voices of land preservation in Orange
County too often fall on the deaf ears of Orange County supervisors,
as evidenced by their continued track record of approving every
development proposal for the Bolsa Chica. But now it is refreshing to
think that residents in our county and state can vote to do what the
supervisors could not: find an equitable alternative to development
on the Bolsa Chica mesa. With the passage of Proposition 50, funds
will be available to clean our beaches, make our water safe and
preserve such jewels as Bolsa Chica.</LD>
<TE>   The trust welcomes any organization or developer to join in seeing
that Proposition 50 is voted into law by the citizens of California.</TE>

<LD>Re "The Real Issue Is Revenue," Aug. 11:</LD>
<LD>   We have lived in Cypress since 1975 and want to publicly thank our
outstanding City Council for having the fortitude to fight off the
zealous Cottonwood Christian Center. It is not a waste of taxpayer
money to continue this fight, because our council is striving to keep
Cypress financially secure. That's why we elected them. Every day we
read stories of how lower-court rulings are overturned. It seems that
the judges at the low end of the spectrum make rulings contrary to
the law and higher-up courts correct their mistakes. And so this will
happen with this situation too. Please keep fighting, Cypress. While
a few people have signs that erroneously read "Please Don't Take
Cottonwood's Land," we would like a sign for our home that reads,
"Please Don't Take the Economic Future From Cypress."</LD>

<HD>O.C. Board Is Bullish Against Merrill Lynch</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Make no mistake, the Orange County Board of Supervisors was unanimous
in its opposition to using Merrill Lynch in any capacity whatsoever.
Any potential business relationship Merrill Lynch has in mind with
the county was outright rejected by all five supervisors.</LD>
<LD>   Taxpayers have been forced to cover more than $900 million needed
to bail the county out of bankruptcy as a result of the investment
strategy used by former county Treasurer Robert M. Citron and Merrill
Lynch. As I stated, I'm not remotely interested in input to our
financial investment strategy from either Citron or Merrill Lynch.
This action was a prudent and protective measure formalizing an
already unwritten policy between current Treasurer-Tax Collector John
M.W. Moorlach and this board. Now there can be no financial dealings
with Merrill Lynch by anyone without board action and public
discussion.</LD>
<LD>   I smile when I see Moorlach's stance on the matter. He has been in
my office lobbying me to reconsider my personal policy of "no
business with Merrill Lynch." He even tried to sway me by claiming I
would be the only supervisor not supportive of doing business with
the brokerage house. I stood firm then and still do now. Merrill
Lynch has no business in the county. Hopefully, Moorlach understands
now that there is clearly no support for Merrill Lynch on this board,
given the 5-0 vote against it.</LD>
<TE>   Thomas W. Wilson</TE>
<TE>   County Supervisor,</TE>
<TE>   5th District</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Although The Times printed a correction, readers deserve
clarification after the Aug. 14 report, "O.C. Renews Its Ties With
Merrill Lynch." Given the headline, readers now assume the county is
prepared to do business with Merrill Lynch. Quite the opposite.</TE>
<TE>   I carried this initiative to the Board of Supervisors to prevent
the county treasurer from utilizing Merrill Lynch's financial
services. The board unanimously agreed to prohibit him from using
Merrill Lynch without prior board approval. No one has forgotten
Merrill Lynch's role in the county's bankruptcy. In fact, the firm's
track record has not improved: a $100-million fine in New York, top
officials invoking the 5th Amendment before Congress in the Enron
scandal and the Martha Stewart insider-trading allegations.</TE>
<TE>   My advice to Merrill Lynch is not to take the headline or the
article to heart. We know our county treasurer is pitching your
products. However, not one member of the board is interested in
having you back in the county. Spend your energy and resources
cleaning up your corporate act. And by the way, you want to make a
good start? How about paying us back the $1 billion you owe the
citizens of our county, or maybe you can just cover our $93 million a
year in principal and interest payments.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Re "Sky Is the Limit for Beach Ads, Cities Say," Aug. 12:</LD>
<LD>   If the Huntington Beach City Council thinks it can win a case
against the FAA, it obviously hasn't done its homework. There have
been many cases in which a town or municipality has tried to alter
minimum altitudes for aircraft flying over the town, only to find,
after spending big bucks on legal fees, that the FAA and no one else
has jurisdiction over "controlled airspace." Gee, I wonder why it's
called "controlled" space?</LD>
<LD>   For a city that is always looking for revenue, it seems to me
Huntington Beach is missing a sure thing by not allowing banner
flyovers and charging an annual fee for a "flyover permit." At the
moment, the council is looking to make up more than $6 million in
lost revenue, and Aug. 1, the city administrator presented the
council a proposed budget with $3.5 million in cuts. So, don't think
that the council doesn't need the money.</LD>
<TE>   As for the noise factor, complainers can turn their attention to
the Huntington Beach Police Department's "no tail rotor" helicopter
that is supposed to be--but really isn't--quieter than a conventional
helicopter with a tail rotor.</TE>

<LD>Re "County to Fund Study of Military Museum," Aug. 8:</LD>
<LD>   I read with interest the idea of turning the Tustin airship hangar
into a military museum. This may be a good idea, but I have a better
one. Why not honor our veterans by reopening the El Toro commissary
for military veterans who were promised this?</LD>
<LD>   My husband retired from the Marines after 20 years. Why must we
drive to Camp Pendleton to get to a commissary? Other closed bases
have kept their commissaries open because they care about their
veterans. While all sides argue whether there should be a great park
or a golf course, our veterans go wanting. It is beyond belief that
the people of Orange County do not care about the active and retired
military. I believe that they do. My question to the county
supervisors and Irvine: Do you care?</LD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Re "Power Play: Big Energy vs. Solar," Aug. 11:</LD>
<LD>   The idea of paying customers lower, wholesale rates for energy
they produce during peak periods, then being charged full rates at
night when energy use is low, is unfair. The utilities' amendments to
AB 58 weaken the law by not crediting consumer's energy bill at the
same rate they pay the utility. Under the revised law someone could
easily end up paying money to the utilities for producing energy. Yet
the utilities have the gall to claim that it costs other ratepayers
money. How dumb do they think people are? After we got ripped off for
tens of billions of dollars with the energy deregulation scam,
politicians should not expect to get votes by being in the pockets of
the utilities.</LD>

<LD>Re "The Rush to Judge Avila," Dana Parsons, Aug. 11:</LD>
<LD>   As a person who was condemned before being charged, I find Dana
Parsons' comments on Alejandro Avila a fundamental defense of the
rights that our Constitution grants all citizens. As a professor of
criminology bluntly put it: "The sheriff's job is to catch people,
not to try them, convict them and sentence them.... This is a country
built on very important principles, and you just don't throw them to
the wind."</LD>
<LD>   Wisdom, not official hysteria, should guide the investigation of
an abhorrent crime. The hypocrisy of media-seeking is underscored if
you think about the hundreds of other child victims of similar crimes
that go unnoticed.</LD>

<HD>Debate Over El Toro Airport Continues Anew</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Re "2 Supervisors Propose a Fifth Ballot Measure on El Toro
Planning," Aug. 1:</LD>
<LD>   I am appalled by the lack of leadership being displayed by Orange
County Supervisors Chuck Smith and Cynthia P. Coad. The proposed
Measure B by Smith is an obvious attempt to resurrect the dead El
Toro airport option by usurping the powers of the city of Irvine. It
ignores the will of the people.</LD>
<LD>   Not only are they trying to destroy the recent diligent efforts of
the Navy, they are endangering our country by meddling with the
economic benefits the Navy will realize from its current proposed
land auction. These revenues are needed to fight the war on
terrorism. The current Navy plan will ensure maximum revenue to the
Department of Defense and strengthen our country.</LD>

<TE>   Re "Controversy Is Airborne Once Again Over El Toro," Aug. 11:</TE>
<TE>   Like Freddie Krueger, the serial killer in the ["Nightmare on Elm
Street"] movies, the El Toro airport won't stay dead no matter how
many stakes are put through its heart. At least Rex Ricks is honest
enough to admit that he would not want an airport in his backyard.
His letter refers to the "V-Plan"--meaning, I suppose, the
alternative design that avoids takeoffs downwind and uphill, as in
the county supervisors' proposal.</TE>
<TE>   That facts are that the only feasible flight path for fully loaded
takeoffs from El Toro would require a westerly route over Irvine and
Newport Beach. We already have an airport with a takeoff path into
the prevailing westerly sea breeze. It's called John Wayne Airport.
Most of the pro-airport letter writers express concern about the
"terrible shortage" of passenger capacity at John Wayne.</TE>
<TE>   Fine. I have a solution. Extend John Wayne's runways to the east
through the industrial parks until capacity is increased. If we need
more runways, extend [them] laterally into the areas north and south
of the airport. Of course, I always look at the address of the letter
writers because most of the pro-airport letters are from Newport
Beach and Costa Mesa. Somehow that reduces the credibility of their
advice. Both sides of this story are concerned about quality-of-life
issues. Major airports don't belong in residential areas. If we could
agree on that we might make some progress on a solution to all our
communities' problems.</TE>

<TE>   Re "El Toro Vote to Seek Full Navy Cleanup," Aug. 7:</TE>
<TE>   Of course, county supervisors voted unanimously to have county
voters vote on whether the Navy should spend billions to child-proof
an old airfield. Rather than converting the Marine Corps Air Station
at El Toro to its most logical (and cheapest, most efficient) use as
an airport, let's take years to sanitize the soil to make a park.
Meanwhile, all the other Southern California airports will experience
gridlock. The Navy should put a permanent fence around the acreage
and tell Orange County to come back with a plan that shows they can
play well with others.</TE>

<HD>Defending Water Official Accused of Conflict</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When the dust settles, the conflict-of-interest accusations against
Jerry King, president of the Orange County Water District board, will
prove unfounded. I know this because I have known Jerry for four
years, and I'd be hard pressed to find a more honorable, altruistic
man. He has spent countless hours working to represent the district's
interests.</LD>
<LD>   What is more heart-rending is that he and the board are under
attack because the majority of the board has [rejected] a proposal
for a commercial dude ranch behind the Prado Dam on land owned by the
water district. The proposed commercial enterprise on public lands is
simply incompatible with the sensitive habitat and wetlands behind
the dam. Those wetlands are critical to cleaning up water from the
Santa Ana River before it gets to Orange County, thus saving millions
of dollars.</LD>
<LD>   The consultant for the enterprise is a well-connected Republican
who's going to make a lot of money if the project goes through.
That's only the beginning. If the attack on the board is successful,
a proposal by the Wild Lands Conservancy may well fail. In addition,
the water district holds other commercially attractive properties
that may well be the focus of greedy cynics who believe that making a
buck is more important than ensuring Orange County has a reliable
source of clean water from the Santa Ana River.</LD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Re "State, U.S. Feud Over Teachers," Aug. 6:</LD>
<LD>   The state cannot meet federal requirements for "skilled" teachers.
An analogy:</LD>
<LD>   The secretary of defense orders a general to launch 100,000
fighters to support his war strategy. The general says, "We only have
60,000 fighters." But the major says, "Sir, we can send up all 40,000
Cessna planes. That would make 100,000."</LD>
<TE>   The bottom line: If you do not have the resources for a given
strategy, it's time to change the strategy. A solution to the teacher
shortage? Triple the salary of teachers and wait five years for the
pipeline to fill. Or change the curriculum so the currently available
teachers can teach effectively even in the worst schools. Good
curriculum is possible; it is just not in our schools. It is time for
the bureaucracy to stop demanding the impossible and adjust the
methods to reality.</TE>

<LD>Re "Trial Aggravates Parents' Suffering," Aug. 9:</LD>
<LD>   The private lives of Brenda and Damon van Dam were made very
public after the disappearance and murder of their daughter,
Danielle, and unjustly ripped the focus away from the perpetrator
responsible for her death.</LD>
<LD>   Blaming the parents by insinuating they put their daughter in
harm's way is a despicable return to the days when the public, courts
and news media blamed rape victims for the crimes committed against
them. The defense attorney has asserted that Brenda and Damon's
lifestyle was responsible for the murder of their child, and the
media--radio, print and television--has sensationalized the absurdity
of it. The van Dams' daughter was an innocent victim of an appalling
crime, and her parents have been made to suffer more than any family
should ever have to.</LD>

<LD>   Causing suffering to any living creature to satisfy one's ego says
volumes about a person's character--or lack thereof. It is often said
that you can tell a lot about a person by the way he or she treats
animals that they have control over. The way they treat those
creatures is the way they would treat humans if they had the same
level of control. If you happen to live near one of these people,
keep an eye on your children as well as your furry family members.</LD>

<LD>I agreed with most of what Steve Lopez said about the
inappropriateness of the media exploiting the rape angle in the
recent abduction of two teenage girls. However, I don't think it was
appropriate for him to blame the parents for allowing one of the
girls to relate the story of how the girls fought for their freedom.
It became necessary for the girls to defend their honor after that
motor-mouthed policeman decided to give himself some glory by
announcing to the entire nation that the girls had been raped.</LD>
<LD>   I noticed during the interview that the commentator said, with no
sense of irony, "She didn't discuss the rape. She didn't have to."
She sure didn't. Every newspaper and TV station in the country had
done it for you.</LD>

<HD>Cyber Cafe Rules Are Ill-Conceived, Illogical</HD>

<LD>Re "Judge Delays Restrictions on Cyber Cafes," Aug. 9:</LD>
<LD>   The Garden Grove City Council will continue wasting taxpayer money
to defend its ill-conceived cyber cafe regulations even though the
city's proposed ordinance was suspended last week by a judge on
constitutional grounds. Council members had unanimously passed the
ordinance, not caring that it had no rational connection to the
crimes they wanted to regulate. Worse, the council did not care that
the law would affect the rights of law-abiding small-business owners.</LD>
<LD>   Garden Grove took two unfortunate incidents of juvenile crime and
exploited the situation for political advancement. Cyber cafe owners
met Mayor Bruce Broadwater to discuss the ordinance, but the city
insisted that the ordinance was necessary and proper. The cyber cafe
owners then had no choice but to go to court.</LD>
<TE>   Garden Grove's theory was that if crimes occurred outside two
cyber cafes, all cyber cafes must be causing crime; and if cyber
cafes are regulated out of business, then the crimes will go away.
But the city makes no rational connection between the businesses they
are trying to punish and the crimes they hope to prevent. Using the
city's "logic:" if someone were robbed coming home from the grocery,
closing all groceries at 10 p.m. would prevent future robberies.</TE>
<TE>   The council ineptly felt that "something must be done" but was
incapable of doing something reasonable, effective and
constitutionally proper. Garden Grove forced cyber cafe operators to
shorten their business hours, hire security guards and enforce curfew
restrictions. Owners were directed to maintain customer registration
logs with names and IDs for the police. Video surveillance and
recording systems had to be installed at owner expense. Owners were
required to post notices and enforce a ban on any boisterous
language.</TE>
<TE>   The council touted the regulation as the toughest in the county.
The justification for the regulation? Primarily two unrelated events:
The homicide of a young man that led to the arrest of a 21-year-old
gang member and eight teenagers, and the shooting, not gang-related,
that occurred about 1 1/2 miles from a cyber cafe.</TE>
<TE>   As one cyber cafe owner stated, "We don't want gangs any more than
anyone else." Certainly no family-owned business operator, or any
family member, wants gangs moving into their neighborhood. But now,
Garden Grove's family-owned businesses have to be more worried about
mindless legislation that can use the force of law to put them out on
the streets.</TE>

<LD>I wonder if the Republican Party realizes the mistake they are making
by not backing candidate Bill Simon for governor. If Gray Davis wins
reelection he will surely be on the ticket as Hillary Clinton's vice
president. Then the Democrats will have all the electoral votes of
the two largest states. One wonders why the Republicans don't pull
their head out of the sand.</LD>

<TE>   California voters are faced with the sad November choice between
Very Gray Davis and Simple Simon for our next governor. The incumbent
proves to be an expert at raising funds from corporate supporters of
energy and other budget-busting companies, while Simon remains a
questionable fund manager. However, I see a welcome alternative
choice. We can write in our choice on the ballot. Richard Riordan,
former mayor of California's largest city, did run for governor as a
Republican, but was denied the candidacy by that party's
ultraconservatives. Riordan was a great mayor. He represented all the
people--moderates, liberals and independents. He was respected
throughout the state. He would be a better governor than either major
party candidate.</TE>

<HD>Transportation Fix That Isn't</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JACK MALLINCKRODT</AU>
<BD>Jack Mallinckrodt is an engineer who lives in North
Tustin</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Orange County Transportation Authority recently received the
results of a Cal State Fullerton study on the economic benefits of
the proposed CenterLine light rail project. Using established
economic multiplier factors, the study's authors determined that the
$2.1-billion construction and initial operation expenditure would
pump $3.2 billion into the county's economy. OCTA Chairman Todd
Spitzer was quoted as saying that CenterLine is "not just a
transportation project. It is an economic engine."</LD>
<LD>   But before we get carried away by the prospects of this money
machine, it would be good to understand what the study really did and
did not say. The study specifically reported only the impact of
purchasing and employment for the construction and operation. It did
not study the impact of transportation benefits, direct or indirect.</LD>
<LD>   The multipliers that were used are common to any large
project--say, spending $2.1 billion to dig and fill a hole in the
ground. Such a "Hole" project would be expected to provide about the
same multiplier and return to the county.</LD>
<TE>   Ironically, if transportation impacts had been taken into account,
the Hole would have a more beneficial impact than CenterLine. How is
this possible? Therein lies a significant story, the dirty little
secret of CenterLine.</TE>
<TE>   CenterLine wold take most of its required right-of-way from some
of the busiest streets in Orange County. Even the elevated version
would take at least one lane of street capacity for its footings. As
it turns out, the street capacity lost to that one lane of
right-of-way is more than the effective capacity afforded by the new
rail ridership. The result is a net loss of regional capacity and,
inevitably, increased overall congestion, emissions and energy
consumption.</TE>
<TE>   This is independently confirmed in the environmental impact
analysis. The objective quantitative results show that street
congestion, intersection congestion, air quality and travel time all
literally would be worse with the CenterLine alternative than doing
nothing at all. While the energy analysis found a small annual
operating energy reduction, only a tiny fraction of the much larger
up-front construction energy would be recovered over the lifetime of
the project. These adverse OCTA findings are all fully referenced and
explained in detail on my Web site, www.urbantransport.org/ten.pdf.</TE>
<TE>   OCTA's environmental analysis provides this astonishing summary:</TE>
<TE>   "Compared to the No Build Alternative, all build alternatives
would have more adverse impacts on the environment (without
mitigation) for traffic circulation, displacements, public services,
visual quality, cultural resources, noise/vibration, hazardous
materials, water resources, natural resources, parks/trails, and
environmental justice. Mitigation measures are proposed to reduce
these impacts."</TE>
<TE>   The "without mitigation" term here needs some explanation. At the
time of the latest environmental assessment, measures to reduce or
eliminate CenterLine's adverse traffic impacts had been proposed but
the costs were not estimated. Thus the impacts analysis was done
without such mitigation measures and reflects the full, adverse
impacts of Centerline itself.</TE>
<TE>   Ironically, the only way these adverse impacts could possibly be
mitigated would be to acquire new right-of-way and build new road
capacity to replace that lost to CenterLine. If this were feasible,
it surely would demand the question: Wouldn't we be better off to
build only the mitigating road capacity and skip CenterLine and its
net adverse impacts?</TE>
<TE>   Full mitigation will not occur because it would require, among
other things, acquiring some 16 miles of street-front right-of-way
along busy arterial streets. The cost of that, including legal
defense fees, which OCTA assumes would be borne by the cities, is
perhaps incalculable, but would probably be more than CenterLine
itself. So we are going to be stuck with those adverse impacts.</TE>
<TE>   The final irony is that the $2.1 billion to be spent on the
proposed light-rail project, when added to a plan already top-heavy
with transit allocations, would consume 84% of available
transportation funding for the next 20 years, according to OCTA's
long-range financial plan. That would leave only 16% for our already
under-capacity highway system, which is not enough to keep up with
the projected 43% growth in demand.</TE>
<TE>   CenterLine is a multibillion-dollar waste that will make Orange
County traffic and travel times worse. The unprecedented congestion
that we otherwise could have largely alleviated by using those
billions of dollars to improve our highway system will be the true,
lasting legacy of CenterLine.</TE>

<AU>JOHN J. PITNEY JR.</AU>
<BD>John J. Pitney Jr. is professor of government at
Claremont McKenna College and author of "The Art of Political
Warfare."</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Since coming to California in 1986, I've spent equal time in Orange
and Los Angeles counties. After all these years, I've concluded
Orange County is better.</LD>
<LD>   Any discussion of California living standards has to start with
roads. Granted, things are far from perfect in Orange County. If the
afterlife has Purgatory, this county has the Riverside Freeway. On a
quiet night in Anaheim Hills, you can hear the wails of motorists who
started their trips during the governorship of Jerry Brown.</LD>
<LD>   Still, road life is worse in the big bad county to the north.
Consider the I-5. The Los Angeles portion usually glows an angry red
on the Internet traffic maps, indicating gridlock and suggesting that
the "I" in I-5 stands for "Inferno." As you inch along the pitted
pavement, billboards torment you by touting the TV shows you are
about to miss because you will get home late. At one point, you pass
"the Citadel." They say it's an outlet mall, but it looks like a
military prison. Maybe that's where they put complainers like me.</LD>
<TE>   In the unlikely event that you can cross several lanes and reach
your exit, you then must fight the surface streets. In the 1991 movie
"Grand Canyon," Kevin Kline put it well: "Making a left turn in L.A.
is one of the harder things you'll learn in life." In Los Angeles
County, a left-turn pocket is rarer than a Gray Davis smile. Usually,
you have to wait at the light as oncoming traffic speeds through and
the cars behind you honk. If you're lucky, you can get away with
careening around the corner just after the light turns red.</TE>
<TE>   If you're not lucky, you have to deal with police officers from
Los Angeles or Inglewood. (Be prepared. Wear a helmet.)</TE>
<TE>   Then there's parking. Yes, Orange County has its parking problems.
Rumor has it that Irvine Spectrum's lot stretches across the Arizona
state line. But parking is generally more reasonable than in parts
north, particularly downtown L.A. Instead of meters, parking spaces
there come with assumable mortgages.</TE>
<TE>   And mortgages bring us to the issue of housing. Orange County real
estate can be rather pricey compared with most of the country. But
it's a bargain compared with Los Angeles County, where they ran out
of land during the Jurassic era. What Jed Clampett paid for his
Beverly Hills mansion in 1962 would now buy a timeshare in a Glendale
doghouse.</TE>
<TE>   Defenders of Los Angeles County might reply that it has a big
advantage in glamour. Yes, it's true that bus tours of celebrity
homes do not make stops in Fullerton. And it's also true that Us
magazine has no plans to profile the Orange County Board of
Supervisors. To see a film legend, you have to visit the John Wayne
statue at the airport.</TE>
<TE>   But so what if Los Angeles is home to all the stars who still have
a pulse? They spend their free time in celebrity haunts, so unless
you get a ticket to a Jay Leno taping, you'll never see them anyway.
In real life, the only "industry" types you'll meet are the fringe
folks that Nathanael West wrote about in "The Day of the Locust."</TE>
<TE>   At a reception a few months ago, I sat next to a fellow who
described himself as a "manager" for a celebrity couple. A few
minutes of conversation made clear that "manager" meant "gofer."</TE>
<TE>   Orange County holds its own in entertainment choices. Besides its
world-class theme parks, it has the Performing Arts Center. Los
Angeles County does have the Hollywood Bowl, but that's a net minus
in my book. With its ghastly system of stacked parking, the wait to
leave can take longer than the performance. And the place attracts
annoying people the way spilled soda attracts ants. Many patrons
bring picnic dinners, and their meal of choice seems to be smelly
fish. A distressingly large portion of the audience is under the
impression that every show is a sing-along.</TE>
<TE>   Quite often, the best show in Southern California is Orange County
politics. The motto of local politicians comes from Strother Martin's
classic line in "Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid": "I'm not crazy.
I'm just colorful." The county's central congressional district has
provided the most colorful figures: Bob "Clinton has KGB ties" Dornan
and Loretta "Celebrate family values at the Playboy Mansion" Sanchez.
In the 1990s, county officials added to the fun by turning government
finance into the fiscal equivalent of the Indiana Jones thrill ride.</TE>
<TE>   L.A. County can't compete. Its residents have to settle for
listening to Mayor Hahn on their car radios while waiting to make a
left-hand turn.</TE>

<HD>Arrests of 2 Murder Suspects Shatter Hopes in Case of
Missing British Girls</HD>

<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL>SOHAM, England</DL>
<LD>A drama that has gripped Britain took a chilling turn Saturday as
police arrested two people, reportedly school employees, on suspicion
of murdering a pair of 10-year-old girls who vanished from this rural
village two weeks ago.</LD>
<LD>   Detectives had said only the night before that they remained
optimistic that Holly Wells and Jessica Chapman were alive. But their
use of the word "murder" in announcing the arrests shattered the
hopes of residents of Soham, near Cambridge, and the rest of the
nation.</LD>
<LD>   Police later said two bodies had been found 20 miles away in a
wooded area called Thetford Forest Park, near the U.S. air base of
Lakenheath, but said it would take time to identify them.</LD>
<TE>   A spokesman said the bodies were discovered by a man walking in
the woods at about 1 p.m. He said the forensic examination of the
area would be a "long process."</TE>
<TE>   News reports identified the suspects as Ian Huntley, a caretaker
at the local secondary school, and his partner, Maxine Carr, a former
teaching assistant who worked with Holly and Jessica's primary school
class until July.</TE>
<TE>   Cambridgeshire police did not release names of those arrested,
saying only that they had apprehended a 28-year-old man on suspicion
of murder and abduction and a 25-year-old woman on suspicion of
murder. The ages matched those of two people questioned by police
Friday and identified by news organizations as Huntley and Carr.</TE>
<TE>   Det. Chief Inspector Andy Hebb, announcing the arrests at a news
conference, said officers had discovered "items of major interest to
our inquiry" at the school.</TE>
<TE>   Holly and Jessica vanished Aug. 4 wearing identical Manchester
United soccer shirts. A security camera recorded them as they walked
through Soham together shortly after leaving a family barbecue that
Sunday afternoon.</TE>
<TE>   The search for the girls has received round-the-clock media
coverage. More than 400 police took part in the investigation, making
it one of the biggest manhunts in British history.</TE>
<TE>   Candlelight vigils were held in Soham, and detectives received
about 14,000 tips from the public. Soccer star David Beckham, whose
No. 7 shirt the girls were wearing, made a personal plea for their
safe return.</TE>
<TE>   Police had said as late as Friday night that they still held out
hope the girls were alive, and their parents pleaded at a news
conference for the abductor to return them.</TE>
<TE>   After the arrests were announced Saturday, the streets of Soham
were nearly deserted despite sunny weather that would normally bring
families out. A few people huddled in groups discussing the case,
while parents kept an anxious watch on their children.</TE>
<TE>   Posters plastered all over the village appealed for information on
the girls.</TE>
<TE>   "There's a deep sense of foreboding. It's a very strange and tense
atmosphere," said the Rev. Tim Elbourne, diocesan director of
education at the local St. Andrew's Church.</TE>
<TE>   "There's been a constant flow of people during the day coming to
church, being quiet and expressing their feelings."</TE>

<LD>A swollen river burst its banks and swamped dozens of villages in
Bangladesh on Saturday, while in eastern India officials said seven
people drowned when a boat capsized in swirling flood waters.</LD>
<LD>   Forecasters warned of more rain in a monsoon season that has
caused 911 deaths since June in Nepal, India and Bangladesh. An
additional 25 million people have been displaced or stranded.</LD>
<LD>   In China, the death toll from landslides caused by torrential
rains in the southern province of Yunnan has risen to 52, official

Altogether, more than 900 people have died in China this year because
of seasonal storms.</LD>
<TE>   Floods have killed 330 people in India, the latest when a boat
sank Friday in a rising river in Bihar state. The accident happened
in 90 miles northwest of Patna, the state capital, said Ram Vichar
Rai, Bihar's relief and rehabilitation minister.</TE>
<TE>   The state's water department said that intermittent rains Friday
and Saturday had kept most rivers dangerously high and that more rain
was expected.</TE>
<TE>   As most of India struggles with the worst drought in years, heavy
rains and flooding have destroyed about 2.5 million acres of crops
and disrupted the lives of more than 15 million people in Bihar,
which is along the eastern Himalayan foothills. At least 276 people
have died in the state.</TE>
<TE>   In northern Bangladesh, the Jamuna River overflowed and spilled
into dozens of villages Saturday, relief officials said. At least
2,000 people had to flee or were stranded by high water, in an area
about 65 miles northwest of the capital, Dhaka. Thousands of people
in the area already were homeless because of floods.</TE>

injuring 13 people, police said.</LD>
<LD>   The grenade exploded on a soccer field about an hour before a

serious. The crowd fled but eventually returned to the field. As many

the Dalai Lama to visit in September because it would offend
long-standing ally China.</LD>
<LD>   About 30 people gathered at the ministry, holding pictures of the
Dalai Lama and signs saying: "Give the Dalai Lama a visa" and "Let
our teacher come to Russia." Police said the protest was

<LD>Thousands of right-wing extremists marked the 15th anniversary of the
death of Adolf Hitler's deputy Rudolf Hess by marching through the
southern German town of Wunsiedel, where he is buried.</LD>
<LD>   Several hundred police officers flanked 3,000 neo-Nazis, many of
whom carried pictures of Hess and waved banners.</LD>
<LD>   Hess was sentenced to life in prison at the Nuremberg war crimes
trials. He hanged himself in Berlin's Spandau prison on Aug. 17,
1987. Police said they had sealed off the cemetery where Hess is
buried and made 34 arrests, mostly for possession of Nazi symbols and
weapons.</LD>

party officials said.</LD>
<LD>   Police were investigating Friday's killing of Ahman Ahmed Pategi,
chairman of the People's Democratic Party in west-central Kwara
state, to determine if it was a political assassination. A wave of
political violence has gripped Nigeria in the run-up to elections
next year, the first since the end of military rule in 1999.</LD>

<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL>VLADIKAVKAZ, Russia</DL>
<LD>Battles between Russian troops and separatist rebels continued in the
southern republic of Chechnya on Saturday as officials reported 14
soldiers, five civilians and as many as 32 guerrillas dead in the
latest violence.</LD>
<LD>   Fighting in the Urus-Martan district broke out Thursday night,
officials said, when rebels ambushed Russian checkpoints, attacked
the local police and military commandant's headquarters and raided
the houses of local pro-Moscow officials.</LD>
<LD>   During the clashes, five civilians were killed by Russian
artillery fire in the nearby village of Gekhi-Chu, an official in the
Moscow-backed Chechen administration said Saturday on condition of
anonymity. Russian media reported that a 5-year-old girl was among
the dead. The fighting in Gekhi-Chu continued Saturday, the official
said.</LD>
<TE>   At least nine Russian servicemen were killed and 10 wounded Friday
in other nearby towns, the official said.</TE>
<TE>   Ilya Shabalkin, a spokesman for the Russian military in Chechnya,
said in televised remarks Saturday that 32 rebels were found dead
after the clashes. The Chechen official did not confirm that
information, and a rebels' Web site said the separatists had suffered
no losses.</TE>
<TE>   Deaths in the conflict, now in its third year, are almost
impossible to verify independently. Both sides routinely exaggerate
enemy casualties and play down their own.</TE>
<TE>   Elsewhere in Chechnya, rebels attacked Russian positions 16 times
within the last 24 hours, killing three servicemen, the Chechen
official said. Two more soldiers were killed when rebels attacked a
military convoy near the village of Dyshny-Vedeno, the official said.</TE>
<TE>   Russia, which withdrew from Chechnya after a 1994-96 war, returned
in 1999 after rebel incursions into a neighboring region and after
apartment bombings blamed on separatists killed more than 300 people
in Russian cities. Russia says it now controls the republic, but its
troops still die almost daily in rebel attacks.</TE>

<DL>PRAGUE, Czech Republic</DL>
<LD>Zookeepers in the Czech capital lured a hippopotamus out of its
hiding place in the elephants' pavilion Saturday, thrilled to find
the animal had survived last week's devastating floods.</LD>
<LD>   The 18-year-old hippo, named Slavek, was spotted only Friday, days
after the animal disappeared in the chaos of raging waters at the
Zoological Garden.</LD>
<LD>   "For us, it was a great surprise to find him," said zoo director
Petr Fejk. "He was very angry." But he did not stop eating, Fejk
said.</LD>
<TE>   Slavek was one of two hippos missing and feared dead in the
flooding, which killed scores of animals, including 80 birds, an
elephant, a gorilla, a lion and a bear.</TE>
<TE>   On Saturday, the zoo was covered in mud, some of it ankle-deep,
where the flood waters had receded.</TE>
<TE>   "What's ahead of us is cleanup, disinfection and cleanup again,"
Fejk said.</TE>

<HD>Iraqi Opposition Faces a Test of Unity</HD>
<DH>Mideast: U.S. urges disparate groups, with diverse visions
of a post-Hussein era, to widen their base to better represent
society.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBIN WRIGHT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>From his suite at the Ritz-Carlton overlooking Georgetown, Sharif Ali
bin Hussein spoke passionately last week about bringing the royal
family back to Iraq--and putting himself on the throne.</LD>
<LD>   "Our belief after 40 years of failed republics is that the people
want a return of the monarchy. This is what we're being told by
Iraqis themselves," said the dapper chief of Iraq's Constitutional
Monarchy Movement, who fled Baghdad at age 2 after his cousin King
Faisal II was assassinated in 1958.</LD>
<LD>   Across town, in the Ritz-Carlton at Pentagon City, legendary Iraqi
Kurdish leader Jalal Talabani relighted a half-smoked cigar after a
working breakfast and opined about a new Iraq that is democratic and
parliamentary--and provides "more than autonomy" for the beleaguered
Kurds.</LD>
<TE>   As the United States begins plotting Iraq's future after the
anticipated fall of President Saddam Hussein, the biggest challenge
may be designing and sustaining a new government that embraces the
spectrum of Iraqi society.</TE>
<TE>   Such a government has never existed in modern Iraq, a nation with
artificial borders delineated by colonial masters. And, despite the
new show of unity during talks with the Bush administration last
week, Iraq's widely diverse opposition still has widely diverse
visions of the future.</TE>
<TE>   "A military operation in Iraq will be comparatively easy. The hard
part will be constructing a truly representative system afterward. It
will take long-term U.S. hand-holding to keep Iraqis focused on the
prize," said Henri J. Barkey, a former Iraq expert in the State
Department who is chairman of Lehigh University's international
relations department.</TE>
<TE>   "This is not your dad's Germany or Japan," he said. "It'll be much
harder to politically rebuild Iraq."</TE>
<TE>   Yet the Bush administration now holds out hope that the opposition
can be crafted into a viable force--and a potential weapon against
Hussein. U.S. officials, including some who once criticized the
opposition for its squabbling, pettiness and questionable accounting,
were almost giddy with enthusiasm last week after a session with
Iraqi opposition leaders.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a turning point, absolutely," said a senior administration
official who requested anonymity. "Certainly those of us sitting in
the room were all impressed with the dynamic of coordination and
consultation among the six groups."</TE>
<TE>   Even the failure of Massoud Barzani, leader of the Democratic
Party of Kurdistan, to attend the Washington talks did not discourage
either the Americans or the opposition. Barzani stayed away, citing
logistical reasons, despite an offer of a U.S. aircraft, according to
the White House.</TE>
<TE>   Iraqi sources said he was also concerned about backlash from
Hussein against his region, in the north of Iraq, for participation
in the talks. Instead, he sent a representative.</TE>
<TE>   Otherwise, the Iraqis surprised even themselves in their new
ability to cooperate. "We are in a new era," Talabani said.</TE>
<TE>   Over the next two months, the six leading opposition groups face a
series of tests to prove their recent words--and their future worth,
according to U.S. officials.</TE>
<TE>   First, the opposition must expand its reach. The administration
met with six groups: two Kurdish movements, a Shiite Muslim religious
party, the monarchists, an umbrella group led by a U.S.-educated
Shiite businessman and a smaller coalition led by a Sunni Muslim.</TE>
<TE>   The administration wants the six to embrace dozens more elements
from Iraqi society, including military defectors, professionals who
could help rebuild Iraq, various tribes, and other ethnic groups,
such as the Turkmens and Assyrians.</TE>
<TE>   Widening the opposition base will be a key goal of an
international conference tentatively scheduled for September
somewhere in Europe. The U.S. also is calling on the opposition to
take the lead in persuading the world to support an American-led
effort to oust Hussein.</TE>
<TE>   "We told them to get out and make the case for regime change,
especially in the Arab world," the administration official said.
"We'd like to see a joint delegation moving around the region. It's
important to get Iraqis out there so it's seen as their mission, not
just ours."</TE>
<TE>   It's a role that the opposition claims it is ready to assume. "We
know we need to explain our cause--and in one voice. It will make a
big difference in what others think and do," said Talabani, the
Kurdish leader.</TE>
<TE>   After the conference, a joint delegation will fan out to persuade
skeptical governments, he added.</TE>
<TE>   Further, the opposition must set out the framework for a new Iraq.
With U.S. guidance, a number of working groups are forming specifics
of a new constitution.</TE>
<TE>   Secretary of State Colin L. Powell last week called on the
opposition to "help the Iraqi people come up with a representative
form of government that will reflect the best values of the 21st
century world and not the criminal values represented by Saddam
Hussein."</TE>
<TE>   Most important, the disparate groups have to hold together.</TE>
<TE>   "We have to convince the world that we are a viable organization
that will prevent the breakup of Iraq and not slaughter each other at
the first opportunity and that we aren't going to disintegrate into a
civil war after Saddam is gone," acknowledged Hussein of the
monarchist movement, who hopes to restore the Hashemite kingdom to
Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   Specifically, the diverse opposition groups must stop sabotaging
efforts by individuals or smaller groups to outline the specifics of
transferring power, said Judith Yaphe, a former intelligence analyst
now at National Defense University in Washington.</TE>
<TE>   Iraqis counter that divisions within the opposition were in part a
product of divisions in Washington. Now that the U.S. government has
come together around a common objective, reflected in the array of
once-squabbling U.S. officials at the first round of talks Aug. 9,
"unity of purpose" also will prevail among the opposition, said
Barham Salih, prime minister of the Kurdistan Regional Government.
How long the unity will last is open to question. Ties remain
tenuous.</TE>
<TE>   The only thing that has changed during the last few divisive years
is a serious prospect of ousting the Iraqi president. "So it's still
a marriage of convenience," Barkey said. And a post-Hussein period
also could lend itself to a new round of squabbling for spoils.</TE>
<TE>   But in some ways, the immediate goal of unity contradicts the
long-term U.S. objective.</TE>
<TE>   "It's nice to have them working together, but you can't expect
total uniformity now if you don't expect it later--and the goal is to
open up Iraq to all its diversity," Yaphe said. "You want to have
them feel they can transfer their diversity to a free Iraq."</TE>

<HD>Israeli Soldiers Crack Down on Palestinians Breaking Curfew</HD>
<DH>Mideast: More than 150 are held in Hebron. Stun grenades
injure several civilians in a market.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL>HEBRON, West Bank</DL>
<LD>Israeli soldiers combed the streets of this city Saturday, rounding
up more than 150 Palestinians and throwing stun grenades into a
crowded market to enforce a curfew, Palestinian witnesses said.</LD>
<LD>   Doctors at Hebron's Al Ahli hospital said at least five
Palestinians were treated for shrapnel injuries and burns caused by
the grenades in the open-air market.</LD>
<LD>   Witnesses said Israeli troops rounded up dozens of Palestinians as
shopkeepers and vegetable vendors remained open and people refused to
return to their homes.</LD>
<TE>   The army reoccupied Hebron and six other major cities in the West
Bank in June after a spate of suicide attacks in Israel.</TE>
<TE>   Israeli forces often lift curfews during daytime, but Hebron
residents said restrictions were tightened Saturday. Israel has said
it imposes and relaxes curfews based on security considerations.</TE>
<TE>   In the West Bank city of Nablus, Israeli forces seized an activist
of the militant Islamic organization Hamas at his grocery store as
his wife and children watched, Palestinian security officials said.</TE>
<TE>   They identified him as Baha Yaish and said he had spent time in
Israeli and Palestinian Authority prisons for his activity in Hamas,
which has carried out a spate of suicide bombings in Israel.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, in the Gaza Strip, about 600 Palestinians marched
through the Bureij refugee camp carrying the bodies of Ashraf Awada,
30, and Alla abu Said, 27, militants from the Al Aqsa Martyrs
Brigade.</TE>
<TE>   Palestinians say the two men were working when they were shot by
the Israeli army Thursday. The army said they had been trying to
infiltrate Israel.</TE>
<TE>   "Death to Israel!" and "When will there be revenge for the Al Aqsa
martyrs?" shouted the crowd as about 20 gunmen fired assault rifles
into the air.</TE>
<TE>   As the curfews, arrests and funerals continued, Palestinian
officials were angered Saturday by an overnight Israeli Channel Two
TV report that the army had a contingency plan to expel Palestinian
Authority President Yasser Arafat by force. Arafat would be sent to
an unnamed Arab country having no diplomatic relations with Israel
and no close ties with the U.S., Israel's premier ally, the report
said.</TE>
<TE>   The report, which did not cite any sources, said the plan was
approved in principle by Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon and
would entail a raid on Arafat's compound in Ramallah by special
forces, who would ensure that Arafat was not harmed.</TE>
<TE>   The report said the contingency plan was not likely to be
implemented soon. The army and the prime minister's office would not
comment.</TE>
<TE>   "We denounce the mere thinking of such despicable ideas,"
Palestinian Cabinet member Saeb Erekat said from Cairo. "At a time
when we are trying to revive the peace process, the Israeli
government is thinking such ideas."</TE>
<TE>   Israeli TV said more Israeli- Palestinian security talks were
planned for today. Negotiations have stalled over an Israeli proposal
called "Gaza First."</TE>
<TE>   Under the plan, Israel would pull its forces back from the
outskirts of Palestinian population centers in Gaza and turn security
over to Palestinian forces as a test case. If successful, Israel
would implement the same procedure in the West Bank.</TE>
<TE>   Palestinians rejected the plan, insisting that a withdrawal from
Gaza be accompanied by the removal of troops from at least one West
Bank town.</TE>

<HD>Paramilitary Rule Pleases the Locals</HD>
<DH>Latin America: Troops' presence has helped transform a
Colombian town for the better.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>T. CHRISTIAN MILLER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SAN BLAS, Colombia</DL>
<LD>The first clue that you've entered an outlaw paradise comes soon
after the army checkpoint.</LD>
<LD>   A cheery blue-and-white sign announces, "Here, we are all
paramilitaries!"</LD>
<LD>   Then come the men in camouflage, carrying huge machine guns. And
the stolen gas tankers parked by the side of the road. And the
clean-cut locals.</LD>
<TE>   This is the capital of the "self-defense forces" of the Sur de
Bolivar region, one of the most feared units of Colombia's
paramilitary army.</TE>
<TE>   The right-wing paramilitary groups are listed by the U.S. State
Department as terrorists. They are accused of committing massacres,
selective killings and torture. The Colombian government has pledged
to create a special unit to hunt them down.</TE>
<TE>   And yet, finding them is as easy as taking a taxi.</TE>
<TE>   "Here, everybody supports us," Pedro, a local paramilitary
organizer, says as he sits in his home in a nearby town, a
9-millimeter pistol tucked casually in his belt.</TE>
<TE>   For decades, this small chunk of rolling hills and river valley in
central Colombia was the territory of the National Liberation Army,
or ELN, the nation's second-largest leftist guerrilla army.</TE>
<TE>   The rebels blackmailed local businesses, blockaded roads,
kidnapped businesspeople and generally made life miserable.</TE>
<TE>   Then, two years ago, the Colombian government offered to pull
troops out of the area and turn it into a demilitarized zone for
peace talks.</TE>
<TE>   The locals had had enough. Some engaged in civil disobedience.
Others joined the paramilitary groups, whose ranks had swelled
dramatically since their formation in the mid-1990s.</TE>
<TE>   After a dirty war in which hundreds of people disappeared or were
killed, the paramilitary groups emerged victorious. The ELN all but
vanished, confined only to the high reaches of a nearby mountain
range.</TE>
<TE>   Human rights groups have long accused the Colombian army of
collaborating with the paramilitary forces. After all, both groups
have a common enemy--the guerrillas.</TE>
<TE>   Local Colombian military commanders deny that, and say they have
engaged in dozens of battles with the illegal right-wing fighters.
They say they simply don't know who the paramilitary soldiers are,
nor where they are.</TE>
<TE>   They apparently aren't looking too hard. There's a Colombian army
checkpoint only five miles from San Blas, where the results of the
paramilitary conquest are only too obvious.</TE>
<TE>   Approaching the town, the paramilitary forces have posted signs
warning of $250 fines for those who pollute local streams. There are
also large billboards proclaiming this the territory of the
paramilitary groups' Central Bolivar Bloc, which controls Sur de
Bolivar and surrounding regions.</TE>
<TE>   In town, paramilitary troops wander openly, automatic rifles in
hand. They lounge at local restaurants and practice maneuvers on
nearby hills.</TE>
<TE>   The paramilitary headquarters is in a home on a hill overlooking
the village. Camouflaged soldiers spill out in every direction,
lounging on the porch, talking with neighbors.</TE>
<TE>   One paramilitary soldier wears a shirt that reads: "The real
counter-guerrilla squad"--a reference to the often-ineffectual
Colombian army units that label themselves the same way.</TE>
<TE>   Inside, computer wizards have set up an Internet connection via a
cellular phone, a satellite dish and some cable wiring. "Purely
homemade," a technician says with a laugh.</TE>
<TE>   Comandante Gustavo, the local commander, exercises his authority
from a light and airy study reached by a concrete flight of stairs at
the back of the home.</TE>
<TE>   Gustavo is surrounded by fellow commanders. A telephone rings
incessantly, bringing news from a nearby battle that has been raging
for eight days between his forces and the FARC, the country's largest
leftist guerrilla group, which has recently begun moving fighters
into the area.</TE>
<TE>   Gustavo acknowledges that the battle is "fierce." But he says his
fighters will triumph because they enjoy the support of the people.</TE>
<TE>   "We work very closely with the local population," he says.</TE>
<TE>   Gustavo is young, perhaps 30, and educated. He sounds as committed
as any U.S. aid worker when he talks about his desire to rid the
surrounding region of coca by encouraging the substitution of legal
crops for illegal ones.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, aid workers aren't usually surrounded by armed
followers who will enforce their hopes and dreams.</TE>
<TE>   The paramilitary presence has helped transform the town.
Children's playgrounds have been installed, with brightly colored
red, blue and yellow plastic swing sets that would fit into any
Orange County suburb.</TE>
<TE>   There are signs asking locals to pick up trash. The streets are
clean. Crime is nonexistent.</TE>
<TE>   And many locals are grateful.</TE>
<TE>   "Things have been much better since the paramilitaries came. It's
much more calm, much more tranquil," says Marco Antonio Parro, a
local community leader.</TE>
<TE>   The reaction underscores a key difference between the paramilitary
groups and the FARC, or Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia.</TE>
<TE>   The paramilitary forces appear to make a concerted effort to win
the support of the local populace in areas they dominate. The rebels
seem largely indifferent to the fate of the poor for whom they are
supposed to be fighting.</TE>
<TE>   For instance, the difference is striking between San Blas and San
Vicente del Caguan, the center of a demilitarized zone that served as
headquarters for government peace talks with the FARC.</TE>
<TE>   There, after nearly three years of rebel control, locals' lives
had worsened. Streets were dirty and crowded. Prostitution
flourished. Drug crops sprouted. Roads remained unpaved.</TE>
<TE>   Francisco de Roux, a Franciscan priest who runs a nonprofit
alternative development program, says the paramilitary groups have
been welcomed by much of the populace because they seem so much more
capable than the guerrillas of improving the quality of life.</TE>
<TE>   He says the paramilitary groups' efforts at winning popular
support and doing away with coca were political strategies designed
to remove themselves from the State Department's terrorist list and
improve their international image.</TE>
<TE>   "The self-defense forces are trying to position themselves as a
political group with political concerns," De Roux says. "They are
trying to make themselves freedom fighters."</TE>
<TE>   But Gustavo, relaxing in his studio, says good PR has nothing to
do with the paramilitary fighters' actions. Instead, he says, the
main concern is improving locals' lives.</TE>
<TE>   "This," he says, "is a laboratory of peace."</TE>

<HD>John Paul Relives Memories as He Visits Old Haunts in
Poland</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID HOLLEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>KRAKOW, Poland</DL>
<LD>Spending a day steeped in nostalgia, Pope John Paul II visited one of
the homes of his youth Saturday, stopped at his old university and
consecrated a new basilica at a religious sanctuary where he sought
comfort during World War II.</LD>
<LD>   "Many of my personal memories are connected with this place," the
Polish John Paul, 82, said at the end of a three-hour Mass he
celebrated in the new basilica at the Sanctuary of Divine Mercy.</LD>
<LD>   "I used to come here, especially during the Nazi occupation, when
I worked in the nearby Solvay" chemical plant and quarry, the pontiff
recalled. "Every day I walked this road, coming to work ... in wooden
shoes that one used to wear in those days. How could one imagine that
this man in wooden shoes would one day be consecrating the Basilica
of Divine Mercy?"</LD>
<TE>   In his ninth visit to his homeland since he became pope, John Paul
is receiving a rapturous welcome from ordinary Poles and the nation's
top leadership. Former President Lech Walesa, a onetime shipyard
worker who together with John Paul played a key role in undermining
communism in Poland, said in an interview after the Mass that John
Paul is "the only authority, the only real unquestionable leader" of
this country.</TE>
<TE>   That image was reinforced when President Aleksander Kwasniewski
and Prime Minister Leszek Miller met separately with John Paul on
Saturday evening. Both said afterward that they had discussed a wide
range of Poland's problems, including unemployment, faltering
economic growth and the country's bid to join the European Union.</TE>
<TE>   "He's in good shape, intellectually perfect," Kwasniewski said
after the talks. John Paul suffers from Parkinson's disease, and his
grueling schedule Saturday left him looking more tired than he had
upon his arrival Friday evening, when he seemed invigorated to be
home. The pontiff will celebrate an open-air Mass today and return to
Rome on Monday.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm absolutely certain that this is not the last pilgrimage [to
Poland], as some people think," Miller said. "From the side of Polish
authorities, there's absolute readiness to have John Paul here as a
guest whenever he wants to come. I gave the pope such a declaration,
and he smiled and said, 'Well, if God allows.' "</TE>
<TE>   Officials at Jagiellonian University in Krakow, where John Paul
studied more than half a century ago, presented the pontiff with an
enrollment certificate for "student number one" that specified he is
"not obliged to attend every class or pass each exam."</TE>
<TE>   "This card allows the Holy Father to take up studies in all of our
11 departments, in a symbolic return to the university after many
decades," Rector Franciszek Ziejka said.</TE>
<TE>   The university, initially known as the Krakow Academy, was founded
in 1364 by King Casimir the Great. It established a faculty of
theology in 1397.</TE>
<TE>   Riding in his bulletproof popemobile, John Paul also stopped in
front of a gray two-story house where he lived in ground-floor rooms
with his father after they moved from the future pope's birthplace,
Wadowice, in 1938, so that the young Karol Wojtyla could attend
university. His mother had already died, and his father died in 1941,
but he lived in the house until 1944.</TE>
<TE>   John Paul remained in his vehicle outside, but Grzegorz
Bielatowicz, 7, who now lives in the house with his siblings and
mother, brought him an oversize bunch of flowers. The boy's teenage
sisters share the room where the future pontiff once slept, their
teddy bears occupying the space where he kept his kneeling pad for
prayers.</TE>
<TE>   John Paul called Grzegorz into the popemobile, blessed him and
gave him rosaries for his family.</TE>
<TE>   "It's an incredible feeling," said Dorota Bielatowicz, patting her
son fondly. "The pope didn't enter the house, but we could give him
flowers. That's the most important."</TE>
<TE>   In his homily at the morning Mass, John Paul declared that "where
hatred and the thirst for revenge dominate, where war brings
suffering and death to the innocent, there the grace of mercy is
needed to settle human minds and hearts and to bring about peace."</TE>
<TE>   "Wherever respect for life and human dignity are lacking, there is
need for God's merciful love, in whose light we see the inexpressible
value of every human being," he continued. "May this message radiate
from this place to our beloved homeland and throughout the world."</TE>
<TE>   On Saturday evening, keeping up a long tradition, John Paul
appeared at the window of the Krakow archbishop's residence, where he
lived for 14 years until his election as pope in 1978. Some of the
main rooms he used back then have been left largely untouched, with
the same furniture and paintings on the walls, and Polish church
officials said that on this pilgrimage, he is sleeping in the same
bed he used as archbishop.</TE>
<TE>   After people in the street below greeted the pontiff with chants
of "Welcome home," he began to banter with the mostly youthful crowd,
recalling his initial visit as pope in 1979.</TE>
<TE>   "Since our first meeting here at this window, 23 years have
passed, and I'm older by 23 years," he declared. The crowd laughed,
applauded and chanted, "You are young!"</TE>
<TE>   "Those who were here 23 years ago ... are also older by 23 years,"
the pope continued.</TE>
<TE>   The crowd responded: "They're also young!"</TE>
<TE>   "Well, there's nothing we can do then," John Paul said as the
crowd laughed and applauded. "If they're young, then they're young.
There's nothing we can do about it."</TE>
<TE>   The crowd then burst into a song often used at birthdays, "One

<HD>Flood Crisis Buoys Image of Schroeder</HD>
<DH>Europe: The German leader has reassured his nation and
quickly secured financial aid, reviving his flagging reelection
campaign.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CAROL J. WILLIAMS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>BERLIN</DL>
<LD>Among the most dramatic rescues during the past week of catastrophic
flooding in Central Europe might turn out to be that of German
Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder.</LD>
<LD>   Much as the Sept. 11 attacks in the United States thrust President
Bush into a leadership spotlight that earned him unprecedented
approval ratings, Schroeder's handling of the natural disaster that
has inflicted double-digit billions of dollars in damage is being
viewed by the German media and commentators as both competent and
comforting.</LD>
<LD>   The Social Democratic leader, who was trailing badly in his
campaign for reelection before disaster struck, has emerged in rubber
boots and rain gear on the ravaged shores of the Elbe and Mulde
rivers to reassure Germans that they will get the help they need to
rebound.</LD>
<TE>   He has swiftly secured financial aid, vowed a fresh rebuilding of
the ex-Communist east and emotionally appealed to all Germans to pull
together in this time of national disaster.</TE>
<TE>   Continuing his dynamic engagement in the massive crisis-management
effort, Schroeder will be the host here today of an emergency "flood
summit" to coordinate relief work with the leaders of other inundated
countries--Austria, the Czech Republic and Slovakia.</TE>
<TE>   In the campaign for Sept. 22 federal elections, Schroeder's Social
Democrats and their environmentalist Greens partners have been dogged
by opposition charges that they've done too little to relieve chronic
unemployment and have saddled citizens with a steep "eco-tax" on
gasoline to discourage driving.</TE>
<TE>   But the floods, blamed by many scientists on global warming from
excessive fossil-fuel emissions, have helped legitimize the
incumbents' ecological priorities among many voters now coping with
the wrath of Mother Nature.</TE>
<TE>   And with the destructive swells that have forced hundreds of
thousands from their homes still making their way north toward other
German cities such as Dessau, Magdeburg and Hamburg, reflection on
man's culpability in the worst such flood on record is expected to
rise apace with the Elbe's waters.</TE>
<TE>   The governors of most German states hit by the flooding are
members of the opposition Christian Democratic Union and have shown
themselves to be as responsive as Schroeder in tackling the
devastation. But in a disaster that transcends national as well as
state boundaries, German victims have looked for leadership on the
international stage and found their chancellor at the center.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, in seeming confirmation of the electoral uplift
Schroeder's government is getting, conservative challenger Edmund
Stoiber, the Bavarian governor, broke off a North Sea island vacation
Friday to don his own anorak and waders to visit the crisis regions.</TE>
<TE>   Some media have charged both candidates with cynical self-interest
in using the national tragedy as a campaign theme.</TE>
<TE>   "A Flood for the Chancellor," the weekly Der Spiegel, due out
Monday, contends in a headline, while casting Schroeder as a steady
hand in the crisis. In contrast, Stoiber's failure to include any
environmental expert in his so-called Competence Team will be viewed
as a serious miscalculation, the influential magazine predicts.</TE>
<TE>   "Climate Change for the Chancellor?" the conservative daily Die
Welt wondered, noting that the Christian Democrats allied with
Stoiber are now on the defensive and the Greens "are hoping for a
Renaissance for their key themes."</TE>
<TE>   Previously at risk of failing to draw even enough votes to be
represented in the next Parliament, the Greens have suddenly become
the trusted experts on ecological workings. Foreign Minister Joschka
Fischer, their most popular figure, has been appealing to fellow
Germans to take a lesson from the disaster. Environment Minister
Juergen Trittin and the Green in charge of agriculture and consumer
protection, Renate Kuenast, have emerged as voices of conscience that
Germans have long failed to heed.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile Saturday, the deluge rolled on.</TE>
<TE>   Fears of an ecological catastrophe at the chemical industrial
complex in Bitterfeld intensified after thousands of soldiers and
civilian volunteers gave up efforts to steer the surging waters away
from the city. The Mulde River, which feeds into the Elbe a few miles
farther north, broke through a levee, spilling the muddy,
debris-laden deluge across the evacuated city.</TE>
<TE>   Helicopters joined in piling sandbags around the ChemiePark, which
sits about 7 feet higher than the city center and may escape serious
harm now that the water has worked its way to other low ground.</TE>
<TE>   Elsewhere, all 5,000 residents of Muehlberg, in Brandenburg state,
evacuated before a dam burst. In Riesa, just to the south in Saxony
state, flood waters washed out a railroad bridge, severing train
traffic from Berlin to Dresden and Leipzig.</TE>
<TE>   Farther downriver in the city of Torgau--where U.S. and Soviet
soldiers met after defeating the Nazis--15,000 people were evacuated
ahead of the next expected inundation. In Magdeburg, the capital of
Saxony-Anhalt state, thousands fled their homes to escape the mass of
water expected to hit Monday.</TE>
<TE>   In Dresden, where cultural jewels such as the Zwinger Palace and
Semper Opera have been deluged, the flood waters finally began
receding after reaching 31 feet Friday, five times the river's normal
level. Still, Saxony Interior Minister Horst Rasch warned that "the
catastrophe is not over, even if the high point has passed." And Gov.
Georg Milbradt estimated that damage to Dresden alone will cost as
much as $5 billion to repair.</TE>
<TE>   European Commission President Romano Prodi will take part in
today's emergency summit and was reported to be preparing promises of
at least $1 billion in aid. French President Jacques Chirac has also
come to Schroeder's side in the tragedy to "reiterate my country's
readiness to do all it can to help save lives and come to the rescue
of local populations."</TE>
<TE>   President Bush made a similar promise to Czech President Vaclav
Havel to assist that nation in repairing billions in damage.</TE>
<TE>   Bush's failure to offer solidarity with Schroeder may reflect
White House pique over the chancellor's recent warnings against U.S.
military "adventures" against Iraq. But Germans share Schroeder's
view that an attack on Saddam Hussein without U.N. support should be
avoided, but that diplomatic oversight is unlikely to hurt the
political fortunes of the incumbent.</TE>

<HD>Russia, Iraq Near Economic Accord</HD>

<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>MOSCOW</DL>
<LD>Iraq and Russia are close to signing a five-year, $40-billion
economic cooperation plan, an Iraqi official said Saturday,
reinforcing Moscow's close ties to Baghdad even as the United States
weighs a military attack to drive Saddam Hussein from power.</LD>
<LD>   Iraq's ambassador to Moscow, Abbas Khalaf, said the agreement
envisions new cooperation in the fields of oil, irrigation,
agriculture, transportation, railroads and electrical energy and will
probably be signed in Baghdad in September. Soviet or Russian
specialists built much of Iraq's infrastructure, so Baghdad wants
Russian expertise to help repair or upgrade it.</LD>
<LD>   Despite Russia's support for U.S. anti-terrorism efforts in the
wake of the Sept. 11 attacks, Moscow has been maintaining or
improving ties with Iraq as well as Iran and North Korea--countries
that President Bush has labeled an "axis of evil."</LD>
<TE>   Washington is trying to rally support for a possible invasion of
Iraq. The U.S. accuses Iraq of supporting terrorism and rebuilding
its banned weapons of mass destruction program.</TE>
<TE>   Sanctions imposed by the United Nations Security Council after
Hussein's forces invaded Kuwait in 1990 cannot be lifted until U.N.
inspectors certify that Iraq's biological, chemical and nuclear
weapons have been destroyed.</TE>
<TE>   Khalaf emphasized that the new cooperation deal would not violate
the sanctions. The Russian Foreign Ministry said Saturday that it had
no comment on reports of the deal.</TE>
<TE>   President Vladimir V. Putin has sought to create a network of
alliances to counterbalance perceived U.S. domination of global
affairs. Although he has moved Russia closer to the West on many
issues, he has also pursued ties with countries that are anathema to
the U.S.</TE>
<TE>   Last month, Russia announced a 10-year plan for nuclear
cooperation with Iran, which Washington fears could help Tehran build
nuclear weapons. And last week, the Kremlin said North Korean leader
Kim Jong Il will visit Russia this month for the second summer in a
row.</TE>

<HD>Singapore Reclaims Water, and Its Self-Sufficiency</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD C. PADDOCK</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SINGAPORE</DL>
<LD>In this prosperous island city-state, the latest way to promote the
nation's independence might seem a bit revolting: drinking water
recycled from residents' sewage.</LD>
<LD>   But brushing aside coarse jokes from citizens and snide remarks
from neighboring Malaysia, Singapore's earnest officials have
launched a campaign to make the country more self-sufficient by the
use of treated waste water called "NEWater."</LD>
<LD>   "We now have our own water," Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong declared
recently as he drank a small promotional bottle of NEWater after a
tennis match.</LD>
<TE>   Ultimately, the government plans to introduce the reclaimed water
into the city's water system and deliver it as tap water.</TE>
<TE>   Tropical Singapore, half the size of the city of Los Angeles,
relies heavily on water from Malaysia that is piped across the
mile-wide Johore Strait separating the two countries.</TE>
<TE>   With a major contract for cheap Malaysian water set to expire in
2011, Singapore hopes to sell its 4.3 million people on NEWater as an
alternative source.</TE>
<TE>   Officials say that with the latest purification technology, the
recycled waste water is perfectly safe to drink. The idea is much the
same, they say, as the process that keeps astronauts supplied with
water in space.</TE>
<TE>   Many Singaporeans who have sampled the reclaimed water say it is
nearly tasteless. Some prefer it to the city's chlorinated tap water.
Others say they can't tell them apart.</TE>
<TE>   "There's no difference," office worker Yee Lai Han said after
trying NEWater for the first time. "The most important thing is to
have water to drink."</TE>
<TE>   Water districts in some parts of the United States, including
Orange County, have been mixing reclaimed waste water with ground
water or other sources of drinking water since the late 1970s,
Singaporean officials note.</TE>
<TE>   "There is a water shortage worldwide because of population growth
and urbanization," Trade and Industry Minister George Yeo Yong Boon
told reporters last week. "And this technology will not be used only
in Singapore and a few other places, but in many places."</TE>
<TE>   In a country where political dissent is effectively muzzled, the
NEWater campaign has given humorists a welcome opportunity to poke
fun at the government.</TE>
<TE>   "It's totally natural, like Evian, except that it doesn't come
down from snowy alpine rivers but from your very own kidneys,"
quipped the satirical Singaporean Web site talkingcock.com, which
features a picture of a rooster, in one recent posting.</TE>
<TE>   Referring to a recent economic downturn in Singapore, the Web site
said that 2002 "will be looked on as a superb harvest year for
NEWater. In that year, Singaporeans were asked to swallow a lot of
things, from unemployment to fare hikes. These have enriched the
taste of NEWater considerably."</TE>
<TE>   Just across the border in Malaysia's southernmost state of Johor,
Chief Minister Abdul Ghani Othman warned residents to watch out for
Singapore's water when they travel to the island.</TE>
<TE>   "We from Malaysia should know that when we go to Singapore one day
and drink coffee, the water comes from behind their kitchens or
washrooms," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Relations between the former British colonies have often been
strained since Singapore broke off from Malaysia to form its own
country 37 years ago. Periodically, Malaysian officials threaten to
turn off Singapore's tap.</TE>
<TE>   In a speech this year, Goh cited a November 2000 article by a
Malaysian colonel that discussed the possibility of putting chemical
or biological poisons into Singapore's water supply.</TE>
<TE>   "Without water, Singapore may not survive," Lt. Col. Azmy Yahya
wrote in the Malaysian Armed Forces Defense College journal,
Strategi. "Malaysia should take full advantage of water as a
strategic weapon to counter Singapore's military advantage over
Malaysia."</TE>
<TE>   Singapore is one of the few major cities in Southeast Asia with
potable tap water.</TE>
<TE>   The country has been operating its water purification system and
producing NEWater for two years, mainly for industrial use.</TE>
<TE>   It also operates a desalination plant, but reclaiming waste water
is less costly than removing the salt from seawater.</TE>
<TE>   Before officials add NEWater to the drinking water supply and mix
it in the city's reservoirs, the government is carrying out an
education campaign to alleviate the public's fears. On Aug.
9--Singapore's independence day--the government introduced NEWater by
giving away 60,000 promotional bottles.</TE>
<TE>   "Over the National Day period, we've all got drunk on NEWater,"
said Yeo, the trade and industry minister. "I think the response has
been wonderful. There's a sense that this technological breakthrough
enables us to be self-sufficient if we have to be."</TE>
<TE>   Then, on Monday, Singapore began giving away bottles of the water
at the offices of the Public Utilities Board. A steady stream of
people came in to pick up the maximum six bottles for personal use.
Officials estimated that they were handing out 1,000 bottles an hour.
But they have no plans to sell NEWater by the bottle. The giveaway is
scheduled to last a month.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it's fabulous," said Ngiam Shing Kok, an office worker
who stopped by to pick up half a dozen bottles. "It makes us
self-sufficient. It's always better if a person or country can rely
on himself."</TE>

<HD>80 White Farmers Held in Zimbabwe</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>HARARE, Zimbabwe</DL>
<LD>Police have arrested more than 80 white farmers in the last week and
charged some in court for defying government orders to vacate land
targeted for redistribution to landless blacks, a farm group said
Saturday.</LD>
<LD>   It also said police and war veterans had assaulted a white farmer
during his arrest Saturday, a month after he left his farm in
compliance with a government eviction notice.</LD>
<LD>   "Tony Smith, who left his farm a month ago, was severely beaten up
early this morning allegedly by police and war veterans at his
Chisipite home in Harare," Justice for Agriculture spokeswoman Jenni
Williams said in a statement.</LD>
<TE>   She said the group was trying to get Smith released from custody
so that he could be treated for a suspected broken leg and head
injuries.</TE>
<TE>   It was unclear why he was arrested, and police were not
immediately available for comment.</TE>
<TE>   The government of President Robert Mugabe has ordered 2,900 of
Zimbabwe's remaining 4,500 white commercial farmers to give up their
land without compensation, but nearly two-thirds are refusing to go
after ignoring an Aug. 8 deadline.</TE>
<TE>   Mugabe, who has been in power since the country gained
independence from Britain in 1980, says his land drive is aimed at
correcting colonial injustice that left 70% of the best farmland in
the hands of a few thousand white farmers.</TE>
<TE>   Zimbabwe has been in crisis since pro-government militants led by
veterans of the 1970s liberation war began invading white-owned farms
in early 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Nearly half the population is short of food because of disruption
on the farms and a drought affecting much of southern Africa.</TE>
<TE>   On Saturday, the 11 Pacific members of the Commonwealth called for
stronger action against Zimbabwe but stopped short of threatening to
expel the country.</TE>

<HD>Unfettered by History, Pa. Town Creates a Battle
Re-Creation</HD>

<DL>DOWNINGTOWN, Pa.</DL>
<LD>To mark the anniversary of the Revolutionary War, one Pennsylvania
town decided to celebrate its heritage with a reenactment of its
hard-fought skirmish against the invading British.</LD>
<LD>   Trouble is, it didn't happen.</LD>
<LD>   Nor was there any record of a British loyalist being captured,
tried or sentenced to die. But that, too, is to be shown for the
celebration, dubbed "Milltown--Washington's First Line of Defense."</LD>
<TE>   Roger Grigson, president of the Downingtown Area Historical
Society, has searched for any record of military activity in
Downingtown, formerly Milltown, during the climactic Revolutionary
War years of 1777 and 1778. Grigson's conclusion: "There wasn't."</TE>
<TE>   Other communities in the area are busily observing key
Revolutionary War events from the fall of 1777 that left Gen. George
Washington and the Continental Army struggling to survive the winter
at Valley Forge.</TE>
<TE>   "We have all these other anniversary celebrations going on around
here," Grigson said. "The Battle of Brandywine was Sept. 11. They are
having a very, very large reenactment. The Paoli Massacre was Sept.
21. They are having a big reenactment."</TE>
<TE>   But little went on that autumn in Milltown, where a heavily Quaker
community, numbering around 100, operated mills, limekilns and inns
for stagecoaches traveling between Philadelphia and Lancaster. Among
them was Thomas Downing, the man Downingtown was named after.</TE>
<TE>   The only military presence was a unit of Continental soldiers who
passed through the area after the Paoli Massacre and a surgeon who
operated on some of the wounded, Grigson said.</TE>
<TE>   But Jane Davidson, historic preservation officer for Chester
County and author of a history of Downingtown, said the town did have
a supply depot for the war effort, where locals stored 900 barrels of
flour, 26 hogsheads of liquor, and supplies of pork, bass, soap and
candles.</TE>
<TE>   They also disagree about whether Washington, fearing a British
attack from the west, ordered the militia to the town Aug. 23.
Grigson said the British never arrived. Davidson said they did.</TE>
<TE>   Either way, "Milltown--Washington's First Line of Defense" is
being billed as a living history of the Revolutionary War era, rather
than of any particular event.</TE>
<TE>   The event will include demonstrations of traditional day-to-day
activities such as wool spinning, paper making and gunsmithing, as
well as portrayals of Colonial tavern life. Then there is the mock
skirmish, capture and trial, and another event, "Gen. George
Washington to address the troops," that Grigson said is also
fictitious, as Washington was not in Downingtown at the time.</TE>
<TE>   Washington did not visit until years later as president, he said.</TE>
<TE>   No inaccuracy is intended, Davidson said. "It's an observation of
18th century Colonial living, because Downingtown--Milltown--was a
village halfway between Philadelphia and Lancaster."</TE>
<TE>   Grigson refused to take part in preparations for the reenactment
after he saw how things were shaping up at the first planning
meeting. But he said the historical society will have a booth and
will sell calendars at the event to help raise $2 million to restore
the Ashbridge House, built by Thomas Downing before 1709 as a wedding
present to his daughter.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm certainly not a perfectionist," Grigson said. "I don't really
need half the town mad at me."</TE>

<LD>Cincinnati police used tear gas to break up a crowd of more than
2,000 youths who ran "wilding" through a black family festival.</LD>
<LD>   Groups of 10 to 150 youths, mostly 16-to 18-year-olds, moved
through a downtown park and into the city's center, starting fights
and overturning tables, police spokesman Lt. Kurt Byrd said.</LD>
<LD>   At least eight people were arrested. There were reports of
gunshots, and several people were taken to the hospital with
injuries.</LD>
<TE>   The three-day festival, which continues today, is designed to
focus positive attention on black families. Cincinnati had three days
of rioting in April 2001 after a white police officer shot a black
man who was fleeing police.</TE>

<LD>A mockingbird gobbled hundreds of rare butterflies in an Indianapolis
zoo exhibit over two weeks while evading attempts to catch it.</LD>
<LD>   The bird apparently entered the zoo's conservatory through a vent
or window. The exhibit had about 1,500 butterflies. The lost
butterflies were worth about $1,000. Brilliant neon butterflies
called blue morphos were especially hard hit.</LD>
<LD>   "You can't blame the bird. He was doing what came naturally," zoo
gardener Susan Micks said.</LD>

<LD>Raising red, black and green flags and clenched fists, thousands of
African American activists descended on the National Mall, demanding
reparations from the U.S. government for centuries of slavery and
racism against blacks.</LD>
<LD>   The assembly for Millions for Reparations was modest by Washington
standards, as the rally filled a small swath of the grassy expanse
near the Capitol.</LD>
<LD>   But organizers called it an important event for the grass-roots
movement, which has gained momentum over the last several years, with
prominent lawyers and professors now calling for compensation to the
descendants of slaves for free labor and decades of Jim Crow laws
they say are responsible for the economic and social ills in the
black community.</LD>

<HD>Bush Is Set to Embark on a Whirlwind Schedule</HD>
<DH>Politics: The president goes on the road for his agenda and
for GOP candidates, with plans to travel more than four days some
weeks.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAMES GERSTENZANG</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>CRAWFORD, Texas</DL>
<LD>President Bush is planning to play an aggressive role in the autumn
congressional campaigns, seeking to retain a Republican majority in
the House and restore Republican leadership of the Senate.</LD>
<LD>   Of the 230 days so far this year, Bush has been out of Washington
all or part of 119, slightly more than one trip every other day, and
not including his weekend visits to Camp David. He is likely to speed
up even that torrid pace in the next two months.</LD>
<LD>   White House officials have said that during some weeks, Bush may
be on the road four or five days.</LD>
<TE>   Not all of his political work, however, will be visible.</TE>
<TE>   On Friday, for instance, in what politicians consider a crucial
part of their job, he spent roughly two hours performing what is
known as "donor maintenance."</TE>
<TE>   In black-and-white checkered shirt, black denim pants, black boots
and a Western-style belt bearing four Texas Lone Stars, he schmoozed
with some of the most generous contributors to his 2000 presidential
campaign, those who gave $100,000 each or were responsible for
rounding up that sum from others.</TE>
<TE>   They were invited from around the country to a barbecue at the
Broken Spoke Ranch, owned by Bush neighbors Stan and Kathy Hickey;
the Hickeys had hosted a similar luncheon in April. The guests
clattered over the cattle guard in luxury coaches, passing beneath a
metal sign featuring depictions of a military helicopter, two
cactuses and three wagon wheels.</TE>
<TE>   An informal survey--reporters were barred from the
event--suggested a smaller turnout than four months ago. In April,
private jets bringing the guests to central Texas caused
near-gridlock on the tarmac of the small airport in Waco, the nearest
landing strip that could accommodate them.</TE>
<TE>   But Rebecca Fleming, of Texas Aero, which services private
aircraft, said only about 20 had landed for the Friday party, down
from about 75 in April.</TE>
<TE>   To these supporters, some of whom were not regular political
contributors in the past--at least not at such a high level--the
underlying message was this: Don't forget the congressional
candidates this year.</TE>
<TE>   Bush hopes to protect, if not expand, the Republicans' 12-vote
lead in the House. In the Senate, Democrats hold a one-vote margin.</TE>
<TE>   The immediate need for money is not readily apparent. Under
tighter circumstances, the party would cut off funding for campaigns
that appear to be going down the tubes, spending it instead on close
races where it might make a difference.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Still Supporting Simon</TE>
<TE>   In California, Bill Simon Jr.'s struggling gubernatorial race
might be a candidate for such economies, with the national party
deciding to cut its losses. But the party has decided it is flush
enough to continue supporting Simon's effort.</TE>
<TE>   One Republican lobbyist in Washington said the reports he is
getting from Republican National Committee officials suggest "they're
getting money hand over fist, and they're setting all kinds of
records in the money they're getting."</TE>
<TE>   Party officials would not disclose how much money they have
received in recent weeks. Official reports are not due for several
weeks.</TE>
<TE>   During his 19 months in office, Bush has spoken at nearly 50
fund-raising breakfasts, lunches, dinners and receptions that have
brought in at least $100 million to Republican candidates and the
party itself, running well ahead of the former records set by
President Clinton.</TE>
<TE>   The political activity will make for a crowded fall calendar.</TE>
<TE>   Bush is pressing Congress to complete its work on the federal
budget by the end of September while remaining within his spending
guidelines, fighting for his plan to create a Department of Homeland
Security, and wrestling with a struggling economy.</TE>
<TE>   On the diplomatic front, he will be trying to keep the allied
coalition in line in the campaign against terrorism, and presiding
over the debate within his administration, as well as the growing
international debate, over how to respond to what the White House
sees as Saddam Hussein's dangerous program to develop weapons of mass
destruction in Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Mexico Trip Planned</TE>
<TE>   He has at least one foreign trip on his calendar: a visit to
Mexico at the end of October for the annual meeting of the
Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum. He will precede that with a
trip to his ranch with Chinese President Jiang Zemin.</TE>
<TE>   If the past is prelude, Bush will combine many of the items on his
agenda into his travel.</TE>
<TE>   On Wednesday and Thursday, for example, he raised nearly $2
million for Republican gubernatorial candidates in Wisconsin and Iowa
while delivering five speeches. He exercised Clinton-like enthusiasm
for the spoken word, talking more than 2 1/2 hours, as he called on
Congress to support his homeland security plan and sought to calm
jitters over the economy.</TE>
<TE>   It will be more of the same this week. On Thursday, he will leave
his 1,600-acre ranch for a three-day West Coast swing, including
three fund-raising parties in less than 24 hours for Simon in
Stockton, Dana Point and Westwood.</TE>
<TE>   Bush, who is emerging from the isolation of his ranch every few
days to draw attention to specific issues on his agenda, used his
weekly radio speech Saturday to draw a line for Congress over
spending. He suggested that the Senate, in particular, was putting
the nation's economy at risk by not adhering to his budget
restrictions--an argument he is expected to make repeatedly in coming
weeks.</TE>
<TE>   "We must remember the lessons of the past. In the 1960s, increased
spending required by war was not balanced by slower spending in the
rest of the government. As a result, in the 1970s we faced
unemployment and growing deficits and spiraling inflation," Bush
said. "We cannot go down the path of soaring budget deficits."</TE>

<HD>In Georgia, a Race Built on Mideast's Conflict</HD>
<DH>Politics: Incumbent has support of Arab Americans.
Challenger has pro-Israel donors.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NICK ANDERSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The Mideast conflict is reverberating this year in an unlikely
domestic arena: congressional elections in black Democratic
strongholds of the South.</LD>
<LD>   This week, for the second time in the 2002 campaigns, a veteran
House Democrat with significant backing from Arab Americans and
Muslims faces a strong primary challenge from a candidate supported
by Jewish and pro-Israel donors.</LD>
<LD>   Rep. Cynthia A. McKinney, seeking the Democratic nomination
Tuesday in Georgia's 4th Congressional District, hopes to avoid what
befell another five-term House member in an earlier primary. Rep.
Earl F. Hilliard of Alabama was defeated in June by a challenger who
courted pro-Israel constituencies.</LD>
<TE>   The contest in Atlanta between McKinney and Denise Majette, like
the Alabama primary, underscores tensions within the African American
community over relations between Muslims and Jews, and over U.S.
policy in the Middle East.</TE>
<TE>   McKinney, like several members of the Congressional Black Caucus,
has opposed resolutions of solidarity with Israel in its conflict
with the Palestinians. Twice she has drawn controversy in the
aftermath of Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   In one episode, she sought to steer toward black charities a
donation from a Saudi prince who said the United States should
reconsider its pro-Israel policy. In another, she suggested the Bush
administration failed to heed warnings about the terrorist attacks
because the president's allies would profit from the ensuing war.</TE>
<TE>   Majette, a former state judge who like McKinney is 47 years old
and African American, depicts herself as a mainstream Democrat who
would replace an incumbent she calls ineffective.</TE>
<TE>   McKinney has attacked Majette's record on the bench as "out of
control"--likening her in one political advertisement to the
Inglewood police officers recently implicated in the videotaped
beating of a suspect.</TE>
<TE>   During the campaign, McKinney has been unapologetic. "Quite
frankly, my outspokenness is loved by my constituents," she said this
month in a televised debate with Majette. "You will see that on
election day."</TE>
<TE>   The evidence suggests, however, that McKinney is in one of the
toughest fights of her career. Independent polling has shown the race
to be a tossup. Majette in recent financial disclosures has shown
that she has raised more money than the incumbent--$1.1 million,
compared with McKinney's $620,000, as of early August.</TE>
<TE>   Much of the money for both campaigns has come from outside
Georgia. McKinney's donors include the Arab American Leadership
Political Action Committee and many individuals with Muslim or Arab
surnames. Majette lists many donors with Jewish surnames from across
the country.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, McKinney has received donations from black lawmakers
and the endorsement of the Rev. Jesse Jackson. Nation of Islam leader
Louis Farrakhan is scheduled to stump for McKinney before election
day, his organization's Web site said, to counter pro-Israel forces
backing Majette.</TE>
<TE>   Majette has received contributions from Atlanta baseball great
Hank Aaron and Sen. Zell Miller (D-Ga.), and the Atlanta
Journal-Constitution has endorsed her.</TE>
<TE>   Merle Black, a political scientist at Emory University, said the
race is "very close," and he predicted that the outcome would be
decided by how much African American support Majette can muster.
"It's going to be very racially polarized," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Black Democratic voters are the largest electoral bloc in the 4th
District, which includes most of DeKalb and part of Gwinnett counties
in suburban Atlanta. Black said Majette is expected to win support
from most white Democratic voters and most Republicans who choose to
vote in the open primary.</TE>
<TE>   Whoever triumphs Tuesday is all but certain to go on to victory in
November in the heavily Democratic district.</TE>
<TE>   The Democratic candidates were spending the final campaign weekend
touring the district as they attacked each other through television
and radio ads.</TE>
<TE>   While their candidacies have attracted major support from groups
with an interest in the Israeli-Palestinian struggle, the two
candidates so far apparently have not focused on the Mideast in their
campaigns.</TE>
<TE>   Elizabeth Wilson, Majette's press secretary, said the challenger
would focus on McKinney's record. In 10 years in Congress, Majette
charges, McKinney has done little actual legislating and much
grandstanding. Wilson claimed Georgia voters are "embarrassed and
offended" by McKinney's statements. Majette, she said, would seek to
be a "responsive and responsible" lawmaker. In June, Democrat Artur
Davis used much the same formula to unseat Hilliard in Alabama.</TE>
<TE>   Dana Mott, a McKinney spokeswoman, declined to be interviewed. She
referred questions on Saturday to another campaign aide who was
unavailable for comment. But McKinney, in her public statements, has
concentrated her fire on Majette's record. She has sought to tie her
opponent to Republicans and to the insurance industry, claiming that
Majette unfairly ruled against several plaintiffs in civil cases.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts say the contest transcends Georgia's 4th. Chuck Todd,
editor-in-chief of the online political journal the Hotline, called
the McKinney-Majette matchup "totally an Arab-Israel fight." Todd
said McKinney appeared to be waging an all-out fight for survival but
that Majette has "a great chance."</TE>
<TE>   In another closely watched Georgia primary, Republican voters on
Tuesday will unseat one of two House incumbents. Reps. Bob Barr and
John Linder, two GOP veterans, were thrown into the same district in
the northern suburbs of Atlanta through redistricting.</TE>

<HD>Finding No Clues, Officials End Search for Va. Girl</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>BASSETT, Va.</DL>
<LD>Volunteers combing the area's rolling hills for signs of a missing
9-year-old girl whose parents were found shot to death were unable to
discover any evidence and ended their search Saturday, officials
said.</LD>
<LD>   Two days of scouring the rural area near the family's home on
foot, all-terrain vehicles and in cars turned up no trace of Jennifer
Short, said Richard Cox, head of the Old Dominion Search and Rescue
team.</LD>
<LD>   "Frankly, we need to keep looking," a weary Cox said Saturday as
he strained to hold back tears. "But realistically and logically,
putting all the evidence together over the last couple of days, we
don't have a direction to look in."</LD>
<TE>   Police believe Jennifer was abducted early Thursday morning when
her parents, Michael and Mary Short, were each shot once in the head.
Police were notified after a co-worker of Michael Short, 50, found
his body about 9 a.m.</TE>
<TE>   Henry County sheriff's deputies later found the body of Mary
Short, 36. No weapon was found and there was no sign of Jennifer;
authorities quickly ruled out the possibility that the girl shot her
parents and ran away.</TE>
<TE>   At an evening briefing, Henry County Sheriff Frank Cassell said
police believe Jennifer was taken from her bed. He also said new
photos of Jennifer, taken this summer and depicting her with shorter
hair, had been released.</TE>
<TE>   Cassell said police believe the crime was committed "by someone
who knew this family and knew their way around." He gave few details,
saying there are no suspects but that at least one new search warrant
would be requested.</TE>
<TE>   Police initially thought Jennifer hid in the hills behind the home
during the shootings, but when she didn't turn up, authorities issued
an Amber Alert, transmitting information about the missing child to
law enforcement agencies and media across the country.</TE>
<TE>   A team of trained volunteers and about 150 area residents have
searched around the clock since the alert was issued.</TE>
<TE>   State police were continuing their search of a 20-to 50-mile
radius around the Shorts' home Saturday, assisted by sheriff's
deputies from several counties and at least four FBI agents, Cassell
said.</TE>
<TE>   The man who found Michael Short's body, a laborer who had worked
for Short's mobile home moving business and the last to see the
family alive Wednesday night, was questioned and released the day of
the slayings, police said.</TE>
<TE>   Cassell said police have interviewed dozens of people, but it has
been hard finding some of Short's former employees because many were
transient, short-term workers.</TE>
<TE>   The Shorts recently put their home up for sale, and Cassell said
they were checking on people who had been by to look at it.</TE>
<TE>   As the search for her granddaughter went to a third day, Margaret
Hall stayed close to the radio and television at her home in the
hills above Callaway, about 30 miles from where her daughter and
son-in-law lived.</TE>
<TE>   Hall, 71, remembered when she last saw her daughter and
granddaughter at a family cookout two weeks ago.</TE>
<TE>   "She was my baby one. She will always be my baby," Hall said.</TE>
<TE>   Hall's brother, Elmer, said the Shorts had no known enemies, no
major debts and that authorities told him his brother-in-law still
had $60 in his wallet when his body was found.</TE>
<TE>   "It wasn't a robbery," he said.</TE>

<HD>Plans OKd for Federal Worker Evacuations</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>CRAWFORD, Texas</DL>
<LD>The Bush administration has approved plans aimed at speeding the
evacuation of federal workers in the nation's capital in the event of
an attack using weapons of mass destruction, officials said Saturday.</LD>
<LD>   Under the plan, the Office of Personnel Management, the Federal
Emergency Management Agency and the General Services Administration
would have the authority to order an evacuation of up to 350,000
federal workers in the Washington, D.C., area and 1.8 million
nationwide if an attack occurs or if one is deemed imminent.</LD>
<LD>   Operation centers have been set up by the three agencies allowing
around-the-clock communication with federal, state and local law
enforcement. Should an evacuation be ordered, the agencies would
notify federal workers through a system of bulletins in 15 minutes or
less, officials said.</LD>
<TE>   Known as the Federal Emergency Decision and Notification Protocol,
the plan is designed to avoid the confusion that followed the Sept.
11 attacks on New York and Washington. After the attacks, the
administration closed the federal government without notifying
Washington's mayor and other local leaders, who could not be reached.</TE>
<TE>   White House spokeswoman Claire Buchan said the Office of Homeland
Security has been working with state and local governments across the
country to develop comprehensive emergency response plans.</TE>

<HD>Canadian Charged in Missile Inquiry</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>ROSWELL, N.M.</DL>
<LD>The president of a counter-terrorism consulting firm has been charged
with possessing 2,352 unregistered small military missiles, according
to court documents.</LD>
<LD>   Investigators also found 4,000 pounds of explosives at High Energy
Access Tools, an anti-terrorism and police training company that was
conducting classes for students from the United Arab Emirates and
Yemen, said Tom Mangan, an agent for the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco
and Firearms.</LD>
<LD>   David Hudak, a Canadian national and president of High Energy
Access Tools, was arrested Thursday and charged with possessing
missiles not registered to him, according to a federal complaint
filed Friday.</LD>
<TE>   The ATF agents were summoned for a search of the company's
facilities in Roswell and Tinnie on Thursday and were there
"basically to handle all the explosives that were taken into
custody," Mangan said Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   He added that the students, who were in the facility at the time,
are cooperating with the investigation.</TE>
<TE>   Mangan declined to elaborate on the investigation Saturday,
referring questions to prosecutors, who didn't return a telephone
call.</TE>
<TE>   Frank Fish, director of security for the company, said after the
arrest that the firm had believed it was licensed to have appropriate
equipment to train U.S. allies and export it to allied nations, but
found out the permit was not filed. He did not specifically mention
the missiles.</TE>
<TE>   Fish also said the company invited agencies to inspect its sites
because the firm wanted to be sure it was compliant.</TE>
<TE>   The complaint, obtained by the Albuquerque Tribune for a story in
its Saturday editions, referred to the missiles' official designation
as the M141 Bunker Defeat Munition.</TE>

<HD>Groups Airing 'Utah's Dirty Little Secret'</HD>
<DH>Polygamy: As activists gather, they say state's inaction on
the issue allows sexual assaults, child abuse, welfare fraud to go
unchecked.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JULIE CART</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>ZION NATIONAL PARK, Utah</DL>
<LD>It's been two years since Utah's Legislature appointed a full-time
investigator to root out crimes associated with polygamy. But, aside
from last year's high-profile prosecution and imprisonment of
polygamist Tom Green, no other cases have been brought to court.</LD>
<LD>   Anti-polygamy activists, who gathered here Saturday for an
unprecedented meeting, charge that the state has not done enough to
stamp out "Utah's dirty little secret." They say the inaction is
allowing child abuse, welfare fraud and sexual assault to continue
unchecked in polygamous communities.</LD>
<LD>   Groups from Utah, Arizona and Canada met for the first time to
gather material for a report they intend to forward to the United
Nations Commission on Human Rights. They also have recruited former
"sister wives" to help build a massive class-action suit to be filed
against a polygamous religious group that arranges marriages of girls
as young as 13.</LD>
<TE>   Activists called polygamous leaders "the American Taliban," saying
women are subjugated by the practice of plural marriage.</TE>
<TE>   And over and over again, they said Utah's polygamy investigator
has merely provided political cover for the state, which has little
interest in delving into a highly sensitive issue.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it's a good show, but it's all a political game," said
Flora Jessop, who fled her polygamous family in Colorado City, Ariz.,
when she was 16.</TE>
<TE>   Colorado City and Hildale, Utah, are polygamous communities that
straddle the states' borders about 40 miles southwest of here. There
are an estimated 40,000 polygamists living in western areas of the
U.S. and Canada, where some splinter groups have fled after internal
fractions.</TE>
<TE>   "Polygamy is an ugly word, no matter how you look at it," Jessop
said. "But child abuse is ugly too. What do people think is going on
in these towns? There are still children being abused and still girls
trying to run away. So as long as that's [still the case], no, I
can't say there's been any progress in two years."</TE>
<TE>   Officials say that investigating closed societies is difficult and
that women and girls seldom come forward to report abuse. In some
rural areas, the sheriff and county prosecutor are reluctant to get
involved in what they view as a matter of religious choice or
lifestyle, state officials say.</TE>
<TE>   Anti-polygamy activists say that's no excuse for not going after
lawbreakers.</TE>
<TE>   Ron Barton, Utah's polygamy investigator, acknowledges he doesn't
have much to show for two years of work.</TE>
<TE>   "I would have hoped that more would have been done during that
time," he said. "My eyes have been opened to the problems in the
community. The problems are pretty well hidden. There are children
who are victimized, sexually molested by non-family members. Incest.
Underage marriages. Spousal abuse. Welfare fraud. Women and children
are the primary victims."</TE>
<TE>   Barton investigated flamboyant polygamist Green, who was sentenced
last year to five years in prison for bigamy and failing to repay the
state for thousands of dollars in welfare payments his family
improperly received. It was the first conviction of its kind in Utah
in 50 years.</TE>
<TE>   Green, 54, will be sentenced again Aug. 27, this time for child
rape for marrying Linda Kunz Green in 1986 when she was 13. He was
37. She is the only one of his wives that he legally married. The
others were sealed to him in a religious ceremony.</TE>
<TE>   Green's complex family structure, which was dissected during the
trial, gave investigators fits. When they finally constructed a
family tree, Green was charged with rape.</TE>
<TE>   Linda Kunz Green was Green's stepdaughter at the time of their
marriage. Green had been married to Kunz's mother, Beth Cook, whom he
later divorced. Green, who has married two other stepdaughters, has
at least four wives, four ex-wives and 33 children.</TE>
<TE>   Anti-polygamy activists dismiss Green's prosecution as a "show
trial," a charge that riles Utah Atty. Gen. Mark Shurtleff.</TE>
<TE>   "They don't know what they're talking about," he said, adding that
new polygamy cases are being prepared. "I have no respect for people
who just stand there and complain and do nothing to help. This is a
much more wide-ranging problem than we had thought. Other
prosecutions will be forthcoming, but we're making sure to do this
right. We are serious about it."</TE>
<TE>   Aside from appointing a polygamy czar, the Utah state Legislature
has done little to display the political will to deal with the issue.
A draft bill making it easier to prosecute polygamists appears to be
doomed to defeat.</TE>
<TE>   In 2001, legislation was killed that would have punished parents
who allowed unlawful marriages--such as underage or plural unions.</TE>
<TE>   "They've been slow to respond to the issues," said Jay Beswick,
one of the organizers of Saturday's meeting. "I don't think Utah can
really tackle this problem without outside help. They can't do it
themselves because everyone is too connected to polygamy."</TE>
<TE>   Polygamy was a tenet of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day
Saints until 1890, when the practice was outlawed. About 70% of Utah
is Mormon and more than 90% of the state's elected officials are
church members.</TE>
<TE>   In the months before the Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City,
polygamy was a taboo subject for general discussion in Utah. Now,
that informal ban seems to have been lifted.</TE>
<TE>   Even as anti-polygamy activists gain a voice, once publicity-shy
polygamists are speaking out. Signs on Salt Lake City's Main Street
and Interstate 15 advertise a book, "More than One: Plural
Marriage--A Sacred Pioneer Heritage."</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Arizona, which has polygamous communities in Mohave
County on the Utah border, is not talking about it.</TE>
<TE>   State representative Linda Binder attended Saturday's meeting and
said she is dismayed that officials in both states have done so
little about the problems.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't care what consenting adults do," Binder said. "I do have
a problem with sham religious marriages and child abuse. I do have a
problem with that."</TE>
<TE>   Binder said her efforts to pass legislation curbing polygamy have
met resistance. Elected officials can no longer say they are unaware
polygamy exists, she said, or claim ignorance of abuses.</TE>
<TE>   "We have a situation here that is unconscionable," she said. "We
have the Taliban in our backyard. We know about what's happening and
it's time to step up to the plate. I'm a woman. I can't turn my back
on women and children who are in these situations. It's appalling."</TE>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>CHELAN, Wash.</DL>
<LD>Winds calmed Saturday as crews battled wildfires that had burned two
houses and more than 2,000 acres across northern Washington state,
and some evacuees were allowed to return home.</LD>
<LD>   The biggest blaze, three miles northeast of Chelan, had burned
about 1,500 acres and forced the evacuation of about two dozen homes
and cabins in the Cagle Gulch and Naumes areas, said Annie Larsen, a
spokeswoman for Wenatchee National Forest.</LD>
<LD>   However, the evacuation order for Naumes had been lifted, and the
Cagle Gulch area was to be evaluated, she said.</LD>
<TE>   No containment figure was available, Larsen said.</TE>
<TE>   Smaller fires in the region had destroyed two houses, a barn and
other structures, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   Across the nation, 24 large fires active Saturday had burned about
1.1 million acres in 11 states, the National Interagency Fire Center
reported.</TE>
<TE>   Nearly 6,900 firefighters battling the nation's largest active
wildfire hoped to take advantage of higher humidity and lower
temperatures Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   Temperatures as high as 102 earlier in the week had helped a
month-old, lightning-caused fire in southwestern Oregon and northern
California grow to 419,000 acres.</TE>
<TE>   The Biscuit fire was 33% contained Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   A 1,000-acre spot fire ignited overnight on the western edge of
that blaze, and firefighters were concerned that it could spread
toward homes near the coast.</TE>
<TE>   Residents along the upper Chetco and Pistol rivers already had
been warned that they might have to evacuate.</TE>
<TE>   Elsewhere, a 5-week-old wildfire about 125 miles west of Denver
more than doubled in size overnight to 7,000 acres after destroying a
small resort lodge, barn and some outbuildings.</TE>

<HD>Kenya's Big Man Is Being Belittled</HD>
<DH>Africa: President Moi has ruled since 1978. Now a lame
duck, he is being scorned even by allies for trying to pick a
successor 'who can be guided.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVAN MAHARAJ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NAIROBI, Kenya</DL>
<LD>For nearly a quarter of a century, Kenyans have not seen such brazen
displays of insubordination.</LD>
<LD>   Newspaper columnists ridicule the country's maximum leader almost
daily. His fiercest loyalists are openly defying him. And crowds of
ordinary Kenyans--who say he is leaving a legacy of poverty and
corruption--are booing and heckling him as he makes stops across the
country.</LD>
<LD>   Kenyans are stunned that President Daniel Arap Moi, a
power-wielding autocrat who once silenced his critics by jailing
them, is--for the most part--refraining from retaliating.</LD>
<TE>   These days, Moi, one of Africa's last surviving Big Men, doesn't
seem so big after all.</TE>
<TE>   "The myth of Moi is being shattered," said John Githongo, a
political analyst and head of a local anti-corruption group. "Kenyans
probably never thought they'd see this day when it is kosher to
challenge the Big Man.</TE>
<TE>   "Lame-duck politics has arrived in Kenya," he added, explaining
why Kenyans suddenly feel emboldened to take on their president.</TE>
<TE>   For the last several weeks, Kenyans have been debating whether to
grant amnesty to Moi and top government officials after he leaves
office.</TE>
<TE>   The ongoing debate on amnesty for African leaders will be repeated
across the continent over the next decade. In the late 1980s and
'90s, 33 African countries--including Moi's Kenya--adopted
multi-party systems, according to Githongo.</TE>
<TE>   Twenty African leaders won their elections and instituted term
limits. As many of their tenures are coming to an end, the corrupt
past of many African leaders will have to be dealt with by their
successors.</TE>
<TE>   What seems almost certain is that the 77-year-old Moi, who has
ruled this East African nation since 1978 and is barred from running
for reelection, will retire early next year after elections are held.</TE>
<TE>   But analysts say his insistence on handpicking his successor could
rip apart his Kenya African National Union party--which has been in
power since the country's 1963 independence from Britain--and even
trigger ethnic clashes.</TE>
<TE>   Moi has chosen as his heir 41-year-old Uhuru Kenyatta, a
self-described "reluctant politician" and son of Kenya's first
president, Jomo Kenyatta.</TE>
<TE>   The choice of Kenyatta led to an open revolt in Moi's government,
with some of the president's closest ministers accusing him of being
dictatorial.</TE>
<TE>   Environment Minister Joseph J. Kamotho, a Moi loyalist, charged
that the president had a "sinister agenda ... to impose a leader" on
Kenya.</TE>
<TE>   On Monday, Moi fired a warning shot at his critics, sacking
Kamotho and another Cabinet minister who also assailed Kenyatta.</TE>
<TE>   Moi openly acknowledges that he chose Kenyatta because "I have
seen that he is a person who can be guided."</TE>
<TE>   "I will retire after the election, but don't think I will go
home," he told party supporters recently. "I will play other roles."</TE>
<TE>   Analysts say Moi's remarks revealed his master plan: to appoint a
puppet so that he can be the power behind the throne.</TE>
<TE>   By selecting a leader beholden to him, Moi--reputed to be one of
the richest men in East Africa--could also protect himself and his
cronies from future prosecution for what many say is a legacy of
high-level corruption and human rights abuses.</TE>
<TE>   The president can trust Kenyatta, analysts say, because Moi helped
protect the vast empire that Jomo Kenyatta amassed during his
presidency. Uhuru Kenyatta, analysts say, would be counted on to
return the favor to Moi's family.</TE>
<TE>   Some analysts say that, in choosing Kenyatta, who belongs to the
large Kikuyu ethnic group, Moi is trying to funnel support from the
opposition, which has been nurtured largely by Kikuyus during Moi's
rule.</TE>
<TE>   Gichira Kibara, executive director of the Center for Governance
and Development, said that if the Kikuyus acquired power through the
opposition, they would certainly retaliate against Moi's party for
instigating ethnic clashes during the 1992 elections in which
hundreds of Kikuyus were killed.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, civic groups here have been debating whether granting
amnesty to Moi and his cronies will ensure a smooth transition of
power.</TE>
<TE>   At one recent conference held by the Kenyan chapter of the
corruption watchdog group Transparency International, the Rev. Mutava
Musyimi, general secretary of the National Council of Churches, said
the nation needs to heal "from grand corruption that has harmed the
economy greatly, to ethnic clashes that have undermined social
cohesion."</TE>
<TE>   During Moi's rule, Kenya--which has a population of 30 million
people and is roughly twice the size of Nevada--has become one of the
most corrupt countries in Africa. The World Bank and other
institutions are withholding hundreds of millions of dollars in loans
until the government tackles high-level corruption.</TE>
<TE>   Kenyans are trapped in a vicious cycle in which the meager wages
of those fortunate to have a job are eaten away by bribes they must
pay for education, health care and basic government services.</TE>
<TE>   But the East African nation has a lot of company.</TE>
<TE>   A recent U.N. report revealed that an estimated $30 billion in aid
for Africa has been plundered, ending up in foreign bank accounts.</TE>
<TE>   Only last month, the Zambian parliament voted to revoke immunity
granted to former President Frederick Chiluba following allegations
that he looted the country's now-bare treasury of hundreds of
millions of dollars. In Ghana, the government is investigating
corruption and human rights abuses of former President Jerry J.
Rawlings, who ruled the West African country for 20 years.</TE>
<TE>   Since Moi ascended to the presidency following the death of Jomo
Kenyatta, he has dominated every aspect of Kenyan politics.</TE>
<TE>   Wags like to say that Louis XIV was also thinking about Moi's rule
when he coined the quote: "L'etat, c'est moi." (I am the state.)</TE>
<TE>   Visitors who drive across Kenya cannot escape evidence of what has
helped make Moi the quintessential African Big Man. Moi Avenue. Moi
International Airport. Moi University. Moi International Sports
Center. Moi Forces Academy. Ubiquitous presidential photographs. A
national holiday to honor himself. Bank notes bearing his image.
Dozens of schools bearing his name.</TE>
<TE>   Critics say Moi can see firsthand the misery in which he is
leaving Kenya: One of his presidential mansions offers a sweeping
vista of the seemingly endless rusty galvanized huts in Kibera,
arguably Africa's largest slum.</TE>
<TE>   Moi, a 6-footer, cherishes dressing in dark suits with a trademark
red rose in the buttonhole. Everywhere he goes, he carries his rungu,
a silver-topped ivory stick that many people say symbolizes his rule
by iron fist. During a visit to Australia, Moi accidentally dropped
and broke his prized rungu. He was so distressed that aides had to
arrange for a replacement to be flown out.</TE>
<TE>   And even though his party led the charge against British rule, Moi
still relishes the trappings of colonialism: "afternoon tea still
served by bow-tied waiters," according to biographer Andrew Morton,
whose book on Moi was widely dismissed as puffery.</TE>
<TE>   Some human rights groups say Moi has tolerated token opposition,
held questionable elections and treated state funds as his own, in
part to perpetuate an entrenched system of patronage.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier this year, there were fears that Moi would try to extend
his rule by changing the constitution. But the United States, Britain
and local civic groups have pressured him to leave gracefully.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts say Kenya is becoming increasingly important to the
United States. If the U.S. decides to attack Iraq, for example,
military agreements with Kenya would allow the U.S. to use the
country's Indian Ocean ports and bases.</TE>
<TE>   Every year, hundreds of thousands of Americans and Europeans flock
to Kenya's game parks to see some of the most abundant wildlife in
the world.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts say Moi is leaving Kenya--once considered one of the most
stable and prosperous countries in Africa--in a destitute condition.</TE>
<TE>   "In the last 15 years, Kenyans have become poorer and poorer,"
said Robert Shaw, an economist in Nairobi, the capital. "People are
getting poorer by the day."</TE>
<TE>   The majority of Kenyans live below the poverty level, earning less
than $1 a day. Under Moi's rule, Kenyans have seen their
infrastructure collapse. Roads remain in disrepair. Telephones work
sporadically. Water and power shortages are commonplace.</TE>
<TE>   Carjackings, robberies and rampant crime have caused many people
to refer to the Kenyan capital as "Nairobbery."</TE>
<TE>   Richard Leakey, the noted paleontologist and wildlife expert who
headed the Kenyan civil service, said the country is facing "probably
the most important election."</TE>
<TE>   "My sense is that it's not so much the replacement of one man,
although that is fundamental to the equation," Leakey said. "It's the
fallout of the change that will see a lot of people brought in, and I
think those new people will make an enormous effort to distance
themselves from the condition they know we [in Kenya] are in at the
moment."</TE>
<TE>   Since naming Kenyatta as his successor last month, Moi has been
playing the role of campaign manager, using the presidential plane,
state helicopters, state media and other government resources to
promote Kenyatta's candidacy.</TE>
<TE>   But many Kenyans are skeptical.</TE>
<TE>   "Go away with Uhuru!" a crowd in western Kenya shouted at Moi when
he sought to introduce Kenyatta to them.</TE>
<TE>   "Goodbye, Moi, we disagree with your views," read placards at
another stop. "Kenyans want to elect their own wise leaders."</TE>
<TE>   Moi's campaign for Kenyatta has drawn fierce opposition from party
stalwarts who have been waiting many years for a chance to succeed
him. Kenyatta's biggest challenge comes from Energy Minister Raila
Odinga, who enjoys the backing of his large Luo ethnic group.</TE>
<TE>   Odinga said he fears that Moi and his cronies will rig the KANU
election when about 4,000 delegates meet in the next several weeks to
choose the party's presidential nominee. The KANU candidate will most
likely be the favorite to win the general election, which is to be
held before Moi's term expires Jan. 3. Kenya's fractured opposition
parties are talking about forming an alliance to field a single
candidate.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts say that because of Moi's backing, Kenyatta is likely to
win but that it's not certain whether the party will survive what
promises to be a bruising internal election.</TE>
<TE>   "The big question is whether the party stays together or not," a
Western diplomat said.</TE>
<TE>   If Kenyatta does win, some Kenyans say, he should be forewarned.
They point to a statement Moi made to another lawmaker a few years
ago.</TE>
<TE>   "You know, a balloon is a small thing. I can pump it up to such an
extent that it will be big and look very important," he said. "All
you need to make it small again is to prick it with a needle."</TE>

<HD>The Dodgers' Team Color Is Now a Deep Shade of Red</HD>
<DH>Baseball: High salaries and fixed costs hurt the bottom
line, but owning team still pays for Fox.</DH>
<SE>Last in a series</SE>
<AU>JAMES BATES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Sandy Koufax gets the strikeout. Steve Garvey digs out a throw at
first base. Slugger Shawn Green clears the bases. Fans head for the
parking lot in the seventh inning to beat the traffic. Broadcaster
Vin Scully's soothing voice resonates through the city on a warm
summer night.</LD>
<LD>   Through much of their 44 years playing baseball in Los Angeles,
the Dodgers have been a model of predictability. For decades, the
club churned out profits with the same ease that it fielded pennant
contenders. As a business, the franchise was golden.</LD>
<LD>   In the flush 1960s, the Dodgers may well have been able to turn a
profit just on parking, sodas, Dodger Dogs, peanuts, pennants and
bobblehead dolls.</LD>
<TE>   "We could have made money letting people in for free based on a
full house," former General Manager Buzzie Bavasi recalls.</TE>
<TE>   Now Dodger Blue gushes red ink. Where financial stability once
reigned in Chavez Ravine, the club's results now bounce around like
beach balls in the bleachers.</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers' $54.5-million deficit last year was baseball's
biggest. The team hasn't turned a profit in nearly a decade. Despite
higher attendance, a lower payroll and an improved on-field
performance, the Dodgers this year expect to lose $41 million. That's
$13 every time a fan walks through a turnstile.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not proud of the fact the Dodgers lost money in 1994, '95,
'96, '97, '98, '99, 2000, 2001 and they'll lose money in 2002," said
Robert Daly, chairman and managing partner. "Nobody with the Dodgers
is proud of that. Nobody in baseball is proud of that."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Payroll Only 1 Problem</TE>
<TE>   How the franchise lost its fastball says a lot about the evolution
of sports economics at the heart of baseball's labor talks, which
took an ominous turn Friday when players set an Aug. 30 strike date.</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers threw millions of dollars at marquee players without
corresponding increases in revenue. In 1985, the Dodger payroll was
$6 million when pitcher Fernando Valenzuela befuddled hitters with
his screwballs. Today, first baseman Eric Karros and outfielder Brian
Jordan, along with pitchers Darren Dreifort and Andy Ashby, make
more. Pitcher Kevin Brown and outfielder Green make more than double
that amount.</TE>
<TE>   Player salaries gobbled up $8 of every $10 in team revenue last
year. The team's $113.7-million payroll was third-highest among
baseball's 30 clubs, behind only the New York Yankees and Boston Red
Sox. It would take the Minnesota Twins two years to generate enough
revenue just to cover what the Dodgers paid players.</TE>
<TE>   But blaming payroll alone masks a series of other problems,
including the upkeep of a beautiful but aging stadium and the nature
of Los Angeles' sports culture.</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers once had the undivided attention of fans here during
the summer. Now the NBA champion Lakers' seasons typically extend
more than 10 weeks into the Dodgers' seasons. The Dodgers also face
the challenge of enticing young fans drawn to such active, edgy
sports as skateboarding and surfing.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   No One Is Panicking</TE>
<TE>   Although the Dodgers last year accumulated more financial losses
than any team, no one is talking about the franchise going under or
being targeted for a buyout by Major League Baseball. The Dodgers are
owned by News Corp., a $15-billion-a-year media company whose
subsidiary, Fox Entertainment, has used the team to build a lucrative
cable television operation in Southern California.</TE>
<TE>   If the $41-million loss the Dodgers expect this year seems
intolerably large, consider that by some analysts' estimates, Fox
lost three times that much on the box-office bomb "Titan AE."</TE>
<TE>   Last week, Rupert Murdoch's News Corp. announced it lost $6.3
billion in its fiscal year stemming from a bad investment in
Gemstar-TV Guide International. It would take the Dodgers 154 years
of losses to equal that number.</TE>
<TE>   Murdoch, News Corp. chairman, acknowledged that he doesn't spend a
lot of time worrying about the Dodgers' financial losses and is glad
that the team is playing better. "I'm thrilled by the improvement in
the team this year," Murdoch said last week, "and by the big increase
in crowd attendance and everything else there."</TE>
<TE>   Sports economists and players are skeptical about baseball loss
figures, including those reported by the Dodgers, citing owner
secrecy. They also contend that much of the value of a franchise
owned by a media company does not show up on the team's balance sheet
but rather enhances the value of the parent company.</TE>
<TE>   Murdoch realized the potential TV value of the Dodgers when he
bought the team in 1998. Before he became the owner, he hadn't set
foot inside Dodger Stadium. On his first opening day, he ate a Dodger
Dog, drank a beer and had some peanuts. More telling, he grilled
executives on player contracts, expressing astonishment at baseball's
rules on guaranteed contracts, which assure that players who can't
perform are still paid.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Tables Have Turned</TE>
<TE>   Players began gaining the upper hand in the mid-1970s when they
won the right to free agency, pitting owners against each other in
signing top players. Before that, owners called the shots, save for a
few occasional player holdouts. In 1966, Dodger pitchers Koufax and
Don Drysdale refused to play until they were promised salaries of
more than $100,000.</TE>
<TE>   Bavasi remembers arguing with two players who demanded single
rooms so they wouldn't have to bunk together on the road. Bavasi
called their bluff, saying he would grant their wishes on one
condition: Their wives had to OK it.</TE>
<TE>   "I never heard from them again about it," Bavasi recalled.</TE>
<TE>   Chasing big-name players not only left the Dodgers writing big
paychecks, it left the club's draft choices depleted through trades
and because of baseball's arcane rule requiring compensation for
teams when others sign their players as free agents.</TE>
<TE>   What top picks remained usually were busts. First-found picks like
Glenn Davis and Ryan Luzinski never made it to the big leagues. Just
one first-round Dodger draft choice in the 1990s, pitcher Darren
Dreifort, is on the team roster. He hasn't pitched in more than a
year because of an injury. Top draft choice Paul Konerko was traded
and emerged as an all-star for the Chicago White Sox. But that paled
in comparison to the 1993 trade of a young pitcher named Pedro
Martinez, who has gone on to win three Cy Young awards.</TE>
<TE>   As a result, the Dodgers are having to spend big money to
resuscitate the team's once-stellar scouting and minor league system,
which had fallen into disarray. The Dodgers see it as their only hope
if they are to emulate clubs such as the Oakland Athletics and
Seattle Mariners that have replaced high-paid superstars with young,
less expensive players. This year, the Dodgers cut player salaries to
$103 million. Daly hopes the strategy will allow him to shrink
payroll to about $80 million.</TE>
<TE>   Bad bets on expensive players cost a bundle.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike most athletes in other professional team sports, baseball
players enjoy guaranteed contracts. That forces a team to continue
paying some players even if they're playing for another team or not
at all.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, the Dodgers paid $10 million to three players who had
moved on, with the bulk going to pitcher Carlos Perez. That money is
enough to cover the salaries this year of catcher Paul Lo Duca,
relief pitcher Eric Gagne, shortstop Cesar Izturis, starting pitcher
Kazuhisa Ishii and center fielder Dave Roberts, while still leaving
$8 million in the bank.</TE>
<TE>   Even as players flexed their newfound muscle at the bargaining
table, it didn't seem to matter to the Dodgers and the team's owners,
the O'Malley family. Walter O'Malley moved the team west in 1958 from
Brooklyn, getting 300 acres in Chavez Ravine and taxpayer-financed
roads in a windfall deal. Using a sponsorship deal from the former
Union Oil Co. as collateral for his loan, O'Malley built a
$17.4-million stadium.</TE>
<TE>   O'Malley and his heirs, son Peter and daughter Terry Seidler, ran
the business paternalistically and profitably. They brought world
championships to Los Angeles in 1959, 1963, 1965, 1981 and 1988. It
was the family's sole business and, for a while, a good one. Stanford
economist Roger Noll in a 1985 study called the Dodgers baseball's
"Denver mint."</TE>
<TE>   But the profits and fun evaporated in the 1990s. Salaries were
"rising by the hour," as Peter O'Malley put it, and there was
lingering animosity between players and owners after the 1994 strike.</TE>
<TE>   It didn't help that the Dodgers played badly on the field. Dodger
players haven't received World Series rings in 14 years, nor reaped
the windfall from postseason play since losing in the first round of
the 1996 playoffs. The 2001 World Series champion Arizona
Diamondbacks added $13 million to their coffers from postseason play.</TE>
<TE>   "Teams with high payrolls need to advance into the playoffs to
keep up with the spending side of the equation," said Jeff Phillips,
senior vice president in the sports investment banking division of
Houlihan, Lokey, Howard &amp; Zukin.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   'A Media Machine'</TE>
<TE>   Staring at mounting losses and a stadium renovation bill likely to
be at least $50 million, the O'Malleys sold the team to Murdoch's
empire. The price: $311 million for the team, $14 million to an
O'Malley charitable foundation and an agreement to assume $25 million
in debt. It was the biggest baseball sale at the time. Daly, a former
Warner Bros. studio chief, later bought 5% and runs the team.</TE>
<TE>   In an interview shortly after the sale, Peter O'Malley said Fox's
ownership would give the team an owner with "broad shoulders" that
could weather baseball's new economic dynamics and that would act
like a showboat "dancing on the roof of the dugout, or in the
clubhouse filling out the lineup card."</TE>
<TE>   Fox and News Corp. had become part of an elite fraternity of
baseball owners less concerned with a club's bottom line than whether
its teams can be leveraged to build TV networks. To them, putting
together a good team is like fixing an apartment building's plumbing.
It's an investment the owner hopes will pay off when the asset is
sold.</TE>
<TE>   Said Daly: "Fox didn't buy the Dodgers because Rupert Murdoch
wanted to come out and watch every game here."</TE>
<TE>   Rather, it was because Fox needed to lock up rights to televise
Dodger games on its regional sports cable network. That would
checkmate Walt Disney Co., which needed the Dodger games to launch
its since-scrapped ESPN West. Disney's decision to pull the plug left
Fox Sports alone with two regional sports cable networks in Southern
California worth hundreds of millions of dollars.</TE>
<TE>   "Murdoch did not view the team as a profit center," said Andrew
Zimbalist, sports economist at Smith College in Northampton, Mass.
"He saw it as a cog in a larger media machine."</TE>
<TE>   He had good reason.</TE>
<TE>   Attendance last year generated $50.7 million of the club's $143.6
million in revenue. Another $50 million came largely from local TV,
national TV, cable and radio. Still another $41 million stemmed from
a host of miscellaneous things such as sales of Dodger Dogs, soft
drinks, parking fees and the rights Budweiser paid to put its name on
the scoreboard.</TE>
<TE>   But a lot more flowed out than in--$189 million. Besides paying
the players, $72.9 million went toward running the stadium,
marketing, administrative costs, scouting and operating the club's
farm system, according to figures supplied to The Times by the
Dodgers.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   An Aging Ballpark</TE>
<TE>   Dodger Stadium, baseball's fourth-oldest, is still popular with
fans. But for the Dodgers, the 40-year-old park has become a
financial burden.</TE>
<TE>   The team is on the hook for all repairs, maintenance, property
taxes, insurance and upgrades. The $67.5 million spent in the last
three years on the stadium includes everything from $1.7 million to
repave and stripe the parking lot to a $2-million sound system and a
$750,000 escalator.</TE>
<TE>   Stadium renovations also included the unfortunately timed
installation of 33 luxury boxes. Priced at $270,000 to $300,000 a
year, one-third of the boxes remain unsold. One reason, the team
says, is that corporations are prime candidates for boxes. But the
corporate headquarters of aerospace, oil, banking, newspaper and
retail companies in Los Angeles washed away in the merger waves of
the 1990s. Demand for Dodger boxes dried up.</TE>
<TE>   It didn't help that the Dodgers hit the luxury box market just
after Staples Center sold 160 boxes to big-spending law firms and
other potential Dodger customers, charging $197,500 to $307,500.</TE>
<TE>   Another unexpected hit occurred when cable giant Adelphia, one of
the team's biggest sponsors, unraveled and filed for U.S. Bankruptcy
Court protection. Adelphia's scandal-tarnished name still adorns the
Dodger Stadium restaurant. Adelphia owes the Dodgers $1.4 million.</TE>
<TE>   Daly also says the stadium's 56,000 capacity works against the
team. Most ballparks seat about 40,000, which the Dodgers argue are
easier to sell out because fans buy tickets early to guarantee that
they will get one. The easiest place to trim seats at Dodger Stadium
would be in the outfield, but Daly concedes that "people love the
bleachers."</TE>
<TE>   Potential fan backlash has the club's hands tied in other areas.</TE>
<TE>   Daly said the club has no plans to sell to a corporation the
rights to rename Dodger Stadium. And ticket prices remain relatively
low: Team Marketing Report newsletter lists the Dodger average ticket
price at $16.38, below the major league average of $18.31.</TE>
<TE>   But despite overall sagging attendance for the sport, the Dodgers
are drawing more, a testament to the team's better on-field
performance. The Dodgers project that attendance will rise by about
80,000, to 3.1 million, this season.</TE>
<TE>   Stanford economist Noll said that while he would no longer label
the team a "Denver mint," the Dodgers' situation is not as dire as it
might seem. The team still shows consistent revenue growth and strong
attendance, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "The Dodgers are not as strong relative to other teams in baseball
as they were in the past, but they still are strong," he said.</TE>
<TE>   While the Dodgers have been winning on the field, the losses in
the offices upstairs raise the question: How patient will Fox be?</TE>
<TE>   There aren't many alternatives. Disposing of the team is
frustrated by the dearth of buyers who have deep pockets or the
desire to lose money. Forbes estimated the Dodgers' value at $435
million. Like any public company, Daly said, Fox would sell the team
to anyone offering a lucrative price.</TE>
<TE>   "Would Fox sell the Dodgers?" Daly said. "I'm sure they would if
the right price came along and the right deal came along. For anybody
to ever say Fox would never sell the Dodgers is naive. I think they
will sell the Dodgers someday."</TE>

<HD>City Hall Gives Adelphia Cool Reception</HD>
<DH>Cable: As the company's contract with L.A. comes up for
renewal, officials are vocal with criticism of the service provider,
which recently filed for bankruptcy protection.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MASSIE RITSCH</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Bruce Springsteen has complained that cable television is 57 channels
with nothin' on. Too many voices with not much to say. That's how
some people might describe what's going on at Los Angeles City Hall
as bankrupt Adelphia Communications Corp. negotiates with the city to
continue providing cable to 250,000 customers here.</LD>
<LD>   Since Adelphia filed for bankruptcy protection in June, Mayor
James K. Hahn and nearly all 15 council members have spoken out about
Southern California's largest cable company and its contract. City
Atty. Rocky Delgadillo has held two news conferences--one outside an
Adelphia office--and has done several radio and TV interviews. All
the elected officials have mixed their opinions and suggestions with
indignation toward the company.</LD>
<LD>   Adelphia lobbyist Howard Sunkin speculates that L.A. politicians
have become so interested in the company's cable TV contract because
the bankruptcy and the arrest of its founders present a local
opportunity for decrying recent corporate scandals.</LD>
<TE>   "The L.A. City Council has only been able to get their teeth into
Adelphia, and that is why it has become a political football here in
Los Angeles," Sunkin said.</TE>
<TE>   Adelphia's franchise agreements with Los Angeles came up for
renewal Aug. 2, nine days after many of its subscribers saw the
founder of the Pennsylvania company and his sons being led away in
handcuffs, accused of bleeding the company dry to finance their own
lavish lifestyles.</TE>
<TE>   Adelphia and the city have worked out an extension of the five
franchises through Sept. 15, pending a review by a City Council
committee. A longer-term agreement would likely require Adelphia to
upgrade its cable networks to deliver digital services such as
high-speed Internet access.</TE>
<TE>   Federal law leaves a city with little leverage in renewing cable
franchises, and some of the politicians' comments during the
negotiations have irritated the city's cable regulators and Adelphia.</TE>
<TE>   The company says Los Angeles is the only market where elected
officials have been so vocal.</TE>
<TE>   Delgadillo has taken the most aggressive approach against
Adelphia, but with mixed results. He got the company to set aside $2
million while it determines how much it owes the city in overdue
franchise fees dating to 1996. But when Delgadillo demanded that
Adelphia give Los Angeles subscribers a rebate, the company ignored
the city attorney and later raised rates by nearly 6%.</TE>
<TE>   Delgadillo's insistence on playing a role in negotiations with
Adelphia, and his fondness for news conferences, have annoyed the
cable regulators in the city's Information Technology Agency. They
complained to the mayor and the City Council that Delgadillo was
being "counterproductive" and, as the city's lawyer, was releasing
information about his client's business that any private attorney
would be bound to keep quiet.</TE>
<TE>   Delgadillo justifies his tactics by pointing out that he also is
charged with representing consumers. "The people who elected me
expect me to stand up for them and their interests," he said. "People
take their cable very seriously."</TE>
<TE>   Councilman Jack Weiss also has urged the city to be a "squeaky
wheel" to ensure the bankrupt company continues to provide television
service in its five franchise areas and pays its fees to the city,
which amount to about $7 million a year. Under Adelphia's bankruptcy
agreement, franchise fees must be paid before all other debts. The
company sent the city its most recent installment July 31, on time.</TE>
<TE>   "If we are not a squeaky wheel in the bankruptcy court, we will be
the victims of the company and the process," Weiss said, adding he
would like a healthier cable company to take over for Adelphia in Los
Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Weiss and others on the council who represent areas served by
Adelphia say constituents from Boyle Heights to Sherman Oaks are
calling to complain about poor service and the $2-a-month rate hike
that surprised most of them earlier this month.</TE>
<TE>   "It's just astonishing to me that they'd have the incredible nerve
to do that," said Kathy Cook, an Adelphia subscriber in West Los
Angeles who complained to Mayor Hahn's and Delgadillo's offices.</TE>
<TE>   Councilman Mark Ridley-Thomas, chairman of the Information
Technology and General Services committee, wants city staff in the
future to alert the council when a cable company plans to raise its
rates.</TE>
<TE>   For Adelphia to raise rates so soon after its founders were
arrested was arrogant, Delgadillo says. He is considering suing
Adelphia's former chairman and chief executive, John Rigas, and his
family.</TE>
<TE>   Adelphia already has sued the Rigases. Regarding the rate hike,
federal regulations allow cable companies an annual increase based on
a standardized formula. Adelphia told the city the increase was
coming four months ago, before the company filed for Chapter 11
bankruptcy protection.</TE>
<TE>   Under federal communications law, cities cannot refuse to renew
cable franchises simply because the company raises its rates, said
Liza Lowery the city's chief information officer. She said
Delgadillo's staff has been telling council members and constituents
that the city has that power, and it does not.</TE>
<TE>   "We cannot hold [Adelphia] hostage like that," she said.</TE>
<TE>   To deny Adelphia's renewal would require a multi-step analysis of
the company's performance. "It's like a trial," Lowery said.</TE>
<TE>   Adelphia says the monthly increase will offset rising programming
costs, and it will not rescind it or offer customers a onetime
rebate. The company plans to remain in the valuable Southern
California market, where it has 1.2 million customers, and pursue
delayed expansions of digital TV and high-speed Internet service,
spokesman Eric Andrus said.</TE>
<TE>   "We're committed to providing uninterrupted service throughout our
restructuring process," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Had Adelphia not been bankrupted by its founding family just
before the company's cable contract came up for renewal, a negotiated
agreement probably would have sailed through the City Council with
little discussion. However, anything related to cable TV is now
getting special scrutiny.</TE>
<TE>   The City Council's summer vacation, which started Friday, could
not come at a better time, said Adelphia lobbyist Sunkin. For two
weeks, all the elected voices might be quiet while the company
continues to negotiate at least a short-term extension with the city.</TE>
<TE>   "Everybody," Sunkin said, "needs to take a deep breath."</TE>

<HD>Back to School With Photo ID Badges</HD>
<DH>Campus: Students at Murrieta Valley High must wear their
tags as part of security measures. Some critics cite privacy
concerns.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DEBORAH SULLIVAN BRENNAN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Along with textbooks, backpacks and binders, students at Murrieta
Valley High School are sporting a new item in their back-to-school
gear: bar-coded photo identification cards slung around their necks.</LD>
<LD>   School officials have asked students to display the ID cards as a
security measure at the sprawling, 4,200-student campus. The tags let
staff members and students know who's who and double as library
cards, student activity passes and Internet access codes.</LD>
<LD>   "I think it's going to be a good tool in order to get to know the
students and greet them, and it contributes to their identity as
Nighthawks," said Principal Renate Jefferson.</LD>
<TE>   Visible ID badges have become a feature of campus security at
schools from Boston to Santa Fe. Some San Diego-area schools now
require students to wear badges, and the Los Angeles Unified School
District may follow suit, said Willie Crittendon, administrator of
school operations and safety.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles high schools now provide voluntary ID badges, and may
require students to carry or wear them this fall, he said. In an era
of widely publicized school violence, the cards test the balance
between students' rights and safety.</TE>
<TE>   School safety experts say the ID cards allow school officials to
stem campus crime by distinguishing between students and unwanted
visitors.</TE>
<TE>   "The school district is trying to address who's on their campus,"
said Kenneth S. Trump, president and chief executive of National
School Safety and Security Services, a Cleveland-based consulting
firm. "That's a very legitimate concern after the school shootings in
recent years, or even concerning schools as terrorist targets. You
need to know who's in your building."</TE>
<TE>   The badges have drawn protests from civil liberties advocates, who
say they're demeaning to students and may reveal too much private
information. "Kids should not be labeled. There's something very
impersonal about wearing an ID tag around your neck," said Liz
Schroeder, associate director of the American Civil Liberties Union
of Southern California.</TE>
<TE>   By contrast, Murrieta Valley High School officials say, the badges
temper the impersonality of a large campus by enabling school staff
to quickly acquaint themselves with students. "It gives us an
opportunity to connect more with students," Jefferson said.</TE>
<TE>   The badges also may help ensure order on the bustling campus. The
school's staggered start and release times have created a continual
flow of students. But with schedules printed on the badges, school
officials can make sure students are in the right places at the right
times.</TE>
<TE>   On the first day of classes at Murrieta Valley High School last
week, students wore the ID cards on bright red lanyards hanging from
their necks, tied to their belts or looped over their back pockets.
Some customized their badges by hanging them from straps printed with
smiley faces or the words, "I love you."</TE>
<TE>   Students greeted the new program with a mixture of appreciation
and grudging acceptance. "I think it's better for us," said freshman
Jamie Piecukonis, 14. "It's safer. In case anything happens to us,
they'll be able to ID us. And we can get to know people by their name
tags."</TE>
<TE>   "I just don't like it. I don't like my picture," said Melani
Thead. But "it's a good idea for safety," she conceded.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, many students who said they disliked the badges objected
solely on grounds of fashion. The red lanyards clash with their
clothes, they complained, and the photos are unflattering.</TE>
<TE>   "It just messes up your outfit. It doesn't look good," said
freshman Kristina Lopez, 14, who wore her badge looped to her jeans
instead of hung over her beige blouse.</TE>
<TE>   Jefferson stressed that no student would face detention or
suspension for failing to wear a badge.</TE>
<TE>   "It's the same thing as a dress code," said Assistant Principal
Mick Wager. "If you remind them, and you're diligent, they get in the
habit of wearing them."</TE>
<TE>   The ACLU's Schroeder said badges printed with students' Social
Security numbers, or even student ID numbers, could constitute an
invasion of privacy.</TE>
<TE>   The Murrieta Valley High School badges were accidentally printed
with students' ID numbers, Jefferson said. The school recognized that
error, though, and is offering students a special pen to block out
that information, she said.</TE>
<TE>   In future years, the cards will bear only students' names; their
ID numbers will be embedded in the bar code, Jefferson said.</TE>
<TE>   But names themselves may be too much information to share, said
Alison Albuquerque, whose 16-year-old son attends the high school.</TE>
<TE>   "We have a big problem in this day and age with stalkers and child
abductors," she said. The badge "has their name, their picture.
That's all you need. One weirdo sees that picture, and they can stalk
them."</TE>
<TE>   Others say the badges can help keep the school secure, as long as
officials don't treat them as a cure-all solution for campus safety.
Campus security officers oversee school safety, and administrators
keep a lookout during breaks and lunch periods, Jefferson said. The
staff also watches entrances during arrival and release times.</TE>
<TE>   But those efforts are not foolproof. In February 2001, a
17-year-old walked onto campus from a nearby high school and stabbed
a 15-year-old student in the chest. The victim survived, but was
hospitalized with injuries.</TE>
<TE>   Jefferson said that single incident did not prompt the ID badge
policy.</TE>
<TE>   "If someone's got a gun, [a badge is] not going to stop them from
shooting you," said John Scott, 16, who recently transferred to
Murrieta Valley High from a Kansas school that also required ID
badges. "It just makes it easier for security to know who's from the
school and who's not."</TE>

<KH>FATHER MICHAEL S. BAKER</KH>
<HD>4 Cases Provide a Glimpse of How Archdiocese Responded</HD>
<DH>Abuser Received New Assignment After Counseling</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>At a series of summer retreats with about 1,100 archdiocese clerics
in the summer of 1986, Cardinal Roger M. Mahony encouraged any priest
with a history of sexual abuse to step forward. Only one man
responded.</LD>
<LD>   Father Michael S. Baker admitted in a private meeting with Mahony
in December 1986 that he had molested young boys.</LD>
<LD>   "I told Mahony I had a problem," Baker said during a series of
interviews. "He was very solicitous and understanding. I was glad I
brought it up."</LD>
<TE>   When asked about the meeting earlier this year, Mahony said on
several occasions that he had no recollection of it. But during a
recent interview, the cardinal recalled that the Baker meeting had
been "very brief. He said he had been involved with two guys.... He
had no last names, and he didn't know where they were. In fact, I
think he said one of them fled to Mexico."</TE>
<TE>   During the 1970s and 1980s, Baker allegedly molested at least nine
boys, documents and interviews show. One man recalled in an interview
that Baker abused him every other weekend for nearly a decade in the
priest's room and on overnight trips.</TE>
<TE>   The cardinal declined to alert police at that time, initiate an
internal investigation or contact priests and parents at the three
parishes where Baker had been assigned. Instead, he sent Baker for
evaluation and counseling at a New Mexico treatment center for
pedophile priests, before reassigning him to restricted ministry.</TE>
<TE>   "I sat down with him again and said, 'One single suspicion, one
single report and you're history,' " Mahony recalled.</TE>
<TE>   Baker was prohibited from having any contact with minors, required
to attend regular counseling sessions and placed under close
supervision, according to a contract with the archdiocese. But soon
he was given temporary assignments to serve as pastor or
administrator at several parishes with elementary schools nearby.</TE>
<TE>   Mahony said Baker should never have been sent to those interim
assignments, adding that his vicar for clergy at the time, Monsignor
Timothy J. Dyer, had made the decisions to place Baker there.</TE>
<TE>   "Those are temporary things that [Dyer] felt were OK to do," Mahony
said.  "I felt, in retrospect, [it was] a terrible thing to do."</TE>
<TE>   Dyer declined to comment about the Baker case.</TE>
<TE>   Mahony said such interim assignments are not normally brought to
his attention. But documents in Baker's file indicate that Mahony
signed off on at least two of the transfers, according to sources
familiar with the Baker case</TE>
<TE>   Baker violated the terms of his agreement with Mahony on three
separate occasions when he was caught alone with minors, according to
archdiocesan sources. In each case, no sexual abuse was found to have
taken place. Instead of being dismissed, Baker was permitted to
continue serving as a priest.</TE>
<TE>   In May 2000, a Tucson attorney sent a letter of complaint
notifying the archdiocese that Baker had continued to molest two
Mexican brothers over a period of 15 years until 1999. The 14-page
letter says Baker sexually abused the boys on trips to Palm Springs,
Arizona and Mexico, as well as in rectories where he stayed in the
Los Angeles Archdiocese.</TE>
<TE>   "No one at the Archdiocese of Los Angeles, including
Cardinal Mahony and Vicar Dyer, reported Baker's sexual abuse of
children...to the authorities, to the parents of the abused children...or
to any other foreseeable victims," the attorney, Lynne M. Cadigan, wrote
in the letter of complaint.</TE>
<TE>   After receiving the letter, attorneys for the archdiocese and
Baker offered to settle quickly and quietly, Cadigan said. The two
parties agreed to pay a combined $1.3 million, sources said.</TE>
<TE>   As part of the deal, lawyers for the archdiocese and Baker
insisted that all terms of the settlement be kept strictly
confidential, Cadigan said.</TE>
<TE>   Mahony confirmed that, after receiving the complaint, no one at
the archdiocese reported Baker to authorities. "It was just our
expectation that the two brothers had gone to police because they
were so angry at him," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Cadigan said it had been made clear to the victims that the
archdiocese and Baker were buying their silence. "There was no way
they would pay that kind of money with the expectation that my
clients would go to the police or make it public," Cadigan said.</TE>
<TE>   Baker resigned from the priesthood in December 2000. The following
month, Monsignor Richard A. Loomis wrote a note in Baker's file,
saying he had learned that the former priest had acknowledged
molesting as many as 10 victims in the 1970s and 1980s, the sources
said. Once again, no one alerted authorities.</TE>
<TE>   In late March of this year, the cardinal authorized an archdiocese
lawyer to notify police about Baker. Until then, according to a
confidential e-mail sent by Sister Judith Ann Murphy, Mahony had been
"reluctant" to tell authorities about what officials consider their
most embarrassing and egregious case of sexual misconduct by a
priest.</TE>
<TE>   "I have to be honest with you," the cardinal said in an interview.
"There is absolutely nothing good about the Baker case. Just
absolutely nothing."</TE>

<HD>Robert Borkenstein, 89; Inventor of Breathalyzer
Intoxication Tester</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELAINE WOO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Robert F. Borkenstein, whose Breathalyzer has helped snare millions
of intoxicated drivers in the United States and around the world,
died Aug. 10 at his home in Bloomington, Ind.</LD>
<LD>   He was 89 and had been in declining health after a series of
strokes.</LD>
<LD>   Borkenstein was a professor of forensic studies at Indiana
University for three decades, until his retirement in the late 1980s.
He helped establish a class on alcohol and highway safety that became
a requirement for law enforcement and forensic specialists in many
jurisdictions. The university now calls it "The Borkenstein Course."</LD>
<TE>   He also led several influential research projects, the best known
of which was the Grand Rapids Study, in 1963-64. That study
established that a blood alcohol level of .08 could impair driving.
The legal standard for intoxication now applied in California and
other states is .08, lower by half than the benchmark used by law
enforcement before the study.</TE>
<TE>   But Borkenstein was best known as the inventor of the
Breathalyzer, the first practical instrument for determining blood
alcohol in the field.</TE>
<TE>   Although it no longer dominates the market, it was the standard
for so many years that it earned its own dictionary entry, alongside
such household names as Teflon and Kleenex.</TE>
<TE>   "A trademark used for a device that detects and measures alcohol
in expired air," says the American Heritage Dictionary in the entry
for Borkenstein's invention.</TE>
<TE>   "He was famous for good applied science," said Hillard Trubitt, a
retired Indiana University professor who worked under Borkenstein for
25 years.</TE>
<TE>   Borkenstein was also a sought-after expert on the polygraph and
administered more than 15,000 lie detection tests during his career.</TE>
<TE>   A native of Fort Wayne, Ind., Borkenstein began working as a
photographer for the Indiana State Police in 1936. He demonstrated a
natural talent in science that quickly led him to become the director
of the state police laboratory, even though he lacked a college
degree.</TE>
<TE>   While serving as lab director, he began an association with
Indiana University, where he collaborated with toxicology professor
Rolla N. Harger on the Drunkometer, the first accurate instrument for
testing the breath to determine blood alcohol.</TE>
<TE>   Before its invention in 1938, law enforcement relied on blood
tests for scientific evidence of intoxication.</TE>
<TE>   The Drunkometer took advantage of the fact that alcohol consumed
by a person enters the bloodstream, goes through the lungs and is
exhaled. The concentration of alcohol in deep lung air is related to
the level of alcohol in the blood.</TE>
<TE>   Harger's device required a person suspected of excessive drinking
to blow into a balloon, which was transported to a laboratory for
analysis.</TE>
<TE>   The suspect's breath was passed through a fluid containing a
chemical reagent, which changed color, according to the level of
alcohol present.</TE>
<TE>   The fluid's hue then had to be compared with a chart color-coded
to the chemical reactions triggered by various levels of blood
alcohol.</TE>
<TE>   It was a time-consuming and cumbersome process whose results
relied heavily on the visual acuity of the person analyzing the test.</TE>
<TE>   "The Drunkometer was magnificent technology for the time," said
Trubitt. "But you couldn't take it out on the road. And an awful lot
of variables could go wrong."</TE>
<TE>   Borkenstein wanted to "automate that process and compact it in
such a way that you didn't require an entire laboratory to do this
thing," Trubitt said.</TE>
<TE>   What he came up with, in 1954, was the Breathalyzer, a compound of
the words breath, alcohol and analyzer. Instead of balloons that
could slip out of an officer's hand, the Breathalyzer used a rubber
hose connected to a vial that captured the person's breath. It also
incorporated a meter to perform the color comparisons that, with the
Drunkometer, had to be done by eye.</TE>
<TE>   The Breathalyzer was marketed in 1958 and quickly became a success
because it was portable and reliable, removed significant human
error, and didn't require a PhD to operate.</TE>
<TE>   It was routinely installed in police cars, and developed such a
strong reputation for accuracy that some suspects took desperate
measures to foil it: A Canadian man was reported to have eaten his
underwear in the back of a patrol car while waiting for a
Breathalyzer test to be administered, hoping the cotton fabric would
absorb the alcohol in his system. According to a newspaper report, he
was acquitted, but only after several rows of courtroom spectators
had to be ushered out for laughing so hard that they were in tears.</TE>
<TE>   Borkenstein joined the faculty of Indiana University in 1958 after
22 years as head of the state police lab. He later became chairman of
the forensic studies department and director of the university's
Center for Studies of Law in Action.</TE>
<TE>   He was known as a generous mentor with a wide-ranging intelligence
for whom no question was unworthy of an answer.</TE>
<TE>   Loren Reuter, an attorney who was Borkenstein's course director in
the 1980s, once wondered how gold plating was done. "For the next
hour, he sat there and explained it to me in great detail. You would
never go see him unless you had an hour or so to spend," Reuter
recalled.</TE>
<TE>   When Borkenstein finally pursued his bachelor's degree in the late
1950s, he chose a double major in police administration and French.
He never studied for an advanced degree, but ultimately was awarded
two honorary doctorates, including an LL.D., or doctor of laws, from
Indiana University.</TE>
<TE>   A Francophile, he was passionate about Paris and traveled
extensively with his wife, Marjorie, an author of children's books,
who died in 1998. They had no children.</TE>
<TE>   He was keen on Gilbert and Sullivan, loved literature, and was an
excellent bartender with eclectic tastes in wine and liquor.</TE>
<TE>   But he practiced what he preached. "He certainly wasn't a
teetotaler," said Reuter. "But I never saw him abuse it, either. He
knew it helped people enjoy things."</TE>
<TE>   Borkenstein held the patent for the Breathalyzer for most of his
life, finally selling the rights several years ago to a Colorado
company that markets the machine.</TE>
<TE>   "If we can make life better simply by controlling alcohol, that's
a very small price to pay," Borkenstein once told an interviewer. "My
whole life's work has been spent trying to make life better for
people."</TE>
<TE>   He invented many other gadgets. In 1970, he introduced a
coin-operated Breathalyzer that could be installed in cocktail
lounges. For 25 cents, a person could blow into a straw that popped
out of the machine.</TE>
<TE>   A reading of .04 or less would prompt the message "Be a safe
driver." A reading between .05 and .09 blinked out "Be a good
walker." A score of .10 or higher: "You're a passenger."</TE>

<HD>2 Sides Size Up Political Benefits of Secession</HD>
<DH>Breakup: Supporters say smaller cities could fare better
with state and federal grants. Hahn says they would lose clout.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PATRICK McGREEVY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In the debate over the breakup of Los Angeles, Mayor James K. Hahn
has argued that smaller cities will get less attention in Washington
and Sacramento, and therefore a vote in favor of secession ultimately
would hurt those who benefit from state and federal programs.</LD>
<LD>   Secession advocates disagree, with some arguing that competition
between Los Angeles and Hollywood and San Fernando Valley cities
would help all the areas get more.</LD>
<LD>   Each side in the argument marshals some evidence to support its
contention. Secession opponents cite examples where Los Angeles
appears to have benefited from its size. Secession supporters counter
that even when the city gets money, it does not always use it in ways
that adequately benefit Hollywood or the Valley.</LD>
<TE>   "There is no question in my mind that being the second-largest
city in America brings some attention to Los Angeles," Hahn said.</TE>
<TE>   The city received more and quicker federal financial help--more
than $11 billion--for the 1994 Northridge earthquake than San
Francisco did for the Loma Prieta temblor, for instance. Los Angeles
also received state and federal money, including a $400-million
federal loan, to help build the $2.5-billion Alameda Corridor rail
expressway linking the harbor and the downtown rail yards.</TE>
<TE>   And when the Clinton administration announced in 1998 that
California would get $144 million to hire 792 more police officers,
$133 million of that amount--enough for 710 officers--was allocated
to Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   In some cases, the size of those grants reflects Los Angeles'
needs as much as it does the city's political influence or
population. But some federal officials say the city's size clearly
has helped it reel in some important grants.</TE>
<TE>   When Los Angeles needed help recovering from the 1992 riots and
1994 quake, for instance, the federal government provided $450
million in grants and loan guarantees to start up a Community
Development Bank to finance businesses in economically depressed
areas of the city.</TE>
<TE>   Many large cities that were smaller than Los Angeles did not get
similar banks, said Henry Cisneros, former secretary of the U.S.
Department of Housing and Urban Development and former mayor of San
Antonio.</TE>
<TE>   Cisneros said he opposes secession because he believes the city's
clout will be diminished.</TE>
<TE>   "When Los Angeles came to Washington in force, it was a
command-performance moment for Cabinet officers," Cisneros said. "You
certainly wouldn't do that for Hollywood. Whether you would do that
for the Valley is questionable."</TE>
<TE>   Rep. Xavier Becerra (D-Los Angeles) said if the Valley wants more
transit dollars for its area, it currently can count on 13 members of
Congress who represent Los Angeles to help. If the Valley becomes its
own city, it would have as few as three members of Congress, Becerra
said.</TE>
<TE>   "If you break up into fragments, it's more difficult to advocate
for the same amount of the pie," Becerra said, adding that the cause
also may be complicated if the Valley city and Los Angeles have
different funding priorities in Washington.</TE>
<TE>   Secession leaders, including former state Assemblyman Richard
Katz, said a Valley city, with 1.35 million people, and Los Angeles,
which would be left with 2.3 million people, could still hold sway in
Washington and Sacramento if they worked together.</TE>
<TE>   "It's ridiculous," Katz said of the claim of reduced clout. "If
your third-and sixth-largest cities push together, they will have a
tremendous amount of clout."</TE>
<TE>   Lobbyist Fred Gaines, chairman of the Valley Industry and Commerce
Assn., said more resources might be won "if you have two cities of a
million-plus people."</TE>
<TE>   The two or three cities still would be represented by the same
congressional delegation in Washington and the same state legislators
in Sacramento, Katz said.</TE>
<TE>   Still, J. Brent Eidson, deputy director of government affairs for
San Diego, said Los Angeles definitely has more pull in Sacramento
than does his city.</TE>
<TE>   He points to Proposition 40, the March state parks bond, in which
Los Angeles legislators were able to write in several projects for
their area, while smaller cities received little in comparison. The
ballot measure earmarked $40 million each to the Santa Monica
Mountains and Baldwin Hills conservancies but nothing for the San
Diego area.</TE>
<TE>   But, federal and state records indicate that size does not always
matter for cities.</TE>
<TE>   The Federal Transit Administration provides an amount to each city
based on a formula that includes population. Because secession would
not affect the region's overall population, that federal help would
not diminish if Los Angeles was broken into two or three cities.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, Los Angeles does not do as well as some smaller cities in
transit funding where federal legislators earmark money through the
political process.</TE>
<TE>   Under the category of new projects, Los Angeles this year received
$16.5 million for the Eastside light rail system and the remaining
North Hollywood subway extension bills.</TE>
<TE>   San Diego--the nation's seventh-largest city with a population of
1.2 million--received $59 million for its Mission Valley East light
rail system. San Francisco received $74.9 million to extended its
BART system to the airport.</TE>
<TE>   Legislators and political clout also play a role in earmarking
funds for bus projects. Los Angeles this year received $3.7 million
for its rapid bus system, while San Francisco, with a population of
nearly 800,000, received $3.9 million, and Houston, with a population
of 1.9 million, received $5.4 million.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles received less community development block grant
money--anti-poverty funding--than Chicago, the nation's third-largest
city and less per capita than both Chicago and San Francisco, records
indicate.</TE>
<TE>   Katz said Los Angeles has a reputation of not doing as well as
other cities in Washington.</TE>
<TE>   "Frankly, the California delegation is infamous for not working
closely together," he said.</TE>
<TE>   In the state Legislature, Los Angeles' clout has meant the last
three Assembly speakers have come from the area.</TE>
<TE>   Former Assembly Speaker Bob Hertzberg (D-Sherman Oaks) said he
opposes secession but doubts the breakup of Los Angeles would reduce
the area's clout in Sacramento.</TE>
<TE>   "I just don't think that argument holds water," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The state legislators from Los Angeles County have failed to form
a united front on issues in the past, Hertzberg said.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles' huge bureaucracy is partly to blame, Katz said,
adding that it is too slow and not efficient enough to compete well
for federal and state dollars. Breaking up the city into three
municipalities will result in leaner, more-efficient city governments
that would be more agile when competing for funds, he said.</TE>
<TE>   While agreeing that Los Angeles' elected leaders have not always
presented a united front, Hahn said, "I think the Valley is going to
be less successful competing with Los Angeles for federal dollars,
especially those meant for urban areas. The Valley probably gets more
attention because it is part of Los Angeles."</TE>
<TE>   But Katz said that when Los Angeles wins block grant money, little
of the money goes to the Valley, even though there are pockets of
serious poverty there.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the $91 million in federal block grant funds received this
year goes to citywide programs, but a large amount is earmarked by
council district.</TE>
<TE>   A review of city records found that the average community
development block grant allocation to the four council districts
wholly in the Valley before recent redistricting is $275,206, while
the average received by the eight districts wholly out of the Valley
is $1.9 million.</TE>
<TE>   The West Valley's 3rd and 12th Districts each got $43,900, the
lowest amount earmarked for districts, while the largest amount was
$5.2 million allocated to East Los Angeles' 14th District,
represented by Nick Pacheco, chairman of the council's budget
committee.</TE>
<TE>   Edward Baker of the city Community Development Department said the
disparity reflects the fact that the distribution of the money "is
meant to address issues associated with the incidence of poverty."</TE>
<TE>   Katz said federal rules requiring neighborhoods receiving
anti-poverty help to be contiguous means the Valley doesn't get the
funding it needs. Having the Valley compete separately likely would
yield better results for the Valley's poor, he said.</TE>

<HD>Assembly GOP Leader Hones Balancing Act</HD>
<DH>Politics: Dave Cox has lasted in the 'minefield' post
longer than most predecessors and kept caucus united against tax
hikes in budget battle.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JULIE TAMAKI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>One need only enter the office of Assembly Republican Leader Dave Cox
and glance at the portraits of his predecessors to realize that Cox
has accomplished something special.</LD>
<LD>   There's a photo of Bill Leonard of San Bernardino, who lasted as
leader for a little more than 14 months, and one of Rod Pacheco of
Riverside, who held the post for five months--a couple of weeks
longer than Bill Campbell of Villa Park.</LD>
<LD>   Leading the Assembly's minority caucus is a task so difficult that
state Sen. Ross Johnson of Irvine, who previously held the post, once
described it as "walking through the minefield, juggling hand
grenades and herding cats." Previous leaders have either been ousted
or have quit for issues ranging from not raising enough money to the
caucus losing too many legislative districts during elections to
being perceived as reluctant to take on Gov. Gray Davis.</LD>
<TE>   When Cox, who hails from the Sacramento suburb of Fair Oaks, was
chosen as leader in March 2001, he became the fifth GOP lawmaker to
be tapped for the post within four years. Yet as he prepares to mark
his 17th month in the job, Cox and his fractious caucus remain united
against the Democrats' $4-billion tax package.</TE>
<TE>   Republicans are calling for a like amount of spending cuts to wipe
out the need for tax hikes to help close a $23.6-billion budget gap.</TE>
<TE>   GOP opposition to new taxes has pushed Cox and his conservative
counterparts into the limelight in the Capitol, where a battle over
the tax plan is holding up passage of a new state budget, which was
due July 1. Democrats who control the Assembly need four of the 30
Republicans to vote with them to approve the plan.</TE>
<TE>   That has got budget watchers wondering how long Cox, a former
municipal utility board member and Sacramento County supervisor, can
continue to hold his caucus together. Observers are intrigued that
Cox, 64, has managed this long and believe he is on track to exceed
Scott Baugh's recent achievement of holding on to the Assembly
Republican leadership post for 19 months.</TE>
<TE>   "It's surprising and a tribute to his tenacity," said Steve
Szalay, executive director of the California State Assn. of Counties.
"Dave has taken on this very challenging and difficult role of
minority leader the same way he has taken on problems at the local
level where he was very skilled as a supervisor in Sacramento
County."</TE>
<TE>   Kevin Gordon, executive director of the California Assn. of School
Business Officials, describes Cox as a man who is easy to work with.</TE>
<TE>   "Now we wish we could get a vote on the budget," Gordon said. "But
we know he doesn't control all of the votes in his caucus."</TE>
<TE>   What Cox does get a nod for is possessing a willingness to reach
out to his entire caucus, including its more conservative and
outspoken members. Fans also cite his folksy charm and fascination
with fiscal policy as assets. In a field littered with demonstrative
characters, Cox is known as a listener.</TE>
<TE>   "I would rather crawl across broken glass then play poker with
Dave Cox," said Dan Schnur, a GOP strategist who works with the
Assembly Republican Caucus. "I have never seen anyone in politics
better at keeping his cards close to his vest."</TE>
<TE>   Democrats cite the same trait, however, as a reason why Cox has
proven to be a frustrating opponent in the current budget battle.
They describe him as being unwilling to negotiate or compromise.</TE>
<TE>   Assemblyman Darrell Steinberg (D-Sacramento), who is involved in
budget matters for his caucus, describes Cox as a good and caring
person. But Steinberg said it's unfortunate that Cox and his caucus
lack the ability to help sort through the state's fiscal mess.</TE>
<TE>   "The problem is that their consistent mantra is that there not be
a dime of new revenue. That's just unrealistic both in this year and
in terms of solving the structural deficit."</TE>
<TE>   A multibillion drop in state revenues caused in part by the burst
of the Silicon Valley tech bubble and a decline in the stock market
have contributed to a $23.6-billion budget gap, which state officials
are struggling to close.</TE>
<TE>   During the current budget standoff, Cox has held regular meetings
with reporters to remind them that the state has a spending problem
created by Gov. Gray Davis and his fellow Democrats.</TE>
<TE>   Cox recently compared Davis to a dog loose in a henhouse who's
taken to sucking eggs--an anecdote he conjured up to describe what he
says is the governor's bad habit of trying to peel off his members to
get a budget approved rather than negotiating a deal with GOP
leaders.</TE>
<TE>   "We are not the ones holding this budget up," Cox said. "The
governor has got to get engaged. It's unfortunate that his leadership
style doesn't allow him to get engaged in serious issues."</TE>
<TE>   Republicans cite the fact that California's nonpartisan
legislative analyst Elizabeth Hill is projecting revenue shortfalls
of about $45 billion over the next five years as a reason why
spending cuts--not tax hikes--are necessary for the state to start
living within its means.</TE>
<TE>   Democrats contend that taxes that were cut when times were good
should now be allowed to rise to help keep the state out of the red.
At stake, they contend, is the state's ability to provide health care
to the poor and cost of living increases to the blind, elderly and
disabled. Cutting key services to eliminate the need for tax hikes,
they add, is unacceptable.</TE>
<TE>   "What Dave Cox wants, I can't give," said Assembly Speaker Herb
Wesson (D-Culver City), who counts Cox as a friend. "What Dave wants
destroys the core Democratic values, and that's cuts of such a
dramatic nature that it would devastate services that we feel
strongly about providing."</TE>
<TE>   For his part, Cox credits his staff and leadership team for his
success to date in keeping his caucus together in its fight for no
new taxes.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not sure when you're in the minority you have the ability to
be dictatorial," Cox said. "It has to be a participatory style
because in order for you to accomplish anything you have to stick
together.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm enjoying the aspect that our cause remains united."</TE>
<TE>   Within his party, Cox is known as a communicator who works hard to
keep members informed and feeling that they're part of the caucus.
Last year, for example, after four Assembly Republicans bolted from
their caucus and voted with Democrats for the budget, Cox focused on
bringing them back into the fold.</TE>
<TE>   So far, he has succeeded with two of the four, including
Assemblyman Anthony Pescetti of Rancho Cordova. Pescetti credits Cox
and his staff with laying out the structural problems with the budget
and for allowing everyone in the caucus to speak his mind.</TE>
<TE>   "As contentious as it sometimes gets, when it's all done, people
are on the same page," Pescetti said. "Dave puts a big emphasis on
communication."</TE>
<TE>   That approach has helped Cox foster a healthy relationship with
Senate Republican Leader Jim Brulte of Rancho Cucamonga.</TE>
<TE>   "Other than when Bill Leonard was the Republican leader in the
Assembly, I think I talk to Dave Cox on a daily basis more than I
talked with previous Republican leaders on a weekly basis," Brulte
said.</TE>
<TE>   Brulte tells a charming tale of when Cox was first tapped to be
leader and told Brulte he wanted to work closely with him. Brulte in
turn told Cox they'd be "joined at the hip."</TE>
<TE>   When Cox got wind that Brulte was planning on flying into
California with newly elected President George W. Bush, Brulte said
Cox showed up in his office and said: "I hear you're flying into
California with the president on Air Force One. What happened to us
being joined at the hip?"</TE>
<TE>   "We both flew on Air Force One into California with the
president," Brulte said.</TE>
<TE>   During the plane ride, Brulte said Bush teased him by saying he
had some bad news. Bush wanted to appoint Brulte to an
ambassadorship, but so far he couldn't find a country that wanted
him.</TE>
<TE>   Without missing a beat, Brulte recalled how Cox told Bush: "Mr.
President, don't give up."</TE>
<TE>   "He hasn't been on Air Force One since," Brulte noted with a
chuckle.</TE>

<HD>Council Delays Initiative, Is Sued</HD>
<DH>Election: Measure would change the way Huntington Beach
officials are chosen. City moves it back to the March 2004 ballot.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STANLEY ALLISON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A supporter of a ballot measure that would reshape the Huntington
Beach City Council has filed suit against the council, demanding that
the initiative be placed on the November ballot.</LD>
<LD>   The initiative, which would reduce the number of council members
to five from seven and replace the citywide election system with
district elections, qualified to be on the ballot in November.</LD>
<LD>   But council members, some of whom oppose the proposal, decided
instead to place it on the March 2004 ballot.</LD>
<TE>   A hearing on the issue will be held in Superior Court on
Wednesday. Councilwoman Connie Boardman said the council decided on
the March ballot because measure opponents needed time to investigate
whether the initiative would withstand a legal challenge. The
majority of the council also wanted to give opponents time to mount
an effective campaign.</TE>
<TE>   Because the measure would not take effect until November 2004, "it
was reasonable to postpone" the vote, Boardman said.</TE>
<TE>   She said the group formed to fight the measure has raised only
$1,500 while proponents have raised nearly $100,000. "We need to give
the community a chance to get their side out," she said.</TE>
<TE>   But Joe Jeffrey, who gathered more than 500 signatures for the
ballot, sees the council's move as pure politics.</TE>
<TE>   "I told ... people, 'Give us enough signatures, and we'll have it
on the November ballot' " Jeffrey said. "It makes me look like I lied
to them, and I had nothing to do with it."</TE>
<TE>   Scott Baugh, the former assemblyman who wrote the measure, also
expressed anger over the delay.</TE>
<TE>   "When you go out and collect 22,000 signatures in order to qualify
for the November election, you have every reason to believe it will
be on the November election," Baugh said. "It's an abuse of the
process for the City Council ... to kick the election over for a year
and a half to give the opponents time to mount their campaign."</TE>
<TE>   Baugh said the current council system, in which seven members are
elected at-large, has favored coastal and environmental issues at the
expense of inland concerns.</TE>
<TE>   The result, he said, has been a "billion-dollar infrastructure
problem related to sewers and roads."</TE>
<TE>   His solution would be to have five council members elected by
districts.</TE>
<TE>   District representation would make council members more
accountable to residents and reduce the cost of running for office,
he said.</TE>
<TE>   Council members say Baugh's effort is a blatant attempt by
business interests to gain control of the council. That allegation
was fueled by the disclosure that a contributor to the campaign is
the AES Corp., which owns a power plant in Huntington Beach.</TE>
<TE>   AES and the city have had a rocky relationship for years. During
last year's energy crisis, AES received fast-track approval from the
state to restart two generators at the Huntington Beach plant that
had been idle since 1995. The council unsuccessfully fought the move,
saying the generators would cause excessive pollution and noise.</TE>

<HD>Turning a Wasteland Into a Desert</HD>
<DH>Environment: Health inspector has removed 5,000 tons of
trash from areas long used as illegal dumping grounds.</DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Los Angeles County health inspector Chris Mastro is one of the few
people on Earth who can find Sam Smith's tumbledown trailer among the
creosote and Joshua trees of the vast Mojave Desert, far from the
nearest sign of civilization.</LD>
<LD>   Smith, a 66-year-old retiree with skin as brown as a roasted
coffee bean, runs his appliances off a jury-rigged wind generator and
a few solar panels. And he tosses his garbage into a pile behind his
tiny homestead.</LD>
<LD>   Even though no one else may ever see it, the garbage is Mastro's
problem. For five years, his job has been to clean up the middle of
nowhere.</LD>
<TE>   He has directed the removal of 5,000-plus tons of illegally dumped
trash from the Mojave in an effort to restore an environment that
generations of Southern Californians have literally considered their
wasteland.</TE>
<TE>   "Sam," Mastro barked cheerfully on a recent visit, the afternoon
heat hovering well above 100 degrees, "What do you say I get you a
few bags so you can clean up all that stuff back there?"</TE>
<TE>   Mastro's job was created as part of a broad effort to address
illegal dumping in the High Desert, a problem that has grown worse in
recent decades.</TE>
<TE>   Historically, people from as far away as Orange County have
avoided costly dumping fees by unloading everything from old tires to
demolished homes in the desert. Before the establishment of legal
landfills, desert dwellers like Smith discarded their garbage in
improvised local dumps, some of which are still in use and now
contain hundreds of tons of trash.</TE>
<TE>   The population boom of the 1980s in the Antelope Valley brought
more trash with it.</TE>
<TE>   In the early 1990s, when the recession and the resulting
foreclosures hit, fly-by-night companies came through communities
like Lake Los Angeles to clean trash and old furnishings out of
abandoned homes--only to illegally dump it nearby. A few years later,
as those communities began to grow again, the desert was plagued with
piles of construction waste.</TE>
<TE>   Palmdale and Lancaster, which saw respective population gains of
69.5% and 22% in the 1990s, began to take notice of the huge heaps of
junk and developed plans with the county to attack the problem. An
effort also was made to change what local environmentalist Jane
Williams calls the "desert rat" mind set, which holds that the Mojave
is big enough to absorb such abuse.</TE>
<TE>   The county created the Antelope Valley Illegal Dumping Task Force
in 1996 to encourage residents to bring specific trash problems to
health officials.</TE>
<TE>   Today, Los Angeles County sheriff's volunteers patrol known
illegal dump sites, students are taught that desert dumping is wrong
and the Antelope Valley annually celebrates an "Environmental Pride
Week."</TE>
<TE>   Residents like Janet Byrum of Lancaster said the efforts have
begun to pay off. "Though it's not cleaner than it was in 1967, it's
definitely cleaner than it was in 1999," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Mastro's efforts have made the biggest impact, task force Chairman
Larry Levine says.</TE>
<TE>   For Mastro, the job is primarily detective work. In his
700-square-mile coverage area that encompasses some of the most
desolate terrain in the region, rumored dump sites are hard to
pinpoint.</TE>
<TE>   Mastro once discovered a decades-old site containing 1,800 tons of
waste, only because he noticed a strange gleam near a remote butte as
he was driving home. It turned out to be the sun shining on fields of
broken glass.</TE>
<TE>   Finding property owners also can be difficult. A few blocks from
Byrum's Lancaster home, Mastro has tried to clear a dump site spread
over nine separately owned empty lots. Because it is private
property, he can't just clean the stuff up. First, he has to attempt
to coerce the owners into doing it themselves.</TE>
<TE>   A problem with these parcels--and a common one throughout the
desert--is that few owners live nearby. One is in San Francisco, one
is in Indiana, another is in Japan. "Sometimes, they don't even know
it's theirs," Mastro said.</TE>
<TE>   If he doesn't get a response to letters to the property owners,
Mastro could go through the lengthy process of taking them to court.
But, he said, it's often better to declare the site a health hazard
and send in a county prison crew to clean it up.</TE>
<TE>   "And when I get this done, I can say, 'I did it,' " said Mastro,
40. "Not a lot of people can say that."</TE>
<TE>   An environmental biologist, Mastro jumped at the offer to take the
job five years ago. As a resident of a little town in the northern
San Bernardino Mountains, he said he considers the desert his big
backyard.</TE>
<TE>   Because of the enormity of the problem, Mastro said he quickly
learned to focus on the most dangerous, well-known and largest sites.
Using more than $500,000 in state grants, four of the area's largest
illegal dumps have been cleared and three more will be when funding
becomes available, he said. Other, smaller problems are often solved
with the help of landlords, or with the occasional knock on the door
of a suspected litterbug.</TE>
<TE>   Many people he meets on the desert's far-flung dirt roads tend to
be fiercely independent types who oppose proposals to bring mandatory
trash service to unincorporated areas, a move Mastro said would
reduce illegal dumping. But he has also developed a respect for
people like Smith, who have been able to function so far off the
grid.</TE>
<TE>   "People in these rural areas have their own wells, their own
generators--they're like the pioneers, almost," he said. "They figure
they can take care of their own trash too."</TE>
<TE>   Although it's impossible to estimate how much garbage remains on
the desert floor, Mastro thinks it's declining, in part because the
big dump sites he has cleaned up have stayed empty.</TE>
<TE>   Last week, Mastro plowed his pickup truck across the desert to
show off the site where he had seen the gleam of broken glass. In
June 2000, a crew under his direction spent $150,000 to rid the area
of asbestos, contaminated ash and other dangerous materials.</TE>
<TE>   Today, it is indistinguishable from the miles of desert that
stretch to the horizon.</TE>

<HD>O.C.'s 'Dyke March' Is Small But Spirited</HD>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A small turnout marked Orange County's first "Dyke March" and rally,
but organizers said Saturday's low attendance will not deter them
from staging the event next year.</LD>
<LD>   The march was billed as an opportunity for lesbians to empower
themselves by becoming more visible in a county that has not always
been tolerant of homosexuality.</LD>
<LD>   But only about 100 people, including male backers, showed up at
the rally, which was held at Lions Park in Costa Mesa. Men were not
allowed to join the street march but were encouraged to show their
support from the sidewalks with placards or banners.</LD>
<TE>   "Our event is about empowerment and visibility. If only 10 people
come, we've achieved our goal," said spokeswoman Katie Profeta.</TE>
<TE>   Private guards provided heavy security for the rally, and there
were no incidents or protesters. A free-speech area set aside for
opponents went unused. Some entertainers also failed to show.</TE>
<TE>   Profeta, 24, said organizers purposely billed the rally as an
event for "dykes," despite the word's generally pejorative usage.</TE>
<TE>   "We're using 'dyke' to reclaim the word and make it a positive
theme, so it won't be used to hurt us," said Profeta. "Dykes don't
have to be harassed. We want them to feel secure in Orange County."</TE>
<TE>   Most attendees were younger women, including some high school
students who are openly gay.</TE>
<TE>   The low turnout was a disappointment to some.</TE>
<TE>   "It's really bad. That's why I'm not [taking part in the rally],"
said Maya Solano, 28, who was sitting on the grass with her partner,
Sunny Hennesey, 25. Both women are from Los Angeles. "The booths
don't have any interesting or educational stuff to hand out. It's
sad."</TE>
<TE>   Nevertheless, Solano and Hennesey stuck around to lend their moral
support. The women have been dating for six months.</TE>
<TE>   "These things are helpful because they educate people about
lesbians. A lot of people think that two women together are just
trying to fulfill their sexual fantasies. They don't realize that
it's a true and strong love."</TE>
<TE>   One 18-year-old said she is still looking for a way to tell her
parents she is gay. The Long Beach resident attended the march hoping
to get some advice, from "someone who's been in my shoes," about how
best to break the news to her family.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not easy. I think my mom knows. But I'm dreading having to
out myself to my parents. I don't know how my dad's going to handle
it," she said.</TE>
<TE>   She said she is also uncomfortable being branded a dyke. She
prefers lesbian.</TE>
<TE>   Profeta said she understood the predicament, especially about the
word "dyke."</TE>
<TE>   "I hope that someday we won't need words to describe who we are. I
hope that someday we will all be known simply as men and women, and
that our sexuality won't matter," she said.</TE>

<HD>Park's Paths Less Traveled</HD>
<DH>Tour: Fans of local history go on guided walk to
remote--and run-down--areas of Elysian Park.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CARA MIA DiMASSA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A group of L.A. history buffs gathered at the eastern edge of Elysian
Park Saturday to learn about the lesser-known parts of the city's
oldest park.</LD>
<LD>   What they got was both a lesson in the park's rich history and an
education in the modern realities of park maintenance in a city
struggling with limited funding, a hiring freeze and the
responsibility of caring for a place that is at once a modern-day
park and a historic relic.</LD>
<LD>   Elysian Park was dedicated in 1886. Construction began on the
eastern entrance, which was marked by a monument to explorer and
politician John Fremont soon after. In his book "The Los Angeles
River," Blake Gumprecht suggests that city officials' reasons for
transforming the area into a public space were less than altruistic.
The "city officials decided to create Elysian Park on 746 acres of
hill land west of the river," he wrote, "because the property ...
could not be given away."</LD>
<TE>   On Saturday, Scott Fajack, president of the Citizens Committee to
Save Elysian Park, met a group of 14 at the head of the Portola
Trail, named after Gaspar de Portola, one of the first Europeans to
visit the site, for a two-hour walking tour.</TE>
<TE>   The tour, one of three walking tours offered on a rotating basis
by the Echo Park Historical Society, focused on the 30 acres that
were cut off from the rest of the larger park, just under 600 acres,
by the completion of the Pasadena Freeway in 1953. The parkland on
the other side of the freeway, which houses Dodger Stadium and the
Police Academy, "doesn't have a lot of history," Fajack said.</TE>
<TE>   As traffic whooshed by and the occasional freight train clanked
along the network of tracks approaching downtown, Fajack told the
group about the history of the park's eastern edge.</TE>
<TE>   He showed off the former site of the Buena Vista Reservoir, in
whose guard house William Mulholland once lived. He pulled out
architectural sketches of the 1893 Elysian Park Pumping Station,
which was replaced by a more modern structure in the 1990s. And he
displayed color copies of postcards depicting the massive pigeon farm
that supplied squab to downtown restaurants from 1892 until it was
destroyed by flood in 1914.</TE>
<TE>   But Fajack also acknowledged that what the group was looking at
didn't compare to the way the park once was. "It doesn't seem very
inviting now," he said apologetically, as he pointed out the site
where a brick structure once stood, now replaced by a metal storage
unit.</TE>
<TE>   Due in part to the passive nature of the park, he said, it has
become a refuge for transients and a spot for cruising. The Citizens
Committee, along with the Echo Park Historical Society, helps the
city clear dead vegetation in an effort to discourage people from
hiding out in the park.</TE>
<TE>   But there are other problems. The city's Parks and Recreation
Department is short-staffed, Fajack said, and he has been told that
Elysian Park is down about 16 maintenance workers.</TE>
<TE>   In some of the more trafficked areas, hillsides were covered with
blooming annual flowers, grass was green and trash was sparse. In
other places, the rich mix of plantings, including eucalyptus and
bougainvillea, was overgrown. Hiking trails were littered with used
condoms, discarded clothing, Chinese take-out containers and ice
cream wrappers.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a pretty amazing place," said Rob Moon of Eagle Rock, as
Fajack pointed through a locked gate to the site of a 1920s-era auto
park. "It's such a shame it's so uncared for."</TE>
<TE>   "I'd seen pictures in a book of the park taken in the 1950s," said
Carol Martin of La Canada Flintridge, who was also on the tour
Saturday. "It was still just beautiful then."</TE>
<TE>   Near the end of the tour, Fajack pointed down from a hill inside
Elysian Park to the nearby Cornfield yard, a 32-acre swath of cleared
land, once a railroad yard, that will be turned into a state park.
"We're hoping this part of the park will get more use when the
Cornfield yard gets developed," said Fajack, who sits on the state
advisory board that will make recommendations about how to transform
the site. Still, he added, "There's no money to maintain anything.
You add land, and the stuff gets stretched even thinner."</TE>

<HD>Taking the Danger Out of Walking to School</HD>
<DH>Safety: Assembly bill would double fines for speeders in
Ventura and Santa Barbara counties.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HOLLY J. WOLCOTT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In the three years since Citrus Glen Elementary School opened in east
Ventura, Principal Elke Fedde has worried each day whether her
students would arrive for classes safely.</LD>
<LD>   Dozens of the 550 students walk to the school tucked off Darling
Road or are dropped off on sidewalks lining the heavily traveled
neighborhood artery that helps drivers reach Telephone Road.</LD>
<LD>   The sight of speeding drivers, many of whom are parents, and the
sound of screeching tires have been common since the
kindergarten-through fifth-grade school opened in 1999, and now Fedde
must soon prepare for those moments again.</LD>
<TE>   "It was my greatest fear each day until classes started in the
morning and again when school let out in the afternoon," Fedde said.</TE>
<TE>   If Assemblywoman Hannah-Beth Jackson (D-Santa Barbara) has her
way, a new measure will be in place by January that she hopes will
reduce the number of children being hit by speeding cars.</TE>
<TE>   "We have a lot of pedestrian problems in Santa Barbara and Ventura
counties and I want to try and assure our children they will be
protected when they are walking to and from school," Jackson said.</TE>
<TE>   The School Zone Pedestrian Safety Bill, which has been approved by
the Assembly and awaits consideration by the Senate Appropriations
Committee, would launch a pilot program that could double fines for
all traffic violations in school zones in Ventura and Santa Barbara
counties.</TE>
<TE>   In practice, that means a driver traveling 35 mph in a 25 mph
school zone, for example, would be fined more than $200, according to
California Highway Patrol officials. The current fine is about $100.</TE>
<TE>   The additional revenue generated by the higher fine would be
placed in a general fund that city and school officials could use to
hire more crossing guards and create pedestrian safety programs.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't control the road and we don't control the teens driving
on the road but we endorsed the bill to try and get some money for
education to teach young drivers about safety," said Kathi Smith,
president of the Ojai Unified School District board.</TE>
<TE>   Smith said that pedestrian safety is a major issue in the city and
that board members are concerned about speeders in front of Nordhoff
High School, which sits beside busy California 33.</TE>
<TE>   "We just had an accident there this past year when one student was
driving and two students in the crosswalk were struck," Smith said.
While both victims recovered, Smith said highway drivers continue to
speed.</TE>
<TE>   Statistics from the CHP indicate that 93 children between the ages
of 5 and 18 were injured, and one was killed, while walking in
Ventura County last year.</TE>
<TE>   Oxnard was the third-most dangerous city in the state in 2001 for
pedestrians, according to a study released last week of California
cities with populations over 100,000. The city reported two
pedestrian fatalities and 101 injuries last year.</TE>
<TE>   But Oxnard police officials aren't certain that Jackson's bill is
the answer to the problem.</TE>
<TE>   "Speed limit signs are the most important thing, but I don't know
that a $200 fine versus a $100 fine is going to slow somebody down,"
Police Cmdr. Lee Wilcox said. "I don't know if it acts as a
deterrent."</TE>
<TE>   Oxnard police officials, like those throughout the county, work
with city engineers and school officials to analyze traffic data that
help determine where crossing guards are warranted.</TE>
<TE>   At Fedde's school in Ventura and many other elementary schools
across the county there is a paid crossing guard near the busiest
intersection. Also at Citrus Glen, parent volunteers monitor other
busy intersections.</TE>
<TE>   Not all schools--primarily because of funding, location and
traffic levels--are required to have crossing guards.</TE>
<TE>   Wilcox said his department would be open to studying Jackson's
bill and finding new ways to retain crossing guards, perhaps with
better pay. Most school districts pay the salaries of crossing guards
but look to police agencies to provide training.</TE>
<TE>   Jackson's bill is essentially a six-year pilot program that would
initially involve only Ventura and Santa Barbara counties.</TE>
<TE>   Under the bill, counties, cities or school districts could
voluntarily opt to participate in the program, Jackson said.</TE>
<TE>   Officials in both Ventura and Santa Barbara counties support the
measure, she added.</TE>
<TE>   Also behind the measure are parent-teacher organizations
throughout the state, including the 12th District PTA, which
represents all schools throughout Ventura County.</TE>
<TE>   "It's very interesting," said MaryAnn Downs of Thousand Oaks, a
spokeswoman for the 12th District PTA. "State funding for schools in
California is beneath the national average per pupil so something
like crossing guards would be considered an extra. Yet we're talking
about the safety of children."</TE>

<HD>When a Cop's in Trouble, the Word Gets Around</HD>
<DH>Colleagues, including a former partner he hadn't seen in
years, rally round an ailing Gardena detective.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEAN MERL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Ed Staniek has been retired from the Gardena Police Department for 25
years, now leading a quiet life in the Sacramento suburb of
Roseville.</LD>
<LD>   But, like a lot of career cops, he tries to keep in touch with the
people he once worked with. The close-knit department, he says, was
like family.</LD>
<LD>   So when he learned through an old friend in the detectives bureau
that his former partner, Det. Allan Otake, was, at age 49, in
desperate need of a liver transplant, Staniek wanted to join efforts
to help.</LD>
<TE>   He had been Otake's training officer when the young former reserve
cop joined up in 1974, and they were partners until disability forced
Staniek to retire in 1977. They hadn't seen each other in years, but
when Staniek contacted the gravely ill Otake earlier this year, "that
feeling of special commitment between partners just came rushing
back."</TE>
<TE>   In Gardena, fellow officers set about helping Otake fight a now
mostly resolved battle with the city over workers' compensation and
retirement benefits.</TE>
<TE>   Former cops, co-workers and other longtime friends began planning
fund-raising benefits to help Otake, a single father rearing two
sons. Hisham's Towing in Gardena, which works with the Police
Department, set up a trust fund and collected donations.</TE>
<TE>   Family members and friends, including Gardena Det. Torie Alvarez,
have tried to keep Otake's spirits up through an ordeal that began
more than two years ago, when the 28-year department veteran was
found to have liver disease.</TE>
<TE>   "It's been an uphill battle for him, and now what he really needs
is to get a liver. We're all feeling a little helpless, but we want
to try whatever we can," Alvarez said last week as time seemed to be
running out.</TE>
<TE>   Otake and his physicians believe he contracted liver-destroying
hepatitis C on the job, although Otake says he cannot single out a
specific incident among the many times he could have come in contact
with the blood of an infected person.</TE>
<TE>   Last year he developed liver cancer, and he has undergone
chemotherapy while awaiting a suitable liver donor.</TE>
<TE>   None of his relatives or close friends met all the
criteria--including having type O-positive blood and meeting health
and age requirements--that would have enabled one of them to donate a
section of liver.</TE>
<TE>   That put Otake on a waiting list--with about 18,000 other people
across the country in need of a liver--for a donated organ.</TE>
<TE>   Staniek recalls Otake as possessing all the best traits for police
work--intelligence, dedication, skill and experience--and a calm
demeanor.</TE>
<TE>   "He never lost his composure, even in the crisis situations, and I
always knew I could count on him," Staniek said.</TE>
<TE>   "I know he is trying to be calm and in control now, but he has got
to be feeling a lot of fear that he doesn't want to show, especially
to his boys."</TE>
<TE>   Staniek thought he could help by getting the word out about
Otake's plight. He wrote a poignant story and e-mailed it to police
organizations and newspapers around the state.</TE>
<TE>   The largest police officers association in the state promised to
publish it its monthly magazine; several newspapers did stories,
encouraging Staniek to keep up his publicity drive.</TE>
<TE>   And the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department recently began
airing Otake's story on its daily departmental broadcast.</TE>
<TE>   "Allan is not asking for special treatment, or to have his name
moved to the top of the list, but his family and friends are hoping
that anyone with a recently deceased next of kin might specify that
their liver be donated to him," the message to all local law
enforcement officers reads in part.</TE>
<TE>   Otake, who was born in Japan but grew up in Gardena, was stoic
about his circumstances and said last week he tries to keep his
spirits up for the sake of his sons, Joey, 15, and Tony, 13. He has
raised them alone since his marriage broke up when the boys were
small.</TE>
<TE>   "If it was just me alone in this world, it wouldn't be that big of
a deal for me to accept, but I want my boys to have their father,"
Otake said.</TE>
<TE>   As the boys grew, fishing trips replaced the "Mommy and Me"
classes Otake attended when they were younger.</TE>
<TE>   "We've always had a complete closeness," added Otake, a reserved
man who said he has been buoyed by the concern and offers of help
once he overcame his reluctance to tell others of his plight.</TE>
<TE>   "There's no way I begin to thank them for all they have done. And
my partner [Staniek], he really got the ball rolling in trying to
find a liver for me," Otake said.</TE>
<TE>   Late Thursday afternoon, Otake got the call he had been waiting
for--a donor had been found. Otake was to report right away for
surgery at St. Vincent's Hospital in Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   But a fuel-tanker crash had shut down the freeway, and the St.
Vincent's medical team members rushing to Harbor UCLA Medical Center
near Torrance to pick up the liver were stuck in traffic. They
flagged down a police patrol car for a quick escort.</TE>
<TE>   The department that saved the day? Gardena.</TE>

<HD>Heston Faces His Illness Squarely</HD>
<DH>Ailing: Touched by good wishes, he looks ahead to roles,
despite Alzheimer's symptoms.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBERT W. WELKOS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"The world is a tough place," Charlton Heston says with a chuckle.
"You're never going to get out of it alive."</LD>
<LD>   It is one of those gray, misty mornings that masquerades as a
change in the weather in Southern California, and the Oscar-winning
actor, known the world over for his larger-than-life roles in movies
such as "The Ten Commandments" and "Ben-Hur" is seated outside, by
his backyard pool in Coldwater Canyon. He is sitting down for his
first interview since announcing in a videotape that doctors have
told him he has symptoms similar to those of Alzheimer's disease.</LD>
<LD>   He appears rather frail and walks at a slower pace. The booming
baritone that is so familiar on the big screen in characters from
Michelangelo in "The Agony and the Ecstasy" to "El Cid" is replaced
by a soft conversational tone.</LD>
<TE>   But as he speaks Friday, the 77-year-old movie veteran is
quick-witted and delivers vivid recollections of his early years in
Hollywood as he looks ahead, he hopes, to years of acting before the
curtain finally comes down on his acting career.</TE>
<TE>   "I feel the way I have been always feeling," Heston says. "Now, I
understand the chances are very slim that they will remain that way."</TE>
<TE>   More than a movie star, Heston has been a lightning rod in
political causes fueled by his unswerving support of gun ownership,
which has propelled him into the national arena as president of the
National Rifle Assn.</TE>
<TE>   The announcement about his health triggered an outpouring of
concern from President Bush to Sarah Brady, chairwoman of the Brady
Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence. Her statement that her group's
thoughts were with Heston and his family at a difficult time moved
the actor.</TE>
<TE>   Less than 30 minutes after the news broke, former First Lady Nancy
Reagan, whose husband, former President Ronald Reagan, has
Alzheimer's, was on the phone to Heston and his wife, Lydia, giving
them her private phone number and telling Lydia Heston she's there if
she's needed.</TE>
<TE>   Before a routine physical more than two weeks ago, Heston says, he
had no idea that he might be given such a sobering diagnosis.</TE>
<TE>   His grown son--producer, director and writer Fraser Heston, who
sits with his father during the interview--notes that "to be honest,
I noticed a certain amount of forgetfulness," but he thought it was
not unlike the memory lapses suffered by other people of the actor's
age.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   'I Don't Have It Now'</TE>
<TE>   Alzheimer's is a degenerative disease of the brain that affects
roughly 4 million Americans, most of them older than 70. Its symptoms
include memory loss, disorientation, impaired judgment and
personality changes. In its final stages, it results in a coma and
death.</TE>
<TE>   What his doctors said, Heston says, is that his symptoms "can be
consistent with Alzheimer's."</TE>
<TE>   "That was the way they put it," the actor notes. " ... I can say
for certain that I don't have it now."</TE>
<TE>   But Fraser Heston, 47, quickly interrupts his father.</TE>
<TE>   "Well, I wouldn't say that is correct, Chuck. That is not quite
what they told you. They are as certain as they are going to be. We
are certainly talking to various physicians, and he'll continue to be
treated and tested. That's about all the diagnosis that you get."</TE>
<TE>   Heston won't talk about the precise course of treatment his
doctors are recommending. But he notes that he and his wife work out
daily with a personal trainer, John Lafleur, in their home. In fact,
while Heston is being interviewed, Lydia Heston is going through
stretching exercises in the living room under Lafleur's supervision.</TE>
<TE>   Heston and his wife have lived in the house near Mulholland Drive
for more than four decades.</TE>
<TE>   The post-modern style home was designed and built by the actor's
father after Heston won the Academy Award for best actor in 1959's
"Ben-Hur." On a table in the backyard is a small statue of a Roman
riding furiously in a chariot, similar to the one used in Heston's
gritty movie role.</TE>
<TE>   Heston says he chose to make public his private medical condition
because he feared that it would leak out eventually, and then it
could appear that he was hiding something. Alzheimer's, he stresses,
is nothing to be ashamed of.</TE>
<TE>   "It seemed the appropriate thing to do," the actor says.</TE>
<TE>   "We all sat down and talked about this," adds his son. "It was a
big decision. I felt from the beginning that the best thing to do
would be to make an announcement right away, tell exactly what we
were doing and to let the public know because, inevitably, word gets
out."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Words of the Bard</TE>
<TE>   Heston's dramatic announcement, in which he appeared on screen
before reporters in a tight head shot with a stark background, was a
poignant and moving address to his fans.</TE>
<TE>   At the end of the statement, he quoted lines from William
Shakespeare's "The Tempest," lines that he knew from memory.</TE>
<TE>   "Be cheerful, sir.</TE>
<TE>   Our revels now are ended. These our actors,</TE>
<TE>   As I foretold you, were all spirits and</TE>
<TE>   Are melted into air, into thin air:</TE>
<TE>   And, like the baseless fabric of this vision,</TE>
<TE>   The cloud-capp'd towers, the gorgeous palaces,</TE>
<TE>   The solemn temples, the great globe itself,</TE>
<TE>   Yea all which it inherit, shall dissolve</TE>
<TE>   And, like this insubstantial pageant faded,</TE>
<TE>   Leave not a rack behind. We are such stuff</TE>
<TE>   As dreams are made on, and our little life</TE>
<TE>   Is rounded with a sleep."</TE>
<TE>   Heston says he has been overwhelmed by the outpouring of concern
and good wishes from around the world since his Aug. 10 announcement.</TE>
<TE>   Recalling Nancy Reagan's phone call, he says: "She talked to Lydia
and to me, and it was really a nice thing for her to have done. She
didn't really need to do that. After all, she's the president's wife.
But she did.</TE>
<TE>   "We knew her [years ago] in New York. We go back a long way. But
still, it was a most generous gesture on her part. I wrote her a
letter and thanked her, after talking to her on the phone."</TE>
<TE>   Then, last week, Heston received a brief call from President Bush,
who had arrived at his Texas ranch for a vacation.</TE>
<TE>   "He wished me well and was proud of what I had done for my
country," the actor recalls. "Which is, perhaps, overstating it a
little."</TE>
<TE>   "He didn't ask you to be the next vice president, did he?" Fraser
jokes.</TE>
<TE>   "I was hoping for that," Heston replies with a broad grin. "Funny
you should ask!"</TE>
<TE>   Reflecting on Bush's call, he adds in a sober tone, "That meant a
great deal. If the president calls you, why, that's a good thing."</TE>
<TE>   Heston then laughs about a letter he received from a friend who is
not in show business. "He said, 'Boy, what a deal. For the first time
in my life'--how did he put it?--'the only big shot who remembers my
name now says he may forget it.' It's a great line. I've been using
it every day."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   On Campaign Trail</TE>
<TE>   Heston says he has no plans to leave the political arena. As
president of the National Rifle Assn. since 1998, he says, he plans
to hit the campaign trail this fall on behalf of candidates, both
Republican and Democrat, with similar beliefs.</TE>
<TE>   The fact that Heston is a longtime gun enthusiast has taken on
special meaning because of the Alzheimer's issue. After his
announcement, news articles appeared, asking whether he might be
forced to give up his guns.</TE>
<TE>   Heston says they are locked up in his house. "I no longer hunt,"
he says. "Guns in any house should be locked up." And his son says
that, as time goes by, he will evaluate the situation as necessary.</TE>
<TE>   Throughout the interview, which stretches nearly an hour, Heston
never stumbles over his words, gets lost in thought or struggles with
his memory.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, he recalls colorful stories from his past, like the time
the emperor of Japan came out of his palace to view "Ben-Hur" at a
special screening and the film broke in the projection booth, or how
legendary director Cecil B. DeMille chose Heston's son to be baby
Moses in "The Ten Commandments."</TE>
<TE>   At the hospital, he recalls, there was a telegram for Fraser from
DeMille saying: "Congratulations, you've got the part."</TE>
<TE>   Looking ahead, Heston says, he does not think he is in a race to
complete projects before Alzheimer's takes hold. He has a movie
project this fall, but is reluctant to give details about it.</TE>
<TE>   (For now, he is enthusiastic about an animated version of
"Ben-Hur," with his son as an executive producer. The film was
directed and produced by William R. Kowalchuk, with collaboration
from producer John Stronach. The movie will come out next spring,
with Heston delivering an introduction, narrating the story and
providing the voice of the title role.</TE>
<TE>   Why make an animated version of the classic Lew Wallace novel,
especially when the 1959 feature movie, directed by William Wyler,
won 11 Oscars, including best film?</TE>
<TE>   "Because no one has ever done it," Heston replies. "Animated
movies are vastly popular everywhere, and to take a significant film
like 'Ben-Hur' and do it as an animated version is something I think
not many people do."</TE>
<TE>   Heston says his faith is carrying him through a difficult time. "I
go to church. I don't go as often as I should. But I believe in God,
and I think the things that have happened to me would not have
happened without his consent."</TE>
<TE>   He managed to get through World War II in one piece, serving in
the Army Air Corps, he notes, when a lot of young men didn't come
back.</TE>
<TE>   "You've got to think--one might dare to think--God wanted me to
get through the war or make 'Ben-Hur' in the first place, or make
'The Ten Commandments' or to give me children that I am proud of more
deeply than I can say. And my grandchildren. They mean a great deal
to me. My wife--I couldn't imagine being married to anyone else."</TE>
<TE>   Asked what he meant when he said in his announcement that he was
facing the future with courage and surrender, he replies: "Sooner or
later, the man with the scythe comes along and says, 'It's time.' "</TE>
<TE>   Heston says that, when that time comes, he would like to say, "OK.
I had a great run."</TE>

<HD>Home Sales Frenzy Eases</HD>
<DH>Ventura County: July prices dip from June. But properties
continue to sell fast, helped by low interest rates.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DARYL KELLEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Ventura County's housing market remained strong in July, but real
estate agents say the bidding wars of a few weeks ago have abated as
rising prices make buyers more cautious.</LD>
<LD>   "It's not as much of a frenzy," said Karen Campbell, president of
the Ventura County Coastal Assn. of Realtors, which represents agents
in six west county cities. "Fewer people are looking at each house,
and we're not seeing as many multiple offers as we did. Realtors feel
the market is changing."</LD>
<LD>   Still, it remained hot in July, hovering near an all-time high for
the month. Prices did dip slightly, but the $331,000 price for a
typical house was still 20% higher than a year ago.</LD>
<TE>   Analyst John Karevoll said the $4,000 price decline last month is
an aberration that occurs nearly every July as the number of new
houses sold declines after a June push by builders to increase sales
at the close of the quarter.</TE>
<TE>   Just 174 new homes sold last month, compared with 204 in June. On
average, new houses cost about $100,000 more than an existing home
when it is resold, so a decline in new home sales pushes down the
county's median price overall.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't put much importance in the price decline," said Karevoll
of DataQuick Information Services, which tracks completed sales.
"Sales and prices are still strong. Analysts kept telling us this
market was going to go off a cliff, but I haven't seen it."</TE>
<TE>   Sales of houses and condos totaled 1,621 last month, up 63 from
the month before and 45 higher than the previous July. That
represented the second strongest performance for a July in 14 years.</TE>
<TE>   After last month's slight drop, Ventura County's median home
price--where half of sales are higher and half lower--was up $56,000
from July 2001 and $145,000 higher than in 1995 at the bottom of the
real estate market.</TE>
<TE>   If Campbell sees a stabilizing of the market in the west county,
Peter Greer, president elect of the Conejo Valley Assn. of Realtors,
says the boom of 2002 is powering right through the summer.</TE>
<TE>   "Usually interest starts waning toward the end of summer, but
interest is growing," Greer said. "People are still out there buying,
and we're getting an awful lot of inquiries now from investors, who
will push up the lower-priced end of the market."</TE>
<TE>   Sales of homes and condos under $300,000 are already almost
immediate, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Greer said he does see some reluctance by buyers of houses selling
for $350,000 to $450,000.</TE>
<TE>   "There just doesn't seem to be the interest there," he said. "Then
it picks up again over $500,000."</TE>
<TE>   The reason is, he said, that many of the moderate-priced homes are
older and in standard condition. People are reluctant to stretch
their budget for such a home, while they may stretch their budget for
a nicer, more expensive new home.</TE>
<TE>   "There's isn't that big difference in price in some of these
homes, yet look at the homes and there's a big difference," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The market remains strong countywide, with only Port Hueneme
registering a decline in sales and price compared with July 2001.</TE>
<TE>   Sellers in the Lake Sherwood and Westlake areas saw the sales
price of a typical house increase $150,500 to $538,000 in 12 months.
In Oak Park, sales and prices were relatively flat. Simi Valley's
price growth was below the county norm. But Moorpark had a sharp
increase in sales and a tidy 24% increase in prices.</TE>
<TE>   Central Ventura continued a huge run-up in sales price, from
$252,000 12 months ago to $340,000 today. And Ojai experienced a 56%
increase in sales compared with last July and saw its typical price
rise more than $90,000 to $392,000.</TE>
<TE>   Agents say the continued decline of mortgage interest rates will
only fuel the boom. Fixed home loan rates reached 30-year lows or
hovered near them last week.</TE>
<TE>   For Southern California, average rates for fixed-rate, 30-year
loans were 6.22% with a one-point fee last week, and 5.68% for a
15-year loan, said Earl Peattie, vice president of National Financial
News Services.</TE>

<LD>Jacqueline H. Nguyen could not have predicted her future on the day
in 1975 when she and her family huddled inside a U.S. military
helicopter as they escaped war-torn Saigon.</LD>
<LD>   Later, in the United States, her parents worked around the clock
to save enough money to open a doughnut shop in North Hollywood.
Nguyen studied between customers, won a full academic scholarship to
college and went to law school, though she had never met an attorney.</LD>
<LD>   The 37-year-old federal prosecutor was appointed Tuesday to the
Los Angeles County Superior Court, where she will become the first
Vietnamese American woman to serve on the California bench.</LD>
<TE>   She will be joined by another Asian American immigrant, Tammy
Chung Ryu, 41, whose judicial appointment on Friday will make her the
first female Korean American state judge in California.</TE>
<TE>   Both women immigrated to California as children, helped their
parents run small family businesses, attended the same law school and
became respected attorneys. Their appointments by Gov. Gray Davis
represent the changing ethnic and gender composition of the
California judiciary.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm proud that these well-qualified individuals also reflect the
great diversity of California," Davis said last week.</TE>
<TE>   Since taking office in 1998, Davis has appointed a higher
percentage of women and minority group members to the bench than any
previous governor, according to a statistical analysis prepared by
his office.</TE>
<TE>   Of his 222 judicial appointments, 34% are women, 13% Latinos, 10%
African American and 7% Asian American, the statistics show.</TE>
<TE>   Nguyen's parents arrived at Camp Pendleton with six children
younger than 11, no job prospects and $5 in their pockets. Her mother
did not speak English.</TE>
<TE>   Their first home was a tent they shared with two other Vietnamese
families on the military base.</TE>
<TE>   The Nguyens later settled in Montrose, where young Jacqueline
excelled in school and helped her mother at night cleaning dental
offices. Her father, who had been a major in the South Vietnamese
Army, worked an overnight shift at a bank and also pumped gas to feed
his family.</TE>
<TE>   Despite their hardships, Nguyen speaks of the many opportunities
afforded her in the United States. She said she cannot picture what
her life might have been like, had her family remained in
Vietnam--except that her father probably would have been imprisoned
or executed when the war ended.</TE>
<TE>   After graduating from Occidental College and UCLA Law School,
Nguyen was a litigation associate at the Los Angeles law firm of
Musick, Peeler &amp; Garrett. She joined the U.S. attorney's office in
1995 and is now deputy chief of the general crimes section.</TE>
<TE>   Until this spring, when her mother sold the doughnut shop, Nguyen
could be found on weekends behind the counter, helping out at
Foster's Donuts, at Victory Boulevard and Vineland Avenue.</TE>
<TE>   "That really grounded me in reality," she said. "I have gone so
far and yet at the same time I have a very constant reminder of how
much she really sacrificed and really where I came from to get to
this point in my life."</TE>
<TE>   Nguyen, her husband, Pio Kim, also a federal prosecutor, and their
3-year-old son live in Studio City.</TE>
<TE>   Like Nguyen, Ryu left her homeland at age 9 and settled with her
family in the United States. Her parents owned a small west Oakland
grocery store that Ryu managed while in school.</TE>
<TE>   Ryu graduated from UC Berkeley and UCLA Law School, then joined
the state attorney general's office in Los Angeles, where she is a
supervisor in the health, education and welfare section.</TE>
<TE>   After the 1992 Los Angeles riots, Ryu said, "The Korean American
community felt helpless. They realized we needed to gain some
influence."</TE>
<TE>   Over the next decade, older Korean Americans encouraged the next
generation to run for elective office and become more involved in the
larger community. "One of the reasons I applied [for a judgeship] was
because we lack people on the bench," Ryu said.</TE>
<TE>   Ryu and her husband, James Ryu, who publishes a Korean American
magazine, have two children, 6 and 11, and live in Lomita.</TE>
<TE>   In their early years, both women say they looked to other Asian
American attorneys to provide role models because few, if any,
existed within their own immigrant communities.</TE>
<TE>   In law school, Nguyen interned at the Asian Pacific American Legal
Center of Southern California and helped immigrants. She recalls the
immigrants, all recently arrived, being "enormously appreciative" of
what little help she could offer them. "It reminded me of how lost we
were," she said.</TE>
<TE>   As an undergraduate, Ryu assisted the attorneys who secured
reparations for Japanese Americans interned during World War II.</TE>
<TE>   Through that experience, she said, "I realized that attorneys can
practically change history."</TE>
<TE>   Now, she and Nguyen are writing their own chapters and leading the
way for other Asian American women pursuing legal careers. Century
City attorney Deana Chuang, 29, co-chairwoman of the Asian Pacific
American Women Lawyers Alliance, was thrilled with Davis's latest
judicial appointments.</TE>
<TE>   "It's nice to have one of your own make it," Chuang said. "It
expands the possibilities of what I see for myself."</TE>

<KH>FATHER THEODORE LLANOS</KH>
<HD>4 Cases Provide a Glimpse of How Archdiocese Responded</HD>
<DH>38 Abuse Counts Dropped Due to Time Elapsed</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>On Sept. 16, 1994, Scott Griffith, then a 21-year-old college
student, reported to the Los Angeles Archdiocese that Father Theodore
Llanos had molested him for four years, beginning when he was a
seventh-grader.</LD>
<LD>   The archdiocese dispatched Monsignor Timothy J. Dyer to assure
Griffith's parents that the sexual abuse of their son had been an
"isolated" incident, the first accusation in Llanos' career of 22
years.</LD>
<LD>   Dyer also informed the Griffiths that he intended to announce
Llanos' removal from St. Barnabas Church in Long Beach as an
"administrative" move--something the Griffiths objected to as a
cover-up.</LD>
<TE>   Within days, Llanos was sent for evaluation and treatment to St.
Luke's Institute in Maryland, where he reportedly admitted molesting 10
victims.</TE>
<TE>   Dyer wrote to the Griffiths on Sept. 22: "At this point, I do not
feel it is the role of the archdiocese to present Father Llanos to
the district attorney. My own thinking is based on my experience that
incarceration of the priest neither rehabilitates him nor enhances
the treatment which would be offered your son and your family."</TE>
<TE>   Dyer said the Griffiths were free to go to the police. But
during a meeting, according to the victim's father, Dyer discouraged
them from doing so.</TE>
<TE>   "I was told the police could be very tactless in their approach to
our son, and it would be very embarrassing for him," Paul Griffith
said.</TE>
<TE>   In mid-November, Long Beach Dets. Randi Castillo and Michael
Holguin drove to archdiocesan headquarters, looking for information
about allegations that Llanos had molested children.</TE>
<TE>   Castillo said the receptionist there refused to let them talk to
anyone, because they didn't have an appointment. The detectives said
they encountered the same treatment while visiting parishes where
Llanos had served in Covina, Bellflower and Long Beach.</TE>
<TE>   "Talking to employees, including priests and retired priests, many
of them mentioned that they were informed that they should not talk
to us, that it came from downtown," Holguin said.</TE>
<TE>   The detectives then spoke with Sister Judith Ann Murphy, the
archdiocese attorney.</TE>
<TE>   "She told me only one person had come forward, and [they were]
reaching out through pastoral counseling to this victim," Castillo
said. When Castillo inquired about the list of 10 altar servers whom
Llanos reportedly had admitted molesting, she said, Murphy replied:
"You'll have to get a court order for that."</TE>
<TE>   Murphy declined to be interviewed for this story, saying through
an archdiocese spokesman that she never talks to reporters.</TE>
<TE>   Attorney John P. McNicholas, who represented the archdiocese in
the Llanos case, said that victims were always urged to contact
police and that the archdiocese stood ready to turn over the priest's
files if authorities obtained a court order. A subpoena was prepared
for Llanos' file, but a judge threw it out on the basis of objections
from the priest's attorney, Donald Steier.</TE>
<TE>   Llanos was charged with 38 counts of sexual abuse of minors
in 1995. The charges were dismissed in February 1996 by a judge, who
ruled that the statute of limitations had expired.</TE>
<TE>   In January 1997, Llanos committed suicide.</TE>
<TE>   Because several Llanos victims and their families filed a lawsuit,
the archdiocese cut off payments in 1996 to counselors who were
providing psychiatric treatment to them.</TE>
<TE>   Cardinal Roger M. Mahony said he was unaware that counseling
services had been severed until The Times recently asked him about
it.</TE>
<TE>   "I was appalled. Appalled!" Mahony said. "I had never heard of it
in my life." The cardinal said he immediately ordered that any future
legal action against the archdiocese have no bearing on payment for
treatment of people who had been sexually exploited by priests.</TE>
<TE>   Mahony also said that, before he was recently informed by The
Times, he had no knowledge that police officers had reported meeting
resistance from archdiocesan officials.</TE>
<TE>   "We were far from covering up. Far from it," he said. "We were
trying to find out where the victims were."</TE>

<HD>Archdiocese for Years Kept Claims of Abuse From Police</HD>
<DH>Church also let accused priests flee, say documents,
interviews. But Mahony has been relatively aggressive in dismissing
clergy.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GLENN F. BUNTING, RALPH FRAMMOLINO and RICHARD WINTON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Faced with allegations that parish priests had sexually abused
minors, the Los Angeles Archdiocese under Cardinal Roger M. Mahony
for many years withheld information from police and allowed clerics
facing prosecution to flee to foreign countries, internal records and
interviews show.</LD>
<LD>   At the same time, Mahony has been more aggressive than many U.S.
bishops in dismissing members of the clergy. According to newly
obtained information, the cardinal quietly removed 17 priests from
ministry during the last decade who had either admitted or had been
credibly accused of molesting minors.</LD>
<LD>   In recent months, as the Roman Catholic Church has struggled to
contain the clergy sex abuse scandal, Mahony has taken a stance as an
outspoken reformer on a mission to oust all sex offenders from the
priesthood.</LD>
<TE>   But an examination of sexual abuse cases during his tenure in Los
Angeles since 1985 shows that the archdiocese also worked to keep a
growing problem from the eyes of the public and the hands of the law.
The Times examination found:</TE>
<TE>   * Five parish priests fled the country and one disappeared after
learning of complaints that they had sexually abused underage
victims. Two of the clergymen left after a top aide to Mahony
informed them of allegations, and a third was told to join the
priesthood in the Philippines. Of the six, two are fugitives.</TE>
<TE>   * Police complained in two cases that church officials had
hampered criminal investigations by refusing to cooperate. In one
inquiry, Long Beach police say, they were turned away from
archdiocese headquarters when they asked for help. "The door was shut
in our face," said Long Beach Det. Randi Castillo, a 26-year veteran
who led an investigation in the mid-1990s of a popular pastor who
allegedly had molested at least 10 altar boys. "This was absolutely
something I had never encountered in all my years in law
enforcement."</TE>
<TE>   * Two convicted sex offenders were allowed to continue serving as
priests for years before Mahony dismissed them in February in
response to the growing furor over clergy sex abuse. Both priests
resided at parishes within walking distance of Catholic elementary
schools, where administrators and parents were not informed of their
criminal backgrounds.</TE>
<TE>   * The archdiocese has agreed to four out-of-court settlements
totaling $9.2 million since 2000. The archdiocese's share of the cost
was $3.7 million. The agreements included confidentiality clauses to
keep the sexual abuses secret.</TE>
<TE>   * The archdiocese routinely failed to report errant priests to
authorities until 1997, when a new California law compelled clergy to
disclose all allegations of sexual abuse of minors. Before the
legislation was passed, a top aide to Mahony discouraged at least
three alleged victims from going to police.</TE>
<TE>   Now, Mahony and the archdiocese are bracing for possible
indictments of 15 current and former priests on felony sex charges,
according to law enforcement sources. In addition, the archdiocese is
facing a class-action suit, filed last month, seeking millions of
dollars.</TE>
<TE>   In a series of interviews, Mahony said the archdiocese has worked
closely with law enforcement on a wide range of issues over the years
and that authorities have long known about nearly all of the sexual
abuse cases involving priests in the Los Angeles Archdiocese. The
allegations were often reported to police, Mahony said, by
therapists, teachers and victims themselves.</TE>
<TE>   "There was no sort of policy on my part that we would not
cooperate with law enforcement," the cardinal said. Because reporting
was not mandated until 1997, "this was not an area of responsibility
for the church. We always made sure that people knew that they
themselves were the ones who should make the report or should contact
police. We also have cases, if I might say so, where the police
didn't do much about it either."</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles County Dist. Atty. Steve Cooley called Mahony's
characterization "disingenuous."</TE>
<TE>   "The historic culture of the archdiocese in cooperating with local
law enforcement has been inadequate and flawed," Cooley said.
"Morally, the archdiocese should have been the first to step forward
on behalf of victims and actively cooperate with law enforcement
regarding known instances of clerical sexual abuse."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   34 Alleged Abusers Have Been Identified</TE>
<TE>   Based on a review of internal archdiocese records, police reports
and lawsuits, The Times identified 33 parish priests and one deacon
who, since Mahony's arrival in 1985, have been accused of molesting
minors. Seven of the clerics were dismissed by the cardinal in
February after clergy sex abuse drew increased attention as a
national scandal. Six fled, three have been convicted of sex crimes
and 17 are under criminal investigation by law enforcement officials.
One priest committed suicide after charges of sexual abuse were
dismissed. The Times examination also included more than 100
interviews with church officials, law enforcement authorities,
alleged victims and their attorneys.</TE>
<TE>   Mahony, 66, sat down three times in recent weeks for a total of
nearly five hours to discuss his actions in the clergy sex crisis as
leader of 5 million Catholics in the nation's largest archdiocese.
Two lawyers and Mahony's spokesman were also present. Partners from
Sitrick &amp; Co., the public relations firm recently hired to assist the
archdiocese, also provided information for this article.</TE>
<TE>   As archbishop, Mahony oversees about 1,100 priests and 287
parishes in Los Angeles, Ventura and Santa Barbara counties. The
cardinal said he hopes to put the scandal behind the archdiocese and
is eagerly awaiting next month's opening of the $200-million
Cathedral of Our Lady of the Angels in downtown Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   "I want the truth out. I want this thing dealt with," Mahony said.
"But I also want people to know we haven't been just sitting around,
either, for 15 years. We've learned a lot the hard way.... What I'm
trying to do is learn from all of my mistakes and try to make sure
this never happens again."</TE>
<TE>   Mahony said the handling of molester priests has evolved over the
years as church leaders acquired a greater understanding of how to
deal with the problem. He said that all priests in the archdiocese
found to have molested minors during the last decade were either
dismissed or suspended from their ministerial duties. His staff now
takes immediate action, including informing law enforcement, when it
learns of sexual abuse allegations, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "Looking back at it, sure, knowing what we know today, we
would have picked up the phone and called [police] on every single case
that ever came along, just to double-check," Mahony said. "We didn't
do that, but [we weren't] trying to hide anything."</TE>
<TE>   The cardinal has refused to disclose the names of priests he
removed from ministry, citing privacy concerns. Of the 17 who were
dismissed over the past decade, only one was kicked out of the
priesthood, and another has applied to be laicized, a formal
termination process that requires the pope's approval. In all of the
cases, Mahony took away the priests' authority to wear clerical garb
and administer the sacraments, including the right to say Mass in
public or hear confession, archdiocese officials said. Most of the
priests are living on their own or with family members; some continue
to receive monthly stipends and other benefits, the officials added.</TE>
<TE>   When asked about his involvement in responding to specific cases
of sexual misconduct, Mahony said he was often uninformed and
preoccupied with other issues. In the interviews, he said he had been
stunned to learn of a number of critical decisions by top aides who
reported directly to him.</TE>
<TE>   For example, Mahony said he had no knowledge of complaints by Long
Beach detectives that the archdiocese had blocked police efforts in
1994 and 1995 to investigate reports that Father Theodore Llanos had
sodomized young altar boys. The cardinal said he did not learn of the
concerns until The Times recently submitted questions in writing to
him.</TE>
<TE>   "I was appalled, to be honest with you," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Yet the police complaints were familiar to Mahony's advisors and
parishioners in communities where Llanos served. They were reported
in the Long Beach Press-Telegram and prompted a Dec. 7, 1994,
three-page letter to the newspaper by Father Gregory Coiro, Mahony's
spokesman at the time. Coiro wrote that the archdiocese had launched
its own investigation, offered counseling to victims and advised them
to report accusations to police.</TE>
<TE>   The archdiocese for years elected not to report allegations of
sexual abuse against priests because victims frequently were
reluctant to go to police, Mahony said. Lawyers for the archdiocese
also took the position that members of the clergy were not required
by law to disclose accusations by adults who came forward to report
sexual abuse that had occurred when they were minors. These people,
the lawyers said, had been informed that they could report
allegations to police on their own.</TE>
<TE>   That practice changed earlier this year as the clergy sex scandal
boiled over. Mahony said he ordered his top aides to turn over to
police the names of all priests suspected earlier of engaging in sex
crimes.</TE>
<TE>   In one of a series of confidential e-mails leaked to the media,
Mahony wrote on March 27: "If we don't, today, 'consult' with the
[LAPD] about those three names, I can guarantee you that I will get
hauled into a grand jury proceeding, and I will be forced to give all
the names, etc.... If we don't take immediate, aggressive action
here--the consequences for the [archdiocese] are going to be
incredible: charges of cover-up, concealing criminals, etc., etc."</TE>
<TE>   Dioceses throughout the country have received no specific
guidelines from the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops on what kinds
of information should be reported to authorities.</TE>
<TE>   "We just assumed that, if it was a question of a crime, the stance
of the church was not to back away or cover up, but to cooperate,"
said Bishop John F. Kinney, of St. Cloud, Minn., chairman of an ad
hoc committee on sexual abuse from 1993 to 2000. Mahony also served
on the panel.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Some Priests Flee Abroad</TE>
<TE>   Since Mahony became archbishop, at least five priests who faced
accusations of sexually abusing minors have fled to foreign
countries.</TE>
<TE>   One of the fugitives, Father Tilak Jayawardene, allegedly molested
a 17-year-old boy on four occasions, beginning in October 1990, at
the rectory of Incarnation Church in Glendale. The teenager, who
planned to enroll in a Catholic seminary, reported the alleged abuse
about a month later to a teacher. He also met with then-Msgr. Thomas
J. Curry, the vicar for clergy from 1986 to 1990 who supervised all
priests in the archdiocese and reported directly to Mahony.</TE>
<TE>   On Dec. 4, 1990, Curry informed Jayawardene of the allegation,
told him he was no longer welcome in the archdiocese and urged him to
go home to Sri Lanka, law enforcement and archdiocese sources said.</TE>
<TE>   "I do understand that you will be returning as soon as possible to
Sri Lanka, and I wish you well for the future," Curry wrote
Jayawardene the next day on archdiocese stationery.</TE>
<TE>   An attorney for the archdiocese, J. Michael Hennigan, said
authorities were not notified because the teenager "emphasized very
strongly that he did not want either the police or his mother told."</TE>
<TE>   Said Glendale Police Sgt. Kim Lardie: "That the church would have
him leave before contacting the Police Department ... greatly upsets
us."</TE>
<TE>   On Dec. 13--several days after Jayawardene departed--the teenager
walked into the Glendale police station and reported the alleged
crime, Lardie said. Prosecutors are still trying to extradite
Jayawardene, 58, who was charged in 1991 with six counts of
committing oral copulation on a minor.</TE>
<TE>   Mahony said he had no involvement in urging Jayawardene to
leave. "I wasn't, to my recollection, consulted or knew anything about
it," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Curry, whom Mahony has since promoted to bishop of Santa Barbara,
referred questions to his attorney, Brian Hennigan, a former federal
prosecutor who specializes in white-collar criminal defense work at
the law firm of Irell &amp; Manella and is not related to J. Michael
Hennigan. Although he declined to discuss specific cases, Brian
Hennigan insisted that Curry had never acted on sensitive matters
involving priests without Mahony's input.</TE>
<TE>   "Decisions were not made in the dark, and there weren't things
that Cardinal Mahony found out about after the fact," Brian Hennigan
said. "There was an ongoing dialogue when problems arose."</TE>
<TE>   Curry also played a key role in the handling of other priests who
disappeared while facing accusations of sexual abuse, documents show.</TE>
<TE>   In 1988, he met with Father Nicolas Aguilar Rivera regarding
allegations that the priest had molested altar boys in two parishes.
During the meeting, Aguilar told Curry that he planned to leave the
country soon, according to archdiocese sources. By the time a school
principal reported the case to police two days later, Aguilar had
fled to Mexico City. Aguilar, 60, was subsequently charged with 19
felony counts of committing lewd acts on a child and is still being
sought by U.S. authorities.</TE>
<TE>   Curry also sent letters urging Father Santiago Tamayo to stay in
the Philippines after he fled rather than face allegations of having
had sex with an underage girl. In a lawsuit, the girl accused Tamayo
of inducing her to have sex with six other priests in a period of
four years, until 1982, when she became pregnant.</TE>
<TE>   "It is not advisable that you return at all to the United States,"
Curry wrote Tamayo on Dec. 28, 1987. Lawsuits "can only open old
wounds and further hurt anyone concerned, including the archdiocese."</TE>
<TE>   Curry wrote again on Aug. 26, 1988: "I was surprised to learn ...
that you are in the Los Angeles area. I am requesting that you return
to the Philippines promptly."</TE>
<TE>   The letter, which was copied to Mahony, also explained that the
archdiocese would continue to provide a monthly stipend to Tamayo.
The priest returned to Los Angeles in 1991 to issue a public apology
to his victim. He died in 1996.</TE>
<TE>   Curry, in a brief interview in Santa Barbara before he retained an
attorney, said: "I don't know that I was asking him to hide out. I'm
telling him that it wasn't a good thing for him to be here, given all
the damage that he had caused."</TE>
<TE>   Mahony said he "never became informed about the Tamayo case fully.
In fact, I still don't know much about it. All I know is, we
don't want anyone coming to this archdiocese who's got a problem. We
want 'em out of here."</TE>
<TE>   The cardinal said he has no authority over a parish priest
visiting from another country or religious order, such as Jayawardene
and Aguilar, once the cleric is removed from service in the
archdiocese. "All he has to do is get in a taxi and head right for
LAX, and he's out of here," Mahony said. "That's part of the
difficulty with those guys, and makes it very difficult for us to
manage them."</TE>
<TE>   Mahony has written numerous letters to Rome and bishops in foreign
countries, raising concerns about the status of priests who fled. He
said the archdiocese now cooperates with authorities to confiscate
the passport of any visiting priest suspected of sexual abuse.</TE>
<TE>   Yet two parish priests convicted of sex crimes in the 1980s were
allowed to continue serving in the ministry for more than a decade.
Parishioners and parents were not told about the criminal histories
of Father John Wishard and Father Gerald B. Fessard, according to
interviews and archdiocese officials.</TE>
<TE>   "Back then, it was the feeling of the archdiocese that the
convictions were simply one more factor in the whole process," said
one archdiocese source.</TE>
<TE>   Fessard, 56, pleaded no contest in 1987 to separate counts of
soliciting lewd acts in a public place and battery on a minor. He
received three years' probation. Archdiocese records show that, after
his conviction, Fessard resided from 1991 to 1994 at St. Luke Church
in Temple City, adjacent to a Catholic elementary school.</TE>
<TE>   Wishard was charged in 1980 with oral copulation on a minor,
pleaded no contest and was sentenced to five years' probation. He was
ordered to get psychiatric treatment and prohibited from being in the
presence of minors without a supervising adult. A judge terminated
Wishard's probation in 1982, the felony was reduced to a misdemeanor
in 1991 and it was later dismissed. He was assigned to parishes with
elementary schools nearby in 1987-89 at St. Genevieve in Panorama
City and in 1993-97 at St. Mary of the Assumption in Santa Maria,
according to archdiocese records.</TE>
<TE>   St. Mary's principal, Carmen Vadillo, said she had been shocked to
learn that Wishard had been arrested for sexual abuse. ''I'm sick to
my stomach,'' said Vadillo, who was a teacher at St. Mary when
Wishard was a senior priest. ''I could go my whole life without
hearing this.''</TE>
<TE>   Wishard and Fessard were among the seven priests removed by Mahony
in February. The cardinal said he regretted that he had not dismissed
all of the priests a decade ago.</TE>
<TE>   Mahony emerged in recent meetings with Pope John Paul II in Rome
and U.S. bishops in Dallas as a forceful advocate of changes in the
church's policies on sexual abuse. The cardinal frequently appeared
on television and at news conferences to promote strict policies
requiring the immediate removal of all sex offenders from ministry.</TE>
<TE>   Mahony said much of the language contained in a "zero tolerance"
policy approved by U.S. bishops in June is based on programs that he
implemented over the years in Los Angeles. Moreover, he vowed in
Dallas that any bishop who covered up such misconduct by reassigning
priests should find it "impossible to remain in office."</TE>
<TE>   Mahony deserves credit for taking "pioneering steps" in 1992 when
he began removing priests from ministry who were credibly accused of
molesting minors, said Mark Chopko, general counsel for the U.S.
Conference of Catholic Bishops. "He has been very much upfront and
public about dealing openly and effectively with sexual misconduct
issues," Chopko said.</TE>
<TE>   In 1992, he recalled, Mahony was the only bishop willing to initiate a
dialogue with victims of sexual abuse who were protesting at an annual
bishops conference in Washington.</TE>
<TE>   After listening to the victims, Mahony told fellow bishops that
the session had been "one of the most moving experiences I have ever
known." He said that the Catholic Church must "show herself as a
loving, caring and healing church and not as a legal obstacle
protecting errant priests at all costs."</TE>
<TE>   But some alleged victims contend that Mahony has offered them
little more than lip service over the years.</TE>
<TE>   "How he looks at himself in the morning is beyond me," said Lee
Bashforth, who, with his brother, is suing over allegations that they
were sexually abused by a Los Angeles Archdiocese priest. "There's
not an ounce of genuine remorse for myself, my brother and scores of
other victims."</TE>
<TE>   Mahony has succeeded in cultivating a public image as a reformer,
but his "level of deceit parallels that of Cardinal [Bernard] Law,"
said Jeffrey R. Anderson, a Minnesota attorney who has represented
more than 400 victims of clergy sexual abuse nationwide and filed the
class-action suit against the Los Angeles Archdiocese.</TE>
<TE>   Mahony said comparisons with Law are unfair. He said the practice
in Boston of reassigning priests who had previously received
treatment and offended again had not occurred on his watch in Los
Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   The cardinal said that the sex abuse scandal has taken a heavy
toll on him personally.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't sleep at night because of it. I don't go two,
three minutes a day when this [isn't] in my mind," he said. "It's
dreadful."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Mahony Has Faced Issue for Two Decades</TE>
<TE>   For nearly all of his more than two decades as a bishop, first in
Stockton and then in Los Angeles, Mahony has been forced to deal with
cases of sexual abuse by priests.</TE>
<TE>   As bishop of Stockton, he inherited the case of Father Oliver
O'Grady, a parish priest who had admitted years earlier to molesting
an 11-year-old girl. In 1984, O'Grady told a therapist that he had
sexual urges toward a young boy. Mahony sent O'Grady for evaluation
to a local psychiatrist, John C. Morris, who said the priest had a
"severe defect in maturation" and suggested that "perhaps Oliver is
not truly called to the priesthood."</TE>
<TE>   Mahony promoted O'Grady to serve as pastor of a rural parish,
where he molested three victims, including a baby girl who suffered
vaginal scarring. O'Grady was later convicted of 21 counts of felony
sexual abuse and served seven years in prison before returning to his
native Ireland. A jury in 1998 awarded two O'Grady victims a record
$30-million judgment, which later was reduced to $7 million.</TE>
<TE>   Jurors said in interviews that they had found Mahony untruthful in
his testimony and held him responsible for allowing O'Grady's pattern
of abuse to continue.</TE>
<TE>   "He didn't act soon enough or strong enough," said juror Laura
Utterback of Stockton. "He didn't remove the problem. He just kept
hiding it."</TE>
<TE>   Until now, Mahony has not commented publicly on the case. "I felt
the jury was wrong," he said. "I was flabbergasted that we were held
accountable, because I thought we took extraordinary steps to make
sure there was no problem." The precautions included sending O'Grady
to therapy and ordering a second psychiatric evaluation, the one
performed by Morris.</TE>
<TE>   Shortly after Mahony moved to Los Angeles in 1985, he said, he
discovered that his predecessor, Cardinal Timothy Manning, had no
written guidelines on how to handle reported molestation cases.
Mahony said he directed his staff to begin drafting policies.</TE>
<TE>   The first guidelines, adopted in June 1989, called for the
archdiocese to have a priest who faced credible allegations undergo
psychiatric evaluation and to rely on therapists to help determine
future assignments.</TE>
<TE>   Mahony said this approach changed in 1992 after the arrest of
Father Richard Allen Henry, a parish priest who was later sentenced
to eight years in prison for sexually abusing four boys from the same
family.</TE>
<TE>   Records show that the archdiocese posted Henry's $30,000 bail,
paid for his therapy and declined to announce the reason for his
departure from Our Lady of the Rosary Church in Paramount. At the
sentencing hearing, a top Mahony aide asked the judge to free Henry
on probation.</TE>
<TE>   Still, Mahony said, the Henry case persuaded him that the
archdiocese could no longer rely on psychiatric treatment to
rehabilitate priests who sexually exploited children. "It was very
clear from '92 on, there was only one course of action and that was,
these guys had to go," he said.</TE>
<TE>   In 1992, according to Mahony, he implemented two sweeping reforms:
a zero-tolerance policy that removed from ministry any priest found
by the archdiocese to have abused a minor, and the creation of an
advisory panel to review cases of sexual misconduct and make private
recommendations to the cardinal.</TE>
<TE>   Copies of the sexual abuse policy, however, show that no changes
in language were made in 1992. Revisions were made in 1994, 1996 and
1997, but they made no mention of removing clerics from the
priesthood if they were found guilty of molesting minors. Instead,
these policies specifically permitted Mahony, on the basis of "advice
from experts in the field," to return to ministry priests who had
sexually abused minors.</TE>
<TE>   Nonetheless, Mahony followed through on his initial commitment in
1992 to begin removing priests who were credibly accused of molesting
minors, attorneys for the archdiocese said. Some of these cases
involved older priests who were forced to retire. They include an
81-year-old monsignor who suffered a heart attack and is disabled, a
74-year-old parish priest who was institutionalized in 1997 and a
62-year-old cleric who never returned after being sent out of state
for treatment.</TE>
<TE>   It was not until February of this year that language requiring the
removal of any priest found to have molested a minor was added to
archdiocese policy. Mahony was forced to adopt a "zero tolerance"
policy as part of a $5.2-million settlement that the archdiocese and
the Diocese of Orange negotiated last year with one abuse victim,
Ryan DiMaria. This agreement led Mahony to remove the seven priests
in February who had been accused of sexual abuse before 1992.</TE>
<TE>   Mahony said that he began thinking last summer about the need to
take action against the seven.</TE>
<TE>   "I really need to be able to stand on the pulpit and look at the
people of this archdiocese and say, 'I can assure you as humanly as
possible, there is no priest out there who has abused a minor,' " he
said. "I said I can't do that, but I'm going to do it and we're going
to make this change. So we bit the bullet."</TE>
<TE>   Critics charge that Mahony is reinventing history.</TE>
<TE>   "I've never heard of any significant policies, procedures or
statements made by Roger Mahony until most recently when he tried to
... create some sort of illusion that he is or was some great
innovator in the area, which he is not," said Father Thomas Doyle, a
former canon lawyer who co-wrote a confidential 1985 church report on
sexual abuse that warned U.S. bishops of a looming crisis.</TE>
<TE>   Mahony acknowledged that he had concluded only recently that
priests who exploit children no longer deserve the title "father."</TE>
<TE>   His greatest regret, Mahony said, is waiting until earlier this
year to remove from ministry every priest who had engaged in a single
act of sexual abuse of a minor, even if it occurred decades ago.</TE>
<TE>   "If we're going to have the church safe for children and young
people, [the policy] has to be absolutely tight and foolproof as
possible," he said. "There is no room for exceptions."</TE>

Section A should have indicated that the Los Angeles Archdiocese and
the Diocese of Orange shared the cost of a $1.2-million settlement
involving alleged sexual misconduct by Father John Lenihan, not
Father Michael S. Baker. The Los Angeles Archdiocese and Baker shared
the cost of a $1.3-million settlement involving accusations against

<LD>I consider myself a loyal guy. For example, there's nothing I
wouldn't do for my country or the Los Angeles Times. All they have to
do is ask.</LD>
<LD>   The Westminster City Council, though, has me wondering if I even
know what loyalty means. It has me thinking I might be some kind of
lowlife who'd sell out his friends in a second.</LD>
<LD>   Either that, or council members need one of those retreats to
clear their heads.</LD>
<TE>   Last week, the council voted 5-0 to oust Planning Commissioner
Stephen Nevarez after the councilman who appointed him felt he was
disloyal.</TE>
<TE>   Sounds serious. Did Nevarez leak city secrets to Garden Grove?
Move to Anaheim?</TE>
<TE>   No. He decided to run for City Council in November. In
Westminster, this can land you alongside Benedict Arnold in the
annals of treachery.</TE>
<TE>   Nevarez's sin is that he's running in the same election as
Councilman Russell Paris, who appointed Nevarez to the commission in
December 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Never mind that Nevarez isn't running against Paris, as such. Two
council seats are open and four candidates are on the ballot. Nevarez
and Paris both could win seats. Of course, it's also possible that
Nevarez could knock Paris off the council.</TE>
<TE>   There's the rub. Paris says he couldn't abide Nevarez's running
against him and exercised his prerogative as Nevarez's appointer to
end his 19-month service on the commission. The other four council
members, also exercising an unwritten rule to endorse any colleagues'
authority to un-appoint their appointees, fell meekly in step.</TE>
<TE>   Keep in mind Paris isn't saying Nevarez did a poor job.</TE>
<TE>   "I have a quirk," Paris says. "I thought he was being disloyal to
me, and I gave him the out of resigning [from the commission]. If
he'd resigned, I wouldn't have cared at all about him running. I
personally like Steve, we belong to the same Kiwanis Club. It's hard
to do what I did, but I felt it was something I had to do."</TE>
<TE>   Nevarez first broached the idea to Paris several months ago. Paris
asked him not to, considering it a betrayal in that Paris gave
Nevarez his entry into local politics.</TE>
<TE>   A World War II and Korean War vet who rose to full colonel, Paris,
76, says loyalty matters. "I guess I'm from an older generation that
thinks of certain things in different ways," he says. "In this day
and age, that doesn't mean a darn thing. Maybe I'm a different
brand."</TE>
<TE>   Colonel, loyalty does matter. This just isn't the Audie Murphy
moment you make it out to be.</TE>
<TE>   Nevarez and Paris agree they never discussed Nevarez's not running
this year, when Paris--who was appointed to the council in
2000--would run for election. More to the point, are Westminster
planning commissioners such inconsequential figures that a councilman
can pull the plug in a fit of pique?</TE>
<TE>   I guess so, because Paris openly acknowledges that, "To me, this
is personal."</TE>
<TE>   Nevarez, 41, says he's not mad at the other council members for
backing Paris, because he thinks it's important that a member's
wishes regarding his or her appointees be honored.</TE>
<TE>   Nor is Nevarez especially upset with Paris, although he says he
wouldn't dump an appointee under these circumstances. To Paris'
credit, Nevarez says, he never told him how to vote during his time
on the commission, which would have ended in December anyway, unless
he were reappointed.</TE>
<TE>   "I can understand how he sees it," Nevarez says. "What it boils
down to is we have a difference in beliefs [about loyalty]. I'm not
being disloyal to Russ."</TE>
<TE>   My vote goes to Nevarez. Not to be naive about it, but you'd like
to think competence is the issue when it comes to removing public
servants.</TE>
<TE>   Not to Paris, a former planning commissioner himself who's been
around way too long to start acting like a jilted boyfriend.</TE>
<TE>   When I take a look at this situation, I wonder who's being
disloyal to whom?</TE>

<HD>4 Cases Provide a Glimpse of How Archdiocese Responded</HD>
<DH>Priest Fled to Mexico and Is Still a Fugitive</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>A mother contacted the Los Angeles Archdiocese on Jan. 6, 1988, to
report that a priest at Our Lady of Guadalupe Church, a predominantly
Latino parish in the foothills of El Sereno, had molested her two
young sons, according to police records. Two days later, another
parent alerted the principal at the Catholic grade school that the
same priest had abused a boy.</LD>
<LD>   The calls prompted then-Monsignor Thomas J. Curry, a top aide to
Cardinal Roger M. Mahony, to visit Father Nicolas Aguilar Rivera on
Jan. 9, a Saturday. Curry informed Aguilar that he could no longer
serve in the archdiocese, pending an investigation, and offered to
find him temporary living quarters.</LD>
<LD>   Aguilar, a visiting priest who had spent the previous nine months at
the Los Angeles Archdiocese, told Curry that he would return to his native
Mexico in the next few days.</LD>
<TE>   Curry reported back to Mahony, according to church sources, but
did not notify police of Aguilar's intentions. On Jan. 11, a Monday,
the school principal contacted the Los Angeles Police Department.
That same morning, detectives took statements from seven young
students who said they had been molested. But police could not locate
Aguilar, who had left for Mexico within hours of his meeting with
Curry.</TE>
<TE>   The investigators then sought to interview additional possible
victims at schools near the two parishes where Aguilar had worked.
When the archdiocese refused to provide a roster of altar boys,
detectives began pulling students, one by one, out of classrooms. In
all, they talked to 63 students and found 26 boys who said Aguilar
had molested them, according to police reports.</TE>
<TE>   The list of altar boys was withheld by Sister Judith Ann Murphy,
an archdiocese attorney, at the recommendation of Curry and with
Mahony's approval, church officials said. Curry and the cardinal were
concerned about fueling fears of a police crackdown on illegal
immigrants at the two predominantly Latino parishes, they said.</TE>
<TE>   On April 15, 1988, the district attorney's office filed a 19-count
felony complaint charging Aguilar with sexually abusing 10 minors.
Charges were filed in Mexico in 1988, but Aguilar could not be found.
In 1995, a Mexican judge dismissed the charges because the statute of
limitations had expired.</TE>
<TE>   Aguilar is still being sought by prosecutors in Los Angeles.
"There is a lot of frustration, definitely," said Deputy Dist. Atty.
Janice Maurizi. "We don't know for sure that Father Rivera is still
in Mexico. For that matter, we don't know he is still alive."</TE>
<TE>   Authorities accuse the archdiocese of impeding their inquiry.
Their concerns led to a March 9, 1988, meeting with Mahony to discuss
the issue of cooperation. "I just felt they would have more concern
for the victims in this case," said Gary Lyon, a retired LAPD sex
crimes detective who attended the meeting. "It seemed to me they were
more concerned about protecting the image of the church and the
priesthood than they were the children involved."</TE>
<TE>   Mahony said he had little knowledge of the Aguilar case. Curry
declined to comment, although, in a letter to a parishioner, he
denied any attempt to hinder the investigation.</TE>
<TE>   Mahony acknowledged that the response to the Aguilar case "wasn't
sufficient." He said the archdiocese has changed its polices in
responding to allegations of sexual abuse. "Right now, when we get an
allegation of abuse of a minor, we're right on the phone to the
police department ... not to the priest," he said. "Part of the pain
of this whole thing is, I wish we had known then what we know now."</TE>

<HD>Rep. Condit's Wife Sues Another Tabloid</HD>

<BD>From Times Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The wife of U.S. Rep. Gary Condit is suing the Star tabloid magazine
for $15 million, claiming it libeled her by saying she threatened to
kill herself because of her husband's relationship with federal
intern Chandra Levy, whose skeletal remains were found May 22 in
Washington, D.C.</LD>
<LD>   In the suit, filed Friday in U.S. District Court in Fresno,
Carolyn Condit said the magazine knowingly published falsehoods in a
Sept. 11, 2001, cover story, including claims that she threatened to
kill herself, trashed the family house and sought counseling.</LD>
<LD>   The suit said the statements "could falsely convey to the reader
that [Carolyn Condit] is an intemperate hothead who will do or say
anything to get the attention of her husband and who acts wildly out
of control."</LD>
<TE>   Her suit also asked for an apology and a retraction from
defendants Star Editorial and American Media.</TE>

<HD>101 Guinea Pigs Are Successfully Relocated</HD>

<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>After 10 days traveling across country in a Winnebago dubbed the
"Piggybago," four Peninsula Humane Society volunteers returned home
Friday to the San Francisco Bay area. The "Guinea Pig Crusaders" had
delivered 101 of the little critters to new homes from Salt Lake City
to Toledo, Ohio.</LD>
<LD>   They returned with two extras. One guinea pig was rescued from a
research lab in Wisconsin and will be delivered next week to
Vancouver. Another was an extra loaded accidentally when the mobile
home departed from San Mateo on Aug. 5. It had no designated home, so
it was returned.</LD>
<LD>   The cross-country rescue effort was launched after 350 guinea pigs
were turned in to the SPCA of Monterey County after a couple who bred
them for biomedical research lost their lease.</LD>

<HD>Carny King's Sideshow Must Go On</HD>
<DH>Fairs: Fillmore retiree lovingly tends to his collection of
freaks and oddities, though public interest has waned.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE CHAWKINS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Like many other retirees, Bobby Reynolds still likes to keep a hand
in the business.</LD>
<LD>   In his case, that means changing the formaldehyde for Ronnie and
Donnie the Two-Headed Baby and firing off one-liners like the one
about his date with the half-man, half-woman.</LD>
<LD>   "Guy asked me did I have a good time," he says. "I told him, yes
and no."</LD>
<TE>   At 67, Reynolds is one of the last remaining grand old men of
American sideshows. He lives on a scrubby nine-acre spread in
Fillmore. His living room is painted black and rigged up with an
overhead rack of stage lights. Pictures of the immortals--P.T.
Barnum, Tom Thumb, Kokomo the Mule-Faced Boy--line the walls. On a
long table sits a fluid-filled bell jar holding a mustached object
that Reynolds halfheartedly insists is the head of Pancho Villa.</TE>
<TE>   "It was in a museum in Mexico and there was an earthquake," he
says. "Bada-bing, bada-boom."</TE>
<TE>   The times have not been kind to free-spirited entrepreneurs like
Reynolds. When he was young, as many as 200 sideshows crisscrossed
the country, displaying their freight of contortionists, five-legged
sheep, scantily clad girls, and "human blockheads" who shoved
screwdrivers up their noses and spikes in their tongues.</TE>
<TE>   But carnival and fair operators came to reap a lot more profit
from big, expensive rides. And the public's appetite for what used to
be called "human oddities" dwindled.</TE>
<TE>   "Now it's not OK to put on a fat lady and charge to see her," said
John Strates, the third-generation operator of a carnival train that
chugs up and down the East Coast. "A two-headed baby is not
politically correct. You get e-mails about sideshows right and left."</TE>
<TE>   Reynolds isn't out on the road much these days. This fall, he and
his Reynolds' Believe It You're Nuts show will be the centerpiece at
a collegiate art festival in Maryland. Afterward, he might swing down
to the Carolinas. He says he could get more work, but he ruefully
acknowledges that the golden era of sideshows is long past.</TE>
<TE>   "They're trying to make Disneyland out of fairs," he says, "and it
ain't working."</TE>
<TE>   At home, Reynolds helps out his 11th wife, Ruth, who had a stroke
a couple of years ago. Her previous husband was a circus man named
Big John Strong. Her grown kids and a couple of his from assorted
marriages drift in and out. One recent afternoon, Reynolds was
visited by a Mormon missionary--Reynolds became a Mormon last
spring--and a 7-foot, 2-inch sword swallower from Bakersfield named
George McArthur.</TE>
<TE>   "Meet George the Giant, the Goliath of the 21st century!" Reynolds
orates by way of introduction.</TE>
<TE>   McArthur, 32, has been on the road with Reynolds, who taught him
the fine points of swallowing swords. And fire. And lightbulbs.</TE>
<TE>   "They were calling me a freak when I was 10 years old and
6-foot-7," McArthur says. "Now at least I'm paid for it."</TE>
<TE>   From time to time, some of Reynolds' fellow performers have lived
in trailers on his ranch. Dave Twomey, known professionally as Happy
the Clown, was there recently after treatments for cancer. Jimmy
Webb--a.k.a. the Ugliest Man in the World--was a longtime guest, as
was a hirsute woman who eventually grew disenchanted with life as a
freak.</TE>
<TE>   "When your bearded lady starts to shave, you know she really wants
out of show business," Reynolds observes.</TE>
<TE>   For him, that is inconceivable. Reynolds is on all the time. In
the space of two hours, he dons a pith helmet, a fez and a top hat.
He does coin tricks, spews carny patter, bursts into a medley from
"Fiddler on the Roof" and hauls a dummy out of his closet for a quick
display of ventriloquism. In between, he relaxes with an endless
chain of ancient one-liners.</TE>
<TE>   "I've been married so many times I got rice marks," he says. "I
got three rings: Engagement ring, wedding ring and suffering.... "</TE>
<TE>   Growing up in Jersey City, N.J., he started his professional life
at 13 as a pitchman for a Coney Island attraction called Professor
Heckler's Trained Flea Circus. By night he slept in a cardboard box
under the boardwalk. By day he reveled in his spiel, which he will
still rattle off at the drop of a pith helmet:</TE>
<TE>   "Fleas that juggle, jump through hoops, play football, operate a
miniature merry-go-round, tiny little fleas hitched to a chariot and
they actually run a race.... It is without a doubt the most
fascinating sight the human eye has ever witnessed!"</TE>
<TE>   At one time, Reynolds had 14 shows plying the midways of America.
His "museum show" featured items that were purportedly pickled, like
Van Gogh's ear. Another had strange animals, some with extra limbs.
Like other showmen of the day, he displayed actual fetuses, like the
two-headed baby, ostensibly to illustrate the evils of drugs and
alcohol.</TE>
<TE>   Today's handful of sideshow equivalents are more extreme. The Jim
Rose Circus, for instance, features Mr. Lifto, a man who lifts
weights dangling from his pierced nipples and other body parts.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't put Jim Rose down," Reynolds says. "If I wanted to earn
real money now, I'd have to resort to things like that too."</TE>
<TE>   Over the years, Reynolds has performed himself. Among other
things, he did an act with a tap-dancing chicken--a chicken trying to
shake off the pieces of tape Reynolds had stuck to its feet.</TE>
<TE>   "We were supposed to be on the [Ed] Sullivan Show but I got drunk
and missed the rehearsal," says Reynolds, a recovering alcoholic who
has been sober for 21 years. "Who knows what would have happened?"</TE>
<TE>   Now and then, Reynolds, like other sideshow operators, ran into
legal difficulties.</TE>
<TE>   In 1985, his "giant rat" was confiscated at the Ventura County
Fair. Police deduced that the 100-pound beast was not a killer from
the sewers of Paris, as advertised, but a South American rodent
called a capybara.</TE>
<TE>   Reynolds says the case was dismissed when he showed the judge a
magazine caption calling a capybara "the swamp rat of Brazil."</TE>
<TE>   That isn't how the arresting officer remembers it, however.</TE>
<TE>   "He's just so full of smoke," said Steve Bowman, a private
investigator now retired from Ventura's Police Department. "He
pleaded guilty and paid a $500 fine."</TE>
<TE>   For all that, Reynolds ran his shows with "a convoluted sense of
honesty," according to Dick Horne, one of just a few sideshow
scholars.</TE>
<TE>   Horne and his partner, James Taylor, operate Baltimore's American
Dime Museum, an exhibit hall crammed with sideshow memorabilia. One
of the featured attractions was acquired from Reynolds: The
Horrifying Giant Kentucky Redwood Bat--12 feet long and 600 pounds,
fairgoers were told, "big enough to kill a horse!"</TE>
<TE>   The monster is an oversized baseball bat.</TE>
<TE>   "But it really does weigh 600 pounds," Horne said. "Bobby could
just as easily have gotten one made of Styrofoam but instead he had
this huge thing carved."</TE>
<TE>   Horne helped set up an upcoming appearance by Reynolds at the
Maryland Institute College of Art.</TE>
<TE>   For 10 days, Reynolds will be on hand with his musical frogs
(stuffed and holding tiny instruments), his two-headed goose, his
sword swallowers, his fire-eaters, and such smoke-and-mirrors
illusions as No-Middle Myrtle, the stomachless girl from the isle of
Ahamamamagoola. Three trucks will haul his "circus museum"--a display
120 feet long and 70 feet wide--to the urban campus.</TE>
<TE>   Fred Lazarus, the institute's president, said the show will be a
learning experience on many levels, from the graphics of hand-painted
circus banners to the aesthetics of the bizarre.</TE>
<TE>   "There's also this whole issue of freaks and stereotypes," Lazarus
said. "It will be useful in opening us to thinking differently about
people who are different."</TE>
<TE>   For his part, Reynolds, who modestly calls himself "the world's
greatest showman," admits that throngs of adoring young people will
get his blood pumping.</TE>
<TE>   "Kind of like Tony Bennett," he says.</TE>

<HD>Tape of Beating Brings Tips on Reacting to Police</HD>
<DH>Education: Project advises motorists on what to do when
pulled over in traffic stops.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEAN MERL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In the days after the videotaped police beating of a 16-year-old boy
in Inglewood, community activists in Compton and other largely
minority communities devised a project that they hope will help avoid
further violent confrontations during traffic stops.</LD>
<LD>   Working with the Los Angeles County sheriff's deputies who patrol
Compton, a coalition of civic and religious leaders put together a
detailed pamphlet that advises motorists on ways to keep things calm
and cool when they are pulled over by officers.</LD>
<LD>   "Lots of citizens have anger, fear and trepidation about the
police, and they don't realize they can make a difference" in the
outcome of an encounter with officers, physician James Mays said
Saturday at a forum to introduce the pamphlet.</LD>
<TE>   Mays and other leaders said they are not trying to let
heavy-handed police officers off the hook. They said they want to
help prevent an otherwise "good" stop from going bad by educating
residents about their responsibilities.</TE>
<TE>   "We hope this will bring about healing," said another forum
organizer, the Rev. Lowe Barry.</TE>
<TE>   The project grew out of the incident in Inglewood last month, when
a police officer slammed a handcuffed Donovan Jackson, 16, onto a
patrol car and punched him in the face. Officers had been questioning
Jackson's father about expired license tags. A bystander caught much
of the incident on videotape, and it has sparked outrage in Southern
California and around the nation.</TE>
<TE>   Two Inglewood officers have been suspended and face trial, one on
an assault charge, the other on a charge of filing a false police
report.</TE>
<TE>   Sheriff's Capt. Cecil Rhambo, commander of the Compton station,
said he was happy to help with the project that community leaders
proposed.</TE>
<TE>   "Law enforcement spends a great deal of time training officers....
We felt there needed to be something that gives citizens something of
the perspective of a law officer," he said.</TE>
<TE>   But Rhambo, who grew up in South-Central Los Angeles and is well
acquainted with some minority group members' experiences with police,
was quick to add that he did not mean to imply motorists were solely
at fault.</TE>
<TE>   "There are a lot of factors that go into" how a traffic stop
progresses, he said, and "everyone involved has some responsibility"
to see that cool heads prevail.</TE>
<TE>   With a volunteer "subject" behind the wheel of a white sport
utility vehicle, deputies made two simulated stops to show how a
motorist's demeanor could make a difference.</TE>
<TE>   Mays said leaders devised the pamphlet after their research showed
that there were few resources for parents who want to teach their
teenage children how to avoid trouble if they are pulled over. It is
designed to be a "common-sense teaching and discussion" tool for
families, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Mays also said he hopes that the education project will be
emulated throughout California and in other major cities.</TE>
<TE>   He wants to highlight it in another community forum, with the Los
Angeles Police Department, in about two weeks.</TE>
<TE>   The "Citizens/Law Enforcement Encounter/Detention Information
Pamphlet" lists responsibilities of citizens and law enforcement
officers, and includes instructions on what to do if stopped and how
to handle the situation if a motorist is unhappy with the way the
encounter went.</TE>
<TE>   Among the suggestions for motorists:</TE>
<TE>   "Calmly obey officer's instructions or demands.</TE>
<TE>   "Keep hands visible at all times.</TE>
<TE>   "Do not reach for documents or objects (such as cell phone)
without instructions or permission from the officer.</TE>
<TE>   "Realize that the officer is the authority with the legal and
lethal force."</TE>
<TE>   The pamphlet also urges motorists to be polite and cooperative and
to get the officer's name or to calmly request the presence of a
supervisor if things seem to be getting out of hand.</TE>
<TE>   Patricia Corona, a mother of three teenagers, said she was
grateful for the advice and would use the pamphlet in a family
discussion.</TE>
<TE>   "I think this will be helpful to my children," she said. "We
really need more things like this, because the community and the
police have to be working together and helping each other."</TE>

<HD>4 Cases Provide a Glimpse of How Archdiocese Responded</HD>
<DH>Contact With Children Was Prohibited</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Archdiocese officials say they are proud of how they handled the case
of Father Carl Sutphin, one of seven clerics Cardinal Roger M. Mahony
removed in February, forcing him to take early retirement.</LD>
<LD>   Records show that Sutphin was immediately relieved of active
ministry in 1991, when the archdiocese received an allegation of
sexual abuse. Andrew Cicchillo, now a Phoenix Web site manager,
reported Sutphin had molested him and his twin brother more than 20
years before, while the priest was associate pastor at St. Rose of
Lima Church in Maywood.</LD>
<LD>   Cicchillo wrote Mahony that he was breaking his silence because he
had found that the priest had been reassigned to St. John's Hospital
in Oxnard "with access to children 24 hours a day, in the pediatric
ward. This also must present many opportunities for him to molest."</LD>
<TE>   The letter prompted a call from Monsignor Timothy J. Dyer--then
the archdiocese's vicar for clergy, in charge of all parish
priests--who vowed that Sutphin "would not wear a collar, would be
retired and would not have any duties," Cicchillo said.</TE>
<TE>   Although acknowledging that he had "made some unwise decisions" in
overseeing priests in the archdiocese during his five years as vicar
of clergy, Dyer declined to discuss specific cases. "We're all
struggling to understand what has happened and why. We know we have a
problem that needs to be fixed," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Sutphin was sent to St. Luke's Institute in Maryland for a
five-day evaluation, then returned two months later for individual
therapy that continued until June 1992, church records show.</TE>
<TE>   Back in Los Angeles, he was placed on restrictive ministry:
prohibited from having contact with children and assigned as chaplain
to a retirement home for priests. In 1995, he was transferred to St.
Vibiana's Cathedral, where he lived in the same rectory as Mahony.
Sutphin moved into the new Our Lady of the Angels Cathedral with the
cardinal and other priests in March 2001.</TE>
<TE>   Archdiocese officials said Sutphin, 69, continued
receiving regular therapy, led a 12-step program for Spanish-speaking
sex abusers and ministered to downtown homeless and jail inmates.</TE>
<TE>   "The priests were aware of his past, found him to be a good
companion, a faithful worker in several gritty assignments for a man
of his age, and we never had a hint of any inappropriate conduct,"
said Monsignor Kevin Kostelnik, pastor of the soon-to-open cathedral.</TE>
<TE>   Mahony said he never broached the subject of sexual abuse with
Sutphin at St. Vibiana's or the new cathedral.</TE>
<TE>   The archdiocese has no record that anyone confronted Sutphin about
a second sexual abuse allegation, in 1994.</TE>
<TE>   A retired Catholic-school teacher, who asked to remain
unidentified, said she had told a monsignor that Sutphin had molested
her young sons during the mid-1970s.</TE>
<TE>   One of the sons said in an interview that Dyer told him: "Hey,
this could be embarrassing for you if this got into the paper. We
could handle this in a confidential way ... and your name doesn't get
thrown out there."</TE>
<TE>   The retired teacher, whose sons, along with the Cicchillos, are
suing the archdiocese, said she would have been treated much
differently, had an allegation been lodged against her.</TE>
<TE>   "Not only would I have been reported to police, I would have
lost my credential to teach," she said, "and I certainly wouldn't be
living with the superintendent of schools."</TE>

<LD>With approval given by Gov. Gray Davis, construction of a state home
for military veterans in Saticoy could begin within two years, state
officials said.</LD>
<LD>   The home will have about 110 beds--60 for permanent residents and
the rest for elderly veterans who need care during the day. Last week
the governor signed bills authorizing construction of veterans homes
in West Los Angeles, Lancaster and Saticoy. The next hurdle is
approval by the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs.</LD>

<HD>No Leaders of Al Qaeda Found at Guantanamo</HD>
<DH>Intelligence: U.S. efforts to learn valuable information
about terrorist cells and plots have been frustrated at the prison
camp.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BOB DROGIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Despite intense interrogations and investigations, U.S. authorities
have yet to identify any senior Al Qaeda leaders among the nearly 600
terrorism suspects from 43 countries in U.S. military custody at
Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, officials say.</LD>
<LD>   The failure to find high-ranking Al Qaeda officials has frustrated
intelligence, law enforcement and military authorities, who had hoped
to harvest far more valuable information about global terrorism
structures and operations.</LD>
<LD>   Although some of the information has been helpful, officials said,
the interrogations at the high-security prison camp have not provided
the kind of details needed to identify new Al Qaeda cells or to
detect specific terrorist plots.</LD>
<TE>   "It's not roll-up-plots, knock-your-socks-off-kind of stuff," said
a U.S. intelligence official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.</TE>
<TE>   The official said the 598 inmates flown to the U.S. Navy base in
eastern Cuba since January are mostly "low-and middle-level" fighters
and supporters, not "the big-time guys" high enough in the command
and control structure to help counter-terrorism experts unravel Al
Qaeda's tightknit cell and security systems.</TE>
<TE>   Another official who has visited the seaside detention facility
called Camp Delta said U.S. authorities had netted "no big fish"
there. "Some of these guys literally don't know the world is round,"
the official said.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the prisoners were captured on the battlefield in
Afghanistan last fall or during subsequent raids and sweeps conducted
by United States and allied authorities.</TE>
<TE>   The most recent group of 34 prisoners arrived in Cuba on Aug. 5
and included several alleged Islamic militants seized in Pakistan.
Other suspects have been brought from Bosnia-Herzegovina and other
parts of Europe.</TE>
<TE>   The Bush administration has declared those held at Guantanamo Bay
to be "enemy combatants," a murky legal and political status that
apparently has added to stress there.</TE>
<TE>   About 200 defiant inmates joined hunger strikes last spring to
protest their detention. More recently, the military has registered
30 "self-harm incidents," including suicide attempts, according to
Lt. Col. Joe Hoey, a military spokesman at the camp.</TE>
<TE>   In the last six weeks alone, he said, three inmates have tried to
hang themselves in their cells with camp-issued "comfort items" such
as towels and sheets, and another tried to slit his wrists with a
plastic razor. None has succeeded.</TE>
<TE>   Hoey said camp doctors are treating some detainees for
psychological disorders and have administered antidepressants and
antipsychotic drugs. One inmate was repatriated in April to an
undisclosed country after doctors deemed him mentally ill.</TE>
<TE>   Not everyone apparently is eager to leave, however. One official
said several inmates have inquired about learning English and
applying for political asylum in America, saying they fear
imprisonment, persecution or worse if they are sent home.</TE>
<TE>   That isn't likely anytime soon. The prisoners are monitored by the
International Red Cross, but they have not been charged in court,
brought before a military tribunal or provided with lawyers.</TE>
<TE>   And on Aug. 1, responding to two lawsuits brought on behalf of 14
detainees, U.S. District Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly ruled that the
detainees don't have a right to appear in U.S. courts and that the
military may hold them indefinitely.</TE>
<TE>   Officials concede they have not confirmed the identity of everyone
being held at Guantanamo Bay. Many prisoners either carried false
identity documents or none at all, or have given a variety of names
and aliases.</TE>
<TE>   Al Qaeda routinely provided false or stolen passports to some of
its operatives.</TE>
<TE>   "Most of them have given us more than one identification," said
Steve Lucas, a military spokesman in Miami. "We are not always sure
who they represent, from foot soldiers to leadership. They tell
different stories at different times."</TE>
<TE>   Lucas said the military would not publicly name any of the
prisoners to protect their privacy, and to avoid providing
potentially useful information to terrorist groups looking for
missing members.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a sensitive matter as to who is at large and who isn't," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   Some names have begun to emerge, however.</TE>
<TE>   Although U.S. authorities censor their mail, prisoners are allowed
to write to their families via the Red Cross. Among those who
recently told his family he is at Guantanamo Bay: the Taliban's
former ambassador to Pakistan, Mullah Abdul Salam Zaeef.</TE>
<TE>   After the war in Afghanistan began in October, Zaeef held frequent
news conferences at the Afghan Embassy in Islamabad to denounce
America. Pakistan denied his application for political asylum after
Afghanistan's ruling Taliban regime collapsed in December, and he
later was arrested and handed over to U.S. authorities.</TE>
<TE>   Another prisoner who allegedly fought for the Taliban, Yaser Esam
Hamdi, was taken from Guantanamo Bay to a Navy brig in Norfolk, Va.,
after he claimed he had been born in Louisiana.</TE>
<TE>   On Friday, a federal judge, Robert G. Doumar, said he would not be
a "rubber stamp" and ordered the government to turn over documents
supporting their argument that Hamdi should remain jailed without
charges and without access to a lawyer.</TE>
<TE>   Some foreign governments have begun to voice similar concerns.</TE>
<TE>   Pakistan's interior minister, Moinuddin Haider, told reporters
Saturday in Karachi that Islamabad would seek the release of some of
the 58 Pakistanis held at Guantanamo Bay. Haider said many of the
detainees were ordinary Muslims who had gone to fight for the Taliban
but were not members of Al Qaeda.</TE>
<TE>   Pakistani intelligence and diplomatic officials visited the camp
to interview prisoners earlier this month.</TE>
<TE>   A similar delegation from Kuwait was at the camp last week to meet
a dozen Kuwaiti prisoners.</TE>
<TE>   Several European countries have quietly offered to take prisoners
home and put them on trial if U.S. officials can provide evidence
that they have committed a crime. None has been released for trial so
far.</TE>
<TE>   After eight months of operation, Camp Delta is now almost full.</TE>
<TE>   Navy engineers last month began building a new wing of 204
one-person cells to house detainees now being held at Bagram Air Base
in Afghanistan and other locations. It is unknown if higher-ranking
Al Qaeda leaders are among them.</TE>
<TE>   Hundreds, if not thousands, of Al Qaeda operatives and commanders
escaped Afghanistan and fled into Pakistan during the battle of Tora
Bora in December. Some authorities believe Al Qaeda leader Osama bin
Laden was among those who escaped.</TE>
<TE>   The most senior figure known to be in U.S. custody is Abu Zubeida,
a key Bin Laden lieutenant. Captured in March during a raid in
central Pakistan, he has been interrogated ever since at an
undisclosed location and apparently has provided highly useful
information on several occasions.</TE>
<TE>   "He's still talking from time to time," one official said. He said
Zubeida was not sent to Guantanamo Bay with the other prisoners
"because we find it easier to talk to him alone."</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. government also has secretly transported some suspects to
Middle Eastern countries that use interrogation tactics, including
torture and threats, that are illegal under U.S. law.</TE>
<TE>   Suspects are known to have been handed over to authorities in
Egypt, Syria, Oman, Jordan and Saudi Arabia.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities believe one such suspect, Mohammed Haydar Zammar,
helped recruit some of the Sept. 11 skyjackers in Hamburg, Germany.</TE>
<TE>   Although he is a German citizen, Zammar was arrested in October
during a visit to Morocco and was secretly flown to his native Syria,
where he was imprisoned. His family and the German government were
notified months later.</TE>

<DL>KAHULUI, Hawaii</DL>
<LD>When 13-year-old Joseph Dickson applied to the Kamehameha Schools, a
prestigious network of private schools for children of Hawaiian
ancestry, he was sure he'd aced it. He had good grades, he played
football and wrestled, the interview went well.</LD>
<LD>   Then Dickson, who is half-native Hawaiian, got the news: Kalani
Rosell, a boy with straight A's but no Hawaiian ancestry, got the
slot. School trustees said they admitted the first non-Hawaiian
student in 36 years because there were no other "qualified" native
Hawaiian applicants.</LD>
<LD>   The decision startled Hawaiians and contributed to an already
rancorous debate statewide about race, preferences and sovereignty.
Native parents circulated petitions demanding new admissions
standards, newspapers carried strident letters on both sides of the
debate, and school trustees were besieged with residents demanding an
explanation.</LD>
<TE>   "When they made this announcement, it was like spears went through
my heart," said Maile Jachowski, a Maui physician and former
valedictorian of the Kamehameha Schools. "It's really, really sad
when you say Hawaiian children aren't smart enough to get into their
own school."</TE>
<TE>   But others applauded the decision, saying programs such as the
Kamehameha Schools should be available to all Hawaiians. "You can't
give a preference and say it's not race discrimination," said
attorney John Goemans, who has urged the Bush administration to
withdraw the schools' federal tax exemption.</TE>
<TE>   For decades, this state has been looked to as a model of racial
harmony. The nation's first Filipino American governor, Ben Cayetano,
hails from here--he succeeded a native Hawaiian and beat out an
Italian American and a Japanese American. Hawaiians are so mixed that
21% claim to belong to two or more races, 10 times the national
average. Nearly half of all marriages these days are mixed race.</TE>
<TE>   The uproar over the school admission on Maui made a lot of people
wonder how much harmony there is here. It occurs at a difficult
moment in Hawaiian racial politics. Increasingly, nonnatives are
arguing with natives that their entitlements for health care,
homesteads and special schools amount to illegal racial preferences.
Native Hawaiians, seeking federal recognition as indigenous people,
are arguing among themselves about what they want. A few go so far as
to call for secession from the United States and formation of an
independent government; others want to restore a quasi-sovereign
Hawaiian government whose interests would be protected by the U.S.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Much Is at Stake</TE>
<TE>   Hundreds of millions of dollars in entitlement programs for native
Hawaiians and control of about half the state--1.8 million acres of
land once belonging to the Hawaiian monarchy--are at stake. Many
Hawaiians have professed amazement at the rancor of the discussion.</TE>
<TE>   "In a multiracial society, it's not good to start dividing people
by race," said Patrick Hanafin, a Honolulu attorney who filed a
lawsuit challenging the entitlement programs. "This is potentially
going to tear Hawaii apart along racial lines, and we think the
Constitution should protect us from that."</TE>
<TE>   Native Hawaiians are building a defense in Congress, seeking
recognition as indigenous people in an attempt to reverse four
decades of federal policy that until now has considered American
Indians and native Alaskans the only indigenous people of the U.S.</TE>
<TE>   The bill, sponsored by Sen. Daniel K. Akaka (D-Hawaii), is stalled
in Congress, in part because of widely varying views among native
Hawaiians about what federal recognition and "sovereignty" might
mean. Some native Hawaiians oppose the Akaka bill because it would
not give them one of the biggest potential prizes of sovereignty:
control over the 1.8 million acres ceded by the Hawaiian monarchy
when the U.S. military helped oust it from power in 1893--including
Pearl Harbor, the University of Hawaii campus and parts of Honolulu
International Airport.</TE>
<TE>   A 1999 survey showed that more than 43% of Hawaiians--evenly split
among natives and nonnatives--either favored or partly favored the
idea of sovereignty in principle. Perhaps more surprisingly, 41.8% of
nonnative residents (compared with 35.4% of native Hawaiians) thought
that natives should manage the ceded lands.</TE>
<TE>   Hawaii's natives occupy a unique position in the American
political landscape. Unlike American Indians, they don't belong to
tribes that were forcibly resettled and recognized as semi-sovereign
"nations within a nation" through treaties. Unlike Alaska's natives,
they weren't allotted millions of acres and the chance to control the
land through their own boards of directors and village councils.</TE>
<TE>   Hawaiians, by contrast, were subjects of a constitutional monarchy
that was overthrown in 1893. The archipelago was admitted as a
territory several years later under an administration dominated by
white sugar barons who used natives as low-paid labor.</TE>
<TE>   "We suffered a unilateral redefinition of our homeland and our
people, a displacement and a dispossession in our own country," said
Haunani-Kay Trask, a writer, professor and leader in the native
Hawaiian sovereignty movement.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Official Apology</TE>
<TE>   Today, native Hawaiians are a little more than 20% of the state's
1.2 million residents, with a disproportionate share of problems. A
third of all victims of child abuse or neglect are natives, and the
functional illiteracy rate is about 30% among native Hawaiian adults.</TE>
<TE>   President Clinton in 1993 signed an official apology acknowledging
the U.S. role in the overthrow of the Hawaiian kingdom and pledging
to establish a foundation for reconciliation with the Hawaiian
people.</TE>
<TE>   What form that takes is a question: With so much intermarriage
over the years, which Hawaiians should be recognized as natives?
Should the Hawaiians have an elected governing body of their own?
Should reparations be paid? What tax money should be available to
fund health care, education and housing programs for Hawaiian
natives? With ceded lands making up nearly half the state, who gets
to control them and what form should that control take?</TE>
<TE>   In addition to the 1.8 million acres, native Hawaiians hold claim
to 200,000 acres set aside by Congress in 1921 for homesteads,
allowing native Hawaiians to take out long-term leases on land at
about $1 a year, with programs often available to help build
affordable homes on the land.</TE>
<TE>   Only about 43,000 acres have been given out over the last 79
years, while the waiting list for homesteads has grown to 19,600
applicants. Many have waited for decades.</TE>
<TE>   "I might be dead by the time I get anything," said Louie Pelekai,
a plumber from Honolulu, who first applied for a homestead in 1976.
He lives with his wife and son in a one-bedroom apartment so small
they are forced to use the bedroom for storage. Pelekai and his son
sleep on the living room floor. "My wife puts three chairs together
and sleeps on them," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Hard-line sovereignty advocates such as Trask have squared off
against the Akaka bill, declaring that they will accept no less than
full self-determination and control of revenues from all ceded lands.
Even some moderates, such as Ikaika Hussey, head of the Democratic
Party's Native Hawaiian Caucus, wonder whether Hawaiians should agree
to become like American Indians rather than hold out for full
independence.</TE>
<TE>   "Our history is that of an independent country in which people
came to us; they wanted to live with us as citizens of an independent
Hawaiian nation," he said. "A lot of indicators point toward
independence as the viable and really the preferred alternative to
the status quo."</TE>
<TE>   Others say it's time to seize on federal recognition as a starting
point. "Federal recognition provides an opportunity for native
Hawaiians to fully embrace and control their future by being able to
control their assets, to be able to establish their own processes,
policies and programs," said Robin Danner of the Council for Native
Hawaiian Advancement.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   A Landmark Case</TE>
<TE>   Almost everyone realizes that federal recognition is an attempt to
defend against court challenges filed by nonnatives, many of whom
were born and raised in the state, who question why natives deserve
land and benefit programs not available to everyone else.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. Supreme Court, in a landmark case in 2000, Rice vs.
Cayetano, rejected the idea that only native Hawaiians or those who
traced their ancestry back to the state's original residents could
vote for trustees of the Office of Hawaiian Affairs, the state agency
that oversees entitlement programs. The court said such distinctions
amount to an illegal racial distinction.</TE>
<TE>   That opened the floodgates, raising questions about whether the
$300-million trust fund that the office administers should be spent
only on programs such as scholarships, housing and business loans for
native Hawaiians.</TE>
<TE>   Also now open to scrutiny are the homestead lands and even the
Kamehameha Schools--although they are oper- ated under a private
trust--because they have a federal tax exemption.</TE>
<TE>   Earl Arakaki, a retired Honolulu police officer, filed a lawsuit
with about a dozen other nonnative residents earlier this year that
seeks to have many of these assets made available for everyone's
benefit. To do otherwise, he believes, constitutes racial
discrimination with tax dollars.</TE>
<TE>   "I believe everyone should be treated equally, and I don't see why
there are racial preferences, and monies to be disbursed, based on
what happened a hundred years ago," Arakaki said. "Last time I
checked, the American flag was still flying out in the state Capitol.
If you want money, work hard and earn it for yourself. I've done it,
and I'm no genius."</TE>
<TE>   The decision to admit a non-Hawaiian to Kamehameha's Maui campus
is where many Hawaiian natives have decided to draw a line. The
school, which serves 3,800 students on three lush campuses, provides
students with an excellent education, in addition to a grounding in
Hawaiian culture and Christian values. Tuition, by private-school
standards, is modest: $1,441 a year for middle school.</TE>
<TE>   Many top professionals and others in leadership positions are
graduates of the Kamehameha Schools, which Pohai Ryan, a 1980
graduate, called "the vehicle Hawaiian people have to rise socially,
politically and economically."</TE>
<TE>   "If they say the Kamehameha School is illegal, watch out. Watch
out," said the Rev. Charles Kauluwehi Maxwell, a prominent native
elder. "The Hawaiians are all loving people, but take away the last
bastion of what they have, which is this school, and watch them
react."</TE>
<TE>   Hamilton McCubbin, chief executive of the schools, acknowledged
that the trustees are concerned about legal challenges but said they
were following their established policies when they admitted the
non-Hawaiian boy. The situation was an unusual one that came about
because an expansion at the Maui campus from 272 students to 592 left
the school with more slots than qualified Hawaiian applicants.</TE>
<TE>   Admissions decisions are based on standardized tests, grade-point
averages, personal interviews, teacher recommendations and writing
samples, and all applicants are normally required to have at least
one native Hawaiian ancestor. This year, McCubbin said, the school
exhausted all Hawaiian students on the eighth-grade wait list before
giving the one remaining slot to Rosell.</TE>
<TE>   A total of 64 eighth-graders applied for 44 spots on the Maui
campus. Eight Hawaiians were immediately screened out of the
admission process and four others did not score the minimum number of
points on a number of evaluation factors to qualify. The Dicksons
said Joseph's interview went well, and they were perplexed when they
got the letter saying he had not been accepted. "I thought he'd be a
preferred candidate," said his mother, Liane.</TE>
<TE>   Last week, trustees announced "interim admissions changes" for the
2003-04 school year only that will eliminate preliminary screening
and the minimum score. The interim policy will also waive the $25
admission fee, all in the hope of attracting more native Hawaiian
applicants.</TE>
<TE>   The trustees have reaffirmed their commitment to native Hawaiian
education, laid out in the will of a former princess when she
established the $6-billion trust for the schools, and they have
pledged to consider admitting not only top academic achievers but
also Hawaiian natives who might be good achievers if given a chance.</TE>
<TE>   "There's a hurt and an anger and a frustration we're seeing now,
which we have absolutely no trouble understanding and empathizing
with," McCubbin said. "The whole organization is unwavering in its
commitment to serving native Hawaiians, but we need to do it in a
manner that's consistent with the law and with policies that have
been approved."</TE>
<TE>   For Joseph Dickson, that is scant comfort. He's been rejected
three times by Kamehameha and will go to public school. For Kalani
Rosell, it's probably a mixed blessing, at best. Jachowski shrugged.
"That boy has the spot of the 20 kids that didn't make it."</TE>

<HD>Experience Called Key in Picking Chief</HD>
<DH>Police: Citizens panel finds support for an LAPD insider.
Race, ethnicity and gender are called irrelevant.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TINA DAUNT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As Los Angeles officials narrowed the list of candidates for police
chief to 21 last week, members of a citizens committee assisting with
the selection process said they have received a resounding message
from police officers and community members: Give preference to people
with LAPD experience and forget about race when picking the city's
top cop.</LD>
<LD>   "We have been talking to everybody, both inside and outside the
department," said panel member Ann Reiss Lane, a former member of the
Police Commission. "I think it would be very hard, particularly at
this time, for the rank-and-file to think about someone coming in
from the outside who doesn't know the department. They would have a
steep learning curve."</LD>
<LD>   Despite the acrimony that arose from the recent dismissal of
Bernard C. Parks, a popular figure in the city's African American
community, panel members are finding that people do not want the
process to be bogged down in politics over race, ethnicity, gender or
sexual preference.</LD>
<TE>   "Everyone, without exception, has said that those issues are
totally irrelevant," said panel member Jeff Donfeld, an attorney and
founding member of Chabad of Pacific Palisades. "Everyone says, 'We
want the best person; don't talk to me about race and religion.'
That's coming from blacks, Hispanics and Caucasians. They want the
best person."</TE>
<TE>   The Police Commission appointed the so-called blue-ribbon
committee last month to help develop the criteria for selecting the
LAPD's next leader.</TE>
<TE>   The 15-member panel, which includes a culturally and ethnically
diverse group of community members, has been interviewing people and
holding meetings to compile opinions about what qualities are needed
in a chief. It will continue its interviews in the next two weeks
before making final recommendations to the Police Commission.</TE>
<TE>   After that, Police Commission members will narrow the list and
begin interviewing top candidates. In early September, they plan to
give Mayor James K. Hahn their top three picks. Hahn will then select
the next chief, subject to City Council confirmation.</TE>
<TE>   Last week, city officials cut the field of applicants from more
than 50 to 21--eliminating people who did not have a bachelor's
degree or leadership experience in a law enforcement agency.</TE>
<TE>   The city began looking for its third chief in 10 years after the
Police Commission voted 4 to 1 in April to deny Parks' request for a
second five-year term. Parks was ousted, in part, because Hahn and
others did not think he had done enough to reduce crime, reform the
department and boost morale. The council upheld the commission's
decision.</TE>
<TE>   City officials have refused to disclose the list of candidates
seeking the position, but some candidates have made their intentions
public. They include Portland Police Chief Mark Kroeker; Oxnard
Police Chief Art Lopez; LAPD Deputy Chiefs David Kalish and David
Gascon; LAPD Cmdrs. George Gascon, Jim McDonnell, Sharon Papa and
Betty Kelepecz; Santa Ana Police Chief Paul Walters; and former New
York City Police Commissioner William Bratton.</TE>
<TE>   Former LAPD Chief Daryl Gates confirmed last week that he, too, is
seeking the position.</TE>
<TE>   "The department has been in a free fall for the past 10 years,"
Gates said. "Who better to right the ship than I?"</TE>
<TE>   Law enforcement sources also say John Timoney, the former head of
the Philadelphia Police Department, is interested in the position.
Timoney would not disclose, however, whether he applied for the job.</TE>
<TE>   The insider vs. outsider debate is a recurrent theme of Los
Angeles' recent police chief searches.</TE>
<TE>   Lane and others attribute the current concerns to bad feelings
dating back to Willie Williams' tenure as head of the department.
Williams was brought in from Philadelphia in 1992 to replace Gates
and never won over the department's rank-and-file. He was ousted
after one five-year term and replaced by Parks, an LAPD veteran.</TE>
<TE>   That sentiment against outsiders could spell trouble for Bratton,
who has spent his career working in police departments on the East
Coast, officials say.</TE>
<TE>   "It would be unwise to pick someone who doesn't understand the
realities and complexities of Los Angeles," said one panel member,
who asked not to be named. "I don't think we will end up recommending
that the mayor has to pick someone from the LAPD. But it certainly is
a value I would consider."</TE>
<TE>   Councilman Dennis Zine, a former director of Los Angeles Police
Protective League, said he wants a chief with West Coast law
enforcement experience.</TE>
<TE>   "It doesn't have to be someone specifically from the LAPD, but
someone who has that knowledge," Zine said. "I've been to the East
Coast, and it's a whole different mentality."</TE>
<TE>   For example, officers in Eastern cities are more likely to walk
their beats, while LAPD officers cover vast areas in their patrol
cars. "The training is different," Zine said.</TE>
<TE>   But other city officials said there could be benefit in selecting
an outsider--regardless of what part of the country the person is
from.</TE>
<TE>   "There definitely needs to be a strong change of culture from
within the LAPD," said Councilman Eric Garcetti. "If you bring in
someone who has been on the inside, can they shake it up? On the
other side of things, if it's an outside person, do they have the
ability to bring the organization along?"</TE>
<TE>   Bratton--who is well aware of the concerns--made a number of trips
to Los Angeles recently to show that he is familiar with the city and
with the problems facing the LAPD.</TE>
<TE>   In recent weeks, he has met with police officers, former members
of the Christopher Commission, and former police commissioners. He
points out the fact that he has spent a lot of time in Los Angeles in
the past year, working with an outside monitoring team tracking
reforms in the LAPD.</TE>
<TE>   "While an outsider, I have a familiarity with the institution,"
Bratton said.</TE>
<TE>   He has also sent out copies of his book--"Turnaround"--about his
tenure in the NYPD, where he is credited with dramatically cutting
the crime rate.</TE>
<TE>   Current and former members of the LAPD have tried a different
approach.</TE>
<TE>   For weeks, candidates Kroeker, Lopez and George Gascon have been
making the rounds at community group meetings.</TE>
<TE>   Recently, Gascon--a Latino--secured the endorsement of the Oscar
Joel Bryant Foundation, a group of black LAPD officers. The move, his
supporters say, shows that he is sensitive to all minority groups.</TE>
<TE>   Kroeker, meanwhile, has sought to fend off old criticism that,
while attending a religious conference 13 years ago, he made
disparaging remarks about gays.</TE>
<TE>   He said he has since "made a profound shift in my thinking and
understanding of gay and lesbian people."</TE>
<TE>   One thing is clear: The next chief must have an understanding of
all of Los Angeles' disparate communities, said panel member Donfeld.</TE>
<TE>   "There is an enormous amount of commonality that people want to
see in a police chief," Donfeld said. "They want a candidate who has
integrity, has great sense of fairness and experience at all levels
of policing. Most of all, they want someone who loves the city, who
can understand its diversity and adequately respond to its needs."</TE>

<HD>Disposal of DNA Leads to Review</HD>
<DH>Policy: Rape survivors and police rethink limit for keeping
evidence.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The revelation that the Los Angeles Police Department mistakenly
destroyed evidence in 1,000 unsolved rape cases has ignited a debate
about when, if ever, DNA evidence should be thrown out.</LD>
<LD>   The disclosure has triggered discussion in the Los Angeles City
Council, the Police Commission and among prosecutors, police and
victims such as Patti Lancaster.</LD>
<LD>   Ten years after she was raped at knifepoint, the slightest whiff
of a certain men's cologne--the kind her attacker wore--brings back
horrible memories.</LD>
<TE>   Santa Monica authorities closed her case in 1998 without an arrest
when the legal deadline for prosecution had passed.</TE>
<TE>   She was unhappy to learn that police policy allowed disposal of
the evidence, which meant Lancaster might never know if the rapist
got caught or whether he is still lurking about.</TE>
<TE>   "That DNA evidence is like the rapist writing his name on a piece
of paper and sticking it on the victim," said Lancaster, 47, a
producer of television commercials. "It's right there. Why would you
ever get rid of it?"</TE>
<TE>   A Santa Monica police spokesman acknowledged that the department,
like others in Los Angeles County, allows disposal of biological
evidence when the statute of limitations expires. When investigations
turn up no suspects, that legal time limit almost always expires
before criminalists can find time to analyze the DNA.</TE>
<TE>   New techniques for analyzing biological evidence and the
collection of tens of thousands of genetic profiles have made DNA
analysis the most valuable criminal investigative tool to emerge in
decades, top law enforcement officials say.</TE>
<TE>   Now such advances mean DNA can solve the oldest of cases, clear
the wrongly convicted and bring relief to victims in rape cases that
have been closed without being solved, many criminalists and women's
advocates say.</TE>
<TE>   "Rapists repeat their crimes more than murderers do," said Karen
Pomer, a rape survivor and founding member of Rainbow Sisters. "DNA
gives you the chance to stop them."</TE>
<TE>   Laura Johnson, administrator of the LAPD Support Services
Division, said the department's "policies and procedures have not
kept up with the technology."</TE>
<TE>   Johnson headed the inquiry into the discarded evidence, called
rape test kits. She said the study found that many detectives
approved the destruction of biological evidence because they were
unaware that the six-year statute of limitations had been extended as
of Jan. 1, 2001. Some detectives decided the evidence was no longer
needed for other reasons, such as the victim deciding not to
prosecute.</TE>
<TE>   "They should not be destroying the evidence in these cases [before
the statute of limitations]," Johnson said.</TE>
<TE>   The policy is under review. "That's something we're discussing
with the city attorney," she said.</TE>
<TE>   LAPD Cmdr. Harlan Ward, head of the Detective Services Group, said
the department may eventually decide to preserve all biological
evidence.</TE>
<TE>   "I would agree that we may be headed to where we will be holding
everything," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles County Dist. Atty. Steve Cooley, who has sparred with
the LAPD over providing more resources to exploit DNA evidence, said
that agency isn't the only one lagging.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think anyone in the Los Angeles County law enforcement
community has done enough to take advantage of the advances in DNA
science," he said. "It's developed so fast, and we are far from being
on the cutting edge."</TE>
<TE>   With only a handful of criminalists and 60 to 80 new DNA requests
coming in monthly, the crime labs focus primarily on cases heading
for trial.</TE>
<TE>   As a result, the LAPD and the Los Angeles County Sheriff's
Department have reported a combined backlog of about 2,200 untested
sexual assault kits, which are 5-by-7-inch envelopes containing swabs
of body fluids obtained from the victim.</TE>
<TE>   Cooley has said the planned $96-million regional crime lab, which
will house the police and sheriff's forensic laboratories, will not
solve the problem. He contends the LAPD's plan doesn't provide enough
space for its DNA unit.</TE>
<TE>   For now, no biological evidence is being destroyed. The uproar
over the destroyed rape kits prompted the LAPD to declare a
moratorium. And the Sheriff's Department, which does lab work for
itself and cities other than Los Angeles, imposed a moratorium in
November 2000, according to Peter Zavalo, head of the property and
evidence unit.</TE>
<TE>   The LAPD evidence controversy also spurred the Sheriff's
Department to launch a study of its own unsolved sex offense cases.
Dan Scott, operations sergeant in the family crimes unit, said he is
reviewing a sample of 350 cases to determine whether rape kits have
been destroyed "when they shouldn't have been."</TE>
<TE>   Both departments also are reviewing training programs and criteria
used in deciding whether evidence should be saved or tossed.
Currently, neither agency has written criteria.</TE>
<TE>   Both departments rely heavily on individual investigators'
judgments, and they follow similar procedures for collecting, storing
and retrieving evidence. The movement of rape kits among crime labs,
property rooms, clerical personnel, detectives and prosecutors is
painstakingly documented.</TE>
<TE>   In the Sheriff's Department, detectives, in writing their initial
crime report, assign evidence a "retention" number, which usually
refers to the length of the statute of limitations.</TE>
<TE>   About every six months, personnel in the department's property and
evidence unit in Whittier ask for instructions on what to do with the
evidence. The unit has three 20-by-40-foot freezers where biological
evidence is stored and will soon have a fourth.</TE>
<TE>   Detectives tell the property room to save the evidence or destroy
it. They are not required to give any explanation for their choice,
Zavalo said.</TE>
<TE>   "The case investigator is responsible, because they should be, and
are, aware of what's going on with the case," he said.</TE>
<TE>   At the LAPD, a supervisor must approve a detective's decision,
Ward said.</TE>
<TE>   The authorization is given monthly on a "disposition summary"
document that detectives receive from the property and evidence unit.
Ward said that whoever approves the disposal of evidence is expected
to review the case file or consult with any former detective assigned
to it before authorizing disposal.</TE>
<TE>   Johnson, the support services administrator, said unneeded
evidence has to be thrown away periodically to save space.</TE>
<TE>   "We definitely have space problems," she said. The property room,
which is on Ramirez Street, will soon add about 2,000 square feet of
freezer space to the 3,000 it already has. Even with that, she
expects the unit to run out of space before the end of the year if
the moratorium continues.</TE>
<TE>   The California Department of Justice maintains two computer
databases of DNA evidence, one with more than 224,000 DNA profiles of
people convicted of sexual offenses, domestic assault, certain
robberies and other crimes. Although the database was established in
1994, it didn't become large enough to be useful until about 18
months ago, according Frank Fitzpatrick, director of forensic
services for the Orange County Sheriff's Department.</TE>
<TE>   The state also maintains a database of DNA material collected from
unsolved sex offenses. The two databases permit investigators to
cross-check DNA profiles in unsolved rapes with the profiles in the
database of criminals.</TE>
<TE>   As the number of DNA profiles in the databases increases,
detectives have a greater chance of finding rapists. That's why the
new statute of limitations law that went into effect in 2001 is so
important, experts say.</TE>
<TE>   At the very least, the law extends the time limit from six years
to 10. It allows the investigation to continue without any deadline
for sex offenses committed after Jan. 1, 2001, if the DNA is analyzed
within two years of the offense.</TE>
<TE>   For crimes committed before 2001, the biological evidence must be
analyzed before 2004 to put the statute of limitations on hold.</TE>
<TE>   The statutory clock will not start ticking again until the DNA has
been conclusively matched with a suspect, at which time authorities
have one year to begin prosecution.</TE>
<TE>   Rape survivors say the new law, combined with rapid scientific
advances, has made the destruction of biological evidence and the
huge backlogs especially egregious. For them, it means law
enforcement has frittered away opportunities to solve cases and stop
countless other sex offenses.</TE>
<TE>   The Rainbow Sisters will hold a "DNA Awareness March and Rally For
Public Safety" in front of Los Angeles police headquarters at Parker
Center to, among other things, protest the destruction of rape kits.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a core safety issue," said Jeri Elster, a rape survivor
and member of the group.</TE>
<TE>   Even if a rape kit cannot be used to prosecute the case for which
it was meant, the DNA profile could help stop the rapist if he is
charged with a subsequent offense, said Lisa Kahn, a prosecutor who
heads the Los Angeles County district attorney's forensic science
unit.</TE>
<TE>   "It can be used as corroborative information," she said.</TE>
<TE>   More than that, Kahn added, rape survivors need to know if their
attacker has been caught.</TE>
<TE>   "From a purely humanistic view point," Kahn said, "if you can
someday tell a victim, 'Hey, we've caught the guy, we're prosecuting
him, and we're going to put him away for a long time,' it gives them
some relief."</TE>
<TE>   Patti Lancaster, the 1992 rape survivor, agrees. "To know he is in
prison would make me feel fabulous," she said.</TE>
<TE>   "Just this morning on the set [for a commercial shoot], one of our
people had the cologne that was so similar to his," she said,
referring to the rapist.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a reminder of the incident," she said. "That he's still
out there. That it can happen again."</TE>

<DL>LODI</DL>
<LD>After more than a century of quiet rural existence, this small
Central Valley farm town finds itself surrounded.</LD>
<LD>   Just up California 99, the 2-year-old city of Elk Grove has
swollen to 80,000 residents. To the south, the burgeoning community
of Stockton has crept to within four miles of Lodi's border. To the
southwest, Bay Area commuters have doubled Tracy's population in the
last decade.</LD>
<LD>   In this tiny corner of Old California, where agriculture was once
king, talk of the newest suburban incursion now mixes with
conversation about the latest grape harvest. And people in Lodi are
finding their country-hewn libertarianism colliding with a desire for
government to help preserve their way of life.</LD>
<TE>   "The dirt in this valley is sacred," said Lodi farmer David
Phillips, whose family has been tilling the sandy loam soil for five
generations. "It feeds the world. To cover it up with strip malls and
poorly planned tract developments--well, something needs to be done."</TE>
<TE>   Lodi is caught in the same pincers bearing down on many rural
California communities. Once-prized agricultural fields are more
valuable as new housing lots. And former city dwellers are jumping at
the chance to buy spacious homes with large yards at a fraction of
the cost of urban real estate.</TE>
<TE>   Decades ago, the same push of development felled the citrus trees
of Southern California. Later, subdivisions and technology firms
overtook the prune orchards of the Silicon Valley.</TE>
<TE>   But Lodi, the heart of California's wine grape industry, is
resisting the suburban onslaught. The 11-square-mile town of 60,000
people has a strict 2% annual growth rate limit and deeply rooted
objections to turning farmland into suburbia.</TE>
<TE>   "You start pulling out grapevines around here, and you're
considered a terrorist," said Tony Goehring, the town's economic
development coordinator.</TE>
<TE>   Sprawl is the No. 1 political issue in Lodi--but one that people
say they have heard little about from the two major party candidates
for governor.</TE>
<TE>   Folks in Lodi trend conservative, and most say for that reason,
they'll vote for Republican gubernatorial nominee Bill Simon Jr. in
November. Few can cite what he stands for, but they say he's better
than the alternative.</TE>
<TE>   "Gov. Davis hasn't shown any initiative or any desire to help our
situation here," said 79-year-old Ed Olson, owner of Robinson's Feed
and Farm Supply, where the air is laden with the musty smell of
leather cowboy boots. "Maybe Simon, being more conservative, would do
something."</TE>
<TE>   All the same, Lodi residents said they would like to hear someone
address their worries about the air pollution drifting in from the
Bay Area, the economic difficulty of surviving as a farmer, and the
neighboring cities encroaching on local vineyards.</TE>
<TE>   The conflict between Lodi's agricultural past and its developing
present is evident on a drive through town.</TE>
<TE>   Hand-lettered signs advertising "Fresh strawberries ahead" hang on
telephone poles near ubiquitous chain stores like Staples and
Wal-Mart. Stucco subdivisions press up against fields of gangly
grapevines. And in February, Lodi got its first Starbucks.</TE>
<TE>   Anxiety is just as present. Over in the Pine Street Pub, which
claims "the coldest beer in town," Gary Smith complained on a recent
afternoon that he pays only $20 less in rent here than he did for a
two-bedroom apartment in Agoura Hills five years ago.</TE>
<TE>   "That's why I came up here," the 38-year-old bartender said. "I
thought that I would have a better standard of living."</TE>
<TE>   At the Phillips Farm roadside cafe, a dozen elderly women wearing
fanciful red hats and purple blouses bemoaned what is bearing down on
their town.</TE>
<TE>   "Why, look what's happened in Elk Grove and Galt," clucked
78-year-old Boots Barber, whose Red Hat Society meets for lunch once
a month. "There are too many people and too much traffic."</TE>
<TE>   Over at Tillie's, a sandwich shop down the street from City Hall,
Diane Tonn is worried that Lodi will lose its small-town quality.</TE>
<TE>   "I just don't want to see all the farmland between here and
Stockton and here and Sacramento taken up with housing," said the
61-year-old bridal shop employee. "I don't want it to be one big
city."</TE>
<TE>   That's the Phillips brothers' worst fear. Their family helped
shape Lodi. Their paternal grandfather laid the sidewalks downtown,
while their mother's family grew the giant watermelons that made Lodi
famous at the turn of the century.</TE>
<TE>   If development continues, the Phillipses said, Lodi will blend
right into all the other nearby towns.</TE>
<TE>   "It would lose its distinctiveness, the ag feeling," said Michael
Phillips, David's older brother. "And if we lose that, it's gone
forever--like L.A. and Orange County and San Jose."</TE>
<TE>   No one is sure how to stop the sprawl. Farmers like the Phillips
brothers are not eager to welcome government intrusion in their
affairs.</TE>
<TE>   "Farmers just want to make their living, be good stewards of the
land and keep the government out of our lives as much as possible,"
David Phillips said.</TE>
<TE>   But the fear that agricultural land will be paved has prodded many
to look to government for a solution. Many locals would like to see a
repeal of the inheritance tax, which they say unfairly burdens the
children of farmers, and other financial incentives for farmers to
keep farming.</TE>
<TE>   Michael Phillips said he hopes that if Simon wins, he will do
something to protect agriculture.</TE>
<TE>   "In general, Republicans are more farm-friendly, I think," he
said. "We definitely could use the governor's support to limit some
of that growth."</TE>
<TE>   For now, however, Lodi politicians are stuck with immediate
development conflicts.</TE>
<TE>   The most urgent issue is to the south, where Stockton, four times
the size of Lodi, has been insistently annexing unincorporated county
land. The city's northern city limit now reaches Eight Mile
Road--practically bumping into the backyard of its smaller neighbor.</TE>
<TE>   "If this had been 500 years ago, there probably would have been a
war," joked Lodi City Manager H. Dixon Flynn.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, the town is trying to create a buffer zone between the
two communities--setting aside 15,000 acres of open space and
farmland that will be protected from development. Talks about the
greenbelt have stretched on for three years, and recently Stockton
slowed the process further by insisting that the issue be studied
countywide.</TE>
<TE>   There's no guarantee that everyone in Lodi will back the concept,
either. Though many farmers in the area say they need the greenbelt,
some chafe at the thought of the government legislating what they can
do with their land.</TE>
<TE>   Jerry Fry said he is tired of finding joggers in his vineyard when
he's about to spray the crops, and of teenagers riding their
motorcycles through his cherry orchards. But nonetheless, he is
nervous about losing control of his land if his 280-acre farm becomes
part of the buffer zone.</TE>
<TE>   "Our family has been farming since 1855, so that's the direction
that at this time we hope to keep going in," Fry said. "But you don't
know what other things can affect you. How do we know in 30 years we
can still raise grapes here and compete with the rest of the world?"</TE>
<TE>   With that in mind, many farmers in the Lodi area are trying to
dictate their own destiny by introducing a new industry to the area:
agritourism.</TE>
<TE>   The 75,000 acres of vineyards surrounding Lodi produce more grapes
than Sonoma and Napa combined, and 37 local wineries now make more
than 100 vintages with Lodi labels. Two years ago, the local wine
grape commission built a visitors center to showcase the industry,
next door to a newly renovated bed and breakfast.</TE>
<TE>   "We want people to think about [the wine industry] when they see
the land beginning to clear for another housing development," said
Mark Chandler, executive director of the commission.</TE>
<TE>   Winemaker David Lucas, whose self-named winery was the first
boutique to put Lodi on its label, believes the town can become "the
Carmel of the Central Valley." But the government needs to help
preserve agricultural space, he said, by giving farmers financial
incentives to sell to other farmers instead of developers.</TE>
<TE>   "Agricultural land should be looked at in the same light as our
national parks," Lucas said.</TE>
<TE>   Lodi officials are trying to carve out a middle path, hoping to
allow just enough development to keep the local economy strong. A few
new companies are making their home in Lodi, including a hot dog and
sausage plant. The town recently invested $25 million to revitalize
its downtown, adding a 12-screen movie theater and Lodi's first
parking structure.</TE>
<TE>   But it is a constant struggle to balance economic growth with
self-preservation. Many locals view the imminent arrival of a Lowe's
Home Improvement Warehouse as another sign that Lodi is morphing into
Anytown, USA. The ambivalence toward development affects even the
newer residents, who echo the worries of old-timers that the town
they love is changing, its fate out of their hands.</TE>
<TE>   Zsa-Zsa Nunez moved to Lodi when she was 7 after her mother left
San Jose for the quiet refuge of the country. She lives in one of the
new subdivisions, and enjoys Lodi's new stores and movie theater. But
she fears that, inevitably, development will draw the urban problems
she left behind.</TE>
<TE>   "We used to fall asleep in San Jose to the sound of sirens," said
the 19-year-old, sipping a white chocolate mocha outside the new
Starbucks on a recent afternoon. "When we came to Lodi, we had to get
used to the silence. But now that it's expanding, everything is going
to change.'</TE>

<HD>Newport Beach Culture Runs on Juice and Harbor's Silent
Duffys</HD>

<LD>I was on the trail of professional goofball Dennis Rodman one night
in Newport Beach, chatting with a bartender about the former
basketball player's frequent dust-ups, when I noticed a floating
party pull into the docks out back of the restaurant.</LD>
<LD>   Several people who appeared to be having the time of their lives
disembarked and came in for a drink. Later, when the boat departed,
some passengers stayed behind and others took their place.</LD>
<LD>   By then I'd lost interest in Rodman. I went out to the dock and
watched the boat tie up at the next bar down the channel, where the
scene was repeated. And I knew this was the life for me.</LD>
<TE>   The Newport Beach tradition of bar-hopping by boat goes back
decades, and a man named Marshall "Duffy" Duffield is at the center
of it. More than 30 years ago, Duffy was a teenager who putted around
the harbor in his dad's little motorboat, often impressing young
ladies with his navigational skills.</TE>
<TE>   When the gas-powered motor conked out on him one day, Duffy
eyeballed an electric golf cart and wondered why you couldn't make a
boat run on a battery, too. After some tinkering, he had invented an
electric boat, now known simply as the Duffy.</TE>
<TE>   It's the perfect Newport harbor boat because it goes just 5 mph,
which happens to be the speed limit. It's so quiet, you can pull up
alongside other boaters and trade offshore tax shelter information.
And it's small enough that you can maneuver into a restaurant dock
with a margarita in one hand.</TE>
<TE>   Marshall Duffield didn't just invent a boat, he invented a
culture.</TE>
<TE>   "We've sold over 1,000 of them, just in Newport alone," says
Duffy, who tells me there are trust-fund babies out there who aren't
known to have done anything in decades other than cruise the bay. "On
a weekend, you can walk across the harbor, going from one Duffy boat
to another."</TE>
<TE>   Duffy kindly prepared a list of seven universally acknowledged
kings of the Duffy scene. Scott Sarkisian, one of the first I called,
said to meet him at his slip on Balboa Island at 5 o'clock sharp,
cocktail hour on the bay.</TE>
<TE>   Sarkisian, who owns a metal-refinishing business, arrived with
liquid refreshment and a platter of sushi and cracked crab from the
Bluewater Grill. His boat is tied up at a friend's weekend home,
which Sarkisian uses as a $4.5-million ice chest. He popped in for
some ice cubes because, on a Duffy, you don't want to be without a
cocktail between bars.</TE>
<TE>   Sarkisian, nattily attired in shorts and ruby-red loafers, hit the
switch on his 16-foot Duffy Electric--which has a mesh top to filter
the setting sun--and we were on our way.</TE>
<TE>   "This is the best way to end a day," he said, a claim that could
not be argued against. The water was flat and the sky low, shorebirds
skimming a soft horizon. "If you want a stress reducer, this is it."</TE>
<TE>   My pilot was no ordinary helmsman. Sarkisian, a charming kibitzer
known by some as the mayor of the harbor, is a three-time winner of
the Great Duffy Electric Boat Race, a combination treasure hunt and
rally held each June. This year, his team drubbed a field of 57 other
crews, because Sarkisian knows intimately the miles of waterways
around Balboa, Newport, Harbor, Lido and Bay Islands.</TE>
<TE>   The on-board bar was open as we veered out of the South Bayfront
neighborhood and into the Turning Basin and Main Channel.</TE>
<TE>   "You can toss the shrimp tails into the water," Sarkisian advised,
enjoying a Mount Gay rum on the rocks. "They're biodegradable."</TE>
<TE>   Unless you're driving into bridge supports or falling out of the
boat, harbor police don't bother busting these floating cocktail
parties. There are so many of them, they'd need backup from the Navy
and the National Guard.</TE>
<TE>   "I could point out the homes of all my girlfriends and
ex-fiancees," offered Sarkisian, who is single at 51. The Duffy makes
a great first date, he says, because it serves as an icebreaker. From
a bar, you can point out to the dock at your carriage and say, "Let's
go for a boat ride."</TE>
<TE>   You can kill a couple of hours on the water just wondering whether
you slept late the day all these other folks figured out how to buy
$10-million weekend homes and yachts the size of hotels.</TE>
<TE>   "That used to be John Wayne's house," Sarkisian said, pointing to
a nice little spread at the water's edge.</TE>
<TE>   Other Duffys were out on the water now with their little canopy
tops, cutting small wakes across the slow-motion universe. One boat
was done up in a Polynesian theme, with hula girl cutouts glued to
the craft. The passengers wore Hawaiian shirts, which are very, very
big in Newport. Almost as big as white duck pants and early-bird
specials.</TE>
<TE>   There's a tradition of giving Duffy boats names with an electrical
reference, and the Polynesian affair was called Teenie Wattheenie.
Sarkisian, who has a lone hula girl planted on the bow of his cabin,
pilots Schock-Ah.</TE>
<TE>   "We're going to go pick up a couple of friends of mine," he said
as we headed for the Newport Boulevard Bridge and Balboa Coves, where
Marco and Gale Baljeu live. He called them on his cell phone, and
they came through the back of their house and walked down to the dock
with some cold beer.</TE>
<TE>   This is how you get together with friends in Newport. They hop
into your boat and you have a drink on the way to Billy's at the
Beach, the Cannery, the Bluewater Grill, the Rusty Pelican, the Elks
Lodge or the American Legion hall, among other joints with a place to
tie up.</TE>
<TE>   As we floated through narrow waterways, under bridges, and past
hundreds of backyards, Sarkisian and the Baljeus knew virtually
everyone, whether they saw them on their back deck or called out to
them in another Duffy.</TE>
<TE>   It was the antithesis, it struck me, of Southern California
living.</TE>
<TE>   No cars. Lots of mingling. And everyone knows everyone else.</TE>
<TE>   "It's like having a floating living room," said Marco, and your
neighbors are always dropping in unannounced.</TE>
<TE>   We had a pop at Billy's, where the Teenie Wattheenie crew was
dining, and then cruised over to the Bluewater for dinner, passing
fleets of Duffy Electrics along the way.</TE>
<TE>   "Where you guys going?" Sarkisian called out to a boatload of
friends.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't know," they called back.</TE>
<TE>   Every week, they hang a sign at Duffy's store on the Coast
Highway, paying tribute to the best boat name of the week.</TE>
<TE>   All-time greats include Bay Watts, Circuit de Soleil, Cutty Spark,
Raging Watters, Salt N Battery, Sherlock Ohms, Shock Cousteau, Socket
To Me, and Voltswagon.</TE>
<TE>   And then there's this one, which sums it all up:</TE>

<HD>Home of Surfing More Than Surfers</HD>
<DH>Trends: Huntington Beach, once a haven for the wave set,
remakes itself and rents soar.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID REYES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Along Pacific Coast Highway, a new hotel tower rises along the
shoreline, offering $300-a-night suites with dramatic views of the
ocean and Catalina Island. Down Huntington Beach's Main Street, many
of the tattoo parlors and dive bars have been replaced with elegant
bistros and sidewalk cafes.</LD>
<LD>   This is the new "Surf City U.S.A.," the product of a decade-long
revitalization effort that has transformed a beachside district more
associated with July 4th melees than elegant dining.</LD>
<LD>   But some surfers are feeling left out.</LD>
<TE>   They miss the mom-and-pop surf shops that have closed down, along
with famous hangouts like the old Surf Theater, where a generation
ago pioneering filmmakers like Bud Browne showed their surfing
footage from around the world.</TE>
<TE>   Surfers complain about being priced out of town by soaring
apartment rents. Even the Huntington Beach International Surfing
Museum is searching for new quarters because its landlord--the
city--is selling the building it occupies, which will put the new
rental rate out of the museum's reach.</TE>
<TE>   Bud Llamas, the famed surfer whose name is chiseled prominently on
the city's Surfing Walk of Fame, laments the changes.</TE>
<TE>   "My name is down there, yet I can't afford property in this city,"
said Llamas, 40. "I rent a room."</TE>
<TE>   But more than resenting the new affluence, old-timers like Llamas
miss the gritty, fun-loving atmosphere they said made the old
Huntington Beach distinctive.</TE>
<TE>   "They can put a different face on it and make it look like every
other beach city, but I think they're shooting their own foot," said
Rebecca Pilette, whose family has owned a liquor store on Pacific
Coast Highway for 30 years. "It's like they're trying to get the
upscale South Coast Plaza crowd in here and, basically, this is a
beach town and always will be a beach town."</TE>
<TE>   Huntington Beach takes great pride in its association with
surfing. It fought with Santa Cruz for the title "Surf City U.S.A.,"
and a dictionary on surfing defines "Surf City" as "another name for
Huntington Beach, Calif."</TE>
<TE>   City officials dismiss the criticism of their new downtown,
pointing out that the new businesses have generated tax dollars used
to benefit surfers, from fixing leaking sewers that could pollute the
ocean to building new beach restrooms and showers. They believe the
criticism is coming mostly from older surfers sad to see their haunts
disappear and unhappy about the influx of younger surfers--and
spectators.</TE>
<TE>   "Granted, there is a group of surfers in their 40s and 50s, the
ones with the attitude that they don't need any new surfers coming in
here, and they chase away the younger ones," said Ron Hagan, city
director of community services. "But they're not our future. Our
future is the Generation X, the younger ones, who are making surfing
a lifestyle sport."</TE>
<TE>   Huntington Beach has been one of the world's surfing capitals
since the 1920s, when Hawaiian Duke Kahanamoku, "the father of
surfing," rode the waves around the City Pier.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. Surf championships have been held in the city for decades,
making it a venue for early standouts such as Joyce Hoffman, David
Nuuhiwa and Corky Carroll. By the early 1960s, Huntington Beach was a
mecca for would-be surfers from around the country.</TE>
<TE>   The city's downtown always had a decidedly working-class feel, a
place where surfers could rent a cheap apartment and still have money
left to hit nightspots such as the Golden Bear and Main Street
Saloon. Laguna Beach had the arts scene and Malibu had the Hollywood
luster, but Huntington Beach was a blue-collar haven.</TE>
<TE>   But by the late 1980s, crime was on the rise and many in the city
believed the downtown was in need of a face lift. Shopping centers
and multiplex movie theaters have replaced some of the older
buildings and motels. A 500-room Hyatt hotel resort will open in
2003, joining the Waterfront Hilton across from the pier.</TE>
<TE>   City officials said the crowds that line Main Street at night and
on weekends attest to the success of their effort. But they insist
it's not been at the expense of longtime surfers.</TE>
<TE>   Officials point out that the city still organizes amateur surfing
contests, surf classes for youngsters and waives parking fees for
high school surf teams.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, the recent U.S. Open of Surfing drew 200,000 people to
Huntington Beach last month.</TE>
<TE>   "There's plenty of room for today's surfers. Maybe the buildings
have changed, but the beach hasn't," said Rich Barnard, a city
spokesman. "I don't agree with the idea that somehow buildings have a
negative impact on something or on the way it used to be. I think
we've increased the awareness of surfing."</TE>
<TE>   But some surfers say the changes have come at their expense.
Skyrocketing home prices and rents are making it harder for young
surfers trying for a pro career to live near the beach.</TE>
<TE>   Kris Camacho, at 23, is an up-and-coming professional surfer. But
his earnings on the pro circuit--about $40,000 a year--barely cover
rent and travel. So he moonlights busing tables and as a DJ. His
biggest gripe about the new Huntington Beach is the crowds it has
brought to the waters.</TE>
<TE>   "All this building just brings in more people, and there's already
enough here and in the water. The best surf breaks are already
crowded," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Surf historian and promoter Allan Seymour said the situation
reminds him of a quote by Bill Veeck, former owner of the Chicago
White Sox. "He said that the true fans are sitting in the worst
seats. Those in the corporate seats are talking business while the
real fans are charting pitches in the nosebleed seats."</TE>
<TE>   "That's what's happened to Huntington Beach," Seymour says. "It's
become a venue."</TE>
<TE>   James Lane, who has lived in Huntington Beach for 46 years, says
the "Surf City U.S.A." title is now being used by the city mainly as
a marketing tool to draw diners and tourists to Huntington Beach.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a dichotomy because you're trying to sell one lifestyle--but
not selling it to surfers but to millionaires who can afford to buy
property around here," said Lane, who successfully fought the city's
attempt to take his downtown property by eminent domain.</TE>
<TE>   Other surfers are more resigned, saying the kind of community
surfers crave is gone.</TE>
<TE>   "It would be nice to turn back the clock and surf uncrowded breaks
like the ranch north of Santa Barbara or Malibu the way it was in the
old days," said Bob Bolen, 59, who in the 1970s owned the Greek, a
famed surfboard shop. "But you have to keep up with change.... We're
not that sleepy little beach city anymore."</TE>

<LD>Just as an engine loaded with horsepower can't deliver with clogged
fuel injectors, the bevy of talented Spark players wouldn't mean a
thing if the Sparks couldn't get them the ball.</LD>
<LD>   The Sparks are winning games again, winning when it matters most,
because they always seem to get the ball to the right place at the
right time.</LD>
<LD>   They finished off the Seattle Storm, 69-59, Saturday at Staples
Center to complete a two-game sweep in the first round of the
playoffs.</LD>
<TE>   They did it even though top scorer Mwadi Mabika didn't have
it--and the Sparks didn't have her for a while after she went out
with a sprained ankle in the second half.</TE>
<TE>   They did it even though Lisa Leslie, who edged Mabika by a tenth
of a point in scoring average this season, didn't get a point in the
final 3 1/2 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   They did it because, sooner or later, they're going to find
someone who can beat you. In this case, it was Tamecka Dixon coming
on to score seven of her 15 points in the final 1:46.</TE>
<TE>   "They have so many weapons," Seattle Coach Lin Dunn said.</TE>
<TE>   "We've always had those weapons, it's just a matter of us working
it into our game plan," Spark forward Delisha Milton said. "We're
playing smart basketball now, from the coaches on down to the players
on the court."</TE>
<TE>   They manage to get the ball to Leslie even though she's the focal
point of every defense. They also use her as a decoy effectively.
They can swing the ball to the outside, but more importantly they can
work the ball inside.</TE>
<TE>   Their ball movement can be beautiful to watch. Take the first-half
play when four Sparks combined to give L.A. its first lead. Mabika
drove the right side and passed out to Dixon. Dixon found point guard
Nikki Teasley at the top of the key, and she hit Mabika on the left
side of the hoop. Mabika went up, drew two defenders and dropped the
ball off to Leslie for an open layup.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier in the season, the passes weren't as crisp. Even when they
found the right person, they wouldn't hit her in the right place,
with the ball coming in too high or too low to allow a quick and easy
shot.</TE>
<TE>   The Sparks corrected that the hard way, with sweat and aching
muscles. During the course of practice, the coaches kept track of how
many bad passes they made, and that would dictate the number of 17s
they had to run. Seventeens are 17 sprints from sideline to sideline,
to be completed in anywhere from 45 to 90 seconds depending on Coach
Michael Cooper's mood.</TE>
<TE>   "Those hurt bad," Milton said.</TE>
<TE>   They're getting the payoff in playoff victories. It's not just
execution, it's attitude.</TE>
<TE>   "No one's selfish here," Dixon said. "I think that's the biggest
key to our team. No one cares who gets the two points.</TE>
<TE>   "We just try to let the ball find the open player. We're very
talented and can score from every position. Even when we bring
players in off the bench, those are players that could start on any
other team."</TE>
<TE>   Or start for the Storm, at least, the way the Sparks have been
talking about them.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier in the week, Milton described Seattle as "a team that's
full of a lot of players that would likely not be in the league if
that team wasn't in existence."</TE>
<TE>   Saturday, Teasley didn't sound too impressed by Seattle All-Star
point guard Sue Bird.</TE>
<TE>   "Sue Bird is the same as any other player," Teasley said. "They
set a lot of screens on her and that is how she gets her plays. She
can't break anyone down one-on-one, they just set a lot of screens
for her and do a lot for her and that is what makes her who she is."</TE>
<TE>   Well, Bird is a player who has great anticipation on defense, can
get to the basket quickly and made the open shot.</TE>
<TE>   But Saturday Dixon got the better of her in the last two minutes
after she took over at the point for the Sparks. With Mabika shooting
three for 14, Leslie had carried the Sparks for much of the game.
Leslie had 17 of the team's 33 first-half points and 21 of their
first 50. But she faltered down the stretch, making only one of her
last five shots. That's where Dixon came in.</TE>
<TE>   After the Storm sliced a 15-point Spark lead to two, Dixon drove
down the middle, made a layup and was fouled for the three-point
play. Forty-five seconds later, she went baseline for another bucket.
She tacked on two free throws in the final minute to give the Sparks
their final cushion.</TE>
<TE>   "We needed somebody from a guard position to step up and be a
leader," Dixon said. "We've got a point guard who's a rookie. When
you have that she's going to make some mistakes.</TE>
<TE>   "In any situation, especially a playoff situation like this, you
want your veterans to step up and take charge."</TE>
<TE>   Dixon is a huge fan of "The Sopranos," and she's fired up because
the DVD collection of the third season is coming out Aug. 27, with
new episodes hitting HBO in September. A picture of Tony Soprano's
crew hangs above her locker, with the boys looking as tough as ever.</TE>
<TE>   You know what? The Sparks have a pretty impressive lineup
themselves.</TE>

<HD>A's Get Offensive and Defeat White Sox, 9-2</HD>

<LD>Art Howe knew the Chicago White Sox probably weren't throwing at
Miguel Tejada. The Oakland manager also knew he'd probably get
ejected if the Athletics responded.</LD>
<LD>   Still, Howe was glad Jim Mecir sent a message.</LD>
<LD>   "If you can't pitch inside, don't try," Howe said.</LD>
<TE>   Mark Ellis hit a three-run homer and Tejada drove in his 100th run
as the A's defeated the White Sox, 9-2, Saturday at Oakland. It was
the A's fourth victory in a row.</TE>
<TE>   Oakland had a comfortable victory in hand by the time reliever
Damaso Marte hit Tejada on the elbow in the eighth inning. In the
third, Jon Garland's 1-2 pitch accidentally glanced off Tejada's
batting helmet.</TE>
<TE>   The White Sox probably weren't going after the A's All-Star
shortstop, who drove in two runs with a single and an groundout. But
Mecir still hit shortstop Royce Clayton on the leg with two outs in
the ninth, leading to ejections for Mecir and Howe.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know, you'd have to ask them," Howe responded when asked
if the White Sox were throwing at Tejada. "Miggy's been getting hit
quite a bit lately. It's got to stop."</TE>
<TE>   Tejada moved past Chicago's Magglio Ordonez, who has 99 runs
batted in, for second place in the league behind Alex Rodriguez. It's
the third consecutive 100-RBI season for Tejada.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think they're scared of me or something," Tejada said. "I
don't think they tried to hit me. I don't show off or do anything
stupid."</TE>
<TE>   After Marte hit Tejada, home plate umpire Rob Drake warned both
benches--but Howe didn't see the warning.</TE>
<TE>   "We weren't trying to hit anybody, but at the same time, it's just
baseball," Chicago Manager Jerry Manuel said. "They had to do what
they had to do to protect their guys."</TE>
<TE>   Mark Mulder (14-7) pitched eight innings of five-hit ball for his
third victory in four starts. He got a wealth of run support from the
A's, who pounded Garland (8-9) and reliever Rocky Biddle for eight
runs in the first four innings.</TE>
<TE>   Boston 5, Minnesota 2--Knuckleballer Tim Wakefield frustrated the
Twins for six innings, giving up only four hits at Minneapolis.</TE>
<TE>   Wakefield (7-4), who also gave up four hits in his last outing
against the Twins, walked three and struck out four to send Minnesota
to its ninth loss in 12 games.</TE>
<TE>   Alan Embree pitched the Red Sox out of a bases-loaded jam with the
score 3-1 in the seventh to help secure the victory.</TE>
<TE>   After Wakefield walked Doug Mientkiewicz, loading the bases in the
seventh, reliever Bob Howry walked in a run. But Embree came in and
struck out A.J. Pierzynski, Luis Rivas and Bobby Kielty.</TE>
<TE>   Baltimore 7, Detroit 3--Mike Bordick celebrated his return from
the disabled list by singling in the tiebreaking run in the seventh
inning at Camden Yards and John Stephens earned his first major
league victory.</TE>
<TE>   Marty Cordova had three hits and two RBIs for the Orioles, who
trailed, 3-1, before sending nine men to the plate during a four-run
seventh. They got five hits in the seventh against Mark Redman (7-11)
and two relievers.</TE>
<TE>   Kansas City 7, Tampa Bay 3--Brent Mayne hit a tying home run with
two outs in the ninth inning and Mike Sweeney hit a three-run shot in
the 12th at St. Petersburg, Fla.</TE>
<TE>   A game after Raul Ibanez hit a two-out, two-run homer in the ninth
off Esteban Yan to rally the Royals to a 6-5 victory, Kansas City
again victimized the Devil Ray closer.</TE>
<TE>   Mayne homered on a 2-0 pitch from Yan to tie the score at 3-3. Yan
has blown four of his last five save chances.</TE>

<DL>SEATTLE</DL>
<LD>Alfonso Soriano got his mark, Bernie Williams just missed.</LD>
<LD>   Soriano homered to become the only second baseman to post a 30-30
season and Williams' streak ended at 11 consecutive hits--one short
of the record--as the New York Yankees defeated the Seattle Mariners,
8-3, Saturday.</LD>
<LD>   "I think it was a great run," Williams said. "I had a lot of fun
with it. And obviously you don't expect those things to last. It just
wasn't meant to be."</LD>
<TE>   Derek Jeter, Jorge Posada and John Vander Wal also homered as the
Yankees won their sixth in a row.</TE>
<TE>   Soriano hit his 30th homer in the seventh inning off Mariner
reliever James Baldwin. Soriano, in his second full season at only 24
years old, earlier stole his league-leading 34th base.</TE>
<TE>   Soriano hit his 29th homer last Sunday off Oakland's Mark Mulder.</TE>
<TE>   "Now, I want to forget about 30-30," he said. "Now, I want to keep
going and play hard every day because the season's not over yet."</TE>
<TE>   Williams singled in the first inning off Ryan Franklin (4-3), then
grounded out to third baseman Jeff Cirillo in the third.</TE>
<TE>   Williams was two for five and is batting .339, second in the
league behind Seattle's Ichiro Suzuki.</TE>
<TE>   Franklin said Williams had good karma going for him in the first.</TE>
<TE>   "He didn't hit it hard," Franklin said. "He just rolled it between
Cirillo and [shortstop Carlos] Guillen. He had a little--I don't want
to say luck because he is such a good hitter--but he had a little
something working for him."</TE>
<TE>   Williams came up one hit shy of tying the major league mark of 12
consecutive hits set by Mike "Pinky" Higgins of the 1938 Boston Red
Sox and tied by Walt Dropo of the 1952 Detroit Tigers.</TE>
<TE>   Williams reached base safely in 13 consecutive plate appearances,
three shy of the mark set by Ted Williams with the Red Sox in 1957.</TE>
<TE>   After going four for four Friday night, Williams said he didn't
want to know what the record was. But he acknowledged after
Saturday's game that he found out anyway.</TE>
<TE>   "I made a few calls last night and for some reason people watching
the game [on TV] said, 'Oh, my God, you know what?' " Williams said.</TE>

<HD>Hot Angels Get Burned by a Crisp</HD>
<DH>Baseball: Rookie leadoff hitter sparks Indians' 9-4 victory
that keeps Anaheim out of first place in AL West.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PAUL GUTIERREZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The player with the best name in the major leagues has been a major
leaguer for only four days.</LD>
<LD>   But the Angels are anything but kookoo for Coco Crisp. More like
sick of seeing him.</LD>
<LD>   The Cleveland Indians' new leadoff hitter, who was recalled from
double-A Akron on Wednesday, has been leaving his mark all over the
Angels this series. Crisp, a switch-hitting center fielder,
jump-started the Indians' come-from-behind 9-4 victory Saturday
night, a loss that kept the Angels from claiming first place in the
American League West.</LD>
<TE>   Instead, Anaheim's six-game winning streak came to an end, the
team remained a half-game behind the Seattle Mariners and the Angels'
lead in the AL wild-card race dropped to 1 1/2 games over the Oakland
Athletics.</TE>
<TE>   Crisp, whose name being announced drew some chuckles from the
Edison Field crowd of 39,866, was the Indians' catalyst in going
three for five (for the second night in a row) with a double, two
runs batted in and scoring a run.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm just trying to take a deep breath and take it all in," said
Crisp, who graduated from Inglewood High, was drafted out of L.A.
Pierce Junior College in 1999 by St. Louis and came to Cleveland on
Aug. 6 as the player to be named in the July 19 trade that sent
former Angel Chuck Finley from the Indians to the Cardinals.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm just trying to do everything hard--run hard, hit the ball
hard, play hard. Hopefully it works out."</TE>
<TE>   Angel Manager Mike Scioscia was impressed with the speedy Crisp.</TE>
<TE>   "For a youngster coming into this league and getting an
opportunity," Scioscia said, "he's opening some eyes. He has the
makings of being an exciting player."</TE>
<TE>   When Crisp, 22, made his big league debut last week, he became the
fourth member of the 13-year-old Reviving Baseball in the Inner
Cities (RBI) program to make it to the major leagues, with Vic
Darensbourg (Florida Marlins), Luis Matos (Baltimore Orioles) and
James Lofton (Boston Red Sox).</TE>
<TE>   "There's some pride in that," said Crisp, who played in the Los
Angeles RBI program from 1994-97 and now lives in Desert Hot Springs.
"I hope to one day be able to give back."</TE>
<TE>   Angel starter Jarrod Washburn probably wished that Crisp was as
magnanimous against him.</TE>
<TE>   Washburn (15-4) was staked to a 2-0 lead in the first inning but
couldn't make it stand. The left-handed ace was charged with seven
runs in 6 2/3 innings while giving up nine hits, striking out two and
walking two.</TE>
<TE>   "I wasn't very good," Washburn said. "I was missing my spots the
whole game, my command wasn't what I wanted and it took a while to
bite me in the [behind] but it did.</TE>
<TE>   "We can't make the playoffs with me pitching like this."</TE>
<TE>   For the second consecutive game, the Angels jumped on the Indians
with two runs in the first inning.</TE>
<TE>   David Eckstein, who singled and then stole second and third to
give him a team-leading 18 steals, scored on Garret Anderson's
one-out single up the middle. Orlando Palmeiro, who had walked, then
came home on Troy Glaus' sacrifice fly.</TE>
<TE>   Cleveland got one run back in the third, on Crisp's run-scoring
double, tied it in the fifth, on a Crisp single, and took a 3-2 lead
in the sixth on Jim Thome's 37th home run.</TE>
<TE>   Glaus got the Angels even in the sixth when he took Cleveland
starter Jason Phillips halfway up the left-field foul pole for Glaus'
team-leading 21st homer.</TE>
<TE>   Cleveland chased Washburn with a six-run seventh inning, in which
the Indians sent nine batters to the plate and were helped by an
Eckstein throwing error.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels, who left the bases loaded in the fifth and sixth
innings, scored their final run in the ninth on Adam Kennedy's home
run off former Dodger reliever Terry Mulholland.</TE>
<TE>   Crisp, meanwhile, was still adjusting to going six for 10 in his
first two major league games in a stadium he often visited growing
up. Having already collected the ball from his first hit and lineup
cards, he had to hurry to meet the dozen or so friends and family
members who were awaiting him.</TE>
<TE>   "This is just unreal," Crisp said. "It's just so cool to be able
to do this with my family and friends here. They called and told me I
was on ESPN."</TE>

<HD>Scioscia Hopes Players Won't Get Out of Shape</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>With the Angels looking to secure a playoff berth for the first time
since 1986, Manager Mike Scioscia is holding out hope that his
players would conduct voluntary workouts among themselves during a
strike, which could start on Aug. 30.</LD>
<LD>   "If it does happen, obviously they're on their own," he said. "The
players would be going on strike for a reason and I think it would
behoove them to obviously stay in as close to shape as they can
because as we experienced in 1985, I think it was a one-day or
two-day [strike], that's one thing. But if you're going to be out two
weeks, that's another thing."</LD>
<LD>   The Dodger catcher during the 1985 work stoppage, Scioscia said a
core group of his teammates stuck around during the brief layoff to
stay sharp, a move that was not advised by team management. Scioscia
said he wasn't sure if he was permitted to advise the Angels to work
out in anticipation of a strike settlement.</LD>
<TE>   "It's up to the individual feelings of every player," Scioscia
said. "Certainly there would be a sentiment to say, 'We're on strike
for a reason.' Then there's a sentiment that says, 'We want to keep
going.' Our club, I think, we have guys that will keep themselves
going, but it won't be addressed by my standpoint because it's a
personal choice of a labor issue."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Starting his second consecutive game after coming off the bench
for two because of a fatigued right leg, Darin Erstad said he's not
concerned, because it irritates him every year.</TE>
<TE>   "Not one bit," he said. "It's just part of the grind of the
season.</TE>
<TE>   "It's from all the diving around. I hit the turf somewhat hard in
Toronto [last week] and it just sends everything kind of out of
kilter and you need it realigned. That's the way it goes sometimes."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Tim Salmon sat out his sixth consecutive game because of a sore
left hand after being hit by a pitch Aug. 10. Salmon did not swing a
bat Saturday and is still trying to regain grip strength.</TE>
<TE>   "It didn't feel worse today," he said, "so that's a good sign.
Maybe a more realistic target is to [play] on the road this week."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Left-handed reliever Scott Schoeneweis was available Saturday
night after a stiff back precluded him from being called on Friday
night.... Fellow left-handed reliever Dennis Cook threw off a mound
for the first time since going on the disabled list with a torn
rotator cuff July 13.</TE>

<HD>RACKED With Trouble</HD>
<DH>Selig Says There Are No Militant Owners Telling Him What to
Do to Break Union</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Ross Newhan</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It was only a few days ago that Bud Selig's 93-year-old mother-in-law
fell and broke her hip. This came only a few weeks after his wife
underwent hip replacement surgery.</LD>
<LD>   There is no evidence the condition is contagious, but now the
commissioner is up to his own hips in controversy again as his
industry limps toward another damaging--and some would say
fatal--work stoppage that many will blame on him when they are not
blaming a union whose members average almost $2.4 million in salary,
which would undoubtedly be a picket-line record.</LD>
<LD>   Of course, there is enough blame to go around, and Selig is the
easiest of targets.</LD>
<TE>   And now it is being reported, including in Friday's editions of
The Times, that he remains under the lobbying power and influence of
a small group of militant owners demanding he stay rigid on the
pivotal bargaining issue of a payroll tax, insisting the threshold at
which the tax is triggered and the tax itself be kept at levels that
would intimidate and affect more high-spending clubs than only the
New York Yankees, which would be the minimal result of the union's
initial proposal.</TE>
<TE>   First of all, Selig agreed in a weekend conversation from his
Milwaukee home that he is definitely the bottom line on management's
labor position. No deal will be taken to the owners for ratification
without his approval and no commissioner, he concurred, has ever had
broader powers over labor or other industry matters--authority voted
him by the owners in a series of initiatives since his tenure began.</TE>
<TE>   Second, he volunteered, management's position on the tax and the
other labor issues should not have come as a surprise to the union or
anyone else because it was all spelled out in the publicly released
report by his blue ribbon economic committee two years ago.</TE>
<TE>   And third, he reiterated, baseball's economic problems simply
can't be ignored.</TE>
<TE>   He is committed, he said, to structural changes that will help
relieve the revenue and competitive disparities, but--as an
often-painstaking consensus builder who has done an unprecedented job
of keeping his constituents in line to this point--he is not under
the influence and not tied to any special interest clique, any big-or
small-market coalition.</TE>
<TE>   "For people to think I'm unduly influenced, that I have any more
commitment to or conversations with any one owner or any group of
owners, is simply wrong," Selig said. "The fact of the matter is that
the vast majority of clubs, 27 or 28 of the 30, now fall into the
same class, now face the same problems. This isn't 1994, when every
decision depended on a big-and small-market caucus. Now, the problems
that affect the industry as a whole affect almost every individual
club."</TE>
<TE>   Certainly, the explosion in some markets of local cable and media
revenue has exacerbated the gulf between the haves and have-nots, and
the fact that 17 teams are more than 10 games behind their division
leaders in mid-August suggests a broader problem than the union's
often simplistic--although in some cases accurate--view of individual
mismanagement.</TE>
<TE>   However, baseball's economics remain a murky proposition. Former
New York Met co-owner Nelson Doubleday, in fact, recently accused
Selig of creating "phantom losses" by doctoring the books and then
had the gall, according to a source, of telling Selig that he hoped
he didn't take it personally. And people close to the bargaining
process insist that if there is going to be a compromise on the tax
issue and a settlement before Aug. 30, Selig will have to weigh the
potential damage of a strike against the sentiments of that militant
core he denies holding power and with whom he denies having conducted
exclusionary conference calls.</TE>
<TE>   Yet, Yankee owner George Steinbrenner, determined to protect his
resources against increased tax and revenue sharing incursions,
recently told the New York Times that Selig is indeed being
influenced by a primarily small-market group of allies, and sources
insist that the group is indeed a significant factor, some even
believing the union can be broken.</TE>
<TE>   The group is said to include John Moores of San Diego, Drayton
McLane of Houston, David Glass of Kansas City and Carl Pohlad of
Minnesota, with Stan Kasten of Atlanta (generally considered now
baseball's No. 1 hawk) and Jerry Reinsdorf of the Chicago White Sox
the band leaders.</TE>
<TE>   Reached at home Friday night, Reinsdorf insisted he is not
involved and refused further comment. The Calabasas-based former
agent Dennis Gilbert, now a White Sox advisor, said he recently spent
eight days with Reinsdorf in Chicago and had no indication he was
pulling any strings.</TE>
<TE>   "I think Jerry was so vilified [for his alleged behind-the-scenes
role] in 1994 that he has made a conscientious effort to stay out of
it this time," Gilbert said. "He has no desire for any kind of work
stoppage. He wants a settlement."</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps, but it has been speculated that the owners didn't mind
the union setting a strike date, believing it would prompt a public
backlash against the players.</TE>
<TE>   If that was the case, it could prove to be a dangerous gambit for
both owners and players. A strike date may accelerate bargaining in
other industries, but it has never worked in baseball, where all
eight previous negotiations have ended in a work stoppage and it
failed to protect the players against a unilateral implementation of
new work rules by the owners in 1994. It took a federal judge to
protect them.</TE>
<TE>   The lesson in all of that should be that it's time to throw out
history and mistrust, to quit bemoaning Selig's inexplicable
interruption of negotiations last summer, to call off the search for
Paul Beeston, to stop wailing about the wasted opportunity while
Selig and the owners were pursuing contraction.</TE>
<TE>   These negotiations are far further along than those of 1994, when
the industry began a 232-day work stoppage on Aug. 12. The sides are
in the same ballpark on steroid testing, a worldwide draft and
increased revenue sharing. There has been far more compromise and
civility--aside from what sources say was a verbal meltdown by union
leader Don Fehr during Wednesday's tax discussion--than in '94.</TE>
<TE>   The union now needs to stop protecting the Yankees--which has
become a burden for even the union since Steinbrenner's fully loaded
payroll is $171 million--and give the owners a meaningful payroll
restraint. The owners, in turn, have to realize the union has made
concessions in several other areas already and meet the players
halfway on a tax. Take a partial cap this time, try for the derby the
next.</TE>
<TE>   It should be this clear:</TE>
<TE>   If, in the shadow of Sept. 11 and amid the nation's reeling
economy, with major league attendance down 6%, Selig and Fehr can't
avoid a strike and reach a settlement from where the negotiations
currently sit, both should consider stepping down.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, some insist that Selig would first have to call that
mysterious covey of hawks.</TE>

<HD>Sheff Has Recipe for Success</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JASON REID</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>First the news, then the views....</LD>
<LD>   News: Gary Sheffield helps the Atlanta Braves run away from the
pack in the National League East, delivering everything they expected
and more.</LD>
<LD>   Views: That's what great players do, and even the Dodgers
reluctantly acknowledge the All-Star outfielder is among the best in
the business.</LD>
<TE>   The Braves were enthusiastic about the January trade that brought
Sheffield from the Dodgers for pitcher Odalis Perez and outfielder
Brian Jordan, believing they improved more than any team in the
league with that one move. Their outlook didn't change while
Sheffield was slowed by a left wrist injury in April and the club
went 12-15, though some speculated the Braves were done.</TE>
<TE>   Ah, not so fast.</TE>
<TE>   The Braves began the weekend with the major leagues' best record
since April (67-26) and top overall mark (79-41), effectively
wrapping up the East with a 19 1/2-game lead. The pitching staff,
including a lights-out bullpen, continues to provide the foundation
for success, but Sheffield has been the difference in the mix on
offense.</TE>
<TE>   Chipper Jones and Andruw Jones have credited Sheffield with
transforming a batting order often punchless last season, improving
the group with his rare combination of power, high batting average
and on-base percentage. Sheffield is having a typically solid season,
hitting .299 with 21 home runs, 70 runs batted in and 65 runs. He
also has on-base and slugging percentages of .389 and .509,
respectively, and has performed well defensively in returning to
right field after playing the opposite side for the Dodgers the
previous three seasons.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm having the most fun I ever have playing this game," Sheffield
said recently. "It's great when you look around and see guys like
Chipper, and [Tom] Glavine and [Greg] Maddux, and you know these guys
know what playing this game is all about. It's even better than I
thought it would be."</TE>
<TE>   As good as Sheffield has been on the field, the Braves said he has
been even better in the clubhouse, leaving the baggage from his
Dodger wars at the door.</TE>
<TE>   Everyone knew the Dodgers had to get rid of Sheffield, and General
Manager Dan Evans acquired a talented young starter in Perez and the
respected Jordan, whose calming presence has helped stabilize a club
on edge since Fox picked up the keys.</TE>
<TE>   But Jordan has struggled because of injuries, putting more
pressure on All-Star right fielder Shawn Green to shoulder the load
offensively. Jordan, who can demand to be traded after the season as
a player traded during a multiyear contract, has a salary of $9
million in 2003, and is guaranteed $2.5 million more in a 2004
contract buyout.</TE>
<TE>   Despite Perez's success this season, the Braves have no regrets
about trading for Sheffield. Great players make a difference, and the
Braves got one from the Dodgers for an affordable price.</TE>
<TE>   News: Boston Red Sox right-handers Pedro Martinez and Derek Lowe
form the American League's top starting tandem.</TE>
<TE>   Views: Finally, Martinez has front-of-the-rotation help.</TE>
<TE>   Lowe continues to roll as the surprising half of the Red Sox's 1-2
punch, challenging his three-time Cy Young Award-winning teammate for
this season's trophy. They are 33-8 combined, helping the Red Sox
keep the heat on the Angels and Oakland Athletics in the AL wild-card
race, and the converted closer leads the league with 17 victories.</TE>
<TE>   Not bad for a guy who lost 10 games out of the bullpen, suffered
six blown saves and was booed off the mound at Fenway Park last
season.</TE>
<TE>   "It motivates you," Lowe said. "It doesn't necessarily hurt you. I
played here long enough to understand if you struggle, you're going
to get booed. If you pitch well, you're going to get cheered.</TE>
<TE>   "So it motivates you and drives you to say, 'I'm going to play
here for a lot more years. I don't want to be booed every time I
pitch.' So it drove me to be a better pitcher, not to have that
happen."</TE>
<TE>   Good move.</TE>
<TE>   News: Arizona Diamondbacks go 26-9 after All-Star break to sprint
past Dodgers in the National League West.</TE>
<TE>   Views: It was only a matter of time.</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers played way over their heads in the first half while
the Diamondbacks were building toward a goal, having been here before
and understanding championships typically aren't won in June.</TE>
<TE>   The Diamondbacks didn't panic while the surprising Dodgers were
overcoming their substantial offensive deficiencies, believing
everything would eventually fall into place. Sure enough, the Dodgers
flopped to start the second half and the Diamondbacks made their move
behind the two-headed monster of Curt Schilling and Randy Johnson,
engaged in another in-house Cy Young Award battle.</TE>
<TE>   The buzz in the NL clubhouse at the All-Star game was that Arizona
was ready to take off, and the buzz was correct. Repeating in the
division, though, is only part of the plan for the defending World
Series champions.</TE>
<TE>   News: New York Yankee batters thrive under hitting instructor Rick
Down.</TE>
<TE>   Views: The Yankees, who last season struggled offensively, are
leading the American League in runs, total bases, home runs, runs
batted in, slugging percentage, walks and on-base percentage, and
Down's contribution has been a key part of the story. He has a great
rapport with players and understands the mechanics of batting as well
as anyone, helping him succeed in his Big Apple homecoming.</TE>
<TE>   Down had a 371-273 record in six seasons managing in the Yankee
farm system, leading the club's triple-A team to three consecutive
division titles and two league championships, and became the Yankees'
hitting instructor in 1993. The club led the AL in batting in '93 and
'94, but owner George Steinbrenner fired Down after the '95 season in
a move many in the organization regretted.</TE>
<TE>   After stints with the Baltimore Orioles, Dodgers and Red Sox, Down
finally returned to the Yankees and they couldn't be happier.</TE>

<HD>A Tents Situation for Leaders</HD>

<DL>CHASKA, Minn.</DL>
<LD>There is now a Lake Hazeltine II on the driving range. It appeared
after a thunderstorm finished dumping three inches of rain on
Hazeltine National Golf Club early Saturday morning, and that doubles
the number of locations suitable for celebration in case whoever wins
the PGA Championship today decides to take a dip.</LD>
<LD>   Unless Tiger Woods does something he has never done before--come
from behind on the last day to win a major--it's going to be a
Tiger-free victory party.</LD>
<LD>   Woods is five shots back, but he would have been closer if he had
avoided hitting his drive at the 18th just in front of the white
picket fence guarding the hospitality tents.</LD>
<TE>   Tiger sent the ball about 45 yards off line, which meant it was a
lot closer to the artichoke dip than the fairway. He wound up with a
bogey and even though it was the only one he made all day, there are
still four players in front of him.</TE>
<TE>   Here is a short list of the players who are playing the best so
far at the fourth and final major of the year, with 18 holes to go:</TE>
<TE>   * A 30-year-old guy who won a major five years ago, thus allowing
his "youthful potential" license to lapse.</TE>
<TE>   * A 31-year-old who once quit golf to sell car stereos and
cellular phones.</TE>
<TE>   * A 46-year-old former college golf coach who made it as a pro
after four tries.</TE>
<TE>   * A 42-year-old who won his only major 13 years ago, when Woods
was 13.</TE>
<TE>   You probably recognize them better by their names: Justin Leonard,
Rich Beem, Fred Funk, Mark Calcavecchia.</TE>
<TE>   It is possible to argue a case for each one, that a victory today
would mean the most.</TE>
<TE>   Beem has missed nine cuts this year, but he also won the
International a couple of weeks ago. He convinced 30 investors to
back him with $80,000 in 1999 after he earned his PGA Tour card at
qualifying school, then won the Kemper Open in his rookie season.</TE>
<TE>   This is only the fourth major Beem has played in his career, but
that's enough for him to recognize what it means if he wins. He says
he knows he will "get a lot of cool stuff," so he's got that going
for him.</TE>
<TE>   Funk and Calcavecchia are at the front of the old-guy brigade, the
over-40 bunch that has been overlooked while golf continues its
fascination with the new breed.</TE>
<TE>   Besides coaching Maryland's golf team, Funk's resume includes
being a newspaper circulation supervisor, so presumably he knows it
will be good copy if he delivers today.</TE>
<TE>   Calcavecchia has won 10 times on the PGA Tour and won the British
Open in 1989. He has been around so long, it's hard to remember that
his dad used to run a bowling alley back in Laurel, Neb., or that he
had to go to qualifying school three times and spent four years
floundering before he finally made it.</TE>
<TE>   Then there's Leonard, whose three-shot lead over Beem would look
quite comfortable if not for the fact that it has been five years
since he won the British Open at Troon. And that's a long time
between major titles.</TE>
<TE>   It's not as though Leonard is in the twilight of his career, but
he has been in the spotlight since he won the 1992 U.S. Amateur. Two
years later, at the University of Texas, Leonard won the NCAA title
with a 17-under-par total that equaled Phil Mickelson's record.</TE>
<TE>   It seemed as though everything Leonard touched turned to birdie.
He turned pro in 1994 and played on sponsor's invitations and made
enough money to earn his PGA Tour card without having to go to
qualifying school.</TE>
<TE>   In 1996, he won his first tournament, the Buick Open. And 1997 had
every appearance of a breakout year. He won the Kemper Open, then
took Royal Troon by storm when he closed with a 65 to beat Jesper
Parnevik and Darren Clarke by three shots.</TE>
<TE>   At 25, Leonard was the youngest British Open champion in 18 years,
since Seve Ballesteros won at 22.</TE>
<TE>   This was only the beginning, to be sure. As it has turned out, it
was only the beginning of unfulfilled expectations. Leonard has won
four more times in the five years since that July in Scotland and he
has made nearly $13 million, so it's not as though he has been
wasting his time.</TE>
<TE>   And Leonard has even come close to winning more majors. He was
second to Davis Love in the 1997 PGA Championship at Winged Foot and
lost out to Paul Lawrie in a three-way playoff at the 1999 British
Open that Jean Van de Velde threw away at Carnoustie. Plus, he made
that big putt at the 1999 Ryder Cup.</TE>
<TE>   But golf expects more of those who are designated as superstars at
an early age.</TE>
<TE>   In his last 12 majors, Leonard has had only one top-10 finish, at
last year's PGA Championship, so the responsibility for living up to
his reputation is entirely in his own hands.</TE>
<TE>   Chances are, Leonard will do well, if not for his golfing talent,
then for how he has prepared himself for the task. Leonard has picked
up running and competes in marathons. He ran the Dallas Marathon in
less than four hours.</TE>
<TE>   This PGA Championship is no sprint, not in four days and 72 holes
and playing through and around bad weather. So being a marathon
runner should come in handy. And, maybe at 30, Leonard will show
everyone that he's in it for the long haul.</TE>

<HD>The Fighting Spirit Hasn't Left Toney</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE SPRINGER</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>He stood up in a San Fernando Valley restaurant crowded with noontime
customers, whipped off his shirt and flexed his muscles.</LD>
<LD>   It was the kind of behavior one might expect from a novice fighter
who isn't quite sure how to get attention.</LD>
<LD>   James Toney is no novice. He has been a professional fighter for
14 years. He has a 64-4-2 record with 41 knockouts. He won the
International Boxing Federation's middleweight title and successfully
defended it six times. He won the IBF super-middleweight crown and
successfully defended it three times. He has beaten Iran Barkley,
Michael Nunn, Reggie Johnson, Steve Little and Doug DeWitt. He beat
Mike McCallum twice. He is a former Ring magazine fighter of the
year.</LD>
<TE>   Yet, at 33, Toney still feels he has to prove himself.</TE>
<TE>   He insists he will do precisely that today when he again bares his
chest, steps into the ring at the Pechanga Resort and Casino in
Temecula and fights Jason Robinson (16-2, 10) in an IBF cruiserweight
title-elimination match.</TE>
<TE>   The winner becomes the mandatory challenger for IBF champion
Vassily Jirov.</TE>
<TE>   Toney, who in his career has experienced weight problems,
management problems, problems with his work ethic, knows his
professed resolve will invite more yawns than yahoos. He knows his
story has been told by every fighter who ever vowed to come back, and
that it rarely has a happy ending.</TE>
<TE>   "I like the doubters," Toney said. "It makes me work even harder.
When you go through a phase, you go through it for a reason. It tests
your fortitude. This is the future. This is my last chance. I want to
leave my legacy behind as a great fighter."</TE>
<TE>   Toney has a new backer in his corner, one who can relate to his
comeback. Promoter Dan Goossen is also starting over after an ugly
split with America Presents, the promotional organization that
collapsed under the weight of financial problems.</TE>
<TE>   Goossen, who operated out of Denver and then Las Vegas, has
returned to his roots. A San Fernando Valley product, he has formed
Goossen Tutor Promotions in Sherman Oaks.</TE>
<TE>   Toney is the biggest name Goossen has landed thus far, so today's
fight is also a key to Goossen's future.</TE>
<TE>   "At a young age, James made a lot of money and it was tough to
keep his focus," Goossen said. "But his [comeback] is not something
we are selling, but something we are doing. When he was over 200
pounds, we didn't even want to send out pictures of him looking like
that, but now he'll probably come in for the fight under 190.</TE>
<TE>   "After Sunday, we are going to go after Jirov and get the title
back, but we are not going to call out the names of the people James
wants to fight. If we did, they would run anyway."</TE>
<TE>   Smokin' Like Joe</TE>
<TE>   The biggest acclaim Toney has received recently was for his
victory over Muhammad Ali.</TE>
<TE>   OK, so it was Will Smith playing Ali.</TE>
<TE>   Toney played Joe Frazier in last year's "Ali" movie and proved he
could not only imitate Frazier's style, but could effectively handle
a few lines of dialogue. Toney has a powerful scene in a car where,
as Frazier, he offers the down-on-his-luck Ali a few dollars.</TE>
<TE>   One who wasn't impressed with Toney's performance, however, was
Frazier.</TE>
<TE>   "He said I didn't look like him," Toney said. "That's fine with
me. Joe Frazier is an ugly man."</TE>
<TE>   In a grueling scene, Toney and Smith recreated the dramatic moment
when Frazier floored Ali with a left hook at the end of their 1971
fight. They went through eight takes before director Michael Mann was
satisfied.</TE>
<TE>   "I really caught him one time," said Toney of Smith. "I didn't
mean to. Will told me, 'Man, I'd hate to be on the end of your
punches every day.' "</TE>
<TE>   Toney hopes Robinson will be saying the same thing today.</TE>
<TE>   Feeling No Pain</TE>
<TE>   Wednesday, a day after his private plane had skidded off a runway
in Big Bear and come to rest in a field, engulfed in flames, promoter
Bob Arum awoke at his Las Vegas home without any lingering effects of
the harrowing experience.</TE>
<TE>   The six others on board also escaped injury after exiting through
a wall of flames.</TE>
<TE>   The first thing Arum did the morning after was attend services at
his synagogue to give thanks.</TE>
<TE>   He also showed his sense of humor was unscathed, saying: "Someone
told me that if I had hair like Don King, I wouldn't have made it out
of there without getting burned."</TE>
<TE>   Quick Jabs</TE>
<TE>   Mike Tyson hopes to fight either World Boxing Assn. champion John
Ruiz or Clifford Etienne in November.... In the semi-main event on
the Toney-Robinson card, IBF junior-lightweight champion Steve Forbes
(20-1, 5) will defend against David Santos (42-4, 27). Tickets for
the card are priced from $45 to $125. The first bout is at 2:15 p.m.
with the main event at 3. That fight will be shown tape-delayed on
Fox Sports Net.</TE>

<LD>If history is any indicator, a baseball strike would have no
long-term effect on major league attendance, a joint study led by an
economics professor at Cal State Bakersfield suggests.</LD>
<LD>   David Berri, who co-authored the study with Martin Schmidt, an
economics professor at Portland State, found that after player
strikes in 1981 and 1994-95--despite claims to the contrary--fans
returned to the games almost immediately.</LD>
<LD>   "In the end, it appears that neither strike has had a lasting
effect on attendance," Berri said. "One might expect that attendance
would recover from a strike, but given the rhetoric of fans, such a
recovery would take a period of years. Our research suggests that the
recovery occurs immediately."</LD>
<TE>   Trivia time: Earlier this season, David Eckstein of the Angels hit
grand slams in consecutive games. Who was the last major league
player to do it before him?</TE>
<TE>   House rules: Charley Walters in the St. Paul Pioneer Press: "The
house Tiger Woods is using this week at the Bearpath Golf and Country
Club development in Eden Prairie, Minn., belongs to a notable former
athlete who is out of town with his family on vacation.</TE>
<TE>   "Word is, Woods not only had a whirlpool bath installed, but also
a large-screen TV and furniture, and has a personal cook for the
week. A little birdie says that in exchange for free rent, Woods will
pay for the owner's family vacation."</TE>
<TE>   Dynamic duos: According to Stats Inc., with Tom Glavine's victory
on Wednesday, he and Greg Maddux now have 340 combined wins as
teammates, the same number Don Drysdale and Sandy Koufax recorded
with the Dodgers from 1956-66. The Atlanta Braves' pair, who have
been together for 10 seasons (1993-2002) also did it with 66 fewer
losses, 153 to 219. Glavine and Maddux's combined earned-run average
also is slightly lower, 2.86 to 2.89.</TE>
<TE>   Money matters: Jerry Greene in the Orlando Sentinel reports that
Dale Earnhardt still has economic influence, even after his death:
"[Earnhardt] has zoomed up the Forbes.com chart of 'Richest Deceased
Celebrities.' He's No. 4 among the Dearly Departed for continued
profit directly associated to his name, reportedly earning $20
million from June 2001 through June '02."</TE>
<TE>   No. 1 on the list? Elvis Presley with $37 million.</TE>
<TE>   Sobering news: Bud Shaw of the Cleveland Plain Dealer is glad the
Cleveland Browns are taking measures this season to cut down on
drunken behavior by fans: "Your chance of going home without your
neighbor's cookies on your shoes is better than ever."</TE>
<TE>   Penalty box: Steve Rushin of Sports Illustrated, on Buffalo Sabre
owner John Rigas' recent arrest on fraud charges: "He faces up to 30
years in prison, though it may help Rigas to think of such a sentence
as a few million consecutive two-minute minors."</TE>
<TE>   Trivia answer: Albert Belle of the Baltimore Orioles in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   And finally: Jon Saraceno in USA Today: "Security at Network
Associates Coliseum, home of those nasty Oakland Raiders, has
announced the stadium's list of prohibited items, including alcohol,
illegal drugs and firearms. What's this world coming to? Next thing

<HD>Grissom's Hitting Could Create a Lineup Dilemma</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Mike DiGiovanna</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Reserve outfielder Marquis Grissom's recent hot streak has enabled
left fielder Brian Jordan to be cautious in his return from a
lower-back injury. Jordan played Friday night after a six-game
absence but did not start Saturday night because his back and
hamstrings were a little tight.</LD>
<LD>   "Normally I'd try to rush back and just hurt myself worse," Jordan
said. "When a guy is performing well and you're winning it gives you
a chance to be smart."</LD>
<LD>   But what about when Jordan is 100%?</LD>
<TE>   "Then he's going to have to figure something out," Jordan said of
Manager Jim Tracy, "because I want to play."</TE>
<TE>   Tracy, like many managers, considers this a "good" problem, having
a reserve like Grissom, who in his last 13 games is batting .409 (18
for 44) with four homers and 12 runs batted in, pushing a starter
like Jordan.</TE>
<TE>   But if Grissom, who is batting .293 with 14 homers and 49 RBIs
while spending most of the season in a center-field platoon with Dave
Roberts, continues to produce, Tracy will face difficult daily lineup
decisions.</TE>
<TE>   Does he play Grissom in left and risk alienating Jordan? Does he
play Grissom in center and Jordan in left against right-handed
starters more often, leaving Roberts, his sparkplug leadoff batter,
on the bench? Or does he keep Grissom and Roberts in the platoon that
was so successful in the first half?</TE>
<TE>   "The only way to handle it is to do what's best for the team,"
Tracy said. "What gives us the best chance to be playing in October?
... You can't ignore the job Grissom is doing right now."</TE>
<TE>   As he did Saturday night, when he sat Eric Karros and Tyler
Houston against Pedro Astacio because they've struggled against the
Met right-hander, Tracy will look closer at individual matchups,
who's swinging the hottest bat, who will benefit from a day off.</TE>
<TE>   One move Tracy won't make is to move right fielder Shawn Green to
first and play Grissom, Roberts and Jordan in the outfield.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not that comfortable with that now, and I don't think Shawn
would be," Tracy said. "That's blatantly playing a guy out of
position and into a position to fail."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   A combination of three games on Montreal's hard artificial turf
and some steamy conditions in Shea Stadium Friday night sent third
baseman Adrian Beltre and his tender hamstrings to the bench Saturday
night.</TE>
<TE>   "Instead of continuing to push the envelope and risk pulling a
hamstring, Stan [Johnston, Dodger trainer] felt we should give him a
day off," Tracy said before the game.</TE>
<TE>   Closer Eric Gagne, who pitched in four consecutive games Tuesday
through Friday night, was not available Saturday, Tracy said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Reliever Giovanni Carrara, on the disabled list because of a
strain in his right forearm, played long toss Friday and was
scheduled to throw in the bullpen Saturday, but didn't because his
forearm felt a little tender.... Pitcher Darren Dreifort, whose
rehabilitation from major elbow surgery hit a snag when he underwent
arthroscopic surgery on his right knee July 30, is still throwing off
flat ground but hasn't returned to a bullpen mound. "The chances of
him pitching this season are not very likely," Tracy said.</TE>

<HD>Perez's Perfect Plan Held in Check</HD>
<DH>Dodgers: Pitcher retires first 19 Mets before half-swing
walk to Ordonez spoils his bid for history. L.A. wins, 10-4.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE DiGIOVANNA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>If Dodger left-hander Odalis Perez was tipping his pitches, as New
York Manager Bobby Valentine suggested Saturday night, then what does
that say about the Mets' hitters?</LD>
<LD>   Perez flirted with baseball history again, throwing six perfect
innings for the second time this season, before losing a perfect
game, a no-hitter and a shutout within the span of two pitches in the
seventh.</LD>
<LD>   The Dodgers whipped the New York Mets, 10-4, before 50,763 in Shea
Stadium, increasing their National League wild-card lead over San
Francisco to three games, their winning streak to four, and sending
the Mets to their seventh straight loss and 10th straight home
defeat.</LD>
<TE>   But the victory left a residue of regret in Perez, who walked Rey
Ordonez after a controversial full-count check swing with one out in
the seventh and gave up a two-run home run to Mike Piazza on his next
pitch.</TE>
<TE>   "It was disappointing because you don't see a perfect game too
often," said Perez, who gave up one hit and struck out seven in seven
innings. "When you don't get a call like that [to Ordonez], you have
to be disappointed. I didn't have the concentration on the next
pitch."</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers bombed Met starter Pedro Astacio for eight runs and 12
hits in three innings, prompting one reporter to ask Valentine if the
right-hander was tipping his pitches.</TE>
<TE>   "No, but the funny thing is we had Perez's pitches," Valentine
said. "You see what good that does. His glove shows every pitch he
throws. So what. It's in the [scouting report]. It's a little hard to
tell between the fastball and changeup, but it's easy to tell on the
breaking pitch. So I guess everyone might as well write that and go
tell the Dodgers."</TE>
<TE>   Perez left the Dodger clubhouse before being informed of
Valentine's remarks, but if the Mets knew what was coming, why
couldn't they hit it?</TE>
<TE>   Perez came within a Corey Patterson bad-hop infield single of a
perfect game against the Chicago Cubs on April 26, facing the minimum
27 batters that day, and he threw a one-hit shutout against Colorado
on June 25, losing a no-hitter in the sixth.</TE>
<TE>   He retired the first 19 batters Saturday night and seemed to have
some no-hit karma working when right fielder Shawn Green made two
running catches of slicing drives down the line and center fielder
Dave Roberts made a diving catch of John Valentin's fifth-inning
flare.</TE>
<TE>   Perez threw first-pitch strikes to 15 of the first 19 batters and
had no three-ball counts until Ordonez ran the count full in the
seventh. Perez threw a slider, slightly inside but close enough for
Ordonez to begin his swing.</TE>
<TE>   Home-plate umpire Brian O'Nora ruled Ordonez checked his swing,
first-base umpire Gary Cederstrom verified the call, and a deflated
Perez grooved his next pitch to Piazza, who blasted a changeup over
the left-field bullpen for a homer estimated at 455 feet.</TE>
<TE>   "That had the makings of being something awfully special," Dodger
Manager Jim Tracy said of Perez's effort. "All I can say is it was a
heck of a 3-2 pitch [to Ordonez]."</TE>
<TE>   Perez was backed by a 17-hit attack that provided much-needed
breathing room for the Dodgers. Of their previous 34 games, 21 were
decided by two runs or fewer.</TE>
<TE>   Tracy's makeshift lineup included Mark Grudzielanek replacing
Adrian Beltre (sore hamstrings) in the third spot, Dave Hansen
filling in for Beltre at third and Mike Kinkade playing first base
instead of Eric Karros or Tyler Houston.</TE>
<TE>   Karros was one for 14 (.071) in his career against Astacio,
Houston was three for 17 (.176) against the former Dodger, and
Kinkade had never faced him, so Tracy figured, why not try something
new?</TE>
<TE>   Kinkade provided the big blow in the third, a two-run double that
gave the Dodgers a four-run lead, and Hansen added an RBI double in
the third. Green, who had an RBI single in the third, followed
singles by Marquis Grissom and Grudzielanek in the fourth with a
towering three-run home run to right, his 36th.</TE>
<TE>   Met fans were so disgusted with the 8-0 deficit they began
chanting, "Go on strike! Go on strike!" Valentine was asked how
frustrating the Mets' recent skid has been.</TE>
<TE>   "It's killing me," he said. "What do you mean by how frustrating
is it? Are you trying to test my blood pressure? It's killing me.
It's killing my folks. It's killing my family. It's killing my dogs.
This is terrible."</TE>

<HD>Cienfuegos Gets It Straight for Galaxy</HD>
<DH>Soccer: Veteran misses penalty kick but scores two
second-half goals in 4-0 victory over Colorado. L.A. jumps ahead in
standings.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GRAHAME L. JONES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>All in all, it was a peculiar Saturday night for Mauricio Cienfuegos.</LD>
<LD>   With the Galaxy and the Colorado Rapids battling for playoff
position in Major League Soccer's Western Division, the veteran
midfielder from El Salvador was presented with the simplest of
opportunities to give Los Angeles a useful advantage.</LD>
<LD>   But in front of a crowd of 12,068 at the Rose Bowl, Cienfuegos
missed a first-half penalty kick. Not to worry. In the second half,
Cienfuegos scored twice, one of the goals coming on a rare diving
header, as the Galaxy shut out the Rapids, 4-0, to record its biggest
win of the season.</LD>
<TE>   More important than the margin of victory was the fact that it
pushed the Galaxy above the Rapids into third place in the division
and also moved Coach Sigi Schmid's team to within three points of the
first-place San Jose Earthquakes.</TE>
<TE>   "We got our [rear end] kicked," admitted Colorado Coach Tim
Hankinson.</TE>
<TE>   Only six games remain in the regular season for Los Angeles, and
two of them are against the defending champion Earthquakes, who were
held to a 2-2 tie at home Saturday by D.C. United.</TE>
<TE>   "We're still looking at San Jose," said Alexi Lalas, who scored
the first goal of the night on a looping header in the 20th minute
that bounced off the right post and caromed off Colorado goalkeeper
David Kramer into the net.</TE>
<TE>   The goal came only eight minutes after Cienfuegos' penalty miss.</TE>
<TE>   Referee Jair Marrufo awarded the penalty kick after Rapid defender
Wes Hart tripped the Galaxy's Tyrone Marshall, but instead of
powering his shot from 12 yards, Cienfuegos tried to steer it into
the lower right corner.</TE>
<TE>   Kramer guessed correctly and dived to his left to turn the ball
around the post.</TE>
<TE>   Colorado was outplayed in midfield by the Galaxy trio of Simon
Elliott, Peter Vagenas and Cienfuegos and the Rapids did not manage a
shot on goal. They trailed by only one goal at the half, but in the
second 45 minutes Los Angeles took complete control, with Cobi Jones
leading the way.</TE>
<TE>   Jones assisted on three goals Saturday and has three goals and
nine assists since returning from the World Cup. Schmid said he had
told the winger at the beginning of the season that he wanted him to
be more of a creator than a scorer this year.</TE>
<TE>   With Carlos Ruiz, the team's leading scorer, sidelined because of
accumulated yellow cards, Schmid started Jones and Alejandro Moreno
up top, with Sasha Victorine also in more of an attacking role.</TE>
<TE>   Schmid sent Gavin Glinton on in place of Moreno at the start of
the second half, but Glinton lasted only nine minutes before landing
awkwardly and breaking a bone in his left ankle.</TE>
<TE>   Brian Mullan came on in Glinton's place in the 54th minute and
within five minutes had helped the Galaxy double its lead.</TE>
<TE>   Ezra Hendrickson sent the ball down the right to Mullan, who sent
a high cross into the goal area, over the head of leaping defender
Steven Herdsman. Cienfuegos launched himself at the ball, connected
with it squarely and powered it past Kramer.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, in the 89th minute, Mullan and Jones combined to set up
Cienfuegos for his second goal after he had failed to score in his
previous 16 games this season.</TE>

<HD>It's a Mixed-Bag Day for Frankel</HD>
<DH>Horse racing: Trainer sees two of his four horses win Grade
I races, including Beat Hollow in the Arlington Million.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BOB MIESZERSKI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Bobby Frankel was a .500 hitter in four Grade I races run at
Arlington Park and Saratoga on Saturday.</LD>
<LD>   Although the country's leading trainer would have preferred a
sweep, he should be delighted with what he did get. He could have
just as easily drawn a blank.</LD>
<LD>   Favored Beat Hollow gave Frankel and Prince Khalid Abdullah's
Juddmonte Farms their second Arlington Million win in three years
with a head victory over archrival Sarafan in a blanket finish, but
anybody who watched the Million knows who should have been in the
winner's circle.</LD>
<TE>   Falcon Flight, a 17-1 longshot who had been perfect in two
previous starts over the Arlington turf, was blocked badly in deep
stretch under jockey Rene Douglas. He finished fast to be fifth,
beaten by less than a length. There is little doubt he would have
scored the shocker had he gotten through cleanly.</TE>
<TE>   Then, two races later, Chiselling, another Frankel-Juddmonte
production, got up in the final strides to edge Jazz Beat by a nose
in the $400,000 Secretariat.</TE>
<TE>   Ridden by Kent Desormeaux, the son of Woodman became the latest
Grade I winner for the dam Toussaud. A good race horse in her day,
Toussaud has produced, among others, Decarchy, Chester House and
Honest Lady.</TE>
<TE>   These two victories for Frankel came after his day had gotten off
to a rugged start. Tates Creek was last in Arlington's $700,000
Beverly D. Stakes, which was won by 2-1 second choice Golden Apples,
and You finished third behind Farda Amiga and pacesetter Allamerican
Bertie in the $750,000 Alabama Stakes at Saratoga.</TE>
<TE>   Victimized by an extremely troubled trip when second to Sarafan in
the Eddie Read Handicap three weeks earlier at Del Mar, Beat Hollow
couldn't have asked for a better journey in the Million.</TE>
<TE>   Ridden for the first time by Jerry Bailey, he stalked the slow
pace set by Forbidden Apple, who wound up third, a nose behind
Sarafan, then prevailed in 2:02 4/5 for the 1 1/4 miles. It was the
seventh win in 10 starts for the 5-year-old son of Sadler's Wells and
his third Grade I victory in 2002.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't expect to be worse than third [early in the race] and
then it was up to Beat Hollow," Bailey said. "I didn't want to make
the lead too quickly because I knew that it would give Sarafan a shot
at us late."</TE>
<TE>   Afterward, Frankel indicated Beat Hollow will be pointed to the
Breeders' Cup Mile rather than the Breeders' Cup Turf, which is a
half-mile longer. The Breeders' Cup will be held for the first time
at Arlington Park on Oct. 26. "I think he'll be super going a mile,"
Frankel said.</TE>
<TE>   The Beverly D. winner also responded to a jockey change. Patrick
Valenzuela took over on the 4-year-old Pivotal filly, replacing
Garrett Gomez, and she earned her biggest victory for owner Gary
Tanaka, who was later unlucky with Falcon Flight, and trainer Ben
Cecil.</TE>
<TE>   Kept within range of the slow pace set by defending champion
England's Legend, Golden Apples took over into the stretch and went
on to beat 13-10 favorite Astra by three-quarters of a length.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Making her first start since her 20-1 surprise in the Kentucky
Oaks on May 3, Farda Amiga ($8.70) rallied past Allamerican Bertie to
win by three-quarters of a length in 2:04 3/5 at Saratoga.</TE>
<TE>   Owned by Simon Marcos, Julian and Santa Camargo and trained by
Paulo Lobo, Farda Amiga, a daughter of Broad Brush who had come down
with a virus after winning at Churchill Downs, won for the fourth
time in seven starts. She was ridden by Pat Day, who replaced the
retired Chris McCarron.</TE>
<TE>   "I think this proves she's the best 3-year-old filly in the
country," said Lobo, who indicated she may not run again until the
Breeders' Cup Distaff.</TE>
<TE>   Bella Bellucci, who probably would have been favored in the
Alabama even though she has yet to win a Grade I, was scratched by
trainer Neil Drysdale.</TE>
<TE>   "We were concerned about the track condition," Drysdale said. "She
caught a track similar to this in the Acorn [third at 7-10 on June 7
at Belmont Park] and wound up pulling a muscle behind. We didn't want
to take a chance of that happening again."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Evening Attire, at 7-2, beat pacesetter Abreeze by 1 1/2 lengths
to take the $300,000 Saratoga Breeders' Cup Handicap.</TE>
<TE>   Owned by Joseph and Mary Grant and Tom Kelly and trained by
Patrick Kelly, the 4-year-old completed the 1 1/4 miles in 2:02 4/5
under Shaun Bridgmohan.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Frankel added another stakes win when Inesperado ($6.40) beat only
three rivals in the $150,000 La Jolla Handicap at Del Mar.</TE>
<TE>   Ridden by Eddie Delahoussaye for the 3 Plus U Stable, the
3-year-old French bred won for the second time in as many U.S.
starts. He ran the 1 1/16 miles on turf in 1:43 4/5. Favored
Regiment, who got away with very slow fractions while setting the
pace, was second, ahead of stablemate Mountain Rage and
Mutinyonthebounty.</TE>

<LD>The last time a horse swept the Bing Crosby and the Pat O'Brien, the
two major sprint stakes for older horses at Del Mar, was 1991 when
Bruho won both for owner Joe Scardino and trainer Jerry Fanning.</LD>
<LD>   Disturbingthepeace will be favored to complete the same parlay
when he shoots for his sixth consecutive victory in the $150,000
O'Brien today.</LD>
<LD>   Owned by David and Rita Milch and trained by Darrell Vienna, the
4-year-old Bold Badgett gelding began his roll with a half-length
victory against California-breds in a soft allowance race on March 20
at Santa Anita, won an open allowance race on April 13, then won an
optional claimer and the Triple Bend Breeders' Cup Handicap at
Hollywood Park before taking the Crosby by three-quarters of a length
on July 27.</LD>
<TE>   Purchased privately as part of a package that included the
stakes-winning filly Above Perfection last year, Disturbingthepeace
is stretching out to his best distance in the O'Brien. He has won
three of four at seven furlongs and was second in his only defeat.</TE>
<TE>   He has shown versatility in that he has won while setting the pace
or coming from slightly off the lead. What happens today depends on
Hot Market. The gray is the likely pacesetter, but he may scratch,
leaving Disturbingthepeace to dictate things up front in a race where
the other entrants (I Love Silver, Mellow Fellow, Blu Air Force and
Komax) are all stretch runners.</TE>
<TE>   Race of the day: Black Ruby will try for her 47th win in 53 starts
in the $5,000 Cream City Mule Handicap at Ferndale. Owned by Sonny
and Mary McPherson, Black Ruby won the 660-yard race by three lengths
last year.</TE>
<TE>   Who's hot: Include. One of the better handicap horses in the
country, the 5-year-old Broad Brush horse will try for his 11th win
in 19 starts in the $350,000 Philip H. Iselin Handicap today at
Monmouth Park.</TE>
<TE>   Who's not: Trainers Joe Parga and Sean McCarthy. They are a
combined 0 for 67 in 2002.</TE>
<TE>   Exotically speaking: A pick three using Rapidough and Romanzo in
the third, Composure and Ain't It Sweep in the fourth and Unlimited
Value, Sing Because, Champ's Star and St. Remy in the fifth.</TE>
<TE>   Winners: Previous day/meet total: 3/44. Money: Previous day/meet
total: $24.00/$268.60. Total money bet: $376.</TE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Baseball labor talks resumed the day after players set an Aug. 30
strike deadline, but negotiators did not address the major economic
differences that could result in the sport's ninth work stoppage
since 1972.</LD>
<LD>   Representatives of owners and the Major League Baseball Players
Assn. met for about three hours at the commissioner's office,
discussing ancillary matters in an attempt to re-establish dialogue
with the sides at opposite extremes on the issues of a payroll tax
and revenue sharing. The groups will take today off and reconvene
Monday, a management spokesman said.</LD>
<LD>   Talks are stalled on the tax owners deem necessary to restrain
player salaries. The union has agreed to the concept of a tax, but
has proposed a much higher tax threshold and lower tax rate than
owners will accept.</LD>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Texas Ranger owner Tom Hicks, who gave shortstop Alex
Rodriguez a record 10-year, $252-million contract, preached the need
for fiscal responsibility.</TE>
<TE>   "I think a majority of owners, including me, would probably like
to have even stronger cost containment than we're talking about right
now," Hicks told the Dallas Morning News. "We need to fix baseball
and not just have another Band-Aid solution."</TE>
<TE>   After the 1994 strike, owners and players agreed to a luxury tax
for the 1997, '98 and '99 seasons. However, many owners considered
the previous tax formula ineffective.</TE>
<TE>   In this negotiation, management has proposed a tax of 37.5% to 50%
on the portion of payrolls above $102 million. The union has offered
a 15% to 30% tax to start on payrolls above $130 million.</TE>

<KH>LITTLE LEAGUE WORLD SERIES</KH>
<HD>It's a Power Display for Harlem, 9-3</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Jeremy Lopez urged his cousin Javier to join his Little League team
this summer. Good thing he did, because the two make a potent pair
for Harlem, N.Y.</LD>
<LD>   Jeremy Lopez hit two home runs, including a grand slam, and Javier
hit a two-run homer as Harlem beat Clemmons, N.C., 9-3, Saturday in
the opening game for both teams at the Little League World Series at
South Williamsport, Pa.</LD>
<LD>   Leading off in the third inning, Jeremy Lopez sent the first pitch
over the wall in center field to give Harlem a 3-0 lead. In the
fourth, he hit a pitch over the wall in left.</LD>
<TE>   Jeremy was three for three with a walk. He singled to lead off the
sixth and scored when cousin Javier hit a 240-foot home run to the
hedge behind the center-field wall. Andrew Diaz had a two-run homer.</TE>
<TE>   "This was beyond my expectations today in terms of how the bats
were working," Harlem Manager Morris McWilliams said. "The bats just
came alive."</TE>
<TE>   Harlem received by far the most attention of any team before the
tournament, because of accusations that the team used players from
outside its district. But Little League exonerated the team earlier
this week, saying all the players had complied with the rules.</TE>
<TE>   Javier Lopez also pitched for Harlem, striking out 10 to earn the
win. Alex Robinson (0-1) took the loss for Clemmons.</TE>
<TE>   In other games, Louisville, Ky., beat Aptos, Calif., 4-1;
Worcester, Mass., beat Webb City, Mo., 2-1; Venezuela beat Guam,
11-1; Japan beat Russia, 7-0; and Netherlands Antilles, beat Mexico,
10-1.</TE>
<TE>   The championship game is next Sunday.</TE>

<LD>Stretched out to 550 yards on June 30, Solar Dash scored a victory in
the Avison Handicap for owner-trainer Adan Farias.</LD>
<LD>   A 4-year-old gelded son of A Classic Dash, Solar Dash will try for
another victory at the seldom-run distance in tonight's feature, a
$12,550 allowance.</LD>
<LD>   The California-bred will have five opponents, including Butter Me
Up CST, who is shortening up after four consecutive starts at 870
yards. Owned by Sergio Gonzalez and trained by Felix Gonzalez, the
6-year-old gelding was third behind Sign Of Lanty in an allowance
race on July 14. He has won 11 of 39 and banked over $140,000.</LD>
<TE>   Completing the field in the eighth race are Strawfly Ta Lou, Azure
Classic Dash, Nordick Only VM and Old Easy Money.</TE>
<TE>   Like Butter Me Up CST, Azure Classic Dash is cutting back after
running in seven 870-yard races in a row while Strawfly Ta Lou,
Nordick Only VM and Old Easy Money have been going shorter. The
latter two are trained by Jaime Gomez.</TE>
<TE>   The picks: 1. Just Take It Easy. 2. Ja Runaway Dash. 3. Something
Speshel. 4. This Wins For You. 5. Errli Melodi. 6. EG Special Ways.
7. Wynhurst. 8. Solar Dash. 9. Apollo Dash.</TE>
<TE>   Four! Use Just Take It Easy, Rhymer and Scooter New Moon in the
first, single Ja Runaway Dash in the second, use the Sey Ella
Proof-Sey Reign Proof entry and Something Speshel in the third and
all in the fourth.</TE>
<TE>   Shots in the dark: Fantome CS adds Lasix in a weak race in the
fifth. Snow Shake is a firster debuting for a sharp barn (Adan
Farias) in the ninth.</TE>

<LD>Check Him Out, at 5-1, finished strongly to win the $207,800 Golden
State Derby by nearly a length Saturday night at Los Alamitos.</LD>
<LD>   Ridden by Sam Thompson for a partnership that includes trainer
Blane Schvaneveldt, the 3-year-old son of the thoroughbred sire
Hennessy dominated to end a three-race losing streak.</LD>
<LD>   This wasn't the first time Check Him Out had scored an upset in a
Grade I. Last year, when trained by Laura Lukas and owned in part by
her husband Wayne, the California-bred won the Ed Burke Memorial
Futurity at 8-1.</LD>
<TE>   In winning for the sixth time in 14 starts, Check Him Out
completed the 400 yards in 19.67 seconds and improved upon his

finished third behind A Tac First, the fastest qualifier who finished
second Saturday night, and Winners Want Cash, part of an entry along

difference," said Thompson, who collected his second Golden State
victory in four years after taking the 1999 renewal with IBA Dasher.</TE>
<TE>   "He minded his manners tonight. I think he's as nice a 3-year-old
as there is in the country. He beat a lot of nice ones in this race."</TE>

<TE>*--*
If baseball players strike Aug. 30, it could block players and teams
from achievements (statistics are through Saturday's games):
* The Minnesota Twins, a team baseball tried to fold in the
off-season, hold the largest division lead in the American League (13
1/2 games in the Central) and are headed for their first postseason
appearance since 1991
* Barry Bonds reached 600 home runs this month. Because he's 38, any
games lost would hinder his chances to reach Hank Aaron's career
record of 755. With a .358 average, two points ahead of Larry Walker,
Bonds also has a chance at his first National League batting
championship
* A strike could cut short Cub slugger Sammy Sosa's bid to become the
first hitter to reach 50 home runs for five seasons (he has 43). He's
also trying to reach 500 home runs for his career (he has 493)
* Atlanta's John Smoltz and the Dodgers' Eric Gagne are past 40 saves
and could threaten the major league record of 57, set by Bobby
Thigpen with the Chicago White Sox in 1990. Smoltz leads the majors
with 43 saves, Gagne has 42
* Alfonso Soriano is trying to become the first second baseman to
join the 40-homer, 40-stolen base club. He has 30 home runs and 34
stolen bases for the Yankees
* With 185 home runs through Saturday's game at Seattle, the Yankees
are on pace to break the club record of 240 homers (set in 1961)
* The Angels, bidding for their first postseason berth since 1986,
are leading the AL wild-card race and are a half-game behind Seattle
in the AL West
* Randy Johnson is trying for a fifth consecutive 300-strikeout
season. He has 251
* Ichiro Suzuki is trying for a second consecutive 200-hit season. He
has 169
* The Arizona Diamondbacks would be unable to defend their World
Series championship
* The Atlanta Braves, leading the NL East by 19 1/2 games, would have
to wait until next year to try to add to their record 10 consecutive
division championships. The only time since 1990 that the Braves
failed to win their division was 1994--when a strike ended the season
early</TE>

<HD>Waltrip Wins Another Busch Race</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Michael Waltrip held off a strong challenge from Todd Bodine before
pulling away to win the NASCAR Busch Series race Saturday at Michigan
International Speedway in Brooklyn, Mich.</LD>
<LD>   The victory in the Cabela's 250 was the ninth in Busch competition
for Winston Cup driver Waltrip, and his first since October 1999.</LD>
<LD>   "It's a lot of fun when you win," Waltrip said.</LD>
<TE>   Jeff Burton finished second, nearly four seconds back, and Jeff
Green edged Bodine for third to give Winston Cup drivers a sweep of
the top four spots.</TE>
<TE>   Bodine, in a Chevrolet, appeared to have the fastest car for most
of 125-lap race but dropped to 10th after a four-tire pit stop on lap
79 during the fourth caution.</TE>
<TE>   Waltrip, who changed only two tires on his Chevy during that
caution, took the lead from Joe Nemechek with 38 laps to go and began
pulling away.</TE>
<TE>   But Bodine charged through the field and caught Waltrip, pulling
beside the leader on several occasions. The cars touched in Turn 2 on
lap 103 and when they got to the front stretch later during that lap,
Waltrip pulled down and slammed into Bodine.</TE>
<TE>   The contact damaged Bodine's right-front fender and kept him from
challenging again.</TE>
<TE>   "He ran into me in Turn 2, and that's not how you pass the
leader," Waltrip said.</TE>
<TE>   "I waited until he got to my door, and I turned into him and tried
to cave his fender in to make him push. I don't know if worked or
not."</TE>
<TE>   When told it apparently worked, Waltrip said, "I'm glad, he
deserved it."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   After Bruno Junqueira hit the wall on his final qualifying lap, a
smile seemed to leave his face for the first time since his arrival
at Road America in Elkhart Lake, Minn.</TE>
<TE>   But it didn't take long for the smile to return.</TE>
<TE>   "I just love this place," the defending race champion said after
nipping CART series leader Cristiano da Matta for the pole for
today's Motorola 220, despite the crash.</TE>
<TE>   Just like Friday, it came down to the final few moments of the
60-minute qualifying session, with Junqueira and fellow Brazilian da
Matta battling for the top spot.</TE>
<TE>   Da Matta, trying to end a three-race mini-slump, started the
session on the provisional pole after a lap of 1 minute 42.640
seconds at 141.980 mph.</TE>
<TE>   While da Matta was unable to improve on that lap, Junqueira went
gunning for his childhood friend and finally knocked him off the top
spot only one minute from the end with a lap of 1:42.151 at 142.659.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Martin Championship Auto Racing Teams announced an
expanded Entrant Support Program in which it will provide an
additional $400,000 to each of 20 cars entered in the 2003 season,
bringing incentives up to $850,000 in total cash payments.</TE>
<TE>   To offset the costs, each team will be mandated to make space
available on its car for associate sponsors found by CART.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Rubens Barrichello edged Ferrari teammate Michael Schumacher to
claim the pole for the Hungarian Grand Prix at Budapest.</TE>
<TE>   Schumacher, the five-time Formula One champion who is seeking a
record 10th victory of the season today, had dominated the practice
sessions. But Barrichello was quicker in the qualifying.</TE>
<TE>   Barrichello, who had spun out in his first run, had a fast lap of
1 minute 13.333 seconds on the 2.47-mile Hungaroring circuit for his
third pole of the season and sixth of his career.</TE>
<TE>   Schumacher, who has won nine of 12 races this season and clinched
his record-tying fifth title last month, finished .071 seconds behind
his teammate.</TE>
<TE>   Passing is virtually impossible on the tight circuit, and starting
from the pole is a huge advantage in the 77-lap race.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Rip Michels of Mission Hills swept the Jani-King Super Late Model
series twin 50-lap races at Irwindale Speedway in front of 5,422.</TE>
<TE>   In the first race, Michels was second behind Tony Green with less
than five laps to go when Green's right front tire blew, sending
Green sliding along the walls of turns one and two. On the restart,
Michels held off Tony Bruncati and Brandon Loverock for the win.</TE>
<TE>   In the second race, Michels, who started on the pole, easily went
wire-to-wire for the victory, this time holding off Tim Woods III and
Bruncati for the second win.</TE>
<TE>   The victories, combined with Green's accident, catapulted Michels
into the lead for the championship title with 602 points, with
Loverock second and Green in third.</TE>
<TE>   In the 50-lap Southern California Auto Club main event, Tim
Huddleston earned his first win in four races by overtaking Todd
Burns with five laps to go to win his sixth of the season.</TE>
<TE>   In the 40-lap Vista Paint Super Stock series, Andrew Phipps
claimed his fourth consecutive win of the season, holding off Darren
Cheek for most of the race.</TE>

<HD>Blake Gets Past Agassi in Washington Semifinals</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>James Blake upset top-seeded Andre Agassi, 6-3, 6-4, Saturday night
to reach the championship of the Legg Mason Tennis Classic at
Washington.</LD>
<LD>   Blake will play Paradorn Srichaphan, who defeated Marcelo Rios,
3-6, 6-2, 6-2, in the other semifinal.</LD>
<LD>   One day after falling behind 3-0 in both the first and second sets
against Alex Corretja before rallying, Blake broke Agassi in the
second game of the match on his way to a 3-0 lead. From that point,
Blake hit winner after winner--25 in all--to overpower Agassi from
the baseline.</LD>
<TE>   Agassi, who came back from a set down Friday night to beat Thomas
Enqvist, didn't show much fight against Blake in the second set.
Agassi's serve was broken twice in the set's first three games, and
Blake went ahead, 4-0.</TE>
<TE>   Agassi tried to mount a late comeback, breaking Blake's serve to
get within 5-3, but Blake held his serve and took the match with a
forehand winner.</TE>
<TE>   The 14th-seeded Srichaphan, who upset Agassi in the second round
at Wimbledon this year, made it a day of upsets in the first
semifinal.</TE>
<TE>   Srichaphan, who had 18 unforced errors in the first set, broke
Rios twice in the second and three times in the third to reach his
first final in the United States.</TE>
<TE>   The fifth-seeded Rios broke twice in the first set. He won 28
points in the opening set, but only 30 points in the final two sets.
Srichaphan lost only one point on serve in the second set.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Jennifer Capriati reached the final of the Rogers AT&amp;T Cup in
Montreal when Jelena Dokic retired because of a knee injury while
trailing in the second set.</TE>
<TE>   Capriati was ahead, 7-6 (5), 4-0, when Dokic told the chair umpire
she couldn't continue in the hard-court tuneup for the U.S. Open,
which starts Aug. 26.</TE>
<TE>   The second-seeded Capriati will face seventh-seeded Amelie
Mauresmo, a 6-2, 7-6 (3) winner over eighth-seeded Daniela
Hantuchova.</TE>
<TE>   Capriati won the tournament at 15 in 1991, and was the runner-up
last year in Toronto.</TE>
<TE>   Dokic, seeded third, had the trainer work on her knee while
trailing, 3-0, in the second set. Back on the court five minutes
later, she barely moved while losing a service game.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Greg Rusedski defeated another top player in the RCA Championships
at Indianapolis, reaching the final with a 3-6, 6-3, 6-3 victory over
third-seeded Tommy Haas.</TE>
<TE>   Rusedski, seeded 14th, will face unseeded Felix Mantilla, a 6-4,
1-6, 6-4 winner over ninth-seeded Rainer Schuettler, in the other
semifinal.</TE>
<TE>   Ranked 41st in the ATP Entry System, Rusedski beat top-seeded
Lleyton Hewitt on Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   Rusedski made his move in the second set, breaking Haas' serve in
the eighth game for a 5-3 lead. Haas, troubled by pain in his right
elbow, double-faulted twice in the game and 10 times in the match.
Rusedski had only three double-faults.</TE>
<TE>   Golf</TE>
<TE>   The forecast calls for thunderstorms and gusting wind. That was
enough to put a smile on the face of Scotland's Catriona Matthew.</TE>
<TE>   "I grew up playing in pretty windy weather," she said after her
third consecutive two-under-par 70 gave her a one-shot lead over Meg
Mallon (69) in the Canadian Women's Open at Vaudreuil-Dorion, Quebec.</TE>
<TE>   Se Ri Pak (68), Gloria Park (73) and Michelle Ellis (73) were
three strokes back at three under, and Karrie Webb (72) and Charlotta
Sorenstam (70) followed at two under.</TE>
<TE>   Matthew took the lead by making birdie putts of 25 feet and 12
feet on her final two holes to move to six-under 210.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Becky Lucida of Poway won the U.S. Women's Amateur at Scarborough,
N.Y., building a six-hole lead in the morning round and holding off
Brandi Jackson of Belton, S.C., 3 and 2, in the 36-hole final.</TE>
<TE>   Lucida, who will be a senior at USC, never trailed in the 121
holes she played in six matches on the Sleepy Hollow Country Club
course. She won the Robert Cox Cup and earned a spot in the 2003 U.S.
Women's Open.</TE>
<TE>   "I've never won any college events," Lucida said. "But there will
be an obscene amount of confidence when I return to school. I'm
already thinking about next year's U.S. Women's Open."</TE>
<TE>   Basketball</TE>
<TE>   Predrag Stojakovic of the Sacramento Kings scored 26 points to
lead Yugoslavia past Dirk Nowitzki and Germany, 88-87, in double
overtime at the SuperCup in Braunschweig, Germany, a tuneup
tournament for the World Championships.</TE>
<TE>   Nowitzki, the Dallas Maverick forward, scored 25 points, including
a three-point basket with 2.2 seconds left in regulation to send the
game to overtime.</TE>
<TE>   Yugoslavia and Germany finished the round-robin event with 2-1
records. Yugoslavia won because of the head-to-head victory.</TE>
<TE>   Stojakovic will lead Yugoslavia as it tries to defend its title at
the World Championships, which start Aug. 29 in Indianapolis.</TE>

<LD>Injury-plagued running back Terrell Davis of the Denver Broncos has
decided to retire after seven seasons rather than go through another

<LD>   Agent Neil Schwartz said doctors told Davis they could not
guarantee that his latest ailment--a degenerative condition in his
left knee--would improve.</LD>
<LD>   Davis will be put on injured reserve Tuesday, allowing fans to see
him in uniform one last time Monday night, when the Broncos face the
San Francisco 49ers.</LD>

<HD>Bonds Gets a Break, but Marlins Win, 7-3</HD>

<LD>Barry Bonds' latest home run wasn't as memorable as the one before,
but it was the hot topic after the Florida Marlins beat the San
Francisco Giants, 7-3, Saturday night at Pro Player Stadium in Miami.
The broken-bat shot was his first home run since becoming the fourth
player to reach the 600-homer milestone Aug. 9.</LD>
<LD>   He slowly jogged to first with the handle as he watched No. 601
barely clear the fence in the first inning. He dropped the handle at
first, stared at the barrel that landed near the bag and then smiled
widely as he began his home-run trot.</LD>
<LD>   It was his 34th homer of the season but may have been his most
improbable ever.</LD>
<TE>   "I don't think anyone has [homered] with a bat that exploded,"
Bonds said.</TE>
<TE>   He also walked three times, moving past Joe Morgan and into sole
possession of fourth place on the all-time list with 1,867. Ted
Williams is third with 2,019 walks.</TE>
<TE>   The Marlins have walked Bonds six times in two games, continuing
to pitch around him. Even on the home run, rookie right-hander Josh
Beckett threw his 2-0 fastball down and away--exactly where he wanted
it.</TE>
<TE>   "It was the only well-located pitch I threw him all night. It must
have looked like a beach ball to him," Beckett said.</TE>
<TE>   "We wanted it down, we got it down but he got it out," Marlin
Manager Jeff Torborg said. "He's scary strong, he really is. A lot of
hitting coaches talk about getting extension, but that's ridiculous.
The head of the bat went almost as far as the ball. The more you
think about it, the more amazing it is."</TE>
<TE>   St. Louis 5, Philadelphia 1--Scott Rolen, playing his second game
in Philadelphia since being traded to the Cardinals on July 29, was
greeted by boos from the Veterans Stadium crowd of 20,242 each time
he came to the plate. But he responded with a two-run double to help
end the Phillies' five-game winning streak.</TE>
<TE>   Houston 6, Cincinnati 1--Jose Vizcaino went five for five,
including a leadoff home run and a go-ahead single in the ninth
inning at Cincinnati.</TE>
<TE>   The Astros' late burst gave the win to Roy Oswalt (15-6), who won
his fifth consecutive start.</TE>
<TE>   After Vizcaino homered in the first off newly acquired Shawn
Estes, Cincinnati got a run in the second when Barry Larkin grounded
into a double play. It stayed 1-1 through eight innings.</TE>
<TE>   San Diego 6, Montreal 5--Pinch-hitter Gene Kingsale's two-run
double capped a four-run eighth inning at Montreal and the Padres set
a major league record for pitchers used in a season.</TE>
<TE>   Reliever Jonathan Johnson (1-0), whose contract was purchased from
triple-A Portland earlier in the day, became the 33rd pitcher to
appear in a game for San Diego this season. The Padres broke
Cleveland's record of 32 pitchers in the 2000 season.</TE>
<TE>   Pittsburgh 5, Milwaukee 0--Jack Wilson hit a three-run double in
the bottom of the sixth inning to help Brian Meadows win for the
first time in more than a year as the Pirates ended a seven-game
losing streak. Meadows (1-3) gave up four hits in six innings to win
for the first time since May 10, 2001, when he beat Cleveland while
he was with Kansas City.</TE>
<TE>   Colorado 10, Atlanta 3--Todd Zeile capped the Rockies' five-run
first inning with his first homer in seven weeks. Jay Payton, who had
a two-run double in the big first inning at Turner Field, added a
solo homer in the third, his first with Colorado since being acquired
in a trade from the Mets on July 31.</TE>

<HD>Arizona Slams Door on Hapless Cubs</HD>
<DH>Baseball: Diamondbacks take advantage of Chicago's mistakes
in 6-2 win. Sosa ties Gehrig with 493rd homer.</DH>

<DL>CHICAGO</DL>
<LD>Seeing Erubiel Durazo break a tie with a grand slam in the ninth
inning was bad enough for Chicago Cub fans Saturday at Wrigley Field.</LD>
<LD>   But watching the Cubs run themselves out of a rally in the bottom
of the inning was too much.</LD>
<LD>   "Go on strike! Go on strike!" the crowd of 38,728 chanted as the
Arizona Diamondbacks beat the Cubs, 6-2.</LD>
<TE>   When pinch-runner Joe Girardi's baserunning error caused Alex
Gonzalez to get caught in a rundown between third and home, the
chants started.</TE>
<TE>   The victory was Arizona's eighth in a row. The Diamondbacks have
also won nine consecutive road games.</TE>
<TE>   The Cubs' Sammy Sosa hit his major league-leading 43rd homer. It
was the 493rd of his career, tying Lou Gehrig for 18th place on the
all-time list.</TE>
<TE>   In the ninth, Arizona's Quinton McCracken and Junior Spivey
singled with two out. Steve Finley followed with a grounder to
shortstop that Gonzalez misplayed for an error, loading the bases.</TE>
<TE>   Durazo hit the first pitch from Kyle Farnsworth (3-5) over the
center-field fence.</TE>
<TE>   Mike Fetters (2-0) got the victory after striking out Sosa and
Fred McGriff in the eighth.</TE>
<TE>   The Cubs tried to rally in the ninth, hitting three consecutive
singles before Girardi, running for Todd Hundley, made his
baserunning blunder. It was one of three poor baserunning decisions
made by the Cubs.</TE>
<TE>   "The runner has to make sure the runner goes home there, but I'm
not going to single out too much today because, to be honest with
you, we just played a bad ballgame today," Cub interim Manager Bruce
Kimm said.</TE>

<HD>Tua Stops Moorer in 30 Seconds</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>ATLANTIC CITY, N.J.</DL>
<LD>Everyone knew David Tua had power. On Saturday night, Michael Moorer
quickly found out just how much.</LD>
<LD>   The 29-year-old Samoan powerhouse embarrassed the two-time former
heavyweight champion, stopping him 30 seconds into their scheduled
10-rounder.</LD>
<LD>   Attacking immediately after the opening bell, Tua, 243, backed
Moorer into the ropes and hit him in the head with a hard left.</LD>
<TE>   Moorer, 224, backed away and was on the ropes on the other side
when Tua (41-3) delivered a crushing right to the chin and a left to
the back of the head.</TE>
<TE>   Moorer (43-3-1) sank into a crouch, dazed, as referee Rudy Battle
waved a halt to the fight. Tua made $500,000. Moorer's share was
$425,000.</TE>
<TE>   On the undercard, unbeaten middleweight Jermain Taylor, a bronze
medalist at the 2000 Olympics, won his 11th consecutive bout, posting
a unanimous 10-round decision over Sam Hill.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Undefeated Joe Calzaghe of Wales successfully defended his WBO
super-middleweight title at Cardiff, Wales, with a unanimous decision
over Miguel Jimenez of Puerto Rico. Calzaghe improved to 34-0.</TE>

<LD>The national cry of anguish went up Friday from baseball fans
outraged that players dared to set an Aug. 30 strike date. Fans are
disillusioned by the possibility of the second strike in eight years
and enraged that neither owners nor players appear to place a higher
priority on playing games than fighting over money. From peanut
vendors to President Bush, fans told both sides to shut up and settle
their dispute now, to act in the best interests of the sport. Those
sentiments evoke a chuckle from Barry Axelrod, a longtime player
agent from Encinitas. He can sympathize, to be sure. But he looks at
baseball's perfect record--in the last 30 years, no labor agreement
has been reached without a players' strike or owners' lockout--and
suggests fans might be wasting their breath. "I have never seen
either of these sides care one iota about the court of public
opinion," he said. "That's indicated by what we've done the past 30
years." For fans numb to the sights or sounds of Commissioner Bud
Selig and union leader Donald Fehr, and for fans lost in a sea of tax
thresholds, local revenues and split-pool vs. straight-pool revenue
sharing, The Times spoke with two Southern California baseball
figures not involved in the current negotiations and asked them to
discuss the issue fundamental to each side.</LD>
<LD>   *</LD>
<TE>   Richard Brown served as president of the Angels from 1990-96. He
returned to practicing law after Disney bought the team. In April,
Los Angeles Mayor James Hahn appointed him to the city's planning
commission. Brown is an advisor to Alabama businessman Donald
Watkins, who is interested in buying the Angels.</TE>
<TE>   From a management point of view, Brown said, the issue is simple.</TE>
<TE>   "The most critical thing is to get salaries in line," he said.
"They need to get a reasonable compensation structure."</TE>
<TE>   Commissioner Selig testified before Congress in December that
owners lost a combined $350 million last season and that only nine of
30 teams turned a profit.</TE>
<TE>   According to the figures Selig presented, 10 teams spent at least
two-thirds of total revenues on player salaries and benefits, not
counting revenue sharing. Five of those 10 teams--the Dodgers,
Atlanta, Arizona, Boston and Texas--then paid out additional money in
revenue sharing.</TE>
<TE>   "The reason teams are unprofitable is because salaries amount to
70% of gross revenue in some cases," Brown said. "There is no
business I'm aware of in this country where salaries take up such a
great percentage of gross revenue."</TE>
<TE>   The most logical solution to that dilemma is a salary cap tied to
revenues--that is, player salaries account for a fixed percentage of
revenues each season, with players making more money as teams take in
more money.</TE>
<TE>   While NFL players and owners agreed to such a system, the major
league players' union adamantly opposes any salary cap. The union
believes that teams and players ought to be able to negotiate deals
for whatever salary they agree on, without restrictions, in the same
way that a company can hire a salesman for whatever salary the
parties agree on.</TE>
<TE>   The union argument in favor of a free market is flawed with
respect to salary arbitration, where a third party--the
arbitrator--can determine a player's salary. The threat of a hearing
compels teams to offer more money than they might like, lest the
arbitrator award the player an even higher salary. Players are not
eligible for arbitration until after they have played three years in
the major leagues, and until then teams can pay whatever they like
above the major league minimum wage. After six years, players are
eligible for free agency and can negotiate with any team.</TE>
<TE>   Owners have failed in every previous attempt to implement a salary
cap and have acknowledged that the union never would accept one. In
its place, they have proposed increased revenue sharing and a luxury
tax, with the objective of providing more money to lower-revenue
teams and with the more important objective to restrain spending
among higher-revenue teams.</TE>
<TE>   "They desperately need a luxury tax," Brown said.</TE>
<TE>   The luxury tax would not have prevented the New York Yankees from
spending $17 million per year on first baseman Jason Giambi last
winter, but it could have slapped them with a tax as high as $8.5
million per year, forcing teams to think twice before spending so
freely.</TE>
<TE>   Players reluctantly accepted the concept but initially proposed
that the tax not kick in until a team's payroll was so high that only
the Yankees would be affected, or so owners believed.</TE>
<TE>   The owners prefer to call the luxury tax a "competitive balance
tax," citing studies that show the teams that pay the most tend to
win the most and concluding that the lesser the disparity in
payrolls, the greater the chance for more teams to win.</TE>
<TE>   The union, skeptical of management claims of huge financial
losses, suggests that its free-market approach allows owners to pay
what they like. Players often say that no one forces an owner to pay
huge salaries.</TE>
<TE>   But, Brown said, "If you lower salaries so you can become more
financially viable, the team is not as competitive. If you're not
competitive, the fans don't show up, the media burns you, and the
broadcast rights contracts are worth substantially less."</TE>
<TE>   Players typically respond that owners, often blessed with fortunes
from successful business ventures, would not spend money if they
could not afford to do so.</TE>
<TE>   "All the people who say, 'They wouldn't pay that money if they
didn't have it' have never heard of a credit card?" Brown said.
"Owners have done the same thing with lines of credit, and now they
have maxed out."</TE>

<HD>Leonard Has the Wind and Woods at His Back</HD>
<DH>Golf: Former British Open champion leads Beem by three and
Tiger by five after three rounds at PGA.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRIS DUFRESNE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>CHASKA, Minn.</DL>
<LD>Trying to find something Tiger Woods hasn't done in golf is about as
tough as finding Phil Mickelson's name on a major championship
trophy, but consider this statistic provided by the bureau of birdies
and bogeys:</LD>
<LD>   Woods has never come from behind after three rounds to win a
professional major championship, yet that's the challenge he faces
today in the final round of the 84th PGA Championship.</LD>
<LD>   On a day when the wind blew so hard at Hazeltine National Golf
Club it played more like AuGUSTa, Justin Leonard shot three-under-par
69 Saturday to go nine-under 207 through 54 holes and takes a
three-shot lead into today's final round.</LD>
<TE>   Rich Beem, who was part of a five-way tie for the lead after the
second round, shot even-par 72 and is three shots back at 210,
followed by Fred Funk at five-under 211, followed by Mark
Calcavecchia and Woods, five shots behind at 212.</TE>
<TE>   Woods' quest for his ninth major title, and his third this season,
is still in play, yet his nickname in majors has never been the
Comeback Kid.</TE>
<TE>   Woods either led or shared the lead after 54 holes in all of his
eight major titles and he has never finished second. For what it's
worth, Jack Nicklaus finished second 19 times.</TE>
<TE>   Woods' general pattern at big events has been to get the lead and
hold on or fade out of contention before the final round.</TE>
<TE>   Exceptions? Woods trailed Payne Stewart by two shots entering the
final round of the 1999 U.S. Open and finished third.</TE>
<TE>   Woods was five behind at the 1998 British Open, fired a
final-round 66, but missed making the playoff by one shot.</TE>
<TE>   Can Woods do here what he has never done before?</TE>
<TE>   "Yeah," he said flatly.</TE>
<TE>   Woods will have to draw inspiration from his amateur days. In
1994, he came from six holes down with 11 to play to defeat Trip
Kuehne at the U.S. Amateur championship.</TE>
<TE>   That was match play, of course, and the players got to wear
shorts.</TE>
<TE>   Today, Woods, in slacks, must track down Justin Leonard, a great
wind player who won the British Open in 1997.</TE>
<TE>   "There's only a few guys ahead of me," Woods said. "I just need to
go out there and play solid."</TE>
<TE>   Woods said he was going to play it safe today, though Leonard
isn't buying it.</TE>
<TE>   "You know Tiger is going to go out and shoot at the pins," Leonard
said.</TE>
<TE>   Saturday's third round did not quite measure up to the brutal
third round at this year's British Open, yet wind gusts of 40 mph did
make par a good score.</TE>
<TE>   Woods shot even-par 72 and was almost giddy.</TE>
<TE>   His day started with an early wakeup call and then a wallop, as
Woods first had to play the last two holes of his second round,
bumped into Saturday because of weather.</TE>
<TE>   After hitting into a fairway bunker on the par-four 18th, Woods
laced a 200-yard three-iron to the heart of the green and then made
birdie to finish at four under, only two shots off the lead.</TE>
<TE>   Woods' third-round wind strategy was to play it safe, and he made
good on that promise by making 11 consecutive pars before making
birdie on the par-five 11th hole.</TE>
<TE>   A player who normally dominates the competition with his play at
par-fives, Woods has played the long holes this week at only four
under.</TE>
<TE>   Woods made a dramatic par save at the par-four 16th hole after
jerking a nine-iron left of the green. His chip out of the rough was
poor, but Woods made up for it by rolling in a 30-foot putt.</TE>
<TE>   Woods thrust his hand into the air after the make, which kept him
within three shots of the lead, yet he lost momentum on the 18th with
his lone bogey of the day.</TE>
<TE>   Woods' errant tee shot ended up near a white picket fence next to
a corporate tent, but after making a brilliant recovery shot to the
fringe, Woods hit only an average chip and missed his par putt.</TE>
<TE>   "Any time you end with a bogey, it's always disappointing," Woods
said.</TE>
<TE>   Especially the way Leonard was closing, which was fast.</TE>
<TE>   While Woods was speaking to reporters in the media tent, Leonard
was wrapping up his 69, the best round of the day.</TE>
<TE>   After playing the front in even-par 36, Leonard scorched the back
in three-under 33, making birdies No. 10, 15 and 16.</TE>
<TE>   If you look at it logically, today's final round could come down
to a Leonard-Woods showdown on the back nine.</TE>
<TE>   Both have won major titles in tough conditions.</TE>
<TE>   At the time Leonard won his British Open, he and Woods were tied
for major titles with one apiece.</TE>
<TE>   Much has changed since.</TE>
<TE>   "When you look at who has won majors in the last five years, since
'97 at Royal Troon, there's probably one player that really sticks
out," Leonard said. "So, yeah, I would say it's a lot more difficult
to win majors than it was five or six years ago."</TE>
<TE>   Beem is only three shots back, yet he might not have enough
Pepto-Bismol to calm his stomach today.</TE>
<TE>   "Instead of one swig, I'll probably take a couple of them and I'll
probably do it in the locker room so nobody sees how big a swig,"
Beem said, "but I think it's going to be more than one."</TE>
<TE>   Beem's game held up wonderfully under pressure Saturday--his
even-par 72 matching Woods' round--yet you wonder how long he can
keep his knees from knocking.</TE>
<TE>   Even Beem wonders.</TE>
<TE>   He has only two wins on the PGA Tour and started to wilt a bit
near the end Saturday with bogeys on No. 14 and No. 17, which dropped
him from eight under to six.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't discount the fact I can play with these guys," Beem said,
"but to win a major, you have to have something special, and I don't
know if I have it."</TE>
<TE>   Fred Funk? He's 46, and has never won a major. He had to play five
holes to finish his second round early Saturday, started the third
round tied for the lead, thanks to a spectacular hole-out on No. 7,
and ended it four back after his shaky, one-over 73.</TE>
<TE>   The gallery has clearly taken to Funk--"It's a Funk Fest out there
or something," he said--and he has already had a week to remember.</TE>
<TE>   But as to actually winning?</TE>
<TE>   "It would be an incredible thing," he said. "I wouldn't need to do
anything else.... I couldn't even put words on it."</TE>
<TE>   Calcavecchia, 42, won the 1989 British Open but hasn't sniffed the
leaderboard in a major this year until now.</TE>
<TE>   He started the day in the five-way tie at six under, but his
two-over 74 left him five shots back and listing a bit.</TE>
<TE>   "I'll regroup," Calcavecchia said. "Five back, though, is a long
way. Justin is playing some very good golf."</TE>

<HD>Everything's Nice but Mickelson's Scores</HD>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>CHASKA, Minn.</DL>
<LD>What are 76, 72, 78? They are not the three numbers before the
quarterback says "hike." They are Phil Mickelson's scores for the
first three rounds of the PGA Championship, a 54-hole total of
10-over 226.</LD>
<LD>   Mickelson is tied for 63rd and that's certainly not what was
expected from one of the players expected to contend in the PGA
Championship.</LD>
<LD>   Mickelson shot a 41 on the front, beginning with four consecutive
bogeys. Afterward, Mickelson was at a loss to explain what is going
wrong with him.</LD>
<TE>   "I'm just not playing well," he said. "I don't know what else to
say. There's no one to blame, other than myself. The course couldn't
be any better, the people couldn't be nicer.</TE>
<TE>   "I just haven't played well. That's the bottom line."</TE>
<TE>   Mickelson was far from being the only player who struggled in the
wind. Matt Gogel shot 83, Thomas Levet 82, Tom Watson 83 and David
Duval 76.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The third-round scoring average of 75.878 was the highest in PGA
Championship history. Because of the conditions, tournament officials
moved the tees up on the par four, 406-yard 16th, which played into
the wind. Tiger Woods lauded the decision.</TE>
<TE>   "I think if they would have kept it all the way back there, some
of the guys might not have gotten over the water, as hard as the
wind's blowing," he said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Ernie Els, the British Open champion, shot a three-over 75 and
said the blustery wind turned the third round into a survival test.</TE>
<TE>   "If you are shooting even par today, I think you would have been
happy with your score," he said. "Anything under 74 is not too bad."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The cut was finally made after the second round was officially
completed Saturday morning and 72 players made it at four-over 148.
Among those who didn't were defending champion David Toms, Nick
Price, Paul Azinger, Mark O'Meara, John Daly, and Jesper Parnevik.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Weather report: The rainfall Friday night and Saturday morning at
Hazeltine was measured at three inches. According to the forecasters,
the temperature today is supposed to reach 75 degrees--with no rain.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The top two shots of the day didn't even come in the third
round--they were instead accomplished by Fred Funk and Woods to end
the second round.</TE>
<TE>   On his second shot at the 18th hole, Woods faced a difficult
bunker shot with a downhill, side-hill lie, trees in front of him and
a nasty crosswind. With a three-iron, Woods lofted the ball over the
trees and stopped the ball on the green about 20 feet from the hole.
He made the putt for an unlikely, or at least unexpected, birdie.</TE>
<TE>   Said Woods: "It was one of the all-time best shots that I've had."</TE>
<TE>   As for Funk, his dramatics came at the par-five seventh (his 16th
hole) when he was in the green-side rough after his third shot, about
20 yards from the hole. Funk lofted the ball in the air and it
slam-dunked straight into the hole.</TE>
<TE>   Said Funk: "I hit it harder than I wanted to, but obviously, it
turned out really good."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Greg Norman is years past his prime and not considered a factor at
majors anymore, yet he still thinks he has a chance every time he
shows up.</TE>
<TE>   Norman shot one-over 73 on Saturday and is two-over 218 after 54
holes, 11 shots back of Justin Leonard.</TE>
<TE>   "In fact, I'm very disappointed, to tell you the truth," he said.
"I thought I had a good chance to finish one or two under, and I
figured that would have been right in there. I had played well enough
to do that. I really walked away with nothing out of the round."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Woods knows how to protect a lead on the last day of major, but
what's he going to do today if he has to play catch-up on the back
nine?</TE>
<TE>   Woods says he will not change his game plan if he is trailing.</TE>
<TE>   "What hole can you be aggressive on?" Woods said. "There really
isn't. You've just got to keep plugging along and give yourself putts
at it."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   It appeared for a moment that Rich Beem might have to take a
two-stroke penalty after using his cap to wipe clean his line near
the 15th green, but Beem insists he was in the clear.</TE>
<TE>   "I knew the rule specifically," Beem said later.</TE>
<TE>   Golf rules state a player cannot use anything other than his hand
to clear his line on the green.</TE>
<TE>   A member of the rules committee stopped Beem after he walked off
the green, but Beem was waiting.</TE>
<TE>   "I was off the green and I'm allowed to do that," Beem said he
told the official.</TE>
<TE>   The official checked the rule book just to be sure, and Beem was
correct.</TE>

<LD>While wondering how my beloved baseball could have fallen into such
disrepair, I turned the television to a national cable channel Friday
and was given a hint.</LD>
<LD>   There was a batter tauntingly waving his bat toward the outfield
fence.</LD>
<LD>   There was an infielder making a leaping catch, then sticking out
his tongue and posing.</LD>
<TE>   One baserunner cockily thumped his hands on his chest. Another
mockingly pointed at the losing opponents.</TE>
<TE>   You might think, so this is where baseball has landed, these
examples of the needless narcissism that has brought owners and
players to the verge of a strike.</TE>
<TE>   Except these were 11-and 12-year-old kids.</TE>
<TE>   Acting for a national television audience.</TE>
<TE>   Their children's game being broadcast as if they were adults.</TE>
<TE>   The unsettling images of the Little League World Series flashing
on ESPN and ABC, this is not where baseball has landed.</TE>
<TE>   This is where that fall begins.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Later this week, ABC will proudly announce that it is broadcasting
the Little League World Championship game for the 40th consecutive
year.</TE>
<TE>   It was wrong then, and it's wrong now.</TE>
<TE>   The sports giant ESPN proudly advertises that it is broadcasting
26 regional and World Series games leading up to the championship,
and this year even added three Little League girls' softball games.</TE>
<TE>   What's next, a televised draft to choose which moms bring the
snacks?</TE>
<TE>   Putting children's team sports on display, the cameras urging them
to act like adults while exploiting their childhood emotions, is
generally considered a lousy idea.</TE>
<TE>   When that sport is baseball, where every success and failure is
magnified by its individual nature--where else do little kids risk
such an utterly public failure as the strikeout?--the notion becomes
pure nonsense.</TE>
<TE>   Yet baseball is the only sport to do it.</TE>
<TE>   There are no live broadcasts of National Pop Warner football
championships, or National Junior Basketball title games, or AYSO
soccer super bowls.</TE>
<TE>   "The televising of these games gives Little League a powerful
vehicle for communicating its philosophy and purpose to more people
every year," Stephen D. Keener, Little League president, said in a
statement.</TE>
<TE>   In front of the camera, though, that philosophy changes.</TE>
<TE>   Part of the Little League pledge is, "I will play fair."</TE>
<TE>   Yet the lure of television has led to several major cheating
incidents, with last year's overage Bronx team the latest example.</TE>
<TE>   The air of distrust is so thick that when an equally diverse team
from Harlem qualified for the World Series this year, it was
immediately charged with the same sort of cheating, before being
cleared.</TE>
<TE>   Another part of the pledge is, "But win or lose, I will always do
my best."</TE>
<TE>   Sorry, now that much of the tournament is on television, losing is
no longer an option.</TE>
<TE>   Lose, and the cameras will be acutely focused on the coach's anger
and the children's pain.</TE>
<TE>   Lose, as a team from Massachusetts lost to a team from Hawaii in
the Series opener Friday, and the camera will linger on the face of
the pitcher who gives up the game-winning homer.</TE>
<TE>   It was awful to watch young Frank Flynn squirm on the mound after
throwing his fateful fastball in the bottom of the final inning. Only
after watching his discomfort for several long seconds were we
treated to the celebration of Hawaii hitter Travis Jones.</TE>
<TE>   There is a tendency to criticize the networks for showing the
games, but, hey, they aren't forcing Little League to take their
money.</TE>
<TE>   "For adults, it's a chance to bring back memories," ESPN spokesman
Mike Humes said. "For kids, it's an opportunity to document one of
the greatest moments of their lives."</TE>
<TE>   And people watch, as many as 2.3 million folks for one game last
year, equaling the average number of viewers for Major League
Baseball.</TE>
<TE>   Here's hoping Little League is spending that money well, because
it certainly comes with a cost.</TE>
<TE>   Announcers talk about the kids as if they're professionals--"He
didn't want to throw that pitch, he's really feeling the pressure."</TE>
<TE>   Some kids scowl and stalk and preen as if they're professionals.</TE>
<TE>   The individualism that has overtaken the professional game
infiltrates Williamsport, Pa., like late-summer humidity.</TE>
<TE>   Back home, playing in front of Mom and Dad and a bunch of kids on
bikes, it's about the team. But once in Williamsport, even an
11-year-old can figure out that the good kids get the air time, the
outlandish kids get even more air time, and the weaker kids get
embarrassed.</TE>
<TE>   "For many kids, playing on national television is the chance of a
lifetime," said Dr. Todd Boyd, a USC professor who writes about
sports and culture. "But this isn't like playing for Mom and Dad and
the neighbors. Once the camera comes on, it becomes a performance. It
can make a spectacle for people who are too young to understand its
ramifications."</TE>
<TE>   Five years ago, I was there, writing a column about South Mission
Viejo's apparent world championship.</TE>
<TE>   Until Mexico scored twice in the bottom of the final inning for a
stunning victory.</TE>
<TE>   As the cameras focused on our local kids' tears, and their coach's
frustration, I realized I shouldn't be there either.</TE>
<TE>   Given the state of Major League Baseball, the worst thing we can
do is treat our children like major leaguers.</TE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The national cry of anguish went up Friday from baseball fans
outraged that players dared to set an Aug. 30 strike date. Fans are
disillusioned by the possibility of the second strike in eight years
and enraged that neither owners nor players appear to place a higher
priority on playing games than fighting over money. From peanut
vendors to President Bush, fans told both sides to shut up and settle
their dispute now, to act in the best interests of the sport. Those
sentiments evoke a chuckle from Barry Axelrod, a longtime player
agent from Encinitas. He can sympathize, to be sure. But he looks at
baseball's perfect record--in the last 30 years, no labor agreement
has been reached without a players' strike or owners' lockout--and
suggests fans might be wasting their breath. "I have never seen
either of these sides care one iota about the court of public
opinion," he said. "That's indicated by what we've done the past 30
years." For fans numb to the sights or sounds of Commissioner Bud
Selig and union leader Donald Fehr, and for fans lost in a sea of tax
thresholds, local revenues and split-pool vs. straight-pool revenue
sharing, The Times spoke with two Southern California baseball
figures not involved in the current negotiations and asked them to
discuss the issue fundamental to each side.</LD>
<LD>   *</LD>
<TE>   Barry Axelrod represents such stars as Jeff Bagwell and Craig
Biggio of the Houston Astros, Rich Aurilia of the San Francisco
Giants and Mark Grace of the Arizona Diamondbacks. Axelrod, an agent
for more than two decades, represented Darryl Kile, the St. Louis
Cardinal pitcher who died in June.</TE>
<TE>   From a union point of view, Axelrod said, the issue is simple.</TE>
<TE>   "They're not asking for anything new," he said. "All they want is
the status quo."</TE>
<TE>   That's perfectly understandable, in a year in which the average
salary is $2.4 million.</TE>
<TE>   But, with United Airlines on the verge of filing for bankruptcy,
unions representing its machinists understand they might be required
to make wage concessions for the business to remain viable. Major
league owners would like to see players exhibit a similar sense of
responsibility to an industry that no one disputes will pay healthy
salaries under any labor agreement.</TE>
<TE>   In a May interview with The Times, Commissioner Bud Selig said six
to eight teams could go out of business within 18 months, in the
absence of economic reform. He declined to name the teams. He also
said owners were a collective $4 billion in debt.</TE>
<TE>   In July, one day after Selig said an unnamed team might not meet
its payroll the following week, president and chief operating officer
Bob DuPuy said every payroll would be met that week.</TE>
<TE>   Three months after Selig testified before Congress that nine of
the 30 teams turned an operating profit last season, Forbes magazine
reported its figures showed 20 teams did.</TE>
<TE>   "We have a commissioner who has not one ounce of credibility,"
Axelrod said. "If there were really those dire circumstances, of
course players should say, 'What can we do to help save this?'</TE>
<TE>   "Show us your books--especially in this era of Enrons and
WorldComs. If you prove it, of course we won't let this industry fold
up."</TE>
<TE>   The union skepticism only mounted after two lawsuits that could
have forced Selig's office to reveal confidential financial data were
settled out of court. In one suit, a co-owner of the New York Mets
had accused Selig's office of conspiring with the other co-owner and
an appraiser to "manufacture phantom operating losses" that would
lower the value of the team.</TE>
<TE>   The union also believes that the constant drumbeat of an economic
doomsday has discouraged some fans and sponsors from investing in an
industry with $3.5 billion in annual revenues.</TE>
<TE>   "All we ever see and hear about are the horribly negative things
that come out of baseball. No one ever promotes the good part,"
Axelrod said.</TE>
<TE>   "The greatest example of that is our commissioner starting to talk
about contraction two days after the greatest World Series some of us
have ever seen."</TE>
<TE>   Four decades ago, then-NFL Commissioner Pete Rozelle convinced
owners in his league to share virtually all revenue. Major league
owners never contemplated--let alone agreed to--such a concept. Over
the past decades, skyrocketing revenues have led to skyrocketing
franchise values as well as skyrocketing salaries.</TE>
<TE>   If Fox pays top dollar to buy the Dodgers and makes enough money
to buy pitcher Kevin Brown for $105 million, how can the guy who
bought the Kansas City Royals for less than one-third of what Fox
paid for the Dodgers complain when the Royals can't afford Brown? The
answer, owners suggest, is that fans of small-market teams lose hope
and interest if their team has no chance to win.</TE>
<TE>   Because revenue sharing and a luxury tax affect wages, the players
must approve those measures as part of a new collective bargaining
agreement.</TE>
<TE>   "The underlying, most divisive issues are small-market,
small-revenue owners vs. large-market, large-revenue owners," Axelrod
said. "One side or the other has to get the players' approval. The
players are naturally going to come down on the side of the
large-market owners. They're the guys that pay the big salaries."</TE>
<TE>   Had the owners' proposed economic structure been in effect when
the Dodgers signed Brown, the team could have been liable for
millions in a luxury tax and millions more in revenue sharing.</TE>
<TE>   "That's a full frontal attack on large-market ownership," Axelrod
said. "It's the small-market guys going after the large-market guys,
and they're trying to get the players to agree."</TE>

<HD>Rodriguez Gets His Hat Trick in Texas</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>ARLINGTON, Texas</DL>
<LD>Alex Rodriguez wasn't thinking about being in last place or the
possibility of another strike. He just kept hitting the ball hard.</LD>
<LD>   Rodriguez hit three home runs, becoming the sixth player with five
consecutive 40-homer seasons, as the Texas Rangers defeated the
Toronto Blue Jays, 9-5, on Saturday night.</LD>
<LD>   "When you have nights like tonight, you don't really think much
about the past or the future," Rodriguez said.</LD>
<TE>   "I was pretty much possessed by the moment and it was a great
feeling. Hopefully, I can prolong it as much as I can."</TE>
<TE>   Rodriguez hit a two-run homer in the first inning, his 40th of the
season. He added Nos. 41 and 42 with solo shots leading off the third
and seventh innings.</TE>
<TE>   Before striking out to lead off the fifth, Rodriguez had reached
base in eight consecutive plate appearances--including three homers
in a row.</TE>
<TE>   His solo homer in the ninth inning Friday night gave the Rangers a
6-5 victory and ended a four-for-four night in which he also had a
walk.</TE>
<TE>   He singled in his final at-bat Wednesday in an 11-6 victory
against the Chicago White Sox.</TE>
<TE>   "When I feel the way I do, I don't do a lot of preparing,"
Rodriguez said. "I just go up, see the ball and hit the ball."</TE>
<TE>   Rodriguez never had a chance for his fourth homer, getting left on
deck when Mike Lamb struck out to end the eighth. He insisted that a
four-homer game never crossed his mind.</TE>
<TE>   Rafael Palmeiro and Herbert Perry also homered for the Rangers,
last in the AL West at 53-68.</TE>
<TE>   Rodriguez leads the majors with 107 runs batted in and is second
in homers to Sammy Sosa, who hit his 43rd for the Chicago Cubs on
Saturday. This is also Sosa's fifth consecutive 40-homer season.</TE>
<TE>   "There are a few guys in the majors at a different level, and Alex
is definitely right there at the top of that list," Ranger Manager
Jerry Narron said.</TE>
<TE>   "Not to take anything away from anybody else, but he is the best
of all. And his career will prove that out."</TE>
<TE>   Babe Ruth holds the major league record with seven consecutive
40-homer seasons from 1926-32. Ralph Kiner, Duke Snider and Ken
Griffey Jr. have all had five in a row.</TE>
<TE>   Rodriguez's first two homers Saturday, a 404-foot shot to left and
a 416-foot blast to right-center, came off Steve Parris (5-4). He hit
a 366-foot homer down the right-field line off Corey Thurman in the
seventh.</TE>
<TE>   It was the second three-homer game of Rodriguez's career, the
other also coming against the Blue Jays while he was with Seattle on
April 16, 2000.</TE>
<TE>   He has seven multihomer games this season and 27 in his career.</TE>

<KH>SOCCER GRAHAME L. JONES</KH>
<HD>With Cup in Past, Teams Look Ahead</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GRAHAME L. JONES</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>By now, the World Cup is a distant memory, a well-thumbed volume best
confined to the history shelves. It's time to look ahead, and this
week provides the first opportunity to do so.</LD>
<LD>   On Wednesday, no fewer than 50 countries will be playing, among
them five teams ranked in the top 10 in the world and 13 ranked in
the top 20.</LD>
<LD>   The slate of 25 friendly matches will see Luiz Felipe Scolari bow
out as Brazil's coach, his mission accomplished, while Jacques
Santini and Inaki Saez will make their debuts as the coaches of
France and Spain, respectively.</LD>
<TE>   On the horizon is the European Championship in Portugal in 2004,
and Wednesday games offer coaches the opportunity to look at new
players in a competitive situation before qualifying begins next
month.</TE>
<TE>   Spain will be one of the favorites in Euro 2004, and Saez has set
about rebuilding the team from the back, something that was forced on
him by the retirement of defender Fernando Hierro and midfielder Luis
Enrique.</TE>
<TE>   He has called in five uncapped players for the game against
Hungary in Budapest, including four defenders. Carlos Marchena of
Valencia is Hierro's heir apparent, while Jose Antonio Garcia Calvo
(Atletico Madrid), Juanito (Real Betis) and Raul Bravo (Real Madrid)
are also new to the back line. Midfielder Pablo Orbaiz (Athletic
Bilbao) is the other newcomer.</TE>
<TE>   Germany, too, will be favored to reach and possibly win Euro 2004,
and Coach Rudi Voeller has made it abundantly clear that he expects
no less from the team that finished second to Brazil in the World
Cup.</TE>
<TE>   "We're starting all over again," he said. "What happened at the
World Cup does not count anymore, and young players will be getting
chances to prove their worth."</TE>
<TE>   That said, Voeller included only one new face on the team that
will play Bulgaria in Sofia: defender Arne Friedrich, 23, of Hertha
Berlin.</TE>
<TE>   But Voeller told Kicker magazine that the veterans should not
presume their places on the team are secure, or that reaching
Portugal will be easy.</TE>
<TE>   "Anyone who thinks that coming second at the World Cup means
qualification for Euro 2004 is a formality will hear from me," he
said. "I will ruthlessly clamp down on any complacency.</TE>
<TE>   "To succeed, you need to have consistency at the highest level,
and we must do everything we can to maintain that standard."</TE>
<TE>   Santini's job is somewhat different.</TE>
<TE>   The last thing he wants to see is France play to its World Cup
standard, when it went home in disgrace, without a victory or even a
goal.</TE>
<TE>   "I was named [coach] to help France qualify for the European
Championship, and I intend to do so," he said.</TE>
<TE>   To that end, Santini has included seven players who were not on
the World Cup roster on the team that will play Tunisia in Tunis,
including four who have never played for the national team. They are
defenders Philippe Mexes (Auxerre) and Anthony Reveillere (Stade
Rennes), midfielder Bruno Cheyrou (Liverpool) and forward Sidney
Govou (Lyon).</TE>
<TE>   "My idea was to rely on a nucleus of experienced players like
Zinedine Zidane or Emmanuel Petit, who were in South Korea," Santini
said. "But some young blood has to be put in. The team needs new
energy and fresh enthusiasm."</TE>
<TE>   France is the reigning European champion, and Santini knows very
well that failing to qualify for Portugal will cost him his new job.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm here to make sure that we will have the opportunity to defend
our crown," he said. "So I will review the situation in November
2003, and if things don't go well, I'll face the consequences."</TE>
<TE>   One coach who is untroubled by any consequences is Scolari, who
has called his entire World Cup-winning team together for one last
celebration, against Paraguay in Fortaleza, Brazil.</TE>
<TE>   It's a farewell party of sorts, now that Scolari has announced his
retirement as Brazil's coach, and Paraguay has made sure not to spoil
it because it has left its most controversial player and its best
player off the team.</TE>
<TE>   Anibal Ruiz, the Uruguayan coach who has temporary charge of the
team while Paraguay searches for a replacement for Cesare Maldini,
will be without goalkeeper Jose Luis Chilavert and defender Carlos
Gamarra.</TE>
<TE>   The troublesome Chilavert was not selected by Ruiz, and Gamarra
asked to be excluded while he fights for a place in the Inter Milan
starting lineup.</TE>
<TE>   Brazil's team, meanwhile, includes a player who is fighting to get
out of the Inter Milan lineup; in fact, out of Milan altogether.</TE>
<TE>   Ronaldo left Italy and returned to Brazil four days earlier than
he needed simply to escape the pressure of fans and the media over
his on-again, off-again transfer to Real Madrid.</TE>
<TE>   The World Cup's top goal scorer is under contract to the Serie A
team until 2006 and Inter Milan has put a $100-million price tag on
him, but neither factor is necessarily an obstacle.</TE>
<TE>   Marca, the Spanish sports daily, reported Thursday that Florentino
Perez, the president of European champion Real Madrid, and Massimo
Moratti, Inter Milan's president, would meet this weekend on the
Balearic Islands and hash out a trade that would satisfy both teams.</TE>
<TE>   Real Madrid is said to have offered $48 million for Ronaldo, plus
one or two other unidentified players.</TE>
<TE>   Slovenia and Ireland have taken different approaches to their own
temperamental stars: Zlatko Zahovic and Roy Keane, both of whom were
sent home in disgrace from the World Cup.</TE>
<TE>   Slovenia's new coach, Bojan Prasnikar, has invited Zahovic back
into the national team for the game against Italy in Trieste, but
Ireland Coach Mick McCarthy has purposely left Keane out of the Irish
team that will play Finland in Helsinki.</TE>
<TE>   Bygones, it seems, are not always bygones.</TE>

<HD>Sparks Find Rest of Story</HD>
<DH>WNBA: L.A. completes sweep of Seattle and earns two extra
days off before next series.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE TERRY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Round One is done.</LD>
<LD>   And the Sparks are both happy and relieved.</LD>
<LD>   In dispatching the Seattle Storm, 69-59, before 8,187 at Staples
Center on Saturday, Los Angeles wrapped up its WNBA Western
Conference first-round series, two games to none.</LD>
<TE>   That will get the Sparks a couple extra days of rest as they await
the winner of the Houston-Utah series that resumes today in Houston.
The Starzz lead the series, 1-0.</TE>
<TE>   Mwadi Mabika, for one, could use a break after spraining her left
ankle, which caused her to leave the game briefly in the second half.</TE>
<TE>   Seattle made the Sparks earn the victory, coming back from a
15-point second-half deficit to close within two in the final two
minutes. But the Sparks, who got 23 points from Lisa Leslie and 15
from Tamecka Dixon, held off the Storm to win their eighth
consecutive first-round playoff game.</TE>
<TE>   "This was a very good game for us," Spark Coach Michael Cooper
said. "You have to give Seattle a lot of credit for not quitting. But
you still must respect the world champions.</TE>
<TE>   "For teams to disrespect us, I say shame on you."</TE>
<TE>   Seattle, which reached the playoffs for the first time in the
franchise's three years, got 17 points each from Sue Bird and Kamila
Vodichkova. But its leading scorer, Lauren Jackson, was held to four
points in 34 minutes, and the problems that plagued the Storm in
Thursday's loss were present again--too many missed shots (20 of 58,
34.5%), too many turnovers (17) and too much talent on the Spark
roster.</TE>
<TE>   "There is no doubt that this is the best team in the world,"
Seattle Coach Lin Dunn said of the Sparks. "They have so many
weapons. They are big, strong and experienced. I just don't see any
team beating them.</TE>
<TE>   "I hope our team has earned a lot of respect from the Sparks. We
played them tough. They are our role models. They are the big sister
and we are the little sister. We want to be just like them."</TE>
<TE>   Now the Sparks hope that, after an erratic regular season in which
they still managed to compile the league's best record, they are
peaking at the right time. Saturday's was their fifth consecutive
victory. During the regular season, they ran off nine in a row in
June.</TE>
<TE>   "What we can take from this series is we're a good team," said
DeLisha Milton, who had a game-high 10 rebounds. "And when we execute
our game plan, offensively and defensively, we're a better team. This
was a confidence boost for us that I think we needed, knowing the
struggles we had during the regular season."</TE>
<TE>   "We're clicking real well," added Latasha Byears. "We know what's
at stake, and right now we can't afford to slip up."</TE>
<TE>   The Storm appeared determined to force a third game on Monday,
gaining an early 12-6 lead as the Sparks made only one of their first
nine shots. But Los Angeles, which shot 41.7%, (25 for 60), found a
rhythm, and by halftime had pulled ahead, 33-25.</TE>
<TE>   When the Sparks went on a 13-2 run early in the second half to go
ahead, 46-31, with 12:43 to play, it seemed all they had to do was
control the clock. Seattle had one last charge, however, outscoring
the Sparks, 25-12, to narrow the deficit to 58-56 with 2:32 to play.</TE>
<TE>   A driving, twisting layup by Dixon ended the Storm rally. Fouled
on the play, she made the free throw to push the lead to 61-56, and
Seattle got no closer.</TE>
<TE>   The next series begins Thursday, and Dixon said it doesn't matter
who the opponent is, Utah or Houston.</TE>
<TE>   "Both are very talented teams," Dixon said. "We'll be watching
[today's] game with great interest. It's going to be a great series
to the end. And no matter who wins, we have to maintain our focus."</TE>
<TE>   Storm players said the series was a learning experience and a
reason to celebrate.</TE>
<TE>   "Going into next year, we can feel good we made a run at it and we
can now be considered a playoff team," Seattle guard Michelle
Marciniak said. "A chapter with L.A. has been closed for this year,
but we appreciated playing them because they are the best team. And
we gave them a run for their money, whether they liked it or not."</TE>
<TE>   Said Bird: "If we get to the playoffs next year, we'll have a
little more experience."</TE>

<KH>UCLA REPORT</KH>
<HD>Safety First for Freshman Page</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE HENSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Call it a taste of his just desserts. Freshman Jarrod Page chose UCLA
over a $700,000 offer from the Milwaukee Brewers, and during his
first practice with veterans Saturday he lined up at strong safety
with the first-team defense.</LD>
<LD>   That's not to say he will be the starter. In fact, that's
unlikely.</LD>
<LD>   But he can change his mind and sign with the Brewers any time
before the first day of fall classes Sept. 23, so perhaps Bruin
coaches are sending a message that he is in their immediate plans.</LD>
<TE>   Defensive coordinator Phil Snow said Page and several other
safeties will share time with the first unit during camp.</TE>
<TE>   "We have eight days of two-a-days to find out who can play," Snow
said. "I want to put a young kid alongside a veteran. We had Jarrod
on the field with [free safety] Matt Ware so Matt could get him lined
up properly and the kid could run around."</TE>
<TE>   Ben Emmanuel, a sophomore who had two interceptions as a reserve
last season, is expected to start at strong safety. But in camp he is
also spending time at free safety to provide insurance for Ware.
Other candidates at strong safety are sophomore Jabril Raymo, junior
Kevin Brant and freshman Eric McNeal.</TE>
<TE>   "Matt is the free safety and there is a lot of competition for the
other spot," Snow said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Rodney Leisle interprets it as a sign of respect. The junior
defensive tackle, regarded as the Bruins' top lineman, was held out
of both practices because he is recovering from a slight left knee
sprain he suffered during the summer.</TE>
<TE>   "If it was up to me I'd be out there," he said. "But they don't
want me to get hurt. The coaches said I have nothing to prove and
they want to take a look at some of the younger players."</TE>
<TE>   Leisle probably won't practice extensively until the middle of
next week. He spent part of practice running sprints on the track
surrounding the field.</TE>
<TE>   The only other player who did not practice was center Mike
McCloskey, suffering from flu.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Kevin Jordan is UCLA's career reception leader, but these days he
gives more than he receives.</TE>
<TE>   Jordan, 29, is employed by Athletes in Action and spends time
providing players with spiritual guidance. He was at practice
Saturday morning, chatting with Bruin players while holding his
10-month-old daughter.</TE>
<TE>   "This is rewarding work," he said. "We have bible study groups and
a lot of times we talk about things besides religion, anything that
helps out."</TE>
<TE>   Jordan, who had 179 receptions from 1992-95, will conduct the
Bruins' bible study session today.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Any qualms the Bruins might have had about spending a week in
Thousand Oaks were quashed soon after arriving Friday night at Cal
Lutheran.</TE>
<TE>   "The food was fantastic and the dorms are sweet," kicker Chris
Griffith said. "It's really comfortable and all the people who work
here are nice."</TE>
<TE>   Only two players stay in each two-bedroom suite, giving each
player his own room.</TE>
<TE>   After workouts, the players watched a highlight video of the New
England Patriots' unlikely run to the Super Bowl championship last
season.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Crowds of about 200 watched each practice, about double the number
that have shown up in the past in Westwood. Some fans parked on a
slope adjacent to the field and tailgated.</TE>
<TE>   Today's practices--at 10 a.m. and 4 p.m.--are open to the public.</TE>

<LD>Tailback Justin Fargas pulled a hamstring before the first snap.</LD>
<LD>   Reserve quarterback Matt Cassel injured his right knee on the
eighth play.</LD>
<LD>   So it was considered a victory of sorts when the Trojans completed
their first scrimmage Saturday without other injury-related setbacks.</LD>
<TE>   "We wanted to make sure we went and played real physical," USC
Coach Pete Carroll said. "We saw some playmakers today."</TE>
<TE>   Quarterbacks Carson Palmer and Matt Leinart, wide receiver Keary
Colbert and kicker David Davis provided some of the highlights during
the 63-play scrimmage.</TE>
<TE>   Fargas, a transfer from Michigan who was listed No. 1 on the depth
chart at the start of training camp, did not make it out of warmups
as a crowd that included about 120 former USC players looked on. The
senior injured his right hamstring performing a drill and spent the
rest of the morning on the trainers' table.</TE>
<TE>   "My leg has been a little sore the last couple days," Fargas said.
"When it tightened up on me, I just knew I couldn't push anything."</TE>
<TE>   Cassel, a sophomore who was battling Leinart to become Palmer's
back-up, was knocked to the ground on the last play of the second
series while throwing an incomplete pass. Cassel was taken to the
hospital afterward for an MRI exam.</TE>
<TE>   "They don't think it's any major ligament so that's a good sign,"
Cassel said.</TE>
<TE>   Palmer completed five of nine passes for 88 yards, including a
35-yard touchdown pass to Colbert, who had three receptions for 73
yards. Palmer had one pass intercepted.</TE>
<TE>   Leinart, a freshman, completed five of nine passes for 97 yards
and three touchdowns and also rushed for a touchdown.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Fargas' injury, coupled with senior Sultan McCullough's inactivity
because of hamstring soreness, presented more rushing opportunities
for senior Malaefou MacKenzie, sophomore Darryl Poston and freshman
Hershel Dennis.</TE>
<TE>   Poston gained 18 yards in seven carries and scored on a three-yard
run. MacKenzie rushed for 10 yards in six carries and Dennis gained
nine yards in six carries.</TE>
<TE>   Freshman fullback Brandon Hancock gained 19 yards in three
carries. The Trojans rushed for 62 yards in 30 carries.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Davis kicked field goals of 44, 41 and 30 yards before missing a
45-yard attempt.</TE>
<TE>   "The snaps and the holds were great and the front line is doing
awesome," Davis said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Sophomore Jason Leach, starting in place of injured All-American
safety Troy Palomalu, intercepted a pass thrown by Palmer when
cornerback Darrell Rideaux deflected a ball intended for receiver
Kareem Kelly.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Palomalu said he would not practice today as he continues to
recover from a mild concussion. He could also sit out Monday's
scrimmage at the Coliseum.... Junior cornerback Marcell Allmond
remained hospitalized for an infection in his right knee.... Former
All-Americans Pat Howell, Anthony Davis and Sam Cunningham were among
former players who attended Saturday's scrimmage and luncheon.</TE>
