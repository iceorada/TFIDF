<HD>In Their Own Words: The Day That Belief Was Tested</HD>
<DH>Television* A PBS documentary listens as Americans talk
about how 9/11 affected their faith.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PATRICIA BRENNAN</AU>
<BD>WASHINGTON POST</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Ordinarily, two hours of people talking might not be particularly
interesting television. But in the case of "Faith and Doubt at Ground
Zero," what they say is often touching and in some cases profound.</LD>
<LD>   Watching people try to make sense of what happened last Sept. 11
becomes a look into the human condition.</LD>
<LD>   The program, which aired on PBS' "Frontline" Tuesday and will
repeat Wednesday, was made by Helen Whitney, who has made films on
life in a Massachusetts monastery and presidential contenders, and an
award-winning portrait of Pope John Paul II. For this one, she
interviewed 850 people to find those who would make a compelling
program.</LD>
<TE>   "I feel that the human face and the human voice and what it is
that people say when they're really being thoughtful and poetic and
precise in their language is riveting," Whitney said. "A thought that
is pursued naturally in all of its windings and developments can be
dramatic and powerful."</TE>
<TE>   She brackets her subjects' words with poignant footage and music,
including Barber's always-moving "Adagio for Strings" and a blend of
patriotic and religious songs and prayers and chants.</TE>
<TE>   In "Faith and Doubt," people face their deepest beliefs, asking
whether evil and God exist. Some are atheists, some are agnostics,
others are Christians, Jews, Muslims and Buddhists. For some, their
beliefs were badly shaken. For others, religious faith was a comfort.
Some became cynical. Some cry as they recall the day.</TE>
<TE>   A retired policewoman who lost her 23-year-old daughter, and now
raises her young grandson, talks with tears running down her cheeks
but seems comforted by her beliefs. Soprano Renee Fleming, who sang
"Amazing Grace" at the memorial at ground zero, begins to cry when
she explains that she had to look above the crowd so she wouldn't
break down during her performance.</TE>
<TE>   One man says he went to Rockaway Beach--where another plane
crashed only days later--and cursed God for the cruel loss of life,
including more than 30 of his friends. "It was too barbaric the way
the lives were taken," he says. "So I look at him now as a
barbarian.... I think I am a good Christian, but I have a different
view and image of him now, and I can't replace it with the old
image."</TE>
<TE>   There also is a close look at organized religion: A Catholic
priest says he recognizes a dark side underlying the
attack--religious fanaticism. A rabbi says all people who claim to be
religious must acknowledge "a serious shadow side to this thing." A
Lutheran minister who prayed at the Yankee Stadium memorial service
with leaders of other religions is battling to stay in the Missouri
Synod as others accuse him of heresy. He was suspended pending
appeals.</TE>
<TE>   And there is an attempt to face the concept of evil. A retired
firefighter whose son was lost says: God "had nothing to do with
this. He was fighting evil that day like he does every day."</TE>
<TE>   It was the six months that Whitney spent with monks at St.
Joseph's Abbey in Massachusetts that set her on an exploration of
faith. She was a new mother when she made "Monastery" in 1980, a film
she calls "one of those great experiences in my life, in which a film
just seems to happen like wind in my sails. It's my favorite film. It
was largely such a happy experience."</TE>
<TE>   After that, she said, "I studied at a Bible study group for Jews
and Christians and agnostics and atheists. We read for eight years
together. I continued on in a spiritual reading group for many
years."</TE>
<TE>   Then she made "Frontline's" 1996 election-year special, "The
Choice," comparing the characters of Bill Clinton and Bob Dole.
"There was religion in that, among the powerful forces shaping those
two men," she said.</TE>
<TE>   In 1997, she and co-writer Jane Barnes received a Writers Guild
Award nomination for "John Paul II: The Millennial Pope." "There was
nothing easy about that film," Whitney said. "The challenge in that
film was to avoid the simplicities and the hagiography of the right.
He is a tower of contradictions, and I had to honor them."</TE>
<TE>   After the attacks of Sept. 11, recalled Whitney, she immediately
wanted to do a film.</TE>
<TE>   Whitney had already been in contact with "Frontline" executives
about "The Future of Faith," a six-hour series on faith. They advised
her to come up with a plan for a 9/11 special.</TE>
<TE>   "I spent a few weeks thinking about it very seriously, bringing a
group of friends into my apartment, all of them smart, and we all
stayed up talking about whether there was a film there," she said. "I
was surprised by the unanimity of the language of history and
sociology and politics, but there also was a metaphysical language. I
was so startled to hear that. I began to think about it
metaphysically."</TE>
<TE>   In looking for people to interview, she said, "I cast my net very
widely. I talked not only to people who had lost people and people
who were in the towers, but firemen's widows, opera singers, CEOs,
security guards. We pre-interviewed 850 people."</TE>
<TE>   Whitney began to see themes for her program: The first would be to
let survivors and relatives of World Trade Center victims recount the
shock of the day. The second was concern about God's role. "Their
belief and unbelief was challenged, whether it was altered or
enlarged or shattered, or people's conception of no God was
shattered," she said, "and how [what happened] challenged what we
mean by evil.</TE>
<TE>   "The last act was very clear, was what people really wanted to
talk about: the potential for violence, this paradox of [religion as]
beauty and grace and a window to the sublime, and all that darkness
of destruction."</TE>
<TE>   In the film, Msgr. Lorenzo Albacete says, "I recognized an old
companion: I recognized religion." Rabbi Brad Hirschfield agrees:
"Religion drove those planes into those buildings. It's amazing how
good religion is at mobilizing people to do awful, murderous things.
There is a dark side to it."</TE>
<TE>   Whitney said: "Before Sept. 11, I would not have found the rabbis
and priests that were willing to be deep and searching and look
within their own traditions. I wanted people to talk only about what
they knew and no finger-pointing.</TE>
<TE>   "I also came to know believers whose faith was profoundly
challenged: Who is this God and where was he and how can there be
such pain and such evil in the universe? I was taken back by the
fierceness of the questioning and the width of it and the breadth of
it."</TE>
<TE>   In addition, she said, "it had a very strong effect on me. It was
hard to be in the midst of so much sorrow and grieving and become
close to people. I don't even know what kind of sea change there has
been inside of me. In terms of my faith, it's too soon to tell."</TE>
<TE>   "Faith and Doubt at Ground Zero" airs again Wednesday at 8 p.m. on
KCET and KVCR.</TE>

<HD>Canada's Satiric Public TV Marks 50</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>TORONTO</DL>
<LD>One of Canada's best known and most widely trusted public servants,
CBC Television, turns 50 today and will mark its birthday with a
celebration of its satirical past, even though much of its history
has been a serious struggle for survival.</LD>
<LD>   When the CBC went to air for the first time in Toronto and
Montreal in 1952, the comedy was unintended, with its logo hitting
the screens upside down.</LD>
<LD>   But since then, the public broadcaster has helped nurture a
dynasty of satirical comedy troupes that have kept the country
chuckling at itself in a self-deprecating way that has been taken as
a national characteristic.</LD>
<TE>   The first anniversary show, "The Joke's on Us: 50 Years of CBC
Satire," will be broadcast tonight, launching a week of documentaries
and specials reflecting on the network's five decades of existence.</TE>
<TE>   "Kids in the Hall," "SCTV" and the "Red Green Show" are among the
satirical programs nurtured by the CBC that went on to acclaim
outside the country. "SCTV" alone produced such entertainers as
Martin Short, John Candy, Catherine O'Hara, Eugene Levy, Joe Flaherty
and Dave Thomas.</TE>
<TE>   Dave Foley of "Newsradio," Lorne Michaels, creator of "Saturday
Night Live," and comic actors Michael J. Fox, David Steinberg and
Mike Myers were all on CBC shows in their youth.</TE>
<TE>   Canadians take their comedy, and the CBC, seriously. In a recent
poll of 1,100 Canadians, 81% deemed the network an important element
in maintaining and building national identity.</TE>
<TE>   "The CBC is like the canary that miners take down the mine shaft
to warn them of the presence of poisonous gas," said Evan Solomon,
host of CBC Newsworld's "HotType" books show.</TE>
<TE>   "When the CBC is ailing, it is a warning sign that there are
poisons in the air for the whole country. It is a warning that we are
losing our ability to generate ingenuity.... If the CBC disappears in
the next 50 years, we are no longer the country we wanted to be when
we were founded," Solomon added.</TE>
<TE>   Throughout its life, the CBC has continually battled commercial
networks and cutbacks.</TE>

<HD>A One-Year Slice of Americana</HD>
<DH>NPR's 'Present at the Creation' series examines the
nation's cultural icons, from OK to hamburgers.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE CARNEY</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>They're the pillars, large and small, that serve as the foundation of
American culture: OK, overalls, the hamburger, Scrabble,
Crackerjacks, the electric guitar, the recliner, Gumby and "The
Grapes of Wrath." And they're all so familiar, it seems as if they've
always been here.</LD>
<LD>   But "Present at the Creation," a yearlong series from National
Public Radio, travels to the time before each of these existed and
examines how they came to be.</LD>
<LD>   The series airs every Monday, during the half-hour of "Morning
Edition" that begins at 3:30, 5:30 and 7:30 a.m. on KCRW-FM (89.9)
and KPCC-FM (89.3).</LD>
<TE>   "All these things we take for granted, but where did they come
from? You never get to go back and talk about the beginnings of
something," said NPR reporter Renee Montagne, whose segment about
Jack Kerouac's "On the Road" airs Monday.</TE>
<TE>   Kerouac's frenetic travelogue of cross-country meanderings that
included Los Angeles, San Francisco, Sacramento and the migrant
fields of the San Joaquin Valley, which served as the book of genesis
for American counterculture and youth rebellion, is one of several
topics with California connections. Others, upcoming or already
covered, include "California Dreamin'," the surfboard, "The Grapes of
Wrath" and, close to Election Day to coincide with the L.A. secession
issue, a piece on the Hollywood sign.</TE>
<TE>   "Of course the Hollywood sign began the way L.A. began, as a
housing development, and it was put up there for that reason,"
Montagne said, laughing.</TE>
<TE>   "Present at the Creation" grew out of the success of the NPR 100,
a series the network ran in 2000 chronicling the most important
American musical works of the 20th century.</TE>
<TE>   This time NPR polled a panel of cultural critics--George Holt of
the North Carolina Museum of Art; playwright Naomi Iizuka; Spin
magazine senior editor Will Hermes; Lolis Elie, a columnist for the
New Orleans Times-Picayune; and L.A.-based fashion designer Trina
Turk--and asked them to winnow a list of American cultural icons
worth dissecting.</TE>
<TE>   The choices had to be significant and immediately recognizable.
And the results were "the designs, sounds, images and writings that
helped shape American culture," according to an NPR release, spanning
culture both high and low, from Henry David Thoreau's "Walden" to
"Animal House."</TE>
<TE>   "If there wasn't more to it than 'This is just a cool painting' or
'This is a cool saying,' we would have dropped it," said Ellen
McDonnell, "Morning Edition" executive producer.</TE>
<TE>   Elizabeth Blair, supervising producer of "Present at the
Creation," called the segments "love stories about the creative
process."</TE>
<TE>   "It's about the constellation of events that make something
happen. These stories are about looking at the thing's origins and
how and why it's embraced," she said.</TE>
<TE>   For example, the piece on surfboards is "not a story about the
plank. It's about how Hawaiians made it a spiritual experience."</TE>
<TE>   And "California Dreamin'," McDonnell said, "was not just about the
Mamas and the Papas. It was about the time, it was about the musical
landscape."</TE>
<TE>   The lyrics of wistful longing and the search for comfort resonated
with many when the song was released in 1965, said NPR special
correspondent Susan Stamberg, who reported the piece.</TE>
<TE>   " 'I'd be safe and warm,' " she said, quoting the song, "and it
was certainly a time people were looking for that."</TE>
<TE>   NPR reporters clamored for the chance to dive into these stories,
even though the work had to be squeezed into their regular duties.</TE>
<TE>   "When you looked at the list, there were all these interesting
things to do," said Montagne, who in addition to the reports on
Kerouac and the Hollywood sign did a story on the French Quarter.
"For a lot of people, it was like being a kid in a candy store. There
was a lot of, 'Wait a minute. That one's gone!' "</TE>
<TE>   "This is so much fun. You dig really deep into these stories,
because they're history," she said.</TE>
<TE>   The downside is that each piece is limited to 6 1/2 or 8 1/2
minutes.</TE>
<TE>   "You get this treasure trove, and you have to toss stuff out right
and left," Montagne said, noting that among the things she had to cut
out was audio of Kerouac and his traveling companion, Neal Casady.</TE>
<TE>   But for each of the stories, many of the leftovers are available
on NPR's Web site, www.npr.org, along with the segments themselves.
The series began in January and will run through December.</TE>
<TE>   "I think these pieces really do have a shelf life," Blair said.</TE>
<TE>   NPR spokeswoman Jenny Lawhorn said the "Present at the Creation"
stories, once they appear on the Web site, are among the most popular
items that listeners e-mail to others about.</TE>
<TE>   "If you listened to all of these," she said, "you'd be armed for
every cocktail party you ever went to in your life."</TE>

<HD>Arduous, Thrilling Godard</HD>
<DH>The acclaimed French filmmaker's 'In Praise of Love' is
characteristically difficult, but with a dose of welcome
exhilaration.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MANOHLA DARGIS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>After years spent trying to bury cinema--or at least its more obvious
pleasures--Jean-Luc Godard has made a new movie that exalts its
glory. A film about history, memory and the distance between the two,
"In Praise of Love" is an almost-love story about a French artist and
a Jewish woman that also takes measure of the distances between
identity and nationalism, Hollywood and the Holocaust; an almost-love
story that--because nothing is ever simple with Godard--is framed
against the struggle to make art in a world that largely ignores it.</LD>
<LD>   At the anguished center of all these ideas is a brooding young
Parisian named Edgar (Bruno Putzulu), whose resemblance to the film's
director as a brooding young genius is surely less than coincidental.
When the film opens, Edgar is auditioning a young woman for a project
he lyrically describes as "the four moments of love--the meeting, the
physical passion, the separation, then the reconciliation."</LD>
<LD>   Edgar doesn't yet know what form his project will take (he's
nothing if not vague and confused), whether it will be a play, a
novel, a film or an opera. All he knows is that he wants three
different couples to embody love in its youth, its adulthood and its
old age, and that the youngest will carry the names Eglantine and
Perceval, she after an Old World rose, he after one of Arthur's
knights, seeker of the holy grail.</LD>
<TE>   Shrouded in solitude, head bowed as if by the sheer heaviness of
his thoughts, Edgar is being supported in his venture by a certain
Mr. Rosenthal (Claude Baigneres), a businessman who, with the help of
lawyers, tracks down artwork stolen from Jews during World War II.
Rosenthal's father once ran a gallery with Edgar's grandfather and as
a young boy Rosenthal had been in love with Edgar's aunt, who later
committed suicide. Now in his mid-60s, Rosenthal is trying to pay
some form of personal restitution by righting history's wrongs, while
also helping Edgar make something of his life. "Something," sighs the
older man, "more than money."</TE>
<TE>   Edgar's story, shot in luxuriant black-and-white celluloid, comes
to us piecemeal, in snatches of dialogue and scenes that open and
close like slamming doors. There isn't much plot but there is a
wealth of complication. Faces fade in and out, bodies enter rooms,
then disappear for good. Edgar searches for actors, running them
through his lines. "I don't know how memory can help us reclaim our
lives," recites one older woman. "It's not whether man will endure,"
answers Edgar. "But whether he has a right to."</TE>
<TE>   Time passes, imperceptibly. One afternoon, Edgar meets with the
godfather of a woman named Berthe (Cecile Camp) and learns that she's
recently killed herself. With a small jolt, we discover that nearly a
year has slipped by in the space of a few edits: What we thought was
the present tense has eased into the past.</TE>
<TE>   Minutes before (or maybe it was months), Edgar had asked Berthe to
participate in his project. She had declined, saying that she didn't
believe she was beautiful enough for him. The second time they'd met
it had been in front of a shuttered Renault factory, a crumbling
mausoleum that Edgar had eulogized as an empty fortress. "There's
always a voice somewhere," Berthe said, before whispering something
into his ear (we never hear what.) A year later, her godfather tells
Edgar that Berthe had wanted to leave him a book. Rummaging through a
suitcase of her things, the godfather pulls out a copy of Christa
Wolf's "Cassandra" and an obscure novel titled "Le Voyage d'Edgar"
moments before the film switches from black and white film to violent
digital-video color.</TE>
<TE>   What follows is a bracing plunge into the past. We discover that
three years earlier Edgar had traveled to Brittany to research yet a
different project, a cantata he hoped to write for Simone Weil, the
French philosopher and mystic who starved to death during World War
II. While there, he had met two elderly resistance fighters, Jean and
Francoise Bayard (Jean Davy and Francoise Verny), then in the midst
of selling the rights to their lives to an outfit called "Spielberg
and Associates." An American sales agent explains to the old couple
that the film will be titled "Tristan and Isolde." The role of Isolde
has been promised to Juliette Binoche, hot off of an Academy Award
win; the screenwriter will be William Styron, author of such
historical pastiches as "Sophie's Choice" and "The Confessions of Nat
Turner."</TE>
<TE>   Since it screened at the Toronto Film Festival last
September--after an enthusiastic and distinctly un-scandalous
premiere at Cannes in May--"In Praise of Love" has been knocked for
all the usual complaints leveled against Godard's work (nothing makes
sense) as well as the charge that it's anti-American. If not for the
political tenor of these times, the accusation could be simply
shrugged off as silly. Because this is one specific moment in time,
however, as Godard might put it, the charge is worth addressing
because it seems little more than a smoke screen for the anxieties
that difficult art, and difficult movies in particular, often
provoke.</TE>
<TE>   Godard has been stretching the limits of narrative since the
release of "Breathless" in 1959; no director with this sort of
marquee value has dedicated himself so consistently and at times
tediously to such radical experimentation. He's routinely forsaken
and rediscovered, and while he makes at least one film a year he's
best known and loved for his earliest features, steeped as they are
in pop-cultural joie de vivre and an anguished romanticism that
flatter young audiences. In the last couple of decades, the work has
been characterized by further experientialism, notably in video and
television, and his reputation has, at least in this country, waned
precipitously. The last time Godard received as much attention here
was in the early 1980s during his dust-up with the Catholic Church
over "Hail Mary," his delicate telling of the life of Mary of
Nazareth.</TE>
<TE>   "In Praise of Love" will likely seem as heretical to some as "Hail
Mary." Here, though, the heresy is committed against another
god--Steven Spielberg, though less the man than the blockbuster
auteur who goes by that name. For Godard, the director of
"Schindler's List" is a metonym, a symbol of the way Hollywood lays
claim to the past as if history were something that could be bought
and sold as truth. This idea is underscored several times, most
emphatically during a scene in which the resistance fighters
negotiate away their life stories. The Bayards'
representative--Berthe, their granddaughter and Edgar's
friend--challenges the American sales agents on their national
identity. "Which united states do you mean," Berthe asks. "See? You
don't have a name. No wonder you need other people's stories."</TE>
<TE>   The lines are pure Godard and purely polemical, and some critics
have balked at them for being ostensibly anti-American. It depends on
how you listen. As is always the case with this filmmaker, it depends
on how you look, too: There's a reason that the first thing we read
in the color section of the film is a road sign warning "Attention
Enfants." Polemics has always been a weapon in Godard's rhetorical
arsenal and there's something almost intentionally crude about the
jabs, which have the sting of provocation more than of condemnation.</TE>
<TE>   Like Edgar, Berthe has an uneasy grasp on history. It isn't that
she's wrong about America, though her jabs elide the fact that if we
look elsewhere for stories it's because elsewhere is where most of us
come from. It's that no matter how fiercely she longs to guard her
grandparents' past neither it nor their stories belong to her.</TE>
<TE>   Still, the past weighs on Berthe; Edgar may carry a load of heavy
thoughts but her history will always be heavier. As the second half
of the film unfolds, we discover that her death is inextricably
linked both to her grandparents' lives and to the staggering price
they paid in their fight to free France, a country that wasn't
universally eager for liberation.</TE>
<TE>   It would be overstating the case to claim that "In Praise of Love"
is Godard's rebuttal to "Schindler's List." Godard has more on his
mind than that, even if Hollywood is clearly never far from his
thoughts. What Godard has in mind is history and memory and their
respective demands, as well as the ways in which movies can both fail
the truth and affirm it. In this sense, he's not asking the familiar
question (is it right to make a fiction film about the Holocaust?),
he's asking the question that usually goes unspoken (where would you
start?). How do you reconcile a love for Paris and all it represents
with the country that shipped its Jews to their deaths? I'm not sure
that Godard knows the answer to this question; only that it's one
that needs asking.</TE>
<TE>   During Edgar's black-and-white reverie, the camera glides through
Paris, sweeping over buildings groaning with history and the
fountains at the Place de Concorde, romantic tours that often come to
a halt at one of the war memorials found throughout the city. Now a
touristic paradise, Paris was also once a battlefield, a place of
resistance. For Godard, the resistance started some 50 years ago with
the start of a revolution called the French New Wave and it's still
going strong. Which is why instead of a story about the Triumph of
the Human Spirit in the face of catastrophe, Godard instead gives us
a complex meditation on history and memory constructed out of
fragments of stories. It's also why he asks more questions than he
can answer, with a tenderness that's not always been evident in his
work. It is, after all, worth remembering that after Berthe takes the
Americans to task, she adds, "You're like us."</TE>
<TE>   Those three words may not seem like much but in the context of
this exhilarating, difficult film, and in the context of Godard's
lifework, the words have the feel of an embrace. Godard has always
made films that are as thrilling for their ideas and ideals as for
the sheer beauty of their images; the difference here is that for the
first time in years he's more interested in turning us on than in
turning us off. He really did think movies could change the world and
he still does.</TE>

<HD>In 'Fedunn,' a Holocaust That Never Ends</HD>
<DH>Murray Mednick's rich, difficult and fantastically
intricate new play probes a painful legacy.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>F. KATHLEEN FOLEY</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In "Fedunn" at the Odyssey Theatre, veteran playwright Murray Mednick
returns to a subject that has increasingly preoccupied him in recent
years--the emotional turmoil of Jews in the immediate aftermath of
the Holocaust, and the dreadful emotional legacy of that genocide.</LD>
<LD>   "Mrs. Feuerstein," presented last season by Padua Playwrights'
Productions at 2100 Square Feet, dealt with the individual
psychological torment of the play's eponymous heroine, herself a
survivor of the death camps. Set in a small Borscht Belt hotel in
1948, "Fedunn" is a roiling, digressive display of anguish in the
aggregate, focusing on a stunned but resilient group of American Jews
struggling to come to terms with the ghastly recent revelations in
Europe.</LD>
<LD>   Masterfully directed by Mitchell Ryan, and acted with wrenching
authority by a superb cast, "Fedunn" represents a career watershed
for Mednick, who had already recently raised the bar of his own
accomplishments with the remarkable "Joe and Betty," an
autobiographically inspired examination of marital dysfunction, also
set in the Catskills.</LD>
<TE>   "Fedunn's" period and locale are flawlessly re-created through
Gary Randall's set, Rand Ryan's lighting and Shon LeBlanc's costumes.
The small and struggling Catskills hotel, the microcosm for "Fedunn,"
is owned by three brothers: Leon (William Bumiller), a Hollywood
producer in town for a rare visit; Pinnie (Joel Polis), the volatile
workhorse of the business; and Ray (Michael Pasternak), a failed
comedian whose beloved wife, Tali (Maia Danziger), is dying.</TE>
<TE>   The complicated skein of familial and personal relationships
stretches to include Al (Travis Michael Holder), a non-Jew who
sacrificed his own flourishing business in Europe to save Tali from
the Nazis, and Tali's beautiful niece Gina (Bari Hochwald), who also
escaped the Nazis through a series of humiliating and psychologically
scarring shifts. Then there's Hesh (Evan Arnold), a junkie
saxophonist and brother of Pinnie's indulgent wife, Eve (Elizabeth
Tobias).</TE>
<TE>   The troublesome, eloquent philosopher of the group is Eli (Matt
Gottlieb), short for Elijah. In contrast to his angry wife, Rosie
(Dinah Lenney), for whom the Holocaust ended all religious faith,
Eli's scientific skepticism has given way to agonized theological
reflection and a nascent belief in God.</TE>
<TE>   When Fedunn (Zoltan), a Ukrainian goy from the nearby town, begins
haunting Tali's sickroom for mysterious reasons, these embattled and
resentful Jews teeter on the edge of violence.</TE>
<TE>   A spiritual descendant of Clifford Odets' "Awake and Sing,"
Mednick's rich, difficult and fantastically intricate drama could
well have been titled "Awake and Wail." In his hopeful lamentation,
Mednick deals with concerns both epic and elemental, from arcane
intellectual ponderings to a glass of tea savored by a dying woman.
It is a virtuosic offering from one of our most distinguished
playwrights, a writer whose sense of outrage is exquisitely balanced
by an overriding humanity.</TE>

<HD>Seamus Blake Floors the Sax to Blazing Speed</HD>
<DH></DH>

<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Cerritos Center for the Performing Arts kicked off its new Sierra
Nights series Wednesday with a performance by the quartet of jazz
tenor saxophonist Seamus Blake. The program was the first of a
monthly series, held on Wednesday nights in the intimate setting of
the Sierra Room Theatre, a room that, like the large Cerritos Center
auditorium, can be formatted differently for programs ranging from
jazz and cabaret to classical music and special events.</LD>
<LD>   Blake was an unusual choice to start the series. He has been well
regarded by his contemporaries since he made his first recording,
with drummer Victor Lewis' band, nearly a decade ago. But he has not
exactly had high visibility until earlier this year, when he won the
2002 Thelonious Monk Jazz Competition.</LD>
<LD>   In his Sierra Room set, Blake displayed the sort of talent that
can be extremely effective in a competitive setting: a technical
mastery of his instrument combined with a playing style emphasizing
high-speed, improvisational flights. Sticking mostly to original
pieces, he began the evening in somewhat tentative fashion, not quite
managing to max out his solo expansiveness until the final pair of
numbers. In those selections, in which his blazing speed was applied
toward textural and dramatic goals, Blake offered a taste of his real
potential.</LD>
<TE>   He was impressively proficient. What was missing, though, was the
sort of wide-open eclecticism present in his other
activities--performing with the electronically oriented Bloomdaddies
group as well as playing in the saxophone section of the Mingus Big
Band. In addition, Blake's compositions are not yet up to the level
of his playing, and his performance would have been enhanced by a
larger quotient of more demanding musical settings.</TE>
<TE>   Those carps aside, he is clearly a player to watch, once he finds
a more effective focus for his abilities.</TE>
<TE>   Pianist Kevin Hays, filling in for the originally scheduled Dave
Kikowski, was a solid accompanist, if a somewhat less compelling
soloist. Larry Grenadier provided, as always, a solid bass
foundation. And drummer Bill Stewart, contributing some of the
evening's most gripping moments, kept the music rhythmically and
creatively alive.</TE>

<AU>Howard Rosenberg</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Many of us in the media are potentially compromised these days, if
only because we work for conglomerates whose sprawling interests cut
across our news beats.</LD>
<LD>   On a less cosmic level, though, media conflicts of interests
should be easy for all to spot. For example:</LD>
<LD>   It was a lovely eulogy, heartfelt and warm, that Anna Song gave at
a public memorial service for two girls who were kidnapped and
murdered in Oregon City, Ore. She was tender, she was compassionate,
and there was no cause to question her sincerity.</LD>
<TE>   Only her judgment.</TE>
<TE>   Thousands of mourners had packed the high school gymnasium on a
Thursday night to hear speakers celebrate Ashley Pond, 12, and
Miranda Gaddis, 13, whose remains were found recently in the backyard
of Ward Weaver III, a 39-year-old convict with an alleged history of
violence against females.</TE>
<TE>   The murders have attracted national press attention at a time when
children going missing are television's crusade du jour and a means
for the least savory of newscasters to use tragedy to present
themselves sympathetically as victims' extended families. The
self-serving message to viewers goes something like this: We care
like family because we are family.</TE>
<TE>   Ashley and Miranda were best friends and neighbors who vanished
eight weeks apart. Although Weaver had publicly proclaimed himself a
prime suspect, it took authorities months to discover the bodies
buried on his rental property near the apartment complex where the
girls lived. He has not been indicted for the murders, however, and
remains in jail on an unrelated rape charge.</TE>
<TE>   The televised Aug. 29 memorial attracted an overflow crowd.
Screens were mounted on the school's roof to beam the service to
those watching outside from the softball field, and a video of the
ceremony has been available on the Web site of KATU-TV, the ABC
station in Oregon City.</TE>
<TE>   One by one, speakers went to the podium. The event's organizer,
Oregon City Christian Church youth pastor Ken Swatman, spoke first.
The city's police chief spoke. One of Ashley's favorite teachers
spoke. The principal of the middle school attended by the girls
spoke.</TE>
<TE>   As did others, including family members and Song.</TE>
<TE>   She spoke for nearly five minutes. Although her voice faltered
occasionally, there was no false emotion or manipulation in the words
she read.</TE>
<TE>   She mentioned that Ashley and Miranda touched her life during the
months residents and authorities searched for them, and how they
became "members of our own families." Picking up on a theme expressed
by others in TV interviews, Song twice urged everyone to close their
eyes and imagine the girls smiling.</TE>
<TE>   "Can you see them clearly?" she asked. "Can you see what they are
doing? They are smiling."</TE>
<TE>   Her eulogy was earnest, dignified and moving, and when she
finished, she was applauded warmly. Then a quartet sang "Amazing
Grace."</TE>
<TE>   One problem, though.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike the others speaking about Ashley and Miranda that night,
Anna Song is a reporter. Not just any reporter, but a prominent
member of the KATU "coverage team" attached to this story.</TE>
<TE>   Oregon City is a community of 26,200 just 20 miles south of
Portland where Song, a Taiwan native, grew up, became Miss American
Teen in 1993 and represented her high school as a Portland Rose
Festival princess two years later.</TE>
<TE>   Although she had interviewed Miranda briefly at a bus stop in
January about Ashley's disappearance shortly before Miranda herself
vanished, she didn't know the girls or their families personally
before this story evolved. Despite its closeness to a metropolis,
however, Oregon City is a small town where reporters are more likely
than their bigger-city counterparts to be tugged by ties of
friendship with sources they encounter on a daily basis. Hence,
Song's eulogy, which went over big with locals.</TE>
<TE>   Even so, it transformed her into an activist, and would fit nicely
into the "Conflicts of Interest" chapter of any book on journalism
ethics.</TE>
<TE>   However well meaning, in other words, Song crossed a line,
violating a basic tenet of journalism by participating in a story she
was supposed to be observing as a reporter, as an outsider.</TE>
<TE>   And she knew it, for she began her remarks at the memorial by
saying this: "Usually as journalists we do everything we can to avoid
getting involved in the stories we do ... " Then she went ahead and
ignored that wise tradition.</TE>
<TE>   As some others had before her.</TE>
<TE>   If anything, this rather obscure incident is a microcosm of
something dangerous that is edging forward nationally: a blurring of
lines separating news media and newsmakers in television. It's a
growing trend that threatens to erode the independence of journalists
working on the small screen.</TE>
<TE>   That includes newscasting's celebrity journalists being on a cozy
first-name basis with many of their interview subjects, including
those occupying the loftiest towers of government.</TE>
<TE>   And in the 1980s, it included the late Wayne Satz acting as
KABC-TV's lead reporter covering alleged child abuse at the McMartin
school while secretly sleeping with a key prosecution witness.</TE>
<TE>   So there are far more egregious examples of media conflict than
Anna Song publicly praising two young victims of murder about which
there appears to be no difference of opinion.</TE>
<TE>   Yet cross one ethical line and it's that much easier to cross
another.</TE>
<TE>   It was Swatman, the youth pastor, who asked Song to speak at the
memorial, she told Times reporter Dana Calvo in Oregon City recently.
"It was ... an honor to be asked," Song said. "It wasn't an easy
decision. We thought about it. We collaborated, my news director and
I."</TE>
<TE>   Song is little more than a callow youngster in the news business,
having been a full-time reporter for only two years after attending
Pepperdine University in Los Angeles and spending a year as an intern
at KABC-TV here and another at KATU.</TE>
<TE>   But her boss, a 20-year news veteran, should have known better.</TE>
<TE>   "It was my decision," KATU news director Mike Rausch told Calvo.
"Anna had questions about it. But I thought we should think about it
from the [viewpoint] of Oregon, not from the viewpoint of fairness."</TE>
<TE>   Not that he found fairness an issue, seeing no difference between
Song "giving her opinion [at the memorial] and a reporter writing a
column." The distinction, though, is significant. Reporters are not
hired to write columns or commentaries. They report stories, which
are meant to exclude opinion. Commentaries (like this one) are
written by columnists and labeled as opinion.</TE>
<TE>   Song remains on the story, meanwhile. Earlier this week, she was
outside Lincoln Memorial Cemetery in Portland, covering the private
burial of Miranda, this time wearing the reporter's hat she shouldn't
have flung away at the memorial.</TE>

<HD>Everyday Life of 'Umberto D.,' 50 Years Later, Is Still
Engaging</HD>
<DH>Directed and co-written by Vittorio De Sica, this classic
of Italian neo-realism finds drama in the simple things.</DH>

<LD>Movie magic here and now means special effects and the wonders only
computers can create. But "Umberto D.," newly restored for its 50th
anniversary, creates magic of a completely different sort. It makes
the unlikeliest subject unforgettable, finding drama, beauty, even
poetry in simple things and simple lives.</LD>
<LD>   Directed by Vittorio De Sica from a screenplay he wrote with
Cesare Zavattini, "Umberto D." is one of the acknowledged classics of
Italian neo-realism. Nominated for an Oscar for best screenplay and
winner of the New York Film Critics award for best foreign film, it
stands alongside "The Bicycle Thief," "Open City" and many others as
part of a post-World War II movement that emphasized authenticity and
truth as core aesthetic values.</LD>
<LD>   But even though half a century and countless trends have come and
gone since "Umberto D.'s" debut, the spell of this very special
film--De Sica's personal favorite and one he dedicated to his
father--has not diminished. As reissued by Rialto Pictures, known for
its superlative restorations of such films as "Contempt," "Band of
Outsiders" and "Pepe Le Moko," this classic reappears in a print so
vivid it's like seeing it for the first time.</LD>
<TE>   According to Rialto, the Italian company Mediaset replaced
defective frames, balanced lighting levels in the print and restored
and filtered the soundtrack. This was done in collaboration with
Giuseppe Rotunno, later to be one of Fellini's favorite
cinematographers ("Amarcord," "Satyricon") but employed in 1952 as
"Umberto D.'s" camera operator.</TE>
<TE>   Though De Sica was himself an accomplished actor (he was even
Oscar-nominated for 1957's "A Farewell to Arms"), as a director,
especially in his neo-realist period, he enjoyed working with
nonprofessionals. "The man in the street," he said, "in the hands of
a director who is at the same time an actor, represents malleable
material that you can mold according to your wishes."</TE>
<TE>   "Umberto D.'s" star, 70-year-old Carlo Battisti, was just such a
nonprofessional, of all things a celebrated professor of philology
from the University of Florence whom De Sica discovered walking to a
lecture on the streets of Rome.</TE>
<TE>   Under De Sica's skillful direction, Battisti gives a compelling
performance, creating a character--very real in his quirks,
stubbornness and particularities--whose dignity and pride in the face
of both encroaching age and life's pitiless vagaries are enthralling.</TE>
<TE>   Umberto Domenico Ferrari is introduced taking part in a street
protest where aged demonstrators brandish signs saying "Old People
Have to Eat, Too" and clutch at their hearts when the police wade in
and break things up.</TE>
<TE>   He is, we gradually find out, a retired civil servant who worked
for 30 years in the ministry of public works. In debt, without family
or friends, at the mercy of a termagant of a landlady who turns his
room into a hot-sheet motel when he's out, Umberto D. is in desperate
need of money to prevent an imminent eviction.</TE>
<TE>   Umberto D.'s main solace and companion in these difficulties is
his Flike, one of the cinema's great canine performers, an energetic,
terrier-like dog described by his owner as "a mongrel with
intelligent eyes." Umberto sneaks the animal food at soup kitchens
and worries about its health and well-being more than his own.</TE>
<TE>   Umberto D.'s other connection to life is Maria (Maria-Pia Casilio,
an apprentice seamstress at the time), his landlady's maid, whose
life is not much more promising than his. She's pregnant, sure to be
thrown out when that fact's discovered, and not sure which of the two
soldiers she's been seeing is the father.</TE>
<TE>   "Umberto D." spends its initial sections watching these two people
go about their daily routines in that apartment. Part of the charm of
this picture is the way nothing is rushed but everything has an
emotional point. Things are happening though it seems like nothing
is, and the film's natural and unobtrusive camerawork (G.R. Aldo is
the cinematographer) is carefully setting us up for eventual crises
without ever letting on that it is doing anything of the sort.</TE>
<TE>   Gradually, the calamities that are threatening come to pass, and
Umberto D. is faced with the loss of everything he values, including
the irreplaceable Flike. Yet through the film's avoidance of special
pleading and the unmatched simplicity of Battisti's performance,
Umberto D. maintains an unshakable dignity through it all.</TE>
<TE>   It was always the dream of screenwriter Zavattini, who also wrote
"Shoeshine" and "The Bicycle Thief," to simply present 90 minutes of
a man's life, and he came closest to that aim here. A government
minister attacked the film when it came out for airing "dirty
laundry" in public and demanded "more constructive" optimism from
Italy's filmmakers. Yet, seen today, it's hard to think of a more
remarkable tribute to the resilience of the human spirit than the one
"Umberto D." puts on the screen.</TE>

<HD>France's Last King</HD>
<DH>Movies* LACMA salutes Jean Gabin, perhaps the greatest
French film star. He starred in a variety of roles but towered as the
common man.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SUSAN KING</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>What was the special magic Jean Gabin wove that made him perhaps the
greatest French film actor of the 20th century? As is true of most
film stars, his power was undeniable and undefinable.</LD>
<LD>   The former song-and-dance man held the audience in his spell for
46 years and, nearly three decades after his death, no actor has been
able to replace him in the hearts of his countrymen.</LD>
<LD>   French film critic Andre Bazin once described Gabin as "the tragic
hero of contemporary cinema." Sexy and virile, he was both graceful
and two-fisted, tough and tender. He excelled at playing the tortured
everyman whose life ends tragically, usually because of his love for
an unattainable woman: a pessimistic romantic.</LD>
<TE>   "He is simply one of the most incredible French film actors," says
Mohamed Bendjebbour, head of the film and TV department of the French
Consulate in Los Angeles. "As my grandmother used to say, she wanted
to date him, and her husband, my grandfather, wanted to be him."</TE>
<TE>   Part of the credit for his success rests with his tailor; no one
wore beautiful clothes quite so perfectly as Gabin. In each of his
films--especially during his matinee idol years in the 1930s--his
clothing reflected each of his character's personalities and demons.</TE>
<TE>   The natty tailored suits that draped his body like a second skin
personified his role as the infamous sexy gangster in "Pepe le Moko."
In "Gueule d'amour," he turned the heads of women as a French Foreign
Legion Casanova in his flowing white trousers. And even the
form-fitting suits, ties, sweaters and neck scarfs he wore as a
mentally troubled railway man in "La Bete Humaine" reflected the
character's pent-up rage and violent emotions.</TE>
<TE>   Some of Gabin's greatest roles--and costumes--can be seen
beginning tonight at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art's
three-week tribute to the late actor, "Le Grand Gabin."</TE>
<TE>   The series, which is being presented by LACMA's film department
and the French Consulate's film and TV department, opens with his
seminal performance in "Le Jour se leve," a searing 1939 melodrama
directed by Marcel Carne and penned by Jacques Prevert in which Gabin
plays a doomed young factory worker who reflects on how he became a
murderer. Also featured on the bill is "Gueule d'amour' (1936), in
which Gabin's "lady killer" tragically meets his match in the form of
mysterious seductress.</TE>
<TE>   "Especially in the '30s, he was a really handsome guy, really very
masculine, almost macho," Bendjebbour says. "Director Jean Renoir
used to say that the range of feelings Jean Gabin can show and
express are limitless. The difference with other actors is that he
feels the feelings of the characters."</TE>
<TE>   Renoir directed Gabin in some of his great performances, notably
in "La Bete Humaine" (1938), which screens Sept. 14. One of the
film's indelible moments finds Gabin walking briskly along a railway
track after murdering his girlfriend in a mad rage. His face is a
blank canvas--one doesn't know if he is going to commit another
murder or kill himself. It's a powerful scene that's simple in its
execution and beautifully portrayed.</TE>
<TE>   Gabin downplayed his talent. "He used to say that he was born
lazy," Bendjebbour says. "But it was a born talent. He worked a lot
on his characters, and so this is why he succeeded in showing so many
emotions and feelings. He was great until the end."</TE>
<TE>   Gabin, he says, was never afraid to say why he picked certain
films. "He said that some movies were real, that is to say he loved
making them. Others he did to get paid, to pay taxes. But I think
every movie he did was of historical value.</TE>
<TE>   Born Jean-Alexis Moncorge in Paris in 1904, Gabin worked as a day
laborer before becoming a popular singer and dancer at the Folies
Bergere. He was a boulevardier singer very much in the mode of
Maurice Chevalier, and CDs of his early recordings are available.</TE>
<TE>   He segued to movies in 1930, and stardom soon followed. "Le Grand
Gabin" features several of the films he made in the 1930s, including
Renoir's 1937 antiwar epic "La Grande Illusion" (Saturday), in which
he plays a French POW, and the 1938 Carne-Prevert collaboration,
"Quai des brumes" (Sept. 13), in which he plays another tragic
figure, this time an army deserter who becomes involved with an
orphan girl, a criminal kingpin and a suicidal artist.</TE>
<TE>   Gabin visited America briefly in the early '40s but made more of a
name for himself as Marlene Dietrich's lover. He made only two films
in America, including the 1942 drama "Moontide," which screens Sept.
14. Although his accent makes him difficult to understand at times,
he gives a moving performance as a fisherman who believes he may have
accidentally killed a man and who ends up saving a young woman (Ida
Lupino) from a suicide attempt.</TE>
<TE>   Gabin returned to Europe to fight the Nazis, then picked up where
he left off after the war, playing a more mature version of his '30s
self. He continued to act until his death in 1976. The LACMA festival
highlights Gabin's post-World War II work, including the 1949 film
"La Marie du port" (Sept. 13), which reunited him with Carne and
Prevert. He plays a world-weary restaurant owner who travels to his
father's funeral with his mistress and ends up falling for her
younger sister.</TE>
<TE>   The series concludes Sept. 21 with a terrific double bill: "Le
Plaisir," Max Ophuls' 1952 anthology drama in which he plays a simple
farmer who encounters a beautiful sophisticate (Danielle Darrieux),
and Renoir's 1955 Technicolor delight "French Cancan," in which Gabin
gives an irrepressible joyous performance as the man who revived the
dance form.</TE>
<TE>   Bendjebbour reports that Gabin was a difficult man. "He was very
demanding," he says. "But he was appreciated by everybody who worked
with him. Alain Delon, when he talks about working with him, he says
it was one of the best experiences ever."</TE>
<TE>   His funeral played out like a scene from one of his films. After
he died of a heart attack, his body was cremated and his ashes were
thrown overboard from the military ship Detroyat.</TE>

<HD>New York's Theater Artists Pull Together for Attack
Memorial</HD>
<DH>Stage* Name actors, writers and others plan 'Brave New
World,' three days of benefit shows exploring Sept. 11 events and its
aftermath.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KARIN LIPSON</AU>
<BD>NEWSDAY</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>When Bebe Neuwirth was invited to take part in "Brave New World," a
three-day theater marathon commemorating the attacks of Sept. 11, she
wasn't sure she wanted to.</LD>
<LD>   "I was very reluctant to do anything gratuitous ... anything that
would be interpreted as disrespectful," recalled Neuwirth, a star of
the new film "Tadpole," former star of the musical "Chicago" and TV's
dragon lady Lilith on "Cheers."</LD>
<LD>   But talking with the event's organizers allayed her concerns, as
did the company she'll be keeping in "Brave New World," which runs
Monday through Wednesday at Manhattan's Town Hall and benefits the
New York Children's Foundation.</LD>
<TE>   "I thought, 'Gee, there's an awful lot of very, very classy people
involved with this,' " she said. Among the 75 or so actors scheduled
to take part are Sigourney Weaver; "Sex and the City" co-stars
Kristin Davis and Cynthia Nixon; Edie Falco and Stanley Tucci (stars
of Broadway's "Frankie and Johnny in the Clair de Lune"); Stockard
Channing ("The West Wing"); Chris Noth ("Sex and the City"); Dana
Ivey; Frank Langella; Marisa Tomei; and Julianna Margulies.</TE>
<TE>   They will be presenting about 50 plays, songs and poems, most no
more than 10 to 15 minutes long and written for the occasion by John
Guare, Terrence McNally, Beth Henley, Tina Howe, David Henry Hwang,
Lanford Wilson, Arthur Kopit and others.</TE>
<TE>   Some playwrights and actors hesitated initially, for a variety of
reasons: Did they have something new to say? Could they face reliving
those catastrophic events? Would any form of entertainment seem, in
Neuwirth's words, "gratuitous"?</TE>
<TE>   In the end, though, they seemed to agree with Ivey, who will
perform in plays by Alfred Uhry and Christopher Durang: "Many people
are going to memorialize the day in different ways. And this is the
way that the theater arts community can do it."</TE>
<TE>   (A separate benefit event under the "Brave New World" umbrella,
"The 24 Hour Plays" presented Monday at the Minetta Lane Theater,
will be the culmination of a 24-hour workshop of writers, directors,
actors and staff.)</TE>
<TE>   But how to get everyone together for three days? And whose idea
was this?</TE>
<TE>   It was the brainchild of playwright J. Dakota Powell, who lost a
relative in the collapse of the World Trade Center. About a month
after the attacks, she said, "a play popped out of me." Called
"Exodus," it reflects Powell's heritage: Her grandfather was a
Harvard physicist who helped develop the atom bomb; her Chinese
Japanese mother had to evacuate Tokyo as a child because of U.S.
firebombing of the city.</TE>
<TE>   "So I wrote a piece that interweaves monologues about my family,
because I am East and West," Powell said. Although the specifics
differ, the conflict in "Exodus" suggests a new East-West cultural
conflict behind last year's attacks.</TE>
<TE>   Soon, enlisting the help of a co-organizer, director Erica Gould,
Powell began to call writer friends who might also want to express
themselves.</TE>
<TE>   They included screenwriter and playwright John Patrick Shanley,
who contributed "Alive," a song to which he had written the lyrics.</TE>
<TE>   When Powell approached Shanley, "she was bandying about many, many
people I had heard of. I just didn't know if she'd gone off her
medication," Shanley joked. "It seemed a little farfetched to me.
Then she told me it would be at Town Hall, and I said I guess she's
going to do it."</TE>
<TE>   Major actors began to sign on once "we had a critical mass of
playwrights," Powell said. Networking and sheer serendipity also
played a part: Ivey and Uhry were approached independently, and Uhry
specifically asked to write something for Ivey, who had starred in
his "Driving Miss Daisy" and "The Last Night of Ballyhoo." The result
is "The Other Line."</TE>
<TE>   Certainly no source was more unusual than Ensign Charles Evered of
the Navy Reserve, whose "Adopt a Sailor" will feature Neuwirth as a
downtown gallery owner who witnesses the attacks. Her university
professor husband doesn't, and he responds to the events very
differently from his wife--a sure sign of marital trouble ahead. And
yes, there is a sailor (Neil Patrick Harris), in town for the annual
Fleet Week, who is "adopted" for dinner by the couple.</TE>
<TE>   Creating "Adopt a Sailor" had a liberating effect on Evered. A
produced playwright and assistant professor of communications at
Emerson College in Boston, he was, he acknowledges, traumatized by
having been at ground zero on Navy business two days after the
attack: "It was that experience of being on the site and seeing what
I saw that changed me for the rest of my life."</TE>
<TE>   So he shied away from grappling with those events again. "Then I
had a kind of give-and-take with my wife, who thought it would be
healthy to deal with it on some level," Evered said.</TE>
<TE>   "And by the next morning, I had a first draft."</TE>

<HD>Celebrities, Spiders and Snakes: A British 'Reality' Hit
Maroons B-List Names</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>LONDON</DL>
<LD>A boxer, a socialite, a lesbian comedian and psychic Uri Geller sit
in a jungle clearing. It sounds like a joke. But it's a moment from
Britain's latest unscripted, staged TV hit.</LD>
<LD>   "I'm a Celebrity ... Get Me Out of Here" strands eight
publicity-hungry personalities in the Australian jungle, where they
must survive on rice and water, contend with spiders and snakes--and
wait to be voted off, one by one, by the viewing public.</LD>
<LD>   Like their counterparts around the world, British viewers have
embraced staged, unscripted TV, to the chagrin of some cultural
commentators who see it as voyeurism run amok. "Big Brother," in
which a group of strangers shares a house under constant
surveillance, has gone through three hit series and spawned a
celebrity spinoff.</LD>
<TE>   Among the "celebrities" on "I'm a Celebrity" are former world
middleweight boxing champion Nigel Benn; Tara Palmer-Tomkinson, a
socialite famous for her partying and drug woes; and Christine
Hamilton, wife of bankrupt former politician Neil Hamilton.</TE>
<TE>   "Let's be honest: You're not going to get A-list celebrities to
spend two weeks in the middle of the Australian jungle," said Will
Smith of London Weekend Television. "The success of the format
doesn't depend on whether people are A-list, B-list or whatever, but
that you have a group of characters that people recognize and have an
opinion about."</TE>
<TE>   Though it has been called "Celebrity Survivor," the show lacks the
"Survivor" emphasis on competition. There is no prize money, and most
of the money raised from the telephone voting lines will be donated
to charity. The final show is to be broadcast Sunday.</TE>

<HD>'Idol' and Clarkson Both Win</HD>
<DH>Television* The Fox series finale outdraws NBC, ABC and CBS
combined, despite voting problems such as a possible scam.</DH>

<LD>Fox's "American Idol" finale was a clear hit on the rating charts,
although a number of viewers are still smarting over the voting
system, including an apparent independent scam perpetrated on some of
those who called in to register their votes.</LD>
<LD>   Ratings for Wednesday night indicate that 22.8 million people were
watching the program at any given moment, based on Nielsen Media
Research estimates. That exceeds the combined audience for NBC, ABC
and CBS during those two hours.</LD>
<LD>   Viewing steadily built over the evening, peaking at nearly 28
million in the last half-hour, which saw Kelly Clarkson emerge as the
talent showcase's winner over Justin Guarini.</LD>
<TE>   Although far short of the nearly 52 million people who watched the
concluding installment of the first "Survivor" two years ago, the
audience represented the largest for any Fox telecast, other than
sports, since an episode of "Malcolm in the Middle" in January 2000.
Viewership was comparable to that for new episodes of such top-rated
series as "Friends" or "CSI: Crime Scene Investigation," an
especially impressive feat in the summer, when overall TV viewing
tends to be lower.</TE>
<TE>   The program was hugely popular among young women and teenage
girls, demographics in which the numbers of females tuning in
exceeded their male counterparts by 50% or more.</TE>
<TE>   Still, for all the benefits the show generated for Fox--among them
providing a platform to promote its upcoming lineup of new
series--glitches surrounding the voting system left a portion of fans
feeling irked by the process.</TE>
<TE>   Some viewers insist the outcome was manipulated, that they
constantly reached a busy signal when calling and that so-called
"power dialers"--people who used computers and automated systems to
register thousands of votes for favorite contestants each
week--skewed the results. The producers have said that practice was
statistically insignificant, with Fox receiving more than 15 million
calls in selecting the winner.</TE>
<TE>   Several people on Web sites also reported calling the show's
toll-free number only to be directed to a 900 number that charged
them $1.99 a call. According to Fox, those who heard that recording
misdialed--punching in an 800 prefix instead of the 866 line
established by the network. Fox says it had no affiliation with the
other number, which the network believes to be a scheme to cash in on
the show's popularity.</TE>
<TE>   "Someone figured out that people would misdial and [they] are
trying to profit from it.... Of course the votes wouldn't go through
and you'd just lose your money ... how awful!" one viewer posted on
msn.com.</TE>
<TE>   Robert Blacher, an attorney who lives in Lake Worth, Fla., was
among those who says he tried to call in and found himself referred
to the 900 number. Even if Fox wasn't involved, Blacher said, the
network had a duty to alert viewers.</TE>
<TE>   "As a matter of good citizenship, they should have warned people,"
he said.</TE>
<TE>   Executives at FremantleMedia, meanwhile, the British company
responsible for the series as well as for previous editions overseas,
are gearing up for the sequel. They said Thursday that auditions for
the next "Idol" would be held in the fall, with plans to launch the
show early next year.</TE>
<TE>   A few changes are expected, including the possible addition of a
fourth judge. Having already produced versions in Britain, Poland and
South Africa, Fremantle will next take the series to Germany and
Belgium.</TE>

<HD>Boy Meets Girl; Girl Becomes Glenn Close</HD>
<DH>But this predictable teenage take on the 'Fatal Attraction'
formula goes from dumb to even dumber.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MANOHLA DARGIS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Ripped from the pages of the "See Dick Run, See Jane Stalk Him"
handbook, the thrill-less thriller "Swimfan" is as dumb as it gets.
Teenage boy with teenage girlfriend beds teenage girl who isn't his
girlfriend. The latter turns out to be psycho. (She has a fatal
attraction.) Add pet bunny.</LD>
<LD>   Stir.</LD>
<LD>   When Adrian Lyne's "Fatal Attraction" was released in 1987, the
nastily enjoyable cautionary tale caused a minor scandal because it
looked as fresh as the post-feminist moment. Its shocks and
ham-fisted morality had been lifted from scads of earlier films, but
no matter; audiences everywhere pointed thumbs down at the blond who
would be Michael Douglas' queen.</LD>
<TE>   If the psycho-stalker story looks less fresh now, it's in part
because real life has a way of making cheap stories look cheaper:
There are simply too many sad newspaper stories out in the world to
make a stalker thriller the first choice in evening entertainment.
Then there's the fact that after all this time it may be OK to admit
that Glenn Close's character--the wild woman who crawled into the
married man's bed only to end up dead in his bathtub--was really the
film's tragic heroine. Surely I'm not the only one who was sorry to
see this tough broad die, especially on account of such a
pusillanimous louse.</TE>
<TE>   Louse sums up the guy in "Swimfan," as well, and pretty much
everyone else connected with this moldering hash. Varsity high school
swimmer Ben Cronin (Jesse Bradford) meets and intimately greets the
new girl at school, Madison Bell (Erika Christensen), whose Anna
Magnani street-mama wardrobe of cigarette skirts and perilous heels
are instant signals that she and the filmmakers are up to no good.
Faced with such sartorial distractions, and a nearly naked girl
grinding her body into his, Ben has no choice but to make the wrong
choice. One evening, trapped in the deep end of the pool, he pledges
loyalty to his girlfriend, Amy (Shiri Appleby), even as he takes the
(apparently unprotected) plunge with Madison.</TE>
<TE>   Before you know it--and you know this plot kink and every other
development long before they happen--Madison is hunting Ben down,
accompanied by her very own psycho-chick refrain, though here the
shrieking notes sound lifted from an old Carol Burnett sketch instead
of the Bernard Herrmann catalog.</TE>
<TE>   Given the lapses in continuity (entire scenes seem to be missing)
and especially Madison's eye-popping meltdown (which itself summons
up warm memories of classic Burnett), it's too bad that director John
Polson didn't have either the will or the foresight to push the film
to full-blown camp.</TE>
<TE>   The problem is that it's hard to camp up a movie already so deeply
in touch with its exploitative roots: Madison isn't just an average
psycho-stalker, she's one of those vixen's whose decolletage is a
barometer of her mental health, which means the nastier she grows,
the more she shows.</TE>
<TE>   The actors never have a chance. Bradford, an appealing former
child actor who's done fine work in films such as "King of the Hill"
and "Far From Home: The Adventures of Yellow Dog," spends most of the
movie with his mouth hanging open, which is never a wise strategy for
a performer making the transition to older roles. On the other hand,
it's hard to know what to say about Christensen, who spent most of
"Traffic" playing a zonked-out drug addict and here seems to be
auditioning for the Bette Davis role in the prequel to "Whatever
Happened to Baby Jane?" Special mention, however, does go to the
invaluable character actor Dan Hedaya, for playing his role (as Ben's
coach) with the same gravitas he brings to all his performances, and
to a young actor named James Debello, who as Madison's cousin seems
to be the only one here who's in on the joke.</TE>
<TE>   Overly long at even 84 minutes, "Swimfan" sputters to its
inevitable conclusion, preordained by a welter of genre precursors
and an antediluvian attitude to teenage sexuality.</TE>
<TE>   However fundamentally punitive its moralism, "Fatal Attraction"
was at its core riddled with contradictions about men, women and sex;
"Swimfan," on the other hand, isn't any different from those slasher
films that undress girls and boys to get a bead on their vulnerable
flesh--except that it's sometimes pretty funny. Although its
disjointed quality makes it hard to know if the film went wrong
before, during or after production, there's one thing about "Swimfan"
that's crystal clear: Neither Polson nor screenwriters Charles Bohl
and Phillip Schneider, or anyone else connected with the movie, seems
to really like kids. Here's hoping the kids feel the same.</TE>
<TE>   MPAA rating: PG-13, for mature thematic elements, sexual content,
disturbing images and language. Times guidelines: No nudity but some
suggestive sex scenes.</TE>

<HD>TV Forgets One of Its Own</HD>
<DH>Inventor Farnsworth has been overlooked even now, as the
medium he created turns 75.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>FRAZIER MOORE</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>TV goes nuts for anniversaries.</LD>
<LD>   Take last May, when NBC aired specials celebrating 75 years as a
radio and television network, 20 years of "Must-See TV," and a decade
each of "Dateline NBC" and Jay Leno. Meanwhile, ABC staged a golden
anniversary salute to "American Bandstand." Ditto CBS for "The
Honeymooners."</LD>
<LD>   But now, how about some shows to give viewers the big picture? How
about celebrating the birth of television and paying delayed tribute
to television's creator?</LD>
<TE>   It seems to have escaped the networks' notice, but Saturday is the
75th anniversary of the first successful demonstration of television.
Making it happen was Philo T. Farnsworth, who, hardly a household
name, remains television's invisible inventor.</TE>
<TE>   Because the networks won't likely re-enact Farnsworth's big
moment, you'll have to visualize it for yourself. The setting: his
modest San Francisco lab where, on Sept. 7, 1927, the 21-year-old
self-taught genius transmitted the image of a horizontal line to a
receiver in the next room.</TE>
<TE>   Later that day, he triumphantly wired one of his backers in Los
Angeles: "The damned thing works!"</TE>
<TE>   It worked--just like Farnsworth had imagined when, as a
14-year-old Idaho farm boy already obsessed with inventing
television, he had been plowing a field and realized an image could
be scanned onto a picture tube the same way: row by row.</TE>
<TE>   It worked--yet Farnsworth would be denied credit, fame and wealth
befitting the father of the world's most powerful communications
tool.</TE>
<TE>   His sole appearance on national television was as a mystery guest
on the CBS game show "I've Got a Secret" in 1957. He fielded
questions from the celebrity panelists as they tried in vain to guess
his secret ("I invented electronic television"). For stumping them,
Farnsworth took home $80 and a carton of Winston cigarettes.</TE>
<TE>   Forty-five years later (and three decades after his death in
1971), "I've Got a Secret" could still be the slogan for Farnsworth
and his 94-year-old widow, Pem, who worked at his side through much
of his career.</TE>
<TE>   How ironic. In this media-savvy age, not only should his name be
as widely known as Edison's or Ford's, but his long, lean face with
the bulbous brow should be as familiar as any pop icon's.</TE>
<TE>   Saturday would have been a great day for TV to tell Farnsworth's
story.</TE>
<TE>   Picture it: live coverage originating from his laboratory space. A
musical-variety special with TV's biggest stars paying homage to the
man they owe for their livelihood. Every network briefly going to
black to acknowledge where they'd be without Farnsworth. (And that's
just for starters!)</TE>
<TE>   Picture it, but don't bet on it. By now, TV is generally assumed
to be naturally occurring, like water or air.</TE>
<TE>   Anyone who suspects otherwise likely believes that TV's creator
was a then-mighty company called RCA. This is a version of history
RCA was pushing even as its boss, David Sarnoff, tried to crush "The
Last Lone Inventor" (aptly dubbed by a recent Farnsworth biography of
that title). It's a version of history that NBC, which Sarnoff
founded, clearly has no incentive to revise, even today.</TE>
<TE>   Never mind the record says otherwise. In 1935, the courts ruled on
Farnsworth's patent, which RCA was contesting as part of Sarnoff's
endless campaign of litigation, propaganda and dirty tricks. The
decision, upheld on appeal: Farnsworth, not RCA's chief television
engineer, Vladimir Zworykin, is the father of TV.</TE>
<TE>   Now, 75 years after a fuzzy line sparked a revolution, television,
like the nation, is focused on the anniversary that trails Sept. 7 by
four days.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, remembering the 9/11 attacks provides added reason to
appreciate, not overlook, Farnsworth. When covering that tragedy, TV
was at its finest and most indispensable. However unsung, Farnsworth
was part of the effort.</TE>
<TE>   But waiting two more weeks won't make much difference. What about
the Emmy Awards? Airing Sept. 22 on NBC, it would be a fitting
occasion for a give-the-man-his-due show of thanks.</TE>
<TE>   At least, that's the sentiment some Philophiles have conveyed to
the Academy of Television Arts &amp; Sciences and the Emmycast's
executive producer, Gary Smith.</TE>
<TE>   "We are sympathetic to the desire to honor Farnsworth's
accomplishments. They're huge," academy Chairman Bryce Zabel said.</TE>
<TE>   How exactly to do it, he added, "is something that's being talked
about."</TE>
<TE>   Maybe so. But as Farnsworth showed in many ways, what counts is
what people can see.</TE>

<LD>   Band Surprises Salonen on His Home Turf</LD>
<LD>   At the closing concert of its European tour Wednesday night, the
Los Angeles Philharmonic surprised music director Esa-Pekka Salonen
(whose sandy-brown locks are considerably shorter of late). Playing
before a Helsinki crowd, band members waved flags of his native
Finland.</LD>
<TE>   Though reviews from that engagement and this week's Brussels
concerts are not yet in, critics in London, Lucerne and Edinburgh
were generally upbeat about the orchestra.</TE>
<TE>   "Expectations were high and they were amply fulfilled," said a
piece in Lucerne's Tagesanzeiger. "In the last 10 years, the L.A.
Philharmonic has evidently developed qualities which ensure the
highest degree of competence in the widest possible range of
stylistic areas."</TE>
<TE>   London's Guardian was also impressed. "The L.A. Philharmonic
hardly corresponds to the stereotype of front-rank American
orchestras," said critic Andrew Clements. "The strings are not
deep-pile and sonorous but refined and pliant; the brass is neither
butch nor aggressive but projects a purposeful directness; the
woodwind is perfectly detailed." But their performance of
Shostakovich's Second Symphony "could not disguise its faults or
compensate for its lack of coherence," the critic added.</TE>

<TE>   Letterman Joins Late-Night Colleagues</TE>
<TE>   David Letterman, whose shows after last year's terrorist attacks
drew high praise from critics and the public, has decided to do an
original broadcast of his "Late Show" on Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   Letterman's decision, announced Thursday, means that, while the
broadcast networks will give over their prime-time schedules to news
and specials on the one-year anniversary of the terrorist attacks,
the late-night hosts--NBC's Jay Leno and Conan O'Brien and CBS'
Letterman and Craig Kilborn--will all be doing shows that day.</TE>
<TE>   ABC Taken In by Promotional Hoax</TE>
<TE>   Producers of ABC's "Good Morning America" inadvertently served up
a plug for a new drama-reality series airing on the network, Variety
reports.</TE>
<TE>   As weatherman Tony Perkins was chatting with folks outside the
studio, he encountered some fellows who claimed to be members of the
Push, Nev., hockey team. As it happened, there is no such
town--except in ABC's new series of the same name, executive-produced
by Ben Affleck and Sean Bailey. The athletes in question were really
actors hired by ADD--a company employed by ABC to mount a guerrilla
public relations campaign for the show.</TE>
<TE>   No one at ABC News had been advised of the prank, and Perkins was
unaware of the show.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a show that is very different and we are trying to market
it in a different way," an ABC spokesman said. "ADD didn't take into
account the kinds of questions that could arise by enacting this sort
of strategy within the same company."</TE>
<TE>   POP/ROCK</TE>
<TE>   Protest Planned Today Over Rave Legislation</TE>
<TE>   Doc Martin, Richard "Humpty" Vission and Garth Trinidad are among
the electronic music scene notables expected today at a Westwood
rally against a proposed U.S. Senate bill that would sharpen federal
drugs laws to be used against rave promoters.</TE>
<TE>   The organizers of the 3 p.m. rally at the north lawn of the
Federal Building say the bill is a danger to civil liberties and
wrongly targets rave promoters as part of the war on drugs. The
bill's supporters argue that it would only create a more effective
legal tool to use against rave promoters who knowingly foster drug
enterprise at their late-night dance events.</TE>
<TE>   Singer Loses Fingers Responding to Fans</TE>
<TE>   Doctors reattached three fingers to the hand of a 16-year-old pop
singer after they were severed by a helicopter while he was waving to
fans.</TE>
<TE>   Ricardo Abarca, a member of the teen group Mageneto, was getting
off the aircraft at a Guatemala City airport on Saturday. Raising his
hand to greet the crowd, he put it into the still-whirling rotor.</TE>
<TE>   "The index finger and the middle finger are completely recovered,"
surgeon Gustavo Lopez said Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   "We only have some problems with blood circulation in the little
finger."</TE>
<TE>   QUICK TAKES</TE>
<TE>   Former Beatle Paul McCartney and Beach Boys co-founder Brian
Wilson will perform together at the Century Plaza Hotel for a Sept.
18 benefit to raise money for clearance of land mines.... Nia
Vardalos, the writer and star of "My Big Fat Greek Wedding," will
take on the lead role in "Connie and Carla Do L.A.," a female buddy
movie along the lines of "Some Like It Hot." TNT has canceled
"Witchblade" after two seasons.... Martin Short will bring Jiminy
Glick, his weight-challenged talk show host from Comedy Central's
"Primetime Glick," to the big screen in the feature film comedy
"Lalawood".... "The Ring," DreamWorks' remake of a Japanese horror
film, will open the Hollywood Film Festival on Oct. 2 at the Pacific
Grove Theaters. Naomi Watts ("Mulholland Drive") stars.... The WB
will offer a Spanish-language simulcast of its new Latino comedy
series "Greetings From Tucson," premiering Sept. 20.</TE>

<HD>Connelly-Chin Pairing Delivers Dirges and High-Energy Funk</HD>

<LD>Industrial dance music veterans Meg Lee Chin and Chris Connelly both
record for Martin Atkins' venerable Invisible label, and both spent
time in Pigface, the Atkins-led industrial super group in which
numerous underground luminaries have participated. But they revealed
little else in common on Wednesday at the Knitting Factory.</LD>
<LD>   Connelly was in Ministry and industrial trashmeisters the
Revolting Cocks, but some later solo work ventured into the quirky,
depressive territory of '60s oddball Scott Walker. Accompanying
himself on guitar Wednesday, he briskly surveyed his catalog as well
as the recently released album "Private Education." The dirge-like
quality of such numbers as "Prayer" was quickly wearisome, as
Connelly's vibrato-tinged wailing was more tortured than torchy. A
defiant, anthem-like tune did liven things up, but all that painful
sincerity was definitely an acquired taste.</LD>
<LD>   Chin's high-energy headlining turn was a surprisingly funky
affair, with political and social overtones in such numbers as
"Nutopia," her Pigface-era reinvention of Allen Ginsberg's classic
poem "Howl." The Taiwan-born London resident once auditioned for
Garbage, and her music often had a vague similarity to that band's,
mostly in the propulsive electronic intensity. But it felt more
organic and raw, and Chin's vocals were more rapped than sung.</LD>
<TE>   Camouflage-clad and pigtailed, she bellowed and howled while
leading her quartet through selections from 1999's "Piece and Love"
and other works. Far from the industrial music stereotype of being
relentlessly atonal or monochromatic, her sound incorporated hip-hop
rhythms, crunchy dub reggae, herky-jerky soul, thrashy R&amp;B and
hypnotic blues. In short, it came fetchingly close to being pop.
Like, radical.</TE>

<HD>This Glittery Lawn Mower Cuts to the Tough Questions</HD>
<DH>The installation is the highlight of an otherwise academic
survey of the 'Postborder Metropolis.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID PAGEL</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When was the last time you broke out in song doing something you
loved?</LD>
<LD>   Think back. Take your time. Even if you don't have many seconds to
spare for such silly questions. If it helps, include those occasions
you started singing when you were doing something uninteresting, like
sitting in traffic, washing dishes or cutting the lawn.</LD>
<LD>   These are the questions Ruben Ortiz Torres asks visitors to USC's
Fisher Gallery, in whose grand foyer he has parked a customized lawn
mower on a pedestal covered with artificial turf. Painted
glitter-speckled fuchsia and adorned with a gold-plated "Power Tools"
emblem and chain-link steering wheel, the souped-up lawn mower has
also been rigged with a powerful boat battery and hydraulic system.</LD>
<TE>   Titled "The Garden of Earthly Delights," it's accompanied by a
hand-held remote control panel. Pushing various buttons causes the
domestically scaled tractor's hood, fenders, grill and seat to rise
overhead, tip back and forth, flap like wings and spin like
pinwheels.</TE>
<TE>   Nearby, a monitor plays a looped videotape of the lawn mower
dancing to the beat of a pop ditty that fuses the pastoral sounds of
birds chirping, leaves rustling and brooks babbling with the
electronically manipulated noises of hedge clippers, weed whackers
and leaf blowers.</TE>
<TE>   Together, the low-rider lawn mower and homemade music video bring
a smile to your face, a shuffle to your step and a bob to your head.
They also set you to thinking about a world infinitely more wonderful
than the one in which we live. "Imagine what it would be like," Ortiz
Torres' performing hot rod asks, "if manual labor were not dull
drudgery but joyous celebration--something so cool, stylish and fun
that workers all over the world were inspired to customize the tools
of their trades."</TE>
<TE>   These musings lead to thorny economic questions about the
relationship between labor and leisure. Recalling Rosa Luxemburg's
refusal to embrace a revolution that had no time for dancing, Ortiz
Torres' utopian lawn mower is smart not to oppose work and play, or
to link pleasure and privilege. You don't need a doctorate in
sociology to know that loads of disposable income are no guarantee of
good taste, creativity or happiness, much less moral virtue.</TE>
<TE>   "The Garden of Earthly Delights" is doubly funny because the brunt
of its social critique is leveled against art-world academics. It
mocks these lumpen-bureaucrats who behave as if art's job is to
reflect its surroundings or, better yet, illustrate their pet
theories about life in the big city. "Shut up and dance," the
whirling dervish of a lawn tool proclaims, "discourse divorced from
transformative activity is meaningless."</TE>
<TE>   That's a lesson the co-curators of the 15-artist exhibition appear
to be struggling to learn. Organized by Michael J. Dear, director of
USC's Southern California Studies Center, and Gustavo Leclerc,
director of the Border Cultures Project, "Mixed Feelings: Art and
Culture in the Postborder Metropolis" is a badly titled, poorly
conceived project that includes too much mediocre work among a
handful of standouts. The exhibition, which doesn't know if it wants
to be a carnival or a doctoral dissertation, settles for being a
generic term paper about a vague relationship between art and its
surroundings.</TE>
<TE>   The title treats art as if it were a greeting card--an object that
expresses its sender's sentiments. No serious contemporary artist
would tell you that personal feelings play an important role in his
work, whose public effect counts above all else. Feelings are for
amateurs, therapy sessions and out-of-touch academics.</TE>
<TE>   The easiest way for ivory-tower scholars to pretend to be onto
something new is to slap the prefix "post" on an old idea. In the
'80s, postmodernism was all the rage. More recently, it's been
suggested that we live in a post-black era. Postborder art is the
curators' attempt to keep the identity-oriented works that dominated
the mid-1990s from dying a natural death. Their angle: focus on
artists whose ethnicities are hyphenated.</TE>
<TE>   Visually, their show divides in two. The most thought-provoking
works are the most entertaining. These include Ortiz Torres'
over-the-top lawn mower, Laura Alvarez's playfully subversive video
featuring Sirvienta, a double agent disguised as a maid, and Einar
and Jamex de la Torre's hilarious installation, a life-size lunar
module in the shape of an ancient Olmec head.</TE>
<TE>   An astronaut with a giant plastic heart in his backpack stands by
the spacecraft, which is piloted by an angelic cherub seated backward
atop a fur-covered hobbyhorse. Discarded car tires represent the
moon's craters, in which gilded rattlesnakes lurk.</TE>
<TE>   These generous, multilayered works engage viewers from many walks
of life, promiscuously mixing metaphors (not feelings) as they stir
up the melting pot and draw us all into the action. Other works
aren't so successful.</TE>
<TE>   The humor in Daniel Joseph Martinez's animatronic doll wears thin
too quickly. Emitting recorded laughter as it goes through the
motions of throwing rocks, the artist's miniature self-portrait leave
too little room for imagination. Similarly, the small-scale film
festival presented by Rita Gonzalez and Jesse Lerner is only as
amusing as the two "zonkeys" that flank its two screens. It's more
fun--and provocative--to see these stuffed animals (that look like
the offspring of zebras and donkeys) in their natural habitat, in
front of Tijuana stores, where tourists from both sides of the border
pose for their own tongue-in-cheek portraits.</TE>
<TE>   The remaining works avoid laughter altogether. They range from the
unbelievably tedious to the blandly uninspired. Video installations
by Mariana Botey, Milena Muzquiz, Norman Yonemoto and Marcos Ramirez
Erre fall into the first category. Sculptural installations by Mark
Bradford, Barbara Jones, Joe Lewis and Amalia Mesa-Bains fall into
the latter.</TE>
<TE>   The majority of these artists have exhibited far more captivating
pieces in the past. But on those occasions, they generally made what
they wanted and presented the results. In contrast, all of the works
for "Mixed Feelings" were commissioned. Over the past two years, the
curators organized group meetings for all of the artists, at which
their motives, goals and strategies were discussed.</TE>
<TE>   Although these exclusive seminars may have generated lively
debates, the art they produced looks as if it has been designed to
appeal to academic committees. Textual interpretation takes
precedence over physical experience. For example, in the catalog,
Botey describes what she does as an artist as if she were a social
scientist applying for a government grant: "Ongoing research into the
phenomenology of subculture, resistance and ritual language has been
the focus of my interdisciplinary practice as a media artist."</TE>
<TE>   Artists are not scientists, rocket or otherwise. Putting knowledge
ahead of pleasure is a good idea if you're a teacher. But galleries
aren't classrooms. And art is far more effective when it's
pleasurable. Otherwise, it's forgettable. At its best, it gets you to
break out in song, to tap your toes because you feel its effect in
your bones. Only then does it give us something serious to think
about.</TE>

<LD>How are Americans coping one year after the terrorist attacks of
Sept. 11? That's the question public radio's "The Infinite Mind" will
tackle in a three-week series airing Sundays at 10 p.m. on KPCC-FM
(89.3), beginning this weekend.</LD>
<LD>   The first program deals specifically with the psychological trauma
induced by the attacks. The second examines the effect of the past
year's ethical crises in the church and corporate America. The third
focuses on how people's relationships to their jobs have changed
since last Sept. 11.</LD>

<HD>Sorkin Says 'West Wing' Door Is Open for Return of Lowe's
Character</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Take heart, Rob Lowe. Your character's life--if not his job--is safe.</LD>
<LD>   Lowe, who plays White House deputy communications director Sam
Seaborn in NBC's drama "The West Wing," has said he's leaving later
this season following a contract dispute.</LD>
<LD>   "Sam Seaborn is not going to die," series creator Aaron Sorkin
said Thursday. "So the door is always open."</LD>
<TE>   Lowe, 38, announced he was leaving after producers declined to
give him more money. The cast's biggest star when the series
premiered in 1999, he's since been eclipsed by Martin Sheen, who
plays President Josiah Bartlet, and is part of a large ensemble.</TE>
<TE>   Sorkin, as well as other cast members, have said they wished Lowe
didn't have to leave.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a difficult situation," Sorkin said. "There's no villain in
this case and it will be regrettable if it is portrayed that way.
It's a negotiation and it's a tough one."</TE>
<TE>   Sorkin said he has a plan for writing Seaborn out of the series
but wouldn't reveal it.</TE>

<HD>Outdoor Shakespeare Charms With a Lively Staging</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>F. Kathleen Foley, David C. Nichols, Daryl H. Miller</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When it comes to "A Midsummer Night's Dream," there's nothing like an
outdoor amphitheater. The Theatricum Botanicum, nestled snugly in
Topanga Canyon, is an ideal setting for Shakespeare's summertime
romp, seen here in a brisk and aerobic staging by director Ellen
Geer, who streamlines the proceedings to a family-friendly degree.</LD>
<LD>   We know we're in for a lively time when first we see Hippolyta
(Lexi Pearl), a sinewy, spear-bearing Amazon queen who makes Xena
look frilly in comparison. Bride-to-be of the noble Theseus (Chad
Jason), Hippolyta is a shrew worth taming, and her acrobatic tussles
with her groom are steamy stuff. Indeed, many in this appealing cast
appear to have considerable dance training. A sense of general
athleticism and breathless dispatch is maintained at all times.
Occasionally, Shakespeare's text is lost in busy-ness. And, rarely,
an actor slips into thrashing excess.</LD>
<LD>   But what are a few flaws amid the otherwise carefully controlled
mayhem? The cast is solid, and the (uncredited) costumes and makeup
design set the tone for whimsy.</LD>
<TE>   A physically imposing performer with a John Wayne twang, Thad Geer
plays Bottom as a perfectly unself-conscious fool. Elfin Melora
Marshall is a first-rate Puck, while Susan Angelo (sharing the role
with Abby Craden) makes for a gracious Titania.</TE>
<TE>   Among the lovers, Willow Geer stands out as Helena, the woebegone
Athenian maid who is unlucky in love--until Oberon (regal Steve Matt)
socks Demetrius (Mike Peebler) and Lysander (Jeff Wiesen) with a love
potion that has them chasing Helena like puppies playing fetch.</TE>
<TE>   And speaking of puppies, an adorable wiener dog in the Mechanicals
segment has the kids in the audience melting down from sheer
cuteness. So are the adults, although we'd never admit it.</TE>

<TE>   Hilarity and Sensitivity in 'The Crumple Zone'</TE>
<TE>   "My life is pure soap opera, and I'm not even a main character in
it!" This pronouncement typifies "The Crumple Zone," Buddy Thomas'
1998 populist dramedy receiving its Los Angeles premiere at the
Hudson Avenue Theatre.</TE>
<TE>   Set in Staten Island at Christmas, the plot turns on the
misanthropic Terry (Greg Wolfson), discovered at the outset bemoaning
network holiday treacle.</TE>
<TE>   Terry's real complaint is his unrequited yen for dreamboat Buck
(Joe Regelbrugge), exacerbated by Buck's clandestine affair with Alex
(Lane Janger), the significant other of Terry's roommate Matt (Matt
Huffman).</TE>
<TE>   Complicating this is Roger Ramone (Steve Mateo), whom drunken
Terry picks up on the ferry, with the unsuspecting Matt's unexpected
return from touring in "Salem's Lot: The Musical" leading to yuletide
chaos.</TE>
<TE>   Thomas' script is too small-scaled to qualify as groundbreaking,
but its refusal to qualify these characters is exemplary. The writing
turns gay self-reference into believable human discourse,
transcending genre through superior craftsmanship.</TE>
<TE>   Barring recurring sight-line discrepancies, Steven Benson's
detailed direction juggles hilarity and sensitivity to telling
effect. So do the designs, as in the autographed Susan Lucci poster
overlooking Donna Glennon's holiday decor.</TE>
<TE>   The ensemble is most winning. Wolfson devours the stage, his
ferocious delivery archly dovetailing with Terry's neuroses.
Huffman's internalized cuckold superbly embodies the opposite polar
dynamic.</TE>
<TE>   Stage debutante Janger's occasional hesitancy suits his conflicted
adulterer, and both Regelbrugge and Mateo are thoroughly
accomplished. As is "The Crumple Zone," which, though specialized, is
so engrossing that the distinction seems irrelevant.</TE>

<TE>   Connections Far From Home in 'The Emissary'</TE>
<TE>   We live in an age of willing dislocation, as people leave home to
seek new lives elsewhere. Many of these wanderers end up in catch-all
cities like Los Angeles, where every apartment building seems to be a
mini-United Nations of ethnicities and religions.</TE>
<TE>   The change of scene can be mind-expanding, but it can also leave
people feeling isolated and lost.</TE>
<TE>   Harry Karp touches on these ideas in his play "The Emissary,"
about a young Lubavitcher Jew who flees a tightknit community in New
York for a more open existence in Los Angeles. It's an intriguing
setup, rife with issues that could easily transcend the specific to
the universal.</TE>
<TE>   But the story is clumsily built of artificial characters, cheesy
dialogue and cultural stereotypes--all of which come off still worse
in a slack, hesitant staging by director Frank Megna at Working Stage
Theater.</TE>
<TE>   Fortunately, Josh Covitt brings earnestness and warmth to the
character of David, who, in 1994, abandons New York after the deaths
of his mother and Rabbi Menachem M. Schneerson, the Lubavitchers'
spiritual leader. David seems to be rebelling against his upbringing,
but upon arriving in Los Angeles, he sticks close to his roots by
finding work as the kosher supervisor for a restaurant run by the
aging Edith (Sue Ozeran).</TE>
<TE>   The play briefly sparks to life as a Latina restaurant employee,
the quietly luminous Sonya (Nancy Sanchez), teases smiles out of
Covitt, and a halting attraction develops between them. But soon, a
calculating blond beauty (Alisha D. Moore) is competing for David's
affections, uttering B-movie lines--"When I see something I want, I
go for it"--in a condescending purr.</TE>
<TE>   Still-worse stereotypes are perpetuated via a bug-eyed,
gesticulating Lubavitcher and an indolent Latino cook (who actually
drawls, "Not my job"), both played by Charles Anteby.</TE>
<TE>   In a world yearning for connection, "The Emissary" ends up driving
people further apart.</TE>

<DH>L.A. Opera keeps delivering surprises as it opens its
season with a Hollywood western take on Puccini's 'Girl of the Golden
West'</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>For all the supposed topsy-turvy backstage at Los Angeles Opera, on
stage it could be accused of being consistent to a fault just now.
Wednesday night, the company's 17th season picked up pretty much
where the previous one had left off. In June, the Dorothy Chandler
Pavilion was home to Puccini's last two operas, "Gianni Schicchi" and
"Turandot." The new season opened with yet another late Puccini work,
"The Girl of the Golden West," produced by the "Turandot" team.</LD>
<LD>   There were differences, however. Gian-Carlo del Monaco wasn't on
hand to stage his production, which comes to Los Angeles from Nice.
The director, no longer welcome after his reported temper tantrums
here in the spring, was replaced primarily by his assistant, Elena
Kalabakos. Designer Michael Scott angered "Turandot" audiences with a
handsome lacquered set not fully visible from many seats. But for
Puccini's horse opera, Scott has done a spectacular job of
re-creating the Gold Rush country. His intricately detailed sets of
saloon, mountain cabin and mining town, which pay homage to classic
Hollywood westerns, prompted delighted applause. A couple of
beautiful horses and gorgeous snow didn't hurt, either.</LD>
<TE>   There are other differences, as well. While "Schicchi" and
"Turandot" are Puccini at his most dramatically sophisticated, "Girl
of the Golden West" ("La Fanciulla del West," in its original title)
represents, at least for a Californian, exoticism gone risibly awry.
Grizzled miners long for mama. Minnie (part Mimi, part Annie Oakley),
never before kissed but quick on the draw, redeems the bandit, Dick
Johnson, through her love, as she rejects the advances of Sheriff
Jack Rance. Puccini pours on the thick pathos. Although there are
moments of Debussyan harmonies and experimental orchestrations that
can take a listener aback, they make for a pretty Sierra musical
atmosphere. Who doesn't cringe when the ragazzi start up with their
Italianate "Dooda, dooda, dooda day"?</TE>
<TE>   So leave it to the ever unpredictable L.A. Opera to actually pull
this original spaghetti western off. Leave it, in particular, to
Placido Domingo.</TE>
<TE>   Domingo has long shown a fondness for the role of Dick Johnson.
He's recorded it twice, sung it countless times, including in the
previous L.A. Opera production of the opera in 1991. Domingo was also
the star when the Metropolitan Opera mounted what was essentially the
same Del Monaco production 10 years ago. And the opera does suit
Domingo particularly well. As suave bandit and lover, Johnson is a
man who lives off his charm, and Domingo saunters around the stage as
if he owns it (which he does, in a sense, as the company's artistic
director). With each passing year, his enduring vocal freshness comes
to seem a phenomenon of nature. But even by Domingo's standards, he
can still produce an arresting bloom.</TE>
<TE>   The sets are canny, full of enclosed wooden structures that
effectively reflect the voice, and he managed to find just the right
place when he needed a bit of extra support. And while Domingo is
hardly as flexible a singer as he once was, he has the ability to
compensate with perfectly prepared outbursts, to make acting and
singing part of the same inner ardor. Wednesday night, he was, on all
levels, a master at work.</TE>
<TE>   And that includes as impresario. With the boss on stage, the
company comes to life. Catherine Malfitano's Minnie will not be to
all tastes. At times she could seem a coltish Joan Crawford. She is
no longer strong in the lower ranges and variably steady in the
upper. But she commands the big moments vocally and theatrically, as
she chews the scenery. She also makes a good foil to Wolfgang
Brendel's dangerously elegant Jack Rance.</TE>
<TE>   "Girl of the Golden West" has never been one of Puccini's most
popular operas, and in part that is because the opera requires a
particularly good ensemble cast (not, as a program essay would have
us believe, because audiences are still influenced by the critical
response of its premiere in 1910). There are 15 small roles--miners
and Native Americans--and it's a nearly impossible task not to make
them all seem faintly ridiculous. The production does a superb job of
creating harsh realism, with the solo singers and chorus aided and
abetted by stuntmen producing a rollicking barroom brawl. Strongly
realized were the love-sick Sonora (Jack Wells), the Wells Fargo
agent Ashby (Louis Lebherz), nostalgic balladeer Jake Wallace (James
Creswell), homesick Larkens (Ron Li-Paz) and the squaw Wowkle
(Suzanna Guzman).</TE>
<TE>   A further attribute, and one of the most important, was the
company debut of a conducting girl of the West, the energetic
Australian conductor Simone Young. Her basic impulse was to create
excitement. She did not hesitate to push the ensemble to its limits;
she was not afraid to run roughshod over Puccini when that meant
moving along the action (this is a western, after all, and the first
act drags). She was not afraid to let lyricism blossom and not afraid
to cut it off before it turned maudlin.</TE>
<TE>   "Girl of the Golden West" is a dumb opera, and I think everyone in
the Pavilion knew it Wednesday. To L.A. Opera's credit, most of us
didn't care.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   "The Girl of the Golden West" repeats Saturday, Tuesday and Sept.
13, 16 and 19 at 7:30 p.m. and Sept 22 at 2 p.m. (with Luis Lima
replacing Placido Domingo for the last two performances), $30-$170,

<DL></DL>
<LD>"Elling," an Oscar nominee from Norway for best foreign language
film, is sentimental in the best sense, in that it celebrates life's
possibilities with equal parts sweetness and humor.</LD>
<LD>   A witty and sophisticated sensibility brings individuality to the
classic odd-couple comedy. Adapted for the screen by Axel Hellstenius
from the Ingvar Ambjornsen novel and directed by Petter Naess,
"Elling" further benefits from its subtlety and telling nuances.</LD>
<LD>   Told from the point of view of the title character, who also
supplies occasional off-screen narration, the film stars Per
Christian Ellefsen as Elling, a small, fussy, middle-aged man sent to
a state mental institution when he is found holed up in a filthy
apartment he had shared his entire life with his widowed mother until
her recent death.</LD>
<TE>   It's entirely possible that Elling left his mother's side only to
attend school, and her passing has left him unable to care for
himself. Friendless all his life, Elling has developed agoraphobia so
acute that to step outside his home is to induce dizziness and
anxiety attacks.</TE>
<TE>   At the institution, he is placed in a room with Kjell Bjarne (Sven
Nordin), a big, beefy red-haired young man. All we know about him is
that he had spent his youth on a pig farm run by a hated stepfather,
which has left him capable of rages so intense that he bangs his head
on walls, and that he attended special education classes because he
was regarded as retarded. Elling also has a short fuse and is given
to shrill temper tantrums.</TE>
<TE>   Naess and Hellstenius first adapted "Elling" as a play, with great
success. Naess has said he did not want to make a film about
psychiatry, but about individuals who have no social experience and
never had anyone place faith in them.</TE>
<TE>   For all their differences, the two men possess a basic decency and
kindness, and their previous experiences begin to bring them
together. They are grown men who are virtual preschoolers in terms of
skills necessary to get along with others.</TE>
<TE>   Eventually the two are ready to leave the security of the
institution and share a subsidized apartment in the center of Oslo
under the supervision of a social worker, who makes it clear that
holding onto their new quarters depends on their ability to take care
of themselves. They must cook and clean and shop, making intelligent
use of a government-provided allowance.</TE>
<TE>   Initially terror-struck at leaving the apartment, Elling is
surprised to discover while crossing a street with Kjell Bjarne a
feeling of safety and security from "one of life's simpler apostles."</TE>
<TE>   The two have thus embarked on their great adventure in the real
world, and what it holds in store for them proves to be a source of
much humor and considerable poignancy. "Elling" suggests also how
fortunate these two are as members of a society so enlightened about
the treatment of the mentally ill and emotionally disturbed.</TE>
<TE>   With terrific star turns from Ellefsen and Nordin, who created
their roles in the stage version, "Elling" is a graceful, heartfelt
treat.</TE>
<TE>   MPAA rating: R, for language and some sexual content. Times
guidelines: The language and humor are earthy but in the context of
the film suitable for mature teens.</TE>

<LD>What's a junior science whiz with a robot dog, a space rocket and
gravity-defying hair to do after he's saved the Earth from aliens? Go
to school, do homework, be in bed by 9 ... invent a time machine, mix
up a youth serum, turn a teacher into a 50-foot monster....</LD>
<LD>   In "The Adventures of Jimmy Neutron, Boy Genius," launching at
8:30 tonight on Nickelodeon, the pint-sized hero from last year's
Oscar-nominated, 3D-animated film applies his industrial-strength
brain power--and his wacky inventions--to problem-solving in small
town Retroville.</LD>
<LD>   Tonight, Jimmy decides he'd rather be a "normal boy" and dumbs
himself down to fit in, until he and his pals find that smart is
better, especially when a plan is needed to keep Retroville from
being flattened by a giant meteor.</LD>
<TE>   In the second half of the show, Jimmy tries to best annoying rival
Cindy in the school's fund-raising candy drive with a door-to-door
salesman robot that turns out to have a mind of its own.</TE>
<TE>   In the next week's episodes (there are two per show) things go
typically awry when Jimmy builds a little brother robot who turns out
to be more popular than he is, and when he brings Thomas Edison to
class to prove a point--and Edison falls for his teacher, Miss Fowl.</TE>
<TE>   (Each Friday show repeats on Saturday and Sunday at 10:30 a.m.)</TE>
<TE>   The spot-on voice cast includes Debi Derryberry as Jimmy, Rob
Paulsen as Jimmy's wonderfully nerdy pal, Carl, and Andrea Martin as
the strange but sweet Miss Fowl.</TE>
<TE>   The show's vividly crafted computer animation is as impressive as
it was on the big screen, and Jimmy and his lavishly detailed world,
created by John A. Davis, are a quirky treat for family viewing.</TE>

<HD>'City by the Sea' Is in Something of a Fog</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KENNETH TURAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"City by the Sea" is the cinematic equivalent of defensive driving:
It's careful, conscientious and makes no major mistakes. But what
saves lives on the freeway does not necessarily make for persuasive
viewing.</LD>
<LD>   This story of troubled souls in a ruined city--with a
sins-of-the-fathers theme thrown in free of charge--has something of
the feel of earnest postwar studio films like Nicholas Ray's 1949
"Knock on Any Door." Director Michael Caton-Jones is a reliable
craftsman, and "City by the Sea" contains any number of good things.
What it doesn't offer is a compelling reason to see it.</LD>
<LD>   In fact, those sequences in which the film rouses itself and
delivers sparkling moments--for instance when Robert De Niro and
Patti LuPone go at each other as a hostile divorced couple--just
serve to remind us of the involvement we've been missing the rest of
the time.</LD>
<TE>   Because it is solid, "City by the Sea's" key difficulty turns out
to be hidden in plain sight. For even though De Niro can be peerless,
and even though he's played enough cops to qualify for a pension, the
convergence of this particular actor and this particular role turns
out to be less than desirable.</TE>
<TE>   As much a major player as any of the performers is the city of the
film's title. That would be Long Beach, N.Y., a derelict resort town
on Long Island's southern shore that, one character says, "looks like
the Serbian Army came through." It's so the kind of place Bruce
Springsteen would love that it's no surprise to find that the film
was actually shot in the Boss' Asbury Park, N.J., hometown.</TE>
<TE>   Speaking of Springsteen, we first see Joey Nova ("James Dean's"
charismatic James Franco), so called because of the car he loves,
wandering through desolate streets clutching a guitar that he's
trying to sell for enough money for a fix.</TE>
<TE>   Though a major user, Joey is a junkie of the sensitive poet type,
a basically good kid who's made a number of bad choices, including
abandoning a son he fathered with ex-girlfriend Gina (Eliza Dushku).
The film has barely started before he makes another mistake, and
suddenly, almost unintentionally, a drug dealer named Picasso is
dead.</TE>
<TE>   Picasso's demise may be bad for Joey, but it is good for the film
in that it introduces William Forsythe as Spyder, the town's drug
kingpin, and a man who takes the loss of his dealers seriously. An
underappreciated character actor who's been in everything from "Once
Upon a Time in America" to "The Waterdance" and who specializes in
delivering menace with authority, Forsythe's convincing performance
keeps "City by the Sea" alive. When he screams "You're dead" at
someone, they believe it, and so do we.</TE>
<TE>   As Joey's story unfolds, so does that of the father he hasn't seen
in 14 years, ever since Vincent LaMarca (De Niro) walked out on his
son after a particularly acrimonious divorce. Now a top Manhattan
homicide detective, LaMarca leads what might be called an
arm's-length life.</TE>
<TE>   LaMarca's girlfriend, Michelle (Frances McDormand), lives a floor
below him, and the detective likes it that way. His married partner,
Reg (George Dzunda), keeps inviting him over to bask in the joys of
family life, but the detective says that too much love makes him feel
uncomfortable.</TE>
<TE>   LaMarca's comfort level is shattered for good when, wouldn't you
know it, he and Reg are the guys on duty when Picasso's body
picturesquely washes up just past the Brooklyn Bridge. Just like
that, the detective is investigating a homicide where his own son
looks to be suspect No. 1.</TE>
<TE>   As written by Ken Hixon, "City by the Sea's" story is one of an
emotionally unavailable man forced by circumstances to reconnect with
life. Having a bottled-up main character can be a risk for a film,
and the way De Niro plays LaMarca adds to the difficulty.</TE>
<TE>   Looking here like a vaguely menacing teddy bear, De Niro is not an
actor you want to encourage to go into a shell. His phlegmatism here
makes it seem like he's walking through his part even if he's not,
and he gives co-star McDormand so little to play against that this
excellent actress doesn't make the impression she should.</TE>
<TE>   Though it's based on a true story (specifically a 1997 Esquire
article written by Mike McAlary) "City by the Sea" has trouble
seeming real. Its back story, involving the sins of Detective
LaMarca's own father, feels contrived and the eventual resolution is
simultaneously shaky and too pat. De Niro may be an elder statesman
of American acting, but having him play like one is not to be
encouraged.</TE>
<TE>   MPAA rating: R, for language, drug use and some violence. Times
guidelines: The language is stronger than the violence.</TE>

<LD>It's an especially busy day on the Burbank set of "Days of Our
Lives." The cavernous place is crowded with visitors, and all
attention is focused on an area dressed with potted trees and shrubs
strung with tiny white lights to look like a city park on the evening
of a charity fund-raiser. Red and white balloons are so plentiful
that actor Josh Taylor struggles to get them out of his way to take
his position for the next scene. John Aniston, Jennifer Aniston's
father and one of the show's leading men, wipes his brow and waits
for his cue. Actress Nadia Bjorlin interviews with the "Soap Center"
TV crew, while the production manager tries to herd dozens of extras
into their positions.</LD>
<LD>   "I need you to come back on the set," he tells the drifting crowd.
"We're going to need to take positions so we can continue."</LD>
<LD>   Few people acknowledge him.</LD>
<TE>   On a day in late August, the cast and crew are portraying the
Leukemia &amp; Lymphoma Society's annual "Light the Night" walk, an event
that takes place in real life this month in several U.S. cities to
raise money and awareness for the diseases.</TE>
<TE>   "Days" producers deliberately incorporated the walk into the
show's September story line to help publicize the charity. To make
the story believable, writers gave leukemia to Bjorlin's
character--the beautiful orphaned opera star Chloe Lane--not knowing
that Bjorlin's real-life father, Swedish composer Ulf Bjorlin, died
of leukemia six years ago.</TE>
<TE>   The 21-year-old actress initially hesitated at the idea. "At first
it was scary," she said during a break. "It's something that's so
close to home and it still hurts."</TE>
<TE>   Ultimately, Bjorlin went along with the story and portrayed the
same symptoms that she watched her father experience: bruising,
fatigue, fainting and then the side effects of chemotherapy.</TE>
<TE>   "It was tough for all of us," she said.</TE>
<TE>   She said the role was difficult but it helped bring her family
closer and provided a new understanding of her father's illness.</TE>
<TE>   The society's members are certainly appreciative of her efforts.
During a break in the filming, the group's L.A. chapter senior
executive director, Jane Warner, promised the cast: "We're converting
people to 'Days of Our Lives' watchers all over L.A.!"</TE>
<TE>   Anniversary Bash</TE>
<TE>   Vincent Longo just celebrated his fifth year of applying color to
famous faces, and for the anniversary, the New York-based celebrity
makeup artist decided to fly a few friends to Cannes for a weekend of
pampering and a little shindig.</TE>
<TE>   (Longo has clients who really don't need the help, such as Gwyneth
Paltrow, Winona Ryder and Sarah Jessica Parker.)</TE>
<TE>   After a weekend of frolicking with the French, Longo hosted a
grand fete Tuesday at the House of Bagatelle, which, with its four
outdoor and three indoor pools, Turkish baths, saunas and views of
Cannes and the Mediterranean Sea from every room, was anything but a
trifle.</TE>
<TE>   The invitation list had all the ingredients a party on the French
Riviera needs:</TE>
<TE>   One Bush model: Lauren, with mom, Sharon.</TE>
<TE>   One pop singer: Ricky Martin;.</TE>
<TE>   One table-dancing hotel heiress: Nicky Hilton;.</TE>
<TE>   One activist and singer: Bono;.</TE>
<TE>   One French hunk: Gerard Depardieu (who emceed in French and
English).</TE>
<TE>   One French diva: Catherine Deneuve.</TE>
<TE>   And three supermodels: Naomi Campbell, Claudia Schiffer and Heidi
Klum.</TE>
<TE>   "Celebrities, they're all my friends," said Longo, reached on his
cell phone in Nice. "I know all the models and all the actresses." He
was a little hoarse after "two days of going at it."</TE>
<TE>   "It was very cazh," he said of Tuesday's party, meaning casual,
"but also elegant. Very chill.</TE>
<TE>   "Even though it was Europeans, French and Americans coming
together, somehow we all connected. It was beautiful," said Longo, an
Australian. (In the transnational spirit, Martin and Patti LaBelle
sang a little French ditty.)</TE>
<TE>   Even for someone who had taken the Bushes, mere et fille, to
Venice just a couple of days before, the party was a little
overwhelming. "I just kept pinching myself," Longo said.</TE>
<TE>   Quote/unquote:</TE>
<TE>   "It was a very 'Me-me-me' universe. Not thinking before I spoke,
before I acted ... I was going through life robotically, even though
I thought I was a ... rebel, outside-of-it-all person. I was still a
sheep in many ways ... My life was very small picture."--Madonna on
life before husband Guy and motherhood in Vanity Fair's October
issue.</TE>

<LD>ONE MAN'S BIBLE</LD>
<LD>   A Novel</LD>
<LD>   By Gao Xingjian</LD>
<TE>   Translated from the Chinese</TE>
<TE>   by Mabel Lee</TE>
<TE>   HarperCollins</TE>
<TE>   450 pages, $26.95</TE>
<TE>   Four nights in a Hong Kong hotel nearly puts him away. Yes, there
are hours of lovemaking with a sensual stranger he meets at a
writers' conference, but then, there are her taunting refusals and
her taste for sadistic sex.</TE>
<TE>   Worse, for the unnamed narrator of Gao Xingjian's tormented novel
"One Man's Bible," his German temptress casts a wicked spell on him.
Margarethe, a language translator fluent in Chinese, tells him that
he should write his own story. He is, after all, a playwright, and he
was raised in China during the Cultural Revolution. This is his true
identity.</TE>
<TE>   But he refuses. He's spent decades learning to live in the present
as his way of blocking out the past. Sex is his anesthesia.
Margarethe goes home to Germany and won't return his phone calls, but
he can't forget her, and finally, against his will, he writes his
memoir, cursing her name.</TE>
<TE>   These disturbing first steps lead to a steep climb of a book, with
switchbacks to the Red Terror and the reign of Mao Tse-tung, pauses
in the Hong Kong of 1997--a few months before the island loses its
British status--and then back to life as it was in China, under
Communist rule.</TE>
<TE>   The narrator, referred to as "he" in the flashbacks and "you" in
the Hong Kong scenes, is an exile in Paris who still writes in
Chinese. It is tempting to replace the personal pronoun with the
author's name for the obvious reasons. Gao, who is also a playwright,
left China in 1987 and settled in France. In 2000 he became the first
Chinese writer to win the Nobel Prize for literature. At the time he
was virtually unknown among Western readers, but when HarperCollins
published the English translation of his 1990 novel, "Soul Mountain,"
later that year, Gao's reputation spread.</TE>
<TE>   In "One Man's Bible," the narrator recounts his early years in
Beijing, where artists and intellectuals were redeployed as street
sweepers and factories were infested with informants. He worked in a
book-making factory that publishes party literature and Mao's
"Sayings," and he tried, unsuccessfully, to cover up his interests in
Greek classics and Italian films. Nor did it help his reputation that
his father, once a bank clerk, was being investigated by the Red
Guard.</TE>
<TE>   For his halfhearted commitment to the new regime, the narrator is
sent to a re-education camp in the provinces. From there he writes to
a girl he knew in school and invites her to marry him. She answers by
traveling four days by bus to see him. Without ever saying whether
she will accept his proposal, she allows him to arrange their
wedding. Days after they sign the legal papers, she discovers his
personal writings, hidden in a drawer.</TE>
<TE>   "You're a counterrevolutionary, a stinking counterrevolutionary!"
she shrieks.... "You've killed me. I've been killed by you."</TE>
<TE>   She leaves him, and he waits, certain that she will inform the
police. The betrayal cost him his last grains of confidence.</TE>
<TE>   All these years later, he doubts that he ever loved anyone. But it
is not only faith in love that was stripped away in China. He grew
accustomed to squelching his own thoughts. He watched old men tremble
at the mention of their impulsive past. If they once owned a gun, the
Red Guard might accuse them of plotting revolution. If they ever
worked at a bank, they could be beaten to death as capitalist
deviants.</TE>
<TE>   Gao's portraits of dread are among the book's most compelling
scenes. By them he measures the cost of a terrorist regime in terms
of human souls. The narrator begins his own slow death as a young man
working in the factory, wearing down a path from one affair to the
next. Young women, some of them bundled in padded military coats,
some rosy cheeked from the howling winters and the long bicycle rides
that lead to his door, come to him, offer themselves and leave.
Bursting with life and desire, straining against the puritanical
rules, they hardly speak, except to call him "comrade" or "brother."</TE>
<TE>   Despairing men and women are like dabs of color that begin to
connect and finally to form a vast impressionistic novel. Their
quick, incisive portraits balance on the sensual atmospherics of
China's hard rains and dewy mists. In time, they begin to shimmer
and, oddly enough, to imply hope, as if Gao wants us to consider
these lives and desires as more enduring than the terrors of the
regime.</TE>
<TE>   In "One Man's Bible," Gao continues the odyssey that he began in
"Soul Mountain." What was a journey through the heart of rural China,
in this latest work is a broader and more critical meditation on the
ravages of the past and a cautionary note for the future.</TE>

<HD>Too Hot for Fur, Too Hip for Skirts</HD>
<DH>Forget trends elsewhere--change of season can't change the
L.A. look</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BOOTH MOORE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In L.A., where the mercury can top out over 80 degrees well into
October, the sartorial signs of fall are so subtle that all but the
most trained fashion eyes could easily miss them: a cashmere shell,
instead of a camisole, worn over a pair of hip-slung Earl jeans for a
breezy night on the roof of the downtown Standard; a pashmina thrown
casually over a wisp of a dress for an evening premiere at Grauman's
Chinese Theatre; boots slowly displacing Dr. Scholl's as the footwear
of choice for daytime errands on Montana Avenue.</LD>
<LD>   Magazines may inundate us with images of fuzzy fur bomber jackets
and boucle pencil skirts, but some pieces would look as out of place
here as a snowplow on the 405. Take the fur cape as long as a Lincoln
shown at Fendi, Louis Vuitton's folkloric rabbit fur-trimmed
miniskirt, or any fur coat, for that matter. "They would look
ridiculous," says boutique owner Tracey Ross, who caters to young
Hollywood.</LD>
<LD>   And you're not likely to find a pencil-skirted lady lunching at
Les Deux Cafes either. "Pencil skirts are New York career girl. We
don't wear skirts here," adds Ross, who has snapped up jackets at
Yves Saint Laurent Rive Gauche and chunky knit sweaters from
L.A.-based designer Rick Owens for her own fall wardrobe.</LD>
<TE>   Gaucho pants and knickers had their moment on the runways at
Giorgio Armani, Max Mara and Burberry, but they won't be strolling
down Rodeo Drive anytime soon. "Women here are used to wearing what's
slimming. Wide-legged or short pants are not going to fly. Here,
people would rather look like they are in great shape and they have a
great body than look fashionable. In New York, they would rather have
what's cool and hip at the moment than look like they work out," says
Kelly Biren, West Coast editor of Allure magazine.</TE>
<TE>   Here, fall dressing isn't as much about trends as it is about
accent pieces. "Our seasons may not be as extreme as in New York or
Europe ... but we're certainly not going to wear our flip-flops and
sundresses into the winter," says actress China Chow, 28, whose most
recent purchase was a Rick Owens leather jacket she plans to wear
with "everything."</TE>
<TE>   Even when the sun is still strong enough to make a steering wheel
sizzling to the touch, fall fabrics are tolerable in small doses. On
a recent afternoon at her Sunset Plaza store, Ross made a brown wool
houndstooth miniskirt from Fake London work by teaming it with a
beige tank top, bare legs and brown suede Pumas. L.A. fashion
designer Jennifer Nicholson likes to balance her own pinwale corduroy
tux pants with a lightweight blouse, adding flannel or tweed hats by
Eugenia Kim for the perfect fall touch.</TE>
<TE>   Scarves can work, too. Not wild and woolly mufflers, but thin
scarves such as Marc Jacobs' silvery, sequined version. But forget
stockings and tights. Boots are worn on bare legs, and the higher the
heel the better--it's not like we have to worry about walking farther
than the distance from the car valet to the front door.</TE>
<TE>   L.A. women love coats, which are worn here for fashion rather than
for function. Ross likes Chloe's lightweight wrap-style black satin
trench and London designer Matthew Williamson's pink paisley velvet
coat, both worn over jeans and a tank top.</TE>
<TE>   "In L.A., coats are the ultimate accessories," says Jeannine
Braden, owner of Santa Monica's Fred Segal Flair and a partner in the
fashion Web site Purpleskirt.com. Braden has already sold out of two
shipments of Marc Jacobs' $358 twill jackets with faux fur hoods.</TE>
<TE>   "You can get away with wearing a sweater or a jacket if it's over
something light," says Amanda Goldberg, 28. The associate producer of
2000's "Charlie's Angels" and the upcoming sequel has already nabbed
a winter white cashmere coat and a black velvet tuxedo jacket from
YSL for fall, as well as a couple of new eye shadows from Stila in
plum tones. "Since our clothes don't change much, it's fun to change
up your makeup or hair color," she says.</TE>
<TE>   But in a town where the surf's up year-round, how does a girl know
when to make the seasonal switch, on what precise day to retire the
terry cloth Juicy Couture suit for the cashmere one, the flip-flops
for the Pumas, the summer jeans for the fall ones?</TE>
<TE>   Some women create their own change-of-season rituals. During
mid-August, Nicholson (daughter of Jack) takes most of her
lightweight summer clothes to Paper Bag Princess, a West Hollywood
resale shop. "Unless it's really classic, like a piece by Chanel, I
move on because there will always be better stuff next year," says
Nicholson, 38, who owns Pearl, a boutique in Santa Monica. (The items
she keeps are moved into a cedar-lined closet she had specially built
in her garage.)</TE>
<TE>   TV and film producer Keri Selig, 34, takes her cues from stores.
Nothing puts her in the mood for fall like a trip to junior fashion
emporium Forever 21, where she recently picked up a pair of $29
round-toed pumps that look like this season's Prada. "The great thing
is that at this price they are disposable," she says.</TE>
<TE>   But for all the fashion hubbub, there are those in L.A. for whom
dressing is truly seasonless. "I have a 365-day, constant outfit,"
says Rebecca Bloom, 27, a jewelry designer and the author of "Girl
Anatomy" (HarperCollins, 2002), a coming-of-age tale set in L.A. When
she's at home writing, the outfit is Juicy sweats; when she goes out,
it's jeans, a tank top and a light coat from Marni or Marc Jacobs.</TE>
<TE>   East Coast transplant Tatiana von Furstenberg, 31, is in the same
camp. For her, the best thing about living and dressing in L.A. is
the absence of any kind of style schedule. "You can just wear
something until you don't want to wear it anymore, then get something
new. There's not that frenetic energy around fall shopping like there
is in New York," says Furstenberg, who sold her Los Feliz boutique
Steinberg &amp; Sons in December and is now singing in the band Playdate.</TE>
<TE>   "Fashion changes relatively little here," says Allure's Biren.
"Overall, it's just girls with skinny bods and great jeans."</TE>

<LD>They're everywhere! Are they birds? Are they planes? Are they stamps?
Well, yes and no. They're not birds or planes, but they are on
postage stamps issued in April that say "Greetings From California."
What are they?</LD>
<LD>   They're palm trees! And there are about 2,800 varieties of them.
Some have spines on their trunks, and others are ringed or covered
with fibers. They can grow up to 150 feet tall, and their leaves look
like feathers, fans, fishtails or even wheel spokes.</LD>
<LD>   Palm trees come from all over the world. The California fan palm
is the only palm native to California. Other types include the king
and queen palms, spiny fiber palm, jelly palm, solitary fishtail
palm, Chilean wine palm, lady palm and windmill palm. Can you imagine
what they might look like or how they are used from their names?</LD>
<TE>   Coconut palms grow in the tropics, like Hawaii, where it is wet
and warm. Coconuts have many uses. Their thick exterior coating is
ground up and pressed into charcoal. Their shells can be made into
spoons, knives, bowls, cups and art objects. Inside is a liquid that
can be drunk and a white fruit that can be eaten.</TE>
<TE>   Date palms grow in hot and dry regions, like the Coachella Valley
in the desert near Palm Springs, where their roots can be close to
water. Dates can be eaten or made into sugar.</TE>
<TE>   The trunks of most palms can be used for building materials. Their
leaves can be woven into baskets and mats and used to construct roofs
and sides of dwellings. Palm oil, which is made from hard nuts, can
be used for soap, cosmetics and cooking oil.</TE>
<TE>   You can see some of the palm trees mentioned above and
approximately 5,000 other species of plants at the Mildred E. Mathias
Botanical Garden. To learn more about the garden, visit
www.botgard.ucla.edu or call (310) 825-1260.</TE>

yourself. Here are two of them.</LD>
<LD>   America, America</LD>
<LD>   Look at the American flag gleaming,</LD>
<TE>   And the city lights beaming.</TE>
<TE>   America stands for so much,</TE>
<TE>   Diversity is the way we go,</TE>
<TE>   And we refuse to say no.</TE>
<TE>   Success is our key,</TE>
<TE>   But that is not important to me.</TE>
<TE>   We are united,</TE>
<TE>   Even when our hearts were torn,</TE>
<TE>   Although, there is no more,</TE>
<TE>   We are still united.</TE>
<TE>   Even though around the world,</TE>
<TE>   There is fighting.</TE>
<TE>   We stand up all mighty!</TE>
<TE>   Our flag is what we are and stand for,</TE>
<TE>   And we have a right to brag.</TE>
<TE>   So stand up and be proud,</TE>
<TE>   Shout loud,</TE>
<TE>   And say, "I'm an American!"</TE>

<TE>   No matter where you are,</TE>

<HD>Shirt-Sleeve Dilemma Leaves Him Dangling</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jeannine Stein</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Dear Fashion Police: I like wearing western shirts, but I've found
that the sleeves come in only one length, which is many inches longer
than normal--so much so that the cuffs extend over my fingers. I can
pull the cuffs up to the right place, but then the sleeves bunch up.
Decorations such as embroidery or snaps on the cuffs make alterations
difficult and expensive, and I've had poor results when I have had
shirts altered. Can you help? I usually wear a 15 1/2-inch collar and
a 32-inch sleeve.</LD>
<LD>   --DANG IT ALL</LD>
<LD>   Dear Dang: We had not heard of this overly long sleeve phenomenon
on western shirts, so we contacted a couple of experts in the field.
George Uresti, director of e-commerce at Cavender's, a Texas-based
chain of western-wear stores (www.cavenders.com), said that there is
no standard sleeve length that manufacturers use when making their
shirts. Many shirts often come in small, medium, large and
extra-large and not with specific collar and sleeve sizes, as with
dress shirts.</LD>
<TE>   A medium shirt with a 15-inch collar could have a sleeve length of
33/34, which would be overly long for you.</TE>
<TE>   Marie Duck, manager of Spencers Western World in Pinellas Park,
Florida (www.spencers westernworld.com), added that sleeves on
western shirts are sometimes cut a bit longer to appear fuller when
buttoned or snapped at the wrist.</TE>
<TE>   Both Uresti and Duck suggested that if you're ordering shirts in a
store or online, ask a salesperson or a customer service
representative for more precise sleeve and collar measurements--they
should be able to provide that information.</TE>
<TE>   You still may have to resort to a tailor, even though you've not
been happy with results in the past. The extra expense of finding an
expert tailor who knows what he or she is doing may be worth it if
you wear these shirts a lot.</TE>
<TE>   Dear Fashion Police: Years ago I inherited a mink jacket that I
never have worn, nor will I ever wear it. I feel very strongly that
fur looks best on the animal, and I do support People for the Ethical
Treatment of Animals. But since I inherited the fur, I don't feel
right just discarding it. I saw an ad in a magazine once for a
recycled mink teddy bear, and I was considering doing that. I can't
bring back the minks, but I would get some enjoyment out of the bear.
I'd be grateful if you could suggest a furrier that could help make
this into a bear.</TE>
<TE>   --THE FUR ISN'T FLYING</TE>
<TE>   Dear Fur:  Though we agree that the damage has been done with
regard to the animals, there's something about turning the coat into
a teddy bear that makes us feel kind of ... icky. Maybe it's the
thought of having a cute, smiling bear around as a reminder of the
minks' fate that doesn't sit well with us.</TE>
<TE>   Since you're a supporter of PETA, we thought we'd ask the group
for suggestions. Andrew Butler, a campaign coordinator, said that for
four years the organization has donated unwanted fur coats to
homeless shelters in cold-climate cities such as Chicago, New York
and Washington. For six months, some coats have also been shipped to
people in Afghanistan via humanitarian aid agencies.</TE>
<TE>   "When people are in desperate need, this is a good solution. It's
a win-win for everyone," Butler said. Fur coat donations to PETA are
tax deductible, but they must be appraised by an independent source;
the group will not appraise the fur.</TE>
<TE>   You can send your coat to PETA's headquarters at 501 Front St.,
Norfolk, VA 23510. If the shipping costs are prohibitive, you can
also contact a local shelter to see if it will accept a fur coat
donation.</TE>

<LD>Mrs. Otis eases the baby back into her stroller.</LD>
<LD>   I breathe again. Little Dude opens his eyes.</LD>
<LD>   Now Mr. and Mrs. Otis are talking to Mrs. Moss.</LD>
<TE>   They start walking straight toward us. My heart thumps halfway out
of my chest.</TE>
<TE>   I pull out my lucky stone and press it into Little Dude's hand.</TE>
<TE>   He stiffens. "I can't take this! It's your lucky stone."</TE>
<TE>   "I want you to have it. Don't argue."</TE>
<TE>   He aims another low-five at me. I bend down to meet it. He grabs
my hand.</TE>
<TE>   Mr. and Mrs. Otis stop to talk to each other. Then they come up
close.</TE>
<TE>   Mrs. Otis says, "Boys, we want to talk to you."</TE>
<TE>   Little Dude tells her, "When you left, I thought you were mad at
me for spilling the punch."</TE>
<TE>   "Oh, no," she says. "We do our best thinking on wheels. Every year
we drive around after the picnic and talk. We didn't know if we'd
ever find the right child."</TE>
<TE>   Child, she said. Just one. I'm not going to be the one.</TE>
<TE>   Mr. Otis takes a deep breath. "Deon, when we overheard you give
your good-luck stone to Lionel, that did it. We just knew that the
two of you should stay together. How would you like to share a
bedroom at our house?"</TE>
<TE>   Share a bedroom?</TE>
<TE>   Little Dude punches his fist into the air. "All right!" he yells
at the top of his lungs. "Now we really will be brothers!"</TE>
<TE>   Tears sting my eyes. I can't let them spill over. That wouldn't be
cool. I grumble at Little Dude, "Do you always make so much noise?"</TE>
<TE>   Mrs. Otis bends down and says, "Guess what we're going to buy
first? 'Star Wars' sheets for both your beds."</TE>

<HD>Gotta Have It</HD>
<DH>Magazine's team of savvy young shoppers 'hot picks' coolest
fashions</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MICHAEL QUINTANILLA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>LAS VEGAS</DL>
<LD>Doug MacInnis has just been "hot picked" by two 17-year-old girls.
"Awesome" he says, chatting up the teens who have declared his retro
rock concert T-shirts--emblazoned with the Who, the Doors and Miles
Davis--"sweet." Translation: cool.</LD>
<LD>   Never mind that their parents grooved to these musical legends,
Natashia Lewis of Woodland Hills and Ashley Jackson of Cincinnati
agree the garments deserve their "Hot Pick" tags of righteous teen
style.</LD>
<LD>   MacInnis realizes that the trend-spotting duo from Teen People
magazine may be too young to vote, but their nod to his Jonny Rock
creations is as solid as a vote for "American Idol's" Kelly Clarkson.
So he proudly displays the "sweet" badges.</LD>
<TE>   "This is as good as a celebrity endorsement," MacInnis says as the
two politely apologize for not hanging around to gab at his booth
during last week's MAGIC trade show for store buyers. The girls are
shopping, in a manner of speaking. So are the other two girls and two
guys who beat out thousands of the magazine's readers for the free
trip, $50 and the challenge to sniff out trends for the monthly's
staff and advertisers.</TE>
<TE>   Lewis and Jackson scramble off, maneuvering a maze of products on
a football field-sized convention floor at the Sands Expo Center,
searching for whatever catches their fancy. In other words: stuff a
girl's gotta have.</TE>
<TE>   In one day, the style posse will whittle an initial 50 picks each
down to two. The next day they'll rap about their selections in a
panel discussion before retailers eager to learn which items the
young shoppers predict to have "ka-ching" power. Teenagers 13 to 17
spent $21 billion on apparel--their biggest expenditure, followed by
entertainment--in 2001, up 4% from the year before, according to
NPDFashionworld, a market information firm based in Port Washington,
N.Y.</TE>
<TE>   The trend spotters shamelessly love clothes, visiting malls five
to 10 times a month, spending anywhere from $250 to $1,500. They play
fashion like a game of blackjack, sometimes forking over entire
paychecks from their part-time jobs to buy looks they believe will
have style longevity. But here, they can only browse. And jot down
notes about color, fabric and price as if researching a term paper.</TE>
<TE>   For nearly six hours, Lewis and Jackson and the other scouts, ages
16 to 20, roam among the 3,000 clothing and accessories booths that
exhibitors have set up in various convention halls tempting visitors
with vintage-looking tops and dresses, jewelry, paint-your-own
tattoos and denim with every imaginable rinse application, bleached
to near extinction. At the Sands alone, more than 1,000 vendors lure
buyers with the newest, latest and hippest this and that.</TE>
<TE>   But the sleuths, paired in three teams and shadowed by three
chaperons, are nobody's fools. They've done the bohemian/hippie
chic/disco diva/surfer dude/hip-hop/denim-to-death style thing.
They've created their own rebellious looks, deconstructed clothes,
frayed and fringed garments, turned them upside down and inside out
with nothing more than scissors and a razor. And whenever possible,
sure they'll break school dress codes.</TE>
<TE>   "We can't wear spaghetti straps, can't show any midriff even when
you raise your hand, skirts and shorts can't measure more than 6
inches from the middle of your knee and up," Jackson laments. And get
this, she says, laughing, "no fringed or frayed jeans because that's
a fire hazard."</TE>
<TE>   On this day their radar is homing in on "what's next" not "what's
now." They're too savvy for even the slickest of hawkers in this
carnival sideshow atmosphere, though many tempt these pop-culture
human sponges with silly come-ons and promises of one-of-a-kind
looks.</TE>
<TE>   "Look at this, we're the only ones with this vintage look,"
announces a woman holding up a brown boogie-woogie 1940s sheath.</TE>
<TE>   "I've seen that same brown color on vintage stuff everywhere,"
says Jackson, a lover of all things that look thrift-shop cool. "I'm
waiting to see some fun colors, something that will catch my eye. But
right now I don't see anything. Where's green? Yellow? Pink? I want
something new."</TE>
<TE>   As if on cue, she spots a retro pink, cherry-print cotton dress
inspired by Marilyn Monroe, says its designer, Nicole Beckett, in a
sweetly alluring MM-like voice. "I love cherries," Jackson tells her.
"This is definitely something I would buy" and hot picks the dress
she describes as school-and date-appropriate and would meet the
parent test. The dress, which will retail for $35, is edgy enough to
become one of her two selections, along with a French terry
miniskirt.</TE>
<TE>   Like her new pals, Jackson's no pushover. Neither is she easily
swayed by advertising gimmicks nor duped by low-quality stuff with
high prices. She's loyal to certain brands but open to others. Most
purchases are planned, but like the others, she never leaves a mall
empty-handed, even if it's with an inexpensive pair of earrings.</TE>
<TE>   Soon a collective profile that could be dubbed "Secrets of Sin
City Teen Shoppers" emerges as the group huddles on the floor at
day's end exhausted, backpacks used as pillows. They share
information with each other and again the next day with grown-ups at
the panel session.</TE>
<TE>   They agree that among the trendiest brands are Hot Kiss, Guess,
Rampage and XOXO. Their favorite quality brands are Abercrombie &amp;
Fitch, French Connection, Polo and Express. For value: Old Navy. For
the hippest advertising, unanimously Target. The chain also garners
high marks for one-stop shopping: cosmetics, jeans, jammies,
T-shirts, "you name it," Lewis says, everyone nodding.</TE>
<TE>   Their fashion direction comes from music videos, young celebrities
like Mandy Moore (not Britney Spears, a favorite of preteens), their
peers and the movies--not high-fashion magazines like Vogue. "We
don't want to buy things worn by women in their 30s," says Lewis, a
credit card shopper with limits set by her parents, who foot the
bill.</TE>
<TE>   They do make investment purchases, however; especially garments
that can take them from a day at school to a weekend date, and tops
that dress up or dress down a pair of jeans.</TE>
<TE>   "Versatility is my main concern," says Liana Sulgit, 17, of
Cupertino, near San Francisco. "When I shop, I'm not looking for
something I can just wear once. Whether we work or not, teens are on
a budget. We can't spend $75 on a shirt we'll wear only once."</TE>
<TE>   But everyone agrees they will spend $100 or more on well-fitting
jeans they equate with comfort and durability. "I have a pair of
Abercrombie &amp; Fitch jeans I've worn for two years," confesses Sulgit
about her favorite brand, adding she paid close to $80 for the jeans.</TE>
<TE>   "What good is an inexpensive pair of jeans if they don't fit
well?" says Lewis, an academic prodigy who graduated from USC at 16
and is beginning on a joint medical and doctorate program at UCLA. In
her spare time, she enjoys karaoke and acting. Her final two choices
are low-rise, resin-coated jeans by Mudd, a brand she buys, and black
suede Carlos Santana sandals.</TE>
<TE>   Chris Heinz, 17, from Naperville, Ill., near Chicago, admits to a
denim dependency. He owns 30 pairs and is crazy for Sean John's new
luxe Blue line--especially the oxidized and painted jeans--that lands
in stores later this month. Those $260 jeans are among his six hot
picks, but his final two are a color-popping Custo of Barcelona
long-sleeved T-shirt and brown-tinted Guess? jeans, each slightly
under $100.</TE>
<TE>   Heinz was impressed by how designers "are becoming more detailed
about the color of the stitching on the sides of jeans or how the
neck of a shirt is cut. Maybe they're paying attention because we're
paying attention. They're just not tossing stuff together and
assuming teenagers will buy anything. I respect that, which is why
I'd buy it."</TE>
<TE>   Variations on cookie-cutter fashions are also welcome. Enough
already "with the same old stuff," says Kristin Martinez, 20, a
University of Nevada, Las Vegas coed studying criminal justice. From
her 10 hot picks, including bellybutton lighted jewelry (she raises
her top to reveal her own $200 jeweled bellybutton ring), her two
winners: A Jonny Rock "Madonna" hooded top, frayed at the edges, and
dirty-looking jeans (made by, duh, Dirty Jeans) with a brown suede
stripe down the sides, tuxedo-style.</TE>
<TE>   Loyal to certain brands, the experience of trend spotting "opened
my eyes to more than just XOXO," says Martinez, who also gleaned
ideas for sewing and reinventing her wardrobe, something she did in
high school. These days she spends $200 to $300 per shopping trip.</TE>
<TE>   In contrast, Peter Dunn, 16, of New York City is big on spending
little ($5 on thrift-store shirts he slashes sleeveless) and
bleaching his own jeans. "I did these myself," he says, showing off
jeans he "whiskered" by brushing bleach across the front with a
stencil pattern photocopied from another pair.</TE>
<TE>   Dunn's two picks are a Lucky brand mechanic-inspired jean jacket
and jeans with a permanent wrinkle from Sean Jean's Blue line. Both
give a vintage edge to the teen's urban-preppy style.</TE>
<TE>   "If you're wearing something that no one else has and you got it
cheap at a thrift store, that's even cooler," he says, adding he
spends $60 and more a month on jeans but not on baggies. That look is
"slowly going out of style. A lot of guys are going for fitted,
boot-cut trousers. Guys have become so fashion-savvy, paying more
attention to their appearance. That's really what fashion is about."</TE>
<TE>   Sulgit agrees. "When I leave the house in the morning and look at
myself in the mirror, I have to like what I'm wearing. Sometimes
people will wear something because that's what everybody else is
wearing or because that's what Britney Spears wore. But there's a
reason why Britney wore it, and that's why I don't wear it."</TE>
<TE>   Lewis says she's as picky as they come. "That's really the only
way we can empower ourselves as teenagers when we shop--by being
selective. With every purchase we say something about the clothes we
are buying because we really are an important consumer. We should
have a say in what is being created for us."</TE>
<TE>   For two days, they did. The verdict? For all of their predictions,
the most startling development was how unpredictable teenagers can
be, says Jorge Ramon, Teen People's fashion director.</TE>
<TE>   "I was blown away by hearing how the cost of something isn't that
important with these kids when all along I thought price would be a
real big concern," Ramon says of the third trend-spotting team sent
to MAGIC. "It seems that style and fit are their main concerns, and
price really fell by the wayside," he says. "The whole marketing of
teenagers is such an important thing because as we found out today,
the recession isn't affecting these guys."</TE>

<HD>'McPaper' at 20: A Brief List of Successes</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TIM RUTTEN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Return with us now to those thrilling days of yesteryear, when
mainstream journalistic standards were such that people thought the
advent of USA Today threatened civilization.</LD>
<LD>   Twenty years ago this month, Al Neuharth--then Gannett's chairman
and chief executive--launched America's first general-interest
national newspaper. It was a new kind of glitzy digest, brief, breezy
and colorful and--with the exception of its weather page--almost
universally derided by serious editors and reporters. It pandered,
most analysts said, to nonreaders whose brains were being fried by
overexposure to MTV, which was then a year old. USA Today was
journalism's contribution to the fast-food culture--McPaper, candy
for the glazed eyes of the sleep-deprived, overscheduled and
attention-deficient.</LD>
<LD>   The Vandals entered linguistic history after their sacking of
Rome, and Neuharth, who held his glittering launch party in
Washington D.C., might have won a similar niche. But the adjective
used to denounce him already had been claimed by, among others,
Attila the Hun.</LD>
<TE>   USA Today lost $458 million during its first four years and $1
billion before it turned a profit. But, during the last decade, it
has upgraded its staff, engaged occasionally in outbursts of original
reporting and even opened a handful of foreign bureaus. With a daily
circulation of 2.3 million, it is now the first successful mass
readership daily created since World War II--a small, fixed point of
generic reassurance to America's new class, the laptop-toting
business travelers whose working lives are lived everywhere and
nowhere, and whose notions of community usually involve e-mail and
the corporate intranet.</TE>
<TE>   Still, for many working journalists, there are few things quite so
depressing as poking their heads out of a hotel room and finding USA
Today hanging on the handle. On the other hand, so many things so
much worse have happened to print and broadcast journalism over the
intervening years--think Fox News--that it also is possible to talk
about McPaper's contributions, which are real.</TE>
<TE>   First among these was the quick read. Neuharth insisted that
newspapers had to acknowledge that their readers lived in a
media-saturated world, one where pictures moved and were in color,
where connections were instantaneous, where time was short and
attention spans were even shorter. That reality presented a problem
for conventional newspapers. If the answers Gannett's team came up
with weren't always satisfactory, the questions they asked were good
ones.</TE>
<TE>   Second, according to Orville Schell, dean of UC Berkeley's
Graduate School of Journalism, "Neuharth showed true genius in his
understanding and audacity in imagining that he could create a
national newspaper. He accomplished something monumental--a global
paper that ordinary people actually read."</TE>
<TE>   Up to that point, the conventional wisdom was that America was too
big and varied to support a national paper, as the Western European
nations and Japan long had. (As the financial elite's bible, the Wall
Street Journal was the great exception, of course.) But absent USA
Today's example, it is hard to imagine that the New York Times, which
is today America's de facto national newspaper of quality, would have
pursued that role with the confidence it has.</TE>
<TE>   And though many of USA Today's critics remain generally
unimpressed, they also admire some of the traits that have allowed
the paper to survive and prosper.</TE>
<TE>   Former Washington Post editor Ben Bradlee was one of USA Today's
most public critics when it debuted, and he still uses an epithet to
describe Neuharth. Many, in fact, credit Bradlee with coining the
McPaper quip, though he said this week, "I don't think I did. I was
quite critical, but I think the paper is much better than when it
started, mostly because Neuharth retired. There are even times when
you're stuck in a town where you can't get a good local paper--where
they're truly awful--that it is a pleasure to have USA Today."</TE>
<TE>   Bradlee also said that USA Today has "proved something about story
lengths that I can only envy. A lot of newspapers, mine and the Los
Angeles Times included, run these interminable stories that I'm
absolutely convinced nobody reads. I think stories can be shorter and
that you distort your paper when you don't discipline them to be
shorter. They've handled that well." The former Post editor also
credits USA today with doing a better job with foreign news and said,
"their sports is pretty good."</TE>
<TE>   Academic analysts are divided on USA Today's standing.</TE>
<TE>   "In many ways they've been pioneers in things that have become
commonplace throughout journalism," said Martin Kaplan, who directs
the Norman Lear Center at USC Annenberg School of Communications.
"They pioneered front page stories with no jumps and even though
they've abandoned that, they've kept their stories short. When Time
and Newsweek redesigned their magazines, they moved totally in that
direction. Everything they do now is USA Today-sized.</TE>
<TE>   "Another of USA Today's contributions is their use of graphics,
especially their charts and diagrams. Their weather page is
consistently the best in print journalism. Finally, you have to
credit them with pioneering the use of color for graphics and
photographs. When they began doing it, serious journalists regarded
color as a downscale commodity. By embracing it as enthusiastically
as they did," Kaplan said, "the people at USA Today risked having
their alleged betters look down their noses at them. They now have
the satisfaction of seeing quality journalism following their lead."</TE>
<TE>   But USA Today still reminds Schell of Mark Twain's remark about
Wagner's music: "It's not as bad as it sounds." To the Berkeley dean,
USA Today is "better than a really terrible paper. But it's still
like a blind date with a woman you instantly know you don't ever want
to see again. There's just something of the paper's soul that eludes
me as a reader. It feels as if there's nobody quite there.</TE>
<TE>   "If you were marooned on an island and it was all you could get, I
guess it would be adequate in the same way a network newscast is.
It's never surprising, which may be part of its genius. It doesn't
shock, jolt, disturb or provide any of that interesting marginalia
that is truly interesting to serious newspaper readers. Those readers
are always looking for what you can't get anywhere else. With USA
Today, it's all something you can get somewhere else."</TE>
<TE>   So, have USA Today's 20 years helped make American journalism more
accessible or more simple-minded?</TE>
<TE>   A little of both.</TE>
<TE>   "Overall, I think they've been a good thing," said Kaplan. "I'm
not sure what a careful content analysis of their stories would
reveal, but I think short equals dumb is not a blanket summary of
what they're really like. The pressure to be interesting and engaging
is not necessarily a vulgarizing thing for journalism. They've
created a healthy, competitive environment for other papers.
Visually, they attract the eye and inform people in a way that sets
important new standards."</TE>
<TE>   Bradlee remains unmoved. "I don't think it improved journalism a
hell of a lot. They have put the news in a more lively and attractive
package, which is a force for good. I guess what I'm trying to say is
that they made a paper a lot of dumb people can read."</TE>

<HD>Remaking Martha: off Pedestal, on Tees</HD>
<DH>Stewart fans sport chef hats, aprons and T-shirts in
support of her--or just for fun</DH>

<LD>She's the woman we love to hate, who can turn out a flawless peach
cobbler without mussing a single hair on her perfect blond head. But
now, weeks after Martha Stewart's ImClone stock troubles began, there
is evidence that popular opinion about the domestic goddess may be
turning. That is, if fashion is any indication.</LD>
<LD>   "Saturday Night Live" star Jimmy Fallon wore a "Free Martha
Stewart" T-shirt to open the Nasdaq market in New York last week.</LD>
<LD>   Since the SaveMartha.com Web site was launched in July, it has
received more than 2 million hits and is now reporting brisk sales of
"Save Martha" T-shirts, chef's hats and aprons, according to site
editor John Small.</LD>
<TE>   "We really are a fan site, but we deal with a serious issue, which
is the double standard and misogyny in business and in the media.</TE>
<TE>   "Save Martha stands for more than Martha Stewart. Whether it's
Carly Fiorina at Hewlett-Packard or Hillary Clinton, the media tends
to turn against strong women," said Small, a New York-based business
and political consultant.</TE>
<TE>   At Y-Que Trading Post in Los Feliz, sales of $10 ''Free Martha
Stewart'' T-shirts like Fallon's have been on the rise. ''It's taken
a little while for the Martha tees to kick in,'' said store manager
Haili Britton. Other styles designed by Y-Que owner Billy Tsangares
feature images of Stewart behind bars, or slogans such as ''I Don't
Do Inside-Trading!'' and ''God Save the Queen.''</TE>
<TE>   The "Free Martha" shirts are a takeoff on the "Free Winona" shirts
created by Tsangares after Winona Ryder was arrested in December on
charges of shoplifting.</TE>
<TE>   "The Martha shirts are more popular with boomers than with younger
shoppers, who still are hot for the Winona tees," Britton said,
adding, ''I'm 23, and I'm with the younger generation. We all hate
Martha.''</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Bag to the Stars</TE>
<TE>   Ferragamo may be better known for matronly, bow-topped shoes than
for cutting-edge accessories, but the Italian fashion house is trying
to change all that.</TE>
<TE>   For fall, Ferragamo is touting its new Salvatore bag as a
must-carry. Shaped like a doctor's bag, it is modeled after a
pony-skin briefcase the late designer carried in the 1940s and '50s
when he worked in Hollywood.</TE>
<TE>   According to company lore, he used the bag to carry tools to the
movie studios where he custom-designed shoes for Marilyn Monroe,
Audrey Hepburn, Lauren Bacall and others. In 1923, Ferragamo began
his career as "shoemaker to the stars" when he opened a small shoe
design and repair shop on the corner of Hollywood Boulevard and Las
Palmas Avenue.</TE>
<TE>   Salvatore bags come in three sizes in black calf, black or brown
pony skin ($455 to $895). Available at Ferragamo boutiques.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   School of Mentors</TE>
<TE>   L.A.'s Otis School of Fashion has scored an impressive list of
fashion designers to volunteer their time to be mentors this year.
Students (who started classes last week) will receive design
assignments and direction from Henry Duarte, Bob Mackie, Michelle
Mason, Rick Owens, Cynthia Rowley, Jeremy Scott, Diane von
Furstenberg, Trina Turk and others. Who knew back to school could be
so glamorous?</TE>

<LD>Medical technology--In an Aug. 30 story in the Business section on a
new nanotechnology tool for detecting infectious disease, Roy Doumani
of the California NanoSystems Institute was quoted as saying that
transforming such sophisticated science into a commercially viable
product would be difficult. Doumani was referring to nanotechnology
in general, not the specific device featured in the article, which he
said would be relatively simple to produce.</LD>

an incorrect location for the Crayola Factory. The factory and
hands-on visitor center is in Easton, Pa., not Easton, Md.</LD>

<HD>Growth in Services Slows</HD>
<DH>Economy: Index of non-manufacturing industries shows August
at slowest pace since January, falling short of experts' forecasts.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The U.S. services sector, the largest part of the economy, grew last
month at the slowest pace since January amid signs that consumers are
paring spending.</LD>
<LD>   The Institute for Supply Management's index for retail,
construction and other non-manufacturing companies fell to 50.9 last
month, close to the level of 50 that separates growth from
contraction. August's reading was lower than the 53.1 in July and the
weakest since it was 49.6 in January.</LD>
<LD>   Economists had expected a reading of 54 in the index, which is
based on a survey of 375 companies in 17 industries. Six of those
industries reported a decline in business last month, led by
communications and transportation.</LD>
<TE>   Services account for five-sixths of the $10-trillion U.S. economy
and include industries such as entertainment, utilities, health care,
farming, insurance, retail, restaurants and zoos.</TE>
<TE>   The institute, based in Tempe, Ariz., said corresponding indexes
measuring new orders, inventories and exports also fell, and
employment contracted for the 18th month in a row.</TE>
<TE>   The group's report is a companion to its manufacturing survey,
which this week showed that factory orders declined in August for the
first time in nine months. The overall factory index was at 50.5,
matching July's reading, which was the weakest since January.</TE>
<TE>   The institute's manufacturing index suggests that Thursday's
report from the Commerce Department of a surge in July bookings will
be short-lived. The government reported a 4.7% jump in July orders,
following a 2.5% decline in June.</TE>
<TE>   In another economic report, the Labor Department said states
received 403,000 initial claims for unemployment benefits in the week
that ended Saturday, down from a revised 411,000 in the prior week.
Still, the less volatile four-week average rose for a fourth straight
week to 400,000 from 394,750.</TE>
<TE>   The Labor Department also reported that the productivity of U.S.
workers rose at a 1.5% annual pace in the second quarter, higher than
the estimate last month of a 1.1% increase. The second-quarter gain
follows an 8.6% surge in the first three months of the year.</TE>
<TE>   "Companies in general have been quicker to lay off people and
slower to rehire," said Stephen Stanley, an economist at Greenwich
Capital Markets Inc. in Greenwich, Conn. "At a time when companies
are not able to raise their prices, they've been able to squeeze
costs out of the production process."</TE>

<HD>Intel Lowers Sales Outlook Slightly</HD>
<DH>Semiconductors: The company expects third-quarter revenue
at the lower end of previous estimates. It blames weak back-to-school
buying.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ALEX PHAM</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Buffeted by a weak economy that tempered back-to-school buying, Intel
Corp. said Thursday that its third-quarter revenue probably would
come in slightly below previous expectations.</LD>
<LD>   The world's biggest semiconductor company said sales probably
would be $6.3 billion to $6.7 billion, down from its previous
estimate of $6.3 billion to $6.9 billion, for the quarter ending
Sept. 28.</LD>
<LD>   Though the adjustment is minor, it suggests that a technology
recovery is unlikely this year as consumers hold off buying computers
and businesses continue to wait for a broad economic recovery before
resuming significant spending on new technology, analysts said.</LD>
<TE>   "It's pretty clear that the sluggish economy and the retrenchment
of consumers have combined to pressure near-term PC demand," said
Mark Edelstone, an analyst with Morgan Stanley who gave Intel an
"equal weight" rating, meaning Intel is expected to perform on par
with other semiconductor companies followed by the investment banking
firm. "It's painfully clear we're not seeing the normal demand
patterns."</TE>
<TE>   Shares of the Santa Clara, Calif.-based chip giant rose to $15.66
in after-hours trading after the company's forecast. Its price had
fallen $1 to a multiyear low of $15.11 in regular trading on Nasdaq.</TE>
<TE>   "Microprocessor unit sales are at the lower end of the normal
seasonal range," said Intel's president, Paul S. Otellini.</TE>
<TE>   He also said sales in Asia and Japan were "softer than we
expected."</TE>
<TE>   Intel last week cut prices for nearly all chips by as much as 52%.</TE>
<TE>   Chip companies traditionally have benefited from back-to-school
buying in the third quarter. This year, however, the effect is muted
by consumer skittishness.</TE>
<TE>   The back-to-school bump in sales "is going to be less than people
expected," Otellini said.</TE>
<TE>   Revenue for the chip industry has languished since last year, when
the market suffered its worst decline.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts forecast a slow recovery. UBS Warburg last week cut 2002
estimates. It said this year's chip revenue could fall as much as 2%
or rise as much as 2%. It previously predicted sales would be
unchanged or grow as much as 5%.</TE>

<HD>Long-Term Mortgage Rates Decline Further</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DARYL STRICKLAND</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Mortgage rates, after spending nearly all summer at the lowest levels
in more than three decades, are still falling and may not have
bottomed yet.</LD>
<LD>   Rates on 30-year loans dipped Thursday to an average of 6.15% from
6.22% a week earlier, according to a survey by secondary mortgage
investor Freddie Mac. The decline marked the third time this summer
that rates have sunk to a new low since the company began tracking
mortgages on a weekly basis in 1971.</LD>
<LD>   Investors, worried about the stock market and the sluggish
economy, have been pouring money into government bonds, driving
yields to generational lows. Mortgage rates tend to track government
bond yields. On Thursday the 10-year Treasury note yield fell to a
new 40-year low of 3.93%.</LD>
<TE>   Home loan rates are expected to stay between 6% and 6.37% through
the end of the year, said Frank Nothaft, economist at Freddie Mac.
For rates to fall sharply from current levels, he said, the economy
would have to dip into a recession or receive some other shock.</TE>
<TE>   "The rates should remain about where they are," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Or maybe go even lower, said James Nutter Jr., a mortgage
executive in Kansas City, Mo. If the stock market gets worse, Nutter
said, rates could hit 5.75% in coming months.</TE>
<TE>   Though cheaper mortgages have made home buying more affordable
nationwide, a new report suggests that a growing number of
Californians are losing ground.</TE>
<TE>   The percentage of those able to purchase a median-priced home in
July dropped to 28%, down from 32% a year earlier and unchanged from
the previous month, the California Assn. of Realtors said.</TE>
<TE>   Median prices, meaning half cost more and half cost less, in July
hit a record $323,700. In Los Angeles County, the affordability rate
fell to 31% from 35% a year earlier. An even sharper drop occurred in
Orange County--to 22% from 28%.</TE>
<TE>   But the index, which assumes a 20% down payment, does not take
into account rising home equity that other analysts said could make
move-up purchases more attainable.</TE>
<TE>   Despite expectations that the pace of transactions will slow in
coming months, sales remain at a record rate in the U.S. and
statewide, industry groups said. They believe cheaper financing will
keep the market stable.</TE>
<TE>   Falling rates also have put refinancings on a rapid clip, the
Mortgage Bankers Assn. of America said. Homeowners seeking loans at a
lower rate of interest accounted for 71% of total mortgage
applications last week, about the same as a week earlier, the group
said.</TE>
<TE>   Rates fell on most other kinds of home loans this week, Freddie
Mac said. The rate on 15-year fixed mortgages slipped to 5.56% from
5.64%. But a one-year adjustable-rate loan rose slightly to 4.35%
from 4.34% last week. Those rates carried add-on fees of 0.6% this
week.</TE>

<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>CKE Restaurants Inc. reported a fiscal second-quarter profit,
reversing a year-earlier loss, but also lowered expectations for its
fiscal year, sparking a 25% drop in its stock price Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   Citing strong results at its Carl's Jr. fast-food chain, the Santa
Barbara company posted net income of $10.8 million, or 18 cents a
share, for the quarter ended Aug. 12, compared with a net loss of
$36.8 million, or 73 cents a share, for last year's second quarter.</LD>
<LD>   The company, which was formerly headquartered in Anaheim and still
has Orange County operations, forecast fiscal 2003 earnings at 50
cents to 52 cents a share, saying it is still six months away from
unveiling a "comprehensive" plan to drive sales at its Hardee's
chain, which it acquired in 1997. The company had been expected to
earn 59 cents, according to an average estimate by three analysts
polled by Thomson First Call.</LD>
<TE>   "The company's doing the right thing," said Avondale Partners
analyst Amy Greene. "I'd rather them be prudent than aggressive with
us. There are lot more pieces to the rebranding and marketing
campaign than they had previously anticipated, so its going to take
longer to get it done."</TE>
<TE>   The company reported total revenue of $337.2 million, down from
$340 million for last year's second quarter.</TE>
<TE>   CKE stock dropped $1.81 to $5.49 a share on the New York Stock
Exchange.</TE>
<TE>   Some analysts said the market was overreacting to the company
news.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a difficult environment for all the restaurant operators,"
said Fulcrum Global Partners analyst Greg Schroeder.</TE>
<TE>   "Everyone is experiencing a slowdown in traffic, so I think this
company's being overpenalized. But it's a turnaround story and you
need to have confidence that Hardee's is moving in the right
direction, and we did not have that confirmation today," Schroeder
said.</TE>

<HD>Former Chairman Buys $7.8 Million in ICN Bonds</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>ICN Pharmaceuticals Inc.'s former chairman, Milan Panic, is adding to
his investment in the Costa Mesa drug company he founded, buying
almost $8 million worth of its convertible bonds on the open market,
a regulatory filing shows.</LD>
<LD>   The 72-year-old executive, who founded ICN in a Los Angeles garage
in 1959, resigned as chairman and chief executive in June after
dissident shareholders won a proxy fight to gain control of the
company's board. ICN shares have lost almost half their value since
mid-July.</LD>
<LD>   Panic bought the convertible subordinated notes with a face value
totaling $7.8 million between Aug. 20 and Aug. 23, according to a
filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The notes can be
converted into 227,700 shares of ICN stock with a current market
value of $2.3 million. He directly owns 1.04 million ICN shares, the
filing said.</LD>
<TE>   "I lost enormous money, but I have confidence the company is in
very good shape," Panic said in an interview.</TE>
<TE>   ICN shares plunged on July 11 after the new chief executive,
Robert O'Leary, said excess inventory at wholesalers would have to be
winnowed down, cutting revenue by as much as $12 million in each of
the third and fourth quarters this year.</TE>
<TE>   ICN shares rose 12 cents Thursday to $10.20 on the New York Stock
Exchange.</TE>
<TE>   The stock closed at $19.95 a share on July 10.</TE>
<TE>   Panic is now buying bonds as an alternative way of betting on
ICN's eventual recovery. He didn't disclose in the SEC filing how
much he paid for the notes, which carry an interest rate of 6.5% and
mature in 2008.</TE>
<TE>   An investor who buys notes with a $1,000 face value at Wednesday's
discount price of $680 would receive annual interest payments of $65,
providing a yield of almost 10%. Panic said such a return was a big
attraction for him.</TE>
<TE>   "At my age, you have to worry about income," he said.</TE>

<HD>Union, Shipping Lines Report Contract Progress</HD>
<DH>Labor: Negotiators say the tone of talks has improved.
Jesse Jackson leads L.A. rally.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NANCY CLEELAND</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As the Rev. Jesse Jackson led a boisterous union rally in Los Angeles
supporting West Coast dockworkers, negotiators in San Francisco made
substantial progress in closely watched contract talks on Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   The longshore union and shipping lines signed a tentative
agreement on health benefits, then dove into the difficult terrain of
technology. Employers and union members have strongly different
opinions about how to introduce technology needed to improve
efficiency at the ports.</LD>
<LD>   Representatives from both sides remarked on the improved tone of
the talks, which began in May and broke down briefly over the Labor
Day weekend.</LD>
<TE>   "In my opinion, the glass is half full," said Joseph Miniace,
president of the Pacific Maritime Assn., which is negotiating for
major shipping lines. In a change from the last few months, Miniace
said he would stay out of negotiating sessions, allowing committees
to work out details.</TE>
<TE>   In Los Angeles, Ramon Ponce de Leon, a member of the International
Longshore and Warehouse Union negotiating team, attributed progress
to support from other unions and public officials. Ponce de Leon was
with Jackson at the rally with union leaders and dockworkers at the
Los Angeles County Federation of Labor, where Jackson criticized
White House officials for intervening in contract talks.</TE>

<HD>Retail Sales Sluggish in August Across Spectrum</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ABIGAIL GOLDMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Retailers last month got off to a slow start in the fall shopping
season as hot weather, staid fashions and a still-languishing economy
kept consumers from malls and discount centers.</LD>
<LD>   Chain store sales in August were barely better than flat, with a
year-over-year gain of 1% in stores open at least a year, according
to Goldman Sachs' tally of retail sales performance. Bank of
Tokyo-Mitsubishi pegged its index of same-store sales at gaining 1.6%
over August of last year.</LD>
<LD>   "It's weak, in some cases surprisingly so, because it appeared
that some areas weakened very rapidly, such as Sears appliance
sales," said Michael Niemira, senior economist at Bank of
Tokyo-Mitsubishi. "It was clear early in the month that the numbers
were not going to be very strong and then Labor Day wasn't enough to
offset the weakness."</LD>
<TE>   Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co. said sales at stores open at least a year
fell 11.1% from a year earlier, while total domestic store revenue
for the four weeks ended Aug. 31 fell 8.7% to $2 billion.</TE>
<TE>   For the most part, sales were disappointing across the industry,
with even top-tier companies in the discount arena under-performing
or coming in at the low end of their sales plans.</TE>
<TE>   Wal-Mart Stores Inc., the world's biggest retailer and routinely
one of the sector's strongest players, reported slightly
lower-than-expected August sales with a gain of 3.8% in stores open
at least a year. The company had planned a sales gain of 4% to 6%.</TE>
<TE>   Target Corp.'s namesake stores, another top performer in the
retail industry, barely came within analysts' sales expectations of a
flat to 2% rise, with a same-store sales gain of 0.5%.</TE>
<TE>   Sales in stores open at least a year, or same-store sales, are
considered a good measure of continuing health because they exclude
new and closed stores.</TE>
<TE>   Although the sales numbers seem to indicate that consumers
continue to monitor spending, the retail sales numbers released
Thursday tell only part of the story, Niemira said. August was the
best-selling month for domestic auto sales in nearly a year, as
consumers took advantage of no-interest financing deals, which may
have siphoned dollars away from other discretionary purchases.</TE>

<BD>Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Microsoft Corp. said all versions of its Windows operating system
released since 1996 and its word-processing and Web-viewing software
for Apple Computer Inc.'s Macintosh computers have a security flaw
that could let a hacker steal passwords or credit cards.</LD>
<LD>   The world's largest software maker called the weakness "critical,"
its most serious of three ratings, in a security bulletin.</LD>
<LD>   A software patch to fix the vulnerability is available for some
versions of Windows, and Microsoft urged users to download it
immediately from www.microsoft.com.</LD>
<TE>   The error affects products beginning with the Windows NT 4.0
server program that went on sale in July 1996. The earliest PC
version with the flaw is Windows 98, released in June 1998. Windows
2000 and Windows XP, the most recent versions of the operating
system, also are affected.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Struggling French media giant Vivendi Universal may sell its
publishing business for as much as $5 billion, sources familiar with
the matter said.</LD>
<LD>   Vivendi is in talks with private equity firms, including
Blackstone Group and Apax Partners, to sell Boston book publisher
Houghton Mifflin as well as its entire European book publishing
operation.</LD>
<LD>   New Vivendi Chief Executive Jean-Rene Fourtou previously had
indicated the company was not planning to unload the European
publishing business. But as he seeks to close a much-needed
$2-billion loan from European creditors, Fourtou is said to be
weighing all options to stem a cash crisis.</LD>
<TE>   Vivendi last week sold its French magazine business and its
struggling Internet venture Vizzavi. The company's plans for
Universal Studios and its other U.S. assets remain unclear.</TE>

<HD>Group Files Suit Over French Fries</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>McDonald's Corp. and Diageo's Burger King Corp. hid that the oil used
to cook their French fries may contain a chemical suspected of
causing cancer, an environmental group alleged in a lawsuit.</LD>
<LD>   The nation's largest sellers of French fries are violating
California's Proposition 65, which requires manufacturers to warn
consumers of dangerous chemicals, the Council for Education and
Research on Toxics said in a suit filed in Los Angeles. The suit said
fatty starchy foods cooked at high temperatures contain high levels
of acrylamide, a suspected carcinogen.</LD>
<LD>   Anna Rozenich, a spokeswoman for Oak Brook, Ill.-based McDonald's,
said she hasn't seen the suit. Officials at Burger King didn't return
calls seeking comment after hours.</LD>
<TE>   The group is asking a judge to order the restaurants to provide a
"clear and reasonable warning" to customers about acrylamide and to
fine the companies $2,500 a day for each violation of Proposition 65.
McDonald's shares fell 27 cents to $21.97 and Diageo fell 8 cents to
$48.13, both on the NYSE.</TE>

concluding that neither Orbitz nor the airlines that own it have used
"unfair methods of competition" against agents.</LD>
<LD>   In a complaint filed in March, the 24,000-member travel agents
society alleged that the airlines had tried to sabotage the agents by

<HD>Suit Names 2 Banks in Slatkin Ponzi Case</HD>
<DH>Fraud: Filing by estate trustee says Comerica and
UnionBanCal earned millions in fees.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>UnionBanCal Corp. and Comerica Inc. aided Earthlink co-founder Reed
Slatkin's Ponzi scheme that solicited more than $590 million from
investors, according to a suit filed by his estate's bankruptcy
trustee.</LD>
<LD>   Slatkin this year agreed to plead guilty to 15 felony changes in
connection with the investment scheme and acknowledged responsibility
for at least $254 million in losses. He filed for bankruptcy in 2001.
In a Ponzi scheme, early investors are paid off with money collected
from later investors.</LD>
<LD>   The suit filed by R. Todd Neilson, the Chapter 11 trustee of
Slatkin's estate, claims that Slatkin could not have executed his
scheme without the help of the banks, who allegedly earned millions
in fees from the fraud. The trustee for a bankruptcy estate works
with the creditors committee to regain what money they can for the
estate.</LD>
<TE>   The suit seeks at least $250 million in compensatory damages and
unspecified punitive damages.</TE>
<TE>   "The banks gave Mr. Slatkin the aura of legitimacy he needed to
continue to fool his victims," according to the 41-page suit, filed
in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles. "The banks didn't support Mr.
Slatkin's scheme for free, however."</TE>
<TE>   Joanne Curran, a spokeswoman for UnionBanCal, said the bank does
not comment on litigation. The San Francisco-based company is
California's second-largest bank. The suit said UnionBanCal in May
1999 purchased the trust business of Imperial Trust Co., which
allegedly held the accounts of Slatkin's investment club and offered
him a $2.5-million unsecured line of credit.</TE>
<TE>   Slatkin resigned last year from the board of Earthlink. The U.S.
Internet provider has said Slatkin's activities were separate from
the Atlanta-based company.</TE>
<TE>   Slatkin collected money from investors from 1985 until April 2001,
telling them he would buy securities on their behalf, prosecutors
said. Instead, they said, Slatkin provided false statements that
showed fabricated returns and used the money to pay country club fees
and purchase cars and artwork.</TE>
<TE>   Calls to two spokespeople at Comerica Bank Thursday were not
returned.</TE>
<TE>   The suit also named Bank of Orange County, the successor to
Pacific Inland Bank. A call to the Fountain Valley-based bank was not
returned.</TE>

<HD>Shell to Put Its Name on Texaco Stations</HD>
<DH>Energy: Customers in Southern California should notice the
switch in the next few months.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NANCY RIVERA BROOKS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The red star will become a yellow seashell at about 75 Texaco service
stations in Southern California over the next few months.</LD>
<LD>   Houston-based Shell Oil, a unit of Royal Dutch/Shell Group,
announced in February that it would spend more than $500 million to
put its name and logo on most of the 13,000 Texaco gasoline stations
it bought last year from ChevronTexaco Corp. Southern California is
one of the places where Shell is starting the conversion, which
should be completed nationwide by late next year, Shell spokesman
Cameron Smyth said Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   "Customers should start to notice a change soon," Smyth said.</LD>
<TE>   Before Chevron Corp. and Texaco Inc. merged and were forced to
divest the Texaco stations, the Shell and Texaco brands were owned by
two joint ventures: Equilon in the West and Motiva in the East. Shell
bought out Texaco's stake in the two ventures.</TE>
<TE>   Shell owns slightly more than 700 Texaco stations and nearly 1,300
Shell stations in California, selling about 10% to 12% of the state's
gas, Smyth said. Texaco will linger for a few years on a small number
of stations where the dealers with contracts to use the Texaco name
chose not to switch to Shell, he said.</TE>

<HD>U.S. Firms Seek Quotas on China Textiles</HD>
<DH>Trade: Southern California apparel makers oppose the
restrictions, which they say could spark a protectionist backlash.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>EVELYN IRITANI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Domestic textile manufacturers battered by the retail slowdown and a
surge in cheap imports filed a petition Thursday with the U.S.
government seeking temporary restrictions on imports of knitted
fabric and apparel from China, which is fast becoming a center for
global manufacturing.</LD>
<LD>   After China joined the World Trade Organization last year, the
U.S. lifted the quotas on some Chinese apparel and textile products.
That led to a sharp increase in Chinese textile imports--up 119% in
the first six months of this year--and a collapse in prices,
according to the American Textile Manufacturers Institute, a
Washington trade group, which filed the petition. In one case,
imports of Chinese knit fabric ballooned 22,000% from the same period
the previous year and the price per kilogram dropped from $12.66 to
$5.03.</LD>
<LD>   "We always knew China would increase rapidly but people are
stunned by the size of the increase," said Cass Johnson, a spokesman
for the institute, which is asking for quotas to be temporarily
reimposed on knitted material, gloves, bras, nightgowns and fabric
luggage.</LD>
<TE>   But Southern California textile and apparel makers oppose the
measure, saying they are more likely to be hurt than helped by
measures that could spark a protectionist backlash from U.S. trading
partners. This split exposes a growing divide between the large
Southern textile makers that compete against low-cost foreign
producers and California's smaller trade-dependent firms that have
carved out a niche serving higher-end, fashion-oriented customers.</TE>
<TE>   "They are trying to protect what is left of their commodity-based
industry and we want open access to foreign markets," said Ilse
Metchek, executive director of the California Fashion Assn., a trade
group representing textile and apparel makers. "If that means opening
our doors to imports, so be it."</TE>
<TE>   Already under fire from its trading partners for recent actions to
protect steelmakers and farmers, the U.S. is in the awkward situation
of responding to yet another controversial request for support from a
politically powerful industry. Taking such a step also would make it
more difficult for the U.S. to pressure China to open up its economy
to U.S. farmers and high-tech firms and strengthens the position of
those within China who opposed the decision to join the WTO,
explained Nicholas Lardy, a China expert at the Brookings
Institution.</TE>
<TE>   Lardy predicts that this will be the first of many battles over
China's growing domination of the U.S. textile and apparel market, a
reflection of that country's low wages and increasingly efficient
manufacturing base. Most of China's gain in the U.S. market has come
at the expense of other developing countries.</TE>
<TE>   But U.S. firms have not escaped unscathed, as the increase in
low-cost goods from China has pushed down prices for everyone. The
U.S. textile and apparel industry has been losing ground against
low-cost imports for decades, but China's recent expansion came at a
particularly bad time because of the overall slowdown in the U.S.
economy. Textile institute spokesman Johnson called 2001 the "worst
year since the Great Depression," with the closure of 116 textile
mills and a loss of 67,000 jobs, including 1,000 in Los Angeles
County.</TE>
<TE>   China's share of the global market is expected to increase as the
U.S. and other countries complete a total phase-out of global textile
and apparel tariffs by 2005. But under pressure from U.S.
negotiators, China agreed when it joined the WTO to allow other WTO
members to apply temporary quotas if a surge of Chinese imports
disrupted the market. That restriction will remain in place until
2008.</TE>
<TE>   The domestic manufacturers filed their petition with the U.S.
Committee for the Implementation of Textile Agreements, an
interagency group responsible for overseeing regulation of textile
and apparel trade. If the petition is approved, there will be a
60-day period for the U.S. and China to negotiate the size of the
quotas, which would be in place for one year.</TE>
<TE>   Given the political strength of the Southern textile lobby and the
upcoming elections, the U.S. government may find it "politically
expedient" to approve the quotas, said Brenda Jacobs, counsel for the
U.S. Assn. of Importers of Textiles &amp; Apparel.</TE>
<TE>   She said the importing community is disappointed but not surprised
by the action and most firms have taken steps to diversify their
suppliers in case of a restriction on China trade.</TE>

<HD>Rep. Lewis Opposes Cadiz Plan</HD>
<DH>Water: The Redlands congressman cites ecological concerns
in urging the MWD to drop the Mojave Desert storage project.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MICHAEL A. HILTZIK,</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Adding to the chorus of environmental opposition to the Cadiz water
storage project, U.S. Rep. Jerry Lewis (R-Redlands) has urged the
Metropolitan Water District of Southern California to reject the
$150-million program on grounds that it might threaten the delicate
ecology of the Mojave Desert.</LD>
<LD>   In a letter to MWD Chairman Philip J. Pace, Lewis, whose district
includes the site of the proposed project, noted its "possible impact
on desert wildlife and the nearby Mojave National Preserve" and said
"it is not in the best interest of your Southern California customers
to become dependent on desert ground water."</LD>
<LD>   The MWD board is likely to vote sometime in the next few months on
whether to go forward with the 50-year program, which it would
jointly fund with Cadiz Inc., a Santa Monica company whose chairman
and chief executive, Keith Brackpool, is a prominent financial
supporter of Gov. Gray Davis and an advisor to Davis on water supply
issues.</LD>
<TE>   Cadiz said through a spokesman that the issues Lewis raised have
been examined by a range of federal environmental agencies, whose
review "culminated with the issuance of the final federal
environmental approval last week.... We look forward to working with
Congressman Lewis to address his concerns and begin moving forward on
this critical program for the future of California's water."</TE>
<TE>   Although Lewis said in an interview Thursday that he shared
concerns about this region's looming shortage of water--which exists
in part because of scheduled cutbacks in supply from the Colorado
River--"I'm a long way away from signing off on this project."</TE>
<TE>   Cadiz aims to store up to 1.5 million acre-feet of surplus water
from the Colorado River in the sands under company land in the desert
northeast of Palm Springs, extracting it via a 35-mile pipeline for
use by MWD customers in dry years. (One acre-foot of water is roughly
enough to serve two families for one year.)</TE>
<TE>   Environmental opposition has focused on a second component of the
program: the extraction of up to an additional 1.5 million acre-feet
from an existing natural aquifer under the property, which opponents
say could lead to contamination of surrounding water supplies by
draining more water than is naturally replenished.</TE>
<TE>   Lewis' letter, which was dated Aug. 30, came the day after the
Interior Department gave its final environmental approval to the
project.</TE>
<TE>   The department, which controls the land over which the pipeline
would run, endorsed a plan to monitor the condition of the aquifer
via $2.8 million worth of testing wells.</TE>
<TE>   But Lewis said that as long as scientific disagreement exists
about the safe level of extraction of desert ground water, "I came to
the conclusion that we ought to move with great caution."</TE>
<TE>   Lewis' position mirrors that of Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.),
who has asked the MWD to reject the project and introduced
legislation that would bar the Interior Department from spending
money on permits for the Cadiz program after Oct. 1.</TE>
<TE>   Feinstein has said the legislation is designed to stop the project
until the Interior Department "has taken all the necessary measures"
to ensure that the Mojave water supply will not be compromised.</TE>

<HD>CBS Sticks With Masters Plan</HD>
<DH>Media: Despite pressure from women's groups and Augusta
National's decision to drop ads, the network says it will stay the
course.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SALLIE HOFMEISTER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>CBS plans to televise the Masters golf tournament in April despite a
potentially searing public relations campaign that links the network
with sex discrimination practices.</LD>
<LD>   One reason is the tournament is a ratings juggernaut, the most
prestigious and widely watched event in golf. CBS also does not want
to lose the tournament to a rival network, which media sources say
would jump at the chance of wresting control of the Masters and
breaking a 46-year tradition at CBS.</LD>
<LD>   The Masters is one of the few sporting events that is not a loss
leader for broadcasters. CBS will continue to break-even on the
Masters, even as the network is expected to lose as much as $108
million on other sports programming this coming year, said analyst
Richard Bilotti of Morgan Stanley.</LD>
<TE>   "Activist threats and boycotts are endemic in the network business
so if CBS dropped the Masters, it would send a bad signal," said Alan
J. Bell, the new chief executive of Freedom Communications Inc.,
owner of the Orange County Register and a TV station group that
includes five CBS affiliates. "The Masters has been a tradition on
CBS since the network first existed. It brings attention to the
programs that run after it, no one else has it and it's not costly."</TE>
<TE>   Bell also said that televising the tournament is not synonymous
with endorsing the practices of the Augusta National Golf Club, the
exclusively male fraternity that is the home of the prestigious
Masters.</TE>
<TE>   Since June, Martha Burk, chairwoman of the National Council of
Women's Organizations, has been pressuring the Georgia golf club to
open its membership to women. Burk was rebuffed again last Friday,
when Hootie Johnson, Augusta National's chairman, announced that next
year's tournament will be commercial-free as a way to keep the three
sponsors--Coca-Cola Co., Citigroup Inc. and IBM Corp.--from being
pressured by the group to drop their support.</TE>
<TE>   The move will make the Masters the only commercial-free sporting
event on broadcast TV.</TE>
<TE>   Now, Burk is threatening to turn up the heat on CBS, which has
televised the event since 1956 under an unusual year-to-year
contract. Burk is demanding that CBS drop the telecast if there is
not a woman member of Augusta National by April. She also is
threatening to examine CBS' management for female representation as
part of her mission.</TE>
<TE>   But CBS, whose highest-ranking woman is entertainment president
Nancy Tellem, has no intentions of dropping the telecast, spokeswoman
Leslie Ann Wade said.</TE>
<TE>   The American public seems to be siding with CBS. In a CNN/SI.com
poll Tuesday, 87% of the respondents said CBS should continue to
broadcast the Masters.</TE>
<TE>   PGA Tour player John Daly said Thursday that he staunchly opposes
clubs that don't allow women. Then he was asked if he would consider
sitting out the next Masters. "I would not consider that," Daly said.
"If I got into Augusta, I would play....It's a tournament we dream as
little kids of winning. Women protesting it shouldn't take it out on
us for playing in it."</TE>
<TE>   And sports-equipment maker Nike Golf, which has endorsement deals
with Tiger Woods and David Duval, among others, would not try to
influence players to skip the Masters, marketing director Chris Mike
said. "Our players play many, many tournaments a year and I can't see
any situation where ... we would ask somebody not to play a
tournament."</TE>
<TE>   Media analysts say CBS faces little risk from continuing to
televise the Masters. "The only way you can really hurt networks is
by taking away their advertising," said Larry Gerbrandt, chief
content officer of Kagan World Media, a market research firm in
Carmel, Calif. "[Burk] has already done the damage, so CBS doesn't
have a whole lot to lose. There could even be a bronze lining for CBS
in keeping affiliates happy and generating goodwill with viewers
because the event will be commercial-free."</TE>
<TE>   Even before the latest uproar, the relationship between CBS and
the Masters was a novelty in the sports world. Most sports-rights
holders have taken advantage of the popularity of TV sports and
cutthroat competition among broadcast and cable bidders to secure
record prices and long-term contracts. Most major sports contracts
run from four years to 10 years. Broadcasters and cable programmers
pay a premium for these packages because they draw in elusive male
viewers whom advertisers pay top dollar to reach and who otherwise
may not see promotions for the network's other shows.</TE>
<TE>   By these standards, the Masters is cheap and its year-to-year
contract with CBS is old-fashioned. The structure of the deal has
long been a closely guarded secret, but sources close to CBS estimate
the network pays $7 million to $10 million a year for the right to
broadcast the Masters. NBC paid an estimated $13 million for this
year's Ryder Cup match between American and European golfers.</TE>
<TE>   Networks typically offset these costs by selling advertising at
top rates. But during coverage of the Masters advertising has been
limited to only four minutes an hour, about one-fourth the norm.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to constricting commercial time, Augusta National
keeps tight control over which advertisers are allowed in. CBS and
cable programmer USA Networks, which airs about five of the 13 hours
of tournament play, negotiate the terms with the advertisers lined up
by the golf club.</TE>
<TE>   Augusta National even determines CBS' profit. Under the unusual
partnership, the golf club has added up the costs of the event each
year, including the estimated $2 million or more CBS and USA spend to
produce it, and charged them off to the advertisers.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, CBS generated $9.4 million in network advertising from
the Masters, a 10% gain from 2000, according to Competitive Media
Reports in New York. Advertisers paid an average $205,000 per
30-second Masters spot, slightly higher than in the World Series.</TE>
<TE>   With its decision to drop advertising, Augusta National has agreed
to reduce the rights fee that CBS and USA pay to make up the
difference. That will make the Masters a costly event for the golf
club, which this year distributed $5.5 million in prize money and an
additional $3.3 million to charity.</TE>
<TE>   Some pundits wonder whether this could change the old-fashioned
feeling of the event as Augusta National looks to cover its increased
costs. In the commercial world of sports, the Masters remains an
anomaly, charging only $1 for sandwiches and $125 for a weeklong
ticket to a perfectly groomed course free of corporate logos and
signage. Even drinks are served in cups that match the tournament's
famous green jacket.</TE>

Associated Press was used in compiling it.</TE>

<HD>Health Insurance Costs Surge</HD>
<DH>Study: Employers' premiums increase an average of 13%,
while double-digit increases in workers' out-of-pocket expenses are
reported in survey.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DON LEE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Underscoring the increasing strains in America's health-care system,
a comprehensive survey shows that workers' health insurance costs
surged 27% this year for individuals and 16% for families, at the
same time many employees saw their benefits reduced.</LD>
<LD>   The average premium increase for employers was 13%--the highest
since 1990--and marked the second straight year of double-digit
inflation, according to the study released Thursday by the Kaiser
Family Foundation and the Health Research and Educational Trust.</LD>
<LD>   The increase was driven largely by larger insurance claims
stemming from higher prices for hospital services and prescription
drugs and consumers' growing demand for health care.</LD>
<TE>   The survey and separate interviews indicate no letup in premium
increases in the foreseeable future. A sobering 78% of the more than
2,000 small and large businesses that responded to the survey said
they probably would increase the amount their workers must pay for
health coverage next year.</TE>
<TE>   If current trends continue, the study's authors said, some
businesses will stop offering health benefits to their workers, while
some low-income wage earners will decline coverage because they will
no longer be able to afford their share of the costs.</TE>
<TE>   Whereas the average cost of employer-provided health insurance for
a family now is $8,000 a year, for example, by 2005 the cost for such
a policy could reach $11,000.</TE>
<TE>   "With increasing health-care costs and a sputtering economy, we
will see an increase in the ranks of the uninsured," Drew Altman,
president of the Menlo Park, Calif.-based Kaiser Family Foundation,
told a news conference in Washington. In 2000, the U.S. Census Bureau
estimated 39 million Americans were without health coverage.</TE>
<TE>   Yet none of the researchers expects a comprehensive political
response. Congress has considered but not passed limited health-care
measures, such as a Medicare prescription drug benefit and health
insurance tax credits. And revenue-strapped states are trimming
rather than expanding budgets for public health insurance programs
for poor families and children.</TE>
<TE>   "Government regulation is not in the cards," Altman said.</TE>
<TE>   Although the 13% surge in insurance premiums came as no surprise,
experts at the Kaiser Family Foundation and the Health Research and
Educational Trust said they were struck by how much workers already
were sharing in the pain.</TE>
<TE>   Aside from their sharp increase in premiums, workers saw their
deductibles and co-payments increase significantly as well, the
survey found. A growing number of employers also took steps to limit
prescription drug coverage and eliminate retiree benefits.</TE>
<TE>   "Across virtually every indicator, we found bad news for workers,"
Altman said. He said workers should expect more of the same in the
future--to pay more and get less for their health
coverage--especially if the economy remains sluggish.</TE>
<TE>   About two-thirds of all Americans under 65 are covered by
employer-sponsored health insurance. During the booming late 1990s,
more small businesses offered health insurance and larger companies
provided richer benefits to attract and keep workers. But those
trends faded as the economy sputtered and employers' health insurance
costs, driven largely by higher spending for drugs and hospital
services, rose steadily, from 5% in 1999 to 8% the next year to 11%
in 2001, according to the Kaiser surveys.</TE>
<TE>   The latest annual increase was still less than the 18% jump in
1989, when runaway costs pushed many employers to latch on to managed
care and fueled contentious debate over universal insurance.
Nonetheless, this year's 13% increase in employer health insurance
premiums is about seven times the rate of overall inflation. The
increase was spread uniformly across regions, industries, types of
insurance and even size of business.</TE>
<TE>   Faced with increasing health insurance costs, 17% of employers
offered fewer benefits this year, the study showed. That "could be
the beginning of a trend," said Diane Rowland, executive vice
president of the Kaiser Family Foundation.</TE>
<TE>   And the rate hike figures to get even higher next year, according
to insurance executives, benefit consultants and major
employer-purchasing groups.</TE>
<TE>   Peter Lee, president of the Pacific Business Group on Health, said
his member companies are looking at premium increases generally in
the mid to high teens. Some are much higher: The California Public
Employees' Retirement System, or CalPERS, agreed to a 26% increase in
HMO premiums for next year.</TE>
<TE>   "Over the long term, employers will be sharing more of the costs
than in the past," said Lee, whose San Francisco-based group
negotiates rates for 47 large employers in California that cover 3.5
million people.</TE>
<TE>   Employers and others have blamed the soaring costs on excessive
profiteering by big insurers and hospital chains. Although some of
those companies have in fact reaped huge profits, the Kaiser study
determined that the underlying cause of the current round of
spiraling health costs was a rise in medical claims--driven in turn
by the aging population, advanced technology and the loosening of
controls over managed care that has led to increased use of medical
services.</TE>
<TE>   It would be easy to blame hospitals, drug companies and any number
of health-care providers, Altman said, "but at the end of the day, I
suppose the enemy is us, the American people. We want more medical
technology, we want it in our community and we want it now."</TE>
<TE>   Recent surveys by the Kaiser Family Foundation, which is not
related to Kaiser Permanente, have shown declining enrollment in
health maintenance organizations as membership has shifted to the
less restrictive and more pricey preferred provider organizations, or
PPOs. But the new Kaiser health costs survey indicated an uptick in
HMO membership over the last year.</TE>
<TE>   Jon Gabel, a vice president of the Health Research and Educational
Trust, the Kaiser partner in the study, said it was logical that
would happen. As cost-sharing for employees increases, he said, more
lower-income people in particular will be inclined to sign up for an
HMO, which generally doesn't come with deductibles and coinsurance,
which is the percentage of a hospital bill or doctor's services that
patients must pay themselves.</TE>
<TE>   The average annual premium for employer-sponsored health insurance
this year was $3,060 for single coverage, and the typical employee's
share was $454, or about 15%. For family coverage, the yearly premium
averaged $7,954, of which the employee picked up $2,084, or 26%,
according to the survey.</TE>
<TE>   The Kaiser report is part of a study of health costs that began 14
years ago and is one of the most authoritative studies on
employer-based health insurance trends. The latest study surveyed
3,262 randomly selected public and private employers from January to
May.</TE>

productivity growth and disappointing retail sales, hit Wall Street
hard Thursday and sent stocks falling sharply.</LD>
<LD>   The sell-off more than offset the market's advance Wednesday,
which skeptical analysts had attributed to bargain hunters, not
investors ready to commit to stocks.</LD>
<LD>   "Everyone is definitely looking at the data on the economy, and
they really want to see some glimmers of hope that we are going to
get a pickup in profit growth. Without that happening so far, people
are a little skittish," said Joseph Keating, chief investment officer
at AmSouth Asset Management in Birmingham, Ala.</LD>
<TE>   The geopolitical backdrop also weighed on investors. Worries about
a possible U.S. attack on Iraq rose as the rhetoric from the United
States and the Arab world heated up, and violence in Afghanistan and
a thwarted car bombing in Israel added to the day's jitters.</TE>
<TE>   Technology stocks were among the hardest hit. The Nasdaq composite
index closed at its lowest level in a month, down 41.31 points, or
3.2%, at 1,251. The Nasdaq 100, more concentrated in tech issues,
slid 4.1% as 93 of its 100 members lost ground.</TE>
<TE>   The Dow Jones industrials fell 141.42 points, or 1.7%, to
8,283.70, after losing as many as 208 points early in the day, and
the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index dropped 14.25 points, or 1.6%, to
879.15.</TE>
<TE>   Losers outnumbered winners by more than 2 to 1 on Nasdaq and the
New York Stock Exchange. Trading was weak, as it has been for more
than two weeks.</TE>
<TE>   Investors were bracing for a mid-quarter update from Intel. The
chip maker fell $1 to $15.11 in the regular session, as apprehension
about future earnings grew ahead of its update, due after the bell.</TE>
<TE>   After the close, Intel reported that revenue probably would come
in slightly below the midrange of its previous estimates. Intel's
stock regained some of the lost ground in after-hours trading.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts said investors also are nervous about the possibility of
a war with Iraq and the anniversary of the Sept. 11 terrorist
attacks.</TE>
<TE>   "I hate to use 9-11 as an excuse, but I think there is genuine
apprehension and grief going into it," said Scott Bleier, president
of Hybridinvestors.com.</TE>
<TE>   Among the disappointing economic news Thursday was a report that
productivity of U.S. companies grew in the second quarter at its
slowest pace of the year. In another report, new claims for
unemployment benefits fell last week, but still were at a level that
indicates a soft labor market.</TE>
<TE>   The Institute for Supply Management also had disappointing news,
saying its non-manufacturing index for August stood at 50.9, below
the 54 reading analysts were anticipating. And the Commerce
Department reported that orders to U.S. factories rose less than
expected in July.</TE>
<TE>   "Everyone is looking to see that there is some traction taking
place in the economy. And the data just continue to say we are not
accelerating," Keating said.</TE>
<TE>   Treasury yields fell for a fourth session, remaining at depths not
seen in four decades. The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury
note slid to 3.93%, from 3.96% on Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   Gold rose $3.30 to $318.20 an ounce. Oil gained 71 cents to $28.98
a barrel in New York on worries of Mideast turmoil and news that the
U.S. crude stockpile fell.</TE>
<TE>   In other highlights:</TE>
<TE>   * Retailers were among Thursday's losers, falling on disappointing
August same-store sales, those at stores open at least one year.
Abercrombie &amp; Fitch dropped $1.91 to $21.86 on a 3% decrease in
same-store sales. May Department Stores, which say same-store sales
decline 8.6%, fell $1.14 to $27.61.</TE>
<TE>   * Procter &amp; Gamble emerged as a bright spot, rising $1.29 to
$89.85. The Dow component raised its earnings forecast for the fourth
straight quarter.</TE>
<TE>   * Financial stocks took a dive as Congress widened its probe of
Wall Street. Goldman Sachs fell $2.61 to $72.89, and Citigroup lost
$1 to $29.30.</TE>
<TE>   * Stocks in Japan rallied 1.6% after seven straight losing
sessions. However, the benchmark Nikkei index was lower in early
trading today.</TE>
<TE>   * Railroad stocks were derailed. Burlington Northern Santa Fe lost
$1.59 to $26.90, Union Pacific fell $2.43 to $58.51 and CSX tumbled
$5.60 to 29.03.</TE>

<HD>Martha Stewart's Phone Used in Call to Waksal</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ABIGAIL GOLDMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A congressional committee examining Martha Stewart's sale of ImClone
Systems Inc. stock has found a possible new discrepancy in her
account to investigators, a panel spokesman said Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   Stewart has said she and former ImClone Chief Executive Samuel D.
Waksal did not speak between Dec. 14 and Jan. 5. But records from a
rented mobile phone used by Stewart and an employee show a
five-minute call to Waksal's personal mobile phone on Dec. 31, said
Ken Johnson, spokesman for the House Energy and Commerce Committee.</LD>
<LD>   The employee of Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia Inc., who was
traveling with Stewart in Mexico at the time, told investigators that
she did not make the call to Waksal, Johnson said.</LD>
<TE>   "We believe someone has lied to the committee and possibly has
conspired to obstruct a congressional investigation," Johnson said.
"Her [Stewart's] story has evolved over time; there has been a long
list of inconsistencies."</TE>
<TE>   The panel is investigating Stewart's sale of nearly 4,000 ImClone
shares Dec. 27, the day before the company disclosed that its cancer
drug Erbitux had been rejected by the Food and Drug Administration.</TE>
<TE>   The committee, chaired by Rep. W.J. "Billy" Tauzin (R-La.), will
announce as early as Tuesday what, if any, action it will take
against Stewart, Johnson said.</TE>
<TE>   Those options include subpoenaing her to testify before Congress,
referring findings to the Justice Department for review and
recommending criminal charges against Stewart.</TE>
<TE>   A Stewart spokeswoman could not be reached for comment.</TE>
<TE>   Waksal, who has been charged with securities and bank fraud,
perjury and obstruction of justice, is accused of trying to sell
ImClone stock Dec. 27--and advising family members to do
likewise--after learning that the FDA was planning to announce its
rejection of Erbitux.</TE>
<TE>   Stewart has said she sold her ImClone holdings Dec. 27 because of
a prearranged agreement with her Merrill Lynch broker to sell if the
stock dipped below $60, as it did that day.</TE>
<TE>   But congressional investigators point to that statement as an
example of what they have called a pattern of changing her story.</TE>
<TE>   Originally, Stewart's lawyers told investigators that the
so-called stop-loss order had been in place since late October.</TE>
<TE>   But investigators responded that the stock dipped below $60 twice
in November and no sale was triggered.</TE>
<TE>   Stewart's legal team then said they had been mistaken, that the
stop-loss order was entered in late November, Johnson said.</TE>
<TE>   Johnson declined to say what action the committee would take in
the matter, saying it still had some work to do before an
announcement could be made.</TE>
<TE>   "We have given Ms. Stewart every opportunity to meet voluntarily
with our investigators and she has refused all of our overtures,"
Johnson said. "As a result, that leaves us with few options."</TE>

<HD>NewCom Officers Indicted in Fraud, Conspiracy Case</HD>
<DH>Tech: Three executives and an outside director are charged
with falsifying financial records of the defunct Westlake Village
firm.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>E. SCOTT RECKARD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Three officers and a director of NewCom Inc., a defunct Westlake
Village tech firm, were charged Thursday with falsifying company
financial records in a case federal prosecutors portrayed as an
example of the Bush administration's pledge to crack down on
corporate greed.</LD>
<LD>   The criminal fraud and conspiracy case is the latest development
in a long investigation of NewCom and its majority owner, Aura
Systems Inc. of El Segundo. The firms' former top executives agreed
in June to pay fines and be barred from running public companies to
settle federal civil charges that they overstated sales by tens of
millions of dollars during the late-1990s boom years.</LD>
<LD>   NewCom, founded in 1994 as a wholly owned subsidiary of Aura,
became a public company in September 1997 when 30% of the company was
sold to investors.</LD>
<TE>   Its collapse in May 1999 wiped out stock holdings once valued at
nearly $140 million--an example of the corporate debacles that Debra
Yang, the U.S. attorney in Los Angeles, said have "shaken the faith
of Americans" in the nation's financial systems.</TE>
<TE>   "We will weed out corporate corruption driven by personal greed at
all levels," said Ronald Iden, the assistant director of the FBI's
Los Angeles office, which investigated NewCom, a supplier of computer
accessories.</TE>
<TE>   Named as defendants in a 36-count fraud and conspiracy indictment,
unsealed Thursday, were NewCom Chief Executive Sultan Warris Khan,
57, of Calabasas; Executive Vice President Asif Mohammad Khan (no
relation to Sultan Khan), 57, of Westlake Village; and Steven Conrad
Veen, 46, of Downey, Aura's former chief financial officer.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to charges of securities fraud, mail fraud and wire
fraud, Asif Khan and Sultan Khan also are charged with money
laundering. Veen is accused of signing off as CFO on NewCom's
allegedly falsified financial statements.</TE>
<TE>   If convicted of all the charges, Asif Khan and Sultan Khan would
face prison sentences of seven to 12 years under federal sentencing
guidelines. Veen's sentence would be considerably less.</TE>
<TE>   NewCom outside director Alexander Remington, 45, who owned Micro
Equipment Co. in Norcross, Ga., NewCom's biggest supplier, has agreed
to plead guilty to one conspiracy count for his role in the alleged
scam and has been cooperating in the investigation. According to his
plea agreement, Aura and NewCom executives began overstating revenue
from Micro Equipment from NewCom's start.</TE>
<TE>   Attorneys for the defendants said they all intended to plead not
guilty at their arraignment Monday. They were released on appearance
bonds of $500,000 apiece for Asif Khan and Sultan Khan, and $200,000
for Veen.</TE>
<TE>   "The indictment involved complex commercial transactions, and we
see them differently from the prosecution," said Tom Pollock, an
attorney for Sultan Khan. Pollock said his client "looks forward to
resolving the situation favorably."</TE>
<TE>   Jan Handzlik, Asif Khan's lawyer, said his client "believes that
the substantial control exercised by Aura over NewCom's business
affairs will significantly affect the outcome of this case."</TE>
<TE>   Mark Harris, Veen's attorney, couldn't be reached for comment.</TE>
<TE>   Assistant U.S. Atty. Pamela L. Johnston, the lead prosecutor on
the case, said the investigation remains open with other individuals
as targets.</TE>
<TE>   Asif Khan, Sultan Khan and Veen were among those who settled civil
charges filed by the Securities and Exchange Commission in June. The
agency said Aura reported at least $26.5 million in fictitious sales
in 1997 and 1998, and NewCom falsified its balance sheet by at least
$43.2 million in 1998 and 1999. Also settling with the SEC was Zvi
"Harry" Kurtzman, Aura's founder, whom the SEC described as a
"recidivist" offender of securities fraud laws, citing a 1996
cease-and-desist order the agency had obtained against Kurtzman.</TE>
<TE>   Kurtzman, who appeared in court to post Veen's bond, declined to
comment. Sources familiar with the case, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said he remains a target of the investigation. Kurtzman
maintains that he and Aura were defrauded by Asif Khan and Sultan
Khan, according to another source.</TE>
<TE>   Aura hired Asif Khan and Sultan Khan in 1994 to set up NewCom,
according to the indictment, which alleges that they soon devised an
overbilling and kickback scheme with Remington's company.</TE>
<TE>   The goal was to raise cash to help Asif Khan and Sultan Khan repay
a $2-million debt from their involvement in an embezzlement at a
computer company where they had worked previously, the indictment
alleges.</TE>
<TE>   Asif Khan and Sultan Khan allegedly netted $1.1 million personally
from the NewCom scheme, Johnston said.</TE>
<TE>   The defendants also defrauded a lender, Actrade Capital Inc., of
$1 million, the indictment alleges.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors said they expect indictments in three or four more
corporate fraud cases in Los Angeles by year-end.</TE>

<HD>Fraud Probe Targets Credit Repair Firms</HD>
<DH>Debt: Consulting companies unable to account for clients'
funds, agencies say.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBERT PATRICK</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>More than 30 consumer credit consulting companies, including two in
Southern California, have been caught up in a nationwide Federal
Trade Commission sweep against credit and telemarketing fraud,
officials announced Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   The Southern California debt negotiation companies, housed in the
same building in Downey, are Jubilee Financial Services Inc. and
Jabez Financial Group Inc.</LD>
<LD>   "The tragedy is just horrific" for clients of the two companies,
said Adrian B. Stern, the court-appointed receiver for Jubilee and
Jabez. Stern has been unable to find $2 million that was supposed to
be held in trust to pay the clients' debts. "My suspicion is that the
number will run much higher," he said.</LD>
<TE>   The FTC action, dubbed Operation No Credit, targeted a wide range
of fraud allegations involving credit repair services, payday loan
companies, debt adjustment programs and advance-fee credit cards.</TE>
<TE>   Officials said that the agency monitors the Internet, e-mail,
consumer complaints and television and newspaper advertisements to
find and target companies for investigation. Jubilee, they said,
stood out.</TE>
<TE>   "They hit our radar screen and they hit it hard," said Tom Syta,
assistant regional director of the FTC's Western region.</TE>
<TE>   Syta said the FTC might bring cases against other "bad actors"
such as Jubilee.</TE>
<TE>   Using advertisements, spam and telemarketers, Jubilee and Jabez
attracted debt-ridden people with promises to reduce their unsecured
debt by 40% to 60%, according to U.S. District Court filings. The
companies kept upfront fees, which could total more than $1,000 for
an individual case, according to the FTC.</TE>
<TE>   Jubilee and Jabez told their clients to stop payment on all
unsecured debt. This, the companies said, would put the individuals
in a "hardship" condition, strengthening their position in
negotiating a settlement with their creditors, according to the
filing.</TE>
<TE>   But clients complained that the companies took their money and did
little or nothing in return, ruining their credit and triggering
creditor lawsuits.</TE>
<TE>   Anaheim resident Dana C. Lester said she was making good progress
in repaying a large debt until she signed on with Jubilee in February
2001 and paid a $1,100 fee. Then she was told to stop making
payments.</TE>
<TE>   After months with no action and no satisfactory response to her
complaints, Lester said, she pulled out of the program.</TE>
<TE>   Through a suit she filed in small claims court, she won back half
of the almost $4,000 she paid the company.</TE>
<TE>   "If I help one person not fall in the trap I did, I'll feel good
about it," Lester said.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. marshals, Downey police, FTC officials and Stern's employees
arrived at the building occupied by Jubilee and Jabez at about 9 a.m.
Aug. 21.</TE>
<TE>   "They just came in and took over and kicked us out," Jubilee
President John E. Gustavsen said in a telephone interview Wednesday
night.</TE>
<TE>   Gustavsen vigorously defended his company and blamed the FTC
action on pressure from bank and credit card lobbyists in Washington,
who he said lose money when Jubilee negotiates repayment of debt.</TE>
<TE>   Many of the FTC allegations are "phony," Gustavsen said. Many
client complaints stemmed from growing pains when Jubilee absorbed
several thousand clients of a Phoenix company, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Gustavsen said it was true that the company told clients to stop
paying their bills because it couldn't negotiate with creditors if
payments were being made. He added that his company warned clients
that "when you're in the program, your credit is going to be
thrashed."</TE>
<TE>   "The people who are complaining are the people who just couldn't
wait" for the program to work, he said. "They quit after their
freshman year and said they didn't get a diploma."</TE>
<TE>   Gustavsen, 70, lives in a Whittier house he purchased last year
for $606,000, according to property records.</TE>
<TE>   Stern said he did not think that the former pastor and insurance
company employee was living a lavish lifestyle with his clients'
money. "He didn't take any trips to Hawaii with 45 people," Stern
said.</TE>
<TE>   Stern said he believed that much of the money went to cover
Jubilee's expenses, including rent and salaries. Gustavsen's 2001 BMW
325 convertible was seized and sold for administrative and legal
expenses, and his personal accounts have been frozen. Gustavsen said
he has no credit cards because of the harm he has seen debt do to
others.</TE>
<TE>   Curtis Cobb, president of Jabez, did not return calls seeking
comment.</TE>
<TE>   Stern said his office has begun notifying the more than 1,400
clients with active Jubilee accounts of the FTC action. "We'll go
after anything and everything we can find," he said, adding, "I am
finding very, very little money."</TE>
<TE>   Stern said he has found more money at Jabez, which has only been
in operation since April. Stern vowed to close both companies and
return as much money to consumers as possible.</TE>
<TE>   Neither Stern nor the FTC has found any relationship between the
two.</TE>
<TE>   FTC officials and credit counselors cautioned people to be wary of
companies that ask for money up-front, charge large fees or tell
individuals to stop paying bills.</TE>

<HD>Koizumi's North Korea Risk</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>VICTOR CHA</AU>
<BD>Victor Cha, an associate professor of government at
Georgetown University's School of Foreign Service, is author of
"Alignment Despite Antagonism: The US-Korea-Japan Security Triangle"
(Stanford University Press, 2000).</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Japan's Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi's trip to North Korea later
this month appears to be a positive development in reducing tensions
on the Korean peninsula. But appearances can be deceiving.</LD>
<LD>   Koizumi's surprise announcement reflects positively on Japan's
attempts to play a leadership role in the region. He appears to be
taking on the thorny problem of North Korea when the fate of South
Korean President Kim Dae Jung's "sunshine policy" of reaching out to
Pyongyang remains uncertain.</LD>
<LD>   Moreover, U.S. ambivalence about engaging North Korea remains
palpable enough that an initiative of this sort by a trusted ally may
yield the transparency needed for Washington to make the decision to
pursue engagement in earnest. Or it may not.</LD>
<TE>   Japan deserves kudos for taking this initiative, but is Koizumi
being set up as the straight man for Bush hawks? Koizumi must not
fall into the trap that Kim did in coming back from Pyongyang with
handshakes and photo ops but no substantive agreements. Indeed,
smiling faces (and nothing else) is just the proof that Bush hawks
need to validate their belief that North Korean leader Kim Jong Il is
not serious about engagement.</TE>
<TE>   The most meaningful issue for Japan and the U.S. relates to North
Korea's No Dong missiles. Hundreds of these ballistic missiles,
unlike the longer-range Taepodong missile, are deployed in North
Korea. Any logical extrapolation of North Korea's strategic doctrine
suggests that these missiles, which can be fitted with chemical
warheads, are targeted on Japan (to deter the U.S. and Japan from
supporting South Korea in a military confrontation).</TE>
<TE>   Can Japan persuade the North to concede on this issue? It's
doubtful. The North refused to discuss No Dong deployments in the
missile negotiations with the U.S. at the end of the Clinton
administration.</TE>
<TE>   So therein lies the problem: Koizumi must come back from Pyongyang
with something of substance, especially since the North so badly
disrespected Tokyo in normalization talks at the end of 2000.
Japanese negotiators were led to believe then that the basic outlines
of a package were in the making. However, it's unlikely that
meaningful missile agreements are in the offing even now. Facing
pressure for results, Koizumi might therefore fall into the trap of
handing over some carrots (such as cash) for small, incremental and
symbolic concessions by the North.</TE>
<TE>   This sort of summit might play in Seoul but not in Washington or
Tokyo. Bush hawks would have their "proof" that engagement with
Pyongyang is fruitless.</TE>
<TE>   Behind this diplomatic theater is a deeper and more disturbing
message. Combined with Kim Jong Il's meeting in August with Russian
President Vladimir V. Putin and persistent entreaties by Beijing and
Seoul, Koizumi's trip could be seen as another voice in the regional
chorus for Bush to support engagement with Pyongyang.</TE>
<TE>   But these voices have the unintended effect of widening a gap in
policy toward North Korea between Washington and its Asian allies.
For the latter, Koizumi's impending trip again validates the merits
of engagement and Kim Dae Jung's sunshine policy. They believe that
engagement will eventually bring the North around. But for the Bush
administration, Koizumi's trip reinforces the efficacy of the harder
line: Calling the regime evil and taking the hawk, not sunshine,
approach has pressed the North into its conciliatory mode.</TE>
<TE>   The further the openings to the outside by North Korea, the wider
this perception gap--and the differences in policy--between the U.S.
and its allies in Asia.</TE>

<HD>Raising Hackles on the Border</HD>
<DH>You first, I decided. My eyes never left his face: You
first.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAGOBERTO GILB</AU>
<BD>Dagoberto Gilb is the author, most recently, of
"Woodcuts of Women" (Grove Press, 2001). A new book, "Gritos" (Grove
Press), will be published in the spring. Director Carlos Bolado's
movie "La Border" is currently in post-production.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>I've just been with a crew doing a documentary about the U.S.-Mexico
border. There were 11 of us: the director, an A and a B camera, a
sound guy, an actor, a writer, a still photographer, two producers
(American and Mexican), a set-design artist and an assistant to the
producer. We were two vans and a red '65 Dodge Dart convertible,
which is what I, the narrator, "drive" through the film, from San
Diego-Tijuana to Brownsville-Matamoros. We were all from diverse
ethnic backgrounds, though as passports go it was six Mexican, five
American. We were a group of well-established, credentialed members
of our respective cultural and artistic communities.</LD>
<LD>   The intention of the movie was not investigative or politically
topical, not intending to weed out evil or quell injustice--not an
expose. Instead, it was an almost personal exploration of the
frontera and its linea, a journey to each and every city and pueblo
on either side. The camera and boom wanted to see and hear what the
border is, how it is, view it through images and impressions of land
and culture, voices and faces of people who are there, experiencing
it.</LD>
<LD>   Yet, of course, it was the border of the United States and Mexico.
That is to say, we started to have hassles in the shoot that weren't
meant for our story.</LD>
<TE>   Like when we wanted to talk to workers coming off a turno, a
shift, from a maquila in Nogales, Sonora. Inside the sheet-metal
hangar-like building, people were lined up, silently, waiting to get
on a bus parked outside. The request was denied; no talking to the
workers or filming inside, and the private security guard was quickly
muttering into his walkie-talkie. A pickup with more uniforms
arrived. Workers were warned not to speak to us.</TE>
<TE>   I walked over to another building and spoke to a couple of workers
from the distant states of Chiapas and Veracruz. I was interested in
how their lives, now on the border, had changed, and they had nothing
but contented things to say about their jobs and conditions and their
move so far from home.</TE>
<TE>   But again we were told to stop filming and to leave immediately. A
hand slapped away the lens, and the cameraman, incensed, protested
that he was on a public street and had every right, as a Mexican
citizen, to film as he pleased. More security arrived; a pickup
positioned itself to pen in our vehicles. We decided to leave, and
after a brief cat-and-mouse on wheels for a few turns, we drove out.
Except we were followed all the way, several miles, to the aduana,
the border crossing, right to where they joined the men in green
military uniforms armed with rifles. We crossed.</TE>
<TE>   Don't you wonder what these Mejicanos were afraid of? Or was it
just the hackles and gaffs of unquestioned power?</TE>
<TE>   That feathered display of power, cocky and mean as a drunk father,
was not only on the Mexican side of the border. One morning we were
one van and one camera, driving the state highway east of Judge Roy
Bean's Bar, named after the once-upon-a-time Only Law West of the
Pecos.</TE>
<TE>   Our camera, hanging out the car window, filmed a Border Patrol SUV
as it dragged a bundle of old tires along the soft dirt roads so
footprints would show up in the sand--the technique for tracking
people crossing illegally. Within a few minutes, we were pulled over.
We explained we were on our way to Seminole Canyon to film the Indian
petroglyphs. The officer kept his distance from the driver's window,
suspicious, but though he asked lots of questions, he finally let us
go. We didn't make the morning tour, so we planned to return later.
When we were pulled over again on the ride back, it was two Border
Patrol SUVs, and at least two more green-uniformed officers, their
hands above their sidearms, standing backup as the officer spoken to
earlier examined our passports. He wrote down our names in a little
notebook and went back to his truck's radio. For some time. He said
he was passing along our names so that we could travel unhindered
later.</TE>
<TE>   Later that afternoon on this same public highway, on our way to
that guided petroglyph tour, we were pulled aside again, this time at
the checkpoint. Told to get out, told to produce passports yet again,
a gray-haired officer was loud in the director's face about what was
it, exactly, he was doing here. That's when I said, "Excuse me, but I
am an American citizen." The officer whipped his index finger within
inches of my face and with a cold, unblinking sneer screamed at me
that he'd talk to me when he decided to.</TE>
<TE>   Which, of course, caused me to stop and think. There were five
good-sized, armed men surrounding the four of unarmed us, their right
hands cocked above their holsters, fingertips close enough for
electrical static to jump from the handles of their weapons. The
senior agent was "impolitely" discussing the border issues, as he saw
it, with us. Where it is. How it is. Who he is, what he does. Where
we are, who we are, who we are not. How if he thought we were doing
any "counter-intelligence," if he thought the story was the Border
Patrol, he could "close us down," see what it was we got there on
that video.</TE>
<TE>   Though his roostering talk was directed toward the director, he
looked at me often. That look of sizing up and threat. Come on, his
aside glances said, I dare you to interrupt, to say anything.</TE>
<TE>   And yes, he was right, I wanted to. Because he disgusted me. I
hadn't wanted to go to blows with someone in years. I stared right
back. You first, I decided. Almost smiling, my eyes never leaving his
face, I stared back: You first.</TE>
<TE>   These are the scenes that aren't going to be in the film. These
are the cliched news stories--la migra and the Mexican guards--that
weren't meant for this documentary. It was what we wanted to skip.
Yet, like chinches in the sheets of a dirty Nuevo Laredo motel bed,
like mosquitoes swarming a humid swamp in Brownsville, they make
bites that you hate for having to scratch, that won't go away
quickly.</TE>

<HD>Terminal Thirst in a Trickle-Down Era</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ARIANNA HUFFINGTON</AU>
<BD>Arianna Huffington is a syndicated columnist.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Like a lung cancer patient reaching for a pack of smokes, the Bush
administration has greeted the latest run of gloomy economic news--a
ballooning federal deficit, flagging consumer confidence, mounting
unemployment--with a nerve-settling puff of its favorite brand of
economic relief: tax cuts for the rich. Considering the imprudence of
that idea, maybe the Bush team members are smoking something a little
stronger than Marlboros.</LD>
<LD>   According to the White House, the proposals being considered
include tax incentives to encourage stock market investment and
capital gains tax cuts--on top of the massive future tax cuts for the
wealthiest Americans already signed into law. As Treasury Secretary
Paul O'Neill said earlier this summer, "This is how we create
economic prosperity--not by strangling people with interference and
regulation and punishing restrictions on trade and job creation, but
by opening the world up."</LD>
<LD>   In point of fact, deregulation and further tax cuts are the exact
opposite of what the nation needs now.</LD>
<TE>   How did the free-market ideology of the Reagan revolution come to
be the political consensus of our times? How did we get suckered by
the fairy tale that as long as people kept shopping, the market could
keep prosperity growing as far as the eye could see? And that by
voting with our credit cards we could spread the gospel of prosperous
democracy to any corner of the Earth where American products were
made or consumed. It's time to acknowledge that this story doesn't
have a happily-ever-after ending.</TE>
<TE>   Over the last 20 years, Americans have been doused with regular
sermons on the supposed correlation between unregulated markets and
higher standards of living. In the process, the American people were
demoted from citizens to consumers and sold a bill of goods about how
the almighty market was the essence of democracy. Accepted notions of
public protections--of the environment, of workers, of the poor--were
scrapped. The market worshippers shredded the modern social contract,
the hard-fought consensus that had emerged since the New Deal and
that ordered our political priorities, our communal concern for the
most vulnerable and our disapproval of huge inequalities. We were now
supposed to believe that all that could be left up to the soulless,
self-correcting calculus of supply and demand. The free market had
become the people's market and would take care of us.</TE>
<TE>   Once the province of Republican supply-siders, this
all-encompassing faith was warmly embraced in the '90s by the New
Democrats. And some old ones too. Even Jesse Jackson rang the opening
bell at the New York Stock Exchange and created a Wall Street
Project.</TE>
<TE>   The media also did their part, hyping stories that made it seem as
if everyone was making money investing. Who can forget the Beardstown
Ladies, those bestselling, stock-pickin' grannies supposedly making
23% returns in the market? Or those millionaires next door, such as
the lowly government auditor who, by patiently investing in stocks,
turned $5,000 into a $22-million fortune?</TE>
<TE>   Stressed out about retirement? Your kids' college tuition? A
family health emergency? Not to worry! The market would take care of
all that. Even being downsized could be made fun and profitable.
After AT&amp;T laid off 40,000 workers in 1996, hedge-fund manager Jim
Cramer wrote a cover story for the New Republic titled "Let Them Eat
Stocks." In it he proposed a simple solution. "Just give the laid-off
employees stock options," he exulted. "Let them participate in the
stock appreciation that their firings caused."</TE>
<TE>   The future that Wall Street had dreamed of for decades--free of
pesky regulators, snooping politicians and profit-sapping social
activists--had arrived. It would take a while--and the fall of Ken
Lay, Bernie Ebbers, Sam Waksal, et al.--before the invisible hand was
exposed as a pickpocket. But even after the free-market parade had to
be called off on account of fraud, not rain, we have begun to hear
the trickle-down marching bands warming up in the distance.</TE>
<TE>   It's time we resuscitated Mark Russell's definition of
trickle-down as "something that benefits David Rockefeller now and
Jay Rockefeller later." Or, to be a bit more current, George Herbert
Walker Bush then and George Walker Bush now.</TE>

<AU>RANAN R. LURIE</AU>
<BD>Ranan R. Lurie is a syndicated columnist and political
cartoonist. He was an Israeli combat major who trained and jumped
with the U.S. 101st Airborne, the paratroopers of the French Foreign
Legion, the British paratroopers and the Israeli special military
skydivers unit.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The world is keeping check on Saddam Hussein as if it were making
sure that Jack the Ripper paid his parking tickets on time.</LD>
<LD>   The international community is doing what it does best: wait and
see.</LD>
<LD>   But President Bush, we know, soon will reveal detailed information
that shows Hussein for the evil that he is. This information will
show that civilization simply cannot afford to haggle with itself
until it is too late.</LD>
<TE>   Once Iraq, a country twice the size of Idaho, has a nuclear
weapon, it won't be considered small anymore.</TE>
<TE>   Time is the only commodity Hussein needs to fulfill his terrible
dream. Every political rally warning against "the war," every
editorial recommending "patience," every running-for-office
politician who "condemns" an attack against Iraq has a death wish.
The problems of uprooting Hussein from his underground bunkers and
laboratories are dwarfs in comparison with the new Holocaust awaiting
us if we don't do so.</TE>
<TE>   That said, Iraq has a history of poor combat performance.</TE>
<TE>   Hussein's army failed miserably against the U.S. coalition forces
in 1991. It could not even handle the inefficient Iranian foot
soldiers for eight years during the 1980s, and it lost the
territories it gained when it attacked Iran.</TE>
<TE>   In October 1973, it sent one armored division to help the Syrians
on the Golan Heights. That unit fell into an elementary but
devastating trap set by the Israelis.</TE>
<TE>   Although it sent a huge army to help its Jordanian brethren just
before the Six-Day War, the Iraqi forces retreated to Baghdad as fast
as they could once the shooting started.</TE>
<TE>   In 1948, Iraq sent to Palestine the biggest military force of all
Arab states--and failed to have any impact on the war results. The
stories about Iraqi officers deserting their trenches while locking
their soldiers in chains so that they could not join them became part
of Israeli War of Independence folklore.</TE>
<TE>   The only two sources of real power that Hussein has today are his
Gestapo-like control of his people and his imminent nuclear threat
capability.</TE>
<TE>   Time is on his side. Therefore, he must be destroyed.</TE>
<TE>   Iraq should be treated as an island state without a navy. The
"ocean" is a combination of the desert (almost half of the country)
and Iraq's hostile neighbors. The "navy" in this case is actually the
air force because in the desert, the one who has the more efficient
air force is the winner before the war even begins. In the desert
there is no place to hide from marauding planes or smart bombs.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. forces can land with a minimum force of no more than a
couple of battalions on the western tip of Iraq that borders Jordan,
take over two old airports named H-2 and H-3 and create an instant
base of operations, probably without suffering casualties.</TE>
<TE>   This act alone would bring tremendous psychological relief to our
fearful ally, Jordan, which would then have a U.S. buffer between it
and Iraq. Because of the short range of Scuds, our control of west
Iraq would eliminate the chances of Iraqi Scuds being launched
against Israel.</TE>
<TE>   The destruction of military barracks and installations would be
even more devastating than in 1991.</TE>
<TE>   The historical statistics lean heavily toward Iraq waving the
white flag again.</TE>
<TE>   We just have to get there in time.</TE>

<HD>A Lose-Lose Campaign</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>GOP gubernatorial candidate Bill Simon Jr. has run a shockingly awful
campaign. Its one plank, Simon's business acumen, has been splintered
to toothpicks by a $78-million fraud judgment against his company and
unofficial accusations that he took $1 million in improper tax
deductions. This week, Simon capped it by heading off to San
Francisco, gay capital of the United States, the day after he
disavowed his signature on a gay-rights questionnaire that his
campaign had answered sympathetically. Did no one in Simon's
scheduling office have his brain turned on?</LD>
<LD>   Given Simon's ineptness, Gov. Gray Davis should be sailing away
with the campaign. But no. Voters apparently so dislike Davis that
he's only seven points ahead of Simon in a Field Poll survey released
Thursday, despite his incumbency and huge campaign chest.</LD>
<LD>   There's more. The number of voters who can't make up their minds
usually declines as the election nears. Not so in this weirdest of
governor's races. The number of undecideds measured by the Field
survey actually increased, to 22%, up from 16%. The more voters see
these candidates, the less they're sure they want to vote for either
one.</LD>
<TE>   The dislike for Davis is not new. Reasons range from his handling
of the energy and budget crises to his crass and constant
fund-raising, which too often seems linked to his policy positions.
Witness his big raises for the well-organized prison guards, who
contributed to him handsomely, versus his back of the hand,
salarywise, to other state employees.</TE>
<TE>   The voters are the losers in this campaign. So are the ballot
propositions that are likely to be rejected if the turnout is small.
California, the most populous, richest state, ought to be able to do
better--but that's an analysis for another time. Simon must improve
his campaign, not just for his own pride but because voters in
November deserve a real choice.</TE>
<TE>   Simon had not run for office or even voted consistently before he
filed for governor. He was stiff and uncertain at first. But
political observers figured he would adapt as the campaign
progressed, tutored by some of the best political consultants money

<TE>   The transformation never happened.</TE>
<TE>   First Simon refused for weeks to release his income tax returns
and then gave in so clumsily and grudgingly that he got no benefit.
It went downhill from there.</TE>
<TE>   As a result, Simon has been unable to give Californians a clear
vision of what he wants to do as governor, if he has one. Confronting
the incumbent Davis, it's up to Simon to make it a race. In the two
months left, perhaps Simon should fire his remaining high-priced
advisors and let voters see whether there's any there there.</TE>

<LD>German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder is causing heartburn at the White
House with declarations that his country is "not available for
adventures" in Iraq. But Schroeder, who is in the middle of a
fiercely contested election campaign, receives roars of approval from
crowds whenever he declares that Germany will not participate in or
help pay for a war. Though there is an element of election-campaign
opportunism in Schroeder's insistence that a war would be a huge
blunder, his statements reflect widespread fears among Europeans.</LD>
<LD>   Schroeder, though he comes from the left wing of the Social
Democratic Party, is no anti-American firebrand. Over the decades, he
has shed his doctrinaire leftism to become a pragmatist standing by
the U.S. against terrorism and for democracy. Germany has stepped up
its surveillance and penetration of Islamic groups inside the
country, and some 10,000 German troops are stationed in the Balkans,
Afghanistan and the Middle East. Indeed, Schroeder was unflinching on
Afghanistan, facing down critics in his own party and its coalition
partner, the Greens, to support deployment in that country.</LD>
<TE>   Schroeder's arguments against a war are grounded not in dislike of
the United States but in realistic apprehensions. He notes that the
Bush administration has presented no compelling evidence that the
threat posed by Iraq justifies a full-scale war; that an assault
could create a surge of hatred in the Arab street that might allow
Islamic militants to topple moderate governments friendly to the U.S;
and that the economic consequences of war, particularly for oil
supplies, could be catastrophic.</TE>
<TE>   Schroeder argues that the goal of the U.S. and its allies
shouldn't be war but rather permitting weapons inspectors to
aggressively return to Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   The Nazi years created a deep and permanent wariness in Germany
about the consequences of going to war. Schroeder never met his
father, who died serving in the army. During the Cold War, West
Germany, like Japan, drew the lesson that it should avoid great-power
politics and concentrate on economics. In Germany, the memory of
World War II and the economic and moral destruction of the country
also long tainted the idea of any military action apart from defense.</TE>
<TE>   However, since unification in 1990, American administrations have
encouraged Germany to shed its status as economic giant/political
dwarf. Schroeder, by taking the lead in Europe against joining a U.S.
war against Iraq, is doing just that.</TE>
<TE>   German leadership in Europe does not have to be seen just as
opposition to the United States. Schroeder is right to fear that an
attack on Saddam Hussein would jeopardize the war on terrorism by
tearing apart the NATO alliance. Instead of becoming angry at
Schroeder, the Bush administration should try harder to hear his
words of caution.</TE>

<LD>Despite the moaning from some prestige schools, the Bush
administration's proposal to change the federal Blue Ribbon Schools
awards is both sound and fair. California could bring more sense and
sensibility to its own Distinguished Schools program by following
suit.</LD>
<LD>   The two wildly popular prizes have become a sort of Academy Award
for elite campuses, with administrators and parent volunteers
spending hundreds of hours on the complicated applications. Parents
love it when their kids' schools win. Real estate agents mention
victorious schools to close deals.</LD>
<LD>   It's another question whether the awards mean that those schools
do the best teaching. Some fine schools can't be bothered with the
time-consuming applications. Many poor inner-city schools lack a
cadre of parents with the time and the experience to tackle the
application process.</LD>
<TE>   The criteria for winning change with the educational breezes, too.
For California's program, it went from being about tests to
technology and parent involvement, with several switches in between.</TE>
<TE>   The state recently delivered a blow to inner-city schools by
saying that no school could have Distinguished status if it came out
below average on the Academic Performance Index, no matter how far it
had risen already. Even the API program rewards struggling campuses
that improve scores.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. Secretary of Education Rod Paige proposes switching the Blue
Ribbon award's emphasis away from programs and parent involvement at
schools and toward standardized test scores.</TE>
<TE>   States could nominate schools with scores in the top 10%, or
schools with many disadvantaged students that had markedly increased
their scores. Half the nominees would have to come from the latter
category. The simpler, more objective criteria make for a shorter,
lower-hassle application.</TE>
<TE>   This proposal makes all kinds of sense. Instead of rewarding an
interdisciplinary curriculum that sounds nice but that might or might
not help students learn, the new Blue Ribbons would reward results.
The Education Department would examine programs at those schools to
see what they had in common so other schools might learn from their
example.</TE>
<TE>   Many winning schools complain that the Blue Ribbon would lose its
cachet if lower-scoring schools without elite programs started
winning. They point out, correctly, that there's more to good
education than test scores.</TE>
<TE>   It's true that new rules would widen the pool of schools that
could shine publicly. But states still would be encouraged to
consider educational innovation in nominations--as long as those
schools also achieve.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>"Term Limits Hinder Legislative Diligence" (Sept. 2) points to the
usefulness of looking for a new way to increase the effectiveness of
our state legislators. There has been no dialogue about increasing
the size of the Legislature. Not only would a larger Legislature mean
less of a burden on any one legislator, but the influence of special
interests would be tempered, perhaps dramatically, without our
worrying whether legislators are in compliance with campaign and
financial disclosure reforms. Some will point to the size of the
Capitol and ask how a larger Legislature would be possible.
Californians in Silicon Valley and along the digital coast can give a
compelling answer.</LD>

<TE>   Your article discussed, among other things, the "gut and amend"
tactic used by many of our state legislators to circumvent
unfavorable votes by legislative committees or on the floor. Even
with no legislative experience whatsoever, I know that the California
Legislature's Joint Rule 9 prohibits such dishonest maneuvers.</TE>
<TE>   The excuse that inexperience because of term limitations is to
blame for rule violations didn't happen to come from a legislator due
to be ousted by those limitations, did it? Maybe it's time for
another constitutional amendment invalidating statutes passed when
gross violations of legislative rules have enabled the passage.</TE>

<LD>"Charter School Students Scoring Below Their Public Peers, Study

difference in funding between these innovative public schools of
choice and the traditional public schools. In California our charter
schools struggle along with about 60% of the per-student funding of
our traditional public schools. This helps to put into context both
the slightly lower test scores in charter schools as well as the
comment about charter schools' higher rate of failure for financial
reasons.</LD>

<HD>Insider Case: Allegations Within the Allegations</HD>
<DH></DH>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Re "What a Difference a Few Dots Make in Investigations," Commentary,
Sept. 3: A funny thing happened on Victor Gold's way to the article
that he was writing about Martha Stewart's insider-trading troubles.
Gold decided to take a detour in order to make some loosely connected
allegations that in the 1950s Robert Kennedy, in his role as counsel
on the congressional rackets committee, pursued the Teamsters' Jimmy
Hoffa but went easy on UAW President Walter Reuther because Reuther
was a Kennedy political supporter.</LD>
<LD>   The rackets committee did investigate Reuther, the UAW and the UAW
strike against the Kohler plumbing supply company, and Reuther did
testify before it in March 1958. The committee, however, did not
uncover anything that wasn't part of the National Labor Relations
Board's investigation already. The NLRB, according to Arthur
Schlesinger Jr., found the Kohler company guilty of unfair labor
practices.</LD>
<TE>   Why does Gold veer off the road to put a little spin on this old
story? Well, let's connect our own dots: Gold was Sen. Barry
Goldwater's press secretary (some years after the UAW investigation).
Goldwater, who once described Reuther as the "leader of Soviet
America, more dangerous than Sputnik," had insisted that the
committee investigate Reuther, even though Kennedy thought it
unnecessary. In the end, Goldwater is reported to have said to
Kennedy: "You were right. We never should have gotten into this
matter."</TE>
<TE>   Steven E. Clark</TE>
<TE>   Pasadena</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   "Fill in the dots, complete the picture," Gold cryptically
advises, and then the insidious, evil hand of the GOP will come into
focus not only as Stewart's tormentor but even as the real culprit in
the insider trading scheme that has enveloped her. Eliot Ness style,
he puts forth Public Enemy "dot" No. 1: "When a public official [FDA
official Richard Pazdur] ... provides information to a private
company [Bristol-Myers] before that information is made public, what
responsibility does the public official have for the stock-market
scandal that follows?"</TE>
<TE>   Are we now going to say that individuals who commit crimes may be
exculpated if information obtained from a government official made
their commission personally irresistible? Perhaps Stewart is
untouchable, but this defense is a laugher.</TE>

<LD>Re "Craving That 9-Month Break," Voices, Aug. 31: As summer was
winding down to the beginning of a new school year, my thoughts were
of worry and excitement. I was about to move to another city, six
hours away from my home in San Jose. Moving to a place where I would
not know anyone was a little intimidating. On the other hand, I was
excited to go off to college, to play soccer and to meet new people.</LD>
<LD>   I am a freshman at Cal State Northridge, and my summer flew by. I
dreaded the day that I would have to drive away from my family and
closest friends to an unfamiliar place. Now, after living in
Northridge for one month, I have made wonderful friends, mostly from
soccer, but outside of soccer as well. And now that I look back,
school started at just the right time. It's funny how different
people's perspectives can be; from college student to fourth-grader
to teacher, school is going to start whether we are ready or not.</LD>

protection clause.</LD>

free speech in that its intent and effect is to deny protection to

<HD>Give Cheney a Break: Iraq Presents a Real Problem</HD>
<DH></DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Robert Scheer goes too far with his scandal-mongering insinuations in
"Dick Cheney's Nightmare of Peace" (Commentary, Sept. 3). He
insinuates that Cheney sold his shares of Halliburton to cash out
"after sending Halliburton down the road to possible bankruptcy."
Cheney was forced to sell his shares before he could accept public
office as the vice president. The "possible bankruptcy" Scheer refers
to concerns a $600-million liability over the next 15 years for
worker asbestos injuries. Halliburton's current assets are more than
$5 billion.</LD>
<LD>   Scheer criminalizes Cheney for accounting practices at Halliburton
and insinuates that he must be guilty because the SEC is
investigating and a "conservative" organization called Judicial Watch
charged that "Cheney broke the law." The issue in question is an
accounting change made during Cheney's watch that recorded
uncollected debts as revenue, a practice used throughout the Fortune
500.</LD>
<TE>   What is really appalling, however, is Scheer's underlying argument
that Cheney and the administration want to go to war with Iraq merely
to divert attention from the recession in America. The administration
is facing a difficult problem in dealing with Iraq, and while a
preemptive strike against Saddam Hussein might not be in our best
interest, accusing the White House of risking war to avoid attention
is slanderous. I am tired of people like Scheer disparaging the vice
president without offering any insight into the problems facing our
country or how to deal with them.</TE>

<TE>   I couldn't disagree with Scheer more, and I'm on the left. We
don't have the time or money to investigate Cheney's (perhaps)
illegal moves as CEO of Halliburton. We spent it investigating
President Clinton, driving the focus away from the real
issues--terrorists both inside and outside of the boardroom.</TE>
<TE>   We have real issues to fight. Let Ken Lay and Cheney off; they
probably deserved the money.</TE>

sudden focus on a war with Iraq has driven all talk of Harken and
Halliburton from the papers?</TE>

<TE>   Re "U.S. Looking at Use of 'Coercive Inspections,' " Sept. 4: So
now "coercive inspections" has become the newest euphemism to justify
the preemptive strike that will initiate a "regime change" in Iraq.
Better to call it the Big Bad Wolf plan. Armed to the teeth, we knock
on Hussein's door, knowing full well he'd never be crazy enough to
let us in, and then we huff and puff and blow his house down. Great
idea, unless the House of Iraq is made of bricks.</TE>

<TE>   This Vietnam combat veteran wants you and others who take these
polls with trick questions to take a real poll about a war with Iraq
("Public Still Backs Military Move on Iraq," Sept. 2).</TE>
<TE>   Like maybe ask 18-to-25-year-olds: Will you enlist and go fight?
Are you ready for the draft to be activated? Then ask all those you
asked about supporting a war if they will also enlist if they are of
age. Once you start asking the right questions about another dirty
little war, then I guarantee you the "support" will be overwhelmingly
against.</TE>

<HD>Recreational Fishermen Don't Threaten Reserves</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Re "Conserve Now, Fish Later," editorial, Aug. 31: I agree that
closing off areas to commercial fishermen will help the populations
of both commercially important and noncommercially important fish
(referred to as "bycatch") as well as protect the areas from
potentially destructive commercial fishing practices, but closing
these areas to recreational fishermen is misguided and
counterproductive to ensuring that these areas stay protected.</LD>
<LD>   Recreational fishermen target select species, use fishing
procedures that do not catch large numbers of fish indiscriminately,
practice catch and release, and aid fishery biologists by
volunteering in tagging programs to track fish populations. To my
knowledge, no species of ocean fish or ocean mammal is endangered
because of recreational fishing pressure; unfortunately, the same
cannot be said regarding commercial fishing practices.</LD>
<LD>   Excluding recreational fishermen from these areas will eliminate a
large group that favors the intent of the reserves and will prevent
them from aiding in the enforcement of rules for these zones, as
recreational fishermen will quickly report any commercial or private
violation or damage in the reserves.</LD>
<TE>   Applying the same rules to commercial and recreational fishermen
for these reserves is equivalent to saying that hikers and commercial
logging should be treated the same when it comes to their use of our
national forests.</TE>

<HD>Another Hate Beating Reported</HD>
<DH></DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A third man was attacked early Monday morning near the spot where a
33-year-old actor and a friend were beaten with a baseball bat and a
metal pipe, Los Angeles County Sheriff's said Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   Both incidents are being investigated as hate crimes, officials
said.</LD>
<LD>   Officials said the third victim made his report Thursday, after
learning of the first attack, which left Treve Broudy in critical
condition.</LD>
<TE>   "It was the same night. The same street. The same exact MO," said
Deputy Donald M. Mueller of the West Hollywood Sheriff's Station.</TE>
<TE>   The third victim, whose name was not released, was walking near
Hilldale Avenue and Cynthia Street about 1:30 a.m. when a car pulled
up and two men jumped out, Mueller said.</TE>
<TE>   The 35-year-old West Hollywood resident was struck in the back of
the head before he could escape and run toward busy Santa Monica
Boulevard. His assailants chased him and hit him again before they
fled. He suffered large bruises on the back of his head, but did not
seek medical help, Mueller said.</TE>
<TE>   The third victim made the report Thursday as officials held a news
conference to release a composite sketch of one of three men alleged
to have participated in the beating of Broudy and a friend.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, outraged family members and a local business offered a
reward of $35,000 for information leading to arrests in the beating
of Broudy. And West Hollywood community officials announced unity
marches tonight and Saturday night in response to the attacks.</TE>
<TE>   Broudy's condition  was upgraded to serious at Cedars-Sinai
Medical Center, four days after he and a friend were assaulted in the
8900 block of Cynthia about 12:20 a.m.</TE>
<TE>   At a news conference Thursday, Sheriff Lee Baca called that crime
an outrage and said the victims appeared to have been targeted
because they were believed to be gay.</TE>
<TE>   Sheriff's officials said that patrol deputies were actively
searching for a 1987 or 1988 light brown or faded red, four-door
Nissan.</TE>
<TE>   The vehicle, authorities said, is described as having tinted rear
windows and may have California license plates with the partial
numbers 3SDO or 3SOU.</TE>
<TE>   Sheriff's Det. John Kniest said the department was investigating
the incident as a hate crime because of the location and timing of
the attack, which took place just after Broudy and his friend had
embraced.</TE>
<TE>   Kniest said other evidence also pointed toward a hate crime, but
he declined to release details. Mueller said the second attack was
also being investigated as a hate crime.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to the beating inflicted on Broudy, the attackers
smashed two windows on Edward Lett's car and hit him on the arm as he
sped away, Capt. Lynda Castro said.</TE>
<TE>   Two witnesses driving by saw Broudy struck with a metal pipe and
kicked. They flashed their lights and the attackers fled, sheriff's
officials said.</TE>
<TE>   "We want to show that the business owners and the residents--we're
just not going to put up with this," said David Cooley, owner of the
Abbey, a West Hollywood restaurant that put up $10,000 of the reward.</TE>
<TE>   City officials plan to distribute copies of the sketch in West
Hollywood bars this weekend.</TE>
<TE>   Steve Martin, mayor pro tem of West Hollywood, said the attack
left his community rattled and determined to do more to combat
discrimination against homosexuals.</TE>
<TE>   "It just really brings home the reality of some of the mindless
hatred that hangs over our lives," said Martin, who is gay. .</TE>

<HD>Santa Ana Tavern Loses Its License</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>VIVIAN LETRAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>State authorities revoked the liquor license of a Santa Ana tavern
Thursday, saying bar employees were selling cocaine and that one of
the owners hid her involvement in the establishment.</LD>
<LD>   The Half Crown Bar, 1238 E. Edinger Ave., was the target of a
sting operation two years ago by Santa Ana police who arrested
employees and patrons on suspicion of selling and possessing cocaine,
said Carl DeWing, a spokesman for the state Department of Alcoholic
Beverage Control.</LD>
<LD>   Authorities said they also learned that one of the bar's owners,
Rumalda Ortiz, hid her involvement and interest in the business.
Ortiz had unspecified problems with a liquor license she held in the
1980s and is no longer qualified to hold a license, DeWing said.</LD>
<TE>   An investigation, however, established that Ortiz was the manager
of the Half Crown Bar and had invested $35,000 in the business,
DeWing said. The state requires that all partners be identified
before a license is issued.</TE>
<TE>   Employees at the tavern said the punishment seemed unfair.</TE>
<TE>   "It's just another injustice in the system," said Jesse Medina,
who has worked at the bar since it opened four years ago. "The
incident where they arrested some of the patrons with narcotics had
nothing to do with the bar, and now they're punishing the bar."</TE>

<LD>A suspected drug dealer was killed by undercover officers Thursday
night in a Boyle Heights pizzeria parking lot after he drove his car
into vehicles occupied by agents, authorities said.</LD>
<LD>   The shooting occurred at about 8 p.m. in the 400 block of North
Cummings Street near a Shakey's Pizza, said Jose Martinez, a Drug
Enforcement Administration spokesman.</LD>
<LD>   Undercover agents from the DEA and the Los Angeles Police
Department had just purchased half a kilo of cocaine from the man and
were trying to arrest him when he gunned his car into a van and
surveillance vehicle, Martinez said.</LD>
<TE>   One officer fired, hitting the man, whose name was not released.</TE>
<TE>   Two undercover officers were hospitalized as a precautionary
measure. Their injuries were not considered life-threatening.</TE>

<LD>A 21-year-old man surrendered Thursday to begin serving a 180-day
jail term for stealing a 1953 National League championship ring that
once belonged to baseball legend Jackie Robinson.</LD>
<LD>   Miguel Rodriguez, 21, surrendered in Los Angeles Superior Court
Judge Rand S. Rubin's courtroom. Rodriguez had pleaded last month to
grand theft of personal property and receiving stolen property,
prosecutors said.</LD>
<LD>   Rodriguez sold the ring, valued at $12,000, to a pawnbroker for
$100. He notified police in April; Rodriguez was arrested soon
afterward. The ring was returned to Robinson's brother-in-law,
Charles Ray Isum, who got it from his sister, who was Robinson's
widow.</LD>

<HD>2nd Suspect Charged in Theft of Seniors' Checks</HD>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The second of three suspects wanted in an alleged scam that involved
stealing blank checks from residents of the Los Angeles Jewish Home
for the Aging in Reseda and cashing them for thousands of dollars has
been arrested, police said Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   John Coley Hatcher, 34, was arrested Aug. 30 near his Panorama
City home, authorities said. He pleaded not guilty Tuesday to nine
counts of forgery and was being held at Men's Central Jail in lieu of
$1.2-million bail.</LD>
<LD>   Last month, Agustina Figueroa, a nurse's aide at the home, pleaded
no contest to burglary and was sentenced to two years in state
prison, said Deputy. Dist. Atty. William J. Ryder. A judge also
ordered the 24-year-old North Hollywood resident to pay $11,890 in
restitution.</LD>
<TE>   An arrest warrant has been issued for the third suspect,
Francinete Nunez, 32, of Sylmar. She faces 13 counts of forgery.</TE>
<TE>   LAPD Det. Sharon Horan said Figueroa, who worked the night shift,
was believed to have stolen checks from residents, all in their 80s
and 90s, while they slept. She also is alleged to have copied their
signatures from medical charts, Horan said. Figueroa is alleged to
have given the blank checks to Nunez in return for money. Between
March and August, Horan said, Nunez and Hatcher cashed several checks
totaling more than $20,000.</TE>
<TE>   Nunez and Hatcher are alleged to have tried to open a checking
account with a $10,000 check that authorities said was stolen from a
resident at the home. Other residents of the home have claimed to
have noticed unauthorized checks--ranging from $100 to
$1,000--written on their accounts, authorities said.</TE>
<TE>   "It is really a sad case," Horan said. "Some of the victims were
actually sleeping with their purses."</TE>

<HD>State Crime Rate Grew by 3.7% in 2001, Reversing Long Trend</HD>
<DH>Report: Homicides rose in the Southland, up 7% in L.A.
County, 17.7% in Riverside County and 12.5% in Orange County.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RAY F. HERNDON and ANDREW BLANKSTEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>California's crime rate increased 3.7% last year, spurred primarily
by increases in homicides, robberies and vehicle thefts, the state
attorney general's office reported Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   In a statement accompanying the annual report, Atty. Gen. Bill
Lockyer described the statistics as indicative of a reversal in the
long trend of "impressive annual decreases" in crime.</LD>
<LD>   Among violent crimes, the attorney general's report said, the
greatest increase was in the state's homicide rate, with statistics
showing that Los Angeles, Riverside and Orange counties accounted for
70% of the increase in slayings.</LD>
<TE>   But Jim Amormino, a spokesman for the Orange County Sheriff's
Department, cautioned against reading too much into statistics based
on relatively small numbers. "Sometimes statistics are deceiving," he
said. "I don't think we're slipping back--the crime rate in Orange
County is so low that, if you get just a couple more crimes, you have
a 40% increase."</TE>
<TE>   After declining steadily from 1994 through 1999, the number of
homicides reversed direction in 2000 and accelerated last year. The
number rose 6.1%, from 2,074 to 2,201.</TE>
<TE>   The number of homicides in Los Angeles County increased 7%, from
1,000 to 1,070. But Riverside County reported 17.7% more killings,
and Orange County had 12.5% more. In certain cities, the increases in
the number of homicides were even greater. Santa Ana, for example,
had a 41% increase in slayings, from 17 to 24.</TE>
<TE>   For the purposes of crime reporting, California ranks six crimes
as the most serious and uses them to compute the state's overall
crime rate. They are homicide, forcible rape, robbery, aggravated
assault, burglary and motor vehicle theft. Separately, the state
computes a violent crime rate using the first four, and a property
crime rate with the remaining two.</TE>
<TE>   The violent crime rate decreased 0.8%, but a surge in property
crimes, particularly the 11.1% increase in the number of vehicle
thefts, drove up the overall state crime rate. Violent crime declined
in Los Angeles and Orange counties last year, despite increases in
the number of homicides and robberies.</TE>
<TE>   But when factoring in the increases in property crimes, Los
Angeles saw a 1.7% growth in total crime, and Orange County's rate
jumped 5.5%.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the rise in crime, Lockyer said that crime overall
"remains at ... levels last seen in the 1960s."</TE>
<TE>   "Determined efforts are being made to understand why the enormous
decline in crime has leveled off and to put into practice policies
and procedures which will further the decreases in crime," Lockyer
said.</TE>

<HD>Protest Has Opened Old Cultural Rift</HD>
<DH>Dispute: Teacher's march against U.S. killing of Afghan
civilians angers some in small town.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RONE TEMPEST</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WILLITS, Calif.</DL>
<LD>Outraged by a misguided U.S. military attack on a civilian wedding
party in Afghanistan, a young schoolteacher staged a one-man protest
on Main Street during Willits' annual July 4 Frontier Days parade.</LD>
<LD>   The singular act of dissent did not sit well with some in the
crowd. Hecklers taunted 28-year-old Anthony Melville, some offering
him free passage to Kabul for his trouble.</LD>
<LD>   One stocky woman bolted from the sidelines and tussled with
Melville as she tried to grab his sign. A man driving a tractor in
the parade attempted to herd the protester off the street.</LD>
<TE>   As cultural clashes go, it was a minor dust-up. No complaints were
filed with police. The sign-grabber eventually offered Melville an
apology.</TE>
<TE>   Yet the incident has left a bitter taste. The town still dwells on
it in the letters columns of the local newspaper and at the tables of
the Willits Cafe, where the town elders hold court.</TE>
<TE>   Old fault lines have been reopened between traditional ranching
and logging families, and the countercultural settlers who arrived
during the late 1960s and early '70s.</TE>
<TE>   Like many American towns and cities caught in the heightened
sensitivity after Sept. 11, Willits finds itself struggling over what
constitutes patriotism and appropriate expression of dissent a year
after the terrorist attacks.</TE>
<TE>   Said Alan Schlosser, legal director for the American Civil
Liberties Union in Northern California: "I think in the post-9/11
period, and now that we are moving into a potential war with Iraq,
there is considerably more controversy and polarization. This comes
at a time when it is most important that there be a robust free
speech."</TE>
<TE>   Schlosser said the ACLU has followed several reports, notably on
university campuses, involving challenges to free speech.</TE>
<TE>   Maria Brook, a 54-year-old social activist and retired midwife in
Willits, explains it this way: "I don't think it would have even been
an issue before Sept. 11. In previous July 4 parades, we've had
no-nukes people pulling rainbow-themed floats and even a giant
pro-marijuana truck. But, like people all over America, many here
felt sucker-punched and confused by 9/11. The media really played up
the jingoistic elements."</TE>
<TE>   Bob Hagan, a retired military communications specialist, thinks
Janet Lively, the 36-year-old mother of two who attempted to grab
Melville's sign, "should have been given a medal."</TE>
<TE>   "I represent the silent majority," said Hagan, 55, interviewed as
he sat on a picnic bench under towering redwoods at Brooktrails golf
course. "What happened on July 4 is very representative of the
ideological differences that exist here. I believe that 9/11 has
finally lowered the tolerance level of people for this kind of
behavior."</TE>
<TE>   The main target of Hagan's wrath, expressed in newspaper letters
and public statements, is Lanny Cotler, a local screenwriter and
political activist. Cotler, 61, a veteran of the 1964 free speech
movement as a student at UC Berkeley, sprang to Melville's aid during
the parade and walked alongside the protester, carrying an American
flag emblazoned with a peace symbol.</TE>
<TE>   Letters to the Editor</TE>
<TE>   "I hope any red-blooded American would have done the same thing,"
said Cotler, who moved to Willits from Los Angeles in 1984. After the
incident, Cotler, who was born on the Fourth of July, penned an
impassioned defense of dissent that was published in the Willits
News.</TE>
<TE>   Cotler wrote that when he saw Melville, carrying his large
black-and-white sign, he regarded the protest as an act of personal
courage. The sign referred to a July 1 incident in which an American
warplane struck a wedding party in a central Afghanistan village,
killing 48 people, all but three of whom were women and children.</TE>
<TE>   "I said to my daughter," Cotler wrote, "there goes a man with a
morality-based grievance and the courage to express it peacefully in
public."</TE>
<TE>   Cotler's editorial page article outraged Hagan and others in the
community of 5,000, divided about equally between old-timers and new
settlers.</TE>
<TE>   "Your form of social terrorism is wearing pretty thin in this town
and across the nation," Hagan responded in a July 31 letter to the
editor. "Do us all a favor and take me up on a free one-way ride to
the airport."</TE>
<TE>   Hagan, who moved here seven years ago, said his newspaper
broadside appeared to touch a nerve among fellow Willits
conservatives, some of whom are newcomers like him.</TE>
<TE>   "My right hand is still sore from all the people shaking it," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   The impact of the war was brought home in January when a Willits
Marine was killed in a helicopter crash near Kabul.</TE>
<TE>   Willits High School graduate Dwight Morgan, 24, whose wife and two
small children live here, was one of two Marines killed when a CH-53E
Super Stallion went down.</TE>
<TE>   Still, Hagan's sentiments were not universally embraced. His
letter prompted a wave of responses defending Cotler, including one
letter, notable for its own free-speech implications, attacking the
newspaper for publishing Hagan's views.</TE>
<TE>   "I was disappointed in the Willits News for choosing to print Bob
Hagan's letter, consisting of a mean-spirited, personal attack on Mr.
Cotler," said Janice Gendreau in a letter published Aug. 14.</TE>
<TE>   Willits presents a dissonant culture of loggers, cattle ranchers,
vegans, environmental activists, marijuana growers and middle-class
retirees.</TE>
<TE>   A major exhibit at the Mendocino County Museum in town is a hippie
van, complete with bells, Oriental carpets and dangling locks of
hair.</TE>
<TE>   The new settlers of the '60s and '70s, whom the locals knew as
"hippies" and "back-to-the-landers," brought with them radical
politics that clashed with the area's entrenched Republicanism.</TE>
<TE>   The newcomers, in turn, referred to the longtime residents as
"hicks" and "rednecks." The newcomers hung out at the organic
Mariposa Market. Marijuana emerged as the area's main cash crop.</TE>
<TE>   The old-timers dug in at Al's Redwood Bar &amp; Grill. They celebrated
their heritage in the traditional July 4 parade and the annual
Frontier Days rodeo.</TE>
<TE>   Some of the tensions eased as the two cultures raised children and
mothers got to know each other through the school system. There was
some intermarriage.</TE>
<TE>   But to this day, the groups maintain a state of aloof coexistence
that flares into occasional conflict, as it did at the parade.</TE>
<TE>   Willits Mayor Bruce Burton, a lumber mill owner and lifetime
resident who carefully walks the cultural divide, said he is
"surprised the [Melville controversy] has extended as long as it has.
I'm not sure it is over yet."</TE>
<TE>   Burton, who was a student at UC Berkeley's School of Forestry in
the late 1960s, sees the simmering debate as a reflection of
"America's talk-radio form of expression."</TE>
<TE>   His idea for calming the waters is to ask Cotler, who worked in
Vietnam as a civilian during the war there, to carry a flag with the
American Legion in next year's July 4 parade.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it would be beneficial to the community if he would
demonstrate both sides of patriotism," Burton said.</TE>
<TE>   Left largely outside the continuing fray is the original
protester.</TE>
<TE>   Melville grew up in Willits, where he attended an alternative
charter school run by his parents. A music education graduate of
Sonoma State University, Melville played in a punk rock band and
recently took a job teaching at a Native American charter school in
nearby Ukiah.</TE>
<TE>   Some Show Support</TE>
<TE>   As Melville spoke with a reporter in a Ukiah coffee shop, a young
woman recognized him and stopped at his table. "I was reading the
paper and saw what you went through," she said admiringly. "My heart
really goes out to you."</TE>
<TE>   Melville said his protest was inspired by radio host Amy Goodman,
whose counter-establishment "Democracy Now!" program is heard on
several California stations.</TE>
<TE>   "Listening to 'Democracy Now!' " Melville said, "I realized how
bad things were in our country, and that I had to get the word out on
the street. So many people out there are asleep."</TE>
<TE>   Earlier, Melville had begun a silent daily protest on Main Street
in Willits, drawing attention to causes ranging from campaign finance
reform to the plight of people held in California's prisons.</TE>
<TE>   Reports of the U.S. attack on the wedding party in Afghanistan
just days earlier brought his decision to join the July 4 parade,
which historically has been the domain of the town's more
conservative elements.</TE>
<TE>   Because of Sept. 11, this year's parade was even more oriented
toward patriotism than usual.</TE>
<TE>   Members of American Legion Post 174 served as grand marshals,
including several veterans wearing their Special Forces uniforms.</TE>
<TE>   Legionnaire Jeff Whitby played the bagpipes. Hagan followed in his
1970 Chevrolet El Camino, displaying a banner that said: "Let Freedom
Ring. God Bless America."</TE>
<TE>   Near the rear of the parade, machinist and gun dealer Clay Romero
followed his wife and other members of the 2nd Amendment Liberty
Belles female gun rights group in his pickup.</TE>
<TE>   In the truck's bed was a scale model of the Statue of Liberty
wearing a shoulder holster.</TE>
<TE>   "The most fun in the world is to put [Osama bin Laden's] picture
on an old washing machine and open fire," Romero recently told a
visitor to his machine shop. He was wearing a 9-millimeter pistol
strapped to his hip.</TE>
<TE>   Romero said Melville went too far in his one-man protest. "It's
one thing if he had been an official part of the parade. What he did
was just bad manners."</TE>
<TE>   Melville said he discussed his planned protest first with his
parents, both of whom expressed concerns about the possible
consequences of such an act, particularly in the post-Sept. 11
atmosphere.</TE>
<TE>   But Melville decided to take the risk.</TE>
<TE>   "I knew there would be a lot of pro-military presence in the
parade," Melville said. "There needed to be another voice in the
parade, other than the pro-American one."</TE>
<TE>   Lively, the woman who rushed from the crowd and tried to grab his
sign, said she acted spontaneously after she saw that police were not
going to stop Melville.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm usually pretty much peace, love and recycle," Lively said.
"But I thought what he was doing was rude. He wasn't part of the
parade. It seemed like he could do that any day of the week, but it
was the Fourth of July."</TE>
<TE>   But Lively said she shook hands with Melville after the incident.</TE>

<HD>Panel to Pick Political Reform Targets</HD>
<DH>Finances: The state agency must choose which educational or
enforcement programs go to meet a 20% cut.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CARL INGRAM</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>The watchdog agency that administers California's political reform
law began the painful process Thursday of backing away from some of
its most important functions to meet a 20% budget cut ordered by Gov.
Gray Davis.</LD>
<LD>   A relatively small agency with the enormous mission of keeping
politics clean, the Fair Political Practices Commission operates on a
budget of about $6.5 million. But it must reduce spending by $1.3
million as state government heads into a series of projected
multibillion-dollar budget shortfalls.</LD>
<LD>   Davis, who signed the state's new budget Thursday, directed
virtually every state agency last month to cut spending 20% to get a
head start on dealing with next year's gap.</LD>
<TE>   But as the political reform commission started charting its
spending cuts, members found themselves facing anguishing choices.</TE>
<TE>   For example: Should enforcement of anti-corruption laws be
restricted to the worst violators at the state level or should the
commission eliminate popular educational services that advise
candidates on how to obey the complex law and stay out of trouble?</TE>
<TE>   Gordana Swanson, a former Republican mayor of Rolling Hills, said
she favored both a robust education program and vigorous enforcement.
"If we don't have a strong enforcement procedure, we might as well
close these doors," Swanson said.</TE>
<TE>   Another proposal would shift the enforcement of financial
disclosure requirements by local public officials from the state
commission to local regulators. In some cases, though, such a change
could weaken enforcement because the local regulators would be
appointees of the elected officials suspected of wrongdoings, such as
mayors and city council members.</TE>
<TE>   "Anything you do less of, you leave a hole," warned attorney Mike
Martello of the League of California Cities.</TE>
<TE>   In deciding which violations should be the commission's highest
priorities under spending constraints, Chairwoman Karen Getman told
colleagues, "Instead of going after every single late filing, let's
go after the more egregious cases."</TE>
<TE>   The commission delayed any cuts until next month, because no
figures were available on how much money various proposals would
save. But commissioners noted that budget reductions could result in
the erosion of efforts to combat political corruption.</TE>
<TE>   "Let's not kid ourselves that we can do what we do now with 20%
less resources," Getman said.</TE>
<TE>   The state's 1975 political reform law was created by voters after
the Watergate controversy as the first of its kind in the nation.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to enforcing requirements for avoiding conflicts of
interest by state and local officials, the commission monitors
campaign spending and prosecutes violators who fail to file timely
spending reports. Violators can be severely fined.</TE>

<HD>Criticism of U.S. Felon Program Grows</HD>
<DH>Benefits: Thousands of blind, disabled and aging
Californians have lost Social Security payments after they were
tracked down for long-ago crimes.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE BERRY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A federal program designed to catch fugitives and deny them welfare
benefits has snared thousands of blind, disabled and aging
Californians. The program is coming under growing criticism from
California lawyers representing the indigent.</LD>
<LD>   The fugitive-felon program has funded a massive computer dragnet
that has saved $130 million and led to the arrest of thousands of
fugitives, law enforcement officials said.</LD>
<LD>   Most of those caught are the aged, blind and disabled who are
accused of violating probation and parole or other nonviolent crimes,
many of which are decades old.</LD>
<TE>   The program has suspended Supplemental Security Income (SSI)
benefits to nearly 7,500 blind, disabled and aged Californians since
1996, according to figures from the Social Security Administration.</TE>
<TE>   The SSI recipients also have been ordered to reimburse the agency
for some payments.</TE>
<TE>   The program compares computer databases of aid recipients with
fugitives. When Social Security turned the names and addresses of
those aged and disabled recipients over to California law enforcement
agencies, authorities apprehended 2,831 of them, according to Social
Security statistics. The statistics showed that very few of them were
murderers, rapists, robbers, kidnappers or other violent offenders.</TE>
<TE>   About 90% of those arrested in California have been violators of
probation, parole or some nonviolent crimes.</TE>
<TE>   Nationwide, 4,721 have been arrested and 45,000 recipients have
had their benefits suspended.</TE>
<TE>   Since midsummer, public defenders, court officials, legal aid
lawyers and law enforcement officers in California have been
contacted by people threatened with loss of benefits.</TE>
<TE>   Social Security officials said they will restore assistance if
recipients provide proof that warrants have been cleared, said
Mariana Gitomer, spokesman for the Social Security Administration in
California.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of taxpayers would be indignant to know that public funds
are being used as fuel to escape law enforcement," said Dick Lynch,
director of Social Security's Strategic Enforcement Division at the
agency's Office of Inspector General in Baltimore.</TE>
<TE>   "Who can argue against the benefit of taking murderers, kidnappers
and armed robbers off the street?" he said.</TE>
<TE>   Critics complain that the program has not focused on such crimes.</TE>
<TE>   "They make this sound like a law enforcement jihad, when they
actually are getting old, toothless people who are easy to find and
not fleeing from anyone," said Bruce Schweiger, a Los Angeles County
deputy public defender, who alone has answered more than 100 calls in
the last three or four weeks.</TE>
<TE>   "They are using a fire hose to extinguish a birthday candle," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   San Francisco lawyer Jane Gelfand, whose Positive Resource Center
represents people with HIV, said, "These are people who are severely
disabled with limited assets and income and frequently cut off from
family, friends or other social support."</TE>
<TE>   One of her clients, Mark Pruitt, thought that he had completed
probation for a drunken-driving conviction in Florida.</TE>
<TE>   Pruitt, 41, said he never heard anything further about the
incident until he got a notice from Social Security officials last
year saying that his SSI benefits would be suspended. He said the SSI
check provided one-third of his monthly income and helped pay for
some of the drugs he needs to combat full-blown AIDS. He has diabetes
and high blood pressure. Two hip replacement surgeries, a
degenerative shoulder condition and deteriorating joints have left
him unable to hold down jobs requiring much physical exertion, Pruitt
said.</TE>
<TE>   In San Diego County, Chief Deputy Public Defender Bob Stall said
most of the cases "are quite old, 15 years or older, and involve
nonviolent offenses, drugs, bad-check cases."</TE>
<TE>   One great-grandmother in Los Angeles lost her benefits because she
never completed probation on a 1973 drug possession conviction. Dora
Price, 65, spent six months in County Jail that year and then
violated probation early the next year, court records show.</TE>
<TE>   Price said she moved to Shreveport, La., to escape the daily,
unrelenting pressure from her drug-using friends to resume her
narcotics use.</TE>
<TE>   There, she beat her drug habit and got "a good-paying" job making
telephones for AT&amp;T. She returned to Los Angeles in the mid-1980s and
has a clean record.</TE>
<TE>   Her notice came June 17, suspending her $175 monthly SSI check.
She was left with $600 a month for rent, utilities and groceries.</TE>
<TE>   Price got good news this week. A Los Angeles County Superior Court
judge, at the request of her public defender, voided the arrest
warrant.</TE>
<TE>   Although the law is called the fugitive-felon law, former SSI
recipient Yolanda Randall, 50, never fled after she broke probation
27 years ago over a gambling-related charge in Los Angeles. Randall,
50, continued living in her home for two years after the judge
entered a bench warrant for her arrest in 1975. Court records show
that Randall's violation was failure to pay a $150 fine.</TE>
<TE>   Randall is disabled by obesity and arthritis, and has drawn SSI
since 1995, her sister, Nora Ashford, said. She was drawing $750 a
month when she got her notice on June 25. It also ordered her to
repay $18,652 in benefits she had already received.</TE>
<TE>   "I took her to three stations trying to get her into custody so we
could clear up the warrant," Ashford said. Nobody would take her. One
officer referred her to the public defender's office.</TE>
<TE>   Lynch said such violators have no one to blame but themselves.</TE>
<TE>   "You are supposed to pay for your crimes," he said. "If you have
someone in their 80s with a warrant from their 40s, couldn't you
argue they've had ample opportunity to turn themselves in?"</TE>
<TE>   One who tried that is Susan Irene Reid, who fled Los Angeles after
pleading guilty to kicking a police officer in the leg in January
1988. Reid, who was a 24-year-old psychiatric patient, said she
agreed to take medication for her illness and to remain on probation
for a year. But she ran away from the probation office on her first
visit.</TE>
<TE>   "I couldn't admit to my psychiatric problems, and I didn't want to
take medication," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Over the next 11 years, Reid was taken into custody three times--
first in Texas, where she turned herself in and spent nine days in
jail, and twice in Minnesota--on the outstanding warrant. Each time
Los Angeles authorities declined to extradite her.</TE>
<TE>   SSI helped pay her $400 monthly medication bill and qualified her
for assistance for psychiatric care to control her manic depression,
Reid said. But when the computers ground out her name July 31 for
that 1988 warrant, the agency suspended the SSI.</TE>
<TE>   Last week a judge dismissed the warrant, in part because
authorities chose not to seek extradition. Her payments will resume
when she provides a copy of the court records to Social Security.
Meanwhile, she said, she still has to battle Social Security's claim
that she owes back payments, which she estimates could be at least
$5,000.</TE>
<TE>   The fugitive-felon program grew out of a provision of the Welfare
Reform Act of 1996, which also prohibited fugitives from obtaining
food stamps. Though the U.S. Department of Agriculture moved quickly
to implement the law, the Social Security Administration did not.</TE>
<TE>   In 2000, Social Security gained access to FBI computer data on
outstanding warrants. Early last year, the agency signed its first
contracts with states to compare the names of SSI recipients to lists
of fugitives provided by police. In return, Social Security would
provide law enforcement with the addresses to which it mailed
benefits.</TE>
<TE>   In California, the program got started earlier than in most
states, Social Security officials said. The state's Department of
Social Services started providing Social Security with addresses of
SSI recipients it had matched with the Department of Justice's
outstanding warrant files by 1998, Napolski said. In Los Angeles,
authorities said they seldom bother with probation violators or
others accused of nonviolent offenses that would not carry state
prison time.</TE>
<TE>   If such violators ever appear in court, it usually is because the
outstanding warrant surfaced in a later police encounter, such as a
routine traffic stop.</TE>
<TE>   Only the more serious violators--those accused of murder, rape or
other crimes that would put them in a state prison--prompt law
enforcement to go to the expense of a search and extradition effort,
prosecutors and law enforcement officials said.</TE>
<TE>   "If it's a probation violation, it usually means the individual
has not been sentenced to state prison," said John Paul Bernardi,
director of the Los Angeles County district attorney's Support
Operations Bureau.</TE>
<TE>   "When it comes to felonies, you still have to analyze how serious
the offense is, how dangerous they are, its deterrence role, and then
you have to decide whether it's a wise allocation of resources."</TE>
<TE>   If a trial will be required, the case may not be provable if
witnesses are no longer available or evidence is missing, he said.</TE>
<TE>   LAPD Capt. James Miller, area commander of the 77th Street
Station, said that even serious larceny cases do not always warrant
extradition.</TE>
<TE>   He cited a mid-1980s case in which prosecutors decided not to
extradite a man who had fled to the East Coast to escape charges of
grand larceny and receiving stolen property.</TE>
<TE>   When asked about circumstances similar to Randall's
gambling-related probation violation, Miller said, "Somebody who has
gone for 25 years without being picked up, she's obviously changed
her life, which is the whole purpose of probation."</TE>
<TE>   Schweiger, the Los Angeles deputy public defender, doesn't
advocate abandoning the fugitive-felon program. It just needs to be
amended, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "The problem is that you have these two huge bureaucracies that
... don't take the human costs into account," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "They are doing nothing but matching names and addresses with
checks without giving thought to the actual consequences," he said.</TE>

<LD>Light rain and cooler temperatures improved the prospects for
firefighters battling major blazes in the Leona Valley and the San
Gabriel Mountains on Thursday, and officials predicted that the Leona
fire would soon be fully controlled.</LD>
<LD>   "We feel confident we've got this fire," said Henry Rodriguez, a
Los Angeles County fire captain at the Leona blaze, which was 94%
contained Thursday night after charring about 5,100 acres.</LD>
<LD>   Officials at the 17,000-acre blaze in the mountains north of Azusa
were more cautious.</LD>
<TE>   "I'd say we're moderately optimistic, which is a lot more
optimistic than we were Monday," said Ed Gililland, a fire
information officer with the U.S. Forest Service. "But it's really
rugged country, and it's hard to get men and equipment in there."</TE>
<TE>   By midafternoon Thursday, sprinkles were falling on both fires and
temperatures were as much as 20 degrees cooler than they had been
earlier this week, when thermometers topped 100 degrees.</TE>
<TE>   "Rain, by itself, probably won't put out a fire," said Capt. Brian
Jordan of the Los Angeles County Fire Department. "But rain raises
the humidity, and that cuts down on the flare-ups. And the cooler
temperatures are a blessing for the firefighters. It makes it much
easier for them to do their work."</TE>
<TE>   The fires had destroyed at least 78 buildings, including a
64-year-old fire lookout tower atop South Mt. Hawkins, an old ranger
station at Coldbrook, at least four year-round homes in the Leona
Valley and more than a dozen vacation cabins near Crystal Lake. But
no other structures were threatened, and neither blaze appeared to be
expanding much by Thursday afternoon.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the hundreds of residents who had fled the Leona Valley
were back home.</TE>
<TE>   Kaia Thomson, owner of the Cowhorse Ranch in Leona Valley, said
she rode a horse out to survey the damage.</TE>
<TE>   "It looked a lot different than I remember it," she said.
"Everything is reduced to black and blacker. And you can still feel
the heat radiating from the earth where it burned."</TE>
<TE>   She said she saw signs of life: rabbits, lizards and some deer
tracks through the ashes.</TE>
<TE>   Gililland said there was still a long battle ahead in the steep
mountain country 15 miles north of Azusa. The fire there was only 15%
contained.</TE>

<HD>First-Day Language Tests Put Kids Into the Right Classes</HD>
<DH></DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>

<LD>The first day of school is usually one for picking desks, making
friends and boasting of summer exploits. For more than 100 newcomers
to the multiethnic Garden Grove Unified School District, however,
Thursday began with tests.</LD>
<LD>   The placement tests, measuring fluency in English, are an annual
ritual in the district and others across the state that find
themselves with ever more diverse student bodies.</LD>
<LD>   By law, students from homes where a language other than English is
spoken must be tested. The results help place them in an appropriate
classroom, either with help in learning English or in mainstream
classes if they are fluent.</LD>
<TE>   It's a task that has grown complex over the years. In Garden Grove
schools alone, more than 40 languages are spoken. Of those students
still learning English--roughly half the district's 50,000
pupils--about two-thirds speak Spanish, a quarter speak Vietnamese
and the rest speak languages such as Korean, Punjabi, Urdu and
French.</TE>
<TE>   Determining what language the children speak isn't always simple.
A few years ago, two Korean girls were waiting to be tested, one
district worker said. A Korean translator was called in, but after a
few minutes, the translator determined the girls didn't speak Korean;
they'd grown up in El Salvador and spoke only Spanish.</TE>
<TE>   "It is an education for us," said Jay Heck, supervisor of the
Garden Grove district's assessment and registration center next to
Dr. A.J. Cook Elementary School.</TE>
<TE>   Early Thursday, a line snaked around the center's portable
buildings on Woodbury Road, with parents clutching registration
papers, and children stifling yawns.</TE>
<TE>   Josefina Perez, 24, was one of the first in line, accompanied by
daughters Itzel, 8 and Itzayana, 6. The family arrived from Mexico
just a few weeks ago, and the girls speak no English.</TE>
<TE>   "That's what worries me the most," Perez said in Spanish.</TE>
<TE>   Her daughters weren't concerned, though. "I'm really excited,"
Itzel said. "I'm going to go to school and learn English."</TE>
<TE>   The center opened 14 years ago in a single room at the Cook
campus. Garden Grove education officials, like others in surrounding
towns, saw the coming wave of immigrant families settling in Orange
County. Neighboring Santa Ana Unified School District opened a
similar center a year earlier.</TE>
<TE>   Such centers make it more efficient to process newcomers,
officials said. Parents can be told of school requirements and
students can be tested more consistently. Some centers even offer
immunization shots.</TE>
<TE>   "This is really nice," said Scott Amrini, 32, waiting in line with
stepdaughter Dalouny, 7. "I don't have to go to my doctor for the
shots. She's really excited and can't wait to go to school."</TE>
<TE>   Dalouny arrived from Laos in March with Amrini's new wife. The
mother is still learning English herself, so Amrini took the day off
to register their daughter.</TE>
<TE>   Farther down the line, Adrianna Cortez, 29, admonished her
restless son, Renee, 5, who kept wandering off and using handrails as
a jungle gym. Cortez is bilingual in Spanish and English. Her son,
the youngest of four, speaks only English, although he understands
Spanish.</TE>
<TE>   Because of a quirk in the law, even those fluent in English still
must be tested if they are exposed to a different language at home.</TE>
<TE>   "It is a reality of the times,'' said Cortez, surveying the
diverse group of families in the line.</TE>
<TE>   Inside the buildings, the center's staff of almost 40 was busy
handling papers and testing the children. Although the district
registers most of its new students earlier in the summer, many
parents show up on the first day of school.</TE>
<TE>   On less busy days, the center also serves as a bridge between
non-English-speaking parents and the district. The staff translates
mailers into several languages and interprets during meetings.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier this year, during the kidnapping and murder case of
Samantha Runnion, who was a student in the district, the center
mailed letters to calm concerned parents.</TE>
<TE>   "The melting pot is getting bigger," said Roberta Watkins, the
center's administrative secretary. "I am just so proud of this
place."</TE>

<HD>Sheldon H. Harris, 74; Historian Detailed Japan's Germ
Warfare</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>REBECCA TROUNSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Sheldon H. Harris, a Cal State Northridge historian whose
groundbreaking work helped establish that Japan conducted biological
warfare experiments on Chinese civilians and military prisoners
during World War II, has died. He was 74.</LD>
<LD>   Harris died of a blood infection Aug. 31 at UCLA Medical Center,
but lived long enough to experience a moment of particular
gratification, his son, David, said.</LD>
<LD>   Four days before Harris' death, a Japanese court ended decades of
official denials and acknowledged, for the first time, that Japan had
used germ warfare in occupied China in the 1930s and '40s. Ruling in
a lawsuit brought by victims, the court acknowledged the existence of
the program but rejected the plaintiffs' demands for compensation,
saying the issue was covered under postwar treaties.</LD>
<TE>   David Harris said his father, who did interviews on the court's
decision from his hospital bed, was gratified by the ruling. "It's
really rather remarkable that this judgment came down with such
clarity just before he died," Harris said. "It was a pretty nice
crowning achievement."</TE>
<TE>   In 1994, Sheldon Harris published "Factories of Death: Japanese
Biological Warfare, 1932-1945, and the American Cover-up," an account
of his findings about the Japanese germ warfare program and the role
American officials played after the war in shielding top Japanese
scientists from prosecution in exchange for their data. The United
States was then developing its own biological program.</TE>
<TE>   Based on years of research, including a dozen trips to China, the
book detailed Harris' findings that a special Japanese army unit,
known as Unit 731, carried out large scale biological warfare
experiments in northern China. Harris wrote that 10,000 to 12,000
people died in Japanese laboratories after they were infected with
anthrax, typhoid, cholera, plague and other pathogens, and that more
than 250,000 civilians were killed as a result of Japanese field
tests in the Chinese countryside.</TE>
<TE>   Harris and other scholars also found that U.S. authorities, who
had seized the Japanese researchers' archive after the war, later
returned it to Japan and kept the information it contained secret.
Harris filed hundreds of Freedom of Information Act requests to
obtain the information for the book, and was also helped secretly by
a handful of government workers, his son said. U.S. officials have
since acknowledged some American complicity in concealing the
existence of Japan's germ warfare program.</TE>
<TE>   Publication of his book brought Harris, by then retired from Cal
State Northridge, a measure of international renown, especially in
China. It also helped spur creation of a global network of activists,
headquartered in California, that has worked to preserve memories of
the wartime events and win reparations for the program's victims.</TE>
<TE>   Harris' book was "tremendously significant" in clarifying and
drawing attention to what occurred in wartime China, said Ignatius
Ding, a spokesman for the Cupertino-based network, the Alliance for
Preserving the Truth of Sino-Japanese War.</TE>
<TE>   "Without him, we would never have had this breakthrough in court,"
Ding said. "The work that he did had very tangible results."</TE>
<TE>   Following the court decision, Japanese officials announced that
the government would send a delegation to China this month to begin
excavating hundreds of abandoned chemical weapons, including bombs,
shells, and containers of mustard gas and other toxins.</TE>
<TE>   A man of diverse interests, Harris specialized in U.S. labor
history and taught a variety of courses at Cal State Northridge
before a trip to China in the early '80s dramatically changed his
focus, according to his colleagues and family members.</TE>
<TE>   While in China, Harris learned of the Japanese experiments during
the war and was asked by Chinese colleagues in an academic exchange
program if he would be willing to investigate, said Charles Macune,
chairman of the Cal State Northridge history department.</TE>
<TE>   "It changed his life," Macune said. In recent years, Harris was a
frequent speaker at human rights conferences, and on trips to China,
he was treated as a celebrity, trailed by journalists as he met with
survivors of the germ warfare program and their relatives.</TE>
<TE>   On Harris' final trip, in the spring, "people were lined up,
waiting to tell him their stories," said Martin Furmanski, a retired
medical pathologist who accompanied the historian. "He was a hero to
them."</TE>
<TE>   Harris was born in Brooklyn in 1928. He was educated at Brooklyn
College, Harvard and Columbia. In addition to his tenure at Cal State
Northridge from 1963 to 1991, he served for a time as a visiting
professor at UCLA and taught earlier in his career at the University
of Massachusetts.</TE>
<TE>   Survivors include his wife, Sheila of Granada Hills; his son, and
a daughter, Robin, both of San Francisco.</TE>
<TE>   Funeral arrangements are private, but in lieu of flowers,
contributions may be made to Doctors Without Borders, his family
said.</TE>

<HD>Gift of Giving Key Focus of Jewish Holidays</HD>
<DH>Religion: At services, worshipers will be reminded to
support those in Israel. Two-week period begins tonight with Rosh
Hashana.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>WILLIAM LOBDELL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Capacity crowds flocking to High Holy Days services in synagogues
throughout Southern California beginning today for Rosh Hashana will
hear a common message: Support your Jewish brothers and sisters in
war-torn Israel.</LD>
<LD>   Rabbis will ask worshipers, some of whom they won't see until next
year's services, to help those in the Jewish homeland in a variety of
ways. They'll be asked, for instance, to contribute to a local fund
that already has raised $18 million for victims of terrorist attacks
or to invest in Israeli bonds. Or simply to send a jar of honey to a
needy family living amid the turmoil.</LD>
<LD>   In some Orange County congregations, making a donation won't even
require wielding a pen--an act of labor forbidden in synagogues
during the holidays. On a preprinted pledge card, worshipers can turn
down a tab indicating donations from $25 to $25,000 to the Jewish
Federation Israel Emergency Campaign.</LD>
<TE>   "We want to make sure the emotion of the moment isn't lost," said
Alison Mayersohn, marketing director for the Jewish Federation of
Orange County.</TE>
<TE>   Her organization, which has collected $460,000 in recent months
specifically for Israel, had 6,000 of the cards printed and
distributed to area synagogues.</TE>
<TE>   At Kehillat Israel Reconstructionist Congregation in Pacific
Palisades, Rabbi Steven Carr Reuben will distribute materials giving
three ways to financially support Israel--including investing in
Israeli bonds.</TE>
<TE>   He said he hopes the diverse plans will bridge any political gaps
among temple members--and get 100% participation.</TE>
<TE>   "Every rabbi I know is going to remind their congregation of their
special relationship with Israel, their responsibility to Israel and
their need to stand by Israel," Reuben said.</TE>
<TE>   The Jewish holiday period begins at sundown tonight with Rosh
Hashana, the Jewish New Year, and ends Sept. 16 with the holiest day
of the Jewish calendar, Yom Kippur, the day of atonement.</TE>
<TE>   Financial support for Israel among Los Angeles County's more than
500,000 Jews has swelled quickly because of the escalating violence
in the Middle East. The Los Angeles-based "Jews in Crisis" campaign,
which began five months ago to help Israeli victims of terror,
already has raised $18 million.</TE>
<TE>   About $9 million has been spent on everything from ambulances,
bomb-sniffing dogs and bulletproof buses to cash for food, rent and
counseling.</TE>
<TE>   "This gives people a way to channel their concern and energy,"
said John Fishel, president of the Jewish Federation of Greater Los
Angeles, coordinator of the campaign.</TE>
<TE>   "This hits a responsive chord in the Jewish community and cuts
across ideological ideas. It's the human approach: Giving direct cash
contributions for people who have been victimized by terrorism."</TE>
<TE>   Some acts of charity to show solidarity are simpler.</TE>
<TE>   "Honey for the Holidays," an outreach campaign among Orange
County's estimated 90,000 Jews, puts a jar of honey--a traditional
Rosh Hashana treat that is served with apples and intended to
symbolize a sweet new year--on the table of more than 2,000 poor
Jewish families living near the Gaza Strip.</TE>
<TE>   "Israelis feel alone and isolated today," said Ira Kerem, a
representative for the Jewish Federation of Orange County who lives
in Jerusalem and is helping hand out the jars. "This is a small way
to show that they are not alone, and that people in at least one
location care enough to send them bottles of honey."</TE>
<TE>   The High Holy Days fall this year near the anniversary of the
Sept. 11 terrorist attacks in the United States, increasing the
somber nature of the observances already weighted by the continued
violence in the Middle East.</TE>
<TE>   About 125 members of the Board of Rabbis of Southern California
met last month to discuss ways to address these issues during the
upcoming holidays.</TE>
<TE>   "The rabbis were really grappling with it all, sharing texts,
bouncing ideas off each other on how to present these difficult
themes," said Rabbi Mark Diamond, executive vice president of the
board. "This is going to be a very interesting set of High Holy
Days."</TE>
<TE>   Diamond said the rabbis' heightened concern for Israel and the
fund-raising efforts "were barometers of what the Jewish community is
feeling. There's a universal understanding and appreciation that
Israel is facing an unprecedented crisis."</TE>
<TE>   The danger for rabbis this year is the temptation to politicize
sermons at what should be a time of heightened spiritual awareness,
said Rabbi David Eliezrie of Congregation Beth Meir HaCohen-Chabad
Center in Yorba Linda.</TE>
<TE>   He said he learned that lesson in 1993 when he used a High Holy
Day sermon to call the Oslo Accords between Israel and the
Palestinian Liberation Organization "one of the major mistakes in
Jewish history."</TE>
<TE>   "It was the wrong place to talk about it," the rabbi said. During
the holidays, when some Jews attend their only services of the year,
"we need to talk about how to deepen our spirituality and our
godliness, not speak about political flaws."</TE>

<TE>   "It was the wrong place to talk about it," the rabbi said. During
the holidays, when some Jews attend their only services of the year,
"we need to talk about how to deepen our spirituality and our
godliness, not speak about political flaws."</TE>
<TE>   Eliezrie said he'll use the example of the heroism seen on Sept.
11 to encourage his congregants to be spiritual heroes.</TE>
<TE>   "We need to learn how to have a certain degree of heroism in
spiritual values," he said. "We need people to take a stand. That's
how we can be heroes, especially to our children."</TE>

<DH>Secession: Hollywood council candidates see mutual
admiration as best way to reach common goal, cityhood.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NITA LELYVELD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>On a recent weeknight, Gene La Pietra stood at a podium in his
Hollywood Independence headquarters and offered his opponents for a
Hollywood city council seat strategic advice along with free use of
his paid staff, a dozen or so phones lining one wall of the room,
research data to help them target voters, even a dummy press kit to
copy word for word.</LD>
<LD>   The nightclub owner, who has spent $1 million to almost
single-handedly fund the Hollywood secession movement, makes no bones
about wanting to win the most votes on Nov. 5.</LD>
<LD>   But in the strange world of secession politics, La Pietra is not
trying to crush the competition--he's training it to succeed.</LD>
<TE>   A group-hug method of campaigning is seen by Hollywood
secessionists as practical and efficient.</TE>
<TE>   The 21 candidates for the five at-large council seats are, after
all, crucial foot soldiers in the battle to persuade voters to
support Hollywood independence. If secession fails, and there is no
independent Hollywood, there will be no Hollywood city council.</TE>
<TE>   The eclectic roster of candidates also helps broaden the secession
pitch's appeal.</TE>
<TE>   For a long time, the Hollywood movement seemed hardly bigger than
La Pietra himself. The money and direction still come from him and
his inner circle. But although most of the candidates come from
outside that circle, they can take the campaign into neighborhoods
where before they had little entree, giving the secession effort a
more genuine grass-roots feel.</TE>
<TE>   As five candidates sat engrossed before him, La Pietra stretched
out his arms.</TE>
<TE>   "There are people here who are dying to help you, just dying to,"
La Pietra told the fellow candidates.</TE>
<TE>   The council election and a similar one in the San Fernando Valley
will occur on the same day voters across Los Angeles decide whether
to allow the two areas to secede.</TE>
<TE>   The Valley campaigns, however, are more conventional and on a
larger scale, with candidates going head-to-head in 14 proposed
Valley council districts and a mayor's race.</TE>
<TE>   In Hollywood, the atmosphere is beyond cozy. Running for a seat on
a city council that may never exist in a city that may never exist is
unusual enough.</TE>
<TE>   But when candidates for the same seats pose for pictures at events
with their arms around one another's shoulders, and can't stop
extolling one another's best qualities, an already odd campaign
verges on the surreal.</TE>
<TE>   At the candidate-training session, La Pietra, who has never held
elective office but ran for a West Hollywood City Council seat in
1986, offered suggestions on what to say to voters and how to say it.</TE>
<TE>   He advised brevity.</TE>
<TE>   "You're a stranger. You have three seconds. They really don't know
what your message is. You could be selling Amway for all they care,"
he said.</TE>
<TE>   Then he told them what to say: that the model for an independent
Hollywood is its spruced-up and shinier neighbor, West Hollywood.</TE>
<TE>   La Pietra's generosity with advice could help him. He wants to be
the first mayor of a new Hollywood, and a grateful council would be
more likely to pick him from its ranks for the post.</TE>
<TE>   Four candidates besides La Pietra are members of the board of
Hollywood VOTE, the organization La Pietra founded to get Hollywood
secession on the ballot.</TE>
<TE>   Others saw the relatively small scale of a Hollywood
campaign--encompassing a 15-square-mile area with about 185,000
people--as a way to break into politics, and one that is less
intimidating and less expensive than fighting for a Los Angeles City
Council seat.</TE>
<TE>   "Here, $10,000. To get elected in the city, that costs maybe $10
million," said candidate Pashree "Super Pat" Sripipat, who publishes
Pacific Rim News, a bilingual Thai-English newspaper.</TE>
<TE>   She wants to be the first Thai-elected official in the Los Angeles
area.</TE>
<TE>   Sripipat's candidacy is already getting a lot of attention from
Hollywood Thais, who number about 7,000, she said.</TE>
<TE>   "To tell you the truth, my community, they are shocked right now,"
said the 55-year-old mother of three, whose newspaper is full of
secession campaign articles and photos of herself and the other
candidates.</TE>
<TE>   "First of all, Thai community candidate. Then Thai female," she
said.</TE>
<TE>   Sripipat said she hopes to be the voice of Hollywood minorities.
Her focus, she says, is getting the homeless off the streets and into
shelters and helping prostitutes find other ways to make a living.</TE>
<TE>   A few miles east, at his Sunset Boulevard flower shop, Garry
Sinanian, a 25-year-old Armenian American, said he, too, wants to
clean up Hollywood. Sinanian says he's sick of feeling threatened by
the prostitutes and drug dealers standing outside his shop when he
arrives in the pre-dawn hours.</TE>
<TE>   He also wants to represent Armenians, as he makes clear in a
campaign poster that depicts a glowing vision of the area that Los
Angeles designated Little Armenia.</TE>
<TE>   His poster is complete with flowers, palm trees and a grand
gateway that eliminates the blue city signs Los Angeles provided.</TE>
<TE>   Sinanian is advertising on Armenian cable TV, where an
Armenian-language ad for Hollywood secession--financed by Sinanian
and the secession campaign--is followed by an ad for Sinanian.</TE>
<TE>   On a recent morning, as his parents catered to customers in the
front of his flower shop, Sinanian sat in the back visiting with
fellow candidate Ed Dilkes, a Hollywood Hills resident who is city
manager of Bradbury, near Monrovia.</TE>
<TE>   Together, they watched a videotape of Sinanian's first big event,
a fund-raising dinner at an Armenian church, attended by Dilkes,
Sripipat and other candidates. Now, Sinanian and Dilkes are talking
about advertising together.</TE>
<TE>   Before secession, they would not have met, they said.</TE>
<TE>   "People in my neighborhood have no idea who Garry Sinanian is,"
said Dilkes, as he leaned back comfortably on a couch and watched the
video.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a remarkable young man," Dilkes said of Sinanian. "I
think they would find him--is this the right way to put
it?--reassuring."</TE>
<TE>   Sinanian said candidates getting to know each other across
neighborhood lines is a preview of how people would come together in
a new Hollywood.</TE>
<TE>   "We would begin to have to know each other and it would be a
wonderful experience," he said. "This is our opportunity to make
ourselves a real community."</TE>

<HD>L.A. County Jurors to Get Late Payment</HD>
<DH>Service: Courts had run out of money during the state
budget impasse. Their last check for jury duty went out Aug. 2.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ANNA GORMAN and STEVE BERRY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As if jury service weren't trying enough, Los Angeles County jurors
are doing it gratis.</LD>
<LD>   They already serve long hours performing their civic duty for a
paltry $15 a day. And if they don't show up, they may be fined as
much as $1,500. But for the last month, the Superior Court has not
kept up its end of the bargain. The last checks went out Aug. 2, and
the unpaid bill has reached $656,413.</LD>
<LD>   Who's to blame? The politicians, of course, judges say. Because
the state was so late in approving a budget, the Superior Court
simply ran out of money to pay jurors. Checks will be in the mail
soon, court officials promise. But no other California county has
delayed juror payments, state officials said.</LD>
<TE>   Julie Vlasich, one of 35,339 former jurors owed money, isn't
holding her breath.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not waiting by the mailbox," she said. "Who knows when it
will be there?"</TE>
<TE>   Jury Services Director Gloria Gomez said the court ran out of
funds when the state Legislature missed a deadline for passing the
budget. "There was just no more money," she said. "It's out of the
court's control."</TE>
<TE>   The budget impasse ended Thursday when Gov. Gray Davis approved
the spending plan. The money should start flowing again soon, Gomez
said.</TE>
<TE>   But the state budget problems have not stopped other large
counties from paying their jurors. In Alameda, Orange, San
Bernardino, Riverside, San Francisco and San Diego counties, court
officials haven't missed a payday. San Diego did it by tapping a
$30-million reserve, said Stephen Thunberg, executive officer of the
courts.</TE>
<TE>   In Los Angeles, jurors' $15 a day begins on the second day of
service. They also receive 15 cents a mile for travel expenses, one
way. Jurors typically get their checks about two weeks after they
complete service.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles County has traditionally had a tough time finding
enough jurors to satisfy the court's huge demand. About 75,000 to
100,000 citizens a week are summoned just to get the estimated 12,000
prospective jurors needed.</TE>
<TE>   Judges have cracked down recently on jurors who ignore the
summons, imposing fines as high as $1,500. Court officials are also
scrutinizing prospective jurors' hardship excuses, and continue to
urge employers to pay their workers while they serve. Jury service
has been made more convenient, though, and jurors now spend only one
day in court, unless they are selected for a jury.</TE>
<TE>   Vlasich spent 2 1/2 weeks on a jury. Every day, the Woodland Hills
resident commuted to the Santa Monica courthouse to listen to
testimony in a case of a tenant who sued his landlord after his
rental home burned down.</TE>
<TE>   Vlasich said she didn't find out about the payment holdup until
she called the court to find out why she hadn't received her check.</TE>
<TE>   "Fifteen dollars a day doesn't make much of a difference for me,"
she said. "I think I spent more than that on lunch every day. It was
more the point. They make you serve, now, and then they don't have
any money in the bank to pay you."</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge Jacqueline Connor said the
pay problem is an insult to jurors.</TE>
<TE>   "There is just no excuse for it," she said, adding that the $15
daily stipend is embarrassing in itself.</TE>
<TE>   But Connor noted that jurors have not been the only victims of the
state's budget impasse. Among those forced to wait for checks have
been needy college students, elderly and disabled people, and
lawmakers and their staffs. "I'm just glad the budget impasse is
resolved," the judge said.</TE>
<TE>   Superior Court spokesman Allan Parachini said the court didn't
have a choice about the jury payments and emphasized that all jurors
will receive their checks.</TE>
<TE>   "All money owed will be paid out," he said. "We think people
understand that the state has had acute problems passing a budget."</TE>

<HD>Martin D. Kamen, 89; Scientist Who Discovered the Element
Carbon-14</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>THOMAS H. MAUGH II</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Martin D. Kamen, whose discovery of the element carbon-14 made it
possible for biologists to decipher the complex chemistry of the
living cell, died Aug. 31 at his home in Montecito. The chemist, an
emeritus professor at both UC San Diego and USC, died four days after
his 89th birthday.</LD>
<LD>   "Without carbon-14, biochemistry as we know it today just wouldn't
exist," said UC San Diego chemist Bruno Zimm.</LD>
<LD>   The discovery also made possible the radiocarbon dating that
allows archeologists to determine the age of artifacts dating back
50,000 years, allowing the creation of precise timelines for early
civilizations.</LD>
<TE>   Kamen was working with Ernest O. Lawrence at UC Berkeley when he
and Samuel Ruben made the carbon-14 discovery in 1940, but he later
lost his position in the Communist witch hunts of World War II. His
passport was revoked, he was summoned before the House Un-American
Activities Committee and, in 1951, the Chicago Tribune and the
Washington Times-Herald publicly labeled him a suspected spy. At his
nadir, he even attempted suicide--one of the few failures in his
life.</TE>
<TE>   The charges proved groundless, however. He got his passport back,
sued the newspapers for libel and won, and in 1995 received the
Enrico Fermi Award for his pioneering contributions to physics.
Colleagues say that he should have received the Nobel Prize as well
because his discovery was crucially important to so many areas of
science.</TE>
<TE>   "They're making amends, which is better than what they would do in
Russia," Kamen said at the time of his award. "It's vindication ...
but I've spent 55 years toward that end in building my career."</TE>
<TE>   Kamen was born in Toronto in 1913, the son of Jewish immigrants.
Naturally brilliant, he was a child prodigy on the violin--a fact
that scarred the rest of his life.</TE>
<TE>   "I was [always] the center of attention," Kamen told interviewers
later. "Whenever there were family gatherings, I was expected to
perform and my cousins hated me. Everyone was out to get me. When
nobody was looking, I got beat up." That experience often led him to
denigrate his accomplishments. "I don't want to be singled out. I
didn't want to be a soloist."</TE>
<TE>   As a teenager, he switched to the viola, the better to remain in
the background. He remained an accomplished musician throughout his
career, often playing with well-known performers.</TE>
<TE>   After graduate school at the University of Chicago, he joined UC
Berkeley, where Lawrence ultimately launched him on the search for a
new isotope of carbon. Radioisotopes played a crucial role in
deciphering chemical processes within the cell. By labeling a sugar
molecule, for example, with carbon-11 molecules, biochemists could
track its progress through the cell, identifying the individual
chemicals it is sequentially converted into as the body burns it for
energy.</TE>
<TE>   But carbon-11 is short-lived--half of it disappears every 21
minutes. "By the time you have set up to do a reaction, it has
disappeared," Zimm said. Using the 60-inch cyclotron at Berkeley,
Kamen and Ruben bombarded a graphite target with a beam of deuterium
nuclei, eventually producing enough carbon-14 for identification. It
suited scientists' needs perfectly because it had a half-life of
5,730 years, much longer than had been predicted by theory.</TE>
<TE>   Typically, Kamen allowed most of the credit for the discovery to
go to Ruben, who was killed not long afterward when he inhaled
phosphene in a laboratory accident.</TE>
<TE>   Physicists soon discovered that carbon-14 is produced naturally
when the atmosphere is bombarded by cosmic rays. Plants incorporate
this radioactive isotope as they grow, so its concentration in their
tissues is the same as its concentration in the atmosphere. But when
the plant dies, no more carbon-14 is taken in and the small amount
present begins to decay, converting into nitrogen-14.</TE>
<TE>   In 1949, chemist Willard Libby of the University of California
made use of this discovery to invent radiocarbon dating.</TE>
<TE>   Kamen was a liberal, a political leaning that brought many
scientists under suspicion during the war years. While he was working
on the Manhattan Project at Tennessee's Oak Ridge National
Laboratory, he incurred further suspicion when he correctly deduced
that the project had already built a nuclear reactor, even though he
was not cleared to know about it.</TE>
<TE>   His downfall came after a 1944 dinner with two Soviet officials he
had met at a party given by violinist Isaac Stern, with whom he
occasionally played. The Russians asked him about radiation
treatments for a colleague with leukemia. FBI agents suspected a more
sinister motive, and Kamen was fired the next day.</TE>
<TE>   For nine months, the only job he could get was as an inspector in
a shipyard. Ultimately, however, he was hired by Washington
University in St. Louis. He later became a founding faculty member at
UC San Diego and taught at USC. During the 1950s and 1960s, he did
groundbreaking research on bacterial cytochromes and photosynthesis,
but he is remembered primarily for his research on carbon-14.</TE>
<TE>   Kamen's marriage to his first wife, Esther, ended in divorce in
1943. His second wife, Beka, died in 1963 and his third, Virginia,
died in 1987. He is survived by his son, David, a U.N. translator in
New York City, and a sister, Lillian Smith of Chapel Hill, N.C.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The state Justice Department said it has uncovered a methamphetamine
dump site in Black Star Canyon.</LD>
<LD>   Officials said Wednesday that they discovered 20 black trash bags
along a private road. The bags contained toxic chemical waste,
glassware, antifreeze containers and other materials.</LD>
<LD>   Investigators were most intrigued by the Canadian labels on many
chemical canisters, said drug task force Cmdr. Craig Hammer.
Officials said drug labs are increasingly using chemicals from
Canada, where they can be obtained more easily.</LD>
<TE>   About 45 pounds of methamphetamines may have been made with the
items, he said.</TE>
<TE>   The antifreeze bottles contained residue of the acid used in
preparing methamphetamines. Contaminated sheets, clothing, shoes,
gloves and respirators also were found.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities are now trying to find the lab. They were alerted to
the dump site by a tip.</TE>

<HD>O.C. Seeks Emergency Funds to Halt Slide at Irvine Landfill</HD>
<DH>Waste: County moves to spend $1.5 million on temporary
repairs to a 40-acre section that is fracturing. The site plays a
crucial role in paying off bankruptcy debt.</DH>

<LD>A 40-acre section of the Frank R. Bowerman landfill in Irvine is
buckling and fracturing, prompting officials to seek emergency funds
to halt the landslide before the rainy season begins.</LD>
<LD>   Officials said that if the landslide isn't stopped, it could
reduce the long-term capacity of the landfill at a time when the
county is using revenue from the facility to pay off bankruptcy
debts.</LD>
<LD>   The Orange County Board of Supervisors will be asked Tuesday to
declare a state of emergency at the landfill, clearing the way for
the county to spend $1.5 million to make temporary repairs.</LD>
<TE>   "This is a vital resource," said Linda Hagthrop, a county
spokeswoman. "Any reduction in capacity shortens the time period in
which we can provide this vital service."</TE>
<TE>   To pay off the bankruptcy debt, the county is accepting trash from
outside the county through 2015. The landslide, if unchecked,
threatens to reduce the lifespan of Bowerman, jeopardizing the
county's long-term plans.</TE>
<TE>   Officials aren't sure what caused the landslide, though some have
speculated that a small earthquake this year may have shifted the
soil. High levels of ground water weighed down by tons of earth
propel the slide--roughly 40 acres and 265 feet deep--about 6 inches
each month. It was first noticed in February, when large cracks
developed in the area, said Janice V. Goss, the county's Integrated
Waste Management director.</TE>
<TE>   The ground water prevents officials from using as much of the
landfill as they would like.</TE>
<TE>   "We need to put in horizontal drains made up of pipes to reduce
the pressure of the ground water, remove 800,000 cubic yards of dirt,
then grade the entire area to reduce the load," Goss said.</TE>
<TE>   Because of the size of the slide area, it will probably take at
least 10 earth-moving vehicles more than two months to finish the
project, said Michael Giancola, Bowerman's manager.</TE>
<TE>   Orange County began importing trash in October 1995, after its
financial collapse. Since then, nearly $100 million in dumping fees
has been paid by other counties' trash haulers. Much of that windfall
goes to pay off a bankruptcy bond debt of nearly $1 billion.</TE>
<TE>   Because of the imported trash, the county has proposed expanding
the size and life span of Bowerman and the Olinda Alpha landfill near
Brea to meet future local needs.</TE>

<HD>Latinos Lag in Earning College Degrees</HD>
<DH>Census: They are more likely to attend part time and less
likely than those in other population groups to get four-year or
graduate diplomas.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STUART SILVERSTEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Latino high school graduates attend college in large numbers but lag
far behind other Americans in earning four-year and graduate degrees,
limiting the economic payoff of their educations, a new analysis
says.</LD>
<LD>   The children of immigrant parents appear to be the most likely to
continue their educations beyond high school, according to the report
by the Pew Hispanic Center, a Washington, D.C.-based research group
operated by USC. More than 42% of Latino high school graduates born
in this country of such parents attended college. That rate almost
matches the college-going rate for whites in similar circumstances.</LD>
<LD>   In California, the researchers found, Latino high school graduates
overall are more likely to be in college than Latinos elsewhere.
That's partly a reflection of the size and strength of California's
community college system.</LD>
<TE>   But the report also depicts Latino college students in California
as far less likely than other groups in the state--or than Latinos in
other states--to attend four-year colleges and universities.</TE>
<TE>   Only 46.4% of Latino college students who were enrolled in higher
education attended four-year bachelor's or graduate programs,
compared with 58.2% for blacks, 63.3% for whites and 72.4% for Asians
and Pacific Islanders.</TE>
<TE>   Louis Caldera, vice chancellor of the 23-campus California State
University system, said the report "really underscores something
we've known: that the matriculation rate for students from community
colleges to four-year universities is abysmally low in California."</TE>
<TE>   The vast majority of community colleges, he said, "do a very, very
poor job of moving students who want bachelor's degrees on to the
four-year universities."</TE>
<TE>   He also said educators and other community leaders need to do a
better job of explaining the long-term economic value of going to
college full time, even if it means taking out big loans.</TE>
<TE>   "When you grow up in a family where you sometimes have to choose
between paying the rent and putting food on the table, it is not at
all evident that it makes good economic sense to borrow tens of
thousands of dollars to go to school full time for four years and
walk away with a bachelor's degree," Caldera said.</TE>
<TE>   Nationwide, Latinos are more likely than other groups to study
part time, begin at two-year colleges and enroll at older ages. All
of those factors dovetail with lower prospects for earning bachelor's
or graduate degrees.</TE>
<TE>   Pew's sampling of Latino high school graduates 25 to 29 years old
found that only 16.4% held bachelor's or graduate degrees, compared
with 36.5% for whites.</TE>
<TE>   All told, the report shows that even Latinos who make it through
high school often fail to go far in college.</TE>
<TE>   "There are a very substantial number of Latino kids who get as far
as enrolling in some form of higher education and then fail to get a
degree," said Robert Suro, director of the Pew Center. "Providing
them with some help could bring very substantial results."</TE>
<TE>   Suro suggested expanding work-study programs, simplifying the
financial aid application process and urging colleges to place more
emphasis on student retention.</TE>
<TE>   In California, Latinos enrolled in college are almost as likely to
study full time as other groups. The percentage of Latino college
students studying full time is 54%. That's just slightly behind
blacks, at 54.6%, and whites, at 56.4%, although well behind Asians
and Pacific Islanders at 73.9%.</TE>
<TE>   The Pew report said that although college attendance rates among
children of Latino immigrants nationally is relatively high, the
figure drops off among Latinos whose families have deeper roots in
this country.</TE>
<TE>   The analysis found that among Latinos who are at least the third
generation in their families to live in the United States, the
college-going rate is 35.9%, compared with the 42.4% rate of college
attendance among second-generation Latinos.</TE>
<TE>   Richard Fry, author of the report and an economist for the Pew
Center, said shortcomings in the available statistics may explain
part of the reversal. But he added that part of the stronger
performance by second-generation Latinos might be that "there's
something about the drive and expectations of immigrant parents that
shows up in the behavior of their children."</TE>
<TE>   If all Latinos are taken into account--not just high school
graduates, the group that Pew studied--the picture is far worse.</TE>
<TE>   According to a U.S. Department of Education report that studied
residents from 16 to 24 years old, the high school dropout rate for
Latinos, including the foreign-born, is 27.8%, versus 6.9% for
non-Hispanic whites and 10.9% for the overall population.</TE>
<TE>   The Pew study was based on U.S. census data on nearly 500,000
people, collected from 1997 through 2000.</TE>

<HD>A Skid Row Bistro Sounds Pretty Good, Despite Reservations</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Steve Lopez</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>If you buy into the notion that location is everything, you'd have to
say Pete McLaughlin has made a curious choice about where to open a
restaurant.</LD>
<LD>   The prostitutes aren't far from his door, and neither are the
crack addicts or the parking meter bandits. Then you've got the urban
campers of skid row Los Angeles.</LD>
<LD>   But McLaughlin, who quit a good job in marketing a year ago, is
sinking three-quarters of a million dollars into 4th and Main. Pete's
Cafe Bar, a French-American bistro located in the street-level corner
of the renovated San Fernando Building, is scheduled to open next
month.</LD>
<TE>   "Why here?" I asked McLaughlin, 42.</TE>
<TE>   "You look at two things," he said. "Who are your customers going
to be, and who's your competition?"</TE>
<TE>   The customers, he said, are the 300-plus people living in
renovated turn-of-the-century buildings at that intersection.
(McLaughlin's wife is an executive with the Gilmore Co., which
redeveloped the buildings.) They're also the employees of the Ronald
Reagan State Building, City Hall, the L.A. Times and several other
places.</TE>
<TE>   And as for the competition?</TE>
<TE>   "There is none."</TE>
<TE>   Not everyone, however, is cheering McLaughlin on. Some hearts
bleed over the possibility that downtown gentrification, along with
the conversion of tired old hotels into spiffed-up apartment houses,
will drive out the poor and spill them onto the street.</TE>
<TE>   "Skid row is the last place in the community where a person can go
if they have no money and no family," says Alice Callaghan of Las
Familias Del Pueblo.</TE>
<TE>   Nonprofit groups own two-thirds of the 60-plus hotels in the area,
she said, and they are home to 8,000 people who pay roughly $62 a
month. But developers are swooping in.</TE>
<TE>   "For them to come and take irreplaceable housing stock for people
who have no choice about where to live, so they can have some
Disneyland Manhattan experience, is outrageous and immoral," says
Callaghan.</TE>
<TE>   Especially, she adds, when the government is "throwing money" at
the developers as incentives. And, as The Times reported, City Hall
has been so blindly gung-ho at times, it has let developers get
sloppy with fire and safety codes.</TE>
<TE>   Callaghan, I must say, sounds like a saint, and I have nothing but
admiration for those who fight for the dignity of the most destitute
among us. But to tell you the truth, I think her argument is too
cynical.</TE>
<TE>   If downtown shouldn't become some kind of Disneyfied Manhattan,
neither should it be a Calcutta adventure park, with huddled misery
and the dead-end stench of urine in the air.</TE>
<TE>   Shame on Los Angeles for our indifference to so much despair. But
you don't begin to solve the problem by making the downtown of the
second-largest city in the country the exclusive domain of the
down-and-out, enabling users and abusers to rot in sprawling squalor.</TE>
<TE>   You do it with a greater commitment to mental health care, drug
and alcohol treatment--the kind of things that keep people from
crashing onto skid row in the first place. And you scatter low-rent
housing around the region rather than corralling people in wretched
isolation.</TE>
<TE>   Look, downtown Los Angeles isn't going to make a comeback on the
strength of the Staples Center and all the Grand Avenue hoo-haw.
Especially not with the new cathedral having inexplicably set itself
apart from the new city by bumping up against the highway and
concealing a splendid public space behind fortress walls.</TE>
<TE>   It's only going to work if, along with becoming Southern
California's center of commerce and culture, it's a place where
people of all persuasions live together in some balance of chaos and
harmony. A real city, in other words, with life pumping 24 hours a
day, and a bistro around the corner from a soup kitchen.</TE>
<TE>   And it can, in time, become a place where an executive lives down
the street from a secretary and shops at the same Ralphs as a
starving actor, as well as a bloke who's been in a tailspin but just
got himself a job at Pete's Cafe Bar.</TE>
<TE>   McLaughlin has already gone to Chrysalis, a job-training center
for the homeless and the poor, and to the Midnight Mission, setting
up pipelines for job applicants.</TE>
<TE>   Yes, McLaughlin admits without apology, he'll get substantial
financial incentives because of the risk of doing business in a
blighted area, and one of them is a tax credit for hiring from the
neighborhood.</TE>
<TE>   "I worked in a soup kitchen in Detroit, and I know how important
it is to create opportunity for people," McLaughlin said as work
crews drilled and hammered, bringing his new restaurant into being.
"We're going to exhibit local artists on the columns over there too.
If it's going to work, it's got to bring in people from all walks of
life."</TE>
<TE>   The storefront sat vacant, part of the downtown blight, for five
years. When he took over the property, McLaughlin snooped around in
the basement and found cast iron railing, doors and other furnishings
that were part of the original building.</TE>
<TE>   They're now being worked into the recycled space, which has served
as a drug store, a men's haberdashery, and a cigar store.</TE>
<TE>   Lunch and dinner will be served beginning Oct. 11, no reservations
required. But Christmas could be tight. A state employee from across
the street has already booked a dinner party for 40.</TE>

<HD>Long Beach Fires Manager</HD>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In a climate of community discontent over a $46-million budget
shortfall, the Long Beach City Council fired the city manager late
Wednesday, offering no official reason.</LD>
<LD>   The termination of Henry Taboada, who had held the city's top job
since 1999 after a generation of rising through the ranks of various
departments, will be effective Oct. 4, Mayor Beverly O'Neill said.
The 9-0 vote for dismissal was taken during a 3 1/2-hour emergency
closed session to review his performance.</LD>
<LD>   "There were no derogatory comments, [but] there was discontent on
the part of some council members," said O'Neill, who leads council
meetings but does not have a vote. "They are personnel issues that
I'm not going to discuss."</LD>
<TE>   Local newspapers critical of the budget deficit and Taboada's
recent purchase of a home using Vice Mayor Frank Colonna's real
estate services created public pressure on the City Council, Taboada
said.</TE>
<TE>   "I was the sacrificial lamb," a calm, pragmatic Taboada said
Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   Taboada's contract provides him with a half-year's severance pay,
or about $100,000, and the cash value of his other benefits,
estimated at about $30,000 to $40,000, the mayor said.</TE>
<TE>   Assistant City Manager Gerald Miller will serve in the interim as
the council searches for a replacement to oversee California's
fifth-largest city, which has a work force of about 5,500 full-time
employees.</TE>
<TE>   Councilman Dan Baker, who talked about wanting a new city manager
during his unsuccessful campaign for mayor, said news stories had no
influence on his drive to oust Taboada. Others, however, agreed with
Taboada that the local press had indirectly played a key role.</TE>
<TE>   Then there was the matter of Taboada's recent purchase of a home
on Naples Island, which generated numerous letters to the editor.</TE>
<TE>   The city attorney had advised Colonna that he would not break
conflict-of-interest laws by serving as a real estate agent because
his $14,000 commission would be paid by the home seller. Colonna said
he gave the commission to a charity long before newspaper criticism
appeared.</TE>

<HD>Panel Postpones Marblehead Hearing</HD>
<DH>Development: Lusk Co. wants time to respond to a critical
report on the San Clemente project.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SEEMA MEHTA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The California Coastal Commission has granted a request by the
developer of the Marblehead bluffs in San Clemente to delay a hearing
on the project until the company can respond to a critical report by
the agency's staff, commission officials said Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   The agency was scheduled to hold a public hearing Tuesday on the
Lusk Co.'s proposal to build on 250 acres of sandstone bluffs marked
by deep canyons and expanses of coastal sage-scrub. Now the hearing
on whether to allow 351 homes and 671,506 square feet of shops,
restaurants and other businesses on the site--once the proposed home
of the Nixon Library--will be postponed.</LD>
<LD>   Peter M. Douglas, executive director of the Coastal Commission,
said Lusk officials asked for a postponement until they can respond
to the report released late last week.</LD>
<TE>   Jim Johnson, Lusk chief executive, did not return several calls
seeking comment on the request or on the commission staff's findings.</TE>
<TE>   The report said the revised Marblehead plan was improved over one
that commission members were poised to veto last year. Grading of the
site was reduced by a third to nearly 2.5 million cubic yards, fewer
homes were planned, and the amount of land to be set aside as open
space was increased to 77 acres from 58 acres. The square footage of
commercial development planned for 22 acres of the property has been
decreased; however, the density of shops and businesses clustered
nearest the ocean has nearly doubled to 141,506 square feet.</TE>
<TE>   Commission staff scientists concluded that the downsized project
still would harm coastal canyons, sensitive habitats and rare plants
and animals found on the property, one of the last large undeveloped
coastal portions of Southern California.</TE>

<HD>LAX Proposal Criticized by Councilwoman</HD>
<DH>Airport: Miscikowski says residents in neighboring areas
weren't given a say in the expansion plan.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JENNIFER OLDHAM</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>City Councilwoman Cindy Miscikowski criticized the Airport Commission
on Thursday for ignoring residents as it finalizes Mayor James K.
Hahn's $9.6-billion plan to modernize aging Los Angeles International
Airport.</LD>
<LD>   Miscikowski's district inherited several of LAX's closest
neighbors, including Westchester and Playa del Rey, from longtime
expansion opponent Ruth Galanter last summer. Until this week, the
councilwoman hadn't taken a position on Hahn's plan to redesign the
world's fifth-busiest airport. In an interview, she said she approves
of several of its key tenets, but is not yet ready to endorse or
reject the entire proposal.</LD>
<LD>   The mayor's plan, which favors security over expansion, was
unveiled in July and is still in the early conceptual stages. Airport
officials shopped the document around to business and community
groups, but haven't presented it to residents who would be most
directly affected, according to a letter Miscikowski wrote to Airport
Commission President Ted Stein and the Board of Airport
Commissioners. .</LD>
<TE>   "A large number of other community groups and residents of
neighborhoods that are impacted by noise and ground traffic related
to LAX were not consulted or briefed, nor are they participating in
the current planning process," the letter charges.</TE>
<TE>   Hahn's modernization plan would entail a dramatic reworking of the
airport, including the demolition of four terminals, new
transportation facilities to the east of LAX, and the removal of all
cars in the central terminal area.</TE>
<TE>   The mayor has attempted to build political support for his plan by
having his staff meet with various groups before announcing details
and by promising former expansion opponents that he would limit LAX
to 78 million passengers a year. The airport served 61 million
passengers in 2001--52% more than its current intended capacity.</TE>
<TE>   But these concessions haven't appeased those who live adjacent to
Manchester Square--a 129-acre neighborhood whose residents are
currently being bought out by the city agency that operates LAX.
Hahn's plan calls for the construction of a check-in facility there
where travelers could park and get on an elevated train to LAX.</TE>
<TE>   "We've called the mayor's office and asked them to come meet with
us regarding the plan many times," said Denny Schneider, a member of
the board of directors of the Osage Neighbors Assn.--which represents
residents living north of Manchester Square.</TE>
<TE>   Stein did meet with a neighborhood council representing
Westchester and Playa del Rey a month ago, but made it clear that
"he's going to do what he wants to do and doesn't care what we have
to say," Schneider said.</TE>
<TE>   Stein did not return calls for comment.</TE>
<TE>   The mayor's office said it will work with Miscikowski's office to
identify neighborhood groups that haven't been briefed on the
modernization plan.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of people have an interest in this, and the mayor's staff
and the airport staff are working very hard to get to as many people
as possible," said Deputy Mayor Matt Middlebrook. "People should not
read into who got talked to first and who got talked to eighth and
who got talked to 50th. All of this input, whether first or last, is
important."Miscikowski said she expects the mayor's office to
initiate a dialogue with neighborhood groups about the plan and what
needs to be changed--particularly when it comes to Manchester Square.</TE>
<TE>   "If the plan says that's going to be a drop-off terminal, the
question still needs to be engaged with the community," she said.</TE>

<HD>LAPD Honors Officers for Heroism</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KENNETH REICH</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>For the 43rd year, the Los Angeles Police Department awarded its
Medals of Valor on Thursday, this time to six officers for heroic
work performed in 2000 and 2001.</LD>
<LD>   Luz Ruiz of Los Angeles and her father, Rafael Aparicio of Puebla,
Mexico, hugged LAPD Officers Juan Gonzalez and Ray Olivas, who
plunged into a vehicle fire Sept. 20, 2001, on the Golden State
Freeway to rescue them from a burning van.</LD>
<LD>   "We are very grateful," said Ruiz. "They acted very fast, and
thanks to them, we are well today."</LD>
<TE>   Actor and producer Edward James Olmos read the dramatic account of
the rescue, and the applause was frequent and loud. The ceremony was
attended by several hundred people, including political leaders and
officers from every division of the LAPD.</TE>
<TE>   Gonzalez and Olivas were driving on the freeway when an accident
unfolded in front of them. After being struck by another vehicle, the
van driven by Ruiz turned on its side and caught fire.</TE>
<TE>   The officers ran to the scene, and with the help of an
unidentified citizen with a fire extinguisher, were able to free Ruiz
and her father, who were entangled with the van's steering column.</TE>
<TE>   In a second incident, on Sept. 24, 2000, four K-9 officers stopped
a man who shot his wife, and, while fleeing, shot several other
people. The gunman ended the chase by killing himself.</TE>
<TE>   Honors went to Sgt. Scott DeFoe and Officers Gina Holmstrom, Brian
O'Hara and David Stambaugh. All four exchanged gunfire with the
assailant while chasing him.</TE>
<TE>   A retired police dog, Maxx, who helped in the chase, was given a
certificate of recognition--and a bone--at the award luncheon,
sponsored by the Los Angeles Area Chamber of Commerce and Wells
Fargo.</TE>
<TE>   The 10-year-old dog barked in apparent appreciation.</TE>
<TE>   Without the dog, according to Olmos' account, the situation "would
have evolved differently and much more dangerously."</TE>
<TE>   Acting Police Chief Martin Pomeroy received a standing ovation
when he was introduced. Pomeroy, brought out of retirement to replace
former Chief Bernard C. Parks, said he will happily return to fly
fishing at his home near Glacier National Park in Montana when a new
police chief is named.</TE>

<HD>Maybe a Buzzer-Beater Will Be Needed in Contest to Name
Street for Hearn</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Steve Harvey</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The pace has been as furious as an old play-by-play account by Chick
Hearn--and nearly as colorful. More than 2,000 fans have voted on
suggestions for a new street name to honor the Lakers' late
broadcaster near Staples Center.</LD>
<LD>   Chick Hearn Court is the leading choice for the stretch of 11th
Street between Figueroa and Cherry streets. The more imaginative
Chick Hearn Dribble Drive is second, followed by Chick Hearn Lane.</LD>
<LD>   The contest was started by City Councilman Nick Pacheco on the Web
site www.lacity.org/council/cd14.</LD>
<TE>   Final gun for the voting sounds Sept. 15, after which Pacheco will
present the champion vote-getter to the City Council for approval.</TE>
<TE>   Write-in suggestions that paid homage to Hearn's patter include
Nothin' But Air Drive, Refrigerator Lane and Slam Dunk Avenue.</TE>
<TE>   Then there's one that may or may not have had the broadcaster in
mind: Avenue of the Chicks.</TE>
<TE>   Speaking of nothin' but air: The police log of the Los Alamitos
News-Enterprise said that a suspicious resident had reported a man
"carrying a clipboard ... going door to door in a neighborhood,
possibly selling something."</TE>
<TE>   He was selling himself--as a City Council candidate.</TE>
<TE>   Another mystery solved: Then there was the woman "heard screaming
and pounding inside an RV." The News-Enterprise gave the explanation,
obvious in hindsight. She was just chatting on a cell phone.</TE>
<TE>   Unclear on the concept: Today's curiosities (see accompanying)
include:</TE>
<TE>   * A laundromat that doesn't seem to know that Sunday is one of the
seven days of the week (photo by Marco de Leon of L.A.).</TE>
<TE>   * A restaurant for which "daily" means only Saturday and Sunday
(photo by Robert Cook of Arleta).</TE>
<TE>   * A store entrance that doesn't know whether it's coming or going
(photo by Gordon Mintz of Mission Viejo).</TE>
<TE>   * And a porker that isn't sure where it's from (submitted by Bob
Abrahams of L.A.).</TE>
<TE>   Shocking movie-star revelation: I've always identified with Cary
Grant--if you could see my photo you'd know why--and closely followed
his formula for staying young.</TE>
<TE>   He often said he disdained exercise and ate whatever he wanted.
It's long puzzled me that, while he stayed slim, I'm 15 or so pounds
overweight.</TE>
<TE>   Then I happened to read a biography of Grant by Charles Higham and
Roy Moseley. Discussing Grant's preparations for "To Catch a Thief,"
they wrote:</TE>
<TE>   "Although he told reporters he did nothing to maintain his
fitness, this was typical of his cavalier attitude to the press. In
fact, he now began each day with push-ups (he could still manage 20
at a clip), swam laps in his pool, did fast walking and exercised
with a personal trainer." Guess I'll pass on the Virginia/Minnesota
ham.</TE>

<HD>Cell Phone Records Playing Key Role in Criminal Cases</HD>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The staples of criminal investigations are well-recognized.
Fingerprints. Weapons. Eyewitnesses.</LD>
<LD>   Now detectives are relying on a new tool: cell phones.</LD>
<LD>   Because more than 40% of Americans own mobile phones, law
enforcement personnel see them as a powerful resource in
investigations and trials. Detectives say phone records, from both
suspects and victims, can provide key evidence in murder, robbery,
drug and rape cases.</LD>
<TE>   Records of cell phone calls are more useful than those of regular
phones because they not only show what numbers were called and when,
but also reveal the area where the caller was when the call was made.
That allows police and prosecutors to track suspects'
movements--sometimes even while a kidnapping is in progress.</TE>
<TE>   The records also can destroy alibis or attack a suspect's
credibility if his statements contradict the phone data. And murder
victims' phone records can pinpoint when and where they were killed,
and connect the victim to the suspect.</TE>
<TE>   "The sooner we get those records, the better," said Det. Mike
Berchem of the Los Angeles Police Department. "They're invaluable."</TE>
<TE>   He said he has used cell phone records in every one of his
investigations during the last few years, finding suspects, witnesses
and accomplices. "It's hard evidence; it doesn't lie," he said.</TE>
<TE>   High-Profile Cases</TE>
<TE>   Cell phone records have proved important in several high-profile
cases, including the following:</TE>
<TE>   * Prosecutors used David Westerfield's cell phone records to track
his erratic movements in the days after Danielle van Dam disappeared
from her San Diego home. Within 48 hours, Westerfield drove to the
desert, the beach and back to the neighborhood where he and the Van
Dams lived. He told police he was in the desert scouting for places
to take his son camping. Last month, Westerfield was convicted of
kidnapping and murdering the 7-year-old girl.</TE>
<TE>   * Alejandro Avila said he was at an Ontario mall when 5-year-old
Samantha Runnion was kidnapped from her Orange County condo complex.
But authorities said his cell phone records showed that he was near
where the girl's body was found, off a mountain road near Lake
Elsinore. Avila is awaiting trial on murder, kidnapping and sexual
assault charges.</TE>
<TE>   * The day that LAPD Rampart Division Officer Rafael Perez stole
cocaine from an evidence locker, prosecutors said, he made cell phone
calls from near where the drugs were stolen, including one call to
his drug dealer girlfriend. "It was extremely compelling and
significant evidence," said former prosecutor Richard Rosenthal.
Though a jury deadlocked, Perez later pleaded guilty to cocaine theft
and was sentenced to five years in state prison.</TE>
<TE>   Targeting Accomplices</TE>
<TE>   Cell phones can also be used to connect suspects with their
accomplices. Los Angeles County Deputy Dist. Atty. Craig Hum recalled
the case of Rebecca Cleland, accused of hiring two cousins to kill
her 43-year-old husband, Bruce. Cell phone records showed 11 calls
between Cleland and her cousins in the hours leading up to the
murder, including one last call 10 minutes before the shooting.</TE>
<TE>   Cleland said a carjacker had knocked her unconscious. But cell
phone records placed her cousin Alvaro Quezada about a block from the
murder scene, despite his claim that he was at a restaurant 20 miles
away. "We could basically prove that he was lying," Hum said.
"Without the cell phone records, it would have been extremely
difficult to convict him."</TE>
<TE>   All three were convicted of first-degree murder in 2000 and
sentenced to life terms without parole.</TE>
<TE>   At trial, phone company representatives are called to explain to
jurors how the data are collected and what the records mean.</TE>
<TE>   Each cell phone sends a distinct signal. When a call is made, the
cell phone signal immediately attaches to the closest cell tower,
which transmits the call. As the caller moves into a different area,
the cell tower hands off the call to a new tower. Each tower handles
an average of 150 calls and reaches a half-mile to two miles in urban
areas and up to 50 miles in rural areas, said Jim Righeimer, who owns
an Orange County company that leases space for cell towers.</TE>
<TE>   Computers keep data on which tower is being used for calls. If the
cell towers are closely spaced, the data can nearly pinpoint where
the caller was at the time of the call.</TE>
<TE>   Defense attorneys sometimes challenge the evidence because cell
phones can be passed around and often are used by more than one
person. Some drug dealers have beat the system by buying cheap
phones, using them for one transaction and discarding them.</TE>
<TE>   To obtain phone records in criminal cases, law enforcement must
get a search warrant from a judge, who must determine that there is
probable cause to believe the target has committed a crime.</TE>
<TE>   The requests put companies in a tough spot, said Michael Altschul,
senior vice president of the Cellular Telecommunications and Internet
Assn. "They have a legal obligation to be responsive to law
enforcement, but on the other hand, there are privacy expectations of
their customers," he said.</TE>
<TE>   As a result, companies will only release records if they have
received a court order, Altschul said. But in kidnapping cases, when
every second is valuable, companies will make exceptions.</TE>
<TE>   Privacy Concerns</TE>
<TE>   The increased use of cell phone records worries privacy advocates.</TE>
<TE>   "We believe that typical users of cell phones have a reasonable
expectation of privacy when it comes to their location," said David
Sobel, general counsel for the nonprofit Electronic Privacy
Information Center. "That kind of collection of information is really
uniquely invasive."</TE>
<TE>   Sobel, who studies the privacy implications of new technology,
said he also fears that records will be sought more regularly in
civil litigation and divorce cases.</TE>
<TE>   LAPD Det. Dennis English said that as more people buy cell phones,
the records will become even more important. "They will probably play
a greater role in present and future crime scene investigations
because of the multitude of cell phones out there," he said.</TE>

<HD>Electric Car Goes Back to the Future</HD>
<DH></DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Greg Hanssen's electric car is in a repair shop in Cerritos. No, the
darn thing didn't break down or run out of juice; it simply had an
unfortunate run-in with a deer on a trip to the Pacific Northwest.</LD>
<LD>   Just goes to show you, if it's not one thing it's another.</LD>
<LD>   And for Hanssen, the broken headlight is nothing compared to the
dismay that, come March, he'll surrender his EV1 to General Motors as
the automotive giant backtracks from its experiment with electric
cars.</LD>
<TE>   Nobody said being a pioneer was easy.</TE>
<TE>   "It seemed like a no-brainer to me at the time," says Hanssen of
his decision to lease an EV1 in 1997. "It's definitely a futuristic
car, and that's one of the reasons I was attracted to it, because it
really stood out as something different."</TE>
<TE>   I must confess the electric-car era has, so far, eluded me. If
I've passed one on the road in the past five years, it's news to me.
Too bad, because I'd probably have given the driver a toot of the
horn and a friendly wave.</TE>
<TE>   Why? Because the world needs people like the 35-year-old
Hanssen--people who get a sniff of the future (or think they do) long
before the rest of us and dive headlong into it.</TE>
<TE>   Hanssen, an electrical engineer who lives in Irvine, is one of
those guys. Once he could afford the leasing price of around $400 a
month, he popped for an EV1 on July 4, 1997. "I loved it from the
start," he says. "Just a few months after I got the car I was
wondering what took me so long to jump in."</TE>
<TE>   What took him so long was the price (California incentives made
the lease more affordable) and an initial fear that the car was too
limiting because it could go only 60 miles before needing recharging.</TE>
<TE>   "I remember going home [after he first saw an EV1 at a dealership]
and mapping out on a Thomas Guide how far I could drive from home,"
Hanssen says.</TE>
<TE>   Over time, however, Hanssen came to learn where the recharging
stations are (more than you think in Southern California) and, more
to the point, how to change his driving habits to accommodate the
car's thirst for electrical charges.</TE>
<TE>   It was a heady time, and Hanssen and other like-minded drivers in
a group he joined felt the same--and not only because the cars went
from 0 to 60 in seven seconds. "It was just fun to squeal around the
parking lot in something not using any gasoline," Hanssen says.</TE>
<TE>   And fun to be in the vanguard while the rest of us puttered
behind. Hanssen still talks gleefully about the first time he got
behind the wheel and typed in a code instead of turning an ignition
key. "The whole dashboard lights up. You feel like you're in a
spaceship. It's really cool."</TE>
<TE>   I ask if he felt he was part of history. "Absolutely. We had
T-shirts that said 'Driving the Future.' We were totally into this."</TE>
<TE>   As it turns out, the future isn't here just yet. GM is recalling
the EV1s and declaring the experiment a grand one, but a failed one.</TE>
<TE>   "The market never really grew the way the industry thought it
would," says GM spokesman Donn Walker. "We believed genuinely there
would eventually be a market for them ... but that never happened.
It's time for the industry to admit that electric vehicles really are
not proving to be sustainable or viable or marketable, and it's time
to move on to the next technology."</TE>
<TE>   Hanssen thinks the industry is giving up too soon. Toyota still
makes an electric vehicle, and he says that'll replace his beloved
EV1.</TE>
<TE>   I feel like apologizing to Hanssen on behalf of all wimps who
didn't take the leap with him.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't knock you," he says. "We had to make a leap of faith
ourselves to try it."</TE>
<TE>   So he's not demoralized? "Let's just say," he says, "I enjoy
hitting my head against a brick wall and will continue to do so."</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Edward Kirkman, 75, a former New York Daily News reporter who scooped
the competition on the prison release of legendary bank robber Willie
Sutton, died of cancer Sunday at his home in Medford on Long Island.</LD>
<LD>   The Brooklyn-born, World War II Navy veteran went to work as a
copy boy at the News in 1946 for $23 a week and became one of its top
reporters, covering such stories as the sinking of the Italian liner
Andrea Doria, the mob slaying of gangster Joseph "Crazy Joey" Gallo
and the San Francisco trial of newspaper heiress turned revolutionary
Patty Hearst.</LD>
<LD>   When Sutton--who was famous for saying that he robbed banks
because "that's where the money is"--was freed from prison on
Christmas Eve in 1969, Kirkman escorted him from Attica to New York
on a plane that had been chartered by the News.</LD>
<TE>   He got his exclusive interview while other papers were trying to
find Sutton.</TE>
<TE>   Kirkman also once posed as a derelict to write a two-part series
exposing conditions in a men's shelter.</TE>
<TE>   He won numerous awards during a 41-year career before taking early
retirement in 1987.</TE>

<HD>D.A. Raids Filming Promoter</HD>
<DH>Investigation: Seizures target marketing costs, possible
perjury at agency that assists production firms in L.A.</DH>

<LD>Prosecutors raided the offices of an agency that promotes film
production in Los Angeles on Thursday as part of an investigation
into its marketing expenses and possible perjury, authorities said.</LD>
<LD>   Records were seized at the offices of Entertainment Industry
Development Corp. in the 7000 block of Hollywood Boulevard.</LD>
<LD>   The seizures were part of raids that included the San Dimas home
of the agency's president, Cody Cluff, and a Covina residence,
according to sources with knowledge about the probe. Cluff declined
to comment.</LD>
<TE>   The raid involved investigators from the district attorney's
office and officials from the county auditor-controller's office.</TE>
<TE>   Sources familiar with the auditor's probe said investigators have
asked about expenditures for tickets to entertainment events, parties
and an "owner's box" at a sporting facility, all of which are used
for entertaining film company executives and politicians.</TE>
<TE>   The sources said investigators also appear to be interested in
political contributions made by the agency.</TE>
<TE>   The district attorney's office declined to comment.</TE>
<TE>   County Supervisor Mike Antonovich said he was notified Thursday
morning that subpoenas had been issued. Antonovich praised the agency
for helping to attract film productions and for breaking through red
tape.</TE>
<TE>   "I was not aware of any misuse of funds or allegations of misuse
of funds until I got the county memo this morning," he said. "I
believe that [Cluff] has done a good job and the facts will show
that."</TE>
<TE>   The corporation promotes Los Angeles to the film industry and
helps production companies navigate government permitting processes.</TE>
<TE>   It also coordinates local government services--such as street
closures and the rental of city or county facilities--that are
involved when production companies shoot films on location throughout
the county.</TE>
<TE>   The production companies pay for those services through the
development corporation, which forwards the money to the
municipalities that provided them.</TE>
<TE>   The 45-person staff keeps $450 from each company to fund its
$3-million annual budget.</TE>
<TE>   The county Board of Supervisors received a memo from the auditor's
office Thursday informing members that the probe concerned
"misappropriation of funds and perjury." There were no further
details in the memo.</TE>
<TE>   Morrie Goldman, a vice president at the agency, confirmed that the
corporation makes political contributions, but said they were only to
causes, not individuals.</TE>
<TE>   For instance, Goldman said his agency has contributed $10,000 to
groups opposing secession by the San Fernando Valley and Hollywood.
The agency has also contributed to groups favoring expansion of
police and fire facilities, Goldman said.</TE>
<TE>   Corporation officials say they do not know what the investigators
are looking for.</TE>
<TE>   "We're still trying to figure it out," said Teresa Ellis, the
corporation's attorney.</TE>
<TE>   Goldman said: "There has been an inquiry into [the corporation's]
marketing expenditures, moneys used to promote Los Angeles to the
entertainment industry.</TE>
<TE>   "We've been in communications with [investigators] and providing
them with information for the past year, and we will continue to
cooperate," he said.</TE>

<HD>Sheriff's Officials Welcome High-Tech Windfall</HD>
<DH>Crime: The department plans to spend latest $750,000
federal grant to add more mobile capability to its advanced computer
system.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HOLLY J. WOLCOTT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Imagine law enforcement officers scanning driver's licenses like
credit cards to issue traffic tickets and lineups taking place in
squad cars equipped with computer screens.</LD>
<LD>   Or patrol cars so loaded with technology that they offer satellite
map displays with blinking dots to indicate crime scenes and
digitized directions that offer the fastest routes to get there.</LD>
<LD>   With the announcement this week that an additional $750,000 in
federal money is on its way, Ventura County sheriff's officials say
they have moved much closer to making that kind of futuristic
policing possible.</LD>
<TE>   "We have come so far already, but this will allow us to make
significant progress," said Cmdr. Brent Morris, supervisor of the
sheriff's technical services bureau.</TE>
<TE>   The latest windfall marks the third time the U.S. Department of
Justice has invested in Ventura County's Integrated Justice
Information System.</TE>
<TE>   Since 1999, the Sheriff's Department has received nearly $3
million to develop a computer system that links data and
investigative information from several policing agencies. Officials
hope to receive a grant for an additional $1 million.</TE>
<TE>   "This technology, which was important before last year's terrorist
attacks, has taken on new significance," said U.S. Rep. Elton
Gallegly (R-Simi Valley), who lobbied for the funds.</TE>
<TE>   Sheriff's officials plan to use the latest grant to outfit 90
patrol cars with new mobile computers that can run the advanced
software, Morris said.</TE>
<TE>   The new computers will replace older models that perform only
basic functions, such as checking driver's license, car registration
and arrest warrant data.</TE>
<TE>   In the department's remaining 100 vehicles--many of which are
unmarked cars--detectives use portable laptop computers.</TE>
<TE>   After the new computers are installed, which should be within the
next six months, officials want to add software that will integrate
the department's dispatch center with its patrol units.</TE>
<TE>   For example, the software would allow a call for police help to
automatically appear on a patrol car's computer screen, accompanied
by a beep, that would alert the nearest deputy to roll to a crime
scene.</TE>
<TE>   Currently, dispatchers at the department's headquarters in Ventura
primarily receive telephone calls for service and then radio patrol
cars.</TE>
<TE>   Within the next few years, Morris hopes deputies will be able to
check probation and inmate records and photos from their patrol cars,
as well as type reports and electronically file them.</TE>
<TE>   The software that would allow users to scan driver's licenses,
create computerized photo lineups and access graphic mapping will be
compatible with the new computers but will require more funding, he
said.</TE>

<LD>Orange County health officials closed nearly half a mile of shoreline
at Poche Beach on Wednesday after raw sewage tainted ocean waters.</LD>
<LD>   A possible line blockage caused 2,000 gallons of waste to flow out
of a mobile home park on the inland side of Coast Highway and into
Poche Creek, which empties into the ocean. Coastal waters 1,200 feet
on either side of the creek's mouth will be off limits to swimmers
until bacteria levels drop, said a spokeswoman for Orange County's
Health Care Agency.</LD>

<HD>Man, 75, Gets 1 Year to Life on Each of 9 Molestation
Charges</HD>
<DH>Courts: Former Ventura County school board member receives
the maximum sentence in a case that involved two of his children more
than 30 years ago.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TRACY WILSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Standing stooped before the sentencing judge, a 75-year-old retired
schoolteacher and former Ventura County school board member
apologized Thursday for molesting his children three decades ago and
pleaded for leniency.</LD>
<LD>   "I am very sorry if I caused any harm to my children," Albert
Rosen said in a gravelly voice, his balding head bowed. "I can't
explain it. But I am sorry."</LD>
<LD>   However, Rosen's apologies came too late and his crime was too
reprehensible to warrant any leniency, Superior Court Judge Charles
McGrath said.</LD>
<TE>   McGrath rejected Rosen's plea for probation and ordered the Simi
Valley man to serve one year to life in state prison for each of the
nine molestation charges on which he was convicted earlier this
year--the maximum sentence possible.</TE>
<TE>   It is a sentence unlikely to be found in the current edition of
the California Penal Code but reflects the state of the law in 1966,
when Rosen's crimes were first committed.</TE>
<TE>   Rosen, a longtime member of the Ventura County Board of Education,
was arrested last year after his adult son, Ron Rosen, told
authorities that his father had forced sex on him and a sibling
between 1966 and 1970. The children were 9 and 6.</TE>
<TE>   According to court documents, the son, now 45, had remembered the
assaults for years but assumed nothing could be done because they
occurred so long ago.</TE>
<TE>   But in 1994, California lawmakers amended the penal code to allow
charges to be filed in certain sex assault cases regardless of when
the alleged conduct occurred.</TE>
<TE>   The alleged crime must constitute "substantial sexual conduct" and
be independently corroborated by other evidence. The law also
requires that the victim must have been under 18 at the time of the
alleged offense and that charges must be filed within one year of the
victim's reporting the crime.</TE>
<TE>   Ron Rosen filed a complaint in April 2000 after learning of the
law change, and that led to charges concerning the second child. The
charges involving Ron Rosen were later dismissed, but the counts
involving his sibling remained.</TE>
<TE>   In June, Albert Rosen waived a jury trial, and a month later he
was convicted on all nine counts.</TE>
<TE>   At Thursday's sentencing hearing, Ron Rosen urged McGrath to send
his father to prison for stealing his childhood and leaving emotional
scars that may never heal.</TE>
<TE>   Senior Deputy Dist. Atty. Ernesto Acosta told the judge that
instead of creating a safe environment for his children, Albert Rosen
sexually abused them and kept them silent with fear.</TE>
<TE>   "The defendant hijacked their childhood," the prosecutor said. "He
deserves to spend the rest of his years in the state prison system."</TE>
<TE>   But Oxnard defense attorney Joseph O'Neill argued that Albert
Rosen "has led an exemplary life" and should be spared prison.</TE>
<TE>   O'Neill said Rosen has no previous criminal history and has
suffered from the allegations. Albert Rosen was forced to resign from
the school board after his conviction. A retired high school teacher,
he had served for nearly a dozen years.</TE>
<TE>   "His whole life has been shattered," O'Neill said, adding that
because of age and poor health, sending his client to state prison
"would be a death sentence."</TE>
<TE>   However, McGrath was not persuaded. He handed down the maximum
sentence, then rejected a plea by the defense to allow Rosen to
remain free on bail pending an appeal.</TE>
<TE>   After the judge stepped down from the bench, Rosen, a short man

<HD>Maximum Term in 1960s Sex Case</HD>
<DH>Courts: Former Ventura County school board member gets one
year to life on each of nine molestation counts involving his child.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TRACY WILSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Standing stooped before the sentencing judge, a 75-year-old retired
schoolteacher and former Ventura County school board member
apologized Thursday for molesting his children three decades ago and
pleaded for leniency.</LD>
<LD>   "I am very sorry if I caused any harm to my children," Albert
Rosen said in a gravelly voice, his balding head bowed. "I can't
explain it. But I am sorry."</LD>
<LD>   However, Rosen's apologies came too late and his crime was too
reprehensible to warrant any leniency, Superior Court Judge Charles
McGrath said.</LD>
<TE>   McGrath rejected Rosen's plea for probation and ordered the Simi
Valley man to serve one year to life in state prison for each of the
nine molestation charges on which he was convicted earlier this
year--the maximum sentence possible.</TE>
<TE>   It is a sentence unlikely to be found in the current California
Penal Code but that reflects the state of the law in 1966, when
Rosen's crimes were first committed.</TE>
<TE>   Rosen, a longtime member of the Ventura County Board of Education,
was arrested last year after his adult son, Ron Rosen, told
authorities that his father had forced sex on him and a sibling
between 1966 and 1970. The children were 9 and 6.</TE>
<TE>   According to court documents, the son, now 45, had remembered the
assaults for years but assumed nothing could be done because they
occurred so long ago.</TE>
<TE>   But in 1994, California lawmakers amended the penal code to allow
charges to be filed in certain sex assault cases regardless of when
the alleged conduct occurred.</TE>
<TE>   The alleged crime must constitute "substantial sexual conduct" and
be independently corroborated by other evidence. The law also
requires that the victim must have been under 18 at the time of the
alleged offense and that charges must be filed within one year of the
victim's reporting the crime.</TE>
<TE>   Ron Rosen filed a complaint in April 2000 after learning of the
law change, and that led to charges concerning the second child. The
charges involving Ron Rosen were later dismissed, but the counts
involving his sibling remained.</TE>
<TE>   In June, Albert Rosen waived a jury trial and a month later was
convicted on all nine counts.</TE>
<TE>   At Thursday's sentencing hearing, Ron Rosen urged McGrath to send
his father to prison for stealing his childhood and leaving emotional
scars that may never heal.</TE>
<TE>   Senior Deputy Dist. Atty. Ernesto Acosta told the judge that
instead of creating a safe environment for his children, Albert Rosen
sexually abused them and kept them silent with fear.</TE>
<TE>   "The defendant hijacked their childhood," the prosecutor said. "He
deserves to spend the rest of his years in the state prison system."</TE>
<TE>   But Oxnard defense attorney Joseph O'Neill argued that Albert
Rosen "has led an exemplary life" and should be spared prison.</TE>
<TE>   O'Neill said Rosen has no previous criminal history and has
suffered from the allegations. Albert Rosen was forced to resign from
the school board after his conviction. The retired high school
teacher had served for nearly a dozen years.</TE>
<TE>   "His whole life has been shattered," O'Neill said, adding that due
to age and poor health, sending his client to state prison "would be
a death sentence."</TE>
<TE>   However, McGrath was not persuaded. He handed down the maximum
sentence, then rejected a plea by the defense to allow Rosen to
remain free on bail pending an appeal.</TE>
<TE>   "This court denies bail," McGrath said. "I find he is a danger to
the community."</TE>
<TE>   After the judge stepped down from the bench, Rosen, a short man
with rounded shoulders, huddled with his lawyers at the counsel
table. He then stood up slowly and was led to a holding cell to await
transport to state prison.</TE>
<TE>   Outside the courtroom, Acosta said he expects that Rosen, who will
be eligible for parole in a year, will file an appeal challenging the
state law that allows certain cases to be filed well after the
statute of limitations has expired. But he said he doubts it will go
far.</TE>
<TE>   The California Supreme Court has upheld the law in question.</TE>

<HD>Tape of Murder Suspect Heard</HD>
<DH>Testimony: In a police interview, Ramiro Salgado admits
taking part in fatal beating of a Ventura man. Defense says
confession is false.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TRACY WILSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A Ventura jury Thursday heard a tape-recorded interview in which a
murder defendant admits taking part in the fatal beating of an
18-year-old Ventura Theater stagehand.</LD>
<LD>   On the tape, Ramiro Salgado, 23, tells detectives that he hit and
kicked William Zara as the wounded man tried to shield himself from
attackers on the night of Sept. 25, 1999.</LD>
<LD>   Zara died outside his apartment in west Ventura after being
bludgeoned with a shovel and baseball bat by gang members who
mistakenly thought he and his friends had reported their loud party
to police.</LD>
<TE>   In the two-hour recording, Salgado denies wielding the shovel or
stabbing Zara with a knife.</TE>
<TE>   But he tells Ventura Police Det. Patrick Stevens and Ventura
County district attorney's investigator Dennis Fitzgerald that he
kicked Zara in the back as he knelt on the ground.</TE>
<TE>   "I stomped him," Salgado says on the tape. "I'll take the blame
for that."</TE>
<TE>   Defense attorney Richard Loftus contends that Salgado gave in to
police pressure after an exhaustive two-hour interview and told them
what he thought they wanted to hear. He says the confession is false.</TE>
<TE>   It is an argument that has been persuasive before.</TE>
<TE>   In May, Superior Court Judge Vincent J. O'Neill Jr. declared a
mistrial after a previous jury was unable to decide whether Salgado
was guilty of second-degree murder.</TE>
<TE>   Lawyers said the panel--which deadlocked 9 to 3 for
acquittal--could not agree on whether Salgado's statement to police
was a truthful confession. Prosecutors decided to retry the case.</TE>
<TE>   On Wednesday, Stevens testified that police initially were not
sure whether Salgado, described as a west Ventura gang member, was a
witness or a participant in the attack.</TE>
<TE>   Stevens said he and Fitzgerald picked up Salgado on Aug. 16, 2000,
to talk to him about the crime. The detective admitted that he used
false information to "bluff" Salgado into talking about his role in
the beating.</TE>
<TE>   Eventually, he said, Salgado admitted being in the courtyard where
Zara was beaten and taking part in the attack.</TE>
<TE>   Senior Deputy Dist. Atty. Maeve Fox played the tape-recorded
interview for jurors Thursday. At one point near the end of the
recording, Salgado becomes upset and accuses the detective of lying
to him after Stevens tells Salgado he is going to be arrested.</TE>
<TE>   "But you said you were going to let me go," Salgado says
anxiously. "You told me to tell you I was back there, so I told you.
Honestly, I wasn't back there."</TE>
<TE>   "The problem is, Ramiro," Fitzgerald responds, "you were involved
in this. We have no choice."</TE>
<TE>   On cross-examination Thursday, Loftus questioned the police
tactics and pointedly asked Stevens whether he lied to Salgado.</TE>
<TE>   Stevens denied that he lied, but later admitted that he used false
information to determine the level of Salgado's involvement.</TE>
<TE>   Testimony is expected to continue next week.</TE>
<TE>   Salgado is the last of five defendants to stand trial in Zara's
slaying. Four others were convicted of murder last year and are
serving life sentences.</TE>

<LD>An anonymous benefactor has donated almost $10 million to three
nonprofit organizations, including the senior center where she
enjoyed lunch for $1.85.</LD>
<LD>   The woman, who was in her 90s, died in the past year. She was a
frequent user of the Avenidas senior center, which offers everything
from yoga and Internet classes to health screening and
transportation.</LD>
<LD>   "It was so unexpected," said Lisa Hendrickson, executive director
for the center. "We were so important to her."</LD>
<TE>   Hendrickson said she doesn't yet know how much money the center
will actually receive, and the paperwork process could take as long
as six months.</TE>
<TE>   But the gift comes at a good time. Avenidas has an annual budget
of $3.2 million, but lost 40% of its funding from United Way this
year, and expects more cuts related to state budget woes.</TE>

<LD>A riot sparked by racial tension at the North County Correctional
Facility on Thursday sent two inmates and a Los Angeles County
sheriff's deputy to the hospital with injuries, authorities said.</LD>
<LD>   The 7:15 p.m. melee, which pitted black inmates against Latinos,
was broken up within 30 minutes by deputies firing rubber bullets and
nonlethal grenades, Sheriff's Sgt. Joe Efflandt said. About 400
inmates of an estimated jail population of 2,000 participated, he
said.</LD>
<LD>   Thirteen prisoners received minor injuries and were treated at the
scene. Two others were hospitalized with what Efflandt said were
"serious" wounds. One deputy received minor injuries, he said. An
investigation will determine if any inmates will face criminal
charges.</LD>

<HD>GOP Stalwart Attacks Simon</HD>
<DH>Politics: Former Reagan advisor Lyn Nofziger says the
gubernatorial candidate is 'inept, weak ... and too dumb.' Campaign
says statement is unfortunate.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>As Bill Simon Jr. sought Thursday to right his struggling
gubernatorial campaign, the Republican hopeful suffered a new blow
from an unlikely source: a veteran GOP strategist touted as one of
Simon's top advisors.</LD>
<LD>   Lyn Nofziger, a conservative stalwart since his days in Sacramento
with then-Gov. Ronald Reagan, denounced Simon as "inept, weak ... and
too dumb" to beat incumbent Democrat Gray Davis.</LD>
<LD>   Further, Nofziger said he never worked for Simon, despite an
announcement from the campaign earlier this summer in which Nofziger
was described as a senior advisor to "Team Simon."</LD>
<TE>   "I never signed onto anything," Nofziger said in a telephone
interview Thursday night, during which he vouched for the commentary
that first surfaced on the Web site of Campaign for California
Families, a group that says it lobbies for conservative family
values.</TE>
<TE>   "If I considered myself an advisor to the campaign, I wouldn't
have written that," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Nofziger said he originally wrote the opinion piece for his
personal Web site, a compendium of his daily musings on politics that
are occasionally circulated among campaign insiders. He said he was
inspired by the flap this week over Simon's position on gay rights.</TE>
<TE>   Under pressure from some conservative backers, Simon disavowed his
campaign's response to a gay rights questionnaire, including pledges
to sign a Gay Pride Day proclamation and to support job benefits for
partners of gay state employees.</TE>
<TE>   Nofziger, who wrote his commentary before Simon's disavowal,
described the candidate's stance as a "spit in the eye of his
conservative, pro-family base."</TE>
<TE>   "Californians now are going to have a clear choice when they go to
the polls to elect a governor this November," Nofziger wrote.</TE>
<TE>   "They can reelect an inept, corrupt incumbent Democrat named Gray
Davis," he added. "Or they can elect an inept, weak and not very
bright Republican named Bill Simon. Take your pick. But be smart. Bet
on Davis. Simon is too dumb to win and his senior consultant, Sal
Russo, isn't much better."</TE>
<TE>   Asked Thursday night if he stood by those comments given Simon's
denial that he had reviewed or personally signed the questionnaire,
Nofziger replied, "I don't have any choice."</TE>
<TE>   A spokesman for the Simon campaign, Mark Miner, said Nofziger was
no longer associated with the campaign.</TE>
<TE>   "Obviously, these are unfortunate comments from somebody who
doesn't know the candidate very well and hasn't spent any time with
him at all," Miner said. "He attended one meeting, if that, and was
never paid by the campaign."</TE>
<TE>   Eager to steer his troubled campaign back toward issues, Simon
rallied a group of GOP women in Garden Grove before touting education
reform at a charter school in Watts. The events gave Simon a break
from the defensive posture into which he has been forced nearly the
entire summer by troubles both personal and political.</TE>
<TE>   Simon began the morning with an emotional pledge to keep swinging
at Davis, who has spent $18 million on television ads over the summer
that Simon said are "trying to trash me and my family, my business,
my career."</TE>
<TE>   "He's got the arrogance of power, and we've got the vision."</TE>
<TE>   But in what appeared to be an allusion to recent sniping within
Republican ranks about his candidacy, he appealed for unity within
the party.</TE>
<TE>   "We need to stop fighting one another," Simon told about 200
members and guests of the Orange County Federation of Republican
Women. "We can't afford to waste one day."</TE>
<TE>   Simon's campaign also began its first round of network television
advertisements since the Republican primary in the early spring.</TE>
<TE>   The campaign has previously aired an ad mainly on cable stations.</TE>
<TE>   Davis, by contrast, has broadcast advertising for months that has
focused relentlessly on Simon's problems, including a $78-million
fraud judgment handed down by a Los Angeles jury earlier this summer
against Simon's family company.</TE>
<TE>   Russo, Simon's campaign consultant, said the new ad, featuring
former New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, will change the campaign's
dynamic.</TE>
<TE>   The ad was aired on a few stations Thursday and will air statewide
today, Russo said.</TE>
<TE>   At the Watts Learning Center, Simon shared hugs with grinning
grade-schoolers and took a break to read with 8-year-old Devonne
Bowman.</TE>
<TE>   When asked what a governor does, Simon replied, "A governor is
very important because the governor sets a tone for the whole state.
The tone I want to set is that California is a place that's friendly
to all people."</TE>
<TE>   Simon praised the elementary school of 224 students for its
academic standing, which he attributed to flexible arrangements
between school and community that, he said, are not allowed with
traditional public schools.</TE>
<TE>   The state should expand the number of charter schools and give
them more money, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Simon also criticized Davis for the $98.9-billion budget that the
governor signed Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   The budget was signed 65 days after the July 1 deadline contained
in the state Constitution--a record for tardiness.</TE>
<TE>   Simon criticized the budget for carrying more than $10 billion in
debt but declined to say how he would eliminate the deficit if
elected.</TE>
<TE>   Simon's lack of budget specifics has become sport for the Davis
campaign, which distributes a daily report on how many days have
passed--114 on Thursday--without a Simon budget plan to match Davis'.</TE>
<TE>   "Davis always points fingers and says, 'Give us more specifics,' "
Simon said. "You're the governor, you give us more specifics."</TE>
<TE>   Davis spokesman Gabriel Sanchez, who shadowed Simon at both
events, retorted that Simon has failed after "oceans of time" to
produce suggestions for budget cuts or revenue increases.</TE>
<TE>   "The guy's going around talking about how much more money he would
spend," Sanchez said before repeating an insult first hurled by
former Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan during his primary campaign
against Simon: "In the words of Dick Riordan, he's a sanctimonious
hypocrite."</TE>
<TE>   Today, Simon planned to take a day off campaigning to spend his
wedding anniversary with wife, Cindy, and then resume his efforts in
Northern California.</TE>

<HD>Ventura Surf's Up--Way Up</HD>
<DH>Weather: The season's largest swells, courtesy of a
tropical offshore system, draw hundreds of wave-seekers after a
ho-hum summer.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JENIFER RAGLAND</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>After an entire summer of flat, ho-hum waves, nothing was going to
keep Bob Smiley out of the water Thursday morning.</LD>
<LD>   Not even work.</LD>
<LD>   The 46-year-old systems engineer from Thousand Oaks traded his
shirt and tie for a wetsuit and headed to Ventura's Surfers Point,
where swells fueled by Tropical Storm Herman reached 5 to 6 feet.</LD>
<TE>   He got there at 8:30 a.m. and stayed until about noon.</TE>
<TE>   "I plan meetings around when the surf's up," said Smiley, who has
been surfing since 1969. "It's been a pretty crummy summer--this is
one of the best swells we've had."</TE>
<TE>   Smiley was one of hundreds who flocked to the famed point near
Seaside Park in Ventura on Thursday, hoping to get a piece of the
higher-than-normal surf that has pounded the coastline since
Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   Although the waves were not as towering as those in other parts of
Southern California, they still drew a steady stream of surfers and
onlookers.</TE>
<TE>   Swells reaching up to 8 feet are expected on Ventura's
south-facing beaches through today as the tropical storm remains
about 800 miles southwest of Point Conception, said Bruce Rockwell, a
meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Oxnard.</TE>
<TE>   Even in the middle of a weekday, the drizzly gray coastline was
dotted with dozens of die-hard wave-seekers.</TE>
<TE>   "When the surf's up like this, all the old hard-core ones come out
of the woodwork," said Carrie Johnson, a lifeguard at San
Buenaventura State Beach.</TE>
<TE>   The less hard-core also ventured out Thursday, including
11-year-old Brent McMahan of Port Hueneme.</TE>
<TE>   Looking a little weary, the boy happily set his board down on the
beach and reached for a soda as he took a break from a two-hour
session.</TE>
<TE>   "I lost control of the board," Brent said, still catching his
breath. "It was pretty rough."</TE>
<TE>   His dad, Gary McMahan, who has been surfing for 30 years, said he
wants to teach his son to love the sport as much as he does. And
there is no better place to learn than Surfers Point, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "All the people who are serious about surfing come here," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Raul Sandoval, a 20-year-old student at Oxnard College, usually
surfs at Silver Strand Beach but decided to come to Ventura when he
saw the surf report.</TE>
<TE>   "They call this Surfers Point, right?" he said. "I can see why."</TE>
<TE>   Winds made the surf choppy, which made it difficult to get out of
the breakwater, Sandoval said. But once he did, he said, it was worth
it.</TE>
<TE>   "The bigger the wave, the bigger the rush," he said.</TE>
<TE>   UC Santa Barbara student Nicole Framberger also prefers big waves.
Luckily, she is still in summer session and didn't have class
Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   "Since the surf has been so small, any time anyone hears there's a
swell coming in, people flock to the beach," she said. "I don't blame
them. I heard there was a swell and I came out."</TE>
<TE>   Despite the crowds, lifeguards and surfers reported no problems or
major injuries Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   "Today, there are enough waves for everybody," Smiley said.</TE>
<TE>   While the offshore storm was a boon to surfers, it generated only
a light drizzle over Ventura County--not enough to ease the extreme
fire danger that has come from an unusually dry spring and summer,
said Sandi Wells, spokeswoman for the Ventura County Fire Department.</TE>
<TE>   Even worse, she said, forecasts Thursday called for possible
thunderstorms through today. "Our concern with this weather would be
small amounts of rain and lightning strikes," Wells said. "That would
be a problem."</TE>

in Ventura on Thursday for 5-to 6-foot waves produced by Tropical
Storm Herman, which was about 800 miles off the Central California
coast. "The bigger the wave, the bigger the rush," said one surfer.</CP>

<HD>Jane Ward, 98; Philanthropist Active in Many Civic Groups</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From a Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Jane Ward, a philanthropist who was instrumental in starting and
aiding numerous civic organizations in Los Angeles and Laguna Beach,
has died. She was 98.</LD>
<LD>   Ward, who co-founded the Southern California Republican Women's
Club in the 1950s, died Tuesday of pneumonia at a retirement home in
Montecito.</LD>
<LD>   Ward began her philanthropic and volunteer work with the Junior
League of Los Angeles and Childrens Hospital Los Angeles, for which
she was a founding member of its fund-raising group, Las Madrinas.</LD>
<TE>   She also was a founding member of the Good Samaritan Hospital
Auxiliary, the Mid-Town Club, the Los Angeles County Museum of Art,
the Music Center, the Blue Ribbon Four Hundred and the Hollywood Bowl
Patroness Committee.</TE>
<TE>   She served on the boards of the Otis Art Institute Associates and
the Laguna Art Museum.</TE>
<TE>   Ward also helped start the House Ear Institute Associates, and was
a founding board member of the Laguna Art School and
founder-president of its support group, the Designing Women.</TE>
<TE>   Born in 1904 in Gainesville, Texas, Ward was home-schooled on a
large cattle ranch before attending the exclusive Hockaday School in
Dallas. After graduating in 1922, she and her four siblings moved to
Los Angeles with their mother.</TE>
<TE>   Ward attended the Otis Art Institute for two years and the State
Normal School, which later became UCLA. In 1928, she married Robert
"Pike" Brant, the son of Otto F. Brant, founder of Title Insurance &amp;
Trust Co. The elder Brant also had been a partner in a local land
development group that included Harrison Gray Otis, owner and
publisher of the Los Angeles Times; his son-in-law and future
publisher, Harry Chandler; Moses H. Sherman; Benton Van Nuys; and
Hobart J. Whitley.</TE>
<TE>   Ward was a founding trustee of Pitzer College, and donated Pitzer
Tower in memory of her husband, who died in 1958. Three years after
his death, she married William Ward.</TE>
<TE>   She is survived by her daughter, Marilyn Brant Chandler DeYoung of
Santa Barbara; her son, David Brant of Kalispell, Mont.; nine
grandchildren; and 18 great-grandchildren. Another son, Robert Brant
Jr., and a grandson, Norman Brant Chandler, are deceased.</TE>
<TE>   A memorial service will be held at 11 a.m. Saturday at St. Alban's
Episcopal Church, 580 Hilgard Ave., Westwood.</TE>
<TE>   In lieu of flowers, the family requests that donations in Ward's
memory be sent to Las Madrinas of Childrens Hospital Los Angeles,
4650 Sunset Blvd., Mail Stop 29, Los Angeles, CA 90027.</TE>

<HD>SIX GAMES TO WATCH</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Robyn Norwood</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>No. 1 Miami (1-0)</LD>
<LD>   at No. 6 Florida (1-0)</LD>
<LD>   Kickoff: 2 p.m. TV: Channel 2. Line: Florida by 2 1/2.</LD>
<TE>   Miami update: This gargantuan game in the Swamp won't resemble the
Hurricanes' opener. (It took only 11 snaps for quarterback Ken Dorsey
to stake Miami to a 35-0 lead in a 63-17 victory over Florida A&amp;M.)
Still, defending national champion Miami has won 23 games in a
row--Dorsey is 27-1 as a starter--and the Hurricanes have an 11-game
road winning streak.</TE>
<TE>   Florida update:  The Gators poured on the points in a 51-3 victory
over Alabama Birmingham in the debut of Coach Ron Zook.</TE>
<TE>   Story line: Rex Grossman and Dorsey--second and third in the
Heisman Trophy voting last season--headline the revival of a fierce
rivalry.</TE>
<TE>   The pick: Miami. The Hurricanes stopped Florida State's 54-game
home winning streak last season and have a 14-12 record against
Florida in Gainesville.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Alabama (1-0)</TE>
<TE>   at No. 2 Oklahoma (1-0)</TE>
<TE>   Kickoff: 12:30 p.m. TV: Channel 7. Line: Oklahoma by 12.</TE>
<TE>   Alabama update: Alabama, mired in NCAA trouble and banned from
playing in a bowl, beat Middle Tennessee last week by only five
points, 39-34. Giving up 183 and four touchdowns on the ground
doesn't bode well for a defense preparing to try to slow Quentin
Griffin, who ran for 237 yards against Tulsa.</TE>
<TE>   Oklahoma update: The Sooners have a great defense and a formidable
running game, but quarterback looks like a problem. Jason White
passed for only 126 yards with two interceptions in a 37-0 victory
over Tulsa.</TE>
<TE>   Story line: Alabama has won 12 national championships and Oklahoma
seven. This game would be better if the Sooners were playing a
Crimson Tide team of the past.</TE>
<TE>   The pick: Oklahoma. The defense and running game can carry the
team for now.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   No. 19 Colorado State (2-0)</TE>
<TE>   at UCLA (0-0)</TE>
<TE>   Kickoff: 7:15 p.m. TV: Fox Sports Net. Line: UCLA by 7.</TE>
<TE>   Colorado State update: The Rams already have beaten Virginia and
upset Colorado, 19-14, earning a top-25 ranking. A victory over UCLA
would turn them into upstart darlings. Cecil Sapp is averaging 130
yards rushing and quarterback Bradlee Van Pelt is a veteran leader.</TE>
<TE>   UCLA update: There are a lot of changes in personnel, but after
last season ended under the shadow of injuries and tailback DeShaun
Foster's suspension, the Bruins are ready to start over.</TE>
<TE>   Story line: The Bruins try to redeem themselves. Cory Paus would
rather be remembered for his passing than his drunk-driving arrests,
and Coach Bob Toledo needs to reestablish a perception that he has
the program under control.</TE>
<TE>   The pick: UCLA. It isn't the start of the season that gives the
Bruins so much trouble; it's the end.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Purdue (1-0)</TE>
<TE>   at No. 23 Notre Dame (1-0)</TE>
<TE>   Kickoff: 10 a.m. TV: Channel 4. Line: Notre Dame by 6.</TE>
<TE>   Purdue update: The Boilermakers opened with a 51-10 victory over
Illinois State, a Division I-AA team. Notre Dame is traditional
trouble. Purdue has lost to the Irish 57 times--more than any other
school but Navy--and Notre Dame has won 14 of the last 16 meetings.</TE>
<TE>   Notre Dame update: After upsetting Maryland in his debut, 22-0,
Coach Tyrone Willingham might soon be known not for the color of his
skin but the content of his playbook. Turns out option quarterback
Carlyle Holiday can throw the ball: He passed for a career-high 226
yards as Willingham introduced Notre Dame fans to the West Coast
offense.</TE>
<TE>   Story line: Enthusiasm for the Irish--and Willingham--will swell
if Notre Dame wins again.</TE>
<TE>   The pick: Notre Dame. Now, if only Penn State could turn things
around ...</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Stanford (0-0)</TE>
<TE>   at Boston College (1-0)</TE>
<TE>   Kickoff: 12:30 p.m. TV: ESPN2. Line: Boston College by 8.</TE>
<TE>   Stanford update: Quarterback Chris Lewis is suspended for the game
for what the school is calling a minor NCAA violation. Freshman Kyle
Matter will start. It's also the debut of Coach Buddy Teevens.</TE>
<TE>   Boston College update: Boston College had a little trouble
with--yikes!--Connecticut before winning, 24-16. The Eagles fell
behind, 16-3, against a team in its first full-fledged Division I
season.</TE>
<TE>   Story line: Starting a rookie quarterback on the road isn't the
best formula for a coaching debut. "Some would worry about a redshirt
freshman coming in without a lot of experience, but [Matter] is the
type of guy who can handle it," Teevens said.</TE>
<TE>   The pick: Boston College. As little faith as Boston College
deserves, it's too difficult to pick a rookie quarterback and a new
coach in a road debut.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   San Diego State (0-1)</TE>
<TE>   at No. 17 Colorado (0-1)</TE>
<TE>   Kickoff: 4 p.m. TV: Fox Sports Net. Line: Colorado by 23.</TE>
<TE>   San Diego State update: The Aztecs had a good shot at upsetting
Fresno State last week, but Tommy Kirovski's 31-yard field-goal
attempt was blocked as time expired and Fresno State hung on, 16-14.
It wasn't a bad coaching debut for Tom Craft, a former Aztec
quarterback.</TE>
<TE>   Colorado update: After a loss to Colorado State, with USC and UCLA
next, the Buffaloes badly need to win this game. They're favorites,
but a loss to San Diego State--fresh off three consecutive losing
seasons under Ted Tollner--would be humiliating.</TE>
<TE>   Story line: Two 0-1 teams meet, and somebody's season is in
trouble. Plus, it's another nice scouting opportunity for USC and
UCLA.</TE>
<TE>   The pick: Colorado. Nobody goes from No. 7 in the nation to 0-2,
right?</TE>

<HD>It's a Flop by U.S. Against Yugoslavia</HD>
<DH>Basketball: NBA stars suffer second loss in a row, 81-78,
and won't medal at World Championship.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>J.A. ADANDE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>INDIANAPOLIS</DL>
<LD>It was like a pitcher giving up a home run one batter after losing a
no-hitter.</LD>
<LD>   The United States men's basketball team had less than one day to
recover from its first loss with NBA players before it had to adjust
to a new disappointment: a two-game losing streak.</LD>
<LD>   Yugoslavia upset the United States, 81-78, in the quarterfinals of
the World Basketball Championship at Conseco Fieldhouse on Thursday
night.</LD>
<TE>   "We definitely made history," U.S. forward Ben Wallace said. "It
wasn't the type of history we wanted to make, but we definitely made
history."</TE>
<TE>   The United States had won its first 58 games since NBA players
joined the national teams in 1992. That streak ended with a
second-round loss to Argentina on Wednesday, but the only thing that
it cost was pride.</TE>
<TE>   Thursday's loss to Yugoslavia knocked the Americans out of medal
contention (they'll play Puerto Rico in a fifth-place semifinal
tonight).</TE>
<TE>   It also removed the last remnants of mystique about American
basketball, demonstrating that the earlier loss was no fluke. And it
is sure to bring calls for the top-level NBA players to answer their
country's call in international competition.</TE>
<TE>   While this team could have used Tim Duncan, Kevin Garnett or Allen
Iverson, for example, the two missing superstars mentioned the most
happened to be Lakers: Shaquille O'Neal and Kobe Bryant.</TE>
<TE>   Bryant's snubs of the U.S. national team have miffed NBA
higher-ups because he never has played for them in international
competition. O'Neal has played for the U.S. twice since he joined the
NBA: in the 1994 World Championship and 1996 Olympics. In addition,
he has spent this summer debating and awaiting surgery on his
arthritic right big toe.</TE>
<TE>   Other players who cited injuries for missing this team included
Jason Kidd and Ray Allen.</TE>
<TE>   But the group USA Basketball put together still included three NBA
All-Stars (Paul Pierce, Baron Davis and Elton Brand), the league's
defensive player of the year (Wallace) and most improved player
(Jermaine O'Neal). It wasn't enough to beat teams that had better
cohesion, more familiarity with the international rules, plus a few
NBA players of their own--Yugoslavia's team featured Vlade Divac and
Peja Stojakovic of the Sacramento Kings and Marko Jaric, who signed
to play with the Clippers this summer.</TE>
<TE>   The United States doesn't have the edge in stars anymore. Only in
superstars.</TE>
<TE>   "You've got to see that the best basketball players in the world
are not here, like Shaq and Kobe and all of those guys," said
Germany's Dirk Nowitzki, who plays for the Dallas Mavericks. "If they
would be here, it would be easy for the U.S."</TE>
<TE>   Will this disappointing showing be the slap in the face to bring
the superstars?</TE>
<TE>   "To tell you the truth, I hope it is," Pierce said. "All of these
other countries, they're bringing their best. We brought a team over
here that was some of our best, but we didn't bring the players that
obviously everybody was looking forward to see: the Shaqs, the Kobes.</TE>
<TE>   "But hopefully this will be a call for these guys to come out and
represent in the Olympics, where we can bring our best, our
superstars. This is a young team. The players on this team are on the
verge of being superstars in the league and are still trying to
establish themselves."</TE>
<TE>   Pierce has played at a superstar level at times during this
tournament. After Yugoslavia outplayed the United States in the first
half, Pierce put together a 14-point third quarter that helped give
the Americans a 10-point lead.</TE>
<TE>   They enjoyed a 10-point cushion with six minutes left in the game
before Milan Gurovic made back-to-back three-pointers to spark a 12-2
run that evened the score at 71 with 2:09 remaining.</TE>
<TE>   Jaric made the three-pointer that tied the game, and made four
free throws in the final 23 seconds to preserve Yugoslavia's lead
that was established with three free throws and another three-pointer
by Gurovic.</TE>
<TE>   Yugoslavia had better ball movement, a better low-post game and
better defense for the majority of the game. It outrebounded the
U.S., 40-29. All of that made up for a so-so shooting night (39.7%)
Divac scored 16 points in the first half, but didn't score in the
second. The team picked up for him, and displayed better fundamentals
than the Americans.</TE>
<TE>   While Yugoslavia made its last six free throws, O'Neal missed four
in the last 6:15. And the team seemed uncertain of what it wanted to
do, where it wanted to go on offense. Andre Miller, the point guard,
took three three-pointers in the final quarter, while Pierce got only
one shot--a three-pointer. They both finished with 19 points.</TE>
<TE>   "Late in the game we went to a lot of one-on-one," Reggie Miller
said. "What really got us that 10-point lead, we discontinued."</TE>
<TE>   This will mark the fifth time the United States has failed to win
a medal in the 14 World Championship events.</TE>
<TE>   The United States has endured losing streaks in World Championship
play before, dropping three in a row in 1970. It once had to use the
Athletes in Action traveling team because a late World Championship
coincided with the college school year. After the move to pro
players, an NBA lockout forced the U.S. to send a bunch of no-names
to the 1998 championship.</TE>
<TE>   But this was an NBA team, filled with recognizable names, and it
couldn't get the job done.</TE>
<TE>   "Those guys represent the U.S., they're all all-star players,
leaders on their own teams," said Stojakovic, who led all scorers
with 20 points. "It was a great thing for us to beat them. We were
not that big a names like they are. We showed what a team is."</TE>

<HD>Rodriguez Joins 50-50 Homer Club</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>On a night when he joined a prolific list of sluggers, Alex Rodriguez
also showed his skill at bartering.</LD>
<LD>   Rodriguez hit two home runs to become the first player in the
majors to reach 50 this season, and three of his teammates also
connected as the Texas Rangers cruised past the Baltimore Orioles,
11-2, Thursday night at Baltimore.</LD>
<LD>   Rodriguez, who hit 52 last year, is the fifth player in major
league history to have successive 50-homer seasons. He follows Babe
Ruth, Mark McGwire, Sammy Sosa and Ken Griffey Jr.</LD>
<TE>   The $252-million shortstop managed to get hold of the ball that
gave him 50 for the season, working a slick deal with the fan who
caught it.</TE>
<TE>   "A ball and a bat. Not bad at all," Rodriguez said. "I'll take
that every day."</TE>
<TE>   Rodriguez was even more pleased with his accomplishment, although
he wistfully wondered how nice it would have been if the Rangers,
last in the American League West, were vying for the playoffs.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm proud of 50 home runs in back-to-back years. It's a thrill,"
he said. "It's kind of bittersweet because you're doing it in a
situation where the team isn't excelling and doing great things.
Still, a lot of the preparation and work ethic pays off."</TE>
<TE>   Rodriguez homered twice against Jason Johnson, hitting a two-run
drive in the first inning and a solo shot in the third. It was his
ninth multihomer game of the season and the 29th of his career.</TE>
<TE>   Carl Everett, Todd Hollandsworth and Michael Young homered in a
five-run fifth inning to give Texas an 11-1 lead.</TE>
<TE>   Texas has homered in a team-record 23 straight games, two short of
the major league record. Rodriguez has accounted for 13 of the
Rangers' 47 homers during the streak.</TE>
<TE>   Rodriguez drove in three runs to boost his major league-leading
total to 124. The last player to lead the majors in homers and RBIs
in the same season was Cecil Fielder in 1991.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Toronto 5, Boston 4--Josh Phelps hit two home runs and Justin
Miller won his third consecutive decision to help the Blue Jays win
at Boston. The Red Sox lost for the seventh time in 11 games. Phelps
hit solo homers off John Burkett in the fourth and sixth innings and
added a tiebreaking double in the seventh off Dustin Hermanson (1-1).</TE>
<TE>   The Red Sox scored two runs in the ninth on a passed ball by Ken
Huckaby and an RBI double by Carlos Baerga. Kelvim Escobar recovered
to retire Johnny Damon on a fly out to center with the tying run on
second base, earning his 29th save.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Cleveland 11, Chicago 6--Karim Garcia hit a grand slam and Jim
Thome added a two-run homer for the Indians at Chicago.</TE>
<TE>   Trailing 3-2, the Indians took the lead with a six-run fifth
inning. Ellis Burks hit a two-run single to give the Indians a 4-3
lead. The White Sox had a chance to get out of the inning with a
double play, but shortstop Jose Valentin bobbled Thome's grounder,
allowing all runners to advance and load the bases for Garcia. Mike
Porzio relieved and allowed Garcia's third career grand slam.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   New York 9, Detroit 3--Raul Mondesi homered, doubled and drove in
three runs as the Yankees won at New York. Orlando Hernandez (8-4)
gave up three runs in seven innings, struck out seven and walked
none, and won for only the third time in 10 starts.</TE>
<TE>   Drew Henson, the former Michigan quarterback who is considered the
Yankees' third baseman of the future, made his major league debut as
a pinch-runner. He replaced Bernie Williams, who hit an RBI single in
the eighth.</TE>

<HD>Angels Pick On Little Devils</HD>
<DH>Baseball: Anderson has two homers, seven RBIs as team
solidifies position with 10-1 victory over Tampa Bay.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BILL SHAIKIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>ST. PETERSBURG, Fla.</DL>
<LD>Another day, another victory, and the Angels' playoff dream seems
tantalizingly close to reality.</LD>
<LD>   The Angels are not yet soliciting concession speeches from their
competition, but the air of confidence in the clubhouse is
unmistakable. Certainly, the obstacles standing between the Angels
and October baseball appear less imposing with each passing day.</LD>
<LD>   The Seattle Mariners? The invaluable Mark McLemore is hurt, and
the starting rotation includes the struggling Freddy Garcia, the
ailing Joel Pineiro and the unreliable Ismael Valdes. The Boston Red
Sox? Pedro Martinez is hurt, and the Sox have lost eight of their
past 12 games.</LD>
<TE>   The Angels? Garret Anderson hit two home runs and tied a career
high by driving in seven runs Thursday, in a 10-1 rout of the Tampa
Bay Devil Rays. The Angels won their seventh consecutive game,
jumping four games ahead of Seattle and 7 1/2 ahead of Boston in the
American League wild-card race.</TE>
<TE>   "We're in good shape for the wild card now," Angel outfielder Tim
Salmon said, "but things will really shake out in the next three
weeks."</TE>
<TE>   And the Angels have not conceded the division championship to the
rampaging Oakland Athletics. All that 20 consecutive victories have
gotten them is a modest three-game lead over the Angels--the smallest
of any division leader in the majors--and don't think the A's haven't
noticed.</TE>
<TE>   "That's one of the most amazing parts of all this," pitcher Barry
Zito told reporters in Oakland. "We've been the hottest team in
years, and we're still one bad series away from second place."</TE>
<TE>   That's because this year's Angels do not resemble the many
predecessors that self-destructed in September.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels lost 19 of their last 21 games last season, and they
posted a winning record once in the previous nine Septembers, but
they're 4-0 this September.</TE>
<TE>   And, with a three-game sweep of the Devil Rays in which they
outscored the worst team in the majors, 24-5, the Angels again served
notice that they would take no team for granted.</TE>
<TE>   "We're beating the teams we're supposed to beat," Salmon said. "We
could always go toe-to-toe with the big boys, but in the past we
would fall short against the teams we should beat."</TE>
<TE>   This year, it is the Mariners and the Red Sox, not the Angels,
trying to hang on as injuries mount and depth evaporates. For the
Angels, Salmon and pitcher Dennis Cook returned from injury Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   "Everything about this season is really going against the grain of
what we've been used to the past five or six years," Salmon said.
"But it's not like we're getting breaks or we're getting lucky. We're
a good solid team."</TE>
<TE>   Said Anderson: "The other years, when I look back, we weren't good
enough. We were always trying to [scrape] together a starting
rotation. We had injuries. We had holes. We had inexperience."</TE>
<TE>   The depth and talent are impressive enough now that Anderson
described one of the finest nights of his career as him just chipping
in.</TE>
<TE>   "It just happened to be my turn," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Ramon Ortiz, Scot Shields and Cook combined on a six-hitter for
the Angels. In his past five starts, Ortiz is 3-0 with a 2.52
earned-run average.</TE>
<TE>   Cook, pitching for the first time since July 4, closed the game
with a perfect ninth inning. He is pitching despite a torn rotator
cuff that will require surgery after the season.</TE>
<TE>   That, Cook hopes, will be in November.</TE>
<TE>   And, quietly, there are signs of October popping up throughout the
Angel organization.</TE>
<TE>   The ticket office is preparing to put playoff tickets on sale. The
coaching staff has adjusted the starting rotation so ace Jarrod
Washburn can face Oakland twice and Seattle twice in the final three
weeks, putting him in position to start the first or second game of a
playoff series.</TE>
<TE>   And Cook, the team elder at 39, can smell October.</TE>
<TE>   "I feel," he said, "like I'm on a one-month tryout to make the
playoff roster."</TE>

<DL>ST. PETERSBURG, Fla.</DL>
<LD>Another fad is spreading east from California: The rally monkey was
spotted in Iowa the other day.</LD>
<LD>   With the Midwest League playoffs starting this week, the Angels'
Class-A Cedar Rapids affiliate asked the folks in Anaheim to send
along video clips of the Angels' lucky leaping monkey. In their first
home playoff game Wednesday, the Kernels let the monkey loose on the
scoreboard in Cedar Rapids.</LD>
<LD>   "The majority of the people didn't really get it," the Kernels'
director of marketing, Mike Koolbeck, said Thursday. "But the players
all knew about it."</LD>
<TE>   The Cedar Rapids fans did not need to understand the power of the
rally monkey in order to experience it. The Kernels came from behind
in the seventh inning and again in the 10th before winning in the
12th. First baseman Casey Kotchman, the Angels' top prospect, singled
home the winning run, sending the Kernels into the league semifinals.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   If he had a ballot for most valuable player, the Angels' Garret
Anderson said he would vote for Alex Rodriguez of the Texas Rangers.
Angel Manager Mike Scioscia said Anderson merits consideration, but
Anderson said he believes the award should go to Rodriguez, even if
he plays for a last-place team, because he has produced the most
impressive statistics.</TE>
<TE>   "That's my definition of what an MVP is," Anderson said.</TE>
<TE>   Anderson is hitting .311 with 23 home runs; he ranks fourth in the
league with 108 runs batted in. Rodriguez is hitting .315 and leads
the majors with 50 homers and 124 RBIs.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   If he had a ballot for manager of the year, Scioscia said he would
vote for Oakland's Art Howe, in part because the A's overcame the
loss of Jason Giambi, Jason Isringhausen and Johnny Damon to free
agency and in part because the A's overcame a rocky start.</TE>
<TE>   But, because the Angels got off to the worst start in franchise
history, shouldn't Scioscia consider himself worthy? "Our guys have
played well. I'm not going to take the credit for that," he said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   By coincidence, Aug. 30 was the date players set as a strike
deadline as well as the date the Angels set for season-ticket holders
to pay in full for tickets for potential playoff games. Even with the
threat of a strike, more than 75% of season-ticket holders paid, with
money still coming in. The Angels are expected to announce
information about playoff ticket sales for the general public
shortly.... The A's open a three-game series in Minnesota tonight. If
they sweep, they will try to tie and break the major league record
for consecutive victories--26--in Anaheim next week.</TE>

<KH>AROUND THE MAJORS</KH>
<HD>Owners Ratify Agreement</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Baseball owners approved their new labor contract quickly and
overwhelmingly, voting 29-1 Thursday in Chicago to ratify the deal
negotiators struck last week to avert a strike.</LD>
<LD>   The New York Yankees, the team that stands to lose the most, voted
against the agreement, which ensures labor peace until December 2006.
Approval by the executive board of the union is considered certain.</LD>
<LD>   "I'm not going to suggest to you today that there are not clubs
with very different views, but at some point you have to come
together," Commissioner Bud Selig said after the two-hour meeting,
flanked by his chief negotiators, Bob DuPuy and Rob Manfred.</LD>
<TE>   "I told you last Friday I was a Yogi Berra theorist--'It ain't
over until it's over.' It's over."</TE>
<TE>   But baseball's turmoil might not be.</TE>
<TE>   The Yankees are considering a lawsuit, and owners must resolve the
uncertain status of the Montreal Expos, who could try to move to
Washington or another city by next season. Expo President Tony
Tavares wants to know within 10 days whether the team will stay or
explore a move.</TE>
<TE>   Selig had spent a great deal of time on the telephone with owners
to develop a consensus for the labor agreement, and he approved the
final moves made by his negotiators last week. The near-unanimous
vote was a sign of support he has among the owners.</TE>
<TE>   The Yankees, who generate the most money in baseball, estimate the
annual amount they give up to other clubs will increase from $28
million in 2001 to between $50 million and $55 million next year. The
team's lawyers have been examining grounds for a lawsuit.</TE>
<TE>   Yankee President Randy Levine declined to comment after the
meeting.</TE>
<TE>   Kansas City Royal owner David Glass said during the meeting that
the agreement was only a start to reforming baseball's economics,
according to one baseball official at the session, who spoke on
condition of anonymity.</TE>
<TE>   "It doesn't solve things, but it improves them," Glass said before
leaving the hotel at O'Hare International Airport. "It makes things
better, but not where we'd like to be. The main thing is we didn't
have a work stoppage. That's the big plus."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The two most important home run balls Barry Bonds has hit--No. 73
of last year and No. 600 of his career--continued their trip through
court, when separate lawsuits over who owns each ball were allowed to
proceed.</TE>
<TE>   In Fairfield, 40 miles northeast of where Bonds plays for the San
Francisco Giants, a judge agreed to put the 600th home run ball under
lock and key.</TE>
<TE>   Also, a San Francisco judge decided to postpone until today his
decision whether to dismiss the case on the ball for No. 73. Both
parties, who claim legal possession of the ball, will be in court to
restate their case, but chances are that the case will go to trial
next month.</TE>

<LD>Miami defensive tackle Matt Walters should feel right at home when
the Hurricanes play the Florida Gators on Saturday. He has been
wresting real alligators since high school.</LD>
<LD>   Walters grapples gators near his hometown of Eau Gallie, Fla. He
told the Bloomberg News Service he goes out in a small boat with his
brother and friends and they scan the surface of the water with a
spotlight, looking for the eyes and snouts of alligators.</LD>
<LD>   "Then we just grab them, one at the tail and one behind the back
of the neck and drag them into the boat," Walters said. "We hold them
up, take a picture and let them go. Sometimes they get loose in the
boat, though, which can be a little nerve-racking."</LD>
<TE>   Trivia time: When did USC play its first night football game?</TE>
<TE>   Elite group: Fortune magazine has published a list of the 40
richest people under age 40. Tiger Woods, at 26, has the distinction
of being the richest youngest member with earnings of $212 million.</TE>
<TE>   Shaquille O'Neal, 30, has earnings of $171 million. Michael Jordan
tops Tiger and Shaq with earnings of $408 million. But, at 39, he
won't be on the list next year.</TE>
<TE>   Organization man: Marv Goux, longtime USC assistant football coach
who died July 27, was extremely organized, according to Dave Levy,
who served 16 years on the USC coaching staff with Goux.</TE>
<TE>   Speaking at Goux's memorial service, Levy said: "He was an
extremely meticulous guy about his person, about his house, about his
cars, everything. His closets were notched so that the hangers were
all three inches apart.</TE>
<TE>   "And the shoes were all stuffed with shoe trees and tied with the
heels facing out, arranged by color. Everything was arranged by
color."</TE>
<TE>   Is Max in hiding? Mike Bianchi of the Orlando Sentinel recalls the
time he interviewed recruiting guru Max Emfinger when Emmitt Smith
was coming out of high school in Florida.</TE>
<TE>   Said Emfinger: "Emmitt Smith is not big, he's not fast and he
can't get around the corner. When he falls flat on his face at
Florida, remember where you heard it first."</TE>
<TE>   Bianchi: "Smith did not fall on his face at Florida. And the
Dallas Cowboys running back probably will become the NFL's all-time
leading rusher this season, surpassing the great Walter Payton."</TE>
<TE>   Food for thought: Dwight Perry in the Seattle Times: "If the
Sonics sign Popeye Jones to take Vin Baker's roster spot, does this
mean that spinach will sub in for doughnuts at the team buffet?"</TE>
<TE>   More Perry: "How far Drew Bledsoe can take Buffalo this season
remains to be seen, but with an offensive line that averages 6-4 1/2
and 321 pounds, you have to admit that the Bills, at the very least,
look like a team of density."</TE>
<TE>   Looking back: On this day in 1995, Baltimore's Cal Ripken passed
Lou Gehrig's iron-man streak when he played in his 2,131st
consecutive game.</TE>
<TE>   Trivia answer: Oct 14, 1944, against St. Mary's Pre-Flight in
Fresno. The Trojans won, 6-0.</TE>
<TE>   And finally: From David Letterman's "Top Ten Reasons to Hold the
2012 Olympics in New York":</TE>
<TE>   * "Lot of junk lying around to use as javelins and shotputs and
stuff."</TE>
<TE>   * "Heavily polluted air cancels effects of illegal
performance-enhancing drugs."</TE>

<HD>Defibrillators Get to Heart of the Matter</HD>

<AU>LAUREN PETERSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Sitting in a golf cart, packed away in a case surrounded by medical
supplies, is a device Anaheim High football Coach Ben Haley hopes he
never has to use.</LD>
<LD>   It's an automated external defibrillator (AED), used in medical
emergencies to deliver potentially lifesaving electric shock waves to
the heart.</LD>
<LD>   The ability to operate an AED machine recently became one of
Haley's job requirements, but the veteran of nearly 30 years of
coaching isn't complaining. "I'd rather have it and not have to use
it than be in a situation where [I] need it and don't have it," he
said.</LD>
<TE>   Last year, schools in the Anaheim Union High School District were
among the first in Southern California to purchase AEDs for their
high school campuses. This fall, the Los Angeles Unified and Santa
Barbara school districts have followed suit, drawn by hopes the
machines might save students, teachers and sports fans stricken by
heart problems.</TE>
<TE>   The LAUSD, among the nation's largest public school systems, plans
to have at least one defibrillator on each of its 49 high school
campuses by the end of this year. That's the first phase of a
long-term plan for district-wide accessibility.</TE>
<TE>   The high schools are getting the units first because of the large
crowds drawn to some athletic events, a district official said.</TE>
<TE>   The district purchased 60 machines last year at a cost of
$168,000.</TE>
<TE>   "If we can save one child's life, or one adult's life, then it's
worth every penny," said Barbara Fiege, director of athletics for the
district.</TE>
<TE>   A portable AED is a miniature version of machines found in
hospitals, a computerized monitoring device with palm-sized electrode
chest pads to deliver the shock. It is used to stop, restart, then
regulate the heart in the event of ventricular fibrillation, a
chaotic or disorganized heart rhythm that could lead to cardiac
arrest.</TE>
<TE>   "It's kind of like rebooting your computer," said Bob Gayou, an
emergency room physician at Santa Barbara Cottage Hospital and a
member of the Santa Barbara chapter of the American Heart Assn.,
which has been providing some of the training to school personnel.</TE>
<TE>   The units are so easy to use, said Terry Elledge, girls' athletic
director at Harvard-Westlake High, that they are "sort of
idiot-proof."</TE>
<TE>   Voice instruction and visual prompts from a built-in, miniature
screen guide users through the process. Among the directives:</TE>
<TE>   "Analyzing heart rhythm; do not touch the patient."</TE>
<TE>   "Shock advised." Or, "No shock advised."</TE>
<TE>   "Stay clear of patient."</TE>
<TE>   "Deliver shock now."</TE>
<TE>   The machine is designed to offer instruction because, "In those
kind of situations people sometimes can freak out, and the simplest
things, people still forget," said Ben Cardona, athletic trainer at
North Hollywood Harvard-Westlake. "When somebody may be dying in
front of you, that little prompt is exactly what you need."</TE>
<TE>   The LAUSD's units are being distributed as training takes place on
each of the campuses. So far, nurses, athletic directors, selected
administrators and all coaches at 13 district high schools have been
trained.</TE>
<TE>   In Santa Barbara, defibrillators will soon be available at Dos
Pueblos, San Marcos and Santa Barbara highs in the first phase of a
three-year program that is expected to include seven other high
schools.</TE>
<TE>   Each of the Anaheim district's nine high schools had one machine
last year, and this year will have two--one of them specifically
designated for athletics. Among private schools, Harvard-Westlake,
Los Angeles Cathedral, West Hills Chaminade, North Hollywood Campbell
Hall and Pasadena Poly have, or soon will have, the laptop-sized
units.</TE>
<TE>   Southern California schools are following New York's lead in
bringing defibrillators to campuses. New York earlier this week
became the first state with a law requiring each public school to
have an AED and trained staff members available at all athletic
events.</TE>
<TE>   The legislation was inspired by the death of 14-year-old Louis
Acompora, a Northport High lacrosse player, at a match in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   For local coaches, it is another responsibility--but a welcomed
one. Said Garfield football Coach Lorenzo Hernandez: "It's something
that's another tool in your first-aid toolbox."</TE>

<HD>Dodgers' Playoff Hopes Remain Right on Schedule</HD>
<DH>Baseball: L.A. has played well against top teams in league,
but looming at the end are pesky Padres.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE DiGIOVANNA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Dodgers have thrived during a crucial 18-game stretch in which
they're playing first-place Atlanta and Arizona, and wild-card
contending San Francisco and Houston, having won eight of the first
12 games against teams that are a combined 328-230.</LD>
<LD>   And if they emerge from the next two-week stretch, in which they
play the Giants seven times, with their National League wild-card
lead intact, the Dodgers would seem to have a clear path toward their
first playoff berth since 1996. Their final nine games are against
lowly Colorado and San Diego, which are a combined 123-157.</LD>
<LD>   But Dodger first baseman Eric Karros looks at the Rockies and
Padres at the end of the schedule and thinks: Where are the Braves
and Diamondbacks when you really need them?</LD>
<TE>   "I'd rather be playing a lot of other teams besides San Diego,"
Karros said. "Historically, we've always had trouble against the
Padres. They play us tough, they always get up for us, and if it
means throwing a wrench into our season, they'll pull out all the
stops.</TE>
<TE>   "To say [the teams we're playing now] is the tough part of the
schedule is not right. Every game the rest of the season is
important. When you play teams like Colorado and San Diego, there's a
lot to lose. Those games are just as tough."</TE>
<TE>   History supports Karros. The Dodgers, who open a three-game series
against the Astros tonight before traveling to San Francisco and
Colorado next week, have lost several division titles because they
failed to beat teams they were expected to beat--or failed to beat
the Padres--in the final weeks of the season.</TE>
<TE>   In 1996, the Dodgers needed one victory during a season-ending
series against San Diego to clinch the NL West title, but the Padres
swept three games and won it themselves. The Dodgers advanced to the
playoffs as a wild-card team but were swept by Atlanta in the
division series.</TE>
<TE>   In 1991, the Dodgers were tied for first place on Oct. 1 but lost
their next three games to the Padres and a sub-.500 Giant team,
finishing one game behind the Braves for the division championship.</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers were in first place on Sept. 19, 1982, before losing
eight straight--two games to the Padres, three to the Giants, two to
a Cincinnati Reds' team that went 61-101 and one to the Braves, who
won the division title.</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers were in first place on Aug. 31, 1973, before losing
nine straight--three to Houston, three to San Francisco, and three to
an awful San Diego team that finished 60-102--falling into second,
where they finished.</TE>
<TE>   And in 1971, after having won eight straight and going from eight
games back on Sept. 5 to one behind on Sept. 14, the Dodgers stumbled
twice to another 100-loss Padre team and finished one game behind San
Francisco in the division.</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers played so poorly in San Diego from 1978-80, going 7-20
in Jack Murphy Stadium, that then-general manager Al Campanis forbade
families from traveling south with the team for several years because
he felt they were a distraction to the players.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't care if you're playing the Brewers, the Cubs or the Mets,
it doesn't matter," Dodger outfielder Marquis Grissom said. "There's
no such thing as an easy game this time of year. There's no smooth
sailing.</TE>
<TE>   "When I played with Milwaukee [from 1998-2000] we wanted to make
sure Cincinnati didn't go to the playoffs. That's the attitude you
have to have when you're on the other team. Guys are still trying to
put up numbers, they're still competing."</TE>
<TE>   Teams no longer in contention usually play a lot of September
call-ups, players who haven't been scouted as much as big leaguers
and are difficult to prepare for.</TE>
<TE>   An even bigger threat to contenders in September: An established
team with a potent offense that has been eliminated from the playoff
hunt, is playing for pride or for future contracts and has nothing to
lose.</TE>
<TE>   Recent example: When Seattle and Oakland were battling for the
American League West title in September 2000, neither wanted anything
to do with the Angels, who had four players--Troy Glaus, Mo Vaughn,
Garret Anderson and Tim Salmon--with at least 34 homers and a center
fielder, Darin Erstad, who was en route to a 240-hit, 25-homer,
100-RBI season.</TE>
<TE>   That's why it's difficult to handicap the NL West and wild-card
races with three weeks left.</TE>
<TE>   Arizona, which has a 5 1/2-game lead over the Dodgers, appears to
have the easiest schedule. Only six of the Diamondbacks' final 22
games are against teams with winning records, and three are against
Milwaukee, which has the league's worst record.</TE>
<TE>   Their remaining opponents have a cumulative winning average of
.472, and Manager Bob Brenly can start Randy Johnson and Curt
Schilling in nine of those remaining games if he decides to shuffle
his rotation around days off.</TE>
<TE>   Of the Dodgers' 23 remaining games, 10 are against teams with
winning records, including seven against their long-time nemeses and
closest wild-card pursuers, the Giants, who trail the Dodgers by
three games after losing, 8-5, to the Diamondbacks on Thursday night.</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers' remaining opponents have a .493 winning average, but
seven of the Dodgers' final nine games, including a season-ending
four-game series in Los Angeles, are against the stubborn Padres, who
have won five of the last six season series with the Dodgers.</TE>
<TE>   San Francisco appears to have the toughest road to the playoffs,
with 13 of its final 22 games against teams with winning records. The
Giants' opponents have a cumulative .503 winning average.</TE>
<TE>   Like Arizona, San Francisco plays Milwaukee three times, but
whereas the Dodgers close the season against the Padres, the Giants
finish with three games against Houston, 7 1/2 games off the
wild-card pace.</TE>
<TE>   Though the Astros' playoff chances seem dim, they could climb back
in the race with a sweep of the Dodgers this weekend, and they have
six games left with Milwaukee.</TE>
<TE>   But Houston also must play NL Central-leading St. Louis seven
times.</TE>
<TE>   "No one knows who's going to win the West or the wild card,"
Dodger third baseman Adrian Beltre said.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it's going to go all the way to the end."</TE>

<LD>Warren Anderson always seemed to come away from the first few days of
football practice with a headache. He thought it was a natural
reaction as he adjusted to the contact each season.</LD>
<LD>   Until this summer.</LD>
<LD>   In two weeks on the Ventura St. Bonaventure High practice field,
Anderson hasn't heard ringing in his ears, an improvement he
attributes to his "Revolution"--a newly designed helmet by Riddell,
the nation's largest manufacturer of adult football helmets.</LD>
<TE>   "I'm definitely sold on it," said Anderson, a 6-foot-4, 250-pound
defensive end. "I would never go back to the old ones as long as
these are around."</TE>
<TE>   About two ounces lighter than a traditional helmet, but with an
extended lower portion, called the mandible, that protects the jaw,
the Revolution has drawn largely rave reviews from local players and
coaches.</TE>
<TE>   Thad Ide, vice president of research and product development for
Riddell, said the Revolution's shell represents the first major
structural change in helmet design in more than 25 years--since
air-fit systems were introduced in the 1970s.</TE>
<TE>   Four years in the making, it was designed with the goal of
reducing concussions. It is conservatively estimated that football is
responsible for nearly 100,000 concussions a year, from youth to
professional levels. Ide said it's hoped the new helmet may be able
to reduce concussions by 30%.</TE>
<TE>   "It's priceless if it can reduce [concussions] by 30%," said St.
Bonaventure Coach Jon Mack, whose program bought 20 of the new
helmets. "We [initially] bought 15 standard and 14 Revolutions, and
the way they've taken off I can see us ordering strictly Revolutions
in the future. I figured the worst thing is that I'd have 14 helmets
on the shelf, [but] our guys liked them so much we picked up another
six."</TE>
<TE>   St. Bonaventure, Moorpark, Lakewood, Westlake Village Westlake and
West Covina South Hills are among area schools that purchased at
least 18 of the new helmets, according to Riddell. Schools typically
replace 20% to 25% of their helmets each year.</TE>
<TE>   In a study partially funded by NFL Charities that began in 1997,
scientists at Biokinetics and Associates of Ottawa, Canada, analyzed
concussive hits to the head in professional football games and
attributed almost 70% to blows to the side, face or jaw area. That's
where Riddell concentrated its redesign.</TE>
<TE>   Riddell made the helmet wider to accommodate energy-absorbing
padding to the side of the head and extended the shell down the jaw
line to provide added protection for side-impact blows.</TE>
<TE>   "Traditional helmets don't offer a lot of protection to the side
of the face, and foam lining that did extend to the face area was
more for fitting purposes," Ide said.</TE>
<TE>   To retain proportion with a wider helmet, Riddell made the shell
about a quarter-inch bigger all the way around. There is increased
open area around the eyes for greater peripheral vision, and with six
elliptical top vents, the helmet is lighter than the standard model
even though it's made of the same material and protects more of the
head. The mandible also curves around the head's anatomical center of
gravity--about an inch above the ear line--to make it less strenuous
to wear.</TE>
<TE>   The cost of a Revolution on Riddell's Web site is $159.99, which
is $57 more than a standard model. About 25% of football-playing high
schools in the U.S. have purchased Revolutions, and Riddell expects
that total to double next year.</TE>
<TE>   Cody Holland, a Moorpark quarterback and free safety who has worn
another brand of helmet since he was 10, let curiosity get the better
of him when he tried on a Revolution at the beginning of summer
practice.</TE>
<TE>   "It changed my whole perspective," he said. "Having the protection
around the head and jaw, and the lightness of it, and feeling more
comfortable in it, I think it would be pretty difficult to go back."</TE>

<HD>The Security Blanket Goes Global</HD>
<DH>Olympics: Protection level for Israelis was forever changed
after Munich. Sept. 11 changed it for the world.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ALAN ABRAHAMSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>TEL AVIV</DL>
<LD>At the Sydney Olympic Games two years ago, the Israeli team had a
special fence around the compound where the athletes, including
sprinter Gideon Yablonka, stayed. "We were the only team with a fence
around our compound," he recalls.</LD>
<LD>   Anything that moved inside or outside the Israeli compound got
noticed. "We had video cameras all over triggered by sensors,"
Yablonka says. "If somebody moved, the cameras would go on with a
beep."</LD>
<LD>   There was muscle too, highly trained security guards at the ready,
with guns.</LD>
<TE>   Yablonka, 24, sighed. He said, "Not too many people like us. It's
problematic. But we really don't think about it. It's their job,"
that of security officials, "they'll think about it. My job is the
track meet. That's what I focus on, not whether someone is going to
come and blast me away, which--knock on wood--I hope is never going
to happen."</TE>
<TE>   Since the 1972 Munich Games, in which 11 Israeli athletes and
coaches were kidnapped by Palestinian terrorists and, ultimately,
killed, it has always been a special burden to be on the world stage
with the word "Israel" stitched into one's team jersey.</TE>
<TE>   Until the last year, that predicament was dismissed by many as
unique to Israeli sports teams.</TE>
<TE>   The terrorist attacks last Sept. 11 in the United States, however,
have forced Olympic and security officials worldwide to focus a
renewed intensity on potential threats.</TE>
<TE>   "Now it's the entire world," says one U.S. official, acknowledging
that American athletes and delegations are at increased risk:
"Obviously, 'USA' has taken on a whole new [meaning]. We realize that
terrorists have found where the United States is."</TE>
<TE>   Since Sept. 11, the official, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said, "We have to take a look at what we do on a day-to-day basis,
just as the Israelis have been doing. The way things have changed is
we realize it's no more that we're safe in our country and maybe not
safe in other countries."</TE>
<TE>   Security costs at the 2002 Salt Lake Winter Games topped more than
$300 million. The security tab at the 2004 Athens Summer Olympics is
currently estimated by Greek officials at about $600 million; some
security experts, however, say that bill may ultimately reach,
perhaps even top, $1 billion.</TE>
<TE>   Recent months, and escalating tensions around the world, have made
plain just how sensitive a task security can be. In Israel, the
issues have long been magnified.</TE>
<TE>   For instance, an athlete identified with any Israeli team
competing abroad goes through extensive security briefings before a
trip, is told not to wear identifying gear in free time, is sometimes
driven to practice and meets in armed convoys, is always on alert.</TE>
<TE>   "We wear [team gear] only at practice and games," said Shimon
Mizrahi, the longtime owner of the professional basketball team
Maccabi Tel Aviv. "If the players go walking in the streets, they
don't wear their colors."</TE>
<TE>   In May, FIFA, world soccer's governing body, was asked by various
Arab countries to ban Israel from the sport because of policies
toward Palestinians. Eight Arab soccer federations had requested
suspension of Israel, FIFA President Sepp Blatter said in announcing
that the requests had been denied. "We're not a political
organization," he said.</TE>
<TE>   That same month, a delegation from the Israeli Olympic Committee
traveled to Kuala Lumpur, and was issued a visa by the government
there--a moderate Muslim nation--only after intense pressure from a
senior International Olympic Committee official. Upon arrival, the
Israelis found that their flag was the only one of 199 from Olympic
committees around the globe not hanging from the ceiling of the hotel
ballroom where the meeting took place; the Palestinian flag was among
those displayed.</TE>
<TE>   A few weeks before the meeting in Malaysia, the head of Iran's
Olympic Committee, Mostafa Hashemi Taba, had urged International
Olympic Committee President Jacques Rogge to expel Israel from the
IOC. Rogge promptly rejected Hashemi Taba's call.</TE>
<TE>   Though Israeli delegations perhaps have more extensive experience
in dealing with the pressures of politics and sport,
others--including U.S. teams--have quickly learned over the last year
that they are not immune.</TE>
<TE>   Just days ago, the U.S. wrestling team pulled out of the world
freestyle championships in Iran after being warned by the U.S. State
Department of a threat; the nature and scope of the threat have not
been made public. The tournament began Thursday in Tehran.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. women's field hockey team arrived May 22 in New Delhi for
a World Cup qualifying tournament but left about a week later, after
the U.S. State Department advised the team to go home because of
mounting tension between India and Pakistan. The U.S.-India series
was finally played in June--at a neutral site, in Staffordshire,
England.</TE>
<TE>   Much of all of this can be traced back to Munich '72, where the
notion of sport as a respite from international politics and the
Games as an idyllic festival of universal brotherhood was shattered.
The rifts that were exposed then in the so-called "Olympic family,"
as Olympic officials like to refer to the enterprise, remain far from
healed, as a recent episode--again in Munich--make plain.</TE>
<TE>   A few weeks ago, the European track and field championships were
held in Munich, the first time the Israelis were to compete in
Olympic Stadium there since 1972. For the past several years, Israel
has been a member of the European Olympic Committees; even though
Israel is technically in Asia, it is not wanted in the Asian league,
whose leadership is dominated by Arabs.</TE>
<TE>   Several months before the meet in Munich, Israeli officials had
asked meet organizers to consider including at the meet, inside the
stadium, a formal commemoration of the 11 slain in 1972.</TE>
<TE>   The request was denied.</TE>
<TE>   In a May 24 letter to Israeli officials on the subject, Munich
organizers declared that "the momentary conflicts and the thereby
produced high sensibility and irritation in the public [would be] a
very high risk." They added that it was "surely" in the Israelis'
interests that the meet, the athletes, and fans were "not exposed to
a risk which cannot be justified."</TE>
<TE>   This much, organizers said, would have to do: "Our silent memory
of all the victims and the condemnation of the attack will be
permanently present during the European championships."</TE>
<TE>   The Israelis, finding this reasoning singularly unpersuasive and
unmoving, organized a ceremony of their own. About two dozen
relatives of those murdered, joined by the 17-member Israeli team,
observed a moment of silence and listened to songs and speeches at a
monument to the victims--a large stone placed at the bridge linking
the stadium to the former Olympic village.</TE>
<TE>   "You feel shivers when you close your eyes and think about the
terrible things that happened," distance runner Nili Abramski told
reporters. "But we had to come and show that even the most terrible
things won't stop us."</TE>
<TE>   "I think Israeli athletes are just like any athletes," sprinter
Yablonka said. "When you travel abroad, even at the Olympics, you
travel on the bus and, say, the Iranian athlete and coach are sitting
next to you. It's fine, nothing weird about it. It's actually pretty
nice. You feel weird at the beginning. But everyone's there for the
same reasons. No one's there to fight."</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps. But Israeli security protocol starts with a basic
assumption: never again.</TE>
<TE>   "Israel has gone a very, very long way from the 1972 Munich
massacre, and I can say it was a milestone in the way Israeli
security doctrine was built," said Jacob Perry, who headed the
Israeli internal security service, known by its Hebrew initials, Shin
Bet, from 1988-95.</TE>
<TE>   Since Munich, the Shin Bet service--there is no comparable U.S.
institution--has been responsible for securing Israeli athletes. Its
duties now are recognized as the protection of Israeli interests,
installations and delegations at home and abroad, everything from
sports teams to ballet dancers to government officials.</TE>
<TE>   In Israel, security now is also approached from another essential
assumption, one that centers on the nature of the threat. It has
changed considerably over the past 30 years.</TE>
<TE>   "Back in the 1970s, Palestinian terrorism was a secular
terrorism," says Shabtai Shavit, who headed the Mossad, the Israeli
secret service, from 1989-96. He explains: "It was a terrorism of
organizations that were secular by nature, political by nature, that
represented people who fought for their national freedom.</TE>
<TE>   "In those days, Israelis were marked as targets because they were
Israelis, not because they were Jews. Today it's a different ballgame
altogether. Today they are, and will be, marked because they are
Israelis and Jews."</TE>
<TE>   At the Munich track meet, more than 1,000 armed police provided
security for the event. Israeli athletes were escorted everywhere by
guards.</TE>
<TE>   During the Israeli-organized memorial ceremony, three police
helicopters circled in the sky, police sharpshooters atop nearby
bridge supports stood at the ready and the main local highway was
closed in both directions for several kilometers.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a bit scary at the beginning but the security is
unbelievable," Abramski told reporters. "The Germans are taking no
chances."</TE>
<TE>   If a Shin Bet delegation travels with an Israeli team, the issue
of whether the Shin Bet guards can carry guns on foreign soil can be
sensitive. The State Department has the responsibility for ensuring
"appropriate security," including "additional security" if need be,
for U.S. teams abroad.</TE>
<TE>   In late July, the Maccabi Haifa soccer team arrived at the local
airport for a flight to Cyprus, only to get stuck there for several
hours, denied permission to take off, while Israeli and Cypriot
officials worked out details allowing the arming of Shin Bet guards.
Israeli Foreign Minister Shimon Peres reportedly was called in to
help mediate.</TE>
<TE>   "They'll be wanting a little army traveling with them next," a
senior Cypriot official was quoted as saying in a Reuters dispatch
from Nicosia.</TE>
<TE>   The Maccabi Haifa team was to fly to Nicosia because UEFA, the
governing body for European soccer, had announced earlier this year
that Haifa and two other Israeli soccer teams would have to play
"home" games elsewhere. UEFA cited security concerns in the Mideast.</TE>
<TE>   Ultimately, Maccabi Haifa flew to Nicosia, to play Belshina
Bobruisk of Belarus. Maccabi won, 4-0. In the 22,000-seat stadium,
perhaps 50 fans saw the match; they were outnumbered, 10 to 1, by
armed police.</TE>
<TE>   That earned Maccabi Haifa another "home" match, on Aug. 13, in
Sofia, Bulgaria, against an Austrian team, Sturm Graz. Another tiny
crowd saw the Israelis win, 2-0.</TE>
<TE>   In March, after UEFA's no-games-in-Israel edict was issued, the
captain of Hapoel Tel Aviv, Shimon Gershon, said, "It is a bizarre
feeling to fly out of Israel for a match that you are supposed to
host. I wonder what will happen if we score a goal--will it count as
an away goal?"</TE>
<TE>   In Munich, Israeli pole vaulter Alex Averbukh won gold--Israel's
first gold medal in a major track meet. In Olympic Stadium, Averbukh
stood atop the podium and wiped away tears; in the stands, thousands
of track fans stood respectfully as the Israeli national anthem,
"Hatikvah," which means "The Hope," rang out.</TE>
<TE>   Distance runner Abramski said later, "We wanted to show that we
are even stronger--that we never give up. We know we are targets
everywhere we go. But you can't live in fear."</TE>

<LD>Relatives of the 11 Israeli athletes and officials killed in the
Munich Olympics massacre won't attend a 30th anniversary memorial
ceremony in Germany today, the eve of the Jewish New Year.</LD>
<LD>   "We're all single-parent families now," said Ankie Spitzer, widow
of fencer Andrei Spitzer. "We need to be here with our children."</LD>
<LD>   The ceremony is to be held at the military airfield near Munich
where on Sept. 5, 1972, German police launched their botched attempt
to free the hostages. The Israelis, a German policeman and five
Palestinian terrorists were killed.</LD>
<TE>   German Interior Minister Otto Schily, Israeli Ambassador Shimon
Stein and the president of the International Olympic Committee,
Jacques Rogge, plan to attend.</TE>

<HD>Malele Creates Own Memories</HD>
<DH>High schools: Senior defensive tackle, much like his
father, has developed into a standout at Carson.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ERIC STEPHENS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Malele Malele used to take his sons to the park to play tennis and
basketball. Football was something he didn't want to emphasize in
their lives.</LD>
<LD>   But brothers Mel and Matthew were reminded of the sport's role in
their father's life by the trophies displayed in their Carson home
and by the worn album of photos and newspaper clippings that
chronicled his exploits.</LD>
<LD>   They heard more stories from relatives and friends. And their love
for the game grew.</LD>
<TE>   "People would tell me how great a player my dad was," Matthew
Malele said. "They'd tell me that he was the hardest hitter in the
city."</TE>
<TE>   Matthew Malele has grown up to become much like his father on the
playing field. The senior defensive tackle is the centerpiece of a
Carson High team that is again expected to challenge for the City
Section championship.</TE>
<TE>   At 6 feet 2 and 300 pounds, he is considered the best at his
position in the City and one of the top recruits on the West Coast.
Coaches and scouts rave about his ability to shed blockers and get
into the backfield.</TE>
<TE>   Taft edged the Colts, 17-14, in last year's City quarterfinals en
route to a title-game appearance. But Taft Coach Troy Starr was so
impressed, he rated Malele with former Westchester High and
University of Washington standout Larry Tripplett as the best linemen
he had seen in his 11 years at the school. Tripplett was the
Indianapolis Colts' second-round draft pick in April.</TE>
<TE>   "We averaged 0.8 yards [per rush] on the ground that game," Starr
said. "That should say how good [Malele] is. He's a wall."</TE>
<TE>   Manuel Douglas is in his first season as coach at Harbor City
Narbonne after serving as offensive coordinator at Carson. He said he
isn't looking forward to designing a scheme to neutralize Malele when
the teams meet on Oct. 18.</TE>
<TE>   The reason Malele is so effective, Douglas says, is his footwork.</TE>
<TE>   "He's got the most explosive first two steps that I've ever seen,"
he said. "For a big man to move that fast is amazing. To be honest,
you run away from him."</TE>
<TE>   Malele showed off those talents on April 13 at the Nike Camp at
USC, where 370 college prospects from across the nation were
evaluated. His strength was obvious, but his 4.91 clocking in the
40-yard dash and 26.4-inch vertical leap caught the scouts'
attention.</TE>
<TE>   That helped cement his name at the top of recruiting lists at
several major colleges. USC, Stanford, UCLA and Washington have all
reportedly offered scholarships. He has a trip lined up for Tennessee
on Nov. 9, when the Volunteers play host to Miami. Both schools have
talked to him, as have Oregon, Notre Dame and Michigan State.</TE>
<TE>   "You feel good that a lot of schools want you," he said. "It shows
you that hard work pays off."</TE>
<TE>   Despite being selected to the Shrine all-star football game when
he was a senior, Malele Malele played only one year of junior college
football before giving up the game and starting a family. The elder
Malele and his wife, Cecilia, have always stressed education to their
children and it has paid off.</TE>
<TE>   Matthew Malele will have no worries meeting academic standards. He
has a 3.8 grade-point average and a 900 score on the SAT.</TE>
<TE>   "As parents, we're concerned about what's out there after four
years," Malele Malele said. "A lot of kids are obsessed with playing
in the big leagues, so the big thing we stressed with Matthew is he's
got to look at the long run. He's got to make sure that a school is
not only good for him for football but also good for him for his
future.</TE>
<TE>   "You can go to Oregon and still go to the pros. You can go to
Stanford and still go to the pros. All of these schools offer
different things."</TE>
<TE>   For now, Matthew Malele wants the experience of winning the City
title. In his two previous years on the varsity, the Colts have lost
in the title game and in the quarterfinals.</TE>
<TE>   "I want to at least have one ring," he said. "With the team we've
got, we can do it."</TE>

<LD>Jeff Gordon is hot and Rusty Wallace is hot under the collar.</LD>
<LD>   That combination could produce fireworks when NASCAR's Winston Cup
circuit hits Richmond International Speedway on Saturday night.</LD>
<LD>   The closest thing to a NASCAR feud, although both drivers deny
there is one, is the Gordon-Wallace bump-and-run rivalry.</LD>
<TE>   It all started years ago at Richmond when Wallace was passed by
Gordon, then almost immediately bumped Gordon, spinning him into the
wall. Wallace termed it just "a racing incident."</TE>
<TE>   Gordon remembers it differently.</TE>
<TE>   Two races ago, at Bristol--like Richmond a short track where
bumping and grinding are matters of fact--Gordon nudged Wallace two
laps from the finish as Gordon broke a 31-race losing streak. Gordon
also won last Sunday at Darlington.</TE>
<TE>   "What I did [at Bristol] was a lot different from what he did at
Richmond," Gordon said. "There's a difference between bumping a guy,
taking the air off a guy, or just flat-out wrecking him."</TE>
<TE>   NASCAR did not reprimand Gordon, but Wallace warned that the
bumping was something he would "file away in my memory bank."</TE>
<TE>   Gordon jokingly said that NASCAR's reaction gave Wallace a free
hand to return the favor without thinking twice about bumping.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know about that," Wallace said when told of Gordon's
remarks. "I like Jeff. Don't get me wrong, I like him a lot and I
just want to win, real, real bad. You know, I needed the win too.</TE>
<TE>   "I won't ever do anything to hurt a driver, but if I'm close
enough to win, he's going to get the bump too. It's gonna be fun.</TE>
<TE>   "I know everybody is on the edge of their seats and if I do bump
him and he does spin, they're gonna say it's a payback when it really
could have been just a racing accident.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't want anybody to think I would spin anybody out and wreck
him for a payback. If I get close enough to bump him and get past
him, I'll absolutely do that though."</TE>
<TE>   Stay tuned. It may not be a feud, but it should make for a great
show Saturday night on that three-quarter-mile bullring at Richmond,
Va.</TE>

<TE>   Indy Racing League</TE>
<TE>   Jaques Lazier, who won the IRL race at Chicagoland Speedway last
year, will be at the Chicago race Sunday, but not as a driver. Lazier
is still recuperating from a crash last April at Nazareth Speedway in
Pennsylvania, where his back was broken.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not coming back to [drive] any races this year," the Alta
Loma driver told the IRL's Dick Mittman. "I spoke to my doctors and
they said I could get back in a car but that if I have another crash
it could be detrimental to my career. It's difficult to say to them,
'You don't know what you're talking about.' "</TE>
<TE>   Lazier, 31, younger brother of 1996 Indianapolis 500 winner Buddy
Lazier, was in his second race with Team Menard in last year's
Chicago win. Since his injury, team owner John Menard has had several
drivers, winding up with young Brazilian Vitor Meira, the South
American Formula 3 champion two years ago.</TE>
<TE>   Menard has promised Lazier his ride back in 2003 and Lazier
expects to begin testing next month at Gateway Raceway, near St.
Louis.</TE>
<TE>   With only two races remaining, Chicagoland and the finale at Texas
Motor Speedway on Sept. 15, only one point separates the Team Penske
pair of series leader Helio Castroneves and Gil de Ferran. Defending
champion Sam Hornish Jr. is only eight points behind Castroneves.</TE>

<TE>   Although team owner Don Prudhomme suffered a double setback Monday
when two of his drivers, Larry Dixon in top fuel and Tommy Johnson
Jr. in funny car, lost in the U.S. National finals to Tony Schumacher
and John Force, the Snake got a bonus Sunday when his third driver,
Ron Capps, won his third Budweiser Funny Car Shootout in a Skoal
Chevy Camaro.</TE>
<TE>   "That was awesome," said Capps, who also won in 1998 and 1999. "I
can't believe we won this race again.</TE>
<TE>   "Obviously, we struggled at our last race, but I learned a long
time ago--and I learned it from Don Prudhomme--you just don't give up
on the people you believe in. The guys [on the crew] really worked
hard and we had some tough times."</TE>
<TE>   Capps had failed to qualify at the previous event at Brainerd,
Minn.</TE>

teammate, Rubens Barrichello, leads Juan Pablo Montoya by seven

<TE>   Malaysian Alex Yoong, one of Minardi's team drivers when the
season opened, will return to his seat after a two-race absence for
the Sept. 15 Grand Prix of Italy at Monza. Anthony Davidson of
England failed to finish in two races as Yoong's replacement.</TE>
<TE>   Yoong's return lessens chances for American Bryan Herta to drive
in the U.S. Grand Prix in Indianapolis on Sept. 29.</TE>
<TE>   "There is still some hope I could be in the car for Indy, but it
depends on how Alex does at Monza," Herta said from his home in
Valencia. "I'm still talking with them about next year, though, and I
have a two-day test planned after the season ends."</TE>
<TE>   Davidson, 23, and Nicky DeFazio, 18, who will drive in Saturday

<HD>Munich Terrorists Become Target of Israel's Wrath</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Alan Abrahamson</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Shortly after the murders of the 11 Israelis at the Munich Olympic
Games, the Israeli government set out on an extraordinary campaign of
retribution. Planned by a select group of Israeli officials called
"Committee X," the campaign, which has since become widely known as
"Operation Wrath of God," had but one simple, lethal goal:
Assassinate terrorists involved in the Munich massacre.</LD>
<LD>   Thirty years later, only one remains alive: Jamal al-Gashey, who
remains in hiding, somewhere in the Middle East. He was 19 in 1972,
one of the youngest of the eight Black September terrorists who
infiltrated the Olympic Village.</LD>
<LD>   The two other terrorists who survived the firefight at the
Furstenfeldbruck airport, Adnan al-Gashey and Mohammed Safedy, were
among those targeted and killed. Also executed by the Mossad,
Israel's secret service, or by Sayeret Matkal, an elite Israeli
military unit, were a number of others believed to be linked to the
attacks, including Ali Hassan Salameh, a key Palestinian figure
suspected of playing an instrumental role in planning the attacks.
Salameh, a close friend of Yasser Arafat's, was killed by a
remote-controlled car bomb in Beirut in 1979.</LD>
<TE>   The campaign also includes one highly publicized and enormous
mistake. In 1973, a Moroccan waiter, Ahmed Bouchiki, was gunned down
in front of his pregnant wife near a bus stop in Lillehammer, Norway;
he was mistakenly believed to be Salameh. In 1996, without accepting
responsibility for the killing, the Israeli government paid
compensation to Bouchiki's family.</TE>
<TE>   Israeli officials, current and former, have long declined to
confirm or deny any details of "Operation Wrath of God." Shabtai
Shavit, who from 1989-1996 headed the Mossad, would only say in an
interview, "It doesn't matter where a terrorist act is committed.
Israel is committed to defending its citizens all around the
world.... We never let it off, even in periods when we had other
items on our agenda that had priority."</TE>
<TE>   According to a number of accounts, in particular the book "One Day
in September," written by British author Simon Reeve and based in
part on research done for the Oscar-winning movie of the same name,
Golda Meir, Israel's prime minister in the early 1970s, authorized
the campaign.</TE>
<TE>   Meir acted after the three terrorists who survived the firefight
were flown to Libya just weeks after the Israelis were
killed--"exchanged" as part of a "hijacking" that, according to the
book, was in truth a deal agreed to by senior figures in the German
government to get the three terrorists out of Germany as quickly as
possible.</TE>
<TE>   That, said David Makovsky, a former executive editor of the
Jerusalem Post who is now a senior fellow at the Washington Institute
for Near East Policy, "only deepened a sense of isolation in Israel's
mind that it had to act--that no one would act on its behalf."</TE>
<TE>   The attack at the Games, Makovsky added, represented nothing less
than an "assault on Israel's normal place in the family of nations,"
adding that because to many Israelis the United Nations is seen as
sympathetic to Arab concerns, "what the family of nations represents
in the Israeli imagination is the Olympic Games. It's not the only
representation--but it's a prime representation."</TE>

<HD>A's, Angels Are Streaking, Standing Toe to Toe in West</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Ross Newhan</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>OAKLAND</DL>
<LD>So, the Oakland A's win when they trail by five runs, as they did in
their 19th consecutive victory, and they win even when they blow an
11-run lead, as they did in their 20th, and center fielder Terrence
Long wonders how long it will be before the pursuing Angels lose
heart.</LD>
<LD>   "We went through it last year," Long was saying after the A's set
an American League record for consecutive wins with their bizarre,
12-11 victory over Kansas City on Wednesday night.</LD>
<LD>   "We had a great second half [the second best ever], won 102 games
and still finished 14 games behind Seattle. It was deflating. The
Angels are playing great ball now, but we're playing great ball as
well. I'm sure they have to be feeling like we did last year."</LD>
<TE>   If the Angels are frustrated or deflated by their inability to
catch the A's in the American League West, it hasn't shown.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, the A's seem to talk so much about the Angels, could it
be that they're the ones a little frustrated or deflated by their
inability to put Anaheim away?</TE>
<TE>   Nonsense, insisted Manager Art Howe, who says he has a
professional team that "isn't looking at any other team and isn't
worried about any other team."</TE>
<TE>   At this point, in fact, it appears that both teams are headed for
the playoffs and the only real debate is which team wins the division
and which becomes the wild card, qualifying for the dubious privilege
of playing the New York Yankees in the first round.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels have bought into Manager Mike Scioscia's mantra of
playing one game at a time so thoroughly that they might not even
know the A's have won 20 in a row or that they have eight games left
against the A's, starting with a four-game series in Anaheim that
begins Monday.</TE>
<TE>   That's undoubtedly a stretch, but the point is that it has been
difficult to get the Angels, who have won seven in a row, to look at
the big picture when their focus is restricted, as it will be
tonight, to a series opener in Baltimore.</TE>
<TE>   Tony Gwynn, in Oakland Wednesday as an analyst on the ESPN
telecast, said he admires the way the Angels have gone about it and
would give Scioscia the edge over Howe as the AL's manager of the
year.</TE>
<TE>   "That's not to take anything away from Art Howe," Gwynn said. "He
lost Jason Giambi and Johnny Damon and he has one of the smallest
payrolls in baseball, but he also has a playoff-tested nucleus and a
team that won more than 100 games last year.</TE>
<TE>   "No one could have predicted the Angels would play as well as they
have when they signed Aaron Sele and Kevin Appier, including me, but
they bring a lot of focus, intensity and enthusiasm, and that's a
tribute to the manager."</TE>
<TE>   While the A's were flying to Minnesota on Thursday, the Angels
entered the finale of the Tampa Bay series having gone 14-6 during
the Oakland streak.</TE>
<TE>   They have remained in the race, three games behind the A's, while
the Mariners have shown signs of defaulting.</TE>
<TE>   In the aftermath of 116 wins and their historic season, the
Mariners have fallen seven games behind the A's and four behind the
Angels while going 8-12 and never winning more than two in a row
during the Oakland streak.</TE>
<TE>   Manager Lou Piniella has kept his cool, but at some point he may
reveal his true feelings to an ownership that, despite reaping vast
revenue in sold-out Safeco Field, tightened purse strings and failed
to address Piniella's second-half needs, unless you consider Jose
Offerman and Ismael Valdes significant additions.</TE>
<TE>   Now, Piniella probably will play the rest of the season without
Mark McLemore's versatility and clutch hitting. McLemore had elbow
surgery Thursday, and Piniella was asked if he will miss his
clubhouse leadership.</TE>
<TE>   "We need his bat for the next 10 or 12 days," Piniella said. "We
can get General Patton for the clubhouse."</TE>
<TE>   There is some doubt as to Patton's availability, but it may be too
late to rein in the A's anyway.</TE>
<TE>   These guys are the best stretch runners since Silky Sullivan.</TE>
<TE>   As Jayson Stark pointed out on ESPN.com, over the last two years
they are 73-15 after Aug. 1--which is an .830 percentage that
translates to an improbable record of 135-27 for a 162-game season.</TE>
<TE>   Their 20 consecutive victories are more wins than the New York
Mets, with a payroll 2 1/2 times that of the A's $40 million, have
totaled in the seven weeks of the second half and a longer streak
than the longest win streaks of the Yankees (seven games), Twins
(six) and Dodgers (five) combined this year.</TE>
<TE>   Why did it take so long for the A's to get on track?</TE>
<TE>   Well, put simplistically ...</TE>
<TE>   * Their young starting pitchers struggled during the first half;</TE>
<TE>   * Their Animal House antics may have contributed to a lack of
early focus, prompting Howe to turn down the clubhouse stereo and
management to make several roster changes;</TE>
<TE>   * And, there was an inevitable period of adjustment with Giambi,
Damon and closer Jason Isringhausen gone.</TE>
<TE>   "We had to feel our way for a while," said Howe, "but once they
figured they could do it without certain people, it all really came
together. The atmosphere during the streak has been like a playoff.
The energy and focus has been outstanding."</TE>
<TE>   And, of course, don't tell General Manager Billy Beane about
competitive and revenue disparities. He has again filled gaps with
David Justice, Billy Koch, Scott Hatteberg, John Mabry, Ray Durham
and Ricardo Rincon, among others. The volume may be lower in the
clubhouse, but the A's are still pretty loud and loose.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know what's going on in the clubhouse, but when I turn on
the TV I see a lot of weapons," Gwynn said.</TE>
<TE>   For Beane, the best thing about the streak is the fading calendar
accompanying it.</TE>
<TE>   Every game the A's win, he said, diminishes the importance of an
ensuing game, including those eight with the Angels.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, the A's can't keep giving up 22 runs, as they have in
the last three wins, and expect to sustain the streak. Nor can they
keep calling on closer Koch with daily regularity, especially when
they have an 11-0 lead.</TE>
<TE>   Still, Beane said, the streaking A's are clearly something special
and personify a 25-man unit.</TE>
<TE>   "We had a championship-caliber team last year," he said, "but the
media tended to focus on the one guy [Giambi], as if everybody else
was along for the ride.</TE>
<TE>   "This team is proving that wasn't the case. I mean, I saw a team
play as well as it could in the second half last year and thought I'd
seen it all.</TE>
<TE>   "Obviously, I was mistaken."</TE>

<HD>Waite Takes Fast Lane to Canadian Open Lead</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>No Tiger Woods. No traffic jams.</LD>
<LD>   For at least one day in the Canadian Open, Grant Waite finally had
no worries.</LD>
<LD>   After two years of bad luck and bad timing in golf's third-oldest
national championship, Waite made five birdie putts inside 15 feet on
the back nine of Angus Glen for an eight-under-par 64 to build a
two-stroke lead Thursday at Markham, Ontario.</LD>
<TE>   "It would be nice to win in Canada because I've played well at
times," said Waite, a 38-year-old from New Zealand who hasn't won in
nine years.</TE>
<TE>   Canada owes him one.</TE>
<TE>   Two years ago, his 21-under 267 would have been good enough to win
any of the 22 Canadian Opens held at Glen Abbey--except that Woods
was one stroke better, thanks to that outrageous six-iron out of a
fairway bunker and over the water for a birdie on the 18th.</TE>
<TE>   It got even worse last year at Royal Montreal.</TE>
<TE>   Waite missed his wake-up call and set his alarm for 6 p.m.--not 6
a.m. Then he got stuck in traffic and missed his tee time in the
opening round by six minutes, which was one minute too late to avoid
disqualification.</TE>
<TE>   "A comedy of errors," Waite called it.</TE>
<TE>   Thursday was anything but that. Waite missed only three greens,
took 27 putts and got into trouble only once for a 64 that allowed
him to surge past a pack of players at 66 that included '98 champion
Billy Andrade.</TE>
<TE>   Mike Weir had a 69, only it felt much lower. Canada's best player
has never come close to winning his national open. In fact, he missed
the cut his first nine tries.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Sweden's Robert Karlsson shot a six-under 65 to take a one-stroke
lead after the first round of the European Masters at
Crans-sur-Sierre, Switzerland. Craig Stadler, the tournament winner
in 1985, shot a 71, a stroke higher than 22-year-old son Kevin,
playing his second pro event after winning the Colorado Open last
weekend.</TE>
<TE>   Boxing</TE>
<TE>   Lennox Lewis will give up one of his heavyweight titles rather
than fight mandatory contender Chris Byrd, claiming that Byrd offers
him no great challenge and that no one wants to see the fight anyway.</TE>
<TE>   Lewis' decision to give up the International Boxing Federation
version of the title means the heavyweight championship will likely
be further fractured, though the public generally recognizes him as
the legitimate champion.</TE>
<TE>   It also opens the door for Evander Holyfield to fight Byrd to try
to become a heavyweight champion for the fifth time at age 40. Byrd
is the IBF's top-ranked contender, while Holyfield is No. 2.</TE>
<TE>   Pro Basketball</TE>
<TE>   The Orlando Magic, taking a gamble to shore up its thin front
line, signed troubled power forward Shawn Kemp to a free-agent
contract.</TE>
<TE>   Kemp is a six-time All-Star, but weight and drug problems have
sent his career into a tailspin. In the last two seasons with
Portland, he averaged 6.3 points and 3.8 rebounds. Terms of the deal
were not disclosed.</TE>
<TE>   Kemp entered a drug rehabilitation center for cocaine use in April
2001, near the end of his first season as a Trail Blazer. He returned
for the 2001-02 season but was suspended five games in February for
failing to comply with his aftercare program.</TE>
<TE>   Last month, Kemp reportedly agreed to forfeit more than $25
million of the $46.5 million left on his contract with the Trail
Blazers, and the team waived him.</TE>
<TE>   Free-agent guard Travis Best signed with the Miami Heat, his third
team since February. The 30-year-old Best becomes a possible
successor to starting point guard Rod Strickland, who is 36 and a
free agent.</TE>
<TE>   Hockey</TE>
<TE>   Montreal Canadien goalie Jose Theodore became the highest-paid
player in franchise history, signing a three-year, $16.5-million
contract.</TE>
<TE>   Theodore won the Hart Trophy as the NHL's most valuable player and
the Vezina as the top goalie last season when he led the Canadiens to
the playoffs for the first time in four years.</TE>
<TE>   Theodore, who will turn 26 next week, will earn $5 million this
season, $5.5 million in 2003-04, and $6 million in 2004-05. The deal
also contains numerous performance bonuses.</TE>
<TE>   Miscellany</TE>
<TE>   Sky Jack, winner of the Hollywood Gold Cup in July, will have a
third operation next week and will be out several months. The
6-year-old gray gelding will have a chip in his right knee removed,
trainer Doug O'Neill said Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   It's the latest setback for Sky Jack, who had two operations on
his right knee to remove bone chips a year ago. While recovering from
the second operations, the horse had two bouts with colic, which
nearly killed him.</TE>
<TE>   Tony Stewart picked track position over new tires with 35 laps to
go, taking the lead and holding off Kevin Harvick to win the Virginia
Is For Lovers 200 NASCAR Craftsman Truck Series race at Richmond, Va.</TE>
<TE>   Stewart, the Winston Cup star, was making only his second start in
the series.</TE>
<TE>   Dale Earnhardt Jr. made his venture into race car ownership a
smashing success, setting a track qualifying record of 126.868 mph

Earnhardt bettered Matt Kenseth's mark of 125.780 set in 2001.</TE>

<HD>49ers Put Best Foot Forward</HD>
<DH>Pro football: They beat Giants, 16-13, on Cortez's field
goal in thrilling finish to pedestrian season opener.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J.</DL>
<LD>What seemed like a dud of a season-opening party for the NFL actually
turned into a thriller.</LD>
<LD>   A seemingly invisible Terrell Owens made a 33-yard catch and run
to set up Jose Cortez's 36-yard field goal with six seconds to play,
giving the San Francisco 49ers a 16-13 victory over the New York
Giants in a Thursday night opener that ushered in the season.</LD>
<LD>   Cortez also had field goals of 23 and 33 yards and Garrison Hearst
scored on a nine-yard pass for the 49ers in a game that featured more
mistakes than good plays.</LD>
<TE>   "It took us the whole game to get going, but we won," San
Francisco Coach Steve Mariucci said. "Can you call this game ugly? I
guess you could say that."</TE>
<TE>   It became a great game to watch in the final minutes, capping an
opening that had started with a concert in the heart of New York
City, an event meant to honor those killed in the terrorist attacks
last Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   A blown coverage on Owens' catch led to the game-winning score,
which came right after Tiki Barber tied it with a one-yard TD run
with 1:49 to go.</TE>
<TE>   After returning the kickoff to the 30-yard line, the 49ers knew
what to do with the game on the line. They went to Owens, who until
that point had three catches for eight yards.</TE>
<TE>   "That's what I like, when the going gets tough and it's time for
me to make a play, then that's what I am going to do," Owens said.
"Big players make big plays."</TE>
<TE>   Owens ran by Jason Sehorn on the play and the cornerback let him
go, thinking he had help. He didn't get it.</TE>
<TE>   Owens caught the ball and wasn't tackled until he reached the New
York 37. A 12-yard pass to J.J. Stokes got the ball to the 25, and
Hearst's seven-yard run set up Cortez, who earlier had a 25-yarder
blocked and was short from 48.</TE>
<TE>   This one curled just inside the left upright.</TE>
<TE>   "After having a field goal blocked and missing another one, I was
just glad I came back and won the game," said Cortez, who played one
game with the Giants in 1999.</TE>
<TE>   Rookie Matt Bryant made field goals of 29 and 33 yards for the
Giants, who turned the ball over three times, had 80 yards in
penalties and one bad punt that led to the 49ers' touchdown.</TE>
<TE>   "Despite all the mistakes, we still should have won this game,"
said defensive end Michael Strahan, who was held without a sack.
"Hopefully, we will learn from this."</TE>
<TE>   The NFL ushered in this season with a special midweek start that
included a Manhattan concert. The league said it was celebrating New
York's resilience in the wake of the attacks that claimed the lives
of more than 3,000 people.</TE>

<LD>NEW YORK JETS AT BUFFALO</LD>
<LD>   Kickoff: Sunday, 10 a.m.</LD>
<LD>   The line: New York by 3</LD>
<TE>   Quick slant: Drew Bledsoe looks for new life, or life of any kind,
in Buffalo.</TE>
<TE>   Plot: After backing up Tom Brady's improbable rise to Super Bowl
hero, Bledsoe has re-emerged in Buffalo, throwing forward passes that
don't wobble and don't bounce twice before hitting the receivers'
hands and everything. Rookie offensive tackle Mike Williams is so
impressed, he told reporters this week that he is "ready to throw
myself on the sword for that man." Let's see: Bledsoe is 30 and
immobile and the Bills allowed 46 sacks last season. Keeping the
sword away from Bledsoe--that's the big task ahead for young Mike.</TE>

<TE>   BALTIMORE AT CAROLINA</TE>
<TE>   Kickoff: Sunday, 10 a.m.</TE>
<TE>   The line: Baltimore by 2</TE>
<TE>   Quick slant: Is there a quarterback in the house?</TE>
<TE>   Plot: Since winning the Super Bowl 19 months ago, Raven Coach
Brian Billick, erstwhile genius, has delivered an intriguing tutorial
on Quarterback De-evolution--spiraling downward, so to speak, from
Trent Dilfer to Elvis Grbac to Chris Redman. What does it all mean?
A: Jeff Blake, warming up in the bullpen. Meanwhile, in Carolina, new
Coach John Fox, still scratching his head over Chris Weinke, decides
to open the season with Rodney Peete, 36-year-old journeyman, at
quarterback. What does it all mean? A: Millions of pro football fans
suddenly realize Rodney Peete is still in the league.</TE>

<TE>   TV: Channel 11</TE>
<TE>   The line: Chicago by 4 1/2</TE>
<TE>   Quick slant: Minnesota, Chicago open on the road.</TE>
<TE>   Plot: There's no such thing as a free lunch in this league. The
Bears, following a bizarrely charmed 13-3 season, highlighted by
fluky finishes and game-winning Mike Brown interception returns, have
been introduced to the concept of cosmic payback: 16 road games in
2002. While season-long construction continues at Soldier Field, the
Bears will play all eight of their designated home games in
Champaign, Ill.--about 150 miles outside Chicago. Looking the place
over, Randy Moss tells the Vikings he'll decide if and when he wants
to play, will get back to them later.</TE>

<TE>   Kickoff: Sunday, 10 a.m.</TE>
<TE>   TV: Channel 2</TE>
<TE>   The line: Cincinnati by 2</TE>
<TE>   Quick slant: Where have you gone, Dan Fouts and Kenny Anderson?</TE>
<TE>   Plot: Before they played last September, the Chargers and Bengals
were a combined 4-0. Since then, a combined 7-21. So what happened?
Well, for starters, Jon Kitna began playing like Jon Kitna--he
finished the season with the league's lowest rating among starting
quarterbacks, 61.1--and Doug Flutie began feeling his age and his
height in a hurry. The fallout? Gus Frerotte becomes the Bengals'
fifth starting quarterback in five years while Flutie stands on his
tiptoes, trying to peak over the Chargers standing in front of him on
the sideline as he keeps a wary eye on Drew Brees.</TE>

<TE>   KANSAS CITY AT CLEVELAND</TE>
<TE>   Kickoff: Sunday, 10 a.m.</TE>
<TE>   The line: Cleveland by 3</TE>
<TE>   Quick slant: No NBA in Tony Gonzalez's future. No Super Bowl,
either.</TE>
<TE>   Plot: Noted talk show host and football pundit Regis Philbin,
playing "Who Wants to Suck Up to a Multimillionaire," told Kansas
City tight end Gonzalez on his show that the Chiefs are going to the
Super Bowl this season. In an upset, Gonzalez agreed. "The attitude
of the team is, we want to go to the Super Bowl," Gonzalez told
Philbin. "Coach [Dick] Vermeil has been there. He has the blueprint."
But until last week, Vermeil didn't have a tight end. But, finally,
Gonzalez ended his holdout and rejoined the Chiefs for a full
practice Wednesday, just in time to start their Super Bowl run 0-1.</TE>

<TE>   ATLANTA AT GREEN BAY</TE>
<TE>   Kickoff: Sunday, 10 a.m.</TE>
<TE>   The line: Green Bay by 7</TE>
<TE>   Quick slant: Falcons bump into Brett Favre again. Don't remind
them.</TE>
<TE>   Plot: Since making the 1992 trade that changed the course of NFL
history, the Falcons have rented the quarterback position to Chris
Miller, Wade Wilson, Bobby Hebert, Billy Joe Tolliver, Jeff George
and Chris Chandler--hoping now that Michael Vick, body parts willing,
can take out a long-term lease. At the same time, ex-Falcon Favre
prepares to start his 158th consecutive game for Green Bay, about two
months away from passing Johnny Unitas and Joe Montana in career
yardage. The only active pro athlete to start every game with the
same team since September 1992, Favre has become the new Cal Ripken
Jr.</TE>

<TE>   Kickoff: Sunday, 10 a.m.</TE>
<TE>   The line: Indianapolis by 3 1/2</TE>
<TE>   Quick slant: Tony Dungy brings Cover 2 scheme to Colts, replacing
old Cover Nobody scheme.</TE>
<TE>   Plot: Dungy knows defense; that was never a complaint in Tampa
Bay. Dungy couldn't win the big one--that's what got him fired after
another first-round playoff loss in January. For the record, Dungy
was 2-4 in postseason games with the Buccaneers. For Indianapolis,
that represented an upgrade over Jim Mora, who was winless in six
playoff games with the Colts and Saints, and got fired after deciding
the best way to overcome his inability to win in the postseason was
to avoid the postseason altogether.</TE>

<TE>   DETROIT AT MIAMI</TE>
<TE>   Kickoff: Sunday, 10 a.m.</TE>
<TE>   The line: Miami by 8</TE>
<TE>   Quick slant: Ricky Williams, savior? Or still the guy who got Mike
Ditka fired?</TE>
<TE>   Plot: Dave Wannstedt becomes the latest ex-Bear to stake his
coaching career on a big trade for Williams. Ditka sacrificed his
entire 1999 draft for the right to draft Williams, and with it, not
long afterward, his job with the New Orleans Saints. Now Wannstedt
has taken the bait and the Dolphins are talking Super Bowl,
conveniently ignoring these facts: a) Williams averaged 3.8 yards a
carry in three seasons with the Saints; b) Williams never took the
Saints any further than the second round of the playoffs; c) Jay
Fiedler continues to quarterback the Dolphins.</TE>

<TE>   PHILADELPHIA AT TENNESSEE</TE>
<TE>   Kickoff: Sunday, 10 a.m.</TE>
<TE>   The line: Tennessee by 1</TE>
<TE>   Quick slant: Philadelphia at Adelphia, where the Titans not too
long ago were unbeatable.</TE>
<TE>   Plot: The overloaded Eagle bandwagon creaks into Adelphia
Coliseum, where the 1999 AFC champions await. "This should be a heck
of a game," John Madden opines on ESPN.com. "It will be a real
hittin' game. Just the way the Eagles play defense and the Titans
play defense, I could see this as a real good defensive game. It has
hitting and turnovers written all over it." And that's why ABC is
paying Madden the big bucks.</TE>

<TE>   ARIZONA AT WASHINGTON</TE>
<TE>   Kickoff: Sunday, 10 a.m.</TE>
<TE>   The line: Washington by 7</TE>
<TE>   Quick slant: Another easy opener for Steve Spurrier, just like he
scheduled them at Florida.</TE>
<TE>   Plot: Western Michigan, Ball State, Marshall, the Arizona
Cardinals. They all look the same to Spurrier, the new Redskin coach,
who always liked his Gators easing into the season with a couple
cupcakes early on the schedule. Look for him to flip these Birds,
same as he has been doing to the rest of the league since the rest of
the league told Spurrier you can't win with Shane Matthews and Danny
Wuerffel. One way or the other, Spurrier or the league, one of them
is in for a lesson.</TE>

<TE>   The line: St. Louis by 3</TE>
<TE>   Quick slant: Missing in action for months, the Greatest Show On
Earth is rumored to make an appearance in Colorado.</TE>
<TE>   Plot: Having had seven months to mull how in the world he lost the
Super Bowl to New England, St. Louis Coach Mike Martz decided to
close practice this week. Behind locked doors, Martz is rumored to
have installed many unusual plays, including one that promises to
stun everyone who watched the Rams in the Super Bowl. Listen up: The
Rams are planning to hand the ball to Marshall Faulk. But keep it to
yourself.</TE>

<TE>   SEATTLE AT OAKLAND</TE>
<TE>   Kickoff: Sunday, 1:15 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   The line: Oakland by 7</TE>
<TE>   Quick slant: One more get-together, for old times' sake.</TE>
<TE>   Plot: Before realignment dragged the Seahawks into the NFC, this
was a fairly contentious AFC West rivalry, even after Rich Gannon
landed in Oakland and Mike Holmgren hitched his reputation in Seattle
to Matt Hasselbeck. With the Raiders graying and feuding, the
Chargers rebuilding and the Chiefs and Broncos wondering about their
quarterbacking, Holmgren might have liked his chances in the old
neighborhood this season. Instead, he now gets to hold four
post-defeat news conferences after games against St. Louis and San
Francisco and explain how he plans to hold off Arizona for third
place.</TE>

<TE>   NEW ORLEANS AT TAMPA BAY</TE>
<TE>   Kickoff: Sunday, 1:15 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   The line: Tampa Bay by 6</TE>
<TE>   Quick slant: For Buccaneers, it's the dawn of the Jon Gruden era.
Or the Jon Gruden error.</TE>
<TE>   Plot: Is any football coach worth two No. 1 and two No. 2 draft
picks? The Buccaneers have banked the next decade or so on the hope
of an affirmative answer, since those picks are long gone--Al Davis
goes to sleep each night counting them--and Gruden has arrived in
Tampa, determined to lead the league in underachieving quarterbacks
named Johnson. Who will it be--Brad or Rob, Rob or Brad? The
merry-go-round begins here, and the Buccaneers paid through the nose
for a ticket to ride.</TE>

<TE>   DALLAS AT HOUSTON</TE>
<TE>   Kickoff: Sunday, 5:30 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   TV: ESPN</TE>
<TE>   The line: Dallas by 8</TE>
<TE>   Quick slant: This state's not big enough for the two of them.</TE>
<TE>   Plot: Everyone's a little too excited about the new-kid Texans.
Madden watched rookie David Carr play one half in the Hall of Fame
game and was ready to start sculpting his bust for the museum. Sports
Illustrated touted the Texan-Cowboy opener on its cover with the
screaming headline, "War for Texas." The Texans have issued 400 media
credentials for the game and Carr, who really wouldn't know, has
likened the pregame frenzy in Houston to that of a Super Bowl.
Everyone, simmer down now. The Cowboys are favored in a season opener
for the first time since 1999, and as you will soon see, there are
many good reasons for that.</TE>

<TE>   Kickoff: Monday, 6 p.m.</TE>

<TE>   The line: Pittsburgh by 2 1/2</TE>
<TE>   Quick slant: Patriots won Super Bowl seven months ago. Nobody
quite believes it.</TE>
<TE>   Plot: Yes, they are the reigning Super Bowl champions. Yes, they
open the season at home, on Monday night, in brand-new, 68,000-seat
Gillette Stadium. Yes, they re-signed their promising young
quarterback and upgraded themselves at wide receiver and tight end.
Yes, the Patriots are 2 1/2-point underdogs to the team they defeated
on the road in last season's AFC championship game. Memories are
short in this league--didn't Kordell Stewart throw three
interceptions in that game, and isn't Stewart back in the Steeler
lineup, at least until the three-interception games start piling up
again?</TE>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>New England Patriot linebacker Ted Johnson has left the team for
undisclosed reasons.</LD>
<LD>   "Ted was not here yesterday, he's not with the team," New England
Coach Bill Belichick said Thursday. "I've talked to Ted a couple
times, and certainly would not want to say anything on his behalf or
try to characterize anything for him."</LD>
<LD>   When asked if Johnson would be back, Belichick replied, "I don't
know."</LD>
<TE>   Johnson, drafted in the second round in 1995, signed a five-year,
$25 million deal in 1998. Since then, his contract has been
restructured six times.</TE>
<TE>   Johnson had a career-high 142 tackles in 1998, but has been
plagued by injuries. He has torn the pectoral muscles in both arms,
was limited to 13 games and 11 starts in 2000 and started only five
games last season.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Cornerback Quentin Jammer will sit out the season rather than
accept the San Diego Chargers' contract offer, the player's agent
said.</TE>
<TE>   Jammer, the fifth pick overall in April's draft, is seeking a deal
that would pay $13.5 million during the first three seasons. The
Chargers are offering $12.6 million.</TE>
<TE>   Defensive tackle Ryan Sims, taken by Kansas City with the sixth
pick, signed last week for a reported $13 million for three years.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Cornerback Terrell Buckley, cut by Tampa Bay Sunday, signed with
New England.... Pro Bowl cornerback Troy Vincent could miss the
Philadelphia Eagles' opener Sunday after injuring his left knee in
practice.</TE>

<HD>Schilling, Arizona Outlast Giants, 8-5</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Curt Schilling yielded a 434-foot homer by Barry Bonds but pitched
seven innings of five-hit ball for his 22nd victory as the Arizona
Diamondbacks beat the San Francisco Giants, 8-5, Thursday night at
San Francisco.</LD>
<LD>   Schilling (22-5), the major league leader in wins, succeeded in
his third attempt to match his career-best win total of last season.
He yielded homers by Bonds and Tsuyoshi Shinjo, but he struck out
seven to boost his season total to 282, second in the majors behind
teammate Randy Johnson.</LD>
<LD>   Tony Womack added a three-run triple in the eighth for the
Diamondbacks, who boosted their National League West lead to 5 1/2
games over the idle Dodgers and 8 1/2 games over the Giants.</LD>
<TE>   The Giants, who lost for the third time in four games, beat
Schilling, 5-0, in Phoenix last week, but they never recovered from
Arizona's four-run first inning in the first game of a key four-game
series.</TE>
<TE>   The Diamondbacks' first eight hitters either reached base or drove
in a run against Jason Schmidt (10-7), whose three-game winning
streak ended. was snapped. Junior Spivey and Damian Miller both had
run-scoring doubles as Arizona spotted Schilling a four-run lead
before he had thrown a pitch.</TE>
<TE>   Bonds hit his 608th career homer--a two-run blast that was his
41st of the season--into deep right-center in the fourth. Shinjo
added a solo shot in the fifth, but Schilling otherwise kept the
Giants in check, beating them for the third time this season.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Philadelphia 4, Montreal 1--Bobby Abreu homered twice and tripled
as the Phillies avoided a four-game sweep with a win at Montreal in
front of the smallest crowd in Olympic Stadium history.</TE>
<TE>   Players' voices could be heard over the sparse and quiet crowd,
announced as 2,134--which represents tickets sold. The actual
attendance appeared to be closer to 1,000.</TE>
<TE>   Randy Wolf (11-7) gave up five hits in pitching his third complete
game of the season. His scoreless innings streak ended at 27 innings
when he gave up Vladimir Guerrero's solo homer with two outs in the
first.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   New York 4, Florida 1--Steve Trachsel gave up a run in seven sharp
innings as the Mets won at New York. Jeromy Burnitz and Ty Wigginton
hit back-to-back homers for the Mets, who have won three in a row
after setting an NL record by losing 15 consecutive home games.</TE>
<TE>   Playing their final home game before Sept. 11, the Mets held a
pregame "Night of Remembrance" to honor the rescue and recovery
workers who labored at the World Trade Center site after the
terrorist attacks.</TE>
<TE>   New York Gov. George Pataki addressed the crowd during the
20-minute ceremony. Between innings, the Mets showed brief interviews
with the honorees and Manager Bobby Valentine and John Franco, and
clips of the cleanup effort.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Houston 5, San Diego 0--Jeff Bagwell broke a scoreless tie with an
RBI single in the 11th and Brian Hunter capped Houston's five-run
inning with a bases-loaded triple as the Astros won at San Diego.
Houston moved to within four games of first-place St. Louis in the NL
Central.</TE>
<TE>   The Astros had the go-ahead run thrown out at home in the ninth
inning when Craig Biggio tried to score from second base on Bagwell's
single. But Cesar Crespo's throw from left field got Biggio, who was
blocked at home by catcher Wiki Gonzalez.</TE>

<HD>Slater Looks for Joyous Return to Tour</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>PETE THOMAS</AU>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Hurricane Hernan came through spectacularly, delivering large rolling
swells that peeled beautifully over a point break as legendary as
some of the surfers who have paddled out over the years at Lower
Trestles in San Clemente.</LD>
<LD>   Some of those legends were on hand Thursday, as part of the
traveling band of superstars known as the Assn. of Surfing
Professionals World Championship Tour. But none was as notable as
Kelly Slater, the sport's most successful athlete, with an
unprecedented six world titles.</LD>
<LD>   Slater helped kick off the Boost Mobile Pro, the sixth of 12 tour
events this year and the only one being held on the U.S. mainland, by
drawing the first of 16 opening-round heats.</LD>
<TE>   And while he showed immediately that he still has the brilliant
moves that made him such a dominating champion, afterward he revealed
a side not seen during his early years on the tour.</TE>
<TE>   The result didn't seem as important to him.</TE>
<TE>   Slater took a commanding lead in his heat against Paul Canning of
South Africa and Luke Egan of Australia, scoring 7.75 out of a
possible 10 with his stylish, sweeping turns on the face of a long
right-breaking wave; then posting an 8.5 with a series of backside
off-the-lips that drew applause from the 200 spectators lined on the
pebbly beach.</TE>
<TE>   But Egan edged Slater in the final minute, catching a large
right-breaking wave and snapping off a series of off-the-lips and
cutbacks that impressed both the crowd and the judges. They gave him
a 9.25 and that, added to his next highest wave, a 7.25, gave him the
heat.</TE>
<TE>   The triumph propelled Egan to the third round, while Slater and
Canning must compete in today's second-round elimination heats.</TE>
<TE>   "When he took off I just started laughing because I knew it was a
good wave," said Slater, who is from Cocoa Beach, Fla. "But that's
the way it goes sometimes."</TE>
<TE>   That's the way it has gone all season for Slater, 30, who is back
on tour after a three-year hiatus, and whose best finish through five
events is ninth.</TE>
<TE>   When he burst onto the scene 10 years ago, he became the youngest
to win a world championship at 20. He finished third the following
year, in 1993, then ran off a remarkable string of five consecutive
championships.</TE>
<TE>   But that was a different Slater, the one with a steely glare and
the drive and determination of a great athlete at the top of his
game. His peers know it. "Once you lose that burning desire it's hard
to get it back," says Pat O'Connell, 30, a 10-year tour veteran from
Laguna Beach and the winner of his heat Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   And even Slater acknowledges it. "It doesn't matter as much as it
did when I was trying to get all the accolades, back when I was a
kid," he says. "Before, contests meant everything to me. Now that has
changed."</TE>
<TE>   Now Slater has nothing left to prove, and it shows. Now he's
trying to enjoy life on the tour rather than burn out on it--again.
Now he's keeping his sponsors happy by maintaining a prominent place
under the international spotlight.</TE>
<TE>   Now he has an Activision game due in the stores any day, which
will further immortalize the surfer and put a few more million
dollars in his pocket. Keeping a high profile can only help sales.</TE>
<TE>   That's just one of the things distracting Slater, who acknowledges
as much while hinting that he is planning on making a charge during
the second half of a tour that culminates at the famed Banzai
Pipeline on Oahu in December.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm still struggling to get back to where I was mentally," he
says.</TE>
<TE>   In any event, the tour is happy to have Slater back.</TE>
<TE>   "It's fantastic," Egan says. "Every guy in the top 44 [on the WCT]
has lifted their levels of surfing because of Kelly's presence"</TE>
<TE>   Slater can chalk that up as a victory.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   A dropping swell will greet surfers for today's two-man
elimination heats--Slater will go up against Lee Winkler of
Australia--but another big swell, generated by a storm in the South
Pacific, is forecast to arrive before competition resumes Sunday
morning. The finals are Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Fun While It Lasted?</TE>
<TE>   For many, the summer fishing season is over. The rods and reels
are back in the closet and the focus is on school and work. "They've
had their money allocated, spent it on fishing and used all their
sick days, so it's over," said Don Ashley, owner of Pierpoint Landing
in Long Beach. "It's dead."</TE>
<TE>   Ashley is more fatalistic than most when referring to the annual
post-Labor Day phenomenon, which brings sportfishing to a near halt
along much of the waterfront.</TE>
<TE>   But it's a point well made. Some of the landings have already
canceled some of their half-and three-quarter-day trips. And the
offshore overnight boats are carrying an average of only 12 to 15
anglers, about a third of what they carried during the busy weeks of
summer.</TE>
<TE>   And therein lies the attraction for those who prefer this time to
any other. The albacore grounds are still teeming with fish, from San
Quintin, well below Ensenada, up to and beyond Morro Bay off Central
California. And many believe the yellowfin tuna will move to within
range of at least the San Diego fleet before the season is over.</TE>
<TE>   "Fall is the best time because we usually have the flat calm
weather and the fish typically move closer to shore," said Gary
White, a spokesman for Fisherman's Landing in San Diego. "The fact
that we're getting out with smaller loads is bad for business but
great for the anglers."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Go Figure</TE>
<TE>   Such an abundance of albacore and, to a lesser extent, bluefin
tuna, is somewhat unusual for this time of year. Typically, the
albacore are long gone by now and the yellowfin are the catch of the
day for those aboard San Diego overnight boats.</TE>
<TE>   But this season has been anything but typical. Offshore surface
temperatures, although having warmed considerably during the last few
days, have yet to take hold for any length of time, leading some to
wonder what has become of the El Nino everyone had been talking about
a few months ago.</TE>
<TE>   Ashley said his captains earlier this week, fishing east of San
Clemente Island, have had to search for water warm enough to hold
albacore, rather than cold enough. They found readings as low as 60
degrees at a time when 70-degree readings are more common, even
during non-El Nino years.</TE>
<TE>   Unseasonably cool water is being found deep into Baja California.
Gene Allshouse of San Quintin Sportfishing reported this week, "I
don't ever remember catching albacore in September. But we are."</TE>
<TE>   Allshouse, however, said that the water 12 miles offshore was 69
degrees, too warm for albacore, and that he anticipated a changing of
the guard within a week or so.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Dove Opener: Hot</TE>
<TE>   How hot was Sunday's dove-hunting season opener? In southeastern
California and southwestern Arizona, the hotbeds of dove hunting,
temperatures soared as high as 115 degrees.</TE>
<TE>   Fortunately, most hunters bagged their 10-bird limits in the cool
of the morning, if there is such a thing down there at this time of
year.</TE>
<TE>   "By our nonscientific calculations, 98% of the hunters got their
limits and had good hunting for the opening two days," said Richard
Sprague, owner of Sprague's Sports &amp; RV in Yuma, Ariz. "The second
day was slower, as is usual, but on the field that I shot, that meant
an extra 15 minutes or so to get our limits."</TE>
<TE>   Hunting was as good or better across the border in the Blythe and
Imperial Valley areas, and fair to good throughout most of
California. Ed Sandell of Somis, Calif., participating in a DFG
special hunt in the Bakersfield area, reported limits by 7:20 a.m.
for his son, Todd, and himself. "But most of the hunters were
scratching out half-limits by mid-morning," he said. "Finding the
feed and getting away from other hunters seemed to be the key."</TE>
<TE>   The early season--another is scheduled this fall--runs through
Sept. 15.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Winding Up</TE>
<TE>   The "New American Sportsman" will debut Monday at 5 p.m. on ESPN2.
The weekly show is a "reimagined" version of the highly popular
"American Sportsman" of the 1960s and '70s.</TE>
<TE>   The host is actor and outdoorsman Rick Schroder, who said in a
news release, "It's a fun way for people to get to know me."</TE>
<TE>   The real fun is reserved for the celebrities. Segments of the
first episode include tarpon fishing off Key West with golfer Jack
Nicklaus; tracking and darting a 5,000-pound rhino in South Africa
with actor Greg Kinnear, and snorkeling with sharks off Key Largo
with former "Baywatch" actress Simmone Jade Mackinnon.</TE>

<KH>PACIFIC 10 CHRIS DUFRESNE</KH>
<HD>Tedford Gets Points Across to Bears</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRIS DUFRESNE</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It's all they're talking about in the Bay Area, the streak, the
streak, the streak, so we dispatched an Internet search engine task
force team to investigate.</LD>
<LD>   The results were startling.</LD>
<LD>   The California Golden Bears have not lost a college football game
since last Nov. 17, a defeat-less skein that, by months, trumps
anything the Oakland Athletics have accomplished.</LD>
<TE>   Mind you, Cal started last year 0-10 before a season-ending
victory at Rutgers. Cal celebrated by firing nice-guy-finished-last
coach Tom Holmoe, replaced him with Oregon offensive coordinator Jeff
Tedford, who promptly extended the Bears' victory streak to two games
after last weekend's season-opening 70-22 thrashing of Baylor.</TE>
<TE>   The question now: When will it end?</TE>
<TE>   California has not played in the Rose Bowl game since 1959, hasn't
posted a winning season since 1993 and hasn't played anything
remotely resembling football in years, yet the dance troupe once
known as Buzz-by Berkeley is a double-digit favorite to win its third
consecutive game when it plays host to New Mexico State on Saturday?</TE>
<TE>   California hasn't won three consecutive games since 1998, roughly
the last time one of its quarterbacks tossed a straight pass.</TE>
<TE>   You want pathetic? Cal finished the 2001 conference season ranked
last in scoring offense and defense and first in penalties.</TE>
<TE>   If that wasn't enough, the on-field woes were packaged with an
academic fraud scandal that landed the football team on probation.</TE>
<TE>   The big joke on campus had to be the one-year bowl ban imposed for
this season, as if Cal had a hippies' chance of winning the six games
required.</TE>
<TE>   Cal appealed the bowl ban, mainly to keep lame-duck seniors from
clicking the Express Program Checkout option on their computer screen
menu.</TE>
<TE>   Now, who knows? Are six wins out of the question?</TE>
<TE>   OK, time out for this public service announcement: Until it proves
otherwise, California remains the Pacific 10's basement property.</TE>
<TE>   The streak?</TE>
<TE>   It started last year at Rutgers, a worse major college program you
will not find, and was extended last week with a victory over the
Baylor (bad news) Bears.</TE>
<TE>   Yet, for the first time in a while, Cal players don't look as if
they need directions to their positions, and the point differential
in the Baylor win was stunning.</TE>
<TE>   Under Tedford, the 40-year-old former Oregon assistant who called
plays last year for Joey Harrington, Cal appears to have undergone a
major adjustment.</TE>
<TE>   You might have expected 50-yard line cartwheels after last week's
70-point outburst, which represented 34.8% of the total points Cal
scored last season.</TE>
<TE>   Yet, the postgame demeanor was professionally subdued.</TE>
<TE>   "We didn't respond any differently than a team like Oregon does,"
Tedford said of the Pac-10's best program since 1995.</TE>
<TE>   Tedford, a product of Downey's Warren High, already has been
compared to a young Jon Gruden, a disciple of offense and sleep
deprivation.</TE>
<TE>   His goal this year is to make senior quarterback Kyle Boller the
outstanding player he was projected to be coming out of Newhall's
Hart High. Tedford pored over old game tapes and quickly concluded he
inherited a guy who had grossly underachieved.</TE>
<TE>   Tedford reworked Boller's throwing motion and mental
approach--going so far as to create a board game in which Boller and
the coach go over strategies by moving offense and defense checker
pieces.</TE>
<TE>   Why should Boller be all ear holes?</TE>
<TE>   In tutorial stints at Fresno State and Oregon, Tedford coached
Trent Dilfer, recruited David Carr, and put finishing touches on
Akili Smith and Harrington. All became first-round NFL draft picks.</TE>
<TE>   In his first game paired with Tedford's play calling, Boller
completed a career-high 62.2% of his passes against Baylor, with
three touchdowns.</TE>
<TE>   Tedford's breakdown?</TE>
<TE>   "He missed some passes he should have made," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Wow, maybe this is a whole new ball game at Cal.</TE>
<TE>   Pac Bits</TE>
<TE>   It was quite a week for Washington Coach Rick Neuheisel, who
signed a six-year contract extension in the aftermath of his
questionable decision-making in the heartbreaking loss to Michigan.
In fact, the Neuheisel extension had been worked out over the summer.
The school planned to announce the news at a news conference this
week but held off after disturbing developments in Ann Arbor.</TE>
<TE>   "There may have been rioting in the streets," Neuheisel joked to
the Seattle Times.</TE>
<TE>   When news of the extension was reported in the papers, Washington
issued a release to confirm the details.</TE>
<TE>   Neuheisel is still taking heat over losing a last-second decision
to Michigan on a field goal set up after Washington was flagged for
having 12 men on the field.</TE>
<TE>   "On one hand, we're absolutely mortified with the way things
turned out," Neuheisel said, "but on the other hand there are 11
games to play."</TE>
<TE>   That's right, 11, same as the number of men you're supposed to
play on defense.</TE>
<TE>   "We have a mechanism in place for how we substitute, it just broke
down so we're fixing it," Neuheisel said.</TE>
<TE>   Buddy Teevens makes his coaching debut at Stanford this weekend
when the Cardinal opens at Boston College. "It's exciting, but you
try to separate the personal from the professional," Teevens said.</TE>
<TE>   The coach's debut didn't get easier when starting quarterback
Chris Lewis was suspended last week for the opener for breaking a
minor and undisclosed NCAA rule. Kyle Matter, a redshirt freshman
from Hart High, the same school that produced Boller, makes his first
collegiate start.</TE>
<TE>   Stanford, citing academic concerns, is the lone Pac-10 school
playing only 11 games this year, which could become a factor in the
Rose Bowl title tiebreaker scenario if the Cardinal has only two
nonconference victories.</TE>

<DH>College football: After spending time in jail, UCLA
quarterback Paus will try to take it one game at a time without
drinking.</DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As UCLA begins the first week of a new season, Cory Paus begins his
11th week of sobriety.</LD>
<LD>   The senior quarterback is abstaining from alcohol, confronting a
problem that resulted in two convictions for driving under the
influence the last three years, and two stints in jail in the last
year.</LD>
<LD>   "I realize I can't go out and drink, not even like an average
22-year-old," he said. "It's strange that I actually know how long
I've been sober. The biggest reason I'm doing this is to guarantee
that drinking won't have a negative effect on my ability to perform.</LD>
<TE>   "Even a couple beers with friends, that's not going to help me win
a game."</TE>
<TE>   Quarterbacks typically meet for hours a day, to review plays, to
study film, to decide when to meet next.</TE>
<TE>   As a member of Alcoholics Anonymous, Paus sits through meetings
that focus on 12 steps, not 11 players. He is approaching the season
with a clear head.</TE>
<TE>   A clean slate will be more difficult.</TE>
<TE>   UCLA fans can't forget his most recent game, a humiliating 27-0
loss to USC last November in which he passed for a career-low 45
yards. It was the final and most disturbing of four consecutive
losses after the Bruins opened 6-0.</TE>
<TE>   Then came the sound bites of Paus under siege in the interview
room at the Coliseum. He was peppered with questions not only about
his dismal performance but also about the DUI convictions, which had
come to light two days earlier in media reports.</TE>
<TE>   Why had he failed to inform Coach Bob Toledo of the incidents? Did
he really believe he could keep them secret, especially when he had
been sentenced to jail time? How did he feel about letting down
teammates already reeling from the suspension of tailback DeShaun
Foster for committing an NCAA extra-benefits violation?</TE>
<TE>   Paus, accustomed to standing tall under pressure, didn't flinch,
answering every question and even shooing away a UCLA official who
tried to pull him from the podium.</TE>
<TE>   It was as if he believed that enduring a public flogging was part
of his penance.</TE>
<TE>   There was more to come. He spent four days in L.A. County jail in
January, then did another 10-day jail term in Bridgeport, Calif.,
during spring break for violating his probation on the first DUI
conviction--a wet reckless outside Mammoth Lakes two years ago.</TE>
<TE>   "All I could do was sit there in a steel cell and think about my
life," he said. "I know I am not a criminal, but I committed crimes
that forced me to be there. It was a humbling experience.</TE>
<TE>   "I saw things that go on, and the type of people who were in
there, and understood how lucky I am to be in college and have
special skills. It was a time for reflection."</TE>
<TE>   He satisfied court-ordered community service hours by speaking at
Boys and Girls Clubs and at a camp for children with muscular
dystrophy. He started attending AA meetings, another condition of his
probation.</TE>
<TE>   Yet he continued to drink. Not every night. Not getting
falling-down drunk. But still a few beers at home, a few beers at a
bar, a few nights a week.</TE>
<TE>   It's what everybody does, he believed. He'd been drinking since he
was 16, growing up outside Chicago. He and his friends drank to keep
warm on frigid winter nights, to cool off on sweltering summer
afternoons.</TE>
<TE>   When he first came to UCLA, there were nights of beery initiation
with the resident star, quarterback Cade McNown. Beer was
lubrication, and Paus bonded with teammates and lost that funny
Midwest accent when his words were slurred.</TE>
<TE>   He was required to attend AA meetings after his first conviction,
but Paus wasn't open to the message. None of it applied to him, he
told himself, not to the 19-year-old UCLA quarterback of the future
who just partied like everyone else.</TE>
<TE>   But last spring he found himself back at the meetings, again under
a judge's orders. This time sitting in a circle with people gripping
cups of black coffee gave Paus pause: Where had that future gone?</TE>
<TE>   His career began with promise, seven starts as a redshirt freshman
in 1999 before the season ended prematurely because of a broken
collarbone against Washington. The next season he passed for 2,154
yards and 17 touchdowns, solid numbers considering he missed three
games because of a separated shoulder and was knocked out of the Sun
Bowl with another collarbone break.</TE>
<TE>   Last season the problem was his right thumb, sprained in a summer
workout when he foolishly stepped in at wide receiver "to show some
guys some things." The injury nagged him all season and his
production dipped to 1,740 yards and eight touchdowns.</TE>
<TE>   He watched from the sideline as senior reserve Scott McEwan threw
three touchdown passes in a season-ending victory over Arizona State.</TE>
<TE>   A few months later he was stuck in idle again, sitting in an AA
meeting listening to others relate their tales of woe. This time he
opened his ears, and his heart.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not hiding, not faking it," he said. "The first time I didn't
get anything out of it. This time it is much more beneficial."</TE>
<TE>   Paus vows not to drink during the season, raising the question:
What about the rest of his life?</TE>
<TE>   "There is no plan," he said. "I have a feeling that alcohol will
not be a significant part of my life ever again."</TE>
<TE>   Robert Mauer, outreach coordinator of the Addiction Recovery
Resource Center, said it would be unrealistic for Paus to proclaim
that he would never drink again.</TE>
<TE>   "People in recovery take it a day at a time," Mauer said. "The
response I would have liked to have heard is, 'I don't plan on using
today.' But the football season is foremost on his mind and he was in
a bind. So I think that saying he won't drink all season is
appropriate."</TE>
<TE>   The day after UCLA's last game will be a crossroads for Paus.</TE>
<TE>   "He's already projected that as his end point, his goal, so that
might be a difficult time," Mauer said. "Anybody in recovery will
tell you there are no safe places. This is something he will have to
wrestle with for the rest of his life.</TE>
<TE>   "But even if he did drink after the season, it's not condoned, but
not condemned, either. I wouldn't say it was terrible that he had a
drink at the end of the season, but rather what he does at that
point, continue drinking or get back on the program and deal with why
he drank again."</TE>
<TE>   For now, teammates have noticed the change. In the huddle, where
Paus is more authoritative, and at parties, where he walks around
with a glass of water.</TE>
<TE>   "He has a more serious approach to the season, all business,"
senior tight end Mike Seidman said. "And off the field, he's making
an impact because everybody watches the quarterback. When you see him
out and he's not drinking and you are, it makes you feel guilty in a
weird way."</TE>
<TE>   Seidman learned his own lesson a few days before fall camp began,
getting pulled over outside a club and undergoing a field sobriety
test with a policeman's flashlight in his face.</TE>
<TE>   "I wasn't drunk, thank God," Seidman said. "But I thought, 'What
if?' I thought, 'This is what happened to Cory.' "</TE>
<TE>   Freshman quarterbacks Drew Olson and Matt Moore trod carefully
upon arriving at UCLA, having read about Paus' problems. Their
parents worried that the senior might be a poor influence.</TE>
<TE>   "Cory is nothing like what I thought he might be," Moore said.
"He's a great example, on and off the field. He's the leader of the
football team."</TE>
<TE>   Paus owes a debt of gratitude to Toledo, who has forgiven but not
forgotten. Perhaps the coach had no alternative--no other quarterback
is ready to step in--but he was willing to patch a relationship torn
apart by Paus' deceit.</TE>
<TE>   "He knows he made a big mistake and I know he made a big mistake,"
Toledo said. "We've put it behind us. Our rapport is good. We have an
understanding. He can't afford to make any more mistakes."</TE>
<TE>   The fence mending continued. Dan Guerrero received a call from
Paus shortly after becoming UCLA athletic director in July.</TE>
<TE>   "We talked about the incident," Guerrero said. "He is remorseful
and ready to accept a leadership role. He did this all on his own. He
has an opportunity to turn a negative into a positive."</TE>
<TE>   Paus visited his parents in Illinois and went out with friends,
the ones he used to drink with in high school. Most did not attend
college, found jobs and go to bars on weekends.</TE>
<TE>   "My parents said that this was the big test, going out with my old
friends," he said. "And you know what? They said, 'Good for you, it's
about time.' It felt really good not to drink and have them be
supportive. It was pretty exciting."</TE>
<TE>   There are more hurdles ahead. Paus must stay free of injury,
always an issue with him. He must adjust to new personnel, especially
at center and running back. He must prove he can consistently
complete short passes, oddly the ones that have given him the most
trouble.</TE>
<TE>   A strong season would boost his place in the UCLA record book. He
is fifth in passing yardage with 5,230, fewer than 1,000 yards from
catapulting to second behind McNown, who had 10,708. He could also
finish second in touchdowns and completions.</TE>
<TE>   "It makes me upset [that] I've missed so many games with
injuries," he said. "I've had a roller coaster career, yet I'm still
up there with some pretty good names. I don't think about it much,
but it's obvious to me that if I'd never been hurt, I'd be close to
beating all the records."</TE>
<TE>   His thumb remains a concern, hurting when he takes a snap
awkwardly or hits it against the ground.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know if it will ever be like it was," he said. "It's as
good as it's going to be."</TE>
<TE>   Like so many aspects of his life, the condition of his thumb is
largely beyond his control. Abstaining from alcohol, however, is a
choice he is making each day.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm focusing on what kind of person I am," he said. "Everybody is
looking at me in the huddle. How am I going to react?</TE>
<TE>   "And after the game, if I'm out there and not drinking, maybe the
younger guys will refrain from it. Maybe by watching me and
understanding what I went through, they'll see that's the way to go."</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>For 20 years, football players from Encino Crespi High lined the
hallways and crowded the examination rooms of Dr. Richard Ferkel's
Van Nuys medical office on a Saturday in August for what had become a
rite of summer: an assembly line-style medical screening that allowed
them to participate in sports.</LD>
<LD>   Usually lasting no more than a few minutes per player and
performed for a nominal fee, the screenings were popular for
convenience--and because they almost always ended with the doctor
signing medical clearance forms required annually from each athlete
by the California Interscholastic Federation.</LD>
<LD>   But this summer, Ferkel, an orthopedic surgeon, joined a growing
number of physicians who are avoiding medical screenings or are
limiting their participation in them. Because of health and liability
concerns heightened by a spate of deaths and catastrophic injuries in
recent years, he no longer welcomes the responsibility of checking
body systems outside his specialty.</LD>
<TE>   "Many years ago, I think [specialists] were more comfortable with
doing everything," Ferkel said. "But that has changed."</TE>
<TE>   Last year, 17 high school and junior high football players died,
according to the National Center for Catastrophic Sport Injury
Research at the University of North Carolina. That equaled the
highest number since 1976, when there were 22 deaths.</TE>
<TE>   Six of last year's football deaths were attributed to heart
problems, including that of Jonathan Diaz, a 17-year-old lineman from
Wilmington Banning High who went into cardiac arrest during a
practice. He had failed a preseason health examination and had been
cleared to play not long before he was stricken..</TE>
<TE>   Cross-country runner Jason Kortekaas, 17, of Victorville Silverado
and soccer player Ryan King, 16, of Manhattan Beach Mira Costa also
died last year of heart ailments.</TE>
<TE>   Heart conditions, which can be difficult to detect, are of
particular concern to the many orthopedists and chiropractors who are
team doctors and have been annually called on to perform screenings.</TE>
<TE>   "[The screenings] help find things that are in a moderate or
severe state [of damage]," said Dr. Mel Hayashi, an orthopedic
specialist and longtime football team doctor for Newbury Park High,
Moorpark College and Cal Lutheran University. " ... [But] with heart
problems it's hard. Things like arrhythmia problems are subtle. We
can't pick those up on our exams."</TE>
<TE>   Though short in duration, a typical screening includes a wide
range of checks: The heart and lungs are monitored with a
stethoscope; there is a short discussion about the athlete's medical
history; height, weight, blood pressure and pulse rates are measured,
and brief orthopedic checks of the strength and flexibility of the
limbs and spine are made. Some examinations also include vision tests
and checks of the ears, nose, throat and abdominal cavity, leaving
some specialists worried that they're straying too far from their
areas of expertise.</TE>
<TE>   "The danger is missing something," said Jerry Bornstein, a retired
orthopedist who assigns game-day medical personnel for about 25
schools in the San Fernando Valley. "You miss one kid and that's the
kid you read about."</TE>
<TE>   As a result, even doctors who enjoy working the sidelines as team
physicians on game nights are among those who won't participate in
medical screenings. Echoing Ferkel's concerns, Dr. Mark Getelman, an
orthopedist who has worked with the Thousand Oaks football team for
10 years, said he was "happy to clear athletes from an orthopedic
point of view," but "wasn't comfortable doing it with the heart,
lungs and a lot of the other things that are required."</TE>
<TE>   There are two major considerations: The quality of care--cited
most often by specialists as the reason they are hesitant to take
part in screenings; and liability--the factor most often mentioned by
coaches and athletic directors as the reason specialists are
increasingly wary.</TE>
<TE>   Liability is an issue because malpractice insurers may exclude a
procedure from coverage or limit coverage, based on a wide variety of
factors. Ferkel said liability concerns were a "minor consideration"
in his decision not to provide screenings this year.</TE>
<TE>   But several school officials said they're convinced liability
worries sideline many physicians who would otherwise be willing to
help.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not the risk of injuries," said Jon Mack, football coach at
Ventura St. Bonaventure. "It's the risk of lawsuits."</TE>
<TE>   Move That Line</TE>
<TE>   At Corona del Mar High's annual all-sports screening session in
June, two orthopedic specialists provided on-the-spot medical
clearance for all but four of the 126 athletes they saw in
examinations that usually lasted less than five minutes.</TE>
<TE>   A case of asthma, a skeletal disorder, a shoulder injury and an
injured knee were referred for further evaluation.</TE>
<TE>   "This is by no means, nor is it intended to be, a full, complete
physical," cautioned Dr. Michael Gordon, one of the participating
physicians. "These screenings are for obvious things."</TE>
<TE>   Meggan Stockstill, whose son, Beau, plays water polo and baseball
for Corona del Mar, said she considers the process "a rubber stamp,"
adding, "I don't depend on it."</TE>
<TE>   However, in the absence of regular health care, some athletes do
depend on screenings.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't have a regular doctor, so I just come here," said Tejay
Lord, a running back on the Dorsey High football team who attended a
free screening this month at Orthopedic Hospital of Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   For others, time is an issue. "During the week, I work Monday
through Friday," said Kimberly King, whose son, Michael Carr, plays
linebacker for Dorsey. "By the time I get off work, these guys would
be closed. It's not always easy to get time off, and some people
can't afford to take it."</TE>
<TE>   Aware that the screenings are the only health care some athletes
might receive in a year, doctors attempt to ensure that athletes and
parents know what they're getting--and not getting--during the exams.</TE>
<TE>   Time constraints--keeping that long line moving--only add to their
difficulty. "When you look at the volume of kids ... there's an
apathy that comes into play, and you almost get dulled by it," said
Dr. John Dingilian, a family practitioner who is the football team
physician for Granada Hills High.</TE>
<TE>   Said Dr. Gregg Hartman, an orthopedic specialist who helped screen
220 athletes from Royal and Simi Valley highs: "I'm going through too
many kids too fast. We're looking for red flags, really."</TE>
<TE>   The fear of a rushed examination was the reason several parents
cited as to why they take their young athletes to the family
physician each year.</TE>
<TE>   Joanne Mooreland sent her son, Westlake High tight end Will Faul,
to a screening when he was a freshman. Now a senior, he hasn't been
back.</TE>
<TE>   "It just seemed like he was part of the pack," she said. "I just
felt like we got rushed through. This way, I don't worry when he's
out there [playing], because I know he's been checked out. I like the
attention better, and if there is, in fact, anything wrong with him,
I'd rather have it on record with our doctor."</TE>
<TE>   Suggesting a Cure</TE>
<TE>   As long as the CIF demands all athletes receive annual medical
clearance--a mandate that isn't likely to change--screenings will
probably remain part of the high school sports landscape. So the
question becomes how to make them more effective.</TE>
<TE>   The dozen or so doctors interviewed for this story are largely in
agreement on some safeguards they say would improve the process:</TE>
<TE>   * Standardize the authorization form. The CIF recommends schools
use a release form that was developed five years ago in a cooperative
effort among five nationally recognized health and sports medicine
organizations. The form includes a checklist of 16 personal
medical-history questions that doctors say can be keys in identifying
potential health problems, and it is already required by some
districts, including Los Angeles Unified. This fall, the CIF is
expected to take the first step toward requiring that all schools use
the same form, a move welcomed by many medical practitioners.</TE>
<TE>   * Be more selective. Chiropractors have long volunteered their
services in the absence of other medical professionals, but this year
the Oxnard School District said it wouldn't accept a physical
performed by anyone other than a medical doctor. LAUSD requires that
examinations be performed either by a physician or a physician's
assistant with the doctor co-signing--and it asks school nurses to
become familiar with local doctors' signatures and double-check
clearance forms they suspect might be falsified. Stamps with the
physician's license number, location, phone numbers and other
pertinent information must be on the form along with the signature.</TE>
<TE>   * Organize teams of specialists. A orthopedist stretches beyond
his level of expertise if he is the only physician at a screening.
But combine an orthopedist working with a pediatrician, an internist
and a cardiologist, and you have an improved system. "It's best for
everybody to let the experts handle their areas," Getelman said.</TE>
<TE>   Several hospitals and clinics already offer low-cost or free
medical screenings for athletes from schools in their areas, so the
trick would be to find more general practitioners and a broader range
of specialists who are willing to work them as a team.</TE>
<TE>   Until that happens, individual specialists who work screenings
walk a tightrope, balancing their desire to help with the risk of
making a costly mistake.</TE>
<TE>   Said Hartman, the Simi Valley orthopedist: "When a season ends
with no major injuries, every time that happens it's a big sigh of
relief."</TE>

<LD>I drove to Westwood this week to write a story about the UCLA
football team.</LD>
<LD>   I did not drive to a field.</LD>
<LD>   I drove to a bar.</LD>
<TE>   Instead of standing on the sidelines, I was sitting on a stool.</TE>
<TE>   Instead of talking to a quarterback holding a football, I was
chatting with a bartender who was downing a shot.</TE>
<TE>   The place was Madison's Neighborhood Grill, famous for burgers and
dollar beer and UCLA football players who brawl in the parking lot.</TE>
<TE>   Twice this spring, players were arrested for fighting outside
here, with guard Shane Lehmann pleading no contest to a misdemeanor
battery charge and Ricky Manning Jr. still facing a felony charge.</TE>
<TE>   In this growing Bruin storm that seemingly emits new thunderclaps
each week, Madison's represents the booze-and-sweat-soaked center.</TE>
<TE>   Or, at least, it was.</TE>
<TE>   On this weeknight, during a stroll past the wooden tables and
fuzzy televisions, there are no UCLA players to be found.</TE>
<TE>   Coach Bob Toledo has forbidden them to return.</TE>
<TE>   One unnamed bystander said they wouldn't be welcome anyway.</TE>
<TE>   "They are a bunch of guys with attitudes," he said. "A lot of
them, if they weren't playing football, they would be on the streets.
They bring us nothing but bad publicity, and we'd rather have no
publicity."</TE>
<TE>   An unfair generalization, certainly. But maybe this guy is guilty
only of reading the newspaper.</TE>
<TE>   The Bruins have had two new arrest revelations in two weeks.</TE>
<TE>   They have one defensive lineman waiting to go to jail, and another
awaiting trial. They've had one season ruined by driving, and another
ruined by parking.</TE>
<TE>   You want to talk football, but the recent Bruins have affected
their neighborhood in ways that have nothing to do with football.</TE>
<TE>   l ended my season preview by laying five dollars on a bar and
walking across a darkened, sticky floor that looked nothing like an

<TE>   The Bruins officially open their season Saturday night at the Rose
Bowl against Colorado State.</TE>
<TE>   But they are already 0-1.</TE>
<TE>   Accumulating over three seasons, their off-field problems have
finally stuck them for a loss in both their university and football
worlds.</TE>
<TE>   This is no longer about a couple of guys with handicapped-parking
placards, or a kid who hides a drunk-driving conviction, or a
neighborhood scrape.</TE>
<TE>   Like two guys tumbling into a Westwood street, this has spilled
over into the image of an entire university community.</TE>
<TE>   "What has happened to the football team is a blemish on more than
just the team and institution," said Dr. Reef Karim, a UCLA
psychiatrist and behavioral specialist. "Scandals like these, in this
college environment, affect a collective identity."</TE>
<TE>   Michael Young, former Bruin and pro wide receiver who works in the
Denver Broncos' front office, said the ramifications might extend
even beyond Westwood.</TE>
<TE>   "In the NFL, there's always been an underlying belief that UCLA
players are pretty smart, and pretty good citizens," he said. "I
would hope that they can quickly address and repair the situation so
this reputation does not change."</TE>
<TE>   Young said even losing seasons will not affect careers as much as
lost honor would.</TE>
<TE>   "Stuff on the field, you can remedy pretty quickly," he said. "But
a reputation is much harder to fix. Sometimes it takes years. I
remember how NFL people used to talk about a place like Miami.</TE>
<TE>   "For the sake of all the players who have spent years building up
that good reputation at UCLA, I hope the problems are solved."</TE>
<TE>   Toledo's mandate this season seems clear. If he can't get to the
Rose Bowl, then he must keep at least his players out of the thorns.</TE>
<TE>   Controlling his team isn't everything. It's the only thing.</TE>
<TE>   "It's important that all our coaches understand their role as
educators," new Athletic Director Dan Guerrero said, speaking
generally. "Some say sports are not academic; that does not mean they
are not educational."</TE>
<TE>   Toledo's future clearly rests on implementing this sort of
education. In his six years at UCLA, he has shown nothing but good
intentions. But if he's not careful, he's going to pave a road to
hell, or at least unemployment.</TE>
<TE>   "In the pros, if a guy messes up, it's about the individual,"
Karim said. "But in college, they are still in the learning process,
with everything from girlfriends to homework. So you have to look at
who is responsible for this learning. You have to look at who is
teaching them."</TE>
<TE>   Guerrero is so concerned about the issue that he has met with the
team and its veteran player council.</TE>
<TE>   "There is not one person in this program who is not concerned, and
everything is being done to make sure certain steps are taken," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   But as most agree, nobody can take those steps like the coach,
whose public summer crackdown apparently has kept his team out of
trouble since the start of training camp.</TE>
<TE>   For the sake of Toledo, here's hoping that trend continues.</TE>
<TE>   After six years of acting like a father to his players, it's time
he also became their teacher.</TE>

<DH>High schools: In wake of player deaths, preparedness for
medical emergencies improves only slightly.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In a span of five weeks last fall, four athletes from Southern
California high schools died during or after competitions and
practices. Matt Colby, 17, a football linebacker for Costa Mesa High,
passed out shortly after taking himself out of a game complaining of
a headache. He was taken off life support the next morning, Sept. 29,
having never regained consciousness.</LD>
<LD>   The same day, Jason Kortekaas, 17, a runner for Victorville
Silverado, was stricken while racing over a three-mile desert
cross-country course in temperatures near 100 degrees. He slipped
into a coma and died 11 days later.</LD>
<LD>   Jonathan Diaz, 17, a football lineman for Wilmington Banning,
broke down as he walked through plays during a practice on a cool,
overcast afternoon on Nov. 12 and could not be revived.</LD>
<TE>   Four days after Diaz died, Ryan King, 16, a soccer player for
Manhattan Beach Mira Costa, collapsed after jogging a warmup lap at
the start of a practice.</TE>
<TE>   Colby died from bleeding and swelling in the brain that medical
examiners said was probably caused by blows to the head while playing
football. Kortekaas, Diaz and King had heart ailments.</TE>
<TE>   All four had this much more in common: Their deaths, and other
highly publicized tragedies on athletic fields nationwide, prompted
many of the same questions. Who determines athletes are healthy
enough to compete? Who is entrusted to provide medical care? Would
additional safety measures have saved them?</TE>
<TE>   As another high school sports season begins, The Times found that
little has changed regarding health care and safety in the nearly one
year since these deaths.</TE>
<TE>   There have been some improvements. The Los Angeles Unified School
District, in response to the fatal heart problems, has joined a few
other smaller districts in the region in purchasing heart
defibrillation units for each of its campuses. Also, officials are
hoping a new football helmet that became available this year will
help curb the number of concussions.</TE>
<TE>   But elsewhere, advances are coming more slowly. Many schools still
don't have medical personnel on campus for practices and will be
forced to scramble to provide coverage for games. Indeed, instead of
more medical professionals volunteering to help, some are turning
away--concerned that they are not qualified to diagnose maladies
outside their expertise and worried that they might be held
financially responsible if a mistake is made.</TE>
<TE>   Today's stories:</TE>
<TE>   * Doctors give some preseason physicals failing grades. D14</TE>
<TE>   * Health care experts call trainers a necessity, but at many
schools they are still a luxury. D14</TE>
<TE>   * A "Revolution" in football helmet safety? D15</TE>
<TE>   * Schools are getting wired to fight heart ailments. D14</TE>

<HD>Annacone's Two-Step Program Saves Sampras</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Diane Pucin</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>"Let's go."</LD>
<LD>   It was that simple, a two-word command from Paul Annacone to Pete
Sampras.</LD>
<LD>   "OK," Sampras said.</LD>
<TE>   It was that simple, a one-word acknowledgment that the athlete was
happy to have the old coach back.</TE>
<TE>   Sampras--sprightly, bouncy, running on his toes and gliding easily
to the net; bouncing serves into every nook and cranny of the box or
into the body or off a line; clocking his forehand with verve and
power; curling his backhand neatly onto the baseline--knocked brash
Andy Roddick out of the U.S. Open Thursday night.</TE>
<TE>   Even though Roddick was seeded No. 11 and Sampras No. 17, even
though Roddick is 20 and Sampras 31, even though Roddick had beaten
the four-time U.S. Open champion in their only two previous meetings,
it would not have been unreasonable for someone to pick Sampras to
beat Roddick in the last of the men's quarterfinals.</TE>
<TE>   But no one predicted this, a 6-3, 6-2, 6-4 clubbing. Not in 1 hour
30 minutes. Not with Roddick getting only one break-point chance
(which wasn't converted). Not with Sampras running the young gun to
distraction, to snarling chats with the chair umpire and moody
monologues with himself.</TE>
<TE>   This was, as Jim Courier said, a butt-kicking, a lesson in tennis
nuance. Roddick can serve hard. Sampras can serve hard and smart.
Roddick can hit a big forehand. Sampras can hit a forehand big,
medium and soft plus a one-handed backhand that moves. Roddick can't
get his feet to do the quick-step dance to the net. Sampras scampered
always forward and drove his volleys deep or dropped them short and
angled.</TE>
<TE>   We didn't see this coming.</TE>
<TE>   Annacone did.</TE>
<TE>   Too many thought Sampras was two steps slow and one step from the
tennis grave.</TE>
<TE>   Annacone didn't.</TE>
<TE>   "I think sometimes we believe everything we read and see,"
Annacone said. "What Pete showed tonight is that he doesn't believe
everything he reads and sees. Pete is a terrific talent and that
talent wasn't gone. It needed to be reawakened."</TE>
<TE>   For nearly seven years Sampras and Annacone had been the perfect
pair. Annacone pushed, but not too much; tinkered, but only when
necessary.</TE>
<TE>   It was a delicate place for Annacone at the beginning. Sampras had
been devoted to Tim Gullikson, who had helped create Sampras' belief
in his ability to win on Wimbledon's grass. When Gullikson was
diagnosed with the brain cancer that would kill him, Sampras turned
to Annacone, a quiet man, which suited Sampras, and a good friend,
which suited Annacone.</TE>
<TE>   But at the end of the 2001 season, after Sampras had gone 15
months without a tournament win, with the losses making Sampras
grumpy and Annacone frustrated, Sampras called his coach and asked
him to be only a friend. That was fine with Annacone.</TE>
<TE>   "I think Paul and I, professionally, probably hit a point where we
needed to take a break from each other," Sampras said.</TE>
<TE>   "I'd agree with that," Annacone said. "It is important to take
breaks from people. Then sometimes you appreciate what you have after
you don't have it. I did. I think maybe Pete did a little bit too."</TE>
<TE>   After Sampras had his second-round flameout at Wimbledon, a bad,
stumbling loss to George Bastl, Annacone was sad and Sampras was
distraught.</TE>
<TE>   "It was painful to see," Annacone said. "And really bad for Pete.
It is hard to watch someone that great, such a great athlete, be in
that place. So I asked Pete, 'Do you want to wallow around in
mediocrity or use this to motivate yourself to becoming Pete again?'
"</TE>
<TE>   When Greg Rusedski, after losing to Sampras in five sets last
week, suggested Sampras had lost a step and a half, the timing might
have been bad for Rusedski but the thought had been expressed by many
other players.</TE>
<TE>   "His speed looked fine to me tonight," Annacone said. "Jim Courier
said to me after this match that Pete's speed is all about his
confidence and if his confidence is there, Pete moves great. Believe
me, Pete still has the wheels when he needs to use them."</TE>
<TE>   For a night, Sampras did move with more purpose than he has in the
year since he beat Andre Agassi on the same court in the same round
of the Open. But the first step isn't as explosive as it used to be,
and Sampras can't always get that rocket burst after his serve, that
athletic push to the net that always left him in perfect position to
strike the perfect volley.</TE>
<TE>   As Sampras and Roddick came onto the Arthur Ashe Stadium court,
and "Glory Days," the Bruce Springsteen song, was piped in loud, it
seemed to be an anthem of what had been for Sampras and what was to
come for Roddick.</TE>
<TE>   Except that Sampras has summoned, over these last 10 days, the
athlete within himself. With Annacone back in his corner, Sampras has
pulled back the covers and found his confidence.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not the reason Pete is doing well now," Annacone said. "And I
wasn't the reason he was doing poorly. All I've done is help trigger
what was inside him."</TE>
<TE>   In Thursday night's first game, Sampras held his serve at love,
hitting an ace and a forehand winner. And in the second game, Sampras
broke Roddick from the baseline, with a backhand winner.</TE>
<TE>   After two games, Sampras had exposed Roddick as a young man who,
on this night, seemed awestruck by the occasion and by the opponent.
By the end, Roddick was grunting in anguish as he lunged for Sampras'
corner-driven shots and pulling at his spiky hair. There were no
dives into the crowd to accept high-fives, no dramatic exclamations
of joy.</TE>
<TE>   After the last point, a cruel drop volley by Sampras, Roddick came
to the net, gave Sampras a hug and whispered "Too good."</TE>
<TE>   "I got beat. By Pete," Roddick said. By Pete, by a sore foot that
may have hampered his movement, by the occasion, and most of all by
the ghost of Pete past, which has been summoned to the present by
Annacone.</TE>
<TE>   "Andy seemed a little bit low," Sampras said. That was kind.
Mostly what happened to Roddick was that he had to play the old Pete,
new again. For another night.</TE>

<LD>The search for Mexico's next national team coach may lead to a
familiar face.</LD>
<LD>   Former coach Manuel Lapuente's name has been thrown into the
hopper of potential replacements for Javier Aguirre, who resigned to
take over Spain's Club Atletico Osasuna after jump-starting a
foundering Mexico and leading it into the second round of the World
Cup this summer.</LD>
<LD>   Others mentioned are former Mexican player Hugo Sanchez and four
foreigners, Argentine Carlos Bianchi, and Dutchmen Guus Hiddink,
Johan Cruyff and Leo Beenhakker.</LD>
<TE>   Alberto de la Torre, the Mexican Federation president, has
confirmed that he has talked to three candidates.</TE>
<TE>   Lapuente, who resigned under fire as coach in September of 2000,
after Mexico failed to win the Gold Cup and had missed qualifying for
the Olympics, is the coach of Club America. He is on medical leave
but is expected to return in less than a month.</TE>
<TE>   A Hard-Hitting Tome</TE>
<TE>   Roy Keane's controversial autobiography, in which the Manchester
United captain acknowledges having tried to hurt Manchester City's
Alf Inge Haaland, did more than earn Keane two charges of misconduct
from the Football Assn. Manchester United warned its players to
refrain from writing such tell-all memoirs while with the team.</TE>
<TE>   "We need to make it clear that we don't think it's appropriate for
players to publish a book while they're still playing for Manchester
United," the team's managing director, David Gill, said Thursday on
the club's Web site. "We want them to concentrate on playing. We
believe they can do other commercial deals. David Beckham's doing
Castrol and Pepsi. Roy Keane does Aer Lingus. That's fine. A book is
another issue."</TE>
<TE>   In his book, Keane said he'd planned to injure Haaland because
Haaland, while playing for Leeds United, had accused Keane of faking
an injury in a game four years earlier.</TE>
<TE>   Haaland injured knee ligaments in Keane's revenge at the
Manchester Derby in April 2001 and has not played a full game since.</TE>
<TE>   "I'd waited long enough [to get revenge]," Keane said in his book,
before recounting his words to a fallen Haaland: " 'And don't ever
stand over me again sneering about fake injuries ... and tell your
pal [David] Wetherall there's some for him as well.' "</TE>
<TE>   Keane has since said that he never intentionally set out to hurt
opponents and that his words were paraphrased by the ghostwriter who
did the book.</TE>
<TE>   The FA, though, was not amused and has issued a statement,
explaining why Keane was charged with two counts of bringing the game
into disrepute for the same play.</TE>
<TE>   "The first charge follows the challenge itself on Haaland, which
is now alleged to have been improperly motivated with an apparent
element of revenge," the statement read. "The second charge relates
to Roy Keane allegedly publishing for financial profit or reward an
account in his autobiography in which he speaks of his desire to
exact revenge on Haaland, therefore bringing the game into
disrepute."</TE>
<TE>   Keane, who earned his 10th red card over the weekend and underwent
hip surgery Tuesday, has 14 days to respond to the charges.</TE>

seen Pete Sampras and Andre Agassi. There's a comfort level in
knowing what we'll get when Agassi and Sampras step on the court.</LD>

could not hold its own against the best matchup in the game. Sampras
never let Roddick breathe, much less see him sweat, immediately
smothering him with power and precision in their quarterfinal at the
U.S. Open on Thursday night.</TE>
<TE>   The 17th-seeded Sampras faced only one break point, quickly
erasing it in the second set, and breezed to a 6-3, 6-2, 6-4 victory
against No. 11 Roddick in 90 minutes. He had 13 aces, giving him 40
in his last two matches.</TE>
<TE>   The present is still holding serve.</TE>
<TE>   This came after a disliked colleague, Greg Rusedski, put the
31-year-old Sampras' game in mothballs Monday. Others were agreeing
with him, looking at the Sampras who lost on grass to Alex Corretja
in Davis Cup and George Bastl at Wimbledon.</TE>
<TE>   "Absolutely, it fired me up," said Sampras, who will play Sjeng
Schalken of the Netherlands in the semifinals on Saturday. Defending
champion Lleyton Hewitt of Australia will face Agassi in the other
semifinal.</TE>
<TE>   Schalken defeated Fernando Gonzalez of Chile in a marathon 3-hour
43-minute quarterfinal, 6-7 (5), 6-3, 6-3, 6-7 (5), 7-6 (2).</TE>
<TE>   If Schalken is an unexpected guest in the final four, Sampras was
not exactly a given, either. He has not won a tournament since
Wimbledon 2000, and the players were almost circling his aura like
vultures.</TE>
<TE>   Paul Annacone, the longtime coach and confidant of Sampras, looked
at the quotes from Rusedski. As a person, he was appalled. But the
pragmatist in Annacone rubbed his hands.</TE>
<TE>   "For me, as a coach, it's great motivation," Annacone said. "He'll
use that to help him."</TE>
<TE>   During his prolonged slump, Sampras often seemed unable to
establish a quick lead, letting the opponent hang around too long,
which is how he even got into trouble against the likes of Bastl.</TE>
<TE>   Here, the hammer came down quickly and stayed there. He won the
first seven points of the match and broke Roddick in the second game,
at 30. Sampras won the first set with uncommon speed, in 27 minutes,
hitting a 101-mph service winner, and lost only four points on his
serve in the opening set.</TE>
<TE>   Roddick's only break-point chance was in the second game of the
second set and Sampras saved it with a forehand volley. In the next
game, Roddick was broken at love, hitting two double faults. He had
only three for the whole match.</TE>
<TE>   "I gave him a little bit of a gift, a lot of a gift, in that
game," Roddick said. "Played one sloppy game in the third set, and
two sloppy games, if someone's playing well, can make you look pretty
bad sometimes."</TE>
<TE>   The emotional, often theatrical Roddick was not in evidence.
Sampras, who is 20-0 in night matches at the U.S. Open, was the one
pumping his fists and jogging to his chair on changeovers. He
relished the prime-time moment, rather than being frozen by it.</TE>
<TE>   "This is what I play for," Sampras said. "These are the big
moments, playing Andy in a night match. He's the young up-and-comer
that has a great future.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm pumped up. There's no question, I kind of feed off the energy
of playing at night here."</TE>
<TE>   Roddick, who hurt his left foot in the third round against
Corretja, seemed almost lost at times. His backhand passing shot went
missing in almost the same way it did against Rusedski at Wimbledon.</TE>
<TE>   "It's funny, if I win a match, it's improving and it's so solid
and it's great and it's grand and it's wonderful," the 20-year-old
said of his backhand and volleys. "As soon as there's a bad match
with it, it's terrible and it [stinks] and you know, useless and
whatever. Take your pick."</TE>
<TE>   Said Tarik Benhabiles, Roddick's coach: "Pete was better. He
[Roddick] wasn't in it. It's happened. It's hard to explain. It's
going to take a few days to realize what happened. But basically he
wasn't there. There's a lot to learn, a lot, a lot. Trust me."</TE>
<TE>   Roddick had defeated Sampras twice in two meetings, including the
final at Houston on clay in March. But this was shortly after one of
Sampras' lowest periods, the stunning loss to Corretja on grass.</TE>
<TE>   "There [were] points this year where I was second-guessing and
just not that confident," Sampras said. "It showed at times. And guys
are getting a little better. They don't have that fear factor. It
just accumulated."</TE>
<TE>   The path of 2001, in which he beat Patrick Rafter and Agassi on
his way to the Open final, had the same smooth upward glide of
anticipation as his current run.</TE>
<TE>   "Now I feel like I'm in pretty good rhythm, everything's
clicking," Sampras said. "You kind of wait for it. I've been pretty
patient all year, finally for it to kind of click. It's nice that
it's happening here."</TE>
<TE>   It will be the first Grand Slam semifinal for Schalken, who
survived the powerful forehand and serve of Gonzalez.</TE>
<TE>   "It was not easy because he started, and I thought I was in the
middle of a hurricane," Schalken said. "He made some choices I didn't
expect. I told myself that I was down, 7-6, and he hit second serves
over 120 miles per hour, then a drop shot, the weirdest balls. I
thought, 'If he's going to play like this in my quarterfinal, I
cannot make it.' "</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The climate was mild; the test, a relatively tame agility drill, the
kind thousands of high school football players complete every day
during summer practice.</LD>
<LD>   Then, suddenly, Jason Chamberlin sprawled on the Glendale High
field, unresponsive. And there was nobody with medical training
around to help.</LD>
<LD>   The football team's certified athletic trainer, paid through a
program funded by a local hospital to attend practices 10 hours a
week, had skipped the session in favor of covering other workouts.</LD>
<TE>   All school officials could do in her absence was check
Chamberlin's blood pressure, put a blanket over him and call 911. By
the time the sophomore got to a hospital, his body temperature was
107 degrees. He had heatstroke.</TE>
<TE>   Two weeks later, Chamberlin was in class for the first day of
school. His prognosis for a full recovery is good, and he hopes to
return soon to his place on Glendale's offensive line. But his ordeal
underscores a danger that continues to plague high school athletics:
the lack of consistent medical supervision and care.</TE>
<TE>   In a recent survey of officials from 905 California high schools,
only 62% said they had trainers on campus--and only 35% of those
trainers were certified.</TE>
<TE>   "The people who might have the wherewithal to fund certified
athletic trainers at the high school level don't realize the positive
impact they have in terms of catastrophic injuries and the rate of
injuries," said Dr. Keith Feder, the Manhattan Beach orthopedic
surgeon who conducted the survey.</TE>
<TE>   Feder, who is active in high school sports, said multiple
independent studies have found that a full-time, certified trainer
can reduce injuries by 30% to 40%.</TE>
<TE>   As things are, the health of high school athletes is "being
compromised every day because people are not put in a position to
protect them," said Julie Max, Cal State Fullerton's head trainer and
president of the National Athletic Trainers Assn.</TE>
<TE>   Because the responsibility for medical care rests with individual
schools or districts rather than a regional or state entity, the
quality of coverage varies widely. Many school administrators say
they would like to implement trainer programs but are hampered by a
harsh economic climate.</TE>
<TE>   "It's an issue we have talked about at the district level for a
number of years," said Barbara Fiege, director of athletics for the
Los Angeles Unified School District. "The huge obstacle is funding."</TE>
<TE>   Feder believes that in the past year there has been little to no
increase in training supervision at Southern California schools
despite the deaths of four local high school athletes last fall. He
has no specific data supporting his assertion, but bases it on the
high number of phone calls from school officials to his office
requesting assistance from his volunteer community program, Team to
Win.</TE>
<TE>   The program, based at Centinela Hospital, provides certified
trainers who attend practices and football games at 24 high schools
and offers follow-up care to about 12,000 athletes. Most of the
trainers work 12-15 hours a week--two practices and a game--during
the football season. Feder estimates the program, funded by donations
and subsidized by Centinela, costs about $1 million a year.</TE>
<TE>   Feder said a shortage of funds isn't the only reason more schools
aren't using certified trainers. Other factors, he said, are a
scarcity of qualified practitioners and an unwillingness among health
care professionals to work for anything less than the going rate.</TE>
<TE>   "In our program, the physicians have to take a reduced rate of
remuneration for their services or do it on a volunteer basis," Feder
said. "We know as physicians that the funding is not out there to pay
at the level at which we're accustomed for these high school kids."</TE>
<TE>   If there is a model training program in the Southland, it's
offered by the Anaheim Union High School District, which has a paid
certified athletic trainer for each of its eight campuses that offers
a full complement of sports.</TE>
<TE>   Anaheim trainers are well paid because they double as teachers.
The district offers its trainers a yearly stipend of $6,237--in
addition to a teaching salary that starts as high as $49,553 for
those who have attained a master's degree and have completed 60 hours
of additional coursework.</TE>
<TE>   "They can't go anywhere else and make that wage," said Tom Danley,
the district's athletic director. "That has turned some heads."</TE>
<TE>   When the program started five years ago, district principals were
given three years to hire teachers who were also certified athletic
trainers. These were not new positions; the trainers filled vacancies
created by attrition.</TE>
<TE>   While acknowledging that it has been difficult to always find
prospects who can fill the dual role, Danley said the district has
formed a pipeline with universities that offer athletic training
programs. Cal State Fullerton is among them.</TE>
<TE>   "We try to meet the needs of the high schools by providing
certified athletics trainers and encouraging them to get teaching
credentials as soon as they [graduate]," said Max, Fullerton's
trainer.</TE>
<TE>   The arrangement is one other medical professionals would like
their local districts to adopt. Los Alamitos physical therapist
Andrew Einhorn said he has been trying to coax the Garden Grove
Unified School District to follow suit--to no avail.</TE>
<TE>   "This is not something we've made up," said Einhorn, who has gone
on television and radio shows to promote the concept. "This is
happening already."</TE>
<TE>   Alan Trudell, spokesman for the Garden Grove district, called
Einhorn's proposal "rather unrealistic, particularly for our
district. When we hire teachers, we look for the best teachers. His
proposal is looking for trainers first and looking for the teacher
[as a secondary requirement]."</TE>
<TE>   Trudell said principals in his district have discretion to adjust
their athletic budgets, which provide funding for up to 45 coaching
positions per school, to pay for athletic trainers if they so desire.</TE>
<TE>   But Einhorn, who has volunteered to assist Garden Grove Pacifica
High's team doctor during football games for 18 seasons, said what is
needed is a mandate. He has seen the potentially devastating
consequences of not having a trainer on a sideline.</TE>
<TE>   During a Pacifica football game several years ago, a player from
the opposing team dislocated his shoulder. Because the team did not
have any medical personnel with it, Einhorn said, it was up to the
Pacifica doctor to reduce the dislocation. Einhorn said the doctor
advised the player that he "was done for the night" and needed to
seek follow-up care.</TE>
<TE>   Einhorn later learned that the player reentered the game.</TE>
<TE>   "That was an absolute breach of medical care," Einhorn said. "It's
a frightening thing."</TE>
<TE>   Kerrie Smith, Glendale High's football trainer, doesn't know if
she would have made a substantial difference had she been on the
sideline when Chamberlin collapsed. But she is confident of her
impact had his condition deteriorated.</TE>
<TE>   "I could have cooled him down and made sure he was breathing. I
could have maintained his vital signs," she said. "From what I was
told, no one really knew what to do. They were like, 'Call 911.' "</TE>

<HD>CBS Remodels NFL Pregame</HD>

<SE></SE>
<AU>LARRY STEWART</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>With the beginning of the NFL season, viewers are going to see a lot
of different faces in different places.</LD>
<LD>   CBS has revamped its cast for "The NFL Today." Gone are Mike
Ditka, Jerry Glanville and Randy Cross. Newcomers are Dan Marino,
Boomer Esiason and Deion Sanders, who joined the show five games into
last season.</LD>
<LD>   "We now have a pregame show that can challenge the guys out on the
West Coast as they've never been challenged before," says CBS Sports
President Sean McManus.</LD>
<TE>   Fox's Los Angeles-based "Fox NFL Sunday" remains intact, except
for Cris Collinsworth, who has joined Joe Buck and Troy Aikman on the
network's lead game-announcing team. Also, Jimmy Johnson, an original
member of the show, returns as an in-studio guest analyst the first
three weeks of the season.</TE>
<TE>   Everything about the Fox Sports Net pregame show has been changed,
from the cast to the name to the time slot. The 90-minute "NFL Show"
will air Saturday nights after Pacific 10 football and will be
repeated Sunday mornings at 7:30.</TE>
<TE>   Host Chris Myers will be joined by Tony Siragusa, Michael Irvin,
D'Marco Farr and comedian Tommy Davidson, who is best known for his
work on "In Living Color." Gone are Marv Levy, Deacon Jones, Esiason
and Jay Mohr. The biggest loss is Levy. He always had something witty
to say.</TE>
<TE>   The revamped show will include dancers, a live band, comedic high
jinks similar to what one sees on the "Best Damn Sports Show Period,"
and a studio audience. The first show includes a skit featuring
Davidson at Junior Seau's restaurant in San Diego.</TE>
<TE>   Time permitting, there even may be a little football commentary.</TE>
<TE>   ESPN's "NFL Sunday Countdown" has a new set, Bill Parcells is now
a full-time member of the cast and John Madden will have a segment
with Chris Berman each week. Parcells also will moonlight for the
Sporting News Network, again doing his weekly show, which will be
carried by KMPC (1540) Fridays at 6 p.m., beginning today.</TE>
<TE>   HBO's "Inside the NFL," which makes its debut next Thursday at 8
p.m., is another show that has been revamped. Gone are longtime
fixtures Len Dawson and Nick Buoniconti. The new cast includes
holdovers Marino and Collinsworth plus newcomers Bob Costas, the
host, and Cris Carter.</TE>
<TE>   Look for Carter to emerge as a star.</TE>
<TE>   He was in Los Angeles recently, helping DirecTV promote its NFL
Sunday Ticket pay package, and was particularly impressive during a
lunch interview. The former wide receiver is glib, intelligent,
pleasant and not afraid to express an opinion.</TE>
<TE>   HBO President Ross Greenburg said, "We feel he can have a Charles
Barkley-like presence."</TE>
<TE>   Helping the Enemy</TE>
<TE>   Fox Sports Net commentator Tom Ramsey knew he and Steve Physioc
would be announcing Saturday night's Colorado State-UCLA game because
it is Fox Sports Net's national Pac-10 game of the week. So the
former UCLA quarterback, who now lives in the Denver area, went out
to a Colorado State practice in Fort Collins 2 1/2 weeks ago to take
a look at the Rams.</TE>
<TE>   He was impressed and told Coach Sonny Lubick how he felt. Lubick
in turn asked Ramsey to stick around and tell the team the same thing
after practice. Ramsey reluctantly agreed.</TE>
<TE>   It must have been quite a pep talk. The Rams are 2-0 and coming
off a big win over Colorado.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't regard the win over Colorado as an upset," Ramsey said.
"Colorado State is that good."</TE>
<TE>   Now that the Rams are facing Ramsey's alma mater, maybe Coach Bob
Toledo should ask him to give his team a pep talk too, just to
balance things out.</TE>
<TE>   More College Football</TE>
<TE>   NBC televises its first Notre Dame game of the season Saturday at
10 a.m. when the Irish play host to Purdue. The announcers will be
Tom Hammond and Pat Haden.</TE>
<TE>   Before re-signing with NBC, Haden was considering an offer from
Turner Broadcasting, which used to employ him as an NFL announcer.
Turner's TBS begins televising Pac-10 and Big 12 games Sept. 14 and
wanted Haden.</TE>
<TE>   Speaking of Haden and Ramsey, these two guys not only sound alike,
they also are two of the best in the business.</TE>
<TE>   Ramsey is among a long line of former UCLA quarterbacks who have
excelled in broadcasting. Look where Aikman is. David Norrie works
for ABC. Matt Stevens is UCLA's radio commentator. And now Wayne Cook
is getting into the business. He'll be part of the Bruin pregame and
postgame shows on flagship station KXTA (1150).</TE>
<TE>   The Bruin radio network consists of 15 other stations, some in
such faraway places as Maui, Albuquerque, Las Vegas and Reno.</TE>
<TE>   As a test, Regal CineMedia Corp. (RCM) is televising the Colorado
State-UCLA game in high definition at the Edwards Theaters Irvine
Spectrum Megaplex. Tickets are $10 for adults, $8 for students and $6
for children. RCM is also showing the game at three locations in the
Denver area.</TE>
<TE>   Tragic Event</TE>
<TE>   Cameraman Brian Blodgett, 37, of Jacksonville, Fla., died Tuesday
from injuries suffered in a freak accident while filming a golf event
in the Monterey area.</TE>
<TE>   "Brian was a well-respected member of the golf community, and that
extended family shares deeply in this most tragic loss," said Frank
Chirkinian, the president of Gaylord Event Television, which employed
Blodgett. He was a cameraman for all 42 of the "Shell's Wonderful
World of Golf" matches since the series was revived in 1994.</TE>
<TE>   On Tuesday, Blodgett was set up on a platform on a forklift
shooting a Shell match between Fred Couples and Mark Calcavecchia
when the forklift toppled over on an uneven stretch of ground.</TE>
<TE>   Blodgett is survived by his wife of five months, Kelly, 32.</TE>
<TE>   Short Waves</TE>
<TE>   Former Trojans Tim Ryan and Mark Carrier are rookie NFL
commentators for Fox. Former Bruin Ron Pitts has gone from field
reporter to play-by-play.... The NFL Celebrity Shootout, taped at La
Costa, will be televised by Fox on Saturday at 10:30 a.m.... A new
daily show featuring four sports columnists from different regions
will make its debut on ESPN Oct. 28. Max Kellerman will serve as host
of "Around the Horn," which will air weekdays at 2 p.m. The Times'
T.J. Simers will be one of the four columnists.... Chris McCarron
will serve as a guest commentator on "Trackside Live" from Del Mar
Saturday and Sunday on Fox Sports Net 2.... Fox Sports Net 2 also
will carry TVG's coverage of the mule match race between Black Ruby
and Taz Sunday night at 6.</TE>
<TE>   "NBA Inside Stuff," formerly on NBC, makes its debut on ABC
Saturday at 11:30 a.m.... Shaquille O'Neal's charity roast of Emmitt
Smith, taped in Las Vegas in June, begins airing as a pay-per-view
event on digital cable and DirecTV Saturday. Proceeds go to
charity.... SlamBall concludes its first season with the championship
game on TNN Saturday at 8 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   Roger Lodge, host of the popular "Blind Date" syndicated show,
concludes a successful three-week run as fill-in sports talk show
host with Bob Golic on KMPC today. Lodge is knowledgeable, smooth and

<KH>UCLA REPORT</KH>
<HD>He's One, and Only, for Bruins</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Steve Henson</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Colorado State has 36 players from California. UCLA has one from
Colorado.</LD>
<LD>   The relatives and friends of Jon Dubravac scattered around the
Rocky Mountains will be glued to televisions, discreetly rooting for
the Bruins, or at least for one particular receiver coming off a back
injury that sidelined him all last season.</LD>
<LD>   Dubravac was all-state at Mullen High in Denver, making 111
catches and getting scholarship offers from Colorado and Colorado
State. He followed his cousin, Joe Dubravac, to UCLA and has been a
perennial honor student and dependable possession receiver.</LD>
<TE>   "When I was in high school, Colorado State was just beginning to
become a strong program," he said. "Colorado was the powerhouse."</TE>
<TE>   Growing up, he attended the games of both schools. So seeing them
on this season's UCLA schedule (Colorado visits UCLA on Sept. 21 for
a 12:30 p.m. game) excited him, especially because he is injury-free.</TE>
<TE>   "It's very cool," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "People at home will have a chance to see me play on TV, to see
I'm still alive."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Nobody calls them the Orange Crush. That moniker was adopted by
the Denver Bronco defense during the 1970s.</TE>
<TE>   But the Colorado State defensive line has a decidedly Orange
tint--three members have ties to Orange County.</TE>
<TE>   Senior end Peter Hogan, from Newport Harbor High, has seven sacks
the last two seasons. Junior end Andre Sommersell, from Fountain
Valley, is a speed rusher who had two sacks and a blocked punt last
season. Junior nose tackle Bryan Save, who lives in Santa Ana,
started the last four games of the 2001 season and returned a fumble
for a touchdown against Brigham Young.</TE>
<TE>   Patrick Goodpaster and Lavell Mann, who share time at defensive
tackle, grew up not far from each other. Goodpaster, a sophomore, is
from Harbor City and attended Narbonne High. Mann, a junior, went to
Lakewood High and Long Beach City College.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Freshman safety Eric McNeal, one of UCLA's most highly touted
recruits, was expected to play immediately. But he probably will
redshirt after injuring his hip in practice this week.</TE>
<TE>   "He was going to play on special teams," Coach Bob Toledo said.
"Now it's cloudy because of the injury."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   UCLA has beefed up security for home games. The only containers
allowed into the Rose Bowl are purses, diaper bags and sealed water
containers.</TE>
<TE>   All items will be searched, and fans might be subject to full
searches of their person. Gates to the stadium open two hours before
kickoff.</TE>

<HD>Holmes, Guenther Split Time</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Gary Klein</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Tight ends Alex Holmes and Gregg Guenther went into USC's season
opener against Auburn listed as co- No. 1s on the depth chart.</LD>
<LD>   Each blocked adequately in the Trojans' 24-17 victory--and each
failed to catch a pass. Guenther dropped a ball. Holmes did not grab
one Trojan coaches thought was within reach.</LD>
<LD>   The competition for the majority of playing time continues.</LD>
<TE>   "We'll just go and keep splitting it until something separates
them," USC Coach Pete Carroll said Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   Holmes, a 6-foot-3, 265-pound junior, caught 22 passes for 166
yards and two touchdowns last season. Guenther, a 6-8, 245-pound
redshirt sophomore, was recovering from back surgery most of last
season and did not play in any games.</TE>
<TE>   "I got excited because I knew I had a little room to run, but I
tried to run without the ball and that's the first thing you can't
do," Guenther said of his first-quarter drop. "So it's a lesson
learned.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not going to happen again."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Redshirt sophomore Matt Cassel appeared on track to unseat
redshirt sophomore Matt Leinart as the No. 2 quarterback before
cornerbacks Marcell Allmond and Justin Wyatt intercepted passes
thrown by Cassel during drills.</TE>
<TE>   "Matt Cassel struggled out there today and Matt Leinart looked
pretty good," Carroll said.</TE>
<TE>   Competition at quarterback, cornerback and along the offensive and
defensive lines will continue today before the Trojans take Saturday
and Sunday off.</TE>
<TE>   Carroll is particularly concerned about depth at defensive end.
Junior college transfers Daniel Urquhart and Van Brown remain works
in progress as backups to Kenechi Udeze and Omar Nazel.</TE>
<TE>   "We're kind of holding our breath a little bit until one of those
guys takes over and really knows what he's doing," Carroll said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   With Keary Colbert resting a sore knee and Mike Williams slowed by
back spasms, receiver Jason Mitchell made the most of his
opportunities, catching several long passes and making an impressive
run on a reverse.... Senior tailback Justin Fargas received treatment
for his hamstring strain, ran a series of light sprints and performed
stretching exercises on the track that circles the playing surface at
Cromwell Field. Fargas said he would be ready to practice next week.</TE>
<TE>   Senior offensive lineman Zach Wilson wore a sneaker instead of the
protective boot that encased his left foot since suffering a strain
on the first day of training camp. Wilson, who is expected to return
to practice next week, said he gave the device the boot. "I've been
in and out of it for the past week or so--this time I'm permanently
out of it," Wilson said. "I'm tired of walking on that thing."</TE>

<HD>Chinese AIDS Activist Is Being Detained by Police, Group
Says</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HENRY CHU</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>BEIJING</DL>
<LD>A veteran Chinese AIDS activist missing for nearly two weeks is in
police custody on suspicion of revealing "state secrets," a human
rights group said this week.</LD>
<LD>   Wan Yanhai, a visiting scholar at USC in 1997, has been
instrumental in publicizing China's growing AIDS crisis, an issue
about which the Communist government remains extremely sensitive.</LD>
<LD>   Although Wan has been active in AIDS work for a decade, he has
most recently come under scrutiny by authorities for his role in
uncovering details of the thousands of peasants in central China who
contracted the disease through the practice of selling blood.
Officials have tried to suppress news of the growing epidemic.</LD>
<TE>   Wan, who divides his time between China and Los Angeles, had been
missing since Aug. 24 after attending a screening of a gay-themed
movie at a Beijing bar. His friends and relatives have had no word of
him since and have been pressing police to take action on his
disappearance or to disclose his detention.</TE>
<TE>   The New York-based group Human Rights in China said Thursday that
a friend of Wan's was informed of his detention by the Ministry of
State Security. The group said Wan was being held pending
investigation into whether he leaked classified information during
the course of his work.</TE>
<TE>   In China, the definition of "state secrets" is broad and can be
applied to almost anything--even already-published statistics about
the infection rates for acquired immune deficiency syndrome. The law
regulating such "secrets" is often used by the authorities to clamp
down on dissidents.</TE>
<TE>   "I know my husband," Wan's wife, Su Zhaosheng, who lives in Los
Angeles, said in a prepared statement released by the rights group.
"Wan would not engage in any activity that is harmful to the country
and its people."</TE>
<TE>   Wan has earned recognition around the world for his efforts to
promote AIDS awareness and prevention. He was due to receive an award
in Canada this month for his work.</TE>
<TE>   His case comes at a sensitive time for China on both the domestic
and international fronts. In two months, the country is to hold its
quinquennial Communist Party congress, at which a major transfer of
the leadership is expected to take place. The Beijing regime is
always keen to silence dissent before such events and make an outward
show of unity.</TE>
<TE>   Also, President Jiang Zemin is scheduled to travel next month to
the U.S. to meet with President Bush for a one-day summit at Bush's
ranch in Crawford, Texas.</TE>
<TE>   Wan's case could cast a cloud over that visit. U.S. officials have
already brought up his case with the Chinese authorities, as have
human rights groups worldwide, such as Amnesty International. Wan, a
former public health official, has run afoul of the Chinese
government in the past. After starting an AIDS hotline in Beijing and
championing gay rights, he was kicked out of his official post by the
government in 1994.</TE>
<TE>   Since then, he has continued his work through a Web site and with
other like-minded activists.</TE>

<HD>Gunman Tries to Assassinate Afghan Leader</HD>
<DH>Asia: President Hamid Karzai escapes unhurt in Kandahar
violence that kills three, including the assailant. Hours earlier in
Kabul, twin blasts leave at least 24 dead.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRIS KRAUL and JOHN DANISZEWSKI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>KABUL, Afghanistan</DL>
<LD>A gunman tried unsuccessfully to kill President Hamid Karzai on
Thursday and was shot to death by the Afghan leader's U.S. military
bodyguards, just hours after two explosions in a crowded downtown
Kabul market area killed at least 24 people.</LD>
<LD>   Officials said they did not know whether the assassination attempt
in the southern city of Kandahar and the explosions here in the
capital were related. The violence shattered a fragile calm that had
prevailed here in recent weeks, and came just ahead of the one-year
anniversary of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.</LD>
<LD>   Kandahar's governor and an American bodyguard were wounded in the
shooting, though neither seriously, while three people were killed.
Karzai was unhurt, and later flew to Kabul on a U.S. aircraft.</LD>
<TE>   The would-be assassin was identified today by government officials
at the scene as Abdul Rahman of the Kajaki district in Helmand
province. Rahman joined Kandahar Gov. Gul Agha Sherzai's security
detail three weeks ago.</TE>
<TE>   No group took responsibility Thursday in either attack. Afghan
officials were quick to blame the day's violence on the Al Qaeda
terrorist network of Osama bin Laden.</TE>
<TE>   During a speech in Kentucky, President Bush said he was relieved
that Karzai was unhurt and pledged that the U.S. commitment to the
rebuilding of Afghanistan would continue.</TE>
<TE>   "We're not leaving," he said. "We want to help democracy flourish
in that region. And we're not leaving because there's still Al Qaeda
and their buddies roaming around."</TE>
<TE>   The attempt on Karzai, Afghanistan's transitional president, came
as he was leaving the governor's palace in Kandahar to visit a nearby
shrine that legend says contains the cloak of the prophet Muhammad.
As the president was getting into his car, an attacker dressed in an
Afghan military uniform opened fire from a motorcycle.</TE>
<TE>   "We were standing at the gates and saw Karzai wave," said witness
Sardar Mohammed, according to Associated Press. "Then I saw one guard
point a Kalashnikov [rifle] at Karzai and fire. There was a kid
behind him, and he grabbed the gunman from behind."</TE>
<TE>   Karzai's U.S. military bodyguards opened fire, killing the
assailant and two other people, Kandahar security chief Dur Mohammed
said.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. Central Command in Tampa, Fla., which is responsible for
forces in Afghanistan, confirmed Thursday that an American soldier
providing security for Karzai received minor injuries in the attack
and was in stable condition at a U.S. military hospital in the
Kandahar area.</TE>
<TE>   Sherzai received medical treatment for a slight wound to the neck,
Afghan officials said.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. Army Special Forces soldiers have been protecting Karzai
since July, after the still-unsolved killing of Afghan Vice President
Haji Abdul Qadir. They work alongside Karzai's bodyguards from the
Northern Alliance, an influential militia that overthrew the Taliban
last fall with the help of a U.S.-led multinational force.</TE>
<TE>   Intended Target Unclear</TE>
<TE>   Foreign Minister Abdullah told reporters Thursday that Karzai, who
was also in Kandahar for the wedding of his younger brother, was the
clear target of the assassination attempt. Initial reports had
suggested that the governor was the intended victim.</TE>
<TE>   Abdullah declared that "terrorists are behind both attacks."</TE>
<TE>   Suspicion also surrounded Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, a former prime
minister and renegade warlord with suspected Taliban links who
Wednesday reportedly declared a jihad, or holy struggle, against the
multinational forces still in Afghanistan that shore up the Karzai
government and hunt for Al Qaeda fighters.</TE>
<TE>   In a taped message sent to news organizations, Hekmatyar said U.S.
and other armed forces must leave Afghanistan if there is to be a
truly Islamist government.</TE>
<TE>   The assassination attempt came hours after the twin blasts in
Kabul, which also injured 120 people and gave rise to fears of
further terrorist strikes leading up to next week's anniversary of
the Sept. 11 attacks.</TE>
<TE>   The blasts occurred about 50 feet and three minutes apart in an
area crowded with shoppers and peddlers in Kabul's jewelry district.</TE>
<TE>   The first bomb, believed to have been placed on or under a
bicycle, went off on Poli Baghi Omomi street about 3 p.m. It injured
only one or two people and drew onlookers. The second and more
powerful bomb, placed in a Russian-made Moskvich car parked at a
nearby curb, mowed down many of those who had gathered.</TE>
<TE>   "There was a ball of fire and people were burning, then people
came running by bleeding very badly," said Mohammed Farooq, who runs
a watch and calculator shop across from the site. He was uninjured.
"Everyone started screaming and people were running away."</TE>
<TE>   The plaza was littered with the charred and twisted remains of the
Moskvich, as well as shoes, bicycles and fruit. Pools and trails of
blood were everywhere.</TE>
<TE>   Near the twisted chassis of the car that contained the explosive,
a mother dressed in a traditional Afghan burka wept inconsolably: "My
child was there. My God. My God."</TE>
<TE>   The force of the second explosion scattered shrapnel and broke
windows of adjoining buildings, including the Spinzar Hotel across
the street, showering glass down on passersby. The hotel is sometimes
used by government officials. The ministries of Telecommunications
and Information are nearby, though neither suffered damage aside from
broken windows.</TE>
<TE>   "No one was expecting this. We hope this will be the last bomb,
but how can we say?" said Spinzar Hotel owner Abdullah Paiwand, as he
walked down the steps at the hotel entrance, which were covered in
glass shards and bloodstains.</TE>
<TE>   Death Toll Unknown</TE>
<TE>   The death toll remained unclear Thursday. Kabul's police chief put
the number of dead at 24, while Afghan national radio said as many as
26 people were killed.</TE>
<TE>   Kabul Radio said police had made two arrests but acknowledged that
they were not sure the suspects were involved in the explosions.
Authorities immediately focused suspicion on Al Qaeda forces.</TE>
<TE>   "It's the same people who had Afghanistan in misery for five
years, and they are taking the opportunity to spread terror," said
Gen. Abdul Mohammed Sherafi, who heads the precinct in which the
bombing took place. He said the bombs may have been detonated by
remote control.</TE>
<TE>   In any case, this war-ravaged country struggling to maintain
stability and begin reconstruction braced for further violence.
Several small bombs had gone off in and around Kabul in recent weeks
but caused few injuries and little damage.</TE>
<TE>   But the explosions Thursday, plus the recent flare-up of violence
between clashing warlords, were stark reminders that Afghanistan is
still a dangerous place, despite the presence of about 17,000
U.S.-led multinational troops still chasing down Al Qaeda and about
4,700 peacekeepers patrolling Kabul.</TE>
<TE>   Abdullah, the Afghan foreign minister, told reporters that the
bombs and the assassination attempt represented last-gasp attempts by
defeated opponents to oust the new regime.</TE>
<TE>   "We should continue our struggle in these last moments of
terrorism. We are faced with an evil and cruel enemy, and our people
have endured a lot of suffering over the years," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Other officials have admitted in recent weeks that an upsurge of
violence was possible, given the approaching first anniversaries of
the Sept. 11 attacks and the Sept. 9 killing of Ahmed Shah Masoud, an
anti-Taliban general allegedly murdered by Al Qaeda operatives.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. special envoy to Afghanistan Zalmay Khalilzad said these
developments indicate the "continuing challenge we face in
Afghanistan."</TE>

<DL>LOS CABOS, Mexico</DL>
<LD>Finance ministers from the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum,
or APEC, met Thursday to draft an agreement aimed at combating the
financing of Al Qaeda and other terrorist groups.</LD>
<LD>   Security guards set up roadblocks at the entrance to the hotel at
this beach resort at the tip of Mexico's Baja California peninsula
where the finance ministers from the 21-member group gathered behind
closed doors.</LD>
<LD>   The U.S. believes that Osama bin Laden's Al Qaeda terrorist
network engineered the Sept. 11 attacks, and it has moved to cut the
group's funding sources.</LD>
<TE>   After the attacks, the United States and other nations blocked
more than $112 million in assets Washington said were tied to funding
terrorism worldwide. But U.S. Treasury officials say a more global
effort is needed.</TE>
<TE>   The APEC Financiers' Group, a consultative body of banking
executives from APEC countries, recommended the sharing of lists of
people and companies identified as money launderers and financiers of
terrorist campaigns.</TE>

<HD>Arab League Stands United Against the Threat of a U.S.
Attack on Iraq</HD>
<DH>Mideast: Even U.S. allies toe the party line amid regional
tension over the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and talk of ousting
Saddam Hussein.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MICHAEL SLACKMAN and JAILAN ZAYAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>CAIRO</DL>
<LD>After months of expressing their individual opposition to a U.S.
attack on Iraq, Arab leaders offered a united front Thursday,
declaring their "total rejection of the threat of aggression on Arab
nations, especially Iraq."</LD>
<LD>   The statement was issued at the end of a two-day meeting of the
Arab League, the 22-member interest group that has often found it
extraordinarily difficult to join forces behind a single agenda.</LD>
<LD>   But propelled by anger over the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, Arab
leaders have forcefully notified the White House of the region's
profound opposition to an attack. The only nod to U.S. demands was a
renewed call on Iraq to allow the return of United Nations weapons
inspectors to the country.</LD>
<TE>   "If this war takes place, we see it against a backdrop of terror
and anger in the Middle East," said Amr Moussa, the league's
secretary-general. "People are angry and frustrated and cannot accept
what is happening in the occupied territories.</TE>
<TE>   "We will continue to work to avoid a military confrontation or a
military action," he said, "because we believe that it will open the
gates of hell in the Middle East."</TE>
<TE>   Although U.S. allies such as Kuwait and Jordan have said they
wouldn't object to a regime change in Baghdad, the social climate in
the Arab world is so agitated, no leader is willing to express
anything but total outrage at American intentions toward Iraqi
President Saddam Hussein.</TE>
<TE>   That has created an environment in which Washington says Hussein
must be eliminated because he is a threat to his neighbors, even as
all of those neighbors have joined together, at least publicly, to
declare their opposition.</TE>
<TE>   "If the United States invades Iraq, it will cause deep
anti-American feeling and will provoke revenge and violence in Arab
and Islamic countries," Youssef ibn Alawi, Oman's minister of state
for foreign affairs, said this week at a meeting of the six-nation
Gulf Cooperation Council in Jidda, Saudi Arabia.</TE>
<TE>   "The world cannot accept a weakened role for the United Nations,"
said Alawi, whose country plays host to a U.S. air base and arms
depot. "Those who are thinking they can impose a new law for their
own benefit, they are pushing the world into instability and chaos."</TE>
<TE>   It is difficult to determine whether this tough talk means that
the United States will be barred from using key military
installations throughout the region.</TE>
<TE>   The tiny emirate of Qatar, for example, with two important bases
and a high-tech command center, has dodged the question, saying it
has not yet received a formal request from the United States. But
there is tremendous Arab peer pressure mounting on the countries that
are strategically important to the United States, and so far they
have stuck with the party line.</TE>
<TE>   "We cannot imagine that any government will be part of any
military action against any Arab state," Moussa said Thursday at the
end of the Arab League meeting. "We all feel the danger."</TE>
<TE>   Bahrain, which plays host to the U.S. Navy's 5th Fleet, expressed
a similar sentiment.</TE>
<TE>   "We, the Arabs, must voice a clear stance against any new war in
the region," Bahrain's prime minister, Sheik Khalifa ibn Salman
Khalifa, said this week. "A new war will certainly be disastrous
economically, politically and socially not only for our brothers in
Iraq, but for the whole region and all the Arab states as well."</TE>
<TE>   The meeting of Arab League foreign ministers was a regularly
scheduled gathering. League officials pointed to the 100% turnout as
proof of the deep conviction that the region must unite behind Iraq.
Regularly scheduled meetings generally attract about half as many
participants.</TE>
<TE>   Iraqi Foreign Minister Naji Sabri, who flew in from Russia to
attend the meeting, was the star attraction and used the opportunity
to repeat his message of solidarity with the Arab community and
condemnation of the United States.</TE>
<TE>   "The Arab states have demonstrated their rejection to any threat
against Iraq," he said in brief comments to reporters. "This decision
shows Arab awareness of the sick minds of the U.S. administration."</TE>
<TE>   During the talks, Arab leaders also called for an end to U.N.
sanctions against Iraq and tried to persuade Sabri to take their case
for readmitting weapons inspectors back to Baghdad.</TE>
<TE>   The United Nations imposed strict sanctions against Iraq after it
invaded Kuwait in 1990. The sanctions are to be lifted only when
inspectors determine that Iraq has eliminated all of its weapons of
mass destruction and its ability to create such weapons. Inspectors
were pulled out before a U.S.-led strike against Iraq in 1998 and
have not been allowed back in.</TE>
<TE>   The Arab leaders also used the opportunity Thursday to restate
their case for viewing the Iraq conflict in the context of the fight
between Israelis and Palestinians. Still, the Palestinian issue did,
at least for this meeting, take a back seat to the urgency expressed
over a possible invasion of Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   "An attack on Iraq," said Nabil Shaath, the Palestinian minister
of planning and international cooperation, "is an attack on the whole
Arab world."</TE>

<LD>Mexico's Supreme Court has limited the autonomy that public
universities here enjoy by law, ruling that they must submit to
audits of how they use government funds.</LD>
<LD>   A university claimed that its autonomy--the legal status by which
police, government officials and troops need special permission to
enter campuses--also exempted it from Congress' attempts to
investigate the funds.</LD>
<LD>   But a five-member court panel ruled unanimously that "autonomy can
never be interpreted as the creation of fiefdoms ... beyond the
fundamental rules of the state."</LD>

<HD>Search for the Past Lies Buried by the Present</HD>
<DH>Archeology: Violence in the Mideast has deterred foreign
volunteers from visiting this summer, leaving key excavation sites to
languish.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HENRY CHU</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>HAZOR, Israel</DL>
<LD>Amnon Ben-Tor's job is to uncover the past, to bring to light the
secrets of lost civilizations buried under earth and stone.</LD>
<LD>   For 13 years, the noted archeologist has toiled in this corner of
northern Israel, looking for traces of the Canaanites who settled
here 5,000 years ago. Gazing out over his excavation site, Ben-Tor
can see the evidence he has unearthed so far: ruins of a mud-brick
palace mentioned in the Bible; a 2,800-year-old, still-functioning
olive-oil press.</LD>
<LD>   What Ben-Tor can't see, however, is the legion of foreign students
he relies on to help him dig each summer. They're not here. The
violence gripping Israel and the Palestinian territories scared most
of them away, forcing Ben-Tor to drastically scale back his
operations.</LD>
<TE>   The story is the same at dozens of other digs throughout the
region, many of which are dependent on the labor of eager volunteers
from abroad. As a result, excavations languish, artifacts lie
undiscovered, and archeologists are left to lament the involuntary
lull.</TE>
<TE>   "The situation [is] the worst I can recall in 30 years of
archeology," said Israel Finkelstein, the director of the Institute
of Archeology at Tel Aviv University. "And the future is a big
question mark."</TE>
<TE>   Besides being one of the world's most contested patches of land,
this area is among the most fertile for students of ancient
civilizations. The lure of biblical archeology has proven
irresistible to experts and amateurs for more than a century.</TE>
<TE>   But the bloody intifada that has raged for two years has brought
such research to a screeching halt. Not just human lives but
information is being lost, archeologists say, because hardly anyone
is around to help gather, document and analyze it. "The whole
situation is very depressing," Finkelstein said, "and one small
component of it is archeology."</TE>
<TE>   This year, not one of 24 U.S.-sponsored expeditions that have been
coming to Israel for years showed up. Volunteers, mostly
undergraduate and graduate students, withdrew their applications, and
universities from Massachusetts to Michigan to Maryland canceled
their digs out of safety and liability concerns.</TE>
<TE>   Unpaid volunteers, attracted by the promise of school credit and
the mystique of the Holy Land, have been the mainstay of archeology
in the region since the 1960s.</TE>
<TE>   "They're intelligent, they learn quickly, they're eager. They make
good workers and very good excavators," said Seymour Gitin, head of
the W.F. Albright Institute of Archeological Research in Jerusalem,
which has assisted U.S. expeditions in the region since 1900.
"They're a really good source of talent."</TE>
<TE>   The students not only help carry out the digs but help fund them.
A volunteer typically pays between $1,500 and $2,500 to join an
excavation for six to eight weeks.</TE>
<TE>   The number of students who apply every year is normally in the
hundreds. But with each report of a suicide bombing in Israel, and
then of military retaliation in the West Bank, the pool of applicants
shrank in the past year, until eventually it almost completely dried
up.</TE>
<TE>   Ben-Tor, a gruff, no-nonsense professor who teaches at Hebrew
University, said he had to fight for every volunteer. "I said if I
only have 10 people, I'm going out to dig."</TE>
<TE>   Ben-Tor was luckier than most: He was still able to persuade about
25 foreigners to join him and his Israeli students at Hazor, a lush,
hilly area near the Sea of Galilee and the Golan Heights.</TE>
<TE>   But with 60 people total, Ben-Tor's team was half its normal
strength, and some sections of the excavation went untouched.</TE>
<TE>   The site is enormous--about 200 acres--and only a fraction has
been explored. Even that fraction has produced some marvelous finds,
including stone tablets, ivory, jewelry, an exquisite foot-high
bronze statuette and the bust of an Egyptian aristocrat nearly 4,000
years old.</TE>
<TE>   While parts of the site can wait for future seasons, the Canaanite
royal palace can't, because once exposed, the fragile mud brick
starts decaying. The building is described in the Bible, in the book
of Joshua, as having been destroyed by a huge fire. Burn marks in the
brick support that account.</TE>
<TE>   Fewer workers mean fewer hands to uncover what remains and to
preserve what's already been found. Tarps thrown over the palace to
slow decay are "just first aid," Ben-Tor said.</TE>
<TE>   To his frustration, one Swedish and two American universities
backed out from sending volunteers to Hazor this year. Another
American university, which he declined to identify, was supposed to
inaugurate a long-term commitment to the dig this summer but pulled
out two months before the summer dig season began.</TE>
<TE>   "I told everybody: 'Listen, we don't care any less about our
students than you do about your students. If it's OK for us to be
here, it's OK for them,' " Ben-Tor said.</TE>
<TE>   But faced with high insurance premiums, U.S. institutions chose to
cancel their expeditions. Harvard refused to go back to its
excavation at the seaport of Ashkelon. USC, Penn State and Vanderbilt
all called off their participation this summer at Megiddo, an
important Iron Age site at the center of a debate on biblical
history.</TE>
<TE>   On June 5, a suicide bomber boarded a bus and blew himself up in
Megiddo, killing 17 others.</TE>
<TE>   "We're not going to force anybody," said Finkelstein of Tel Aviv
University, which heads the Megiddo dig. "I wouldn't want anyone to
force me to go to a war zone."</TE>
<TE>   Scholars stress that the dig sites themselves are extremely safe.
Many are located out on kibbutzim or in the countryside, away from
the public areas that have been targeted by suicide bombers for
maximum impact.</TE>
<TE>   Young people, however, are young people, and don't want to stay
confined. "We cannot jail them there. On the weekends, they go to
Jerusalem; they get on a bus to go to Tiberias," Finkelstein said.
"As long as they are with us at the camp, there's no problem, but the
moment they go out and they travel, then they're in danger."</TE>
<TE>   Bryan Kovach of New Jersey had some explaining to do when he told
his family that he would go ahead with his plans to come to Hazor. "I
had been counseled by relatives and friends, 'Do not go, do not
go'--the whole 'you're too young to die' thing," said Kovach, 28, who
is thinking of getting a PhD in biblical archeology. "I always said
the same thing: 'I'll take it into consideration.' "</TE>
<TE>   Having been to Hazor twice before, Kovach knew it was in a part of
northern Israel that had seen little violence. A major Israeli
military base sits a few miles away, in the town of Safed.</TE>
<TE>   "Northern Galilee is very quiet and peaceful," said Elizabeth
Crawford, 26, of Marion, Ind. "At home, the picture's painted that
tanks are rolling into every town, but when you get here, you know
that's not the case.</TE>
<TE>   "I feel really safe," she declared in a recent interview, as the
dig prepared to wrap up.</TE>
<TE>   Less than a week after she spoke, on Aug. 4, a suicide bomber blew
up a bus outside Safed, killing nine passengers and injuring about 50
other people.</TE>
<TE>   Fortunately, no one from the Hazor excavation was on the bus. "We
were very, very lucky," Ben-Tor said.</TE>

<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>ATHENS</DL>
<LD>A man known as "Poison Hand," the suspected top assassin of Greece's
November 17 urban guerrilla group, turned himself in to police
Thursday after weeks on the run.</LD>
<LD>   The surrender of Dimitris Koufodinas, 45, Greece's most wanted
man, marked the capture of the last major suspect sought in breaking
up the radical leftist band that since 1975 has killed 23 people,
including British, American and Turkish diplomats.</LD>
<LD>   The semiofficial Athens News Agency said Koufodinas was indirectly
in touch with police for several days before he turned himself in.
Police said some people indirectly connected to November 17 may still
be at large, but Koufodinas' detention marked the breakup of the
group's hard-core followers.</LD>
<TE>   Koufodinas, an amateur beekeeper known as "Poison Hand" because of
his deadly accuracy with a gun, has been described by November 17
suspects as their "hit man organizer."</TE>
<TE>   They said he and others he selected from the group carried out
killings; he also helped to plan shootings, bombings and robberies.</TE>
<TE>   Another November 17 suspect already in custody has said Koufodinas
helped him kill British defense attache Brig. Stephen Saunders in
downtown Athens in June 2000. Saunders' slaying was the last killing
blamed on the group.</TE>
<TE>   Since June, police have arrested and charged 15 suspected members
of November 17.</TE>

<HD>Afghanistan Fault Lines Are Showing</HD>
<DH>Stability: Karzai's government is still on shaky ground
despite progress in rebuilding.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN DANISZEWSKI and CHRIS KRAUL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>KABUL, Afghanistan</DL>
<LD>The attempted assassination of President Hamid Karzai in Kandahar and
a devastating car bombing in Kabul on Thursday constitute the
clearest threat yet to Karzai's transitional government, which took
office in June with strong U.S. backing.</LD>
<LD>   Although no evidence was immediately released tying the events
together, the attacks appeared to be coordinated and they were seen
here as a declaration by remnants of Al Qaeda and the Taliban that
Afghanistan's slow progress would not continue without a fight.</LD>
<LD>   Even though U.S. forces are providing security for Karzai, and
killed his assailant, perhaps the most enduring result of the attacks
Thursday will be to raise the question of whether the international
community in general, and the U.S. specifically, is doing enough to
ensure the success of Karzai's government. The role of U.S. troops,
who may have saved the life of a key politician working to build a
unified and moderate Afghanistan, underscores how difficult it will
be for the United States to withdraw any time soon.</LD>
<TE>   In addition to snuffing out lives and damaging property, the
attacks will also hurt Afghanistan's effort to attract much-needed
foreign investment. Government officials have said recently that
companies seemed to be sitting on their hands, waiting until after
Sept. 11 to make any business deals.</TE>
<TE>   The Afghan government said it had been bracing for some kind of
assault in connection with the first anniversary of the Sept. 11
attacks on the United States and the Sept. 9 assassination of
anti-Taliban warrior Ahmed Shah Masoud. But Thursday's twin attacks
still shocked people, mainly because things had been going relatively
smoothly.</TE>
<TE>   In the nine months since the Taliban regime was routed from its
last bastion in the southern city of Kandahar, a complex effort by
the United States, its allies and the new Afghan government seemed to
be bringing stability to the country.</TE>
<TE>   For the first time since a Communist coup in the mid-1970s, a
government has been selected by all the communities of Afghanistan in
a broadly democratic forum.</TE>
<TE>   There have been some attacks on U.S. forces in eastern
Afghanistan, where the hunt for remnants of the Al Qaeda terrorist
network continues near the Pakistani border, and there have been
occasional, mostly harmless explosions in the capital. But overall,
the country had settled into a period of calm.</TE>
<TE>   Instead of gunfire and explosions, the typical sound of a day in
Afghanistan had become the bustle of people going to jobs, the
grinding gears of old jalopies bringing home refugees from Pakistan
and Iran, and the sounds of construction as humanitarian workers and
the United Nations repaired schools, electrical systems and other
important services.</TE>
<TE>   Afghanistan had faded somewhat on the international radar screen,
replaced by the debate about whether the United States should move
against Iraq. But the attacks Thursday stand as a reminder that the
work of rebuilding Afghanistan and making it safe from the threat of
terrorism is far from over.</TE>
<TE>   One obvious question in recent weeks was whether the nearly
5,000-member international security force in Kabul should be expanded
to cover other parts of the country, where central authority still is
weak and warlords and criminals make life difficult for ordinary
people.</TE>
<TE>   The Bush administration has been lukewarm about expanding the
peacekeepers' role. Washington has said that it would not provide
U.S. troops for an expanded force and that a better approach would be
to train a new, non-factional Afghan army to provide security
throughout the country.</TE>
<TE>   But U.N. officials have warned that creation of a national army is
taking too long and that continued lawlessness in some provinces is
discouraging ordinary Afghans from backing their new government.</TE>
<TE>   There have been indications lately that the U.S. was softening its
opposition to expanding the area where the International Security
Assistance Force operates, but no firm decisions have been made.</TE>
<TE>   Another question has been how quickly the United States and other
big donors in Europe and Japan will deliver on pledges of $1.8
billion in aid for this year to get Afghanistan back on its feet.
Only about $800 million has so far been received, and Karzai's
government has been warning that it will lose the trust of its people
unless they see some big government projects that provide jobs, such
as the rebuilding of major national highways.</TE>
<TE>   Karzai travels to New York next week for the U.N. General Assembly
meeting, Sept. 11 ceremonies at the former site of the World Trade
Center and a meeting with President Bush. He is likely to press Bush
to agree to expand the international force and speed up aid
deliveries.</TE>
<TE>   Although the car bombing in Kabul exacted an awful toll, the
attack on Karzai was arguably more disturbing for U.S. policy. It is
hard to imagine how the new government could recover from an
assassination of Karzai, a man who carries the world's hopes for a
reborn Afghanistan. There is no political figure who approaches
Karzai in the ability to unify the country and its various ethnic
groups under a banner of moderation and inclusion.</TE>
<TE>   The attack Thursday was Karzai's second brush with death since he
took up the fight to oust the Taliban from his homeland. He almost
died during a battle near Kandahar last December when a U.S.
airstrike was called in too close to his position. The bombing took
place on the same day that Karzai was first nominated to lead what
was then the country's interim administration.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. forces assumed responsibility for Karzai's personal security
shortly after the assassination of Vice President Haji Abdul Qadir in
July. That now seems to have been a prescient decision, one that
might have saved the Afghan president's life.</TE>
<TE>   There is one other bright spot for U.S. interests in Afghanistan
after Thursday's attacks: the genuine disgust expressed by ordinary
Afghans over the car bombing and their frank appreciation of
international support.</TE>
<TE>   Mohammed Reza, a 33-year-old government employee who witnessed the
carnage, said, "Protecting Afghanistan is 50% the job of our forces
and 50% the job of the Americans. Their presence here is valuable and
worthy for us. If there was no need, why else would they be here?"</TE>

<HD>Israel Attacks Suspected Bomb Factory After a Blast Is
Averted</HD>
<DH>Mideast: Device discovered in vehicle could have leveled a
big building, officials say.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>JERUSALEM</DL>
<LD>Israeli helicopters attacked a suspected bomb factory in the Gaza
Strip early today, hours after Palestinian fighters blew up an
Israeli tank, killed two soldiers and tried to plant a huge car bomb
in Israel.</LD>
<LD>   The Palestinians launched their assaults Thursday despite
heightened Israeli security before the Jewish New Year that begins
tonight, saying the attacks were retaliation for Israel's killings of
Palestinian civilians.</LD>
<LD>   Israel hit back with a helicopter missile strike that left a metal
workshop in flames in Khan Yunis, a city in the western Gaza Strip,
witnesses said. Hospital officials said there were no casualties. The
Israeli military said the target was a weapons factory.</LD>
<TE>   Israeli Defense Minister Binyamin Ben-Eliezer told a meeting of
his Labor Party that Israel would not return occupied areas of the
strip to Palestinian Authority control, as agreed last month, his
spokesman said.</TE>
<TE>   Israelis were shaken by the magnitude of the attempted car bomb
attack that was prevented early Thursday when volunteers helping
police spotted two vehicles racing along a dirt road near the West
Bank, just inside Israel.</TE>
<TE>   After a brief pursuit, the drivers abandoned the vehicles and
escaped, and police found a bomb with 1,300 pounds of explosives in
one of them, a small truck. A huge cloud of orange flames and smoke
filled the sky as a bomb squad blew up the truck in an open field.</TE>
<TE>   A bomb that size, far larger than any that has exploded in Israel
during the two-year-old conflict, could have brought down a large
building, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   The attack on the tank in Gaza was a two-stage operation that
began with a nighttime rocket assault, drawing Israeli forces into
the area, the military said.</TE>
<TE>   A tank that went with other forces to search the area ran over and
detonated a huge bomb, blowing the turret off, killing the driver
instantly and trapping two soldiers under the three-ton turret, said
the unit commander. It took five hours to extricate the two from the
burning tank.</TE>
<TE>   About the same time, a Palestinian gunman approached a road used
by Israeli soldiers in the northern part of the Gaza Strip and opened
fire on a jeep, killing an officer and wounding a soldier. The
military said it chased the gunman and shot him dead.</TE>
<TE>   In Tel Aviv, Marwan Barghouti, a key leader of Yasser Arafat's
Fatah movement, officially went on trial on charges of murder,
attempted murder and terrorism and became the highest-ranking
Palestinian official to face an Israeli civil court.</TE>
<TE>   He wore a brown prison uniform and represented himself to
underline his rejection of the right of the Israeli court to try him.
"The one who should be sitting here [as a defendant] is the
government of Israel," Barghouti told the three-judge panel in fluent
Hebrew, learned in previous spells in Israeli prisons.</TE>
<TE>   Israel accuses Barghouti of orchestrating terror attacks that
killed 26 Israelis, ranging in age from 8 months to 79 years.</TE>

<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Allied aircraft bombed a military facility southwest of Baghdad on
Thursday after Iraqi forces attacked one of their patrols in the
"no-fly" zone, defense officials said.</LD>
<LD>   It was the 35th airstrike reported this year by the U.S. and
British coalition put together in 1991 to patrol zones in the north
and south of Iraq.</LD>
<LD>   In Thursday's strike, coalition aircraft used precision-guided
weapons to hit an air defense command-and-control facility at a
military airfield 240 miles from Baghdad, the U.S. Central Command
said.</LD>
<TE>   The strikes come as the Bush administration steps up efforts to
persuade the world of the need to overthrow Hussein and as Iraq wages
a campaign to rally the world against such a move. But attacks and
counterattacks in the no-fly zones have been going on for several
years. The numbers ebb and flow, and the Pentagon says there is no
particular increase now.</TE>

<DH>Africa: U.S. secretary of State visits for an update on a
cease-fire. He also touts efforts to rebuild.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>LUANDA, Angola</DL>
<LD>Drawing upon the post-Civil War words of Abraham Lincoln, Secretary
of State Colin L. Powell on Thursday urged Angola to maintain a
cease-fire and make better use of its oil wealth so it can rebuild.</LD>
<LD>   Powell visited the capital for an update on the April accord that
ended 27 years of war. He met with President Jose Eduardo dos Santos
at the presidential palace and then went to a United Nations joint
commission of government ministers and former rebel fighters from
UNITA, the Portuguese acronym for National Union for the Total
Independence of Angola.</LD>
<LD>   "Reconciliation will not be easy, but it must begin now," Powell
told the group. "The people of Angola have suffered enough."</LD>
<TE>   "President Lincoln did not discriminate between victors and
vanquished; he just saw hurting people who needed to be healed,"
Powell said. "This joint commission is not just about ending the war
... [it] must be a tool to build a new Angola."</TE>
<TE>   In Powell's meeting with Dos Santos, a senior Bush administration
official said, the secretary made clear that the U.S. would provide
short-term humanitarian assistance but that any long-term help would
be only in the form of technical assistance so the country can manage
its resources.</TE>
<TE>   He urged Dos Santos to use oil revenue to assist displaced
citizens and help former rebels return to society.</TE>

<HD>Ex-Khmer Rouge Leader Gets Life in Prison</HD>
<DH>Cambodia: Appeals court reverses acquittal in the murders
of three Western backpackers.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>PHNOM PENH, Cambodia</DL>
<LD>A court today sentenced a former senior Khmer Rouge leader, Col.
Chhouk Rin, to life in prison for the 1994 murders of three Western
backpackers, reversing an earlier acquittal.</LD>
<LD>   Chhouk Rin was acquitted two years ago by a municipal court of
charges that he and other Khmer Rouge members kidnapped and murdered
Briton Mark Slater, Frenchman Jean-Michel Braquet and Australian
David Wilson after ambushing the train on which the three were
traveling.</LD>
<LD>   "Since Chhouk Rin was the commander who sent his troops to
participate in the train attack," he was responsible for the murders,
said Samreth Sophal, the Appeals Court chief judge.</LD>
<TE>   He said that the municipal court's decision "has to be rejected"
and that there is "enough guilt to convict him of murder."</TE>
<TE>   The appeal was filed by Jean-Claude Braquet, father of the French
victim.</TE>
<TE>   Chhouk Rin and his lawyers did not attend the hearing, but chief
defense lawyer Put Theavy said he will appeal to the Supreme Court,
the last legal avenue.</TE>
<TE>   On Wednesday, the Supreme Court upheld a life sentence handed down
to a second Khmer Rouge leader, Nuon Paet, in 1999 for his role in
the killings.</TE>
<TE>   The court said the crimes committed under his command were
"vicious and barbaric."</TE>
<TE>   A third former Khmer Rouge leader, Sam Bith, who was implicated by
Nuon Paet, was arrested in May and is detained pending trial.
Authorities initially balked at arresting Sam Bith because he had
defected to the government's side. Human rights advocates have viewed
these trials as a barometer of the government's commitment to
pursuing justice for greater crimes that the Khmer Rouge committed
under its deadly 1975-79 rule. Starvation, disease, overwork and
executions claimed 1.7 million lives.</TE>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>TAIPEI, Taiwan</DL>
<LD>Typhoon Sinlaku battered Japan's southern islands Thursday, leaving a
tugboat and crew missing, and then churned on toward Taiwan.
Thousands of homes in Japan were without electricity, and many
schools were closed.</LD>
<LD>   The powerful storm's center was expected to pass just north of
Taiwan today, but Sinlaku's outer winds could lash the crowded
island, prone to deadly flash floods and mudslides, the Central
Weather Bureau said.</LD>
<LD>   Sinlaku, with winds of 90 mph, swept over the Ryukyu Islands
Wednesday and Thursday, injuring 29 people and cutting power to
89,200 homes, said Keiko Okumura, a spokeswoman for Okinawa
prefecture.</LD>
<TE>   Among the injured were people caught in collapsing houses, she
said.</TE>
<TE>   The storm closed the prefecture's public schools, Okumura said.</TE>

<HD>Large Fires Nearby Cast Smoky Pall Over Moscow</HD>
<DH>Russia: A drought and drained peat bogs are providing
conditions for blazes. Flawed land management gets the blame for
extensive underground burning.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CAROL J. WILLIAMS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SHATURA, Russia</DL>
<LD>After a rainless summer and decades of misguided drainage work in
this once-swampy countryside, fires have engulfed countless square
miles of desiccated peat bog and cast a suffocating pall over nearby
Moscow.</LD>
<LD>   Smoke from the slow-burning peat was so thick Thursday in the
capital, 75 miles west of here, that its most revered landmarks were
shrouded and drivers had to use headlights at noon.</LD>
<LD>   For hundreds of miles in every direction, the air was so dense
with carbon monoxide that health officials advised children and those
with respiratory ailments to remain indoors. Planes were diverted
Thursday morning from all three major Moscow airports, and flights
were hours late once traffic resumed.</LD>
<TE>   From the mansions in elite summer playgrounds outside the capital
such as Peredelkino to the meager wooden shacks of poor pensioners in
this down-at-the-heels industrial town, Russians were suffering the
ecological consequences of unbridled land reclamation launched more
than 70 years ago.</TE>
<TE>   Once a restful retreat of lakes and swamps popular with duck
hunters, the Shatura region was drained by Soviet authorities, drying
the rich, loamy bogs to harvest cheap fuel for an electrical power
plant. Fires have regularly ravaged the peat left high and dry by the
drainage, but this year has seen less rain and more fires than in the
past 30 years.</TE>
<TE>   "Peat burns as deep as 7 meters [23 feet], and the fires can
spread underground to emerge somewhere 100 meters [about 330 feet]
away, which is why it is so hard to extinguish," said Oleg G.
Kolesnikov, deputy head of government for the Shatura district, where
72,000 people live.</TE>
<TE>   Like others overseeing the emergency response that has hundreds of
firefighters and soldiers engaged in a Sisyphean task of tamping down
the ubiquitous menace, Kolesnikov acknowledged that Russians brought
upon themselves this endless summer of smoke by meddling with the
water table.</TE>
<TE>   Across Russia, almost 900 fires are burning, including 200 major
blazes that cash-strapped communities like this one have struggled to
contain. Nearly 4 million acres of forest have been burned this year,
one of the hottest and driest on record, the Ministry for Emergency
Situations reported earlier this week.</TE>
<TE>   Here in Shatura, the carbon monoxide level is so hazardous that
evacuations will have to be ordered if the toxicity limits are
exceeded for more than eight hours, said Viktor Solokhin, the
regional chief of sanitation and epidemiology. The level was nearly
three times the maximum allowable early Thursday and remained
critical for five hours.</TE>
<TE>   While midday breezes have alleviated the smoke in central Shatura
district most afternoons of this summer-long fire disaster, residents
in outlying areas were advised earlier this week to leave before the
unpredictable underground creep of incineration could catch them off
guard.</TE>
<TE>   Some, though, refuse to leave the woodland retreats they lovingly
built over the dried bogs.</TE>
<TE>   "I've lived my life so I don't care what happens to me, but I
can't leave my roses," said 79-year-old Anastasia Stepanova, who
showed a visitor how the lowered water table and oxygen-robbing smoke
have dried her cherished garden. A World War II partisan and survivor
of myriad Soviet perils, Stepanova said she fears nothing from a fire
that doesn't even flame much.</TE>
<TE>   Others, like neighbor Marina Kalinina, are far more scared--and
angry. Relocated 10 years ago from a lakeside garden plot closer to
Moscow to make way for an elite housing development, Kalinina rails
against corrupt officials she blames for her ill fortune.</TE>
<TE>   "This is what I get for 60 years of slaving! A pension of 1,500
rubles [about $50] a month and land that burns!" she howled, pouring
invective on the few firefighters languidly chopping back tree
branches between cigarette breaks. "Everyone was asleep when the
fires started, and they let them get out of control."</TE>
<TE>   Fifty firefighters have been dispatched here from Moscow to help
contain the biggest source of the smoke enveloping the capital, home
to 8.5 million people, and other areas of western Russia in a
500-mile stretch from St. Petersburg to Bryansk. But with no rain in
sight and winds shifting unpredictably, crews concede that they are
overwhelmed.</TE>
<TE>   Retired engineer Vladimir Nikitin, 67, was among those working to
keep the fire away from his hand-built cottage. He lamented the
decades of drainage that turned the land into tinder.</TE>
<TE>   "Years of stupidity and neglect brought us to this point where I
have to defend my dacha with an ax in my hand," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Shatura is a leading contributor to the choking clouds wafting
over western Russia, but other blazes are adding to the problem.
Wildfires in the grasslands north and west of Moscow have expanded in
recent days.</TE>
<TE>   Russia's inadequate environmental laws also contribute to the
problem. Despite the palpable air-quality hazard from the wildfires,
municipal workers in the Moscow suburb of Lyubertsy were burning
fallen leaves Thursday--true to a late-summer cleanup schedule
drafted long before the disaster.</TE>
<TE>   Flying water tankers have been deployed to fight the forest and
grassland fires, but aerial water drops are useless in combating peat
fires that burn below the surface. Sudden blasts of water can send
incendiary chunks flying to engulf new areas, said Kolesnikov, the
deputy head of government for the Shatura district.</TE>
<TE>   Locals accuse Moscow Mayor Yuri M. Luzhkov of having made their
plight worse by seeding the few rain clouds that wafted over the
region last weekend to prevent rainfall from dampening a citywide
celebration of Moscow's 855th birthday.</TE>
<TE>   "I can't judge for sure whether the planes deployed actually
dispersed any substances," Kolesnikov said with diplomatic evasion.
"But I can tell you with 100% certainty that none of those clouds
dropped any rain."</TE>

a 65-page plan that vows to attack nearly every ill on Earth.</LD>
<LD>   But the 10-day global gathering here, once hailed as a broad
effort to help preserve the planet, ended as a success more for its
promises than for its achievements, participants say.</LD>
<LD>   "Oh boy, is it ambitious!" said Jeffrey D. Sachs, director of the
Earth Institute at Columbia University and a special advisor to U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan. "If this were actually carried out, it
would be very good for the world. But there is no, absolutely no
evidence of a real strategy to accomplish these goals."</LD>
<TE>   Although public expectations of action are high, a fundamental
problem exists: The plan--which covers everything from rebuilding
fisheries, forests and protecting the diversity of species to
bringing water, energy and medicine to the poor--is nonbinding.</TE>
<TE>   To avoid continuing stagnation, the U.N. nudged participants at
the World Summit on Sustainable Development to form partnerships and
pick a project, large or small, that will begin to chip away at
environmental or development problems.</TE>
<TE>   Annan's burgeoning "era of partnerships," as he calls it,
flourished during the conference. Hundreds of governments, private
groups, businesses and foundations lined up to announce
"partnerships"--sometimes with old partners or even old adversaries.</TE>
<TE>   Environmental activists from Greenpeace and representatives of
British Petroleum, who once battled over an oil platform in the North
Atlantic, joined hands to push for binding government commitments to
stem global warming. Israel and Jordan pledged to work together to
breathe life into the Dead Sea, which is ebbing from a shortage of
water.</TE>
<TE>   A foundation of Shell Oil teamed up with the World Resources
Institute to curb vehicles with the dirtiest exhaust in the world's
biggest cities. "It caught our attention when Shell was giving us
money to drive off customers that use their product," said Jonathan
Lash, the institute's president.</TE>
<TE>   The United States rolled out a series of partnerships to protect
Congo's rain forest, to battle AIDS, and to bring clean water and
cleaner energy to impoverished and isolated regions of the world.</TE>
<TE>   Bush administration officials have been vague about financial
commitments to these projects and, in turn, been criticized by
environmental groups that accuse the U.S. of reshuffling dollars and
programs to look like something new.</TE>
<TE>   "The Bush administration has given these partnerships a bad name,"
said Jacob Scherr, director of international programs for the Natural
Resources Defense Council. "It's a shame, because these partnerships
are exciting. So many other countries have been inspired by this
meeting to participate with concrete actions that can make a
difference."</TE>
<TE>   International environmental and relief organizations piled on the
complaints about the Bush administration, both about its proposed
partnerships and the U.S. delegation's successful efforts to weaken
language in the summit's implementation plan.</TE>
<TE>   All of this culminated in the jeering of Secretary of State Colin
L. Powell during a speech Wednesday as he stood in for President
Bush, who declined to attend the summit that drew more than 100 heads
of state and government.</TE>
<TE>   "U.S. Wrecks Earth Summit," read a flier handed out by the
nonprofit environmental group Friends of the Earth. It criticized the
administration's resistance to provisions in the plan to hold
corporations more accountable for environmental consequences and the
U.S. delegation's successful efforts to scuttle a European proposal
to increase the world's reliance on nonpolluting solar and wind
energy to 15% of power needs by 2010.</TE>
<TE>   The plan now only urges a "substantial increase" in renewable
energy--a goal that cannot be measured. "Throughout this summit, the
U.S. administration has betrayed our environment and the needs of the
poor and the vulnerable," said Ricardo Navarro, chairman of Friends
of the Earth. "That's why we were protesting during Colin Powell's
shameless and inadequate speech."</TE>
<TE>   Sachs, the Columbia professor, noted that other administration
officials have been booed at AIDS conferences and other international
gatherings. "The fact that Colin got jeered shows that the U.S.
government doesn't understand these issues, and doesn't understand
that the rest of the world cares passionately about them," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Much of the hostility toward the United States has mounted since
the Bush administration's decision to back out of international
environmental efforts, such as the Kyoto Protocol, which sets targets
to cut emissions blamed for global warming. U.S. officials, along
with the Vatican and some conservative Islamic nations, fought to
keep women's health issues out of the summit's final document. One
issue absent from the implementation plan is population growth, even
though it lies at the heart of many sustainable development issues:
water scarcity, food security, deforestation and energy consumption.</TE>
<TE>   The document has one reference to "reproductive and sexual
health," but no mention of providing reproductive education or birth
control in the developing world. U.N. officials said the reason is
that neither the environmentalists nor government officials want to
engage the foes of abortion.</TE>
<TE>   The Bush administration prevailed in much of the negotiations over
wording of the implementation plan. As the world's richest
nation--and the one contributing the most in aid to foreign
countries--the U.S. successfully pushed for language requiring
governments that receive foreign aid to respect the rule of law and
also property rights and to prevent corruption.</TE>
<TE>   The plan was supposed to differ from its predecessor, an agenda
set out during the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro a decade ago. But
this document ended up closer to the Rio document than many
participants had hoped.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not really a plan of implementation," Sachs said. "It's
actually a very thorough set of exhortations, intentions, goals and
targets. The point is, the world readily signs on to bold objectives,
without any real sense of how they are going to be met."</TE>
<TE>   In addition to the implementation plan, the delegates from more
than 190 nations issued a declaration: "We commit ourselves to act
together, united by a common determination to save our planet,
promote human development and achieve universal prosperity and
peace."</TE>

<LD>U.S. forces in Afghanistan are holding a Canadian teenager on
suspicion of killing a U.S. soldier in a combat operation, Canadian
officials said Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   The Canadian Department of Foreign Affairs said Omar Khadr, who
will turn 16 on Sept. 19, should get special consideration because of
his age.</LD>
<LD>   Foreign Minister Bill Graham said Khadr, who was wounded during a
July 27 firefight with U.S. forces, was being held at Bagram air base
north of Kabul, the Afghan capital.</LD>
<TE>   According to Graham, Khadr allegedly killed a U.S. soldier, though
the statement by his department said that U.S. investigations into
the combat operation were ongoing and that no charges had been filed.</TE>
<TE>   It also was learned Thursday that Khadr's brother, Abdul Rahman,
19, had been detained in November by the Northern Alliance, which
ousted the Taliban regime with U.S. assistance. He is still being
held in Kabul.</TE>
<TE>   The pair's father, Ahmed Saeed Khadr, is a Canadian citizen
arrested in Pakistan in 1995 in connection with a bombing at the
Egyptian Embassy in Islamabad, the Pakistani capital. Fifteen people
died in the blast.</TE>
<TE>   Washington has linked the elder Khadr, who was freed shortly after
the embassy bombing, to Al Qaeda, the terrorist network run by Osama
bin Laden.</TE>

<LD>Delegates from more than 190 nations signed on to a blueprint to aid
the poor and protect Earth's environment. The 65-page Johannesburg
Implementation Plan sets forth an ambitious agenda. But the plan is
nonbinding, raising questions as to how, or if, these goals will be
met. Here are some prominent ones:</LD>
<LD>   Clean water</LD>
<LD>   Reduce by half the 1.1 billion people who lack clean drinking
water and basic sanitation by 2015. The promise is welcomed by
development charities as an important step toward preventing the 2
million deaths a year, mostly among children, from water-borne
illnesses such as cholera.</LD>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Health</TE>
<TE>   Ensure that drug-company patents do not prevent poor countries
from making medicines available to poor people; make antiviral drugs
available to all infected by HIV/AIDS; reduce incidence of HIV among
teenagers and young adults, ages 15 to 24, by 25% in the most
affected countries by 2005 and globally by 2010.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Toxic chemicals</TE>
<TE>   Phase out lead-based paints worldwide as well as lead in gasoline;
make sure all chemicals are produced and used in ways that do not
harm human health or the environment by 2020.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Oceans</TE>
<TE>   Cease destructive fishing practices and establish a network of
marine protected areas that are off limits to fishing by 2012;
eliminate subsidies that contribute to excessive and illegal fishing.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Global warming</TE>
<TE>   Reaffirms commitment to stabilize greenhouse gas emissions from
fossil fuels; governments that have ratified the Kyoto Protocol,
which sets up targets to reduce globe-warming gases, encourage others
to ratify the treaty.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Poverty</TE>
<TE>   Reduce by half the proportion of people who live in
poverty--defined as those whose income is less than $1 a day--and
suffer from hunger; make elementary schooling available to all
children by 2015; significantly improve the lives of at least 100
million slum dwellers by 2020 and establish a fund to wipe out
poverty.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Biodiversity</TE>
<TE>   Cut significantly the rate at which rare animals and plants are
becoming extinct by controlling invasive species and protecting
important habitat for species in forests, wetlands and coral reefs.</TE>

<HD>Sharp Questions on Iraq Await Bush in Congress</HD>
<DH>Military: President reaffirms his opposition to Hussein.
Debate could dominate legislative sessions and influence key
elections.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NICK ANDERSON and EDWIN CHEN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Faced with the growing likelihood of a major vote this fall on Iraq,
members of Congress on Thursday raised a host of pointed questions
they say President Bush must answer if he seeks their approval for
sending U.S. troops to topple Saddam Hussein.</LD>
<LD>   Bush, meanwhile, reiterated in strong terms that he is resolved to
move against the Iraqi president, even as the administration's
precise plan for doing so remains unclear.</LD>
<LD>   "I meant it when I said I'm going to consult with Congress," Bush
said at a political fund-raiser in Louisville, Ky., a day after
announcing that he would seek congressional approval before taking
any action.</LD>
<TE>   "One thing is for certain: I'm not going to change my view," he
added. "And my view is, we cannot let the world's worst leaders
blackmail America, threaten America or hurt America with the world's
worst weapons."</TE>
<TE>   The debate over Iraq could dominate the next few weeks of this
year's congressional session and, possibly, influence some critical
contests in the Nov. 5 midterm elections.</TE>
<TE>   On a number of fronts Thursday on Capitol Hill and on the
congressional campaign trail, there were signs of the intensifying
debate:</TE>
<TE>   A spokesman for the House International Relations Committee said
the panel would quiz Bush administration officials closely on Iraq in
classified briefings and public hearings starting in the middle of
this month.</TE>
<TE>   Eighteen liberal House Democrats and one independent sent Bush a
letter with sharp questions about a potential military strike against
Iraq, laying the groundwork for antiwar arguments should the
president decide on a full-fledged invasion.</TE>
<TE>   Several Senate candidates, Democrats and Republicans alike,
announced that they would support Bush or were leaning toward backing
a bid for congressional approval of action against Hussein. Some
Democrats, however, remained skeptical or noncommittal.</TE>
<TE>   Senators from both parties took to the floor to raise questions
that outlined the evolving debate and the growing chorus for more
details on the threat that the administration says Hussein poses.</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Robert C. Byrd (D-W.Va.) wondered when the administration
would demonstrate that Hussein has, or is close to having, nuclear
weapons. "Where is the evidence?" he asked. "We have a duty to ask
questions because we are living in a very perilous time, and the war
drums are beating all around us."</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) said a strike at Iraq could
complicate efforts to settle the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and set
back the U.S.'s declared war on Al Qaeda and other terrorist
networks. She added that launching a major invasion of another nation
"leads to the questions of whether a preemptive war is morally right,
legally right, or politically the right way for the United States to
proceed."</TE>
<TE>   Other senators who support the president, such as Democrat Zell
Miller of Georgia, said Bush must still convince the public. "I don't
think the president has made the case with the folks back home,"
Miller said. "He can, and I think he will, but he hasn't yet."</TE>
<TE>   Bush sought Thursday to build such support. With a fresh sense of
urgency, he declared in four animated speeches in Kentucky and South
Bend, Ind., his seemingly unalterable conviction that the United
States must force a regime change in Baghdad.</TE>
<TE>   Referring to weapons of mass destruction thought by the
administration to be in Hussein's possession, Bush said in
Louisville: "We must anticipate problems before they occur. We must
deal with threats to our security today-- before it can be too late."</TE>
<TE>   Aboard Air Force One, White House Press Secretary Ari Fleischer
told reporters: "The president believes that the evidence that we
have already seen to date is sufficient to require regime change."</TE>
<TE>   Bush is scheduled to continue pressing his case today in telephone
calls to the leaders of China, Russia and France. He also is to meet
Saturday at Camp David, the presidential retreat in Maryland, with
British Prime Minister Tony Blair, one of America's staunchest
allies. In addition, Bush plans to travel to Detroit on Monday to
meet with Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chretien.</TE>
<TE>   On Capitol Hill, the questions broached by lawmakers over Iraq
showed that the administration would face a formidable task in
assembling broad bipartisan support for a military strike, especially
if large numbers of U.S. troops are involved.</TE>
<TE>   While some Republicans are urging a go-slow approach, most of the
skeptics are Democrats. That was true in January 1991, when Bush's
father, then-President George Bush, won approval from a divided
Congress for a resolution authorizing the use of force against Iraq
in the Persian Gulf War. The partisan divide from 1991 lingers today
and could be a factor in the coming debate.</TE>
<TE>   Of the 75 Democrats still in the House who voted on the 1991 war
resolution, 52 opposed it. The ranks of the naysayers included such
current party leaders as Reps. Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri and
Nancy Pelosi of San Francisco.</TE>
<TE>   By contrast, of 67 House Republicans who remain from the vote
nearly a dozen years ago, only one voted against the resolution: Rep.
Constance A. Morella of Maryland.</TE>
<TE>   Much has changed since 1991. Most important, the nation is
fighting a war on terrorism after the Sept. 11 attacks. And there is
growing concern about the threat of biological, chemical or nuclear
attacks from terrorists, possibly aided by rogue states such as Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   Still, some of those who voted against the 1991 resolution seem
prepared to take a similar position now. Rep. Peter A. DeFazio
(D-Ore.), for instance, is deeply skeptical of the direction taken by
the current Bush administration toward Iraq. "To date, they have not
made a case that would persuade me," DeFazio said.</TE>
<TE>   He wrote a letter, signed by 18 other House liberals, demanding
explanations from Bush on Iraq's weapons capabilities and on the
military and diplomatic fallout of a U.S. strike against Baghdad.</TE>
<TE>   While the role of foreign policy in the congressional races
remains unclear, Bush's anti-Hussein campaign could affect some key
contests. The president's announcement that he would seek approval
before taking action raised pressure on candidates to clarify their
positions on military action.</TE>
<TE>   Tellingly, several Democrats running for the Senate in states that
Bush carried in 2000 quickly indicated that they would vote for a
resolution authorizing action against Iraq if they were in office.</TE>
<TE>   Rep. Bob Clement (D-Tenn), who's running for an open Senate seat
against Republican Lamar Alexander, said Wednesday that he would vote
with Bush. Alex Sanders, who's vying with Republican Rep. Lindsay O.
Graham for an open Senate seat in South Carolina, said through a
spokesman that "if the vote were today ... he would support the
president."</TE>
<TE>   Dan Pfeiffer, spokesman for Sen. Tim Johnson (D-S.D.), who is
seeking reelection, said the candidate "likely" would vote for a
resolution.</TE>
<TE>   Whit Ayres, a Republican pollster working on the South Carolina
and Tennessee Senate races, said Democrats in more hawkish states are
unlikely to oppose the president. But he said that a prolonged Iraq
debate will benefit GOP candidates by shifting the public's focus
away from the economy toward national security issues, a Republican
strength among most voters.</TE>
<TE>   Democrats dispute that notion. And some Democrats believe that the
congressional vote may offer their candidates in more conservative
states an unexpected opportunity to blunt Republican attacks on their
defense record.</TE>

<LD>The city's neon lights vibrated in the polished hood of the black BMW
as it cruised up Las Vegas Boulevard.</LD>
<LD>   The man in the passenger seat was instantly recognizable. Fans
lined the streets, waving, snapping photos, begging Tupac Shakur for
his autograph. Cops were everywhere, smiling.</LD>
<LD>   The BMW 750 sedan, with rap magnate Marion "Suge" Knight at the
wheel, was leading a procession of luxury vehicles past the MGM Grand
Hotel and Caesars Palace, on their way to a hot new nightclub. It was
after 11 on a Saturday night--Sept. 7, 1996. The caravan paused at a
crowded intersection a block from the Strip.</LD>
<TE>   Shakur flirted with a carful of women--unaware that a white
Cadillac had quietly pulled up beside him. A hand emerged from the
Cadillac. In it was a semiautomatic pistol, aimed straight at Shakur.</TE>
<TE>   Many of the rapper's lyrics seemed to foretell this moment.</TE>
<TE>   "The fast life ain't everything they told ya," he sang in an early
hit, "Soulja's Story."</TE>
<TE>   "Never get much older, following the tracks of a soulja."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Six years later, the killing of the world's most famous rap star
remains officially unsolved. Las Vegas police have never made an
arrest. Speculation and wild theories continue to flourish in the
music media and among Shakur's followers. One is that Knight, owner
of Shakur's record label, arranged the killing so he could exploit
the rapper's martyrdom commercially. Another persistent legend is
that Shakur faked his own death to escape the pressures of stardom.</TE>
<TE>   A yearlong investigation by The Times reconstructed the crime and
the events leading up to it. Evidence gathered by the paper
indicates:</TE>
<TE>   * The shooting was carried out by a Compton gang called the
Southside Crips to avenge the beating of one of its members by Shakur
a few hours earlier.</TE>
<TE>   * Orlando Anderson, the Crip whom Shakur had attacked, fired the
fatal shots. Las Vegas police discounted Anderson as a suspect and
interviewed him only once, briefly. He was later killed in an
unrelated gang shooting.</TE>
<TE>   * The murder weapon was supplied by New York rapper Notorious
B.I.G., who agreed to pay the Crips $1 million for killing Shakur.
Notorious B.I.G. and Shakur had been feuding for more than a year,
exchanging insults on recordings and at award shows and concerts.
B.I.G. was gunned down six months later in Los Angeles. That killing
also remains unsolved.</TE>
<TE>   Before they died, Notorious B.I.G. and Anderson denied any role in
Shakur's death. This account of what they and others did that night
is based on police affidavits and court documents as well as
interviews with investigators, witnesses to the crime and members of
the Southside Crips who had never before discussed the killing
outside the gang.</TE>
<TE>   Fearing retribution, they agreed to be interviewed only if their
names were not revealed.</TE>
<TE>   Revolutionary Upbringing</TE>
<TE>   The slaying silenced one of modern music's most eloquent voices--a
ghetto poet whose tales of urban alienation captivated young people
of all races and backgrounds. The 25-year-old Shakur had helped
elevate rap from a crude street fad to a complex art form, setting
the stage for the current global hip-hop phenomenon.</TE>
<TE>   Tupac Amaru Shakur was born in 1971 into a family of black
revolutionaries and named after a martyred Incan warrior. Radical
politics shaped his upbringing and the rebellious tone of much of his
music.</TE>
<TE>   His godfather, Black Panther leader Elmer "Geronimo" Pratt, spent
27 years in prison for a robbery-murder in Santa Monica that he
insisted he did not commit. Pratt was freed after a judge ruled in
1997 that prosecutors concealed evidence favorable to the defendant.</TE>
<TE>   Shakur's stepfather, Black Panther leader Mutulu Shakur, was on
the FBI's Ten Most Wanted list until the early 1980s, when he was
imprisoned for robbery and murder. His mother, Afeni Shakur, also a
Black Panther, was charged with conspiring to blow up a block of New
York department stores--and acquitted a month before the rapper was
born.</TE>
<TE>   Shakur grew up in tough neighborhoods and homeless shelters in the
Bronx, Harlem and Baltimore. He exhibited creative talent as a child
and was admitted to the Baltimore School for the Arts, where he
studied ballet, poetry, theater and literature.</TE>
<TE>   In 1988, his mother sent him to live with a family friend in the
Bay Area to escape gang violence in Baltimore. Living in a tough
neighborhood north of Oakland, he joined the rap group Digital
Underground and signed a solo record deal in 1991.</TE>
<TE>   Shakur's debut album, "2Pacalypse Now," sparked a political
firestorm. The lyrics were filled with vivid imagery of violence by
and against police. A car thief who murdered a Texas state trooper
said the lyrics incited him to kill. Law enforcement groups and
politicians denounced Shakur. Then-Vice President Dan Quayle said the
rapper's music "has no place in our society."</TE>
<TE>   Shakur's recordings explored gang violence, drug dealing, police
brutality, teenage pregnancy, single motherhood and racism. As his
stature as a rapper grew, he pursued an acting career, drawing
admiring reviews for his performances in "Juice" and other films.</TE>
<TE>   But he never put what he called the "thug life" behind him.</TE>
<TE>   During a 1993 concert in Michigan, he attacked a local rapper with
a baseball bat and was sentenced to 10 days in jail. In Los Angeles,
he was convicted of assaulting a music video producer. In New York, a
19-year-old fan accused Shakur and three of his friends of sexually
assaulting her.</TE>
<TE>   While on trial in that case, the rapper was ambushed in a
Manhattan recording studio, shot five times and robbed of his gold
jewelry. Shakur later said Notorious B.I.G. and his associates were
behind the attack.</TE>
<TE>   Shakur, convicted of sexual abuse, was serving a 4 1/2-year prison
term when he was visited by Suge Knight, founder of Death Row Records
in Los Angeles. Knight offered to finance an appeal of his conviction
if Shakur would sign a recording contract with Death Row.</TE>
<TE>   Shakur accepted the offer and was released from prison in 1995 on
a $1.4-million appellate bond posted by Knight. Hours later, Shakur
entered a Los Angeles studio to record "All Eyez on Me." The double
CD sold more than 5 million copies, transforming Shakur into a pop
superstar whose releases outsold Madonna's and the Rolling Stones'.</TE>
<TE>   Two Fights</TE>
<TE>   On Sept. 7, 1996, Shakur, still out on bond, traveled to Las Vegas
to attend a championship boxing match between Mike Tyson and Bruce
Seldon at the MGM Grand Hotel.</TE>
<TE>   The sold-out arena was jammed with high rollers: Wall Street
tycoons, Hollywood celebrities, entertainment moguls. The fight also
attracted an assortment of underworld figures: mobsters from Chicago,
drug dealers from New York, street gangs from Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Shakur arrived around 8:30 p.m. accompanied by armed bodyguards
from the Mob Piru Bloods, a Compton street gang whose members worked
for Knight's Death Row Records. Shakur and Knight sat in the front
row, smoking cigars, signing autographs and waving to fans.</TE>
<TE>   "Knock You Out," a song Shakur had written in honor of Tyson,
blasted over the loudspeakers as the boxer entered the ring. Tyson
flattened his opponent so quickly that many patrons never made it to
their seats.</TE>
<TE>   After congratulating Tyson, Shakur, Knight and a handful of
bodyguards in silk suits headed for the exit. In the MGM Grand lobby,
one of Shakur's Bloods bodyguards noticed a member of the rival
Southside Crips lingering near a bank of elevators.</TE>
<TE>   The Bloods and Crips have a 30-year history of turf wars:
beatings, drug heists, drive-by shootings. The Crips dress in blue,
the Bloods in red. When the two gangs aren't pushing dope or
terrorizing citizens, they take pride in retaliating against each
other.</TE>
<TE>   The hoodlum standing in the lobby was Orlando "Baby Lane"
Anderson, 21, a Crip who had recently helped his gang beat and rob
one of Shakur's bodyguards at a mall in Lakewood. Anderson had a
string of arrests for robbery, assault and other offenses. Compton
police suspected him in at least one gang killing.</TE>
<TE>   After the beating of Shakur's bodyguard, Anderson had dared to rip
a rare Death Row medallion from the man's neck--an affront to
Knight's honor and a slight to the Bloods.</TE>
<TE>   The Bloods had been fuming for weeks, waiting to exact their
revenge. Now, unexpectedly, there was Anderson, standing before them.</TE>
<TE>   Shakur charged the Crip. "You from the South?" he asked.</TE>
<TE>   Before Anderson could answer, Shakur punched him. His bodyguards
jumped in, pounding and kicking Anderson to the ground. Knight joined
in too--just before security guards broke up the 30-second melee,
which was captured by a security camera.</TE>
<TE>   Shakur and his entourage stomped triumphantly across the casino
floor on their way out of the hotel. They walked half a block down
the Strip to the Luxor hotel, where Death Row Records had booked more
than a dozen rooms. After dropping off Shakur and the bodyguards,
Knight drove about 15 minutes to a mansion he owned in a gated
community in the city's southeastern valley.</TE>
<TE>   The plan was to regroup later at a benefit concert for a youth
boxing program featuring Shakur and other Death Row acts. The
midnight concert was to be held at Club 662, a nightspot just opened
by Death Row. The club's name was an emblem of how gangs had
infiltrated the rap business. On a telephone keypad, 662 spells
"mob."</TE>
<TE>   Planning a Retaliation</TE>
<TE>   A bruised and shaken Anderson gathered himself off the floor in
front of dozens of startled onlookers. MGM security guards and Las
Vegas police tried to persuade him to file a complaint against his
assailants, but he declined.</TE>
<TE>   Anderson headed out to the Strip and crossed over a pedestrian
bridge to the Excalibur Hotel, where he had checked in with his
girlfriend. News of the beating swept through the gang underground.
Before he reached his room, Anderson's pager was beeping with calls
from his Crips cohorts, according to what he later told associates.</TE>
<TE>   Anderson phoned his comrades and set up a meeting at the Treasure
Island hotel. He changed his clothes and hopped into a taxi, heading
for the hotel with the huge neon skull and crossbones out front.</TE>
<TE>   Treasure Island had served as a Crips headquarters during boxing
matches for years. The gang would rent a fleet of luxury vehicles,
ride across the desert in a caravan, hand their keys to the valets
and head to a block of rooms booked under fake names. Drug
trafficking paid for all this.</TE>
<TE>   The ritual had little to do with boxing. Many gang members never
attended the fights. They came to party and bask in the post-fight
revelry: the drinking, the gambling, the drugs, the prostitutes.
Other street gangs followed suit, flying in from Harlem and Atlanta,
taking over establishments up and down the Strip.</TE>
<TE>   By the time Anderson's taxi reached Treasure Island, more than a
dozen gangsters were holed up in a Crips-reserved room. Marijuana
smoke clouded the hallway. Alcohol was flowing as Anderson opened the
door. The gang was furious. The topic of discussion: Who gets to pull
the trigger?</TE>
<TE>   According to people who were present, the Crips decided to shoot
Shakur after his performance at Club 662. The plan was to station two
vehicles of armed Crips outside the nightspot and lie in wait.</TE>
<TE>   The gang put in a call to a Crips hide-out in Las Vegas, a rented
house used to stash drugs and firearms and shelter gang members on
the run from crimes committed in Los Angeles. They told a man there
to bring some backup weapons over to the hotel. Soon.</TE>
<TE>   Killers for Hire</TE>
<TE>   For the Crips, the beating of Anderson was an egregious affront
warranting swift and fatal retaliation. Still, the Crips thought, why
not make a little money while they were at it? They decided to ask
Shakur's biggest enemy to pay for the hit.</TE>
<TE>   The gang arranged a rendezvous with Notorious B.I.G. The Brooklyn
rapper, whose real name was Christopher Wallace, hated Shakur and had
been feuding with him for more than a year.</TE>
<TE>   Once tight friends, the two entertainers now ridiculed each other
at events, in interviews and on recordings. In one song called "Hit
'Em Up," Shakur bragged about having sex with Wallace's wife and
vowed to kill him. The threats between the rappers and their labels,
Death Row and Bad Boy Entertainment, escalated into a series of
assaults and shootings--one of which resulted in the killing of a
Death Row bodyguard in Atlanta in 1995.</TE>
<TE>   Fearing for his safety, a friend of Wallace's arranged for the
Crips to supply bodyguards for the rapper whenever he traveled west.
Over the years, the gang was paid to provide security for Wallace at
casinos in Las Vegas, clubs in Hollywood and award shows in Los
Angeles. Besides cash, Wallace gave the gang access to stars,
groupies and the inner sanctums of the music business.</TE>
<TE>   Wallace began flashing Crips gang signs and calling out to the
homies at concerts, sometimes even inviting gang members on stage.
Privately, he prodded the gang to kill Shakur--and promised to pay
handsomely for the hit.</TE>
<TE>   On Sept. 7, 1996, the Crips decided to take him up on the offer.</TE>
<TE>   They sent an emissary to a penthouse suite at the MGM, where
Wallace was booked under a false name. In Vegas to party, he didn't
attend the Tyson-Seldon fight but had quickly learned about Shakur's
scuffle with Anderson. Wallace gathered a handful of thugs and East
Coast rap associates to hear what the Crips had to say.</TE>
<TE>   According to people who were present, the Crips envoy explained
that the gang was prepared to kill Shakur but expected to collect $1
million for its efforts. Wallace agreed, on one condition, a witness
said. He pulled out a loaded .40-caliber Glock pistol and placed it
on the table in front of him.</TE>
<TE>   He didn't just want Shakur dead. He wanted the satisfaction of
knowing the fatal bullet came from his gun.</TE>
<TE>   On the Strip</TE>
<TE>   It was a gangsta rap parade. Fans waved. Women flirted and asked
for autographs. Photographers snapped pictures.</TE>
<TE>   Knight was leading a caravan of at least five Death Row cars
heading toward Club 662. Shakur and Knight turned heads as the convoy
proceeded slowly north on Las Vegas Boulevard.</TE>
<TE>   Around 11 p.m., police stopped Knight for cranking the black BMW's
stereo too loud and not properly displaying its license plates.
Shakur and Knight joked with the officers and talked them out of
issuing a ticket. Then the BMW turned right on Flamingo Road and
headed east toward the club.</TE>
<TE>   Moments earlier, Anderson and three other Crips took an elevator
down to the Treasure Island lobby. They walked out into the valet
parking area.</TE>
<TE>   Hovering under the hotel's skull-and-crossbones logo, the four
Crips waited silently as the valet brought out a 1996 white Cadillac
and opened the doors. They piled in and eased the sleek new sedan
into traffic. A fifth Crip in an old yellow Cadillac met them at the
curb and followed close behind. He rode solo, with an AK-47 assault
rifle lying across the front seat.</TE>
<TE>   The traffic in front of Treasure Island was bumper to bumper. Cars
honked. Billboards flashed. Neon-lighted fountains trickled nearby.</TE>
<TE>   The driver of the white Cadillac lighted a cigarette. Behind him
sat Anderson. The Crip in the front passenger seat handed Anderson
the loaded Glock from Notorious B.I.G. The four men discussed staking
out the club where Shakur would perform.</TE>
<TE>   After waiting at a stoplight between Caesars Palace and the
Barbary Coast hotel, the Cadillacs turned onto Flamingo and headed
east toward Club 662.</TE>
<TE>   As they passed the Bally's hotel on the right, the driver saw a
caravan of luxury cars ahead on the left. The vehicles, packed with
Mob Piru Bloods and Death Row employees, were stopped at a red light
across from the Maxim Hotel. The crosswalk was filled with tourists.</TE>
<TE>   Leading the convoy was Knight's black BMW. Shakur was in the
passenger seat. They were alone in the car, unarmed.</TE>
<TE>   The Crips couldn't believe their luck. They decided to chuck their
plan and strike immediately.</TE>
<TE>   The Cadillac raced up on the convoy and pulled up beside the BMW.
Shakur didn't notice. He was flirting with a carful of women in a
lane to his left.</TE>
<TE>   "I saw four black men roll by in a white Cadillac," said Atlanta
rapper E.D.I. Mean, who was in the vehicle directly behind Shakur's.
"I saw a gun come from the back seat out through the driver's front
window."</TE>
<TE>   Bullets flew, shattering the windows of the BMW. Shakur tried to
duck into the rear of the car for cover, but four rounds hit him,
shredding his chest. Blood was everywhere.</TE>
<TE>   "We heard shots and looked to the right of us," Knight said.
"Tupac was trying to get in the back seat, and I grabbed him and
pulled him down. The gunshots kept coming. One hit my head."</TE>
<TE>   In the chaos, neither Knight nor Mean could make out who had
fired. The driver of the yellow Cadillac just behind the assailants
never got a chance to fire his AK-47.</TE>
<TE>   "It all happened so quick. It took three or four seconds at most,"
Mean said.</TE>
<TE>   Then the white Cadillac screeched around the corner. A bodyguard
near the back of the Death Row caravan fired at the fleeing sedan. In
a ruse designed to confuse Shakur's entourage, the Crip in the yellow
Cadillac chased the white Cadillac around the corner, as if in
hostile pursuit.</TE>
<TE>   Knight made a U-turn, his bullet-riddled BMW squealing around the
concrete median. The Death Row convoy followed him back to the Strip,
where he rammed his car onto a curb.</TE>
<TE>   Las Vegas police were soon on the scene. After summoning an
ambulance for Shakur, they ordered everyone else in the Death Row
convoy out of their cars at gunpoint. The police forced Knight, who
was bleeding from a head wound, to lie face down on the pavement.</TE>
<TE>   By the time the detectives figured out that Knight and his caravan
were victims, not suspects, the Crips had returned to their hotel
rooms and gathered their belongings.</TE>
<TE>   Staggering their departures to avoid attracting attention,
Anderson and his fellow gang members hit the highway, each in a
different car. Two younger gang members drove the white Cadillac back
across the desert.</TE>
<TE>   Interstate 15 moves fast at night.</TE>
<TE>   It was still dark when the Crips disappeared over the California
border.</TE>
<TE>   Epilogue</TE>
<TE>   Surgeons at University Medical Center in Las Vegas removed
Shakur's right lung in an attempt to stop the internal bleeding. When
his condition deteriorated, they put him on a ventilator. He died six
days after the shooting, with his mother at his side.</TE>
<TE>   Wallace returned to New York, where he recorded a CD called "Life
After Death," which has veiled references to the shooting in several
songs. According to the Crips, Wallace paid the gang $50,000 of the
promised $1 million through an intermediary a week after Shakur died.</TE>
<TE>   In March 1997, Wallace discussed his feud with Shakur during an
interview with a San Francisco radio station. Asked whether he had a
role in the rapper's death, Wallace said he "wasn't that powerful
yet."</TE>
<TE>   Three days later, Wallace was in Los Angeles for the Soul Train
Music Awards and an after-party at the Petersen Automotive Museum. He
was gunned down as he sat in his Chevrolet Blazer at a traffic light
on Wilshire Boulevard. No one has ever been charged in the killing.</TE>
<TE>   Two days after Shakur was shot, gang warfare erupted in Compton as
the Bloods sought revenge on the Crips. A rash of drive-by shootings
left three people dead and 12 injured, including a 10-year-old girl.
Informants told police that Anderson had been seen brandishing a
Glock pistol.</TE>
<TE>   Las Vegas police interviewed Anderson once. They said they could
not build a case against him as Shakur's killer because witnesses in
the rapper's entourage refused to cooperate with them.</TE>
<TE>   Anderson said he had nothing to do with Shakur's death. "If they
have all this evidence against me, then why haven't they arrested
me?" he said a year after the shooting. "It's obvious that I'm
innocent."</TE>
<TE>   Anderson was shot dead May 29, 1998, at a Compton carwash in a
dispute police say was unrelated to Shakur's slaying.</TE>
<TE>   The three other Crips who were in the white Cadillac that night in
Las Vegas still live in Compton. None of them has ever been
questioned by police about the crime.</TE>

<LD>The bitter feud between rappers Tupac Shakur and Notorious B.I.G. is
reflected in their song lyrics, as excerpted below.</LD>
<LD>   *</LD>
<LD>   'Who Shot Ya?'</LD>
<TE>   Notorious B.I.G.</TE>
<TE>   (Released in June 1995, eight months after gunmen ambushed Shakur
in a New York recording studio, wounding and robbing him. Bad Boy is

<TE>   Notorious B.I.G.</TE>
<TE>   (Released in March 1997, six months after Shakur's death. "My team
in marine blue" is believed to refer to the Southside Crips, whose
members wear blue.)</TE>
<TE>   See, I told y'all</TE>

<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>Gov. Gray Davis on Thursday signed into law a $99-billion budget that
came more than two months after the deadline in the state
Constitution and largely postpones difficult decisions on taxes and
spending until after this November's election.</LD>
<LD>   The budget bridges a $24-billion shortfall with relatively modest
program cuts. It contains no general tax increases and higher public
school spending. That combination virtually ensures that whoever wins
the election, Davis or his Republican challenger, Bill Simon Jr.,
will have to offer voters higher taxes and reduced government
services next year, experts warned.</LD>
<LD>   "It's a get-out-alive budget," Senate President Pro Tem John
Burton (D-San Francisco) said. "The problems next year, no matter
what happens, will be severe."</LD>
<TE>   Burton's judgment was echoed from the other side of the political
fence. "There's no question in my mind that the tough decisions have
been put on hold until after Nov. 5," said Sen. Bruce McPherson
(R-Santa Cruz).</TE>
<TE>   The budget depends heavily on loans, transfers between funds and
the hope that the federal government will come to Sacramento's aid.
It also assumes more cuts will come soon.</TE>
<TE>   Davis announced relatively small cuts Thursday, saying he had used
the governor's line-item veto authority to pare $235 million from the
budget. Most of the money, $177 million, was cut from the
$26.6-billion health and welfare budget. Davis is delaying a plan to
expand a program that offers health care to low-income parents whose
employers don't provide health insurance.</TE>
<TE>   The state will, however, expand the Healthy Families Program for
children of low-income parents, pushing up the number of people
enrolled to 624,000.</TE>
<TE>   The budget authorizes Davis to cut another $1 billion during the
course of the fiscal year, which ends June 30. The governor's aides
are working on plans for that, but offered few specifics Thursday on
what is to come.</TE>
<TE>   "It is not a perfect document," Davis said at a perfunctory event
in a Capitol conference room in which he said he regretted any
inconvenience caused by the delay. "But it does take an important
step in meeting the state's fiscal challenges."</TE>
<TE>   The budget largely protects spending on public schools, health
care and the state prison system, and imposes no general tax
increases. But by cutting back on some programs and not giving
increases to others, the $98.9-billion plan reduces spending from the
$101.3 billion of last fiscal year. It also reflects a 21% increase
over the budget Davis signed into law three years ago.</TE>
<TE>   Highlights of the budget include:</TE>
<TE>   * The state's spending on public schools will rise to $30.7
billion from last year's $29.9 billion. Sacramento will earmark
$7,067 per student in kindergarten through 12th grade, compared with
$6,610 last year; that's $1,300 more than the state spent when Davis
took office.</TE>
<TE>   * State revenues will go up as a result of $2.4 billion in
additional taxes and accelerated tax collections primarily borne by
businesses. Assembly Republicans succeeded in blocking, for now,
direct tax hikes affecting the general public. Given that Republicans
blocked Democrats from doubling the state car tax and raising tobacco
taxes to as much as $3 per pack, the governor can claim that taxes
are lower now than when he took office.</TE>
<TE>   * As part of the budget shortfall resolution, Davis is banking on
the federal government giving the state $1.1 billion to help cover
the cost of heightened security, health care for poor people and the
costs of incarcerating illegal immigrants. In the past, the federal
government has not come through with as much as Sacramento claims to
be owed.</TE>
<TE>   State Finance Director Tim Gage said the state will receive
anti-terrorism money, but he characterized as a longshot the state's
chance of receiving other blocks of federal money. The budget hole
will deepen if that money fails to materialize.</TE>
<TE>   The spending plan probably will present the state with a
$20-billion budget deficit and accompanying financial crisis come
January, economists said.</TE>
<TE>   "The good news is, it's a little less than the problem they didn't
deal with this year," said Ted Gibson, a former state economist who
now works as an economic advisor at Metropolitan West Securities in
Sacramento. "But the bad news is, they've done all the one-time
things they could do."</TE>
<TE>   Because of that, the governor and legislators will have difficulty
avoiding substantial tax increases and program cuts next year, Gibson
and other experts said.</TE>
<TE>   "I think the other shoe drops next year," said Jean Ross,
executive director of the California Budget Project, a Sacramento
watchdog group. "Barring a major turnaround in the economy, which
would be out of line with where the forecasters are headed, this
state will face very, very difficult policy choices."</TE>
<TE>   Thursday's subdued budget ceremony, Davis' fourth, marked a stark
contrast to the fanfare surrounding the first Davis budget in 1999,
when the newly elected Democratic governor was the beneficiary of a
surplus of more than $10 billion left by his Republican predecessor,
Pete Wilson.</TE>
<TE>   Back then, the governor emerged from the Capitol and walked to a
stage as music blared and hundreds of state workers, union members
and schoolchildren cheered.</TE>
<TE>   Davis called that first spending plan, signed two days before the
start of the new fiscal year, historic, and dedicated it to "the
children of this state" because of their sense of optimism and belief
that all things were possible. He was joined in 1999 by several
legislators, happy to share in the tax-funded celebration.</TE>
<TE>   On Thursday, only one lawmaker, termed-out Assemblyman Carl
Washington (D-Los Angeles), came to the budget signing.</TE>
<TE>   By signing the thick budget bill, Davis formally ended the long
impasse among Democratic and Republican legislators. The length of
the standoff surpassed the record of a decade ago, when Wilson was
confronted by a $14-billion shortfall caused by the state's worst
recession since the Great Depression.</TE>
<TE>   Republican lawmakers raised the specter of a state bankruptcy,
especially if plans go awry to sell $11.9 billion in bonds to pay for
electricity purchases made during last year's energy crisis. If the
sale falters, Davis would be forced to convene a special session of
the Legislature to raise taxes and cut spending, GOP lawmakers say.</TE>
<TE>   "We're going to be in the tank at the beginning of next year,"
said Sen. Dick Ackerman (R-Irvine), the lead Senate Republican on
budget matters. "Basically, we're borrowed out. All the tricks you
can do have been done, and you can't do them twice. [Davis] needed to
take some steps this year, and he didn't do it.</TE>
<TE>   "To make it go next year, he'll have to raise taxes. But he
doesn't want to do that prior to the election. On the other hand,
he'll also have to cut spending. But he doesn't want to do that
either prior to the election. He doesn't want to level with people."</TE>
<TE>   Even some administration officials say privately that taxes and
fees will rise next year, although Davis himself would not address
the issue Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   "I have no expectations one way or another about next year's
budget," Davis said. "It is absolutely foolhardy to talk about next
year's budget until we get through all the spending implications of
this year."</TE>
<TE>   But while Davis may not wish to discuss possibilities for next
time, budget experts say the likely sources to tap for new revenue
would include several increases offered but not adopted this year:
tobacco, car taxes, a new tax on satellite television, changing the
property tax structure so that businesses pay a larger share and
reinstating higher income tax brackets for upper-income Californians.</TE>
<TE>   "We're hearing already those issues will be in play," said Larry
McCarthy, president of the California Taxpayers Assn.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to revenue increases, Davis' aides are working on a
list of ways to trim the additional $1 billion that the budget allows
the governor to cut.</TE>
<TE>   Gage said $750 million will be cut from government operations
between now and June in an "ambitious" plan.</TE>
<TE>   The state hopes to save another $285 million by reducing its work
force by 7,000 positions. However, there will be few if any layoffs.
Rather, savings will come as the state withholds money earmarked to
fill those jobs. Gage acknowledged that there has been debate over
the question of whether eliminating vacant positions actually saves
the state money.</TE>

<HD>Teachers Look for the Lessons of Sept. 11</HD>
<DH>Education: The tragedy is seen as a source of insight, but
instructors are wary of debate.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ERIKA HAYASAKI and JOE MATHEWS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>David Massey has given his students at Chatsworth High School an
unusual weekend homework assignment. Find and tape television footage
of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks and bring it to school for extra
credit.</LD>
<LD>   The tapes will form the basis of a lesson Massey is planning for
his advanced film and video studies class on Wednesday, the first
anniversary of the deadly attack.</LD>
<LD>   "We'll look at the imagery of Sept. 11, how they were broadcast
and how they entered the memories of people," said Massey, an
Oscar-nominated maker of short films. "There is no video imagery more
powerful than 9/11 that the United States has seen. Those planes will
be etched in us as long as we live."</LD>
<TE>   Teachers around the country are preparing to replay Sept. 11 next
week in many ways. The anniversary has emerged as an occasion for
special lessons on history and techtechnology, poetry and psychology,
art and architecture, hatred and patriotism.</TE>
<TE>   But many classroom instructors are wary of being drawn into
political, emotional and pedagogical debate over how to teach about
terror, its causes and aftermath.</TE>
<TE>   Should the subject be avoided or open for discussion among
students? Should teachers point the finger at terrorists or preach
tolerance? Should they talk about emotion and feelings or history and
politics?</TE>
<TE>   "It's not an easy subject, but I don't see how we could avoid it,"
said Nancy Goldberg, an English teacher at Culver City High School,
where one student lost a parent in one of the hijacked planes. "I
want to deal with it in a personalized way, but you don't want to get
maudlin about it."</TE>
<TE>   Goldberg and colleagues have been passing around short stories and
poems that deal with the subject of loss but do not mention the
terrorist attacks. They will meet a day or two ahead of time to
decide how to approach the subject on Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   Many teachers across the country, busy with back-to-school duties,
have said they haven't had time to complete their anniversary lesson
plans.</TE>
<TE>   Others said that strict state guidelines on classroom content--in
California as well as other states--leave little time or room to
devote to Sept. 11 topics. Other teachers are procrastinating out of
distaste for reliving such a tragic day. Still others, worried about
parental or student backlash over such a sensitive topic, are
consulting colleagues and principals more extensively than ever.</TE>
<TE>   Many teachers plan to keep discussions tightly focused on factual
presentations or history. Audrey O'Keefe, an art history teacher at
Jordan High School in South-Central Los Angeles, said she plans to
discuss the architecture of New York's World Trade Center and the
valuable artwork that was lost in the Twin Towers.</TE>
<TE>   She will avoid discussing emotions. "We don't want to drag them
through something that they might not be ready to emotionally
remember," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Some teachers said they are relying heavily on the Internet for
material. With the anniversary approaching, groups including
Teachers.net Gazette, the National Education Assn., the Red Cross,
the Families and Work Institute, and Teen People magazine have
created lesson plans or tips for teachers.</TE>
<TE>   Much attention has been focused on the NEA's suggested curricula
for Sept. 11. Among more than 100 lesson plans, which were submitted
by teachers, the teachers' union site, www.nea.org, features links to
pages about the internment of Japanese Americans during World War II
and an essay calling for tolerance. It also includes links to 60
organizations, including the CIA, the American Legion, FOX News, PBS,
the White House and the Red Cross.</TE>
<TE>   Some conservatives have been outraged by what they saw as a
possible plea for understanding of terrorists. "The NEA, clearly a
union out of step with the vast majority of the country's fine
teachers, should be roundly condemned for their 'blame America'
approach to teaching our children about 911," said Katherine Smith, a
Republican candidate for California superintendent of public
instruction, in a typical broadside against the NEA Web site.</TE>
<TE>   But Kathleen Lyons, an NEA spokeswoman, said such criticism is
inappropriate and misinformed.</TE>
<TE>   "It is designed for you to pick and choose ideas, just as teachers
do on a variety of subjects," Lyons said. "If you actually go on the
site, you're certainly not left with the impression that we're trying
to blame America."</TE>
<TE>   The NEA has stressed that the controversial link was meant to make
sure that all Muslims are not smeared.</TE>
<TE>   Beyond ideology, some teachers have said they prefer to focus on
emotion, tapping into students' sorrow, fear or anger through poetry,
journal entries or plays. Some plan to devote class time to charity
work, raising money for victims' families, writing letters or making
quilts and art.</TE>
<TE>   Lyn Lathrop, a sixth-grade teacher at St. Lawrence School in
Rochester, N.Y., said she would have her students write about what
they remember and whether their lives have changed in the past year.</TE>
<TE>   "It won't be graded or corrected," she said. "It will just 'be,'
and will record whatever they are feeling and thinking at that time."
Lathrop said she would avoid talking about Afghanistan or terrorism.
"I have a hard time teaching about Sept. 11 because I do not, cannot,
understand the incomprehensible," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Experts disagree over the extent to which classroom discussion
should focus on emotional responses. The Thomas B. Fordham
Foundation, a Washington research group, compiled a suggested
curriculum heavy on civics that rejects advice from "people who would
psychologize the topic or whose reverence for tolerance dwarfs their
appreciation of other compelling civic values."</TE>
<TE>   In a different vein, Richard Lieberman, a spokesman for the
National Assn. of School Psychologists who also heads a suicide
prevention program for the Los Angeles Unified School District, said
teachers should try to encourage younger students to use artwork or
puppets to express their feelings. Older students should be able to
watch television coverage of the anniversary and learn lessons of
history, politics, war, terrorism--as well as personal loss or fear.</TE>
<TE>   At Sylmar High School, library media teacher Marc McPhee drafted a
memo this week outlining Internet and library resources and showing
how lessons might fit with California standards in language arts and
social sciences.</TE>
<TE>   "I think most of our teachers will find a way to address the
subject," McPhee said. "But in the age of the Internet, it will
really come from people looking at what other teachers are doing and
choosing what works for them individually."</TE>
<TE>   Some students say they understand the need to commemorate the day
but don't wish to dwell on the details of the attacks. At Culver City
High, the student government will hand out yellow ribbons, and a
school club, the Student Intercultural Advisory Committee, will
dedicate a new "Peace Garden." Julie Odano, a junior who helped put
the garden together, said she sees the day as an opportunity to
"focus on people coming together in the future."</TE>
<TE>   "I know my U.S. history teacher is probably going to talk about
it, and I understand that," said Odano, 16. "But I hope it's going to
be a regular academic day. We've heard so much about 9/11. We have to
move on, to talk about peace. We don't want people to relive that day
and be upset all over again."</TE>
<TE>   A Culver senior, Jenny Roth, said the student government had
discussed how to approach the day. "Pretty much the school vibe was
that we, as students, should do something," said Roth, 17. "It was an
important date on our lives. At the same time, we don't want to dwell
on it, to look at it as a negative event."</TE>
<TE>   Teachers said they want to be scrupulously even-handed in dealing
with the event, as a matter of good teaching.</TE>
<TE>   At San Clemente High School, the students of one European history
teacher, Kathleen Sigafoos, will analyze newspapers from a day after,
a month after and a year after the attacks for a lesson on how
perspectives change over time.</TE>
<TE>   Chris Bryant, a teacher at Detroit City High School in Michigan,
said teachers should blame terrorist groups, but they should also
address America's faults.</TE>
<TE>   "If a student asked me why anyone would attack the U.S., I would
tell them that, overseas, we do have an image of being arrogant and
ignorant," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of the time, we are shielded to what many other groups of
people think about us," Bryant said.</TE>
<TE>   A San Clemente High teacher, Rickie Lundgren, will have her
students write about the heroes of Sept. 11--either someone who died
that day or someone whose actions after the event earned that title.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not trying to just make them feel sad all over again, but I
want them to get more personally involved and active in it," Lundgren
said. "Students need to get a real sense that the event touched all
of us."</TE>
<TE>   They will also discuss world religions and their role in the
event, along with people's changed tolerance and perceptions of
different cultures.</TE>
<TE>   At Chandler Elementary School in Van Nuys, fifth-grade teacher
Robert Garrett gave his 31 students a homework assignment: to write a
speech on the meaning of Sept. 11. The author of the strongest
submission will be asked to recite it at a school ceremony on
Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   Before the speech, each class will help put together a banner that
will extend around the school perimeter. On it, students will write
what America means to them.</TE>
<TE>   "I think young people really should just see the good in humanity
and see how people were able to pull together," Garrett said. After
the attacks, he posted across the top of a classroom bulletin board
the slogan, "United We Stand and Divided We Fall."</TE>
<TE>   "It will probably stay like that," Garrett said, "forever."</TE>

<HD>Van Nuys May Get Last Laugh</HD>
<DH>Having devolved from idyll to punch line, the suburb is
nevertheless a logical place to serve as headquarters for an
independent Valley city.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SUE FOX</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Born in a barley field, Van Nuys was packaged 91 years ago as "the
largest opportunity on the entire Pacific Coast" and sold to eager
buyers for $350 per sunbaked lot.</LD>
<LD>   The booming suburb became the heart of the San Fernando Valley, an
all-American town of bungalows nesting on crisp green lawns. It was a
cultural hub for teenagers cruising in flashy cars and a government
center complete with a scaled-down version of Los Angeles City Hall.</LD>
<LD>   But like the Valley itself, Van Nuys has tumbled in much of the
public imagination from an idyllic home to a lame punch line.</LD>
<TE>   "The very armpit of the Earth," Sandra Tsing Loh, author of "A
Year in Van Nuys," joked about her hometown at one book-signing. "Van
Nuys is walking down a red carpet, being a friend of a friend, or a
friend of a friend of a friend, and the paparazzi take one breathless
look at you and ... turn away to reload."</TE>
<TE>   Now, however, the aging suburb has a chance to reclaim a bit of
the old glory. As secessionists press their case for Valley
independence, they have thrust Van Nuys back into the spotlight--this
time as the potential headquarters of a new city.</TE>
<TE>   It remains a vivid example of the impulses that drive
secession--the sense of neglect and disrepair that some Valley
residents feel has been inflicted on them by a distant and
indifferent City Hall, and the notion that potential is being
overlooked.</TE>
<TE>   "We've been dissed," said Armand Arabian, a retired state Supreme
Court justice who keeps a law office in Van Nuys. "We're ready to
control our own lives, and you watch and see if we don't step up to
the plate. We've got everything we need here in Van Nuys."</TE>
<TE>   A Golden Beginning</TE>
<TE>   It wasn't always so grim.</TE>
<TE>   Van Nuys was once the place to be, the epitome of the good life in
sunny Southern California. It literally boomed into being in a single
day: Feb. 22, 1911.</TE>
<TE>   That's when developer William Paul Whitsett threw a giant barbecue
to promote 47,500 acres of dusty earth. He divided the land into
lots, hired a swarm of workers to build streets and called every
person in Los Angeles who had a telephone to invite them out for the
day.</TE>
<TE>   Thousands of curious customers trekked to Van Nuys (named after
the previous landowner, wheat farmer Isaac Newton Van Nuys).</TE>
<TE>   "The Golden Harvest You Will Reap," trumpeted a 1911 advertisement
in The Times. "Scores are building homes and planting their land to
fruit and vegetables. Fortunes will be made!" (Whitsett, for one,
raked in $250,000 on opening day.)</TE>
<TE>   For its first 50 years, Van Nuys fairly burbled with optimism. By
1961--the year a group of West Valley businessmen began clamoring for
secession--Van Nuys had become a major commercial center. It was home
to 115,000 people, many of them professionals from the aerospace and
electronics industries.</TE>
<TE>   But over the next two decades, a dramatic shift in shopping and
housing patterns altered the landscape. Indoor shopping malls popped
up across the Valley, draining Van Nuys of profitable department
stores and specialty shops.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, city planners rezoned many neighborhoods to
allow high-density apartment buildings, which drew many more
low-income families to Van Nuys.</TE>
<TE>   Those changes transformed parts of Van Nuys, converting it from an
affluent suburban community to one with swaths of poverty.</TE>
<TE>   Forty years later, faded Craftsman houses are wedged between
cinder-block apartment buildings. Schools are plunked down beside
industrial strips of auto shops.</TE>
<TE>   Once largely white, Van Nuys has diversified along with the rest
of Los Angeles. More than half its 167,000 residents--51%--are
Latino, and 37% are white. Blacks and Asians each represent about 6%
of the population, according to the 2000 census.</TE>
<TE>   The stable base of homeowners here has eroded over the years as
people sold their land to apartment builders. Two-thirds of the
area's housing units are now rentals, according to census data.</TE>
<TE>   "It's like 'Blade Runner' with all these cell block apartments,"
said Tony Austin, 44, a graphic designer who grew up in Van Nuys and
supports Valley cityhood. "It all boils down to density. When you put
a bunch of young males in such a small space, you're going to get the
problems that L.A. has, which are crime and gang violence."</TE>
<TE>   Violent crime has increased 64% in the Van Nuys Division during
the past year, compared to an 8% jump citywide, according to LAPD
data.</TE>
<TE>   Just half a block away from the LAPD's Van Nuys complex,
13-year-old Arneisha Davis passes a gutted Trans Am, windows smashed
and trunk open. The initials of a local gang, Barrio Van Nuys, are
splashed across sidewalks and fence posts.</TE>
<TE>   "Everybody around here is in gangs," said Arneisha, who is going
into the eighth grade. "Out here, you got to worry about somebody
looking at you the wrong way."</TE>
<TE>   The area's once-proud main street, Van Nuys Boulevard, has become
a dense thicket of pawnshops and swap meets. Mini-secession movements
have erupted as thousands of residents--claiming that the Van Nuys
name was dragging down property values--won city permission to rename
their neighborhoods Valley Glen and Lake Balboa.</TE>
<TE>   The community commands so little respect that it's been chopped
into five council districts, making local improvements difficult to
coordinate.</TE>
<TE>   With its City Hall replica, state and federal buildings,
courthouses and the Los Angeles Police Department's Valley
headquarters, Van Nuys already functions as the Valley's government
center. But it looks more ragged than regal.</TE>
<TE>   The grass around the Valley Municipal Building has gone brown for
want of water. The Art Deco-style building was badly damaged in the
1994 Northridge earthquake. The city put off repairs for years.
Employees began wearing hard hats to ward off falling debris.</TE>
<TE>   Doing It Themselves</TE>
<TE>   Dave Wilke has learned not to count on city services to keep the
area safe and clean.</TE>
<TE>   Wilke, who manages the Valley Book and Bible store on Van Nuys
Boulevard, hired a crew to power-wash the sidewalks in front of his
store. He had his own workers trim the palm trees. And when a drunk
wandered in and tried to grab a salesgirl, it was up to Wilke to get
him out. (He called the police, he said, but they didn't show up for
half an hour.)</TE>
<TE>   "If people don't have the perception that it's safe and clean,"
Wilke said of Van Nuys, "they don't come here to shop."</TE>
<TE>   It's not that city officials haven't tried to spruce up Van
Nuys--they've been trying for 30 years.</TE>
<TE>   Programs have come and gone, from "Vitalize Van Nuys" in the 1970s
to today's "Targeted Neighborhood Initiative" along two blighted
stretches of Van Nuys Boulevard.</TE>
<TE>   Millions have been spent, most recently to paint the facades of
worn businesses, install new awnings and jazz up the crosswalks with
a little faux brick. Even one of the adult video stores (currently an
eye-popping yellow) has signed up for a paint job.</TE>
<TE>   The city has approved an ordinance to keep more swap meets and
pawnshops from moving in. Police have cracked down on the prostitutes
roaming Sepulveda Boulevard, and residents and merchants have formed
a neighborhood council.</TE>
<TE>   And after two decades of talking about it, the city is finally
building a $34-million government center here to serve Valley
dwellers.</TE>
<TE>   The changes are subtle. People who have lived in Van Nuys for
years say it's looking slightly better. Off the main corridors, there
are still some leafy streets lined with ranch homes, survivors of the
community's ups and downs.</TE>
<TE>   But Bruce Ackerman gets gloomy each time he drives through Van
Nuys.</TE>
<TE>   "I spent 11 years pouring my heart into this area," said Ackerman,
who worked for the local Chamber of Commerce from 1976 to 1987. "Now
I go back there and I say, my God, what did we accomplish?</TE>
<TE>   "I can look at downtown L.A., at Staples Center, the hotels, the
Convention Center and anything and everything that has been ushered
in and promoted by the city of L.A. And then I look out here and I
say, what in the hell has been done out here like that?"</TE>
<TE>   Seceding in Name</TE>
<TE>   Such are the slights--real and imagined--that fuel the talk of
secession in and around Van Nuys.</TE>
<TE>   Taken together, the steady drip of indignities over many years has
persuaded thousands of residents that they'd be better off in a
Valley city.</TE>
<TE>   By the 1990s, people were clamoring to get out of Van Nuys--at
least in name. Breakaway movements led by disgruntled homeowners
persuaded City Hall to re-christen large swaths of the area.</TE>
<TE>   Although the splits didn't involve new governments--the whole
querulous area remained part of L.A.--proponents argued that
disassociating from Van Nuys' tainted image would boost home prices.
Van Nuys was a "cesspool" they said, a "ghetto" and "something you
have to say under your breath."</TE>
<TE>   First an old Jewish enclave near Valley College defected, calling
itself Valley Glen. In April, a two-square-mile section of west Van
Nuys jumped ship.</TE>
<TE>   Hundreds of residents cheered as Councilman Dennis Zine unveiled
the new blue signs welcoming people to Lake Balboa. It's named after
a small lake nearby--in Encino.</TE>
<TE>   "They didn't waste a minute getting their signs up," grumbled
Prudy Schultz, a community activist and fierce defender of all things
Van Nuys. When she sought similar signs for Van Nuys, she said, it
took two years to get city approval.</TE>
<TE>   For years, Schultz and her husband, Don, who heads the local
homeowners group, supported secession as a way to improve the area.
Local control, they figured, would bring in leaders familiar with the
dirty sidewalks, graffiti, poor planning and neglect they saw
clouding their community.</TE>
<TE>   Just as important, they viewed secession as a chance to end Van
Nuys' balkanization, its division into so many council districts that
each had little attachment to the community.</TE>
<TE>   But when they saw how the proposed Valley city mapped out its
council seats, they changed their minds.</TE>
<TE>   Instead of five districts, Van Nuys would get ... six.</TE>
<TE>   Don Schultz was so angry that he promptly signed on with the
anti-secessionists. Under the city of Los Angeles' new redistricting
plan, most of Van Nuys--shrunken as it has become--is now in one
council district.</TE>
<TE>   "I can see light at the end of the tunnel," Schultz said. "But the
tunnel's too long."</TE>

<HD>Catholic Bishops Retool Committee on Sex Abuse</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The nation's Roman Catholic bishops said Thursday that they have
restructured their committee that drafts policies on how dioceses
should discipline priests who molest children.</LD>
<LD>   Two panel members who were criticized heavily by victim
advocates--Bishop John McCormack of Manchester, N.H., and Auxiliary
Bishop A. James Quinn of Cleveland--have been removed and the
eight-member panel has been expanded to 15.</LD>
<LD>   The expansion of the Ad Hoc Committee on Sexual Abuse was included
in the reform plan the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops adopted in
June, hoping to ease the clerical sex abuse crisis fracturing the
church.</LD>
<TE>   The new committee will oversee a review of that plan in two years,
and will discuss possible local and national meetings with victims.</TE>
<TE>   The panel also will meet with the heads of religious orders, such
as the Franciscans and Benedictines, who last month adopted a less
stringent abuse policy than the bishops, refusing to oust errant
clergy from all church work and instead pledging to help them
rehabilitate. The bishops agreed to remove guilty priests from public
ministry, and in some cases, the priesthood altogether.</TE>
<TE>   Bishop Wilton Gregory, the conference president, had removed
McCormack as chairman of the Ad Hoc Committee this year, though
McCormack had stayed on the panel. Before becoming bishop in New
Hampshire, McCormack was an administrator in the Boston Archdiocese
and is now a defendant in civil abuse cases in Massachusetts.</TE>
<TE>   Quinn had angered victims in a speech on church law he gave years
ago, when he suggested church leaders could send documents related to
abuse cases to Vatican officials, who have immunity from civil
authorities.</TE>
<TE>   Archbishop Harry Flynn of St. Paul and Minneapolis will remain
chairman of the committee.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>A lawyer for three men convicted of the 1989 "wilding" rape and
beating of a jogger in New York's Central Park said he hopes to clear
their names with a confession from a convicted murderer.</LD>
<LD>   Michael Warren said Matias Reyes, 31, a convicted killer and
rapist, has told defense investigators he attacked the woman and that
prosecutors have told him his DNA matches a sample found at the
scene.</LD>
<LD>   Reyes is serving 33 years to life on unrelated charges. Warren
said the inmate would not face charges in the 1989 attack because the
statute of limitations has expired.</LD>
<TE>   The victim, a 28-year-old investment banker, was near death when
police found her. She was in a coma 12 days.</TE>
<TE>   Police rounded up more than 30 teens they suspected had been part

<LD>Despite popular ads featuring milk-mustached athletes and rock stars,
teenage girls drink less milk as they grow older and instead quench
their thirst with sugar-concentrated soda, a study says.</LD>
<LD>   A U.S. Agriculture Department study of girls ages 12 through 19
found that the youngest drink the most milk and the least soda.</LD>
<LD>   In a survey of 732 girls, 78% of 12-year-olds drank milk, while
consuming only nine ounces of soda per day. The 19-year-olds gulped
down 14 ounces of soda per day and only 36% drank milk.</LD>

unsuspecting victims, then make their deaths look like accidents. The
suspects allegedly collected hundreds of thousands of dollars.</LD>

<HD>2 Columbine Parents Sue Former Deputy</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>DENVER</DL>
<LD>The parents of a student killed during the Columbine massacre are
suing a former Arapahoe County sheriff's deputy who told them he saw
the boy shot.</LD>
<LD>   In the lawsuit, Daniel Rohrbough's parents, Brian Rohrbough and
Sue Petrone, accuse James Taylor of lying when he told them he saw
Daniel shot during the April 20, 1999, attack and in later denying
that he ever said he witnessed the boy's death.</LD>
<LD>   Taylor's statements about the shooting, secretly recorded by
Petrone a year after the shooting, were part of the evidence that led
Rohrbough and Petrone to allege that their son was fatally shot by a
Denver police officer.</LD>
<TE>   The assertion prompted an independent investigation by the El Paso
County Sheriff's Office. It determined that Eric Harris, who helped
plot the massacre, fired the fatal shot.</TE>
<TE>   The lawsuit accuses Taylor of telling "false and outrageous lies"
to Rohrbough and Petrone about the death of their son and for failing
to recant the statements once it became clear they would be the basis
of a federal lawsuit. It seeks unspecified damages and a trial before
a jury.</TE>
<TE>   Taylor could not immediately be reached for comment.</TE>
<TE>   Daniel Rohrbough was 15 years old when he was shot and killed
along with 11 other students and a teacher. Harris and Dylan Klebold
also wounded more than 20 others before killing themselves.</TE>
<TE>   According to the lawsuit, on several occasions Taylor told
Rohrbough and Petrone, longtime family friends, that he saw the boy
shot and killed. He said he didn't know it was Daniel until the day
after the rampage, when Petrone showed him an aerial picture in a
newspaper of the boy dead on a sidewalk outside the school.</TE>
<TE>   In the April 2000 taped conversation, Taylor told the same story.
Though Taylor never said he saw a police officer fire, his version of
events, including the timing of the boy's death and the location of
officers at the school, led the parents to form their theory,
according to the lawsuit.</TE>
<TE>   Based in part on that conversation, Rohrbough and Petrone sued
Jefferson County authorities, accusing an unnamed law officer of
accidentally killing Daniel in the confusion of Columbine. They did
not name Taylor as their source.</TE>
<TE>   After a federal judge dismissed the lawsuit, the couple tried to
revive the suit by naming Taylor. Taylor then told his boss that he
never said anything to the Rohrbough family about seeing shots fired
at Columbine. He was fired after Rohrbough and Petrone produced the
tape.</TE>

<HD>Curb Student Credit Cards, Congress Told</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>More college students are overusing credit cards, academics and
policy makers said Thursday as they urged Congress to act on the
problem.</LD>
<LD>   "Often it's their unknowing parents who end up dealing with the
debt," Ellen Frishberg, director of student financial services at
Johns Hopkins University, told the Senate Banking Committee.</LD>
<LD>   Of undergraduates, 83% had at least one credit card last year, up
from 67% in 1998, according to a study by Nellie Mae, a provider of
student loans. The proportion of students with four or more credit
cards jumped from 27% to 47% in that period, the study found.</LD>
<TE>   The Education Department recently found that more than 44% of
college students carried a balance on a credit card during the
1999-2000 school year. Among those students, the average credit card
debt was $3,066. It was the first year such data were collected.</TE>
<TE>   Robert Manning, an economic sociologist at the Rochester Institute
of Technology, testified that credit card companies were increasingly
marketing to freshmen rather than just juniors and seniors, as in
years past.</TE>
<TE>   "It means that the debt burden is going to show up earlier,"
Manning said.</TE>
<TE>   "It means that retention in college is going to be affected, and
we're going to see an increase in dropout rates."</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Christopher J. Dodd (D-Conn.) said he would order a General
Accounting Office investigation into the marketing of credit cards on
campuses. He also said he would pursue legislation to boost financial
literacy among students.</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Phil Gramm (R-Texas) is among the lawmakers who see no need
for restricting college students' access to credit cards.</TE>
<TE>   "They can be drafted. They can start a business. They can get
married," Gramm said. "I do think we have to be careful in a free
society about how far we're going to go in restricting people's
rights."</TE>

<HD>Study Finds Rising Drug Use Among Youths</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>America has almost 16 million illegal drug users, including one in
five young adults, according to a government survey that suggests use
of marijuana and cocaine may be on the rise after leveling off in
recent years.</LD>
<LD>   Among ages 12 to 17, the youngest people surveyed, 10.8% were
described as current drug users in 2001, up from about 9.7% the year
before, according to the National Household Survey on Drug Abuse.</LD>
<LD>   Young adults 18 to 25 were more likely to be users, increasing to
18.8% from 15.9% in 2000. The rate of drug use among adults 26 and
older stayed about the same, at 4.5%. Current users are those who
reported using a drug within the past month.</LD>
<TE>   Although a few drugs, including LSD, are diminishing in
popularity, others are seeing big gains. The number of people who
have tried Ecstasy increased from 6.5 million in 2000 to 8.1 million
last year, the survey shows.</TE>
<TE>   Nonmedical use of the pain reliever Oxycontin more than doubled,
from 399,000 users in 2000 to 957,000 in 2001.</TE>
<TE>   The survey shows moderate increases in the use of marijuana and
cocaine by teenagers and young adults from 2000 to 2001. But
researchers said it was too soon to say whether that marks the
reversal of a trend of stable or declining drug use since the late
1990s.</TE>
<TE>   "It could continue up and be the start of a long-term trend, or it
could go down again," said Joe Gfroerer, director of the survey by
the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration. "We
don't try to predict that."</TE>
<TE>   Other national surveys saw no statistically significant increase
in drug use in 2001, and some even reported declines among young
people. The National Household Survey on Drug Abuse is the largest
study, interviewing almost 69,000 people age 12 or older and
including every state.</TE>
<TE>   Health officials, noting that the number of people who perceived
smoking marijuana once or twice a week as risky dropped to 53%,
blamed baby boomer parents for failing to take the risks of pot
smoking seriously and warning their children.</TE>
<TE>   The survey also found an increase in the number of people who
would benefit from drug treatment.</TE>

<HD>Fire Suspect's Confession Is Admissible</HD>
<DH>Courts: A former Forest Service employee has pleaded not
guilty to starting a massive blaze in Colorado. She faces at least 17
years in prison.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TOM GORMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>DENVER</DL>
<LD>A former U.S. Forest Service employee's confession that she started
the largest fire in Colorado's history will be admissible when her
trial begins in January, a federal judge ruled Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   The attorney for Terry Lynn Barton, 38, had sought to suppress her
confession, claiming that she was effectively in the custody of
federal investigators when she gave it and had not been read her
Miranda rights to remain silent and seek an attorney.</LD>
<LD>   But U.S. District Judge Richard P. Matsch agreed Thursday with
prosecutors that Barton freely admitted starting the fire in June
during questioning by Forest Service criminal investigators. Barton
immediately was advised of her Miranda rights after confessing and
was arrested the next morning.</LD>
<TE>   Barton, who has since been fired, has pleaded not guilty to
federal charges of willfully setting fire to timber, underbrush and
other materials that turned into the 137,000-acre Hayman fire that
burned for weeks 40 miles southwest of Denver, destroying 133 homes.</TE>
<TE>   Barton worked as a forest protection officer in Pike National
Forest. She initially was credited with discovering what she said was
an out-of-control campfire that she attempted to extinguish.</TE>
<TE>   But during her third interview with investigators, who said her
account didn't add up, Barton tearfully admitted that she put a match
to a letter from her estranged husband, igniting the fire.</TE>
<TE>   Barton made her admission while being questioned by two Forest
Service investigators who employed a "good cop, bad cop" interview
approach.</TE>
<TE>   Warren R. Williamson, Barton's public defender, argued Thursday
that, because investigators had taken her to an isolated
location--the origin of the fire--to question her and did not allow a
supervisor to accompany her, Barton was effectively "in custody" and
should have been advised of her right to remain silent.</TE>
<TE>   But the investigators testified that Barton was told she was free
to leave if she wanted.</TE>
<TE>   After hearing the testimony, the judge ruled that while the
investigators strategized on how to elicit a confession from Barton,
her admission was not coerced.</TE>
<TE>   If convicted on all four counts in connection with the blaze,
Barton faces a mandatory prison term of at least 17 years.</TE>
<TE>   The Hayman fire was one of three devastating blazes across the
West this summer in which people face federal prosecution for
allegedly igniting them.</TE>
<TE>   In Arizona, Leonard Gregg, 29, a contract firefighter for the
Bureau of Indian Affairs, faces trial Nov. 5 in the Rodeo fire on the
Fort Apache Indian Reservation near Show Low. Federal prosecutors
allege Gregg started the blaze to make money as an $8-an-hour
firefighter. Gregg could face up to 10 years in prison if convicted.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors decided not to charge a hiker for starting the nearby
Chediski fire, which merged with the Rodeo fire. Collectively they
burned about 469,000 acres, destroying nearly 500 homes and forcing
the evacuation of about 30,000 people. The U.S. attorney's office in
Phoenix concluded that Valinda Elliott, who was lost in the
reservation's woodlands for two days, showed no criminal intent when
she started a fire to attract the attention of a news helicopter,
which rescued her.</TE>
<TE>   And in California, a 45-year-old Bakersfield woman faces federal
prosecution for allegedly building an illegal campfire in July that
touched off the 150,000-acre McNally fire in Sequoia and Inyo
national forests. Peri Van Brunt told investigators she planned to
cook hot dogs but the campfire quickly spread out of control.</TE>
<TE>   Van Brunt faces a maximum prison term of five years if convicted.
A pretrial hearing is scheduled for Nov. 25.</TE>

<HD>Panel Urges Doubling Exercise, Eating 'Healthy' Fats</HD>
<DH>Nutrition: New report emphasizes physical activity over the
restriction of calories.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MELINDA FULMER and JANE E. ALLEN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Acknowledging that Americans are getting fatter, an independent panel
of top nutritionists on Thursday recommended doubling the amount of
exercise previously thought necessary to stay healthy while setting
less rigid dietary guidelines.</LD>
<LD>   The groundbreaking report, prepared for U.S. government health and
nutrition agencies by the Institute of Medicine's Food and Nutrition
Board, urges people to eat more "healthy" fats and allows for
significantly more added sugars in the diet, a recommendation that
some critics say could discourage consumers from getting all the
daily vitamins and nutrients they need.</LD>
<LD>   The recommendations, last updated by the board in 1989, could lead
to significant changes in food labeling, analysts said, and
ultimately affect the U.S. Department of Agriculture's closely
followed list of recommended daily food requirements known as the
food pyramid.</LD>
<TE>   "I think it's going to be difficult for USDA not to change the
food pyramid [based on these recommendations]," said Dr. Walter
Willett, nutrition and epidemiology professor at Harvard School of
Public Health. "The top part of the pyramid is going to get bigger."</TE>
<TE>   The report by the institute, which is part of the National Academy
of Sciences, stressed physical activity over the restriction of
calories, recommending an hour of moderate exercise every day, such
as brisk walking. That's double the amount recommended by the U.S.
surgeon general and much more than what the majority of Americans
accomplish.</TE>
<TE>   More than 60% of Americans are not physically active on a regular
basis and 25% aren't active at all.</TE>
<TE>   "We recognize that lifestyles of many in the United States ...
might make this goal seem difficult to achieve," panel chair Joanne
Lupton, a professor of nutrition at Texas A&amp;M University, said at a
briefing.</TE>
<TE>   The report spells out how many calories a person should eat based
on weight and activity but avoids discussing what kinds of foods to
eat. Instead the report set guidelines to accommodate a broad range
of diets from low-fat Asian fare to Mediterranean, which is higher in
good fats.</TE>
<TE>   Specifically, the report said that in the average person's diet,
protein should make up 10% to 35%, carbohydrates 45% to 65% and fat
should be between 20% and 35% of calories consumed.</TE>
<TE>   "We have to have people think about what they're eating as they
think about what their activity level is," said George A. Brooks, an
exercise physiologist and a member of the panel that compiled the
report.</TE>
<TE>   These findings allow for people to consume a larger amount of
"good" or monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fat than previously
recommended.</TE>
<TE>   "The main thrust of the pyramid has been the avoidance of fat.
This is a big departure from that," Willett said.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, the report condemned the 1990s' low-fat craze, warning
that low levels of fat combined with very high levels of
carbohydrates increased the risk of heart disease by lowering
high-density lipoproteins or so-called good cholesterol.</TE>
<TE>   The report also warned against eating foods that contain saturated
fat and trans-fatty acids, often found in cookies, crackers, meat,
full-fat dairy products and fast food. These fats play no role in a
healthy diet, the report said, and increase the risk of heart disease
by boosting levels of "bad" cholesterol. They should be avoided as
much as possible while still getting the protein and fiber needed for
a healthy diet, the report said.</TE>
<TE>   The Food and Drug Administration has already proposed a rule to
include the amount of trans-fat on food labels so consumers can track
the amount they're getting. That rule should be completed next year,
FDA officials say.</TE>
<TE>   Recommended daily levels of so-called good fats also were outlined
in the report. They include Omega-3 and Omega-6 fatty acids.</TE>
<TE>   The food industry generally was supportive, and it was expected
that certain food companies may use the findings, especially those on
adding good fats to market their products.</TE>
<TE>   Critics of Thursday's report charged that it didn't make it clear
to consumers what foods they should be eating to get proper levels of
nutrients.</TE>
<TE>   The report also failed to settle the years-old debate about the
healthiness of a high-protein diet such as the popular Atkins diet.
The panel members said they did not set a maximum daily intake for
protein because of conflicting or inadequate data on the subject.</TE>
<TE>   The report did, however, recommend a cap on sugar consumption. It
advised that sugars of the kind added to processed foods make up no
more than 25% of all calories consumed, a level much higher than
previously recommended by the USDA and much higher than many
nutritionists felt was healthy.</TE>
<TE>   "Why raise the recommendation?" said Marion Nestle, who chairs the
nutrition and food studies program at New York University. "[If
people are eating this much,] what else are they giving up?"</TE>
<TE>   Officials from the Center for Science in the Public Interest, a
consumer watchdog group, have lobbied the FDA to include added sugars
in processed foods in the Nutrition Facts label required on food
products. The FDA is still considering that request.</TE>
<TE>   But perhaps the most drastic changes in people's lifestyle will
have to come not from eating different kinds of food, but in their
activity levels. The report calls for sedentary people, such as those
working in an office, to get an hour of moderately intense activity,
such as walking at 4 mph.</TE>
<TE>   Ruth Ann Carpenter, a dietitian and exercise expert at the Cooper
Institute, a nonprofit research and preventive medicine center in
Dallas, said she is concerned that Americans will hear the latest
recommendations and dismiss them. "I'm afraid people will say 'Sixty
minutes? No way.' "</TE>
<TE>   Despite the potential obstacles, Brooks and Carpenter said
Americans can meet the one-hour exercise goal by breaking it up into
smaller segments.</TE>
<TE>   Manual labor counts as part of that requirement, as does sports
activity, walking the dog or taking the stairs instead of the
elevator at the office.</TE>
<TE>   People can also choose to engage in a higher-intensity activity
such as jogging for 20 to 30 minutes four to seven days a week.</TE>
<TE>   But nutritionists and exercise experts say you don't have to get
that much exercise to cut your risk of disease.</TE>
<TE>   Researchers at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston reported in
this week's New England Journal of Medicine that brisk walking for
2.5 hours a week cut the risk of heart disease and stroke by about a
third. In the study of 74,000 women, that level of activity reduced
risk equal to doing 2.5 weekly hours of vigorous activity, such as
jogging, swimming and playing tennis.</TE>
<TE>   "To be honest with you, any activity is better than nothing.
That's the message people need to realize," Carpenter said.</TE>
<TE>   In general, Nestle said, "eat less and move more. Anything along
that continuum is going to be helpful."</TE>

<HD>Bush's Forest Plan Seeks Waivers to Speed Logging</HD>
<DH>Congress: Proposal, citing fire safety, would exempt 10
million acres from environmental review. Critics contend public would
lose its say.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELIZABETH SHOGREN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The Bush administration on Thursday asked Congress to exempt up to 10
million acres of federal forest land from environmental reviews and
citizen appeals to speed logging and thinning projects aimed at
reducing forest fires.</LD>
<LD>   ''The Healthy Forests Initiative will reduce catastrophic wildfire
threats to communities and the environment,'' Interior Secretary Gale
A. Norton and Agriculture Secretary Ann M. Veneman said in a letter
to Congress.</LD>
<LD>   The legislative language sent to Capitol Hill on Thursday added
details to the proposal unveiled by President Bush last month.
Elements of it could come up for a vote in the Senate as early as
next week as part of the debate over a spending bill for the Interior
Department. Many Democrats are expected to oppose it, but some,
including Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), have been negotiating
with the Senate sponsors.</LD>
<TE>   Environmentalists hotly criticized the plan, saying it would force
the public out of decisions on the future of forests.</TE>
<TE>   ''The president made an attempt to sugarcoat the proposal, but
this is anything but balanced,'' said Jay Watson, California
representative of the Wilderness Society, a national environmental
organization. ''It's truly dangerous. It effectively removes the
public from having any kind of say on how the forests are managed.''</TE>
<TE>   But Mark E. Rey, the undersecretary of Agriculture with
jurisdiction over forest policy, asked that the critics stop
''howling'' and participate in the administration's effort to find a
new way to thwart fires in just 5% of the 190 million acres of
federal forests that face a high risk of burning.</TE>
<TE>   ''We ought to be able to figure out how to trust one another
without worrying about whether they can sue us,'' he said.</TE>
<TE>   Both sides agree that decades of fire suppression and selective
logging of the largest trees in the national forests have left many
stands crowded with trees of varying sizes, making them fodder for
super-hot fires.</TE>
<TE>   The Bush administration says its plan would empower the U.S.
Forest Service to thin out these trees, preventing the catastrophic
fires that have grown in frequency and scale in the last decade. But
environmentalists accuse the administration of using the issue of
fire prevention as a guise to enable timber companies to increase
their logging on public lands.</TE>
<TE>   ''This is using a real disaster facing people as a smokescreen for
the biggest handout to the timber industry that I have seen in 20
years,'' said Sen. Harry Reid (D-Nev.). ''I personally am going to do
everything that I can to stop this from going forward.''</TE>
<TE>   One of the biggest changes proposed would exempt thinning projects
in fire-prone forests from the National Environmental Protection Act,
which requires the government to review its proposed actions for
their impact on the environment. This law gives the public a chance
to comment on big timber sales and salvage projects, which remove
trees after a fire.</TE>
<TE>   Public comments "should result in better decisions that more
carefully take into account effects on wildlife and old growth and
recreation and the environment,'' said Tom Waldo, staff attorney for
Earthjustice, an Oakland-based environmental law group.</TE>
<TE>   The Bush administration proposal ''eliminates the single most
important environmental law that applies to logging projects,'' he
added.</TE>
<TE>   The law also removes the administrative appeals process that the
environmental groups, Forest Service employees and others use to
challenge timber sales that they feel violate laws or threaten
wildlife.</TE>
<TE>   Environmentalists said that these proposals would only increase
the already heated controversy over timber sales in the West, where
those who want the forests for recreation and wilderness fight those
whose livelihoods depend on timber harvests.</TE>
<TE>   ''If you're going to build consensus and bring people together,
you don't waive laws; that's guaranteed to be divisive and
polarizing,'' Watson said.</TE>
<TE>   But the proposed law would also make it harder for individuals or
groups to sue the Forest Service over a sale by requiring that suits
be filed within 60 days. In addition, it abolishes the ability to get
a court order blocking the sale while a lawsuit is decided.</TE>
<TE>   Rey said the suggested changes are intended to force resolution of
the cases ''while there is still something on the ground to be
saved.''</TE>
<TE>   As it now stands, Rey said, court cases take so long that
environmental groups know that merely filing a suit and gaining a
temporary injunction can effectively block the timber sale.</TE>
<TE>   Environmentalists also said that the broad wording of the
legislation would give the administration authority to exempt far
more than 10 million acres from these key environmental protections.</TE>
<TE>   One clause would waive environmental review for fuel reduction
projects in areas affected by disease and insect activity.</TE>
<TE>   ''Forest areas affected by insect activity--that's basically any
tree made of wood,'' said Keith Hammond of the California Wilderness
Coalition.</TE>

<HD>Hatfill's Lawyer Demands That U.S. Find Him a Job</HD>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>A lawyer for Dr. Steven J. Hatfill, called a "person of interest" in
the investigation of the anthrax attacks, demanded Thursday that
Atty. Gen. John Ashcroft find the fired researcher a new job.</LD>
<LD>   Attorney Victor Glasberg wrote in the letter that Hatfill was
fired from his job as a researcher and probably will not be able find
employment because of the Justice Department's "inappropriate
actions" in naming him a person of interest.</LD>
<LD>   "With all due respect, it is proper for you to take the lead in
setting this right immediately," Glasberg wrote.</LD>
<TE>   The letter also asked why Hatfill has been targeted by the Justice
Department and FBI.</TE>
<TE>   Louisiana State University fired Hatfill on Wednesday from his job
with the university's National Center for Biomedical Research and
Training after an e-mail from the Justice Department surfaced,
ordering the university to stop him from working on federally funded
projects.</TE>
<TE>   LSU spokesman Gene Sands said Hatfill's firing was not related to
the e-mail.</TE>

<HD>Judge Rules Retiree, 83, Was Nazi Guard</HD>
<DH>WWII: Man faces deportation after being found to have
participated in atrocities.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>A federal judge ruled that an elderly New York man participated in
Nazi atrocities in Poland during World War II and has revoked his
U.S. citizenship, according to papers made public Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   The judge said federal prosecutors proved Jack Reimer, 83, a
retired restaurant manager from Carmel, was a member of a guard unit
at a Nazi training camp that carried out the mass murders of Jewish
prisoners and the liquidation of Polish ghettos.</LD>
<LD>   In his ruling, dated Tuesday, U.S. District Judge Lawrence McKenna
set aside a 1959 order granting Reimer citizenship.</LD>
<TE>   McKenna said the government established by "clear, unequivocal and
convincing evidence" that Reimer had been a member of the guard
forces at a Nazi training camp in Trawniki, Poland, from 1941 to
1945.</TE>
<TE>   The judge said the guards were under the control of the Nazi SS
and assisted in persecuting Polish Jews, including the clearings of
Jewish ghettos, such as those of Czestochowa and Warsaw, killings,
and the guarding of labor camps.</TE>
<TE>   Specifically, the court found that Reimer provided logistical
support to personnel who eliminated the Warsaw and Czestochowa
ghettos and that he was present during the brutal operations.</TE>
<TE>   More than 56,000 Jews were deported from the Warsaw ghetto to the
Treblinka death camp and other camps, and more than 30,000 Jews were
deported from the Czestochowa ghetto to Treblinka.</TE>
<TE>   Federal prosecutors sued Reimer in 1998, alleging he lied about
his past in order to enter the United States in 1952. Prosecutors
said federal law prohibited issuing a visa to anyone who "advocated
or assisted in the persecution of any person because of race,
religion or national origin."</TE>
<TE>   The government said Reimer also lied when he applied for
citizenship in 1959.</TE>
<TE>   McKenna had delayed issuing a ruling after Reimer's 1998 trial to
allow his lawyer to go to Germany to interview an additional witness.</TE>
<TE>   Reimer's lawyer, former U.S. Atty. Gen. Ramsey Clark, could not be
reached for comment.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. Atty. for the Southern District of New York James Comey said
in a statement: "The court's decision demonstrates that people like
Reimer, who assisted the Nazi genocide, have no right to enter the
United States or to receive the privilege of U.S. citizenship....
Reimer's presence in the United States is an affront to all those
killed in the Holocaust."</TE>
<TE>   Eli Rosenbaum, director of the Justice Department's Office of
Special Investigations, said he expected Reimer would appeal the
judge's decision. If McKenna's ruling is upheld on appeal, Rosenbaum
said the government would seek Reimer's deportation.</TE>
<TE>   A hearing then would be scheduled before an immigration court in
Manhattan. Rosenbaum said he thought the earliest a hearing could
take place was next year.</TE>
<TE>   During the 1998 trial, prosecutors presented evidence that Reimer,
a Ukrainian-born German, had been a commander at the Trawniki camp
and participated in the liquidation of Jewish ghettos in Warsaw,
Lublin and Czestochowa.</TE>
<TE>   Reimer had argued he was, in essence, a prisoner of war. A former
Soviet army officer, Reimer said he was captured by the Nazis and
subject to being shot by the SS.</TE>
<TE>   McKenna said that whether Reimer's actions were voluntary was not
relevant under the law.</TE>
<TE>   He said courts had uniformly concluded that "service as an armed
guard at a forced labor or concentration camp constitutes assistance
in the Nazi program of persecution regardless of whether the
defendant himself personally injured or killed any victims."</TE>

<HD>Bush Court Nominee Is Voted Down</HD>
<DH>Senate: Panel's 10-9 party-line tally is second defeat for
the president, who calls it 'bad for the country.... And I don't
appreciate it one bit.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID G. SAVAGE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Senate Democrats rejected President Bush's choice of Texas Supreme
Court Justice Priscilla Owen for a U.S. appeals court Thursday,
calling her a conservative "judicial activist" who had regularly
sided with big business and insurance firms over injured workers and
consumers.</LD>
<LD>   The 10-9 party-line vote in the Judiciary Committee marked the
second defeat for a Bush court nominee this year. Bush reacted
angrily to the vote.</LD>
<LD>   "A handful of senators, acting out of pure politics, did not let
this good woman's name go forward," the president said in Louisville,
Ky., where he spoke at a GOP fund-raiser. It's "bad for the country.
It's bad for our bench. And I don't appreciate it one bit, and
neither do the American people."</LD>
<TE>   Despite the rejection, the committee has approved 79 of Bush's
judicial picks. They include New York Judge Reena Raggi, who was put
on the federal bench by President Reagan in 1987. Bush selected her
for the U.S. Court of Appeals in New York, and she won quick,
unanimous approval Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   But more fights loom for the bitterly divided Judiciary Committee.</TE>
<TE>   Later this month, the panel expects to hold a hearing on Miguel
Estrada, a highly regarded and staunchly conservative Washington
attorney who was chosen for the appeals court here. In October,
University of Utah Law School professor Michael McConnell is expected
to come before the committee. A scholar on religion and the
Constitution, McConnell was chosen for the appeals court in Denver.</TE>
<TE>   With Thursday's vote, Democrats--who hold the slimmest of
majorities on the committee--said they were sending a message to the
White House that conservative "activists and ideologues" would face
trouble.</TE>
<TE>   "I really hope the administration listens to this vote," Sen.
Dianne Feinstein of California said before voting against Owen's
nomination. Bush won a close election, she said, and "there is no
mandate to skew the courts."</TE>
<TE>   "Mainstream conservatives will sail through this committee," said
Sen. Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.), noting the Raggi vote. "Activists
and ideologues are going to have a more difficult voyage."</TE>
<TE>   During a daylong hearing in July, the Democrats cited a series of
rulings in which Owen, sometimes alone in dissent, voted to reverse
jury verdicts in favor of injured people, workers or consumers. They
alleged she bent the law to favor business interests.</TE>
<TE>   In the wake of the collapse of Enron Corp. and corporate
accounting scandals, Democrats said they were loath to promote what
they called a reflexively pro-business judge to the federal appeals
court.</TE>
<TE>   In March, the committee rejected the appeals court nomination of
Mississippi Judge Charles W. Pickering, a friend and ally of Senate
Minority Leader Trent Lott (R-Miss.).</TE>
<TE>   Owen's defeat was more personal for Bush and his Texas aides. Bush
political advisor Karl Rove played a key role in Owen's successful
campaign for the Texas Supreme Court in 1994, and Bush named her in
his first round of judicial selections. She was slated for the U.S.
5th Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans.</TE>
<TE>   Washington is "a tough and ugly town at times. We saw that today,"
Bush said.</TE>
<TE>   Before Thursday's vote, Republicans praised Owen as a superbly
qualified judge whose record was distorted by "Washington smear
groups" and "left-wing lobbyists."</TE>
<TE>   The American Bar Assn.'s screening committee gave Owen, 47, a
unanimous rating of well qualified.</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Orrin G. Hatch of Utah, the ranking Republican on the
Judiciary Committee, said Owen's defeat was the first time the panel
had rejected a judicial candidate who had a unanimous well-qualified
rating from the ABA. He added that Owen would have won confirmation
on the Senate floor because Georgia Sen. Zell Miller, a conservative
Democrat, said he would vote for her.</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Patrick J. Leahy (D-Vt.) interrupted to read the names of 10
of President Clinton's judicial nominees who had top ratings from the
ABA, but were blocked when Republicans controlled the panel.</TE>
<TE>   Leahy described Raggi as a conservative Republican nominee who has
proved herself as a "fair and impartial judge. In sharp contrast is
Justice Priscilla Owen, a nominee whose record is too extreme even
for the very conservative Texas Supreme Court."</TE>
<TE>   Abortion rights advocates opposed Owen because of several opinions
interpreting the Texas law that requires teenagers to notify a parent
before obtaining an abortion.</TE>
<TE>   Teenagers who are judged to be mature or fear abuse by a parent
can obtain a waiver. But in dissents, Owen refused to go along with
these waivers and said the young women should be required to consider
religious perspectives concerning abortion.</TE>
<TE>   Her detractors and supporters differed about whether her opinions
followed the law or revised it.</TE>
<TE>   The battle over Owen's nomination echoed the ideological fights
that have shaken several state supreme courts.</TE>
<TE>   In the 1990s, liberal trial lawyer and conservative corporate
interests fought for control of the Texas Supreme Court. Having once
been dominated by liberal judges, the court shifted to the right
after business-backed candidates like Owen were elected to the bench.</TE>
<TE>   "She was elected to be sympathetic to corporate interests, and she
has consistently voted in favor of industry," said Sen. Richard
Durbin (D-Ill).</TE>
<TE>   Feinstein, who chaired the July hearing, described her vote
Thursday as "the most difficult" in her time on the committee. Owen
is smart and personable, she said, and "she handled herself very well
in front of this committee."</TE>
<TE>   Nonetheless, Feinstein said she decided to vote no because Owen
had bent the law in a series of decisions to favor business or
conservative causes.</TE>
<TE>   Owen's was the third failed nomination for the same seat on the
5th Circuit Court.</TE>
<TE>   In January 1997, Judge William L. Garwood of Austin, Texas,
announced his retirement.</TE>
<TE>   Shortly afterward, Clinton nominated Jorge Rangel, a trial lawyer
from Corpus Christi, to replace him.</TE>
<TE>   But Republican senators in Texas opposed his nomination, and the
Judiciary Committee, then under GOP control, let the nomination die
without a hearing.</TE>
<TE>   Two years later, Clinton nominated El Paso attorney Enrique Morena
to the same seat, and he too was given a well-qualified rating by the
ABA. But Republicans objected, and his nomination died as well.</TE>

<HD>Senate Approves Arming Pilots</HD>
<DH>Terror: The bill passes, 87 to 6, despite concerns from the
White House and airlines. The cost of training is estimated at more
than $1 billion.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD SIMON and RICARDO ALONSO-ZALDIVAR</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The Senate on Thursday voted overwhelmingly to allow airline pilots
to carry guns in the cockpit, a controversial move designed to
strengthen the aviation security system put in place after the Sept.
11 terrorist attacks.</LD>
<LD>   With the House having passed similar legislation, the prospect
that pilots eventually will be armed appears significantly improved,
despite concerns by the Bush administration over cost, legal
liability and other issues.</LD>
<LD>   "Will someone please explain to me the logic that says we can
trust someone with a Boeing 747 in bad weather, but not with a Glock
9-millimeter?" asked Sen. Zell Miller (D-Ga.) in supporting the
amendment to homeland security legislation. It was approved 87 to 6.</LD>
<TE>   The action came as the government announced that thousands of
airline passengers flying into New York and Washington airports on
Sept. 11 will be required to stay in their seats for the last 30
minutes of flight because of increased security for the anniversary
of the terrorist attacks.</TE>
<TE>   The Senate measure allowing pilots to carry guns still must be
reconciled with the House bill. Bush has threatened to veto the
larger Senate homeland security bill drafted by the Democrats over
other concerns, but it was uncertain what the president's position
would be on the specific issue of arming pilots.</TE>
<TE>   Under the Senate measure, pilots would have to undergo training to
be permitted to carry guns aboard planes. Self-defense training also
would be offered to flight attendants. The administration estimates
that as many as 85,000 pilots could be eligible for training, though
presumably fewer would volunteer.</TE>
<TE>   Just months ago, the proposal to arm pilots faced long odds. But
pilots waged an intense lobbying campaign, portraying the air
transportation system as still vulnerable to attack and calling guns
in the cockpit "the last line of defense" against would-be hijackers.</TE>
<TE>   "Members of Congress have come to understand what the American
people have known for months--only lethal force can stop lethal
intent," said American Airlines co-pilot Al Aitken, who helped to
lobby lawmakers. "Tepid measures in response to terrorist attacks and
hijackings will not provide the kind of security the American people
want and deserve."</TE>
<TE>   Congress initially left the decision on arming pilots to the
Transportation Security Administration. In May, administration
officials came out against arming pilots, citing post-Sept. 11
security measures, such as reinforcing cockpit doors and expanding
the ranks of armed federal air marshals.</TE>
<TE>   The Air Transport Assn., which represents airlines, expressed
concerns about arming pilots, saying there are too many unanswered
questions, such as the effect of a misfired gun on pressurized
aircraft.</TE>
<TE>   "While we are spending literally billions of dollars to keep
dangerous weapons off of aircraft, the idea of intentionally
introducing thousands of deadly weapons into the system appears to be
dangerously counter-productive," said a letter to Congress signed by
21 airline chief executives.</TE>
<TE>   But lawmakers--among the most frequent fliers--drew on their own
flying experiences to cite security shortcomings.</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.), a gun-control advocate whose
support of the legislation helped give it momentum, said that
although the number of air marshals is classified, there are not
enough to put on every flight.</TE>
<TE>   "If I could stand before you and assure you that I believe the
skies are safe, I wouldn't be here supporting this bill," Boxer told
her colleagues.</TE>
<TE>   Noting that the president has directed F-16s to shoot down
commercial aircraft taken over by hijackers, Boxer added: "Imagine if
that happened and we knew we hadn't taken action at least to give our
pilots a chance."</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Ernest F. Hollings (D-S.C.), chairman of the Senate Commerce
and Transportation Committee, said arming pilots would be unnecessary
once permanent reinforcements for cockpit doors are in place by
April.</TE>
<TE>   "What you want to do is get a secure door to that cockpit," he
said. "That's the last line of defense, not a gun.... Once the door
is secure and there's any disturbance whatsoever in the cabin, they
go immediately to the ground and law enforcement meets them there."</TE>
<TE>   In the end, Hollings voted for the bill--after he won approval of
an amendment that would require pilots to lock the cockpit door.</TE>
<TE>   Training airline pilots to properly use firearms against hijackers
would cost more than $1 billion, money that the new Transportation
Security Administration does not have, the Bush administration said
in a letter to Congress on Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   TSA Director James M. Loy said a program to train pilots would
cost $900 million to set up and $250 million a year to run. "TSA's
current budget does not allow for further work in this area, which
raises the question of who will bear the cost," Loy said.</TE>
<TE>   His letter raised a host of other technical obstacles, from the
need to install special holsters for the guns in cockpits, to
potential difficulties with foreign countries that have strong
gun-control laws, to the need for a large support staff for the pilot
volunteers. "There are literally dozens of issues that would need to
be resolved as part of a program involving lethal weapons," Loy said.</TE>
<TE>   The Bush administration's layers of concerns raised the
possibility that a congressionally approved plan could get snagged in
the bureaucracy and take years to put into practice. Some
administration officials have floated the possibility of a small test
program to arm a limited number of pilots, but even that idea has yet
to be endorsed by the Transportation Department.</TE>
<TE>   The TSA is also considering a less-than-lethal alternative: arming
pilots with stun guns, which would temporarily disable attackers.
United Airlines has purchased more than 1,300 of the devices and
already has trained its pilots, anticipating approval from the
government.</TE>
<TE>   The Senate bill would shield airlines and pilots from liability
for any damages from pilots using guns in response to a threat. It
also would require cameras to be installed in planes so pilots could
monitor the passenger cabin without leaving the cockpit.</TE>
<TE>   Separately, the TSA announced that passengers flying into La
Guardia, John F. Kennedy, Newark and White Plains airports in and
around New York, and those landing at Dulles and Baltimore near
Washington will be required to remain in their seats for 30 minutes
after takeoff and before landing on Sept. 11. The measure is already
in effect for Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport.</TE>
<TE>   For New York-area airports, the seating restriction will continue
until 8 p.m. Sept. 13 because of the United Nations General Assembly
meeting taking place in the city.</TE>
<TE>   Bush plans to participate in observances in Washington, New York
and Somerset, Pa., on Sept. 11. He will address the United Nations on
Sept. 12.</TE>
<TE>   The Federal Aviation Administration also announced that aircraft
flying below 18,000 feet within a 30-nautical-mile radius of the
Sept. 11 observances will face extensive limits. Private planes, with
few exceptions, will be banned.</TE>
<TE>   No special additional restrictions were imposed on foreign
airlines. Plans to ban foreign flights in the Washington and New York
areas were hurriedly withdrawn after an outcry from the industry.</TE>

<HD>Jury Rejects Former Flight Attendant's Tobacco Claim</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>MIAMI</DL>
<LD>A jury Thursday rejected a claim against four tobacco companies by a
former flight attendant who blames her sinus problems on secondhand
smoke in aircraft cabins.</LD>
<LD>   The jury decided on-the-job exposure to smoke did not cause
Suzette Janoff's health problems. The tobacco companies had argued
that Janoff's illnesses were caused by preexisting conditions.</LD>
<LD>   Janoff, who worked for American Airlines from 1983 to 1996, and
her attorneys said they planned to file further motions with the
judge.</LD>
<TE>   The trial followed a 1997 settlement between four leading
cigarette makers and flight attendants that created a $300-million
foundation to study smoke-related illnesses. The settlement allowed
individual trials on compensatory damages, but the plaintiffs cannot
receive punitive damages.</TE>
<TE>   Three earlier trials ended with a $5.5-million verdict, a decision
favoring tobacco and a mistrial, respectively.</TE>

<HD>No Intruder Found at Utah Weapon Site</HD>
<DH>Terrorism: Someone was spotted in restricted area but fled.
The Army depot stores nerve gas.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>TOOELE, Utah</DL>
<LD>Officials at an Army depot where nerve gas and other chemical weapons
are stored found no trace of a reported intruder after a terrorist
alert was sounded Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   Col. Peter Cooper, commander of the Deseret Chemical Depot, said
the security of the facility was never at risk and that the person
didn't get close to the chemical storage area.</LD>
<LD>   "At this time we cannot confirm an intruder," Cooper said. "Right
now we are pretty sure we've cleared the depot. We're not sure if it
was an employee who was not in the right area."</LD>
<TE>   The person fled after being spotted within the heavily guarded
perimeter by four soldiers during two patrols, Cooper said. By late
afternoon, officials were still searching the grounds for the
possible intruder.</TE>
<TE>   In Washington, a senior Bush administration official speaking on
condition of anonymity said there was no evidence of theft or
terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   The apparent trespasser, dressed in dark clothing, was sighted in
a fenced area between the stored chemicals and the outer perimeter,
authorities said.</TE>
<TE>   Sheriff's deputies set up a roadblock around the depot after the
alarm sounded at 9:24 a.m. and state police used a helicopter to
search the grounds. There were no evacuations of the depot or
surrounding areas.</TE>
<TE>   The depot, about 45 miles southwest of Salt Lake City, covers
19,000 acres of mostly barren, wind-swept desert dominated by
sagebrush. Chemical weapons such as nerve and mustard gas are stored
there. It has been destroying a stockpile of deadly chemical weapons
since 1996.</TE>
<TE>   This year, the facility destroyed the largest stockpile of sarin
nerve gas in the U.S. It is to destroy 7,400 tons of other agents.</TE>

<DL>FORT WORTH</DL>
<LD>A third person was indicted Thursday in the case of a homeless man
who was hit by a car and left lodged in the windshield until he died.</LD>
<LD>   Herbert Cleveland, 24, was charged with helping dump the man's
body in Cobb Park to try to conceal the alleged hit and run.</LD>
<LD>   According to police, Chante Mallard told investigators she was
returning from a nightclub Oct. 26 when she hit Gregory Biggs.</LD>
<TE>   Police say she drove home with Biggs, 37, stuck in the windshield,
hid the car in her garage and apologized to him but didn't seek help
because she was afraid.</TE>
<TE>   Police say Biggs may have survived with medical attention.</TE>
<TE>   Mallard, 26, was indicted in April on charges of murder and
tampering with evidence.</TE>
<TE>   Cleveland was charged with tampering with or fabricating physical
evidence. Another man, Clete Jackson, 27, was indicted in July on the
same charge.</TE>

<LD>"Tens of thousands" of Americans have probably been infected by the
West Nile virus this year and the number will continue to grow
through the end of September, officials said Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   The last week of August and the first week of September are the
peak period of transmission, said Dr. Lyle Petersen of the federal
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta.</LD>
<LD>   But he cautioned that the vast majority of those infected have not
suffered any significant symptoms other than a mild flu-like illness.
Through Thursday, there have been 854 confirmed cases of severe
illness--meningitis or encephalitis--caused by the virus in 28
states, and 48 deaths.</LD>
<TE>   Although no cases have been reported in California, Los Angeles
County health officials said Thursday they are testing several
people, including one young adult woman with aseptic meningitis, a
condition sometimes linked to West Nile. Preliminary tests have shown
possible exposure to West Nile. Final results are expected next week.</TE>
<TE>   County health officials say they haven't found West Nile in
surveillance of mosquitoes, chickens, horses or dead birds in the
area. "For us, the question is not whether it's going to be in Los
Angeles, but when," said Dr. Jonathan Fielding, the county's public
health chief.</TE>
<TE>   Florida officials said the suspected West Nile infection of a
71-year-old female transplant recipient had been confirmed. That
means all four people who received organs from a Georgia accident
victim have been confirmed to be infected. Three of them were
hospitalized with encephalitis; one died as a result.</TE>
<TE>   The fact that all four organ recipients have contracted the virus
"would implicate the receipt of organs as potentially the mode of
transmission," Petersen said.</TE>
<TE>   The accident victim got blood and blood products from as many as
60 donors before she died two days after the accident. Blood samples
taken immediately after the crash showed no evidence of West Nile,
Petersen said, but a sample taken when her organs were harvested
tested positive.</TE>
<TE>   "But that does not rule out the possibility that she could have
had a mosquito-borne infection," he said. She may simply have
developed viremia, active viral replication, after being
hospitalized.</TE>
<TE>   Mississippi officials also revealed Thursday that a woman who had
received 18 units of blood during an obstetrical procedure had been
diagnosed with West Nile four weeks later.</TE>
<TE>   But Dr. Ed Thompson of the Mississippi health department noted
that the woman also reported multiple mosquito bites during the
period and that she lived in an area where the virus is endemic.
"There is as strong evidence that the virus was mosquito-borne as
there is for anything else," such as a blood transfusion, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Officials have recalled all remaining blood products from the
donors and are testing them and the donors for West Nile.</TE>
<TE>   Nonetheless, "there is absolutely no evidence at this point that
transmission by transfusion has occurred in the United States or
anywhere else," Petersen said.</TE>
<TE>   The number of confirmed cases of West Nile infection this year
represents a "massive increase" from 2001, and the increase is not
just from better reporting, he said. The growth is corroborated by
increases in the number of dead birds and by evidence of the virus in
larger numbers of trapped animals.</TE>
<TE>   The "tens of thousands" figure comes from the fact that an
estimated 150 people are actually infected for every one who develops
encephalitis or meningitis.</TE>
