<LD>It was a picture-perfect day, with a sky as blue as heaven and the
ocean a sea of diamonds.</LD>
<LD>   Snow capped the distant peaks and, nurtured by recent rains, new
fields of grass brushed the slopes of lower elevations with shades of
emerald green.</LD>
<LD>   It was a day that crackled with the effervescence of chilled
champagne. The temperature on our deck that icy Topanga morning stood
at 28 degrees. Nearby, there were traces of snow in places where
there had never been snow before.</LD>
<TE>   I have lived in Los Angeles for 30 years, but never have I
witnessed a day so perfect. L.A. wore the rich colors of winter like
Joseph's dream coat. The very air shimmered.</TE>
<TE>   I could understand as I drove out of the canyon, along the ocean
and into town what attractions had drawn the millions to this basin
of jewels. Despite today's drab suburbs, relentless traffic and
tangle of freeways, there is an exquisite elegance to our city on a
morning like this.</TE>
<TE>   Even the towers of downtown, shown in iridescent profile against a
background of snowy mountains, added depth and texture to the
adornments of this flawless day.</TE>
<TE>   The wonder of color and weather was contagious. If ever children
squealed with delight, they were squealing on this day, as snow
dusted their yards. Adults, too, the jaded grown-ups of weather-funny
L.A., were caught up in the magic.</TE>
<TE>   And as I absorbed it all, driving through the corners and the
centers of a city dressed in rainbows, I said to myself, if only....</TE>
<TE>   I had just come from church. This is a statement as unreal as if I
had said I just came down from the moon. Organized religion is a
foreign country to me. I don't believe in the ritualistic hocus-pocus
or the hypocrisy that often characterizes churches and church people.</TE>
<TE>   But I would never question your right to believe otherwise.
Whatever gets you through the night. And I have no compunctions about
being in church for special reasons.</TE>
<TE>   On this particular day, I had attended a service at a Seventh-day
Adventist church in Canoga Park to witness the baptism of a beautiful
young friend. The "dunking" was performed by the pastor, Rockne Dahl.</TE>
<TE>   It was his final day of an eight-year tenure, and in his
valediction he praised his congregation for its racial and ethnic
diversity. A gentle and amiable man, he told them that the church is
no longer "white, Anglo and Republican," but a mixture of races and
beliefs that embraces everyone.</TE>
<TE>   In that sense, he said, "The church in a special way mirrors
Southern California."</TE>
<TE>   Then he walked around the large room, its interior tinted by
diagonals of sunlight through stained-glass windows, and proved his
point. He asked members of the congregation where they were from.</TE>
<TE>   They answered: the Philippines, Haiti, Ceylon, Mexico, Guatemala,
Denmark, Switzerland, Peru, Nigeria, Tonga.</TE>
<TE>   Then this wise and thoughtful man said quietly, "Please, notice
the people."</TE>
<TE>   Dahl will move on to Lancaster to minister to a congregation much
larger than the one he has served in the Valley. But if he never
gives another sermon, his words of departure in Canoga Park ought to
be chiseled in stone.</TE>
<TE>   "Please, notice the people."</TE>
<TE>   I sat absorbed by his sermon, by the diversity of the congregation
and by the scope of the mix that is indeed Southern California. It
was on my mind as I drove through that perfect, water-colored day in
a city still trying hard to be all that it can someday be.</TE>
<TE>   We come from all over the world and bring with us special pieces
of language and culture to form a tapestry of humanity unlike
anything imagined 30 years ago. Racial or ethnic isolation is no
longer an option in a world too small for hatred. This is especially
important now as, hunkered down, we look around for the enemies who
commit murder in the name of a god who, if he exists at all, would
wither in shame at the blood spilled in his name.</TE>
<TE>   The threats brought to us by madmen are real enough, but it wasn't
a whole people or a whole religion that brought down the Twin Towers.
It was a band of misanthropes to whom power and hatred are the only
real icons.</TE>
<TE>   To those who listened carefully, Rockne Dahl was addressing the
differences that both divide and unite us. Fortifying his sermon with
quotes from the Scriptures, he was asking his congregation to
consider the hearts and souls of those who occupy our world. To glory
in the mix of colors and languages that flow through our history.</TE>
<TE>   "Carpe diem," he said. Seize the day. Be the leaders in a quest
for a mutuality of spirit that will inspire others. Meet the beauty
of perfect days with a beauty from the very core of our beings.</TE>
<TE>   "Please," he asked in endearing simplicity. "Notice the people."
Yes. Please.</TE>

<LD>Like the metamorphosis of a caterpillar to a butterfly, Holly
McComas' physical transformation was stunning. But unlike the life
cycle of the butterfly, which takes weeks, McComas' bodily change was
nearly instant.</LD>
<LD>   McComas, a 38-year-old title insurance assistant in Corona,
underwent $25,000 worth of plastic surgery a little more than a year
ago to alter her body. McComas, who had dropped from 245 to 215
pounds before surgery, had liposuction and a tummy tuck Jan. 3, 2001.
One week later, the married mother of two had breast reduction
surgery, which took her from a 44 F bra size to a 38 C.</LD>
<LD>   The combined removal of fat, breast and stomach tissue reduced
McComas, who is 5 feet 4, to a weight she hadn't been since high
school. Although McComas' body falls short of what American cultural
aesthetics dictate as an alluring weight for the female form, McComas
feels irresistibly sexy.</LD>
<TE>   "The change is beyond radical," said McComas. "The surgeries
changed me emotionally, physically and psychologically. I can stand
in the shower and look at my feet. I can wear a potato sack and feel
sexy. I went from being frumpy, fat and unattractive to taking my
clothes off and prancing around in my bra and underwear."</TE>
<TE>   Still, there have been unintended consequences. McComas' husband,
F. Lynn McComas, who paid for the surgery, cared for his wife
afterward and encourages her as she tries to lose 30 more pounds, is
ambivalent--he appreciates the results but experiences pangs of
jealousy over his wife's admirers.</TE>
<TE>   "I am only human," said McComas, an apartment manager who likened
his wife's physical transformation to a bomb exploding. "I
experienced jealousy a little bit. She is very nice to look at and
she attracts more men than she used to. She is a tease. But I know
where she is coming from," he said, acknowledging his wife's joy over
the sudden attention.</TE>
<TE>   While the mental adjustments may be more acute for the person
changing his or her physique, spouses, partners and loved ones have
their own coping to do.</TE>
<TE>   "People may have cosmetic surgery with all the best of intentions
but it may have implications that they never dreamed of," said Rita
J. Freedman, a clinical psychologist in Harrison, N.Y., and author of
the 2000 book "Body Love: Learning to Like Your Looks and Yourself."
"A person may look in the mirror and see someone who looks different
and that person has to incorporate that change internally. Loved ones
may make the adjustment in a different way. A man may not be unhappy
with the way his wife looks, but he may be unhappy with her newly
awakened sexuality."</TE>
<TE>   Not surprisingly, breast reduction surgery isn't always as popular
with the men who are the mates of the women who seek it. Of all
cosmetic surgeries, breast reductions bear some of the most positive
results for women, many of whom have been taunted about their big
breasts early in life, suffered from back and shoulder pain and been
unable to engage in certain sports, said Freedman. But women's
breasts are so associated with sexuality that a woman's decision to
undergo breast reduction surgery may not sit well with her spouse or
partner.</TE>
<TE>   "My husband was not in favor of it," said a woman who is an office
administrator in Crystal Lake, Ill. She underwent a procedure 10
years ago that reduced her breasts from a double D cup to barely a B.
"He was fine with them being huge. He tried to talk me out of it.
When I went in to have the reduction done, I hadn't settled it with
him. I did it against his wishes."</TE>
<TE>   The woman, who asked not to be identified, had vitriolic fights
with her husband, who opposed the surgery partly because he feared
something might go wrong and partly because he liked her breasts. The
woman, who had wanted the surgery since she was in her late 20s,
bought the surgery as a 40th birthday gift to herself.</TE>
<TE>   "To this day, my husband fondly remembers my large breasts," said
the woman, who added that she was "enormously pleased" with the
results. "But he never complains because he is smart."</TE>
<TE>   American men tend to be territorial about their wives' or
partners' breasts, said Freedman, who added that some men get "a
vicarious pleasure" out of other men gawking at their wives' breasts.
"Breasts are for babies," said Freedman, "but I have heard men say
[that their own nursing] baby is horning in on their territory."</TE>
<TE>   Marcia Goin, a clinical professor of psychiatry at USC's Keck
School of Medicine, co-authored a book in 1980 with her late husband,
plastic surgeon John Goin. In "Changing the Body: Psychological
Effects of Plastic Surgery," the couple followed eight women who had
breast reduction surgery.</TE>
<TE>   The sole unmarried woman in the group told her male friends of her
plans for reduction--none of them could understand why she would go
through with the surgery.</TE>
<TE>   Conversely, the married women had supportive husbands. Some of the
women took as long as six months to adjust to their smaller bust
size, while others integrated their new physique immediately The
study was too small to identify characteristics of women who adjusted
better than others, said Goin, but at least one woman discovered
after her surgery that she had used her breasts as a barrier.</TE>
<TE>   "She realized she had used her breasts, psychologically and
unconsciously, as a buffer between herself and her mother," said
Goin. "She had had a terrible relationship with her mother. When her
mother came over after the surgery, the woman asked her husband to
sit between herself and her mother. The woman realized that [without
her large breasts] she felt vulnerable with her mother."</TE>
<TE>   Goin said that cosmetic surgery, which fundamentally changes the
way one looks, as opposed to restorative procedures (such as a
face-lift--same self, just a younger version) are most likely to lead
to unexpected outcomes.</TE>
<TE>   In a study of patients who'd had surgery on their noses, Goin
said, a researcher noted that a few women who had not previously
found themselves targets of male attention experienced some distress
when they began to turn heads.</TE>
<TE>   As for Holly McComas, the most important relationship that changed
after the surgeries is the one she has with herself.</TE>
<TE>   "It is not a question of whether or not my husband likes it or
not," said McComas. "It is a question of having to deal with men
craning their necks to look at me when we go out dancing. Me? I am
walking to the bathroom and doing the happy dance all the way."</TE>

<LD>MRS. PAINE'S GARAGE</LD>
<LD>   And the Murder</LD>
<LD>   of John F. Kennedy</LD>
<TE>   By Thomas Mallon</TE>
<TE>   Pantheon</TE>
<TE>   212 pages; $22</TE>
<TE>   In the spring of 1963, Ruth Hyde Paine, a mother of two in her
early 30s in a Dallas suburb, befriended a young Russian woman
married to an American by the name of Lee Harvey Oswald. Paine, a
committed Quaker, liked helping people and, in this case, she was
also happy to have met in Marina Oswald a native speaker of Russian,
a language she was studying. Marina's husband, Lee, an unsettled,
unreliable sort, traveled a lot. Recently separated from her husband,
Michael, Paine invited a pregnant Marina and her child to share her
small house.</TE>
<TE>   Later, Paine helped Lee find a job at the Texas School Book
Depository. On Nov. 22, 1963, nine months after Paine first met the
Oswalds, all their lives would be changed--all their lives and all of
ours--by the assassination of President Kennedy.</TE>
<TE>   Thomas Mallon is fascinated by the incidental characters in
history's dramas, ordinary people suddenly thrust into the limelight.
This led him to get in touch with Paine, in whose garage, unbeknownst
to her, Lee Harvey Oswald had stored the rifle that would deliver
those fateful shots.</TE>
<TE>   Interviewing Paine in 1999, Mallon found the same candor and
helpfulness that had made this witness the darling of the Warren
Commission. In turn, the prominent part her testimony played in the
famous report made her an object of suspicion to at least some
conspiracy theorists. Mallon was not only charmed by Paine but filled
with admiration for her sheer goodness of character.</TE>
<TE>   From her Ohio girlhood on, Paine was eager to lead a life of
service. She attended Antioch College, a bastion of progressive
thinking and social awareness, which, as Mallon puts it, "met no more
than half of Ruth's moral needs." She found sustenance for her more
spiritual side in the Society of Friends, becoming a Quaker in 1951.
Although Michael, whom she married in 1957, shared many of her
convictions, his emotionally distant personality was not conducive to
the kind of passion and intimacy Paine had hoped for. The couple
split up, albeit amicably. (The Oswalds, in contrast, stuck together
even though Lee was a bad provider, an uninterested father and a
wife-beater.) Marina was the one Paine cared about. Surly Lee was
someone she tried not to offend, for Marina's sake.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, Paine's immediate reaction to the national tragedy was to
worry about how it would affect  Marina. Paine's mother-in-law wrote
her a letter warning her that her concern for Marina was getting out
of hand: "I feel you are being carried along on a kind of idealism
that is beyond common sense," she cautioned her, noting that some of
the newspaper interviews were leaving people with the mistaken
impression that Paine cared less about "the enormity of the loss of
Kennedy" than about Marina's plight.</TE>
<TE>   Taken into Secret Service custody, the widowed Marina pretty much
turned her back on Paine, even as she wrote  Marina pathetic letters
pleading for their friendship.</TE>
<TE>   Mallon succeeds admirably, not only at portraying Paine in depth
and with sympathy, but at managing to make her goodness genuinely
interesting. But line-by-line he is not a very good writer, and too
much of the book is taken up with drawing farfetched parallels, and
pointing out what Mallon believes are pointless coincidences.</TE>
<TE>   Years after the tragedy, for instance, Paine donated her old
manual typewriter to a Nicaraguan charity. Here's Mallon's riff on
that bit of trivia: "The same thrifty generosity that had once made
her send old copies of Reader's Digest to a young man in India--and
had made Alger Hiss and his Quaker wife, Priscilla, give a more
famous typewriter, the Woodstock 230009, to their maid--now assures
that, when the lights go out in the Nicaraguan capital, someone is
still using the machine on which Lee Harvey Oswald, devoted to the
same masters as Hiss, tried to hatch his next-to-last exploit." Huh?</TE>
<TE>   Despite his fascination with minutiae, however, Mallon does not
tackle the various loose ends that have kept conspiracy theorists
wondering. Indeed, his contempt for any and all conspiracy theorists
is, frankly, a little surprising. In his view, they are part of what
historian Richard Hofstadter dubbed "the paranoid style in American
politics," a style exemplified in films such as Oliver Stone's "JFK"
that take liberties with the truth yet pass for history in the minds
of uninformed audiences.</TE>
<TE>   But Mallon also recognizes the opposite problem: "If one is going
to deplore the paranoid style in American political character," he
writes, "... one also needs to contemplate the nation's transcendent
and optimistic strain, whose evasions have sometimes led it down
garden paths when night was falling."</TE>
<TE>   Mallon interviewed Michael Paine as well as Ruth, and discovered a
startling discrepancy between what Michael told the Warren Commission
and something he mentioned in a 1993 television interview: Michael
had known that Lee had a rifle, but he had somehow failed to inform
Ruth--or anyone else--of that fact. Mallon quotes Michael's reaction
to seeing a photo of Oswald, rifle in hand: "I wasn't offended by it,
but I was thinking, 'Oh, that's [got an] awfully remote chance of
having any value or purpose in our society.' I could see he wanted to
be a guerrilla, in the revolution which should come, or that's what
struck me ... and I didn't mind that."</TE>
<TE>   "[E]ven today," suggests Mallon, "one doesn't sink into the
paranoid style by concluding that, sometimes, a refusal to think the
worst of people is precisely what brings it out in them."</TE>
<TE>   Exactly what conclusions, if any, Mallon draws or would have us
draw from his fuzzy line of argument are hard to see. By the time
readers have pored over Mallon's meandering melange of the intriguing
and the inconsequential, they may well conclude that "Mrs. Paine's
Garage" turns out to be less interesting than at first glance it
promises to be.</TE>

<LD>Although the White House refuses to cough up details on Vice
President Dick Cheney's meetings with Enron, we surreptitiously
snagged the information through other channels.</LD>
<LD>   In exchange for a year's supply of Milk-Bones, we had President
Bush's dogs slip their master a drugged pretzel, then fetch us the
documents when he passed out watching football.</LD>
<LD>   From there, we pieced together this exclusive inside look at the
Enron scandal:</LD>
<TE>   * July 31, 2001: In the first sign of trouble, Enron boss Ken Lay
is warned about the company's questionable financial dealings,
including the expenditure of $2 billion on those carnival games where
you try to knock over a stack of milk bottles with a baseball. "We

<TE>   * Aug. 1, 2001: Lay promises to personally investigate and fix the
problem, but winds up losing another $750 million on the basketball
toss and the pingpong-ball-into-the-goldfish-bowl game. "They looked
so easy," he tells a colleague later. "Before I knew it, I'd gone

arrange a series of meetings with Dick Cheney. For security reasons,
the meetings take place at several of the vice president's
"undisclosed locations": inside a phone booth in Poughkeepsie, N.Y.;

<LD>Though we enjoy mild winters here in Southern California, in many
parts of the world winter looks a lot like this painting by Vincent
van Gogh, "The Parsonage Garden in the Snow (Winter)." Van Gogh was a
native of the Netherlands (a country in northern Europe), where
winters can be very cold and snowy.</LD>
<LD>   At first glance, Van Gogh's painting of a winter day might seem
bleak. The artist loaded up his brush with white paint to convey the
thickness of the snow on the ground. A lone man shovels a path
through the heavy snow. The gray sky suggests that more snow may be
on the way. The cycle will continue: Snow will coat the bare tree
branches and cover the frozen earth, and the man will come out again
to shovel as nature erases his previous efforts.</LD>
<LD>   Eventually winter will end. Snow will melt, the ground will thaw,
trees will sprout leaf buds and the growing season will begin. For
Van Gogh, the garden is a site of renewal. We can imagine that
vegetables will grow on the stalks and abundant flowers will fill the
space.</LD>
<TE>   A few years after Van Gogh painted this scene in 1885, he moved to
France. He settled in Arles, a town in the south where the climate is
very similar to ours. Throughout his career, Van Gogh loved to paint
the land and those who worked it--in chilly Netherlands and in the
sun-drenched south of France.</TE>
<TE>   If you visit the Norton Simon Museum, you can see many wonderful
Van Gogh paintings as well as the museum's lush garden, which is
never covered with snow. For more information, call (626) 449-6840 or

<AU>JEANNE MARIE LASKAS</AU>
<BD>WASHINGTON POST</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"Hello, neighbor! I haven't seen you since way before the holiday.
Thank you for the card and the picture of Anna. God bless you. I am
glad you are my neighbor. I only wish we had better relations. I know
you are busy. But is there always tomorrow? Take care. Your
neighbor."</LD>
<LD>   A note like this can only hit you with a thud. Better relations?
Are we having some sort of feud? I thought we were friends.</LD>
<LD>   She's about 90. She lives alone in the big blue house down the
road shrouded by shaggy spruce trees. When I first moved to the area,
I was told to stay away from her. I was told she might come at me
with a shotgun if I dared walk on her land.</LD>
<TE>   But when I met her about two summers ago, I discovered someone
else entirely. She welcomed me in, sat me down for lasagna and pie.
She invited me back. She took to calling me on the telephone to warn
me about weather patterns, to offer insight into the coyote problem,
to remind me to look for the blue heron in our pond; you never know
how long a blue heron will present itself for view. And so my husband
and daughter and I would visit her from time to time; we'd sit on her
porch and listen to her talk about the state of the world and her
asparagus patch and God.</TE>
<TE>   And now comes word that she's sitting there all alone worrying
about our tomorrows running out. Oh, jeez. And don't I feel awful? I
should have visited her over the holidays, and I didn't get around to
it. I should have, and I didn't. Some friend I am.</TE>
<TE>   Then again, does a friend write you a note intended to make you
feel awful? Does a friend guilt you into being her friend?</TE>
<TE>   "Let's go," I say to Alex. "We have to go visit the old lady." We
bundle Anna up in her snowsuit, head out under the bluest winter sky.
None of this feels right. I'm not making this visit on friendly
terms; no, I'm doing a chore. She's the one who turned it into a
chore. That note. Was that note really fair?</TE>
<TE>   It's tricky being friends with an old lady. It just is. Is she a
friend, or is she a project you've taken on? A note like that can
cause you to wonder.</TE>
<TE>   "Well, you're here now," she says when she opens the door. "I'm
surprised. I thought it was too cold out." She's hunched over more
than I remember, and her hair is so white it appears to be turning
yellow. She's in the same socks and aqua-blue housedress she was in
last time I saw her; in fact, I've never seen her wear anything else.</TE>
<TE>   "Anna got so big," she says. "Can I give her cookies? I made her
cookies. I love her. Do you know that? If I were young, I would go to
China tomorrow and get one just like her."</TE>
<TE>   Usually it's hard to know how to respond to her. But silence makes
things easier. It gives her the room she needs to talk. She shows us
a potted dandelion. "Did you know you could get dandelions to grow
inside?" she asks. Just a little experiment she ran. "Hey," she says
to Alex, "Could you bring me a book on Judaism sometime? I do not
have one book on Judaism in this house, can you believe that?" She
points her finger at him. "I believe in all faiths. Religion is about
the quest, not the truth."</TE>
<TE>   Anna is watching the birds in the bird feeders outside. It occurs
to me that my bird feeders have been empty for a while now. It occurs
to me that I haven't read any of the books on Judaism in our house.</TE>
<TE>   She asks us about China, about our trip next spring to go back and
adopt the baby who will become Anna's sister. "I'm praying for that
baby," she says. "I want you to know I'm praying for her every day."</TE>
<TE>   I'm surprised. And grateful. I've been keeping myself too busy to
even think about the baby, much less pray. Prayers, I think, are a
lot like bird feeders. And books waiting to be read.</TE>
<TE>   "I have something for you," she says. "I don't know if you'll
choose to accept it." She pulls herself out of her chair, shuffles
with much effort to the next room. She returns with two pillowcases
embroidered in blue and pink and yellow. "One for Anna, and one for
her sister, OK?" she says. "Of course, I didn't know that's who I was
making them for at the time."</TE>
<TE>   The time was 20 years ago, when her own daughter died in a house
fire. She tells us that she embroidered to keep herself from going
crazy, embroidered all day, every day, until her hands literally gave
out.</TE>
<TE>   We tell her we are honored to accept her gift. We head home with
two embroidered pillowcases, one for a little girl we've yet to meet.
The pillowcase, created out of a mother's tears, is her first
official present.</TE>
<TE>   We head home wondering how it happens. How can a visit that felt
so wrong turn out to be so right? It's always right, I suppose, to
answer the call of an old lady.</TE>

<HD>A Concrete Example of the Power of Art</HD>
<DH>A detention center lets its young residents transform a
wall into a forum for their dreams and emotions.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRIS L. JENKINS</AU>
<BD>WASHINGTON POST</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The wall had stood more than 30 feet high, putty-colored and dull,
dividing a large atrium at the suburban Prince William County, Va.,
Juvenile Detention Home. It did its job: separating female and male
detainees, steering them through the drab units, a sober symbol that
they've been cut off from the outside world.</LD>
<LD>   "It was just ugly," said Colleen, a 15-year-old detainee whose
last name is withheld following county policy.</LD>
<LD>   "Girls are not allowed to look on the boys' side," Colleen said,
"and boys can't even look over here .... It was one of the most
depressing things about this place."</LD>
<TE>   But what began as a simple art project six months ago has
transformed the wall into a forum for a kaleidoscope of dreams,
emotions and feelings. With the help of Kristine Roberts, who has
taught painting at the home for a year, a revolving door of young
offenders has painted murals on each side of the wall, one abstract
or realistic theme after another.</TE>
<TE>   Female detainees created a vibrant garden scene of greens,
purples, yellows and reds, with radiant butterflies and caterpillars.
On the other side, the boys painted an inner-city landscape, with
renderings of hip-hop artists and low-riders that morph into a
fantasy of waterfalls and brilliant flowers.</TE>
<TE>   The detention home provides short-term care of offenders, ages 9
to 17, apprehended for delinquency and other crimes that require
secure custody. Most youths can be held at the home as long as 30
days, pending court disposition or transfer to another jurisdiction
or agency.</TE>
<TE>   "What we're trying to do here is allow them to have their own
little bit of space, something they have created," said Roberts, 52,
who teaches at the Manassas, Va.-based Center for the Arts.
"Oftentimes, when they're at home, they don't get a chance to do
that. This exercise gives them a sense that they've contributed to
something larger."</TE>
<TE>   The murals have taken on a life of their own. They help detention
home supervisor Barbara Jones better understand her charges, and give
her a chance to work with them when their guard is down.</TE>
<TE>   Some teenagers were excited about the project from the start.
Others needed time to warm up to the exercise. Some dismiss it as a
chore, something forced on them to pass the time.</TE>
<TE>   "At first I really wasn't into it at all," said Ra'sha, 17, who is
charged with grand theft. "Painting's never been my hobby ... but
it's a good way of getting stuff off our mind and putting it on
paper."</TE>
<TE>   For years, youths had helped decorate parts of the home with
inventive paintings--a picture here, a window painted there. But
Roberts and shift supervisor Jayne Frelin wanted something that would
make a larger statement about the teenagers' potential and talent.</TE>
<TE>   "We just wanted something that would be here for a long time,"
Frelin said. "All of the other things were seasonal. We'd put them
up, then take them down."</TE>
<TE>   The murals' development wasn't always smooth. There were often
emotional disagreements about the placement and color of various
designs. Girls rallied to have one rendering of a bunny--originally
painted with fangs dripping with blood by one girl--altered because
the image disturbed them.</TE>
<TE>   "Sometimes these guys got quite angry with each other," Roberts
said. "There was a lot of ownership with what they painted, what they
thought was right and made sense."</TE>
<TE>   But it also became a communal wall for detainees working together
on a specific image. They sit and stand, lean and grope, mix and
massage the paint. They talk about how they got where they are, their
anger and frustrations, the judge who sent them here and what they
want to do when they get out.</TE>
<TE>   "It brings us together," said Mona, 15, at the home on charges of
excessive truancy. "With a lot of the other things we do in here, you
don't get a chance just to get to know some of the other girls. Here
we can just work on something together--something that's fun and
different."</TE>
<TE>   The program is funded through the same $40,000 worth of public and
private funds that help pay for art programs that the Center for the
Arts has in county group homes and alternative high schools.</TE>
<TE>   Center Director Sally Lay said a larger project is more
inspirational than a simple painting class. "It really opens up a
dialogue between the kids and everyone who sees it or has worked on
it," she said. "People are always asking: 'Why did they do it this
way? What does this mean? What does that mean?' ... I think that's
much more effective than simply sitting in classrooms."</TE>
<TE>   For Colleen, the 15-year-old, the wall is like a timeline, a
reminder that she still has a long way to go. She helped paint some
of the first designs in August, then went home. She returned in
November, on probation violation offenses stemming from charges of
car theft. She painted neon mushrooms and blades of grass then, she
said, before leaving for her grandmother's house.</TE>
<TE>   Her signature with the date is written on the side of each of her
contributions. This month, she's back on probation violation offenses
again.</TE>
<TE>   "It kind of makes me see that I keep coming back here," Colleen
said. She sighed. "I've got to straighten up."</TE>

<HD>A Broker's Poetic License</HD>
<DH>Ed Rosenthal adds meter and rhyme to the language of his
business, real estate.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LESLEE KOMAIKO</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>There are probably a few local real estate brokers who dabble in
poetry. But how many of them look to downtown real estate as their
muse? "I think there's a minority of one," says Ed Rosenthal.</LD>
<LD>   Rosenthal, an independent contractor with the firm Grubb &amp; Ellis
who has brokered mostly historic downtown properties for the last 20
years, is the self-proclaimed "broker poet." "I do introduce myself
that way to half the people I meet, even my clients," says the
56-year-old Culver City resident whose poems, with few exceptions,
follow strict structural forms such as the villanelle, sestina and
pantoum (which he taught himself, in a rigorous course of home
study).</LD>
<LD>   Rosenthal's history with poetry goes back a ways, as evidenced by
his sixth-grade report card, which he just recently unearthed. "My
teacher, Mrs. Moon, cited that I had developed an interest in
poetry," he says. Later, he says, "from the time I was a young adult,
I was always writing love sonnets, rhyme poems, stuff like that." But
it wasn't until a few years ago that he started writing about
downtown real estate, those involved in it, and the many issues
surrounding it.</LD>
<TE>   "What happened was there were some critical choices that had to be
made downtown about four or five years ago," Rosenthal says. "One
was, should downtown go telecom? I was one of the opponents to that
[so] I wrote the poem 'Pluton Zone,' an analogy to the myth of
Persephone and Pluto. I started to look at these telecom buildings as
being like hell because there was no life in them, no people in them.
I suggested the whole of 7th Street was becoming like a dead zone, a
pluton zone."</TE>
<TE>   The other choice, Rosenthal says, involved Broadway and what to do
with it. A poem titled "Exhortation to the Barons of Broadway"
followed. "It was an exhortation to urge these people to get their
act together," he says, "to clean up the facades and make Broadway a
beautiful place."</TE>
<TE>   Not all of Rosenthal's poems are what he calls "critical poetry."
There are also tributes to different characters, like Tom Gilmore,
the developer of many historic downtown properties. Perhaps his most
interesting work, however, falls under the "practical" category.
These are poems he uses in brokering deals.</TE>
<TE>   "There may be a [poetic] notice, an appeal, a request, and all of
them are practical. I use my imagination to inject some humor and
insight into the situation." Rosenthal doesn't write a poem for every
deal. Rather, he says, "they're usually when we reach an impasse or
something's gone wrong. These [poems] come easily and don't require a
lot of thought."</TE>
<TE>   A couple of years ago, for example, Rosenthal brokered five
buildings in the old bank district. He was representing the buyer and
seller. When it became clear that the potential buyer, Tom Gilmore,
needed the escrow extended, Rosenthal sat down and wrote "Poetic
Application for 30 Day Extension of Contingencies (Escrow 98-30675)"
and faxed it to the seller, Mark Farzan, who, needless to say, had
never before received a poem in his business dealings.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought it was funny," Farzan says. "And I appreciated his
feeling and that he felt compelled to write a poem about it, why we
should take his advice, which we did. I can't say because of the poem
we did what we did. People make decisions based on a lot of
intuition. But strictly from a monetary point of view, it probably
would have made sense for us to either renege from the deal or ask
for a higher price. Since then, I've seen some of his other poems. I
think he's talented."</TE>
<TE>   Gilmore is equally enthusiastic. "He's a little treasure down
here. He has found a way to express himself artistically in an arena
that really doesn't allow for that and to boot, he knows more about
real estate downtown than anyone else in the city. It's a riot. The
fact that I'm a subject is enjoyable and scary because you never know
what he's going to write."</TE>
<TE>   As for why Rosenthal doesn't just save himself some time and make
a phone call instead of composing a poem, he says, "That's too
boring. And there's a selfish element to it. I want to enjoy the
work, and the way I can enjoy it is to make it more like art, more
playful and expressive. Calling might have been more direct. But it
wouldn't have been as much fun. Also, poetry allows you to
communicate things people might not accept in a business format. Just
like in the movies, people accept things in art they might not accept
from their neighbors." Besides, he adds, "95% of the time, people
love it. They get a kick out of it. They may not agree but they enjoy
and value it."</TE>
<TE>   And the other 5%? "I did lose one client for a number of years
because he was criticized in 'Barons of Broadway,'" Rosenthal says.
"But they've come around. You can't have everybody like you a 100% of
the time."</TE>
<TE>   Rosenthal admits the broker-poet combo might not fly somewhere
other than downtown L.A. "Given the fact that there's so much
cultural diversity here, that allows me the freedom to be the way I
want to be." In addition, he says, "I typically don't work for any
faceless corporations or banks. All my deals are with individual
families or entrepreneurs. This gives me a lot of flexibility.
There's no bureaucratic form or process I have to fit into."</TE>
<TE>   To date, Rosenthal has published only three of his poems in the
Los Angeles Downtown News, and one of those he paid to have printed.
"A more ambitious person would have already had a book published with
downtown poems and pictures of buildings," he says. "But there's a
frenzy in real estate that gets kind of obsessive when you're working
on a deal. Then you need to recuperate." Besides, he says, "There's
no economic motive in the poetry. Like if I made $50 I'd be lucky. It
doesn't compare."</TE>

<HD>Against the Current</HD>
<DH>Eilean Adams contends it was her grandfather who first went
down the Colorado River via the Grand Canyon.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ANN JAPENGA</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>What good is it being the granddaughter of a great adventurer of the
West when no one believes you? That has been a dilemma for Eilean
Adams ever since sixth grade when she was asked on a test: "Who was
the first man to go down the Colorado River through the Grand
Canyon?" Adams answered: "James White," her grandfather. She flunked
the test.</LD>
<LD>   Her teacher believed, as do most Americans, that the one-armed
Civil War hero John Wesley Powell was the first white man to
challenge the mighty canyon in 1869. At the time, the Grand Canyon
was the last big chunk of unexplored territory in the West. There
were rumors that the unknown river hid Niagara-type waterfalls and
currents that would drag boats under. The first man to survive the
journey would be a hero for all time--akin to the first man on the
moon.</LD>
<LD>   Indeed, Powell is currently enjoying a resurgence of celebrity
based on his 133-year-old conquest. After surviving his canyon trip,
Powell went on to a career in Washington, directing the U.S.
Geological Survey and founding the Bureau of Ethnology, among other
achievements. But it is his descent of the Colorado that gives him
enduring appeal. There were four new books published on Powell in
2001, and at least four Powell documentaries produced in recent
years.</LD>
<TE>   But was Powell truly the conqueror of the canyon?</TE>
<TE>   Not according to Adams, now a 78-year-old retired technical writer
in Seattle. Spurred by her F in the sixth grade, she spent 40 years
researching the family story. In her new book, "Hell or High Water:
James White's Disputed Passage Through the Grand Canyon, 1867" (Utah
State University Press), she asserts that her grandfather actually
ran the river two years before Powell.</TE>
<TE>   Except, unlike Powell, he did it by accident.</TE>
<TE>   Adams' book has reawakened an old controversy down on the river,
where many boatmen double as historians. "Eilean's book is turning
heads," says Brad Dimock, a Colorado River boatman and historian.
"James White had been thoroughly dismissed. The river-running world
had just about laughed him off. But Eilean's story leaves little
doubt that White actually was the first down the Colorado."</TE>
<TE>   In 1867, the few residents of Callville, Nev., came out to watch
as a near-naked man on a log raft floated down the Colorado River.
(Callville is today submerged under the waters of Lake Mead.) The
man, James White, was bruised, scabbed, blackened and babbling.</TE>
<TE>   Once hauled ashore and revived, White said he'd been prospecting
for gold in the San Juan Mountains of Colorado. One member of his
party was killed in an Indian attack, and White and a man named
George Strole fled for their lives. Finding no overland escape route,
they used lariats to tie together three 10-foot cottonwood logs and
launched themselves on the river. Four days later, Strole was washed
off the makeshift raft and vanished in a whirlpool.</TE>
<TE>   The lone passenger strapped himself to the raft so he wouldn't
meet Strole's fate, then he bounced helplessly down the chaotic river
for what he said was 14 days. As the Callville bystanders pieced
together the story, they realized their visitor could only have come
by way of the unknown gorge, then called Big Canyon or Grand Canyon.</TE>
<TE>   The newspapers picked up White's story, and accounts that a man
had survived the canyon journey soon reached the East Coast. At
first, White's tale was accepted as fact. But after Powell's
expedition two years later, new accounts began to question White's
veracity. Among other charges, doubters said the features White
described on his passage--rapids, cliffs and distances--did not match
the observations of later explorers.</TE>
<TE>   At one point soon after his 1869 expedition, Powell told a
reporter that White's adventure was "a complete fiction." Another
White critic was Robert Brewster Stanton, the man who claimed to be
second to lead an expedition through the Grand Canyon. By the time of
White's death in 1927, his claim to being first through the Grand
Canyon was cause for smirks and jokes.</TE>
<TE>   Then in 1959, a legendary river historian Otis "Dock" Marston
contacted Eilean Adams' mother and said he wanted to tell White's
story. Marston did not believe White had made his alleged Grand
Canyon journey, but he wanted the details anyway. Adams says
Marston's visit to her mother marks the beginning of her 40-year
journey to unravel her grandfather's story. "It bothered my mother
enormously that people said he didn't do it," she says. "She was
furious."</TE>
<TE>   Although Adams had little sentimental attachment to her
grandfather (he died when she was 4), she says she, too, was offended
that he was called a liar. "I was proud of my grandfather, and I
couldn't understand why what he did didn't mean anything to anyone,"
she says. "Nobody wanted to know about it."</TE>
<TE>   She was busy working as a technical writer and raising a son at
the time, so the investigation often stalled. Adams' son, Greg,
remembers that as a boy he and his mother discussed the details of
White's story from every angle, trying to decide if he really could
have made the trip.</TE>
<TE>   "My mom was really into proving it," says Greg Adams, a San Diego
carpenter. In 1988, Adams retired because of health problems from
emphysema and turned her attention to telling her grandfather's
story. She and her late husband got to know the anatomy of the
Colorado River, exploring by Cessna, steam train, motorboat and on
foot.</TE>
<TE>   Familiarity with the country helped Adams answer detractors who
say her grandfather's recollections of the length of the journey and
the canyon's geography were not accurate. She argues that White was
in no position to be precise. He wasn't an expedition leader with
charts and sextants, he was a hysterical, half-drowned man clinging
to a log. At one point, she says, the starving prospector was reduced
to eating his rawhide knife scabbard.</TE>
<TE>   In her book, Adams analyzes every element of the who-was-first
debate, but her most convincing argument--as in most such
disputes--comes down to character and motive. Powell, Stanton and
anyone else who wanted to claim they were first, second or 100th down
the canyon had plenty of reason to discredit the bumbling prospector,
she says.</TE>
<TE>   And some Powell experts agree. In his massive new biography "A
River Running West: The Life of John Wesley Powell" (Oxford
University Press, 2001), Donald Worster says that Powell simply could
not accept that another man was first by accident.</TE>
<TE>   Edward Dolnick, author of "Down the Great Unknown: John Wesley
Powell's 1869 Journey of Discovery and Tragedy Through the Grand
Canyon" (HarperCollins, 2001), says he was not convinced by his
research that White made the big voyage. But he concedes Powell was
capable of bending facts. For instance, the explorer merged two Grand
Canyon trips, in 1869 and 1871, and wrote about them as if they were
a single trip "to make it a better story," Dolnick says. "We know
that Powell was willing to shade the record in a way that made him
look more dramatic."</TE>
<TE>   James White, on the other hand, never displayed such tendencies or
abilities. "There was no motive for him to lie about what happened to
him," Adams says. "He never showed any flair for making things up. He
didn't have the imagination to invent the river from whole cloth."</TE>
<TE>   White never capitalized on his brief fame. He married and settled
in Trinidad, Colo., where he owned a drayage business. When one of
his 10 children would beg to hear the story of his Grand Canyon
traverse, he'd tell it briefly and without embellishment.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, Eilean Adams has come to believe it was this same prosaic
sensibility that enabled her grandfather to survive his terrifying
voyage.</TE>
<TE>   "I realize, more and more, he survived because he lacked a certain
imagination," she says. "He wasn't thinking, 'Oh, my God, what is
going to happen next?' I personally would have been dead of fright
after the first rapids. But he was just extraordinarily practical
about things. So he hung on."</TE>
<TE>   Down in the canyon, where hundreds of raft-riding tourists each
summer retrace the death-defying journeys of early explorers, boatmen
will undoubtedly continue to argue for years about who was first.</TE>
<TE>   The man who's been on the river the longest, Martin Litton,
insists James White did not conquer the Grand Canyon. In his 50 years
on the Colorado, he says he has learned that an object set loose in
the river--with no motor, fins or oars to guide it--simply does not
make its way downstream. It gets hung up in an eddy, washed out on
shore or stuck in a logjam.</TE>
<TE>   "James White had no propulsion," says the 84-year-old Portola
Valley, Calif., resident. "If he was hanging onto a makeshift pile of
logs, he'd be there yet. All the evidence says no one was [through
the canyon] before Powell."</TE>
<TE>   Yet boatman Drifter Smith of Flagstaff, Ariz., gives credence to
White's claim to being first. "A lot of people have accused White of
lying, and even killing his companions," Smith says. "I think he just
got bad publicity from people who had their own agendas, including
Powell. My guess would be [White's journey] really did happen, but
we'll never know for certain."</TE>
<TE>   For Greg Adams, it doesn't matter what boatmen, schoolteachers or
anyone thinks about the family legend. "I'm not offended by what
people say, and I have never needed to prove it," he says. "I know my
great-grandfather was the first man to go down the Colorado River. I
know he did do it."</TE>

<HD>Meet Venus, Serena Williams</HD>
<DH>Part 1</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GLORIA D. MIKLOWITZ</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In September 2001, sisters Venus and Serena Williams beat all rivals
and played each other for the U.S. Open title. Venus, 21, beat
Serena, 19, to become one of the top tennis players in the world. How
did these two women, who grew up in some of the poorest parts of Los
Angeles, become tennis champs?</LD>
<LD>   Two years before Venus was born, Richard Williams, her father, was
flipping television channels when he saw the winner of a tennis match
receive a check for $35,000. Impressed with the money good players
could make, he and his wife, Oracene, decided to create a tennis
champion in their family.</LD>
<LD>   To learn how to coach his three daughters born before Venus,
Williams watched videotapes of famous tennis stars. He read tennis
magazines at the library and studied how to serve, hit forehands and
backhands, lob and volley.</LD>
<TE>   Although daughters Yelunde, Isha and Lyndrea showed talent, it
wasn't until Venus was born on June 17, 1980, and Serena on Sept. 26,
1981, that he found winners.</TE>
<TE>   The family moved to Compton, where Richard Williams became the
owner of a small company that hired out security guards. Oracene
Williams didn't want to live there, but Richard Williams said,
"Living in the ghetto, you learn that you have to be real tough--kids
from the best neighborhood don't try so hard."</TE>
<TE>   He took his youngest daughters to the public courts in Compton
when Venus was 4 1/2 and Serena 3. The courts had torn nets and
broken concrete. Tough boys tried to keep them away. Still, the girls
went almost every day. Their father tossed balls to them over the
net. They swung their rackets and missed most of the balls at first.</TE>
<TE>   Venus, particularly, loved the practice and begged to stay longer
at the courts each time. "She was starting to love it too much,"
Richard Williams said, so he took away her racket for a year. He

<HD>AIDS Drugs May Cause Other Illnesses</HD>
<DH>Research* Strokes and coronary disease are linked to
powerful protease inhibitors, some doctors suspect.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JANE E. ALLEN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The powerful drug cocktails that have enabled AIDS patients to live
longer, healthier lives are now suspected of causing heart disease in
some of the very people they've saved.</LD>
<LD>   Cardiologists and AIDS specialists across the country say they are
seeing an increasing number of patients on the drugs who have
suddenly suffered chest pain, heart attacks, strokes or who have been
found to need artery-clearing angioplasties. The problems are
occurring in men in their late 30s and 40s, decades earlier than
typically would be expected.</LD>
<LD>   Researchers are struggling to determine whether the cardiac
complications are a consequence of the medications, the inflammation
caused by chronic HIV infection or some combination of factors.</LD>
<TE>   But a few initial studies back up doctors' anecdotal reports
suggesting that the drugs, specifically protease inhibitors, may be
linked to the heart ailments. Researchers with the federal Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention, for instance, found a slight
increase in heart attacks among 3,000 HIV-positive patients on
protease inhibitors, compared with 3,000 HIV-positive patients on
other drug regimens.</TE>
<TE>   Study author Dr. Scott D. Holmberg acknowledges that heart attacks
among AIDS patients on antiviral medications "are still relatively
uncommon." But, he said, the problem is "in the early phase."</TE>
<TE>   Many doctors still don't routinely screen their AIDS patients for
heart disease, even though the subject of HIV and coronary artery
disease has become the hot topic at many AIDS conferences. And the
protease inhibitors, introduced in 1996, are relatively new.</TE>
<TE>   Dr. Gary Cohan, managing director of Pacific Oaks Medical Group in
Beverly Hills, one of the nation's largest private AIDS practices,
agreed that the problem is still in its infancy. "We're about five
years in, and we're seeing the tip of the iceberg," he said. "I think
we're going to see an epidemic of serious cardiovascular disease."</TE>
<TE>   Protease inhibitors, which interfere with the production of
proteins that the AIDS virus needs to reproduce, have been widely
regarded as miracle drugs. And they are--giving new life to patients
who thought they had no future. With some new medications, however,
side effects don't show up in clinical trials, arising only after the
drugs are in much wider use.</TE>
<TE>   Among the first protease inhibitor side effects to be identified
was lipodystrophy, a redistribution of body fat that created the
so-called buffalo hump behind the neck and big bellies in AIDS
patients. And gradually doctors began to see elevated
cholesterol--especially the so-called bad, or LDL,
cholesterol--triglycerides and prediabetic conditions, each of which
over time can be a powerful engine for heart disease.</TE>
<TE>   Although each of these conditions has been associated with other
classes of drugs that attack the deadly virus and keep it from
multiplying, the elevations most often have been associated with the
proteases. "The proteases are and were heroic drugs," said Cohan. But
"they come with a price tag attached that includes a lot of side
effects."</TE>
<TE>   The suspected link to coronary artery disease may be the most
troubling, because the outcome potentially could be fatal.</TE>
<TE>   Some AIDS specialists, knowing that protease inhibitors raise
cholesterol and promote diabetes, have put patients on other classes
of antiviral medications first, as long as the patient isn't
resistant to them, and saved the proteases for later.</TE>
<TE>   Said Cohen, "We have regimens that may sustain people for many
years before we have to use proteases."</TE>
<TE>   The CDC's Holmberg fears that reports of cardiac-related problems
may cause doctors and patients to overreact, leading them to stop
prescribing and taking the drugs. Protease inhibitors, he said, work
well and shouldn't be discarded.</TE>
<TE>   Besides, he added, new drugs may arrive before the apparent heart
and diabetes complications of protease inhibitor drugs render them
unusable.</TE>
<TE>   While debates about the possible cardiac effects of the drugs
continue, doctors agree that all HIV patients need to share their
complete family health history and have their blood tested for
cholesterol, triglycerides and blood sugar. "We need to pay more
attention to lifestyle factors that maybe in the past we haven't been
considering," said Dr. Judith Currier, associate director of UCLA's
Center for Clinical AIDS Research and Education. "We also need to
recognize that there may be reasons that the risk could be higher."
Currier is studying early plaque buildup among people on HIV therapy,
untreated people with HIV and people who are HIV-negative.</TE>
<TE>   Although many doctors who treat HIV-positive patients focus on
reducing levels of the AIDS-causing virus, Cohan said, "the doctor
has to take off his HIV blinders" and help patients reduce their
heart disease risks. That means encouraging them to follow a low-fat
diet, watch their weight, exercise regularly and give up smoking.</TE>
<TE>   Dr. Debra R. Judelson, a Beverly Hills cardiologist, has
HIV-positive patients who have had negative cardiac stress tests, yet
gone on to have heart attacks. As a result, she has become a tough
taskmaster when it comes to getting her HIV patients to lower their
other risk factors for heart disease while on the proteases.</TE>
<TE>   "I will scream at them, cajole them and bribe them to stop smoking
because I believe so passionately it makes a difference. I take the
tape measure out. They get weighed. Sometimes I pull spare change out
of my pocket and reward them," she said.</TE>
<TE>   One of those patients is Chuck Miller, a 57-year-old volunteer
facilitator for an HIV support group.</TE>
<TE>   After six months on a protease inhibitor, his cholesterol,
triglycerides and blood pressure rose. He began realizing "the odds
are I'm not going to die from HIV; it's going to be heart trouble."</TE>
<TE>   Under Judelson's guidance, he took up yoga, changed his diet and
committed to exercise with a personal trainer. He also went off his
protease inhibitor. As a result, he said, "my cholesterol has gone
from 350 to 174, my stomach is going down. I am now off insulin."</TE>
<TE>   Even with knowledge of the cardiac risks, the psychological burden
of another potentially deadly condition can be overwhelming.</TE>
<TE>   "Every once in a while, the reality of all this comes home and I
have a few teary days," said John Pinnell, a 47-year-old cardiac
technician with HIV who had to undergo an angioplasty and stent
insertion.</TE>
<TE>   "This is stuff you're supposed to be dealing with in your 60s and
70s. It happened to me at age 45." But then he reminds himself that,
when he was first diagnosed, he dropped out of a nursing program
because he didn't think he'd live long enough to finish.</TE>
<TE>   Now, he tries to look at the additional cardiac burden as just
"another scoop of mashed potatoes on my plate. The plate just got a
little more full."</TE>
<TE>   To be sure, no one is suggesting that AIDS patients stop taking
their protease inhibitors. But experts say doctors should be looking
for the warning signs of heart disease and prescribing appropriate
action--be it medication or lifestyle changes.</TE>
<TE>   "Wouldn't it be the ultimate irony and ultimate shame to save
these guys from AIDS and let them die from cardiovascular disease
because we didn't pay attention?" Cohan asked.</TE>

<LD>Jim Bloor was 41 and physically fit, with no history of heart
trouble, when he began having chest pains during a visit to Los
Angeles in 1997. Doctors initially told him he was "too young" for
cardiac problems.</LD>
<LD>   As a cardiologist performed a stress test to pin down the
symptoms, Bloor went into cardiac arrest. His heart stopped. Hospital
workers called a "code blue." Doctors revived him, and later tests
found that his blood pressure, cholesterol and triglycerides--another
type of fat in the blood--were at unhealthful levels.</LD>
<LD>   To this day, doctors aren't sure what happened, or whether the
daily cocktail of AIDS medications that he has been taking since 1996
may have played a role in stopping his heart. He had a
defibrillator--a device that shocks a heart back into beating
normally--implanted in his chest to minimize the risk of his heart's
stopping again.</LD>
<TE>   That frightening experience--and the realization that he now had
two serious illnesses to cope with--drove him to anger and
depression. He defied his doctors' advice to take better care of his
health, by smoking, drinking, eating fatty foods and occa- sionally
using recreational drugs.</TE>
<TE>   "I felt like the AIDS was enough" to deal with, says Bloor, who
subsequently developed a heart valve problem and erratic heart
rhythms.</TE>
<TE>   Over time, and with the help of counseling, Bloor turned his anger
into something constructive. He became an advocate for better cardiac
care for HIV patients like himself. He warned friends and strangers
that four of his most physically fit pals, the oldest of whom was 43,
had "gone cardiac on me--stents, bypasses, valve repairs, you name
it."</TE>
<TE>   As a contributing writer to Frontiers, a national newsmagazine for
gays and lesbians, Bloor realized he had a platform to warn others
who could be at risk.</TE>
<TE>   In August he wrote a first-person piece that warned other
HIV-positive people to pay more attention to their heart health. He
says most people don't realize that the virus--and the
medications--can have damaging effects on their hearts.</TE>
<TE>   Other HIV-positive gay men began to contact him. They, too, had
felt blindsided by chest pain, heart attacks and sudden angioplasties
to clear clogged coronary arteries. Some said they had thought they
were the only ones with such problems until they read his story.</TE>
<TE>   When a friend, John Pinnell, casually mentioned that he was having
some chest pain during a telephone call in December 2000, Bloor
called the nursing supervisor at the hospital in Santa Monica where
Pinnell worked as a cardiac technician, asking that Pinnell be
examined.</TE>
<TE>   As it turned out, Pinnell underwent an angioplasty that day and
was given a stent and prescribed many of the same heart medications
that Bloor takes.</TE>
<TE>   Cardiac problems among HIV-positive men taking protease inhibitors
should be a warning sign to anyone who views AIDS as a manageable
chronic illness and, as a result, doesn't bother to practice safe
sex. Bloor wants to convey the message that "this is what can happen
to you. We haven't cured AIDS yet."</TE>
<TE>   "If gay men read that you can have a heart attack at 40, no matter
how many times you go to the gym," he says, "then maybe they'll think
twice about their risky sexual behaviors."</TE>

<HD>Olympic Rule Puts Spotlight on Asthma and Exercise</HD>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When the 2002 Winter Olympics begin Friday, we will be hearing about
many medical marvels: There's the snowboarder with a liver
transplant, the Alpine racer who shattered his leg in a motorcycle
crash and an aerial skier who broke her back during a performance but
finished anyway.</LD>
<LD>   Yet doctors say the Games will also put a spotlight on a far more
common, and familiar, health condition--asthma. "Asthma could become
one of the big stories of these Games," said Dr. John Weiler, an
allergist at the University of Iowa who has studied Olympic athletes.</LD>
<LD>   That's because, for the first time, Olympic officials will require
athletes taking asthma medication to prove their diagnosis with lab
results and other documentation--or risk disqualification.</LD>
<TE>   Until now, officials have largely taken athletes at their word if
they claimed to be asthmatic. But because of uncertainties about
asthma drugs--some believe the inhaled drugs help enhance
performance; other experts disagree--only athletes who can prove they
suffer from the disease will be cleared to compete while dosing
themselves.</TE>
<TE>   The International Olympic Committee's Medical Commission has good
reason to suspect that some athletes falsely claim to be asthmatic:
The rate of reported asthma among U.S. Olympians has doubled from 11%
in 1980 to 22% in 2000, according to surveys of athletes. Rates among
endurance athletes, such as Nordic skiers, range as high as 40% to
50%--six to seven times the rate in the general population.</TE>
<TE>   Following the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney, Australia, Prince
Alexander de Merode, head of the IOC Medical Commission, described
the high incidence of asthma as "very bizarre" and quipped that "it
looks like the Games for the Sick."</TE>
<TE>   Yet most doctors who treat asthmatics say the increase among
Olympians is not bizarre: Asthma rates surged in the general
population during the 1980s and 1990s. Endurance athletes are at
particularly high risk, because the sheer volume of air they move
through their lungs during training exposes them to high levels of
allergens and pollutants that researchers believe trigger the
disease.</TE>
<TE>   "These athletes breathe in anywhere from 30 to 200 times more air
than non-athletes do," said Dr. Christopher Randolph, an allergist
and associate clinical professor at Yale University School of
Medicine. "With all that hyperventilation, they are also getting a
lot more of whatever's in the air, whether it's pollen or the sort of
pollution you see in the Los Angeles area. So if you're getting all
that air, and if you have an allergy, you've got a recipe for a big
problem."</TE>
<TE>   A chronic lung-tightening condition, asthma now afflicts 12
million to 15 million Americans, or about 6% of the population, up
from 3% to 4% in the 1980s. Hospitalizations due to asthma have
increased significantly in the last two decades; and deaths due to
the disease have doubled, to more than 5,000 a year, including
high-profile cases such as that of Rashidi Wheeler, the Northwestern
University football player who collapsed and died on the field last
summer. Doctors later attributed his death to exercise-induced
bronchial asthma.</TE>
<TE>   "Asthma has become epidemic, and no one really knows why," said
Dr. Susan Sprau, a pulmonologist and associate clinical professor at
UCLA School of Medicine.</TE>
<TE>   Many doctors think the Olympic committee's crackdown on asthmatics
is heavy-handed, because it casts suspicion on hundreds of athletes
with a very real medical condition, who rely on asthma inhalers to
catch their breath. On the other hand, researchers say the IOC's
requirement for disclosure of medical records may help doctors gain a
better understanding of how to manage one of the most common triggers
of asthma--exercise--which could help improve treatment for millions
worldwide.</TE>
<TE>   The new rules, said Weiler, should yield "much more solid numbers
on these athletes," and how they've handled the disease.</TE>
<TE>   That asthmatics can master grueling competitive sports is beyond
doubt. Jackie Joyner-Kersee, who won gold medals in the 1988 and 1992
Summer Olympics, suffers from chronic asthma; so does Amy Van Dyken,
the U.S. swimmer who won four gold medals in 1996.</TE>
<TE>   Yet heavy training regimens may exacerbate the condition, doctors
suspect. In sensitive individuals, for example, dry air may dehydrate
lung membranes, causing inflammation; and cool dry air in particular
could cause further strain on the air passageways. That helps explain
why asthma rates are so high in Nordic skiers, experts said. All that
cold, dry air rushing into skiers' lungs pushes otherwise healthy
people over a threshold.</TE>
<TE>   The result is an exercise-induced attack, which is familiar to any
asthma sufferer: chest tightness, wheezing, the feeling of "breathing
through a straw," as some sufferers describe it. If not treated,
these spasms may cause permanent damage over time, even in some
people whose asthma attacks are brought on only by exercise, some
researchers say.</TE>
<TE>   "What we think happens in many asthmatics is lung remodeling,"
Sprau said. "Fibers in lungs thicken, muscles get bigger, which
narrows the airways, there's more mucous secretion, all of which
causes further blockage."</TE>
<TE>   While athletes obviously manage asthma differently, there are
several rules that most follow: Drink lots of fluids; breathe through
the nose as much as possible (it helps filter impurities and warms
the air); warm up before exercise; wind down slowly. And use an
inhaler when necessary. "A couple of puffs on a bronchodilator 20
minutes before exercise to prevent a problem; and perhaps another few
puffs when the competition is over" is typical, Sprau said.</TE>
<TE>   Adhering to this regimen is especially important for those who
exercise in an environment with a lot of dirt and smog in the
air--such as Southern California. In a study released Friday, USC
researchers report that preteen and teenage athletes playing three or
more sports tripled their risk of developing asthma if they lived in
an area with high ozone concentration. Though researchers had
suspected as much, the new study provides some of the best evidence
to date that ozone contributes to the development of the disease.</TE>
<TE>   "I truly hope that the Olympic committee position doesn't put
people off taking medication if they need it," Weiler said. "I see a
lot of athletes who think they have to stop taking the drugs because
they've heard they're banned. But this is only an Olympic thing. It's
got nothing to do with NCAA or high school athletes."</TE>

<LD>Years ago I was on a hike with a pal when I suddenly felt sick and
bad-tempered. There we were at 11,000 feet, surrounded by crags, blue
skies and gorgeous carpets of lupine and paintbrush blooms ("The
Sound of Music" had nothing on this), and all I wanted to do was curl
up in a ball by a stunted tree and be left alone.</LD>
<LD>   A day or so later, still on the trail, I was again charging along
with trusty stick in hand, belting out, "Pack up your troubles in
your old kit bag--and smile! smile! smile!" (This may have been
harder on my companion than the grumpiness.) My body had done its
magical, physiological adjusting, and my mild case of "acute mountain
sickness" was gone.</LD>
<LD>   But what had my body done? And how? And why is it that people born
and bred at very high altitude can prance around with ease at levels
that make us lowlanders huff and puff if we reach for the TV remote?
After close to 20 years, I decided it was time to find out--and
called Dr. John West, editor of a journal called High Altitude
Medicine and Biology.</LD>
<TE>   A professor of medicine and physiology at UC San Diego, he's been
studying the body's response to altitude for decades. He was
recruited early in his career by famed mountaineer Edmund Hillary to
do altitude studies in the Himalayas (such as getting people to ride
stationary bikes atop a 19,000-foot glacier). Things just snowballed
from there. In the '80s, West led a research team that camped out at
21,000 feet on Mt. Everest.</TE>
<TE>   Thin air, of course, is the reason our bodies don't work as
efficiently high up. There's less air pushing down from above, so the
gases are more spread out. That means you take in less oxygen with
each breath--and your cells feel the lack, leading to such symptoms
as breathlessness, lightheadedness, headaches, difficulty sleeping
and less-than-optimal thinking powers. (Sometimes people suffer from
fluid in the lungs or--more rare and serious--a buildup of fluid in
the brain. Treatment in both cases is getting the person down from
the mountain as soon as possible.)</TE>
<TE>   But people do adjust to altitude, thanks, among other things, to
two clever sensors, one in the neck and one in the kidney. The one in
the neck--the carotid body--senses the reduced amount of oxygen in
our blood, and our breathing gets deeper and more rapid. The one in
the kidney, which doesn't have a fancy name, senses the low oxygen
too, and sends an alert message to the bone marrow: Low oxygen! More
red blood cells needed!</TE>
<TE>   And so, over time, the blood of someone living high will become
thicker with red cells, able to carry more oxygen. (This fancy trick
probably evolved for reasons that had nothing to do with
mountaineering, says West, such as helping the body fill up with the
right amount of blood if some is lost from bleeding.)</TE>
<TE>   Our magical kidneys help in another way--by sensing that our blood
is less acidic at high altitude, which may also be making us feel
sick. The organs do some chemical maneuvering to drag the pH back to
normal levels.</TE>
<TE>   People who've lived all their lives at high altitudes are already
adjusted in these ways, but, contrary to popular belief, not all
"highlanders" are full of vim and vigor, West says. Some suffer from
"chronic mountain sickness." Their blood is so full of red blood
cells that it's sticky and makes the heart work harder (and also
makes the sufferers look kind of blue from all the hemoglobin). "They
get very tired and sleepy, and sometimes they have to be treated by
removing red blood cells," West says.</TE>
<TE>   People respond and adjust to altitude in different ways: Most
sense it at 7,000 to 8,000 feet, but others can feel it at 5,000.
Genes probably play a part--for highlanders too. There's evidence
that Tibetan mountain dwellers, whose families have lived up high for
countless generations, are less prone to the sticky-blood sickness
than highlanders of the Andes, whose ancestors haven't lived in that
region for as long.</TE>
<TE>   These days, West is trying to make life easier for people who work
in high places and live in low ones--such as mine workers in Chile
and Caltech scientists who operate an observatory at 16,700 feet. At
the observatory, "they'd be swinging around and bump things and make
stupid and expensive errors," West says. The solution:
oxygen-enriched rooms that mimic a lower, more manageable altitude.</TE>
<TE>   If I'd had oxygen on my trip, maybe I wouldn't have kept that big,
aromatic bag of apricots in my tent--but then we'd never have met the
nice bear.</TE>

<LD>Would the Prince of Peace enjoy curly fries? How about toaster
pastries or spray-on cheese?</LD>
<LD>   The Gospels offer little guidance. But a family physician, Dr. Don
Colbert, makes some educated guesses in his new book, "What Would
Jesus Eat? The Ultimate Program for Eating Well, Feeling Great and
Living Longer." Combining careful reading of the Bible with 14 years
of experience treating patients (along with some common sense),
Colbert lays out the fundamentals of Jesus' diet: whole-grain bread,
fish, kosher meat, fruits and vegetables and lots of water. The book
also has a word to say about Communion wine: Drink in moderation.
"Wine can help lower your chances of cardiovascular disease and
ischemic stroke as well as aid digestion," the author asserts. At the
same time, drinking alcohol "is only mentioned in Scriptures where
Christians are not encouraged to consume excessively."</LD>
<LD>   As for those salty curly fries, the book says, "Jesus used
coriander, hyssop, mint and parsley to season his food, not salt."</LD>

<LD>Psychiatric hospitals are more crowded than they've been in years, a
new report says, raising concerns about whether they can accommodate
the growing need for mental health and addiction services. And as
more hospitals close or consolidate, reducing the number of available
beds, that puts additional pressure on those that are still open.</LD>
<LD>   Information collected by the National Assn. of Psychiatric Health
Systems indicates that hospital occupancy was up 11% from 1999 to
2000, and up 24.4% since 1996.</LD>
<LD>   However, patients aren't staying in psychiatric hospitals as long
as in years past. They averaged a 10-day stay in 2000 and 1999; back
in 1991, their stays averaged 23.1 days.</LD>
<TE>   The bigger emphasis on treating mental health and addiction
through outpatient care is reflected in higher numbers of outpatient
visits and outpatient admissions, the association reported in its
2001 annual survey. Its member hospitals each typically saw 1,223
inpatients in 2000.</TE>

<LD>The U.S. earned a dismal C on a national report card released last
week by Oral Health America, a Chicago-based advocacy group.</LD>
<LD>   Confirming many of the findings of a report released in 2000 by
the U.S. surgeon general, the report said that many children and
older Americans don't have adequate dental care. The nation lags in
prevention programs and in access to care among the poor, the elderly
and children, many of whom don't have insurance and haven't seen a
dentist in the past year.</LD>
<LD>   California's score was equally disappointing. The state received a
C overall--and failing grades in dental leadership (we are one of
only six states that don't have a state dental director) and in
prevention. Only 30% of Californians drink fluoridated water, and
fewer than 22% of children have dental sealants, which are among the
most effective ways of protecting kid's teeth against tooth decay.</LD>
<TE>   There were a couple of bright spots, however. Our mortality rates
from mouth and throat cancer are lower than national averages, we
visit dentists more often, and fewer than 14% of the elderly with
incomes above $15,000 have lost their teeth, compared with a third
nationally. Still, say the study's authors, "basic oral health is
still not a priority for policymakers."</TE>

<HD>Sites Offer More Than Just a Celebrity Name</HD>

<SE></SE>
<AU>BENEDICT CAREY</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Although medical research certainly isn't driven by celebrity, it
doesn't look the other way either.</LD>
<LD>   Big names like Elizabeth Taylor and Sharon Stone have helped raise
millions of dollars for AIDS organizations, to name just one example.
When celebs start their own foundations, the effect can be even more
powerful. On top of name recognition and money, they often bring a
strong personal commitment, having suffered from the target disease
themselves or seen family or friends suffer.</LD>
<LD>   Yet while celebrity foundations are poised to provide real
educational resources through their Web sites, which most have
established, very few do the job. Elton John's AIDS foundation is no
more than a portal to collect money, for example; the same goes for
hockey legend Mario Lemieux's site to raise money for Hodgkin's
disease research. But several celebrity sites provide more:</LD>
<TE>   * Doug Flutie Jr. Foundation for Autism</TE>
<TE>   www.dougflutiejrfoundation. org</TE>
<TE>   The 1984 Heisman Trophy winner and longtime Buffalo Bills
quarterback Doug Flutie established the autism foundation with his
wife, Laurie, after their son was diagnosed with the condition at age
3. The strength of Flutie's site is its information page, which gives
brief answers to questions such as: What is autism? What causes it?
(No one knows, but the site reassures, stating: "Children with autism
are not unruly kids who choose not to behave. Autism is not caused by
bad parenting. Furthermore, no known psychological factors in the
development of the child have been shown to cause autism.") The
foundation also provides an extensive list of autism sites, including
legal resources and book publishers. But for a site committed to
helping "less fortunate families who have children with autism,"
there is little guidance on what to do, where to go and how to assess
a child's needs.</TE>
<TE>   * Michael J. Fox Foundation for Parkinson's Research</TE>
<TE>   www.michaeljfox.org</TE>
<TE>   Best known from the TV series "Family Ties" and, later, "Spin
City," actor Michael J. Fox was diagnosed with early-onset
Parkinson's disease in 1991. He went public in 1998, committing
himself to raising money for Parkinson's research. Fox's site
includes two very useful features: a list of more than 30 links, from
research sites to a Web page with Parkinson's humor; and an extensive
glossary of terms, which cover the basics (diagnosis) and the
not-at-all basics (Lewy bodies, abnormal structures seen in dying
cells that indicate the presence of Parkinson's). The site's coverage
of research and news is sparse; by and large, it covers the projects
it funds. But the collection of basic information and links make this
a good first stop for those worried about Parkinson's disease or
those newly diagnosed.</TE>
<TE>   * Boomer Esiason Foundation</TE>
<TE>   www.esiason.org</TE>
<TE>   The former quarterback for the Cincinnati Bengals and New York
Jets started his foundation after his son, Gunnar, was diagnosed with
cystic fibrosis in 1993. And like Fox and Flutie, Esiason posts some
general health information on the disease, along with resources--not
only Internet links but newsletters, support groups and good books
for parents of kids with cystic fibrosis.</TE>
<TE>   But the general information on this site is surprisingly
technical. "CFTR protein with the delta F508 mutation is misprocessed
and is degraded prematurely before it reaches the cell membrane,"
begins one paragraph of on overview article. Many parents of CF kids
surely understand all of this; but it's heavy going for a novice.</TE>

<LD>SANTA MONICA--I arrived early, and already there was a crowd waiting
at the door. Minutes later, more than a hundred of us packed into the
basement of the Boathouse in Santa Monica, tentatively swinging our
hips to the swaying tropical rhythms.</LD>
<LD>   Our salsa teacher, Raoul Santiago, stood on the stage in wool
pants, a crisp white T-shirt and a New York Yankee cap. He was
teaching us to move our feet, hips, knees to the beat--and to smile
seductively into our partners' eyes.</LD>
<LD>   "Enjoy your partner," he called out over the recorded congas and
timbales. "Enjoy the music."</LD>
<TE>   I've climbed the StairMaster and plodded miles through the asphalt
of the urban jungle. But sometimes, as I work through my daily
exercise routine, I wonder: Does good exercise have to be painful? Or
so boring?</TE>
<TE>   Anyone who's ever done a lot of dancing knows what a great workout
it can be. And I was there as much for the exercise as the fun of
it--maybe more. Though I'm no salsa queen (I'm an advanced beginner
who can follow a good lead), a fast merengue can leave me breathless
and sweaty.</TE>
<TE>   Salsa is a variation of mambo, with its roots in Afro-Cuban and
Puerto Rican music and dancing. Merengue, a simple dance composed of
side steps, is the dance of the Dominican Republic. Cha-cha is
similar but involves triple steps (hence the term cha-cha-cha). Most
clubs play some mix of the dances.</TE>
<TE>   On this Sunday afternoon at the Boathouse there were people of
every age, race and walk of life. There were girls dressed to the
nines, in teetering pointy heels with ankle straps and slinky skirts.
There were men in old jeans and sneakers. Most people wore outfits
with a beachy feel: loose Hawaiian shirts, tank tops and clothes cool
for dancing.</TE>
<TE>   No one keeps data on how many Americans dance salsa, but the
numbers are clearly rising, says Albert Torres, a 45-year-old Puerto
Rican from New York who has organized some of the most spectacular
salsa gigs in Southern California. After long lingering in the
shadows of New York's vibrant Latin nightlife, Torres says, Los
Angeles is finally claiming a spot at the center of the salsa
universe. "L.A. is becoming the mecca, for various reasons," said
Torres, who promotes salsa at three clubs in Los Angeles, including
the Boathouse. "New York is the capital. But even New Yorkers believe
the baton is being passed to Los Angeles."</TE>
<TE>   For those primarily seeking exercise, the casual atmosphere of the
Boathouse is an advantage over chic salsa nightclubs such as the
Conga Room or the Mayan, where patrons are slick, glammed out and
hip. Assembling the proper wardrobe can make salsa an expensive
hobby.</TE>
<TE>   I wore jeans, leather boots (to protect my toes from beginning
salseros like myself) and a fitted top. Under my get-up was an
unusual accessory: a heart-rate monitor.</TE>
<TE>   The first hour was the class, which involved lots of starting and
stopping. It was difficult to really pump up my heart rate. When the
class ended, I set out to get a workout. Whatever they are like off
the dance floor, men who take up salsa tend to comport themselves in
the spirit of the dance, which requires at least the pretense of
machismo. That means that generally men ask women to dance--as well
as take the lead on the dance floor. With my mission to keep moving,
though, I had to be a little aggressive. I propped myself at the edge
of the dance floor and shot out those seductive looks I had just
learned in class. (Some salsa skills are highly transferable.)</TE>
<TE>   The music never stopped. That meant you could dance until you
dropped, or as long as you could find willing dance partners. Some
partners require more energy than others. Some are so smooth and
fluid that dancing with them feels effortless. Others are so flashy
and bold, spinning and dipping you that they leave you breathless.</TE>
<TE>   My first partner was a competent and friendly beginner like
myself. We missed a few turns and giggled awkwardly when we fell off
the beat, but my heart rate hit 135, suggesting that this was
starting to be real exercise Then I danced with Raoul, our teacher
and dancer on the competitive salsa circuit. The experience of
dancing with a great partner is, in itself, enough to make one's
heart rate shoot through the roof. He spun himself, spun me, danced
with a pole, flirted with the women around us, flirted with me. My
heart rate rocketed to 150. When the dance ended, I was panting,
lightheaded from spinning but very happy.</TE>
<TE>   Trickles of sweat dribbled down my temples. But here in the
Boathouse basement, with syncopated rhythms of the Caribbean
throbbing through your skin, sweat is not something to be concealed
but celebrated.</TE>
<TE>   Lured by the music, crowds of beachgoers lined up outside the open
windows--a collage of faces checking out the dancers.</TE>
<TE>   As my heart rate steadily climbed, my partners' moves got racier.
One partner, a guy with a pony tail and chiseled features, put on a
show for the crowd outside, spinning me, dipping me, and leading me
through moves so openly erotic I would have blushed if I'd had time
to think. I didn't.</TE>
<TE>   During breaks, (I generally danced three dances, then rested one)
I dashed for water and gulped it down like a marathoner at a roadside
stand. I checked my vital statistics. My heart rate averaged 116, and
I had burned 481 calories in two hours of dancing. My less-exciting
three-mile run round the Silver Lake reservoir burns 212 calories in
25 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   Later, I learned that the aerobic benefits of salsa are no secret.
Laura Canellias, who teaches a Cardio Salsa class on Saturday
mornings at 3rd Street Dance near the Beverly Center, takes beginning
Latin dance moves and incorporates a few athletic maneuvers--arm
circles during salsa side breaks, leg lifts in the merengue and
lunges in the cha-cha. At the Boathouse, I ran into an old friend who
confessed to a serious salsa addiction that took her out dancing
several times a week. I told her what I was doing. She was not
surprised.</TE>
<TE>   "I ran a marathon in December, and I haven't done anything but
salsa since," she said (and she looked very svelte). "I haven't
gained a pound."</TE>
<TE>   I wanted to talk more, but I was hungry and had to get fuel.</TE>

<LD>Millions of Americans suffer from an eye disease that researchers
increasingly are realizing may be preventable.</LD>
<LD>   The disease, age-related macular degeneration, is the most common
cause of vision loss in people older than 60. It currently affects at
least 6 million people in this country, causing vision impairment in
nearly a third, although the total number is expected to increase as
the population ages. Because it has been linked to sun and smoke
damage, a good pair of shades and a smoke-free lifestyle are wise
precautions.</LD>
<LD>   But what you eat also may affect your risk.</LD>
<TE>   The eyeballs are covered with a tough, white skin known as the
sclera, home to the retina--the part of the eye that collects light
and images and provides pictures of the world. Within the retina is
the macular lutea, which registers central vision.</TE>
<TE>   Macular lutea is Latin for "yellow spot," named because it is
quite literally yellow in color--its vibrant hue coming from its high
concentration of lutein and zeaxanthin, yellow pigments found in a
range of vegetables and fruits.</TE>
<TE>   When the macular lutea is damaged, a person begins to lose central
vision, resulting in only a peripheral view of the world.</TE>
<TE>   Everyday activities such as reading or driving are difficult in
the disease's early stages, and they are impossible as the condition
worsens.</TE>
<TE>   Although macular degeneration usually develops in the elderly,
researchers at the University of Wisconsin, Madison, have found that
increased exposure to sunlight in the teenage years through the late
30s increases the risk that the disease will strike people in their
40s and 50s.</TE>
<TE>   Although this makes gloomy reading, scientists are also finding
that eating more foods with lutein and zeaxanthin may offer
protection.</TE>
<TE>   The pigments are found in yellow squash, corn, tangerines and
persimmons. They are also present in spinach, kale, broccoli,
Brussels sprouts, lettuce, peas and rhubarb, although the stronger
green pigments hide their yellowness.</TE>
<TE>   Physics professor Richard Bon and his colleagues at Florida
International University recently found an 82% reduced risk of damage
in the eyes of those with higher concentrations of the pigments,
compared with those with low macular pigmentation.</TE>
<TE>   This study and others like it have led doctors and nutritionists
to believe that a low intake of lutein and zeaxanthin in the diet may
be one of several risk factors for macular degeneration.</TE>
<TE>   Now, it seems, there is an even more compelling reason to eat not
just your green, but your yellow, vegetables.</TE>

freelance journalist. Her column appears twice a month. She can be

<LD>A creosote bush in Palm Springs may be one of the oldest living
things on Earth, scientists said last week. Carbon-14 dating of wood
from the bush indicates it is at least 11,000 years old, according to
Jim Cornett, curator of natural sciences at the Palm Springs Desert
Museum. The bush is a 38-foot, straight line of genetically identical
bushes connected at the roots. Although the creosote plants normally
grow in a ring, Cornett speculated that high desert winds caused the
exposed plant to grow in the straight line.</LD>

<LD>More than three months after arriving at the Red Planet, NASA's 2001
Mars Odyssey spacecraft has settled into the right orbit and is being
readied for science work in late February. The robotic spacecraft
fired its thrusters twice last week to further trim the nearly
circular path it travels around Mars.</LD>
<LD>   On Thursday, the Martian satellite was traveling 7,607 mph as it
zipped around the planet once every two hours. It has completed more
than 584 orbits, currently at altitudes that range 239 miles to 278
miles above the surface. Odyssey will map the mineral and chemical
makeup of the surface of Mars and hunt for large deposits of water
during its mission.</LD>

<HD>What's Really in a Camel's Hump?</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Q: Do the humps on camels really hold water?</LD>
<LD>   A: No, they actually hold fat, according to howstuffworks.com. In
a healthy, well-fed camel, the hump can weigh as much as 80 pounds.
It allows the camel to survive for as long as two weeks without food
if necessary. The idea that the hump holds water comes from the fact
that camels can lose large amounts of water from their bodies without
dehydrating. A camel uses about 5 gallons of water per day, but can
lose up to 25 gallons without adverse effects. Pack camels can carry
loads of 400 pounds.</LD>

<HD>Chemicals Turn Monkey Egg Into Embryo</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Using a technique that may provide an alternative to therapeutic
cloning, researchers created a monkey embryo asexually--without the
use of sperm--to make stem cells that could then be turned into
heart, brain and other specialized tissue.</LD>
<LD>   A research team led by Dr. Michael West of Advanced Cell
Technology reported in the Feb. 1 Science that they used chemicals to
cause a monkey egg to turn into an embryo, a process called
parthenogenesis. The scientists extracted stem cells from the embryo
and made specialized cells.</LD>
<LD>   "These were fully developed cells that could have been used
medically," said West.</LD>
<TE>   West said that although the new study used only monkey eggs, it
demonstrates that it may be possible to make human embryonic stem
cells through parthenogenesis.</TE>
<TE>   Other experts, however, said such a technique would have a medical
application limited only to women of reproductive age and would not
benefit males because embryos produced by parthenogenesis can only be
female.</TE>

<HD>T. rex Could Hit 19 MPH, British Scientists Say</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>They were huge, lumbering and certainly not the most graceful of
creatures, but when they had to, dinosaurs sure could run, according
to British scientists. Using prints from a fossilized dinosaur track
in a quarry from southern England, a team from the University of
Cambridge calculated that bipedal theropod dinosaurs such as
Tyrannosaurus rex could run at speeds of up to 19 mph.</LD>
<LD>   The tracks show the dinosaur from the Middle Jurassic period 163
million years ago used different hind-limb movements for walking and
running, the researchers reported in the Jan. 31 Nature. Calculations
indicate the lumbering beast walked pigeon-toed with wide steps at
about 4 mph but could break into a 19-mph run by splaying its toes
and putting one foot directly in front of the other.</LD>

<HD>The Physics of Football</HD>
<DH>The science of the forward pass is uncovered, as an
aerospace engineer demonstrates the three forces that act on the ball
and give it a curved flight path.</DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>You see it often in football games. The quarterback throws a long
pass down the sideline. The wide receiver catches the ball, but is a
step or two out of bounds and the pass is incomplete.</LD>
<LD>   A misjudgment by the quarterback? In part, yes. But another
important factor is the tendency of a long pass to curve two or three
yards or more near the end of its flight, says aerospace engineer
William J. Rae of the State University of New York at Buffalo.</LD>
<LD>   A few quarterbacks seem to be intuitively aware of the ball's
tendency to veer off-direction at the end, but most aren't.</LD>
<TE>   "I talked to [ex-Packer] Bart Starr and [ex-Cowboy] Roger
Staubach, and they did not know anything about it," Rae said.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, Rae himself did not know about it until recently.
Preliminary studies he did four years ago seemed to indicate that the
ball flew straight and true to its target. It was only when he
recently performed wind tunnel testing of the ball that he detected
the presence of a curvature in its path.</TE>
<TE>   "It is not unlike the curve on a baseball," he said, "but it goes
the other way." A long pass by a right-handed quarterback curves to
the right.</TE>
<TE>   One thrown by a lefty curves to the left. The curvature arises
from a complex interaction of forces that is only now beginning to be
understood.</TE>
<TE>   Despite Americans' fascination with the Sunday afternoon sport,
there have been virtually no studies of the forces acting on a
football.</TE>
<TE>   "There has been lots of work done on baseballs, golf balls and
tennis balls, but I don't know of anybody else but Bill" who has
studied footballs, said aeronautical engineer Jani Pallis of Cislunar
Aerospace Inc. in San Francisco, a company that specializes in
aerodynamics for sports.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a difficult ball to study, much more so than round balls,
because of the wobble," she said. "It's a difficult problem to make
it spin in a manner that resembles how it is thrown."</TE>
<TE>   Rae got interested in footballs because he teaches a course in
aircraft flight dynamics. "I thought I could capture their attention
if I brought in a football and told them how it flew."</TE>
<TE>   But when he started searching the literature, he was amazed to
find almost nothing about football physics.</TE>
<TE>   "It turns out the flight of a football is almost as complicated as
the flight of an airplane, but we knew much less about the football,"
he said.</TE>
<TE>   With a small amount of funding from Wilson Sporting Goods, Rae
began with computer simulations of a football's flight. To inject
some real-world data into the calculations, he performed detailed
frame-by-frame analyses of Staubach's famous "Hail Mary" pass in the
1976 Dallas Cowboys-New York Giants playoff game.</TE>
<TE>   To do the analysis correctly, he obtained architects' drawings of
Giants Stadium in East Rutherford, N.J., to accurately discern the
geometry of the field and to account for where the camera operator
probably was standing during filming.</TE>
<TE>   "The film gave me information on the time of flight, the distance
the ball traveled and the spin-to-wobble ratio," Rae said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Even Good Passes Wobble</TE>
<TE>   A football, when thrown properly, spins on its axis--an imaginary
line drawn through the two tips--and also wobbles, the nose rotating
around the line of flight. Rae found that the ball spins nine times
for every five times it wobbles, a ratio that holds pretty constant
no matter how the pass is thrown.</TE>
<TE>   He also took a quarterback at the university into a gymnasium and
had him throw passes directly at a camera at the other end of the
floor.</TE>
<TE>   Tracing the flight of the ball in those pictures, it is easy to
see that it curves a couple of yards at the end.</TE>
<TE>   That fact was long known to the military.</TE>
<TE>   "People who launch [artillery] shells call it drift, and allow for
it," Rae said. "It's common to any spinning missile on a highly
arched trajectory."</TE>
<TE>   But it was not thought to happen with a football.</TE>
<TE>   The clinching evidence came in wind tunnel tests.</TE>
<TE>   "Nobody else has done it yet. It's not an easy experiment to do,"
Rae said.</TE>
<TE>   To put a football on a mount "and spin the ball at 600 revolutions
per minute and not have it fall off is difficult," he added.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Gyroscope Principle</TE>
<TE>   To do it, Rae took a regulation NFL ball, cut the back end off
about an inch from the tip, and filled it with a polyurethane foam
that inflated the ball to normal size without adding much weight. He
then hollowed the ball out, leaving just enough foam to keep it
inflated, and inserted a small electric motor to spin the ball.</TE>
<TE>   The physics he observed is complicated and is presented in two
soon-to-be-published papers. In layman's terms, however, there are
three primary forces acting on the football. The first is a lift
force generated by air colliding with the underside of the ball, near
the nose.</TE>
<TE>   That force tends to make the ball tumble end over end. To counter
it, the quarterback puts spin on the ball, which makes the ball act
like a gyroscope.</TE>
<TE>   That prevents the nose from rising, but tends to make it move to
the right for a right-handed quarterback or to the left for a
left-hander.</TE>
<TE>   "This is the fundamental gyroscope principle: If a body is spun
about one axis and torqued [turned] about a second axis, it will
respond by turning about the third axis," he said. "Anyone who has
ever used a leaf blower can feel this when they try to turn it."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Gravity's Pull</TE>
<TE>   A third torque is generated by the fact that the ball is being
rotated forward by gravity. Typically, its nose is pointed upwards at
about 30 degrees when it is thrown, and rotates so that the nose is
pointed 30 degrees down when it is caught. That force tends to turn
it to the left (for a right-handed quarterback) and was once thought
to cancel out the rightward torque, making the ball fly straight.</TE>
<TE>   Rae's new studies show, however, that the left torque is small and
that the ball's flight does, indeed, curve.</TE>
<TE>   Will the new findings affect the sport? Probably not, Rae
concedes.</TE>
<TE>   "But in a sport where outcomes are decided by inches, who knows?"</TE>

<HD>Playing Around, in All Seriousness, With Light</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>K.C. Cole</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>I like browsing in those corners of science that lend themselves to
serious play. OK, even outright silliness. Especially when those same
phenomena turn out to have practical--even exotic--purposes.</LD>
<LD>   That is certainly true of polarization--something familiar to
anyone who has ever squinted into sunlight glaring off water, or
tried to stop the glare with Polaroid glasses.</LD>
<LD>   With ordinary Polaroid sunglasses, in fact, you can reveal hidden
rainbows in the stressed plastic of airplane windows, turn clear
cellophane into a brightly colored kaleidoscope and even--as I
discovered one day--"turn off" a friend.</LD>
<TE>   At the same time, polarization is all the rage these days among
cosmologists studying the Big Bang. It even sheds precision light on
certain oddities of subatomic particles.</TE>
<TE>   Nature at her multi-tasking best.</TE>
<TE>   Polarized light is light that has been, in effect, filtered so
that it vibrates in a single plane. Light travels as a wave that
vibrates at right angles to the direction of travel: If it's coming
at you, it will vibrate up and down, side to side, and at all angles
in between. Polarized light, however, vibrates only up and down or
side to side.</TE>
<TE>   Think of it as trying to shake hands through prison bars: The
vertical bars "polarize" a handshake so that you can shake only up
and down. Horizontal bars, conversely, would allow you to shake only
side to side. And two sets of crossed bars allow no motion at all.</TE>
<TE>   In this sense, horizontally and vertically polarized light are
literally polar opposites--like right-wing (or left-wing) ideologues.
Crossed polarizers let no light (or productive discussion) through.
Polaroid filters are like prison bars for light--except the bars are
long, stretched molecules.</TE>
<TE>   Normally, only part of light is polarized, and since human eyes
can't tell horizontally vibrating light from its vertical
counterpart, the polarization remains a kind of secret signal until
something comes along to decode it.</TE>
<TE>   Take those sunglasses. Reflections are naturally polarized. As
sunlight hits water, for example, horizontally vibrating light skids
off the surface at you like a skipped stone, while vertically
vibrating light gets absorbed. Polaroid sunglasses sit on your nose
like prison bars, shutting out the horizontally vibrating light--the
glare. You can still see because all the other light in the sky
vibrates this way and that, so plenty gets through.</TE>
<TE>   In the same way, vertical surfaces polarize reflected light
vertically. So if you catch a reflection of a friend in a vertical
window (or any shiny surface), you can simply turn those sunglasses
on their side and, presto, the friend is gone (or at least, her
reflection).</TE>
<TE>   To see colors, you need two polarizers at right angles (popping
one lens out of the sunglasses and flipping it 90 degrees should do
fine). Crinkle up a bit of cellophane in between the two lenses, and
you should see shards of color where before there was dark.</TE>
<TE>   The colors appear because cellophane twists the plane of
polarization, so some light can sneak through even these crossed
"bars." Each color, however, gets rotated through a slightly
different angle. The result is that the cellophane spreads white
light into a spectrum, same as a prism. The crinkles in the
cellophane produce the stained-glass effect, each surface twisting
the light in a different direction--another facet of your gem.</TE>
<TE>   Not all is fun and games. Polarized light is a navigational beacon
for bees, which can distinguish planes of polarization even without
sunglasses. (Sunlight scattered off air is polarized most strongly at
90 degrees from the sun's rays.) And a physicist friend once figured
out how to use polarization in wartime to send coded messages from a
light atop a hospital. The signals were encoded in the polarization
pattern, so even though they were in plain view, the enemy couldn't
read them.</TE>
<TE>   (I'd tell you who it was, but it's secret.)</TE>
<TE>   As for the universe at large, astronomers recently used
polarization patterns to "see" that at least some exploding stars
don't blow up in neat, symmetrical spheres as many had thought, but
rather in elongated shapes--like exploding cigars--as if something
was pushing them off center.</TE>
<TE>   And it turns out that a tiny portion of the radiation sloshing
about in the very early universe may have gotten polarized by ripples
in space-time spreading out from the Big Bang. If astronomers can
decode these faint signals, they'll be able to see beyond even the
veil of the Big Bang's afterglow to mere seconds after the universe
was born.</TE>
<TE>   There's much more: Spinning subatomic particles can be polarized,
too, allowing physicists to more cleanly probe the innards of atoms.
And you can use those crossed polarized filters to find colors in
clear Karo syrup.</TE>
<TE>   So it's just as I said. Science and play. Not poles apart.</TE>

<KH>EXERCISE / Beyond the Mainstream</KH>
<HD>Tai Chi May Pay Off in Unconventional Ways</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BARRIE R. CASSILETH</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>I was surprised when I saw a sign announcing tai chi classes on a
grassy town square in Truro, a tiny burg of barely 1,800 residents
near the tip of Cape Cod. Tai chi in little Truro? The ancient
exercise regimen, it seems, has finally come of age in this country.</LD>
<LD>   Tai chi is one of several closely related exercises that include
qigong and related martial arts like kung fu, taekwando, judo, karate
and jiujitsu. Although some are aggressive--and others, like tai chi
and qigong, more passive-- they all have a common philosophy
prevalent throughout Chinese medicine.</LD>
<LD>   That is the fundamental belief that illness results from an
imbalance of internal opposite and complementary universal forces
called yin and yang, and that "chi" (sometimes spelled qi or ch'i) is
a vital energy or life force that flows through the body. When chi is
in balance--not too much, not too little flow of energy--we have good
health.</LD>
<TE>   Even though these ideas are thousands of years old, modern medical
science has found value in some of the activities they produced.
We've learned that tai chi is a valuable gentle exercise,
particularly for older folks. There have been three major studies
reported in respected U.S. medical journals showing that tai chi can
improve physical balance, reduce the risk of falls and decrease the
incidence of hip fractures. This exercise regimen also can help lower
heart rate and blood pressure.</TE>
<TE>   Tai chi expresses motions according to the yin and yang of ancient
Chinese philosophy. Movements are usually conducted in pairs of
opposites to achieve balance and harmony.</TE>
<TE>   A turning movement to the right, for example, may begin with a
slight move to the left. It is not difficult to see some relationship
to the more aggressive martial arts in tai chi movements. Some steps,
in fact, originally were designed to absorb the energy of an
opponent's attack, or to turn the attacker's energy back upon him.</TE>
<TE>   Tai chi, though, is more than the gentle movement of arms and legs
that we've seen in photographs of elderly Chinese practicing in the
early morning in parks or plazas. Proper breathing and meditation are
essential. One must breathe from the diaphragm, concentrating on a
point just below the navel. This point is considered to be the center
of chi--the core of life energy.</TE>
<TE>   One cannot simply begin practicing tai chi and expect therapeutic
benefit. Properly executed tai chi requires months of training and
practice. The regimen consists of specific movements that are
completed in forms. Each form consists of 20 to 100 different but
related motions, practiced at a slow, deliberate pace.</TE>
<TE>   The philosophical and spiritual constructs on which tai chi is
based have remained unchanged over the millennia. They are reported
in the Tao Te Ching, a book written in the 6th century BC. It
describes the components of Taoism, an ideology that outlines some of
the most fundamental concepts of ancient Chinese wisdom.</TE>
<TE>   Every form has a descriptive name, often based on nature: "Wave
Hands Like Clouds" or "Grasping the Bird's Tail." And the movements
are, in fact, based on those of trees, clouds, animals and other of
nature's expressions. After learning basic forms, tai chi students
progress to a "push hands" exercise, working with a partner. Partners
stand face to face, extending their arms in constant contact with one
other and following a prescribed series of movements. In the advanced
form, each person tries to upset his or her partner's balance without
losing contact.</TE>
<TE>   Should you try tai chi? If you take it seriously, you almost
certainly will benefit. Older people may well find that arthritis
pain is reduced and cardiovascular fitness improved. It helps reduce
stress for many of all ages. It can increase muscle strength and
balance generally, and improve overall functional status.</TE>
<TE>   You can buy tai chi books and tapes to learn more about this
unique exercise. For maximum benefit, it is best to learn from a
properly trained tai chi instructor. One information source is the
nonprofit Taoist Tai Chi Society of America, headquartered in
Florida. There is also an international Tai Chi magazine. There are
related listings in dozens of California communities. To find an
instructor or class near you, check your local health club or phone
book business pages, or search the Internet.</TE>

<HD>Finding the Correct Number of Calories to Shed Pounds</HD>
<DH>Weight* People are notoriously bad at overestimating or
(more likely) underestimating calorie intake. But there are tools to
help with that.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SALLY SQUIRES</AU>
<BD>WASHINGTON POST</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>How many calories do you need to eat each day? That's a key question
if you're trying to instill healthier habits and hold the line on
weight gain.</LD>
<LD>   It all comes down to numbers--calories in, calories out--and
finding the right balance to maintain your weight. Tip it too much
toward intake and the pounds will pile on, but tilt it the other way,
even slightly, and it's just a matter of time before unneeded pounds
drop off.</LD>
<LD>   The trick, of course, is figuring out how many calories are
enough, which requires estimating resting metabolic rate--the number
of calories required just to stay alive.</LD>
<TE>   About 20% of the resting metabolic rate is accounted for by the
brain and nervous system. The liver gobbles up about 32%, while the
heart and lungs each take about 10% of total calories. The rest goes
to the kidneys (7%) and other tissues in the body (21%.)</TE>
<TE>   Resting metabolic rate varies from person to person. It declines
with age but generally runs a little higher in men because of greater
muscle mass, which burns more calories than does fat. That means a
160-pound man gets to eat a few more calories daily than a 160-pound
woman.</TE>
<TE>   Resting metabolic rate can be measured down to the calorie with
sophisticated and costly medical equipment. Cheaper, hand-held
devices streamline measurement and are used as marketing tools by
health clubs. But for the vast majority of folks, the rate is easily
estimated with a few simple calculations or by using an online
calculator designed to measure resting metabolic rate
(www.dallasdieti tian.com/calcalc.htm).</TE>
<TE>   To do the math yourself: Take body weight in pounds and multiply
by 10. Then add about 20% to 40% more calories for a sedentary
lifestyle; 40% to 60% for a more-active daily life, and 60% to 80%
for a highly active lifestyle. (Thus, a 120-pound moderately active
person needs to eat about 1,680 calories--1,200 plus about 480
calories for activity--to maintain his or her weight, while a
sedentary 150-pound person would need to consume about 1,800 calories
daily--1,500 calories plus 300--to keep the bathroom scale steady.)</TE>
<TE>   Even easier: Use the U.S. Dietary Guidelines, which recommend
1,600 calories a day for children, women and older adults; 2,200 a
day for older children, teen girls, active women and most men and
2,800 a day for adolescent boys and active men.</TE>
<TE>   Not surprisingly, weight loss is a different story and requires
trimming calories below those required to maintain weight. One pound
is equal to about 3,500 calories. Spread that over a week, and it
works out to a deficit of about 500 calories a day--an amount that
many weight-loss experts recommend achieving by cutting back on food
(about 250 calories) and exercising a little more (to burn about 250
calories daily). If you do this, you'll lose about a pound a week.
Cut just 250 calories a day (125 in food, 125 in exercise) and lose
approximately half a pound a week.</TE>
<TE>   Or take a lesson from Thomas Wadden, director of the Weight and
Eating Disorders Clinic at the University of Pennsylvania. For weight
loss, he recommends eating 1,200 to 1,500 calories a day for women
and 1,500 to 1,800 calories a day for men.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, reducing calories almost certainly means counting them.
Yet, studies show that people are notoriously bad at accurately
tracking calories, a failing that gets worse with increasing body
mass index. In other words, lean people "underestimate their daily
calories by about 20%, while overweight people underestimate their
calories by about 40%," Wadden says.</TE>
<TE>   To assign calorie totals to your food intake, there are several
good sources. The University of Pennsylvania uses "The Doctor's
Pocket Calorie, Fat &amp; Carbohydrate Counter 2002 Edition," available
in print or online at www.calorieking. com. The Interactive Healthy
Eating Index, on the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Web site at
www.usda.gov/cnpp/, will calculate and save data on up to 20 days of
meals. The "cyberkitchen" at www.shapeup.org will calculate food and
activity; calorie counters for hand-held computers are available at
www.palmblvd.com and www.healthetech.com.</TE>
<TE>   You can also figure out how many calories you burn by logging on
to www.caloriesperhour.com or calculating your activity level  at
www.shapeup.org/fitness/assess/ fset2.htm.</TE>
<TE>   By keeping a close eye on your calorie intake, you'll find you're
coming closer to a healthy diet--and lifestyle.</TE>

<HD>Genetic Test Could Eliminate Colon Cancer Procedure</HD>

<LD>A new genetic test could eventually eliminate invasive and cumbersome
colonoscopies for detecting colorectal cancer, Baltimore researchers
say, but it will be three to five years before the test is ready for
general use.</LD>
<LD>   Early detection of colon cancer could prevent most of the 56,000
deaths it now causes each year, but many people are unwilling to
undergo the daylong fasting, intestinal flushing and invasive
colonoscopies necessary to find early tumors. The new test requires
no changes in diet and no cleansing of the gastrointestinal system.</LD>
<LD>   The test looks for mutations in a gene called APC, which stands
for adenomatous polyposis coli. Research by Dr. Bert Vogelstein and
his colleagues at the Kimmel Cancer Center at Johns Hopkins
University has shown that the APC gene is mutated in nearly all
colorectal tumors. The new test relies on the fact that cells from a
tumor are sloughed off into stool, where they can be detected. But it
requires great technical sophistication to find the mutated gene
because it is present in fewer than one in every 100 APC genes found
in stool.</LD>
<TE>   Vogelstein and his colleagues performed the test on stool samples
from 46 patients with malignant or premalignant tumors and 28 healthy
people. They reported in Thursday's New England Journal of Medicine
that the test was positive in 57% of the tumor patients but in none
of the healthy controls. The team hopes to improve the test so that
it detects at least 70% of tumors. The cost of the test is expected
to be about $500. The study was partially funded by Exact Sciences
Corp. of Maynard, Mass., which plans to market the test.</TE>

<TE>   Study Backs Daily Tests for Kidney Failure Patients</TE>
<TE>   Daily hemodialysis is more effective than the currently used
alternate-day blood cleansing for hospitalized patients with acute
kidney failure, according to a new study.</TE>
<TE>   Dr. Helmut Schiffl and his colleagues at the University of Munich
in Germany studied 160 patients with acute kidney failure over a
five-year period. Half were given daily dialysis, half alternate-day
dialysis. The team reported in today's New England Journal of
Medicine that 46% of the patients getting alternate-day dialysis
died, compared with just 28% of those receiving daily dialysis.
Typically, the symptoms of kidney failure disappeared within nine
days in those receiving daily dialysis compared with 16 days for
those in the other regimen.</TE>
<TE>   The daily regimen dramatically improves the chances of survival
and speeds recovery of the kidney, the team concluded.</TE>

<TE>   Two Steps Better Than One in Cleaning Lenses</TE>
<TE>   One-step contact lens solutions are not as effective as two-step
systems in killing all forms of the bacterium Acanthamoeba, a main
cause of eye infections in contact lens wearers.</TE>
<TE>   Dr. Horst Aspock and his colleagues at the Clinical Institute of
Hygiene in Vienna compared a one-step hydrogen peroxide solution, a
one-step polyhexamethylene biguanide solution and a two-step hydrogen
peroxide solution against Acanthamoeba. They reported in this month's
British Journal of Ophthalmology that only the two-step disinfectant
solution successfully killed all the Acan- thamoeba when used as di-
rected.</TE>
<TE>   Because peroxide is harmful to the eye, such solutions must be
neutralized before the lenses can be worn. One-step peroxide systems
typically use a metal catalyst placed in the lens cup with the
disinfecting solution to slowly destroy the peroxide.</TE>
<TE>   In two-step peroxide systems, the lenses are immersed for 10
minutes in a second solution containing an enzyme that destroys the
peroxide. Other one-step solutions use a detergent to inactivate
bacteria.</TE>
<TE>   The researchers speculated that the neutralizing disks in the
one-step solutions destroyed the hydrogen peroxide before it had a
chance to completely eradicate the bacteria. The detergent-based
solutions are apparently simply not powerful enough to destroy all
forms of Acanthamoeba.</TE>

<TE>   Regular Exercise Benefits Elasticity of Arteries</TE>
<TE>   Your arteries are much less likely to stiffen as you age, thereby
increasing blood pressure, if you exercise regularly, according to
researchers at the University of Pittsburgh.</TE>
<TE>   Retaining elasticity in the arteries does not necessarily require
a regular exercise program, however. Regular physical activities such
as moving around the house, dancing or yardwork may be sufficient.</TE>
<TE>   Dr. Rachel Mackey and her colleagues studied 356 men and women
ages 70 to 96. They questioned the subjects about the extent of their
physical activity, then measured the stiffness of their arteries with
a technique called pulse wave velocity.</TE>
<TE>   The team reported in the January issue of the American Journal of
Hypertension that the more exercise the patients reported, the
greater the elasticity of their arteries, independent of other risk
factors for heart disease. Among women, the team found that current
and former users of hormone replacement therapy had more elastic
arteries than those who had never used it.</TE>
<TE>   The importance of hormone replacement therapy for maintaining
blood vessel health was noted independently by UCLA researchers who
measured blood flow to the heart at rest and in times of stress in
post-menopausal women.</TE>
<TE>   Dr. Heinz Schelbert and his colleagues studied 54 post-menopausal
women--31 of whom were taking hormone replacement therapy--and 12
young healthy women who served as controls.</TE>
<TE>   The team reported in Tuesday's issue of Circulation: Journal of
the American Heart Assn. that the women who were not receiving
hormone replacement therapy had impaired blood flow to the heart
during stress. Women receiving the therapy, however, had blood flow
equivalent to that of the younger women--unless they had other risk
factors for heart disease, such as high cholesterol.</TE>

<LD>Question: I'm thinking about buying a rowing machine for my cardio
workouts at home. Or is the elliptical machine a better workout?</LD>
<LD>   CRAIG NEWLAND</LD>
<LD>   Wakefield, Va.</LD>
<TE>   Answer: Both provide good cardiovascular workouts, but a rowing
machine is actually a better choice, which may come as a surprise if
you're one of those people who wait patiently in line at the gym for
an elliptical machine.</TE>
<TE>   Because the rowing machine requires full-body aerobic activity, it
uses more muscles--especially in your "core"--than an elliptical
machine. It also requires a greater range of motion in your arms and
legs.</TE>
<TE>   How to row:</TE>
<TE>   * When seated on the rower, maintain a natural arch in your lower
back, trying not to round your lower back when you extend your arms
and bend your knees.</TE>
<TE>   * Keep your knees in line with your ankles. Don't let your knees
bow in or out.</TE>
<TE>   * To keep your upper body properly aligned, don't lock your elbows
when you extend your arms to row.</TE>
<TE>   * Try to keep your shoulders back. Don't round them forward.</TE>
<TE>   Note: Many rowing machines use a fan for resistance, but newer
models use water. This helps simulate movement akin to rowing on a
body of water. See your local fitness store for more information on
the water rowers.</TE>

<HD>Help for Spinal Injuries</HD>
<DH>Some patients with severely impaired walking ability may
benefit from combining treadmill training with an implanted device
that stimulates the spinal cord.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MALCOLM RITTER</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A man with a partial spinal cord injury has gained impressive walking
ability with treadmill training plus an implanted device that
stimulates his spinal cord, suggesting that the combined therapy
might help such patients, researchers report.</LD>
<LD>   About half of spinal cord injury patients have partial injury that
allows some leg muscle movement but not useful walking. Prior studies
have shown that with intensive training on a treadmill, however, some
can learn to walk again.</LD>
<LD>   The man in the new study--Ken Paulson, 44, of Phoenix--was
significantly impaired even after treadmill training. But he showed
much improvement after he started using the stimulator, researchers
reported in the February issue of the journal Spinal Cord.</LD>
<TE>   For example, after four months of treadmill therapy, Paulson
usually needed nearly three minutes to cover 50 feet on the ground
with a walker. By using the stimulator, he cut that to less than a
minute. His own rating of the effort it took to walk dropped from 8
on a 10-point scale to 2.</TE>
<TE>   After four months of training on the ground, he was able to walk
about the length of three football fields, still using the walker.</TE>
<TE>   The walker is mostly for stability and may be traded soon for a
cane, said researcher Dr. Richard Herman of the Good Samaritan
Regional Medical Center in Phoenix. Paulson, who sustained his spinal
cord injury in a traffic accident, also uses a wheelchair for some
tasks, Herman said. Perhaps a quarter to a third of patients with
incomplete spinal cord injury could benefit from combining the
stimulation with treadmill training, Herman estimated Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   He and other experts cautioned that the study focused on only one
patient and that more study would be needed to assess the usefulness
of the combined therapy.</TE>

<HD>Are You Still Getting Good Mileage Out of That 50-Year-Old
Body?</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CONNIE LAUERMAN</AU>
<BD>CHICAGO TRIBUNE</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As an age, the big 5-0 is not quite old but certainly not young. You
can embrace it with a big birthday bash or contemptuously tear up the
inevitable invitation to join AARP.</LD>
<LD>   Nevertheless, visiting the doctor for a checkup at the
half-century mark is bound to be a sobering reality check. Even using
the word "century" in relation to one's own age ... ouch. "What a
doctor sees is the sum total of what's happened for those 50 years,"
said Dr. Jerome Fleg, head of cardiovascular studies for the
Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging, a project begun in 1958.</LD>
<LD>   Consider a car metaphor: Did you squeal around corners, zip
through yellow lights, jam on the brakes at stop signs and change the
oil, oh, every 15,000 miles or so? And you think this baby could last
another 50 years? Even 20? Better have a long look at the owner's
manual to see where you go from here.</LD>
<TE>   Dr. Halina Brukner, a general internist and vice chairman of the
department of medicine at the University of Chicago, called age 50 a
"threshold point, where you need to add some screening tests that
haven't been done previously." Still, "it's not one size fits all,"
cautioned Dr. Carolyn Lopez, chairwoman of family practice at Cook
County Hospital and a spokesman for the American Academy of Family
Physicians.</TE>
<TE>   "There's tremendous variability among 50-year-olds. We all have
both different lifestyles and different genes."</TE>
<TE>   Going back to the car metaphor, some of us had lemons from the
start. No matter how much we babied these vehicles, stretching more
mileage out of them just might not be so easy. Acknowledging this
variability and the fact that disease and deterioration do not
suddenly start at 50, we asked these physicians to go through their
mental checklists and provide a sort of snapshot of the human body at
50, with the idea of what needs checking for the 50-year tuneup.</TE>
<TE>   Men</TE>
<TE>   The prostate gland enlarges with age, and some men might already
be experiencing urinary changes --a narrower stream, trouble getting
started and needing more time to empty the bladder--that may be
evaluated for treatment. For men of average risk for prostate cancer,
a prostate-specific antigen (PSA) screening might be recommended.</TE>
<TE>   Testosterone levels decline with age, and some men might
experience changes in erectile function, although only a relatively
small percentage will experience impotence. Sexual desire may begin
to wane. Nevertheless, a screening test can determine if men have an
abnormally low level of testosterone, and hormone replacement is
available for males, but risks are not documented.</TE>
<TE>   Women</TE>
<TE>   Menopause either has arrived or is imminent. It's time for a
discussion of hormone replacement therapy and perhaps a baseline bone
mineral-density test. Menopausal hormone changes accelerate the bone
loss that occurs naturally and set the stage for osteoporosis, a bone
disease that may not be apparent until symptoms develop.</TE>
<TE>   Despite ongoing controversy over their efficacy, yearly mammograms
are recommended for those at average risk of breast cancer, because
the risk increases after menopause.</TE>
<TE>   Men and Women</TE>
<TE>   The arteries develop stiffer walls, indicated by the systolic
blood pressure (the top number in a reading) going up. The incidence
of hypertension increases, especially among men, although it is not
limited to them. Doctors may consider intervening with medication to
lower blood pressure, preventing further wear and tear on the system.</TE>
<TE>   The heart muscle thickens; it doesn't fill quite as rapidly.
Angina, or heart pain, may develop as a result of disease in the
coronary arteries. The level of HDL (good cholesterol) starts to
decrease. It goes down more rapidly in women, who start out with
higher levels than men. A test measuring cholesterol and other lipids
in the bloodstream becomes important.</TE>
<TE>   During exercise, aerobic capacity, or maximal oxygen consumption,
decreases by the decade, so a 50-year-old typically would have a 20%
to 30% lower maximal oxygen consumption than a 20-year-old. A major
reason is that the heart cannot pump as much blood per minute. A test
of the cardiovascular system under stress would reveal more striking
changes than tests done when it is at rest.</TE>
<TE>   The ratio of muscle and fat in the body changes. Muscle mass
begins to decline, manifested by a modest decline in muscle strength
by age 50. The percentage of body fat goes up significantly with age.
Slowed metabolism, poor eating habits and low levels of physical
inactivity contribute to fat increases. An overall physical would be
a great way to get clearance to become more active and attack the
fat. An active lifestyle can at least slow the pull of age.</TE>
<TE>   Glucose tolerance, the ability to metabolize sugar, declines with
age. For some it will result in diabetes. A blood test for glucose
can be done to determine the risk for diabetes before symptoms and
severe health problems manifest themselves. Thyroid disease becomes
more common, particularly as women get older and if they have a
family history. A thyroid screening might be recommended for some.</TE>
<TE>   Screening for colon cancer, either a flexible sigmoidoscopy or a
more extensive test, colonoscopy, is recommended. For those with a
family history of colon cancer, screening would begin earlier. The
top layer of the skin thins out and collagen breaks down, resulting
in wrinkles and folds.</TE>
<TE>   Brown age spots, the result of sun exposure, may appear. Skin
cancers can occur at any age, but older people are more prone to
developing it. It's a good time to have skin checked for unusual
spots, lumps or changes in moles. Psychological problems such as
depression might crop up at a time of major life changes such as
death in the family or increasing fragility of parents, children
leaving home (or not leaving home) and, in the current economy, job
insecurity. Awards aren't handed out for going it alone through such
problems. There are any number of willing listeners from clergy to
clinics where fees are set by income.</TE>
<TE>   By age 50, changes in memory functioning may become apparent,
particularly in the ability to form new memories, or what's called
new learning ability. Even before age 50, the lenses in the eyes
become less flexible and can't change shape as easily. This normal
condition, a type of refractive error, is called presbyopia, and
usually is noticed as difficulty reading at close range.</TE>

<HD>After the Abdominal Work, Put Your Back Into It</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Even if your regular exercise routine includes abdominal curls and
push-ups, you're not done yet. It's a good idea to spend a few more
minutes training your back with some extension exercises before
heading for the shower. Reversing the direction of your spine with
extensions will relieve the tightness you just created in your
abdominal, chest and shoulder muscles. Extensions will also
strengthen and balance the muscles supporting your spine.</LD>
<LD>   Years ago, back bends or back extensions were considered risky or
unsafe. But now these stretches are frequently prescribed by
orthopedic physicians, chiropractors and physical therapists. Most
fitness and medical experts agree that safely moving our backs in an
arched position promotes a healthier spine and helps to counteract
the sitting we do in everyday life.</LD>
<LD>   Try starting with a modified back-bending yoga pose such as the
"half cobra." Without a lot of movement, you'll immediately feel your
upper and middle back muscles being engaged while you get a nice
release in the front of your shoulders and across your chest. If you
do this pose regularly, you'll learn what parts of your upper body
are weak, providing you with a benchmark on which to improve.</LD>
<TE>   As your back gets stronger and your chest and shoulders become
more flexible you can progress to a more challenging pose, called
"upward facing dog." This advanced movement requires substantial
wrist, elbow and shoulder mobility, so don't force yourself to do it
if you have weakness or injuries in any of those areas.</TE>
<TE>   Half Cobra</TE>
<TE>   Begin by lying face down on a mat or a padded surface. Keep the
tops of your feet on the floor and tighten the muscles in the front
of your thighs to lift the kneecaps off the floor. Maintain this
lower body position as you place your hands on the floor under your
shoulders. Your fingers should face forward, and your elbows should
point back to your feet. On an inhale, without putting much weight on
your hands, use your back muscles to gently raise your head,
shoulders and chest off the floor. Hold the position as you exhale.
Your elbows will be bent. On your next inhalation, raise your chest
one inch higher and maintain this height as you exhale. Breathe in
one more time, trying to lift a little higher. As you lift,
concentrate on pressing your chest forward between your hands and
move your shoulders down and away from your ears.</TE>
<TE>   Exhale and lower yourself to the floor. Stretch your arms
alongside your body with your palms turned up. Rotate your head to
one side, rest and breathe.</TE>
<TE>   Repeat this exercise one more time, making sure your elbows are
tucked in next to your waist when you lift up. On the release, turn
your head to the other side for an even stretch to your neck.</TE>
<TE>   Upward Facing Dog</TE>
<TE>   To begin, lie face down on a mat or padded surface. Keep the tops
of your feet on the floor and tighten the muscles in the front of
your thighs to lift the kneecaps off the floor. Maintain this lower
body position just as you did in the half cobra, but this time slide
your hands back so that your fingertips are just below your shoulders
and the heels of your hands are close to your waist. On an inhale,
push down through your hands and slowly lift your head, shoulders and
chest off the floor. Begin to straighten your arms and continue to
rise until your abdomen, hips and thighs are completely off the
floor.</TE>
<TE>   Look forward and pull your shoulder blades back and together.
Focus on moving the tops of your shoulders down and away from your
ears. Keep your legs straight and relax your buttocks. Take two or
three slow, deep breaths while holding the pose. Slowly lower
yourself to the floor and rest a moment. Repeat the exercise once or
twice more.</TE>
<TE>   Remember, it's not enough to focus only on flexibility or only on
strength training. It may be a humbling experience at first, but
weaving yoga postures like these into your athletic training will pay
off in the long run. When you master exercises that require both
strength and agility, you'll end up with a strong, powerful body that
moves gracefully.</TE>

<DL>ATLANTA</DL>
<LD>ATLANTA -- Whooping cough, which dropped steadily in the United
States for much of the 20th century, has made a comeback in the last
20 years, the government reported Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said it recorded
nearly 8,000 cases in 2000, up from about 2,000 a year in the early
1980s.</LD>
<LD>   The CDC said the increase in adult and adolescent cases occurred
mostly because doctors are better at recognizing and diagnosing the
disease, which can produce a cough strong enough to break a rib.</LD>
<TE>   But the agency said the increase among infants is probably real.
Infants, who account for about 30% of all U.S. cases, have the
highest whooping cough rate in the country--55 cases for every
100,000 babies.</TE>
<TE>   The CDC's Dr. Kris Bisgard said experts are not entirely sure what
might be causing the increase in infant cases--only that more infants
are apparently being exposed to coughing illnesses.</TE>
<TE>   Whooping cough, or pertussis, is a bacterial infection that looks
like a cold at first. Infants are particularly vulnerable during
their first six months, before they have completed their first three
doses of vaccine.</TE>
<TE>   There is a national shortage of whooping cough vaccine that, the
CDC said, will probably persist until at least midyear.</TE>
<TE>   The vaccine was developed in the 1940s, when the United States at
times recorded more than 200,000 cases a year.</TE>

<HD>A New Country Music Compilation</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The "Now That's What I Call Music" series of pop and rock hits
compilations has been monstrously successful since it was introduced
to U.S. consumers in 1998. Contemporary Christian music companies
annually put out a similar series called "Wow."</LD>
<LD>   In country music, however, record executives have refused to put
hit singles on multi-artist compilations, believing that sales of the
artists' own albums would suffer if consumers could buy their big hit
elsewhere.</LD>
<LD>   That changes this week with Tuesday's release of "Totally
Country," the first "Now"-like album featuring country hits from a
variety of labels. Among the acts are established stars such as
Dwight Yoakam, Dixie Chicks, Travis Tritt and John Michael
Montgomery, along with newer faces including Blake Shelton, Keith
Urban, Trick Pony and Tammy Cochran.</LD>
<TE>   The participating companies are the RCA Label Group, Warner Bros.
Nashville and Sony Music Nashville. As with the "Now" series, the
"Totally Country" volumes will be released yearly by each of those
labels on a rotating basis, with an initial commitment for three
volumes. The first installment is on RCA-owned BNA label.</TE>
<TE>   "What you're seeing those guys doing signals some kind of a sea
change," says Lon Helton, country music editor for the Radio &amp;
Records trade publication. "Historically, you've never seen as many
country compilations as you do in pop. But I think people are seeing
that to attract the consumer, they're going to have to do it this
way."</TE>
<TE>   "It's an idea we have resisted for a long time, but now the time
has come," says RLG Chairman Joe Galante. "We are not trying to give
away the business. We want to give a tasteful compilation with hits
of this genre that's a good value for the consumer and still leave a
solid business."</TE>

<HD>WGA Nods May Sharpen Oscar Race</HD>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Amid the Oscar buzz swirling over who might receive nominations this
year for best picture, actor, actress and director, one of the more
lively contests may be among that segment of the filmmaking industry
that never seems to feel it gets enough respect: the writers.</LD>
<LD>   How the Academy Award battle may take shape might get a little
clearer Thursday when the Writers Guild of America announces its
nominees for the best original and best adapted screenplays of 2001.</LD>
<LD>   The field is crowded in the adapted screenplay category, with
films such as "In the Bedroom," "Shrek," "Ghost World," "Lantana,"
"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," "Black Hawk
Down," "Bridget Jones's Diary," "The Shipping News" and "A Beautiful
Mind" all considered heavyweight contenders. And that doesn't include
dark-horse candidates such as "The Deep End."</LD>
<TE>   Vying for original screenplay honors will be Julian Fellowes for
"Gosford Park," David Mamet for "Heist," Joel and Ethan Coen for "The
Man Who Wasn't There" and director Wes Anderson and actor Owen Wilson
for "The Royal Tenenbaums." Other viable contenders are "Memento,"
"Monster's Ball" and "No Man's Land."</TE>
<TE>   This year, 187 films are eligible for the WGA award--76 adapted
screenplays and 111 original screenplays. A WGA spokeswoman said that
about 80% of the time, one or both winners of the WGA awards go on to
win the Oscar. "It's a very good barometer in the writing
categories," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Although serious dramas filled with action sequences such as
"Rocky" and "Dances With Wolves" have won writing honors in years
past, it is rare, she said, that WGA members honor action movies or
films with more than two writers in the credits.</TE>
<TE>   The awards will be handed out March 2 in Beverly Hills and New
York. The WGA has more than 10,000 members who are eligible to vote.</TE>

<HD>'Black Hawk Down' Holds On to Prime Territory</HD>
<DH>Box office * Weekend's newcomers, including 'Slackers' and
'Birthday Girl,' perform weakly. Super Bowl expected to keep numbers
down.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID GERMAIN</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A slow Super Bowl weekend at theaters helped lift "Black Hawk Down"
to another box-office victory as the combat thriller took in $11.5
million to remain the No. 1 film for the third straight weekend.</LD>
<LD>   Only a couple of fresh movies were released, leaving the top 10
largely the same as last week, when studios dumped out a rush of new
films.</LD>
<LD>   "Snow Dogs" was No. 2 for the third weekend in a row, grossing
$9.9 million, according to studio estimates Sunday. The rest of the
top five were bunched tightly, with "The Count of Monte Cristo" at $9
million, "A Walk to Remember" at $8.8 million and "A Beautiful Mind"
at $8.5 million.</LD>
<TE>   The gross-out campus comedy "Slackers" debuted weakly with $3
million, tying for No. 10 with "Orange County." Playing in 1,893
theaters, "Slackers" averaged just $1,585, compared with $3,659 in
3,143 theaters for "Black Hawk Down."</TE>
<TE>   Nicole Kidman's latest, "Birthday Girl," took in $2.5 million in
1,000 theaters for a $2,500 average. Kidman plays a Russian
mail-order bride whose arrival wrecks the life of a lonely British
bank clerk (Ben Chaplin).</TE>
<TE>   "The newcomers couldn't get arrested this weekend," said Paul
Dergarabedian, president of Exhibitor Relations, which tracks the box
office.</TE>
<TE>   "Black Hawk Down," director Ridley Scott's fiery dramatization of
a U.S. military operation gone awry in Somalia, has taken in $75.5
million. The film was in its third weekend of wide release after a
limited debut in December.</TE>
<TE>   Distributor Sony provided 15 videotape copies to the Defense
Department for soldiers in Afghanistan to watch, said studio
spokesman Steve Elzer.</TE>
<TE>   Because of the Super Bowl, studios lowered estimates for Sunday
film revenues, expecting the game to keep audiences at home. Sony
figured ticket sales for "Black Hawk Down" on Sunday would be off
about 65% from Saturday. The normal drop between Saturday and Sunday
would be 35 to 40%, said Jeff Blake, Sony president of worldwide
marketing and distribution.</TE>
<TE>   "The bottom line for the Super Bowl is it's a slow moviegoing
day," Blake said.</TE>
<TE>   Still, weekend revenues rose. The top 12 movies grossed $80.6
million, up 11% from the same period a year ago, which was a
non-Super Bowl weekend.</TE>
<TE>   With a $267.1 million total so far domestically, "The Lord of the
Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring" will pass "Shrek" this week to
become the second-highest-grossing film released in 2001. "Harry
Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone" was No. 1 at $312.9 million and
counting.</TE>
<TE>   "A Beautiful Mind" climbed to $104.6 million, the 18th film
released last year to cross the $100-million mark.</TE>

<HD>Settlement Reached With Rudin Over Musical 'Gold!'</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DON SHIRLEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Composer Stephen Sondheim and librettist John Weidman have reached a
settlement with movie and stage producer Scott Rudin over rights to
the musical "Gold!"</LD>
<LD>   Rudin and several others invested in a 1999 workshop of Sondheim
and Weidman's musical, then called "Wise Guys." After it was poorly
received, plans for the show were dropped until Sondheim and Weidman
decided to revive it for a production at the Goodman Theatre in
Chicago this fall.</LD>
<LD>   Rudin, alone among the workshop investors, threatened legal action
against the Goodman and director Hal Prince, contending that he had
rights to the material.</LD>
<TE>   Sondheim and Weidman then sued Rudin, who countersued after a New
York court issued a temporary restraining order against him.</TE>
<TE>   In the settlement, Rudin will receive $157,000 if the show
receives a commercial production, said John Breglio, attorney for
Sondheim and Weidman. The planned Chicago production is at the
not-for-profit Goodman, so it would not entail a payment to Rudin.</TE>
<TE>   Rudin told the New York Times that the settlement amount equaled
"the entirety of my investment" in the workshop. He declined to
comment when he was reached Saturday by the Los Angeles Times.</TE>
<TE>   Breglio said the settlement amount was "a calculation based on
what it's worth for us to move on," but added that Sondheim and
Weidman "have no idea what Rudin spent" for the workshop.</TE>
<TE>   Roche Schulfer, executive director of the Goodman, said the show,
which had been shelved in the wake of Rudin's legal threats, is now
"on our radar screen for this season or next." Discussions about the
status of the production will resume today.</TE>

<HD>10 Ways to Escape Hollywood's Gofer Hole</HD>
<DH>Speak up all you want and keep your autograph book handy,
advises a college student who landed a job on 'Slackers.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ZACK EMERY</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Two summers ago, I worked on "Slackers," a movie directed by Dewey
Nicks that depicts a crew of college hustlers parlaying and partying
their way through school. For a student at UC Santa Cruz, working as
an assistant to the director on the movie--which opened Friday--it
seemed like another day at the office.</LD>
<LD>   I learned an important lesson while working on the set of
"Slackers": You don't get what you deserve in life; you get what you
negotiate. For example, getting work in Hollywood is a pitch. To get
hired by Dewey Nicks, I use four magical negotiating words: "I love
your work."</LD>
<LD>   Day 1, my first official duty is to chauffeur Dewey and his wife,
Stephanie, out to the shoot in Riverside. I park my 6-year-old Acura
in Dewey's driveway at 4:30 a.m., the time I usually go to bed. My
foul mood improves as I slip behind the wheel of his Mercedes S600,
and I have a spiritual insight. Driving a $125,000 automobile gives
you that calm, Buddhist feeling.</LD>
<TE>   I figure that to move up to a nicer ride, I'd better learn the
rules of the game. Writers Bill Robinson and Ceridwen Morris in their
book "It's All Your Fault: How to Make It as a Hollywood Assistant"
give 10 rules on how to behave on a set. The rules are very
helpful--if you do completely the opposite.</TE>
<TE>   Rule 1: Don't speak unless spoken to.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, speak up, and with a forked tongue. I discover the best
talkers on the set make the most money and do the least work. The
producers, who have the deepest pockets, come in late and go home
early because, as one told me, "being insincere all day really drains
you." In fact, the theme of "Slackers" is sometimes a lie, which is
the most honest thing you can say--a sentiment near and dear to the
hearts of the producers.</TE>
<TE>   The coolest part about saying things that you don't mean in
Hollywood is that even if they catch you in an outright lie, everyone
has the decency not to go on about it. The first few days, the
producers and agents pose, bluff and use red herrings and smoke
screens to squeeze the last drop of blood from each other. The big
negotiation is over how much to pay Eminem to make a cameo
appearance. I argue that Eminem's appearance in the trailer will
double the opening weekend gross. I don't really believe this, but I
want a chance to meet him.</TE>
<TE>   Rule 2: Knock loudly on trailer doors before entering.</TE>
<TE>   Forget it. Why would anyone want to be in the movie business and
not hang out with movie stars? Instead, get personal. Hollywood is
high school with money.</TE>
<TE>   I was in high school two years ago, so I know you don't make
friends by showing deference or by respecting others' privacy. I'm
not saying you have to go clubbing all night with them (and then try
to explain to their girlfriends why they didn't get home until 6
a.m.), but it doesn't hurt.</TE>
<TE>   Nearly everyone who works on "Slackers" was in one of my favorite
movies or TV shows. Devon Sawa starred in "Final Destination." Jason
Schwartzman starred in "Rushmore." Jason Segel was on "Freaks and
Geeks." But I'm not in awe of actors or directors. My dirty little
secret is I want to become friends with the producers.</TE>
<TE>   My role model is "Slackers" producer Erik Feig. After college, he
gets a job at a big agency. They show him to the mailroom and tell
him he might make full agent in five years. He quits at lunchtime. He
finds the novel "I Know What You Did Last Summer" at a garage sale
and, without even reading it, successfully pitches it to director
Kevin Williamson.</TE>
<TE>   Rule 3: Never talk to neighbors on location.</TE>
<TE>   Why not? Neighbors are there to be played. The producers
generously allow one local to work for free. He gets so into it that
when the shoot moves back to L.A., he borrows gas money from his mom
so he can make the commute each day.</TE>
<TE>   I pick up a few tips on horse trading by hanging out with the
producers. This pays off when Dewey asks me to pick up some pigeon
feathers that don't look right in the scene. I ponder how producer
Neil Moritz (a.k.a. Mr. Big) would handle this and offer a couple of
12-year-old kids from the neighborhood cigarettes if they pick up the
feathers. After they're finished, I tell them I don't smoke and
lecture them on the evils of smoking.</TE>
<TE>   Rule 4: Don't complain about the food.</TE>
<TE>   If you can't complain about the food, what in the world do you
talk about over lunch? Instead, to make it big, whine about
everything. Haven't you noticed that the rich are always complaining?</TE>
<TE>   On the set, complaining is the chief negotiating tactic. The crew
swaps war stories in attempts to top each other. A camera operator
says, "You try being on 'The Perfect Storm' and spend the whole day
in water." A grip responds, "That's nothing. Try watching Tom Cruise
do the 18-minute crying scene in 'Magnolia' 42 times."</TE>
<TE>   If I have any doubts about complaints being gold, I just have to
look at the best negotiator on the set, the line producer. He's like
an eighth-grade hall monitor on a mission from God to stamp out all
wasteful spending. He has been rumored to pull pencil stubs out of
the trash and mutter, "Still good."</TE>
<TE>   The only person who can't complain on the set is the writer. In
between shots, I suggest a line. The writer complains, "Hey! You
can't use that. It's from 'Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure.'" One
of the producers snaps back at the writer, "If you're going to be
negative, we're going to kick you off the set."</TE>
<TE>   Rule 5: Don't sit down unless invited.</TE>
<TE>   What do you want to be? A waiter or a player? Instead, always sit
at the power table.</TE>
<TE>   After a long day, Dewey treats the crew to drinks. I go down to
the hotel bar, take a seat at the power table and lean back to watch
the big-screen television. I tell myself, "Here I am, 20 years old,
on location, sitting with the stars, the director and the producers
and watching the Lakers in the NBA finals. This is truly as good as
it gets."</TE>
<TE>   Rule 6: Never walk on a set while they're shooting.</TE>
<TE>   C'mon, the movie business is about getting noticed. How else will
the production company know you've been there? Even if they yell at
you, you're getting your daily dose of attention. You should break
this rule just for the heck of it. In Hollywood, as in "Fight Club,"
the only rule is there's no rule. If you're not in trouble with
someone on the set, you're doing something wrong.</TE>
<TE>   For example, one time I take the dailies back to Dewey's house in
L.A. It's 3 in the morning when I get there. I'm too tired to try to
figure out how to make the house key work, so I stash the dailies in
a shed next to the house. The next morning though, I begin to think:
10 hours of film, at $30,000 an hour. That's $300,000. I'm not
worried someone will steal the film, but the temperature is heading
into the 90s. Maybe there's a reason they keep film in refrigerators.
I wonder how much forgiveness is in the producers' hearts. But,
fortunately, my slacker luck holds, and all is well.</TE>
<TE>   Rule 7: Don't offer opinions on script, performances or direction.</TE>
<TE>   This is like saying, "Don't breathe." Everyone on the set, from
the driver, Harry the Horse, to the catering guy, wants to direct.
Instead, learn to promote your opinions.</TE>
<TE>   If you ever want to strike The Big Deal, you better learn the art
of shameless self-promotion. This means whenever possible, escalate
your self-promoting opinions to fact ("I don't think so, I know so").</TE>
<TE>   Dewey is my model of fearlessness. I see him scared only once,
when the "Bond Lady from the Valley" comes to visit the set. The
persistent story is that she punched out James Cameron for going over
budget on "Titanic."</TE>
<TE>   Rule 8: Don't predict how the project will do.</TE>
<TE>   You don't have to be a weatherman to know which way others want
the wind to blow.</TE>
<TE>   I learn that if you do offer opinions, always predict success.
Everyone agrees from watching the dailies that "Slackers" is a
hilarious movie. All, that is, except one old crew member who scoffs,
"When have you ever been on a movie where the dailies didn't look
great?" No wonder the dude is in a dead-end job.</TE>
<TE>   Rule 9: Never ask for haircuts or makeup.</TE>
<TE>   Measly haircuts? The coolest clothes in my closet come from the
"Slackers" set. It's not whether to ask, but whom to ask for what and
when. Don't just ask for a haircut. How about a three-picture deal?</TE>
<TE>   Rule 10: Never ask for autographs.</TE>
<TE>   Get real. What about asking stars to sign their underwear so you
can auction it off on EBay? The only thing celebrities hate more than
being asked for their autograph is not being asked.</TE>
<TE>   Asking for autographs is the best way to kiss up to people.</TE>
<TE>   Even the line producer knows there are times when you have to kiss
up to others. We spend the last shooting days in the pool area at
USC, where the crew continues to complain about his tightness. So he
springs for a cappuccino machine and a sushi bar. The caffeine kicks
in, and everyone gets giddy and touchy-feely. As the line producer
walks around serving cappuccinos and lattes, everyone tells him how
much they love him.</TE>
<TE>   After "Slackers" wraps, I go to Dewey's house to watch a rough
cut. I normally sneak into movies, but I'd pay to see this one. I
tell Dewey, "Since Kubrick is dead, you have to be the greatest
living filmmaker. And, by the way, if you shoot a movie next summer,
deal me in."</TE>
<TE>   Postscript: "Slackers" opened last Friday Parents and graybeard
reviewers hate it; kids love it--well I did anyway. I smell teen cult
classic.</TE>

<HD>Philharmonic's Sure-Fire Mahler</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD S. GINELL</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>If you want to make a hit with Mahler's tempestuous, gut-wrenching,
ultimately triumphant Symphony No. 5, here's a sure-fire way to do
it. Get yourself a fine orchestra that knows the piece inside out,
follow Mahler's fantastically detailed instructions, keep the pace
moving, try to avoid doing anything fussy and just enjoy the ride.</LD>
<LD>   Basically, that's what guest conductor Yakov Kreizberg did with
the Los Angeles Philharmonic on Friday night at the Dorothy Chandler
Pavilion.</LD>
<LD>   Leading the score from memory, Kreizberg let it run on schedule
right down the middle of the tempo spectrum, letting the bursts of
fury erupt naturally, patiently waiting out the passages of stasis.
It helped that the Philharmonic plays the Mahler Fifth so beautifully
and easily these days, with a unified string response that was almost
unheard-of as recently as a decade ago. And sure enough, it got a
standing ovation.</LD>
<TE>   Yet this Mahler Fifth, as expertly performed as it was, didn't
drive you crazy or plunge you into its depths. It needed a more
imaginative hand, one that could take Mahler at his word and push his
music to even greater emotional extremes.</TE>
<TE>   But Kreizberg did score one major point. He seems convinced that
the Adagietto is truly Mahler's musical love letter to his wife,
Alma, not the doleful eulogy that it has become so often these days.
So he chose a fast tempo at first, making it flow and sing with
heart-melting ardor before slowing it way down toward the close as
per Mahler's instructions.</TE>
<TE>   Mozart's somber Piano Concerto No. 24 in C minor, K. 491, was an
appropriate preface for Mahler as Kreizberg's leisurely, lush
accompaniment blended into pianist Lars Vogt's sometimes overly
precious interpretation. For all of Vogt's thoughtful searching, he
didn't find much.</TE>

<HD>Mitchell a Strong Leader of the Count Basie Band</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DON HECKMAN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Grover Mitchell, who has been leading the Count Basie Band for more
than five years, insists that the ensemble not be described as a
"ghost band." The group's performance at Segerstrom Hall in the
Orange County Performing Arts Center on Friday night clearly defined
why he feels that way. Ghost bands--groups that continue to exist as
musical entities, under new direction, after the original leader
passes away (think Glenn Miller, Woody Herman, etc.)--rarely possess
the of vital adventurousness displayed by the Basie Band under
Mitchell.</LD>
<LD>   Ironically, the most compelling performances were almost all
associated with Basie classics--"Li'l Darling," "April in Paris,"
"Cute," "Basie" and the like. Unlike more typical ghost-band
renderings in which pieces are run down by rote, often repeating
note-for-note the solos from the originals, the Basie players'
versions of these items were galvanized by driving rhythm,
hard-swinging solos and powerhouse ensemble passages.</LD>
<LD>   The list of players moving to the microphone to display their
improvisational magic included saxophonists Kenny Hing and Jackie
Kelson, drummer Butch Miles and pianist Tony Suggs. Vocalist Jamie
Davis added dark-hued vocals on "You Are Too Beautiful" and "Autumn
Leaves," his singing distinctly, and pleasantly, reminiscent of the
late great Joe Williams.</LD>
<TE>   A substantial part of the program, however, made far less use of
the Basie Band. Drawing from the group's recording "Count Plays
Duke," the ensemble performed with the Pacific Symphony Pops,
balancing the Basie rhythmic groove with the symphony's elegant
strings. The arrangements, by Allyn Ferguson, who conducted the
symphony portions, were well crafted and well played.</TE>
<TE>   But the sheer vitality of another Basie item, "In a Mellow Tone,"
arranged by Frank Foster, underscored the superfluousness of the
symphonic passages. Given that performances such as this open up a
large arena of possibilities, one couldn't help but wish that a
larger portion of the program had been allocated to a pure,
unadulterated performance by Basie ensemble.</TE>

<LD>My emotions are a roller coaster.</LD>
<LD>   I was disappointed when Mike Tyson was denied a license to fight
for the heavyweight championship in Las Vegas.</LD>
<LD>   Not that the Nevada State Athletic Commission's rejection of Tyson
was a surprise. Sports gurus had predicted that decision after Tyson
appeared to purposely initiate a brawl to open what was to be a
televised press conference promoting his originally scheduled April 6
fight with champion Lennox Lewis.</LD>
<TE>   Instead, I was let down because I like boxing and was looking
forward to a bout that held the prospect of one fighter again biting
another, as Tyson did Evander Holyfield in 1997, and as Lewis accused
him of doing to his leg at that aborted press conference.</TE>
<TE>   A clean punch to the mandible, lifting the head from the neck, is
plenty good, let me tell you. Yet teeth applied to flesh in the ring
is something special. It could be the biggest chew since "Silence of
the Lambs," to say nothing of "Jaws," and a spectacle I wouldn't want
to miss.</TE>
<TE>   I'm not kidding.</TE>
<TE>   Forget Sunday's manufactured hoopla in New Orleans. This would be
a Super Bowl.</TE>
<TE>   So my mood is rosy again because, as everyone is now reporting
following this paper's scoop, Tyson may get to bite Lewis in Los
Angeles at Staples Center, or perhaps even at the Great Western
Forum, if not somewhere else on the planet where it's understood that
boxing is meant to be a circus. You don't hire a pair of thick necks,
dress them in fright wigs and flappy shoes and expect "The
Nutcracker."</TE>
<TE>   If Tyson asks, will the California State Athletic Commission say
yes? My fingers are crossed. And if Tyson does get to fight Lewis,
wherever, and squanders this opportunity to bite him up close and
personal, will I again be disappointed? Yes. And teed off at him,
too.</TE>
<TE>   The common wisdom is that we're a kinder, gentler, more tender
society since Sept. 11, but many of us still like our sports gore.</TE>
<TE>   Wipe that scowl from your face. As if you didn't feel the same
way.</TE>
<TE>   Ours is a forgiving culture that welcomes bad actors from politics
and sports back into the fold of respectability like redeemed
sinners. Whoever you are or whatever your venom, you'll thrive
financially if your infamy earns a profit for someone else.</TE>
<TE>   Take a deep whiff, however, for hypocrisy is in the air.</TE>
<TE>   It begins with TV newscasters being so revolted by the mayhem and
Tyson's aggression at the press conference that they ran footage of
it again and again and again. They know an exploding Vesuvius makes
great TV.</TE>
<TE>   Many of them are the same two-faced sportscasters who
sanctimoniously indict hockey brawlers, then celebrate this ice
violence by granting it prominence on their highlight reels. They're
the same frauds who ridiculed and smirked at former pro basketballer
Dennis Rodman's tattoos and tantrums while featuring them
conspicuously, the same crowd that tsk-tsk-ed at John McEnroe's
blowups on the tennis court while loving every one of them.</TE>
<TE>   And, yes, the same dissemblers who, while publicly wringing their
hands about Tyson's outbursts and mental health, secretly pray to
Holy Nielsen that when he does inevitably get in touch with his dark
side, they'll have cameras there to videotape the savagery.</TE>
<TE>   If you think there isn't more to Tyson than one-dimensional
terror, then you didn't see Barbara Koppel's remarkable 1993
documentary on NBC, "Fallen Champ, the Untold Story of Mike Tyson."
Despite a lack of formal education, he seems intelligent and complex.</TE>
<TE>   But also deeply troubled, dysfunctional and even destructive,
based on his criminal record, to say nothing of recent sexual-assault
allegations made against him. Sportscasters know the tinderbox they
get with Tyson, however, and they relish it. Neither he, nor any of
the others, could have bad-acted their way into sportscasts without a
free pass from these faux moralists.</TE>
<TE>   As for the press conference in the MGM Grand that Tyson began by
appearing to angrily charge Lewis without provocation, puh-leeeeeeze!</TE>
<TE>   It was obviously going to be one of those inane, tailored-for-TV
burlesques that are now obligatory for high-profile matchups. You
know, a staged media event where fighters go nose to nose and glare
at each other solely to create interest in their fight, with many in
the press dutifully abetting them by lapping it up. Which is what
they do best.</TE>
<TE>   I can hear the Fox Sports headline now: "Mike Tyson made a public
appearance today. And wait 'til you see what happened!"</TE>
<TE>   So naturally the room was packed with media for pitchmen Tyson and
Lewis. And we're to believe that these reporters who arrived there
expecting to cover scripted growls, which was fine with them, were
stunned--yes, horrified--when the anger on Tyson's part turned out to
be real?</TE>
<TE>   Phony rage they love, phony rage they can handle. But not the real
stuff? Actual news breaking out at a show for the media? Why, what
was the world coming to?</TE>
<TE>   What's it coming to, also, if this violent sport loses its most
violent man because too many are scared to admit they're drawn to his
volatility? Enough already.</TE>
<TE>   Give Mike Tyson a break and let him fight in the ring so we all
can enjoy him for what he can bring to the sport while he's still
flossing. His boxing skills may have eroded, but his teeth remain
strong.</TE>

<HD>'Sesame Street' Travels Down a New Road</HD>
<DH>Television*  Competition prompts the show to begin its 33rd
season with a simplified format for young viewers.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELIZABETH JENSEN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Getting to "Sesame Street'' is going to be a little bit easier for
the show's youngest viewers, starting today.</LD>
<LD>   The home of Big Bird and Elmo enters its 33rd season with what it
is calling its most extensive overhaul, a result of intense
competition in the children's TV arena and an audience that is
getting ever younger.</LD>
<LD>   The overall goal was to make the show simpler to follow. Some of
the changes are subtle, but others, such as a "Journey to Ernie"
segment designed to look like a CD-ROM game, may prove startling to
longtime viewers, and possibly a risk to the show.</LD>
<TE>   Still, executives at parent Sesame Workshop say the alterations
are needed to keep the program, which has seen its ratings slip in
recent years, vital at a time when there are more options for
children.</TE>
<TE>   "We have no control over societal changes; we just try to keep up
with them," said Arlene Sherman, co-executive producer.</TE>
<TE>   The franchise started in 1968 as a show designed to prepare 3- to
5-year-olds for school. But its success soon drew more and more
players into the children's TV business, with shows such as "Barney"
and "Teletubbies" aimed at even younger children, and Nickelodeon
programs such as "Blue's Clues" promoting interactivity. Parents and
day-care providers raised on "Sesame Street," eager to give children
an educational head start, also began putting younger and younger
children in front of the TV set.</TE>
<TE>   As a result, the show is now watched more by  2- to 4-year-olds.
For a program grounded in extensive educational research, even one
year can mean a big difference in both the curriculum the program
teaches and how those children learn.</TE>
<TE>   In the summer of 2000, Sesame Workshop started to put change in
motion, convening a summit to brainstorm with an array of children's
entertainers, including rivals. Then a year ago, producers gathered
with "Sesame Street" writers and "deconstructed what's sacred and
what's not," said Sherman. "We know what's at stake here, and we
don't want to throw the baby out with the bathwater." There was also
a concern that the show not be "dumbed down" so much that children
weren't challenged.</TE>
<TE>   The humor and characters that children identify with were
indispensable, Sherman said. But what she calls the show's
"laissez-faire format" had to give way. Also complicating the picture
were kids' familiarity these days with computers and other video
forms and the show's hour length in a world where most shows are 30
minutes.</TE>
<TE>   In its biggest change to appeal to the younger crowd, "Sesame
Street" has broken itself into segments that will air at the same
time every day, just as a segment called "Elmo's World" has since
1999. The predictability mimics the nap and snack routines of
toddlers.</TE>
<TE>   The "Street Story" will now air in a single 10-minute block from
beginning to end, instead of being woven throughout the show. In
addition, the "Letter of the Day" will always be introduced (and
eventually, eaten) by Cookie Monster, and the day's number by the
Count. Rosita will present a Spanish word each day.</TE>
<TE>   The "Journey to Ernie" segment is a direct response to new video
technologies. Big Bird and Ernie appear caught up in a CD-ROM game,
playing hide-and-seek; on today's show, when Big Bird ducks under a
bridge, he finds himself in outer space. Children are encouraged to
help Big Bird solve the problem of where to find Ernie.</TE>
<TE>   Kids probably won't notice the academic distinction, but Sherman
said "Sesame Street" has also taken a new stance on how to teach
numbers. The program has always displayed what numbers look like but
now will reinforce that by using animation and live-action films,
showing "not just what the symbol is, but that 10 things, no matter
how configured, is still 10," she said.</TE>
<TE>   The changes are being accompanied by a major promotional push,
including a live appearance this morning by Big Bird, Elmo and
executive producer Michael Loman on NBC's "Today" show. In a nod to
the more competitive world of children's TV, Sesame Workshop has also
stepped up marketing and product tie-ins for the program. Bubble bath
and purified water are just some of the latest products to carry a
"Sesame Street" brand.</TE>
<TE>   Sesame Workshop has won praise over the years for keeping the show
relevant  for three decades.  Longtime children's television advocate
Peggy Charren hasn't seen the current changes but said the ones being
discussed make sense. "For a long time they were almost the only
program like that on the tube, and now all of children's TV has
competition," she said.</TE>
<TE>   One question is whether the revisions will simplify the show too
much for parents. Producers have always tried to encourage parents to
watch with their children, but adding a second level of meaning in
the writing this year was "much more of a challenge," Sherman said.</TE>
<TE>   Celebrities such as musical group Destiny's Child, actor Ray
Romano and United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan have always
been included largely for the parents' benefit, and about the same
number will appear this season.</TE>
<TE>   There will also be an attempt to address issues stemming from the
Sept. 11 terror attacks. Although those events won't be mentioned
directly, four shows will deal with tolerance, mutual respect and
fear. In today's program, Elmo gets scared when a fire breaks out at
Hooper's store and refuses to return. A real firefighter takes him to
a New York City firehouse for a tour and a discussion about people
whose jobs are to help others.</TE>
<TE>   No adult viewer will be unmoved by the real children who follow,
including the child who said firefighters need to be "brave" and
"pure-hearted," and the Dalmatian-petting boy who says, "Firedogs are
really excellent, and they're so great because they are so
excellent."</TE>
<TE>   "Sesame Street" is shown at 7 a.m. daily on KCET.</TE>

<HD>The Daily Struggle to Shelter Orphans From the Storm</HD>
<DH>Television* Cinemax film documents the challenges at an
orphanage for 60 Cambodian children. 'It is less than ideal living,'
says the woman running it.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SUSAN KING</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Geraldine Cox doesn't seem the likeliest candidate to run an
orphanage. No Mother Theresa, she peppers her conversation with
expletives, and her long hair is dyed several shades of red and pink.
But the outgoing 56-year-old Australian, who describes herself as
"the milkman's daughter," has run the Sunrise Children's Village in
Cambodia since 1993.</LD>
<LD>   Her life and work provides the focus of a "Cinemax Reel Life"
documentary, "My Khmer Heart," premiering Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   Written, directed and produced by Janine Hosking and narrated by
Peter Ustinov, "My Khmer Heart" was filmed over three years and
chronicles Cox's battles to keep the orphanage open amid political
strife in the country. It has been an uphill battle.</LD>
<TE>   Two years ago, Cox almost lost the orphanage when its owner,
Cambodia's Princess Marie--the wife of the country's former leader,
Prince Norodom Ranariddh--told Cox that she and the children had to
vacate the premises. So Cox turned to the new prime minster, Hun Sen,
for help. Much to Cox's surprise, the prime minster gave her more
than 10 acres of free land to build a new orphanage.</TE>
<TE>   "The documentary has a happy ending," Cox said during a recent
interview in Los Angeles. "But I haven't had success in raising the
money to build what we need on the site. I have raised enough money
to build a dike to stop the floodwaters. I raised enough money to put
up a fence and another $55,000 to do the earthworks program [to get
the land ready for construction of dormitories]."</TE>
<TE>   For the last year, Cox, her staff and 53 orphans have been living
in a rented villa.</TE>
<TE>   "When I say a rented villa, I don't mean a villa," Cox says. "It's
just a small, five-bedroom house, and there are over 60 of us in
those bedrooms," she said. "The children, the staff and myself, and
the kids are sleeping in hammocks. We don't have a kitchen, so we
cook outside in the weather, we eat outside in the weather, we
prepare food outside in the weather, and during the rainy season for
four months of the year, we were up to our knees in water in the
girls' dorm.... We often don't have enough water to flush toilets. So
it is less than ideal living. It is Third World living."</TE>
<TE>   That said, she added: "When I compare myself to the Cambodians who
live pretty much like we live all the time, I don't think I can go
back to the government and say, 'Give me money.' He has already done
more for us than he has for a lot of his own people."</TE>
<TE>   To raise the $1 million to build dormitories and a school, Cox has
gone on the college lecture circuit in America. "I am hoping that
word will get around that I am a good speaker, and I might be able to
raise money through lecture tours as well," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Hollywood has also embraced her cause. Danny Glover, Matt Damon
and several other celebrities held a screening of "My Khmer Heart"
and a silent auction at the Directors Guild of America last month.
Currently, a celebrity auction for the orphanage is taking place at
www.cambodianheart.org.</TE>
<TE>   It has been estimated that more than 500,000 children were
orphaned during the genocide of Cambodia's Khmer Rhouge regime of the
1970s, and the country has been mired in poverty and political
instability ever since. Several of the Sunrise children lost their
parents to civil war, while others were given up because families no
longer could take care of them.</TE>
<TE>   Cox was never able to have children. Thirty years ago, she adopted
a Cambodian orphan baby, Lisa, who was later diagnosed as both
mentally and physically challenged. When Lisa was 7, Cox realized she
couldn't care for her daughter properly.</TE>
<TE>   "She's in Australia," she said quietly. "I haven't seen her for
two years because I need a bottle of gin and tonic to prepare myself
before I go see her. I have never been able to accept the fact she
doesn't know who I am. So I need to get myself pretty pickled before
I go. The people who take care of her, I am in touch with them all
the time. I am very fragile when I go visit her."</TE>
<TE>   A heartbreaking sequence in the documentary shows a widow giving
Cox her three young daughters because she can't afford to keep them.
Cox acknowledged identifying with the woman because of her experience
with Lisa.</TE>
<TE>   "I reached the stage where I couldn't provide the right care, so I
pulled myself together and found people who could take care of her,"
Cox said. "This woman had also reached the end of her ability to care
for her kids properly. It wasn't through her lack of love--it was the
opposite. So when I hugged that woman, I really knew what she was
feeling."</TE>

<HD>Soulfly, Static-X: From Primitive to Futuristic</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LINA LECARO</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Mega-tours such as the Ozzfest and Family Values have helped bring
heavier music to the forefront in rock, but those super-sized
showcases don't always allow aggressive bands to shine.</LD>
<LD>   After several hours of pummeling noise, it's often hard to
distinguish each group's strengths and nuances.</LD>
<LD>   Thankfully, this wasn't the case with Ozzfest alums Static-X and
Soulfly on Friday at the Hollywood Palladium.</LD>
<TE>   Brazil's Soulfly and LA-based Static-X showed range Friday,
sonically and thematically, perhaps more than any other two bands of
this ilk could. The former, led by Max Cavalera (formerly of
Sepultura) offered an intensely rhythmic, raw sound and almost tribal
quality that seemed to possess the crowd from the moment the group
began its set with the fittingly titled "Back to the Primitive."</TE>
<TE>   Static-X went for a more futuristic vibe, with electronic loops
and samples providing the foundation for its manic instrumentation.
The industrial-looking set created the perfect otherworldly backdrop
for the freaky-haired quartet's Ministry-like cyber-grooves and
cartoonish personas.</TE>
<TE>   Selections from its debut album, "Wisconsin Death Trip," were
potent and meticulous, but the material from its latest, "Machine,"
showed off its brutal techno-terror rock best--especially the title
track and the gloomy drone of the album's standout tune "Cold."</TE>
<TE>   Both bands put in strong performances heightened by guest
appearances from members of the ferocious Fear Factory, who meshed
well with the organic and synthetic inclinations of each, and
confirmed that whether it's driven by primal or digital
undercurrents, modern metal's common thread seems to be a relentless
rage that never goes away.</TE>

<LD>Rarely has the message from Hollywood hit us so clearly.</LD>
<LD>   Once you see a person with mental retardation portrayed as
accurately and positively as in the recently released movie "I Am
Sam," you can only conclude that society has come a long way.</LD>
<LD>   When is the last time you saw a movie that focuses around the life
of a person with a developmental disability? Sure, there was Tom
Hanks in "Forrest Gump," Dustin Hoffman in "Rain Man" and Leonardo
DiCaprio in "What's Eating Gilbert Grape." But when is the last time
the main character was not seen as a misfit? When was the last time
an individual with a mental disability was shown holding a job,
socializing with his friends and being a part of society?</LD>
<TE>   Keep in mind that until the 1970s, people with mental retardation,
autism, cerebral palsy and other developmental disabilities were
literally warehoused in institutions. Parents were told upon the
birth of children with disabilities that there was no future for
these youngsters and it was best to forget about them. So, of course,
in 1988 we saw Hoffman playing the role of Raymond, a man with autism
who had been in an institution and was totally dependent on his
brother. Moreover, the character seemed to encompass virtually every
stereotype of a person with autism.</TE>
<TE>   Today, in "I Am Sam," Sean Penn plays Sam Dawson, a father with
mental retardation raising his young daughter, Lucy, who is
developing typically and whose cognitive abilities are rapidly
eclipsing those of her father.</TE>
<TE>   A single parent struggling to raise a child is not unusual for
Hollywood. A single parent with a cognitive disability struggling to
raise a child? That's groundbreaking!</TE>
<TE>   Every new parent, regardless of race, creed, color or economic
conditions, enters his or her role a novice. We buy books on
parenting. We watch tapes and talk shows. We speak to "specialists."
Not long ago, I was a little taken aback when a friend told me about
the parent support group she was attending every week in New York
City. When I asked what kind of support they were seeking, she said,
"Oh, you know, just all the usual things we have absolutely no idea
how to deal with."</TE>
<TE>   At one time or another, everyone needs support--whether it is from
a neighbor, friend, family member, pediatrician or social service
agency. Everyone seeks help, whether it is from a $150-an-hour child
psychiatrist or our own mother.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm smart enough to know when I need help, I ask for it," a
46-year-old mother with a learning disability told me recently. She
receives support from a parents-with-special-needs program. If she
needs help with parenting skills of any kind, a parent counselor is
just a call away. If she feels frustrated, she attends the program's
parents support group.</TE>
<TE>   As the movie points out, being a loving parent has little to do
with educational diplomas, bank accounts or job titles. Michelle
Pfeiffer plays the role of Rita, Sam's pro-bono attorney, and her
character and lifestyle are sharply drawn to contrast with Sam's
situation in life. She has all the trappings of affluence and success
but excruciatingly little time to sit down and just "be" with her
son. Sam is a busboy at Starbucks. His job in no way appears to
compromise the quality time that he spends with his daughter. The
camera lingers on them swinging together in the sun, enjoying a meal,
or curling up in bed reading. These are wonderful, physically warm
moments. There's little price to these moments, just time well spent.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   In one critical scene of the movie, Sam is questioned by state
agency officials about why he thinks he has the ability to be a
father. He responds, "It's about constancy and it's about patience.
And it's about listening and it's about pretending to listen when you
can't listen any more, and it's about love." In the case of parents
with special needs, we must provide the kind of support services that
will offer practical help and an ear to listen. Parents with special
needs benefit from help with tutoring, after-school activities,
transportation, budgeting money and, like every parent in the
universe, a little baby-sitting now and then.</TE>
<TE>   I can count on one hand the number of programs that I know of to
help these parents. It is my hope that with the national release of
this provocative movie, every state funder for social services will
see this need and respond with sensitive and creative programs.</TE>
<TE>   The bottom line to the story of Sam and Lucy is that no loving
parent and child should be separated because social services are not
available.</TE>
<TE>   "Everyone needs to understand that persons with disabilities have
needs and desires just like everyone else," the parent with a
disability explained. "They need to take care of someone and love
someone else."</TE>
<TE>   Her words seem obvious. But how many of us thought about parents
with special needs before seeing "I Am Sam"? Hollywood thought about
it. And Hollywood gets it.</TE>

<HD>Ailey II Adds Physical Prowess to Intricate Steps</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>VICTORIA LOOSELEAF</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Raising the bar for sheer physical prowess, Ailey II, the second
company of Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater, scorched the roof off
Pepperdine University's Smothers Theatre on Friday. Under Sylvia
Waters' direction, the dozen dancers proved indefatigable, virtuosic
and relentlessly sexy in an eight-part program that included three
works new to Southern California.</LD>
<LD>   Terrence A. Poplar kicked things off in "Takademe." Choreographed
by Robert Battle and set to Sheila Chandra's  music--filled with
Indian dance rhythms--this playful solo allowed a shirtless,
loose-limbed Poplar ample opportunity for jumping splits,
head-bobbing and intricate hand gestures.</LD>
<LD>   Think Kathak on speed.</LD>
<TE>   In Darrell Grand Moultrie's "Aspects of a Vibe," the ensemble made
good use of Carl Craig's remix of Tito Puente's Latin jazz music--a
buoyant Holly Hyman oozed heat; Jamar Roberts astonished with
pretzel-like contortions; and Hanifa L. Jackson's impossibly long leg
extensions dazzled.</TE>
<TE>   Hyman also commanded the stage in Scott Rink's "Full On Night," a
kind of surreal club scene in which the firebrand expressed heartache
and exaltation as she slithered to P.J. Harvey's rendition of Peggy
Lee's classic "Is That All There Is?"</TE>
<TE>   The carousel of bodies reached steamy heights as Michael Snipe Jr.
and Kanji Segawa helped complete the mating dance, with effortless
partnering.</TE>
<TE>   The oldies portion of the program held goodies as well.</TE>
<TE>   Excerpts from Ailey's choreographic masterpieces appeared as fresh
as ever: "Mean Ol' Frisco," from "Blues Suite," featured Snipe,
Segawa, Poplar, Kevin L. Goodwine and Prince C. Credell seemingly
defying gravity as they leapt across the stage with ease.</TE>
<TE>   Kristina Michelle Bethel was the picture of elegance in "Streams,"
and Roberts again proved uber-athletic in "Spirits Descending" from
"Hidden Rites."</TE>
<TE>   "Isba" showcased Brandye Ranarta Lee and a hip-swaying Segawa in
exquisite unison movements; "Escapades," set to music by Max Roach,
made for a jubilant finale, the Ailey II company purring like a
well-oiled machine.</TE>

<KH>THE OSCARS</KH>
<HD>The New Bleacher Features</HD>
<DH>Fans will be subjected to stricter guidelines this year,
including advance reservations for seats and background checks.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LORENZA MUNOZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Yes, there will still be bleachers for fans at this year's Academy
Awards--despite earlier rumors that they would be banned. But getting
a bleacher seat will be much tougher than before, and don't plan to
camp out ahead of time to get one.</LD>
<LD>   The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences will announce
today that it is implementing stricter procedures to determine who
can watch the celebrity arrivals from the bleachers at the 74th
annual Academy Awards, which this year moves to its new home in
Hollywood at the Kodak Theatre.</LD>
<LD>   For the last few months, fans and industry people alike have
speculated that the academy would ban the bleachers because of
concerns about security and traffic around the new site. Fans will
still be able to catch a glimpse of their favorite stars from the
bleachers, academy officials said. But the days of fans camping out
at the Oscar site days in advance in hopes of getting a bleacher seat
on Oscar Sunday are over.</LD>
<TE>   This year, fans will have bleacher seats by advance reservation
only. They must submit an application including their name, passport
and Social Security numbers, and agree to be subject to a background
check. Once fans have been vetted, they will be assigned seats.</TE>
<TE>   Fans will also be subjected to a metal detector test--don't feel
bad, the stars must go through one as well--and wear an
identification badge with their photograph. The applications will be
available beginning Wednesday on the academy's Web site,
www.oscars.org.</TE>
<TE>   "The prevailing wisdom here is that these folks are such an
important part of the event we wanted to keep them," said Ric
Robertson, the academy's executive administrator.</TE>
<TE>   The bleachers will be on the north side of Hollywood Boulevard
next to the Kodak Theatre, which is part of the new Hollywood &amp;
Highland complex. About 400 bleacher seats will be available, the
same as in past years. The red carpet for celebrities and guests will
run down Hollywood Boulevard outside the theater.</TE>
<TE>   The relocation of the Oscars to the Kodak Theatre brings the
industry's most important awards show to its fabled home, but it has
also created some logistical challenges. The outside site is smaller
than the Oscars' former homes, the Shrine Auditorium and the Dorothy
Chandler Pavilion. All businesses near the Kodak Theatre will be
closed March 24, the date of the ceremony. And nearby residents will
be subjected to closed street traffic for several days before the
ceremony.</TE>
<TE>   In years past, seats on the bleachers were given on a first-come,
first-served basis. To get seats, fans would set up "tent cities"
outside the bleacher site, three or four days before the ceremony.
This year, the city of Los Angeles has yet to determine whether it
will allow people to camp out to line the streets as the celebrities
arrive, said Robertson. But in discussions with the merchants, it was
made clear that they did not want the fans staked out in front of
their stores.</TE>
<TE>   "Some of the neighbors haven't exactly been thrilled with having
their sidewalk turn into tent city," Robertson said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The academy's decision to keep the bleachers will surely bring
relief to the legions of celebrity spectators who make the trek to
the Oscar site every year. The academy decided that it could not do
away with the frenetic energy that excitable fans create for the
stars on the red carpet. It is a tradition as wedded to the Oscars as
thanking agents and dressing in designer gowns.</TE>
<TE>   Whether it was Clark Gable waving at his adoring fans in the '30s,
soldiers saluting the stars during World War II or an unknown starlet
losing her slip and throwing it to the crowds in the '50s, the
bleachers have always been a focal point for celebrity worship at
Hollywood's most glamorous event--and one of the most-watched
televised events in the world.</TE>
<TE>   One of the only notable contretemps in the bleachers was in 1996,
when director Milos Forman was nominated for "The People vs. Larry
Flynt," and protesters infiltrated the bleachers holding signs
against pornography. Any real protests over the years--such as during
the Vietnam War, the 1996 Jesse Jackson-led protest against the lack
of minority representation in Hollywood, or opposition to director
Elia Kazan receiving an honorary Oscar in 1999--have been held
outside the bleacher area, usually far from cameras and reporters.</TE>
<TE>   "Very little has transpired on the bleachers in terms of drama,"
said Oscar historian Damien Bona, author of "Inside Oscar 2: A Year
by Year History of the Oscars." "People who are willing to wait a
couple of days in line are usually not very political."</TE>
<TE>   And perhaps nothing represents the era of celebrity worship more
than the 400 people who have traveled from all over the world to
catch a momentary glimpse of a movie star.</TE>
<TE>   Their enthusiasm for the celebrities is something the stars
themselves are prepped for by the publicists who walk them down the
red carpet. The shouts, clapping and buzzing from the fans in the
bleachers, along with the flashes from the paparazzi, make for a
frenzied environment that gets the stars hyped.</TE>
<TE>   "I told Juliette Binoche, 'When you get there and they recognize
you, it will be like nothing you have ever seen or heard or felt,'"
said Melody Korenbrott, head of Block Korenbrott PR, describing the
deafening noise and blinding flashes on the red carpet. "I told her,
'Enjoy it.' It's a once-in-a-lifetime experience for some people."</TE>

<HD>Jay Farrar Sticks to the Same Moody Melodies</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NATALIE NICHOLS</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As cult heroes go, singer-songwriter Jay Farrar is pretty reliable.
During his Knitting Factory performance Saturday, his current work
proved cut from the same moody, bucolic cloth as the pioneering
alt-country material he crafted with high school pal Jeff Tweedy in
Uncle Tupelo and later as the leader of Son Volt.</LD>
<LD>   With Son Volt on indefinite hiatus, Farrar released his solo
debut, "Sebastopol," last fall. The collection evoked his trademark
Byrds/Neil Young-esque minor-key, alternately tuned,
close-harmonized, guitar-based introspection.</LD>
<LD>   But it also continued where Son Volt left off, adding instrumental
colors and sonic effects to inject variety into his songs, which tend
to return often to little-guy matters of work and love, while also
ruminating on history and evoking a general sense of yearning.</LD>
<TE>   The album does this in a pleasantly low-key fashion, thanks to
subtle trip-hop-esque production elements and contributions from such
guests as vocalist Gillian Welch, guitarist David Rawlings and the
Flaming Lips' Steven Drodze on keyboards.</TE>
<TE>   But Farrar's 90-plus-minute Saturday set, though certainly
satisfying to the faithful, was not as successful. This was partly
because Farrar was accompanied only by his own acoustic guitar and
the versatile playing of guitarist-keyboardist Mark Spencer (formerly
of Blood Oranges).</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, Spencer's inventive slide work and evocative lap-steel
playing helped make the material about as interesting as it could
have been.</TE>
<TE>   The pair harmonized quite fetchingly, but although Farrar's wry
"Barstow" and exuberant, almost poppy "Voodoo Candle" stood out, too
often his tunes struck similar emotional notes.</TE>
<TE>   They mixed things up with outside selections, including Uncle
Tupelo material, but even an encore rendition of the Beatles' "Within
You, Without You" offered only momentary respite from the drone.</TE>
<TE>   Jay Farrar, with Brian Henneman, plays Tuesday at the Coach House,
33157 Camino Capistrano, San Juan Capistrano, 8 p.m. $15. (949)
496-8930.</TE>

<HD>Eddy Arnold Looks Back, With Love</HD>
<DH>Pop Music * In choosing vintage cuts for a new collection,
the country legend singles out 'songs to fall in love to.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JIM PATTERSON</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>NASHVILLE</DL>
<LD>When Eddy Arnold ambles through the offices of RCA Records, staffers
sit up and take notice.</LD>
<LD>   But when he was addressed as "Mr. Arnold" on a recent visit, the
83-year-old singer deflected the deference to his place in country
music history by suggesting a game of craps.</LD>
<LD>   "I've had a long, long career, and I'm an old man," said Arnold,
whose hits include classic recordings such as "I'll Hold You in My
Heart (Till I Can Hold You in My Arms)" and "Cattle Call."</LD>
<TE>   He began his career at Victor (later called RCA) before most
workers in the building were born. He was managed by Col. Tom Parker
before Parker went on to guide Elvis Presley's career.</TE>
<TE>   Arnold sang with the Pee Wee King band in the early 1940s, scoring
his first solo hit in 1945, "Each Minute Feels Like a Million Years."</TE>
<TE>   His nickname was "The Tennessee Plowboy" until the mid-1950s,
because of his farming background. But his style was relaxed enough
that when the Nashville Sound era of lush strings and background
vocalists came along, he was one of the first to adapt.</TE>
<TE>   For his latest album, "Looking Back," he has selected "songs to
fall in love to, with romantic strings." (He's been married to Sally
Arnold for more than 60 years.) The collection will be released
Tuesday, in time for Valentine's Day.</TE>
<TE>   The songs on the new CD date back to the 1960s, when Arnold
revitalized his career by adding strings. It was a controversial move
for a country artist.</TE>
<TE>   "Everybody thinks they know more about your business than you do,"
he said. "What happened to me was, I'd been going along having hit
after hit after hit after hit. Then, as time goes by, you get cold.</TE>
<TE>   "I got to thinking, if I just took the same kind of songs I'd been
singing and added violins to them, I'd have a new sound. They cussed
me, but the disc jockeys grabbed it.... The artists began to say,
'Aww, he's left us.' Then within a year, they were doing it!"</TE>
<TE>   Now, as the cycle repeats itself, hits by artists such as Arnold
and Patsy Cline are considered classics, while traditionalists
grumble about the crossover hits of Faith Hill and Shania Twain.</TE>
<TE>   Arnold grew up in rural western Tennessee, a fan of Jimmie Rodgers
and Gene Autry. He also admired smooth pop vocalists such as Bing
Crosby and Perry Como.</TE>
<TE>   "Bing was such a talent, such a talent," Arnold said. "He would
sing anything. A lot of people now don't realize how many country
songs he did. He'd take a country song, and he'd do a pop version of
it, but he'd do it straight. He didn't make fun of it."</TE>
<TE>   Arnold proved a savvy businessman, buying up real estate around
Nashville that he still owns.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't drink as much as a lot of people did then," he offers as
explanation. "I won't call names.</TE>
<TE>   "Also, I was a product of the Depression. I did hard labor. I used
to cut logs, cut crossties. That's hard work. Once I got started in
this music business, I had an idea that if I'm going to earn that
money, I want to wind up with some of it. But really, I minded my
business because I wasn't busy drinking like a lot of people did
then."</TE>
<TE>   Arnold was elected to the Country Music Hall of Fame in 1966, and
named entertainer of the year by the Country Music Assn. the next
year. The hits continued until 1982, an impressive 37-year run that
produced 29 No. 1 singles. He's sold more than 80 million records.</TE>
<TE>   The selections on "Looking Back" include hits, and album cuts that
fit the theme. Among them are Arnold's versions of Glen Campbell's
"Gentle on My Mind," Bobby Goldsboro's "Honey" and Roger Miller's
"Little Green Apples."</TE>
<TE>   The key is romance and love.</TE>
<TE>   "I was reaching for that at this stage of my life," he said.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>As announced, the Chilingirian Quartet's program at Glendale's Alex
Theatre on Saturday night was to have been a more or less traditional
string quartet trilogy--Haydn, Bartok and Beethoven.</LD>
<LD>   But perhaps with an eye toward Glendale's large, loyal Armenian
community, first violinist Levon Chilingirian--who is of Armenian
extraction--decided late in the game to swap Bartok's Quartet No. 5
for some local color from the old country: a selection of seven
rarely played Komitas folk song settings as transcribed for quartet
by Sarkis Aslamazian.</LD>
<LD>   Evidently, word didn't get out in time; attendance was sparse. But
those who came heard some delightful music--a gentle dance, a
mournful waltz-like tune, ghostly apparitions, and always, very
attractive melodies with distinctive descending harmonies that many
of us probably first encountered in the music of Khachaturian.</LD>
<TE>   The big, ceaselessly inspired, radically structured Beethoven
Quartet No. 14 in C-sharp minor, Opus 131, receives fewer
performances than most of its brethren.</TE>
<TE>   Music appreciation "experts" used to give this work a fearsome
reputation, which is nonsense; the piece has immediate ear appeal
through all its stream-of-consciousness twists and turns, and
questions with no answers.</TE>
<TE>   The Chilingirians must love it, too; they leaned into the music
with a swiftly paced ardor that suggested great affection. Perhaps
the lengthy central andante frayed a bit in concentration, and the
ensemble got rougher in the finale, after 35 continuous minutes of
playing. But the sharp rhythmic attacks of the finale and the
mischievous quality of the Presto movement were right on the dot.</TE>
<TE>   At the top of the evening, the Chilingirians displayed robust,
hearty, warm tone quality in Haydn's Quartet in D, Opus 71, No. 2,
giving the rhythms of the Menuetto a rustic flavor.</TE>

<HD>This Music Gets Her Jazzed</HD>
<DH>Trisha Brown again transforms the mundane into something
fresh and intense as she seeks choreographic equivalents to American
jazz in 'El Trilogy.' The result is brainy yet, ultimately,
unrestrained.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LEWIS SEGAL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Postmodern pioneer Trisha Brown has been an innovator since the early
1960s, but "El Trilogy" represents a new challenge for her at age 65.
As seen Friday at Royce Hall, in the "UCLA Live" season, this
full-evening plotless work is her first choreography to jazz, and she
not only uses the music as an accompaniment to her typically
loose-limbed, freewheeling movement, but inventively reflects its
forms, moods and origins in American popular culture.</LD>
<LD>   Working with a complex score by jazz composer and trumpeter Dave
Douglas (played live in some engagements, on tape at UCLA), Brown
gives her nine-member cast energetic loops and swirls akin to those
on the black-and-white backdrop by painter Terry Winters that
dominates Section 1, "Five Part Weather Invention." The dancing
remains fast, steady and remarkably supple here, marked by a very
full use of the body, but often following an impulse generated in the
arms.</LD>
<LD>   Soon an undulating, nine-member line forms, front to back, with
individuals strolling out of formation to do a step or strike a pose,
then sashaying back. A follow-the-leader structure develops, much
like those of classic line dances in early jazz clubs, but not only
does Stacy Matthew Spence lead the others in playful gesture games,
he also initiates an elaborate bounding/dodging sequence with brief
duets that leads to one of Brown's most daring and central
strategies.</LD>
<TE>   Hearing the musicians' coughs and other random noises on the
soundtrack, Brown wants to punctuate her dance passages with what we
might call documentary motion. So she asks her dancers to
periodically fall--suddenly, heavily--as if by accident, and this
startling motif undermines the conventional unisons on view and gives
them an edge.</TE>
<TE>   After "Five Part Weather Invention" ends, the backdrop ascends and
stagehands reset lights and anchor a column of nine gleaming cymbals
in place. Against their non-dance tasks, Brown sets a dramatic solo
for Mariah Maloney, a passage full of intense lunges, ending with her
hands clawing the floor.</TE>
<TE>   Later, during the set-change between parts 2 and 3, Maloney will
perform another solo, this one creatively exploring the possibilities
of an aluminum stepladder as a dance partner. Embracing and
transforming the mundane has been a career-long preoccupation for
Brown, and "El Trilogy" attacks the concept again with great
freshness.</TE>
<TE>   Titled "Rapture to Leon James" in tribute to a Lindy Hop icon,
Section 2 chops up social dance moves and reassembles them in
surprising new patterns. Staged against the bold color washes of
lighting designer Jennifer Tipton, the high-speed discontinuities
here--kicking, twisting, shuffling, finger-snapping--make a brilliant
showpiece and remind you of Igor Stravinsky's dissections of popular
and folk music. But as Douglas' musical line splinters toward the
end, some of the weakest, most aimlessly frenetic dancing of the
night takes place. Brown recoups with a final cavalcade of blues
stances, show-dance formations, tap attacks and ballroom images, but
as a whole "Rapture" proves uneven and forced.</TE>
<TE>   "Groove and Countermove," however, features a series of inspired
playoffs and even finds room for stillness, a concept that played no
part in "Rapture." It also features another Winters backdrop--this
one a suite of two dozen miniature squares laid out in a grid.</TE>
<TE>   Beginning with a genial extended duet for Katrina Thompson and
Brandi Norton, the choreography quickly settles into the role of
matchmaker, uniting opposites with dazzling surety. Rigorously
composed formal movement connects to passages of jabbing, bobbing,
head-wagging spontaneity, and somehow Brown makes the two belong
together, just as she alternates solos and ensembles, swirling and
stationary passages, liquid and spiky dynamics.</TE>
<TE>   It's a great juggling act, and it honors the blend of freedom and
discipline, instinct and technique, of great jazz playing. As the
music heats up in the final moments, the dancers are continually
swept up in larger and larger groupings until all nine collapse on
their sides at the extreme right with the impact of one last,
definitive crash of cymbals.</TE>
<TE>   You could argue that much of "El Trilogy" seems far too
intellectualized for ideal jazz dancing, and that Brown needs to let
go and just groove long before her engulfing finale. But her brainy
approach succeeds in making you think about what you're hearing--the
disparate skills, traditions and kinds of attack involved--in order
to make sense of what you're seeing.</TE>
<TE>   From its start, postmodernism prioritized thinking differently
about dance, and "El Trilogy" not only renews that sense of mission
but encourages you to think differently about music.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to the dancers previously mentioned, the Trisha Brown
Dance Company includes Abigail Yager, Sandra Grinberg, Seth Parker,
Lionel Popkin and Todd Stone.</TE>

<HD>Many Sides to Tale of Show-Biz Twins</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DON SHIRLEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The title of the powerful "Side Show" is appropriately
double-layered. The musical's protagonists, Daisy and Violet, are
forever side by side, as Siamese twins joined at the hip. And they're
discovered in a tawdry, Depression-era side show.</LD>
<LD>   In the course of the musical, they join classier show business
circles, yet they learn that it's impossible to fully transcend their
roots.</LD>
<LD>   When the musical opened on Broadway in 1997, its creators may have
felt the same way. Their show was in the shadow of "The Lion King,"
which opened at about the same time. "Side Show" lost a lot of money.</LD>
<TE>   Now in Southern California, an area where theater is much less
commercially oriented, "Side Show" feels like a main event. For the
nonprofit Colony Theatre at the mid-size Burbank Center Stage, it
should be a thundering success.</TE>
<TE>   It's hardly a side show in spirit. Daisy and Violet are presented
as individuals who must cope with the elusive concepts of how to
define themselves and their ties to other human beings. These are not
esoteric subjects. The women's position is a graphic metaphor for
universal human concerns.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, in his quest to portray these women fully,
librettist-lyricist Bill Russell may have gone a little too far in
creating our initial impression of them. In the context of the
blighted circumstances in which we find them, their good-natured
resilience seems almost super-human.</TE>
<TE>   However, we soon learn that they have issues dividing them. Daisy
wants to be famous; Violet wants a husband and children. They
sometimes get on each other's nerves--a dilemma encapsulated in the
amusingly jaunty "Leave Me Alone."</TE>
<TE>   Russell tells their story simply, allowing the ironies and the
larger metaphor to emerge without forcing the issue. Henry Krieger's
music supports the story's contours with agility and passion.</TE>
<TE>   Nick DeGruccio's staging honors the creators' aims. Bradley Kaye's
set is largely abstract and highly mobile so that attention remains
on Daisy and Violet and the men in their lives. Occasionally
DeGruccio uses the aisles to bring the audience even closer.</TE>
<TE>   Julie Dixon Jackson's Daisy and Misty Cotton's Violet have facial
features that are as easily distinguishable as their goals. Their
singing voices, however, sound similar and equally strong. It's
hardly credible that even someone as craven as their side show boss
(Todd Nielsen, with a five o'clock shadow) would describe their
untrained singing as "screeching."</TE>
<TE>   The women move in a way that never violates their physical
deformity but also shows how they've mastered the limited flexibility
that's available to them.</TE>
<TE>   The two men who take them away from the side show are equally
well-drawn. Buddy, who discovers the women and finds himself
especially interested in Violet, is portrayed by Mark W. Smith as an
awfully nice guy who realizes too late that "nice" isn't always
enough. His voice is on the light side, befitting Buddy's
personality.</TE>
<TE>   By contrast, Kevin Earley's Terry Connor, the impresario who's
attracted to Daisy, is--despite his smooth veneer--in closer touch
with his emotions. "Private Conversation" is a rich showcase for
Earley's often electrifying voice. The evening's most introspective
showstopper, it evolves into a sensual duet with Jackson.</TE>
<TE>   David Jennings plays a fellow side show freak who's also in love
with Violet but finds himself at a disadvantage in her eyes because
of his race, a development that adds a poignant twist to the story.
Jennings has a fierce presence and a big voice that sounded slightly
strained on opening night.</TE>
<TE>   Tom Griffin directs a lively band above the stage on the
audience's left, and the carny heritage of A. Jeffrey Schoenberg's
costumes adds dashes of color to this vivid tale.</TE>

<DH>L.A. Opera looks to provocative Achim Freyer for staging of
Bach's Mass in B minor.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARK SWED</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>J.S. Bach, a sensible man and singularly rational composer, had no
place in his life for opera, no calling for the stage. But the stage
has repeatedly called for his music. His cantatas and passions have
been dramatized by modern directors. Bach has been background for
dance, for theater, for cinema.</LD>
<LD>   Now Los Angeles Opera has mounted a production of the Mass in B
minor. To put a mass on the lyric stage is a moderately eccentric
undertaking for any opera company, slightly more so for a young one
that has still but scraped the surface of the conventional operatic
repertory. But masses are ritual, ritual is stage-worthy, and Achim
Freyer's stunning production of the B-minor mass unveiled Saturday
afternoon at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion is altogether mesmeric.</LD>
<LD>   It is also, for this young company, a coup. Although a major
figure in German theater, opera and the visual arts, Freyer's stage
work in America has not been seen other than his startlingly
seductive designs for Schoenberg's "Moses and Aron" in a production
at New York City Opera more than a decade ago. San Francisco Opera
has announced a long-famed Freyer production of Carl Maria von
Weber's "Der Freischutz" from Stuttgart for the season after next.</LD>
<TE>   There are reasons why Freyer's work has not been welcomed on
American stages. It is wild; it is obscure; it is prohibitively
expensive (requiring extensive rehearsal time); and it sometimes
angers. A couple of years ago at the Salzburg Festival, I feared that
the fuming audience was ready to slit Freyer's throat because of a
new staging that turned the "The Magic Flute" into a circus of
clowns. But in subsequent seasons, this sublime production became a
hit.</TE>
<TE>   Freyer can also be frustratingly uneven. In the 1980s at Stuttgart
Opera, this painter and former associate of Bertolt Brecht mounted
his version of a Philip Glass opera trilogy that included exuberantly
fantastical and unforgettably beautiful productions of "Satyagraha"
(finally released last month on DVD) and "Akhnaten," along with his
own Postmodern deconstruction of the already Pomo deconstructivist
"Einstein on the Beach," which reduced it to an arduous charade of
abstract movement and surreal characters floating in space discussing
philosophy.</TE>
<TE>   The Mass in B minor, created for the Schwetzingen Festival in
1996, is the successful son of this "Einstein" in that it, too, is a
study in abstract movement, and seeks no immediately recognizable
visual corollaries to the text. The design--a schematic head painted
on the scrim, various drawings of body parts scattered about the
stage--appears to be that of a Pomo Leonardo. In interviews, Freyer
has explained that, for him, Bach's mass represents the anatomy of
the human soul.</TE>
<TE>   The set is a cube, surrounded by black, spectacularly lit in
glowing colors, with images magically appearing and disappearing on
scrims. Freyer's style tends to be to reduce whatever text he is
working with to an essential concept (here the dissociated, eyes,
ears, arms, feet) and then to mess things up, often with brash, bold,
painterly gestures, which can include flamboyant cartoons. Letters
and numbers often appear on Freyer's sets, and they do here as well.</TE>
<TE>   Relegating chorus and solo singers to the pit with the orchestra,
Freyer enacts the drama he feels in Bach's music with nine members of
his own ensemble. These shadowy, shrouded, vaguely post-apocalyptic
figures with bulbous shoes suggest Giacometti sculptures come to
life. They hobble on stage like the walking dead, twitter like
machines, fall into ball-like clumps. Acrobats, they assume
impossible postures. They stand in a row, arms moving like Shiva as
Swiss Army knife. It is a ritual world in which we enter and get
lost. Fall for it, and you may never want to leave.</TE>
<TE>   The musical performance added its own curiosities. The
tenor-turned-conductor and Bach specialist, Peter Schreier conducted
a chamber-size Los Angeles Opera orchestra and chorus. The
instruments were modern, but Schreier's approach featured the quick
tempos and clipped articulation advocated by authorities in early
music performance practices.</TE>
<TE>   The playing and singing was light, with dancing rhythms, all
impressively demonstrating the heartening improvement of orchestra
and chorus.</TE>
<TE>   Bach's mass is essentially a choral work, with the occasional aria
or duet, and some opera-goers are likely to feel shortchanged by
having four young German singers--soprano Simone Nold, alto
Annekathrin Laabs, tenor Marcus Ullmann and baritone Stephan
Loges--not only hidden in the pit but also acoustically remote. At
least from a seat in the orchestra section (the sound from the pit
tends to rise more efficiently to the balconies), these singers
sounded distant and small-voiced, their individual roles approaching
accompaniment.</TE>
<TE>   That, for some opera-goers, may be too high a price to pay for
this arresting theatrical experiment. I thought I heard a boo or two
(boos and bravos can sound oddly alike), but most of the audience
Saturday seemed riveted by the experience. I have never sat among a
Los Angeles Opera audience so quiet, so focused, so continuously rapt
in its attention. And I hope as word gets around about this
production, it widens the scope of opera going. Anyone who cares
about music, dance, theater, the visual arts, the elevation of the
spirit or the divine made manifest has reason to visit the Music
Center.</TE>

<LD>"Bertie &amp; Elizabeth" is a royal portrait--occasionally vivid, but
more often formal and stiff--of the late King George VI and his wife,
the woman who would come to be known as the queen mother.</LD>
<LD>   "Masterpiece Theatre" is presenting the two-hour film tonight (at
9 on KCET) as part of PBS' programming to celebrate the 50th
anniversary of the accession of Queen Elizabeth II, the first-born
daughter of the title couple.</LD>
<LD>   Although it opens in 1920 as a love story between Albert, the duke
of York (James Wilby), and commoner Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon (Juliet
Aubrey), "Bertie &amp; Elizabeth" is quickly enveloped by historical
events, which form the framework of this dramatization. The first of
these is the death of Bertie's father, King George V, which means
that Bertie's older brother, David, will become King Edward VIII.</LD>
<TE>   But, in what some have called the love story of the 20th century,
King Edward VIII (Charles Edwards) abdicates to marry the woman he
loves, American divorcee Wallis Simpson (Amber Rose Sealey). And that
thrusts Bertie and Elizabeth into a spotlight they never expected, as
king and queen of England.</TE>
<TE>   The first half of the film could just as easily be called "Bertie
&amp; Elizabeth &amp; David &amp; Wallis," for it spends a lot of time tracing
the latter pair's affair and its effects on the younger couple. It
also portrays Simpson and her lover in a rather harsh light,
certainly not with the romantic glow this story has been given in the
past.</TE>
<TE>   The rest of the film concerns itself largely with how Elizabeth
helps Bertie overcome his stuttering and, more important, how she
helps him and the rest of England persevere through World War II. But
there is little insight into the couple's personal life as they deal
with wartime events.</TE>
<TE>   It's also not clear, from the film or its introduction by series
host Russell Baker, what historical references the drama is based on,
only that its script was written by Nigel Williams. That, along with
a minor misquote of FDR's famous speech about Pearl Harbor and some
unconvincing accents for the American characters, makes "Bertie &amp;
Elizabeth" something less than a masterpiece.</TE>

<HD>New Flood Control Rules Muddy the Local Waters</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>D.J. WALDIE</AU>
<BD>D.J. Waldie is a city official in Lakewood, where he
lives. His most recent book is "Real City: Downtown Los Angeles
Inside/Out" (Angel City Press, 2001), in collaboration with Marissa
Roth.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Neither good science nor good technology exists today to test for or
remove all the possible contaminants flowing into the county-operated
flood control system from lawn watering and cars driving on city
streets.</LD>
<LD>   Yet cities throughout Los Angeles County are about to be hit with
a "storm water tax" of up to $53 billion over the next 10 years to
attempt what may be impossible--to make the waters of the Los Angeles
River fishable, swimmable and potentially drinkable.</LD>
<LD>   But should they be?</LD>
<TE>   What if the cost means less money for parks, police, housing and
community services?</TE>
<TE>   What if the cost of turning the Los Angeles River into a mountain
stream means severely degrading the quality of life in the small
cities along the river's banks?</TE>
<TE>   Neither the voters nor their elected city and county
representatives had the opportunity to have those questions answered
because the nine members of the Los Angeles Regional Water Quality
Control Board, all appointed by the governor, decided that these
questions don't matter.</TE>
<TE>   The board unanimously adopted in December a revised storm water
permit for most of the county's 84 cities that contains 44 new
quality standards.</TE>
<TE>   Meeting just one of them--a "total maximum daily load" for trash
in the flood control channel of "zero" by 2012--will cost county
taxpayers an estimated $1 billion.</TE>
<TE>   The cost for meeting this standard--and all the others--will be
covered by new city fees and user charges for property owners or will
be taken from municipal funds needed to maintain streets, pay for
police or keep community centers open.</TE>
<TE>   Some of the hardest-pressed cities in the state must remake their
budgets to become the Los Angeles regional board's enforcement arm.</TE>
<TE>   Maywood has a general fund budget of about $6 million. What part
of law enforcement in Maywood does the regional board consider
appropriate to cut in order to police storm drains?</TE>
<TE>   In Bell Gardens, enforcement efforts would be equal to 100% of the
city's recreation budget. In Huntington Park, it's at least 75%.</TE>
<TE>   Even worse, these cities face a grinding round of citizen lawsuits
under the federal Clean Water Act and fines of up to $27,500 a day if
they fail to comply with the board's mandates.</TE>
<TE>   Cities and the county can be sued even if they make good-faith
efforts to clean up storm water or if the experimental technologies
they use don't work.</TE>
<TE>   These costs didn't impress the members of the Los Angeles regional
board.</TE>
<TE>   One member waved off concerns, saying cities would find the money
somehow.</TE>
<TE>   In response to such indifference, the county, the city of Los
Angeles and most of the county's other cities have appealed the
regional board's storm water permit to the State Water Resources
Control Board.</TE>
<TE>   It may be too late, however, to rescue workable storm water
regulation from a future of unnecessary conflict and the expense of
the inevitable court cases.</TE>
<TE>   All this could have been avoided.</TE>
<TE>   We already have a model for negotiating environmental goals into
the operation of the flood control system.</TE>
<TE>   Five years ago, when the small cities of the southeast area of the
county were faced with the catastrophic failure of the local flood
control system, everyone--the county Public Works Department, the
cities, federal agencies and skeptical environmental
organizations--sat down (after initial conflict) to work out
solutions that restored flood protection and began the environmental
revival of the wastelands along the river's edge.</TE>
<TE>   With realistic goals, everyone at the table became an advocate for
both the efficient operation of the flood control system and the
riverside environment.</TE>
<TE>   The open space and recreation projects that came out of this
process are an integral part of the $100-million, state-funded
revitalization of the entire Los Angeles River.</TE>
<TE>   The give and take of negotiation won't satisfy environmental
absolutists, who are intolerant of less-than-perfect solutions, but
the State Water Resources Control Board should at least try.</TE>
<TE>   The state water board should halt the imposition of the regional
board's storm water tax and assert its leadership by joining with the
cities, the county and the environmental community in a collaborative
review of realistic, scientifically sound and environmentally just
goals for storm water quality.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Not to put any pressure on Dr. Thomas L. Garthwaite, who on Friday
started as director of Los Angeles County's beleaguered health
department, but here is what his immediate job description looks
like:</LD>
<LD>   * Find $100 million in savings.</LD>
<LD>   * Overcome union opposition, since finding those savings is going
to mean consolidating or even closing underused facilities, which in
turn will mean eliminating some jobs.</LD>
<TE>   * Don't cut services to the people whose lives depend on the
county--doctor of last resort for 2.5 million people without any
insurance and provider of half of all trauma care for rich and poor
alike.</TE>
<TE>   That's just the first nine months. After that, Garthwaite, the
former undersecretary of health for the U.S. Department of Veterans
Affairs, will have to persuade the federal government to change the
way it reimburses Los Angeles County for caring for the poor. Without
help, the county is going to have to make even more drastic cuts,
severely limiting the types of care it delivers and the number of
people it serves. One worst-case scenario would be to close county
hospitals altogether, potentially overwhelming private hospitals and
undermining the already fragile trauma care system. Everyone in the
county, with or without insurance, would feel the effects.</TE>
<TE>   Garthwaite takes over a county health department about to go
broke--again. A Clinton administration bailout in 1995 kept the
county on life support. But the plug gets pulled next year as the
federal funds start tapering off, leaving the county with a
$344-million shortfall in the 2004 fiscal year and a $688-million
deficit the year after that.</TE>
<TE>   The problem goes beyond what can be blamed on bungling bureaucrats
and turf-defending county supervisors, no matter how much either has
contributed to problems in the past. Los Angeles County has more
people without health insurance than any other county in the nation.
The vast majority work or are dependents of workers; about half of
the jobs in the county are in small companies that often don't
provide health insurance. These people make too much to qualify for
government programs like Medi-Cal or Healthy Families but not enough
to afford private insurance. When they get sick or injured, the
county picks up the tab. And between Proposition 13's restrictions on
raising taxes and the state Legislature's takeover of local revenues
beginning during the last recession, county government cannot by
itself keep up with the costs of caring for this ever-rising
population. What it needs from the state and federal governments, if
not more aid, is at least fewer strings and more flexibility.</TE>
<TE>   Garthwaite is no stranger to seemingly impossible causes. For
example, he got the labyrinthine veterans' network operating on the
same computer system. Accomplishing that in the L.A. County health
department, where patient records are for the most part still kept by
hand, would save millions of dollars now lost because of duplicated
services and missed reimbursements--and would improve patient care
too.</TE>
<TE>   Proving that the county is serious about doing its share is the
only way to convince the federal and state governments to do theirs.
Unlike at the Veterans Affairs Department, Garthwaite will not have
powerful lobbyists behind him. He will have only the poor--unless
every other county resident realizes that fixing this problem is not
just the right thing to do but the only way to keep the health care
system intact for everyone.</TE>

<HD>The Special Ed Conundrum</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Someday soon, on one of the Los Angeles Unified School District's
overcrowded, dilapidated campuses, a little girl in a portable
classroom will raise her hand for help with a math question but the
teacher will be busy attending to the special needs of a new
classmate. The new student may be blind or deaf or autistic. More
likely he will suffer from what is known as a "behavioral disorder."</LD>
<LD>   What's certain is that he, like the other 35,000 "disabled"
children that a federal order will "mainstream" from special-needs
schools into regular classes, will require more attention and
additional teaching skills. Also certain is that the district,
already strapped for cash and administrative competence, cannot add
this responsibility without subtracting from the education of the 19
or 29 other students in the class.</LD>
<LD>   This is the sad legacy of a district that did the wrong thing (by
failing for years to provide equal educational opportunities to
disabled students, who have as much right to reach their full
potential as any other student) and then (when challenged by angry
parents in a 1993 lawsuit filed by the American Civil Liberties
Union) took the expedient way out and adopted a federal consent
decree that was guaranteed to make matters worse.</LD>
<TE>   Make no mistake, studies show that most physically and
psychologically disabled students progress faster when they are
placed in at least some classes with nondisabled peers. But what
about the other students and the mainstream teachers? School
districts such as New York and San Francisco that are well ahead of
the LAUSD on mainstreaming have documented some unintended
consequences. Already overworked teachers bailing out of their
careers is one. Cost is another.</TE>
<TE>   The L.A. district currently spends more than $1 billion on its
86,000 special ed students, more than half of whom already attend
regular classes at least part of the time. That cost is about to get
much higher. Thousands of teachers will need training, and some who
don't want this particular challenge will quit. Principals, who have
too much on their plates already, will get another priority. Hundreds
of schools will require renovations. No one at district headquarters
knows how much all this will cost. What Supt. Roy Romer does know is
that the district doesn't have the money.</TE>
<TE>   Even before the state's current economic crisis, making the
required accommodations would have required the district to make
deep, painful cuts elsewhere. And, lest anyone need reminding, this
is a district that is already struggling to raise test scores while
cutting 17 school days from many students' academic calendars and
while following a year-round schedule in order to accommodate a
vastly swollen student population.</TE>
<TE>   The fact is, the district has no choice but to ease these disabled
students into the mainstream by the agreed-on deadline of 2006.</TE>
<TE>   As a stopgap reaction to this untenable situation, Romer needs to
lobby Washington harder. In 1975, when Congress passed the law that
now governs special education, it promised to provide 40% of the
additional expense. It now pays only about 12%. President Bush plans
to include an additional $1 billion for special education in his
proposed budget. The LAUSD alone could absorb that amount.</TE>
<TE>   Long-term, the district's only hope is to introduce the sorts of
sweeping reforms that will make the schools work for every
student--disabled or not. A well-conceived plan that considers the
needs of individual students in the context of the entire student
population could bolster disabled students' learning and enrich the
experience of those students whose only challenge is overcoming the
complexities of reading, writing and algebra.</TE>

<LD>Mike Tyson is a convicted rapist who now is under investigation in
Las Vegas in two cases of sexual assault. When Tyson is
angered--which doesn't take much--he becomes a wild man. He bites
people, in or out of the ring. Not even the libertarian state of
Nevada wants the proposed April 6 fight between Tyson and heavyweight
champion Lennox Lewis.</LD>
<LD>   The Nevada State Athletic Commission voted 4 to 1 last week to
deny Tyson a license. Now, Tyson's manager says he'd like to stage
the match at Los Angeles' Staples Center. Tim Leiweke, the arena's
president, said, "We would very much like to hold the fight here."
If, he added, the California State Athletic Commission grants Tyson a
license. A commission official said no license request had been
received but that if one is received it probably will be considered
at a special meeting. The officials shouldn't waste their time.
Californians don't want Tyson here. The commission should reject any
license application without debate.</LD>
<LD>   Tyson brushed off his January news conference brawl and the Nevada
rejection as "minor setbacks." If he tries to enter California, we
should send Shaquille O'Neal to meet him at the border. Tyson would
find out what a major setback is.</LD>

<LD>Steve Lopez quite correctly lays the blame for the conspiracy of
silence at the feet of those in the Catholic Church who have sought
to cover up and thereby abet the abhorrent crimes of sexual abuse by
priests ("Half Measures Won't Stop Molesting by Priests," Jan. 30).
However, as an adult survivor of childhood sexual abuse and a
Catholic, I think it is important to recognize that this sickness is
not about sex, celibate priests or Catholicism itself; it's about
power.</LD>
<LD>   Advocating for married priests is a canard that completely ignores
the fact that thousands of married heterosexual men molest boys every
year. These predators are teachers, politicians, blue- and
white-collar workers of every ethnicity.</LD>
<LD>   Just as we strive to overcome the knee-jerk bigotry that would
condemn all Muslims for terrorism, so should we recognize that 60
million American Catholics condemn and reject the actions of these
sexual predators and those who conspire to hide them.</LD>
<TE>   Chris Fuentes</TE>
<TE>   Cerritos</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Outrage over child molestation has resulted in a zero-tolerance
policy of molester databases, longer jail terms and even commitment
to psychiatric institutions. Yet molester priests have rarely been
prosecuted, and even more disturbing is the continued cover-up by the
church's leadership. Large civil settlements have done little to
discourage this behavior. More drastic action is needed.</TE>
<TE>   Cardinal Roger Mahony should be compelled to testify if and when
he had knowledge of priests molesting children. If he had knowledge,
failed to report these crimes to the proper authorities or put
additional children at risk by relocating molester priests without
warning the congregations, then he should be prosecuted to the full
extent of the law. If we hold the church leadership accountable you
can be assured those under their leadership will also be held
accountable.</TE>

<LD>Re "Bush Vows to Take War on Terror to Hostile Nations, Calls for
Unity," Jan. 30: After 1) opposing the Taliban many years before most
Americans had ever heard of it; 2) allowing the United States to use
its air space for attacking the Taliban; 3) providing crucial
intelligence on the Taliban and military aid to the Northern
Alliance, the dominant anti-Taliban force; 4) opening its roads and
ports on the Persian Gulf to humanitarian aid sent to the Afghan
people; 5) using its strong influence over the Northern Alliance to
help prevent failure of the international conference in Germany that
brought the present Afghan government to power; and 6) promising $560
million in aid to Afghanistan, Iran is now accused by President Bush
of being part of the "axis of evil."</LD>
<LD>   With such expressions of "gratitude" by the U.S., and given what
is being done to the Palestinian people by Israel, the U.S.'s closest
ally, is it still any wonder why the U.S. has no friend in the Middle
East? To find the axis of evil, we do not need to travel to the
Middle East. We can easily find it among the warmongers in the Bush
administration.</LD>

<HD>Religion Can Provoke Rage as Well as Rapture</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>DWIGHT FURROW</AU>
<BD>Dwight Furrow is a philosophy professor at San Diego
Mesa College.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>For much of humanity, religion offers solace, guidance and hope. Yet
the events of Sept. 11 reinforce the difficult truth that religious
fervor is often expressed through cataclysmic violence.</LD>
<LD>   A quick survey of current world conflict, from Palestine to
Kashmir to Sri Lanka, shows that much of it has a religious
component.</LD>
<LD>   History provides abundant examples as well, from the Crusades to
the missionary zeal of colonial expansion.</LD>
<TE>   A secure post-Sept. 11 future will be illusory without an honest
assessment of this troubling relation.</TE>
<TE>   Why do messages of peace and hope sometimes degenerate into mayhem
and slaughter?</TE>
<TE>   Since the terrorist attacks, scholars have flocked to the media to
argue that the current penchant for violence by some Muslims is
motivated by nonreligious factors, such as economic deprivation and
political resentment.</TE>
<TE>   Misreadings of the Koran rendered by maniacal political actors
rationalize this violence, which has little to do with core beliefs,
so we are told.</TE>
<TE>   Yet these accounts neither explain why religion is the common
denominator in so many violent episodes nor why religion is so easily
exploited by worldly discontent.</TE>
<TE>   The unpalatable truth is that religious violence can arise from
the very nature of religious belief and the hopes that it inspires.</TE>
<TE>   Most human beings concentrate their hopes on a stable and enduring
happiness, which earthly existence--with its suffering, uncertainty
and impermanence--cannot secure.</TE>
<TE>   Given our limited human capacities, only a belief in something of
unsurpassable perfection and transcendent power will sustain the hope
that goodness will prevail, come what may.</TE>
<TE>   For the most devout, religion is the only source of value,
enveloping all of life in the glory cast by the divine light. God is
experienced as pure and utterly distinct from the profane and
ordinary, promising total fulfillment but requiring total surrender
as well.</TE>
<TE>   This experience of purity, totality and perfection is the source
of religion's power and message of hope because it promises to
overcome any threat to an enduring happiness posed by earthly
existence.</TE>
<TE>   Tragically, this experience of divinity can provoke rage as well
as rapture.</TE>
<TE>   When compared with a god of perfection who is the source of all
value, all things not godlike can seem worthless and empty.</TE>
<TE>   It is a very short step to view nonbelievers or the impious as the
"other," so bereft of the qualities associated with the divine that
no value can be assigned to them, and so no moral objection prevents
their destruction.</TE>
<TE>   The very source of hope--belief in the perfection and ultimate
value of God--can be the source of the feelings and judgments that
lead to religious violence.</TE>
<TE>   Christian doctrine attempts to avoid this conclusion by
proclaiming God's love for all creatures, suggesting that all of
creation is part of the divine.</TE>
<TE>   Yet that hardly solves the problem of religious violence, because
such an unconditional love is attainable only by God. We humans,
being imperfect, fall far short and cannot see the contemptible as
anything but just contemptible.</TE>
<TE>   The logic of religious violence can be avoided only if the devout
see the secular world as having value that is independent of the
divine. The imperfections of the world must be viewed as problems to
solve rather than indignities to crush.</TE>
<TE>   Religious differences must be respected as private commitments of
conscience rather than pollutants to be purged.</TE>
<TE>   The vast majority of religious believers acknowledge the value of
the modern world and its secular institutions. A few do not, with
results that have become all too familiar.</TE>
<TE>   Hopes for peace in the Middle East and elsewhere rest on the
unqualified acceptance of secular governments with secular aims,
where conflicts over trade, resources and political power are
negotiable.</TE>
<TE>   The sacred cannot be bartered for something as profane as peace.</TE>

<HD>To Curb Terrorism, Send Aid in Abundance</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>WILLIAM F. SCHULZ</AU>
<BD>William F. Schulz is executive director of Amnesty
International USA and author of "In Our Own Best Interest: How
Defending Human Rights Benefits Us All" (Beacon Press, 2001).</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The recent decision by the United States to spend about $300 million
on Afghanistan reconstruction signals a welcome shift in attitude
toward foreign assistance.</LD>
<LD>   Throughout the 1990s, Americans expressed deep-seated ambivalence
about providing social and economic aid to developing countries.
While the number favoring such aid increased in the last half of the
decade, no doubt because of the perceptions of bounty generated by an
expanding economy, no more than 13% of Americans ever said the amount
of U.S. foreign aid should grow.</LD>
<LD>   Responding to that sentiment, the Bush administration proposed in
May to cut overseas refugee assistance by $5 million, even though the
number of refugees stood at an all-time high.</LD>
<TE>   Now the administration, quite appropriately, is taking the lead in
a global effort to rebuild Afghanistan. It is doing that not out of
the goodness of its heart but because it recognizes that a ravaged
country is ripe for instability and terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   What is true of Afghanistan is also true of other countries. Since
the 1993 debacle in Somalia, for example, Americans largely have
managed to put that country out of their minds, at least until a
popular book and movie--"Black Hawk Down"--returned it to our
attention. But Somalia is every bit as economically desperate a place
today, albeit a more peaceful one. That desperation contributes to
its susceptibility as a haven for terrorists. Yet U.S. aid to Somalia
has declined sharply since 1993, from $28million to $16 million
today.</TE>
<TE>   Whether it be the squalor of a refugee camp, the impoverishment of
an urban slum or the narrow-mindedness cultivated by hard-line
Islamic religious schools known as madrasas, social and economic ills
can come back to haunt those who ignore them, even if they live
thousands of miles away.</TE>
<TE>   It is true that much foreign assistance has been wasted over the
years, either as a result of corruption or poor planning. Yet we now
have the opportunity to accept as a cornerstone of our foreign policy
the fundamental principle that human beings who have access to
shelter, food, employment and education will be more content and less
likely to resort to violence. Some administration officials
understand this.</TE>
<TE>   "I really believe that creating jobs in [Pakistan] is a way to
protect American lives," said Wendy J. Chamberlin, U.S. ambassador to
that country. And in Nepal last month, Secretary of State Colin
Powell said U.S. aid could help counter Maoist violence in that
nation.</TE>
<TE>   At least two obstacles, however, threaten the prospect of a
renewed commitment to social and economic development around the
world.</TE>
<TE>   The first is that Americans historically have been opposed to the
recognition of social and economic rights internationally. We can
address social and economic deprivation on a case-by-case basis, but
until we recognize in a systemic way that poverty and ignorance make
victims of us all, we will never be entirely safe from their
consequences.</TE>
<TE>   The second obstacle is reflected in polls showing a rise in
sympathy for foreign assistance that paralleled the growth of a more
robust U.S. economy. The obverse of that trend is just as likely to
be true and, once the threat of terrorism appears to subside, the
contracting U.S. economy may convince Americans that we cannot afford
to take care of both ourselves and others around the world.</TE>
<TE>   Such shortsightedness would be unfortunate. No one imagines that
the U.S. can, or should, solve the economic problems of the
developing world by itself. Our aid to Afghanistan represents less
than 25% of what that country needs.</TE>
<TE>   If we are to be safe in a world threatened by terrorism, however,
we need to recognize that our obligations do not stop at
Afghanistan's borders.</TE>

<HD>Caltrans: Any Which Way but the Freeway</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>While I certainly do not condone the hurling of insults or missiles
at Caltrans workers, I too am frustrated by the actions of what seems
to be the most thoughtlessly run bureaucracy in the state, a
bureaucracy that apparently schedules its work without the slightest
regard to traffic patterns and time of day ("The Freeway Firing
Line," Jan. 29).</LD>
<LD>   Caltrans workers are usually right there in the thick of it,
squeezing off traffic lanes during peak hours. Even when Caltrans
does show the sense to perform its work at night, it thumbs its nose
at safety. Its workers aim their high-intensity work lights without
regard for the eyes of oncoming drivers.</LD>
<LD>   Worse yet, when Caltrans closes exits and interchanges, its
thoughtless foremen rarely place signs alerting the motorist to that
fact until just past the exit to an available alternate route. It's
no wonder drivers become irate.</LD>
<TE>   Michael Lawler</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   As a retiree, I was a messenger for three years and racked up some
280,000 miles on Southern California roadways. During that time it
became crystal-clear to me that Caltrans was definitely not part of
the solution to the congestion problems but rather the No. 2 cause
(No. 1 being the big rigs).</TE>
<TE>   If the policy at Caltrans was to promote the expeditious flow of
traffic consistent with safety, would it always be starting more
projects at the same time than it can reasonably handle, resulting in
semipermanent gridlocks? Or would it constantly be performing routine
maintenance at peak periods, as it does?</TE>
<TE>   David J. McGill</TE>
<TE>   Sun City</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Drivers are justified in their anger about mounting congestion,
but lashing out at Caltrans workers is not the solution. Instead of
directing their anger toward Caltrans they should be directing it
toward the politicians who have squandered billions of dollars in
public transit projects that carry only 2% of the trips and let the
freeway system (which carries the other 98%) deteriorate and go
uncompleted.</TE>
<TE>   Caltrans devised a plan in the late '50s that accurately predicted
the growth of Southern California and provided sufficient road
capacity. Unfortunately, politicians, who thought they knew better
than you, me and even the engineers and planners, halted construction
and stole highway money for other uses, hoping to stop growth and
force us out of our cars. It did not work; more people moved here,
and now we are in a position where even a minor ramp closure wreaks
havoc. Caltrans employees should be commended for the great job they
do, considering the restraints they work under.</TE>

<LD>Seeing "A Span Without a Reason, Frozen in Time" (Jan. 31) brought
back memories. My father, Fred Strong, was the resident L.A. County
engineer on that project, which was indeed constructed with prison
labor. A high school friend and I hiked in the area many times and
found caves and miners' diggings, which we explored. It was a
beautiful bridge, but I never saw it again after the big storm. I
remember how disappointed we were when the road was closed so many
years ago.</LD>

<LD>Re "L.A. to Integrate Disabled Pupils," Jan. 31: I've been a
secondary school, regular classroom teacher for 14 years and my
observation is that there are already so many disruptive students and
behavioral problems that it's almost impossible to teach. Some
studies show that integrating physically and psychologically disabled
students helps them. My concern is for the regular students who want
to learn. Any teacher will tell you that more special ed students in
the classroom will dilute the learning experience for regular
students. Not to mention burning out the teacher sooner!</LD>

<TE>   I am a teacher at the Perez special education center in East L.A.
Thank you for your positive words about our program. We have about
194 secondary students. Approximately 99 of those are past normal
high school age. There would be no program in regular schools for
these young adults. Many of our students participate in the "High
Five League," consisting of eight special education high schools. We
also have a cheerleaders program. None of these students would be
afforded the opportunity to participate, as they certainly would not
maintain a C average. Where is their least restrictive environment?
Please look at the entire picture.</TE>

<TE>   I was sorry to see a rather negative view of the upcoming move
toward total mainstreaming in the L.A. school district. Your article
stresses the difficulties of integration and seems to see advantages
only for the disabled students. There are also clear advantages for
the regular students; will they not learn important things about the
world if they are seated next to a student in a wheelchair who cannot
speak clearly yet excels in math; or an autistic student who doesn't
know how to say hello in the morning but spells better than anyone
else in the school; or a child with Down syndrome who has an
infinitely kind disposition?</TE>
<TE>   Why do we have to resign ourselves to the prospect of all these
students being teased rather than seeing this change as an
opportunity to teach all children to get along and help each other?</TE>

<LD>Re "Anarcho-Terrorists Cut Their Teeth on Video Games," Commentary,
Jan. 31: When Norah Vincent compares World Economic Forum protesters
to "locusts" and encourages martial law in New York, she couldn't be
more wrongheaded--or ignorant about the people she condemns. As a
participant in the anti-globalization movement, I can say that most
of the protesters I have met are motivated by a deep concern with
social and environmental justice--not by some video-game-inspired
call to anarchy. Vincent needs to listen to the message of the
protesters instead of fogging the issue with her ignorance of
economic reality.</LD>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The odious Norah Vincent continues to ply her illogic in the pages
of The Times. This most recent bout has it that "anarcho-terrorists"
have become blissful addicts of video game violence and thus deserve
a whuppin' by the New York police. Surely she is aware that the real
needle alley exists in the Pentagon, where addiction to simulated
killing is called "training" and where graduates go on to zap for
real. But those victims are usually Third World riffraff, so I guess
on her screen that must not count.</TE>
<TE>   As one protester of the global power grab, I've never come close
to a joystick. Like most demonstrators', mine is a desire for
justice, not violence. I wonder where that figures on her ugly menu.</TE>

<LD>I have been using Paul Mitchell hair products for quite a while, and
I have been hiking and enjoying the beauty of the Santa Monica
Mountains National Recreation Area for an even longer time. But when
I read "Sale Links 2 Pristine Coastal Mountain Sites" (Jan. 31),
stating that Paul Mitchell Hair Care Systems co-founder John Paul
DeJoria has donated 417 acres of pristine coastal habitat along
Malibu, valued at over $13 million, to the Santa Monica Mountains
Conservancy, I knew my brand loyalty had just gotten much stronger.</LD>

wonderful, fragile ecosystem I want to most sincerely say thank you,

<HD>GOP's Star Search Yields Agriculture Secretary</HD>

<AU>PATT MORRISON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Gentlemen, start your tape recorders: Here at last is the speakers'
lineup for the California Republican Party's convention in San Jose.</LD>
<LD>   Among the star turns, from Friday's lunch to the rousing Sunday
send-off speech, are two White House deputy assistants; lame-duck
House Majority Leader Dick Armey (R-Texas); the top guy at the
Republican National Committee, Mark Racicot, and his right-hand
woman, Ann Wagner; and as the headliner, ladies and gentlemen, direct
from the Cabinet Room in Washington, D.C. ... Agriculture Secretary
Ann Veneman!</LD>
<LD>   Veneman won't be coming to alien corn--she's more like coals to
Newcastle, or raisins to Fresno. Veneman is the daughter of a Modesto
peach farmer and popular former state assemblyman. Since Sept. 11,
even agriculture has been drawn into the terrorism loop; there is
more official urgency about food safety than at any time since the E.
coli fast-food burger deaths in the 1990s. (Worth noting: About twice
as many Americans die from food-borne diseases every year than were
killed on Sept. 11.)</LD>
<TE>   Foes Needle Capps Over Tattoo-Removal Project</TE>
<TE>   Who knew that a program for taking off tattoos would put the mark
of Cain on a congresswoman's forehead?</TE>
<TE>   There are 435 members of the House of Representatives, and among
the 7,000-plus checks made out to their bring-home-the-pork projects
in fiscal 2002 was a fairly modest $50,000 to Democratic Rep. Lois
Capps' Santa Barbara district, which she's represented since its
previous occupant, her husband, Walter, died in 1997.</TE>
<TE>   The money was for a project in San Luis Obispo County to remove
tattoos from ex-gangbangers in the belief that cleaning up their skin
will help them clean up their lives.</TE>
<TE>   The local sheriff was for it. So was the probation department.
Tattoo removal has been part of mainstreaming California gang members
for at least a dozen years, from Orange County to San Francisco.</TE>
<TE>   But the news got under the skin of the conservative Heritage
Foundation, and from there it was a short radio wave to Rush
Limbaugh, who ridiculed the program. So did the Cleveland Plain
Dealer newspaper, railing that "you will be paying to cover up
skin-deep stupidities in Capps' home county." Soon piling on were Fox
News and the Daily Oklahoman. The Baltimore Sun led an article on
pork-barrel spending with the tattoo-take-off money.</TE>
<TE>   Capps' seat had been targeted for a take-back by Republicans
anxious to fatten up their 11-seat majority in Congress.
Redistricting gave Capps an air-bag cushion of more Democrats, but
the GOP still hopes she'll get tripped up on tax cuts. Capps, along
with Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein and Rep. Ellen O. Tauscher of
Alamo, voted for the Bush 10-year tax cut, but then said Congress
should at least consider delaying it if the federal deficit gets any
redder.</TE>
<TE>   Californians Make List of Richest Lawmakers</TE>
<TE>   There are two ZIP Codes in America--20515 and 20510--that are just
about eviction-proof and recession-proof, and they're both on Capitol
Hill.</TE>
<TE>   Only a few senators and representatives up for reelection have a
real risk of being voted out (attention Gary Condit), and all 535
lawmakers got a 3.4% pay raise, boosting their annual salary by
$4,900 a year to $150,000.</TE>
<TE>   Not all of them need the dough, though. Eight Californians appear
on a list of the 50 richest lawmakers published by the Capitol Hill
newspaper Roll Call.</TE>
<TE>   Ranking sixth, just behind a Rockefeller, is Rep. Jane Harman, the
Venice Democrat whose holdings, including her husband Sidney's stereo
fortune (Harman Kardon), total about $105 million. Right behind her
is Vista Republican Rep. Darrell E. Issa, another noise-making
multimillionaire with $60 million, chiefly from his car-alarm
company.</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Dianne Feinstein, whose husband is a high-profile financier,
with about $50 million is tied for eighth with Sacramento Republican
Rep. Doug Ose.</TE>
<TE>   Bringing up the still respectably well-off rear are 18th-place
Rep. Gary G. Miller, a Diamond Bar Republican with $15 million ...
San Francisco's Rep. Nancy Pelosi, the newly elected Democratic whip,
coming in 21st with $14 million ... Democratic Rep. Ellen O. Tauscher
of Alamo in the 24th spot with $10million ... and Republican Rep.
David Dreier of San Dimas, in 31st place with $8 million.</TE>
<TE>   (California Democrats Feinstein and Barbara Boxer were both among
the 65 senators voting not to block the pay increase, as Wisconsin
Democrat Russell D. Feingold tried to do in December, arguing that a
raise was a bad idea given that "our economy is in a recession and
hundreds of thousands of workers have been laid off.")</TE>
<TE>   Who's for Whom</TE>
<TE>   Gray Davis: Gordon Spencer, a Republican and Merced County's
district attorney.</TE>
<TE>   Bill Jones: California Farm Bureau Federation; the Lao American
National Republican Party of USA.</TE>
<TE>   Richard Riordan: California state Log Cabin Republicans, and
(surprise!) Women for Riordan.</TE>
<TE>   Points Taken</TE>
<TE>   * "Bloody Baca" screamed the press release from L.A. County
sheriff candidate John Stites about 13 homicides in the San Fernando
Valley in January. He called on the incumbent sheriff to organize "a
posse and a full-court press" in the Valley--which, hello, is chiefly
the beat of the LAPD, not the sheriff.</TE>
<TE>   * The California CoastKeeper Alliance's first "Coastal Hero" award
goes to Lt. Gov. Cruz Bustamante, hailing from that famous coastal
town, Dinuba.</TE>
<TE>   * All four Democrats running for state insurance commissioner
lobbied for votes at the Orange County Democratic Convention in
Anaheim, but the audience didn't exactly stand and cheer when
insurance consultant Bill Winslow declared boldly that the state
should outlaw that newest unalienable right: using hand-held cell
phones behind the wheel.</TE>
<TE>   * Not so, says Gerald Parsky, the White House's man in California,
taking exception to this space: Bush did not all but ignore
California in the 2000 campaign, but made at least a trip a month
here. He also spent $12 million on California TV ads--$1 million for
every point by which he lost the state to Al Gore.</TE>
<TE>   * Using stacks of Oreos to demonstrate the multibillion-dollar
disparities in federal spending, like military versus education, Ben
Cohen, co-founder of Ben &amp; Jerry's Ice Cream, introduced L.A.
politicos to his new Priorities! campaign for a fairer national
budget.</TE>
<TE>   * In Chicago, the dead used to vote, but in California, they
endorse. Board of Equalization member Johan Klehs, who is running for
state controller, touts on his Web site the endorsement of former
board member Richard Nevins, who not only retired in 1985 but died in
July at age 80 in a body-surfing accident.</TE>
<TE>   You Can Quote Me</TE>
<TE>   "I played Elian Gonzalez."</TE>
<TE>   --Guv candidate Riordan exhibited his singular sense of humor in
chatting about TV movie roles with a pretty actress-model at a
campaign event. Riordan, who has taken a few stage and small-screen
roles and decided to stay with politics, played a hospital spokesman
in the Elian movie.</TE>

<HD>FTC to Ease Process of Reporting Identity Theft</HD>
<DH>Fraud: Agency is providing a standard, industry-approved
form for notifying creditors and disputing debts.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KATHY M. KRISTOF</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Federal Trade Commission, in a tacit acknowledgement of the
difficulty for consumers to recover from so-called identity theft, is
expected to announce Tuesday a method for making it easier for
victims to report the fraud to creditors.</LD>
<LD>   The agency's ID Fraud Affidavit, created with assistance from
major card companies and consumer groups, gives consumers a standard
way to dispute the debts and credit scars left by identity thieves.</LD>
<LD>   Such crimes, in which thieves use the victim's Social Security
number and other personal data to open charge accounts and make
purchases, have been growing rapidly in recent years, with an
estimated 600,000 to 750,000 occurrences annually.</LD>
<TE>   The FTC said last month that identity theft accounted for 42% of
all consumer complaints it received in 2001.</TE>
<TE>   "This standardized form . . . will help to streamline the efforts
needed by the victim," said Linda Foley, executive director of the
Identity Theft Resource Center in San Diego.</TE>
<TE>   Consumers who are victimized by this crime generally find out
about it only after the thief stops paying on the debts taken out in
the consumer's name.</TE>
<TE>   In the past, individual creditors often have required victims to
fill out pages of proprietary documentation that needed to be mailed
in, sometimes after being notarized.</TE>
<TE>   The new standardized form, already posted on the government's
identity theft Web site at www.consumer.gov/idtheft and backed by the
financial industry, will eliminate the myriad forms, allowing
consumers to fill out one document and provide photocopies to
creditors.</TE>
<TE>   Most major creditors, including Bank of America, GE Capital and
Merrill Lynch, already have agreed to accept the FTC's standard form,
experts said Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   That should make it easier, but, unfortunately, no less expensive
for consumers to handle the mound of work required to clear their
names after they've been victimized by identity fraud, said Beth
Givens, director of the Privacy Rights Clearinghouse, a San Diego
consumer group that provides information on identity theft.</TE>
<TE>   The seven-page form must be filled out, photocopied and mailed to
the three major credit bureaus, as well as to each creditor duped
into opening an account by an identity thief.</TE>
<TE>   Identity theft experts urge consumers to send the form by
certified mail, return receipt requested, despite the cost of about
$4 per letter. The reason: It prevents creditors from claiming that
they never received the consumer's paperwork--an occurrence consumers
commonly report. Some creditors also still expect the FTC's ID Theft
Affidavit to be notarized--a requirement consumer groups find
onerous.</TE>
<TE>   "If you have a victim dealing with 30 different credit card
accounts, and you have to pay a $10 notary fee each time, that's
$300," Foley said. "If creditors want this form notarized they should
be willing to pay the cost."</TE>
<TE>   The average victim of identity fraud spends 175 hours and an
average of $808 trying to clear their names, according to the
Identity Theft Resource Center.</TE>
<TE>   "The burden of proof still solidly rests on the shoulders of the
victim," said Foley, who was part of the identity fraud task force
that created the new form. "A great deal more needs to be done."</TE>
<TE>   Several bills aimed at preventing identity theft by restricting
access to Social Security numbers and other privy consumer
information are in the works, Foley said. A California law, which
aims to stop companies from using Social Security numbers on public
documents, such as health insurance identification cards, passed last
year and will be phased in, Givens added.</TE>
<TE>   In the meantime, consumers must protect themselves by periodically
reviewing their credit reports and by taking care with documents that
list their Social Security or credit card account numbers.</TE>

<HD>At Andersen, Ex-Fed Chief Is Overseer</HD>
<DH>Accounting: Paul Volcker, former Federal Reserve chairman,
is named to lead a new panel to bring about changes in the firm's
disputed practices.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>WALTER HAMILTON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Accounting firm Andersen announced Sunday that it has hired former
Federal Reserve Board Chairman Paul A. Volcker to head a new internal
oversight board to help overhaul the way the company operates.</LD>
<LD>   The accounting giant also said it would cease two practices that
have been widely criticized for contributing to the downfall of its
former client Enron Corp. Andersen will no longer perform so-called
internal audits of U.S. companies for which it does external reviews,
and will stop doing some technology consulting work for audit
clients.</LD>
<LD>   Andersen's announcement came a day after Enron released a report
that cast blame on Andersen for its role in the collapse of the
onetime energy giant. The report by three Enron board members
excoriated Andersen for signing off on the accounting of partnerships
that lay behind Enron's Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing.</LD>
<TE>   Although Andersen defended itself against the Enron accusations,
it nonetheless said Sunday that it envisions making significant
changes to restore its tattered image.</TE>
<TE>   "We want to improve our standing in the public's mind," said
Joseph F. Berardino, Andersen's chief executive, at a news conference
in Manhattan. "Nobody's going to be more difficult on this firm than
this firm."</TE>
<TE>   The creation of an oversight board could be a significant step in
overhauling disputed practices at Andersen, depending on how much
power the committee is granted, said Mark Cheffers, chief executive
of AccountingMalpractice.com, an educational Web site for
accountants.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a meaningful step and a bold step provided that it is a real
functioning oversight committee," Cheffers said.</TE>
<TE>   Nevertheless, Andersen's announcement underscored the desperate
moves it is undertaking to hang on to customers and to avert
financial problems, Cheffers said.</TE>
<TE>   As Enron's auditor, Andersen has been under fire for giving its
blessing to the energy company's flawed financial statements.</TE>
<TE>   Andersen was paid $5.7 million from 1997 to 2001 for reviewing two
off-the-books partnerships that are at the center of Enron's
collapse, according to the Enron report.</TE>
<TE>   Given that the average hourly accounting fee is about $250, the
total fee indicates that Andersen was deeply involved in reviewing
the deals, Cheffers said.</TE>
<TE>   In 2000, Enron paid Andersen $25 million for auditing services and
an additional $27 million for consulting work.</TE>
<TE>   The widespread practice of the Big Five accounting firms selling
consulting services to their clients is under scrutiny by federal
regulators and Congress.</TE>
<TE>   Andersen's new policy, unveiled ahead of Berardino's scheduled
testimony Tuesday before a House subcommittee, appears to be a
preemptive move to temper critics calling for regulatory and other
industry changes.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, Andersen is being investigated by various
congressional committees and federal regulators over its shredding of
Enron-related documents.</TE>
<TE>   Many experts believe that Andersen will not be able to continue in
its current form. It faces scores of lawsuits from aggrieved
investors, and many say the firm eventually will be forced to accept
a merger with another of the four large accounting firms.</TE>
<TE>   Volcker, 74, said he accepted the unpaid position heading the
oversight board because he believes it will lead to industrywide
reforms.</TE>
<TE>   Volcker has championed accounting-reform proposals. He has been in
favor of limiting the amount of consulting work that accountants can
do for their audit clients.</TE>
<TE>   "I would like to see Andersen return to leadership in the
industry, but my interest is well beyond Arthur Andersen," Volcker
said. "Accounting and auditing in this country is in a state of
crisis."</TE>
<TE>   Volcker guided the Federal Reserve from 1979 to 1987 and is
credited with helping staunch the runaway inflation of the late 1970s
and early 1980s.</TE>
<TE>   Volcker spent most of his career in government service. After
being succeeded at the Fed by Alan Greenspan, he worked at a small
New York investment bank. He is involved in various public service
activities, including the chairing of an international
accounting-standards group.</TE>
<TE>   The oversight board at Andersen probably would consist of three
members, Volcker said. The other two will be chosen in the near
future, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Berardino indicated that the oversight board would have strong
authority to order broad changes in Andersen practices. However, the
exact extent of that authority was unclear.</TE>
<TE>   A written contract between Volcker and Andersen said the board
would have the power to "mandate revisions to policies and procedures
and/or to implement such additional policies and initiatives as it
deems necessary."</TE>
<TE>   Andersen "agrees to be bound by the determinations of the
oversight board," the contract said.</TE>
<TE>   "We have given Mr. Volcker and this oversight board the strongest
of mandates to advise us and to mandate changes where they think it's
appropriate," Berardino said.</TE>
<TE>   At one point, Berardino laughed and said, "We haven't got much
choice."</TE>
<TE>   However, he added later, "Where that line is between management's
[prerogative] and advice is always going to be an interesting
conversation."</TE>
<TE>   Volcker said he would not have accepted the ombudsman role without
the assurance of decision-making power.</TE>
<TE>   "There's no chance I would be here today if I did not think that
the oversight board was going to have strong authority," Volcker
said.</TE>
<TE>   He added that the scope of his panel could be "almost
unprecedented in American business to look over the shoulders of
these people and insist that the changes be made."</TE>
<TE>   The new policies mark a change for Berardino, who spearheaded an
effort two years ago that blunted efforts to curtail accountants from
doing consulting work for their auditing clients.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, Andersen on Sunday stopped well short of saying it would
cease all consulting work for auditing clients. "We fully intend to
build our consulting practice," Berardino said.</TE>

<HD>Baja Strives to Stay the Course Despite Slump</HD>
<DH>Latin America: Projects promise to boost the industrial
base, but there are problems today.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRIS KRAUL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>MEXICALI, Mexico</DL>
<LD>Autos and energy will lift Baja California to a new level of industry
over the next decade. But the border state must first muddle through
a deep slump in tourism and light manufacturing that has state
officials worried.</LD>
<LD>   Eugenio Elorduy Walther, the new governor of Baja California, told
The Times that Mexican officials are negotiating with auto parts
manufacturers  that want to set up operations in the  state to supply
Toyota Motor Corp., which has announced plans to build an assembly
plant in Tijuana this spring.</LD>
<LD>   He also disclosed that Royal Dutch/Shell Group has become the
latest energy company to express interest in building a major liquid
natural gas terminal on the Baja coast. Other sources say Marathon
Petroleum of Houston has acquired an oceanfront Baja site about 15
miles south of the U.S.-Mexico border where it too plans an LNG pier
and processing facility. Neither Shell nor Marathon would comment on
the land deals.</LD>
<TE>   Elorduy said Toyota will invest $100 million in a 700-acre
manufacturing site that will produce pickup truck beds. He declined
to specify which companies are seeking to set up shop to supply
Toyota, but he said new factories probably would be located in
Mexicali, Ensenada and Tijuana. "The benefits will be spread around,"
said Elorduy, a former Mexicali mayor and auto dealer.</TE>
<TE>   Mexico's federal border affairs chief Ernesto Ruffo said last week
that several large infrastructure projects to be unveiled in coming
months will enhance Baja's appeal to heavy manufacturers.</TE>
<TE>   "I dare to think that we are on the eve of a transformation, a new
epoch for Baja California," Ruffo said. New projects could include an
airport, a railroad linking Ensenada and Tecate, roads and water and
port facilities.</TE>
<TE>   Though natural gas projects and the prospect of Toyota's fifth
North American manufacturing operation have generated headlines and
local excitement, the state's bread-and-butter economic sectors,
tourism and light manufacturing, have been hit hard by the U.S.
economic slowdown and the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.</TE>
<TE>   Tourism has declined dramatically, with many weekend and day
visitors from the United States staying home, discouraged by lengthy
border delays caused by heightened security. Rosarito Beach Hotel
owner Hugo Torres Chabert says business at his city's hotels is down
30% since Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   "It's recuperating very slowly. Some people think there is still a
five-hour wait, as there was after the attacks. There has been a
problem in making people know that it is less," Chabert said.
Northbound vehicles at the San Ysidro-Tijuana port of entry wait an
average of an hour to cross. Pedestrians can wait as long to cross.</TE>
<TE>   Rosarito Beach Mayor Luis Enrique Diaz said attendance at the Fox
Studios Baja theme park called Foxploration has been disappointing
since its opening last year and that the complex's film studio has
not had a movie production in more than a year.</TE>
<TE>   Last week, Ensenada lost the twice-weekly port calls of the Royal
Caribbean's 1,500-passenger Viking Serenade cruise ship, which for 11
years had plied the waters from Los Angeles and San Diego and brought
$15 million in business to local suppliers and the tourism industry.</TE>
<TE>   The cruise line announced the end of the Los Angeles to Ensenada
run before the Sept. 11 attacks.</TE>
<TE>   The fallout from the U.S. recession also has caused huge job
losses at the foreign-owned assembly plants along the border known as
maquiladoras.</TE>
<TE>   Additionally, the region is being hit by the 5% addition to the
value-added tax, a levy recently slapped on by the federal government
that applies to imported U.S. goods. Tijuana and other border cities
consume significantly more U.S. goods than Mexico overall.</TE>
<TE>   The tax hike means costs for both businesses and consumers are
rising disproportionately in Tijuana and other border cities, said
Noe Fuentes of the Northern Frontier College in Tijuana, making the
state less competitive in attracting  employers.</TE>
<TE>   So Toyota's announcement in early January that, after a three-year
search, it had decided to establish a new factory in Tijuana, comes
as welcome news. Oscar Arce, a Tijuana attorney who as a former state
official led the negotiations with Toyota, said Baja beat out four
other Mexican states as well as Nevada and California to win Toyota's
commitment.</TE>
<TE>   "They wanted to have a strategic location in the most important
market in Latin America and also be close to California, where its
sales are very strong," Arce said. Arce said Toyota's suppliers would
relocate to Tijuana from Asia and the U.S., to provide "just-in-time"
delivery of parts, reducing Toyota's inventory costs. Like Elorduy,
he declined to identify which suppliers were coming.</TE>
<TE>   The Shell and Marathon proposals to build LNG plants in Baja
follow unveilings of similar projects last year by Sempra Energy of
San Diego and El Paso Corp. All would be positioned to meet the
growing energy demand on both sides of the California-Mexico border.
None has as yet received a permit from the Mexican government. An LNG
plant has never been built in Mexico.</TE>
<TE>   The plants would receive supercooled liquid gas shipped by tanker
from Pacific Rim fields, re-gasify it, then transport it by pipeline.</TE>
<TE>   Sempra has acquired land about 60 miles south of the border and
wants to build a pipeline to the U.S. border to deliver gas to
California.</TE>
<TE>   Sources familiar with the plans of the other energy companies said
that Shell's oceanfront site is adjacent to Sempra's and that Shell
also is discussing the possibility of building a pipeline to the
border. Marathon's property is just south of the Playas de Tijuana
area on the Pacific Coast, sources said.</TE>
<TE>   The gas projects, which would cost hundreds of millions of dollars
each, have not been universally welcomed. The city of Rosarito has so
far refused to give El Paso a land-use permit for the plant, and some
residents of the Bajamar resort community in Ensenada and just north
of the Sempra and Shell sites are said to be unhappy about the
proposals.</TE>
<TE>   Nonetheless, Baja's geographic and strategic advantages make the
state's industrial evolution inevitable, Tijuana's mayor, Jesus
Gonzalez Reyes, said late last month. He expects Toyota to spawn an
"industrial corridor" in an unpopulated area eight miles southeast of
downtown Tijuana.</TE>
<TE>   To help Tijuana cope with increasing traffic, construction will
begin in May on a 30-mile loop road connecting the new U.S.-Mexico
border crossing east of the existing Otay Mesa port of entry to
Rosarito Beach, which is 10 miles south of Tijuana, Gonzalez Reyes
said.</TE>

<HD>Patriotism Barely Gets Off the Bench</HD>
<DH>Advertising: Tradition, humor and rock rule the
between-play action at Super Bowl XXXVI.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GREG JOHNSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Anheuser-Busch Cos. draped one of its five commercials in red, white
and blue in memory of the victims of the Sept. 11 attacks, but most
advertisers that paid an average of $1.9 million for 30-second spots
during Sunday's Super Bowl XXXVI broadcast stuck with tradition and
went for laughs.</LD>
<LD>   Along the way, General Motors Corp. resurrected Led Zeppelin for
Cadillac, H&amp;R Block Inc. enlisted the Beatles, and Britney Spears
time-warped her way through a jingle for Pepsi. Advertisers plastered
their names on video billboards leading in and out of commercials,
and News Corp.'s Fox network, which broadcast the game, worked with
advertisers to present the "Cadillac Super Bowl MVP," the "Taco Bell
Play of the Game" and the "H&amp;R Block of the Game."</LD>
<LD>   A group of USC business school graduate students who watched the
commercials as part of a sports marketing class handed out game balls
to Anheuser-Busch for two first-quarter commercials. The first showed
a trained falcon that terrorized outdoor cafes while retrieving
bottles of Bud Light for its owner; the second parodied the popular
"BattleBots" show on Comedy Central that features death matches
between mechanized robots.</LD>
<TE>   "I loved the Bud Light commercials," said USC graduate student
Abby Harris, 25, who is pursuing law and MBA degrees. "I always go
into the Super Bowl knowing that Bud Light will have some good
commercials, and they didn't let me down."</TE>
<TE>   But the students threw delay-of-game flags for a commercial from
E-Trade Group Inc. starring a chimpanzee; a commercial for mlife,
AT&amp;T Corp.'s new wireless service; and the lengthy spot from PepsiCo
Inc. featuring singer Spears.</TE>
<TE>   "The E-Trade commercial was just bad," said Marianne Leu, 27. As
for the Pepsi spot: "I guess it was a tribute to Pepsi and Britney
Spears, but I don't know who it was supposed to reach," Leu said.
"There was nothing original or creative about it."</TE>
<TE>   The Anheuser-Busch advertisement that showed the company's famous
Clydesdales making a cross-country trip to a point near ground zero
in New York was one of the two overtly patriotic commercials during
Fox's lengthy broadcast of Super Bowl XXXVI from the Superdome in New
Orleans. Barbara Lippert, a critic with trade magazine Adweek,
described the Anheuser-Busch spot for Budweiser beer as "a tractor
pull on the tear ducts."</TE>
<TE>   USC students agreed; the room fell quiet as they watched the
storied Clydesdales end their journey in New York. But the only other
commercial to incorporate patriotism--a spot from online job search
site Monster.com starring former New York Mayor Rudolph W.
Giuliani--fell short of the mark.</TE>
<TE>   "It's like Monster.com tried to capitalize on [the events of Sept.
11]," said Leu, who has lived and worked in Manhattan.</TE>
<TE>   The average cost of a 30-second commercial during the most-watched
telecast of the year fell below the $2-million average that CBS
commanded during last year's broadcast of Super Bowl XXXV, marking
the first back-to-back tumble in the broadcast's history.</TE>
<TE>   The dulling effect of the recession and the fact that NBC will
begin its coverage of the Winter Olympics on Friday created some
anxious moments for the News Corp. network's sales team. Shortly
before the network sold its last spot Thursday, John Nesvig, head of
the Fox sales team, joked that he hadn't "slept at all for the last
three months."</TE>
<TE>   Despite the highly publicized drop in prices, and pregame evidence
suggesting that the St. Louis Rams would make quick work of the
underdog New England Patriots, the Super Bowl was expected to remain
the most expensive buy on television this year, as well as the most
watched.</TE>
<TE>   But New England's thrilling 20-17 win on a 48-yard field goal with
just seconds left in the game gave advertisers their money's worth,
said David Carter, a Los Angeles-based consultant who teaches the USC
sports marketing class. Effective commercials won't be seen, Carter
said, unless "the broadcast contains a compelling sports product."</TE>
<TE>   The broadcast included commercial appeals from several Super Bowl
rookies, including Levi Strauss &amp; Co.'s Dockers brand, Quizno's Corp.
and H&amp;R Block. The timing also was right for such late arrivals as
FedEx Corp. and Masterfoods USA, owner of the M&amp;M candy brand. The
companies waited until late in the advertising game to secure third-
and fourth-quarter spots with price tags reportedly well below $2
million.</TE>
<TE>   Students were divided over the effectiveness of anti-drug
commercials paid for by the federal government. Some thought the
messages might prompt recreational drug users to reconsider their
actions; others thought the Super Bowl was the wrong venue for
serious messages.</TE>
<TE>   The USC students also voted thumbs-down on the mlife
advertisement, which ended with a scene that showed a newborn baby
about to have its umbilical cord cut. The commercial "lost me,"
Harris said. "People are watching the Super Bowl to escape reality."</TE>
<TE>   The Super Bowl broadcast transcends mere football, which usually
is a male-dominated domain. Largely on the strength of commercials
that promise to entertain, the broadcast is unusually attractive to
advertisers trying to reach males and females of all ages.</TE>
<TE>   Universal Studios' Orlando Resort used a spot that showed
Frankenstein's monster pampering a hotel guest at poolside. Universal
opted for the Super Bowl because the broadcast "is a fun place for a
family to be together," said David Angelo, chief creative officer of
David &amp; Goliath, the Los Angeles-based advertising agency that
created the commercial for the unit of Vivendi Universal.</TE>
<TE>   Timing was the key reason Taco Bell suited up for the big game.
The Irvine-based fast food chain had been planning to introduce its
new steak quesadilla sandwich on Sunday. Taco Bell, which last
advertised during the Super Bowl in 1997, began to talk to Fox only
after the NFL delayed postseason play by a week and pushed the Super
Bowl to Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   "If the Super Bowl hadn't been moved back, we wouldn't have been
advertising," said Debbie Myers, vice president of media services,
entertainment and licensing for Taco Bell, a division of Tricon
Global Restaurants Inc.</TE>
<TE>   E-Trade's spot early in the first quarter, which poked fun at
itself for being a bad commercial, missed the mark with the six USC
students. They said last year's E-Trade commercial--which joked about
the failure of competing dot-coms--was more effective.</TE>
<TE>   A first-quarter commercial from Charles Schwab Corp. that showed
home run champ Barry Bonds taking late-night batting practice, scored
favorable reviews.</TE>
<TE>   "It ended with the product, financial services, which is good,
because it's important to keep the emphasis on the product," said
Harte Chaden, 28.</TE>
<TE>   Advertisers look for any edge possible during the pricey Super
Bowl. A minor tussle surfaced over the weekend when Pizza Hut Inc.
and Schwab argued over which advertiser had scored the coveted spot
right before the game started. Pizza Hut, a division of Tricon,
claimed the honor with a spot that ran immediately after the coin
toss; Schwab countered that it sneaked into the advertising end zone
with a 30-second spot sandwiched between the coin toss and the
kickoff.</TE>

<HD>Satellite Radio Aiming High</HD>
<DH>Media: XM has signed up 30,000 customers; Sirius is set to
launch this month. But the subscriber services face many challenges.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JUBE SHIVER Jr.</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>With a bluster reminiscent of high-tech boom years, Hugh Panero,
president of XM Satellite Radio Holdings Inc., boasted recently that
his pioneering radio service had signed up 30,000 subscribers since
launching Nov. 12.</LD>
<LD>   That's 30,000 down and at least 4,970,000 more to go.</LD>
<LD>   Although XM is seeing early success, analysts believe that the
Washington-based company and its main competitor, Sirius Satellite
Radio Inc., each will need 5 million to 6 million subscribers to
break even.</LD>
<TE>   That's a long road for any new technology to travel--and it's one
fraught with daunting obstacles.</TE>
<TE>   "We are in a time of huge transition in the radio industry," said
Tom Taylor, editor of M Street Journal, a radio industry publication.
"The next year in radio is going to feel like the late '90s did with
the Internet."</TE>
<TE>   The problems facing the satellite companies are many, with the
most obvious hurdle being cost. At about $10 a month, subscription
fees for the mostly in-car service have some analysts wondering what
would motivate consumers to pay for radio when they already get so
much of it free.</TE>
<TE>   "The paid-content [media] market is for stuff you can't get free,
like movies or boxing," said Michael Tracey, director of the
University of Colorado's Center for Mass Media Research. "Maybe
there's a niche music market for truck drivers and people who are
real music junkies, but there clearly is no mass market."</TE>
<TE>   The satellite radio services also are facing competition from new
car entertainment options--from digital radio to in-dash MP3 players,
fancier mobile phones and wireless data ventures such as General
Motors Corp.'s OnStar vehicle security and travel advisory service.</TE>
<TE>   XM and New York-based Sirius are unfazed by the concerns. "Radio
hasn't had a technological innovation in 40 years--since the
invention of FM," Panero said. "We want to do what cable television
and satellite TV did to the TV world."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Firms See Opportunity in Program Offerings</TE>
<TE>   Executives at both companies believe that consumers--fed up with
spotty reception and limited programming--will pay for satellite
alternatives that can transmit 100 channels of content such as jazz,
country, classical, comedy and talk radio.</TE>
<TE>   Both companies say they may need only 500,000 to 600,000
subscribers to break even. Panero said XM could have 350,000
subscribers by year's end.</TE>
<TE>   "Will people pay for radio? The answer is a resounding yes,"
Panero said.</TE>
<TE>   The technology that paved the way for XM and Sirius got off the
ground a decade ago when the Federal Communications Commission set
aside airwaves in the 2.3-gigahertz band for satellite-based radio
services. XM and Sirius eventually won FCC licenses to use the
spectrum to broadcast dozens of static-free digital radio channels
from coast to coast.</TE>
<TE>   XM beams its programming from two Boeing Co. satellites 22,000
miles above Earth. The signals are received by a short, stubby
antenna attached to a dashboard-mounted unit capable of tuning
regular AM and FM as well as XM broadcasts.</TE>
<TE>   A few models are portable and can be taken out of the car and used
indoors.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to airing programming that is mostly free of
commercials (Sirius says it will air no ads), both companies said
they expect to lure customers by offering CD-quality sound, exclusive
interviews with music stars and programming for every conceivable
taste.</TE>
<TE>   Sirius, for instance, will offer channels dedicated to bicycling,
motor sports and health when it launches its service this month; XM
has a Hindu channel and 15 channels of rock and Latin music.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a terrific product proposition for the American public: At
the push of a button you have 100 radio stations--most of which you
can't get anywhere else," said Joe Capobianco, senior vice president
for content at Sirius.</TE>
<TE>   The companies' strategy is to first win the battle for the
dashboard, where consumers spend more than $2 billion each year to
install about 11 million aftermarket car radios. An additional 17
million radios are installed annually by auto makers.</TE>
<TE>   General Motors, which owns a 6% stake in XM, is offering an XM
radio and up to one year of subsidized service as an option in
selected car models. That means XM will get a check for about $100
for each vehicle sold under the promotional offer.</TE>
<TE>   Sirius is in partnership with Ford Motor Co., DaimlerChrysler and
BMW, among others.</TE>
<TE>   The two companies have worked to trim operating costs by
engineering smaller radio chips, encouraging subscribers to pay in
advance and sign up for radio service on the Web or directly through
car makers.</TE>
<TE>   Utilizing a strategy that made subscription satellite video
service DirecTV a success, Sirius President Joe Clayton said his
company may try varying the price of its proposed $12.95 monthly
service fee regionally to reflect variations in the cost of living.</TE>
<TE>   Still, it is taking mountains of cash to keep the services afloat.</TE>
<TE>   Sirius previously announced that it raised $148 million to help
finance operations through the second quarter of 2003.</TE>
<TE>   Heinz Stubblefield, XM's chief financial officer, said the company
will spend $25 million to $50 million in the next few months, mostly
for programming and satellite operating expenses. The company
reported a loss of $144 million for the last quarter of 2001.</TE>
<TE>   Much of XM's money has been spent on its Washington headquarters,
where 450 employees are housed in a remodeled 150,000-square-foot
building with 82 digital production studios.</TE>
<TE>   The mounting debts to build and operate the system, along with its
uncertain future have sent the stocks of both companies gyrating.</TE>
<TE>   Over the last year, Sirius shares have been as high as $34 and as
low as $2.20. They closed Friday at $7.13, up 90 cents on Nasdaq. XM
has seen its stock hit $21 over the last year--and plummet as low as
$3.87. Its shares Friday closed at $12.17, up 81 cents, also on
Nasdaq.</TE>
<TE>   Both services have drawn a mixed reaction from the nation's 13,000
radio broadcasters, which stand to lose audience share if satellite
radio takes off.</TE>
<TE>   Though some broadcasters are attracted to the prospect of a
national audience, XM has been under fire from the industry's
dominant trade group, the National Assn. of Broadcasters, as well as
some local station owners, who fear the companies might develop local
programming and advertising to compete with existing stations.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Competition Will Skyrocket</TE>
<TE>   Satellite radio is arriving just as a torrent of new radio
competition is ready to flood the market.</TE>
<TE>   Two years ago, the FCC authorized low-powered radio--a service
that could create up to 1,000 new stations. Their signals won't
travel very far, but they will spawn a great deal of new content.</TE>
<TE>   The FCC also is planning to auction up to 350 now-dormant FM
stations this year and set a standard for the nation's AM and FM
stations to switch to new digital technology, which would allow
broadcasters to offer better-quality sound as well as new programs
and services.</TE>
<TE>   "There is going to be a tremendous increase in competition, and
broadcasters are going to have to increase their focus on format
diversity--you can't have five country stations in a market all
making money," said Mark O'Brien, executive vice president at BIA
International, a radio and television industry research firm.</TE>
<TE>   Some experts say local broadcasters have the advantage over the
new satellite technology since only they can offer traffic reports,
local sports scores and community talk shows that appeal to rush-hour
motorists.</TE>
<TE>   But XM's chief programmer, Lee Abrams, said the advantage
ultimately may be small compared with satellite radio's promise.</TE>
<TE>   He likened its potential impact to that of FM radio in the 1970s.
He said FM's superior sound and lack of commercial clutter eventually
triggered a huge audience shift away from its AM rival.</TE>
<TE>   "We play every imaginable type of music," Abrams said. "The old FM
playbook is obsolete.... We are in a Palm Pilot-Internet-cell phone
era and traditional radio is no longer part of the equation."</TE>

<HD>Immunex CEO Getting Lucrative Amgen Deal</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DENISE GELLENE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The head of Immunex Corp. will leave the executive suite with a
lucrative ''golden parachute'' and a part-time job at Amgen Inc. that
will pay at least $2,083 an hour.</LD>
<LD>   Chief Executive Edward V. Fritzky, 51, is getting a two-year
contract that pays him $500,000 a year for no more than 20 hours of
work each month, according to a regulatory filing. Amgen also will
pay up to $250,000 to provide Fritzky with office space.</LD>
<LD>   Thousand Oaks-based Amgen made the filing in connection with its
pending $16-billion acquisition of rival Immunex in the largest
biotechnology merger ever. The deal gives Amgen a potential
blockbuster drug in Enbrel, a treatment for rheumatoid arthritis.</LD>
<TE>   In connection with the deal, which requires shareholder approval,
Merrill Lynch &amp; Co., advisor to Immunex, will receive $30 million in
fees. The amount Amgen will pay its advisors, Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co.,
Bear, Stearns &amp; Co. and Salomon Smith Barney, wasn't disclosed.</TE>
<TE>   Amgen also disclosed that Immunex faces three shareholder suits in
Washington state court over the merger. Two suits allege Immunex
should have auctioned itself to obtain a higher price and all three
suits accuse Immunex officers of failing to act in the best interests
of shareholders. Immunex is fighting the suits, which seek
class-action status.</TE>
<TE>   Amgen will pay Fritzky, who is expected to join Amgen's board,  a
''retention bonus'' of $1 million, over two years. That's on top of
the $5.4-million lump sum Fritzky will receive as a golden parachute.</TE>
<TE>   He also will get a grant of 100,000 restricted Amgen
shares--34,000 immediately and the rest spread over two years. At
Amgen's closing price Friday of $57.88, that benefit is worth $5.8
million. And Fritzky will get an option for 450,000 more Amgen
shares.</TE>
<TE>   These benefits are in addition to the amount Fritzky will receive
for his 2.8 million Immunex shares, the amount he owns according to
the company's 2001 proxy. Those shares are worth $84.3 million based
on Amgen's Friday close.</TE>
<TE>   Fritzky earned $680,000 in salary and received a $1.4-million
bonus in 2000 at Immunex.</TE>
<TE>   Other top officers of Immunex will get packages and retention
bonuses. Peggy V. Phillips, chief operating officer, will receive a
combined $4.6 million and Douglas E. Williams, chief technology
officer, will get a combined $3.4 million. They have agreed to join
Amgen.</TE>
<TE>   Phillips' Immunex stake is worth $34.3 million and Williams' is
worth $25.3 million, based on figures in Immunex's proxy.</TE>

<HD>Argentina Will Drop Dollar Peg, Float Peso</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>BUENOS AIRES</DL>
<LD>Argentina on Sunday unveiled its strategy to pull the crisis-wracked
economy from recession, saying it would ditch the U.S. dollar, fully
float the devalued peso and partially lift a savings freeze that
sparked public outrage and riots.</LD>
<LD>   Economy Minister Jorge Remes Lenicov said the government would run
the economy just on pesos, turn all dollar bank loans into pesos at
the pre-devaluation one-to-one rate and give people full access to
wages paid into the bank.</LD>
<LD>   But he did not say when the peso would be fully floated. It
already has been partially floated on the foreign exchange market,
having fallen to about two to the dollar since devaluation.</LD>
<TE>   "We are going to need international help, because it will help us
speed up our exit from this crisis," Remes Lenicov said, adding that
he planned to send an "austere" 2002 budget to Congress on Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   International lenders such as the International Monetary Fund are
demanding deep spending cuts as conditions for financial aid that the
bankrupt economy needs to help it climb from a deep recession that is
in its fourth year.</TE>
<TE>   Argentines with dollar bank loans come off best under the plan,
with the loans turned into pesos at parity to the dollar. But savers
stand to lose, with dollar savings  turned into pesos at the official
1.40-to-the-dollar rate.</TE>
<TE>   There will be a banking and foreign exchange market holiday  today
and Tuesday, Remes Lenicov said, because a Supreme Court ruling
Friday completely overturned a savings freeze, throwing experts and
officials into confusion.</TE>
<TE>   Economists said it could send Argentines rushing to withdraw their
deposits, which were  limited to 1,500 pesos a month in December to
avoid a run on the banks. The nation's banks lost a record 20% to 25%
of deposits last year.</TE>
<TE>   Lifting the freeze could destroy many banks, already on their
knees after a debt default and peso devaluation, and possibly spark
another massive depreciation of the peso.</TE>

<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Personal technology gear has been around since the dawn of, well,
personal technology. But our forefathers didn't need a weekly column
that reviewed the latest gear--one black desk phone was pretty much
like the rest.</LD>
<LD>   Then came Dictaphones, facsimile machines and car phones;
Instamatics and Polaroids. Cassette recorders, Walkmans and
camcorders. And a device of initially dubious value, the personal
computer.</LD>
<LD>   And today? We have supercomputer-grade PCs, laptop and hand-held
computers, Web-enabled cell phones, global positioning system
receivers, digital camcorders and cameras, and an asteroid belt of
accessories orbiting each.</LD>
<TE>   In the midst of this mayhem, some trends stand out--themes that
will play out each week in this space.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Hype is alive and well. In every category of personal technology,
several standards are vying for dominance. Mac versus Windows, Palm
versus Pocket PC. Wi-Fi versus Bluetooth. Every company wants you to
believe its answers are the right ones. To avoid buying into a dead
end, you'll need advice on personal technology products and trends.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Things are getting smaller. Like you need me to tell you that. But
have you heard about the key chain that stores one gigabyte? Or the
new video camera that fits in a shirt pocket and can also send and
receive e-mail? I'll review these and other miniature marvels in
future columns.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Everything is "intertwingled." Today's gear must labor in the
shadow of an eight-syllable word: "interoperability." Our phones and
hand-held computers can talk with our laptops and desktops, and
vice-versa. We can access the Internet with our cell phones and make
phone calls over the Internet with our PCs. We can watch TV on our
PCs and access the Web on our TVs. The lines between devices are
blurring, and that can complicate the process of choosing the right
tool for the job.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   All the world's a bit stream. Much of the information and
entertainment that we consume and create now exists in the digital
domain. Satellites are beaming digital TV and radio streams to homes
and even cars. Digital cameras represent about one-third of new
camera sales. Camcorders are storing scenes as bits and bytes, and
portable music players are bringing new meaning to the phrase "play
it from memory."</TE>
<TE>   All these devices are computers unto themselves, but they haven't
rendered the personal computer obsolete. Quite the contrary: The
computer has evolved into a hub for managing the gigabits from our
work and play. And that makes it increasingly important to understand
the technologies that underlie the digital age.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Wires are disappearing. At the turn of the previous century,
communications went from wired to wireless. It's happening again. The
wires that tether computers to each other and that tether accessories
to computers are being replaced by wireless radio links. You can
create networks without stringing wires, and your laptop can tap into
the Internet from the local Starbucks. And new technologies such as
the long-ballyhooed Bluetooth are promising to eliminate desktop
cable clutter by allowing wireless communications between devices.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Optical is in. You can't buy a personal computer that doesn't
include a CD-ROM drive, DVD drive or CD burner. DVD burners are even
becoming popular. You can create your own DVDs of everything from
training sessions to home movies. Optical storage is also replacing
tape in some audio and video recorders. Its playback quality,
durability, and random-access convenience make tape seem as archaic
as 78-rpm records.</TE>
<TE>   Maybe we don't need every digital doodad to do our work. But we
definitely need some of them. And we may just want the others.</TE>
<TE>   Gear can be awfully seductive to some people. You know who you
are, and I'll see you here next week.</TE>

<HD>Meltdown Is Deja Vu for Some at Enron</HD>
<DH>Energy: Executives who warned about practices had similar
experiences at MG Corp. in the 1990s.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LEE ROMNEY and WALTER HAMILTON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>There were massive financial losses and ousted executives.
Finger-pointing at the company's auditor, Andersen, for not ringing
alarm bells. An executive who warned of what could lie ahead but was
unheeded.</LD>
<LD>   And ultimately, a corporate collapse.</LD>
<LD>   The story is Enron Corp.'s. But it is also that of MG Corp., a
German conglomerate's U.S. subsidiary that suffered its own
high-profile meltdown in the early 1990s.</LD>
<TE>   And in a tale of intertwining fates, Enron executives who warned
about Enron's practices last year had worked at MG and seen it all
before.</TE>
<TE>   Jeffrey McMahon, promoted last week to Enron president and chief
operating officer, was MG's internal auditor. In 1993, he warned his
bosses of poor internal controls in the months before MG began to
fall, copies of the audits obtained by The Times show.</TE>
<TE>   Sherron S. Watkins, the Enron vice president whose memo to former
Enron Chairman and Chief Executive Kenneth L. Lay last summer
predicted the company would "implode in a wave of accounting
scandals"--and pointed to McMahon as equally concerned--also had
worked at MG.</TE>
<TE>   That experience, according to one friend and former colleague of
Watkins, helped her foresee how fast and hard Enron could fall.</TE>
<TE>   The crises that battered both companies are far from identical.
MG--which is still alive, but no longer owns any operating
businesses--was done in by an ill-fated bet on oil futures. Enron's
slide was triggered in part when losses hidden in off-balance-sheet
partnerships suddenly were disclosed.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Both Turned  to Derivatives</TE>
<TE>   But among the striking similarities is that both companies took
risky forays into so-called derivatives that pushed the envelope of
conventional finance, economists familiar with the companies said.</TE>
<TE>   Derivatives are financial contracts whose value is derived from
the price of an underlying stock, commodity or index. They can be
used to make high-octane market bets or to hedge against market
moves.</TE>
<TE>   Both firms also used aggressive "mark-to-market" accounting. The
goal of mark-to-market accounting is for companies to list the true
value of their assets at prevailing market prices. But experts say
the technique can be abused in thinly traded markets where companies
can arbitrarily assign high values to their assets.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, both companies displayed a hubris during their peak
years that stood out against their humbling descents, one source
said.</TE>
<TE>   For those who were in both workplaces, the parallels are all too
strong.</TE>
<TE>   "I can see anyone who had been at MG saying, 'Hey, I've been here
before,'" said Philip K. Verleger Jr., an energy economist who served
as an expert witness for MG's parent company in the subsequent
litigation. "It must have become increasingly uncomfortable."</TE>
<TE>   MG unraveled in late 1993, when a sudden plunge in world oil
prices left it with gaping losses in energy derivatives.</TE>
<TE>   Until that time, MG had been aggressively signing long-term
contracts with energy distributors and marketers to supply them with
gasoline and other oil products. Because it promised deliveries at
fixed prices, MG sought to guard against a sudden rise in oil prices.</TE>
<TE>   To do that, MG invested in oil futures contracts and other
derivatives that would increase in value if oil prices rose.
Theoretically, the gains in derivatives would offset any losses on
the energy contracts. But rather than rising, oil prices sank
abruptly. MG incurred steep losses on its large derivatives holdings.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Hypothetical Profit on Books</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the cash flow from the long-term contracts MG signed to
supply gasoline to energy firms was dwarfed by the short-term losses
on the derivatives. And in some cases, MG had structured the
contracts so customers didn't have to take any supply, or make any
payments, for a decade. Yet MG already had recorded expected
long-term profit from the energy-supply contracts on its books.</TE>
<TE>   MG's losses eventually reached $2.7billion. The bankruptcy of its
parent, Metallgesellschaft, once Germany's 14th-largest company, was
averted only by a bailout by German banks.</TE>
<TE>   The parent company underwent an aggressive restructuring and
eventually liquidated its U.S. oil trading unit.</TE>
<TE>   Neither Watkins nor her attorney returned calls for comment on her
three-year stint at New York-based MG Corp.'s financing arm--MG Trade
Finance Group--which she left in 1993 to join Enron.</TE>
<TE>   Watkins was not at the center of the MG storm, which involved MG
Refining &amp; Marketing Inc. But one friend said she had mentioned her
experience with that company's debacle when sounding alarms at Enron.</TE>
<TE>   McMahon was closer to the crisis. As internal auditor of MG, he
issued several internal audits that raised concerns about the oil
trading unit.</TE>
<TE>   An August 1993 report concluded that the unit's risk-management
procedure "requires improvement" and that the overall risk-management
system was "somewhat informal."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Warning Ignored by Executives</TE>
<TE>   Apparently referring to the increasingly large and risky
derivatives positions that the unit was taking on, McMahon wrote that
the exposure to losses was "much larger than anticipated in the
original business plan."</TE>
<TE>   McMahon said through Enron spokesman Mark Palmer that he had
attempted to alert his superiors to potential problems at the trading
unit.</TE>
<TE>   McMahon "found a lot of problems," Palmer said. "They just didn't
have the governance structure to manage the trading positions."</TE>
<TE>   The audits "fell on deaf ears" until the losses mounted in late
1993, said New York attorney Bob Bernstein, who represents
Metallgesellschaft, now known as MG Technologies.</TE>
<TE>   "Jeff's reports ... were quite prescient," Bernstein said. "Was he
the most important person? No. Was Jeff McMahon an important person?
Yes.... He's a person of honor and integrity who saw things that were
wrong and alerted people to that."</TE>
<TE>   At Enron, McMahon has emerged as one of a handful of executives
who allegedly was concerned by off-balance-sheet partnerships headed
by former Chief Financial Officer Andrew S. Fastow.</TE>
<TE>   According to Watkins' memo, McMahon was "highly vexed over the
inherent conflicts of [the partnerships]. He complained mightily to
Jeff Skilling."</TE>
<TE>   Days later, Watkins wrote, Skilling offered McMahon a different
job heading another Enron unit. With Skilling and Fastow both gone by
fall, McMahon became CFO.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Finger-Pointing Followed Collapse</TE>
<TE>   As with Enron, MG's collapse was held forth as having broad
implications for corporate governance, financial controls and
derivatives trading.</TE>
<TE>   There were allegations that German board members--who claimed they
were kept in the dark about the U.S. trading unit's problems--were
too close to the company. Similar concerns swirl around Enron's
board.</TE>
<TE>   There also were questions about accounting firm Andersen.
According to published reports, the German parent pointed a finger at
the firm for supporting MG's interpretation of its numbers and
replaced Andersen by 1994.</TE>
<TE>   Patrick Dorton, an Andersen spokesman, said MG's problems were due
to the big swing in oil prices.</TE>
<TE>   "This is simply the case of a company caught on the wrong side of
a dramatic slide in oil prices, like many other companies were at
that time," Dorton said, refusing to comment further.</TE>
<TE>   In Enron's case, Andersen is under investigation for shredding
Enron-related documents after the Securities and Exchange Commission
had launched an investigation of the energy trader. The firm has
denied that it authorized shredding.</TE>
<TE>   The companies' financial practices also bear similarities. MG has
been described in academic papers as a derivatives "horror story."
Now, there are signs that in Enron's hands derivatives evolved into
tools of fiscal concealment and manipulation, some experts say,
allowing Enron to inflate the value of assets while understating the
risks involved.</TE>
<TE>   Palmer rejected the notion that the company's problems are tied in
any way to derivatives. Enron's trading operation suffered when the
company's credit rating was cut, not by the trading itself, which he
said was profitable.</TE>
<TE>   Nonetheless, both MG and Enron entered long-term contracts whose
ultimate values were difficult to predict and booked the hypothetical
long-term profit from those contracts in the present. That
mark-to-market accounting has emerged as a trouble spot in both
cases, said John Parsons, a financial economist at Charles River
Associates in Boston.</TE>
<TE>   "People are marking to what their own opinion is of the value,"
Parsons said. If those opinions are wrong, the financial consequences
can be severe.</TE>
<TE>   As it turned out, Enron and MG became directly linked: Eighteen
months ago, Enron bought the company's London-based metals trading
operation, and the Enron and MG logos are side by side in Madison
Avenue office space.</TE>
<TE>   That relationship is now ending. Sempra Energy last week announced
its purchase of the metals business.</TE>
<TE>   The similar fates of MG and Enron strike some observers as eerie.</TE>
<TE>   "It's almost identical," economist Verleger said. "I think that
Enron inadvertently blundered into the same corporate model that
caused the collapse of MG."</TE>

<HD>Investors Will Look to Economic Reports</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>If investors don't get another anxiety attack over more "Enronitis"
waiting in the wings, stocks are expected to rise this week.</LD>
<LD>   Wall Street will look to see if fresh economic data give more
signals of recovery.</LD>
<LD>   But the crisis of confidence after Texas-based energy trading
giant Enron Corp.'s record bankruptcy and complicated accounting
problems will continue to cast a pall over the market.</LD>
<TE>   The Enron crisis has raised concerns that other companies may have
accounting bombshells waiting to be dropped. That, in turn, has hurt
the shares of firms with complex corporate structures.</TE>
<TE>   Seeking more clues on the status of the world's largest economy,
investors will pick apart reports on orders in the non-manufacturing
services sector, retail sales, layoffs, productivity and unit labor
costs, weekly jobless claims, consumer credit and wholesale
inventories.</TE>
<TE>   One factor helping stocks, said Howard Kornblue, a portfolio
manager with Pilgrim Inc., was the Federal Reserve's decision to keep
interest rates steady last week after slashing rates 11 times in the
last year. This is seen as a sign the economy is OK and doesn't need
more monetary stimulus.</TE>
<TE>   Tuesday, Wall Street pros and Main Street investors may get a
severe case of eyestrain as they scan all the economic data.</TE>
<TE>   Retail chain-store sales for the week ending Feb. 2 will be issued
before the market's regular session opens by the Bank of
Tokyo-Mitsubishi and UBS Warburg. The statistics are compiled from
seven major U.S. discount, department and chain stores, including
Wal-Mart Stores Inc. .</TE>
<TE>   Half an hour after the opening bell, two reports will be issued:
December factory orders and the Institute for Supply Management's
non-manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index for January.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Other economic reports due out this week:</TE>
<TE>   Tuesday, Institute of Supply Management releases its
non-manufacturing services index for January.</TE>
<TE>   Wednesday, Labor Department releases a preliminary reading on
fourth-quarter productivity and unit labor costs.</TE>
<TE>   Thursday, Federal Reserve issues its December consumer credit
report.</TE>

inventories.</TE>

<BD>Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Corporate America's quarterly reporting season will slip into a lower
gear. Investors, after riding out the corporate sector's worst
earnings slide in more than a decade, see most of that in the
rear-view mirror. The mood has turned to cautious optimism about
projections for better results ahead.</LD>
<LD>   Among the smattering of earnings scorecards on tap for the week
are such marquee names as Web gear titan Cisco Systems Inc. and
telecommunications group WorldCom Inc.</LD>
<LD>   "Companies that have any disappointments would have by now warned
us," said Howard Kornblue, a portfolio manager with the $18-billion
Pilgrim Inc. "If anything, we always have the potential for positive
surprise, which would help the market."</LD>
<TE>   Nearly 70% of the companies in the Standard &amp; Poor's 500
index--349 companies--have reported results. Earnings were down 23.7%
from the fourth quarter of 2000. This is worse than expectations of a
yearly decline of 22.4%, said Joseph Kalinowski, senior equity
strategist with market watcher Thomson Financial.</TE>
<TE>   This would make the 2001 fourth quarter the worst since earnings
fell 24.2% in the 1991 second quarter, Kalinowski says. Sixty-seven
companies in the technology-laden Nasdaq 100 have issued results,
with reported earnings down 40.8% from last year, he added.</TE>

<HD>EU Ready to Drop Intel Antitrust Investigation</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The European Commission said it is set to drop its antitrust
investigation of Intel Corp., the No. 1 computer chip maker, after
failing to find evidence the company was abusing its dominant
position.</LD>
<LD>   The commission's "preliminary assessment is expected to find that
the complaints are unfounded," said Amelia Torres, a spokeswoman for
Competition Commissioner Mario Monti. An Intel spokeswoman in Germany
declined to comment. In the U.S., Intel spokesman Tom Beermann didn't
return a call seeking comment.</LD>
<LD>   The commission, the 15-nation European Union's executive agency,
opened the investigation in April after complaints the U.S. company
was using loyalty programs and rebates to prevent customers from
going to competitors. Intel's main rivals are Advanced Micro Devices
Inc. and Taiwan's Via Technologies Inc.</LD>
<TE>   "The case hasn't got merit," said Ashok Kumar, analyst at U.S.
Bancorp Piper Jaffray, who has an "outperform" rating on Intel
shares. "Intel is fairly cognizant of potential infractions and they
steer clear of that."</TE>
<TE>   Intel could have faced a fine as high as 10% of sales if found
guilty. That threat still hangs over Microsoft Corp., which the
commission is investigating for allegedly abusing its dominance of
operating system software.</TE>
<TE>   "This is not like the Microsoft investigation," Kumar said. "This
is more of a sideshow."</TE>
<TE>   Santa Clara, Calif.-based Intel controls 84% of the European
microprocessor market, which generated a quarter of the company's $34
billion in sales in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   The commission studied whether the way Intel licenses the design
of the connections that link chips with other computer components
discriminates against competitors, according to the New York Times,
which reported earlier that the probe would be dropped.</TE>
<TE>   Advanced Micro spokesman John Greenagel didn't return calls
seeking comment.</TE>
<TE>   The ending of the probe comes as EU antitrust investigators
approved Hewlett-Packard Co.'s proposed $23.8-billion purchase of
Compaq Computer Corp.</TE>

<HD>Collecting of Hair Samples for Drug Tests May Be Legal</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Question: At my company, seven of the 300 employees were selected for
a drug test. We had to provide a hair sample as well as a urine
sample.</LD>
<LD>   Since a hair test would show medical conditions and other vital
information, isn't this an invasion of privacy?</LD>
<LD>   I was fired after the hair test results. I had used a controlled
substance on my vacation 90 days earlier. It in no way affected my
job performance when I returned.</LD>
<TE>   What can I do?</TE>
<TE>   --L.B., North Hills</TE>
<TE>   Answer: It depends how you were selected for the test and the
language of your employer's substance abuse policy.</TE>
<TE>   If you were selected because your employer had reasonable
suspicion that you had been using drugs, your test and subsequent
termination would be legal.</TE>
<TE>   Reasonable suspicion can arise from such things as impaired job
performance, job-related accidents that might suggest drug use,
erratic attendance, suspicious behavior or reports from witnesses who
saw you using drugs.</TE>
<TE>   If you were selected purely at random, the test and termination
may be unlawful, unless you are employed in law enforcement or the
transportation industry.</TE>
<TE>   California law does not permit random drug testing of employees in
most jobs.</TE>
<TE>   The fact that hair samples were tested does not constitute an
unlawful invasion of your privacy.</TE>
<TE>   You should check the employer's policy. If it prohibits employees
only from coming to work "under the influence" of drugs, you could
argue your termination did not conform to policy.</TE>
<TE>   If the policy prohibits employees from coming to work with drugs
"in their system," however, it would cover traces of drugs found in a
hair test.</TE>

<TE>   Q: I work for a company that has more than 100 employees. Most are
hourly while the rest, such as myself, are salaried.</TE>
<TE>   Hourly employees are paid every two weeks, while salaried
employees are paid on the 15th and last day of every month.</TE>
<TE>   When both pay periods recently landed on the same day--the
15th--the company delayed paying salaried workers a day, saying the
payroll company could not process checks for both types of workers.</TE>
<TE>   We were not told this in advance. We found out only after
inquiring when we discovered that the money had not been deposited in
our bank accounts.</TE>
<TE>   Isn't our employer required to pay us on our posted pay date? We
are being told that because the pay period is technically through the
15th, they aren't required to pay until the end of the month.</TE>
<TE>   Would the company be required to pay any overdraft fees workers
faced because of the delay?</TE>
<TE>   --G.G., Orange</TE>
<TE>   A: For 65 years, California law has required employers to
establish regular paydays and to post in a conspicuous place a notice
specifying the time and place of payment. Hourly and salaried
employees alike are entitled to receive their paychecks on the
regular payday.</TE>
<TE>   Although state law does not permit employees to recover overdraft
fees when a payment is late, management can be criminally prosecuted
for violating these requirements. In addition, the State Division of
Labor Standards Enforcement can recover a penalty of $50 per employee
for a first offense, and $100 per employee for each violation
thereafter.</TE>

<TE>   Q: After I was hired, I was told that the hospital where I work
requires CPR training for admitting and security departments.</TE>
<TE>   Although I was required to take a class at the hospital, I was not
compensated for the time and had to pay a fee for the class.</TE>
<TE>   Are there laws about this?</TE>
<TE>   --P.C., Fullerton</TE>
<TE>   A: An employer must pay for the time and cost of training its
employees. The Labor Code requires an employer to reimburse an
employee for all expenses related to his or her job duties.</TE>
<TE>   Certainly, the employer would not have to cover the cost of
optional education or training obtained by an employee.</TE>
<TE>   In this case, it's also significant that the training is required
of current employees. Had a certain level of education or training
been required as a condition of new employment, the cost would have
been the employee's responsibility.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Microsoft Corp. is expected to announce today that the independent
horror film "Wendigo" will be screened at two theaters in March in
the Windows Media digital video format.</LD>
<LD>   The distributors of the movie--ContentFilm and Magnolia
Pictures--plan to compress the film into a Windows Media file and
transmit it digitally to theaters in Seattle and Dallas, where it
will be shown via a digital projector.</LD>
<LD>   Microsoft's format is much more compact than the emerging standard
for digital cinema files, which makes Windows Media films less
expensive to transmit and store. But critics say one trade-off is in
picture quality.</LD>
<TE>   Microsoft is targeting independent film distributors, which may be
most receptive to the company's low-cost approach.</TE>

<LD>Sky Dayton thinks he can make money by pulling the Internet out of
thin air.</LD>
<LD>   The 30-year-old founder of EarthLink Inc. made his name by
streamlining the complicated business of delivering the Internet to
homes.</LD>
<LD>   Dayton now wants to bring high-speed access to travelers as they
move between airports, hotel lobbies and spaces equipped with
wireless networks using the technology known as 802.11b, or Wi-Fi,
which can move data at speeds of up to 11 megabits a second.</LD>
<TE>   His latest venture is Boingo Wireless Inc., a year-old Santa
Monica start-up with $15 million of funding from venture capitalists
New Enterprise Associates and Evercore Ventures, and from wireless
carrier Sprint PCS and other smaller investors.</TE>
<TE>   On Jan. 21, Boingo began serving as the point of contact for 400
Wi-Fi "hot spots" across the country, including the major airports in
Austin, Texas; Dallas; San Jose and Seattle, and various hotels run
by Four Seasons, Hilton, Marriott, Sheraton, Radisson, and Wyndham.</TE>
<TE>   Boingo offers consumers pricing plans from $7.95 to $74.95 a
month, depending on the amount of time used.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>This month's Winter Olympic Games in Salt Lake City will be awash in
high technology, with athletes and non-combatants alike using the
latest gear to compete, judge and document the events.</LD>
<LD>   The International Olympic Committee isn't letting the cutting edge
slice into its lucrative relationship with global TV broadcasters,
however. It has barred Internet transmission of any digital audio or
video from the Games until the Olympic flame is snuffed out.</LD>
<LD>   As a result, the only way to watch the Olympics in the U.S. is to
tune your television to NBC or one of its two cable TV outlets, CNBC
and MSNBC. You won't even find highlights of the competition online
while the games are being played.</LD>
<TE>   The IOC's stance is an aberration at a time when sports leagues
are increasingly turning to the Web as an alternative--and
revenue-generating--outlet for audio and video. Major league baseball
sells subscriptions to a full season of games on Web radio, for
example.</TE>
<TE>   "There are two main reasons," said Stephane Kanah, Internet
manager for the IOC. "Today, there is not sufficient bandwidth or
quality to show the emotions and to be able to view the competition
properly.</TE>
<TE>   "And most importantly, in order to protect our broadcasters'
rights, especially those who are not broadcasting the games live ...
we have restricted live videos until there is a technology that
allows us to restrict access to videos [geographically]."</TE>
<TE>   The Summer and Winter Olympics have long been financed by
squeezing billions of dollars out of broadcasters, each of which pays
for the exclusive right to present the games in their country. Those
broadcasters, in turn, need strong ratings to sustain the premium
fees they charge advertisers.</TE>
<TE>   If viewers can get their fill of bobsledding or snowboarding races
from a Web site, ratings and advertising revenue will drop.
Broadcasters will bid less for the rights to the next Olympics,
generating less money for the Games.</TE>
<TE>   That, at least, is the IOC's contention. And online broadcasting
experts agree that it's hard to build a 100% reliable electronic
fence around a Web broadcast, as the IOC requires.</TE>
<TE>   But Larry Jacobson, president and chief operating officer of
RealNetworks Inc., said technologies have emerged in the last six
months to meet the IOC's needs. These efforts have been spurred by
the demands of record companies and Hollywood studios, which also cut
up the world into different markets with exclusive distribution
rights, Jacobson said.</TE>
<TE>   NBC, which would be first up with online video from the games,
isn't complaining.</TE>
<TE>   "The most overrated thing in the world, at this point in time, is
live video or live streaming on the Web," said Tom Feuer,
coordinating producer for NBC's Olympics site.</TE>
<TE>   Watching video online through a dial-up modem can be a miserable
experience. But more than 20 million consumers have high-speed
Internet connections at home, which can deliver a full-screen picture
in something close to videotape quality.</TE>
<TE>   Given the growing broadband audience, some online broadcasters
say, the Internet could increase the IOC's take. The Net could cater
to specialized tastes, offering subscriptions to events or customized
packages not available over the air.</TE>
<TE>   NBC's Olympics Web site (www.nbcolympics.com) isn't bereft of
video clips. The main features of the site, though, are schedules,
results, an exhaustive selection of athlete biographies and written
explanations of the events. It's an approach designed to enhance the
TV programs, not compete with them, Feuer said.</TE>
<TE>   The network learned from the Sydney, Australia, games that the
Internet "just paled in comparison [to the TV] as a business
proposition, in terms of traffic and in terms of revenue," said Gary
Zenkel, executive vice president for NBC Olympics.</TE>
<TE>   "And by the way, the costs were very, very high."</TE>

<HD>Fiorina's Fervor</HD>
<DH>HP's chief talks about her sales pitch for the Compaq
merger.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOSEPH MENN</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>PALO ALTO</DL>
<LD>Two and a half years ago, new Hewlett-Packard Co. Chief Executive
Carly Fiorina was the belle of corporate America, an engaging
marketing whiz who had just become the first woman to lead one of the
30 blue-chip companies in the Dow Jones industrial average.</LD>
<LD>   As the glamorous outsider reorganized the sleepy Silicon Valley
powerhouse, HP's stock fell by more than half. The honeymoon ended.
And now Fiorina is consumed by a proxy fight with one of her own
directors, founder's heir Walter Hewlett, over her proposed
$24-billion takeover of rival Compaq Computer Corp.</LD>
<LD>   Many Wall Street analysts have condemned what would be the largest
technology merger in history, likening it to a pair of listing ships
lashing themselves together. About 18% of HP shares have been pledged
against the deal.</LD>
<TE>   But in the last two weeks, Fiorina's sales pitch has begun to take
hold. The stock prices of HP and Compaq show investors believe the
merger they assumed would collapse is more likely than before to win
approval.</TE>
<TE>   Times staff writer Joseph Menn caught up with Fiorina over the
weekend at HP's corporate headquarters in Palo Alto, where her voice,
flecked with the remnants of a New York accent, was hoarse from
near-constant talks with investors. Here are excerpts from that
interview.</TE>
<TE>   Question: How many HP shareholders have you personally spoken to
since this began, and what have been their reactions?</TE>
<TE>   Answer: Our top 100-plus for sure, and the sense I'm getting is
momentum is going our way. We are increasingly confident we will win
this vote [which probably will be held in] early spring.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Q: The history of large technology mergers is not pretty. In some
of your more recent proxy filings you say that this merger will be
more like Exxon and Mobil than, say Compaq and Digital Equipment.
That seems like a leap. Is the industry so mature that it's easier to
merge now?</TE>
<TE>   A: If you look at industries where mergers have worked, they are
situations where similar companies come together in a consolidating
industry.... In this case, Compaq-HP is once again two like
businesses in an industry that clearly is consolidating.</TE>
<TE>   The reason like businesses are important to a merger is, first,
you understand each other's businesses. When you understand each
other's businesses, the integration issues, while large, are
manageable. And as well, you have an opportunity to advance your
market position and take costs out at the same time. Most [previous]
high-tech mergers were where a company was diversifying, not
consolidating, which means not only did they not understand each
other, but there was also less opportunity to get costs out.</TE>
<TE>   Secondly, most tech mergers have been done at the tops of markets.
That means you pay a very high price. We bought near the bottom.</TE>
<TE>   And we picked a time when the market was moving slowly. Customers
are not ripping out the infrastructure and making big new purchase
decisions. They are taking their time, which means we have time to
get our product line road map together. It also means your employee
base is much more stable.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Q: Even before Compaq, you were in the midst of one of the most
dramatic, far-reaching restructurings of a modern technology company.
You said it was going to be a long process. Aren't you trying to do
too much too soon?</TE>
<TE>   A: We have, I think, executed very well on that program. It's hard
to see in the middle of a tech downturn. Consolidating our product
lines, streamlining our processes, creating a unified face to the
customers--those are critically important steps. It wasn't too much
too fast. It was critical. And those changes have been in preparation
for what we are doing now. We could not have attempted this merger a
year ago, but we can execute it now.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Q: How did this company get in such dire straits that the only way
out is what is admittedly a risky proposition?</TE>
<TE>   A: I would not describe this company as in dire straits. I would
describe this company as having some problems it needs to solve and
some opportunities it needs to capitalize on. Our PC business as a
stand-alone business is neither viable nor profitable. We have to
solve that problem. Our [Windows] NT server business is losing money
and losing momentum. Services needs more scope, scale and reach.</TE>
<TE>   The merger with Compaq is a decisive move, instead of a series of
eight or 10 moves. Doing it once and doing it thoroughly is a lot
easier. Here you have an opportunity to grow more quickly in the
growth areas, to advance our market position to leadership across the
board and to get our cost structure in line. That's a compelling
opportunity.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Q: When you met with employees last week, you said that though
there would be 15,000 jobs cut if the merger goes through, 36,000
people who work in unprofitable businesses might be at risk if the
merger doesn't go through. What's Plan B?</TE>
<TE>   A: It's important for everyone to understand that not doing this
merger has its risks as well. Bill [Hewlett] and Dave [Packard]
wisely put profit as their very first corporate objective for HP.
Profit is the foundation for job preservation. We have struggled with
the profitability levels of our enterprise and our computing
businesses for years.</TE>
<TE>   With or without this merger, we have to find a way to improve. The
board of directors has spent 21/2 years looking at a whole series of
alternatives. Frankly, we've looked at every alternative our critics
have come up with. None of them, including doing nothing, is as good.
If this merger were to be voted down, we would go back and reevaluate
all of those alternatives.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Q: Tell me about an investor you met who was initially skeptical
and then came away convinced.</TE>
<TE>   A: What tips people is understanding what we get in the enterprise
space. Compaq is the No. 1 supercomputing company in the world.
Compaq is the leading storage company in the world. Compaq has a
$7-billion services business. They aren't just a PC company. That's a
big "Aha" for people.</TE>

<HD>Paying a Price for Free Shipping?</HD>
<DH>Amazon's offer of no-cost delivery for orders of more than
$99 may only heighten consumer expectations of online merchants,
analysts say.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRISTINE FREY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>After aggressively cutting costs to achieve its first profit,
Amazon.com Inc. is hoping to boost sales by offering free shipping
indefinitely for big-ticket orders.</LD>
<LD>   The new promotion was overshadowed last month when the company
posted a profit of $5million, or 1 cent a share. Though free shipping
offers have cost online retailers millions of dollars in the
past--and even forced some to close--most analysts agree that the
move should increase business for the company.</LD>
<LD>   "If it's not working ... you better believe they'll drop it, but I
think they've done enough analysis and seen enough historically to
know that this is the right thing to do right now," said George
Sutton, managing director of RBC Capital Markets. "My guess is we'll
see a substantial impact on the amount of business that [Amazon]
does."</LD>
<TE>   The shipping promotion will cost the company, but Amazon
spokeswoman Kristin Schaefer said lower operating costs have allowed
Amazon to pass the savings on to the consumer.</TE>
<TE>   "It will be an investment for us in the short term," Schaefer
said. "But in the long term, we've learned that if you lower prices
it drives volume."</TE>
<TE>   The company would not say how much it will spend on shipping.</TE>
<TE>   With the new promotion, shipping is free for orders of more than
$99, though shipping times are three to five days longer than
standard ground shipping. The offer excludes some items sold on the
site, including products purchased through the company's partnerships
with Target Corp. and Circuit City Group.</TE>
<TE>   Amazon offered a similar shipping promotion during the holiday
season.</TE>
<TE>   Though free shipping is the leading incentive for people to buy
online, Amazon's minimum price for receiving it may be too high to
draw some consumers, especially now that the holiday season is over,
said Ken Cassar, a senior analyst with Jupiter Media Metrix. Barnes &amp;
Noble Inc., for instance, offers free shipping for orders of two or
more items.</TE>
<TE>   However, unless a company increases its prices when it offers free
shipping, it must establish a reasonable price to avoid losing its
profit margin, Cassar said.</TE>
<TE>   For example, when online retailer Kozmo.com offered one-hour
delivery for movies and junk food ordered online, it originally did
not set a minimum purchase amount. As a result, Kozmo.com had to
deliver small orders--sometimes nothing more than a pack of chewing
gum--free, Cassar said. Although it later established a minimum order
amount, the company eventually went out of business.</TE>
<TE>   "You can't win at low order sizes," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Since Amazon has traditionally offered free-shipping promotions
when business is slow, the company may have to establish other
promotions to encourage traffic, such as lowering the minimum price
for getting free shipping or offering free gift wrapping, Sutton
said. However, some analysts say the promotion, intended to spur
business during a usually slow post-holiday season, will not last.</TE>
<TE>   "This is temporary," said Walter Loeb, president of Loeb
Associates. "Longer term, I think we will see reasonable but very
firm shipping charges."</TE>
<TE>   Regardless of how long Amazon extends its promotion, repeated
offers of free shipping from online merchants may increase what
consumers expect from them.</TE>
<TE>   "Whatever the answer turns out to be, the online consumer is
increasingly coming to believe that shipping is something that they
don't necessarily have to pay for, which may be dangerous for
everyone," Cassar said. "Except, I guess, for the consumers."</TE>

<HD>Funding Up for New Ventures</HD>
<DH>Investments: Slight increase reverses a downward trend that
began in mid-2000, survey shows.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>E. SCOTT RECKARD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>After plunging for more than a year, venture capital investment
stabilized during the fourth quarter in Southern California and the
nation, with fledgling biotechnology and software firms attracting
more funding, according to a survey to be released today.</LD>
<LD>   Across the country, venture capital firms pumped $7.1 billion into
856 entrepreneurial ventures, up from $7 billion in the third
quarter, when 810 ventures received funds, the Venture Economics data
service reported.</LD>
<LD>   In Los Angeles and Orange counties, investment rose to $412million
from $357 million, with 46 ventures receiving financing in each
quarter.</LD>
<TE>   Although the figures reversed a downward trend that began in
mid-2000, levels remain far below the giddy peaks of earlier that
year, when Internet mania reigned. Venture capital firms pumped $99.6
billion into businesses in 2000, but the funding tumbled to $36.5
billion last year.</TE>
<TE>   Still, "the free-fall is over and we've landed on higher ground,"
said Tracy Lefteroff, global managing partner for venture capital at
PricewaterhouseCoopers, which helped sponsor the survey.</TE>
<TE>   Investment tailed off in the overextended telecommunications and
networking equipment businesses and in the computer chip industry,
which has been in one of its periodic downturns. But software
companies attracted 22.5% of the total investments in the fourth
quarter, up from 16.9% in the third quarter.</TE>
<TE>   "There are a lot of interesting companies in that space," said
Bruce R. Hallett, managing partner at Miramar Venture Capital in
Newport Beach, a new fund that has raised $80 million, half of it
from Broadcom Corp. co-founder Henry Samueli.</TE>
<TE>   The life sciences sector--biotech, medical devices and health
care--proved attractive to investors as well. These companies
attracted 18.5% of the total investments last year, more than double
their share two years earlier.</TE>
<TE>   "Nothing's exactly hot these days, but health care is warm," said
Nicholas Binkley of Forrest Binkley &amp; Brown, a fund with offices in
San Diego and Orange counties that invests in early- and later-stage
tech companies and provides expansion capital to smaller
manufacturers.</TE>
<TE>   Binkley said health care had come into vogue mainly because the
sector had been overlooked during the years when Internet
entrepreneurs dominated investors' attention.</TE>
<TE>   By contrast, retailing and distribution attracted only 10% of
venture investments last year, down from 18.4% a year earlier,
reflecting the fallout in e-retailing over the  last 18 months.</TE>
<TE>   Most venture capitalists spent last year deciding whether already
funded companies should be nursed back to health or be allowed to
die--freeing funds to be pumped into the survivors.</TE>
<TE>   But now, "money is starting to loosen up a little," Binkley said.</TE>
<TE>   Pressures to cut costs and raise capital for already funded
companies "didn't leave a whole lot of time for venture capitalists
to look for new opportunities," said Jeanne Metzger, a vice president
for business development at the National Venture Capital Assn. "But
in the fourth quarter, especially December, their time was starting
to free up."</TE>
<TE>   Venture capitalists also are putting more emphasis on investing in
companies with proprietary new technologies, said Gregory Njoes, a
PricewaterhouseCoopers audit partner for technology firms from
Pasadena to Santa Barbara. "They're making sure there's really
something there," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The slowdown intensified as investors demanded larger stakes in
companies in return for capital. Owners and previous investors
resisted new funding under terms that would have significantly
diluted their ownership.</TE>
<TE>   But experts say that has begun to change as the need for new funds
at surviving companies becomes acute.</TE>
<TE>   Metzger said the consensus among her association's 450 members
seems to be that the economy is slowly improving and the stock
market's appetite for initial public offerings is growing stronger as
well. IPOs, which allow venture capitalists to cash out at a profit,
had come to a near standstill before last quarter, she pointed out.
There were 14 venture-backed IPOs in the fourth quarter, compared
with only five the previous quarter, she said.</TE>
<TE>   But Metzger doesn't expect a significant increase in venture
investment until perhaps the second quarter.</TE>
<TE>   "What we've seen overall so far is a stabilization of venture
investing after several quarters of significant decline--a bottoming
out and slight uptick," she said.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>When the going got tough at Compton Dominguez High last summer in the
wake of several shake-ups within the boys' basketball program, the
tough got going all right. Four standouts who were expected to return
transferred to programs with better prospects.</LD>
<LD>   A fifth standout, senior Keion Kindred, stayed. And he hasn't
regretted the decision, even though Dominguez is only a cracked shell
of the team that last season won its third consecutive state Division
II title.</LD>
<LD>   "It's been a struggle," acknowledged Kindred, who has already
endured more losses this season (11) than he did in his three
previous varsity seasons combined (nine). "I miss that talent. But
I'm doing my best."</LD>
<TE>   Kindred's best may be enough to keep Dominguez (12-11, 7-1 San
Gabriel Valley League) in the hunt for an eighth consecutive Southern
Section title. This season, the Dons are in Division III-AA, which
does not contain a single team ranked in The Times' top 25.</TE>
<TE>   Kindred, who is waiting until the spring to announce his college
decision, is averaging 25.1 points, 6.3 rebounds and 5.3 assists as a
6-foot-4 point guard charged with getting his teammates involved in
the offensive flow.</TE>
<TE>   But his most important role may be as a respected figure, someone
who took a stand in the face of adversity. Kindred stayed put even
though teammates Bobby Jones (now at Long Beach Poly), Darius Sanders
and Saul Lankster III (Compton Centennial) and Samir Hernandez
(Gardena Serra) bolted after school administrators chose not to
retain interim coach Steve Singleton or reinstate former coach
Russell Otis. The latter was cleared last spring of wrongdoing in a
sexual molestation case brought by a former player.</TE>
<TE>   "I take my hat off to him," Otis said of Kindred, whom he still
speaks with almost every day. "He was facing a big challenge coming
back without teammates he played with all of his high school career,
and I think he handled it well. The leadership was thrust on him and
I think he has showed great character."</TE>
<TE>   Kindred's decision to stay wasn't an easy one. He considered
transferring to Crenshaw after playing with the Cougars over the
summer.</TE>
<TE>   Kindred's mother, Darlene Walker, implored him to stay, saying he
needed to endure the difficult circumstances if he wanted to grow
character. He agreed.</TE>
<TE>   "My heart was with Dominguez, so I stayed," Kindred said.</TE>
<TE>   Don Coach Mack Calvin said he has been impressed since first
meeting Kindred, when the team captain vowed to lead Dominguez to
another state title.</TE>
<TE>   In truth, the Dons have had more downs than ups this season.
Dominguez had a 62-game league winning streak ended on a
buzzer-beater against Downey and suffered lopsided losses to Fairfax
and Long Beach Poly. Westchester thumped the Dons, 105-54.</TE>
<TE>   "That was an embarrassment to the program as a whole," Kindred
said. "Dominguez losing by 50 points? Unheard of."</TE>
<TE>   Still, if the Dons need inspiration during the playoffs, they can
look to Kindred, who maintains a sunny demeanor during the toughest
times.</TE>
<TE>   "If he was going to leave, I was going to leave," said Dominguez
guard Jason Murdock, another holdover from last season. "I give him
much respect for being a true Don, stepping up and being loyal to his
school."</TE>
<TE>   A triumph to remember: Santa Ana Mater Dei Coach Gary McKnight
will probably pick up his 600th victory next week in the first round
of the Southern Section Division II-AA playoffs, but the milestone
win probably won't compare to No. 598.</TE>
<TE>   That victory was achieved in stunning fashion Saturday night at
the Pyramid in Long Beach when the Monarchs upset nationally
top-ranked Mouth of Wilson (Va.) Oak Hill Academy, 84-72, to end the
Warriors' 67-game winning streak.</TE>
<TE>   Even though Mater Dei had reeled off 13 consecutive victories
before Saturday, few thought it could challenge Oak Hill. Remember,
the Monarchs were 7-4 earlier in the season after suffering three
losses in a tournament in Oregon.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't expect this from this young team," McKnight said after
posting his first victory over Oak Hill.</TE>
<TE>   Guard Wesley Washington, who led Mater Dei with 25 points, said
the Monarchs (21-4) are back in the national spotlight because of
their unselfishness.</TE>
<TE>   "We've been playing as a team since Oregon," Washington said.</TE>
<TE>   Said center Harrison Schaen: "We're a family this year. We act as
a unit."</TE>
<TE>   Oak Hill Coach Steve Smith, whose Warriors (25-1) have lost in
their last two appearances at the Pyramid, said he might not bring
his team back to the Nike Extravaganza because of the toll the
late-season cross-country trip has taken on his players.</TE>
<TE>   "Two years ago, we didn't have any legs," said Smith, whose team
skipped the event last season. "[Saturday], we weren't mentally into
the game."</TE>
<TE>   Bold statement: Schaen said the Monarchs, No. 1 in The Times'
rankings, are the best team in Southern California, even though they
won't get a chance to prove it against No. 2 Westchester. "I'll go
play them at Venice Beach at the outdoor courts if we have to,"
Schaen said.</TE>
<TE>   And finally: In another noteworthy upset, Los Angeles Summit View

<HD>This Still Won't Be Last He Sees of Jordan</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Bud Shaw of the Cleveland Plain Dealer has seen Michael Jordan's act
before, and he expects to see it again: "A prediction: In 20 years
when he he beats the Cavs at age 59, he will score on a half-court
shot."</LD>
<LD>   Jordan, closing in on 39, and playing for the Washington Wizards,
defeated the Cavaliers on Thursday night in Cleveland with an 18-foot
jump shot at the buzzer. In 1989, while playing for the Chicago
Bulls, he defeated the Cavaliers, 101-100, with a buzzer beater in a
series-clinching NBA playoff game.</LD>
<LD>   Shaw: "For Jordan, Cleveland is a casino where the dealer keeps
handing out blackjack. It's a slot machine that pours pure silver
uninterrupted. It's Willy Wonka's Chocolate Factory."</LD>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   More Jordan: Bill Suda in the San Diego Union-Tribune: "Air Jordan
is taking a huge leap--to $200 for a pair of the Nike hoop shoes.</TE>
<TE>   "Packed in a metallic silver briefcase instead of a shoebox, the
Air Jordan XVII arrives in shoe stores next weekend, accompanied by a
$10-million national ad campaign with TV spots from Spike Lee."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Trivia time: Who holds the Laker record for most steals in a game?</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Contrasting styles: Bill Lyon of the Philadelphia Inquirer
commenting on the coaches in Sunday's Super Bowl game: "Mike Martz is
to offense what the lit match is to lighter fluid.</TE>
<TE>   "Bill Belichick is to defense what the Pennsylvania Turnpike is to
transportation. One lane here, orange cone there, slow, no exit,
under construction, take alternate route.</TE>
<TE>   "Martz is the Incinerator. He turns you to ashes. Belichick is the
Detour. He gets you lost and confused."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Staggering statistic: USA Today reports that "More than half the
adult U.S. population will bet on the Super Bowl." The source for
this information was USA Today's own odds-making analyst, Danny
Sheridan.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Beats working: Rick Morrissey of the Chicago Tribune, commenting
on the loneliest man in football: "This is John Baker, the Ram
punter. St. Louis leads the NFL in first downs, total yards and
kickoffs.</TE>
<TE>   "Baker punted a measly 43 times. He's as necessary as the Adam's
apple. Baker says, 'It's a great job.'"</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Stanford connection: Bud Geracie in the San Jose Mercury News:
"More mind-blowing than Casey Jacobsen's 49-point game Thursday night
is the thought that somebody [Hank Luisetti] scored 50 in a game in
1938."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   What did you expect? Mark Spector in the Edmonton Journal on
Saturday's NHL All-Star game at Staples Center:</TE>
<TE>   "Typical L.A.--this game had Jewel, Matthew Perry and Goldie Hawn,
yet when you boil down the actual game it offers very little
substance."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Trivia answer: Jerry West of the Lakers with 10 against Seattle on
Dec. 7, 1973. It was an NBA record at the time.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   And finally: Jane Kaczmarek, a Wisconsin native and star of Fox's
"Malcolm in the Middle," on why she didn't care much about Super Bowl
XXXVI, which preceded her show Sunday: "I stopped watching football
when Vince Lombardi died."</TE>

<HD>A Loss Is the Bottom Line</HD>
<DH>Pro basketball: Despite missing Brand and having a tired
team in 104-91 defeat at Boston, Gentry avoids excuses.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELLIOTT TEAFORD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>BOSTON</DL>
<LD>So what if the Clippers didn't have their best player available for
Sunday's game against the Boston Celtics. So what if they also didn't
have their second-best player. Or their top backup point guard.</LD>
<LD>   And big deal if they played Saturday night in Atlanta against the
Hawks and didn't arrive at their Boston hotel until 2 a.m.</LD>
<LD>   Clipper Coach Alvin Gentry loathes excuses. He wasn't about to
bemoan the rash of injuries that has swept through his team this
season. He refused to wail about the difficulties of NBA travel.</LD>
<TE>   The bottom line was that the Clippers lost to the Celtics, 104-91,
before an announced crowd of 15,025 at the FleetCenter. Rather than
blame injuries or fatigue for the loss, Gentry praised the Celtics.</TE>
<TE>   "We got outplayed," he said after the Clippers lost their second
game in less than 24 hours to drop to 24-25 overall and 2-3 on this
season-high seven-game trip. "We had no answers for Antoine Walker
and Paul Pierce."</TE>
<TE>   Walker scored 27 points and Pierce had 24 for Boston. Michael
Olowokandi led the Clippers with 27 points and 15 rebounds.</TE>
<TE>   There was no question that it would have been a different game if
the Clippers had Elton Brand at power forward, Lamar Odom at small
forward and Keyon Dooling backing up point guard Jeff McInnis.</TE>
<TE>   But they weren't available because of injuries.</TE>
<TE>   Brand sat out for the first time this season because of a bruised
left hip. Odom will be sidelined at least another month because of a
sprained right wrist. Dooling has been out since Nov. 14 because of a
sprained ankle.</TE>
<TE>   The Clippers soldiered on without them, welcoming the return of
swingman Corey Maggette from a two-game absence because of a strained
left knee. Maggette had 12 points and six rebounds in 32 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   The Clippers made a game of it for three quarters before falling
to the fresher, hungrier Celtics. Boston's victory ended a three-game
losing streak. In the final analysis, the Clippers needed to be
nearly flawless and they were not after chasing Walker and Pierce
around the parquet floor all afternoon.</TE>
<TE>   Pressed about missing Brand, who is said to be day to day, Gentry
said, "Obviously, we missed the guy. It's not an excuse. If we have
enough bodies to line up and play, then we'll line up and play.
Obviously, Elton is an important guy for us. He's our leading scorer
and rebounder."</TE>
<TE>   Brand, averaging 18.9 points and 11.2 rebounds, injured himself
earlier in the season while diving for a loose ball. He aggravated
the injury by doing the same thing in the Clippers' victory Thursday
at San Antonio.</TE>
<TE>   He warmed up before Sunday's game but decided against playing
because "the explosiveness wasn't there. I couldn't jump." Of sitting
out he added, "I felt bad. It was a helpless feeling. I don't think I
could have made that much of a difference."</TE>
<TE>   Harold Jamison replaced him in the starting lineup Sunday. He had
two points and four rebounds in 14 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   Brand will have his high school jersey retired in a ceremony
tonight in Peekskill, N.Y., then test his hip again at the morning
shootaround before the Clippers play Tuesday against the Knicks at
Madison Square Garden.</TE>
<TE>   Without Brand, the Clippers relied heavily on the hot-shooting
Olowokandi, who matched his career high for the second time in five
games. He also had 27 in the Clippers' overtime loss Jan. 28 against
the Memphis Grizzlies.</TE>
<TE>   The Clippers led, 27-25, by the end of the first quarter, trailed,
54-50, by the half and were down, 81-78, after three quarters. And
they were within 83-80 with 9:15 to play.</TE>
<TE>   But Boston's Erick Strickland made two free throws, Walter McCarty
made a three-point basket and Walker drove for two hoops. Walker then
made a 17-foot jumper to cap a 14-5 run that propelled the Celtics to
a 97-85 lead with five minutes left.</TE>
<TE>   The Clippers were unable to cut the deficit to less than double
digits the rest of the way.</TE>
<TE>   "It could have been fatigue," Olowokandi said of the Clippers'
lack of a finishing kick. "It could have been our defense. It could
have been a whole bunch of things. We just didn't come up with the
stops when we needed to come up with the stops. We were unable to
execute offensively when we needed to.</TE>
<TE>   "And when you can't do those two things down the stretch, you
don't have a chance to win the basketball game."</TE>

<HD>Olowokandi's Work Paying Off</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>BOSTON</DL>
<LD>Day after day, center Michael Olowokandi has worked on his moves with
assistant coach Igor Kokoskov monitoring every pump fake, jump shot
and hook shot.</LD>
<LD>   If the last five games are any indication, the extra tutoring has
paid off. He had 27 points and 15 rebounds in the Clippers' 104-91
loss Sunday to the Boston Celtics for his third consecutive
double-double. He has averaged 19.6 points and 10.6 rebounds in the
first five games on the Clippers' seven-game trip.</LD>
<LD>   "The guy has been playing great for us," Clipper Coach Alvin
Gentry said. "If you go back and look at his past 15 or 16 games, you
know he's had impressive stats."</LD>
<TE>   With Elton Brand sidelined  by a bruised left hip, Olowokandi
became the Clippers' go-to guy. They dropped the ball into Olowokandi
on the low block and he made the Celtics pay with a variety of hook
shots and jumpers.</TE>
<TE>   Olowokandi's best move was a drive along the right baseline,
rocketing past a helpless Vitaly Potapenko to deliver a thunderous
dunk in the first half. Olowokandi led the Clippers with 17 points in
the first half, making eight of 10 shots and one free throw.</TE>
<TE>   "I came out with a lot of energy and I got the ball early in the
[first] quarter and I just tried to sustain it as much as I could,"
said Olowokandi, who averages 8.3 points and 8.6 rebounds.</TE>
<TE>   The only fault Gentry could find with Olowokandi's play Sunday was
that he didn't get the ball enough.</TE>
<TE>   "We've got to do a better job of getting him the ball when he's
going like that," Gentry said. "It doesn't matter if they're fronting
him or not. I thought he was doing pretty well."</TE>
<TE>   Gentry says Olowokandi is feeding off his newfound confidence.</TE>
<TE>   "Igor has been working with him on his footwork," Gentry said.
"He's very confident and not rushing things. When you start playing
with confidence, then you feel confident every time out there."</TE>
<TE>   Point guard Keyon Dooling continues to make progress after
suffering a badly sprained left ankle that has sidelined him since
Nov. 14. The next step is a full-speed practice.</TE>
<TE>   "We need to keep pressing him a little more," Gentry said. "His
ankle has healed. There's nothing else that can happen to it now."</TE>

<LD>   What: "The Fighting Irish on the Air"</LD>
<LD>   Author: Paul F. Gullifor</LD>
<TE>   Publisher: Diamond Communications, South Bend, Ind.</TE>
<TE>   Price: $29.95</TE>
<TE>   Much has been written about the legend and lore of Notre Dame
football. And now there is a book about the rich history of the
broadcasting of Notre Dame football.</TE>
<TE>   This well-researched, 225-page hardcover book goes back to the
days before radio, when Western Union telegraphs were used to provide
game reports. The reader is taken through the early days of radio, to
Joe Boland and the Irish Radio network, Mutual's exclusive radio
deal, the birth of television, Lindsey Nelson and tape-delayed
telecasts, the NCAA and the College Football Assn., and finally to
Notre Dame's current and controversial contract with NBC.</TE>
<TE>   But the book covers more than just Notre Dame broadcasting. In the
foreword Dick Enberg writes: "While this book is about Notre Dame, in
a broader sense, this is really about the evolution of sports
broadcasting in America."</TE>
<TE>   The author, a native of South Bend, Ind., attended Indiana State
and earned a Ph.D. in communications from Missouri. He is an
associate professor at Bradley University, where he teaches courses
in electronic media.</TE>
<TE>   Gullifor interviewed dozens of the principals involved in the
various broadcasting deals, and also talked with those who have
broadcast Notre Dame football.</TE>
<TE>   He may overdo it in his praise of Notre Dame announcers,
particularly Tony Roberts, but mostly Gullifor takes an objective
look at his topic.</TE>
<TE>   There is no question he is a Notre Dame fan, but that doesn't
prevent him from presenting the negative side of some of the school's
deals, particularly the NBC deal.</TE>
<TE>   In 1990, Notre Dame broke off from the CFA, whose members were
schools outside the Pacific 10 and Big Ten, to make a deal on its own
worth nearly $40 million over five years. The NBC contract is
currently worth about $50 million over five years, 2001-2005.</TE>

<KH>DUCK REPORT</KH>
<HD>Rucchin Slowly Working Way Back</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Center Steve Rucchin, sidelined nearly three months because of a
stress fracture in his left ankle, took another step Sunday. While
his Mighty Duck teammates were rushing off to watch the Super Bowl
after practice, Rucchin was taking the ice to skate.</LD>
<LD>   He wore no equipment, only sweat clothes, and was not going to
stay out long. But for the last week he has gingerly stepped onto the
ice, as the next step in returning from his injury.</LD>
<LD>   "I'm just going to go out and flip the puck around to see if I
remember how to do that," Rucchin said. "Hopefully soon I can go out
and do some drills."</LD>
<TE>   Rucchin has missed 40 games since hitting the ice to block a shot
against Dallas on Nov. 11. He suffered a stress fracture in his
ankle, which later needed surgery when doctors discovered it was not
healing properly.</TE>
<TE>   It is the second consecutive season that Rucchin has missed a
large portion of the season because of injuries. He missed 66 games
last season.</TE>
<TE>   Rucchin, the Ducks' top line center, hopes to return soon after
the Olympic break, but has no timetable.</TE>
<TE>   If Rucchin is able to play the final quarter of the season it will
help Duck management decide whether to re-sign the 31-year-old.
Rucchin is in the last year of a four-year, $9.2-million contract.</TE>
<TE>   "Obviously, this has been a disappointing season and I hope I can
play the last two months," Rucchin said. "But it's nothing I can get
down about. My main focus is to help the team. But when you have been
out as long as I have, you sit around and think about stupid things
and the contract has come to mind."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Ducks, who won five consecutive games heading into the
All-Star break, held an informal workout Sunday, going about 45
minutes without coaches.</TE>
<TE>   Assistant captain Dan Bylsma and veterans Jason York and Keith
Carney pushed the Ducks through drills and a short four-on-four
scrimmage. Coach Bryan Murray observed off the ice.</TE>
<TE>   Team captain Paul Kariya was the only player absent, as he had the
day off after playing in Saturday's All-Star game.</TE>
<TE>   "Things are going to get better here and they are going to get
better not because some outside forces are involved," Bylsma said.
"It's going to get better because things happen from within and we
decide to do it as a team. Guys took control out there, Jason York,
Keith Carney calling drills. It's going to get better because we make
it better, not because some one waves a magic wand."</TE>

<HD>Heineken Goes to Who Els?</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Ernie Els brushed off a mid-round challenge from Greg Norman to
complete a start-to-finish victory Sunday in the Heineken Classic at
Melbourne, Australia.</LD>
<LD>   In cool, blustery conditions, Els led from the first round to the
last at the Royal Melbourne composite course to close with a
three-under-par 69 for a 17-under 271.</LD>
<LD>   That gave him a five-shot victory over David Howell, who shot a
68, Peter Fowler (67) and Peter O'Malley (70).</LD>
<TE>   "This is a big win for me," Els said. "I was very nervous--the
greens here are fantastic, but they're very quick. I knew I had a big
lead, but it can go fast."</TE>
<TE>   Norman birdied five of six holes through No. 10 to pull within two
shots of Els, but a run of pars and bogeys on Nos. 15 and 16 put him
out of contention.</TE>
<TE>   John Jacobs drove into a water hazard on the final hole but
escaped with a one-stroke victory in the rain-shortened Senior PGA
Tour's Royal Caribbean Classic at Key Biscayne, Fla.</TE>
<TE>   Jacobs salvaged a par and closed with a six-under for an 11-under
133. He won for the fourth time on the senior tour.</TE>
<TE>   Sharing second place in the $1.45-million event were Isao Aoki
(64), Bruce Fleisher (68) and Tom Watson (66). Aoki, runner-up last
year, had the day's best round.</TE>
<TE>   The tournament, the first full-field event this year, was reduced
to 36 holes after rain washed out Friday's round.</TE>
<TE>   Retief Goosen had seven birdies en route to a six-under 66 to win
the Dimension Data Pro-Am at Sun City, South Africa, by three strokes
over Scott Drummond.</TE>
<TE>   Goosen, coming off a victory in the Johnnie Walker Challenge at
Perth, Australia, used good iron play to break out of a third-round
tie with Drummond. Goosen had one bogey Sunday, at No. 5, on the
7,042-yard Gary Player Country Club course.</TE>
<TE>   Jaco van Zyl closed with a 69 to finish third at 273, and Tjaart
van der Walt had a 67 to finish fourth at 274.</TE>

<HD>Redattore Is a Real Stunner</HD>
<DH>Horse racing: Mandella's grass specialist surprises in San
Antonio Handicap, setting up possible shot at the Big 'Cap.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BOB MIESZERSKI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The last two times trainer Richard Mandella won the San Antonio
Handicap, the hall of famer followed with a win in the Santa Anita
Handicap.</LD>
<LD>   Although he won the two races with three horses (Gentlemen, Siphon
and Malek) in 1997 and '98, Mandella may be able to accomplish the
feat with the same thoroughbred this year.</LD>
<LD>   Redattore, who has spent most of his career racing on grass, may
have earned himself a spot in the $1-million Big 'Cap on March 2
after his half-length win Sunday over 5-2 second choice Euchre in the
$250,000 San Antonio.</LD>
<TE>   Redattore, the 7-year-old son of Roi Normand and owned by
Brazilian Luiz Alfredo Taunay, paid $25.40 after his upset in the
Grade II. Ridden by Alex Solis, who had last won the San Antonio 10
years ago with Ibero, Redattore, who was never far off the pace set
by Euchre, completed the 11/8 miles in 1:48 3/5.</TE>
<TE>   "He won by a half-length, but he did it very easy," Solis said. "I
waited until the eighth pole to ask him to run because I wanted to
make sure I had enough horse because I was expecting Lido Palace to
be coming at the end. I had a lot of horse the whole way and he
really gave me a good kick at the end."</TE>
<TE>   Making his first start since Nov. 24, Lido Palace, the 4-5
favorite, made for another long trip to California for jockey Jerry
Bailey. Beaten the previous two weeks by heavy favorites Siphonic and
Squirtle Squirt in local stakes races, Bailey had to settle for
fourth on the 5-year-old, who won a pair of Grade I's in New York
last year for trainer Bobby Frankel.</TE>
<TE>   "I really don't think [Lido Palace] handled this track very well,"
said Frankel, who will saddle the likely Santa Anita Handicap
favorite Mizzen Mast, who was so impressive winning the Strub Stakes
on Saturday. "That's what I was scared of, you know. I'll put him
away until New York."</TE>
<TE>   Lido Palace's failure to hit the board led to inflated show
payoffs. Of the $183,000 bet to show in the San Antonio, $157,000 was
wagered on Lido Palace, so Redattore returned $32 to show, Euchre
$11.80 and Irisheyesareflying, the 14-1 shot who was third, paid
$26.40.</TE>
<TE>   Mandella, who has had three winners the past two days at Santa
Anita after getting off to a slow start at the meet, said Redattore
will either return in the Big 'Cap or wait for the Dubai World Cup
later in March.</TE>
<TE>   "It's too early to tell what we'll do," Mandella said. "He's a
good horse. He had a foot abscess after he ran [in the Oak Tree
Breeders' Cup Mile on Oct. 7] and we had to cut part of the sole of
his foot out and it just had to grow back out.</TE>
<TE>   "He had been training well and he ran well. I told Alex just to
let him place himself."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Wooden Phone, a multiple-stakes winner last seen capturing the San
Pasqual last month, has a fractured shoulder and will be out for
several months, according to trainer Bob Baffert.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Cellars Shiraz, an 18-1 shot, became a stakes winner with a
victory over 3-1 favorite August Storm and eight others in the
$100,000 Herecomesthebride Stakes Sunday at Gulfstream Park.</TE>
<TE>   A 3-year-old Kissin Kris filly owned by Bitterroot Investments,
Inc. and trained by Bill Cesare, she completed the 11/16 miles on
turf in 1:43 1/5 under jockey Cornelio Velasquez while winning by
11/4 lengths. It was the third win in 12 starts for Cellars Shiraz.
She's Vested finished third.</TE>

<LD>   The Kings, for instance, arrived at the All-Star break only three
points behind the first-place San Jose Sharks in the Pacific Division
after a 40-point surge in December and January, one point shy of the
most productive two-month run in club history.</LD>
<LD>   If they can continue playing as they did in compiling an 18-7-4
record over the last two months, Coach Andy Murray's team has a good
chance to pass the Sharks and win only the second division
championship in team history.</LD>
<TE>   That would earn them no worse than a No. 3 playoff seeding and
home-ice advantage in the first round for the first time in 10 years.</TE>
<TE>   On the other hand, the Kings are seventh in the Western Conference
and only one point ahead of the Dallas Stars and two in front of the
Phoenix Coyotes and Vancouver Canucks in the race for the eighth
playoff slot.</TE>
<TE>   That's why Murray considers the five-game pre-Olympic run that
begins tonight against the Eastern Conference-leading Philadelphia
Flyers at Staples Center a potentially hazardous stretch for his and
other NHL teams.</TE>
<TE>   After the four-day All-Star break, the regular season resumes
today for 10 days before it is interrupted again Feb. 14 for the Salt
Lake City Games.</TE>
<TE>   "The one thing I mentioned to our team this morning was, there are
going to be some teams that I think may have some regrets about how
they play their games between now and the start of the Olympics,"
Murray said Sunday. "We want to do our part to make sure we're not
one of those teams."</TE>
<TE>   With some players perhaps holding back as they anticipate
representing their countries in the Olympics and others possibly
looking forward to a vacation after a grueling five months since the
start of training camps last fall, Murray said, "There may be some
teams that play themselves out of the playoffs."</TE>
<TE>   He is confident, however, that the Kings won't be one of them.</TE>
<TE>   "We haven't battled as hard as we have this year to go out and not
play hard now," he said. "And you hope when you play hard that you
get the right results."</TE>
<TE>   The results in December and January ranked among the best in club
history. Only the 1990-91 team, led by Wayne Gretzky, put together a
more impressive two-month run, accumulating 41 points in February and
March en route to the Kings' only division championship. The Kings
were 18-6-5 over those two months.</TE>
<TE>   "I think we are a focused team," Swedish defenseman Mattias
Norstrom, one of six Kings who will play in the Olympics, said of the
current team. "We've played some pretty good hockey of late, so I
don't think that focus is a problem at all.</TE>
<TE>   "We didn't have any problems going into the All-Star break [during
a 2-0 trip last week], so I don't know why we would have any leading
up to the Olympics."</TE>

<HD>Jackson Gives George a Nudge</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>DALLAS</DL>
<LD>In his third professional season and headed for free agency in the
summer, Devean George not only has played himself into Phil Jackson's
rotation, but into a critical role in the Laker three-peat bid.</LD>
<LD>   He has averaged more than 20 minutes, had some big offensive
moments and often draws a pivotal defensive assignment.</LD>
<LD>   In 45 games this season, George already has played more minutes
than in his first two seasons combined.</LD>
<TE>   And yet, lately, Jackson is not entirely pleased.</TE>
<TE>   "He got complacent," Jackson said. "I think he thought it was
going to be natural and fall into place. He's got to get back to
working a little bit harder. I haven't talked to him about that, so
you guys can talk to him."</TE>
<TE>   Jackson grinned warily, knowing the news would travel quickly to
George, knowing that's not exactly how he wanted to send the message.
Predictably, George was dismayed by the job review, then was 0 for
four from the field and 0 for two from the line in the Lakers' 101-94
victory over the Dallas Mavericks on Sunday, though his defense was
typically taut.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not going to score every night like I do certain games," he
said. "My niche is energy and defense. We've already got our
scorers."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Jackson intended to discuss the coming week with Shaquille O'Neal
on the flight home Sunday night. The club has considered having
O'Neal sit out Wednesday's game against the Chicago Bulls, then play
short minutes in the All-Star game.</TE>
<TE>   "We have to keep perspective of the overall season and what we're
going to be like in March, which is a grinding month for us," Jackson
said. "... If [resting it this week] is one of the things that makes
his toe not symptomatic, then he has to get after it."</TE>
<TE>   O'Neal said he has yet to reach a conclusion, but that he would be
examined today by team physicians Phil Kwong, a foot specialist, and
Steve Lombardo.</TE>

<HD>Lakers Put Dallas in Its Place</HD>
<DH>Pro basketball: O'Neal scores 31 and L.A. beats Mavericks
for 24th time in 25 meetings, 101-94, to complete a 4-1 trip.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TIM BROWN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>DALLAS</DL>
<LD>Five games in five towns in eight days ended for the Lakers late
Sunday afternoon, with Shaquille O'Neal's feet in a bucket of ice
water, with four victories and with a sense they were able to drive
themselves when absolutely necessary, a new accessory to their
fractured season.</LD>
<LD>   In a place where the home team occasionally believes it is gaining
on the two-time defending NBA champions, before a local owner who
alternately celebrated and pouted, the Lakers were again better, by
the length of O'Neal's ferocious game, swollen toe or not.</LD>
<LD>   The Lakers beat Dallas, 101-94, at American Airlines Center, where
O'Neal had 31 points and 13 rebounds, Kobe Bryant had 24 points and
10 rebounds, and O'Neal told the Mavericks about it.</LD>
<TE>   The Lakers have won five of six games, for a record of 33-12, four
wins better than last year after 45 games. They have won 24 of 25
games against the Mavericks, who at times view themselves as title
contenders, at least when their games against the Lakers have worn
off. Asked what the team owned by Mark Cuban and run by Don Nelson
could do to alter the series' course, O'Neal sighed.</TE>
<TE>   "There's nothing you can do," he said. "It's like a bad headache,
you accept two hours of [butt]-kicking and then after it's over, it's
over."</TE>
<TE>   It often starts the same with the Mavericks, who think they can,
then don't. Even when Nelson's zone defense--they played it for about
30 minutes Sunday--annoys the Lakers, even when the Lakers shoot
39.8% from the field, even when the Mavericks go frightfully big on
the front line, they don't.</TE>
<TE>   The Mavericks missed 24 of 28 three-point attempts, and All-Stars
Dirk Nowitzki and Steve Nash combined to miss 22 of 33 field-goal
attempts, and O'Neal made his free throws (seven of nine), a sight
that sucked the air out of Cuban's new, glitzy place. And so, they
think they can, and then they score 30 points in the first quarter,
and then they don't, because something almost always seems to happen.</TE>
<TE>   "Dallas is like that, Sacramento is like that, Minnesota is like
that," O'Neal said, to name a few.</TE>
<TE>   "When you're the best, everybody uses you as a measuring stick,
everybody wants to be your rival. My message to everybody is just,
'Go play.' Don't tell me what the ... you're going to do in the
paper. That'll just wake me up, every time. My feet hurt, that'll
just make me take more ... drugs, until I get right and come and
dominate.</TE>
<TE>   "If you're going to beat us, beat us. Play. Whoever wants to beat
me, I'll welcome the challenge. But play. Play like a man. Don't be
whining and crying and all that BS. Just play. You're going to beat
me, beat me. If you beat me, I'll be the first to say that."</TE>
<TE>   In a gym nearly shaking with energy, the Mavericks had their last
lead with 6:45 left in the second quarter. They tied, 76-76, with
9:45 to play, and maybe they thought they would, and then they
didn't. The Lakers scored the next six points--on O'Neal's dunk over
Shawn Bradley, on O'Neal's two free throws and on Bryant's fastbreak
dunk, set up when O'Neal blocked a shot near the arc by Michael
Finley, gathered the ball and fed Bryant.</TE>
<TE>   And maybe that bothered the Mavericks, because late in the game
Tim Hardaway shouted angry things at Bryant and Derek Fisher, and the
Lakers chuckled.</TE>
<TE>   "There's nothing worse than an old guy who's jealous," Bryant
said. "Nothing worse."</TE>
<TE>   Fisher, who had 19 points, scored six of the Lakers' final eight
points from the free-throw line. Rick Fox scored the others, also
from the line. Relegated to reserve duty just before the trip, Fisher
scored at least 19 points in three of the five games, and against the
Mavericks played 30 minutes to Lindsey Hunter's 13. Hunter has a sore
lower back.</TE>
<TE>   Robert Horry had 11 rebounds and eight assists in 34 minutes, and
Mitch Richmond had nine points and four rebounds, all in a
nine-minute run in the second quarter.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not going back to the drawing board," Nelson said. "I liked
our game plan. Maybe we're just not ready for prime time yet. Maybe
we're not ready for the Lakers. I think that time will come. I hope
it will come this year."</TE>
<TE>   Jackson was not sure it was the Lakers, as much as it was O'Neal.
Nelson's zone was supposed to stop O'Neal and force jump shots, and
still O'Neal got his, and still he made his free throws.</TE>
<TE>   "I think the power of Shaq is overwhelming inside," Jackson said.</TE>
<TE>   "He's played very well against this team, because he's used a
variety of things and we've used a variety of things.</TE>
<TE>   "He's really started to look much better at the free-throw line
and he knew today he had to really be focused, because the
possibility of having to go to the free-throw line was something he
faced.</TE>
<TE>   "I think he wanted to play well. I didn't ask him how he felt. I
asked him one time if he was tired, he said, 'No, I feel good.'"</TE>

<TE>   More of the Same</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers have won 40 of their last 43 games against the Dallas
Mavericks, and Sunday's victory moved L.A. (33-12) a game ahead of
Dallas (33-14) for the second-best record in the Western Conference.
A look at the keys to Sunday's Laker victory:</TE>
<TE>   One-Two Punches</TE>
<TE>   Shaquille O'Neal and Kobe Bryant of the Lakers got the better of
Steve Nash and Dirk Nowitzki, their Dallas counterparts. At one point
in the second half, O'Neal and Bryant had made 12 of 18 field-goal
attempts while the rest of the Lakers were only three of 28.
Comparing the production of O'Neal and Bryant to Nash and Nowitzki:</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Bench</TE>
<TE>   Derek Fisher continued his strong play as a reserve, scoring 12 of
his 19 points in the second half. Fisher is averaging 15.2 points in
the last six games as a reserve. Overall, the Laker bench outscored
Dallas', 34-21.</TE>

<TE>   In Quotes</TE>
<TE>   "We belong with the best in the West. We've showed that already
this year. We just can't beat the Lakers. That's all it is."</TE>

<LD>David Robinson may be shaking out of his season-long slump.</LD>
<LD>   Robinson had a season-high 27 points--14 coming in the fourth
quarter and overtime--with eight rebounds and seven blocked shots as
the San Antonio Spurs stopped a three-game losing streak by beating
the Orlando Magic, 105-98, Sunday at Orlando, Fla.</LD>
<LD>   Tim Duncan added 29 points, including a crucial three-point play
in overtime, and 15 rebounds as the Spurs rallied from a four-point
deficit in the final 45 seconds of regulation.</LD>
<TE>   Robinson entered the game averaging 11 points and eight rebounds
as age and nagging injuries have taken their toll. But his teammates
and coach say they've seen a fresher, better center in recent days.</TE>
<TE>   "When he gets rolling, everything gets a little bit easier,"
Duncan said. "We didn't play well, but he picked us up and took us
over the top."</TE>
<TE>   Spur Coach Gregg Popovich said: "David has been playing better and
better as the season moves along. He seems to be getting into gear,
and that's definitely a big plus for our team."</TE>
<TE>   Tracy McGrady had 26 points and a career-high 17 rebounds for
Orlando. He took a career-high 36 shots, making only 12.</TE>
<TE>   San Antonio tied it at 90 in regulation on Steve Smith's
three-point basket with 8.3 seconds to go.</TE>
<TE>   Sacramento 112, Minnesota 107--Chris Webber had 31 points and 14
rebounds at Minneapolis to help the Kings win for the 17th time in
their last 18 games.</TE>
<TE>   Mike Bibby scored 24 points and sealed the victory with 10.1
seconds left by driving and flipping up a high, arching shot over
Kevin Garnett that made it 110-105.</TE>
<TE>   Sacramento won in Minneapolis for the first time since Jan. 28,
1997--a span of nine games.</TE>
<TE>   Minnesota, led by Garnett's 32 points and 12 rebounds, lost for
the third time in 22 home games. Minnesota has lost five of its last
eight overall.</TE>
<TE>   Washington 109, Indiana 89--Michael Jordan scored 23 points, and
Richard Hamilton had 21 in his first start in six weeks at Washington
as the Wizards finally beat the Pacers.</TE>
<TE>   The Wizards had lost six in a row and 15 of 16 games to the
Pacers, including a 108-81 loss on Dec. 27, when Jordan scored a
career-low six points.</TE>
<TE>   The Wizards never trailed and took control with an 18-2 run late
in the third quarter.</TE>
<TE>   Jordan and Jalen Rose received double technical fouls with 4:11
left as they jawed while running down the court. Jordan had to be
restrained by Coach Doug Collins, and Rose was ejected because it was
his second technical of the game. Rose had been the Pacers' best
scoring threat in the second half, scoring 22 of his 27 points after
halftime.</TE>
<TE>   Hamilton, who missed 17 games because of a groin injury, had been
a reserve in his first two games back.</TE>
<TE>   Miami 94, New York 83--Alonzo Mourning scored 21 points at New
York as the Heat scored eight unanswered points late in third quarter
during a 23-10 run en route to victory.</TE>
<TE>   The Heat won for the 10th time in 12 games.</TE>
<TE>   Allan Houston had 28 points for the Knicks.</TE>
<TE>   Portland 101, Chicago 96--Bonzi Wells led seven Trail Blazers in
double figures with 19 points in a victory at Portland, Ore.</TE>
<TE>   Brad Miller had 21 points for the Bulls, who pulled within 97-93
with 49.4 seconds left but could get no closer.</TE>
<TE>   Phoenix 98, Golden State 97--Penny Hardaway scored with two
seconds left to send the Suns past the Warriors at Oakland.</TE>
<TE>   Hardaway finished with 25 points as the Suns snapped a three-game
road losing streak and overcame a 21-point deficit to sweep the
season series.</TE>
<TE>   Antawn Jamison had 27 points for the Warriors, who had taken a
97-96 lead when Larry Hughes scored on a layup with 17 seconds left.</TE>
<TE>   Charlotte 97, Memphis 79--Baron Davis had 18 points and 10 assists
at Memphis, Tenn., in the Hornets' third consecutive victory.</TE>
<TE>   Six Hornets scored in double figures as Memphis suffered its third
loss in a row. Elden Campbell led Charlotte with 19 points. Stromile
Swift led Memphis with 13 points.</TE>

<BD>From Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Top-seeded Martina Hingis won the Toray Pan Pacific tennis tournament
title for the fourth time in six years, beating Monica Seles, 7-6
(6), 4-6, 6-3, in the final Sunday at Tokyo.</LD>
<LD>   It was the second time in just over a week that Hingis defeated
Seles, following their Australian Open semifinal at Melbourne.</LD>
<LD>   Hingis was coming off a loss to Jennifer Capriati in the
Australian Open final.</LD>
<TE>   Seles led, 5-1, in the first-set tiebreaker and had two set points
after Hingis' backhand went long. But Hingis tied the score, 6-6, and

tournament got higher TV ratings than those of the NHL All-Star game.</LD>
<LD>   NBC's broadcast of the Philadelphia 76ers' 86-81 victory over the
Milwaukee Bucks, which started at 2:30 p.m. PST, drew a 3.3 overnight
rating, the highest for a sporting event Saturday.</LD>
<LD>   The Utah Jazz's 97-96 victory over the Portland Trail Blazers, on

<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It was midafternoon on Sunday, Dec. 23, and I was on a bus holding a
group of men and women selected as the torchbearers who would carry
the Olympic flame through Manhattan, a midpoint on the flame's
journey to Salt Lake City.</LD>
<LD>   Every two-tenths of a mile, the bus would stop and let one of us
off at a designated spot to wait our turn.</LD>
<LD>   Crowds lined the road, cheering the caravan and greeting each
torchbearer with special affection. Soon it was my turn, and as the
bus began to slow I looked through the window. We were passing a fire
station. There were about 10 firefighters standing there smiling. And
they were waving to us. These men and women who, since Sept. 11 have
captivated the world with their quiet courage and bravery ... they
were waving at us.</LD>
<TE>   What is it about the Olympic Games--the Olympic spirit--that has
the power to inspire us, to give us hope, even in the wake of recent
tragedies?</TE>
<TE>   If there is tangible evidence of the Olympic spirit, it must
reside in the form of the athletes--men and women from all over the
world who have, for more than a 100 years, set aside their
differences to come together in a single place, with a single
purpose--the will to be their best, the pursuit of excellence.</TE>
<TE>   When I think of the Olympic spirit, my thoughts often go back to
1980 in Lake Placid, N.Y., when that spirit was manifested in an
unheralded group of American ice hockey players who overcame
insurmountable odds to win the gold medal in what history remembers
as the "Miracle on Ice." Miracle or not, it was the fulfillment of
the dream of all athletes who have competed in the Olympic
Games--that on any given day, at a given time and place, something
magical can happen.</TE>
<TE>   I believe these Games endure because of these men and women who
enter the arena and make the attempt. In doing so, they remind us
that while not all of us will be called upon to be heroes, we can
all, through a simple act of character and courage, pursue
excellence, inspire others, and attain our own measure of greatness.</TE>
<TE>   Thankfully, these Games and these young men and women once again
will return to American soil in Salt Lake City at a time when they
are sorely needed. And the whole world can join together as we share
the joy of their friendly competition. In doing so, we will all pay
homage to the reason these Games endure--to the men and women who
have come before, who stood a step above the rest--who through their
excellence have inspired this generation of athletes who followed.
Olympic legends who have assured the Olympic spirit will endure from
Games to Games and from generation to generation.</TE>
<TE>   As Chris Witty and Jennifer Rodriguez take to the ice at the
speedskating oval in Salt Lake, they know that anything is possible
because of the accomplishments of the great Bonnie Blair. Though Bode
Miller had not been born when the 1968 Winter Games were held in
Grenoble, France, we can't help but think that he will be inspired by
the feats of Jean-Claude Killy. As we watch the beauty, grace and
athleticism of Michelle Kwan, we see figure skating as both Sonja
Henie and Dick Button intended. And as Brian Shimer rockets down the
mountain at Utah Olympic Park in his fifth Olympic Games, he honors
the great traditions of his sport forged by Eugenio Monti, Tony Nash
and Billy Fiske.</TE>
<TE>   In Salt Lake, as I mark my 50th year of documenting the Olympic
Games, I am privileged to be able to pay honor to the 10 Winter
Olympians whose greatness, courage and endurance have most inspired
me over the years. And I look forward with renewed vigor to the
opportunity to witness and be encouraged by a new generation of
Olympians.</TE>
<TE>   We don't know the names of all those who will inspire us during
these Games or those whose names will join the ranks of the legends
who have gone before. After 50 years there is only one thing I know
for certain--that all of us, athletes and spectators alike, will
leave these Games and return to our daily lives the better for it.</TE>

<HD>The Game Goes Gogel on Perez</HD>
<DH>Golf: The same player who unraveled in 2000 at Pebble Beach
wins by three when Perez's game comes apart.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>THOMAS BONK</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>PEBBLE BEACH</DL>
<LD>Just as there are spectacular ways to win, there are terrible ways to
lose, which Pat Perez reminded us Sunday at the AT&amp;T Pebble Beach
National Pro-Am.</LD>
<LD>   Tied for the lead with five holes to go, Perez knocked a ball out
of bounds on the 14th hole, then with a one-shot lead at the 18th,
hit his tee shot out of bounds again. The lesson?</LD>
<LD>   "Play better," Perez said. "Don't shoot 76 or you'll lose.</LD>
<TE>   "I'll always remember the last hole. Always. There's nothing good
coming out of this week."</TE>
<TE>   And to show that one player's adversity is another's good fortune,
Matt Gogel got paid back in the most unpredictable of ways. One shot
behind at the 18th tee, Gogel won by three shots with a 14-under 274.
Perez hit a driver at 18 with his one-shot lead, which is always a
risky proposition (see Jean Van de Velde) and the result was
predictable. The ball went far right, near the cart path and
underneath a hedge, about a foot on the wrong side of the
out-of-bounds stakes.</TE>
<TE>   While Perez was forced to walk back to the tee to try again, Gogel
steered in a 25-foot birdie putt on the famous 18th green at Pebble
Beach, raised his fist to celebrate and then waited to see what Perez
would do. What Perez did was hit his fourth shot into Carmel Bay.</TE>
<TE>   He was not happy. We know this because Perez put his club over his
knee and tried to break it. It was sort of the same reaction that
Perez had when he hit the ball out of bounds at the 14th. Perez
whacked the turf with his club, using a technique that would make a
woodchopper proud. For someone who said his game plan was to keep his
emotions in check, this fell somewhat short of a positive sign.</TE>
<TE>   The emotions were worse at the 18th. Tour officials had to clear
the gallery from the area where Perez's ball had landed because they
couldn't see the out-of-bounds stakes. Once they figured it out,
there wasn't much Perez could do except get it over with as quickly
as he could, then get off the course.</TE>
<TE>   Perez wound up with a double-bogey seven at the 14th, a
triple-bogey eight at the 18th, and finished with a four-over 76 and
a bad attitude. He complained about the wind, not being informed
about the difference between PVC pipes and the out-of-bounds stakes
at the 18th and the quality of the sand in the bunkers. But you can't
really blame him for the way he felt, not after making only five pars
all day.</TE>
<TE>   "Some things were going right," Perez said. "Other things were
going horrible.</TE>
<TE>   "I was pretty much lost out there. I didn't know what the hell was
going on."</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Gogel slipped inside with a 69, claimed his first
victory, a check for $720,000 and finally was repaid for losing this
same event on the same course on the last day two years ago. That was
when Gogel shot a 40 on the back nine and lost when Tiger Woods made
up seven shots on the last seven holes. Such an experience gave Gogel
some perspective.</TE>
<TE>   "I feel for Pat," Gogel said. "I've been in that position before.</TE>
<TE>   "Was the driver the right play?" Gogel said. "He's going to ask
himself that a thousand times."</TE>
<TE>   Perez says he knew Gogel was on the green and thought he needed to
be aggressive. Everything changed in 30 seconds, Perez said. "My ball
was out of bounds, Gogel made his putt, the crowd went crazy, and it
was a long walk back to the tee," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Lee Janzen and Andrew Magee tied for third at 10-under 278, four
shots behind Gogel.</TE>
<TE>   Gogel had a two-shot lead after Perez's misadventure at the 14th,
but Perez somehow pulled himself together with birdies at the 15th
and 17th. And when Gogel three-putted the 17th for a bogey, Perez was
back in the lead.</TE>
<TE>   "It was tough out there," Gogel said. "I'm just so proud of myself
to birdie the last hole after making bogey at 17."</TE>
<TE>   Woods, who began the day 13 shots behind Perez, finished with a
68. His rounds of 70-73-71-68 were six under and good enough for a
tie for 12th. Woods goes right back at it again this week when he
plays the Buick Invitational at Torrey Pines. Woods said he thought
he was close, admitted he had trouble on the greens but thought his
result could have been different. "A few putts here and there, a few
shots here and there," Woods said.</TE>
<TE>   Typical of Woods' day: At the par-five 14th, he hit his second
shot within a foot of out of bounds to the right, but he knocked his
third shot onto the green and made a five-footer for birdie.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm pretty close, I really am. I hit the ball pretty good today
in spurts," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "And I'm showing signs that I am improving and starting to feel a
little bit more comfortable with the [swing] moves I'm making."</TE>
<TE>   Gogel's moves are all upward. In 12 rounds this year, he has shot
par or better, he's up to No. 5 on the money list this year and
passed $2 million in career earnings. What he feels is not
redemption, said Gogel, only happy it was his turn to win this time,
no matter how it happened.</TE>

<KH>SPOTLIGHT ON WRESTLING</KH>
<HD>Coaches Debate Value of Dual Championship</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The debate whether to participate could be more heated than the
actual competition in the Southern Section dual-meet championships
Saturday.</LD>
<LD>   Some coaches, saying the duals offer little more than an increased
chance of injury to wrestlers, either withdraw their teams from the
tournament or compete with junior varsity wrestlers.</LD>
<LD>   Other coaches relish the opportunity to win a section title and,
perhaps more importantly, wrestle a few extra matches.</LD>
<TE>   "We love the duals," said Coach Arnold Alpert of Temecula Valley
High. "We just love to wrestle. We'll wrestle any time, any place, in
any format."</TE>
<TE>   The dual meets decide a team champion in each division. Teams
advance by compiling the most points in a dual meet, consisting of
matches in 14 weight classes.</TE>
<TE>   In contrast, team scores in the individual championships are
calculated based on how far wrestlers advance in their respective
divisional bracket.</TE>
<TE>   Both formats decide section titles, but the top five finishers in
the individual championships advance to the Masters meet and earn the
opportunity to go on to the state championships.</TE>
<TE>   Winning a dual-meet championship does not qualify wrestlers for
any further competition.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not that I don't like [the duals]," said Coach David Ochoa
of Covina Northview. "But at this point in the season, I'd rather be
wrestling for something that counts, not banging heads with some of
the best teams the week before the individual championships."</TE>
<TE>   Ochoa said the risk of injury in the duals is not worth
compromising a wrestler's chance of winning a more prestigious
individual title.</TE>
<TE>   He said a bad day in the duals could adversely affect a wrestler's
seeding in the individual championships.</TE>
<TE>   Alpert is unconvinced that duals increase the risk of injury.</TE>
<TE>   He said a majority of wrestling injuries occur in practice.</TE>
<TE>   "Heck, you could get hurt going to the shower," Alpert said.</TE>
<TE>   Rob Wigod, Southern Section assistant commissioner, surveyed
coaches about the possibility of eliminating the duals, but said 88%
of those responding favored keeping them.</TE>
<TE>   He is hopeful top teams will participate and is weighing the
possibility of penalizing teams that do not.</TE>
<TE>   "I suppose [the Southern Section] does have the power to penalize
those teams," Wigod said. "It could adversely affect their individual
status, for example.</TE>
<TE>   "But we have to be careful not to penalize kids for a coach's
actions."</TE>
<TE>   Location, location: The six dual-meet divisional championships
Saturday begin at 11 a.m., with the finals expected to begin at 7:15
p.m. Locations are as follows:</TE>
<TE>   Division I, Santa Ana College; Division II, Rosemead High;
Division III, Lakewood High; Division IV, Ventura High; Division V,
Upland High; Division VI, Palmdale Highland High.</TE>

<DH>Anonymous as a World Champion, Rahlves Knows Lights Go On
in Utah</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRIS DUFRESNE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Daron Rahlves is a reigning world champion in Alpine skiing, but it
might as well be tiddlywinks for all the world knows.</LD>
<LD>   U.S. skiers, of course, long ago realized that home folks really
care what they do only in televised bursts during Olympic years.</LD>
<LD>   The 9-to-5 part of it is for pride and scrapbooks.</LD>
<TE>   To wit: Rahlves' triumph last March on the super-giant slalom
slope at St. Anton, a race in which he iced the Austrians on their
home snow, was an industry win--an inside job.</TE>
<TE>   It established the American as a superstar on the World Cup
circuit but did little to improve his lot outside arctic circles.</TE>
<TE>   Safe to say, if Rahlves were Austrian, he'd be a haus-hold name in
Salzburg.</TE>
<TE>   Back home?</TE>
<TE>   Rahlves returned to a smattering of applause. Friends tossed a
party in his hometown, Truckee, Calif., popped a few champagne corks.</TE>
<TE>   Last summer, a stranger recognized Rahlves while he was dining at
a waterside restaurant in Rhode Island. Nice, but a far cry from
checking into hotels under assumed names.</TE>
<TE>   Money? Fame?</TE>
<TE>   Rahlves thought defeating the sport's two best skiers, Austria's
Hermann Maier and Stephen Eberharter, ought to have been worth at
least a set of keys from Chevrolet.</TE>
<TE>   "You win a world championship and you still can't get a damn truck
from the ski team sponsor," Rahlves cracks. "Or even a deal on it!"</TE>
<TE>   Rahlves also knows this: The world is watching now.</TE>
<TE>   It watched in 1976 when Franz Klammer on edges kept us on
edge--with help from a breathless Bob Beattie--during that harrowing
gold-medal run at Innsbruck, Austria.</TE>
<TE>   It watched in 1984, when Bill Johnson stormed the downhill at
Sarajevo. It tuned in when Alaskan Tommy Moe became Thor for a day in
Norway.</TE>
<TE>   We took a flier in 1998 when Maier took one off a jump at the
downhill course Hakuba, Japan.</TE>
<TE>   And now, bells toll for Rahlves.</TE>
<TE>   All he has worked for ticks toward Feb. 10, the day he figures to
be among the medal contenders in the Olympic downhill at Snowbasin.</TE>
<TE>   Rahlves' heart also will be racing toward the Olympic super-G on
Feb. 16, yet it is that mythical mile of downhill that makes heroes
of men.</TE>
<TE>   "It'll be the biggest race of my career, skiing at Salt Lake," he
says. "It's going to be my biggest chance to show what I have to
myself and the rest of the world."</TE>
<TE>   Pressure?</TE>
<TE>   "Oh yeah, but it's kind of cool too," he says. "It shows who's got
what it takes. There's so much at stake, a lot of people will break.
There's so much pressure, so much tension. If you come down and win
the Olympics, your life for sure is going to change."</TE>
<TE>   Rahlves hasn't won a World Cup race this season--he ranks 18th in
downhill and 10th in super-G--yet the Europeans are well aware
Americans have a history of pulling off Olympic upsets.</TE>
<TE>   And although Rahlves won't have much of a home-mountain
advantage--bad weather has drastically limited ski time on the
hill--the track favors his attacking style.</TE>
<TE>   Yet, as Rahlves recently calculated his chances of victory, he
admitted the Olympic downhill is lacking a key component: Hermann
Maier.</TE>
<TE>   The Austrian star would have been favored had a motorcycle
accident last summer not knocked him out of the Salt Lake City Games.</TE>
<TE>   And although Maier's absence figures to improve Rahlves' medal
chances, he doesn't see it that way.</TE>
<TE>   "I'd much rather have him there," he says. "There are a lot of
other guys out there who are fast, but when people look at the sport,
he's been so dominant for so long, he's sort of the icon of ski
racing. There might be a little taken away from it. I don't think
it's any less important. People say, 'It's a better chance for you
now.'</TE>
<TE>   "If that comes up I'll say, 'He was at the World Championships
last year and I beat him there.' Yeah, I'd rather have the best guy
there, so that stuff doesn't come up."</TE>
<TE>   The night before he won the world title in super-G, Rahlves
received an e-mail from former U.S. racer AJ Kitt. The last words
Kitt typed were, "Take it."</TE>
<TE>   Rahlves made the words his mantra. He has had precious few runs on
the Olympic course, but television cameras did capture one of his
training runs last spring before a World Cup downhill that was
canceled because of too much snow.</TE>
<TE>   Rahlves has gone loopy looking at the loop.</TE>
<TE>   "I've closed my eyes and gone over it a lot of times," he says. "I
just try and mentally have it played out in my head already. I feel
confident. I could get on that hill right now and feel comfortable."</TE>
<TE>   Rahlves, 28, likes to joke about how little winning the world
title has changed him, though he is more comfortable out of the
public glare.</TE>
<TE>   "Look at Picabo [Street]," Rahlves says. "She's so good with
people and the media. She's bubbly, energetic. I'm much more laid
back. I don't need the attention."</TE>
<TE>   For most of Rahlves' nine years on the U.S. ski team, attention
has not been a problem.</TE>
<TE>   He always has been more of a quiet thrill-seeker, a lonesome
lunatic when it comes to extracurricular escapades.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, the biggest fear U.S. coaches have about him is that he
will injure himself off the mountain.</TE>
<TE>   Many professional athletes have clauses in their contracts that
forbid them from skiing. Dale Stephens, the U.S. men's downhill and
super-G coach, would be happy if he could keep Rahlves on his
downhill boards.</TE>
<TE>   "There's a lot of things he probably doesn't tell us [about] some
injury he's limping with," Stephens says. "He never tells us how
exactly he got it.</TE>
<TE>   "But we recognize that's part of him. We try and make sure he's
making good decisions when he's going out, doing other activities,
and make sure he's not taking unreasonable risks. But that's part of
what makes Daron fast. He enjoys the risk, enjoys pushing the limits
a bit. You can't take that away from him."</TE>
<TE>   Risk and Rahlves have always gone hand in hand.</TE>
<TE>   Growing up in Truckee, he had a hard time keeping up with his
father, Dennis, an adventurer who lived for the thrill of a safari
hunt and loved racing motorcycles, speed-skiing and water-ski
jumping.</TE>
<TE>   "He was in the rodeo too," Rahlves says. "That's pretty intense,
just jamming, roping a cow. He's still doing it at age 55."</TE>
<TE>   Daron spent his youth playing catchup with his dad and hopes one
day to pass his daredevil gene to his own son.</TE>
<TE>   "If I had a kid, that kid's going to ride dirt bikes and I'm going
to try to kick his butt until he's stomping all over me," Rahlves
jokes.</TE>
<TE>   In 1993, between ski seasons, Daron won a world title in Jet Ski
racing.</TE>
<TE>   Another thing the U.S. ski team probably does not want to know:
Rahlves likes to go helicopter skiing in Alaska, perch himself on top
of a 3,000-foot vertical drop and roughly calculate his odds.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm gripped, concerned, like, 'How am I going to handle this?'"
Rahlves says. "You know there's high consequences. It's not being
freaking-out scared, but you have this nervousness. But you attack
it, and go for it.</TE>
<TE>   "The reward for something like that is huge."</TE>
<TE>   Rahlves was only half-joking about his ho-hum life as a ski
champion. There have been perks. He gets "kick-downs" from his
sponsors--Atomic, Sugar Bowl, Lange, Smith--and even gets to fly
business class to Europe for World Cup races.</TE>
<TE>   But he says these have been hard-fought upgrades.</TE>
<TE>   He mentions former teammate Moe.</TE>
<TE>   "He was an Olympic champion and still riding the back of the bus,
riding coach," Rahlves said. "He was just getting burned out. He
wasn't treated like someone who had achieved so much, who had brought
so much attention to the ski team. He just got burned out, I know he
did.</TE>
<TE>   "But it is better now."</TE>
<TE>   Rahlves envisions what life might be like as an Austrian ski star.</TE>
<TE>   "I'd make a couple million if I were in Austria," he says. "That's
how it is over there. Over here, it's not. I still have to buy my own
truck."</TE>
<TE>   Rahlves knows how much would change if he were to stun the Olympic
world, the way Johnson did in 1984, Moe in '94 and Street in '98.</TE>
<TE>   Rahlves has not been spectacular this World Cup season and was
ordinary when he finished 24th, 39th, 37th and 19th in four December
races.</TE>
<TE>   He is traditionally a slow starter, though, and has popped a few
good races of late, finishing 13th in a downhill in Italy and ninth
at the famed Lauberhorn downhill at Wengen, Switzerland.</TE>
<TE>   He can't wait until he steps in the start gate for the Olympic
downhill, even if Austria's Maier won't be there.</TE>
<TE>   The funny thing is, he couldn't beat Maier and Eberharter in big
races until he stopped thinking about them.</TE>
<TE>   "I used to do that, and that's when I already lost before I got to
the gate," he says.</TE>
<TE>   Now, the focus is inward.</TE>
<TE>   Win the race first.</TE>
<TE>   Think like an Austrian.</TE>
<TE>   "The only thing I think about is skiing that hill," he says of the
Olympic course. "I haven't thought anything past the finish line.
There's no way to know what's going to happen. No way to even fathom
how it's going to play out, so I'm just excited to get in the start
and ski that hill, top to bottom, and that's where it stops."</TE>

<LD>To be the best, you've got to beat the best, and UCLA has plenty to
prove in that quest.</LD>
<LD>   The Bruins defeated NCAA tournament-quality opponents in
nonconference play, knocking off Kansas, Alabama and Georgetown in
convincing fashion.</LD>
<LD>   The Pacific 10 Conference has been another story.</LD>
<TE>   UCLA (15-6, 7-4) has lost to Oregon, USC, Arizona and Stanford
while beating up on the lower echelon--sweeping four games against
the Washington schools and defeating California, Arizona State and
Oregon State.</TE>
<TE>   To fulfill the expectations of a team that, with four returning
starters, was picked to win the Pac-10 title and believes it can
reach the Final Four, the second time around the conference must
include victories over top opponents.</TE>
<TE>   Although the Pac-10 tournament the second weekend in March reduces
the importance of the regular season, games against other NCAA
tournament-bound teams are viewed closely by the selection committee.
The difference between a No. 2 or 3 seeding and a No. 5 or 6 could be
the outcome of, say, Wednesday's game between UCLA and USC.</TE>
<TE>   For seeding purposes, it's also useful to have a kick down the
stretch--which begins about now.</TE>
<TE>   The regular-season title is still up for grabs. First-place Oregon
(17-5, 9-2) is 4-5 away from home and must travel to Stanford,
California, UCLA and USC. The Trojans (16-5, 8-3) and Arizona (15-6,
8-3) are tied for second, the Bruins are one game behind them and
Stanford (13-6, 6-4) is another half-game back.</TE>
<TE>   "We've got a lot of big games coming up soon," center Dan Gadzuric
said. "We know what we need to do and we know it can be done."</TE>

<LD>Nearly lost in the course of Sam Clancy's  seventh consecutive
double-double of the season Saturday in USC's 73-69 loss at Oregon
was his proficiency at the free-throw line.</LD>
<LD>   Clancy started the game making 58.3% of his free throws,
second-worst on the team. But the power forward made seven of his
eight free throws against the Ducks, finishing with 25 points and 11
rebounds with a steal and four turnovers in 40 minutes.</LD>
<LD>   He has been better in 11 Pacific 10 Conference games, shooting
64.1% from the free-throw line. He began the season a career 61.3%
free-throw shooter.</LD>
<TE>   "I'm just making more now, not doing anything different," Clancy
said. "Once you start to miss a few, then you miss them all. Once you
start to make a few, then you make more. It's all in the mind."</TE>
<TE>   Clancy, though, is the first Trojan with seven consecutive
double-doubles since Ron Riley had nine in a row over the end of the
1970-71 season and at the start of 1971-72 season. Clancy has a
conference-best 13 double-doubles in 21 games this season and 31 in
his career.</TE>
<TE>   "I started to get on a little roll and when I get on a little
roll, I get a little more confident and I think it's a little harder
to stop me once I get my confidence up," Clancy said. "Things are
going well for me, starting to [make more] free throws."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The 23rd-ranked Trojans (16-5 overall, 8-3 in the Pac-10 and tied
with Arizona for second place) are 3-3 in the conference after
jumping out to a 5-0 start. USC also is 1-2 in Pac-10 games decided
by five points or fewer, 3-3 in all such games.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Oregon Coach Ernie Kent says the conference's parity should pay
off handsomely for the league come Selection Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   "There are six of us right now ... anybody can win this conference
championship," Kent said of Oregon, Arizona, USC, UCLA, Stanford and
California.</TE>
<TE>   "All six, I think, are good enough to be in the NCAA tournament.
Hopefully, we'll all be there and not beat ourselves up too much."</TE>

<HD>Agriculture Education Withering</HD>
<DH>Farming: Few schools offer classes despite a national and
state boom fueled by technological advances.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID PIERSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>At Canoga Park High School, things look much like a zoo.</LD>
<LD>   There's a pig so fat that it can't be weighed on the scale, a
chicken that plucks away at another fighting for a prime place to lay
an egg and goats that get their heads stuck under a fence reaching
for greener grass.</LD>
<LD>   But this is controlled chaos. Nurtured nature. Also known as
agricultural education, a field of study that has withered away in
the Los Angeles Unified School District. Today, ag ed, as it's
called, can be found at only a few district schools.</LD>
<TE>   The demise counters the state and national trend that shows a
growing interest at high schools and community colleges in
agriculture, which, experts said, is a result of new technology in
the industry.</TE>
<TE>   In Los Angeles Unified, duck coops, cabbage patches and rose
gardens, which once covered acres at campuses, now occupy slivers of
open space in the shadow of classroom trailers, football fields and
construction sites. The district's few remaining agricultural
properties are held dear by students and teachers, who worry that the
programs are slowly becoming extinct.</TE>
<TE>   "Because of a shortage of space, we cannot be running farms in the
middle of L.A.," said district Supt. Roy Romer, who grew up during
the Great Depression on a farm in eastern Colorado and later received
degrees in agricultural economics and animal husbandry.</TE>
<TE>   Though agreeing that ag ed is a valued subject that instilled a
strong work ethic in him, Romer said there is little the district can
do to halt the decline of the programs.</TE>
<TE>   Teachers fear that if the programs die off, more children will
grow up thinking food comes from supermarkets, not fields and farms.
Students will lose important lessons in how to live healthy lives and
cultivate food in environmentally responsible ways. And perhaps, most
crucially, students will be less prepared to take jobs in the
expanding agribusiness industry, which relies more and more on
technology and research, the teachers said.</TE>
<TE>   "Every other subject exists because of agriculture," said Carrie
Robertson, an agriculture teacher at Canoga Park. "People need to
understand that the strength of any society is its ability to feed
itself."</TE>
<TE>   Technology Helps Boost Growth</TE>
<TE>   Across the country, interest in ag ed is on the rise. Future
Farmers of America, an organization that helps develop agricultural
education curriculum, has reported an 18-year high in membership. The
number of participants not only stayed strong in historically
agricultural areas elsewhere in California and Texas, but also in
such cities as Chicago and San Francisco.</TE>
<TE>   "Things have been steady, because agriculture is a very broad
industry," said Bill Stagg, a Future Farmers spokesman. "The old
perception is that this is just farming. But any career is accessible
through agriculture, from forestry to marketing to horticulture and
research."</TE>
<TE>   David Wehner, dean of the agriculture department at Cal Poly San
Luis Obispo, said the agricultural industry has grown in recent years
with the advent of technology such as bioengineering.</TE>
<TE>   "There are so many tremendous opportunities," he said.</TE>
<TE>   In California, enrollment in Future Farmers has jumped from 36,400
a decade ago to 55,000 today, which also reflects how many students
are enrolled in ag ed programs in the state, said Charles Parker, the
organization's state representative.</TE>
<TE>   Even the number of ag ed teachers in high schools and community
colleges statewide has increased. Membership in the California
Agricultural Teachers Assn., which represents 92% of the state's
active ag ed faculty, has grown from 500 a decade ago to 740 today,
said Jim Aschwanden, the association's executive director.</TE>
<TE>   There are ag ed programs at 326 high schools, about a third of the
total campuses, in the state. The strongest areas for the subject are
Central California and the North Coast, although there are some
active spots in Southern California, Aschwanden said.</TE>
<TE>   In Los Angeles County, ag ed is scarce in urban areas, although
programs abound in the northern region at such places as the Antelope
Valley Union High School District, where five of the nine campuses
have programs.</TE>
<TE>   In Ventura County, agriculture programs continue to hold steady
from Santa Paula to Simi Valley. Several high schools have
agriculture science courses or academies, and more than three-fourths
of the county's schools have gardens used to teach youngsters where
their food comes from.</TE>
<TE>   Orange County is similar, with thriving secondary school programs
like those in the Fullerton Joint Union High School District, where
five of the six campuses have working farms that raise livestock.</TE>
<TE>   Agricultural education has been in a steady decline in Los Angeles
Unified since the 1980s, when the district began to phase out
vocational studies to give students the time to meet the increased
credit requirements for graduation.</TE>
<TE>   Up to that point, about 80 schools in the district offered
agricultural education, with an enrollment of about 10,000 students.</TE>
<TE>   Today only 19 L.A. Unified campuses--11 high schools and eight
middle schools--offer ag ed, with an enrollment of 2,000, the
district said.</TE>
<TE>   In the past, when new schools were built, the district would be
pressured by local industry to leave space open for ag ed programs,
said Art Hanson, who retired in 1992 but had either taught or
supervised agricultural education in the district for 34 years.</TE>
<TE>   With the decline of farming in the San Fernando Valley and other
parts of the school district, that pressure disappeared, he said.</TE>
<TE>   'I Think We're Dinosaurs'</TE>
<TE>   Of the 85 schools the district plans to build in the next six
years, none will offer agricultural education, said Linda Salomon, an
L.A. Unified spokeswoman.</TE>
<TE>   "The future is very dim," said Arnold Vosburgh, an ag ed teacher
at Narbonne High School in Harbor City. "I think we're dinosaurs."</TE>
<TE>   Today, remaining ag ed teachers in the Los Angeles school district
are mainly veterans. Hanson said programs were shut down when
retiring agriculture teachers were not replaced. Aside from being too
costly, ag ed became unfashionable among students, occupied too much
space and took away from promoting higher math and literacy scores,
many educators said.</TE>
<TE>   Only a few campuses--including Canoga Park, Gardena and North
Hollywood high schools--house animals and grow plants. The 19 Los
Angeles Unified programs receive district funding as well as federal
support, and sometimes raise extra money by selling produce and meat
from the farms.</TE>
<TE>   "If you look at the numbers, [the district] is not supporting ag
ed," Robertson said. "It's not that they don't care; it's that they
can't take care of basic academic needs, let alone something extra
like us."</TE>
<TE>   The students who take agriculture classes display genuine
enthusiasm for the subject, often spending time on the campus farms
after school.</TE>
<TE>   Joe Saurer, 16, of Canoga Park finds himself on the school's
11/2-acre farm almost every afternoon after class, although he is not
enrolled in any ag ed class this semester. The junior said he
initially wanted to become a veterinarian, but enjoyed Canoga Park's
program so much that he is thinking of becoming an ag ed teacher.</TE>
<TE>   Standing amid a dozen classmates recently, Saurer helped coach a
team preparing for an animal breeds identification competition held
at the school.</TE>
<TE>   "That's a Balinese, not a Bombay," he said to a student who
incorrectly named a picture of a cat.</TE>
<TE>   The students chuckled and quizzed each other with all the
excitement one would expect to find in the most popular after-school
club. Except instead of cheerleading or playing musical instruments,
these kids raise swine and plant heirloom tomatoes.</TE>
<TE>   One way teachers hope to ensure a future for ag ed in the district
is to offer classes that carry more credits toward graduation.</TE>

<HD>Study Says  Thrill Ride Injuries on the Rise</HD>
<DH>Medicine: Research by two doctors finds surge nationwide.
They warn particularly of risks to the brain.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KIMI YOSHINO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Riders of roller coasters face a small but real risk of brain injury,
according to a recent article in a medical journal that warns
emergency room physicians to be on the lookout for injured patients
who might have recently visited an amusement park.</LD>
<LD>   The article appears in the Annals of Emergency Medicine, the
journal of the American College of Emergency Physicians.</LD>
<LD>   There have been several cases of brain injury allegedly associated
with roller coasters in Southern California.</LD>
<TE>   Minnesota emergency room doctors Robert J. Braksiek and David J.
Roberts wrote that they had found in the medical literature 16 cases
of head and neck injury suffered during roller coaster rides.</TE>
<TE>   Breaking down the figures revealed a disturbing trend, Braksiek
said, with one case in 1979, none in the 1980s, 14 in the 1990s and
one through August 2000.</TE>
<TE>   "Look what happened in the 1990s," Braksiek, who works at the
Hennepin County Medical Center in Minneapolis, said in an interview.
"What's going to happen in the 2000s?"</TE>
<TE>   The authors wrote that although the risk is low, reported injury
rates at amusement parks increased 95% from 1996 to 1999 even though
attendance increased only 6.5%, according to data from the Consumer
Product Safety Commission.</TE>
<TE>   The cases cited in the article range from people who have made
full recoveries after bleeding in the brain to a 77-year-old man who
suffered nausea, vomiting and headaches after a ride, and died 13
days later.</TE>
<TE>   Researchers compared roller coaster brain injuries, such as
bleeding, with those suffered in a high-speed car crash or from
shaken-baby syndrome.</TE>
<TE>   The roller coaster injuries are caused by the sudden stops and
starts and changes in direction, Braksiek said.</TE>
<TE>   The International Assn. of Amusement Parks and Attractions issued
a written statement in response to the article, which it said
presents no new information or analysis.</TE>
<TE>   "IAAPA would encourage physicians to ask any questions they may
consider necessary to determine the condition and treatment of any
patient," the statement reads.</TE>
<TE>   The trade group also said that although news coverage of injuries
has increased, amusement parks continue to be one of the safest forms
of recreation.</TE>
<TE>   Still, some safety advocates, including Rep. Edward J. Markey
(D-Mass.), have suggested that amusement parks limit roller coasters'
G-forces, the gravitational effects of acceleration on the body. In
recent years, amusement parks have been opening faster, steeper and
sometimes more jolting rides.</TE>
<TE>   The precise effects of G-forces--and how much is too much--remain
unknown when it comes to roller coasters because there have been no
published studies.</TE>
<TE>   "We need to do G-force studies on roller coasters, attach
equipment to the head and neck and monitor what the forces are,"
Braksiek said in the interview. "Any time we're putting our children
on machines that go 100 mph, there has to be some type of regulation,
and studies that prove they're safe.... At some point, we're going to
pass the human threshold of safety."</TE>
<TE>   Barry Novack, a Beverly Hills attorney who settled two cases with
Disneyland stemming from brain hemorrhages allegedly suffered on the
Indiana Jones Adventure ride, said the doctors' article confirms his
contention that there is a risk.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it will bring to light the silent majority out there who
have suffered injury that we don't know about," Novack said.</TE>
<TE>   Novack is also the attorney handling the cases of two Southern
California deaths connected to roller coasters last year. Justine
Dedele Bolia, 20, died Sept. 1 after suffering a brain aneurysm and
collapsing shortly after riding Montezooma's Revenge, a roller
coaster at Knott's Berry Farm in Buena Park. And in June, Pearl
Santos, 28, of Fontana suffered a ruptured aneurysm on the Goliath
roller coaster at Six Flags Magic Mountain in Valencia. The stress
and strain of the ride may have contributed to her death, a coroner's
report stated.</TE>
<TE>   The Brain Injury Assn. of America said this week that it is
assembling a panel of doctors to review medical literature on the
topic. It hopes to make recommendations in the spring.</TE>
<TE>   The review is being done at the urging of Rep. Markey. David
Moulton, Markey's chief of staff, pointed to the vulnerability of
children to such physical forces.</TE>
<TE>   "Unfortunately," Moulton said, "we are going into yet another
riding season without any notion of how much force is too much force
to apply to the bodies of child riders on these supersonic coasters."</TE>

politics, it's denigrated as a weakness.</LD>
<LD>   The weakest candidate now running for governor is Secretary of
State Bill Jones, regardless of his strong 20-year record at the
Capitol.</LD>
<TE>   Jones is a paradox. He cannot beg, bellyache or break arms for
campaign bucks. He has too much integrity and pride. That makes him
weak.</TE>
<TE>   He's a big ol' farm boy, not a glib pitchman. He hasn't learned
the body language and verbal subtleties needed to convey the message
that a generous investment in his venture will return dividends when
he's elected.</TE>
<TE>   Dividends like this: On Friday, Gov. Gray Davis appointed
billionaire TV executive Haim Saban to a coveted seat on the UC Board
of Regents. Since 1999, Saban has sunk more than $400,000 into Davis'
political account.</TE>
<TE>   The key to soliciting is cocky certitude. It's not if you're
elected, it's when.</TE>
<TE>   Donors don't give big money to projected losers. Jones looks like
a loser because he can't raise big money.</TE>
<TE>   Jones, 52, has other fund-raising flaws besides personal
qualities.</TE>
<TE>   He's from the wrong part of the state, the agriculture middle--
Fresno--where some farmers are land-rich, but can't write colossal
checks like the billionaires of Beverly Hills or Silicon Valley.</TE>
<TE>   Example: Last week, Jones received a $25,000 check from the
California Farm Bureau Federation. Two days later, Republican
front-runner Richard Riordan got $250,000 from A. Jerrold Perenchio,
owner of Spanish-language Univision--on top of $250,000 the former
L.A. mayor previously had received from Perenchio.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Another flaw is that Jones isn't superrich. Not only is he
incapable of paying for his own campaign, he doesn't hang with the
superrich. By contrast, Jones' two GOP rivals--Riordan and
businessman Bill Simon Jr.--are loaded.</TE>
<TE>   Both can bankroll themselves. And "they travel in circles with
multimillionaires so it's easier for them to get their friends to
contribute," notes former Gov. George Deukmejian, Jones' campaign
chairman.</TE>
<TE>   If a gubernatorial candidate doesn't have megabucks himself, at
least his friends must.</TE>
<TE>   Jones also has a special flaw. He got on the president's list.</TE>
<TE>   Jones crossed George Bush just before the 2000 California primary
by reneging on an endorsement and siding with Arizona Sen. John
McCain. The secretary of state said he left Bush because the
Republican establishment candidate was trying to discourage Democrats
and independents from voting in open primaries. Courageous, but
calamitous.</TE>
<TE>   After Bush was elected, the word went out: The traitor must pay.
Cut off his money. Get behind Riordan.</TE>
<TE>   "Bush hurt him, no question," says strategist Ed Rollins, a
longtime Jones friend and advisor.</TE>
<TE>   Jones always could eke out enough money to run for secretary of
state or the Assembly. But competing for governor requires many
millions for television. Now he's the only gubernatorial candidate
who hasn't been able to afford TV ads.</TE>
<TE>   He brushes it aside. "You can always raise money," he says. "But
you can't raise a record. It'll take a record to beat Gray Davis."</TE>
<TE>   Right now Jones isn't beating anybody, according to the latest
Times Poll. He's running a distant third in the GOP primary.</TE>
<TE>   For such a lame fund-raiser, Jones got started awfully late.
Instead of beginning to build a war chest immediately after his 1998
reelection, he waited more than two years. If Jones had looked
strong, Simon would not have run.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   "I see a lot of myself in him," Deukmejian says. "It was always
very hard for me [to solicit money].... "There's a natural tendency
that you don't want to feel obligated to an individual. And if you do
make a direct request, you do feel that you're then obligated."</TE>
<TE>   Deukmejian says he never personally asked people for money. Rich
friends asked for him. And he had strong financial backing in the
Armenian community.</TE>
<TE>   Democrat Davis is the supreme solicitor, with $33.1 million banked
at last count. The secret, says chief strategist Garry South: "You
have to be unashamedly dogged and persistent and able to put up with
a lot of humiliation and rejection."</TE>
<TE>   The rejections dwindle once you're governor.</TE>
<TE>   Jones has $1.1 million--not enough for one week's worth of
statewide TV.</TE>
<TE>   He is an excellent example of why we need public financing of
state campaigns. But he's too much of a hidebound Republican to
acknowledge that fact.</TE>
<TE>   He's a paradox. And a political pauper. On March 5, Jones is
almost certain also to be a loser. One with strong character, a solid
record and a starved cashbox.</TE>

<HD>Black Activists Rally Backers of Chief Parks</HD>
<DH>Police: His allies have been low-key, while the union has
been outspoken against a second five-year term for the head of the
LAPD. That's changing.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MATEA GOLD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As Police Chief Bernard C. Parks seeks a second term, African
American activists, religious leaders and political officials are
mobilizing various campaigns to secure his reappointment and
discredit the police union that is leading the campaign against him.</LD>
<LD>   Until recently, allies of the African American chief had limited
their efforts to defending him against criticism by the Police
Protective League, which has denounced him as a rigid and overly
punitive manager and which has accused him of subverting community
policing.</LD>
<LD>   That is changing. Several top black leaders have begun lobbying
Mayor James K. Hahn to keep the chief, while others are planning
rallies and petition campaigns. A recent meeting of the Police
Commission drew hundreds of Parks supporters.</LD>
<TE>   Parks is the second African American to head the LAPD; the first,
Willie L. Williams, was denied a second term in 1997 and was replaced
by Parks.</TE>
<TE>   "It's generally understood among black leaders," said Najee Ali,
executive director of Project Islamic HOPE. "You can't be in the
middle on this one."</TE>
<TE>   Parks encouraged those efforts during a party in Hollywood on
Thursday night celebrating his 37th anniversary with the Los Angeles
Police Department.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it's important that the silent majority in this city
begin to take an active role in expressing their views," the chief
told more than 100 friends, family members and others at the Sunset
Room, where he announced his decision to seek a second term.</TE>
<TE>   "We need people to be vocal and express their views when they see
something going on that is not appropriate," he added. "We need that
assistance, because often when we defend ourselves, it's
self-serving. But when you defend us, it sends a powerful message. "</TE>
<TE>   Two nights earlier, more than 300 people packed the Ward A.M.E.
Church in South Los Angeles during a three-hour meeting of the Police
Commission. About 60 people marched up to the microphone to commend
the chief and deride the police union as others in the audience
chanted, "Five more years!"</TE>
<TE>   Outside, supporters marched with signs reading: "Finally a chief
for the whole community" and "Down on the ground for no reason. Never
again!"</TE>
<TE>   "Why am I supporting Chief Bernard Parks today?" asked Joe Turner,
67. "Four years ago, we stopped having to get out of our cars and lay
down on the streets in the rain in a suit."</TE>
<TE>   The lobbying for the chief has extended beyond the circle of city
insiders and political officials. Steve Harvey, a radio deejay on the
popular station known as "The Beat," is urging people to support
Parks, while South Los Angeles residents say they regularly discuss
the matter with their neighbors as they shop.</TE>
<TE>   "People talk about it at Kmart, wherever you go," said Cashimire
Smith, a teacher from Athens who attended the commission meeting.
"This is the conversation going, period."</TE>
<TE>   One of the goals of the various campaigns on Parks' behalf is to
take on the Police Protective League, which has vowed to fight the
chief's reappointment, saying his stern leadership has caused morale
to plummet. The union that represents rank-and-file officers is
trying to raise $1 million to fight his reappointment and expects to
wage an ad campaign to turn public opinion against a second term.</TE>
<TE>   Some, however, see the league's efforts as counterproductive, and
say they have helped crystallize support for Parks.</TE>
<TE>   "What we have taken full exception to is the manner with which the
Police Protective League has shown utter disregard for the chief, for
the fairness of the process," City Councilman Mark Ridley-Thomas
said. "Their hostility is over the top."</TE>
<TE>   League Too Judgmental of Black Executives?</TE>
<TE>   The racial makeup of the league's board--it has never included an
African American--has deepened skepticism about its motives. As was
the case when the league emerged as a critic of then-Chief Williams,
some defenders of the chief say the league is too judgmental of black
executives.</TE>
<TE>   Parks, in fact, years ago helped found the LAPD's Oscar Joel
Bryant Assn., an organization of black officers. Mitzi Grasso,
president of the union, denied that race has colored the league's
position, saying the league has had Latino directors in the past.</TE>
<TE>   "I would ask the people who insist on making it racial to stop and
grow up," she said. "It's not about race; it's about leadership."</TE>
<TE>   Last week, almost a dozen black leaders sent a letter to Grasso
asking for a community meeting to discuss whether the campaign
against Parks is compromising public safety.</TE>
<TE>   Grasso said Sunday that she had not received the letter, but said
that union leaders would be happy to attend the meeting. She added
that the league does not plan to let up its criticism of Parks.</TE>
<TE>   "What we've done is focus on the issues that affect public
safety," she said. "We're focusing on the fact that morale is very
low, that there is no community-based policing, and yet these groups
keep coming out and personalizing issues."</TE>
<TE>   'Litmus Test Issue' for Mayor Hahn</TE>
<TE>   The other thrust of the various campaigns for Parks is to put the
spotlight on Hahn, who grew up in South Los Angeles and won office in
July with strong backing from African Americans.</TE>
<TE>   "Obviously, given the fact that Mayor Hahn receives overwhelming
support from the African American community, we feel it's important
that he not forget that," said John Mack, president of the Urban
League. "Many in our community see this as a litmus test issue."</TE>
<TE>   Others helping to push for Parks' reappointment include Norman
Johnson, executive director of the Southern Christian Leadership
Conference; the Rev. Cecil Murray of the First A.M.E. Church; Rep.
Maxine Waters (D-Los Angeles) and basketball star Magic Johnson.</TE>
<TE>   At the chief's party Thursday night, other supporters urged Hahn
to come out for Parks.</TE>
<TE>   "I say to the mayor, stand up," said Rep. Diane Watson (D-Los
Angeles). "The PPL cannot take the place of the mayor in this city."</TE>
<TE>   Hahn has repeatedly said that political pressure will not
influence his opinion about the chief.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think political pressure or rallies or anything else are
helpful in making this decision," the mayor said Friday. "And I would
hope that everybody on all sides of the issue would lower the volume
and allow the Police Commission to do its job."</TE>
<TE>   If Parks Rejected, Mayor Picks Chief Off Panel List</TE>
<TE>   The commission says it expects to make a decision on Parks'
reappointment within two months. If it does not give the chief a
second five-year term--which, by charter, would be his last--it would
submit suggested replacements to Hahn, who would then name a new
chief, subject to City Council confirmation. Any decision by the
commission on Parks' fate also could be vetoed by the City Council.</TE>
<TE>   The more overt phase of support for the chief is a delicate
balancing act, some black leaders admit. They are trying to showcase
Parks' support in the African American community without casting his
reappointment as a racial issue or threatening racial tension if he
is denied a second term.</TE>
<TE>   "We're trying to be sensitive to that and advocate on behalf of
Chief Parks without backing anybody into a corner or inadvertently
raising the temperature," Mack said. "We don't want to overdo it."</TE>
<TE>   In fact, he and others are quick to note that Parks has supporters
of many ethnicities. In December, a group of business leaders met to
consider ways to lobby for his renewal.</TE>
<TE>   And many African American activists say they support Parks because
of his leadership, not the color of his skin.</TE>
<TE>   ''We're not coming together for Chief Parks because he's black,''
said Perry Crouch, a gang intervention expert with the Central
Recovery Development Project. ''We're coming together for Chief Parks
because he's right. He weeded out those Yankee Doodle Dandies in the
department, that cowboy mentality.''</TE>
<TE>   Parks Remains Powerful Symbol of Racial Pride</TE>
<TE>   Despite deliberate efforts to downplay Parks' ethnicity in the
selection process, the chief remains for some a powerful symbol of
racial pride. He grew up in the LAPD during the department's years of
segregation, and he was long one of its most successful black
officers. He was beaten out by Williams for the top job in 1992 and
later demoted from the No. 2 job in the department, only to persevere
and capture the top position five years ago.</TE>
<TE>   His selection in 1997 helped mollify some department critics who
questioned then-Mayor Richard Riordan's decision to deny Williams a
second term. Now, some of those same people are watching what will
happen to Parks.</TE>
<TE>   ''Chief Parks is our contract,'' one woman proclaimed vehemently
to the commission last week. ''Anything that is done to move him, we
consider it a breach of contract.''</TE>

<HD>Peaceful Rivalry Plays Out at USC</HD>
<DH>Athletics: Despite tensions between their homelands,
Pakistani, Indian students enjoy weekly cricket match.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>K. CONNIE KANG</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Their nuclear-armed nations appear to be on the brink of going to
war, but you won't catch a hint of that when Indian and Pakistani
students at USC square off against each other on Friday nights.</LD>
<LD>   The Trojan Cricket Club, organized in 1992 by South Asian
students, now has about five dozen members, mostly Indian and
Pakistani graduate students and a handful from England and Sri Lanka.
From 6 to 8 p.m., everyone can join in the weekly game. But from 8 to
10, it's a serious match between teams of Indians and Pakistanis.</LD>
<LD>   "You won't find this kind of thing happening either in India or
Pakistan without riots breaking out," Iftikhar Burhanuddin, a
doctoral candidate in computer science from Madras, India, said only
half-jokingly as he watched his friends play at Cromwell Athletic
Field on a chilly night. "In spite of what's happening in the outside
world, these kids seem to be playing as if nothing has happened."</LD>
<TE>   The players say cricket--a sport as popular on the Indian
subcontinent as baseball and football are in the continental United
States--symbolizes friendly relations between students on campus from
both countries.</TE>
<TE>   "We play together, and we study together," said Salman Khan, a
Pakistani graduate student in computer engineering who is president
of the club this year.</TE>
<TE>   "We talk the same language and eat the same kinds of food," said
Jigar Shah, an electrical engineer from India, who was club president
last year.</TE>
<TE>   Pakistanis and Indians, who belonged to one British-ruled India
before it was partitioned after the 1947 independence, have a lot in
common. Physically, it's impossible to tell them apart. They also
understand each other's languages, because Hindi and Urdu--the most
prevalent native tongues on the subcontinent--are similar. In
addition, the two peoples have in common not only the legacy of
British colonialism, but similar customs, such as in wedding rites;
familiarity with each others' culture and religions; and a keen sense
of humor.</TE>
<TE>   These commonalities, plus being away from home and their shared
passion for the sport, offer sufficient bonding to transcend politics
in their native countries, they say.</TE>
<TE>   The historical enmity between the South Asian neighbors over the
disputed Himalayan region of Kashmir--the source of wars between
India and Pakistan since their independence--appears to have hardly
any bearing on the friendships the international students have forged
in Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Since a December suicide attack on India's parliament, which the
New Delhi government has blamed on Pakistan-based militants, both
countries have mobilized hundreds of thousands of troops along the
border. Numerous militant groups are fighting India's rule in Jammu
and Kashmir, India's only Muslim-majority state, where tens of
thousands have been killed in 12 years of rebellion.</TE>
<TE>   "Bahut Sahi!" ("Really nice!" in Hindi), Indian students yelled on
this Friday night whenever their team scored a run on the well-lit
field.</TE>
<TE>   "Bahut Aala!" ("Very nice!" in Urdu), Pakistanis cheered when
their team moved ahead.</TE>
<TE>   The Indian cricket team has more students to pick from--there are
839 Indians registered at USC, the largest international student
group on campus, compared with 72 Pakistanis. But on this night, the
11-member Pakistani team had the final word: "Shabash! Shabash!"
("Well done!" in Urdu). It won, 181 runs to 126.</TE>
<TE>   Nauman Moazzam, an electric engineer from Lahore, Pakistan, who
has been playing with the club since 1999, said he was looking
forward to a special treat to celebrate.</TE>
<TE>   When the Pakistani team wins, Dr. Saida Aamir Malik, the wife of a
player, treats the winners to a Pakistani meal in their home, Moazzam
said. One of the team's favorites is her spicy chicken karahi, which
she serves with thin bread and sweets.</TE>
<TE>   Osman Javed, known as O.J., says there is no game like cricket for
his people, even though field hockey is Pakistan's national sport.</TE>
<TE>   "Everybody plays [cricket]--in the streets, on the roof, every
place you find some space, people play it," said the electrical
engineer from Rawalpindi, near Islamabad. "It's in our blood. We
can't explain it. We can sit in our homes for five days watching it
on television. We simply love it. It's our way of life."</TE>
<TE>   Not to be outdone, India's Shah, said: "Cricket is everything for
an Indian. It's more than a game. It's lifeblood for an Indian. When
there is a cricket match, the whole country stops."</TE>
<TE>   To play on USC's Cromwell Field, where joggers use the running
track that circles the grass, players have made minor adjustments.
They use a soft ball instead of a hard leather ball. The modification
averts potential injury and saves extra expenses in pads and other
gear, which they can ill afford.</TE>
<TE>   "Sports is just a global feeling," said an Indian cricket player,
Ram Koundinya, an electrical engineering student. "Everyone playing
is the same. It doesn't matter whether you're a Hindu, Christian or a
Muslim."</TE>

<HD>Killer Pit Bulls Are Allowed Home, but With Restrictions</HD>
<DH>Safety: Insurance, enclosure are among the measures to help
prevent a repeat of deadly attack on neighbors' dogs.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STANLEY ALLISON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Two pit bulls that killed a neighbor's two dogs have been returned to
their owner in Huntington Beach after he complied with a judge's
restrictions to protect the public and neighbors.</LD>
<LD>   Jeffrey Harris was able to bring Ryno and Patches back to their
Carp Circle home Jan. 24 after he bought a $500,000 insurance policy,
built an enclosed chain-link dog run in the rear yard, reinforced a
wood fence and installed a steel security screen door.</LD>
<LD>   Those measures and several others, however, are not enough to
erase neighbor Denise Cassaro's fears. Those were her dogs that were
killed.</LD>
<TE>   "I'm scared of him [Harris] getting lazy in seven or eight months
and forgetting about the law," Cassaro said.</TE>
<TE>   Harris declined to comment.</TE>
<TE>   The pit bulls broke through a weak spot in the backyard fence in
June and chased Cassaro's Labrador retriever and Shih Tzu through an
open back door into the house and killed them. The family was away
when the attack occurred.</TE>
<TE>   The pit bulls were removed by county animal control officers and
were penned while their fate was decided in court.</TE>
<TE>   Cassaro and animal control officials had argued that the attack
was so brutal that the pit bulls should be put to death.</TE>
<TE>   Harris sued in November to prevent animal control from carrying
out its decision. Orange County Superior Court Judge Nho Trong Nguyen
spared the dogs' lives because they had attacked other dogs and not
humans and because this was their first violent incident.</TE>
<TE>   Cassaro said the pain of losing her two friends, Jake and Gizmo,
was compounded when the judge allowed the pit bulls to return.</TE>
<TE>   "I guess the first kill is free," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Nguyen also ordered that when the pit bulls are not inside Harris'
house or the dog run, they must wear a muzzle and be restrained by a
leash no longer than 6 feet and held by an adult.</TE>
<TE>   "Beware of Dog" signs had to be placed at all of the home's
entrances, and Harris is not allowed to have more than three dogs on
the property.</TE>
<TE>   Animal Control spokesman Howard Sutter said, "We will be doing
unannounced patrol checks, which we have done since they were
returned, and that will continue," to make sure the judge's
requirements are followed.</TE>
<TE>   Harris must also have the dogs sterilized within 30 days of their
return.</TE>
<TE>   "That's because they are typically less aggressive if they are
spayed and neutered," Sutter said.</TE>
<TE>   Cassaro, her husband, Joe, and their two young sons, Travis and
Danny, have brought another Labrador, named Murphy, into their home.</TE>
<TE>   Cassaro, however, is haunted by what happened to Jake and Gizmo.</TE>
<TE>   "What if my kids had been in the house?" she asked, shaking at the
thought of what might have happened.</TE>
<TE>   She said she had pointed out to Harris the holes the pit bulls
made in the fence separating the properties several times, and he
would cover them.</TE>
<TE>   "He was responsive to me, but he would never do anything on his
own," Cassaro said.</TE>

<DH>Philanthropy: Oxnard rescue mission doesn't just feed the
destitute and addicted. It teaches them to be chefs and helps them
get hired.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JENIFER RAGLAND</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The lunch hour is fast approaching and culinary student Ruben
Rodriguez swiftly stirs a spicy Sicilian sauce.</LD>
<LD>   His teacher sips a spoonful: Needs more pepper. Rodriguez grabs an
oversized can of the spice, delivers two blasts and stirs, stirs,
stirs. There isn't much time.</LD>
<LD>   Soon more than 100 people--poor, homeless and hungry for a hot
meal--will line up outside the Ventura County Rescue Mission in
Oxnard for heaping plates of the food Rodriguez is preparing.</LD>
<TE>   It's a line Rodriguez stood in less than four months ago, after 15
years of being strung out on heroin or locked in jail. He checked
himself into the shelter's recovery program last fall and enrolled in
this culinary school, which is teaching him the basics of cooking and
catering.</TE>
<TE>   "I love cooking, but I never thought I could make it a
profession," said Rodriguez, 39. "I am learning to stand on my own
feet as a man."</TE>
<TE>   Dozens of men--once homeless, jobless and hopeless--have graduated
from the school since it began in 1998. Many are now employed by
catering companies, or in oil-rig galleys, hotels or restaurants.</TE>
<TE>   The school is part of a nationwide trend to pair soup kitchens
with programs that equip meal recipients with culinary skills. The
idea is to provide food for the hungry and, at the same time,
sustenance for broken lives.</TE>
<TE>   One of the first programs was DC Central Kitchen in Washington,
D.C., which director Robert Egger started in 1989. Since then, at
least 65 similar programs have cropped up in 58 cities--from New York
to Portland, Ore. They exist in Burbank, San Francisco and
Sacramento.</TE>
<TE>   "It works because people feel like they're part of a team. We
bring them in and tell them, 'If you help us feed the city, we'll get
you a good job,'" Egger said. "What separates these kitchens from
other job training programs around the country is that they have made
the big mission a training opportunity."</TE>
<TE>   Tomas Cassia, founder and director of the Oxnard program, saw that
opportunity when he arrived at the mission to interview for a job
running the kitchen.</TE>
<TE>   "When I first came here, they were serving soup and sandwiches,"
he said. "I thought, 'We can do something better for them.' "</TE>
<TE>   On a recent weekday, the soup kitchen's main course for lunch is
fillet of fish topped with Rodriguez's Sicilian sauce--a crimson
concoction of tomatoes, peppers, onions and garlic. On the side are
salad, a hearty rice-and-pasta dish and a pile of steamed mixed
vegetables. Dessert is freshly baked chocolate-chip cookies.</TE>
<TE>   For dinner, the entree is Cajun jambalaya.</TE>
<TE>   "Every day we serve quality food," said Cassia. "Many times we
have better food here than at my house," he added with a smile.</TE>
<TE>   Cassia compiles the menus each morning, depending on what has been
donated to the mission that week by families, churches and local
businesses.</TE>
<TE>   All the recipes are Cassia's own, and everything in the mission
kitchen is made from scratch. A 12-man crew--some of them in the
kitchen at 6 a.m.--spends hours peeling, chopping, boiling and
baking.</TE>
<TE>   "I joke that I am the only chef who serves 1,000 meals a day and
receives no complaints," Cassia said.</TE>
<TE>   At noon, when people file into the cafeteria, Cassia's students
take their places. Wearing white chef hats and blue aprons, they load
up tray after tray until everyone is fed.</TE>
<TE>   When lunch service ends, the culinary school day is far from over.
After washing dishes and scouring the stainless-steel equipment, the
students head to class.</TE>
<TE>   Throughout the six-month program, Cassia and the mission's
executive chef, Mike Lodi, teach courses on everything from setting
tables for a banquet to preparing pastry dough.</TE>
<TE>   Today, it's a class on food safety, such as proper handling of raw
meat. At the end of the weeklong lesson, the students will take a
test furnished by the National Restaurant Assn. that will give
successful students a certification card good for three years, Lodi
said. Many restaurants require that employees be certified in food
safety.</TE>
<TE>   The school is also affiliated with the Channel Islands Chefs
Assn., a chapter of the American Culinary Federation--the nation's
oldest and largest organization of chefs and cooks.</TE>
<TE>   Chapter President Eric Olson, executive chef at the Ojai Valley
Inn, has hired several of Cassia's students to work during busy
holiday periods, when many restaurants and catering companies need
extra hands.</TE>
<TE>   "The men I've worked with have been great," he said. "And I know
the guys who are in charge are doing a heck of a job."</TE>
<TE>   Aside from feeding 1,000 people daily at the mission and in local
parks, the crew puts on banquets and caters special events on
occasion.</TE>
<TE>   Last week, the school hosted the chefs association's monthly
dinner.</TE>
<TE>   Cassia did not want to interfere with the daily dinner service at
the soup kitchen, so he partnered with Valley Spuds, an Oxnard-based
potato and vegetable supplier. He and his crew transformed the
company's chilly processing warehouse into a dining room and served a
seven-course gourmet meal to about 30 of the county's top chefs and
restaurateurs.</TE>
<TE>   To fit the setting, each dish highlighted the potato--from salmon
potato puffs to grilled fillet mignon in a bed of fried potatoes, to
potato crepes with fruit and ice cream.</TE>
<TE>   Valley Spuds donated much of the food, and because of the
mission's limited resources, Cassia covered the rest from his pocket.</TE>
<TE>   "These people have done so much for us," he said. "I didn't want
to present them with a lousy dinner."</TE>
<TE>   The food got rave reviews.</TE>
<TE>   "The work Tomas has these guys doing is absolutely incredible,"
said Harry Brockwell, a retired chef who is active in several
industry associations. "Fellas who six months ago had no direction
are doing fine culinary work that is hard to find in many kitchens
today."</TE>
<TE>   Cassia dreams of expanding his program, and has applied for a
$200,000 grant from the state's Economic Development Department to
pay for better equipment and vehicles to transport cooks to and from
jobs.</TE>
<TE>   For now, he said, lack of money and staff prevents him from
teaching much more than the basics.</TE>
<TE>   "But to me," he said, "it is more than enough to have a new
start."</TE>
<TE>   It was certainly enough for 47-year-old Armando Rivera. The Oxnard
man graduated from the culinary program a year and a half ago, and
now works for three companies, including Buenaventura Catering Co.,
one of the county's largest caterers.</TE>
<TE>   Just two years ago, Rivera was scouring the streets for his next
drug fix. When he first arrived at the mission, his jaw was wired
shut from a fight the night before.</TE>
<TE>   Now, on his days off, he returns to volunteer in the rescue
mission's kitchen. He likes being an example for men still in the
program, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "I had no future," Rivera said. "This place is a miracle for me."</TE>
<TE>   Each student in Cassia's school also takes part in the mission's
12-month drug and alcohol recovery program, which is grounded in
spirituality. Candidates must be in that program for 30 days before
Cassia will allow them into the culinary school.</TE>
<TE>   "We invest a lot of money in them, so we can't take someone who
just came for a place to stay and is waiting for better weather," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   The school has turned out several success stories, but the process
is not always easy. Most graduates end up with jobs in the food
service industry, but sometimes a graduate will revert to his old
habits. Others stay clean but struggle to make overdue child-support
payments, obtain driver's licenses or find affordable housing.</TE>
<TE>   Lately, Cassia has worked closely with Universal Sodexho, a
company that provides support services to the oil rigs off the
Ventura County coast. Several recent graduates have been hired by the
company's catering operation to cook for employees on the rigs.</TE>
<TE>   Those jobs provide the men with shelter, food and clothing while
they make between $8 and $12 an hour, giving them time to save money
and get on their feet again, Cassia said.</TE>
<TE>   Lee Thurmond, 39, worked as the executive steward--equivalent to
an executive chef--on one of the oil platforms for five months. He
helped feed about 30 people three meals daily--everything from
chorizo and eggs to salmon steaks in sesame oil. Many of the recipes
came from his training at the rescue mission.</TE>
<TE>   Thurmond battled alcoholism for years, and was homeless for a
month before he enrolled in the culinary school. Though he had toiled
in plenty of kitchens over the years, he said he never understood the
business of running one.</TE>
<TE>   "Tomas and Mike taught me all the valuable things I needed to be
successful and to maintain a position here in the industry," said
Thurmond, who now lives part time in Oxnard.</TE>

<HD>Francis Gabreski, 83; Pilot Was War Hero</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MYRNA OLIVER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"I said, 'Oh, my God, somebody can do the same thing to me.' It
scared the hell out of me."</LD>
<LD>   Such was the reaction of the son of Polish immigrants from Oil
City, Pa., America's future ace of aces, on Aug. 24, 1943, when the
24-year-old fighter pilot shot down his first German Messerschmitt.</LD>
<LD>   Nine years later, when he returned to a hero's parades and parties
in San Francisco, Los Angeles and his own hometown after destroying
371/2 enemy aircraft during 266 combat missions in two wars, he
dismissed all the medals and accolades by saying he was "just
fortunate."</LD>
<TE>   Francis Stanley "Gabby" Gabreski, America's top air ace in Europe
during World War II who destroyed 31 enemy planes and then switched
to jets and became an air ace anew in Korea, shooting down 61/2 enemy
aircraft in dogfights at about the speed of sound, has died. He was
83.</TE>
<TE>   Gabreski, who later worked for Grumman Aerospace and failed to
rescue the troubled Long Island Rail Road commuter line, died
Thursday of a heart attack near his home in Dix Hills, N.Y.</TE>
<TE>   Wielding his P-47 Thunderbolt single-engine fighter as an aerial
scythe, Gabreski shot 28 German planes out of the air and destroyed
three more on the ground in the 11 months in 1943-44 before he
crash-landed near Coblentz, Germany, and was taken prisoner of war.</TE>
<TE>   Once he became an ace (a pilot who shoots down five or more enemy
planes), Gabreski quickly built and maintained the American record
for Europe. By war's end, only three American fliers had bested his
tally, and all in the Pacific--Maj. Richard Bong with 40 "kills,"
Maj. Thomas McGuire with 38 and Navy Cmdr. David McCampbell with 34.</TE>
<TE>   Over Korea, when Gabreski was at the controls of an F-86 Sabre
jet, the target became Soviet-built MIG-15 fighters. He took out half
a dozen and shared the destruction of a seventh with another pilot.</TE>
<TE>   In the two wars, Gabreski amassed plenty of military decorations:
the Distinguished Service Cross, Silver Star with Oak Leaf Cluster,
Distinguished Flying Cross with nine Oak Leaf Clusters, Air Medal
with four clusters, the Bronze Star, the French Legion d'Honneur and
Croix de Guerre with Palm, Polish Cross of Valor, British
Distinguished Flying Cross and the Belgian Croix de Guerre.</TE>
<TE>   But the kudos he treasured most came much later--his induction
into the Aviation Hall of Fame in 1978 and the renaming of the
Suffolk County, N.Y., airport for him in 1992. His final Army posting
had been commanding the 52nd Fighter Interceptor Wing in Westhampton
Beach when Francis S. Gabreski Airport was Suffolk County Air Force
Base.</TE>
<TE>   Born Jan. 28, 1919, to Stanley and Josephine Gabryszewski 10 years
after they emigrated from Poland to Pennsylvania, young "Frank" (who
shortened his surname) began a premed course at Notre Dame
University. But he was already hooked on flying, having seen an air
race in Cleveland when he was 13--a race won by his lifelong hero,
Jimmy Doolittle, future commander of the 8th Air Force in World War
II.</TE>
<TE>   Gabreski took flying lessons and dropped out of college after his
sophomore year to join an Army Air Corps cadet program. Graduated as
a second lieutenant in March 1941, he was sent to a fighter unit at
Wheeler Field in Hawaii.</TE>
<TE>   "We never knew what hit us until it hit us," he would say decades
later, describing the morning of Dec. 7, 1941. He was shaving when
the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor. It took two hours for him to get
into one of the few remaining P-36 fighters still intact and get
airborne, and by then the Japanese were gone.</TE>
<TE>   Ironically, instead of pursuing the new enemy that had brought the
United States into World War II, the Polish-speaking Gabreski asked
to go to Europe. He initially flew British Spitfires with a Polish
unit of the Royal Air Force, but after more than 20 missions with
them, joined the U.S. 56th Fighter Group stationed in England.</TE>
<TE>   On July 5, 1944, Gabreski downed his 28th German plane, becoming
at that time the top American ace in the war. He was a hero, and
ready to go home on leave to marry his sweetheart and maybe sell war
bonds.</TE>
<TE>   But on July 20, eager to maintain his "kill" record, he
volunteered for one more mission. After accompanying bombers
attacking railroad yards near Frankfurt, Gabreski strafed a German
airfield near Coblentz, doing damage to the enemy but flying so low
he caused his own propeller to strike the ground. He crash-landed in
a wheat field and spent five days on foot before a farmer turned him
in to German authorities.</TE>
<TE>   "We've been expecting you for a long time," his German
interrogator told him, holding a file of press clippings about the
American ace.</TE>
<TE>   Ten days later Gabreski's parents and fiancee learned he was
missing in action, and within a month were told he was a prisoner of
war.</TE>
<TE>   After the Germans surrendered in May 1945, Gabreski was one of
7,700 Americans and 1,500 British POWs liberated from Stalag Luft No.
1 north of Berlin.</TE>
<TE>   Two months later, on June 11, 1945, Lt. Col. Gabreski finally got
to marry Catherine "Kay" Cochran, after postponing the wedding first
because of Pearl Harbor and again when he was taken prisoner. After
48 years of marriage and nine children, she died in a car crash in
1993.</TE>
<TE>   At war's end, Gabreski tried civilian life for a year or so,
working as an executive at Douglas Aircraft's Santa Monica plant. But
he rejoined the military in 1947, flew as a test pilot and earned a
college degree under Army auspices at Columbia University. In 1951,
he went to Korea where he became commander of the 51st
Fighter-Interceptor Wing and was the eighth man to earn an "ace"
designation in a jet.</TE>
<TE>   When he came to Los Angeles for his well-earned hero's welcome in
1952, Gabreski told The Times, "Jet combat isn't much different than
World War II fighting. It's faster, of course, but the rate of
closure is about the same and most of the tricks of attack and
defense are identical. Combat speed? Generally about the speed of
sound."</TE>
<TE>   By then a colonel, Gabreski's first assignment after his 100
missions in Korea was chief of flight safety research at Norton Air
Force Base near San Bernardino. He also served at bases in South
Carolina, Okinawa, Hawaii and Long Island, N.Y., before retiring from
the Air Force in 1967, the pilot who had flown more combat missions
than any other American. He served as president of the American
Fighter Aces Assn. in 1968.</TE>
<TE>   The civilian Gabreski spent the next 20 years as an executive with
Grumman Aerospace in Bethpage, N.Y., except for the years 1978-81
when his popularity and Polish background led him into a political
arena where his luck ran out.</TE>
<TE>   Although Gabreski himself remarked that he "didn't know anything
about Lionel toy trains, let alone a real commuter line," New York
Gov. Hugh L. Carey appointed him president of the Long Island Rail
Road. Carey was facing opposition from a Polish American rival and
criticism from another political foe that he ignored Long Island's
problems.</TE>
<TE>   He hoped that Gabreski's heritage and strong identification with
the area would help him at the polls.</TE>
<TE>   The straightforward Gabreski, who took the railroad job and later
left it as first a cold wave and then a heat wave affected the
commuter railroad's performance, became an advocate for his employees
and commuters. He also offered his own candid assessment that the
operation "stinks."</TE>
<TE>   Gabreski is survived by three sons, Donald of Dayton, Ohio; Robert
of Holmes Beach, Fla., and James of Melbourne, Fla.; six daughters,
Djoni Murphy of Trego, Wis.; Mary Ann Bruno of Dana Point, Calif.;
Frances Phillips of Westhampton Beach, N.Y.; Patricia Covino of
Quogue, N.Y.; Linda Kay Gabreski of Huntington Station, N.Y., and
Debbie Ann Burkhardt of South Huntington, N.Y.; two sisters, Bernice
Stanczak of New Castle, Pa., and Lottie Kocan of Erie, Pa.; 18
grandchildren and four great-grandchildren.</TE>
<TE>   The modest hero told Newsday only a week before his death that as
"a relic from World War II" he considered it a duty to "perpetuate
what this country did during that war."</TE>
<TE>   "I love this country," he said then, "and I'm proud to be an
American. If we hadn't won the war, this world would now be an
entirely different place."</TE>

<DH>Profile: Herb Wesson comes west, parlaying his people
skills into prime political clout as speaker.</DH>

<AU>MIGUEL BUSTILLO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>Herb Wesson came to California at age 22 with no job, no college
degree, no real prospects to speak of, just a dying father's word
that the West held more promise for a young black man than the
automobile plants of Cleveland.</LD>
<LD>   Wesson sold pots and pans, buffed floors, tended bar at parties in
the Hollywood Hills--and even tried his hand at stand-up comedy--as
he searched for an identity in Los Angeles. Eventually, he stumbled
into a career in politics when he tried to volunteer for a
congressional candidate but got lost on the freeway and wound up
enlisting at the headquarters of the man's chief competitor instead.</LD>
<LD>   This week, 28 years after pursuing his California dream, Wesson,
50, will take over as the next speaker of the state Assembly. The job
made famous by such outsize personalities as Willie Brown and Jesse
"Big Daddy" Unruh has diminished in importance since term limits
restricted political careers in the Legislature. But it still carries
tremendous clout.</LD>
<TE>   As speaker, Wesson, a Culver City Democrat, will act as a key
negotiator with Gov. Gray Davis on the state's $100-billion budget.
He will control every committee assignment in the Assembly and help
shape legislation affecting the lives of all 35 million Californians.</TE>
<TE>   That's a lot of power for a guy who has time for a 30-minute
bubble bath every morning.</TE>
<TE>   How Wesson climbed the political ladder to become the 65th
Assembly speaker--the third in a row from the Los Angeles area--is
testament to his extraordinary ability to establish a rapport with
almost anyone, according to friends, former political bosses, fellow
legislators and Wesson himself.</TE>
<TE>   Smooth and smartly dressed, the 5-foot-5, 150-pound Wesson moves
comfortably in circles of power and is considered by his peers to be
the ultimate people person, an important trait in a profession built
on personal relationships.</TE>
<TE>   "All of us are given certain blessings, and this is my blessing: I
work well with people," Wesson said during a recent interview in his
Capitol office.</TE>
<TE>   Wesson's gift for connecting with people was evident from his
earliest days in blue-collar Ohio, where the Wesson home was a magnet
for neighborhood children and "Little Herbie" dispensed sage counsel
to classmates on girls and neighborhood bullies, said his brother,
Steve.</TE>
<TE>   So was a passion for the poor and disenfranchised, said his
mother, Gladys, who believes her son compensated for his lack of
size, and the prejudice he encountered as a youngster because of his
race, by honing his interpersonal skills.</TE>
<TE>   Aiding Those Victimized in Society a Prime Policy</TE>
<TE>   Wesson  said that a desire to help those he feels are being
victimized in society is his primary policy goal as speaker.</TE>
<TE>   To many lobbyists and lawmakers, the political views of Wesson
appear flexible at best and remain an enigma.  He has authored few
bills of consequence since being elected in 1998.</TE>
<TE>   "The interesting thing about Herb is that I don't think he
approaches most issues, with the exception of civil rights, from a
strong ideological perspective," said Assemblyman Darrell Steinberg
(D-Sacramento), the only serious challenger to Wesson's bid for
speaker.</TE>
<TE>   Some see that flexibility as a potential strength. But others in
the Capitol privately wonder whether Wesson has any principled policy
positions or is simply interested in the Machiavellian exercise of
accumulating power--speculation that upsets the usually unflappable
legislator.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't tolerate women being discriminated against," Wesson said.
"Gays, lesbians, blacks, Latinos--my goal is to have every child to
be able to wake up and say to their mother, 'I don't want to be
president.' And I want them to decide that based on the fact they
don't want to do the job.</TE>
<TE>   "Those are the things I am not flexible on. That's what Herb
Wesson is about," he said.</TE>
<TE>   That said, Wesson concedes he sees the speakership differently
from some of his predecessors, and intends to approach what he calls
"a temp job at best" much as he did his past political work as chief
of staff to Los Angeles City Councilman Nate Holden and Los Angeles
County Supervisor Yvonne Brathwaite Burke. Only now, his bosses will
be the 79 other members of the Assembly--or at least the 49 other
Democrats.</TE>
<TE>   Increasingly, other lawmakers say, the speaker's duties come down
to two things: raising money to help party colleagues get elected,
and keeping their considerable egos in check.</TE>
<TE>   "Being a chief of staff, I learned that 75% of your job is being a
fireman," Wesson said. "So if part of the speaker's job is being a
fireman, I believe I am pretty well-equipped to put on that red hat
and shoot foam on people."</TE>
<TE>   A political life seemed far from reach when Wesson was growing up
in Cleveland. Most of the men in  his family went straight to work on
the assembly line after high school, Ford or Chevrolet.</TE>
<TE>   Wesson was expected to do the same. But he wanted to attend
college. His grades were unimpressive, yet he managed to get accepted
to a small black college in Pennsylvania, Lincoln State University.
His parents took on extra work to pay his tuition.</TE>
<TE>   It was there that Wesson met a man who convinced him he could make
more of himself than he had previously thought possible. Ron Dellums,
a fiery African American congressman from Berkeley, was visiting the
campus to give a speech. He belonged to the same fraternity as
Wesson, Alpha Phi Alpha, and he stopped by to chat, fashionably
sporting a large afro and an Eisenhower jacket.</TE>
<TE>   "Five minutes into his speech, I am sitting there like this,"
Wesson said, moving to the edge of his seat. "Every word, I hung on,
and I turned to my fraternity brothers and said, 'That's what I'm
gonna do.' "</TE>
<TE>   However, family troubles forced Wesson to pull out of college in
1973 before he could earn a degree. Herb Wesson Sr., who had a weak
heart, fell ill and had to leave his job. Wesson had to get a job as
a salesman to help provide for the family. His father died a year
later.</TE>
<TE>   Depressed, Wesson was unsure what to do with his life when he
remembered his father's advice about the West. His mother and brother
soon followed him to Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Wesson's attempt to get into politics did not go as planned when
the congressional candidate he mistakenly supported, Nate Holden, was
defeated by the man he meant to work for, Julian Dixon. But Holden
was impressed by Wesson's moxie. When Holden was later elected to the
Los Angeles City Council, he hired Wesson.</TE>
<TE>   "I knew he wanted something in the game," said Holden, who only
half-jokingly assumes credit for Wesson's entire political career.
"You could see he was in it to get ahead, and he knew he would get
ahead through me."</TE>
<TE>   Wesson left Holden's employ a couple of years later to manage the
comeback campaign of Burke, a former congresswoman who won a heated
race to become Los Angeles County's first black supervisor in 1992.
He worked as her top aide until running for the Assembly himself in
1998.</TE>
<TE>   Panel Chairmanship Gives Clues to his Style</TE>
<TE>   Wesson was miles ahead of his term-limited colleagues in the
insiders' game of politics when he arrived in Sacramento, and he was
almost instantly touted as future speaker material.</TE>
<TE>   In what some consider a calculated plan to become speaker, Wesson
sought and received the chairmanship of the euphemistically titled
Governmental Organization Committee, the panel that deals with
alcohol, tobacco and gambling legislation. Wesson was soon rolling in
campaign cash, becoming one of his party's top fund-raisers.</TE>
<TE>   Wesson's deal-making on the committee provides clues as to how he
will act as speaker, and several lawmakers pointed to one deal in
particular as an example of how he balances competing interests.</TE>
<TE>   After The Times reported on the subhuman working conditions of
many workers at California racetracks two years ago, labor unions and
others demanded change. Wesson worked with the horse-racing industry,
one of his major benefactors, and helped fashion a classic piece of
legislative sausage: Workers would be protected, but as part of the
same measure, the horse-racing industry would be allowed to collect
bets over the Internet, something they had sought for years. The bill
became law last year.</TE>
<TE>   "I was very impressed with his ability to make something out of
that," said Assemblyman Alan Lowenthal (D-Long Beach), who sided with
labor on the issue--and was also the first lawmaker to commit to
voting for Wesson as speaker.</TE>
<TE>   Wesson's speakership is being celebrated by many in Los Angeles'
black community, who see it as another sign that though they are few
in numbers, the state's African American politicians can transcend
ethnic politics and move into the mainstream. Naturally, it is also
being celebrated by Wesson's family, much of which plans to make the
trip Wednesday to watch his coronation.</TE>
<TE>   But there is one man they wish could be present who cannot attend.
It is to him, they say, that Wesson's accomplishment would mean most.</TE>
<TE>   "I will be there with a big smile on my face and a tear in my
eye," Steve Wesson said. "The only disappointment is that my dad is
not alive to see it."</TE>

<HD>Ethnic Influence, by the Numbers</HD>
<DH>Politics: O.C.-based Hispanic 100, a heavily GOP executive
group, starts fast on shaping a pro-business agenda.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JENNIFER MENA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It started two months ago, with just seven members: five CEOs, an
attorney and a retired vice president for State Farm.</LD>
<LD>   Eighty-seven members later, the organization, optimistically
billing itself Hispanic 100, demonstrated its first bit of political
pull: It lured all three Republican candidates for governor to an
invitation-only luncheon in Orange County.</LD>
<LD>   The group tilts heavily Republican, with only a few Democratic
members. Its mission: to advance a Latino-friendly, pro-business
agenda, without ignoring such traditional activist rallying points as
immigration and education.</LD>
<TE>   The group hopes to conduct other forums and will soon consider
whether to become a political action committee, which could donate
money to campaigns. Members are looking to the Republicans' Lincoln
Club as a model for their own development.</TE>
<TE>   "This is an effort to create a structure that local, state and
federal candidates can approach," said Carlos Olamendi, a founding
member who runs a Capistrano Beach restaurant and an international
financing company, Cor International. "This is a group of [Latinos],
most of whom have come from rags to riches.... These are people who
not only know what taxes are, they know what payroll is."</TE>
<TE>   The group's formation comes as Democrats and Republicans jockey to
capture a growing Latino vote.</TE>
<TE>   Last month in Ontario, President Bush conducted a town meeting
sponsored by the Latino Coalition Foundation, the Ontario Hispanic
Chamber of Commerce, the Orange County Hispanic Chamber of Commerce
and the Latin Business Assn.</TE>
<TE>   "Latinos are the most important battleground in American politics
today. The Republicans, led by the president, are trying to attract
Latino voters to their party. Democrats are now trying to do
everything they can to hold on to them," said Sergio Bendixen, a
longtime pollster for Latino clients. "What you are seeing in Orange
County has a lot to do with that."</TE>
<TE>   Zeke Hernandez, a Democrat and president of the League of United
Latin American Citizens in Santa Ana, agreed.</TE>
<TE>   "Latinos who are Democrats will see [Hispanic 100] as a ploy to
build [Republican] numbers. It's pressure on the Democrats to do
their own work. They can't sit on their duffs and say, 'We have done
outreach in the past' and say they are satisfied," Hernandez said.</TE>
<TE>   Advantages Also Called Bipartisan</TE>
<TE>   Still, both parties could get a boost from Hispanic 100's efforts,
said Jess Araujo, another Orange County Democrat and founder of Latin
American Voters of America, which registers Latino voters.</TE>
<TE>   "It promotes democracy. It forces the political parties to compete
more aggressively for our interest and our dollars," Araujo said.</TE>
<TE>   Drawing Latinos into the political process is a major challenge.
In California, which is one-third Latino, only 16% of registered
voters are Latino. Of those, 68% are Democrats and 20% are
Republicans. Orange County has even fewer Latino voters--12%--but
more are Republicans, 28% compared with 54% Democrats.</TE>
<TE>   That makes Orange County fertile ground for Hispanic 100.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the 87 members are owners of businesses with annual sales
of more than $1 million, or Latino executives with corporations such
as the Walt Disney Co., Pacific Bell and Gigante USA who are active
in the community.</TE>
<TE>   Sometimes they disagree. Most members, however, believe a healthy
economy, not government aid, will help society. Yet there is also a
general sense that a more liberal immigration policy would benefit
business and unify families. The group has taken no formal position
on that, however.</TE>
<TE>   Hispanic 100's principal founder, Manuel J. Ramirez, who also
heads Orange County's Hispanic Chamber of Commerce, said the group
has already attracted a surprising amount of attention. After last
week's gubernatorial event, which drew former Los Angeles Mayor
Richard Riordan, Secretary of State Bill Jones and L.A. businessman
Bill Simon, the candidates called members of Hispanic 100
individually to hear their concerns about issues such as independent
contracting, worker's compensation reform, taxes and energy costs.</TE>
<TE>   But Ramirez, a 36-year-old father and president of an Irvine
accounting firm, insists that Hispanic 100 will not exist just to
support Republicans. Instead, he says, candidates on the side of
issues important to Latino businesses could gain support regardless
of party. And the issues may be statewide, but could also be local,
he said.</TE>
<TE>   "When you bring 100 top Hispanics into the room, things happen,"
Ramirez said. "Money gets raised. People get elected. Issues get
tackled."</TE>

<HD>Seniors Learning It Takes Hard Work to Find a Job</HD>
<DH>Careers: College graduates must do their homework to ferret
out firms that are hiring, especially in the West.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEPHANIE STASSEL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>With college graduation in sight, Erica Shinohara is looking for a
position with a nonprofit agency that will give her some hands-on
experience. But her plans may have to change as she scrambles to find
a job in the current weak economy.</LD>
<LD>   College career counselors say that, with the nation's unemployment
rate at 5.8%--near a seven-year high--and California's jobless rate
at 6%, few graduating students are able to write their own ticket.</LD>
<LD>   "It's a devastating time, looking at remarkable young people and
knowing what they will go through. Two years ago, a student sent out
three resumes [and landed a job]. Now, they're sending out 25 to 40
resumes," said Kathie Kieran-Johnson, director of the Center for
Career and Academic Advising at Seaver College, Pepperdine
University's undergraduate school. "Some of our top students have
interviewed with 40 companies. Even high-caliber people are having a
hard time."</LD>
<TE>   Although some economists predict the country is beginning to come
out of the recession, graduating seniors nationwide are having a
tough time landing their first jobs.</TE>
<TE>   "We're seeing it all over, but the West is having a little tougher
time due to high-tech and telecommunications businesses," said
Camille Luckenbaugh, employment information manager for the National
Assn. of Colleges and Employers, a nonprofit organization that
provides research and publications to college career-planning
counselors. "The opportunities are out there, but they are much
harder to find."</TE>
<TE>   An association survey of 439 employers nationwide in July showed
they expected to hire about 20% fewer new college graduates this year
than they did in 2001. But in the West, employers expected to hire
44.8% fewer graduates.</TE>
<TE>   Defense contractors and government agencies, which seem to have
more opportunities now, are getting attention from college grads
looking for stability after the dot-com crash, Luckenbaugh said.</TE>
<TE>   New graduates will need to do their homework and may need to be
flexible about where they are willing to live and work, said Brian
Krueger, president of Collegegrad .com, a Web site that helps
students find entry-level jobs.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not the obvious employers that have openings now. Graduates
will have to dig deeper to find companies that are hiring," he said.
"Some students might say, 'I'm in L.A. I've always been in L.A.' But
they might find that the job they really want ... is in the Midwest
or on the East Coast."</TE>
<TE>   To get interviews, many students attend on-campus job fairs where
they can meet face-to-face with potential employers. However,
employers' participation in campus job fairs has dropped in the past
year throughout Southern California, according to organizers.</TE>
<TE>   Last fall's job fair at UCLA had 25 fewer employers than the year
before, when employers were turned away for lack of space.</TE>
<TE>   In past years, Occidental College in Eagle Rock has had 80
employers attend a single job fair, but this spring organizers are
expecting only half that number.</TE>
<TE>   "After Sept. 11, we saw a big dip in recruiting," said Judy
Fisher, director of Occidental's Career Development Center.</TE>
<TE>   Eileen Kohan, associate dean and executive director of career
planning and the placement center at USC, is considering adding a job
fair in April to "give employers an opportunity to take one more look
at our graduates."</TE>
<TE>   "People seem to be hiring closer to when they will actually need
employees," said Kohan, adding that about 8,000 students will come
out of USC's undergraduate and graduate school programs this year.</TE>
<TE>   At a job fair last fall at Occidental, Shinohara gave her resume
to 10 employers but has yet to get a single call. When she checked
around, she was told to call back in May.</TE>
<TE>   "It's definitely hard to find a job. I'm realizing it's taking a
lot longer than I expected," said Shinohara, 21, an international
relations and economics major. She is now applying for fellowships
that pay around $25,000 a year.</TE>
<TE>   She also considered AmeriCorps, the national community service
program, but she's not sure if she could survive on the $600 to $800
monthly stipend.</TE>
<TE>   "If worse comes to worse, I would get an administrative job, which
isn't my first choice after graduating from a four-year college," she
said.</TE>
<TE>   Purvi Tank, one of about 370 expected to graduate in May from
Occidental, has been offered a position with Morgan Stanley's finance
department in New York City. She is busy applying to other companies
to see if anyone can beat the offer. But when it comes down to it,
she said, she probably will accept. After sending out more than 50
resumes, it was Tank's only job interview.</TE>
<TE>   "It's been so difficult, so difficult. I can't tell you how many
cover letters I've tailored to specific companies. This is close
enough to my dream job. It's more than what I thought I was going to
be able to get," said Tank, an economics major.</TE>
<TE>   She declined to disclose the salary offer, saying only that she
will "make enough to be able to work and play in New York City."</TE>
<TE>   College career counselors advise graduating students--or anyone
looking for a job in this tight economic climate--to do their
homework, read the corporate profile, know the industry and go to the
interview with thoughtful questions.</TE>
<TE>   There are enough entry-level jobs to go around, despite a survey
of 50 Cal State Northridge students that revealed 90% of them weren't
sure they could get a job upon graduation, said Adele M. Scheele,
director of the university's career center. More than 6,000 students
will graduate this spring.</TE>
<TE>   "The expectation between three years ago and today is quite
amazing. This cloud of gloom pervades," said Scheele, author of five
books, including "Jump Start Your Career in College."</TE>
<TE>   Since graduating in December, Danielle Bacon has been working in
USC's career center, hoping the experience will help her land a
public relations job.</TE>
<TE>   She's been fine-tuning her resume and interview skills in
anticipation of sending out 40 to 50 "broadcast letters," alerting
potential employers that she will be returning to her hometown of
Fresno once her temporary job runs out in May.</TE>
<TE>   "I feel I have more work to do now than when I was in school,"
Bacon said. "The realities of the work force hit you the day you
graduate."</TE>

<HD>Race for Assembly Reprises Rift Between Latino Leaders</HD>
<DH>Cindy Montanez and Yolanda Fuentes vie for the 39th
District seat, backed by rivals Richard Alarcon and Tony Cardenas.</DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In a race shadowed by the political ambitions of their backers, Cindy
Montanez, the young mayor of San Fernando, has rocketed past her
rival in campaign fund-raising for an open state Assembly seat in the
northeast San Fernando Valley.</LD>
<LD>   But money doesn't necessarily spell victory in this poor, mostly
Latino area of stucco bungalows, where campaigns are more often won
by volunteers hammering signs into lawns than by consultants
bombarding mailboxes with slick fliers.</LD>
<LD>   Montanez and her Democratic primary opponent, Yolanda Fuentes,
another young, politically savvy Latina, march door to door almost
every evening seeking votes.</LD>
<TE>   Whatever their similarities--and there are many--their showdown in
the 39th Assembly District offers a reprise of a long-standing schism
in Valley politics: the rift between Assemblyman Tony Cardenas and
state Sen. Richard Alarcon.</TE>
<TE>   Once close allies, the Sylmar Democrats parted ways over the 1999
battle for Alarcon's old Los Angeles City Council seat, now held by
council President Alex Padilla. Alarcon spurned Padilla as too
inexperienced.</TE>
<TE>   It practically takes a flow chart to keep the tangled allegiances
straight. Now, with Alarcon backing the 28-year-old Montanez (who
once worked in his office) and Cardenas supporting the 27-year-old
Fuentes (his district director)--not to mention Padilla throwing his
weight behind Fuentes (a childhood friend)--the race promises to
reverberate beyond the 39th District.</TE>
<TE>   "There isn't a dime for the difference between them on the
issues," said Harvey Englander, a Democratic political consultant.
"So it's really a matter of building a power base rather than
governance."</TE>
<TE>   The working-class district runs from Sylmar to Sun Valley,
including Pacoima, Lake View Terrace and the city of San Fernando.
Now an undisputed bastion of Latino political might, it elected its
first Latino state lawmaker just six years ago: Cardenas.</TE>
<TE>   In the race to succeed him, Montanez has raised more than four
times as much cash and compiled a much longer list of endorsements
than Fuentes. But the Fuentes camp insists that it can close the gap,
noting that Padilla recently held a fund-raiser for her.</TE>
<TE>   "Cindy may have won the insider battle, but you've got to win the
election in the street," said Rick Taylor, a political strategist who
expects to sign on with the Fuentes campaign.</TE>
<TE>   As of Jan. 19, Montanez had raised $214,629 and lent her campaign
$9,000, according to the most recent campaign finance statements.
Fuentes had collected $49,870 and lent herself $35,000. Montanez
reported having $162,066 on hand, more than twice as much as Fuentes.</TE>
<TE>   Montanez, who grew up in a one-bedroom San Fernando house she
shared with her parents and five siblings, has always been a
go-getter. She's been bouncing out of bed at 5 a.m. since she was a
child (when the entire family used to go jogging), and she was a
competitive swimmer in high school.</TE>
<TE>   During her first year at UCLA, Montanez joined a two-week hunger
strike in support of the Chicano studies program. She later left
school to be an intern with Alarcon, and has been working and trying
to finish her studies ever since.</TE>
<TE>   In 1999, at 25, she was elected to the San Fernando City Council.
Last year her colleagues chose her as mayor.</TE>
<TE>   "There's never been a question in my head that my calling in life
is to serve this community," Montanez said.</TE>
<TE>   In nearby Pacoima, Yolanda Fuentes, the youngest of four girls,
was more of a musician than an athlete. She played the flute and
later took up the saxophone to join her high school marching band.</TE>
<TE>   Fuentes wanted to be a teacher, and at 18 she found a job at an
elementary school supervising meal programs and working as a
teacher's assistant. She went to Mission College and then transferred
to Cal State Northridge, graduating in 1997.</TE>
<TE>   But her plans veered toward politics when Padilla, then an aide to
Cardenas, suggested that Fuentes join their team. Three months later,
Fuentes was managing Cardenas' 1998 reelection campaign. She now
works with constituents in his Valley district.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm an advocate for the people," Fuentes said. "I really
understand the struggle of working families."</TE>
<TE>   In a district where registered Democrats outnumber Republicans by
3 to 1, winning the March 5 primary is tantamount to winning the
seat.</TE>
<TE>   On paper, the candidates' platforms are strikingly similar.</TE>
<TE>   Montanez said her top priority is public safety, promising in her
campaign literature to "tighten security at airports and other
vulnerable public places." She has also vowed to fight for more
school funding and to bolster neighborhoods with affordable housing
and clean industries.</TE>
<TE>   For Fuentes, education comes first. She has emphasized her work on
state legislation that created before- and after-school programs and
parent centers on campuses. Fuentes--who survived a carjacking in
August by leaping out of a moving vehicle--has also promised to
improve public safety and ensure affordable prescription drugs for
seniors.</TE>
<TE>   Even their respective supporters describe the women in parallel
terms.</TE>
<TE>   "She's very community-based, and she has a passion for helping
others," Padilla said of Fuentes. "She's about as dedicated as
anybody I've ever worked with," Cardenas agreed.</TE>
<TE>   Alarcon, for his part, called Montanez "intelligent beyond her
years," adding: "The other thing that was most noticeable was her
incredible passion for helping people."</TE>
<TE>   Both women say they are independent, devoted only to what's best
for constituents.</TE>
<TE>   This much is clear: An articulate, committed young woman, the
latest in a crop of home-grown leaders from the northeast Valley,
will soon be on her way to Sacramento.</TE>

<HD>Teacher Learns Lessons for Life</HD>
<DH>Education: Kids in hospital classroom provide retiring
instructor with daily examples of courage.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DANIEL YI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Shirley Lewis has taught some of the most determined students in
Orange County.</LD>
<LD>   They come to class despite limbs immobilized by casts, IV tubes
intruding into their veins and powerful drugs that sap their energy.
Many are terminally ill and have no hope of graduating.</LD>
<LD>   Lewis teaches at Children's Hospital of Orange County, the first
teacher in a program created 16 years ago to help sick children keep
up their schooling.</LD>
<TE>   ''School is normal. Chemotherapy isn't,'' said Lewis about the
role she plays in her students' lives.</TE>
<TE>   Now 63, the gentle woman who dispenses as many comforting words as
she does study lessons is retiring.</TE>
<TE>   It has been a career marked by inspiring tragedies.</TE>
<TE>   Last spring, a 16-year-old leukemia patient too sick to leave his
hospital bed asked Lewis to read Harry Potter to him.</TE>
<TE>   Lessons in the hospital must remain flexible, said Lewis, who
keeps a cabinet full of instruction materials, from kindergarten
reading to high school calculus.</TE>
<TE>   But some of the children are simply too weak, and often the most
the teacher can do is read to her student.</TE>
<TE>   "He would always remember the passage of the last chapter when I
forgot my [book] marker," said Lewis, remembering the month she spent
with the leukemia patient.</TE>
<TE>   He was a tall, good-looking boy who kept his sense of humor
despite the cancer, Lewis said. He died last Christmas at home.</TE>
<TE>   His mother later donated the entire Harry Potter series to Lewis'
school.</TE>
<TE>   She told Lewis how much those daily half-hours the teacher spent
with her son had meant to him.</TE>
<TE>   The job "has definitely affected me," Lewis said one recent
morning. But then she paused, perhaps unable to articulate 16 years'
worth of emotions, and excused herself to help one of her students.</TE>
<TE>   "I can generally tell when she's had a bad day," her husband John,
64, said from the couple's Anaheim home.</TE>
<TE>   "When one of the special ones--I mean, they are all special to
her--but when one of the kids she spent quite some time with passes
away, she's very, very quiet. Then we discuss her day, and I say,
'Boy, I couldn't do that.'"</TE>
<TE>   Most of Lewis' students, however, do make it.</TE>
<TE>   They are usually in the hospital for only a few days, but even
that can mean falling behind in school.</TE>
<TE>   The hospital program allows them to keep up, while offering a
welcome respite from the prodding and poking of medical instruments.</TE>
<TE>   The school is run by the Orange Unified School District's home and
hospital instruction program. Although the district has always
offered tutors to its local hospitals, including UCI Medical Center
and Chapman Medical Center, Children's Hospital was the first in the
county to get a full-time credentialed teacher.</TE>
<TE>   Two years ago, HealthBridge Children's Rehabilitation Hospital, a
children's facility in Orange, also gained an in-house school.</TE>
<TE>   Children staying less than five days are not officially the Orange
district's responsibility, but Lewis considers them all her students.</TE>
<TE>   Those from other school districts bring homework to the hospital
and can count on Lewis for assistance.</TE>
<TE>   "We will find someone for the job," when Lewis retires, said Nancy
Shipcott, the district's administrative director of pupil services.
"But we won't find a replacement for Shirley."</TE>
<TE>   Lewis is slender and subtly elegant, with neatly cropped white
hair and a warm smile.</TE>
<TE>   The Iowa native moved to Norwalk in 1959 where she met her
husband, an aerospace engineer. The couple married and moved to
Anaheim 40 years ago.</TE>
<TE>   While their two children were growing up, Lewis was a substitute
teacher for the Orange district. When her youngest was ready for
college, the hospital position opened up and Lewis decided to teach
full-time.</TE>
<TE>   She Can Quickly Bond With Students</TE>
<TE>   Teaching vulnerable children, some of whom are battling fatal
diseases, can be very emotional, Lewis said.</TE>
<TE>   "It is amazing how much you can bond with a kid even in a short
period of time.... These kids go through so much pain throughout
their treatments. You just have to have faith that it is not going to
happen," that she won't lose another child.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, it was her students who ran the risk of losing Lewis.
She was diagnosed with breast cancer. It is in remission now, but
during her treatment she took inspiration from the hospital's little
patients.</TE>
<TE>   "When you see a 3-year-old playing with a ball in the hall,
pulling an IV post....If they can do it," Lewis said she told
herself, "I can certainly do it."</TE>
<TE>   Lewis decided to retire to spend more time with her husband, who
has been retired for the last six years.</TE>
<TE>   She said she will return to the hospital as a part-time volunteer.</TE>
<TE>   Until then, Lewis will continue her routine. She begins at 7:30
a.m. examining her constantly changing roster.</TE>
<TE>   She visits students in their rooms, assessing those who can attend
class and those she will have to teach from their bedside.</TE>
<TE>   She opens the hospital's two classrooms about 9:30 a.m. and
students begin to shuffle in, medical equipment in tow.</TE>
<TE>   Lewis and her teaching aide, Debbie Violette, work with about a
dozen students each day in the classrooms.</TE>
<TE>   Lewis later visits the handful of bed-bound students, often
staying long past her 3:30 p.m. checkout time.</TE>
<TE>   The third-floor classroom is reserved for the hospital's cancer
patients.</TE>
<TE>   One recent morning, Lewis was going over a reading lesson with
Jorge Perez, 9, a leukemia patient who is awaiting a bone marrow
transplant.</TE>
<TE>   His mother, Elena Gonzalez, a Garden Grove homemaker, watched
nearby.</TE>
<TE>   "The school helps him a lot," Gonzalez, 27, said. "It keeps his
mind off of the cancer. It makes him feel normal."</TE>
<TE>   Making her students feel normal is a big part of Lewis' job. When
a student's IV monitor sounds an alarm, Lewis casually asks a
hospital volunteer to page a nurse, and proceeds with her lessons.
Her students remain calm.</TE>
<TE>   They also hardly noticed one recent morning when a 12-year-old boy
was wheeled into the fifth-floor classroom.</TE>
<TE>   The fifth floor is where all the noncancer patients are located.</TE>
<TE>   The boy's body was contorted, his movements not entirely his. He
can't speak, and lets out murmurs and short grunts. He has been in
and out of the hospital for years, Lewis later said.</TE>
<TE>   "Thanks for coming," she greeted him cheerily. "What would you
like to do today?"</TE>
<TE>   His eyes darted from side to side, and, apparently finding nothing
of interest, he wheeled himself out of the room with the little
coordination left in his body.</TE>
<TE>   Lewis' attention returned to the spunky 6-year-old girl she was
teaching how to count.</TE>
<TE>   Minutes later the boy was back, in through another door.</TE>
<TE>   He slowly wheeled his chair and eased it between Lewis and the
girl.</TE>
<TE>   "Oh! You are back," Lewis said. "We missed you."</TE>
<TE>   The boy stared at Lewis, his head swaying beyond his control, his
neck craning toward her.</TE>
<TE>   Then his eyes moved to the lesson sheet on the table. Lewis
continued.</TE>
<TE>   "OK! So how many toothbrushes here?" she said. "Let's count them.
1, 2, 3...."</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>I got invited to an arts festival at the Accelerated School in
South-Central Los Angeles last June, and one thing in particular
jumped out at me. The place was mobbed with families.</LD>
<LD>   I'm not talking about one parent here and there. In many cases,
both parents had shown up, along with brothers, sisters, cousins,
grandparents, neighbors. It was like an extended family picnic, and
the live entertainment included a killer third-grade mariachi king.</LD>
<LD>   I don't know much about the science of education, and I can't
begin to explain how a country of unlimited wealth and resources is
so astoundingly inept when it comes to teaching our children. But my
experience, which includes raising two sons, tells me the best public
schools always have at least two things going for them: inspired
teachers and involved parents.</LD>
<TE>   Accelerated, a public charter school with just 270 students, has
both, along with test scores that soar above the average in the Los
Angeles Unified School District. So how do they do it?</TE>
<TE>   First of all, Accelerated has all the advantages that come with
being cut loose from the bureaucratic morass and labor problems of
the mother ship--LAUSD. It also has parents who care enough about
their children's education that they applied to Accelerated in the
first place.</TE>
<TE>   But the school's founders believe much of what they've
accomplished is transferable to other schools, including parent
involvement.</TE>
<TE>   "At my old school, parents were really not welcome at all," says
kindergarten teacher Steven Hicks, who moved to Accelerated from
another campus this year and was named one of 12 L.A. County teachers
of the year in September. "No one knew anyone by name, and if a
parent showed up at school, the attitude was, 'Why are you here?'"</TE>
<TE>   At Accelerated, parents are in trouble if they don't show up. In
fact, they sign a contract that obligates them to spend three hours a
month on campus and to attend at least five monthly parent meetings.
The whole-family approach is so important to Accelerated that the
school has a student and family services coordinator named Vinh X.
Luong.</TE>
<TE>   Brenda Hall has two daughters at Accelerated and a son at a nearby
school with 2,300 students. At Accelerated, 100 parents or more crowd
into every meeting. "At my son's school, it's usually about three
people," Hall says.</TE>
<TE>   So where are all the others? I'd bet the bank that most of them
are home watching some idiot show on television, and then carping and
moaning about the lousy school their kids go to, if they give a hoot
at all.</TE>
<TE>   Accelerated uses another tool to keep parents engaged and children
accountable. Let's say sisters Crystal, Tiffany or Jazmine Griffin
were to get home from school one day and tell Mom there's no homework
tonight. First of all, there's always homework, and Marivia
Torres-Griffin knows that better than anyone. Despite having a
full-time job, she's on campus almost as much as the students, doing
everything from assisting teachers to helping administrators craft
extracurricular programs. But if one of Marivia's daughters has
simply forgotten the assignment, it's available by phone on a
recorded message left by the teacher.</TE>
<TE>   A student couldn't take a slide if she wanted to. Her parents are
on campus, they're at meetings, they're in classrooms learning
algebra and whatnot so they can help with homework at night, and
they're in direct telephone and e-mail contact with the teachers.
It's the lazy student's nightmare, and it gets even worse.</TE>
<TE>   Accelerated teachers make house calls.</TE>
<TE>   "It makes parents more well-informed about me, and it makes me
more well-informed about the family," says Hicks, who has visited the
homes of 10 students and plans to complete the other 10 by year's
end. At one home, where Hicks had dinner, he discovered his student's
father is a professional pianist. The parent will soon be showing
students a thing or two on the school piano.</TE>
<TE>   Accelerated's teachers are nonunion, which makes for another
advantage over regular public schools. Hicks says most teachers were
out the door at 3 at his old school, but 4:30 is quitting time at
Accelerated.</TE>
<TE>   LAUSD Supt. Roy Romer will be a member of the U.S. figure-skating
team before the union considers a longer day or home visits. But
Hicks, a union supporter, said his ex-colleagues would gladly log
more hours under the right circumstances. "Most of us stay here until
6 or 6:30 because we're so motivated."</TE>
<TE>   Accelerated has one more advantage, and it's a critical one. If a
parent doesn't get involved like the contract requires, the student
can be tossed out of school. Regular public schools can't do that,
Romer notes. But because all the research shows that parent
involvement makes such a critical difference in student performance,
he believes the district has to borrow as much as it can from the
Accelerated model.</TE>
<TE>   "All of it can be transferred to some degree and should be. We
need all the parent involvement we can get," Romer said.</TE>
<TE>   One subdistrict within LAUSD just began what's called a compact
with parents, and local Supt. Richard Alonzo said it's gotten many
more parents involved in their children's education. If that trend
can be taken districtwide, Romer said, along with breaking huge
schools into smaller and more manageable academies, there's hope.</TE>
<TE>   Many moons will pass before that happens. But until then the
Accelerated School, founded eight years ago by two frustrated
teachers who believed we should demand more of teachers, parents and
students, stands as a model of the possibilities.</TE>
<TE>   Steven Hicks, after 14 years in L.A. public schools, had this to
say about his new job: "I feel like I've died and gone to teacher
heaven."</TE>

<HD>Patagonia Again Tops for Workers</HD>
<DH>Business: Strong focus on environment and employees lifts
Ventura-based outdoor clothing maker to No. 41 on Fortune magazine's
annual list.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>FRED ALVAREZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Maybe it was the organic food dished out at Patagonia's cafeteria
that swayed Fortune magazine.</LD>
<LD>   Or maybe it was the on-site child care, company-sponsored training
sessions in nonviolent civil disobedience or the $2,000 employee
incentive to buy environmentally friendly vehicles.</LD>
<LD>   Whatever the reason, Fortune has again named Patagonia one of the
100 best companies to work for in America, citing the Ventura-based
outdoor clothing maker as a shining example of corporate excellence
in these dark times of recession and layoffs.</LD>
<TE>   The company, which has 1,000 employees worldwide and last year
sold $223 million worth of clothing, has made Fortune's Top 100 list
each of the five years it has been published. It ranked 41st this
year--up 17 places from 2001.</TE>
<TE>   But even in this climate of corporate mergers and meltdowns, Chief
Executive Michael Crooke wants employees to know he's not willing to
settle for the middle of the pack when it comes to measuring up
against the best.</TE>
<TE>   "There just can't be 40 other companies out there that are better
than Patagonia," said Crooke, an intense ex-Navy SEAL who has guided
the company since October 1999.</TE>
<TE>   "I want to do all we can to be No. 1," he said. "This just tells
me we have a lot of work to do."</TE>
<TE>   So it goes at Patagonia, long known as much for its environmental
activism as its willingness to blur the lines between work and home
life.</TE>
<TE>   The company provides employees flexible work schedules and gives
new mothers and fathers two months paid leave. It offers yoga classes
and surf lessons and encourages workers, when the waves are good, to
grab their boards and head for the water.</TE>
<TE>   The outfitter also wears its environmental activism on its sleeve,
providing two months paid leave for employees to work for the
environmental nonprofit group of their choice and pledging 1% of
sales or 10% of pretax profits, whichever is greater, to preservation
and restoration efforts. Those contributions have totaled $17 million
since the program's inception in 1985.</TE>
<TE>   "Our product is not only the clothing we make," Crooke said.
"Everything we do to promote a sense of community, that is the
brilliance of this company."</TE>
<TE>   Ventura resident Samuel Andrade Gonzalez has bought into
Patagonia's philosophy.</TE>
<TE>   The 30-year-old Mexican immigrant was busing tables in Oxnard
before landing a job in Patagonia's stock room nine years ago. He
worked his way up over the years and now is in charge of a
computer-controlled machine that cuts prototypes for future fashion
lines.</TE>
<TE>   He has also taken advantage of the company's perks, taking two
months paid leave when his daughter, Natalia, was born four years
ago. The youngster is enrolled in Patagonia's on-site child-care
program and accompanies her father to work every day.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it's wonderful to work for a company that gives you time
to spend time with your kid," said Gonzalez, who has another
two-month leave and a second child on the way. "It's just great to be
part of a company that stands for more than the financial. They give
me the tools to be a man."</TE>
<TE>   It was testimonials such as these that helped return Patagonia to
Fortune's Top 100 list. Companies in business for at least seven
years and with more than 500 employees are eligible, and 279 applied
for consideration this year.</TE>
<TE>   Two-thirds of a company's score is based on how randomly selected
employees responded to a confidential survey measuring trust in
management and pride in the workplace. The remainder of the score is
based on the magazine's evaluation of workplace practices.</TE>
<TE>   Patagonia was the only Ventura County company to make the Top 100.
Seventeen other firms in California made the list.</TE>
<TE>   In a brief company profile, the magazine noted that nearly a
quarter of Patagonia's employees are minorities and that more than
half are women. It also showed that the company had 9,000
applications for 32 new jobs last year.</TE>
<TE>   "One of the reasons we are so proud of this honor is that
two-thirds of the rating criteria is based on employee surveys," said
Lu Setnicka, the company's public affairs director. "It shows people
feel very good about working here."</TE>
<TE>   And why not? It is the kind of place where employees walk around
barefoot and melt into beanbag chairs during design meetings. It's
the kind of place where the lunch menu consists of soba noodles and
miso soup. It's the kind of place where the guy who answers the
phones is a one-time world champion Frisbee player who gives every
new employee surfing lessons.</TE>
<TE>   "This is not just a group of individuals, it's a community," said
Crooke, adding that the company has done well because it has never
strayed from its commitment to social, environmental and fiscal
responsibility.</TE>
<TE>   "Are finances important? Absolutely. But they are not more
important than the social responsibilities or the environmental
responsibilities of our company," Crooke said.</TE>

<HD>Escalating the War Against Predator Pike</HD>
<DH>Environment: State wildlife agency plans to use detonator
cord in Lake Davis to kill the fierce fish that dines on prized
trout. Critics say the effort is doomed.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BETTINA BOXALL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>They have been poisoned, stunned and scooped into nets. Soon, they
may be blown up.</LD>
<LD>   This spring, the state plans to launch a new line of attack on the
thus-far-indomitable northern pike of Lake Davis. The Department of
Fish and Game intends to explode detonation cord in pockets of the
Plumas County reservoir to kill the unwanted pike, which prey on the
lake's trout.</LD>
<LD>   The process will not, the department says, be like setting off
land mines. Rather, the small explosions will send pressure waves
into the water, bursting the air bladders of any nearby fish. They
will die, but most will stay relatively intact.</LD>
<TE>   The planned assault is the latest strategy in state attempts to
control the northern pike, a big, hungry fish that mysteriously made
its way into the lake in the early 1990s and refused to leave.</TE>
<TE>   The state dumped chemical poison into Lake Davis in 1997, wiping
out its fish population. But some pike survived. They have since
rapidly reproduced, and last summer, more than 6,300 pike were taken
from the lake by fish and game personnel.</TE>
<TE>   For now, the fish and game department seems to have given up hope
of ridding Lake Davis of the pike. The goal instead is to control
their numbers so they don't destroy the lake's prized trout fishery
or spread downstream, where they could wreak havoc on valuable salmon
fisheries.</TE>
<TE>   Detonation cords have been used before in California to kill fish
threatening salmon in the Eel River system on the North Coast, said
fish and game senior biologist Ivan Paulsen. They have never been
used in Lake Davis, which in the past has functioned as a drinking
water source for local communities.</TE>
<TE>   A recently released environmental report, now under public review,
concluded that detonation would have no significant impact on the
lake. Paulsen said experiments conducted for the study indicated that
the detonations would leave some trace chemicals in the lake, but in
quantities so minute they would be undetectable.</TE>
<TE>   The detonations would kill any nearby fish and amphibians,
including the lake's trout. Trout would be restocked, and some of the
dead trout would be left onshore as food for bald eagles that nest
nearby.</TE>
<TE>   Fran Roudebush, chairwoman of the Lake Davis Steering Committee,
said that once locals understand that the state is not going to blow
up the lake, they are not objecting to the plan. A public hearing on
the matter will be held Tuesday in Portola.</TE>
<TE>   More controversial, she said, is talk about draining the lake to
get rid of the pike. Fish and game officials have placed that option
at the bottom of their list.</TE>
<TE>   But Plumas County supervisors have expressed an interest in having
the state drain the reservoir and store the water downstream, so the
county could sell it and use the revenue to offset losses in tourism
and sport fishing that the region would suffer until the lake
refills. That would include buying any homes people wanted to sell
when the lake was dry.</TE>
<TE>   The supervisors have contacted the state about the proposal but
have not received a response, said county Supervisor B.J. Pearson.</TE>
<TE>   Residents have no particular objection to the detonation plan, he
added. But, "at best, it's going to kill a few pike. It's not going
to solve the problem."</TE>
<TE>   Biologist Paulsen said the detonations should kill pike quite
efficiently. A one-acre test detonation will be conducted in the
reservoir in April. Water quality will be sampled as well as the
intensity of the shock waves.</TE>
<TE>   If all goes well, the state would use detonation cord in areas of
up to 10 acres where pike are concentrated. In 2003 and 2004, areas
of up to 20 acres would be treated.</TE>
<TE>   Resembling clothesline, the cord would be run in lengths back and
forth through the water. Any fish within 21 feet of a detonation
would be killed.</TE>

<HD>FBI Flooded With Applicants</HD>
<DH>Safety: With 900 jobs to fill nationwide, the agency is
trying to sort through thousands of applications received since the
Sept. 11 attacks.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>WILLIAM OVEREND</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Pushing to bolster anti-terrorism forces, FBI officials throughout
California are scrambling to help meet a nationwide goal of hiring
more than 900 agents in the next eight months.</LD>
<LD>   One of the biggest problems facing the state's four major FBI
offices--in Los Angeles, San Francisco, San Diego and Sacramento--is
sorting through the thousands of applications received since Sept.
11.</LD>
<LD>   "It's busier than I've ever seen it," said Jan Caldwell, FBI
spokeswoman in San Diego and an agent for 27 years.</LD>
<TE>   "And the quality of the applicants is just incredible. We are
literally getting rocket scientists applying."</TE>
<TE>   There are 500 applicants in the pipeline from San Diego alone,
Caldwell added. "We have a tax lawyer and several doctors applying,
one woman with a doctorate in philosophy, another with degrees in
electrical engineering and computer science," she said.</TE>
<TE>   The FBI's hiring goal, announced last month, is one of the largest
calls for new agents since the peak of the Vietnam War, Caldwell
said. The FBI has about 11,000 agents worldwide, and typically gets
25,000 applications a year, Caldwell estimated.</TE>
<TE>   "In the past, the spikes in people applying to be agents came from
television or the movies," Caldwell said. "First came Efrem Zimbalist
Jr.'s FBI series. Then there was 'Silence of the Lambs.' In the '90s,
it was 'X Files.' This time it was Sept. 11, and that obviously makes
a difference."</TE>
<TE>   FBI officials in the four main California offices said they have
no tally of applications received since then. But Annette Nowak,
recruiting agent for the Los Angeles office, said that office alone
began receiving about 100 job applications a day after Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   'It's Not Just a Law Enforcement Job'</TE>
<TE>   "It has dropped off, but we are still getting a ton of calls," she
said. "They are thinking differently about the FBI now, I think. It's
not just a law enforcement job now. It's people wanting to help
America. It's a lot more personal."</TE>
<TE>   Nick Rossi, FBI spokesman in Sacramento, said his office typically
processes 50 to 60 applications a month. The Sacramento office has
doubled its testing schedule because of the increase in applicants.</TE>
<TE>   "We saw a huge spike right after Sept. 11, but many of those were
motivated by a quick burst of patriotic enthusiasm that later
cooled," Rossi said. "Still, the interest is very high. We get lots
of calls from high school and college students still too young to
apply, but that is a good sign for the future."</TE>
<TE>   FBI officials said there are about 650 agents in the Los Angeles
office, 320 in San Francisco, about 250 in San Diego and more than
100 in Sacramento.</TE>
<TE>   Together, records show, the four offices annually process about
11% of the FBI's total of recruits nationwide. The Los Angeles office
frequently has produced more agents than any other office nationally.</TE>
<TE>   Announcing the hiring goal for 2002, the FBI said its priorities
are people with computer, engineering, science and foreign language
skills, especially such languages as Arabic, Farsi, Pashtu and Urdu.
But skills in Spanish, Russian, Japanese and many other languages
remain in high demand.</TE>
<TE>   California traditionally has produced many of the FBI's
Spanish-speaking agents as well as recruits fluent in Middle East
languages. About a third of the 900,000 Arab Americans in the United
States live in Los Angeles and Orange counties.</TE>
<TE>   Nationwide, Nowak said, the FBI has had 19,000 job applications
from people with language skills since Sept. 11. Many recruits are in
the hiring pipeline, a difficult process of testing and evaluation
that usually takes more than six months.</TE>
<TE>   "Without lowering our standards, we are trying to speed up the
process where we can," Nowak said. Many offices have added agents to
their recruiting teams, and the Los Angeles office is conducting a
preliminary written test twice a month instead of once.</TE>
<TE>   Immediately after Sept. 11, that office was so swamped with calls
that officials had to set up two crisis teams just to handle the
phones. One group handled tips and the other processed job
applications.</TE>
<TE>   Most applicants are eliminated at the start of the process because
they fail to meet basic qualifications. Agents, for example, must be
at least 23.</TE>
<TE>   The next step is a four-hour written test, which focuses on
psychological traits as well as general knowledge. Typical question:
If you were shopping and you saw someone robbing the store, what
would you do?</TE>
<TE>   Mike Hilliard, who retired three years ago after 21 years as the
chief recruiting agent in Los Angeles, estimated that about half of
those who take the written test pass it and advance to competitive
oral interviews.</TE>
<TE>   Then comes a physical exam and an FBI polygraph test, mostly on
national security and drug use questions. (A serious drug history
disqualifies a candidate, but very limited drug experimentation
doesn't.)</TE>
<TE>   Hilliard said that about 20% of those who make it to the polygraph
stage fail the test.</TE>
<TE>   Agency Needs to Meet Its Hiring Goals</TE>
<TE>   From 1996 to this year, California's four primary FBI offices
tested 4,724 applicants, and 466 recruits were offered jobs.
Officials said they expect the totals this year to be dramatically
higher than the yearly totals during that period.</TE>
<TE>   As FBI recruiters see it, the high number of applicants this year
should help the bureau meet its goal of more than 900 new agents.</TE>
<TE>   On the other hand, sorting through them all could slow things
down.</TE>
<TE>   "It cuts both ways," said San Diego's Caldwell. "But the bureau
usually meets its hiring goals and we will probably meet them this
year. We need them more than ever before."</TE>

<HD>Keep Parks, Delgadillo Says</HD>
<DH>Politics: City attorney offers high-profile support of LAPD
chief's bid for a second five-year term. Some find his action
inappropriate.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Los Angeles City Atty. Rocky Delgadillo on Sunday endorsed Police
Chief Bernard C. Parks for a second term, calling him a committed
leader whose service has distinguished the Los Angeles Police
Department.</LD>
<LD>   Delgadillo announced his endorsement during morning services at
the First AME Church in Los Angeles. He was joined on the pulpit by
the Rev. Cecil "Chip" Murray, Parks and his wife Bobbi, Rep. Diane
Watson (D-Los Angeles) and City Councilman Mark Ridley-Thomas.</LD>
<LD>   "He is a man of impeccable personal conviction, strong
character--strong enough to uncover [the] Rampart [corruption
scandal]--and he is a man I am proud to call my friend," Delgadillo
said after hugging the chief as the congregation applauded and
cheered.</LD>
<TE>   Delgadillo is one of the first city officials to publicly back
Parks, who announced Thursday night that he wants a second five-year
term. The chief's bid for reappointment will be considered by the
five-member Police Commission appointed by Mayor James K. Hahn. The
mayor has not publicly expressed an opinion about the decision facing
his commissioners.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it's important to have this kind of endorsement because I
think Rocky Delgadillo clearly understands the need for consistent
law enforcement effort in the city," Parks told reporters outside the
church.</TE>
<TE>   But Police Commission President Rick Caruso criticized
Delgadillo's endorsement, saying it creates a conflict of interest
because the city attorney's office is responsible for advising the
commission during the reappointment process--and the office would
probably be consulted about the legal implications of reappointing
Parks or of refusing him a second term.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm surprised and disappointed that the city attorney would do
that," Caruso said. "It seems to taint everything."</TE>
<TE>   Caruso said the commission must now seek outside counsel to guide
the panel.</TE>
<TE>   Ben Austin, Delgadillo's communications director, said the city
attorney considered the ramifications of his endorsement and decided
that, as a citywide elected official, he had an obligation to voice
his opinion.</TE>
<TE>   Delgadillo is not the first city attorney to jump into the
politics of the department. Hahn was criticized roundly by other city
officials in 1996 when, as city attorney, he endorsed Chief Willie L.
Williams for reappointment.</TE>
<TE>   During his remarks at the First AME Church, Delgadillo cautioned
that his endorsement is "not a blank check."</TE>
<TE>   He called for the LAPD to implement a federal consent decree
mandating reform of the force and to recruit more officers, improve
community policing and boost the morale of the rank and file.</TE>
<TE>   Hahn, who does not have a formal role in the reappointment process
unless the Police Commission does not act, has said he will voice his
opinion about the chief at some point during Parks' evaluation.</TE>
<TE>   The relationship between the mayor and his chief has not been
completely smooth. Since taking office in July, Hahn has pushed for
several measures over Parks' objections, including a flexible work
schedule for police officers.</TE>
<TE>   Hahn did not attend the party Thursday night at a Hollywood club
celebrating the chief's 37th anniversary with the LAPD. On Sunday,
Parks' wife, Bobbi, said she sent the mayor an invitation. Julie
Wong, a spokeswoman for the mayor, said Hahn did not receive it.</TE>

<HD>Skateboard Park Taking Off in Ojai</HD>
<DH>Recreation: City officials seek funds to build a permanent
10,000-square-foot facility.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CARRI KARUHN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Teenager Beau Farrar, who rides his skateboard at the city's
temporary skate park nearly every day, is the sort of young Ojai
resident the City Council wants to please.</LD>
<LD>   The 7,200-square-foot park next to Chaparral High School is one of
the few places Beau and his friends can practice their skills without
being chased away by police or merchants, who don't always appreciate
boarders sliding down handrails or grinding across flowerpot ledges
outside their stores.</LD>
<LD>   The 2-year-old facility has proved so popular with the city's
youth, the city now plans to build a permanent skate park downtown,
near Ojai Avenue and Fox Street.</LD>
<TE>   "They're the ultimate users," said Carol Belser, Ojai's recreation
director. "We're building it for them."</TE>
<TE>   The recreation department has requested proposals by Feb. 20 from
several landscape architects to determine the cost to design a
10,000-square-foot concrete structure that would have restrooms, a
storage area, benches, bicycle racks and drinking fountains.</TE>
<TE>   By late March, if the city selects a design firm, recreation
officials would hold a series of public workshops to ask local
skateboarders and other residents what they would like at the new
park.</TE>
<TE>   Beau, 13, and his friends have a clear idea: more ramps, rails and
stairs to practice on and a structure made of concrete, rather than
wood, which tends to warp and slow down skaters.</TE>
<TE>   "[Concrete] is faster," Beau said. "It rolls better on your
wheels, and it lasts longer, [and doesn't get] bumps that trip you."</TE>
<TE>   Belser said she plans to ask the council to include funds to build
the park in its fiscal 2002-2003 budget. The cost is estimated at
$250,000 to $300,000.</TE>
<TE>   The council would still have to approve construction, but city and
district officials have already given the concept their blessings.</TE>
<TE>   "We've had nothing but good experiences since the temporary park
went in," said Assistant Supt. Jim Berube. "It's been a great place.
It's full of kids all the time. The key is that it's supervised and
is very visible from the street."</TE>
<TE>   Mayor Steve Olsen, who is also principal of Chaparral High School,
agreed. "It's used all the time. . . . They seem to enjoy it, and
it's a healthy activity." he said. "It's been successful and it's
proven itself to earn a permanent status."</TE>
<TE>   Similar parks have been built in Camarillo, Thousand Oaks and
Ventura.</TE>
<TE>   John Williamson, general manager of Pleasant Valley Recreation and
Park District, said the 12,000-square-foot concrete facility in
Camarillo averages 250 to 300 kids daily.</TE>
<TE>   "Skateboarding is a sport just like any other sport," Williamson
said. "These kids have a right to have a place to do their thing.
It's nice to have it in a park, so they aren't in danger of being hit
by a car."</TE>
<TE>   Ojai's new park would be open to in-line skaters, as well as BMX
bike riders at certain times, officials said. Chaparral High students
would likely continue to use the park during school hours as part of
their regular physical education curriculum. But a lease agreement
between the school district and city, which would continue to own and
operate the skate park, must still be worked out.</TE>
<TE>   In 1999, the school district agreed to let the city build a
temporary skateboarding facility in a park-and-ride lot outside the
high school. The city leases 22 parking spaces for $4,268. They house
the $50,000 wood skateboarding structure, which features ramps,
rails, inclines and ledges. It hasn't caused a parking problem, as
the lot is rarely full on weekdays, city officials said.</TE>
<TE>   Capt. Gary Pentis, who oversees the Ventura County sheriff's
station in Ojai, said he has noticed few problems associated with the
park since it opened.</TE>
<TE>   "Kids enjoy it," Pentis said. "And it's obviously given them a
place to skate, which has curtailed a lot of [skating] activity in
the business area."</TE>
<TE>   Complaints from local business owners are down, he said.</TE>
<TE>   About 30 skateboarders gathered at the outdoor facility recently,
grinding across wooden ledges and sliding across metal rails. They
jumped orange construction cones set up as obstacles and made
split-second maneuvers to avoid crashing into each other.</TE>
<TE>   "It's fun. It's active," said Darya Brutoco, 13, of Ojai, who
visits the park at least three times a week. "It's something to do
when you're bored, if you have no where to go."</TE>
<TE>   Resident John Lobdell, who stopped by to watch his son, Nick, 11,
said it's obvious the city needs a larger skate park.</TE>
<TE>   "You can see all the kids here. They're crawling all over each
other," he said. "If kids have stuff to do, they don't get in
trouble. They really need to have this."</TE>

<HD>Man Held in Wife's Stabbing Death</HD>
<DH>Crime: He is arrested after killing her in front of the
couple's three daughters, Orange County deputies say.</DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A Laguna Niguel man was being held on suspicion of murder Sunday
after stabbing his wife to death in front of their three children,
authorities said.</LD>
<LD>   Responding to the daughters' frantic calls for help late Saturday,
neighbors--including an off-duty security guard--restrained the man
until Orange County sheriff's deputies arrived.</LD>
<LD>   Attempts were made to revive Maria Andrade Rios, 40, but she died
in the family's apartment from knife wounds to her upper body and
throat, witnesses and authorities said.</LD>
<TE>   Arnulfo Perez Rios, 44, is being held without bail at Orange
County Jail on suspicion of killing his wife. He is scheduled to be
arraigned today.</TE>
<TE>   Jeffrey Veyera, 31, who lives next door to the Rios family at the
Windridge Apartments, said he was awakened about 11:30 p.m. by
banging, angry shouts and a woman's screams. He said that he called
911 and ran outside. "One of the girls came running out and said her
father had stabbed her mother," Veyera said.</TE>
<TE>   Another neighbor said she saw one of the girls running up and down
the driveway, pleading for help, while a sister was calling 911 on a
phone she was clutching.</TE>
<TE>   "The girl was screaming," recalled Lupe Jimenez, 17. "She was
running by. She was asking for help. She said that her mom was
bleeding."</TE>
<TE>   Police dispatchers said they received several 911 calls within
seconds: "There's some sort of disturbance," one caller reported.
"There's a lady running downstairs yelling for help. There was
slamming. There was screaming....There was some pounding."</TE>
<TE>   As the emergency calls were made, neighbors ran into the Rioses'
apartment. Veyera and the off-duty security guard who lives upstairs
sat with Rios, while two other people tried to save his wife, who was
on the floor of the bedroom.</TE>
<TE>   Arnulfo Rios was covered with blood and had the smell of alcohol
on his breath, Veyera said. Rios was not crying, Veyera added, "but
he was very, very agitated."</TE>
<TE>   Veyera said he had overheard screaming coming from the family's
apartment. Rios, he said, was angry at his wife, who had insulted him
with profanity.</TE>
<TE>   Veyera quoted Rios as saying: "I told her not to do it. I told her
not to do it." Veyera said that Rios later told him: "Is this real? I
can't believe this is real."</TE>
<TE>   Homicide detectives interviewed Rios on Sunday, but declined to
elaborate on the couple's argument. Jim Amormino, a spokesman for the
Orange County Sheriff's Department, said that the woman had been
stabbed several times with a kitchen knife.</TE>
<TE>   Veyera and another neighbor said they feared Rios might try to
hurt himself or others. The off-duty security guard handcuffed Rios,
who did not fight back, and held him until deputies arrived, Veyera
said.</TE>
<TE>   The couple's daughters, ages 11, 13 and 18, went to Veyera's home
to wait for other family members; they have two brothers, a
20-year-old in the Navy and another who is a few years older. Trauma
counselors also were called in to talk with the girls.</TE>
<TE>   The couple has no reported history of domestic violence, said
Amormino. Neighbors at the Hidden Hills Road apartment complex said
Sunday that the family had never caused a disturbance.</TE>
<TE>   "They didn't seem like they ever fought or anything. Never.
Nothing," said Sunny Mathews. "They sounded like they were having a
good time all the time. They seemed like a happy family."</TE>
<TE>   Another neighbor, Katie Laird, a substitute teacher at Niguel
Hills Middle School who has taught two of the Rios girls, described
the mother as "always smiling and very friendly."</TE>
<TE>   Investigators searched the Rioses' home Sunday morning and seized
a number of items, including a computer. One neighbor left a bouquet
of pink roses and daisies.</TE>
<TE>   "It happened so quickly," Veyera. "I don't believe there was
anything we could have done. I wish we could have."</TE>

<HD>Separate Valley Bus System Plan Is Losing Steam</HD>
<DH>Transit: With uncertainty over whether an independent
network could pay for itself, decentralization idea is gaining
ground.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CAITLIN LIU</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A push for a breakaway bus system in the San Fernando Valley is
losing momentum to a proposal that would give communities more local
control within the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, officials
say.</LD>
<LD>   MTA board members say it is increasingly uncertain that an
independent Valley system could pay for itself.</LD>
<LD>   That has strengthened the prospects of MTA Chief Executive Roger
Snoble's plan to decentralize the agency into five semiautonomous
sectors, including a Valley one.</LD>
<TE>   "I think the sector concept is going to be the winner," said
Lancaster Mayor Frank C. Roberts, who sits on the MTA board and in
the past has backed a Valley split.</TE>
<TE>   Supporters of a Valley system have not given up the fight. But the
13-member MTA board must approve Valley independence, and agency
insiders say that appears less and less likely.</TE>
<TE>   A joint powers authority plans to formally petition the MTA within
60 days for a Valley divorce. The local-control sentiments behind the
proposal are similar to those fueling the Valley secession campaign,
which would carve a new city out of Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   An independent Valley transit network would be entirely free of
the MTA, with its own board and budget.</TE>
<TE>   Snoble's alternative would give the Valley and the other sectors
their own general managers as well as community councils, which would
rule on matters such as routes and schedules. However, the MTA would
maintain ultimate control.</TE>
<TE>   Advocates of a Valley breakaway often point to the "Foothill
model," referring to a bus system in the east San Gabriel Valley that
separated from the MTA's predecessor in the late 1980s. By cutting
labor expenses, Foothill Transit was able to improve its bus service
while saving money.</TE>
<TE>   But even ardent supporters of a Valley system acknowledge that the
Foothill approach cannot be duplicated today. Laws adopted a year and
a half ago require new bus agencies to pay wages and benefits on par
with those received by MTA workers.</TE>
<TE>   That would prevent a Valley network from slashing its labor costs,
transit experts say. Unions representing MTA employees oppose a
Valley split.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, financial forecasts for a Valley bus operation have
been up and down. A December 2000 report concluded that an
independent system could run buses for less than the MTA, and thus
save $42.6 million over 10 years.</TE>
<TE>   But subsequent studies based on revised assumptions, such as lower
state and federal subsidies, have predicted deficits.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, it was estimated that a Valley bus zone would incur a
deficit of at least $10.4 million over 10 years. The most recent
analysis, released last week, estimated a $59.9-million shortfall
over a decade.</TE>
<TE>   "Why would the cities take on the responsibilities of an MTA role
if it's going to result in expenses for them rather than a surplus?"
said Phil Aker, a spokesman for the Los Angeles Transportation
Department. Los Angeles is one of the nine cities that, along with
the county, comprise the joint powers authority spearheading the
Valley system.</TE>
<TE>   "If you look at the numbers we're looking at today . . . to me,
that's almost a deal-breaker," Aker said.</TE>
<TE>   Proponents of a Valley network say they don't trust the latest
fiscal analysis because the MTA paid for it, and the findings do not
take into account potential savings from a smaller agency's lower
overhead.</TE>
<TE>   "We've seen numbers change," said Los Angeles City Council
President Alex Padilla, vice chairman of the joint powers authority.
"Our confidence in the numbers continues to be a struggle."</TE>
<TE>   Valley independence advocates have criticized Snoble's plan as
lacking specifics and promising little change from the status quo.
The Snoble proposal is also aimed at a breakaway drive in the west
San Gabriel Valley, whose leaders have formed a loose alliance with
advocates of a San Fernando Valley network.</TE>
<TE>   The MTA board is expected to vote on at least part of the sector
plan in May. If approved, the San Gabriel and San Fernando valley
sectors will become operational July 1.</TE>
<TE>   Supporters of a Valley system might still be able to claim a
victory if the board opts for Snoble's alternative, as long as their
bid for a divorce compels the MTA to decentralize.</TE>
<TE>   David Fleming, who chairs a Valley committee that is reviewing
Snoble's plan, said independence backers might even end up supporting
the sectors, if the MTA grants them meaningful control over bus
service.</TE>
<TE>   "We're going to sit down with [MTA executives] and see if we can
come up with a [sector] system that would give the Valley autonomy,"
Fleming said.</TE>

<HD>Separate Valley Bus System Plan Is Losing Steam</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>A push for a breakaway bus system in the San Fernando Valley is
losing momentum to a proposal that would give communities more local
control within the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, officials
say.</LD>
<LD>   MTA board members say it is increasingly uncertain that an
independent Valley system could pay for itself. That has strengthened
the prospects of MTA Chief Executive Roger Snoble's plan to
decentralize the agency into five semiautonomous sectors, including a
Valley one.</LD>
<LD>   "I think the sector concept is going to be the winner," said
Lancaster Mayor Frank C. Roberts, who sits on the MTA board and in
the past has backed a Valley split.</LD>
<TE>   Supporters of a Valley system have not given up the fight. But the
13-member MTA board must approve Valley independence, and agency
insiders say that appears less and less likely.</TE>
<TE>   A joint powers authority plans to formally petition the MTA within
60 days for a Valley divorce. An independent Valley transit network
would be entirely free of the MTA, with its own board and budget.</TE>

<LD>The United Way's annual fund-raising campaign is on track to meet or
even surpass a $5-million target in Ventura County, despite early
concerns that donations to Sept. 11 relief efforts would fetter local
contributions.</LD>
<LD>   The agency has received about $2.5 million in pledges and
donations from companies and individuals throughout the county since
the campaign was launched Sept. 27, said Tina Dahlenburg, campaign
chairwoman of United Way of Ventura County. The campaign ends June
30.</LD>
<LD>   "We did see a bit of a downtrend in terms of the giving here,"
Dahlenburg said, "but we're optimistic about not only hitting our
target but exceeding that $5-million number for this [year's
campaign]."</LD>
<TE>   In the aftermath of Sept. 11, the agency collected $40,000 from
local donors wanting to help relief efforts in New York. But United
Way workers reminded local residents of charities closer to home.</TE>
<TE>   "There was absolutely a sense of urgency to communicate to the
community leaders and business owners there are needs in Ventura
County that need the attention of the leaders in the community,"
Dahlenburg said.</TE>
<TE>   Several company campaigns are nearing completion, while others are
just getting underway.</TE>
<TE>   About 500 companies are participating in United Way's local drive,
according to the agency.</TE>

<HD>Seal Beach, Surf City Facing Busy Ballots</HD>
<DH>Election: Voters have a lot of decisions to make on charter
changes, council seats and infrastructure issues.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STANLEY ALLISON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Seal Beach voters will have a full menu in the voting booth March 5:
10 ballot measures and three council seats to fill. And in
neighboring Huntington Beach, voters will decide five ballot measures
that could have major effects on the city's infrastructure and
finances.</LD>
<LD>   Voters in Seal Beach will be asked to bring the City Charter more
in line with the state Constitution on issues such as open meetings,
residency requirements for city officials and gender references.</LD>
<LD>   Said City Manager John B. Bahorski: "The city manager, for
example: Under powers and duties, the charter says he shall be
responsible to the City Council. If I was a female city manager, I
might be offended by that."</LD>
<TE>   A more meaty charter change would allow the city manager to
approve public works contracts up to $20,000 without having to put
them out to bid. The limit now is $5,000, "but that's in 1964
dollars," Bahorski said. Each public works project over $20,000 would
require a bidding process, which can add $1,000 to $5,000 to the
project's cost, depending on the scope of the job. It also takes
longer for minor projects to get underway, he said.</TE>
<TE>   The only fiscal effect of the charter revisions would be potential
savings by increasing the limit on bid amounts, though Bahorski said
he couldn't project how much.</TE>
<TE>   On the council, members Paul Yost and William Doane are running
unopposed for reelection. Councilman Shawn Boyd, the target of an
investigation by the Orange County district attorney's office into
possible conflict-of-interest violations, has three challengers.</TE>
<TE>   In Huntington Beach, Measure FF asks voters to create an
"infrastructure fund" of at least 15% of the city's general fund. The
general fund is $140 million this year, so that percentage would be
$21 million.</TE>
<TE>   A 60-member advisory committee had declared infrastructure
improvements a priority for the beach city.</TE>
<TE>   Requiring an annual commitment of at least 15% would ensure that
those improvements are made, said Ray Silver, city administrator.
Amending the charter would prevent future councils from lowering that
amount, he said. "We're making a significant commitment, in good
times and bad times, to make sure we're taking care of business,"
Silver said.</TE>
<TE>   The measure would also create an advisory oversight board to
review and audit the fund.</TE>
<TE>   Measure HH would make the AES power plant in the city pay an
estimated $2.3 million a year in municipal utility taxes. Measure GG
asks if that money should be used for an infrastructure fund.</TE>
<TE>   Huntington Beach voters are also being asked to decide an
anti-rent control measure for mobile home parks, apartments and
single-family homes. Measure EE would let only property owners decide
rates, preempting a possible move toward rent control in the city's
18 mobile home parks.</TE>
<TE>   Residents of those parks have complained in recent years about
rising rents, asking Huntington Beach to consider passing a measure
that would tie rent increases at the parks to the Consumer Price
Index.</TE>
<TE>   Measure DD is a $30-million school bond measure to repair
buildings, replace roofs and heating and ventilation systems, and
qualify the school district to receive $16.7 million in state
matching funds.</TE>
<TE>Ballot Measures</TE>
<TE>Voters in Huntington Beach and Seal Beach will decide on these
measures next month:</TE>
<TE>HUNTINGTON BEACH CITY SCHOOL DISTRICT</TE>
<TE>* Measure DD--$30-million bond issue for construction and
improvements</TE>
<TE>CITY OF HUNTINGTON BEACH</TE>
<TE>* Measure EE--Prohibits the city from regulating price or terms of
sale or lease of private property</TE>
<TE>* Measure FF--Requires that 15% of General Fund expenditures be used
for infrastructure</TE>
<TE>* Measure GG--Advisory vote on how the utility tax is used</TE>
<TE>* Measure HH--Reinstates the gas tax on electric power plants</TE>
<TE>CITY OF SEAL BEACH</TE>
<TE>* Measure KK--Provides that residency requirements for elected
officials and the city manager shall be governed by state law</TE>
<TE>* Measure LL--Meetings of the City Council and appointive
boards/commissions shall be held in accordance with state law (the
Brown Act)</TE>
<TE>* Measure MM--Removes limitations on the ability of the city to
enforce its ordinances</TE>
<TE>* Measure NN--Increases the penalty for violations of the Charter
from $500 to $1,000</TE>
<TE>* Measure OO--Prohibited financial interests in city contracts shall
be governed by state law</TE>
<TE>* Measure PP--A two-year budget may be prepared upon the
determination of the city manager</TE>
<TE>* Measure QQ--Public works contracts less than $20,000 (as adjusted
annually for inflation) do not require a public bid process</TE>
<TE>* Measure RR--The City Council may enter into ''design-build'' public
works contracts</TE>
<TE>* Measure SS--Eliminates all gender-based designations, such as
''he'' and ''his,'' in the City Charter</TE>
<TE>* Measure TT--Disciplinary suspensions shall accord with progressive
discipline standards of practice</TE>

<HD>Hahn: L.A. Will Have NFL Team Within Five Years</HD>
<DH>Pro Football: Mayor commits to project after meeting with
Tagliabue before Super Bowl.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SAM FARMER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NEW ORLEANS</DL>
<LD>Los Angeles Mayor James Hahn, in town for the Super Bowl, said he
believes L.A. will have an NFL team within five years.</LD>
<LD>   "I don't think that's unrealistic," he said Sunday morning after a
45-minute meeting with NFL Commissioner Paul Tagliabue. "If we're
going to do it, we need to do it in that time frame."</LD>
<LD>   Hahn and Tagliabue, who met for the first time this weekend,
discussed bringing the NFL back to the Los Angeles area for the first
time since the Raiders and Rams left in 1995.</LD>
<TE>   Hahn said he plans to be the point man on the project.</TE>
<TE>   "It may not be on the front burner yet, but it's not on [the
NFL's] front burner yet either," he said. "We're looking at the
beginning of the process. They're committed to getting it done. And
I'm committed to getting it done."</TE>
<TE>   In a news conference Friday, Tagliabue was asked about the
league's interest in returning to L.A., and said, "We want to leave
no stone unturned to respond to that interest in the NFL in Los
Angeles."</TE>
<TE>   Hahn said he and Tagliabue did not discuss specific teams that
might move--the 32-team league has no plans to expand-- nor did they
weigh the merits of potential stadium sites. Hahn is adamant, though,
that the stadium should be located in the immediate L.A. area.</TE>
<TE>   In the past, Hahn has supported revamping the Coliseum, even
though NFL sources say that does not appeal to the league.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't want to lock into, 'You have to play at the Coliseum or
we don't want you,'" Hahn said. "I'm open to the possibility of a
stadium somewhere else."</TE>
<TE>   Hahn planned to watch the Super Bowl with members of his staff and
Roger Goodell, the NFL's chief operating officer who oversees
franchise and stadium issues.</TE>
<TE>   Beyond the obvious, the real benefit of bringing an NFL team to
L.A. is the opportunity to play host to Super Bowls--the league's
ultimate bargaining chip--which pump an estimated $350 million into
local economies. L.A. would have landed a Super Bowl every three
years had it beaten out Houston for the 32nd franchise.</TE>
<TE>   Super Bowl sites have been determined through 2006, when the game
will be played at Ford Field in Detroit. Tagliabue has said the game
might be played in New York and/or Washington after that as part of
the relief efforts.</TE>
<TE>   "We have a bigger number of cities and states competing for Super
Bowls," Tagliabue said. "And the idea that there would be a limited
number of Super Bowl locations, focusing perhaps on Miami, New
Orleans, and Southern California, I think it's passe."</TE>
<TE>   Before L.A. talks teams and stadiums, Hahn wants the NFL to
further enhance its image in Southern California by putting more
emphasis on youth programs in the area. That could help spark
interest in a generation that has little or no memory of the NFL in
L.A.</TE>
<TE>   Even in the face of growing apathy about whether the NFL returns
to the area, Hahn said there would be ample support for one.</TE>
<TE>   "Obviously we don't wither and die without a team," he said. "But
I still think we want one. All those couch potatoes watching on the
tube, even if it's on a big screen, they'd like to have the
opportunity to come to a stadium and watch it live."</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Scoring: St. Louis 3, New England 0: Jeff Wilkins, 50-yard field goal
at 3:15.</LD>
<LD>   Impact player: Ty Law led the Patriots with three tackles. The
Rams had the ball for almost 10 minutes in the quarter, but were kept
out of the end zone because the Patriot defense was outstanding. They
showed the Rams different looks on almost every play, and when Ram
receivers made a catch, they were hit hard by several Patriot
defenders. Ten Patriots made tackles in the first quarter, and Ram
quarterback Kurt Warner was sacked once.</LD>
<LD>   Missed opportunity: It was a quarter of missed opportunities for
the Rams. Warner was eight of 11 for 72 yards and the Rams had five
first downs, but put only three points on the scoreboard. So much for
that fast start everyone was expecting. The Rams gunned their motor,
but were stuck in the mud.</LD>
<TE>   Did you notice? Wanted: Marshall Faulk, last seen playing for the
Rams--5 feet 10, 211. Best running back in the game. He hardly
touched the ball in the first quarter. When the Rams beat the Eagles
in the NFC championship game, they did it by establishing their
running game. They kept giving Faulk the ball, and it opened passing
lanes for Warner. Coach Mike Martz seemed to forget that. Faulk
carried six times for 22 yards in the quarter, but three of those
carries came in the final two minutes.</TE>
<TE>   Best number: Patriot punter Ken Walter forced the Rams to start
their drives deep in their territory by averaging 52.5 yards on his
two punts. Punters are often overlooked, but Walter was one key to
the Rams scoring only three points.</TE>
<TE>   Worst number: How many of those annoying "mlife" commercials are
they going to run? In the first quarter alone, I counted 1,312 of
them. Please make them stop.</TE>

<LD>   New England 20, St. Louis 17: Vinatieri, 48-yard field goal at
0:00.</LD>
<TE>   Impact player: Adam Vinatieri has nerves of steel. He calmly
strolled onto the field and kicked the game-winning field goal as if
it was something he did every day for the last 20 years. Of course,
there wasn't a howling wind and it wasn't snowing as it was against
the Oakland Raiders, so maybe the kick seemed easy in comparison. The
Patriots showed they belonged in this game no matter what Al Davis
says.</TE>
<TE>   Missed opportunity: The fourth quarter was about as good as
football gets, more than making up for a crummy first three quarters.
Both teams played well, and you can't really find anything to fault.
If anything, the biggest missed opportunity was by the people who
voted Brady the game's most valuable player. It should have gone to
Vinatieri. Think kickers aren't athletes? How many of you who think
that could have made that kick? Put your hand down, Scott Norwood.</TE>
<TE>   Best number: Guess which team had 26 first downs and which had 15?
Guess which team had 427 total yards and which had 267? Which team
passed for 337 yards, and which for 134? If you said Rams, Patriots,
Rams, Patriots, Rams, Patriots, you win. How did the Patriots win?
That brings us to ...</TE>
<TE>   Worst number: The Rams turned over the ball three times, leading
to 17 points for the Patriots.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>RAM PASS OFFENSE VS. PATRIOT PASS DEFENSE</LD>
<LD>   Although Kurt Warner threw for 365 yards, his two interceptions
led to 10 points for the Patriots. The hard-hitting New England
secondary caused a third turnover when Antwan Harris jarred the ball
loose with a hit on Ricky Proehl, giving the Patriots the ball deep
in St. Louis territory. The Patriots disrupted Warner's timing by
alternately blitzing him or dropping seven men into the secondary,
which led to two drive-ending coverage sacks. Warner went deep only
twice.</LD>
<LD>   RAM RUN OFFENSE VS. PATRIOT RUN DEFENSE</LD>
<TE>   The Patriots held Marshall Faulk to 76 yards in 17 carries. The
Rams' most dangerous weapon never had the opportunity to break the
game open as his longest run went for only 15 yards. St. Louis had
six of its drives enter New England territory and came up empty.</TE>
<TE>   PATRIOT PASS OFFENSE VS. RAM PASS DEFENSE</TE>
<TE>   Tom Brady was content to take the routes underneath and only went
deep once, overthrowing David Patten on a sideline route. Patten
would only see one more pass, but he made it count, beating Dexter
McLeon to snare Brady's pass in the end zone and give the Patriots a
14-3 lead. Troy Brown found enough room in the coverage to grab six
passes for 89 yards, with 23 of the yards coming with 29 seconds to
play, putting the Patriots into range for Adam Vinitieri's
game-winning field goal.</TE>
<TE>   PATRIOT RUN OFFENSE VS. RAM RUN DEFENSE</TE>
<TE>   Antowain Smith found most of his running room off tackle, as the
Patriots attacked the Ram gap defense with brute force. Smith was the
Patriots' most effective weapon, finishing with 92 yards. By
establishing the run, the Patriots minized the impact of the Rams'
defensive playmakers Aeneas Williams, London Fletcher and Grant
Wistrom.</TE>
<TE>   SPECIAL TEAMS</TE>
<TE>   Although Brady drove away with the shiny new SUV along with the
MVP trophy, Vinitieri deserved the award the most. In addition to
kicking two clutch field goals, Vinitieri pinned the Rams on their
six-yard line just before the half with a perfect kickoff that angled
toward the right sideline. In the first half, the Rams' Jeff Wilkins
missed a 52-yard attempt after nailing a 50-yard try. While the miss
was not the game's turning point, it proved to be the margin of loss
for St. Louis.</TE>
<TE>   COACHING</TE>
<TE>   Bill Belichick turned in what perhaps will be considered the
greatest coaching in Super Bowl history. The bend-but-don't-break
defensive scheme worked to perfection, as the Patriots repeatedly
surrendered 30 to 40 yards, only to cause a turnover or force a punt.
The Rams' three turnovers, combined with Coach Mike Martz's failure
to make the proper adjustments, led to St. Louis' demise.</TE>
<TE>   THE BOTTOM LINE</TE>
<TE>   Before the game, St. Louis had just about everything in its favor,
or so it appeared on paper. None of the Rams' big playmakers, Faulk,
Warner, Holt or Bruce, did anything to turn the game around when the
Rams needed a spark. Where was the "Greatest Show on Earth?" Where
were the supposed mismatches because of the Rams' superior speed and
skill?</TE>

<TE>   SUPER BOWL</TE>
<TE>   Brady, playing on a sprained ankle suffered in the AFC
championship game, had modest Super Bowl passing statistics. However,
he didn't throw an interception, completed passes to seven receivers
and was at his best when it counted the most--the nine-play, 53-yard
drive that started with 1:21 left and set up Adam Vinatieri's
game-winning 48-yard field goal.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   2001 SEASON</TE>
<TE>   Brady was third string and threw only three passes in 2000, but
became the starter after Drew Bledsoe suffered internal bleeding from
a hit by the New York Jets' Mo Lewis in Week 2. Brady remained the
starter even after Bledsoe was cleared to play and led New England to
six consecutive victories to close out the regular season and an 11-5
record that netted the AFC East championship. While best remembered
for the play that officials ruled his apparent fumble an incomplete
pass late in the fourth quarter of a divisional playoff game with the
Oakland Raiders, Brady led two drives in the snow that resulted in
game-tying and game-winning field goals by Vinatieri.</TE>

<HD>Brady There When Belichick Finally Needs Him</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BOB OATES</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL>NEW ORLEANS</DL>
<LD>What won this game was the last thing anyone would have expected.</LD>
<LD>   Paced by an old Michigan quarterback--young Tom Brady--the New
England Patriots' offensive team went on a tear in the last two
minutes.</LD>
<LD>   And that, skeptics, is how they upset the St. Louis Rams on
Sunday, 20-17--with Brady's five perfectly thrown passes to place New
England for the deciding field goal.</LD>
<TE>   Everyone knows that the New England coach, Bill Belichick, is a
master of defense, and, for three quarters, his defensive players
beat back everything that Ram quarterback Kurt Warner threw at them.</TE>
<TE>   And not only that. They made the two tough, artistic defensive
plays--earning an interception and then earning a fumble--that put
the Patriots ahead, 17-3, entering what so unexpectedly turned out to
be the greatest fourth quarter in Super Bowl history.</TE>
<TE>   For when the Patriot defense finally tired--predictably, because
you can't chase that fleet of fleet Ram receivers forever--Ram Coach
Mike Martz and his quarterback, Warner, stepped in with two long
touchdown drives to tie it, 17-17.</TE>
<TE>   Now only a little over a minute remained. The first Super Bowl
overtime was just around the corner. The Patriots easily could have
elected to run out the clock, taking their chances on winning the
toss and winning in overtime.</TE>
<TE>   Brady saw it another way.</TE>
<TE>   When Charlie Weis, New England's offensive coordinator, decided to
test the Rams with a safe pass or two, Brady made the most of his
chance with two darts that moved New England from its 17-yard line to
the 30.</TE>
<TE>   Now with only 41 seconds remaining, Brady could spike the ball,
which encouraged the Patriots to carry on with the three passes that
won it.</TE>
<TE>   His last big one was dispatched to his best receiver, Troy Brown,
on the 23-yard play that killed the Rams.</TE>
<TE>   Brady followed that with another six-yard pass play, then spiked
the ball, setting the Patriots up for a 48-yard field goal, well
within Adam Vinatieri's range.</TE>
<TE>   Belichick is a famous conservative who, if he weren't so
conservative, seemingly could have won this game with ease--quite
possibly by a rout-size score--if he hadn't kept Brady under cover so
long.</TE>
<TE>   You hardly saw him in the first three quarters except for the
touchdown throw that opened New England's 17-3 halftime lead.</TE>
<TE>   But in the fourth quarter, Belichick finally reacted as if he had
no choice but to let Brady fire away. And fire the kid did, throwing
one ideal pass after another with the clear-headedness and calm he
used to exhibit, no doubt, on the Michigan practice field when no
coach was looking.</TE>
<TE>   For, now, it's hard to believe that this guy never won the Heisman
Trophy.</TE>
<TE>   It's even harder to believe that Warner was the NFL's MVP this
season, simply because the Patriots saw no point in unveiling Brady
until the last 10 minutes of a Super Bowl.</TE>
<TE>   When Belichick finally let it all hang out, you saw a man who has
to be--except for Warner--the most amazing young quarterback to come
into the league since long before Warner.</TE>
<TE>   At 6 feet 4 and 220 pounds, Brady, who is from San Mateo, clearly
has everything a good quarterback needs.</TE>
<TE>   A good veteran quarterback, that is.</TE>
<TE>   At age 24, in only his second year of NFL football, he was as cool
and skillful in the fourth quarter of high-pressure Super Bowl XXXVI
as the most seasoned quarterback you ever saw in any fourth quarter.</TE>
<TE>   What's more, when Brady had to throw a hard ball, he threw it
very, very hard, with no loss of accuracy.</TE>
<TE>   One more thing: As quarterbacks, he and Warner couldn't be more
different.</TE>
<TE>   Warner is a magician-type.</TE>
<TE>   Brady is a typical great quarterback-type, with the quick feet,
the quick arm and the rapid, smooth throwing motion of the master
passer of so long ago, Joe Namath.</TE>
<TE>   It's the irony of the season: When the Rams finally lose after a
season as the finest passing team ever--as the only football team
that ever exceeded 500 points three years running--they finally lose
to a great passer.</TE>
<TE>   A great one that nobody knew about.</TE>
<TE>   Belichick is such an exceptional defensive coach that when the
Patriots were winning eight in a row--when they were winning every
game, in fact, since the Rams beat them Nov. 18 at Foxboro,
24-17--everyone understood that Belichick was doing it with defense.</TE>
<TE>   For three quarters, he confirmed that.</TE>
<TE>   In the fourth quarter, a Michigan man saved him.</TE>

<HD>Simply Stated, Fox Making a Bad Call Axing Summerall</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Mike Penner</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>After taking 81/2 hours to say what could have been said in five
seconds ("The Super Bowl kicks off at 3:30"), after spending four
more hours tip-toeing around the three words that needed to be said
("The Rams stink"), after watching Jimmy Kimmel waste millions of
dollars of Fox's money (he wasn't the only one), after horrifying us
with the sight of Terry Bradshaw and Paul McCartney crooning a "A
Hard Day's Night" together (good thing George and John weren't around
to see it), after an endless procession of instant polls and
over-hyped commercials and self-indulgent special effects, Fox and
the Rams and the Patriots finally got to the heart of the matter in
Sunday's Super Bowl:</LD>
<LD>   This was Pat Summerall's last game as No. 1 play-by-play
broadcaster for Fox, and this is why Fox will miss him more than it
will ever realize.</LD>
<LD>   "This would be from 48 yards," Summerall simply, calmly intoned as
New England's Adam Vinatieri readied for the potential game-winning
field goal.</LD>
<TE>   John Madden, Summerall's broadcast partner for the last 21 years,
was overflowing with enough enthusiasm for the both of them, as has
been the norm for the last 21 years.</TE>
<TE>   "This has been a year about Vinatieri and making some great kicks
against the Raiders--two of the greatest kicks that I have seen in my
life," Madden declared, about to splutter over the top.</TE>
<TE>   Luckily, Summerall was at his side, playing free safety.</TE>
<TE>   "Here comes one of greater importance--if he makes it," Summerall
said, succinctly and accurately.</TE>
<TE>   Vinatieri drove his right foot into the ball.</TE>
<TE>   Summerall, an old field-goal kicker with the New York Giants, knew
it as soon as he hit it.</TE>
<TE>   "And it's right down the pipe."</TE>
<TE>   Summerall took a deep breath, allowing the nation to do the same.</TE>
<TE>   The 14-point underdog Patriots had just defeated the supposedly
invincible St. Louis Rams. Their actions--Ty Law returning a Kurt
Warner interception for a touchdown, second-year pro Tom Brady coolly
directing a last-second drive, Vinatieri putting his head down and
going to work--spoke louder than any amount of words ever could.</TE>
<TE>   Summerall realized it, and he might be the only one at Fox who
did. He paused for six long seconds, drawing out the drama, letting
the roar of the Superdome crowd supply the soundtrack while Patriot
center Lonie Paxton laid down on the artificial grass and, mimicking
the team's post-overtime snow angels against the Raiders, began
cranking out turf angels.</TE>
<TE>   Six seconds of broadcasting bliss, interrupted only--of course--by
another annoying laser-beam sound effect as the graphic next to "NE"
flashed from a black 17 to a glowing red 20.</TE>
<TE>   Summerall finally returned, marking the moment for posterity:</TE>
<TE>   "Adam Vin-a-ti-er-i.</TE>
<TE>   "No time on the clock.</TE>
<TE>   "And the Patriots have won Super Bowl 36.</TE>
<TE>   "Unbelievable."</TE>
<TE>   And Fox is showing Summerall the door because he's 71 and
understated--at Fox, that's a felony--and this network is hip, you
see, and can't bother with old school when it has a new episode of
"Boston Public" to hawk.</TE>
<TE>   Fox just doesn't get it, but what can you expect from a network
that thinks "on-air chemistry" is having Bradshaw act like a buffoon
while Cris Collinsworth eggs him on and Howie Long chortles in the
background.</TE>
<TE>   "That's the way you should win a Super Bowl," Madden said as red,
white and blue confetti shot from sideline air cannons.</TE>
<TE>   "Man, alive!" Summerall exclaimed, settling back in his chair,
taking it all in.</TE>
<TE>   "They came in here against all odds," Madden said. "They were
backed up. They had no timeouts. And they drove the ball and got into
field-goal position. That was a great, great drive."</TE>
<TE>   And one Madden had argued against from the time it started, with
the score tied, 17-17, 1:21 on the clock and the Patriots with the
ball on their 17 with no timeouts.</TE>
<TE>   "You have to just run the clock out, you have to play for overtime
now," Madden said as Brady lined up from the first play of the last
drive. "I don't think you want to force anything here. You don't want
to do anything stupid. Because you have no timeouts left and you're
backed up."</TE>
<TE>   But Brady wasn't taking the snap and taking a knee. He was in the
shotgun formation, passing downfield, again and again.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't agree with what the Patriots are doing right here,"
Madden said. "I would play for overtime."</TE>
<TE>   The Patriots might have been two-touchdown underdogs, but their
victory was only the second biggest upset of Super Bowl Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   The first: Madden revealing himself to be more of a football
conservative than Bill Belichick.</TE>
<TE>   Madden gave Belichick his due afterward, sheepishly admitting that
"I was on record saying I don't think they should have done it....
They let it all hang out when they had to let it all hang out. And,
doggone it, more power to them!"</TE>
<TE>   Summerall, feeling for his old friend, graciously offered an
assist.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought that's what they were going to do as well," he told
Madden. "You weren't alone. I thought that's what they'd do--send it
into overtime."</TE>
<TE>   A few minutes later, after the trophy presentation and a few quick
player interviews and a video-montage tribute to Summerall that left
Madden choked up, Summerall eloquently provided support again.</TE>
<TE>   "Well, they can take me from here, standing next to you, which is
going to happen," Summerall told Madden. "But one thing they can't
take is my feeling for you, the friendship we developed. We've been a
team and I'm proud of that fact. We've been a winning team."</TE>
<TE>   The best in the NFL, for more than two decades. And now, against
the wishes of both men, they're breaking it up. In the television
business, they call it progress.</TE>

<DL>NEW ORLEANS</DL>
<LD>On an untiring, unimaginable, appropriate evening, the Super Bowl
champions weren't a football team.</LD>
<LD>   They were a flag.</LD>
<LD>   A single mass of red, white and blue unfurling across the
Superdome floor.</LD>
<TE>   Flapping, clanking, rattling, twisting, then flapping again.</TE>
<TE>   So much strength from a cloth so thin. So much surprise from an
ideal so old.</TE>
<TE>   Today it is not just the New England Patriots who fly, but so,
too, the belief that sports is all about fabric.</TE>
<TE>   High they wave, as high above the St. Louis Rams as Adam
Vinatieri's 48-yard field goal in the final seconds that gave the
Patriots a 20-17 victory Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   Afterward, hidden at midfield underneath a blanket of confetti,
they danced like Buster Douglas once danced, whooped like Villanova
once whooped, and it's OK if you were howling with them.</TE>
<TE>   This was not only the biggest upset in the 36 years of Super Bowl
history, with the best finish in Super Bowl history, but all of it
happened with the most timely backdrop.</TE>
<TE>   From the pregame songs of John Phillip Sousa to the halftime
unveiling of the names of those killed in the Sept. 11 tragedy, the
theme of this game was the resilience of a unified America.</TE>
<TE>   The Patriots became that theme.</TE>
<TE>   Three colors. One cloth. This, from the time they took the field
during the pregame introductions, all together, refusing to be
introduced separately, another Super Bowl first.</TE>
<TE>   The Rams danced to the field separately. The Patriots rolled out
together. The game turned before the opening kickoff.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm sure the TV networks didn't like it, I'm sure the league is
going to fine us, but I don't care," said cornerback Ty Law.</TE>
<TE>   "We weren't going to come hopping and shaking out there as
individuals. We were going to show everyone we were in this
together."</TE>
<TE>   Together, through a game-long series of hits that pounded the Rams
into stripes, backed by a strategy that made Coach Mike Martz see
stars.</TE>
<TE>   Together, through a 14-point lead, then a 14-point blown lead, on
toward what was certainly going to be the first overtime in Super
Bowl history.</TE>
<TE>   But together, finally, while holding the ball on their own 17-yard
line with 1:21 remaining and no timeouts.</TE>
<TE>   Drew Bledsoe, the Patriot quarterback who lost his job to young
Tom Brady yet never complained, grabbed the kid as he was leaving the
sidelines for the huddle.</TE>
<TE>   "Drop back and sling it," he told Brady.</TE>
<TE>   "Go win the game."</TE>
<TE>   Few thought Brady, who had only 92 passing yards before than
drive, would actually follow that advice. Most thought the Patriots
would play it safe, avoid a turnover, and take their chances in
overtime.</TE>
<TE>   But then again, most thought the Patriots would lose by two
touchdowns.</TE>
<TE>   "Why not go for it?" asked Brady afterward.</TE>
<TE>   "With that much time left, why not? You never know. And this is
evidence."</TE>
<TE>   Evidence, indeed.</TE>
<TE>   A nine-play drive that turned the 199th player selected in the
2000 draft into a Super Bowl MVP.</TE>
<TE>   A drive that ended with the making of a New England hero who,
right this minute, is bigger than Carlton Fisk.</TE>
<TE>   So, Adam Vinatieri, were you praying?</TE>
<TE>   "I've been praying all day," he said with a grin.</TE>
<TE>   As for Ram quarterback Kurt Warner, even in defeat, his biblical
references remained consistent.</TE>
<TE>   "It says in there, 'When the winds and rain come,''' he said,
shaking his head. "There's no if (. It's a when ."</TE>
<TE>   This latest storm will surely shake the NFL in the same manner as
the Baltimore Ravens championship last season.</TE>
<TE>   A team can win the battle of total net yards, 427-267, and lose
the game?</TE>
<TE>   A team can have 11 more first downs, hold the ball for seven more
minutes, and lose the game?</TE>
<TE>   If that team gets outhit, it can. If that team gets outschemed, it
can.</TE>
<TE>   The Patriots proved for a second consecutive season that the best
team is not the most talented team, but the most together team.</TE>
<TE>   Talk about your well-timed public-service announcements.</TE>
<TE>   "I hated it this year when people called us a team of destiny,
because that implied luck," Vinatieri said. "But then you look at all
that happened to our country, and all the patriotic stuff before
today's game, and you look at our name and our attitude ... and you
say, maybe something up there is helping us out."</TE>
<TE>   Remember, this is the team that, in the second round of the
playoffs, defeated the Oakland Raiders only because a replay official
changed a Brady fumble call in the final moments.</TE>
<TE>   This is the team that, in the AFC championship, defeated the
Pittsburgh Steelers only after their quarterback, Kordell Stewart,
threw two horrible passes on their two final drives.</TE>
<TE>   This is a team that, even if the point spread wasn't as great,
began this game as bigger underdogs than the New York Jets in Super
Bowl III.</TE>
<TE>   The Jets were 18-point underdogs because, being from the renegade
American Football League, few folks knew of their great talent.</TE>
<TE>   The Patriots were 14-point underdogs because they simply weren't
as good as the Rams.</TE>
<TE>   "If we're playing next week, we'd probably be the underdogs,"
Coach Bill Belichick said.</TE>
<TE>   They took the field a couple of hours before the game, bumping
heads and pounding pads, determined to get into the sort of hitting
mood that would swing the odds.</TE>
<TE>   Then the NFL shooed them off for a show that featured taped
speeches from past presidents, the Boston Pops, and emotional
renderings of America the Beautiful and the National Anthem.</TE>
<TE>   It was arguably the most compelling pregame display in American
sports history.</TE>
<TE>   And it drove the Patriots bonkers.</TE>
<TE>   "I hope you enjoyed it, because we hated it," Brady said. "We were
ready to play, but we had to go back and sit in our locker room for
an hour."</TE>
<TE>   Yet it worked for everyone. When the game started, the Patriots
were more restless than ever. And the 72,922 fans in the Superdome
had decided upon their favorite team.</TE>
<TE>   On the second play of the game, the Rams' Torry Holt made an
18-yard catch, but the Patriots' Tebucky Jones hit him so hard, one
could probably hear it while retching on Bourbon Street. The crowd
roared.</TE>
<TE>   Moments later, Holt was bumped by Law on a long ball that he
couldn't catch. The crowd roared again.</TE>
<TE>   "We heard all this talk about how they were track stars, but it's
hard to run an 100-yard dash with somebody standing in your way," Law
said. "We wanted to hit them, and keep hitting them."</TE>
<TE>   Law's 47-yard interception return for a touchdown came after Mike
Vrabel smacked Warner with a right jab.</TE>
<TE>   The Patriots second touchdown came after Ricky Proehl fumbled when
he was smacked in the chest by Antwan Harris.</TE>
<TE>   The Patriots first field goal came after an interception caused
when Holt was shoved away by Otis Smith.</TE>
<TE>   "Yeah, they were tough," Warner said. "Real tough."</TE>
<TE>   The Patriots preferred a different word.</TE>
<TE>   "Patriots," owner Bob Kraft said. "Today, we're all Patriots."</TE>
<TE>   Aren't we ever.</TE>

<LD>Scoring: New England 7, St. Louis 3: Ty Law, 47-yard interception
return at 8:49. PAT--Adam Vinatieri (kick).</LD>
<LD>   New England 14, St. Louis 3: David Patten, eight-yard reception
from Tom Brady at 0:31. PAT--Vinatieri (kick).</LD>
<LD>   Impact player: Again, Law and the Patriot defense. They forced two
turnovers, Law returning one for a touchdown. The Rams looked like
the team that didn't belong in the game as the Patriots shut down the
offense with little problem.</LD>
<TE>   Missed opportunity: The Rams still couldn't put the ball in the
end zone. They seemed to panic on offense, as if they were just
throwing every play they had against the wall, hoping something would
stick. Nothing did. The Patriots refused to be introduced
individually before the game, wanting to come out as a team, and they
went into halftime as the best team.</TE>
<TE>   Did you notice? The Patriots led, 14-3, despite a shaky
performance by Tom Brady, who played more like Cousin Oliver than a
true Brady. C'mon Fox, where are the shots of Drew Bledsoe on the
sideline, champing at the bit to get in the game? Where is the drama?
The controversy? You're Fox for goodness sake, the same network that
shows wild police videos and kids breaking their arms while
skateboarding. And you can't get us a picture of Bledsoe?</TE>
<TE>   Best number: Patriot running back Antowain Smith rushed for 41
yards in the first half, only three fewer than Marshall Faulk. New
England actually had more rushing yards in the first half, and slowly
began to dominate the game. Warner passed for 136 yards, Brady only
67, but Warner threw the only interception.</TE>
<TE>   Worst number: The Rams turned the ball over twice, and both led to
touchdowns for the Patriots.</TE>

<DL>NEW ORLEANS</DL>
<LD>The extraordinary security measures in place for Sunday's Super Bowl
seemingly left nothing to chance, as about 5,000 law enforcement
officials, some carrying M-16 rifles, patrolled the interior and
perimeter of the Superdome.</LD>
<LD>   Fans, media, pregame and halftime performers, and even the players
and coaches for the New England Patriots and St. Louis Rams were
required to go through at least three security checkpoints.</LD>
<LD>   Those were the visible signs of security for the first sporting
event to be classified as a National Special Security Event.</LD>
<TE>   Behind the scenes, it was unclear whether the NFL again used
technology that scanned the crowd to try to identify possible
fugitives or known felons. The league was criticized for using the
technology last year in Tampa, Fla., and a league spokesman was vague
on the topic Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   "We are using the most sophisticated technology available to
monitor the game, but beyond that, we're not going to comment," the
spokesman said.</TE>
<TE>   The security effort resulted in long lines to enter the Superdome,
but spectators seemed prepared. More than an hour before kickoff,
league officials announced, 95% of the crowd had cleared the
extensive security checkpoints.</TE>
<TE>   St. Louis Ram guard Adam Timmerman said, "It was probably the
safest place on earth today.</TE>
<TE>   "They told us what we could and couldn't bring, just like the
fans. I thought it was handled really professionally. And, really for
the most part, we didn't see a lot of extra things going on."</TE>
<TE>   Ticket holders were advised to arrive at least four hours early,
and many showed up even earlier, which helped them negotiate a venue
encircled by concrete barriers, and crawling with FBI and Secret
Service agents, the National Guard, and local and state police.</TE>
<TE>   Beverage coolers, foam fingers and other staples of pre-Sept. 11
games were confiscated at the gates.</TE>
<TE>   There was a no-fly zone in effect over the stadium, and truck
traffic was banned on Interstate 10, which runs past the Superdome.</TE>
<TE>   The Hyatt hotel, the league headquarters for Super Bowl week,
closed its front entrance for 24 hours, beginning at 6 a.m. Sunday.
Guests had to show room keys to use the elevators, and armed guards
patrolled most floors.</TE>
<TE>   "We will always be alert to the possibility of a terrorist event
at a high-profile event like the Super Bowl, like the Olympics,"
Homeland Security Director Tom Ridge said on NBC's "Meet the Press."</TE>
<TE>   Even more stringent measures are in place for the Olympics, which
begin this week in Utah. Still, the Super Bowl was much more than a
dress rehearsal. The event was watched on American television by 130
million last year. The game was attended by 70,000 at the Superdome.</TE>
<TE>   Milt Aldrich, who oversees security for the NFL, said, "It went
very much according to plan. No surprises. It was just as we hoped it
would be. We had a great game. We had an opportunity to focus on the
halftime, the pregame and a terrific football game, and not have to
worry about security. That's what we wanted to do."</TE>
<TE>   Aldrich said there were no major incidents. "None," he said.
"Minor, minor things, but nothing of a serious nature. Very routine.
Bumps and bruises."</TE>

report.</TE>

<LD>My Super Bowl Diary: Day 7</LD>
<LD>   NEW ORLEANS--Before we could make our way into the Superdome
Sunday to hear Paul McCartney sing about "Freedom," we were told to
arrive "at least four hours early and naked" for Super Bowl 36.</LD>
<LD>   That's no big deal for the people accustomed to spending time in
this den of iniquity, of course, because you take a walk down Bourbon
Street and you see women lifting their tops for a few beads. You see
that happen two or three hundred times a day and you no longer take
that much notice.</LD>
<TE>   But I wanted to make sure Plaschke, Pucin, Farmer and Oates--our
Times team for Super Bowl 36--understood the NFL advisory for Super
Bowl 36 was just a figure of speech, you know, to avoid any awkward
moments.</TE>
<TE>   And although I'm not allowed to write about Xxxxxx Xxxxxxxxx, I
thought about contacting the Rams with a clarification to spare her
any embarrassment, but then I decided--never mind.</TE>
<TE>   Freedom, of course, is a wonderful thing. And as long as you left
your car behind, walked to the Superdome, found an opening in the
eight-foot fence surrounding the whole area, agreed to be patted down
from head to toe and everywhere in between, emptied your pockets at a
second checkpoint and were not thrown by the number of Secret
Service, M-16-armed National Guard and police glaring at you
suspiciously, you were allowed to hand someone your $400 ticket and
buy beer in a plastic bottle. I guess that's why there were no
no-shows.</TE>
<TE>   Once in the building, it was the Super Bowl over-the-top as usual,
and I'm sure the NFL inquired about cutting a hole into each end of
the Superdome to allow a fly-by by F-16s, but apparently it was
denied.</TE>
<TE>   John Travolta opened the hoopla with a prerecorded message, which
didn't allow him the freedom to make an impromptu pitch for the
Church of Scientology.</TE>
<TE>   Barry Manilow kicked off the lip-syncing contest. And then for the
next hour--between commercials and the crowd chanting "Go Rams," and
"Go Pats"--the NFL tried to reinforce Commissioner Paul Tagliabue's
empirical claim in the $15 Super Bowl program that "nothing is more
American than the Super Bowl."</TE>
<TE>   The Rams were introduced first, and then New England came out as a
team, passing on the individual opportunity to mug for the cameras,
which means Keyshawn Johnson will never agree to play for New
England.</TE>
<TE>   THE FIRST Britney Spears' commercial came after each team had
punted, and it's a good thing they weren't waiting to air it after
the Rams had scored their first touchdown. Most people, of course,
were expecting "The Greatest Show on Turf," but instead for three
quarters got a look at the brand of Jim Everett-Dieter Brock-T.J.
Rubley football that used to be played in Anaheim.</TE>
<TE>   The Rams had played their way through the season with the
arrogance that comes with scoring more than 500 points three
consecutive years. But they also had left themselves
vulnerable--leading the league in turnovers. In their only two losses
before Sunday, they had turned the ball over 13 times--and against
jarring defenses in Tampa Bay and New Orleans. The wrecking ball
would come finally in the form of the Patriots, and three more
turnovers would ultimately be the Rams' undoing.</TE>
<TE>   "Being fast is not enough," said Patriot defender Lawyer Milloy.
"The whole game you have to hit, and they weren't up to that."</TE>
<TE>   But that's Xs and O's stuff, and really there's nothing more
appealing to Americans than rooting for the underdog, which is why
the NFL arranged it so the Patriots would beat the Raiders in the
snow, and eventually play in Super Bowl 36.</TE>
<TE>   I haven't quite figured it out yet, but I'm sure the NFL also had
a hand in the Patriots springing one of the biggest upsets in Super
Bowl history in a game dedicated to patriotism. I know this, if the
whole thing was scripted, I'm not surprised they picked a guy from
USC to fill the role of bad guy and lend a little realism to this
Cinderella story.</TE>
<TE>   If New England defender Willie McGinest didn't bear hug Marshall
Faulk and get caught for holding--something he obviously was taught
while playing for the Trojans, Tebucky Jones' 97-yard touchdown
return of a Kurt Warner fumble would have given the Patriots a 24-3
lead and probably negated the sizzling finish.</TE>
<TE>   The penalty on McGinest put the Rams in position to score a
touchdown, and I would imagine there were high-fives all around at
Fox now that everyone had to stay around and see how this one would
end.</TE>
<TE>   The Rams scored again--because the script called for it; and with
1:21 to play in a tie game, the Patriots had the ball at their own
17-yard line. John Madden was saying on Fox that New England should
run out the clock, because that would give Fox the first Super Bowl
to go into overtime and at the same time extend Pat Summerall's
career. Madden used to coach the Raiders, so if the NFL fix was in,
there's no way the league would have tipped him off.</TE>
<TE>   The rest is NFL history, the the field goal going through with two
seconds to play in regulation and the Rams not even bothering to get
the seconds put back on the clock and hang around for a kickoff
return a la Cal against Stanford--this time through the maze of
confetti and photographers. That would have been some finish.</TE>
<TE>   But it's like my new favorite singer, Paul Hewson--you know,
Bono--crooned at halftime, no matter who won this game in the end,
everyone went home safe--and it was "A Beautiful Day."</TE>

<HD>Brady's Passing Fuels Winning Drive in Final 1:21 After
Rams Tie It</HD>
<DH>Patriots, Two-Touchdown Underdogs, Win on Vinatieri Field
Goal at 0:00</DH>

<AU>SAM FARMER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NEW ORLEANS</DL>
<LD>What began two weeks ago with a whiteout in Foxboro ended Sunday with
a confetti blizzard in the Superdome.</LD>
<LD>   Somewhere in between, most of the NFL world got snowed.</LD>
<LD>   Snowed into thinking the St. Louis Rams were unbeatable. Snowed
into thinking the New England Patriots were doomed. Snowed into
thinking kicker Adam Vinatieri's 15 minutes of fame were up.</LD>
<TE>   Oh, what a mistake.</TE>
<TE>   With the game on the line and a monumental upset nearly half a
football field away, Vinatieri split the uprights with a 48-yard
field goal as time expired, lifting the Patriots to an unbelievable
20-17 victory before a crowd of 72,922.</TE>
<TE>   It marked the first NFL title for the Patriots--two-touchdown
underdogs--and the first time in Super Bowl history the winning score
came on the game's final play.</TE>
<TE>   So sure was Vinatieri his kick was good, he threw up his arms
immediately after finishing his leg swing, then gleefully wrapped his
arms around delirious holder Ken Walter.</TE>
<TE>   "When I was getting ready to kick it, [Walter] said, 'You better
come to me after you hit this thing,'" Vinatieri said. "So I ran
towards the sidelines, then I stopped and he just about tackled me."</TE>
<TE>   Vinatieri, remember, made those two clutch kicks in the snow to
beat the Raiders in a divisional playoff. Sunday's was even bigger.</TE>
<TE>   The kick punctuated a dream season for the Patriots, who went from
worst (fifth place in the AFC East last season) to cursed (losing
starting quarterback Drew Bledsoe two games into the season) to
first. Tom Brady, who rocketed to NFL stardom in Bledsoe's stead, was
named the game's most valuable player and strolled away with, of all
things, a Cadillac pickup truck.</TE>
<TE>   The past week was anything but a smooth ride for Brady, who
suffered a twisted left ankle against Pittsburgh in the AFC
championship game and didn't know if he would be the Super Bowl
starter until midweek. He wore a stiff plastic cast on his left
ankle, although he said it didn't bother him much.</TE>
<TE>   So cool was Brady before the game, he walked off the field after
warmups, stretched out on the floor in front of his locker and took a
nap. Actually fell asleep. Before the biggest game of his life.</TE>
<TE>   "Drew was [lying] right next to me," he said. "I laid down and was
looking up at the ceiling and I just fell asleep."</TE>
<TE>   His counterpart on the Rams, Kurt Warner, had a nightmarish game.
He threw two interceptions, was sacked three times and took a beating
from Patriot pass rushers. The game was the most secure in Super Bowl
history, but Warner's pocket was unbelievably porous.</TE>
<TE>   On a pivotal play in the second quarter, linebacker Mike Vrabel
charged in from the left side of the defense and plowed into Warner
just as he released the ball.</TE>
<TE>   The pass, intended for Isaac Bruce, was thrown on the wrong side
of the receiver and wound up in the hands of cornerback Ty Law, who
dashed 47 yards down the sideline for the touchdown and a 7-3 lead.</TE>
<TE>   "I got up, and I just saw Ty dancing," Vrabel said. "He was there
already."</TE>
<TE>   By halftime, New England's lead had swelled to 14-3, thanks to a
spectacular eight-yard touchdown catch by David Patten. He had to
extend his body to its fullest to make the grab, then stay inbounds
as he landed prone on the turf. Cornerback Dexter McCleon argued he
was out of bounds, but officials studied the replay and ruled it a
touchdown with 31 seconds left in the half.</TE>
<TE>   It was the first time since a 16-3 loss to Carolina more than a
year ago that St. Louis scored only three points in a half, and the
11-point deficit was the Rams' largest of the season.</TE>
<TE>   Things would get worse before they got better for St. Louis.
Vinatieri kicked a 37-yard field goal in the third quarter to put his
team up, 17-3. And Patriot safety Tebucky Jones had what appeared to
be a 97-yard return for a touchdown off a Warner fumble on fourth and
goal, but the play was brought back because linebacker Willie
McGinest held Marshall Faulk so blatantly he nearly tackled him.</TE>
<TE>   That holding call gave St. Louis a first and goal at the Patriot
one, and the Rams scored two plays later when Warner followed center
Andy McCollum into the end zone for a two-yard touchdown with 9:31 to
play.</TE>
<TE>   When St. Louis took over at its 45, trailing by a touchdown with
1:51 to play, it looked as if the Patriot fairy tale was just about
over. Warner went to work, tossing an 18-yard pass to Az-Zahir Hakim
and an 11-yarder to Yo Murphy. On the third play of the 21-second
drive, he found Ricky Proehl, and Proehl found the end zone for a
26-yard touchdown and a 17-17 tie with 1:30 left. Along the way, he
juked Jones and spun cornerback Terrance Shaw out of his socks.</TE>
<TE>   "When we made the touchdown, I said, 'We're going to win this
game,'" Proehl said. "We felt good about what we were doing in the
last couple of drives."</TE>
<TE>   But Brady is the feel-good kid, and there was no way he was going
to burn the last 1:21 to take his chances in overtime. He inched
downfield from his own 17 with three short completions to J.R.
Redmond, then picked up 23 more yards with a toss to his favorite
receiver, Troy Brown. One more completion, a six-yarder to tight end
Jermaine Wiggins, put Vinatieri in position to make history.</TE>
<TE>   Before he took the field for the final drive, Brady got some words
of encouragement from Bledsoe, with whom he has remained close
friends even as competitors.</TE>
<TE>   "I just said to him, 'Hey, sling it. Have some fun. Go win the
game,'" Bledsoe said. "He certainly did. He came through. That's what
legends are made of, you know, two-minute drive in the Super Bowl to
win the game."</TE>
<TE>   Moments later, Brady plopped down on a chair in front of his
locker, cut the tape off his heavily bandaged ankles, and happily
adjusted his newly minted championship cap.</TE>
<TE>   "Man," he said, turning to third-string quarterback Damon Huard,
"we just won the Super Bowl. The Suuuuper Bowl."</TE>
<TE>   Back on the field, the last specks of confetti were still
fluttering to the turf.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   (BEGIN TEXT OF INFOBOX)</TE>
<TE>   Deciding Drive</TE>
<TE>   After St. Louis tied the score at 17-17, New England had first and
10 at its 17-yard line with 1:21 remaining. The deciding drive:</TE>
<TE>   First and 10 on Patriot 17 (1:21)--Tom Brady passes to J.R.
Redmond for five yards. Dre' Bly and London Fletcher make the stop at
the Patriot 22.</TE>
<TE>   Second and five on Patriot 22 (0:57)--Brady passes to Redmond for
eight yards, tackled by Aeneas Williams and Tommy Polley at the 30.</TE>
<TE>   First and 10 on Patriot 30 (0:41)--Brady's pass is incomplete.</TE>
<TE>   Second and 10 on Patriot 30 (0:41)--Brady passes to Redmond for 11
yards, pushed out of bounds at the 41 by Polley and Kim Herring.</TE>
<TE>   First and 10 on Patriot 41 (0:33)--Brady's pass is incomplete.</TE>
<TE>   Second and 10 on Patriot 41 (0:29)--Brady passes to Troy Brown,
run out of bounds by Adam Archuleta at the Ram 36 after a 23-yard
gain.</TE>
<TE>   Second and 10 on Ram 36 (0:21)--Brady passes to Jermaine Wiggins
for a six-yard gain, stopped by Dexter McCleon and Leonard Little.</TE>
<TE>   Second and four on the Ram 30 (0:07)--Brady spikes ball to stop
the clock.</TE>
<TE>   Third and four on the Ram 30 (0:07)-- Lonie Paxton centers the
ball to holder Ken Walter. Adam Vinatieri kicks a 48-yard field goal
to win the Super Bowl.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   WINNING TIME</TE>
<TE>   Key plays in the final, furious minutes of Super Bowl XXXVI:</TE>
<TE>   * Kurt Warner passes 26 yards to Ricky Proehl for touchdown with
1:30 left as Rams complete rally from14-point fourth-quarter deficit.</TE>
<TE>   * Patriots get ball at their 17-yard line with 1:21 remaining.</TE>
<TE>   * Patriot quarterback Tom Brady completes two passes to J.R.
Redmond for 13 yards before he spikes ball to stop clock. With 41
seconds left, he connects with Redmond again for 11 yards before
throwing incomplete with 33 seconds left.</TE>
<TE>   * Brady passes to Troy Brown for 23 yards with 29 seconds left.</TE>
<TE>   * Brady passes to Jermaine Wiggins for six yards with 21 seconds
left. Wiggins is tackled inbounds and Brady spikes the ball with
seven seconds left.</TE>
<TE>   Adam Vinatieri kicks 48-yard field goal and time expires.</TE>

telling Bonds to give it up, to walk away, whispering: "Why hang
around just to break the all-time home-run record?" Bonds, hitting in
an empty stadium, finally has heard enough, replying: "Hank, will you
cut it out already?" Nice cut to an embarrassed-looking Aaron in the
press box, just before the requisite pitch for Charles Schwab
investment advice.</LD>
<TE>   2. This Falcon won't fumble: The beer-toting falcon delivers Bud
Light to a party on roof-top terrace. "Wow, that is so cool. Can he
do it again?" a girl asks. The falcon is shown, diving into a
sidewalk cafe, terrorizing people and bringing back his quarry, more
beer and something extra. And so ... the best Falcon to appear in a
Super Bowl.</TE>
<TE>   3. Six degrees of VISA: The popular Kevin Bacon game--who hasn't
been in a movie with him? --is played by Bacon as he attempts to
write a check and needs to show identification. The tongue-in-cheek
attitude worked with Bob Dole in his Super Bowl spot a couple of
years ago when he returned to his hometown and couldn't cash a check,
and the mild self-mocking approach holds up with Bacon.</TE>
<TE>   4. Bring on the dancing horses: There was always something about
these horses that, well, seem to cause even the most cynical scribe
to get a lump in the throat. Here, no words are needed as the
Clydesdales move through the snowy hills, woods and small towns,
eventually ending up in New York, dropping their heads in a moment of
tribute to the victims of the terrorist attacks of Sept 11.</TE>
<TE>   5. Candyland: This mixed reality and fantasy. A guest is checking
in at a swank hotel and is asked a series of questions: "Would you
like a free newspaper in the morning ... a wake-up call ... and how
about our turndown service with a complimentary chocolate on your
pillow?'' The chocolate turns out to be a red M&amp;M. The candy asks:
"Can I watch TV?" Even when you expect the unexpected with Super Bowl
ads, this one, silly and all, still hits the mark.</TE>
<TE>   6. Office of National Drug Control policy: Sharp and to the point,
showing dollar figures for various items and asking, "Where do
terrorists get their money?" The answer: "If you buy drugs, some of
it might come from you." This shows ads don't have to be humorous to
be effective.</TE>
<TE>   Thumbs Down</TE>
<TE>   1. Belly flop: Our advice--don't get a mlife. These ads struggled
to find the right tone, or any tone for that matter, during the
entire program. In particular, our least favorite about going
"wireless" featured belly buttons of an infinite variety. Luckily,
there was no jello served with our halftime snacks.</TE>
<TE>   2. Subway series: The sandwich guys had a rough Super Bowl outing.
But the Subway ad stood out with the annoying man who kept breaking
into the conversation of the other patrons at a table nearby with
chimes of "low fat." Little did they know it was Subway's weight-loss
star Jared. Bring on the extra cheese.</TE>
<TE>   3. Legs of Gumby: The music was fine, even promising. Then came
the sight of a guy and his gumby-like legs, flying out of control as
he moved across the street. Flyweight Levi's jeans, we know, but
there is a fine line between cleverness, and well, weirdness.</TE>
<TE>   4. Malcolm on the bottom: This is part of the bargain, of course.
You are going to get a huge dose of cross-promotion on Fox, and it
really was interesting for a moment or two, when Ally McBeal was
confronted by a girl, saying: "I'm your daughter." If only the
Malcolm promotions had been a little less frequent and a little less
annoying. Then again, it could have been worse. We could have seen
some more belly buttons.</TE>

<HD>Day of Reckoning for Humble Pair</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Diane Pucin</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>NEW ORLEANS</DL>
<LD>Coming from nowhere to somewhere, from Millbrook, Ala., and
Lynchburg, Va., from odd jobs to community college to Houston, from
Western Kentucky, where basketball was king, to being an NFL
defensive coordinator, standing on the turf of the Superdome and
looking up to see your teammates, your defenders, holding up the
Super Bowl trophy, it can make men positively teary-eyed.</LD>
<LD>   Humility joined with hard work. That's what shaped Antowain Smith,
New England Patriot running back, and Romeo Crennel, New England
Patriot defensive coordinator. Nothing more or less.</LD>
<LD>   Who are these guys? Just hard workers, serious professionals,
humble men who did jobs.</LD>
<TE>   As the flabbergasted Patriots celebrated their 20-17, last-second
upset of the St. Louis Rams in Super Bowl XXXVI, Smith and Crennel
walked slowly off the field, each wiping something from their eyes.
Sweat, maybe. A tear possibly.</TE>
<TE>   All week the world was treated to stories of the excellence of
Marshall Faulk, considered the best all-around player in the NFL by
many people, and to the charming tale of Ram defensive coordinator
Lovie Smith, who came to St. Louis this year to rebuild a wimpy
defense into a fearsome powerhouse. Faulk was from New Orleans. Smith
had a cool first name and the tag of hottest assistant coach,
certainly destined in the next couple of years to become a head
coach.</TE>
<TE>   Sports is a funny thing, quirky and contrary. What you expect, it
doesn't always happen. What is made out to be the best and hottest,
somebody on the other side might not pay attention to that.</TE>
<TE>   Smith and Crennel weren't on the front pages of newspapers all
week, weren't being invited to the Jackson Square sets of Fox or HBO
or ESPN or every radio station in the country, and that was OK.</TE>
<TE>   Because ultimately, in a most memorable, meaningful, magical Super
Bowl, where wearing red, white and blue wasn't corny and being a
Patriot wasn't embarrassing, Smith and Crennel were the stars who
didn't brag, the Patriots who didn't mind being ignored, the athlete
and the coach who did their jobs and believed that's what they were
supposed to do.</TE>
<TE>   Smith is the low-rent New England Patriot running back from
Millbrook, Ala., a free agent who came to New England as a cheap cog
in an expensive machine, who outgained Faulk 92 yards to 76. Smith
never fumbled, hardly ever stumbled, just bulled ahead, even after
injuring his ankle and his coaches asked if he wanted a rest.</TE>
<TE>   "No," Smith said, "I was not coming out of this game. Not ever.
Not today. Not when nobody wanted to give us any credit or any
chances. I wasn't coming out. Not after taking my road."</TE>
<TE>   The road Smith took was the road adults who accept responsibility
sometimes, but not always, take. Smith didn't play football until his
senior year of high school and then became an all-district and
all-conference running back. Smith never had much time for sports
because he worked as much as he could. "My grandparents were taking
care of me," Smith said, "and I needed to help."</TE>
<TE>   Smith was recruited by some mid-sized colleges but stayed home to
work in a factory, to earn money for his grandparents. After his
grandmother died in 1994, Smith went to East Mississippi Junior
College, then spent two years at the University of Houston. He spent
four mostly nondescript years with the Buffalo Bills and was picked
up as a free agent by the Patriots because he'd had some good games
against the Patriots and because somebody in the Patriot front office
recognized that Smith was quiet, hard-working, incredibly strong.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not all that fast," Smith said Sunday night. "Was I insulted
Marshall Faulk got all the attention? Why in the world would I be? He
deserves everything he got. I get what I earn."</TE>
<TE>   Smith, who will turn 30 next month, does not run, as he says,
"with twists and turns. I don't have moves. I don't swivel my hips. I
just run." Smith gained 1,157 yards this year which didn't make him
Faulk but which did make him just what the Patriots needed--somebody
who knew his job and who did it.</TE>
<TE>   He sat with a box of Wheaties in front of him. In this age of
instant marketing, Smith was front and center of six Patriots on a
box of cereal. Being on a box of cereal made Smith laugh. "Just
eating cereal was a big deal for me sometimes," Smith said.</TE>
<TE>   Crennel has coached for 32 years. He is a short-necked,
large-bellied man who teaches his defenders to hit hard, always to
hit hard, to concentrate on hitting hard. No need, he said, to always
be trying to strip the football or knock away the football or
concentrate on making the fancy interception. Just move quickly
toward the man with the ball and hit that man hard.</TE>
<TE>   Here's the measure of Crennel, what he is about, why his players
love and respect him.</TE>
<TE>   When Crennel was a senior at Western Kentucky, after he had been a
three-year starter at defensive lineman and was all set to make a
name for himself in front of pro scouts, the Hilltoppers' offense
quit working because the offensive line was hurting. So Crennel
volunteered to move from the DL to the OL. Pro scouts quit paying
attention but Crennel was named team MVP.</TE>
<TE>   Crennel was named Patriot defensive coordinator a year and three
days ago. In Super Bowl XXXVI, the New England defense made the St.
Louis offense lose its rhythm, its focus, its sense of superiority,
its feeling that any play was possible, that scoring would happen
whenever necessary.</TE>
<TE>   Somebody asked Crennel if he was a defensive genius. Instant
genius status comes pretty easily in the NFL. Every week brings a new
genius.</TE>
<TE>   "No, I am not a genius by any stretch of the imagination," Crennel
said. "I'm just a hard-working coach, I have hard-working players and
we play together as a team very well."</TE>
<TE>   It sounds simple but just working hard, just coaching hard, not
worrying about being a star or a genius, sometimes that's what
winners do.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>If the St. Louis Rams are looking for a key to their 20-17 Super Bowl
loss, the New England Patriot defensive line might be a good place to
start. If the Nevada bookmakers wind up losing on Super Bowl
wagering, the moneyline might be a good place to focus.</LD>
<LD>   As long as the bookmakers set a solid line and don't waver, they
have a chance to balance the betting ledger and thus ride out an
upset like New England's stunning victory Sunday. Most Las Vegas
sports books stuck to a 14-point spread all week.</LD>
<LD>   The damage comes from the moneyline, where bettors who pick the
underdog get no points, but great odds. For example, those who
believed the Patriots could win straight up got odds that opened as
high as 5-1.</LD>
<TE>   "It's a patriotic year, so I guess it's fitting," John Avello of
Bally's-Paris Las Vegas Race and Sports Book told the Associated
Press. "But I would say that, overall, the sports books probably
didn't do well. I think the moneyline is the difference where the
books may have gotten hurt."</TE>
<TE>   Unlike the Rams, the Nevada bookmakers will have to wait a few
days before they learn whether or not they lost.</TE>
<TE>   Volume could be a factor. When the final tabulations are in,
bookmakers are hoping to approach the record $77 million wagered on
the Super Bowl in Nevada in 1998.</TE>
<TE>   Their hopes were buoyed by a huge influx of tourists into Las
Vegas for Super Bowl week, forcing many hotels around town to hang
out "No Vacancy" signs. It was a welcome relief from the ongoing
economic downturn caused by the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.</TE>
<TE>   Super Bowl betting in Nevada has been down each of the last three
years, falling to $67.7 million in 2001. One explanation is the
growth of the offshore bookmakers, who do a thriving business via
phone and the Internet.</TE>
<TE>   Gateway to Sadness</TE>
<TE>   Call off the talk of a dynasty.</TE>
<TE>   Losing the Super Bowl is doubly tough when your team goes in as a
14-point favorite, rallies from a big deficit in the fourth quarter
and still loses on a last-second field goal. That's what St. Louisans
found out Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   At The Cafe sports bar in south St. Louis County, raucous cheers
after the Rams tied the score with 1:30 to play hushed a little more
with each New England play over the final moments. When the field
goal sailed through, there was dead silence.</TE>
<TE>   "Very disappointing ... very disappointing," patron Gerald
Schaeggy said. "But you have to hand it to New England. I thought the
Rams played the game that New England wanted."</TE>
<TE>   St. Louis police had extra patrols out Sunday night--anticipating,
like most everyone else, celebrating crowds--but there were no
reports of problems.</TE>
<TE>   "It's quiet," police spokesman Richard Wilkes said. "I think most
people are too much in shock."</TE>
<TE>   At The Cafe, Lori Wagster thought her pregame prediction-- Rams by
a field goal in overtime-- was about to come true.</TE>
<TE>   "Very heartbreaking," she said. "But, you know, there's always
next year."</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile in Beantown</TE>
<TE>   Bars and living rooms across New England were filled with joy
after Adam Vinatieri's 48-yard field goal as time expired gave the
Patriots the victory.</TE>
<TE>   "We're the champions of the world," Marshfield native Scott Kantor
exclaimed as he and 300 other fans at the Sports Depot restaurant in
Boston leaped in the air as Vinatieri's kick sailed between the
uprights.</TE>
<TE>   "Nobody gave us any respect at all," Kantor continued, pausing to
catch his breath as fans went crazy. "All the so-called experts had
us being blown out."</TE>
<TE>   Patriot fans didn't need to be in the Big Easy to celebrate--they
slammed on horns after pouring out of bars throughout Boston, where
they danced in the streets. There will be more celebrations Tuesday,
when the city hosts a parade from Copley Square to City Hall Plaza at
noon.</TE>
<TE>   Police reported fan rowdiness in streets, but no immediate reports
of arrests or property damage. More than 1,000 fans filled Kenmore
Square and chanted anti-New York Yankee slogans.</TE>
<TE>   "For so long, the city's been known as being losers," fan Dan
Shapira said. "The tables are going to turn. The fans are going to
feed off this and support all the teams."</TE>
<TE>   That's Not the Ticket</TE>
<TE>   The man was very unhappy to be holding a stack of Super Bowl
tickets six hours before kickoff.</TE>
<TE>   "This stinks, definitely the worst Super Bowl I've ever had," he
said. "I'm taking a beating this week. Bad."</TE>
<TE>   The man, who would give only his first name, John, said he sells
tickets at all big sporting events and normally makes a killing on
Super Bowl, but this year tickets have not been in demand.</TE>
<TE>   "Normally, we'd be talking several thousand a ticket," John said.
"Yesterday I was down to $1,000. Now I'm trying to clear a few
hundred a ticket."</TE>
<TE>   No Longer Expos-ed</TE>
<TE>   If Tom Brady had played his cards wrong, he might be a Montreal
Expo farmhand today instead of a Super Bowl MVP.</TE>
<TE>   Instead of focusing on celebrations, he'd be worried about
contraction.</TE>
<TE>   The Expos picked Brady in the 1995 draft as a left-handed hitting
catcher from Serra High in the Bay Area. His father, Tom, was a draft
pick of the Philadelphia Phillies.</TE>
<TE>   So what led Brady to football? Perhaps it was a glorious January
day in 1981.</TE>
<TE>   As a 4-year-old, Brady was there at Candlestick Park when Joe
Montana and Dwight Clark partnered on one of the most famous
touchdowns plays--The Catch--in NFL history.</TE>
<TE>   A Sort of Homecoming</TE>
<TE>   U2 had the Super Bowl halftime stage all to itself, and the Irish
rockers delivered a moving tribute to America and the victims of the
Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.</TE>
<TE>   Lead singer Bono walked onto the field with a slow,
shoulder-wagging swagger, singing the group's recent hit, "Beautiful
Day," as he climbed onto the point of a pink, heart-shaped catwalk
that surrounded the stage.</TE>
<TE>   As the first song wound down, a giant screen scrolled the names of
victims in the attacks, and the group broke into the 1980s hit,
"Where the Streets Have No Name."</TE>
<TE>   Paul McCartney, who was in New York when the hijacked planes
struck the World Trade Center, sang his Sept. 11-inspired song,
"Freedom."</TE>
<TE>   "I'm proud to be here and stand up with America," McCartney said.</TE>
<TE>   Boomer Schmoozer</TE>
<TE>   Two hours before kickoff, a bearded Al Gore made his way through
the press box with his teenage son and several of the boy's friends.</TE>
<TE>   Gore declined to be interviewed, but he did stop to say hello to
former NFL quarterback Boomer Esiason, introducing his son and
flattering Esiason with: "This guy played football the way it's
supposed to be played."</TE>
<TE>   History Lesson Needed</TE>
<TE>   The only other kicker before Vinatieri to boot a game-winning
field goal was Jim O'Brien, whose 32-yard field goal in the final
minute gave the Baltimore Colts a 16-13 win over the Dallas Cowboys
in Super Bowl V.</TE>
<TE>   "Jim O'Brien?" asked Vinatieri when questioned about the
historical prominence. "You have to help me out on that one. Who's
Jim O'Brien?"</TE>

<LD>The U.S. military threw the biggest Super Bowl party in
Afghanistan--even if there was no beer or hot wings.</LD>
<LD>   About 450 soldiers, mostly from the Army's 101st Airborne
Division, based at Fort Campbell, Ky., jammed a tent at the Kandahar
airfield before kickoff at about 4 a.m. Monday local time to watch
the New England Patriots defeat the St. Louis Rams, 20-17.</LD>
<LD>   In its Super Bowl telecast, Fox cut periodically to Kandahar to
show scenes from the party.</LD>
<TE>   The troops celebrated loudest when cheerleaders were shown from
the Superdome in New Orleans.</TE>
<TE>   The military's Super Bowl buffet featured apples and oranges, and
no drinks stronger than lemonade and coffee.</TE>
<TE>   At one point, Army Pfc. Joseph Borgia, 20, got down on his knees
to propose to his girlfriend on the air, holding a grenade ring in
his hand. His girlfriend, Rene Brown, 18, said "yes" later when he
called her from the tent and promised her a real ring.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a morale thing. It's something to remind you of home," said
Army Spc. Joe Cooper, 31.</TE>
<TE>   Army Spc. Myra Sizemore, 28. watched part of the final quarter.</TE>
<TE>   "It's awesome," Sizemore said. "It's a break from the everyday
work here. It's a real treat."</TE>
<TE>   Army Spc. Kendrick Harris, 28, said he only wished the game had
gone into overtime so the party could continue.</TE>
<TE>   "I just wish we could have seen more," Harris said.</TE>

<LD>Before we get to the scoring, time for a Fox Instantpoll: Who thinks
the second half should be canceled and U2 allowed to play for two
more hours?</LD>
<LD>   Scoring: New England 17, St. Louis 3: Adam Vinatieri, 37-yard
field goal at 1:18.</LD>
<LD>   Impact player: Other than Bono? Brady and Smith steadied the
Patriot offense, which had the ball most of the quarter. Smith was
only 15 yards shy of 100 yards rushing when the quarter ended, and
Brady settled down to calmly lead his team into field-goal range.</LD>
<TE>   Missed opportunity: Again, the Rams didn't get Faulk going. He had
only 12 carries through three quarters. And going into the fourth
quarter they were 14 points down and couldn't afford to run the ball
too often. Nice use of the NFL most valuable player runner-up.</TE>
<TE>   Best number: If you are a Patriot fan, you only have to get
through 15 minutes of game time before winning your first Super Bowl
title. If you are a Ram fan, you are only trailing by 14, and the
Rams can put 14 points on the board in about 30 seconds. Of course,
the way the Rams are playing tonight, they might need about 30 hours
to put up 14 points.</TE>
<TE>   Worst number: The version of "A Hard Day's Night" that Terry
Bradshaw sang with Paul McCartney. Oh sure, Paul could never reunite
the Beatles, but he can sing a classic song with Bradshaw on national
TV. It made me want to sing "Help!" And Howie Long kept touching
McCartney's shoulder! He never touches Teri Hatcher during those
Radio Shack commercials. Something is wrong with that.</TE>
<TE>   Instantpoll results: Those who want U2 to sing for the next two
hours: 100%. Those who want to play the second half: 0%. (Informal
poll. I was the only participant.)</TE>

<HD>Forget Curse of the Bambino</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>NEW ORLEANS</DL>
<LD>I don't want to hear anymore about the poor Red Sox, or The Curse of
the Bambino. Please, no more whining from New Englanders about Billy
Buckner or how long-suffering they are. They've got a team, a hero, a
victory, and a championship to take to their graves now, an
in-the-clutch, game-ending play to win the title of all titles, the
Super Bowl. Not just any Super Bowl, either, but absolutely the most
thrilling one ever played, the first one ever to have a team score
the winning points on the final play of the game.</LD>
<LD>   Bill Belichick put together the game plan of his life, helping his
defense score seven points and set up 10 more. Tom Brady, essentially
a rookie quarterback, said he wasn't nervous or worried and played
like Joe Montana those final 81 seconds when the Patriots took over
inside their own 20. And Adam Vinatieri, who started this all by
somehow making an impossible kick in the snow to help beat the
Raiders, kicked the game-winning field goal again, not some
perfunctory chip shot, but a 48-yarder that split the uprights dead
center as the clock ran from :07 to :00.</LD>
<TE>   This is pretty good stuff, as sappy, cornball sports stories go.
The Patriots started the season 0-2, their $100-million quarterback
sidelined with a serious injury, and seemingly no place to go but
down. And even though they won the AFC East, then came back in the
snow to beat the Raiders, then hit the road to beat the favored
Steelers in the playoffs, they fumed all week at being 14-point
underdogs to the Rams.</TE>
<TE>   "I understand why folks doubted we could stop them," Patriot
linebacker Ted Bruschi said.</TE>
<TE>   But he also knew how it felt to be David, triumphantly standing
over a slain Goliath. "I feel like Rocky right now," Bruschi said,
"and I just beat Clubber Lang, Tommy Gun and Apollo Creed. Once in a
while, just once in a while the underdog wins it all."</TE>
<TE>   The NFL actually needed a great game. It needed a thriller to
prove to people the Super Bowl is still the grandest event America
can stage, that it's always worth attending, even if the security
measures are annoying and the teams not universally appealing. The
NFL needed a game that will make those who left early or never showed
look at their TVs and know they missed something compelling and
historic, something like what happened here Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   MICHAEL WILBON</TE>
<TE>   Washington Post</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Other men win a Super Bowl, and it changes them forever.</TE>
<TE>   Nothing of the sort will happen to Bill Belichick. He already has
everything he ever wanted.</TE>
<TE>   The coach's son who was more interested in poring over his
father's game plans than playing with the rest of the 5-year-olds in
the neighborhood has grown into a man who still is more comfortable
with a playbook than people. All week long, Belichick's players
painted a picture of a controlling coach who smiled only grudgingly
when they won, and often was so consumed he wouldn't talk to them
after a loss.</TE>
<TE>   JIM LITKE</TE>
<TE>   Associated Press</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The theme of the day was patriotism.</TE>
<TE>   The game itself was no different.</TE>
<TE>   The red, white and blue was dominant before, during and after
Super Bowl XXXVI. Using a demonstration of spirit, determination and
teamwork, the organizers of the game pulled it off, and so did a
group of coaches and players who were given no chance.</TE>
<TE>   From the very start, the Patriots were a perfect fit for the unity
theme that swirled within the Superdome. All the flag-waving and
anthem-singing was designed to assemble a country anxious to show an
example of togetherness.</TE>
<TE>   Likewise, so were the Patriots. In a break from Super Bowl
tradition, the Patriots were introduced as a team, not individually.
That's the way they played all season, so they figured, why change
now? Brady even felt a little guilty when he accepted the MVP trophy,
which he won largely for his work on the winning drive.</TE>
<TE>   The Super Bowl mirrored their season, because not one player stood
above the rest.</TE>
<TE>   "You can't beat a team like the Rams with individuals," safety
Lawyer Milloy said. "It takes a team. That's what you saw today.
That's what we gave during the evolution of a season."</TE>

<LD>Clarification--In a story in Sunday's Times about disciplinary
reform under Los Angeles Police Chief Bernard C. Parks, Los Angeles
County Public Defender Michael Judge was quoted as saying Parks might be
engaged in "malicious obedience," carrying out reforms in such a way as
to ensure their demise. Judge said the quote mischaracterized his views.
He was referring to Parks' subordinates, not to the chief.</LD>

<DL>LOST HILLS, Calif.
</DL>
<LD>This agricultural outpost in the lower San Joaquin Valley has no
city hall, no municipal police force, no street lights and no benches in
the park for young lovers on hot summer nights.</LD>
<LD>   One thing it does have in surplus is people. Per household, this dusty
spot on the map 40 miles northwest of Bakersfield is the most crowded
community in California. An average of 5.6 people live in every
tumbledown bungalow and rusting mobile home in town.</LD>
<LD>   Of course, that's just an average. "There's three families in there,"
said Rafaela Tijerina, pointing at a pink-and-white double-wide fronted
by a bare dirt lot. "Fifteen people."</LD>
<TE>   Tijerina is at the wheel of her minivan. Outside, a shriveled
community of about 2,000 unfolds along a series of treeless, unpaved
streets plopped down in the middle of some of the richest farmland in the
world. A grass-roots activist who has made this castaway place home for
most of her 60 years, she points at a neat little house with a white
picket fence around one of the few green lawns. "There's 20 people in
there," she said. "In summer, it's worse."</TE>
<TE>   What makes Lost Hills significant is not just that it is crowded, or
that the feisty Tijerina is fighting for its future, but that the
demographic bomb detonating here is exploding all over rural California.
Though most people might imagine teeming urban centers such as southeast
Los Angeles and San Francisco's Chinatown when they think of
overcrowding, an analysis of the 2000 Census shows that the most crowded
places more often are desolate little towns like this one.</TE>
<TE>   Whether it's Pajaro near Salinas, Greenfield south of Monterey, Mecca
east of Palm Springs or Richgrove south of Fresno, these communities
share a common plight: They are packed, poor and populated by Latino farm
workers, many of them first-generation immigrants grasping at the bottom
rung of California's economic ladder.</TE>
<TE>   "If people knew about this they'd be shocked," said Mark Brown, an
official with California Rural Legal Assistance, an advocacy group for
farm workers.</TE>
<TE>   Everyone who's been paying attention knows there's a housing crisis
throughout California. But in these far-flung farm communities, some of
which--like Lost Hills--are not even incorporated, the crisis is more
immediate. Not only is there a lack of housing, but the existing
homes--even crumbling, ticky-tack shacks that in past generations
sheltered a single family--are unaffordable unless people double and
triple up.</TE>
<TE>   "You can find pockets throughout the state," said Brown. "These are
Third World conditions."</TE>
<TE>   According to experts, what's driving this rural population boom is a
combination of factors, from a revolution in farming practices to a
perception by poor immigrants that compared with gang- and drug-infested
inner-city neighborhoods, even end-of-the-road farm hamlets are
preferable. Another cause is the closure of private labor camps because
of tougher enforcement of housing codes. The goal was to make things
better, but the crackdown has forced laborers from overcrowded camps into
overcrowded towns.</TE>
<TE>   Not all the news is bad. The infusion of Latino immigrants has helped
save some communities that were on their way to extinction.</TE>
<TE>   "People tend to see these places as dead-end labor camps," said
Juan-Vicente Palerm, a UC Santa Barbara professor who has studied the
changes occurring in rural California. "But these are real places. You
see immigrants becoming merchants and being elected to the city councils.
There's a revolution going on in rural California."</TE>
<TE>Crowding Grows in Last Decade</TE>
<TE>   But you also continue to see too many people trying to crowd
themselves into too small an area. Crowding in California doubled between
1980 and 1990, said Brown, due in part to passage of the 1986 Immigration
Reform and Control Act, which legalized millions of migrants and
encouraged them to settle. Census figures show that crowding in rural
areas continued to rise in the last decade, even as the government
increased border surveillance.</TE>
<TE>   Across the Pajaro River from Watsonville, the Monterey County
community of Pajaro is 15% more dense than in 1990.</TE>
<TE>   Schools Supt. John Casey said half his students speak limited English.
Many families are in need: The district established a dental-care program
after many students showed up for class with abscessed teeth.</TE>
<TE>   Down the road in Greenfield, the county has been trying to address the
problem by building more housing. They still can't keep up, said Randy
Anstein, the city manager.</TE>
<TE>   "We could increase the housing stock two or three times and you'd
still have people in garages," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Greenfield is a city of about 13,000 just off U.S. 101. Many other
crowded communities straddle important transportation routes. Lost Hills
is three miles west of Interstate 5.</TE>
<TE>   This reflects a changing labor market, as well as an evolution of
farming practices. The era of the migrant farm worker hauling his family
around in a rattling station wagon is ending. Instead of following the
crops up and down the state, workers settle in one area and travel from
farm to farm in the region.</TE>
<TE>   What makes this possible is an extension of the growing season, as
well as a shift in agricultural production to specialty crops, so that
several are being raised in the same area and mature at different times.</TE>
<TE>   Around Greenfield, said Anstein, 89 row crops are harvested. People
living in Lost Hills can pick pistachios, almonds, roses and cotton.
"Some of them travel to work 40 to 60 miles away," said Eustolia Diaz of
the Lost Hills Collaborative, a social agency in town.</TE>
<TE>   While this was happening, private labor camps were being shut down.
"State regulations became so strict," said Palerm, "that a lot of farmers
bulldozed the housing."</TE>
<TE>   But why Lost Hills, or Pajaro, or Mecca, or Thermal, or any of the
other little burgs? They are short on services--the nearest law
enforcement for Lost Hills is the Kern County sheriff's station 20 miles
away in Buttonwillow--and far from any of the things a population center
can provide.</TE>
<TE>   The answer is simple. Places like Lost Hills are the cheapest to live
in. Compared with Lost Hills, even Wasco is a step up.</TE>
<TE>   Alex Rodriguez, 58, is an example. He used to live in Wasco,
population 21,000, but came to Lost Hills to be near a daughter. Then his
wife got sick. Now, they live in a ragged shack and he rides a bicycle to
work at a Days Inn off I-5.</TE>
<TE>   "I've hit bottom," he said. He hastened to point out that unlike his
neighbors born in Mexico, he's lived all his life in the United States
and is used to a better standard of living.</TE>
<TE>1-Bedroom Trailer Costs $300 a Month</TE>
<TE>   A typical one-bedroom trailer home in Lost Hills rents for about $300,
a three-bedroom for up to $430. The housing in town would brighten up
considerably if some landscaping were added, but Tijerina said water
costs too much, so most trailers squat in the dust.</TE>
<TE>   This and other perceived injustices energize this small, intense woman
who speaks halting English. But there's no mistaking her message: Lost
Hills isn't getting a fair shake. Her determination to change the
situation is partly a result of her nature and partly because she grew up
in town. Let others move to Wasco; she'll stand up for Lost Hills.</TE>
<TE>   "She's a fighter," said an admiring county official who has dealt with
Tijerina.</TE>
<TE>   On a recent afternoon, she led the way to the green clapboard house
where Maria Canchola, 41, lives with her family and a boarder who sleeps
on the couch. Masking tape covered holes in the walls, and the heater
didn't work.</TE>
<TE>   Canchola said she moved in two months ago. "The other place was
worse," she said. Its rent was too high, and they had to share it with
two other families.</TE>
<TE>   Compared with most, Rosa Ibel, 21, from Guerrero, Mexico, is lucky.
Her husband has steady work, and their old GM sedan still runs. They are
even saving a bit.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't like it, but what else can I do?" she said in Spanish.</TE>
<TE>   In the past, young families like hers would have looked forward to
moving to the city, either Fresno or Los Angeles. But dishwashing and
similar jobs are the only work available in metropolitan areas to
unskilled laborers. That work doesn't pay any better than farm work. And
with gangs in control of many poor neighborhoods in big cities, family
people like these no longer see urban life as superior.</TE>
<TE>   "At least here we know people," Ibel said.</TE>
<TE>   Besides, no one at the bottom of the wage scale can afford to go out
to eat or see a movie, so there is little difference between the
invisible lives they lead in Lost Hills and the invisible, dangerous
lives they would lead in North Hills or East Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   "I can't take full responsibility for the condition [Lost Hills] is
in," said Ken Peterson, the Kern County supervisor whose district
includes the community. He said he's been trying to get more affordable
housing there, but agrees that some people in Lost Hills couldn't afford
even that.</TE>
<TE>   As for the lack of roads and other infrastructure, he agreed that it
is a serious problem. "Everywhere else in the county we require
developers to put in roads," he said. "But these people are so poor they
can't afford streets."</TE>
<TE>   He said he was hesitant to make an exception to the rules for Lost
Hills because "if I do it somewhere, I'll have to do it everywhere."</TE>
<TE>   But Lost Hills has a secret weapon in Tijerina. Well, maybe not so
secret. She remembers the time when even a farm worker's salary was
enough to pay the rent.</TE>
<TE>   She's angry at what she sees happening around her, and she doesn't shy
away from criticizing officials she thinks ought to be doing something.
It's not fair, she says, considering that this community sits among some
of the most valuable land in the nation. Oil was discovered here in 1910,
and it's still being pumped. And big corporate farms spread from horizon
to horizon.</TE>
<TE>   But Tijerina is living proof that, although it's not easily
accessible, there is an onramp from Lost Hills to the American dream:
Using their savings and government loan programs, she and her husband,
Blas, just purchased a 300-acre ranch.</TE>
<TE>   "I used to work on this land picking. Now I own it," she said. "We
made the American dream come true. Now I want it for everybody."</TE>

<HD>Iran Helped Al Qaeda and Taliban Flee, Rumsfeld Says</HD>
<DH>Asia: Defense secretary asserts that Tehran allowed enemy fighters
to cross from Afghanistan.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ESTHER SCHRADER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>In pointed remarks that raised questions Sunday about future
relations between the elected Iranian regime and the United States,
Secretary of Defense Donald H. Rumsfeld accused the government in Tehran
of helping Taliban and Al Qaeda fighters flee Afghanistan.</LD>
<LD>   Asked on ABC's "This Week" if he could confirm a Time magazine report
that Iran had aided Islamic militants escaping across the Afghan border,
Rumsfeld replied: "I can."</LD>
<LD>   "We have any number of reports that Iran has been permissive and
allowed transit through their country of Al Qaeda," he said.</LD>
<TE>   "There isn't any doubt in my mind but that the porous border between
Iran and Afghanistan has been used for Al Qaeda and Taliban to move into
Iran and find refuge, and that the Iranians have not done what the
Pakistan government has done: put troops along the border and prevent
terrorists from escaping . . . into their country."</TE>
<TE>   Asked if the United States planned any response to Iran's actions,
Rumsfeld said, "We don't announce things we're going to do before we do
them."</TE>
<TE>   Rumsfeld's comments were the latest in a series of signals that the
Washington-Tehran relationship--warmer after the Sept. 11 attacks, when
Iran showed signs of cooperating with the Bush administration's war on
terrorism--has cooled.</TE>
<TE>   Until about a month ago, U.S. officials had expressed hope that the
Afghan crisis might provide common ground for the United States and Iran
to improve their relations, which were broken in 1979 when Islamic
militants seized the U.S. Embassy in Tehran and held 52 Americans hostage
for 444 days.</TE>
<TE>   When the U.S. military campaign in Afghanistan began, Iran pledged to
help with search and rescue missions if U.S. pilots were lost. And
Iranian diplomats backed U.S. and United Nations efforts to build an
alternative regime in Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   But last month, President Bush said Tehran had been trying to exercise
influence that could undermine the new, internationally backed,
broad-based Afghan government. He warned the Iranian regime to stay out
of Afghan affairs.</TE>
<TE>   If the warning was ignored, Bush said, the U.S. would deal with Iran
"in diplomatic ways, initially."</TE>
<TE>   Last week, in his State of the Union address, Bush described Iran,
Iraq and North Korea as an "axis of evil" bent on acquiring weapons of
mass destruction.</TE>
<TE>   And on Sunday, National Security Advisor Condoleezza Rice joined
Rumsfeld in lashing out at Iran.</TE>
<TE>   "This regime deserved to be on the list, and this regime knows it
deserved to be on the list," Rice said on CNN's "Late Edition." She said
Iran is seeking chemical and biological weapons, improving its long-range
missiles and pursuing nuclear weapons capabilities.</TE>
<TE>   Rice accused Iran of trying to interfere in Afghanistan by offering
its support to influential tribal leaders.</TE>
<TE>   "We're even concerned there may be Iranian attempts to surreptitiously
influence Afghan politics at a very delicate time. And the president
spoke out very clearly, saying that the Iranians should not try to
interfere in what is a very delicate political situation in Afghanistan,"
she said.</TE>
<TE>   Iranian officials have denounced Bush's comments and have denied
giving any help to the Taliban or Osama bin Laden's Al Qaeda network.
Iran's government strongly opposed Afghanistan's deposed Taliban regime.</TE>
<TE>   "We hated each other, and we never had any commonalities," the head of
Iran's powerful Guardian Council, Ayatollah Ahmad Jannati, said Friday.
The Iranian regime is Shiite Muslim, while the Taliban imposed a radical
version of the more prevalent Sunni branch of Islam on Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   Time magazine has reported that shortly before the city of Herat, in
western Afghanistan, fell to opposition forces in November, about 250
senior Taliban and Al Qaeda fighters fled in a convoy, crossing into
Iran.</TE>
<TE>   Citing sources in Herat, the magazine said the fugitives made their
escape after a high-ranking Iranian official, connected to supreme leader
Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, was dispatched to Afghanistan to offer them
secret sanctuary.</TE>
<TE>   Rumsfeld did not say Sunday whether Washington will act to seal
Afghanistan's border with Iran. But he characterized the problem of
Iranian aid to America's enemies as serious.</TE>
<TE>   "We have any number of reports more recently that [the Iranian
government has] been supplying arms in Afghanistan to various elements in
the country," Rumsfeld said.</TE>
<TE>   For years, Iran has jostled for influence in Afghanistan with Pakistan
and Russia, the other major powers in the region. Until the Sept. 11
attacks on the U.S., Pakistan supported the Taliban.</TE>
<TE>   Since then, however, Pakistan has strongly backed the U.S. war effort
in Afghanistan, and Rumsfeld chided Iran on Sunday for not acting more
like Pakistan, especially with regard to sealing its border.</TE>
<TE>   Rumsfeld did acknowledge that some terrorist fighters probably have
slipped into Pakistan despite the blockade.</TE>

<HD>Cold War Cover-Up of Murder</HD>
<DH>South Korean officials knew that a man's tale of espionage in his
wife's 1987 slaying was a lie. But they needed to stoke anti-Communist
passions.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BARBARA DEMICK</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SEOUL
</DL>
<LD>Fifteen years ago, Hong Kong police burst into an apartment after
neighbors complained of an unbearable stench and found the decomposing
corpse of a woman with a pillowcase over her head and a belt wrapped
around her neck.</LD>
<LD>   The victim was identified as 34-year-old Suzy Kim, a South Korean bar
hostess. Her husband, who had reported her missing two weeks earlier,
told investigators an incredible story. His wife had been a spy for the
Communist regime in North Korea. She had tried to kidnap him to the North
and was killed, presumably by Communist agents, after the plot failed.</LD>
<LD>   It was a sensational tale, but not altogether implausible given the
turbulent times of 1987. North Koreans indeed had been implicated in
kidnappings of South Koreans. Moreover, the spy drama came at an
opportune time for the South's military dictatorship, which needed to
keep anti-Communist passions at a fever pitch to justify the repression
of opponents at home.</LD>
<TE>   A convenient tale, but a fabrication. The husband, businessman Yoon
Tae Shik, is on trial in Seoul on charges that he murdered Kim during a
quarrel over money. South Korea's former top police officer and a onetime
intelligence official also are on trial, accused of perpetuating the lie
for 15 years.</TE>
<TE>   As the truth oozes out from the unseemly depths of South Korea's past,
it is proving as incredible as the fiction--and embarrassing to both the
right-wingers who ruled South Korea in the 1980s and the liberals now in
power under President Kim Dae Jung. The case is the talk of South Korea
and has scandalized the nation.</TE>
<TE>   If the story ended with the cover-up of Suzy Kim's murder, it might be
just another tale of Cold War skulduggery. But the intrigue also has
infested South Korea's high-flying world of high technology.</TE>
<TE>   After Kim's death, Yoon became a successful venture capitalist in
Seoul and chairman of Pass 21, a company that makes fingerprint detection
software and has deals stretching from Saudi Arabia to Silicon Valley. In
addition to the murder charges, 43-year-old Yoon is accused of plying
dozens of government bureaucrats, legislators and journalists with $1.5
million in cash and stock to advance his company.</TE>
<TE>   So much public anger has welled up over "Yoongate," as South Koreans
call it, and other brewing scandals that President Kim was forced to
apologize last month in his annual New Year's address, promising to "do
my best to see that such corruption is uprooted from this country."</TE>
<TE>   "It is unbelievable. Only in Korea could this happen," said Kim Oak
Kyung, 44, the victim's sister, who with other relatives told the
family's story in a tearful interview.</TE>
<TE>   In many ways, the story of Suzy Kim illustrates how much South Korea
has changed since her slaying and how much remains the same. Until a few
months ago, her name was synonymous with Communist perfidy. Having
neither money nor connections, members of Kim's family had no means to
defend themselves, and their lives were scarred by the scandal.</TE>
<TE>   Suzy Kim was born in 1952 in Chungju, about 70 miles southeast of
Seoul, the third of seven children. Her name was Kim Oak Bun, but her
nickname was Suzy. Her father died when she was a teenager, and she moved
to Hong Kong to earn money for her younger siblings. Although she had
only finished eighth grade, she was ambitious.</TE>
<TE>   In Hong Kong, Kim tried to start a Korean restaurant. It failed, and
she ended up working as a bar hostess. She married and had a daughter,
Sonia, but later discovered that her Chinese husband had another family,
and she left him.</TE>
<TE>   She was 34 and a struggling single mother when she met Yoon in 1986.
Six years younger, he had just moved to Hong Kong to seek his fortune.
They met when he looked at an apartment Kim was subletting and quickly
became engaged.</TE>
<TE>   "My sister was so full of hope and happiness that she had met this
ambitious man who would start a business and give her a good life,"
recalled Kim Oak Kyung.</TE>
<TE>   Suzy Kim brought Yoon to South Korea in October 1986 to register the
marriage and introduce him to the family.</TE>
<TE>   She returned home less than a month later, seeking to borrow $4,000
from the family to invest in a video-rental shop the couple was starting.
She confided that she was a little nervous about her new husband--a
former girlfriend had telephoned to say Yoon had beaten her in the past.
The family was worried.</TE>
<TE>   "Our sister was not the same person. She was restless, chain-smoking,"
recalled another sister, Kim Oak Nim, 40, an insurance saleswoman. "She
was muttering to herself about whether she should leave Yoon or not."</TE>
<TE>   Still, family members scraped together some money with the hope that
the business would bring them all financial security.</TE>
<TE>'Your Sister Is a North Korean Agent!'</TE>
<TE>   On Jan. 7, 1987, a shocking story broke on the evening news in South
Korea. Kim Oak Nim was cooking dinner when her husband yelled from the
other room.</TE>
<TE>   "Come look at this! Your sister is a North Korean agent!" he shouted.
Sure enough, there was Suzy Kim's photograph flashed on the television.
She had disappeared, the news broadcast said, and was presumed to have
escaped to North Korea.</TE>
<TE>   Then there was Yoon, unshaven and teary-eyed, giving a news
conference. He said that a few days earlier, two mysterious Korean men
had come to their Hong Kong apartment to see his wife. She asked Yoon to
go out to buy cigarettes, but when he returned she was gone. Shortly
afterward, he got a telephone call informing him that his wife would be
sold into prostitution if he did not follow instructions. Yoon said that
"like any good husband," he obliged.</TE>
<TE>   Following instructions, he flew to Singapore and took a taxi to an
address he had been given, which turned out to be the North Korean
Embassy. Yoon said he realized then that his wife had defected and was
trying to lure him to the Communist country.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm almost too terrified to talk about it," Yoon said, sobbing,
during one of a series of news conferences organized by the Korean
Central Intelligence Agency, or KCIA, which had picked him up in
Singapore and returned him to Seoul. "I am so relieved to have escaped.
It reminds us that we need to be strong anti-Communists to protect
ourselves," he said.</TE>
<TE>Family Targeted After Allegations</TE>
<TE>   In early 1987, the Cold War between North and South Korea was raging.
The estranged nations regularly accused each other of kidnappings and
terrorism. Anti-Communist sentiments in the South were high.</TE>
<TE>   The consequences for the Kim family were swift and devastating. The
mother and six siblings were picked up for interrogation. The 60-year-old
matriarch was beaten, kicked and sent home by police in the sub-freezing
January temperatures without her winter coat, which had been confiscated
because it was a gift from Suzy Kim.</TE>
<TE>   The oldest sister was fired from her job in a tobacco factory. She had
a nervous breakdown and died of a stroke later that year. The brother, a
truck driver, lost his job and became an alcoholic. The siblings'
children, in turn, were so tormented in school that they were forced to
drop out. All but one of the sisters were forced by their husbands'
families to divorce. Sonia, who had long lived with Suzy Kim's family,
was sent back to Hong Kong to stay with her birth father.</TE>
<TE>   "What we went through individually was beyond description; it was
seven individual stories, but our poor dear mother had to take all on
herself," said Kim Oak Nim. "She spent the last days of her life
repenting what she said were sins in a past life that had brought it on
the family."</TE>
<TE>   At the time of Yoon's news conferences, it was assumed that Suzy Kim
had escaped to North Korea. For a couple of weeks, her family believed
that she was an agent. But then her body was discovered Jan. 24, 1987,
stashed under her bed. The Hong Kong police figured that she had been
killed Jan. 2 or Jan. 3, shortly before Yoon's news conferences. The
South Korean media speculated that she had been killed by the North
Koreans after she failed to kidnap her husband. But her family was
convinced that Yoon had killed her.</TE>
<TE>   The family members were not alone with their suspicions. A doubting
South Korean ambassador to Singapore warned the KCIA not to hold the news
conferences. Hong Kong detectives handling the case were quoted as saying
Yoon's story was "a lot of rubbish."</TE>
<TE>   "We certainly felt that [Yoon] was the prime suspect and that it was
unlikely anyone else could have murdered his wife," Hong Kong police
Supt. Stephen Tarrant said in a recent telephone interview. His
department repeatedly told South Korean authorities during the 1990s that
it wanted to interview Yoon but was told the businessman couldn't be
found, Tarrant said. (During part of that time, Yoon was serving 2 1/2
years in prison on an unrelated conviction for forging credit cards.)</TE>
<TE>   In fact, the KCIA was not entirely clueless. According to court
documents and prosecutors, the KCIA came to realize that Yoon's tale of
escaping a kidnapping plot was bogus, but the agency felt it would be
inadvisable to admit it, given a volatile political situation at home. In
early 1987, the streets of Seoul were choked with tear gas as riot police
battled pro-democracy demonstrators and allegations were flying about the
torture and killings of political opponents.</TE>
<TE>   "His [Yoon's story] was salable to the KCIA at the time. They needed
to distract the public," said Park Young Ryul, director of the
International Crime Investigation Department in Seoul and the lead
prosecutor on Yoon's murder case. "After they reinvestigated, they
realized the truth would hurt the regime, so they hushed it up."</TE>
<TE>   So what really happened?</TE>
<TE>   According to the prosecution theory, outlined in a 48-page indictment,
Yoon married Kim because she had permanent residency in Hong Kong and he
believed that she could help his business. But she was less useful than
he had hoped; the couple fought frequently, and he killed her during a
quarrel. Frantic to avoid prosecution, he fled to Singapore, hoping the
North Korean Embassy there would take him in. He was turned away and,
thinking quickly, concocted the spy story.</TE>
<TE>   Within days of the initial news conference, the KCIA questioned Yoon
and extracted a confession--read into the court record late last month
during his trial--that he had strangled his wife. "I was sitting on top
of her stomach. Her complexion became dark. I thought, people can die so
easily," Yoon told the spy agency, according to the confession.</TE>
<TE>   He tells a different story now. According to his attorney, Yoon
accidentally killed his wife during a fight. If the court accepts this
version, he would be guilty only of manslaughter and free from
prosecution because the statute of limitations is only seven years.</TE>
<TE>   "It is clear that this is a manslaughter case," said Kim Hyon Ho, the
attorney. "In a sense, Mr. Yoon is a victim of the cover-up as well. If
he had been charged at the time, he would have served his sentence
already and have been a free man by now."</TE>
<TE>   None of that explains how Yoon managed to escape prosecution on murder
charges and prosper until his arrest in October. His apparent immunity
continued well into the government of President Kim, who took office in
1998. As a high-tech entrepreneur, Yoon was so respectable that he was
invited to a presidential reception and economic forum in 2000 and had
his picture taken with the South Korean leader.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the unresolved murder case and forgery conviction, Yoon was
able to come up with enough money in 1998 to start Pass 21.</TE>
<TE>   "He is very smooth, very talkative, very persuasive," said S. David
Kim, chief executive of Seoul-based Pass 21. "People were not suspicious
of him."</TE>
<TE>   Had the investigation dragged on a few months longer, Yoon would have
escaped entirely: The statute of limitations for murder in South Korea is
15 years. Although the National Intelligence Service, successor to the
KCIA, in November admitted the cover-up and issued an apology, most of
the people responsible in the agency cannot be charged because the
statute of limitations for obstruction of justice is three years.</TE>
<TE>   The exceptions are Lee Mu Young, once South Korea's top police
official, and Kim Seung Il, a former anti-Communist division chief of the
intelligence agency. Both were indicted in December. They are charged
with trying as late as February 2000 to quash the reopening of the murder
case for fear it would harm relations with North Korea.</TE>
<TE>Investigation Continues to Dredge Up Names</TE>
<TE>   The investigation is continuing, and each day dredges up new names of
those tainted by their association with Yoon. Park Joon Young resigned
Jan. 9 as chief government spokesman after it was alleged that he had
recommended Pass 21 to government agencies and that his niece was on the
company's payroll.</TE>
<TE>   Police officers, prosecutors, tax collectors, journalists and
assemblymen are among those under investigation for allegedly having
received stock in Yoon's company in exchange for favors. A lawyer tapped
by the president to be chairman of a blue-ribbon anti-corruption panel
withdrew his nomination when it was revealed that he had done legal work
for Pass 21.</TE>
<TE>   Even in a country jaded by political scandals, the Yoon affair is
rattling confidence. A survey in December of high school students found
that 91% of respondents believed that their country was corrupt and
one-third believed it was OK to pay a bribe to solve a problem.</TE>
<TE>   But some South Koreans believe that the airing of the scandal is an
encouraging sign. Park Byeong Seug, an assemblyman who in 1987 covered
the case as a journalist, said: "The fact that Yoon has been arrested,
and even the fact that it is now reported in the press, shows how much
Korea is changed. Maybe it is not enough. But Rome wasn't built in a day,
and we have come very far."</TE>
<TE>   Suzy Kim's family has begun to feel a sense of normalcy. In October,
Kim Oak Nim went to Hong Kong for the first time since the slaying to
visit the cemetery where her sister's ashes are buried. She took a
handful of dirt home to leave at the graveside of their mother to signal
the end of the 15-year nightmare.</TE>
<TE>   "My biggest regret is that my mother is not alive today," she said. "I
would like so much to tell her that it is a whole new world out there
now."</TE>

<HD>Enron's Ex-Chief Won't Testify</HD>
<DH>Hearings: Kenneth L. Lay pulls out of scheduled appearance before
Senate Commerce Committee, evoking harsh reaction from congressional
leaders.</DH>

<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>Former Enron Chairman Kenneth L. Lay on Sunday abruptly canceled
his much-anticipated appearance before Congress, contending he would not
receive a fair hearing.</LD>
<LD>   Lay changed his mind about testifying before the Senate Commerce
Committee today, after comments by congressional leaders on Sunday
television news shows suggested that "judgments have been reached and the
tenor of the hearing will be prosecutorial," said his attorney, Earl J.
Silbert.</LD>
<LD>   Lay had agreed to appear voluntarily at the hearing, though other
committees have issued subpoenas in the Enron investigation. Committee
sources said no decision had been reached as of Sunday night on whether
the members will subpoena Lay to appear in the future.</LD>
<TE>   His client "cannot be expected to participate in a proceeding in which
conclusions have been reached before Mr. Lay has been given an
opportunity to be heard," Silbert said in a letter to Sen. Ernest F.
Hollings (D-S.C.), the committee chairman, and Rep. Michael G. Oxley
(R-Ohio).</TE>
<TE>   Until Jan. 23, Lay was chairman and chief executive of Enron Corp.,
once the country's seventh-largest corporation. The energy company filed
for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection Dec. 2 after questions about its
financial health and questionable accounting practices sent its stock
plummeting.</TE>
<TE>   The Senate Commerce Committee hearing--at which Lay was to be the only
witness--was canceled. The House Financial Services subcommittee on
capital markets will hear this afternoon from Securities and Exchange
Commission Chairman Harvey L. Pitt and from William Powers, the
University of Texas law professor who led an internal inquiry into the
company's collapse. The report of that inquiry--a scathing rebuke to the
company, its directors and its accounting firm, Andersen--was released
late Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   Lay also had been scheduled to appear Tuesday before the House
Financial Services subcommittee, along with Andersen Chairman and CEO
Joseph F. Berardino, but will not attend that hearing either.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile on Sunday, Berardino, whose firm also faces several federal
and congressional probes, said Andersen hired former Federal Reserve
Chairman Paul A. Volcker to head a panel to help overhaul the way the
firm operates. "It's obvious the public has been let down more than
once," Berardino said. "We will be very tough on ourselves."</TE>
<TE>   Lay's decision evoked a harsh reaction from congressional leaders.</TE>
<TE>   "I am disappointed," said Sen. Byron Dorgan (D-N.D.), chairman of the
Senate Commerce subcommittee on consumer affairs, the panel before which
Lay was scheduled to testify. "I believe the American people, the
Congress and his own employees have a right to hear a public explanation
of what happened at the Enron Corp."</TE>
<TE>   "I doubt they ever thought appearing before a congressional committee
would be a walk in the park," Dorgan added, "because there are tough and
difficult questions that need answers. . . . Eventually, Mr. Lay and
others will have to provide those answers, and sooner rather than later."</TE>
<TE>   Lay, who reportedly accepted the committee's invitation to appear
against his attorney's advice and without any offer of immunity, was in
Washington on Sunday preparing for his appearance. But while listening to
lawmakers on the talk shows, he heard "inflammatory statements"
suggesting that "judgments have been reached and the tenor of the hearing
will be prosecutorial," Silbert said.</TE>
<TE>   The lawyer cited a comment by Rep. W.J. "Billy" Tauzin (R-La.),
chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, predicting that some
senior company executives will end up "in the pokey."</TE>
<TE>   Silbert also cited a remark by Dorgan on NBC's "Meet the Press" that
the largest bankruptcy filing in corporate history put some people in
"real jeopardy."</TE>
<TE>   Rep. Henry A. Waxman (D-Los Angeles), a senior Democrat on the House
Energy and Commerce Committee--one of a dozen congressional committees
investigating the Enron collapse--said, "It's a real setback for those of
us who want some accountability from this man."</TE>
<TE>   Waxman said Congress should subpoena Lay because he will not testify
voluntarily.</TE>
<TE>   "It looks like statements that he made that he was willing to be
cooperative were not sincere," Waxman added.</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Peter Fitzgerald (R-Ill.), top Republican on the Senate Commerce
subcommittee on consumer affairs, said: "In my judgment, Mr. Lay is again
taking a dive."</TE>
<TE>   "It's that lack of accountability and responsibility that led to the
Enron debacle in the first place. He will eventually have to answer
questions--perhaps not before the Commerce Committee but possibly in a
forum where his testimony can be compelled."</TE>
<TE>   Lay's appearance was to kick off a week of hearings on Capitol Hill
probing Enron's collapse and featuring a notable list of witnesses.
Andrew S. Fastow, the company's former chief financial officer, is
scheduled to appear before the House Energy and Commerce subcommittee
Thursday but is expected to invoke the 5th Amendment.</TE>
<TE>   Former Enron CEO Jeffrey K. Skilling, who left the company in August,
also is scheduled to appear before the panel.</TE>
<TE>   Fitzgerald noted that the Powers report was critical of many parties,
including Lay.</TE>
<TE>   Congress will use the information it unearths to determine what laws
may have been broken and whether any laws or regulations should be
changed to prevent such corporate misdeeds. The information also may be
used by the Justice Department as it investigates possible criminal
wrongdoing by the company, whose downfall left more than 6,000 people
without jobs and shattered the savings of thousands of employees and
investors.</TE>
<TE>   Enron attorney Robert S. Bennett said Sunday: "The company is fully
cooperating with Congress, and we are encouraging people who are
requested to testify to testify. But I have read Mr. Silbert's, letter
and I understand his concerns and the sound basis for them."</TE>
<TE>   Earlier Sunday, Waxman said in an interview that Lay should reveal the
identities of investors in more than 3,000 controversial off-the-books
partnerships that led to the company's collapse. The names were left out
of the Powers report.</TE>
<TE>   "These entities became the basis for looting the corporation," Waxman
said. "If we want to know where the money went, we need to know who these
partners were."</TE>

<DL>BOCA RATON, Fla.
</DL>
<LD>Journalism, the art and craft of catching history on the fly and
pinning it down on a sheet of newsprint, reserves a special place of
honor for those who practice it in cases of extreme adversity.</LD>
<LD>   In the annals of American newspapering, however, what happened in this
seaside, upscale Florida town last autumn was unprecedented. In the
inimitable style of the publications that were involved, it might be
summed up in punchy headlines:</LD>
<LD>   "Germs Invade Supermarket Tabs! Hero Journos Keep Presses Rolling!"</LD>
<TE>   The employees of American Media Inc.--which publishes the National
Enquirer, Star, Globe, Weekly World News, Sun and National Examiner--have
come up with a bit of doggerel of their own to describe their frightening
encounter with the anthrax bacteria and what followed: "evacuated,
medicated, dedicated."</TE>
<TE>   They also have been ostracized by some of their neighbors, their
publications have been plagued by declining circulations and the head of
their company has threatened to pull out of Florida altogether.</TE>
<TE>   "There is good news," said Steve Coz, editorial director of the six
tabs, over a breakfast of scrambled eggs. "Liza Minnelli rehabbed herself
for her upcoming wedding."</TE>
<TE>   More than three months on, it's still not known who introduced deadly
anthrax into AMI's headquarters or why the weeklies were targeted.</TE>
<TE>   The infestation of spores killed one employee--popular British-born
photo editor Bob Stevens--landed another worker in the hospital and
infected a third, sowed fear and doubt among the staff and compelled
public health authorities to quarantine the building, forcing the staff
to work in cramped temporary quarters or at home.</TE>
<TE>   More than 1,100 AMI employees and recent visitors to the building were
given nasal swabs to test for anthrax, then issued a dose of antibiotics.
More than 1,000 postal workers also were tested, but no other cases were
reported.</TE>
<TE>   "As a newsperson, you are covering other people's tragedies all the
time, but the notion that it is happening to you, especially coming right
into your own newsroom, is shocking," said Leon Wagener, news editor of
the Star, one of the papers. "Anyone who had been in that building was
possibly infected."</TE>
<TE>   For Wagener, that meant not only himself but his 10-year-old daughter,
Madison, who had been a frequent visitor. For 60 anxious days, as the
girl swallowed antibiotics along with her father, Wagener watched for
symptoms of anthrax: headache, vomiting, chills, fever, often followed by
death within 24 to 36 hours.</TE>
<TE>   "Fortunately, she didn't have any bad effects physically, but
psychologically she did," Wagener said. "She had a concern about letting
anyone in Boca know that she might be one of the victims. There was a
stigma, especially among children."</TE>
<TE>   But the threat of sudden death by disease was only half the double
whammy of events that caught the tabs in its vise. Not only have the
papers and their employees had to cope with anthrax, but their
readers--AMI claims total weekly readership of 45 million--have had
plenty of other things to think about since September. Spokesman Gerald
McKelvey said overall circulation at one point dropped by as much as a
third and still is down 8%.</TE>
<TE>   In a country that defines itself as at war, people may be less
interested in the love life of Tom Cruise and more in how operations in
Afghanistan are proceeding.</TE>
<TE>   "People have only so much reading capacity every day," said Doug
Arthur, a newspaper industry analyst in New York. "Suddenly there have
been so many life-threatening things to keep track of."</TE>
<TE>   The three-story AMI headquarters building in a Boca Raton office park
remains closed and has been ringed with a fence and yellow crime-scene
tape to keep out the curious. Tourists, some from as far away as Japan,
show up once in a while to have their pictures taken.</TE>
<TE>   The fountain by the entrance no longer gurgles, and the once manicured
grounds have grown unkempt. At night, security guard Bill Cochrane says,
the still-illuminated computer screens inside the building cast an eerie,
disconcerting light.</TE>
<TE>   "It's like somebody came by and went pfft! and everybody disappeared,"
the retired policeman said.</TE>
<TE>   Was the tabs' anthrax infestation the next salvo in the terrorist
campaign against the U.S. that many had been bracing for? Government
investigators discount any connection to Al Qaeda terrorists, but some at
AMI, including Chairman David J. Pecker, believe the company was targeted
by Muslim extremists because it has the word "American" in its name.</TE>
<TE>   Pecker can cite circumstantial evidence to support his conclusion. Of
the 19 young hijackers who crashed airliners into the World Trade Center
and Pentagon on Sept. 11, 14 of them for a time lived in communities
bordering Boca Raton. The wife of one AMI editor even rented two of them
an apartment.</TE>
<TE>   "My personal theory is, I don't believe in coincidences," Pecker said.
"Just a month before, I had a big sign--'American Media'--put up."</TE>
<TE>   If Pecker is right, this biological attack on the United States opened
in this comfortable community of 75,000, which became famous during the
Roaring '20s as a sun-kissed watering hole for the rich. Attention
quickly shifted northward, however, when letters laden with the
rod-shaped Bacillus anthracis germ surfaced in the Senate's Hart office
building, at NBC-TV and the New York Post in Manhattan and at a New
Jersey post office.</TE>
<TE>   What first seemed like a bizarre and life-threatening problem for the
tabs was now a bona fide national emergency. In all, five people died and
18 others were infected but survived, according to the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta.</TE>
<TE>   At this point in the massive FBI-led investigation, in which the
reward for information was just upped to $2.5 million, the government's
working hypothesis is that the unknown anthrax attacker is a "home-grown"
terrorist nursing a grudge, similar to Unabomber Theodore J. Kaczynski.</TE>
<TE>   "Were these letters sent to us by Osama bin Laden? I don't think so,"
said an FBI agent in Washington, speaking on condition of anonymity. "If
this were Al Qaeda, they would have sent a thousand letters."</TE>
<TE>   Among professional journalists, the AMI tabloids get about as much
respect as a starred French chef accords lunch at Burger King. But under
Pecker and Coz, the tabs have cut down on the lurid (and, at one times
perhaps, occasionally invented) content and concentrated on news and
celebrity coverage.</TE>
<TE>   Of late, the tabs have scored some reporting firsts, for instance
during the Clinton White House scandals, and in revealing that the Rev.
Jesse Jackson had fathered a child out of wedlock. Yet few in the media
still consider what these papers do to be respectable mainstream
journalism.</TE>
<TE>   Since the U.S. war on terrorism began, AMI weeklies have printed an
expose claiming that Bin Laden suffers from "underdeveloped sexual
organs," branded his followers "slime balls" and alerted readers that for
$19 they can buy toilet paper bearing Bin Laden's image.</TE>
<TE>   Frankly, none of this is Pulitzer Prize material. But, in how they
faced the anthrax crisis and have coped since, the supermarket tabs may
have known their finest hour.</TE>
<TE>   "These people have really gone through what would be a horrific time
in anybody's lives," Pecker said admiringly. "I wouldn't wish it on
anyone."</TE>
<TE>   For some of their neighbors on Florida's southeastern coast, AMI
editors and reporters became pariahs. At one point, when Pecker's
mother-in-law went to have her hair done at a beauty parlor in nearby
Boynton Beach, the employees, who knew her, wouldn't let her in. They
were worried she might somehow give them anthrax.</TE>
<TE>   "There was no sympathy at all in the community," Pecker said.</TE>
<TE>   It was 6:30 on a Sunday evening in October when the AMI chairman, who
was alone at headquarters with a security guard, got the call telling him
to leave immediately. The test results had come back from swabs performed
on Stevens' computer keyboard. They had tested positive for anthrax.</TE>
<TE>   (Ultimately, the hard-shelled spores would be detected at 84 locations
on all three floors of the AMI building, said Tim O'Connor, a Palm Beach
County Health Department spokesman. The germs also were found at seven
area post offices, in trails consistent with tainted mail presumably sent
to the tabs.)</TE>
<TE>   Suddenly, Pecker said, "we had no building to go back to." Yet the
next day was closing--final publication deadline--for the three most
important papers: the Enquirer, the Globe and the Star.</TE>
<TE>   That evening, Pecker and Coz called a "war council" with AMI
executives at a separate circulation building in Delray Beach, about 10
miles north of Boca Raton. Before the night was out, there were 40
editors on hand, mapping out pages for the coming week's editions.</TE>
<TE>   To play it safe in tropical storm-prone Florida, the staffs had
concocted "hurricane pages" of material that could be published any time.
These features, including a "Stupid Cupid" review of Hollywood marriages
that crashed and burned, were siphoned by phone and Internet from the
computers now out of bounds at headquarters.</TE>
<TE>   Within 48 hours, Pecker had bought 500 desktop and notebook computers
to replace hardware now potentially contaminated by anthrax. He estimates
he spent $10 million from his own pocket to make his tabs operational
again. His staff, he said, performed with the same aplomb as the U.S.
military personnel who quickly rebuilt the airfield in Kabul, the Afghan
capital.</TE>
<TE>   "We didn't miss a single page," Coz said. For journalists, who aspire
to the Hemingway ideal of courage--grace under pressure--that is the most
treasured praise of all. And at the time, AMI personnel were laboring
under the added uncertainly of the anthrax threat, not knowing if they
had been infected. Even the medicine they were given caused health
problems, including diarrhea and stomach cramps.</TE>
<TE>   The staff at AMI is much harsher when assessing the performance of the
government. The bacterial outbreak brought a veritable army of official
organizations to Boca Raton: the FBI, CDC, Environmental Protection
Agency, Army intelligence, Coast Guard and state and county health
departments.</TE>
<TE>   "There was no coordination among the agencies," Pecker said.</TE>
<TE>   When Stevens, the 63-year-old photo editor, died Oct. 5 of inhaled
anthrax, people at AMI learned of it by reading the Miami Herald's Web
site. "I think as CEO I should have gotten a call," Pecker said.</TE>
<TE>   Another AMI employee, mail-room worker Ernesto Blanco, 74, found out
he had been infected with the bacteria when the TV set in his room, tuned
to CNN, announced it. He had been hospitalized in Miami with delirium, a
105-degree fever, and his doctors, who were bewildered by his symptoms,
thought he was dying.</TE>
<TE>   Because the disease was caught in time, Blanco survived. Deeply
religious, he believes that "God needed me more here." The Cuban-born man
his colleagues affectionately call "Ernie" handled 5,000 pieces of mail a
day, and he can't remember which one might have transmitted the bacteria.
Doctors haven't yet approved Blanco's return to work, but when he handles
his mail at home, he now wears gloves.</TE>
<TE>   O'Connor, the health department spokesman, said officials were facing
the gravest public health emergency in years, and one without any true
precedent.</TE>
<TE>   "It's been a huge undertaking just to keep up with people and make
sure they have somewhere to turn," O'Connor said. "Unfortunately, we did
lose Mr. Stevens early. But Mr. Blanco did recover."</TE>
<TE>   The next phase in the tabs' battle back to something approaching
normality is set to occur by Feb. 18, when AMI is supposed to move into
53,000 square feet of leased office space a quarter of a mile from its
shuttered headquarters. That will allow all reporters and editors to
again work under one roof.</TE>
<TE>   To boost revenue, the newsstand prices on at least two of the
tabs--the Enquirer and the Star--are being increased and the papers will
be bulked up from 48 pages to 60. That, Pecker said, should help him sell
more ads.</TE>
<TE>   Cleanup of the headquarters building should last a year, but it's not
certain whether AMI ever will go back. Coz admits that his wife is
opposed to him ever again setting foot in the place. On the other hand,
Terry Jackson, editor in chief of an AMI monthly, Auto World Magazine,
said he is willing to take his chances now to retrieve his Rolodex.</TE>
<TE>   "I think if we go back in that building, we're probably talking two
years from now," Jackson said.</TE>
<TE>   If, that is, AMI decides to remain in Florida. Irked about how
everyone from Gov. Jeb Bush on down has dealt with the anthrax crisis,
the publisher has talked of moving his tabs and their multimillion-dollar
payroll elsewhere. AMI is as much a victim of terrorism as any tenant at
the World Trade Center, Pecker said, "but to date, I have received no
financial help or assistance from any government agency."</TE>
<TE>   At AMI, many feel they were forgotten as soon as the anthrax crisis
rolled north.</TE>
<TE>   "Of course, we're all sort of angry that no one's been caught,"
Jackson said. "And when the anthrax moved to Washington and New York, the
media largely ignored AMI. I haven't read much about us and the fact a
man was killed here."</TE>

<HD>Experts Say Farms, Not Fish, Should Get Disputed Water</HD>
<DH>Science: Federal panel finds there was no basis for policy that led
to Klamath confrontations.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ERIC BAILEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO
</DL>
<LD>The National Academy of Sciences has determined that federal
regulators erred by sharply limiting water to the Klamath Basin's
drought-stricken farmers last summer to save endangered fish.</LD>
<LD>   The academy concluded that there is "no substantial scientific
foundation" for a decision by federal biologists that led to water
cutbacks last April to agriculture fields to help endangered salmon and
suckerfish.</LD>
<LD>   But the 12-scientist panel that reviewed the situation in Klamath, a
broad swath of marshes and farmland straddling the Oregon and California
border, also found fault with recent water allocation proposals by the
U.S. Bureau of Reclamation that favored farmers over fish.</LD>
<TE>   The 26-page interim report, which will be released Wednesday but was
obtained Sunday evening by The Times, also suggests that water be divvied
up between fish and agriculture at about the same levels as it has for
the past decade.</TE>
<TE>   The provocative findings of the report, ordered up by the Bush
administration last fall, are likely to have a profound effect on one of
the nation's most contentious environmental battles in recent years.</TE>
<TE>   The academy's conclusions represented a significant victory for
farmers, who for years have questioned the biological opinions offered by
the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and National Marine Fisheries Service,
which act as stewards for the environment.</TE>
<TE>   Those federal agencies advocated higher lake levels in Upper Klamath
Lake to save two endangered suckerfish species and higher flows into the
Klamath River to help the beleaguered coho salmon.</TE>
<TE>   With more water for the fish, the farmers were left with less, a
result that turned disastrous last year as the Klamath region went
through one of its worst droughts ever.</TE>
<TE>   "They're concluding what we've been saying for 10 years," said Rob
Crawford, a farmer in Tulelake, Calif. "But to have the academy say it
sends a very clear message to a lot of folks: This just can't continue.
American communities can't continue to be treated the way we've been."</TE>
<TE>   Environmentalists, fishermen and Native American tribes--who support
the water restrictions in the Klamath as a way to help revive fish
populations--were dismayed by the findings.</TE>
<TE>   "It's hard to believe, given the declines in the Klamath's fisheries,"
said Jay Watson, the Wilderness Society's state regional director. "The
sucker and salmon populations have been hammered."</TE>
<TE>   Jim McCarthy of the Klamath Forest Alliance said the scientific
panel's findings are undercut because it lacked a key ingredient: an
expert on lakes.</TE>
<TE>   "I think their findings are suspect," McCarthy said. ". . .It seems
this administration is adopting a completely confrontational policy
against environmental protection. It's at odds with the values of the
American public."</TE>
<TE>   The academy's findings come amid increasing signs that the Bush
administration intends to do whatever it can to ensure that farmers in
the region don't go dry.</TE>
<TE>   The president vowed during a speech in Portland last month to do
everything in his power to help Klamath's farmers. Interior Secretary
Gale Norton, who oversees all the federal agencies embroiled in the
Klamath fight, has hinted throughout the crisis that she felt hamstrung
by the biological opinions and hoped to somehow reverse course.</TE>
<TE>   Federal officials involved in the Klamath debate, meanwhile, were
scrambling after learning of the academy's findings. After reviewing the
interim report, Norton ordered the various agencies to evaluate the
academy's findings over the next 10 days.</TE>
<TE>   Klamath's travails were ignited last year after a ruling by federal
biologists forced the new Bush administration to order water cutbacks to
farmers, prompting a storm of protest in the region.</TE>
<TE>   Demonstrations throughout the summer drew a broad swath of activists,
including property-rights advocates and anti-government adherents.</TE>
<TE>   But the fight exploded as protesters repeatedly stormed the head-gates
at the main irrigation canal, forcing them open. After local police
refused to weigh in, federal agents had to patrol the gates around the
clock.</TE>
<TE>   At Norton's request, the academy launched a study of the biological
data used to justify the water cutbacks last year.</TE>
<TE>   It found that previous study "has not show a clear connection" between
higher lake levels and improved conditions for the suckerfish, noting
that incidents of fish die-offs have not paralleled years of low water
level.</TE>
<TE>   Concurrently, the academy concluded that salmon could be hurt by
releasing extra water during drought years like 2001. The water is warmed
up significantly in upstream reservoirs, to a level that would "equal or
exceed the lethal temperatures" for coho salmon during hot summer months,
the academy found. "Addition of substantial amounts of warm water could
be detrimental."</TE>
<TE>   But the academy also found fault with proposals by the U.S. Bureau of
Reclamation, which operates the system of canals and dams that provide
Klamath's irrigation water. Last week, the bureau released a study that
proposes sharp reductions in lake levels and to the river downstream,
presenting what the academy calls "an unknown risk" to the fish. The
academy suggested the agency stick to its usual methods.</TE>
<TE>   The National Academy of Sciences is an arm of the federal government
called on to settle scientific disputes. The 12 members of the panel that
reviewed the Klamath situation are scientists drawn from universities
around the country.</TE>
<TE>   More than 200,000 acres of farmland in the basin is irrigated by the
federal project, which was launched nearly a century ago and is one of
the oldest such efforts in the West.</TE>

<HD>44 Killed in Turkish Temblor</HD>
<DH>Disaster: More than 150 people are injured after magnitude 6 quake.
Shoddy construction gets blame for damage's scope.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>AMBERIN ZAMAN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL>ANKARA, Turkey
</DL>
<LD>At least 44 people were killed and more than 150 others injured
Sunday in an earthquake that rocked the province of Afyon in central
Turkey, toppling scores of buildings.</LD>
<LD>   The epicenter of the magnitude 6 quake was the town of Bolvadin, about
190 miles southeast of Turkey's largest city, Istanbul, and home to about
40,000 people.</LD>
<LD>   The tremor, which struck at 9:11 a.m. and was followed by nearly 30
aftershocks, was reported to have had the worst impact on the village of
Sultandagi, seven miles south of Bolvadin. At least 15 people died in the
village, where dozens of homes lay in ruins.</LD>
<TE>   Turkey lies atop a major fault line and is frequently hit by
earthquakes. Bolvadin was last struck by an earthquake in 1914. It
claimed 400 lives.</TE>
<TE>   On Sunday, rescue workers accompanied by sniffer dogs worked around
the clock to pull out at least 11 victims believed to be trapped under
the rubble across the disaster zone, while panicked survivors fled in
fear of aftershocks.</TE>
<TE>   Other survivors wandered around shaking and dazed, their clothes
coated in white dust, in scenes reminiscent of those after the quake that
devastated northwestern Turkey in 1999, killing at least 17,000 people.</TE>
<TE>   At that time, rescue workers and aid poured in from around the world,
including from Turkey's longtime rival and neighbor, Greece. On Sunday,
Greek authorities offered to send in rescue workers again, in a further
sign of steadily improving ties between the two countries.</TE>
<TE>   "We express our solidarity toward the troubled people and government
of Turkey, who have again been struck hard by another earthquake," said
Greek Foreign Minister George Papandreou after meeting in New York with
his Turkish counterpart, Ismail Cem. "We express our deepest condolences
to the families of those lost."</TE>
<TE>   The Turkish Foreign Ministry said that Turkey was grateful for the
offer but that it was not in need of any outside help at the moment.</TE>
<TE>   Sunday's tremor was felt in a wide area, stretching across the central
Anatolian provinces all the way to Ankara, the capital, which lies about
120 miles northeast of Bolvadin.</TE>
<TE>   In the neighboring province of Konya, one person died of a heart
attack and seven people were injured after jumping out of windows and off
balconies, the private news channel NTV said.</TE>
<TE>   The quake was also felt on eastern Greek islands near Turkey's coast,
but there were no reports of damage or injury.</TE>
<TE>   Afyon, which means "opium" in Turkish--so named because it is where
the bulk of Turkey's opium poppies are grown--is a rural province of
about 1 million people.</TE>
<TE>   At least 150 buildings collapsed in Sunday's quake, according to
preliminary reports from a crisis center set up in Ankara to coordinate
rescue and relief efforts.</TE>
<TE>   Most were shops and offices. Four mosques in Bolvadin were also
destroyed, and--as in 1999--shoddy construction materials used by
unscrupulous contractors were blamed for the extent of the damage.</TE>
<TE>   Public Works Minister Abdulkadir Akcan said the death toll could have
been much worse had the quake struck during a workday.</TE>
<TE>   "In Afyon, there is a large number of slightly damaged buildings,"
Akcan said. "Because today is Sunday and shops are closed, a huge
disaster was prevented."</TE>
<TE>   Turkish authorities, much criticized for their sluggish response to
the 1999 temblor, seemed to be firmly in control in this disaster.
Thousands of tents and blankets were delivered to the disaster zone only
hours after the quake, and Turkish troops helped put up makeshift
shelters for residents left homeless.</TE>
<TE>   Before heading to Afyon to inspect the damage, Prime Minister Bulent
Ecevit appeared on national television to warn residents to stay away
from damaged homes.</TE>
<TE>   Apparently heeding his calls, survivors huddled throughout the night
around makeshift fires outside freshly erected plastic tents as
temperatures plunged.</TE>
<TE>   "It is a terrible tragedy, and our greatest consolation is that we do
not expect the fatalities to rise much further," Ecevit said.</TE>

<HD>Israeli Cabinet Backs Palestinian Talks</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARY CURTIUS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>JERUSALEM
</DL>
<LD>Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon won backing Sunday from nearly
all his Cabinet ministers for having initiated his first talks with
Palestinian officials since his election, and he said he will hold more
such meetings.</LD>
<LD>   Jewish settlers and the far right blasted Sharon's session with a trio
of senior Palestinian officials last week, saying it violated his pledge
not to negotiate under fire. But most Cabinet ministers praised it as a
breakthrough after more than 16 months of fighting.</LD>
<LD>   "If there's a chance in it to achieve a cease-fire, it will be
desirable and acceptable to all of us," said Interior Minister Eli
Yishai, of the ultra-Orthodox Shas Party.</LD>
<TE>   In an interview with Israel's Channel Two television, however, Sharon
made it clear Sunday night that his new willingness to talk to the
Palestinians does not extend to their leader, Yasser Arafat. Israel has
kept Arafat confined to the West Bank city of Ramallah for two months,
saying he will be free to move about only if he arrests the killers of
Tourism Minister Rehavam Zeevi, who was shot to death in October. The
government also has declared Arafat "irrelevant," a term Sharon used
again to describe the besieged Palestinian Authority president.</TE>
<TE>   Political sources in Jerusalem said Sharon still intends to ask
President Bush to sever ties with Arafat. The Israeli leader is to visit
the White House on Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   In Washington, Secretary of State Colin L. Powell said he was pleased
with the meeting between Sharon and the Palestinian officials.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm going to be conducting the same kinds of dialogue with the
Palestinian Authority," Powell said Sunday on CBS's "Face the Nation."
Powell said he is "pleased to see that Prime Minister Sharon met with a
number of them the other day, and I will be meeting with them as well in
the days ahead, trying to get this process started." The United States,
Powell said, "can't walk away from the current crisis in the Middle
East."</TE>
<TE>Arafat Makes Overture With Newspaper Article</TE>
<TE>   On Channel Two, Sharon dismissed Arafat's latest overture to Israelis,
an article published in Sunday's New York Times. Arafat wrote that the
Palestinians are ready to end their conflict with Israel and will take
Israel's demographic concerns into consideration in trying to resolve the
fate of Palestinian refugees. He also said he will arrest militants who
attack Israeli civilians.</TE>
<TE>   "Arafat talks on," Sharon said. "Certainly the comments were written
in softer language. When it comes to talking, he does it well."</TE>
<TE>   But the article did not persuade him, Sharon said, adding, "I suggest
that he doesn't persuade anyone." Arafat, he said, "is irrelevant."</TE>
<TE>   In contrast to his dismissive approach to Arafat, Sharon described the
meeting he held at his official Jerusalem residence Wednesday night with
a trio of senior Palestinian officials as "a respectful and positive one"
in which "both sides spoke their heart." He insisted that the focus of
the meeting, which started with dinner and lasted past midnight, was
security.</TE>
<TE>   Sharon said that he discussed only one political subject with the
speaker of the Palestinian parliament, Ahmed Korei; Arafat's unofficial
deputy, Mahmoud Abbas; and Arafat's financial advisor, Mohammed Rashid.
That subject was the negotiations that Korei has been conducting with
Israeli Foreign Minister Shimon Peres.</TE>
<TE>   There is "a profound difference," Sharon said he told Korei, between
the peace plan Peres is promoting and Sharon's vision of an agreement.</TE>
<TE>   Peres has proposed that Israel immediately recognize a Palestinian
state in more than 40% of the West Bank and in the Gaza Strip. The two
sides would then, within an agreed-upon time frame, negotiate unresolved
"final-status" issues, such as the fate of Jerusalem and of Palestinian
refugees who lost their homes when the Jewish state was created in 1948.</TE>
<TE>Sharon Says He Opposes Foreign Minister's Plan</TE>
<TE>   Sharon said he did not discuss the question of a Palestinian state
with his guests. But he said he told them that he objects to Peres'
proposal that the negotiations proceed according to a timetable.</TE>
<TE>   "I am speaking about a stage in which there is a development in our
relationship that leads to a cease-fire or a non-fighting status," he
said. Only after agreed-upon measures were implemented by both sides, he
said, would they proceed to discussing final-status issues.</TE>
<TE>   Sharon said he demanded of the Palestinians that they arrest
"terrorists" and dismantle Palestinian militias, including Arafat's
presidential guard, Force 17, and the Tanzim militia of Arafat's Fatah
movement. He said he told the Palestinians that they must also confiscate
illegal weapons and hand them over to the United States, take unspecified
preventive measures to stop attacks on Israelis and end incitement.</TE>
<TE>   The prime minister said he invited the Palestinian officials to his
home because "I have noticed lately that the Palestinians don't fully
understand what the Israeli demands are which are necessary to proceed
with a diplomatic process."</TE>
<TE>   According to Palestinian officials, the Palestinians demanded a halt
to Israel's "targeted killings" of militants--slayings the Palestinians
call assassinations. They also asked Sharon to allow Arafat freedom of
movement, stop incursions into Palestinian-controlled territories and end
Israel's blockades of Palestinian towns and villages.</TE>
<TE>   No agreements were reached, but the two sides did hold a security
meeting Friday, the first after a lengthy hiatus.</TE>
<TE>   Speaking in Ramallah on Saturday, Arafat said he had authorized the
meeting with Sharon.</TE>
<TE>   "I have given my directions to continue with these meetings," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The secret meeting had the trappings of a Hollywood thriller,
political analyst Nahum Barnea wrote in the Yediot Aharonot newspaper.
"But unfortunately, very little happened between the movie's opening
sequence and its end: We drove, we ate, we drank, we talked, we drove."</TE>
<TE>   Sharon and Arafat, said Barnea, had a tactical interest in the meeting
before Sharon heads for Washington.</TE>

<HD>Queries on Islam? In Egypt, Just Call 1-900 Dial-a-Sheik</HD>
<DH>Mideast: A service answers questions at 20 cents a minute. Sex is a
frequent topic.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MICHAEL SLACKMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>CAIRO
</DL>
<LD>With all the confusion and controversy these days over Islam, Sheik
Khalid Gendy thinks he has hit on the perfect way to set the record
straight, emphasize his religion's message of peace--and make a tidy
profit.</LD>
<LD>   It might be called Dial-a-Sheik.</LD>
<LD>   Relying on technology more familiar in the West for providing adult
entertainment, Sheik Khalid and a partner are running a pay-per-call
"1-900" telephone service that is, they say, attracting as many as 1,000
inquiries a day. For about 20 cents a minute, callers can get a religious
opinion from one of about 15 respected Islamic authorities.</LD>
<TE>   "Perhaps we, the ones who are practicing Islam, are the ones to be
blamed for its [tarnished] reputation," said Cherif Abdel-meguid, the
sheik's partner in "Islamic Line."</TE>
<TE>   "Due to some people who 'mispractice' it, Islam is being blamed," he
added. "The problem is not in Islam. The mistake, perhaps, lies within
us."</TE>
<TE>   But the partners' lofty goal of setting the religious record straight
has, at least for the moment, taken a back seat to the everyday concerns
of Egypt's faithful. The phone line has become a kind of Islamic
confessional, a uniquely anonymous place where the embarrassed and
contrite can have their questions answered and their sins resolved.</TE>
<TE>   Questions about sex make up either 30% or 80% of calls, depending on
whom you ask.</TE>
<TE>   Listen to the first three calls that came in one morning last week:</TE>
<TE>   8:08: "I want to know if God or the prophet said I have to wear the
face cover or not, and the second thing is, what is the basis of marriage
in Islam? Is it sex only or much more than sex?"</TE>
<TE>   9:31: "I had sexual intercourse with my husband in [the holy month of]
Ramadan before [sundown, which is not permitted]. So I am seeking your
advice."</TE>
<TE>   9:35: "I swore by the name of God, and I was lying in what I was
saying. Please advise me what can I do? I know it was a big mistake."</TE>
<TE>   Islam dictates rules for virtually every aspect of a follower's life,
from the correct manner of prayer to the division of material goods after
death. Muslims who want a religious opinion, or fatwa, to guide their
behavior often turn to scholars or imams for answers. But until now that
involved a face-to-face encounter in a mosque or a direct phone
conversation.</TE>
<TE>A PIN Number to Enlightenment</TE>
<TE>   Enter computers, telephone answering systems and Sheik Khalid.</TE>
<TE>   Through the use of technology that came to Egypt about two years ago,
callers can leave a recorded message and receive a PIN number. They call
back in 24 hours, punch in their PIN and listen to the recorded reply.</TE>
<TE>   The sheik's line opened more than a year ago amid a flurry of 900
numbers that were created in the region. The new numbers generated such
outrageous phone bills, and such a public outcry, that the government
began to more strictly regulate the services. Lines offering everything
from jokes to horoscopes were suspended, while "Islamic Line" has been
permitted to grow.</TE>
<TE>   From the start, Abdel-meguid and the sheik agreed that only religious
scholars from Cairo's Al Azhar University would be permitted to offer
advice. They hoped to blend the benefits of technology with the prestige
associated with the recognized center of Islamic learning for Sunni
Muslims.</TE>
<TE>   If there has been anything surprising to the founders, it has been the
nature of the calls. According to Sheik Khalid, 70% of the callers are
women and four out of five questions are about sex. That changed a bit
after Sept. 11. He now receives more calls of a political nature, he
said, though matters of the flesh still dominate.</TE>
<TE>   Abdel-meguid estimates that 30% of the calls are about sex, but he was
surprised at the huge interest in issues related to breast-feeding.
Although Muslims are allowed to marry first cousins, people breast-fed by
the same woman cannot wed.</TE>
<TE>   "This is really a rampant question," Abdel-meguid said. "I did not
know there was so much breast-feeding going on that would hamper people
from getting married to each other."</TE>
<TE>Plans Include an Open Line for Americans</TE>
<TE>   Overall, the service has proved so successful that it has already been
expanded to Jordan, Yemen and the Palestinian territories, and plans are
in the works to launch the system in Kuwait. The partners also are
negotiating to open lines in Canada and the United States, which would
allow Americans to dial a stateside number and be connected with the
Cairo service. But the partners are finding U.S. corporations reluctant
in the wake of the Sept. 11 attacks.</TE>
<TE>   "We want to export moderate Islam," said Abdel-meguid. "This is a
nontraditional export. It's something [that], if available in the West,
will help to better clarify Islam to both Muslims and non-Muslims."</TE>
<TE>   Mark Sedgwick, a professor of modern Islam and Sufism at American
University in Cairo, said the interest in "Islamic Line" is not
surprising as it represents the accommodation of the centuries-old faith
to modern technology.</TE>
<TE>   "Whether it's the Internet or the dial-up fatwa, this is simply the
'technologization' of a very old established phenomenon," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Though popular in Egypt, the service is not without its critics. Some
have called it a shameful way to make a buck.</TE>
<TE>   "Giving a fatwa is a duty to the scholar, like praying and fasting,
and it is unacceptable for a scholar to trade with fatwas," said Yehia
Ismail, a professor of religious sciences at Al Azhar. "If the scholar
asked for money in return for the fatwa, he is a sinner."</TE>
<TE>   The partners, however, say they are not charging for the religious
opinion, but for the use of the technology and for the scholars' time.
Sheik Khalid views the business not as a sin but as a public service.</TE>
<TE>   For a fee of between $1 and $2, the service gave out this advice to
the morning callers last week:</TE>
<TE>   8:08: Covering a woman's face with a veil is not required, and
marriage should be about safety, love and mercy.</TE>
<TE>   9:31: For one day, the woman and her husband needed to fast and
abstain from sex.</TE>
<TE>   9:35: Pray to God for forgiveness, admit to the lie and remedy any
damage it might have caused.</TE>
<TE>   "If you want to go to heaven, paying five or 10 pounds is not too much
of a price," the sheik said. "Callers ask for advice to correct their
path from evil to righteous. We correct the path."</TE>

British soldiers killed 13 civil rights protesters.</LD>

<HD>Pakistan Police Say Dumped Body Is Not U.S. Reporter</HD>
<DH>Abduction: Investigators return to the assumption that Daniel Pearl
is still alive and expand their search for him.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GEOFFREY MOHAN</AU>
<AU>TYLER MARSHALL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>KARACHI, Pakistan
</DL>
<LD>In the latest twist to the already enigmatic case of kidnapped
American journalist Daniel Pearl, top police investigators rushed to a
hospital in this port city early today only to find that a body brought
there with a bullet wound in the head was not that of the U.S. reporter.</LD>
<LD>   The body had been dumped in an old quarter of the sprawling,
crime-ridden city and was brought to a public hospital, then transferred
to a private hospital in the upscale Clifton district.</LD>
<LD>   Summoned to the facility, investigators and close colleagues of Pearl
from the Wall Street Journal quickly ruled out the possibility that the
body was Pearl's, based on its smaller stature, darker complexion and
different teeth, according to Manzoor Mughal, senior superintendent of
police in Karachi.</LD>
<TE>   "It wasn't even a close match," U.S. Consulate spokesman Lonnie Kelley
said.</TE>
<TE>   The unidentified body was believed to be that of a foreign male,
possibly an Iranian, Mughal said.</TE>
<TE>   "The investigation into the kidnapping of Daniel Pearl is continuing,"
he said.</TE>
<TE>   "There was a threat that kidnappers were going to dump [Pearl's]
body," said Tariq Jamil, deputy superintendent of police in Karachi.
"That's why we take these reports seriously."</TE>
<TE>   The development marked the second time in three days that those
closest to the case feared that Pearl, who disappeared here Jan. 23,
might be dead. On Friday, Western news organizations received an
e-mail--at the time believed to be from the kidnappers--declaring that
Pearl had been killed and his body dumped in one of the city's
graveyards.</TE>
<TE>   As the latest scare passed early today, emotionally drained
investigators once again returned to the assumption that Pearl was still
alive, in a case that has now expanded to other major cities.</TE>
<TE>   Senior law enforcement authorities said Sunday that they have fully
discounted the e-mail received Friday, which at first seemed like a
credible death announcement.</TE>
<TE>   "We believe Mr. Pearl is alive," said Syed Kamel Shah, inspector
general of police for the region that includes Karachi. "We are making
headway in our investigation."</TE>
<TE>   Still, after searching hundreds of graveyards in the city three times,
seizing computers and rounding up suspects ranging from an Islamic cleric
to teenage pranksters, authorities remained mystified about the fate of
Pearl, the Journal's South Asia regional correspondent.</TE>
<TE>   On Sunday, they expanded their dragnet to the capital, Islamabad, and
its environs, where they made several raids and detained suspects for
questioning.</TE>
<TE>   Ten people were believed to be in police custody Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   A senior police source in the Islamabad area said that the search had
expanded to all of Pakistan, and particularly to the loosely governed
areas bordering Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   Pearl was last seen en route to what he believed was a meeting with
the leader of a shadowy extremist group.</TE>
<TE>   Most vexing to investigators, who now include a group from the FBI,
have been a spate of false e-mails and prank telephone calls for ransom
that led to at least two arrests over the weekend.</TE>
<TE>   A teenager in the northeastern city of Lahore was detained in
connection with four of the hoax e-mails and was scheduled to be
transferred to authorities in Karachi for further questioning. Two other
teens were detained along with their laptop computer in Karachi but were
released after extensive questioning and a scanning of the computer's
hard drive turned up no evidence of links to the kidnapping, according to
Shah.</TE>
<TE>   Another two suspects had been detained in Islamabad in connection with
two false ransom calls, according to a local police source.</TE>
<TE>   Despite discounting ransom calls, investigators are increasingly
operating under the assumption that the kidnap group--which dubbed itself
the National Movement for the Restoration of Pakistani Sovereignty--had
pecuniary, not political, motives, according to an intelligence source.</TE>
<TE>   American investigators have reportedly suggested to their Pakistani
counterparts that at least one kidnapper could be from an ethnic group
common in Punjab province, where the capital is located, the source said.
That analysis, he said, was based on clothing and body clues gleaned from
an e-mailed photograph that showed the man's arm and hand holding a
handgun to Pearl's head.</TE>
<TE>   The lack of a new photograph in Friday's e-mailed death announcement
led investigators to doubt its authenticity, as did the management of the
Wall Street Journal, which has urged the kidnappers to resume contact and
send a photograph of Pearl with a current newspaper to prove that he is
alive.</TE>
<TE>   The initial rambling and politically tinged messages from the group
contained photographs and demands that included the release of Pakistanis
being held at the U.S. naval base in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, as well as of
a former Taliban ambassador to Pakistan.</TE>
<TE>   One source close to the investigation in Karachi said authorities were
working on the assumption that if Pearl had been killed by hard-line
terrorists, they would have been eager to show evidence of their deed,
either via a photograph or by more clearly directing authorities toward
his body. The only hint in Friday's death note of where the body might be
was that it could be found in a graveyard in Karachi. But searches of the
city's 300-odd cemeteries late Friday and most of Saturday produced no
evidence of Pearl's fate.</TE>
<TE>   Pearl, 38, was investigating Pakistani connections to Richard C. Reid,
a British citizen accused of trying to ignite a shoe bomb on a
Paris-to-Miami flight in December. Pearl was attempting to contact Sheik
Mubarak Ali Shah Gilani, head of the fundamentalist Islamic group Jamaat
ul-Fuqra, about its possible ties with Reid, when he disappeared. Gilani
is no longer considered a suspect.</TE>
<TE>   Calls for Pearl's release have come from sources as varied as the U.S.
and Pakistani governments, Amnesty International, journalism groups,
former heavyweight champion Muhammad Ali, Nation of Islam leader Louis
Farrakhan and Yusuf Islam, formerly known as pop star Cat Stevens.</TE>

<DL>GARDEZ, Afghanistan
</DL>
<LD>Afghan and U.N. mediators, joined by U.S. officials, extracted a
conditional cease-fire agreement Sunday from two rival tribal warlords in
this eastern Afghan town that was rocked by two days of fighting last
week.</LD>
<LD>   With factional fighting threatening the national government's efforts
to assert control throughout the country, the delegation hopes to avert
more tribal clashes in Gardez, a town of about 40,000 that is the capital
of Paktia, a strategic border province. U.S. forces want to ensure that
Al Qaeda fugitives cannot flee through Paktia's border passes into
neighboring Pakistan.</LD>
<LD>   On Wednesday and Thursday, soldiers for warlord Bacha Khan exchanged
artillery fire with forces loyal to Gardez's tribal council, which
bitterly opposes Khan's appointment as provincial governor. At least 61
people were killed.</LD>
<TE>   Just before meeting the mediators, Khan said he was ready to fight on
to assert his rights as governor--an appointment that was initially
self-declared but was later sanctioned by the government of interim Prime
Minister Hamid Karzai.</TE>
<TE>   "I am officially the governor. . . . I am ready for more fighting,"
Khan said, gesturing toward 200 of his soldiers standing near a
mud-walled outpost outside of Gardez, where the delegation traveled to
meet him. "You can see my fighters."</TE>
<TE>   Tribal council leaders say Khan is corrupt and brutal and have
appealed for another governor.</TE>
<TE>   During a break in the talks, Khan said he had agreed to a request by
mediators to hold off until Friday on any new assault on Gardez, 60 miles
south of the Afghan capital, Kabul. But Khan said he would resume the
attack if he was not satisfied with the pace of prisoner exchanges and
return of the bodies of slain fighters.</TE>
<TE>   Mediation efforts were to continue today.</TE>
<TE>   Townspeople said U.S. aircraft dropped leaflets Saturday night urging
an end to the fighting, the worst clashes between rival warlords since
Karzai's government took office in late December.</TE>
<TE>   "We are all in Afghanistan," the leaflets said in Dari and Pashto, the
two local languages. "We must be united and one together."</TE>
<TE>--- UNPUBLISHED NOTE ---</TE>
<TE>Beginning in stories published in 2006, the Afghan warlord Bacha Khan is
identified as Pacha Khan Zadran. (Second reference is "Pacha Khan.")</TE>

<DL>PHILADELPHIA
</DL>
<LD>The Justice Department asked the American Bar Assn. to delay taking
a stand on the use of military tribunals for terrorism trials until the
government finalizes rules governing such panels, the legal group said
Sunday.</LD>
<LD>   However, the bar association's policy-making body still was expected
to vote as early as today on a proposal recommending adoption of
regulations aimed at ensuring the fairness of such proceedings, which
could be held in private and provide fewer rights to defendants.</LD>
<LD>   President Bush's order authorizing the use of military tribunals has
been widely criticized by a number of lawyers speaking at panels during
the ABA's midyear meeting here.</LD>
<TE>   Robert Clifford, a Chicago lawyer who heads the ABA Task Force on
Terrorism, said he could only speculate that the Bush administration
would not be happy with the ABA advocating a role for Congress and the
judiciary in the operation of the military tribunals. While the ABA has
no enforcement power, the views of its 400,000 members can be
influential.</TE>

<HD>U.S. Defends Terrorism War to Wary Allies as a Righteous Fight</HD>
<DH>Meeting: An American lawmaker at a German security conference warns
of a 'theological iron curtain' forming in the Muslim world.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CAROL J. WILLIAMS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>MUNICH, Germany
</DL>
<LD>Addressing European allies' concerns that the war against terrorism
lacks legal legitimacy, U.S. officials claimed Sunday to be waging an
irreproachable battle of good against evil.</LD>
<LD>   At the conclusion of a two-day security brainstorming session here
that exposed deep rifts between Washington and its European partners,
Sen. Joseph I. Lieberman likened the campaign to the righteous struggles
in the last century against fascism and totalitarian rule.</LD>
<LD>   Amending Winston Churchill's famous statement, the Connecticut
Democrat warned delegates to the 38th Munich Conference on Security
Policy that Islamic fanatics are creating a "theological iron curtain" to
isolate moderate Muslims from the democratic world. He also invoked the
words of the prophet Muhammad in predicting that the "moral force" of the
West's war effort will ensure its success.</LD>
<TE>   Lieberman's appeal to U.S. allies to "be firm and unequivocal in
pursuing and preempting other terrorist groups" echoed the hawkish
patriotism espoused by Republicans at the gathering. Showing a united,
bipartisan front, U.S. representatives stood their ground against a
barrage of courteous but clear European objections to hints that the war
could soon spread to countries in an "axis of evil."</TE>
<TE>   Russian Defense Minister Sergei B. Ivanov accused Washington of
employing a double standard in branding those who assault Americans and
their property "terrorists" while refusing to apply the same label to
separatists from the rebel republic of Chechnya, who are accused of
blowing up apartment buildings in Moscow.</TE>
<TE>   Contending that the war against terrorism cannot be won by military
means alone, Ivanov, a former Kremlin national security advisor, insisted
that "any actions taken by the states and international organizations
against terrorists, including the use of force, should be based on norms
and principles of international law."</TE>
<TE>   U.N. and European human rights advocates have called upon Washington
to respect the Geneva Conventions on the treatment of prisoners of war in
its handling of Taliban and Al Qaeda fighters captured in Afghanistan.
The Bush administration has refused to label those held at a special U.S.
detention facility in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, as prisoners of war, while
insisting that they are being treated humanely.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S.-led coalition fighting global terrorism also needs to be more
precise in identifying its targets, Ivanov said.</TE>
<TE>   "To our regret, [the coalition] . . . has failed to elaborate a
generally recognized legal definition of international terrorism," he
said. "As you may know, it complicates the introduction of an
international legal basis for agreement on a framework to effectively
counter the threat on a collective basis."</TE>
<TE>   German lawmaker Markus Meckel also expressed discomfort with the lack
of clear international legitimacy for the anti-terror campaign and
pointed out that Washington's refusal to submit to decisions of the
International Court of Justice in The Hague compounds the legitimacy
problem.</TE>
<TE>   Existing treaties and conventions govern only wars declared against
sovereign countries, not transnational developments such as terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   But the U.S. participants at the annual conference, which brings
together strategists and officials from dozens of countries, appeared
more interested in explaining their plans than consulting on the
specifics. On Saturday, Deputy Defense Secretary Paul D. Wolfowitz and
former Republican presidential contender Sen. John McCain of Arizona
signaled the Pentagon's interest in seizing the moment and making a
preemptive strike against Iraq to prevent its development and use of
nuclear, chemical or biological weapons.</TE>
<TE>   Lieberman agreed that the coalition needs to "decisively address the
profound threat posed by Saddam Hussein and his weapons of mass
destruction" and suggested that to do so would bolster the moderate
majority in the Islamic world that is under attack by Muslim fanatics.</TE>
<TE>   "If the wrong side should win this civil war, the new theological iron
curtain that would fall would imprison behind it hundreds of millions of
people, just as the old iron curtain did," Lieberman insisted.</TE>
<TE>   He urged the anti-terror alliance, however, to combine military
targeting of the extremists with support for the majority that wants to
embrace democracy, not wage a holy war against it.</TE>
<TE>   While cautioning U.S. leaders to avoid having to resort to unilateral
actions in the effort to destroy the forces behind the Sept. 11 terrorist
attacks, Lieberman and others also criticized the widening gap in
military capabilities between Washington and its European and Canadian
allies.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. partners in the 19-nation North Atlantic Treaty Organization
sorely need to modernize their armed forces if they want to have any
influence in mission planning and execution, NATO Secretary-General
George Robertson warned, conceding that "the truth is that Europe remains
militarily undersized."</TE>

<HD>A Gaggle of Quackery Going Mainstream</HD>
<DH>Gadgetry: Questionable Devices museum closes, sending its
Immortality Ring, Xervac hair-growth pump and other oddities to 'serious'
science venue.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEPHANIE SIMON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>MINNEAPOLIS
</DL>
<LD>Feeling run-down? A bit saggy of spirit? Step right up to the
Orgone Energy Accumulator. It looks like a coffin, but it's filled with
pure energy. Sit inside and soak up vigor.</LD>
<LD>   Men, does your sex life need a boost? Give this prostate gland warmer
a try. Women, desperate to expand your bust? Try these suction cups--in
such a pretty shade of pink.</LD>
<LD>   Or maybe you're suffering from varicose veins? Arthritis? Kidney
trouble? Spit on a piece of paper. Slip it into this box. Adjust the
dials, and zap--it will send out healthful vibrations that will have you
cured by breakfast.</LD>
<TE>   All this and more was available until Jan. 27 at the Museum of
Questionable Devices, a screwball collection that proved the maxim, "If
it looks too good to be true, it is." (And suggested a corollary: You can
make a mint selling it just the same.)</TE>
<TE>Time to Go</TE>
<TE>   Museum founder Bob McCoy packed up his quackery hall of fame last
week, saying it was time to retire (at age 75) after nearly two decades
of devotion to the scam. But if you need a spin in the MacGregor
Rejuvenator, fear not. McCoy has donated 325 of his best frauds to the
Science Museum of Minnesota in St. Paul.</TE>
<TE>   That means the magnetic Immortality Ring and the Crosley Xervac vacuum
pump for hair growth soon will go on display in a museum of "serious"
science.</TE>
<TE>   And serious scientists are delighted.</TE>
<TE>   For, while the bogus cures always are good for a chuckle (or a wince,
in the case of the rectal dilators), the collection has a sober message
as well: Be skeptical. Question authority. Think.</TE>
<TE>   It's easy to make fun of a machine that purported to cure most any
illness by vibrating the air. But thousands fell for the Coetherator in
the 1930s. In 1976, about 4 million women bought the foot-powered breast
enlarger. And today, millions more are falling for other "treatments"
every bit as worthless.</TE>
<TE>   Just last month, an Iowa judge blocked sales of a machine touted to
regenerate breast tissue. Oregon recently cracked down on claims that an
"electro-dermal" device could detect food allergies by probing for
imbalances in a patient's "electromagnetic flow." As for the Immortality
Rings--"believed to stop aging permanently!!!"--they're still on sale
through the Internet, at $25 a pair.</TE>
<TE>   "The fact is, [quack devices] are a really serious problem," said Dr.
Stephen Barrett, who crusades to expose such fraud through his Web site,
http://www.quackwatch.com. "People fall for them all the time, and
there's very little protection."</TE>
<TE>   Or, as McCoy puts it: "You know that phrase, there's a sucker born
every minute? Well, there's a crook born every hour to take advantage of
those suckers."</TE>
<TE>   But it's not money alone that's at stake.</TE>
<TE>   The most wrenching exhibit in McCoy's collection may well be the
Tricho Machine, circa 1925. The device used X-rays to remove "superfluous
hair," and young women flocked to beauty salons to try it. Many returned
for dozens of treatments--only to suffer, in later years, from
debilitating ulcers, receding gums and cancer.</TE>
<TE>   Like many of the "miracle" machines in the collection, the Tricho
played off a genuine medical advance: the discovery of X-rays. Consumers
then, as now, knew that the latest scientific finds were being harnessed
to improve health care. So they had little reason to question some of the
outlandish claims made by quacks.</TE>
<TE>   If an invisible X-ray could see through skin and diagnose internal
injuries, why should they doubt that a "violet ray" treatment would
eliminate freckles and redistribute fat? Or that an "ozone generator"
could cure a torn tendon with glass tubes that lit up neon-bright?</TE>
<TE>   When transistor radios were all the rage, AM radio waves were touted
as a marvelous cure. When radium was discovered, quacks invented
radioactive aphrodisiacs and gamma ray fountains of youth. When aerobic
exercise took off in the 1980s, out came "aerobic eye exercise glasses"
to improve vision.</TE>
<TE>A Wacky History</TE>
<TE>   "The whole history of science is embodied in these wacky devices,"
said Anne Hornickel, an executive at the Science Museum of Minnesota.
"They tell an amazing story."</TE>
<TE>   Hornickel and her colleagues are working on how to integrate that
story into the Science Museum. In some cases, McCoy's devices will take
their place alongside existing displays.</TE>
<TE>   The human body exhibit, for instance, may host McCoy's foot X-ray
machine, used in shoe stores in the 1950s to guarantee a perfect fit. And
the gallery that deals with light waves will be a natural for the
Specto-Chrome, a box that flashed colored lights on a nude patient to
"cure" 200 diseases, including bubonic plague and anthrax. (The
machine--little more than color filters and a light bulb--earned its
inventor more than $1 million in the 1930s.)</TE>
<TE>   Other devices might become interactive exhibits. Visitors might test
the vibrating bed, designed to straighten curved spines. And McCoy
already has taught museum staff members how to operate the antique
"psychograph," a contraption that looks like a cross between a postmodern
chandelier and a medieval torture device. The machine deduces a patient's
personality from reading the bumps on the head, then suggests suitable
careers, from actor to zeppelin attendant.</TE>
<TE>Quackery Connoisseur</TE>
<TE>   The psychograph was one of McCoy's first questionable devices; a
friend gave it to him in the 1970s. Always interested in uncovering
deceptions (he founded the Minnesota Skeptics Assn. to do just that),
McCoy soon became a connoisseur of quackery.</TE>
<TE>   He found some devices at estate sales. Others were sent by strangers
as word of his curious collection spread. The U.S. Food and Drug
Administration and the American Medical Assn. each scoured their
warehouses for sham devices to lend McCoy. Medical historians also
provided thousands of documents, from breathless advertisements to
newspaper exposes to government posters warning that certain devices
could be dangerous. (McCoy has collected them all in a recent book called
"Quack! Tales of Medical Fraud From the Museum of Questionable Medical
Devices.")</TE>
<TE>   However the Science Museum uses the collection, McCoy's supporters
hope it will be appreciated as more than just a gag.</TE>
<TE>   "People want to believe in technology. They want to have trust in
health-care professionals," said Dr. Robert S. Baratz, president of the
private National Council Against Health Fraud. "The value of this type of
museum is to point out that sometimes these things are frauds."</TE>

<LD>It's time for schools serving poor children to stand and deliver.</LD>
<LD>   For years, educators and their political allies have complained that
Washington did not invest enough money in Title I, the massive federal
program that provides extra funds for public schools in poor
neighborhoods.</LD>
<LD>   But Title I grew steadily under former President Clinton, and it's
thriving under President Bush. In 2002, Bush and Congress hiked the
program's budget by $1.6 billion to $10.35 billion, making it by far the
largest federal education program. Bush has already requested another
$1-billion increase for 2003, making Title I one of the few domestic
winners in the budget he'll release today.</LD>
<TE>   At the same time, the education reform bill Bush just signed into law
targets the available funds more precisely on the neediest districts.
Between more money and better targeting, Los Angeles could see its Title
I grant jump by nearly 40% to almost $300 million; San Diego anticipates
a 30% increase. Other big cities may see comparable windfalls.</TE>
<TE>   Which makes this a very good time to ask how well schools are spending
the money.</TE>
<TE>   That's not a question many educators and administrators have liked to
discuss. Partly because of byzantine federal rules meant to assure the
money is actually spent on kids from low-income families, the programs in
many districts have become secretive "fiefdoms" under the control of
Title I administrators operating without much oversight from
superintendents and school boards, says Kati Haycock, director of the
Education Trust, a group that advocates for students from low-income
households. "These are huge kingdoms or queendoms," she says.</TE>
<TE>   In many places, districts haven't established a clear plan for
spending the money, leaving individual principals on their own. Often
they have utterly no idea how to effectively deploy the funds. "A lot of
time people just don't know what to do to improve achievement," says
Phyllis McClure, a consultant for high-poverty school districts.</TE>
<TE>   The result typically has been not much different from throwing the
money against a wall and hoping it sticks. Until recent reforms in San
Diego, the district didn't even know how schools were spending the money,
says Mary Hopper, the deputy chancellor for instruction. When Roy Romer
arrived as Los Angeles' superintendent, he found "quite often there was
not a clear strategy as to how to use Title I. It was, 'Where are we
short on our budget? Let's use Title I money.' "</TE>
<TE>   In the absence of any stronger direction, the Title I money--like so
much else in big-city education--has flowed more toward the needs of
adults than of children. "In many places," says McClure, "Title I has
been thought of more as an adult employment program than an education
program."</TE>
<TE>   Many districts have used big chunks of their Title I grants to hire
paraprofessional teacher aides, many of them mothers from the local
community. Though most are committed and work hard, few of these aides
have much qualification: A recent federal survey found that in the
elementary schools with the highest degree of poverty, only one in every
10 teacher aides had a four-year college degree. (In all Title I schools,
the figure was just one in five.) Yet, nationally, schools spend over
$1.1 billion in Title I money to hire paraprofessionals; the Education
Department says schools nationwide have hired slightly more teacher aides
than teachers with their Title I funds.</TE>
<TE>   It gets worse. Most paraprofessionals report receiving less than two
days of training. Yet in highest-poverty schools--the schools where
students typically need the most help--nearly half of the aides report
they have taught classes without a teacher present. And while districts
have spent heavily on the teacher aides, they've stinted on other
services that could help struggling students. Only about one in nine
students in Title I schools attend extended-day programs. And Title I
schools are spending only one-fifth as much training teachers as they are
paying for the teacher aides.</TE>
<TE>   The good news is that a reform movement is budding from the bottom up.
In cities from El Paso to Providence, R.I., courageous administrators are
seizing control of the Title I money and shifting its focus from
providing jobs to helping kids. Two Southern California districts are at
the forefront of the movement.</TE>
<TE>   In San Diego, Supt. Alan Bersin and Chancellor of Instruction Anthony
Alvarado laid off 600 teacher aides in 2000 (offering them other jobs in
the system). The district then redirected the money into extended-day
services, summer school and, most important, a coaching program that
provides intensive, in-classroom training for teachers. In 1998, the
district spent $1 million annually training teachers; now the number is
$60 million.</TE>
<TE>   In Los Angeles, which had been among the worst offenders in
overemphasizing the aides, Romer is taking a similar tack, shifting money
into hundreds of coaches who teach teachers how to teach reading and
math. "What happens is Title I money is quite often spent on the edges,"
he says. "The real crucial thing here is you have to improve instruction
and improve what happens in the classroom."</TE>
<TE>   None of this is easy. In San Diego, Bersin and Alvarado have faced
virtually scorched-earth resistance from teachers' unions and some
community groups to their elimination of the aides. "The feelings still
are strong about this," Hopper says. "It's very difficult, and I'm not
surprised that more . . . people haven't tried it."</TE>
<TE>   Yet around the country more districts may have no choice but to follow
their lead. The new federal education bill establishes clear mandates for
all schools to improve student performance; those that don't will face
escalating sanctions, including mandates that they divert Title I money
into a program that will allow parents to purchase after-school tutoring
from private companies. Eventually, failing schools face the dismissal of
their leadership. That should concentrate the mind.</TE>
<TE>   No one should minimize the challenge facing schools trying to help
low-income students coping with chaotic neighborhoods and, too often,
chaotic situations at home. It's fair for schools to protest that they
can't solve all these problems alone. But it's equally fair for society
to demand that schools place no other priority above helping kids. And
using Title I as a local patronage program fails that fundamental test.</TE>

<LD>The American Academy of Pediatrics has endorsed homosexual
adoption, saying gay couples can provide the loving, stable, emotionally
healthy family life children need.</LD>
<LD>   The policy focuses specifically on gaining legally protected parental
rights for gay "co-parents" whose partners have children, but also could
apply to gay couples who want to adopt, said Dr. Joseph Hagan Jr.,
chairman of the policy committee.</LD>
<LD>   Citing estimates suggesting that as many as 9 million U.S. children
have at least one gay parent, the academy urged its 55,000 members to
actively support measures that allow gay adoption.</LD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Babies who gain weight very rapidly during their first four months
may be prone to obesity, research suggests.</LD>
<LD>   Regardless of weight at birth and age 1, such infants were
significantly more likely to be overweight at age 7 than babies who
gained weight more slowly in the first four months.</LD>
<LD>   The study involving 19,397 children supports the idea that obesity is
hereditary. But it also suggests that prevention efforts targeting early
infancy, such as breast-feeding, might help counteract genetics, said Dr.
Nicolas Stettler of The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia.</LD>

<LD>The Bush administration has discovered a way to eliminate the

<LD>   In an embarrassing blunder, White House budget officials discovered
that a number of the tables in the budget that will be released today
failed to include minus signs to indicate the budget deficits.</LD>
<LD>   Trent Duffy, a spokesman for the Office of Management and Budget, said
the tables were fine when they went to the printer but somehow the minus
signs disappeared because of a "software conversion glitch." He said the

<HD>CFO's Deals Detailed by Enron</HD>
<DH>Probe: Andrew Fastow headed partnerships in which the energy firm's
representatives were his own subordinates, panel's report shows.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEFF LEEDS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>HOUSTON
</DL>
<LD>At least 13 times in the last three years, private partnerships
headed by Enron Corp.'s chief financial officer cut deals with the energy
giant in which the executives representing Enron were his own
subordinates.</LD>
<LD>   These arrangements by ousted CFO Andrew S. Fastow created a jungle of
conflicts of interest in Enron's executive suites and were a key factor
in the financial problems leading to the company's Dec. 2 Chapter 11
bankruptcy filing, according to findings of the special Enron panel that
examined the partnerships.</LD>
<LD>   The report, released Saturday, provides a wide-ranging indictment of
the company's management and financial practices. Much of the focus is on
Fastow, however, as it offers the most detailed account yet of the
off-the-books partnerships he oversaw.</LD>
<TE>   "The transactions between Enron and the [Fastow] partnerships resulted
in Enron increasing its reported financial results by more than a billion
dollars, and enriching Fastow and his co-investors by tens of millions of
dollars at Enron's expense," said the report, released this weekend.</TE>
<TE>   Enron's internal investigation alleges that Fastow, a former banking
executive who became Enron's CFO four years ago at age 36, raided the
energy giant from the inside, exposing his employer to deepening risk
while orchestrating side deals that paid him at least $30 million.</TE>
<TE>   "Fastow, as CFO, knew what assets Enron's business units wanted to
sell, how badly and how soon they wanted to sell them and whether they
had alternate buyers," the report said. "He was in a position to exert
great pressure and influence, directly or indirectly, on Enron personnel
who were negotiating" with the entities in which he had a personal
financial stake.</TE>
<TE>   Gordon Andrew, a spokesman for Fastow, declined to comment.</TE>
<TE>   The 203-page report was written by a three-member panel led by William
Powers, the University of Texas Law School dean appointed to the Enron
board specifically to conduct the inquiry.</TE>
<TE>   Enron had turned to Fastow in the late 1990s to devise a strategy that
would allow the energy giant to keep investing in new businesses while
keeping the company's credit ratings strong.</TE>
<TE>   Fastow responded by increasing Enron's use of so-called
special-purpose vehicles--corporate entities that can be used to absorb
gains and losses as long as they are controlled and partially owned by
outside investors.</TE>
<TE>   Enron had used such financing at least once before, cutting a
joint-venture deal with the California Public Employees' Retirement
System. But Fastow added a twist--he proposed that Enron engage in deals
with an ostensibly independent entity run by one of Enron's own
executives.</TE>
<TE>   The technique worked for a time. By moving assets and liabilities off
its books, Enron was able to inflate its profit and credit
rating--fueling its swift ascent on Wall Street and pumping up the value
of its executives' stock options.</TE>
<TE>   But amid increased scrutiny last year, Enron decided that many of the
outside entities weren't truly independent. On Oct. 16, it was forced to
disclose a $1.2-billion drop in shareholder equity, and the resulting
decline in its credit ratings led the company to file for bankruptcy
protection.</TE>
<TE>   Much of the problem arose from three partnerships engineered or
partially owned by Fastow.</TE>
<TE>Chewco Investments</TE>
<TE>   Fastow's first such off-the-books design for Enron was Chewco
Investments--named for the Chewbacca character in the "Star Wars" films.
He planned to use Chewco, financed with bank loans, to buy out the
California pension system's share of a joint venture that Enron wanted to
keep off its books.</TE>
<TE>   But the venture was hardly independent, the report found: The bank
loans used to fund it were guaranteed by Enron, and initially, Fastow
planned to manage it himself while continuing as Enron's CFO.</TE>
<TE>   Fastow told employees that Enron's then-president and his mentor,
Jeffrey K. Skilling, had approved of his participation in Chewco as long
as it didn't have to be disclosed in Enron's regulatory filings, the
internal probe found.</TE>
<TE>   When Enron's in-house lawyers told him his involvement would have to
be disclosed, Fastow substituted one of his lieutenants, Michael Kopper,
to run the partnership.</TE>
<TE>   Although Chewco "apparently required little management" aside from
preparing unaudited financial statements for internal use, Kopper
received about $2 million in fees, the report said. During certain
periods of Chewco's existence, these management tasks "appear to have
been performed by Fastow's wife," the report said.</TE>
<TE>LJM Cayman</TE>
<TE>   Chewco was just the start of Fastow's deal making. In June 1999, he
formed a partnership called LJM, with the letters representing the first
initials of the names of his wife and two children.</TE>
<TE>   Fastow formed LJM Cayman to shield Enron from possible losses from its
$10-million investment in a start-up Internet service provider called
Rhythm NetConnections Inc.</TE>
<TE>   As part of the plan, Fastow told Enron's board that he would serve as
the general partner of LJM Cayman and would invest $1 million of his own
money. In return, he would be paid fees including 100% of the proceeds of
the sale of any assets until he had reached a rate of return of 25%. But
he said he would not receive any gains from increases in the price of
Enron stock paid to LJM Cayman.</TE>
<TE>   The board approved the arrangement, waiving Fastow's potential
conflict of interest.</TE>
<TE>   In a complex swap, Enron moved the risk from the Internet company to
LJM Cayman in exchange for more than $170 million in paper increases on
Enron stock locked up in a contract with an outside investment bank.</TE>
<TE>   Enron in early 2000 decided to sell the Rhythm shares and had to
unwind the deal with LJM. Fastow negotiated the deal with Enron's chief
accounting officer, Richard Causey--another potential conflict.</TE>
<TE>   An executive who has been interviewed by congressional investigators
said Causey "was intimidated by Andy and didn't think it was his role" to
haggle with him.</TE>
<TE>   Causey could not be reached for comment.</TE>
<TE>   According to the calculations of the board investigators, the final
deal resulted in Enron giving up options and cash worth $70 million more
than the restricted shares it received.</TE>
<TE>   The transaction also exposed another potential conflict. In March
2000, Fastow had allowed a handful of Enron executives to participate in
LJM Cayman. These executives--who included Fastow and Kopper--signed an
agreement to form an entity called Southampton Place, which acquired a
stake in LJM Cayman.</TE>
<TE>   The deal enabled a Fastow family foundation to receive $4.5 million
about two months after Fastow made an initial investment of $25,000. Two
other employees who each invested about $5,800 received about $1 million
each in the same period.</TE>
<TE>   The special committee found that Fastow's financial stake was
inconsistent with his representation to Enron's board that he wouldn't
receive any value from Enron stock involved in the LJM Cayman
transaction.</TE>
<TE>   The panel also found that at least two of the executives who received
windfalls from LJM Cayman were representing Enron at the time in
transactions with another Fastow-created entity.</TE>
<TE>LJM2 Co-Investment</TE>
<TE>   In October 1999, Fastow engineered the creation of another, far larger
entity called LJM2 Co-Investment. Again, he would serve as the entity's
general partner while maintaining his post as Enron's chief financial
officer. The plan was to raise money from outside investors and purchase
assets from Enron and enable the energy giant to remove debt from its
books.</TE>
<TE>   To raise funds, LJM2 sent an offering memorandum to potential
investors. In an usual move, the document emphasized Fastow's position as
Enron CFO, noting that LJM2 would have access to "investment
opportunities that would not be available otherwise to outside
investors." Critics say it is improper for Fastow to dangle the
possibility of using inside information for investors' benefit.</TE>
<TE>   The report said the deals often took place under terms that were
"remarkably favorable" to LJM2 while serving no apparent business purpose
for Enron. For example, in one of the deals, Enron agreed that an LJM2
affiliate wouldn't have to start absorbing Enron losses until the
Fastow-controlled LJM2 received an initial return of $41 million, or 30%,
on its initial $30-million investment.</TE>
<TE>   The report concluded that the troubles created by Fastow's
partnerships would have come to light far sooner if the board itself had
exercised closer oversight.</TE>

<HD>150 Arrested at World Economic Forum</HD>
<DH>Meeting: Only about 7,000 protesters showed up in NYC. They were
met by 4,000 police.</DH>

<DL>NEW YORK
</DL>
<LD>More than 150 demonstrators were arrested Sunday as protests at the
World Economic Forum continued for the fourth consecutive day. But police
far outnumbered protesters, and the streets remained free of violence.</LD>
<LD>   In the most boisterous demonstration, 87 people were taken into
custody for blocking traffic in lower Manhattan, said police spokesman
Lt. Brian Burke. Later, police broke up a march of more than 200 members
of the Earth and Animal Liberation Fronts, some of whom broke a glass
door and hurled a red-paint-filled balloon at an East Side apartment
building.</LD>
<LD>   The march was halted about a mile from the forum, and police arrested
67 additional protesters who lay down in the intersection of 60th Street
and Third Avenue. Traffic on the busy thoroughfare was tied up for an
hour.</LD>
<TE>   The police presence dominated and in some cases overwhelmed the
protests Saturday and Sunday, with more than 4,000 officers monitoring
the crowds. Police Commissioner Ray Kelly, responding to criticism from
some protest organizers, said the city was simply "taking every
precaution" to guard against any disruptions during the forum's five-day
proceedings.</TE>
<TE>   Overall, Saturday's protester turnout--estimated at 7,000--was
significantly smaller than the 100,000 who flocked to previous forum
meetings in Genoa, Italy, and the 50,000 who showed up in Seattle.</TE>
<TE>   Protesters said there were significant differences between those
meetings, which included violent clashes with police, and the New York
event.</TE>
<TE>   "We are here to show maximum sensitivity for what happened to this
city on Sept. 11," said Jim Thornton, who came from the Pacific Northwest
to protest the forum. "Nobody wanted to provoke the New York police, but
we had a right to show our concerns about globalism. And that's why we
oppose so much of what the World Economic Forum stands for."</TE>
<TE>   Protest organizers conceded that the police had gone to great lengths
to permit demonstrations within several blocks of the Waldorf-Astoria
Hotel, where the forum meetings took place. In other cities, police kept
marchers miles away from the site, inflaming tensions.</TE>
<TE>   Inside the forum itself, some 2,700 members on Sunday focused on
problems of the Middle East and the search for peace in Northern Ireland.</TE>
<TE>   Israeli Foreign Minister Shimon Peres said he saw "a ray of hope" for
Mideast peace, even as violence and pessimism in the region continues to
escalate. He based his beliefs on new indications from Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat that his forces may finally decide to put an end to
terrorist attacks in Israel.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, David Trimble, leader of Northern Ireland's power-sharing
government, was heartened that militants are being disarmed and said,
"One wants to see it continue."</TE>
<TE>   Gerry Adams, leader of Sinn Fein, the political party linked to the
Irish Republican Army, said he believes most residents of Northern
Ireland "are pleased with the progress we've made thus far."</TE>

<HD>No-Frills Mozart Strikes Pleasing Notes</HD>
<DH>In Irvine, Ami Porat's orchestra delivers solid performances in a
classically balanced program.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JACK ROBINSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The charming thing about Ami Porat's Mozart Classical Orchestra is
its focus and simplicity. This is an ensemble that has a mission and
performs it without frills or marketing tricks.</LD>
<LD>   At the Irvine Barclay Theatre on Friday, the Orange County-based
chamber orchestra offered a megadose of Mozart--a classically balanced
program of overture, concerto and symphony--with characteristically
solid, pleasing performances.</LD>
<LD>   The best music of the night was in the second half: Mozart's Symphony
No. 35 in D, the "Haffner." Like Beethoven's Fifth, this work suffers
from over-familiarity. We know it so well that we may forget to listen.</LD>
<TE>   But it's often programmed for a reason: This symphony is brimming with
good tunes.</TE>
<TE>   In the first movement, the violins were buoyant and fluid from the
start, dashing through the opening runs and trills. Rhythmic ensemble was
impeccable in the stately second movement, with players closely locked
into a long, slow pulse. And the final allegro was both clean and
dramatic, with dynamic contrasts carefully executed.</TE>
<TE>   The orchestra was just as trim, if perhaps a bit more tentative, in
the first work of the evening, the overture to Mozart's "Abduction From
the Seraglio." This famously energetic opener--"I doubt whether anyone .
. . could go to sleep over it," Mozart wrote his father as he was
composing it--was perfectly in place, though a bit stiff.</TE>
<TE>   Sara Andon, featured in the middle work of the concert, provided a
lovely performance of Mozart's Flute Concerto in D--a work that shouldn't
be half as successful as it is. Not only did Mozart dislike the
instrument, but he also whipped up this concerto in a hurry by rewriting
an earlier oboe concerto to fill a commission.</TE>
<TE>   Andon was most effective in the slow movement, where she was lyrical
and her tone lustrous. In the quicker first and third movements, she was
often covered by the orchestra and once or twice let the fast notes get
ahead of her fingers.</TE>
<TE>   Porat, the conductor, was a model of restraint: Apart from expansive
gestures in more sweeping passages and a neat little bow to the audience,
he engaged in none of the stage theatrics favored by many conductors.</TE>
<TE>   He graciously shared applause with the players, asking principals to
acknowledge the audience.</TE>
<TE>   And, best of all, he didn't talk.</TE>
<TE>   Apart from introducing the encore--itself a restrained choice, a
repeat of the last movement of the symphony--he let the music say all
that needed to be said.</TE>
