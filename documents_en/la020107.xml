<HD>Somalia: Terrorists' Next Stop?</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LAWRENCE J. KORB</AU>
<BD>Lawrence J. Korb, director of studies at the Council
on Foreign Relations, served as assistant secretary of Defense in the
Reagan administration.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As President Bush and his national security team have constantly
reminded us, the U.S. is not at war with individual nations but with
terrorists and the governments that support them. This is why we
attacked the Taliban in Afghanistan and why we will probably use
military force in Somalia.</LD>
<LD>   In fact, small numbers of U.S. special operations forces have
visited Somalia, and U.S. patrol planes and British and French
aircraft are flying reconnaissance missions over the area looking for
terrorists' camps and other indications of terrorist activity.</LD>
<LD>   For Americans, the thought of sending U.S. military people into
Somalia no doubt will conjure up horrible images of Mogadishu on Oct.
3, 1993. On that day, 18 U.S. Rangers were killed, 75 more were
wounded and dead Americans were dragged through the streets during an
unsuccessful attempt to capture Somalian warlord Gen. Mohammed Farah
Aidid. Public reaction to this event forced President Clinton to pull
out U.S. forces, and the subsequent withdrawal of the U.N. allowed
Somalia to fall back into the chaos that led the elder George Bush to
send American troops there in the first place.</LD>
<TE>   Aidid himself was killed by a rival faction in the summer of 1996.
Even today, there is no true national government. The so-called
transitional national government controls only part of Mogadishu--the
capital--with the remainder of the country divided up among dozens of
warlords.</TE>
<TE>   This chaotic atmosphere has been fertile ground for Al Qaeda and
other terrorist groups. In fact, there is evidence that Osama bin
Laden supported groups that aided Aidid in 1993, and that Somalia was
the launching pad for the bombings of the U.S. embassies in Kenya and
Tanzania in 1998. Al Qaeda claimed credit for the Oct. 3, 1993,
killings of the U.S. Rangers.</TE>
<TE>   And, with Al Qaeda on the run from Afghanistan and countries like
Yemen, Egypt and Sudan cracking down on terrorists, Somalia would be
a likely refuge for members of the Al Qaeda network.</TE>
<TE>   If the U.S. is to be as successful in Somalia as it has been in
Afghanistan, it must keep in mind several lessons from that
experience.</TE>
<TE>   First, some local warlords will attempt to use U.S. intervention
to further their own interests rather than crack down on terrorists.
Many of these warlords have accused the transitional government of
supporting terrorism and have urged the U.S. to destroy that
government.</TE>
<TE>   Second, the U.S. also must be wary of helping the states that
surround Somalia that are inclined to use our interest for their own
purposes. Ethiopia, the strongest U.S. ally in the region and a
strong supporter of U.S. involvement, has a historical fear of a
strong Somalia and actively supports and controls the warlords in the
south of Somalia. In December, Ethiopia refused to allow its warlords
to attend a Somalia-sponsored conference designed to broker a
power-sharing arrangement for the country.</TE>
<TE>   Third, if the U.S. does intervene militarily in Somalia, it cannot
leave quickly. A quick military attack followed by a hasty withdrawal
would make things worse and create a fertile environment for future
terrorists. The humanitarian situation there is already dire. Some
300,000 Somalis in the southern part of the country face starvation
because of a drought.</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, because of U.S. suspicions that it has helped finance Al
Qaeda, the assets of Al Barakaat, the country's largest bank, have
been frozen.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, U.S. military intervention must be quite modest, and done
in cooperation with other nations, particularly African countries.
The so-called Islamic Unity terrorist group, which has been supported
by Bin Laden, is not very formidable. It has only 2,000 hard-core
supporters and is equipped with only small arms. They have been
joined by less than 100 Al Qaeda terrorists fleeing Afghanistan.
Moreover, to the extent that it can work with local tribes and
warlords, the U.S. not only limits the risks to its own troops but
also avoids evoking memories of the 1992-93 intervention of some
30,000 U.S. troops.</TE>
<TE>   If the U.S. keeps these points in mind, it will be able to
continue to make progress in the war against terrorism, and it will
finish the work it left undone eight years ago, i.e., creating a
stable government that can deal with Somalia's humanitarian problems
and prevent it from becoming a breeding ground for future acts of
terrorism.</TE>

<HD>Old Age Certainly Isn't What It Used to Be</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARTHA FARNSWORTH RICHE</AU>
<BD>Martha Farnsworth Riche was director of the U.S. Census
Bureau from 1994 to 1998.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The doom and gloom that greets each new report about "the graying of
the population" is unseemly and unwarranted. It's good news, not bad,
that people aren't dying young anymore, and even better news that
most Americans are remaining healthy and active into their 70s and
beyond.</LD>
<LD>   Old age isn't what it used to be, but society is still unprepared
to deal with what it's becoming.</LD>
<LD>   If we adjusted our discussion of age the way we adjust discussion
of dollars--to keep the same meaning over time--we could base our
policies and programs on reality: Americans are staying "young"
longer than they used to, and becoming "old" much later in life.</LD>
<TE>   Our debates on Social Security and education revolve around a set
of boxes we have always grouped the population into, like "under age
18" or "65 and over."</TE>
<TE>   Those terms once defined the ages of dependency; now they reflect
a departed era.</TE>
<TE>   For example, when the Social Security system began, average life
expectancy at birth was not even 62 years, and legislators originally
proposed setting 70 as the age for collecting benefits. But
unemployment was so high during the Great Depression that 65 was
eventually chosen to free up some jobs for younger workers.</TE>
<TE>   Similarly, most 18-year-olds at the time were already independent
of their parents. Today, most young Americans don't take on the major
adult roles of financial independence, marriage or parenthood until
they are 25 or older. In March 1999, 60% of the civilian population
18 to 24 was living with parents or other relatives.</TE>
<TE>   Just as adulthood comes later in life, so too does "old age."</TE>
<TE>   Consternation at the news of more people living longer reflects a
common assumption that it just means more time for them to be sick
and a burden to the young. This may be the case in some developing
countries where aging populations are growing in a context of
inadequate education and health care, weak economies, poverty and
political instability. But in the United States, research from Duke
University suggests that healthy life expectancy is growing just as
fast as life expectancy--and this pattern is repeated throughout the
developed world.</TE>
<TE>   The additional time that Americans who reach 65 can expect to live
has increased from about 12 years in 1900 to nearly 18 years in
1999--16 years for men, 19 years for women--and is projected to
increase even more in the 21st century.</TE>
<TE>   As recently as 1970, the census lumped all people 65 and older
into a single population, but demographers now divide them into
multiple age groups with an array of different needs and resources.</TE>
<TE>   Measured in terms of what people can actually do, physically and
mentally, each new generation reaching 80 over the past two decades
has been less infirm than its predecessor. This new standard of
energy and vitality is based as much on better education about
staying healthy as it is on medical advances, and it seems to have
pushed the standard condition of "old age" well into the 70s and
beyond.</TE>
<TE>   The problem we now face is that this rosier sunset has mostly
occurred since 1960, so that Americans still cling to stereotypes
based on the past.</TE>
<TE>   Instead of bemoaning the growth of the older population,
Americans--both individuals and institutions--need to revise their
assumptions about what "old" means.</TE>
<TE>   We already are seeing that work life neither starts nor ends at
the same ages for everyone.</TE>
<TE>   Assumptions that people will spend their entire work life in one
occupation or that career ladders can only be climbed in one
direction seem ill-suited to a potentially longer and much more
varied career.</TE>
<TE>   Some people already are thinking outside the age boxes.</TE>
<TE>   Builders are redesigning houses originally meant for families
raising children to suit people who now want to live in a house of
their own until they are truly not capable of doing so.</TE>
<TE>   The concept of youth hostels has been extended to elder hostels,
so younger older people can combine traveling with learning.</TE>
<TE>   Enlightened employers are finding that older people's experience
and established work habits often make them better job candidates
than those who are younger.</TE>
<TE>   But until we tackle our own ageism prejudices and youth-centered
assumptions about what we can do for ourselves and what we need
others to do for us, we will not make the best decisions on policies
affecting both ends of our lives. The debate on what to do about
Social Security is just the first step.</TE>

<LD>The movie stars and corporate moguls in those gleaming oceanfront
homes from Malibu to Laguna Beach have their reasons for their
decades-long guerrilla war to keep beachgoers from the surf outside
their pads. Producer David Geffen has found rubberneckers brazenly
checking out his living room, and with no restrooms at the secluded
stretches at Table Rock Beach or La Costa Beach other homeowners have
discovered sunbathers relieving themselves against the sides of their
wind-swept abodes.</LD>
<LD>   So even though state law guarantees every Californian access to
the seashore, the rich have simply barricaded the trails beside their
homes that lead from the highway to the beach. Between Big Rock Beach
and the Malibu Pier, the public can reach the water at only two
places, more than three miles apart. As reported last week by The
Times' Kenneth R. Weiss, other, nearby public access ways long ago
offered by homeowners in exchange for the right to build or remodel
their properties are blocked by chain-link fences, concrete walls,
locked gates and, in one case, a tennis court.</LD>
<TE>   The state Coastal Conservancy is charged with finding local
agencies to build and maintain safe stairways or paths to the beach
and provide services for the public, including trash pickup and on
some beaches restrooms and lifeguards. But the agency has too often
wilted before the high-powered lawyers of homeowners and a blizzard
of legal challenges. In fact, in November the conservancy appeared to
throw in the beach towel, drafting a policy that would have given up
the public's claim to some of the 1,300 access ways offered on paper
up and down the California coast, letting the state's claim to them
expire.</TE>
<TE>   Last month, the agency wisely reversed course, agreeing to
redouble efforts to open dozens of walkways to the beach, including
some between mansions, the most contentious ones. Local communities
and nonprofit groups such as the Sierra Club are stepping forward to
assume responsibility for the trails and stairways. We need more of
this public spirit.</TE>
<TE>   All homeowners want privacy, and fan-weary celebrities complain
that they shouldn't have to put up with the occasional autograph
seeker in a dripping bathing suit pestering them as they dine on
their own decks. But when your home fronts on the public's beach,
your choice is to put up with the public or move.</TE>

<LD>Globalism and bioterrorism are two of many good reasons to seek
excellent leadership for government safety agencies. Which makes it
all the more worrisome that the Food and Drug Administration and the
National Institutes of Health have both been without chief executives
for a year or more. President Bush and Congress  are only now
focusing on filling  these gaps. More delay would be a big mistake.</LD>
<LD>   The FDA, which has had no commissioner for a year, is scheduled
this spring to draw up plans to speed up drug approval during an
emergency without compromising public safety, close safety loopholes
that Agriculture Secretary Ann M. Veneman says could let terrorists
infect the nation's food supply, and address demands to tighten
oversight of the new abortion pill, RU-486.</LD>
<LD>   The NIH, with no director for two years, oversees all
taxpayer-funded health research, from stem cell experiments to
cloning. It is in the midst of a multibillion-dollar anti-terrorism
project that includes developing a new vaccine for anthrax and
treatments for emerging pathogens like prions, which cause mad cow
disease.</LD>
<TE>   Luckily for both agencies, strong candidates are waiting in the
wings.</TE>
<TE>   The best candidate for NIH head is Anthony Fauci, currently the
director of a major NIH division, the National Institute of Allergy
and Infectious Diseases. Fauci is a deft politician and the nation's
leading AIDS researcher. Bush reportedly offered him the job, but
Fauci has held out for assurance that he would have ''protected
time'' each week to escape politics and do his own research. The
president should give him that comfort and urge him to serve the
nation.</TE>
<TE>   This week, Bush is expected to nominate another promising leader,
Alastair J.J. Wood, a Vanderbilt University assistant vice chancellor
and medicine professor, to head the FDA.</TE>
<TE>   Wood generally won respect as a medical peer reviewer while he was
editor of the drug-review department of the  New England Journal of
Medicine. His term suffered some tarnish in early 2000 when he
admitted he had overseen studies published in the journal that failed
to disclose their authors' potential conflicts of interest--a
violation of the journal's policy. However, Wood gained broad respect
while serving on an FDA advisory committee when he forthrightly
denounced the way the FDA had mishandled the potentially fatal
diabetes drug Rezulin, releasing it despite clear indications it was
dangerous.</TE>
<TE>   The Senate should fast-track confirmation hearings for Wood, who
is superior to the two other potential nominees whose names the
administration has floated, biotechnology executive Michael Astrue
and Lester Crawford, a former FDA bureaucrat who ran a
food-industry-backed think tank.</TE>
<TE>   The FDA and NIH may seem like obscure, easily ignored federal
agencies, but their social importance is growing and they need strong
leadership to be strong watchdogs of the national health.</TE>

<LD>California needs to hear Gray Davis the governor and leader, not Gray
Davis the perpetual candidate, when he delivers his State of the
State address to the Legislature Tuesday evening. Davis should not
fudge the seriousness of the state's fiscal situation. And he should
refrain from ruling out any new taxes in the effort to offset a
$12.4-billion plunge in state revenues.</LD>
<LD>   Nothing should be left off the bargaining table except basic
safety net programs that provide food, shelter or health care to
low-income workers, those hit hardest by a downturn. Such programs
are often administered by local governments, which in the last
recession suffered a huge loss when Sacramento diverted revenues to
make up a state deficit. The state should not resort to such actions
again.</LD>
<LD>   Republicans, eager to bolster their sagging political fortunes
before the March 5 statewide primary, are blaming the governor even
for the sale of lottery Scratchers after the big prizes were claimed.
And they have signaled that they will fight tooth and nail any talk
of new taxes. But this is a time when the state desperately needs
some real--dare we say it?--statesmanship.</LD>
<TE>   Legislators should not forget that it was a GOP governor, Pete
Wilson, who helped the state weather the recession of the early 1990s
by agreeing to $14 billion in combined budget cuts and tax increases.
An idea that should be considered is one that Wilson embraced a
decade ago, a temporary restoration of the top brackets of the state
income tax, up to 11%. This would barely dent the permanent federal
break that the wealthiest Californians are receiving from President
Bush's tax cuts and would produce as much as $2.5 billion in new
revenue.</TE>
<TE>   The Legislature returns from recess today, Davis delivers his
speech to a joint session Tuesday and then on Thursday he presents
his budget for the fiscal year beginning July 1. Fiscal issues will
dominate this session, but other jobs need doing. The state's energy
regulatory structure remains a mess following last year's crisis,
Pacific Gas &amp; Electric Co. still is mired in bankruptcy, and
Sacramento is holding billions of dollars worth of power contracts
that aren't worth the money the state paid for them. Another priority
is the sale of revenue bonds needed to repay the state's general fund
the $6 billion taken last year to buy electricity.</TE>
<TE>   Many legislators are rushing to introduce bills to deal with
terrorism in the wake of the Sept. 11 attacks. The proposals range
from making it easier to tap telephones of suspected terrorists to
increasing penalties for perpetrating terrorist hoaxes. Some of these
may be worthy and necessary, but the Legislature must resist the
temptation to enact a host of security laws. Senate leader John
Burton (D-San Francisco) correctly notes that this is primarily a
federal job.</TE>
<TE>   Davis and the 2002 Legislature face tough, urgent statewide
problems as they head into reelection campaigns. If they are
paralyzed by the demands of politics they will simply alienate the
voters whose view of government was reshaped for the better by Sept.
11.</TE>

<LD>Prospects for an economic revival and a pickup in corporate sales and
earnings could make 2002 the first year in the new century in which
bonds fail to outperform stocks, Wall Street analysts say.</LD>
<LD>   However, the risks of continued economic weakness and of a
geopolitical shock like the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11 remain high
enough that demand for bonds probably will stay strong, and another
year of decent bond performance is hardly farfetched, such experts
say.</LD>
<LD>   U.S. Treasury bonds, government-agency issues and high-quality
corporate and municipal bonds have been the places to be for the last
two years, as the stock market floundered and the U.S. economy
finally ran out of steam after one of the longest post-World War II
expansions.</LD>
<TE>   Falling market interest rates in 2000 and 2001 boosted the value
of older, higher-yielding bonds, providing many bondholders with a
paper capital gain on top of their interest earnings in both years.</TE>
<TE>   The average total return for government bond mutual funds of all
maturities was 6.7% last year, which followed a 10.4% return in 2000,
according to Morningstar Inc. Total return counts interest yield plus
any gain or loss in a fund's share value.</TE>
<TE>   By contrast, the average domestic stock mutual fund tumbled 10.9%
in 2001 after losing 1.9% in 2000, Morningstar data show.</TE>
<TE>   Lately, however, investors have soured on the Treasury market,
anticipating an end to the Federal Reserve's intense credit-easing
campaign, during which the central bank chopped its key short-term
interest rate target 11 straight times, to 1.75% from 6.5%, in less
than a year.</TE>
<TE>   If the early signals of a comeback in the domestic economy are
confirmed, investors might continue to push longer-term Treasury
yields higher, analysts warn. Just since the end of November, the
yield on the 10-year T-note has jumped from 4.75% to 5.13% now.</TE>
<TE>   For fixed-income investors, the main beneficiary of an economic
recovery could be the corporate "junk" bond sector, which, like the
stock market, has underperformed investment-grade bonds for two
years.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, junk bond mutual funds delivered an average total
return of just 1.5%, according to Morningstar. That reflected the
plunge in the bonds' prices, which offset most of the high interest
income the securities paid.</TE>
<TE>   But "what's bad news for Treasuries may be better news for
low-quality bonds" in 2002, said investment strategist William E.
Rhodes of Rhodes Analytics in Boston.</TE>
<TE>   Here's a look at last year's performance of key bond market
sectors and the 2002 outlook:</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Treasuries</TE>
<TE>   Not that anyone could have wished for such a reminder, but Sept.
11 demonstrated once again that Wall Street is vulnerable to far more
than just economic cycles.</TE>
<TE>   The terrorist attacks sparked a stampede for the safety of
Treasury securities. Even triple-A-rated corporate bonds were ditched
in the rush to safety.</TE>
<TE>   In the aftermath of the attacks, the yield on the benchmark
10-year T-note fell to 4.18%, a low not seen since October 1998, when
Russia's bond default triggered a financial panic.</TE>
<TE>   Treasury yields have been climbing fairly steadily ever since the
attacks, reflecting signs of economic strength and some investors'
shift of money from bonds to stocks.</TE>
<TE>   The consensus of 24 economists surveyed by the Bond Market Assn.
is for an economic recovery that begins in the second quarter and
produces full-year gross domestic product growth of 2.5%, adjusted
for mild, 2% inflation.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the surveyed economists think the Fed will resume raising
short-term interest rates in the third quarter and that the Fed's key
rate will rise to 2.5% by year-end.</TE>
<TE>   Such a scenario would make this a lackluster year for the Treasury
market, analysts say. At best, owners of Treasury bond mutual funds
might earn a yield in the 4%-to-5.5% range and see their share values
hold steady. But if the economy's recovery is more robust than
expected and yields on new Treasury issues rocket, government bond
fund share values could decline significantly.</TE>
<TE>   Some analysts, however, believe the greater risk is that the
economy sputters again. Economists at the Jerome Levy Forecasting
Center in Mount Kisco, N.Y., believe that the financial bubble of the
1990s has left the nation with a huge private debt burden that
probably will be wrung out by years of slow growth, with weak
consumer spending and business investment.</TE>
<TE>   Srinivas Thiruvadanthai, research director at the Levy Center,
expects inflation to hover around zero and a fitful economic recovery
to begin in the second half. Under that scenario, the chance of the
Fed raising rates this year is almost nil, he contends.</TE>
<TE>   In his view, Treasuries once again will rule in terms of
bond-market performance. He expects the yield on the 30-year T-bond
to fall to 4% this year from 5.54% today. New terrorism or other
political problems would only heighten the appeal of super-safe
Treasuries, he said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Corporates</TE>
<TE>   If long-term interest rates continue to creep up in 2002 and the
economy strengthens, chances are that many companies will pull back
on their issuance of new debt after a blockbuster year for issuance
in 2001, experts said.</TE>
<TE>   That's likely to be true particularly if a rising stock market
enables companies to raise capital more cheaply that way.</TE>
<TE>   The improving economy should cause a narrowing of "spreads"
between the yields on Treasuries and corporate bonds of similar
maturity, according to Michael Maurer, bond strategist at brokerage
A.G. Edwards in St. Louis.</TE>
<TE>   The terrorist attacks and the quick descent of the U.S. economy in
2001 kept corporate yields high relative to Treasury yields. So even
if Treasury rates stay flat this year, corporate yields have room to
decline, Maurer said.</TE>
<TE>   When default risks outweigh fears of inflation, as in an economic
downturn, higher-quality bonds tend to be in greatest demand. But as
economic conditions improve and companies start generating stronger
cash flow, investors get bolder and start shopping for higher yields,
bidding up the values of corporate bonds.</TE>
<TE>   That process got going in the fourth quarter of 2001, as junk bond
mutual fund total returns averaged 5.5%, while total returns went
negative or barely positive for government and most investment-grade
corporate bond funds.</TE>
<TE>   Some analysts believe that the rush back into the junk bond market
may have been premature. Martin Mauro and William Scapell,
fixed-income analysts at Merrill Lynch &amp; Co., for example, said they
"suggest a fairly low allocation to the [junk] sector for now, but we
expect to increase that allocation once the near-term prospects for
the economy start to look brighter."</TE>
<TE>   Among corporate bond sectors, they favor "conservative industries
such as aerospace and defense, insurance and selected utilities,"
while recommending caution toward bonds of airlines, banks and
brokerages, autos, capital goods and paper and forest products firms.</TE>
<TE>   Economist David Blitzer at Standard &amp; Poor's Corp. thinks 2002
could be a good year for junk bonds after a dismal three-year period.
But he notes that investors--and junk bond fund managers--need to be
highly discriminating in the type of junk they own. "If you're going
to do all that research, you might as well buy the stocks and have
more fun," he said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Tax-Free Municipals</TE>
<TE>   New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg took office last week, calling
for 20% job reductions in some city departments as a means of coping
with Gotham's fiscal woes.</TE>
<TE>   California officials, meanwhile, are debating ways to reduce a
projected $12-billion budget deficit.</TE>
<TE>   Although red ink has begun flowing again in many state and
municipal budgets after years of surplus, analysts maintain that most
local government entities remain in pretty sound shape financially
and are able to take on some deficit spending while waiting for the
economy to turn around.</TE>
<TE>   That could leave investors quite willing to buy tax-free muni
bonds at or near current yields, analysts say.</TE>
<TE>   In California, 2001 was a record year for municipal bond issuance,
with $31 billion of bonds floated, or more than 11% of the nationwide
total, said Zane Mann, editor of the California Municipal Bond
Advisor newsletter in Palm Springs.</TE>
<TE>   More than one-third of the total were "refunding" bonds, meaning
their proceeds were used to pay off older, higher-interest bonds, as
issuers took advantage of lower rates to reduce their borrowing
costs.</TE>
<TE>   Volatility was severe in most parts of the bond market last year,
but munis were an oasis of relative calm. The average yield of
longer-term California munis ranged from 4.91% to 5.36% during the
year--the smallest swing in the 18 years that Mann has been recording
such numbers, he said. "That's a tribute to the orderliness of the
tax-exempt market," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Even so, most muni bond mutual fund categories recorded negative
total returns in the fourth quarter, as price declines outweighed
interest earnings.</TE>
<TE>   Mann, like other analysts, thinks California muni issuance
probably will decline from last year's record level but remain strong
overall. Demand, too, should continue strong because munis' tax
exemption is one of the best ways for people to deflect some of the
state's high income taxes, he said.</TE>
<TE>   A muni bond yielding 4.6% is the equivalent of a taxable bond
yielding 7% for someone in the 35% federal marginal tax bracket. With
yields on money-market funds and other short-term securities at
record lows of 2% or less, more investors are likely to be hunting
for better returns in 2002, which could help muni performance.</TE>
<TE>   Munis boast a safe record: Historically, muni bond defaults are
rarities, unlike corporate bond defaults. Still, in a weaker economy
investors shopping for individual muni issues need to be more
careful, Mann said.</TE>
<TE>   The main areas of caution should be in airport muni bonds, because
of the risks that grew out of the terrorist attacks, and in the
hospital bond sector, as health-care costs keep rising while
government reimbursement keeps falling, he said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   TOP-RATED BOND FUNDS Bond funds, ranked according to a system
developed by The Times and fund tracker Morningstar Inc., are listed
in more than a dozen categories beginning on U10.</TE>

<HD>Fees Take a Big Bite Out of Some Funds' Returns</HD>
<DH>Investors' lack of concern about annual charges has helped
lead to higher costs, even negative returns. Now's the time to pay
attention.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LIZ PULLIAM WESTON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>If investors will ever be aware of the management fees they pay on
their mutual funds, it ought to be now. Consider:</LD>
<LD>   * High annual expenses drove some money market fund yields to
nearly zero in 2001. Even money market funds with more moderate fees
ended up with negative returns after inflation and taxes were
considered.</LD>
<LD>   * Although bond investments generally did well last year, mutual
fund fees ate up one-quarter to one-third of the gross returns on
many bond funds--a proportion one analyst called "obscene."</LD>
<TE>   * High management and administration costs added insult to the
injury of losing stock fund investments. Many of the funds with the
highest fees have been among the worst performers, according to
Standard &amp; Poor's.</TE>
<TE>   Yet investment experts say investors still pay too little
attention to management costs when evaluating their funds'
performance. Annual fees taken directly and automatically by fund
companies from portfolio assets include the costs of managing,
administering and advertising the funds.</TE>
<TE>   On top of those costs, some investors may pay upfront, deferred or
back-end sales charges, or "loads," depending on how they purchase
the fund shares.</TE>
<TE>   Some investors aren't aware of the effect of annual fund expenses
on their returns, while others don't know that lower-cost
alternatives are available, said Russ Kinnel, director of fund
analysis for fund tracker Morningstar Inc.</TE>
<TE>   "There's absolutely no reason you have to pay those" higher fees,
Kinnel said. "Some of the very best funds out there are low-cost."</TE>
<TE>   Investors' lack of concern about fees has helped lead to higher
costs in recent years, analysts said. The median expense ratio for
all mutual funds is about 1.4% a year, or $140 for each $10,000
invested. That's 10% higher than in 1995, according to fund tracker
Lipper Inc.</TE>
<TE>   "I wouldn't say the industry has covered itself in glory" on the
fee issue, Kinnel said. Three large mutual fund families--Vanguard
Group, T. Rowe Price Group Inc. and Fidelity Investments--"are doing
great jobs of passing along economies of scale" in the form of lower
fees. "A lot of the others are not."</TE>
<TE>   Seemingly small differences in management fees can have huge
effects on returns over time, Kinnel said.</TE>
<TE>   Consider an investor who puts $10,000 into each of two mutual
funds invested in a similar mix of stocks. One fund has a 1% annual
expense ratio, but the other comes with a 2% annual cost.</TE>
<TE>   If the stocks in both portfolios grow at an annualized 10% rate,
the first investment would be worth $147,306 after 30 years. The
second, with the higher fees, would be worth $109,357. One extra
percentage point in costs over the years makes a difference of
$37,949--more than three times the initial investment.</TE>
<TE>   Some mutual fund managers contend that their higher expenses pay
off in better results. But investors shouldn't assume that a higher
cost ratio guarantees higher returns, because the reality is often
exactly the opposite, analysts said.</TE>
<TE>   A study by Standard &amp; Poor's, for example, found that some of the
highest-cost mutual funds badly trailed their peers in performance
over the last three years. One of the worst performers of the group,
Frontier Funds Equity Fund, had annual expenses of more than 15%. The
fund lost nearly one-quarter of its value since 1998, while its peers
were up 2.9%, S&amp;P said.</TE>
<TE>   Frontier is tiny, with less than $200,000 in assets under
management. Investors in such small funds often are saddled with high
fees, because the costs of running the fund are generally fixed and
can't be spread over a larger amount of assets, S&amp;P said.</TE>
<TE>   Investors in larger funds can face similar problems, however.
Expense ratios can rise when a bear market or poor performance
shrinks assets, while costs stay the same or rise. The problem can be
exacerbated as some investors cash out, leaving the remaining
shareholders to pay a larger proportion of the management costs.</TE>
<TE>   How a fund is managed also can affect fees. A fund that employs
researchers and star stock pickers typically will have a higher
annual expense ratio than a passively managed index fund that mimics
a market benchmark such as the S&amp;P 500. Likewise, international funds
have higher average expenses than most domestic funds, because
evaluating foreign investments is typically more difficult.</TE>
<TE>   But investors needn't pay more than 1% a year for a competent,
broadly diversified domestic stock mutual fund or 1.3% for an
international fund, Kinnel said.</TE>
<TE>   And when it comes to bond funds, lower management fees are almost
always better, he said. He recommends investing in government bond
funds that take no more than 0.6% of assets annually in fees and
corporate bond funds that keep annual expenses below 0.7%.</TE>
<TE>   "You can end up giving away one-quarter to one-third of the yield
of the portfolio [in fees], and that's just obscene," Kinnel said.</TE>
<TE>   For example, investors in Ivy Bond B, a long-term corporate bond
fund, lost about one-quarter of their return last year to expenses.
The fund's annual expense ratio was 2.45%, giving the fund an
after-expenses total return of 7.6%, according to Morningstar.</TE>
<TE>   By contrast, investors in HSBC Investor Fixed-Income, also a
long-term corporate bond fund, gave up far less of their 2001 gross
return to expenses. The fund's expense ratio was 0.61% and its net
total return was 8.39%, according to Morningstar.</TE>
<TE>   Investors can find out how much their mutuals are costing them by
looking up their funds' expense ratios in the tables in this section
or by visiting www.morningstar.com. In addition to listing the
expense ratios of each fund, Morningstar offers a "portfolio X-ray"
that shows the dollar amount the investor pays for annual expenses.</TE>
<TE>   Knowing how much of a fund's gross return is going to pay expenses
is particularly important in the case of money market funds. The
average money market fund expense ratio is now 0.47%, while the
funds' average yield is 1.59%. That means that fees, on average, are
consuming nearly one-quarter of the funds' gross yields, said Peter
Crane, vice president and managing editor of Imoneynet.com, which
tracks money markets.</TE>
<TE>   Some investors did even worse. The net yield on Invesco Cash
Reserves C, for example, tumbled to 0.01% last year after annual
management and sales fees were deducted. The fund's parent company
stepped in to waive the fees temporarily, Crane said. The fund now
yields about 0.68%.</TE>
<TE>   Poor returns and high fees mean that more than 200 of the 1,600
money market funds Imoneynet.com tracks had yields of less than 1% at
year end.</TE>
<TE>   "Costs of one-half percentage point didn't matter as much when
yields were 5%, but when yields are 1.5%, it's starting to look bad,"
Crane said.</TE>
<TE>   By contrast, the best-yielding taxable money markets return
slightly above 2%.</TE>

<HD>Apply Principles of Parenting to Your Portfolio</HD>
<DH>Patience and discipline are among tools also useful for
managing and nurturing investments.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KATHY M. KRISTOF</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Need help handling today's tumultuous financial markets? Don't think
finance. Think family.</LD>
<LD>   Managing money is a lot like managing children, professionals say.
It can be painful and frustrating at times, but parents with patience
and discipline are likely to find the results gratifying in the end.</LD>
<LD>   "Long-term, we are optimistic about the potential for our
teenagers and our portfolio," said Alan Bernstein, a parent of two
and an investment advisor with Stratigraphic Asset Management in
Coral Gables, Fla. "But those unpredictable short-term movements are
maddening."</LD>
<TE>   Herewith, some tips on "parenting" your portfolio to increase your
odds of long-term success, regardless of markets' short-term
gyrations:</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Learn the Basics</TE>
<TE>   "The first thing I tell parents is that none of us are born
knowing how to parent any more than we are born knowing how to drive
a car," said Elizabeth Pantley, a Seattle parent-educator. "We have
to study and learn and talk to people. The more we know, the better
job we do."</TE>
<TE>   Knowledge keeps new parents from calling psychologists when a
2-year-old throws a temper tantrum. It also should keep seasoned
investors from selling in a panic--or from loading their portfolios
with technology stocks without understanding the risks.</TE>
<TE>   Savvy investors know that stock prices are subject to sharp,
unpredictable and often-embarrassing swings in value. That makes
putting the rent money in stocks as inappropriate as taking a toddler
to an opera.</TE>
<TE>   When investments are in the right places--short-term money in safe
and predictable vehicles such as bank deposits, long-term money in
riskier but higher-yielding stocks--investors can relax knowing that
no matter how bad the market's near-term behavior, it eventually will
grow out of it.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Have a Mission</TE>
<TE>   Everyone needs a clear idea of the handful of important values
they hope to pass on to their children--such as integrity, courage
and kindness, said Victoria Collins, an Irvine-based certified
financial planner. Keeping these big-picture values in mind helps
remind parents why it's not a good idea to preach the virtues of
honesty while lying about a child's age so you can get a discount at
the movies.</TE>
<TE>   The finance corollary is called an investment policy statement,
said Collins, who has produced as many investment books--five--as she
has children.</TE>
<TE>   This statement should detail what you want to accomplish with your
portfolio--your short-term and long-term goals--and what you aren't
willing to do for potential financial gain, she said. Listing your
limitations is a way to spell out your tolerance for risk.</TE>
<TE>   "The investment policy statement gives the parameters of what you
can tolerate and provides guidance on where you want to go and how
you want to get there," Collins said.</TE>
<TE>   Although this policy statement won't help you pick individual
securities, it will help you figure out broadly how much money ought
to go into which category of investment--stocks, bonds, cash and real
estate, for example.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Be Persistent</TE>
<TE>   "Investing regularly is like telling your kids to make their
beds," said Barbara Steinmetz, a planner with Steinmetz Financial
Planning in Burlingame, Calif. "Every day, you tell them. Every day,
they groan, and say, 'But Mom ' But after a while, it becomes
routine--it's not a sacrifice, it's just what you do."</TE>
<TE>   Persistent investing is called dollar-cost averaging. Anyone who
invests through a 401(k) retirement savings plan already is doing
dollar-cost averaging. Every month, the same amount goes into
savings, often through some sort of automatic deduction.</TE>
<TE>   With 401(k) plans, the deduction comes out of your paycheck.
However, investors whose employers don't offer such plans can set up
dollar-cost-averaging programs directly with many mutual funds, banks
or brokerages.</TE>
<TE>   There are two main advantages to such persistent investing,
experts say. The first is that it makes investing a habit--much like
making the bed.</TE>
<TE>   The second is that if you invest regular amounts, in good times
and bad, you buy more shares when stock prices are down and fewer
when prices are up. If investment values rise over time, as they have
historically, this strategy pays rich long-term rewards.</TE>
<TE>   Consider a person who invests $120 a month, every month, in the
same stock or mutual fund, said Kirk Bogard, regional area manager
and vice president of Fidelity Investments in Newport Beach. The
first month, the stock costs $8; the second, it costs $12; and the
third, it costs $10.</TE>
<TE>   "Your average price is $10 a share, right? Wrong," Bogard said.
"Your average share price is $9.73. Because you're buying more when
the price is down, you've brought down your average purchase price."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Be Patient</TE>
<TE>   It would be great if you could jump into the stock market right
before it rises and jump out before it falls again--and get the
cycles right every time. But just as it's nearly impossible to have a
video camera ready at hand when children do something priceless,
market rallies and routs are highly unpredictable. And the cost of
not being there at the right times is dear.</TE>
<TE>   Consider what would have happened if an investor had missed the 50
best days of the last major bull market cycle, from 1983 through the
first quarter of 2000. Those 50 days amounted to just about 1% of the
entire period.</TE>
<TE>   An investor in the market for that entire period would have earned
an average annual return of 14.7% in stocks, according to an analysis
by the Leuthold Group, an investment research firm. Yet an investor
who was out of the market for the 50 best days, though in for the
rest, would have earned just 4.6% a year, Leuthold data show.</TE>
<TE>   "By trying to time the market, you potentially miss out on market
rallies that can substantially improve your overall return and
long-term wealth," said Bob Doll, chief investment officer at Merrill
Lynch Investment Managers. "What's most important is not timing the
market, but rather time in the market."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Keep Your Balance</TE>
<TE>   Meloni Hallock, partner in the personal financial counseling group
at Ernst &amp; Young in Los Angeles, tells clients they can't keep all
their money in one investment category, just as children can't grow
up eating just one type of food.</TE>
<TE>   "You are not going to be a healthy, well-rounded person without
balance," she said. "You've got to hit all the food groups."</TE>
<TE>   For most investors, that means keeping some money in stocks to
provide growth and protection against inflation; some in bonds to
provide income and stability; and some in cash accounts--such as
money-market funds or bank savings--for safety and liquidity.</TE>
<TE>   A diversified investment mix not only provides money to handle
different goals, it creates a portfolio that's less subject to
stomach-turning swings in value, experts note.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Stick to Your Standards</TE>
<TE>   Financial disasters can happen when investors fail to stick to
reasonable standards. Having standards means maintaining portfolio
diversification by "rebalancing" assets periodically. It also may
mean selling a stock if its price relative to earnings gets
drastically out of line with its historical trend.</TE>
<TE>   Just ask Enron Corp. employees or big holders of almost any
dot-com stock. Many of them failed to set and follow standards that
could have saved them from huge losses.</TE>
<TE>   One simple investing standard is that no single stock should make
up more than 10% of an investor's portfolio, no matter how bright the
company's future may appear.</TE>
<TE>   Following strict standards is tough--both as a parent and as an
investor--because it almost always requires going against the crowd.</TE>
<TE>   Gordon Phares, a former banker, says he once left his son in jail
overnight for participating in a prank that got him arrested. When
his son tried to make excuses--and complain that the other kids'
parents didn't react as negatively--Phares left him for another
night.</TE>
<TE>   "We wanted him to understand that there are consequences to every
action you take," said Phares, who now works with San Luis Obispo
financial planner Judith Martindale. "After that, he kept his nose
very clean."</TE>
<TE>   Sticking to standards as a parent requires making the kids study,
practice piano or wash their faces, even when it's late, inconvenient
or under protest.</TE>
<TE>   "You've got to remind yourself that in the end, it's not going to
be good for me or my child to throw out the rules," Hallock said.</TE>
<TE>   The same applies to managing money. When keeping your standards
means having to swim hardest against the tide--deciding to sell
technology stocks during the mania of early 2000, for example--the
likelihood also is highest that you're making the right decision for
the long run.</TE>

<HD>2002: BREAKOUT --OR BUST?</HD>
<DH>As 2002 dawns, the bulls are running again. But harsh
experience has taught investors to watch their backs.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TOM PETRUNO and JOSH FRIEDMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Just as the thought of staying in the stock market was becoming
almost too much to bear for some investors, the fourth quarter
arrived.</LD>
<LD>   The rally that has lifted share prices since September has fanned
hopes that the worst market decline in more than 25 years finally is
over.</LD>
<LD>   But the damage that has been done may take a long time to repair.
Start with this harsh reality: With the market's slump since March
2000, even investors who've been in stocks for three years may have
only losses to show for their efforts, as measured by average returns
in key mutual fund categories.</LD>
<TE>   The average large-stock "growth" fund, for example, rebounded
14.8% in the fourth quarter, according to fund tracker Morningstar
Inc. Yet the annualized return for that category is a negative 3.2%
over the three years ended Dec. 31.</TE>
<TE>   It's as if investors have traveled a long and tortuous road and
wound up back where they started, or even behind their starting
point.</TE>
<TE>   As 2002 dawns, however, the bulls are running again on Wall
Street. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index rose 2.1% in the first three
trading days of the new year, padding its 10.3% price gain in the
fourth quarter. Market optimists see share prices decisively breaking
out to higher ground this year, assuming the U.S. economy is growing
again after last year's recession and the Federal Reserve leaves
short-term interest rates at 40-year lows well into 2002.</TE>
<TE>   But if the last few years have taught investors one lesson, it's
to be suspicious of glowing consensus forecasts. After all, Wall
Street analysts almost uniformly believed Internet stocks were worth
their sky-high prices early in 2000. And as recently as last summer,
many of the most respected fund managers still considered
now-bankrupt energy trading giant Enron Corp. to be a premier
investment.</TE>
<TE>   What's more, not one of the market strategists at the biggest U.S.
brokerages foresaw the extent of last year's stock plunge, which left
the S&amp;P 500 index down 11.8% for the year (including dividends), the
worst calendar-year loss since 1974.</TE>
<TE>   Yet as share prices rebound nearly across the board, many of those
same strategists are projecting double-digit gains for equity
investors in 2002.</TE>
<TE>   The favored sector of the late 1990s--technology--has led the
rally since September, with the average tech-stock mutual fund up
36.8% in the fourth quarter, according to Morningstar. But the rally
was broader than just tech: All but two of the 28 stock fund
categories tracked by Morningstar rose in the quarter.</TE>
<TE>   Still, the average tech fund lost 38.3% for the year. The average
domestic stock fund slumped 10.9%, which, as in the case of the S&amp;P
500 index, was the biggest calendar-year drop since 1974. In 2000 the
average domestic stock fund fell 1.9%.</TE>
<TE>   One strategist who is wary of the market's recent comeback is
Tobias Levkovich at Salomon Smith Barney in New York. It is "somewhat
disconcerting to see markets ... bounce back with the volatility and
magnitude we've seen in the past 10 weeks, because it suggests that
the investment community is still seeking the same kind of returns it
once took for granted," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Virtually every mutual fund manager now professes to be paying
close attention to stock valuations--in other words, none of them
wants to run the risk of overpaying for stocks relative to earnings
potential. But so far, that hasn't stopped many investors from riding
the market's new momentum, even as price-to-earnings ratios rocket
again.</TE>
<TE>   The average blue-chip stock is priced at more than 20 times
analysts' consensus estimate of 2002 earnings per share. Even if that
P/E is "fair," it still raises the question of whether a continuing
rally this year could quickly make many stocks overvalued again.</TE>
<TE>   Technology remains a worry for many fund managers.</TE>
<TE>   "I think the economy has bottomed and it's possible we're already
in recovery mode, but certain parts of the market have already
anticipated that, perhaps overdoing it," said Brian Berghuis, manager
of the T. Rowe Price Mid-Cap Growth fund.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not overenthusiastic about technology, where excesses in
supply still need to be worked off and the valuations of some of
these companies remain high," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Berghuis said his fund, which lost 1% last year but has averaged
gains of 9.6% in the last three years, remains underweighted in tech
and communications. He noted that, historically, the leaders of one
bull market don't normally lead the next one. Berghuis said he
believes the health-care sector--and the biotechnology industry in
particular--could be a key growth area in the next bull move.</TE>
<TE>   For 2002, uncertainty over the strength of an economic recovery
and corporate earnings, along with the risk of new terrorist attacks
or other unforeseen global political traumas, mean that forecasting
the market's near-term course may be as difficult as ever.</TE>
<TE>   It could be a new bull market, as some predict. Or stocks could be
stuck in a trading range--a cycle of rallies and sell-offs that
leaves prices overall no higher a year from now.</TE>
<TE>   In a trading-range market, nimbleness and patience could be the
keys to success. "The patient investor, in our view, can outpace
[market indexes] by keeping some purchasing power in reserve, waiting
for an opportunity to buy into good companies at more attractive
valuations," said Thomas McManus, strategist at Banc of America
Securities in New York.</TE>
<TE>   The worst-case scenario would be that the market bust that began
in 2000 still hasn't run its course. If major market indexes lose
ground this year, it would mark the first period of three straight
calendar year losses since 1939-41.</TE>
<TE>   Given the risks, financial advisors say the best strategy remains
the same one that would have limited the damage to most investors'
portfolios over the last three years: Stay well-diversified.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, even as technology stocks collapsed in 2000 and 2001, many
other market sectors posted gains or suffered only minor losses.</TE>
<TE>   For the last two years, mutual funds that target small and
mid-size stocks have held up better than funds that own big-name
stocks, as investors have broadened their search for promising
business ideas.</TE>
<TE>   Also, "value"-oriented funds held up better than "growth"-oriented
funds in 2000 and 2001. Value funds tend to favor stocks that sell
for below-average price-to-earnings ratios or offer some kind of
relative value lure, such as a high dividend yield.</TE>
<TE>   The average small-stock value fund rose 17.4% last year, according
to Morningstar. The average real estate stock fund (usually
considered a value sector) rose 9.3%.</TE>
<TE>   The year's standout was a category that was all but abandoned by
most investors in the late '90s: precious metals funds, which
generally own shares of gold- and silver-mining firms. That sector
rose 20.2% for the year.</TE>
<TE>   Diversification in some foreign stock sectors also would have
helped U.S. investors. The average emerging-markets stock fund fell
3.6% for the year, one-third the loss of the average U.S. stock fund.</TE>
<TE>   But major foreign markets in Europe and Asia fared worse than the
U.S. market, pulling the average foreign stock fund down 21.8% for
the year. The dollar's strength deepened overseas losses.</TE>
<TE>   The fourth-quarter leader board, not surprisingly, was dominated
by tech funds and de facto tech funds, including a trio of manager
Garrett Van Wagoner's roller-coaster products, Van Wagoner Emerging
Growth, Van Wagoner Post Venture and Van Wagoner Technology, each of
which rocketed more than 80% in the period--but still finished the
year with huge losses.</TE>
<TE>   But for the year as a whole, fund managers who held value stocks
or whose portfolios mixed stocks and bonds fared best.</TE>
<TE>   Leaders among large-stock funds included Thompson Plumb Growth, a
"blend" fund (owning value and growth stocks) that rose 19.1% in
2001; Dodge &amp; Cox Stock, a value-oriented fund that gained 9.3%; and
Citizens Value, a socially screened value fund that climbed 13.4%.</TE>
<TE>   In the mid-size-stock area, the year's standouts included TCW
Galileo Value Opportunities, which rose 33.7%; Merrill Lynch Mid Cap
Value, which gained 25.5%; Oppenheimer Main St. Opportunity, a blend
fund that climbed 16.1%; and Needham Growth and Liberty Acorn Twenty,
growth funds that gained 12.1% and 8%, respectively.</TE>
<TE>   Small-stock-fund winners for the year included Franklin MicroCap
Value, up 41.3%; Aegis Value, up 42.7%; and Wasatch Small Cap Growth,
up 24.2%.</TE>
<TE>   Among the nation's most widely held stock funds, the $80-billion
Fidelity Magellan lost 11.7% in 2001, earning a moral victory over
its biggest rival, the $87-billion Vanguard 500 Index fund, which
dropped 12%, in line with the S&amp;P 500 index it tracks.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, solid stock-picking in the value area helped two fund
managers extend their record winning streaks, although neither
performance was especially pretty: Van Kampen Equity Income's James
Gilligan lost 2.2% for the year, beating the average domestic hybrid
fund for the 11th year in a row ("hybrid," or balanced, funds hold a
mix of stocks and bonds) and Legg Mason Value Trust's William Miller
lost 9.3%, beating the S&amp;P 500 index for the 11th straight year.</TE>
<TE>   In the long run, of course, it's the best stock pickers who
produce the best results for their investors. If the market continues
to be a difficult place overall, investors will find it much easier
to separate the mutual fund industry's best stock pickers from those
who were just along for the ride in the late 1990s.</TE>

<HD>Fund Managers Position for 2002</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>JOSH FRIEDMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>For a stock mutual fund manager, beating one's category average was
tough in 2000, and tough in 2001. But beating the average both
years--amid the longest and deepest bear market on Wall Street in a
generation--may be considered a true feat.</LD>
<LD>   In a so-called stock-picker's market, that kind of track record
suggests genuine talent in stock-picking.</LD>
<LD>   Here are five fund managers who outperformed their category
average, as calculated by Morningstar Inc., by at least three
percentage points in both of the last two years, and how they're
positioning their portfolios for 2002:</LD>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Richie Freeman, Smith Barney Aggressive Growth Fund, in New York:
Freeman's fund gained 19.2% in 2000 and lost 5% in 2001, compared
with average returns of negative 14% and negative 24% for large-cap
growth stock funds overall in those years, according to Morningstar.</TE>
<TE>   Freeman has managed the portfolio from its inception in November
1983. The fund's 10-year annualized return ranks it in the top 1% of
Morningstar's large-cap growth fund category.</TE>
<TE>   Freeman said he looks for companies that "can control their own
destiny to some extent, whose success is determined by their own
products and not the economy."</TE>
<TE>   That focus most recently has led him to more health-care stocks,
especially biotech companies. The biotech sector can be highly
volatile, but Freeman said he has emphasized profitable companies
such as IDEC Pharmaceuticals Corp., Amgen Inc. and Chiron Corp.</TE>
<TE>   "We're interested in dynamic, exciting companies," he said. "We
follow trends, not fads, and there's a powerful trend that has to do
with treating diseases heretofore untreatable. These are companies
that are able to prolong people's lives."</TE>
<TE>   Other health-care holdings in the fund include generic-drug maker
Forest Laboratories Inc. and managed-care company UnitedHealth Group
Inc.</TE>
<TE>   Though Morningstar classifies Freeman's fund as large-cap growth,
he considers it an "all-cap" fund: "We buy them as small- or mid-cap
stocks and [hope] eventually they grow larger," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Forest Labs and cable television company Comcast Corp., for
example, have been in the fund since its launch 19 years ago, he
said.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, with only about 1% annual portfolio turnover, Freeman is a
buy-and-hold adherent. "There's a lot to be said for Warren Buffett's
philosophy that the ideal holding period is forever," he said.</TE>
<TE>   In recent months, Freeman has put new cash into existing holdings
such as IDEC; into the financial sector, including asset manager
Neuberger Berman Inc. and brokerage firm Lehman Bros. Holdings; and
into defense contractor L-3 Communications Holdings Inc., "whose
business prospects improved, unfortunately, because of the Sept. 11
tragedy."</TE>
<TE>   Freeman believes that investors should take one basic lesson away
from the market's initial dive, then recovery, following Sept. 11:
"Even if the market seems a little scary, in the final analysis you
are buying ... an individual company, and it pays to buy low."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Ken Heebner, CGM Focus Fund, in Boston: Heebner guided this
four-year-old fund to a 53.9% gain in 2000 and a 47.6% surge in 2001.
Its three-year annualized return of 35.1% is in the top 1% of
Morningstar's small-cap "blend" category. Blend funds hold a mix of
"growth" and "value" stocks.</TE>
<TE>   Heebner's fund charter gives him broad leeway in running this
concentrated fund, which typically holds just 15 to 20 stocks,
compared with more than 100 for most funds in this category. He also
employs other techniques that may increase the fund's risk level.</TE>
<TE>   In 2000, Heebner cleaned up by "shorting," or betting against,
tech stocks whose valuations had gotten out of touch with the
companies' earnings potential, he said. Last year he unwound all his
short positions by Sept. 30 but has remained light on tech stocks, he
said, and has benefited from hefty weightings in the home-building
and recreational-vehicle industries.</TE>
<TE>   Home builders such as NVR Inc., Beazer Homes USA Inc. and Ryland
Group Inc. have done well as the housing market has remained
resilient despite the recession. The same has been true of
recreational-vehicle companies Winnebago Industries Inc. and Monaco
Coach Corp.</TE>
<TE>   Yet stocks in both industries remain cheap, Heebner said. "Home
building used to be a business of hit-and-miss entrepreneurs, but
these are established national enterprises, leaders that can continue
to grow market share as the industry consolidates," he said of his
building stocks.</TE>
<TE>   The fund also has stakes in Frontier Airlines Inc., a regional
airline operating from Denver, and in Continental Airlines Inc. The
well-known woes of big industry players such as United parent UAL
Corp., which recently reduced its capacity in Denver, will benefit
the more efficient Frontier, Heebner said.</TE>
<TE>   Though Continental continues to lose money, Heebner believes it is
better managed and has fewer labor problems than most of its major
competitors.</TE>
<TE>   Other holdings include consumer stocks such as Gart Sports Co., a
sporting-goods retailer that recently bought rival Oshman's Sporting
Goods; Tweeter Home Entertainment Group Inc., an upscale electronics
retailer; and Wilsons the Leather Experts Inc., a clothing retailer.</TE>
<TE>   Another chunk of the portfolio is in trucking stocks such as
Yellow Corp., Arkansas Best Corp. and Roadway Corp.</TE>
<TE>   "If you step back and look at the portfolio, it's a strong
statement on a consumer-led recovery," Heebner said.</TE>
<TE>   But with his concentrated style, volatility is a given with this
fund, he warned. "If the home building industry has a bad day, it
will be hard for this fund to do well."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Peter Higgins, Dreyfus Midcap Value Fund, in Boston: Higgins,
whose fund gained 27.5% in 2000 and 17.1% in 2001, has managed the
fund since its September 1995 launch. Its five-year annualized return
of 18.6% is in the top 9% of Morningstar's mid-cap value category.</TE>
<TE>   Investors have noticed, as the fund has seen hefty cash inflows.
Higgins said the fund, which now has more than $1.2 billion in
assets, will be closed to new investors when assets hit $1.4 billion.
He said he wants to stay nimble enough to maintain a true mid-cap
fund.</TE>
<TE>   Whatever money comes in usually gets put right to work: Higgins
stays nearly fully invested, with only about 1% of the portfolio in
cash.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't try to time the market. We have no particular skill in
doing that," he said. "Some managers hold 15% to 20% cash, which
makes little sense to me--you might as well give the money back to
your clients."</TE>
<TE>   Higgins said the secret to successful value-stock investing lies
in "not looking at things as Wall Street does."</TE>
<TE>   "Typically, when a stock is moving down we may be looking at
buying it, and when it's moving up we may be selling it."</TE>
<TE>   Copier giant Xerox Corp., which tumbled from more than $60 in late
1999 to $5 by last spring and now is at about $10, exemplifies the
Higgins approach. "The company has been through various trials and
tribulations over the past 24 months, with accounting issues,
concerns about liquidity, etc.," he said. "There has been a lot of
skepticism over [a] turnaround, and probably justifiably so. But we
think Xerox is making progress. The company has solid-enough assets
and has secured financing from partners such as GE Capital. Its
balance sheet is getting better, and there's also progress on the
cost-cutting front."</TE>
<TE>   Higgins thinks Xerox can earn more than $1 a share by 2003.</TE>
<TE>   Another Higgins holding is fuel refiner Valero Energy Corp. Wide
swings in gasoline prices in recent years have meant volatile profits
for companies in the sector, but with gasoline production down,
demand will eventually catch up with supply, Higgins said.</TE>
<TE>   Valero shares trade for about seven times Wall Street analysts'
consensus earnings estimate of $5.21 a share for 2002, Higgins said.
That's less than half the price-to-earnings ratio of the average
blue-chip stock.</TE>
<TE>   Other fund holdings, as of Nov. 30, included Stilwell Financial
Inc., parent of the Janus and Berger mutual fund groups; Cendant
Corp., a franchiser whose brands include Howard Johnson, Avis and
Century 21; and Agilent Technologies Inc., a maker of measuring
instruments.</TE>
<TE>   On the flip side, Higgins said he sold all his shares in
semiconductor company Conexant Systems Inc. after the stock more than
doubled in the post-Sept. 11 rally. He also trimmed his holdings in
communications equipment maker Scientific-Atlanta Inc., he said.</TE>
<TE>   "We're disciplined sellers. We have a target price for everything
we own."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Karen Reidy, Janus Core Equity Fund, in Denver: Reidy took over
this large-cap growth fund in January 2000 and held its losses to
7.2% in 2000 and 12.1% in 2001--far smaller declines than most Janus
stock funds incurred.</TE>
<TE>   Core Equity, formerly known as Janus Equity-Income, was in the top
21% of Morningstar's large-cap growth category in 2000 and in the top
10% in 2001, both brutal years for the large-cap growth sector.</TE>
<TE>   Reidy, who joined Janus in 1995, had worked as an analyst and
assistant portfolio manager at the flagship Janus Fund.</TE>
<TE>   Core Equity has become more conservative since Reidy took over: In
early 2000, for example, 9% to 10% of the portfolio was in corporate
junk bonds, she said, an allocation now closer to 1% to 2%.</TE>
<TE>   "I want this to be a fund that gets you where you're going but
lets you sleep well at night," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Though Morningstar still classifies Core Equity as a large-cap
growth fund based on its history, the current portfolio is considered
large-cap blend. The fund typically holds 55 to 65 stocks across a
broad mix of industry sectors.</TE>
<TE>   Reidy said she looks for companies with consistent, predictable
business models; accelerating cash flow and return on capital; sharp
management; and attractive valuations--as she put it, "the right
risk-reward trade-off."</TE>
<TE>   "There's a special place in my heart for consistent business
models, as opposed to companies scrambling to make their quarterly
numbers in the last week of the third month," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Major holdings that have the steady revenue streams Reidy likes
include Automatic Data Processing Inc., a payroll processing company;
and global banking giant Citigroup Inc. Other sectors she likes
include manufacturing and media/advertising, two areas walloped by
the recession but that may be bottoming out, she said.</TE>
<TE>   "As an investor, you have to anticipate turnarounds," Reidy said.
"You can't wait for the [positive] data points to present themselves,
because by then the stock prices will have moved up."</TE>
<TE>   Reidy, who held 12% to 13% of the portfolio in cash early in 2001,
has spent that position down to 8% or 9%, she said. "It may not sound
dramatic, but for my style of investing, that's evidence that I'm a
bit more constructive about the market."</TE>
<TE>   Other large positions in the fund as of Oct. 31 included such
blue-chip names as General Electric Co., insurer American
International Group Inc., Exxon Mobil Corp. and 3M Co.</TE>
<TE>   Still, Reidy cautioned that she is a bit less enthusiastic about
stocks' prospects overall than she was three months ago. "The
market's bounce was not really based on fundamental valuations, but
on anticipation, asset allocation [shifts by fund managers] and
liquidity," she said. "The market needs to digest all that.</TE>
<TE>   "It's great to anticipate, but don't chase stocks--and don't
forget about valuations."</TE>

<TE>   John D. Spears, Tweedy Browne Global Value Fund, in New York:
Spears, whose fund gained 12.4% in 2000 and slipped 4.7% in 2001, is
part of a four-member team managing Global Value. He and his partners
have guided the fund to a five-year annualized total return of 12.9%,
landing it in the top 3% of Morningstar's foreign stock fund
category.</TE>
<TE>   For the most part, major foreign stock markets suffered a worse
bear-mauling than the U.S. market in 2001. But Tweedy Browne's
cautious, value-oriented style minimized the damage for its
investors.</TE>
<TE>   The Global Value fund, which concentrates its investments in
Europe, Japan, the U.S. and Canada, keeps portfolio turnover low in
an effort to avoid taxable capital gains distributions, so it hasn't
been making any dramatic moves, Spears said. Its annual portfolio
turnover rate of about 12% is far below average for a stock fund,
according to Morningstar. "We're very cognizant of that big tax bully
out there," Spears said.</TE>
<TE>   When they buy stocks, Tweedy Browne managers pay strict attention
to valuations to help limit risk of loss, Spears said. The idea is
that, when lofty expectations aren't priced into a company's shares,
the downside from potential disappointment may be minimal--as long as
the company is financially healthy, of course.</TE>
<TE>   Spears said Tweedy Browne managers look for companies they believe
are undervalued relative to their intrinsic worth, typically based on
a piece-by-piece analysis of the business' units.</TE>
<TE>   Though the managers rely on a "bottom-up," or stock-by-stock,
selection process, one area they especially like these days is the
drug industry, Spears said. Large holdings include Germany's Bayer,
as well as Pharmacia Corp. and Schering-Plough Corp.</TE>
<TE>   "We like the nature of the business, where patents allow for great
pricing flexibility," Spears said. "And many of these companies have
a strong pipeline of [new] products." Many major drug stocks have
largely been stuck in neutral over the last year, even as the
companies' earnings continued to rise.</TE>
<TE>   Other large positions in the portfolio as of Dec. 31 included
global food and consumer products giants Nestle and Unilever and
British food and alcohol conglomerate Diageo.</TE>
<TE>   One newer holding is ABN Amro Holding, a major Netherlands-based
bank, which is priced at about nine times Tweedy Browne's estimate of
2002 per-share earnings. Also, the stock's annualized dividend yield
is about 5%.</TE>
<TE>   The financial sector has long been a Tweedy Browne favorite,
Spears said, and the hit the stocks took immediately after Sept. 11
provided a good buying opportunity. The fund also holds shares of
MBIA Inc., the largest insurer of municipal bonds in the U.S.</TE>

<LD>Re "True Need vs. True Greed," Commentary, Jan. 2: Looks like I
haven't been pondering alone. The idea of million-dollar settlements
in the World Trade Center attacks bothers me too. Thank you, John
Balzar.</LD>
<LD>   You see, my reason is personal. My father was murdered in October
1996, three months before JonBenet Ramsey. Oh, you remember JonBenet
but not my father? I'm not surprised. You see, his murder is still
unsolved, didn't get a lot of press attention and, needless to say,
didn't get a lot of law enforcement attention either, as it's now
considered a "cold case." And would you believe it? I'm still waiting
for my check in the mail to cover my loss and my grieving. Not to
mention the nightmares I've suffered since reading his autopsy. Oh
wait, that's right. There is no check in the mail. His murder wasn't
political, or should I dare say, important?</LD>

<TE>   Kudos to Balzar for printing what we can only hope has been on the
minds and in the hearts of the apparently silent minority who still
have the common sense to be, at the very least, "bothered" by
displays of greed and pseudo-patriotism. Those engaging in such
displays should be ashamed for infecting the memory of their loved
ones with moral depravity for nothing but money. They overshadow the
true courage, dignity and honor with which many families endure
tragic and sudden personal loss, not only on Sept. 11 but every day
of every year.</TE>

<LD>We were recently advised that on Jan. 1 a new pricing schedule would
take effect covering our retiree health benefits. As of that date the
co-pay for a brand-name drug increases from $30 to $48 and for a
generic drug from $10 to $24. Inasmuch as our prescriptions are about
evenly split, and if my math is correct, this appears to be about an
80% increase.</LD>

we should go after the terrorists in the prescription drug industry.

<DL></DL>
<LD>"Crack of Light in the Mideast" (editorial, Jan. 3) needs to become a
reality. It's evident from the signs appearing in the West Bank and
Israel that it's better to have pains of peace than agonies of war,
and that Arabs and Jews are now ready to heed these words. Also
recall what Gandhi said: An eye for an eye can blind the world. The
time has come in the cycle of life for us to accept peace.</LD>
<LD>   Two peoples inhabit the land in dispute, over which we've engaged
in war too long. Former Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin cried
out: Enough killing! And he died for it. Conflict breeds hate and
acts of war. Peace will have us live in harmony and build a society
that is mindful of our mutual needs as neighbors. Peace in the region
can also help us find peace in the other areas where we engage in
war.</LD>
<LD>   Better these millions for people's needs rather than for
instruments of destruction.</LD>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   You try to impart to your readers the impression that the credit
for the "crack of light" (i.e., current curtailment of hostilities)
is due to recent public declarations of peace by Yasser Arafat and
Hamas. However, the real and painfully obvious reason for the calmer
waters is the tightening of screws by the Israelis with overt
American support.</TE>
<TE>   It is unfortunate that peace and calm could presently be achieved
only by targeted killings of terrorist leaders, a strong military
posture and tight restrictions on travel and other activities of
Palestinians. This will continue until the Palestinians abandon their
prejudice and hatred and learn to peacefully coexist with Israel as a
neighbor.</TE>

<LD>   Racism and racial bias are serious issues, not some tool to be

<HD>Michael Bloomberg: New Mayor for New Era</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg spoke the truth during his
inauguration when he said it was time to be thrifty ("N.Y.'s New
Mayor Sounds Cautious Note," Jan. 2). New York has had enough
problems in the past four months and faces even more as the economic
fallout from Sept. 11 really hits home. A new stadium for the Mets
and Yankees is a luxury that cannot be afforded. And, since former
Mayor Rudolph Giuliani all but ignored education, a lot has to be
done to get the city schools back on track. That will take lots of
money. Bloomberg was also right to advocate cutting city staff and
set a great example by leading the way with cuts in his own office.</LD>
<LD>   Finally, holding the Bush administration accountable to its word
will be tougher than he thinks. After President Bush made those
promises, he also made promises to a host of other needy parties,
committing billions in the process. Fuzzy math aside, it's going to
be interesting to see how Bush comes up with all the money to do it.
But Bloomberg has to press Bush to step up in order to keep New
York's issues in the main spotlight. I wish him all the success in
the world. He won't have an easy time, but he can make history in his
own way.</LD>

<TE>   Los Angeles</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   In "Mayor Mud's Last Hat Trick" (Commentary, Jan. 3), Norah
Vincent refers to Giuliani as "just another petty potentate,
Napoleonically short and short-tempered ... the worm in the Big
Apple."</TE>
<TE>   However, one has to be impressed by this leader who transformed a
city rotting from crime, prostitution, dilapidated buildings and
homelessness. When I visited New York City two years ago, it was a
transformed city. People were walking down Broadway and through
Central Park at midnight. The city was safe. It was clean. It was
beautiful. It was livable. I came back to the San Gabriel Valley and
told my colleagues that if Giuliani can do it in New York City, we
can do it here.</TE>
<TE>   Giuliani is tough. Sometimes you have to be tough. We have too
many people in politics who are weak-kneed toadies for unions,
lobbyists and other special interest groups. Our cities would be
better off with more Giulianis at the helm.</TE>

<LD>Re "Davis Takes Fund-Raising Nationwide," Dec. 30: The Democrats
should stop now. Who wants to elect a governor who is beholden to
financial powers out of state? Should Gov. Gray Davis not first
minister to California's citizens? This same frenetic desperation and
lack of wisdom was seen in the power shortage only a few months ago.</LD>
<LD>   Davis' is an administration of foolishness and panic, searching
for bits of flotsam on the sea of pragmatism, rather than one of
ideas and wisdom for the future.</LD>
<LD>   Who will vote for a man with his heart in an alien state for the
sake of Mammon?</LD>
<TE>   Harry J. Zell</TE>
<TE>   San Gabriel</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Money for Davis' campaign in the next election seems more
important than anything in the state of California. His goal is $50
million? It's best he raise his campaign money in other states where
they don't know him. Too bad he couldn't have worked harder in saving
California taxpayers from the quarter-cent increase in sales tax and
from residents' utility bills doubling in costs.</TE>
<TE>   I hope people will realize when they see their incomes dwindling
and will know who is responsible by election time.</TE>

<LD>No elected official wants to read criticism in letters to the editor
("Assessing the Assessor Reveals Few Assets," Dec. 29), but this is
sometimes how we find that a change in procedures is needed. We are
looking into this matter, to improve response time and let taxpayers
know that their problems are being addressed as quickly as possible
by an agency that oversees 2.3-million properties.</LD>

<LD>Re "New Deficits to Force Boost of Debt Ceiling," Jan. 3: As
predicted by many, President Bush has brought us into another federal
deficit. Treasury Secretary Paul H. O'Neill is diplomatic in blaming
the situation on the recession and the Sept. 11 terrorism attacks.
Those excuses are only examples of the possibilities envisioned when
the majority of Americans opposed Bush's tax cuts.</LD>
<LD>   Republicans will say that this year's extra expenses were
unforeseeable and that they are not to blame. But I would tell them,
based on my personal budgeting experience, that surprise expenses
always come up shortly after you've blown your savings on something
else.</LD>
<LD>   When Bush made the tax cuts, he did so by convincing people that
it was our money in the first place; he told us it was not the
government's. Now that we're again in debt, whose money is it that
will pay back the monthly principal and interest expenses?</LD>
<TE>   Howard Schlossberg</TE>
<TE>   Woodland Hills</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Thank you, President Bush. For the first time in nearly 14 years I
have seen an increase in my pension check. It was a result of your
tax overhaul plan and the resulting reduction in the federal
withholding. I remember when the Democrats in Congress shouted that
this tax plan would only benefit the wealthy. Well, they were wrong,
just as they were wrong to stop the economic stimulus plan.</TE>
<TE>   Young people frequently ask, "What is the difference between
Republicans and Democrats?" Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle
(D-S.D.) has answered that. The Republicans want to stimulate the
creation of new jobs in small companies while the Democrats just want
to increase welfare payments. Wouldn't most people rather have a job
than a welfare check?</TE>

<HD>Using the Four Rs to Pick, Track Mutual Funds</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Staff Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Our tables on these pages are designed to help you pick new mutual
funds and assess the performance of funds you already own.</LD>
<LD>   As with selecting a good diamond, there's a system you can use to
find good funds.</LD>
<LD>   Instead of the four Cs--cut, carat, color and clarity--fund
investors must consider the four Rs-- returns, ratings, risk and
ratio of expenses to assets.</LD>
<TE>   Our lists of funds on these pages are fund tracker Morningstar
Inc.'s top-rated funds, according to its proprietary rating system.</TE>
<TE>   Here's an explanation of the four Rs and how these funds come to
be ranked highest by Morningstar:</TE>
<TE>   * Returns.  Before selecting a mutual fund, you'll want to look at
its track record. Past performance isn't a guarantee of future
returns, but it can be an indication of competence and consistency.</TE>
<TE>   Performance return figures are simple to look up in our charts.
Under the header "Total % Return" you'll see three figures.</TE>
<TE>   The first shows the fund's return in the fourth quarter (the three
months ended Dec. 31). The second shows the overall return in 2001.</TE>
<TE>   The third shows the fund's annualized return over the three years
ended Dec. 31. In other words, it takes the fund's total three-year
net return and calculates what that worked out to on an annualized
basis.</TE>
<TE>   All returns figures are "total returns"--meaning they measure net
price change plus any dividend or interest income.</TE>
<TE>   By comparing each fund's return with its category average for any
given period, you can see whether the fund did better or worse than
the average fund.</TE>
<TE>   There's another way to measure longer-term performance. Look at
the second column in each table--the "3-yr Rnk" column.</TE>
<TE>   This shows how a fund ranks by return over the last three years,
expressed by the percentile in which its performance ranks within its
category. A "1" rank means a fund ranked in the first percentile in
its category; a "100" means the fund ranked at the bottom in its
category.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Ratings and Risk. These two Rs are intertwined, based on the
different rating systems Morningstar uses to judge funds against
their peers.</TE>
<TE>   "Category ratings," which you'll see as the first column of each
table ("Cat Rtg") assess a fund's "risk-adjusted" performance over
the last three years relative to other funds in its specific
category.</TE>
<TE>   The ratings are 1 to 5, with 5 being the best.</TE>
<TE>   What does risk-adjusted mean? Morningstar judges each fund's
overall performance against its downside volatility.</TE>
<TE>   The idea is that you don't necessarily want to earn the highest
returns if a fund also is extremely volatile, swinging wildly in
terms of returns.</TE>
<TE>   High volatility increases the chance of loss if you need to sell
at a bad time, a lesson many fund shareholders learned in the harsh
bear market of 2000 and 2001.</TE>
<TE>   So Morningstar believes consistency of performance, as well as
above-average performance, is important in judging returns--and
whether a fund is a good choice for the typical investor.</TE>
<TE>   You're probably more familiar with the rating system shown in the
third column of our tables--Morningstar's famous three-year "star"
rating ("3-yr Star" in the header), which also has a 1-to-5 scale,
with 5 being the best.</TE>
<TE>   As with the category ratings, the star ratings are handed out on a
bell curve: The highest-rated 10% of funds get a 5, the next 22.5%
get a 4, the next 35% get a 3, the next 22.5% get a 2 and the lowest
10% get a 1.</TE>
<TE>   What's the real difference between the category rating and the
star rating? In awarding stars, Morningstar compares a fund not with
others in its specific category but with others in one of just four
much broader fund groupings: domestic stock funds, international
stock funds, taxable bond funds or tax-free bond funds.</TE>
<TE>   What this means, in effect, is that specific categories of funds
that are out of favor in a given period, relative to the broad
market, will tend to have more funds with lower star ratings.</TE>
<TE>   Conversely, funds in categories that investors have favored
lately, relative to the broad market, will tend to have more funds
with higher star ratings.</TE>
<TE>   For example, many technology stock funds still get five stars
despite heavy losses in 2000 and 2001 because the funds' three-year
returns in many cases remain stellar.</TE>
<TE>   The obvious problem with star ratings: They are backward-looking;
they don't necessarily tell you which fund categories may be starting
to shine.</TE>
<TE>   If you're hunting among fund categories that have just begun to
improve--such as precious metals funds--the category rating in our
tables might be more valuable than the star rating because the former
tells you which funds have performed best in their specific category,
rather than relative to the broad market.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Ratio of expenses. Our tables show each fund's management fees in
the column labeled "Exp Ratio." That measures annual fund expenses as
a percentage of assets.</TE>
<TE>   The average for each category is shown at the bottom of each
table.</TE>
<TE>   If a fund charges more than the average, it should be producing
above-average returns for shareholders as well. If not, you should
wonder what you're paying for.</TE>
<TE>   Keep in mind that some types of funds are more costly to manage
than others. For instance, the staffing needed to properly research
obscure emerging-markets stocks is likely to be greater than that
required for a fund investing in well-known companies at home. So
judge a fund's expense ratio relative to that of its peers.</TE>
<TE>   Funds with sales charges, or "loads," are usually sold by brokers
or other financial advisors and are often a way to pay for advice.</TE>
<TE>   The long-term effect of sales charges is an ongoing controversy,
but it is important to note that return figures and Morningstar
ratings do not take these sales charges into account.</TE>

<HD>Morningstar's Top-Rated Funds</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>With more than 10,000 mutual funds to choose from, many investors
cringe at the task of making selections. With today's special
quarterly fund report, The Times and independent research firm
Morningstar Inc. provide several ways to evaluate funds--including
measurements designed to help investors determine a particular fund's
performance not only overall, but also relative to its peers.</LD>
<LD>   The tables on the next three pages list the best-performing funds
in each of Morningstar's major fund categories over the last three
years (ended Dec. 31), as determined by the firm's proprietary rating
system. That three-year period includes the bull market surge of 1999
as well as the bear market that began in 2000. Only funds with three
years of history are included in Morningstar's rankings.</LD>
<LD>   Here's how the funds were ranked:</LD>
<TE>   * First, each fund has a "category rating" (Cat Rtg), a number
from 1 to 5, with 5 being the best. This rating represents
Morningstar's assessment of how well the fund achieved its three-year
returns relative to the amount of risk it took, compared with its
category peers.</TE>
<TE>   * Second, within each category rating score (e.g., first the 5s,
then the 4s, etc.) funds are ranked by actual three-year performance
within the category as a whole, expressed as a percentile figure (1
to 100, with 1 being best). That is the "three-year rank" column. For
funds with multiple classes (i.e., A and B shares, etc.) only the
best-performing class is included. To determine order, ties in the
first two columns were broken by manager tenure.</TE>
<TE>   * The more familiar Morningstar three-year "star" rating appears
in the third column. The number of stars (again, on a scale of 1
through 5, with 5 being the best) is an assessment of performance and
level of risk for that fund compared with its broader group: domestic
stock funds, international stock funds, taxable bond funds or
tax-free (muni) bond funds. See more detailed information below.</TE>
<TE>   A word about categories: Morningstar does not categorize funds
based solely on a fund's self-description. Rather, it also looks at
each fund's actual holdings to determine category.</TE>
<TE>   The largest groups of funds are domestic equity funds, which
Morningstar organizes by the average size (market capitalization) of
stocks owned and by a fund's general investment philosophy. These
appear on the next page, followed by rankings of bond funds and
sector funds on pages U10-11.</TE>
<TE>   General performance data on the 4,500 largest mutual funds, listed
by family name from A to Z, appear on pages U12-14. Also listed are
funds' telephone numbers, most of which are toll-free. (Note: Some
top-rated funds in Morningstar's tables may not be among the 4,500
largest in the A to Z tables.)</TE>

<HD>Quarter's Best, Worst in 'Growth' and 'Value'</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TOM PETRUNO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The stock market often is a land of sharp reversals of fortune, but
the difference between the third quarter and the fourth quarter of
2001 was one for the history books.</LD>
<LD>   Many of the stock mutual funds that suffered the biggest losses in
the third quarter became the hottest funds of the fourth quarter.</LD>
<LD>   That was true in each of six major fund categories shown below:
the large-stock, mid-size-stock and small-stock subsets of the
growth-stock sector, and the same subsets of the value-stock sector.
Shown are the quarter's 25 best-performing funds and 20
worst-performing funds in each subset.</LD>
<TE>   The performance reversal raises a key question for the first
quarter of this year and the year as a whole: Will the funds with the
greatest fourth-quarter momentum continue to lead the pack, or could
they burn out as quickly as they have flared?</TE>
<TE>   Many or most of the fourth-quarter winners owed their gains to
heavy investments in technology stocks--the same sector that had
caused massive losses for fund managers and their investors in the
first nine months of the year.</TE>
<TE>   Among large-capitalization growth funds, for example, the Fidelity
OTC fund sank 32% in the third quarter, weighed down by a 60% asset
weighting in technology.</TE>
<TE>   But that weighting then helped power the fund to a 29.9% gain in
the fourth quarter.</TE>
<TE>   Among mid-cap growth funds, the tech-dominated Van Wagoner funds
in that category took top performance honors in the fourth quarter,
after racking up some of the biggest losses of any equity funds in
the third quarter.</TE>
<TE>   Even with their fourth-quarter gains, many of the growth-stock
funds that lead the charts on this page still ended the year deep in
the red. Fidelity OTC fund, for example, lost 24.1% for the year.</TE>
<TE>   Red ink for 2001 was less prevalent among small- and mid-cap value
funds that led their respective categories in the fourth quarter.
Many of them rose enough in the fourth quarter that they turned
year-to-date declines as of Sept. 30 into net gains for the full
year.</TE>
<TE>   One example: The Dreyfus Small Company Value fund, the worst
performer in that sector in the third quarter (with a decline of
31.1%), rocketed 41% in the fourth quarter and gained a net 28.6% for
the year.</TE>
<TE>   What that shows is that value-oriented funds aren't necessarily
low-volatility funds, even though value investing often is associated
with relative stability.</TE>
<TE>   Even so, many value-oriented funds did appear to play it much
safer with their clients' money overall last year. Some value funds
that declined the least in the third quarter also posted
smaller-than-average gains in the fourth quarter. For the year,
however, many funds in this sector gained ground or lost less than
the average fund.</TE>
<TE>   The Oakmark Select fund in the mid-sized value category, for
example, eased just 3.8% in the third quarter, when the blue-chip
Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index dived nearly 15%. In the fourth quarter,
as the S&amp;P jumped nearly 11%, Oakmark Select rose 8.3%. For the year
it rose 26.1% while the S&amp;P 500 fell about 12%.</TE>
<TE>   If it's low volatility you seek in a fund, then, one place to shop
would be among the worst-performers lists below, at least in the
value category.</TE>
<TE>   But also be sure to look at a fund's three-year average return and
compare it with the category averages in the table on page U6. Some
value funds have delivered low volatility in the last three years,
but with minimal return.</TE>
<TE>   Others, such as Oakmark Select, have handily beaten their category
average for the three-year period.</TE>
<TE>   Whether your focus is growth or value, if you want to bet that the
stocks that powered Wall Street in the fourth quarter will continue
to have the most momentum in 2002, the fourth-quarter fund leaders
shown here may provide a good starting point for your shopping.</TE>

<HD>Despite a Rough Year for Some, Sector Funds Can Be Solid
Bets</HD>
<DH>The specialty portfolios carry risks but also may be
effective tools for both short-term and long-term investors, analysts
say.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOSH FRIEDMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Technology sector funds led the stock market's fourth-quarter rally,
but they still finished 2001 with an average loss of 38.3%--the
biggest decline of any major fund category last year.</LD>
<LD>   Communications sector funds had almost as bad a year, losing
34.6%, on average, according to Morningstar Inc. data.</LD>
<LD>   And utility sector funds, once thought of as an investing haven
for widows and orphans, tumbled 21.2% in 2001, thanks in part to the
hard-hit telecom stocks many of them hold.</LD>
<TE>   Investors who got used to big winnings in sector stock funds in
the 1990s found out last year just how risky these narrowly focused
portfolios can be.</TE>
<TE>   Yet some financial advisors say sector funds still can be an
effective tool for short-term traders, as well as a good idea for
buy-and-hold investors, if used properly.</TE>
<TE>   Despite a 13.4% loss last year, the average health-care sector
fund has rewarded long-term investors with a gain equivalent to 15.2%
a year over the last five years, according to Morningstar. That far
exceeds the 9.1% annualized gain of the average domestic stock fund
in that period.</TE>
<TE>   Sector funds allow investors "to play offense or defense, or
simply to fine-tune the investment mix," said Jim Lowell, editor of
the Fidelity Investor newsletter in Potomac, Md., which analyzes the
mutual fund giant's 41 sector funds, as well as its other offerings.</TE>
<TE>   "One advantage of sector funds is that they allow you to finely
parse the investment universe," Lowell said. For example, if you have
significant faith in a particular industry but aren't sure about the
best individual stocks to play, you can use sector funds to make a
bet on the industry without limiting yourself to a particular stock.</TE>
<TE>   Sector funds are big business for many fund companies: The
combined assets of eight major stock sector fund categories tracked
by Lipper Inc. total about $180 billion. By contrast, diversified
small-stock funds hold about $150 billion in assets, according to
Lipper.</TE>
<TE>   Because sector funds concentrate on stocks within one industry or
a cluster of closely related industries, they tend to be highly
volatile, naturally gyrating with the fortunes of that segment of the
economy.</TE>
<TE>   Short-term traders can capitalize on that volatility by trying to
ride hot sectors with a portion of their money, said Paul Merriman,
head of Merriman Capital Management in Seattle and editor of the
newsletter FundAdvice.com.</TE>
<TE>   Merriman recommends spreading money earmarked for short-term
sector investment among four fund sectors at a time to limit the
risk. His strategy is to play those sectors that have the strongest
share-price momentum in the last 100 trading days.</TE>
<TE>   But investors trying to play short-term market moves obviously has
to stay fast on their feet, experts say.</TE>
<TE>   "The problem with sector investing is that it's not just important
when you get in, but also when you get out," Lowell said. "If you're
not careful you can end up like Jimmy Cagney [in 'White Heat']
screaming, 'Made it, Ma! Top of the world!' while the natural gas
tank under you is about to explode. You have to be much more vigilant
than with a diversified fund."</TE>
<TE>   Merriman said many of the traders who follow his recommendations
adjust their sector portfolios daily or weekly rather than monthly,
for example. As he put it, "A lot of bad stuff can happen to an
industry in 30 days."</TE>
<TE>   Because of the potential for extreme ups and downs, sector
investing demands discipline if you're a short-term trend player.</TE>
<TE>   "You must be willing to cut your losses short and to go back into
a sector at a higher price than you got out at" if the trend turns
positive again, Merriman said. "In other words, you have to admit
mistakes, which some people can't do."</TE>
<TE>   For short-term traders, Merriman recommends using sector funds
from Rydex or ProFunds, which carry no upfront sales fees and no
redemption charges. (Fidelity Investments' Select sector funds, by
contrast, which carry a 3% front-end sales charge and a redemption
penalty if sold within 30 days, are geared toward longer-term
investors.)</TE>
<TE>   For true daredevils, ProFunds offers funds designed to perform at
roughly 1.5 times the underlying sector--up or down--on a daily
basis, by using borrowed money to amplify their bets.</TE>
<TE>   As of last week, Merriman, whose fund picks are available free via
e-mail service from the Web site SoundSectorStrategy.com, suggested
ProFunds customers be invested in ProFunds Ultra Technology, ProFunds
Ultra Semiconductor, ProFunds Ultra Basic Materials and ProFunds
Ultra Real Estate, and that Rydex customers own Rydex Precious
Metals, Rydex Consumer Products, Rydex Biotechnology and Rydex Basic
Materials.</TE>
<TE>   Looking forward six to nine months, Lowell said one of his
intermediate-term sector recommendations is a defensive play: He
recently upgraded Fidelity Select Gold as "a hedge against the
Fidelity Growth Company fund in times of geopolitical uncertainty."</TE>
<TE>   Lowell's other intermediate-term picks are linked to the idea of a
turnaround in the economy: Fidelity Select Energy and Fidelity Select
Natural Gas, which could benefit from a pickup in manufacturing, and
Fidelity Select Business Services, which could benefit if companies
wary about hiring back employees instead turn to temporary agencies
as a stopgap, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Despite their volatility and popularity with short-term traders,
sector funds can pay off as long-term investments, financial advisors
say.</TE>
<TE>   Financial-services sector funds have gained 12.8% a year over the
last five years, on average, according to Morningstar.</TE>
<TE>   And before the plunge of 2000 and 2001, the average technology
sector fund produced double-digit returns for nine years straight.</TE>
<TE>   The danger is that a sector can go cold for a long period too.
Unlike a manager of a diversified stock fund, a sector fund manager,
by definition, has to stick with a sector through thick and thin.</TE>
<TE>   Precious metals sector funds gained 20.2% last year, on average,
but they've had a dismal last five years as gold has fallen out of
favor. The average fund's five-year annualized return is a negative
11.6%.</TE>
<TE>   The natural resources sector also has been a poor performer over
the last five years, gaining just 3.2% a year, on average.</TE>
<TE>   Lowell said the two sector funds he would feel comfortable "buying
today and leaving in a safe deposit box for 15 years" are Fidelity
Select Health Care, which he said offers growth potential with
relatively low volatility, and Fidelity Select Electronics, which
focuses on computer chip companies.</TE>
<TE>   He said he would steer clear of making long-term bets in cyclical
heavy-industry sectors such as energy, chemicals and autos.</TE>
<TE>   Buy-and-hold investors should be especially mindful of what their
sector fund actually owns, Merriman cautions. "A utility fund cries
out 'conservative' but, as people have found out, it's not
necessarily so," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Blowups such as Enron Corp., the energy trader whose stock
collapsed in the fall when questions arose about its convoluted
accounting, can take a big toll on even standout sector funds,
Morningstar notes. MFS Utilities, which still has a strong long-term
record under manager Maura Shaughnessy, sank 25% last year thanks in
part to the Enron debacle.</TE>
<TE>   Investors also should be aware of trading costs and tax
considerations when using sector funds, experts say.</TE>
<TE>   Sector investors who trade rapidly and generate significant
short-term capital gains may be best served investing via a
tax-advantaged vehicle such as an individual retirement account,
Lowell said.</TE>
<TE>   There also is an alternative to traditional sector mutual funds:
Exchange-traded funds, which track various indexes but trade
throughout the day like individual stocks, provide another way to
invest in sectors. ETFs tend to be tax-efficient, distributing little
in the way of annual capital gains. But they must be bought through a
broker, so commissions are charged. (For more information on ETFs, go
to www.morningstar.com, which has links to brokerage firms offering
the funds.)</TE>
<TE>   Another consideration for sector investors is active versus
passive management. The Rydex and ProFunds sector products and
various ETFs passively mimic sector stock indexes, whereas the
Fidelity Select funds are actively managed. Lowell said Fidelity's
talent pool and research staff can give active management an edge.</TE>
<TE>   No matter which vehicle sector investors choose, financial
advisors caution that sector bets should account for only a small
piece of one's overall portfolio.</TE>
<TE>   Merriman advises investors to diversify the bulk of their stock
fund portfolio among large-cap and small-cap, growth and value, U.S.
and international, with the remaining 15% to 20% reserved for favored
sectors.</TE>
<TE>   Lowell, 41, said he would cap sector plays at 15% of his total
portfolio. "If I were 61, I'd keep it to 10% at most," he added.</TE>
<TE>   "Most important of all," he said, "is picking the right sectors in
the first place."</TE>

<HD>Alternatives for the Cold Season</HD>
<DH>Remedies* Echinacea leads the pack of herbal treatments
that ease cold and flu symptoms. They are considered old standbys for
good reasons.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BARRIE R. CASSILETH</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Over hundreds of years, a host of folk medicines has emerged for
treating colds and flus. None cure, but many reduce the impact of
symptoms.</LD>
<LD>   Echinacea may be the most promising and popular of the herbal
remedies. Dried extracts of this daisy-like flowering plant come in
tablet or capsule form and are almost universally available in health
food stores and pharmacies. Echinacea has been well studied. Its
ability to stimulate immune system activity is the key, and it works
best if used at the onset of colds and flu symptoms.</LD>
<LD>   I always keep a bottle of 500-milligram capsules of echinacea in
my medicine cabinet and in my desk drawer at work. At the slightest
suggestion of a cold, I take two capsules daily with water at
mealtimes, as recommended. There are numerous brands on the market.
Make sure the one you buy is fresh (check the "use by" date) and is
well sealed. Pregnant women and people on prescription medications
should talk with their doctor before taking echinacea.</LD>
<TE>   Several other herbal remedies may be beneficial. They include
astragalus, a traditional Chinese medicine also known as huang qi. It
is believed that this herbal remedy, like echinacea, stimulates
immune system activity. One study reported that astragalus heightens
the production of the cellular protein interferon, stimulating cells
to begin defenses against illnesses, including the common cold. As
with echinacea, proponents recommend that you start taking astragalus
before colds or flu get you down. The root of the plant can be made
into tea; it is also available in capsule form or as a tincture, and
is generally available in health food stores. I don't know of any
reported side effects.</TE>
<TE>   Zinc may well reduce the length of colds if taken at the first
sniffle. You can buy zinc as a throat lozenge or as a spray or gel
(it many be more effective in the latter two forms). Don't use it
within a half-hour of consuming citrus products or soft drinks,
because the zinc will lose its value. Also, never use zinc lozenges
for more than five to seven days--it could suppress immune function,
reducing your body's resistance to all manner of germs.</TE>
<TE>   The old standby of inhaling steam laced with oil of eucalyptus, or
rubbing some of the diluted oil on one's chest, often works to
relieve congestion. Peppermint oil or tea tree oil works in much the
same way. An important note: Herb vapors sometimes cause problems for
asthma sufferers.</TE>
<TE>   Although research results are not consistent, acupuncture and
acupressure may help some people, especially to relieve headaches and
nasal congestion. You can find licensed acupuncturists listed in the
Yellow Pages, and you can check the status of a practitioner's
license by contacting the California Acupuncture Board, a state
agency, at (916) 263-2680 or at www.acupuncture.ca.gov.</TE>
<TE>   Garlic is another old standby. It's often prescribed for its
antibiotic qualities. Garlic comes in oil, capsule, tablet and raw
form and can be taken in moderation with few side effects. Some
research supports the common belief that, taken early and regularly,
it will help prevent colds and flu. It is also said to stimulate
circulation, aid digestion and reduce high blood pressure. Because
garlic is known to decrease the blood's ability to form clots, it
should not be used with anticoagulants or by patients who have
platelet disorders.</TE>
<TE>   Elderberry tea is a longtime favorite for treating the symptoms of
colds and flu. It is also available in powders and capsules, as well
as tea. The tea probably is most beneficial because of the added
value of the heat and steam.</TE>
<TE>   There are, of course, many cold and flu symptom remedies on
drugstore shelves. Remember when shopping the aisles that the FDA
warns us not to give aspirin or other salicylates to children younger
than age 18. Young people can get sick or die from a rare condition
called Reye's syndrome if they take these medicines when they have
cold or flu symptoms.</TE>
<TE>   If you are not sure whether a product has salicylates, ask your
doctor or pharmacist.</TE>
<TE>   And let's not forget what are probably the two most familiar home
remedies for cold and flu season: chicken soup and vitamin C. Studies
have shown that chicken soup might actually work because it contains
a number of substances that may have beneficial medicinal activity
against upper respiratory tract infections, or colds. The news isn't
as good on vitamin C. Megadoses of vitamin C, promoted by the late
Linus Pauling, have never been proved to help.</TE>
<TE>   And for those who favor more conventional therapies, such as
prescription drugs, bear this in mind: Antibiotics--which many cold
and flu sufferers seek out from their doctors--also don't work
against viruses.</TE>

<HD>Size of Tumor May Affect Treatment</HD>
<DH>Breast cancer * Decisions regarding chemotherapy and
tamoxifen may be more complex for some survivors, a study finds.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SHARI ROAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES HEALTH WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Breast cancer patients with large tumors or cancer that has spread
typically undergo chemotherapy or take the drug tamoxifen after
surgery to prevent recurrence of the disease. After all, studies show
that such treatment can improve the chances of a complete cure.</LD>
<LD>   But for women with small tumors--less than 1 centimeter--decisions
about post-surgical treatment may be more complicated.</LD>
<LD>   A new study by Los Angeles researchers, one of the largest to
examine long-term quality-of-life issues for breast cancer survivors,
found that such post-surgical treatment can later impair women's
ability to function. Because women with small tumors have a much
higher survival rate, the risk of impairment could be one they're not
willing to take.</LD>
<TE>   The study, published last week in the Journal of the National
Cancer Institute, compared 763 healthy breast cancer survivors five
to 10 years after treatment. Women who had opted only for surgery
were compared with women who chose surgery plus treatment with
chemotherapy or tamoxifen. Tamoxifen, a drug that blocks the effect
of the hormone estrogen, has been shown to lower the risk of cancer
recurrence.</TE>
<TE>   The analysis showed that women with adjuvant treatment tended to
report more problems with physical functioning, such as sports
participation and household chores.</TE>
<TE>   "Chemotherapy and tamoxifen are very important," says Dr. Patricia
Ganz, lead author of the study and director of the Division of Cancer
Prevention and Control Research at the Jonsson Cancer Center. "They
have saved lives and reduced the death rate from breast cancer
substantially. But for women with tiny tumors, the likely benefits
from adding chemotherapy are quite small. Knowing that there are some
subtle costs may help women decide what to do about adjuvant therapy.
It may help doctors frame the issue better."</TE>
<TE>   While the study shows there are long-term costs to undergoing
additional treatment, there is no clear-cut answer as to whether
women with small tumors should opt for chemotherapy or long-term use
of tamoxifen, Ganz says. The issue has been hotly debated among
doctors in recent years.</TE>
<TE>   "Ultimately, it's the woman's choice," she says.</TE>
<TE>   The study comes at an interesting time, says Barbara Brenner,
executive director of Breast Cancer Action, a consumer organization
based in San Francisco. "We're beginning to see what chemotherapy
means for women's lives at the very time when the push in the medical
community is to give more women with smaller breast tumors
chemotherapy," she says.</TE>
<TE>   The study also showed that younger women tended to report more
long-term quality-of-life issues than women who were diagnosed at
older ages. That finding is in keeping with other studies that show
younger women have more difficulty coping with breast cancer
treatment, Ganz says.</TE>
<TE>   Overall, however, all of the women in the study reported a high
quality of life and no deterioration of emotional or social
functioning five to 10 years after diagnosis. The same group of women
studied one to five years after treatment had complained of various
quality-of-life issues.</TE>
<TE>   "Some of the symptoms they had while on tamoxifen, such as hot
flashes, had diminished," Ganz says. "That is the good-news piece of
this."</TE>

<HD>A Link Between Smoking and Diabetes</HD>

<LD>Swedish researchers say they have discovered another reason pregnant
women should not smoke: It can significantly increase the risk to
their children of developing diabetes as adults.</LD>
<LD>   Dr. Scott M. Montgomery and Dr. Anders Ekbom of the Enheten for
Klinisk Epidemiologi in Stockholm used data from the British National
Child Development Study of about 17,000 births from March 3 to 9 in
1958. The participants had been examined at age 16 and again at age
33, and their mothers' smoking habits were recorded at birth.</LD>
<LD>   The team reported in the Jan. 5 British Medical Journal that
adults whose mothers had smoked 10 or more cigarettes per week during
pregnancy were at least four times as likely to develop Type 2
diabetes as those whose mothers had not smoked. Those who had smoked
as teens themselves had a similar increase in risk. The researchers
speculated that exposure to smoke in the uterus may result in
"lifelong metabolic dysregulation," possibly due to fetal
malnutrition or toxicity of the smoke.</LD>
<TE>   FDA Is Investigating Kava Kava Effects</TE>
<TE>   The Food and Drug Administration said last week that it is
investigating the possibility that the herbal supplement kava kava
can damage the liver. Kava kava is sold to promote sleep and stress
relief. The FDA action follows reports from Germany and Switzerland
that six people suffered liver failure after using the supplement and
that one of them died. In Britain, the Medicines Control Council has
already negotiated the removal of kava kava from stores.</TE>
<TE>   Chelation Falls Short  for Clogged Arteries</TE>
<TE>   Chelation therapy provides little or no benefit in patients with
clogged arteries, a new study affirms. Each year in the United
States, an estimated 500,000 to 800,000 patients receive chelation
therapy in the belief that infusions of ethylenediaminetetraacetic
acid, or EDTA, will remove calcium from plaque, clearing coronary
arteries. But the value of the treatment has never been proven.</TE>
<TE>   Researchers from the University of Calgary and the University of
Alberta studied all patients who had undergone coronary angiography
in Alberta during 1995 and 1996, tracking them for six years. The
team reported in the Dec. 15 American Journal of Medicine that 8% of
the patients were using or had used chelation therapy. Those who were
using chelation therapy were as likely to undergo a coronary artery
bypass as those who did not use it; those who had used it in the past
were more likely to have undergone a bypass.</TE>
<TE>   Killing Bacteria Puts Ulcers at Disadvantage</TE>
<TE>   Killing bacteria in the stomach can reduce the incidence of ulcers
caused by chronic aspirin use, a new study has found.</TE>
<TE>   The gastrointestinal bacterium Helicobacter pylori is the major
cause of stomach ulcers, but long-term use of aspirin and other
non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, or NSAIDs, is also a major
risk factor. Physicians have never been sure, however, how the
bacteria and drugs interact and whether eradicating the bacteria can
make NSAID use safer. Two new studies indicate that killing the
bacteria is a major advantage.</TE>
<TE>   In one study, Dr. Francis K. L. Chan and colleagues at the Prince
of Wales Hospital in Hong Kong studied 100 arthritis patients. All
were given the NSAID diclofenac for their arthritis. Half were also
given antibiotic therapy to eradicate H. pylori and half a placebo.
The team reported in the Jan. 5 Lancet that, after six months, five
of 51 patients in the eradication group had developed an ulcer,
compared with 15 of 49 in the placebo group.</TE>
<TE>   In a separate study in the same journal, Dr. Richard Hunt and his
colleagues at Canada's McMaster University in Hamilton, Ontario,
combined results from 16 studies of NSAID users. They found that
ulcers were more than twice as likely in patients who were negative
for H. pylori infections as in patients with an infection. Both
groups conclude that patients undergoing long-term arthritis therapy
with NSAIDs should have H. pylori infections eradicated to reduce
their ulcer risk.</TE>
<TE>   Steroids Can Ease Sore-Throat Pain</TE>
<TE>   Steroids can ease the pain of a sore throat, according to
researchers at the Mayo Clinic. Dr. Julie Wei and her colleagues
studied 118 sore-throat patients, giving half a pill or shot
containing 10 milligrams of the steroid dexamethasone and half a
placebo. Wei reported in the January issue of the journal
Laryngoscope that 67% of those given the steroid returned to normal
activity in 12 hours, and 84% in 24 hours. In contrast, only 33% of
those receiving the placebo returned to normal activities in 12
hours, and 50% after 24 hours. It did not matter whether patients
took a pill or received an injection of the dexamethasone.</TE>
<TE>   Acupuncture Falters in Study of Cocaine Addicts</TE>
<TE>   Though acupuncture has shown some benefit for treating heroin
addiction, researchers at Yale University have found that the therapy
is of little value in treating cocaine addicts.</TE>
<TE>   The technique, called auricular acupuncture, involves placing
needles in particular points in the ear. It has been used to treat
heroin addicts, and researchers have assumed that it would have
similar value for cocaine addiction. It is offered at more than 400
substance-abuse clinics in the United States.</TE>
<TE>   Dr. Arthur Margolin and his colleagues at Yale studied 620
cocaine-dependent adults. They were randomly assigned to one of three
groups: auricular acupuncture; a similar number of needles placed in
regions not normally used for acupuncture; or relaxation therapy that
involved watching instructional videos. All patients received drug
counseling.</TE>
<TE>   The researchers reported in the Jan. 2 Journal of the American
Medical Assn. that patients receiving acupuncture were no more likely
than patents in the other two groups to reduce cocaine use or to
remain in therapy. Overall, more than half of the subjects dropped
out of therapy during the eight weeks of the program.</TE>
<TE>   Researchers Say Too Much Q Is Harmful</TE>
<TE>   Consuming large amounts of the popular dietary supplement coenzyme
Q, also known as ubiquinone, may be hazardous, according to UCLA
researchers. In a paper in the Jan. 4 issue of Science, UCLA
biochemists Pamela Larsen and Catherine Clarke report that the
supplement accelerates aging and death in Caenorhabditis elegans
worms, which are widely used for studying metabolism. Adult worms on
a diet without coenzyme Q lived 60% longer than those consuming the
supplement, the team found. Ironically, coenzyme Q is promoted as an
anti-aging remedy.</TE>
<TE>   The biochemists believe large quantities of Q will harm humans as
well. "Like cholesterol, coenzyme Q is produced naturally by the body
and cells require it for life," Clarke said. "But like cholesterol,
too much of it is harmful."</TE>

<HD>Setting His Own Pace in the Gym Rat Race</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PAUL BROWNFIELD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>I joined a gym abjectly, the way you're supposed to. Out of shape and
beaten down, someone who could no longer drive to work without
experiencing serious shooting pains down his left leg, the evident
result of a 10-year case of sciatica. My knees ached. I was 36, and I
could no longer kneel or crouch without squinting in pain. Standing
for a prolonged period at social gatherings gave me aches in the
lower back. Still, I had concerns: Wouldn't joining a gym interfere
with my smoking habit?</LD>
<LD>   But I could no longer live in denial, not when there was a gym
only one block from my apartment. Frankly, registering my body at a
gym seemed as mandatory as registering one's car with the DMV. It
seemed, in other words, like the law.</LD>
<LD>   I paid $390 for seven months, plus a $25 joining fee, plus a $50
towel fee. Ian, the manager, began to spin me, but I held him off. I
wasn't shopping around for a better deal. Just tell me how much, I
said, and he did.</LD>
<TE>   The gym, called Meridian Sports Club, has two L.A. locations, one
in Century City and the other, the one I joined, on Wilshire
Boulevard, in the Miracle Mile area, on the bottom floor of an office
building.</TE>
<TE>   As gyms go, it's actually not that faddish or shame-inducing,
meaning the people you see on the weight machines and treadmills,
even the actors, don't look so great.</TE>
<TE>   I knew I wanted to run and do some leg exercises for the sciatica,
and use a lot of towels, but I wasn't looking for all of the other
things gyms implicitly offer you: peace of mind, self-esteem, pecs,
abs, a spouse, life eternal. Well, OK, maybe I was looking for some
abs.</TE>
<TE>   In those early weeks, I began to take some of the classes the club
offered--Body Pump and Boxing Technique and 20-20-20--and had a
complimentary workout with a trainer. He was young and amiable and
soon to be featured in a UPN "reality" series called "Manhunt."</TE>
<TE>   I told him about my out-of-shape legs and he put me on a workout
regimen, one that would strengthen my hamstrings and quadriceps. He
also showed me a machine to work out what I could only think of in a
"Seinfeld"-like way as my man breasts, otherwise known as pectorals.
But the exercises bored me, and two weeks later the regimen was a
memory. When I saw my trainer, I looked away, guiltily.</TE>
<TE>   The classes were easier to stick with, although sampling them was
like trying out for different Broadway musicals. I imagined Bob Fosse
at the front of the room, a cigarette dangling.</TE>
<TE>   Body Pump, a class using barbells with adjustable weights to work
various muscle groups, was taught by a very attractive but humorless
woman who played bad music (that techno-disco stuff that instantly
made me feel preternaturally old) and bossed you into four-count dead
lifts. Boxing Technique was OK, but I'm sorry, hitting a heavy bag
with gloves caked in someone else's dried-up sweat is not my idea of
an ideal workout. Sweatin' on the Ball sounded kind of grotesque, and
as for yoga, well, I can only conquer one planet at a time.</TE>
<TE>   But then there was John. He taught 20-20-20. The class entailed 20
minutes of stretching and ab work, 20 minutes of Spinning (riding
hard on a stationary bicycle) and 20 minutes of warm-down stretches
and some more ab work.</TE>
<TE>   John, God bless him, seemed more interested in giving his charges
the proper workout than in getting a good workout himself. He would
leave his bike while Spinning to make sure you were properly
exercising. He would correct your sit-up technique. And he was funny,
an entertainer in his own right (he was formerly with a comedy troupe
called the Nellie Olesons).</TE>
<TE>   In short, John seemed that rare combination of motivator and
performer--the best side of the cliche that gyms are a repository for
the acting fringe.</TE>
<TE>   I would still be taking 20-20-20 if it weren't for the fact that
it's offered only one night a week, from 6 to 7 p.m. Tuesdays.</TE>
<TE>   If I were super-motivated, of course, I would take The Brains and
Brawn Workout on Thursday mornings at 6 or Morning Boot Camp on
Mondays at 6:45. I would get past the title and take Sweatin' on the
Ball, with Noelle, on Saturdays at 10:30.</TE>
<TE>   But I'm not super-motivated; I'm only motivated up to a point. It
has been a year since I joined.</TE>
<TE>   These days, I get up three or four mornings a week and arrive at
the gym between 6:30 and 7.</TE>
<TE>   For all the enforced structure trainers offer you, I have done
what I suspect most people do--that is, created my own regimen.</TE>
<TE>   It consists of 45 minutes on the treadmill (2.5 miles of running
and 20 minutes of walking at an incline, usually), followed by five
minutes of stretching, followed by 100 or so sloppy sit-ups,
followed, at times, by some machine work on my man breasts.</TE>
<TE>   A year later, I have learned this: Don't expect to look a whole
lot different (although you will tell yourself that you do.) Take
heart if you lose a few pounds, as I did, and can run three miles on
a treadmill without difficulty. But it's not as though I've gleefully
carted my 36-inch-waist pants in a box to the local Goodwill. (This,
I suspect, is mostly because I haven't changed my diet, and, if
anything, I'm just hungrier now.)</TE>
<TE>   Invest in a sturdy Discman, something that keeps the CD from
skipping when you run on the treadmill and doesn't leave you tuning
in the only two stations that can be picked up in the gym--an idiot
morning show on 98.7 FM or National Public Radio. You try working out
to a Daniel Schorr commentary on nuclear proliferation or a Supreme
Court story from Nina Totenberg.</TE>
<TE>   But my sciatica has abated, at least on the drive to work. I can
stand at parties for an hour at a clip. Generally speaking, I feel
better. My knees still hurt, and I still smoke, but there's only so
much happiness a $50 towel fee can deliver.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Carrie Angelakis is living proof that slow and steady wins races.
Though it took her seven years and one very dedicated trainer, the
42-year-old Laguna Niguel resident, who once weighed 185 pounds and
slept away much of her day, is a svelte, head-turning 138 pounds. She
not only runs half-marathons regularly, but also consistently places
in the top five for her age group.</LD>
<LD>   The transformation began in 1992. Six months after her fourth
child was born, Angelakis looked in the mirror and saw an overweight,
depressed woman. Almost too embarrassed to set foot in a gym, she
finally got up her nerve. Once there, she begrudgingly got on the
treadmill and tried consulting with a few of the gym's trainers, with
whom she tended to talk more than exercise. "I was doing everything I
could to avoid working out."</LD>
<LD>   Then she met fitness trainer Nancy Hunsaker. "She didn't let me
get away with anything." Hunsaker gave Angelakis a journal to write
down her goals and track what she ate. When she saw how miserable
Angelakis was inside the gym, she took her outside for walks, which
Angelakis enjoyed. Gradually, Hunsaker incorporated jogging into the
walks by suggesting they jog to the next pole, or the next stop sign.
She kept pushing Angelakis until they ran a mile.</LD>
<TE>   "I couldn't believe it," said Angelakis. "I went back and clocked
it in my car."</TE>
<TE>   To show her gratitude, Angelakis brought Hunsaker goodies, like
Danish and cheesecakes--stuff Hunsaker never touches. "She would
politely take them and later throw them away. That shows you where I
was. My life was about food."</TE>
<TE>   Slowly, however, that was changing. After four months, Angelakis
was running three miles, and Hunsaker signed her up for a 5-kilometer
run. Meanwhile, the weight was coming off, but slowly. After 18
months, she'd gotten down to 168, an improvement, but still 30 pounds
above her ideal.</TE>
<TE>   "That was my fault. I wasn't doing what Nancy said. I was taking
diet pills and drinking alcohol." But Hunsaker hung with her. Some
days Hunsaker would actually bring groceries over and stock Angelakis
up with the foods she should be eating. One day she cleaned out
Angelakis' pantry, throwing away "everything in a box."</TE>
<TE>   Eventually, their persistence paid off. Angelakis began running
longer and harder and eating the way Hunsaker had taught her. The
weight tumbled off, and her race times soared. She hit her goal
weight of 138 in August 1999 and has held it ever since by exercising
regularly and eating carefully. Over the last several years, she's
run a marathon and nearly 20 half-marathons, clocking a personal best
of 1 hour, 37 minutes in the San Diego half-marathon last year,
placing second in her age group. She also placed in her age group in
a 10K last year with a time of 43 minutes, or just under seven
minutes a mile.</TE>
<TE>   "Nancy made me sign up for these races, then would meet me there
to make sure I showed up, then she'd run alongside me. I could cry
when I think of how she changed my life."</TE>
<TE>   Angelakis now runs six days a week, six to 13 miles a day, and
takes Hunsaker's Spin class twice a week. Often on her runs she
invites others along and coaches them to greater distances and to
attend races.</TE>
<TE>   "Running and exercise change your mind," she said. "It's made me a
better person. I used to be so critical because I was so unhappy. Now
I'm a lot more positive. I'm a lot more like Nancy."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   THE CLIENT</TE>
<TE>   * Carrie Angelakis (before) once weighed 185 pounds.</TE>
<TE>   * Now she eats better, weighs 47 pounds less, regularly runs
half-marathons--and says her life has changed.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   THE TRAINER</TE>
<TE>   Nancy Hunsaker, 44</TE>
<TE>   Background: Certified by the Aerobics and Fitness Assn. of America
as both an aerobics instructor and personal fitness trainer.</TE>
<TE>   Personal best: Best time was a half-marathon (13.1 miles) in 1
hour, 18 minutes (just under 6 minutes per mile). She's slowed down a
bit since having five children but still consistently places in the
top three in her age group. Her best time last year was 1 hour, 30
minutes. In 2000, she ran the San Diego marathon in 3 hours, 18
minutes, and last year qualified for the Boston Marathon, which she
finished in 3 hours, 24 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   Key in this case: "Carrie's sense of humor pulled her through. If
I could just get her to laugh, it would take her mind off how hard
her workout was."</TE>
<TE>   Personal fitness routine: When not training for an event, she runs
five days a week five to 15 miles, or a total of 50 to 60 miles;
teaches two advanced Spin classed twice a week at the Sweat Shop in
Dana Point; and does one hour of weight training twice a week.</TE>
<TE>   Philosophy: "I like to get people to focus on a fitness
goal--whether it's walking around the block, getting in shape for ski
season or running a marathon--instead of focusing on the weight loss.
The weight loss follows; it's part of the process."</TE>

<LD>Four years ago, Gaines Newborn felt stuck. He was 16 and living and
going to high school in South-Central Los Angeles. He wasn't doing
well academically, and, though he liked sports, he was "the guy who
never got picked."</LD>
<LD>   The only social scene around was one he didn't want to be part of.</LD>
<LD>   "The peer pressure was really never positive," he said. "Most
activities involved gangs, drugs, alcohol and parties." So he chose,
instead, to spend most of his time at home, in front of the
television, eating.</LD>
<TE>   At 5 feet, 9 inches and 240 pounds he felt disgusted with himself
and socially isolated. Then, in the fall of 1998, he saw a flier
about a flag football team that the Ketchum YMCA was putting
together. He started playing, and there he learned about another YMCA
program called Teen Lead, in which teens meet three times a week for
two hours after school and work on getting in shape and losing
weight.</TE>
<TE>   The program was made to order for Newborn. "I really wanted to
lose weight. I just had no idea how." He also wanted to stay out of
the "devil's workshop," his term for life on the streets. Though his
dad suffered from high blood pressure and heart disease, and his
mom's side of the family struggled with obesity, Newborn says it
wasn't his family's health history that motivated him to make a
change but, rather, "how I felt inside."</TE>
<TE>   Teen Lead trainer Jesse Leon taught Newborn the fundamentals of
fitness. "He told me about fats, protein and carbohydrates, and how
to balance them to lose weight. And he told me to get my cardio up
and stay off the couch."</TE>
<TE>   Soon, Newborn was spending every spare minute he wasn't in school
at the Ketchum YMCA. "The Y quickly became my second home. Every day
I could work out and find a pickup game of racquetball or basketball.
People would open up to me and ask me to play even if I wasn't any
good."</TE>
<TE>   Along with exercise, he ate salads every day for lunch and more
chicken and fish. Three months after joining the Y, he dropped 50
pounds and kept losing. But when all the weight came off, he looked
scrawny, so he started lifting weights to bulk up. Today, at 20 years
old, he's 6 feet tall and weighs 172 pounds, making him 3 inches
taller and 68 pounds thinner than he was at 16. Now, he says, he has
a new type of peer pressure: girls. "They started to notice me."</TE>
<TE>   Other things changed for Newborn, too. "My confidence zoomed up,
my grades zoomed up, my life was more meaningful and I made better
friends." The director of the Y asked him to become a volunteer and
assist Leon with his Teen Lead classes and, two years ago, offered
Newborn a real job helping kids ages 5 to 12 in the after-school
club.</TE>
<TE>   Today, Newborn still works part time for the Y and attends classes
at Los Angeles City College, where he's studying psychology.
Recently, he got promoted to the area he feels most suited for:
helping teens. "They're the ones who really need the help and
direction. That's where the pressure's really at."</TE>

<TE>   THE CLIENT</TE>
<TE>   * Gaines Newborn (before) weighed 240 pounds at age 16, was
socially isolated and felt trapped.</TE>
<TE>   * Now he's lost weight, begun college and gained confidence.</TE>

<TE>   THE TRAINER</TE>
<TE>   Jesse Leon, 22</TE>
<TE>   Background: Certified by the YMCA of USA as a strength-training
instructor and group-exercise instructor. Has worked for the YMCA for
four years.</TE>
<TE>   Personal best: Building a successful program that introduces teens
to a philosophy of fitness and a more positive lifestyle.</TE>
<TE>   Key in this case: "The Teen Lead Program obligated Gaines to come
to the gym three times a week, and after that he was hooked. The bond
he created with the other teens here kept him coming back. A lot for
him was the social aspect."</TE>
<TE>   Personal fitness routine: Stretches daily. Plays basketball five
days a week, two to three hours a day. Does free weights for 30 to 60
minutes, two to three times a week.</TE>
<TE>   Philosophy: "People have the misconception that jogging and
lifting weights will make you healthy, but that's not enough. You
need spiritual and mental health as well. It's not all about looking
better in front of a mirror."</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>I was dismayed to read in the People's Pharmacy (Dec. 17) about
medication being used in the treatment of public-speaking phobia.
Though I do not doubt that propranolol has proved effective for some
people suffering from such phobia, I would like to point out that
there is already a way to treat this problem without
medication--Toastmasters.</LD>
<LD>   Toastmasters is an international organization created to help
people practice their public-speaking and communication skills
through weekly meetings in a supportive environment.</LD>
<LD>   As a member for the past five years, I can assure your readers
that this organization can help them overcome public-speaking phobia,
without the need for any medication whatsoever.</LD>

<LD>"What You Can Do Before the Paramedics Arrive" (Dec.17) was very

taking just a single aspirin if the patient feels a heart attack is

increase the absorption rate in the stomach, rather than having to
wait until the tablet is absorbed.</LD>

<HD>Bikram Yoga Can Strike Healthful Balance</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As a two-year student of Bikram yoga, I believe Hilary E. MacGregor
is too hasty in labeling it as "extreme" ("A Yoga Novice Searches for
the Best Fit," Dec. 24). First, and easiest to reconcile, the body
and mind quickly adjust to the warmth of Bikram studios.</LD>
<LD>   Second, Bikram teachers and instruction vary dramatically in
manner and intensity. Though teachers uniformly speak of the
indoctrination of their training, many of these same teachers, in
their own studios far removed from the Bikram Beverly Hills
headquarters, strike a healthful balance.</LD>
<LD>   The message is clear for Bikram yoga neophytes. Before venturing
opinions or committing yourselves, study and practice for a number of
weeks in the heat of Bikram studios and in the light of personally
balanced instructors.</LD>

<HD>This Couple Decided to Put Old Age in Its Place</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As Marvin and Nina Vida began sizing up the older people around them,
they began to worry. "So many older people have trouble even getting
out of a chair," said Nina, 68. "They tend not to participate, to sit
and say that's too hard, and they atrophy. We didn't want that to
happen to us."</LD>
<LD>   The Huntington Beach couple, who have been married 49 years, had
no intentions of slowing down. Marvin, 71, still works full time as
an attorney, and Nina is a fiction writer who's just finished her
sixth book. But up until 18 months ago, neither had done much
exercise. Both were overweight and out of shape. Furthermore, Nina
struggled with high blood pressure and Marvin with arthritis and back
problems.</LD>
<LD>   "The more I read about exercise, the more I became convinced it
was a good thing for people our age," Marvin said. "But we're not
jocks. Believe me."</LD>
<TE>   They joined a 24-Hour Fitness center but soon realized that
membership alone wasn't enough. They asked to see a trainer and met
Tracy Markley, a specialist in senior fitness. Markley began seeing
each of them separately twice a week, putting them through a routine
that included cardio work, either on a treadmill or exercise bike,
weight training and stretching.</TE>
<TE>   Markley also talked to them about their diet. After some
experimenting, Nina found she did best on a low-fat, low-calorie
diet, while Marvin did better on a high-protein, low-carbohydrate
diet.</TE>
<TE>   After several months, the new regimen lowered Nina's blood
pressure, so she needed less medication to control it, and over a
year she dropped 20 pounds from her 5-foot-6 frame, taking her from
190 pounds to 170. "I'm still not skinny, but I'm skinnier."</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Marvin's weight fell from 250 to 200, he stopped
feeling the ill effects of arthritis, and the chronic back problem
he'd suffered for years disappeared. He became so enthralled with the
benefits of exercise, he converted the couple's garage into a gym,
with a treadmill, a recumbent bicycle, free weights, a universal
weight machine and a fully mirrored wall.</TE>
<TE>   "The cars stay outside because we're more important," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Now Marvin works out in his garage at least four times a week,
doing 30 minutes of cardio work and 30 minutes of weight training per
session. "I look at it this way," Marvin said. "Exercise is my
medicine, and I have to take it. The hardest part is just getting
into the garage to start, but once I'm in, sometimes it turns out to
be fun."</TE>
<TE>   Nina walks on the treadmill for 30 to 45 minutes six days a week
and works with weights once or twice in addition to a weekly session
with Markley. Every weekend the couple take a long hike together. One
of their favorites is the I Think I Can Trail in Crystal Cove, near
Laguna Beach, which takes more than two hours to hike.</TE>
<TE>   "Tracy provided the framework we needed," Marvin said. "She was
encouraging and instructive, and we believed in her."</TE>
<TE>   Though Marvin doesn't see Markley anymore because he's doing well
on his own, Nina anticipates sticking with her weekly session. "I
need the push," she said. "I'll probably see her for the rest of my
life."</TE>

to five days a week. "I work out with my clients and eat right."</TE>

<LD>Maybe it's the cameras, or the stress, or all that foraging for food
and attention, but those televised survivor programs leave
contestants looking pretty tanned and toned. But what if those
contestants had free access to drive-thru fast food; if they had as
much beer as they wanted?</LD>
<LD>   What would you get if you took away the remote island and dropped
them someplace like, say, the Valley?</LD>
<LD>   Another survivor-like TV show, that's what. Starting Thursday, the
Discovery Health Channel will air the first episode of "Discovery
Health Body Challenge," in which three men and three women compete to
see who can make the "most positive lifestyle change," i.e., who can
drop the most weight and look the most fabulous (without having
cosmetic surgery). The suspense will mount as viewers wait for each
episode's "moment of truth," when waistlines are measured, and body
fat calculated, according to the network.</LD>
<TE>   The contestants are not supposed to all look like daytime TV
actors: They include a pastry chef, a mother of triplets, a dock
worker and a police detective.</TE>

<HD>Want to Flush Out a Liar? Watch for That Telltale Blush</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Linda Marsa</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Blushing is often taken as a symptom of embarrassment, but it also
may be a that people are lying. At least, that's the conclusion of
researchers at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn.</LD>
<LD>   Using a heat-sensing camera, they detected a faint blush around
eyes of study participants who were lying; the blush, researchers
say, is a sign of deception.</LD>
<LD>   In an experiment involving 20 Army recruits, some participants
were assigned to stage a fake robbery by stabbing a mannequin and
stealing $20 from its clothing; others were assigned to avoid the
"crime." They were then interrogated, and their responses were filmed
using a high-resolution thermal imaging camera. Six of eight of the
"robbers," who were told to lie about their exploits, exhibited that
faint blush around the eyes, which researchers believe is a primitive
fright-flight response that's triggered when people are being
deceptive. In contrast, 11 of the 12 recruits withstood this thermal
scrutiny and were correctly deemed innocent. (One blushed despite
being innocent.)</LD>
<TE>   Criminologists aren't convinced that this heat-sensing technology
would accurately predict guilt or innocence in real-life situations.
Still, Mayo Clinic researchers plan further tests to investigate
their potential security applications.</TE>

<LD>No one can accuse Alzheimer's disease researchers of pushing a magic
pill or simple solution. The best protection against the disease is
apparently an extremely successful, creative and challenging
life--with plenty of time for leisure.</LD>
<LD>   After showing that well-educated, accomplished retirees have a
less-than-average risk of developing dementia, researchers reported
last week that leisure activities also guard against the disease.</LD>
<LD>   Columbia University neurologists recruited a group of 1,772
mentally lucid New Yorkers age 65 and older and tracked them for up
to seven years.</LD>
<TE>   The retirees detailed their own interests and activities, from
reading or visiting friends to seeing a movie or playing cards. After
taking into consideration other influences, such as education and
occupation, the researchers found that those who had more than six
regular hobbies or leisure activities were more likely to do better
on memory tests than those with only a few activities.The researchers
don't know why the weekly bridge game might keep us lucid, but they
suggest that activity itself might be a preservative.</TE>
<TE>   Like the body, the mind seems to fare better when it's moving.</TE>

<HD>Diabetics Get Sweet Bit of News</HD>
<DH></DH>

<LD>Take heart, diabetics. Sugary sweets are no longer Public Enemy No.
1. In fact, you can occasionally indulge a craving for a candy bar or
other formerly forbidden treat, as long as you watch your overall
intake of carbohydrates, according to revised nutritional guidelines
from the American Diabetes Assn.</LD>
<LD>   The guidelines put new emphasis on managing the disease through
diet and exercise. They reflect research showing that regular
exercise helps people with diabetes lower their blood sugar--and can
help prevent it in those at risk of acquiring Type 2 diabetes through
genes or obesity.</LD>
<LD>   The decision to allow occasional sugar reflects a recognition that
sugary foods may not boost blood sugar more than other carbohydrates
that the body breaks down into sugar. But, if you choose to eat them,
you must factor them into your carbohydrate intake for the day, and
take enough insulin or other diabetes medication to keep your sugar
levels from surging.</LD>
<TE>   The new guidelines, meant to help the country's 16 million
diabetics, recommend against planning meals based upon the glycemic
index, which places a numeric value on foods based upon how much they
will raise blood sugar.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, the new approach looks to the total carbohydrates in
snacks and meals, rather than their particular source.</TE>
<TE>   The guidelines, which reflect scientific evidence accumulated
since they were last updated in 1994, appear in the January issue of
the association's monthly research journal, Diabetes Care.</TE>
<TE>   The revisions give more weight to prevention. And they discourage
fad diets, such as high-protein, high-fat, low-carbohydrate plans,
which may produce weight loss in the short term, but haven't been
shown to produce lasting weight control--a critical goal in diabetes
control.</TE>

<HD>Proper Bench Press Works Chest Muscles</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEPHANIE OAKES</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Question: How do I perform a proper bench press to really work my
chest muscles?</LD>
<LD>   ANNE BRUMBAUGH</LD>
<LD>   Kansas City, Mo.</LD>
<TE>   Answer: To be certain you're performing a bench press properly:</TE>
<TE>   1. Maintain a five-point contact throughout the entire exercise,
both to stabilize your body and to keep you in the correct
biomechanical position.</TE>
<TE>   * Keep your feet flat on the ground.</TE>
<TE>   * Keep your shoulder blades flat and in constant contact with the
bench (do not let them come off the bench).</TE>
<TE>   * Keep the back of your head in contact with the bench.</TE>
<TE>   * Keep your glutes in constant contact with the bench.</TE>
<TE>   * Avoid arching your back when you execute the pressing movement.</TE>
<TE>   2. Use a wide hand grip. This will place more emphasis on your
pectoral muscles. Bench pressing requires the use primarily of your
pectorals major, triceps and deltoids. If you choose a narrow grip
(within shoulder distance), you'll place the weight load more on your
triceps and shoulders.</TE>
<TE>   3. The bar or weights should be in line with where your
collarbones meet your sternum. When you lower the bar it should come
2 to 3 inches from your sternum. Press the bar back up so that is in
the starting position again in line with your superior sternum (just
below your chin).</TE>
<TE>   4. The correct movement for pressing should simulate an arc. (If
you press up in a straight line, it will place undue stress on your
shoulders.)</TE>

<HD>Worthwhile Guidance on Exercise Is a Few Clicks Away</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BENEDICT CAREY</AU>
<BD>TIMES HEALTH WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Some New Year's resolutions are washed away by the champagne on Dec.
31, and others dissolve during the year's first hangover, like so
many seltzer tablets. But there's good evidence that fitness vows
often survive a little longer: Many health club membership rolls
swell fastest during January, and personal trainers often sign up
many new clients after the first of the year. It's not cheap: Fitness
costs can rival car payments. Before taking the leap--or leaping into
any new fitness regimen, experts say--it's worth looking online for
guidance.</LD>
<LD>   Columbia University Health Education Program</LD>
<LD>   www.goaskalice.columbia.edu</LD>
<TE>   Columbia University experts cover a lot of ground on the Go Ask
Alice site, providing "nonjudgmental information ... about physical,
sexual, emotional and spiritual health." The fitness section is
especially good, answering such questions as: Which matters more for
weight loss--speed or distance? Is it safe to exercise beyond my
maximum heart rate? Do bodybuilders need more protein? The answers
often surprise, and they manage to be readable and technical at the
same time.</TE>
<TE>   The discussion of maximum heart rate, for example, reviews the
origin of the concept, questions its adequacy and then offers other
measures of fitness--such as how quickly heart rate falls after
exercise. The site produces tables and numbers whenever appropriate.
In responding to a question about the accuracy of exercise machine
calculations, for instance, Alice gives a table showing caloric
expenditure per minute for a variety of activities, from aerobics to
using a stair-climbing machine. There are also entire sections on
weight training and stretching. The biggest failing of the site is it
leaves you wanting more--more answers to more questions.</TE>
<TE>   American Heart Assn.</TE>
<TE>   www.justmove.org</TE>
<TE>   This is a no-frills site and seems mostly aimed at middle-aged and
elderly people. Its primary value is in giving visitors some idea of
how much huffing and puffing is appropriate for their individual
needs. In the feature My Fitness, for instance, the site divides
consumers into three groups: "low active," or occasional, exercisers;
"active" regulars; and "special needs," people who are limited by
such diseases as arthritis or diabetes. For each group, the site
explains how to calculate target heart rates and body composition and
gives tips on how to start an exercise program that's not too
demanding or boring. To get a more tailored routine, consumers can
register and keep an exercise diary. The Web is replete with sites
that provide similar services. But the AHA does it for free, and the
information is authoritative.</TE>
<TE>   American Council on Exercise</TE>
<TE>   www.acefitness.org</TE>
<TE>   ACE is a San Diego nonprofit organization that certifies fitness
professionals, including personal trainers, and acts as a watchdog to
protect consumers from bogus exercise gimmicks and frauds. The site's
best feature is called ACE Fit Facts, a miscellany of handy advice on
how to choose a fitness trainer, how to evaluate equipment,
supplements and sneakers, home videos, home gyms and so on. There are
even suggestions on how to evaluate an online fitness trainer. When
it comes to assessing equipment, ACE is especially good; the group
tends to be skeptical of new gizmos and recently has helped debunk
electronic abdominal stimulators, among other things. The one glaring
feature the site lacks is some interactive training program--a
calculator of some kind that would give people a sense of what
exercise is needed, based on their individual history and needs.</TE>

<HD>Swimming Gave Her a Heart of Gold</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When Inger Jessen took the gold medal in swimming at the 1999
Transplant Olympics in Budapest, Hungary, at the age of 58, she did
it for a 19-year-old boy who died in a car accident and his family.
They had made it possible.</LD>
<LD>   But there was a time when Jessen, who lives in Huntington Beach,
couldn't walk across a room, let alone swim across a pool. At 39, she
had been diagnosed with cardio sclerosis, an inherited condition that
causes rapid buildup of plaque in the coronary arteries. The same
heart condition killed her father at age 60 and her son when he was
only 30. Over the years, she had double bypass surgery, angioplasty,
triple bypass surgery, a valve repaired and a stent placed in one of
her blocked arteries. But even after all that, her heart was still
failing. Her only hope, doctors told her in 1994, was a heart
transplant.</LD>
<LD>   As she waited for her number to come up, Jessen felt her condition
worsen.</LD>
<TE>   "I couldn't breathe very well or even walk from the car into the
house without help." The call came in May 1997. Within the hour, she
was at USC preparing for her life-changing surgery.</TE>
<TE>   It was while taking a water aerobics class at her local YMCA as
part of her therapy that she heard about the World Transplant Olympic
Games coming up in Budapest and decided, though it was a long shot,
to try to compete. She found swim coach Mike Ruffner through a local
college. Although they only had two months to train before the games,
Ruffner told her: "If you believe you can get there, I'm the guy who
can help you."</TE>
<TE>   They trained five days a week, starting slowly with a lot of
monitoring. At every session they worked on stroke mechanics, speed
and endurance. At the games, her first event was the 50-meter
breaststroke, which, she said, she swam in honor of the family who
made her new heart possible. She won the gold. The next day, she won
the bronze in the 100-meter breaststroke.</TE>
<TE>   At the U.S. Transplant Games in Orlando, Fla., in 2000, she again
won the gold in the 50-meter breaststroke, and at the 2001 World
Transplant Games in Kobe, Japan, she took home the silver. Along the
way, she lost 35 pounds. At 5 foot 6, she weighs 165 pounds and plans
to lose more. At 60, Jessen swims the 50-meter breaststroke in 59
seconds, which, if she were competing in a normal masters group in
her age group, would place her in the top 10, says Ruffner.</TE>
<TE>   To keep her competitive edge, Jessen walks a mile a day, attends
her water aerobics class three days a week and works out with Ruffner
five days a week for an hour and a half.</TE>
<TE>   Her sights are set on the 2003 Transplant Games in France, for
which Ruffner has high hopes for his student: "We have not yet peaked
in terms of her potential."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   THE CLIENT</TE>
<TE>   * Inger Jessen (before), who was diagnosed at 30 with a heart
ailment, could barely cross the room before her heart transplant.</TE>
<TE>   * Now 60, she has won medals at the U.S. Transplant Games and the
World Transplant Games and has set her sights on the next
international competition in 2003.</TE>
<TE>   * She can swim a 50-meter breaststroke in 59 seconds.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   THE TRAINER</TE>
<TE>   Mike Ruffner, 36</TE>
<TE>   Background: Part-time swim coach for Newport Beach Aquatics Swim
Club. Took five athletes to Olympic trials in 2000 games. Has coached
swimming professionally for 15 years.</TE>
<TE>   Personal best: Ranked No. 1 in the world in his age group for 100-
and 200-meter breaststroke. Won national championship last August.</TE>
<TE>   Key in this case: "Inger is very positive, and that makes my job
easier. Many skeptics told her she would always be restricted. I
didn't believe that was any way to go through a second chance at
life. And neither did she."</TE>
<TE>   Personal fitness routine: Swims six times a week for one hour and
15 minutes. Light calisthenics (50 push-ups and 500 sit-ups) daily.</TE>
<TE>   Philosophy: "So much of athletic success is mental power. They
said Barry Sanders was too small to play football, they said Mugsy
Bogues was too short to play basketball.... When people say they'll
never have the body they want, I say that's your choice."</TE>

<HD>The Fitness Remedy</HD>
<DH>Serious ailments often get people serious about exercise.
Five found success after they turned to skilled personal trainers to
guide--and goad--them to better health.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARNELL JAMESON</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>For some, disgust is the motivator--a naked look in the mirror, a
glance at the scale, a pair of pants they can no longer snap. Others
watch preventable diseases undermine the lives of friends and
relatives. And a few start something--a job, a life chapter, a
year--and decide to make the changes more widespread.</LD>
<LD>   But whatever impetus drives the unfit to confront their unhealthy
ways, one thing is certain. When the student is ready, the teacher
will come.</LD>
<LD>   Harvey Lauer, president of American Sports Data in Hartsdale,
N.Y., estimates that there are 88,000 personal fitness trainers in
the United States. Most of them, he says, are concentrated on the
coasts.</LD>
<TE>   The Los Angeles area has more than its share. "Southern California
probably ranks among the top regions of the country in terms of the
sheer number of fitness trainers available," says Pat Ryan,
spokeswoman for IDEA Health and Fitness Assn. in San Diego. IDEA, a
national fitness organization, counts 8,000 personal trainers among
its members. One out of eight is in Southern California.</TE>
<TE>   Although there will always be celebrity trainers helping beautiful
people become more beautiful, most trainers help people who, because
of their health problems, need to exercise and eat better.</TE>
<TE>   These include people with heart disease, diabetes, arthritis,
depression and social isolation--mental and physical troubles that
are often the bedfellows of an unfit lifestyle.</TE>
<TE>   Trainers, say those who have used them, provide more than a role
model and instruction in fitness-related matters.</TE>
<TE>   They hold clients accountable, track progress, coach their charges
through those dreaded but inevitable plateaus and, if all goes well,
turn a client's too-often-fleeting motivation into permanent change.</TE>
<TE>   When the timing and the trainer-client combination click, as
happened in the five success stories that follow, great changes can
happen. And just as not one of these converts believes he or she
could have succeeded without the trainer, the trainers credit their
clients, who had the will, persistence and desire. They know that for
people to achieve long-term weight loss and make regular exercise a
way of life, the change has to happen inside first.</TE>

<LD>Health-minded coaches can be found at gyms, local colleges, through a
doctor, or just by looking in the phone book. Because credentials and
chemistry count, make sure both are a fit.</LD>
<LD>   * Decide how often you want to see a trainer. Some people need
frequent support. Others need to be assessed and started on a
program, perhaps initially meeting the trainer two or three times a
week, then once or twice a month.</LD>
<LD>   * Choose where to meet. Maybe you need the trainer to come to your
home, or maybe you'd rather meet at a gym or studio where there's
more equipment.</LD>
<TE>   * When interviewing trainers, ask about their background and
credentials (they should be certified by a nationally recognized
organization), as well as the types of clients they most typically
work with. In other words, do they specialize in heart patients,
elite patients, seniors or the obese? Check to make sure the trainers
know CPR, and ask how your progress will be charted. Get references
from other clients.</TE>
<TE>   * And, of course, talk money. Costs for one hour with a personal
trainer range from $20 to $75; most charge between $25 and $50. You
can often get multi-session discounts, and split the fee if you make
it semiprivate and work out with your spouse or a friend. The costs
do add up, but most advocates see the money spent as an investment in
their health. It's cheaper than illness.</TE>

<HD>Crash Diets Are a Road to Failure</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>AMANDA URSELL</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The big temptation after a holiday season of overindulgence is to
head straight for the latest quick-fix weight-loss scheme.</LD>
<LD>   But if you want to start 2002 as you intend to live it--by getting
a grip on a weight problem--then the best resolution you can make is
to not "go on a diet."</LD>
<LD>   Why? Because "going on" a diet immediately implies that you will
be "coming off" it. The more stringent the diet's rules and the more
draconian its restrictions, the sooner this is likely to be. Also,
sudden and severe calorie restrictions are bad for your body. They
lower the metabolic rate--the speed at which you normally burn
calories--which in turn makes weight even harder to lose.</LD>
<TE>   So-called crash diets have other side effects as well. When weight
reduction is rapid, you lose more than fat. Water constitutes some of
the total loss, but, more important, so does muscle tissue, further
reducing the metabolic rate. And the leaching of calcium and
phosphorus from bones increases the risk of fractures and
osteoporosis.</TE>
<TE>   Also, coming on and off diets can leave you feeling like a
failure, lowering your self-esteem, sparking bouts of bingeing.</TE>
<TE>   To safely lose weight in 2002, you must learn to separate fact
from fiction, distinguishing slimming fads and scams from those
methods that will work long-term.</TE>
<TE>   First, be wary of anything that claims to be "new" or
"revolutionary." Most diets are simply rehashes of previous ones,
because ultimately, calories come from just four sources:
carbohydrates such as bread, pasta, rice, fruits, vegetables and
sugars; protein such as meat, fish, eggs and chicken; fats such as
butter, cream and oils; and finally alcohol. Whatever the author of
any diet claims, you put on weight if you eat more calories than your
body needs; you lose weight if you eat fewer. Regardless of hype, no
foods have any special weight-reducing properties. Any food eaten to
the exclusion of others (such as consuming protein at the expense of
carbohydrates) can lead to dropping pounds, but this is because you
eat fewer total calories.</TE>
<TE>   The problem with such plans is that chopping out a food group
chops out the nutrients they supply, which in the case of
carbohydrates include B vitamins, the minerals zinc and selenium,
plus fiber.</TE>
<TE>   Also, be wary of diets that claim our blood types determine which
foods we should eat to burn off the blubber. There is no documented
mainstream scientific literature to back up such a theory. Nor is
there evidence for the premise that certain foods should not be eaten
at the same meal for fear of "confusing your enzymes." Foods are
meant to be combined within mealtimes, with the vitamin C in an
orange, for example, improving the absorption of the iron from meat
and cereal foods.</TE>
<TE>   Americans currently spend more than $23 billion a year on
weight-reducing programs, products and services. This year, make a
new type of New Year's resolution and instead of adding yet more to
this colossal revenue, just be honest with yourself.</TE>
<TE>   Write down everything you eat for a week and how much you
exercise. Reduce the former a bit, increase the latter a bit and do
this for the rest of the year. You'll lose weight, and it won't cost
you a cent.</TE>

<HD>Caring for Elderly Uncle Changed His Outlook</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When a family crisis required Chris Wrenn, 48, of Pasadena to spend a
few days caring for his elderly uncle, the experience proved life
changing. Adult-onset diabetes had left Wrenn's uncle virtually
blind, reliant on a wheelchair and totally dependent on others.
Wrenn, who then weighed 247 pounds, also had adult-onset diabetes. "I
looked at my uncle and saw my future."</LD>
<LD>   That's when Wrenn, a chief estimator for a national construction
company, took a leave from his job to get his health under control.
In April 2000, he joined the Pasadena Athletic Club, where he met
fitness trainer Dorothy Waterman. "I needed to make a lifestyle
change to make sure that didn't happen to me," he said.</LD>
<LD>   Wrenn also saw his doctor, who already had him on four medications
for his diabetes; he told Wrenn, again, to lose weight and referred
him to a nutritionist.</LD>
<TE>   Today, Wrenn, who is 5 feet, 10 inches, is 65 pounds thinner, and
at 182 pounds weighs less than he did in high school. His body fat
went from 32.9% to 19.9% (for men, the ideal body fat ratio is
15-18%; for women, 18-22%); and he takes only one medication to
control his diabetes. Soon he may be able to drop that.</TE>
<TE>   To get to this point, he met with Waterman twice a week. She put
him on a cardiovascular program and worked with him on strength
training. At home, Wrenn rode his bike 12 miles to 15 miles a day six
days a week. Eventually he also started taking a spinning class twice
a week.</TE>
<TE>   But exercise was just part of it. "I concentrated on exercising
one hour a day, but I concentrated on my diet 23 hours a day," he
said. His nutritionist put him on a low-carbohydrate diet and
emphasized portion control. To keep his sugar levels from spiking,
she recommended he eat five small meals a day instead of three large
ones. "I didn't trust myself to make choices," Wrenn said, "so I
often ate the same thing every day."</TE>
<TE>   After three months, he gradually returned to work. He now works
full time but leaves early three times a week to work out and
continues to see Waterman twice a week. Although he estimates that
he's spent thousands of dollars over the last 18 months on new
clothes (he's gone through three wardrobes as his waist size has
shrunk from 44 inches to 36 inches), he figures "a couple months in a
nursing home can easily cost that--besides, I've probably prolonged
my life 10 years."</TE>
<TE>   He swears he'll never go back. Years ago, he lost a lot of weight
and regained it all. That won't happen this time, he says, for two
reasons: Back then he didn't have the specter of disease motivating
him, and this time he knows that diet and exercise are forever. "When
I start slipping, I just look at a picture of me before I started all
this."</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, he's getting in even better shape. Over the last couple
of months he has begun swimming, has taken several 50-mile bike rides
and is considering a triathlon.</TE>
<TE>   "Once you lose that weight, you feel so much better," he says. "It
affects everything, your outlook, your personality. So much more is
possible."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   THE CLIENT</TE>
<TE>   * Chris Wrenn (before) weighed 247 pounds and had adult-onset
diabetes. He saw his future in his disabled uncle.</TE>
<TE>   * He went through three wardrobes as he lost weight.</TE>
<TE>   * Now he weighs less than he did in high school.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   THE TRAINER</TE>
<TE>   Dorothy Waterman, 46</TE>
<TE>   Background: American Council on Exercise certified fitness
trainer. Post-rehabilitation therapist certified by the American
Academy of Health and Fitness Professionals. Has private clients and
also works with members of the Pasadena Fitness Club, where she
teaches spinning, kickboxing, muscle training and water aerobics.</TE>
<TE>   Personal best: Completed the 2000 Florida Ironman triathlon in 12
hours, 53 minutes. (The event consists of a 24-mile ocean swim,
112-mile bike ride and a 26.2-mile run.) Last year won first place in
the Bonelli Olympic Distance Triathlon, a 1,500-meter swim, 24-mile
bike ride and 6.2-mile run.</TE>
<TE>   Key in this case: "Chris' commitment and willingness to work on
his own."</TE>
<TE>   Personal fitness routine: Teaches three spinning classes, two
weightlifting classes and two kickboxing classes a week. On his own,
does three short runs (three to six miles), one long run (eight to 15
miles) and one 40- to 60-mile bike ride a week. Increases routine
when training for an event.</TE>
<TE>   Philosophy: "Trainers are like therapists; the best any of us can
do is help people make the changes they're ready to make."</TE>

<TE>   In the mid-19th century, long before diamond and gold mining
interests brought Britain into conflict with South Africa's Dutch and
Huguenot settlers in other parts of the country, the British had
established a presence in South Africa in the subtropical province of
Natal and its chief port, Durban.</TE>
<TE>   Insofar as the British raj had an outpost in South Africa, this
was it, complete with stuffy clubs, colonial architecture and even
immigrants from India. The majority of the region's population,
however, then as now, were the Zulus, who fared badly under the
British and even worse under the repressive policy of apartheid
instituted by the Afrikaner Nationalist government, starting in 1948.</TE>
<TE>   Durban is one of the "empire settings" of David Schmahmann's
thoughtful, affecting and skillfully constructed first novel about
the dilemmas--romantic, fiduciary and financial--confronting a white
South African who immigrated to the U.S. in the wake of a forbidden
love affair in the late 1970s, when interracial unions were still
outlawed.</TE>
<TE>   Twenty years later, as the novel opens in Boston (another former
outpost of empire), the protagonist Danny Divin is in his 40s, a
successful financial consultant, still married to Tesseba, the
free-spirited American woman who impulsively and altruistically
offered to wed him when he was young and struggling to establish
grounds for citizenship.</TE>
<TE>   Yet all these years, he has been carrying a torch for Santi, the
mixed-race (half-white, half-Zulu) woman he fell in love with in
Durban. Now, in the new post-apartheid South Africa, there are no
laws against interracial marriage.</TE>
<TE>   But, as Danny often finds himself thinking, there's been a lot of
water over the dam since then. Unresolved feelings for the woman he
left behind are only one aspect of the complicated loyalties and
values with which Danny has been living.</TE>
<TE>   There's also the continuing problem of his relationship with his
mother, Helga, a formidable woman who became a prominent foe of the
apartheid regime in the 1960s.</TE>
<TE>   Now living in London with her second husband, a man Danny loathes,
Helga is a daunting bundle of contradictions.</TE>
<TE>   She deplores racism, although when they were still living in South
Africa she insisted, out of a sense of loyalty to the country, that
Danny serve his time in an army engaged in the suppression of black
resistance movements.</TE>
<TE>   While her first husband, Danny's father, was an ethical
businessman who supported her political career, her second husband is
a coarse, shifty businessman who has been urging her to use
underhanded ways to get her family fortune out of South Africa. When
Danny demurs, she declares: "I raised you too decent for your own
good."</TE>
<TE>   So when, after all this time, Danny decides to revisit the Durban
of the new South Africa, he must confront questions of love, money
and family loyalty. Schmahmann has no problem generating suspense as
he portrays the various conflicting pressures affecting his
protagonist. One way in which he illuminates the complexity of the
situation is by introducing the voices of other narrators.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to Danny, who narrates the novel's first and final
sections, we hear from his mother, Helga; from his sister, Bridget;
from the Divins' former cook, Baptie, still living in South Africa;
and from Santi, Danny's first love, now teaching at a university. The
personae and their voices are convincingly distinct, and each of
their narratives provides a fresh perspective on the others.</TE>
<TE>   Schmahmann's portrayal of South Africa, past and present, is as
poignant--and as nuanced--as his delineation of the characters and
their relationships. Focusing on one man's struggle with loyalties
and identity, "Empire Settings" also sheds light on the larger issues
confronting a country in the process of reshaping its identity.</TE>

<DH>Maria Adaimy and her team of nit-pickers rid heads of lice.</DH>

<AU>ALLISON B. COHEN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Eight-year-old Samantha walks begrudgingly through the door. For the
next hour or so the Tarzana girl will sit in a tall bamboo chair at
Hair Fairies, a salon on trendy 3rd Street in Los Angeles near the
Beverly Center.</LD>
<LD>   But she's not there for a trim, a tint or even kicky braids. She's
there to be nit-picked. To have someone methodically section off and
comb nearly every strand of hair in search of lice, those pesky, but
not harmful, parasites that can take up residence in youngsters'
locks, no matter how clean.</LD>
<LD>   As Samantha tosses her long dark blond hair forward, she sighs.
"Oh, I wish I had my Gameboy, like last time. How long is this going
to take?" she asks on this, her second of what will be three visits.
Her mother had discovered the second-grader's infestation while
blow-drying Samantha's hair.</LD>
<TE>   "I called a friend in a panic," says Samantha's mother, Rikki, 42,
"She told me to call the Hair Fairy."</TE>
<TE>   For $65 an hour, Maria Adaimy, 31, will search and destroy lice
and their eggs--known as nits--from the scalp of anyone who might
have had head-to-head contact with the infested. "Most children won't
sit for their parents, but they'll sit for me," Adaimy says. An
average treatment requires three or four visits lasting about an hour
a session.</TE>
<TE>   Most children sit quietly in submission, their heads bowed as if
in prayer for the whole ordeal to end. "About 70% of the kids are
usually very cooperative," Adaimy says. "The others cry and squiggle
and are just miserable--mostly 3- or 4-year-olds."</TE>
<TE>   The parents often can be just as anxious, peppering Adaimy with
such questions as: "Do lice jump or fly?" ("No," she says.) "How did
my kid get this?" (Hard to tell. "It's like trying to track the
common cold," Adaimy says.) And most of all: "Why? Why? Why did this
have to happen to us?"</TE>
<TE>   "It's an epidemic," says Adaimy, who says she has not only treated
L.A. clients, but their relatives visiting from England, Italy and
Australia. "I sometimes think the entire planet has a problem with
it."</TE>
<TE>   The infestations seem more prevalent in the fall, probably because
that is the first of the schools' routine head checks of students
after the long summer months, when an infestation can get out of
control. Anyone can get head lice, but children are more susceptible
because they play closely together, providing the opportunity for
hair-to-hair contact, which can spread the bugs.</TE>
<TE>   Adaimy has tapped into a growing niche in the service industry. An
estimated 12 million Americans get head lice each year, and experts
say the lice are becoming more and more immune to over-the-counter
and prescription shampoos. As a result, the business of nit-picking
is on the rise. There are a handful of similar lice salons or clinics
in the nation.</TE>
<TE>   "[My service] is a luxury," Adaimy says. "But even the most
diligent parent can spend three months with the problem, and I can
rid them of it in two weeks. It takes a trained eye."</TE>
<TE>   Adaimy started Hair Fairies--originally as a house-call
business--about 21/2 years ago after reading about the need in the
Wall Street Journal. She spent three weeks learning about lice at
doctors' offices and scouring medical journals and Web sites.</TE>
<TE>   Since then her business has grown from 10 to 50 clients a week
coming from the San Fernando Valley, Manhattan Beach and all cities
in between. She also has student nurses from USC on call to nit-pick
in a pinch.</TE>
<TE>   Adaimy hopes that soon she will have five professional nit-pickers
seeing clients on the hour--every hour from 8 a.m. to 7 p.m.--seven
days a week.</TE>
<TE>   "She should franchise," says one Westwood mother of two elementary
school-age daughters who were infested with thousands of nits. "Hair
Fairies is a mother's dream. I don't think I could manage this
myself. I would have been nit-picking day and night."</TE>
<TE>   But while parents are singing Adaimy's praises, some public health
officials are skeptical. Professional nit-picking, which can add up
to hundreds of dollars, can be financially out of reach for most
families, they say. Others worry that professional nit-pickers should
be trained medically to be able to identify other problems of the
scalp. And still others feel that the art of nit-picking shouldn't be
lost by parents.</TE>
<TE>   "It's important that families know how to take care of some of
these types of things on their own," says Karen Maiorca, director of
nursing services for Los Angeles Unified School District. "Families
... should be able to treat their own children."</TE>
<TE>   But it's the overloaded and overworked parent that Adaimy believes
will welcome her professional services, especially if she can get
treatments covered by insurance.</TE>
<TE>   "[Then] I can service all of Los Angeles," she says, which can be
important for an operation that banks on not having too much repeat
business.</TE>
<TE>   "Hopefully, we won't have to see you again," says one happy mother
leaving the shop with her now lice-free 2-year-old daughter.</TE>

<LD>Happy New Year! Have you made a New Year's resolution? Perhaps you
want success in 2002. When people in India and elsewhere in Southeast
Asia want to overcome obstacles and get ahead, they ask the Hindu god
Ganesha for assistance.</LD>
<LD>   Is there anything unusual about this sculpture of Ganesha? You
might wonder why he has an animal head and a human body. In one myth,
Ganesha angers his father, Shiva, who then takes off his son's head.
Enraged by this action, Ganesha's mother insists that a replacement
head be taken from the first living being that comes along. What
animal provided a head for Ganesha's body? If you guessed an
elephant, you are right!</LD>
<LD>   Although it is easy to recognize Ganesha by his elephant head and
broken tusk, there are also other special objects associated with
him. Often we find Ganesha carrying a battle-ax, a radish, even a
bowl of sweets. Do you think Ganesha loves to eat? Here, Ganesha is
holding his two wives, Riddhi and Buddhi, who represent prosperity
and intelligence. When Ganesha travels from place to place, he
doesn't ride a car. Instead, he rides a rat. Look carefully, and you
can find it at the base of the sculpture.</LD>
<TE>   You can meet Ganesha at the Norton Simon Museum. Be sure to pick
up your free family guide to the Indian and Southeast Asian
collection. It will help you learn even more about other cultures and
discover other fascinating gods and goddesses. The museum is open
every day except Tuesday. For more information, call (626) 449-6840
or visit www.nortonsimon.org.</TE>

<HD>Teach Your Children Well--With Movies</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NITA LELYVELD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Somewhere around 1 a.m. each morning, when his wife and kids are
asleep, Jim Frieden tiptoes from his bed to his computer, where he
types away for hours. By day, he's a litigator with a solo practice.
But by night, he's insomniac and film critic, filling a Web site with
his thoughts on movies from "Gone With the Wind" to "Gattaca."</LD>
<LD>   On a recent afternoon, in the Friedens' cozy Pacific Palisades
living room, where a comfy leather couch sits right beside a big TV,
15-year-old Alex rolled his eyes knowingly.</LD>
<LD>   His dad, he says, is going through "his midlife crisis."</LD>
<TE>   In fact, it was Alex's response to movies as a child that more or
less inspired teachwithmovies.org, a Web site started by Frieden and
his wife, Debbie Elliott.</TE>
<TE>   The Teach With Movies site gives parents and teachers a guide to
films that are entertaining and thought-provoking for kids.</TE>
<TE>   "Debbie and I used to just wander around Blockbuster and be unable
to find the right movie at the right time for our kids," said
Frieden, 53. "Then three months later, we'd think of it. You think of
a movie you'd like to show them, and it's hard. You're trying to
remember what's in it, if there's anything too intense. That's where
we help."</TE>
<TE>   The Web site does not review every new movie that comes out.
Instead, it specifically recommends about 200 films that the Friedens
believe have special value. They include the highbrow ("Europa!
Europa!," "La Traviata") and the not-so-highbrow ("Cool Runnings,"
"Antz"), along with minimum-age recommendations, themes that the
films address, possible problems (such as swearing or violence) and
questions to get kids talking about what they've just seen. There are
suggestions aimed at teachers, and others aimed at parents. A click
on a topic such as suicide yields specific movie suggestions ("Lust
for Life," "Romeo and Juliet," "Courage Under Fire"). And lest anyone
think the couple is in favor of educating by movies alone, many of
the movie descriptions also list relevant books for adults and
children.</TE>
<TE>   The Frieden family realized the power of movies as a teaching and
talking tool after Alex saw the movie "Gandhi" when he was 9 years
old. In his fourth-grade class, he was learning about the Rev. Martin
Luther King Jr. Mahatma Gandhi, his parents explained, had been one
of King's central influences.</TE>
<TE>   Wide-eyed, Alex asked to see the movie again and again, Frieden
said.</TE>
<TE>   "And each time he would come back with questions. He got so
interested. It was such an educational experience for him. It
exploded things for him."</TE>
<TE>   Hearing this account, teenage Alex looks at his father and gives
an oh-brother sort of shrug. Still, he says he remembers the movie's
powerful images--of protesters engaged in acts of civil disobedi-
ence being shot at by police. "I don't see things like that living
here in the Palisades," he says. "It was a different way of looking
at things."</TE>
<TE>   Sitting next to him on the couch, Frieden nods his head. "You see,
that's important," he says. "We need to be able to say to kids,
'These things happen.'"</TE>
<TE>   Talking about big issues comes naturally in this house, where
everyone is articulated and opinionated and ready with arguments. All
the movie watching has helped, Frieden says.</TE>
<TE>   "Gandhi" was just the beginning. Soon the Friedens were pondering
the Cold War through "Dr. Strangelove." And when watching "Strictly
Ballroom" inspired  Alex and his younger brother Justin, 10, to take
up dancing, their parents knew they were onto something.</TE>
<TE>   "We probably watched it 10 times, and then Alex said, 'I think I
can do that. I think I can do flamenco,'" says Elliott, a former
dancer.</TE>
<TE>   Three years ago, when Frieden and Elliott launched the Web site,
the idea was to reach out to other parents. But teachers and film
buffs now also frequent the site, as do librarians and
home-schoolers. They come from all over the world.</TE>
<TE>   Recently, a teacher from Ohio asked them to include "The Patriot."
A visitor from the Jewish studies program at Tulane University said
he'd read the study guide on "Hester Street" and had some suggestions
for fine-tuning the questions. A Christian motivational speaker from
London asked for suggestions of movies that discuss adultery.</TE>
<TE>   The most recent tracking numbers show the Web site's pages being
visited 170,000 times in a month.</TE>
<TE>   What makes it stand out, visitors say, is its detail.</TE>
<TE>   Peggy Hamilton, a retired engineer from Richland, Wash., stumbled
across the site recently, when she was looking for movies to show her
daughter Rachel, 8, before a family trip to India. She wanted to know
whether "A Passage to India" would be appropriate, and the site
answered that question and more, she says. "It was bang on. It gave
me everything I needed to know," Hamilton said.</TE>
<TE>   "It had a lot of historical information that I could share with
her ahead of time," she says. "It sure helps if you know something
about a movie before you see it with your child. And I get tired of
previewing everything. You only have so much time."</TE>
<TE>   Frieden and Elliot say they've tried to make their site useful to
as broad an audience as possible. They're amused by the fact that, as
lapsed Unitarians themselves, they have created a site that appeals
just as much to the Christian right as to liberal parents and
teachers.</TE>
<TE>   To keep the audience broad, they're strict about what they
recommend, and they approach each movie from different angles.</TE>
<TE>   In the section on "Billy Elliot," the story of a boy from an
English mining family who falls in love with ballet, for instance,
the site lists key themes, including families in crisis, grieving,
father-son issues and courage. The movie, the site says, "shows
children the rewards of perseverance in following their dreams and
not giving up in the face of popular opinion." It also mentions
problems that some parents might have with the film: the amount of
swearing and smoking, and the fact that Billy's best friend dresses
up in women's clothing and is becoming aware of his homosexuality.</TE>
<TE>   "The film accepts Michael's homosexuality without any negative
implication. Some parents may object to anything other than a
negative portrayal of homosexuality," the guide states. "However,
Billy, who is heterosexual, is able to set boundaries to his
relationship with Michael and thereby maintain their friendship. In
this way, the film provides an excellent model for the maintenance of
friendships between people who are substantially different."</TE>
<TE>   Recently, to reach more people, Teach With Movies linked up with
Character Counts, a nonpartisan, nonsectarian program from the
Josephson Institute of Ethics in Marina del Rey. Each discussion
guide now includes basic questions about ethics.</TE>
<TE>   The Web site is a labor of love, Frieden says. He makes no money
from it. Small ads that flash on the home page only defray the costs
of running the site.</TE>
<TE>   Keeping the site current is a family affair. But these days the
kids sometimes have to be talked into watching yet another movie
chosen by their parents. This is a family that can argue, and every
movie sparks back-and-forth debate. Frieden and Elliott hash out
their thoughts. Increasingly, Alex and Justin also contribute their
criticism.</TE>
<TE>   The Web site list, with its aim for broad appeal, is, in fact, far
more limited than their own viewing at home. And the boys' taste in
movies often strays from the educational.</TE>
<TE>   Justin, for instance, loves "Legally Blonde" and "The Matrix."
Alex is a fan of "Wonder Boys" and "White Man's Burden," two movies
his parents put on the site's list of "Films Not Recommended as
Teaching Tools."</TE>
<TE>   Alex is still upset about "White Man's Burden," a role-reversal
movie in which John Travolta plays a working-class white man in a
world where whites are in the minority. In the Friedens' living room,
talk of the movie quickly turns into a friendly but rollicking
debate.</TE>
<TE>   "All I remember is that you disqualified it on the basis of
'gratuitous violence,'" Alex says, stressing the phrase
sarcastically. "He uses those words so much!"</TE>
<TE>   "There is a lot of violence," says Frieden.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think it's gratuitous at all. I disagree. Absolutely, it
should be on the list," says Elliott.</TE>
<TE>   Wedged between his wife and son on the couch, Frieden shrugs his
shoulders sheepishly. "Well, we're going to reconsider it.
Everything's subject to reconsideration. It's a learning process," he
says.</TE>
<TE>   Each night, with the talk still percolating in his head and the
rest of the family asleep, Frieden sits at the computer and writes
about what he's learned.</TE>

<HD>For This Firm, Overexposure Is a Good Thing</HD>
<DH>Live Acts Video takes care of details so others can act out
their fantasies.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>REED JOHNSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Gothic Bedroom, with its stained-glass windows and handmade birch
bed, exudes a spooky, Anne Rice sort of charm. The gleaming, sterile
Doctor's Office could be mistaken for the real thing. And the Dungeon
is a baroque dreamscape of perverse pleasures, where participants can
channel their inner Marquis de Sade and the whips and dog collars are
compliments of the house.</LD>
<LD>   But if Frank Keshishian had to pick one room that he thinks best
exemplifies the craftsmanship and TLC he put into Live Acts Video,
his unconventional new Beverly Hills business, it would definitely be
the Barn, a rustic assemblage of straw bales, farming equipment and
nostalgic Americana.</LD>
<LD>   In fact, whatever your hidden romantic inclinations, Live Acts is
eager to supply the sets, props and recording equipment. All you need
bring are your partner and your libido. In exchange, you'll take home
a lightened wallet and a videocassette or DVD of yourself appearing
in what once were quaintly known as "compromising positions."</LD>
<TE>   So far it's been an eye-opening experience even for Live Acts'
owner. "I'd never been in this business before, but you catch on very
quickly," says Keshishian, 44, a former Beverly Hills residential
designer who soon may be regarded either as the Westside's biggest
professional laughingstock or, conversely, as the most ingenious
promoter of sexual adventurism since Masters and Johnson.</TE>
<TE>   The outcome largely depends on whether Los Angeles, the world's
alternative-lifestyle capital, embraces his unusual new enterprise or
treats it as just the latest passing fling.</TE>
<TE>   Billed by its owner as the first such business of its kind
anywhere, Live Acts Video (www. liveactsvideo.com) represents the
newest twist in high-tech-assisted sensual gratification. At prices
ranging from $330 to $575, the Beverly Hills company offers couples
and other interested parties the chance to preserve their most
intimate moments on videotape or DVD, with the kind of production
values you'd expect to find in the Dream Factory's backyard.</TE>
<TE>   Lodged in a two-story beige office building a few blocks west of
the Beverly Center, Live Acts seeks to project a sophisticated,
high-end image. Original artworks dot its buffed and polished
interior. Skylights and a gurgling indoor fountain create the
soothing ambience of a corporate inner sanctum. Patrons may park in
the rear of the building and exit through a back door, away from
prying eyes.</TE>
<TE>   Once inside, clients choose among the four themed rooms,
meticulously appointed enough to pass muster on a Hollywood back lot.
Costumes, props, background music and even rudimentary "scripts" also
are provided for the imaginatively challenged. Where his visitors
take it from there, the owner says, is pretty much up to them.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not just about having sex," Keshishian insists. "There's a
lot of role-playing, there's a lot of scenarios. When they're acting,
I find that our clientele is much more aroused than they would be in
a regular situation. They do have a better time, and they do have
better sex. It's a total escape from their reality. It's allowing
them to be someone they normally aren't."</TE>
<TE>   Most sessions last about an hour, "plus a little bit," Keshishian
says, after which full showering facilities are available and the set
is scrubbed down with an anti-bacterial disinfectant and made ready
for the next customer. "It's never under [an hour]. If it is, they're
doing something wrong," says Keshishian, a humorous, soft-spoken man
who looks as if he hasn't gotten enough sleep lately. "I'm so busy
right now," he says. "I have no life."</TE>
<TE>   Besides the four permanent sets, Keshishian plans to add a
flexible fifth space that can be transformed in a jiffy into an
office, locker room, clothing store changing room ("Say, how do those
pants fit? Oh, excuse me, sir!") or whatever other fantasy interior
the client fancies. Keshishian says the business operates in line
with city ordinances governing adult-related establishments.</TE>
<TE>   Each set is enclosed within a double-doored, fully sound-proofed
room, armed with strategically placed microphones and three cameras,
each with 360-degree rotation. Outside, a box lights up to indicate
when recording is in progress. "There's something exciting about
movies," Keshishian enthuses. "The average couple's like, 'We're on a
movie set!'"</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   A Range  of Packages</TE>
<TE>   Of course, not all couples are average, at least when it comes to
the size of their wallets. Accordingly, Live Acts offers three
pricing packages that let customers decide not only how much to spend
but how much seclusion they want. The Silver package, the least
expensive, lets them record their session in complete privacy using
concealed, hand-operated remote controls.</TE>
<TE>   With the Gold package, a professional technician seated in a
separate control room guides three cameras and selects zoom shots.
The Platinum package provides a professional videographer "in the
same room filming scenes as close as the client likes," according to
the promotional literature.</TE>
<TE>   The company's in-house video-grapher, known as Bishop, considers
it simply part of his job to help coach people through the process,
if they go with the Platinum option. "I tell them, 'Don't look at the
camera. Keep your hands busy, never lay them on your side. Be
verbal,'" says Bishop, an affable former adult-film industry
cameraman. "I tell people, 'Enjoy yourselves.' When they're having
fun, you can tell. And most people are having fun."</TE>
<TE>   For some clients, being watched in flagrante by a stranger with a
camera simply adds to the erotic frisson, Keshishian says. "That's
our main goal, is to make clients comfortable here. Everybody has
different personalities, different tastes, different comfort levels."</TE>
<TE>   Which raises the most ticklish issue facing Live Acts. From an
extensive marketing survey conducted before opening, Keshishian found
that most customers' greatest fear was that their private cavortings
might somehow wind up being published in a magazine or posted on the
Internet.</TE>
<TE>   To assuage those doubts, Live Acts issues each client a written
privacy guarantee that only one videotape or DVD copy of the session
will be produced and given immediately to them. Live Acts also
promises not to release or sell any personal information about
individual customers. "We're here to stay in business," Keshishian
says. "We don't play games with extra copies. It'd be a nightmare
with liabilities."</TE>
<TE>   Every room is equipped with a 27-inch TV monitor so that
participants can follow the on-screen activity if they wish. But the
screens, which are directly wired to the video and DVD recorders
where the tapes are made, also are meant to reassure customers that
what they see is, in fact, what they get, and no funny stuff is going
on behind the scenes.</TE>
<TE>   To further ensure confidentiality, Live Acts doesn't edit tapes or
perform any other post-production work. If clients record in DVD,
Keshishian says, they can do their own editing on their home
computers. Only the videographer ever sees the recordings, Keshishian
says; he never does.</TE>
<TE>   Whether it's Internet chat rooms, computer dating services, phone
sex or his own business, Keshishian maintains that what makes
customers apprehensive isn't technology per se but the possibility of
its abuse and misuse. Remove that risk, he believes, and the world
will beat a path to your door.</TE>
<TE>   Divorced, with a 23-year-old daughter, Keshishian says his family
and friends have been very supportive of his latest venture. Since
opening in mid-October, Live Acts has catered to about 50 couples and
other assorted groupings. Besides attracting dozens of visitors
through its appointment-only guided tours, the company has drawn
additional scores of novelty seekers with its monthly open houses
(which Keshishian says he plans to discontinue because they're "too
impersonal"). So far, he's limited his advertising to the city's
alternative weeklies but may look for additional outlets.</TE>
<TE>   "We have had some celebrity activity here," Keshishian says
cryptically, quickly adding that he can't disclose any more because
of the company's confidentiality agreement.</TE>
<TE>   Two non-celebrity customers, Ben and Sonya, a Westside
professional couple in their 40s who asked that their real names not
be used in this story, said they couldn't have been happier with
their Live Acts experience--though Sonya admits she initially was
"very reluctant" when her husband brought home a newspaper ad. "But
then we got there, and it just kind of happened," she says.</TE>
<TE>   Sonya says she especially appreciated Keshishian's low-key manner
and professional eye for design. "I was really stunned about the
quality of the place, the beauty of the place," she says. "They also
made you really feel not nervous."</TE>
<TE>   A number of local adult filmmakers and producers also have dropped
by Live Acts to check out the decor, which Keshishian boasts is far
superior to a typical adult movie set. Though he has rented out his
studios for porno shoots, Keshishian says he's now "kind of staying
away from that."</TE>
<TE>   "This is really geared more toward the general public. Our rates
are too high for them [adult filmmakers]. They'll want to pay you
$500 for a whole day and a whole crew. I don't think so!"</TE>
<TE>   At first glance, Keshishian seems an unlikely candidate to operate
an X-rated video salon. Brooklyn-born and Burbank-bred, he studied
design at UCLA, sold real estate for a few years and at 27 opened a
residential remodeling business, L.A. Design Concepts in the
mid-1980s. The business apparently did well, attracting Hollywood
screenwriters and wealthy Westsiders. Keshishian was mentioned
extensively in a September 1988 story on interior design in the Los
Angeles Times Magazine.</TE>
<TE>   He also attracted controversy several years ago when he came up
with the idea of using his professional credentials to enable his
clients to purchase goods from the Pacific Design Center, the West
Hollywood wholesale shopping mall of home furnishings. At the time,
the facility was only open to architects, designers and other members
of the trade, not the general public. Keshishian or a member of his
staff would escort the client on these shopping trips, effectively
serving as a middleman.</TE>
<TE>   "The Design Center was cool with it, but the designers in the
community were livid they didn't think of it," Keshishian says.</TE>
<TE>   Extending his business philosophy to sex, Keshishian seems intent
on making an indulgence that was formerly reserved for elites readily
available to the middle-class masses. Seeking to capitalize on
America's growing appetite for recording the minutiae of its daily
existence, Live Acts synthesizes three current national compulsions:
sex, self-display and "reality based" entertainment. It could become
the do-it-yourself version of "Temptation Island," but with fewer
commercials and slightly less inane dialogue.</TE>
<TE>   Though he says he doesn't feel at all embarrassed about his new
career, occasionally Keshishian gives a different impression. Asked
if he would use such a service himself, he unhesitatingly answers,
"Oh, absolutely." Asked if he actually has, he hesitates. "Have I?"
he repeats. "Do I have to admit to it?"</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   An Obsession With the Details</TE>
<TE>   While sex generally sells itself, Keshishian is banking on the
allure of his themed rooms, which were conceived and built with an
attention to detail bordering on obsessiveness, as if Martha Stewart
and Larry Flynt had decided to open a boutique motel. Like much else
about his business, Keshishian says the themes were selected partly
based on his survey results.</TE>
<TE>   To implement his vision, Keshishian hired Design Setters Corp., a
well-regarded Burbank outfit that has created sets and special
effects for movies, music videos and theme park attractions.
Keshishian then sweated out dozens of details about how each room
should look.</TE>
<TE>   He regards the Barn as his masterpiece and enjoys pointing out its
features to visitors: a weathered RC Cola crate, a saddle, a wagon
wheel specially treated to look aged and rusted. At one end of the
wooden enclosure, a ladder points to a loft suggestively strewn with
blankets.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not like some kind of cheesy background," Keshishian says.
"They don't even do this for movies, this kind of quality. We have
every square inch finished off in every room. You'd swear you're in a
barn, but you're right here in the middle of Beverly Hills."</TE>
<TE>   Rick Tinsley, Design Setters' senior vice president of production,
said his work with Live Acts was "probably one of the strangest
requests" he's ever gotten. "My first feeling was, this has got to be
illegal, you know?" Tinsley says. "But then I thought about it, and
sex sells. If he does it right and keeps it clean and professional, I
think it's definitely something that will spread throughout the
cities."</TE>
<TE>   Asked if he'd consider using the service himself, Tinsley utters a
loud laugh. "I keep on saying yes and no," he replies. "If no one
knew, if it was top secret, I think I would. You just worry about
who's in the other booth."</TE>
<TE>   But if the increasing mainstreaming of pornography suggests that
more people are willing to regard sex as a kind of
performance--something "enacted" rather than "expressed," in the
words of British film critic Richard Dyer--those remaining
inhibitions may fall away, and Keshishian could have a hit.</TE>
<TE>   "I think there's an actor in all of us," says Tinsley. "It's just
getting over the initial uncomfortableness of it. It's just like
those people on TV, 'Survivor.' After a while they don't realize the
camera is there. They just go on."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   An Open House Attracts the Curious</TE>
<TE>   On a cold, rainy night a few days before Christmas, several dozen
prospective "actors"--married couples, straight and gay lovers, the
enthusiastic and the fashionably faded--gather at a Live Acts open
house to meet the proprietor and inspect the merchandise. An erotic
slide show illuminates a wall, while a DJ pumps out trip-hop and
electronica.</TE>
<TE>   Among the browsers is Gene Jenkins, 37, a security guard who works
in the neighborhood. "I was thinking about coming here with my
girlfriend and doing a bondage scene," he says. "I was thinking about
going with a Platinum package. I have a VHS at home, but I don't have
the elaborate, exotic sets. They look very classy."</TE>
<TE>   A few feet away, in the Gothic Bedroom, Jack, a casting director
who asked that his name be changed, says the business was "great for
L.A. L.A.'s all about fantasy, so it combines sexuality and fantasy
all in one. I happen to have a great sex life, so I don't need this,"
he adds. But "I guess it's like Disneyland for adults."</TE>
<TE>   Jack's friend, Nigel, a professional photographer from England, is
more skeptical. He reckons he could make customers a better offer
himself. "I'll do it for $200--cash," he says.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, on a balcony overlooking the lobby, Keshishian is
fielding queries from two young men. One, with slightly glassy eyes
and a crooked smirk, does most of the talking. "We wanted to know,
when you pay for your hour, do you have to stay in the same room, or
can you go to other rooms?" he asks. You have to stay in the same
room, Keshishian answers.</TE>
<TE>   "And is it the same charge however many people you have in the
room?"</TE>
<TE>   How many people were you thinking of, Keshishian responds.</TE>
<TE>   "Ten," the man replies, grinning.</TE>
<TE>   Keshishian hedges. Probably there'd be a little extra charge, he
says, depending on the amount of wear and tear on the set.</TE>
<TE>   Apparently satisfied, the two men move on. Lowering his voice,
Keshishian says he generally can anticipate such questions from the
results of his marketing surveys. But he concedes that "your
marketing strategy is just constantly being evaluated, because there
is no manual to this."</TE>
<TE>   Even so, Keshishian is confident that the numbers are there to
support his vision. The numbers, the machines and the human desire.
"I guess our market is anybody that's having sex," he says. "Not
quite, but you know what I mean."</TE>

<HD>Drawn to the Front</HD>
<DH>As a reporter for radio and the Village Voice, cartoonist
Ted Rall  saw an Afghanistan where danger and despair are one's
nearest neighbors.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BETTIJANE LEVINE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Ted Rall, war reporter, is just back from the Afghan front--a place
as nonexistent as his reporting credentials, he says. "Anywhere in
Afghanistan is arguably the front. It's any bend in the road, it
constantly changes, it could easily be called The Side or The Back."</LD>
<LD>   Rall has never covered a war before, nor has he ever worked as a
reporter. Most days, he's an award-winning political cartoonist,
author and a world-class cynic--the kind of guy who likes to marinate
in a warm bath, then draw his corrosive cartoon characters from an
easel at home in his slippers.</LD>
<LD>   With no experience and no actual battle lines to cover, Rall
considered himself ideal for the Afghanistan correspondent job. How
bad could it be? He's had a passion for Central Asia since childhood,
when he read about it in National Geographic. And wouldn't it be
great to see Afghanistan on "somebody else's nickel?"</LD>
<TE>   It wasn't hard for him to get an assignment. "There apparently
aren't a lot of American journalists dying to go to Afghanistan," he
says. And he does have two Robert F. Kennedy awards (1995 and 2000),
and a Pulitzer Prize finalist's title to wave as credentials. In any
event, two local radio stations (KFI-AM and KLAC-AM) and one
newspaper (the Village Voice in Manhattan) hired the 38-year-old
curmudgeon to take the trip and send back stirring communiques.</TE>
<TE>   He enlisted his wife, Judy Chang, 37, to take pictures, since her
dot-com job had recently ended. On Nov. 16, the pair flew to
Tajikistan and immediately joined a convoy of 45 real reporters, who
were traveling to the Afghanistan border.</TE>
<TE>   Rall believed he was a step ahead of his colleagues,  because most
of them had never been to that part of the planet. He, on the other
hand, had traveled there extensively, and even led a quirky five-week
tour for 24 people in 2000 to countries whose names end in "stan."
(Tajikistan, Turkhmenistan, Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan, Kyrigyzstan.)
They couldn't enter Afghanistan because "there was fighting, as
usual." Rall charged no fee for his services. He did it out of his
love for the area and his interest in "random human experimentation."</TE>
<TE>   From that experience, he says, "I knew some pitfalls we might
encounter in Afghanistan. But even I was astonished by the insanity
of the conditions we found there."</TE>
<TE>   The first thing he realized is that "things are even worse than
they are portrayed in the media. We're talking about a country that
uses treads from ancient Soviet tanks as speed bumps in the few
existing roads. A place in which all housing and other buildings in
village after village has been totally flattened, erased, by bombs. A
place where people talk only in past tense.</TE>
<TE>   "They'll say, 'I had a great friend, but he died. I had a good
father, but he was killed. There was a town here, but it's gone. A
museum there, but it was bombed.' Afghanistan is all about what was,
not what is. Because there is nothing now. It's like driving through
a ghost town in Nevada, except it's almost the whole country," Rall
says.</TE>
<TE>   To get from the border to the town of Taloqan, about 20 kilometers
into Afghanistan, the reporters had to negotiate for their own
transportation. There were plenty of rides available, Rall says,
because Afghanistan "has an even more developed car culture than Los
Angeles. There are SUVs, Jeeps, leftover Soviet trucks. Osama [bin
Laden] bought loyalty by giving these vehicles to his followers." But
there was a hitch. "For a 20-kilometer ride, the Afghans wanted
$1,400 per person," Rall says, still sounding amazed. The appropriate
fee would have been about $1, he adds.</TE>
<TE>   Right away, he says, he noticed "a kind of civil war between TV
and print media." "The big TV guys, like the BBC and CNN, came with
pockets bursting with cash. They paid the most exorbitant amounts for
even the smallest service."</TE>
<TE>   Some paid the asking price for the ride to Taloqan, he says. Most
bargained and paid between $400 and $800. Rall was in despair. He and
his wife only had $7,000 for the entire trip, he says, and at that
rate his money would be gone before he had done his work. "I was like
a kid waiting for a kickball. I waited and waited. Finally, when all
the others had left, we got someone to take us for $20 each."</TE>
<TE>   Of course, he got there before the others, because the drivers
took the big spenders in a huge, unnecessary circle in order to
justify the immense fees they had been paid.</TE>
<TE>   The press contingent ended up in the relatively intact town of
Taloqan because the siege of Kunduz was taking place not far away.
"Kunduz is at the crossroads of the only two major paved roads in
Afghanistan. We had to wait for Kunduz to fall so we could travel
past it. If we tried to get around it on the few atrocious unpaved
roads, there was certainty of being robbed and killed," he says.</TE>
<TE>   Everyone checked in at the town's tiny Foreign Ministry, where
they were assigned to stay in different houses, according to what
they could pay. Rall says the BBC and CNN people stayed in "the only
house with a real toilet and electricity. It belonged to a Northern
Alliance commander."</TE>
<TE>   The Ralls, two Washington Post reporters and three from Portuguese
radio and TV, stayed in a house with no furniture, electricity, heat,
water or toilet--"only a hole in the ground outside near the family
rooster." Others, mostly from the foreign press, stayed in similar
houses nearby. For this, each paid a minimum of $25 per night, he
says.</TE>
<TE>   Each media group was assigned by the ministry to a translator and
a driver for a fee of $120 per person per day.</TE>
<TE>   "The first morning we said, 'Take us to the front.' Off we went,
zipping down the highway, the wind blowing through our hair. It's
very surreal. You're in this late-model car, you're listening to
Indian movie music, you're charging your satellite phone on the
cigarette lighter--and all the while you are passing refugees from
the siege of Kunduz, fleeing the other way. You're also passing slow
convoys of tanks and armored personnel trucks, all going the same
place you are. And overhead, F-16s are circling lazily, trying to
draw out enemy fire. You don't really know if you will come back dead
or alive."</TE>
<TE>   The front was very weird, he says. It was a bend in the road,
which looked like a parking lot--filled with people who'd driven
their cars there to get away from the shelling. "This is a war
without real battles. Typically what happens in a place like Kunduz
is that the Northern Alliance surrounds the town, then the Americans
drop bombs to clear out the Taliban so the Alliance can go in and
take their place."</TE>
<TE>   Typically, he says, the Taliban got tired of being bombed. So its
members would come out in abject surrender and physically embrace
their rivals. "After this, they literally run to the nearest place
where they can get their beards shaved off and buy those hats that
the Northern Alliance wear. They ditch their turbans ... get a shave,
and the next day they are Northern Alliance troops. So when we say
we've won, you have to understand that many of today's Alliance
troops are yesterday's Taliban. This is a fashion war," he says.
"They could change hats again tomorrow--and they probably will."</TE>
<TE>   Rall and his wife had been "hanging out" in the war zone for a
couple of hours, watching relatively little happen, when he "got a
bad feeling that something awful was about to occur." He yielded to
his impulse to leave, and shortly afterward "the parking lot" was
shelled by the Taliban, and most people in it were injured or killed.</TE>
<TE>   In the few days Rall and his wife were in Taloqan, three members
of the press in his original 45-person convoy were killed.</TE>
<TE>   A reporter who was interviewing Taliban prisoners was set upon by
the prisoners, and Rall says that eyewitnesses with whom he spoke
said the man was "torn apart." Northern Alliance soldiers nearby
either could not or did not protect the reporter, Rall says.</TE>
<TE>   A cameraman in their group was killed by Taliban shelling. Another
cameraman, a 42-year-old Swede staying down the street from the
Ralls, was murdered in the middle of the night. "Three soldiers came
knocking on all the doors. We heard them and didn't answer. Others
heard and didn't answer. The only one who answered was the Swedish
guy. They killed him and took his money. They were going to kill the
other five press members in the house, but a translator who was
sleeping there prevailed upon them to have mercy. He told them, 'It's
Ramadan. You shouldn't kill them if you are Muslim. They have
families and children.'"</TE>
<TE>   Although the official number of journalists killed is eight, Rall
believes many more deaths may have occurred. And he has noticed other
oddities in reportage, he says. "Prior to our arrival, a French
journalist was killed. I confirmed with eyewitnesses that she was
gang raped, horrifically mutilated, her body found nude. Yet all the
reports said only that she had been shot. No details of what
happened. I get the impression that nobody is really interested in
the death of journalists in Afghanistan." (According to news reports,
a French radio reporter named Johanne Sutton was killed in
Afghanistan on Nov. 11.)</TE>
<TE>   After the Swedish cameraman's death, remaining members of the
convoy realized they had to leave town. "Let's face it. These guys
knew we had money. They had driven us to this place. They knew
exactly where we lived. We wouldn't survive them if we stayed."</TE>
<TE>   Some went on to Kabul, but not the Ralls. "It would have cost
$3,300 for each of us to hire transportation. If we spent it to go
there, we wouldn't have enough to get back." More important, Rall
says, the difficult conditions were getting to many of the more
seasoned journalists, and certainly to his wife and him.</TE>
<TE>   "War you can live with. But when you are being hunted down like
prey for the money you carry, when you are in a country where every
man over 13 carries an AK-47 and wants to point it at you, when
almost every breath you take is filled with toxic dust--Afghan dust
is the consistency of flour, and even a dog walking on a road causes
a cloud to rise so that you must breathe it," he says.</TE>
<TE>   To make matters worse, the country's brutal drought means there is
no water; certainly none that is clean.</TE>
<TE>   Rall came home on Dec. 16, having filed reports for the Voice
(where his political cartoons are a weekly feature) and daily radio
reports by satellite phone. Doug Simmons, managing editor of the
Voice, calls Rall's war reports "well-reported, insightful and
intensely contrarian. One story, for example, was headlined 'How We
Lost the War.' As far as I know, his story was the only expression of
such a sentiment and argument that's appeared in the press."  Rall is
writing a book on what he calls his "12th century experience" in
Afghanistan. It will not be a pretty tale.</TE>
<TE>   "I have reached a level of cynicism even I would never have
thought possible," he says.</TE>
<TE>   Bombing and destruction have been "over the top," he says. The
country has no infrastructure--no paved roads, running water,
electricity. He'd like to see guns confiscated from the
populace--"but you'd have to kick down every door. They have a
guns-and-heroin culture there now."</TE>
<TE>   Rall says average citizens are extremely hard-working and loyal.
"Even in the midst of all this, it is amazing to see them plowing the
dry ground, trying to graze animals in what appears to be dirt.
Somehow, they are growing pomegranates and managing to save a few
scrawny sheep. Imagine what a fabulous country they could build if
they had a few decades of peace."</TE>

<LD>My name is Emily.</LD>
<LD>   These are the things I really, really like:</LD>
<LD>   * My cat, Pudder.</LD>
<TE>   * Books.</TE>
<TE>   * Chocolate.</TE>
<TE>   * Writing.</TE>
<TE>   * Making crafts.</TE>
<TE>   * Books.</TE>
<TE>   * My best friend, Callie.</TE>
<TE>   * Anything yellow.</TE>
<TE>   * My toes.</TE>
<TE>   * Books. (I really love books!)</TE>
<TE>   * Cinnamon toast.</TE>
<TE>   I kinda like:</TE>
<TE>   * Carrots.</TE>
<TE>   * School.</TE>
<TE>   * My little brother.</TE>
<TE>   I don't like:</TE>
<TE>   * Oatmeal (yuck).</TE>
<TE>   * Multiplication tables.</TE>
<TE>   * The word "can't."</TE>
<TE>   I'm pretty much like other kids my age, except for one thing.</TE>
<TE>   My heart doesn't work the way other kids' hearts work.</TE>
<TE>   Don't get me wrong. I have a good heart. I mean, I try to be nice
to my little brother, and I say thank you and please, and I always
try to do the right thing, but it is still a "bad" heart because it
doesn't let me do the things I really want to do. It simply doesn't
work right.</TE>
<TE>   You see, most of all, I want to be like everyone else. I want to:</TE>
<TE>   * Take ballet lessons.</TE>
<TE>   * Ride a bike.</TE>
<TE>   * Be a cheerleader.</TE>
<TE>   * Play soccer.</TE>
<TE>   * Run.</TE>
<TE>   But I don't do these things because I get too tired. What I can do
is:</TE>
<TE>   * Read.</TE>
<TE>   * Paint.</TE>
<TE>   * Write.</TE>
<TE>   * Cross-stitch.</TE>
<TE>   My best friend is Callie. Callie comes to my house because she
says I always have fun things to do--especially on rainy days.</TE>
<TE>   We can sit for hours making friendship bracelets. But the day we
started making memory books, I got really sad, which is pretty
unusual for me.</TE>
<TE>   There were all these pictures of Callie with Lindsey on a hike.
And Callie with Jennifer at the beach. And Callie with Elizabeth at
camp.</TE>
<TE>   But there were no pictures of me with Callie.</TE>
<TE>   Maybe she thought the stuff we did wasn't very fun after all.</TE>
<TE>   So I asked Callie why there weren't any pictures of us doing stuff
and she said, "Well, Emily, you know you can't do exciting things. We
do quiet things."</TE>
<TE>   I think the word "can't" is the worst word in the English
language!</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Tuesday: Emily has a plan.</TE>
<TE>   Cherie Troped doesn't like the word "can't" either! This story

<HD>When a Kid Wants to Toot His Own Horn, What's Mom to Do?</HD>
<DH>Her 12-year-old decides to perform on the street, with his
trumpet--and her--in tow.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BERNADETTE MURPHY</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It had been a grueling few weeks. My 12-year-old son, Jarrod, an
aspiring jazz trumpeter, was running the middle-school version of a
musical gantlet. He'd been preparing for two concerts and an audition
for the Southern California Honor Band. There was a jazz rehearsal on
Saturday afternoon, followed by tests on how well he knew his
scales--memorized, up to four flats and four sharps each. He'd be
expected to know them for the audition. Next, run-throughs of his
solo, "Bonita," and then practice at sight-reading.</LD>
<LD>   The Sunday morning audition was an arduous exercise of nerves,
willpower and poise, which he pulled off well. He knew beforehand
that his chances were iffy. He'd be one of the smallest and youngest
auditioners. Size gives a sound advantage for brass players, an
advantage he couldn't yet claim. Plus, he'd gotten braces a few
months earlier and had worked his lips raw trying to regain his
embouchure and range. They were good, but not as good as before the
braces.</LD>
<TE>   After the audition, he had time for a quick bite of lunch, then
off to the jazz concert where he improvised four pieces to the
cavernous, nearly vacant concert hall. It was a sparse crowd of
dutiful parents, hardly an unfamiliar face in the lot. Jarrod seemed
to enjoy the performances, but something was gnawing at him. Monday
night, he was back at it with the wind ensemble. Again, the same
faces, all filled with rapt enthusiasm--but we're the parents, of
course we're going to clap our hands numb.</TE>
<TE>   And Jarrod knew it.</TE>
<TE>   At his trumpet lesson the following day, his teacher decided he
needed a break. Instead of working on serious music, they goofed off
with a book of Christmas carols, playing "Jingle Bell Rock," "Frosty
the Snowman" and Jarrod's favorite, a jazzy version of "Feliz
Navidad," making each other laugh. For fun, the teacher let Jarrod
borrow the book of carols along with the CD accompaniment.</TE>
<TE>   "All you need now is a Santa hat and you can make some money
playing on Brand," his teacher joked about the main boulevard a few
blocks from our home in Glendale where a handful of street musicians
gather on Friday and Saturday nights.</TE>
<TE>   Jarrod laughed at the crack, said goodbye and left. I was a little
surprised the next day when he came home from school with a Santa
hat.</TE>
<TE>   That evening, I knew something was up. Though Jarrod loves
performing and rehearsing with a group, he hates practicing alone. I
usually have to cajole him. This night he went straight to work
without being asked. Soon, strains of "Let It Snow!" and "White
Christmas" filled the house. When practice time was over, he didn't
quit. I actually had to interrupt the carol fest to remind him he
still had homework to do.</TE>
<TE>   For the next three days, the carols came fast and furious out of
the bell of his trumpet, all played with the Santa hat in place, the
boombox by his feet. Could we actually let him do what he was
planning?</TE>
<TE>   "How much do you think a street performer can earn in a night?" he
asked after practicing for more than an hour.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know," I answered. "Why? Are you thinking about doing
that?"</TE>
<TE>   "Yeah. It would be kind of cool to play for people walking by,
have them stop to watch for a bit. And I might make some money."</TE>
<TE>   Now I was starting to panic, stumped as to how to handle this.
Could I let him perform on a street? A kid of 12? How many times had
I taken in the strains of street music, happy for the ambience the
musicians added? And yet, just as many times, I'd been embarrassed by
the players I'd seen, moved to pity by their sad attempts. Would my
son look pathetic? Worse, I wondered, is street performing the same
as begging?</TE>
<TE>   I didn't sleep well that night with the pros and cons rolling
around in my brain. He wants to play his music for others; that's an
admirable impulse. Yet, what will his presence on Brand, hat in hand,
say about me as a mother?  He kept practicing, and I kept hoping he'd
get sidetracked and forget about it. I called the Glendale Police
Department to find out about the legality. "A permit is required," I
was told. I heaved a sigh of relief. "But," the official continued,
"we don't enforce that rule unless someone's being a nuisance."
Strike two.</TE>
<TE>   Time was running short. On the Sunday before Christmas, Jarrod
announced he was ready. He'd practiced the songs and had worked up
all his courage; I'd run out of excuses. "You'll need batteries for
the boombox," I reminded him in a last-ditch effort to derail his
plan. He borrowed $12 for batteries, put on his performance clothes
and topped off the outfit with the Santa hat.</TE>
<TE>   I wasn't about to let him go alone. We walked to Brand, his
trumpet and boombox in hand. I was beginning to wish I'd made a sign
for myself: "I did not put him up to this." He found a spot in front
of a restaurant, arranged his things and adjusted his hat. For the
first time, the reality of what he was about to do hit him. He looked
panicked.</TE>
<TE>   "Just let me wait a minute."</TE>
<TE>   "You don't have to do this," I reminded him.</TE>
<TE>   A minute slipped by as he fingered the valves on his trumpet. Five
more minutes. "I'm just going to do it," he announced, his face pale
next to the red hat. He pushed the CD button, put the trumpet to his
lips and played. Tentative at first, but then strong and full.</TE>
<TE>   People gathered. Not much of a crowd, but shoppers stopping for a
song or two. A little boy, maybe 2, walked as close to the trumpet's
bell as he could get and stared in fascination. Jarrod played. And
played. A little boy and girl came by and danced to "Frosty,"
requesting the song again and again. People driving past  honked and
waved. A  few teens stopped long enough to bob their heads to the
beat.</TE>
<TE>   A few parents looked at me with what seemed reproach; a few others
grinned. Some tossed money into his case. As Jarrod played, a man
came up to me. "My son used to play the trumpet," he said. "It's nice
to see." Jarrod played until his lips went rubbery and then played
some more. A young man, who said he'd studied the trumpet for nine
years, handed me a scrap of paper on which he'd written a list of CDs
featuring outstanding trumpet players. "He might like these for
Christmas," he said, gesturing at Jarrod.</TE>
<TE>   Two hours straight. Between songs, I could see his lips were
getting swollen, but Jarrod didn't notice. His repertoire dwindled to
the four carols he could play without having to hit high notes and
those he played endlessly. By 9 o'clock, he was ready to call it
quits.</TE>
<TE>   "Did you see those little kids dancing?" he asked as we walked
home. "Their parents had to pull them away. They liked it!"</TE>
<TE>   His face was beaming in a different way than after the concerts or
auditions. The people who'd stopped to listen to him weren't dutiful
parents, music teachers or members of his extended family. They
didn't have to listen.</TE>
<TE>   I made Jarrod hot chocolate as he changed for bed. "Aren't you
going to count your money?" I asked. Looking back on the evening, it
struck me that he'd paid absolutely no attention to whether people
were tossing in cash as he played. I'd have guessed he'd be
calculating how many songs he'd have to play to earn a new Sony
PlayStation game. He never even looked.</TE>
<TE>   "So, you enjoyed it?" I asked.</TE>
<TE>   "I liked how people smiled and nodded," he said, dumping crumpled
dollars and handfuls of change onto the kitchen table. "They seemed
happy hearing me play."</TE>
<TE>   It hadn't been the cash after all, I realized. It was the little
kids dancing. The thumbs-up shoppers offered as they walked past. The
fact that complete strangers had stopped their busy lives to listen
to his music.</TE>
<TE>   On the table he made piles of dollar bills, a stack of quarters,
little towers of nickels and dimes, a hot chocolate smile staining
his upper lip. I was hoping he'd earned just enough to repay the loan
for the batteries and his career as a street performer would be over.</TE>
<TE>   A grin split his face as he announced the total: "Fifty dollars
and 6 cents." He leaped up and danced around the kitchen; I nearly
collapsed. "That's as much as I get for birthday money!" he sang.
"Can I go back tomorrow night?"</TE>
<TE>   So it wasn't the cash that had motivated him, but I guess it
didn't hurt.</TE>

<LD>The picturesque ski resort town of Park City, Utah, is once again
bracing for the annual onslaught of Hollywood filmmakers, executives,
agents and the attendant media coverage as the Sundance Film
Festival, the annual celebration of independent movies that was
co-founded by Robert Redford, kicks off Thursday--a little earlier
than usual because of the Winter Olympics in February.</LD>
<LD>   Already, locals report, more than 100 inches of snow has fallen on
the mountain hamlet, but that isn't such a bad thing, in the mind of
festival co-director Geoffrey Gilmore: "I always felt that every time
we get a lot of snow, it calms everybody down a little bit and
creates a nice atmosphere."</LD>
<LD>   This year, 16 films are finalists in the dramatic competition,
ranging from "Personal Velocity," a film starring Kyra Sedgwick,
Parker Posey and Fairuza Balk about three women trying to deal with
difficult romantic relationships, to "Narc," a gritty drama starring
Ray Liotta, Jason Patric and Busta Rhymes about big-city cops
investigating a colleague's murder.</LD>
<TE>   The big question on many people's minds is whether any of this
year's films will become next year's Oscar candidates.</TE>
<TE>   It's become common for films that unspool at Sundance to go on to
become the hottest independent films of the year. "In the Bedroom"
and "Memento" were both discovered at last year's Sundance and now
are two of the most talked-about films of the year.</TE>
<TE>   This year, there is already considerable buzz about a new Jennifer
Aniston film, "The Good Girl," which is premiering at Sundance but is
not part of the competition.</TE>
<TE>   It concerns a young wife who begins an affair with an oddball
stock boy who thinks he's Holden Caulfield, protagonist of J.D.
Salinger's novel "The Catcher in the Rye."</TE>

<HD>'Fear Factor' Scares Up a Weekly Spot</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Two high-profile, unscripted series pass in the night this week, as
NBC's summer hit "Fear Factor" returns as a regular weekly program
tonight, and the third edition of CBS' "Survivor" concludes Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   This sort-of baton pass takes place after a fall that saw most
so-called "reality" shows, with "Survivor" an exception, die on the
ratings vine, though a celebrity "Fear Factor" bucked that trend and
generated strong ratings in November. The question is how well the
NBC show--reviled by critics when it premiered in June--holds up
against original fare, as opposed to summer reruns.</LD>
<LD>   "Fear Factor" irked critics with its stomach-churning stunts, but
the program also drew a strong tune-in among the young adults most
sought by advertisers. Balanced against those gains is the fact that
some contend the program sullies NBC's image as the home of
high-quality series such as "The West Wing" and "Frasier"--a charge
NBC Entertainment President Jeff Zucker has flatly dismissed.</LD>
<TE>   Anticipating a drubbing from reporters, Zucker wore a bulletproof
vest to NBC's semiannual session with TV critics in July.
Appropriately, NBC faces those same reporters and critics again
Wednesday, by which time the ratings will indicate whether "Fear" is
destined to be a flash in the pan or a true factor in prime time.

<HD>This Apartment Comes With Skeletons Hanging in the Closet</HD>
<DH>In 'My Old Lady,' Israel Horovitz tells a familiar story
about family secrets. The big difference? Well, it's set in Paris.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DON SHIRLEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES THEATER WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Family secrets tumble out of the past in Israel Horovitz's "My Old
Lady." This kind of clearing of the domestic cupboard is an awfully
familiar subject for American drama. Horovitz attempts to distinguish
his treatment of it by setting the action in Paris.</LD>
<LD>   The setting provides some room for rumination on cross-cultural as
well as intra-family issues. Yet the play, in a Mark Taper Forum
production at the Doolittle Theatre in Hollywood, is more successful
at unearthing family drama than in exploring transatlantic themes,
which tend to devolve here into stereotypes about Americans and
Europeans.</LD>
<LD>   Even with the family material, Horovitz's success is modest. The
play feels muffled by its preoccupation with past events that are
only discussed, not shown. Horovitz's attempt to bring the drama into
the present and the future isn't entirely convincing.</LD>
<TE>   Still, under David Esbjornson's direction, the play provides a
platform for a charged performance by Peter Friedman as a troubled
American in Paris--a self-defined loser who nevertheless powers the
play's momentum with his unrelenting search for his own history.</TE>
<TE>   Detailed discussion of "My Old Lady" is difficult without
revealing some of the plot's pivotal moments. Anyone who's seeing the
play and wants to be totally surprised by its revelations may want to
postpone reading the rest of this review for now.</TE>
<TE>   But first, the set-up: Mathias Gold (Friedman), 50, has inherited
a Paris apartment from his father, from whom he has been estranged
most of his life. Virtually penniless and a lonely veteran of three
failed marriages, Mathias hopes to sell the flat quickly and return
to America.</TE>
<TE>   Arriving in Paris, he finds two women still living in the
apartment: nonagenarian Mathilde (Sian Phillips) and her 50ish
daughter Chloe (Jan Maxwell).</TE>
<TE>   Mathias soon learns that his father's below-market purchase of the
apartment from Mathilde was contingent on a proviso that she can
remain there until she dies. Even worse for Mathias, his father had
agreed to pay a monthly fee for Mathilde's expenses--a debt that
Mathias has now inherited.</TE>
<TE>   Chloe initially threatens legal action if Mathias tries to evict
the duo, but all three characters soon conclude that coercion
probably won't resolve their conflicts. So they settle in for a
series of conversations that evolve into probes of the past. Both of
the younger people become aware of hitherto unknown family ties.</TE>
<TE>   Despite his excessive drinking, or maybe because of it, Friedman's
Mathias eloquently makes the case that his life was wrecked by his
father. Although Mathilde argues that a 50-year-old should assume
responsibility for his own life, Mathias finally spits out a
revelation of his own that shakes up Mathilde's and Chloe's
assumptions.</TE>
<TE>   Friedman has a picturesque ring of matted hair around his largely
bald pate that helps endow Mathias' more neurotic moments with an
element of charm. And he has a fierce energy that elevates mere
whining into a more profound existential rant. His climactic loss of
composure is the most moving moment in the play.</TE>
<TE>   Phillips' Mathilde is generally luminous and dignified, but
Phillips can't quite hide the fact that she is almost three decades
younger than her character. Mathilde is stuck with a common curse of
colorful old women characters: She is allowed to name-drop her way
through all of the famous bohemian residents of Paris she knew.</TE>
<TE>   Maxwell's Chloe also looks a bit younger than her character. She
is asked to make an enormous leap from her initial fury at Mathias
to, well, the opposite emotion, as she learns to regard him as a
fellow wounded child. Maxwell's performance is more convincing in
this regard than is Horovitz's script, which feels especially
contorted in the final scene to provide a thoroughly upbeat ending.</TE>
<TE>   Conveniently enough, Mathilde and Chloe have worked as English
teachers, so the use of English throughout most of the play doesn't
feel odd, until they continue to use it in a confrontation between
the two of them, when Mathias isn't in the room.</TE>
<TE>   John Lee Beatty designed a sitting room that looks well lived-in.
Jon Gottlieb's sound, including original music by Peter Golub, helps
ease the transitions.</TE>
<TE>   "My Old Lady" isn't as compelling as some of Horovitz's other
recent plays produced in 99-seat venues in L.A., probably because
those plays were more urgently in the present tense. The characters
here are intriguing, but they feel constrained by the form that
Horovitz chose.</TE>

<HD>The Opposing Corners in Today's 'Ali' Matchup</HD>
<DH>Wayward of plot, the film fails to place the fighter in the
context of 1960s civil rights struggles, making him seem little more
than an impetuous showoff.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>EARL OFARI HUTCHINSON</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The week before and after the release of "Ali," I devoured every
review and article I could get my hands on about the film and its
making. The critics have generally given high marks to the film, and
to Will Smith's performance as Ali. Though Times film critic Kenneth
Turan felt the film could have done much more to capture the inner
essence of Ali, he still praised it as a decent, workmanlike effort.</LD>
<LD>   I was delighted with the positive, even loving, spin the writers
gave the film. I have been an unabashed fan of Muhammad Ali since he
first burst on the sports scene four decades ago. I've seen all of
his major fights and reveled in his victories. I cheered him the
times I heard him speak, personally spoke with him on several
occasions, and even helped sponsor and promote two of the talks he
gave at the college I attended in the years that the sports
establishment slammed the door shut on him.</LD>
<LD>   When Ali refused the draft, embraced the Black Muslims, opposed
the Vietnam War and refused Army induction, I applauded him for
having the courage to stand up for his political and religious
beliefs, to speak out for racial justice, and for his willingness to
pay the steep price for doing so. This marked him as a true "People's
Champ."</LD>
<TE>   Armed with this lifelong admiration for Ali, and bolstered by the
loud praise of the critics, I felt there was no way the film could
miss. Unfortunately, it does, in three troubling ways.</TE>
<TE>   The first miss is the plot. There is none. It rambles disjointedly
from scene to scene, or maybe I should say vignette to vignette, with
no central or defined focus. Many of the scenes--such as the opening
one, with singer Sam Cooke crooning to a nightclub audience--have
absolutely no relevance to the story line and seem to be tossed in as
one of many fillers in the film. Some of the characters are only
marginally identified, and this makes it difficult, if not
impossible, to figure out their relationship or significance to Ali.</TE>
<TE>   The second miss is in failing to take the audience into account.
The majority of filmgoers are under age 35. Many weren't born when
Ali fought his titanic fights inside and outside the ring. What
lessons about the struggle and sacrifice he made and the history that
went into that struggle and sacrifice can they draw from a film that
neglects to tell what drove Ali to prevail?</TE>
<TE>   The worst miss is that the film fails to place Ali against the
defining influence and monumental impact that the 1960s civil rights
and black power movements had on young blacks (and non-blacks) of
that era. These movements shaped Ali's political and religious
convictions. They explain why he was willing to risk his career and
financial ruin to oppose the Vietnam War and the draft. The short
shrift given these movements makes Ali seem little more than an
impetuous, headstrong showboat who took controversial stands simply
because he wanted to.</TE>
<TE>   The two pivotal characters who defined the 1960s black movement
fare poorly in the film. Martin Luther King Jr. is seen only
fleetingly in a picture, shaking hands with Malcolm X. But how many
filmgoers under, or for that matter over, age 30 would know that it's
King? Malcolm comes off as a bland, lurking presence with none of the
passion and fire that made Malcolm, well, Malcolm.</TE>
<TE>   The two men and the movements they represented profoundly
influenced the young Ali. Not only is this missing, but one scene
even stands historical truth about King on its head. Ali's attorney
is talking to him on a pay phone at the Lorraine Motel in Memphis the
moment that King is shot. The conversation didn't happen at that time
and place, and even if it did, there is absolutely no hint that it
was King who lay dying on the balcony of the motel.</TE>
<TE>   Ali absorbed the hardest blows that ferocious opponents, a hostile
government, a fickle public and a vengeful sports establishment could
throw at him. He beat them all, and in the process showed that he
really did have the stuff of greatness. The pity is that "Ali"
doesn't.</TE>

<HD>'Hello, He Lied' Tells Truth About Producers</HD>
<DH>Television* An American Movie Classics special based on
producer Lynda Obst's 1996 best-selling memoir outlines the lives of
Hollywood dealmakers.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LYNN ELBER</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Take the telephone firmly in hand and dial the first of some 60
calls. Take a half-dozen meetings, often at chic restaurants where
the point is the deal, not the meal. Be rejected countless times.</LD>
<LD>   This is the life of a Hollywood producer as jauntily outlined in
"Hello, He Lied," an American Movie Classics special loosely based on
producer Lynda Obst's 1996 bestselling memoir.</LD>
<LD>   Moviemaking is hell for the man or woman who sees a film through
assembly, production and distribution, according to the documentary
from Shari Springer Berman and Robert Pulcini.</LD>
<TE>   "Hello, He Lied" jumps lightly over the subject that Obst's book
covered in intimate detail. Instead, it offers Obst as host and the
experiences of other top producers to explain how the game is played.</TE>
<TE>   The game, at first, seems very fuzzy. As veteran producer David
Brown ("Jaws," "The Sting") acknowledges, "Nobody knows what a
producer does, including the producer's wife."</TE>
<TE>   Schmoozing apparently takes up a good part of the day, with
writers, agents and studio decision-makers among the producer's chief
targets.</TE>
<TE>   This frenzy of fellowship is aimed at locating good material,
convincing a studio the idea is worth pursuing and persuading actors
and directors to enlist in your cause.</TE>
<TE>   Between script and the green light for production comes what
Hollywood fondly refers to as "development hell."</TE>
<TE>   There's one particularly telling scene in "Hello, He Lied" in
which a veteran writer warily fields suggestions from fresh-faced
studio executives.</TE>
<TE>   One exec comments that he's cool toward the story about Napoleon
because "this era just never appealed to me on a visual level."</TE>
<TE>   The clearly annoyed writer parries: "I don't take that personally
because I feel like your tie defines your ... taste."</TE>
<TE>   A script that passes through development takes a huge step toward
getting the green light if a big star can be "attached" to the
project, so it's back to networking for the producer.</TE>
<TE>   The documentary supplies a list of four top Los Angeles-area
schmooze spots, including a yoga center, parents' night at a
particular private school and the In-N-Out Burger on Sunset
Boulevard.</TE>
<TE>   All this effort and not a minute of film has been shot.</TE>
<TE>   Given that the average Hollywood movie costs about $65 million,
most of the scripts bouncing around town will never see the dark of a
movie theater.</TE>
<TE>   If a film does get made and, by a miracle, is a hit, the general
public likely will applaud the stars, the director, even (rarely) the
writer before the producer gets a nod.</TE>
<TE>   And the money, Obst suggests, is not all it's cracked up to be.</TE>
<TE>   So just what is the attraction of producing?</TE>
<TE>   "My theory is that when producers were really young their mothers
dropped them on their head," a wry Obst said in an interview, before
getting serious.</TE>
<TE>   "I think there are people who are in love with making movies, with
the sort of Irving Thalberg ideal of being a producer, of managing
something into existence and then being a sort of den mother to its
talent."</TE>
<TE>   Producing calls for an entrepreneurial instinct, Obst said. "It's
people who feel they can get their best work done managing talented
people rather than being the talent themselves."</TE>
<TE>   She has experienced the highs and lows of her chosen career. There
are films she's proud of, including "Sleepless in Seattle" and "The
Fisher King," some of which had the added bonus of being box-office
hits.</TE>
<TE>   Obst's greatest disappointment came when a long-nurtured project,
"The Hot Zone," stalled after she had Robert Redford and Jodie Foster
attached, as well as director Ridley Scott ("Alien").</TE>
<TE>   A rival Ebola virus drama, "Outbreak," beat Obst to the punch and
"The Hot Zone" went cold. Such heartbreak is not included in AMC's
"Hello, He Lied," but there are signs aplenty that producing is a
tough gig.</TE>
<TE>   But listen to the soft-spoken, intelligent Brown and you get the
impression there's some room for art and passion in Hollywood. It's
the likes of Brown and Saul Zaentz ("The English Patient") who serve
as inspiration, young producer Gary Foster comments in "Hello, He
Lied."</TE>
<TE>   They are "producers that cared about the material, nurtured the
material and found a way to get their movies made, no matter how long
it took," Foster says. "That, to me, is what a producer does."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   "Hello, He Lied" can be seen Tuesday at 7 and 10 p.m. on AMC.</TE>

<HD>Looks Like He Made It</HD>
<DH>Barry Manilow rebounds from bronchitis with an energetic
show at the Kodak.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DON HECKMAN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"Hack a hit" was Barry Manilow's apt introductory description to his
concert at the Kodak Theatre on Friday. And to some extent he was
right.</LD>
<LD>   Still coughing and snorting with symptoms of the bronchitis that
forced him to cancel his bookings the previous week at the Kodak
(with the exception of an appearance on New Year's Eve), he
nonetheless delivered a characteristically high-spirited
presentation, repeatedly generating impassioned shouts and cheers
from an adulatory, packed-house crowd.</LD>
<LD>   Manilow, 55, springs from a generation of songwriters who came to
maturity during an era when songs had a life of their own, not
necessarily associated solely with their composers, pliable enough to
suit the styles of a variety of singers.</LD>
<TE>   And one of the most meaningful aspects of his craft as a singer is
his ability to bring songs vividly to life, regardless of their
source. ("I Write the Songs" and "Mandy," for example--two of his
biggest hits--were composed, respectively, by Bruce Johnston and by
Scott English and Richard Kerr. Few would question that Manilow has
made them his own.)</TE>
<TE>   The current Manilow tour, which kicked off last month in Las
Vegas, supports a new album--"Here at the Mayflower"--on a new (for
Manilow) label, Concord.</TE>
<TE>   But far too wise a showman to concentrate solely on new material,
he spent a good portion of the program touring through his remarkable
collection of hit songs--"Even Now," "Looks Like We Made It,"
"Copacabana," "Mandy" and "I Write the Songs," to name only a few
that surfaced individually and in medleys.</TE>
<TE>   Sounding in fine vocal form and striding the stage confidently,
Manilow displayed his capacity to bring style and drama to his
interpretations. Although his own songs--at least those targeted at
the pop charts--tend to rely on similar combinations of suspended
chords, dramatic shifts of key and theatrical climaxes, he delivered
them with a directness and an openness that more than compensated for
their often contrived qualities.</TE>
<TE>   The balance of the performance, however, revealed a creative
duality that has long been present in Manilow's art.</TE>
<TE>   Enormously successful as a pop act, he is clearly drawn to the
musical theater's richer potential for artistic subtleties.</TE>
<TE>   Two of the evening's selections were from a Manilow
musical-in-progress based upon the pre-World War II story of
Germany's Comedian Harmonists--a popular vocal ensemble destroyed by
the Nazi regime. "Harmony," the title song, was Manilow at his
creative best, reaching into layers of musicality rarely present in
his pop items.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The songs from "Here at the Mayflower" didn't quite reach the same
level of achievement. But the format--a collection of numbers
describing people and events in the units of an urban apartment
building--was thematic enough to allow Manilow's imagination to rove
freely. "Not What You See," a lovely description of an elderly
couple, was typical--performed in touching, eminently believable
fashion.</TE>
<TE>   With dozens of tour dates lined up for 2002, it's likely that
Manilow's creative duality will continue to remain unresolved. But
the brief taste of "Harmony" and portions of "Mayflower" suggest
that--despite his many pop music successes--Manilow still possesses a
great deal of unfulfilled creative potential.</TE>

<HD>For Versatile Sheila E., It's a Family Affair</HD>
<DH>The accomplished musician's set includes accompaniment from
siblings, her mother and her Latin percussionist father, Pete
Escovedo.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DON HECKMAN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Sheila E. may be best known in the pop world for her association with
Prince in the early '80s and her own crossover pop solo efforts of
the past decade and a half. But, as Sheila Escovedo, the eldest
offspring of Latin percussionist Pete Escovedo and his wife, Juanita,
and a superb drummer in her own right, she is at her musical finest
when she is roving freely through the rhythms of funk, jazz, rhythm &amp;
blues and salsa.</LD>
<LD>   On Saturday night at La Ve Lee in Studio City, she was also a
consummate leader. Seated behind a drum set on the stage, which had
been atmospherically set up with candles, plants and a television set
("to create a homey atmosphere," said singer Lynn Mabry), Escovedo
led her five-piece E Train ensemble through a collection of material
ranging from Stevie Wonder ("Don't You Worry 'Bout a Thing") and Sly
and the Family Stone ("Thank You [Falettinme Be Mice Elf Agin]") to
the Crusaders ("Street Life") and Brenda Russell ("Walkin' in New
York").</LD>
<LD>   Choosing to sing only a few back-up harmonies, she placed Mabry's
dark-timbred voice and arching blues phrases into the spotlight. It
was a good choice, given Mabry's easy craftsmanship and fluently
communicative style.</LD>
<TE>   Other players stepped into the spotlight from time to time, but
the engine that drove the proceedings was the potent combination of
Escovedo and bassist Marc Van Waginengen. In her only extended drum
solo, Escovedo demonstrated an ear for texture and sound, perfectly
balancing her irrepressible inner rhythmic surge. She is, by almost
any definition, one of the most versatile and imaginative drummers in
the current music scene.</TE>
<TE>   Typically, the evening wound up with a family jam session, as
brother Peter Michael Escovedo and paterfamilias Pete Escovedo came
on stage for a climactic closing number. As so often happens when
this amazingly simpatico group gets together, the friendly musical
competitiveness produced some impressive rhythmic results.</TE>
<TE>   Further enhancing the familial connectiveness, Sheila Escovedo
called her sister Gina on stage to dance a few samba steps, while
mother Juanita, seated nearby, supported the rhythm with a shaker and
shouts of enthusiastic encouragement.</TE>
<TE>   The message by the end of the set was perfectly clear: When you
see the name Escovedo listed anywhere for a club booking, there's a
good chance that you'll get more Escovedos than you expect. And you
will, without a doubt, be treated to an entertaining evening of high
musical excitement.</TE>

<HD>A Quick-Witted Link in the Chain</HD>
<DH>Television* Veteran host George Gray dons the spectacles
and sharpens his attitude to host a daytime version of 'Weakest
Link.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SUSAN KING</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>George Gray, the host of the new syndicated daytime version of
"Weakest Link," isn't as intimidating or as caustic as his prime-time
counterpart, Anne Robinson. But he does manage to lob a few choice
zingers at the contestants.</LD>
<LD>   "They are called the 'who slams,'" said Gray. Among his best "who
slams" is "Who here is the Tito of this Jackson 5?"</LD>
<LD>   "George's tone is very much in keeping with the philosophy of the
show--you call [the contestants] on their flaws," said Linda Finnell,
senior vice president of programming for NBC Enterprises, which is
producing the syndicated version. "I know George says he teases
people, but I look at him as that bad boy in the class--the one who
was cutting up in the back of the room and getting sent to the
principal's office. He's very adorable in that sort of way. He's kind
of the bad boy you love to love. He's smart as a whip and very quick
and very funny."</LD>
<TE>   "Weakest Link" began as a daily quiz show on the BBC in England
and was quickly followed by an equally successful prime-time version
hosted by petite, bespectacled journalist Robinson. NBC introduced
its prime-time version--also hosted by Robinson--last spring.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike the hourlong prime-time version, the syndicated series is
only 30 minutes. Instead of eight contestants, there are six people
vying for $75,000. There is also one less round of questions.</TE>
<TE>   Finnell said the producers searched for months to find the right
host. Robinson opted out of the daytime show because of her busy
schedule. Not only does she host the NBC nighttime installment, but
she still hosts the series in England.</TE>
<TE>   "She has a heck of a commute when she comes over to do the network
show," Finnell said. "When we went to look to find someone for the
syndicated show, which is, obviously, a full-time job, everybody kept
saying to me, 'You have to find a journalist like Anne.' Or somebody
else would say, 'You need to find a stand-up comic because they need
to be funny.' And then somebody would say, 'No, you need someone who
can ask really tough questions every time.'"</TE>
<TE>   In the final analysis, Finnell said, they needed someone who could
just do the show successfully. "The really good people make it look
easy," she said. "This is a tough show to do. It's part game show,
part talk show, in a way. I don't want to say it's part reality show,
but with the vote-off factor and the kick-off factor [of the
contestants], I think it is a bit more than being a game show. The
host has to have the ability to listen, to be quick on his feet and
to be entertaining all at the same time."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Gray fit all the requirements. During a recent phone interview, he
joked that it was his parole officer who suggested him for the job.
"I wear an orange vest under the black suit," he said with tongue
firmly in cheek.</TE>
<TE>   "Everybody involved knew who I was. [Executive producer] Phil
Gurin and I had done a pilot for a series a few months earlier. It
was for a kind of reality show, and he knew who I was. A lot of the
players at NBC Enterprises knew me because they had seen me do warmup
[comedy], which I had done for years, for a lot of television shows."</TE>
<TE>   Among the series he was the warmup act for was the ill-fated
daytime talk show with Tammy Faye Bakker and Jim J. Bullock. "It was
hysterical," Gray said. "It was a train wreck. I love train wrecks."</TE>
<TE>   Prior to "Weakest Link," Gray hosted TBS' "Movies for Guys Who
Like Movies," the Game Show Network's "Extreme Gong" and the Learning
Channel's "Junkyard Wars," for which he shared an Emmy nomination for
outstanding nonfiction program.</TE>
<TE>   "I have flown under the radar," he said. "For the past five or six
years, I have had a television show on the air, but I am not a
household name. But it has allowed me to earn my chops. I have been
known as the guy who just kind of wings it. It really comes in handy
on this show. They said to me, 'Don't try to be Anne. Be yourself.
Have fun. You are good at what you do, so do it.' I like winging it."</TE>
<TE>   The syndicated 'Weakest Link" is shot on the same set as the
prime-time version, though a new podium was made for Gray, who is
taller than Robinson. Like Robinson, he is also dressed entirely in
black and wears glasses. The spectacles, Gray stresses, are not an
affectation.</TE>
<TE>   "I'll hand my glasses to anybody to let them look through them to
prove that I do not see that well," he said. Though he didn't wear
glasses for his other hosting chores--none of his previous series was
scripted--Gray realized he would need his glasses to read the
questions to the contestants. "So I said to my friends before I went
on the audition, 'You know, maybe I should wear my glasses for this.
I could actually read the questions and it would go with the whole
vibe of the show.' The real treat is I actually can see everybody in
the studio!"</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   "Weakest Link" can be seen weekdays at 3 and 3:30 p.m. on KNBC. It
has been rated TV-G (suitable for all audiences).</TE>

<HD>Riefenstahl Plans Release of Film About Her Scuba Dives</HD>

<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>BERLIN</DL>
<LD>Filmmaker Leni Riefenstahl plans to release a new movie in August to
coincide with her 100th birthday, the Die Welt newspaper said Sunday.</LD>
<LD>   Her new 45-minute movie, "Underwater Impressions," will compile
footage from the more than 2,000 scuba dives she made in the Indian
Ocean from 1974 to 2000, Die Welt's report said.</LD>
<LD>   Riefenstahl found herself blacklisted because of her work for the
Third Reich. "Triumph of the Will," a powerful documentary of the
1934 Nazi party rally in Nuremberg, helped cement Adolf Hitler's
image as Germany's all-powerful leader.</LD>
<TE>   The last feature film Riefenstahl released was "Tiefland" in 1954.</TE>

<HD>Characters Collide in 'Copenhagen'</HD>
<DH>Like the atomic particles they discuss, the historical
figures who move through Michael Frayn's play bounce in unexpected
and tantalizing directions.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DARYL H. MILLER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"Mathematics becomes very odd when you apply it to people," says one
of the physicist characters in "Copenhagen." "One plus one can add up
to so many different sums...."</LD>
<LD>   This tantalizing incalculability suffuses Michael Frayn's play,
which has thrilled audiences in London, New York and Los Angeles.
While the main national tour concluded its L.A. run over the weekend,
another production, based on the same staging, opened at the Laguna
Playhouse before traveling to some smaller cities that the other tour
won't reach.</LD>
<LD>   The Laguna Beach staging is essentially the same as the previous
ones, which leaves its new actors as the variables. As of Saturday's
opening, they weren't quite computing. Still, they showed promise;
with a few more performances behind them, they should be able to
propel this production toward the same heights as the others.</LD>
<TE>   Part of the thrill of Frayn's play is reaching its end and feeling
you've understood it. The dialogue is filled to bursting with names,
dates and places, along with principles of quantum physics and
nuclear fission.</TE>
<TE>   The characters, meanwhile, behave in the same tricky,
hard-to-quantify manner as the atomic particles they're discussing.</TE>
<TE>   The mystery at the play's core is a real one. In 1941, when both
the Germans and the Allies were trying to assess the viability of
nuclear weaponry, two pioneers of atomic physics--the German Werner
Heisenberg and the Dane Niels Bohr--met secretly while Heisenberg was
visiting Copenhagen. Heisenberg, the developer of the uncertainty
principle, had been a student of Bohr, whose understanding of the
atom had led to breakthroughs in quantum theory.</TE>
<TE>   Was Heisenberg trying to get his former mentor to reveal knowledge
of the Allies' nuclear plans? Or was he trying to warn Bohr of
Germany's designs? And, had Heisenberg been able to ascertain the
Allies' progress, would he have worked more diligently to provide
Germany with an atomic weapon? Or was he trying to establish an
understanding by which physicists on both sides would stall progress
toward instruments of mass destruction?</TE>
<TE>   Frayn sets the action in the afterlife, as Heisenberg (Sean
Arbuckle) tries once again to make his intentions clear to Bohr
(William Cain) and his sharp-witted wife, Margrethe (Tanny McDonald).
They meet in a heavenly lecture hall, re-created with the same
curving, blond-wood walls and global floor inlay as seen in Los
Angeles, but without the seating gallery that turned some
theatergoers into onstage observers.</TE>
<TE>   Michael Blakemore's original staging, which puts the actors in
electron-like orbits, also has been re-created.</TE>
<TE>   Cain gives Bohr a gruffness born of intellectual rigor. His line
delivery is not as musical as that of singer-actor Len Cariou in Los
Angeles, but it has its own raspy sonority.</TE>
<TE>   Arbuckle nicely balances Heisenberg's heady impetuosity with
cautious calculation. The approach is more reserved than the
daredevil, college-boy tack taken by Hank Stratton, but just as
valid. And while McDonald hasn't yet found the complexity in
Margrethe that Mariette Hartley displayed, she lends gravity to the
proceedings.</TE>
<TE>   The characters' final, particle-like collision results not in an
explosion, but a hug. Frayn seems to suggest that if people can but
reach a moment of understanding, catastrophe might be averted. As the
nuclear powers of India and Pakistan stare each other down, that

<HD>A Record, but With Qualifiers</HD>
<DH>Box Office* The $8-billion mark is topped for the first
time, but admissions remain flat.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD NATALE</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It's now official: 2001 was the largest-grossing year ever at North
American movie theaters, the first time the motion picture industry
topped the $8-billion level in admissions.</LD>
<LD>   The big hits were bigger, with six releases topping the
$200-million mark: "Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone" (which
just crossed the $300-million mark), "Shrek," "Monsters, Inc." "Rush
Hour 2," "The Mummy Returns" and, over the past weekend, "The Lord of
the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring."</LD>
<LD>   The previous high was four, in 1999, the year of "Star Wars:
Episode I The Phantom Menace," "The Sixth Sense" and the sequels to
"Toy Story" and "Austin Powers."</LD>
<TE>   While the major studio blockbusters received more than their share
of media attention, the studios exerted damage control over the
year's major duds, which came and went without the kind of ballyhoo
that tarnished such classic catastrophes as "Ishtar" and "Heaven's
Gate," though those flops cost as much (adjusted for inflation) as
some of this year's flops, such as "Monkeybone," "Town and Country,"
"Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within," "Driven" and "The Majestic," all
of which had sticker prices of at least $70 million.</TE>
<TE>   Curiously, more was written about the relative disappointment of
"Pearl Harbor," a three-hour war movie that ended up grossing $450
million around the world, the kind of disappointment every studio
wishes it had on a more regular basis.</TE>
<TE>   According to EDI/Nielsen, which started its calculations on Jan.
5, 2001, the year ended up with $8.13 billion in gross receipts,
whereas the competing tracking firm Exhibitor Relations, which
calculates starting on Jan. 1, is reporting $8.35 billion.</TE>
<TE>   Almost two-thirds of the increased revenue from 2001 came from the
top 10 releases, which often debuted on more than 5,000 screens.</TE>
<TE>   Nonetheless, ticket sales remained flat. EDI calculates admissions
at slightly below the 1998 record of 1.44 billion tickets, while
Exhibitor Relations tags it slightly above, with 1.49 billion. The
average ticket price was calculated at $5.60, up 20 cents from the
previous year.</TE>
<TE>   According to EDI President Tom Borys, admissions have remained
generally flat for many years now and aren't expected to vary much in
the future; the American and Canadian public's moviegoing patterns
are pretty much set. Future gains in revenue for the industry, he
says, will therefore come from higher ticket prices, foreign box
office and the increasingly lucrative after-life of video, television
and, more recently, DVD sales.</TE>
<TE>   The advent of the megaplex in the mid-1990s was supposed to
provide more theaters for more movies. But while some of these
complexes house as many as 20 auditoriums, it's rare for there to be
more than a half-dozen movies playing at a given time, particularly
in summer and during the holidays, the movie industry's best seasons.</TE>
<TE>   The stronger performers, such as "Harry Potter" or "Planet of the
Apes," are often allotted more than one-third of those screens, which
accounts for their gigantic opening weekend takes--and, often, their
precipitous second weekend drops. Gone are the days when wary patrons
sat out the first one or two weeks of a hit film's run because of
long lines. Multiplexes can now accommodate as much business as a
film can manage its first weekend simply by shifting lesser movies
out and offering a maximum number of seats and staggered showtimes
for the weekend's hit title.</TE>
<TE>   The public's romance with 2001's "event" movies was thus
passionate and immediate, but usually short-lived. Even the biggest
movie of the year, "Harry Potter," did about one-third of its
business in the first five days of release.</TE>
<TE>   But the "one weekend" theory of filmgoing is somewhat misleading.
The maxim "If you blitz advertise it, they will come" didn't prevent
some lesser-hyped movies from slipping into theaters and building a
loyal following in later weeks--diverse titles such as "Memento,"
"The Others," "Legally Blonde," "The Princess Diaries" and "Bridget
Jones's Diary." Movie audiences still like to "discover" movies and
tell their friends.</TE>
<TE>   "The specialized film actually did quite well this year," says
Borys, who mentions that two of last year's late arrivals, "Crouching
Tiger, Hidden Dragon" and "Traffic," actually did more than 90% of
their business in 2001.</TE>
<TE>   Notably, family films were the best performers in 2001--five of
the six movies that grossed $200 million were family titles. With
increasing pressure from Washington, studios assiduously trimmed
films to avoid the R rating and many theaters more stringently
policed ticket-buyers younger than age 17. As a result, says Borys,
only 27% of admissions were for R-rated films this year, compared to
35% in 2000. Just two of the 20 top-grossing films, "Hannibal" and
"American Pie 2," carried an R rating.</TE>
<TE>   The summer season, when about 40% of tickets are sold, was a
standout, with 14 of the year's top 20 movies coming from May to
early September.</TE>
<TE>   The films released this holiday season have more than held their
own against last year, one of the better periods in recent memory
with such major hits as "Dr. Seuss' How the Grinch Stole Christmas,"
"Cast Away" and "What Women Want."</TE>
<TE>   This year's star is "The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the
Ring," which in less than three weeks has grossed more than $205
million, capturing about $23 million over the past weekend. "Lord"
won the American Film Institute's award for best picture on Saturday
along with technical awards, fueling speculation that it could be
among the best picture nominees when the Academy Award nominations
are announced next month. That could prolong "Rings'" theatrical life
and give "Harry Potter" a run for the final box-office crown among
2001 releases.</TE>
<TE>   "Harry Potter" took a post-holiday drop to a still-handy $6.1
million over the weekend, becoming the first movie in almost two
years to gross more than $300 million.</TE>
<TE>   Another potential Oscar candidate is "A Beautiful Mind," starring
Russell Crowe, which leaped to second place in its first wide-release
weekend on 1,855 screens with an estimated $17 million. "Mind" has
already mined more than $38 million at the box office and looks to
end up in the $100-million arena.</TE>
<TE>   Now in third place, "Ocean's Eleven" is still nimble, with $11.8
million expected in its fifth weekend. The heist romp has now
purloined more than $150 million. The animated movie "Jimmy Neutron:
Boy Genius" is a family hit, with $9.2 million over the past weekend
and a smart $62.5 million in only three weeks. "Monsters, Inc."
grossed approximately $4 million in its 10th weekend, pushing its
total to about $245 million.</TE>
<TE>   Two of the season's quirkier titles are doing strong business in
general release. Wes Anderson's "The Royal Tenenbaums," a wry look at
an eccentric, dysfunctional family, climbed to fifth place in its
first national break. On only 751 screens, "Tenenbaums" grossed an
excellent $8.8 million, bringing it to $21 million. Cameron Crowe's
"Vanilla Sky," a remake of the experimental Spanish drama "Open Your
Eyes" starring Tom Cruise, is holding better than Cruise's last
offbeat effort, "Eyes Wide Shut." Its fourth weekend added about $7.2
million, elevating the romantic drama to more than $81 million to
date.</TE>
<TE>   At this rate "Vanilla Sky," could be another $100-million grosser
for the consistent Cruise.</TE>
<TE>   Michael Mann's boxing biography "Ali," however, is demonstrating
wobbly legs. Second-weekend grosses were down by almost half from the
first weekend to a relatively lightweight $7.6 million. The $49
million collected to date is somewhat disappointing in light of
expectations for the story of legendary boxing champion Muhammad Ali,
especially given star Will Smith's proven drawing power.</TE>
<TE>   In eighth place, the Meg Ryan romance "Kate &amp; Leopold" is doing OK
business, with $6.7 million in its second weekend and $31 million so
far. The sci-fi drama "Impostor" didn't get much of a toehold in its
first weekend in 1,870 theaters, with a weak $3.2 million expected.</TE>
<TE>   Up and comers, which will go into wider release in the coming
weeks, include Robert Altman's British ensemble film "Gosford Park,"
which expanded to 131 theaters over the weekend, boasting a strong
$1.5 million and $2.2 million to date.</TE>
<TE>   "In the Bedroom" also fared well as it climbed to 207 screens for
a $1.7 million take and $4.3 million to date. "The Shipping News" is
coasting with $1.2 million expected in 213 theaters and $4.3 million
so far.</TE>
<TE>   The standout among these seems to be the Somalia war drama "Black
Hawk Down," which was selling out on four screens, grossing $200,000
over the weekend, taking it to $566,000 before its Jan. 18 national
release.</TE>

<HD>The Opposing Corners in Today's 'Ali' Matchup</HD>
<DH>Michael Mann's film features a remarkable performance by
Will Smith and provides insight into the former boxing champion.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SHANE SALERNO</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Kenneth Turan, the respected film critic of The Times, has failed to
grasp the specific narrative objectives and intentions of Michael
Mann's film "Ali." His review ("Floats, and Stings, Like a
Butterfly," Dec. 25) would do well to follow the advice of the
advertising slogan created for Oscar winner "American Beauty": "Look
closer."</LD>
<LD>   Turan's review consists of four major arguments. First, that the
film's ad line, "Forget what you think you know," is misleading in
that the film presents no new information. Second, that the film's
Ali doesn't "give us any real sense of what he's thinking, of where
his actions come from." Third, that while Will Smith's performance is
"remarkable," the "character's overall aloofness is an odd choice for
one of the most across-the-board likable of leading men." Fourth,
that "the energy and hold-on-to-your-seat excitement that Muhammad
Ali brought to the sports world is oddly absent from this quite
accomplished but finally distant film."</LD>
<TE>   Mann's "Ali" presents a wealth of new information and revealing
moments and insights into one of the most written-about men in the
world. Mann takes you into the beginnings and ends of two of Ali's
marriages and the beginning of a third. The film examines those
private relationships as well as Ali's complex dealings with the
Nation of Islam and Malcolm X, and his off-camera relationships with
Howard Cosell and Drew "Bundini" Brown, his friend, spiritual
fireplug and one-man fan club.</TE>
<TE>   Mann accomplishes all this by making you see the world through
Ali's eyes as he experiences the adulation, scorn, celebration,
heartbreak, disgrace, defeat and ultimate triumph that was his life
and the life of a nation from 1964 to 1974--for while that time in
our nation's turbulent history defined Ali, Ali's life helped to
define a nation.</TE>
<TE>   Turan goes to some effort to backhand compliment the performance
Mann elicited from Smith. Turan first hails it as "remarkable," which
it no doubt is, but then expresses surprise that the character's
aloofness doesn't fit with Smith's heretofore seen strengths.</TE>
<TE>   There can be no question that Smith's portrayal of Ali features
only part of the perpetually cool Smith swagger and banter from "Men
in Black" and "Independence Day," for just as that is only one side
of Smith's abilities, so was Ali's fast-talking, lightening-witted
public persona only one side of the man.</TE>
<TE>   Those expecting only to see Smith spout clever, rhyming barbs to
the camera no doubt will be disappointed, for those are only part of
this epic film. But those wanting to know what Ali felt in the
moments that defined his life will get an Oscar-worthy tour in a
brilliantly detailed performance.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, Turan asserts that "Ali" the film does not live up to the
excitement of Ali the man. I respectfully disagree. The film portrays
the public and private moments of Ali's life--the decisions that
guide his life, the adversities he encounters and overcomes and, most
important, the manner in which he chooses to live his day-to-day
existence. As Mann has written, "Ali discovered who he wanted to be
and then made himself into that man."</TE>
<TE>   In Mann and Smith's collaboration, the result of that journey is
moving and inspiring and, ultimately, a film that will stand the test
of time as a record of a man's life and the period in which he lived
it.</TE>

<HD>One Last Song at the Shubert</HD>
<DH>As the wrecking ball arcs toward the theater, its onetime
denizens bid a farewell evocative of its opening show.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DON SHIRLEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES THEATER WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Brad Ellis looked out from the stage of the Shubert Theatre at a sea
of 2,100 empty seats that soon will be removed in preparation for the
theater's demolition, scheduled for November.</LD>
<LD>   "To be here tonight," Ellis said, "is like being in the show
'Follies.'"</LD>
<LD>   It was Saturday evening, as about 220 guests were arriving for the
Shubert's "wrecking ball party," a chance for people who worked at
the Century City theater to say farewell to the 30-year-old home of
many of L.A.'s longest-running shows. The Shubert, the adjacent
plaza, and the building south of the plaza will be replaced by new
office buildings.</LD>
<TE>   Ellis wasn't the only observer who compared the occasion to the
musical "Follies," which is set at a somewhat similar event in a
partially demolished New York theater--and which was the first show
to play the Shubert when it opened in 1972.</TE>
<TE>   "It's ironic that the first production here was set at a theater
that's being dismantled, and now we're going to do it for real," said
Milt King, 86, who was the Shubert's chief carpenter from its opening
until he retired two years ago.</TE>
<TE>   However, while the fictional "Follies" event involved a formal
program and bittersweet memories of personal affairs, the event at
the Shubert was decidedly casual and, more often than not, relatively
lighthearted.</TE>
<TE>   It was held nearly 11 months before the actual wrecking ball is
slated to arrive. The Shubert Organization, the New York-based
operator of the theater since it opened, chose to vacate the premises
by the end of January, in the absence of any bookings between now and
the end of the company's lease later in the year.</TE>
<TE>   Posters, programs, photos and other memorabilia of Shubert shows
were up for grabs in the lobbies, although posted notices asked
guests to limit themselves to three items, including no more than one
large wall piece.</TE>
<TE>   Inside the auditorium itself, the entertainment was provided by
Ellis, a veteran theatrical musical director, who sat at an upright
piano while guests gathered around him and sang show tunes. Ellis
himself had worked at the Shubert as a pit band pianist in the U.S.
premiere of "Ragtime," which opened in 1997 and became the theater's
last long-running show.</TE>
<TE>   Hanging out at the piano most of the evening was Ellis' wife,
Eydie Alyson, who acted in "Les Miserables" at the Shubert. She told
the story of how pranksters in the cast one night managed to tie her
to an onstage table with bandages, without her being aware of it, so
that when she started to move in the next scene, the table moved with
her. She had to furiously untie the knot in the shadows during the
"Bring Him Home" number.</TE>
<TE>   Nearby, actor Jason Graae peered up into the grids nearly 80 feet
above the stage. When he played the famous escape artist Harry
Houdini in "Ragtime," he made an entrance upside down, lowered from
the highest grid while clad in a straitjacket. Graae said he is
afraid of heights and didn't realize he would make such an entrance
when he took the role.</TE>
<TE>   Before he had to do the move for the first time, he consulted a
therapist, who advised him to have a picture taken of his first
descent--tangible proof that he could do it. It worked, and the job
turned into "a great gig, truly the best I ever had," Graae said. His
nerves even survived a performance in which he was hanging upside
down, awaiting his entrance, when a piece of scenery fell and injured
two other actors, causing audience members to scream and delaying the
show by a half hour.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, out in the lobby, former carpenter King recalled that
two people managed to bring their pet dogs into the theater, despite
the usual house rules against it: himself and Glenn Close, when she
was starring in "Sunset Boulevard." Close, he said, would sit on the
floor of her dressing room and eat supper, accompanied by her dog and
her children. King said his mixed terrier Foxy was in his office
"night and day," despite admonitions from security guards.</TE>
<TE>   A present-day security guard at the building, Jerome Shirley, who
was hired only seven months ago, said that long before he worked
there, he saw "Dreamgirls" at the Shubert--and it was the best of the
30 different productions of that show that he has seen. "I hate that
they're tearing this beautiful theater down," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Barbara Isley managed the Shubert box office from the beginning
until she was laid off a week ago. On the day in 1972 when the box
office opened for "Follies," a building inspector said the facilities
weren't ready yet. So she "became a ticket carhop for a day," selling
tickets to drivers who pulled up in front of the theater.</TE>
<TE>   Grace Melton, who worked in group ticket sales for the theater's
first three years, said she had to wear a hardhat during her first
days on the job, because construction hadn't been completed. The
Shubert wasn't an easy sell at the beginning, she said: "People
didn't know where Century City was."</TE>
<TE>   Only two Shubert employees remain on staff through the end of the
month: general manager Mark Nichols and assistant manager Jeff Loeb.
They are supervising the dispersal of the company's belongings.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   A few items are being sold. The rival Nederlander Organization is
buying the Shubert curtain for transfer to Hollywood's Pantages
Theatre, where the previous, well-worn curtain was discarded when
"The Lion King" opened. Nederlander is also buying some spotlights
for use at the Greek Theatre.</TE>
<TE>   But most of the theater's furnishings are being donated to
nonprofit theaters and service organizations. Center Theatre Group
will get 500 seats for use in its planned facility in Culver City.
Another 300 seats are going to the American Academy of Dramatic Arts.
Most of the rest of the seats are riser-mounted, not floor-mounted,
which means their use is more restricted, Nichols said. They will
probably be stored by L.A. Shares, an organization that handles
donations to local nonprofits.</TE>
<TE>   El Portal Center for the Arts in North Hollywood will receive five
rolls of unused carpet and a mezzanine bar. The 99-seat Evidence Room
will take home a variety of dressing room items, said artistic
director Bart DeLorenzo, who acknowledged, "I regret to say I never
saw a show at the Shubert. The tickets were very expensive."</TE>
<TE>   Standards of "expensive" have changed. Isley recalled that the
first ticket prices, in 1972, were $12.50 for musicals and $8.50 for
nonmusicals.</TE>
<TE>   Judi Davidson, publicist for many of the Shubert productions, said
that when Zero Mostel performed in "Fiddler on the Roof" at the
Shubert in 1976, "I had to beg to get him on Johnny Carson." After he
sang part of "If I Were a Rich Man" on Carson's TV show, he stopped
and said if the viewers wanted to hear the rest, they should call the
Shubert for tickets. "Phone lines at Shubert theaters across the
country lit up," Davidson said.</TE>
<TE>   Sheri Gottlieb worked as an usher at the Shubert from 1973 to
1975, then joined the concessions staff and became manager of

<HD>A Choreographer's Sweet 'Success' at 28</HD>
<DH>Dance* Christopher Wheeldon's new musical pegs him as the
next Jerome Robbins or George Balanchine, but just don't call him a
wunderkind.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SID SMITH</AU>
<BD>CHICAGO TRIBUNE</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>You've probably never heard of him, but you will. Christopher
Wheeldon, already something of a New York City darling, is poised to
boost his already impressive resume.</LD>
<LD>   He is now choreographing the new musical, "Sweet Smell of
Success," on pre-Broadway tryout at the Shubert Theatre in Chicago,
part of a team of giants that includes composer Marvin Hamlisch ("A
Chorus Line"), playwright John Guare ("Six Degrees of Separation"),
director Nicholas Hytner ("Miss Saigon") and set designer Bob Crowley
("Carousel").</LD>
<LD>   Wheeldon, whose day job happens to be that of resident
choreographer with the New York City Ballet, long home to George
Balanchine and Jerome Robbins, is all of 28.</LD>
<TE>   "Thank you for getting my age right," he says upfront. "I've been
given quite a range in articles all year, including 30, which was
truly horrifying."</TE>
<TE>   Yeah, horrifying. He's also over his natural role in the media as
a promising newcomer: "I'm constantly mentioned as Balanchine or
Robbins' successor, and it's getting tired. I've only been
choreographing for five years, for goodness' sake. And please don't
call me a wunderkind. That word now makes me shiver with horror."</TE>
<TE>   Fair enough. The non-wunderkind is nevertheless one of modern
choreography's most exciting success stories. "No ballet
choreographer of his generation can match his imaginative use of the
classical vocabulary," New York Times dance critic Anna Kisselgoff
pronounced in one review. His New York City Ballet boss, Peter
Martins, calls him a meteor.</TE>
<TE>   His comet-like rise began when he enrolled at age 7 in ballet
class in the tiny British village of East Coker. By 11, he'd made it
into the Royal Ballet School.</TE>
<TE>   "It's all very 'Billy Elliot,'" he says of the obvious analogy to
the movie's story. But, unlike the movie, his parents aren't working
class--his father's now a retired engineer and his mother a physical
therapist--nor are they opposed to his dancing.</TE>
<TE>   "I think they were relieved, frankly," he says. "I was pretty
hyperactive, and they were glad I had something that wore me out all
day and left me tired in the evenings."</TE>
<TE>   At age 18, he joined the corps of the Royal Ballet, but he spent
only two years there. "It was really accidental," he says of his
abrupt move to New York. "I had a lot of injuries, spraining my ankle
because of my flexible feet. After a jump, I'd forget to put my foot
down, and I'd twist the ankle."</TE>
<TE>   After one injury, he gave himself a trip to New York, where he was
well enough to take a class at New York City Ballet.</TE>
<TE>   "Peter Martins watched part of the class, and at the end of the
day, he called me in and invited me into the company. I hadn't seen
the Empire State Building or anything on my tourist's list, and yet I
left the New York State Theater that day with a job."</TE>
<TE>   Wheeldon had already choreographed a little and had caught the
attention of the Royal Ballet's Sir Kenneth MacMillan, who is now
deceased. At New York City Ballet, he told Martins he liked to
choreograph and fell under the influence of Robbins, who was still
alive when Wheeldon arrived in 1993. (Robbins died in 1998.) Robbins
cast him in his "Dances at a Gathering," for instance. "It was all
such a rigorous repertoire, sometimes three challenging ballets in an
evening. It's one of the reasons I took the job. I was tired of
skipping around maypoles so much in London full-lengths.</TE>
<TE>   "But at the end of my first season, I was thin and exhausted. I'd
never had to dance that much in my life."</TE>
<TE>   He worried constantly about his ankles, but the Balanchine
technique proved helpful in that regard: "I became stronger."</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Martins gradually broke him in as a dance maker,
through ballet school projects and workshops. He says his first big
breaks came with "Mercurial Maneuvers" and "Polyphonia" in the
1999-2000 New York City Ballet season.</TE>
<TE>   Last season, Martins named him the company's first resident
choreographer (for at least the next five years, he says), and he
created "Variations Serieuses," a slapstick ballet with a "42nd
Street" scenario and a "Noises Off"-like set showing the dancers on
and offstage.</TE>
<TE>   "What's fantastic is that I'm getting to go all over the place,
work with different companies, and still have a home with the company
in New York," says Wheeldon, who has pretty much given up dancing for
now. "And I can work on a Broadway musical."</TE>
<TE>   That came about when he choreographed a short piece for Hytner's
movie, "Center Stage," about the New York ballet world. "He called
last spring and invited me to the summer workshop planned for 'Sweet
Smell.' He warned me it was just a tryout and that I might not wind
up with the job."</TE>
<TE>   But Wheeldon arrived with his own intense beliefs about the show,
inspired by the very dark, brooding 1957 black-and-white original
movie--not something associated with dancing. Still, whatever the
critical fate of the show overall, Wheeldon provides choreography
both youthful and smart.</TE>
<TE>   He uses his dancers as deliciously lively, retro-ballroom revelers
in the show's nightclub scenes, the women throwing their legs around
their partners with swing abandon. Elsewhere, they're a haunting,
shadowy Greek chorus, and sometimes the two modes come together. In
one startling move, a dancer in rhumbalike fury falls to the floor
and rolls speedily to the front of the stage, where she's quickly
covered with a cloak, transformed in a flash into a corpse for a
suicide subplot.</TE>
<TE>   "From the beginning, I stressed that I may be young and
inexperienced, but I am a choreographer. If there was to be dance, it
had to be dance. I wasn't just going to be a people mover. And Nick
[Hytner] agreed. The challenge was to find how the dance fits into
the show as plot-forwarding, not just as 'Six-seven-eight, let's
dance,'" echoing what many regard as his mentor Robbins' greatest
contribution to Broadway dance via his plot-driven choreography for
"West Side Story."</TE>
<TE>   Even John Lithgow, who stars in the show as a Walter Winchell-like
columnist, dances.</TE>
<TE>   "He's the best," Wheeldon says. "He believes in repetition and
practice, and when I threw in just a few extra steps into this
vaudeville dance he does near the end, he said a couple of hundred
more times and I'll get it. He means it."</TE>
<TE>   Wheeldon's generation is not known for its balletomania. "I'd love
to encourage as many young people as possible to come to the ballet,
but I'm not going to sell out by doing what I call soulless
techno-dance. I've seen too many sucked into that pseudo-style."</TE>
<TE>   "Sweet Smell" attracted him because of its thoughtfulness.</TE>
<TE>   "Some people ask if it's too dark, given our serious situation
right now," Wheeldon says. "I think the opposite. People are anxious
to live and learn as much as they can, to be stimulated and not to be
talked down to. They want to be challenged. Who knows how far we're
going down the road? Who knows how much longer we all have to live?"</TE>

<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When I got the call from the USO asking if I would be interested in
going to the Middle East to visit American troops stationed there, I
felt the sense of a circle completed. Thirty years before, I had been
a teenage Marine in Vietnam anxious for the break from routine and
patrols that a USO show always meant.</LD>
<LD>   Those shows, of course, offered us a view of the famous, or, as in
the case of the "Gold Diggers," the beautiful. But most of all it
reminded us of home and some of the things special about the States.
Now here it was 2001 and another war halfway around the world
required another generation to be entertained by the shows and people
provided to the military by the USO.</LD>
<LD>   I wasn't expected to put on a show. The USO had the idea of a
handshake tour--greet the troops, sign autographs and have pictures
taken. These were, they explained, young men and women who had grown
up watching "Days of Our Lives." After nearly 19 years on the NBC
show, I had gotten used to being told, "I grew up watching you." The
other celebrity on our handshake tour would be the rapper Coolio. He
was a veteran, having spent Thanksgiving entertaining the troops
along the DMZ in Korea.</LD>
<TE>   The USO told us we would not know where we were going until just
before our departure day. I was given several choices of dates and
decided that the Christmas holidays would be the best time.</TE>
<TE>   My son, Jed, a college senior, was able to accompany me and agreed
to be my photographer and assistant. It would turn out that he would
be a bigger attraction to some of the female soldiers than Coolio and
I. We were both ready for what the USO promised would be a
life-altering experience.</TE>
<TE>   Twenty-three hours after leaving Los Angeles, our British Airways
plane touched down at the Kuwait City airport. It was 6 a.m. in
Kuwait and my wife was just going to dinner with friends in L.A.
While her day was ending, ours was just beginning.</TE>
<TE>   Our first stop was Camp Doha, the largest of the American bases in
Kuwait. One of the first things we noticed was the security--concrete
barriers and automatic steel gates creating a formidable obstacle
course to the entrance of every place we visited. Stone-faced young
men in full combat gear met us at each entrance and checked our
security badges. Finally, we were asked to get out of our vehicle
while dogs and bomb detectors swept over it and our possessions.</TE>
<TE>   Inside the recreation hall at Camp Doha, we were led to a stage
and got a warm greeting from a couple of hundred soldiers, Marines
and airmen. Sprinkled about the crowd were a few British and
Australians. After being presented with a personalized bush hat,
Coolio and I sat at a table provided and began signing autographs and
posing for pictures. The line curved around the recreation hall and
never seemed to diminish. For three hours we signed, posed and
talked--about home and the holidays.</TE>
<TE>   I looked at each soldier's face as I asked their name and where
they were from. So often looking back at me was a teenager younger
than my own son.</TE>
<TE>   Frequently a young woman in fatigues and toting a rifle would tell
me how her mother had taught her to love "Days of Our Lives." An
officer would mention he liked the way I stood up to Stephano (the
archvillain of the show).</TE>
<TE>   One sergeant told me his wife e-mails him the plots of each
episode. I signed hats and shirts. One young man quietly asked if I
could give him romantic advice. He knew I would have the perfect gift
for his wife. I suggested poetry.</TE>
<TE>   No End Date for Kuwait Stays</TE>
<TE>   Camp Doha was the first time we realized that many of the young
men and women have no idea how long they will be staying in Kuwait.
Most have no end date for their assignments. Some know that they will
leave in the spring. One unit from the Big Red One at Ft. Riley,
Kan., had just returned to Kuwait after going home at the end of
August and thinking they had seen the last of the desert.</TE>
<TE>   Being homesick was universal among the American troops there.
Almost every one of the men and women mentioned how much they missed
home or a loved one. They talked of going home--whenever that would
be.</TE>
<TE>   Having watched "Days of Our Lives" for years with mothers,
girlfriends, fathers and brothers, many of the soldiers intended to
use Coolio's and my autographed photos as Christmas presents. Because
of Ramadan, Americans were locked down on their bases, so gift
shopping was limited to the PX.</TE>
<TE>   The pairing of the soap actor and the rapper on this trip did not
look to be inspired thinking at first. But it turned out to be a
perfect blend. I found Coolio to be an extremely pleasant and
talented man who is instantly likable. About 10 minutes with Coolio
would dissipate any stereotype about rappers. He is a voracious
reader who was comfortable discussing religion, philosophy,
literature and many other subjects while we moved from outpost to
outpost.</TE>
<TE>   While the young soldiers danced and rapped along with Coolio, they
asked me about story line, told me how much they liked my character
of (police commander) Abe Carver, and wondered how I could remember
all those lines. They didn't care that Coolio and I came from two
diverse parts of the entertainment world. They only cared that we
were there to see them and remind them of home.</TE>
<TE>   Since this was not an entertainment tour, Coolio had no band and
backup singers. But at each stop our USO and WMR (Welfare, Morale and
Recreation) representatives would set up a portable amp, and Coolio
would perform a couple of his songs. "Sunshine" is a new tune, a rap
ballad that Coolio wrote after Sept. 11 to affirm the positive side
of life. It is a sweet, infectious song as sunny as its title.</TE>
<TE>   As an Islamic country, Kuwait is moderately conservative. Women do
not have the vote, but some wear Western dress. Americans in uniform
are confined to their bases during Ramadan to not inadvertently
offend religious sensibilities. We arrived at the beginning of Eid,
which is the celebratory end of Ramadan. The GIs would soon be
allowed to go into Kuwait City, but only in civilian clothes.</TE>
<TE>   The soldiers in the desert cabals will not see Kuwait City at
anytime. They are flown into the country, and their only view of
Kuwait is the vast, empty desert border area facing Iraq. A cabal is
nothing more than a dirt fortress carved out of the desert sand and
named after U.S. states, in this case New York, Pennsylvania and
Virginia, which were involved in the Sept. 11 attacks. Inside the
berms of each cabal are Americans carrying M-16s and M-4s. These are
the troops looking directly at Sadam Hussein's Iraq. They are the
troops ready to meet another Iraqi attempt to annex Kuwait.</TE>
<TE>   The men and women at the cabals may have been the happiest to see
us. At first we were greeted with a stunned silence. But with the
realization that we were actually with them in the desert strongholds
came smiles, laughter and excited requests for pictures and
autographs.</TE>
<TE>   In this place, which could be instantly at war, weapons must be
carried everywhere: the bathroom, the workout tent, mess hall, and,
yes, to bed. Yet the morale was extremely high. Even with
Thanksgiving past and Christmas within a few days, these young people
exhibited very little melancholy. They would rather be home for the
holidays, but this was their job and they were ready to do it.</TE>
<TE>   A Reunion With the Marine Corps</TE>
<TE>   I spent my last day with the Marines. This was special for me. It
had been a long time since I had been with a Marine Corps combat
outfit. These were all Marines from Camp Pendleton. We talked of
familiar places in Southern California. I noticed that the creases on
their uniforms were still sharp.</TE>
<TE>   Some were cleaning weapons. But they all stopped and crowded
around when I walked in. Just like fans everywhere, they asked what
Abe was going to do with the growing bad side of his wife, Lexie. Did
I know the baby wasn't really ours? Who is the nicest person on the
show?</TE>
<TE>   But they also let it be known how grateful they were for our
visit. No one comes to see us, they say. They all go to Germany or
Turkey or Saudi.</TE>
<TE>   I was glad to have come to see them, to tell them how proud the
folks back home were for their service. I would be back, I promised.
Not to repay an old debt of another war, but to show my appreciation
for America's new warriors.</TE>

<LD>NBC's "Fear Factor" returns for its second season tonight at 8 with
its squirmability quotient still unquestionably potent.</LD>
<LD>   A son-of-"Survivor" clone that distills that CBS show down to its
immunity-challenge essence, "Fear" was a surprise hit in its own
right last summer. The premise of having six young, attractive
adults--three men and three women--vie each week for a $50,000 payoff
by engaging in stuntman derring-do and gross-out encounters with our
friends from the animal kingdom evidently struck a chord with
viewers.</LD>
<LD>   Or struck something.</LD>
<TE>   The show, ably hosted by comedian Joe Rogan, helps familiarize us
with contestants by offering some bio info and brief interview
segments. But unlike "Survivor," which has weeks and weeks to let its
cast's foibles burrow their way into your consciousness, "Fear
Factor" has only an hour, and new contestants each episode.</TE>
<TE>   What personality does come out is usually displayed while
trash-talking the competition during the three stunts.</TE>
<TE>   Tonight's show opens with the contestants scrambling along the
wing of a 1941 biplane as it cruises 3,000 feet above the desert
floor at 100 mph. The closing stunt involves sending a car careening
off a parking structure onto stacks of cardboard boxes three stories
below.</TE>
<TE>   But it's the centerpiece segment that will be water-cooler fodder
the next day at the office. The setup: A small fish tank is filled
with water, and a couple of dozen plums are placed in it. But before
the contestants are asked to go bobbing for fruit, 50 slim,
slithering water snakes are added to the mix. Fifty-one if you count
the ball python.</TE>
<TE>   Has a TV show's "don't try this at home" disclaimer ever been more
unnecessary?</TE>

<LD>   The relic, now displayed at a museum in Delphi, was discovered in
1939 in a 5th century BC trash dump near where the fabled oracle sat
in ancient times.</LD>
<LD>   DeVries said growing evidence suggests the statuette came from
ancient Anatolia, now central Turkey. The statuette has some of the
same decorative and physical features as sculptures unearthed at
archeological sites in that region that are yielding finds from the
ancient kingdom of Phrygia. The features include unusually large
eyes, a large head, a small torso and long legs.</LD>

<LD>Utah researchers have discovered a gene that controls grooming in
mice. When the gene is disabled, the team reported in the January
issue of Neuron, the mice obsessively nibble and lick their fur until
they grow bald and scarred. The gene, called Hoxb8, is one of a
family that controls embryonic development. Researchers speculate
that malfunctions in similar genes in humans could be responsible for
obsessive-compulsive behavior, such as repeated hand-washing.</LD>

<LD>Mayo Clinic researchers have developed an instant "lie detector"
technique that picks up mini hot flushes around the eyes and could
lead to such tests becoming standard at airport check-ins.</LD>
<LD>   The team reported in the Jan. 3 issue of Nature that it used a
high-definition thermal-imaging camera to scan faces to see if people
blush when answering a question. In theory, blood should rush to the
eye area of most people who are lying, researcher James Levine said,
while the innocent remain coolly and calmly unaffected. Experiments
in which 20 people were randomly asked to stab a mannequin, rob it of
$20 and then profess their innocence showed the technique to be as
effective as existing polygraph tests. Of course, just as polygraphs
can be fooled, so too can this technique. In tests, the thermal
camera correctly picked out 75% of the guilty individuals and 90% of
the innocent, a control group that had no knowledge of the mock
crime.</LD>

<LD>Most contain carbamide peroxide, which combines with moisture in the
mouth to lighten teeth much as peroxide bleaches hair. Dentists use a
concentrated bleach that contains 30% to 35% carbamide peroxide
applied for 30 to 60 minutes. Its activity may be enhanced with heat
or light. Home kits contain a less-concentrated form, about 10% to
15% carbamide peroxide, that is applied at night for two weeks. The
most common side effect is that bleaching makes teeth more sensitive
to heat and cold, but that effect subsides with time.</LD>

<HD>The Answers That Are Blowing in the Wind</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>K.C. Cole</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Sometimes I sit and watch the wind have its way with the tree outside
my house, blowing the leaves into billowy curtains, making them
shimmer like sequins on a dance dress.</LD>
<LD>   Of course, you can't see wind. You can only see what it does to
things: twirling scraps of garbage into miniature tornadoes; slinking
through flags or snapping them to attention; fashioning coiffures of
clouds.</LD>
<LD>   We think of wind as something that happens on our home planet: the
trade winds that wrap the Earth in swift ribbons, the jet stream, the
Santa Anas.</LD>
<TE>   But the universe as a whole is a remarkably windy place.</TE>
<TE>   Jupiter's fierce winds sheer against each other as they
shift along with latitude, setting up huge standing hurricanes, some
the size of Earth. These storms are visible as red and white oval
"spots." The hot winds of Venus blow at hundreds of miles per hour.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Even gentle Mars has winds strong enough to stir up tiny dust
devils on the planet's surface.</TE>
<TE>   There is complicated "weather" in galaxies too, writes British
astronomer Sir Martin Rees, "churning up the interstellar gas and
recycling it through successive generations of stars--this is how the
atoms from the periodic table are built up from pristine hydrogen."</TE>
<TE>   The winds of stars create the atoms that comprise ourselves.</TE>
<TE>   Tightly packed clusters of stars are particularly windy; so many
stars in close quarters engage in a fierce gravitational tug of war,
ripping gas off each other's atmospheres.</TE>
<TE>   Some stars are so luminous that they literally blow their tops,
the pressure of light lifting off layers of atmosphere so rapidly
that the star loses the mass of Earth every few days. Live fast, die
young.</TE>
<TE>   When stars explode, escaping winds can travel at 1/10th the speed
of light, 20 to 30 thousand miles per second. Indeed, the winds of
dying stars create some of the most beautiful objects in the sky:
planetary nebulae. When the fast winds from the stellar explosion
plow into slow winds lingering from the star's previous exhalations,
they drape the star's spent cinder in bulbous glowing shrouds.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Our own sun will one day take its place among this photogenic
assemblage. For now, it has its own, albeit tamer, electrically
charged wind, sometimes slung toward the Earth by powerful magnetic
fields. Descending at Earth's north and south poles, the winds light
up the sky in ghostly pink and green auroras.</TE>
<TE>   Scientists can use winds to extract information from nature. After
all, a wind is caused by a pressure gradient that makes particles of
matter move from one place to another, which is why you can create
"wind" by sucking through a straw or blowing through a flute.</TE>
<TE>   Conversely, the detection of wind points to the existence of a
difference. Thus, it was the lack of a detectable "ether wind" that
helped bury the long-cherished idea that an invisible light-carrying
substance pervaded all space. Since Earth moved through the ether,
scientists reasoned, it must set up a "wind" as it plowed through.
But no wind was ever found.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Today, physicists searching for dark matter are doing much the
same experiment, only searching for the WIMP wind. WIMPs (weakly
interacting massive particles) are a hypothetical species of dark
matter, attracted to our galaxy like moths to a flame but so
ephemeral they are all but impossible to perceive other than through
gravity. However, as Earth-bound detectors move through this cloud of
WIMPs, they should feel an ever-so-slight (you might say wimpy)
breeze.</TE>
<TE>   Once you start thinking of wind as matter in motion, you can see
it almost anywhere. A galaxy is a spiral "wind" of stars; smoke going
up a chimney a sinuous wind of soot; matter falling into a black hole
a wind that goes one way.</TE>
<TE>   The universe began when the Big Bang blew space and time
into being; that wind of ever-expanding space still blows, sweeping
distant galaxies farther away from us, maybe even picking up speed.</TE>
<TE>   There are winds so slow we barely perceive them: the aroma rising
from roast beef (a "wind" of food), glaciers (a "wind" of ice).</TE>
<TE>   Others are buried out of sight: the whoosh of hot
mineral-rich smoke jetting out of deep undersea vents; the wind of
blood that blows through your heart.</TE>
<TE>   Living things make all kinds of wind--breathing, singing, crying,
barking, tweeting. Bad breath is a foul wind. Whispers are winds from
the heart.</TE>
<TE>   Crowds funneling through a doorway make a "wind" of people.
Traffic zooming along the freeway makes a "wind" of cars. All winds
collide.</TE>
<TE>   Winds also carry things with them: smells, secrets, radioactive
fallout.</TE>
<TE>   I read somewhere that after the World Trade Center attacks, debris
traveled in the form of powder up the streets of Manhattan at 50
miles per hour--a wind of concrete and souls.</TE>
<TE>   That windchill factor froze me to the bone.</TE>

<HD>The Great White's Ways</HD>
<DH>Research reveals new details about the sharks' behavior,
including their travel plans. Apparently, many winter in Hawaii.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KENNETH R. WEISS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Scientists have long thought that California's great white sharks
spent their lives patrolling the chilly waters off the central coast,
venturing only as far as Southern California to breed and deliver
their young.</LD>
<LD>   Nothing, it seemed, could coax these relative homebodies to stray
far from their coastal hunting grounds, where they love nothing more
than making a quick meal of blubbery seals and sea lions.</LD>
<LD>   Now new research has shattered the image of the hardened predator
with the photogenic jaws.</LD>
<TE>   Apparently they are world travelers enjoying a softer, more
cosmopolitan lifestyle that includes spending the winter in Hawaii or
other tropical waters.</TE>
<TE>   A team of California researchers announced that discovery last
week in the journal Nature after performing the tricky task of
attaching electronic tags to a half-dozen sharks as they surfaced for
a feeding frenzy.</TE>
<TE>   These sophisticated Pop-up Satellite Archival Tags, which record
light, sea temperature and pressure every two minutes for up to a
year, were key to the new understanding of sharks. The same
technology, researchers say, can be used for deciphering the
movements of numerous sea creatures, resolving a major difficulty in
ocean research.</TE>
<TE>   "The open ocean is almost a complete unknown," said Barbara Block,
a marine physiologist at Stanford University. "It's much harder to
track one of these animals in the ocean than, say, track a tiger on
land."</TE>
<TE>   The 6-inch tags stay on the animal until a preset date, when a
tiny computer activates a battery to release an electric current. The
electricity, combined with salt water, rapidly corrodes the thin
metal that holds the tag to the fish, allowing it to break free and
pop to the surface. Once there, the tag transmits data to a computer
via satellite. The data describe an animal's location from moment to
moment for the months it was tagged with an accuracy of about 10
kilometers.</TE>
<TE>   In the case of the sharks, one tag surfaced just south of Maui,
revealing that the creature had been hanging out there for four
months. Other tags popped up in the open ocean, halfway between the
tip of Baja and Hawaii.</TE>
<TE>   Not only did the data reveal migrations far from shore, the
information from the tags showed researchers that the sharks can
spend considerable time in the open ocean, far from any coast, and
can dive to almost half a mile below the surface.</TE>
<TE>   "The results surprised all of us," Block said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Tuna Tagged First</TE>
<TE>   The tagging technology was pioneered in 1997 to track bluefin
tuna, the ocean's most valuable fish. A single fish, its red flesh
revered in sushi bars, routinely fetches $30,000 or more at auction
in Tokyo.</TE>
<TE>   In the Atlantic Ocean, authorities have worried that bluefin are
vanishing. International officials have imposed quotas on what U.S.
and Canadian fishermen can pull from the American side of the
Atlantic. Europeans and the Japanese, meanwhile, continue to harvest
bluefin with far fewer restrictions from the eastern Atlantic.</TE>
<TE>   Block and her colleagues, after tagging hundreds of these fish,
created a political splash recently by showing that the fish swam
freely from one side of the Atlantic to the other. Their findings
undermined the notion that the adult tuna of the eastern and western
Atlantic constitute two wholly separate populations. That, in turn,
raised questions about the wisdom of different rules for catching
tuna in different parts of the same ocean.</TE>
<TE>   Now these researchers at the Tuna Research and Conservation
Center, a joint project of Stanford and the Monterey Bay Aquarium,
are expanding use of the technology to different types of fish to
unravel mysteries of the deep.</TE>
<TE>   Teaming up with biologists at the Farallon and Ano Nuevo islands,
off the coast near San Francisco, they focused on one of the most
enthralling but least understood creatures: the great white shark.</TE>
<TE>   Yet tagging the world's largest predatory fish, which can reach 21
feet in length and weigh 4,800 pounds, is a bit more dicey than
labeling a tuna.</TE>
<TE>   In the case of tuna, researchers found they could hoist the fish
aboard ship, cover its eyes with a wet chamois and pump seawater into
its mouth to calm it while the tag was affixed.</TE>
<TE>   The great white shark, which inspired the movie "Jaws," is known
to be less cooperative.</TE>
<TE>   "It would be logistically difficult to catch and release one,"
said Peter Pyle, a Farallones' biologist who has studied great white
sharks for more than a decade.</TE>
<TE>   Pyle and independent researcher Scot Anderson have spent years
studying sharks near the islands--racing their small boat toward
slicks of blubber oil and blood left over from an attack on an
elephant seal or sea lion.</TE>
<TE>   With cameras mounted on poles, they have identified many sharks,
noticing that females seem to show up around the islands every other
year. Sharks of both genders seem to depart in late December, their
destination unknown.</TE>
<TE>   The two eagerly invited Andre M. Boustany, one of Block's Stanford
doctoral students and lead author of the Nature article, to join them
on their 17-foot Boston whaler and help implant electronic tags in
the sharks circling below.</TE>
<TE>   The researchers used an 8-foot pole mounted with a barbed titanium
dart, which was connected by a metal leader to the cylindrical
electronic tag.</TE>
<TE>   "The gunwales are mid-calf, so there's not a lot holding you in
the boat," Boustany said. The sharks are "14 to 18 feet long, pretty
intimidating at first."</TE>
<TE>   The researchers set the first tags to release after only a few
weeks to provide evidence that the technology worked without
disturbing the sharks.</TE>
<TE>   Tags on four other sharks were set to release after four or six
months.</TE>
<TE>   When the releases came, they revealed behavior never before
recorded in a great white shark.</TE>
<TE>   One large male, nicknamed Tipfin, took about 40 days to make the
2,280-mile trip to the Hawaiian island of Kahoolawe, just south of
Maui, averaging 43 miles a day.</TE>
<TE>   He remained there basking in the 79-degree water all winter and
spring. Tipfin returned to the chilly 50 to 57 degree water around
the Farallones this November, where he was implanted with a
nine-month tag.</TE>
<TE>   The three others, two females and a male, migrated to a warm-water
area of the Pacific hundreds of miles west of the tip of Baja
California. They remained for months, never venturing near any
coastline.</TE>
<TE>   "Going into this, we expected white sharks to be coastal animals,
feeding on seals," said Burney J. Le Boeuf, a biologist at UC Santa
Cruz. The sharks also were thought to be shallow swimmers, living in
the top 90 feet or so of water.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Fast Track to Hawaii</TE>
<TE>   But the results not only showed the sharks spending as much as
five months a year in the open ocean, they also revealed dives of up
to 2,000 feet below the surface.</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, during their migration the sharks tended to swim either
near the surface or at depths of 900 to 1,500 feet. That prompted
speculation that they might have found favorable currents, sort of a
Hawaii express, to help them cover the distance more efficiently.</TE>
<TE>   Some biologists hypothesize that great whites, one of only a few
warmblooded shark species that carry their young until birth, head
toward the tropics for breeding.</TE>
<TE>   Others suggest they may be looking for different kinds of prey.
Most acknowledge they don't really know.</TE>
<TE>   "All this leads us to the larger question: What are they doing
over there?" said Le Boeuf, an animal behavior expert who is studying
sharks with Scott Davis, a doctoral student.</TE>
<TE>   "I guess they like to ease up a little bit, like we do."</TE>

<HD>Lawmakers Urge Rejection of Satellite TV Deal</HD>
<DH>Television: Western House members say the proposed
EchoStar- DirecTV merger would hurt rural constituents.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBERT GEHRKE</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>A group of Western lawmakers is urging the Federal Communications
Commission and the Justice Department to reject a proposed merger
between two satellite television giants, arguing that the deal would
hurt their rural constituents.</LD>
<LD>   By reducing the number of providers, the proposed $26-billion
merger of EchoStar Communications Corp. and DirecTV would put rural
subscribers--who can't subscribe to cable because lines have not been
laid there--at the mercy of a monopoly and drive up prices, 15
Western House members wrote in a letter Friday.</LD>
<LD>   "In the EchoStar-DirecTV case, the result for rural America will
be a monopoly with essentially no hope of future entrants in the
marketplace," the  legislators said in their letter to Atty. Gen.
John Ashcroft and FCC Chairman Michael Powell.</LD>
<TE>   Ashcroft and Powell have to give their blessings to the merger for
it to occur. A decision is expected by midyear.</TE>
<TE>   Rep. Chris Cannon (R-Utah), vice chairman of the Western Caucus,
said he was astonished that the two companies would push such a
flawed merger.</TE>
<TE>   "It is hard to imagine a more clear-cut example of a merger that
violates our competition laws," Cannon said.</TE>
<TE>   "This merger as proposed is unthinkable and it should not take the
Justice Department and FCC much time to deny it."</TE>
<TE>   Judianne Atencio, spokeswoman for Littleton, Colo.-based EchoStar,
said the merger would help bring rural America high-speed satellite
Internet, high-definition television stations and interactive
distance learning programs they can't get now.</TE>
<TE>   "We believe that once government officials and some of these rural
special-interest groups really examine some of the issues surrounding
this merger, they'll not only approve of it but extol it to others
because of the many benefits that the combined company can offer to
consumers," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Atencio also said the national pricing plan that is part of the
merger would ensure that rural subscribers don't pay more than their
urban counterparts.</TE>
<TE>   EchoStar, which runs the Dish Network, said in October that it
planned to buy Hughes Electronics Corp., the El Segundo-based parent
of DirecTV.</TE>
<TE>   DirecTV is the largest satellite TV operator, with 10.3 million
subscribers. At the time the deal was valued at $26 billion.</TE>
<TE>   If the deal goes through, EchoStar will control about 90% of the
U.S. digital satellite TV market and have about 17 million
subscribers--more than AT&amp;T Corp., the nation's leading cable TV
provider.</TE>
<TE>   The House members said such a monopolized market would not offer
any incentive to innovate or meet consumer needs.</TE>
<TE>   The letter was signed by 16 lawmakers, including Reps. Randy
"Duke" Cunningham (R-San Diego), Howard P. "Buck" McKeon (R-Santa
Clarita), Richard W. Pombo (R-Tracy) and Wally Herger (R-Marysville).</TE>
<TE>   Shares of Hughes Electronics tracking stock rose 1 cent to $16.26
on the New York Stock Exchange on Friday. EchoStar shares climbed 10
cents to $28.59 on Nasdaq.</TE>

<HD>Intel, Advanced Micro Unveil New Processors</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Intel Corp. and Advanced Micro Devices Inc. today are launching the
fastest models yet of their flagship processors, the electronic
brains of personal computers.</LD>
<LD>   Intel's new top Pentium 4 chips run at 2.2 gigahertz and 2 GHz, or
2.2 billion and 2 billion of cycles per second. AMD's latest, the
Athlon XP 2000+, clocks in at 1.67 GHz.</LD>
<LD>   Despite the speed difference, AMD has claimed its Athlons have
more efficient architecture and perform better than faster Intel
chips running the most popular applications.</LD>
<TE>   But Intel's new chips are the first to be built using a process
that allows smaller transistors and other features, doubled on-board
memory and a 30% reduction in overall processor size.</TE>
<TE>   The result is a roughly 10% performance boost beyond the gain from
bumping up the processor speed, said Louis Burns, general manager of
Intel's Desktop Platform Group.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts also expect the new process technology to help Intel meet
demand for the Pentium 4 as well as improve profit margins by
increasing the number of chips from each silicon wafer.</TE>
<TE>   Intel's previous top chip was the 2-GHz Pentium 4, which was
introduced in August. It was built using the older process
technology.</TE>
<TE>   The 2.2-GHz Pentium 4 will cost $562 when purchased in volumes of
1,000. The new 2-GHz chip is priced at $364. The Athlon XP 2000+
costs $339.</TE>

<HD>Bush to Meet With Greenspan Today</HD>

<BD>Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>President Bush will meet with Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan
today and also with his team of economic advisors, a White House
spokesman said.</LD>
<LD>   The president and Greenspan meet periodically to discuss the state
of the economy. Today's meeting is the first reported since they had
lunch together Dec. 3.</LD>
<LD>   Greenspan will make his first speeches of the year this week,
including one Friday on the economy to a San Francisco public policy
group.</LD>
<TE>   He also will discuss financial literacy at an economic summit in
Oakland on Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   The economy fell into recession in March and gross domestic
product contracted at a 1.3% annual rate in the third quarter.</TE>
<TE>   GDP probably shrank again at a 1.4% pace in the final three months
of last year, according to a Bloomberg News survey.</TE>
<TE>   The Fed has lowered the benchmark overnight bank lending rate 11
times since the beginning of 2001 to a 40-year low of 1.75% to give
the economy a boost.</TE>
<TE>   Greenspan last spoke at length on the U.S. economy Oct. 19 when he
told the National Italian American Foundation that the country faced
an "uneven" recovery from the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.</TE>
<TE>   The Fed's policy-setting Open Market Committee next convenes to
discuss interest rates Jan. 29 and 30. Investors are betting that the
Fed has halted its series of reductions and that rates may start to
rise by midyear.</TE>

<HD>McGlashan Appointed CEO of Critical Path</HD>

<BD>Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Critical Path Inc. is expected to announce today that William
McGlashan was made chief executive of the once-troubled provider of
Internet messaging infrastructure after serving in that role on an
interim basis since October.</LD>
<LD>   McGlashan, 38, has been credited with helping turn the company
around.</LD>
<LD>   He most recently was a partner at venture capital firm Whitney &amp;
Co. and chief executive of Vectis Group, a Whitney-funded technology
investment firm.</LD>
<TE>   Before becoming Critical Path's interim chief executive, McGlashan
was part of the team charged early last year with turning around the
San Francisco-based company.</TE>
<TE>   Critical Path started 2001 by posting a surprisingly large loss
and revealed that its 2000 revenue had been inflated.</TE>
<TE>   McGlashan and other company executives have since restructured its
burdensome debt, slashed expenses, shed assets, acquired new funding,
settled shareholder lawsuits and refocused the business.</TE>
<TE>   Critical Path's shares--which tumbled from an all-time high of
more than $150 to an all-time low of 24 cents--finished Friday's
regular trading session at $3.80 on Nasdaq.</TE>

<BD>Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>AOL Time Warner Inc., the biggest media and Internet company, is
expected to revise its 2002 revenue and profit forecasts today as
advertising slumps and subscriber growth at its America Online unit
slows, analysts said.</LD>
<LD>   The New York-based company is coping with lower advertising sales
at units such as magazines, cable TV networks and America Online,
where third-quarter ad sales fell 12% from the previous quarter.</LD>
<LD>   Shares of AOL Time Warner rose 37 cents Friday to close at $31.95
on the New York Stock Exchange. The stock fell 7.8% last year.</LD>
<TE>   AOL Time Warner may trim 2002 forecasts for "double-digit"
percentage growth in cash flow, or earnings before interest, taxes,
depreciation, amortization and other expenses, analysts said.</TE>
<TE>   Co-Chief Operating Officer Richard Parsons, who becomes chief
executive in May, is taking over a company that in September lowered
its 2001 cash-flow and revenue forecasts.</TE>
<TE>   "It certainly wasn't an 'A' year," said Youssef Squali, an analyst
at FAC/Equities in New York, who has a "buy" rating on the stock and
doesn't own shares.</TE>
<TE>   "Part of their problem was their goals were too aggressive, and
the economy didn't perform as well as people expected two years ago,"
Squali said.</TE>

<HD>Japan May Be Ready to Form Trade Group</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Japanese government may be set to begin drafting an action plan
to push for the signing of a comprehensive economic cooperation
accord with Southeast Asian nations, including a free-trade
agreement.</LD>
<LD>   The development appears to be at least partly in response to a
recent agreement between China and the Assn. of Southeast Asian
Nations for a free-trade area within 10 years, action that prompted
speculation that Japan may be losing Asian influence to its giant
neighbor.</LD>
<LD>   The plan would aim at concluding the economic accord within five
to 10 years, according to government sources quoted by the newspaper
Yomiuri Shimbun.</LD>
<TE>   Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi departs on a whirlwind
tour of five ASEAN countriesWednesday, and he is expected to propose
to their leaders that work on the action plan begin as early as the
end of January.</TE>
<TE>   The sources were quoted as saying that Japan hopes to win official
approval for the plan at a Japan-ASEAN summit meeting scheduled to be
held in Cambodia next autumn.</TE>
<TE>   The action plan is expected to specify what areas the accord will
cover, as well as lay down a timetable of negotiations, the Yomiuri
said.</TE>
<TE>   Japan also is hoping to include provisions to improve the
investment environment between Tokyo and ASEAN as well as agreements
on energy security and intellectual property rights.</TE>
<TE>   Japan has been reluctant to embrace such a plan, which is likely
to run into strong resistance from areas such as the nation's
protected agriculture sector in the face of a possible flood of cheap
Asian imports.</TE>
<TE>   It has concluded only one free trade agreement, with Singapore, as
the core of an accord signed in October.</TE>

<HD>Enron Creditors Want Case Moved to Houston</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A group of Enron Corp. creditors will try to persuade a New York
bankruptcy judge today to move the case to a court in Houston, where
the energy company is based.</LD>
<LD>   Large creditors, such as energy traders Dynegy Inc. and El Paso
Corp., and smaller ones, such as the Southern Ute Indian Tribe of
Colorado, believe it would be more convenient and economical to hear
the case near the location of many of Enron creditors and assets.
Dynegy and El Paso are based in Houston.</LD>
<LD>   In a motion filed by Dynegy and other creditors, lawyers also say
there is "an emotional interest to be served" by moving the case to
Houston, where thousands of Enron employees were laid off and many
more witnessed the rapid evaporation of their retirement plans when
the company's stock plummeted.</LD>
<TE>   Analysts say these creditors might also be hoping for a
potentially more favorable hearing in Houston, where the economy has
suffered as a result of Enron's demise.</TE>
<TE>   Lawyers for Enron, and a handful of creditors opposed to
relocating the proceedings, are expected to argue that it would be
less expensive and more accommodating if the case were administered
in New York, home to the armies of lawyers and bankers working on
both sides.</TE>
<TE>   Howard B. Comet, an attorney for Weil, Gotshal &amp; Manges in New
York, said it also would be easier for business partners and
potential witnesses involved in Enron's worldwide operations to
participate if the proceedings took place in New York.</TE>
<TE>   "The focus of the financial restructuring is here," Comet said.</TE>
<TE>   Citigroup Inc. of New York, Barclays Bank of London and Dresdner
Bank of Frankfurt are among the creditors opposed to changing venues.</TE>
<TE>   Under the federal rules of bankruptcy procedure, a case may be
transferred from one district court to another "in the interest of
justice or for the convenience of the parties."</TE>
<TE>   The basic criteria considered by judges ruling on previous
change-of-venue motions have been the proximity of creditors, debtors
and witnesses; the location of assets; and the cost.</TE>
<TE>   Experts say few cases of this size have been moved but Judge
Arthur J. Gonzalez could be swayed by the fact that so many of
Enron's energy-trading partners are in and around Houston.</TE>
<TE>   Enron collapsed late last year when revelations of questionable
accounting practices and mounting debt caused investors and traders
to lose confidence in the company. The company lost $60 billion in
market value over the last year.</TE>
<TE>   Enron filed for protection from creditors under Chapter 11 of
federal bankruptcy law Dec. 2 in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the
Southern District of New York.</TE>

<HD>1st Earnings Report for 4th Quarter Due</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>On the economic calendar this week: A report on producer prices will
help investors gauge whether companies have been able to raise
prices, and Alcoa Inc.'s profit report Tuesday may give a signal of
how the battered manufacturing sector is holding up.</LD>
<LD>   Alcoa is the world's biggest aluminum producer and the first Dow
Jones industrial average-listed company to report fourth-quarter
profit.</LD>
<LD>   A slew of company announcements that said profits will beat
forecasts is encouraging investors. Profit warnings are down sharply
from recent quarters, the latest data show.</LD>
<TE>   Investors are nonetheless wary that the fourth-quarter earnings
season could bring bad news. Corporate profits still are falling and
not expected to rise again until at least the second quarter of 2002,
according to Thomson Financial/First Call. And it remains difficult
for companies to boost earnings by raising prices while the economy
is lagging.</TE>
<TE>   With a relative dearth of economic data and profit reports this
week, positive sentiment is expected to pull stocks still higher.</TE>
<TE>   Weekly jobless claims data are expected Thursday. The weekly
number, formerly overlooked by most stock investors, has become
important in recent months as Wall Street clamors for any signs of an
economic recovery.</TE>
<TE>   Last week's report showed that the number of Americans filing for
first-time unemployment benefits rose sharply to 447,000, a sign the
labor market remains soft.</TE>
<TE>   Unemployment figures are closely watched because higher
unemployment can hurt consumer spending, which makes up about
two-thirds of the nation's economy.</TE>
<TE>   Also scheduled is the producer price index Friday, which signals
changes in wholesale prices paid for goods including food and lumber.</TE>
<TE>   Wall Street economists surveyed by Reuters expect prices overall
to have slipped 0.2%, following a decline of 0.6% in the previous
month.</TE>
<TE>   Still, the core rate, which excludes the volatile food and energy
groups, is expected to rise 0.1%, after a gain of 0.2% the previous
month.</TE>

<HD>Saving Rate Misleading, Study Says</HD>
<DH>Finances: The government's method for measuring how much
Americans are putting away ignores rising home and stock values,
economists say.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JONATHAN NICHOLSON</AU>
<BD>REUTERS</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Measures of personal saving by Americans may be extraordinarily low,
but that does not necessarily mean households are putting too little
aside for retirement, according to a new study by two economists.</LD>
<LD>   Increases in wealth--in the form of rising home values and, until
recently, advances in stock prices--mean many households now have
more than traditional savings to fall back on.</LD>
<LD>   "The recent decline in personal saving rates does not in itself
indicate that households are ill-prepared to finance their retirement
or handle unexpected expenses," said economists Marshall Reinsdorf
and Maria Perozek, of the Commerce Department's Bureau of Economic
Analysis and the Federal Reserve Board, respectively. The pair's
study was to be presented at a gathering of economists in Atlanta on
Saturday.</LD>
<TE>   Their report tackles an issue that has long vexed
economists--trying to reconcile the grim saving picture painted by
the economic analysis bureau's savings data with the knowledge that
more people than ever are invested in stocks and other assets with an
eye toward retirement.</TE>
<TE>   The widely watched saving rate, published monthly by the bureau in
its income and spending report, stood at only 0.9% of disposable
personal income in November, or less than a penny from each after-tax
dollar of income. That was up from 0.2% in October. For 2000, it was
only 1.0%, down from 2.4% in 1999.</TE>
<TE>   The shrinking saving rate has alarmed policymakers, who worry that
low savings mean consumer spending, which makes up two-thirds of
economic activity, could be vulnerable to a downturn.</TE>
<TE>   But some economists have long expressed skepticism about the
government numbers. The data don't include the value of some assets
most people would think of as savings, including capital gains on
stock investments.</TE>
<TE>   However, the study shows that, even after adjusting the bureau's
data to accommodate some of the criticisms, saving is down sharply in
recent years.</TE>
<TE>   Excluding the value of defined-benefit pension plans, the saving
rate would have been slightly higher, according to the paper.
Similarly, changing the way long-lasting consumer durable items are
counted also would push the saving rate higher, as would adjusting
for capital gains.</TE>
<TE>   But, the authors noted, "We find that these adjustments tend to
flatten the contour of personal saving somewhat, but not enough to
alter the conclusion that personal saving rates have fallen to record
lows."</TE>
<TE>   To get an idea of household balance sheets, however, the authors
instead advised looking to a separate measure, household net worth,
based on quarterly data in the Federal Reserve's "flow of funds"
accounts. That measure tracks asset values held by households,
including gains in home prices and stocks held.</TE>
<TE>   "The change in net worth is useful for answering questions about
the aggregate value of household wealth, which is an indicator of the
future consumption possibilities of the household sector," Reinsdorf
and Perozek wrote.</TE>
<TE>   "However, it is important to note that the aggregate figures tell
us nothing about the distribution of wealth and saving in the
population, and therefore have limited value for addressing many
important policy questions, including issues of retirement
readiness."</TE>
<TE>   And, even by that measure, households have been hit hard by the
decline in stock prices recently. According to the Federal Reserve
Board's latest data, released in December, household net worth fell
by $1.192 trillion in the third quarter of 2001 to $38.701 trillion,
its third drop in the last four quarters.</TE>
<TE>   Compared with the third quarter of 2000, household wealth fell by
$3.810 trillion.</TE>
<TE>   Though homes added more than $270 million to household balance
sheets in the third quarter, declining stocks and mutual fund shares
subtracted $1.562 trillion from household wealth.</TE>

<LD>Question: I work in a hospital laboratory and am supposed to take my
break from 2 to 2:30 a.m., but the janitors have been told to lock
the cafeteria from 2 to 7 a.m. because the graveyard shift has been
messing it up.</LD>
<LD>   Now I can't get access to vending machines to buy food and don't
have a clean place to eat. The lab counters and tables are
contaminated with blood and other material.</LD>
<LD>   Is it legal for the company to lock the cafeteria? Does it have an
obligation to provide another clean area where we can eat?</LD>
<TE>   --L.I., La Puente</TE>
<TE>   Answer: Employers are obligated under California law to make
"suitable resting facilities" (separate from restrooms) available to
employees during working hours.</TE>
<TE>   Employers also are required to provide a suitable place for
employees to eat their meals if employees are required to eat on the
premises.</TE>
<TE>   Though you may not technically be required to remain on the
premises during your meal break, at that hour you probably are
effectively prevented from leaving the hospital to take your break.</TE>
<TE>   As a result, it appears the hospital would be required to make the
cafeteria available for you and other employees who must take their
breaks from 2 to 7 a.m., or provide another lounge area or break room
for your use.</TE>

<TE>   Tell Management When Supervisor Is Ineffective</TE>
<TE>   Q: Our company appointed a new supervisor who is in another office
and is not up to the job.</TE>
<TE>   We have had to clean up several conflicts with clients. Office
supplies aren't being purchased, and the staff is making its own work
schedules, including vacations.</TE>
<TE>   Is there any good way to intervene without harming our own careers
with the higher-ups? Or is it time to start looking for a new job?
Most of us have been here a long time and like the work we do.</TE>
<TE>   --D.Q., Oxnard</TE>
<TE>   A: If this new supervisor is not doing his or her job effectively,
management needs to know about it.</TE>
<TE>   If you present this information in a positive, constructive way,
emphasizing that you have the company's best interests at heart, I
seriously doubt there would be negative repercussions for you or your
colleagues.</TE>
<TE>   Should company management take unfair action against loyal,
concerned employees such as yourselves, you might want to consider
working for a company with a less oppressive organizational culture.</TE>

<TE>   Employee Might Be Held Accountable in Lawsuit</TE>
<TE>   Q: After leaving the company where I served as an on-site project
manager, a subcontractor sued the company, its owners and five
employees, including me, over an unpaid bill.</TE>
<TE>   As a result, I have hired a lawyer--at $265 an hour. I earned
$33.60 an hour when I was with the company.</TE>
<TE>   Working for a small company with limited assets, where employees
are asked to sign contract agreements and vendor orders doesn't seem
to be worth it if you are subject to this kind of nightmare.</TE>
<TE>   Do employees often get dragged into these kinds of disputes as
defendants?</TE>
<TE>   --M.B., Laguna Niguel</TE>
<TE>   A: Plaintiffs usually will not involve employees as defendants in
these types of matters unless the company has financial problems or
has filed for bankruptcy.</TE>
<TE>   But there's no doubt employees should be alert to potential
personal liability when acting on behalf of the employer.</TE>
<TE>   If the contract you signed states that you are personally
guaranteeing the debt, you may be technically responsible.</TE>
<TE>   You also might be held personally responsible if you sign payroll
checks without the proper withholding and if the company does not
eventually pay these amounts.</TE>
<TE>   Regardless of the employer's responsibility, you may have been
included in the lawsuit without proper justification.</TE>
<TE>   Signing a contract would not make you responsible if it is obvious
you are acting simply as your employer's agent.</TE>
<TE>   You should ask the plaintiff's attorney to justify your
involvement in the lawsuit. You or your attorney might consider
mentioning "malicious prosecution," in which the plaintiffs might
face liability for suing you without an adequate reason.</TE>
<TE>   Your former employer also should be motivated to pay your
attorney's fees. The company probably would want to maintain you as a
"friendly" witness, for example, to help protect it from liability.</TE>
<TE>   California law also requires an employer to reimburse employees
for work-related expenses, and these fees should fall within that
area.</TE>

<KH>EXECUTIVE ROUNDTABLE</KH>
<HD>Many Options Available for Small-Business Financing</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Executive Roundtable is a weekly column by TEC Worldwide, an
international organization of more than 7,000 business owners,
company presidents and chief executives. TEC members meet in small
peer groups to share their business experiences and help each other
solve problems in a round-table session. The following questions and
answers are summaries of discussions at recent TEC meetings in
Southern California.</LD>
<LD>   Question: I have some ambitious growth plans for my small
manufacturing business, but it will take a lot of money to get us
where I want to go. Other than a bank line of credit, I have no
experience with the capital markets. What should I know before
looking for some serious growth money?</LD>
<LD>   Answer: Not too long ago, small companies had few borrowing
options beyond their bankers and trade creditors. In today's
multifaceted financial markets, however, entrepreneurial firms have
access to a variety of lending institutions and products. Given the
complex nature of most capital transactions, it pays to know what
you're doing before borrowing large amounts of money or leveraging
yourself to the hilt.</LD>
<TE>   Gordon Tunstall, who runs Tunstall Consulting Inc. in Tampa, Fla.,
has been helping high-growth companies develop financial strategies
and obtain capital funding for more than 20 years. He recommends the
following:</TE>
<TE>   * Research the capital markets. Current capital markets offer a
variety of lending alternatives. In addition, today's capital deals
often combine several types of lending tools and techniques.
Investing some time upfront to learn about the types of financing
available and how to use them properly will enable you to get the
best deal and avoid getting taken to the cleaners by sophisticated
lenders.</TE>
<TE>   * Match your financing needs with the correct lender and financing
product. After determining the framework of your financing needs,
identify the type of lender that fits your industry, your type of
company and your specific financing needs. For example, don't
approach a bank or commercial lender if you need mezzanine financing,
because you won't have the collateral to support the loan. Similarly,
borrowing from a venture capitalist when you could have used
mezzanine financing may cause you to give away more equity than
necessary. If you're uncertain about which type of lender to use,
hire a professional who knows the markets and can help you find the
right type of financing for your borrowing needs.</TE>
<TE>   * Write a world-class business plan. In order to get the most
money at the best terms, create a business plan that lenders can't
resist. Make it clear so lenders can understand it and compelling so
they believe you can get where you want to go.</TE>
<TE>   "A well-documented business plan contains both narrative
description and hard numbers," Tunstall said. "The key is making sure
that one supports the other. For example, every line item in the plan
should have some narrative that describes the assumptions behind the
numbers. However, the narrative must be credible or the lender won't
buy your plan. Above all, don't think that a two-page summary will
capture the attention of lenders. It takes more than a few pages to
provide the raw data to support your projections and conclusions."</TE>
<TE>   * Minimize risk. Entrepreneurs often think they have to bet the
farm in order to obtain financing. However, sound financing should
involve less risk, not more. To minimize your exposure, look for
lenders willing to structure flexible deals. Avoid agreements filled
with restrictive covenants and warrants. Don't take out a second lien
on your house or give any kind of personal guarantees. Build a
cushion into the deal in case things go wrong.</TE>
<TE>   Before signing any financing agreement, always ask yourself, "Am I
taking more risk to finance this growth than I did before I decided
to grow the company?" If the answer is yes, don't sign.</TE>
<TE>   * Adjust your lending agreement for actual performance. When
lending institutions create loan packages, they typically discount
your performance projections and increase their compensation through
additional fees or equity. In most cases, you can't avoid this
discounting because lenders need some way to protect themselves.
However, you can negotiate a performance clause that adjusts the
terms should you achieve your objectives in the agreement. If your
lender refuses to consider this option, shop around for a different
lender.</TE>
<TE>   * Conduct a broad search of lending institutions. When looking for
growth capital, start with about 100 lenders and work your way down
to a final "short list." In particular, look for lenders who
specialize in your industry and the size and type of your company. If
you're looking to grow a chain of auto repair shops, for example,
don't approach a venture capitalist who specializes in lending to
biotech companies. Once you have a small group of finalists, present
your business plan to all of them at the same time. By creating
competition among several lenders, you increase your chances of
getting the best deal.</TE>
<TE>   * Think big. Plan your borrowing based on your company's
potential, not on your current capital position. Project how much you
would need to grow the company to its full potential and strive to
get the best financing with the least risk, the least dilution and
fairest transaction terms. "Also, make sure you like and respect the
people you deal with at the lending institution," Tunstall said.

<HD>New Balance Has Foothold in U.S.</HD>
<DH>Apparel: New Balance this week becomes the last major
athletic shoe company still assembling its products in this country.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>WILL EDWARDS and ANDRIA CHENG</AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL>LAWRENCE, Mass.</DL>
<LD>With a flip of the wrist, Phil Vachon, a manufacturing supervisor for
New Balance Athletic Shoe Inc.,  turns a piece of red, black and
white cardboard into a box.</LD>
<LD>   Vachon then throws in some tissue and a pair of women's running
shoes, finishing the task in no more than a few seconds.</LD>
<LD>   This week, New Balance will be the last major maker of athletic
footwear that still assembles shoes in the U.S. The owners of the
Lawrence factory in which Vachon works say advanced machinery,
teamwork and patriotism counter the advantage of labor that is
one-third as expensive in China.</LD>
<TE>   "We consider ourselves manufacturers when none of our competitors
are anymore," said Chief Executive Jim Davis, 58, who bought the
company in 1972. "Though the Boston-based company also has sent jobs
overseas, it has increased its U.S. presence. Closely held New
Balance employed 1,200 U.S. workers last year, compared with 670 in
1994.</TE>
<TE>   The number of Americans making rubber and plastic footwear shrank
to 4,100 from 10,800 in the same period, according to the U.S. Bureau
of Labor Statistics.</TE>
<TE>   More jobs are going. Saucony Inc. said in November that it would
close its remaining U.S. plant in Bangor, Maine. The last of its 70
employees will lose their jobs this week as the company shifts all
production to Asia, making New Balance the one U.S. holdout.</TE>
<TE>   Nike Inc., the largest maker, shifted whole-shoe manufacturing
operations to Asia in the early 1990s, spokesman Vada Manager said.
Nike still makes air cushions for its shoes in Missouri and Oregon,
he said.</TE>
<TE>   New Balance was headed in that direction in the second half of the
1990s, when it increased its share of overseas production to 75% from
45%. Davis, whose goal is to bring that closer to 50%, said the
company turned to Asian manufacturers after U.S. factories couldn't
meet demand.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, it began looking for ways to expand in the U.S.
In 1997, the company opened a plant in Norway, Maine, employing an
extra 221 people and bringing the number of its U.S. factories to
five. A sixth plant in Ontario, owned by Taiwan's Pou Chen Corp.,
makes shoes exclusively for New Balance.</TE>
<TE>   The company had 9.6% of the $7.8-billion market for athletic shoes
in the U.S. in 2000, according to Sporting Goods Intelligence, an
industry newsletter. Nike had 43% of the market, measured on the
wholesale level. Reebok International Ltd. had 12% and Adidas-Salomon
11%.</TE>
<TE>   Herbert Spivak, executive vice president of operations at New
Balance, said U.S. factories can be justified as long as the cost of
making shoes here doesn't exceed the cost of imports by more than
15%.</TE>
<TE>   New Balance can make up that difference by offering faster
delivery to retailers, being closer to its research and development
team and having employees devise ways to produce shoes more
efficiently.</TE>
<TE>   "We can only do this here if we can get close to the imported
cost. That's what drives our workers," Spivak said.</TE>

<HD>New Post-Enron Rules Considered</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>U.S. Treasury Secretary Paul H. O'Neill said Sunday his department
was reviewing whether revisions were necessary in U.S. regulations to
protect investors after the collapse of energy giant Enron Corp.</LD>
<LD>   "I think the dust hasn't cleared yet on this case and it is not
clear whether the company fulfilled all of its obligations under the
existing rules," O'Neill said of provisions that allowed top
executives to sell shares while employees holding Enron stock in
retirement plans could not.</LD>
<LD>   "If they did [comply with U.S. regulations], it suggests that we
need rule change. If, on the contrary, it turns out that they didn't
fully comply with all the rules, we have a different issue on our
hands," O'Neill said on NBC's "Meet the Press."</LD>
<TE>   He declined to elaborate on issues that noncompliance would raise.</TE>
<TE>   Houston-based Enron is under investigation in Washington by the
market-regulating Securities and Exchange Commission, the Justice and
Labor departments and at least five congressional committees.</TE>
<TE>   A Wall Street darling just a few months ago, Enron on Dec. 2 made
the largest bankruptcy filing in U.S. history after a rescue takeover
by rival Dynegy Inc. fell apart amid investor concerns about Enron's
murky finances.</TE>
<TE>   Once ranked No. 7 on the Fortune 500 list of top companies,
Enron's stock on Friday closed at 66 cents a share on the New York
Stock Exchange, off from an August 2000 high of $90.</TE>
<TE>   Thousands of Enron employees lost their jobs and much of their
retirement savings in the collapse.</TE>

<HD>Canadian Firm to Make Interiors for GM Trucks</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL>DETROIT</DL>
<LD>General Motors Corp. said it awarded a Magna International Inc.
subsidiary a contract to supply the total interior for its next
generation of full-size truck, an agreement an analyst valued at as
much as $3 billion a year to the Canadian auto-parts company.</LD>
<LD>   The contract would have Magna's Intier Automotive Inc. eventually
supplying interiors for almost 2 million vehicles a year, said Bo
Andersson, GM's vice president of worldwide purchasing. The biggest
auto maker's large pickups and sport-utility vehicles probably will
be redesigned beginning in 2005.</LD>
<LD>   "It's a big validation of GM's faith in Intier's ability to
deliver," said Kenneth Blaschke, an auto-supplier analyst at Deutsche
Bank Alex. Brown who estimated the contract's value. "Intier has this
big backlog because GM trusts what Magna has done in the past."</LD>
<TE>   A spokesman for Magna, Canada's largest parts maker, couldn't
immediately be reached for comment.</TE>
<TE>   GM has been contracting out the design and management of its
vehicle interiors to cut costs and improve quality. The auto maker
has outsourced the interior management of 75% of its vehicles,
Andersson said at the North American International Auto Show in
Detroit, which officially opens today. Until now GM has manufactured
the interiors for its full-size trucks, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Sales of GM full-size sport-utilities rose 29% last year to
537,193 and full-size pickup sales rose 18% to 979,706.</TE>
<TE>   Magna sold about $63 million in Intier shares in an initial public
offering in August and still retains voting control over the interior
unit. Intier, which hasn't yet reported full-year results, said it
had $2.4 billion in pro forma sales in the first nine months of 2001.</TE>
<TE>   Magna's U.S. shares rose $1.76 to close Friday at $66.82; GM rose
74 cents to $50.09. Both trade on the New York Stock Exchange.</TE>
<TE>   GM has awarded interior management contracts to other suppliers,
including Lear Corp., Johnson Controls Inc. and closely held Venture
Industries.</TE>
<TE>   "It's too early to say how successful we are but based on what we
experienced, we see that things are going better," Andersson said.
"We have better control over what they're doing ....  There's no
finger-pointing because there's just one company."</TE>

<HD>Report: Bridgestone, Ford to Make Peace</HD>
<DH>Automotive: A Japanese newspaper says the companies torn
apart by tire debacle agree to restore relations.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL>DETROIT</DL>
<LD>Ford Motor Co. declined to comment on Japanese news reports that the
second-largest auto maker tentatively agreed to settle disputes and
restore normal business relations with tire maker Bridgestone Corp.</LD>
<LD>   "We have been talking, we have nothing to announce," said Ford
spokesman Ken Zino. Bridgestone spokeswoman Setsuko Ozaki said Asia's
biggest tire maker is ready to hold more talks with Ford, after their
two meetings last year in the U.S.</LD>
<LD>   During the upcoming talks, the companies also are expected to
discuss whether Japan-based Bridgestone will reimburse Ford for money
spent recalling tires made by Bridgestone's U.S. unit,
Bridgestone/Firestone Americas Holding Inc., the Yomiuri newspaper
said, citing unnamed people.</LD>
<TE>   Ford and Bridgestone have argued over blame for an estimated 271
U.S. highway deaths involving Firestone tires, most of them on Ford
Explorer sport-utility vehicles.</TE>
<TE>   Former Ford Chief Executive Jacques Nasser last year ordered all
Firestone tires replaced on Ford vehicles, costing the auto maker
$2.1 billion and resulting in a second-quarter loss.</TE>
<TE>   When Chairman William Clay Ford Jr. ousted Nasser in late October,
he signaled that he wanted improved relations with Bridgestone. "It
would be in our mutual interest to work something out," Ford Group
Vice President James Padilla said Sunday at the North American
International Auto Show in Detroit, without commenting directly on
the Yomiuri report.</TE>
<TE>   Ford Chief Operating Officer Nick Scheele met with Bridgestone
Chief Executive Shigeo Watanabe in Honolulu in November, the two have
said. The meeting was followed by another last month between Scheele
and John Lampe, chief executive of Bridgestone/Firestone, in Detroit.</TE>
<TE>   "The meetings were fruitful," said Christine Karbowiak, a
Bridgestone/Firestone spokeswoman. She declined to comment further.</TE>
<TE>   Ford shares ended trading Friday 21 cents higher at $16.94 on the
New York Stock Exchange.</TE>

<HD>Preparing Homes for a New Era in Media</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JON HEALEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>At a time of slumping consumer-electronics sales, a number of
companies are charging to the next level of digital evolution with
devices that promise to deliver the long-hyped convergence of old and
new media to the living room.</LD>
<LD>   This equipment can record and transmit music and video from a
variety of sources throughout the home. Known as "media gateways,"
the devices are designed to mix songs or programs grabbed off the Web
with live TV, prerecorded programs and audio or video discs.</LD>
<LD>   Although the public has yet to show an interest, a dozen or more
such devices are expected to be on display at the annual
International Consumer Electronics Show, beginning today in Las
Vegas.</LD>
<TE>   Consumers are already abandoning many conventional analog products
in favor of digital versions. Sharp declines in orders for analog TVs
and VCRs helped drive down factory sales of all consumer electronics
2% in 2001, despite huge increases in sales of digital TVs, DVD
players, cameras and game equipment, according to a study to be
released today by the Consumer Electronics Assn.</TE>
<TE>   Nevertheless, skeptics say it's too early for media gateways,
given consumers' chilly response to digital video recorders,
home-networking gear and other key elements of the future digital
home. But a major satellite operator is committing to a gateway
designed by Moxi Digital Inc. of Palo Alto, suggesting that these
devices will get a toehold in the market this year.</TE>
<TE>   For consumers, the benefit could be more music and movies piped to
any speakers or screens around the home. But it won't be free,
because satellite and cable operators expect to charge extra monthly
fees for the additional convenience and programming.</TE>
<TE>   Digital technology has been a godsend for the consumer-electronics
industry. Not only have manufacturers reinvented all their
audiovisual and communications products, they've accelerated the
creation, improvement and obsolescence of new devices.</TE>
<TE>   2001 was a watershed year in the digital transition. Analyst Tom
Edwards, who monitors consumer-electronics sales for NPD Intellect,
noted two firsts: DVD player sales surpassed VCR sales, and
digital-projection TVs brought in more revenue than analog projection
sets.</TE>
<TE>   The year also saw the introduction of a digital radio service for
cars: XM, the first of two new satellite-delivered radio ventures.</TE>
<TE>   Predictably, this year's Consumer Electronics Show will be filled
with new models of digital TVs, DVD units, portable music players and
other digital gadgets, many of them aimed at wealthy tech
enthusiasts. But it also will be the launching pad for a new
generation of convergence devices, such as the Moxi media gateway,
which has been in the works for two years.</TE>
<TE>   The goal of these new devices is to let consumers enjoy CDs, DVDs,
TV channels and entertainment from the Web on any screen or stereo in
the house. They do this by combining a disc reader and a
high-capacity hard drive with the ability to connect to the TV, the
Internet and a digital home network.</TE>
<TE>   Such devices would give consumers a central storehouse for their
scattered music and video collections, while providing more control
over when and where they tune in media.</TE>
<TE>   However, early attempts at media gateways have been costly,
complex and difficult for consumers to use.</TE>
<TE>   Among the companies selling or developing some kind of media
gateway are Sonicblue, which has an Internet-enabled audio jukebox
and a video recorder that can tune in TV or Web-based video; TiVo
Inc., which plans a version of its personal video recorder that goes
beyond TV recording; Thomson Multimedia, maker of RCA-brand
audiovisual gear; ZapMedia; Kenwood; Escient; and such
computer-industry stalwarts as Intel Corp., Compaq Computer Corp. and
Hewlett-Packard Co.</TE>
<TE>   Thomson is teaming with Intertainer Inc., a Culver City company
that delivers music and movies on demand through secure online
networks, to create a limited media gateway, said Jonathan Taplin,
Intertainer's chief executive. The set-top box is designed to play
DVDs and, by connecting to a home network, receive DVD-quality video
from Intertainer through a high-speed Internet connection.</TE>
<TE>   Taplin said Verizon Communications Inc. plans to test the boxes
with selected high-speed Internet customers later this year.</TE>
<TE>   The key to widespread deployment of any media gateway is backing
from a major service provider, such as a cable TV or satellite
company, said analyst P.J. McNealy of the GartnerG2 technology
research firm. Moxi has lined up that kind of supporter, he said:
EchoStar Communications Corp., which operates DishNetwork and is in a
deal to buy DirecTV.</TE>
<TE>   EchoStar officials say they plan to deploy Moxi's technology in
advanced satellite receivers, although it didn't say how many or
when. Mark Jackson, senior vice president of EchoStar Technologies
Corp., said Moxi offers EchoStar a way to sell downloadable music and
other new services, while also cutting the cost of serving homes with
multiple TV sets.</TE>
<TE>   Formerly known as Rearden Steel Technologies, Moxi designs
software and hardware for media gateways, relying on other companies
to build the units. It plans to sell its technology to satellite and
cable operators, not directly to consumers.</TE>
<TE>   Moxi's main unit functions as a master receiver, recorder and
storage bin for media from the consumer's personal collection, the
Internet and satellite or cable TV. It would connect to extension
units and to home computers through wireless signals or coaxial
cable.</TE>
<TE>   A key feature of the software is a media guide that steers users
not just to TV channels, but also to recorded and online media
related to specific shows or performers. It also can transmit
different channels or recorded media simultaneously to different
rooms in the house.</TE>
<TE>   Moxi was founded by Steve Perlman, who sold his last invention,
WebTV, to Microsoft Corp. for $503 million.</TE>
<TE>   WebTV was one of the first devices to bring the Internet and
e-mail to a TV, but its popularity stalled at close to 1 million
subscribers.</TE>
<TE>   After founding Rearden Steel two years ago, he raised $67 million
from several top-tier media companies and investors, including AOL
Time Warner, EchoStar, Cisco Systems and Vulcan Ventures, the
investment company owned by former Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen.</TE>
<TE>   Charter Communications, the cable TV company owned by Vulcan
Ventures, has prototypes of an undisclosed media gateway that it
plans to test this year, Chief Technical Officer Stephen Silva said.
"It's one of the things that we're trying to get a good understanding
of the customer need and demand [for] right now," he added.</TE>
<TE>   Even some proponents of home networking and media gateways, such
as Sonicblue and Microsoft, say the demand isn't there yet. Andrew
Wolfe, chief technical officer of Sonicblue, said there aren't enough
services available online to justify selling a full-blown media
gateway.</TE>
<TE>   A number of online video and music suppliers such as Intertainer
are emerging for gateways to tap into. But before gateway providers
can build a business around those services, they'll have to wean
consumers from services such as Napster that let users copy movies
and songs from each other for free.</TE>
<TE>   Larry Gerbrandt, chief content officer for the Kagan World Media
research and consulting firm, said Napster taught consumers that they
can find content online. "The question is, can you overcome the
legacy of Napster and convince people it should be downloaded at a
price?"</TE>

<HD>Chrysler Leads Charge With U.S.-German Coupe</HD>
<DH>Autos: The two-seat Crossfire is one of three new vehicles
the group is unveiling in an effort to regain ground.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TERRIL YUE JONES and JOHN O'DELL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Almost a year into the Chrysler Group's far-reaching restructuring
program, the U.S. division of DaimlerChrysler is launching an
offensive of all-new products aimed at regaining ground with the
head-turning allure Chrysler vehicles have shown in the past.</LD>
<LD>   Over six days, the Chrysler Group--composed of Chrysler, Dodge and
Jeep--is unveiling three all-new production vehicles, one of them
with its engine and significant other parts from its cousin brand,
Mercedes-Benz.</LD>
<LD>   Chrysler introduced the Crossfire, a two-seat sports coupe
introduced at the Los Angeles International Auto Show last week, and
took the wraps off the Pacifica, a "crossover" vehicle that's half
sport-utility vehicle, half station wagon, at the North America
International Auto Show in Detroit. Dodge is expected to introduce a
performance pickup truck Tuesday in Detroit.</LD>
<TE>   The vehicles will go on sale next year. Joining them is a $20,000
SRT performance version of the Dodge Neon with 205 horsepower that
goes 0 to 60 mph in 5.9 seconds.</TE>
<TE>   Chrysler's decision to build the Crossfire, which it introduced as
a concept at the Detroit show just a year ago, appears to be a
new--and controversial--statement of intent from the company's top
management in Germany, executives who once swore they would never
dilute Mercedes-Benz's DNA by blending it with Chrysler's.</TE>
<TE>   The production model of the Crossfire is being pitched as just
such a blend--a mix of Route 66 and the autobahn, American design and
Teutonic precision.</TE>
<TE>   "It is the first true child of the merger" in 1998 of Germany's
Daimler-Benz and the former Chrysler Corp., said Wolfgang Bernhard,
Chrysler Group's chief operating officer.</TE>
<TE>   Chrysler plans to begin selling the car next year as a 2004 model.</TE>
<TE>   "Bringing it from concept to the showroom in just two years was
only possible because we were able to work closely with our sister,
Mercedes-Benz," Bernhard said. "With the connections I have to
Stuttgart, we figured stuff out."</TE>
<TE>   Bernhard, an engineer with an MBA from Columbia University, was
dispatched from headquarters in late 2000 as Chrysler's chief
operating officer, along with Chief Executive Dieter Zetsche, after a
series of American executives were ousted amid a sea of red ink.</TE>
<TE>   The 41-year-old Bernhard previously headed AMG, the
high-performance unit of Mercedes-Benz, and has little patience for
endless meetings.</TE>
<TE>   "No focus groups.... Speed, speed, speed and get it done," he said
of the Crossfire.</TE>
<TE>   "It's an American design, it's a mainstream American sports car,
no question about that. But we take Mercedes parts and pieces and
realize that design....Only we, as Chrysler, can do that. Nobody else
in the industry can do that," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "Ford cannot go to Jaguar and get these great components and
pieces; GM cannot go to Opel. But we can do that and benefit from
it," Bernhard said. "This will be a new recipe, and I'm very
confident that this new mixture that we're getting is going to be a
success."</TE>
<TE>   The Crossfire is the first of a series of new Chrysler products
that will borrow heavily from Mercedes-Benz and from Japan's
Mitsubishi Motor Corp., which DaimlerChrysler now controls. The
replacements for the compact Dodge Neon, as well as the Dodge Stratus
and Chrysler Sebring mid-size sedans, will be built on Mitsubishi
platforms, he said.</TE>
<TE>   There are several reasons for joint development, and saving money
by sharing engineering and platform-development costs isn't the least
of them. But paramount is improving the quality of domestic vehicles
and boosting consumers' perception of that quality, Bernhard said.</TE>
<TE>   The renewed product assault comes at a time when the auto maker is
regaining some ground in the U.S. market by offering 0% financing and
cash-back incentives.</TE>
<TE>   "DaimlerChrysler gained a whopping 5.1 share points in December
and 1 point for the full year," said Merrill Lynch auto industry
analyst John Casesa. "The company has re-priced and repackaged its
lineup and appears to be taking share from GM."</TE>
<TE>   But the incentives are costing money that Chrysler can ill afford.</TE>
<TE>   Jim Schroer, Chrysler Group's executive vice president of sales
and marketing, said the company won't match General Motors Corp.'s
new $2,002 cash rebate program for purchases or leases on most GM
vehicles.</TE>
<TE>   "We will not make an across-the-board discount giveaway," Schroer
said. "It gets you the maximum short-term sales lift. But that
doesn't maximize sales or profits over time. It wouldn't be in the
best interests of our shareholders to do that."</TE>
<TE>   Part of the key to Chrysler's cost-cutting strategy is sharing
parts among its brands.</TE>
<TE>   Access to Mercedes components "is great for Chrysler," said David
Bradley, J.P. Morgan's auto industry analyst in New York. "Whether
there's a negative trade-off for Mercedes is hard to say. There would
be some questions of whether Chrysler's engineering is up to snuff,
but knowing Mercedes is in the background will be a big help."</TE>
<TE>   The Crossfire could be a badly needed hit for Chrysler, said Jeff
Schuster, director of North American auto market forecasting for J.D.
Power &amp; Associates.</TE>
<TE>   "It is something that needs to happen to further the restructuring
of Chrysler and to make it a brand with an image again," Schuster
said. "Chrysler has not been very strong on the car side, and I'm
glad Bernhard says it will be an available car and not one of those
untouchables that's put out there just for people to drool over."</TE>
<TE>   The Crossfire was designed in the U.S. by Chrysler but will be
assembled in Germany by coach builder Karmann.</TE>
<TE>   Visually, the car pays homage to so-called boat-tailed speedsters
of the 1930s, with a low, squat stance and long hood whose lines
sweep back through rear quarter panels, which wrap around to meet the
sharply sloped fast-back rear deck in a tight, almost pointed, tail.</TE>
<TE>   Power will come from a 215-horsepower, 3.2-liter V-6 engine from
the Mercedes E-Class with a choice of either a six-speed manual or
five-speed electronically controlled automatic transmission.</TE>
<TE>   "It should be a very credible car," said George Peterson,
president of AutoPacific Inc., an automotive market research firm in
Tustin. "Building it that way says to the consumer that there is a
very different quality equation for future Chrysler products than
there is today."</TE>
<TE>   During a walk Thursday through the Los Angeles show, Bob Lutz--the
former Chrysler vice chairman hired by General Motors late last year
to lead a revival of its stale passenger car lines--said he was
"favorably impressed" with the Crossfire, which was developed after
he left Chrysler from an earlier large-car concept he had overseen.</TE>
<TE>   The look of the two-seater, he said, is that of "a bunched-up cat
that's ready to pounce."</TE>
<TE>   The sleek Pacifica is a much larger car that has a third row of
seats so it can fit up to six people. Like Chrysler's wildly popular
PT Cruiser, the Pacifica is meant to defy categorization, though it's
safe to call it a cross between a station wagon and an SUV. It has
low step-in height, plush seating, a number of comfort and safety
amenities and car-like handling.</TE>
<TE>   Pacifica does not fit into any existing automotive category, CEO
Zetsche said.</TE>
<TE>   "It's an all-new segment that will follow the success of our
original minivan and PT Cruiser. The Pacifica is a sports tourer with
the right formula of proportions, packaging, performance and
appearance that will set it far apart from our competition," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Chrysler won't release pricing information other than to say the
Pacifica will be $25,000-plus.</TE>

<HD>Conyers to Press for Tougher Enforcement of Laws on Payola</HD>
<DH>Broadcasting: Ranking Democrat on the House Judiciary
Committee plans to call hearings this year.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHUCK PHILIPS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>DETROIT</DL>
<LD>It's been more than a decade since Congress last probed payola on the
public airwaves. Rep. John Conyers Jr. (D-Mich.) plans to revisit the
issue by launching federal hearings this year to address increasing
complaints from artists, consumer activists and record labels about
questionable payments to radio stations to promote certain songs.</LD>
<LD>   Conyers, 72, the ranking Democrat on the House Judiciary
Committee, has had serious concerns about the radio business since
Congress passed the 1996 Telecommunications Act, which eliminated
most restrictions on broadcast mergers.</LD>
<LD>   Conyers, an amateur musician himself, will air his views about
payola and other industry issues at the Future of Music Policy Summit
this week at Georgetown University in Washington. He sat down for an
interview recently at his office in Detroit.</LD>
<TE>   Question: It's been 40 years since the federal payola statute was
enacted. Considering the government's apparently lax attitude toward
prosecuting payola violations, why not just get rid of the law?</TE>
<TE>   Answer: Well, I'm sure there are people in the music business and
the radio industry that would immediately advocate that kind of an
idea. But getting rid of the law would be a bad idea.</TE>
<TE>   What we really need to do is beef up enforcement. I want to hold
informational oversight hearings this year to look closer at
potential new forms of payola that appear to be everywhere now. We
need to examine the negative impact that consolidation in the radio
business has had on the public airwaves.</TE>
<TE>   Q: Given its past enforcement actions, the Federal Communications
Commission seems more concerned about bad lyrics than bribes. The FCC
has imposed only one payola fine on a major radio group and seems to
have no problem with the U.S. record labels'  paying out an estimated
$100 million-plus a year to influence airplay on stations owned by
the nation's biggest broadcasters.</TE>
<TE>   Maybe payola laws are obsolete in a deregulated radio environment.</TE>
<TE>   A: I disagree. Payola is against the public interest. It turns the
whole notion of encouraging and promoting this important part of our
cultural heritage into a commercial vehicle.</TE>
<TE>   Some of the most imaginative art on earth was born in the hearts
and souls of American composers. I believe that music is one of our
major contributions to world culture. Allowing creativity to be
stifled because of questionable commercial endeavors or legal
gymnastics is just plain wrong.</TE>
<TE>   I believe that's what the government originally had in mind when
they implemented laws prohibiting the influence of money on airplay.</TE>
<TE>   Q: We're no longer just talking about some tiny independent radio
station pocketing a few bucks under the table, but about giant
broadcast corporations devising questionable practices to generate
"nontraditional revenue" to sidestep payola laws.</TE>
<TE>   A: Well, at least that explains why I'm hearing so much bad music
so often lately. This stuff that is cluttering up the public airwaves
should be an embarrassment to the folks who run the industry.</TE>
<TE>   Q: Do you think the investigators at the FCC really care?</TE>
<TE>   A: The environment for enforcement is not alive in America
anymore. There seems to be a new environment now, one that says
unless you are a flagrant, notorious violator, no one will take you
to task anymore.</TE>
<TE>   It's like no one is paying attention to the federal laws on the
books. Nobody is encouraging anyone to go out and investigate
practices at radio stations that seem suspicious or fraudulent. We no
longer live in an enforcement environment that is favorable to the
consumer.</TE>
<TE>   [FCC Chairman] Michael Powell makes [former FCC Chairman] Bill
Kennard look tough now, doesn't he? But we can't just keep acting
like we're blind.</TE>
<TE>   Q: What can be done?</TE>
<TE>   A: The FCC and the antitrust division of the Justice Department
need to start paying attention to the citizen groups, community
activists and musicians who have all thrown up their hands in
disgust.</TE>
<TE>   A lot of artists' careers get compromised after they get to the
top because of these [payola] transactions. And many more never even
get a chance to get near the top. They get squeezed out.</TE>
<TE>   In my opinion, it's not just the artist who loses. The culture
loses.</TE>
<TE>   Q: It's illegal to air a song for money or anything of value
without saying so on the air. The way record labels seem to sidestep
the law is by hiring independent promoters to pay stations annual
budgets to avoid the quid pro quo restrictions of the payola statute.
What's the difference?</TE>
<TE>   A: I think that maybe some clever lawyers helped the promoters
think this annual budget idea up. It's really pretty nifty.</TE>
<TE>   I don't know how it fares against the legal prohibitions that are
in effect. Because no one has ever really examined these deals, I
don't know if they are successful in skirting the law, or if a court
would just pull this aside as a cover window dressing to accomplish
what was, in fact, prohibited.</TE>
<TE>   We intend to look into this matter more carefully.</TE>
<TE>   Q: Most independent record promoters these days base their budget
deals with radio stations on the bank formula concept. The bank is an
internal log that lists the date the station airs a song followed by
a specific dollar figure the station will be paid by the artist's
label. Isn't that a quid pro quo?</TE>
<TE>   A: Well, the bank log clearly pulls away the guise of the annual
budget. If the station is being credited on a per-play basis, it
changes things pretty drastically, doesn't it? It's not good.</TE>
<TE>   I don't know how they expect to explain this bank idea in the
light of long-standing regulations against payola in the industry.
We'll have to ask the promoters and the radio corporations and the
record companies.</TE>
<TE>   Q: How has consolidation after the Telecommunications Act affected
the public airwaves?</TE>
<TE>   A: It's bad. You know, the original idea was that leasing the
airwaves to broadcast companies would be a service for our citizens.
Back when the government started issuing broadcast licenses, it
repeated over and over again: "The airwaves belong to the people."</TE>
<TE>   The idea was that we were only renting these guys the airwaves on
a temporary basis subject to their living up to the modest
regulations.</TE>
<TE>   But now we seem to be going in a different direction. Less
regulation. Less oversight. Less enforcement. Competition is drying
up. Monopoly is on the rise. The whole thing is becoming more of a
business and less of an arena for communication about new musical
ideas.</TE>
<TE>   It's bigger than a simple dispute between the artists and the
radio conglomerates. This is a matter of national interest.</TE>
<TE>   The problem has been growing since the Telecommunications Act. The
protections for the airwaves just aren't the same anymore.</TE>
<TE>   There is not enough oversight of these kind of transactions. The
government has been snoozing. We intend to probe these issues and ask
a lot of questions this year.</TE>

<HD>Insurers in State Must Provide Terror Coverage</HD>
<DH>Regulation: Language of exemptions OKd outside California
raises concern that hate crimes also could be excluded.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LIZ PULLIAM WESTON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>California will continue to require insurance companies to provide
terrorism coverage even though 20 other states have approved
exceptions limiting insurers' risk, state officials said.</LD>
<LD>   California regulators worry that the terrorism exclusion language
adopted by other states, which was drafted by the insurance industry,
could be interpreted too broadly and allow insurers to disallow
coverage for hate crimes, said state Department of Insurance Deputy
Commissioner Scott Edelen.</LD>
<LD>   "If somebody burns down a church, we want to be sure it's
covered," Edelen said.</LD>
<TE>   States began adopting the exclusion language late last year after
Congress failed to act on legislation that would have limited
insurers' liability for terrorism-related damage.</TE>
<TE>   Insurers have said they can pay the expected
$40-billion-to-$70-billion cost of the Sept. 11 attacks, but might
not be able to pay for damage from future terrorist acts.</TE>
<TE>   Insurers pressed lawmakers to act after major reinsurers--the
companies that essentially help insurers share their risk--announced
they would drop terrorism coverage when their contracts with insurers
expired Dec. 31. Most insurance companies want to drop such coverage
as well, but state law prevented many from doing so.</TE>
<TE>   Insurance Services Office Inc., which designs insurance policy
wording, crafted language that state regulators could use to allow
insurers to exclude terrorism coverage from their commercial lines.
Personal lines, such as homeowners and auto coverage, are not
affected.</TE>
<TE>   The language was subsequently approved by the National Assn. of
Insurance Commissioners, which represents state regulators.</TE>
<TE>   Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey and Arizona are
among the 20 states that have allowed insurers to drop terrorism
coverage for commercial property insurance and other commercial
lines. Other states have either taken no action or said they would
wait to see if Congress comes up with a solution.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. Senate is expected to take up the issue again this month,
and California regulators hope legislation can be crafted that makes
state action unnecessary, Edelen said.</TE>
<TE>   Regulators and insurance brokers said California's refusal to
adopt the exclusion has not disrupted insurance markets here,
although prices for commercial property insurance in general, and
terrorism coverage in particular, have risen sharply. Some businesses
are choosing to do without terrorism coverage rather than pay the
higher costs, brokers said.</TE>
<TE>   "There may very well be an impact down the line" if Congress fails
to act and California doesn't adopt the exclusions, said Stephen
Young, general counsel for the Insurance Brokers and Agents of the
West, a trade group.</TE>

<HD>Nvidia Is on Top of Its Game</HD>
<DH>Leading graphics chip maker is the darling of users and
Wall Street.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ALEX PHAM</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Among Silicon Valley nerds, chip engineers like Jen-Hsun Huang are
the geekiest of all.</LD>
<LD>   But when the 38-year-old founder of Nvidia Corp. strolls the
streets in a T-shirt emblazoned with his company logo, he gets
stopped for his autograph. Granted, those asking are avid computer
game players who shell out hundreds of dollars for each graphics card
that contains one of Nvidia's high-end chips.</LD>
<LD>   These days, though, it's not just consumers who are enamored of
Huang and his company. Wall Street also is swooning. Despite a
meltdown in technology stocks, Nvidia finished 2001 as the best
performer in the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index. The chip maker replaced
Enron Corp. in the index in late November.</LD>
<TE>   "The company has just had extraordinary execution," said Mark
Edelstone, analyst with Morgan Stanley Dean Witter in San Francisco.</TE>
<TE>   Nvidia shares Friday fell $2.09 to close at $69.62 on Nasdaq.</TE>
<TE>   This year, the question is whether Nvidia can sustain its
performance in what is essentially a cutthroat commodity business in
which prices plunge a few months after the introduction of new
products.</TE>
<TE>   The answer depends on how well the Santa Clara, Calif., company
continues to crank out blazingly fast graphics chips ahead of its
rivals, which include Intel Corp. and ATI Technologies Inc.</TE>
<TE>   To survive in the semiconductor business, companies must stay on
the bleeding edge of technology. Being fastest and best is the only
way to command premium prices. To compete, companies must be large
enough to spend hundreds of millions of dollars each year developing
the latest technology.</TE>
<TE>   In doing so, Nvidia, which designs new chips and contracts with
Taiwanese manufacturers, emerged on top after a six-year wave of
consolidation that reduced the ranks of graphics chip makers from
more than 60 companies to little more than half a dozen.</TE>
<TE>   Of those, Nvidia is the undisputed king, with a 60% share of the
market for stand-alone graphics chips on personal computers.</TE>
<TE>   "They're everybody's favorite semiconductor company," said Peter
N. Glaskowski, senior analyst of Cahners In-Stat/MDR in Sunnyvale,
Calif., and senior editor of MicroDesign Resources, an industry
newsletter.</TE>
<TE>   "They have simply put in yet another year of consistent results by
designing exactly what the market wants, delivering it when the
market wants and charging a fair price," Glaskowski said.</TE>
<TE>   It wasn't always that way. Nvidia's first batch of chips in 1995
failed miserably, Glaskowski said. But the company advanced,
eventually setting the standard for speed and performance in 1997
with its Riva line of chips.</TE>
<TE>   The following year, it posted its first profit--five years after
Huang and two fellow engineers founded the company. As computer games
featured increasingly lifelike virtual worlds, consumers gobbled up
PC graphics cards in record volume. Nvidia pummeled  rivals by
putting out a new line of faster chips about every six months.</TE>
<TE>   In 2000, Nvidia won a crucial bid to provide the graphics and
audio chips for Microsoft Corp.'s Xbox game console, which launched
in November and immediately became the must-have tech toy of the
year. The contract, estimated to bring in about $2 billion in revenue
over five years, came with a $200-million prepayment from Microsoft.</TE>
<TE>   The only blemish on the company's record has been a federal
investigation of possible insider trading.</TE>
<TE>   The Securities Exchange Commission in November charged 15 people,
including 10 Nvidia engineers, of illegally trading shares of the
company in 2000 after Huang  circulated an internal memo about
winning the Xbox contract, five days before the deal was publicly
announced.</TE>
<TE>   One engineer left the company, and Nvidia placed the other nine on
unpaid leave pending the outcome of the investigation.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Nvidia is  expanding into markets for graphics chips in
laptops, workstations and consumer electronics. In addition, the
company is vying for a larger piece of the market for graphics
functions on a computer's main chip, an area dominated by Intel.</TE>
<TE>   For Nvidia to continue to please investors, success in these new
markets is key. Nvidia's core market--personal computers--is losing
steam as consumers have been slower to upgrade their PCs.</TE>
<TE>   The Xbox contract is one such vital area. Though not as profitable
as its PC business,  the Xbox deal gives Nvidia enormous cachet in
future endeavors in consumer electronics, analysts said.</TE>
<TE>   "You can only gain so much market share in one product before you
begin to saturate the market," said Hans Mosesmann, managing director
of semiconductor research at Prudential Securities in Menlo Park,
Calif. "The challenge for them is to penetrate new markets as
successfully as they have done with the desktop market."</TE>

<HD>Fund Losses Can Shelter Gains in the Future</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOSH FRIEDMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>There's one upside to the devastating losses many stock mutual funds
have incurred since 2000: A big chunk of any future gains may be
sheltered from taxes.</LD>
<LD>   "Fund investors are at a rare advantage now because the portfolios
have all these losses on their books that can offset future gains,"
said Steve Cohen, chief financial officer at money manager RS
Investments in San Francisco. "It's not the reason you should buy a
fund, but it's an added bonus, a silver lining."</LD>
<LD>   Mutual fund companies can't pass their realized portfolio losses
directly through to investors. But if the funds revive, shareholders
may benefit indirectly as accumulated losses offset newly realized
gains, thus diminishing the likelihood of capital gains
distributions. Funds can carry losses forward for eight years.</LD>
<TE>   Federal law requires mutual funds to distribute any net realized
capital gains (that is, gains in excess of losses) to shareholders
each year. It's a ritual many fund investors abhor--especially in
years when funds' overall portfolio values have declined.</TE>
<TE>   In 2000, many downtrodden funds paid capital gains distributions
in part because appreciated stocks had to be sold to pay off fleeing
investors. That left remaining shareholders with the double whammy of
a tax hit and a drop in their fund's value.</TE>
<TE>   But this year, if the stock market continues to rally, many fund
owners may find the situation reversed: Their fund share price will
rise, yet they won't face capital gains distributions.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, investors who own funds in tax-sheltered accounts, such
as 401(k) plans, don't worry about capital gains payments anyway.</TE>
<TE>   For investors looking to put money to work in taxable accounts,
however, accumulated tax losses can be a significant issue.</TE>
<TE>   Here are some of the funds that might be able to benefit in 2002
and beyond from losses on their books:</TE>
<TE>   * At RS Investments, a notice on the home page (www.rsfunds.com)
alerts investors to losses in several portfolios. RS Contrarian fund,
for example, had a loss as of Dec. 31 of about $18.78 per share, or
186% of the fund's net asset value; RS Emerging Growth had a loss of
$18.23 a share, or 57% of NAV; and RS Diversified Growth, $4.48, or
19% of NAV.</TE>
<TE>   "If you have been thinking about investing in an RS fund or are a
current shareholder and would like to add to your investment," the
notice says, putting a positive spin on a rough market, "this is an
excellent time to take advantage of the current tax-loss
carry-forward situation in some of the funds."</TE>
<TE>   * At Valley Forge, Pa.-based Vanguard Group, several funds have
booked losses, including Vanguard U.S. Growth, with an estimated loss
of more than 40% of the fund's NAV, even though performance has
picked up since a manager change in late June; Vanguard Morgan
Growth, with a loss worth about 20% of NAV; and Vanguard Tax-Managed
Capital Appreciation, with a loss of about 12% of NAV.</TE>
<TE>   "There are no guarantees, of course, when it comes to
distributions, but for someone buying in right now, these cushions
are likely to help insulate them from a tax event for a while," said
Joel Dickson, a Vanguard principal who specializes in tax issues.</TE>
<TE>   * At T. Rowe Price Group Inc. in Baltimore, several funds have
booked losses estimated at more than 10% of NAV, including: T. Rowe
Price Media &amp; Telecommunications, T. Rowe Price Tax-Efficient Growth
and T. Rowe Price Tax-Efficient Multi-Cap Growth. Funds with smaller
losses include T. Rowe Price Growth Stock and T. Rowe Price Mid-Cap
Growth.</TE>
<TE>   Because they absorbed the brunt of the bear market's damage,
growth stock funds generally are sitting on the heaviest losses.</TE>
<TE>   "Most growth funds have a comfortable tax position, and they've
also had two years of dramatic underperformance," said Russ Kinnel,
director of fund analysis at Morningstar Inc. "Altogether, that makes
this an attractive time to consider buying a growth fund, especially
if you're under-represented in that area."</TE>
<TE>   Growth-oriented Van Wagoner Funds in San Francisco and Janus Funds
in Denver are among the other firms with substantial realized losses
in some of their portfolios.</TE>
<TE>   At Invesco Funds in Denver, manager Tim Miller, whose Invesco
Dynamics fund has a loss carry-forward worth about 20% of NAV, said
that gives him "a lot to work with" in terms of tax-efficient trading
strategies.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't want to make light of negative returns," Miller said,
"but for the investor looking at a fund from a fresh perspective, our
sales pitch would be that we've stayed true to our growth discipline,
which has hurt us [relative to our peers], but from the recent
performance you can see that we've fully participated in the market's
recovery, and we're optimistic about the future."</TE>
<TE>   Though Miller's fund lagged behind its mid-cap growth category
average in 2000 and 2001, its longer-term record is better than most,
and it has surged 30% in the last three months.</TE>
<TE>   For investors who own funds in taxable accounts, booked portfolio
losses are only one tax-related factor to consider, experts note. The
fund manager's history of tax efficiency is at least as important,
they say. Tax efficiency refers to a manager's efforts to minimize
annual capital gains distributions either by sticking to a
buy-and-hold philosophy or by deft trading, or both.</TE>
<TE>   Kurt Brouwer, an investment advisor in Tiburon, Calif., said he
would give a fund such as White Oak Growth Stock extra credit because
manager James Oelschlager's history of low turnover and shrewd
trading has generated few capital gains distributions over the years.
The fund now has a loss carry-forward worth roughly 22% of NAV, said
Akron, Ohio-based Oak Associates.</TE>
<TE>   Charles Rinaldi, who took over as manager of the Strong Multi-Cap
Value fund in mid-May, notes that he inherited realized losses from
the previous manager and that he has a strong record of tax
efficiency as manager of Strong Advisor Small Cap Value.</TE>
<TE>   "No promises, but in my opinion there probably won't be any
capital gains distribution in the Multi-Cap fund over the next two
years," Rinaldi said. "I'm a shareholder in both funds, and I
certainly don't want to have to pay any taxes myself."</TE>
<TE>   Vanguard's Dickson suggests that investors read a fund's
prospectus and recent shareholder communications to get a sense of
whether the manager is concerned about tax issues.</TE>
<TE>   "If there's no mention of taxes in the day-to-day management of
the fund, assume any historical tax efficiency is an accident," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   There are other caveats to consider before betting on a fund in
part for its accumulated tax losses. If a fund's assets swell because
the market continues to rally or because investors pile in with new
cash, the per-share value of losses on the books could get watered
down, Dickson said.</TE>
<TE>   Remember too that the first order of business is to find a fund
that meets a specific need in your portfolio, financial advisors say.</TE>
<TE>   The other basic consideration is that an investor must be
confident that a beaten-down fund is in fact poised to rebound. Until
a fund is generating new gains, any accumulated tax losses can't do
shareholders much good.</TE>
<TE>   Said Invesco's Miller: "You never want to make a bad investment
decision for tax purposes."</TE>

<HD>Has the Fox Had Its Last Act?</HD>
<DH>Urban renewal: Efforts to restore Fullerton's 1920s movie palace
continue to bog down. Some see it as the 'last piece of the puzzle' in
reviving downtown.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JERRY HICKS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Ernie Chapman, though just a lad in 1925, vividly recalls the grand
opening of the Fox Theatre in downtown Fullerton that year. His brother
Stanley, who built it, had managed to book members of Broadway's Ziegfeld
Follies, instead of a silent movie.</LD>
<LD>   "How splendid it was," recalled Chapman, now 90.</LD>
<LD>   In those days, the place was called Alicia Court, named after Stanley
Chapman's wife, Alice Ellen. Soon after, it became Mission Court. In
1930, the Fox theater chain took it over. Even so, the Fox--on Harbor
Boulevard just north of Chapman Avenue--reigned for decades as the city's
downtown architectural showpiece.</LD>
<TE>   Now, it's Fullerton's eyesore.</TE>
<TE>   Closed since 1987, the place is a condemned, two-story hulk of plaster
and brick.</TE>
<TE>   The window where ticket takers used to sit in resplendent tuxedos is
coated with grime. A cardboard-covered security gate blocks the front
courtyard where moviegoers once sipped tea. The stone, Greek-inspired
theatrical mask reigning high on the building's front, its eyes once
bulging with colored lights, can be seen now only from across the street.</TE>
<TE>   Despite considerable municipal and private efforts to revive the Fox,
nothing promising is in the works. The message on the Fox's marquee
describes its bleak and needy state: "Available."</TE>
<TE>   While much of downtown Fullerton has seen a resurgence, thanks to
millions in redevelopment funds, the Fox continues to deteriorate. City
officials know it's just getting worse and are renewing their efforts to
save the old building.</TE>
<TE>   "In Fullerton, 2002 has got to be the Year of the Fox," Councilwoman
Jan M. Flory said. "We just can't go on like this."</TE>
<TE>   Efforts to save the Fox have been made before.</TE>
<TE>   "It isn't surprising that my first call back after the holidays is
about the Fox," said Gary Chalupsky, the city's redevelopment director.
"Every other week, somebody inquires about it."</TE>
<TE>   In the late 1990s, a private support group, Fullerton Heritage,
gathered some 15,000 signatures urging that the Fox be saved. Two years
ago, that almost happened.</TE>
<TE>   The city had an option from the owner, Beverly Hills
attorney-businessman Edward Lewis, to take it over. The city began
working with a partnership, headed by developer Doug Chaffee and local
restaurateur Paul Berkman. They had ambitious plans, including serving
food with wine or beer in the theater's balcony. The city agreed to put
in $3 million for a new parking structure.</TE>
<TE>   In the end, the numbers just wouldn't crunch. The city's option ran
out and the deal was scrapped.</TE>
<TE>   "It's just not conceivable," Berkman said. "It would take $4- to $5
million to buy something that doesn't have one thing inside worth
keeping."</TE>
<TE>   Chalupsky agreed. "Every system inside the place needs an overhaul,"
he said.</TE>
<TE>   So Lewis was back where he started. He has since moved to Paris, and
city officials said he hasn't returned the city's telephone calls. (Nor
did his Beverly Hills office return calls from The Times.)</TE>
<TE>   Fullerton Heritage president Tom Dalton said his group wants the city
to take control of the property through eminent domain. But council
members have said they don't want to take a step that drastic.</TE>
<TE>   The city's Redevelopment Agency does have a slick brochure it's
mailing to potential developers "inviting proposals."</TE>
<TE>   The marketing pamphlet states, "The Fox Theatre complex is
strategically located at one of Fullerton's busiest intersections."</TE>
<TE>   But some of the same obstacles exist that led to the Fox's closure 14
years ago. Who's going to open a single-screen theater with limited
downtown parking when there already are so many multiplex theaters in the
area that can handle many cars?</TE>
<TE>   The city has helped upgrade Plummer Auditorium at Fullerton College,
so that undermines the argument that the Fox is needed for stage
productions.</TE>
<TE>   Despite these problems, the Fullerton Downtown Business Assn. wants to
see something done soon. And members prefer that the theater be reborn as
a movie house.</TE>
<TE>   "A theater makes a downtown," association president Martin Ritto said.
"It draws people in. They bring their business with them. In a perfect
world, the Fox would be a theater again."</TE>
<TE>   When Ernie Chapman drives by these days, he thinks back to the
theater's beginnings as Alicia Court. It was a natural for his brother to
build, he said.</TE>
<TE>   The Chapmans were sons of Orange County pioneer C.C. Chapman, who was
the city's first mayor.</TE>
<TE>   Stanley married Alice Ellen Wilber, whose father owned the silent
movie house, the Rialto, at Harbor Boulevard and Wilshire Avenue. Silent
movies and vaudeville were hot in those Roaring '20s days, and the
Chapmans knew a second theater would add profits. The same developers who
built the Egyptian Theater in Los Angeles were hired to build Alicia
Court.</TE>
<TE>   Early newspaper reports describe the building's organ as
"magnificent." It accompanied local productions and played backup to the
movies. Six mammoth murals, three on each of the theater's side walls,
colorfully depicted the Spanish exploration of California.</TE>
<TE>   "I'd go early, before the movie started, just to gaze at those
beautiful murals," Chapman said.</TE>
<TE>   Ten years ago, city officials said, the dilapidated theater wouldn't
have stood out so much. Most of the rest of downtown had a condemned look
too.</TE>
<TE>   But some 90 downtown businesses took advantage of redevelopment loans
to upgrade their buildings, many of which were restored to their original
look. In 1998, Fullerton won the California League of Cities' highest
award for downtown revival. New luxury apartments are planned by the
Morgan Group just down the street from the Fox.</TE>
<TE>   Chad Lowe, executive director of the Fullerton Chamber of Commerce,
calls the Fox problem "the last piece of the puzzle."</TE>
<TE>   Berkman, the restaurateur, said he's no longer interested. But city
officials are hopeful that developer Chaffee may still be able to put
something together. Chaffee could not be reached for comment last week.</TE>
<TE>Restoration Is Possible, but Is Price Worth It?</TE>
<TE>   Councilwoman Flory insists that if the city makes the Fox a priority,
something positive can happen in 2002.</TE>
<TE>   "My husband and I loved the Fox," she said. "Summers, we'd go dressed
almost down to our bathing suits. Winters, we'd take an afghan. I think
the last movie we saw there was "The Terminator."</TE>
<TE>   Experts are certain the building can be restored, even the murals,
which were painted over long ago after deteriorating from age and water
leakage from the roof. The questions are: at what cost, and does
Fullerton really need another theater?</TE>
<TE>   Fullerton Heritage is certain of the answers. In a letter to area
residents, members wrote: "We don't need just another movie theater. We
do need to be responsible caretakers for our city's past."</TE>

<LD>While several hundred wedding guests watched, a man shot and killed
his estranged wife and her current boyfriend, and then apparently turned
the gun on himself at a restaurant in Long Beach, police, witnesses and
relatives said Sunday.</LD>
<LD>   Poly Kree, 41, and her boyfriend, Vichekka Chit, 44, were shot in the
head Saturday night on the same dance floor where Kree married the
assailant, Le Tan Phuc, in December 1999, said Kree's 18-year-old son,
Sokhan Theam. Phuc, 46, then shot himself in the head, witnesses told
police. He died later at a hospital.</LD>
<LD>   A fourth person was shot in the leg and was treated at a hospital,
Long Beach police said.</LD>
<TE>   Witnesses dropped to the floor and then frantically ran out of the
restaurant after the shooting. Police recovered a semiautomatic handgun
at the scene.</TE>
<TE>   "It happened right in front of me," said keyboardist Touch Hon, who
works at La Lune restaurant. "It was terrifying. When the dance floor
cleared, all I could see were the bodies lying down on the floor and lots
of blood."</TE>
<TE>   As restaurant workers cleaned up Sunday, they were also preparing for
another large wedding reception, which went on as scheduled Sunday night
under the glare of television news cameras.</TE>
<TE>   Police spokesman David Marander said investigators would proceed
slowly given that the shooter is also dead. "This is probably at the very
bottom of their rung," he said. "People are dead. It's unfortunate. But
it's a closed case, more or less."</TE>
<TE>   The shooting occurred just before 11 p.m., several hours into a
wedding reception at La Lune, one of numerous Cambodian restaurants in
Long Beach. With up to 50,000 Cambodian residents, Long Beach has the
largest Cambodian population in the world outside the Kingdom of
Cambodia.</TE>
<TE>   Kree, who immigrated with her family in 1985, worked as a welfare
eligibility worker in Compton for the Los Angeles County Department of
Public Social Services, co-worker Vuthana Serey said. Serey sat at Kree's
table Saturday night at the wedding, eating soup, lobster, fish and
dessert.</TE>
<TE>   "It was very wonderful, and everything was going smoothly," Serey
said. The shooter, who was not an invited guest, came in after Kree and
Chit had danced to the first three songs, Serey said.</TE>
<TE>   Serey described his co-worker as quiet, shy and hard-working. Theam, a
student at Cal State Long Beach, said Chit had his mother's name tattooed
on his chest.</TE>
<TE>   "My mom was finally happy for once," he said. "They were a great
couple. They loved to dance and go to weddings and parties. At the same
time, they made sure they took care of us."</TE>
<TE>   But Kree remained threatened by Phuc, her son said. At one point,
Theam said, Phuc showed the family that he had a gun. He then disappeared
for two months, only to reemerge at the wedding. Kree had obtained at
least one temporary restraining order against Phuc, court records show.</TE>
<TE>   "He was just trouble," Theam said. "He would call her many times
threatening to kill her. At one point, he said, 'Your days are up.' "</TE>
<TE>   Witnesses said they noticed Phuc smoking and pacing outside the
restaurant during the reception. When he entered, witnesses reported what
sounded like a balloon popping and then gunshots. After Phuc apparently
shot himself, a security officer handcuffed him because he was still
moving.</TE>
<TE>   The music stopped suddenly and the band later screamed for security
over the microphone.</TE>
<TE>   On Kree's refrigerator was a taped photograph of her three children at
her wedding to Phuc in December 1999. "We're standing on the same dance
floor where my mom was gunned down," Theam said.</TE>
<TE>   Kree also is survived by two other children, Belinda Theam, 14, and
Sokhom Theam, 21. None were fathered by Phuc.</TE>

<HD>Delay of Bond Sale Proves Costly for the State</HD>
<DH>Finance: Some criticize Treasurer Angelides' actions, as a
$12.5-billion deal to repay costs of the energy crisis remains grounded
in a political squabble.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIGUEL BUSTILLO</AU>
<AU>DEBORA VRANA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In the frenzied early days of the energy crisis, Gov. Gray Davis
and California lawmakers gave state Treasurer Phil Angelides an urgent
task.</LD>
<LD>   California was about to burn through billions of dollars buying
electricity to avoid catastrophic mass blackouts. The emergency purchases
were going to punch a huge hole in the state budget. To plug it, the
treasurer would have to orchestrate the biggest municipal bond deal in
American history.</LD>
<LD>   For the ambitious Angelides--a former California Democratic Party
chairman and real estate developer who has made no secret of his desire
to someday be governor--the financing was a chance to claim a central
role in taming the crisis.</LD>
<TE>   He seized the opportunity. In just two weeks last February, following
a speedy selection process, Angelides assembled a large team of bankers
to execute the bond sale. He did it, in part, by tapping former
treasurer's office employees, old friends and political supporters
working in the bond world.</TE>
<TE>   Angelides boldly predicted he would have the bonds sold, and the
budget repaid, as early as last May. Months later, however, the bond
sale, which has since ballooned to $12.5 billion from $10 billion, has
yet to get off the ground. Angelides now says it probably will not happen
until the middle of this year. And what was billed as the pinnacle of
bond deals has instead turned into a costly debacle, for Angelides and
the state.</TE>
<TE>   A squabble among some of the state's top Democratic politicians over
how to handle the financial fallout from the energy crisis continues to
prevent Angelides from being able to sell the bonds. The problem
threatens to plunge the state into a serious fiscal crisis at a time when
it already is wrestling with a major budget shortfall and a faltering
economy.</TE>
<TE>   It has led to a loss of confidence on Wall Street, where influential
investors and credit rating analysts now regard the bond deal as dead in
the water. And it has reignited questions from critics in state
government and the bond business, who wonder whether Angelides picked the
best financial team possible, or allowed politics and personal
relationships to influence the process.</TE>
<TE>   Angelides now says it would have been impossible for him to predict
the problems that have befallen the bond deal. But others say the warning
signs were clear, that some of Angelides' actions caused the state's
financial problems to snowball, and complicate efforts to come up with a
new solution. Notably, critics say, Angelides brokered a $4-billion loan
to help pay for power on the assumption it would be repaid by last
October with proceeds from the bonds.</TE>
<TE>   If Angelides had received better financial advice, some of his critics
say, perhaps he would not have miscalculated on the numerous hurdles the
deal faced and made what turned out to be a bad loan, or a series of
broken promises to investors about when the bonds would go to market.</TE>
<TE>   Angelides selected bankers generally regarded as capable industry
veterans with years of experience in major transactions. Nonetheless,
some regarded his choices as standard operating procedure in a business
where personal connections can make the difference between winning and
losing a spot on a deal, and cronyism and patronage among public
officials have historically been common.</TE>
<TE>   "When I called up to Angelides to find out why we weren't selected, we
were told the bottom line is we aren't up there schmoozing all the time,"
said John Fitzgerald, managing director of Seidler-Fitzgerald, a longtime
Los Angeles firm that the treasurer passed over for the energy bond deal.</TE>
<TE>   Bond financiers frequently shuttle back and forth between state
government and the private sector, making valuable contacts along the
way. Big New York investment banks hire "relationship managers" to cozy
up to California politicians, and even smaller in-state firms employ
lobbyists in Sacramento.</TE>
<TE>   They do so with good reason: Bond work can be extremely lucrative. And
no deal exemplified that more than this one. The underwriters,
accountants and lawyers with a piece of the action are expected to take
in about $100 million in fees for selling the bonds to investors.</TE>
<TE>   For months, the treasurer declined to be interviewed for this story,
deflecting questions to his staff, before agreeing recently to a
15-minute discussion. He also directed the bankers working on the deal
not to speak to the press.</TE>
<TE>   In the interview, Angelides declined to discuss specific underwriters,
but strongly stressed that all 32 investment banking firms that make up
his bond team were chosen purely on merit.</TE>
<TE>   "The way I've operated since I got here is that we hire the firms that
deliver for the state of California, period," Angelides said.</TE>
<TE>   Investment bankers serve an important role in any municipal bond deal.
They help structure the nuts and bolts of the bonds so they are safe and
strong investments, ensuring that buyers have confidence they will be
paid the interest and principal they're owed. They also sell the bonds
through a network of traders, making sure the state or city gets the
lowest interest rate possible, much like a mortgage broker tries to
negotiate the best rate for a new home buyer. And they serve as a sales
force, helping market the bonds to investors and persuade Wall Street
analysts to give the bonds favorable ratings, which can reduce interest
costs by millions of dollars.</TE>
<TE>   The treasurer noted that his team includes 11 of the top 20 municipal
bond firms in the country, as rated by a respected financial information
service. And he pointed out that most of the firms--including many of
those that employ known friends or political supporters of his in
prominent roles--were doing business with California long before he was
elected treasurer in 1998.</TE>
<TE>   "All I can say is that for someone like me, for someone who's been
very active in the civic and financial life of California for . . .
20-some years, that I should know individuals in the financial world
should surprise no one," he said. "You would want your treasurer to know
people and to know people who are in the marketplace."</TE>
<TE>Budget Deficit Could Swell to $18 Billion</TE>
<TE>   California wound up spending more than $6 billion from the state
operating budget to keep the lights on during the energy mess.</TE>
<TE>   If the bond deal does not take place by this summer and state coffers
are not reimbursed for that money, a budget deficit most recently
estimated at $12.4 billion due to the deteriorating economy could swell
to $18 billion or more. That could force Davis and the Legislature to
severely cut important government services such as public education,
welfare and law enforcement, or impose an unpalatable tax increase during
an election year.</TE>
<TE>   Already, California is feeling the financial fallout from the delays.
Last fall, the state missed a deadline to pay back a $4.3-billion loan it
took out to help cover power purchases until the bonds were sold. The
loan was supposed to be repaid with money from the bonds.</TE>
<TE>   The state's failure to pay on time triggered a series of steep
financial penalties and escalating interest rates that will add tens of
millions of dollars to the loan's price tag. California now has to pay it
off in quarterly installments of $390 million plus interest beginning
this spring.</TE>
<TE>'People Are Bored by This Deal Now'</TE>
<TE>   When the bonds finally do go to market, California also will probably
have to pay an interest premium to sell them because the botched loan and
other state actions during the crisis have caused the state's credit
rating to tumble, driving up its borrowing costs. What's more, the energy
bonds probably will have to compete for investor interest this year with
another mammoth financing, a $14-billion New York project to expand the
city's subways.</TE>
<TE>   "People are bored by this deal now. There's too much slippage going
on," said Dave MacEwen, chief investment officer for American Century
Investments, one of many potential buyers that now says it has lost
interest in the deal. "Once again, it keeps getting pushed back and
there's this real sense this deal might never get done."</TE>
<TE>   Angelides says the bond deal's problems are political.</TE>
<TE>   Before the treasurer can float the bonds, he needs the California
Public Utilities Commission to approve a plan to repay them. That is
proving more difficult than Angelides and his financiers anticipated.</TE>
<TE>   The bonds are supposed to be paid off over 10 to 15 years by customers
of the state's big private utilities, the beneficiaries of the power the
state bought, as part of their electric bills for years to come. But the
commission, which regulates electric rates in the state, refuses to
approve the repayment plan because the bonds are caught up in the larger
political dispute among the commission, state Senate leader John Burton
and the Davis administration over the total costs of the crisis.</TE>
<TE>   Angelides says he predicted he could get the deal done because he
believed in pushing to make it happen.</TE>
<TE>   "You know, I could have taken a very different route, but I'm not
going to do it. I could have taken a different route and just said, 'When
all you folks, the administration . . . the PUC, when you get your work
done,' " the treasurer will do his part, Angelides said. "But I think I
have an obligation as does every elected [official] to not only do their
job but try to move the ball along."</TE>
<TE>   Even before the PUC delayed the bond deal, however, critics of the
financial team Angelides selected--including some within the Davis
administration--said it lacked bankers with expert knowledge of the
commission's arcane and time-consuming procedures. If Angelides had
gotten better advice, they contend, perhaps he would not have turned off
investors with failed promises.</TE>
<TE>   Others clearly saw trouble in the making.</TE>
<TE>   "In April, when we cut the state's [credit] rating, we saw these
problems with the PUC, the litigation and the politics coming," said
David Hitchcock, a director with credit rating firm Standard &amp; Poor's
Corp.</TE>
<TE>   PUC President Loretta Lynch and state Controller Kathleen Connell say
Angelides' timetable for selling the bonds was unrealistic from the
start.</TE>
<TE>   Even if the PUC granted all the needed approvals tomorrow, Lynch
believes it still would be months before the bonds could be sold. Parties
have time to appeal the commission's actions administratively, and can
then go to court if they are not satisfied, she said. Pacific Gas &amp;
Electric Co., which went into Bankruptcy Court last spring because of
losses incurred during the energy crisis, has indicated that it may sue
over the PUC's decision on grounds that it would take too big a slice of
electric rates from the utility to pay off the bonds.</TE>
<TE>Bond Industry Knew State Would Need Cash</TE>
<TE>   In their initial response to the energy crisis, California politicians
were not focused on the financial fine print. They were trying to avert
disaster.</TE>
<TE>   California already was experiencing blackouts, and more seemed
imminent. The state's three large private utilities--PG&amp;E, Southern
California Edison and San Diego Gas &amp; Electric--could not afford to
continue supplying their customers. After months of buying power at
exorbitant rates for far more than they could charge consumers under a
state rate freeze, the utilities were billions in debt.</TE>
<TE>   Davis declared a state of emergency last Jan. 17, issuing an executive
order to begin buying electricity. Days later, lawmakers followed with
legislation to more formally put the state in the power business, buying
about one-third of the electricity for three-fourths of the state until
2003, and floating bonds to help pay for it.</TE>
<TE>   It was at that time, Angelides said in the recent interview, that he
realized the magnitude of the financial problem the state faced. The
municipal bond industry apparently realized it sooner. Many banking firms
sent representatives to Sacramento well before the financing plan was
formally announced, since it was common knowledge in the municipal bond
grapevine that California would need a large infusion of cash to overcome
its energy mess.</TE>
<TE>   "We knew that eventually, if the state was going to take over the
purchase of power, it would have to be financed through bonds," said
Napoleon Brandford, a partner with Siebert Brandford Shank, another firm
selected as one of the underwriters. "Like other firms, we submitted
unsolicited proposals and suggestions to the treasurer early on to tell
them about our experience."</TE>
<TE>   Among those making their case in person was Nathan Brostrom, a JP
Morgan banker based in San Francisco. Brostrom has close ties to the
treasurer's office, having worked there in the early 1990s for Kathleen
Brown, the last Democrat before Angelides to hold the job. More recently,
Brostrom has served as an unpaid technical advisor to one of the
investment boards overseen by Angelides' office.</TE>
<TE>   JP Morgan wound up with the choicest slot on the deal, the one with
the greatest responsibility and the greatest share of the bankers' fees.
It was selected to be book-running senior manager, a post from which it
will control the distribution of bonds for sale through the other
underwriting firms. Brostrom, the only banker Angelides has permitted to
comment publicly, declined repeated requests to be interviewed for this
story.</TE>
<TE>   Then came the formal process for winning a piece of the big deal.
Treasurer's officials weeded through the applications, but it was
Angelides who made the final call. Twenty-six firms initially were
selected, about half the number that applied.</TE>
<TE>   Since the original selection last winter, Angelides has added six more
banking firms to help market the mountain of bonds, which would make up
more than 6% of the nation's entire annual municipal bond volume in a
single transaction. He said the additions are not an indication that the
original team was unable to do the job. Rather, he said, he realized the
deal's size required him to cast a wider net than usual and target all
potential bond buyers.</TE>
<TE>   While Angelides and many of the firms chosen tout their experience and
qualifications, a few concede that lobbying also is important.</TE>
<TE>   Sutter Securities, for example, was picked as a first-tier co-manager
on the energy bond, placing it above much larger businesses such as the
Bank of New York. Officials at the firm attribute their success to the
hiring of longtime Sacramento lobbyist Phil Schott as a consultant to
help build relationships in the Capitol.</TE>
<TE>   "When we didn't have a person there, we found we couldn't get any
business at all," said Dennis G. Ciocca, a partner at the firm who
contributed to Angelides in 1998. "We found we needed to have someone to
be in their face."</TE>
<TE>'Pay to Play' Still Occurs Despite SEC Regulations</TE>
<TE>   In 1994, SEC regulators adopted a rule designed to curtail one of the
most controversial aspects of the relationships between investment banks
and politicians: the practice known as "pay to play," in which
underwriters give money to public officials who can award them lucrative
bond work.</TE>
<TE>   Under the regulation, bankers are prohibited from working on a bond
deal for two years if they have contributed more than $250 to the
campaign of an officeholder with power to appoint them to the
transaction.</TE>
<TE>   The rule, however, has many loopholes.</TE>
<TE>   "The intent to influence the process through money is still there,"
said Charles W. "Skip" Fish, the former head of the Municipal Securities
Rulemaking Board, an industry self-regulatory panel. Politicians are
simply "dancing around the flame" by taking donations and awarding work
just outside the time limit, Fish said.</TE>
<TE>   None of the contributions Angelides received from players in the
energy bond deal appears to violate the regulation. While some of the
bankers employed on the bond issue gave money to Angelides' 1998 election
campaign, for example, they all did so within the $250 limit.</TE>
<TE>   However, several appear to illustrate Fish's point. Banking firms are
not necessarily bound by the rule. It only applies to contributions made
by the specific bankers and branches of a corporation that do bond
business. So, to cite one of many examples, Angelides received $5,000
from Bank of America in 1999. But that did not prevent him from hiring
Banc. of America Securities, the company's bond-selling arm, to work on
the energy bond or other bond deals.</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, spouses and relatives are mostly immune, though the rule
does prohibit making contributions through intermediaries. And law firms,
which serve as bond counsel on many big deals, are not covered by the SEC
regulation.</TE>
<TE>   One such firm, Orrick, Herrington &amp; Sutcliffe, has been among the
largest donors to Angelides, with more than $40,000 in contributions last
year. It has a piece of the energy bond deal, working for the Department
of Water Resources, the state agency buying electricity. And its lobbying
arm represents Morgan Stanley, one of the investment banks working on the
deal.</TE>
<TE>   Among the firms selected for the lucrative second-place slot of
co-senior manager was Lehman Bros. One of its main California bankers is
Peter Taylor, a longtime friend and political associate of Angelides.</TE>
<TE>   When Angelides chaired the California Democratic Party in the early
1990s, Taylor worked with him as its finance director. Like Brostrom,
Taylor has provided free technical counsel to a state investment board
overseen by Angelides, and contributed to Angelides' political campaigns.
He did not respond to requests for an interview.</TE>
<TE>   "Lehman Bros. has been one of the most substantial underwriters for
the state of California for years, under Kathleen Brown, under Matt
Fong," Angelides said, naming his Democratic and Republican predecessors.
"They do excellent work and continue to do excellent work for this state.
That I know someone who works for Lehman Bros. should not be a surprise.
I've known Peter Taylor for years."</TE>
<TE>Botched Deal May Hamper Recovery</TE>
<TE>   California's energy storm appears to have passed. Power prices have
plummeted, shrinking the state's electricity costs to a fraction of what
they were last winter. But the financial mess the crisis created still
lingers.</TE>
<TE>   Because the PUC dramatically raised electric rates this year to
account for the inflated market prices, it is now collecting a surplus of
cash from consumers. That money could be used to get California's private
utilities back to financial health faster, and thus allow the state to
exit the power business sooner. It could even allow California to float
less than $12.5 billion in bonds.</TE>
<TE>   But the botched $4.3-billion loan looms over the recovery. The
Department of Water Resources, the state agency buying electricity, now
needs a bigger share of utility rates to make the $390-million quarterly
payments and pay higher interest rates.</TE>
<TE>   To overcome the problem, the state's political leaders agree, they
need to put an end to their infighting and get the bond deal done so the
budget and loan can be repaid. However, some question whether Angelides'
loyalty to his bond team is interfering with a political compromise.</TE>
<TE>   The main lenders on the loan are JP Morgan and Lehman Bros., the same
firms that got the choicest pieces of the bond deal. Angelides, in fact,
said they were selected as underwriters in part because they pledged to
help the state out with the loan. It was no small commitment: JP Morgan
lender Morgan Guaranty put up $2.5 billion, the largest loan in the
firm's history.</TE>
<TE>   Lynch, the PUC president, and Burton, the Senate leader, have promoted
legislation that would allow the state to sell bonds under an alternative
plan. But JP Morgan has opposed the proposal and threatened to sue the
state, arguing the alternative would impair its loan contract.</TE>
<TE>   To Lynch, the investment bank's position appears to be a conflict of
interest and raises questions about whether the bank should be advising
Angelides on ways out of the logjam. The treasurer's office contends the
concerns are unfounded.</TE>
<TE>   "It seems clear that JP Morgan cannot give independent, disinterested
advice on the relative benefits and risks of the different financing
plans that are currently under consideration," Lynch said in a letter to
the treasurer.</TE>
<TE>   Negotiations on the bond deal, after months of being stalled, have now
intensified.</TE>
<TE>   Angelides said he continues to work toward a solution, and to focus on
the future. He refuses to dwell on the past.</TE>
<TE>   "But for the politics of this state, we would have been in the market
at this point, with, I believe, a successful sale," Angelides said. "Now,
we're not there yet. It doesn't do any good to decipher why."</TE>

<HD>Rebirth of Signal Hill</HD>
<DH>Economy: The sleepy oil town transforms itself into booming
shopping district with upscale homes. Now, residents hope to win a
12-year fight for own ZIP Code.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NANCY WRIDE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In Signal Hill, size counts. Being a 2.2-square-mile island
surrounded by a much larger city has left the oil town without an
identity.</LD>
<LD>   Enter the ZIP Code as civic soul.</LD>
<LD>   Until now, the small city with big dreams has shared three ZIP Codes
with parts of Long Beach, which dwarfs it with 49 times more people and
big-city problems like higher crime.</LD>
<TE>   That has cost the working-class community higher insurance premiums,
mistaken utility charges and lost mail--even caused grocery chains to
stay away. City Hall has struggled to collect its full share of sales tax
from the state, which sometimes gives it instead to Long Beach.</TE>
<TE>   More profound than mail snags, residents said in a city survey, the
lack of a ZIP Code has robbed Signal Hill of a sense of place.</TE>
<TE>   "The first thing you get," said longtime Signal Hill Police Capt. Mary
Risinger, "is, 'Where the hell is Signal Hill?' If they know it, they
say, 'Oh, isn't that the city where the black football player died?' "</TE>
<TE>   The city's 12-year effort to get its own five-digit mail address will
culminate when results of a federally mandated postal survey of Signal
Hill mail customers are announced next week.</TE>
<TE>   Signal Hill's is the story of ZIP Code power, not for a Beverly Hills
but for a humble oil town of 9,330 residents. "The little city," said
Mayor Larry Forester, "that could and did."</TE>
<TE>   Striking change has occurred in the city, once made famous as
America's richest oil field and later made notorious by the 1981 jail
death of a college athlete.</TE>
<TE>   The case of Ron Settles tainted the town's image for years, and may
still tarnish it, particularly among African Americans, who comprise 13%
of its population. The remainder, according to the 2000 census: white,
45%; Hispanic, 26%; and Asian, 16%.</TE>
<TE>   The Cal State Long Beach football player was arrested by Signal Hill
police for speeding and booked into the city jail. He was later found
hanged in his cell.</TE>
<TE>   Police insisted that Settles committed suicide. But his family,
represented by attorney Johnnie L. Cochran Jr., won a $760,000 wrongful
death settlement.</TE>
<TE>   Afterward, police commanders left the department and a new chief
cleaned house, Risinger and other officers said.</TE>
<TE>   Still, a reputation lingers among some outsiders that Signal Hill is
mostly oil tanks, roughnecks and rednecks.</TE>
<TE>   Yet startling change is impossible to miss, and not just the African
American city councilman who has served as mayor.</TE>
<TE>   A $1-million estate, other pricey hilltop homes and a Mercedes-Benz
dealership are being built. Signal Hill is among California's top 10
cities for highest per capita sales tax revenue--considered the civic
cash cow--thanks to its thriving auto row, Costco and Home Depot.</TE>
<TE>Hundreds of Wells Still Produce Oil</TE>
<TE>   That Signal Hill lacks strong identity is curious considering its
past. It incorporated in 1924.</TE>
<TE>   Three years earlier, in 1921, the first oil gusher drew 15,000
spectators in a day. The gleeful discovery would turn Los Angeles County
into the world's fifth-largest oil producer. Of about 3,000 wells in
Signal Hill, about 600 remain and continue to produce oil.</TE>
<TE>   Today, Signal Hill remains remarkable, but for different reasons.</TE>
<TE>   Three of its five City Council members are openly gay, although
homosexual rights was not a campaign issue.</TE>
<TE>   That makes Signal Hill one of only three small cities in America with
majority gay city councils, according to the Advocate, a gay-oriented
publication. West Hollywood and Wilton Manors, Fla., are the others.</TE>
<TE>   Signal Hill may have the only U.S. mayor known to have AIDS. Diagnosed
with HIV in 1985 and AIDS in 1994, Forester, a retired engineer who often
worked with ocean oil platforms, ran for office with the aim of
shepherding hilltop development.</TE>
<TE>   "It always irritates me when someone brings up the few negative things
in the past," the New York transplant said with a sigh.</TE>
<TE>   "Yes, they happened, but there is so much else. My guess is that the
city is 20% gay, and clearly if you look at the council, things have
changed. If this isn't a tolerant place, where is?"</TE>
<TE>   The prospect of its own ZIP Code arrives just as Signal Hill seems on
the verge of coming into its own--to the surprise of many.</TE>
<TE>   Ranata and Allen Ralston moved in November from coastal Long Beach to
a trilevel townhouse on the hill. Though smaller, the home has
spectacular ocean views from every room and seems custom designed to
display their substantial art collection.</TE>
<TE>   "When I told my bridge group we were moving to Signal Hill," said
Ranata Ralston, Santa Catalina Island visible out a bedroom window, "They
said, 'Why would you move from the water to the ghetto?' "</TE>
<TE>   She smiles and admits that she initially had to persuade her husband
to consider moving inland.</TE>
<TE>   "People just don't know how it's changed," she said of Signal Hill. "I
think it's still kind of a secret."</TE>
<TE>Geography Hinders Struggle for Identity</TE>
<TE>   For decades, Signal Hill's struggle for an independent identity has
been straitjacketed by geography. How the community came to be surrounded
by Long Beach is, as with most things Signal Hill, the result of its
black gold.</TE>
<TE>   Hundreds of years before drilling began, the slope was populated by
Native Americans, who sent smoke signals from its peak. Historical
references note that even then, oil factored into daily life on the hill.
The Indians used it to waterproof canoes.</TE>
<TE>   Commercial oil drilling changed the community, which had depended on
sheep, cattle and flower farming.</TE>
<TE>   Long Beach began collecting a barrel tax on the oil. When oil company
executives sought relief from the state, they were told that
incorporation was the only way to dodge the tax. And so in 1924, Signal
Hill became a city. The woman who led the cityhood drive, Jessie Nelson,
became the first mayor. Local historians say she was California's first
female mayor.</TE>
<TE>   A grab for remaining oil drilling rights ensued between the cities,
creating Signal Hill's jigsaw shape.</TE>
<TE>   The town has never had the proverbial Main Street, a downtown anchor.
Into that void sprouted world-famous Curley's Cafe, which opened in 1932
to serve oil roustabouts and construction workers.</TE>
<TE>   Curley's sits at the intersection of Signal Hill's past and present.</TE>
<TE>   Out in the parking lot, towering oil derricks ee-ah! loudly. Across
this corner of Cherry Avenue at Willow Street are Costco and Home Depot.
Opposite Curley's is the new Food-4-Less and Starbucks.</TE>
<TE>   The mood is small-town diner. If you want to see almost anyone in
town, come here. A typical cast of customers one recent morning includes
silver-haired oil men, younger cops, the mayor, the town historian,
old-coot gadflies and newcomer contractors, in town to build the
mansions.</TE>
<TE>   Glancing at a mug covered by a rainbow, 77-year-old Robert Lee, an
oilman from Shreveport, La., cracks a joke. "Oh," he says with a wink,
"you got the fruity cup." The waitress chides him and says, "You're
surrounded by gay folks, so what's the big deal?" Lee shrugs. "No big
deal actually," he says. "I'm just not one of 'em. Don't really matter to
me."</TE>
<TE>   While gays may not be championed in every quarter, a live-and-let-live
tolerance prevails, Forester said. He speculates that Signal Hill's
spectacular views have attracted gay residents. Also, he said, Signal
Hill is close to Long Beach, which has at least 20 gay bars and a large
gay population.</TE>
<TE>   It is not that, but growth on the hill, gossip and ZIP Code gripes
that pepper the diner's din.</TE>
<TE>   The city government expects it will get its ZIP Code. A 1997 city
survey returned by 22% of Signal Hill mail customers showed 75% in favor.
Results of the current federal postal survey, a mandatory assessment
before any ZIP Code actions are taken, will be announced Jan. 15.</TE>
<TE>   Those mail customers who oppose a changed ZIP Code point to the cost
of replacing stationery, invoices and advertising. Many of the car
dealerships already use Long Beach in their signs anyway because more
people know where it is.</TE>
<TE>   Signal Hill leaders have lobbied for the ZIP Code for 12 years. The
U.S. Postal Service repeatedly denied the city's plea, citing Signal
Hill's lack of a post office. Each ZIP Code requires one, said Long Beach
Postmaster Ed Jenkins.</TE>
<TE>Much Resistance to New ZIP Code</TE>
<TE>   The city offered property on which to build itself a post office. For
a variety of reasons, those deals fell through. The powerful union
representing the 600 mail carriers in the Long Beach area also resisted
the ZIP Code change because it would disrupt so many routes in a
complicated seniority system.</TE>
<TE>   Given all that, it startled many involved when the U.S. postmaster
general ordered the new Signal Hill postal survey last month.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. Rep. Steve Horn (R-Long Beach), who had spent a decade fighting
for the ZIP Code, met with the postmaster general for anthrax discussions
and only in passing mentioned the Signal Hill matter.</TE>
<TE>   Jenkins said the postmaster general decided that an existing mail
distribution center could be used for Signal Hill's mail--at least for
the time being. The union and Jenkins believe a new facility costing up
to $4 million may be required, but many details remain to be worked out.</TE>
<TE>   "When a miracle happens," City Manager Ken Farsing said, laughing,
"You don't ask why."</TE>

<HD>Balancing Budget Is Risky Job for Davis</HD>
<DH>Politics: The governor considers legislators, rivals, voters in
crafting a plan that remedies state's $12-billion deficit--all without
raising taxes.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JULIE TAMAKI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO
</DL>
<LD>Facing the threat of a $12-billion deficit at the same time he
tries to orchestrate his reelection, Gov. Gray Davis unveils a state
budget this week that will be as much about politics as spending.</LD>
<LD>   Contained within the pages of the purple, telephone book-sized
document are the governor's policies, ranging from how much money the
state should spend on each public school student to whether it can keep
paying for breast cancer treatment and helping the poor with their energy
bills.</LD>
<LD>   With elections approaching and the state running short of cash, Davis
faces the tough task of staking out his policies without giving political
opponents fresh fodder or alienating fellow party members and
constituents.</LD>
<TE>   From the right, three GOP gubernatorial opponents are hammering Davis'
handling of California's finances. Along with Republican lawmakers, they
have found fault with the Democratic governor's response to the energy
crisis and the growth of state government under his tenure.</TE>
<TE>   Davis faces another set of hurdles from the left. He must figure out a
way to appease fellow Democrats who rule California's Legislature and
still persuade them to approve spending cuts of nearly $3 billion, maybe
more.</TE>
<TE>   It will be a tough sell given that Senate Leader John Burton (D-San
Francisco) believes that raising taxes is a better way to attack the
deficit than cutting services for the poor. He stepped up the pressure
last week by proposing a $2.5-billion annual income tax increase for the
wealthiest Californians.</TE>
<TE>   "Politics is a matter of luck and timing, and for Davis, the timing
couldn't be worse," said Sherry Bebitch Jeffe, who teaches political
science at USC. "Voters are not happy about having programs cut or taxes
raised. It's a rule of thumb."</TE>
<TE>   The Davis administration had made clear that it planned to balance the
budget primarily by cutting spending, refinancing debt and borrowing--as
opposed to raising taxes. In fact, Davis made it clear at a press
conference Saturday that he has no intention of calling for any increase
in taxes.</TE>
<TE>   Lawmakers will join the process with their own ideas.</TE>
<TE>   But for now, anticipation is building for Thursday's presentation of
Davis' 2002-03 budget proposal. Although the administration closely
guards the details, clues have emerged about how the governor may seek to
close the $12-billion deficit and about an array of other fiscal tools at
his disposal.</TE>
<TE>   * Cuts and delays:</TE>
<TE>   The largest chunk of savings Davis has acknowledged he is counting on
comes from the roughly $3 billion in cuts and spending deferrals he
proposed in November. The bulk of the reductions would fall on one-time
expenditures, and more than a third would hit the governor's pet cause:
education.</TE>
<TE>   Proposals to delay a $200-million plan to assist struggling students
and another expanding a health insurance program for poor children have
received a particularly chilly reception from Democratic lawmakers, whose
approval Davis needs to carry out the trims.</TE>
<TE>   * Freeing up cash:</TE>
<TE>   Getting creative with its cash flow is another tactic the state can
employ to deal with a deficit. By restructuring its contributions to the
California Public Employees' Retirement System, for example, the state
could free up about $1 billion during the 2002-03 fiscal year. Under a
plan approved by the CalPERS board, the state would agree to repay the
money over the next 30 years and bolster inflation protection for current
and future retirees beginning in 2005.</TE>
<TE>   The state could knock another $1 billion off the deficit by taking
advantage of low interest rates to refinance its general obligation
bonds, as Treasurer Phil Angelides proposed last week. Davis' finance
officials say they are examining ways to reorganize state debt.</TE>
<TE>   Restructuring either the bonds or the CalPERS contributions would
leave the state with more cash to deal with the deficit, but would put
pressure on its coffers in future years. The state could save another $2
billion, according to one estimate, by borrowing against its annual share
of tobacco settlement money over the next five years.</TE>
<TE>   Advocates for the poor, meanwhile, fear that the governor will propose
freezing cost-of-living adjustments for health and welfare programs--a
move that could save the state hundreds of millions of dollars. Local
governments are equally concerned that state officials will skimp on
reimbursements owed to cities and counties.</TE>
<TE>   * Federal aid:</TE>
<TE>   Davis may count on money he expects California to receive from the
federal government to help close the deficit. The National Governors
Assn. has asked Congress to give states at least $3 billion to respond to
bioterrorism threats and to cover security costs. The association is also
urging the federal government to increase its share of Medicaid costs to
help states deal with budget shortfalls. Davis could ask for more federal
help to pay the incarceration costs of illegal immigrants in California
prisons.</TE>
<TE>   * Reform:</TE>
<TE>   The Davis administration has considered overhauling a variety of
programs to save money. They include job training, juvenile justice and
substance abuse programs.</TE>
<TE>   Administration officials have indicated that the governor will
introduce a plan to revamp child care programs. The aim is to keep rising
costs in check and to aid more struggling families.</TE>
<TE>   Rumors abound that additional reforms could focus on bolstering
teacher training and improving fiscal accountability at schools by
holding chief financial officers to higher certification standards.</TE>
<TE>   * Raising revenue:</TE>
<TE>   Finally, though Davis has said he believes he can present a balanced
budget that does not include tax increases, health and safety advocates
may ask voters in November to approve a quarter-cent sales tax increase
to raise about $1 billion annually for anti-terrorism expenses.</TE>
<TE>   A tax increase would reduce pressure on Davis to pull together
additional funds for that purpose.</TE>
<TE>   Democratic lawmakers are also seeking to roll back or suspend a
popular tax cut enjoyed by motorists. The proposal, which would save the
state about $4 billion a year, has put members of the business community,
who by their own estimate pay for about a third of the vehicle license
fees, on edge.</TE>
<TE>   "We are afraid there will be a big push for a tax increase to solve a
problem," said Fred Main, senior vice president and general counsel for
the California Chamber of Commerce. "The business community is generally
the first group to be looked at."</TE>
<TE>Tax Increase OK if Services Preserved</TE>
<TE>   Others, however, are amenable to a tax increase if it means that
services can be preserved or expanded as previously planned.</TE>
<TE>   "When you look at trade-offs between making progress for families and
some fairly minor fee increases, people are open to the increases," said
Jim Keddy, executive director of the PICO California Project, a
faith-based group that advocates for the poor.</TE>
<TE>   Another revenue-enhancement option: Begin charging or increasing a
variety of fees, including one aimed at primarily public and teaching
hospitals that serve a disproportionate number of poor patients.</TE>
<TE>   The conflicting pressures facing Davis guarantee to cast a spotlight
on the state budget-making process, an arcane and traditionally low-key
exercise. Analysts predict a rocky road ahead for the governor.</TE>
<TE>   "I think he's going to have a tough time because of the political
constraints during an election year," said Jean Ross, executive director
of the California Budget Project, a nonprofit research and advocacy
group. "My fear is that people will be looking to leverage partisan
interests over a cooperative solution for the budget."</TE>
<TE>   Lawmakers will dissect Davis' spending proposal in coming months,
using it as the starting point for their own budget plans. Meanwhile,
Davis will get a better sense of how the state's finances are shaping up
after personal income tax receipts come due in April.</TE>
<TE>   Armed with the fresh financial data, he'll present a revised budget in
May. That in turn will become fodder for the budget conference committee
the Legislature typically convenes each spring. The committee puts out a
compromise budget that is debated in each house of the Legislature and
usually results in negotiations between legislative leaders from both
parties and the governor's administration.</TE>
<TE>   The Legislature's frequently missed deadline for approving the budget
is June 15, and Davis faces a July 1 deadline for signing the document.</TE>
<TE>   For their part, Davis administration officials are counting on
cooperation from lawmakers to help balance the budget.</TE>
<TE>   "No single person can close a $12-billion budget gap by themselves,"
said Susan Kennedy, Davis' deputy chief of staff and secretary of his
Cabinet. "We all have to work together to address a problem of that
size."</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps, but arguably no politician has as much at stake as the
governor.</TE>
<TE>To Get Reelected, Davis Mindful of Constituents</TE>
<TE>   Davis has to worry about getting reelected this year, which means he
must maintain a high profile as California's top leader and problem
solver. Perhaps that is why, even as the state is experiencing softening
revenues, he has continued to scrape together money for various
constituents and causes.</TE>
<TE>   Just last month, he announced a $1-million tax break for the
agricultural community, plans to provide $5 million to county health
departments to fight bioterrorism and nearly $19 million in federal funds
to extend child care benefits for certain former welfare recipients. He
also scrapped an unpopular proposal last week to dash $25 million in
funding for trauma care centers.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, lawmakers will be pushing their own agendas.</TE>
<TE>   "It's going to be difficult," said state Sen. Steve Peace, the El
Cajon Democrat who heads the Senate Budget Committee. "The biggest part
of the difficulty is going to be dealing with term-limited legislators in
an election year."</TE>

<LD>Let's look at it from Dale Atkeson's point of view.</LD>
<LD>   The guy plays pro football for the Washington Redskins in the 1950s,
scores a rookie touchdown on a 99-yard kickoff return, and rides through
the twilight 40 years later in a little Toyota pickup with a plate that
says "1 REDSKN."</LD>
<LD>   There he is in Manhattan Beach now, 71 years old, and it's been seven
years since wife Wanda sprung the vanity plate on him as a Christmas
present.</LD>
<TE>   Then one day before Christmas past Dale opens a letter from the DMV,
which is never a good idea, and finds out the "1 REDSKN" has got to go
because it's been deemed racially offensive.</TE>
<TE>   In a culture that's ever-more crude and indecent, the long arm of the
law had reached past Howard Stern, hard-core gangster rap, and prime-time
sex to whack Dale Atkeson for innocently celebrating a brief moment of
his own history. All it took was one complaint by an American Indian, and
suddenly the DMV was more efficient than you've ever seen it, as my
colleague Peter Hong reported in Friday's Times.</TE>
<TE>   Forget the Delta commandos and the rest of the troops that have been
sniffing after Osama bin Laden in caves. We should have sent the
California DMV after him.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not gonna hire no lawyer," says Atkeson, who figures he's got a
better chance of returning a kickoff in this year's Super Bowl than
winning his appeal to DMV bureaucracy. "My main idea was to just complain
about this political correctness stuff."</TE>
<TE>   Dale's wife, Wanda, who may get the next DMV target letter (her
license plate is "RDSKN2"), is right behind him on that. With all that's
wrong in the world, she says, who would go through the trouble to chase
after a 70-something guy in a Toyota?</TE>
<TE>   Wanda says she and Dale are afraid to take their grandchildren to the
movies, they're so worried about the offensive language and carryings-on
the youngsters might be subjected to. How many kids, by comparison, are
going to be corrupted when Dale hits the streets of Manhattan Beach in
his pickup?</TE>
<TE>   "It's too bad these people have so much time on their hands," Wanda
says. I assumed she was referring to American Indians, but maybe it was
the DMV. Or both. "And it's a shame they couldn't put it toward something
more productive."</TE>
<TE>   Makes sense to me. But we've only heard one side of the story, so I
got hold of the guy who made the complaint. And now let's look at Dale
Atkeson's "1 REDSKN" plate from Eugene Herrod's point of view.</TE>
<TE>   Herrod, 50, is a retired private investigator living in Buena Park.
He's a descendant of a Muskogee-Creek family from Oklahoma, and he's
hooked up with Advocates for American Indian Children, crusading to
enlighten the public on slurs.</TE>
<TE>   "If you're familiar with the etiology of the term redskin, its
derivative is when bounties were collected on American Indians," Herrod
says. "The bloody scalp was referred to as the redskin."</TE>
<TE>   The DMV banned Redskin derivatives in 1999 after a complaint by
Herrod, and the ban withstood three appeals. In one, a judge found a
"REDSKIN" vanity plate offensive to good taste and decency.</TE>
<TE>   In November, Herrod found Atkeson's "1 REDSKN" while scrolling the DMV
Web site and filed the complaint that got the dogs barking after the
former football player.</TE>
<TE>   "You wouldn't call the Washington team the Wetbacks, would you?"
Herrod asks. "Would you have the Brownskins, the Blackskins, or the
Atlanta Negroes?"</TE>
<TE>   Herrod says he doesn't suspect Atkeson means any ill will with his
license plate. But he's not inclined to let him off the hook, regardless.</TE>
<TE>   "A racial slur is a racial slur, and when people are enlightened, they
won't be as inclined to make them. Martin Luther King said it best when
he said the most dangerous thing is sincere ignorance."</TE>
<TE>   Bigotry endures in a thousand ways in America, and Herrod's
intolerance of it is certainly commendable. But he doesn't speak for all
American Indians on the subject of what is and is not a slur. Cal
Codynah, of the Southern California Indian Center, says he's on Herrod's
side and believes most of the community is. "But some have said they see
Redskins as a source of pride, back to when the team was in its heyday.
And others say who cares, big deal, let's move on to other issues."</TE>
<TE>   In Washington, D.C., the Wizards used to be the Bullets, but some
people thought the bullet was a negative image. I don't know whether, on
a hot summer day along the Potomac, polite people are now inclined to say
someone is sweating wizards. But whose standard are we supposed to use in
deciding what's insensitive, and do we really want to ban everything that
might be offensive to anybody?</TE>
<TE>   If so, how far back should we go? Should statues of George Washington
come down because he owned slaves?</TE>
<TE>   If the nation's capital can have an NFL franchise called the Redskins

<HD>Report Deals a Blow to Suburbs</HD>
<DH>Environment: CDC researchers find health suffers due to urban
sprawl and dependency on cars. Home builders dismiss study, funded by
slow-growth advocates.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>EVAN HALPER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Warning: Suburban living may be killing you.</LD>
<LD>   So say top environmental health experts at the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention. Suburbanites don't burn the calories others do
walking or biking places, the theory goes, because poor urban design
forces them to sit in their cars to go anywhere.</LD>
<LD>   There's far from universal agreement on the study. Other analysts at
the CDC have reported that there is no better place to live than the
suburbs if you want to be healthy.</LD>
<TE>   But the study's conclusions have certainly struck a nerve.</TE>
<TE>   "Calling this 'junk science' is too complimentary," said Laer Pearce,
a Laguna Hills-based spokesman for the Southern California Building
Industry Assn. "It is just junk."</TE>
<TE>   Home builders are angrily denouncing the report, released in the fall.
They note that it came on the heels of an earlier CDC study that
concluded that those who dwell in their master-planned neighborhoods are
pillars of good health.</TE>
<TE>   Scientists are just beginning to turn their attention to sprawl as a
public health issue. But they're already advising that they will have
plenty more to say as they look closer at the health effects of what they
consider poor urban planning.</TE>
<TE>   Richard Jackson, the CDC's top environmental health expert, wrote the
controversial report with colleague Chris Kochtitzky. The research was
funded by Sprawlwatch, a Washington, D.C.-based slow-growth advocacy
group.</TE>
<TE>   It's that alliance which has provoked much of the ire of home
builders.</TE>
<TE>   Jackson makes no apologies. Sprawlwatch offered to fund what he
considered a long-overdue paper. He and Kochtitzky are now writing a book
on the public health consequences of unmanaged growth, which he says
Americans too often "ignore at our peril."</TE>
<TE>   Consider, he says, a study showing that the average person living in
Washington, D.C., walks 10,000 steps a day. "You cannot do that living in
a place like Orange County," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The report is filled with similar examples. One study cited suggests
that students are four times more likely to be able to walk to schools
that were built before 1983. The authors say newer schools are built on
the fringes of developments and are often designed in ways that make them
inaccessible to walkers and cyclists. Another study shows that children
walked or biked for nearly 16% of all the trips they made in 1977. Twenty
years later, it was down to 10%.</TE>
<TE>   "This is not yet a smoking gun," Jackson said. "It is a policy piece.
We're putting forward hypotheses and thinking about how these things
contribute to the public health.</TE>
<TE>   "Our goal is to make home builders realize they can have a tremendous
impact," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Environmentalists have warned for years about the unintended health
effects of low-density, auto-dependent communities. The American Lung
Assn. has issued some reports about the dangers of sprawl-induced air
pollution. But the move to link sprawl to deteriorating health turned a
corner in November when slow-growth advocates announced that CDC experts
were on board.</TE>
<TE>   The findings are ironic. Americans initially flocked to the suburbs to
get outdoors, breath fresh air and leave the pollution and lack of green
space in the big cities behind. Now experts warn that the suburbs have
become so auto-oriented that walking to the store is often near
impossible, and open space preservation is not keeping pace with growth.</TE>
<TE>   "People assume the suburban lifestyle is inherently more healthy,
largely because of access to nature," said William Fulton, a land-use
expert and author of books about urban growth in California. "But the
suburbs aren't like that anymore. People have small yards and they are
surrounded by traffic.</TE>
<TE>   "There is a big difference between living in a bucolic suburb of the
1950s and living in Orange County today," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The impact of urban design on public health began to intrigue Jackson
during his 20 years as a state epidemiologist and environmental health
director in California.</TE>
<TE>   "Talk to people on the street in Orange County about the environment
and they will tell you there is nowhere nearby for their children to
play, there is not enough green space in walking distance, they can't get
anywhere without getting in a car, and if they want to go downtown they
have to sit in traffic for an hour and a half," Jackson said.</TE>
<TE>   Yes, people are getting out of shape because they just don't exercise,
the authors acknowledge. But they say the two main reasons people give
for not exercising are lack of accessible places to exercise and concerns
about safety in the places that do exist.</TE>
<TE>   One section of the report discusses the increasing number of
pedestrians and bicyclists being hit by cars. Most of these accidents
occur in sprawling new developments with inadequate sidewalks and
crosswalks, according to statistics.</TE>
<TE>   The authors also contend that "many different types of urban design
encourage sedentary living habits."</TE>
<TE>   They propose subbing in high-density developments with a mix of homes,
stores and office space that allow for fully integrated, racially and
economically diverse walkable communities. Cramped lawns get traded in
for community parks and trails in close proximity to everyone.</TE>
<TE>   "While older cities and towns were planned and built based on the
practical idea that stores and services should be within walking
distances of residences, the design of most new residential areas
reflects the supposition that people will drive to most destinations,"
the report says.</TE>
<TE>Home Builders: Study Follows Political Agenda</TE>
<TE>   Home builders say such statements prove that the authors are pandering
to the agenda of Sprawlwatch.</TE>
<TE>   "This report is a ludicrous sham," said Pearce, of the Southern
California Building Industry Assn. "Why are CDC resources being used to
move a political agenda?"</TE>
<TE>   That view is echoed by builders nationally.</TE>
<TE>   "The authors seem less inclined to debate the fundamental issues of
growth than to try to regulate lifestyles," said Bruce Smith, president
of the National Assn. of Home Builders, in a written statement.</TE>
<TE>   "We'll all be better off if [the CDC] stick to what they do
best--fighting physical diseases, not defending political ones," Smith
said, adding that surveys consistently show that homeowners do not want
to live in dense, mixed-use neighborhoods.</TE>
<TE>   The CDC's own findings, according to the home builders association,
undermine Jackson's report. Smith points to an official CDC study
released in September that says suburbanites are the healthiest people in
the country, exercising more and living longer than residents of rural
and urban areas.</TE>
<TE>   "Will the real CDC please step forward?" Smith said.</TE>
<TE>   Jackson says the earlier report is skewed by the many affluent people
in the suburbs with access to top health insurance, gym memberships and
homes near bike trail networks. He points out that opportunities to
exercise without driving somewhere are falling out of reach for most
low-income families as well as an increasingly large portion of the
middle class and the elderly as green space disappears in the suburbs.</TE>
<TE>   "We are designing environments that actually restrict people's
options," he said. "We need to be offering people options to take charge
of their health."</TE>
<TE>   While the home builders advise CDC officials to stick to matters of
toxins and treatments, many urban planning experts say now is the time
for the public health community to step into the sprawl debate.</TE>
<TE>   "These are interesting discussions to have," said Scott Bollens, chair
of urban and regional planning at UC Irvine. "For years people talked
about sprawl increasing travel time. This is an attempt to talk more
specifically about what it does to human physical and psychological
well-being. It is really trying to look at what urban development
patterns do to the individual."</TE>

<DH>Health: Budding teenage singer, who rediscovered life while
recovering from cancer, performs in comedy revue.</DH>

<AU>STEVE CHAWKINS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As she slinks across the cafeteria floor in tight turquoise pants,
purple spangled halter top and silver high heels, the 17-year-old blond
diva warbles a la Britney Spears.</LD>
<LD>   "My singin's kinda off-key--</LD>
<LD>   To make matters worse, I'm on MTV . . ."</LD>
<TE>   Hamming it up like everyone else at the dress rehearsal of Santa
Susana High School's annual comedy revue, Alex Nester vamps and glides
through her over-the-top Britney impression.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, the music had to come to her. Friends serenaded the Simi
Valley girl as she lay in a hospital bed, exhausted from another round of
chemotherapy. A performer whose first professional credit was a yogurt
jingle at the age of 9, she was on the road to a high-powered singing
career when she was diagnosed with lymphoma. Ravaged and then revived by
chemotherapy, she lost her hair, her sweet voice and, very nearly, her
will to go on.</TE>
<TE>   But that was then. Now, coiffed with an elaborate blond wig, Alex is
just another player, just another starburst of adolescent energy bouncing
off the walls as students prepare for Saturday's production of "Got
Comedy?" at the Civic Arts Plaza in Thousand Oaks. They'll also perform
at the school on Feb. 1 and 2.</TE>
<TE>   At rehearsal, director Peggy Albrecht chides a mumbler for his lack of
gusto.</TE>
<TE>   "You don't just tell the audience, 'Listen up,' " she reminds him.
"It's: Listen up! You want to wake up that guy dozing in the fourth row!
Hit 'em over the head with it!"</TE>
<TE>   Albrecht, an animated woman who peppers her conversation with
exclamations, conceived the show as a fund-raiser for the school in 1997.
Each year, she writes a new version of it and directs a couple dozen
eager players. A seasoned performer herself, she teaches a class in
improvisation at Santa Susana, a magnet school in Simi Valley for
technology and the performing arts.</TE>
<TE>   For Albrecht, an actress who also wrote some failed sitcoms, this is a
labor of love. She tells stories of shy students who blossom, and morose
students who rise above their bleakness on a wave of self-confidence.</TE>
<TE>   "These kids aren't athletes or necessarily A students," she said.
"They don't have a clique, but all of a sudden they find themselves in a
place where they're welcomed with open arms. A lot of them come in and
go, 'I'm not funny.' I tell them, 'That's my job; when I get through with
you, you'll be funny.' "</TE>
<TE>Success Followed by Grim Diagnosis</TE>
<TE>   For Alex Nester, funny sometimes has been a hard state to attain over
the last few years.</TE>
<TE>   By the time she was 16, she was featured on eight CDs and had earned
honors at the Los Angeles Music Awards.</TE>
<TE>   But she was overcome with fatigue. She lost her appetite. Last
February, she thought she'd pulled an abdominal muscle in a hip-hop
class, but she and her parents soon realized it was something much worse.</TE>
<TE>   "I started feeling nauseous and it hurt like crazy," she recalled. "It
went on for a couple of weeks, and then it got so bad I couldn't stand it
anymore."</TE>
<TE>   The diagnosis: Life-threatening pancreatitis triggered by lymphatic
cancer.</TE>
<TE>   "I was scared out of my mind and feeling terrible at the same time,"
she said. "It was a real head trip."</TE>
<TE>   Students and teachers from Santa Susana--known affectionately as Santa
Sue--dropped by Alex's hospital room, and friends showed up with guitars.
Even so, her spirits flagged, sapped by the powerful drugs that burned up
her cancer.</TE>
<TE>   "Depression was the worst part," she said. "I was crying the whole
time. I just couldn't find reason in life. Logically, I shouldn't have
felt like that, but I did."</TE>
<TE>   Bolstered by antidepressants, Alex reentered school gradually,
focusing at first on dance to help regain her strength.</TE>
<TE>   "She literally dragged herself here, huffing and puffing through dance
class and then sitting down and crying through sheer exhaustion,"
Albrecht said. "There's not a person in the world I admire more."</TE>
<TE>   At rehearsal, Albrecht is unrelentingly upbeat as she puts 27 students
and 15 alumni through their paces.</TE>
<TE>   "And you don't say, 'Henny Young-Man,' " she tells a cast member who
paused between the syllables of the comic's name. "It's 'Youngman.' He
was an old guy. He wasn't a young guy. 'Henny Young-Man!' Omigod! It
sounds so waspy!"</TE>
<TE>Show Honors Great Comics</TE>
<TE>   The production offers wacky glimpses of comedy and music through the
decades, paying homage to Youngman, Milton Berle and Jerry Seinfeld while
lampooning such pop wonders as the Village People, Cher and 'N Sync.</TE>
<TE>   During a break from the rehearsal's focused zaniness, Alex recounts
what she can remember of her return to health. Some of it is hazy; the
chemo, she says, played tricks with her memory. What she knows for sure
is that her spirit and voice had both been wounded--and that both had
come back strong.</TE>
<TE>   "For a while, I could barely talk, no less sing," she says. "My
voice--this one thing in life that always made me smile--was in limbo."</TE>
<TE>   Now she has two CDs in the works--one Christian, the other
contemporary. For Christmas, she recorded a jazzy single--"Thank You (To
All My Friends)"--and sent it to 300 of the pals, teachers, doctors,
nurses and family members who helped during her ordeal.</TE>
<TE>   But as she and the other players go through their antic gyrations, all
that is behind her. The only sign of her ordeal sits on her head--an
outrageous Britney Spears hairpiece.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a good thing I got these wigs," she says.</TE>

<LD>The White House was assiduously not playing favorites in the past
weekend's presidential town hall event in Ontario--heck, even Gov. Gray
Davis was invited. But California's three Republican gubernatorial
candidates nonetheless were eager for some First Face-time, or just
getting in the same film-frame with George W. Bush, hoping that a little
bit of Pennsylvania Avenue pixie dust might rub off on them.</LD>
<LD>   All three attended the Bush event, but Bill Simon's press release
beforehand was ambitiously headlined, "Simon to Join President George W.
Bush for Town Hall Meeting," which is technically correct but rather on
the same order of hopefulness as a headline reading, "Dodger Dog Vendor
to Join Hideo Nomo at Dodger Stadium."</LD>
<TE>Man Oh Man of the Year</TE>
<TE>   Oh sure, that weekly publication gave its annual honors to the
now-ex-mayor of New York, Rudolph William Giuliani.</TE>
<TE>   But another weekly publication had a different politician in mind for
its plaudits:</TE>
<TE>   Gary A. Condit.</TE>
<TE>   (The A stands for Adrian, and the adjective "embattled" has now
evidently been permanently prefixed to his full name.)</TE>
<TE>   The Cleveland Free Times, the alternative weekly newspaper for
Athens-on-the-Cuyahoga, has bestowed upon the Modesto congressman its own
honors as "Times Man of the Year" because, as it detailed:</TE>
<TE>   "Gary Condit is the quintessence of a gluttonous society operating
without fear or consequence, content to distract itself with inanities.
We've become a society as rich in hypocrisy as we are in resources (i.e.,
the media covers only Gary Condit because that's what people want to
watch; people watch endless Gary Condit because that's what the media
covers). The terror attacks instantly exposed the story for what it was:
a meaningless tale of sound and fury writ large by power, sex and
(presumably) death . . . how embarrassing that this will forever be the
'before' picture to the exploding twin towers' 'after' picture. . . .
Supposedly [the attacks] spelled the death of irony, but the real irony
is that it did nothing of the kind: Gary Condit is running for
reelection."</TE>
<TE>   Yes, yes--but does that mean they won't be endorsing him for
reelection?</TE>
<TE>Your Excellency, Take a Bow, Por Favor</TE>
<TE>   Everything but the glass slipper.</TE>
<TE>   Left far behind newly appointed Ambassador to Spain George Argyros was
the embarrassing little contretemps, long since settled, that doubters
said might have kept him from this moment in Madrid--that flap over
whether his company, the largest apartment owner in Orange County,
illicitly pocketed tenants' security deposits.</TE>
<TE>   A dozen days before Christmas, the Orange County businessman, who is
studying the language of the country where he was named U.S. ambassador,
formally presented his credentials at the court of the King of Spain in
Madrid.</TE>
<TE>   In white tie and tails, Argyros was conveyed by horse-drawn carriage,
escorted by Spanish police and U.S. Embassy personnel, to Madrid's Plaza
Mayor, and thence to the Palacio de Oriente. He ascended the steps of the
palace to be announced not by name but by job title. (Being ambassador to
Spain also makes Argyros ambassador to Andorra, the principality in the
Pyrenees know for its shopping: The country about 2.5 times the size of
Washington, D.C., brags of having 4,800 shops.)</TE>
<TE>   Argyros' new job pays $145,000 a year, and he is expected to dip into
his own billion or so to keep up appearances.</TE>
<TE>   Argyros' career took him from his Detroit birthplace, where he worked
in a grocery store, to owning a strip mall in Tustin, manufacturing
igloo-shaped doghouses, and owning the Seattle Mariners and Air Cal
airline, to one of Forbes' "400 richest" list, to raising money for
George W. Bush's presidential campaign, and now to the court of King Juan
Carlos. Argyros praised the monarch as having done "a wonderful job as
king. . . . I certainly have a better understanding" of that regal role
and the nation, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Argyros spent some time thereafter in discussion with the king and the
Spanish foreign minister; Atty. Gen. John Ashcroft was there the same day
to thank Spain for helping the U.S. in its battle against terrorism, and
to offer Spain a hand in taking on its own home-grown problems with
violent Basque separatists.</TE>
<TE>   There is no word on whether Argyros bowed to the man who occupies the
venerable throne of Ferdinand and Isabella. In the 1980s, Leonore
Annenberg, wife of the TV Guide billionaire who was Ronald Reagan's great
good friend and his ambassador to the Court of St. James, got in Dutch
when she contravened United States' everyman protocol and twice curtsied
to Queen Elizabeth II's son and heir, Charles, the Prince of Wales--once
when she was herself this country's chief of protocol.</TE>

endorsing Riordan. It shouldn't be a litmus test for or against anyone
else."</TE>
<TE>   --State Sen. Dick Ackerman, an Irvine Republican who says he got booed
when he said nice things about Riordan, his choice for governor. It also
cost him, he is convinced, the endorsement of the very right-thinking
California Republican Assembly. Ackerman's also been lambasted for
endorsing a county supervisor who endorses the idea of an airport at the
old El Toro Marine base, even though Ackerman himself is agin' it. Those
litmus tests are killers, even when they're only pass-fail.</TE>

<HD>Payoffs Alleged in Fight Over Proposed Billboards</HD>
<DH>West Hollywood: Foes say council should rescind OK because papers
show developer bought support of residents. He says the pacts are merely
'mutual benefits' agreements.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BOB POOL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A dispute over plans for huge billboards in West Hollywood has
turned into a debate over whether a developer has paid off neighbors to
support his $250-million Sunset Strip project.</LD>
<LD>   City Council members will be asked tonight to rescind approval of a
proposal by builder Mark Siffin to erect large V-shaped billboards atop
high-rise buildings in his Sunset Boulevard development or to place a
billboard-rejection referendum on the next citywide ballot.</LD>
<LD>   The billboards could generate millions of dollars in advertising
revenue that Siffin says he needs to help make his partly constructed
Sunset Millennium project financially viable. In September, the City
Council voted 3 to 2 to approve the signs after a parade of neighboring
residents testified in favor of them.</LD>
<TE>   But opponents of the project have obtained copies of signed agreements
between Siffin and neighbors in which he promised them thousands of
dollars in exchange for their active public support of his controversial
hotel-office-retail project.</TE>
<TE>   Part of the support apparently includes a petitioning effort to get a
rival initiative on the ballot so voters can support Siffin's billboards.</TE>
<TE>   The dispute might seem confusing to outsiders who already have come to
view the Sunset Strip as Los Angeles' premier canvas for garish billboard
displays and advertising supergraphics.</TE>
<TE>   But some West Hollywood residents say the city's strict billboard
controls protect it from the blight of oversized outdoor advertising.
Until the September council vote, such billboards had been banned in the
area of Siffin's project.</TE>
<TE>   Opponents of the Sunset Millennium project say the discovery of the
agreements clouds the validity of purported public support of not only
the billboards but of the entire development, which includes blocking off
part of one street and spanning busy La Cienega Boulevard with West
Hollywood's first commercial pedestrian bridge.</TE>
<TE>   "This casts a whole other view of all of these public meetings where
people stood up and said they love the project," said G.G. Verone, a
leader of an opposition group. "I think it looks pretty horrible."</TE>
<TE>   Project opponents said a resident of an Alta Loma Road condominium
secretly gave them a copy of Siffin's agreement, which promised $200,000
to the Empire West Homeowners Assn. in exchange for residents' support of
the project.</TE>
<TE>   Homeowners also had to pledge to "conduct information and outreach
meetings" and agree not to criticize Sunset Millennium to the city "or in
the news media," according to the document.</TE>
<TE>   On Friday, Siffin acknowledged the agreements but disputed that they
were intended to buy off opposition to the project. He characterized them
as "mutual support and benefits agreements" that are similar to payments
made to cities for the impacts caused by developments. Sunset
Millennium's support in the neighborhood is genuine, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Siffin said he was able to convert dubious neighbors into supporters
by involving them in the project's design.</TE>
<TE>   "We talked, we met, and they helped shape the project support," he
said. "The notion of anybody being bought off is a completely
off-the-wall concept. They see this as their project, something they
helped shape and build."</TE>
<TE>   Empire West association President Norby Walters not only testified in
favor of the billboard plan at the City Council's Sept. 4 meeting but is
also helping circulate initiative petitions designed to preserve Siffin's
authority to erect the signs at Sunset Millennium. Walters could not be
reached for comment.</TE>
<TE>   Walters is a well-known entertainment and sports agent who attracted
national attention in a scandal in the late 1980s that tainted the
amateur sports world and led to new laws restricting athletic recruiting.</TE>
<TE>   With partner Lloyd Bloom, Walters was accused of signing dozens of
college football players to representation agreements in violation of
National Collegiate Athletic Assn. regulations. A federal investigation
led to the pair's convictions on charges of racketeering, conspiracy and
mail fraud in 1989, although the convictions were later overturned on
appeal. In 1993, Bloom was found shot to death in his Malibu home.</TE>
<TE>   Siffin has been controversial too. A Nevada Supreme Court opinion in
2000 described him as once suspected by law enforcement officials of
being a "major cocaine trafficker" who might have been connected to a
1978 Reno murder. As a result of that court ruling, the man previously
convicted in that murder was released from death row and now awaits a new
trial this spring in which Siffin may be called as a witness.</TE>
<TE>   As he has insisted in the past, Siffin said Friday that he was not
involved in the murder or drug dealing and was not involved with anybody
connected to the case.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, some West Hollywood officials said they are having second
thoughts about Sunset Millennium, especially since Siffin has signaled
that he may build an apartment complex instead of a tax-generating luxury
hotel at the site.</TE>
<TE>   "I have a lot of doubts now about what the true intention behind this
project has been from Day One," said Councilman John Duran.</TE>
<TE>   Mayor John Heilman said council members have obtained copies of
Siffin's agreements with neighbors. "I think even my colleagues who have
supported this project are feeling like they have not been dealt with
honestly," he said.</TE>

<HD>Crash Pilot a 'Hero' for Saving Lives</HD>
<DH>Accident: Victim is said to have avoided people and homes before
his plane exploded. Some living near Fullerton Airport favor flight ban.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A plane crash near Fullerton Municipal Airport on Saturday has
rekindled an old debate among neighbors about how safe they are. But all
sides are in unison about the pilot who crashed: He died trying to save
lives.</LD>
<LD>   Don Dirian, a 69-year-old Whittier pilot and engineer, was at the
controls of his beloved Cessna Skymaster, family and friends said, when
it slammed back to the ground Saturday afternoon, shortly after takeoff
from the airport. Witnesses said that thanks to the pilot's maneuvering,
the out-of-control, twin-engine plane narrowly missed houses and yards in
nearby Buena Park. Instead, it exploded in a vacant lot, half a mile
short of the runway.</LD>
<LD>   "He definitely saw us and he moved," said Clint Ochodnicky, 23, who
credits the pilot with sparing his life and that of his 10-month-old son.</LD>
<TE>   Ochodnicky said he and his son were outside when they saw a plane
coming at them. On Sunday, Ochodnicky returned to the graffiti-scarred
lot to pay his respects.</TE>
<TE>   "Oh, this guy is a hero," Ochodnicky said, looking at neighborhood
children picking up burned bits of plane.</TE>
<TE>   The Federal Aviation Administration and National Transportation Safety
Board said on Sunday the accident remains under investigation. They
declined to release further details.</TE>
<TE>   The crash, which is the 29th either near or at Fullerton Municipal
Airport since 1985, has angered some residents who said they live in fear
of a plummeting craft killing them in their homes.</TE>
<TE>   Some residents favor a petition asking that flights over their
neighborhood be stopped.</TE>
<TE>   'I love this neighborhood, but I'm very scared," said Thelma
Hernandez, who said she moved north of the flight path because she feared
that a plane would hit her home.</TE>
<TE>   The airport, she said "is too close to the houses. And there's too
many planes." As she stood in the lot, the dark shape of a plane cut
through the sun every few seconds, and she had to speak up to be heard
over the drone of engines.</TE>
<TE>   Others who came to pay their respects disagreed. Some pointed out that
the airport, where planes have been flying since 1913, was there long
before most of the housing developments.</TE>
<TE>   Said Lynne Mander, an Anaheim resident and pilot: "If you're going to
buy a house, you['d] better think about what you're doing."</TE>
<TE>   Because the pilot was badly burned, coroner officials have not
released his name. But family members and friends said it was Dirian's
plane and that he did not return; they believe he was the victim. The
family called close friends to inform them. Family members on Sunday
gathered at the Whittier house Dirian had shared for the last decade with
his wife. The family declined further comment. However, neighbors and
friends described a quiet, thoughtful man with a dry sense of humor.</TE>
<TE>   "By his actions yesterday, he saved the lives of a lot of people,"
said Barry Bailey, who said he has lived near the Dirians for 10 years.
"I think this would be typical of Don Dirian. He's just a very, very nice
human being who would rather do something positive for somebody rather
than it be the other way around."</TE>
<TE>   Neighbor Lorraine Sawyer, who heard about the crash when Dirian's wife
called Sunday morning, described him as a "very busy man," deeply
involved with his family and community. She said he was constantly on the
go, working hard at his aeronautical consulting business and visiting
places like Japan, France and England. She said the Dirians also enjoyed
traveling for pleasure and recently visited Hawaii.</TE>
<TE>   At Fullerton Airport, those who knew Dirian said he was an
accomplished and experienced pilot.</TE>
<TE>   "He was relaxed, humorous, intelligent. . . . If he was in the
military, he'd be getting a Medal of Honor for what he did yesterday,"
said colleague George Crowe.</TE>

<HD>Orange Guardsmen Tapped for Mission</HD>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>More than 100 National Guard troops based in Orange will be
deployed this week for duty in Southwest Asia, which includes the Persian
Gulf nations, officials said.</LD>
<LD>   The unit--Company B, 1st Battalion, 160th Regiment--will depart this
week to Camp Roberts north of Paso Robles, where they will undergo
additional training before being sent to their assignment, Staff Sgt.
Thomas Murotake said.</LD>
<LD>   The call-up is not a result of the homeland defense or airport
security missions, but part of ongoing peacekeeping efforts around the
world, he added.</LD>
<TE>   "This is actually something that we have been doing for several years
now," Murotake said. "Every six months or so, a National Guard unit
somewhere in the country is tapped for a National Guard mission. And this
time, it's our turn."</TE>
<TE>   The troops based in Orange, roughly 150 of them, have known about the
mission for at least six months and some for as long as a year. They are
expected to be mobilized for duty for about six months.</TE>
<TE>   Another company, based in Fullerton, was deployed to Kuwait in
September to support Operation Desert Spring, which provides security for
Patriot missile batteries that protect Kuwait from the threat of missiles
from nearby Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   Murotake declined to release any specific details about Company B's
mission because of security issues.</TE>
<TE>   "They could be protecting facilities, supply facilities or armament,"
Murotake said.</TE>

<HD>Boaters' Bay Access Hours Are Restored</HD>
<DH>Safety: For now, the Navy lifts the restriction it imposed to
protect its nearby weapons station. Pinched businesses are also relieved.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STANLEY ALLISON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The restriction on pleasure boat travel through Anaheim Bay,
imposed after the Sept. 11 attacks, has been lifted, to the cheers of
Huntington Harbour boaters.</LD>
<LD>   The Navy was limiting access to four hours a day, giving boaters a
small window of time to get their boats to and from the ocean. The
restriction was imposed because Anaheim Bay is near Navy ships that
deliver and retrieve ordnance at the Seal Beach Naval Weapons Station.</LD>
<LD>   Greg Smith, a spokesman for the weapons station, said boaters should
not get too comfortable just yet. "Yes, the harbor is back to normal, but
that is subject to change at a moment's notice," he said.</LD>
<TE>   Boaters can call a hotline--(562) 626-6000--for updates about the
bay's security status.</TE>
<TE>   Security measures are still heightened at the bay, but Smith would not
discuss them in detail. He also declined to discuss what prompted the
Navy to lift the Anaheim Bay restriction.</TE>
<TE>   The restriction not only inconvenienced boaters but also hurt harbor
businesses. Scott Lindenblatt, owner of Mariner's Point, the only gas
station in the harbor, said his business dropped about 50%. He said
marina operators and shipyards were also affected.</TE>
<TE>   He added that many of the boaters in the harbor are fishermen who
"want to be [at their fishing spots] at daybreak, which they were
precluded from doing."</TE>
<TE>   The bay had been open from 6 to 8 a.m. and 2 to 4 p.m. on weekdays,
and 6 to 9 a.m. and 2 to 4 p.m. on weekends. Those restrictions were
officially lifted Dec. 22.</TE>
<TE>   Mike Vaughn, who normally takes his 55-foot motor yacht out twice a
week--once on weekends and once during the week--had been limiting his
excursions to just the weekend.</TE>
<TE>   "It was just a headache to . . . have to time your return to the
opening of the harbor," Vaughn said.</TE>
<TE>   The restriction also affected the annual holiday Cruise of Lights,
when passengers on tour boats and personal craft from neighboring marinas
view the lights on the harbor houses.</TE>
<TE>   Except for the several tour boats, "this year it was dead," Vaughn
said.</TE>

<HD>Club Offers Support for Deaf Students</HD>
<DH>Activities: Rio Mesa High teens form state's first hearing-impaired
chapter of a popular youth leadership and mentoring program.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JENIFER RAGLAND</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The deaf teenagers sit in a circle at an Oxnard storefront office,
venting their frustrations.</LD>
<LD>   Joshua Jones, 16, complains about having to travel 50 miles from his
house in Ventura to see a movie with closed captioning.</LD>
<LD>   Angela Stegman, also 16, grouses that many of her peers at Rio Mesa
High School seem to write her off as "dumb" because she can't hear.</LD>
<TE>   Quickly, others chime in, their hands flying wildly. Through an
interpreter, some say they're upset that their parents have yet to learn
sign language. They are tired of being left out of events or even
portions of class lectures when interpreters are unavailable.</TE>
<TE>   And now, they say, they're ready to do something about it.</TE>
<TE>   With the help of Tri-County GLAD, an Oxnard-based advocacy group for
the deaf, the students have started the state's first deaf and
hard-of-hearing chapter of a well-known teen leadership program.</TE>
<TE>   Their group, called Friday Night Live, is at Rio Mesa, the site of the
county's program for deaf high school students.</TE>
<TE>   "Some of us are fed up with the way things are," Joshua said. With the
club, he said, the students can educate the community while supporting
each other.</TE>
<TE>Isolation Drives Many to Drugs, Alcohol</TE>
<TE>   At schools, churches and recreation centers across California,
teenagers in Friday Night Live organize volunteer projects, mentor
younger students and hold dances, movie nights and other events.</TE>
<TE>   Such activities are especially important in the deaf community, said
Carla Cook, an outreach coordinator for Tri-County GLAD. Isolation caused
by communication barriers drives an inordinate number of deaf people to
drugs and alcohol, Cook said.</TE>
<TE>   One report by the California Attorney General's Commission on
Disabilities found that deaf adults are twice as likely to be substance
abusers, she said.</TE>
<TE>   The club will help young people who feel exiled from the hearing
world, said Rio Mesa teacher Sandra Jahn.</TE>
<TE>   "They are getting confidence and a willingness to work with other
people," said Jahn, who is also deaf. "They want others to know that they
can go out and do something."</TE>
<TE>   Recently, the youth group performed "A Christmas Carol" in sign
language for deaf children and their parents at a holiday festival in
Oxnard.</TE>
<TE>   Future projects may include pushing for closed-caption technology in
Ventura County movie theaters--none offer the service now--and doing drug
education for deaf elementary and middle school students, Cook said.</TE>
<TE>   The students also said they want to encourage more parents of deaf
children to learn signing.</TE>
<TE>   Of the nine teenagers in the Rio Mesa club, only three have at least
one parent fluent in sign language. Nationwide, just 10% of hearing
parents with deaf children learn sign language, Cook said.</TE>
<TE>   "I want to be closer with my parents," said 17-year-old Olga Uribe,
"but I can't communicate with them."</TE>
<TE>   Although the Rio Mesa chapter was started by the deaf teens, it will
not exclude hearing students, Jahn said.</TE>
<TE>   Rio Mesa once had a Friday Night Live club for everyone, but the
events never included interpreters.</TE>
<TE>   "Now we're doing it so that we make sure it's accessible to the deaf
students first," Cook said.</TE>
<TE>Programs Beginning at Other Schools</TE>
<TE>   Friday Night Live clubs are run by students but coordinated by Annette
Preciado, who works out of the Ventura County superintendent of schools
office.</TE>
<TE>   Programs also are starting for deaf students at Cabrillo Middle School
and Loma Vista Elementary in Ventura.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it's great," Preciado said. "It's an opportunity, not only
for the deaf youth to learn and grow, but also for the other youth
involved. Once we start doing countywide activities, it will be a
learning experience for both."</TE>

<HD>Chatsworth Cowboy Relies on Horse Sense to Fend Off Local
Developers</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PATRICIA WARD BIEDERMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Chatsworth's Jerry England hasn't heard that the Old West is dead.
When the blue-jeaned, cowboy-booted activist sees something that
threatens equestrian culture, he jumps on his trusty palomino, Sunup, and
rides out to do battle.</LD>
<LD>   England's world view is as clear as the sky over the Santa Susana
Mountains after a hard rain. He believes the bad guys are land developers
and others who don't know a halter from a hatrack and think the world
needs more tennis courts and fewer horses trotting through the vanishing
wilderness.</LD>
<LD>   "We're really out to preserve a culture that has lasted for 100 years
and is definitely threatened," said the 59-year-old England, his face
lined from thousands of rides in the Southern California sun. Like
hundreds of others in Chatsworth, Old Agoura and a few other communities,
England rides every day the howling winds permit.</LD>
<TE>   His three horses are stabled beyond the pool of the Chatsworth ranch
house he shares with his wife, Joyce, a retired teacher.</TE>
<TE>   According to the Washington, D.C.-based American Horse Council,
California has more horses than any other state--642,000.</TE>
<TE>   Horse people and suburbanites tend to see the world differently,
England said. Horse folks have rural values and expectations, which
include tolerance for flies, dust and smells that sometimes accompany
horses, he said. Most suburban dwellers, he said, would rather live
without the perfume of equestrian life and don't like sharing the road
with big, skittish animals that might buck or bolt when an SUV roars by.</TE>
<TE>   To give the local equestrian community some clout, England founded
Chatsworth Equine Cultural Heritage Organization, or ECHO, in 2000. He
estimates there are 700 horses in Chatsworth, many of them boarded by
people who live elsewhere.</TE>
<TE>   "There's a hard-core active group of about 300 who are fighting with
their money, their time and their mouths," he said.</TE>
<TE>   England organized a mounted protest in July against a 21-lot
subdivision planned for 6.7 acres in the heart of Chatsworth horse
country. Proposed by Airport Commission President Ted Stein, the project
was approved by the Los Angeles City Council in October but faces a
lawsuit brought by the Chatsworth Land Preservation Assn.</TE>
<TE>   In July, 162 protesters rode horses down Topanga Canyon Boulevard,
accompanied by 140 supporters on foot.</TE>
<TE>   England is also worried about a 484-house project planned by a group
called Presidio Chatsworth Partners in the unincorporated area north of
the Ronald Reagan Freeway. The project, which has no provision for
horses, would have "a huge impact on the horse community," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "Every time you take away the horse-keeping rights on a piece of land,
you're never going to get them back," England said.</TE>
<TE>   Even before the houses go up, England believes the project would
create problems for riders: "It's going to bring in heavy equipment and
trucks that horses are afraid of," he said.</TE>
<TE>   England has confronted local politicians, including Councilman Hal
Bernson, asking why the city doesn't abide by the Chatsworth/Porter Ranch
master plan, which requires the area to remain horse country. He has
fought for improved horse trails and a better warning system at a spot
where horses cross Metrolink tracks. He has publicly decried dumping in
nearby Deer Lake Highlands Park and other wilderness areas.</TE>
<TE>   Actor Errol Flynn once had a hunting lodge in Deer Lake Canyon,
England pointed out. Now, he said, "People drive up into the canyons and
dump refrigerators, desks, sofas, old cars, lots of broken glass and
drums leaking some sort of liquid."</TE>
<TE>   England is also troubled by the homeless who build campfires in the
area. "I'm worried about a real Oakland, a conflagration," said England,
referring to the costly 1991 Oakland hills blaze.</TE>
<TE>   England first got on a horse when he was 7. Buck Jones and Tim McCoy,
cowboy stars of the 1940s and '50s, were childhood idols, as was the
triumvirate of great TV cowboys--Hopalong Cassidy, Gene Autry and Roy
Rogers.</TE>
<TE>   In 1991, England was working for Glen-Fed Development, a home-building
subsidiary of Glendale Federal Bank, when he was laid off. In his spare
time, he was making wood furniture with Western motifs.</TE>
<TE>   "When I started building this furniture and got laid off, my lifestyle
changed," said England, whose conversion to all things Western includes
writing cowboy poetry.</TE>
<TE>   Nationwide, equestrian activists such as England are fighting for
horse trails, pro-horse zoning and other equine-friendly legislation,
according to Kandee Haertel, executive director of Equestrian Land
Conservation Resource, based in Galena, Ill. She could not estimate their
numbers, but she gets hundreds of queries each month from concerned
riders.</TE>
<TE>   Because keeping horses is so time-consuming, Haertel said, many riders
don't bother to take political action. "The horse activist community is
very fragmented," she said.</TE>
<TE>   England hopes to ride for at least 15 more years, although he needs to
stand on something to mount a horse these days. "You hope people don't
look," he said.</TE>
<TE>   England views horses as an integral part of the world he sees on his
morning rides. "It's a pristine area. It's got coyotes, bobcats, the
occasional mountain lion, deer and every kind of raptor you can think
of."</TE>
<TE>   The Internet has made it easy to communicate with the riders and to
send out mass mailings, England said. But if his technology is new, the
code he lives by is older than reruns of "The Lone Ranger."</TE>
<TE>   "Hoppy, Gene and Roy showed us the way to fight, good versus evil,"
said England, who says he can all but see the black hats on his opponents
when he faces them down. "I know there's going to be change, but it can
be friendly change."</TE>

<LD>Two brothers have been arrested on suspicion of robbing a gas
station in Santa Paula of an undisclosed amount of cash, police said
Sunday.</LD>
<LD>   William Macias, 31, and Lucas Macias, 32, both of Santa Paula, were

<LD>   Two men entered the station's store about 10:30 p.m. and waited for
customers to leave before ordering the clerk to empty the cash register.
Police said one of the men pulled a knife. The robbers fled on foot. The
suspects were arrested several minutes later about a block away.</LD>
<TE>   Both men were booked into Ventura County Jail on suspicion of armed
robbery. William Macias also was being held on suspicion of making
terrorist threats and possessing burglary tools.</TE>

<HD>Gallegly Faces Dilemma Over Finance Reform</HD>
<DH>Politics: Simi Valley congressman is pressured to revive bill he
co-sponsored, but that could alienate Republican leaders.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARGARET TALEV</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>U.S. Rep. Elton Gallegly (R-Simi Valley) is coming under pressure
to break with his party's leadership by bringing a major campaign finance
reform package out of mothballs for a vote.</LD>
<LD>   The Shays-Meehan bill would curtail soft-money
contributions--unlimited donations from labor unions and corporations
that are sent to political parties to benefit candidates.</LD>
<LD>   Backers of the reform measure say soft money is increasingly a
corrupting force in American politics, allowing special interest groups
to skirt contribution limits and exert undue influence.</LD>
<TE>   A study by public interest group Common Cause found that $63 million
in soft money flowed to Democrats and Republicans in the 1992 election
cycle; by 2000, soft-money contributions jumped to about $600 million.</TE>
<TE>   Gallegly had signed on as a co-sponsor of the legislation by Reps.
Christopher Shays (R-Conn.) and Martin T. Meehan (D-Mass.), but House
leaders last year blocked the legislation from going to a full vote.</TE>
<TE>   Advocates can force a vote, but only by getting a majority of the
House to sign a petition calling for such an action. To date, supporters
have 214 of 218 needed signatures. Gallegly's is not among them.</TE>
<TE>   Gallegly did not return phone calls for comment.</TE>
<TE>   If proponents pressure him to sign the so-called "discharge petition,"
reform advocates say, Gallegly could face a backlash from party leaders,
threatening his committee memberships or pet legislation, including
Ventura County projects.</TE>
<TE>   If he doesn't sign, they say, they will paint him as a hypocrite in
this year's reelection campaign.</TE>
<TE>   "The acid test here, if you call yourself a supporter of reform, is
you've got to sign the discharge petition," said Matt Keller, legislative
director for Common Cause. "It is the only way to bring this bill to the
House of Representatives."</TE>
<TE>   An eight-term incumbent, Gallegly doesn't need soft money to pad his
own campaign war chest. He raised just more than $1 million in his last
campaign, with less than $6,000 coming from Republican Party funds.</TE>
<TE>   But some of Gallegly's large corporate contributors have also been
significant soft-money contributors on the national stage. These include
Bank of America; SBC Communications; committees representing Realtors,
home builders and automobile dealers; and Thousand Oaks-based Amgen Inc.</TE>
<TE>   Gary Jacobson, a professor of political science at UC San Diego, said
it is probably not in Gallegly's best political interest to sign the
petition.</TE>
<TE>Not Much Public Interest in Reform</TE>
<TE>   "There's really little evidence that voters get excited one way or
another about whether individual members support campaign finance
reform," Jacobson said.</TE>
<TE>   Additionally, Jacobson doesn't believe that curtailing soft money will
stop massive special-interest spending in the long run; corporations will
find another way to route the money.</TE>
<TE>   And although Democrats might try to attack Gallegly for failing to
sign the petition, Jacobson said that could backfire if the Democratic
Party pours soft money into the campaign of Gallegly's opponent in the
general election.</TE>
<TE>   That opponent, Thousand Oaks public relations consultant Fern Rudin,
acknowledged that she probably would take soft money if the Democratic
Party offered it.</TE>
<TE>   "Am I going to take that kind of money from major corporations? No,"
she said. "Am I going to take money that could be a conflict of interest
to what I'm going to do in Washington? No.</TE>
<TE>   "But I don't see money coming from the Democratic Party as being the
same thing. They're the people who asked me to run, and I have a
responsibility."</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, Rudin said Gallegly's reluctance to force a vote on
a measure he co-sponsored should be a campaign issue.</TE>
<TE>   "If he thinks he co-sponsored the legislation in error, let him say
so," she said. "But for him to not say anything is not living up to one's
responsibility."</TE>
<TE>Bill's Co-Author Backs Gallegly</TE>
<TE>   One person who is not putting pressure on Gallegly to sign the
petition is fellow Republican Shays.</TE>
<TE>   He said Gallegly had always qualified his support of the legislation,
saying he favored some reform but not every aspect of Shays' plan.</TE>
<TE>   "Elton has been a wonderful supporter of campaign finance reform, but
he doesn't pretend to be totally 100% for it," Shays said. "If my choice
is to have him sign the petition or vote for the bill and against any bad
amendments, my choice would be the latter.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't want someone who has signed the petition to then go to
leadership and say, 'I know you're unhappy that I signed the petition,
but now I'll make you happy by supporting bad amendments,' " Shays said.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't want to win the battle and lose the war."</TE>

<HD>Scholar-in-Residence Program Opens With Israeli Author's Visit</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>WILLIAM LOBDELL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A 34-year-old Jewish businessman has launched a program--only the
fourth of its kind in the nation--to bring a top Israeli scholar to
Orange County each year for a monthlong series of lectures at synagogues
and universities and to community groups.</LD>
<LD>   The scholar-in-residence program, the brainchild of Arie Katz, general
counsel to a Newport Beach fitness firm, will kick off later this month
with Hebrew University of Jerusalem's Avigdor Shinan as its inaugural
lecturer.</LD>
<LD>   Shinan, author of six books and chairman of the Hebrew literature
department and the university's dean of students, is to give 28 talks in
26 days to a spectrum of Jewish audiences, from Orthodox to Reform to
nonobservant and secular crowds.</LD>
<TE>   He's already proved his popularity elsewhere.</TE>
<TE>   "Are they going to have Dr. Shinan? Oh, go! He's outstanding!" said
Clara S. Gordon, whose Foundation for Jewish Studies in Rockville, Md.,
is credited with starting the Jewish scholar-in-residence program 15
years ago in Washington, D.C. "He had groupies when he was with us.
People followed him around from lecture to lecture."</TE>
<TE>   The idea, Katz said, is to give the Jewish community longer exposure
to world-class scholars by pooling financial resources to pay the bill;
similar programs can cost up to $60,000 a month to run.</TE>
<TE>   "No single synagogue could possibly afford to bring a serious scholar
in from Israel for a month. No one is that rich," said Rabbi Martin Cohen
of Congregation Eilat in Mission Viejo. "By sharing, everything becomes
reasonable."</TE>
<TE>   Topics of Shinan's Orange County lectures will include: "The Encounter
With Islam in Rabbinic Literature," "The Creation of Eve in the Talmud"
and "Moses and his Two Wives."</TE>
<TE>   While in Orange County, Shinan will live in a donated beachfront home
in Newport Beach, be given a car, food, a personal kosher chef and an
undisclosed honorarium. The program is scheduled mostly for February, to
coincide with the semester break at Israeli universities, allowing easier
access to professors.</TE>
<TE>   Katz said he expected expenses to run about $30,000 the first year.
The tab is being paid by a rare alliance of Jewish organizations,
synagogues and community members that will allow the lectures to be free
or low cost to the public.</TE>
<TE>   "It's very unusual, all the cooperation," Katz said.</TE>
<TE>   The intense desire to hear top academics erases congregational and
political barriers, said program organizers.</TE>
<TE>   "That is one of the pluses," Gordon said. "It brings the community
together for the purpose of study."</TE>
<TE>   Still, complex logistics, lack of cooperation among groups and limited
funding have kept the scholar-in-residence program to a few Jewish
communities.</TE>
<TE>   Katz said he came up with the idea last year after a weekend retreat
that featured a renowned Jewish scholar. He left wanting more, especially
since he lived in Orange County, where access to top Jewish scholarship
was limited. The recent Boston transplant said he had been spoiled by the
opportunities available at Harvard University and other area colleges.</TE>
<TE>   "I figured I could either leave Orange County and go somewhere else or
create something here," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Research led him to the scholar-in-residence programs in Washington
D.C., Houston and West Palm Beach, Fla.</TE>
<TE>   "It's really a treat to the community," said Marilyn Hassid, program
director of the Jewish Community Center of Houston, which has sponsored
the program for 14 years.</TE>
<TE>   The program differs from traditional one-night or weekend lectures
because people can delve more deeply into subjects by attending more
talks.</TE>
<TE>   Rabbi Cohen said people have the opportunity to attend a year's worth
of university lectures in a month.</TE>
<TE>   "It's unbelievable," he said. "People take years off of work and spend
hundreds of thousands of dollars to get this kind of education."</TE>

<HD>Curtain Rises on Bid to Save Theater</HD>
<DH>Fullerton: Renovating the dilapidated Fox building could cost
millions, but supporters of downtown redevelopment call it 'the last
piece of the puzzle.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JERRY HICKS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Ernie Chapman, though just a lad in 1925, vividly recalls the grand
opening of the Fox Theatre in downtown Fullerton that year. Instead of a
silent movie, his brother, Stanley, who built it, had managed to book
members of Broadway's Ziegfeld Follies.</LD>
<LD>   "How splendid it was," recalled Chapman, now 90.</LD>
<LD>   In those days, the place was called Alicia Court, named after Stanley
Chapman's wife, Alice Ellen. Soon after, it became Mission Court.</LD>
<TE>   But a few years later, in 1930, the Fox theater chain took it over.
The theater--on Harbor Boulevard just north of Chapman Avenue--reigned
for decades as the city's downtown architectural showpiece.</TE>
<TE>   Now, it is Fullerton's embarrassing eyesore. Closed since 1987, the
place is a condemned, two-story hulk of plaster and brick.</TE>
<TE>   The window where ticket takers used to sit in resplendent tuxedos is
coated with grime. A cardboard-covered security gate blocks the front
courtyard where moviegoers once sipped tea. The stone Greek-inspired
theatrical mask high on the building's front, its eyes once bulging with
colored lights, can only be seen now from across the street.</TE>
<TE>   Despite considerable municipal and private efforts to revive the Fox,
nothing promising is in the works. The message on the marquee describes
the building's bleak and needy existence: Available.</TE>
<TE>   Though much of downtown Fullerton has seen a resurgence, thanks to
millions of dollars in redevelopment funds, the Fox continues to
deteriorate. City officials know it's just getting worse and are renewing
their efforts to save the building.</TE>
<TE>   "In Fullerton, 2002 has got to be the Year of the Fox," said
Councilwoman Jan Flory. "We just can't go on like this."</TE>
<TE>City's Ambitious Plans Go Nowhere</TE>
<TE>   Efforts to save the theater have been made before.</TE>
<TE>   In the late 1990s, a private city support group, Fullerton Heritage,
gathered about 10,000 signatures urging that the Fox be saved. Two years
ago, that almost happened.</TE>
<TE>   The city had an option from the owner, Beverly Hills
attorney-businessman Edward Lewis, to take it over. The city began
working with a partnership headed by developer Doug Chaffee and local
restaurateur Paul Berkman. They had ambitious plans, including serving
food with wine or beer in the theater's balcony. The city agreed to spend
$3 million on a new parking structure.</TE>
<TE>   In the end, the numbers just wouldn't crunch. The city's option ran
out, and the deal was scrapped.</TE>
<TE>   "It's just not conceivable," Berkman said. "It would take $4 [million]
to $5 million to buy something that doesn't have one thing inside worth
keeping."</TE>
<TE>   Gary Chalupsky, the city's redevelopment director, agreed. "Every
system inside the place needs an overhaul," he said.</TE>
<TE>   So Lewis was back where he started. He has since moved to Paris, and
doesn't even return the city's telephone calls. (Nor did his Beverly
Hills office return calls from The Times.)</TE>
<TE>   The city's Redevelopment Agency has a slick brochure it is sending out
to potential developers "inviting proposals."</TE>
<TE>   "The Fox Theatre complex is strategically located at one of
Fullerton's busiest intersections," the marketing pamphlet states.</TE>
<TE>   But some of the same obstacles exist that led to the Fox's closure
nearly 15 years ago. Who is going to open a single-screen theater with
limited downtown parking when there already are so many new multiplex
theaters in the area?</TE>
<TE>   Even Cal State Fullerton is building new cinemas. The city also has
helped upgrade Plummer Auditorium at Fullerton College, so that
undermines the argument that the Fox is needed for stage productions.</TE>
<TE>   Despite those problems, the Fullerton Downtown Business Assn. wants to
see something done soon. And it would prefer that the Fox be reborn as a
movie house.</TE>
<TE>   "A theater makes a downtown," said association President Martin Ritto.
"It draws people in. They bring their business with them."</TE>
<TE>   Ten years ago, city officials say, the dilapidated theater wouldn't
have stood out so much. Most of the rest of downtown had a musky,
condemned look too. But about 90 downtown businesses took advantage of
redevelopment loans to upgrade their buildings, many of which were
restored to their original look. In 1998, Fullerton won the California
League of Cities' highest award for downtown revival.</TE>
<TE>   Chad Lowe, executive director of the Fullerton Chamber of Commerce,
calls the Fox dilemma "the last piece of the puzzle."</TE>
<TE>   Berkman, the restaurateur, said he's no longer interested. But city
officials hope that developer Chaffee may still be able to put something
together. Chaffee could not be reached for comment.</TE>
<TE>   Flory insists that if the city makes the Fox a priority, something
positive can happen in 2002. "My husband and I loved the Fox," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Experts are certain the building can be restored, even the murals,
which were painted over long ago after deteriorating from age and water
leakage from the roof. The question is, does Fullerton really need
another theater, and at what cost?</TE>
<TE>   Fullerton Heritage is certain of the answer. In a recent letter to
area residents, the support group wrote: "We don't need just another
movie theater. We do need to be responsible caretakers for our city's
past."</TE>

<HD>CDC Study on Suburban Life Hits a Nerve</HD>
<DH>Environment: Researchers found that health suffers because of urban
sprawl and dependency on cars. Home builders dismiss the study, funded by
slow-growth advocates.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>EVAN HALPER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Warning: Suburban living may be killing you.</LD>
<LD>   So say top environmental health experts at the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention. Suburbanites don't burn the calories others do
walking or biking places, the theory goes, because poor urban design
forces them to sit in their cars to go anywhere.</LD>
<LD>   There's far from universal agreement on the study. Other analysts at
the CDC have reported that there is no better place to live than the
suburbs if you want to be healthy.</LD>
<TE>   But the study's conclusions have certainly struck a nerve.</TE>
<TE>   "Calling this 'junk science' is too complimentary," said Laer Pearce,
a Laguna Hills-based spokesman for the Southern California Building
Industry Assn. "It is just junk."</TE>
<TE>   Home builders are angrily denouncing the report, released in the fall.
They note that it came on the heels of an earlier CDC study that
concluded that those who dwell in their master-planned neighborhoods are
pillars of good health.</TE>
<TE>   Scientists are just beginning to turn their attention to urban sprawl
as a public health issue. But they are already advising that they will
have plenty more to say as they look closer at the health effects of what
they consider poor urban planning.</TE>
<TE>   Richard Jackson, the CDC's top environmental health expert, wrote the
controversial report with colleague Chris Kochtitzky. The research was
funded by Sprawlwatch, a Washington, D.C.-based slow-growth advocacy
group.</TE>
<TE>   It's that alliance that has provoked much of the ire of home builders.</TE>
<TE>   Jackson makes no apologies. Sprawlwatch offered to fund what he
considered a long-overdue paper. He and Kochtitzky are writing a book on
the public health consequences of unmanaged growth, which he says
Americans too often "ignore at our peril."</TE>
<TE>   Consider, he says, a study showing that the average person living in
Washington, D.C., walks 10,000 steps a day.</TE>
<TE>   "You cannot do that living in a place like Orange County," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The report is filled with similar examples. One study cited suggests
that students are four times more likely to be able to walk to schools
constructed before 1983. The authors say newer schools are built on the
fringes of developments and often designed in ways that make them
inaccessible to walkers and cyclists. Another study shows that children
walked or biked for nearly 16% of all the trips they made in 1977. Twenty
years later, that figure was down to 10%.</TE>
<TE>   "This is not yet a smoking gun," Jackson said. "It is a policy piece.
We're putting forward hypotheses and thinking about how these things
contribute to the public health. Our goal is to make home builders
realize they can have a tremendous impact."</TE>
<TE>Sprawl-Induced Air Pollution</TE>
<TE>   Environmentalists have warned for years about the unintended health
effects of low-density, auto-dependent communities. The American Lung
Assn. has issued some reports about the dangers of sprawl-induced air
pollution. But the move to link sprawl to deteriorating health turned a
corner in November when slow-growth advocates announced that CDC experts
were on board.</TE>
<TE>   The findings are ironic. Americans initially flocked to the suburbs to
get outdoors, breathe fresh air and leave the pollution and lack of green
space in the big cities behind. Now experts warn that the suburbs have
become so auto-oriented that walking to the store is often
near-impossible and that open space preservation is not keeping pace with
growth.</TE>
<TE>   "People assume the suburban lifestyle is inherently more healthy,
largely because of access to nature," said William Fulton, a land-use
expert and author of books about urban growth in California. "But the
suburbs aren't like that anymore. People have small yards, and they are
surrounded by traffic.</TE>
<TE>   "There is a big difference between living in a bucolic suburb of the
1950s and living in Orange County today," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The impact of urban design on public health began to intrigue Jackson
during his 20 years as a state epidemiologist and environmental health
director in California.</TE>
<TE>   "Talk to people on the street in Orange County about the environment,
and they will tell you there is nowhere nearby for their children to
play, there is not enough green space in walking distance, they can't get
anywhere without getting in a car and, if they want to go downtown, they
have to sit in traffic for an hour and a half," Jackson said.</TE>
<TE>   Yes, people are getting out of shape because they just don't exercise,
the authors acknowledge. But they say the two main reasons people give
for not exercising are lack of accessible places to do so and concerns
about safety in the places that do exist.</TE>
<TE>   One section of the report discusses the increasing number of
pedestrians and bicyclists being hit by cars. Most of these accidents
occur in sprawling new developments with inadequate sidewalks and
crosswalks, according to the statistics cited.</TE>
<TE>   The authors also contend that "many different types of urban design
encourage sedentary living habits."</TE>
<TE>   They propose high-density developments with a mix of homes, stores and
office space that allow for fully integrated, racially and economically
diverse, walkable communities. Claustrophobic lawns get traded in for
community parks and trails in proximity to everyone.</TE>
<TE>   "While older cities and towns were planned and built based on the
practical idea that stores and services should be within walking
distances of residences, the design of most new residential areas
reflects the supposition that people will drive to most destinations,"
the report states.</TE>
<TE>Report Called a 'Ludicrous Sham'</TE>
<TE>   Home builders say such statements prove that the authors are pandering
to Sprawlwatch's agenda.</TE>
<TE>   "This report is a ludicrous sham," said Pearce of the Southern
California Building Industry Assn. "Why are CDC resources being used to
move a political agenda?"</TE>
<TE>   That view is echoed by builders nationally.</TE>
<TE>   "The authors seem less inclined to debate the fundamental issues of
growth than to try to regulate lifestyles," Bruce Smith, president of the
National Assn. of Home Builders, said in a statement.</TE>
<TE>   "We'll all be better off if they [CDC] stick to what they do
best--fighting physical diseases, not defending political ones," he said,
adding that surveys consistently show that homeowners do not want to live
in dense, mixed-use neighborhoods.</TE>
<TE>   The CDC's own findings, according to the home builders association,
undermine Jackson's report. Smith points to an official CDC study
released in September that says suburbanites are the healthiest people in
the country, exercising more and living longer than residents of rural
and urban areas.</TE>
<TE>   "Will the real CDC please step forward?" Smith said.</TE>
<TE>   Jackson said the earlier report is skewed by the many affluent people
in the suburbs with access to top health insurance, gym memberships and
homes near bike trail networks. He said opportunities to exercise without
driving somewhere are falling out of reach of most low-income families,
as well as an increasingly large portion of the middle class and elderly
as green space disappears in the suburbs.</TE>
<TE>   "We are designing environments that actually restrict people's
options," he said. "We need to be offering people options to take charge
of their health."</TE>
<TE>   While the home builders advise CDC officials to stick to matters of
toxins and treatments, many urban planning experts say now is the time
for the public health community to step into the sprawl debate.</TE>
<TE>   "These are interesting discussions to have," said Scott Bollens,
chairman of urban and regional planning at UC Irvine. "For years, people
talked about sprawl increasing travel time. This is an attempt to talk
more specifically about what it does to human physical and psychological
well-being. It is really trying to look at what urban development
patterns do to the individual."</TE>

<HD>No Golden Gate, Tower Bridge in Sacramento Still Wants to Shine</HD>
<DH>Landmark: Residents get to vote on the color scheme Caltrans will
use in painting the span built in mid-'30s.</DH>

<DL>SACRAMENTO
</DL>
<LD>In an unusual exercise in direct democracy, California's typically
stodgy transportation agency has asked residents to decide what color to
paint one of the capital's most visible public works--the sprawling Tower
Bridge spanning the Sacramento River.</LD>
<LD>   Caltrans is holding an election to let residents within a 35-mile
radius select from among three paint schemes to replace the faded ochre
hue that has adorned the 737-foot-long structure for a quarter of a
century.</LD>
<LD>   Voting started last week, with ballots cast over the Internet or via
telephone. At the start of the weekend, more than 36,000 people had
weighed in. Officials predict as many as 200,000 votes before the
balloting concludes at midnight Jan. 31.</LD>
<TE>   Like any good election, the race is neck-and-neck.</TE>
<TE>   As of Sunday evening, both the all-gold scheme and the
green-gold-silver ensemble had identical 46% tallies. The other choice,
burgundy-silver-gold, is running a poor third.</TE>
<TE>   The results will be announced with fanfare at the base of the bridge
on Feb. 4. In the meantime, folks all over town are doing a fair amount
of yammering about the quest to pick a bridge color.</TE>
<TE>   Sacramento Mayor Heather Fargo said she has been stopped on the street
and in elevators by constituents eager to offer their pick. "People are
engaged," said Fargo, who admits to preferring the all-gold scheme. "This
is Sacramento's gateway. There's an emotional attachment to this bridge."</TE>
<TE>   A local radio talk show host has suggested an alternative color
suitable for these patriotic times: red, white and blue.</TE>
<TE>Bridge, Capitol Dome Are Most Photographed</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Caltrans has been hit by a plethora of pithy e-mails. One
woman questioned why the agency didn't consider a mix of mauve and
chartreuse. Another, noting the flurry of corporate names foisted on
big-city athletic stadiums these days, suggested the painting project be
underwritten by big business. Call it the Krispy Kreme Tower Bridge, for
instance, or maybe Carmichael Honda Span.</TE>
<TE>   The bridge itself, of course, had no comment. But its reputation
speaks volumes.</TE>
<TE>   Built in the mid-1930s in the depths of the Great Depression, the
160-foot-high span is the western gateway to the capital city, stretching
across a lazy bend of the river like some twin-humped steel camel. At
night, with spotlights illuminating its double towers, the bridge is one
of the most visible structures on the horizon.</TE>
<TE>   "When the fog is in, with the symmetry of the lights on the river,
it's just magic," said Chuck Dalldorf, who resides in a riverfront
high-rise facing the span.</TE>
<TE>   The bridge also shares a distinction with the golden dome of the state
Capitol as one of the most-photographed spots in the city. And when the
hometown Kings professional basketball team make it onto national TV, the
blimp shots typically dwell on the Tower Bridge.</TE>
<TE>   Ed Astone has worked in the bridge's shadow for 37 years, since the
day he took the job of managing Sacramento's historic Old Town. These
days, sign boards announcing the vote are going up on the riverfront
tourism district. Astone admits to feeling like a man watching a dowdy
friend finally upgrading to a new suit of clothes.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a funky-looking thing," he said. "But I'm a funky-looking thing,
so I can relate to that. I was born about the same time it opened. So I
have a certain affinity with it."</TE>
<TE>   Though it lacks the majesty of the Golden Gate, the bridge still holds
a firm spot in the hearts of capital denizens. Locals and tourists
delight at what Astone calls "a little part of the river choreography,"
as the bridge's 209-foot-long center span is hoisted simultaneously up
the two towers to let paddle-wheelers and tall-masted sailboats pass
underneath.</TE>
<TE>   The idea for the public vote came right from the top.</TE>
<TE>   Caltrans director Jeff Morales was in a meeting when District 3
director Jody Lonergan mentioned the bridge-painting project. Lonergan
noted that she planned to ask leaders of Sacramento and West Sacramento,
just across the river, to help pick a color. Morales countered with the
idea of a public vote.</TE>
<TE>   "We kind of ran with it," Lonergan said.</TE>
<TE>9 Color Schemes Narrowed to Just 3</TE>
<TE>   Nine potential color schemes had been suggested by the Caltrans
"structures aesthetics unit," a tiny arm of the giant agency.</TE>
<TE>   Among the initial paint possibilities were a solid green, solid
burgundy and the bridge's original 1935 color of silver. Also on the list
were a variety of color combinations.</TE>
<TE>   Local officials helped narrow it down to the final three.</TE>
<TE>   The all-gold is a more lustrous variant on the current ochre color and
an ode to the area's Gold Rush past. The green scheme picks up the
foliage of the riverbanks and the muddy green waters. The burgundy
reflects the red of the river paddle boats and the brick of Old Town.</TE>
<TE>   Lonergan hopes the vote, a first for Caltrans, will engage the public
in a process in which it typically lacks a say.</TE>
<TE>   "People are having fun with it," she said. "They'll think of it as
their bridge when it's painted."</TE>
<TE>   Having a stake in the structure also might make the painful traffic
delays during the painting project a bit more palatable.</TE>
<TE>   At times, whole lanes will be closed as Caltrans crews strip down
rusty portions to bare metal, then put on primer and two final coats of
paint.</TE>
<TE>   Environmental concerns will complicate the process, as painters labor
inside an enclosed, plastic-tarped area to prevent the toxic, lead-based
paint from flecking off into the river.</TE>
<TE>   With such precautions, the painting job will stretch over 15 months
and cost $3.5 million. For comparison's sake, the bridge was built in
about a year at a cost of $994,000 in 1930s dollars.</TE>
<TE>   The Web site for the project is http://www.towerbridge.dot.ca.gov,
though voting is limited to people who have a Sacramento-area ZIP Code.</TE>

<HD>Manzanar Building to Be Visitor Center</HD>
<DH>History: Project is the most visible yet in a long effort to mark
the forced relocation of Japanese Americans during World War II.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BETTINA BOXALL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A decade after the Manzanar relocation camp was named a national
historic site, work is set to begin on a $5-million project to turn one
of its last remaining buildings into a visitors center.</LD>
<LD>   The renovation is the most visible undertaking yet in a long effort to
commemorate a dubious moment in U.S. history: the wartime roundup of
Japanese Americans living on the West Coast.</LD>
<LD>   More than 10,000 wound up at Manzanar, in a collection of wooden
barracks thrown up on a barren piece of the Owens Valley 200 miles
northeast of Los Angeles.</LD>
<TE>   Most of the camp was dismantled after World War II. The large
auditorium was left and used by Inyo County as a road maintenance
facility.</TE>
<TE>   The National Park Service, which oversees the site, expects to award
bids for renovation of the auditorium within the next few weeks and start
construction in the spring. A 2003 opening is planned for the building,
which will house administrative offices and the visitors center,
including exhibition space and theaters for presentations and the
screening of a short film about the camp.</TE>
<TE>   A wing that was removed will be rebuilt and another wing will be
refurbished to reflect the wooden auditorium's original appearance.</TE>
<TE>   The effort to save Manzanar from oblivion has been slow and
painstaking. The camp was designated a national historic site in 1992, 50
years after it was hastily erected under an executive order decreeing the
resettlement of West Coast residents of Japanese descent.</TE>
<TE>   About 120,000 were shipped to 10 camps in the West and Arkansas after
America's entry into World War II. Manzanar was the first site to open,
and operated from 1942 to 1945. With a peak population of 10,000 crammed
onto a square mile, it was the largest community between Los Angeles and
Reno.</TE>
<TE>   In attempting to retell Manzanar's story, the park service is treading
on sensitive ground. There has been a debate, for instance, over whether
the site should be called a relocation center or a concentration camp.</TE>
<TE>   "The [Japanese American] community is very much in favor of using the
term 'concentration camp,' " said Sue Embrey of Los Angeles, who was sent
to Manzanar as a teenager and heads a nonprofit group dedicated to
preserving it.</TE>
<TE>   "To them, barbed-wire fences and guard towers and soldiers with rifles
and searchlights at night means that--people concentrated," said Embrey,
recalling camp conditions.</TE>
<TE>   The park service instead opted for "war relocation center."</TE>
<TE>   Still, Embrey said park service personnel are doing a good job of
creating an accurate picture of life at Manzanar. "These people are
really dedicated."</TE>
<TE>   It helps that there is an unusually large photographic record of the
camp, said Manzanar Supt. Frank Hays. Some were taken by landscape
photographer Ansel Adams, who spent much of his time in the Sierra
Nevada, next door to Manzanar. Many were taken by Toyo Miyatake, an
internee who smuggled a camera into the camp and eventually photographed
life there with the consent of the Manzanar command. A home movie of the
camp was even found.</TE>
<TE>   The park service has put out a call for camp artifacts and buildings,
many of which were hauled away to other parts of the Owens Valley after
Manzanar was closed. Inyo County, Hays said, is going to donate a former
camp mess hall that was later used as a hospital.</TE>
<TE>   After the site was designated, it took years for the park service to
arrange a land swap with the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power,
which owned the camp property as part of its vast holdings in the Owens
Valley.</TE>
<TE>   Then Congress had to approve funding for the auditorium renovation. In
the last couple of years, the park service has organized a driving tour
of the site, reconstructed a barbed-wire fence around the camp core and
restored sentry posts at the entrance off U.S. 395.</TE>
<TE>   The park service hopes to eventually re-create a block of barracks as
well as one of eight guard towers that ringed the camp perimeter. More
funding will be needed to do that.</TE>
<TE>   Embrey said that those who lived at Manzanar are eager to see the
project move ahead.</TE>
<TE>   "People who are former internees get very anxious to see something
done before they die," she said.</TE>

<LD>Not all doctors who are ordered to pay damages to patients end up
paying the price on their records, according to a newspaper investigation
that found only some cases ever make it into the Medical Board of
California's records.</LD>
<LD>   One-third of 66 reviewed cases were entered into the agency's computer
database, according to the San Francisco Chronicle. However, all of the
cases' verdicts and arbitration awards were widely reported by the media
in the last three years.</LD>
<LD>   The medical board licenses, monitors and disciplines physicians. The
agency also is where thousands of patients turn when evaluating and
selecting doctors.</LD>
<TE>   In some cases, the agency said it was unaware of the decisions partly
because it was not informed by court clerks and insurance agencies.</TE>
<TE>   "Not everything that is reportable is being reported," said Medical
Board spokeswoman Candis Cohen.</TE>

<HD>Fred Taylor, 77; Longtime Basketball Coach at Ohio State</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>COLUMBUS, Ohio
</DL>
<LD>Fred Taylor, who coached an Ohio State team that featured Jerry
Lucas, John Havlicek and a seldom-used sub named Bobby Knight to the 1960
NCAA championship, died Sunday at 77.</LD>
<LD>   Taylor died at a suburban Columbus nursing facility where he had lived
since suffering a brain aneurysm in 1996. He had a heart attack a year
later.</LD>
<LD>   "Fred Taylor was an absolute giant in coaching," said a tearful
Knight, longtime Indiana coach now at Texas Tech. "You could have no way
played for a better coach in college from whom you learned more and in no
way could have had a better friend.</LD>
<TE>   "What's my team? My team is an extension of his team."</TE>
<TE>   Havlicek credited his Hall of Fame career with the Boston Celtics to
Taylor's teaching, commenting: "I don't think I would have gotten
anywhere without his tutelage. My career was based on what I learned from
Fred Taylor. He shaped me tremendously."</TE>
<TE>   National college coach of the year in 1961 and 1962, Taylor led his
alma mater to seven Big Ten titles during his 18 years as coach.</TE>
<TE>   Taylor's last public appearance came in 1998 at the final game played
in St. John Arena. He received a long standing ovation as he was pushed
to center court in a wheelchair. Ohio State named a room in its new arena
after Taylor.</TE>
<TE>   Taylor's .778 winning percentage in NCAA tournament games is the
eighth highest, and his teams were 14-4 in the tournament. His career
record was 297-158 when he retired after the 1975-76 season--before
turning 50.</TE>
<TE>   Taylor starred on the 1950 Big Ten basketball championship team at
Ohio State. He became the Buckeyes' freshmen coach in 1954 and regular
coach in 1958.</TE>
<TE>   He won the NCAA title in 1960 and took teams to the championship game
the next two years--a feat matched only by UCLA's John Wooden,
Cincinnati's Ed Jucker and Duke's Mike Krzyzewski.</TE>
<TE>   Ohio State defeated California 75-55 in San Francisco for the 1960
title, but lost the championship game the next two years to Cincinnati.
The Bearcats beat Ohio State 70-65 in overtime in 1961 and 71-59 in 1962.</TE>
<TE>   All five starters on the 1960 team went on to the NBA: Jerry Lucas,
John Havlicek, Larry Siegfried, Mel Nowell and Joe Roberts.</TE>
<TE>   "I had a love affair with those kids," Taylor said. "They weren't very
sound defensively at the start of the season. As they progressed, they
could play pretty thorny defense."</TE>
<TE>   His 1968 team finished third in the tournament. Two other times, Ohio
State teams coached by Taylor were denied a spot in the NCAA tournament
because the Big Ten allowed only one team to advance. The team with the
most recent tournament appearance was eliminated.</TE>
<TE>   Ohio State won its last Big Ten title under Taylor in 1971 and
finished second in 1972.</TE>
<TE>   Taylor was the coach during a 1972 game against Minnesota in which
center Luke Witte was knocked to the floor and stomped by the Gophers'
Corky Taylor and Ron Behagen. Other Buckeyes were chased from the floor,
with objects thrown at them.</TE>
<TE>   The Minnesota players were never disciplined. Taylor was bitter that
the Big Ten did not take stronger action and his administration did not
push for stiffer penalties.</TE>
<TE>   "I just didn't have as much enthusiasm after 1972," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Several of his former players--Don DeVoe, Jim Cleamons and
Knight--later became successful coaches.</TE>
<TE>   Knight and Havlicek presented Taylor for induction into the Basketball
Hall of Fame in 1986.</TE>
<TE>   Taylor later worked as an NBC commentator and was an assistant coach
on the 1979 U.S. basketball team that won the gold medal at the Pan
American Games. He managed a golf club from 1979 until his illness in
1996.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to his wife of 54 years, Eileen, Taylor is survived by
four daughters, Janna Roewer, Krista Zimmerman, Nikki Kelley and Sharla
Peponis, and 12 grandchildren.</TE>

<HD>Thomas Estes, 88; Envoy to Upper Volta Under Kennedy</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Former U.S. Ambassador Thomas Stuart Estes, 88, who attended
President John F. Kennedy's last official Oval Office meeting before his
assassination, died Tuesday at the Freedom Village Nursing Center in
Bradenton, Fla., of natural causes.</LD>
<LD>   Estes was the first U.S. ambassador to West Africa's Republic of Upper
Volta, now known as Burkina Faso, from 1961 until a coup there in 1966.
He met with Kennedy in November 1963 just before Kennedy left for the
trip to Dallas during which he was assassinated.</LD>
<LD>   Raised in rural Maine, Estes joined the Marines in 1934 and served at
the U.S. Embassy in Beijing. He later worked for the American Legation in
Thailand, until the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor in 1941, and Estes and
his new wife were taken prisoners of war. They were later exchanged for
Japanese prisoners of war.</LD>
<TE>   Estes naturalized non-American soldiers fighting with the U.S. Army in
World War II and won an Army Bronze Star for bravery for naturalizing 800
people in North Africa and Italy under heavy artillery bombardment. He
later served at the State Department in Washington, D.C., and at age 60
earned his college degree from the University of Rhode Island.</TE>

<HD>Thomas Sebeok, 81; Linguist Debunked Theory About Apes</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MYRNA OLIVER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Thomas A. Sebeok, who gained international attention by debunking
optimistic theories that chimpanzees and other apes could learn and
communicate in human language and by proposing the use of a "Tutankhamen
phenomenon" to warn people away from nuclear waste sites, has died. He
was 81.</LD>
<LD>   Sebeok, a prolific author and professor of anthropology, linguistics
and semiotics at Indiana University from 1943 to 1991, died Dec. 21 of
leukemia at his home in Bloomington, Ind.</LD>
<LD>   Above all a linguist, Sebeok expanded thinking about various forms of
communication, including the field he pioneered called semiotics, or the
analysis of signs in language and communication. Despite what one
advertising expert called "the discipline's fearsome terminology,"
Sebeok's science intrigued people such as military and governmental
leaders, advertising executives and zookeepers with its applications to
their widely varied problems.</LD>
<TE>   Sebeok, who wrote and edited more than 60 books, published his first,
"Spoken Hungarian," in 1944 for the U.S. Armed Forces Institute. He
maintained a long association with the military, teaching those in
uniform Eastern European and Asian languages and particularly Russian. He
headed Indiana University's Air Force Language Training Program for more
than a decade.</TE>
<TE>   As various anthropologists posited the concept of teaching human
language to chimps and other apes, further connecting the animals to
mankind's family tree, Sebeok set out to prove them wrong. Through his
books, such as "Animal Communication," which he wrote in 1968, and
"Speaking of Apes," which he edited with his wife, Jean Umiker-Sebeok, in
1980, Sebeok said his research proved that apes lacked the necessary
organs--such as vocal cords--for language. Furthermore, he said, they
lacked the intelligence or physical means to pass language along to their
offspring.</TE>
<TE>   In the early 1980s, Sebeok was part of a team of nuclear physicists,
linguists, engineers, psychologists and others appointed by the Nuclear
Regulatory Commission to devise warnings for proposed burial sites for
radioactive garbage. According to the mandate, such signs must survive
the inevitable evolution of language for 10,000 years, the expected
duration of the radiation danger.</TE>
<TE>   Sebeok proposed a three-pronged system, beginning with the posting of
durable danger markers or signs containing words and cartoon pictures.
Secondly, he suggested, sites should be inspected every century and the
posted warnings updated in current parlance.</TE>
<TE>   But it was his third suggestion that attracted the most attention, and
even some ridicule. He said an "atomic priesthood" of scientists and
scholars, with new ones appointed to replace those who died, should pass
along myths of evil spirits akin to the "curse of the pharaohs" to thwart
trespassing by any humans unable to read. He called the theory the
"Tutankhamen phenomenon," alluding to supposed curses protecting the
Egyptian boy pharaoh's tomb discovered by archeologist Howard Carter
eight decades ago.</TE>
<TE>   Business, like government, was interested in Sebeok's work. When his
collection of essays titled "A Sign Is Just a Sign" was published in
1991, the American Marketing Assn.'s Journal of Marketing urged members
to read "this difficult book." Why?</TE>
<TE>   "Because," wrote a reviewer, "the book's new and exciting ideas about
communication stretch the mind [and] offer a stimulating and satisfying
mental aerobics workout. On a more practical level, Sebeok's ideas also
have provocative implications for marketing theory and practice."</TE>
<TE>   A greater understanding of nonverbal pictorial signs, the reviewer
explained, could greatly aid international marketing and help avoid
deceptive advertising practices.</TE>
<TE>   Sebeok, who was born in Budapest, Hungary, had a lawyer-economist for
a father. The boy left to study at Cambridge and came to the United
States when he was 17. He earned his bachelor's degree at the University
of Chicago and master's and doctorate degrees from Princeton, then
settled in to teach, conduct research and write at Indiana University.</TE>
<TE>   Sebeok was founding chairman of its Uralic and Altaic studies
department, chairman of its Research Center for Language and Semiotic
Studies and chairman of its graduate program in semiotic studies.</TE>
<TE>   During his long career, Sebeok was a visiting professor at 33
educational institutions in 17 countries, among them California's
Stanford University and the Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral
Sciences.</TE>
<TE>   Among Sebeok's myriad awards was the somewhat whimsical Nobuhara Award
from the Japan Sherlock Holmes Club in 1982. The group paid homage to the
book Sebeok had written a year or so earlier with his wife, "You Know My
Method: A Juxtaposition of Charles S. Peirce and Sherlock Holmes."</TE>
<TE>   Sebeok is survived by his wife and collaborator, Jean Umiker-Sebeok; a
daughter from his first marriage; and two daughters from his second
marriage.</TE>

<HD>Bill Parker, 64; Film Editor Worked on 'Columbo' TV Shows</HD>
<DH></DH>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Bill Parker, 64, motion picture and television film editor who
worked with Peter Falk on his two-hour television specials of "Columbo,"
died Friday of lung cancer at Providence St. Joseph Medical Center in
Burbank.</LD>
<LD>   Born in Pittsburgh, Parker began his career as a rock 'n' roll singer
and recording artist. But when he moved to Los Angeles in 1961, he
switched to film editing, beginning as an assistant at Todd-AO Studios.
In addition to his work with Falk, he edited such television series as
"Emergency," "Centennial" and "MacGyver" and miniseries and television
movies including "Peter the Great" and "Survival of Spaceship Earth."</LD>
<LD>   In the early 1990s, Parker was put under contract by Jim Choi,
president and owner of Fu Nagai Film Productions, to create the film
"Shanghai 1920." Shot entirely in Shanghai, the film was completed in
Hong Kong and Japan.</LD>
<TE>   After returning to Hollywood, Parker edited the Emmy-winning "A
Promise Kept: The Oksana Baiul Story" and several "Columbo" productions.
His most recent credit was last year's "Columbo: Murder with Too Many
Notes."</TE>

<HD>Winter Games in L.A.? We Could Warm to That Idea</HD>
<DH></DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>\o7 When I started the Kings, I was told there were a
quarter-million ex-Canadians in L.A. Now I know why they left Canada.
They hate hockey.</LD>
<LD>\f7    --Jack Kent Cooke</LD>
<LD>   *</LD>
<TE>   That's a famous quote around here, pretty funny at the time Cooke said
it, but we won't be including it in our promotional material.</TE>
<TE>   We won't be mentioning the Mighty Ducks or Tony Tavares, either. We're
pretending that never happened. No, we'll be talking up the 1993 Stanley
Cup finals and how hockey totally transfixed this town (we won't be
mentioning Bruce McNall) and we'll be going heavy on how Wayne Gretzky
played here (we won't be mentioning Marty McSorley) and how Michelle Kwan
and Linda Fratianne and Tai Babilonia and Randy Gardner grew up here (we
won't be mentioning Wild Wing) and how Olympic freestyle skiing gold
medalist Nikki Stone lives here (we won't be mentioning the stoned
freestyle skiers at Big Bear on Christmas break) and how the Zamboni was
invented here (we won't be mentioning the speed of traffic on the 405 on
a rainy February day).</TE>
<TE>   We've been thwarted in our attempt to bring the 2012 Summer Olympics
to Los Angeles, because the U.S. Olympic Committee thought we were too
arrogant, which was strange, because people living in Los Angeles will
tell you they're exceedingly humble and modest, and if the USOC truly
believes Houston, Washington, New York and San Francisco are better
potential Summer Olympic sites than L.A., they're a lot dumber than we
thought in the first place.</TE>
<TE>   We've been thwarted, but not defeated, and that is why we've shelved
the Summer Games for the time being and set our sights on another prize.</TE>
<TE>   The Winter Olympics, of course.</TE>
<TE>   We're in training for them, right now, as we speak.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. Figure Skating Championships at Staples Center this week?
They're our Olympic trials.</TE>
<TE>   The NHL All-Star game at Staples on Feb. 2? Our test run for North
America versus the world a few Olympiads down the line.</TE>
<TE>   "We've talked about it," says Rich Perelman, who drew up the bid for
the failed LA2012 campaign. "A couple of us got together over dinner and
we actually thought about it, because we didn't know when the next
opportunity would be for the U.S. to have Summer Games. And as you can
see, there's already a strong prejudice against us for having Summer
Games.</TE>
<TE>   "So we thought about a Winter Games. And, you know, there's no problem
to hold all of the arena events. And we would go to Big Bear and Mammoth
for the skiing events. The real sticking point was going to be where do
we put the ski jumping and where do we put the bob and luge track? And
we'd probably have to build that, which is what Utah did.</TE>
<TE>   "But we actually toyed with it. As a matter a fact, I mentioned it to
[LA2012 President] David Simon after we got eliminated. I said, 'These
clowns eliminated us, we ought to go for the Winter Games."'</TE>
<TE>   Why not? We already have our marketing slogan prepared: "You Think
We're Crazy? Hey, They Gave Atlanta The Summer Games, Didn't They?"</TE>
<TE>   Actually, we have another: "Where Would You Rather Spend Three Weeks
In February--Salt Lake City Or Here?"</TE>
<TE>   We have the ice rinks. In fact, we're up to our axels in ice rinks. We
have Staples and the Forum and their heritage of fine major-league
hockey. We have the Pond and the Long Beach Arena and their heritage of
fine minor-league hockey.</TE>
<TE>   We have the mountains. Big Bear to the east, Mammoth to the north, the
Matterhorn to the south.</TE>
<TE>   Ski jumping could be held at the Coliseum, which sounds a little
weird, but really would be nothing new.</TE>
<TE>   "I've seen some old footage of it," says Simon, who also serves as
president of the Los Angeles Sports Council. "The Coliseum, at least
once, hosted the Olympic trials for the U.S. team for ski jumping....
They set up a jump and they were actually jumping across the length of
the field."</TE>
<TE>   Or, Perelman suggests, "maybe we could do a joint bid with Las Vegas.
We could hold ski jumping there and they'd just jump right over the
Strip.</TE>
<TE>   "The ski jump federation two years ago actually asked me, 'Where could
we put a demonstration, a summer-type event?' Clearly, you put it in
Vegas. And you ski right into the Sphinx....</TE>
<TE>   "It seems to me that having people ski-jumping over the desert in Las
Vegas, that's kind of the visual that you want. You know? You have the
volcano blowing up and then the guy just kind of bisects it as he's
coming over it."</TE>
<TE>   Bobsled and luge? Perelman suspects Las Vegas or Anaheim could handle
that.</TE>
<TE>   "Maybe we would put the bobsled on an elevated strip over Las Vegas
Boulevard," he says. "And the losers then just keep going to Los Angeles.
Either that, or you could put it at Disneyland. They're building all that
new stuff. I mean, make it an attraction, right?</TE>
<TE>   "There's every opportunity to put together something like this, and to
have a fabulous Winter Games. I mean, this thing is about entertainment.
You want entertainment, I think you could have a combination of the glory
of the Winter Games combined with the gore of the French Revolution."</TE>
<TE>   We're brainstorming here. Throwing ideas against the wall, running
them up the flagpole.</TE>
<TE>   "One thing we can't offer is that snowy setting for the opening
ceremony," Simon says. "On the other hand, we can offer the best golf
accommodations in the history of the Winter Olympics. For those days
off."</TE>
<TE>   Let's timetable it then. Turin, Italy, has already booked 2006.
Vancouver is going hard after 2010. The International Olympic Committee
probably figures to go away from North America in 2014.</TE>
<TE>   After that?</TE>
<TE>   "We're forming the 3012 bid committee," Simon quips. "The next Ice
Age."</TE>
<TE>   Perelman is more the optimist.</TE>
<TE>   "Seriously, at some point, this is probably going to happen," he says.
"It's probably going to be at least 20, 30 years. But at some point, on a
more serious level, the IOC--and there are people who recognize it
now--will recognize that the Winter Games, given the current schedule
that they have and the paucity of events that they've got, they simply
cannot afford the kind of [television] rights fees that they're asking
for in the kind of environment they've had.</TE>
<TE>   "They are going to cities now, not to villages. The view is widely
espoused that Lillehammer is the last village to host the Games. You're
going to a mid-major city in the United States in Salt Lake City. You're
going to a first-class Italian city in Turin. I don't know where they're
going to go in 2010, but if they go to Whistler Mountain, you're talking
essentially about going to Vancouver, another major city in North
America.</TE>
<TE>   "When you go into these cities, which have all the infrastructure of
stadiums and arenas and so on, it seems to me that sports that really get
the short shrift in the Summer Games--like fencing, wrestling,
weightlifting, team handball--would be tailor-made to be brought into the
Winter Games. They would be the stars--after figure skating, of
course--they would be the absolute stars."</TE>
<TE>   Current IOC guidelines require all Winter Olympic sports to be
conducted either on snow or ice, but a few years back, IOC executive Marc
Hodler began lobbying for the inclusion of his favorite pastime, bridge,
in the Winter Games. Chess and ballroom dancing are also banging on the
Olympic door, and if the Summer Games want no part of them, the Winter
Games, nudged along by networks clamoring for more to televise than
biathlon and short-track speedskating, could become their ultimate
refuge.</TE>
<TE>   "When you say 'Los Angeles and the Winter Games' right now, it's a
ha-ha," Perelman says. "But I think when the Winter Games [accept] this
concept that they should [include] sports that are practiced in the
winter--basketball would be another example--and not sports that are
simply on snow and ice, I think there is a real opportunity to say, 'You
know, we really ought to be considering what sports ought to be moved
from the Summer Games into the Winter Games....</TE>

<DH>The U.S. Figure Skating Championships, Starting Tuesday at Staples
Center, Promise to Deliver a Week of...</DH>

<AU>HELENE ELLIOTT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Her audience consists of about a dozen skaters and about as many
parents and coaches clustered near a heating unit, but Michelle Kwan
doesn't see them.</LD>
<LD>   So intent is her concentration, she could be at center ice before a
panel of Olympic judges and thousands of spectators instead of on the
glassy rink at the Ice Castle International Training Center in Lake
Arrowhead, as she is on this late December day.</LD>
<LD>   The background blur of jumps and spins freezes to a still-life tableau
as she assumes the pose for the start of her program. She strokes
smoothly to build speed, her face coloring from exertion. Her combination
jump is crisp and clean, her layback spin supple, her spiral steady. The
skaters at the edges of the rink unabashedly enjoy watching her in her
splendid solitude. They're as eager as any fan to get a preview of how
she will perform in the U.S. championships this week at Staples Center
and a month from now at the Salt Lake City Winter Olympics.</LD>
<TE>   When she finishes, there's applause, muffled by gloves and mittens.
Kwan cools down, breathing hard in the 5,500-foot altitude. It's a
satisfying session--two clean programs, no wasted time and a sense of
accomplishment.</TE>
<TE>   "It feels good," the 21-year-old Torrance native says. "One week here
seems like two months down there. You get a lot of work done, and you
have a lot of solid time on the ice. I have access to the rink on
weekends. It's very convenient."</TE>
<TE>   "Down there" is HealthSouth Training Center in El Segundo, her
previous training base. She has been skating almost exclusively at Lake
Arrowhead since November, or shortly after parting with longtime coach
Frank Carroll.</TE>
<TE>   She has created a routine within a cocoon of family and friends. And
if that seems to contradict the reason she offered for leaving Carroll--a
need to take control of her life and her skating--she doesn't see it.</TE>
<TE>   "What is independence? Am I going to move all alone to a city?" she
asks. "In some ways, independence comes from within, how you make
decisions and how you act. That's what I call independence."</TE>
<TE>   Freedom--whether artistic, physical or emotional--is a central theme
of her life. It's why she became enchanted by skating when she was 7,
after seeing Brian Boitano's unfettered power and artistry as he won the
gold medal at the 1988 Olympics. It's why she gave up gymnastics, after a
coach bound her feet and told her to do a flip, not knowing she hated
restraints.</TE>
<TE>   "I said, 'Are you serious? You're tying my feet here, you know that?"'
she recalls.</TE>
<TE>   And it's why she ended her nearly decade-long relationship with
Carroll, for the freedom to obey her instincts as she pursues her sixth
U.S. championship and a chance to win the gold medal that eluded her at
Nagano in 1998.</TE>
<TE>   No elite skater has competed without a coach under such pressure. And
Kwan has yet to produce an unassailable performance this season. She has
won only one of five events--a hotly debated decision over an impressive
Sarah Hughes at Skate America--and finished third at Skate Canada, her
first placement lower than second in a major event since 1996.</TE>
<TE>   But she has had less than perfect seasons before and prevailed at the
end. She fended off challenges from teen phenoms Sasha Cohen in 2000 and
Naomi Nari Nam in 1999, and from a resurgent Irina Slutskaya of Russia at
last year's World Championships.</TE>
<TE>   Kwan won her first world and U.S. titles in 1996, but lost both to
upstart Tara Lipinski in 1997. Fighting back, Kwan regained her national
title in 1998, recording 15 of a possible 18 perfect 6s for presentation
in her two programs, despite having missed three weeks of training
because of a stress fracture in her foot.</TE>
<TE>   At the Nagano Olympics, she was the leader after the short program and
was considered as close to a sure thing as anyone could be in a slippery
sport. She doesn't know why, but she held back almost imperceptibly in an
otherwise splendid long program, "just a little gasp of air." Given a
small opening, Lipinski burst through for the gold.</TE>
<TE>   "I remember there was one part of the program where I felt a lot of
freedom, and something went a little uncomfortable and I held back, and
that could be the difference," Kwan says. "I held back in emotions."</TE>
<TE>   Her graceful acceptance of the outcome probably earned her more
admirers and endorsements than if she had won.</TE>
<TE>   She did win the 1998 world title, albeit over a field weakened by
Lipinski's absence. Russia's Maria Butyrskaya topped her in 1999, but
Kwan won the next two world championships, each time silencing critics
who said she had become stagnant and had fallen behind Slutskaya in her
technical prowess.</TE>
<TE>   But each year brings another call to reinvent herself. Kwan tried to
escape an artistic rut last summer by asking Sarah Kawahara to
choreograph her long program instead of Lori Nichol, who'd designed the
Rachmaninov short program Kwan performed in 1998 and resurrected for this
week's competition and the Olympics. When she parted with Carroll as
well, no one knew what to make of it. Carroll still professes to be
puzzled.</TE>
<TE>   "We've all had our coaching melees. We've all had our disputes ..."
said Christopher Bowman, a talented but undisciplined two-time U.S.
champion and two-time world medalist who studied with Carroll in the
1970s and '80s. "But nobody, under any circumstances, should go to a
major championship, especially the Olympics, without a coach."</TE>
<TE>   Nichol, who knows Kwan well, cautioned against such generalizations.
"In this sport, you have to get past the brouhaha and realize it's about
a person," she said. "The only person that has to handle all these
changes is Michelle."</TE>
<TE>   Besides, who can say it's impossible to win at the Olympics without a
coach if no one has tried?</TE>
<TE>   "I can understand her need for more control and independence," 1992
Olympic gold medalist Kristi Yamaguchi said soon after Kwan had split
with Carroll. "It's probably earth-shattering because no one has done it
before, but Michelle has proved time and time again she can handle it.</TE>
<TE>   "If this is where her heart is ... "</TE>
<TE>   It is.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm comfortable. I've gotten used to the idea," Kwan says over a cup
of decaf in a Lake Arrowhead coffee shop. "It's been what I hoped it
would be. I made my decision based on how I felt. A lot of people thought
it was hard-headed and, in a lot of ways, I am hard-headed because this
is the way I want it and this is how I see it. Whether other people
question me or not, as long as I feel it's right, that's what matters."</TE>
<TE>   Clearly, she is no longer the shy, cute 13-year-old who was thrust
into the middle of the Tonya Harding-Nancy Kerrigan mess in 1994. Kwan,
second to Harding at the U.S. Championships after a knee-clubbing forced
Kerrigan to withdraw, was designated an Olympic alternate. Kwan didn't
compete at Lillehammer, but she has occupied figure skating's center
stage ever since.</TE>
<TE>   With five U.S. titles, she trails only Maribel Vinson (nine) and
Gretchen Merrill and Theresa Weld Blanchard (six each) in the U.S. Figure
Skating Assn. record books. One more world title will tie her with Carol
Heiss for most won by a U.S. woman. One more world medal will move her
past Heiss, who won five gold medals and a silver, to Kwan's four golds
and two silvers.</TE>
<TE>   Despite having grown up in public, she has blossomed into a
well-grounded young woman who is exploring the power of her femininity
and her physical and mental limits. Slender at 5 feet 21/2 and 106
pounds--but blessed with to-die-for abdominal muscles she bared in a
photo shoot for International Figure Skating magazine--she's no
lightweight.</TE>
<TE>   She is wise enough to enjoy skating for its own sake, not for a
never-certain reward at the end. She has traveled the globe, sampled life
at UCLA before time pressures led her to put school on hold, and become
involved in her first serious romance, with Florida Panther defenseman
Brad Ference.</TE>
<TE>   She is driven to excel, to be remembered. But because she knows there
is infinitely more to life than skating, winning the gold medal at Salt
Lake City is not the be-all, end-all for her.</TE>
<TE>   "It used to be," she says. "I'm glad it sort of happened this way. I'm
not glad [to place second at Nagano], but I'm happy with staying amateur
and staying [in Olympic-eligible events] another four years. I could have
easily gone professional, but I wouldn't have experienced the three world
titles [won after Nagano]. Some people say, 'You won one, that's enough.'
But for me, it's the duration of my career. You experience things. Each
worlds was different for me, at different parts of my life ...</TE>
<TE>   "I'm different than I was yesterday. I'm always changing. I don't feel
like I've been waiting around for [Salt Lake City]."</TE>
<TE>   Kwan started skating when she was 5, copying her hockey-playing
brother. Transfixed by Boitano in 1988, she turned an interest into a
passion, giving up gymnastics, ballet and tap dance.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it's the freedom of skating, the beauty of being able to
combine athleticism and beauty in one sport," says Kwan, who won her
first competition at 7. "You rarely see that."</TE>
<TE>   She climbed through the ranks with astonishing speed. After sneaking
behind Carroll's back to take her senior level test--he wanted her to
spend more time as a junior--she finished sixth at her first senior U.S.
Championships in 1993. She was second in 1994 and eighth at her first
senior World Championships in 1994. She also won the 1994 world junior
title.</TE>
<TE>   "It doesn't feel like a lifetime ago, yet when I break it down, I've
grown so much," says Kwan, who has videotapes of all her competitions and
occasionally watches them.</TE>
<TE>   She makes no apologies for not severing the umbilical cord to her
family, or for her father's ubiquitous presence. Danny, who declined to
be interviewed, attends her practices and competitions but has said he's
not coaching her, although all evidence points otherwise.</TE>
<TE>   "Why cut a good relationship?" she says. "I could see it if it was
overbearing."</TE>
<TE>   Bowman, however, claims Kwan's family gave her a false sense of
security before Nagano, undermining her chances. He also theorized that
she dumped Carroll to create doubts about her prospects and make herself
an underdog at Salt Lake City, knowing that she has always been
successful at fighting back from positions of supposed weakness.</TE>
<TE>   "They built her up so big and puffed her up so much and put her on a
pedestal so high that when she fell, it was like falling off the Empire
State Building," he said, later adding: "What they did is set her up for
disaster, her father and the people around her saying Tara Lipinski could
never beat her."</TE>
<TE>   Kwan disputes the perception that she was blindsided by Lipinski or is
making herself an underdog to manufacture motivation.</TE>
<TE>   "I did know of Tara and I did know of her triple-triples. I wasn't
unprepared. You could never prepare for somebody." Skating well this week
is her main focus. Besides retreating to Lake Arrowhead, another piece of
her plan has been breaking in new boots. It's a crucial process and she's
picky about them, especially since flimsy boots weakened her performances
in 1997.</TE>
<TE>   She is also deciding whether to change some jumps in her "Sheherezade"
long program, knowing a tenth of a point on the technical mark could
dictate her placement.</TE>
<TE>   Her artistry has long been her strong point, a luminous grace and
innate feel for music that is unmatched among her peers. Her edging,
spirals, flow and command of the ice are exemplary, but she might need to
up the ante technically. She's thinking of supplementing her triple toe
loop, triple toe loop combination with a triple lutz-triple toe loop or a
tougher triple lutz-triple loop. Her final choice will dictate which
other jumps she performs.</TE>
<TE>   Whatever her choices, they will be made with the idea of allowing her
the freedom to give everything emotionally, unlike Nagano.</TE>
<TE>   "That's what I'm hoping," she says, "to give myself another chance,
maybe be stronger and wiser and bolder."</TE>

<LD>Defending U.S. men's figure skating champion Tim Goebel got his
first feel for the ice at Staples Center Sunday and pronounced it
good--but cramped.</LD>
<LD>   Goebel skated at Staples about a week or so ago, before the ice was
thickened by about a half-inch to accommodate skaters digging toe picks
into the ice for jumps.</LD>
<LD>   In addition, he trains in El Segundo on an international-size rink,
which at 200 feet long and 100 feet wide is 15 feet wider than NHL rinks
such as Staples. "Hockey ice is different, but this is nice," Goebel
said. "It is small, but you can't do anything about that."</LD>
<TE>   Goebel, vying for one of three men's singles spots on the U.S. Olympic
team, might train at altitude before the Salt Lake City Games to become
accustomed to the thin air. "\o7 If\f7  I make it," he said.</TE>
<TE>   If?</TE>
<TE>   "Well," he said, "you never know."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Staples Center spokesman Michael Roth said fans attending the
championships should leave extra travel time because of congestion around
the area. The Auto Show is taking place at the nearby Convention Center.</TE>
<TE>   He also said fans should allow time for going through security
procedures at the arena. Everyone entering the building must walk through
a metal detector, and all bags will be subject to search.</TE>
<TE>   "Anything bigger than a small briefcase won't be allowed in," he said,
but added a diaper bag would be permitted.</TE>
<TE>   Also, while it's OK to bring small cameras (without flashes), Fire
Department rules prohibit large signs and banners.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Goebel drew the 14th starting position in the 18-man field for the
men's short program Tuesday. Todd Eldredge will skate fourth and Michael
Weiss ninth. Among the women, Michelle Kwan will skate second Thursday as
she tries for her fifth consecutive U.S. title and sixth overall. Sarah
Hughes will skate fourth, Angela Nikodinov fifth and Sasha Cohen 14th.</TE>

<DH>Goebel Always Had Jumps Down, Now Style Is Coming Around</DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In creating programs for figure skaters, choreographer Lori Nichol
seeks what she calls "a lightbulb moment," the magical instant a skater
grasps the elements of artistry, athleticism and music and fuses them
into consistent performances.</LD>
<LD>   Nichol recalls Michelle Kwan experiencing that epiphany in 1996,
before winning the first of her four world titles. "There's that
beautiful moment, when the skater says, 'Ohhhh,"' Nichol said.</LD>
<LD>   U.S. men's champion Tim Goebel hasn't had his lightbulb moment yet.
His finger is on the switch. But his skating, although packed with
crowd-pleasing quadruple-jump pyrotechnics and an increasing affinity for
his music, hasn't been illuminated by the depth and feeling that
distinguish the sport's elite.</LD>
<TE>   "I think with any kind of learning, first it's about hearing what
you're being taught, understanding, making your body do it, and making it
so consistent that it's natural," said Nichol, who works with Goebel and
world pair champions Jamie Sale and David Pelletier of Canada, among
others.</TE>
<TE>   "That's a process. He's definitely at the 'understanding and making
the body do it' stage. Every single time out there he takes huge leaps
forward. He's a very smart athlete, and he knows how far he can push
himself on the ice without affecting the technical end and his jumping.
Only the best skaters in the world can do that."</TE>
<TE>   Goebel, who trains in El Segundo with a coaching team led by Frank
Carroll, has the technical ability to compete with Russians Evgeni
Plushenko and Alexei Yagudin, winners of the last four world
championships. After he left longtime coach Carol Heiss Jenkins in
mid-2000 to work with Carroll, Goebel battled daily to get his mind and
body in sync.</TE>
<TE>   He wanted to become a skater who does difficult jumps, not a jumper
who skates between leaps.</TE>
<TE>   "My strength is obviously my technical ability. I'm still doing more
than anybody else," said Goebel, the first U.S. skater to land a
quadruple jump in competition, the first to land a quadruple salchow, the
first to land a quad salchow, triple jump combination in competition and
the first to land three quads in one program. He accomplished those feats
within the past four years.</TE>
<TE>   "My artistry is definitely the weaker side of my skating, but I think
I've made huge strides."</TE>
<TE>   Goebel (pronounced "Gable") has worked hard enough to believe his
lightbulb moment might occur at this week's U.S. Figure Skating
Championships at Staples Center. With a berth at the Salt Lake City
Winter Games at stake, there could be no better time for him to
demonstrate he has mastered not simply the grand gestures of his sport,
but the subtle nuances of his craft.</TE>
<TE>   "The first year we worked together was very difficult because he was
extremely sore and extremely cranky because of being put through the mill
by everybody, and having everybody picking on him," Carroll said. "He's
somebody who probably went from an environment where he was told he was
really, really good into an environment where everybody was telling him,
'That won't do,' and, 'You can be better, and do this and this and this
much better.' It was a hard year.</TE>
<TE>   "This year with him has been tremendously easier. He grasps it and the
principle involved in what he's trying to do."</TE>
<TE>   Goebel, 21, has had a solid season. A back injury kept him out of the
Goodwill Games in September, but he recovered to easily win Skate America
in October, finish second at Nations Cup in Germany in November and take
third behind Yagudin and Plushenko at last month's Grand Prix Final.</TE>
<TE>   "I think I've set myself up real well to make the [Olympic] team and
hopefully do well at the Olympics," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The top three finishers in the men's event will represent the U.S. at
Salt Lake City, and Goebel's jumping ability and improving expressiveness
virtually assure him a spot. Five-time U.S. champion Todd Eldredge is a
great spinner but can't match Goebel's quads; two-time U.S. champion
Michael Weiss is also inferior technically and has had a rocky season. No
one else approaches their level.That leaves this week and this moment for
Goebel. Yet, he insisted that repeating as champion is the least of his
concerns.</TE>
<TE>   "I want to go into nationals and try to skate two solid programs," he
said. "If it's second or third, I don't care ... I have a long career
ahead of me, and I'm really not worried about winning another national
championship this year."</TE>
<TE>   Carroll believes the title and a medal are possible.</TE>
<TE>   "There's nobody in the world who can do quads as easily as Tim,"
Carroll said. "It would be great to win a bronze, but if one of those
Russian boys slips up [he could benefit]. They've both been world
champions, but Plushenko self-destructed at Nice at worlds [in 2000], and
I saw Yagudin self-destruct twice, once at Skate America [in 2000]
against Tim and the other time at the Goodwill Games this year. It's not
like they're unbeatable or it's not possible."</TE>
<TE>   Adopted as an infant by Ginny and Rick Goebel, Timothy grew up in
Rolling Meadows, Ill., near Chicago. His parents took their only child to
a suburban mall for ice skating lessons but exposed him to other sports
and to music. He liked skating best, and his slender frame helped him
rotate quickly and learn difficult jumps. To further his training, his
parents sent him to the Cleveland suburb of Lakewood, Ohio, when he was
11 to work with Heiss Jenkins, the 1960 Olympic women's gold medalist,
and her associate, Glyn Watts.</TE>
<TE>   His mother moved with him, as she later moved to Los Angeles to take
care of off-ice logistics. His father, an engineer, lives at the family
home "and pays for my skating," Goebel said, laughing.</TE>
<TE>   Both parents shy away from the spotlight; Carroll recalled having seen
Ginny Goebel only twice at HealthSouth training center. She attends her
son's competitions but routinely foils efforts to capture her reactions
on TV by avoiding the seats designated for her and finding a place among
the crowd.</TE>
<TE>   "This is all his drive, not his parents'," said Goebel's agent, Lee
Marshall.</TE>
<TE>   Goebel's drive carried him to success on the ice as well as academic
honors at Lakewood High. He won the U.S. junior championship in 1996, at
15, and was second in the world competition the next year. He was sixth
at his first senior-level U.S. championships in 1997, and after missing
the 1998 event, moved up to third and second the next two seasons.</TE>
<TE>   After the 2000 championships in Cleveland, near his training base, he
dismissed Heiss Jenkins and took Watts with him to the world
championships, where he finished 11th. Although skating insiders said
there had been tension between Goebel and Heiss Jenkins, Goebel said
there was no single cause for the split.</TE>
<TE>   "We had just reached a point where she had been sort of, needing to
look at things from a different point of view," he said. "I like Carol.
She really wanted the best for me. I just think she didn't really know
how to go about it. She is a great coach, and she's had a lot of success
over the years and had a lot of competitors at worlds. From my
perspective, Frank is a better coach."</TE>
<TE>   Heiss Jenkins said she had no hint Goebel was about to end their
relationship: "We didn't have an upset or anything like that. It was just
him telling me, 'I don't want you to go to worlds,' and he went with Glyn
Watts. And then he left. I had always thought and hoped he could be on
the podium at Salt Lake City. He's a very talented jumper, no doubt about
it."</TE>
<TE>   Goebel approached Carroll in the spring of 2000, but Carroll had
several factors to consider. One was whether Goebel was receptive to
learning how to refine his posture and style. Equally important was
whether Kwan, then Carroll's main pupil, would agree. Kwan dismissed
Carroll in October but said Goebel's presence was not related to her
decision.</TE>
<TE>   Carroll is stern and exacting, but Goebel knew he needed structure.
Sometimes that first season Goebel was too sore to skate, so strenuous
was his training to improve his jumping technique and overall style.</TE>
<TE>   "If you've learned a quadruple salchow and you're all bent over and
you can do it, and then somebody says, 'That's not right. You're going to
do your quadruple salchow with a straight back,' it's tough. You think,
'I can't do that because that's not my balance point.' It was difficult
because he was finding his balance point again," Carroll said. "It was a
gradual process."</TE>
<TE>   The results made the discomfort worthwhile. In his first full season
under Carroll, he won Skate America and the U.S. title and finished
fourth at the world championships, his highest placement.</TE>
<TE>   "Tim is a very intelligent young man, and he recognizes the
intelligence Frank has," Nichol said. "Tim is feeling safe within Frank's
guidance. When you feel safe, you start to really fly."</TE>
<TE>   But can he fly higher than Plushenko and Yagudin?</TE>
<TE>   Goebel, with a confidence that can resemble cockiness, believes
nothing is preordained.</TE>
<TE>   "The gap is definitely narrowing. Myself and Mike and Todd, we're very
capable of beating them," Goebel said. "They do have a certain definite
sense of style. They do have some charisma, but what separated them in
the past isn't separating them as much. We're improving ....</TE>
<TE>   "If the three of us go, we'd be a really strong team. We've all had
successful national and international careers. I may have a technical
edge, but Tim and Mike have the edge of being former Olympians and being
at this level for a long time."</TE>
<TE>   That's a level he hopes to reach this week. "I don't feel like I'm
defending my title, I'm earning a spot on the Olympic team, and that's
been my dream," Goebel said. "Whether I finish first, second or third, as
long as I get a spot on the Olympic team, I will have accomplished my
goal."</TE>

fourth at the World Championships. Followed with another strong season,
winning Skate America, finishing second at Nations Cup and finishing
third at the Grand Prix Final. A spectacular jumper, he has landed 50
quadruple jumps in competition. He has enhanced his artistry but must
persuade judges he is a complete skater.</TE>
<TE>   TODD ELDREDGE</TE>
<TE>   Lake Angelus, Mich.</TE>
<TE>   * Five-time national champion and 1996 world champion, he has legions
of admirers for his edging and spins. However, without a consistent quad
he can only hope his rivals fall for him to win internationally. The
oldest of the top men's contenders at 30. When he made his debut at U.S.
championships in 1988, Goebel was 7 years old.</TE>
<TE>   MICHAEL WEISS</TE>
<TE>   Fairfax, Va.</TE>
<TE>   * This has been a perplexing season for the two-time U.S. champion and
two-time world bronze medalist. He was second at the Goodwill Games but
fell to fourth at Skate America and eighth at the Nations Cup. Finished
fourth at last year's U.S. championships.</TE>

<HD>Tchernyshev and Lang Rise Above</HD>
<DH>Ice dancing: Since Sept. 11, the two, who rank No. 1 among
Americans, find added meaning in U.S. citizenship.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DIANE PUCIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>On the day he became a U.S. citizen, Peter Tchernyshev's emotions
were jumbled.</LD>
<LD>   "I was so happy," Tchernyshev said, "when I saw the words on the paper
that said I was now an American. Then I was reading more and it said
'former nationality' and 'former citizen' and that word 'former,' for a
moment I felt a little sad too. But I am so proud now to be an American.
This is a very great country."</LD>
<LD>   Tchernyshev became a citizen so he and his partner, Naomi Lang, a
California girl by virtue of her birth in Arcata, could compete in the
2002 Olympics. Lang and Tchernyshev are the best U.S. ice dancing couple.
There is not a close second right now.</LD>
<TE>   The pair have fought through an emotional and painful fall season.
Tchernyshev had shin splints, which forced the couple to withdraw from
all their Grand Prix assignments. But the emotions of the Sept. 11
tragedy made training seem sometimes meaningless and sometimes teary and
that made Tchernyshev so proud to be a U.S. citizen.</TE>
<TE>   The two train in Hackensack, N.J. The balcony of Tchernyshev's
Hackensack apartment looks across the Hudson River to the spot where the
World Trade Center stood. "I would stand and stare across the river and
feel such pain," Tchernyshev said. "When we would come to the rink every
day, we could see where the towers stood. It hurt Naomi so much.</TE>
<TE>   "I think both of us have reevaluated the values in life. We used to
think we had problems every day. But our problems are so insignificant.
Finally, after about three weeks, we knew we had to get back on track
with our skating. We came to the conclusion that the best thing to do was
to skate. It was our way, we could maybe give people some little
happiness."</TE>
<TE>   In the world of ice dancing, where judging is mysterious and good
performances are not always rewarded, Lang and Tchernyshev have
established themselves as consistent crowd pleasers.</TE>
<TE>   Lang, 23, had 15 years of ballet training. She took up skating after
seeing an on-ice production that included skating Smurfs, her favorite
cartoon characters. Tchernyshev, 30, named after his grandfather, a
four-time Russian national singles skater in the late 1930s, came to the
United States in 1992.</TE>
<TE>   "At that time," Tchernyshev said, "the Soviet Union fell apart.
Financing for skating was cut drastically. I needed to find a place to
continue my skating career and to pursue a teaching career."</TE>
<TE>   Tchernyshev went to the Detroit Skating Club to train with Igor
Shpilband and Liz Coates. About five years ago, Tchernyshev and Lang each
split with other partners. Tchernyshev had seen Lang skate at the 1996
U.S. nationals when Lang was a junior. He wrote Lang a letter, asking if
she would like to skate with him. "Naomi had a great look, which is
really an important part of ice dancing," Tchernyshev said. "She has
great lines and great style. In ice dancing aesthetics are something you
must pay attention to."</TE>
<TE>   After training in Detroit, the couple moved to Hackensack in the
summer of 2000 to train with Alexander Zhulin, a two-time Olympic
medalist (one bronze, one silver) with Maia Usova.</TE>
<TE>   "Working with [Zhulin] has been the greatest experience," Lang said.
"He was what we needed. He put fresh breath into our skating. We are so
fortunate get to work with him. He has been to the Olympics and Worlds.
He knows every skater's complications, the hard times skaters go through.
He understands."</TE>
<TE>   Zhulin has a busy schedule. Besides Lang and Tchernyshev, Zhulin also
coaches Jessica Joseph and Brandon Forsyth as well as his wife, Tatiana
Navka and her partner, Roman Kostomarov.</TE>
<TE>   Navka and Kostomarov have already qualified for the Russian Olympic
team. Joseph and Forsyth are among the favorites to take the second U.S.
Olympic spot.</TE>
<TE>   These nationals are important to Lang and Tchernyshev. They must
showcase their programs in front of judges. They must create some buzz.
"We need," Tchernyshev said, "to make sure people remember who we are.
And we are ready."</TE>

<TE>   Greenwich, Conn.</TE>

<TE>   Birmingham, Ala.</TE>
<TE>   * Two-time defending U.S. champions, Ina, who skated with Jason
Dungjen at the 1998 Games and finished fourth, and Zimmerman, who placed
third at the 1997 U.S. Championships with then-partner Stephanie
Stiegler, finished fourth at the 2001 Grand Prix Final last month. They
are heavy favorites to win their third consecutive U.S. title and have
benefited from the coaching of Russian legend Tamara Moskvina.</TE>
<TE>   TIFFANY SCOTT</TE>
<TE>   Hanson, Mass.</TE>
<TE>   and PHILIP DULEBOHN</TE>
<TE>   Germantown, Md.</TE>
<TE>   * Scott and Dulebohn have been runners-up in two consecutive U.S.
Championships and finished 11th at the 2001 World Championships. A stress
fracture in Dulebohn's lower back and left hip forced the pair to
withdraw from the Goodwill Games and miss all of their Grand Prix
assignments this season. But their consecutive silver medals at

<HD>Skating's Odd Couple</HD>
<DH>Zimmerman, Ina Grew Up Worlds Apart but Have Grown Together on the
Ice</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HELENE ELLIOTT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>He's a little bit country, a lanky, slow-talking Alabama native who
craves barbecue, iced tea and leisurely conversations.</LD>
<LD>   She's a little bit city, a sophisticated, blunt-speaking New Yorker
who wants to get places five minutes ago.</LD>
<LD>   U.S. pair figure skating champions John Zimmerman and Kyoko Ina are,
to say the least, an unlikely match. "You think?" Ina said, feigning a
look of surprise.</LD>
<TE>   They got together three years ago because of their skating pedigrees.
Both had done well with other partners--Ina with Jason Dungjen and
Zimmerman with Stephanie Stiegler--and they knew the ropes, but they
didn't know each other.</TE>
<TE>   Over time, they ceased being strangers who happened to share the ice
and learned their differences mattered less than their shared Olympic
dream. They will take a major step toward realizing that dream Wednesday
at Staples Center, when they perform their short program at the U.S.
Figure Skating Championships.</TE>
<TE>   "About as different as New York City and Alabama gets, that's how
different our skating was," said Ina, who won two U.S. titles with
Dungjen and finished fourth with him at the Nagano Olympics but needed a
new partner when he turned pro.</TE>
<TE>   "We were two totally different people trying to skate together, and
yet you saw on paper, national medalist, national medalist, world team
medalist, world team medalist. It was great.</TE>
<TE>   "It's taken three years to actually get to the point where we can say
we're a real couple, and you can see that."</TE>
<TE>   Their 1998 debut at Fort Lauderdale wasn't encouraging. The audience
included an array of U.S. figure skating officials scouting the new duo,
and a nervous Zimmerman forgot what came after their spins.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm counting and swearing we're supposed to go one way down the ice
and we were supposed to be go the other way, apparently," he said. "Kyoko
was going the opposite way. I actually turned around and had to run back.
It was the longest run, with the spotlights and our little outfits and
makeup. It was humbling."</TE>
<TE>   Ina was surprised to see she was skating solo.</TE>
<TE>   "He was coming up behind me," she said, "and of course when I turn
around and he's not there, it's 'OK, where did he go?' "</TE>
<TE>   Their chagrin didn't last long. They won medals at the Trophee Lalique
and Cup of Russia, assuring them they were on the right track. They
finished ninth in their first world championships together, 1999, and
seventh in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Finishing seventh again at last year's world competition, though, was
a shock. Although they were working with one of the top pairs coaches in
the world, Russian Tamara Moskvina, and performing creative lifts, the
judges' marks told them they needed to hone their technique and unison.</TE>
<TE>   "It was like a slap in the face," said Ina, who was born in Japan but
was reared in New York and began skating at Rockefeller Center when she
was 4. "It was, 'You guys have so much potential, but you're not showing
it. You're taking the Alabama route. The I'll get to it in February way,'
and that wasn't working. Even John got to New York [last summer] and said
we're going to have to do something."</TE>
<TE>   That urgency was new for an easygoing guy who learned to skate in a
shopping mall rink in Montgomery, Ala., and stayed with it because he got
to meet cute girls.</TE>
<TE>   "I've been around New York City enough to understand the people and
their mentality," he said. "You've got to fight. You've got to be tough
as nails. You're going to get stepped on, walked on and forgotten if you
don't step it up and show what we've been working so hard for. We've
worked too hard to let it slip by."</TE>
<TE>   Setting aside time for lunch every Tuesday near their training base in
Hackensack, N.J., gave them a forum to air grievances, analyze their
practices and set goals. From those sessions came the idea to use
positive reinforcement to motivate each other to intensify their
training. They're not romantically involved, but they cemented a
friendship and respect.</TE>
<TE>   "We always worked twice as hard as we thought we should have,"
Zimmerman said. "The confidence is there more now this year."</TE>
<TE>   That has been evident in their increasingly sure, emotive
performances. They won silver medals at each of their three Grand Prix
events this season and finished fourth at the Grand Prix Final despite
being the only duo among the six who hadn't previously won a medal at the
world championships.</TE>
<TE>   "For us that's such a great confidence booster," Ina said. "We sort of
wonder if we had only dedicated ourselves this much last year or the year
before, where would we be today? You always wonder. We probably weren't
ready last year to do what we're doing this year. Two years ago there was
no way we could do what we're doing today."</TE>
<TE>   Ending the season on a strong note would provide satisfying closure to
a season that began for them with the horror of watching from afar as the
second World Trade Center tower collapsed.</TE>
<TE>   Ina lives in Greenwich, Conn., but on Sept. 11 was at her parents'
apartment in New Jersey, across the Hudson River from Manhattan. She was
incredulous when her mother, who works in lower Manhattan, called to tell
her a plane had struck one of the towers.</TE>
<TE>   "I looked out and it's beautiful and I thought, 'A plane doesn't hit a
building,' " she said. "Sure enough, there's smoke coming out of the
building and I saw the second [plane] come down the river. I saw it
disappear [behind the tower] and saw it on TV.... It's almost like a
dream, like a bad dream that you don't know if it's real. You can picture
it clearly. It doesn't change. If you dream, things change a little bit.
If you actually see it, you know exactly what you're seeing."</TE>
<TE>   Zimmerman was awakened at his Hackensack apartment by a call from a
distraught friend in Alabama who feared for his safety.</TE>
<TE>   "I ran out of my bedroom and I looked out the window and only saw one
[tower] standing at that time," he said. "The other one had big,
billowing black smoke coming out of it, like a smokestack.</TE>
<TE>   "It's kind of a gross feeling inside to see something like that. It
reminded me if you were to wake up and you don't see your legs anymore
for some reason. Just like it's not there. It doesn't really register. I
was taking a picture of this and the second tower was coming down as I
was taking the photograph."</TE>
<TE>   Ina's mother was unhurt, but she and Zimmerman were shaken for weeks.
They resumed their training and their lives, but they won't forget what
they saw--and they anticipate others affected by the tragedy, directly or
indirectly, will rally around the U.S. flag at Salt Lake City out of
patriotism and respect for the victims.</TE>
<TE>   "I think there will be more support for the Americans because it
affected the world, but it really affected Americans," she said. "I think
it will have a different feeling to it. It won't be so much, 'I hope you
beat so and so,' or anything like that, just be proud really.... They
always say the Olympics are two weeks of just world peace--hopefully."</TE>

<HD>A Golden Moment, a Golden Future</HD>
<DH>Tara Lipinski, With Eyes on a Career in Acting, Is Enjoying Her
Life After Olympics</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HELENE ELLIOTT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Tara Lipinski knows exactly how the competitors at this week's U.S.
Figure Skating Championships feel as they await the moment when they put
their dreams on the line and vie for a national title, as well as a berth
on the Olympic team for the Salt Lake City Games.</LD>
<LD>   "Nervous. Big time nervous," she said. "It's so frustrating because
you want it so bad and you know what you have to do to win, and time
passes so slowly.</LD>
<LD>   "I feel blessed that I did it and accomplished what I wanted to do."</LD>
<TE>   And even more blessed that she's not doing it again.</TE>
<TE>   Four years after she followed a runner-up finish at the 1998 U.S.
championships by upsetting Michelle Kwan and winning the gold medal at
the Nagano Olympics, Lipinski is coping with a hip problem that requires
daily therapy and constant monitoring. Doctors who performed a 31/2-hour
operation to remove torn cartilage overgrowing the bone of her right hip
found the 19-year-old from Sugar Land, Texas, also had developed
arthritis from the years of strain and pounding that led to her golden
moment.</TE>
<TE>   "It's from so much jumping," said Lipinski, who experienced mild pain
at Nagano and was later mistakenly told she had a back injury that would
ease if she strengthened her muscles. "It's called hip dysplasia, from
all the triple-triples I was doing on my right side. I probably would
have been fine after surgery, but because I had skated with it for four
years and was misdiagnosed, there was some cartilage damage....</TE>
<TE>   "I trained very hard and needed to be able to do a triple loop-triple
loop [to get high technical marks]. It was worth it, and I'm glad I did
it."</TE>
<TE>   More than 15 months after her surgery, Lipinski is touring with Stars
on Ice but still can't do all the triple jumps she used to reel off with
such youthful abandon and apparent ease. When she carried the Olympic
torch in downtown Houston a few weeks ago, she walked her three-block leg
instead of jogging or running, although she was so thrilled she probably
didn't feel her feet touch the ground at all.</TE>
<TE>   "That was pretty cool," she said, "especially in my hometown. I'm
patriotic and I loved doing it."</TE>
<TE>   Her patriotism had been heightened by a visit to the site of the World
Trade Center, a tragedy that hit her hard because she spent last summer
living in Manhattan and thoroughly enjoyed the city's rhythm. In tribute
to the Sept. 11 victims and their families, she performs a routine in the
show to selections of patriotic music.</TE>
<TE>   "My mom, when she was my age, used to work near there," Lipinski said
of the devastated area, "and my grandfather was a fireman. It really made
me realize how fragile everybody and everything is. It's kind of
emotional, and on behalf of everybody, I'm trying to say we should have
faith."</TE>
<TE>   In her new world of shows, pro-am competitions and made-for-TV events
that stress entertaining audiences instead of impressing judges, Lipinski
can draw on emotion and finesse and be a winning performer without
performing six or seven triple jumps in her routines. Unlike
Olympic-eligible skating, in which Kwan, Sarah Hughes, Sasha Cohen and
Angela Nikodinov push each other to ever higher levels of technical
difficulty, Lipinski can get by for now on charm, sass and the few triple
jumps that don't hurt her hip, the triple toe loop and triple salchow.</TE>
<TE>   She has also been honing her artistry with choreographer Lori Nichol,
who designed some of Kwan's most memorable programs and still works with
U.S. men's champion Tim Goebel and world pairs champions Jamie Sale and
David Pelletier.</TE>
<TE>   "This is the first year I ever got to work with someone," she said.
"Usually, I got a program and that was it. She's really helped me get an
edge."</TE>
<TE>   No one will complain if she doesn't do a triple loop because her hip
is too sore. For that matter, if her hip hurts too much to skate, she can
take a day off.</TE>
<TE>   She couldn't have done that if she had pursued a second consecutive
gold medal and continued competing in Olympic-directed events such as the
U.S. and World Championships. She was young enough to contemplate that
possibility after Nagano, where she was the youngest Olympic champion
ever at 15 years 8 months old. But ending a brilliant career in which she
began the sport and reached its apex in a mere three years, she chose to
give up her Olympic eligibility.</TE>
<TE>   She has never looked back, satisfied knowing her performance at the
Olympics was her best, a moment she might never have topped.</TE>
<TE>   "I have not one ounce of regret," said Lipinski, who shares marquee
billing in Stars on Ice with 1984 and 1988 gold medalist Katarina Witt,
1992 Olympic gold medalist Kristi Yamaguchi, 1998 men's gold medalist
Ilia Kulik and four-time world champion Kurt Browning. The 61-city tour,
which began late last month, will reach the Arrowhead Pond Jan. 19 and
Staples Center Jan. 20.</TE>
<TE>   "The main reason I'm happy with my decision is because of my parents,"
she added, referring to the separation her family endured while she
trained near Detroit and lived with her mother, leaving her father in
Houston. "They're together, and I've never seen them so happy. I couldn't
see living apart from Dad for another four years. And I can just go out
now and have fun.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm kind of used to touring and performing now. When I started, I was
thinking, 'I know what this is all about.' But it's so different from
what I had been doing. Before, I was doing a program and there were
judges and competition. Now, it's more for fun."</TE>
<TE>   Facing physical limitations is no fun, at 19 or any other age.
Lipinski defied her doctors' orders to take her rehabilitation slowly and
skated a week after her surgery, but she has since learned to listen to
her body, if not to her medical team.</TE>
<TE>   "It's something I have to deal with every day," she said. "It's
actually so much better now than it was."</TE>
<TE>   While she learns to make the best of her situation, she's also
expanding her horizons and exploring new interests.</TE>
<TE>   She has stepped up her acting career and spent last summer in Paris
costarring as a college student in a still-unreleased independent film
called "The Metro Chase." As far as movies go, she has an edge over 1960
Olympic gold medalist Carol Heiss, whose career consisted of one film
with the Three Stooges, but she remains well short of the film legacy of
three-time Olympic gold medalist Sonja Henie, who starred in many hugely
popular cinematic skating extravaganzas.</TE>
<TE>   "I had so much fun," said Lipinski, who previously had a recurring
role on the daytime drama "The Young and the Restless," besides appearing
in "Touched by an Angel" and "Will and Grace." However, her cameo
appearance with Cameron Diaz in a party scene in the current release
"Vanilla Sky" ended up on the cutting room floor.</TE>
<TE>   "I've been acting for four years and I'm taking more challenging
things," she added. "I'm taking acting lessons. I have a coach and I work
with her all the time. Another reason I turned pro is so I can do things
like this and pursue other dreams. There are lots of new things I'd like
to try."</TE>
<TE>   All those interests and the Stars on Ice tour make it difficult for
her to pay close attention to what's going on in the so-called amateur
ranks.</TE>
<TE>   She will probably be traveling, skating or preparing to skate while
most of this week's U.S. Championships are taking place, but she doesn't
feel she's missing something vitally important. For her, it's part of her
old life.</TE>
<TE>   "I know most of the people, so it's not like there's anyone new who
has come along," she said. "But it's not like I sit home and watch the
Grand Prix final."</TE>
<TE>   She politely declined to predict who will win the U.S. Championships
or the Olympics, and she's not sure she will be in Salt Lake City next
month to watch the coronation of the her successor as the Olympic
champion.</TE>
<TE>   She might attend the Games on behalf of one of her sponsors, although
the Stars on Ice schedule is tight and might not allow for that.</TE>
<TE>   "That would be pretty cool," she said, repeating a favorite phrase. "I
have great memories. You don't just pass on the title--it's more like
you're joining a club, and I can now say I'm in this special club that
not a lot of people are in."</TE>

<TE>   Torrance</TE>
<TE>   * A five-time U.S. champion and four-time world champion, Kwan has had
a turbulent season. She switched choreographers, dropped longtime coach
Frank Carroll and hasn't dominated as she had. Still the skater to beat,
with artistry and musical interpretation that classify her as one of the
sport's greats.</TE>
<TE>   SARAH HUGHES</TE>
<TE>   Great Neck, N.Y.</TE>
<TE>   * Rising star who has all the goods--jumps, artistry and personality.
Won her first Grand Prix event this season, Skate Canada, and finished
third at the Grand Prix Final. Was second at last year's national
competition and third at the World Championships.</TE>
<TE>   ANGELA NIKODINOV</TE>
<TE>   San Pedro</TE>
<TE>   * Third at last year's U.S. nationals and fifth at the World
Championships, her best season. Suffered emotional loss with the death in
November of her coach, Elena Tcherkasskaia, who had become almost a
mother to her. Nikodinov faded in the long program of her three Grand
Prix events this season and missed the Grand Prix Final. Now coached by
Frank Carroll in El Segundo.</TE>
<TE>   SASHA COHEN</TE>
<TE>   Laguna Niguel</TE>
<TE>   * Rebounded from a back injury that kept her out of last year's U.S.
and world competitions. Won her first medal at a Grand Prix competition
by finishing third at the Trophee Lalique in Paris in November. Graceful
skater who has tried to be the first woman to land a quadruple salchow,
but probably won't try it this week unless she needs a dramatic boost.</TE>

<HD>In Long Run, Little Things Remain</HD>
<DH>History: Competitors fondly recall fine details from events in L.A.
in 1954 and in Long Beach in 1972.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HELENE ELLIOTT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It's the little things they remember so vividly, perhaps because
those little things meant so much when they were young and their worlds
revolved around one dream.</LD>
<LD>   For Carol Heiss, the enduring memory of the 1954 U.S. Figure Skating
Championships--the last to be held in Los Angeles until this week's
competition at Staples Center--is defying her doctors and competing
despite a slashed Achilles' tendon. The injury had kept her out of the
world championships, which in that era preceded the U.S. competition, and
she feared judges would forget her if she were absent from the world
championships again.</LD>
<LD>   With a 14-year-old's single-mindedness, she vowed to compete even if
she had to crawl around the Polar Palace.</LD>
<TE>   "I worked real hard on my school figures so I could be a good, solid
second. I could barely free skate my program," said Heiss, who finished
second to Tenley Albright and made the 1955 world team, launching a
career that included four U.S. titles, an Olympic silver medal in 1956
and the gold medal at Squaw Valley in 1960.</TE>
<TE>   A generation later, in 1972, the U.S. championships were held at the
Long Beach Arena. That's the last time they were in the Los Angeles area
before this year's competition. And like the drama that will unfold this
week, the 1972 championships determined who would represent the U.S. at
the Winter Olympics.</TE>
<TE>   For Ken Shelley of Downey, who won the men's title and shared the
pairs title with JoJo Starbuck, skating in Long Beach brought extra
duress.</TE>
<TE>   "When you normally go away for a competition, you're used to that. But
I was staying at home, and there was the pressure of it being an Olympic
year," he said. "And it probably was going to be our final competitive
year. It had a whole different feel to it."</TE>
<TE>   Here are recollections of some of the 1954 and 1972 competitors:</TE>
<TE>1954</TE>
<TE>Winning the junior ladies' title was a major breakthrough for Catherine
Machado of West Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Because she won and the third-place finisher in the senior women's
division turned pro, Machado was sent to the 1955 world championships and
became the first skater from Southern California to compete at that
level. Eugene Turner had qualified in 1940 and 1941, but those
competitions were canceled because of World War II.</TE>
<TE>   "There was a lot of pressure, being a hometown girl in my own rink
.... It was a very big event for the Polar Palace. It was filled to the
gills," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Skating magazine, then the official publication of the U.S. and
Canadian Figure Skating Associations, raved about her. "Wearing a
persimmon velvet dress with long fitted sleeves and a sweetheart neckline
trimmed in sequins, Miss Machado performed an exhibition of free skating
as dazzling as her costume and had the capacity crowd completely
captivated with her poise and her interpretation of her music," Sevy Von
Sonn wrote.</TE>
<TE>   Machado can't recall her routine, but she remembers receiving the
Oscar L. Richard Trophy for the most artistic performance. "I was more
proud of winning that than winning the championship," said Machado, who
in 1956 became the first Latina athlete to compete for the U.S. Olympic
team in the Winter Games. Machado, 65 and widowed, teaches skating at
Culver City. She keeps in touch with many of her contemporaries and hopes
to see them this week; those who have died remain in her heart. "Tim
[Brown, the 1954 men's junior champion] is gone. Ronnie [Robertson] is
gone," she said. "Unfortunately, I see a lot of people I competed against
in juniors at funerals."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Franklin Nelson of Tulsa, Okla., won't forget the Polar Palace.</TE>
<TE>   "That was the rink that had the hump on one side," said Nelson, who
shared the silver dance title with Sidney Foster. "It wasn't so bad for
ice dancing or free skating, but if you were doing [compulsory] figures,
you had to place them such that you got the downhill side to give you a
little boost."</TE>
<TE>   Nelson and Foster's free dance, according to Skating magazine,
displayed "beautiful form and seemingly perfect unison." He remembers it
for what they couldn't do, not what they did.</TE>
<TE>   "There were no lifts allowed and you pretty much had to be in contact
at all times. There was no original dance," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Nelson joined the Navy in 1956, when he and Foster wound down their
competitive career. He went to medical school and became a surgeon, but
remained involved in skating, including serving as president of the
USFSA.</TE>
<TE>   "I haven't been to L.A. in some time other than passing through the
airport," said Nelson, 68 and living in Bainbridge Island, Wash. "These
nationals are going to be exciting."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The 1954 U.S. championships were a test of nerves for Robin Greiner.</TE>
<TE>   He and Carole Ormaca of Fresno had won the pairs title the previous
year, and they were tense about defending it before so many of their
friends and relatives. But another memory stands above all.</TE>
<TE>   "Remember the actor Tab Hunter?" Greiner said. "He was there, and he
brought Debbie Reynolds to the event as his date. She was my favorite
actress. They were sitting in the second row, and it was all I could do
to keep my focus every time I saw her."</TE>
<TE>   Greiner didn't meet Reynolds, but he and Ormaca repeated as champions.
They finished fourth at the 1955 world championships, the second of three
times they finished just out of a medal.</TE>
<TE>   "We skated three to five competitions a year, and skaters do that now
in a month," said Greiner, who is nearly 70 and retired after managing
two funeral homes. "I'm surely glad I skated then instead of now."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   For years, David Jenkins skated in the shadow of his older brother,
Hayes, who won the U.S. and world championships four times each and won
gold at the 1956 Winter Games in Cortina, Italy.</TE>
<TE>   David would win four U.S. titles, three world titles, an Olympic
silver medal in 1956 and gold in 1960. But in 1954, he was still Hayes'
little brother. Skating magazine reported that David Jenkins performed
with vigor and daring.</TE>
<TE>   Jenkins laughed at that account. "They didn't say I skated half like a
hockey player, which I still was," he said. "What I remember most is it
was my first time in seniors and the first time I competed against my
brother."</TE>
<TE>   The brothers were born and reared in Akron, Ohio. When their parents
couldn't pay for their skating, they got help from the Broadmoor Hotel in
Colorado Springs and a foundation, which was controversial in the days
skaters were supposed to be amateurs.</TE>
<TE>   Jenkins, 65, retired after practicing medicine for 30 years and lives
in Tulsa. He said he did triple jumps in his 40s but hasn't skated for
five or six years. However, he still follows the sport closely--and not
only because Heiss married his brother and became a coach. He's looking
forward to watching this week's competition on TV but wonders if the men
are inviting injury by focusing so much on quadruple jumps.</TE>
<TE>   "I could go through my competitive program in practice and feel
confident I could do it in competition. Now they're pushing their
programs so far," he said.</TE>
<TE>1972</TE>
<TE>To see Janet Lynn perform is to know why steel was cut into blades and
attached to skating boots.</TE>
<TE>   At Long Beach, the mesmerizing blond with the pixie haircut won the
fourth of five consecutive U.S. titles, blending proficiency with the
blissful artistry that characterized all of her performances.</TE>
<TE>   "She just took my breath away," said Josephine Lawless, historian for
the Los Angeles Figure Skating Club--the host club for the national
competition--and an official at countless local figure skating events
since 1956. "She was close in style, I think, to Michelle Kwan."</TE>
<TE>   Even Lynn's rivals were in awe of her and knew they were competing for
second.</TE>
<TE>   "It was foregone unless she really messed up," said Suna Murray, then
15 and visiting California for the first time. "She was kind of my idol.
The first time I made the world team [1971] I remember Janet sent her
skates to the Skating Club of New York [Murray's club] to be sharpened,
and I remember touching her boots for good luck."</TE>
<TE>   Murray recalls Long Beach fondly. "I don't think the arena had any
barriers, and I felt like I could soar forever," said Murray, who was
third behind Lynn and Holmes and won a berth at the Sapporo Olympics,
where she finished 12th.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Many of the 1972 champions will be honored in a ceremony Tuesday at
Staples Center, but Lynn isn't likely to be among them.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm trying to talk her into it," said Julie Holmes, now Julie Holmes
Newman, mother of two skaters and two hockey players and a skating coach
in La Jolla and Escondido. "She puts God first, then her family, and she
felt it wasn't the right time to come. Two of her [five] children are in
the Navy."</TE>
<TE>   Holmes finished ahead of Lynn at the 1970 and 1971 world championships
because she was adept at compulsory figures and Lynn had trouble with
those intricate tracings. However, at Long Beach, Holmes was first in the
figures but was passed by Lynn in the free skating. Both qualified for
the Olympics, where Lynn finished third and Holmes was fourth.</TE>
<TE>   Lynn could not be contacted.</TE>
<TE>   "Things have changed with multi-million dollar contracts," Holmes
Newman said, "but we just did it for the love of the sport."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Judy Sladky recalls the short boards at the Long Beach Arena, the
Queen Mary berthed nearby and the nostalgia of knowing it would be her
last U.S. competition with ice dance partner Jim Sladky.</TE>
<TE>   They won their fifth consecutive U.S. championship, but it was the end
of their competitive road because ice dancing hadn't yet become an
Olympic sport. "It was time to start making money," Jim Sladky said.</TE>
<TE>   He remembers they won praise for their free dance, which included part
of "Irma La Douce" and "a guitar thing" before changing to a waltz.</TE>
<TE>   "We were not big, tall and elegant and we didn't go at 100 mph, with
our sleeves fluttering gracefully in the breeze," he said. "We were short
and quick and we had quick footwork."</TE>
<TE>   They performed in ice shows for many years and lived for a while in
the San Fernando Valley. They were together 27 years and married for 19
before divorcing.</TE>
<TE>   He's a hotel engineer in Hartford, Conn., but skates nearly every day
in nearby Cromwell.</TE>
<TE>   Judy Sladky works for Sesame Street and Charles Schulz productions.
She's the voice of Baby Alice Snuffleupagus and skates in a Snoopy
costume in ice shows, doing back flips on the trampoline. "The old broad
can still skate," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Said Jim Sladky: "She's amazing. That's one of the reasons we did as
well as we did. I was just a prop, a guy showing off a beautiful woman.
It was always well-noted that Judy was doing all the hard work."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Shelley was busy at the 1972 nationals, winning the men's title,
sharing the pairs title and juggling his studies at Cal State Long Beach.
"I was either training, eating or sleeping," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Emotive and athletic, Starbuck and Shelley were immensely popular with
fans and judges. Skating magazine praised their innovative stag overhead
lift and double cartwheel with a throw landing, but Shelley insisted
neither was difficult.</TE>
<TE>   "That's what you would call a star lift now," said Shelley, who was
first paired with Starbuck at a studio rink in Downey when they were 7.
"Things have changed a lot. When I competed, I did one triple jump the
year I won nationals. I was working on another but it wasn't consistent,
so I said, 'Let's not mar the program by taking a chance.' There's a
whole different outlook now. They go for broke."</TE>
<TE>   Shelley lives in New York City and is active in the USFSA. He will run
a seminar for novice skaters and their parents this week in Los Angeles.
Starbuck had planned to attend this week but canceled because her mother
is ill.</TE>
<TE>   Starbuck and Shelley remain friends, but they don't skate together
anymore.</TE>
<TE>   "The last time we skated was about four years ago," he said. "It was,
'Let's see those old folks skate once more.' We didn't embarrass
ourselves too much, but we looked at each other and said, 'I don't think
we'll do this again."'</TE>

<HD>Kahle and Wong Leading After the Short Program</HD>

<LD>Danielle Kahle has made a habit of scaling a hill near her home in
Thousand Oaks nearly every day for conditioning purposes.</LD>
<LD>   "It's a mile up and a mile down," Kahle said.</LD>
<LD>   For exercise Sunday, the 12-year-old climbed to the top of the heap
after the short program in the novice women's competition in the 2002
State Farm U.S. Figure Skating Championships at the Sports Arena.</LD>
<TE>   Going into today's free skate, Kahle has an edge over second-place
Lisa Dannemiller of Ann Arbor, Mich., and third-place Natalie Mecher of
Waukegan, Ill.</TE>
<TE>   The performance by Kahle, the Southwest Pacific regional and Pacific
Coast sectional novice champion this season, continues a successful year.
"She's really blossomed," said Nadine Graziano, her coach. "She seemed to
be very comfortable out there."</TE>
<TE>   Novice men's leader Jason Wong of Lexington, Mass., also made himself
at home in his first trip to Los Angeles, and he had reason to be upbeat
after taking a circuitous route to the championships. Wong, who placed
ninth at last year's nationals, had to overcome nearly five months of not
skating last year because of a broken left ankle.</TE>
<TE>   The injury, partially related to a recent six-inch growth spurt, meant
the 15-year-old needed a bye into regional competition. An injury to the
same ankle after regionals brought byes into both the sectionals and
nationals.</TE>
<TE>   "It's been a struggle," said Wong, who was the first competitor of the
day and set a high standard with six first-place votes, two seconds and a
third. "But I wanted to skate well, and I wanted to show I deserved all
the byes."</TE>
<TE>   Casey McCraw of Colorado Springs, Colo., is in second place, and
Robert Dierking of Jamestown, N.Y., is third, going into the free skate.
Katie Boxwell and William Sears of New York lead the novice pairs
competition, and Meryl Davis and Charlie White of Detroit are leading the
novice dance competition.</TE>

<HD>Button Has Never Been Known to Zip His Lip</HD>

<LD>It was a Dick Button moment. Irina Slutskaya was skating a sloppy
final long program at the International Skating Union Grand Prix finals.
Her arms were flailing, her landings were imprecise, her movements
choppy.</LD>
<LD>   Button, doing television commentary, blurted out, "That's an ugly
position."</LD>
<LD>   His comment was repeated to him later, incorrectly as, "That's an
ugly, ugly position," Button summoned his considerable authority and
said, "That is wrong. I only said 'ugly' once. And it was an ugly
position."</LD>
<TE>   Button, 72, is back on television and in full voice. A year after
suffering a bad fall while skating in preparation for an exhibition,
Button will be at Staples Center this week, giving his unfiltered,
unfettered, considerably educated opinion for ABC.</TE>
<TE>   Television viewers love Button. Or hate him. There is an Internet site
that promotes a drinking game patterned on one called "Hi, Bob." People
watched old episodes of "The Bob Newhart Show," and took a drink whenever
someone on the show said "Hi, Bob."</TE>
<TE>   The "Hi, Dick," game offers Button fans the chance to chug on cue for
any number of Buttonisms: when he criticizes a skater for being
unmotivated, when he uses the word "nice" or the phrase "first rate."
According to the rules, everybody also drinks if Button says, "\o7 How
\f7 nice!"</TE>
<TE>   Button laughs about the game. He knows that people remember some of
his most famous moments, such as the time he commented--as Angela
Nikodinov skated onto the ice--that when Nikodinov skated, it was "a good
time for a refrigerator break."</TE>
<TE>   His broadcast partner, Terry Gannon, responded by asking Button to
bring him a beverage.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think you get that on any other broadcasts in any sport,"
Gannon says. "Those are one-of-a-kind moments."</TE>
<TE>   Button has no memory of his accident, which happened Dec. 31, 2000.</TE>
<TE>   "Last thing I remember, I was doing a back outside loop, change loop.
I do remember saying to myself, 'I need to do some forward jumps,"' he
says.</TE>
<TE>   While recovering from his head injury, Button suffered an infection.
He prefers not to talk about his rehabilitation other than to say, "It
was a long and complicated process and now I feel wonderful."</TE>
<TE>   Button also says his recovery was "an eye-opening experience, a life
redefining experience. I think more clearly about many things. Every day
is more important. What I went through makes one feel like telling people
you love them now. I've vowed to be kinder, have a more tender heart. But
I will still be critical of skaters."</TE>
<TE>   Slutskaya knows about that.</TE>
<TE>   Gannon, a good college basketball player at North Carolina State,
thinks that if the athletes criticized by Button listen and learn, they
will be better skaters.</TE>
<TE>   Peggy Fleming, another broadcast partner and a pretty fair skater
herself, says she understands how Button does come off sometimes as
mean-spirited.</TE>
<TE>   "But Dick is always trying to criticize in a constructive way," she
says. "If you are smart enough to listen, you will learn. He never tries
to be hurtful. But some people do take criticism better than others."</TE>
<TE>   Most of this generation of figure skating fans know Button only for
his acerbic TV work, but Fleming calls Button "the father of our sport,"
for good reason.</TE>
<TE>   Button was a seven-time national champion, five-time world champion
and a two-time Olympic gold medalist--1948 and 1952. At the 1948 Games in
St. Moritz, Switzerland, he became the first skater to complete a double
axel in competition. In 1952, as a Harvard senior, he became the first
man to complete a triple jump--a triple loop--in competition. Button has
a law degree from Harvard and started his own production company, Candid
Productions, which created the World Professional Figure Skating
Championships.</TE>
<TE>   So when Button once said of Canadian skater Kate Robinson, "Now, isn't
she the quintessential pre-Raphaelite heroine?" he knew how a
pre-Raphaelite heroine would look. And if the rest of us didn't, it would
be a good reason to look up pre-Raphaelite heroines, wouldn't it?</TE>
<TE>   And when Button said during a rather shaky performance by Michelle
Kwan, "Oh, she popped her triple into a single and had trouble on her
axel landing, but, \o7 who cares? \f7 Isn't she just wonderful?" it's
hard not be equally enthusiastic. After all, Dick said so.</TE>
<TE>   Peter Carruthers, a former champion pairs skater with his sister,
Kitty, who now joins Button in the television booth, says that he would
never be quite as blunt as Button but adds, "What would skating be
without Dick Button? At times, yeah, I kind of crack up. You never know
what will come out of his mouth. Then he'll say something and I may have
been thinking the same thing. I'd never have the nerve to say it."</TE>
<TE>   Carruthers says Button is a man of strong, well-informed opinions:</TE>
<TE>   "With Dick, there is no gray area. Dick has his own interpretations
and he is at an age, and with the lifetime of experiences, which just
lets him open the floodgates. Like it or not, right or wrong."</TE>
<TE>   Gannon says he never tries to take the edge off anything Button says.</TE>
<TE>   "I react honestly to what he says. There is, for Dick, no filter
between what he thinks and what he says. In any given meeting we have,
there is a point where Dick erupts into an honestly passionate discourse
about the sport and the people in it. He cares so much about the sport,"
Gannon says.</TE>
<TE>   Carruthers, Fleming and Gannon agree on one thing: Button doesn't like
mediocrity.</TE>
<TE>   Curt Gowdy Jr., producer of ABC's figure skating coverage since 1988,
says that Button has "a love-hate relationship" with the viewers.</TE>
<TE>   "Some find Dick too condescending, too negative," Gowdy says. "But
that's Dick being honest. And let me tell you, honesty is a rare trait,
not often found in broadcasting. And that's what makes Dick truly
different, truly refreshing."</TE>
<TE>   On a recent trip, the ABC crew was in the Detroit airport. Gowdy says
that Doug Wilson, the program director, had met two women. "When they
heard what Doug did, they promptly told Doug that they disliked Dick
because he was too frank and honest," Gowdy says.</TE>
<TE>   "So Doug tells the ladies to wait a minute, he has someone he'd like
them to meet. Then Doug comes and gets Dick and tells him two of his fans
want to meet him. Doug introduces Dick to the ladies and they immediately
tell him, 'Oh, Dick, we just love you.' We all laughed."</TE>
<TE>   As the crew gets ready to assemble for the U.S. Figure Skating
Championships at Staples Center, Fleming says that all the broadcasters
are happy.</TE>
<TE>   "We were worried a bit," she says. "Dick was very sick, very sick last
year. But he did pull through, and what we have now is a nicer and
improved Dick. In reality, he's a big-hearted, sweet man. He still has so
much life and energy and passion for our sport."</TE>
<TE>   Even if you think Button talks too much, is too negative, too
know-it-all, when Button is away, the sport suffers. His voice, deep and
authoritative, elevates figure skating. He is like Charles Barkley,
making it worthwhile to tune into the broadcast just to hear some real
opinions, some honest feedback. Button can make us mad, make us
laugh--but most of all he teaches us something about skating. And
sometimes even something about pre-Raphaelite art.</TE>

<HD>Boy Who Crashed Plane Carried Note of Sympathy for Bin Laden</HD>
<DH>Inquiry: Student pilot described as lonely and depressed.
Authorities say he acted alone.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN-THOR DAHLBURG</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>TAMPA, Fla.
</DL>
<LD>It was a lonely and despondent 15-year-old, feeling sympathy for
accused terrorist mastermind Osama bin Laden, who stole a private plane
and slammed it into a Tampa skyscraper, authorities said Sunday.</LD>
<LD>   A brief handwritten note found in the pocket of student pilot Charles
J. Bishop, who died in the Saturday crash, strongly implied that the high
school freshman was inspired by the terrorist attacks on the World Trade
Center and the Pentagon.</LD>
<LD>   "He made a statement expressing sympathy with Osama bin Laden and the
events of 9/11," Tampa Police Chief Bennie R. Holder said at a news
conference.</LD>
<TE>   Despite the contents of the note, authorities said they were treating
the incident as the suicide of a desperate teen and not as an attack
against a U.S. target.</TE>
<TE>   "He had acted alone, without any help from anyone else," Holder said.
"This was a young man who had very few friends and he was very much a
loner. From this action, we can assume he was a very troubled young man."</TE>
<TE>   No one else was hurt when the single-engine Cessna, which may have
been traveling about 100 mph, punched a 10-foot-wide gap in the side of
the 42-story Bank of America Plaza building only minutes after taking off
from nearby St. Petersburg-Clearwater International Airport.</TE>
<TE>   Unwittingly, the boy may have revealed holes in the aerial safety net
that many Americans believe protects the country's cities. When asked
whether nothing could have been done to prevent Saturday's crash, a
National Transportation Safety Board official said, "That's correct."</TE>
<TE>   "The response was occurring when the aircraft hit the building," said
Butch Wilson, an NTSB investigator. "Things were moving, but in nine to
12 minutes, to get aircraft in the air, it's not enough time."</TE>
<TE>   He added: "You can't protect people from someone who's bound and
determined to do themselves in."</TE>
<TE>   Neighbors in middle-class Palm Harbor, Fla., where Bishop lived with
his mother for at least three months, said the boy often appeared sad and
withdrawn. The new arrival was small for his age and seemed to have been
trying hard but unsuccessfully to fit in.</TE>
<TE>   "When I'd walk my dog, and he'd walk by, I always had the sense that
he was depressed," said Linda Wolf, an airline sales employee whose son
rode the same school bus as Bishop. "His carriage was one of somebody who
just wasn't very happy."</TE>
<TE>   Lindsey Knott, 18, a classmate of Bishop at East Lake High School,
described him as friendly but said he was usually alone. "He was kind of
quiet most of the time, but you'd hear him telling about where he had
moved from, or how he was new here."</TE>
<TE>   Some neighbors said he came to Florida from Boston.</TE>
<TE>   Other students who rode the bus with Bishop said he never spoke during
the journeys to and from school, and mostly stared out the window. "He
stayed mostly to himself, as far as I could tell," said Dan Harrison, 15.
Bishop frequently walked the neighborhood streets, joined by his terrier
and always wearing shorts, he said.</TE>
<TE>   On Sunday, FBI agents and forensic investigators of the Pinellas
County Sheriff's Department searched through the gray-and-white two-story
townhouse where Bishop lived, looking for clues about his mood and
motivations. Holder said the boy's computer also would be searched.</TE>
<TE>   The police chief declined to provide further information from the note
written by the boy, saying the investigation was continuing.</TE>
<TE>Teenager Took Off Without Instructor</TE>
<TE>   Bishop, a flight student, showed up for a 5 p.m. EST lesson Saturday
at the St. Petersburg-Clearwater Airport and was instructed to conduct a
preflight check of the plane, police said. He took off without waiting
for an instructor who was supposed to accompany him.</TE>
<TE>   A Coast Guard helicopter chased down the plane, but Bishop ignored the
copter pilot's signals to land.</TE>
<TE>   During his short flight, the teenager breached the restricted airspace
of MacDill Air Force Base south of Tampa, where U.S. Central Command is
directing the actions of American troops in Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   The base was alerted by radio that a minor flying a private plane was
coming in its direction, but "we didn't feel that there was any threat to
MacDill at the time," said Lt. Col. Rich McClain, a base spokesman.</TE>
<TE>   Two F-15 fighter jets scrambled from Homestead Air Base, 200 miles
south of Tampa, near Miami, to try to intercept Bishop, but by the time
they arrived, the Cessna had plowed into the 28th floor of the Bank of
America tower, a prominent feature of this city's skyline.</TE>
<TE>   Officials said there was little doubt that Bishop had been in control
of the plane at all times. "I have radar data that shows him flying
directly into the building," Wilson said.</TE>
<TE>   Bishop had been taking lessons since March at the airport, on the
western side of Tampa Bay. He was not a frequent student and would wash
the airplanes belonging to the school, National Aviation Holding Inc., to
get a break on the fees.</TE>
<TE>   Investigators said Sunday that it did not appear that any regulations
were violated in leaving Bishop alone with the plane and its keys.</TE>
<TE>   Most flight schools lock down their airplanes, keep tight control of
the keys and insist that novices be accompanied at all times on the
tarmac. But several flight instructors Sunday acknowledged that the Tampa
incident could be repeated just about anywhere.</TE>
<TE>   "Anyone who's clever enough can steal anything they want," said Joe
Justice, owner of Justice Aviation in Santa Monica, a flight school that
manages about 30 aircraft.</TE>
<TE>   Yes, there is security, he said, but there's security in parking
garages too. "What security can be put in place so that a 15-year-old
can't steal a car?" Justice asked. "Anyone who can break into a car can
break into an airplane."</TE>
<TE>Leaving a Novice Called Unwise</TE>
<TE>   Justice said he would never leave a student pilot alone with the
plane, because even if he didn't take off, he could get hurt by spinning
propellers or could accidentally damage the aircraft.</TE>
<TE>   But several other flight instructors said such chaperoning isn't an
industry standard and that it is routine to have students conduct
preflight checks alone.</TE>
<TE>   "What the flight instructor did was what normally happens," said
Warren Morningstar, vice president of communications for the Aircraft
Owners and Pilots Assn. "There really was not a security breach. There
was an abuse of trust here."</TE>
<TE>   For some Tampa residents, Saturday's incident--and the scream of
police and fire rescue sirens in the streets that followed--triggered
fears that terrorism had struck their city too. Mary Geraci, a camera
operator for a local television station, was playing Scrabble with
friends about a quarter-mile from the Bank of America building at the
time.</TE>
<TE>   "I just said, 'Oh my God, they're here. It's happening in my own
backyard,' " she said.</TE>
<TE>   Early Sunday, wreckage from the Cessna's fuselage, which had been
jutting from the skyscraper almost 300 feet above ground, was carefully
lowered to the street. The remnants of the plane were taken to Peter O.
Knight Airport near Tampa, Fla., where they will be reassembled as part
of the NTSB's investigation.</TE>

<HD>Drawn-Out Tahoe Case May Be a Watershed on Land Use</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID G. SAVAGE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>For several hundred families, the 1970s dream of retiring at Lake
Tahoe has led instead to more than 20 years of litigation, frustration
and taxes.</LD>
<LD>   Dorothy Cook, a widowed bookkeeper who was living in the San Fernando
Valley, purchased a small lot overlooking the lake in 1977. Kenneth and
Betty Eberle bought two adjoining wooded lots about the same time.</LD>
<LD>   But when it came time to build, they were blocked by a 1981 moratorium
on development, a supposedly temporary delay that has stretched out for
years.</LD>
<TE>   Environmentalists said runoff from rain and melting snow would drain
through certain lots if developed and pollute the crystal-clear water of
the mountain lake. So the owners' building permits were denied, even as
they watched houses going up on some of the lots around them.</TE>
<TE>   "We haven't been able to do anything with it, except pay taxes,"
Kenneth Eberle of Cambria, Calif., said of his Tahoe lot.</TE>
<TE>   The Eberles and Cook are part of a 1984 lawsuit brought by nearly 700
families who had been prohibited from building on their Tahoe lots. They
sought compensation from the California-Nevada planning agency that
imposed the moratorium.</TE>
<TE>   Today, the Supreme Court will take up the Tahoe case to decide a
question of property law that is being closely watched by builders,
environmentalists and land-use planners across the nation.</TE>
<TE>   The outcome will determine when, if ever, the government must pay for
delays in allowing property owners to use their land.</TE>
<TE>   The case turns on the meaning of the 5th Amendment to the
Constitution, which says "private property [shall not] be taken for
public use, without just compensation."</TE>
<TE>   At one time, an unconstitutional "taking" of private property was
limited to instances where the government took over land for its use.
More recently, the high court has made clear that a government regulation
that bars all beneficial use of private property can also trigger a
demand for compensation.</TE>
<TE>   It has remained unclear, however, whether a temporary freeze or a
moratorium on development entitles the landowners to compensation.</TE>
<TE>   Over 17 years, the Tahoe case has bounced back and forth in the
federal courts, prompting a classic liberal-conservative split among
judges on the West Coast--with conservatives siding with property owners
and liberals arguing that government has the right to limit certain uses
of property.</TE>
<TE>   In the most recent rounds, the litigation has focused on whether
property owners deserve money for a "temporary taking" of their land.</TE>
<TE>   A trial judge in Reno ruled that the Tahoe families were entitled to
compensation because the moratorium deprived them of all use of their
land for at least three years. Strangely enough, the lawsuit has
proceeded as a dispute over how things stood in 1984--three years after
the moratorium was imposed--and has essentially ignored the fact that the
owners still are unable to build on their land.</TE>
<TE>   In an appeal, lawyers for the regional planning agency argued that the
building moratorium was justified by the need to protect the lake. The
U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals agreed two years ago, reversing the
decision of the trial judge.</TE>
<TE>   A moratorium, by its nature, is a temporary measure, said Judge
Stephen Reinhardt of Los Angeles. It "did not deprive the plaintiffs of
all 'use' of their property," he reasoned, because its usefulness "runs
from the present to the future." Someday, the lot owners may win a permit
to build on their land. And they are free to sell it to others, including
to the U.S. Forest Service, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "In reaching this conclusion, we preserve the ability of local
governments to do what they have done for years--to engage in orderly,
reasonable land-use planning through a considered and deliberative
process. To do otherwise would turn the Takings Clause into a weapon to
be used indiscriminately to penalize local communities for attempting to
protect the public interest," wrote Reinhardt, a liberal leader of the
9th Circuit.</TE>
<TE>   In dissent, Judge Alex Kozinski of Pasadena joined four of his
conservative colleagues in all but urging the Supreme Court to reverse
Reinhardt's opinion.</TE>
<TE>   "Let's say the government decides to use your house as a warehouse for
three years. You are locked out and the government has the run of the
property for that period," Kozinski wrote. "Is there any doubt that you
have suffered a taking for which you should be compensated? Of course
not. Why should the case be any different if the government simply
prohibits you from using your house for three years, but never gets
around to using it as a warehouse?"</TE>
<TE>   The Supreme Court voted in June to hear the property owners' appeal in
the case (Tahoe Sierra Preservation Council vs. Tahoe Regional Planning
Agency, 00-1167). Under Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist, the high
court has moved repeatedly to strengthen the rights of property owners.</TE>
<TE>   Santa Monica attorney Michael M. Berger, who is representing the Tahoe
lot owners, argues that property owners are entitled to compensation
whenever the government forbids them from using their land, even
temporarily.</TE>
<TE>   "If it's a flat-out prohibition of using your land, whether's it's for
a day or a decade, it's taking," Berger said. Compensation "may not be
worth much if it's just for a short time, but it's still a taking."</TE>
<TE>   In his brief to the Supreme Court, Berger says the Tahoe lot owners
have been left with nothing but a "barren title." They have paid
assessments for putting in waterlines, sewage facilities and roads around
the lake, and they pay property taxes. Yet the planning board continues
to bar them from building.</TE>
<TE>   Under the regional land-use plan, lots around the Tahoe Basin were
rated on a point system according to their likelihood of causing erosion.
Runoff from developed properties has increased nitrogen levels in the
lake, triggering algae growth. Owners with land judged to be a "low
hazard" obtained permits, while owners with "high hazard" lots were
denied.</TE>
<TE>   Environmentalists fear that a ruling in favor of the Tahoe lot owners
would tie the hands of land-use planners. Even temporary measures to
protect the environment could result in huge liability judgments against
the government, they said.</TE>
<TE>   Timothy Dowling, a lawyer with the pro-environment group Community
Rights Counsel, said Berger is "taking an extreme position. No court has
ever recognized an absolute constitutional right to build immediately."
Dowling filed a friend-of-the-court brief on behalf of the National
League of Cities, the National Conference of State Legislatures and other
government groups.</TE>
<TE>   In a move that might surprise conservatives, the Bush administration's
Solicitor Gen. Theodore B. Olson joined the case on the side of the Tahoe
planning board. He defended Reinhardt's opinion, telling the justices
that "temporary development [moratoriums] represent an important land-use
planning tool with a well-established tradition."</TE>
<TE>   Today, Olson will be in the courtroom to help argue the case for the
planning agency.</TE>
<TE>   The families who have been fighting the lawsuit say they are taken
aback to hear it described as a dispute over a "temporary" ban on
development. Their years of enjoying retirement are ebbing.</TE>
<TE>   "We're 84 years old," Hall McElree of San Francisco said of himself
and Georgetta, his wife. "We bought a lot in the early '70s. We wanted a
place to retire, a place to ski, maybe a place for our kids. It's lovely
up there, but we're not going to ski these days.</TE>
<TE>   "I think we are prejudiced about this situation," McElree said mildly.
"We can't understand why there is a house on both sides of us, but we
can't do anything with our lot," McElree said.</TE>
<TE>   When the lawsuit began, there were 700 families as plaintiffs. Now,
449 are left in the case, the others having died, sold their lots or
given up.</TE>
<TE>   Donald Turner of San Diego said he visited Tahoe as a young Navy man
and found just the right place to build an A-frame home.</TE>
<TE>   "I had designed it, had planned and was shocked when I learned we
couldn't build," he said. "Gosh, it's been a long time, but it's a
terrible thing to have a piece of land and not be able to do anything
with it. This has destroyed a dream for a lot of people."</TE>

<DH>S. America: Argentine leader devalues the peso and ends the
currency's one-to-one peg with the U.S. dollar in effort to halt fiscal
collapse. Wage cuts, inflation are likely.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRIS KRAUL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>BUENOS AIRES
</DL>
<LD>Ending agonizing days of uncertainty, Argentina finally embarked on
a new economic path Sunday night, ending its 10-year experiment with a
dollar-based currency by declaring an immediate devaluation of nearly
30%.</LD>
<LD>   As expected, the nation is also stopping payment on $135 billion in
public debt, the biggest default ever by a country.</LD>
<LD>   The government of new President Eduardo Duhalde finally acted Sunday
night after the Argentine Congress granted him sweeping powers to reshape
the economy and at the same time nullify the Argentine peso's one-to-one
peg to the U.S. dollar. That was the economy's blessing, then its bane.</LD>
<TE>   The introduction of a dollar-pegged peso in 1991 ended Argentina's
nightmarish cycles of hyper-inflation because it immediately restricted
the nation's ability to print money to the number of dollars it had in
reserve. But that became a handicap after Brazil, the country's chief
trading partner--and economic rival--devalued its currency in 1999,
making Argentina's products less competitive at one fell swoop.</TE>
<TE>   The emergency plan follows a month of civil disturbances that left 27
people dead and forced the resignation of two presidents.</TE>
<TE>   After a weekend free of the demonstrations and violence that had
caused the crisis in Latin America's third-largest economy to deepen, the
nation today awaits the popular verdict on the new economic measures. In
the short term, they seem sure to cause pain, including inflation and
wage cuts, especially among government workers whose salaries have
already been reduced.</TE>
<TE>   It also remains to be seen whether the government can successfully
maintain the new exchange rate of 1.40 pesos to the dollar. History has
shown that a devalued currency finds its own equilibrium and that
government attempts to support a certain level of value usually fail.</TE>
<TE>   The plan calls for all dollar-denominated loans and contracts of up to
$100,000 to be converted to pesos--a measure that could prompt a banking
crisis. Facing billions of dollars in loan losses, Spanish banks that
have established themselves here in recent years were said to be
threatening to shut their doors and leave the country.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. investors who bought privatized government banks, utilities and
energy companies here in the 1990s are also being exposed to huge
potential losses because the terms of such contracts, on services ranging
from electricity to telephones, are also being converted to pesos.</TE>
<TE>   Sempra Energy of San Diego owns a huge stake in a gas distribution
system in central Argentina and will see its revenue drop significantly
in dollar terms.</TE>
<TE>   In a televised briefing for reporters, new Economy Minister Jorge
Remes Lenicov acknowledged that the plan will create winners and losers
but said the government was forced to take drastic action because the
economy had been flattened by crushing external debt, a "growing
depression" and a failed monetary policy.</TE>
<TE>   "The economy, like Argentina, is in collapse," said Lenicov, who
became economy minister Thursday, the day after Duhalde became
Argentina's fifth president in two weeks. "This is a new direction. It
would have been a miracle had we continued with the policies of the past
and seen different results."</TE>
<TE>   The plan's immediate goal is to reactivate economic activity and
regain the confidence of Argentine savings depositors, who withdrew $21
billion from the banking system last year, depleting the nation's
reserves. Lenicov reiterated Duhalde's promise of last week that those
with dollar deposits will, over time, be able to get their money, but he
did not specify when.</TE>
<TE>   Lenicov said Argentina will try to begin talks with the International
Monetary Fund in coming weeks after putting its new monetary and budget
plans on the table. He told reporters that the country might ask for $15
billion to $20 billion in aid.</TE>
<TE>   Despite an $11-billion budget deficit last year and tax revenue that
dropped 33% in December, Lenicov said the new government budget coming
this week will attempt to achieve "equilibrium."</TE>
<TE>   Argentina will impose an "austerity" program, he said, but he declined
to estimate how much spending will be cut. The plan includes a 90-day ban
on firings but no price freezes. The government will also tax foreign oil
sales for a fund that will compensate companies hurt by the devaluation.</TE>
<TE>   Pesos will trade starting Wednesday--today and Tuesday have been
designated bank holidays--at 1.40 to the dollar, a 28% devaluation,
Lenicov said. The new rate will apply to commerce in goods and services
and capital flows. The exchange rate for tourists will be allowed to
float freely.</TE>
<TE>   In a few months, Lenicov said, the government will let the currency
float freely on currency markets. Prices will not be fixed, although some
services will be regulated, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Lenicov added that the country has no intention of becoming
protectionist or closing its doors.</TE>
<TE>   "We will be doing nothing strange. We want to do what other countries
have done to become productive," he said.</TE>
<TE>   During January and February, the government will print an unspecified
amount of new pesos, a risky move that could ignite inflation if
overdone, said Gary Hufbauer of the Institute of International Economics.</TE>
<TE>   The Congress was moved to act after a worsening economy and civil
unrest provoked by a restriction on savings withdrawals forced the
resignation of Fernando de la Rua on Dec. 20 and then of his interim
replacement, Adolfo Rodriguez Saa, on Dec. 30. Two other men also served
briefly as caretaker president.</TE>
<TE>   "Given the circumstances Duhalde was in, this was about the best he
could do," Hufbauer said.</TE>
<TE>   Banks will be especially hurt by the conversion of obligations indexed
to the dollar to debts payable in pesos, making portfolios of car,
consumer and home loans suddenly less revenue-producing. Spanish energy
giant Repsol, which paid $18 billion for the Argentine oil company YPF in
the 1990s, and telecommunications giant Telefonica, which owns land line
and cellular phone interests here, are also staring at big losses.</TE>
<TE>   Lenicov acknowledged that there had been intense lobbying efforts by
Spanish government officials and business leaders to change the terms of
the conversion of contracts, but he said he refused to take their
telephone calls until after the new economic package is put in place.
Duhalde and other Cabinet members reportedly will meet with foreign firms
this week.</TE>

because of animal rights activism and the increasing appeal of pooches as
pets.</DH>

<DL>SEOUL
</DL>
<LD>Prancing on a chair in a fashionable cafe, an 11-month-old beagle
wears a red patent-leather collar and a sweater in festive Christmas
colors. Nobody seems bothered when she puts her paws on the cafe table or
tries to lap at her owner's cappuccino. In fact, this cafe is designed
especially for dog owners--the menu even includes dog food--and many of
the clients say they wouldn't consider going out on weekends to any
establishment that didn't welcome their pets.</LD>
<LD>   "My dog comes first," says Kim Ju Young, a 29-year-old marketing
manager who, with her beagle, Blue, patronizes several new cafes in Seoul
that cater to dogs.</LD>
<LD>   Across town there is another eating establishment where the clientele
speaks highly of dog. Dog meat, that is, the specialty of the house.</LD>
<TE>   "Dog meat gives a man strength and vigor," declares 86-year-old Park
In Bok, a retired businessman, polishing off a bowl of spicy crimson soup
made of stewed canine, red pepper and sesame leaves.</TE>
<TE>   There are two kinds of dogs in South Korea, those that are coddled,
coiffed and often treated with more indulgence than children--and those
that are raised as a culinary delicacy. Therein lies a contradiction
inherent in Korean culture that has become a veritable tempest in a soup
pot.</TE>
<TE>   The long-standing practice of eating dog has come under fire of late
because of a well-publicized campaign by foreign animal rights activists
and because of the increasing popularity of dogs as pets.</TE>
<TE>   The flap started in November when the organizers of the World Cup
soccer games, to be co-hosted by South Korea and Japan in May and June,
publicly called on Koreans to "show the world that it is sensitive to
vociferous worldwide public opinion and that it rejects cruelty." Then
the French actress Brigitte Bardot touched a raw nationalist nerve by
accusing Koreans of savagery in the methods they use to slaughter dogs
for consumption.</TE>
<TE>   People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, a Norfolk, Va.-based
organization, in November submitted a petition signed by dozens of
celebrities asking the South Korean government to crack down on what it
calls the torture of cats and dogs. Cem Akin, the organization's lead
investigator on the issue, said the problem is not the use of dogs for
food but the methods of killing.</TE>
<TE>   "Dogs and cats, cows, sheep and chicken all have the ability to feel
pain. Our basic point is that all animals used as food should be kept out
of cruel food production methods. Culture and tradition are not an excuse
for cruelty," Akin said.</TE>
<TE>   To say that Koreans are defensive about this matter is an
understatement. Hardly a day goes by without an indignant editorial in
the South Korean press defending the eating of dog meat to the point
where it has become a national obsession. The editorialists cite
everything from anthropological theories of cultural relativism to
Confucian principles of hierarchy that make it acceptable for a human
being to consume animals of lower position.</TE>
<TE>   The official South Korean news agency, Yonhap, gloatingly reports the
discovery of a village in Switzerland where smoked dog meat sausage is a
local specialty, while China's ambassador to Seoul, Li Bin, was widely
quoted in the South Korean press after he spoke up at a breakfast meeting
of editors in support of dog-eating as an integral part of Korean
culture.</TE>
<TE>   A group of 167 prominent Koreans, including intellectuals, academics
and trade unionists, issued a statement last month denouncing Western
critics of dog-eating as "ethnocentric" and the "real barbarians for
failing to understand the relativity of culinary culture."</TE>
<TE>   "We do not understand the snail-eating, horse meat-eating cuisine that
some Westerners seem to like," read their statement. "Korea should not
attempt to appease [foreign] critics, for to do so is to betray their own
culture."</TE>
<TE>Issue Is Debated on the Internet</TE>
<TE>   An emotional and often ribald debate has erupted too on the Internet.
One angry defender of eating dog declares that Bardot likes dogs because
"animals can't talk back and tell her how stupid she is!!!"--one of the
few printable messages.</TE>
<TE>   Exasperated by the whole affair and eager to put the matter to rest
before the opening of the World Cup in May, the South Korean legislature
last month introduced a bill that would formally legalize the eating of
dog but regulate the manner in which canines are slaughtered. Although
electric shock is now widely used, traditional methods included burning,
boiling, strangling and beating, based on the belief that a frightened
animal experiences an adrenalin rush that makes its flesh a medicine
against male impotency.</TE>
<TE>   "Korean men would eat absolutely anything if they thought it would
increase their virility," complains Kum Sun Ran, the director and founder
of the Korean Animal Protection Society. The wife of a pharmacist, Kum
says that there is no medical evidence that dog meat cures impotency, but
that unethical dog meat vendors and restaurants sometimes slip
aphrodisiacs into the meat to promote the myth. "I try to tell the men
that even if it is true, now there is Viagra and they don't need to eat
dog. But they do not listen."</TE>
<TE>   Braving torrents of hate mail, Kum has led a lonely campaign here
against dog-eating. She regularly visits the livestock markets to see how
dogs are being treated and engages the salesmen in conversation. Her
argument is that it was OK for Koreans to eat dog back in the days when
it was a badly needed source of protein, but that the practice now should
rise beyond its past--and beyond other Asian countries where dog meat is
regularly consumed.</TE>
<TE>   "Korea is an affluent country. It can't be compared to Vietnam or Sri
Lanka or China. It is time for this abominable practice to be stopped,"
Kum said.</TE>
<TE>   An estimated 2 million canines are raised each year in South Korea for
dog meat--about the same number as are kept as household pets.</TE>
<TE>   In the shadow of the modern high-rises of downtown Seoul, you can find
live dogs offered for slaughter at a sprawling outdoor market. They are
huddled for warmth in small mesh cages, stacked next to ducks, chickens
and the occasional cat. (Although Koreans do not regularly eat cat meat,
some people believe soup of boiled cat to be a tonic against rheumatism.)</TE>
<TE>   "We've been eating dogs like this for a long time. My grandfather
raised dogs. It is part of our tradition," said Choi Il Jong, a vendor.
He says the dogs, most of them yellow-brown in color, are "what we
consider lower-grade mixed-breed dogs that are raised in the countryside.
We kill them by electric shock. They don't suffer."</TE>
<TE>   In 1988, when the Summer Olympics were held in Seoul, a similar
controversy erupted over dog meat, and the government tried to close down
dog restaurants to avoid offending foreign visitors. But the Koreans are
taking a harder line about defending their cuisine this time, and there
are no such moves underway today.</TE>
<TE>   South Korea is home to an estimated 6,000 restaurants that specialize
in dog. One of the best known is Sarijib, a traditional restaurant in
northern Seoul where customers sit around low tables on the floor and
feast on poshintang, literally "nutritional boost soup," which is said to
be helpful for people recovering from operations.</TE>
<TE>   "Doctors recommend dog meat. It is easier to digest than other meats,"
says waitress Park Sun Ae, serving up steaming bowls of the bright broth.
"We have a lot of customers who are singers and performers who want dog
soup to protect their voices, weak people too who need the nutrition. . .
. We even have people from the French Embassy."</TE>
<TE>A 'Clash' Between Older, Younger Generations</TE>
<TE>   Korean cuisine includes many ingredients that might make Westerners
pause. One popular dish that street vendors spoon out from gurgling
caldrons is pondaegi, a snack made of the larvae of silkworms. It is said
to be a favorite of children. In his book, "The Koreans," author Michael
Breen describes his first impression of Korean soups as full of "murky
items" that appear to have "been dropped in by mistake."</TE>
<TE>   But the dog meat flap is not merely a clash between Western and
Eastern civilizations. Many South Koreans too are squeamish about eating
dog.</TE>
<TE>   "There is certainly a clash between the older and younger generation,
and this is elegantly depicted by apartment complexes where you can find
a pet shop frequented by the young out in front and a dog meat restaurant
in the back alley," said filmmaker Bong Joon Ho, whose film "Barking Dogs
Never Bite" released in 2000 deals with the conflicts in a building
between dog lovers, dog haters and dog eaters.</TE>
<TE>   Traditionally, dogs were treated as farmyard animals, but their
popularity as household pets has soared in recent years as the country
has become more affluent. In middle-class neighborhoods, veterinary
clinics and pet stores selling expensive dog sweaters can be found on
almost every street.</TE>
<TE>   Even by the standards of Europe, where dogs are permitted in many
restaurants, South Koreans now go to extraordinary lengths to indulge
their pets. A Seoul movie theater recently hosted a film screening
designed for dogs and their owners. At least 10 cafes have opened in
South Korea in the past year that are designed specifically for dog
owners, and new cafes are reported to be opening regularly.</TE>
<TE>   BAU Haus, a cafe near Seoul's main art school, is crowded on a weekday
afternoon with mostly young women and teenage girls cooing over their
pets. The owner, former art student Jeong Jin Woo, who opened the cafe in
April, predicts that in the coming years the habit of eating dog will
gradually fade into oblivion with the passing of the older generation.</TE>
<TE>   "Our culinary culture cannot be changed overnight, but it is clear
that the dog-eating population is becoming smaller than the dog-owning
population," Jeong said. Though he himself owns 10 dogs, Jeong has tasted
dog and defends the tradition. "I love dogs, but it really is no
different from eating a cow or a sheep. An animal is an animal."</TE>
<TE>'We Koreans Have to Defend Our Traditions'</TE>
<TE>   Other Korean dog owners too are surprisingly tolerant of the
tradition. Kim Ju Young, owner of the beagle Blue, is so crazy about dogs
that she will only take a job where she can bring her dog to the office
and says she would defer having children if it would upset her dog. Yet
she too tasted dog as a girl--her parents secretly fed her dog meat soup
when she was preparing for exams to improve her health and performance.</TE>
<TE>   "We Koreans have to defend our traditions. I read once that the queen
of England eats pigeon for breakfast. Now that's disgusting," Kim said.</TE>

<DL>KABUL, Afghanistan
</DL>
<LD>Six-year-old Mamood and his 8-year-old brother, Raqib, held hands
and looked uncertainly at the grim concrete building here that was about
to become their home.</LD>
<LD>   The winter wind whipped the boys' thin shalwar kameez shirts and pants
as they glanced pleadingly at their mother, ghost-like in a blue burka
that hid her face.</LD>
<LD>   She nodded at them, disentangled her younger son's hand from hers and
pushed them toward several men standing at the doorway. One called
roughly to the boys, jerking his head in an indication they should come
in.</LD>
<TE>   This is Kabul's main orphanage, the last resort for desperately poor
parents who can no longer afford to care for their children.</TE>
<TE>   "What can I do? I have eight children and their father was killed by a
Taliban rocket," said the boys' mother, Shamin, who like many Afghans
goes by one name. "We have no money, I cannot care for them."</TE>
<TE>   Shamin was one of six parents--five widows and a widower--who had
brought their children to the orphanage on this January morning hoping
that their young ones would be accepted. There are about 430 boys in the
building and 450 girls and small boys in another building several miles
away.</TE>
<TE>   Desperately poor widows and their children are one of the enduring
legacies of the wars that have raked Afghanistan over more than two
decades. A survey done several years ago in the Kabul area by the United
Nations Children's Fund found about 35,000 widows with an average of six
children each.</TE>
<TE>   With few exceptions, the widows are extremely poor. During the Taliban
era, women were prohibited from working outside the home except in the
most menial, low-paying jobs.</TE>
<TE>   "Families have too many children, and for this reason when one parent
dies it is as if they were orphaned because they are economically so poor
that simple basic needs cannot be met," said Hafiza, a program officer in
charge of child protection for UNICEF in Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   The result for children is catastrophic. They are deprived of food,
heat and running water. Often they also receive little affection because
the beleaguered parents have so many mouths to feed that they can hardly
afford to spend time with each child.</TE>
<TE>   Most children are traumatized by the loss of at least one parent to
violent death and by the enormous disruptions of war. Nearly 90% of
children in Kabul, the capital, have seen looting and destruction of
houses and just as many said they believed they would die in the
fighting, according to a 1997 UNICEF study. The same report found that
54% of children interviewed reported seeing someone tortured.</TE>
<TE>   In such circumstances, parents covet a place for their children in the
country's orphanages, though the conditions inside are hardly better and
at times are worse than what the children would find at home. The new
administrators at the main Kabul orphanage say the Taliban directors
often stole money from the budget and strictly limited the education to
the study of Islam.</TE>
<TE>   The term "orphan" has taken on a somewhat different meaning in
Afghanistan than in the United States. Almost all the orphans here have
one living parent, usually the mother, who wants to remain connected with
their lives. Consequently, few of the children are available for
adoption.</TE>
<TE>   Several mothers waiting along with Shamin to drop off their children
at the main orphanage said they hoped to get jobs as cleaners at the
girls orphanage so that they would at least be near daughters left there.</TE>
<TE>   Inside the main orphanage, the scene is as close to Dickensian as can
be imagined in the 21st century, though the religious overlay is Muslim
rather than Christian. At mealtimes the children line up in a windy
courtyard and wait for the dining room to open. A man with a switch keeps
the hungry children in check, swatting those who make too much noise.</TE>
<TE>   Inside the dark, low-ceilinged room with its long wooden tables, the
children are issued a bowl of rice, a ladle of stewed kidney beans and
half a round of bread. They gobble the beans and poke at the bland rice.</TE>
<TE>   Mohammed Yasin, 14, sat quietly as he methodically ate his beans. The
food, he said, is the best part of life at the orphanage; before, he
never had regular meals.</TE>
<TE>   Like most of the children, he described his situation with a
controlled detachment. "I am fatherless and motherless," he said
matter-of-factly. "My father died in the fighting."</TE>
<TE>   It turns out he is not literally motherless; he just might as well be.
His father, an ethnic Uzbek from northwestern Afghanistan, was killed in
fighting against the Taliban. His mother remarried, and his stepfather
did not want Mohammed in his family. The boy was foisted off on an
impoverished grandfather who eventually sent him to the orphanage,
hundreds of miles from home.</TE>
<TE>   "I miss her, but even if I miss her, she still will not come,"
Mohammed said, looking away as he spoke.</TE>
<TE>   Hardest, he said, is the cold at night; many of the rooms are
unheated, and the damp, subfreezing winter temperatures are
bone-chilling. "We are not warm at night," he said. "We don't have an
electric stove or a wood stove or blankets, we don't have clothes to
wear. It is very difficult at night."</TE>
<TE>   But he still has dreams of something better. He hopes to have an
impact on a world that has abandoned him. He smiled shyly: "I want to be
a pilot or a doctor--something important."</TE>
<TE>   The girls orphanage is in a desolate, bombed-out neighborhood several
miles away. At one time it was extremely dangerous because of violent
fighting between Hazaras and Tajiks, ethnic groups that were vying for
control of Kabul in the early 1990s. Some adolescent girls were dragged
from the orphanage and raped or mutilated, according to staff members
with international organizations working in Kabul.</TE>
<TE>   Those days are over but the grim mood remains. Attempts to wash the
floors create a thin glaze of mud in the cold winter air, and there is a
fetid smell to the place, a combination of urine and sweat. The girls
stay indoors most of the time, a habit from the Taliban era when they
were not permitted to play outside. Thirteen or 14 to a room, they huddle
around the diesel oil stove that streaks the walls black and leaves a
heavy smell in the air.</TE>
<TE>   Here the signs of trauma are easier to see. While many of the boys
push, shout and fight to mask whatever pain they may feel, the girls are
silent, their eyes glazed. They look up nervously at the stern,
black-veiled orphanage mistress as they answer questions in soft
monosyllables.</TE>
<TE>   Frozan, 12, said she lost her mother "to the yellow-eye
sickness"--probably a form of hepatitis--and then her father "lost his
nerves." He no longer recognizes her, Frozan said, and so she does not
like to visit home anymore.</TE>
<TE>   Many of the girls describe losing their fathers to stray bullets
during the long years of fighting between the Northern Alliance and the
Taliban.</TE>
<TE>   One of the quietest in the room was Rayeesa, 10, who sat hugging her
knees. She has a striking combination of dark hair and blue eyes and is
one of the few children at the orphanage who is Pushtun, an ethnic group
dominant in southern Afghanistan but not in Kabul. Her father was going
to a bazaar to buy bread and was killed by "a missed bullet" intended for
someone else. Then her mother died slowly of the "yellow-eye disease,"
and Rayeesa and her two brothers and two sisters were orphaned.</TE>
<TE>   "My uncle brought us here and then he went to Iran, so no one comes to
visit us," she said, pulling her veil across her face. What would she
like to be when she grows up? "I want to be a teacher, if I am alive."</TE>
<TE>   Raihana, 9, sat apart from the other girls on one of the cots, staring
out the window. She looked down as she spoke and fingered her black
scarf, which sparkled with sequins. She lost her father several years ago
when Taliban soldiers in a car inadvertently ran into him. Soon after,
she and a brother and two sisters were sent to the orphanage. The pain of
the loss has yet to fade. She wanted to describe her father to a stranger
but could not find the words.</TE>
<TE>   "I miss my father a lot," she said. "He always would play with us and
he laughed and he had short hair."</TE>
<TE>   Many of these half-orphaned children are victims of the Afghan
tradition that widowed women remarry--often their former husbands'
brothers--and then the new husbands want to start their own family, said
UNICEF's Hafiza.</TE>
<TE>   "The new father doesn't like the children from the previous marriage,
first of all because of the poor economic conditions which make it
difficult for him to afford to care for six or seven children, and in
addition he wants to have children himself," Hafiza said.</TE>
<TE>   Raqib and Mamood, whose mother had brought them to the main orphanage,
walked uncertainly through the doors. One of the men gave them each a
piece of paper--their registration forms. They were marched to the
director's office and told to wait for him to sign the papers. They
looked with confusion at the office, which was carpeted and had
furniture--a rarity in most Afghan homes.</TE>
<TE>   Raqib's eye lighted on the bowl of Tootsie Roll candies that were

children.</TE>
<TE>   How did they feel now that they were entering the orphanage? Were they
afraid? Would they miss their mother and their other siblings?</TE>
<TE>   "No, I am not afraid," said Raqib softly and unconvincingly as he
clutched his brother's hand.</TE>
<TE>   He paused, then added: "If I am sad, what can I do?"</TE>

<HD>Attacks Redefine Bush Foreign Policy</HD>
<DH>Presidency: Response has reversed unilateral stance that irked
allies.</DH>

<LD>What a difference a war makes.</LD>
<LD>   When George W. Bush was inaugurated last year, he was widely seen as a
neophyte in world affairs. During the campaign, he'd been caught short on
the names of foreign leaders. He came to office with limited foreign
travel, much of it on vacations. And little of his father's long
diplomatic experience--at the United Nations, the CIA, in China and
during his own presidency--seemed to have rubbed off. The younger Bush
required extensive briefing before his first official trips within the
Americas and to Europe.</LD>
<LD>   Yet a year later, Bush's presidency has been shaped most distinctly by
his bold foreign policy. It already looks to be the nucleus of his
legacy.</LD>
<TE>   It wasn't by choice, of course. Bush set out to be a domestic
president whose top priorities were to cut taxes and reform education.
But Sept. 11 forced his hand--and transformed his presidency and approach
to the world.</TE>
<TE>   "Before Sept. 11, the Bush administration disdained foreign
intervention, was distrustful of working with other countries to achieve
international outcomes, was disengaging from international treaties, did
not support nation-building and did not believe in bailing out
financially troubled emerging markets," said Moises Naim, editor of
Foreign Policy magazine.</TE>
<TE>   "It had tense relations with China and Russia, considered Mexico its
best friend and viewed Pakistan as a pariah. But after 9/11, all of those
things were reversed. In essence, the Bush administration has had two
foreign policies--one before 9/11 and one after."</TE>
<TE>   The difference is striking. Secretary of State Colin L. Powell's early
travels defined the initial agenda: a Mideast trip to push streamlined
sanctions on Iraq; a Balkan tour to prevent yet another regional war in
Macedonia; an African trek to focus attention on the AIDS pandemic; a
summit of the Americas in Canada to promote regional trade and unity.</TE>
<TE>   The initial tone of Bush's foreign policy also contrasted sharply with
the schmoozing outreach of the Clinton era. Bush's "America first"
philosophy often came across as defiantly go-it-alone. And to many, even
allies, it signaled selective disengagement from the world.</TE>
<TE>   For critics, the code word was "unilateralism"--making decisions
without worrying much about other countries' reactions. Richard Haass,
director of policy planning at the State Department, countered by calling
it "multilateralism a la carte."</TE>
<TE>   Either way, the new tenor of Bush's foreign policy was evident on key
issues: The White House initially said it wanted to pull U.S. troops out
of the Balkans; it shied from serious intervention in the
Palestinian-Israeli conflict; it held big powers China and Russia at
arm's length.</TE>
<TE>   The administration also had some early collisions. It irked allies by
balking at the Kyoto Protocol on climate change. It triggered new anger
from China by pledging to defend Taiwan at whatever cost. It set off
alarm bells worldwide by revealing its intention to withdraw from the
1972 Antiballistic Missile Treaty.</TE>
<TE>   "Before Sept. 11, the Bush administration pursued a very dangerous set
of policies without any sense of the consequences around the world for
its unilateral approach," said James Steinberg, former deputy national
security advisor in the Clinton administration. "They were on a very
troubling course."</TE>
<TE>   Then four U.S. passenger planes were converted into weapons of mass
destruction in attacks that left an entire nation in mourning--and
feeling threatened.</TE>
<TE>   The Bush administration, with singular determination and energy,
responded by engaging with the world to launch a global campaign against
terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   The balance sheet for Bush's first year is, as a result, heavily
weighted by conduct over the last four months. And, although still far
from over, the Afghan campaign to rout the Taliban and Osama bin Laden's
Al Qaeda network has won Bush unprecedented popularity from the public
and praise from potential critics.</TE>
<TE>Bush Record Lauded by Former Clinton Aides</TE>
<TE>   "The Bush administration has done a very good job up to now in
Afghanistan," said Madeleine Albright, secretary of State under President
Clinton.</TE>
<TE>   Added Steinberg: "The administration has handled the war extremely
well, not only in operations on the ground but in effectively rallying
public and international support."</TE>
<TE>   Part of the administration's success is the product of a policy
flip-flop. To freeze terrorist assets and track down cells in dozens of
countries, the administration had to reverse course in its dealings with
other nations.</TE>
<TE>   The Sept. 11 attacks were "a wake-up call about the utility of
multilateralism or coalitions," said Terry Diebel of National Defense
University in Washington. "When Republicans think about multilateralism,
they think principally of its constraining aspects. But in these
circumstances, it makes it possible to do things that you otherwise
couldn't do. And to their credit, they adjusted."</TE>
<TE>   Bush may not deserve all the credit for the success, others say. In
contrast to the Clinton years, the public appetite for action made a war
possible, popular and even necessary for the first time in a
decade--since 1991's Operation Desert Storm against Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   "The great shift [between the two administrations] was not that the
weenies were gone and replaced by men with hair on their chest. It was
Sept. 11," said Michael Mandelbaum of Johns Hopkins University's School
for Advanced International Studies. "The country is now willing to pay
more."</TE>
<TE>   By its own reckoning, the Bush administration has scored other
successes in its first year: Relations with Russia have been transformed;
ties have deepened with Pakistan and India, without a tilt in either
direction for the first time in decades; Northern Ireland is back on the
peace track.</TE>
<TE>   The White House struck an agreement with Moscow to slash nuclear
warheads by two-thirds. And with minimum protest from Russia, it
abrogated the ABM treaty and is plowing ahead with tests for a missile
defense system.</TE>
<TE>   "That's not an inconsiderable list," said a senior administration
official.</TE>
<TE>   Critics counter that some key gains were a byproduct of the global
mood change after Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   "They have used the successful prosecution of the war to put through
controversial parts of their agenda," Mandelbaum said.</TE>
<TE>Policymakers Admit to Some Frustrations</TE>
<TE>   Bush's top policymakers concede that their first year also ended with
discouraging negatives.</TE>
<TE>   The labored Mideast peace process, seemingly close to resolution a
year ago, now appears further away from success than at any time since
the Palestinians and Israelis signed peace accords in 1993.</TE>
<TE>   A recession has slowed growth in 80% of world markets. And despite a
new round of trade talks that began two months ago, there are still
powerful forces--including European allies--opposed to taking further
steps to open markets.</TE>
<TE>   Policymakers admit frustration on other fronts, from China to
transnational issues such as acquired immune deficiency syndrome.</TE>
<TE>   The administration's dealings with the Chinese got off to a rocky
start due to the showdown over a U.S. spy plane. Relations began to mend
with Bush's visit to China in October, but both sides remain wary.</TE>
<TE>   "It's still a relationship not well defined," said the senior
administration official. "There's a strong debate in both capitals about
the nature of the relationship."</TE>
<TE>   After Powell's African trip, the AIDS pandemic was accepted as a
foreign policy problem worthy of attention by the administration. But so
far, it is being "managed, not solved," the official added.</TE>
<TE>   What began as a promising set of initiatives with Mexico seems to be
forgotten or abandoned. And there's little new overall policy on Latin
America.</TE>
<TE>   Several other issues have been left hanging.</TE>
<TE>   "On the environment, it's a catastrophe. They promised to come up with
an alternative to the Kyoto Protocol and they haven't," said Steinberg,
now director of foreign policy studies at the Brookings Institution in
Washington.</TE>
<TE>   Beyond specifics, many U.S. analysts are concerned about a long-term
vision for foreign policy, which they charge is still lacking.</TE>
<TE>   "The president shouldn't be congratulated for popularity of 90%
because he is not taking many of the essential steps needed in the long
run," said Dimitri Simes, president of the Nixon Center, a Washington
think tank.</TE>
<TE>   The military campaign in Afghanistan was a "no-brainer," he added,
that dealt with a specific problem but not the trend behind it.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a time not only for strong inspirational leadership but also
for a new architecture of world politics. We're now moving into new
territory, and I'm not sure the administration has an appreciation of the
complexities or hard choices that have to be made. I haven't seen any of
that thinking so far," Simes said.</TE>
<TE>   As it begins its second year, the Bush administration faces three
broad questions: Which of its first-year policies will prevail in 2002?
Will the administration be able to convert the Afghan victory into the
beginnings of a stable postwar order for both that region and the world?
And will the president divert sufficient attention from the war on
terrorism to address the growing list of the world's other woes?</TE>
<TE>   New Year's predictions are mixed.</TE>
<TE>   Some see the glass half empty. "The Clinton-Gore foreign policy had a
sense of global destination, with the United States intending to arrive
there with others," said Leon Fuerth, former national security advisor to
Vice President Al Gore, now at George Washington University. "There is no
such sense with this administration."</TE>
<TE>   Others see the glass half full. Naim, the editor of Foreign Policy,
said rather than viewing the two foreign policies of 2001 as
contradictory, he saw the evolution as a sign of flexibility and
adaptability.</TE>
<TE>   "'We could have had a group of staunch ideologues that in the face of
9/11 could have continued to espouse the views they offered in the
campaign," he said. "Instead, they were willing to shed their electoral
promises and platforms and react in a pragmatic, measured way that has
proven to be very effective."</TE>

<HD>Invisible War on Terror Accelerates Worldwide</HD>

<AU>ROBIN WRIGHT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>For all the focus on Afghanistan, the U.S.-led war on terrorism has
quietly picked up pace worldwide, with increasing results even in problem
areas ranging from Sudan in Africa and Yemen on the Arabian Peninsula to
the Philippines in Southeast Asia, according to U.S. officials.</LD>
<LD>   The United States has tangible evidence that terrorist attacks outside
Afghanistan have been disrupted, delayed or prevented by the four-month
global effort, the officials say.</LD>
<LD>   Often with U.S. assistance, the multipartite campaign has made
significant inroads in "busting cells and breaking down operations,"
according to a senior Bush administration official.</LD>
<TE>   The growing number of arrests and the freezing of financial assets are
"beginning to impair Al Qaeda operations and their ability to launch
terrorist actions," the official said, referring to Osama bin Laden's
far-flung terrorism network. "There are clearly instances where the lack
of funding is delaying or setting back operations."</TE>
<TE>   As the fighting winds down in Afghanistan, the focus will increasingly
be on this largely invisible half of the war and expanding it deeper into
areas such as Somalia, an unruly country on the Horn of Africa where Al
Qaeda has been active in the past--and still has ties, U.S. officials
say.</TE>
<TE>   "In terms of looking forward, what we're looking at is how . . . to
take down a global network. We haven't ever done that before," the
official said.</TE>
<TE>   Between 800 and 1,000 terrorism suspects have been arrested or
detained in more than 50 countries, not including the more than 640 held
in the United States, according to U.S. officials. Many of the foreign
arrests have not been made public.</TE>
<TE>   More than 140 countries have also frozen funds in 270 accounts with
assets of $65 million. Most of the arrests and frozen assets are linked
to Al Qaeda, but other extremist groups have also been affected.</TE>
<TE>   In contrast to the Afghan operation, the other half of the war so far
involves limited or no military use of American troops.</TE>
<TE>   "The military is not the preferred means and not necessarily the most
effective means. And not all military actions require the U.S. military,"
said a senior State Department official who spoke on condition of
anonymity.</TE>
<TE>   In the other half of the war, covert intelligence operations or
operations involving local militias or militaries are more likely to be
used, U.S. officials say. Each operation has been tailored to local
circumstances.</TE>
<TE>   "Besides, you don't need to shoot them all," the State Department
official added, referring to the terrorists. "You can choke off the links
and ties among groups and eliminate their bases. You can take away their
food and shelter and starve them and arrest them. That's underway in many
places where they used to be able to operate. We're doing things all over
the place."</TE>
<TE>   In the war outside Afghanistan, countries fall into one of three
tiers, according to administration officials. The first is made up of
countries, most notably in Europe, that have the will and means to act on
their own against terrorism. The U.S. role on the first tier has usually
been limited to sharing intelligence.</TE>
<TE>   The second tier includes countries that have the will but need active
support from U.S. law enforcement, intelligence, counter-terrorism or
military advisors. Support includes "all the things you can do without
putting [soldiers'] boots on the ground," said the senior State
Department official.</TE>
<TE>   The third tier consists of countries whose desire or ability to deal
with terrorism remains in question.</TE>
<TE>   The five nations under the most intense scrutiny in the invisible war,
because of their political environments or past links to Al Qaeda, are
Sudan, Somalia, Yemen, the Philippines and Indonesia, U.S. officials
said. Four are unstable Muslim nations, and the Philippines has a
militant separatist movement within its Muslim minority.</TE>
<TE>Power Vacuum in Somalia Feeds Concern</TE>
<TE>   Somalia has long been the biggest concern because conditions there are
even worse than in Afghanistan. Somalia is a largely destitute Muslim
country with a power vacuum and a highly armed population prone to
internal clashes.</TE>
<TE>   After Sept. 11, the Bush administration put the Somalian movement
Al-Itihaad al-Islamiya on its terrorist list and froze the assets of Al
Barakaat, Somalia's largest remittance firm, alleging that it was being
used by Al Qaeda.</TE>
<TE>   The United States is particularly interested in Ras Kamboni, an area
near the border with Kenya where Al Qaeda cells have operated in the
past, U.S. officials say. U.S. intelligence is also closely monitoring
the coastline for suspicious shipping traffic that might infiltrate Al
Qaeda forces back into Somalia.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. diplomat Glenn Warren went to Somalia last month on the first
visit by a U.S. official to the capital, Mogadishu, since 1995, to talk
with the 18-month-old transitional government of President Abdiqassim
Salad Hassan, who vowed to support U.S. efforts. A five-man military
mission also reportedly met last month with Somalian militiamen to
discuss possible Al Qaeda locations.</TE>
<TE>   After Warren's visit, Somalia arrested eight Iraqis and a Palestinian
on suspicion of ties to Al Qaeda. But the U.S. is skeptical about the
government's ability to follow through on those arrests, since it
controls only half of the capital.</TE>
<TE>   "Somalia, given the circumstances that exist there now, is one of the
areas we have to keep our eye on. We want to prevent them from being used
as a harbor for terrorism," State Department spokesman Richard Boucher
said Friday. "Al Qaeda elements have gone in and out of Somalia."</TE>
<TE>Interesting Progress With War-Torn Sudan</TE>
<TE>   But progress has been made even in some of these most vulnerable
countries.</TE>
<TE>   One of the most interesting breakthroughs has been in Sudan, Africa's
largest country, a war-torn nation where Bin Laden lived, ran terrorist
training camps and set up multinational business interests and a bank
from 1991 to 1996. Sudan remains on the State Department's list of state
sponsors of terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   But the country, ruled by an Islamic government, is now cooperating
closely with Washington, most notably by arresting about two dozen Al
Qaeda operatives and making them available to U.S. investigators for
interrogation, U.S. officials say. Sudan also has provided intelligence
data about Bin Laden's activities, allies and financial network.</TE>
<TE>   In the Philippines, U.S. troops have trained local forces, which have
carried out a series of raids on Muslim militants. Among them is the Abu
Sayyaf group, believed to have long-standing ties to Al Qaeda.</TE>
<TE>   After more than a year of tension with Yemen over the slow
investigation into the attack on the U.S. destroyer Cole in October 2000,
the U.S. turned a corner with the country after a visit to Washington in
November by President Ali Abdullah Saleh. Guided by U.S. intelligence on
individuals and locations, Yemeni forces launched raids in search of
militants in Marib province in mid-December, according to diplomatic
sources.</TE>
<TE>   Bin Laden's father was born in Yemen, and Al Qaeda has reportedly long
had operatives and allies in Hadhramaut province. After its worries about
Somalia, the U.S. has the greatest concern about Al Qaeda operatives
infiltrating into poor, overpopulated Yemen.</TE>
<TE>   Of the five nations under most intense scrutiny, the biggest unknown
is Indonesia, the most populous Muslim country, which is undergoing a
troubled political period.</TE>
<TE>   "Indonesia is potentially a real harbor for Al Qaeda elements and
Muslim extremists, and it's not clear what the attitude--or
capability--of the government will be to deal with it," the senior
administration official said.</TE>

<HD>Sharon Calls Arafat 'Bitter Enemy' After Major Arms Seizure</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TRACY WILKINSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>JERUSALEM
</DL>
<LD>Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon held Yasser Arafat personally
responsible Sunday for a massive cache of weapons intercepted in the Red
Sea, declaring the Palestinian Authority president "a bitter enemy."</LD>
<LD>   At a news conference in the Red Sea port of Eilat, where the Israelis
put the weapons on show, Sharon accused Arafat of attempting to thrust
the region into a wider war. He said the arms seizure exposed "the true
face" of the Palestinian Authority.</LD>
<LD>   Sharon's government, at a Cabinet meeting earlier in the day,
threatened to take even tougher action against the Palestinian Authority.
Formally declaring it an enemy would open up a catalog of potential
diplomatic and military reprisals and essentially end all possibility for
negotiation in the foreseeable future.</LD>
<TE>   The Palestinian Authority, meanwhile, continued to strongly deny any
involvement in the 50-ton shipment, and it offered to cooperate in a
probe into the weapons' provenance. Palestinian officials accused Israel
of a propaganda trick intended to undermine the mission of U.S. special
envoy Anthony C. Zinni--who, despite the arms controversy, ended a
four-day visit Sunday on a relatively optimistic note.</TE>
<TE>   "After four days of intensive discussions with Israelis and
Palestinians, it is clear that, while serious challenges remain, there
are real opportunities for progress," State Department spokesman Richard
Boucher said Sunday in Washington.</TE>
<TE>   Israeli commandos, in an operation dubbed Noah's Ark, boarded the
Karine-A vessel in the Red Sea 300 miles south of Israeli shores
Thursday. Israel says the ship belongs to the Palestinian Authority, and
the captain and several members of the crew are officers in the
Palestinian naval police.</TE>
<TE>   News agency reports from London, however, quoted the Lloyd's List
shipping registry as saying the vessel was owned by an Iraqi.</TE>
<TE>   Israel says most of the weapons, worth millions of dollars, came from
Iran, and it has accused the Palestinians of dealing with a state sponsor
of terrorism. Iranian officials also have denied involvement in the
smuggling operation.</TE>
<TE>   If the cache--which included long-range Katyusha rockets,
armor-piercing antitank missiles and C4 explosives--had reached the
Palestinians, it would have substantially increased Palestinian
firepower. Sharon said Israeli citizens throughout the country would have
been exposed to new danger.</TE>
<TE>   "Which is why he [Arafat] made himself irrelevant and into a bitter
enemy of Israel," Sharon said.</TE>
<TE>   Israeli army officials, releasing what they said was a detailed
description of how the weapons were procured, said the Iranian-backed
Lebanese guerrilla organization Hezbollah helped broker the deal three
months ago between Palestinian officials and contacts in Iran. The
Israelis were dismissive of reports from Washington that quoted U.S.
officials saying the weapons were more likely destined for Hezbollah, not
the Palestinian Authority.</TE>
<TE>   The army's report said the entire purchase was overseen by Arafat's
close aide Fuad Shubaki, who controls numerous Palestinian Authority
enterprises in the Gaza Strip. The army officials said the ship's
itinerary included stops in Sudan, Yemen and the Iranian-owned island of
Qeys and that it was headed for waters off Gaza, where the materiel was
to have been floated ashore in waterproof containers or picked up by
smaller boats.</TE>
<TE>   None of this could be independently verified.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't have any links or relationship with this ship, and this big
show Sharon has put on proves that Sharon doesn't have any real solutions
for the problems and big crisis that we are experiencing," Palestinian
Parliamentary Affairs Minister Nabil Amr said.</TE>
<TE>   Israel was clearly interested in using the interception to boost its
campaign to discredit and punish Arafat. Israeli authorities flew foreign
journalists and diplomats to Eilat for Sharon's news conference.</TE>
<TE>   Under international pressure, Arafat ordered his people on Dec. 16 to
halt attacks on Israelis, and violence has dropped off significantly
since. In addition, the Palestinian Authority says it has arrested scores
of militants and shut some of the offices used by Islamic radicals.</TE>
<TE>   Early Sunday, Palestinian police swept into a refugee camp near the
Palestinian-ruled West Bank town of Jenin and arrested seven members of
the Islamic Jihad organization, including one member reportedly on
Israel's most-wanted list. Ali Safouri is accused of responsibility in a
shooting attack in the Jordan Valley that killed two Israelis.</TE>

<HD>Activists Probe Reported Killings in Chechnya</HD>
<DH>Caucasus: Russian soldiers allegedly gunned down civilians during
season of revelry.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MAURA REYNOLDS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>MOSCOW
</DL>
<LD>Human rights workers are collecting what they describe as mounting
evidence that Russian troops committed unjustified killings and other
abuses during military operations in two towns in separatist Chechnya
over the last eight days.</LD>
<LD>   Usam Baisayev, deputy director of the regional office of the Russian
human rights group Memorial, said the first military operation began in
the town of Tsotsin-Yurt on Dec. 30 and appeared to target Chechen men.</LD>
<LD>   "The soldiers kept shooting at any Chechen male they saw for four days
in a row," Baisayev said from his office in the city of Nazran, on the
border with Chechnya. "They did not even bother to figure out whether the
person they were about to deprive of life is or was a member of a rebel
gang."</LD>
<TE>   The operations began as Russia shut down for the country's biggest
holidays--New Year's Day on Jan. 1 and Orthodox Christmas, which is
observed today. Most newspapers stop printing during the period, and TV
news broadcasts are reduced.</TE>
<TE>   Russian military officials have issued perfunctory reports about the
operations, saying the troops are rooting out rebels hiding among the
civilian population. The official reports have said Russian troops
"destroyed" 100 rebels, including several field commanders, during a
"special operation" in Tsotsin-Yurt. They have not mentioned any
detentions or arrests; officially, suspected rebels are supposed to be
taken into custody during an investigation into their activities.</TE>
<TE>   The second operation began in the town of Argun on Thursday to hunt
down as many as 30 alleged rebels who may have escaped from Tsotsin-Yurt,
according to official reports. No civilian was allowed into or out of
Argun for a fourth day Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   "The ring around militants is getting tighter," Col. Gen. Georgy
Shpak, commander of Russia's paratroop force, told the Itar-Tass news
agency Friday. "The troops are intensifying special operations because it
is easier to fight militants in winter."</TE>
<TE>   Russian officials say the Federal Security Service, the main successor
to the Soviet KGB, is overseeing the Argun operation along with military
and civilian prosecutors. They have reported that 38 suspected rebels
have been detained there.</TE>
<TE>   "I have been there myself today," Vsevolod Chernov, the chief
prosecutor of Chechnya, said in an interview broadcast Sunday on the TV-6
network. "There have been no complaints from the people. Military and
local prosecutors as well as representatives of the public--elders from
the city of Argun--are taking part in the operation."</TE>
<TE>Difficult to Verify Russian, Rebel Accounts</TE>
<TE>   Information about events in Chechnya is often fragmentary and
unverifiable because of poor communications and a lack of impartial
observers. Most Russian news reports are based on official statements
from military headquarters; the Chechen rebels' Web site routinely
exaggerates rebel gains. Information from other Chechen sources often
takes days or weeks to trickle out, usually via residents who leave the
republic on foot.</TE>
<TE>   Kheda Saratova, an investigator with Memorial, spent three days in
Tsotsin-Yurt before leaving Saturday and collected evidence that at least
37 civilians were killed by Russian troops. She said that in order to
retrieve the bodies, relatives of the victims were forced to sign a
statement acknowledging that their loved ones were members of rebel
groups.</TE>
<TE>   "Troops kill peaceful civilians and then try to pass them off as
rebels," she said in a telephone interview after reaching Nazran, in the
neighboring Russian republic of Ingushetia. "The military just grab
anyone who is at hand, and then the rest of the world has to trust their
'professionalism' when they say these people were bandits."</TE>
<TE>   Saratova cited the case of 37-year-old Musa Ismailov, a town mullah,
who was taken away by Russian soldiers in Tsotsin-Yurt on Dec. 30. As the
troops escorted him out the door, his 36-year-old wife, Malika, saw that
one of his ears had been cut off and that he was bleeding from the wound.
She tried to follow him, but a soldier threatened to shoot her. Later, to
retrieve her husband's body, she had to pay 1,000 rubles, or about $33,
to federal troops and sign a document saying he had been a rebel fighter.</TE>
<TE>   "This pretty much makes all members of our family fighters
automatically," the woman told Saratova, who transcribed the interview.
"And now I am afraid . . . that my 17-year-old son will take up a gun and
will try to avenge his father's death. And I will not be able to stop my
son. In fact, most of the people who are fighting against the federals
today and whom the federals call bandits are ordinary people who want to
avenge their relatives who were unjustly slaughtered by the federal
troops."</TE>
<TE>Theater Commander Reportedly Was Present</TE>
<TE>   Saratova said residents reported that many of the Russian soldiers,
perhaps because of New Year's revelry, appeared to be drunk during the
operations. She also said the troops had burned an unknown number of
corpses on the town outskirts.</TE>
<TE>   "The entire town reeks of burned flesh and putrefaction," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Saratova also said several residents reported seeing the commander of
Russia's troops in Chechnya, Lt. Gen. Vladimir Moltenskoi, in
Tsotsin-Yurt during the operation. Moltenskoi was also commander during
document sweeps, or zachistka operations, in the Chechen villages of
Sernovodsk and Assinovskaya in July that were denounced as cruel and
wanton even by pro-Kremlin officials in the region.</TE>
<TE>   Chechens and human rights workers say Russia's support for the United
States' anti-terrorism campaign in Afghanistan has had the side effect of
quelling international criticism of continuing Russian misdeeds in
Chechnya.</TE>
<TE>   "Most of the reports coming these days from [Tsotsin-Yurt] sound very
true," said Andrei A. Piontkovsky, director of the Independent Institute
for Strategic Studies. "Things that would several years ago make one's
hair stand on end today sound utterly commonplace.</TE>
<TE>   "Because Russia has turned out to be a very useful and instrumental
ally of the U.S. in fighting international terrorism, the West has
completely turned a blind eye to what is happening in Chechnya . . . ,"
he continued. "In the past, the West only meekly complained about
large-scale human rights violations in Chechnya. After Sept. 11, even
these complaints and humble criticism stopped. Now, everything is quiet,
and Russia feels it has got a free hand to do whatever it wants with
Chechnya."</TE>

<HD>India Says It Shot Down Spy Plane</HD>
<DH>Asia: Pakistani drone violated airspace over Kashmir, army claims.
Islamabad offers no immediate response.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PAUL WATSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NEW DELHI
</DL>
<LD>India's army said Sunday that it shot down an aircraft belonging to
Pakistan that was spying in Indian airspace over the disputed territory
of Kashmir, the hot spot in the simmering conflict between the two
countries.</LD>
<LD>   The reconnaissance plane, which India claimed had flown just inside
the western Poonch district of Jammu and Kashmir state, crashed in
Pakistan after Indian forces fired on it about 3:30 p.m. Sunday, India's
military said.</LD>
<LD>   "It was an unarmed aerial vehicle which intruded in Poonch sector,"
said an army source in Poonch who spoke on condition that he not be
identified because government officials had not formally responded to the
incident.</LD>
<TE>   "It was spotted and engaged, and when the engagement took place, it
was on its way back [to Pakistan]," the source added. "Whether it was
shot down or hit, the Pakistanis will tell you."</TE>
<TE>   There was no formal response from Pakistan on Sunday night.</TE>
<TE>   Some reports said the drone had penetrated two to four miles into
Indian territory. But the military source in Poonch, who said he had
visited the hilly border area immediately after the shooting, insisted
that the aircraft had not come more than half a mile into Indian
territory.</TE>
<TE>   Not long before the drone was shot down, another unmanned Pakistani
reconnaissance aircraft had entered Indian airspace in the same area,
Farooq Abdullah, chief minister of Jammu and Kashmir state, claimed on
Indian television.</TE>
<TE>   India and Pakistan have hundreds of thousands of soldiers facing one
another across the border and along a cease-fire line in Kashmir, in
their biggest military standoff in more than a decade.</TE>
<TE>   With these troops engaging in daily, though limited, clashes, the
downing of the reconnaissance craft is likely to ratchet up tensions
another notch just as there were signs that the atmosphere was easing
slightly.</TE>
<TE>   It is not common for unmanned aircraft to penetrate Indian airspace
along the front with Pakistan, said Col. Shruti Kant, an Indian military
spokesman.</TE>
<TE>   "These are used for spying only," Kant said in an interview. "But to
the best of my knowledge, it is not a very usual thing there."</TE>
<TE>   According to an Indian TV report that Kant could not confirm, the
Pakistani drone was flying very low, apparently photographing troop
positions, and hovered over Indian territory for 15 to 20 minutes. But
the military source in Poonch denied that the plane had been in Indian
airspace that long.</TE>
<TE>   The two armies traded heavy mortar and machine-gun fire after the
drone was shot, the television report added.</TE>
<TE>   India began a massive military buildup and threatened to attack
Pakistan after five gunmen attacked the Indian Parliament on Dec. 13. The
gunmen and nine other people died in the assault.</TE>
<TE>   India blamed two Kashmiri separatist groups based in Pakistan.
Pakistan's president, Gen. Pervez Musharraf, condemned the attack and has
since rounded up several hundred suspected extremists, but India says
more must be done before talks can begin to defuse the crisis.</TE>
<TE>   The drone incident is likely to feed anger in India just as the U.S.,
Britain and other foreign governments are trying to persuade the two
nuclear powers to start talking and cool off a confrontation that
threatens to erupt into war.</TE>
<TE>   Just as Musharraf has to stand tough to avoid appearing to cave in to
Indian threats, Indian Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee has an eye on
a looming election in the strategic northern state of Uttar Pradesh,
where his Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party is in trouble in
public opinion polls.</TE>
<TE>   Both sides have said repeatedly that they do not want a larger
conflict and have insisted that one isn't likely to break out. But their
forces are on high alert, with medium-range missile batteries at the
ready and fighter jets on standby.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier Sunday, Vajpayee and Musharraf chatted for about five minutes
in Katmandu, Nepal, where they were attending a summit of South Asian
leaders. But the two men later offered conflicting versions of what
significance, if any, the brief encounter had.</TE>
<TE>   Musharraf described it as "an informal interaction."</TE>
<TE>   "We only hope that this informal interaction will lead to a formal
interaction in the future," he said before leaving Katmandu.</TE>
<TE>   When Vajpayee returned to New Delhi, he dismissed the chat.</TE>
<TE>   "This was just a courtesy call," he said. "Not much was discussed."</TE>
<TE>   On Saturday, Musharraf had tried to break the ice between Pakistan and
India by striding across the stage after addressing the summit to shake
Vajpayee's hand.</TE>
<TE>   Looking annoyed, and then slightly amused, the Indian premier went
along with the gesture but then gave Musharraf the cold shoulder as the
Pakistani leader left the conference's opening ceremony.</TE>
<TE>   "I was not disappointed at all," Musharraf told reporters Sunday.
"Unfortunately, an embrace was not possible because there was a big table
in between us. But when I moved toward him, he did stand up, and he shook
hands quite warmly."</TE>
<TE>   Musharraf said a peaceful resolution of the crisis must come in two
steps.</TE>
<TE>   "We must remove the dangerous tensions, [the] standoff existing
between India and Pakistan," the Pakistani leader said. "This is in the
immediate context. And in a longer-term context, we need to address the
main disputes--all disputes--confronting India and Pakistan to settle
them in an amicable manner."</TE>
<TE>   The two countries' foreign ministries did exchange documents Sunday,
but details of the exchange were not made public.</TE>

<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>HARARE, Zimbabwe
</DL>
<LD>The nation's ruling party has launched a media blitz for President
Robert Mugabe's reelection bid, with a date for the March vote expected
to be announced soon.</LD>
<LD>   The weekend drive also coincided with reports that militants from
Mugabe's Zimbabwe African National Union-Patriotic Front, or ZANU-PF,
have stepped up a violent campaign against the main opposition, the
Movement for Democratic Change, ahead of the election.</LD>
<LD>   On Saturday, the MDC accused youths loyal to Mugabe of attacking one
of its offices and the home of a legislator, as violence rises ahead of
the presidential election. The MDC also said five of its supporters have
been killed in the last two weeks.</LD>
<TE>   ZANU-PF has been splashing a series of advertisements in both private
and state-owned newspapers, projecting the embattled former guerrilla
leader as a nationalist threatened by a Western-backed rival.</TE>
<TE>   The ads as well as dozens of articles in the government media praise
Mugabe's social, agricultural and economic policies and attack his
critics and rivals--mainly MDC leader Morgan Tsvangirai, who is expected
to give the 77-year-old president the toughest contest of his career.</TE>
<TE>   The government-owned Sunday Mail newspaper said Mugabe will announce
the March polling dates this week.</TE>
<TE>   Government officials were not available to comment on the newspaper
report, which was attributed to highly placed sources.</TE>
<TE>   In its media blitz, ZANU-PF calls its black opponents puppets of
former colonial power Britain and Zimbabwe's former white rulers.</TE>
<TE>   The white opponents are portrayed as racists who hanker for white rule
under the former Rhodesia, Zimbabwe's colonial name.</TE>

<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>BULLABURRA, Australia
</DL>
<LD>Heavy rain fell in parts of Australia for the first time in more
than two weeks, dousing flames today after weary crews of volunteers had
fought fire with fire, setting controlled burns to block blazes.</LD>
<LD>   Up to 2 inches of rain fell overnight, mainly in the Blue Mountains
national park 50 miles west of Sydney. Officials said wildfires that had
raced through the area since Dec. 24 had been reduced to smoldering
embers.</LD>
<LD>   However, they said that rain had not fallen in all fire-affected areas
and that the crisis in New South Wales state was not over.</LD>
<TE>   "There's a long way to go yet, but certainly there's no more welcome
sound to a firefighter than raindrops on a roof," said John Winter, Rural
Fire Services spokesman.</TE>
<TE>   Weather forecasters said that the rain showers broke an 18-day dry
spell. They warned, however, that high temperatures approaching 100 could
return later today, bringing dry outback winds that could help rekindle
fires.</TE>
<TE>   The bush fires have burned across Australia's most populous state for
two weeks. About half of the original 100 fires were set deliberately,
and 24 people--including teenagers and a 9-year-old--have been arrested,
officials said.</TE>
<TE>   About 20,000 firefighters have battled the fires.</TE>
<TE>   No deaths have been reported, although thousands of people have been
evacuated and about 170 homes destroyed.</TE>
<TE>   As much as 1.2 million acres of forest and farmland have been razed.</TE>
<TE>   Wildlife officials estimate that thousands of native Australian
animals, including koalas, have been killed or injured in the fires.</TE>

<LD>Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi named himself interim foreign

and a dispute with Berlusconi over his coalition's unenthusiastic
reception of the euro currency.</LD>
<LD>   Berlusconi sought to assure his European allies that Italy's foreign
policy would support further political and military cooperation in Europe
even without the pro-European Union Ruggiero in the ministry.</LD>

<LD>France kicked off the 200th anniversary of the birth of "Les
Miserables" author Victor Hugo, who the country's press said was one of
the earliest advocates of the euro.</LD>
<LD>   The Journal du Dimanche weekly reprinted extracts of Hugo's
impassioned 1855 call for a "United States of Europe" and a "continental
currency, resting on all Europe as its capital and driven by the activity
of 200 million men."</LD>
<LD>   "This currency alone would replace and bring down all the absurd
varieties of money that exist today, with their effigies of princes,
those symbols of misery," it quoted the leftist firebrand as saying.</LD>

<DL>BOGOTA, Colombia
</DL>
<LD>Colombia's second-largest guerrilla army has accused the armed
forces of endangering the peace process by stepping up military actions
during a unilateral rebel truce that ended Sunday.</LD>
<LD>   The National Liberation Army, or ELN, vowed to halt kidnappings and
bombings of oil pipelines and electrical towers during the 20-day truce
that began Dec. 18.</LD>
<LD>   In a communique read late Saturday to local RCN radio, ELN founder and
leader Nicolas Rodriguez said the rebels had fulfilled their promise but
accused the army of using the truce to secure military gains.</LD>
<TE>   Rodriguez said the actions raised "grave questions for a real peace
process."</TE>
<TE>   There was no immediate response from the government of President
Andres Pastrana, who had welcomed the holiday truce as a step toward
peace.</TE>

<HD>U.S. Troops Leave for Cuba to Set Up Afghan War Prison</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBIN WRIGHT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>The first of about 1,500 U.S. troops began heading for the U.S.
Navy base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, on Sunday to build and then protect a
maximum-security prison for up to 2,000 Al Qaeda and Taliban prisoners
from Afghanistan, the Pentagon said.</LD>
<LD>   An initial group of prisoners--fewer than 100--will be transported to
the new prison within the next 10 days. The largest share of the U.S.
troops will be military police from Ft. Hood, Texas, according to Lt.
Col. Dan Stoneking, a Pentagon spokesman.</LD>
<LD>   The troop movement came as U.S. and local forces in Afghanistan
continued their hunt for Osama bin Laden, Taliban leader Mullah Mohammed
Omar and other top officials of the Al Qaeda network and the deposed
Afghan regime.</LD>
<TE>   The government of Uzbekistan, on the northern Afghan border, told a
delegation of U.S. senators touring the Central Asian region that its
intelligence service now believes the Saudi militant has slipped out of
Afghanistan, according to Sen. John Edwards (D-N.C.).</TE>
<TE>   The presence of Bin Laden and his entourage in Pakistan would put
pressure on President Pervez Musharraf, who is struggling to deal with
crises both on his nation's border with Afghanistan and along a volatile
frontier with India.</TE>
<TE>   "I fully expect the Pakistanis will do everything they can to help us
locate Bin Laden," Edwards said on "Fox News Sunday."</TE>
<TE>   In Afghanistan, where he was visiting an orphanage in the capital,
Kabul, interim Prime Minister Hamid Karzai said he had no knowledge of
Omar's whereabouts.</TE>
<TE>   Replying to reporters' questions, Karzai said: "We are looking for
him. We will arrest him."</TE>
<TE>   U.S. planes flew constantly over southeastern Afghanistan on Sunday
afternoon and could easily be heard and seen as they traversed the skies.
The Pakistan-based Afghan Islamic Press said U.S. aircraft had bombed
targets in eastern Afghanistan's Spinghar mountain range near the
Pakistani border during the night, flying at least six sorties, but the
report could not be independently confirmed.</TE>
<TE>   The jets were believed to be targeting suspected members of Al Qaeda,
some of whom are thought to remain at large in southeastern Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   On the outskirts of Kabul, some distance away, a contingent of the
first international peacekeeping troops to arrive in the capital was
starting repair work on Kabul International Airport. French troops were
removing land mines in preparation for repairing the runway and other
areas so that the facility can once again receive flights.</TE>
<TE>   Currently, the only planes flying into the Kabul area land in Bagram,
about 35 miles to the north.</TE>
<TE>   At the moment, the U.S. military is holding more than 300 Taliban or
Al Qaeda members, the vast majority at a base near the airport in the
southern city of Kandahar. Others are being held on the amphibious
assault ship Bataan in the Arabian Sea, at the Bagram air base and in the
northern city of Mazar-i-Sharif.</TE>
<TE>   Among those being held on the Bataan are John Walker Lindh, the
20-year-old Californian who fought with the Taliban. On Sunday, Ibn
Al-Shaykh al-Libi, who helped run Bin Laden's terrorist training camps in
Afghanistan and who was turned over to the U.S. last week by Pakistan,
was expected to be taken to the ship soon.</TE>
<TE>   The new facility in Cuba will take special precautions in holding the
detainees in light of difficulties that have arisen in confining
prisoners in Afghanistan. In Mazar-i-Sharif, a prison uprising led to the
death on Nov. 25 of CIA officer Johnny "Mike" Spann, the first American
to be killed by the enemy in Afghanistan, and of dozens of Afghans.</TE>
<TE>   "Many of these people have demonstrated their determination to kill
others, kill themselves or escape, and we're using the necessary amounts
of constraints in order to build appropriate facilities for these
detainees," said Lt. Cmdr. Jeff Davis, a Pentagon spokesman. "We are
cognizant of the incident that took place in Mazar-i-Sharif."</TE>
<TE>   But U.S. officials also said that the prison standards will conform
with international conventions and that the Red Cross will have access to
all those held on the 45-square-mile base at Guantanamo Bay.</TE>
<TE>   "Their treatment and their detention will be humane," Davis said.</TE>

<HD>Wiccan Chaplain Brews Storm</HD>
<DH>Religion: Some taxpayers want the Rev. Jamyi Witch removed from her
state job counseling prisoners.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEPHANIE SIMON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>MOUNT HOREB, Wis.
</DL>
<LD>It started out as a simple job search. But it turned into a witch
hunt.</LD>
<LD>   Make that a Witch hunt. For the person hired last month as Wisconsin's
newest prison chaplain was the Rev. Jamyi Witch--who said she long ago
chose that last name "because I am one." Witch is proud to be a witch and
the first Wiccan priestess in the nation to serve as a full-time state
prison chaplain.</LD>
<LD>   Yet her appointment has put some taxpayers in a tizzy.</LD>
<TE>   A state representative--from, of all places, West Salem--is leading a
drive to yank funding for Witch's $32,500-a-year post, saying taxpayers
"shouldn't be forced to accept this hocus-pocus." Two other lawmakers
have joined him in outrage; one called Witch's appointment "morally
dangerous." Meanwhile, callers have swamped the prison switchboard, the
state Legislature and radio talk shows with pro-Witch or anti-Witch
tirades. And they've contacted the new chaplain directly too: One day she
came home to 76 phone messages and 432 e-mails.</TE>
<TE>   "It's been off the Richter scale," state Rep. Scott Walker, a
Republican who is lobbying to boot Witch from her post, said with a sigh.</TE>
<TE>   Walker said his constituents are fiercely opposed to Chaplain Witch.
But Witch said she's received mostly supportive calls. Aside from a few
death threats, she said, "the overwhelming consensus has been: 'You go,
girl. We're behind you.' "</TE>
<TE>   She has cried, at times, in the tumult of the last few weeks. But
mostly, Witch has managed to keep her chin up. And no, there's not a wart
on it.</TE>
<TE>   Witch, 43, is accustomed to people looking around for the pointed hat
and broom when they meet her. To her, however, "witch" is simply a
religious description--like "Protestant" or "Jewish." It denotes a
practitioner of Wicca, a pagan religion that sees the divine in every
element of nature. Exact numbers are hard to come by, but religious
scholars estimate there are at least 50,000 Wiccans in this country and
perhaps as many as 200,000.</TE>
<TE>   Wiccans--and Witch--do practice magic. But it's not eye-of-newt
abracadabra. Witch's brand of magic involves focusing psychic energy on a
worthy goal, using meditation to achieve good. It is, she said, just
another word for prayer.</TE>
<TE>   And it can be used only for healing. Wiccans are absolutely forbidden
to use magic to enact curses.</TE>
<TE>   That prohibition disappointed some of the inmates Witch counseled as a
volunteer minister in several prisons before she got the chaplain job at
maximum-security Waupun Correctional Institution in southeast Wisconsin.
"I lost a lot of men when I explained it. If they didn't have the power
to melt prison bars, they weren't interested," she recalled with a
chuckle.</TE>
<TE>   Still, several inmates--sometimes a dozen or more--stuck with Wicca at
each prison she visited. "Those who felt the calling of Mother Nature and
Goddess Earth stayed," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Witch stayed too, drawn to the volunteer work, feeling a "sacred duty"
to help the prisoners find a path to a better life. Although she changed
her last name (from Welch) in part to spark conversation about her faith,
Witch insists she never proselytizes. She works only with those who come
to paganism on their own. "I'm never out to convert, just inform," she
said.</TE>
<TE>   Her critics, however, don't trust her. And they have nightmares of her
using her chaplain's post to suck criminals into the "cult" of bizarre
ritual that Wicca represents to them. In their view, a chaplain should be
showing inmates that they're accountable to an almighty God, not showing
them how to sprinkle herbs as offerings to the goddesses of Mother Earth.
"There isn't one study that I'm aware of that shows that witches have
reformed any prisoners," said Republican Rep. Mike Huebsch, the lawmaker
from West Salem.</TE>
<TE>   Stung by the brouhaha that Witch's appointment has stirred, the warden
at Waupun declined requests for interviews. Last month, however, he
defended Witch as the best of nearly a dozen candidates he had
interviewed--with the character to do the job well. "Jamyi is an
outstandingly approachable person, somebody that I wouldn't mind
approaching on spiritual matters myself," Warden Gary McCaughtry told the
Milwaukee Journal Sentinel.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to her volunteer prison ministry, Witch has worked with
battered women in shelters and dying patients in hospices. A mother of
two, she is a Girl Scout leader and school volunteer here in Mount Horeb,
an artsy town that bills itself as "the troll capital of the world"
because the main street is lined with carved wooden trolls.</TE>
<TE>   Witch earned her ordination as a Wicca priestess from a nearby
congregation called Circle Sanctuary. There is no formal theological
curriculum--no seminary for pagans--but High Priestess Selena Fox said
Witch spent years studying the Wiccan faith and counseling pagans in
crisis in preparation for ministry.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm a good person. I really am," Witch said, rubbing the ears of a
sick old greyhound she rescued after his racing career ended. "I have
earned this position."</TE>
<TE>   State officials say Witch does indeed meet all the requirements for
the job of chaplain, and they point out that it would be illegal to deny
her the post on the basis of her faith. Members of hate groups or satanic
cults are not allowed to serve as chaplains. But in Wisconsin, Wicca is
recognized as a religion on par with Catholicism or Islam.</TE>
<TE>   While several states, including California, allow volunteer Wiccan
chaplains in their prisons, Witch is the first to land a full-time,
tax-funded post.</TE>
<TE>   "Jamyi has made history," Fox said.</TE>
<TE>   Critics point out that just 30 out of 1,200 inmates at Waupun identify
themselves as Wiccan. (There is one other full-time chaplain there, a
Protestant.) "Why are we paying a woman $35,000 a year to work with just
30 inmates?" asked Walker, the state lawmaker.</TE>
<TE>   In response, Witch notes that a large part of any chaplain's job is to
bring in volunteer ministers of other faiths, so that all spiritual needs
can be met. For instance, she recently organized a religious feast,
presided over by a visiting imam, for Muslim inmates to mark the end of
Ramadan.</TE>
<TE>   Chaplains also are responsible for making sure all prisoners have the
tools they need to worship, be it a Bible or sacred crystals. In fact,
Witch said, very little of her job involves one-on-one spiritual
ministry, although when called upon, she said she can offer guidance to
anyone of any faith. Without resorting to witchcraft.</TE>
<TE>   "They think I'm teaching all the inmates to chant spells," she said
with a rueful smile. "If I had one-eighth of the power that people are
crediting me with, I wouldn't be sitting in Waupun Correctional
[Institution] working my butt off. I'd have my patootie up on a velvet
cushion with people throwing grapes at me. Or cheeseburgers."</TE>

<HD>Bush's Advisors Defend Tax Cuts</HD>
<DH>Politics: The fiscal plan's value in stimulating the economy should
offset deficit concerns, aides say.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID WILLMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>President Bush's top economic advisors said Sunday that the value
of quickly implementing more tax cuts should outweigh Democrats' concerns
about future budget deficits that might be created by those cuts.</LD>
<LD>   In separate appearances on television talk shows, the Bush officials
also rejected the allegation--made last week by Senate Majority Leader
Tom Daschle (D-S.D.)--that the president's first wave of tax cuts had
worsened the recession.</LD>
<LD>   The sparring over tax policy and the recession open the midterm
congressional election year, in which control of the Senate and the House
hangs in the balance.</LD>
<TE>   In Bush, the Republicans have a president whose popularity has soared
with his handling of the battle against terrorism. Democrats, however,
intend to hold Republicans accountable for the sagging economy, including
an unemployment rate that has risen to a seven-year high of 5.8%. And, by
decrying tax cuts that they say disproportionately benefit the affluent,
the Democrats hope to position their candidates as more compassionate and
fiscally responsible than Republican office-seekers.</TE>
<TE>   It is in this context that the president, at an event in Ontario,
Calif., on Saturday, referred to the Democrats by saying they would
repeal his signature 10-year tax cut only "over my dead body."</TE>
<TE>   On Sunday, Bush's senior economic team mounted a more detailed
offensive.</TE>
<TE>   Treasury Secretary Paul H. O'Neill dismissed as "just not credible"
estimates that Bush's $1.35-trillion tax cut package would eat up to 70%
of the projected budget surpluses over the next decade. That package was
passed by Congress and signed by Bush in June and resulted in
$300-per-taxpayer rebates.</TE>
<TE>   The full breadth of the tax cuts is subject to yearly congressional
votes and presidential action.</TE>
<TE>   "I think people who believe as a religion in 10-year numbers haven't
lived in the real economy," O'Neill said on NBC's "Meet the Press,"
adding: "We need to deal with the here and now. We need to take the
action that's necessary now . . . to speed up the recovery."</TE>
<TE>   O'Neill estimated that the tax cuts already implemented account for
"about" a 25% reduction to the projected budget surplus.</TE>
<TE>   On Nov. 28, federal budget director Mitchell E. Daniels Jr.
acknowledged that because of a "costly convergence of factors"--including
the slowing economy, the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks and the tax cut--the
federal budget would run at a deficit at least until 2005. Previously,
the government had predicted years of surpluses.</TE>
<TE>   O'Neill, who in his first year as Treasury secretary has not seemed to
relish partisan sparring, appeared to undermine Bush's rhetorical blast
about Democrats wanting to raise taxes. Asked whether rescinding or
postponing some of the $1.35 trillion in cuts should now be "on the
table" for bipartisan negotiation, O'Neill said, "I have not seen anyone
say they want to raise taxes."</TE>
<TE>   Bush's secretary of Commerce, Don Evans, said Sunday that trying to
stimulate the economy through tax cuts was more important than worrying
about the erosion of projected budget surpluses.</TE>
<TE>   "I think we need to focus on today and what's happening right now,"
said Evans, appearing on CNN's "Late Edition." ". . . Exactly what the
budget is going to be over the next three to five years, you know, is
pure speculation at this point. What we need to focus on is getting this
economy moving again."</TE>
<TE>   Bush is backing an additional tax-cut package similar to one passed
last month by the House, totaling about $110 billion. Daschle used his
power in the Senate to block that legislation; the White House wants it
revived.</TE>

<HD>A New Worry About an Old Concern: Health Care</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RONALD BROWNSTEIN</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Suddenly, all of the vital signs for America's health care system
are pointing toward the danger zone. The conditions are coalescing for a
surge in the ranks of the uninsured, similar to the crisis of the early
1990s that helped drive President Bush's father from office--and then
nearly destroyed Bill Clinton's presidency when he tried to respond.</LD>
<LD>   "We are likely to see a jump in the number of people who are uninsured
this year that is greater than anything in the past decade, at least,"
says Ron Pollack, executive director of Families USA, a health care
advocacy group.</LD>
<LD>   In the coming months, the rising number of Americans without health
insurance is likely to become a growing public concern, even as the
return of federal budget deficits crimps Washington's capacity to reverse
the trend. That gap between need and response, between will and wallet,
may help sharpen to a point the approaching debate over whether the
country can still afford all of the 10-year, $1.35-trillion tax cut Bush
pushed through Congress last spring.</LD>
<TE>   Health care became a huge issue in the early 1990s because of a
vicious circle of rising costs and reduced access. As health insurance
premiums soared (up 12% in 1988 alone), employers responded by dropping
coverage or forcing employees to bear more of the cost, which compelled
many low-income workers to decline coverage. Rising unemployment in the
recession of the early 1990s compounded the problem. The result was an
explosive rise in the number of uninsured, from 31 million in 1987 to
nearly 40 million when Clinton took office in 1993.</TE>
<TE>   That rapid erosion in coverage inspired Clinton's 1993 effort to
restructure the health care system. His goal was both to control costs
and guarantee universal access. But his plan was too vast and complex,
and it collapsed--a victim of both its own weight and the determined
resistance of virtually every interest group in the health care world,
from insurers to small employers.</TE>
<TE>   Yet even amid the wreckage, the storm that raged through the health
care system in the early 1990s seemed to blow over by the middle of the
decade. Insurers got a better handle on costs, largely by pushing more
workers into managed care programs that limited access to expensive
services. That allowed the insurers to hold down employer premium
increases to as little as 1% by 1996, according to a Kaiser Family
Foundation survey.</TE>
<TE>   That price restraint gave employers the means to expand coverage. And
the tight job market of the late 1990s gave them the motivation to lure
new workers with health insurance. In Kaiser surveys, the share of
employers offering health insurance jumped from 55% in 1998 to 67% in
2000. At the same time, with their treasuries bulging, the states and the
federal government in 1997 agreed on an innovative partnership to fund
insurance for the children of the working poor, the Children's Health
Insurance Program (known as CHIP).</TE>
<TE>   Taken together, these developments reversed the seemingly inexorable
rise in the uninsured. The number of Americans without health insurance
peaked in 1998 at 44 million and by 2000 had fallen to 39 million. (The
2000 figure isn't exactly comparable to the earlier numbers because of a
change in Census Bureau procedures, but all experts agree the trend was
toward greater coverage in the late 1990s.)</TE>
<TE>   But these gains now look like merely the calm between storms. Indeed,
one expert Jonathan Cohn recently quoted in a trenchant New Republic
article on the health care dilemma says the country faces virtually
"perfect storm" conditions for another rise in the uninsured.</TE>
<TE>   The spiral of rising cost and reduced access is spinning again.
Skyrocketing drug costs, tougher negotiating by hospitals and doctors,
and a consumer and political backlash that has forced insurers to loosen
the reins on managed care are all driving up the price of insurance.
Kaiser found that employer premiums jumped 11% last year, and experts
such as Emory University's Kenneth E. Thorpe say the country can expect
"a long-term acceleration" in insurance costs that will renew pressure on
employers to drop or scale back coverage.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, rising unemployment means more workers are losing their
insurance along with their jobs. The slackening labor market also is
reducing pressure on employers to court workers by offering coverage at
all. (Ominously, the share of employers offering insurance dipped
slightly in 2001.) And the budget squeeze is pressuring states to
retrench their programs for the uninsured. California Gov. Gray Davis
recently shelved for two years a planned expansion of CHIP to working
adults; Tennessee is looking to trim 180,000 people from its Medicaid
rolls.</TE>
<TE>   These factors may have swelled the number of Americans without health
insurance by at least 1 million in 2001 and possibly more, experts say.
The figures for this year could be just as bad.</TE>
<TE>   Which ought to raise the question of how Washington will respond as
the health care safety net unravels. Before the Sept. 11 attacks, the
Senate Finance Committee appeared ready to advance bipartisan legislation
(sponsored by Massachusetts Democrat Edward M. Kennedy and Maine
Republican Olympia J. Snowe) that would spend $28 billion over the next
three years to help states expand CHIP to the working-poor parents of
eligible children.</TE>
<TE>   That legislation now faces a murky future. Part of the difficulty is
that Bush prefers to help the uninsured with tax credits to buy
individual policies (though Thorpe's research has found that the
government can cover twice as many workers per dollar by expanding CHIP
than extending tax credits). The larger problem is that recession, war
and the cost of Bush's tax cut have consumed the federal budget surplus
that might have paid for expanding coverage.</TE>
<TE>   More federal money alone won't solve the deepening problem of health
care access; without greater public and private efforts to control costs,
those dollars will never go far enough. But while federal money may not
be sufficient, it's the indispensable foundation of a solution; without
Washington intervention, the problem seems certain to worsen. As the
number of Americans without health insurance rises in the coming months,
so too may the questions about whether the country can still afford all
of the tax cut it promised itself last spring.</TE>

<DH>Pro basketball: Early emotion means little for the Raptors as
Bryant scores easy 31 points in a 109-89 victory.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TIM BROWN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>TORONTO</DL>
<LD>Admittedly, it amuses the Lakers when they come to these towns, and
they see these people, made hysterical by these early leads, in January.</LD>
<LD>   And they look over and see these opponents waving their arms in the
air, begging their crowds for more hysteria, and then these foes clench
their fists when the first jumper falls, and pound their chests when they
make another.</LD>
<LD>   "We're getting to the point, it puts a smile on our face," guard Derek
Fisher said, "when we see everybody get excited--\o7 overly\f7
excited--early in the game."</LD>
<TE>   The Lakers beat the Toronto Raptors, 109-89, before a sellout crowd
Sunday afternoon at the Air Canada Centre, where Kobe Bryant scored 14 of
his 31 points in the third quarter, many straight at Vince Carter, in the
first of a five-game trip.</TE>
<TE>   They trailed by nine points in the first quarter, and nine again in
the second quarter, and then put the worst home defeat of the season on
the Raptors with a rush of points and defense.</TE>
<TE>   Two days before, they beat the Phoenix Suns by 32, so the average
margin of victory since Shaquille O'Neal returned from the injured list
is 26 points, about his scoring average.</TE>
<TE>   "We've developed that kind of fortitude," Fisher said, "where we don't
get discouraged."</TE>
<TE>   It is an easier confidence with Bryant and O'Neal together, in body
and spirit. O'Neal had 24 points, six rebounds and four assists, though
he played only 15 minutes of the second half. Matched more often against
Jerome Williams than Carter in the first half, Bryant scored 15 points,
then was five for nine from the field and four for four from the line in
the third quarter.</TE>
<TE>   "All right, man," Williams told Bryant near the bus afterward. "They
didn't let me guard you in the third, man."</TE>
<TE>   Bryant laughed.</TE>
<TE>   His last 10 points of the quarter came in a span of 2:12 late in the
period. Carter, who scored 24 points, drew fouls three through five in
the last 3:42 of the quarter. The Lakers took a six-point halftime lead
and pushed it to 14 before the Raptors scored the final basket of the
quarter.</TE>
<TE>   "Just finding a rhythm, waiting for the right time to start being more
assertive," Bryant said. "You go through the game and you just read the
defense. For example, you see a gap the first couple minutes of the game,
it might not be wise to attack it at that point in time. But you know
that gap is there, so you come back to it later on."</TE>
<TE>   O'Neal was on the bench for Bryant's final eight points of the third
quarter.</TE>
<TE>   "Shaquille's presence in the game really doesn't have that much of an
impact on that," Bryant said. "It's a matter of feeling the momentum, and
who's in and who's in foul trouble, different matchups. That determines
my decisions."</TE>
<TE>   Coach Phil Jackson saw it differently.</TE>
<TE>   "He knows when Shaq leaves the game it's a chance to explore and play
the way he wants to," he said. "And he did very well in doing so."</TE>
<TE>   With 3:16 left and the Laker lead 21 points, trainer Gary Vitti ripped
the pad from Bryant's right side and flipped it over the bench to Chip
Schaefer, the club's athletic performance coordinator.</TE>
<TE>   It was not entirely bloodless for the Lakers, who have won four in a
row.</TE>
<TE>   Rick Fox was elbowed in the mouth by Eric Montross with 5.54 left in
the third quarter and played two minutes while swallowing the blood from
that. In fact, he made his only shot--a three-pointer from the
top--between taking the elbow and having his upper lip stitched shut by
Toronto's team doctor.</TE>
<TE>   Beyond that, and a first-quarter lapse in defense in which the Raptors
scored on nine consecutive possessions, the Lakers were precise and
forceful, as they were in Friday's win over the Suns.</TE>
<TE>   The Raptors were distressed that they were awarded only five free
throws to the Lakers' 29, but there was a reason they stayed out of the
lane.</TE>
<TE>   "The general is back," O'Neal said. Carter missed the fourth quarter
in Los Angeles because of a shoulder injury, and could have--and maybe
should have--missed the last 21/2 quarters here.</TE>
<TE>   He had received a technical foul because of his over-the-top reaction
to a call early in the second quarter, and another technical would have
meant automatic ejection.</TE>
<TE>   The opportunity for it came five minutes later, at midcourt on the
right sideline.</TE>
<TE>   As Carter dribbled up the floor, Horry caught him and stopped him with
his left arm. Carter became incensed and flailed at Horry with his right
hand, an attempt either to free himself or punch Horry.</TE>
<TE>   Horry then grabbed a fistful of Carter's jersey.</TE>
<TE>   Referee Rodney Mott separated the two as Carter shouted at Horry, "Let
me go! Let me the ... go!"</TE>
<TE>   Often, that would be a double technical foul, one on Horry and one on
Carter. Mott also made a gesture toward Horry that suggested he had
ejected Horry.</TE>

<HD>Raiders Gasp Into Playoffs</HD>
<DH>Pro football: Oakland loses third consecutive game as Hall's
53-yard field goal gives Jets a 24-22 victory and a spot in postseason.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SAM FARMER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>OAKLAND</DL>
<LD>As the Oakland Raiders reluctantly begin their Super Bowl run, they
might want to weld rearview mirrors to their helmets. They lost their
third consecutive game Sunday--24-22 to the New York Jets--and are moving
so rapidly in reverse they should be beeping.</LD>
<LD>   "We didn't want to limp into the playoffs," receiver Tim Brown said.
"But that's the way we're going to do it."</LD>
<LD>   Each team had enticing incentives. The Jets (10-6), who were0-8-1
against the Raiders on the road, needed to win to guarantee a playoff
spot. The Raiders, who clinched the AFC West with a Dec. 15 victory at
San Diego, would have gotten a week off had they won.</LD>
<TE>   Instead, the Raiders (10-6) will host the Jets in a wild-card game if
Baltimore beats or ties Minnesota tonight. If the Ravens lose, Seattle
will play at Oakland. Either way, the game will be Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   Raider Coach Jon Gruden was in no mood to discuss the possibilities,
not after watching the Jets return a blocked punt for a touchdown and
seeing fill-in kicker Brad Daluiso miss an extra point and a 28-yard
field goal.</TE>
<TE>   "Right now," Gruden said, "I've got to stick my head in an ice
bucket."</TE>
<TE>   The true ice man was Jet kicker John Hall, whose 53-yard field goal
with 59 seconds to play clinched the victory and left anguished Raiders
scattered all over the turf. It was Hall's longest kick in three seasons
and helped ease the sting of an especially painful miss last season.</TE>
<TE>   In Week 15 of the 2000 season, the Jets had a chance to secure a
playoff berth but lost to Detroit, 10-7. Hall was wide on a 35-yard
attempt with 12 seconds to play, blowing a chance to tie.</TE>
<TE>   So, when Hall was asked Sunday if it helped that the Raiders didn't
call a timeout before his kick and he didn't have to think about it, he
said: "I've had a year to think about it."</TE>
<TE>   Now, the Raiders are left to replay this loss in their minds. They led
three times, the last coming when Daluiso made a 37-yard field goal with
6:05 remaining for a 22-21 edge.</TE>
<TE>   The Jets got the ball back, went nowhere and had to punt. That meant
the Raiders had possession and a chance to burn the final three minutes.
Instead, they mustered a three-and-out, culminating with Rich Gannon
overthrowing a wide-open Roland Williams. A successful connection might
have gone for a 63-yard touchdown.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think anybody checked me on that," said Williams, who earlier
found himself all alone on an 18-yard touchdown.</TE>
<TE>   Presented with another opportunity, the Jets took full advantage.
Relying on the arm of Vinny Testaverde, who threw two interceptions
earlier, they moved to the Oakland 35. On fourth and six, with the
sellout crowd of 62,011 on its feet, Hall hammered his kick down the
middle.</TE>
<TE>   "I looked at the distance and thought it was either going to be wide
left, wide right or short," cornerback Charles Woodson said. "But he
nailed it. That's the way it's gone the last few weeks."</TE>
<TE>   Each Raider loss this season has come down to a decisive drive or play
in the game's final moments.</TE>
<TE>   "We haven't been beaten," Brown said. "In the six games we've lost
this year, we gave every one of them away."</TE>
<TE>   No wonder Gruden felt the urge to soak his head.</TE>
<TE>   Watching in street clothes on the Raider sideline, his hands stuffed
deep in the pockets of his coat, was kicker Sebastian Janikowski. He is
said to be suffering from cellulitis on his kicking foot, didn't practice
all week and was only released from the hospital Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   Daluiso, the former UCLA kicker, reached the Super Bowl with the New
York Giants last season, and, although he was committed to staying in
shape this season, figured his career was over. He was happy to get the
work when the Raiders called last week, but he has a financial-consulting
job lined up in San Diego and sees this as his last hurrah.</TE>
<TE>   That it wasn't an especially successful hurrah didn't seem to bother
him much. He was uncertain Sunday night of his future with the team,
though he knows he's gone when Janikowski returns.</TE>
<TE>   "I'd like to have made that 28-yarder, and I don't like missing extra
points," Daluiso said. "But I'm not going to lose any sleep over it."</TE>
<TE>   Then again, he's an accidental tourist in this whole affair. The
Raiders, who have more invested, will be losing plenty of sleep,
particularly if they are unable to solve the mystery of their missing
ground game (Oakland and Arizona are the only teams without a 100-yard
rusher this season), their turbulent kicking situation and their sudden
inability to slam the door on teams.</TE>
<TE>   "I guess you could say we've hit a wall," Woodson said. "Right now,
we're at the top of the wall and maybe we can jump on over."</TE>
<TE>   Gannon, who took heat from teammates and coaches last week when he
said the Raiders lack discipline, was far more guarded in his comments
Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   He was disappointed, clearly, but hardly critical.</TE>
<TE>   "Despite what people think, we're a confident football team," he said.
"We believe we can win the whole thing."</TE>
<TE>   With that, Gannon ended his postgame comments. He pushed back his
chair, stood and walked off the dais with a blank expression. Probably in
search of Gruden's ice bucket.</TE>

<KH>WEEK 17 IN THE NFL</KH>
<HD>Season of Giving Continues for Favre</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE PENNER</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Somebody has an awful lot of explaining to do, but until that
happens and the NFL completes a full-scale investigation, let the record
book read:</LD>
<LD>   Most Sacks, Season</LD>
<LD>   22.5* Michael Strahan, New York Giants, 2001</LD>
<TE>   (*Unless you believe, as most impartial/rational observers do, that
Brett "Chan Ho" Favre grooved one for his golfing buddy in the last three
minutes by calling a running play in the huddle, winking at Strahan at
the line of scrimmage, taking the snap and rolling out as if to pass
before hook-sliding into the shins of an unblocked Strahan, who then
appeared to fall over laughing on top of Favre for a quote-unquote
"official sack" that enabled him to, ahem, surpass Mark Gastineau's old
record of 22.)</TE>
<TE>   And here we thought the XFL had gone out of business.</TE>
<TE>   The events of Sunday, Jan. 6, 2002, during the waning moments of the
Green Bay Packers' 34-25 victory at Giants Stadium, had a distinct WWF
whiff about them, and you don't need Oliver Stone to tell you which way
the wind blows.</TE>
<TE>   Consider, if you will, the following:</TE>
<TE>   1. Strahan, a good friend of Favre's, began the final week of the
season with 21.5 sacks--half a sack shy of the league record Gastineau
set in 1984 while playing for the New York Jets. Days before kickoff,
Favre told reporters, with a smile, that "I might give it to him early. I
don't want to say give it to him [and] ask him to take the next three
quarters off. Work out a little side deal."</TE>
<TE>   2. After barely failing to run down Favre before the quarterback could
throw the ball away in the second quarter, Strahan wrapped his arm around
Favre, who wrapped his arm around Strahan and playfully patted the Giant
defensive end on the top of his helmet.</TE>
<TE>   3. Strahan still was sackless as the game entered the final three
minutes, with Favre and the Packers virtually assured of victory, having
nothing to lose if the quarterback suddenly decides to take a dive.</TE>
<TE>   4. Immediately after his mysterious audible, which produced the
league's most suspicious-looking sack since Jim Everett sacked himself in
the 1989 NFC championship game against San Francisco, Favre was
congratulated by appreciative pats on the back and head from jubilant New
York defensive players.</TE>
<TE>   "That was classy of Brett to do that," said Giant offensive tackle
Lomas Brown, and it's unfortunate for Favre that players do not vote for
the most valuable player award. He'd have the New York bloc locked up.</TE>
<TE>   5. Green Bay tight end Bubba Franks, who allegedly was supposed to
block Strahan on the decisive play, closely resembled a swinging gate.
Afterward, Franks pleaded confusion. "That was called as a running play,"
he said. "I don't know if it was a bad snap or what. I was run-blocking.
I didn't know it was a pass."</TE>
<TE>   Favre was less than convincing when asked if he had gifted the record
sack to Strahan.</TE>
<TE>   "No, I didn't," he replied with a straight face. "That was a 'keep
pass.' I tried to get to the edge but he got through."</TE>
<TE>   Strahan: "I just react to what happens. He was booting out on the same
play earlier and I missed him.... This time he went down and I hopped on
him. What am I supposed to do? Get up and say, 'Brett! Why didn't you
throw it?"'</TE>
<TE>   Oh, he threw it all right.</TE>
<TE>   Next year, just to mix it up, Favre might consider sending a necktie.</TE>
<TE>   Speaking of record-breaking farces, the Carolina Panthers became the
first team in NFL history to lose 15 consecutive games in one season by
way of a 38-6 rollover against the New England Patriots.</TE>
<TE>   This, on the face, sounds impressive--until you consider that this
option was not available to the 1976 Tampa Bay Buccaneers, who were
limited to 14 regular-season games and lost every one of them. And then
some. The 1977 Buccaneers started 0-12, extending their losing streak to
26 games, a league record and a tough way to start up a
franchise--although comforting to the 2002 Houston Texans.</TE>
<TE>   It didn't do much for Panther rookie quarterback Chris Weinke, an old
man with no hair when he began this season. When Weinke examines the
curve of his three-year performance chart, he can give thanks he's not a
tech stock.</TE>
<TE>   Weinke in 1999: Undefeated national champion at Florida State.</TE>
<TE>   Weinke in 2000: Unable to produce a point in a 13-2 title-game loss to
Oklahoma.</TE>
<TE>   Weinke in 2001: Unable to produce a victory after a season-opening
fluke at Minnesota--and you'll notice what that number did for Viking
Coach Dennis Green's career advancement.</TE>
<TE>   However, Weinke has yet to be dumped, unlike his coach, George
Seifert, who is expected to be dismissed today. And the rumored
replacement for Seifert? Can you say Steve Spurrier, who used to coach at
Duke before moving on to Florida and probably--just guessing here--might
want someone quarterbacking his team who isn't 30, a Seminole and prone
to serving up touchdown-scoring interceptions?</TE>
<TE>   More records set Sunday:</TE>
<TE>   * Marshall Faulk shredded Atlanta's defense for 226 total yards in a
31-13 St. Louis victory to become the first player to amass 2,000 yards
from scrimmage in four consecutive seasons. Teammate Kurt Warner,
however, fell a couple of completions short of the second 5,000-yard
passing season in league history, finishing with 280 for the day and
4,830 for the season.</TE>
<TE>   * Emmitt Smith became the first back to rush for more than 1,000 yards
in 11 consecutive seasons. Smith got the mark with 77 yards in 18 carries
in the Cowboys' season finale, a 15-10 loss to Detroit that doubled the
Lions' victory total and left Smith grousing about the achievement, "It's
very sour."</TE>
<TE>   * Keith "RV" Traylor stayed on his feet, without fainting, to complete
the slowest 67-yard dash in league history after intercepting a pass
during Chicago's 33-13 victory over Jacksonville.</TE>
<TE>   It would have been the slowest 76-yard dash in league history, but
Bear teammates Mike Brown and R.W. McQuarters, pushing Traylor as if he
were an RV with a dead battery, couldn't shove him the final nine yards
to the end zone. Jaguar receiver Keenan McCardell caught Traylor from
behind and told him, "That's the longest you've ever run."</TE>
<TE>   Traylor laughed between gasps for oxygen and spluttered, "You're
right."</TE>
<TE>   With the victory, the Bears clinched their first NFC Central title
since 1990, a first-round bye and two weeks off for Traylor to recover.</TE>

<HD>Knight Perks Up the Bruins' Day</HD>
<DH>College basketball: Senior guard has a career-high 32 points in
81-69 victory over Washington State.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE HENSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Knight and day has nothing to do with opposites. It's like peas and
carrots, a horse and carriage, or any other corny saying about a perfect
match.</LD>
<LD>   Give Billy Knight a basketball with the sun high in the sky outside
the gym. Watch the points rain.</LD>
<LD>   The UCLA senior scored a career-high 32 points in an 81-69 victory
over Washington State on Sunday afternoon at Pauley Pavilion, the Bruins'
ninth win in a row and fourth without a loss in Pacific 10 Conference
play.</LD>
<TE>   Knight made six of nine three-point shots, including three in the
first seven minutes. His teammates got him the ball early because, well,
that's the way he likes it.</TE>
<TE>   He typically rises by 6 a.m. and is in the gym by 7. And unless
there's a night game, he's in bed when many college students are prowling
around at parties.</TE>
<TE>   "Not many good things happen at night," he said. "So I sleep then and
get up early."</TE>
<TE>   The earlier the game, the better. Five of his six highest-scoring
games last season came in day games, including his previous career-high
of 22 points against Stanford.</TE>
<TE>   "Last Wednesday he was coming out of the Wooden Center gym at 1 p.m.
when the rest of the team was showing up for practice," Coach Steve Lavin
said. "He's always somewhere shooting."</TE>
<TE>   Knight also enjoyed playing on a Sunday. Normally, he's up early for
church. "I knew it was going to be a good day because God was watching
over me," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The crowd of 8,834 saw the day go UCLA's way down the stretch after
the Bruins (11-2) continued another pattern--this one somewhat
disturbing--of letting an inferior opponent stay too close for comfort.</TE>
<TE>   Washington State (4-8, 0-4) tied the score, 59-59, with 8:15 to play,
and it took another scoring string by Knight to create a comfortable
margin. He made a three-point shot with 7:10 left, sank two free throws
and a 14-foot shot to put the Bruins up, 69-61, then followed four Cougar
points by nailing a three-point shot with 2:44 to play.</TE>
<TE>   A short time later the Bruin student section began chanting, "Beat
SC," a reference to the matchup between the cross-town rivals Thursday at
the Forum.</TE>
<TE>   That game is on everyone's mind.</TE>
<TE>   "[Trojan seniors] Brandon Granville and David Bluthenthal are my
friends, and I know they are real salty about losing, they want a win
against us," Knight said.</TE>
<TE>   USC has defeated the Bruins once in the last 14 meetings. But that
streak pales in comparison to UCLA's dominance over Washington State,
which has lost 19 in a row to UCLA and has never defeated the Bruins in
Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Even an inspired performance from flu-ridden Mike Bush couldn't change
Cougar fortunes. The senior guard helped keep Washington State within
39-38 at halftime with 13 points, six rebounds and three assists. But his
energy waned in the second half, and he finished with 18 points and did
not add a rebound or assist.</TE>
<TE>   In contrast, Jason Kapono was cold in the first half and solid in the
second--still another Bruin pattern. He scored 12 of his 16 points after
halftime, including a putback of his missed shot with 1:03 left to extend
the lead to seven.</TE>
<TE>   "He always makes some sort of big play down the stretch, always,"
Washington State Coach Paul Graham said.</TE>
<TE>   "You have to be aware of where he is, so when Billy Knight shoots the
way he did, it's tough. Then just when you forget about Kapono, he kills
you."</TE>
<TE>   Feeding Knight and Kapono were Matt Barnes, who had seven assists, and
Rico Hines, who had four. Barnes has 15 assists in the last two games.</TE>
<TE>   Hines took three charges and although he scored only two points in 27
minutes, his tenacity on defense helped limit the Cougars to 41.1%
shooting.</TE>
<TE>   UCLA is 9-0 since Hines became a starter when freshman guard Cedric
Bozeman had knee surgery. Bozeman has come off the bench the last two
games, and was less effective than he was Thursday against Washington,
committing four turnovers in six first-half minutes and scoring two
points.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, none of the three Bruin freshmen contributed much--Dijon
Thompson scored two points, Andre Patterson scored three, and neither had
a rebound.</TE>
<TE>   "They'll all come around," Knight said. "They are great players. They
just need playing time and consistency."</TE>
<TE>   And, he could add, enough sleep. That's the proven method to have a
Knight-like day.</TE>

<HD>Trojans Keep Up in Pac-10</HD>

<LD>USC may be getting fat, but are the Trojans eating healthy?</LD>
<LD>   Jumping to a 4-0 start in Pacific 10 Conference play is one thing.
Doing it with consecutive sweeps of the Washington schools may be cause
for deeper debate, however.</LD>
<LD>   USC's 94-74 blowout victory over Washington Sunday night gives the
Trojans an eight-game winning streak and an overall record of 12-2
heading into Thursday's showdown with No. 14 UCLA.</LD>
<TE>   Just don't ask Trojan Coach Henry Bibby to scrutinize his team's early
season strength of schedule.</TE>
<TE>   "Washington is not a bad basketball team, and you're not going to see
a more athletic team than Washington," Bibby said. "We played well
tonight, and you have to give us credit. Who do we have to play, Duke?"</TE>
<TE>   The defending national champions would most definitely give USC a
better game than the one Washington offered up in front of 3,597 at the
Forum. The Huskies were mere fodder on a night when the Trojans had five
players score at least 15 points, led by senior small forward David
Bluthenthal's 18 points.</TE>
<TE>   Senior power forward Sam Clancy, senior point guard Brandon Granville
and freshman shooting guard Errick Craven each scored 17 points, and
sophomore guard Desmon Farmer had 15 off the bench.</TE>
<TE>   Washington sophomore forward Doug Wrenn led all scorers with 29
points.</TE>
<TE>   "On any given night any one of us can go for 20 [points], and the
others will play well," said Bluthenthal, who also had five rebounds,
four assists and three steals in a USC-high 36 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   "We've won all four [conference] games pretty handily and that shows
me that we're playing a full 40 minutes and it shows consistency. We're
not playing down to our level of competition, so that shows we're
consistent with our play."</TE>
<TE>   USC's smothering full-court defense sparked its offense in scoring a
season high in points.</TE>
<TE>   The Trojans forced 26 turnovers, an opponent season high, and had a
season-high 21 steals while beating the Huskies for a series-high seventh
consecutive time and sending them to their sixth consecutive loss.</TE>
<TE>   Washington (6-8, 0-4) actually had a better shooting percentage from
the field than USC, 47.2% to 45.2%, but USC outscored Washington, 32-12,
in points off turnovers.</TE>
<TE>   "That's what we talk about every day--let our defense create our
offense," said Granville, who had his second consecutive double-double
with 10 assists. He also tied a career high with six steals and had three
rebounds in 28 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   "This is giving us confidence, the new guys a lot of confidence. We're
a good team that can be as good as we want to be. We've got a long way to
go, but it feels good to get out to a good start."</TE>
<TE>   After Washington got out to a 5-4 lead, USC clamped down and staged a
clinic on defense while working its transition game to near perfection.
The Trojans embarked on a 25-5 run and led by 19 points less than nine
minutes into the game.</TE>
<TE>   "The three guys you expect to have a huge impact for USC--Granville,
Clancy and Bluthenthal--were very good, but they also had some other guys
step up," Washington Coach Bob Bender said. "That's the thing with USC.
If you try to stop those guys, the others step up. They are a very deep
team."</TE>
<TE>   Clancy, who had a career-high five steals, said the Trojans won't be
walking on air heading into their game against UCLA, the only other team
that has an undefeated Pac-10 record.</TE>
<TE>   "We're not the type of team that will get overconfident," Clancy said.
"We haven't played our best basketball yet.</TE>
<TE>   "We won't get any respect until we beat someone in the top 25."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Five Trojans--Clancy, Gennaro Busterna, Kostas Charissis, Jerry Dupree
and Anthony Saadey--reported cash was stolen out of their lockers at the
Forum during Friday night's victory over Washington State. Police took
statements from the players Sunday.</TE>

<LD>Dan LeBatard of the Miami Herald, commenting on the New York
Yankees and Mets passing on signing free-agent slugger Barry Bonds: "They
didn't think Bonds was worth the risk at his age [37]? The Dodgers will
give Kevin Brown $105 million until he's 41. Bonds is more likely to be
playing at 40 than Brown is.</LD>
<LD>   "Someone as jagged as Bonds wouldn't fit in the Yankees' gentlemanly
clubhouse? Please. You make room for 73 homers."</LD>

<TE>   Trivia time: Who holds the NFL record for receptions in a game?</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Get him! Tony Kornheiser of the Washington Post has some advice for
Redskin owner Dan Snyder: Go after Steve Spurrier.</TE>
<TE>   "He's the most intriguing figure in college football. Year after year
he orchestrates the most pyrotechnic offensive show in the land. Spurrier
saying he wants to give the pros a try is like Mike Krzyzewski saying it.
You only have to hear it once. Then you rush to the phone....</TE>
<TE>   "He'll run it [the score] up on anybody--and he'll let you score so he
can get the ball back and run it up some more."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   More Spurrier: The quarterback of the 1976 Tampa Bay Buccaneers, who
went 0-14, celebrated when the 0-12 Lions finally won a game this season.</TE>
<TE>   "Hey, if the '72 Dolphins can toast their perfection, why can't we
toast our imperfection?" he said. "The Lions winning kept all my banquet
jokes alive."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Class act: New England Patriot quarterback Drew Bledsoe lost his
starting job to Tom Brady, but he's not grumbling about it. In an
interview with Dan Shaughnessy of the Boston Globe, he said: "It's real
simple. It's the way I was taught. It's the way I was brought up. Handle
yourself with dignity and self-respect regardless of what the situation
is. That's always the choice you have. You look at it and do the right
thing."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Clip and save: Greg Hansen of the Arizona Daily Star, commenting on
Oregon's basketball team: "I'm telling you, Oregon will be the darling of
the national media by February, breaking into the top 10 or 15 spots in
the polls and going to Maples Pavilion [Stanford's home court] in the
most important game the Ducks have played since the Pac-10 expanded 24
years ago."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Whatever you say: Said Kevin Garnett of the Minnesota Timberwolves on
the possibility of playing point guard because of a knee injury to
starter Terrell Brandon: "It ain't like I can't."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Ouch! Peter Vecsey in the New York Post: "It's official. The Knicks
have blown more leads than the Boulder police."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Looking back: On this day in 1972, the Lakers defeated the Atlanta
Hawks, 133-99, to increase their NBA-record winning streak to 33 games.
Two days later it ended in Milwaukee as the Lakers lost to the Bucks,
120-104.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Trivia answer: Terrell Owens of San Francisco, 20, against Chicago on
Dec. 17, 2000.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   And finally: Cornelius "Dutch" Warmerdam, who died in November, was
arguably history's greatest pole vaulter. He was the first man to clear
15 feet, in 1940, and it was \o7 11 \f7 years later that Bob Richards
became the second. Richards once said of Warmerdam: "[He] was part
sprinter, part shock absorber, part acrobat and part strongman. He wasn't
human."</TE>

<LD>   What: 1958 Sebring 12-Hour Grand Prix video</LD>
<LD>   Producer: Alex Xydias, Historic Auto Racing Videos</LD>
<TE>   Price: $24.95 plus $4.95 S&amp;H to P.O. Box 11316, Burbank, Calif. 91510.</TE>
<TE>   During the '50s, sports car racing was the hottest motor racing ticket
in the country other than the Indianapolis 500. NASCAR was still a
regional stock car circuit for boys from the Carolinas, so the big races
were on the road at Sebring, Torrey Pines, Palm Springs, Road America and
Watkins Glen, N.Y.</TE>
<TE>   Alex Xydias, a pioneer Bonneville Dry Lakes competitor, toured the
sports car circuit, filming the races.</TE>
<TE>   After many years, he has put them together on video tape.</TE>
<TE>   For younger racing fans, the tapes offer a remarkable contrast with
today's high-tech atmosphere. For older fans, it is another touch of
nostalgia. For instance, most amusing are clips of the great Stirling
Moss practicing his LeMans start, in which drivers line up across the
road from their cars and at the starting gun, race like track stars to
their cars.</TE>
<TE>   Obvious is the lack of today's safety net. There are no roll cages,
the pit stops are done almost casually with little accent on speed. At
one point, when his car stops before he reaches his pit, Carroll Shelby
jumps out and starts pushing it himself.</TE>
<TE>   The entry list was filled with exotic names, such as Aston Martin,
Ferrari Testa Rossa, Jaguar, Porsche and Lotus, with equally exotic
drivers such as Phil Hill, Mike Hawthorn, Roy Salvadori, Jean Behra,
Shelby and Moss.</TE>
<TE>   Xydias gives the video a homespun atmosphere when he introduces the
race the way a doting uncle might introduce his family in a home movie.
For the record, the 12-hour race is capsuled into 36 minutes.</TE>

<HD>Garcia Is on Way to Goal With Victory at Hawaii</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Spain's Sergio Garcia set his goals high and took a big leap in the
first golf tournament of the year, making birdie on the first playoff
hole Sunday to defeat PGA champion David Toms in the Mercedes
Championships at Kapalua, Hawaii.</LD>
<LD>   Garcia, who wants to win the money list on the PGA Tour and the
European tour, holed a 10-foot birdie putt on the 18th hole in regulation
to close with a nine-under-par 64 and force a playoff with Toms, who
missed a birdie putt from about the same distance.</LD>
<LD>   They finished at 18-under 274.</LD>
<TE>   Returning to the 18th for the playoff, Toms hit a sand wedge from
mangled rough to about 30 feet and two-putted for par.</TE>
<TE>   Garcia, 21, pitched to about 10 feet past the hole and made the putt
to claim the $720,000 winner's check.</TE>
<TE>   No one has won the money titles in the U.S. and Europe in the same
year.</TE>
<TE>   "You can't dream of a better way to start the year," Garcia said.</TE>
<TE>   Tiger Woods had enough money to do it in 1999 and 2000, but didn't
play enough European events to be a member.</TE>
<TE>   Garcia plans to play the minimum 15 in the U.S. and 11 in Europe.</TE>
<TE>   Woods closed with a 65 and finished in a tie for 10th, seven strokes
behind.</TE>
<TE>   Aware of a threatening letter containing cyanide sent to the U.S.
Embassy in New Zealand last month, Woods said he had no plans to withdraw
from the New Zealand Open.</TE>
<TE>   "You have to go on living your life," Woods said. "It's unfortunate
that people have these types of views and do these types of acts."</TE>
<TE>   New Zealand police said the threats were directed at the tournament
and not Woods, but added the threats were made because Woods was
scheduled to play.</TE>

<TE>   Florida junior offensive lineman Mike Pearson said he will make
himself available for the NFL draft.</TE>
<TE>   Pearson graduated in December and is planning to be married in the

<TE>   Other Florida underclassmen--cornerback Lito Sheppard and receivers
Jabar Gaffney and Reche Caldwell--have said they plan to leave.</TE>
<TE>   Junior receiver Taylor Jacobs, the most valuable player in the Orange

lock up the one spot the American women are guaranteed at the Olympics.</TE>
<TE>   DeWitt, last year's World Cup champion, defeated Brian McDonald by
eight-hundredths of a second.</TE>
<TE>   The United States is expected to secure the third spot for DeWitt
based on team World Cup standings, but that won't be known until after
competition in Switzerland on Jan. 17.</TE>
<TE>   Nick Sullivan beat Jon Myles in a two-day raceoff at Park City,
earning the last spot on the U.S. Olympic men's luge team.</TE>

30, finishing ahead of countrywoman Hannah Hardaway (25.47) to win a

<DL>TORONTO</DL>
<LD>The sweetest sound of an NBA regular season is silence.</LD>
<LD>   What's the opposite of buzz? Malaise? Yeah, that.</LD>
<LD>   "It's a great feeling to go in an arena and make them quiet," Laker
forward Robert Horry said. "They're yelling at you, booing at you,
calling you names, then all of a sudden, they're just sitting there,
quiet."</LD>
<TE>   Or better yet, they're getting up to leave.</TE>
<TE>   That's what the Toronto Raptors' fans decided to do with 3:16 left in
the fourth quarter Sunday, when only a timeout could delay the Lakers
from administering Toronto's worst home defeat of the season. Apparently
there were better things to do on this chilly, snowy day.</TE>
<TE>   "Sent 'em packing," Kobe Bryant said, with a huge grin.</TE>
<TE>   That's the goal for the Lakers this week. Put up and make them shut
up. Show 'em what you've got.</TE>
<TE>   They've been gearing toward this for two months now. Five games in
five cities in seven days. Their first real test against the combined
forces of air travel, bus rides, multiple hotel rooms and thousands of
people screaming "Beat L.A."</TE>
<TE>   Even in November, when it was all good, when they were on their way to
a 16-1 start and the talk was of 73-9, not Shaquille O'Neal's toes and
Bryant's ribs, Laker Coach Phil Jackson withheld judgment on this team.</TE>
<TE>   "We still haven't hit the road," Jackson said.</TE>
<TE>   That's the NBA's SAT. Only seven teams have a winning record on the
road. Of them, San Antonio (9-4) has the best winning percentage,
followed by the Lakers at 8-4.</TE>
<TE>   But, before Sunday, the Lakers had played only 11 games away from
Staples Center, and never more than two in a row.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a big trip for us," Bryant said before the game. "This is a
huge trip. San Antonio is right on our behind. We had a bad month of
December. We're really looking forward to this road trip."</TE>
<TE>   Bryant puts importance on every game--every practice even. He talks
much trash during intrasquad scrimmages and plays with heart every time
out.</TE>
<TE>   More and more, this team is taking on Bryant's character. If O'Neal
gives them the confidence that they can do anything because he has their
backs, Bryant adds a strut to their steps and infuses them with a will to
win.</TE>
<TE>   "Every game is so big," Bryant said. "Every single game. We \o7
hate\f7  losing. We really, really do. We really, really hate losing.
It's a team thing."</TE>
<TE>   "When you go [16-1], you kind of get spoiled. Then, when you lose a
game, you're like, 'What the ... ? This ain't supposed to happen. We hate
this stuff."'</TE>
<TE>   And so the Lakers did just enough to keep the Raptors within range
after Toronto's hot start, then they blitzed them.</TE>
<TE>   One of Jackson's tenets is that reserve players don't play as well on
the road. He thinks they depend more on the home crowd and also tend to
be shorted by the officials.</TE>
<TE>   That wasn't a problem Sunday. Horry, Devean George, Lindsey Hunter and
Mitch Richmond combined to score 12 points, and Bryant and O'Neal put up
20 to give the Lakers a six-point halftime lead.</TE>
<TE>   Maybe that Jackson rule doesn't apply to the Lakers because of some of
the people they have on their bench. Such as Horry, who has won four
championship rings and carries this philosophy about road games: "No
pressure."</TE>
<TE>   "You always want to perform well in front of your fans," he said.
"That's the way I always felt. There's more pressure to play in front of
your own instead of on the road. On the road, the only thing you have to
deal with is yourself and your teammates."</TE>
<TE>   And now they have Richmond, who has had limited action this season but
played 13 minutes Sunday. He made a three-point shot in the second
quarter, when the Lakers scored 14 in a row to take the lead.</TE>
<TE>   He is a former all-star and knows what it takes to win on the road.</TE>
<TE>   "Really running your stuff and running your offense," Richmond said.
"More so than anything, you've got to be poised and you've got to play
defense. It's really difficult to play defense in somebody else's house."</TE>
<TE>   Here's another idea: Get the ball to Bryant. He scored 12 of the
Lakers' final 14 points of the third quarter, including 10 in a row after
O'Neal left the game. Nothing wild, nothing forced, just the player on
the court finding numerous ways to score.</TE>
<TE>   With the big lead, Bryant spent the fourth quarter on the bench. A
three-pointer by Richmond that gave the Lakers a 21-point lead made sure
he stayed there.</TE>
<TE>   Then came the timeout, and the mass exodus from Air Canada Centre.</TE>
<TE>   "We just have to become consistent at doing that," O'Neal said.
"Sometimes we win by 20, sometimes we win by two. However, a win is a
win."</TE>
<TE>   Only some wins matter more than others. It's like real estate:
location, location, location.</TE>
<TE>   Not only are the Raptors one of the better teams the Lakers will face
this week, but it was an afternoon start after traveling across the
continent.</TE>
<TE>   "This is the worst in the league, when you go from the West Coast, all
the way to the East," Derek Fisher said. "Especially playing in the early
game, your body's really thrown off. It really takes a couple of days to
get adjusted.</TE>
<TE>   "When you handily beat a team the way we did, from the second quarter
on, these are the types of wins you can really build on. Hopefully, this
is a great start to a great trip."</TE>

<LD>The Clippers were 3-1 during last week's stretch of four games in
five nights. They get a chance to do it again this week, starting tonight
at Philadelphia.</LD>
<LD>  Then it's off to Washington to face Michael Jordan on Tuesday. They're
at New Jersey on Thursday and at Charlotte on Friday. The trip ends with
games Sunday at Toronto and Jan. 15 at Minnesota.</LD>
<LD>  All of which made the Clippers' victories Friday against Denver and
Saturday against Milwaukee so important.</LD>
<TE>  "It was big," Lamar Odom said, referring specifically to the Clippers'
86-83 victory over the Bucks. "We needed that win and we got it. Now it's
time to focus and get ready for the 10-day road trip."</TE>
<TE>  The Clippers have been homebodies so far. They haven't been away from
Staples Center for more than two games in a row since the season began.
Plus, they are 2-8 on the road.</TE>
<TE>  A couple of days ago, Elton Brand called this trip a "put-up-or-shut-up
trip."</TE>

Saturday to the Portland Trail Blazers. They were 3-4 on the trip, which
included a victory Dec. 26 against the Clippers. The Trail Blazers held
Allen Iverson to 18 points, 10 below his league-leading average. It also
was the first time in 13 games that Iverson failed to lead Philadelphia

<HD>O'Neal Deals With Extra Weight</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Tim Brown</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>TORONTO</DL>
<LD>Shaquille O'Neal weighs 341 pounds and carries 16.3% body fat, he
said Sunday.</LD>
<LD>   While he refused to concede that his feet would be more sound if he
were lighter, O'Neal recently returned to daily weightlifting and a
cardiovascular program that he believes could extend his career, or at
least get him to the end of his contract.</LD>
<LD>   He scored 24 points in his second game back from the injured list, a
20-point win against the Toronto Raptors, then soaked his aching feet in
a tub of milk and ice. The milk relieves the burning brought by
capsaicin, a cream that contains chili peppers. O'Neal has it rubbed on
his feet before each game. He has been lively in two games back, in part
because he feels better, and also because he has no choice but to play
through the remaining discomfort.</LD>
<TE>   "It's a little bit of both," he said. "Plus, my uncle Jerome
[Crawford] told me four years ago, 'When you get older, you have to work
harder.' I didn't believe him then. Now I do."</TE>
<TE>   O'Neal will be 30 in March. His contract, which he occasionally hints
he will not finish, is through 2005-06. He'll earn $32.4 million in that
final season, and he swears he'll walk away if something keeps him from
performing at his best.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not really affecting my play right now," he said of his toes. "I
don't think about it."</TE>
<TE>   O'Neal played 38 minutes and has 66 minutes in his past two games.</TE>
<TE>   "He's really dedicated to losing that weight that would help that
situation out," Coach Phil Jackson said. "One of the things we do know is
that the less weight that's on that foot, the better off he'll be."</TE>
<TE>   Asked how much O'Neal could lose, Jackson smiled.</TE>
<TE>   "About a hundred ... " he said.</TE>
<TE>   And laughed.</TE>

<HD>OK, Last One Out of the Silverdome, Light the Fuse</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Pontiac Silverdome, after 27 seasons as the ugly duckling of
NFL stadiums, was given a sendoff Sunday that it didn't deserve--a
Detroit Lion victory.</LD>
<LD>   The Silverdome represented just about everything that was wrong with
domed stadiums constructed in the 1960s and 1970s.</LD>
<LD>   A concrete jungle with steel cable jutting everywhere. An inflated
white-and-gray roof made of a fiberglass fabric that looked like a giant
spider web from the inside and the world's largest pot holder from the
outside. A playing surface with a rug better suited for Romper Room than
the NFL. Acres and acres of parking lot that Cal Worthington or Red
McCombs couldn't come close to filling.</LD>
<TE>   Fittingly, the Lions never won an NFL championship during their
Silverdome era. Unfortunately, one of its finest moments--Barry Sanders
eclipsing the 2,000-yard rushing mark in the 1997 season finale--was
marred by the frightening neck injury suffered by linebacker Reggie Brown
that ended his promising career.</TE>
<TE>   There didn't appear to be a wet eye among the 77,512 in attendance
after Detroit's 15-10 victory over the Dallas Cowboys--also the Lions'
opponent for the first regular-season game at the Silverdome in 1975. The
closest thing to a sentimental journey was Lion players mulling around
the perimeter of the stands to exchange congratulations with a handful of
not-so-teary-eyed fans for about 10 minutes.The scene was in direct
contrast to when Detroit Tiger fans openly wept at the last game at the
decaying but beloved Tiger Stadium--the previous home of the Lions.</TE>
<TE>   They return to downtown Detroit next season to play in Ford Field, a
new $315-million indoor stadium that will be the site of the 2006 Super
Bowl.</TE>
<TE>   "The Silverdome is a dump, it has no charisma," Lion fan Mike Naert
told the Associated Press. "I'm excited about the new stadium because it
brings new hope--we need it."</TE>
<TE>   The Lions will also have a $40-million practice facility in Allen
Park, about 10 miles from the new stadium. Among the many problems they
encountered during a 2-14 season that started with 12 consecutive losses
was getting barred from practicing in the Silverdome for several weeks
because of a dispute over the lease.</TE>
<TE>   The Lions ensured their escape from Silver Mausoleum by paying $27.2
million to get out of their lease four years early.</TE>
<TE>   So the Silverdome will now have to be content with its claim as "The
World's Largest Indoor In-line Skating Rink" and the site of Elvis
Presley's last stadium concert.</TE>
<TE>   The Lions have left the building.</TE>
<TE>When It Was Sims City</TE>
<TE>   The biggest roar from Lion fans in the Silverdome finale came with
5:47 left when Johnnie Morton scored what would be the stadium's final
NFL touchdown on a 16-yard pass from Ty Detmer, dropped to the turf and
undulated his body with a dance called "The Centipede."</TE>
<TE>   This brought back memories of the Lions' master showman, running back
Billy Sims, who played for Detroit from 1980-84.</TE>
<TE>   Among his routines: a goose-step strut in pregame introductions and
the "Simbo Glide" in which he would swoop across the goal line with both
arms.</TE>
<TE>   There would be no role in "Jurassic Park" for Sims, however.</TE>
<TE>Final Trip Down Memory Lane</TE>
<TE>   Some heartfelt Silverdome remembrances of Curt Sylvester of the
Detroit Free Press:</TE>
<TE>   * How the Silverdome seems like it's out in the middle of nowhere.
Especially when you're walking from your parking place.</TE>

<TE>A Re-Marc-able Turn of Events</TE>
<TE>   The Cleveland Browns, four seasons into their return to the NFL, made
a commitment to the future Friday by giving quarterback Tim Couch an
$8.7-million bonus and exercising their option for the remaining four
years on his contract rather than allow him to become a restricted free
agent.</TE>
<TE>   "Now is the time to make the move. Everyone was in total agreement.
Not only is he our quarterback of the present. He is our quarterback of
the future," team President Carmen Policy said.</TE>
<TE>   The decision less than a week after Couch had one of the best games of
his three-year career, a 41-38 come-from-behind victory over Tennessee.
Couch, the first pick in the 1999 draft, passed for career highs of 336
yards and three touchdowns.</TE>
<TE>   Now, flash back to Oct. 23, 1983. The Raiders replace a struggling
Super Bowl XV hero Jim Plunkett with promising Brigham Young product Marc
Wilson for a nationally televised game Sunday night against the unbeaten
Dallas Cowboys at Texas Stadium. On this night, Wilson is America's
Quarterback, completing 26 of 49 passes for a career high 318 yards and
three touchdowns to lead the Raiders to a wild 40-38 victory. Afterward,
it is learned that on Friday, the Raiders had signed Wilson to a
then-staggering $4 million over five seasons.</TE>
<TE>   Why the sudden urgency to break the bank for a young quarterback who
for all of his potential had completed only 47% of his passes and had
more interceptions than touchdowns in spot duty over three seasons?</TE>
<TE>   Well, it seems the New Jersey Generals of the fledgling USFL were
making serious overtures to Wilson's agent. It had became a case of use
him or lose him, as Wilson was in his option year. The Raiders made the
contractual commitment, but wouldn't be led to excellence by Wilson, who
was injured later in the season--leaving it to the venerable Plunkett to
lead the Raiders to another Super Bowl championship.</TE>
<TE>   Wilson would be the main man over the next four seasons, but the
Raiders would never return to Super Bowl heights and slid to a 5-10
record in 1987. By 1988, Wilson was an ex-Raider.</TE>
<TE>   "Clearly he is the future of this franchise. He is the kind of guy you
want to build a team around."</TE>
<TE>   That was Cleveland Coach Butch Davis talking about Couch Friday.</TE>
<TE>   On a snowy Sunday in Pittsburgh, Couch completed 13 of 26 passes for
150 yards with no touchdowns and two interceptions in a 28-7 loss.</TE>
<TE>   It's a cold, cruel NFL world.</TE>

<LD>Minnesota (5-10) at Baltimore (9-6) 6 p.m., channel 7</LD>
<LD>   The line: Baltimore by 121/2</LD>
<LD>   Story line: Add it up; Korey Stringer's death, Randy Moss's immature
antics, Cris Carter's mutiny, Dennis Green's firing, the departure of
five Pro Bowl players in two years, this Viking season has played out
like a Greek tragedy. Baltimore hasn't had an easy time of it either,
having to overcome numerous crippling injuries while in defense of their
Super Bowl title. The Ravens need to win tonight to make the playoffs.</LD>
<TE>    Keys to the game: With third stringer Spergon Wynn getting the start
at quarterback, Minnesota's passing options are limited. Wynn should
spread out the secondary by going deep to Moss, putting Carter in single
coverage along the sideline where he can move the chains. Rookie running
back Michael Bennett could take some of the pressure off Wynn with
another 100-yard performance like the one he had against Green Bay last
Sunday. A large part of Baltimore's offense lies in the hands of a couple
of ex-Vikings, Terry Allen and Qadry Ismail. Allen should have little
trouble rushing against Minnesota's undersized front seven. Elvis Grbac
should concentrate on getting Shannon Sharpe the ball over the middle,
putting Minnesota's cornerbacks on an island against Ismail and Travis
Taylor.</TE>
<TE>   The pick: Baltimore. While the Vikings haven't played with any pride
in weeks, interim coach Mike Tice might inspire them to at least show up
for this game. The Vikings have lost 10 consecutive road games dating
back to a victory at Dallas on Thanksgiving last season.</TE>

<HD>Bears Win Central</HD>

<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>CHICAGO</DL>
<LD>Keith Traylor was huffing and puffing, his 300-pound-plus body
chugging down the field with an interception, his eyes studying where to
go and what to do next.</LD>
<LD>   Traylor ran out of steam before scoring Sunday, but the Chicago Bears
had more than enough energy to capture their first NFC Central title
since 1990.</LD>
<LD>   The Bears (13-3) intercepted three passes and sacked Mark Brunell four
times, and Anthony Thomas rushed for 160 yards as Chicago beat the
Jacksonville Jaguars, 33-13, to clinch the division.</LD>
<TE>   Traylor's lumbering 67-yard, highlight-film return set up a touchdown
that put the Bears up, 20-0, in the third quarter.</TE>
<TE>   "I just followed the ball. When it landed, I said, 'Oh I got it. What
should I do now?"' said Traylor, a defensive tackle who played in two
Super Bowls with Denver before signing in the off-season with the Bears.</TE>
<TE>   "The ball landed in my hands and I just got as far as I could. I was
looking for someone to pitch it to, but no one showed up. I did the best
I could. I was trying to get there, but they got me."</TE>
<TE>   The Bears, 5-11 a year ago, will get a week off and then host a
playoff game Jan. 19 or Jan. 20.</TE>
<TE>   "Oh, wow, it's hard to even explain," quarterback Jim Miller said
outside a jubilant locker room. "It's been a long ride to get to this
point. Guys are ecstatic."</TE>
<TE>   Trailing 13-0, Jacksonville's Paul Spicer recovered Miller's fumble
after a sack by Marlon McCree. Threatening to get back in the game after
a Brunell-to-Keenan McCardell 16-yard pass put the ball on Chicago's 20,
the Jaguars (6-10) were quickly turned away by the mammoth Traylor.</TE>
<TE>   He reached up and swatted Brunell's next pass into the air, tipped it
again, grabbed it and took off. Two plays later, Miller connected with
David Terrell with a nine-yard pass to make it 20-0.</TE>

<KH>DETROIT 15, DALLAS 10</KH>
<HD>Lions Discover a Silver Lining</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>PONTIAC, Mich.</DL>
<LD>Personal accomplishments always seemed to overshadow the Detroit
Lions' lack of success at the Silverdome.</LD>
<LD>   The final game there was no different.</LD>
<LD>   Emmitt Smith became the first running back to reach 1,000 yards in 11
consecutive seasons--breaking a record he shared with former Detroit star
Barry Sanders--but the Lions beat Smith and the Dallas Cowboys, 15-10,
Sunday to avoid a 15-loss season.</LD>
<TE>   Ty Detmer threw a 16-yard touchdown pass to Johnnie Morton with 5:37
left for the game-winner, and Detroit stopped Dallas' last two series to
earn a consolation victory in a miserable 2-14 season.</TE>
<TE>   Smith broke the record on a 13-yard run in his 13th carry late in the
third quarter.</TE>
<TE>   "It's very sour," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Smith ran for 77 yards and a touchdown in 18 carries to finish his
season with 1,021 and increase his career total to 16,187, 539 behind
Walter Payton's 16,726.</TE>
<TE>   "That's a long way to go," Smith said. "You just don't know how hard
it is to get 100 yards in a game."</TE>
<TE>   The Lions and their fans know how difficult it is to earn a playoff
win because Detroit has only one--over the Cowboys in 1992--since winning
the 1957 championship.</TE>
<TE>   After playing 30 miles north of Detroit for 27 years, the Lions will
return downtown next season to play at Ford Field, a new $315-million
indoor stadium that will play host to the 2006 Super Bowl.</TE>
<TE>   The Lions matched the worst mark in franchise history, and Dallas
(5-11) finished with the same record for the second straight year.</TE>
<TE>   Still, after starting the season with 12 consecutive losses, the Lions
are happy just to blend in among the worst teams in NFL history instead
of being the first 0-16 team or joining Carolina at 1-15.</TE>
<TE>   "We pulled out two wins at the end of the year that no one else in the
league cares about," Detroit kicker Jason Hanson said. "But they were
nice wins."</TE>

<KH>GREEN BAY 34, NEW YORK GIANTS 25</KH>
<HD>Victory Gives Packers Home-Ice Advantage</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J.</DL>
<LD>The Green Bay Packers got just what they wanted Sunday--the right
to open the playoffs next week against San Francisco at frigid Lambeau
Field.</LD>
<LD>   The Packers' 34-25 victory over the New York Giants, whose Michael
Strahan broke the single-season sacks record, assured Green Bay a
first-round home game against the 49ers.</LD>
<LD>   "This is a big advantage for us, but we don't think they are going to
come in and bow down," safety Darren Sharper said. "They have the same
record as us, so they are just as good a team as us. But the fact we are
playing at home might put some things in their minds."</LD>
<TE>   The one thing the 49ers have to know is that the Packers (12-4) have
never lost a playoff game at Lambeau Field, where they were 7-1 in the
regular season.</TE>
<TE>   The Packers also are playing well, having won their last three and six
of seven.</TE>
<TE>   The only thing they gave away against the Giants was Strahan's record.</TE>
<TE>   Brett Favre changed a play at the line of scrimmage with less than
three minutes to play and was sacked on a rollout, giving Strahan 221/2
sacks for the season.</TE>
<TE>   "Guys were upset that he was able to get the sack," Packer receiver
Antonio Freeman said. "I was telling them if there is anyone in the NFL
that deserves it, it's him."</TE>
<TE>   Before he fell down on the sack, Favre threw two touchdown passes and
Ahman Green scored on runs of 25 yards and one yard.</TE>
<TE>   The loss ended a season in which New York (7-9) missed the playoffs
one year after playing in the Super Bowl. The only bright spot was
Strahan breaking Mark Gastineau's record of 22 sacks with 2:42 to play.</TE>
<TE>   The only thing that prevented the Packers from having a perfect day
was the Bears. Chicago (13-3) won the NFC Central by defeating
Jacksonville, 33-13.</TE>
<TE>   Had the Bears lost, the Packers would have won the division and gotten
an extra week off with their win. Instead, they'll play the 49ers.</TE>
<TE>   "Home field is big," Packer center Mike Flanagan said. "They have to
come to our place, to cold weather and our fans."</TE>
<TE>   The Packers needed only seven plays to score touchdowns on their first
two possessions.</TE>
<TE>   Favre, who completed 15 of 30 passes for 315 yards, connected with
Bill Schroeder for a 26-yard touchdown on the Packers' fourth play.
Sharper's interception got the ball back, and Green (23 carries, 101

<KH>PHILADELPHIA 17, TAMPA BAY 13</KH>
<HD>Preview Game Goes to Eagles</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>TAMPA, Fla.</DL>
<LD>The Philadelphia Eagles and Tampa Bay Buccaneers will get to see
who wins when it really matters.</LD>
<LD>   The first-round playoff opponents closed the regular season against
each other Sunday night, with the Eagles coming from behind to win,
17-13, as both teams rested most of their starters.</LD>
<LD>   Third-stringer A.J. Feeley threw two touchdown passes to Dameane
Douglas in a 26-second span of the fourth quarter to bring Philadelphia
back from a 13-3 deficit.</LD>
<TE>   The Eagles (11-5) and Buccaneers (9-7) will meet again Saturday in a
rematch of the NFC wild-card game that the Eagles won, 21-3, in
Philadelphia last season.</TE>
<TE>   "We have something to prove to ourselves," Buccaneer cornerback Ronde
Barber said. "We went up there and got embarrassed last year. That's the
bottom line. We didn't get it done."</TE>
<TE>   Feeley threw a two-yard touchdown pass to Douglas with 2:12 remaining,
and Rashard Cook recovered Karl Williams' fumble at the Tampa Bay 24 on
the ensuing kickoff.</TE>
<TE>   Two plays later, Douglas scored again on a 24-yard play.</TE>
<TE>   "Everybody was talking about this being a meaningless game, but it
wasn't meaningless for the guys who played," Eagle safety Brian Dawkins
said. "They practice every day.... It was great to let them have a chance
to show what they can do."</TE>
<TE>   Tampa Bay marched into Philadelphia territory in the final 1:46, but
Shaun King's desperation pass fell incomplete short of the end zone as
time expired.</TE>
<TE>   "When you're a winner, it doesn't matter what you're doing. You could
be playing marbles, Nintendo, whatever--you want to win," Buccaneer
defensive end Steve White said.</TE>
<TE>   Aaron Stecker scored on a four-yard run and Doug Brien kicked field
goals of 42 and 23 yards for the Buccaneers, who won five of their
previous six to grab the final NFC wild-card spot.</TE>
<TE>   With playoff seedings and next week's NFC matchups already determined,
neither team had anything to gain by playing their starters in the
nationally televised game.</TE>
<TE>   The Eagles clinched their first NFC East title since 1988 last week
and approached the finale the way teams normally treat the preseason.
Donovan McNabb appeared for two plays, and Feeley was on the field by the
end.</TE>
<TE>   McNabb trotted off after handing off twice to Correll Buckhalter and
was replaced by Koy Detmer, who was five for 14 for 51 yards with one
interception. Brad Johnson started at quarterback for Tampa Bay and
played one series.</TE>

<KH>SAN FRANCISCO 38, NEW ORLEANS 0</KH>
<HD>49ers Warm to the Task</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>NEW ORLEANS</DL>
<LD>Maybe frigid Lambeau Field can cool off Jeff Garcia.</LD>
<LD>   Garcia warmed up for his playoff visit to Green Bay by throwing four
touchdown passes for the second time this season against New Orleans,
leading the San Francisco 49ers to a 38-0 victory over the Saints on
Sunday.</LD>
<LD>   "It got to a point where we basically were able to do what we wanted,"
Garcia said.</LD>
<TE>   Garcia, who came out after one series in the fourth quarter, completed
14 of 21 passes for 263 yards.</TE>
<TE>   San Francisco (12-4), which recorded its third shutout in the last six
games, had a chance to get a home game in the first round of the playoffs
until a 27-21 upset loss to the Dallas Cowboys last Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   Green Bay's 34-25 victory over the New York Giants meant that the
49ers will play next weekend at Lambeau Field, where the Packers have
never lost a playoff game.</TE>
<TE>   "Hey, I grew up in the cold," said San Francisco Coach Steve Mariucci,
a Michigan native. "It doesn't bother me a bit. We don't care where we
play or when we play."</TE>
<TE>   The Saints (7-9) finished the season with four straight losses and
gave up an average of 40 points in those games.</TE>
<TE>   "Any time you lose the last four straight, it's a humbling
experience," Coach Jim Haslett said.</TE>
<TE>   Aaron Brooks had four passes intercepted and was sacked three times as
New Orleans, the 2000 NFC West champion, was shut out for the first time
since the 49ers beat the Saints, 31-0, in 1998.</TE>
<TE>   After struggling on their first two possessions, the 49ers took
advantage of a fumble by Ricky Williams at the San Francisco 44. On first
down, Garcia found Terrell Owens 10 yards behind Saint cornerback Fred
Thomas for a 56-yard touchdown and a 7-0 lead.</TE>
<TE>   On the 49ers' next possession, Garcia found Owens again for a 60-yard
touchdown that made it 14-0. The two touchdowns were Owens' only
receptions of the day.</TE>
<TE>   "Jeff was just being Jeff," Owens said. "He ran when he had to, he
threw when he had to. He got it going."</TE>
<TE>   In the second quarter, the 49ers recovered Williams' second fumble, on
the Saint 28, setting up Garcia's third touchdown pass, a six-yarder to
Terry Jackson that put San Francisco ahead, 21-0.</TE>
<TE>   Midway through the third quarter, the 49ers' third interception of
Brooks led to a 39-yard field goal that made it 24-0</TE>
<TE>   Garcia threw his fourth touchdown pass on the first play of the fourth
quarter, hitting J.J. Stokes for a six-yard score that made it 31-0.</TE>
<TE>   "I connected with Terrell on some deep balls where he blew by some
guys," Garcia said. "I hit J.J. a couple of times on the sidelines. We
tried to open it up a little bit."</TE>

<KH>WASHINGTON 20, ARIZONA 17</KH>
<HD>Now, Redskins Await a Direction Finder</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>LANDOVER, Md.</DL>
<LD>His voice trembling with emotion, Marty Schottenheimer admitted he
misplayed the expectations game.</LD>
<LD>   The Washington Redskins finished an 8-8 season Sunday with a 20-17
victory over the Arizona Cardinals. A .500 finish might seem impressive
considering the Redskins' 0-5 start, but it's a disappointment for a
coach who five months ago spoke of winning a Super Bowl in his first
season.</LD>
<LD>   "The one thing I regret about the whole deal is this," Schottenheimer
said. "I never go into a season, ever, with any goal less than to win the
world's championship. Maybe I created an added burden on our team."</LD>
<TE>   The Redskins also finished 8-8 after starting 0-5 in 1981 under
first-year Coach Joe Gibbs, who later won three Super Bowls. Yet Sunday's
game was played amid questions about the direction of the franchise, an
uncertainty that hit a new level when Florida Coach Steve Spurrier
resigned Friday and declared himself available for an NFL job.</TE>
<TE>   "It's tough," quarterback Tony Banks said. "We've had enough to worry
about around here, then a college coach basically upheaves every NFL team
that has a possibility of not going to the Super Bowl, like they're going
to get a new coach. That's a little difficult, but fortunately we weren't
the only team going through that."</TE>
<TE>   Things are more stable with the Cardinals (7-9), who started 2-6 in
Coach Dave McGinnis' first full season and couldn't prevent their 15th
losing season in 17 years.</TE>
<TE>   In rainy weather before a half-empty stadium, Stephen Davis scored the
winning touchdown on a two-yard run with 3:11 to play. Davis carried a
career-high 38 times for 148 yards to finish with 1,432, topping the team
record of 1,405 he set two years ago.</TE>

<KH>INDIANAPOLIS 29, DENVER 10</KH>
<HD>Colts End Disappointing Season on a High Note</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>INDIANAPOLIS</DL>
<LD>The Indianapolis Colts gave their fans a glimpse of the team they
could have been this season.</LD>
<LD>   Peyton Manning threw for two touchdowns, Dominic Rhodes ran for 141
yards and the defense forced four turnovers and allowed a season-low
point total as the Colts closed out a disappointing season with a 29-10
victory over Denver.</LD>
<LD>   "I'm proud of the way our defense played," Coach Jim Mora said. "A
little luck is involved in this game, with tipped passes going into other
hands and things like that. Today some of that went our way."</LD>
<TE>   For Mora, it was an emotional day in what could have been his final
game as Indianapolis coach.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, Mora became the first Colt coach to win 10 games in
consecutive seasons since Ted Marchibroda in 1976-77, but this season
turned sour fast.</TE>
<TE>   Sunday's victory was only the second in the last nine games for the
Colts (6-10), who finished with their first losing season since
1998--Mora's first season in Indianapolis.</TE>
<TE>   It was only the third win at home for the Colts this season.</TE>
<TE>   "Am I emotional? Damn right I am," Mora said after wiping tears from
his eyes and punching the backdrop behind the podium.</TE>
<TE>   "I apologize. All through the season and at the end of the season,
there's a lot of stuff that goes on that people don't know about."</TE>
<TE>   Colt spokesman Craig Kelley said no news conference has been scheduled
for today.</TE>
<TE>   Mora wasn't the only person facing an uncertain future following
Sunday's finale.</TE>
<TE>   Former league and Super Bowl most valuable player Terrell Davis may
have played his final game in a Bronco uniform after rushing for 82 yards
in 18 carries. Although he ran more like he did in his prime, Davis'
salary-cap number next season may be too expensive for the Broncos (8-8).</TE>
<TE>   "I want to be here," Davis said. "Whatever I have to do to come to
terms for being here, I'll do."</TE>
<TE>   The Colts seemed to do everything right Sunday--for the first time all
season.</TE>
<TE>   Manning completed 16 of 30 passes for 191 yards, and Rhodes provided
the running threat that opened up the passing game, running for more than
100 yards for the fifth time this season.</TE>
<TE>   He finished with 1,104 yards, the first undrafted rookie to rush for
more than 1,000.</TE>
<TE>   Indianapolis, next to last in the NFL in defense, limited Denver to
219 yards in total offense, picked off four Brian Griese passes and
sacked Griese five times, playing without starting linebacker Rob Morris.</TE>
<TE>   (BEGIN TEXT OF INFOBOX / INFOGRAPHIC)</TE>
<TE>Paving His Own Rhodes</TE>
<TE>   With a 141-yard performance against Denver, Colt rookie running back
Dominic Rhodes became the first undrafted rookie to run for more than
1,000 yards. Taking over for injured starter Edgerrin James in week
seven, Rhodes had five 100-yard games and nine touchdowns in 10 starts.
Following is a list of the top five undrafted rookie rushers since 1970:</TE>

<KH>ST. LOUIS 31, ATLANTA 13</KH>
<HD>There's No Place Like Dome for Rams</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>ST. LOUIS</DL>
<LD>Marshall Faulk saw a potential disadvantage to becoming the first
player in NFL history with four consecutive 2,000-yard seasons: The man
he passed might not be pleased.</LD>
<LD>   Faulk had 226 yards rushing and receiving Sunday, helping the St.
Louis Rams lock up home-field advantage in the NFC playoffs with a 31-13
victory against the Atlanta Falcons, who finished 7-9.</LD>
<LD>   "If I see Jim Brown at a golf tournament, he'll probably cuss me out,"
Faulk said.</LD>
<TE>   Entering the game, only Faulk and Brown had compiled three consecutive
2,000-yard seasons from scrimmage. Faulk left Brown behind with a 21-yard
catch in the second quarter and finished with 168 yards in 20 carries and
four catches for 58 yards for a total of 2,147.</TE>
<TE>   "I go out there and I play as hard as I can and I try to make every
play work," Faulk said. "What I've done the last four years is a result
of it."</TE>
<TE>   Kurt Warner also reached a milestone, recording the second-highest
passing-yardage total ever. Ricky Proehl caught two of Warner's three
touchdown passes as the Rams (14-2) set a franchise record for victories.</TE>
<TE>   The NFC West champions, trying to reach the Super Bowl for the second
time in three years, have a first-round bye.</TE>
<TE>   Both of the Rams' regular-season losses came in the Dome at America's
Center, but they didn't want to slow down their high-flying attack with a
cold-weather playoff game. So Coach Mike Martz left his biggest stars in
almost the entire the game, removing Faulk with about five minutes to go
and allowing Warner to finish.</TE>
<TE>   The Rams, who also surpassed 500 points for the third consecutive
season, had to win to secure home-field advantage after Chicago defeated
Jacksonville, 33-13, earlier Sunday. They pulled away from a 17-6
halftime lead on a three-yard scoring run by Faulk and an eight-yard
touchdown pass from Warner to Proehl in the third quarter.</TE>
<TE>   Proehl stepped in after Isaac Bruce injured his lower back in the
first quarter and made a spectacular sliding grab on his 12-yard
touchdown catch in the first quarter.</TE>
<TE>   The St. Louis defense controlled rookie quarterback Michael Vick, who
was sacked seven times in his second career start. Vick replaced the
injured Chris Chandler.</TE>
<TE>   "We got him seven times and we should have had him about a dozen
times," defensive end Grant Wistrom said.</TE>
<TE>   Vick was hounded by blitzes all game and was 12 for 30 for 176 yards
with one interception.</TE>

<LD>The Pittsburgh Steelers did have something to play for in an
otherwise meaningless game--themselves.</LD>
<LD>  Troy Edwards scored on a 32-yard fumble return to start the second half
and the Steelers, wrapping up their best regular season in 23 years,
regained some pre-playoff momentum by beating the Cleveland Browns, 28-7,
Sunday.</LD>
<LD>  In a game that meant little to the Steelers except that it was against
their biggest rival, most starters played only a half, and some--Pro Bowl
picks Jerome Bettis and Alan Faneca among them--didn't play because of
injuries.</LD>
<TE>  But the Steelers (13-3), already guaranteed home-field advantage in the
AFC playoffs and a bye next weekend, clearly didn't want to go into the
postseason off consecutive losses to Cincinnati and Cleveland. And they
played that way, dominating the Browns (7-9) even with their reserves.</TE>
<TE>  Bettis' backups, Chris Fuamatu-Ma'afala and R.J. Bowers, each ran for a
touchdown behind an offensive line filled with backups. Backup
quarterback Tommy Maddox, who has played little since the XFL's one and
only season, connected with Bobby Shaw on a 40-yard scoring pass after
replacing Kordell Stewart in the second half.</TE>
<TE>  It was a major turnaround from the week before, when the Steelers'
league-leading defense yielded 544 yards in a 26-23 overtime loss at
Cincinnati.</TE>
<TE>  "We didn't want people talking about that for the next two weeks," wide
receiver Plaxico Burress said. "Now we can go into the playoffs on a high
note."</TE>
<TE>  And with one of the best records in team history. The Steelers won 13
games in the regular season for only the second time. They were 14-2 in
1978.</TE>
<TE>  "It's hard to win 13 games in this league," offensive tackle Wayne
Gandy said. "But that's the way this team was all season--all this team
needed was a challenge, somebody telling us we couldn't do something."</TE>

<KH>CINCINNATI 23, TENNESSEE 21</KH>
<HD>Sixth Victory Is Most for Bengals Since 1997</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>NASHVILLE, Tenn.</DL>
<LD>The Cincinnati Bengals insist they are learning from Coach Dick
LeBeau. Their next lesson? Playing as well during the middle of the
season as they do at the end.</LD>
<LD>   Neil Rackers kicked three field goals, including the game winner with
20 seconds left, as the Bengals defeated the Tennessee Titans, 23-21, for
their second consecutive victory and their most wins in a season since
1997.</LD>
<LD>   The Bengals (6-10) finished as they started, with a two-game winning
streak. But they preceded the closing spurt with a seven-game slide.</LD>
<TE>   It's their best finish since going 7-9 in 1997, and they also ended a
seven-game losing streak to the Titans (7-9).</TE>
<TE>   LeBeau called it a good ending as the Bengals beat the Pittsburgh
Steelers last week and overcame a 14-0 deficit against the Titans.</TE>
<TE>   "That's reflective of the character of this team," he said. "We need
to play a little bit better, but I think we can do that."</TE>
<TE>   Linebacker Takeo Spikes said he thinks leadership finally has replaced
the negative attitude that has permeated the Bengals in previous seasons.</TE>
<TE>   "That comes from the top with Coach LeBeau," he said. "He taught
principles all year long. That is basically what it comes down to--what
he teaches and what he believes in. Everybody believes in him, and once
you have everyone believing in our head coach like that, then it just
filters down to everyone else."</TE>
<TE>   The Titans blew a 14-point lead for the second consecutive week as
they finished with their first losing record since Coach Jeff Fisher's
first full season in 1995.</TE>

<KH>MIAMI 34, BUFFALO 7</KH>
<HD>Dolphins Will Work From Home</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>MIAMI</DL>
<LD>The Miami Dolphins claim to have no preference regarding their
first-round playoff opponent. Too bad playing Buffalo again is out of the
question.</LD>
<LD>   Lamar Smith rushed for 158 yards and a touchdown Sunday to help the
Dolphins clinch a home game in the opening round by beating the lowly
Bills, 34-7.</LD>
<LD>   The game began shortly after New England won the AFC East by drubbing
Carolina, 38-6, which dashed the Dolphins' hopes of winning the division
and earning a first-round bye.</LD>
<TE>   Miami (11-5), which clinched a playoff berth a week ago, will host
Baltimore or the New York Jets in the opening round Sunday. The Ravens
will be the opponent if they win tonight at Minnesota; if they lose or
tie, New York will play at Miami.</TE>
<TE>   "It doesn't matter," quarterback Jay Fiedler said. "We've got to beat
everyone to get where we want to go anyway."</TE>
<TE>   But the Jets have beaten the Dolphins eight consecutive times,
including twice this season.</TE>
<TE>   "They might come in here with a little swagger," Miami defensive end
Lorenzo Bromell admitted.</TE>
<TE>   The Bills (3-13), out of the playoff race since October, finished with
their worst record since going 2-14 in 1985.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think you can look back on the season and pick out a lot of
good things," said quarterback Alex Van Pelt, who was sidelined by a
sprained throwing shoulder in the first quarter.</TE>
<TE>   The Dolphins are happy to start the playoffs at home, where they're
7-1 this season, outscoring opponents, 188-92. Their last six playoff
losses have been on the road.</TE>
<TE>   "Whoever we play, we get them here," tight end Hunter Goodwin said.
"We seem to play a lot better in our house."</TE>
<TE>   Miami will need to heal fast. Defensive end Jason Taylor (sprained
left shoulder) and standout rookie receiver Chris Chambers (sprained
right ankle) became the latest casualties Sunday, and Pro Bowl middle
linebacker Zach Thomas (torn right shoulder muscle) sat out the game.</TE>
<TE>   The Dolphins can only hope Smith has rediscovered his form of last
season. He came into the game averaging 2.9 yards per carry and, with 30
carries, topped 100 yards for only the third time.</TE>
<TE>   While Miami's offense sputtered, repeatedly squandering scoring
chances, the defense allowed only 13 yards in the first half and scored
on the final play of the game when Brock Marion returned an interception
100 yards.</TE>
<TE>   The Dolphins sidelined the opposing quarterback for the second week in
a row. Van Pelt's replacement, Travis Brown, who had never completed a
pass in the NFL, finished 15 for 33 for 201 yards with two interceptions.</TE>

<KH>NEW ENGLAND 38, CAROLINA 6</KH>
<HD>Reports: Panthers to Fire Seifert</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>CHARLOTTE, N.C.</DL>
<LD>As the New England Patriots danced their way off the field in
celebration of winning the AFC East title, the Carolina Panthers hung
their heads, embarrassed by their 15th consecutive defeat.</LD>
<LD>   Their coach, George Seifert, showed no emotion as he walked off
probably for the final time with the Panthers. Carolina's 38-6 loss to
the Patriots on Sunday is not the final memory Seifert wants from his
tenure, but it's likely out of his hands.</LD>
<LD>   "I plan on coaching this team next year, absolutely," said Seifert,
who has two years left on his contract. "I don't plan on resigning the
job."</LD>
<TE>   But speculation has begun that he'll be fired, with Steve Spurrier's
name buzzing around Charlotte since his resignation as coach at Florida
on Friday. Panther owner Jerry Richardson declined comment, but he and
Seifert are scheduled to meet this morning.</TE>
<TE>   The Charlotte Observer posted on its Web site, citing an unidentified
source, that Seifert would be forced out today.</TE>
<TE>   http://CBSsportsline.com, meanwhile, reported that Seifert would be
fired.</TE>
<TE>   That's what happens when a rebuilding effort goes terribly awry, as it
did with the Panthers, the first team in NFL history to lose 15
consecutive games in a season.</TE>
<TE>   "It's very depressing to be part of this dubious record," cornerback
Jimmy Hitchcock said. "George's future hasn't crossed my mind, honestly,
because the only thing I can think about is that we just lost 15
straight."</TE>
<TE>   In doing so, they helped the Patriots continue their surprising
turnaround. New England (11-5) rolled to its sixth consecutive victory
while winning its first division title since 1997.</TE>
<TE>   "We worked so hard after winning five games last year and being
written off early this year," safety Lawyer Milloy said. "We were in the
same boat that the Panthers are in today, going home early, and it's a
sickening feeling. We put in a lot of hard work to turn it around, and
hard work pays off."</TE>
<TE>   The win came with plenty of help from the Panthers, who went out in
the same hapless fashion they played all season--committing six
turnovers, two for scores.</TE>
<TE>   And they did so in near privacy. The announced crowd was 21,070, less
than half the previous franchise low. Adding insult to Carolina (1-15)
were the huge sections of Patriot fans waving red and blue and raucously
celebrating every New England score.</TE>
<TE>   The Patriots struck early and didn't stop, using all their resources
to assure wrapping up the division title without having to wait for later
games.</TE>
<TE>   Ty Law returned Chris Weinke's first interception 46 yards for a
touchdown and Otis Smith returned Weinke's third interception 76 yards
for another score. Troy Brown ran back a punt 68 yards for a touchdown
and Antowain Smith had a 32-yard touchdown run.</TE>
<TE>   Richard Huntley set a Panther record with 168 yards rushing.</TE>

<HD>Seahawks Must Wait to Learn Fate</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>SEATTLE</DL>
<LD>The Seattle Seahawks need the help of the Minnesota Vikings to get
into the playoffs.</LD>
<LD>   Trent Dilfer passed for two touchdowns and Shaun Alexander scored on a
44-yard run as the Seahawks scored a 21-18 victory against the Kansas
City Chiefs on Sunday.</LD>
<LD>   Seattle gets into the playoffs as an AFC wild-card team tonight if the
Baltimore Ravens lose at home to the Vikings.</LD>
<TE>   Mike Tice, a tight end for the Seahawks from 1981-88 and 1990-91, is
the interim coach of the Vikings.</TE>
<TE>   "Hopefully, Randy Moss will go crazy tomorrow night and catch about
five touchdowns and we'll be in," said Dilfer, who quarterbacked the
Ravens to their Super Bowl victory last season.</TE>
<TE>   The Seahawks (9-7) would have made the postseason if the Oakland
Raiders had beaten the Jets, but New York won, 24-22, to clinch a spot.</TE>
<TE>   Seattle Coach Mike Holmgren sounded more realistic about Minnesota's
chances of winning in Baltimore.</TE>
<TE>   "They've got their hands full," Holmgren said. "They're going to play
hard, but the trouble is they're playing a real fine team in Baltimore."</TE>
<TE>   Dilfer, replacing the injured Matt Hasselbeck at quarterback for the
second consecutive week, had touchdown passes of 12 and 18 yards to
Darrell Jackson in the second quarter for a 14-0 lead at halftime.</TE>
<TE>   It was Dilfer's 15th consecutive victory as a starter, including 4-0
this season, when he mainly was Hasselbeck's backup. He hasn't lost a
start since October 2000.</TE>
<TE>   "We did what we had to do today and we should be proud of that,"
Dilfer said. "We played a really fine game. We can't control what happens
tomorrow night. We can't beat ourselves up thinking about what could have
been earlier in the year."</TE>
<TE>   The Chiefs blocked a punt to set up a touchdown and then added a field
goal in the third quarter, making it 14-10. Alexander broke outside and
ran down the right sideline on his 44-yard touchdown, his 16th touchdown
of the season.</TE>
<TE>   Kansas City's Priest Holmes won the NFL rushing title with 1,555
yards, finishing ahead of Curtis Martin of the Jets, who had 1,505 yards.
Holmes had 117 yards in 23 carries, breaking the franchise mark of 1,480
set by Christian Okoye in 1989.</TE>
<TE>   "It means a lot," said Holmes, signed by the Chiefs as a free agent in
April after playing four seasons in Baltimore. "I think whenever you have
an opportunity to have something, it's worth grabbing."</TE>
<TE>   Kansas City (6-10) scored a touchdown in the final minute on a short
run by Tony Richardson and got a two-point conversion on a pass from
Trent Green to Eddie Kennison.</TE>
<TE>   The Chiefs' onside kick was recovered by Bobby Engram of the Seahawks.</TE>
<TE>   Alexander, who had his right ankle X-rayed after his first carry of
the game, finished with 127 yards in 20 carries. It was Alexander's
fourth 100-yard rushing game in 12 starts filling in for the injured
Ricky Watters.</TE>
<TE>   Dilfer, signed to a one-year contract as a free agent in August,
completed 22 of 38 passes for 248 yards, with two touchdowns and two
interceptions.</TE>
<TE>   Dilfer passed for five touchdowns in Seattle's last two games, four to
Jackson.</TE>
<TE>   Trent Green of the Chiefs was 15 of 33 for 184 yards and one
touchdown, with one interception.</TE>
<TE>   (BEGIN TEXT OF INFOBOX / INFOGRAPHIC)</TE>
<TE>He Just Wins, Baby</TE>
<TE>  Seattle's 21-18 victory against the Chiefs was Trent Dilfer's 15th
consecutive win as a starter, which prompts the question: why wasn't
Dilfer named the starter much earlier this season? Mike Holmgren's
loyalty to Matt Hasselbeck may have cost the Seahawks a playoff berth
should the Ravens defeat the Vikings tonight. Below is a look at how
Hasselbeck and Dilfer have fared as starters this season.</TE>

<LD>UCLA can't spend much time in the glow of two victories each over
Washington and Washington State to begin Pacific 10 Conference play.</LD>
<LD>   The schedule quickly becomes rigorous.</LD>
<LD>   After facing USC at the Forum on Thursday, the Bruins (11-2 overall)
play host to No. 2 Kansas Saturday in a nonconference game.</LD>
<TE>   After that comes a trip to Arizona State and Arizona, followed by home
games against No. 12 Stanford and California.</TE>
<TE>   Then UCLA must visit Oregon, which has defeated Arizona twice.</TE>
<TE>   Victories at home by double-figure margins over Washington and
Washington State during the last three days have not given Coach Steve
Lavin a false sense of security.</TE>
<TE>   "We are very concerned. USC is way out in front of us in terms of how
they play as a team," he said. "If we play like we did this weekend, it
will be a long, long season for the Bruins."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Michael Fey apparently will not join the UCLA team this season. The
winter quarter begins today, and the freshman center from Olympia, Wash.,
has not received a qualifying score on either the SAT or ACT. Fey, who
has signed a letter of intent, will continue to take the tests and
attempt to enroll in the fall.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Bruins will visit the City of Hope Cancer Center today at 4:30
p.m.</TE>
<TE>UP NEXT</TE>
<TE>   Thursday vs. USC (12-2, 4-0 in Pacific 10), 7:30 p.m. at the
Forum--The Bruins have won 13 of 14 against the Trojans since 1995,
losing only at the Sports Arena in 2000. The venue is the Forum because
the Sports Arena is being used for the U.S. Figure Skating Championships.
UCLA has not played at the Forum since it was used for the Pacific 10
Conference tournament in 1989.</TE>

Sunday, ending the defending national champion's 22-game winning streak
and leaving Division I without an unbeaten team.</LD>
<LD>   "It took every bit of the 40 minutes to get the win," said Florida
State Coach Steve Robinson, whose team had a 13-point lead with eight
minutes to play. "Once we got behind, I told them we've just got to make
some shots."</LD>
<TE>   Duke (12-1, 1-1 Atlantic Coast Conference) missed a chance to win when
Mike Dunleavy's tip of a miss by Jason Williams rimmed out at the buzzer.
But the Blue Devils hurt themselves with uncharacteristically poor
free-throw shooting, making only two of eight in the final 1:30 and only
seven of 19 in the game.</TE>
<TE>   Florida State, which pulled within 76-75 on Antwuan Dixon's
three-point basket with 28 seconds left, went to Cummings--a 25-year-old
Army veteran--for its final play.</TE>
<TE>   "I was knocking them down in the second half, so I felt good about
it," said the 6-foot-4 Cummings, who got past Williams when he tried to
draw a charge, then went baseline to the basket. "Somehow, Jason got
tangled up, and it helped me get by him."</TE>
<TE>   The victory was the first in 12 games against a top-ranked team for
Florida State (8-5, 1-1), which held the lead for most of the second
half.</TE>
<TE>   "You always have in the back of your mind, 'They're going to come
back, they're going to come back,"' Florida State guard Delvon Arrington
said. "We were on our heels, but we weren't flat-footed."</TE>
<TE>   Williams, who led all scorers with 26 points, missed six consecutive
free throws in the final 5:40, including four in the final 1:24. The last
two were with 20 seconds to play and would have given the Blue Devils a
three-point lead.</TE>
<TE>   "I promise you the next time I'm in that situation I will make them,"
Williams said. "Some of those things happen."</TE>
<TE>   Florida State, which lost games last month to American and Western
Carolina, hadn't beaten Duke since 1995.</TE>
<TE>   It was Robinson's first victory in 12 games against the Blue Devils.</TE>
<TE>   "They played better than we did," Duke Coach Mike Krzyzewski said.</TE>
<TE>   "We have a lot of work to do before we're some great basketball team.
We're not one right now."</TE>

<LD>Justin Turman wrapped his strong hands around the handlebars that
propelled the mechanical bull and proceeded to turn his teammates' lives
upside down.</LD>
<LD>   After a few seconds aboard the suddenly animated beast, each Los
Angeles Daniel Murphy High boys' basketball player went flying toward the
ground, landing with a thud, laughing all the way.</LD>
<LD>   It might not have seemed like it at the time, but Turman brought his
teammates and coaches to his grandfather's sprawling 40-acre ranch in
Lake Hughes over the weekend to share with them a sliver of the
tranquillity he has enjoyed since coming here as a child.</LD>
<TE>   The inner-city players, some making their first trip into the
countryside, spent Saturday riding horses, fetching hay and trying their
best to stay aboard the menacing bull, aptly named Mighty Bucky.</TE>
<TE>   "I think they'll learn the same thing I learned, just to enjoy nature,
have a good time and just chill out," said Turman, Murphy's star shooting
guard. "I think we will really [connect] as a team by coming out here."</TE>
<TE>   The ranch, replete with 2,500 peach trees, eight quarter horses and a
handful of live bulls, has long served as a soothing alternative to the
bustle of city life that forever changed Turman's life at the age of 2.</TE>
<TE>   That's when Turman's father, Glynn Jr., was stabbed in the heart and
killed during an altercation at Santa Monica Pier--in full view of the
young boy.</TE>
<TE>   "I'll always remember my father," said Turman, still scarred by images
he retains of the ordeal. "[But] I've moved on and don't let it bring me
down."</TE>
<TE>   Turman's coaches hoped that the weekend outing with his teammates
could further cement his recovery and serve as a team-building
experience.</TE>
<TE>   After the Nobles defeated Los Angeles Cathedral, 62-50, Friday night
to improve their record to 11-6, the coaches and 10 of their 11 players
piled into two vans and made the 75-mile trek into the Antelope Valley.</TE>
<TE>   Players stayed up into the early morning hours Saturday chatting and
playing dominoes, then rose to feed the horses and receive an impromptu
ride aboard a bulldozer. Turman even showed his teammates how to lasso a
steer, though a few nearly roped him instead.</TE>
<TE>   Turman's grandfather, Glynn Sr., served as the players' host during
most of the activities. An actor and director, best known for his role as
Col. Taylor on NBC's "A Different World," he coaxed the teenagers--even
the reluctant ones--onto horses while kidding them that they didn't live
up to their team's nickname.</TE>
<TE>   "Kick him and make him go faster," the elder Turman told Murphy guard
Thomas Carcamo, aboard a particularly slow-moving steed.</TE>
<TE>   "Naw--this is OK," Carcamo said, eliciting laughter from his
teammates.</TE>
<TE>   "It's wonderful to see them try so to overcome the unknown," Glynn Sr.
said. "You learn more about people when they're out of the environment
you usually see them in. Seeing a different side of one another is going
to be very helpful."</TE>
<TE>   Murphy Coach Andrew Hunter said he believes the experience could
translate to victories on the hardwood.</TE>
<TE>   "Getting on a horse is a major deal for a lot of them, and maybe
something they don't think they can overcome on the court, they'll now
have a positive attitude toward," Hunter said. "One of our main goals
coming out here is making sure they understand that their limitations are
what they put on themselves."</TE>
<TE>   Before the players broke for lunch, Hunter and assistant coach Mike
Rios had them form groups to discuss what they had learned during the
morning's activities. Turman, his group's spokesman, said players learned
to work together by lifting hay and could apply the lesson by trusting
each other on the court.</TE>
<TE>   Turman, a 6-foot-4 senior who averages 28 points but is not being
heavily recruited, has already earned his teammates' trust.</TE>
<TE>   "There's times where the team is really on the verge of submitting to
a loss, and he'll take that opportunity to gather them around and talk to
them, yell when necessary, and refocus us," Hunter said. "That's always
the sign of a special person, not just a special player."</TE>
<TE>   Glynn Turman said the responsibilities of life on the ranch have
instilled maturity in his grandson.</TE>
<TE>   "You're immediately affected if you don't collect wood in time because
you don't have wood for the fire," he said. "If you don't deal with the
orchard, you've missed a season. If you don't put your seed in the ground
before the rain comes, you have no crop.</TE>
<TE>   "He knows he's up here to work, and he does a man-sized job."</TE>
<TE>   Turman moved in with Glynn and Jo-An Turman, his step-grandmother,
when he was in the seventh grade, though his mother, a deputy in the Los
Angeles County Sheriff's Dept., still plays an active role in his life.
The family splits time between the ranch and a residence in South Central
Los Angeles. Turman said he prefers the rustic lifestyle, though his
grandparents wouldn't let him install a basketball hoop in order "to keep
it a little more country."</TE>
<TE>   Turman's grandparents are so proud of their ranch that they hold a
weeklong event each summer for inner-city children called Camp Gid D Up.
The camp, free of charge thanks to the support of sponsors, has grown
from 20 campers to more than 120 in 10 years..</TE>
<TE>   The Murphy players could see the benefits of a week in the country.</TE>
<TE>   "We hang out together at school all the time, but coming up here gives
us the chance to just be ourselves," said guard Derrick La Vigne. "We
don't have to worry about getting into trouble doing certain stuff. We
can just come out here and have fun."</TE>
<TE>   The ranch was instrumental in Turman's recovery from his father's
death. He said hanging out here, where he spends most of his summers and
just about every other weekend, is "like a burden off my heart. I just
come up here and it's peace and quiet."</TE>
<TE>   About five years ago, during a calm day, a gust of wind blew in,
seemingly from nowhere, and Turman thought he could hear his father
calling him. The place is named IX Winds Ranch because it receives wind
from nine directions.</TE>
<TE>   Turman recently confronted his father's murderer for the first time at
a parole hearing, making a tearful plea that the assailant "was a menace
to society and shouldn't be let out on parole." Parole was denied, and
Turman vows to see that the assailant spends as many more years as
possible in prison.</TE>
<TE>   Turman still thinks a lot about his dad, a basketball player who saw
his college career derailed by back and knee injuries. This season,
Turman has scrawled a dedication to him on a piece of tape that adorns
his left shoe. It reads: "This season's for you, dad."</TE>
<TE>   "I'm just trying to go out there and make him happy," Turman said,
"because I know he's looking down on me."</TE>
<TE>   But basketball is only part of the equation when it comes to Turman's
happiness.</TE>
<TE>   Said Turman: "That's basically all I do--I just play basketball and I
come out here and become a cowboy."</TE>

<DL>EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J.</DL>
<LD>The Kings' special teams continued their sparkling play Saturday
night, contributing two late goals in a 3-0 victory over the New York
Islanders at Uniondale, N.Y.</LD>
<LD>   After Bryan Smolinski scored a power-play goal with 7:23 to play and
Eric Belanger scored a short-handed, empty-net goal with 2:03 remaining,
the Kings' power-play and penalty-killing units have outscored opponents,
40-25.</LD>
<LD>   At even strength, however, the Kings have been outscored, 69-62.</LD>
<TE>   "Our problem has been our five-on-five play," Coach Andy Murray said.
"We've talked about that, the things we need to do: the communication
that we need to have; making better decisions with the puck; eliminating
turnovers at the offensive blue line; having our defensemen make that
good first pass so they don't put themselves in trouble in our zone; and
certainly competing as hard as we possibly can.</TE>
<TE>   "We've got some guys that have some pretty good offensive numbers and
yet their plus-minus is not at the level we'd like to have it. So we
asked our players to step it up. We know we're going to be good on
special teams. We have to be better five on five."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Kings' victory over the Islanders was their first in 10 games in
which Jason Allison has not made a measurable contribution. They are
1-7-1-1 when he does not score a point.... Felix Potvin made 28 saves
against the Islanders after making 29 in Wednesday night's 3-1 victory
over the Florida Panthers. His season high is 30.</TE>

<LD>With 38 games remaining and a choppy February schedule ahead, the
Mighty Ducks understand that their hopes of making a run for the playoffs
are vanishing fast.</LD>
<LD>  The Ducks are 13-23-5-3 and 12 points away from the eighth playoff spot
in the Western Conference. Coach Bryan Murray remains optimistic but he
also has been around long enough to know that the Ducks simply do not
score enough to reach the postseason.</LD>
<LD>  "This is a hard part for us because we know the level of team we should
be or could be," Murray said. "I tell the guys all the time, I think our
effort, defensive play and attitude has been very good. We just haven't
scored.</LD>
<TE>  "I don't think our playoff chances are fading at this point but I will
tell you that we have to win some games now. We have to get a streak
going. We still have a chance but we have to get over a hurdle."</TE>
<TE>  The Ducks have scored only 94 goals this season, the second-lowest
total in the Western Conference, and have lost 13 games by a goal.</TE>
<TE>  "It's pretty frustrating when they are not going in, especially when we
are one goal away every game," said leading scorer Paul Kariya, who has
only 13 goals this season.</TE>
