<HD>Comedy-Watching to Ease Pain: It's No Joke</HD>

<LD>What if watching television was good for you? This question dogged
Sherry Dunay Hilber, a TV executive (naturally), who after much
success (her hit shows include "Roseanne" and "Home Improvement")
wanted something more than money and fame. A volunteer project put
her in contact with sick children. She thought maybe she could use
her TV experience to help them.</LD>
<LD>   "All I ever hear is the negative effects of programming," she said
in a recent phone interview.</LD>
<LD>   So, four years ago, Hilber enlisted the support of UCLA
pediatrician Lonnie Zeltzer and child psychiatrist Margaret Stuber to
develop a study of the effects of comedy on children who are
terminally ill or in serious pain.</LD>
<TE>   The Comedy Central cable network gave them $75,000 for the first
two phases of a five-year study conducted through UCLA's Jonsson
Cancer Center. The results were impressive. Stuber and Zeltzer found
that children may tolerate pain longer while watching funny TV shows.
But more money is needed to prove what is now a theory.</TE>
<TE>   So tonight Emmy winner Ray Romano of CBS' "Everybody Loves
Raymond," Kevin James, the star of CBS' "The King of Queens," and
stand-up comic Wendy Liebman will entertain supporters at UCLA's
Royce Hall to raise (they hope) as much as $100,000 for the project,
named Rx Laughter. Even without the money, though, Hilber feels she's
making strides to help change views on television comedy. "People are
taking it seriously now instead of just thinking it's cute," she
said. And she added, "eventually, there could be a prescription [of
comedy] based on hard-core research."</TE>
<TE>   It's a Material (Auction) World</TE>
<TE>   Reinventing yourself requires a regular cleaning of the closet,
and if you're Madonna, that's an event others may want to mark on
their calendars. At least, that's what Sothebys.ebay.com is banking
on with its "Blonde Ambition" sale, an online auction of jewelry and
clothes from Madonna's previous lives.</TE>
<TE>   There's the Material Girl necklace (estimated at $2,000), those
black rubber bangles, also from that phase (a mere $1,000), and
costumes from the videos for "Vogue" ($20,000) and "La Isla Bonita"
($10,000).</TE>
<TE>   "Madonna is one of the top collectible personalities of all time,"
said Darren Julien, president of EntertainmentRarities.com, which is
presenting the auction with Sothebys.ebay.com. In terms of
collectibility, he added, Madonna is right up there with Elvis and
Marilyn--except that she's alive.</TE>
<TE>   (For those interested, the online bidding closes Sunday.)</TE>
<TE>   Maripol, the designer who helped create the Madonna look of the
'80s, reminisced about the good old Day-Glo days. "It wasn't only
about fashion or music," she said. "Madonna really changed
everything. It was something special--she filled a void."</TE>
<TE>   Maripol is French, uses only one name and calls herself an "image
producer." She is working on a movie about another friend of that
period, the artist Jean-Michel Basquiat. "Not the one with [Julian]
Schnabel," she said with that little snort the French do so well,
referring to Schnabel's 1996 biopic, but "the real Basquiat."</TE>
<TE>   Asked about Madonna's latest incarnation as Mrs. Guy Ritchie,
Maripol said the pop star had become a little "plain," but, she added
philosophically, at some point even a new wave/disco queen needs
normality.</TE>
<TE>   And, said the designer responsible for the thousand bangles,
"thank God we got out of the '80s."</TE>
<TE>   Words From a 'Chicklet' Writer</TE>
<TE>   It's unlikely that Sylvester Stallone, director Michael Mann and
billionaire-about-town Steve Bing would show up at the book party of
just any 27-year-old, first-time novelist. Unless, of course, that
novelist is Rebecca Bloom, daughter of the Hollywood power duo
entertainment attorney Jake Bloom and activist-philanthropist Ruth
Bloom. (Bing and Mann are family friends. Stallone is a client.)</TE>
<TE>   Contrary to first impressions, however, Rebecca says she is
determined to forge her own way. She has trained to be a chef,
designs clothing and jewelry, and, on Tuesday night at the Buffalo
Club in Santa Monica, celebrated the publication of her first book,
"Girl Anatomy" (HarperCollins), a work in the "chicklet genre," she
says. The novel is loosely based on her experiences as a single woman
in her 20s who braves L.A. nightlife in search of Mr. Right, or, in
some cases, Mr. Right Now.</TE>
<TE>   "My friends say, 'We need captions over our heads with our
character names,' " Bloom told a group of well-wishers. Dressed all
in white, Bloom embraced the spotlight, even noting that she feels a
little like Sarah Jessica Parker's Carrie on HBO's "Sex and the
City." The single life, the book launch, the stars--"It's sort of
happening to me too," she said.</TE>
<TE>   A moment later, she headed to the book-signing table to give
Stallone an autographed copy. A publicist noted under her breath,
"It's all about relationships."</TE>

<HD>Actors Giving Clothes Off Their Back for Charity</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MICHAEL QUINTANILLA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>They sweated in them for almost two hours, but the actors wearing the
designer gowns and tuxedos on the sweltering red carpet at Sunday's
Emmy Awards have had their duds dry-cleaned.</LD>
<LD>   And now Jane Kaczmarek's black lace creation by Heidi Kaczenski,
Wendie Malick's champagne-colored cocktail dress by Estevan Ramos and
Allison Janney's red number by Erik Gaskins are on the block at
www.Ubid .com to raise funds for UNICEF, Cure Autism Now, the Union
of Concerned Scientists and Heifer International.</LD>
<LD>   The idea for the first "Clothes Off Our Back" charity auction,
which runs through Oct. 7, came from a group of actors, including
Kaczmarek, who is seven months pregnant; her husband, Bradley
Whitford; and Janel Moloney.</LD>
<TE>   "I'm not a sample size, so I always buy the gown, but it's pretty
easy for celebrities to keep them. And you can never wear them again,
so why not donate them to a great cause?" Kaczmarek said.</TE>
<TE>   Some of the auctioned outfits were purchased by the actors; others
were loaned to the stars by designers who later agreed to donate them
to the cause, she said.</TE>
<TE>   In all, 10 gowns and nine tuxes can be viewed on the Web site.
They include the purple Halston worn by Patricia Clarkson, the
Thierry Mugler creation for Patricia Heaton and the vintage Christian
Dior that Jennifer Aniston wore, which as of midday Thursday had 23
bidders with the highest offer at $8,900.</TE>
<TE>   Kaczmarek, who raises funds for several charities, said she and
others had planned the first auction for last year, but the 2001
Emmys kept to a businesslike dress code in deference to Sept. 11. So
she brought up the idea again this year and, with help from others,
contacted nominees about participating. She also publicized the
auction on the red carpet, handing out cards about the Web site. "The
idea behind the auction is all about what can you do to give back."</TE>

<LD>THE WISHED FOR COUNTRY</LD>
<LD>   By Wayne Carlin</LD>
<LD>   Curbstone Press</LD>
<TE>   342 pages, $16.95 (paper)</TE>
<TE>   Children in Maryland public schools half a century ago learned
about the arrival of the Catholic colonists on the Ark and the Dove
in 1634 and the famous Act of Toleration of 1649, granting the
freedom of the colony to both Catholics and Protestants.</TE>
<TE>   They did not learn about the miseries that greeted the new
colonists, nor about the dire conditions of the indentured servants
who made up the majority of the colonists, nor the ubiquitous
presence of black slaves, nor the bloody battles with the Indians. In
particular, they were not made aware that around St. Mary's City in
southernmost Maryland there exists to this day a community of people
descended from the couplings in the colony's earliest days of whites,
blacks and Native Americans.</TE>
<TE>   They were, and are, called Wesorts, presumably from "we sort of
people." They spoke a special kind of pidgin English, traces of which
survive.</TE>
<TE>   "The Wished For Country" is Wayne Karlin's attempt in novel form
to bring to life the original Wesorts and their turbulent world. It
is of a piece with the movement among many modern historians to go
beyond and below the traditional view of history as the sum of its
major figures to limn the lives and actions of the common people. His
nonprofit publisher, Curbstone Press, specializes in that kind of
history.</TE>
<TE>   Karlin is a professor in southern Maryland who has published three
previous books and a memoir, "Rumors and Stones," about searching in
Poland for family members who disappeared in the Holocaust. He lives
among descendants of his characters in "The Wished For Country."</TE>
<TE>   As an attempt at re-creating history, the novel is commendable. He
mixes people remembered by history with characters he has invented.
His description of the territory--steamy hot and mosquito-ridden in
summer, damp and dismally cold in winter--is vivid. The woods and
waters of southern Maryland and its neighborhood, stretching from the
Great Falls of the Potomac to the gigantic cypresses of the Great
Dismal Swamp in Virginia, are presented as they must have been in
those days.</TE>
<TE>   "The Wished For Country," a phrase from the journal of the
historical Jesuit father Andrew White, is ironic. For the country
that all of them--Catholic gentlemen, Protestant indentured servants,
Indians and black slaves--eventually got was something none of them
could have wanted.</TE>
<TE>   The book does a good job of describing how it all might have come
about: The rivalry of Catholic and Protestant settlers; their
alliances with Indian tribes fighting one another; the Jesuits'
attempts to convert the Indians; the slaves' terrible life at the
bottom of the heap and the endless torture and killing. Life was
nasty, and it was brutal and it was short.</TE>
<TE>   As a novel, the book is less successful. Most of the principal
characters are stylized rather than fully realized. Their language is
too often grandiose without the ring of authenticity. Their musings
about God and Christ sound excessively academic. Karlin's attempt to
convey the thoughts of a panther is especially unpersuasive.</TE>
<TE>   One character, the leading one, does appear in full face and body.
That he does is remarkable, for he is the one you might think least
accessible to a 21st century writer trying to imagine life in a 17th
century backwater. He is Ezekiel, a slave from Dahomey by way of
Barbados. Of Ezekiel, Karlin writes with passion and empathy.</TE>
<TE>   Among those Karlin generously credits for help in writing his book
is Lucille Clifton, "who," he says, "lent me some of the story of her
Dahomey ancestors, and their gifted fingers [in carving wood] and the
gifts they have given her of seeing the true patterns under the
illusions and mists of this world, and for bringing that vision to
words." Karlin's dexterous translation of that vision is one of this
book's special pleasures.</TE>

<HD>Smoke From the Fire Rewrites School Rules</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>J. MICHAEL KENNEDY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Greg Plutko is looking for a new place for his football team to play
its first home game tonight. His main requirement is that it be
smoke-free.</LD>
<LD>   Plutko is principal of Glendora High School, and the forest fire
raging in the Angeles National Forest, just north of the city, has
made it impossible to play a game there. The smoke is just too thick.</LD>
<LD>   Ditto for the cross-country team, which moved its practice to
Mount San Antonio College, about 10 miles south of the fires.
Normally, students at the high school eat outdoors, but the gym has
been opened to guard them against potential lung damage the smoke can
cause.</LD>
<TE>   The scene is much the same throughout the communities that hug the
San Gabriel Mountains, from La Canada Flintridge to the west to well
beyond San Bernardino in the east. The fire has created such a pall
of smoke that it has disrupted lives in large and small ways.</TE>
<TE>   The greatest impact, of course, is on those who have watched as
the fire crept down the mountainside toward their homes. Several
times during the week parents have called to say they are picking up
their children from school so they can help evacuate their homes.
"It's been a challenge," Plutko said.</TE>
<TE>   It has also been a deterrent to the rhythm of everyday life, as
people have made adjustments to keep from being harmed by the
inhalation of smoke. As it has for the last several days, the South
Coast Air Quality Management District issued another smoke alert
Thursday advising against vigorous outdoor exercise such as running
and cycling. City workers along the fire's front have been told to
avoid heavy exertion.</TE>
<TE>   "We're not going to have anybody digging today or have anybody fix
irrigation lines where they have to do strenuous exercising," said
Acquanetta Warren, operations manager for the Upland Public Works
Department.</TE>
<TE>   But primarily, schools have borne the brunt of the smoky skies.
Martin Plourde, principal of Arcadia High, said he is constantly
calling for air-quality updates so decisions can be made about
upcoming events and activities.</TE>
<TE>   Smoke was so evident Thursday morning, some sports activities were
moved to the afternoon. "Like a lot of schools, we are looking at all
the games we have scheduled," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Others have been more directly affected. Goddard Middle School in
Glendora was so close to the fire on Tuesday that several hundred
people watched the burn from the campus. All the children have been
eating lunch inside classrooms.</TE>
<TE>   The school also wanted to show its appreciation to firefighters,
who had a command post a half-mile away. On Wednesday, students
delivered 1,000 bottles of soda and water to the firefighters.</TE>
<TE>   "The kids are being outstanding," said Dominic DiGrazia, Goddard's
principal. "They are being very adaptable and very flexible."</TE>
<TE>   To the west, Barbara Vilmur, the health clerk at Mountain Avenue
Elementary School in La Crescenta, has seen the smoke's effect on
students.</TE>
<TE>   "Some kids have said their eyes are burning," she said. "Some kids
have been asking for their inhalers more."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The American Lung Assn. of California offers these recommendations to
protect residents affected by the forest fires.</LD>
<LD>   * Remain indoors to avoid inhalation of smoke, ashes and
particulate matter. Refrain from outdoor exercising, particularly if
you smell smoke or experience eye or throat irritation.</LD>
<LD>   * When driving through smoky areas, keep windows and vents closed.</LD>
<TE>   * People with respiratory problems should stay indoors as much as
possible, with doors, windows and fireplace dampers shut.</TE>
<TE>   * If outdoors in a smoky area, breathe through a damp cloth.</TE>
<TE>   * People with lung and heart problems should avoid cleanup
activities where dust or soot is present.</TE>
<TE>   * Thoroughly wet sooty areas during cleanup and wear an
appropriate dust mask.</TE>
<TE>   * Consult a physician if experiencing wheezing, shortness of
breath, light headedness and dizziness.</TE>

<LD>'Cantata misericordium'</LD>
<LD>   Have you ever sent a birthday card or sung "Happy Birthday" to a
friend or family member? If so, you have commemorated, or noted,
someone's birth in a special way. There are many ways to commemorate
a person or event, such as with a stamp, a painting, a poem or even
with a song.</LD>
<LD>   The Red Cross, an organization that provides disaster relief to
people around the world, has been recognized for its outstanding and
important work many times since it was founded in 1864. For its 100th
birthday, or centenary, in 1964, many nations celebrated the
occasion. British composer Benjamin Britten wrote a piece of music
for voice and orchestra.</LD>
<TE>   Called "Cantata misericordium" (Latin for "songs for the
blessed"), it is based on the parable of the good Samaritan, which
tells the story of a man who is robbed and left by the side of the
road, fearful and lonely. Several travelers from his own tribe pass
him but do not offer help. Finally, a man from a different tribe--a
Samaritan--comes to his aid. The musical piece ends with the choir
singing, "Go and do likewise." It is a very moving tribute to the Red
Cross.</TE>
<TE>   You are invited to hear the Los Angeles Master Chorale sing this
work at 7 p.m. Sunday at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion.</TE>
<TE>   In the lobby, you can also see a beautiful collection of drawings,
collages, paintings and words in which Californians of all ages
expressed their thoughts and reactions to the attacks of Sept. 11,
2001. Called "The California Remembrance Project," the display was
organized by the San Gabriel Valley Chapter of the American Red Cross
and the California Arts Council. For ticket information, call (213)
972-7282 or visit www.lamc.org.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The left's propensity to treat changes in opinion as apostasy always
has lent its fallings-out more than a whiff of rancor.</LD>
<LD>   Thus, while both Christopher Hitchens--who this week abruptly quit
as the Nation's Washington columnist--and the magazine's New
York-based editors are at pains to paint their parting as civilized,
if not amicable, the sudden split has left both sides bruised.</LD>
<LD>   According to Nation staff members, who asked not to be named, the
magazine's editors were particularly upset that they first learned of
Hitchens' resignation when they read the "Minority Report" column he
submitted for the forthcoming issue.</LD>
<TE>   In that piece, which will be published in the Nation being mailed
to subscribers this week, Hitchens writes that it would be "false to
continue the association" and concludes, "When I began work for the
Nation over two decades ago, Victor Navasky [then editor, now
publisher] described the magazine as a debating ground between
liberals and radicals, which was, I thought, well judged. In the past
few weeks, though, I have come to realize that the magazine itself
takes a side in the argument, and is becoming the voice and echo
chamber of those who truly believe that John Ashcroft is a greater
menace than Osama bin Laden."</TE>
<TE>   Hitchens, who was traveling and unavailable for comment, has been
increasingly at odds with the Nation and its readers since Sept. 11.
The English-born columnist has taken a hard line in support of the
Bush administration's war on terror and repeatedly has written about
the Saudi-supported Wahabi sect's role in fostering Islamic
fundamentalism throughout the world. He has argued unequivocally that
militant Islam is a totalitarian creed that must be opposed
intellectually and militarily wherever it exists. In recent months,
Hitchens also has supported the administration's indictment of Saddam
Hussein's malevolence, though he remains cautious about military
action.</TE>
<TE>   Those positions have put him intellectually and emotionally at
odds with his Nation colleagues, who have been deeply skeptical of
the Bush administration's initiatives on all fronts and,
particularly, about their implications for domestic civil liberties.
Though he, too, is a firm civil libertarian, Hitchens' close
associates said this week that he had become "deeply dispirited"
about the hostility to his columns expressed by readers in the
Nation's letters columns.</TE>
<TE>   "Hitch is exhausted," said one person with whom he discussed his
decision. "He's got other places to publish here in the United
States--Vanity Fair, the New York Review of Books and the Atlantic.
It all got to be too much and, since the Nation had become such a
source of grief, he just said, 'Who needs it?' "</TE>
<TE>   Navasky, too, was unavailable for comment, but colleagues with
whom he spoke said he was wounded by Hitchens' decision. It was
Navasky who invited the writer to the United States more than two
decades ago and who suggested that the young Englishman become the
Nation's first Washington-based columnist since I.F. Stone. Hitchens
and his wife, Carol Blue, were married in the living room of
Navasky's apartment.</TE>
<TE>   Katrina vanden Heuvel, the Nation's editor, said she regretted
Hitchens' resignation. "We have enjoyed publishing someone who has
always had the freedom to write what they wanted and to challenge
many of our readers' assumptions," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Others at the Nation feel that Hitchens' columns had become not
just a challenge but an affront to the magazine's views. According to
staff members, suspicion of what they viewed as the writer's
rightward drift began some years ago, when he first expressed
reservations about abortion. His relentless rhetorical pursuit of
Bill Clinton--whose impeachment he supported--raised further doubts,
which grew exponentially after Sept. 11. Those staff members were
said to be relieved that Hitchens no longer would be identified as a
Nation columnist during his frequent appearances on television.</TE>
<TE>   Suffice it to say, the last word on this split has yet to be
heard.</TE>
<TE>   Booker Prize Short List</TE>
<TE>   Though it is only open to writers from Commonwealth nations,
Britain's Booker Prize is avidly followed by readers of serious
fiction throughout the world. In part, that's because of its sizable
cash component--a little more than $75,000 for this year's
winner--and in part, because the BBC's live broadcast of its award
gives the ceremony something of the Oscars' cachet.</TE>
<TE>   "Most Booker winners already have American publishers," said one
prominent New York agent, "but winning usually gets a book a bigger
U.S. printing. Where it really helps is with the film sales. Studios
seem to like Brit writers almost as much as English actors. It's the
class factor."</TE>
<TE>   Oddly enough, though, the one thing this year's "short list" of
Booker finalists lacks is an English author. The final six, culled
from a long list of 20 selected from 130 entries, include three
immigrants to Canada--Yann Martel, Rohinton Mistry and Carol
Shields--the Irish-born William Trevor, Australian Tim Winton and
Welsh-born Sarah Waters.</TE>
<TE>   This year's favorite is Martel's "Life of Pi," the story of a boy
brought up in an Indian zoo. When his father decides to move the
family and its animals to Canada, a shipwreck ensues and the boy, Pi,
is cast adrift in a lifeboat with a hyena, a zebra, an orangutan and
a tiger. The author, who now lives in Montreal, was born in Spain.</TE>
<TE>   Mistry, who has lived in Canada since 1975, was nominated for
"Family Matters," which is set in his native Bombay. Shields, who was
born and raised in Chicago but has lived in Canada since 1957, was
nominated for "Unless," which deals with the relationship between
mothers and daughters. Shields, the mother of five, won the 1995
Pulitzer Prize for fiction with "The Stone Diaries."</TE>
<TE>   Trevor, who has been short-listed twice, was nominated for "The
Story of Lucy Gault." Waters' nominated novel, "Fingersmith," is the
story of a 19th century orphan; Winton's "Dirt Music" is set in an
Australian fishing port.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it's a perfectly good list," said Giles Foden, deputy
literary editor of the Guardian, which publishes one of Britain's
most comprehensive book supplements. "The Canadian thing is quite
interesting and can be explained, I think, by Canada's extremely
fruitful history of immigration over the past 50 years. Young writers
have come there from all over the world and found a massive canvas of
the imagination not yet loaded with other people's images.</TE>
<TE>   "Martel is certainly the favorite, since he's much favored by our
chattering classes. I think the best and most interesting choice is
Sarah Waters because she is such a good writer," Foden said.</TE>
<TE>   Work in Progress</TE>
<TE>   Poe Ballantine is the pseudonym of Kevin Hughes, who writes and
cooks professionally in Chadron, Neb. His collection of personal
travel narratives, "Things I Like About America," will be published
next month by Hawthorne Books:</TE>
<TE>   "I'm finishing up a novel called 'God Clobbers Us All,' which is
set in a San Diego convalescent hospital. My editors like it but
think it's too short, so I'm rewriting four new chapters for them. I
hope this does the trick.</TE>
<TE>   "The plot and setting are a composite of my actual experience as a
very young nurse's aide in hospitals around San Diego. I grew up
there and took a course on being a hospital attendant while I was
going to Patrick Henry High in 1973. I was 18 when I went to work,
and it was a powerful experience that transformed me. I got a good
look at where most of America ends up. Seeing death and debilitation
close up at 18 has made me a live-for-today kind of fellow ever
since. My characters are all nurse's aides. One of the primary
characters is a Blackfoot lesbian, ostracized by her family and
desperate to have some fun. The other ends up damaged, bewildered and
lost at the end of the book. All the characters are the sort of
working people who appear close knit on the job, but dissolve very
easily. They all get clobbered too--by fate, I suppose."</TE>

<HD>Train Is Right on Track for Elegant Look</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jeannine Stein</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Dear Fashion Police: I attended a social event recently where women
wore beautiful gowns. One had a train, not very long, but it did drag
along the ground. I thought it looked silly. What do you think?</LD>
<LD>   --TRAIN SPOTTED</LD>
<LD>   Dear Train: Call us a hopeless romantic, but we actually like the
look of a train on a dress. There's just something about the elegant,
elongated line and the gentle sweep of the fabric--traditionally seen
on wedding dresses--that we find appealing. We love them on evening
gowns as well.</LD>
<TE>   The practicality of a train is another thing altogether. Should
someone step on it, not only could the dress rip, but also the wearer
could pitch backward when she tries to walk. Dragging the train on
the ground is inevitable and will result in a dirty hem, but if the
wearer is willing to sacrifice cleanliness for aesthetics, then by
all means she should go for it. Those who do decide to go for it
should pick up the train while walking on the street.</TE>
<TE>   Where did the train originate, some of you may be wondering? It
seems to date back to 14th century Europe, although the specific
country of origin is unclear, according to Sharon Takeda, senior
curator and department head of costume and textiles at the Los
Angeles County Museum of Art.</TE>
<TE>   "Trains were introduced along with other features," she explained,
"such as set-in sleeves and dagging--a way of cutting the edges of a
garment so they were jagged--that were wasteful in terms of the
amount of fabric required for construction. The conspicuous waste was
something in which only the wealthy could engage, so details such as
trains would convey the wearer's wealth and status. It follows that
the longer the train, the higher the status, so the queen's train
would be longer than the princess'."</TE>
<TE>   Dear Fashion Police: Help! Hemline emergency! Although the stores
are still full of long skirts, every time I go out I see only shorter
hemlines--below the knee or mid-calf. I feel so uncomfortable in my
long skirt that I want to go home! Where are hemlines this season?
And what should I do with my long skirts?</TE>
<TE>   --HEMMED IN</TE>
<TE>   Dear Hemmed: For goodness sake, wear them! Where are you going
that all you see are shorter skirts? A flood region?</TE>
<TE>   Hemlines are available in every length, and it has been that way
and will be that way. A few decades ago women had little or no choice
as to how long their skirts were. We fondly recall old photographs of
women of all ages in the 1960s in miniskirts.</TE>
<TE>   Today, thankfully, it's a different story. Women have a plethora
of lengths to choose from every season, from micromini to down to the
ground, available in department stores, boutiques, online retailers
and catalogs. Granted, certain trends in lengths do catch on, so you
may be seeing a lot of minis one season, but there are always
alternatives.</TE>
<TE>   For fall, we're seeing many daytime looks just at or below the
knee. This doesn't mean you have to wear that, though. When choosing
a length that's right for you, consider what is most comfortable and
flattering. Everyone's body is different, and some women love to show
off a great pair of gams, while others prefer to keep them completely
hidden. Some women simply like the long, fluid line of an
ankle-length hemline, whether in a narrow or full silhouette.</TE>
<TE>   Also, consider where the skirt or dress will be worn. Funerals are
bad places for ultra-short skirts, and beach parties probably aren't
the best places for long skirts.</TE>
<TE>   Don't run home; wear your long skirt proudly. We certainly are.</TE>

<DH>Fashion icon Lilly Pulitzer, 70, stages first show in city
to display her retro-look line</DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>NEW YORK--If she were a rock star, Lilly Pulitzer would by now have
starred in a VH-1 "Behind the Music." Her life story follows the
biography show's template of fame, fortune and misfortune, complete
with the redemptive ending. She was born to wealth, married a
millionaire, created her own fortune with a colorful namesake
clothing line and then lived through the multiple indignities of
bankruptcy, scandal and--worse--the scourge of being declared out of
style.</LD>
<LD>   At 70, Pulitzer is riding the retro revival wave that has her
clothes selling for the same reasons that make the middle-aged pay to
see rock stars who qualify for membership in AARP. Her clothes, like
classic songs, stand for a simpler, happier time. They're also visual
shorthand for WASP success and pink-and-green-clad preppies.</LD>
<LD>   Pulitzer, for those unfamiliar with the status symbols of the rich
at play, is the unlikely creator of the simply-cut but wildly
patterned dresses, skirts, pants and more that, beginning in the
early '60s, dominated Palm Beach, Fla., parties and other resorts of
privilege for nearly 25 years. Pulitzer's schoolmate Jacqueline
Kennedy and her daughter, Caroline, were often seen in matching Lilly
Pulitzer outfits.</LD>
<TE>   The allure of "Lillys," as the short-shift dresses came to be
known in the '60s and '70s, spread along the jet routes of wealthy
fans, helping to build a chain of 32 Lilly Pulitzer stores.</TE>
<TE>   For all of her storied career, however, Pulitzer never bothered
with staging a New York fashion show. Finally, late last week, her
new business partners, Pennsylvania entrepreneur and president James
Bradbeer Jr., and chief executive officer Scott Beaumont, both
Harvard Business School graduates, convinced Pulitzer it was time to
take a bow. Crews filled the Celeste Bartos Forum in the New York
Public Library with palm trees, her signature sunny prints and passed
lemonade garnished with mint sprigs.</TE>
<TE>   So many men, women and children showed up wearing the label's
distinctive pink, green, floral and palm-frond prints that the entire
audience could have passed for wallpaper at the Beverly Hills Hotel.</TE>
<TE>   Although it is customary at designer shows for guests to wear
their support, the level of enthusiasm for Pulitzer's brand of casual
clothing bordered on the cultish. South Carolina retailer David Shaw
strolled an after-show cocktail party in vintage 1970s print,
patchwork pants, of the hand-worked sort that no longer are made. His
wife, Shirley, said Southern sorority houses are staging Lilly trunk
shows and the line is gaining popularity with 12- to 14-year-olds.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps it's no wonder that the rarely seen Pulitzer was showered
with the week's most appreciative and genuine standing ovation. Much
to her great embarrassment, the tough, blunt and unsentimental
grandmother cried as she walked slowly down the catwalk wearing one
of her signature print shirts, white trousers and a blond bob.</TE>
<TE>   "Did I look like an idiot up there?" she said minutes later,
surrounded by her family. Quickly recovering, Pulitzer scolded her
friends and family for being 20 minutes late for a dinner the
previous evening. "I was there for one hour sitting at a table for 10
alone," she said. "I would rather be on the 'Today' show every single
day than sit there at a table for 10--alone!" She appeared on the
popular morning program last week to discuss her New York show and
stage a mini-preview.</TE>
<TE>   It was hard to resist the charms of the spring 2003 line,
especially when the first looks down the runway included a mother and
three barefoot little girls in matching Lillys. They immediately
recalled so much history.</TE>
<TE>   As a daughter in the Ogden Phipps family, one of the oldest and
wealthiest in Palm Beach, and as the wife of Peter Pulitzer, heir of
the publishing empire, Lilly lived the life of leisure, until she
became so bored and exhausted from having three children, she had to
spend several months recovering in a mental hospital. For
therapy--and something to do--in 1959 she opened a juice stand on Via
Mizner, off Palm Beach's Worth Avenue, using the produce from her
husband's orchards.</TE>
<TE>   The juice making was messy, so Pulitzer had her seamstress stitch
up wildly patterned dresses that would hide the stains. Soon
customers were more interested in her clothes than in juice, and her
fashion career was launched. After her marriage ended in 1969, she
married Cuban rancher and lawyer Enrique Rousseau. Her family became
embroiled in the scandalous divorce trial of her ex-husband Peter and
his second wife, Roxanne. All the while, Pulitzer's business grew
into a multimillion-dollar enterprise that included everything from
bedsheets to nightshirts, which she named "Sneaky Petes," after her
first husband.</TE>
<TE>   Her casual clothes remained staples in the wardrobes of socialites
and their children, but when fashion turned its back on her upbeat
colors and patterns, Pulitzer's business was forced into Chapter 11
bankruptcy protection and later closed in 1984. During the subsequent
fashion eras of heroin chic, gothic romance, minimalist chic and
worse, looking happy, colorful and casual was as unsightly as an
orange juice stain on white silk.</TE>
<TE>   As fashion companies around the world began to seek time-tested
brands, in 1993 Bradbeer and Beaumont convinced her it was time for a
comeback. Though the clothing had fans who plucked the quirky
patterns from thrift stores, the new incarnation needed edge. An
advisory committee of New York and Palm Beach socialites was convened
in 1998 to cull opinions on what the collection needed to appeal to a
new generation.</TE>
<TE>   This year, a Los Angeles advisory committee including Josie
Bissett, Caroline O'Donnell, socialite Patty Penske, fashion industry
insiders Jennifer Nordstrom and Crystal Moffett Lourd, and others,
added their insights in exchange for the opportunity to buy new items
at a discount.</TE>
<TE>   The spring collection recalls the collection's old-fashioned charm
and its new-fashioned sex appeal with au courant caftans, cropped
polo shirts, prints on silk and spandex blends, and even a fun twist
on the matching mother-daughter dresses: father-daughter matching
pants.</TE>
<TE>   Though her role now is as consultant to a design team, Pulitzer
hasn't changed her plain-spoken manner. Her assessment of the slow
acceptance of her new line in Los Angeles?</TE>
<TE>   "Overdue," she exclaimed. The Lilly look in L.A.  isn't so much
head-to-toe country club, but a piecemeal assortment of bikinis and
miniskirts. "I think the West Coast has always been a little slower
than the East," she said. Celebrities such as Ashley Judd, Jenna
Elfman and Brooke Shields have been introducing it to the Hollywood
community. But Pulitzer is starting a grass-roots comeback in Los
Angeles. "I've got two grandchildren out there," she said, "so we're
brainwashing them."</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Life expectancy just hit a new high--76.9 years. This may seem like
good news. It's not.</LD>
<LD>   It is actually rather disturbing news, because it means the baby
boomers now boogalooing toward golden oldie-hood are going to be
hanging out even longer once they get there. And this geriatric
logjam is going to alter the culture in truly alarming ways:</LD>
<LD>   Cars: The average vehicle will be larger than anything on the road
today. It will have a top speed of 35 mph for interstate driving,
power everything and a heater capable of producing subtropical
temperatures.</LD>
<TE>   Communication: It will be much noisier, and not only because of
the number of people talking to themselves. Hearing aids will still
make better dog whistles than listening devices, so shouting, usually
over a blaring television, will be how people converse.</TE>
<TE>   Restrooms: There will be many, many more restrooms. In fact, the
need for restrooms will be so great that restrooms will contain
restrooms to accommodate people waiting to use the restroom.</TE>
<TE>   Home design: To cut down on middle-of-the-night traffic, bedrooms
will be located in bathrooms.</TE>
<TE>   Meals: They will be served promptly at 4 o'clock--in the morning
and afternoon.</TE>
<TE>   Food: It will be fast, soft and bodily functional.</TE>
<TE>   Dating: Such considerations as looks, personality, wealth and fame
will remain important, but the most coveted quality in a potential
paramour will be the ability to drive at night.</TE>
<TE>   Fashion: Think jeans and leather jackets with matching white shoes
and belts. Spandex will still be in, only to wear it in public, you
will have to pass tests. Also, wearing a cap backward past a certain
age will be a felony.</TE>
<TE>   Parties: They will begin early and go on until the break of dark.</TE>
<TE>   Naps: Naps will be known by a new name--happy hour.</TE>
<TE>   Television: Medical shows will be huge, particularly ones in which
celebrities talk about their recent surgeries.</TE>
<TE>   Telemarketers: No-call lists will remain in force, only now
telemarketers will be the ones seeking to be left alone by relentless
seniors with time on their hands and getting even in their hearts.</TE>
<TE>   Music: We will not rock as much as we will shake, rattle and be
rolled. Dylan, Aerosmith and the Stones will still be touring, of
course, and for the first time, Keith Richards will look no worse
than anyone else.</TE>
<TE>   Sex: It will not be extinct, but its frequency might best be
summed up in the following joke:</TE>
<TE>   "Want to go upstairs and have sex?"</TE>
<TE>   "Sorry, but I can't do both."</TE>

<HD>Where High Art Meets High Arches</HD>
<DH>Top shoemakers, artists take the unusual step of teaming
for a party at Bergdorf's</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GERALDINE BAUM</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>It seemed incongruous to have high art in the second-floor shoe
department of Bergdorf's.</LD>
<LD>   But there it was Wednesday night--along with a pack of rich art
patrons savagely pursuing a pair of red satin 5-inch spikes with long
straps and a black-and-white beaded patch on the toe.</LD>
<LD>   Seven artists each had designed a shoe. Seven top shoemakers had
produced them in limited editions of 20 pairs. Bergdorf Goodman sold
them for $650 to $1,200 a pair, using the occasion to launch its
renovated shoe salon. The New Museum of Contemporary Art benefited
from the sales, earning $70,000, which doesn't seem like a lot
considering the price of a good painting, but not bad for shoes.</LD>
<TE>   Yes, it was just your average, outrageous New York evening where
everybody made out--yet barely a kiss was exchanged. The city's most
cutting-edge museum buddied up with its fanciest department store.
Uptown met downtown. Art mixed with commerce. Artistes and artisans
collaborated--although mostly by fax and through "their people."
Young and old jammed together to suck oysters off the half-shell and
lounge on rust-colored velvet couches in a shoe salon so lush it
looked like a Victorian boudoir.</TE>
<TE>   And, by evening's end, a lot of people happily, graciously,
ravenously were shaken down.</TE>
<TE>   "We bought them, we bought them," squealed Sunny Goldberg, a New
Museum trustee, waving her size 8 red spikes designed by New York
photographer Laurie Simmons and crafted by Bernard Figueroa, a New
York shoeman. But are they art or will she wear them?</TE>
<TE>   "Oh, both," Goldberg said, whipping off her sunglasses and smiling
wisely. "They'll be what we want them to be."</TE>
<TE>   Goldberg, who lives with her money-manager husband in an
art-filled mansion in the suburbs, explained that she is a size 7 1/2
and her daughter Lilli, a social worker, is an 8 1/2.</TE>
<TE>   "We'll share our 8!" mother and daughter said in stereo.</TE>
<TE>   Simmons seemed overwhelmed by all the attention she and her
red-satin spikes were getting--and unsure of what she had created.
"It's one of those crazy things artists get to do," she said. "But
this is not the real thing."</TE>
<TE>   Simmons also brought her daughter Grace, 10, who clearly
understood why her mom's design was so popular, and why eight pairs
sold. "I think my mom's are gorgeous," said Grace. "I think a lot of
the others are a little too crazy and not practical."</TE>
<TE>   Some shoes really were over-the-top, like New York artist Jeff
Koon's collaboration with Italian designer Andrea Pfister. It was a
boot with a woven-leather overlay, topped with an inflatable cuff. It
got so complicated to produce that there were none available
Wednesday night but two were special-ordered Thursday. It seems that
getting turtle-shaped inflatable shoe ornaments was too difficult
anywhere but in London or maybe China. It was impossible to get them
to Bergdorf's by 7 p.m. Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   "We only started planning for this benefit in April," said Ann
Livet, the wizard-ess consultant whose idea it was to match her
oddball clients, the museum and the store. It also became her job to
marry busy artists and shoe designers in their different time zones
and mind sets.</TE>
<TE>   "You'd be amazed how short six months is," Livet said.</TE>
<TE>   George Malkemus, president of Manolo Blahnik USA, said his boss
had no pretensions about this project. "Manolo doesn't see himself as
an artist. He says, 'I'm a craftsperson, a factory maker. I'll listen
to the artist.' " But he was weirded out when he was paired with
Damien Hirst, once called the "hooligan genius" of British art.</TE>
<TE>   "Manolo thought, 'Oh my God. Am I going to be dipping sheep in
formaldehyde?' " Malkemus said.</TE>
<TE>   But then, even though they both live in London, Hirst's people
faxed Blahnik's people examples of the artist's classic motifs--spin
art and polka dots. And the shoemaker put each motif on a classic
Blahnik ankle boot. The boots sold like hot cakes, at $1,200 a pair.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a combination of the simplest ideas that sometimes works the
best," said Malkemus, who was unsurprised that the Metropolitan
Museum of Art in New York had bought a pair of the polka-dotted boots
for its permanent collection. "The biggest appreciator of shoes in
the world are New York women," Malkemus said.</TE>
<TE>   Hooey to that, insisted Nell Campbell, a co-chairwoman of the
event, which was called Art + Sole. "All women have shoe fetishes,"
the New York nightclub owner said, categorizing herself as a
collector of slippers. Wednesday night, she was wearing her favorite
thongs studded with dangling rhinestone stars. But in an interview at
the event's peak--about 450 people elbowed their way to bars set up
between shoe displays--Campbell took a swipe at the L.A. woman's
comprehension of true shoe love.</TE>
<TE>   "We New York women," announced Campbell, who was born in England,
"have to actually walk in our shoes. Unlike those L.A. babes. They're
always getting in and out of their Mercedes. What do they know? We
know shoe pain. We know shoes."</TE>
<TE>   Still, Los Angeles artist Liza Lu, who was among this week's
recipients of MacArthur Foundation "genius" grants, tugged at New
Yorkers' purses with her collaboration with Diana Broussard. They
reinvented the cashmere-sock, demi-boot by covering it with an
intricate bead design.</TE>
<TE>   Jerry Saltz, the Village Voice art critic, studied the shoe
displays and said: "I'm a straight man. I have nothing to say about
shoes. I just love the New Museum, which is why I am here."</TE>
<TE>   The incongruities grew more exaggerated as the night wore on. Many
downtowners felt out of place. There were young art dealers and
museum groupies who had never set foot before in uptown Bergdorf's.</TE>
<TE>   As for the store, its proprietors were delighted at the potential
for new customers and had even recruited "performers" to appeal to
the downtown crowd. Drag queen Joey Arias appeared as Imelda Marcos
and looked lost on a velvet throne on the edge of the salon.</TE>
<TE>   And, of course, what shoe party would be complete without Dorothy
in her ruby-red slippers, except this model was bedecked in tattoos
and slung a live Toto in a $1,500 basket-shaped pocketbook.</TE>
<TE>   Artist Adele Lutz admitted she doesn't venture this far uptown but
enjoyed the eclectic event. "It was fun," she said Thursday morning.
Lutz and shoemaker Walter Steiger had produced a brown "ponyboot"
complete with a horse's tail. The Met also bought one of theirs.</TE>
<TE>   Lutz said she and Simmons had admitted to each other at the party
that they were surprised at how obsessed they had become by their
shoe design project. "I'm glad I can finally get back to my work,"
she said. "You know, to art."</TE>

<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>There's something seductive about a fashion show-- models bathed in
warm spotlights, feel-good music throbbing, cameras clicking and the
unmistakable allure of the new. Like all fantasies, runway shows look
effortless but the 20 minutes of fashion euphoria takes weeks of
preparations.</LD>
<LD>   After models are cast, clothing is fitted, music is mixed, invites
are mailed and programs printed, the big day arrives. In the hours
before a show begins, the clothes are tested with the runway lighting
to make sure the colors look right, there are sound checks and
walk-throughs. Photographers arrive early to claim spots on risers at
the end of the runway. Those from big publications have assigned
spots, but freelancers have to jockey for spaces on the sidelines.</LD>
<LD>   Backstage, an army of makeup and hairstylists assembles. Hanging
on rolling clothing rods, outfits (often put together by an outside
stylist instead of the designer) are numbered and labeled with the
names of the models who will wear them. Assistants finish any
last-minute sewing and tape the soles of shoes so models won't slip.
Sometimes, designers hang poster boards emblazoned with inspirational
buzzwords for models such as "smile" and "be sexy." Since top names
such as Alek Wek and Sophie Dahl can be booked for shows back-to-back
in venues all over the city, they often arrive with just enough time
to be coiffed and powdered.</LD>
<TE>   In the house, guests take their seats and try to appear
nonchalant, especially if there's a goodie bag involved. (Any
excitement, particularly in the front row, is frowned upon.) As the
minutes tick by, seat jockeying becomes more aggressive, with those
in back rows hoping to score seats closer to the runway.
Photographers busy themselves by stalking the front row for anyone
with a whiff of celebrity (from Joan Collins at Patricia Field to
Elizabeth Hurley at Ralph Lauren), then engulfing them in a pack of
flashbulbs and lenses.</TE>
<TE>   Publicists scurry around (headphones and frenzied look required)
consulting seating charts, busting squatters and sometimes resorting
to sitting in front-row seats themselves to protect them. (Such was
the case at Luella Bartley when seats and the show were held for
French Vogue editor Carine Roitfield and photographer Mario Testino,
who were stuck in traffic.</TE>
<TE>   And finally, when you think you can't stand to wait another
moment, the house lights go down, the music starts and finally (half
an hour after the appointed starting time, if you're lucky), the
first model stomps out onto the runway wearing a killer outfit and an
expression that says, "Are you kidding? This is a cakewalk."</TE>

<LD>"Some of you have asked for a list of topics so you can add other
chapters to your autobiographies. I'll write them on the board," the
teacher told the class.</LD>
<LD>   She wrote: "Homes I've Lived In, Holidays and Celebrations,
Friends, Pets, Accidents, Hobbies, Clubs, Travel &amp; Trips, Favorite
Toys, Future Career Plans, Frightening Experiences, Embarrassing
Moments, Private Lessons, Punishments, etc."</LD>
<LD>   Rhonda turned to Tonya and said, "I've been working like crazy

<TE>   "Yeah, me too," Tonya said. "Why didn't she tell us that in the
beginning?"</TE>
<TE>   "I dare you to ask her," Rhonda replied.</TE>
<TE>   Tonya approached the teacher. "Did you know we were doing this for
Back to School Night?" she asked.</TE>
<TE>   "No, but when I saw the beautiful bulletin boards and everyone's
enthusiasm, I knew we had to somehow share it with others. Now it's
my desire to urge you to keep adding every year of your life to your
autobiography."</TE>
<TE>   "Read more from your booklet," a group pleaded.</TE>
<TE>   The teacher read, "Halloween was my favorite holiday. Some people
gave handfuls of peanuts in the shell. My mom would shell them, crush
them, mix them with white frosting and cover small squares of white
cake with the mixture.</TE>
<TE>   "For fun, all the kids in the neighborhood played Kick the Can and
Run, My Good Sheep, Run. As a punishment for quarreling with my
brother and refusing to do chores, my mom made me stay in the house
watching all the other kids playing outside. That hurt me more than a
spanking and made me shape up in a hurry."</TE>
<TE>   The more the teacher read, the more questions the class had about
her life.</TE>

<HD>Talking of Sanity in 'Crazy as Hell'</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KEVIN THOMAS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"Crazy as Hell" is as ambitious as it is ponderous, a psychological
drama in which a controversial psychiatrist takes up temporary
residence in a state mental institution as part of a documentary
project, only to start questioning his own sanity. It marks a
vigorous directorial debut by Eriq La Salle, who, as is often the
case with actors-turned-directors, guides his large cast with
considerable skill and flair.</LD>
<LD>   The film is based on Jeremy Leven's 700-page novel "Satan: His
Psychotherapy and Cure by the Unfortunate Dr. Kassler, J.S.P.S.," and
while Leven, with the help of Erik Jendresen, whittled the book down
to a less-than-two-hour movie, it is still too talky to be as
effective on the screen as it might have been.</LD>
<LD>   Michael Beach stars as the polished Dr. Ty Adams, who has won both
supporters and detractors for his non-medicinal approach to therapy.
An eager-beaver documentarian named Parker (John C. McGinley) has
persuaded the doctor to agree to be on camera constantly for two
weeks at a vast psychiatric hospital to reveal the doctor's and
patients' effect on each other. The director of the institution, Dr.
Sam Delazo (Ronny Cox), makes it plain he's no admirer of Adams and
his approach, but he agrees to go along with Parker's idea.</LD>
<TE>   Dr. Adams, who comes on as a brash, confident man, arrives with a
sizable Achilles' heel: He is haunted by the deaths of his wife and
small daughter.</TE>
<TE>   The notion that Adams would attempt to take some patients off
their medications is daunting, but he is unsettled by the arrival of
an intelligent, physically imposing man (La Salle) who declares that
he is no less than Satan himself and that he's seeking enlightenment.</TE>
<TE>   He is smooth, insinuating and perceptive, raising the tantalizing
possibility that he really is the devil. Situations develop and
tension builds, engulfing Adams, in whom pride surely looks to go
before a fall.</TE>
<TE>   "Crazy as Hell" starts encouragingly and finishes strongly with a
twist, but the middle is weighed down by too much discourse when it
should be visually evoking its ideas and developing its mood of
unease.</TE>
<TE>   Sinbad heads a distinctive supporting cast as an alert and wise
orderly who is eager to counsel Adams.</TE>
<TE>   Despite its flaws, "Crazy as Hell" marks an encouraging new
direction for La Salle, a three-time Emmy nominee for his portrayal
of "ER's" Dr. Peter Benton.</TE>
<TE>   MPAA rating: R, for some strong sexual content, violent images and
language. Times guidelines: intense and violent.</TE>

<HD>Rhett Miller Steps Beyond His Old 97's Niche</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE APPLEFORD</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Rhett Miller is no quitter, not yet anyway. Which makes his new solo
career less about discarding his band, Old 97's, than about making a
calculated move to finally get his fine, nervous, romantic songs to a
wider pop audience.</LD>
<LD>   "I'm in a band called Old 97's," he declared Tuesday during his
show at the Troubadour, pointedly using the present tense. He knows
the band is far from a spent force, with its last album, "Satellite
Rides," possibly its best. But despite a devoted following, Old 97's'
sales are not the kind to brighten a label's boardroom.</LD>
<LD>   So Miller is poised to maybe move from college-radio troubadour to
dorm-room pinup, one with more staying power than, say, Evan Dando.
It's a role that fit Miller easily at the Troubadour, where he mixed
words of troubled romance with excited windmill strumming on his
acoustic guitar.</LD>
<TE>   "I believe in love, but it don't believe in me," he sang during
the Old 97's' "Rollerskate Skinny." His new songs cut just as deeply,
both sad and joyous, infinitely wilder than those offered by such hit
newcomers as folk-rock jazzbo John Mayer.</TE>
<TE>   In Miller's acoustic performance at Largo earlier this month, that
came through in a rough, casual way, bolstered only briefly by the
keyboards of Jon Brion, who produced Miller's solo debut, "The
Instigator." With a full band on Tuesday, "Things That Disappear" and
"Point Shirley" were fully realized pop that still revealed the
bristling punk rocker at Miller's core.</TE>
<TE>   Fired up with nervous energy, Miller was best when anxious, sad
and hopeful, drenched with sweat and bouncing on his heels, before
signing off after nearly 90 minutes with a fitting Pete Townshend
leap.</TE>

<HD>Guns N' Roses Returns to the Jungle</HD>
<DH>Pop Music* Founding member Axl Rose will lead a new lineup
on band's first North American tour in nine years.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GEOFF BOUCHER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Axl Rose, the long-lost bad boy of metal, will return in early
November with a reconstituted Guns N' Roses for the band's first
North American tour in nine years, although the status of the group's
oft-promised new album remains uncertain.</LD>
<LD>   The Guns N' Roses of 2002, scheduled to kick off an arena tour
with a Nov. 7 performance in Vancouver, Canada, is far removed from
the volatile rock outfit that first rattled the scene in
1985--frontman Rose is the only founding member still on board. No
California dates have been announced, but they are expected.</LD>
<LD>   After Rose, the only "old" member still in the mix is Dizzy Reed,
who joined Guns N' Roses during the making of "Use Your Illusion 1"
and "Use Your Illusion 2." Those 1991 simultaneous releases, along
with the mega-selling 1987 album "Appetite for Destruction," were the
most potent moments in the band's relatively meager recording output,
but the group's searing live performance and allegiance to reckless
rock at a time of antiseptic pop made them among that era's most
memorable music forces.</LD>
<TE>   The caterwauling Rose has become a reclusive figure in recent
years, and his seemingly endless toils on the next Guns N' Roses
album, "Chinese Democracy," had many fans skeptical they would ever
actually hear the music. An Interscope Records staffer said Thursday
that the album is not on the label's schedule of pending releases.</TE>
<TE>   The new lineup boasts three guitarists: Robin Finck (Nine Inch
Nails), the cartoonish virtuoso Buckethead and Richard Fortus (Love
Spit Love). Also on board are bassist Tommy Stinson (the
Replacements), drummer Brian "Brain" Mantia (Primus) and keyboardist
Chris Pitman (the Replicants).</TE>
<TE>   The group is coming off six dates in Asia and Europe, and it has
been playing new material, presumably from "Chinese Democracy," as
well as the familiar hits.</TE>

<HD>Nostalgia Glows in 'Tintypes'</HD>
<DH>Rubicon Theatre revives a revue celebrating Stephen Foster,
John Philip Sousa, Scott Joplin and others.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PHILIP BRANDES</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Where so many musical revues focus on retrospectives of particular
composers or genres, "Tintypes" tackles a more expansive theme: the
birth of the modern American spirit, as reflected in popular songs
from the turn of the 20th century.</LD>
<LD>   Exploring that pivotal era through music was a shrewd choice on
the part of Mary Kyte, Mel Marvin and Gary Pearle, who created
"Tintypes" in 1980. Even when the more familiar tunes raise the
specter of cliche, Broadway-caliber voices from an ensemble keep the
piece fresh and resonant in Bonnie Hellman's handsomely staged
revival for Ventura's Rubicon Theatre.</LD>
<LD>   An ensemble rendition of George M. Cohan's "The Yankee Doodle Boy"
frames this plunge into post-industrial sensibilities expressed in
works by Stephen Foster, John Philip Sousa, Scott Joplin and others.
In subjects spanning politics to courtship to entertainment, the
mind-set is recognizably modern. Yet there's a charming innocence in
the songs' awe and wonder at possibilities opened up by revolutionary
technology ("Electricity"), mobility ("Meet Me in St. Louis") and
changing social values ("It's Delightful to Be Married!").</LD>
<TE>   The expansiveness of the American theme presents inherent
structural challenges. To enhance continuity, each of the five
performers has a recurring primary character, along with supplemental
roles as needed for narrative embellishment. Opening the evening on a
whimsical note, Eric J. Olson's Russian Jew epitomizes the foibles,
obstacles and opportunities facing the immigrant population that
shaped our society during the last century; his comic timing helps
redeem the second act's overly long vaudeville salute.</TE>
<TE>   As an archetypal first-generation free-born black American woman,
"Ragtime" veteran Darlesia Cearcy appropriately belts out Joplin's
"The Ragtime Dance"; through sheer inflection, her renditions of
"Nobody" and "Sometimes I Feel Like a Motherless Child" ache with the
fresh wounds of slavery and a piercing reminder of how far short
we've fallen on the race question to this day.</TE>
<TE>   Three of the primary roles are actual historical figures. As Anna
Held, the showgirl who married Flo Ziegfeld, Heather Lee's
classically nuanced soprano puts witty spins on songs about
seduction, marriage and the age-old battle of the sexes.</TE>
<TE>   Tackling the thorny problems of the labor class in "Wait for the
Wagon," baritone Greg Zerkle's strutting Theodore Roosevelt radiates
indefatigable exuberance as he squares off against Sammy Fishman's
firebrand anarchist Emma Goldman, herself a recurring figure in
musicals dealing with the period (including "Ragtime"). Not addressed
here is the historical curiosity that Goldman's speech in Buffalo
inspired the disgruntled factory worker whose shooting of William
McKinley put Roosevelt in the White House--a darker connection
explored in Stephen Sondheim's "Assassins," which also enjoyed a
recent revival at the Knightsbridge Theatre (also coincidentally, the
same Sousa march used as Teddy's theme here provides the score for
the "Assassins" sequence about the attempt on Franklin Roosevelt's
life).</TE>
<TE>   "Tintypes" soft-pedals the darker side of Americana, focusing
instead on a more inspirational portrait engagingly rendered by a
talented cast.</TE>
<TE>   "Tintypes," Laurel Theatre, 1006 E. Main St., Ventura.
Wednesdays-Fridays, 8 p.m.; Saturdays, 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays, 2 p.m.
Ends Oct. 20. $28-$43. (805) 667-2900. Running time: 2 hours, 15

<LD>Just 4 1/2 years ago, Nic Harcourt was happily running a small
station in Woodstock, N.Y., living on seven acres atop a mountain,
and unsure that he wanted to accept the offer to move to Los Angeles
and oversee the music at KCRW-FM (89.9).</LD>
<LD>   But--because he said he never wanted to ask himself, "what
if?"--he accepted the job from general manager Ruth Seymour, took
over the music show "Morning Becomes Eclectic," and has expanded the
visibility and influence of the program and the station alike.</LD>
<LD>   "Since Nic has been in Los Angeles, the show has become more
sophisticated, more open to different kinds of music," Seymour said
of the program, which airs weekdays from 9 a.m. to noon, and which
takes in more money during pledge drives than all other shows on the
public station. And with its exposure on the World Wide Web and other
venues, she said, the show and the bands that Harcourt plays are
reaching far beyond KCRW's signal area.</LD>
<TE>   On Tuesday, the seventh compilation CD of songs from his program,
"Sounds Eclectic Too," went on sale, with live performances by Dido,
R.E.M. and Norah Jones, and proceeds benefiting the station.</TE>
<TE>   On Saturday, Harcourt hosts "Unsigned Indies," the station's
second annual concert of local unsigned bands, scheduled for 5 to 7
p.m. at Town Center Park in Costa Mesa.</TE>
<TE>   His two-hour weekly program, "Sounds Eclectic," featuring the best
of the KCRW show, is syndicated to about 30 stations nationwide,
including stations in Seattle, Philadelphia, Baltimore and Portland,
Ore. Its 100th episode airs Sunday at 6 p.m. on KCRW.</TE>
<TE>   The first major film for which he supervised the music, "Igby Goes
Down," is in wide release, featuring songs from "Morning Becomes
Eclectic" regulars Coldplay, Travis and the Dandy Warhols.</TE>
<TE>   And Nissan even hired Harcourt to emcee a compact disc of
alternative artists that the company gives out with new cars and
promotional materials.</TE>
<TE>   In less than five years, he's gone from "Nic who?" to Nic Inc.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm totally overworked. I look at my calendar, and it's like, 'Oh
my God, how did I create all this?' " Harcourt said this week. He and
his staff look at their schedules and realize, "We can't do it all.
You always want to please, but at the end of the day, there's only so
much you can do."</TE>
<TE>   But what drives him is his desire to expose an ever-expanding
audience to the music he thinks is worthwhile.</TE>
<TE>   "There's a passion for spreading the word, in whatever way you
can," he said.</TE>
<TE>   And because the show broadcasts to L.A., where so much of the
entertainment industry is based, Seymour said, the program is "a
taste maker, and that was never more true than it is now."</TE>
<TE>   Million-seller Coldplay made its first radio appearance on
"Morning Becomes Eclectic." Pop chanteuse Dido was on the program six
months before her first record came out, and a year-and-a-half before
the rest of the country heard of her. Her song "Here With Me" became
the theme song for the WB network's "Roswell" after executives heard
it on "Morning Becomes Eclectic." David Gray didn't even have a
record deal when Harcourt heard something that he thought was special
and put him on the air.</TE>
<TE>   "I have the best job in radio. I get to play the music that I find
attractive," Harcourt said.</TE>
<TE>   The show--under previous hosts Tom Schnabel and Chris Douridas,
who each left for higher-paying, higher-profile jobs--was already
well-regarded, and well-known among music cognoscenti. But Harcourt
discovered that "Morning Becomes Eclectic" and even KCRW itself were
invisible to many outside the station. He wanted to bring KCRW out of
the basement and into the community.</TE>
<TE>   "If we're true to what we say we are, hip and cutting-edge, let's
go find some of that rather than waiting for the mail to arrive," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   So, KCRW began presenting five to 10 concerts a year, starting
with Morcheeba in August 1998.</TE>
<TE>   Harcourt said that he receives about 200 CDs a week and that he
listens to every one--although many get only a few seconds before he
knows they won't make the station's library of 50,000 discs. Only
about 5% make the cut.</TE>
<TE>   "I wish I could play every demo that gets to the building," he
said, but not all of it is good, and a show that simply regurgitated
everything the station received would shrink its audience very
quickly. "This is a professional operation. It's important to have an
audience that can sustain the station.</TE>
<TE>   "I feel a responsibility, when these CDs come to me, to listen to
them," he said. He goes through as much as he can during the week,
but he may spend four hours on a Saturday night culling the rest.</TE>
<TE>   "Within all those pieces of plastic, you find a piece of music
that touches you, that makes it all worthwhile. You really have to
retain that sense of discovery," he said. The piles of CDs in mail
crates in his office may be daunting, "but that's where the gold is."</TE>
<TE>   Harcourt, 45, a native of Birmingham, England, who moved to New
York state from Australia 14 years ago, works in a light-filled
bungalow across from the Santa Monica College campus, where KCRW's
studios reside in the basement of the arts building. In his office,
filled with crates of CDs yet to be heard, and a massive reproduction
of the "Abbey Road" album cover, autographed by the Beatles, are
posters signed by artists that he's showcased on his program, such as
Coldplay and Kasey Chambers, with their thanks for exposing their
music to an appreciative audience.</TE>
<TE>   "The real rewards come from the e-mails," Harcourt said, from
listeners saying that they were touched by a certain set of songs
when they were having a good or bad time, or that they discovered
their new favorite band. "They let you know how much more it is than
playing records on the radio."</TE>

<LD>In the new romantic comedy "Sweet Home Alabama," Reese Witherspoon
plays Melanie Carmichael, a hot New York fashion designer who, on the
night of her debut collection, is whisked off to Tiffany's for a
marriage proposal. Her boyfriend (who's the mayor's son) pops the
question amid stacks of robin-blue boxes and a cortege of smiling
staff weighed down with treasure. Melanie beams, accepts, then
pounces on a diamond bigger than the Ritz and the Plaza put together.
She may be a romantic, but she knows good value, which is why she's
soon headed south of the Mason-Dixon Line, returning to her humble
past to divorce the hick she left behind.</LD>
<TE>   If movies were anything like life (and her ghastly collection
anything like fashion), Melanie would be already divorced and weeping
into her Women's Wear Daily. Instead, the day after her runway
triumph, this Dixie Holly Golightly is driving through her hometown
of Pigeon Creek, Ala., with a look of such unmitigated horror you'd
think she'd taken a wrong turn into a John Waters trailer park.
What's strange about her reaction is, although it's missing the usual
complement of retail citadels and junk-food chains, her former home
looks a lot like any number of American towns you pass on the
interstate. There may be a Confederate flag or two aloft and a
conspicuous absence of black residents, but the white people seem
pleasant enough. Even if they listen to the Charlie Daniels Band,
everyone has a forehead.</TE>
<TE>   Great comedy can be had from putting the wrong person in the wrong
place, but so can great condescension. Hollywood loves making movies
about the joys of small-town life--but you get the feeling that the
people making these movies wouldn't be caught dead (or alive)
anywhere but Beverly Hills. (They love the idea of whistle-stop
provincialism, not its reality.) In "Sweet Home Alabama," the big
joke is that the couturier who's stormed the big city originated from
a small town where she once pledged everlasting love to the boy next
door. Her big lesson, of course, is that there's no place like home.
But because no one involved in this film actually believes tipping
cows is preferable to tipping at Babbo, she learns that lesson while
holding her nose.</TE>
<TE>   Soon after reaching Pigeon Creek, Melanie tracks down her husband,
Jake (Josh Lucas). Pulling up to his house, one of those shabbily
chic movie shacks that looks like it would fetch upward of a million
dollars in Laurel Canyon, she begins waving a sheaf of divorce papers
and demanding her freedom. She's still wearing the same sour look she
drove in with, but as Melanie takes in the howling bloodhound, the
art-directed clutter and the engine grease smudged over her husband's
face, something else begins tugging at the corners of her mouth. The
sourness turns to disdain, then shades into full-on disgust. It isn't
just Pigeon Creek, the South or the inopportune husband that's
scraping at her so insistently--it's the poverty.</TE>
<TE>   Forced to stay put in Pigeon Creek, Melanie cuts a careless swath
through family and friends, her every insult played for laughs. When
she brags to a childhood friend that she's a designer and the woman
eagerly asks if she knows Jaclyn Smith, the Charlie's Angel turned
Kmart fashionista, the joke is on the woman betraying her ignorance,
not the one betraying her snobbism. Of course it's easy to knock
other people's taste; it's also convenient, especially if the digs
obscure more precarious topics. The film may be named for a Lynyrd
Skynyrd rebel yell, and the locals may dress in Civil War drag to
play war games, but that's meant to be just atmosphere, like the
Confederate flag pillow on the family couch and the black friend who
playfully dubs Melanie his "steel magnolia."</TE>
<TE>   Witherspoon has charmed her way through weak material before, but
she's too inexperienced to save the character from director Andy
Tennant, whose main achievement here is to turn his star's natural
twinkling menace into malice. (If the older cast members fare better,
it's because they're either storming the scenery, like Candice
Bergen, or in on some private joke, like Fred Ward.) Then again, it's
hard to imagine what a more seasoned performer could do with a woman
so consumed with her own narcissism that she purposely outs a
closeted male friend at a local bar because, as Melanie later
explains, she didn't want anyone noticing her bad behavior.</TE>
<TE>   The South takes another beating in "Sweet Home Alabama," but
that's nothing compared with the one conferred on the sweetheart
personality of its pint-sized Gen. Sherman.</TE>

<HD>The Battle of the Sexes Is Waged With One-Liners</HD>
<DH>Laughs, if not revelations, greet 'The Male Intellect: an
oxymoron?' as Robert Dubac tries to figure out what women really
want.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LYNNE HEFFLEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Men think; women feel.</LD>
<LD>   Give that a knee-jerk hiss, sister, and you've just proved it's
true.</LD>
<LD>   Just kidding. The gender jokes, which don't get much deeper or
more caustic than that, are delivered with the balm of equality in
Robert Dubac's naughty-nice comedy for adults, "The Male Intellect:
an oxymoron?," in which men come in for their own goodly share of
tongue-in-cheek abuse.</LD>
<TE>   In this long-running, nationally touring solo show, making a stop
at the Wilshire Theatre, Dubac, with dubious help from his five
chauvinistic alter egos, struggles to figure out what women really
want from men. He's got a personal stake in it: His fiancee has taken
what might be a permanent hiatus from their relationship and he's
desperate to patch it up. She was going to call him in two weeks;
he's got about 90 minutes before time's up.</TE>
<TE>   And all he'd said to her--no, really--was that he needed more
space ... from her cat.</TE>
<TE>   Perplexed and a tad defensive, Dubac doesn't get much help from a
pile of self-help books; he can barely lift "The Male Ego."</TE>
<TE>   Next stop on his quest is his own brain. The feminine half (voiced
by Dubac's real-life wife, Lauren Sinclair) is represented on one
side of the stage by a blank chalkboard, awaiting any words of wisdom
he may stumble across; on the other side, the masculine hemisphere is
a "Man Show" mess of beer bottles, dirty laundry, a couch and TV,
food wrappers and a pull-down poster photo of a sexy former
girlfriend.</TE>
<TE>   From here on, the show is a series of one-liners--"men and women
have the same vocabulary but different dictionaries"--and connected
anecdotes told by Dubac as himself and his stereotypical alter egos:
the Colonel, who's a jerk and proud of it; oozing French charmer
Jean-Michel; 123-year-old Mr. Linger, kept alive by his wait for the
perfect woman, an elusive mermaid; the Jack Nicholson-channeling
self-proclaimed "pig," Fast Eddie; and tough but romantic Brooklynite
Ronnie Cabrezzi, who has trouble decoding his girlfriend's use of a
certain expletive as noun, verb and adjective.</TE>
<TE>   Despite their macho cluelessness, each does lead Dubac toward just
barely understanding what women might actually want in a
relationship, as he writes the answers on the chalkboard. That the
flip side of said chalkboard is covered with such hard-to-erase and
equally stereotypical male characteristics as fear of commitment, the
Three Stooges and rude noises gives Dubac more fix-it work to do.</TE>
<TE>   Dubac never ventures beyond the shallow into new or original
depths with his narrowly focused material, but his assured theatrical
chops and air of genuine anguish get him past a few ho-hum spots and
less than witty crudities to elicit big laughs from both sexes,
together and in waves of treble and bass.</TE>
<TE>   There's a sneaky second payoff, too, after the hilarious sight-gag
highlight that ostensibly ends the show. It comes when it all seems
to be over, so don't leave too soon. For that matter, early female
arrivals especially should listen to the joke slyly tucked into the
pre-show music, sung to the tune of Bob Dylan's "Blowin' in the
Wind."</TE>
<TE>   "The Male Intellect: an oxymoron?," Wilshire Theatre, 8440
Wilshire Blvd., Beverly Hills, Tuesdays-Fridays, 8 p.m.; Saturdays, 2
and 8 p.m.; Sundays, 1 and 6:30 p.m. through Oct. 6. $35-$45. (213)

<SE></SE>
<AU>KEVIN THOMAS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Chung Gil-Chae's "Herapurple: Devil Goddess" is a lurid, lively and
eye-popping erotic Korean thriller of the supernatural that its maker
has explained was intended "to tear away and plow through any and all
[sexual] taboos in my country." In this tale about how the spirit of
the vengeful Greek goddess Hera happens to inhabit Hyerim (Chung
Kim), a beautiful, dutiful housewife with a daughter in college and a
son in high school, Chung fulfills his intention and then some.</LD>
<LD>   A skilled and dynamic filmmaker, Chung, who also plays Hyerim's
husband, draws upon a potent pretext: an all-out attack on the
ancient oppression and exploitation of Asian women by men and the
cult of machismo that drives it on. Although this may seem an
admirable target, Chung exploits it to the hilt, cramming into a
93-minute running time as many intense and remarkably athletic sexual
bouts as he can, graphic and right up to the edge of hard-core porn.
The result is an amusingly outrageous entertainment strictly for
sophisticated adults.</LD>
<LD>   Poor Hyerim has become so tormented by nightmares that she has
sought help from a psychiatrist (Lee Ho-Sung).</LD>
<TE>   When conventional therapy fails, he tries hypnosis, unleashing
Hera within Hyerim upon a series of young men, seducing them to
unparalleled heights of ecstasy for which they inevitably pay with
their lives.</TE>
<TE>   A young police detective (Lee Se-Chang) with an unexpected tie to
Hera, investigating the mysterious serial killings, strives to
uncover the reason for them.</TE>
<TE>   Even should the detective and his team succeed, a big question
remains as to whether they will be able to bring the murders to an
end.</TE>
<TE>   Unrated. Times guidelines: Much nudity, explicit sex and
considerable though reasonably discreet violence. Strictly for
sophisticated adults.</TE>

<HD>Nirvana's Final Song Surfaces</HD>
<DH>Pop Music* Its last song with Kurt Cobain appears,
unauthorized, on the Internet and on radio.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE HOCHMAN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Nirvana's final completed recording, "You Know You're Right," has
gained mythic status during the eight years it has remained
officially unreleased.</LD>
<LD>   Now the recording has surfaced, unauthorized--first on Internet
file-sharing services and this week on radio. In Los Angeles, KROQ-FM
(106.7) played the song Monday and Tuesday, then received a
cease-and-desist order that a station spokesman says it is honoring
(though it was heard there again on Thursday).</LD>
<LD>   Even if the song is banished from the airwaves, the exposure it's
receiving will probably make its official release--presumably as part
of a Nirvana anthology release planned before
Christmas--anticlimactic.</LD>
<TE>   In any case, the song stands above the rock crowd as much today as
it would have eight years ago. With its insistently menacing two-note
figure and Kurt Cobain's deadpan delivery of his sarcastic lyrics of
self-recrimination and despair, it's perhaps too easy to hear the
song as a harbinger of his suicide, which came just four months after
the Seattle recording session: "Things have never been so swell / I
have never been so well," he sings, then screams, "Pain!"</TE>
<TE>   Interscope/Geffen Records officials will not comment about the
planned anthology, though reportedly it will be one CD rather than
the multi-disc set once planned for release a year ago.</TE>
<TE>   "You Know You're Right" has been part of the ugly legal wrangling
between Nirvana's two surviving members, Dave Grohl and Krist
Novoselic, and Cobain's widow, Courtney Love, but the scheduling of
the anthology suggests that recent reports of a settlement are
accurate.</TE>
<TE>   Love said last week on Howard Stern's radio show that a settlement
had been reached, and according to a clerk in King County Superior
Court in Seattle, all previously scheduled hearings for the lawsuit
have been pulled from the calendar, further suggesting that a
settlement has been reached.</TE>
<TE>   An attorney for Grohl and Novoselic said Thursday that he could
not comment on the matter.</TE>

<HD>The People Pick Top 1,000 Movies</HD>
<DH>Books* The Zagat Survey turns its attention from
restaurants to films to find out which are rated the best. Sorry, Mr.
Kane, but you are only No. 8.</DH>

<LD>Call it the people's-choice film guide.</LD>
<LD>   Zagat Survey, one of the most trusted names in the field of
restaurant recommendations, has elbowed its way onto the shelf
alongside Leslie Halliwell, Leonard Maltin and Roger Ebert. The
esteemed surveyors have just produced their first "Zagat Survey Movie
Guide: 1,000 Top Films of All Time."</LD>
<LD>   The slim, silver-and-black volume (perfect for consulting in the
aisles of your local video store) offers descriptions of the 1,000
most popular films selected by a group of more than 5,000
nonprofessional voters whose quippy quotes are excerpted inside
capsule reviews. These are movie lovers who see at least two to three
films a week, and by most accounts, know what they are talking about.</LD>
<TE>   The book contains an impressive and diverse list of titles--from
Fellini's "Nights of Cabiria" ("one of Fellini's most moving and
least bizarre films") and Hitchcock's "North by Northwest" ("James
Bond, eat your heart out") to Akira Kurosawa's "Rashomon" ("superb,"
"head-twister"), Buster Keaton's "The General" ("one of the most
remarkable silent films"), John Ford's "The Searchers" ("a thinking
person's western"), David Lynch's "Mulholland Dr." ("another
confusing but consuming Lynch production"), Cameron Crowe's "Almost
Famous" ("almost perfect filmmaking") and Terry Zwigoff's "Ghost
World" ("a witty look at two nonconformist girls trapped in a
homogenized suburb").</TE>
<TE>   Films are listed in alphabetical order and cross-referenced under
categories including genre, decade and special feature with enough
subcategories in the latter (adults only, date movies, guy movies,
chick flicks, foreign films, rock 'n' roll, occupation, Oscar winners
by award, country of origin) to make you wish it had its own index.</TE>
<TE>   Each write-up includes U.S. release date, director and cast,
running time, rating, and particulars having to do with sequels,
subtitles and format availability.</TE>
<TE>   Films are given numerical ratings in four categories: "O" for
overall; "A" for acting; "S" for story; and "P" for production
values--with 30 amounting to perfection.</TE>
<TE>   The most popular movie among Zagat Survey voters was not Orson
Welles' "Citizen Kane," which usually crops up as No. 1 on many
critics' lists (it comes in at a respectable No. 8). Tops in the
people's choice guide is Francis Ford Coppola's "The Godfather,"
followed by Michael Curtiz's "Casablanca" and George Lucas' "Star
Wars."</TE>
<TE>   Not a bad start, but there are a few holes discernible even on
quick inspection.</TE>
<TE>   In rating the top 1,000 films, Zagat voters demonstrate their
shallow memory banks. Recent releases appear in disproportionate
numbers in the list of the Top 50 films that opens the book. "A
Beautiful Mind" comes in at No. 13, while "Blade Runner" rates No.
44. "When Harry Met Sally ... " is No. 12, while "The Sound of Music"
is down the list at No. 23 along with "Lawrence of Arabia" at No. 35.
"Memento," "Bridget Jones's Diary," and "Top Gun" make the list,
while films such as "Psycho," "The Third Man," "The Seventh Seal" and
"His Girl Friday" make the top 1,000 but not the top 50.</TE>
<TE>   A random search for some favorite titles finds Woody Allen's "Love
and Death," Stanley Kramer's "The Defiant Ones," Ingmar Bergman's
"Persona" and Spike Lee's "She's Gotta Have It" missing entirely,
while listings exist for pictures such as "The Mummy" and "Face/Off."</TE>
<TE>   More disappointing is that in, say, the Chick Flick category, the
voters made room for movies like "Ghost" and "Pretty Woman," but "The
Group," "Mrs. Miniver," "My Brilliant Career," "Entre Nous," "High
Tide" and "Dangerous Beauty" appear nowhere in the guide.</TE>
<TE>   But this is a people's guide, not a critic's guide.</TE>
<TE>   Even so, at $14.95, the "Zagat Survey Movie Guide" is a terrific
pocket source, a helpful, interesting, sure-to-produce-arguments
addition to any movie fan's library.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Although famously troubled, the LAPD continues to get great pub in
prime time.</LD>
<LD>   The wattage this time comes from "Robbery Homicide Division," a
gripping, street-raw, kick-butt new series that benefits from Tom
Sizemore's seething presence as a bulldog police lieutenant who works
L.A. murders. It's from Michael Mann, who got famous himself when
producing NBC's "Miami Vice" in the 1980s before directing such
features as "Heat," "The Insider" and "Ali."</LD>
<LD>   "Robbery Homicide Division" opens impressively on CBS tonight
following the 9 p.m. debut of "Hack," a drama of redemption about a
disgraced former Philadelphia cop who wears his guilt like a truss
while eking out a living as a taxi driver doing good deeds. The best
deed of all would be a major rewrite, for "Hack" is relentlessly
ordinary when not flat-out comical.</LD>
<TE>   Facing it on ABC is the premiere of "That Was Then," a really bad
hour of all-too-familiar drama about an unfulfilled 30-year-old who
awakens one morning to discover he's 16 again. The series has its own
zits, though.</TE>
<TE>   In other words, the best bet for drama at 9 Fridays remains the
intriguing amnesiac of Fox's new "John Doe."</TE>
<TE>   Sizemore's Sam Cole knows exactly who he is--a night animal on
L.A.'s mean streets in a series affirming crime as TV's cream. That's
been so for years, from NBC's "Homicide: Life on the Street" and
original "Law &amp; Order" and ABC's "NYPD Blue," to HBO's "The Sopranos"
and "The Wire" and Showtime's "Street Time." These created their own
golden age. As for crime-fighting lite, the USA Network's droll new
"Monk," with Tony Shalhoub as an obsessive-compulsive ex-cop who
solves cases with the help of his personal nurse, is rather terrific
too.</TE>
<TE>   Shootouts course through Mann's highly ethnic new CBS series, with
Asian gang violence over drugs driving the premiere and a cop killing
that mingles Asians and Latinos in Episode 2. The fluid camera work
in some of these death scenes is almost detached and in conflict with
the music track. Instead of softening, though, the technique
accentuates the madness and folly of these tragedies in an inky
atmosphere of body bags and teeming urban life.</TE>
<TE>   Charging through it all is Cole, one of those menacing, hot-glare
figures who intimidates by speaking to people right in their faces,
eyeball to eyeball, nose to nose. And always nearby are Barry
"Shabaka" Henley, Klea Scott and Michael Paul Chan as members of his
unit. They're an interesting group.</TE>
<TE>   Although the dialogue here is sharp, "Robbery Homicide Division"
plot threads are not always visible through the tangle of action and
atmosphere. The bulky Sizemore, moreover, runs as if he's still
wearing his full pack from "Saving Private Ryan." After playing one
of Al Pacino's criminal antagonists in "Heat," he appears to have
picked up that actor's distinctive speech patterns by osmosis. Yet he
and his series are first rate, promising more depth for prime-time
crime.</TE>
<TE>   Staying with David Morse and "Hack" even for an hour, though, is a
fare no one should have to pay. Part cabby, part cop, Morse is ...</TE>
<TE>   Cabbycop!</TE>
<TE>   In a scene featured in CBS promos, taxi driver Mike Olshansky
(Morse) saves a passenger from a savage beating by thugs after
dropping him off in a bad neighborhood at night.</TE>
<TE>   As the guy gets pounded, cut to big Mike, who has doubled back,
looking almost otherworldly while planted in front of his cab's
blazing headlights.</TE>
<TE>   Mike: "Somebody call a cab?"</TE>
<TE>   Thug: "No, man. Nobody called a cab."</TE>
<TE>   Mike: "Well, y'got one."</TE>
<TE>   Then the high jinks begin.</TE>
<TE>   It turns out that Olshansky was bounced from the Philly force for
pocketing recovered loot, causing even his little son to resent him,
and he's still bitter about it. "I took a bullet in the shoulder for
the city," he grouses over a drink. "What else did you take?" asks
his priest buddy (George Dzundza).</TE>
<TE>   This moral lapse notwithstanding, he cares about people, whose
problems gnaw at him.</TE>
<TE>   Mike's next passenger is a desperate father, in town to search for
his 18-year-old daughter who has disappeared. Mike doesn't care. He
doesn't want to hear about her. It's not his business, so don't
bother him. Let him alone, already. And especially, don't show him a
picture of the missing girl because he's got too many worries of his
own to get involved. Hey, didn't you hear? Don't show him that
picture. Put it away!</TE>
<TE>   Pause.</TE>
<TE>   "Lemme see that."</TE>
<TE>   Soon he's on the girl's trail, of course, with inside information
from one of TV's stock characters in crime-related stories. Yes, the
Cop Friend Who Reluctantly Helps Out Because He Owes the Hero a
Favor. Shackled to this lowly supporting role is that good actor who
deserves better, Andre Braugher.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Mike is full of self-pity and wallows in his misery.</TE>
<TE>   Enjoy.</TE>
<TE>   If "Hack" is bleak and austere, "That Was Then" spreads enough
warmth to fry an egg. It begins with adult Travis Green (James
Bulliard) getting a chance to alter his and other lives for the
better when he magically travels back through time to his sophomore
year in high school.</TE>
<TE>   This is a close cousin of the new WB sitcom "Do Over," and both
have roots in the theatrical films "Back to the Future" and "Peggy
Sue Got Married."</TE>
<TE>   Travis encounters the usual conflicts in hoping to rewrite
history. He wants to save a schoolmate from a fatal encounter with a
train, for example, and spare the girl he's stuck on, Claudia (Kiele
Sanchez), from a traumatic sexual encounter with his libidinous
brother, Gregg (Brad Raider), whom she later married.</TE>
<TE>   But nothing here works. For one thing, beaming back to 1988 is
hardly atmospheric to anybody older than 20. More fundamentally, this
is teenhood on Mars. What you get are kids who not only look about 10
years older than they're meant to be, but who also have adult
sensibilities. Lacking credibility even for a fantasy like this are
Claudia's intimate chat about her virginity with Travis and his with
his mother (Bess Armstrong) about an affair she's having. What's
more, Travis' obnoxious, ever-present best friend, Pinkus (Tyler
Labine), is just about unbearable.</TE>
<TE>   Tonight's most arresting character is Travis' father (Jeffrey
Tambor), who is cold and nasty when we first meet him. By the end of
Episode 2, however, he's turned warm and fuzzy, after changing skins
as only poorly written TV characters can do.</TE>
<TE>   "Robbery Homicide Division" will be shown at 10 p.m. Fridays on
CBS. The network has rated it TV-PGLV (may not be suitable for young
children, with advisories for coarse language and violence).</TE>
<TE>   "Hack" will be shown at 9 p.m. Fridays on CBS. The network has
rated it TV-PGLV (may not be suitable for young children, with

<TE>   "That Was Then" will be shown at 9 p.m. Fridays on ABC. The

<HD>In Bassist Holland's Little-Big Band, Continuity Fosters
Creativity</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DON HECKMAN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Bassist Dave Holland has had so many accomplishments in his long
career that no one should be surprised that he's recently taken on
yet another musical challenge: leading and writing for a big jazz
band. Not quite completely big, in the sense that the group he's
recorded with, and is now touring with, is 13 pieces, three or four
shy of the traditional full big jazz band instrumentation.</LD>
<LD>   On Thursday night, the Holland little-big band makes its West
Coast debut appearance at UCLA's Royce Hall, with most of the same
personnel as on the just-released, already critically praised ECM
recording, "What Goes Around."</LD>
<LD>   "There are a few players who couldn't make the tour because of
schedule conflicts," says Holland. "Mark Turner is replacing Chris
Potter, who's touring in support of his own new album [and appearing
at the Jazz Bakery through Sunday], and we have replacements for
trumpeter Earl Gardner, who's in the 'Saturday Night Live' band, and
Andre Hayward, who's working with the Lincoln Center Jazz Orchestra.
Otherwise, it's the same guys."</LD>
<TE>   Working with "the same guys" is something that has been important
to Holland since he first began leading his own groups in the early
'80s.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a premise that's always been important to me," he says, "to
keep a continuity of players as much as I can, because it gives us
the possibility of creating projects with some growth and
development.</TE>
<TE>   "Take recording, for example. We're planning to do a new album
with the big band in November. So what we're doing now is working out
the music on the road. It's a principle I've always used in my small
group recording: Go into the studio to record only after we've had a
chance to explore the music and mature it, to give it a chance to be
discovered and investigated. A musical conversation only starts with
the notes that you put on paper. After that, you have to start
getting into it, running with it, doing things with it to see where
it takes you."</TE>
<TE>   Holland's previous writing experience for a large group--his big
band consists of four saxophones, three trumpets, three trombones,
piano, vibes and drums, along with the leader's bass--was limited.
But by starting with the sort of harmonic textures and rhythmic flow
characteristic of his quintet, he has done a remarkable job of
maintaining a kind of small group freedom within a large ensemble
setting.</TE>
<TE>   "I really wanted to keep the flexibility of the quintet," he
explains. "The reason I'm not using a full 17-piece big band is
because I wanted more openness in the writing, so that even when I'm
using large orchestrated chords, there's still room inside, some
space in the harmony to give it a more open sound.</TE>
<TE>   "I also like to break the band down into smaller combinations,
with mixed voicings or with two or three instruments playing behind a
soloist and not just the usual brass-against-the-saxes kind of
sound."</TE>
<TE>   Holland's multifaceted career has provided plenty of opportunities
for him to sort out the musical directions that most appeal to him.
Working with both traditional jazz bands and avant-garde groups in
the early '60s in his native England, he replaced Ron Carter with the
Miles Davis group from 1968 to 1970, performing on, among other
items, the classic "Bitches Brew" session.</TE>
<TE>   Later associations included gigs with Chick Corea, Anthony
Braxton, Stan Getz, John Abercrombie, Jack DeJohnette, Steve Coleman,
Pat Metheny and Herbie Hancock.</TE>
<TE>   "I'll continue touring and recording with the quintet, of course,"
he says. "But working with this large group is the musical moment
I've been looking forward to. It's complicated and expensive to make
it happen, but it's worth it on a lot of counts. Musically, of
course. But also because of what happens inside the band.</TE>
<TE>   "One of the things I was determined to do was to mix the
generations in the personnel, not just have it be a one-dimensional
age sort of thing. Because I wanted the band to be both a musical and
a social arena, the kind of place that encourages the sharing that
goes on between musicians, the chance to talk about and to share in
the common goal of making music."</TE>

<TE>   Banjo Bop: There was a time when the banjo's only connection with
jazz reached back to the early days of New Orleans. Although it
continued to play a vital role in country and bluegrass, it was
replaced in jazz by the guitar after a decade or so.</TE>
<TE>   Until, that is, the arrival of Bela Fleck, whose work with his own
ensemble, the Flecktones, has not only reestablished the banjo as an
authentic jazz improvising instrument but also has placed it at the
music's youth-oriented cutting edge.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of people," says Fleck, "want to put us in the jam band
category, primarily because we're so often on concerts with people
like Dave Matthews and Phish.</TE>
<TE>   "And also, I guess, because that particular audience seems to like
us a lot.</TE>
<TE>   "But I like to feel that what we're doing is a little broader than
that and that we can have the same sort of appeal to bluegrass fans
or to jazz fans with open minds."</TE>
<TE>   Many of those fans will undoubtedly turn out at Royce Hall on
Wednesday, when Fleck and the Flecktones perform in one of the major
events in the Verizon Music Festival. And Fleck is pretty much on
target with his description of how varied that audience will be.</TE>
<TE>   He also recognizes that the diversity of his music, as well as his
audience, is not exactly what the category-driven record business
favors.</TE>
<TE>   "It's strange," he says, "like playing against type. But it's
always been our saving grace. It's kind of like the new record
contract we have with Columbia, which calls for us to do some
classical music.</TE>
<TE>   "The funny thing is that most classical acts these days are asked
to do crossover material to try to reach a wider audience. But with
us, the record company is perfectly happy to have us do
straight-ahead classical stuff. So go figure."</TE>
<TE>   The 44-year-old Fleck has been cruising through other styles since
he was dipping into bebop while attending New York's High School of
Music and Art. The Flecktones have been his primary musical vehicle
since the late '80s, when he left New Grass Revival to form his own
highly idiosyncratic ensemble with bassist Victor Wooten; his
brother, percussionist Roy "Future Man" Wooten (who performs on his
own unique invention, the Drumitar); and harmonica player Howard Levy
(who was eventually replaced by current member, saxophonist Jeff
Coffin).</TE>
<TE>   "It's turned out to be a situation that has worked well for
everyone," says Fleck.</TE>
<TE>   "Each of us pursues solo projects as well as working with the
Flecktones, and it works really well.</TE>
<TE>   "In a lot of bands, people feel threatened when individuals go out
and do their thing. But in our case, everybody's really happy to be
on the road with the band and still go out and do their own thing."</TE>
<TE>   Bela Fleck &amp; the Flecktones perform at UCLA's Royce Hall on
Wednesday at 8 p.m. Tickets: $40, $32, $25. (310) 825-2101.</TE>

<DH>The oddball trajectory of 'Lipstick Traces' runs from a
16th century heretic to 20th century punk rock</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>REED JOHNSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>History repeats itself: first as tragedy, then as farce, then as a
spitting, preening British punk rock quartet. In radically abridged
form, that's the exhilarating thesis that drove "Lipstick Traces,"
the 1989 cult-classic "secret history of the 20th century" by Greil
Marcus, the Claude Levi-Strauss of contemporary music critics.</LD>
<LD>   Did we say "history"? But what, exactly, is that? "Perhaps it's
getting the last word," proposes Malcolm McLaren, the Rasputin-like
London boutique owner and calculating impresario behind the Sex
Pistols, the proto-punk outfit whose ornery stage theatrics and
marginal technical competence failed to disguise its passion, raging
intelligence and notorious refusal to play by the rules of bloated,
self-important, mid-'70s corporate rock.</LD>
<LD>   In the breakneck, fitfully transcendent adaptation of Marcus' book
that's now tearing up the seats at UCLA's Macgowan Little Theater, it
only deepens the audience's amusement and moral turbulence that
McLaren is being played by the dandyish Henry Stram, walking a
mincing line between characterization and impersonation, as a cross
between P.T. Barnum and Oscar Wilde.</LD>
<TE>   And why not? If even rebellion can be turned into a commodity
under modern capitalism, why shouldn't the Malcolm McLarens of this
world make a fast buck off all the youthful fear and loathing hanging
out on Kings Road? Or Melrose Avenue, for that matter?</TE>
<TE>   Yet back, for a moment, to Marcus' book, whose splintered insights
and cut-and-paste aesthetic have been ingeniously captured in this
suitably self-subverting adaptation by the Rude Mechanicals ensemble
out of Austin, Texas (kudos to playwright-adapter Kirk Lynn).</TE>
<TE>   Lying flat on the printed page, "Lipstick Traces" is a big,
artfully unruly, semi-underground guide to mad-prophet role models
and the savage creativity spawned by civilization and its
discontents. Assembling a prismatic narrative out of misplaced
historical footnotes, bizarre convergences and sparkling,
philosophical prose, Marcus drew startling connections between
seemingly disjointed cultural occurrences and their compelling
frontmen.</TE>
<TE>   Free-associating with impunity, and minting aphorisms apparently
at will, "Lipstick Traces" charted a smeary, oddball trajectory from
the heretic preachings of 16th century priest John of Leyden, to the
anti-art pranksterism of the dadaist bad boys, to the neo-socialist
paradoxes of the student-led Situationist International, which
paralyzed France with a series of work stoppages in 1968.</TE>
<TE>   Cross-cutting with furious ambition, the Rude Mechs re-imagine
episodes from these transformative epochs with a witty
resourcefulness, enhanced by the simple, effective design team of
Darron West (sound), Brian Scott (lights) and Rachel Carr (costumes).
The show gets off to a smash-mouth start as Marcus' scholarly
stand-in, Dr. Narrator (Lana Lesley), grabs a mike and plays
analyst-hostess to the show's time-tripping dramatis personae.</TE>
<TE>   A sonic blast and a battery of stage lights usher in John of
Leyden (Darren Pettie), bellowing his gospel of permissive pleasures
like some millenarian rock god. In a flash, director Shawn Sides'
inventive staging whisks us to the Cabaret Voltaire, where the
dadaists vented their absurdist anger at a decadent Europe worn out
by World War I. Suggesting a lost episode of "Beyond the Fringe," the
scene is a scary, risible dance of sublimated violence and
vulnerability, given life by actors Pettie, Randolph Curtis Rand and
T. Ryder Smith, who's superbly menacing as dadaist poet Richard
Huelsenbeck.</TE>
<TE>   Finally--or, rather, elliptically, in the style of Marcus' riffing
revisionism--the show segues to the anarchic, off-key ravings of John
Lydon, a.k.a. Johnny Rotten, the Sex Pistols' coruscating lead
singer, well-played by a sneeringly charismatic Jason Liebrecht.</TE>
<TE>   Re-creating Rotten's (in)famous Sex Pistols "audition," when he
growled and slurred his way through Alice Cooper's "18," "Lipstick
Traces" suggests that what the dadaists were to spiritually bankrupt
Europe in 1920, the Sex Pistols were to a British nation that was
paralyzed in the late '70s by strikes, rising oil prices and a
pervasive cynicism about the shriveling of the promised good life.</TE>
<TE>   But never mind the bollocks. What gives this stage version its pop
and sting isn't just Marcus' provocative theorems, which the kinetic
six-member cast obligingly diagrams on a blackboard at one point.
Blurring by in 75 intermission-less minutes, "Lipstick Traces" is
always threatening to drop through the floor, to disintegrate into
its own slightly juvenile self-consciousness.</TE>
<TE>   Yet it stays aloft through its raw, unnerving energy, restless
idea-shuffling and a kind of brutally wistful poetry such as you
might encounter in an early Raymond Pettibon drawing. Sprinting, at
times, toward the brink of incoherence, the show escapes its
aggressive pedantry by leapfrogging backward over itself, leaving the
audience struggling to keep up.</TE>
<TE>   Needless to say, "Lipstick Traces" won't be everyone's pint of
strychnine-laced Guinness.</TE>
<TE>   But as Rotten might paraphrase Picasso, art is a lie that makes us
drink, fight, swear, puke, stick a safety pin in our cheek, drink
some more and, yes, eventually see the truth. The Sex Pistols showed
young Brits, and other youth the world over, how to party on truth's
wreckage. No matter, for the moment, if we were really only dancing
on our culture's exquisite corpse.</TE>

<HD>'Tuxedo' Is Smartly Tailored to Chan's Personality, Not
Action</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KENNETH TURAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>All Jackie Chan vehicles are of interest--how could they not be, with
him as the star?--but they're not all created equal, and it's fair to
say "The Tuxedo" will not be at the top of anyone's list. It's simply
Hollywood's latest attempt to fit Asia's iconoclastic action hero
into familiar genre patterns.</LD>
<LD>   Though Chan at age 48 may not have all the martial arts moves that
made his reputation in films like 1978's "Drunken Master," he hasn't
lost any of the irresistible warmth and pure likability that are his
trademark.</LD>
<LD>   Chan is so likable that matching him with an American co-star has
practically become a cottage industry. Jennifer Love Hewitt, his
partner here, follows Chris Tucker ("Rush Hour") and Owen Wilson
("Shanghai Noon") in a parade that might, for all we know, end with
Chan joining forces with Luke Skywalker, or maybe even Yoda. Despite
the nearly $1 billion in worldwide box office his estimated 80 to 100
films have earned, Chan is still able to project the boyishness and
insecurity of the new kid on the block. But even those aren't enough
to make "Tuxedo" a black-tie affair.</LD>
<TE>   Indifferently put together by Kevin Donovan, an award-winning
commercial director making his feature debut, "The Tuxedo" is in line
with the other recent Chan films that are heavier on personality than
action.</TE>
<TE>   Despite a presumably large budget and use of special effects, it
says something about this putative James Bond spoof that its most
memorable sequence is Chan doing a dead-on imitation of James Brown's
stage act. Even the outtakes that traditionally close Chan films deal
more with verbal than physical flubs.</TE>
<TE>   As the casting of Hewitt and a mild but unmistakable strain of
bathroom humor indicates, "Tuxedo" is aimed at an audience of
preteens who can be counted on to giggle when a deer urinates in a
stream before the film's opening credits are over.</TE>
<TE>   Patched together by four writers (screenplay by Michael J. Wilson
and Michael Leeson, story by Phil Hay &amp; Matt Manfredi and Michael J.
Wilson), "Tuxedo" can't do better than a plot that's way less
sophisticated than either "Spy Kids" movie.</TE>
<TE>   Still, the film's core gimmick, the high-concept idea that
probably got it made, is a serviceable one. It's the notion that a
top secret agent owns a tuxedo that gives the wearer the ability to
perform remarkable feats, a garment that can turn a shy innocent into
a martial arts machine.</TE>
<TE>   That innocent turns out to be cabdriver Jimmy Tong (Chan), too
timid to ask attractive women out for dates. His driving skills,
however, lead to a job as chauffeur for secret agent Clark Devlin
(Jason Isaacs, who was a memorable villain in "The Patriot").</TE>
<TE>   Devlin is on the track of bad guy Diedrich Banning (Ritchie
Coster), a megalomaniac who wants to use doctored water to take over
the world. Or something. At any rate, a job-related accident puts
Devlin out of commission, and Jimmy takes on both the tuxedo and the
challenge of stopping Banning.</TE>
<TE>   Mastering the tux is actually the harder task, and it can be
amusing to watch Chan make believe that the suit is making him do
things he wouldn't ordinarily attempt. It's as if the actor's regular
screen personality has been cut in two, with the suit getting the
fighting ability and Chan retaining the smile.</TE>
<TE>   As the newest secret agent's new partner, Del Blaine, Hewitt has a
hard time of it in a role that would be a challenge for anyone.</TE>
<TE>   Being Chan's straight man defines difficult assignment, and unlike
the characters Tucker and Wilson played, Blaine has been conceived as
strident and humorless, not the most felicitous combination for a
Jackie Chan film. Maybe Yoda isn't such a bad idea after all.</TE>
<TE>   MPAA rating: PG-13, for action violence, sexual content and
language. Times guidelines: Bathroom humor is a factor.</TE>

<HD>If Only 'Just a Kiss' Managed to Be Something More</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KENNETH TURAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"Just a Kiss" starts, fittingly enough, with a kiss and the words
that go with it. "This is going to be one of those terrible mistakes
you can't take back," says the man. Adds the woman, "Is there any
other kind?"</LD>
<LD>   As beginnings go, this is not bad, but the problem with "Just a
Kiss" is that it is all beginnings without the benefit of a real
ending. As written by co-star Patrick Breen and directed by actor
Fisher Stevens, it's a film that resorts to playing glib games with
structure to disguise the fact that it can't manage to put together a
manageable or fulfilling plot.</LD>
<LD>   Breen adapted the script from his own off-Broadway play about the
tangled dance of courtship between bright and attractive New Yorkers
for whom fidelity is not an option.</LD>
<TE>   As a stage and screen veteran, Breen knows how to write the kind
of slick, pleased-with-itself dialogue that performers can attack
with relish. And Stevens directs in a noticeably actor-friendly way.</TE>
<TE>   But though the cast ends up looking good, the film's unwillingness
or inability to have things add up hurts everyone's efforts.</TE>
<TE>   "Just a Kiss" puts its energy into introducing its people, setting
them up as they are now and as they were when they met their current
significant others. The gang of four who kiss initially involves
includes:</TE>
<TE>   * Dag (Ron Eldard), perhaps the only director of TV commercials
ever to be named after a former U.N. secretary-general, an
incorrigible womanizer who seems more helpless than conniving;</TE>
<TE>   * Halley (Kyra Sedgwick), a no-nonsense videographer who lives
with Dag and is trying to get him to shape up emotionally;</TE>
<TE>   * Peter (writer Breen), Dag's best friend, an insecure actor who
has made a name for himself playing the Peanut Butter Eagle in one of
Dag's commercials;</TE>
<TE>   * Rebecca (Marley Shelton), Peter's super-fragile girlfriend, a
gifted dancer with a savage choreographer (Zoe Caldwell) for a mother
and a weakness for suicide attempts.</TE>
<TE>   That opening-scene kiss--between, of all people, Dag and
Rebecca--is a kiss that leads to multiple complications and
eventually brings three other characters into the picture: an
articulate cellist (Taye Diggs), a stewardess (Sarita Choudhury) who
believes "moviegoing should be a life-or-death experience," and a
bowling alley bartender (Marisa Tomei, the film's liveliest
performer) who doubles as a dominatrix during her time off.</TE>
<TE>   If you're curious to know even a tiny bit about how these people
interact, you're out of luck, because "Just a Kiss" uses one of those
alternate-realities scenarios that makes it difficult to say whether
something actually took place or not.</TE>
<TE>   This kind of thing has been done before, most recently in "Sliding
Doors" with Gwyneth Paltrow and most profoundly in two films by the
great Polish director Krzysztof Kieslowski, "Blind Chance" and "The
Double Life of Veronique." Here, its use seems to be mainly as a
safety valve for filmmakers who aren't able to manage anything beyond
constructing amusing vignettes.</TE>
<TE>   Also without a discernible purpose is the film's sporadic use of
an animation technique called rotomation. This hip name
notwithstanding, rotomation is simply the computerized version of a
venerable process called rotoscoping, which works off live-action
images. Its appearance in "Just a Kiss," though nominally intended to
highlight emotion, comes off as no more than a gimmick.</TE>
<TE>   MPAA rating: R, for strong sexual images and language. Times
guidelines: somewhat graphic sexual encounters, including
sadomasochistic ones.</TE>

<HD>'Lonely Affair' Lacking Emotional Connections</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KEVIN THOMAS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"The Lonely Affair of the Heart" is a handsome, intelligent film of
rigorous austerity; unfortunately, for all its seriousness of purpose
and fine performances, it's also a boring film about boring people.</LD>
<LD>   It is hard to imagine an emptier existence than that of Rumi
Sakakibara's Orie, whose well-off husband Shiraki (Masakane Yonekura)
is 20 years her senior. He's provided his wife with a beautiful home
in the traditional Japanese style in a woodsy, upscale hillside
neighborhood.</LD>
<LD>   One day, Orie, who has no apparent interests, activities or
friends, is startled to discover a handsome young stranger (Kazuya
Takahashi) at the entrance to her house. He calls out, "I'm home,"
but quickly adds, "I made a mistake" and leaves. When he returns to
repeat himself, she persuades him to stay long enough for him to
explain that he has been distraught over his lover leaving him while
he was still mourning the death of his mother.</LD>
<TE>   These two brief encounters are enough to trigger in Orie a sexual
longing so strong that she begins imagining him returning again and
again only to realize gradually that rather than a lover she is
creating an alter ego with which to confront herself.</TE>
<TE>   Working from a story by Masaru Baba, Suzuki peels away layer after
layer in the lives of Orie and Shiraki, a tireless womanizer, but
there's nothing very intriguing to uncover. That, of course, is most
surely the point, but it takes a greater director than Suzuki to make
the story and fate of such people involving. For all its
psychological validity, the film is scarcely the revelation it means
to be.</TE>
<TE>   Not helping matters is that Suzuki takes such a stark approach to
his material, much of the time employing a stationary camera that
gives most scenes the feel of a filmed play. They lack the kind of
emotional impact that characterize the films of the great Yasujiro
Ozu, who could generate such tension with a similar approach.</TE>
<TE>   Unrated. Times guidelines: mature themes, some sex and nudity.</TE>

<LD>The flaccid new French action film "Wasabi" is the cinematic
equivalent of one of those tourist T-shirts your parents bring back
from vacation--you know, they get to go to Tokyo and you get this
stupid movie. Quite a few people were lucky enough to travel to Japan
for the making of this film, including its screenwriter and prolific
producer Luc Besson, who's best known here as the director of such
gleefully corrupt entertainments as "La Femme Nikita" and "The Fifth
Element." Besson isn't a talent who generally finds favor with
critics, but his movies are often too silly to cause serious offense.
They're glib and derivative, stuffed with big bangs and trend-toting
waifs, but at their most watchable they shimmy with the sort of
propulsive mayhem that can briefly obscure the most threadbare of
plots.</LD>
<TE>   A number of Besson's better follies have starred Jean Reno, whose
hangdog visage speaks eloquently to the French indignity at having to
share the world with other people. Reno is usually a pleasant
addition to any story, but even his knockabout bonhomie wears thin in
a vacuum. In "Wasabi," Reno stars as Hubert, a bruiser of a Parisian
cop famous for knocking suspects and innocents flat with his fists.
On the very day that he's forced on administrative leave, Hubert
learns that his long-lost girlfriend has died, a woman he hasn't seen
in about 20 years. Summoned to Japan, he discovers that his former
lover has left him in charge of a metal key, a fat bank account and
an annoying daughter, Yumi (Ryoko Hirosue), a screeching 19-year-old
whose grief at her mother's death is as fleeting and unpersuasive as
her charm.</TE>
<TE>   You don't have to be a math whiz to guess the rest--one hint is
Yumi's epic nose--which for all the glimpses of firepower primarily
consists of Tokyo tourist shots, some cheap innuendo about incest and
far too much of Hubert's mugging sidekick, Maurice (Michel Muller).
Directed by Gerard Krawczyk, who previously made Besson's "Taxi 2,"
"Wasabi" dawdles and drags when it should pop; it doesn't even have
the virtue of enough mindless violence to break up the tedium of all
its generational bonding. By the time some bad guys in suits and dark
glasses make the scene about 50 minutes into the story, Hubert and
Yumi are clothes shopping (yes, clothes shopping) to the thump of the
drum and bass beat. The only problem is that you don't want Hubert to
dispatch the yakuza too easily, because if he did all that would
remain of this rubbish is more French comedy and a Japanese monster
the size of a poodle.</TE>

<HD>Sure, It's a Boogie Fest, but Is It Worth the Price?</HD>
<DH>The crowd-pleasing 'Mamma Mia!' returns to L.A. The ABBA
songs are terrific, but the story and sets are a disappointment.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DARYL H. MILLER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The ABBA song celebration "Mamma Mia!" is known for its ability to
reveal the inner dancing queen in just about anyone. Presented in a
spirit of goofy good fun, it shoehorns 22 of the Swedish foursome's
infectious songs into a story that is dressed up in '70s-era
jumpsuits and platform boots and presented with full-out energy.</LD>
<LD>   In its return to Los Angeles at the Ahmanson Theatre, the show
transformed a recent audience into a sea of disco demons, with senior
citizens swaying and boogieing as enthusiastically as those who had
come dressed in bell-bottoms and dangling-sleeved blouses.</LD>
<LD>   It should be hard to dislike a show that can do that to an
audience--especially when the production is fronted by three-time
Tony Award nominee Dee Hoty and three audience favorites from the
show's presentation early last year at the Shubert.</LD>
<TE>   Yet, for all it accomplishes, "Mamma Mia!" remains a
disappointment to at least a few of us.</TE>
<TE>   As a teenager in the '70s, I wore down the vinyl on my copies of
the ABBA albums containing "Dancing Queen," "S.O.S." and "Mamma Mia."
But after buying a pair of tickets to last year's presentation of the
musical that includes those songs, I spent the entire performance
thinking, "I spent $140 for this?"</TE>
<TE>   The story--random events cobbled together to justify use of the
songs--was so stupid that it made my head hurt.</TE>
<TE>   And the set--which looks like a rusting ship but is meant to be a
Greek-isle taverna--appeared to have been built by a high school
drama club, an impression heightened by the fact that few in the cast
seemed to have reached drinking age.</TE>
<TE>   The songs, however, were terrific--sounding much as ABBA recorded
them, despite vocal adjustments necessary to match the tunes to
characters.</TE>
<TE>   For better or worse, the touring production at the Ahmanson equals
the pre-Broadway presentation at the Shubert.</TE>
<TE>   Hoty (best-known for her work in New York and Los Angeles in "The
Will Rogers Follies") is steely yet appealingly vulnerable as an
unmarried mom whose swinging past as a '70s pop singer comes back to
haunt her on the eve of her daughter's wedding. Hoty's dusky
mezzo-soprano drives the music, much as Louise Pitre's powerful pipes
propelled a star-making turn at the Shubert.</TE>
<TE>   In supporting roles, Mary Ellen Mahoney and Gabrielle Jones return
with their humorously over-the-top performances as the mom's former
backup singers, and Gary P. Lynch continues to display flinty sex
appeal as one of three possible fathers of the bride-to-be daughter
(now played by sweet but bland Michelle Aravena).</TE>
<TE>   If ABBA songwriters Benny Andersson and Bjorn Ulvaeus want to do
this right, though, here's a suggestion: The show's best feature is
its five-minute dance-along curtain call. Drop the dippy story and
turn this into a disco dance party at, say, $25 a head. Then it'll be
worth the price of admission.</TE>
<TE>   "Mamma Mia!," Ahmanson Theatre, 135 N. Grand Ave., L.A.
Tuesdays-Fridays, 8 p.m.; Saturdays, 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays, 2 and
7:30 p.m., with some variations. Ends Nov. 23. $25-$80. (213)
628-2772. Running time: 2 hours, 35 minutes.</TE>

<LD>   Barry White in Need</LD>
<LD>   of a Kidney Transplant</LD>
<TE>   Veteran R&amp;B singer Barry White has been hospitalized in Los
Angeles for kidney dialysis treatment.</TE>
<TE>   According to a brief statement released by his record company, the
deep-voiced, 58-year-old musician has a history of high blood
pressure that led to a decline in his kidney function. When his
condition stabilizes, doctors say he will be a candidate for an organ
transplant.</TE>

<TE>   Elvis' Hits Package Making Strong Debut</TE>
<TE>   The new Elvis Presley hits package, "Elvis: 30 #1 Hits," may reach
No. 1 on the album sales chart itself when first-week figures come in
on Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   The album, which was released Tuesday, is "shaping up like it
could be pretty huge," Wherehouse chain senior pop buyer Bob Bell
said Thursday, looking at the first two days of sales. "This is the
kind of title that's going to sell well in lots of different kinds of
retail and discount outlets as well as traditional record stores."</TE>
<TE>   Presley's record label is anticipating sales of at least 450,000
to 500,000 the first week, a range that would put it in the vicinity
of the Beatles' "1" collection of 27 of that group's hits. The "1"
album sold 595,000 during its first week in stores in 2000 and went
on to set the record for highest single-week sales other than first
week when it posted 1.26 million copies during the week leading up to
Christmas that year.</TE>
<TE>   "What is amazing is not only the scale and scope of the consumer
response, but the diversity in age and demographics," says Joe
DiMuro, senior vice president of strategic marketing for BMG
Entertainment. "It is clear that this campaign has been embraced
beyond the core Elvis Presley demographic."</TE>

<TE>   Damon Beats Bernie, NBC Takes 'Wing'</TE>
<TE>   It was good news, bad news, and more bad news for ABC on
Wednesday, as "My Wife and Kids" opened its season to strong ratings
while the second edition of "The Bachelor" and new drama "MDs" both
stumbled out of the starting gate versus a two-hour "The West Wing."</TE>
<TE>   ABC's Damon Wayans comedy averaged 14.8 million viewers with an
hourlong episode, easily beating Fox's tandem of "The Bernie Mac
Show" and "Cedric the Entertainer Presents," which together averaged
a little more than 8 million. Some observers had worried that the two
sitcoms with African American stars would cancel each other out, but
both fared reasonably well, particularly in the younger demographics
sought by advertisers.</TE>
<TE>   "The Bachelor," meanwhile, was left at the altar thanks largely to
the concluding installment of CBS' "Big Brother 3." The latter
unscripted program averaged nearly 13 million viewers, compared to 9
million for the ABC dating show.</TE>
<TE>   NBC's "West Wing" premiere towered over all, though its average
audience of 18.2 million viewers was down compared to last year's
opener, suggesting the three-time Emmy winner's popularity may have
peaked. The show's audience did build through the night, exceeding
combined tune-in for CBS' and ABC's medical shows, "Presidio Med" and
"MDs," at 10 p.m.</TE>

<TE>   KTLA's Rubin Suspended for Week</TE>
<TE>   KTLA "Morning News" entertainment reporter Sam Rubin has been
suspended from the station this week. KTLA executives declined to
comment on the action, saying, "This is a matter between KTLA and Sam
Rubin."</TE>
<TE>   But the suspension comes after Rubin delivered an on-air tirade
against KABC general manager Arnie Kleiner, calling him "a devil" and
suggesting he was on drugs. Rubin accused Kleiner of preventing him
from conducting an interview with Regis Philbin and Kelly Ripa, the
hosts of the syndicated "Regis &amp; Kelly," seen locally on KABC.</TE>
<TE>   Neither KABC officials nor Rubin could be reached for comment. He
is scheduled to return to the air Monday.</TE>

<TE>   Public Phone Calls a Hard Cell in New York</TE>
<TE>   When a cell phone goes off during a play or opera in New York in
the future, the offender could face more than a dirty look as the
City Council debates a ban on using cell phones at public
performances.</TE>
<TE>   A bill proposed by City Councilman Philip Reed of Manhattan would
prohibit the use of mobile phones in "places of public performance"
and make violators subject to a fine of up to $50. It would also
require the operators of the performance spaces to post signs
outlining the ban. The bill would not apply to outdoor venues.</TE>

<TE>   QUICK TAKES</TE>
<TE>   Saturday's L.A. concert by Persian singer Googoosh has been
postponed due to delays in visa processing. Tickets for the Staples
Center show will be honored at a future performance to be announced
shortly. Visa problems also have forced the cancellation of a Nov. 14
performance by the Afro-Cuban All-Stars at UCLA's Royce Hall.... The
Martin Beck Theater in New York will be renamed for artist Al
Hirschfeld, 99, according to the New York Times. Hirschfeld will
become the first artist to have a theater named after him and one of
the few people not directly involved in acting or producing ever so
honored.... The wife of Stone Temple Pilots frontman Scott Weiland
has filed for divorce after two years of marriage, citing
irreconcilable differences.</TE>

<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Colombian artist Oscar Munoz was an unforgettable standout in
"Amnesia," the 1998 show of new art from South America organized by
Christopher Grimes Gallery. His work there had sensual immediacy and
profound implications.</LD>
<LD>   In one group of images Munoz transferred photographic portraits
onto mirrored metal disks. The faces could hardly be seen until you
literally breathed life into them, the resulting fog briefly
intensifying the contrast between image and background surface. In
another piece, Munoz floated photographic images of body parts in
dark powder on the surface of shallow trays of water. Periodic drops
from faucets above gently eroded the images, while evaporation
gradually reduced them to a filmy residue.</LD>
<LD>   Mortality, contingency and transiency converged exquisitely. What
wasn't ephemeral was Munoz's own insight into time's power, and its
command over physical form and psychological comfort.</LD>
<TE>   His first solo show in L.A., now at Iturralde Gallery, more than
affirms his technical and philosophical gifts. The show, called
"Trans figuraciones," contains photographs, videos and sculptural
installations. Metamorphosis of spiritual and mythical import is
invoked here, though the work also speaks powerfully on a basic,
physical level, echoing the body's passage from wholeness to decay.</TE>
<TE>   In one series Munoz used a silk-screen-like process (as in the
"Amnesia" work) to transfer a photographic self-portrait in coal dust
onto the surface of water in a shallow clear plastic box. In time the
water evaporated, and what Munoz exhibits here is the thin, gray
crust that remained in the box, forming a ghostly, diffused image of
the artist's face.</TE>
<TE>   Through this stunning process Munoz triggers multiple, overlapping
associations. The photograph's relationship to the body photographed
feels palpable. And if the photograph is a physical trace of the
body, is this dry dust the trace of a trace? The grainy images in
these trays bring to mind the famous Shroud of Turin, said to bear
the imprint of Christ's body. The debate over authenticity only
serves to remind us how much belief--or at least the suspension of
disbelief--strengthens the claims of presence and likeness.</TE>
<TE>   In photographic sequences and two videos, Munoz tracks another
type of transformation, as powdered portraits and self-portraits
floating in a sink full of water are sucked down the drain. As the
water level lowers, suction corrupts each face's features into a
discontinuous mess, a Rorschach blot of indeterminate meaning. The
coherence of the form succumbs to randomness. Personality devolves
into base matter. The real and immediate shrink into memory.</TE>
<TE>   Such is our common fate as animate beings. Vanity vexes the
process, though, and, like Narcissus, for whom Munoz titles many of
these works, we cling tragically to what affirms our own beauty,
resisting the tug of the drain.</TE>

<TE>   Potter's Assemblages:</TE>
<TE>   A Film of Meaning</TE>
<TE>   Carter Potter's new work at Angles sets in motion a scramble for
definition. Are these paintings? Are they sculpture? Are they
gimmicks or something more?</TE>
<TE>   Potter attaches strips of 70-millimeter film to a frame the way a
painter might stretch a canvas, creating a continuous, image-bearing
surface. The film he uses is castoff leader, either clear, opaque
brown or tinged with painterly spills of cyan, magenta and gold.
Though earlier works by Potter (and one anomalous piece here) use
film from the prime of a reel, imprinted with figures and scenes, the
rest of the lengths used here are purely utilitarian, marked only
with technical notations and countdown numbers.</TE>
<TE>   Like many assemblage artists who recycle found materials, Potter
stages a reincarnation of sorts, investing detritus with a new
purpose and even a modest degree of beauty.</TE>
<TE>   The clear passages of film allow us to see straight through to the
stretcher bars and the wall, while the more opaque lengths reflect
back our own image stuttering vertically down the banded surface.</TE>
<TE>   Some of the works have the rough dimensions of a door; others are
substantially larger. All are composed of paired panels that seem to
bend at the waist, the lower section resting on the floor, leaning
into the wall, and the upper portion flat against the wall. The
leaning calls to mind the plank sculptures of John McCracken, but the
form also conjures up the more pedestrian shape of a collapsible
patio lounge chair, slats and all.</TE>
<TE>   Potter seems to have something more serious in mind, courting
references to stripe paintings and Finish Fetish slickness. But these
"Test Results," as he calls them, are mixed. They can seem facile
but, then again, crisply patterned and luminous. Ultimately they
settle into that vast middle ground between the banal and the
transcendent.</TE>

<TE>   An Accumulation of the Everyday in Fors' Works</TE>
<TE>   Jose Fors is a poet of the physical world, a collector of bits and
pieces, scraps and memories. Even when his work is not at its most
potent, as in his current show at Couturier Gallery, it still exerts
a soulful pull.</TE>
<TE>   "Fallen Leaves" is the title of the show and one of its
installations, but it is also an apt metaphor for the photographs
Fors uses--tokens of life turned into brittle, brown memories. In the
most understated and affecting of the works here, "Las Ventanas" (The
Windows), Fors mounts more than 300 photographs, small as postage
stamps, in neat rows along one long wall of the gallery.</TE>
<TE>   Toned in nostalgic browns and with marks of abrasion that push
them deep into the past, the pictures coalesce into a diary of
memories: family scenes, posed portraits, but also fragments of
leaves and trees, a ball of yarn, the slats of a fence, a feather, an
eye. Each is, indeed, a tiny window, framing a view of both the
external world and internal experience.</TE>
<TE>   In the central installation, "Hojarascas" (Fallen Leaves), Fors
places 18 vitrines in three rows on the floor, each plastic box
filled with dried leaves and, typically, a tied bundle of yellowed
papers and pictures, topped by an object--a doll's head, a cracked
plate, an old metal keepsake box. The combinations seem unusually
forced for Fors, but the work has an elegiac edge. Passing through
the rows feels much like wandering among tombs.</TE>
<TE>   In his last show here, Fors presented a spectacular, giant
wall-mounted blossom built petal by petal from his toned and
manipulated photographs (their size a solution, initially, to the
shortage of photographic materials in his native Cuba).</TE>
<TE>   Here he retains the same format, with all of its radiant
ebullience, but replaces the photographs of small, ordinary things
with the things themselves. "El Circulo: Los Objetos" (The Circle:
The Objects) is a diary too, a record of the humble things one
touches over time--the buttons, coins, toys, shells, jar lids, paper
clips, keys and bottle tops.</TE>
<TE>   There's something tender about Fors' devotion to such mundane
matter, his elevation of the inconsequential. But most of the objects
verge on the generic, so the assemblage as a whole carries less of
the deliciously bittersweet emotional weight of its counterpart in
photographs.</TE>

<TE>   Collier's Photographs</TE>
<TE>   Detach From Reality</TE>
<TE>   The visual richness of life is unavoidable, but passionate
expression about it isn't. Conscious detachment has blossomed--or,
more accurately, metastasized--into a mainstream preoccupation.</TE>
<TE>   In contemporary art, emotional minimalism is hot by virtue of its
extreme coolness.</TE>
<TE>   In her new color photographs at Marc Foxx Gallery, Anne Collier
practices a deadpan realism that traces its roots back to Walker
Evans and William Eggleston. The style has far too many contemporary
cousins diluting the line, straddling the juicy and the dry, printing
large, vivid color scenes of nondescript banality.</TE>
<TE>   At its best, this focus on the unheralded vernacular and domestic
coheres into cultural commentary--acute, savvy, ironic. But much of
the time, such work feels merely, though intentionally, flat.</TE>
<TE>   Collier's images are distanced, but not always vacant of feeling
or meaning. She addresses the suppression of emotion more than she
simply practices it. In "Mother and Son" and "Daughter," for
instance, she photographs two other photographs, lovely, sentimental
portraits typical of commercial studios.</TE>
<TE>   They sit among others on display in the portrait photographer's
shop window, icons of familial bliss. Collier backs away from them
enough to suggest, somewhat wistfully, that the sentiments
represented within are several steps removed from her not just
physically but also emotionally.</TE>
<TE>   In another image, Collier herself sits in the empty stands of
Dodger Stadium, an emblem of alienation within an implied crowd. The
vibrancy of the grassy field and the bands of colored seats dwarfs
her tiny figure, but not with any great metaphorical force. Two other
pictures, of people waiting in lines for a concert and an exhibition
opening, lack any visual spark and invite only superficial
comparisons between the demographics of the groups involved.</TE>
<TE>   Collier, a recent UCLA graduate now living in Berkeley, allies
herself most provocatively with photography's relentless clarity in
an image of a set of self-help cassette tapes. Eight tapes sit neatly
in their white plastic case, each one labeled with an emotion
addressed within: fear, anger, despair, guilt, hope, joy and love.
Here again, is the juicy stuff of life, but in dry, dispassionate
form. Collier's uninflected gaze allows these products of isolation
and yearning to speak for themselves--and perhaps for her.</TE>

<HD>Newman to Play Broadway; Last Appearance: 1964</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Paul Newman will return to the Great White Way in December to appear
in Thornton Wilder's "Our Town," his first foray onto a Broadway
stage since the 1964 comedy "Baby Wants a Kiss."</LD>
<LD>   Earlier this year, Newman played the role of the stage manager
during a run at Connecticut's Westport Country Playhouse, where his
wife, actress Joanne Woodward, is artistic director.</LD>
<LD>   "I'd given up hope that he'd ever go back to the stage," says
director James Naughton.</LD>
<TE>   But Woodward was able to persuade her husband to appear in the
Westport production, which will move with its entire cast to
Broadway's Booth Theatre in December.</TE>
<TE>   Woodward and Newman were traveling on Thursday and unavailable for
comment.</TE>
<TE>   Newman called Naughton recently to say that a film shoot he was
planning with Robert Altman had fallen through, and that he was
interested in accompanying "Our Town" to New York. The play will run
from Dec. 4 through Jan. 26 with the original Westport cast members,
including Jane Curtin, Frank Converse and Stephen Spinella.</TE>

<HD>Diverting Proficiency, but Little More</HD>
<DH>San Francisco Ballet displays its prowess in a varied
program that revealed nothing new.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LEWIS SEGAL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Founded in 1933, San Francisco Ballet is America's first professional
classical company, and over the decades it has danced its way to
major international recognition.</LD>
<LD>   Its mixed bill at the Orange County Performing Arts Center on
Wednesday (the opening of an engagement that switches tonight to a
full-evening "Othello") proved that the company can look
authoritative in 19th century showpieces, home-grown dance dramas and
acquisitions from the world of modern dance.</LD>
<LD>   But this evening of local premieres had nothing genuinely new to
offer, no vision of ballet as anything other than expensive,
conservative entertainment. You could marvel at all the honed
proficiency on view, but after that, nothing.</LD>
<TE>   Indeed, the evening proved most memorable for rehabilitating the
reputation of Mark Morris at a time when his choreography for his own
modern dance ensemble has become progressively hollow and
formula-ridden.</TE>
<TE>   Choreographed for the San Franciscans three years ago, Morris'
plotless "Sandpaper Ballet" created a sense of spontaneous, childlike
buoyancy through the charming white-and-green play clothes designed
by Isaac Mizrahi, the zesty orchestral bagatelles composed by Leroy
Anderson and the choreography for a 25-member super-corps.</TE>
<TE>   There were typical Morris structural ploys (lines forming and
re-forming), but, for once, they never became predictable. There were
typical Morris jokes (people "accidentally" out of line), but, for
once, they never looked forced. So when the music repeated itself but
the dancing didn't, or a slew of guys suddenly tried to partner the
hyper-glamorous Muriel Maffre, Morris took you by surprise.</TE>
<TE>   Although James Sofranko and Nicole Starbuck danced a sweet early
duet, the ballet increasingly focused on Yuri Possokhov, a
distinguished classical cavalier and dancing actor here enjoying such
anti-classical challenges as a gymnastic floor tussle with Julie
Diana.Possokhov also choreographed the serious ballet that always
comes in the middle of this kind of mixed bill: "Damned," based on
the Greek tragedy "Medea" and set to two pieces by Ravel, including
the highly challenging Concerto in D major for the left hand.</TE>
<TE>   Unfortunately, the narrative portions of the work weren't merely
bad, they were corrupt--throwing nonstop showpiece steps and lifts at
a classic of world drama as if that somehow made the storytelling
clear or powerful.</TE>
<TE>   The equally fine Guennadi Nedviguine, as Jason, and Starbuck as
his doomed new mistress, thus turned romance into something
resembling the international ballet Olympics, and even Lorena
Feijoo's magnificent intensity as Medea soon became misused.</TE>
<TE>   However, Possokhov manipulated a masked, 16-member corps with
unfailing mastery. Designer Thyra Hartshorn left these dancers
looking vaguely sphinx-like, and they never really meshed with the
dramatic action. Still, they alone caught the surge and sweep of the
concerto, and they alone confirmed Possokhov's talent.</TE>
<TE>   The evening's inevitable dose of tutus and tights came in the
company premiere of a 34-minute suite from Marius Petipa's 1881
version of "Paquita," in a staging created 99 years later by the
great Russian ballerina Natalia Makarova.</TE>
<TE>   As the San Francisco dancers grow into the work, corps lines will
no doubt become straighter and the height of extensions adjusted for
greater evenness. But at this first performance, you could already
find artists such as Feijoo, Clara Blanco and Vanessa Zahorian
turning their solos into something individual, and the cast as a
whole understanding how much refined arm movement contributes to the
style of the ballet.</TE>
<TE>   Like many of her colleagues, Yuan Yuan Tan seemed at times to be
working through the choreography. But in her best moments she danced
the prima ballerina role with feeling as well as exactitude, finding
an impetus in the Minkus score that carried her through step
combinations on one sustained breath.</TE>
<TE>   Vadim Solomakha partnered her effortfully, but delivered bold,
clean turning combinations in his solo. Other principals included
Katita Waldo, Gonzalo Garcia, Sarah Van Patten and Kristin Long.
Guest conductor Neal Stulberg expertly led the Pacific Symphony
through the evening's radically different scores, and pianist Roy
Bogas skillfully performed the solos in the Ravel concerto. Once
again, the evening displayed San Francisco Ballet's impressive
prowess, but also arguably squandered an extraordinary amount of
talent and training on familiar kinds of upscale diversions, as if
the company or even ballet itself had no real future, only an
endlessly recycled past.</TE>

8 p.m.; Sunday, 2 p.m. Orange County Performing Arts Center, 600 Town

<LD>W omen's liberation might not be the first thought that comes to mind
when considering the independent film "Secretary," which opened last
Friday. In it, the audience sees an emotionally disturbed young woman
(Lee Holloway, played by Maggie Gyllenhaal), in the office, trying
her best to deliver coffee and mail to her boss (Mr. Grey, played by
James Spader) though her arms are locked in a yoke across her
shoulders. He, in turn, likes to spank and otherwise humiliate her
whenever she makes a mistake. The tone is light, and the filmmakers
say the movie is meant to be taken at least partly as metaphor. Even
so, many psychologists would still recommend therapy for such a
couple, and some pre-postmodern feminists are simply appalled.
"There's nothing beautiful or wonderful about needing to be beaten to
feel alive or, worse, wanted," writes Web film critic MaryAnn
Johanson (www.flickfilosopher.com). There are, however, those who see
a new sexual pragmatism afoot, one in which the personal has ceased
to be political. It's just personal. Here, four women--the
screenwriter, the star, her mother and a feminist film critic--talk
about "Secretary" and what it says about current attitudes about sex.</LD>
<LD>   *</LD>
<LD>   Erin Cressida Wilson, 38</LD>
<TE>   A professor at Duke University, she has had a 15-year career
writing plays, many of which deal with sexually complex women. She
and director Steven Shainberg based the script for "Secretary" on a
short story by Mary Gaitskill, from her collection "Bad Behavior":</TE>
<TE>   "I've had such a hard time explaining the movie. I've had to learn
how to talk about it. At first it was impossible. It can't be
compared to anything. It's not an S&amp;M film. I know that when she's
spanked, there's often a laugh in the audience. It's very funny. It's
also very sexy to me. A big part of the way I write is to combine
humor with sex. It's not salacious. It can be fun.</TE>
<TE>   " 'Secretary' doesn't politicize the sexuality or the
relationship. It doesn't insist on taking sides. Also, it doesn't
seek to solve problems. The secretary does not seek to get over her
masochism as if it were a deviant problem. She actually embraces it.
It also turns cliches on their heads. Instead of her running to
arrest him and screaming equal rights, she falls in love with him.
And he in turn gets afraid. She owns her submissive quality.</TE>
<TE>   "In the '80s, it seemed there was a lot of anti-male sentiment. To
be a real feminist, it was less OK to be rampantly heterosexual. That
was my experience. So now my reaction was to insist you could be a
feminist and you could be a three-dimensional woman and still love
men. I was brought up as a feminist. Maybe the movie represents a
wave of feminism that hasn't been named.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a weirdly sweet movie. I think it's a date movie. I get a
lot of young women saying, 'I don't even have any interest in S&amp;M,
but this movie spoke to me and I cried. I saw myself.' You're either
going to love it or not. If you don't love it, I think you secretly
do love it and are afraid to say you love it."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Maggie Gyllenhaal, 24</TE>
<TE>   She co-starred with her brother Jake in "Donnie Darko" (2001),
appears in the upcoming Spike Jonze film "Adaptation" and will star
in John Sayles' "Casa de los Babys":</TE>
<TE>   "I saw in the script the possibility of it saying something new,
interesting and open about the way men and women relate to each
other. Also, in the wrong hands, it could be anti-feminist and a
reactionary movie. I was both worried about that and very interested
in the other thing it could be. I feel like if something is so risky
and so new that it's scary, it's also very appealing to me.</TE>
<TE>   "Over the last century, let's say, a lot of rules have been set up
by the culture and the feminist movement about the ways men and women
are allowed to relate to each other. For a long time they were really
helpful, and I don't take them for granted at all. But I feel I'm
just now beginning to be a woman, and I look at the rules that I
actually feel around me, and I feel restricted by them in some ways.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm in a very privileged position. I'm educated, I live in New
York, my mother [Naomi Foner] is a writer-producer. My grandmother
was a doctor. I know not everybody has a life like that. Because I
do, I feel it's my responsibility to nudge those rules a bit and see
what needs to be rethought a little bit, or just questioned.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it's a shame to be told what you are supposed to desire
and not desire. When I was 23, I thought love was supposed to be pure
and clean and pleasant in a way. Now I don't know if I think that. It
has to be a whole lot of things. In order to really truly love
someone, you also have to acknowledge the dark, complicated, painful
things that exist in everybody."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Naomi Foner, 56</TE>
<TE>   Maggie Gyllenhaal's mother is the Oscar-nominated screenwriter of
"Running on Empty" (1998), which starred the late River Phoenix. She
is married to director Steven Gyllenhaal:</TE>
<TE>   "At first I was terribly concerned. I'm Maggie's mother. I love
her dearly. I was concerned about her putting herself in physical
danger, exposing herself in a sexual way. I was comforted by the fact
that the film was based on a short story by Mary Gaitskill, who is
clearly a neo-feminist. People who knew that the screenplay was
written by a woman and that there was a woman producer [Amy Hobby]
would know that nobody set out to do some prurient, sadomasochistic
movie. But things are easily misunderstood.</TE>
<TE>   "It has to be read as an allegory. You don't really get close to
anybody unless you face your own pain and deal with it. There's a
whole other level to this: A lot of relationship stuff is about
power. Someone is dominant, someone is submissive, in an allegorical
way. You are misused only if you haven't chosen something. Clearly
Lee Holloway has chosen a certain kind of sexuality. At the end,
she's completely empowered.</TE>
<TE>   "It is remarkable to me that this generation of young people we
have raised is much more open about many things than we were in the
'60s and '70s. None of the kids I know bat an eyelash about
homosexual relationships, unconventional families or groupings of
people. They understand that does not define love or family or
sexuality. We went partway up the mountain. They've gone the rest of
the way."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Molly Haskell, 63</TE>
<TE>   She is a writer, film critic and influential feminist. Her next
column for the New York Observer will be about the movie "Secretary":</TE>
<TE>   "We're in a phase where we no longer condemn movies for having a
negative image. We're at a point where we can explore the darker side
of women's nature, and men's as well. 'Secretary' does it with humor.
There's something exhilaratingly kinky about it and liberating. She's
never going to be cured. She still has some kind of need for
self-abuse. But she has it in a place where she can do it playfully.</TE>
<TE>   "They create the game as they go along. Very often the so-called
masochist is the so-called manipulated person. They take turns being
manipulated. So there's a kind of equality. It's not so much feminism
as it is that feminism allows us to go beyond what we heretofore
thought of as good and bad images of women. We've gotten past that
phase."</TE>

<LD>"Dessalines (The Heart) Blood and Liberation: For the Love of
Freedom, Part II," at the Greenway Court Theatre, is the second
offering in Levy Lee Simon's sweeping historical trilogy about the
Haitian fight for independence. Like the first play in the trilogy,
"For the Love of Freedom, Part I: Toussaint," Simon's massively
ambitious enterprise alternates between the authoritative and the
excessive.</LD>
<LD>   As the play opens in 1802, Toussaint L'Ouverture, the visionary
leader of the Haitian revolution that freed the islands' blacks from
slavery--and the subject of part one of Levy's trilogy--is
languishing in a dungeon in the French Alps. Insurgents are still at
large in the countryside, but relative peace and prosperity reigns on
the island.</LD>
<LD>   Jean Jacques Dessalines (vigorous, grandly heroic Abner Genece),
now a top-ranking officer in the French army under Napoleon, is
enjoying the riches and prestige of his position when he learns of a
French plot to reintroduce slavery on the island. Born a slave, the
outraged Dessalines, popularly known as "The Tiger" for his ferocity
in battle, breaks with the French forever, takes command of the
indigenous rebel forces and leads his country to independence.</LD>
<TE>   But there's a dark side to this popular hero. After ascending to
power, Dessalines engages in the kind of bloody and genocidal deeds
that rival the French at their most sanguinary. Simon doesn't flinch
from dealing with Dessalines' later atrocities. However, Dessalines'
progression from hero to tyrant is curiously abrupt and
insufficiently explicated here. Also, outrageous overstatement
sometimes derails Simon's otherwise smooth-running narrative, as in
the case in which a French lady beheads a slave girl for a minor
infraction and serves up her head at a genteel banquet. Even if such
an outrage actually occurred, it's a grisly aberration that
undermines the piece's historical veracity.</TE>
<TE>   Director Ben Guillory again helms the mind-bogglingly complex
proceedings, which are enlivened throughout by musical director Leon
Mobley's wonderful live percussion music. The briskly staged dance
and battle sequences by choreographer Ayana Cahrr and fight
choreographer Yvans Jourdain deserve high praise, as does Guillory,
who, as before, presides over his enormous and passionate cast with
appropriately military efficiency, mitigating Simon's occasional
lapses with sheer zeal.</TE>

<TE>   Ozzy Might Like Odd, Now-Dated 'No Scratch'</TE>
<TE>   Somewhere within the 21st anniversary revival of "No Scratch" at
the Fremont Centre Theatre, one character exclaims: "We've been
trying to figure it out all afternoon." They aren't alone.</TE>
<TE>   The reference is directed at the show that several characters have
paid a bundle to see, but it is equally pertinent to the bigger
picture they and everyone else, including the audience out front, are
trapped in.</TE>
<TE>   Writer-director Frederick Bailey's 1981 construct about a criminal
gang that presents living-room vaudeville as a front for nefarious
operations is billed as a "radical farce." Well, that's one way of
putting it, although "rhetorical fuss" also applies, or "Rottweiler
fierce," or just plain goofy.</TE>
<TE>   During the Reagan era of its premiere, with notables like Beth
Henley in the ranks, and actor Stephen Tobolowsky supplying tunes
like "That Cat in the Backyard With a Fat Tail," this may well have
seemed anarchistic. Well, that was then.</TE>
<TE>   The designs are striking, with Victoria Profitt's seedy set
delineating the sort of slum one can imagine existing in the
"Ferocious Depression of the 2020s." The amphetamine-powered ensemble
is tireless, with Will Utay's ringleader suggesting the late James
Gleason reinvented by Quentin Tarantino.</TE>
<TE>   However, high energy can take a show only so far; it can't supply
satirical point.</TE>
<TE>   Although undeniably different, "No Scratch" seems most
recommendable to the Osbourne brood, fraternity boys and fans of the
self-consciously weird.</TE>
<TE>   "No Scratch," Fremont Centre Theatre, 1000 Fremont Ave., South
Pasadena. Fridays-Saturdays, 8 p.m.; Sundays, 3 p.m. Ends Oct. 27.
$16-$18. (626) 441-5977. Mature audiences. Running time: 2 hours.</TE>

<TE>   Musical 'Paradise Lost'</TE>
<TE>   Is a Scattershot Spoof</TE>
<TE>   You know it's spoof territory when a timid Satan is teased by the
other devils as "Loser-fer" and the serpent's brassiness rivals Bette
Midler on a third curtain call. They're just two of the players in
"Paradise Lost: The Musical," a new show by Michael Merriam, a
first-time writer-director in his 20s, and the fledgling Lancer
Entertainment Inc. production company, founded by 22-year-old James
George.</TE>
<TE>   In a celestial-size understatement, Merriam describes his creation
as "loosely based" on Milton's epic poem about Satan's expulsion from
heaven and Adam and Eve's tricky days in Eden and beyond. Setting up
in the comfy Forum Theater at the Festival of the Arts in Laguna
Beach, "Paradise Lost: The Musical" isn't much of a musical. The 10
songs--ditties really, many without resonance--are tossed about,
almost as afterthoughts.</TE>
<TE>   Merriam and his cast tweak those Old Testament fogies and their
sermonizing ways. Some passages are imaginative and, better yet,
actually funny. Satan (Marcus Woodswelch) puffs himself up throughout
(you can almost hear him chanting a daily affirmation in his horned
head: "I am truly evil, and, yes, people are really scared of me!"),
and Adam and Eve (Shane Barach and Candace Johnson) enjoy a tilted
rapport. Johnson, who shines, is given the sole memorable number,
"Reflection," which she renders sweetly as a ballad of love turned
sour.</TE>
<TE>   Overall, however, "Paradise Lost: The Musical" has a scattershot
feel. Tighten here, retool there, and Merriam could have something.
Maybe not paradise found, but something more than an extended series
of skits.</TE>
<TE>   "Paradise Lost: The Musical," produced by Lancer Entertainment
Inc., Forum Theater, Festival of the Arts, 650 Laguna Canyon Road,
Laguna Beach. Fridays, 8 p.m.; Saturdays, 7:30 p.m. Ends Oct. 5.
$20-$25. (949) 487-9260. Running time: 2 hours, 5 minutes.</TE>

<HD>For Love or Money in 'Elysian Fields'</HD>
<DH>In George Hickenlooper's elegant film, a wonderful cast
explores variations of romance--sophisticated, naive and otherwise.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KEVIN THOMAS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>George Hickenlooper's "The Man From Elysian Fields" is a shimmering
fable of innocence and experience set in contemporary Los Angeles and
Pasadena (its title is a nod to Virgil's "Aeneid"). Phillip Jayson
Lasker's tartly knowing script, with the kind of witty dialogue
that's all but vanished from American movies, recalls Hickenlooper's
"The Low Life" in its depiction of the struggle to make it in L.A.,
and, as a romantic odyssey, Hickenlooper and film critic F.X.
Feeney's Orson Welles adaptation, "The Big Brass Ring."</LD>
<LD>   "The Man From Elysian Fields," however, represents a substantial
advance for Hickenlooper in assurance and clarity. With its poetic,
moody camera work by Kramer Morgenthau, a frequent Hickenlooper
collaborator, this is an elegant film with often surprising twists
and an intermingling of naivete and sophistication. It is bolstered
by a dream cast: Andy Garcia, Mick Jagger, Julianna Margulies, Olivia
Williams, James Coburn and Anjelica Huston.</LD>
<LD>   Garcia's Byron Tiller is a former advertising man who threw over
his career to devote seven years to writing "Hitler's Child," in
which he imagines that Hitler and Eva Braun had a son who was then
raised in Argentina. Improbable as it seems, the novel received some
good reviews, but soon vanished off the shelves.</LD>
<TE>   Tiller, his wife Dena (Margulies) and their small son live in a
messy, run-down cottage with a dirt frontyard in one of Pasadena's
seedier sections. Dena has been a rich man's rebellious daughter who
remains passionately in love with her husband and takes a romantic
view of poverty.</TE>
<TE>   When Byron's latest manuscript--in which King Arthur's sword
Excalibur is symbolic of hope for a group of migrant workers--fails
to excite his agent, he understands how tough it's going to be to
support a family. But he's had a chance encounter with Luther Fox
(Jagger), a well-tailored, well-spoken Brit with an office on the
same floor as Byron's agent in a fine old Hollywood Boulevard
building.</TE>
<TE>   Suave and insinuating, Luther has actually read "Hitler's Child,"
admiring the writing but dismissing its farfetched premise. He offers
Byron a job at his firm, Elysian Fields, which turns out to be a tony
escort service. Byron, chagrined but desperate, reluctantly agrees
and envisions he'll be dispatched to one of the wealthy grande dames
who make up Luther's clientele. Andrea Alcott (Williams) turns out to
be rich, young and beautiful; she's also the wife of a Pulitzer
Prize-winning Hemingway-esque novelist Tobias Alcott (Coburn), who
happens to be Byron's literary idol.</TE>
<TE>   That the poised Andrea and the gruff, colorful Tobias are the
epitome of worldliness and sophistication alleviates Byron's
self-loathing. Meanwhile, Luther has grown weary of the escort
business; he now personally takes care of only one client, the
married, wealthy Jennifer (Huston), Elysian Fields' chief backer.</TE>
<TE>   These developments are a prelude to bringing Byron and Luther to
unexpected moments of truth for which neither is prepared. The way
their fates play out reveals mature, wise perspective on life and
human nature--and a surprisingly puritanical streak in regard to
prostitution. The effect of this view, intended or otherwise,
fortunately is dryly amusing rather than detrimental to the film.</TE>
<TE>   The six key roles and some principal supporting parts are
well-written and well-directed. Garcia's Byron is a likable guy who
gets in over his head, and Garcia expresses all the ups and downs on
his path toward wisdom. Jagger's Luther, Coburn's Tobias and Michael
Des Barres, as one of Elysian Fields' veteran escorts, get the
majority of shrewdly amusing lines.</TE>
<TE>   Of Dena, whom he has never met, Tobias sagely warns Byron that a
woman who accepts a man the way he is a woman who settles for less.
Williams' Andrea is one cool customer, while Margulies' Dena is more
innocent than even her husband. Jagger, whose screen appearances have
been few but memorable, and Huston share one of the film's major
moments--one that could easily have backfired--but they pull it off.
Notable among a large supporting cast are Rosalind Chao and veterans
Joe Santos and Richard Bradford.</TE>
<TE>   "The Man From Elysian Fields" captures the ever-shifting fortunes
that characterize life for so many in L.A. Silent star Antonio
Moreno's Spanish-style mansion, though in Los Angeles, serves as the
luxurious, isolated Pasadena estate.</TE>
<TE>   MPAA rating: R, for language and sexual content. Times guidelines:
mature themes, but little actual sex.</TE>

<HD>Composer Speaks Out on His Cagey Use of Silence</HD>
<DH>Music* Defending his group's homage to a classic work, Mike
Batt says he didn't settle, but made a sporting gesture.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SCOTT TIMBERG</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>What started out as a moment of silence has become drawn out and
noisy. Classical crossover artist Mike Batt hasn't run out of things
to say about the one minute of dead air he recorded as a cheeky
homage to composer John Cage--a CD track that landed Batt in legal
trouble.</LD>
<LD>   The silent moment, on the debut album of Batt's rock/classical
group the Planets, nods in the direction of a landmark 1952 Cage
composition called "4'33"," in which the composer asks the musicians
to play nothing for four minutes and 33 seconds. Batt called his
version "A One Minute Silence" and credited it to Batt/Cage. When
Cage's publishers in New York and London, Peters Edition, complained
and threatened to sue, a British copyright agency withheld some of
Batt's royalties. Batt said he laughed at first--but when the
copyright agency reversed itself and determined there had been no
infringement, he also thought he could laugh last. He staged a
musical duel of his silence and Cage's in London and, just this week,
released a single of "One Minute Silence."</LD>
<TE>   "They didn't have a leg to stand on," Batt says from London. "So I
rang them up and said, 'Look, I want all the royalties back, but as a
gesture of sportsmanship, I will make a donation to the John Cage
Trust.' Because even though I've made fun of him, even though I find
avant-garde Minimalism tiresome, I do respect John Cage's particular
brand of humor. I would make a gesture, in the manner of a victor's
handshake, not in the manner of a beaten plagiarist. And we did agree
that we would not disclose the sum."</TE>
<TE>   Neither the trust, which administers Cage's estate, nor Batt will
reveal the size of that gesture. Six figures has been reported, but,
Batt hints, that is far too high. Reports also said that Batt had
been sued and settled out of court, neither of which is true.</TE>
<TE>   "I said publicly I'd cheerily go to jail if the British court
ruled that I was a plagiarist for recording a minute's worth of
silence," says Batt, underlining that he made the donation of his own
free will. "My mother said, 'Which minute of the four minutes 33 do
they allege that you stole?' "</TE>
<TE>   Says Nicholas Riddle, managing director of Peters Edition, "Cage
would find it fascinating that 50 years after the piece was first
composed we're still talking about it."</TE>

<HD>New '48 Hours' Probes Bizarre Case</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOSH FRIEDMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Ronald Malave had no idea what he was in for eight years ago when a
new patient named Jane walked into his Orlando, Fla., psychiatry
office. Jane's eight personalities include Delilah, the budding
journalist, and Vanessa, the foulmouthed street punk, but it was her
seductive 16-year-old persona called Bridgette that got Malave into a
world of trouble.</LD>
<LD>   The bizarre case is examined in tonight's premiere of "48 Hours
Investigates" (8 p.m., CBS), a revamped version of "48 Hours" with
Lesley Stahl replacing Dan Rather as anchor. Stahl will stay with "60
Minutes" as well.</LD>
<LD>   Jane appears to switch personalities rapidly during interviews
with correspondent Peter Van Sant and in courtroom highlights, but
the tone of this series seems consistent with the old version as well
as with that of several other TV newsmagazines: highbrow tabloid.</LD>
<TE>   As it has since the 1988 debut of "48 Hours," the show will focus
on a single topic in each episode.</TE>
<TE>   But as the name implies, it will feature more investigative work,
according to CBS.</TE>
<TE>   "You won't see another spring break show like we had this year," a
network spokeswoman said.</TE>
<TE>   In tonight's episode, "A Crime of the Mind," the producers hire
independent DNA experts to re-analyze forensic evidence from the
trial of Malave, who was acquitted of having sex with his patient.
Malave said that Jane had a "fatal attraction" and that her various
personas worked "in cahoots" to frame him.</TE>
<TE>   By focusing on microscopic detail, the show indirectly raises
questions about the use of DNA evidence in general. The evidence may
be flawless, but the humans interpreting it are not.</TE>
<TE>   Like some of the other magazine shows, "48 Hours Investigates"
keeps you guessing, but tonight's episode, at least, goes one better:
It gets you thinking.</TE>

<HD>'Moonlight' Grieves and Loves, Hollywood-Style</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KENNETH TURAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Calculation and sincerity struggle for the soul of "Moonlight Mile,"
always an unequal combat when Hollywood is the battleground. What's
on screen is too honest and from the heart to totally dismiss but too
slick and contrived to completely embrace. This is a film that cares
about genuine emotion but also wants to tame it, to tidy it up and
keep it confined to quarters.</LD>
<LD>   Set in the fictional town of Cape Anne, Mass., in 1973, "Moonlight
Mile" focuses on the effects of an event we never see: the
wrong-place-at-the-wrong-time murder of a young woman named Diana
Floss, a bystander killed when a deranged man turns a gun on his
wife.</LD>
<LD>   Left to sort through the emotional wreckage are Diana's stunned
fiance, Joe Nast (Jake Gyllenhaal), and her equally distraught
parents, commercial real estate agent Ben Floss (Dustin Hoffman) and
his writer wife, JoJo (Susan Sarandon).</LD>
<TE>   How they deal with this unexpected catastrophe, the choices they
have to make about direction for the rest of their lives, is the
territory writer-director Brad Silberling wants to explore.</TE>
<TE>   Silberling, as has been widely reported, has such an event in his
own past: His girlfriend, actress Rebecca Schaeffer, was murdered by
a stalker in 1989. But even without knowing those specifics, it's
possible to feel a reality behind many of the film's themes, notions
like how critical tart gallows humor is to survival.</TE>
<TE>   Silberling has dedicated the film to "all our loves, departed or
yet to arrive" and has called what he's done "the literalization of
emotions" that he and Schaeffer's parents felt, a summation that
sounds about right.</TE>
<TE>   But Silberling also previously directed the Meg Ryan-Nicolas Cage
"City of Angels" as well as "Casper," audience-friendly films that
grossed a total of $500 million. He can dive deeply into love and
death, but his practiced style also means he is just the kind of
smooth operator the studio system is looking for.</TE>
<TE>   Joe Nast and the Flosses (a truly dreadful name) are introduced on
the morning of Diana's funeral. Joe has been staying with his future
in-laws for some weeks, preparing for a wedding that is now not to be
and a trip to Italy that will never take place. His life has been
thrown for a terrible loop, and he is increasingly desperate to
figure out just what he should be doing with his future.</TE>
<TE>   Gyllenhaal, a young actor who's been notable in small films like
"October Sky," "Donnie Darko" and "Lovely &amp; Amazing," plays Joe.
Despite his high-powered co-stars, his is the role that has to carry
the picture, and this gifted, accessible actor is fully up to the
task. With a sly smile and a natural vulnerability, Gyllenhaal easily
handles the sadness, the anger and the sense of humor needed to make
his character's plight individual and not generic.</TE>
<TE>   As for Joe's once-but-not-future in-laws, the results are more
mixed. While Sarandon's JoJo is one of the film's most refreshing
characters, Hoffman's Ben is considerably less so.</TE>
<TE>   Forthright, honest to a fault, willing to say just about anything,
JoJo is a bracing character, one who really feels created from the
inside.</TE>
<TE>   Her brisk "Let's dish" at the close of the long and trying funeral
day, her insistence on literally tossing well-meaning books like
"Grieving for Grown-ups" and "These Things Happen" into the fire, all
point to a woman unwilling to forgo either anger or biting humor in
her self-defense. Despite how often we've seen her, Sarandon still
manages to bring a sassy and unexpected quality to her strong
portrayal.</TE>
<TE>   The difficulty with Hoffman's Ben, on the other hand, goes beyond
the fact that he is the more pliant partner, an accommodating
"funerals are awkward at best" kind of guy. Although the actor has
tried hard to connect to the role, he hasn't found the character and
can't get past a kind of "Death of a Salesman Lite" rendition.</TE>
<TE>   Just as much a problem is that the plot strand involving Ben,
which has young Joe joining the older man in his real estate business
as previously planned, feels extraneous. More successful, at least in
part because Holly Hunter is quite effective as an assistant district
attorney, is the strand that deals with the legal fate of the man who
killed Diana.</TE>
<TE>   "Moonlight Mile" has yet another strand and, like the rest of the
film, it is both charming and frustrating. Headed to the local post
office to reclaim wedding invitations before they're mailed, Joe
makes the spirited acquaintance of postmistress-bartender Bertie
Knox.</TE>
<TE>   As played by Ellen Pompeo in a terrific major studio debut (Steven
Spielberg's upcoming "Catch Me if You Can" is on her agenda), Bertie
has presence, moxie and a great sense of humor to go with her good
looks. True, she turns out to have issues of her own, but you don't
have to be Carnac the Magnificent to divine that that postal
cute-meet is not the end of things between these two.</TE>
<TE>   How you feel about the direction of the Joe-Bertie relationship in
particular and the entire "Moonlight Mile" scenario in general
depends on your feelings about the Hollywoodization of emotion. The
reported nine years it's taken to get this film set up at a major
studio says more about the timidity of Hollywood than the nerviness
of what's been attempted. Silberling has crafted a good number of
strong, memorable moments--a barroom dance set to the Rolling Stones
title song is particularly nice--but finally the presence of real
feelings underlines what's missing when they're not there.</TE>
<TE>   MPAA rating: PG-13, for some sensuality and brief strong language.

<HD>Ribald, Satiric 'Pantaleon' Overstays Its Welcome</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KEVIN THOMAS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"Pantaleon y las Visitadoras" is a sexy, exuberant (if overly long)
tale that Peruvian director Francisco J. Lombardi and his writers
have deftly adapted from a 1973 novel by their distinguished
countryman Mario Vargas Llosa.</LD>
<LD>   The film's Miami-based distributor, Venevision International, is
clearly hoping to cash in on the crossover success of "Y Tu Mama
Tambien." But while "Pantaleon" does have its scorching erotic
moments and skewers establishment hypocrisy toward prostitution, it
lacks the originality and complexity of "Y Tu Mama."</LD>
<LD>   "Pantaleon" is an entertaining, ribald comedy that develops some
dark and telling undertones. Capt. Pantaleon Pantoja (Salvador del
Solar) is as impossibly handsome and clean-cut as he is the epitome
of the dedicated and efficient career officer. He is therefore deemed
perfect for the undercover assignment of organizing a group of
prostitutes to be transported down the river into the Amazon jungle
so the soldiers stationed there will stop targeting the local girls.</LD>
<TE>   Pantoja is taken aback, but only momentarily, by the order he
cannot refuse and teams up with a madam, Chuchupe (Pilar Bardem,
mother of Oscar-nominated Javier Bardem), who's going broke, unable
to compete with those local girls the troops either seduce or take by
force. Quite rapidly, Pantoja has Chuchupe and her girls eagerly
plying the waters to their profit and the army's.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, it's all too good to be true. How can Pantoja's
superiors expect the operation not to attract the attention of locals
and the media? How can starting up and overseeing such an operation
not exact a strain on Pantaleon's marriage to the demure Ponchita
(Monica Sanchez), especially when the awesomely voluptuous and
seductive Colombiana (Angie Cepeda) starts zeroing in on him?</TE>
<TE>   Del Solar, in an admirable portrayal, takes Pantoja from a prim
by-the-book type who develops empathy and respect for the brassy,
good-hearted Chuchupe's hard-working girls and reveals himself to be
a man of steadfast principle and conviction.</TE>
<TE>   "Pantaleon" is a sure-fire mix of sex and broad satire, humor and
hypocrisy, but with a running time of nearly 2 hours and 20 minutes,
it's way too much of a good thing.</TE>
<TE>   MPAA rating: R, for strong sexuality, nudity and language. Times
guidelines. steamy and suggestive and decidedly adult.</TE>

<HD>Aetna Will Cut 9% of Its Work Force</HD>
<DH>Insurance: Elimination of 2,750 jobs is latest step by firm
to turn itself around after losses.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Health insurer Aetna Inc. said Thursday that it would cut about 9% of
its work force to mirror its shrunken health-plan membership as it
reins in costs to become more competitive.</LD>
<LD>   The second-biggest U.S. health insurer said it would take an
after-tax charge of $58 million in the third quarter to cover costs
of eliminating 2,750 jobs. After these cuts, Aetna will employ about
28,000 workers.</LD>
<LD>   The Hartford, Conn., insurer is trying to turn itself around after
a string of losses in recent years. Aetna became profitable this year
after losing money in every quarter in 2001.</LD>
<TE>   "They've had two decent quarters this year, and this is part of
the turnaround," said Dan Gillespie, portfolio manager at the Rydex
Health Care Fund.</TE>
<TE>   The action by the 150-year-old insurer is the latest in a series
of moves to become more profitable since selling its
property-casualty operations in 1996 and reinventing itself as a
health-care specialist. Chief Executive John Rowe came aboard in
September 2000, shortly after Aetna agreed to sell its financial
services and international businesses to Dutch banking and insurance
giant ING Groep.</TE>
<TE>   Aetna also is in the midst of completing a separate round of
layoffs--of about 4,400 jobs--announced in December. About 1,000 of
those jobs have yet to be cut, Aetna spokesman Fred Laberge said.</TE>
<TE>   Aetna shares closed up 41 cents at $37.78 on the New York Stock
Exchange.</TE>

<HD>Costa Mesa Firm ARV Sued Over Buyout Bid</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL>WILMINGTON, Del.</DL>
<LD>ARV Assisted Living Inc., which operates 59 communities for the
elderly in 11 states, on Thursday was facing three lawsuits filed by
investors who want a higher price for their shares in a proposed
buyout by a rival company.</LD>
<LD>   It was on Monday that an offer was made by an affiliate of Lazard.
New York-based Lazard, the world's largest private investment bank,
owns 47% of ARV.</LD>
<LD>   The affiliate, Prometheus Assisted Living, offered to pay up to
$3.60 in cash for the outstanding shares, a 41% premium over Monday's
closing price of $2.55, valuing the company at $62.8 million.</LD>
<TE>   In one of three lawsuits filed in Delaware Chancery Court, ARV
shareholder Mark Levy says the directors of the Costa Mesa-based
company have a duty to get a better price for shareholders.</TE>
<TE>   "The consideration to be paid is unconscionable, unfair and
grossly inadequate" considering ARV's "earnings power, present and

<HD>Callaway Issues Warnings for Third Quarter, Year</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Callaway Golf Co. appeared to be nearing the rough after warning
Thursday that its third-quarter and full-year revenue and profit will
fall short of targets.</LD>
<LD>   Sales of its new titanium driver, it said, may not offset softness
in the golf equipment business.</LD>
<LD>   Citing weak consumer spending in the United States, Japan and
elsewhere, Callaway sees third-quarter sales of $155 million to $160
million and earnings per diluted share of 13 cents to 15 cents. For
the year, Callaway expects sales of $750 million to $760 million and
per-share earnings of 85 cents to 90 cents.</LD>
<TE>   The Carlsbad, Calif.-based firm's third-quarter and full-year
results will include a reversal of about $17 million of warranty
reserves pursuant to a review announced and begun by the company in
July. That was partially offset by inventory reserves of about $3
million on ERC II and Big Bertha C4 premium drivers.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts polled by Thomson First Call had expected a quarterly
profit of 20 cents a share on revenue of $193.2 million.</TE>
<TE>   For 2002, analysts' average forecasts call for the golf equipment
maker to earn $1.09 a share on total sales of $812.3 million. In
2001, Callaway earned $1.02 on total revenue of $816.2 million.</TE>
<TE>   Callaway shares Thursday rose 24 cents to $13.44 on the New York
Stock Exchange before the news was announced.</TE>

<HD>Higher Price Cap for State's Power on Hold</HD>

<BD>BLOOMBERG NEWS</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Federal regulators delayed raising California's power price caps by a
month, after state electricity officials said they needed more time
to test a computer program that automatically detects price
manipulation.</LD>
<LD>   A price cap of $91.87 a megawatt hour, established last year to
ease California's energy crisis, was extended through Oct. 30, the
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission said in an order. In July, the
commission ordered the California Independent System Operator to
raise the cap to $250 on Oct. 1, part of a plan to restructure the
state's wholesale power markets.</LD>
<LD>   The system operator, which oversees the state's power grid, had
said it needed the delay to ensure consumers are protected from price
gouging until the program was installed and tested. Mirant Corp. and
Duke Energy Corp. had opposed the request.</LD>
<TE>   The extension was granted because of the system operator's
"problems in testing and effectively implementing the automatic
mitigation procedures," the commission's order said. The delay
"provides adequate time for Cal-ISO to complete its testing."</TE>
<TE>   The commission set the current price cap in June 2001, after
California officials pleaded for relief from what they described as
gouging by generators and energy traders, including Enron Corp.</TE>
<TE>   The commission's order Thursday was "too little of the right
result, and for the wrong reason," said Gov. Gray Davis' press
secretary, Steven Maviglio. "The price caps should not be raised,
period."</TE>

<HD>More Woes for Eisner: Key Exec Takes Gap Job</HD>
<DH>Media: Paul Pressler was seen as a potential successor to
the Disney CEO. He is leaving as the firm struggles to revive
earnings, stock price.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD VERRIER and JAMES BATES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Michael Eisner's efforts to turn around ailing entertainment giant
Walt Disney Co. were dealt an unexpected blow Thursday when his theme
park chief and loyal lieutenant, Paul Pressler, was hired to revamp
the troubled Gap Inc. clothing chain.</LD>
<LD>   Pressler said his decision to succeed retailing legend Millard
"Mickey" Drexler stems from his desire to advance his career by
becoming a chief executive.</LD>
<LD>   "It was a gut-wrenching decision," he said. "I wasn't looking for
the job. I wasn't looking to leave Disney."</LD>
<TE>   Still, the move couldn't come at a worse time for Chief Executive
Eisner, who has seen a parade of top executives leave in recent
years.</TE>
<TE>   Pressler had been viewed by some as a potential successor to
Eisner. His departure is likely to revive criticism from investors
and some board members that the CEO has not mapped out a clear
succession plan.</TE>
<TE>   Prudential Securities analyst Katherine Styponias said in a report
that Pressler's departure "is likely to raise the succession issue in
the minds of investors."</TE>
<TE>   Eisner, facing one of the most difficult chapters in his 18-year
tenure, is losing one of his rising stars, a tightfisted manager,
while immersed in a struggle to placate shareholders and directors
frustrated with the company's lagging stock price and earnings.</TE>
<TE>   Just Tuesday, Eisner weathered an uncomfortable five-hour board
meeting full of pointed questions on how he plans to solve the
company's problems.</TE>
<TE>   High on Eisner's list of challenges are theme parks, whose
performance is especially critical if he is to succeed. A severe drop
in tourism stemming from the soft economy and last year's terrorist
attacks has pushed vacation bookings down 10%. In addition, the
$1.4-billion Disney's California Adventure in Anaheim has failed to
live up to expectations since debuting early last year.</TE>
<TE>   The division's importance to the company was underscored when
Disney's stock went into a tailspin in August after Disney warned
that results would be bleaker than expected.</TE>
<TE>   Disney's theme park problems are especially significant given that
the unit is usually Disney's most consistent breadwinner. It accounts
for $1 out of every $3 of Disney revenue and has served as a company
cornerstone since Walt Disney christened Disneyland in 1955.
Encompassing Disneyland, Disney World, hotels, cruise ships as well
as theme parks in Asia and Europe, the division last year generated
$7 billion in revenue and $1.6 billion in income.</TE>
<TE>   Pressler's departure was disclosed to top Disney executives in an
e-mail late Wednesday by President Robert Iger. The news is
especially painful to Eisner because Pressler has been a favorite
since joining Disney 15 years ago. Before that, he worked briefly in
the toy industry and helped produce the 1985 animated "Care Bears
Movie." In his autobiography, "Work in Progress," Eisner lauded
Pressler as "a natural, charismatic leader with strong creative
instincts." In a statement Thursday, Eisner called Pressler "a
tremendous asset" to Disney.</TE>
<TE>   Pressler, whose office is down the hall from Eisner's on the top
floor of the Team Disney building in Burbank, was among a handful of
executives often mentioned by analysts as potential successors.</TE>
<TE>   He was well-liked by Wall Street and his subordinates. Pressler is
credited with guiding the theme parks through tough times caused
largely by events beyond his control.</TE>
<TE>   "This is an inopportune time for Disney. Pressler was one of
Michael's top lieutenants. Disney can ill afford to miss a step in
this world right now," said Jordan Rohan, analyst with SoundView
Technology Group and a former Disney executive.</TE>
<TE>   But many employees and customers chafed at Pressler's relentless
cost-cutting measures, such as closing rides and shows early, cutting
customer service training and making some workers wash their own
uniforms. At Disneyland, Pressler tried to end a discount program for
the disabled, but relented after a backlash. Last year, Disney cut
4,000 jobs, the bulk of which were in the theme parks.</TE>
<TE>   "We have a responsibility to create value for shareholders. I
think we've done a good job making the right choices. In a few
instances, we have cut too far, but we've adjusted," Pressler said.</TE>
<TE>   Disney expects to announce a replacement by next week. Among the
leading candidates are Walt Disney World Resort President Al Weiss, a
30-year veteran; Disneyland President Cynthia Harriss; and Disney
Cruise executive Matt Ouimet.</TE>
<TE>   Pressler, 46, was consistently on the short list of executive
recruiters. He confirmed in an interview that he recently spurned
overtures from AOL Time Warner Inc. Pressler said that he turned down
Gap when first approached and that Eisner tried to persuade him to
stay. He said he sought no assurances that he would someday become
Disney's chief executive.</TE>
<TE>   Former Disney executive Stephen B. Burke, president of Comcast
Cable Communications Inc. and one of Pressler's best friends, said
the opportunity to head Gap was too tempting for the young executive.</TE>
<TE>   "When you have a chance to be the CEO of a business this large
that has as many interesting facets, it's an opportunity that is very
difficult for someone to pass up," Burke said.</TE>
<TE>   Pressler's departure is the latest in a series of high-level
defections that have long plagued Disney as executives leave for
better jobs, depart out of frustration or have been removed.</TE>
<TE>   "There's no surprise that there's quality, senior people leaving
Disney. It's in a state of flux right now. Really good people are
leaving the company," said William Simon, managing director of
executive recruiter Korn/Ferry International's entertainment and
media practice.</TE>
<TE>   Pressler first won praise at Disney's consumer products unit and
for expanding the chain of Disney Stores. In 1994, he was tapped to
run Disneyland, commuting to Anaheim from his home in Pacific
Palisades. During the four years at Disneyland, Pressler was credited
with boosting profit even when attendance fell, in part because of
his cost cutting.</TE>
<TE>   He was promoted to president of the theme park division in 1998
and became its chairman two years later. He oversaw the biggest
expansion in the company's history with the opening of three parks in
18 months: California Adventure, Tokyo DisneySea and another Disney
park near Paris. He also was instrumental in Disney's plans to build
its first theme park in China.</TE>
<TE>   Pressler also oversaw Disney's plans to make Anaheim a major
tourist destination, working with city officials on public works
projects to accompany California Adventure. As part of that effort,
he oversaw the company's struggling Anaheim Angels and Mighty Ducks
of Anaheim sports franchises.</TE>
<TE>   "I think he set a higher standard for the appearance of the resort
area," Anaheim Mayor Tom Daly said, "and the city wanted to make the
resort area more attractive, more convenient for pedestrians. We
wanted to upgrade it. And he was an enthusiastic partner in that
upgrade process."</TE>
<TE>   But the Anaheim strategy has stumbled. California Adventure has
fallen well short of its original attendance target of 30,000 people
a day. In a recent interview with The Times, Pressler said the park
suffered from perception problems he did not see. Although the park
was originally billed as a hipper alternative to Disneyland, many
guests were clearly not interested.</TE>
<TE>   "We took some chances, tried to do some things a little
differently, and they didn't all work," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Times staff writers Claudia Eller, Bonnie Harris, E. Scott Reckard
and Kimi Yoshino contributed to this report.</TE>

<HD>Economy Receives Upbeat News</HD>
<DH>Statistics: Government reports unexpected figures on
jobless claims, orders for durable goods and sales of new homes.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The U.S economy Thursday showed signs of strength for the first time
in two weeks as claims for unemployment benefits took their biggest
drop in two months, orders for durable goods declined less than
expected and new-home sales increased.</LD>
<LD>   The government reported the number of jobless claims decreased
24,000 last week, the biggest drop since mid-July, and durable-goods
orders fell 0.6%. Economists had expected August orders to decrease
3%. New-home sales unexpectedly rose last month to a record rate of
996,000.</LD>
<LD>   Investors have faced a series of reports indicating the economy is
faltering, including declines in manufacturing, consumer confidence
and the index of leading indicators.</LD>
<TE>   The most recent statistics to indicate accelerating growth came in
the Commerce Department's Sept. 13 retail report, which showed three
straight monthly increases in sales.</TE>
<TE>   By contrast, the drop in jobless claims was five times that
expected by economists. Claims fell to 406,000 in the week ended
Saturday, the Labor Department said. Still, it was the fifth week in
a row that claims totaled more than 400,000, a level some economists
say indicates the economy is losing jobs.</TE>
<TE>   The number of workers continuing to collect unemployment benefits
rose to 3.7 million during the week that ended Sept. 14, the highest
in two months.</TE>
<TE>   The decrease in orders to $178.4 billion for durable goods--items
made to last at least three years--followed a revised 8.6% rise the
previous month, the Commerce Department said. August orders declined
for machinery, computers and cars, while demand rose for commercial
aircraft and electrical equipment.</TE>
<TE>   Sustained spending by consumers will underpin manufacturing and
keep the economic recovery intact, economists said.</TE>
<TE>   "Consumer spending growth was strong in the third quarter and
that's enough to keep orders growing," said Robert T. McGee, chief
economist at U.S. Trust Corp. in New York.</TE>
<TE>   Excluding transportation, orders fell 0.9% last month after a
revised 3.1% rise.</TE>
<TE>   Orders for non-defense capital goods excluding aircraft, a measure
of business investment, rose 0.6% in August after increasing 7% the
previous month.</TE>
<TE>   Inventories of durable goods fell 0.2% last month, while unfilled
orders increased 0.4% after a 0.1% rise.</TE>
<TE>   Other statistics show manufacturing stalled last month. U.S.
industrial production dropped 0.3% in August, the first decline this
year, according to the Federal Reserve. Companies made fewer autos,
appliances and home electronics.</TE>
<TE>   Based on another report Thursday on new-home sales, builders will
sell 946,000 new homes in 2002, eclipsing the record 908,000 sold
last year.</TE>
<TE>   Rates on 30-year mortgages are at the lowest levels in a
generation, bolstering home sales and keeping the economy going at a
time other industries are losing speed.</TE>
<TE>   Americans, stung by a third year of falling stock prices, are
buying homes as investments because houses generally have been rising
in value or, at a minimum, have retained their value.</TE>
<TE>   The report follows by one day a survey showing that existing-home
sales unexpectedly dropped in August to the second-lowest level of
the year. Sales fell to a 5.28-million annual rate. Previously owned
homes account for 85% of the market.</TE>

<HD>Prosecutors Preparing to Charge Ex-Enron CFO</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Federal prosecutors are preparing to bring criminal charges against
former Enron Corp. Chief Financial Officer Andrew S. Fastow next
week, sources familiar with the investigation said Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   The sources said fraud and possibly other charges were expected to
be brought in a criminal complaint to be filed in federal court in
Houston, probably Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   Fastow's onetime protege, former Enron executive Michael J.
Kopper, pleaded guilty last month to money-laundering and fraud
charges and agreed to cooperate with investigators as they examine
the activities of higher-ranking executives.</LD>
<TE>   Kopper was the first former officer of the energy trader to plead
guilty in the Justice Department's long-running investigation. He
implicated Fastow in three fraudulent deals involving Enron
off-balance-sheet partnerships.</TE>
<TE>   Massive losses from various Enron partnerships hid billions in
debt, inflated profit and sparked the company's bankruptcy filing in
December.</TE>
<TE>   The Justice Department, investigating Enron since January, has
been under growing political pressure to bring criminal charges
against the company's former top executives. The collapse of

<KH>DISNEY FILLS THE GAP</KH>
<HD>Retailer's New CEO Faces a Huge Task</HD>
<DH></DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Paul Pressler had a tough job at Walt Disney Co. He faces an even
tougher one at Gap Inc.</LD>
<LD>   San Francisco-based Gap, the nation's largest specialty retailer,
has suffered through more than two years of fashion and financial
missteps, going from huge profits to losses.</LD>
<LD>   Pressler, who led Walt Disney's $6-billion theme parks and resort
division that was struggling amid the downturn in tourism, must now
find a way to regain customers who have given up on Gap.</LD>
<TE>   "It's by no means going to be a walk in the park for Paul Pressler
or Gap," said Todd Slater, an analyst with Lazard in New York. "The
company grew too far, too fast, then hit a wall and has some complex
structural issues to correct."</TE>
<TE>   Pressler was named Thursday to replace retiring Gap Chief
Executive Millard "Mickey" Drexler, who led the company for two
decades.</TE>
<TE>   Pressler, 46, made his name in consumer products, and at Disney,
he rose through the ranks to run a complex, global organization.
Investors welcomed his arrival, sending Gap shares up 46 cents, or
3.8%, to close at $12.45 on the New York Stock Exchange.</TE>
<TE>   Before taking over Disney's theme parks, Pressler oversaw Disney
Stores. There, he more than doubled the number of outlets in three
years, to 335 in eight countries.</TE>
<TE>   At Gap, Pressler inherits Drexler's blue-chip franchise of more
than 4,200 Gap, Banana Republic and Old Navy stores worldwide. But
after leading white-collar America in its shift from business suits
to workplace casual chinos and sweater sets, Drexler's heralded sense
for matching merchandise to consumer trends slipped.</TE>
<TE>   Old Navy and Gap--the parent company's biggest brand--lost ground
as they veered from offering classic khakis for the family to
form-fitting fashion for teens.</TE>
<TE>   "At this stage in my career, it was an opportunity to lead what I
also think is a fantastic brand," Pressler said of his new employer.
"They have 165,000 employees around the world. This is an opportunity
that comes around once in a lifetime."</TE>
<TE>   Pressler will earn an annual salary of $1.5 million, with a
starting bonus of $885,000. He also was guaranteed a minimum bonus of
almost $1.9 million in 2003. In addition, he was given an option
grant of 5 million shares, which vest over the next seven years.</TE>
<TE>   Gap spokesman Alan Marks said company founder Donald Fisher will
maintain his position as chairman but will recommend that Pressler be
appointed to the board of directors.</TE>
<TE>   Gap's net income slipped from $1.1 billion in fiscal 1999 to a net
loss of just less than $7.8 million in fiscal 2001.</TE>
<TE>   At Disney, Pressler had limited retail experience, with mixed
results. His tenure at Disney consumer products and stores coincided
with the heyday of Disney merchandise, but in recent years Disney has
been forced to close many of the stores.</TE>
<TE>   Despite his experience with the stores, he is not seen as a
retailer, said analyst Bob Buchanan of A.G. Edwards in St. Louis.</TE>
<TE>   "He didn't grow up as a merchant, so the people who built their
careers in retailing may or may not listen to him," Buchanan said.</TE>
<TE>   At Gap, Pressler is "coming in at a tough time," Buchanan said.</TE>
<TE>   "The air is going out of the sales balloon for the industry, and
right now Gap amounts to just another high-cost provider that has
lost its way."</TE>
<TE>   Although Gap shares have fallen more than 75% since a February
2000 high of more than $53, some on Wall Street were dismayed in May
when Drexler, who has successfully steered the company through rough
patches before, announced his retirement plans.</TE>
<TE>   Still, many on Wall Street said Pressler--whose name has been
bandied about over the years as leadership positions became available
at companies as wide ranging as Target Corp. and Mattel Inc.--is
uniquely qualified to take over.</TE>
<TE>   "I think this will be a wonderful thing for the Gap," said Comcast
Cable Co. President Steve Burke, who launched and ran Disney Stores
until Pressler took over. "Paul has a very unique combination of
business expertise and a real creative spark."</TE>
<TE>   In Anaheim, Pressler was charged with stretching Disneyland into a
more alluring tourist resort where people would want to stay more
than a day.</TE>
<TE>   His management of the $1.4-billion Disney Resort expansion
prompted $3 billion in public spending to spruce up the areas around
the park and make other improvements in Anaheim, including enlarging
the Anaheim Convention Center.</TE>
<TE>   "All those things will serve well at the Gap organization," said
Ellen Schlossberg, a Gap analyst at William Blair in Chicago. "It
seems like this has the potential to be a good fit."</TE>
<TE>   Still, Disney's California Adventure has never reached its
original target capacity of 30,000 guests in one day. Critics, who
sometimes blamed Pressler for the oversights, said there was a dearth
of attractions for younger children and too much emphasis on retail
and high-end restaurants.</TE>
<TE>   Pressler had responded by announcing new attractions to be opened
within the next two years. But two restaurants already had pulled out
of the park, and many worry that the slow start has tainted the
park's reputation.</TE>
<TE>   At Gap, however, Schlossberg notes it is Pressler's global
consumer products and brand management experience that Wall Street
finds encouraging.</TE>
<TE>   And as a result of changes already enacted, Gap's position is
somewhat improved.</TE>
<TE>   Sales in stores open at least a year have been on the upswing
since June, and the company has launched a series of marketing
campaigns to drive traffic into stores, including a newspaper
circular for its value-priced Old Navy stores.</TE>
<TE>   "He could be walking in at a great time," Schlossberg said.
"Mickey has worked through and positioned the company for a
turnaround."</TE>

<HD>Gemstar Reports Loss; Delisting Hearing Today</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Gemstar-TV Guide International Inc., the publisher of TV Guide
magazine, Thursday posted a preliminary second-quarter loss of $953.8
million after more than $1 billion in asset write-downs as it
prepares for a Nasdaq delisting hearing today.</LD>
<LD>   Shares of the Pasadena company fell 11% in morning Nasdaq trading
immediately after the news, but came back a little to close at $2.90,
down 34 cents, or 10%.</LD>
<LD>   The company is subject to delisting from Nasdaq because it missed
an Aug. 14 deadline to file audited second-quarter results. The
company has yet to file its final audited results with the Securities
and Exchange Commission.</LD>
<TE>   Gemstar delayed its results while it investigated the allocation
of revenue between its interactive division and media services
sector.</TE>
<TE>   The probe, completed this month, led to the reclassification of
$2.7 million in advertising revenue from its interactive division to
its media services division.</TE>
<TE>   Gemstar said that for the second quarter, it had a consolidated
loss before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization of $54.2
million, or 13 cents per share, compared with a profit on the same
basis of $108 million, or 26 cents per share, a year earlier.</TE>
<TE>   Including write-downs of more than $1 billion for impaired assets,
it posted a net loss of $953.8 million, or $2.32 per share, compared
with a loss of $134.8 million, or 33 cents per share, a year earlier.</TE>
<TE>   Revenue in the second quarter was $271.7 million, down from $320.5
million a year earlier.</TE>
<TE>   Gemstar said it has not yet filed its audited quarterly report
because independent auditor KPMG has not signed off on the numbers.</TE>
<TE>   The company said that because of its disagreement with KPMG, it is
requesting guidance from the office of the SEC's chief accountant on
how to proceed.</TE>
<TE>   Because of adverse rulings in a number of patent cases, Gemstar
said it has decided to take a reserve of $113.5 million related to
revenue it was accruing from Scientific-Atlanta Inc. but had not
collected.</TE>
<TE>   It also said it would write down $44.4 million in capitalized
litigation costs.</TE>
<TE>   Gemstar said no action has been taken on a management
restructuring proposal by executives and Gemstar's largest
shareholder, News Corp.</TE>
<TE>   At the time of that mid-August proposal, sources close to News
Corp. said it included the removal of Henry Yuen as Gemstar chief
executive.</TE>

<HD>German Exchange to Close Neuer Markt</HD>
<DH>Bourses: The tech-heavy listings system, similar to Nasdaq,
lost almost all of its value amid scandals and insolvencies.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press and Reuters</BD>
<DL>FRANKFURT, Germany</DL>
<LD>Germany's stock exchange operator said Thursday that it will close
its tech-heavy Neuer Markt after a 2 1/2-year plunge that has wiped
out almost all the upstart market's value.</LD>
<LD>   Deutsche Boerse said dissolution of the Neuer Markt--Germany's
answer to America's Nasdaq market--was aimed in part at reassuring
investors with clear, tough new rules on corporate financial
disclosure after a series of scandals.</LD>
<LD>   Companies still traded on the Neuer Markt will shift to a more
tightly regulated listing system, officials said.</LD>
<TE>   Neuer Markt-listed firms, some of which were consulted on the
move, and stock analysts said they hoped the new structure would
bring back investors.</TE>
<TE>   "We think this is absolutely positive," said Gudrun Geissler, head
of investor relations at Pfeiffer Vacuum Technology, a maker of
vacuum pumps and one of the market's profitable companies.</TE>
<TE>   The surprise move follows the demise of the Swiss New Market
segment in July.</TE>
<TE>   The Neuer Markt's launch five years ago gave German software and
Internet companies a high-profile trading platform and helped those
companies attract billions in capital from investors.</TE>
<TE>   It also spread pro-shareholder practices such as publishing
quarterly earnings--a novelty for many German companies.</TE>
<TE>   But a string of financial scandals and scores of insolvencies
among listed companies have sullied the market's image.</TE>
<TE>   At the height of the dot-com era, firms streamed to list on the
market, sparking huge interest from German small investors--many of
whom had their fingers burned as tech stocks crashed.</TE>
<TE>   The market's Nemax All-Share index traded Thursday at 411, down
95% from its March 2000 peak of 8,140.</TE>
<TE>   By contrast, the Nasdaq composite index has fallen 76% from its
March 2000 peak.</TE>
<TE>   The number of companies listed on the Neuer Markt has fallen from
342 in June 2000 to 264 through delistings and bankruptcies.</TE>
<TE>   The Neuer Markt also was tarnished by scandals such as that of
Comroad, a navigation systems company that prosecutors say faked most
of its earnings from 1998 to 2000.</TE>
<TE>   The government, not Deutsche Boerse, is responsible for policing
market fraud, but Comroad and other scandals hurt Neuer Markt's
image.</TE>
<TE>   The German exchange will reshuffle its market structure by early
2003, putting the Neuer Markt and its SMAX small-cap segments into a
new segment called Prime Standard, in which companies will be
required to issue quarterly earnings statements and meet with
securities analysts.</TE>
<TE>   Companies that don't meet those standards will be listed on the
other segment, Domestic Standard.</TE>
<TE>   The Neuer Markt will be phased out by the end of 2003 as firms
decide which new segment to join.</TE>
<TE>   On Thursday, some of those investors who helped fuel the segment's
surge cheered the Neuer Markt's demise in Internet chat rooms. "Where
will I now be able to burn my money?" said one retail investor on the
WallStreetonline Web site.</TE>
<TE>   Fund managers said Deutsche Boerse had little hope of restoring
the battered market's image.</TE>
<TE>   "It is better to have a harsh end than to have an endless tragic
saga," said Trudbert Merkel, fund manager at Deka Group.</TE>
<TE>   "The Neuer Markt was dead anyway."</TE>

<HD>Greenspan Is Given the Royal Treatment</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL>CRATHIE, Britain</DL>
<LD>It was a day of rational exuberance for Federal Reserve Chairman Alan
Greenspan on Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   He joined a select club of American presidents, film directors and
comedians when Queen Elizabeth II awarded him an honorary knighthood.
Greenspan, 76, received the honor and a cross-shaped medallion for
his "outstanding contribution to global economic stability" at a
ceremony at Balmoral Castle, the British royal family's Scottish
residence.</LD>
<LD>   "I deeply appreciate this honor and I will always cherish it,"
Greenspan said.</LD>
<TE>   In announcing the knighthood last month, Britain said it was in
recognition of "the benefit that the United Kingdom has received from
the wisdom and skill" of the Fed chief.</TE>
<TE>   But as an American, he isn't allowed to use the title "Sir," as
only knighted British subjects are given that honor.</TE>

<HD>Positive Reports Help the Dow to Extend Its Rally</HD>
<DH>Wall Street: The blue-chip index climbs 155 points on
upbeat news. But Nasdaq closes with a slight loss.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A slew of unexpectedly strong economic data boosted blue-chip stocks
Thursday as investors hoped a better outlook for corporate profits
would follow. But technology stocks took a breather after rallying
Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   "For the first time in what seems like months, we've gotten some
positive economic data," said Dan McMahon, head of block trading for
CIBC World Markets. "It's giving people more confidence we have
reached bottom in the economy and we might start to turn around."</LD>
<LD>   The Dow Jones industrial average gained 155.30 points, or 2%, to
7,997.12. It was the second straight triple-digit gain for the Dow,
which hit a four-year low Tuesday. The widely watched index crossed
the 8,000-mark during the day but couldn't close above it. The broad
Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index climbed 15.29 points, or 1.8%, to 854.95.</LD>
<TE>   The tech-laden Nasdaq composite index eased less than a point, or
0.1%, to 1,221.61, after dropping to a six-year low earlier in the
week. It surged 3.4% on Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   Although the Nasdaq closed slightly lower, winners outnumbered
losers on the market by a 6-5 margin. On the New York Stock Exchange,
three stocks rose for every one that fell. Trading was active.</TE>
<TE>   Investors welcomed the two-day rally after fears about a possible
U.S. war on Iraq and the fragile economic recovery drove the market
lower for four straight weeks. According to reports Thursday, orders
for durable goods dipped in August, but the drop was smaller than
expected; new jobless claims declined for the second straight week;
and sales of new U.S. homes rose to a record level in August.</TE>
<TE>   Yet apprehension about armed conflict with Iraq persists, analysts
said.</TE>
<TE>   Bond yields, meanwhile, ended little changed after initially
jumping on the positive economic news. The yield on the benchmark
10-year Treasury note rose as high as 3.83% but closed at 3.77%, up
from Wednesday's close of 3.75%. Bond yields surged Wednesday as
investors fled yields that are at 40-year lows and hunted for
bargains among beaten-down stocks.</TE>
<TE>   "As we approach the end of the month, which has been one of the
worst in recent memory, investors and institutions are beginning to
rotate funds into sectors they believe may do better over the next
few quarters," said Alan Ackerman, chief market strategist at
Fahnestock &amp; Co.</TE>
<TE>   The Dow average has fallen 7.7% this month, on track for its worst
monthly performance since September 2001. The average has fallen for
six straight months.</TE>
<TE>   Monday is the last day of the third quarter, which could bring
swings in the market as money managers dress up their portfolios by
dropping the quarter's losers and adding winners. This quarter, the
Dow has declined 13.5%, the S&amp;P 500 has dropped 13.6% and Nasdaq has
fallen 16.5%.</TE>
<TE>   In other highlights Thursday:</TE>
<TE>   * Nokia, the world's largest mobile phone maker, rallied 56 cents
to $13.81 on the company's forecast of rising mobile phone shipments
next year. Some computer chip stocks, however, were pummeled after
Salomon Smith Barney cut earnings estimates on several communications
chip makers, including Broadcom, PMC-Sierra and Applied Micro
Circuits. Broadcom slumped $2.04 to $11.86, PMC-Sierra dropped 3
cents to $4.14 and Applied Micro fell 32 cents to $3.17.</TE>
<TE>   * Gold stocks were among the worst performers in the S&amp;P 500 index
after Barrick Gold, one of the world's biggest gold producers,
lowered its 2002 and third-quarter earnings forecasts, blaming lower
gold production and higher costs. It slumped $1.87, or 11%, to
$15.90. Gold prices fell for a second day, dipping $1.90 to $320.30
in New York trading.</TE>
<TE>   * General Motors jumped almost 5%, helping to boost the Dow, after
GM Europe chief Mike Burns said in an interview with Reuters that
GM's European unit is on track to break even in 2003 as new products
and cost cutting boost profit. GM gained $1.95 to $41.52.</TE>
<TE>   * Oil stocks also gave the market a lift as crude oil prices clung
near 19-month highs, above $30 a barrel. Exxon Mobil rose $1.54 to
$34.15 and oil-services giant Schlumberger gained $2.21 to $41.</TE>
<TE>   * European markets were generally higher. Key indexes rose 4.2% in
Britain, 6.3% in France, 3.2% in Italy and 2% in Germany.</TE>
<TE>   * Cendant sank 50 cents to $10.75 after the company said it will
write down the value of its mortgage servicing assets due to a
refinancing surge.</TE>

<HD>Faneuil May Testify; Stewart Shares Fall</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Shares of Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia Inc. fell in trading
Thursday after a published report said an assistant at Merrill Lynch
&amp; Co. has agreed to plead guilty to a misdemeanor and testify against
Martha Stewart and others in the federal investigation of stock sales
in ImClone Systems Inc. last year.</LD>
<LD>   The Wall Street Journal reported that prosecutors had sought to
charge the assistant, Douglas Faneuil, with a felony for making false
statements to investigators but later agreed to a misdemeanor charge
in exchange for his cooperation. The newspaper cited people familiar
with the discussions.</LD>
<LD>   The charge is expected to be filed within days.</LD>
<TE>   Shares of Martha Stewart Living declined 60 cents, or 7.7%, to
close at $7.20 on the New York Stock Exchange.</TE>
<TE>   Through his lawyer, Faneuil declined to comment, as did the U.S.
attorney's office in New York. A spokesperson for Stewart also
declined to comment Thursday, but in the past she has denied
wrongdoing.</TE>
<TE>   Merrill Lynch handled Stewart's sale of nearly 4,000 ImClone
shares in late December, shortly before the company announced that
federal regulators would not review the company's cancer drug
Erbitux.</TE>
<TE>   Stewart has said she had a standing order with her broker, Peter
Bacanovic--for whom Faneuil worked--to sell the ImClone shares if
they fell below $60. Faneuil, 26, initially gave investigators the
same account but later changed his story and said there had been no
such order.</TE>
<TE>   The misdemeanor charge involves a gift Faneuil accepted from
Bacanovic in exchange for corroborating the account about the
stop-loss order to federal investigators, the Journal said.</TE>
<TE>   The newspaper said it was not certain that charges would be filed
against Stewart, and people familiar with the investigation told the
Journal no charges were imminent.</TE>
<TE>   Faneuil's plea deal, which remains subject to change, will not be
final until it is entered in federal court.</TE>

<HD>Lower Mortgage Rates Could Raise the Roof on Sales, Prices</HD>
<DH>Homes: The drop to 5.99% is the seventh new low since
November. Refinancing is expected.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DARYL STRICKLAND</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>With mortgage rates tumbling Thursday to the lowest level in more
than three decades, even more buyers are expected to be drawn into
the tight, competitive Southern California housing market and perhaps
push prices to new records.</LD>
<LD>   The average rate on long-term mortgages edged down Thursday to
5.99% from 6.05% last week, Freddie Mac reported. Borrowing costs for
30-year loans have fallen to the lowest point since 1965 when rates
were at 5.83%, the secondary mortgage investor said.</LD>
<LD>   Thursday's cut marked the seventh new low for mortgage rates since
November. The falling rates have prevented more people from being
priced out of the housing market by rapidly rising prices, said
Robert Bailey, president of the California Assn. of Realtors.</LD>
<TE>   The slight decline is expected to keep Southern California sales
churning steadily, particularly for entry level buyers, analysts
said.</TE>
<TE>   When measured in August, the supply of homes for sale in Orange
and Los Angeles counties would have lasted less than three months if
no more came on the market. A nine-month supply is considered
healthy, the Realtors group said. Median home prices, meanwhile, rose
in August to a record $370,000 in Orange County and to $267,000 in
Los Angeles County as the tight supply encouraged bidding wars.</TE>
<TE>   For KB Home, one of the nation's largest homebuilders, cheaper
financing is expected to allow more consumers to choose costlier
upgrades for their new homes. Buyers now will be more likely to
choose a two-car garage, for instance, rather than a smaller one,
said Dom Cecere, chief financial officer of the Los Angeles company.</TE>
<TE>   "It gives them more flexibility to put into a home what they could
not have afforded before," Cecere said.</TE>
<TE>   The lower rates also are expected to cause more consumers to
refinance their home loans, further clogging the busy mortgage
system. In Southern California, the pace of refinancing during the
first half of the year surged 41% to 538,496 compared with the same
period in 2001, according to DataQuick Information Systems Inc., a
real estate research firm.</TE>
<TE>   And Doug Perry, a first vice president at Countrywide Credit Inc.
in Calabasas, expects to see people who reworked their home loan in
the last six months to 18 months to refinance again with rates
falling below the 6% benchmark.</TE>
<TE>   "We've crossed a psychological barrier that will pique consumer
interest," he said. "The Southern California market remains very
strong for both refinancing and purchasing, and I think this shows
there is no end to this in sight."</TE>
<TE>   About 34% of Californians have been paying off their mortgages
early, a pace that leads the nation and shows how quickly refinancing
has been taking place, according to a new report from
LoanPerformance, a San Francisco firm that tracks mortgage data.</TE>
<TE>   All six counties in Southern California were rated in the top
third of areas surveyed nationwide, and seven California markets
ranked in the top 10.</TE>
<TE>   Mortgage rates also declined slightly for 15-year fixed rate
mortgages to an average of 5.41%, and one-year adjustable home loans
fell to 4.22%. Those loans carried add-on fees of 0.6% this week,
Freddie Mac said.</TE>
<TE>   The Freddie Mac average rate is widely quoted, but other mortgage
benchmarks already had fallen below the 6% threshold.</TE>
<TE>   A 30-year loan index tracked by the Mortgage Bankers Assn. fell to
5.85% last week from 5.90% the previous week.</TE>
<TE>   Borrowers can find conventional loans at even lower rates if
they're willing to pay upfront "points."</TE>
<TE>   Mortgage rates track yields on long-term Treasury bonds. Treasury
yields have plunged to 40-year lows in recent months as investors
have fled the stock market for safer havens.</TE>
<TE>   The yield on the 10-year Treasury note, the principal benchmark
for the mortgage market, hit a generational low of 3.64% on Tuesday,
down from 4.14% at the end of August.</TE>
<TE>   On Thursday the T-note yield edged up to 3.77%. Though many
analysts have warned that Treasury yields--and mortgage rates--could
quickly rebound if the U.S. economy begins to show more strength,
others say demand for Treasuries may remain strong because investors
fear a U.S.-Iraq war and a generally weak global economy looking into
2003.</TE>

<HD>Doctors Get Class Status for Lawsuit Against Top HMOs</HD>
<DH>Courts: Fraud claims could alter California's managed-care
system. In same decision, judge denies bid to combine allegations by
patients.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DON LEE and RONALD D. WHITE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The nation's biggest HMOs on Thursday suffered a major setback in
their long-running court battle with doctors suing them for fraud,
but they won a key victory in a companion case brought by consumers
who claimed the insurers put profits before care.</LD>
<LD>   A federal judge in Miami ruled lawyers could group the claims of
as many as 600,000 physicians into a class-action suit. In the same
decision, U.S. District Judge Federico Moreno denied class
certification to an estimated 145 million patients covered by such
health maintenance organizations as Aetna Inc. and Cigna Corp.,
meaning that patients will have to pursue claims in individual suits.</LD>
<LD>   The two cases brought together in one place much of the nation's
anger and frustration with managed health care. They have potentially
huge consequences for health insurers, doctors and consumers, who
have been battling in courts around the country over fees paid to
doctors and care given or denied to patients.</LD>
<TE>   Though the cases are national in scope, they have particular
resonance for California, which has been a pioneer in managed health
care. The California Medical Assn. was one of the major plaintiffs in
the doctors' lawsuits against the nation's major HMOs, including
WellPoint Health Networks Inc. of Thousand Oaks, Health Net Inc. of
Los Angeles and PacifiCare Health Systems Inc. of Cypress.</TE>
<TE>   "The suit, if it succeeds at this level, will mandate changes in
the payment provision of all physician contracts with health plans in
the United States," said Albert Lowey-Ball, a California-based
health-care consultant.</TE>
<TE>   Lawyers for the doctors, who accused big health insurers of
systematically cheating them of their fair payments, said the ruling
could pave the way for significant damages and changes in the
managed-care industry.</TE>
<TE>   "I feel good, I feel great," said Dr. Marcy Zwelling-Aamot, a Long
Beach internist who is active in the CMA. As a solo practitioner,
Zwelling-Aamot said she has had many frustrating days with insurers
over payments. Sometimes, she said, an insurance company would
arbitrarily cut her fees, with no explanation. "What I want is a fair
marketplace," she said.</TE>
<TE>   The HMO industry association in Washington blasted the decision,
saying it made no sense to lump together what amounted to individual
payment disputes.</TE>
<TE>   "It's certified as a giant collection action of every physician in
the United States," said Karen Ignagani, president of the American
Assn. of Health Plans.</TE>
<TE>   Representatives of several HMO companies declined to comment.
Washington attorney Brian D. Boyle, a member of the defense team,
said the decision against the HMOs would be appealed.</TE>
<TE>   "One of the principal points we'll make is that the two rulings
are fundamentally at war with each other," Boyle said.</TE>
<TE>   In his ruling, Moreno said there was evidence that suggested
commonality in the various claims brought by doctors, citing a common
practice of automated "down-coding" of medical services billed by
doctors, which results in doctors getting paid less than what they
billed. The plaintiffs have "done more than just allege a common
scheme but ... have demonstrated facts that support its existence,"
Moreno wrote.</TE>
<TE>   Archie Lamb, an Alabama attorney and co-lead counsel for the
doctors, said he could not estimate the damages that could be won
because insurance companies have closely guarded their payment
information. But he said it is easily in the tens of millions of
dollars. Lamb said he would seek to open the books when discovery
proceedings begin next year.</TE>
<TE>   Lamb said one goal of the class-action suit would be to reform how
the insurance industry operates.</TE>
<TE>   "The paramount thing is changing their business practices, the way
they process claims and dictate medical necessity," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Although Lamb and others said a victory by the doctors ultimately
would provide benefits for consumers--in providing care to the needy
and having more stable doctor-patient relations--others were
skeptical.</TE>
<TE>   "Ultimately the money here is going to be coming out of the pocket
of the people who pay the health insurance premiums and for people
with chronic illnesses," said Dr. Alan Garber, director of the Health
Services Research Training Program at Stanford University.</TE>
<TE>   In denying the class status to HMO subscribers, Moreno went along
with a fairly consistent pattern in federal courts of disallowing
groups of patients to sue their HMO. Consumer advocates and legal
experts said one reason may be that it is harder to calculate damages
in consumer health issues.</TE>
<TE>   The patient suits sought damages including treble damages under
the civil racketeering statute.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a shame that doctors who make about $200,000 can have
justice when their pay goes down and working conditions are
admittedly unfair, but patients whose lives are in the hands on these
corporations can't find their way into the court," said Jamie Court,
executive director of the Foundation for Taxpayer &amp; Consumer Rights
in Santa Monica.</TE>
<TE>   Court said his organization in the past has sought unsuccessfully
to get class certification for HMO patients involving similar denial
of care claims.</TE>
<TE>   Stocks of health insurers were mixed Thursday. Among them: Aetna
rose 41 cents to $37.78; Cigna was up $2.70 to $73.90; Humana Inc.
fell 48 cents to $12.00; Health Net was up 45 cents to $22.00;
UnitedHealth Group Inc. rose 20 cents to $87.54; and WellPoint fell
38 cents to $73.15, all on the NYSE. PacifiCare was up 18 cents to
$22.88 on Nasdaq.</TE>

<LD>After four months of tense negotiations, the dockworkers union and a
group of shipping lines late Thursday blamed each other for a
breakdown at the bargaining table that threatens to disrupt commerce
at West Coast ports as early as today.</LD>
<LD>   The International Longshore and Warehouse Union hinted at an
orchestrated slowdown. The union's negotiating committee Thursday
urged all union members to follow all safety regulations.</LD>
<LD>   The Pacific Maritime Assn., which represents shipping lines and
terminal operators, interpreted that as a call to slow work on the
docks.</LD>
<TE>   An association spokesman said significant slowdowns were seen in
Seattle and Tacoma, Wash., on Thursday, causing some ships to leave

regulators about separating their stock research and investment
banking units as a key step toward resolving multiple government
investigations of Wall Street, sources said Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   In a meeting with regulators set for this afternoon in Washington,
Citigroup Inc.'s Salomon Smith Barney brokerage will propose a
division of its research and investment banking operations as a
central component of a plan to settle probes by federal regulators,
one source said.</LD>
<LD>   Goldman Sachs Group Inc. also is among those holding discussions
with regulators about more clearly separating the two functions, to
reduce the potential for conflicts of interest, another source said.</LD>
<TE>   Wall Street firms also are discussing with regulators plans to
prevent investment banking departments from playing a role in the
allocation of initial public stock offerings. The government is
examining whether brokerages awarded coveted IPOs to corporate
executives in the late 1990s to lure banking business.</TE>
<TE>   It is unclear how a formal breakup of research and banking
divisions would work at individual companies or whether all Wall
Street firms would be willing to agree to such a plan, sources said.</TE>
<TE>   There is supposed to be a "Chinese wall" separating research from
banking. But critics say that wall crumbled during the bull market,
as bankers increasingly influenced analysts' ratings of stocks in
attempts to curry favor with corporate clients.</TE>
<TE>   The brokerage industry was embarrassed in the spring when New York
Atty. Gen. Eliot Spitzer released private e-mails from Merrill Lynch
&amp; Co. that showed some of its analysts privately disparaging Internet
stocks while publicly recommending them.</TE>
<TE>   This year the Securities and Exchange Commission approved new
rules for analyst conduct, and the National Assn. of Securities
Dealers and the New York Stock Exchange are considering additional
measures.</TE>
<TE>   But Wall Street has long opposed the idea of cleaving research
from banking, in part because stock analysis is unprofitable on its
own. The fact that such a plan is being seriously discussed
demonstrates how political sands have shifted and how eager
brokerages are to lay the multiple government investigations to rest,
experts said.</TE>
<TE>   In reaching a settlement with Merrill Lynch in May, Spitzer
considered requiring that the firm formally segregate research from
banking. But the idea was dropped, in part because of concern that it
would be unfair to require a split for just one brokerage.</TE>
<TE>   The Salomon proposal, which sources said also would include an
offer to pay a large fine to settle allegations of misconduct, will
be made to officials from the SEC, the NASD and the NYSE.</TE>
<TE>   Salomon, which has aggressively sought to settle investigations of
its research practices and allocation of stock offerings, has been
told by regulators that it must propose a reform plan with "real
change" to reach a deal, a source said.</TE>
<TE>   The SEC said Thursday that it is considering "the full range of
possible reforms" of Wall Street practices. SEC Chairman Harvey Pitt,
who some critics say has been slow to respond to Wall Street abuses,
is trying to position himself as taking a tough stance, analysts
said.</TE>
<TE>   "There is something of a regulatory competition underway and the
SEC doesn't want to look like the laggard that is always defending
the industry," said John Coffee, a Columbia University law professor.</TE>
<TE>   However, completely dividing research and banking could lead to a
major contraction of Wall Street stock research, some experts said.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not clear whether research departments could stand on their
own," said Chuck Hill, a brokerage-industry expert at Thomson First
Call in Boston.</TE>
<TE>   Also, a split that shrinks overall market research probably would
mean less coverage of smaller firms, Coffee said. An information
vacuum could make stock manipulation easier.</TE>
<TE>   Through the 1990s, research and banking units became increasingly
intertwined at many brokerages, with the highly profitable banking
units often helping to subsidize money-losing analyst operations.</TE>
<TE>   By contrast, stock research paid for itself in the 1960s and 1970s
as firms charged high trading commissions to individual and
institutional investors. That began to change in 1975 when
deregulation caused commissions to plunge.</TE>

<BD>Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>General Electric Co. reaffirmed profit forecasts but said it will
meet the goal because of gains from a unit sale and a lower tax rate.</LD>
<LD>   Chief Financial Officer Keith Sherin estimated there will be
third-quarter losses in GE's insurance business as well as costs to
exit investments in GE Equity and to restructure its power-systems
unit.</LD>
<LD>   GE expects to meet its profit estimates of 41 cents a share for
the quarter--up from 33 cents a share in the year-ago quarter--and
$1.65 for the year. Improvement in more economically sensitive
businesses "seems to have stalled," Sherin said. He declined to give
a 2003 forecast for the company.</LD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>M&amp;T Bank Corp., whose largest shareholder is Warren Buffett's
Berkshire Hathaway Inc., agreed to pay $3.1 billion for Allied Irish
Banks' 262-branch unit in the U.S.</LD>
<LD>   The stock and cash transaction would follow $691 million in
currency losses at the Allfirst Financial Inc. subsidiary this year.
The sale would help Ireland's largest bank distance itself from a
trading scandal that led to the losses discovered in February and
would enable M&amp;T to expand its commercial lending business in the
eastern U.S.</LD>
<LD>   The deal would create the 18th-largest U.S. bank with assets of
$49 billion and 713 branches in six states.</LD>
<TE>   Allied Irish shares rose $1.50, or 6.6%, to $24.20 on the NYSE.
M&amp;T shares rose $5.43, or 7.3%, to $80.11, also on the NYSE.</TE>

<LD>   Such indexes are used as a base for trading agreements between

Federal regulators are investigating whether the price of natural gas

<LD>The state Department of Corporations ordered a Santa Clarita debt
management firm to stop offering debt negotiation services because it
allegedly is operating without a license.</LD>
<LD>   Also, the state Department of Consumer Affairs warned consumers to
"proceed with caution" before doing business with the firm, Briggs &amp;
Baker. A consumer affairs spokeswoman said the warning was a response
to numerous consumer complaints received about the company.</LD>
<LD>   Debt management firms work with troubled debtors, negotiating with
creditors in an attempt to work out a repayment plan.</LD>
<TE>   Gary Brown, Briggs &amp; Baker's attorney, said the complaints against
the firm are being orchestrated by former employees who now are
competitors. He said the firm would comply with the cease-and-desist
order.</TE>

<HD>Lower Prices, Bargain Hunting Send Safeway's Profit Down 9%</HD>
<DH>Earnings: The grocery chain meets or narrowly beats
expectations, giving its stock a lift.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JERRY HIRSCH</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Lower prices for meat and food staples, as well as consumers
forsaking fancier labels for cheaper brands, caused profit at Safeway
Inc. to slide 9% in its fiscal third quarter, the company said
Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   The nation's third-largest supermarket chain, which operates under
the Vons name in Southern California, reported profit of $281.3
million, or 60 cents a share, compared with $309.2 million, or 60
cents, a year earlier.</LD>
<LD>   Sales rose 1.2% to $8.1 billion for the period ended Sept. 7.</LD>
<TE>   The Pleasanton, Calif.-based company, which operates nearly 1,800
supermarkets, matched Wall Street's expectations, lifting its stock
$2.91 a share to $23.50 on the New York Stock Exchange.</TE>
<TE>   The fact that Safeway met or narrowly beat analysts' estimates was
one reason the stock rose Thursday, said Jonathan Ziegler, an analyst
with Deutsche Bank in San Francisco.</TE>
<TE>   "Folks expect companies in this industry not to be able to make
their numbers, so they get rewarded when they do," Ziegler said.</TE>
<TE>   Safeway said it expects fourth-quarter profit to increase to 84
cents a share, the average estimate of analysts surveyed by Thomson
First Call. It earned 70 cents in the year-earlier period.</TE>
<TE>   Ziegler, however, noted that Safeway repurchased $918 million of
its stock during the quarter, which helped push its per-share
earnings ratio to match or beat estimates.</TE>
<TE>   He predicted that unless profit increases, the chain would have to
continue to repurchase shares to keep meeting its targets.</TE>
<TE>   Safeway has repurchased $2.8 billion of its stock since 1999, and
its board has authorized the repurchase of as much as an additional
$730 million.</TE>
<TE>   "The numbers really do not look great, and the sales are not where
they should be," Ziegler said.</TE>
<TE>   Comparable-store sales, a key measure of a retailer's health, fell
0.7% in the quarter.</TE>
<TE>   In a conference call with analysts, Safeway executives blamed the
results on lower prices for meat and other food, compounded by
consumers favoring lower-priced brands. That has resulted in lower
average sales receipts at the checkout stand.</TE>
<TE>   "There continues to be evidence that people have traded down" to
save money, said Steven Burd, Safeway's chief executive.</TE>
<TE>   Some consumers, he said, are buying hamburger rather than steak,
meal stretchers such as potatoes and other low-cost foods such as
rice and pasta.</TE>
<TE>   "I think that the economy got a little tougher during the
quarter," he said, adding that the period started stronger but
declined as September neared.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, discounters such as Wal-Mart Stores Inc., Costco
Wholesale Corp. and Target Corp. are continuing to steal market share
from traditional supermarkets.</TE>
<TE>   Wal-Mart, Sam's Club and Costco stores are relentless, Ziegler
said, in driving down prices on nonfood products such as cleaning
supplies and other household staples that also are found on
supermarket shelves, making it difficult for grocery chains such as
Safeway to raise prices and profit margins.</TE>

<HD>Firms Settle Saipan Factory Workers Suit</HD>
<DH>Labor: Activists say the deal will change global corporate
treatment of Third World employees.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NANCY CLEELAND</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Seven major U.S. retailers, including Gap Inc. and J.C. Penney Co.,
agreed to a groundbreaking legal settlement Thursday that attorneys
and human rights activists say will change global corporate behavior
and protect the rights of Third World workers.</LD>
<LD>   The settlement, which does not include admissions of wrongdoing,
essentially ends a lawsuit filed four years ago that alleged a
pattern of indentured servitude and other abuses at garment factories
on the island of Saipan, part of the U.S. Commonwealth of the
Northern Mariana Islands.</LD>
<LD>   The seven companies join 19 other U.S. retailers that had settled.
Together, the retailers will contribute about $20 million to a fund
that will pay back wages to several thousand workers and underwrite
an extensive monitoring program.</LD>
<TE>   Although the settlement is modest in the context of U.S. business
litigation, attorneys for the workers say it is the largest amount to
date in an international human rights case. Workers will receive back
wages of as much as $4,000--nearly a year's pay.</TE>
<TE>   More important, attorneys said, the settlement establishes a
system for independent monitoring at factories that includes
surveillance and unannounced visits as well as the training of
workers in labor rights. Monitoring will be overseen by a panel of
three retired judges who will have the authority to order payment for
back wages and to place manufacturers on probation for persistent
noncompliance.</TE>
<TE>   All 23 manufacturers that still operate factories on the island
signed the settlement. Other retailers who joined include Target
Corp., Limited Brands Inc., Abercrombie &amp; Fitch Co., Lane Bryant and
Talbots Inc. One remaining defendant, San Francisco-based Levi
Strauss &amp; Co., refused to sign but stopped doing business on the
island soon after the suit was filed.</TE>
<TE>   "The allegations are simply not true, and we believe that settling
untrue claims compromises our company's values," Levi spokeswoman
Linda Butler said.</TE>
<TE>   The litigation took plaintiffs and defendants from courthouses in
Los Angeles and San Francisco to Honolulu and finally Saipan, which
has become a garment-producing center for the United States and is
notorious for labor abuses.</TE>
<TE>   Initially, most retailers named in the suit disavowed
responsibility for practices in the contracted factories. The
settlement sets up a direct link between those retailers and the
workers, who primarily were immigrants from rural China, Taiwan and
the Philippines.</TE>
<TE>   The workers' attorneys were thrilled with the settlement.</TE>
<TE>   "It's still sinking in that we accomplished this," said lead
attorney Al Meyerhoff of Milberg, Weiss, Bershad, Hynes &amp; Lerach,
which waived more than $10 million in fees. "These were
extraordinarily difficult negotiations. Days and days in Hong Kong
hotel rooms filled with dozens of factory owners and lawyers and
retailers on one hand and labor and human rights groups on the other.
These are parties that normally can't agree on the sun coming up in
the morning."</TE>
<TE>   The seven retailers had insisted they would not settle when
earlier deals were reached, but they suffered two major legal defeats
in May. A U.S. District Court judge ruled that all garment workers on
the island could sue the retailers as a class, even though their
working experiences might have varied significantly. Judge Alex R.
Munson, based in Saipan, also allowed the earlier settlement to go
forward over the remaining merchants' objections.</TE>
<TE>   Gap, the most vocal of the seven remaining retailers, issued a
statement Thursday saying the company was "pleased to have helped
develop an enhanced monitoring program that includes remediation
efforts and has the full support of the manufacturers."</TE>
<TE>   "We've worked very hard to develop a sustainable, independent
monitoring program that complements our own efforts to achieve
sustained improvement in factory conditions over time," it said.</TE>
<TE>   Target Vice President James T. Hale said his company signed the
settlement only because litigation would have been too costly.</TE>
<TE>   "It is a sad fact that these lawsuits were never about the public
good," Hale said. "They were simply one more instance of class-
action lawyers acting as publicity profiteers by using the media to
smear a company's reputation without regard for the truth."</TE>
<TE>   The case is part of a growing body of litigation addressing
corporate behavior in an increasingly global market by using once-
obscure laws such as the Alien Tort Claims Act and the Racketeer
Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, both invoked in this case.
The suit was filed on behalf of the island's workers by the garment
workers union UNITE and several anti-sweatshop groups.</TE>
<TE>   Attorneys said the arguments they developed in the Saipan case are
being applied to other human rights lawsuits targeting international
corporations. The settlement may deter exploitative behavior
elsewhere in the Third World, they said.</TE>
<TE>   "Litigation is an unwieldy tool, but it sends a powerful message
and it gets people's attention--enough to bring them to the
bargaining table and negotiate something like this," said San
Francisco attorney Michael Rubin, who also worked on the case and
said he reduced his fees by 40%.</TE>
<TE>   As a territory, Saipan is subject to all U.S. laws. But in 1989,
to encourage economic development, the first Bush administration
loosened immigration and set a lower minimum wage, which today is
$3.05 an hour.</TE>
<TE>   Garment manufacturing on the island exploded after those changes,
as factory owners imported workers from China, Taiwan and the
Philippines. Most are young women who pay $3,000 to $5,000 to
recruiters, then spend years paying them back from meager earnings.
Many also were charged $100 a month for food and an equal amount for
lodging.</TE>
<TE>   The Department of Labor has levied many multimillion-dollar fines
against Saipan factory owners for wage and hour violations.</TE>
<TE>   "Although some progress has been made, we continue to see
substantial violations and obviously need to continue our efforts in
Saipan," said department spokeswoman Sue Hensley.</TE>
<TE>   Although monitoring has not begun, workers on the island already
have reported improvements, lawyer Rubin said.</TE>
<TE>   "We're already seeing more toilets," he said. "And hot water is
starting to be piped in."</TE>

<HD>SBC Says It Will Cut 11,000 Jobs-- 3,000 in the State</HD>
<DH>Telecom: The firm blames regulatory setbacks for a
$1-billion drop in sales. Analysts say the weak economy is a bigger
factor.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ALEX PHAM</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Blaming government regulations for slack sales, SBC Communications
Inc. said Thursday that it will cut an additional 11,000 jobs over
the next six months, including approximately 3,000 in California, or
almost 6% of its work force in the state.</LD>
<LD>   The cuts come on top of the 10,000 jobs SBC already has eliminated
this year. The San Antonio-based phone carrier, which owns San
Francisco-based SBC Pacific Bell, employs 183,000 people in 13
states, including 51,470 workers in California.</LD>
<LD>   SBC also will slash spending on network equipment by 30% to $5
billion to $6 billion in 2003, said Lora Watts, president of external
affairs for SBC Pacific Bell.</LD>
<TE>   SBC shares fell 69 cents to $21.90 on the New York Stock Exchange
in regular trading, before the job cuts were announced. The stock's
close was the lowest since early 1995. In after-hours trading shares
fell further, to $21.20.</TE>
<TE>   SBC Chief Executive Edward E. Whitacre Jr. blamed "unrealistic and
outmoded regulation" for a $1-billion drop in revenue in the first
six months of 2002 compared with the same period last year.</TE>
<TE>   Specifically, SBC wants federal and state regulators to let the
company sell long-distance phone service, scale back regulation of
its high-speed Internet access business and remove pricing
constraints for how much it can charge other phone companies for
access to its network.</TE>
<TE>   SBC Pacific Bell last week won a mixed decision from California
state officials on its application to sell long-distance service. The
Public Utilities Commission decision, which paves the way for SBC
PacBell to seek federal approval, lets the company carry
long-distance calls that originate in California to cities in other
states, but it may not be able to offer such service between cities
within the state.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts and consumer advocates disagree with SBC over whether the
company's troubles stem primarily from regulation.</TE>
<TE>   "I would say the economy is the No. 1 reason" SBC faces financial
problems, said Alex Mou, analyst with Hotovec, Pomeranz &amp; Co. in San
Francisco. "People are tightening their belts in this market, making
fewer calls, adding on fewer services."</TE>
<TE>   Another big reason: Increased competition from cable companies
that offer all-in-one packages of television, phone and Internet
service. Wireless phone companies also cut into local phone business,
Mou said. In addition, consumers who buy high-speed Internet access
are eliminating phone lines that were dedicated to slower dial-up
Internet service.</TE>
<TE>   About two-thirds of the job cuts, which will be a combination of
attrition and layoffs, will come from union employees and the
remainder from management ranks, Watts said.</TE>
<TE>   Asked whether the cuts would affect customer service, Watts said:
"We will try to maintain our customer service levels, but we face
some difficult decisions that could someday have an impact on our
service."</TE>
<TE>   Consumer advocates argue that the layoffs are unnecessary.</TE>
<TE>   "SBC is a profitable company in California," said Regina Costa,
telecommunications research director for the Utility Reform Network,
a nonprofit consumer group based in San Francisco. "At the last
public hearing, they said they had a 12.4% rate of return. They're
making money hand over fist. There's no way that SBC's economic
performance in California justifies laying off 3,000 people."</TE>
<TE>   SBC posted a $7.2-billion profit in 2001 on $46 billion in sales.</TE>

<HD>Ex-Smoker Wins Tobacco Suit</HD>
<DH>Courts: An L.A. jury orders Philip Morris to pay $850,000
in compensatory damages.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MYRON LEVIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A Los Angeles jury Thursday ordered tobacco giant Philip Morris Cos.
to pay $850,000 to a longtime smoker who is gravely ill with lung
cancer, marking the industry's fourth straight loss in California and
sixth consecutive West Coast defeat at the hands of an individual
smoker.</LD>
<LD>   The award of compensatory damages to Betty Bullock, 64, of Newport
Beach was intended to cover economic losses and pain and suffering.
Philip Morris also faces an assessment of punitive damages because
the jury unanimously found the company guilty of malice and fraud. A
separate mini-trial on punitive damages will begin Tuesday in Los
Angeles County Superior Court.</LD>
<LD>   A lawyer for Philip Morris expressed disappointment, but company
officials said they would reserve comment until the punitive phase is
over.</LD>
<TE>   Bullock's lawyer, Michael Piuze, said he was pleased and "looking
forward to the punitive-damage portion of this case."</TE>
<TE>   Bullock began smoking in the 1950s at the age of 17, and mostly
favored Philip Morris' Benson &amp; Hedges and Marlboro brands. According
to testimony, she became a heavy smoker in her 20s and continued
until about the time of her cancer diagnosis in February 2001.</TE>
<TE>   The jury of seven women and five men found that Philip Morris had
misrepresented and intentionally concealed information about the
hazards and addictiveness of its products. The company also was found
liable for making a defective product and of failing to warn Bullock
of the risks prior to the placement of warning labels on cigarettes
in the 1960s. Votes on these questions ranged from 12-0 to 9-3, the
minimum needed for a verdict.</TE>
<TE>   The case was the first to be tried in California since a state
Supreme Court decision that tobacco officials and Wall Street
analysts had hoped might get the once-invincible industry back on the
winning track. The Aug. 5 ruling barred smokers from presenting
evidence of industry deception from 1988 to 1998, when a legislative
ban on product-liability claims against tobacco firms was in place.</TE>
<TE>   However, the ruling reduced only slightly the plaintiff's arsenal
of incriminating internal documents, mostly generated in the 1950s,
'60s and '70s, and utilized by Piuze throughout the trial.</TE>
<TE>   The case also saw the debut of a defense strategy in which Philip
Morris lawyers offered minimal justification for the company's
conduct and instead hammered on Bullock's awareness of the risks and
failure to quit.</TE>
<TE>   In a radical departure from past practice, defense lawyers called
a single witness--retired company scientist Jerry Whidby--instead of
the parade of experts who usually appear in such trials. By contrast,
Piuze called a host of world-renowned authorities on smoking and
health, including British epidemiologist Sir Richard Doll and
nicotine expert Neal Benowitz.</TE>
<TE>   Industry sources said the new approach grew from a sense that
California jurors, bombarded over the years by state-sponsored
anti-smoking and anti-industry ads, are uniquely hostile to the
industry and are not receptive to arguments that it has reformed.</TE>
<TE>   Based on the conclusion that "juries in California just aren't
going to listen," defense lawyers' strategy was "to go straight to
the plaintiff, and talk about the plaintiff with every witness every
day they could," said an industry source who would not speak for
attribution.</TE>
<TE>   So while Piuze hammered away with incriminating memos, defense
lawyer Peter Bleakley argued that Bullock knew the risks and could
have quit had she tried.</TE>
<TE>   At first glance, the new strategy seems to have worked no better
than the old one, though it remains to be seen what will happen in
the punitive-damages phase.</TE>
<TE>   Three other tobacco cases have been tried in California since the
lawsuit ban was lifted in 1998. Damages in the three cases, all on
appeal, totaled $153 million.</TE>
<TE>   One of the three cases produced the largest jury award ever won by
an individual smoker--Topanga resident Richard Boeken, also
represented by Piuze. In June 2001, a Los Angeles County Superior
Court jury ordered Philip Morris to pay him $5 million in
compensatory damages and $3 billion in punitive damages. The judge
later pared punitive damages to $100 million, and Boeken, who
suffered from lung cancer, has since died.</TE>
<TE>   In Oregon, two cases filed by families of deceased smokers
produced damage awards totaling $180 million. These verdicts also are
on appeal.</TE>

<KH>DISNEY FILLS THE GAP</KH>
<HD>Departure Revives Issue of a Brain Drain</HD>
<DH>Management: Disney's near-constant turnover in the
executive ranks is troubling to experts as well as investors.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CORIE BROWN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Gap Inc.'s gain is Walt Disney Co.'s loss, one in a series that has
rattled the entertainment company's executive ranks.</LD>
<LD>   The announcement Thursday that Disney's theme park chief, Paul
Pressler, had signed on as chief executive of the clothing retailer
has again raised the issue of a brain drain at Disney.</LD>
<LD>   Executives have quit for a variety of reasons, depleting Disney's
home-grown talent and forcing the company to continually hire
executives, leaving the management ranks unsettled. The departures
also have contributed to the impression that Disney Chairman and
Chief Executive Michael Eisner lacks the ability to hang on to
executives.</LD>
<TE>   "The rapid turnover of top executives is almost always a sign of
problems," said USC business professor Warren Bennis.</TE>
<TE>   Pressler is moving on to a more powerful, better-paying position
as CEO of Gap Inc.</TE>
<TE>   And sources say there is nothing to suggest that Pressler and
Eisner enjoyed anything but a good working relationship. In fact,
some considered Pressler an eventual successor.</TE>
<TE>   But the turnover must be recognized as a problem, experts say.</TE>
<TE>   "You need stability to see long-term success," said David Lewin, a
USC business management specialist. "As a business, Disney's record
is quite mediocre," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Over the years, Disney has seen some of its alumni go on to become
some of the biggest names in business.</TE>
<TE>   Former Disney Chief Financial Officer Stephen F. Bollenbach is CEO
of Hilton Hotels Corp. Another CFO, Richard Nanula, became CEO of
Starwood Hotels &amp; Resorts Worldwide Inc. and now is executive vice
president of finance at biotechnology giant Amgen Inc.</TE>
<TE>   Eisner hired former Hollywood agent Michael Ovitz as president,
only to push him out within a year. Nickelodeon founding executive
Geraldine Laybourne had a slightly longer tenure as head of a unit
charged with creating cable television networks.</TE>
<TE>   The company's film studio has had four chairmen in the last eight
years, including Jeffrey Katzenberg, who went on to co-found
DreamWorks SKG, and Joe Roth, now chief of Revolution Studios.</TE>
<TE>   This year, after an eight-month search produced no outside
candidates, Eisner settled on movie marketing chief Dick Cook for the
job.</TE>
<TE>   "You have to have replacements ready to go, and at Disney it's not
clear that they do," Lewin said.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps most troubling, the experts said, is the fact that the
constant turnover means Disney has not been able to groom a
replacement for Eisner, a situation that has disturbed Wall Street.</TE>
<TE>   "By definition, companies with a lot of churn cannot cultivate a
successor," said Richard R. Ellsworth, a corporate culture expert at
Claremont Graduate University. "It fundamentally weakens the
corporation."</TE>
<TE>   Katherine Styponias, an analyst with Prudential Securities, said
Pressler's exit would bring Disney's "revolving-door" problems back
into sharp focus among already wary investors.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps so, said Bill Simon of executive search firm Korn Ferry
International. But there isn't a media company that isn't hampered by
either the depressed market for media properties or the continuing
economic recession, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "Disney's problems only appear somewhat bigger because they've
fallen so far," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Replacing Pressler with an executive from outside Disney will be
difficult, said Gabriella Colantoni, managing director of executive
search firm DHR International. "Paul's leaving will be a blow. He was
well-respected throughout the ranks."</TE>
<TE>   In cases such as this, Colantoni said, "management needs to
acknowledge they've got a problem, show candor. It helps."</TE>

<HD>Vivendi to Sell Art, Ex-CEO's Duplex</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL>PARIS</DL>
<LD>Vivendi Universal plans to sell its 2,500-piece art collection, which
includes works by Pablo Picasso and Joan Miro, and the New York
apartment of former Chief Executive Jean-Marie Messier.</LD>
<LD>   The sale of the art and the 5,300-square-foot apartment Vivendi
bought for $17.5 million last year is a small part of the company's
plan to shed assets worth $11.7 billion by 2004. Other assets slated
for sale include corporate jets, an Airbus and a Paris soccer club,
new CEO Jean-Rene Fourtou said.</LD>
<LD>   Messier, who was forced out in July, still occupies the apartment
at 515 Park Ave. in Manhattan. He will pay rent for the rest of the
year until the duplex is sold, Chief Financial Officer Jacques
Espinasse told reporters after speaking to a French parliamentary
commission.</LD>
<TE>   "I need to clean Vivendi up," Fourtou told the commission. "We've
inherited a lot of assets from Seagram and a lot of assets from the
Generale des Eaux," the French water company from which Vivendi
evolved.</TE>
<TE>   Vivendi acquired the art collection when Messier bought Seagram
Co. in December 2000.</TE>
<TE>   The apartment probably would rent for about $40,000 a month and
sell for about $20 million, said Patricia Burnham, president of P.S.
Burnham Inc., a Manhattan property brokerage. "Very rarely do we get
something like this in terms of its quality and prestige coming on
the market," she said.</TE>

<HD>Webcasters May Get Reprieve on Royalties</HD>
<DH>Media: Lawmaker seeks six-month delay in fees Internet
broadcasters must pay to record labels and artists.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JON HEALEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Offering a potential lifeline to hundreds of Internet radio stations,
the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee introduced a bill
Thursday to give Webcasters a six-month reprieve on the new royalties
they must pay to record labels and artists.</LD>
<LD>   Rep. F. James Sensenbrenner Jr. (R-Wis.) plans to try to push the
bill through the House next week, using a procedural shortcut
typically reserved for noncontroversial proposals, an aide said.
Under this approach, the bill must be approved by a two-thirds vote.</LD>
<LD>   At issue are the controversial royalties set by the Librarian of
Congress, who based his finding on a proposal from federal
arbitrators. Starting in mid-October, commercial broadcasters on the
Net must pay 0.07 cent per song for each listener tuned in, or $92
per listener per year for stations playing a steady diet of music.</LD>
<TE>   Hundreds of stations have shut down in the face of those fees, and
many more were expected to close rather than pay the three years of
accumulated royalties that were due Oct. 20.</TE>
<TE>   Sensenbrenner's bill would delay the royalties for six months,
giving Congress more time to consider changing the way royalties are
set. Advocates say the current system leads to unfair results, such
as the arbitrators' proposal, which was based entirely on the
royalties deal that online powerhouse Yahoo Inc. struck with the
Recording Industry Assn. of America.</TE>
<TE>   A spokesman for the RIAA said the bill came as a surprise,
"considering how productive our discussions with the Webcasters have
been." But a negotiator for the Webcasters, Kevin Shively of
Beethoven.com, said the two sides remained far apart on the two most
important issues: what the lower rate would be and which Webcasters
would qualify.</TE>
<TE>   "I would call [the bill] nothing short of a new lease on life,"
Shively said.</TE>
<TE>   Rep. Jay Inslee (D-Wash.), who had introduced a bill to change how
the royalties were set, said lawmakers "have heard all over the
country that people want to keep Webcasting alive." Although a group
of House members were trying to come up with a compromise, Inslee
said, "there just wasn't enough time to come up with a solution that
was fair to everybody ... particularly with Iraq pushing everything
else off the plate."</TE>
<TE>   RIAA officials declined to say whether they would oppose the bill.</TE>

<HD>Myers Enters Guilty Plea in WorldCom Fraud Case</HD>
<DH>Telecom: Ex-controller was a 'reluctant participant' in
firm's deception, lawyer says.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DEVLIN BARRETT</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>The former controller of WorldCom Inc. pleaded guilty to securities
fraud charges Thursday, saying he was instructed by "senior
management" to falsify records.</LD>
<LD>   It was the first admission of guilt in the multibillion-dollar
scandal.</LD>
<LD>   David Myers, 44, entered the plea in U.S. District Court in
Manhattan after telling Judge Richard Casey that he wanted to waive
his right to be indicted on the charges.</LD>
<TE>   "I was instructed on a quarterly basis by senior management to
ensure that entries were made to falsify WorldCom's books to reduce
WorldCom's reported actual costs and therefore to increase WorldCom's
reported earnings," Myers told the judge.</TE>
<TE>   "I combined with others ... to assist in the commission of fraud,"
the former executive said.</TE>
<TE>   Casey asked the defendant whether he had committed the three
crimes spelled out in court papers: conspiracy, securities fraud and
making false filings to the Securities and Exchange Commission.</TE>
<TE>   "Yes, sir, I did," Myers answered.</TE>
<TE>   Outside court, Myers' attorney, N. Richard Janis, called his
client "a reluctant participant" who had "expressed his discomfort
and displeasure with the actions being undertaken by WorldCom."</TE>
<TE>   WorldCom, which owns MCI Group, the nation's No. 2 long-distance
telephone company, filed for bankruptcy protection July 21.</TE>
<TE>   In June, Myers told WorldCom accountants that the company "could
not continue with the cost structure at the current levels and that
if the cost structure did not change, the company 'might as well shut
the doors,' " prosecutors said.</TE>
<TE>   Myers and Scott D. Sullivan, WorldCom's former chief financial
officer, were arrested in August.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors say they directed employees to falsify balance sheets
to hide more than $3.8 billion in expenses, enabling WorldCom to
report a profit when it actually was losing money.</TE>
<TE>   Myers is cooperating with authorities in the case against his
former bosses and also has agreed to plead guilty in Mississippi as
early as next week to a single charge stemming from the same
corporate swindle, Janis said.</TE>
<TE>   His client also was negotiating with the SEC to resolve civil
charges filed Thursday, Janis said.</TE>
<TE>   The SEC alleged that Myers "participated in a massive fraud that
inflated the company's earnings at the direction and with the
knowledge of WorldCom's senior management."</TE>
<TE>   The agency is seeking a permanent injunction against Myers as well
as civil money penalties, repayment of allegedly ill-gotten gains and
an order barring him from serving as an officer or director of a
publicly traded company.</TE>
<TE>   The cooperation of Myers and others increases the pressure on
Sullivan to strike a deal with prosecutors and tell them what, if
anything, former WorldCom Chief Executive Bernard J. Ebbers knew
about the accounting practices.</TE>

<HD>Philip Morris Cuts Outlook for Year</HD>
<DH>Earnings: The cigarette maker lowers its forecast on
greater competition from discount rivals.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Reuters</AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Philip Morris Cos., the world's largest cigarette maker and a major
food products company, slashed its full-year earnings outlook
Thursday, saying that despite heavy promotions of its premium-priced
cigarette brands, consumers have turned to deep-discount rivals.</LD>
<LD>   The lowered outlook, which was announced after the close of
regular market hours, sent the company's shares down sharply in
after-hours trading.</LD>
<LD>   The stock rose $1.25 to $42.73 in regular New York Stock Exchange
trading, then plunged to $38.60 after hours, the lowest price since
late 2000.</LD>
<TE>   The maker of Marlboro, Virginia Slims and other cigarettes said it
now expects per-share earnings to grow 3% to 5% this year, far below
the 9% to 11% growth range it forecast in July.</TE>
<TE>   New York-based Philip Morris blamed sharp increases in state
excise taxes and heightened consumer frugality in the United States
amid a slow economy.</TE>
<TE>   On Sept. 4, Michael Szymanczyk, chief executive of domestic
tobacco unit Philip Morris U.S.A., said the company was facing more
pressure from deep-discount cigarettes and higher prices for
consumers due to increased state excise taxes.</TE>
<TE>   Thursday's lowered earnings guidance followed a profit warning
earlier this month from No. 2 U.S. cigarette maker R.J. Reynolds
Tobacco Holdings Inc.</TE>
<TE>   Reynolds, maker of Camel and other brands, said Sept. 6 that its
third-quarter earnings would fall sharply as it boosts promotional
spending in response to increased pressure from Philip Morris.</TE>
<TE>   UST Inc., whose U.S. Smokeless Tobacco Co. is the largest U.S.
smokeless tobacco maker, also cut its earnings forecast earlier this
month, citing sluggish growth.</TE>
<TE>   Philip Morris said in July that it would spend about $350 million
to promote and market its premium cigarette brands to boost volume
and market share.</TE>
<TE>   The company now expects to spend between $600 million to $650
million on the domestic business in the fourth quarter, Chairman and
Chief Executive Louis Camilleri said.</TE>
<TE>   Spending on Marlboro is having the intended effect of boosting the
brand's market share, he said during a conference call with analysts.</TE>
<TE>   The company said faster-than-expected growth of discount
cigarettes, which exceeded 2 billion units in July, and an influx of
illegally sold cigarettes, are among the factors eating away at its
market share.</TE>
<TE>   In many states, higher taxes are pushing consumers toward less
expensive options, the firm said. "In August, the national average
state excise tax was estimated to be 65 cents per pack," Camilleri
said. "That's up more than 35%, or 17 cents per pack, since June."</TE>
<TE>   Philip Morris in 2001 spun off part of its giant Kraft Foods unit
but retains 84% ownership. However, tobacco generates the bulk of the
company's sales and earnings.</TE>
<TE>   Separately on Thursday, a Los Angeles jury ordered Philip Morris
to pay $850,000 to a 64-year-old woman with lung cancer who blamed
her tobacco addiction on the company's failure to warn her of the
risks of smoking.</TE>
<TE>   Tyco Explains Ex-CFO's</TE>
<TE>   Severance Package</TE>
<TE>   Tyco International Ltd. on Thursday said it got a great deal for a
$44.8-million severance package it paid in August to a former finance
chief who was under criminal investigation and has since been
indicted.</TE>
<TE>   People familiar with the severance paid to former Chief Financial
Officer Mark Swartz said Tyco knew he was the focus of a Manhattan
grand jury at the time the deal was struck.</TE>
<TE>   In a jolt to the honeymoon of newly named Tyco Chief Executive
Edward Breen, the sources said he was fully aware of the payout to
Swartz, who is accused along with former Chairman L. Dennis Kozlowski
of looting Tyco of $600 million since 1995.</TE>
<TE>   "We had no choice but to give up the [$44.8 million]," said Tyco
spokesman Gary Holmes, adding that Swartz received only one-third of
the money to which he was entitled. "We got him to give up $91
million even though he was entitled to it."</TE>
<TE>   While Breen has moved to clean up Tyco's oft-criticized corporate
governance practices, the severance was not disclosed in an easily
understood way.</TE>
<TE>   The payout for Swartz came during Breen's first week as CEO. Since
Breen replaced Kozlowski in late July, his tenure has been warmly
embraced by investors and Wall Street analysts who have applauded his
apparent openness.</TE>
<TE>   The nature of the payment was not disclosed in a massive filing
Tyco made last week with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Tyco
said the purpose of that disclosure was not to reveal negotiations
with company executives.</TE>
<TE>   The New York Times on Thursday first reported the terms of the
severance package.</TE>
<TE>   The money paid to Swartz was due to him under a previous binding
agreement, and it was approved by Tyco and its compensation
committee, Holmes said.</TE>
<TE>   "He's entitled to get this money unless he's convicted of a
crime," Holmes said. "If the charges against him are proved, we will
get all the money back.... We had no legal grounds to withhold the
money paid to him."</TE>
<TE>   Tyco shares rose 23 cents to $15.23 on the New York Stock Exchange
on Thursday.</TE>

<HD>Quake Fault Under Belmont School Is Studied</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SOLOMON MOORE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As if worries about underground pollution and methane fumes were not
enough, now Los Angeles Unified School District officials are
studying whether the half-finished Belmont Learning Complex is
sitting on top of an active earthquake fault line.</LD>
<LD>   A company, hired to determine whether old oil wells beneath the
planned high school posed any dangers, this summer stumbled upon
evidence of what may be a fault about 725 feet underground.</LD>
<LD>   "Evaluation of the geology around the well suggests that a ...
fault is not unreasonable," according to the study by Schlumberger
Data and Consulting Services, a Colorado geological review firm. The
company found that the oil wells were not a problem.</LD>
<TE>   Those seismic findings are inconclusive, however, because they are
based on a review of old oil well logs and incomplete records from
other activities over the decades. But the Schlumberger report
worried district building officials enough that they asked for a more
rigorous seismic review. An active fault line beneath the school
could derail the project, say school and state officials.</TE>
<TE>   "There's an exceptionally small probability of that fault being
active," said Jim McConnell, L.A. Unified's chief facilities
executive. "But if the findings do show an active fault ... we'd have
hard decisions to make at that point. I don't know what they would
be."</TE>
<TE>   The joint venture URS/Dames &amp; Moore is conducting the seismic
review by inducing underground vibrations and then tracking the
echoes to create a geological map. The findings will be reviewed by
geologists at Caltech and by the state Department of Toxic Substances
and Contaminants.</TE>
<TE>   L.A. Unified had spent $175 million on the school project when
district officials discovered that toxic fumes under the campus might
make the school unsafe. The district abandoned construction of
Belmont in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier this year, the Board of Education voted to revive the
school project and to conduct a thorough inspection to see if its
environmental problems can be mitigated. The seismic review and
another on the growth of possibly toxic mold are due in the next few
days, McConnell said.</TE>
<TE>   If the property passes muster, finishing the school could cost the
district an additional $100 million.</TE>
<TE>   The department's chief of school property evaluation, Hamid
Saebfar, said state law prohibits schools from being built within 50
feet of an active fault line. Geological maps showed no such fault.</TE>
<TE>   The seismic study probably will be inconclusive, McConnell said,
because it is difficult to tell if deep faults are active.</TE>
<TE>   Angelo Bellomo, director of the district's Environmental Health &amp;
Safety Branch, said: "The existence of faults around downtown is well
documented. The issue is how unique are the conditions and are they
simply characteristic of the faults we already know about in the
downtown area."</TE>

<HD>25 Candidates in Valley Chart Own Strategy</HD>
<DH>Cityhood: Group plans to reach out to voters separately
from the activists who brought secession to the Nov. 5 ballot. Move
comes after consultants' resignation.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SHARON BERNSTEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Worried that the San Fernando Valley secession campaign is faltering,
about 25 candidates for office in the proposed city say they will
take matters into their own hands, reaching out to voters separately
from the activists who brought the cityhood issue to the ballot.</LD>
<LD>   The group, United Valley Candidates, has already planned a
meet-and-greet event for voters on Oct. 7, and will hold a news
conference today to describe the role members intend to play in the
overall secession campaign.</LD>
<LD>   The group, which began as an e-mail list that novice candidates
used to trade ideas, is stepping up its actions in response to the
resignation this week of the political consulting firm advising the
broader cityhood campaign, several members said.</LD>
<TE>   The firm quit because it had not been paid.</TE>
<TE>   "There is a feeling that if we sit and wait for the San Fernando
Valley Independence Committee to do everything for us, it's not going
to happen," said Armineh S. Chelebian, a candidate in the Valley's
3rd council district who helped form the group. "We want to jump up
and take the bull by the horns."</TE>
<TE>   The group was careful not to publicly criticize the cityhood
campaign, saying volunteers and campaign workers were doing their
best with limited resources.</TE>
<TE>   "I think they're trying, and I think if they had more resources
they'd be more active," said Sidney Gold, who is running in the 1st
district in Granada Hills.</TE>
<TE>   But privately, some members expressed frustration with the
consulting firm, Goddard Claussen Porter Novelli, which resigned
Wednesday, and the longtime activists running the secession effort.</TE>
<TE>   "If we're going to be victorious on Nov. 5, we have to take a very
strong stand, not only for our own candidacies, but [for] cityhood,"
said Frank Sheftel, a candy-maker who is running in the 12th
district. "We cannot be reliant on other people for that."</TE>
<TE>   The group is organizing a park event at which residents will be
able to discuss cityhood, as well as the Oct. 7 candidates' event, to
be held at Sheftel's North Hollywood candy shop.</TE>
<TE>   They also plan to campaign outside the Valley.</TE>
<TE>   Others among the 121 candidates running for mayor and council in
the proposed city are organizing themselves into caucuses. There are
also organizations of liberal candidates, women candidates and, less
formally, Latino candidates.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the caucuses plan to stay together after November to work
on local problems, even if secession loses. The offices they are
seeking will exist only if a breakup wins.</TE>
<TE>   "This group is not going away after the election," said Stephanie
Spikell, one of just 16 women running for the offices and a member of
the women's group.</TE>
<TE>   "We now have all of these women who are committed to their
communities, who wanted to focus on women's issues and who are
getting to know how politics operate," Spikell said.</TE>
<TE>   The candidates are working together despite their competition for
council seats, Spikell said. Each group has focused on some key
issues, such as women's safety concerns and services for the elderly.</TE>
<TE>   "We have our own vision for the Valley, and whether or not the
Valley secedes from Los Angeles, we're going to continue that
vision," said council candidate Oscar Mendoza, who is running in the
2nd district and is part of the informal Latino group.</TE>
<TE>   Last week that group held a breakfast in North Hollywood, and
members promised to try to improve conditions in the heavily Latino
northeast Valley, regardless of the election outcome.</TE>
<TE>   "We said that we candidates would work together to bring more
economic opportunities, improve public safety and also work with
other candidates who get elected, whether in a Valley city or in Los
Angeles," Mendoza said.</TE>
<TE>   The women's caucus has held one event--a news conference to
discuss crime and streetlights in the Pacoima area.</TE>
<TE>   "We're looking at the problems of the Valley from a woman's
perspective," said Terry Stone, who founded the 16-member caucus.</TE>
<TE>   Richard Katz, chairman of the San Fernando Valley Independence
Committee, said he welcomed the formation of the caucuses.</TE>
<TE>   But he added that he would like to see the United Valley
Candidates concentrate their efforts in the Valley, rather than in
the Los Angeles Basin.</TE>
<TE>   Secession needs a majority vote both in the Valley and in Los
Angeles at large to win in November. Katz said the Valley
Independence Committee is relying on a high turnout of secession
supporters in the Valley to carry the citywide vote.</TE>

<HD>Finalists Get Tough Questions From Hahn</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BETH SHUSTER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Los Angeles Mayor James K. Hahn grilled three candidates for chief of
the Los Angeles Police Department this week, attempting to assess
their political skills, labor relations talents and management
experience with pointed questions formed after conversations with
more than a dozen friends and associates.</LD>
<LD>   According to people inside the sessions and others who have spoken
to them, Hahn questioned former New York Police Commissioner William
Bratton about his turbulent relationship with former Mayor Rudolph W.
Giuliani and how he would get along with Los Angeles' civilian
leadership.</LD>
<LD>   Former Philadelphia Police Commissioner John Timoney was asked
about his rocky relationship with the police union there, and Hahn
pressed him for details about how he would relate to the union here.</LD>
<TE>   And Hahn asked Oxnard Police Chief Art Lopez about his ability to
lead an organization of 9,000 officers after running a department of
just 200.</TE>
<TE>   "The point was to take whatever bothers you the most about that
particular person ... [and] hit those issues straight-on," said
former Police Commissioner Dean Hansell, who has advised the mayor
and several current commissioners on LAPD issues. "I think what I was
saying mirrored his own views."</TE>
<TE>   Preparing for the interviews, Hahn reached out to more than a
dozen advisors and civic leaders. Most said they offered the mayor
their views and reactions without specifically endorsing any one of
the candidates.</TE>
<TE>   But billionaire businessman and Eli Broad was blunt about his
preference.</TE>
<TE>   "My advice was if he and Bratton could get along and have an
understanding with regard to Bratton's interest in being a great
public figure, he probably could not find a better person," Broad
said. "It's time to get someone who is very accomplished, who's [run]
a very big department and who has a national reputation."</TE>
<TE>   The mayor spent about six hours with each of the candidates,
meeting in the small library at the city-owned Getty House in Windsor
Square. He met with them alone, with senior staff and with two City
Council members.</TE>
<TE>   "He continuously came back to the things he's articulated over and
over again," said Tim McOsker, the mayor's chief of staff. "Civilian
control, bringing down crime, morale and relating to the troops."</TE>
<TE>   Hahn is a lawyer, and McOsker said the mayor "knows how to spend
time with a witness."</TE>
<TE>   Now that those meetings are complete, Hahn reached out Thursday to
others who know the candidates. Hahn spoke with Ed Rendell, the
former Philadelphia mayor, to discuss Timoney. Aides to Hahn said he
spoke to police supervisors in New York and Philadelphia, as well as
the city manager and city attorney in Oxnard, where Lopez works.</TE>
<TE>   In coming days, Hahn said he expects to talk with Giuliani and
Philadelphia Mayor John Street, among others.</TE>
<TE>   The Police Protective League also interviewed two of the
candidates--Bratton and Lopez--this week in an effort to better
understand their positions on community policing, officer morale and
other issues. Union leaders said they will not endorse. They are
seeking to interview Timoney, as well.</TE>
<TE>   General Questions</TE>
<TE>   In his meetings, Hahn asked each of the finalists a set of generic
questions aimed at learning how they would address his major areas of
concern. These include: reducing crime, officer morale, recruitment
and retention of officers, and strengthening community policing.</TE>
<TE>   Hahn said the three men "had similar answers on the core ideas but
very different approaches on how do you get there, how do you achieve
the goal.... Each person has their own individual way of doing
things."</TE>
<TE>   The session, Hahn added, allowed him to go beyond news accounts
and secondhand information. "I wanted to spend enough time talking to
them so we could get past the superficial answers and get to an
in-depth discussion about these issues," he said.</TE>
<TE>   But he also asked more pointed questions, attempting to get a more
specific view of each. And, according to some of those in the room
with the mayor and others familiar with the process, the mayor
repeatedly returned to those issues.</TE>
<TE>   Bratton, for instance, is credited with reducing crime in New York
City to historic lows, an accomplishment that has made him a favorite
of some Hahn supporters. Still, he also has a reputation for seeking
publicity; he had strained relations with Giuliani.</TE>
<TE>   Hahn, sources said, broached those topics with Bratton during
their meeting Wednesday, stressing the importance in Los Angeles of
civilian oversight over the Police Department. Neither Hahn nor
Bratton would say how the former commissioner responded.</TE>
<TE>   Lopez is viewed as an easygoing, former LAPD deputy chief who left
the department to head the small-town California coastal agency. But
some of Hahn's advisors warned that Lopez might not have the depth of
experience needed to head an agency as complicated as the LAPD.</TE>
<TE>   Timoney, who worked with Bratton in New York before taking the top
job in Philadelphia, is viewed as a hands-on manager who connects
with the cops on the street almost better than those in
higher-ranking positions, including union leaders. In their session,
Hahn focused on that issue, trying to discern how the former
commissioner would fit into Los Angeles' political culture.</TE>
<TE>   Although the mayor's meetings with the candidates were not heated
or tense, McOsker said they were not gentle, either.</TE>
<TE>   "People got flustered. Absolutely," McOsker said. But he said all
three were well-prepared and had appeared to use the last few months
to gain a good understanding of the mayor's concerns for the
department.</TE>
<TE>   None of the candidates would talk about their interviews Thursday,
citing a request by the executive recruiter to not talk to the news
media.</TE>
<TE>   The mayor's friends and associates said they talked to Hahn about
their general reactions to the finalists, selected by the Police
Commission, and the importance of the mayor specifically discussing
how each would manage the department.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles County Sheriff Lee Baca said he warned Hahn that the
next chief should not be allowed to eclipse the mayor, the Police
Commission or the City Council.</TE>
<TE>   "I said, 'You know, Mayor, I work for 41 City Councils, 41 mayors,
and nine community college presidents as well as the MTA board,' "
Baca said, referring to the department's law enforcement contracts.
"If I competed with their authority and powers and creativity, I
wouldn't have any contracts."</TE>
<TE>   Hahn Gets Advice</TE>
<TE>   Baca and others said they encouraged the mayor to select a chief
who will allow captains, lieutenants and sergeants to have more
authority over fighting crime in the neighborhoods they command.</TE>
<TE>   Connie Rice, a civil rights lawyer who advised Hahn, said she
believes the only way the LAPD is governable is if the captains,
lower- to mid-level sergeants and the rank-and-file accept the next
chief.</TE>
<TE>   "If they decide to clam up and just fold their arms across their
chests and let him sink like a stone ... it's all over," Rice said.
"We just can't afford it."</TE>
<TE>   Several people said they told the mayor to address Bratton and
Timoney's lack of historical knowledge of the LAPD. Bratton was part
of a team that monitored the implementation of the federally
negotiated consent decree, but Timoney has less knowledge of the city
or the department.</TE>
<TE>   Several others, including state Assembly Speaker Herb Wesson and
U.S. Rep. Xavier Becerra, said they urged the mayor to go with his
gut--rather than offering specific areas of concern. They offered the
mayor their support for whoever is selected.</TE>
<TE>   "This is one of those calls where you've got to feel like you've
hired someone who can hit the ground running," Becerra said.</TE>
<TE>   Wesson echoed that view, emphasizing that he told Hahn he would
help rally the community around whoever is chosen.</TE>
<TE>   "If this person is going to come from the outside, then those of
us who are here are going to have to do everything we can to help him
succeed," Wesson said. "We've got to give this guy a shot to win."</TE>
<TE>   He offered the mayor a word of advice, too, about knowing when
he's made his decision. "There's going to be a light that will go on
or a button that's going to be pushed in one of these meetings,"
Wesson said. "He's got to wait for that switch ... and [select]
someone with whom he feels simpatico."</TE>

<DH>Dispute: Civil service panel will consider case of two
prosecutors who say they were demoted for political reasons.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TRACY WILSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>By a narrow margin, the Ventura County Civil Service Commission
agreed Thursday to hear an appeal by two prosecutors who contend they
were demoted for backing the wrong candidate for district attorney.</LD>
<LD>   Commissioners voted 3 to 2 to hear the appeal despite arguments
that they have no authority to take up the case. An attorney
representing the prosecutors praised the decision, while lawyers for
the county called it vague and unprecedented. Retiring Dist. Atty.
Michael Bradbury vowed to challenge it in court.</LD>
<LD>   "The only grounds on which the commission has jurisdiction and can
overturn department heads is for a demotion or discharge, and this
was neither," Bradbury said. "The laws are pretty clear: They have no
jurisdiction."</LD>
<TE>   Mark Pachowicz and Adam Pearlman are fighting to return to the
district attorney's office after being transferred to the child
support enforcement division three weeks after the March 5 election.</TE>
<TE>   They contend they were transferred to child support, now a
separate county agency, as punishment for backing the candidate who
challenged Bradbury's handpicked successor. Bradbury denies those
allegations. "They were assigned there for very good reasons that may
become public knowledge," he said Thursday. "If this hearing happens,
everyone will understand the wisdom of the decision."</TE>
<TE>   On Thursday, attorney Stephen Silver urged the commission to hear
his clients' appeal, arguing that the panel must ensure that public
employees are not demoted at the "political whim" of an elected
official.</TE>
<TE>   But Leroy Smith, litigation supervisor for the county counsel's
office, told the commission that the prosecutors were not demoted. He
said the board has no authority to hear appeals to transfers.</TE>
<TE>   Under the county's personnel rules, a demotion is defined as "a
change of status of an employee from one classification to another
classification which has a lower salary range."</TE>
<TE>   Smith argued that Pachowicz, Pearlman and Vivian Rackauckas, a
third prosecutor who was transferred to child support two years
before the election, were reassigned without suffering a reduction in
pay.</TE>
<TE>   But two commissioners called the county's rules outdated and said
a pay cut is only one way an employee can be demoted. Chairman Ramaul
Rush joined them in voting to hear the appeal.</TE>
<TE>   Silver praised the commission's decision. "If public employees can
be at risk because they back the wrong candidate, what does that tell
us?" he said.</TE>
<TE>   The matter comes back to the commission Oct. 24 for further
action.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Bradbury said he directed his attorneys--county counsel
and an outside law firm--to file a writ with the Superior Court to
block the hearing.</TE>

<HD>Life Lessons From Ground Zero</HD>
<DH>9/11: Teens hear about World Trade Center tragedy from
firefighter who helped that day.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JESSICA BLANCHARD</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The teenagers listened intently as New York firefighter/paramedic
Steve Ceraulo described wading through 8 inches of debris from the
World Trade Center on Sept. 11 last year, while ash rained down "like
gray snow."</LD>
<LD>   They heard him tell of setting up a triage center near ground zero
to treat the hundreds of injured who were expected to stumble out of
the rubble.</LD>
<LD>   And they heard his voice catch when he spoke of the heartbreak of
having only one person come out alive.</LD>
<TE>   When Ceraulo finished relating his account of the terrorist
attacks to students at Adolfo Camarillo High School, the nearly 800
students gave him a standing ovation.</TE>
<TE>   Ceraulo was in Southern California this week to speak at two
community forums and to students from a dozen area schools. The event
was organized by Cops N Jocks, a community policing program that aims
to improve relations between police officers and high school
students.</TE>
<TE>   Several local teens worked with Cops N Jocks to bring Ceraulo to
Ventura County, with the goal of helping fellow students get a better
understanding of the Sept. 11 events.</TE>
<TE>   "We've done a lot of Sept. 11 stuff--we've watched it on
[television], read the articles," said Jonathan Reed, a senior at
Santa Clara High School in Oxnard. "But it's completely different to
have someone here who has trod the streets and walked through the
dust from the World Trade Center."</TE>
<TE>   Though he was running late Thursday morning, Ceraulo was loath to
leave Camarillo High for his next appearance without answering
questions from the handful of students who lingered after the
assembly.</TE>
<TE>   Among them was Geoffrey Feinberg, a seventh-grader at Colina
Middle School in Thousand Oaks, who watched wide-eyed as Ceraulo
explained the pins and insignias on his uniform and answered
questions about how the attacks had affected him.</TE>
<TE>   "It was great to talk with someone who had a firsthand look. Now I
know what really happened," said Geoffrey, who attended the speech
with his leadership class. "It moved me a lot."</TE>
<TE>   Ceraulo was on his way to a meeting near ground zero when one of
the towers collapsed. He told students about running up West Broadway
and diving behind a car to escape the cloud of debris, of not being
able to breathe, of the light disappearing as the cloud overtook him
and of the sounds of people screaming. He said he feared he was dying
and regretted that he had not told his wife he loved her the last
time they spoke.</TE>
<TE>   Those details struck a chord.</TE>
<TE>   "Hearing him talk made me realize how it affected so many people's
lives," said Santa Clara High student Yolie Vasquez, 15. "And it
makes me think about my life today, and that I need to ... appreciate
everything I have."</TE>
<TE>   Some students were stunned to hear Ceraulo tell of the extent of
the devastation. He reminded them of the size of the World Trade
Center complex and the sheer amount of steel used in the towers'
construction. Then he told them about sifting through mountains of
debris.</TE>
<TE>   "There was nothing bigger than the palm of my hand," he said.</TE>
<TE>   During his many stops, Ceraulo collected tokens of gratitude. At
Camarillo High, he was given a cap bearing the school's insignia, as
well as an embroidered jacket from the city's disaster response team.
At Santa Clara High, he was greeted with posters heralding his
arrival and presented with a collage made by the students.</TE>
<TE>   "I walk in and it's like I'm a rock star," he said. "It's
absolutely unreal, and very humbling. I'm getting all this applause
and attention for basically doing my job."</TE>
<TE>   Ceraulo said speaking with students has been cathartic, and he
hopes the teens come away with a better sense of unity and tolerance
and the realization that everyone can make a difference.</TE>
<TE>   School administrators agreed.</TE>
<TE>   "Sometimes teenagers don't make the best choices," said Carmen
Lusk, an assistant principal at Santa Clara High. "They don't think
anything bad is going to happen to them. I hope this will make them
cherish each day."</TE>

<HD>Firefighters Dig In at Mount Baldy Village</HD>
<DH>Wildfire: Fog brings some relief to besieged foothill
cities but resort town is 'in imminent danger.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SCOTT GOLD and ERIC MALNIC</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A weather system hovering off the coast sent a thick fog layer
Thursday over the Angeles National Forest, providing relief to the
foothill communities of the San Gabriel Mountains that had been
threatened this week by fire.</LD>
<LD>   But higher in the forest, the 5-day-old fire continued to move
toward Mount Baldy Village, where firefighters were preparing their
defense late Thursday. Fire officials said that depending on
temperatures, winds and humidity, the fire could arrive at the
outskirts of the village late today or early Saturday.</LD>
<LD>   The fire had grown to 32,000 acres and was 35% contained by late
Thursday. Most of the containment was on the fire's western and
southern fronts, officials said. To the north and east, flames that
have consumed 71 buildings continued to churn through heavy brush.
The cost of fighting it had risen to $8.7 million.</LD>
<TE>   As the fire approached Mount Baldy Village on Thursday from Cow
Canyon to the west and Sunset Peak to the south, crews wielding chain
saws worked to clear brush on the east side of Mount Baldy Road,
underscoring fears that the blaze would breach the only road out of
town.</TE>
<TE>   "There are too many scenarios," said San Bernardino County Fire
Capt. Jim Wilkins, a spokesman for the dozens of agencies and 3,000
firefighters called to work this week. "The village is in imminent
danger."</TE>
<TE>   The fire had closed to within a mile and a half of the village by
nightfall. Firefighters had laid down 20,000 feet of hose throughout
the village's narrow, winding roads and trails; planes dove across
ridges directly adjacent to town, painting the hills with red flame
retardant.</TE>
<TE>   Scores of Mount Baldy residents continued to defy an evacuation
order, and tensions mounted Thursday between the holdouts and
authorities.</TE>
<TE>   "If you can get out, I can get out," resident John Norris, 74,
told Wilkins outside the Mount Baldy post office, which has become a
gathering place since the fire began closing in. "If you die, I die."</TE>
<TE>   "I wish you the best," Wilkins replied. "I really do."</TE>
<TE>   One firefighter said he described to residents what could happen
to anyone caught in a forest fire. Smoke inhalation, he said, not
flames, typically brings death, and that could take can take as long
as 10 agonizing days.</TE>
<TE>   One group of holdouts included a 90-year-old woman who uses a
walker. Her relatives refused to take her down the mountain to safety
because they would not be allowed back up to defend their homes.</TE>
<TE>   Officials went door-to-door on another sweep of homes Thursday
afternoon, pleading one last time for residents to leave.</TE>
<TE>   "You can drag my smoldering carcass out of here," said Michelle
Olson, an 11-year resident of Mount Baldy, whose family owns a nearby
ski resort. "Short of that, I'm staying."</TE>
<TE>   Officials ordered the evacuation of Mount Baldy on Tuesday night,
but as many as 100 of the town's estimated 900 residents remained
Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   "We can't physically remove people from their homes," said Craig
Walker, a Twentynine Palms firefighter and chaplain. "If you really
want to stay, there is nothing we can do."</TE>
<TE>   Wilkins said even old-timers in Mount Baldy who have survived past
wildfires do not understand the implications of staying if the blaze
hits the town.</TE>
<TE>   "It will happen with an intensity and ferocity that rivals any
force of nature in the world," he said. "I don't know if these people
get it. God bless 'em. May God watch over them."</TE>
<TE>   At least six firefighters have been injured, including one who
received first-degree burns on his face, one who suffered an ankle
injury and one who was swarmed by bees. The injuries were not
life-threatening, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   The blaze began Sunday, and has been dubbed the Williams fire,
after a canyon, 25 miles north of Azusa, where it is believed to have
started.</TE>
<TE>   Investigators said they have ruled out campfires and barbecues as
a source, but said Thursday that they are still unsure how it began.</TE>
<TE>   Though the most violent flames are on the north and east flanks of
the fire, another wall of flames had been advancing slowly toward the
south, in the direction of Azusa, Glendora, San Dimas, La Verne and
Claremont.</TE>
<TE>   Officials said Thursday night that the threat to those cities was
drastically reduced by the marine layer that settled in Thursday, as
well as the work of firefighters.</TE>
<TE>   Residents have been bringing firefighters blankets and roasted
chicken. Many of the fire crews, which include volunteers, have been
sleeping outside.</TE>
<TE>   "We've never been treated better by a community," firefighter Ken
Rodriguez said near Glendora. "We'd like to come back here--but we
don't want them to have more fires."</TE>
<TE>   A gold prospector who lives at Camp Follows along the east fork of
the San Gabriel River said he was the first person to report the fire
on Sunday. Bernie McGrath, 62, said it appeared to start about 150
yards from Camp Williams.</TE>
<TE>   "I'd finished dredging in the river, and I was taking a rest at
about 3 or 4 o'clock, when I looked up and saw a big billow of
smoke," McGrath said. "I called the volunteer fire department at Camp
Follows on my radio, and then I got in my truck and drove down there.</TE>
<TE>   "There weren't any cars parked there and there weren't any
barbecues or anything like that, so I don't know how it started."</TE>

<HD>Seeking to Keep Taiwan Secure</HD>
<DH>Politics: Taiwanese Americans in the Southland contribute
$1 million to establish foundation linking the island to the U.S.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>K. CONNIE KANG</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Southern California's large Taiwanese American population has raised
$1 million to help endow a new foundation aimed at promoting Taiwan's
image in the United States.</LD>
<LD>   The money makes up the biggest share of $2.3 million raised
nationwide for the new Formosa Foundation at a series of fund-raising
events. The effort will culminate tonight with a banquet honoring the
wife of Taiwan's president. First Lady Wu Shu-chen is winding up a
10-day visit to the United States in which she became the first
Taiwanese first lady to visit Washington, D.C., in nearly half a
century.</LD>
<LD>   The United States broke off diplomatic relations with Taiwan in
1979 when it established relations with the People's Republic of
China. The Chinese government considers Taiwan a renegade province.</LD>
<TE>   Taiwan went through half a century of authoritarian rule under the
Kuomintang, or Nationalist Party, which fled to Taiwan in 1949 after
being defeated elsewhere in China by the communists. The island had
its first democratically elected president in 1996. Four years later,
Wu's husband, Chen Shui-bian, an opposition party candidate with a
large following here, won the presidency.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles banker Li-Pei Wu, who uses the honorary title of
"senior advisor to the president of Taiwan," is the founding head of
the nonprofit foundation. Wu, chairman of General Bank, based in Los
Angeles, gave $500,000 of his own money to the foundation and pledged
another $500,000 before the end of the year.</TE>
<TE>   Wu has spent half of his 68 years in the United States, but his
homeland still tugs at his heart, he said. "On one hand, I appreciate
being a U.S. citizen," he said, "but on the other hand, I have a
sentimental love for Taiwan."</TE>
<TE>   It's an emotion shared by many Taiwanese Americans. The Los
Angeles area--and the San Gabriel Valley in particular--is home to
the nation's largest concentration of people of Taiwanese heritage.</TE>
<TE>   For many years, Wu, like many fellow immigrants, devoted money and
time to the effort to topple the Nationalist government. Now that
democracy has been established on the island, Wu says he wants to do
what he can to ensure that Taiwan remains free.</TE>
<TE>   That the Formosa Foundation could raise $2.3 million at five
dinners within a week is evidence of the widespread support for the
idea in the Taiwanese American community, Monterey Park attorney
Wendell K. Hu said.</TE>
<TE>   "The future of Taiwan is a life-and-death issue with us," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The visit by First Lady Wu is designed to thank supporters of her
husband and to encourage Taiwanese Americans to be a bridge between
America and Taiwan, said Michael Lin, a spokesman for the Taipei
Economic and Cultural Office in Los Angeles. The office functions as
the equivalent of Taiwan's consulate here.</TE>
<TE>   The Formosa Foundation aims to foster good relations between the
U.S. and Taiwan, which are critical for the island's future, Li-Pei
Wu said. "Everything has to start from the U.S. because America is
the champion of freedom in the world."</TE>
<TE>   The foundation will sponsor international conferences and other
public forums to present research and facilitate discussion,
officials said. It will also underwrite fellowships and internships
in government and the news media to encourage second-generation
Taiwanese Americans to assume leadership roles in the U.S.</TE>
<TE>   Wu said his hope is to see the United States eventually accept the
idea of Taiwan as an independent country. Since the Nixon
administration, U.S. foreign policy has been to not dispute China's
claim that there is only one China and Taiwan is part of it.</TE>
<TE>   Wu admits some have told him that a fully independent Taiwan is a
"mission impossible," but he and other Formosa Foundation supporters
say they will persist.</TE>
<TE>   "I will spend the rest of my life for the cause of Taiwan," said
May Sing, a major fund-raiser in the San Francisco Bay Area. "Don't
tell the Taiwanese to be Chinese."</TE>
<TE>   During Taiwan's 2000 presidential campaign, Sing, an opera singer
married to a physician from Fremont, Calif., helped raise $625,000 in
one evening in San Francisco for Chen's candidacy.</TE>
<TE>   Not all foundation supporters are immigrants or die-hard
proponents of an independent Taiwan.</TE>
<TE>   Don Lee, a second-generation Taiwanese American attorney in Los
Angeles, said he believes the foundation can play an important role
in the Taiwan-China debate by putting all the policy options out in
the open for public discussion.</TE>
<TE>   "Whether or not Taiwan is by law an independent nation, recognized
in the international community, is an interesting issue. But to me,
at least for the time being, I would like to see Taiwan continue to
be a vibrant democracy and continue to have economic success," he
said.</TE>

<HD>Thousands Salute Fallen Deputy</HD>
<DH>Funeral: Sheriff's sergeant killed in the line of duty is
recalled as religious, fun-loving.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>An Orange County sheriff's deputy who died following an on-duty
traffic accident was remembered Thursday as a proud husband and
father with a playful sense of humor and boundless compassion.</LD>
<LD>   It was fitting, Orange County Sheriff Michael S. Carona told those
who gathered for the patrolman's funeral, that one hour after Sgt.
Matthew Davis died, his wife, Tammy, asked to meet the 17-year-old
high school girl who had struck her husband's motorcycle. The two
prayed together.</LD>
<LD>   "I don't know what they said," Carona said, fighting tears. "But
that was how they were."</LD>
<TE>   About 3,000 people, including representatives of law enforcement
agencies from around the state, attended the 2  1/2-hour funeral
service at Saddleback Church in Lake Forest. Davis, a father of three
and a 16-year veteran, died Sunday, two days after the accident.</TE>
<TE>   Following the service, a motorcade--large enough to snarl traffic
on the Riverside Freeway--traveled to Crestlawn Memorial Park in
Riverside, where Davis was buried. He had spent nearly his entire
life in nearby Corona.</TE>
<TE>   Davis, 38, was on motorcycle patrol in Mission Viejo when he was
struck by the girl's car.</TE>
<TE>   Despite their grief, family, friends and co-workers took time to
laugh.</TE>
<TE>   Don Miskulin said he met Davis 25 years ago when his new friend
moved to Corona. He recalled Davis' varied attempts to fit in. "He
was a punker, a skater, a surfer, and if you can believe it, even a
preppy."</TE>
<TE>   He said the two of them would deliver newspapers in the early
hours and then meet--every morning--at a doughnut shop for apple
fritters and coffee. They pulled pranks on teachers, traveled to
Mexico to surf and climbed Mt. Whitney.</TE>
<TE>   "Everyone has a best friend, but best friends can change. They
come and go," said Miskulin, now a Riverside County sheriff's deputy.
"But Matt was the one in a lifetime. He was forever."</TE>
<TE>   Davis loved tinkering, friends said. He took apart a clock radio
to see how it worked and once bought an old Volkswagen sedan and
rebuilt the engine, only to have it break down three times in the
next 18 months. And he bought a boat from the side of the road and
then bragged about what a good deal he got, only to find it needed
constant repairs.</TE>
<TE>   Davis, friends said, was a deeply religious man who volunteered at
his church and attended services each Sunday morning, sitting in the
front row with a Bible in one hand and taking notes with the other.</TE>
<TE>   At work, Davis, who supervised 31 motorcycle deputies in southern
Orange County, always made time for others, said Sgt. Steve Doan, a
co-worker. Even cranky callers felt inclined to thank him for his
sunny attitude, Doan said.</TE>
<TE>   "He expected the best from his troops and even more from himself,
and he always delivered," Carona said.</TE>
<TE>   Five large monitors showed pictures of a smiling Davis hugging his
children--John, 13, Jessica, 11, and Julianna, 7--his wedding
picture, hiking with friends along the John Muir Wilderness Trail and
on his patrol motorcycle.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know why God took Matt," Miskulin said. "We weren't ready
to give him up."</TE>

<HD>New Studies Sought on Ahmanson</HD>
<DH>Development: The attorney general threatens to block the
mini-city. But a company spokesman says building will start next
year.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DARYL KELLEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Atty. Gen. Bill Lockyer has weighed in against the controversial
Ahmanson Ranch housing project at the western edge of the San
Fernando Valley, calling for a full new environmental study,
threatening to block the development unless he is certain it abides
by state law and supporting the sale of the ranch to a public agency.</LD>
<LD>   Lockyer, whose office has intervened to halt projects for
environmental reasons statewide, said in an interview that old
Ahmanson Ranch studies are so dated that new ones are needed to judge
the effects of the 3,050-home mini-city on roads, wildlife and the
surrounding natural environment.</LD>
<LD>   Another broad study could take years and further delay the
$2-billion project approved by Ventura County in 1992, but stalled by
legal challenges and environmental issues. A supplemental study on
survival of a rare frog and flower is underway, but Lockyer said it
does not go far enough.</LD>
<TE>   "There's been considerable growth in the area since the previous
studies were conducted," Lockyer said. "I think it's essential that
we do an updated analysis of traffic and land use." If Lockyer is not
satisfied that the new limited study meets legal requirements, "we're
prepared to join litigation" to stop the project.</TE>
<TE>   Lockyer, whose office represents three state agencies studying the
Ahmanson Ranch plan, said that instead of construction, he favors
preservation of the 2,800-acre ranch of grazing land and oak savannas
through purchase by a public agency such as the state's Santa Monica
Mountains Conservancy.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a wonderful spot for preserving open space and for
recreation and its trails system," he said. "So it would be nice if
we could add to the conservancy most, if not all, of this property."</TE>
<TE>   Tim McGarry, a spokesman for Ahmanson Ranch owner Washington
Mutual Bank, said it's unfortunate that Lockyer took his stand before
he had read the updated supplemental report released this week by a
Ventura County consultant.</TE>
<TE>   The consultant found that a new traffic study was not necessary
and that the project could go forward without substantial
environmental harm if developers do more to protect a threatened
red-legged frog and an endangered spineflower discovered at the ranch
in 1999.</TE>
<TE>   McGarry said builders still plan to break ground on Ahmanson Ranch
next year once Ventura County approves the supplemental study.</TE>
<TE>   "We think it will become evident to the attorney general's people,
once they review the document, that Ahmanson Ranch is in full
compliance with the [law]," McGarry said. "The supplemental report
... rigorously analyzes all changed circumstances and all new
information.</TE>
<TE>   "California's political leadership," he added, "needs to take the
state housing crisis seriously."</TE>
<TE>   Lockyer first stated his views on Ahmanson in a questionnaire sent
by project opponents to local and statewide candidates in the
November election. Lockyer is running for reelection against state
Sen. Dick Ackerman (R-Irvine). Ackerman said in an interview Thursday
that he was not familiar with the Ahmanson project and hadn't taken a
position.</TE>
<TE>   Poised on a parched plateau and the sides of a canyon, the
proposed Ahmanson project includes not only thousands of homes, but
schools, parks, a town center, two golf courses and a resort hotel.
It lies just across the Ventura County line from Woodland Hills and
Calabasas, and is intended to feed workers into the huge Warner
Center office complex a few miles away.</TE>
<TE>   Most Los Angeles politicians and many Valley residents oppose it.
Los Angeles County critics say they would suffer the project's
negative effects--crowded roads, polluted air and water--while
Ventura County would receive its tax benefits. Developers argue that
the project is a model of modern "smart-growth" planning that puts
jobs and homes close together while addressing a regional housing
shortage.</TE>
<TE>   Lockyer's statements reflect an increasingly vocal opposition to
the project. In the last year, actor-director Rob Reiner has led a
potent new alliance of politicians, environmentalists and Hollywood
celebrities determined to kill it.</TE>
<TE>   Last month, Assemblyman Keith Richman (R-Northridge), a principal
supporter, withdrew his endorsement after concluding that traffic
projections included in a 1992 study are no longer reliable. Richman
said the study underestimated traffic growth on key roads--such as
the Ventura Freeway and Victory Boulevard--by up to 38%.</TE>
<TE>   Lockyer also cited traffic as a chief concern and called for a new
study, which alone could take more than a year.</TE>
<TE>   "Traffic has been one of the most significant issues, and it's a
substantial factor that has changed over the last decade," Lockyer
said.</TE>
<TE>   McGarry said nearly all of the freeway traffic growth was
anticipated, and that Ahmanson trips would be only a small part of
the increasing congestion.</TE>
<TE>   Ahmanson's projected 37,500 vehicle trips on all Valley freeways
and roads would be about half of the 72,000 daily trips created by 84
new projects built along a nearby stretch of the Ventura Freeway in
the last decade, McGarry said.</TE>
<TE>   The difference between 1992 traffic projections for six segments
of the freeway closest to the project and the actual California
Department of Transportation counts in 2000 ranges between 2.6% and
8% more traffic, the Ventura County Transportation Department found
this year.</TE>
<TE>   "Caltrans, the state agency with expertise on matters of traffic,
has concluded that the 1992 traffic projections remain reasonably
accurate and that a new traffic study is not necessary," McGarry
said.</TE>
<TE>   Lockyer's role in the Ahmanson Ranch debate is complex.</TE>
<TE>   On one hand, his office represents three agencies that have
commented critically on the project--the state departments of fish
and game, water quality control and the mountains conservancy.
Another division in Lockyer's office sues on behalf of the public to
stop projects that violate state law and submits legal analyses in
lawsuits filed by others.</TE>
<TE>   For example, Lockyer's office criticized the giant Newhall Ranch
project near Santa Clarita, and a judge halted the development until
backers could prove they had a reliable water supply in drought
years.</TE>
<TE>   Lockyer said he would decide whether to intervene after the
supplemental report is voted on by a Ventura County staff committee,
the county Planning Commission and the Board of Supervisors over the
next several months.</TE>
<TE>   McGarry said Washington Mutual's lawyers are confident the project
would survive any legal challenge.</TE>
<TE>   "The courts have repeatedly sustained the Ahmanson Ranch project
over the last 10 years," he said, "and we have every reason to
believe the [supplemental] report will be sustained."</TE>

<HD>Patrons at Real-Life Barbershop Have No Problem With Movie</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Steve Lopez</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>All I did was ask Lawrence Tolliver what the reaction was at his
barbershop on Florence near Western Avenue.</LD>
<LD>   "Wait a minute," Mr. Tolliver responded, holding the phone out.</LD>
<LD>   On the count of 3, everyone in the shop cursed the Rev. Jesse
Jackson.</LD>
<TE>   For those who missed the news, Jackson and the Rev. Al Sharpton
demanded an apology from MGM for irreverent references to the Rev.
Martin Luther King Jr. and other black leaders in the hit movie
"Barbershop."</TE>
<TE>   Must be slow times in the rabble-rousing business.</TE>
<TE>   When I arrived at Mr. Tolliver's clip joint, Allen Humphries, a
retired police sergeant, was the first to speak.</TE>
<TE>   "There's nothing in here that can't be talked about," he said,
explaining the essence of barbershop culture.</TE>
<TE>   "That's right. Ain't nothing sacred," echoed Mr. Tolliver, whose
shop walls have black-and-white photos of him meeting Rosa Parks and
Nelson Mandela.</TE>
<TE>   "There's some things we don't say in front of white folks," Tony
Wafford, an AIDS prevention counselor, said for qualification. "We
just give [you] a free pass."</TE>
<TE>   He might have been referring to a scene in the movie in which a
black barber, who plays the shop agitator, says there are three
things black people are going to have to fess up to:</TE>
<TE>   1. Rodney King deserved a beating for driving drunk, and for being
in a Hyundai.</TE>
<TE>   2. O.J. did it.</TE>
<TE>   3. Rosa Parks didn't do anything but sit down on a bus.</TE>
<TE>   In the movie, the barbershop erupts in condemnation, even though
the agitator's point about Rosa Parks is that lots of black people
went to jail for standing up to injustice, and no one knows their
names.</TE>
<TE>   One insulted customer asks what Jesse Jackson would say about such
heresy, but the agitator gives no ground.</TE>
<TE>   "[Blank] Jesse Jackson," he says.</TE>
<TE>   No wonder Jackson's in a lather. Besides, the agitator calls
Martin Luther King Jr. a womanizer, and it wasn't that long ago that
Jackson was hanging his head over the revelation that he has a love
child.</TE>
<TE>   "Black people are not monolithic in the way we think," Humphries
said.</TE>
<TE>   If Jackson doesn't know about the back-and-forth at a neighborhood
barbershop, Mr. Tolliver said, there might be a good reason.</TE>
<TE>   Mr. Tolliver, a natty, bearded gent who's been perfecting his art
for 40 years, said Jackson's entourage summoned him on two occasions
while visiting Los Angeles, asking that he please hurry over and
perform "my tonsorial services."</TE>
<TE>   At the Roosevelt Hotel in Hollywood, Mr. Tolliver cut hair for
Jackson's staff. The second time, he cleaned up Jackson himself at
the downtown Biltmore.</TE>
<TE>   "Can he come to the barbershop? No," Mr. Tolliver sassed. "He's
too busy."</TE>
<TE>   He said he had to wait 90 minutes before he cut Jackson's hair in
some fancy room called the "Music Suite."</TE>
<TE>   "If he'd been in this barbershop, he would have known what goes
on."</TE>
<TE>   "Al Sharpton ain't been in no barbershop neither," Wafford said,
suggesting that Sharpton must be getting his cool-whip "do" at a
salon. "Brother's got all that [stuff] on his head that's been out of
style since 'Superfly.' "</TE>
<TE>   What bothers Kendric Rollins, an attorney, is that there's finally
a movie in which black people aren't shooting each other and selling
drugs every day of their lives, and it gets attacked by so-called
black leaders.</TE>
<TE>   "We do get shot," he said, "but not every day."</TE>
<TE>   "Barbershop" was made by black producers, Rollins said, it's got a
black cast, it's a box-office sensation for its portrayal of a black
social institution, and Jackson's got a problem?</TE>
<TE>   "My question is, who named Jesse Jackson as my leader?" Wafford
asked. "Because I didn't get no ballot."</TE>
<TE>   "There are greater causes we need to shine a light on," Mr.
Tolliver agreed. "We got a president who wants to go to war, and 30%
of the soldiers are black people."</TE>
<TE>   "It ain't his kids goin'," Wafford echoed. "They're out smokin'
weed and drinkin' liquor."</TE>
<TE>   "This is the same Jesse Jackson who went to the Academy Awards and
complained there's not enough black people behind and in front of the
camera," Humphries said, worrying that studios will take a pass on
future black movies so they don't get blindsided by Jackson and
Sharpton, who have threatened boycotts.</TE>
<TE>   Kevin Hooks, an entertainment marketing executive, said that won't
happen. "The studios see only one thing," he said, and everyone
responded in unison:</TE>
<TE>   "MONEY!"</TE>
<TE>   Speaking of which, I offered to do my part by taking the whole
barbershop to the movie.</TE>
<TE>   "Let's go," Mr. Tolliver said after shaping his last customer's
head. He hadn't seen "Barbershop" yet.</TE>
<TE>   Tony Wafford said we should go to the Bridge, where he saw it the
first time, so we'd be able to hear the movie.</TE>
<TE>   "Black people like to give feedback," he said. "You ain't going to
hear nothing at the Magic Johnson Theatres."</TE>
<TE>   We went there anyway. I sat next to Mr. Tolliver, who wasn't
bothered by the so-called controversial scenes, but he wasn't ready
to nominate the movie for an Oscar, either.</TE>
<TE>   The real thing is hard to top.</TE>

<HD>MTA Revives Subway Proposal</HD>
<DH>Transit: Agency seeks extension down Wilshire, saying past
safety issues are no longer a problem.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KURT STREETER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Sixteen years after Congress stopped a similar plan, a proposal to
extend Los Angeles' subway down Wilshire Boulevard to the Fairfax
district and the county art museum was resurrected Thursday by the
Metropolitan Transportation Authority.</LD>
<LD>   MTA planners have long wanted to lengthen the current Red Line
Wilshire subway spur, which stops abruptly at Western Avenue, about
three miles from Fairfax Avenue.</LD>
<LD>   The Wilshire corridor is one of the densest in the nation, making
it perhaps the best location in all of Los Angeles for a longer
subway, proponents of the rail say.</LD>
<TE>   But in 1986, at the urging of Rep. Henry Waxman, who represents
the Westside, Congress prohibited the use of all-important federal
funds for tunneling in the Fairfax district. Waxman was concerned
about safety after a 1985 methane gas explosion and a fire at Ross
Dress for Less in Fairfax raised doubts about constructing a rail
line through underground oil fields.</TE>
<TE>   The congressional move forced the MTA to reroute the Wilshire
train up Vermont Avenue, through Hollywood and into the San Fernando
Valley. Another alternative, to take the railway into the Mid-City
area, also was dropped because of safety concerns.</TE>
<TE>   MTA board member and county Supervisor Yvonne Brathwaite Burke
sponsored Thursday's motion, which the board adopted by a 7-4 vote.</TE>
<TE>   Burke's motion has two facets. First, it instructs the agency to
seek the removal of the Waxman prohibition, an extremely difficult
proposition given his staunch opposition in the past. Second, it puts
a Wilshire extension to the Los Angeles County Museum of Art on a
list of projects the MTA will ask Congress to fund next year, when it
considers a multiyear transit funding package for the nation.</TE>
<TE>   The extension would not be among the MTA's short list of
high-priority projects, but would be lumped in a group that includes
completion of the final portion of a planned light railway connecting
downtown with Santa Monica, now slated to stop near Culver City.</TE>
<TE>   Burke, echoing what supporters of extending the Wilshire line have
said for years, argued that new technology would make building and
operating the line safe now.</TE>
<TE>   "The technology to take care of gas problems has changed, and we
believe that we can address the concerns that have been posed in the
past about going down Wilshire," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Burke acknowledged, however, that the proposal would need
significant support from Waxman.</TE>
<TE>   Waxman said through a spokesman Thursday that he was surprised by
the MTA's move.</TE>
<TE>   "It's difficult to believe that this is a serious effort, given
that nobody has ever mentioned anything to us about it," said Phil
Schiliro, the congressman's spokesman.</TE>
<TE>   Schiliro did say that Waxman would be willing to reconsider the
issue if new technology could minimize the risk.</TE>
<TE>   Another important part of the political equation is MTA board
member and county Supervisor Zev Yaroslavsky. The Wilshire extension
would end in his district.</TE>
<TE>   Concerned about subway and rail construction costs that ran as
high as $300 million per mile, Yaroslavsky in 1998 sponsored
legislation preventing local sales tax revenue from being used on
subway projects.</TE>
<TE>   Yaroslavsky backed Burke's motion Thursday, saying continuing a
Wilshire line is among the most important traffic-busting projects
the MTA could undertake. But he said he has no intention of trying to
repeal his legislation.</TE>
<TE>   "You are not going to get local money to do it," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Without local money, the MTA would be forced to ask Sacramento to
split costs with the federal government on what probably would be one
of the agency's most expensive projects.</TE>
<TE>   Strongly opposing the motion was MTA board member and county
Supervisor Mike Antonovich, who called the plan a waste of money.</TE>
<TE>   "This opens up a Pandora's box to the subway construction lobby,"
said Antonovich, who wants the MTA to concentrate on construction of
cheaper light rail lines. "The board wants to build a gold-plated
system at the expense of taxpayers."</TE>

<HD>After Big Court Case, She's Affirmative and Active</HD>
<DH>A student with a high-profile past joins UCLA law school's
race studies program.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BOB POOL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As a witness in one of the country's most important trials involving
racial politics, Erika Dowdell raised her hand and swore she would
never attend a law school without an affirmative action enrollment
policy.</LD>
<LD>   The college junior's emotional commentary about racism and
segregation was considered some of the most powerful testimony in the
2001 court case.</LD>
<LD>   The case eventually led to a federal appeals court ruling that
race may be used as a criterion for admission to the University of
Michigan law school.</LD>
<TE>   So what is Dowdell doing taking classes at the UCLA law
school--where affirmative action admission policies have been banned
for the last five years?</TE>
<TE>   She has been lured there by a new Critical Race Studies curriculum
designed by UCLA law professors to counter the impact of Proposition
209, the 1996 statewide ballot measure that bars racial and gender
considerations in state hiring, contracting and public university
admissions.</TE>
<TE>   UCLA describes itself as the first U.S. law school to offer such a
systematic study of the role of race in law, public policy and civil
rights. Designed as a kind of major within the law degree program, it
offers courses such as "Street Law" and "Asian American
Jurisprudence" to second- and third-year law students.</TE>
<TE>   "That's what attracted me," said the 21-year-old Dowdell. "In the
trial, I had testified very vehemently that I would not go a
university that did not have an affirmative action program. But I was
so attracted to the Critical Race program that I had to rethink that.
It's ironic that I'm here."</TE>
<TE>   Actually, Dowdell never intended to enrolled in any law school
when she testified in Detroit federal court as a student "intervener"
in the University of Michigan law school suit.</TE>
<TE>   The case was brought on behalf of Barbara Grutter, a mother of two
who charged that she had been denied admission to the law school
because minority students were given preferential treatment. Although
a lower court agreed with Grutter that the law school's affirmative
action policy violated the U.S. Constitution by discriminating
against white applicants, the Cincinnati-based U.S. 6th Circuit Court
of Appeals reversed the ruling on a 5-4 vote.</TE>
<TE>   "I had planned on being a K-through-12 teacher," said Dowdell, who
was a history major at the University of Michigan when she testified
in March 2001. "I got involved in the case when I was 17 and in high
school, and a group of students from the university came and made a
presentation about the upcoming trial.</TE>
<TE>   "They said that, without affirmative action, institutions of
higher education would be resegregated. My parents were from
Birmingham, Ala., so that really struck a chord in my heart."</TE>
<TE>   When she took the stand in Detroit federal court, Dowdell told of
having been raised with three other children by her mother and
attending inner-city schools that sometimes lacked books or class
supplies.</TE>
<TE>   "I put a lot of my own personal emotions in it. I'd invested a lot
in the case. So when we [initially] lost, that's what really made me
decide that I was going to law school," she said.</TE>
<TE>   "I felt a deep betrayal by the law, more so because the judge who
ruled in the case kind of admitted there are racial problems in this
society and there is no level playing field, that segregation still
exists. He kind of said there's nothing the court can do about that.
And I disagreed with that."</TE>
<TE>   She applied to law schools at the University of Michigan, Howard
University and UCLA.</TE>
<TE>   "I'd decided I would only go to a place I could continue to be
active," she said of her decision to enroll at UCLA, which came as
the appeals court was considering the Michigan case. Its ruling in
favor of affirmative action came May 14.</TE>
<TE>   "I was excited by the decision, but there was still some tension
there for me," she said.</TE>
<TE>   "A victory confirmed our arguments, but at the same time I think a
lot of people will take that to mean they can get comfortable."</TE>
<TE>   Dowdell expects the ruling to be appealed to the U.S. Supreme
Court. She said she is prepared to go to Washington to demonstrate in
favor of affirmative action.</TE>
<TE>   "I believe in being an activist by whatever means is necessary to
get your point across. You sometimes need to demonstrate as well as
negotiate," she said.</TE>
<TE>   "I saw myself coming to California and extending the debate,
knowing there is a lot of discussion about affirmative action here
because of Proposition 209. I figured if I come here and tell my
Michigan experience, it can influence more people to start talking
about how to reverse 209."</TE>
<TE>   UCLA law officials say they welcome that kind of talk. Dowdell is
one of 13 blacks in this year's class of 300 first-year students. In
comparison, the 1996 class, which enrolled before Proposition 209 was
passed, included 19 African Americans.</TE>
<TE>   "The faculty generally was and remains against Proposition 209,"
said law school Dean Jonathan Varat. "I certainly would like it to be
reversed. But we're a law school and we obey the law."</TE>
<TE>   Varat said protests against Proposition 209, such as last year's
four-hour occupation of Royce Hall and a takeover of the law school
admissions office that led to the arrest of a dozen law students in
2000, "are inevitable." But he said he hopes students direct their
protests toward voters and lawmakers, not faculty members.</TE>
<TE>   Law professor Laura Gomez, who teaches "Comparative Racialization
&amp; the American Legal System" in the Critical Race Studies program,
said affirmative action is necessary for California universities to
reflect the state's diversity.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of black students don't want to come where they feel
unwelcome," she said. "Do you want to join a club where they don't
want you as a member?"</TE>
<TE>   Gomez agrees that the University of Michigan lawsuit will
eventually be considered by the U.S. Supreme Court. In the meantime,
the trial itself will be fodder for classroom debates at law schools
everywhere.</TE>
<TE>   Dowdell said she's ready for that.</TE>
<TE>   "I'll think, 'Oh, they're discussing me!' I can add my opinion and
explain firsthand what I saw and experienced and what I know about
the case," she said.</TE>

<HD>Jury Must Decide if Lies Point to Murder</HD>

<LD>I'd pay good money to be in the room when jurors begin deliberating
the fate of murder suspect Hugh "Randy" McDonald, who wrapped up
testimony in his own defense Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   Because it's a murder trial, it is by definition about the
passions and motives that drive someone to the edge and beyond. And
the McDonald jurors will have to decide a tantalizing question: Did
McDonald flee Orange County in 1997 because he had just shot and
killed a Villa Park woman in her home or, as he says, because he
wanted out of a loveless marriage and failed life?</LD>
<LD>   McDonald, 53, spent parts of three days on the witness stand this
week, virtually unwavering in tone or action while trying to convince
jurors that his departure and faked suicide had nothing to do with
Janie Pang's murder. What drove him out of his life in Corona del
Mar, he testified, was a personal and business life that had
unraveled. When he headed for the Golden Gate Bridge, he planned to
end it all--until he changed his mind and decided to embark on a new
identity instead.</LD>
<TE>   McDonald said repeatedly that he dropped out of the life he had
known to escape the emptiness and pain. In the kind of irony that
murder trials produce, deputy Dist. Atty. Walt Schwarm forced
McDonald to relive almost every element of that life.</TE>
<TE>   Schwarm was as biting and skeptical as the law allows while
grilling McDonald, but hasn't been able to put him at the home of
Janie Pang--the wife of a client of McDonald's former law firm. Nor
are officials even sure if McDonald and Pang ever met before she
died.</TE>
<TE>   Minus any physical evidence or known motive linking McDonald to
Pang's death, Schwarm set out to make McDonald look as unlikable as
possible. And with McDonald's help--he copped to all kinds of
unseemly and criminal behavior--Schwarm no doubt made inroads.</TE>
<TE>   Among other things, McDonald conceded that he engaged in money
laundering before he left Orange County, and theft and forgery after
he left.</TE>
<TE>   "You've got the ability to look someone in the eye ... size them
up, lie and then get what you want?" Schwarm asked.</TE>
<TE>   McDonald said he wouldn't put it quite that way but acknowledged
on various occasions that he had lied and deceived people after he
left California in an effort to keep his secret life intact.</TE>
<TE>   McDonald insisted that his 26-year marriage had grown "loveless"
and that debts and fear that his shady business practices would be
exposed compelled him to disappear. McDonald wasn't found--and
arrested--until August 2001, more than four years after Pang's
murder.</TE>
<TE>   "Are you on trial for identity theft?" Michael Molfetta,
McDonald's attorney, asked his client after Schwarm was through. "Are
you on trial for deceiving your family? Are you the first guy ever to
lie to a girl you're trying to ingratiate yourself [with]?"</TE>
<TE>   The jury of seven men and five women is decidedly skewed to middle
age and, therefore, possessed of lots of life experience. That's why
I'd love to hear them discuss whether they think the cad on the stand
was also a killer.</TE>
<TE>   Will they believe that a man can drop out of society because he's
fed up with his life? Or will they conclude that, however unclear
McDonald's link to the Pang family, the coincidence of him leaving
the area is just too much to swallow?</TE>
<TE>   Toward the end of McDonald's testimony, Molfetta executed a
perfect ploy that, despite drawing Schwarm's objection and Judge
Frank Fasel's angry admonishment to cut the comedy, couldn't have
been lost on the jury:</TE>
<TE>   "Did you ever read the story of Pinocchio to your kids?" Molfetta
asked McDonald.</TE>
<TE>   "Yes," McDonald replied.</TE>
<TE>   "An infamous liar, wouldn't you agree?" Molfetta said.</TE>
<TE>   Before McDonald could muster much of a reply, Molfetta asked: "How
many people did he kill?"</TE>

<HD>2 Ex-Priests Charged in Molestations</HD>
<DH>Court: Michael Baker does not enter a plea to 29 counts;
Carlos Rodriguez pleads not guilty to eight. A third ex-cleric is
still at large.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD WINTON, ANNA GORMAN and MEGAN GARVEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Stating that no profession is beyond the law, prosecutors charged two
former Roman Catholic priests Thursday with multiple counts of
molesting children in parishes where they served.</LD>
<LD>   The charges marked the first tangible results of a nine-month
investigation of Roman Catholic clerical sexual misconduct in Los
Angeles. Another priest--an elderly retiree reportedly on an overseas
cruise--is being sought by authorities.</LD>
<LD>   "Today's filings are part of the continuing effort to hold
accountable those priests who have abused their positions of trust
and victimized others," Los Angeles County Dist. Atty. Steve Cooley
said in a statement.</LD>
<TE>   "No profession or occupation is immune from civil authority and
the operation of the criminal justice system," Cooley said.</TE>
<TE>   If convicted, the former priests charged Thursday could be
sentenced to lengthy prison time. Michael Stephen Baker, 54, faces up
to 26 years in prison and Carlos Rene Rodriguez, 46, a maximum of 22
years if convicted on all counts.</TE>
<TE>   "I am beyond excited," said a 34-year-old West Hollywood man who
alleged in a lawsuit filed earlier this year that he is one of
Baker's victims. "The day of judgment has finally come for him. I and
other victims will get our day in court."</TE>
<TE>   Investigators said the cases are the first of more than a dozen
planned prosecutions of priests and former priests alleged to have
sexually molested children during their tenures in local parishes.</TE>
<TE>   Law enforcement officials said Thursday that the investigations
are continuing.</TE>
<TE>   "We hope our arrest of any child abuse suspect will help other
victims to have the comfort level to come forward," said Los Angeles
Police Capt. Sharyn Buck, who said two more alleged victims had
contacted police Thursday. "There are possible victims out there who
have watched this from afar, and they are seeing these arrests and
can see we're doing something."</TE>
<TE>   In an austere courtroom in Downey, Baker--who is being held on
$1-million bail--stood handcuffed in jail clothes and gave one- or
two-word answers to questions posed by court officials.</TE>
<TE>   He appeared slightly overweight, with graying hair and a mustache.
In 1986, Baker admitted to Cardinal Roger M. Mahony that he had
molested boys. After his admission, Baker was sent for treatment and
later transferred to nine different parishes.</TE>
<TE>   He left the priesthood in 2000, shortly after he and the Los
Angeles Archdiocese paid $1.3 million to settle a lawsuit brought by
two Mexican brothers who alleged that the priest had molested them
over 15 years, ending in 1999.</TE>
<TE>   Baker did not enter a plea Thursday to the 29 counts filed against
him for abuse of a boy between 1976 and 1985. He was charged with 13
counts of committing a lewd act upon a child, and 16 counts of oral
copulation. Prosecutors alleged that the abuse began when the victim
was 9.</TE>
<TE>   "This is the best case we have right now, but we very much
anticipate more victims will come forward as they read and hear about
these charges," said district attorney's office spokeswoman Jane
Robison.</TE>
<TE>   Baker's attorney, Donald Steier, asked Los Angeles County Superior
Court Commissioner Ross Klein to postpone that arraignment until Oct.
17. He said he will legally challenge the sufficiency of the charges,
which he called "creative writing." Steier also argued that the
$1-million bail was unreasonable.</TE>
<TE>   "The defendant is a lifelong resident of the area. There is
only one victim here," Steier said. He said the number of counts
against his client had grown from 13 listed in the arrest warrant
Wednesday to 29 Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   The man whom prosecutors allege Baker molested said Thursday that
the charges have been a "long time coming."</TE>
<TE>   The man said he was abused repeatedly by Baker at St. Paul of the
Cross Church in La Mirada, according to a lawsuit he and several
others filed earlier this year.</TE>
<TE>   He said prosecutors have asked that he not discuss specific
events. Previously he told The Times that Baker would arrange to have
him spend the night at the St. Paul rectory and that the abuse
started off "very subtly" and then progressed.</TE>
<TE>   Rodriguez, who resigned from the priesthood in 1993, was arraigned
Thursday afternoon in a courtroom in downtown Los Angeles on eight
counts of committing lewd acts upon a child under the age of 14.</TE>
<TE>   Handcuffed and standing behind a glass wall, Rodriguez pleaded not
guilty.</TE>
<TE>   Deputy Dist. Atty. Hilleri Merritt wrote in the complaint that
there is independent evidence--another witness--that "clearly and
convincingly corroborates the victim's allegations" that he was
sexually molested by Rodriguez.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles County Superior Court Commissioner Jeffrey M. Harkavy
set a preliminary hearing for Oct. 8. He set bail at $400,000.</TE>
<TE>   Merritt said there are three additional potential victims, two who
allegedly were abused in Santa Barbara and a third in Arizona. The
third victim witnessed the alleged crimes in Los Angeles and will be
called to testify at the preliminary hearing, she said.</TE>
<TE>   Merritt said the alleged abuse against the victim in that case
occurred at "various places within the county of Los Angeles" but not
at St. Vincent de Paul Church on West Adams, where Rodriguez was
assigned at the time.</TE>
<TE>   Deputy Public Defender David Rice, who represented Rodriguez at
the arraignment, declined to comment about the charges, saying only,
"The plea speaks for itself."</TE>
<TE>   A third priest accused of child sexual abuse, who left a week ago
on a monthlong cruise, was still being sought. Law enforcement
officials said they are working out a plan to arrest retired priest
G. Neville Rucker, 82.</TE>
<TE>   Officials said they know his itinerary and are assessing their
options on how to apprehend Rucker, who is wanted on a felony arrest
warrant. LAPD officers contacted Steier, who also represents Rucker,
Wednesday morning and asked that Rucker turn himself in at police
headquarters by noon. Steier informed them that his client was out of
the country.</TE>
<TE>   "He's traveling across the top of the world," said one law
enforcement official, who added that Rucker's next port of call is
believed to be in Russia.</TE>
<TE>   Steier, who as of Thursday had not spoken to Rucker, said his
client was "on vacation, he's not a fugitive."</TE>
<TE>   Arthur Goldberg, an attorney who represents four people who have
sued Rucker, said he can't believe the former priest was allowed to
go on a cruise.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it's utterly disgusting," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Steier contended again Thursday that law enforcement officials had
mishandled the arrests of Rucker and Baker, who he said would have
surrendered voluntarily if given prior notice.</TE>
<TE>   Baker was apprehended at a La Mirada residence about eight hours
after sheriff's deputies first tried to take him into custody at his
downtown Long Beach apartment. Steier said he was on his way to
surrender at the time.</TE>
<TE>   The prosecutions raise the possibility that church officials,
including Mahony, may be called to testify.</TE>
<TE>   Although there is a 10-year limit on prosecution of most types of
molestation, no time limit applies for the most serious sex crimes
against children 15 and younger.</TE>
<TE>   Such instances, involving crimes such as rape and oral copulation,
require clear and convincing contemporary corroborating evidence,
such as admissions to another person, diaries or letters.</TE>
<TE>   Attorney J. Michael Hennigan said Thursday that as the prosecution
proceeds, the Los Angeles Archdiocese will continue to be
"cooperative in any way possible with law enforcement."</TE>
<TE>   Hennigan said church officials would be willing to testify without
being subpoenaed, but he did not anticipate that they would be called
to court.</TE>
<TE>   "As far as we are aware, there is no useful information that would
help either the prosecutors or the priests," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Hennigan said it was unlikely that any of the former priests would
be of any help to the ongoing criminal prosecution.</TE>
<TE>   "I can't imagine that any one of these priests would be useful to
any other's case," he said. "I imagine that all of these activities
were done in the strictest of secrecy."</TE>

<HD>Lopez Recall Effort Qualifies for Ballot</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DANIEL YI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Backers of a recall campaign against Santa Ana school board member
Nativo V. Lopez have enough petition signatures to force a special
election early next year, the county registrar of voters confirmed
Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   The development marks another milestone in the political battle
over the direction of the Santa Ana Unified School District, which
has riveted the city in recent months.</LD>
<LD>   Recall supporters accuse the second-term board member of promoting
bilingual education in the heavily Latino, 62,000-student district in
defiance of Proposition 227, the 1998 voter-approved ballot measure
that severely curtailed bilingual instruction in California
classrooms.</LD>
<TE>   Lopez has steadfastly denied any wrongdoing. He maintains that the
recall is motivated by a handful of disgruntled parents and backed by
interest groups, including north Santa Ana residents angry over the
board's approval last year of a new elementary school near their
homes.</TE>
<TE>   According to the registrar of voters, officials counted 9,685
valid recall signatures during an examination of 14,161. Recall
organizers needed 8,624 valid signatures of district voters to
qualify for an election.</TE>
<TE>   They submitted petitions bearing 14,826 signatures Sept. 12. But
the count was halted once it was clear there were more than enough
valid signatures, county election officials said. The registrar
nullified 4,476 names of people who were not registered district
voters.</TE>
<TE>   If the recall goes to a ballot, it will mark the first such vote
in Santa Ana in at least 20 years. A 1990 effort to recall two City
Council members failed for lack of signatures.</TE>
<TE>   Barring any court action, the school district must call an
election for early next year.</TE>
<TE>   Lopez vowed he and his supporters will halt the recall. "It is
absolutely not over," he said. "And we are going to challenge the
fraudulent nature in which they obtained the signatures."</TE>
<TE>   During a school board meeting Tuesday, Lopez supporters demanded
the district investigate allegations that recall supporters used
professional signature gatherers in an unlawful way. Some weren't
registered voters in the district, which Lopez and others say is
illegal.</TE>
<TE>   District officials said Thursday they forwarded the allegations to
several state and local agencies.</TE>
<TE>   Tim Whitacre, a campaign strategist for Families for Education
First, the group that sponsored the recall, said the group did hire
professional signature gatherers, which is legal.</TE>
<TE>   Some of the signature gatherers were registered voters from other
districts, Whitacre said, but they were legally supervised by Santa
Ana registered voters.</TE>
<TE>   "It is not a small task that we have accomplished," he said. The
registrar's certification of the signatures, he added, "further
validates we stood by the law. We went out and we did it despite the
odds."</TE>

<HD>Richman Calls for Film Permit Control</HD>
<DH>Breakup: The mayoral candidate says a Valley city should
take over the task for its area from agency being probed for alleged
misuse of funds.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PATRICK McGREEVY and NITA LELYVELD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>San Fernando Valley mayoral candidate Keith Richman on Thursday said
a Valley city should take over film permitting in its area from the
Entertainment Industry Development Corp., which is under criminal
investigation for alleged misuse of funds.</LD>
<LD>   "There are too many questions concerning the EIDC," said Richman,
one of 10 Valley mayoral candidates in the Nov. 5 secession election.
"I will [make] sure that all permit fees stay in the new Valley
city."</LD>
<LD>   The EIDC, a quasi-public agency that handles film permits for the
city and other local jurisdictions, has become an issue in the
secession campaign because it contributed $25,000 to Mayor James K.
Hahn's anti-breakup effort. Hahn, who had solicited the donation,
returned the money after questions were raised on whether the EIDC
can legally make political contributions, since some believe the
permit fees it collects are public funds.</LD>
<TE>   The district attorney's office is examining a range of EIDC
spending practices, including campaign contributions.</TE>
<TE>   "There clearly is confusion about whether EIDC is a public
agency," Richman said. "There should be no question issuing film
permits is a public function."</TE>
<TE>   Richman took on the film agency the day after the secession drive
lost its political consultants because the campaign has not paid its
bills. He said the firm's departure was not a setback, and could be a
plus.</TE>
<TE>   "It can be very positive," Richman said, "in that the Valley
independence campaign can focus its resources on voter contacts
rather than paying consultant fees."</TE>
<TE>   The candidate also confirmed that one of his own political
consultants, Dan Schnur, has left the campaign. Richman insisted his
mayoral bid was financially sound, however, having raised about
$100,000.</TE>
<TE>   The San Francisco-based Schnur described his split with Richman
early this month as amicable and said he considers the lawmaker the
front-runner in the mayor's race. But he also said the other
prominent candidate, Mel Wilson, might be competing with Richman for
the same fund-raising dollars.</TE>
<TE>   "My impression is that after Wilson's entry into the race, Keith's
fund-raising wasn't what he anticipated," Schnur said. "So the luxury
of having an advisor on the payroll as opposed to a full-time staff
in the field didn't make much sense."</TE>
<TE>   In Hollywood, meanwhile, secessionists took pains Thursday to
separate themselves from the Valley campaign's money troubles.</TE>
<TE>   Hollywood secession leader Gene La Pietra said the campaign there
has bought about $100,000 in radio advertising for the two weeks
before the election.</TE>
<TE>   Campaign officials said they have paid for 160 minute-long radio
spots, and will buy more if necessary to respond to anti-secession
ads.</TE>
<TE>   The Hollywood Independence Committee also has hired former Los
Angeles City Councilman Robert Farrell to build secession support in
South Los Angeles, where Hahn's campaign plans to open an office
Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   "We're in great shape," said La Pietra, a millionaire nightclub
owner who has spent more than $1.4 million to bankroll the secession
campaign. "We're definitely where we should be at this point in
time."</TE>

<HD>GOP Champion Has Run Some Party Interference</HD>
<DH>Politics: State leader Shawn Steel speaks his mind, even
when Bush team advises against it.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MICHAEL FINNEGAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Shawn Steel threw himself into politics on the streets of the San
Fernando Valley in 1964 by ripping down Lyndon Johnson posters at
construction sites. In the Youth for Goldwater brigades, it was known
as "sniping."</LD>
<LD>   "You peel off their stuff and trash it, and you put up your stuff.
I loved it," Steel recalled. "I learned to be confrontational pretty
early."</LD>
<LD>   Decades later, Steel, now the state Republican Party chairman,
still has a knack for confrontation, even when others--important
others--would like him to back off.</LD>
<TE>   The others include White House advisors who thought Steel went a
step too far in May when he wrote an article saying that President
Bush's system for naming judges in California was "half-baked."</TE>
<TE>   So Bush confidant Marc Racicot, chairman of the Republican
National Committee, bounced Steel from the RNC executive committee,
which did nothing to stop Steel's public challenge of the Bush
forces.</TE>
<TE>   The dust-up was only one of the reasons for Steel's schism with
his party's presidential administration and many high-ranking elected
California Republicans. In the 19 months that he has held the top
state party post, he has rankled nerves from Washington to Sacramento
to Orange County, where a state party convention starts today in
Garden Grove. In that way, he has come to symbolize the infighting
that has distracted the state party for years from its central--and
largely elusive--goal: winning elections.</TE>
<TE>   Steel, not surprisingly, will be part of the convention show as
allies seek to restore powers that were stripped from him months into
his tenure.</TE>
<TE>   To Steel's friends, his tendency to blurt out thoughts before
weighing the consequences is a large part of his gregarious charm,
but also his Achilles heel.</TE>
<TE>   "Shawn's willing to charge up the hill before he's got the battle
all mapped out," said U.S. Rep. Dana Rohrabacher (R-Huntington
Beach).</TE>
<TE>   Others have more critical assessments of the Rolling Hills lawyer,
who also teaches ethics at a school for chiropractors.</TE>
<TE>   "He's the crazy uncle we want to hide in the basement," said a top
state Republican whose opinion of Steel is shared by several others.</TE>
<TE>   Steel lost powers in a state party overhaul engineered by Bush
allies. Control of the party's money was yanked from the state
chairman and entrusted instead to a board of directors. But Steel, a
GOP activist for more than three decades, has jealously guarded his
key remaining function: the power to speak out.</TE>
<TE>   The biggest and most damaging of Steel's feuds is the one with
President Bush's top political man in California, Gerald L. Parsky,
who led the party overhaul. Although Steel has campaigned hard for
Bush, gubernatorial nominee Bill Simon Jr. and other Republicans, he
and his loyalists have refused to drop their anti-Parsky crusade.</TE>
<TE>   "His tactics vis-a-vis [Parsky] have been at times inappropriate
and not helpful to the party," said state GOP Treasurer Douglas Boyd,
a friend of Steel.</TE>
<TE>   Many GOP leaders view the dispute as an ego-driven power struggle,
but Steel says he is fighting to safeguard Republican influence over
the federal courts.</TE>
<TE>   He blames Parsky for setting up judicial screening committees that
give Democratic senators Barbara Boxer and Dianne Feinstein a say in
Bush's nominees to the bench. Steel calls Boxer and Feinstein "mortal
enemies" of Republicans.</TE>
<TE>   "Gerry Parsky is well-meaning, naive, inexperienced, and not
politically sophisticated," Steel said during a San Francisco meeting
of the RNC in July.</TE>
<TE>   Parsky, a Rancho Santa Fe investment mogul, responded: "I'm only
doing what the president of the United States has asked me to do in
California, including chairing the statewide judicial review
committee."</TE>
<TE>   White House spokesman Ken Lisaius said the administration stands
by the judicial screening system, and Bush's political team has
locked arms with Parsky.</TE>
<TE>   "Gerry is our friend, our colleague, and part of the family that
is focused on doing everything we can to win this campaign for Bill
Simon," said Jack Oliver, deputy chairman of the RNC.</TE>
<TE>   At the convention this weekend, the intraparty feuding threatens
to shatter the image of unity that Republicans hope to project as
they pay tribute to Simon.</TE>
<TE>   Steel allies have called for a vote on restoring his spending
power. They also have proposed a resolution calling for "termination
of the Parsky/Boxer/Feinstein judicial committees as a failed
experiment." After squawking from the Simon campaign, Steel agreed to
try to postpone the votes until after the Nov. 5 election, but other
Republicans may still press forward.</TE>
<TE>   Apart from the Parsky feud, Steel has also clashed with the state
top Republicans: Sen. Jim Brulte of Rancho Cucamonga and Assemblyman
Dave Cox of Fair Oaks. Cox bridled at Steel's suggestion that GOP
lawmakers return a $50,000 contribution from Enron.</TE>
<TE>   "Mr. Steel can return any money he wants to--that's his," Cox
said.</TE>
<TE>   Cox also "exploded" last week when Steel was quoted in the New
York Times lamenting a leadership vacuum in the California GOP,
according to a Republican leader. Cox and Brulte were in New York
raising money at the time, and potential donors asked them about
Steel's comments, the Republican said. Brulte called Steel to
complain.</TE>
<TE>   Steel said he meant to bemoan the dearth of Republican elected
officials, not the quality of party leaders.</TE>
<TE>   Steel's outspokenness has even caused consternation at home, where
he and his wife, Michelle Eun Joo Park Steel, live with two
daughters, 12 and 15, and his wife's mother.</TE>
<TE>   "I always tell him, you have to think things over before you speak
out," his wife said.</TE>
<TE>   Steel, 56, was raised in Sherman Oaks by his mother and her
succession of four husbands. His father, the first, was a heavy
drinker and gambler who abandoned the family when Steel was a baby.</TE>
<TE>   Politics, Steel said, "rescued kind of an aimless drift of a life"
soon after he started at Van Nuys High School. After the Goldwater
campaign, he volunteered for Ronald Reagan's 1966 race for governor.</TE>
<TE>   He used his networking skills (he calls himself "very much a
people person") to climb quickly to the state chairman's post at
Young Americans for Freedom, a conservative group formed to counter
the student antiwar movement.</TE>
<TE>   Steel was drawn to the Republican Party mainly by the fight
against communism, but also by a firm belief in limited government.
His staunch libertarian views have kept him in good standing with the
conservatives who would later elect him state party chairman. A
longtime member of the National Rifle Assn., he owns two pistols and
a shotgun. "I'm a big 2nd Amendment guy," he said.</TE>
<TE>   But on other touchstone issues, his views are less popular with
the right, so he plays them down. He said he backs job benefits for
gay domestic partners. And although he opposes late-term abortions
and supports parental consent for minors seeking abortions, Steel
also said government generally should not block women from getting
abortions.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think I have a right to deny it to anybody," he said.
"I'm very wary of governmental involvement in people's lives."</TE>
<TE>   Still, conservatives have been the backbone of Steel's support
within the party. He was treasurer and vice chairman before winning
the top job.</TE>
<TE>   As Steel rose through the party ranks, he also built an
independent law practice. He set up shop in mid-Wilshire in 1978,
just as thousands of immigrants were transforming part of the area
into Koreatown.</TE>
<TE>   "He was very astute in going into the community and meeting
chiropractors and doctors and auto-body repairmen, and being, I
guess, a politician," recalled Jim Stroud, a lawyer who worked with
Steel.</TE>
<TE>   Steel handled car accident, medical malpractice and immigration
cases. A Steel specialty was legal work for chiropractors and
acupuncturists. He teaches an ethics class at Cleveland Chiropractic
College in Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   At a lecture Monday morning, he worked the classroom aisles in the
style of Phil Donahue as he reviewed an essay called "The Trouble
with Trial Lawyers."</TE>
<TE>   "There's a patient or two out there who might see you as nothing
but a money tree," he warned students.</TE>
<TE>   But in the final weeks of election season, Steel devotes most of
his time to politics.</TE>
<TE>   As party leader, he has tried to broaden outreach to minority
voters and recruit a broad range of moderate and conservative
candidates, said GOP consultant Allan Hoffenblum.</TE>
<TE>   But the "ego battle between him and Parsky" has been deeply
divisive for the party, Hoffenblum said.</TE>
<TE>   Rohrabacher, though, said Steel "was never given a chance to fail
or succeed in the exercise of the authority that he rightfully won"
before Parsky led the overhaul of the party.</TE>
<TE>   For now, Steel has vowed to lie low and try to help fellow Simon
supporters avert squabbles at the convention.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not going to take on Mr. Parsky or say anything hostile about
him at all," Steel said. "Until the election is over."</TE>

<HD>O.C. Residents Worry About PCB Readings</HD>
<DH>Safety: State examiners find the cancer-causing compound at
homes near Bolsa Chica, causing concern about health, property
values.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SEEMA MEHTA and DAVE McKIBBEN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>State toxic-substance examiners, in tests that were expanded last
week, have discovered a cancer-causing compound in the lawns of homes
near the Bolsa Chica wetlands, unnerving homeowners who worry about
their exposure to the chemicals as well as their tanking property
values.</LD>
<LD>   "I would leave in a heartbeat, but I can't," said Chris Daly, who
two years ago bought a $580,000 home next to a Bankton Drive house
where moderate levels of PCBs were discovered in the lawn. "Can you
imagine what this has done to the [house's] value?"</LD>
<LD>   Daly's neighbor, Mary Ann Cross, has lived in her home for more
than two decades, and worries that the contamination investigators
found at her home--and on the adjacent land where her three grown
children played when they were little--might affect her family's
health.</LD>
<TE>   "I've done all this gardening for 25 years, and to think I've been
bringing [contaminated] dirt in this house that long," said Cross,
whose property was retested last week.</TE>
<TE>   The state Department of Toxic Substances Control found dangerously
high levels of PCBs, or polychlorinated biphenyls, earlier this year
on two acres of an undeveloped 42-acre plot next to the residential
neighborhood where Cross and Daly have homes.</TE>
<TE>   After determining that the levels at the 2-acre site were as much
as 3,220 times the federal safety standard, the department mailed
notices to 7,500 residents. The area had been fenced previously,
after preliminary tests revealed PCB contamination.</TE>
<TE>   In July, the agency tested the lawns at five homes near the site,
and found PCBs in the soil at two, both on Bankton Drive in
Huntington Beach. Some samples showed moderate to high contamination
at the two homes.</TE>
<TE>   Additional tests were conducted at those homes last week, but the
findings are not expected for some time.</TE>
<TE>   Thomas M. Cota, chief of the state agency's Southern California
cleanup operations, said, "We've met with the property owners and
subsequently done some additional sampling to characterize the nature
of the contamination. That will be used to develop a cleanup plan."</TE>
<TE>   Daly said he and some of the other residents plan to pursue legal
action if the state's cleanup plan doesn't satisfy their concerns. No
one has tested his land yet, and no one warned him of the dangers
when he bought his home.</TE>
<TE>   "Apparently it has been common knowledge for a long time, but no
one told us a thing about it," he said. "Our kids were playing right
in that area until they put that fence up."</TE>
<TE>   Until being banned nationwide in the 1970s, PCBs were used as
industrial lubricants and coolants in large electric transformers.
The man-made compound has been shown to cause cancer in animals and
is classified a "probable carcinogen" for humans. It can affect the
immune, reproductive, neurological and endocrine systems.</TE>
<TE>   It's unclear how the PCBs got into the soil of the homes or on the
adjoining 42-acre plot, known as the Fieldstone property, or how long
ago. Regulators speculate that it may have been illegally dumped at
the site.</TE>
<TE>   Hearthside Homes, developer of the Bolsa Chica mesa, bought the
Fieldstone property for $1.2 million in late 1999, and planned to
sell it to the state for the same amount so it could be added to the
wetlands restoration project that is underway. Now, it is unclear
when that sale will happen.</TE>
<TE>   The developer has entered into a consent order with the state that
dictates monitoring and cleanup, which could start in 2003.</TE>
<TE>   The cleanup will probably involve hauling the contaminated soil to
a hazardous waste landfill.</TE>
<TE>   "Certainly we are on the hook," said Lucy Dunn, Hearthside's
executive vice president. "We don't know ultimately who might
contribute to this or who's responsible for [the contamination]."</TE>

<DH>If history is a guide, domestic issues will trump Iraq in
midterm elections.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROSS K. BAKER</AU>
<BD>Ross K. Baker is a political science professor at
Rutgers University.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The midterm elections of 1962 were held just a few weeks after the
fateful 13 days of the Cuban missile crisis. Contemporary accounts
pronounced President Kennedy's handling of this brush with nuclear
war to have been masterful.</LD>
<LD>   The "eyeball-to-eyeball" confrontation between Kennedy and Nikita
Khrushchev resulted in the removal of Soviet missiles from Cuba.</LD>
<LD>   Political logic might dictate that scores of Democratic
congressional candidates would romp to victory. Yet Kennedy's party
lost four seats in the House and picked up three in the Senate.</LD>
<TE>   It was a wash.</TE>
<TE>   And that's probably what Republicans can expect from the current
showdown with Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   To be sure, some GOP congressional candidates have tagged their
Democratic opponents as nervous Nellies who have gone wobbly at the
prospect of going to war to disarm Saddam Hussein. This was the cause
of Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle's indignant response to
President Bush on the floor of the Senate on Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   But if all Republicans have to offer the voters is a more
truculent line toward Iraq, and they present no other compelling
reason to choose them, they will end up the losers.</TE>
<TE>   Few midterm elections have yielded dramatic setbacks to the party
of the president, and when they do, the causes usually have little to
do with war and peace.</TE>
<TE>   The Democratic loss of Congress in 1946 had more to do with the
problems of reconversion to a civilian economy after World War II
than it did with the war itself, or even with the emerging Cold War.</TE>
<TE>   The 1958 election, in which President Eisenhower's Republicans
took a 48-seat hit in the House and suffered the loss of 13 senators,
was due almost exclusively to the economy.</TE>
<TE>   The falloff of 47 Democratic House seats in the 1966 election had
more to do with the large number of Democrats elected on Lyndon
Johnson's coattails in 1964 in districts that were solidly
Republican.</TE>
<TE>   The 1974 election was all about Watergate and the pardoning of
former President Nixon by his successor, and the GOP loss of 26 House
seats in 1982 was the product of a national unemployment rate that
had soared to more than 10% under President Reagan.</TE>
<TE>   Even the spectacular blowout of Democrats in 1994 by the
Republicans led by then-Rep. Newt Gingrich of Georgia was a
repudiation of President Clinton's domestic policies.</TE>
<TE>   Of those midterm elections conducted in wartime, the impact of the
hostilities is unclear.</TE>
<TE>   The 1950 election, conducted five months after the start of the
Korean War, saw President Truman's Democrats losing 29 seats in the
House and six in the Senate, a fairly substantial loss.</TE>
<TE>   But in the 1970 election in the midst of the Vietnam War, Nixon's
GOP House contingent was reduced by only 12 members, and he picked up
two seats in the Senate.</TE>
<TE>   What drives congressional elections are three factors that are
remarkably durable.</TE>
<TE>   The first is the partisanship of the voters. With so many House
seats sewn up by one party or the other because of gerrymandering,
the opportunity for many seats to change hands is limited.</TE>
<TE>   The second factor is the quality of the candidates, often defined
as how much money a candidate can raise.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, there are the issues.</TE>
<TE>   It is here where we would expect anxieties over Iraq to have their
greatest impact, but most candidates will be able to position
themselves to take advantage of the pulse of the public in their
states and districts.</TE>
<TE>   For example, a group of 18 liberal Democrats held a rally in
Washington last week to deplore not war itself but rather the
president's haste to go to war. Their caution reflects the hesitancy
of their constituents, and they are not likely to suffer for it.</TE>
<TE>   Two decades ago, House Speaker Tip O'Neill laid down the axiom
that all politics is local. The issues closest to home--the economy
and jobs, health insurance and prescriptions for the elderly--will
influence more voters than the stand any one member of Congress takes
on regime change in Iraq.</TE>

<HD>Leave Our Pensions Alone</HD>
<DH>Social Security privatization proposals have proved
dubious.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBERT M. BALL</AU>
<BD>Robert M. Ball was commissioner of Social Security
under presidents Kennedy, Johnson and Nixon and served the Clinton
administration in various advisory capacities. His latest book is
"Insuring the Essentials: Bob Ball on Social Security" (Century
Foundation, 2000).</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Older working people thinking about retirement can be thankful that
President Bush's plan to substitute private savings accounts for part
of Social Security isn't already in effect. The stock market's
gyrations would create enormous problems for anyone trying to retire
and convert a private investment account into an annuity.</LD>
<LD>   This summer, Brookings Institution economist Gary Burtless studied
how workers retiring would have fared if a Bush-type plan had been in
existence. He found that a savings account built up over 40 years and
invested 100% in stocks could have been converted into an annuity
equal to somewhat more than recent average earnings--if it had been
applied for at age 62 on Jan. 1, 2000. But the annuity would be less
than half as much if applied for at age 62 on Jan. 1, 2003, assuming
the same stock market averages on that date as the actual averages on
July 19, 2002.</LD>
<LD>   Facing this situation, anyone contemplating retirement would have
to make an agonizing decision: Retire now, hoping to protect against
further loss, or hold off in hopes of a higher stock market later.
Guessing wrong would have serious consequences.</LD>
<TE>   The suddenly conspicuous vulnerability of Bush's plan to market
downturns helps explain why so many previously supportive Republican
candidates are backpedaling, and why the president is working so hard
to persuade retirees and older workers that their benefits are safe
regardless of how younger workers might fare.</TE>
<TE>   Whether he succeeds may determine whether Democrats or Republicans
control the next Congress.</TE>
<TE>   Older Americans vote in greater numbers than any other age group,
and concerns about Social Security can easily determine how they'll
vote. (The poorest two-fifths of those over 65 get 82% of their
income from Social Security; the middle fifth, 64%; and the next
highest fifth, 46%. Even the top fifth will be significantly
dependent on Social Security when large numbers of them retire.)</TE>
<TE>   But can older voters count on keeping the full benefits provided
by current law if the president's plan is enacted? The honest answer
is no.</TE>
<TE>   To begin with, the commission charged with implementing the
president's goals was given conflicting instructions: Protect the
benefits of the retired and the soon-to-retire and bring Social
Security into long-range balance while diverting billions of dollars
in program funding into private accounts.</TE>
<TE>   The president made the task harder by ruling out two obvious
options: raising Social Security taxes and directly investing program
funds in stocks (to secure, over the long run, better returns than
are attainable from investing in government bonds).</TE>
<TE>   The panel produced three proposals, one of which doesn't even
claim to bring Social Security into long-range balance and so can be
ignored. The others bring Social Security into balance by cutting
benefits.</TE>
<TE>   One plan cuts benefits more than enough for balance; the other
achieves balance by combining benefit cuts with funding from general
revenues. Both establish individual savings accounts using major
additional infusions of general revenue.</TE>
<TE>   Even with such infusions, however, under either plan many workers
now younger than 55 would end up with less in total retirement
income--Social Security plus income from their savings accounts--than
under the current Social Security program alone. The situation would
be worse for those whose investments do less well than average.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the dependence of both plans on huge infusions of
general revenues has been undermined by the Bush tax cuts, which, if
allowed to go fully into effect, will mean there won't be any
surpluses. In that case, any general revenues spent on Social
Security would add to the overall deficit.</TE>
<TE>   Would Congress support what appears to be a dubious deal? No one
can predict. But remember, many supporters of privatization have
proposed cutting benefits of the elderly and near-elderly by such
strategies as reducing the annual cost-of-living adjustment and
raising the retirement age. Such proposals could be brought forth
again.</TE>
<TE>   It appears that the only entities assured of doing well under
partial privatization are financial services firms.</TE>
<TE>   The moral is clear: Older workers and retirees should be deeply
skeptical about promises that their benefits are protected. Such
pledges are sure to become negotiable in the real world of lawmaking.</TE>
<TE>   The only safe course for voters is to insist on preserving Social
Security for the benefit of all workers--past, present and future.</TE>

<BD>Bruce Felton is the author of "One of a Kind: A
Compendium of Unique People, Places, and Things" (William Morrow &amp;
Co., 1992).</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Midmorning on a warm, late-summer day: I'd just finished jogging in
Central Park and was standing at the corner of Amsterdam Avenue and
90th Street in Manhattan, dripping with sweat, waiting for the light
to change. A 30ish woman with a small boy in tow stopped and said,
"Could I ask you an enormous favor?"</LD>
<LD>   Holding out a business envelope, she asked if I would be passing a
mailbox.</LD>
<LD>   She was neatly dressed, friendly, vaguely attractive.</LD>
<TE>   And I'm an obliging sort of guy.</TE>
<TE>   "There's a mailbox on my corner," I said, accepting the envelope
with a smile. "It'll be no problem."</TE>
<TE>   She thanked me warmly and we went our separate ways.</TE>
<TE>   Truth to tell, I am not at my sharpest right after a run. It's
only after I've showered and dressed that my head clears and my
synapses resume firing at normal speed.</TE>
<TE>   So it didn't occur to me until I was halfway across the avenue
that the woman's request didn't add up.</TE>
<TE>   Would I be passing a mailbox? This is Manhattan; how could I avoid
passing a mailbox? They're everywhere, as common as Starbucks.</TE>
<TE>   Chances are the woman would have passed a mailbox herself in a
block or two. But for some reason, she felt the wiser option was to
entrust her envelope to a stranger. How could she be sure I wouldn't
cram it in my back pocket and forget about it, or toss it in the
nearest trash can?</TE>
<TE>   By the time I made the far curb, the hard facts in this blurred
picture swam into focus: It was the anniversary of Sept. 11 and a
woman I didn't know had inexplicably asked me to mail a letter.</TE>
<TE>   Was I being played for a dupe?</TE>
<TE>   Neither the handwriting on the envelope nor the address--the human
resources department of a company in midtown--yielded a clue to the
puzzle.</TE>
<TE>   Had this transaction occurred prior to last year's anthrax scare,
it wouldn't have merited a second thought. But, as we are reminded
endlessly by the media, by the long check-in lines at airports and by
our lingering anxieties about anthrax and other mail-borne pathogens,
we live in a changed world.</TE>
<TE>   Should I have demurred at the woman's request? I asked myself as I
inspected the envelope for traces of white powder. Hell, no. Changed
world or not, it is our willingness to smile back at strangers,
perform small kindnesses and keep our paranoia in check that make
life bearable, especially in this city. I wouldn't have balked at
rendering an easy courtesy like this a year ago. I sure wasn't going
to change my ways now. Otherwise--I felt a cliche coming on--the
terrorists win.</TE>
<TE>   Predictably, when I related the story to my wife and friends,
there was a fair amount of smirking at my naivete: "Come on. Why
would she hand you the letter when she could mail it herself?" Good
question. "Maybe she looked at my face and decided she could trust
me--same way I sized her up," I said.</TE>
<TE>   A friend who designs research projects speculated that I might
have been an unwitting participant in a psychological study.</TE>
<TE>   "The idea could be to see how people respond under varying
circumstances," he suggested. "Would a test subject be less willing
to mail the letter if the woman isn't accompanied by a child? What if
she's plain-looking or overweight? What if the person asking the
favor is a man? What about a man wearing a turban?"</TE>
<TE>   Tough questions. And, in all honesty, I can't say with any
certainty how I would have handled the situation with different
variables. The woman on Amsterdam Avenue was Caucasian. Would I have
been as receptive to a neatly dressed Semitic-looking man? I like to
think I would; does that suggest I'm in denial? On the other hand,
perhaps I would have begged off politely and directed him to the
nearest mailbox. "There's one up the street, same direction you're
walking." Does that stamp me as a racist?</TE>
<TE>   I can't say. What I do know is that my liberal biases, which I've
carried with me since grade school, no longer offer the comfort of
easy answers. "Would you have turned her down?" I asked my friends.
Even the most cynical admitted that they probably would have helped.
"There you go," I said.</TE>
<TE>   I walked to the corner and released the envelope into the box. But
before I did, I looked it over one last time. Nothing. Then I wiped
it on my shorts to purge it of my fingerprints. I felt pleased at
having done a favor for a stranger.</TE>
<TE>   But there's no sense taking chances.</TE>

<HD>Bush Must Realize the Nuclear Option Is No Option at All</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAMES E. GOODBY</AU>
<BD>Ambassador (Ret.) James E. Goodby was chief negotiator
for the cooperative threat reduction program during the Clinton
administration.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>For decades, U.S. presidents have been spared the agonizing decision
of whether nuclear weapons should be used in battle. But war in Iraq
could force the issue to the president's desk.</LD>
<LD>   For several years, Washington's policy has been to hint that
nuclear weapons might be used against anyone who unleashed biological
or chemical weapons against the U.S., its troops or its allies.</LD>
<LD>   It has been called a policy of calculated ambiguity, and it is
believed to have been part of the reason that Saddam Hussein did not
use chemical or biological weapons during the Gulf War.</LD>
<TE>   The policy of calculated ambiguity may work during a
U.N.-sanctioned invasion of Iraq. There are probably plenty of senior
Iraqi military officers who would also understand the consequences
for them personally if they authorized or took part in any use of a
weapon of mass destruction.</TE>
<TE>   But a cornered tyrant and his desperate henchmen could believe
that they have nothing to lose.</TE>
<TE>   Deterrence could fail.</TE>
<TE>   Then President Bush would face a fateful decision. Should he set
an example for the future by using nuclear weapons in retaliation for
an enemy's use of biological weapons? Should he respond with nuclear
weapons to bring the Iraqi war to a rapid conclusion, as happened in
Japan in 1945? Would an eye for an eye be seen as the right response,
by public opinion, no matter what the strategic consequences might
be?</TE>
<TE>   We know little of the administration's thinking on this issue, not
surprisingly, given a policy of calculated ambiguity.</TE>
<TE>   We can assume that Bush would share his predecessors' reluctance
to open a door that has been closed since two American atomic bombs
leveled Hiroshima and Nagasaki. But if Hussein unleashes biological
weapons, the landscape of warfare will have dramatically changed.</TE>
<TE>   According to the memoirs of former Secretary of State James A.
Baker III, there were two levels of deterrence working against
Hussein during the Gulf War: first, a threat to remove the Iraqi
leader from power, and second, a vague threat to use nuclear weapons.</TE>
<TE>   Today, Hussein's removal would be a war aim rather than a threat.</TE>
<TE>   The impression that the United States would retaliate with nuclear
weapons could continue to deter--up until the time Hussein no longer
cared what happened to him or his nation.</TE>
<TE>   Clearly, the U.S. would want to eliminate Hussein's biological and
chemical weapons and his nascent nuclear weapons program at the very
outset of a war. Airstrikes could substantially degrade any
biological and chemical capabilities that Iraq may possess.</TE>
<TE>   Whether preemptive strikes could completely destroy them is
problematic, if Iraqi mobility and concealment of chemical and
biological facilities are as effective as some defense experts claim.</TE>
<TE>   Given that doubt, one would think that the president would want to
engage in a maximum effort right now to find and destroy Iraqi
weapons of mass destruction. This would require the use of U.N.
inspectors backed up by national intelligence with unfettered right
of timely access.</TE>
<TE>   Yet if the goal of "regime change" is given equal priority, as the
administration seems to wish, Hussein would doubtless interpret
United Nations disarmament efforts as a first step designed to weaken
him. If discussion of a regime change were deferred, the chances of
eliminating Iraq's weapons of mass destruction by peaceful means
might improve somewhat.</TE>
<TE>   Strongly supported by British Prime Minister Tony Blair, the
administration portrays Hussein as the master of a serious biological
and chemical weapons capability. If that is so, then enormous harm
could come to U.S. and allied troops and to thousands of innocent
civilians, even with a seriously degraded Iraqi biological weapons
capability, if deterrence or preemptive attacks fail in any respect.</TE>
<TE>   The first President Bush was inclined against eye-for-an-eye
retaliation for reasons that still apply today. U.S. dominance in
other advanced weaponry makes recourse to nuclear weapons unnecessary
to defeat Hussein, according to all reports.</TE>
<TE>   And, because it would encourage the spread of nuclear weapons and
lower the barriers to nuclear conflict, nuclear retaliation by the
U.S. would be a self-defeating policy. It would open the door for
nuclear war in regional conflicts elsewhere and could spark a global
nuclear arms race.</TE>
<TE>   That would be the deadliest of the many terrible legacies Hussein
could leave to the world.</TE>
<TE>   Even if he will not tell us, Bush should decide against the use of
nuclear weapons.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>This year's end-of-session flood of new state laws, more than 1,000
of them if Gov. Gray Davis signs them all, will certainly not dim
California's reputation as the nation's legislative pioneer. It also
sustains the state's reputation as a place where too much gets done
in last-minute horse-trading with too little consideration.</LD>
<LD>   The end-of-session bills included nationally significant and
controversial issues from paying for workers on family leave to
encouraging embryonic stem cell research, both of which Davis signed.</LD>
<LD>   Earlier, the Legislature passed and Davis signed the country's
first measure that attempts to slow global warming by reducing carbon
dioxide emissions from autos.</LD>
<TE>   In all three of these signature cases, Sacramento is moving
counter to Washington. One reason is that Democrats hold big margins
in the Senate and Assembly and have the governor's office, although
Davis is more conservative on some issues than the legislative
leadership. It came as a surprise to many that he signed the bill to
provide partial pay for workers on family leave through the state
disability system.</TE>
<TE>   The paid leave bill was strongly backed by organized labor, which
has supported Davis. But it was just as strongly opposed by business
groups. Only experience will tell whether opponents' warnings of
disastrous costs to business are Chicken Little or the real deal.</TE>
<TE>   The global warming bill passed in spite of a high-profile
multimillion-dollar campaign of doomsaying by auto makers and
dealers.</TE>
<TE>   Lawmakers sent Davis 1,236 bills in the final three weeks of the
term, giving the governor and his staff until midnight Monday to act
on them all. Through Wednesday, he had signed 864, vetoed 72 and had
300 still on his desk.</TE>
<TE>   California has long been a legislative pioneer. The state's 1970
Clean Air Act remains the nation's strongest. Its 1982 auto lemon law
became the model for the nation. This was the first state to ban
assault weapons, in 1989.</TE>
<TE>   One major disappointment this year was the failure of a bill to
limit the sale and marketing of personal financial data by banks and
insurance companies. These big campaign contributors managed to kill
the bill even though polls showed it to be immensely popular.</TE>
<TE>   A scandalous number of lawmakers allowed it to die by merely not
voting on the measure, a way to effectively cast a "no" vote while
avoiding the notoriety of being anti-consumer.</TE>
<TE>   Davis, a beneficiary of the same institutions' largess, quietly
opposed the bill unless it was softened with amendments.</TE>
<TE>   California deserves to be the first in the nation in financial
privacy. The Legislature can see that it happens early next year.</TE>
<TE>   Legislators in other states already are drafting global warming
bills. The same is likely on stem cell research and paid family
leave.</TE>
<TE>   "The states are laboratories for democracy and California is the
chief laboratory," University of Virginia political scientist Larry
Sabato said after the session. We just wish the laboratory didn't
accomplish most of its yearly work in a couple of chaotic days.</TE>

<HD>Politics Fouls War Debate</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Democrats and Republicans are accusing each other of playing politics
over going to war in Iraq. Both are right. Which is why the nasty
dispute between Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle (D-S.D.) and
President Bush about who's really interested in America's national
security epitomizes where the Iraq debate should not be headed.</LD>
<LD>   Instead of engaging in name-calling and political
advantage-seeking, the White House needs to make as persuasive a case
as it can for war--and Congress needs to scrutinize it on its merits.
Young Americans will be sent off to fight Iraq, if it comes to that.
They and their families deserve to know exactly what is intended and
how it will get done.</LD>
<LD>   With November elections looming and the economy looking sicker,
the temptation for Republicans to focus on war is natural.</LD>
<TE>   But in casually accusing the Senate on Monday night at a New
Jersey fund-raiser of being uninterested in national security,
President Bush crossed a line. Bush appears to have realized this,
declaring in the Rose Garden on Thursday that the debate "will be
conducted with all civility" and signaling compromise on a proposed
United Nations resolution.</TE>
<TE>   Civility, however, is not the real issue. A good debate is
impassioned and vigorous, even angry. The fact is that for all his
pique about Bush's comments, Daschle has failed to lead his party.
Democrats' silence in response to the administration's full-court
press for war has only made the splits among the party's potential
presidential contenders starker. Sens. Joseph I. Lieberman (D-Conn.)
and John Edwards (D-N.C.) stake out hawkish positions, while former
Vice President Al Gore is all tough-dove.</TE>
<TE>   Daschle's tactical responses to the administration have been
inept: Initially, he favored prolonged debate about the war, but now
he is pushing for a resolution in two weeks because Democrats are
desperate to get back to discussing sinking 401(k) plans. In his
rush, Daschle isn't asking the substantive questions that need to be
asked.</TE>
<TE>   They include: How convincing are the administration's
justifications for war? Suddenly, the White House is back to claiming
specific links between Al Qaeda and Iraq. National Security Advisor
Condoleezza Rice says that Saddam Hussein has sheltered Al Qaeda
terrorists and trained them in chemical weapons. She should show
Americans the evidence.</TE>
<TE>   President Bush says that Al Qaeda could become "an extension of
Saddam's madness." What, exactly, does that mean, considering that
most of the 9/11 attackers were Saudi and none was Iraqi? How would
the war on terrorism be disrupted or helped by an invasion of
Baghdad? Is the administration willing to work with the U.N. on
getting weapons inspectors into Iraq if a satisfactory Security
Council resolution is passed? What plans does the administration have
for a postwar Iraq?</TE>
<TE>   The country deserves substance on this momentous issue, not the
spin control it's been getting too much of.</TE>

<LD>It's like a tragi-comedic Italian opera--call it "Parmesan"--this
breast-thumping battle over a region's right to claim title to its
cheese, ham or other prized products.</LD>
<LD>   "Food is part of the cultural identity of a people," intones Paolo
Galloni, a ham producer in Italy's Parma region.</LD>
<LD>   Andrea Bonati, who heads a group of food producers in the region,
adds this paean to geographical pride-of-product: "It's something
that deeply affects the feelings...."</LD>
<TE>   Bravo!</TE>
<TE>   It's hard not to admire culinary craft peoples' heartfelt loyalty
to local food. Still, we feel obliged to point out that, in
translation, these arias for regional respect have become cries for
global protectionism.</TE>
<TE>   The European Union has already accepted the arguments, ruling in
June that only Parma products, such as that pungent, flavorful hard
cheese, can be sold as "Parmesan." The list of EU-protected products
has reached 600 and is rapidly growing. Now a Parma consortium wants
EU negotiators to extend such protections worldwide through the World
Trade Organization.</TE>
<TE>   Who can blame Bonati and his Parma pals for turning up their noses
at the grainy stuff that Americans shake onto spaghetti from green
cardboard cylinders labeled "Parmesan Cheese?" But taste isn't the
only issue. The United States and many other nations allow regions to
protect their names with a form of trademark. But they're reluctant
to allow regions to stake a claim on names already in wide use, such
as Parmesan.</TE>
<TE>   Defenders of regional products, however, are pushing to expand
protections of gourmet geographic names to ridiculous lengths.</TE>
<TE>   Under Italian law, Parma ham must be sliced and packaged in the
Parma region. Six months ago, a Brussels judge outraged these proud
producers by saying it's OK for British butchers to cut the ham.</TE>
<TE>   The United States and many other countries have reasonable rules
concerning these products already, and American negotiators in the
WTO should continue to resist European proposals to expand
protections.</TE>
<TE>   Italian farmers and cheese makers do the world a great epicurean
service with their exquisite products, but their overreaching is pure
bologna.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>I am enraged by the constant bashing on European countries because of
their opposition to President Bush's approach to solving the Iraqi
problem. How can he expect unconditional support on anything when it
has been Bush himself in the past 18 months creating an atmosphere of
hostility by rebuffing almost every international agreement on issues
like global warming, the International Criminal Court, etc.? How does
he expect to convince European leaders if his own defense secretary
signals that he is not interested in even meeting with his German
counterpart at the NATO conference (Sept. 25)? What sort of
relationship is he planning to have with Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder
if he doesn't even grant him the courtesy of congratulating him on
his win (editorial, Sept. 25)?</LD>
<LD>   Isn't talking things out what politicians are supposed to do? As a
European I am appalled by the way Bush treats democratically elected

<TE>   I am not an advocate of war. But there is another side to the
objections to war against Iraq. Much of the population complained
that, although we had warnings prior to Sept. 11, no one did anything
to prevent the tragedy that killed almost 3,000 and affected the
lives of so many countless others. Now we do have warnings of Iraq's
malevolent intentions toward the U.S. Should we ignore the warning
signs and do nothing again?</TE>

<TE>   Re "Gore Assails Bush's Stance on Iraq, Questions Motive for War,"
Sept. 24: I am a charter member of the "Anyone but Gore in 2004"
club. However, it has been exasperating to see the leading
congressional Democrats knuckle under to the Bush rhetoric regarding
an invasion of Iraq. Now, finally, a prominent Democrat has
criticized the Bush warmongering for the folly it is. When the U.S.
suffers the consequences for this misadventure, as it most assuredly
will, Al Gore may be the only presidential hopeful in a position to
say, "I told you so."</TE>
<TE>   I don't think that Gore has a leg to stand on when complaining
about how Bush is handling Iraq. After all, Gore and President
Clinton and Congress did nothing for years after the United Nations
inspectors were kicked out. Now it is time to stand back and see how
it should have been handled years ago.</TE>

<TE>   The subtitle to James Pinkerton's Sept. 24 commentary, "War Talk
Provides Cover Fire," says that the "focus on Iraq draws attention
from the economy." That may be true for those unaffected by the
spiraling economic downturn.</TE>
<TE>   For those millions who have seen their stock portfolios go into
the tank and the millions of unemployed, the focus is still on the
economy. Election day in November could prove that. The focus will
indeed change for all of us if the number of military casualties
reported from the impending war with Iraq are unexpectedly high.</TE>
<TE>   For now, "it's still the economy, stupid."</TE>

<LD>Thank you for reporting the nonviolent resistance of the Palestinians
in Ramallah and other West Bank towns this week ("Palestinians Raise
Nonviolent Ruckus Over Israel's Moves," Sept. 25). This dimension of
Palestinian resistance has long gone underreported, even though it
has a long history. While most Palestinians, when asked, support
violent resistance, most of the resistance has been nonviolent.</LD>
<LD>   Furthermore, pacifist groups such as the Palestinian Center for
Rapprochement Between Peoples in Beit Sahour, the Palestinian Center
for Nonviolence in Hebron and the Holy Land Trust in Bethlehem have
been tirelessly and courageously leading nonviolent, direct actions
against the occupation for years.</LD>

<LD>Re "Armey's Remarks Assailed," Sept. 25:</LD>
<LD>   House Majority Leader Dick Armey (R-Texas), speaking at an event
in Florida, was quoted by a local paper as saying: "I always see two
Jewish communities in America: one of deep intellect and one of
shallow, superficial intellect.</LD>
<LD>   "Conservatives have a deeper intellect and tend to have
occupations of the brain in fields like engineering, science and
economics," Armey said, while liberals flock to "occupations of the
heart." It would seem that Rep. Armey is the exception to the rule.</LD>

"liberals are generally not very bright, and conservatives are deep
thinkers." His asinine remark is thinking in its most shallow form.</TE>

<LD>Re "Don't Derail Yosemite Plan," editorial, Sept. 24: The losers in
the current Yosemite Valley Plan are valley campers and their
families. Camping is the only acceptable and compatible use for our
national parks. Concession and lodging services are enhancements and
are welcomed, but they are not to drive park policy, which is the
current plan mantra. Smog in Yosemite Valley is from the San Joaquin
Valley, surrounding major cities and unregulated diesel tour buses,
not campers in emissions-regulated autos. The people who oversee the
park and Rep. George P. Radanovich (R-Mariposa), who is slowly
getting the point, know that we campers love Yosemite. It is outgoing
park Supt. David Mihalic and The Times who just don't get it. Do your
homework!</LD>
<LD>   Brian H. Ouzounian</LD>

<TE>   Your editorial was right on target. As a native Californian and
Yosemite lover since the '50s, former park technician in Yosemite,
participant in the Yosemite master plan debates in the '70s and one
who was married in Yosemite, I find the actions of Radanovich (and
perhaps his staff) myopic at best and disastrous at worst. In
Mihalic, Yosemite finally had a park superintendent who had the will
and skill to move the master plan forward and, in doing so, turn
Yosemite into what a national park was intended to be.</TE>
<TE>   One of our crown jewels was becoming another Jellystone Park
through the actions of a short-sighted politician who plays local
politics. Radanovich's actions are so very sad for future generations
who may never know Yosemite and our national parks.</TE>

<TE>   Just a minute. Let's say my grandmother is in a wheelchair and her
family is willing to wait for a reserved parking spot so she can see
Yosemite. Most of it, anyway. I have tramped the Yosemite backcountry
since 1957. Grandma ain't going to Hart Lake. John Muir's Yosemite
Valley is fantasy. It's gone. But Grandma wants to see the most
beautiful place on Earth. As it still is. The most aggressive
features of the Yosemite plan have Grandma's family manhandling her
onto a bus and looking for a rack for her wheelchair.</TE>
<TE>   One more thing. No more "sport" wheels on walking paths in the
valley. Confine bicycles to the leisurely road traffic and ban
skateboards from walkways. I walked 50 miles into Yosemite, over the
10,500-foot Isberg Pass, over 40 years ago. I wasn't disappointed to
find people there. It was as beautiful and timeless then as now. I
ask The Times and its readers to advocate a plan that remembers
Grandma.</TE>

<HD>Cuba Trade Show Is a Propaganda Blitz</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Re "Cuba Trade Show Whets Appetites of U.S. Firms," Sept. 24: Would
that the Havana food and agricultural trade show were a real trade
show where customers trade freely with dealers! A country like Cuba,
where business activity is banned and the state controls everything,
cannot hold trade shows since there is nobody to trade with. It can,
on the other hand, put on a propaganda blitz, paid for by U.S.
businesses, to push the U.S. Congress into voting for export trade
credits.</LD>
<LD>   Castro is broke, foreign investment in Cuba has fallen
catastrophically in the last year and those credits would not only
benefit him, by propping up his regime, but a few big U.S.
corporations, such as Archer Daniels Midland. Congress should demand
that Castro allow a true market economy--allowing ordinary Cubans to
own individual businesses--before agreeing to lift the trade embargo.
U.S. taxpayers, in turn, should be wary of subsidizing failed
dictatorships like Castro's or of succumbing again to the renewed
wiles of corporate sirens.</LD>
<LD>   Enrico Mario Santi</LD>
<TE>   Professor of Latin American Studies,</TE>
<TE>   University of Kentucky, Lexington, Ky.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The appearance of the California Dancing Raisins at the food and
agricultural trade show in Cuba this month was cited in an amusing
aside, but that event could be more important than it at first may
seem, because it may foreshadow what is bound to occur in Cuba with
the inevitable demise of the Castro regime. Pity the average closet
Cuban democrat: No sooner will he finish reveling in the end of one
of the world's most durable authoritarian regimes than he will be
virtually flooded with a tsunami of U.S.-engineered mascots, logos
and jingles.</TE>
<TE>   Any Cuban feeling overwhelmed by this massive onslaught of
California Raisins, Ronald McDonalds and Tony the Tigers making their
way to the island should be able to turn to the nearest American
tourist for support, as there will undoubtedly be a staggering number
of mainland visitors making the brief flight or Love Boat tour from
Florida and basking in the welcoming glow of previously arrived
Starbucks, Dennys and 7-Elevens.</TE>
<TE>   Since Cuba has about as many potential consumers as the state of
Pennsylvania, major corporations have by now laid out their "Cuban
invasion" plans and need wait only for a conversion to democracy or,
more likely, a hastily slapped together Eastern European-style
free-enterprise system, to flood the island with their essentials. So
when the happy day comes, Cuba, enjoy your newfound food freedom and
purchasing power. Just be prepared for the cultural Gotterdammerung
that will inevitably accompany these.</TE>

<HD>Nils Bohlin, 82; Swede Invented Lifesaving 3-Point Car
Safety Belt</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Nils Bohlin, the inventor of the three-point seat belt, a standard
safety device in most cars that is credited with saving up to a
million lives worldwide, has died. He was 82.</LD>
<LD>   Bohlin died Saturday in Ramfall, Sweden, after suffering a heart
attack earlier last week and a stroke in May, family members said.</LD>
<LD>   The lap-and-shoulder belt invented by Bohlin was introduced by car
maker Volvo in 1959. Its use is now required by law in many
countries.</LD>
<TE>   The U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration estimates
that three-point seat belts reduce the risk of deaths in car crashes
by at least 45%.</TE>
<TE>   Born on July 17, 1920, in the central Swedish city of Haernosand,
Bohlin developed ejection seats for Swedish aircraft maker Saab
before joining Volvo as a safety engineer in 1958.</TE>
<TE>   Seat belts at the time used a single strap with a buckle over the
lap, a design that risked injury to body organs in high-speed
crashes.</TE>
<TE>   Bohlin sought to find a simple, comfortable alternative that would
protect both the upper and lower body. His three-point solution
allowed occupants to buckle up with one hand, using one strap across
the chest and another across the lap. The buckle was placed next to
the hip.</TE>
<TE>   "In a way, my design works as much because the belt is comfortable
for the user as it does because it is safer," Bohlin said earlier
this year, after learning he had been inducted into the National
Inventors Hall of Fame in the U.S.</TE>
<TE>   "The pilots I worked with in the aerospace industry were willing
to put on almost anything to keep them safe in case of a crash, but
regular people in cars don't want to be uncomfortable even for a
minute," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Bohlin was to have been honored by the National Inventors Hall of
Fame at a ceremony in Akron, Ohio, on the day of his death. His two
stepsons attended the ceremony in his place, organization spokeswoman
Rini Paiva said.</TE>
<TE>   "His seat belt is everywhere. It's become a standard," Paiva said.
"Everyone has a story about how the seat belt saved the life of
someone they know."</TE>
<TE>   A Volvo research team recently estimated that Bohlin's invention
had saved 1 million lives.</TE>
<TE>   Bohlin received numerous awards and was elected to the

<HD>Borrowing of $12.5 Billion by State Urged</HD>
<DH>Spending: Controller Kathleen Connell says the
unprecedented amount is needed to pay bills until tax revenue
improves.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CARL INGRAM</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>State Controller Kathleen Connell, warning that the "financial
integrity" of California is at stake, is calling for state government
to borrow an unprecedented $12.5 billion to overcome a cash flow
crisis.</LD>
<LD>   She said that the squeeze between income and expenditures may
persist through the rest of the fiscal year, but that the general
fund cash box must receive an immediate infusion to pay all the
state's bills for October.</LD>
<LD>   Connell asked state Treasurer Phil Angelides to issue short-term
"revenue anticipation notes," a routine form of borrowing that is
repaid when the flow of tax revenue improves. A spokeswoman said
Angelides intends to issue the notes as needed.</LD>
<TE>   Connell, a Democrat, blamed the cash shortage on a variety of
things, including the long-delayed sale of a record $11.9 billion in
energy bonds authorized by the Legislature and Gov. Gray Davis during
the electricity crisis last year.</TE>
<TE>   Angelides announced Thursday that he will confer with investors
today and disclose the timetable for the long-awaited bond sale.</TE>
<TE>   Davis' office refused Thursday to comment on Connell's demand or
her sometimes biting analysis of why the borrowing is necessary.
Instead, aides directed reporters to the state Department of Finance.</TE>
<TE>   "It's in the best interests of the state to have cash on hand to
pay for services. This is what this is about," said Anita Gore, the
department's spokeswoman. She noted that last year such borrowing
totaled $5.7 billion.</TE>
<TE>   Approximately $7 billion from the sale of the energy bonds must be
spent to repay the state's general fund, which made loans to the
state Department of Water Resources for electricity purchases last
year when California's three biggest private utilities were near
financial collapse and unable to buy their own supplies.</TE>
<TE>   Originally, the bonds were to be sold in June 2001, but a series
of disputes involving the department and the state Public Utilities
Commission--as well as litigation and technical issues--delayed the
transaction, which would be the biggest in California history.</TE>
<TE>   Connell, prevented by term limits from seeking reelection this
year, also blamed the cash squeeze on reduced tax collections because
of the state's economic "uncertainty" and the recent shortfall in
anticipated revenue.</TE>
<TE>   She said all her findings "argue for a revenue anticipation note
of $12.5 billion to ensure the financial integrity of the state."</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Tom McClintock of Thousand Oaks, the Republican nominee for
state controller, called Connell's request for the revenue
anticipation notes "an inevitable result of the most reckless budget
adopted in California's history."</TE>
<TE>   "She has no choice but to maintain funds to pay bills," said
McClintock, who, like most other Republicans voted against the
$99-billion state budget. "The fault is not the controller's. The
fault is of the governor and Legislature for adopting a budget that
is wildly out of balance."</TE>
<TE>   "The controller is doing what she ought to be doing," said Steven
Westly, the former eBay Inc. executive who is the Democratic
candidate hoping to succeed Connell. "She is being fiscally
conservative and independent. We've got to take care of the debts
that the Legislature has left us with."</TE>
<TE>   McClintock opposed the budget--and has voted against 11 of the 16
state budgets since he has been in the Legislature. Westly praised
the end of the budget standoff earlier this month, but said more cuts
are needed.</TE>
<TE>   Connell, a regular critic of Democrat Davis, said the
administration had projected revenues at $3 billion higher than her
own calculations. She also asserted that the governor's budget
experts had "substantially inflated" revenue expectations during the
first six months of 2003.</TE>
<TE>   But Gore defended the Finance Department, at one point rejecting
an assertion by Connell that an estimate of higher revenue "simply
masks" other issues.</TE>
<TE>   She said the department takes "very seriously" the tricky business
of making economic predictions.</TE>

<HD>Parent Accuses Coach of Rigging School's Cheerleading
Tryouts</HD>
<DH>Courts: Antelope Valley girl's beauty contest win is cited
as reason for alleged bias.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD FAUSSET</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In the suburbs of the Mojave Desert, two All-American pastimes have
historically generated passionate intensity: teenage beauty contests
and high school football.</LD>
<LD>   So when local school board member Al Beattie learned that the
latest legal challenge facing the Antelope Valley Union High School
District involved both tiaras and pompoms, he was hardly shocked.</LD>
<LD>   In documents filed this month in Los Angeles Superior Court, a
parent contends her daughter was not selected for the Quartz Hill
High School cheerleading squad by a coach who was upset the girl had
won a local beauty pageant. The parent wants the coach disciplined or
fired, according to the documents.</LD>
<TE>   The complaint, filed by parent Liz Smith, accuses coach Tammy
Stewart of rigging tryouts in the spring and denying Smith's
daughter, Kelly, now in her senior year, a spot on the squad.
Stewart, the complaint contends, was angry a friend's daughter had
lost to Kelly in the 2001 Miss Quartz Hill pageant.</TE>
<TE>   After Kelly won the pageant, the complaint contends, Stewart
"began a concerted effort to embarrass, harass and ridicule" her.
Then, when yearly tryouts rolled around, Stewart did not give Kelly
credit for complex tumbling moves she performed, and "manipulated the
scoring ... to the point where [Kelly] was not selected," according
to the complaint.</TE>
<TE>   At Quartz Hill High, girls land one of 18 coveted varsity
cheerleading spots the same way they win the title of Miss Quartz
Hill, or any of the other 16 "community queens" contests in the high
desert: by impressing a panel of judges.</TE>
<TE>   "When you don't win, you're never happy," Beattie said. "I
remember at one point my daughter ran for Miss Palmdale. I recall we
were a little miffed at the contest [when she lost]."</TE>
<TE>   In Smith's case, however, Beattie said the district has found no
evidence the tryouts were judged improperly. Quartz Hill High
Principal Barbara Willibrand conducted a thorough investigation of
the judging, Beattie said, and the board reviewed the matter again in
August at Smith's request.</TE>
<TE>   "The process appeared to be open and fair, as far as we could
determine," Beattie said. "From our review of it, there was no
prejudice issued against her."</TE>
<TE>   Beattie said he learned that Kelly, who had been a Quartz Hill
cheerleader for three years, received poor marks because she
interrupted her audition to fix a malfunctioning music track--even
though she had been told to perform through any technical glitches.</TE>
<TE>   Liz Smith declined to comment Thursday, and Stewart could not be
reached for comment. A lawyer for the school district also declined
to comment.</TE>
<TE>   "If she wasn't allowed to take some kind of math class, I would
have leaned more toward the child than the school," Beattie said.
"But there's a selection process. I remember being cut from the
baseball team in high school, and I didn't like it at all."</TE>

<HD>Lawyer Tells of Murder Suspect's Nazi Beliefs</HD>
<DH>Courts: Opening statements are presented in the fatal
beating of a homeless man.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>AMANDA COVARRUBIAS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Motivated by white supremacist beliefs, a Ventura skinhead beat a
homeless man to death at the Ventura River then joined his friends
for a night of partying on the beach, a prosecutor said Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   Robert Coffman, 19, helped kill James Richard Clark, 58, as Clark
lay in his sleeping bag in the brush-covered river bottom, Deputy
Dist. Atty. Stacy Ratner told the Ventura County jury in opening
statements in the murder trial.</LD>
<LD>   Coffman and three friends were driven to kill Clark the night of
June 29, 2001, because of a belief held by white supremacists that
homeless people are a disgrace to society and that their status "is
the lowest it can be," Ratner said. Coffman is also accused of
stabbing another man, Daniel McGrath, the following night at the
city's seaside promenade.</LD>
<TE>   The four teenagers lived a lifestyle marked by drinking and
pot-smoking, the prosecutor said. During a search of Coffman's
residence, Ratner said, detectives discovered Nazi paraphernalia,
including a picture Coffman drew depicting swastikas and the number
88, skinhead lingo for "Heil Hitler."</TE>
<TE>   The prosecutor said the drawing included a statement espoused by
the racist group the Order: "We must secure the existence of our
people and the future for white children."</TE>
<TE>   Defense lawyer Kay Duffy agreed that Coffman and his friends
smoked pot, drank excessively and engaged in criminal activity. But
she said Coffman was not the instigator in the crimes he is charged
with.</TE>
<TE>   "The evidence will show that they were stupid kids ... stupid
kids," Duffy said. "And the evidence will show that Robert Coffman
was criminally involved, but to what degree is for you to decide once
you have heard the evidence."</TE>
<TE>   The four teenagers stumbled upon Clark that Friday night as they
were cruising around the riverbed on their bicycles looking for a keg
party, Ratner told the jury.</TE>
<TE>   Clark, who often slept in an area near the river mouth called Hobo
Jungle, was lying in his bag surrounded by his possessions, including
a backpack, a portable radio and a coffee can holdings some pennies,
Ratner said.</TE>
<TE>   The young men pelted Clark with the pennies "just for the sheer
entertainment of harassing an old man" and took off with his
belongings to a graffiti-marked tree nearby. One of the teens, John
Becker, realized he had left behind his bong, a pipe-like device for
smoking marijuana.</TE>
<TE>   The young men went back to Clark to get the bong and inexplicably
began to attack him, Ratner said in her presentation.</TE>
<TE>   "They kicked him over and over again in the head, the arm and the
back and hit him on the head twice with the bong," Ratner told the
jury. "He hit him so hard, the bong broke."</TE>
<TE>   She showed the jury a photograph of the broken bong and a rock at
the site spattered with blood from a shoe. She said the scene was
indicative of a "boot party," an act of violence by white
supremacists who kick and stomp a victim in the head.</TE>
<TE>   Clark, who weighed 123 pounds, most likely died about an hour
later, Ratner said. "He never got out of his sleeping bag," she said.
Detectives found an empty wallet and some McDonald's vouchers in his
pocket.</TE>
<TE>   After the beating, the young men left to go look for a party, she
said. They joined some people at the beach and started smoking and
drinking, Ratner said.</TE>
<TE>   The teens spent the next day hanging out with some teenage girls
at a nearby apartment complex and "got ready for another day of
partying," the prosecutor said.</TE>
<TE>   That night, they headed to the beach again to find another party
and hooked up with a known skinhead named Kenny Valentine, Ratner
said. At the seaside promenade, they ran into Daniel McGrath, an
acquaintance, who was sitting on a bench with his girlfriend.</TE>
<TE>   Valentine was upset with McGrath for supposedly making a previous
reference about Valentine's grandmother, Ratner said. Valentine, who
was drunk and "out of control," began screaming at McGrath and hit
him once with an open hand. Valentine hit him again and created "the
beginning of a blood trail," Ratner said.</TE>
<TE>   "The only one armed was Mr. Coffman," she said. "He had a knife in
his pocket."</TE>
<TE>   Coffman, who has a swastika tattooed on his arm, pulled the knife
on McGrath, jumped on his back and stabbed him five times, Ratner
said. Coffman denied any involvement in both incidents but changed
his story later and said he had been at the scenes of each incident
and had stabbed McGrath.</TE>
<TE>   "Both men suffered the wrath and violence that Mr. Coffman was
able to push upon them--and only one of them survived," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Coffman is the second suspect to be tried in Clark's death. Rocky
Mattley, 15, was convicted of second-degree murder earlier this year
and was committed to the California Youth Authority. Testimony in the
Coffman trial will begin Monday.</TE>

<LD>Authorities across Orange County were looking Thursday for a
25-year-old man who shot at a Garden Grove patrolman and then called
investigators threatening to kill people at random if the search for
him doesn't stop. He also threatened to kill a police officer.</LD>
<LD>   Jacob T. Marchesano of Huntington Beach is thought to be in an
unbalanced emotional state, given his conversations with police.
"This guy is very dangerous," Garden Grove Lt. Scott Hamilton said.
His "emotional level varies from calm to very agitated. He may have
psychiatric issues."</LD>
<LD>   Police say Marchesano shot at an officer late Monday after bolting
from a pickup truck in which he was a passenger during a routine
traffic stop.</LD>
<TE>   Officer Pat Gildea, who wasn't injured, attempted to pull the
vehicle over about 11:30 p.m. The driver wouldn't stop, and the
passenger jumped out and ran. Gildea followed the pickup but suddenly
found himself under fire by the suspect, who then ran away.</TE>
<TE>   Police later arrested the vehicle's driver, Richard Joseph Martin,
35, of Huntington Beach. He is being held in Huntington Beach City
Jail on suspicion of attempting to kill a police officer.</TE>
<TE>   The gunman, identified as Marchesano, called investigators
Wednesday after learning that police had contacted his family and
friends. He threatened to begin shooting people at random and to
"kill the next police officer I see" if police didn't "back off,"
Hamilton said. Marchesano may be driving a gray 2000 Ford Ranger with
California license plate 6E70277, police said. Hamilton said
Marchesano has a "violent criminal history" as a juvenile but would
not elaborate.</TE>

<LD>A Sylmar man accused of running over and killing an 'N Sync fan as
she waited outside a Burbank radio station pleaded not guilty
Thursday to a murder charge.</LD>
<LD>   Cameron Duty, 23, made a brief appearance in Pasadena Superior
Court, where he was arraigned in the death of Anna White, 21, who was
run down Sept. 9 outside the studios of KIIS-FM (102.7).</LD>
<LD>   Duty, who remains in custody in lieu of $1-million bail, backed
his pickup over White and dragged her for more than a block before
leaving the area without calling authorities, Burbank police said.</LD>
<TE>   Witnesses told police that Duty was playing loud music from his
truck's stereo and appeared to be intoxicated at the time of the
incident, Burbank Police Lt. Tim Stehr said.</TE>
<TE>   A preliminary hearing was set for Oct. 29. Duty's attorney, Eddie
Tolmas, said he would not comment on the specifics of the case. He
said more time was needed to obtain and review additional evidence.</TE>
<TE>   White, a Burbank resident and student at the Fashion Institute of
Design &amp; Merchandising in Los Angeles, was waiting to see 'N Sync
singer Justin Timberlake when she was hit, police said.</TE>
<TE>   She died a short time later at Providence St. Joseph Medical
Center in Burbank.</TE>

<HD>Family and Friends Salute a Fallen Deputy</HD>
<DH>Funeral: An Orange County sheriff's sergeant killed in the
line of duty is recalled as religious, fun-loving.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MAI TRAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>An Orange County sheriff's deputy who died following an on-duty
traffic accident was remembered Thursday as a proud husband and
father with a playful sense of humor and boundless compassion.</LD>
<LD>   It was fitting, Orange County Sheriff Michael S. Carona told those
who gathered for the patrolman's funeral, that one hour after Sgt.
Matthew Davis died, his wife, Tammy, asked to meet the 17-year-old
high school girl who had struck her husband's motorcycle. The two
prayed together.</LD>
<LD>   "I don't know what they said," Carona said, fighting tears. "But
that was how they were."</LD>
<TE>   About 3,000 people, including representatives of law enforcement
agencies from around the state, attended the 2  1/2-hour funeral
service at Saddleback Church in Lake Forest. Davis, a father of three
and a 16-year veteran, died Sunday, two days after the accident.</TE>
<TE>   Following the service, a motorcade--large enough to snarl traffic
on the Riverside Freeway--traveled to Crestlawn Memorial Park in
Riverside, where Davis was buried. He had spent nearly his entire
life in nearby Corona.</TE>
<TE>   Davis, 38, was on motorcycle patrol in Mission Viejo when he was
struck by the girl's car.</TE>
<TE>   Despite their grief, family, friends and co-workers took time to
laugh.</TE>
<TE>   Don Miskulin said he met Davis 25 years ago when his new friend
moved to Corona. He recalled Davis' varied attempts to fit in. "He
was a punker, a skater, a surfer, and if you can believe it, even a
preppy."</TE>
<TE>   He said the two of them would deliver newspapers in the early
hours and then meet--every morning--at a doughnut shop for apple
fritters and coffee. They pulled pranks on teachers, traveled to
Mexico to surf and climbed Mt. Whitney.</TE>
<TE>   "Everyone has a best friend, but best friends can change. They
come and go," said Miskulin, now a Riverside County sheriff's deputy.
"But Matt was the one in a lifetime. He was forever."</TE>
<TE>   Davis loved tinkering, friends said. He took apart a clock radio
to see how it worked and once bought an old Volkswagen sedan and
rebuilt the engine, only to have it break down three times in the
next 18 months.</TE>
<TE>   Davis, friends said, was a deeply religious man who volunteered at
his church and attended services each Sunday morning, sitting in the
front row with a Bible in one hand and taking notes with the other.</TE>
<TE>   At work, Davis, who supervised 31 motorcycle deputies in southern
Orange County, always made time for others, said Sgt. Steve Doan, a
co-worker. Even cranky callers felt inclined to thank him for his
sunny attitude, Doan said.</TE>
<TE>   "He expected the best from his troops and even more from himself,
and he always delivered," Carona said.</TE>
<TE>   Five large monitors showed pictures of a smiling Davis hugging his
children--John, 13, Jessica, 11, and Julianna, 7--his wedding
picture, hiking with friends along the John Muir Wilderness Trail and
on his patrol motorcycle.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know why God took Matt," Miskulin said. "We weren't ready
to give him up."</TE>

<HD>Renters Rally for Bill Protecting Security Deposits</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOCELYN Y. STEWART</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Earlier this month Gov. Gray Davis won praise for signing a bill that
requires landlords to give tenants 60 days notice before terminating
a lease, rather than 30 days.</LD>
<LD>   Now renters are asking for a repeat, calling on Davis to sign
legislation that would change how landlords handle security deposits.</LD>
<LD>   At a rally Thursday outside a federal building in downtown Los
Angeles, demonstrators presented letters to the governor's staff
asking him to sign AB 2330, which tenants say will help prevent
landlords from unfairly keeping security deposits.</LD>
<TE>   "This bill is urgent," said James Williams, a member of the Assn.
of Community Organizations for Reform Now (ACORN). "A lot of renters
are being ripped off."</TE>
<TE>   The governor has not made a decision on the bill, said Byron C.
Tucker, the governor's deputy press secretary.</TE>
<TE>   "Gov. Davis is aware of the problems out there concerning
renters," Tucker said. "He's taken actions on these issues in the
past. This is one of the bills he'll be taking a close look at."</TE>
<TE>   Tenants argue that landlords often keep security deposits rather
than returning them.</TE>
<TE>   Before moving out of a Pasadena apartment, Williams and his wife
cleaned it, shampooed the carpet and painted the walls. They were
hoping their $450 deposit would be returned.</TE>
<TE>   "We were denied any part of our security deposit back," Williams
said. "We had to take a loss. There was nothing we could do."</TE>
<TE>   Under AB 2330, sponsored by Assemblywoman Carole Migden (D-San
Francisco), tenants could request an inspection before moving out.
Tenants could then make repairs and clean the unit, so that money
would not be deducted from the deposit. The bill also stiffens
penalties for landlords who illegally withhold payments.</TE>
<TE>   Apartment owners oppose the bill, including the 50,000-member
California Apartment Assn. based in Sacramento. "Many owners have
requested that the governor veto," said Debra Carlton, a spokeswoman
for the association.</TE>
<TE>   Owners oppose the bill because it allows inspections while the
tenant's property is still in the unit, preventing owners from fully
seeing the unit's condition. Any tenant may request a walk-through
inspection, even those who may pose a danger to a landlord or
manager, Carlton said.</TE>
<TE>   But at least one landlord supports the governor signing the bill.
The group demonstrating outside the federal building included
77-year-old Louise Davis, a resident of South Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm a landlord, but my children's children might need this one
day," she said. "I just think things should be fair. Landlords should
have some feelings for others."</TE>

<LD>Faced with evidence of a massive die-off of salmon and the prospect

emergency release of water from Upper Klamath Lake into the lower
Klamath River.</LD>
<LD>   "What's happening on the lower river right now, we don't
understand," bureau Commissioner John Keyes said late Thursday. "But
we're trying to get an understanding to see if something needs to be
done differently."</LD>
<LD>   Keyes said 10,000 acre-feet of water will be released from the
lake in coming days and allowed to flow downstream to the lower
Klamath, where at least 12,000 salmon have died since last week.</LD>
<TE>   Commercial fishermen and environmentalists blamed the fish kill on
the Bush administration's decision to divert water from the river to
increase deliveries to farmers in the Klamath Basin. Joined by Rep.
Mike Thompson (D-St. Helena), the coalition, led by the Pacific Coast
Federation of Fishermen's Assns., filed a lawsuit in U.S. District
Court in Oakland challenging the federal government's 10-year
operating plan for the river.</TE>
<TE>   The suit alleges that the Bureau of Reclamation's plan leaves
insufficient flows for fish.</TE>
<TE>   The groups said the policy violates the Endangered Species Act
because water reductions threaten the coho salmon that will soon
enter the Klamath for their annual spawning run. Most of the dead
fish were wild or hatchery-raised chinook salmon.</TE>
<TE>   Glen Spain of the Pacific Coast Federation said his group would
not drop the lawsuit because of the emergency release.</TE>
<TE>   "This suit is about water for the future," Spain said. "The whole
10-year plan is flawed, and we shouldn't have to get a release on an
ad hoc basis each year. There should have been more water in the
river to prevent a kill in the first place."</TE>
<TE>   Keyes said the announcement of the release was not in response to
the lawsuit.</TE>
<TE>   When the plan was unveiled in December, the bureau's parent
agency, the U.S. Department of Interior, said it offered an
innovative way to build consensus among farmers and fishermen while
increasing future flows for salmon.</TE>
<TE>   Keyes on Thursday reaffirmed the plan's validity, saying one of
its strengths is that it can be amended when more information about
the current fish kill is available. The National Academy of Sciences
is to release a report in March on what flow rates are needed to
ensure the survival of salmon.</TE>
<TE>   But many remain skeptical that the plan will ever solve the
region's water wars.</TE>
<TE>   "The administration wants to use what they are doing on the
Klamath as a model for other water issues in the West; and if this is
what they are planning to do, it's doomed to disaster," said Jonathan
Birdsong, a legislative aide to Thompson.</TE>
<TE>   The fish are believed to have been killed by gill rot, which
salmon are vulnerable to when river water becomes too warm. None of
the fish that died reached their upstream spawning grounds.</TE>

<HD>Lockyer Calls for New Studies on Ahmanson</HD>
<DH>Development: The attorney general threatens to block the
mini-city. But a company spokesman says building will start next
year.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DARYL KELLEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Atty. Gen. Bill Lockyer has weighed in against the controversial
Ahmanson Ranch housing project at the western edge of the San
Fernando Valley, calling for a full new environmental study,
threatening to block the development unless he is certain it abides
by state law and supporting the sale of the ranch to a public agency.</LD>
<LD>   Lockyer, whose office has intervened to halt projects for
environmental reasons statewide, said in an interview that old
Ahmanson Ranch studies are so dated that new ones are needed to judge
the effects of the 3,050-home mini-city on roads, wildlife and the
surrounding natural environment.</LD>
<LD>   Another broad study could take years and further delay the
$2-billion project approved by Ventura County in 1992, but stalled by
legal challenges and environmental issues.</LD>
<TE>   A supplemental study on survival of a rare frog and flower is
underway, but Lockyer said it does not go far enough.</TE>
<TE>   "There's been considerable growth in the area since the previous
studies were conducted," Lockyer said. "I think it's essential that
we do an updated analysis of traffic and land use." If Lockyer is not
satisfied that the new limited study meets legal requirements, "we're
prepared to join litigation" to stop the project.</TE>
<TE>   Lockyer, whose office represents three state agencies studying the
Ahmanson Ranch plan, said that instead of construction, he favors
preservation of the 2,800-acre ranch of grazing land and oak savannas
through purchase by a public agency such as the state's Santa Monica
Mountains Conservancy.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a wonderful spot for preserving open space and for
recreation and its trails system," he said. "So it would be nice if
we could add to the conservancy most, if not all, of this property."</TE>
<TE>   Tim McGarry, a spokesman for Ahmanson Ranch owner Washington
Mutual Bank, said it's unfortunate that Lockyer took his stand before
he had read the updated supplemental report released this week by a
Ventura County consultant.</TE>
<TE>   The consultant found that a new traffic study was not necessary
and that the project could go forward without substantial
environmental harm if developers do more to protect a threatened
red-legged frog and an endangered spineflower discovered at the ranch
in 1999.</TE>
<TE>   McGarry said builders still plan to break ground on Ahmanson Ranch
next year, once Ventura County approves the supplemental study.</TE>
<TE>   "We think it will become evident to the attorney general's people,
once they review the document, that Ahmanson Ranch is in full
compliance with the [law]," McGarry said. "The supplemental report
... rigorously analyzes all changed circumstances and all new
information.... California's political leadership," he added, "needs
to take the state housing crisis seriously."</TE>
<TE>   Most Los Angeles politicians and many Valley residents oppose it.
Los Angeles County critics say they would suffer the project's
negative effects--crowded roads, polluted air and water--while
Ventura County would receive its tax benefits.</TE>
<TE>   Developers argue that the project is a model of modern
"smart-growth" planning that puts jobs and homes close together while
addressing a regional housing shortage.</TE>

<HD>Accused Ex-Priest Reveals His Struggle</HD>
<DH>Crime: Facing sex abuse charges, the Orange man says: 'I
regret and have shame about this.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRISTINE HANLEY and MONTE MORIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A former priest charged with sexually abusing a teenage girl with
whom he fathered a child nearly three decades ago expressed regret
Thursday for what happened and said he's praying for the woman.</LD>
<LD>   In an interview a day after he was released from jail on $50,000
bail, Gerald J. Plesetz spoke candidly about his struggles in the
Roman Catholic Church and his decision to give up the priesthood soon
after the woman--identified by authorities as "Janet M."--became
pregnant.</LD>
<LD>   "I regret and have shame about this," Plesetz said. "I pray and
sincerely hope that Janet isn't scarred from this."</LD>
<TE>   Plesetz, 59, was arrested Tuesday on three counts of oral
copulation with a minor under the age of 16, becoming the first
priest to be criminally charged with sexual abuse in Los Angeles and
Orange counties since the Roman Catholic sex scandal broke nine
months ago. On Wednesday, Los Angeles authorities arrested two other
priests accused of molestation.</TE>
<TE>   The Orange County Sheriff's Department arrested Plesetz after he
allegedly confessed to an undercover officer posing as his
out-of-wedlock daughter.</TE>
<TE>   Plesetz would not discuss specifics of the allegations against
him, saying he has not yet talked to an attorney.</TE>
<TE>   The closest Plesetz came to explaining his relationship with Janet
M. was when he described how lonely it was working in south Orange
County during the 1970s, when the alleged crimes occurred.</TE>
<TE>   He was assigned to St. Edward Catholic Church in Dana Point, where
Janet M. sang in the choir. The area, he said, was far removed from
the fellow priests he befriended through the Archdiocese of Los
Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   "Dana Point was an outpost of the diocese.... You lose a sense of
community and camaraderie with your fellow priests," he said. "I was
in an isolated situation."</TE>
<TE>   Plesetz said he left the church because he wanted to have a
family.</TE>
<TE>   "I left once I was clear about what I wanted in my life," he said.</TE>
<TE>   He married his wife, Sandy, a flight attendant, in December 1977.</TE>
<TE>   The couple had a daughter in 1984. A year later, Sandy died of
cancer. Plesetz has been a single father ever since.</TE>
<TE>   With his second daughter, now 18, never straying far from his side
during Thursday's interview, Plesetz said he's tried to be honest
with everyone close to him about his first daughter. The girl was
given up for adoption and, according to Plesetz, has been receiving
child support payments from him over the years.</TE>
<TE>   "Anyone I ever got close to knew," he said. "It would not be fair
for them not to know."</TE>
<TE>   But the bishop of a church where Plesetz served as a part-time
priest said Thursday he was shocked when he heard the allegations
this summer.</TE>
<TE>   Plesetz served at St. Matthew Church in Orange from 1997 until
July of this year, according to Bishop Peter Hickman. St. Matthew
Church is affiliated with the Old Catholic ecumenical movement and
allows priests to marry.</TE>
<TE>   Hickman received a letter in July from the Los Angeles Archdiocese
reporting allegations of misconduct against Plesetz.</TE>
<TE>   Hickman said he met with Plesetz and another priest on July 16 and
confronted him with the accusations.</TE>
<TE>   "He said it was true and he apologized for not telling us before,"
Hickman said.</TE>
<TE>   "He said he had carried this for the last 27 or 28 years and that
he has always regretted it. He feels he was very immature at the time
and that it was a very foolish and very terrible thing that he did.
It happened when he was newly ordained."</TE>
<TE>   Plesetz said he plans to return to his job as an administrator
with the Orange County Health Care Agency next week. He took the job
in 1986 because it allowed him to help people--as a priest
would--while being allowed to have a family.</TE>
<TE>   At his home in Orange on Thursday, he tried to relax by strumming
his guitar and--in what he called a symbolic gesture--listening to
Bob Dylan sing "I Shall Be Released."</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Roman C. Pucinski, 83, a former journalist and fixture of Chicago
politics who served five terms in Congress, died Wednesday of
pneumonia.</LD>
<LD>   A longtime leader in Chicago's Polish community, Pucinski spent 13
years in Congress and 20 years on the Chicago City Council.</LD>
<LD>   He was born in Chicago and educated in its public schools,
followed by Northwestern University and John Marshall Law School in
Chicago. While an undergraduate, he became a reporter for the Chicago
Times, later the Sun-Times. He continued to work as a journalist
while in law school, but never took the bar exam because he was
preoccupied with coverage of the 1948 presidential election.</LD>
<TE>   During World War II, he served in the Army Air Corps and flew 49
missions over Japan. He was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross
and the Air Medal with Clusters.</TE>
<TE>   Pucinski spent 20 years as a reporter with the Chicago Sun-Times
before being elected to Congress as a Democrat in 1958. He was
reelected five times before an unsuccessful run for the U.S. Senate
in 1972 against incumbent Republican Charles Percy. The next year, he
ran for alderman from the 41st Ward on Chicago's Northwest side. He
won, and held the seat until his retirement from the council in 1991.</TE>

J.D. Hayworth (R-Ariz.), confirmed Thursday. He was 98.</LD>
<LD>   Hayworth, who worked in baseball for more than 50 years, spent 15
seasons in the majors as a catcher, almost all of them with the
Detroit Tigers.</LD>
<LD>   Hayworth came to the majors in 1926 and was a member of Detroit's
World Series teams in 1934 and 1935. He set an American League record
for most consecutive fielding chances by a catcher without an error
at 439 from Sept. 2, 1931, to Aug. 29, 1932, and his glove is in the
Hall of Fame. The record was broken by Hall of Famer Yogi Berra.</LD>
<TE>   Hayworth also played with the Brooklyn Dodgers, the New York
Giants and the St. Louis Browns. He had a career batting average of
.265.</TE>
<TE>   Fred Smith, the Detroit Tigers' historian and secretary of the
team's alumni organization, said Hayworth "was a good man."</TE>
<TE>   "He was a good player, the kind you liked on the ball field,"
Smith said. "Ray always had time to talk to the kids. He was a real
good guy."</TE>
<TE>   After retiring in 1945, Hayworth worked for the Brooklyn Dodgers
as a scout. In an interview with the Denver Post some years ago, he
recalled scouting the Negro Leagues and assessing such top players as
Jackie Robinson, Don Newcombe and Jim Gilliam. Robinson broke the
color barrier in baseball in 1947.</TE>
<TE>   Hayworth later worked for the Chicago Cubs, the Milwaukee and
Atlanta Braves, and the Montreal Expos. He retired from the Expos in
1973.</TE>
<TE>   Complete information on his survivors was not immediately
available.</TE>

<HD>Film Agency for Valley City Is Advocated</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>San Fernando Valley mayoral candidate Keith Richman on Thursday said
a Valley city should take over film permitting in its area from the
Entertainment Industry Development Corp., which is under criminal
investigation for alleged misuse of funds.</LD>
<LD>   "There are too many questions concerning the EIDC," said Richman,
one of 10 Valley mayoral candidates in the Nov. 5 secession election.
"I will [make] sure that all permit fees stay in the new Valley
city."</LD>
<LD>   The EIDC, a quasi-public agency that handles film permits for the
city and other local jurisdictions, has become an issue in the
secession campaign because it contributed $25,000 to Mayor James K.
Hahn's anti-breakup effort.</LD>
<TE>   Hahn, who had solicited the donation, returned the money after
questions were raised on whether the EIDC can legally make political
contributions, since some believe the permit fees it collects are
public funds.</TE>
<TE>   The district attorney's office is examining a range of EIDC
spending practices, including campaign contributions.</TE>
<TE>   "There clearly is confusion about whether EIDC is a public
agency," Richman said.</TE>
<TE>   "There should be no question issuing film permits is a public
function."</TE>

<HD>Fee for Anti-Tobacco Law Firms Thrown Out</HD>
<DH>Ruling: New York judge says arbitrators exceeded authority
in awarding $1.25 billion to the Castano group. Cigarette makers hail
decision.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MYRON LEVIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A New York judge has thrown out $1.25 billion in legal fees awarded
to a group of anti-tobacco law firms, ruling that arbitrators
exceeded their authority in granting the fees for work in a single
California case.</LD>
<LD>   The decision by state court Judge Nicholas Figueroa was a victory
for R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co. and other cigarette makers, who had
challenged the July award as grossly excessive. The ruling was "a
huge victory for common sense," said Mark Smith, a spokesman for
Brown &amp; Williamson Tobacco Corp., which had joined RJR and Lorillard
Inc. in challenging the arbitration award.</LD>
<LD>   It was a setback for the Castano group, a nationwide consortium of
60 law firms that has battled the industry for years but gone unpaid,
while other plaintiffs' firms reaped a windfall. Castano lawyer David
Ellenhorn said that the ruling will be appealed, and that Figueroa
had erroneously substituted his judgment for that of the arbitrators,
who carefully considered the "contributions that our clients made" to
the litigation settlement between the industry and the states.</LD>
<TE>   Although the dispute involved a tobacco case in California, the
challenge was filed in New York, where arbitrators heard the case and
rendered their 2-1 decision.</TE>
<TE>   Figueroa's ruling was unusual because courts generally are loath
to second-guess decisions made through binding arbitration.</TE>
<TE>   In his ruling, Figueroa said the panel majority improperly sought
to compensate the Castano group for its strenuous work in the tobacco
wars, when the issue before it was how much the group deserved for
its modest effort in a single matter--a California class action
called the Ellis case.</TE>
<TE>   Figueroa said the arbitration contract called for paying the
Castano group only for work done "in connection with" Ellis, which
was settled along with suits by California's attorney general and its
largest cities and counties.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, the judge said, the panel considered the Castano group's
broader contributions to the tobacco litigation, culminating in the
industry's agreement to pay $246 billion to the states, including $25
billion to California.</TE>
<TE>   "This overstepping was the result of the majority panels'
inclination towards an irrelevant appreciation of [the Castano
group's] ... worthy ... but unremunerative litigation during the
better part of a decade," according to Figueroa's 16-page ruling.
"Whatever the merits of [the Castano group's] laudable efforts during
the tobacco wars, the rationale chosen by this panel to reward those
efforts exceeded their power under the arbitration clause."</TE>
<TE>   As part of their 1998 settlement with state attorneys general,
cigarette makers agreed to pay legal fees of the private lawyers the
states had hired to pursue the litigation. Fee disputes were to be
resolved through binding arbitration before a three-judge panel. At
least $13 billion in fees has been awarded through this process
without challenge. That includes $637 million paid to nine law firms
that represented the cities and counties of California.</TE>
<TE>   But the Castano group--named for a lung cancer victim who was a
named plaintiff in the first case it filed in 1994--has been shut out
of the party.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike the lawyers hired by the states, the Castano firms,
including several in California, filed private, class-action lawsuits
on behalf of addicted smokers in about two dozen states. Most of the
class actions have been dismissed, and only two of them survive--the
Brown case in California and a Louisiana case that is scheduled for
trial next week.</TE>
<TE>   However, a number of state attorneys general have said the Castano
group's work was invaluable in getting their cases off the ground.
Ellenhorn said the group's efforts in Ellis and the other cases were
"all one ball of wax, and ... directly contributed to" the nationwide
settlement, including California's $25 billion.</TE>

<HD>Man Shot After Holding Daughter Hostage Is Still in
Critical Condition</HD>

<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A parolee who authorities say held his 1 1/2-year-old daughter
hostage for more than 23 hours before being shot by police remained
in critical condition Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   Gabriel Anthony Leon was shot in the abdomen and buttocks about 1
p.m. Wednesday and has "pretty massive injuries," Kim Pine of UCI
Medical Center in Orange said. "Additional surgery is expected in the
near future."</LD>
<LD>   Leon, 25, was shot during a frontyard encounter with police at a
home in the 2000 block of West Wilshire Avenue in Santa Ana. His
daughter was not hurt and was released to her mother, said Santa Ana
Police Sgt. Baltazar De La Riva. When Leon is released from the
hospital, he will likely face numerous charges, De La Riva said.</LD>
<TE>   The Orange County district attorney's office also will investigate
the officer-involved shooting, said Anaheim Police Sgt. Rick
Martinez. Leon was shot by Anaheim SWAT officers called in to replace
Santa Ana officers as the standoff dragged on, Martinez said.</TE>
<TE>   The incident began about 2:30 p.m. Tuesday when Leon, who is on
parole for assault with a deadly weapon, fought with ex-girlfriend
Maribel Ramirez over custody of the girl, De La Riva said.</TE>

<HD>O.C. Residents Nervous Over PCB Readings</HD>
<DH>Safety: State examiners find the cancer-causing compound in
lawns near wetlands. Homeowners worry about health, property values.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SEEMA MEHTA and DAVE McKIBBEN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>State toxic-substance examiners, in tests that were expanded last
week, have discovered a cancer-causing compound in the lawns of homes
near the Bolsa Chica wetlands, unnerving homeowners who worry about
their exposure to the chemicals as well as their tanking property
values.</LD>
<LD>   "I would leave in a heartbeat, but I can't," said Chris Daly, who
two years ago bought a $580,000 home next to a Bankton Drive house
where moderate levels of PCBs were discovered in the lawn. "Can you
imagine what this has done to the [house's] value?"</LD>
<LD>   Daly's neighbor, Mary Ann Cross, has lived in her home for more
than two decades, and worries that the contamination investigators
found at her home--and on the adjacent land where her three grown
children played when they were little--might affect her family's
health.</LD>
<TE>   "I've done all this gardening for 25 years, and to think I've been
bringing [contaminated] dirt in this house that long," said Cross,
whose property was retested last week.</TE>
<TE>   The state Department of Toxic Substances Control found dangerously
high levels of PCBs, or polychlorinated biphenyls, earlier this year
on two acres of an undeveloped 42-acre plot next to the residential
neighborhood where Cross and Daly have homes.</TE>
<TE>   After determining that the levels at the 2-acre site were as much
as 3,220 times the federal safety standard, the department mailed
notices to 7,500 residents. The area had been fenced previously,
after preliminary tests revealed PCB contamination.</TE>
<TE>   In July, the agency tested the lawns at five homes near the site,
and found PCBs in the soil at two, both on Bankton Drive in
Huntington Beach. Some samples showed moderate to high contamination
at the two homes.</TE>
<TE>   Additional tests were conducted at those homes last week, but the
findings are not expected for some time.</TE>
<TE>   Thomas M. Cota, chief of the state agency's Southern California
cleanup operations, said, "We've met with the property owners and
subsequently done some additional sampling to characterize the nature
of the contamination. That will be used to develop a cleanup plan."</TE>
<TE>   Daly said he and some of the other residents plan to pursue legal
action if the state's cleanup plan doesn't satisfy their concerns. No
one has tested his land yet, and no one warned him of the dangers
when he bought his home.</TE>
<TE>   "Apparently it has been common knowledge for a long time, but no
one told us a thing about it," he said. "Our kids were playing right
in that area until they put that fence up."</TE>
<TE>   Until being banned nationwide in the 1970s, PCBs were used as
industrial lubricants and coolants in large electric transformers.
The man-made compound has been shown to cause cancer in animals and
is classified a "probable carcinogen" for humans. It can affect the
immune, reproductive, neurological and endocrine systems.</TE>
<TE>   It's unclear how the PCBs got into the soil of the homes or on the
adjoining 42-acre plot, known as the Fieldstone property, or how long
ago. Regulators speculate that it may have been illegally dumped at
the site.</TE>
<TE>   Hearthside Homes, developer of the Bolsa Chica mesa, bought the
Fieldstone property for $1.2 million in late 1999, and planned to
sell it to the state for the same amount so it could be added to the
wetlands restoration project that is underway. Now, it is unclear
when that sale will happen.</TE>
<TE>   The developer has entered into a consent order with the state that
dictates monitoring and cleanup, which could start in 2003.</TE>
<TE>   The cleanup will probably involve hauling the contaminated soil to
a hazardous waste landfill.</TE>
<TE>   "Certainly we are on the hook," said Lucy Dunn, Hearthside's
executive vice president. "We don't know ultimately who might
contribute to this or who's responsible for [the contamination]."</TE>

<HD>State Sues Tribe Over Reporting of Gifts</HD>
<DH>Court: The Palm Springs band, a major donor to political
campaigns, claims it is immune from disclosure laws.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAN MORAIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>California's Fair Political Practices Commission, testing the limits
of Indian sovereignty and state law, announced Thursday that it has
sued to force a Palm Springs tribe and casino operator to comply with
fundamental campaign finance and lobbying disclosure statutes.</LD>
<LD>   The Agua Caliente Band of Cahuilla Indians is one of the top
campaign spenders in California, having contributed at least $13
million to state campaigns since 1998. But like several other tribes,
the Agua Caliente band contends that it need not comply with the
Political Reform Act of 1974 because it enjoys immunity from state
law.</LD>
<LD>   The tribe balked at complying with aspects of state disclosure
rules followed by other campaign donors and groups that hire
lobbyists to influence legislation in Sacramento.</LD>
<TE>   The FPPC sued after the tribe, citing its status as a sovereign
entity that is not bound by state law, refused to settle a case
involving a series of lapses in campaign finance disclosure filings,
and its refusal to list the bills it tracked in its lobbying
operation in 2001,</TE>
<TE>   "Why would they be immune?" asked FPPC Chairwoman Karen Getman.
"Anybody who contributes major sums to campaigns in California must
let the voters know they're doing so. That is essential to the state
of California's sovereignty."</TE>
<TE>   The FPPC, concerned that delay might preclude it from suing the
tribe, initially filed a bare-bones lawsuit July 30 to comply with
the statute of limitations. The commission amended and expanded that
suit Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   The new version focuses on the tribe's alleged failure to properly
report donations in 1998, when Agua Caliente spent $7.5 million on
the campaigns of 135 candidates for the Legislature and statewide
office and on Proposition 5, which sought to legalize casinos on
tribal land.</TE>
<TE>   The campaign committee for Proposition 5, which was struck down by
the state Supreme Court in 1999, disclosed money it received from
Agua, as did candidates who took the tribe's money.</TE>
<TE>   But the FPPC alleges that the tribe failed to meet deadlines for
filing a major-donor statement, a report required of all campaign
contributors who give $10,000 or more in a year. The tribe also
failed to file late-contribution reports, required when donors give
$1,000 or more to a candidate or proposition in the closing days of a
campaign.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, the tribe filed reports in 2001 disclosing that it
lobbies, but did not fill them out fully by citing bills it was
tracking. The tribe's Sacramento lobbying firm makes no claim of
immunity, and files disclosure forms listing bills it tracks and
agencies it seeks to influence.</TE>
<TE>   The suit, filed in Sacramento County Superior Court, seeks an
injunction forcing the tribe to comply with the act. It also seeks
damages, which could amount to as much as $7.5 million.</TE>
<TE>   Agua attorney Art Bunce declined to comment, except to refer calls
to the tribe's Web site, www.aguacaliente.org. The site contains
various filings that appear to comply with state disclosure law.</TE>
<TE>   "Under federal law," the tribe's Web site says, "the tribe is not
required to provide this information to the FPPC at all, but the
tribe chooses to do so voluntarily.... With this voluntary
information from the tribe, the FPPC can match up what the tribe
reports with what the recipients of its donations and others report,
and thus verify the accuracy of the reports."</TE>
<TE>   The Agua Caliente band was a relatively late entrant in casino
gambling. But it has become one of the most successful, operating its
Spa Resort Casino in perhaps the single best location of any Indian
casino in the state: downtown Palm Springs. The tribe also is a major
political player, donating $426,000 to state candidates in the first
half of this year, including $77,000 to Gov. Gray Davis. The tribe
has contributed $127,000 to Davis since he took office.</TE>
<TE>   Davis, who had no comment on the lawsuit, appointed Getman to her
post as chairwoman of the Fair Political Practices Commission. Getman
said she did not inform Davis of the lawsuit before filing it.</TE>
<TE>   The question of whether Indian tribes must comply with the
Political Reform Act attracted attention in 2000 when California
Common Cause filed a massive complaint alleging hundreds of reporting
errors by tribes and other gambling interests.</TE>
<TE>   "It is long overdue," Jim Knox, head of the private watchdog
group, said of Thursday's action. Knox appeared at a commission
meeting last December, and criticized the FPPC for citing card clubs
and horse racing interests but not Indian tribes.</TE>
<TE>   "If the commission is uncertain of its authority, let's get it
resolved," Knox said then. "Let's take an enforcement action. Let's
fight it out in the courts. It is in the public interest to resolve
this issue."</TE>
<TE>   At the December hearing, FPPC officials said they were uncertain
that the Political Reform Act, a post-Watergate law approved by
voters in 1974, applied to the tribes, given their general immunity
from lawsuits and various state laws.</TE>
<TE>   On Thursday, Getman said the commission now is certain of its
position. She said state law permits any individual, corporation or
other entity--except foreign nationals--to contribute to state
political races. Tribes, she said, have every right to remain
involved in politics, so long as they comply with state law. If they
don't comply, Getman said, "from our point of view, they should stop"
donating.</TE>

<HD>Luxury Homes Set for Ex-Base</HD>
<DH>Development: Two companies acquire 238 acres of the old
Tustin Marine site, for up to 1,910 dwellings.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DARYL STRICKLAND and EVAN HALPER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The unnamed companies that were quietly buying up parcels at the
closed Tustin Marine base have revealed themselves--as well as their
plan to transform a large chunk of the ramshackle base into a colony
of luxury homes.</LD>
<LD>   Operating under the name HomeHelp and spending a total of $208
million in three online auctions, Lennar Homes and William Lyon Homes
acquired 238 acres on the base from the Navy. As the last auction
closed Thursday, ending a frantic scramble among developers in a rare
opportunity for prime land in Orange County, the companies disclosed
their identities.</LD>
<LD>   They beat about a dozen competitors for the right to build up to
1,910 homes on the land. Of the 238 acres, 172 lie within Tustin city
limits and the remainder in Irvine. The homes will be built at an
average of seven to 12 to the acre in communities that will be called
Tustin Villas, Moffett Meadows and Marble Mountain. Those communities
will include at least 292 homes priced for moderate incomes.</LD>
<TE>   But the companies say they have even bigger plans. They hope the
acquisitions have positioned them to become the master builder for
the 1,600-acre base. Tustin officials envision a hotel, office space,
schools, a golf course and 2,690 more homes. The master developer to
complete the project will be named by the city later.</TE>
<TE>   "We're hoping this gives us a leg up to be master developer of the
base," said Bob Santos, a division president at Lennar. The builders
intend to break ground on their project by the end of 2003.</TE>
<TE>   Lennar, which has been in the forefront of redeveloping military
bases, is also working on a pair of naval bases in the Bay Area: Mare
Island in Vallejo and Hunter's Point in San Francisco.</TE>
<TE>   At the Tustin base, old military housing sits on the parcels
Lennar and William Lyon acquired. Those buildings will be razed to
make way for neighborhoods of luxury suburban homes similar to those
in neighboring tracts.</TE>
<TE>   The Tustin base is considered a plum property, near major freeways
and employment centers in Santa Ana and Irvine.</TE>

<HD>O.C. May Seek Shield Against Water Lawsuits</HD>
<DH>Sewage: As treatment plants are being built, sanitation
district wants protection against any claims that Clean Water Act is
being violated.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEAN O. PASCO and SEEMA MEHTA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Orange County Sanitation District is considering a controversial
legal strategy aimed at protecting the agency against lawsuits as it
moves to fully treat sewage dumped into the ocean.</LD>
<LD>   Under the plan, discussed by the district board Wednesday night,
the Environmental Protection Agency would preemptively file suit
against the district, alleging violation of federal clean water laws.
The agencies would ask a federal judge to issue a consent decree,
which would make it more difficult for environmentalists to
successfully sue the district for violating the Clean Water Act.</LD>
<LD>   District officials said the protection is needed as it moves to
improve ocean water quality. But critics said it's an unnecessary
action and that the district should focus on improving treatment
facilities as soon as possible.</LD>
<TE>   Currently, the district provides only partial treatment to the
sewage it dumps off the Huntington Beach coast. The level of
treatment is less than most sanitation districts perform and is
allowed because the agency received a special waiver from the EPA.</TE>
<TE>   This summer, the district voted not to seek an extension of the
waiver and instead moved to fully treat the sewage. But such a
conversion will take up to 11 years and cost as much as $430 million.
Without the waiver, officials said, they need protection against
possible fines and lawsuits while treatment plants are built.</TE>
<TE>   "We think this is the most protective and the best mechanism
because the district is [moving to fuller treatment] voluntarily,"
said Janet Y. Hashimoto, chief of monitoring and assessment at the
EPA's San Francisco office.</TE>
<TE>   EPA officials discussed the strategy with district directors
Wednesday during a private meeting. District director Debbie Cook,
mayor of Huntington Beach, criticized the meeting, saying government
agencies cannot meet in secret with potential litigants.</TE>
<TE>   She also expressed concern over another proposal: seeking an
amendment to the Clean Water Act that would bar future fines against
the district.</TE>
<TE>   Cook said the district doesn't need these legal protections. "We
should just move ahead to reach [fuller] treatment as soon as
possible," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Some environmentalists agree.</TE>
<TE>   "The environmental community spoke with one voice about its
willingness to accept a substantial period of time for [the
sanitation district] to accomplish the upgrade," said David Beckman,
a senior attorney with the National Resources Defense Council.</TE>
<TE>   The district serves more than 2.7 million customers in central and
northern Orange County. It discharges 243 million gallons of
moderately treated sewage into the ocean daily. The waiver allows for
half of that sewage to receive two levels of treatment; the other
half gets primary treatment.</TE>
<TE>   Consent decrees have been used by other sanitation districts,
including L.A. agencies, trying to upgrade sewage treatment.</TE>
<TE>   The district is likely to get some legal protection from
Sacramento in the form of a state law.</TE>
<TE>   The bill by Assemblymen Ken Maddox (R-Garden Grove) and Bill
Campbell (R-Villa Park) exempts the district from fines as long as it
acts in good faith to move toward full sewage treatment by 2013.</TE>
<TE>   The bill passed the Legislature and is awaiting Gov. Gray Davis'
signature.</TE>

<HD>Bob Wallace, 53; Pioneer in Computer Software</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DENNIS McLELLAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Bob Wallace, a computer software pioneer and an early Microsoft
employee who struck out on his own in the early 1980s by launching
the Seattle-based Quicksoft software company, has died. He was 53.</LD>
<LD>   Wallace, who believed that being a computer programmer was the
best way to enhance the mind and in recent years sold books about
hallucinogenic and psychedelic drugs on a Web site, died at his home
Sept. 20 in San Rafael, Calif. The results of an autopsy are pending.</LD>
<LD>   As owner, president and chief programmer of Quicksoft, which he
founded in 1983, Wallace used an unorthodox marketing strategy,
called "shareware," to sell the word processing program he wrote,
PC-Write.</LD>
<TE>   Operating under the philosophy of "making a living, not a
killing," Wallace encouraged users to copy and share the $10 PC-Write
diskette and then pay to register the program after trying it out.</TE>
<TE>   Users who paid the $75 annual registration fee received the
benefits of a printed manual, telephone support, Quicksoft's
newsletters and two program updates.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't worry about the people who don't register," Wallace told
Associated Press in 1989. "I worry about the people who do register.
I want to make sure they're happy. If they're happy and we're making
a reasonable profit, that's good."</TE>
<TE>   By 1989, the company had 32 employees and annual sales of more
than $2 million.</TE>
<TE>   More than 10,000 people wound up paying the registration fee,
Megan Dana-Wallace, Wallace's wife, said Thursday. But a lot of users
didn't pay to register.</TE>
<TE>   "They just used it for free, so we never really got rich doing
that," said Dana-Wallace, Quicksoft's first employee and an artist,
who drew Quicksoft's trademark "office cat" on the company's
literature. (The cat, Microsoft, is now 19 years old.)</TE>
<TE>   Dana-Wallace, who was separated from Wallace at the time of his
death, said her husband enjoyed doing new things.</TE>
<TE>   "He was a real innovator," she said.</TE>
<TE>   "His idea was as long as we could make a living doing it, that was
all we needed, and more people would be able to use the product," she
said.</TE>
<TE>   "He was basically an old hippie."</TE>
<TE>   Said Jonathan Feil, a Seattle software-business attorney and
longtime friend of Wallace's:</TE>
<TE>   "Bob was a very early enthusiast in microcomputers as a way of
giving people the potential to change their lives, and like many
others in the pioneer [days of computers], he was more interested in
doing good than necessarily doing well."</TE>
<TE>   In 1991, with Quicksoft unprofitable and requiring more of
Wallace's money to keep it going, he sold the company.</TE>
<TE>   He continued working for Quicksoft's new owner until the company
went out of business in 1993.</TE>
<TE>   He was born in Washington, D.C., in 1949. His father, Robert
Wallace, was an economist who became an assistant secretary of the
Treasury during the Kennedy administration.</TE>
<TE>   The younger Wallace set the course of his life in motion at age
11.</TE>
<TE>   "I read a Reader's Digest article, 'The Man Who Talked to
Machines,' " he told Associated Press.</TE>
<TE>   "I was one of the people who just knew, then, I would be a
programmer," he added.</TE>
<TE>   He first worked on computers as a member of an Explorer Scout
troop sponsored by Control Data Corp. in Bethesda, Md.</TE>
<TE>   He later studied computers at Brown University and was one of the
key designers of an early computer file retrieval and editing system
known as Fress.</TE>
<TE>   Wallace moved to Seattle to study computers at the University of
Washington, where he earned a master's degree in computer science in
1978.</TE>
<TE>   By then, he had founded the Northwest Computer Society and had run
the first Seattle Personal Computer Fair.</TE>
<TE>   He was working at Seattle's first computer store in 1978 when he
saw a sign posted by young Bill Gates seeking programmers for his
tiny new company, then based in Albuquerque, N.M.</TE>
<TE>   After joining Microsoft as its ninth employee, Wallace developed
an early version of the Pascal programming language.</TE>
<TE>   "Bob was a great early contributor to Microsoft," Gates said in a
statement this week.</TE>
<TE>   Wallace, his widow recalled, "was one of those very brilliant
people who just focused on something they were interested in, to the
exclusion of almost everything else. Most of the high-level people at
Microsoft were like that."</TE>
<TE>   By 1983, after five years at Microsoft, Wallace thought that he
was getting lost in the quickly expanding company and decided to go
into business for himself.</TE>
<TE>   "He basically wrote the first version of PC-Write over a
Thanksgiving weekend," Feil said.</TE>
<TE>   When Wallace quit Microsoft, three years before the company went
public, he left with 450 shares of stock options that multiplied with
numerous stock splits to more than 100,000 shares worth, at the peak
of the market, $15 million.</TE>
<TE>   After Quicksoft folded in 1993, Wallace moved to California.</TE>
<TE>   Long interested in the mind-expanding potential of psychedelic
drugs, he started Mind Books, a mail order source for books about
them, in 1996.</TE>
<TE>   Two years later, he established the Promind Foundation to fund
scientific research, public education and harm-reduction efforts
related to psychedelics.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to his widow, Wallace is survived by his mother, Luna,
of Tucson; a brother, Douglas, of Seattle; and a sister, Wendy, of
Tucson.</TE>

<HD>Village District Loses Support</HD>
<DH>Westwood: Councilman Jack Weiss agrees with merchants that
the group, financed through assessments, had not improved the area's
business climate.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARTHA GROVES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Los Angeles Councilman Jack Weiss said he has decided against
renewing the 7-year-old city-chartered entity responsible for
improving the business climate of Westwood Village.</LD>
<LD>   As of Monday, the Westwood Village Community Alliance, as the
business improvement district is known, will no longer be authorized
to collect assessments from property owners in the area. However, its
obligations to maintain and protect Westwood Village will continue
through June.</LD>
<LD>   Many merchants have expressed dissatisfaction with the Westwood
district, which they say has failed miserably in its two prime jobs:
to improve parking and to strengthen the area's retail mix. Weiss,
who agreed with many critics, decided not to support an ordinance to
keep the district alive.</LD>
<TE>   "In my view, they've poured the better part of $10 million
collected over the last several years down the drain," said Jeffrey
Abell, owner of Sarah Leonard Fine Jewelers on Westwood Boulevard and
a district board member for the last year.</TE>
<TE>   Separately, the Los Angeles County district attorney's office has
found that the district violated the Brown Act, the state's
open-meeting law.</TE>
<TE>   In a letter last week to the Westwood Village Community Alliance's
board of directors, the public integrity division of the district
attorney's office criticized the organization for failing to include
notice on its board agenda of a financial settlement with three
hotels in the area.</TE>
<TE>   On Jan. 2, 2002, the organization's leaders agreed to pay a total
of $14,675 to the Royal Palace Westwood Hotel, Hilgard House Hotel
and Claremont Hotel, which basically constituted a refund of
assessments the three had paid. The hotels had complained that they
had not received an equal share of maintenance provided by the
district.</TE>
<TE>   Weiss called the district a "flawed institution" and said he will
work with property owners to create a new organization to beautify
and maintain the area.</TE>
<TE>   Robert Walsh, the district's executive director, said the Brown
Act matter has been referred to outside lawyers.</TE>
<TE>   "We believe the finding was not complete and was based upon a very
one-sided point of view furnished to that office," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "We are exploring it further," he added.</TE>
<TE>   As to whether Walsh would remain with a reconfigured district, he
said: "There are options for the city and for the community to
consider in the weeks ahead. I, too, will also consider the options
available to me."</TE>

<AU>Robyn Norwood</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>NO. 23 OREGON STATE (4-0)</LD>
<LD>   AT NO. 18 USC (2-1)</LD>
<LD>   Kickoff: 3:30 p.m. TV: Fox Sports Net</LD>
<TE>   Line: USC by 3.</TE>
<TE>   Oregon State update: Quarterback Derek Anderson ranks second in
the nation in passing efficiency and has thrown 15 touchdown passes
and only one interception. Steven Jackson leads the Pacific 10
Conference in rushing.</TE>
<TE>   USC update: Even after losing to Kansas State last week, 27-20,
the Trojans rank third in total defense at 229.7 yards a game.
Another impressive statistic: The offensive line has given up only
three sacks in three games.</TE>
<TE>   Story line:  USC plays Oregon State, Washington State, California,
Washington and Oregon the next five weeks. That's a make-or-break
stretch.</TE>
<TE>   The pick: Oregon State. The number of inexperienced players
playing for the Trojans could cost them.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   UCLA (2-1)</TE>
<TE>   AT SAN DIEGO STATE (0-4)</TE>
<TE>   Kickoff: 11 a.m. TV: ESPN2.</TE>
<TE>   Line: UCLA by 14 1/2.</TE>
<TE>   UCLA update: The Bruins are still trying to find themselves--and
it's time, with their Pacific 10 season opening next week at Oregon
State. A romp over San Diego State would do a lot for their
confidence.</TE>
<TE>   San Diego State update: The Aztecs haven't been outgained but have
only losses to show for it. One culprit: turnovers. Still, it's
difficult to overlook quarterback Adam Hall, who has passed for more
than 500 yards in each of the last two games. Receiver J.R. Tolver
leads the nation in receptions (11) and yards per game (179.25).</TE>
<TE>   Story line: Middling Pac-10 team takes on a winless Mountain West
team looking to turn around its season.</TE>
<TE>   The pick: UCLA. But the Bruins better not dally.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   KENTUCKY (4-0)</TE>
<TE>   AT NO. 7 FLORIDA (3-1)</TE>
<TE>   Kickoff: 12:30 p.m. TV: Channel 2.</TE>
<TE>   Line: Florida by 19.</TE>
<TE>   Kentucky update:  Kentucky's victories were against Louisville,
Texas El Paso, Indiana and Middle Tennessee. Southeastern Conference
surprise: Kentucky's Jared Lorenzen--sometimes called the Hefty Lefty
and the Pillsbury Throw Boy at 6 feet 4 and 275 pounds--is the
top-rated passer in the league.</TE>
<TE>   Florida update: That 30-13 victory over Tennessee took care of the
fan uprising against Coach Ron Zook for now, and quarterback Rex
Grossman has rebounded since loss to Miami.</TE>
<TE>   Story line: This matchup looks better on paper than it's likely to
be in person. Kentucky hasn't beaten Florida since 1986 and has lost
31 of 36 since 1957.</TE>
<TE>   The pick: Florida. Take your eyes off the won-lost records and
look at the bottom line: the official line.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   NO. 20 NEBRASKA (3-1)</TE>
<TE>   AT NO. 19 IOWA STATE (4-1)</TE>
<TE>   Kickoff: 12:30 p.m. TV: None.</TE>
<TE>   Line: Pick 'em.</TE>
<TE>   Nebraska update: Seeing Iowa State ranked higher than Nebraska
must hurt Cornhusker fans almost as much as that 40-7 loss to Penn
State. Nebraska hasn't fared well on the road against ranked teams
since Frank Solich became coach: Cornhuskers are 1-6 in such games,
and have been outscored, 136-60, in the last three.</TE>
<TE>   Iowa State update: Here's your chance for another look at Seneca
Wallace, the nimble quarterback from Rancho Cordova and Sacramento
City College.</TE>
<TE>   Story line: Nebraska already proved quite beatable in that loss to
Penn State, and Iowa State is eager to step into the national
consciousness.</TE>
<TE>   The pick: Nebraska. The Cyclones have lost 23 of the last 24 to
Nebraska.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   IOWA (3-1)</TE>
<TE>   AT NO. 12 PENN STATE (3-0)</TE>
<TE>   Kickoff: 9 a.m. TV: ESPN.</TE>
<TE>   Line: Penn State by 8.</TE>
<TE>   Iowa update: The Hawkeyes have fared well against Penn State
lately, beating the Nittany Lions in Iowa City last year, but this
Penn State team has its confidence back after a 40-7 victory over
Nebraska two weeks ago. The Hawkeyes' loss was to Iowa State, 36-31.</TE>
<TE>   Penn State update: The Nittany Lions have a good running back in
Larry Johnson and a quarterback, Zack Mills, who has not thrown an
interception. They've displayed the ability to put up points and
yardage, but the defense has done a workmanlike job too.</TE>
<TE>   Story line: There's a race this season for best comeback by a
former power. Right now, Notre Dame still has the edge, but Penn
State might be gaining.</TE>
<TE>   The pick: Penn State.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   NO. 16 WASHINGTON STATE (3-1)</TE>
<TE>   AT CALIFORNIA (3-1)</TE>
<TE>   Kickoff: 2 p.m. TV: None.</TE>
<TE>   Line: No line.</TE>
<TE>   Washington State update: Quarterback Jason Gesser appears ready to
play despite dislocating a rib last week against Montana State.
Backup Matt Kegel also is expected to be available despite a sprained
knee.</TE>
<TE>   California update:  Bears' surprising start was grounded by Air
Force, knocking Cal from the top 25. Three Cal receivers combined for
13 catches and 11 drops in the loss to Air Force.</TE>
<TE>   Story line: Cal's feel-good start could be over with games against
Washington State, Washington, USC, UCLA and Oregon State ahead.</TE>
<TE>   The pick: Washington State. Maybe it would have made a difference
if the third-string quarterback had to start. Maybe not.</TE>

<HD>Athletes' Graduation Rates Hit All-Time High</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE TERRY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The NCAA got some good news Thursday that had nothing to do with
television contracts or bowl games.</LD>
<LD>   For the first time, since NCAA officials started tracking
graduation rates in 1984, Division I athletes have reached a 60%
rate, according to an NCAA report annually produced from information
collected by the U.S. Department of Education.</LD>
<LD>   The 2002 report tracked the 1995-96 freshman class. According to
the report, 60% of the athletes in Division I colleges and
universities graduated within six years, the time frame used by the
Department of Education to determine graduation success.</LD>
<TE>   That compares to a 58% graduation rate for all full-time students
at those same institutions. The rates for both groups rose two
percentage points from a year ago.</TE>
<TE>   "This is very encouraging," said Rutgers President Francis
Lawrence, who chairs the Division I Board of Directors Task Force on
Academic Reforms. "This is the first graduating class of
student-athletes who were required to have 13 high school core
classes in order to participate in athletics as freshmen. The results
show we are on the right track."</TE>
<TE>   Among Pac-10 schools, UCLA was third in athlete graduation at 73%.
UCLA and Cal shared the second-highest percentage in overall
graduation rates, 82%.</TE>
<TE>   USC ranked fourth in overall graduation rates at 73%, and tied
with Washington State in athlete rates at 62%.</TE>
<TE>   Stanford was the top Pac-10 school in overall graduation rates, at
93%, and athlete rates, 90%.</TE>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Oakland Athletics were all smiles, high-fives and handshakes on
the infield grass at Safeco Field. Then it was party time inside the
clubhouse.</LD>
<LD>   Miguel Tejada tied the game with a ninth-inning homer and Scott
Hatteberg hit a two-out, two-run double in the 10th as visiting
Oakland beat the Seattle Mariners, 5-3, Thursday, clinching the
American League West championship for the second time in three years.</LD>
<LD>   "This group of guys is so family-like," Hatteberg said. "It makes
it sweeter and it helps us. We are really excited."</LD>
<TE>   Oakland, which had failed to hold eighth-inning leads against
Seattle the previous two days, opens the AL playoffs at home Tuesday
against Minnesota. The A's are a half-game behind the New York
Yankees, who play the Angels in the first round, for home-field
advantage throughout the playoffs.</TE>
<TE>   "We can kick back, enjoy it for a while and start to work hard
again tomorrow," said Billy Koch (11-4), who pitched two innings for
the victory. "I don't know about any urgency, but we just wanted to
get it done, win, and wrap up the West."</TE>
<TE>   Chicago 3, Boston 2--Dan Wright (14-12) won his fourth consecutive
start, giving up both runs and three hits in 7 1/3 innings. Keith
Foulke got three outs for his 11th save, the 100th of his career.</TE>
<TE>   Cleveland 8, Minnesota 4--Brandon Phillips had three hits and a
career-high four RBIs and Ryan Drese (10-9) gave up three runs--two
earned--and seven hits in 6 2/3 innings to lead the Indians at
Minneapolis.</TE>
<TE>   Toronto 5, Baltimore 1--Esteban Loaiza (9-10) pitched a
five-hitter at Toronto for his third complete game this season and
ninth of his career.</TE>
<TE>   Kansas City 7, Detroit 2--Jeff Suppan (9-16) pitched a five-hitter
to win for the first time in 12 starts, and Carlos Beltran had four
RBIs at Kansas City, Mo.</TE>
<TE>   Tampa Bay at New York, ppd.--The game between the Devil Rays and
Yankees was rained out, forcing a possible makeup the day after the
scheduled end of the regular season. The game will only need to be
made up if the Yankees fall a half-game behind Oakland in the race
for home-field advantage in the AL championship series.</TE>

<HD>Team Reaches Out and Touches DiSarcina</HD>
<DH></DH>

<DL>ARLINGTON, Texas</DL>
<LD>With alcohol flying in every direction and the decibel level beyond
loud, Darin Erstad grabbed a cell phone and retreated to a relatively
dry corner of the clubhouse. As the Angels celebrated their first
playoff berth in 16 years, Erstad huddled around the phone with Tim
Salmon and Troy Percival.</LD>
<LD>   The veterans left a congratulatory message for Gary DiSarcina, the
longtime Angel shortstop who preceded Erstad as the team leader.
DiSarcina spent his entire 12-year career with the Angels, without
advancing to the playoffs, and the veterans wanted him to share in
the celebration, if only via a long-distance call.</LD>
<LD>   "I've got a lot of ghosts I'm carrying with me right now, guys
like Gary DiSarcina and Chuck Finley," Percival said. "They're here
with me right now. I hope they can enjoy this a little bit."</LD>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Percival, pitching for the first time in nine days, endured a
rocky ninth inning, fighting "rust and too much adrenaline" and
giving up a home run and a walk. At one point, second baseman Adam
Kennedy called time out and told Percival to relax and stop trying to
throw every pitch 110 mph.</TE>
<TE>   After Garret Anderson caught the fly ball that marked the final
out, he gave the ball to Percival. And what did Percival, the Angels'
closer since 1996, do with the game ball, the one that secured his
first playoff appearance?</TE>
<TE>   He tossed it somewhere in the clubhouse. He didn't remember where,
and he didn't care.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not special," he said. "If I can't hold a seven-run lead,
I've got a problem. The win was what was something special."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   What should have been a day of unqualified celebration for Angel
employees instead became a day of anxiety. Paul Pressler, the Disney
executive who served as team president and embraced the Angels, left
the company Thursday to become president of the Gap clothing company.
Disney has hired an investment bank to sell the Angels and has not
named a successor to Pressler, but the sale process could take
months, if not longer, leaving the future of the team and its
employees uncertain.</TE>
<TE>   Kevin Uhlich, the Angels' senior vice president of business
operations, and Bill Stoneman, the general manager, reported to
Pressler. Although most Disney executives have been ambivalent at
best about the Angels, Uhlich said Pressler "has been a great ally.
He's been there to help us with anything we've needed."</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The Chicago White Sox will not address Frank Thomas' future until
after the season.</LD>
<LD>   Thomas, whose strong play in September has helped bring up his
numbers after a disappointing season, could become a free agent if
the team invokes a diminished skills clause in his contract.</LD>
<LD>   That clause would reduce his base pay to $250,000 and defer most
of his $10-million salary. His current deal runs through 2006.</LD>
<TE>   "Frank has expressed to us, and he expressed it some time ago,
that it would be an internal matter handled privately between all the
concerned parties," General Manager Kenny Williams said Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Arizona Diamondback left fielder Luis Gonzalez will have surgery
Monday to repair his separated left shoulder and vows he will be
ready to play by the start of spring training.</TE>
<TE>   "This is not a career-ending injury," he said. "I will be back."</TE>

<HD>Bird, Magic Shared Moment in Passing</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Elliott Teaford</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Larry Bird will introduce Magic Johnson today at the Basketball Hall
of Fame induction ceremonies at Springfield, Mass. Bird and Johnson
were often unfriendly rivals, in battling for the 1979 NCAA
championships and in the NBA Finals.</LD>
<LD>   That changed in 1986, when they filmed a shoe commercial together
and found they had a great deal in common.</LD>
<LD>   "Both learned they were two hard-working guys from Midwestern,
blue-collar families who loved basketball," Perry A. Farrell of the
Detroit Free Press wrote of the basketball icons. "They have been
close ever since, to the point that Bird defied Celtic management and
played in Magic's Mid-Summer's Night Classic [in 1986]."</LD>
<TE>   Of Bird, Johnson told Farrell, "I had always wanted to play on the
same team with him and that night we did.</TE>
<TE>   "He didn't disappoint. Some of the passes we made were incredible.
I know he took a lot of heat for playing, but that let me know what
kind of person he was."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Trivia time: What prompted Johnson to start at center for the
Lakers in the deciding Game 6 of the 1980 NBA Finals against the
Philadelphia 76ers, a game in which he scored 42 points?</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Foes no longer: College coaches Lute Olson of Arizona and Jerry
Tarkanian of Nevada Las Vegas and Fresno State recently met and put
an end to almost 30 years of bad feelings. Many believed their
dislike began while recruiting against each other.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, according to the Arizona Daily Star, it dates to 1973-74,
when Olson replaced Tarkanian (now retired) at Long Beach State and
the 49ers were slapped with a number of NCAA sanctions handed down
during Tarkanian's tenure.</TE>
<TE>   The 49ers were 24-2 under Olson but were ineligible to play in the
NCAA tournament. Two starters were suspended over admissions
irregularities.</TE>
<TE>   Olson departed for Iowa after one season at Long Beach State.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Strange rituals: Johnette Howard of Newsday wrote recently of an
odd diversion used this season by Alfonso Soriano, New York Yankee
second baseman.</TE>
<TE>   "At 24, Soriano really isn't all that much older than some of the
Yankees' clubhouse kids and bat boys, and sometime in the course of
Soriano's wondrous season, they fell into a ritual this year,"
according to Howard. '' 'Who am I?' Soriano will ask them sometimes,
just before he goes up to hit.</TE>
<TE>   '' 'The Monster,' the clubhouse kids will reply, stifling
laughter.</TE>
<TE>   '' 'El Monstro!' Soriano repeats grandly in Spanish, nodding and
smiling in recognition of how preposterous this all is."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Trivia answer: Kareem Abdul-Jabbar could not play because of a
sprained ankle.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   And finally: Bob Wolfley, Milwaukee Journal Sentinel columnist,
applauded the Brewers' management shake-up earlier in the week.</TE>
<TE>   He was especially pleased to see the last of team president Wendy
Selig-Prieb, daughter of baseball Commissioner Bud Selig. Wrote
Wolfley:</TE>
<TE>   "Whoever made the decision, however they came to make their
decision, whether it was forged in a crucible of panic or hatched in
the shade of calm reason, the Milwaukee Brewers have restored a
quality that has been missing in the franchise for more than a
decade:</TE>
<TE>   Hope."</TE>

<HD>No. 4 Florida State Is Upset by Louisville</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Henry Miller ran 25 yards for a touchdown on the second play of
overtime Thursday night as Louisville upset No. 4-ranked Florida
State, 26-20, in a steady downpour at Louisville, Ky.</LD>
<LD>   "They were better than we were," said Seminole Coach Bobby Bowden,
who was denied his 328th victory. "Before the season, I was very
concerned about this game because they were playing as good as
anybody last season."</LD>
<LD>   Anthony Floyd intercepted a pass by Chris Rix near the goal line a
play earlier to set up Miller's run.</LD>
<TE>   Florida State (4-1) was playing its first overtime game and lost
to an unranked team for the second time in two seasons. North
Carolina State defeated the Seminoles, 34-28, last year.</TE>
<TE>   "It's kind of like playing golf--you come to the last hole even
and then you hit your drive out of bounds," Bowden said.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the crowd of 38,109, soaked by the remnants of Tropical
Storm Isidore, spilled onto the field after Miller's run and tore
down the goal posts.</TE>
<TE>   "To have these guys come to our house was big," Louisville Coach
John L. Smith said. "To beat them was even bigger."</TE>
<TE>   Dave Ragone's one-yard touchdown pass to Damien Dorsey tied it at
20-20 for Louisville (3-2) with 11:37 left. Neither team threatened
to score again in the fourth quarter.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Kansas Coach Mark Mangino told the Kansas City Star he was being a
"responsible father" when he screamed at officials during his son's
high school game last week. Witnesses said Mangino became upset when
his son Tommy, Lawrence's starting quarterback, was knocked out of
the game by what he thought was a late hit. Mangino reportedly cursed
and pointed at officials in a tirade that continued until they left
the field.</TE>
<TE>   Washington State quarterback Jason Gesser, recovering from a
dislocated rib, practiced and is expected to play against
California.... Marshall's leading receiver, Josh Davis, had surgery
on his right knee and could be out at least two weeks.... Arkansas
State's leading receiver, Mike Cox, is out for at least four weeks
after breaking a foot in practice.... Eli Roberson, who came off the
bench to lead Kansas State past USC, was named the Wildcats' starting
quarterback.... Pete Zook, the father of Florida Coach Ron Zook, died
of liver and lung cancer. He was 75.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>DALLAS AT ST. LOUIS</LD>
<LD>   Kickoff: Sunday, 10 a.m.</LD>
<LD>   TV: Channel 11</LD>
<TE>   The line: St. Louis by 11 1/2</TE>
<TE>   Quick slant: Another must-win game against the Cowboys for the
Rams. Only this time in September.</TE>
<TE>   Plot: There is one word to describe the Rams, 0-3 with their backs
scraping the wall on the last weekend of September: lucky. Lucky they
are in the new NFC West, where they have to chase down only the 2-1
49ers, instead of the old NFC West, where they would already be three
games behind the Saints and Panthers. Lucky that Marshall Faulk's
neck injury turned out to be less serious than feared; he should play
Sunday. Lucky they have this chance to salvage their season--a home
game against the Cowboys--before next week's road adventure against
San Francisco.</TE>

<TE>   CHICAGO AT BUFFALO</TE>
<TE>   Kickoff: Sunday, 10 a.m.</TE>
<TE>   The line: Buffalo by 3</TE>
<TE>   Quick slant: The one that got away, one week after the one that
got away.</TE>
<TE>   Plot: Drew Bledsoe should have been quarterbacking the Bears by
now. When it became obvious the Patriots were casting their lot with
Tom Brady, Chicago was cited as Bledsoe's most likely next place of
employment. But the Bears, dazzled by their freakish 13-3 finish of a
year ago, convinced themselves they really could reach the Super Bowl
with Jim Miller--which explains why Bledsoe now starts for Buffalo,
why Chicago blew a 20-point lead at home last week to New Orleans and
why the Bills, 3-13 last season, are favored by a field goal over the
last champions of the NFC Central division.</TE>
<TE>   Monday's headline: "Passed-Over Bledsoe Passes for Over 400 Again"</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   NEW ORLEANS AT DETROIT</TE>
<TE>   Kickoff: Sunday, 10 a.m.</TE>
<TE>   The line: New Orleans by 7 1/2</TE>
<TE>   Quick slant: M&amp;M, melting before our very eyes.</TE>
<TE>   Plot: In 2001, the Lions made a run for the record book before
stumbling into a victory after 12 consecutive losses. A year later,
their story is one for the textbook, which from this day forward will
forever read: Never try to rebuild by pairing a rookie coach with a
rookie general manager. William Ford took that ill-conceived plunge
with Marty Mornhinweg and Matt Millen, one plunge leading directly to
another. The M&amp;M regime is 2-17, going on 2-18 and over and out. The
end is in sight, especially if the 3-0 Saints leave new Ford Field
the kind of shambles everyone fully expects.</TE>
<TE>   Monday's headline: "Matt to Marty: 'No, After You, I Insist' "</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   MIAMI AT KANSAS CITY</TE>
<TE>   Kickoff: Sunday, 10 a.m.</TE>
<TE>   TV: Channel 2</TE>
<TE>   The line: Miami by 3</TE>
<TE>   Quick slant: Bride, Priest meet again.</TE>
<TE>   Plot: Long before Ricky Williams wore a wedding gown on the cover
of ESPN magazine (Chapter 487 in "Dark Days in Saint History"), he
and Priest Holmes were teammates at the University of Texas. How
Williams and Holmes got where they are today--1-2 among NFL rushing
leaders--is a book in itself. Williams, having worn out his welcome
in New Orleans in three years, has hit the turf running in Miami like
no one before him. Holmes, deemed undersized surplus in Baltimore, is
now an icon in Kansas City, bidding for his second NFL rushing title
in as many years.</TE>
<TE>   Monday's headline: "Holmes Comes Up Short in Longhorn Roundup"</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   CAROLINA AT GREEN BAY</TE>
<TE>   Kickoff: Sunday, 10 a.m.</TE>
<TE>   The line: Green Bay by 7</TE>
<TE>   Quick slant: The gig is up.</TE>
<TE>   Plot: Somewhere over Wisconsin airspace, it will dawn on the
Panthers, recently voted most likely to go from 3-0 to 6-10, and they
will arrive in Green Bay realizing they are undefeated this late in
the season only by a fluke of the schedule, that three victories
scratched out at the expense of three winless opponents don't amount
to much when Brett Favre is in the pocket and Lambeau Field is
rocking and the Packers need an easy victory after three consecutive
nervous breakdowns and the only thing breaking down Sunday is the
house of cards masquerading as the Great Carolina Turnaround of 2002.</TE>
<TE>   Monday's headline: "Panthers Lose; Planet Remains on Axis"</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   CLEVELAND AT PITTSBURGH</TE>
<TE>   Kickoff: Sunday, 10 a.m.</TE>
<TE>   The line: Pittsburgh by 6</TE>
<TE>   Quick slant: The 100th renewal of the glorious rivalry. Or the
seventh.</TE>
<TE>   Plot: Don't believe everything you read, especially if it's
printed in the "NFL Record and Fact Book," where it suggests that
Sunday's game at Heinz Field is the 100th meeting between these
teams, with the Browns leading the series, 54-44. Not quite. These
Browns, the current Browns, were formed in 1999 and have played the
Steelers a total of six times, as opposed to the original Browns, who
played 93 games against the Steelers before relocating to Baltimore
and renaming themselves the Ravens. These are the kind of shenanigans
that get the NFL into trouble, and retrials of lawsuits filed by Al
Davis.</TE>
<TE>   Monday's headline: "Different Browns, Same Old Story"</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   NEW YORK JETS AT JACKSONVILLE</TE>
<TE>   Kickoff: Sunday, 10 a.m.</TE>
<TE>   The line: Jacksonville by 3 1/2</TE>
<TE>   Quick slant: So what's up with Paul Hackett?</TE>
<TE>   Plot: For the record, Hackett did not e-mail USC its game plan for
the Kansas State game. Trojan fans had to be wondering, considering
the current state of the Jets. Hackett, once reported to be an
offensive mastermind or something, now holds the title of Jet
offensive coordinator, coordinating an offense that has totaled 629
yards in three games--an average of less than 210 yards a game, worse
than every other NFL franchise except the new one in Houston. Result:
Jets outscored, 74-10, in their last two games and are underdogs in
this one--to a Jacksonville team that is 14-20 since the end of the
1999 season.</TE>
<TE>   Monday's headline: "Testaverde Can't Hackett; Can Pennington?"</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   HOUSTON AT PHILADELPHIA</TE>
<TE>   Kickoff: Sunday, 10 a.m.</TE>
<TE>   The line: Philadelphia by 20</TE>
<TE>   Quick slant: Yes, Philadelphia by 20.</TE>
<TE>   Plot: Point spreads of 20 points or more are common in college
football, but quite rare in the NFL, unless (a) the visiting team is
last in the league in total offense; (b) the visiting team couldn't
score more than a field goal against either San Diego or
Indianapolis; (c) the visiting team is still waiting to score its
second touchdown--in its history; (d) the visiting team is on pace to
yield a single-season record of 101 sacks, which would obliterate the
old record of 72, which the home team set in 1986; (e) the home team
has scored 24, 37 and 44 points in its last three games, rolling
head-on toward the half-century mark.</TE>

<TE>   NEW YORK GIANTS AT ARIZONA</TE>
<TE>   Kickoff: Sunday, 1 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   The line: New York by 3</TE>
<TE>   Quick slant: Now, how to get some rats' behinds in those seats?</TE>
<TE>   Plot: Last Sunday, a small band of Arizona Cardinal die-hards
could be heard booing quarterback Jake Plummer during the home team's
23-15 loss to San Diego. Asked about it afterward, Plummer snapped,
"I could give a rat's [behind]." This offended many in Arizona, where
the rats have had more winning seasons than the Cardinals. By
Wednesday, Plummer was holding a news conference to apologize: "When
I said that I don't give a rat's [behind] ... I meant the boos, not
the fans. I appreciate every fan that's cheered for me and will
continue to cheer for me." And he does. All 47 of them.</TE>

<TE>   TAMPA BAY AT CINCINNATI</TE>
<TE>   Kickoff: Sunday, 1 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   The line: Tampa Bay by 7</TE>
<TE>   Quick slant: Bengals throw in the towel. Also known as Akili
Smith.</TE>
<TE>   Plot: The Bengals are so bad--0-3 for the third time in four
years, having been outscored, 84-16, by San Diego, Cleveland and
Atlanta--that they've given up trying to hide it. On the team's Web
site, owner Mike Brown opines, "It has gotten to the point where
'Bungles' alliterates with 'Bengals.' " It has gotten to the point
where Bengal Coach Dick LeBeau, who needed 2.25 games to discover Gus
Frerotte wasn't the answer, has decided to send in Smith, a move
usually followed shortly thereafter by sending out resumes. Smith
admitted he was "a little bit shocked" by the move. Wait till Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   Monday's headline: "Bengals Drop to LeBeau-and-4"</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   NEW ENGLAND AT SAN DIEGO</TE>
<TE>   Kickoff: Sunday, 1:15 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   The line: New England by 3</TE>
<TE>   Quick slant: Big Big Ten showdown bigger now.</TE>
<TE>   Plot: Tom Brady and Drew Brees meet again--and how time has flown
since 1999, when Brady's Michigan Wolverines defeated Brees' Purdue
Boilermakers, 38-12, behind Brady's two touchdown passes. Over the
next three years, Brady became the starting quarterback for the most
improbable Super Bowl winner since Joe Namath's Jets, and Brees took
over a Charger offense that lost 26 of its previous 32 games. Today,
Brady and Brees are both 3-0, which is big news coast to coast,
although Brady enters this one with clearly the better supporting
cast, same as it always was back in the Big Ten.</TE>
<TE>   Monday's headline: "It's 1999 All Over Again"</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   TENNESSEE AT OAKLAND</TE>
<TE>   Kickoff: Sunday, 1:15 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   TV: Channel 2</TE>
<TE>   The line: Oakland by 6 1/2</TE>
<TE>   Quick slant: It was a very different world eight years ago.</TE>
<TE>   Plot: Eight years have passed since the then-Los Angeles Raiders
defeated the then-Houston Oilers, 17-14, at the Coliseum. Since then,
the Oilers moved to Tennessee and became the Titans, the Raiders
moved to Oakland, the Titans went to the Super Bowl, the Raiders went
to court ... and the Raiders have yet to win another game in this
series. It's Tennessee 3, Oakland 0, including last December's 13-10
decision, assisted by three botched field goals by Sebastian
Janikowski. With Eddie George limping and the Titan defense blowing
14-point fourth-quarter leads, it shouldn't be that close Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   Monday's headline: "This Time, Raiders Move to 3-0"</TE>

<TE>   MINNESOTA AT SEATTLE</TE>
<TE>   Kickoff: Sunday, 5:30 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   TV: ESPN</TE>
<TE>   The line: Seattle by 3</TE>
<TE>   Quick slant: Randy Moss hits the road. Uh oh.</TE>
<TE>   Plot: One week after cursing its luck over a Sunday night matchup
between 0-2 Atlanta and 0-2 Cincinnati, ESPN gets dumped with this
dog: 0-3 Minnesota at 0-3 Seattle. Good thing for ESPN Moss gets up
for these nationally televised games like no one else. Moss' unique
take on the bump and run--using the front of his car to push a
traffic officer halfway down the block--earned him a night in jail
along with two misdemeanor charges and gave ESPN a story line to
flesh out with expert analysis and graphic illustration, a way to
keep viewers interested amid the missed tackles and overthrown
passes.</TE>

bare-cupboard Ravens are four quarters away from 0-3. Omens Dept.:
Denver has opened 3-0 seven times previously, reaching the Super Bowl
in five of those seasons--including twice with Sharpe in 1997 and
1998. Baltimore still working on winning a game when Chris Redman

<HD>Fairplex Provides Refuge From Fire</HD>

<AU>BILL CHRISTINE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The result of a mating between a quarter horse and an appaloosa,
"Dusty" might be the oldest horse ever seen at Fairplex Park in
Pomona.</LD>
<LD>   Although the 30-year-old mixed breed is temporarily occupying one
of the 1,306 stalls during the Los Angeles County Fair meet, Dusty
has never seen Fairplex. Dusty can't see; inoperable cataracts on
both eyes have left him that way for years.</LD>
<LD>   "You wouldn't have been able to tell it," said Gail Calva,
Fairplex's stable superintendent, in talking about the blind horse.
"He got off that van the other day like nobody's business."</LD>
<TE>   Dusty, who never raced, was one of about 90 pleasure horses that
were shipped in this week from two equestrian centers in the
imperiled San Dimas Canyon. Dozens of cabins in the canyon were
destroyed by a fire that had spread to 34,000 acres by late Thursday
in the Pomona and San Gabriel valleys.</TE>
<TE>   Briefly Tuesday, about midway through the afternoon's racing card,
the smoke and soot that accompanied the fire threatened the
completion of the program.</TE>
<TE>   "We were concerned, and we had our eyes on it," said Will Meyers,
one of the Fairplex stewards. "The winds were blowing west for about
an hour. We checked with [Joan Hurley, the state veterinarian] to
make sure it was safe for the horses. Then the wind shifted, to the
east, and we were out of danger."</TE>
<TE>   There was more smoke and ash at Santa Anita, the Arcadia track
where horses are preparing for the opening of the Oak Tree meet
Wednesday. Many trainers backed off morning workouts until Thursday,
when conditions were better. Because of brush fires in nearby
Altadena, Santa Anita canceled a day of racing in 1993, in the week
before the track hosted the prestigious Breeders' Cup races.</TE>
<TE>   Trainer Jenine Sahadi, who is flying Delta Form, her Del Mar
Handicap winner, to New York for Sunday's $750,000 Turf Classic at
Belmont Park, was anxious to squeeze in the 6-year-old gelding's
final workout at Santa Anita on Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   "We got to do what we wanted," Sahadi said. "But earlier in the
week it was sooty and hazy and there was the strong smell of smoke. I
usually don't work my horses on Lasix, but today I gave it to all of
them."</TE>
<TE>   Lasix is a diuretic many horses receive before they race.</TE>
<TE>   As for Dusty, who was transported to Fairplex from the Sycamore
Canyon Equestrian Center in San Dimas, he was disoriented when led
into his stall.</TE>
<TE>   "He got stress colic," said Bill Lackey, who co-owns the horse
with Lester Tucker and rides Dusty about three times a week. "He was
pacing in his stall, and sweating a lot. You can understand that. The
people and the horses he's usually around weren't there."</TE>
<TE>   Calva said that Fairplex had about 160 vacant stalls for the
17-day meet that ends Sunday. This became a two-edged sword: The
racing department could have used extra horses to better fill its
races (sometimes as many as 13 a day), but it was a godsend that
Fairplex had the room when the Los Angeles Society for the Prevention
of Cruelty to Animals called. Before the red tape could be handled,
Lauree Adair, co-owner of the Sycamore facility with her husband,
Danny, said that many of their horses--thoroughbreds, quarter horses,
appaloosas, paints and Arabians--were evacuated to other places,
including Cal Poly Pomona, the Industry Hills Equestrian Center and
Rancho San Dimas. There were 146 head in all.</TE>
<TE>   "You should have seen what went on out there," said Lackey,
talking about the emergency evacuation at Sycamore. "They moved out
every horse at the ranch in about an hour."</TE>
<TE>   At Fairplex, Calva said that many of the regularly based
thoroughbred trainers welcomed the new horses.</TE>
<TE>   "I've got three empty stalls," trainer Cliff Sise said. "Put
anybody in there that you want to."</TE>
<TE>   Three feed companies--Angels, Citrus and Feedplex--donated food
for the distressed horses.</TE>
<TE>   "Everybody pitched in," Calva said. "We got the blind horse a fly
mask. Before I knew it, I had more than 100 water buckets and feed
tubs. The owners of those horses were very grateful."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Flawlessly, voted champion female on grass in 1992-93, died
Thursday and was buried at Elmwood Farm near Versailles, Ky. The
14-year-old mare, who had a troubled, unsuccessful breeding career,
had been treated recently for a kidney disorder.</TE>
<TE>   Flawlessly--bred and owned by Louis and Patrice Wolfson, who had
raced Affirmed, her Triple Crown-winning sire--was sent to California
and trainer Charlie Whittingham in the summer of 1991.</TE>
<TE>   In New York, where the bleeders' medication Lasix was then
prohibited, Flawlessly ran mostly on dirt and won only three of eight
starts. For Whittingham, she won 13 of 20 stakes starts, including
eight Grade I races, and had earned $2.5 million upon her retirement
in 1994.</TE>

<LD>Michelle Kwan will resume competition in the Campbell's International
Figure Skating Classic on Oct. 5 at Daytona Beach, Fla., under the
guidance of a new coach, former professional skater Scott Williams.</LD>
<LD>   She said Thursday she had worked with Williams the last two weeks
but that she had not made a lasting commitment.</LD>
<LD>   "We'll just see how it goes," said Kwan, who ended a decade-long
relationship with Frank Carroll a year ago. "It would be foolish for
me to say it will be long term when I don't know how he is at
competitions or how it will work out."</LD>
<TE>   The Daytona event, in which skaters will perform free-skate
programs, also features Salt Lake City gold medalist Sarah Hughes and
men's medalists Alexei Yagudin and Evgeni Plushenko of Russia and Tim
Goebel of the U.S., who trains in El Segundo. Irina Slutskaya of
Russia, the Olympic silver medalist and world champion, withdrew
because of an unspecified illness.</TE>
<TE>   Kwan, a Torrance native who lives in the South Bay, has been
pondering her competitive future since she finished third at Salt
Lake City, her second successive Olympic disappointment. She has not
committed to any other events this season.</TE>

<HD>Schumacher-Fangio Winner Is Up for Debate</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SHAV GLICK</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When Juan Manuel Fangio won his fifth world Formula One championship
in 1957, it was thought to be a record impossible to equal. Sort of
like Lou Gehrig's consecutive-games record.</LD>
<LD>   Michael Schumacher reached No. 5 this year and, with Ferrari
behind him, the German driver shows no signs of slowing down.</LD>
<LD>   Immediately, the question popped up, "Is Schumacher better than
Fangio?"</LD>
<TE>   The answer? Apparently, there is none.</TE>
<TE>   "You can talk about it, you can put values on their
accomplishments, but no matter how you try, comparisons don't do
justice to either one," said Phil Hill, America's first Formula One
champion and a contemporary of Fangio's.</TE>
<TE>   "Fangio was incredible in that he was able to show his superiority
by winning with different teams [Mercedes, Maserati, Lancia and
Ferrari]. Schumacher, on the other hand, has been seven seasons with
the same team [Ferrari], something that would have been impossible in
Fangio's day. The fact that Schumacher has done that is incredible in
itself."</TE>
<TE>   Dan Gurney, who drove parts of 10 seasons in F1 and reveres "the
Maestro," as the Argentine was known, says what makes the comparison
so difficult is that the consequences are so different.</TE>
<TE>   "My friend Tony Brooks, who raced for years against Fangio, said,
'It's like comparing the performance of a tight-rope walker in a
circus using the mandatory safety net with one whose act involves
balancing on a wire strung across a deep gorge.' That's about it."</TE>
<TE>   Fangio, asked in his later years the difference between his era
and the 1990s, said that he had lost 33 friends in his last nine
years of driving.</TE>
<TE>   Fangio himself might have given the best answer to differences in
eras:</TE>
<TE>   "I lived in the last epoch of romantic car building, made up of
improvisation rather than calculus, intuition rather than formula."</TE>
<TE>   In some quarters, Schumacher's achievements have been played down
because he has the financial clout of Ferrari behind him, which makes
his success more machine than man.</TE>
<TE>   Gurney totally disagrees.</TE>
<TE>   "Ferrari had not won a driver's championship in [16 years, since
Jody Scheckter in 1979] when Schumacher got there and it was five
years before he won. He was the one who built the team, hand-picking
crewmen and helping design the car and the electronics. It is
Schumacher's package."</TE>
<TE>   Before joining Ferrari in 1996, Schumacher won world championships
with Benetton in 1994 and 1995.</TE>
<TE>   One of his first moves was to take technical director Ross Brawn
and aerodynamicist Rory Byrne along with him from Benetton.</TE>
<TE>   Schumacher, who will try for his 11th victory of the season in the
U.S. Grand Prix in Indianapolis this weekend, lives in a high-tech
world and that's the way he likes it.</TE>
<TE>   "People ask me if I would prefer the cars of 10 years ago because
they were less sophisticated and didn't have the electronics and
technical advances we have today," he told Racer magazine earlier
this year. "The answer is definitely not. The more precisely I can
drive, the more I enjoy myself. I hate to take compromises with a
racing car.</TE>
<TE>   "The more standard a car is, the more compromises you have to
take; but the developments we have now bring it closer to perfection,
which is what I want."</TE>
<TE>   One more thing: Fangio was 40 when he won his first F1 title in
1951. Schumacher is only 33 and has won five titles.</TE>
<TE>   Motorcycles</TE>
<TE>   The Motocross des Nations, the world's most prestigious motocross
event, was scheduled for this weekend at Competition Park, an obscure
site on the Soboba Indian Reservation near San Jacinto. When the
event was announced a few months ago, motorcycle fans were shocked
that such a famous event could be awarded to such a little known
facility.</TE>
<TE>   Not surprisingly, the event was been canceled.</TE>
<TE>   "There is no bigger race in the world than the Motocross of
Nations, yet at the moment there is no bigger joke," said Cycle News.</TE>
<TE>   Four-time world champion Joel Smets of Belgium and teams from 27
nations, among them the U.S. trio of Ricky Carmichael, Tim Ferry and
Mike LaRocco, were scheduled to ride.</TE>
<TE>   Billy Hamill of Monrovia won his third AMA national speedway
championship by winning the third and final round last Friday at
Auburn, Calif. Greg Hancock, of Balboa Island, who had led after two
rounds, was unable to ride because of a bronchial infection....
Seven-time supercross champion Jeremy McGrath may miss the U.S. Open
of Supercross in Las Vegas on Oct. 11-12 after dislocating his hip in
a crash while practicing on the KTM test track in Corona. McGrath has
switched from Yamaha to KTM for the coming season.</TE>
<TE>   Ventura Raceway</TE>
<TE>   Rumors that the beachside track on the Ventura County Fairgrounds
is about to close are premature, says track promoter Jim Naylor.</TE>
<TE>   "We will definitely conclude the current season with the Wagsdash
on Oct. 26," he said. "The fair board is discussing some overall
changes for next year, but we plan to be back racing when the season
opens in March."</TE>
<TE>   Unlimited Hydroplanes</TE>
<TE>   Gary Garbrecht, president of Hydro-Prop, which owns the Unlimited
Hydroplane series, said after Sunday's final event in San Diego that
the transition year of 2002 had been more successful than he had
anticipated.</TE>
<TE>   "We need more races, that's for sure, but the ones we had were
good spectator events and that's what we're all about," he said.
"We're getting there. We will have two more races next year, in
Owensboro, Ky., and Lakeland, Fla. "I'd like to get up to 12 by 2005,
but we don't want to get so many we price some of our sponsors out."</TE>
<TE>   Last Laps</TE>
<TE>   Late model stock car drivers Todd Burns of Riverside and Tim
Huddleston of Agoura Hills will decide the Irwindale Speedway track
championship Saturday night. Burns leads, 756-722. Although Rip
Michels of Mission Hills has already clinched the super late model
series, he will be seeking additional glory--and money--in the
$10,000 Miller Lite Big 10 contest. Michels has a tenuous lead over
Tony Bruncati of Glendora.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier Saturday, on Irwindale's eighth-mile drag strip, Los
Angeles area police officers will compete against a team of TV
entertainers at 10:30 a.m. Acting L.A. Police Chief Martin Pomeroy is
scheduled to race, as are actors William Baldwin, Daryl Hannah, Alan
Thicke, Kelly Perine and William Lee Scott. The public is invited.</TE>
<TE>   Figure 8s will be featured at both Perris Auto Speedway and Orange
Show Speedway on Saturday night. At Perris, Michael Hughes will
attempt to jump a 6,500-pound limousine into a stack of 500 tires....
The Racers of Balboa Stadium held their 24th reunion in El Cajon last
Saturday, honoring midget car drivers from the 1930s to 1960s.
Because there are so few old-timers left, organizers said it was the
final one.</TE>
<TE>   Brown &amp; Williamson, whose Kool brand of cigarettes has been a
major motor racing sponsor since 1996, announced it will end its
sponsorship program at the end of the year. Kool colors have been on
Team Green CART cars driven by Paul Tracy and Dario Franchitti.</TE>
<TE>   Formula One won't be the only racing show in Indianapolis this
week. Tonight, a few miles west of the speedway, Laguna Beach
publisher-entrepreneur Steve Lewis will present the Indianapolis Twin
25s, a pair of Monza-style midget races that have attracted the best
drivers in the country.</TE>
<TE>   Southern Californians did not fare well in the SCCA Valvoline
Runoffs, failing to win a single event. Bill Hagerty of San Diego
appeared to have won in Showroom Stock C, but inspections
disqualified his Honda Civic Si and the victory was given to Joel
Lipperini of Pittston, Pa. Larry Hansen, of Eureka, driving a GT-3
car built by Eureka High students, finished second in his class.</TE>

<LD>Those six New York Yankee scouts who had been following the Angels
through the agony of a collar-tightening trip that was 2-7 before
Thursday must have been wondering if they were wasting time and
money. After all, the Boss will have to cough up about $55 million
next year in increased revenue sharing and luxury tax toll under the
new bargaining agreement.</LD>
<LD>   Every dollar is important now, and maybe they were tracking the
wrong team. Maybe they should have stayed in Seattle.</LD>
<LD>   Well, the Angels finally put the doubts to rest Thursday--their
own, perhaps, and those of the Yankee analysts.</LD>
<TE>   With a 10-5 victory over the Texas Rangers, the Angels finally
showered in the champagne that has been on ice for almost a week,
finally staggered past the last of the relentless ghosts and finally
qualified for their first playoff appearance in 16 years.</TE>
<TE>   Now, of course, they face a challenge as daunting as any of those
demons: a wild-card engagement with the playoff-tested Yankees,
winners of four of the last six World Series and back with a team
possibly deeper in pitching and as formidable on offense as any
predecessor during this run of October domination.</TE>
<TE>   Can the Angels regroup and refocus, putting the trauma of the trip
behind them during this final Anaheim weekend before heading to New
York on Sunday night?</TE>
<TE>   Can they ultimately beat Roger Clemens, whose 27-8 career record
reflects more wins against them than any other team and seems certain
to pitch the Tuesday night opener at Yankee Stadium, where he has a
19-2 career record?</TE>
<TE>   Can they control most-valuable-player candidate Alfonso Soriano at
the top of a lineup that includes five players with 20 or more home
runs and five with 90 or more runs batted in and that, while leading
the American League in runs and ranking second in home runs,
maintains a characteristic discipline reflected by league-leading
totals for walks and on-base percentage?</TE>
<TE>   Can they beat left-handers David Wells, who is 18-7 and 9-2 since
the All-Star break, and Andy Pettitte, who came back from
early-season elbow problems to go 10-2 since the break (including two
August wins against the Angels) and ranks third in postseason wins?</TE>
<TE>   Well, anyone looking to Vegas for answers is likely to conclude
they can't do any of that, but who would have believed that the 75-87
Angels of last year would even be playing in October of this year,
let alone shadowing the Yankees for the best record in the league?</TE>
<TE>   Of course, the Angels of the last week didn't exactly blast the
cork off the champagne. But in an immediate response to the
aforementioned questions, it can be pointed out that the Angels lead
the league in team batting and pitching, have baseball's best record
(30-15) against left-handers, restricted Soriano to a .231 average
and .286 on-base percentage in seven regular-season games and will
oppose Clemens (providing he starts the opener) with left-hander
Jarrod Washburn, who has continued to show his toughness in a season
of 18 wins, including a 2-1 August victory over the Yankees in
Anaheim.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels had only begun drying off (and drying out?) from the
champagne when an American League scout tabbed Washburn as the
probable key for Anaheim in a five-game series in which the Yankees
host Games 1, 2 and 5.</TE>
<TE>   Few teams can survive a Yankee Stadium playoff without a quality
left-hander to counter the shallow dimensions in right field and the
left-handed power of the Yankee lineup, the scout said, and the
confident Washburn has a 2.93 career earned-run average in four
starts against the Yankees and a 1.85 ERA over his last 35 innings of
this season, including one start on three days' rest and another
coming off a police investigation for alleged sexual assault.</TE>
<TE>   As a left-hander, he forces switch-hitters Bernie Williams and
Jorge Posada to swing from the right side, where they have
considerably less power, and provides a potential impediment to Jason
Giambi, who has hit only nine of his 40 home runs off left-handers,
and Robin Ventura, who has hit only eight of 27 off left-handers.</TE>
<TE>   "If Washburn continues to pitch like the ace he is, I think the
Angels have a legitimate chance," the scout said. "Let's face it,
until recently they had been having one of those years where they've
played well, and just about every blooper and dunk has fallen in.</TE>
<TE>   "It's one of those years like the Dodgers had in '88, except the
Angels are far better, and I can't say enough good things about Mike
Scioscia."</TE>
<TE>   Characteristically, the Angels also have played the Yankees tough.</TE>
<TE>   They won last year's season series, 4-3, before losing this
year's, 4-3, and they are one of only two teams (Seattle the other)
to have a winning record (35-34) against the Yankees during Joe
Torre's tenure as manager.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, none of those games were in the postseason, none in the
madhouse that is Yankee Stadium in October.</TE>
<TE>   "Say what you want," the scout said, "there's no place more
intimidating than Yankee Stadium for a night game in the fall.</TE>
<TE>   "It's intimidating even for us scouts."</TE>
<TE>   The Angels may not fear to tread in the Bronx, but only
three--Kevin Appier, Aaron Sele and Dennis Cook--have postseason
experience, and only Appier will be on the roster for the Yankee
series.</TE>
<TE>   Is that a concern, given the Yankees' familiarity with the playoff
microscope?</TE>
<TE>   Well, even spinmeister Scioscia acknowledges that the playoffs
represent a new season and there isn't a lot he and his
playoff-tested coaching staff can say or do to prepare the Angels for
the challenge.</TE>
<TE>   "As much as we try to point them in the right direction," the
manager said, "as often as we tell them how important it is to stay
consistent and have fun with it, they're really at a point now where
they've got to go out and experience it for themselves."</TE>
<TE>   Amid the tabloid frenzy of the playoffs, the issue of postseason
experience is likely to produce considerable coverage, but there are
issues on both sides that seem more important--some more obvious than
others.</TE>
<TE>   If, for instance, the left-handed Washburn is pivotal to the
Angels' success, so is the inconsistent Scott Schoeneweis, who will
be the only left-hander coming out of the bullpen in spot situations.</TE>
<TE>   If the switch-hitting Scott Spiezio, whose .364 emergence from the
right side was a key factor behind the 30-15 record against
left-handers, is potentially pivotal to the Angels' chances against
Wells and Pettitte, the awakening Brad Fullmer, .381 over the last 10
games, is similarly important against the right-handed Clemens and
Mike Mussina, who will be reluctant to pitch to the left-handed
Garret Anderson.</TE>
<TE>   If Ramon Ortiz, who gave up only one run in the seven innings of
an Aug. 21 start in the Bronx, must avoid adding to his major league
leading total for homers allowed while facing a team second in the
league homers, rookie John Lackey must demonstrate the consistency
and composure that marked his initial starts if he goes in Game 4.</TE>
<TE>   As the Angels mull all of that and more, it can be construed as a
measure of the disparity in experience, depth and payrolls--the
Yankees being at $135 million and the Angels at $60 million--that
there are only two basic issues facing Torre.</TE>
<TE>   * Whom does he start in left field--underachieving Rondell White,
hamstring-plagued Shane Spencer or rookie Juan Rivera?</TE>
<TE>   * Can closer Mariano Rivera, recently back from two stints on the
disabled list for shoulder tendinitis, pitch with the regularity
required in the playoffs?</TE>
<TE>   Torre has vowed not to use Rivera more than one inning at a time,
and it is not as if he doesn't have options.</TE>
<TE>   Steve Karsay, Mike Stanton and Ramiro Mendoza did the job with
Rivera out, and now Jeff Weaver and Orlando Hernandez will be joining
them for the division series.</TE>
<TE>   It's an impressive cast on an intimidating stage, but then the
Angels had won 96 games before finally giving those six scouts a 97th
to write home about.</TE>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Denver Bronco quarterback Brian Griese was limping on a sprained left
ankle Thursday, the result of being tripped by his dog on some stairs
at his home Wednesday night.</LD>
<LD>   Griese's availability for Monday night's game in Baltimore was
uncertain.</LD>
<LD>   He was listed as probable on the team's injury report, but he said
his ankle was sore and still somewhat swollen.</LD>
<TE>   Coach Mike Shanahan said the injury was severe enough that X-rays
were taken to be sure there was no fracture. Griese did not
participate in Thursday's practice, the first of two major workouts
this week.</TE>
<TE>   "I was walking down the stairs and my dog came barreling down the
stairs after me and clipped me, and I kind of twisted my ankle on the
stairs," Griese said.</TE>
<TE>   On May 5, Griese tripped on a steep driveway at then-teammate
Terrell Davis' house and was knocked unconscious, bruising his face.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The St. Louis Rams will have to climb out of their 0-3 hole
without Orlando Pace. The All-Pro offensive tackle tore his left calf
muscle in practice Wednesday and will be sidelined two to three
weeks. The Rams also announced that running back Marshall Faulk was
officially cleared to play, although he said there was never a doubt.
Faulk underwent an MRI exam earlier in the day, three days after he
strained his neck, and the test showed no problems.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Randy Moss apologized to his team, family and friends, but
insisted he wasn't looking for trouble when he was arrested on
charges of pushing a traffic officer with his car. The Minnesota
Viking receiver spent a night in jail and was charged with two
misdemeanors but no felonies. Moss will start Sunday's game against
Seattle, and his agent said the team will fine him, although the
amount hasn't yet been determined.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm sorry for what I've caused and what I brought on everyone who
really cares about me or this team," Moss said during a news
conference. "I am human. I am a man. I do take care of my
responsibilities, and I stand up for my actions."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Detroit Lion running back Lamont Warren has an injured shoulder
and will miss at least Sunday's game against the New Orleans Saints.
He will be replaced by Richard Huntley, who was signed last week....
Miami Dolphin quarterback Jay Fiedler, recovering from an injured
finger on his throwing hand, returned to practice Thursday and will
play Sunday at Kansas City, Coach Dave Wannstedt said.... Atlanta
Falcon linebacker Keith Brooking was fined $5,000 by the NFL for
taking off his helmet on the field during Sunday's game against
Cincinnati.</TE>

<HD>Actions by Bid Cities Under Investigation</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ALAN ABRAHAMSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In a clear indication of how the stakes have been raised in the race
to become the U.S. candidate to stage the 2012 Summer Games, the U.S.
Olympic Committee is investigating possible rules violations
involving both San Francisco and New York.</LD>
<LD>   The USOC said Thursday it was reviewing allegations that e-mails
sent by San Francisco bid supporters to some members of the USOC
board of directors were inappropriate. It also is inquiring into
comments made by New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg last week while in
Athens, Greece, site of the 2004 Games, as well as into a Sept. 6
meeting in New York City between Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton (D-N.Y.)
and IOC member Anita DeFrantz of Los Angeles, who also serves on the
USOC board.</LD>
<LD>   USOC rules prohibit bid-related contact with board members as well
as international promotion on behalf of a city.</LD>
<TE>   Bloomberg told reporters Thursday, "We did nothing inappropriate."</TE>
<TE>   DeFrantz and a spokeswoman for Clinton echoed that sentiment, as
did Tony Winnicker, a spokesman for the San Francisco 2012 bid, who
said, "We are making every effort to insure we follow the letter and
the spirit of the rules."</TE>
<TE>   The USOC has summoned senior officials from both bids to its
Colorado Springs, Colo., headquarters for a refresher course on the
rules and to point out the obvious--in the wake of the corruption
scandal tied to Salt Lake City's winning bid for the 2002 Winter
Games, the last thing any U.S. candidate needs in the international
arena is to be dogged by a perception that it can't play by the
rules.</TE>
<TE>   The USOC will choose between New York and San Francisco on Nov. 2.
The International Olympic Committee will pick the 2012 site in 2005.
Madrid, Paris, Moscow and other cities may also vie for the 2012
Games.</TE>
<TE>   Last week, two Olympic athletes who live in Northern California
but are not affiliated with the San Francisco bid committee exchanged
e-mails with members of the USOC board. The e-mails made the rounds
and were quickly routed to USOC compliance officials.</TE>
<TE>   One of the e-mails concludes with a reminder that if San Francisco
wins, its bid projects an allocation from a proposed surplus of $5
million to each of the 28 governing bodies that oversee Summer Games
sports in the United States.</TE>
<TE>   No rule could bar a city from projecting a significant
surplus--San Francisco's is $409 million--or from wanting to further
the training of future U.S. Olympic athletes. And the $5 million
proposal is not a last-second surprise; it's included in San
Francisco's bid book.</TE>
<TE>   Critics nonetheless suggested that the e-mail could have the
effect of reducing the bid process to a straightforward equation
involving cash and votes. A board member who had seen the e-mail
described being "surprised and disturbed" by it.</TE>
<TE>   On Sept. 19, Bloomberg, in Athens for an international mayors'
meeting, toured Olympic construction sites and said, "New York is the
world's most international city, and I can think of no city, save the
birthplace of the modern Olympics, that is better suited to host the
world games. Hopefully, we will have the opportunity."</TE>
<TE>   He also said he was "working to bring the 2012 Summer Olympics to
New York."</TE>
<TE>   The next day, those comments were brought to the USOC's attention.</TE>
<TE>   On Thursday, Bloomberg told reporters in New York, "I did not take
any New York paraphernalia to distribute. I did not try to promote
the U.S. effort or New York City's effort. We did nothing
inappropriate."</TE>
<TE>   Meantime, DeFrantz rode with Clinton in the senator's limousine on
Sept. 6, the day Congress convened in Manhattan, later telling the
New York Times, "It's not a bad idea to have one of the senators from
the state making the case for the city."</TE>
<TE>   DeFrantz said Thursday, "It's nothing, and if they'd like, I'd be
glad to call Sen. [Dianne] Feinstein," the Democratic senior senator
from California. "I knew her when she was [San Francisco] mayor."</TE>
<TE>   Karen Dunn, a spokeswoman for Sen. Clinton, said the senator spoke
with DeFrantz at the request of a New York City official, adding, "We
have not been apprised of any constraints on senators when it comes
to promoting their states. We knew of nothing to prevent us from
agreeing to the city's request."</TE>

<HD>Now He's the Marked Man</HD>
<DH>College football: Oregon State's Jackson emerges from
Simonton's shadow and shines.</DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Oregon State running back Steven Jackson cut a mysterious figure when
he trotted onto the field against USC last season.</LD>
<LD>   The Trojans dissected film and prepared all week for small, quick
Ken Simonton and his backup, Patrick McCall. But in the second
quarter, along came Jackson, a burly freshman from Las Vegas who
rumbled for 119 rushing yards and also caught a touchdown pass in the
Beavers' 16-13 overtime loss.</LD>
<LD>   "He didn't show up on any of the films," Trojan middle linebacker
Mike Pollard said after the game. "We didn't realize how good he
was."</LD>
<TE>   USC's film library now features plenty of Jackson footage.</TE>
<TE>   The 6-foot-1, 227-pound sophomore is ranked seventh nationally in
rushing yardage. He is averaging 134 yards a game for the unbeaten
Beavers, who defeated Eastern Kentucky, Temple, Nevada Las Vegas and
Fresno State.</TE>
<TE>   "He's run like crazy through the people he's been playing," USC
Coach Pete Carroll said.</TE>
<TE>   USC will try to control Jackson on Saturday when the No. 18
Trojans play No. 23 Oregon State in a Pacific 10 Conference opener at
the Coliseum. Quarterback Derek Anderson and Jackson are the main
cogs in a Beaver offense producing nearly 500 yards a game.</TE>
<TE>   "It's going to be hard to focus on me," Jackson said. "All aspects
of our game are clicking and we're making big plays. Coming in, we're
on this adrenaline high."</TE>
<TE>   Oregon State Coach Dennis Erickson is trying to lead the Beavers
to their first victory over USC at the Coliseum since 1960. Last
year, Jackson almost helped his team break the 18-game losing streak
with his best performance of the season.</TE>
<TE>   Oregon State trailed, 10-3, in the third quarter before Jackson
carried the Beavers through a 96-yard drive. He gained 18 yards on
the first play and added 44 more during a drive he capped with a
four-yard touchdown reception. USC eventually won in overtime on a
four-yard run by quarterback Carson Palmer.</TE>
<TE>   Jackson finished the season as the Beavers' second-leading rusher
with 390 yards in 74 carries. He also averaged 34.3 yards for seven
kickoff returns, taking one 89 yards for a touchdown.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier this week, Erickson said Jackson benefited from the
opposition's focus on Simonton, the second leading rusher in Pac-10
history behind USC's Charles White.</TE>
<TE>   "He came in when Kenny softened them up a little bit and now he's
had to deal with being the back," Erickson said.</TE>
<TE>   Jackson did not seem to mind in the opener when he rushed for 141
yards against Eastern Kentucky. He gained 117 yards against Temple,
was limited to 51 against UNLV, then broke out with 227 yards in the
Beavers' 59-19 victory last week over Fresno State.</TE>
<TE>   "I came here because I knew I would get a chance to play early in
my career," said Jackson, who chose Oregon State over Tennessee,
Arizona State and UNLV. "I knew it would be up to me to work hard and
that's what I've done.</TE>
<TE>   "So far, so good."</TE>
<TE>   USC defensive tackle Shaun Cody likes the matchup against
Jackson's power-running style. The Trojans fared well against
Colorado's Chris Brown, but struggled at times last week against
Kansas State's smaller and more elusive Darren Sproles in a 27-20
defeat.</TE>
<TE>   "We seem to do better against the bigger guys--the little guys
give us more trouble," Cody said. "But it doesn't matter who's out
there. We have to tackle better than we did last week."</TE>

<DL>MAMMOTH LAKES</DL>
<LD>It was a sight rarely seen in the back country at this time of year:
three groups of hikers caught in a traffic jam.</LD>
<LD>   The incident occurred last Saturday on the Duck Pass trail. One
pair of hikers, traveling downhill on a narrow part of the path,
encountered a second pair heading uphill. As they stopped to talk, a
third pair came along and tried to get by. There was some foot
shuffling. Someone even grumbled.</LD>
<LD>   But after a few seconds, all of the hikers, visibly amused by what
had just happened, went their separate ways and spent the rest of the
morning strolling amid towering pines and through lush golden
meadows, totally removed, if only for a day, from the bustling world
back home.</LD>
<TE>   Out on the Duck Pass trail, or on any of the numerous hiking
routes that meander through the vast wilderness above Mammoth Lakes,
there is no real traffic to contend with.</TE>
<TE>   "In the summer, I can see that happening, but not now," said Mike
Johnson of the Mammoth Ranger Station.</TE>
<TE>   There is no smog and most notable, considering the situation in
the Angeles National Forest this week, there is no smoke or ash.
There is only thin, crisp air with which to fill your lungs and the
spectacular colors of autumn with which to fill your eyes.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a good place to get away and be by myself," said Cliff
Tedder of Azusa, a city uncomfortably close to the Southland blaze.
"It's nice to come up here and just stare at a lake and have some
lunch."</TE>
<TE>   Tedder had just passed Arrowhead and Skelton lakes en route to
Barney Lake and, ultimately, Duck Lake, a vast blue gem sparkling
under the sun at 10,482 feet. How the lake was named, Johnson said,
depends on which story you prefer. One says it was named by explorers
who found ducks frozen in the ice. Another says that during the
spring, rocks sticking from the snow on the south side of the lake
spell D-U-K, and thus the lake appears as Duk Lake on some regional
maps.</TE>
<TE>   In any event, the lake, five miles from the trailhead at Coldwater
Campground above Lake Mary, is considered by day trekkers as the
ideal place to relax and catch their breath before the journey back
down the mountain.</TE>
<TE>   The Duck Pass trail is a moderate-to-strenuous route that takes
hikers from the trailhead at 9,200 feet up a series of steep
switchbacks until reaching Arrowhead Lake, followed by a more gradual
and pleasant climb to Skelton and Barney, through meadows sporting
the spectacular colors of fall. That is followed again by a steep
climb from Barney Lake up and over a rocky ridge to Duck Lake.</TE>
<TE>   The views range from beautiful to magnificent, whether you're
gazing up at the ominously rugged slopes flanking the trail, or down
and out over a canyon sprinkled with lakes of the Mammoth Creek
drainage basin.</TE>
<TE>   In the creek connecting the lakes, hikers can occasionally spot
small brown trout ambushing insects as they land on the water or wash
downstream. Trout also inhabit the lakes and, thus, many of the
hikers carry fly rods or small spin-fishing outfits.</TE>
<TE>   At Barney Lake, before their 2 1/2-mile push to Duck Lake, Ron
Aimone of Long Beach and his cousin, Al Kleczewski of Ogelsby, Ill.,
reported seeing two deer and one fisherman but otherwise nothing but
birds on their way up the mountain.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't have anything like this back in the Midwest," Kleczewski
said, marveling at his surroundings, which included aspens and
willows that had just turned from green to yellow. When asked if they
had any food, they said they had only water. They accepted two energy
bars from another hiker and off they went.</TE>
<TE>   In all, the trip to Duck Lake and back takes three to six hours,
depending on the pace--and a leisurely pace is suggested for anyone
out to soak up the brilliance a day on the trail affords. The fall
colors are just now in bloom, the days are still mild and the crowds
on this particular trail are down to an average of only five to 10
hikers a day.</TE>
<TE>   Asked if he had any advice for prospective hikers, Johnson said
they should always carry food, water and a compass, and be prepared
for sudden changes in the weather. Other than that, he said, "You
should always remember to pause and take a breath and look around
from time to time, because a lot of people get so caught up in
watching their step that they forget to do that."</TE>
<TE>   Autumn Allure</TE>
<TE>   Fall is a favorite time for fishermen as well as hikers throughout
the region, and for many of the same reasons.</TE>
<TE>   Sierra Drifters fly-fishing guide Tom Loe, in his weekly report,
said, "This is a great time of year as the aspen trees are quickly
turning brilliant shades of yellows, oranges and reds--and the
fall-spawning trout are also taking on unbelievable colors as they
stage for [their] spawning runs.</TE>
<TE>   "Think about bringing up your favorite streamer rods and some
sink-tip lines. Spawning fish are characteristically very aggressive
at this time of year and will hit large wet flies with much
exuberance."</TE>
<TE>   Taking Stock</TE>
<TE>   Crowley Lake, rated by Loe as one of the hot spots for
fly-fishermen, has been the subject of concern among anglers recently
because of staffing problems at hatcheries, which have made fish
deliveries problematic.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike most waters, Crowley is not stocked weekly throughout the
season but in a short series of major plantings toward the end of
each season.</TE>
<TE>   So far, the lake has received its usual allotment of rainbow
trout: 135,680 Coleman-strain rainbows (up in size from 10 to a pound
to between three and six to a pound); 185,000 Eagle Lake rainbows (10
to a pound), and 70,730 Kamloop rainbows (2.8 to a pound). Brown
trout have yet to be planted.</TE>
<TE>   Said Department of Fish and Game biologist Curtis Milliron:
"Usually, all of the Coleman-strain [rainbows] come from [nearby]
Fish Springs Hatchery. However, bird predation lowered the numbers to
the point that we had to import some from other hatcheries. What this
also means is that the average size of this strain went up. This
could mean better-than-average-sized fish for next [season's]
opener."</TE>
<TE>   Sorry, Charlie</TE>
<TE>   On the Pacific Queen earlier this week, anglers enjoyed a
seven-hour stop on a school of large and voracious bluefin tuna.
Unfortunately, they lacked both the experience and tackle to get them
aboard. They boated only 19 fish averaging 65 pounds. Paul Morris,
general manager of Fisherman's Landing, suggests that those boarding
any of the San Diego-based overnight boats bring a 60-pound outfit to
go along with their much lighter albacore rigs.</TE>
<TE>   A Run for the Ages</TE>
<TE>   An albacore run that began last May is playing out much longer
than expected and showing no significant signs of letting up. In
fact, through Sunday fishermen aboard San Diego one- and 1 1/2-day
vessels had boated 119,000 albacore and should set a fleet record in
a week or two. The record haul was 122,000 in 1999. A bluefin record
has already been set. The fleet through Sunday had logged 11,434,
beating the 1998 mark of 11,090.</TE>
<TE>   Tanner `Tails</TE>
<TE>   While the San Diego fleet is still targeting albacore and bluefin,
boats running from ports farther north are hitting the Tanner Bank
and withdrawing good numbers of sizable yellowtail. Don Ashley, owner
of Pierpoint Landing in Long Beach, said that as of 1 p.m. Thursday,
the Toronado already had 50 yellowtail and 50 bluefin on its deck.
The yellowtail are averaging 20-30 pounds; the bluefin are slightly
smaller.</TE>
<TE>   Winding Up</TE>
<TE>   People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals has designated
Saturday as "Fish Amnesty Day" and asks that fishermen use this day
to take a break "to give fish a respite from the constant torment
that they suffer at the hands of people who could easily entertain
themselves without hurting any living being--at least for 24 hours."</TE>
<TE>   The group's timing is interesting. The DFG has designated Saturday
as "Free Fishing Day," one of two such days each year when no license
is required. The days, the DFG says, "are a great low-cost way to
give fishing a try."</TE>

<LD>A different Pacific 10 Conference champion each of the last seven
years makes trying to figure out what might happen this year about as
tough as figuring out Randy Moss.</LD>
<LD>   It appears, however, that maybe the scribes didn't have their
digits precisely on the Pac-10 pulse in August when they predicted
the following order of finish:</LD>
<LD>   Washington State, Washington, Oregon, USC, Oregon State, UCLA,
Stanford, Arizona, Arizona State, California.</LD>
<TE>   With six schools opening Pac-10 play this weekend--Oregon State at
USC, Stanford at Arizona State, Washington State at California--we
offer a top-to-bottom reassessment.</TE>
<TE>   1. OREGON STATE (4-0): Coach Dennis Erickson is right when he says
his team hasn't beaten anybody yet--Eastern Kentucky, Temple, Nevada
Las Vegas, Fresno State--but the beltway buzz suggests that the
Beavers, 5-6 in 2001, could be back ... big time.</TE>
<TE>   "We got walloped at Oregon State last year [49-24] so I had a
preview of what was to come," Washington Coach Rick Neuheisel said
this week. "I was surprised they were picked as low as they were."</TE>
<TE>   Oregon State has outscored four opponents, 190-49, and found out
what it needed to know about sophomore quarterback Derek Anderson,
which is that he's good. Anderson has thrown 15 touchdown passes to
eight receivers with only one interception. Saturday, against USC,
we'll see how he fares against live competition.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a huge test," Erickson said, "a lot different than any other
he's had."</TE>
<TE>   If Oregon State is going to start 5-0 for the first time since
1939, it will have to beat USC in Los Angeles for the first time
since 1960.</TE>
<TE>   2. OREGON (4-0): The Ducks' nonconference schedule also had a
lightweight look--Mississippi State, Fresno State, Idaho, Portland
State--but that's only because Michigan asked to defer this year's
game to 2007. Oregon may be the only conference school with a
legitimate shot at a Bowl Championship Series title-game run in the
Fiesta Bowl because it used last season's 11-1 finish into a No. 15
preseason ranking and has since moved to No. 9. Jason Fife is no Joey
Harrington at quarterback, but he's not bad, and tailback Onterrio
Smith has rushed for 100 yards or more in all four games.</TE>
<TE>   3. USC (2-1): The opportunity lost at Kansas State Saturday
prevented the Trojans from a top 10 national ranking but did not
totally eclipse impressive victories over Auburn and Colorado. Now
comes the answer to a key question: Does playing a tough
nonconference schedule help or hurt the Trojans as they dig into
Pac-10 play?</TE>
<TE>   4. WASHINGTON (2-1): The Huskies will improve to 3-1 after beating
Idaho Saturday but are still haunted by a season-opening loss at
Michigan--don't miss director John Sayles' new movie on the subject:
"Twelve Men Out (On the Field)."</TE>
<TE>   The Michigan debacle aside, Washington probably fields the most
talent in the league with maybe the best 1-2-3 punch on offense in
quarterback Cody Pickett, tailback Rich Alexis and receiver Reggie
Williams.</TE>
<TE>   Pickett has set a school record with three consecutive 300-yard
games and should put up at least 300 more Saturday against Idaho.</TE>
<TE>   5. WASHINGTON STATE (3-1): Our plucky preseason favorites were
going along nicely through two quarters at Ohio State on Sept. 14,
holding a 7-6 lead until the Buckeyes scored 19 second-half points in
a 25-7 victory. Washington State rebounded to beat Montana State last
week, but the Cougars open Pac-10 play at Cal with massive injuries
on the offensive line and their top two quarterbacks, Jason Gesser
and Matt Kegel, on the mend. Not exactly how you want start
conference play.</TE>
<TE>   6. UCLA (2-1): Party on, Wayne! Party on, Garth! It was heartening
to read how the Bruins, dedicated warriors all, have decided to curb
their binge drinking Thursday nights in an effort to be better rested
on game Saturdays. You just don't see that kind of sacrifice anymore.
On the field, we wouldn't trust this team with a 10-foot Cory Paus
pass.</TE>
<TE>   Saturday's 11 a.m. start at San Diego State could be a wake-up
call for UCLA; let's hope the Bruins don't sleep through it.</TE>
<TE>   7. CALIFORNIA (3-1): What a coach! What a beginning! What a
turnaround!</TE>
<TE>   What happened against Air Force?</TE>
<TE>   After a stunning 3-0 start under first-year Coach Jeff Tedford,
Cal looked more like last year's 1-10 team in a 23-21 loss to the
Falcons, dropping at least 10 passes and settling for too many field
goals, five, instead of touchdowns. It only mildly dampened one of
the nation's best comeback stories and, with Washington State ailing,
the Golden Bears could conceivably steal the Pac-10 opener at
Strawberry Canyon.</TE>
<TE>   8. STANFORD (1-1): No one's sure yet what to make of the Buddy
Teevens era, only to say the players seem to like him more than they
did taskmaster Tyrone Willingham. Teevens did not need a quarterback
controversy, but may have one now involving junior Chris Lewis and
freshman Kyle Matter. Lewis brought this on himself when he was
suspended for the opener against Boston College and Matter played
well in his place.</TE>
<TE>   9. ARIZONA STATE (3-1): The Sun Devils looked anemic in an opening
loss at Nebraska, but have averaged 40 points a game in three wins
since. The pass-catch combination of Andrew Walter to Shaun McDonald
is one of the Pac-10's best and the Sun Devils have enough talent to
pull off an upset or two.</TE>
<TE>   10. Arizona (2-1): Cheer up, this isn't like being the worst team
in the Big East. In fact, Arizona should be 3-1 after a weekend
victory over North Texas. Still, last week's dreary road effort at
Wisconsin makes us wonder if Arizona can stack up or ought to Pac-up.</TE>
<TE>   Heed, though, UCLA Coach Bob Toledo's comforting words about the
conference's strength.</TE>
<TE>   "The bottom team can beat the top team," Toledo said.</TE>

<HD>There Was Little Gentle About '99 Ryder Cup</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LISA DILLMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>There were dueling books detailing, in part, the controversial finish
of the 1999 Ryder Cup at the Country Club in Brookline, Mass.</LD>
<LD>   In "Into the Bear Pit," Europe captain Mark James charged that
Payne Stewart gave advice to a teammate, that a couple of marshals
purposely sent Andrew Coltart, who was searching for his errant golf
ball, in the wrong direction and high-fived one another after he
exceeded the time limit, and, finally, that the Americans incited the
home crowd by design.</LD>
<LD>   U.S. captain Ben Crenshaw fired back in his 2001 book, "A Feel for
the Game," disputing those allegations and adding that the Europeans
"used the tactic of slow play to the fullest extent." He also retold
his last conversation with Stewart about the "coaching." (Stewart
died in October 1999.)</LD>
<TE>   Wrote Crenshaw: "I found Payne and asked him if he had ever
coached anybody or offered advice to one of our players. He said it
was preposterous; he wouldn't do that.</TE>
<TE>   "Then he said, 'Wait a minute, I did say something to Justin
[Leonard] one time. I said, 'Get your head our of your ... ,' so if
that constitutes advice, I guess I'm guilty.' That was my last
conversation with Payne and it ended with a big laugh."</TE>
<TE>   In doing the book, Crenshaw said he wanted to get a few things off
his chest about the Ryder Cup experience and then was ready to move
on. Doing so, however, is a little more difficult, especially with
the year delay of the matches because of the terrorist attacks of
last September.</TE>
<TE>   Crenshaw, who is in his first season on the Senior PGA Tour, was
on a conference call earlier this week to promote the Napa Valley
Championship, which begins Oct. 7. With the Ryder Cup starting today
in England, the majority of the questions that came his way,
naturally, dealt with the exhausting, emotional and electric
experience of 1999.</TE>
<TE>   Question: Tiger Woods made some remarks last week about a million
reasons why winning that tournament was more important than the Ryder
Cup. Having been with him at the '99 Ryder Cup, what do you think
about his remarks?</TE>
<TE>   Answer: "I just watched the press conference a little while ago in
which he said his remarks were made in jest to a few writers. It
raised my eyebrows when I read about it.</TE>
<TE>   "It sounded a little different than the Tiger we know and he tried
to explain himself a little better this morning. He explained his
emotions during the Ryder Cup week, and it didn't sound anything at
all like he said that winning the tournament would be more important
than the Ryder Cup. It didn't sound anything at all like that.
Something got lost in the translation somewhere."</TE>
<TE>   Q: With Ryder Cup coming up, does this bring back memories of
1999?</TE>
<TE>   A: "Oh, it does. It brings back so many fond memories....
[Brookline] was a very historic site, a very poignant site personally
for me because I got interested in golf architecture and golf history
all in the same week when I played as a junior there as a
16-year-old. It was a coming together of all those emotions....</TE>
<TE>   "I could see on Friday and Saturday that I thought we were on the
brink of playing very well. I did think we were going to do very well
in the singles, as we had to. And I must confess, if we didn't start
out that last day as well as we did, the matches were over.</TE>
<TE>   "I had never seen so much inspirational play from so many people.
I think the American golf public got a chance to see raw emotion
coming out from the players and what it meant to them at that time in
their golf lives. And to have it all come together was astounding.</TE>
<TE>   "It came down to this: We just couldn't lose at Boston. There was
a lot to play for. It had been built up for months. The pressure was
sky high. The players wanted to prove themselves. Both sides did.</TE>
<TE>   "The Europeans played brilliantly the first two days, as they
often do. I don't think it will be any different this week. I think
Curtis Strange has to expect that this week. It will be close and get
down to the singles again."</TE>
<TE>   Q: Do you wish you were there?</TE>
<TE>   A: "I guess I do. I will be there in spirit. It's something that
never leaves you as a golfer. To have been a participant four
different times in four different atmospheres, the Ryder Cup is
special. It is a chance to come together as a team.</TE>
<TE>   "And you play in a different arena. It's match play; it's you
against them. You're representing your country and all that you play
professional golf for.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a culmination of all those things. It's a lot of
self-induced pressure."</TE>
<TE>   Q: Do you think there will be as much emotion this year in light
of the event having been postponed because of Sept. 11 or do you
think it won't be quite as intense?</TE>
<TE>   A: "I do not think it will be as intense. We, as players, went
through the last day in Boston and it was an electric day from start
to finish. And when Justin Leonard made that putt across the green,
it was [incredible]--no one on the planet thought he was going to
make that putt.</TE>
<TE>   "That was the kind of day it was for us and we went out of control
momentarily. Our emotions got the best of us. Those are the things we
have apologized for, and we needed to. It was pure emotion coming
out.</TE>
<TE>   "You put those things into context with what happened to our
country on Sept. 11, which threw the matches back another year. I
think we all realize how important golf and sports and other walks of
life have become.</TE>
<TE>   "I think the matches are going to be a little more somber, more
respectful, and I think that's a good thing. I think as we go about
our everyday lives, it's going to be in the back of every player's
mind this week of why the matches were postponed.</TE>
<TE>   "It will be a hard-fought match, but I think it will return to
where it was before. Really, the bottom line is that Europe and Great
Britain are our oldest friends."</TE>
<TE>   Q: Do you have any advice for Curtis Strange as captain of the
Ryder Cup team?</TE>
<TE>   A: "The only thing I have talked to Curtis about, as all captains
do. [Europe captain] Sam Torrance has lost a lot of sleep about this:
How is he going to pair his players? It drives you crazy. Those
things go through your mind, especially when you think that a few
guys are going to play together and then watch them play in practice
and you have a few doubts here and there and it torments you.</TE>
<TE>   "It will either confirm his suspicions or he may insert someone at
the last second. The anticipation that has built up is now coming out
and it will be a great relief once they get out on the course."</TE>

<HD>Ryder Cup: Where Business Is Pressure</HD>
<DH>Golf: In these matches, which will be played under intense
security, heat is on from the start.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>THOMAS BONK</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SUTTON COLDFIELD, England</DL>
<LD>After spending an extra year on the drawing board, the 34th Ryder Cup
matches roll out today, this model outfitted with wall-to-wall
security and full stereophonic pressure.</LD>
<LD>   "This is where the fun begins," said Sam Torrance, captain of the
European team.</LD>
<LD>   Of course, it remains to be seen how much fun anyone is going to
have if he's so nervous he can't swing a club. Davis Love III
remembers standing over his putt at the 18th hole that would defeat
Costantino Rocca, 1-up, in the U.S. team's 15-13 victory in 1993.</LD>
<TE>   "My hands were shaking so badly that I had to back away," Love
said. "I literally couldn't do it. I was shaking so bad that I
couldn't handle it. I was trying not to miss. And then I said, 'It's
either going to go in or not go in,' and I calmed down. I got lost in
the moment and made the putt."</TE>
<TE>   Expect similar moments to occur almost anywhere on the course for
the next three days, now that the Ryder Cup has finally arrived.
Postponed for a year because of last September's terrorist attacks,
the Ryder Cup matches are back at the Belfry for the first time since
Love's hands shook in those 1993 matches. And nine years later, the
U.S. team is in a similar situation as defending champion.</TE>
<TE>   "If we play well and play up to our potential, I feel confident,"
U.S. captain Curtis Strange said.</TE>
<TE>   While Strange and Torrance and the players from both teams try to
maintain a business-as-usual posture, there is an abundance of
evidence indicating otherwise.</TE>
<TE>   Clearly, this is not a normal golf tournament.</TE>
<TE>   Ryder Cup Ltd., which runs the event, has adopted unprecedented
security measures. Cars are not allowed within miles of the course
and fans board row after row of buses to take them from the parking
lots to the course. Once at the course, purses are searched and run
through X-ray machines. Fans pass through metal detectors while
uniformed guards, carrying semi-automatic rifles, look on.</TE>
<TE>   Cellular telephones, cameras, pagers, ladders, picnic baskets,
briefcases, portable televisions, lawn chairs, bicycles, bags,
backpacks and carry-alls larger than eight inches square are banned.</TE>
<TE>   The armed guards form a 45-person unit, and there are 24 uniformed
guards with the players, as well as undercover officers circulating
through the crowd.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a comfort, of course," Torrance said. "Unfortunately, in
this day and age, it's a necessity with such a high-class field. It
probably wouldn't be something terrorists would look at, but you do
have some high-powered people here, so they have to be looked after."</TE>
<TE>   Eight matches will be played today, beginning with four four-ball,
or better-ball, matches in the morning. Tiger Woods-Paul Azinger lead
off against Darren Clarke-Thomas Bjorn, followed by David Duval-Love
against Sergio Garcia-Lee Westwood, Scott Hoch-Jim Furyk against
Colin Montgomerie-Bernhard Langer, and Phil Mickelson-David Toms
against Padraig Harrington-Niclas Fasth.</TE>
<TE>   Strange has been busy this week reminding his team of the
importance of getting off to a quick start. In 1999 at the Country
Club at Brookline, Mass., Europe held a 6-2 lead after the first day,
including a 3 1/2-- 1/2 edge in better ball.</TE>
<TE>   The Woods-Azinger pairing was a mild surprise, because Strange had
all but guaranteed that Woods would have Mark Calcavecchia as a
partner. Strange changed his mind when Calcavecchia told him he was
more comfortable in the alternate-shot format, so expect a
Woods-Calcavecchia team in the afternoon matches.</TE>
<TE>   Woods says he is ready for the rigors of match play.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a boat race for 18 holes," he said. "That's the most
challenging thing about Ryder Cup, that you're in an 18-hole match.
And things do happen. And it's a lot of fun."</TE>
<TE>   Woods also said he's growing accustomed to the team format of a
Ryder Cup.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a completely different animal," he said. "I'm telling you,
51 weeks out of the year, you're trying to beat these guys' brains
in. And now you're together, which is different. And it's really
cool."</TE>
<TE>   Beginning today, all the players would be advised to stay cool,
because the temperature is about to be turned up, and in a hurry.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The drama regarding the WTA's season-ending championships
traditionally has had more to do with who isn't playing than who is.
Venus Williams, Monica Seles and Martina Hingis missed the event last
year in Munich for various reasons. Williams suffered from an injured
wrist, inspiring a brief WTA investigation that supported her
contention. Hingis was recovering from torn ligaments in her right
ankle, and Seles has refused to play any tournaments in Germany since
her 1993 stabbing in Hamburg.</LD>
<LD>   A year later, all three have qualified for the $3-million
championships at Staples Center Nov. 6-11. Five others have secured
singles spots--Serena Williams, Jennifer Capriati, Amelie Mauresmo of
France, Justine Henin of Belgium and Jelena Dokic of Yugoslavia.</LD>
<LD>   The race for the final eight singles berths is actually of more
interest than usual to local fans and tournament officials because of
one name: Lindsay Davenport of Laguna Beach.</LD>
<TE>   Ordinarily, Davenport would have a spot secured by now. This year
she is 20th in the race to the championships, which started with the
first tournament of 2002. (The rankings are different, based on a
rolling 52-week system.) Her status in the race might suggest
Davenport is in danger of missing the championships for the first
time since 1993, but that is slightly misleading. Only 240 points
separate the 14th spot, occupied by Anna Smashnova of Israel, and
Davenport.</TE>
<TE>   Davenport, one of the early supporters of the championships' move
from Munich to Los Angeles, has made up major ground after missing
almost the first seven months of 2002 because of knee surgery. That
stretch included three Grand Slam events, as well as Indian Wells and
Key Biscayne, Fla. In five tournaments, Davenport has reached two
finals and three semifinals.</TE>
<TE>   The importance she has placed on qualifying for the Staples event
is evident in her upcoming itinerary. After the U.S. Open, Davenport
added an event to her schedule--next week's tournament in Moscow. She
will then play the following two weeks, at Filderstadt, Germany, and
in Zurich. If she hasn't qualified by then, she intends to add one
more event, at Linz, Austria.</TE>
<TE>   Anna Watch</TE>
<TE>   Davenport's presence is important for the success of the event,
which is being played in Los Angeles for the first time. Her picture
is on the cover of the tournament brochure, along with those of
Serena and Venus Williams. Then there's the Russian with long blond
hair, pictured on the inside flap, right next to the phone number to
order ticket packages and priority seating.</TE>
<TE>   But will Anna Kournikova be on the tennis court at Staples Center?
She is 31st in the singles race. But doubles apparently serves a
purpose. If the race ended today, Kournikova and Hingis would
qualify. They are sixth in the race, despite having played only four
tournaments together in 2002.</TE>
<TE>   Facts and Figures</TE>
<TE>   The tournament begins Wednesday, Nov. 6, the day session at 12:30
and the evening session at 7. The semifinals Sunday are back-to-back,
starting at 1 p.m. The singles final will be at 6:30 p.m., televised
on ESPN and going head-to-head with "Monday Night Football." Tickets
for individual sessions go on sale Saturday, through Ticketmaster at
(213) 480-3232.</TE>
<TE>   Fund-raisers</TE>
<TE>   Billie Jean King and Friends, Honoring Joe Shapiro is Saturday,
starting with a clinic at Cal State Los Angeles and finishing with a
tribute dinner and auction at the Ritz-Carlton Huntington hotel in
Pasadena. Details: (323) 343-3080. King has hosted a fund-raiser for
the athletic department since 1998, raising more than $300,000. The
Joe Shapiro Humanitarian award will be given out for the third time.
Shapiro, who died in 1999, was the former general counsel for Walt
Disney Co. and was married to Hall of Famer Pam Shriver.</TE>
<TE>   Shriver anticipates about $120,000 will be raised this year, and
she spoke about King's involvement.</TE>
<TE>   "Obviously the school means a lot to her because it's where she
had her launch point for her professional career," she said. "She
cares about her past and how it helped her get to where she is."</TE>
<TE>   In Las Vegas on the same night, the seventh Andre Agassi gala
benefit will be held at the MGM Grand Garden Arena. Appearing, among
others, will be Sir Elton John, Dennis Miller, Carlos Santana and
Robin Williams. The previous six dinners have raised more than $18
million for charity, officials said.</TE>

<LD>Paul Sunderland knew an offer was forthcoming from the Lakers because
his agent had called the night before. So what did Sunderland do? He
went fishing.</LD>
<LD>   Sunderland is not an avid fisherman, but he and longtime KLAC
engineer/producer Frank Polak had planned the outing for some time.
Polak works Laker radio broadcasts from the KLAC studios in Los
Angeles, so he was only a voice Sunderland heard in his earpiece when
he announced 56 Laker games last season.</LD>
<LD>   Now the two were going to get to spend some quality time together.</LD>
<TE>   Sunderland was at Polak's home in Van Nuys by 5 a.m. last Friday.
They went to Pyramid Lake north of Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   "I caught only one striped bass all day," Sunderland said.</TE>
<TE>   Even though the most important decision of Sunderland's career was
about to be made, he went fishing. But that was because he had made a
commitment, not because he wanted his agent to handle everything.</TE>
<TE>   "I was very involved," he said of negotiations that led to
Tuesday's announcement that Sunderland is the Lakers' new
play-by-play announcer--and only the franchise's second since it
moved to Los Angeles from Minneapolis in 1960.</TE>
<TE>   Sunderland said things worked out very much to his liking. The
Lakers stuck with their offer of only one year, but came up on the
salary. According to sources, they went from a little over $200,000
to more than $300,000, which compares favorably to what other NBA
announcers make.</TE>
<TE>   Sunderland's agent, Martin Mandel of San Francisco, said one thing
that came through loud and clear during negotiations was that the
Lakers wanted Sunderland to be satisfied.</TE>
<TE>   Jeanie Buss, the Lakers' vice president of business operations,
said, "It was important to us that Paul feel comfortable with the
offer, and obviously he did. We wanted both parties to be happy."</TE>
<TE>   Sunderland certainly was. "This is the opportunity of a lifetime,"
he said.</TE>
<TE>   Sunderland, who grew up in Southern California and attended
Sherman Oaks Notre Dame High, called it a dream come true. But he
also said, "This was never part of any grand plan, and it's hard to
believe it has actually become a reality."</TE>
<TE>   Laker play-by-play announcer is a long way from volleyball
commentator. That was Sunderland's first job in broadcasting--in 1985
with Prime Ticket. Since then he has done about every job one can do
in sports broadcasting, from college basketball commentator to
sideline reporter to news desk anchor to pregame show host to
play-by-play announcer.</TE>
<TE>   Sunderland, 50, went to Oregon on a basketball scholarship and,
after transferring to Loyola Marymount, became a national volleyball
player of the year. He was a member of the gold medal-winning U.S.
volleyball team at the 1984 Olympics.</TE>
<TE>   Sunderland says Don Corsini, current general manager at KCAL
Channel 9 and KCBS Channel 2, and Pat McClenahan, Corsini's
right-hand man, gave him his first opportunity to try play-by-play
when those two were at what is now Fox Sports Net. And NBC Sports
chief Dick Ebersol and executive producer Tommy Roy gave him the
opportunity to do NBA play-by-play on regional NBC telecasts.</TE>
<TE>   Sunderland has worked for both Fox Sports Net and NBC in recent
years, and his Laker contract allows him to still work for those
entities, just not on the NBA.</TE>
<TE>   A Pleased Partner</TE>
<TE>   Stu Lantz, entering his 16th season as the Lakers' television and
radio commentator--and first without Chick Hearn--said he is pleased
that Sunderland will be his new partner, particularly since they had
worked those 56 games together last season when Hearn was out.</TE>
<TE>   As for Sunderland being given only a one-year contract, Lantz
thought that wasn't a big deal.</TE>
<TE>   "I'll tell you the same thing I'll tell Paul," Lantz said
Thursday. "A one-year deal means nothing if you're good at what you
do. And a 10-year contract means nothing if they don't like you."</TE>
<TE>   Lantz said he thinks (but isn't sure) that his first contract was
for one year. The Lakers say Hearn worked under one-year contracts
for more than 30 years.</TE>
<TE>   Someone else pleased with the Sunderland hiring is Hearn's widow,
Marge.</TE>
<TE>   "I think he'll do a really good job," she said. "And now that the
job is his, and he's not just filling in, he'll be able to let the
real Paul come through. I think maybe he was a little nervous last
season.</TE>
<TE>   "He certainly knows the game, and he is a very fine gentleman."</TE>
<TE>   One thing that impressed the Lakers about Sunderland was the
public's reaction to his work last season. There were no complaints,
even though Sunderland was filling in for a beloved legend.</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers' decision to continue to simulcast games on television
and radio may make things a little more difficult for Sunderland.
It's not easy calling a game for the two mediums, although Sunderland
said he enjoyed doing it last season.</TE>
<TE>   Update on Marge</TE>
<TE>   Marge Hearn said she is doing well and keeping busy. She was at a
dedication of the Chick Hearn Learning Center in the new Heart of Los
Angeles Youth building at 2701 Wilshire Blvd. Wednesday. Saturday
from 4-8 p.m. she'll be at a ceremony at the Valley Inn in Sherman
Oaks, presenting the Chick Hearn Hero of the Year award. The affair
is a benefit for local firemen and paramedics.</TE>
<TE>   Short Waves</TE>
<TE>   Kevin Calabro, the Seattle SuperSonics' play-by-play announcer,
was on the Lakers' short list of candidates, along with Fox Sports
Net's Bill Macdonald. Calabro, who has another year left on his
contract with the SuperSonics, said he was never contacted by the
Lakers, nor did he contact them. It never got to that point.... The
Clippers also made an announcing deal this week. Bill Walton will not
return as the team's television commentator because his new job with
ESPN and ABC created too many conflicts. So the Clippers made Michael
Smith their full-time television commentator and gave him a multiyear
contract.... Smith and longtime play-by-play announcer Ralph Lawler
will also do the radio broadcasts when the Clippers aren't on local
television. And it appears as though the Clippers are going to be on
local television only 25 times, all on Channel 5. The team still does
not have a deal with Fox Sports Net, and the two sides are far
apart.... The Clippers are also scheduled for 10 national TV
appearances, mostly on ESPN.</TE>
<TE>   There's enough Ryder Cup coverage on television this weekend to
make one bleary-eyed. The USA network has 10 hours of delayed
coverage today, 8 a.m.-6 p.m., and NBC has the same amount at the
same time Saturday. Sunday's coverage on NBC will be shown live
beginning at 4 a.m. ... Good move by Fox Sports Net and the Angels to
add the Wednesday and Thursday games to the television schedule.
However, if the coverage of Thursday's celebration seemed lacking, it
was because Fox Sports Net was taking the game coverage feed from Fox
Sports Net Southwest in Texas. However, there was plenty of good
locker-room coverage.... With the Angels moving to radio station KSPN
next year, after the station moves to 710 on the dial Jan. 1, there
probably will be some conflicts with the Kings toward the end of the
hockey season. Team and station officials said they will work
together to move one or the other to an ABC Radio sister station,
probably Radio Disney, which is moving to KSPN's current 1110 spot on
the dial.</TE>
<TE>   Today's Basketball Hall of Fame enshrinement ceremony, featuring
the induction of Magic Johnson, will be televised live by ESPN
Classic at 4 p.m., with ESPN airing an NBA Entertainment-produced
special Sunday at 3 p.m. CBS' Jim Nantz is being inducted as
recipient of the Curt Gowdy Media Award. Funny, no mention of Nantz
in the ESPN press releases.... In light of this week's events, ESPN
updated the Randy Moss "SportsCentury" show that was on ESPN Classic
Thursday and will re-air it today on ESPN at 5 p.m.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Winless San Diego State might suffer another loss--even before
Saturday's game against UCLA begins. Attendance could be far less
than anticipated.</LD>
<LD>   Aztec officials raised ticket prices and produced 50,000 Marshall
Faulk bobbleheads for the game at Qualcomm Stadium, believing it
would be the biggest revenue-producer of the season.</LD>
<LD>   However, ESPN2 exercised its right to move the starting time from
6 p.m. to 11 a.m. Rather than drawing a crowd of 45,000, San Diego
State is hoping to reach 30,000. The drop is expected to cost the
school $150,000 to $200,000 in ticket revenue.</LD>
<TE>   Tickets are priced between $20 and $45, about double the price of
Aztec Mountain West Conference home games.</TE>
<TE>   "UCLA is a major opponent for us, and we think it's logical to be
charging big-time college prices for a big-time opponent," said Steve
Schnall, assistant athletic director for marketing. "It's in line
with what UCLA and other schools do for their games."</TE>
<TE>   UCLA had hoped a huge contingent of Bruin followers would make the
two-hour drive. The early start might put a crimp in those plans as
well.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Walk-on Matt Chastain, a redshirt freshman from the San Diego
area, will play Saturday as a sort of homecoming.</TE>
<TE>   "Like Rudy, yeah," Coach Bob Toledo said.</TE>
<TE>   Chastain, a 5-foot-11, 200-pound linebacker from San Pasqual High,
will play on the kickoff team.</TE>
<TE>   "I tell you what, he's a fierce little competitor," Toledo said.
"He's not a big guy, but he's a good football player. He got our
scout team player of the week last week. And he's a team guy, so
we'll let him run down there on kickoffs. It's not like we're not
just putting him out there to put him out there. We think he can help
us."</TE>
<TE>   Matt Kocher, a walk-on defensive tackle who played at San Diego
Patrick Henry High, might get a chance to play late in the game.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   San Diego State's shaky running attack is even more suspect
because starting tailback James Truvillion has not practiced all week
and is doubtful because of a sprained ankle. Michael Franklin would
start in place of Truvillion, who averages 3.4 yards in 54 carries.
Franklin averages 5.1 yards in 21 carries.</TE>
<TE>   Frederick Collins, a freshman who ran for 2,367 yards and scored
31 touchdowns as a senior at Palm Springs La Quinta High, also would
play.</TE>
<TE>   Aztec senior right guard Raul Gomez won't play because of a staph
infection in his leg.</TE>
<TE>   Quarterback Adam Hall, who had thrown 205 passes in four games,
developed a sore throwing arm in each of the last two games. His
passes in practice have been curtailed, but he is expected to be
ready Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Tight end Keith Carter, who has been out because of a high ankle
sprain, will be available to play, Toledo said.</TE>

<HD>Fletcher Will Help at Receiver</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Gary Klein</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Dropped passes by receivers hurt USC last week against Kansas State.</LD>
<LD>   On Thursday, the Trojan receiving corps was hurting for healthy
bodies.</LD>
<LD>   Wide receivers Kareem Kelly and Mike Williams are at full
strength, and flanker Keary Colbert is fit enough for Saturday's
Pacific 10 Conference opener against No. 23 Oregon State.</LD>
<TE>   But Jason Mitchell, who might have a stress fracture in his back,
will not play. And Grant Mattos, who strained an abdominal muscle, is
doubtful.</TE>
<TE>   Coaches addressed the depth problem by moving junior safety Sandy
Fletcher back to offense.</TE>
<TE>   Fletcher switched from receiver to safety during training camp. He
is a regular on special teams and played as a reserve safety against
Auburn and Colorado.</TE>
<TE>   "At the end of team meeting, they said, 'We need you on offense,'
" said Fletcher, who caught two passes last season. "I'm all for
whatever it takes to win."</TE>
<TE>   Walk-on receiver Greig Carlson, who returned punts last week
against Kansas State, also might play on offense against Oregon
State.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Ryan Killeen and David Davis continued their battle to handle
field-goal and extra-point attempts with no definitive conclusion.</TE>
<TE>   Both missed 38-yard field-goal attempts during a two-minute drill
at the end of practice.</TE>
<TE>   USC Coach Pete Carroll said he would decide today who will get the
first opportunity against Oregon State.</TE>
<TE>   And though every kick in practice is recorded on tape and charted,
Carroll said data will not be the deciding factor.</TE>
<TE>   "The numbers are just to give you some information," Carroll said.
"This one is truly a gut decision.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not worried about their psyches. They're both prepared to
kick and that's the way it should be."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Sultan McCullough is likely to start, but Justin Fargas and
Malaefou MacKenzie also will play tailback against Oregon State.</TE>
<TE>   Carroll, however, said the Trojans will not necessarily continue a
rotation if one player asserts himself.</TE>
<TE>   "If somebody gets hot, we'll stay with him," Carroll said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Sunny Byrd or Brandon Hancock will probably start at fullback
because Chad Pierson has a sore ankle.... Tailback Darryl Poston
continues to nurse a sore back and will not play Saturday, Carroll
said.... Quarterback Matt Leinart got leg-whipped during a drill and
suffered a contusion.... Oregon State has not won at the Coliseum
since 1960.... Linebacker Dallas Sartz's father, Jeff, played safety
at Oregon State.</TE>

<DL>SUTTON COLDFIELD, England</DL>
<LD>Controversy, thy name is ... Tiger?</LD>
<LD>   Tiger Woods--and U.S. captain Curtis Strange--found themselves
snared in a mini-controversy, one that seems to have been cooked up
by the English media. All Woods did was show up early Thursday and
start his practice round at 6:30 a.m. instead of 9, his officially
designated time, according to printed Ryder Cup material.</LD>
<LD>   It must have been a slow news day.</LD>
<TE>   Several English journalists peppered Strange with pointed
questions in a weirdly contentious news conference, asking him just
how Woods could have disappointed fans who'd paid 40 pounds, about
$65, to see him play only to miss him in all probability because they
didn't know he was playing early.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm sorry if somebody didn't get to see Tiger play," Strange said
wearily. "But they'll get to see him play the next three days."</TE>
<TE>   Said Tony Stenson of the Mirror, "And people here have paid 40
pounds a day to watch the world's greatest players [and] for Tiger
Woods to slip out of his blanket, to wear his pajamas, to go play a
game of golf without the rest of the world seeing him, I don't think
that's fair."</TE>
<TE>   Replied Strange, "Are you asking a question or making a
statement?"</TE>
<TE>   And so on. Strange was asked 14 questions about Woods showing up
early to practice.</TE>
<TE>   "He's not breaking ranks, he is doing what he's allowed to do,"
Strange said.</TE>
<TE>   You can be sure the tabloids are going to have a field day with
this. Suggested headline: "Tiger to Fans: Wake Up!"</TE>

<HD>Angels Earn Their Wings</HD>
<DH>No drought about it, as first playoff berth in 16 years is
clinched with 10-5 win</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BILL SHAIKIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>ARLINGTON, Texas</DL>
<LD>It isn't that easy, you thought. When the Angels trotted out their
new red caps over the winter and made the obligatory reference to the
hunt for a red October, your mind wandered through 16 years of Angel
futility. The Angels had angered the baseball gods enough over time,
and here they were proclaiming the return of October baseball to
Anaheim.</LD>
<LD>   But so be it. A hardy band of Angels cast aside decades worth of
curses and jinxes and hexes Thursday, with a 10-5 victory over the
Texas Rangers that clinched the Angels' first playoff berth since
1986.</LD>
<LD>   It will indeed be a red October in Anaheim and the wild-card
Angels will open the playoffs Tuesday at Yankee Stadium.</LD>
<TE>   "It's an awesome feeling to get those demons off our back,"
pitcher Jarrod Washburn said. "Monkeys off our back? Whatever."</TE>
<TE>   The victory was sweet to the young players undaunted by the
Angels' repeated failures and sweeter still to the veterans who had
lived through them.</TE>
<TE>   Closer Troy Percival got the final out, and left fielder Garret
Anderson caught it. Anderson homered and drove in three runs, and so
did right fielder Tim Salmon. Percival and Anderson joined the Angels
in 1995, Salmon in 1992, and for the first time those lifelong Angels
can play in October rather than watch.</TE>
<TE>   "This makes everything I've ever lived for worth it," Percival
said. "This is the best feeling I've ever had."</TE>
<TE>   The Angels, relatively restrained in their on-field greetings,
erupted in celebration upon retreating to the clubhouse. Champagne
and beer flowed atop heads, a seemingly endless supply of alcoholic
shampoo. Several players sneaked up behind Ramon Ortiz, grabbed him
and dumped him into a vat of ice. Bill Stoneman, the dignified
general manager, sloshed through the room in dress slacks and
flip-flops.</TE>
<TE>   "It's everything I thought it would be," Salmon said, "but I don't
know what I'm thinking right now. I'm taking in the alcohol through
the pores of my head."</TE>
<TE>   The unbridled joy reflected the tension of the past few days. The
Angels were one victory away from a playoff berth when they left
Seattle's Safeco Field last Friday, and they were still one victory
away when they arrived at the ballpark here Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   "Every day has kind of been like Groundhog Day for us," Salmon
said.</TE>
<TE>   "The last few days had gone painfully slowly for us," Stoneman
said.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels coughed up an 11-game lead in 1995, but that took more
than a month. Suddenly, this year's Angels had coughed up four games
in four days, and the echoes of '95 were stirring.</TE>
<TE>   In the fourth inning, the Angels took their first lead in five
days. In the bottom of the inning, on the first pitch, the Rangers'
Herbert Perry hit a home run that tied the score. But the Angels
rebounded with four runs in the fifth, with Salmon hitting the single
that put the team ahead for good, and the countdown to the first road
clinching in Angel history was on.</TE>
<TE>   "We were celebrating anyway, with everything that this team has
been through and with the history of the organization," center
fielder Darin Erstad said. "Who cares when it happens or where it
happens?"</TE>
<TE>   Since the Angels last appeared in the playoffs, they have changed
logos three times, general managers four times and managers six
times. Their legendary owner, Gene Autry, died. So did Jimmie Reese,
their beloved coach.</TE>
<TE>   Their failures were practically mocked by expansion teams. The
Arizona Diamondbacks got to the playoffs in two years, the Colorado
Rockies in three. The Florida Marlins won a World Series championship
in five.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels, one strike away from the World Series in 1986 and 41
games out of first place last year, survived the worst start in
franchise history this year and emerged with the best record in team
history. A franchise that has tried everything and everyone from A
(Jim Abbott) to Z (Geoff Zahn) now has yet another chance to advance
to its first World Series, to win one for the Cowboy.</TE>
<TE>   The winning pitcher Thursday, 23-year-old John Lackey, is so young
he had dinner with his parents and grandparents Wednesday. When the
Angels crashed in 1995, Lackey was in high school.</TE>
<TE>   "There's a lot of young guys who don't know what it took to get
here the last seven years," Percival said. "Hopefully, they never
have to go through this long a time to get there again."</TE>

<HD>Surgery on Knee Will Sideline Brand</HD>
<DH>Clippers: Forward could miss all of training camp. Talks on
contract extension are put on hold.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELLIOTT TEAFORD and J.A. ADANDE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Clippers said Thursday that All-Star power forward Elton Brand,
their leading scorer and rebounder last season, underwent
arthroscopic surgery on his right knee and probably will sit out
most--if not all--of training camp.</LD>
<LD>   Orthopedic surgeon Craig Morgan of Wilmington, Del., performed a
procedure to remove torn lateral meniscus cartilage. David Falk,
Brand's Washington-based agent, selected Morgan, who has worked with
New Jersey Net Kerry Kittles, Arizona Diamondback pitcher Curt
Schilling and golfer Nancy Lopez.</LD>
<LD>   Tony Daly, the Clippers' doctor, is scheduled to announce today
how long Brand will sit out. Training camp opens Tuesday for the
Clippers at Palm Desert. Daly had not seen Brand's post-operative
imaging tests as of Thursday.</LD>
<TE>   In addition to the news of Brand's surgery, the team and Falk
confirmed that negotiations for a long-term contract extension were
halted last week and no deal will be completed before the Oct. 31
deadline.</TE>
<TE>   The Clippers also did not secure a long-term contract for center
Michael Olowokandi, who signed a one-season qualifying offer worth
$6.1 million Monday.</TE>
<TE>   "We have agreed to terminate the negotiations," Falk said. "It was
senseless to prolong it into October when it was clear we didn't have
the makings of a deal."</TE>
<TE>   Andy Roeser, Clipper vice president, said talks with Falk had been
"cordial" and the decision to end the talks was mutual.</TE>
<TE>   The Clippers were offering Brand $60 million over six seasons,
according to Falk, who was seeking at least $15 million more over the
same number of years. Brand is eligible for a so-called "max-out"
deal of $80 million over six seasons. He will become a restricted
free agent July 1.</TE>
<TE>   Of undergoing knee surgery, Brand said, "I really needed it. It's
not like we're trying to get at [the Clippers]. I'm not going to
subject myself to surgery because I'm mad at the Clippers. It wasn't
anything like that.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm very confident that once I come back, I'll be feeling better
than I was at the end of the summer."</TE>
<TE>   Four of the 18 players on the Clippers' training camp
roster--Brand, forward Lamar Odom (ankle) and guards Keyon Dooling
(ankle) and Bryant Stith (knee)--will not be fit to participate
because of injuries. Odom had the cast on his right ankle removed
Tuesday but is still using crutches and wearing a soft boot.</TE>
<TE>   The Clippers open the season Oct. 30 against the Cleveland
Cavaliers at Staples Center and could be without Brand and Odom.</TE>
<TE>   "We've got to make sure we don't rush him back," Clipper Coach
Alvin Gentry said of Brand. "We have to make sure he's ready to play.</TE>
<TE>   "Two of our best players are going to be sitting out training
camp, but there's no use crying or complaining about it."</TE>
<TE>   Brand injured his knee when he attempted to block Andre Miller's
shot during Team USA's training camp in preparation for the World
Championships last month. An MRI exam taken at the time did not
reveal any damage.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't want to leave," Brand said. "I wanted the chance to
represent the country. I guess I hurt [the knee] more."</TE>
<TE>   After Brand returned from the World Championships he continued to
work out, but still felt pain. Clipper trainer Jasen Powell told him
to stay off the knee, but it still gave Brand trouble and that is
when he made the decision to have the surgery.</TE>
<TE>   Brand, who averaged 18.2 points and 11.6 rebounds in 80 games last
season, indicated he was determined to play better than ever once he
is fit.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm going to still be team oriented," Brand said. "I'm not going
to be selfish because I know me. But when you have 11 guys with
contracts on the line, there's going to be some of that. It's
obvious.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not disappointed for me because I'm going to get what I'm
going to get. I'm going to play hard and play well."</TE>

<HD>Dodgers All Thump in Dramatic Victory</HD>
<DH>Baseball: Grissom's homer, Jordan's go-ahead single in
eighth give L.A. 6-5 win to sustain playoff hopes.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE DiGIOVANNA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Dodger heartbeat that Manager Jim Tracy described as "faint"
Wednesday night grew a little more robust Thursday night, thanks to
the resuscitative efforts of Marquis Grissom and Brian Jordan and the
adrenaline rush of another pulsating, come-from-behind victory.</LD>
<LD>   Grissom and Jordan, who keyed a ninth-inning, come-from-behind win
over Colorado Wednesday, knocked in the game-tying and winning runs
in the eighth inning Thursday, as the Dodgers kept their slim playoff
hopes alive with a stunning 6-5 victory over the San Diego Padres
before 29,613 in Dodger Stadium.</LD>
<LD>   The Dodgers have won four of their last five games--each victory
coming in their final at-bat--to move within 2 1/2 games of idle San
Francisco in the National League wild-card race with three games to
go. The Giants' magic number for clinching a playoff berth remains
two.</LD>
<TE>   San Francisco opens a three-game series tonight against Houston
and would have to travel to Atlanta for a makeup game Monday if that
result would have a bearing on the wild-card race.</TE>
<TE>   "We believe in miracles right now--we hope Houston sweeps San
Francisco, and it comes down to that Atlanta game," Jordan said.
"This team has a lot of heart.... We're going to fight to the end."</TE>
<TE>   The end seemed near with two out in the bottom of the eighth, no
one on base and the Dodgers trailing, 5-4, Thursday night. Then, like
a lightning bolt, Grissom lined the first pitch from reliever Brian
Lawrence over the wall in left-center for his 17th homer of the
season and a 5-5 tie.</TE>
<TE>   Paul Lo Duca singled to right and Shawn Green greeted left-hander
Mike Holtz with a ground-rule double to left-center, his first
extra-base hit in 13 games. San Diego Manager Bruce Bochy summoned
right-hander Brandon Villafuerte and, with first base open, opted to
pitch to Jordan, one of the major leagues' hottest hitters.</TE>
<TE>   After fouling off four two-strike pitches, Jordan grounded an
infield single to the shortstop hole, scoring Lo Duca with the
go-ahead run and giving Jordan an NL-leading 27 runs batted in this
month.</TE>
<TE>   The Padres put two on with two out in the top of the ninth, but
Eric Gagne struck out Deivi Cruz on a full-count pitch for his 52nd
save.</TE>
<TE>   "That was awesome--with all these two-out rallies, you never know
what's going to happen," Jordan said. "I just wish we could win by a
large margin so we can relax a bit. We're gonna have a heart attack
soon."</TE>
<TE>   Dodger hearts probably skipped a beat in the bottom of the sixth
when pitcher Hideo Nomo, a career .134 hitter who may have the
ugliest swing in the big leagues, an easy out who had three hits in
62 at-bats for an .048 average this season, stepped to the plate with
the score tied, 3-3, and two out.</TE>
<TE>   Padre right-hander Jake Peavy grooved a 1-and-0 fastball, Nomo
took a mighty cut and, as jaws dropped throughout Dodger Stadium, the
ball jumped off his bat and soared into the left-field bullpen for
the second home run of Nomo's career.</TE>
<TE>   The stoic Nomo, who last homered on April 28, 1998, against
Milwaukee's Jose Mercedes, didn't even crack a grin as he rounded the
bases, and he looked almost embarrassed when he was summoned out of
the dugout for a curtain call.</TE>
<TE>   "It was kind of an accident," Nomo said.</TE>
<TE>   "After Nomo hit that home run," Jordan said, "we thought anything
is possible."</TE>
<TE>   That euphoria wore off moments later, though, when Gene Kingsale
led off the seventh with a walk and took third on Nomo's wild pickoff
attempt at first. Ramon Vazquez doubled to left-center for a 4-4 tie.</TE>
<TE>   Tracy pulled Nomo in favor of left-hander Jesse Orosco, and Mark
Kotsay bunted Vazquez to third. With the infield in, Ryan Klesko
smashed a liner that nicked the glove of leaping second baseman Mark
Grudzielanek and went into right field for an RBI single and a 5-4
lead.</TE>
<TE>   But Grissom's eighth-inning homer took Nomo off the hook and kept
intact the right-hander's string of 15 starts without a loss. Nomo,
14-1 with a 3.24 earned-run average in his last 26 starts, gave up
five runs and six hits in six innings and struck out nine.</TE>
<TE>   Nomo put the Dodgers in a 2-0 hole when he gave up Kotsay's homer
in the first and Vazquez' RBI fielder's choice in the second. The
Dodgers rallied for three runs in the fourth when Lo Duca walked,
Jordan singled, Eric Karros hit an RBI single, Adrian Beltre reached
on a run-scoring error and Grudzielanek, after fouling off five
two-strike pitches, hit an RBI double to left-center.</TE>
<TE>   The Padres tied it, 3-3, when Sean Burroughs doubled with two outs
in the sixth and scored on Brian Buchanan's single, the Dodgers went
ahead on Nomo's homer, and San Diego rallied in the seventh, putting
the Dodgers in a familiar, but not-so-uncomfortable position--behind
late in the game.</TE>
<TE>   "We're at the point now where we're kind of used to this," Green
said. "In some ways, we're numb to the thought of having pressure,
because we've had it for about a month straight."</TE>
<TE>   They'd love to have it for three more days.</TE>
<TE>   Or more.</TE>

<HD>Productive Grissom Wants Full-Time Gig</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Mike DiGiovanna</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It's hard to imagine where the Dodgers would have been without
Marquis Grissom this season. Who would have filled in for Brian
Jordan when the left fielder went down with injuries? Who could have
produced more in a center-field platoon with Dave Roberts? Who would
have stepped in when Roberts got hurt last weekend?</LD>
<LD>   Grissom, 35, is the Dodgers' fourth outfielder but has been every
bit as valuable as a starter, entering Thursday night's game with a
.273 average, 16 home runs, 21 doubles and 58 runs batted in and
filling the highlight reel with several superb defensive plays.</LD>
<LD>   He's also batting .305 with runners in scoring position. His most
recent clutch efforts: a game-winning two-run single in the ninth
inning Saturday night in San Diego, a game-tying RBI double in the
ninth inning of Wednesday night's 3-2 win over Colorado and a tying
solo homer in the eighth inning Thursday night against the Padres.</LD>
<TE>   But unless the Dodgers give Grissom a starting job or guarantee
him 400-450 at-bats next season--neither is likely--Grissom, a free
agent after this season, will probably leave Los Angeles this winter.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think I'd come back for that," Grissom said, when asked
if he'd consider returning as the fourth outfielder in 2003. "Money
is not the issue. Playing every day, getting at-bats, is the issue.
If an everyday job is available, if another general manager gives me
that opportunity, I'll jump at it."</TE>
<TE>   Even if that job is with a non-contending team?</TE>
<TE>   "That doesn't matter," said Grissom, who is in the last year of a
five-year, $25-million contract. "If I'm healthy, I'll make that team
competitive."</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers don't want to spend another $5 million for Grissom
next season, and with Shawn Green entrenched in right field, Roberts
establishing himself as the leadoff batter the Dodgers have lacked
for years, and Jordan probably back in left, they can't make any
promises to Grissom about playing time.</TE>
<TE>   Grissom, who had 330 at-bats before Thursday, would consider
returning as a fourth outfielder if the Dodgers offered a two-year
contract, but that's highly unlikely, as well.</TE>
<TE>   "I would love to come back," Grissom said. "But I want to play,
too."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   A cut near the blister on the middle finger of his pitching hand
will prevent Andy Ashby from starting Saturday, and barring a trip to
the playoffs, the right-hander's season is over. Kevin Beirne will
start Saturday against the Padres.</TE>
<TE>   Ashby has been ineffective in his last four starts, giving up 20
runs in 14 1/3 innings of four losses, and he'll close with a 9-13
record and 3.91 earned-run average.</TE>
<TE>   Though it was not a spectacular season, the fact that Ashby threw
181 2/3 innings after missing most of 2001 following elbow surgery
was a plus.</TE>
<TE>   "We're very encouraged by what he's done this year," Manager Jim
Tracy said. "The expectation level for him next year is something to
get excited about."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers have contacted the agent for reliever Jesse Orosco to
express their interest in re-signing the 45-year-old left-hander for
next season, and Orosco, who was 1-2 with a 3.04 ERA in 55
appearances before Thursday, is open to the idea of playing a 23rd
big league season.</TE>
<TE>   "Retirement has gone through my mind, but I'm thinking, 'How long
can I play?' more than, 'What am I still doing here?' " Orosco said.
"The pitching part of it isn't the problem. I've stayed healthy, and
I'm doing the job. But I've been traveling for a lot of years, and my
kids are growing up. I always ask my wife, and she's been OK with it.
If she wasn't, I would reconsider."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers went past 3 million in attendance for a major
league-record 17th time and the seventh year in a row. Thursday's
attendance was 29,613, pushing the season total to 3,002,622.</TE>

<LD>Spunky Gal and Warren's Whistle, already stakes winners at the
meeting, share top weight of 118 pounds in today's $100,000 Las
Madrinas Handicap for fillies and mares.</LD>
<LD>   A full and very competitive field is set for the 1 1/16-mile race,
and a good case can be made for any number of horses.</LD>
<LD>   By virtue of the rail draw and her strong score in the E.B.
Johnston Stakes on Sept. 15, Spunky Gal may rate a slight edge.
Trained by Vladimir Cerin, she will be eyeing the hat trick, having
closed out Del Mar with a wire-to-wire win on the turf, then showing
a passing gear in the Johnston when she tracked early, then won by 1
1/4 lengths. The water gets deeper now, but she looks up to the task
under Tyler Baze.</LD>
<TE>   Warren's Whistle is a multiple stakes winner over this tight
course, including a repeat victory in the Pio Pico Stakes a week ago
for trainer Mel Stute and jockey Martin Pedroza, who is locked in a
duel with Baze for the riding crown. While this filly has earned a
good deal of her $585,000 bankroll in shorter races, she has proved
she can get the job done and should find a lively pace to stalk.</TE>
<TE>   Jockey David Flores makes a rare Fairplex visit to handle
Covincing for Darrell Vienna. It may have been two years ago, but
this mare did break her maiden over this track by an eye-catching 10
lengths and figures to be forwardly placed at a decent price.</TE>
<TE>   The picks: 1. Rover 2. Be A Winner JJ 3. Larkwood 4. Fleeting Term
5. Ruby Choise 6. In Season 7. Runaway Rubi 8. Too Excessive 9. Potus
10. Well Struck 11. Spunky Gal 12. Foxy Johnny</TE>

<LD>Paloma Valley High in Menifee opened the football season by giving up
90 points and turning the ball over 14 times in two losses, but when
the Wildcats kick off tonight at La Quinta, they'll have a 2-0 record
because of paperwork problems at Hacienda Heights Los Altos and
Corona Santiago.</LD>
<LD>   Los Altos failed to forward paperwork last spring on transfer
students and reported the oversight after a season-opening 42-21
victory.</LD>
<LD>   Santiago hadn't turned in paperwork for a 14-year-old
sophomore--who needs permission from a parent, a form signed by a
doctor and an evaluation from a coach that he's ready for varsity
competition--until this week. Santiago had beaten Garden Grove
Santiago, 49-0, and Paloma Valley, 48-15.</LD>
<TE>   "That's never happened to me before in more than 25 years of
coaching," said Craig Lind, Paloma Valley's fifth-year coach. "Two
forfeit [wins] ... I don't know what to make of that. It doesn't make
us any better."</TE>

<TE>   Owen Hanson, a senior at Los Alamitos, qualified for the ReMax
Long Drive Championships by launching a 337-yard drive in qualifying
Sunday at Haines City, Fla.</TE>
<TE>   Hanson, who played sparingly as the No. 8 golfer for Los Alamitos
last year, will compete in the long drive finals Oct. 16-19 in
Mesquite, Nev.</TE>
<TE>   "If he could tighten up the rest of his game, he'd be something,"
said Al Gragnano, who coached Hanson last season.</TE>

<DH>Scheduling: Poor air quality also leads to campus closures,
venue changes for high schools and colleges.</DH>

<BD>From staff reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The wildfire in the Angeles National Forest has forced cancellation
of sporting events, venue changes and campus closures at a number of
schools in the San Bernardino, Pomona/Walnut and San Gabriel valleys.</LD>
<LD>   For the second day in a row, the South Coast Air Quality
Management District issued a special advisory Thursday, urging people
to avoid unnecessary outdoor activities in areas affected by the
smoke.</LD>
<LD>   Brett Proctor, Alta Loma High athletic director, said all the
school's athletic events this week have been postponed except for the
football game tonight against Palmdale, which has been moved to South
El Monte High from Chaffey College.</LD>
<TE>   "We have been told that at least for the time being, everywhere
south of the 60 freeway has been deemed acceptable air quality,"
Proctor said.</TE>
<TE>   Chaffey College canceled all athletic activities this week except
for football, which practiced at Fontana Miller High. Chaffey is
still scheduled to play Saturday at San Bernardino Valley. Most other
area colleges, such as Pomona-Pitzer, Cal Poly Pomona,
Claremont-Mudd-Scripps and Mt. San Antonio, postponed athletic events
and canceled or curtailed practices.</TE>
<TE>   Officials at Glendora High were forced to move their football game
tonight against San Dimas from Citrus College to Walnut High. The
Tartans have been practicing at Hacienda Heights Los Altos High.</TE>
<TE>   The football game tonight between La Verne Bonita and visiting
Claremont has been canceled and there will be no makeup game.
Claremont Athletic Director Rich Dutton said the team moved its
practice to Brea Olinda High on Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   "As the wind changes direction, the air-quality index changes,"
Dutton said. "That's what makes it so difficult. You can't predict
how things are going to be even 24 hours in advance."</TE>
<TE>   Two Thursday football games changed sites: Ontario High's team,
which practiced this week in the school's gym, played Rowland in
Rowland Heights instead of at Montclair High. San Bernardino Cajon
and Etiwanda played at Cajon High instead of Chaffey College.</TE>
<TE>   Pasadena Muir Coach Ron Mims said his football team, which plays
L.A. Loyola tonight at Santa Monica College, hasn't had a formal
practice since Monday.</TE>
<TE>   Glendora St. Lucy's High canceled all sporting events and
practices for the week after shutting down Wednesday. The school
hopes to reopen Monday.</TE>
<TE>   Claremont Webb, which was closed Tuesday and Wednesday, is still
hoping to play its home football game Saturday against La Verne
Lutheran.</TE>
<TE>   La Verne Calvary Baptist's football game Saturday against visiting
Las Vegas Calvary Baptist has been canceled, and the Mount Baldy
League cross-country meet postponed Wednesday has been rescheduled
for Oct. 1 at Mt. San Antonio College.</TE>
<TE>   While a number of other sports also had contests canceled or
postponed, the girls' volleyball match between visiting San Dimas and
Bonita on Tuesday was rescheduled to Oct. 2 because the Bonita gym
was being used as an evacuation center.</TE>

<LD>Senior wide receiver Corey Boudreaux wrested a pass away from
defensive back Joseph Paredes for an 80-yard touchdown reception late
in the third quarter to help Santa Ana Mater Dei rally for a 16-13
victory over Riverside North at Santa Ana Stadium on Thursday night.</LD>
<LD>   Boudreaux caught the pass from sophomore quarterback Jason Forcier
at the North 38 and ran untouched into the end zone after Paredes
fell down while trying to strip the ball.</LD>
<LD>   The Monarchs, No. 17 in The Times' rankings, were coming off a
21-19 loss to Mission Viejo.</LD>
<TE>   "We both went for it up in the air," said Boudreaux, who also
intercepted a pass deep in Mater Dei territory in the first quarter.
"He tried to rip it out and I was able to twist it out."</TE>
<TE>   Running back Josh Barnett had given North (1-2), once ranked as
high as No. 9, a 13-9 lead early in the third quarter when he took a
pitch from quarterback Dion Morton and ran 21 yards for a touchdown.
Barnett also scored on an 18-yard run in the second quarter and
finished with 136 yards in 29 carries.</TE>
<TE>   Rafael Rice, who scored on a 14-yard pass from Forcier in the
second quarter, had his first 100-yard game of the season, rushing
for 106 in 23 carries.</TE>
<TE>   After Boudreaux's decisive touchdown, North moved the ball no
farther than the Mater Dei 43. North kicker Zack Romero missed
field-goal attempts of 47 and 37 yards.</TE>
<TE>   Ben Bolch</TE>

<TE>   Los Alamitos 24, Bellflower St. John Bosco 14--The Griffins broke
open a tight game by converting three turnovers into 17 second-half
points and a victory at Veterans Stadium in Long Beach.</TE>
<TE>   Defensive back Antoine Cason intercepted a long pass by St. John
Bosco quarterback Joseph Souza on the Braves' first possession of the
second half and Kevin Gamarnik kicked a 40-yard field goal on the
ensuing drive to give the Griffins a 10-7 lead.</TE>
<TE>   After Christopher Cheri recovered a Souza fumble, Los Alamitos
(2-0-1) drove 47 yards in five plays, capped by Ryan Bagley's 10-yard
run that increased the Griffins' lead to 17-7 early in the fourth
quarter.</TE>
<TE>   Linebacker Gregory Johnson intercepted two passes for Los
Alamitos. He returned one 30 yards to set up a three-yard touchdown
run by Bagley with 4:06 left. .</TE>
<TE>   Brandon Tripp caught seven passes for 85 yards and Jeremy Childs
had seven receptions for 80 yards for Los Alamitos.</TE>
<TE>   Derrick Williams rushed for 131 yards in 15 carries and had four
receptions for 40 yards for St. John Bosco (1-2). Michael Chowtham
had six receptions for 100 yards, among them a nine-yard touchdown
pass from Souza with 1:25 remaining.</TE>
<TE>   Steve Galluzzo</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Rolling Hills Estates Peninsula 28, Santa Fe Springs Santa Fe
6--Jordan Munde rushed for 204 yards in 27 carries and scored three
touchdowns for Peninsula at Whittier Pioneer High.</TE>
<TE>   Munde's best run came just before halftime on a play that was
designed to run out the clock. With 12 seconds left and Peninsula
(2-1) holding a 7-3 lead, Munde took a pitchout and turned the corner
for a 68-yard touchdown run.</TE>
<TE>   Santa Fe (2-1), the top-ranked team in Division VII, cut the lead
to 14-6 on a 31-yard field goal by Art Reyes midway through the third
quarter, but Munde carried nine times on the ensuing drive and scored
on a one-yard touchdown run early in the fourth quarter for a 21-6
lead.</TE>
<TE>   John Disbro then put the game out of reach, returning Peninsula's
third interception of the game 27 yards for a touchdown. The
Panthers, a Division III team, missed the playoffs for the first time
last season.</TE>

<HD>It's Official: Jordan Will Play Again</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Michael Jordan plans to play another season with the Washington
Wizards, confident his 39-year-old knees are sound enough to allow
him to finish his contract with the team.</LD>
<LD>   "My love for the game of basketball continues to drive my
decision," Jordan said Thursday in a statement released by the
Wizards. "Physically I am feeling very strong, and feel that the
steps I took in the off-season have allowed me to return to the game
in great condition."</LD>
<LD>   The statement lacked the drama and magnitude of Jordan's
announcement a year ago, when he ended a 3 1/2-year retirement by
resigning from the Wizards' front office so he could resume playing.</LD>
<TE>   Coach Doug Collins said he has spoken to Jordan about using him as
a sixth man at shooting guard.</TE>
<TE>   Jordan led the Wizards in scoring (22.9), assists (5.2) and steals
(1.4) last season, but he also led them in turnovers (2.7), and his
shooting percentage (41.6) was nearly nine percentage points off his
career average. He played 60 of 82 games in a season disrupted by
knee surgery.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Sassy Smith posted the sixth-best qualifying time in trials but
tonight can become only the third winner of the Pacific Coast Quarter
Horse Racing Assn.'s Breeders' Futurity to win the Breeders' Derby as
well.</LD>
<LD>   The field for the $117,000 Derby is a talented lot. Babe Watcher,
who ran second to Sassy Smith in the 2001 Breeders' Futurity, won the
Sunland Park Fall Futurity and posted the best qualifying time in the
Breeders' Derby trials. Check Him Out won the Golden State Derby last
month.</LD>
<LD>   Not so bad: Jockey Joe Badilla has been aboard mounts that have
won the last three Breeders' Derbies. He will ride Sassy Smith from
Gate 5 tonight for trainer Jaime Gomez, whose Make It Anywhere (2001
and 2002) is one of the two horses to have won the futurity and the
derby. The other was Azure Hope Too in 1985 and '86.</LD>
<TE>   The picks: 1. A Dash Of Apollo, 2. Leeper, 3. First Down Chicky,
4. Fred Too, 5. Signed Corona, 6. Metamorphosis, 7. First Royal
Princess, 8. A Cover Story, 9. Check Him Out, 10. Cagey Cameron.</TE>
<TE>   Four: Stay up late for First Royal Princess and Sixy Bee in the
seventh, A Cover Story in the eighth, Check Him Out, Babe Watcher and
Sassy Smith in the ninth, and Cagey Cameron and Mighty Smooth Dash in
the finale.</TE>
<TE>   Shots in the dark: Is the magic back for Corona Magic in the
sixth? Sassy Smith deserves better than being a longshot in the
ninth. Another looker in the talent-laden ninth is Miami Cartel
breaking on the inside rail.</TE>
<TE>   Post time: 7:15 p.m.</TE>

is going into the Hall of Fame.</LD>
<LD>   Gee, no kidding.</LD>
<LD>   This one has been on the schedule since that night in 1980 when
Kareem Abdul-Jabbar was out and Johnson jumped center in the Finals,
getting 42 points, 15 rebounds and seven assists against the 76ers
and leading the Showtime Lakers to the first of five titles.</LD>
<TE>   He was a 20-year-old rookie. Forget the old line about waiving the
five-year rule. After that, they could have waived the rest of his
career.</TE>
<TE>   Johnson says it showed him he was as good as he hoped. It settled
everyone else's doubts too, making this night inevitable, a pleasant
(yawn) formality ... except for the fact this is Magic we're talking
about.</TE>
<TE>   He's having his friend and arch-foe Larry Bird present him tonight
and gets goose pimples talking about it. Magic's family is thrilled
at the honor being bestowed upon him. Magic is thrilled. In this
life, even the inevitable is fun.</TE>
<TE>   That was the secret of his success, immense as it would be. He was
a discipline-transcending genius: at basketball, with people, most of
all in life, a never-ending joy for him that he communicated to
everyone around him.</TE>
<TE>   He wasn't perfect. He could fire a coach and dribble out the clock
in the Finals in Boston. In retirement, he lost his Teflon protection
altogether and suffered embarrassments, for revelations about his sex
life in his autobiography, for his awkward comebacks, for his brief
career as a late-night TV talk show host. Once the world couldn't get
enough of him; now he seemed overexposed.</TE>
<TE>   Yet, unsinkable he was and is. Nothing ever kept him down, not
even becoming HIV positive, which may be one reason he could surmount
the death sentence that seemed to await him.</TE>
<TE>   "When you think about it, it's not like he wasn't going to get
elected," said Memphis Grizzly General Manager Jerry West. "He knew
he was going to get elected.... [But] knowing him, he would be
terribly excited, even though he knew he was going to be in there.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a wonderful honor for one of the handful of great players
that ever played the game. And he's one of the handful. And you could
probably take one of those fingers off and he'd be one of four, five
guys that left an indelible mark on this league."</TE>
<TE>   West understands the implications of his math. He left his own
indelible mark, but it's his place that Johnson took on the mythical
all-time team.</TE>
<TE>   Once, the Dream Backcourt was West and Oscar Robertson; now it's
Magic and Michael Jordan. With Shaquille O'Neal emerging as the
game's best center, and Bird, there's your five fingers, minus one.</TE>
<TE>   All are/were not merely great, but transcendent, and none more
than Johnson, who was such a brilliant point guard at his impossible
height of 6 feet 9, he rendered the old concept of "position"
meaningless, while additionally suffusing every team he was on with
his will and enthusiasm, even when he was 20 and the guys he was
ordering around were way older.</TE>
<TE>   He came, he saw, he took over. No one could resist, even if
veterans like Abdul-Jabbar and Jamaal Wilkes flipped out at the overt
favoritism--like a $25-million "lifetime contract"--lavished on
Johnson by the new owner, Jerry Buss.</TE>
<TE>   Norm Nixon, the incumbent point guard who'd had to give up the
ball, had famously mixed feelings, leading to a blowup in the first
round of the '81 playoffs--a shocking loss to Houston, the last game
ending after Magic, who was supposed to throw the ball to Kareem,
drove into the lane and put up an airball.</TE>
<TE>   Nevertheless, Nixon and Johnson also were tight, with Michael
Cooper as Third Musketeer. They were so close that when Nixon was
traded for Byron Scott, the remaining musketeers beat up Scott in
practice for a week or two before finding out he could take it and
becoming best friends with him too.</TE>
<TE>   "There was a uniqueness about that whole [first] year and that
started in the summer pro league," said Michael Cooper, who broke in
alongside Johnson in 1980.</TE>
<TE>   "They were playing that summer pro league at Cal State L.A. And
all of a sudden they said, 'Hey, Magic's going to come play with us
on a Friday night.' ... They opened up the top [deck]. And that had
never been open the whole summer.</TE>
<TE>   "And you could see the magicalness of it all. The place was full,
it was hot. I remember that game so well. That was the time when we
got our first Coop-a-Loop. We went over the top and I got a dunk. You
could tell there was going to be something special, not only that
young man but what he was bringing to the game of basketball....</TE>
<TE>   "We're in our first game and Kareem hits that [game-winning] sky
hook down in San Diego and Magic is wrapped around his neck. He's
jumping up and down like we've just won a championship. And I know
everybody has heard this, Kareem says, 'Hey, what you doing guy, we
still got 81 more games to play.'</TE>
<TE>   "That's the way Magic approached it. Every game was fun. And in
turn, when the players are having fun, the fans are having fun. He
brings them out on the court, even though they can't physically be
out there....</TE>
<TE>   "He made them part of Laker Showtime and I think that was the
specialness and uniqueness about Magic Johnson. It's very rare that a
player can do that, to get everybody excited about playing."</TE>
<TE>   Johnson had size and strength, although he wasn't high on the
running/jumping scale. But no one could match his package: the court
sense, the wizardry, the poise, the charisma, the will.</TE>
<TE>   "He was unique in almost every way, OK?" West said. "I've said,
I've seen guys have size advantages--and the Lakers have one now in
Shaquille--but he probably had the greatest size advantage playing
his position of anyone I've ever seen....</TE>
<TE>   "He just had such a confidence about his ability to make other
people better, to make 'em play hard.... He started every season with
an incredible optimism. More importantly, he started every season an
improved player, 'cause he worked so hard on his game in the
off-season.</TE>
<TE>   "When I look back at him, my God, what a treat for the city of Los
Angeles."</TE>
<TE>   When Johnson left the scene so suddenly in 1991, a numb West
noted: "I think somewhere out there, there's a young little kid
who'll be as great as Magic Johnson as a player. But he won't be as
great as a leader."</TE>
<TE>   Sure enough, no one has come close as a leader.</TE>
<TE>   In Johnson's time, the All-Star game was more than the mandatory,
desultory exhibition it has become, because Magic would always be
woofing about winning, which would, in turn, fire up Isiah Thomas and
their pals on the East team--and then, of course, there was Bird's
mouth--so that the guys actually competed.</TE>
<TE>   In Johnson's time, U.S. pro teams didn't get carried out of
international competitions feet first, as this summer's did in
Indianapolis. Nor did they go down to the wire with Lithuania and
France, as our 2000 Olympic gold medalists did.</TE>
<TE>   Johnson's 1992 team, the only real Dream Team, was the greatest
collection of players ever put together (Magic, Jordan, Bird, David
Robinson, Patrick Ewing, Charles Barkley, Karl Malone, John Stockton,
Scottie Pippen, Chris Mullin, etc.), but they didn't get full of
themselves (well, aside from Barkley) or yawn their way through it.
They blew away all opponents. In between, they went after each other
as their coaches marveled at the pre-tournament scrimmages in Monte
Carlo, which some called the highest-level basketball ever played.</TE>
<TE>   Johnson was 33 and officially retired but his personality still
towered above everyone's, even Jordan's. No player has so dominated
any of the other U.S. teams, nor have any of those teams played as
hard, or as well, or looked as if they were having any fun at all.</TE>
<TE>   Careers were planned around Johnson. Pat Riley used to say he'd
leave when Johnson did (although Magic has been gone a long time and
Riley is still coaching). In the fall of '92, when Magic was planning
his first comeback, my boss asked if I'd like to become the national
NBA writer. I asked to stay on the Laker beat, because it was so much
fun being around Johnson.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, when Magic called it off during the exhibition season,
I went scurrying back to the boss to see if that national job was
still open.</TE>
<TE>   It was a transitional period all around but it ended happily, as
all Johnson's other periods had. Now he's a business magnate, into
movie houses, hamburger stands and soft-drink distributorships, still
looking for an NBA team he can run as his very own. Once he tried to
buy into the expansion Raptors. Last spring, he talked to SuperSonic
owner Howard Schultz. Sooner or later something figures to work out
for him because something always does.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't feel ill," he said last week. "I never have. I still work
out every day like I normally do. Everything has been super since Day
1. I just had my physical last week and [the doctor] said, 'Man,
whatever you're doing, just keep it up.' I passed all the tests
again. To me, everything is wonderful. Life is wonderful."</TE>
<TE>   His life always has been. Now that you're an all-time great,
officially, here's a formal thank-you, for the laughs even more than
the thrills.</TE>

<LD>UCLA forward Andre Patterson received his summer school grades
Thursday, but the school has not determined whether he made enough
progress to keep alive his hopes of being eligible after the fall
quarter. A decision is expected today.</LD>
<LD>   Patterson, a sophomore, is ineligible for the fall. However, he
could gain eligibility in time to face Kansas in the fifth game of
the season, Dec. 21, provided he made enough progress in summer
school and posts good grades this fall at Santa Monica City College.</LD>
<LD>   The loss of Patterson would further deplete a Bruin roster that
lost highly touted freshman forward Evan Burns two weeks ago and
transfer guard Brian Morrison on Wednesday.</LD>
<TE>   Burns transferred to San Diego State as a partial qualifier after
the NCAA ruled that several classes he took at Fairfax High did not
count as "core" courses. Morrison, a transfer from North Carolina,
withdrew Wednesday.</TE>

<LD>The departure of Paul Pressler, the Disney executive who oversaw the
Mighty Ducks and Angels for Disney, will have little effect on the
day-to-day hockey operations, team officials said.</LD>
<LD>   What may directly affect the Ducks was the hiring of a New York
investment bank to actively search for a buyer for Disney's sports
franchises. Hockey sources said that Disney has dropped its asking
price for the Ducks and might entertain offers similar to the $101
million that the Florida Panthers were sold for in 2001.</LD>
<LD>   Three years ago, Disney was asking $150 million for the team. The
franchise cost the company $50 million in 1993. Disney officials
declined to comment on the possible sale of the Ducks or the Angels.</LD>
<TE>   Pressler, who left to become chief executive of the Gap retail
clothing company, was less hands-on than his predecessor, Tony
Tavares. He set up both teams with a general manager and business
executive, who reported directly to Pressler.</TE>
<TE>   Bryan Murray was moved in as the Ducks' general manager and Doug
Moss was hired as vice president for business operations. Duck
officials credited Pressler with backing their efforts to revive the
woeful franchise. Bill Stoneman handled the baseball operations for
the Angels, while Kevin Uhlich ran the business side.</TE>
<TE>   Pressler, who was also in charge of Disney's theme parks and
resorts, informed Duck and Angel officials of his resignation
Wednesday night.</TE>
<TE>   A replacement for Pressler is expected to be announced within a
few days.</TE>
<TE>   "I hope it doesn't affect us at all," Murray said. "Paul was
awfully good to work with in the short time I worked with him. He
allowed me to do what has happened, the renovation [of the training
facility], and the staffing and player changes. The indications I
have is we keep going."</TE>
<TE>   Chris Foster</TE>

<TE>   Before Erik Rasmussen was chosen by the Buffalo Sabres with the
seventh pick overall in the 1996 NHL draft, King General Manager Dave
Taylor considered him a potential superstar.</TE>
<TE>   That's not how it worked out in Buffalo, but when Taylor got the
chance to trade for Rasmussen two months ago, he didn't hesitate,
sending little-used Adam Mair and a 2003 draft pick to the Sabres for
the 6-foot-2, 207-pound left wing.</TE>
<TE>   "It seems to me, and to our scouting staff, that there's a little
more offensive upside, a little more potential in him," Taylor said
Thursday before the Kings' 3-2 exhibition victory over the Phoenix
Coyotes in front of 14,352 at Staples Center. "He's only 25 years old
and he skates well for his size."</TE>
<TE>   In the best of his five seasons with the Sabres, Rasmussen scored
31 points, among them 12 goals. Last season, he had 19 points in 69
games.</TE>
<TE>   "He's bigger and stronger than Adam, but is he as competitive?"
Coach Andy Murray said. "Does he work as hard? Those things are yet
to be determined."</TE>

<HD>Johnson Wins 24th for Diamondbacks</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Randy Johnson pitched a six-hitter for his major league-leading 24th
victory, and the Arizona Diamondbacks ended a losing streak at six by
defeating the Colorado Rockies, 4-2, Thursday night at Phoenix.</LD>
<LD>   Matt Williams tripled in three runs as the Diamondbacks (95-64)
reduced their magic number to win the National League West to two.
Arizona, which already has clinched a playoff berth, leads San
Francisco (92-66) by 2 1/2 games.</LD>
<LD>   Arizona outfielder Quinton McCracken had to be helped from the
field after he fouled a ball off his left foot for the second time in
the game in the seventh inning.</LD>
<TE>   Johnson (24-5) struck out eight to finish the regular season with
334. He has led the majors in strikeouts each of his four seasons
with Arizona. His season strikeout total is the 10th highest in major
league history.</TE>
<TE>   Johnson pulled ahead of teammate Curt Schilling (23-7) for the
most victories in the majors. Johnson's previous career-best was 21
victories last year.</TE>
<TE>   St. Louis 9, Milwaukee 1--J.D. Drew homered for the third
consecutive game and Matt Morris rebounded from two shaky starts,
leading the Cardinals over the Brewers at St. Louis.</TE>
<TE>   The NL Central champions won their fifth in a row to stay ahead of
Arizona in the race for home-field advantage in the first round of
the playoffs. Morris (17-9) allowed six hits and a run in seven
innings.</TE>
<TE>   On the brink of tying the major league record for strikeouts in a
season, Milwaukee's Jose Hernandez was held out of the lineup.
Hernandez has struck out 188 times this season, one shy of the mark
set by Bobby Bonds in 1970.</TE>
<TE>   Cincinnati 1, Chicago 0--Danny Graves became the latest pitcher to
contain Sammy Sosa, allowing four hits over six innings in the Reds'
victory at Chicago. Sosa, who needs two homers to become the first
player to reach 50 in five seasons, went one for four with a
strikeout and two groundouts. He hasn't homered in 22 plate
appearances since Friday and has five homers in the last 22 games.</TE>
<TE>   Montreal 4, Florida 3--Jamey Carroll singled home the go-ahead run
in the sixth inning to lift the Expos at Montreal. Vladimir Guerrero
had a single in four at-bats to remain one home run short of becoming
the fourth player in major league history with 40 homers and 40
steals in the same season.</TE>
<TE>   Atlanta at Philadelphia--The game between the Braves and Phillies
was canceled because of rain and will not be made up. The Braves
(98-58) already have clinched home-field advantage throughout the NL
playoffs.</TE>
<TE>   New York at Pittsburgh--The game between the Mets and Pirates was
canceled because of rain and will not be made up.</TE>

<LD>He wasn't there.</LD>
<LD>   When his children spilled joyfully onto a field in Texas on
Thursday, Bob Fontaine Jr. was sitting in an office in Chicago.</LD>
<LD>   While the Angels were cutting the ribbon on a long-awaited playoff
home, Fontaine was busy building the Chicago White Sox.</LD>
<TE>   He wasn't there.</TE>
<TE>   But he was there.</TE>
<TE>   He was there on a weed-choked Dominican Republic field with a
skinny kid named Ramon Ortiz.</TE>
<TE>   He was there in Riverside with a strong-armed catcher named Troy
Percival.</TE>
<TE>   He was there when Darin Erstad was punting footballs in Nebraska,
and Jarrod Washburn was throwing snowballs in Wisconsin, and Troy
Glaus was playing shortstop in Westwood.</TE>
<TE>   He was there when the Southland's trendy baseball heroes were only
a collection of wings and prayers.</TE>
<TE>   Bob Fontaine Jr. turned them into Angels.</TE>
<TE>   And then, after 13 years as their scouting boss, he was gone.</TE>
<TE>   Three years ago, rather than face a Disney purge of his
department, he followed Bill Bavasi out the door like a good soldier,
walked away without publicity or complaint.</TE>
<TE>   Took with him one of the best bird-dogging minds of this era.</TE>
<TE>   Left behind a potential champion.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps today is a good time for somebody to notice.</TE>
<TE>   "Oh, no," Fontaine said when contacted, after much difficulty, for
this story. "I don't really want to do this. This is not my time.
This is the Angels' time. I am so happy for them. This is their
story."</TE>
<TE>   Oh, yes, but their stories are intertwined, those of the
home-grown Angels and the scouting guru who planted them.</TE>
<TE>   This is a story of how Fontaine assembled the core of the current
Angels with such scouts as Tim Kelly, Tom Burns, Ted Brzenk, Rick
Ingalls, Kris Kline, Tom Osowski, George Ortiz, Jose Gomez, Darrell
Miller and Tom Kotchman. Only Kotchman and Burns are still with the
organization.</TE>
<TE>   But their work will be held up during this postseason as an
example of how an old-fashioned game can still be conquered with
old-fashioned work.</TE>
<TE>   Five of the Angels' eight regular position players were drafted or
initially signed by the organization. Another player, second baseman
Adam Kennedy, was acquired in a trade for home-grown Jim Edmonds.</TE>
<TE>   Three of the four pitchers in the postseason rotation are Angel
products. And, of course, closer Percival has never played anywhere
else.</TE>
<TE>   All 10 of them--every last arm and bat--were acquired and approved
by Bob Fontaine Jr.</TE>
<TE>   A guy who doesn't use a radar gun or stopwatch. A guy who doesn't
take notes. A guy who spends entire at-bats focusing only on a
hitter's feet.</TE>
<TE>   A guy who slept on park benches, stood in swamps, and once scouted
12 games in one day in search of the players who will face the
Yankees next week.</TE>
<TE>   A guy who will enjoy the fruits of none of it.</TE>
<TE>   Fontaine, 49, is now the minor league boss of the White Sox.
Instead of watching the Angels in New York next week, he will be
watching kids in Arizona.</TE>
<TE>   "I will say this: His record was amazing," said Bavasi, who runs
the Dodgers' farm system and was also reluctant to talk for fear of
stealing attention from the Angels. "I defy you to find another
scouting director who has produced the kind of players Bobby has
produced."</TE>
<TE>   And I defy you to find anyone outside the game who will notice.</TE>
<TE>   That's how it works with scouts. They spend their lives under a
sunscreen coat and a Panama hat.</TE>
<TE>   They speak in numbers, they communicate in glances, they live in
small type at the bottom of a player's biography that nobody reads.</TE>
<TE>   Like so many dirty-smocked chefs, scouts sweat over the cooking,
then hand over their masterpiece for the enjoyment of someone else.</TE>
<TE>   Sometimes somebody will come back into the kitchen to thank them.</TE>
<TE>   Mostly, they won't.</TE>
<TE>   To look at the Angels is to realize that somebody needs thanking.</TE>
<TE>   "Yeah, you need to thank Bill Stoneman and Mike Scioscia for
turning them into a winner," Fontaine said.</TE>
<TE>   But before 2002, there was 1995.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels had the first overall pick, which, in the uncertain
world of baseball, often means disappointment.</TE>
<TE>   In the first round, Fontaine picked Erstad. In the second round,
Washburn.</TE>
<TE>   That same summer, with virtually no Latin American budget,
Fontaine waded into makeshift field in the Dominican Republic and
approved the signing of Ortiz.</TE>
<TE>   "A pretty fortunate year," he said. "Erstad was easy. Jarrod had
that good, loose arm. Ramon, I loved his wrists."</TE>
<TE>   Before that, there was 1990.</TE>
<TE>   They knew of a Granada Hills kid who was a great basketball
player. They put him through a workout. They asked him to change his
throwing style.</TE>
<TE>   "He did just what we asked, and he improved on the spot, and we
thought, this kid is really smart," Fontaine said. "What he had, you
couldn't teach."</TE>
<TE>   And so, in the fourth round, they took Garret Anderson.</TE>
<TE>   They also saw a catcher with the makeup of a pitcher.</TE>
<TE>   "We thought, if he couldn't hit, we would just put him on the
mound," Fontaine said.</TE>
<TE>   So in the sixth round, they took Percival.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not one person; it never is," Fontaine said. "I was lucky to
work with a group of scouts who took no shortcuts and were not afraid
to take a chance."</TE>
<TE>   In 1989, the Angels saw a potentially great hitter who would slide
in the draft because of his funky stance.</TE>
<TE>   In the third round, Fontaine stole Tim Salmon.</TE>
<TE>   John Lackey, a former first baseman, had been pitching only a year
when the Angels grabbed him in the second round.</TE>
<TE>   Orlando Palmeiro was a tiny outfielder who had been ignored by
nearly everybody when the Angels grabbed him in the 33rd round.</TE>
<TE>   Everyone says that much of scouting is luck.</TE>
<TE>   One man overseeing the building of virtually an entire playoff
team--the first Angel playoff team in 16 years--is not luck.</TE>
<TE>   "And I wish the Angels nothing but luck," Fontaine said, excusing
himself, returning to the shadow, his work now done.</TE>

<LD>Kansas City's pack-it-in defense after taking the lead Wednesday
night was no surprise to the Galaxy.</LD>
<LD>   What was surprising was how flat the Western Conference champion
and No. 1-seeded Galaxy came out to begin the Major League Soccer
playoffs against the No. 8-seeded Wizards before pulling out a 3-2
overtime win at the Rose Bowl.</LD>
<LD>   Galaxy Coach Sigi Schmid said the quick, four-day turnaround from
regular-season finale to playoff opener contributed to the Galaxy
malaise.</LD>
<TE>   Rather than basking in the afterglow of its thrilling
home-and-home series sweep of defending league champion San Jose that
gave the Galaxy its fifth divisional title in seven years, Schmid
said his team was hurting because of it.</TE>
<TE>   "Our last two games against San Jose were not only physically
demanding games but emotionally demanding games," he said. "You can
see by San Jose losing that it obviously took something out of them
too.</TE>
<TE>   "But it's a great wake-up call because we got the win and we
didn't play our best game and now the guys know what they're in for."</TE>
<TE>   Stadium Approved</TE>
<TE>   Six years after the idea was proposed, England gave final approval
Thursday for a $1.17-billion reconstruction of Wembley Stadium.</TE>
<TE>   The 90,000-seat stadium in north London is scheduled to open in
2006, and instead of the famous "Twin Towers" that have been a
landmark since Wembley opened in 1923, the renovation will feature a
soaring, 400-foot high "Triumphal Arch."</TE>
<TE>   Critics have said the massively expensive project will become "the
first white elephant in football boots," but supporters claim it will
help England's efforts to host future World Cups and the Olympic
Games.</TE>

<HD>Renaud Hits Right Notes for Loyola</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Eric Sondheimer</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Bo Renaud is eliciting standing ovations on two stages--football and
singing.</LD>
<LD>   As Los Angeles Loyola High's senior tailback, he has rushed for
132 and 170 yards in the first two games.</LD>
<LD>   "He's having a great year so far," Coach Steve Grady said.</LD>
<TE>   As a singer, his voice is so special that friends are urging him
to join the next "American Idol" competition.</TE>
<TE>   "I'll be up all night voting for him," quarterback Adam Gonzalez
said.</TE>
<TE>   Renaud had the lead role in last spring's school production of
"Motown MacBeth." To say he made a positive impression would be an
understatement.</TE>
<TE>   "It's perhaps the most beautiful voice I've had in my 14 years of
teaching," said Walter Wolfe, Loyola's theater director. "I rarely
tell my students to pursue an avenue of theater, but my advice to Bo
is it would be a shame if people didn't hear his voice. It's got an
ease and natural beauty that people would gasp when he [sings]."</TE>
<TE>   Linebackers might gasp when seeing Renaud plow toward them at full
speed, undeterred by an impending collision.</TE>
<TE>   "He's like a big bowling ball coming at you," Gonzalez said.</TE>
<TE>   Renaud is 5 feet 8 and 190 pounds with a shaved head. Don't ask
him to choose between football and singing.</TE>
<TE>   "I love both," he said.</TE>
<TE>   He has demonstrated star quality since he was 6 and tried out for
a school talent show. He performed "Edelweiss" from "The Sound of
Music."</TE>
<TE>   At 7, he started playing tackle football in Lakewood. By 11, he
was running and training with his uncle and uncle's teammates at
Lakewood Mayfair High. He'd run with the players to a riverbed and
hear it from them when he ran too fast.</TE>
<TE>   "They were mad because they wanted me to slow the pace and used to
yell at my uncle they were going to beat him up if I didn't stop
[finishing] in front of them and making them look bad," he said.</TE>
<TE>   He wanted to play running back, but he was a lineman for many
years in youth football.</TE>
<TE>   "I always wanted the ball," he said. "Everyone told me I couldn't
because I was a lineman. I ran every day until I became fast enough.
Finally, they gave me a chance."</TE>
<TE>   Whether scoring touchdowns or singing, Renaud is at ease. From
rock to rap, from country and western to hip-hop, he'll gladly try
anything.</TE>
<TE>   "I can sing pretty high and sing pretty low," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Renaud has concluded that football and singing offer similar
challenges.</TE>
<TE>   "Being on stage is a rush and it hits you like a ton of bricks,"
he said. "You're trying to remember your lines, you get them mixed up
and forget. The challenge is you don't want to look dumb on stage.</TE>
<TE>   "In football, you're trying to find a seam and break to the hole
and think a mile a minute. If you miss a line in a show, you have to
improvise. In football, if somebody misses the block, you have to
find some way to get around it and make it work."</TE>
<TE>   If Renaud messes up in theater, he'll get a tongue lashing. But if
he does the same in football, the wrath of Grady is worse.</TE>
<TE>   Gaining a Grady compliment is his goal.</TE>
<TE>   "Lord knows I've been trying to do it for a long time," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Grady saw Renaud and fullback Chris Randle sing in "Motown
MacBeth."</TE>
<TE>   "They were fantastic," he said.</TE>
<TE>   There's the compliment, Bo.</TE>
<TE>   Still to be decided is whether Renaud pursues football or singing
in college.</TE>
<TE>   Wolfe wants him to keep singing.</TE>
<TE>   "If there's justice in the world, we'll be paying money to hear
him one day," he said.</TE>
<TE>   But Renaud isn't ready to end his football dreams.</TE>
<TE>   "I thank my stars every day that I'm extremely blessed with a lot
of gifts," he said, "and it's my duty to share what I have."</TE>

<LD>India is seeking diplomatic help from the United States to persuade
Portugal to extradite alleged terrorist mastermind Abu Salem, who was
arrested in Lisbon last week, Indian officials said. Salem, an Indian
Muslim, is a prime suspect in a deadly bomb attack in 1993 that
killed 257 people and wounded more than 1,000 in the country's
financial capital, Bombay.</LD>
<LD>   Salem was arrested in Lisbon on Sept. 18 for possessing fake
identity papers. Portugal said he would have to serve any local
sentence before he could be deported.</LD>

<LD>A coconut shell and other relics from Capt. Bligh's perilous sea
voyage after mutineers stole the Bounty were auctioned for $1.1
million. The collection included William Bligh's account of his
41-day journey with loyal seamen from Tahitian waters to Timor with
little food or water.</LD>
<LD>   The coconut shell used as a cup and bowl by Bligh's party after
Fletcher Christian and the mutineers set them adrift in 1789 sold for
$111,135. On it, Bligh had scribbled the words, "The cup I eat my
miserable allowance out of." The relics were sold by a New Zealand
couple descended from Bligh.</LD>

<LD>The daughter of former Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic was

<LD>The son-in-law and three grandsons of Myanmar's former dictator Ne
Win were sentenced to hang after a court found them guilty of
plotting to overthrow the military government. The government said
the coup plot was hatched because Ne Win's relatives were angry over
losing privileges when the 91-year-old leader was pushed out of the
country's power structure.</LD>
<LD>   Ne Win ruled for 26 years until 1988 and has been under house
arrest with his daughter since the coup plot emerged in March.</LD>

<HD>Fierce Clash Between Rebels, Russian Troops</HD>
<DH>Caucasus: Separatists battle army in republic of
Ingushetia, near Chechnya. Guerrillas, a civilian, a Briton and 14
soldiers reportedly die.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN DANISZEWSKI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>MOSCOW</DL>
<LD>About 200 Chechen rebels clashed Thursday with Russian army troops
backed by bombers and helicopter gunships in a rare large-scale
battle in Russia's three-year war with the separatists.</LD>
<LD>   A fierce firefight broke out at 5 a.m. in the village of Galashki
in the republic of Ingushetia, which borders Chechnya. Fourteen
Russian servicemen--including two crew members of a helicopter that
was shot down--and an undetermined number of Chechen fighters were
killed during the six-hour battle, Russian officials said.</LD>
<LD>   Among those also reported killed were a civilian woman and a
British freelance cameraman who had apparently been traveling with
the rebels.</LD>
<TE>   Some Russian officials said that as many as 40 rebels had been
killed, but a police officer and journalist at the scene said by
telephone that they saw only four or five bodies of slain rebels in
the streets of Galashki.</TE>
<TE>   The battle was unusual because it took place in Ingushetia, to the
west of Chechnya.</TE>
<TE>   The Chechens, thought to be led by warlord commander Ruslan
Gelayev, apparently had left the Pankisi Gorge area of Georgia
several days earlier, crossed north into Russia, and had made their
way on foot across 60 miles of forest and mountains toward Chechnya
before encountering any serious resistance from the Russian forces.</TE>
<TE>   Senior Lt. Ruslan Khashiyev, of the Sunzha district police
department of Ingushetia, said in a phone interview with The Times
that Russian forces had heard of the Chechen group's advance and had
set up an outpost to wait for them in Galashki, a village just nine
miles from the Chechen border.</TE>
<TE>   When the Russians found themselves under attack, they immediately
called for reinforcements and air support, but they were overrun by
the Chechens.</TE>
<TE>   "The rebels easily sliced through them and went into the village,"
Khashiyev said. "When two helicopters appeared in the sky, the rebels
shot one down with an antiaircraft rocket. The crew burned to death
during the crash."</TE>
<TE>   A local woman, Roza Khakiyeva, said she woke up early in the
morning and heard shots and explosions.</TE>
<TE>   "I looked out the window and saw armed men running in the street
toward the bridge. I could see an armored car drive up to the village
when suddenly it stopped, caught fire and started falling over a
cliff off the road."</TE>
<TE>   She hid in her home. "This is the first time I saw war. It was
horrible," she said. "I never thought it could come here to our
village. It is very, very scary."</TE>
<TE>   Cut off by heavy Russian fire from using a bridge over the Assa
River to flee the village, the Chechens instead forded the icy stream
and escaped, Khashiyev said. Afterward, Russian bombers dropped
explosives on the surrounding forest and police conducted
house-to-house searches.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know how many rebels they killed like this. I didn't see
their bodies," he said.</TE>
<TE>   A defense analyst, Alexander I. Zhilin, who writes for the Moscow
News weekly, said many things about the operation did not add up.</TE>
<TE>   "The biggest question is how the military dares to let a couple of
hundred of rebels into a big, densely populated village," he said.
"How come the rebels crossed our border and walked unopposed for
dozens of miles until they basically reached the border of Chechnya?"</TE>
<TE>   Zhilin said Russian officials in recent weeks have been harshly
critical of Georgia, another former Soviet state, for not taking a
tougher stance on rebels seeking sanctuary there, but he said the
same criticism could be leveled at the Russians themselves.</TE>
<TE>   "I would like the authorities to explain why the rebels were not
bombed into smithereens when they crossed the border into Russia, no
matter who helped them in Georgia," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Speaking in Warsaw on Thursday, Russian Defense Minister Sergei B.
Ivanov said the Galashki incident "well could be" the last straw in
Moscow's dealings with Georgia. "If we see that terrorists have
crossed the Russian-Georgian border or are preparing to do so, we
will not wait around for them to commit crimes," he said.</TE>
<TE>   After the battle, journalists in Galashki were shown four bodies
of people killed in the battle, one of which was believed to be that
of the British cameraman.</TE>
<TE>   Russian forces said they found the body and an accompanying
passport with the name Roderick John Scott.</TE>
<TE>   In London, Frontline Television News confirmed that a freelance
cameraman known as Roddy Scott had been in Georgia for about two
months.</TE>

<HD>Sectarian Conflict Erupts in India</HD>
<DH>Violence: Two Muslims are stabbed amid Hindu protests over
a bloody temple attack.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>AHMADABAD, India</DL>
<LD>Hindu nationalists held angry protest marches and mobs stabbed two
Muslim men in western India on Thursday as Muslims fled their homes
to seek safety, fearing revenge riots after a bloody attack on a
Hindu temple.</LD>
<LD>   Paramilitary police deployed in several towns in Gujarat state,
and officials said they were confident that they could prevent a
repetition of the sectarian violence that erupted in the state for
three months earlier this year, leaving 1,000 dead, mostly Muslims.</LD>
<LD>   Narendra Modi, Gujarat's chief minister, blamed Islamic militants
and again accused Pakistan, India's neighbor and rival, for an attack
that claimed the lives of 33 people, mostly Hindu worshippers. Modi
described the attack as a meticulously planned attempt to inflame
hatred between Hindus and Muslims.</LD>
<TE>   Hindu nationalists, who had called for a national strike to
protest the temple raid, were on the streets in the town of Baroda,
carrying sharp weapons and shouting anti-Pakistan slogans, police
said.</TE>
<TE>   The strike shut shops, schools and transportation in many parts of
the country. Police detained hundreds of activists with the World
Hindu Council as the workers tried to enforce the strike across the
country.</TE>
<TE>   Activists shouting slogans and throwing stones stopped some
passenger trains in Bombay, where most residents stayed home. Life in
major cities in Uttar Pradesh state--home to the largest number of
Indian Muslims--was paralyzed, including in Agra, site of the Taj
Mahal, where shops and offices were closed and there was no public
transport.</TE>
<TE>   In Gujarat's capital, Surat, Hindu mobs stabbed two Muslim men in
separate attacks, Police Commissioner V.K. Gupta said. He said both
men were hospitalized and two Hindus had been arrested.</TE>
<TE>   In Gandhinagar, about 150 miles north of Surat, two gunmen
attacked a Hindu temple on Tuesday and set off a 14-hour gunfight
that left 33 people dead, including the attackers. At least 76 others
were wounded in the attack.</TE>

<HD>Aircraft Ferries U.S. Kids to Ghana</HD>
<DH>Africa: Schoolchildren are among those aboard first
evacuation plane to leave Ivory Coast as countries scramble to bring
their nationals out of rebel-held city.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>YAMOUSSOUKRO, Ivory Coast</DL>
<LD>American schoolchildren flew to safety Thursday on the first
evacuation plane from rebellion-torn Ivory Coast, while French troops
launched a full-scale evacuation of frightened Westerners from the
rebel-held city of Bouake, which was under threat of government
attack.</LD>
<LD>   A U.S. C-130 carried the first 18 evacuees--students ages 8 to 18
from a mission boarding school and staff members, most of them
American--to an airport in neighboring Ghana, where U.S. Embassy
workers whisked them away to rest and start arranging reunions with
families.</LD>
<LD>   Smiling broadly, the rescued Americans clutched water bottles as
they crossed the tarmac toting bags of their belongings.</LD>
<TE>   U.S. forces armed with assault rifles had flanked the children's
military cargo plane when it left Ivory Coast--ending a week that saw
teachers and children pinned down by rebel fire that at times came
over the walls of their whitewashed school on the edge of Bouake.</TE>
<TE>   "We were hunkered down for seven days waiting for help--then the
French came," said Mike Coustineau, security chief for the
U.S.-affiliated International Christian Academy. "We were very
delighted to see them."</TE>
<TE>   The first flight out came as U.S., French and British forces
scrambled to bring all their nationals out of Bouake, a central city
of 500,000 people. In Washington, the State Department advised
Americans to leave the rebellion-torn country and authorized the
families of American diplomats and those foreign service workers
whose jobs are nonessential to depart.</TE>
<TE>   As the evacuation got underway, Ivory Coast Defense Minister Moise
Lida Kouassi took to state TV to declare Bouake and one other
rebel-held city "war zones." He said attack was imminent.</TE>
<TE>   Troops from France, the nation's former colonial ruler, hammered
out a cease-fire with rebels for the evacuation and rushed to clear
the city of all who wished to go.</TE>
<TE>   Hundreds of armed French troops in jeeps and at least one light
tank secured the main roads out of Bouake.</TE>
<TE>   Government troops secured the 40-mile route to a hastily erected
reception center in Yamoussoukro, the capital.</TE>
<TE>   French and U.S. forces and diplomats of several European countries
and Japan waited there to receive their nationals.</TE>
<TE>   Ivorians and Africans from other nations also joined the convoy.</TE>
<TE>   French forces said they expected Bouake to be emptied of all
foreigners who wanted to leave by today. The city is home to 650
French, an unknown number of other Europeans, and at least 150
Americans.</TE>
<TE>   Unable or unwilling to flee, many of Bouake's Ivory Coast citizens
huddled in their homes.</TE>
<TE>   "Everyone is afraid," said one frightened Ivorian woman, reached
by telephone Thursday. "We'd like to be helped too."</TE>

<LD>Sakie Yokota had already warned her daughter about the dark and
lonely stretch of road that wound past an abandoned hotel near their
home in northwest Japan.</LD>
<LD>   Thirteen-year-old Megumi had been late the night before. And when
she didn't get home from badminton practice by 6:30, her mother and
9-year-old twin brothers grabbed flashlights to search the
neighborhood and nearby beach. They ran back to her school to see if
she was still there. Her father dropped his mah-jongg game and
enlisted his friends to help look for the girl.</LD>
<LD>   That was on Nov. 15, 1977.</LD>
<TE>   It was the beginning of a search over the next several years that
would include 3,000 police officers, divers, boats and helicopters.
But the last trace of Megumi was found the night she disappeared.
Less than a block from her home, search dogs following her scent went
round in circles and stopped.</TE>
<TE>   The quarter-century since then has been a "living purgatory" of
despair and frustration for Megumi's parents. Last week they received
confirmation of their suspicion: North Korea admitted kidnapping her
and 11 other Japanese.</TE>
<TE>   Today the Yokotas and the families of the other victims will get a
chance to vent their anger at a meeting with Prime Minister Junichiro
Koizumi. The couple said in an interview at the suburban Tokyo
apartment where they now live that they want a comprehensive
investigation of what happened to their daughter.</TE>
<TE>   Japan has been riveted by the Yokota family's tale, particularly
since last week, when North Korean leader Kim Jong Il acknowledged in
a meeting with Koizumi that North Koreans had abducted Japanese
citizens in the 1970s and 1980s, including Megumi. The North Koreans
said she died a decade ago, reportedly leaving behind a daughter who
is now 15.</TE>
<TE>   Kim said the abductees were used to train spies in the Japanese
language who could then adopt their identities, so the North Koreans
could more easily slip into enemy South Korea.</TE>
<TE>   Victims' families have blasted the Japanese government for failing
to verify the information that North Korea provided. Japanese
officials accompanying Koizumi took no pictures of the four people
still living who North Korea says were among those kidnapped, nor
were physical characteristics of the victims solicited from their
families in Japan. Until the revelations last week, the Yokotas
hadn't ever heard directly from Japan's Foreign Ministry about their
daughter's disappearance.</TE>
<TE>   The government is now trying to get more details. A team of
diplomats will fly to Pyongyang on Saturday to press North Korea for
information and evidence.</TE>
<TE>   For the families of those who are reported to be dead, the
revelations did not provide closure. They doubt that any of the
information is true.</TE>
<TE>   "Judging life and death with such flimsy evidence is just
outrageous," says Megumi's father, Shigeru Yokota.</TE>
<TE>   The Yokotas have been told they might be able to visit North Korea
soon, but are divided about whether to go. Shigeru is keen to go as
soon as possible, but Megumi's mother, Sakie, wants to wait until she
knows more about what happened to Megumi and whether the 15-year-old
girl is really their granddaughter.</TE>
<TE>   The girl met with a Japanese diplomat in Pyongyang and told him
that she still had her mother's Yonex-brand badminton racket. The
racket has a gold shaft, and its cover still had on it part of
Megumi's name. But the teenager didn't know that her mother was
Japanese. She also did not know her mother's birthday, or where she
was buried.</TE>
<TE>   Megumi reportedly had married a North Korean man, who has since
remarried and has a 3-year-old son.</TE>
<TE>   Before the Kim-Koizumi summit last week, the only clue that Megumi
might be in North Korea had emerged five years ago, 20 years after
her disappearance.</TE>
<TE>   Her parents learned from the office of a parliament member that a
North Korean agent who defected to South Korea might have information
about their daughter. They traveled to Seoul to meet him.</TE>
<TE>   The defector told them that his instructor at a North Korean
military institute had abducted someone matching Megumi's description
in the 1970s. According to the defector, three agents were involved.
Two were walking along the beach when the girl came by, and they
abducted her in order to ensure they weren't discovered. They didn't
realize she was a child until they got her on the boat, where they
put her in a dark cargo hold for the 40-hour journey to North Korea.
She cried the entire way for her mother, and scratched the walls so
hard that her fingers bled and her fingernails cracked.</TE>
<TE>   According to the agent, the instructor was criticized by his
superiors in North Korea for abducting a child. Megumi was told that
if she learned Korean, she would be given a job and allowed to go
back home. But she fell ill, was hospitalized twice and never was
sent back.</TE>
<TE>   Sakie Yokota wrote a book in 1998 about the family's ordeal, which
has sold more than 20,000 copies.</TE>
<TE>   She recalls, "I wanted to die. It was like being killed slowly."</TE>
<TE>   In recent weeks, the Yokotas--now in their 60s--have been doing
interviews from early morning until long after dark in their small
apartment in Tokyo's Kawasaki suburb. They typically don't get to bed
before 2 a.m. Reporters camp out on the landing outside their
12th-floor apartment.</TE>
<TE>   They are the leaders of a tightly knit group of families of people
believed to have been abducted by North Koreans. Megumi was the only
child taken. Eight people, including three dating couples, were
abducted in Japan. Three others in their 20s were in Europe and were
possibly lured to North Korea with the prospect of jobs.</TE>
<TE>   Several dozen others are also suspected to have been kidnapped,
but that has not been confirmed.</TE>
<TE>   Over the last five years, the families and several support groups
collected 1.8 million signatures urging the government to rescue the
kidnapped victims. But North Korea had repeatedly denied any
abductions, even walking out of meetings where the Japanese demanded
information.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the grim news from North Korea, her parents hold out hope
that the bright, happy daughter who had a love of singing might still
be alive. They have dozens of pictures of her--in a bright red
kimono, walking with her twin brothers on a street, in a red cap with
smiling face, and a more serious one in a school uniform.</TE>
<TE>   Around one framed photo in the living room is a chain of origami
cranes sent recently by a support group. Next to the photo is a small
ceramic frog, a gift from a family friend. The word for frog in
Japanese is kaeru, which also means to return home.</TE>
<TE>   "All that's on my mind," said her mother, "is that my child comes
home safely."</TE>

<HD>Israel Targets Hamas Leader in Missile Attack That Kills 2</HD>
<DH>Mideast: Success of the strike in Gaza is unclear. The
militant group says Mohammed Deif was not harmed, but 40 people
reportedly were injured.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MITCHELL LANDSBERG</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>JERUSALEM</DL>
<LD>Israeli helicopters launched a missile attack Thursday aimed at the
man who has long been deemed Israel's most wanted terrorist, striking
a car and killing at least two people inside. But the militant group
Hamas denied that leader Mohammed Deif was among the dead.</LD>
<LD>   Two missiles struck the olive-green Mercedes-Benz on a crowded,
sun-baked street in Gaza City, turning the car into a smoldering heap
of twisted metal and body parts. Forty bystanders were injured,
including 15 children, hospital officials said.</LD>
<LD>   Hamas said two of its members inside the car and a bystander were
killed. Israeli television showed scenes captured minutes after the
attack in which a third man was shown being pulled from the back seat
of the Mercedes. It was not clear whether he was alive. "Deif was not
in the car, thank God," said Hamas spokesman Abdulaziz Rantisi, who
nevertheless vowed revenge against the Israelis. "We'll hit them
everywhere," he said.</LD>
<TE>   Israeli officials put the nation on high alert. They clung to the
hope that Deif was dead, but they acknowledged that they had not been
able to confirm his fate. Late Thursday, Israeli TV quoted
unidentified security officials as saying "the probability is high"
that he was killed. But Culture, Science and Sports Minister Matan
Vilnai told Israel's Army Radio later: "The reports I received from
our people were that [Deif] was indeed injured but did not suffer a
life-threatening injury."</TE>
<TE>   Deif, head of the Hamas military wing in the Gaza Strip, has been
Public Enemy No. 1 in Israel for six years--ever since his
predecessor at the top of the wanted list, bomb maker Yehiya Ayash,
known as "the Engineer," was killed by a booby-trapped cellular
telephone. No one has ever claimed responsibility, but it has been
widely assumed that the phone bomb was the work of Israeli
intelligence.</TE>
<TE>   Israeli officials said Deif was the mastermind behind dozens of
suicide bombings that claimed hundreds of Israeli lives.</TE>
<TE>   "Look, he's the most important army commander in Hamas," said
Yohanan Tsoref, a research fellow at Israel's International Policy
Institute for Counter-Terrorism. "He is the most important not only
from the professional point of view but from the symbolic point of
view."</TE>
<TE>   It was not believed to be the first time Israel has targeted Deif.
In August 2001, he was reported to have been in a car that was hit by
an Israeli missile in Gaza City. Nearby residents said Deif had
gotten out of the car before the missile hit and was seen fleeing.
However, both Hamas and Israeli officials denied that he had been
there.</TE>
<TE>   Deif was arrested by the Palestinian Authority in May 2000 but
spent only five months in jail. At 36, Deif had become "sort of a
father figure" to young Hamas militants because of his extensive
experience in carrying out attacks against Israel, Tsoref said.</TE>
<TE>   "But you know," Tsoref added, "Hamas is not an organization of one
man." If Deif is dead, Tsoref said, he would be quickly replaced.</TE>
<TE>   The attack came on a tumultuous day in Gaza and the West Bank.</TE>
<TE>   The day began with reports that a Palestinian--later identified as
a member of the Al Aqsa Martyrs Brigade, a militant group affiliated
with Palestinian Authority President Yasser Arafat's Fatah
movement--had been killed by Israeli soldiers while trying to attack
a Jewish settlement in the northern Gaza Strip. Then came word that a
Hamas activist and an Israeli soldier were killed in a gunfight in
the West Bank village of Labed, east of Tulkarm.</TE>
<TE>   Hospital officials in Hebron said a 14-month-old Palestinian girl
had died after inhaling tear gas fired by Israeli soldiers. And late
Thursday, four Israelis, including a month-old baby, were shot and
wounded in the West Bank city, according to Israeli media.</TE>
<TE>   Through all this, Israeli troops maintained their cordon around
the wrecked remains of Arafat's office in the West Bank city of
Ramallah. Arafat and about 250 other Palestinians in effect been
imprisoned there for a week, part of the Israeli response to a Sept.
19 attack in Tel Aviv that killed the suicide bomber and six
civilians.</TE>
<TE>   The campaign against Arafat has been sharply criticized, both
internationally and, to a lesser degree, within Israel. Arafat has
been struggling to maintain power and has recently condemned attacks
on civilians, leading some Israelis to question why Prime Minister
Ariel Sharon didn't go after the more radical Hamas leaders instead.
Sharon answered by saying that he did intend to attack Hamas, whose
strongholds are primarily in Gaza.</TE>
<TE>   On Monday, Israeli tanks and helicopter gunships launched an
assault against parts of Gaza City, destroying 13 reputed weapons
workshops and killing nine people.</TE>
<TE>   Those killed in Thursday's missile attack were identified as Abdel
Rahim Hamdan, 40, and Issa Baraka, 35, both members of the Hamas
military wing. Rantisi, the Hamas spokesman, said he went to the
hospital to identify them. There were conflicting reports about
whether Deif might have been injured in the attack, but Rantisi
insisted that the Hamas leader was not in the car that was attacked
or another car damaged nearby and that he was fine.</TE>
<TE>   Israel has a long-standing policy of assassinating militant
Palestinian leaders. Such killings have typically been followed by a
fresh wave of attacks against Israel.</TE>
<TE>   In the last such attack, on July 23, Israeli forces killed Hamas
military commander Salah Shehada. Fourteen Palestinian civilians also
died, and Hamas vowed to kill 100 Israelis in reprisal.</TE>
<TE>   Hamas went on to claim responsibility for three attacks: a bombing
at Hebrew University on July 31, in which nine people died; a bus
bombing Aug. 4 in which nine Israeli soldiers and civilians died; and
the Sept. 19 blast in Tel Aviv.</TE>
<TE>   "What I'm afraid of," said Yoram Meital, a professor of Middle
Eastern Studies at Ben Gurion University, "is that we are in the
beginning, maybe, of a new cycle of violence, more intensive than we
saw before, between Israel and the Hamas."</TE>

<HD>Milosevic Insists He Merely Tried to Defend Serbs</HD>
<DH>Trial: Yugoslav ex-leader rejects blame for crimes
committed in the wars over Croatia and Bosnia.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>WILLIAM WALLACE</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL>THE HAGUE</DL>
<LD>In an imperious manner that suggested he was still running Yugoslavia
rather than standing trial for crimes against humanity, former
President Slobodan Milosevic on Thursday derided prosecutors' claims
that he bore responsibility for the criminal carnage of the early
1990s Balkan wars. Instead, he portrayed himself as a peacemaker
reluctantly drawn into war to protect Serbs trapped as minorities on
the wrong side of borders when the fighting broke out.</LD>
<LD>   "I do not challenge that I tried to help the Serbs of Croatia and
Bosnia-Herzegovina survive," said Milosevic, who is defending himself
before a tribunal whose authority he claims not to recognize. "As for
this false indictment, it deprives Serbs of all rights--the right to
life and the right to defend themselves."</LD>
<LD>   The true villains, he alleged in a presentation that veered
between trenchant geopolitical analysis and obtuse conspiracy
theories, were Croatian fascists and Islamic fundamentalists who he
said provoked a war to tear apart the Yugoslav federation.</LD>
<TE>   Milosevic was speaking here at the opening of the second phase of
his war crimes trial, during which United Nations prosecutors will
try to link him to criminal acts committed during the wars of
secession in Croatia and Bosnia, when he was president of Serbia,
Yugoslavia's dominant republic.</TE>
<TE>   The 61-count indictment alleges that he had "effective control"
over army troops and paramilitary gangs that terrorized non-Serbs,
making him a party to genocide, forced deportations and crimes
against humanity such as torture.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors acknowledge that it will be a more difficult case to
make than the recently concluded phase of the trial, which focused on
the 1999 Kosovo conflict. Then, Milosevic was president of Yugoslavia
and it was easier to establish lines of communication and command to
the Yugoslav and Serbian forces in the field.</TE>
<TE>   During the earlier Croatian and Bosnian conflicts, the fighting
happened in jurisdictions outside what remains of Yugoslavia, and
prosecutors are believed to have less forensic evidence linking
Milosevic to atrocities.</TE>
<TE>   "He was not in there pulling the trigger," one war crimes
investigator in The Hague told The Times. "We have to show he knew
what was going on and, at best, did nothing to stop it."</TE>
<TE>   Yet prosecutors laid out an ambitious case in their opening
arguments.</TE>
<TE>   Milosevic operated in a "curiously empty room," dealing with
people on a one-to-one basis so they would not know what others were
being told, lead counsel Geoffrey Nice said.</TE>
<TE>   However, the British prosecutor promised to produce witnesses from
the former president's inner circle at the time who will craft a
portrait of Milosevic as a Serbian nationalist who participated in a
"joint criminal venture" to carve a Greater Serbia out of the
disintegrating Yugoslav federation.</TE>
<TE>   And that, Nice said, constitutes genocide. "The accused intended
to destroy the Bosnian Muslim population in part or in whole in order
to achieve those aims," he told the tribunal.</TE>
<TE>   To buttress his contention, Nice produced two population maps: a
prewar version showing the Yugoslav federation's then-jumble of
ethnic groups, and a later, "much tidier map, bought by thousands of
killings, innumerable acts of inhumanity and countless acts of ethnic
cleansing."</TE>
<TE>   "It is the inhumanity that leads to these charges," Nice said.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors say they also have evidence to link Milosevic to the
siege of Sarajevo, the Bosnian capital, as well as to the notorious
1995 massacre of more than 7,000 Muslim men and boys in the
U.N.-declared "safe area" of Srebrenica.</TE>
<TE>   For his part, Milosevic acknowledged that "of course, war crimes
existed on all three sides. But it was not policy, nor did that kind
of atmosphere exist in a broad sense."</TE>
<TE>   But his reference to the specific charges was brief. Allotted
three hours to rebut the prosecution's statement, Milosevic opted to
offer a sweeping perspective on recent Balkan history. He blamed
outside powers--the United States, Germany and the Vatican, in
particular--for conspiring to break up the Yugoslav federation and
turn Serbia "into a Third World country."</TE>
<TE>   Since the trial began in February, Milosevic has tried to portray
himself and his people as victims of aggression. "Serbia and myself
deserve recognition for working for peace in the area and not being a
protagonist of war," he said Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   The strategy is targeted at restoring his status among those
watching back in Belgrade, the Yugoslav and Serbian capital, as a
defender of Serbian interests, said Richard Dicker, an American who
is monitoring the trial for Human Rights Watch. "His principal
objective is to present a political offense, rather than put up a
legal defense."</TE>
<TE>   Not everyone is sure that is the wisest approach.</TE>
<TE>   "The only defense that can work is the one where he shows he did
what he could under the circumstances to stop the crimes," said
Anthony D'Amato, a professor of law at Northwestern University in
Chicago who was lead defense counsel for the war crimes trial of
Milan Kovacevic, another defendant at The Hague.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors will produce 177 witnesses to try to prove otherwise.
They hope to finish their case by May, after which Milosevic will
present his defense.</TE>
<TE>   But concerns also have developed about Milosevic's health. He put
on a feisty performance Thursday. But he has been diagnosed with
heart problems, and the judges have slowed the pace of the trial in
order not to tire him.</TE>

<HD>U.S. Expands Aggressive Defense in Iraq</HD>
<DH>Military: Punishing airstrikes are first stage of war,
analysts say. Meanwhile, White House continues effort to link
Baghdad, Al Qaeda.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN HENDREN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>American and British warplanes pounded an airport and a radar
facility Thursday at two sites in southern Iraq under a new Pentagon
policy that paves the way for a possible war by going beyond purely
defensive fire to launch devastating retaliatory strikes aimed at
permanently disabling Iraq's air defenses.</LD>
<LD>   The latest in an aggressive series of airstrikes in the southern
"no-fly" zone came as the Bush administration made a concerted effort
to link Al Qaeda terrorists with Iraq, offering new assertions that
Al Qaeda prisoners said they were trained in Iraq to make chemical
and biological weapons and had negotiated "safe haven" agreements
with Saddam Hussein's government. The disclosures, based on recently
declassified information, enhanced the philosophical basis for waging
a war, while the pounding of air defenses would prepare the
battlefield for the intensive bombing campaign that would probably
signal its beginning.</LD>
<LD>   President Bush has said he has not decided whether to pursue his
policy of "regime change" in Iraq by ousting Hussein by force, and is
waiting for congressional and United Nations resolutions, which he is
seeking to authorize an armed overthrow. But in a larger sense, some
military analysts said, the preparatory steps to battle have begun.</LD>
<TE>   "Let's be frank about it: They're preparing the battlefield for
the first stages of the invasion," said Ivo Daalder, a former
National Security Council aide now at the Brookings Institution in
Washington. "We're in the first stages of the war."</TE>
<TE>   U.S. and British forces in the southern no-fly zone have been
cleared to strike targets other than those firing at them since 1998,
a senior defense official said. Yet they appear not to have done so
systematically until recently. Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld
has said that he ordered a change within the past six months that
broadened the targets pilots could strike because, he said, he was
tired of having U.S. planes fired upon "with impunity."</TE>
<TE>   The policy marks a sweeping change from the days when Turkish
officials barred coalition planes from firing except in immediate
self-defense, and then only at the weapon that had fired at them,
said a defense official familiar with the no-fly zones.</TE>
<TE>   The change in strategy has become increasingly evident. At 12:45
a.m. Thursday in Iraq, U.S. and British planes simultaneously dropped
precision-guided bombs near Al Kufah and Basra, 90 miles south and
275 miles southeast of Baghdad, respectively. Four planes pounded
each of the sites, which included a radar facility and an airport
used by both civilians and the military. The strike at the airport
was in a remote part of the military side of the airfield, with no
civilians nearby, Marine Gen. Peter Pace, vice chairman of the Joint
Chiefs of Staff, said in a Pentagon briefing.</TE>
<TE>   Planes patrolling an area dominated by Shiite Muslims in a large
swath of southern Iraq have struck four times this month and 29 times
this year. Aircraft in a smaller northern region designed to protect
Iraqi Kurds have struck 10 times, according to Pentagon figures. The
zones were set up by Britain and the United States after the 1991
Persian Gulf War and are not related to the United Nations weapons
inspection program. U.S. military officials said Iraq has fired
surface-to-air missiles and antiaircraft artillery at coalition
planes 140 times this year. Iraq does not recognize the no-fly zones.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, a chorus of voices in the Bush administration offered
new, and strikingly similar, accounts of Al Qaeda ties with Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   First, Rumsfeld told reporters in Warsaw on Wednesday, without
elaborating, that U.S. intelligence confirmed ties between Iraq and
Al Qaeda. Asked about his comment, National Security Advisor
Condoleezza Rice said on PBS' "The NewsHour With Jim Lehrer" that
"high-ranking detainees" from the war in Afghanistan had reported
that the Iraqi government trained Al Qaeda in chemical weapons
development.</TE>
<TE>   Then the president weighed in.</TE>
<TE>   "The danger is that they will work in concert," Bush said at a
White House meeting with Colombian President Alvaro Uribe. "The
danger is that Al Qaeda becomes an extension of Saddam Hussein and
his hatred and his capacity to expand weapons of mass destruction."</TE>
<TE>   Finally, Rumsfeld elaborated in a Pentagon briefing Thursday,
saying Al Qaeda members were operating in Baghdad and had discussed
"safe haven" status as part of talks on possible "mutual
non-aggression" pacts with Hussein.</TE>
<TE>   The disclosures are unusual because they include information based
on a single source and some in which Rumsfeld said he did not have
"high confidence."</TE>
<TE>   "It's clearly a case of the administration constantly looking for
the most malevolent interpretation of whatever uncertain data they
have on this connection," said Michael O'Hanlon, a military analyst
at the Brookings Institution.</TE>
<TE>   The suggestion that Hussein, Iraq's president, has protected Al
Qaeda mirrors the administration's justification for waging war
against the Taliban government, which it said let Osama bin Laden
direct the terrorist organization from within Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   "We certainly have evidence of senior Al Qaeda who have been in
Baghdad," Rumsfeld said. "We have what we consider to be very
reliable reporting of senior-level contacts going back a decade and
of possible chemical- and biological-agent training ....</TE>
<TE>   "We do have--I believe it's one report indicating that Iraq
provided unspecified training relating to chemical and/or biological
matters for Al Qaeda members."</TE>
<TE>   None of the administration officials said they could link Iraq to
the Sept. 11 attacks.</TE>
<TE>   The defense secretary bristled when asked whether the White House
had orchestrated the content and timing of its disclosures, saying he
had simply asked intelligence officials to declassify the information
last week and it was on his desk when he returned from a trip to
Warsaw late Wednesday. The accounts sound similar, he said, because
they were based on the same declassified text.</TE>
<TE>   Administration officials are not alone in suggesting an Al Qaeda
tie to Iraq. Czech intelligence reports had said that Sept. 11
hijacker Mohamed Atta met an Iraqi agent in Prague, the Czech
capital, last year. The reports, however, were viewed with skepticism
by the CIA and later retracted by the Czech government.</TE>
<TE>   R. James Woolsey, former director of Central Intelligence, said
evidence ties Iraq to the 1993 World Trade Center bombing and
therefore makes a tie to the 2001 twin towers attack more likely.</TE>
<TE>   "There's just enough that ought to make people suspicious,"
Woolsey said in a Wednesday interview.</TE>
<TE>   Yet the theory has many skeptics. Al Qaeda followers have
advocated theocratic regimes such as the Taliban in Afghanistan and
have been critical of Hussein's secular, socialist government.
Although the group is known to operate in Kurdistan, the recent
disclosures are the first to suggest it operates in Baghdad. One
possible explanation is that Hussein trained people at a camp south
of Baghdad who later joined Al Qaeda, said Judith Yaphe, a former CIA
intelligence analyst who is now a researcher with National Defense
University in Washington.</TE>
<TE>   "The Iraqis will be in touch with anybody. I have no doubt that
Iraqi intelligence spoke with Atta," Yaphe said. "Does [Hussein]
train lots of nasty people? Yes. But the Al Qaeda is different to me
because some of them hated Saddam, and he was on their target list."</TE>

<DL>BERLIN</DL>
<LD>A German television network said Thursday that it had made a
scientific study of 450 photographs of Saddam Hussein in Iraq and
concluded that there are at least three look-alikes posing as the
Iraqi president.</LD>
<LD>   The ZDF public television network, working with a German coroner,
said it took the photographs and film clips of Hussein from its
archives and used facial recognition technology to determine that men
said to be him were look-alikes.</LD>
<LD>   "In the film sequences since 1998 only the doubles appear," said a
coroner whom ZDF consulted, Dieter Buhmann. "He himself has not been
seen again."</LD>
<TE>   ZDF said that "a scientific investigation proved that the
65-year-old ruler allows at least three doubles to replace him at
official appearances."</TE>
<TE>   ZDF said it was difficult to tell the look-alikes from Hussein.</TE>
<TE>   "They have apparently undergone surgery to appear to look like the
statesman," the television network said. "The doubles have mastered
Saddam's gestures and perfectly mimic Saddam, with only tiny details
separating them from the real Saddam Hussein."</TE>

<DL>PESHAWAR, Pakistan</DL>
<LD>Taliban fugitives and Afghan fighters loyal to a former foe have
become allies and are getting weapons and money from Al Qaeda and
Iran for planned suicide attacks on U.S. troops in Afghanistan, one
of their leaders says.</LD>
<LD>   The new alliance is said to be based in eastern Afghanistan and
involves men led by several former high-ranking Taliban officials and
fighters of Hezb-i-Islami, a group headed by former Afghan Prime
Minister Gulbuddin Hekmatyar.</LD>
<LD>   Hekmatyar's force was one of the U.S.-aided guerrilla armies that
fought the Soviets in the 1980s. He fled to Iran in 1996 after his
group was defeated by the Taliban, but he has been seeking to incite
a war against U.S. forces in Afghanistan.</LD>
<TE>   The new alliance is known as Lashkar Fedayan-i-Islami, or the
Islamic Martyrs Brigade, a Hekmatyar military commander, Salauddin
Safi, said at a meeting Wednesday in this frontier city.</TE>
<TE>   "There will be suicide attacks, ambushes by suicide attackers and
bomb blasts against soldiers as they are moving from place to place
and when they go out and disperse into smaller numbers, like in
searches," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Safi said the alliance plans to attack only American military
targets. He said the group had nothing to do with a Sept. 5 car
bombing that killed 30 people and wounded more than 150 in Kabul, the
Afghan capital.</TE>
<TE>   Western intelligence sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity,
confirmed an alliance between the Taliban and Hekmatyar. They also
said they believe that the alliance is receiving money from a variety
of sources, including the Al Qaeda terrorist network and Iran.</TE>
<TE>   However, neither Western nor Pakistani intelligence sources could
confirm the existence of the new group or the formation of suicide
bombing squads.</TE>
<TE>   Safi said the alliance's fighters are from the Taliban and
Hezb-i-Islami. "Al Qaeda is not helping with men, but with money," he
said. Iran also "is helping with money and weapons," Safi said. He
wouldn't give any specifics.</TE>
<TE>   Washington has accused Iran of trying to destabilize Afghan
President Hamid Karzai's government by sending commandos to
Afghanistan to incite tribal feuding and by supplying weapons and
money to his opponents. Iran has denied the charges.</TE>

<HD>Ukraine Denies Selling Radar to Iraq</HD>
<DH>Military: Envoy invites inspectors to probe whether his

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>UNITED NATIONS</DL>
<LD>Ukraine's foreign minister Thursday rejected U.S. accusations that
his country sold a radar system to Iraq, and he invited U.N. or
American inspectors to investigate charges that it had violated U.N.
sanctions against Baghdad.</LD>
<LD>   Anatoly Zlenko met with U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan briefly
before discussing the accusations with Ole Peter Kolby, the Norwegian
ambassador who heads the U.N. sanctions committee.</LD>
<LD>   Zlenko also planned to discuss the matter in a meeting with
diplomats from the United States, Britain, France, Russia and
China--the five permanent Security Council members.</LD>
<TE>   "The accusation is groundless," Zlenko told reporters. He called
for an international investigation, led by U.N. weapons inspectors or
a team of international experts.</TE>
<TE>   The State Department said this week that authentic audiotapes
provided by a former Ukrainian security official indicated that
Ukrainian President Leonid D. Kuchma personally approved the transfer
of a Kolchuga radar system to Iraq in violation of the sanctions. The
system can detect approaching aircraft without tipping off their
pilots.</TE>
<TE>   The State Department also said that Ukrainian officials have been
in contact with the U.S. about the alleged sale but doubted that they
had been honest.</TE>
<TE>   In a meeting over the alleged arms sale, Kuchma told British
Defense Secretary Geoff Hoon on Thursday that he would prove the
charges false.</TE>
<TE>   "Ukraine's president stressed that Ukraine did not supply any
weapons to Iraq," Kuchma spokeswoman Olena Hromnytska said.</TE>
<TE>   The U.N. Security Council imposed a strict embargo on Iraq after
Baghdad invaded neighboring Kuwait in 1990 and sparked the 1991

<HD>Cuba Trade Show Kicks Off With a Hearty Welcome From Castro</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PAUL RICHTER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>HAVANA</DL>
<LD>President Fidel Castro gave a bearhug welcome Thursday to thousands
of American businesspeople at a U.S.-Cuban trade show, even as the
groundbreaking event set off a cross-fire between the Cuban leader
and Bush administration officials.</LD>
<LD>   Castro welcomed representatives of nearly 300 U.S. companies--the
largest gathering of Americans in Cuba since the 1959 revolution--at
a food exhibition in suburban Havana that is intended to strengthen
trade ties. The 76-year-old leader sampled goods and declared
Americans "will always be welcome" in the country.</LD>
<LD>   Yet Castro also responded sharply to comments of the senior U.S.
diplomat in Cuba that, despite the show, trade between the two
nations is not likely to amount to much.</LD>
<TE>   James Cason, head of the U.S. Interests Section in Havana, told
reporters Wednesday that Cuba had a "Jurassic Park economy," and he
raised questions about whether the island nation could pay for the
food it wants to import.</TE>
<TE>   Castro insisted Thursday that his government would make good on
its obligations, and said he was willing to bet Cason $100,000 to
prove it.</TE>
<TE>   The exchange was the latest controversy to dog the show. The U.S.
businesses want to expand the $140 million in food sales that are now
permitted under a congressionally approved exception to the
40-year-old embargo on trade and travel with Cuba. But Bush
administration officials believe such commerce would only prop up the
impoverished Communist regime.</TE>
<TE>   In recent weeks, administration officials have referred to Cuba as
a terrorist state and contended that Castro uses American visitors as
"props" for his regime. The administration wants to keep the support
of staunchly anti-Castro Cuban American voters in Florida, who were
important to President Bush in the 2000 election and could be crucial
in the November reelection bid of his brother, Gov. Jeb Bush.</TE>
<TE>   At the show's opening, Castro stood between Cuban and American
flags and among such luminaries as Allen Andreas, chairman of
agribusiness giant Archer Daniels Midland Co., and Minnesota Gov.
Jesse Ventura. Pedro Alvarez, head of the Cuban agency that oversees
food imports, drew thunderous applause by extending Cuban sympathies
on the Sept. 11 "criminal and terrorist attacks."</TE>
<TE>   Alvarez said Cuba is importing about 16% of its food from the U.S.
but would like to increase that share to 60% within the next several
years.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. food company executives said they were mystified by the Bush
administration's attitude toward the gathering. They pointed out that
the U.S. government had granted the license for the event, though
officials probably could have found a reason not to do so if they had
wished. They also said the Commerce Department and Treasury
Department have been highly cooperative.</TE>
<TE>   Yet at the senior level, U.S. officials have made it clear that
they do not approve of attempts to broaden trade with the regime,
they said. "It is somewhat puzzling to the exhibitors," said Peter W.
Nathan, the longtime trade show organizer who put together the event.</TE>
<TE>   One U.S. businessman, who asked to remain unidentified, said the
contradiction suggests that the government may not really oppose the
trade opening, even though "there's all this rhetoric about it at a
public level." Cuban officials said they planned to sign hundreds of
purchase contracts with the U.S. firms for a total of about $50
million worth of food. About 90% of the exhibitors will receive
contracts, the Cubans have told show officials.</TE>
<TE>   Three members of Congress and representatives of seven state
governments were present to promote local exports. The exhibitors
included such concerns as Cargill, Tyson Foods Inc., Perdue Farms,
and Hormel Foods, as well as Archer Daniels Midland, the principal
sponsor.</TE>
<TE>   Larry White and Les Paulson, who are in the food processing
business in North Dakota, said they were impressed by Cuba's
undeveloped business potential.</TE>
<TE>   They said they were surprised to see that waterfront properties in
Havana could be allowed to crumble and that the picturesque harbor
could be almost bereft of boats. "This whole country is like a car up
on blocks," White said.</TE>
<TE>   But Paulson added that the day Cuba opens up to development--with
American help--"this place will bloom like a rose."</TE>

<HD>U.S., Britain in Step on Iraq Resolution</HD>
<DH>Diplomacy: Security Council support is sought for a tough
disarmament measure. Bush seeks bipartisan backing in Congress.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBIN WRIGHT and JANET HOOK</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The United States has reached general agreement with Britain on a
strongly worded U.N. resolution on Iraq and launched a diplomatic
offensive to win support from Russia, France and China, the three
other members of the Security Council with veto power, Secretary of
State Colin L. Powell said Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   The current draft of the resolution would allow United Nations
members to use "all necessary means" to deal with the regime of Iraqi
President Saddam Hussein if his country refuses to meet U.N. demands
that it eliminate weapons of mass destruction.</LD>
<LD>   Senior U.S. and British diplomats left Thursday for France and
Russia to try to win the support of those nations, which have
expressed strong reservations about the use of force if Iraq does not
give up any nuclear, chemical and biological weapons and ballistic
missiles it might possess.</LD>
<TE>   Powell acknowledged that the United States is still "a long way"
from getting a final agreement because of strong views within the
Security Council.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the White House continued to seek bipartisan backing
for congressional authorization to use force against Iraq. Just one
day after bickering between President Bush and Senate Democrats
seemed destined to slow action on the administration's request,
congressional leaders circulated a possible compromise with changes
to address lawmakers' concern that Bush's proposal was too broad and
open-ended. Bush sounded more conciliatory in discussing Congress'
action on the issue.</TE>
<TE>   The proposed U.N. resolution includes three key parts. It holds
Iraq in "material breach" for violations of several past U.N.
resolutions, a phrase pivotal to the potential use of force. On a
tight timetable, it calls on Iraq to fully and immediately comply
with all 16 past U.N. resolutions, particularly its pledge to
surrender any weapons of mass destruction.</TE>
<TE>   Most important, it lays out the consequences of Iraq's failure to
comply, including the right of member states to take appropriate
action in response--a euphemism for the use of force. This is the
most controversial aspect of the draft, which faces opposition from
France, the Arab world and many of the 10 nonpermanent members of the
Security Council.</TE>
<TE>   Although the timing is not specified in the current draft, there
is a general understanding that U.N. inspectors should be allowed to
return within two weeks and that Iraq should cede any of its
deadliest weapons within six months, according to U.S. and U.N.
officials.</TE>
<TE>   In the tough diplomatic bargaining that lies ahead, the U.S. feels
strongly that the resolution must include "hard consequences" for
Iraq if it does not comply with all U.N. resolutions, Powell told the
Senate Foreign Relations Committee.</TE>
<TE>   "We must keep the pressure on," he said. "The United States has
made it clear to our Security Council colleagues that we will not
fall for this ploy. This is the time to apply more pressure, not to
relent."</TE>
<TE>   But he noted ongoing differences within the Security Council, with
some nations arguing that there is no need for a new resolution. "We
are listening to other points of view and we are working to reach
agreement," he said. "It is a difficult debate. There are strong
views, one way or the other."</TE>
<TE>   Powell, who is largely responsible for persuading the Bush
administration to detour to the United Nations on the road to
Baghdad, said having no new authority from the world body to pressure
Hussein would be "a recipe for failure."</TE>
<TE>   U.N. diplomats had hoped that a final draft could be formally
introduced in the Security Council on or before Monday, when chief
U.N. weapons inspector Hans Blix is scheduled to meet Iraqi
representatives in Vienna. But the resolution might not be finished
before midweek, U.N. envoys said Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. is hoping to avoid having to go back to the United
Nations if Iraq fails to comply with the world body's demands.
France, with strong backing from several member states, is still
pressing for a two-step process that would separate the possible use
of force from the current resolution. Instead, a second resolution
would have to be passed if and when Iraq balks.</TE>
<TE>   France is lobbying hard for its position. After talks in Paris on
Thursday, French President Jacques Chirac and Chinese Premier Zhu
Rongji said their nations remain committed to deferring the issue of
force until Iraq balks.</TE>
<TE>   Chirac also conferred Thursday by telephone with Russian President
Vladimir V. Putin. Afterward, French spokeswoman Catherine Colonna
said, "France and Russia have the same approach to the Iraqi issue."</TE>
<TE>   But ceding to pressure from hawks inside the Bush administration,
Washington may be willing to scrap language on the consequences for
Iraq in the current resolution rather than go through another intense
round of even more complex and controversial diplomacy down the road
to win backing for the use of force, U.S. officials said Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   "We're now feeling that we've made a psychological leap, that we
don't need further justification. Clearly we'll ask for it, but if we
don't get it, we won't need to go back for it," said an
administration official who asked to remain anonymous.</TE>
<TE>   Powell alluded to the emerging position in his Senate testimony.</TE>
<TE>   "We are trying to solve the problem through the United Nations and
in a multilateral way," he said. "But at the same time, if the United
Nations is not able to act and to act decisively--then the United
States will have to make its own decision." The debate at home over
congressional authorization for the use of force is less acrimonious,
albeit also not ended. The new draft, which is supported by the White
House, would more narrowly focus the measure on Iraq and would
require Bush to report to Congress periodically on the actions he
takes against the Hussein regime.</TE>
<TE>   Senate Republican leader Trent Lott of Mississippi said it has
"good language and we should go forward with it."</TE>
<TE>   But Democrats said the measure did not go far enough in specifying
the parameters of Bush's war-making powers and called for further
negotiations on additional changes.</TE>
<TE>   "We have come some distance," said Senate Majority Leader Tom
Daschle (D-S.D.). "But we have a long way to go." Still, Daschle said
he intended to bring the issue to the Senate floor next week.</TE>
<TE>   Bush's original proposal would have given him broad, open-ended
power to use force against Iraq, as well as to secure "peace and
stability in the region." Members of both parties objected that such
broad language would have authorized military action beyond the
bounds of Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   The new draft dropped the reference to regional stability and
instead focuses on Iraq. It would authorize Bush to use force "as he
determines to be necessary and appropriate in order to defend the
national security interests of the United States against the threat
posed by Iraq" and to enforce U.N. resolutions calling on Baghdad to
eliminate chemical, biological and nuclear weapons and end support
for terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   The new draft also requires Bush to report to Congress on how he
uses this power at least once every 90 days.</TE>
<TE>   Despite those concessions, Daschle said Democrats were interested
in "delineating more specifically what the White House would be
empowered to do" and in putting in more stringent language to ensure
that other options--at the U.N. and in the international
community--have been exhausted before force was used.</TE>
<TE>   Democratic ranks will begin to break today, when Sen. Edward M.
Kennedy (D-Mass.) will give a speech announcing his opposition to the
use of force in Iraq because it will "inevitably undermine the global
war on terrorism."</TE>
<TE>   "The administration has not made a convincing case for a
unilateral strike, a preemptive strike or an immediate war," Kennedy
will say.</TE>
<TE>   But the president Thursday predicted that a "strong resolution"
would eventually win congressional approval. Stepping back from
tensions that had surfaced after each party accused the other of
politicizing the issue, Bush said after meeting at the White House
with six Republican and 14 Democratic House members, "The security of
our country is the commitment of both political parties and the
responsibility of both elected branches of government.</TE>
<TE>   "We are engaged in a deliberate and civil and thorough
discussion," he said. He added, "All of us, and many others in
Congress, are united in our determination to confront an urgent
threat to America."</TE>
<TE>   Pressing for speedy action, Bush said: "Each passing day could be
the one on which the Iraqi regime gives anthrax, or VX nerve gas, or
someday a nuclear weapon, to a terrorist ally."</TE>

<HD>A Simple Yes to Monitors Is Baghdad's Top Defense</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>TYLER MARSHALL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>UNITED NATIONS</DL>
<LD>As the United States presses its case for swift military action
against Saddam Hussein, those tracking the crisis believe that the
most effective tactic in the Iraqi president's arsenal for
counterattack may be a simple word: yes.</LD>
<LD>   Political analysts believe that if Hussein holds to the offer to
allow international weapons inspectors back into his country and lets
them into at least a few sensitive areas early on, he could achieve
two important tactical advantages:</LD>
<LD>   * Provide new fodder for those searching for ways to avert
military action against him.</LD>
<TE>   * Delay a U.S.-led attack long enough to conceivably make it
impossible to complete before the onset of the hot season next
spring. Excessive heat and a shortage of water would make a
large-scale military operation next to impossible, analysts say.</TE>
<TE>   "If Saddam can stretch this out through March, he's probably
bought himself another eight months," summed up a senior Bush
administration official who requested anonymity.</TE>
<TE>   Joseph Cirincione, an arms control specialist at the Carnegie
Endowment for International Peace in Washington, noted that despite
the Bush administration's heated rhetoric toward Iraq, "nothing is
going to happen soon--neither inspections, nor war. Both take time."</TE>
<TE>   Such realities provide a jarring disconnect with the sense of
urgency conveyed by the administration.</TE>
<TE>   The power of the word "yes" was on display last week when Iraq
suddenly offered to allow the unconditional return of weapons
inspectors after a four-year absence. The move undercut--at least
temporarily--gathering support for U.S. efforts to mobilize the
United Nations behind a tough new stance against Hussein.</TE>
<TE>   Although subsequent statements from Baghdad indicated that the
offer was less sweeping than initially believed, it broke America's
diplomatic momentum just as the Bush administration was pushing for a
strong U.N. Security Council resolution on Iraq. On Thursday, Russian
President Vladimir V. Putin referred to Iraq's gesture on the
inspectors as a genuine opportunity to resolve the crisis peacefully.</TE>
<TE>   In hopes of boxing Hussein in, the administration is expected to
load any final U.N. resolution with other conditions--including a
halt to the persecution of Iraq's civilian population and the release
of information on the fate of all prisoners from the 1991 Persian
Gulf War--that could provide a trigger for military action if not
quickly fulfilled.</TE>
<TE>   Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld on Thursday worked to broaden
the case against Hussein, saying that the U.S. now has "solid
evidence" linking the Iraqi leader with the Al Qaeda terrorist
network. However, analysts believe that it may prove far harder to
muster international support for military action based on violations
not related to the issue of whether Iraq possesses weapons of mass
destruction.</TE>
<TE>   The administration's attempt to broaden the case against Hussein
follows U.S. efforts to press what it sees as the need to act soon.</TE>
<TE>   In a speech last month, Vice President Dick Cheney declared, "Many
of us are convinced that Saddam will acquire nuclear weapons fairly
soon."</TE>
<TE>   Only days later, in an address to the U.N. General Assembly,
President Bush described Hussein's regime as "a grave and gathering
danger" and hard-liners within the administration talked of a U.N.
resolution that could trigger a military option if Baghdad failed to
comply with the world body's demands "within days."</TE>
<TE>   But U.N. weapons inspectors say that, even with Baghdad's
cooperation, taking an accurate measure of Iraq's chemical,
biological and nuclear weapons capabilities is likely to take months,
not weeks or days.</TE>
<TE>   "We'll not drag our feet, but this is a complicated job," said
Ewen Buchanan, spokesman for the U.N. inspectors' office here. "It
can't be done overnight."</TE>
<TE>   Buchanan cited one example: Under existing U.N. resolutions, Iraq
is obligated every six months to provide a list of locations and
activities of so-called dual-use facilities--laboratories, factories
or buildings that can be used for both military and civilian
activities. Buchanan said that with a four-year backlog, these
reports are likely to run thousands of pages in length.</TE>
<TE>   Routine tasks such as gathering inspectors from the U.N.'s
worldwide roster of 200 trained experts and retooling computers,
vehicles and other equipment left behind in Baghdad also are likely
to delay the start of inspections and initial evaluations, Buchanan
noted.</TE>
<TE>   Although inspectors would probably want to test immediately any
new powers that might come with a new resolution for complete and
unfettered access to possible weapons production sites, it would take
several weeks to launch extensive inspections, according to Buchanan.
He said it would be hard to shorten drastically the two months
allotted under the current U.N. timetable for establishing what new
material and equipment Iraq may have.</TE>
<TE>   "We'll try to squeeze this [timing] somewhat, but it's difficult,"
he said.</TE>
<TE>   Composition of the new U.N. weapons inspection group--known
formally as the United Nations Monitoring, Verification and
Inspection Commission--could also shape its initial effectiveness. In
contrast to earlier inspectors, many of whom were given valuable
intelligence information by the national governments that paid their
salaries, the new monitors will be U.N. employees, paid with funds
generated by Iraq's "oil for food" program.</TE>
<TE>   The United States, eager for aggressive, well-targeted
inspections, must decide how much intelligence it should offer
inspectors over whom it has no direct control. Hans Blix, the chief
U.N. inspector, has indicated that his group has received some data
from member states, and Buchanan said he expected the flow of
information to increase once inspectors arrive on the scene.</TE>
<TE>   "If people know we can act on tips we get, the flow of information
should increase," Buchanan said.</TE>
<TE>   Still, if Hussein allows the initial inspections to go forward,
analysts believe it could easily buy him time--and complicate the
Bush administration's campaign against him. Soldiers forced to wear
bulky equipment to protect them against possible chemical or
biological weapons would find it difficult to fight if the war
continued through the hot weather that settles into the region each
spring. Supplying enough water for both soldiers and vehicles also
would become a major problem.</TE>
<TE>   The analysts note that it will be difficult politically for the
administration to sustain over a long period the sense of urgency it
has generated through the drumbeat of its recent rhetoric.</TE>
<TE>   They also believe that if the sense of immediacy to the crisis
begins to fade, more questions will probably emerge about the need to
use force to accomplish disarmament.</TE>
<TE>   "We may be at the high-water mark of the administration's ability
to control the debate," said Cirincione, the arms control specialist.
"Doubts will grow about the wisdom of an invasion as time goes on."</TE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Southern California's defense industry--the nerve center for advanced
weapons and surveillance technology for the U.S. military--is quietly
gearing up for a potential attack against Iraq.</LD>
<LD>   At Pentagon contractors throughout the region, engineers have been
ordered to put vacations on hold. Some have been told to plan for
longer spells at the office. And companies that make sophisticated
intelligence-gathering equipment have been directed by the government
to field new technologies ahead of schedule.</LD>
<LD>   TRW Inc. engineers in Carson, for instance, were told last week to
immediately begin supplying a new battlefield computer system to
troops in the Persian Gulf region, although the equipment is still in
the testing phase. The computers, similar to civilian laptop devices,
are designed to give Army units down to squad level instant access to
battlefield information, including the positions of enemy targets and
the locations of other U.S. troops.</LD>
<TE>   Citing the need for discretion, industry executives are declining
to comment publicly on the surge of activity. But based on interviews
with engineers who requested anonymity, the busiest companies appear
to be those that specialize in technologies for intelligence,
surveillance and reconnaissance work, as well as those working to
improve the accuracy of missiles and bombs.</TE>
<TE>   "We can't talk much about what we are doing, but the activity here
has definitely stepped up," a TRW executive said.</TE>
<TE>   A Southland aerospace engineer, who spoke on condition that he not
be identified, said: "It sounds like we're going to get pretty busy."
The engineer, who had to work through several seven-day weeks
providing technical support for U.S. troops during the initial
military operations in Afghanistan last fall, said he was told to
expect a similar schedule starting next month.</TE>
<TE>   Nearly a quarter of the Pentagon's research and development funds
are funneled to companies in California, by far the largest of any
state. The bulk of those companies are located in Southern California
and employ a total of about 50,000 people.</TE>
<TE>   Or at least that's the official estimate.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, many Southern California companies are engaged in
so-called black programs, highly classified military projects whose
budgets are secret. Because of the hidden nature of these programs,
the precise number of engineers and companies involved in military
preparations in the Los Angeles region is not known--or, for that
matter, even visible. Much of the work here involves classified
engineering research conducted in nondescript, often-windowless
buildings deep within office complexes.</TE>
<TE>   One of the biggest players in the local aerospace community is
Century City-based Northrop Grumman Corp. The company's Integrated
Systems Group in El Segundo, which developed the B-2 stealth bomber,
is designing the latest unmanned aircraft and airborne surveillance
equipment.</TE>
<TE>   Other notable defense companies in the area include:</TE>
<TE>   * TRW Inc. in Redondo Beach and Carson, which builds mili- tary
communication satellites and battlefield command-and-control systems.</TE>
<TE>   * Boeing Co. in Seal Beach and Anaheim, which designs and develops
next-generation spy satellites and military communication systems.</TE>
<TE>   * Raytheon Corp. in El Segundo, which is developing radar-jamming
equipment, sensors for spy planes, and targeting and guidance systems
for missiles.</TE>
<TE>   * Lockheed Martin Corp. in Palmdale, which conducts classified
aircraft design and development programs at its famed Skunk Works.
Lockheed Martin also engineers upgraded equipment for F-117 stealth
fighters and U-2 spy planes.</TE>
<TE>   * Aerospace Corp. in El Segundo, a government-funded research
center, which assists and supervises development of advanced spy
satellites and other classified intelligence programs.</TE>
<TE>   Aviation Week &amp; Space Technology magazine reported last week that
six such satellites have been maintaining a close watch on Iraq.
Three of the satellites are equipped with optical and infrared
sensors that can see through darkness and foul weather for evidence
of nuclear, chemical and biological weapons development, the report
said.</TE>
<TE>   At Raytheon, engineers who work on precision-guided weapons and
other classified programs were told--without explanation--to postpone
vacations between October and the end of the year.</TE>
<TE>   A Raytheon spokesman declined to comment but acknowledged that the
company had received Pentagon orders to accelerate production of
certain products including "Little Buddy" electronic decoys. Raytheon
engineers in Goleta, near Santa Barbara, designed the decoys, which
are towed behind fighters and bombers. The Little Buddy is designed
to electronically fool an antiaircraft missile into hitting it
instead of the aircraft.</TE>
<TE>   The anticipation of hostilities with Iraq has sent defense
industry stocks surging in recent months, with investors figuring
that a conflict would boost weapons orders and fuel additional
research funding.</TE>
<TE>   Shares of many Pentagon contractors, especially those focused on
developing high-tech weapons, already were trading at record levels
in the aftermath of military action in Afghanistan last fall.
Northrop's shares have jumped 55% since the terrorist attacks last
year, and Raytheon is up 30% and TRW 75%, while the market as a whole
has declined.</TE>
<TE>   Although much of the high-tech research activity has centered on
Southern California, weapons makers in other states also have been
bustling with activity in recent months.</TE>
<TE>   In Tucson, where Raytheon manufactures weapons, production of
Paveway air-to-surface and Tomahawk cruise missiles has tripled in
recent months. The Paveway, a laser-guided missile, could have
significant use in Iraq, defense analysts said, because it can carry
a new bunker-busting warhead that is designed to kill troops hidden
deep inside hardened underground chambers.</TE>
<TE>   Raytheon executives confirmed that they also have been asked to
upgrade Tomahawk cruise missiles so they can be guided by signals
from Global Positioning System satellites, making them effective in
any weather.</TE>
<TE>   The Pentagon also has asked Boeing to double the production rate
of kits that turn so-called dumb bombs into much more accurate guided
bombs. The JDAM kits--for joint direct attack munition--are attached
to gravity bombs and, using signals from GPS satellites, can guide
the weapons to their targets with extreme accuracy.</TE>
<TE>   The supply of kits is being replenished after a larger-than-
expected number were used in Afghanistan. About 9,000 of the 24,000
bombs dropped there were equipped with JDAM kits. The remainder were
either laser-guided or free-fall bombs.</TE>
<TE>   Boeing has been asked to boost production of JDAM kits from about
700 a month to 1,500.</TE>
<TE>   "I get the general impression that things are going to start
moving rather quickly after the November elections and everybody
wants to have their ducks lined up if the president decided to move
sooner than later," said John Pike, director of GlobalSecurity.org, a
defense research firm. "Things might happen rather quickly after the
election, and anybody that says nothing will happen until February
will be surprised."</TE>

<LD>A year after the Sept. 11 attacks, American Muslim
leaders increasingly fear their community is being pushed to the margins
of the American political system.</LD>
<LD>   "On the political scene, we are back to square one," said Hussam
Ayloush of the Council on American-Islamic Relations. "In general,
there is a fear that associating too closely with Muslims could be a
liability."</LD>
<LD>   Until the attacks, Muslims had been making steady gains in moving
into the American mainstream. Muslims were just beginning to win
appointments to government commissions. Politicians were knocking on
the doors of their mosques, asking for support. Muslims were becoming
politically emboldened to run for office themselves--producing 700
candidates for local, state and federal offices in 2000, according to
Agha Saeed of the American Muslim Alliance.</LD>
<TE>   In the weeks directly following the attacks, it seemed possible
that trend would continue. National leaders, following the lead of
President Bush, insisted that the U.S. war on terror should not
become an occasion for turning against the nation's Muslims. And many
Muslims say that ordinary Americans have reached out to them since
the attacks--church members who offered to guard an Islamic school,
women who donned head scarves to escort Muslim women on errands,
casual acquaintances who have become friends.</TE>
<TE>   Since January, however, the landscape has shifted.</TE>
<TE>   Evidence of a hardening of attitudes against Muslims--at least on
the part of some Americans--comes in several forms. So far this year,
more than 20 books on the "Islamic menace" have been published. Two
of those books are the best-selling titles among 7,219 books on Islam
at Amazon.com: "American Jihad: The Terrorists Among Us," by Steven
Emerson, and "Militant Islam Reaches America," by Daniel Pipes.</TE>
<TE>   Leading figures among evangelical Christian denominations have
made a series of public statements denouncing Islam as an evil.</TE>
<TE>   And polls show that although Americans have gained familiarity
with Islam, their increased knowledge has not led to greater
approval. In a recent Los Angeles Times poll, 37% of those surveyed
said they had a negative impression of Islam, compared with 28% whose
impression was favorable.</TE>
<TE>   While those surveyed had a more positive impression of American
Muslims than of their faith, roughly a quarter said they had a
negative impression of American Muslims.</TE>
<TE>   Politicians appear to be responding to those developments and are
shying away from Islamic conferences, Muslim activists say. Not a
single national politician appeared at a recent convention of 30,000
Muslims in Washington, D.C., for example. Najee Ali, an activist with
Project Islamic Hope, said one member of Congress even told him she
would be in a photo with him only on the condition that it did not
appear in any Muslim newspaper.</TE>
<TE>   Muslim activists say the ostracism extends to the White
House, where Bush met with a group of leaders shortly after the attacks,
then went nearly a year before seeing any of them again.</TE>
<TE>   Although Salam Al-Marayati of the Muslim Public Affairs Council
called the recent meeting a useful "steppingstone" to reopen
dialogue, the perceived snub came as a disappointment to activists in
major Muslim organizations who had high hopes for political inclusion
and impact when they gave Bush their first-ever coordinated
presidential endorsement in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   The dicey political environment has drastically reduced the number
of Muslims running for political office this year--only about 100,
one-seventh of the number two years ago, Saeed said.</TE>
<TE>   The recent arrests of six Muslims in New York on charges of
supporting terrorism and the 17-hour detention of three Muslim
medical students in Florida on suspicion of terrorism have only added
to the American Islamic community's worries.</TE>
<TE>   To critics, the New York arrests amplified fears of an Islamic
"fifth column" in America, while many Muslims see the Florida men,
who were later released, as evidence of injustices caused by
paranoia.</TE>
<TE>   "The tragedy," said Aslam Abdullah of the Los Angeles-based
Minaret magazine, "is that American Muslims were working so hard to
be accepted as equal citizens, and now all of a sudden they find they
have to prove their loyalty all over again."</TE>
<TE>   American Muslims remain a small minority group; estimates have
ranged from about 2 million to 7 million. Educating Americans about
their faith has been a priority for Muslim activists.</TE>
<TE>   The attacks clearly have increased the amount of information
Americans have about Islam and its American followers. Books about
the religion have become bestsellers; college courses have sprung up
nationwide.</TE>
<TE>   At the Islamic Society's national headquarters in Plainville,
Ind., Sayyid Syeed said his speaking engagements last September
topped 100, compared to 15 or so in a normal month, and hits on his
organization's Web site have tripled to 3 million a month. In
Southern California, Ayloush said the normally insular Muslim
community has staged more than 70 open houses, interfaith events and
other activities.</TE>
<TE>   And Americans clearly feel they know more about Islam now than in
the past. In 1993, when the Los Angeles Times poll asked Americans
their impression of Islam, fully 64% said they did not know enough to
have an opinion. Asked again last month, only 34% said they knew too
little.</TE>
<TE>   That greater knowledge, however, has not improved the overall view
that Americans hold of Islam. In the poll a decade ago, 22% had an
unfavorable impression of Islam, compared to 14% with a favorable
view--a margin virtually identical to the one in the recent poll.</TE>
<TE>   Many Muslim activists blame what one called "a troika of
evangelical Christians, right-wing conservatives and the pro-Israel
lobby" for their plight.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, the Times poll showed that unfavorable impressions of
Muslims are stronger among Republicans than among either Democrats or
political independents.</TE>
<TE>   Among evangelical Christians, such influential leaders as
evangelist Franklin Graham and the Rev. Jerry Vines, former president
of the 16-million-member Southern Baptist Convention, have sharply
criticized Islam in recent months. In remarks that made national
headlines, Vines called Muhammad a "demon-possessed pedophile," and
Graham has repeatedly portrayed Islam as an evil and violent
religion.</TE>
<TE>   Islam, a monotheistic faith established by the Prophet Muhammad in
Arabia in the 7th century, shares common roots with Judaism and
Christianity. But negative perceptions of Islam have long been a
current in some Christian churches and appear to be shared by many
born-again Christians.</TE>
<TE>   "Until a year ago, most evangelical Christians saw Islam as a
problem because we believe it to be a false religion," said Richard
Land of the Southern Baptists' ethics and religious liberty
commission. "What's happened since 9/11 is that evangelical
Christians as a community have become far more aware of the
radicalization of significant elements of the Islamic population and
the direct threat that represents to Western civilization and freedom
of conscience."</TE>
<TE>   Like a host of faith and political leaders, Land called on
moderate Muslims to more aggressively denounce their extremist
elements. Such calls, however, frustrate Muslim activists, who
produce long lists of statements of condemnation they've made and
wearily ask what more is demanded.</TE>
<TE>   Many Muslims say they have found greater acceptance among ordinary
Americans than among political or religious leaders.</TE>
<TE>   That dichotomy is evident even in the Bible Belt, in places like
Greenville, Texas, where Southern Baptist congregations thickly dot
the landscape. Here, the Rev. Sam Douglass recently invited a Muslim
convert to Christianity to give testimony to several hundred members
of his Ridgecrest Baptist Church on how he had been saved by Jesus.
Afterward, Douglass expounded on his own view of Islam, a faith he
said he studied during years as a campus minister.</TE>
<TE>   "The faith of Islam does not respect the value of human life as
Christians do," declared Douglass. Stressing that he loves Muslim
people, Douglass said the faith itself "is a threat to anyone they
can label an infidel, and that means that anyone not part of the
Muslim world is in danger."</TE>
<TE>   But sitting in his congregation, Gene and Karen Rhodes, both
born-again Christians, were skeptical of the peril Douglass
perceived. The couple said they had known nothing about Islam until
meeting a visiting Muslim student four months ago. They quickly
agreed to disagree about faith and put the matter aside, Karen Rhodes
said; since then, what began as a shared professional interest in
special education and children blossomed into a deep personal
friendship that the couple says now feels like family.</TE>
<TE>   The Rhodes say they have frequently invited their Muslim friend to
their home for dinner, even throwing a birthday party for
him--despite efforts by some of their Christian friends to dissuade
them from the relationship.</TE>
<TE>   "I have trouble believing Islam is violent," said Gene Rhodes, a
specialist in special education. "Our friend is gentle, and doesn't
promote violence. If he is representative of Muslims, they are
quality people."</TE>
<TE>   Muslims like Gail Kennard, manager of a Los Angeles architectural
firm, say they are reaching out to their neighbors. The terrorist
attacks prompted her non-Muslim colleagues to begin asking about her
faith for the first time, Kennard said. The questions were
surprisingly basic, with inquiries such as "Do Muslims believe in
God?" and "Do Muslims believe in heaven?" (Yes and yes). Prompted by
the experiences, she invited non-Muslim friends to a Ramadan
fast-breaking meal for the first time last year.</TE>
<TE>   "I realized how misunderstood we have been and that we have a
responsibility to educate our fellow citizens about our values and
heritage," Kennard said.</TE>
<TE>   Among the Muslim community's new friends is Japanese American
activist Kathy Masaoka of Nikkei for Civil Rights and Redress.
Listening to the radio after the terrorist attacks, Masaoka said fears
expressed by Muslims struck an instant emotional chord, reminding her of
her own family's ordeals after Pearl Harbor.  Two weeks after
Sept. 11, she helped organize a candlelight vigil for the
victims of terror and to express support for innocent Muslims, Arabs
and South Asians. Since then, she has helped form a committee to
forge friendships with her community through picnics, dinners,
cultural exchanges and Buddhist-Muslim dialogues.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think they should have to feel responsible for all of the
actions done by others from other countries who don't represent
them," Masaoka said, adding that her Muslim friends have shown her a
faith of compassion and good deeds. "We weren't responsible for Pearl
Harbor, and we don't have to prove our loyalty any more than anyone
else. They shouldn't have to, either."</TE>
<TE>   The contrast between the ostracism on the political level and the
often-positive encounters among individuals has led many Muslim
activists to argue for a shift in where their organizations put their
political energy.</TE>
<TE>   Abdullah, for instance, envisions a new phase of American Muslim
activism focused on showcasing Islam's best ideals of justice and
compassion through involvement in broader community issues of crime,
homelessness and poverty.</TE>
<TE>   Activists like Ayloush say they already have made the switch,
spending far more time on community events than traditional political
ones. "Gaining acceptance in America won't come through ad campaigns
or meetings with elected officials," Ayloush said. "It's by winning
the minds, hearts and trust of our neighbors."</TE>

<HD>Prosecutor Reveals List of 21 Accused Priests</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>A prosecutor took the unusual step of releasing the names of Roman
Catholic priests whom church officials say were accused of sexually
abusing children but have not been charged by authorities.</LD>
<LD>   Bristol County Dist. Atty. Paul Walsh gave out the list of 20
names as he announced the indictment of a priest for allegedly
molesting a girl from 1965 to 1971.</LD>
<LD>   Civil rights advocates criticized Walsh for encouraging a "witch
hunt." Walsh acknowledged his decision goes against standard
prosecutorial policy and appeared to be the first move of its kind by
a prosecutor.</LD>
<TE>   The Fall River diocese turned over a total of 21 names, including
the priest charged Thursday and two priests who are now deceased.</TE>

<LD>Hundreds more foreign doctors would be allowed to stay in the U.S.
under a House-passed measure designed to help communities where
physicians are in short supply.</LD>
<LD>   Foreign medical students who train in the U.S. must return home
for two years under the terms of their visas. However, the government
frequently waives the requirement in exchange for three years of work
in rural areas or other places where attracting doctors is a
struggle.</LD>
<LD>   Each state is allowed to seek 20 waivers annually, but legislation
passed Thursday would boost the number to 30. The provision was part
of a Justice Department budget bill that cleared the House on a 400-4
vote and is pending in the Senate.</LD>

<TE>   A proposal to place a 10-cent tax on espresso drinks sold in
Seattle will appear on the Sept. 16 ballot. The City Council declined
to adopt the initiative as law and instead voted 7 to 1 to send it to
voters.</TE>
<TE>   If the tax passes, the money would be allocated for the city's
preschool and child-care programs, including salaries of teachers and
teachers' aides.</TE>
<TE>   The tax originated with the Economic Opportunity Institute, a

Preliminary research shows that most people in Seattle are in favor
of the tariff, which would be levied on any drink that contains half
an ounce or more of espresso.</TE>

<LD>   Researchers at Boston's Forsyth Institute said their successful
experiment suggests the existence of dental stem cells, which could
one day allow a person to replace a lost or missing tooth with an
identical tooth from his or her own cells.</LD>
<LD>   The research may signal that the days of synthetic dental implants
could be numbered.</LD>
<TE>   The research was due to be published in the Oct. 1 issue of
Journal of Dental Research.</TE>

<HD>A House Divided Among California's Democrats</HD>
<DH>Iraq: Issue of Bush's bid for a military strike is not
splitting the state's congressional contingent neatly along the usual
North-South lines.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JANET HOOK</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Rep. Lynn C. Woolsey (D-Petaluma) is a strong "no" vote on going to
war with Iraq. Rep. Howard L. Berman (D-Mission Hills) is a solid
"yes."</LD>
<LD>   Rep. Ellen O. Tauscher of Alamo, like many other Democrats on
Capitol Hill, wishes the whole issue could be decided after
November's elections. The state's Republican lawmakers, meanwhile,
have raised no qualms about President Bush's Iraq policy.</LD>
<LD>   California's congressional delegation is, in short, a microcosm of
Congress as a whole as it grapples with Bush's request for a
resolution authorizing use of force against Iraq. "The snapshot is:
Republicans are supportive of the president and Democrats are split,"
said Rep. Christopher Cox (R-Newport Beach).</LD>
<TE>   Some of the divisions among the Democrats are predictable: Most
Bay Area liberals are taking a dovish stand; Jewish lawmakers and
defenders of Israel tend to be more hawkish.</TE>
<TE>   But there are some surprises. Sen. Dianne Feinstein--who is
Jewish, a strong supporter of Israel and often a more moderate voice
within her party--has emerged as one of the loudest voices against
rushing to war with Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   Also, unlike many issues in Congress, this is not one that cleaves
the state neatly along North-South lines. In the Bay Area, for
example, two Democrats from neighboring districts take opposing
views: Rep. Tom Lantos of San Mateo is a strong supporter of military
action against Iraq, while Rep. Barbara Lee of Oakland is so
staunchly antiwar that she was the only House member last fall to
vote against authorizing Bush to take military action after the Sept.
11 terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon.</TE>
<TE>   Among the GOP congressional contingent, Cox said that when
Republicans held their weekly luncheon meeting Thursday, there was
unanimous support for the resolution proposed by Bush that would
grant him broad authority to take action against Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   Even the Republican most inclined to stray from the party,
moderate Rep. Stephen Horn of Long Beach, has lined up unequivocally
behind Bush's challenge to Iraq. "The dangers of continued inaction,
of endless dithering, are too frightening to ignore," Horn said in a
recent statement. "We must act to support the president."</TE>
<TE>   Lantos and Berman--perhaps the two most hawkish California
Democrats--are strong supporters of Israel and have long warned of
the threat posed by Iraqi President Saddam Hussein. Berman helped
arrange Thursday's White House meeting with House Democrats and
Republicans sympathetic to Bush's policy.</TE>
<TE>   "Democrats have to remember here that Bush is not the nemesis;
Saddam Hussein is," Berman said recently. "On national security
issues, we just have to remember where the threat to our interests is
coming from."</TE>
<TE>   At the other end of the spectrum is the hard core of staunchly
antiwar California Democrats. Woolsey, Lee, Sam Farr of Carmel, Bob
Filner of San Diego and Diane Watson of Los Angeles helped found the
coalition that organized this month to oppose a preemptive military
strike against Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   Farr, in a commentary scheduled to appear Sunday in the Monterey
County Herald, says the problem with the administration's "war plan"
is that Bush "forgot to tell the American people why the United
States should rush to war now against Iraq."</TE>
<TE>   Also opposing the use of force against Iraq is Rep. Mike Thompson
(D-St. Helena), who left Thursday for a trip to Iraq. He is traveling
with two other antiwar Democrats, Reps. David E. Bonior of Michigan
and Jim McDermott of Washington.</TE>
<TE>   "The classified briefings Congress has been presented to date have
fallen short of bridging the current chasm between a rush to war and
evidence of an immediate threat," Thompson said.</TE>
<TE>   The House's most powerful California Democrat--Minority Whip Nancy
Pelosi of San Francisco--has been a prominent voice of opposition to
Bush, counterbalancing the support he has received from House
Minority Leader Richard A. Gephardt (D-Mo.). Pelosi, who is also the
ranking Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, says she has
seen no evidence of a threat so imminent that Congress is justified
in voting immediately to authorize military force.</TE>
<TE>   California's Democratic senators--Feinstein and Barbara
Boxer--have been critical of the wording in the resolution Bush sent
to Congress this month.</TE>
<TE>   Boxer called Bush's proposal "a blank check" that she would vote
against.</TE>
<TE>   She joined Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle (D-S.D.) on
Wednesday in accusing the Bush administration of politicizing the
debate concerning Iraq and of focusing on the prospects of war to
gain advantage for the GOP in the fall elections.</TE>
<TE>   Feinstein, who often takes less liberal positions than Boxer,
opposes a preemptive, unilateral strike, arguing that the U.S. first
should seek more support from the international community.</TE>
<TE>   "Is use of force the first option or the last option?" Feinstein
said on the Senate floor Wednesday. "In my view, it should be the
last. In my view, working with the international community, doing all
we can to disarm Iraq before jumping to military force, remains an
option."</TE>
<TE>   Tauscher, a moderate Democrat who comes from a district with a
heavy presence of defense industries, also is calling for Congress to
take more time to consider the matter. She has joined Rep. Dennis J.
Kucinich (D-Ohio), a leader of the House's antiwar faction, in
circulating a letter calling for the vote on Iraq to be postponed
until after the elections because she believes the debate is too
politicized.</TE>
<TE>   "It is not in the best interests of our nation, nor is it in the
best interests of either party, for us to challenge each other's
patriotism or our devotion to duty," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Lurking between the committed hawks and doves of the caucus are
many like Tauscher who are unsure about how they will vote on the
issue--in part because they do not know the exact wording of the
resolution that will come before them.</TE>
<TE>   Rep. Brad Sherman (D-Sherman Oaks) said he would rather not
authorize the use of force until a rigorous effort had been made to
return weapon inspectors to Iraq. But if forced to vote on the Bush
resolution as introduced, Sherman said he "leans yes."</TE>

<HD>Little Light Shed on Bush Judicial Pick</HD>
<DH>Hearing: Miguel Estrada assures panel personal views won't
affect bench decisions. Two senators push for more input.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID G. SAVAGE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Washington attorney Miguel Estrada, whose nomination to the U.S.
Court of Appeals has split Latino groups, assured Senate Democrats in
a surprisingly low-key hearing Thursday that his personal and
political views will not affect how he decides cases as a judge.</LD>
<LD>   "Although we all have views on a number of subjects from A to Z,
the first duty of a judge is to put all of that aside," said Estrada,
President Bush's choice for a seat on the evenly divided appeals
court in Washington.</LD>
<LD>   "I'm not worried in the least that anybody could detect any bias
or lack of skill in my legal work," he added.</LD>
<TE>   Estrada's nomination has drawn intense interest because, if
confirmed, he could be in line to be the first Latino chosen for the
Supreme Court.</TE>
<TE>   But Thursday's hearing added little to the little that is already
known about Estrada's legal views.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike most other nominees to the higher courts, Estrada has
virtually no written record--as a judge, law professor or an advocate
on public issues.</TE>
<TE>   Two Democrats, Sens. Charles E. Schumer of New York and Patrick J.
Leahy of Vermont, insisted that the Judiciary Committee needs to see
the memos Estrada wrote while working as a lawyer in the Justice
Department's office of solicitor general.</TE>
<TE>   Department officials refused to release the memos, saying that
internal legal advice is confidential.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm more than happy to convey your request," Estrada replied, but
he added the decision rests with the Justice Department, not him.</TE>
<TE>   Estrada, who turned 41 Wednesday, was born in Honduras, the son of
a lawyer. He came to New York as a teenager and later excelled at
Columbia College and Harvard Law School.</TE>
<TE>   After graduation, he clerked for Supreme Court Justice Anthony M.
Kennedy and served five years in the solicitor general's office,
which represents the government in the high court. He began under the
first Bush administration's Solicitor General Kenneth W. Starr and
stayed on during the Clinton administration.</TE>
<TE>   Since leaving government, he has worked as a lawyer in the
Washington office of the Los Angeles law firm of Gibson, Dunn &amp;
Crutcher. There, he worked with the team of Republican lawyers who
fought to stop the Florida recount in what became the Bush vs. Gore
case.</TE>
<TE>   Soon after taking office, Bush nominated Estrada to the appeals
court in Washington. Estrada has won the support of some Latino
groups and is opposed by others.</TE>
<TE>   The League of United Latin American Citizens, the Latino Coalition
and the U.S. Hispanic Chamber of Commerce endorsed him. The
Congressional Hispanic Caucus and Puerto Rican Legal Defense Fund
opposed him, and the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational
Fund said it had "grave concerns" about his record.</TE>
<TE>   Friends who have worked with him say Estrada is brilliant and has
a penetrating legal mind. His admirers include former Clinton
administration lawyers Ronald Klain and Seth Waxman, a former
solicitor general.</TE>
<TE>   Detractors say Estrada can be acerbic and arrogant in private, and
they believe he will be a rigid conservative if put on the bench.</TE>
<TE>   Estrada admitted Thursday he had described as "boneheaded" a
question from a Puerto Rican lawyer during a meeting with attorneys
from the Puerto Rican Legal Defense Fund.</TE>
<TE>   "By and large, it was a cordial conversation," Estrada said. But
when one of them suggested he was "not sufficiently Hispanic, I found
those comments offensive and boneheaded."</TE>
<TE>   The committee has not said when it will vote on Estrada.</TE>
<TE>   Bush has made it clear that he would like to appoint a Latino to
the high court, a move that could give the GOP a big political boost.
Speaking at a Republican fund-raiser Wednesday, the president lauded
Estrada as a "fine man" and an "excellent lawyer."</TE>
<TE>   Democrats hold a slim 10-9 majority on the Senate Judiciary
Committee, and while they have approved 78 of Bush's judicial
nominees, they have rejected two: Mississippi Judge Charles W.
Pickering and Texas Supreme Court Justice Priscilla Owen.</TE>
<TE>   "The Democratic Senate has acted far faster and far more fairly on
President Bush's judicial nominees than the Republicans did with
President Clinton's nominees," Leahy said Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   The post Estrada hopes to fill is vacant because Republicans
blocked action on two Clinton picks for the court: Washington
attorney Allen Snyder and Harvard law professor Elena Kagan.</TE>

<HD>Debt Relief at Core of Forum, Says IMF</HD>
<DH>Summit: The World Bank's chief is confident G-7 nations
will help aid poorest countries. A slew of anti-globalization
protests still are planned.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>WARREN VIETH and EDDY RAMIREZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>As police officers and globalization protesters prepared for
showdowns in the streets, U.S. and world officials said Thursday that
they were seeking better ways to respond to financial crises in
debt-burdened countries.</LD>
<LD>   The promises and precautions came on the eve of three days of
official meetings and public protests focusing on the increasing
integration of the global economy and the financial interactions of
the world's rich and poor.</LD>
<LD>   U.S. Treasury Secretary Paul H. O'Neill said he would lobby fellow
finance ministers to adopt a new system--already under discussion by
the Group of Seven industrialized nations--for detecting future
financial crises at an early stage, resolving them in a predictable
way and preventing them from spreading.</LD>
<TE>   "A predictable, smooth process for nations that are in
unsustainable situations will ease the chaos the current system
creates in the lives of too many people who have been failed by their
government's inaction," he said.</TE>
<TE>   O'Neill is hosting separate meetings today of Western Hemisphere
and Group of Seven finance ministers, and will participate Saturday
and Sunday in the fall meetings of the World Bank and the
International Monetary Fund.</TE>
<TE>   World Bank president James D. Wolfensohn expressed confidence that
wealthy nations would make good this weekend on an earlier pledge to
provide more debt relief for some of the world's poorest countries.</TE>
<TE>   The Heavily Indebted Poor Country Initiative, which has provided
about $26 billion in debt relief so far, needs at least $800 million
in additional funding, he said, and several countries are nearing
final approval for their donations.</TE>
<TE>   "The G-7 countries have indicated they are prepared to put up
funds to the extent of $1 billion," Wolfensohn said. "We are hopeful
that at these meetings, we'll get an indication from the G-7 of that
support."</TE>
<TE>   IMF Managing Director Horst Koehler said his institution was
already working to improve its abilities to respond to financial
crises and had amended its lending policies to give developing
countries a bigger role in developing programs to reduce poverty.</TE>
<TE>   "My message to our critics, and to the protesters this weekend, is
straightforward," Koehler said. "We share many of your concerns ....
But the objective should not be less globalization, but better
globalization."</TE>
<TE>   But it was a message that went largely unheard among the hundreds
of anti-globalization activists who were already mobilizing for a
variety of rallies, marches, vigils, performances and provocations.</TE>
<TE>   The weekend meetings were expected to attract as many as 10,000
protesters, whose actions will be monitored by about 3,000 police
officers from the District of Columbia and surrounding jurisdictions.</TE>
<TE>   Police were preparing for potential clashes today with militant
globalization foes who advocate confrontational forms of street
protest.</TE>
<TE>   Members of the Anti-Capitalist Convergence said they would attempt
to "shut down" Washington this morning by disrupting traffic at major
intersections and bridges, blocking access to the subway system and
interfering with downtown commerce.</TE>
<TE>   Organizers insisted that their activities would be peaceful, but
left open the possibility that small groups of protesters might stage
more provocative "autonomous actions."</TE>
<TE>   "We support whatever nonviolent, creative resistance tactics that
people feel will get their message across," said Andrew Willis, a
student at American University and a self-described anarchist.</TE>
<TE>   The organizers said one group of activists would participate in a
slow-moving bicycle caravan, while another would march on foot
through the downtown area. Later, protesters planned to participate
in an anti-globalization drum circle, and conduct a group "die-in" on
behalf of potential casualties of a U.S. military offensive in Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   "It's time to raise the stakes," said organizer Zein El-Amine.
"Our direct action is a form of civil disobedience that follows in
the tradition of the Boston Tea Party and the civil rights movement."</TE>
<TE>   A coalition of less confrontational protest groups will stage its
own series of events Saturday and Sunday, including an attempt to
"quarantine" finance officials inside the IMF and World Bank
headquarters.</TE>
<TE>   "We expect D.C. police to do their job and protect the public,"
said Njoki Njoroge Njehu, director of 50 Years Is Enough, one of the
groups planning protests over the weekend. "We don't want Washington
to be destroyed. We want the focus to be on the issues."</TE>

<LD>An Al Qaeda paymaster who disbursed money to the Sept. 11 hijackers
shared a credit card account with Khalid Shaikh Mohammed,
establishing the first known link between the plot and the man U.S.
officials believe conceived it, FBI Director Robert S. Mueller III
told Congress in testimony that was declassified Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   The tie to Mohammed--among the Al Qaeda operatives most wanted by
U.S. officials--was spelled out in a detailed status report on the
investigation of the attacks Mueller presented to lawmakers in June.</LD>
<LD>   The document portrays a plot carried out with such professionalism
and precision that the hijackers "operated without suspicion,
triggering nothing that alerted law enforcement," Mueller said. "To
this day we have found no one in the United States except the actual
hijackers who knew of the plot."</LD>
<TE>   Mueller then noted that Zacarias Moussaoui is the one exception to
his remark. The French-born Islamic militant is in custody in
suburban Washington, accused of being the intended 20th hijacker.</TE>
<TE>   Mueller's written testimony was released Thursday during a hearing
in which two top counter-terrorism officials at the CIA and FBI
defended the performance of their agencies to lawmakers investigating
intelligence failures surrounding Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   The CIA and FBI have come under criticism for missing numerous
clues before the attacks and failing to share key information. Both
officials expressed exasperation with such second-guessing.</TE>
<TE>   The clues highlighted by lawmakers were part of "a maze of
information and a sea of threats," said Dale Watson, who is scheduled
to retire today as counter-terrorism chief at the FBI. "It's a lot
easier to complete a maze if you start at the end."</TE>
<TE>   At one point in Thursday's hearing, the antagonism between
congressional investigators and agency officials surfaced in
embarrassing fashion.</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Pat Roberts (R-Kan.), who has complained that the inquiry is
demoralizing U.S. spy agencies, told witnesses that lawmakers had
been advised in staff briefing materials Thursday that the CIA
official likely would "dissemble," or deceive, when confronted with
certain questions.</TE>
<TE>   "I won't call it shameful, but it's damn close," Roberts said.</TE>
<TE>   Cofer Black, head of the CIA's counter-terrorism center from 1999
through May of this year, reacted with indignation.</TE>
<TE>   "This is so unfortunate," Black told lawmakers. "There's no one
that I know that does counter-terrorism that would dissemble to
representatives of the American people. Something is getting out of
hand here."</TE>
<TE>   In a statement issued later in the day, Eleanor Hill, director of
the investigative staff, said the comment was a "poor choice of
words" and had been included in briefing materials because of an
editing oversight.</TE>
<TE>   Black acknowledged lapses leading up to Sept. 11--including the
agency's failure to put two of the hijackers on State Department
watch lists when they were first linked to Al Qaeda in January 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Doing so might have prevented the men from entering the United
States, or enabled domestic law enforcement officials to locate and
track them after they arrived.</TE>
<TE>   But Black complained that the CIA was hamstrung by a lack of
resources, noting that he was forced to make 30% cuts in
counter-terrorism operations in recent years.</TE>
<TE>   "Before Sept. 11, we did not have enough people, money or
sufficiently flexible rules of engagement," Black said. "After Sept.
11, we did."</TE>
<TE>   Several lawmakers reacted with skepticism, noting that CIA
Director George J. Tenet had declared "war" on Al Qaeda in a 1998
memo and ordered that no expense be spared in the agency. A
congressional aide said later that Congress has boosted
counter-terrorism funding in every year but one since 1994. In 2001,
funding remained flat at the administration's request.</TE>
<TE>   Intelligence funding is poised for a historic increase this year
under a bill passed by the Senate on Wednesday. A congressional
source said the jump is in line with a measure that the House passed
in July calling for an increase of about 25%.</TE>
<TE>   Intelligence budget figures are classified, but are said to have
hovered from $30 billion to $35 billion in recent years.</TE>
<TE>   Through the release of Mueller's testimony, Thursday's hearing
produced a number of new details about the Sept. 11 plot.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities have long focused on Mustafa Ahmed al-Hawsawi as a
primary money man for the hijackers. Mueller said al-Hawsawi was in
the United Arab Emirates "each time the hijackers were transiting" on
their way to the United States to carry out the attacks.</TE>
<TE>   Mueller also gave more details of the hijackers' activities in the
U.S., indicating a professional level of coordination and an
expertise at blending into the population.</TE>
<TE>   Among the other disclosures in Mueller's statement:</TE>
<TE>   * None of the hijackers are known to have used private computers,
laptops "or storage media of any kind," instead using publicly
accessible Internet links at various locations to elude detection.</TE>
<TE>   * Khalid al-Mihdhar, monitored since at least 2000 by the CIA, is
now believed to have been the coordinator and organizer of the 13 men
who were considered to be the "muscle" on the planes.</TE>
<TE>   * The teams of "muscle" operatives arrived in the United States in
pairs, carefully spread out over a period of months and at various
airports in proximity to where others in their cells were living. All
came from the U.A.E., even though they were Saudi Arabian.</TE>
<TE>   * During the summer of 2001, Mohammed Atta--the operational leader
of the plan in the United States--met frequently with another
hijacker who had previously been identified only as a low-level
operative. Mueller said Atta and Nawaf al-Hazmi "appear to have met
face-to-face on a monthly basis to discuss the status of the
operation, and ultimately the final preparations for the attack."</TE>

<HD>Storm Blows Ashore in Louisiana, Leaves Soggy Mess</HD>
<DH>Weather: Isidore had weakened before hitting land, but it
has left a trail of floods and twisters and is breaking up over
Alabama.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LIANNE HART</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>HOUMA, La.</DL>
<LD>When gray daylight returned to this storm-ravaged Cajun country,
Precious Shephard steeled herself to face the soggy apartment she
fled overnight.</LD>
<LD>   Hours before, as water punched through the thin walls, Shephard
had snatched up her baby daughter and paddled to safety in a wooden
canoe.</LD>
<LD>   "When I go back it's going to be stinky and funky," lamented a
puffy-eyed Shephard, 18. "When I left, my shoes were floating in the
living room."</LD>
<TE>   All across the Bayou State, residents awoke Thursday to find that
murky lakes had swallowed their front lawns, torn branches were
strewn recklessly by the wind and thousands of people left their
homes to filthy flood waters.</TE>
<TE>   In the end, Tropical Storm Isidore's threat was harsher than its
attack. By the time it lumbered to land, the aging Isidore was too
weak and weary to call itself a hurricane. But the storm managed to
make a soggy mess of the Gulf Coast just the same, stringing a
northeastern trail of floods and twisters from here to Florida.</TE>
<TE>   Heavy gales toppled electrical lines along the shoreline, cutting
power to at least 140,000 homes and businesses in Louisiana and
Mississippi. Isidore bred a handful of tornadoes that damaged houses
in Florida and police cars in Louisiana. A farmer suffered a broken
leg and collarbone when a tornado crashed into his barn near
Graceville, Fla., Wednesday night.</TE>
<TE>   By Thursday afternoon, a weakened Isidore was downgraded to a
tropical depression and was falling apart over Alabama. Meanwhile, a
soggy Louisiana was busy mopping up. Gov. Mike Foster said the storm
cost the state at least $18 million in damage, including $3.7 million
in lost sugar cane. He said the toll would likely grow, and he was
seeking a federal disaster declaration. There were no immediate
reports of deaths or injuries.</TE>
<TE>   In Houma, more than 600 waterlogged refugees headed home after a
worried stay in a makeshift downtown shelter. "I haven't slept in
three days," said Faye Danos, dragging on a cigarette outside the
shelter. "You don't know how much you can keep going."</TE>
<TE>   Danos lives in Isle de Jean Charles, a tiny and defiant island
community that has been sinking slowly into the Gulf of Mexico for
years. Earlier this week, as Isidore bore closer, Danos and her
teenage children stuffed blankets, pillows and spare clothes into
trash bags, crowded into a neighbor's van and headed for higher
ground.</TE>
<TE>   "Now we can't get back," she said wearily. "The police are keeping
people out."</TE>
<TE>   Water is a way of life in the isolated Cajun marshes of southern
Louisiana, where the land crumbles into islands and swamps before
giving way altogether to the Gulf of Mexico. The swell and recession
of the bayous, the feuding of water and land are familiar phenomena
around here. "We live in a bowl, you know," said Terrebonne Parish
Council Chairman J. D. Breaux.</TE>
<TE>   And on Thursday, there was no argument: The water had won.</TE>
<TE>   In the dim lobby of Houma's A-Bear Hotel, 41-year-old Kusum Patel
slogged disconsolately through thigh-deep water. Toys, brochures and
shoes bobbed in the muddy water. Patel, her husband and their
feverish baby spent a worried dawn on the concrete steps after rising
waters covered the first floor of the old brick hotel. By the time
daylight came, the family's living quarters were submerged.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know what I'm going to do--it's a nightmare," Patel said.
"I'm lost now."</TE>
<TE>   Silty canals coursed in the place of paved streets, and die-hard
residents paddled through their neighborhoods aboard pirogues, wooden
canoes that are a preferred mode of transportation in the marshes of
Louisiana's backwoods. "This is the only way to get around," said
shipyard worker Kenny Darrell, steering his craft toward the highway.</TE>
<TE>   Heavy flooding along Louisiana's coast swamped Port Fourchon, the
central gulf's key landfall for offshore oil and gas production.
"Port Fourchon is, I'm told, a lake right now," Foster told reporters
in Baton Rouge.</TE>
<TE>   In New Orleans, drivers ventured forth at daylight to collect the
beached cars they'd abandoned on the grassy medians of the Garden
District. In the thick of the storm, water rose to windshield height
in some neighborhoods. "I thought my car was safe up here," said Anna
Fariss, studying the hardened mud that gripped her Thunderbird's
tires in place. "But I guess I was wrong."</TE>

<HD>House Clears Bill Limiting Malpractice Awards</HD>
<DH>Health: Democrats are wary of measure being cash cow for
insurers.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The House, responding to doctors' complaints that rising insurance
premiums are forcing them to quit their practices or relocate, passed
a bill Thursday to cap pain-and-suffering damages that juries can
award in malpractice suits.</LD>
<LD>   The 217-203 vote came after a debate over whether limiting large
jury verdicts would ease the insurance crunch felt by doctors and
patients. Its passage is uncertain in the Democrat-controlled Senate,
which already has rejected a similar measure.</LD>
<LD>   "Our nation is galloping toward a health-care crisis of dimensions
we have never faced before," said Rep. Nancy L. Johnson (R-Conn.).
"There are whole states where a woman cannot find an obstetrician
that will take a high-risk pregnancy."</LD>
<TE>   "Very quietly, access to sophisticated high-risk care is declining
in America," she added.</TE>
<TE>   Democrats questioned whether the bill would simply be a cash cow
for insurers after Republicans rejected Democratic attempts to
require that savings be used to lower malpractice insurance premiums.</TE>
<TE>   "They are going to allow the insurance industry to pocket this
money," said Rep. Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.). "That's what it's all
about. It's about the insurance companies, not about physicians."</TE>
<TE>   But Republicans were buoyed by support from the White House,
business groups, insurers and hundreds of physicians.</TE>
<TE>   "This is the moment of truth," said Dr. Donald Palmisano,
president-elect of the American Medical Assn. "Without reforms,
patients, trauma centers, maternity wards and physicians are all at
the mercy of an out-of-control liability system."</TE>
<TE>   The House legislation would limit noneconomic damages, such as
pain and suffering, to $250,000. Punitive damages would be limited to
twice the amount of economic damages awarded or $250,000, whichever
is greater.</TE>
<TE>   Patients' ability to file lawsuits over old cases would be limited
under the legislation, which would also curtail lawyers' fees.</TE>

<HD>U.S. Shows Secret Files by Mistake</HD>
<DH>Terrorism: Moussaoui is given classified FBI reports, but
prosecutors recover them from jail.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>ALEXANDRIA, Va.</DL>
<LD>Accused Sept. 11 conspirator Zacarias Moussaoui was inadvertently
given classified FBI interview reports by the government, and
authorities had to go into his cell and recover them, according to
court papers released Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   The government initially said two classified documents were in
Moussaoui's possession, then acknowledged there were seven before
finally determining there were 48.</LD>
<LD>   After several increasingly anxious letters from prosecutors, U.S.
District Judge Leonie Brinkema allowed U.S. marshals to recover all
the FBI interview reports in Moussaoui's possession. All unclassified
documents were ordered returned to the defendant.</LD>
<TE>   Moussaoui, 34, goes on trial Jan. 6 on charges of conspiring with
the 9/11 hijackers to commit terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   After the searches of his cell began, Moussaoui chided the
government with a "Motion to Expulse the United States from the
Arabian Discovery Cave."</TE>
<TE>   U.S. marshals at one point were unable to recover all the
documents, according to a letter that Assistant U.S. Atty. Robert
Spencer sent the judge Aug. 29.</TE>
<TE>   "Despite their hard work and valiant effort, the Marshal's Service
could not find two of the seven documents. Unfortunately, one of the
remaining two documents is the most critical of the seven," Spencer
wrote.</TE>
<TE>   Brinkema issued an order Thursday that made public the
correspondence on the matter. She said she agreed with Moussaoui's
court-appointed lawyers that the government's letters to the judge
had been kept secret solely to avoid embarrassment to prosecutors.</TE>
<TE>   Further, she said, the government disclosed the classified
materials in a pleading sent to Moussaoui, who is not supposed to see
secret material in his case. The court-appointed lawyers, who assist
Moussaoui while he represents himself, are cleared to see the
material.</TE>
<TE>   The documents "are the property of the United States and the court
has authority to order that the property be returned to the United
States," Spencer wrote the judge Sept. 5.</TE>
<TE>   In a separate letter the same day Spencer wrote, "The defendant
now has access to national security information.... The access to
this material by the defendant is a situation that, even if of our
own making, is improper and unacceptable. Simply put, it is illegal
and dangerous for the defendant to possess the material, and there
must be some way that we can correct the situation."</TE>
<TE>   The judge on Aug. 23 questioned why the government sought to tip
off Moussaoui that the documents were classified because there was no
indication on the records of their secret nature.</TE>

<DH>The Fellowship, which sponsors the National Prayer
Breakfast, quietly effects political change. It acts with the
blessing of many in power.</DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>ARLINGTON, Va.</DL>
<LD>For the last two decades, a Virginia mansion has been a private
hideaway for world leaders, members of Congress, and even pop star
Michael Jackson.</LD>
<LD>   Located on a quiet residential street, the $4.4-million estate
called Cedars sits at the highest point of the Potomac River, with
spectacular views of Washington beyond the pool and tennis courts. It
is owned by the Fellowship, the nonpartisan Christian group that
sponsors the National Prayer Breakfast.</LD>
<LD>   While the annual breakfast is a widely known event attended by a
succession of U.S. presidents and foreign dignitaries, the Fellowship's
part in the breakfast is low-key.  Most attendees think the event is
sponsored by Congress or even the president.  Likewise, the Fellowship's
role in diplomacy and current events has remained in
the shadows. That's the way the organization wants it, for
philosophical and practical reasons.</LD>
<TE>   "If you want to help people, Jesus said you don't do your alms in
public," Douglas Coe, the group's leader, said in a rare interview.</TE>
<TE>   A Los Angeles Times review of the Fellowship's archives, which are
kept at the Billy Graham Center at Wheaton College in Wheaton, Ill.,
and an examination of documents obtained from several presidential
libraries reveals an organization that has had extraordinary access
and significant influence on foreign affairs for the last 50 years.</TE>
<TE>   Eight members of Congress, including Sen. John Ensign (R-Nev.),
live in a grand house on Capitol Hill, which is owned by a sister
organization of the Fellowship. The house, which is registered as a
church, routinely hosts gatherings for lawmakers and ambassadors.
Members of Congress have traveled around the world on the
Fellowship's behalf, sometimes mixing matters of state with religion.</TE>
<TE>   The Fellowship was a behind-the-scenes player at the Camp David
Middle East accords in 1978, working with President Jimmy Carter to
issue a worldwide call to prayer with Israeli Prime Minister Menachem
Begin and Egyptian President Anwar Sadat. During the Cold War, it
helped finance an anti-communism propaganda film endorsed by the CIA
and used by the Pentagon overseas.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, the Fellowship helped arrange a secret meeting at
Cedars between two warring leaders, Democratic Republic of Congo
President Joseph Kabila and Rwandan President Paul Kagame--one of the
first of a series of discreet meetings between the two African
leaders that eventually led to the signing of a peace accord in July.</TE>
<TE>   Then-Sen. David Durenberger retreated to the mansion in 1986 when
he began having marital problems. GOP strategist Lee Atwater came
seeking spiritual guidance in 1990 when he learned he was dying.
Jackson and his children stayed in October, while in town for a
benefit concert for victims of last year's terrorist attacks.</TE>
<TE>   Jackson's visit came about as a result of a call from "a friend
from the White House," Coe said. The call came from David Kuo, deputy
director of the Office of Faith-Based Initiatives, who helped put
together the United We Stand concert. When Kuo learned that Jackson
needed a place to stay, he thought of Cedars. "It's a private unknown
place that offers anonymity in a peaceful environment," he said.
"Part of the whole Fellowship belief is you can help people who are
down and out by helping people who are up and out."</TE>
<TE>   Coe, 73, has befriended a succession of presidents and
world leaders since arriving in Washington in 1959. In April, he was
invited to the White House to speak off the record with employees
about prayer.</TE>
<TE>   Coe said the group's mission is to create a worldwide "family of
friends" by spreading the words of Jesus to those in power. He
believes that people of every religion--including Muslims, Jews and
Hindus--are swayed by Jesus. If he can change leaders' hearts, he
said, then the benefits will flow naturally to the oppressed and
underprivileged.</TE>
<TE>   The Rev. Rob Schenck, founder of Faith and Action in the Nation's
Capital, a Christian outreach center, said that "the mystique of the
Fellowship" has helped it "gain entree into almost impossible places
in the capital."</TE>
<TE>   The Fellowship also has brought controversial figures to
Washington, where they have met with U.S. officials either at the
prayer breakfast or other venues. Among them are former Salvadoran
Gen. Carlos Eugenio Vides Casanova, who in July was found liable by a
civil jury in Florida for the torture of thousands of civilians in
the 1980s. He was invited to the 1984 prayer breakfast, along with
Gen. Gustavo Alvarez Martinez, then the head of the Honduran armed
forces. Alvarez, later linked to the CIA and a secret death squad,
became an evangelical missionary before he was assassinated in 1989.</TE>
<TE>   "The people that are involved in this association of people around
the world are the worst and the best," Coe said. "Some are total
despots. Some are totally religious. You can find what you want to
find."</TE>
<TE>   The Fellowship</TE>
<TE>   The Fellowship is a collection of public officials, business
leaders and religious ministries that defies easy description.
Sometimes known as the prayer group movement, its members espouse a
common devotion to the teachings of Jesus and a belief that peace and
justice can come about through quiet efforts to change individuals,
particularly those in positions of power. Personal outreach is
paramount.</TE>
<TE>   They also share a vow of silence about Fellowship activities. Coe
and others cite biblical admonitions against public displays of good
works, insisting they would not be able to tackle their
diplomatically sensitive missions if they drew public attention.
Members, including congressmen, invoke this secrecy rule when refusing to
discuss just about every aspect of the Fellowship and their involvement in
it.</TE>
<TE>   Jennifer Thornett, a Fellowship employee, went so far as to say
that "there is no such thing as the Fellowship," even as she helped
lead a group of 250 college students around Washington this month,
part of a Fellowship-sponsored national leadership forum on faith and
values.</TE>
<TE>   The group's official name is the Fellowship Foundation, though it
does most of its business as the International Foundation. It is
based in Arlington, in a sleepy neighborhood of upscale houses, many
owned by members of the Fellowship or groups tied to it.</TE>
<TE>   The foundation has nonprofit status under the Internal Revenue
Service code and a board of directors that includes a senator's wife,
a former Air Force assistant secretary, an Education Department
official and the former director of Asian affairs for the National
Security Council. IRS filings show the Fellowship has an annual
budget of $10 million and spends most of that on salaries, the
National Prayer Breakfast, travel for Coe, members of Congress and
others, upkeep of Cedars and a roster of Christian groups worldwide.</TE>
<TE>   Fellowship dollars have gone to an orphanage in India; a program
in Uganda that provides schooling, housing and leadership to
children; the Senate chaplain; a ministry dedicated to professional
golfers; a development group in Peru; and a house in Washington that
serves troubled children. The foundation provides Coe with a house on
the grounds of Cedars, a minimal salary and annual expenses, which
have ranged from $110,955 in 1995 to zero in 2000. The foundation
also employs his two sons, who each earned $93,000, according to IRS
filings for 2000.</TE>
<TE>   The Fellowship does not solicit money. A handful of wealthy
backers, including Detroit lawyer and GOP donor Michael Timmis,
Denver oilman Jerome A. Lewis and former Maryland investor Paul N.
Temple, support the Fellowship with personal contributions. Private
foundations they control also contribute hundreds of thousands yearly
to the International Foundation, tax records show.</TE>
<TE>   Other money has come through word of mouth, stock bequests, and
donations from friends, estates and even foreign governments
including Taiwan, which Coe said sends about $10,000 a year to the
Fellowship. He said the ambassador usually delivers the check in
person.</TE>
<TE>   International diplomacy has been part of the Fellowship from the
beginning. The group was begun by Abraham Vereide, a Methodist
evangelist who feared that Socialists were corrupting municipal
government in Seattle in the mid-1930s. He thought he could bring
about change by organizing regular prayer groups with local business
and government leaders.</TE>
<TE>   He took his idea to Washington, D.C., in 1942. A small group of
House members began praying together. A Senate group followed.
Vereide believed that the small prayer groups could be used to help
establish personal contacts with leaders throughout the world.</TE>
<TE>   Pentagon officials secretly met at the group's
Washington Fellowship House in 1955 to plan a worldwide anti-communism
propaganda campaign endorsed by the CIA, documents from the
Fellowship archives and the Eisenhower Presidential Library show.
Then known as International Christian Leadership, the group financed a
film called "Militant Liberty" that was used by the Pentagon abroad.</TE>
<TE>   Intimate prayer groups begun by the Fellowship still meet
regularly and privately, at the House of Representatives, Senate and
throughout federal agencies in Washington. President Eisenhower,
persuaded by his campaign manager, became the first U.S. president to
attend a prayer breakfast in 1953--part of what the Senate chaplain
at the time called a "Return-to-God Movement." Every president since
has made an appearance at least once, turning the breakfast into a
worldwide attraction for the prayerful and political alike.</TE>
<TE>   Similar prayer breakfasts, begun by followers of the
Fellowship and hosted by governors and mayors, are now popular
throughout the U.S. The Fellowship lured Coe to Washington as Vereide's
understudy in 1959. When Vereide died 10 years later, Coe essentially took
over.</TE>
<TE>   Under Coe, the group dropped the word Christian from its official
name. "Doug gives an overarching leadership to this whole vision of
working with leaders," said Bob Hunter, a former insurance official
in the Ford and Carter administrations who has been involved with the
Fellowship for years, especially in Africa. "He has so many contacts
now. Everyone knows him."</TE>
<TE>   Former President Bush once referred to Coe as "an ambassador of
faith." If Coe is an ambassador, Cedars is his embassy. The
Fellowship bought the mansion, complete with furnishings, for $1.5
million in 1978.</TE>
<TE>   The white-column mansion was once owned by George Mason IV, one of
three men who refused to sign the U.S. Constitution and an original
drafter of the Bill of Rights. Reclusive billionaire Howard Hughes
lived there for a stretch before the Fellowship bought it.</TE>
<TE>   Coe described Cedars as a place "committed to the care of the
underprivileged, even though it looks very wealthy." He noted that
people might say, "Why don't you sell a chandelier and help poor
people?" Answering his own question, Coe said, "The people who come
here have tremendous influence over kids." Private Fellowship
documents indicate that Cedars was purchased so that "people
throughout the world who carry heavy responsibilities could meet in
Washington to think together, plan together and pray together about
personal and public problems and opportunities."</TE>
<TE>   The Fellowship likes to embrace the fallen. One minister recalled
seeing former United Way chief William Aramony at Cedars the night
Aramony learned he was facing criminal charges for embezzling charity
money.</TE>
<TE>   Coe described Cedars as a place open to anyone, including the
poor, but acknowledged that the poor who most often use the estate
are the young men and women from foreign countries who make the beds,
tend the manicured gardens, serve gourmet meals and learn about the
Fellowship.</TE>
<TE>   The women live in a separate house across the street. The men live
in another house called Ivanwald down the block. Several years after
purchasing Cedars, members of the Fellowship began buying up houses
in this affluent neighborhood.</TE>
<TE>   "This thing grew organically," said Fellowship member Chris
Halverson, son of Richard Halverson, the late Senate chaplain who was
one of the Fellowship's leaders. "More and more people were needed to
do the work of helping these senators."</TE>
<TE>   The Breakfast</TE>
<TE>   Today thousands of government officials, international leaders and
select business executives meet on the first Thursday of every
February for 90 minutes of prayer, granola, fresh fruit, bagels,
pastries, coffee and juice.</TE>
<TE>   More than 8,000 people from 170 countries were invited to the
National Prayer Breakfast this year; about 3,000 accepted. Tickets
are $425. The embossed invitation comes from "members of the Congress
of the United States of America." It asks guests to join the
president, vice president "and other national leaders in the
executive, judicial and legislative branches of our government" for a
morning of prayer.</TE>
<TE>   Presidential seals decorate nearly everything at the event,
from the podium, to the registration desk, to the official program. It's
not surprising that many think it's an official government event.</TE>
<TE>   Kit Webb, a Virginia businesswoman, attended this year's breakfast
at the Washington Hilton hotel. "It's the government leaders who
invited everyone," declared Webb, as she mingled in the lobby with
other guests. "It's owned by Congress." The Fellowship doesn't go out
of its way to correct the record. In fact, Coe, ever secretive, goes
so far as to assert that the Fellowship doesn't sponsor the event:
"If the International Foundation put it on, would all these people
come?" he asked. But the Foundation's role is detailed in private
papers and tax records, where it informs the IRS that it "sponsors
the National Prayer Breakfast," spending $742,604 to put it on in
2000.</TE>
<TE>   An informal congressional committee, made up of members of the
House and Senate who meet once a week in small prayer groups, acts as
the official host and prepares the program.</TE>
<TE>   Rabbi Samuel Cohon of Tucson, who attended this year's breakfast,
said he was surprised at how overwhelmingly Christian it was, given
its government veneer. He told his Jewish congregation he was
disappointed that no other religion besides Christianity was
acknowledged.</TE>
<TE>   "I believe that most interfaith prayer services would have been
much more sensitive than this National Prayer Breakfast, under the
auspices of our elected leadership, managed to be," Cohon said.</TE>
<TE>   The Fellowship pays for those foreign guests, particularly from
poorer countries such as India, Pakistan and Afghanistan, who can't
afford to make it to the breakfast on their own. Many foreign leaders
who attend the breakfast get to schmooze with members of Congress and
other U.S. officials while they are in town, people they might not
ordinarily have access to. Some of the leaders issue news releases
back home, declaring that they have been invited to meet with the
U.S. president.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm sure a lot of people use the Fellowship as a way to network,
a way to gain entree to all sorts of people. And entree they do get,"
said Michael Cromartie, director of the Evangelical Studies project
at the Ethics and Public Policy Center, a conservative
Washington-based think tank. He has attended every breakfast since
1975.</TE>
<TE>   Coe said the Fellowship does not help foreign dignitaries gain
access to U.S. officials. "We never make any commitment, ever, to
arrange special meetings with the president, vice president or
secretary of State," Coe said. "We would never do it."</TE>
<TE>   The archives tell another story.</TE>
<TE>   During the Reagan era, prayer breakfast organizers made sure the
president met the international leaders who were there.</TE>
<TE>   Among those who met with President Reagan were a controversial
faith healer and spiritual advisor to the president of Zambia, a
presidential candidate from El Salvador who was not favored by the
U.S. administration, and the king of Tonga.</TE>
<TE>   "Doug Coe or someone who worked with him would call and say, 'So
and so would like to have a word with the president. Do you think you
could arrange something?' " said G. Philip Hughes, the executive
secretary for the National Security Council in the first Bush
administration. "It's an opportunity to put in a plug for something
or inch a ball forward."</TE>
<TE>   At Senate Foreign Relations Committee confirmation hearings for
incoming State Department officials last year, Sen. Bill Nelson
(D-Fla.), whose wife, Grace, is on the board of the Fellowship,
complained that the State Department blocked President Bush from
meeting privately at the 2001 prayer breakfast with heads of state
from Rwanda, Macedonia, Congo and Slovakia.</TE>
<TE>   "Well, if I might observe, I'm not sure a head of state ought to
be able to wander over here for the prayer breakfast and, in effect,
compel the president of the United States to meet with him as a
consequence," replied Sen. Paul S. Sarbanes (D-Md.). "I mean, getting
these meetings with the president is a process that's usually very
carefully vetted and worked up. Now sort of this back door has sort
of evolved."</TE>
<TE>   While none of the visiting heads of state met with Bush,
Democratic Republic of Congo President Kabila and Rwandan President
Kagame privately met for about an hour in the living room on the
first floor of Cedars. It was the first time the two warring leaders
had met face to face.</TE>
<TE>   They sat on salmon-colored couches across from a marbled
fireplace, their aides and bodyguards banished to another room.</TE>
<TE>   Kabila's father, the former president, had been murdered the month
before. Rwanda had 30,000 soldiers within Congo's borders. Starvation
and civil war had racked Congo for three years, leaving 2 million
dead and an economy in ruins as rebels tried to gain control.</TE>
<TE>   "It was an important meeting," said Richard Sezibera, Rwanda's
ambassador to the U.S. In the months that followed, members of the
Fellowship reached out to both leaders, visiting them in Africa. The
two men finally signed a peace accord in July in a deal brokered by
the president of South Africa--a move that could be an important step
toward peace.</TE>
<TE>   "The fact that they met here probably saved hundreds of thousands
of kids," Coe said.</TE>
<TE>   Douglas Johnston, who heads the International Center for Religion
&amp; Diplomacy in Washington and is a former Fellowship board member,
said faith-based diplomacy is the hallmark of the Fellowship. He said
the Fellowship has kept its actions low-key because people might
wrongly assume it is crossing the line of church-state separation.</TE>
<TE>   "People forget what separation of church and state is supposed to
be all about," he said. "Freedom of religion is not freedom from
religion."</TE>
<TE>   Church and State</TE>
<TE>   A four-story townhouse on C Street, two blocks from the Capitol,
is owned by a sister organization of the Fellowship, and is
registered with the IRS and the District of Columbia as a church. It
pays no taxes. Yet eight members of Congress live there.</TE>
<TE>   "We sort of don't talk to the press about the house," said Rep.
Bart Stupak (D-Mich.), who lives there. The 8,000-square-foot
detached townhouse has 12 bedrooms, nine bathrooms, five living rooms
(including one with a big-screen TV), four dining rooms, three
offices, a kitchen--and a small chapel. "The C Street property is a
church," said Chip Grange, an attorney for the Fellowship. "It is
zoned as a church. There are prayer meetings, fellowship meetings,
evangelical meetings," he said. "Our mission field is Capitol Hill."</TE>
<TE>   But at least one member of Congress who lives there, Rep.
Michael F. Doyle (D-Pa.), said he didn't know the property was registered
as a church. Doyle would not comment further. "I don't discuss my
personal living arrangements with the media," he said. Rep. Zach Wamp
(R-Tenn.), another townhouse occupant, told Associated Press in 2000
that the house was the most popular place on the Hill to watch NCAA
basketball, eat takeout Chinese food and discuss public policy. The
story did not mention the Fellowship. "That's my own life and my own
relationships," Wamp told The Times.</TE>
<TE>   The house is also conveniently located for conducting faith-based
diplomacy. The Rev. Louis P. Sheldon, chairman of the conservative
Traditional Values Coalition, said he recently met with several
ambassadors from West Africa at the C Street house.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a real hideaway for congressmen and senators and ambassadors,"
said Sheldon, who has been associated with the Fellowship for decades.</TE>
<TE>   He said the Fellowship opened the C Street house to members of
Congress because "it helps them out. A lot of men don't have an extra
$1,500 to rent an apartment. So the Fellowship house does that for
those who are part of the Fellowship." Rent is $600 per month for
each resident. Meals cost extra, but cleaning is provided by eight
college-age volunteers from the Fellowship and a "house mother" who
washes the congressmen's sheets and towels.</TE>
<TE>   Besides Stupak, Wamp and Doyle, residents include Nevada's Ensign
and Reps. Ed Bryant (R-Tenn.), John Elias Baldacci (D-Maine) and
James DeMint (R-S.C.). Former Rep. Steve Largent (R-Okla.) lived
there until he left Congress to run for governor.</TE>
<TE>   The Fellowship has given C Street Center $450,000 in grants and
loans since 1994, IRS records show.</TE>
<TE>   The group has offered financial aid to congressmen in other ways
too. When the late Sen. Harold Hughes' daughter died in 1976, the
Fellowship paid funeral expenses. Hughes left the Senate to become a
full-time member of the Fellowship. When former Sen. Mark Hatfield
needed money in the 1970s, the Fellowship loaned him thousands, gave
him $10,000 as an honorarium, and arranged for a lucrative deal to
rent property he owned in Oregon--arrangements later criticized by
the board. "We would never do it today," said board President Richard
Carver, assistant secretary of the Air Force in the Reagan
administration.</TE>
<TE>   Coe, who also loaned money to Hatfield, said he has loaned money
to other members of Congress, but did not recall the details. "I give
or loan money to hundreds of people, or have my friends do so," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   The Fellowship has paid for overseas trips by congressmen in its
ranks, who sometimes mix diplomacy and religion during meetings with
foreign heads of state. Coe has been dispatched to foreign
governments with the blessing of congressional representatives. He
has also helped arrange meetings overseas for U.S. officials and
members of Congress. In 1979, for instance, Coe messaged the Saudi
Arabian minister of commerce and asked him to meet with a Defense
Department official who was visiting Riyadh, the capital.</TE>
<TE>   In January, Reps. Frank R. Wolf (R-Va.), Tony P. Hall (D-Ohio) and
Joseph R. Pitts (R-Pa.) traveled to Afghanistan and Pakistan on a
fact-finding congressional trip, meeting with the leaders of both
Muslim countries. But the men, all members of the Fellowship,
discussed more than U.S. policy.</TE>
<TE>   "The first thing we did when we met with [Afghan] President
[Hamid] Karzai and President [Pervez] Musharraf was to say, 'We're
here officially representing the Congress; we'll report back to the
speaker, our leaders, our committees, our government. But we're here
also because we're best friends.... We're members of the same prayer
group,' " Pitts recalled in a recent interview with his college
alumni magazine, the Asbury College Ambassador.</TE>
<TE>   "We meet every week together around the teachings of Jesus and we
pray together," he said. "We told them about the National Prayer
Breakfast and we invited them to join us."</TE>
<TE>   Even in the politically sensitive environment after Sept.
11, 2001, Islamic scholars say that most Muslims would react positively
to the words of Jesus--unless he was referred to as the son of God.
Nevertheless, the Rev. Barry Lynn, executive director of Americans
United for Separation of Church and State, says he is "skeptical
about religious diplomacy ... in the long run, someone is going to
start trying to convert people."</TE>
<TE>   Elliot Mincberg, legal director of People for the American Way, a
liberal advocacy group, said, "It would be better for a member of
Congress to separate those roles." Coe said he too would rather that
members of Congress who travel overseas keep their public lives
distinct from the work they do on behalf of the Fellowship. "I think
you need to keep the two hats separate," he said.</TE>
<TE>   But he dismisses concerns about the Fellowship's heralding of
Jesus. "Religion is divisive. The ideas of Jesus are cohesive," Coe
said. "That is the single most important thing I've learned in the
last 50 years."</TE>
<TE>   Some of the members of Congress most active in the Fellowship
overseas also are key members of official congressional committees
that oversee the State Department and foreign aid. Wolf is chairman
of the House appropriations panel that oversees the State Department
budget. Pitts is a member of the House International Relations
Committee.</TE>
<TE>   Max Kampelman, a former ambassador who is now chairman of the
American Academy of Diplomacy, says proselytizing can backfire by
antagonizing the other party.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't feel that is an effective diplomatic tool," he said.</TE>
<TE>   But in his book "Religion, the Missing Dimension of Statecraft,"
former Fellowship board member Johnston argues that the absence of
religion in international diplomacy has led to "uninformed policy
choices." The book argues, for instance, that the U.S. failed to see
the importance of Islamic clerics in countries such as Iran, which
hampered foreign policy decision-making in the Middle East.</TE>
<TE>   The book was inspired by the Fellowship and its back-channel
diplomacy. In an illustration of the group's unusual diplomatic
status, Johnston describes how members of the Fellowship traveling in
Somalia in 1981 met with its president, who told them he was willing
to meet with the president of Kenya "in the spirit of Christ" to
avoid bloodshed. They recounted the story to Air Force Gen. David
Jones, then chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and a Fellowship
member, when they returned.</TE>
<TE>   Sometime later, the Somali president paid an official visit to
Jones at the Pentagon. Jones invited him to a Fellowship breakfast,
attended by some members of Congress, Coe and other Defense
Department officials.</TE>
<TE>   Again, they encouraged him to meet the Kenyan president. "You must
go. What if the meeting could take place in secrecy? What if separate
helicopters could bring each of you to an American aircraft carrier
for a rendezvous at sea? No one would have to know about it," Jones
said at the breakfast, Johnston wrote. Within a month, the two
presidents met--albeit without help from the U.S. military.</TE>
<TE>   Such private missions trouble some watchdogs. "You're combining on
some level religion and politics," said Chuck Lewis, executive
director of the Center for Public Integrity in Washington.</TE>
<TE>   "When our most powerful and senior officials are operating abroad,
under an aegis that is something other than their government titles,
they are somehow less than accountable. That is valuable for a
citizen to know."</TE>
<TE>   While in Congress, Hall traveled to Lebanon, Greece, Britain,
Slovenia, Japan and India on trips paid for by the Fellowship. Hall
said he met with "mostly ordinary people" overseas, though as a
courtesy, he often called on heads of state and the U.S. ambassador
in that country. He said if the conversation turned to politics, he
tried to turn it back to Jesus, and the idea of praying for those in
power to become better people by loving God.</TE>
<TE>   "When a personal bond is formed, then you're able to work on
issues like human rights and hunger," said Hall, who resigned his
congressional seat this month to become U.S. ambassador to the United
Nations on hunger issues. The president of the Fellowship board also
stepped down to work with Hall in his new job in Rome.</TE>
<TE>   "There's nothing sinister here, no dark secrets," Hall said. "It's
the exact opposite of what Washington is about."</TE>

<HD>Business Reform Hopes Dim</HD>
<DH>Congress: The focus on a possible war with Iraq may imperil
measures to bolster workers' pensions and to seek new rules dealing
with corporate corruption.</DH>

<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The brewing face-off with Iraq may have claimed its first casualty:
more corporate reform legislation.</LD>
<LD>   Prospects for a bevy of measures designed to strengthen
protections for workers' pensions and impose new rules of corporate
behavior appear to be dimming, in part because of Washington's
preoccupation with President Bush's aggressive new stance toward
Iraqi President Saddam Hussein.</LD>
<LD>   Corporate corruption remains a potent political issue. Bush on
Thursday put the spotlight back on the issue, taking time from his
initiative against Hussein to tout his efforts to root out corporate
crime.</LD>
<TE>   "We are making broad and dramatic progress against corporate fraud
in America," Bush said in a speech to federal prosecutors. He cited
more than 100 investigations into suspected corporate fraud.</TE>
<TE>   He also called on the Democrat-controlled Senate to pass a pension
reform bill. "Right now, too many workers are locked into plans that
force them to hold a large portion of their accounts in a company's
stock," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Congress passed a landmark accounting reform bill in late July in
response to scandals at Enron Corp., WorldCom Inc. and other big
companies. And as they broke for the summer, lawmakers promised to
follow up with other measures, such as overhauling pension laws,
cracking down on offshore tax havens, requiring companies to expense
stock options and closing a loophole that allows dishonest executives
to keep their multimillion-dollar mansions.</TE>
<TE>   The measures have been stalled by shifting legislative priorities,
such as the possibility of war, by aggressive lobbying by business to
head off more regulation and by heightened election-year tensions.</TE>
<TE>   The obstacles are looming larger as the November vote nears.</TE>
<TE>   "For these kinds of bills to pass, serious compromises would have
to be made," said Patrick Bashman, a senior fellow at the libertarian
Cato Institute think tank. "But compromise becomes a four-letter word
in the partisanship-centered weeks prior to a tightly contested
election."</TE>
<TE>   Bryan Jones, a political science professor at the University of
Washington, said the Iraq issue has "completely displaced" corporate
reform. "I doubt that anything else serious is going to get done," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   Political analysts say the pressure on Congress to do more also
has eased.</TE>
<TE>   Larry Sabato, a University of Virginia political scientist, said
lawmakers can point to their passage of the accounting reform bill
"and claim to have done something this session about corporate
irresponsibility."</TE>
<TE>   Some analysts say Congress still might complete work on the other
major piece of legislation spurred by Enron's collapse: new
safeguards for workers' 401(k) retirement accounts. Enron workers
suffered huge losses when the company stock, which made up a large
part of their retirement accounts, plummeted.</TE>
<TE>   Said Robert Litan, director of economic studies for the Brookings
Institution, a nonpartisan think tank: "This was the issue that most
resonated with the average American, and I would think that few
congressmen running for reelection would want to tell their
constituents that they had not eased their fears about being unable
to sell company stock in 401(k) plans."</TE>
<TE>   Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle (D-S.D.) said Thursday he still
hopes to bring a pension reform bill to the Senate floor before
Congress adjourns in mid-October. "We're not giving up," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The GOP-controlled House this year passed a bill that would give
employees new rights to sell company stock and diversify investments
in their 401(k) accounts.</TE>
<TE>   But Democrats who control the Senate have said the House measure
doesn't go far enough.</TE>
<TE>   Complicating the picture, Democrats disagree among themselves over
what should be included in the legislation.</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.) has pushed for provisions that
would require employee representation on pension boards and limit
companies to offering their own stock as a matching contribution or
as an investment option, but not both.</TE>
<TE>   Some of his Democratic colleagues oppose those provisions.</TE>
<TE>   Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) said Thursday he remains determined to
push a requirement for companies to account for stock options on
their books, a proposal blocked from the accounting reform bill
approved this year.</TE>
<TE>   "If a pension bill comes up, you'll see that amendment," he vowed.</TE>
<TE>   Also, any pension reform measure is likely to attract other
initiatives, such as business tax breaks and an increase in the
minimum wage--issues that would make it more difficult to pass a
measure before Congress adjourns.</TE>
<TE>   McCain acknowledged the uncertainty over whether a pension bill
will clear Congress this year.</TE>
<TE>   "We're running out of time."</TE>
<TE>   Efforts to close a loophole that could allow executives of
scandal-tainted companies to declare bankruptcy and keep their
multimillion-dollar homes has been stymied by a dispute over an
unrelated issue.</TE>
<TE>   Sponsors of the measure to close the so-called homestead exemption
promise to persevere, despite the ticking legislative clock.</TE>
<TE>   "It would be a miscarriage of justice to permit the year to end
without addressing the most scandalous abuse of the bankruptcy laws
in an era when numerous corporate executives will surely use the
homestead exemption to protect millions of dollars from their
creditors," said Sen. Herbert Kohl (D-Wis.).</TE>

<HD>5 Die in Nebraska Bank Holdup</HD>
<DH>Violence: Three suspects are arrested. Rural crime is
rising, with towns seen as 'easy marks.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEPHANIE SIMON and ERIC SLATER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>NORFOLK, Neb.</DL>
<LD>This farm community of 24,000, set amid cornfields and cattle ranges,
is a big city by Nebraska standards. Yet not big enough to absorb the
horror of a botched robbery Thursday morning that left five people
dead in a bloodstained bank.</LD>
<LD>   It was the nation's deadliest bank heist in more than a decade,
and though it left residents shaken, experts said the tragedy is yet
another indication of crime's growing reach into rural America.</LD>
<LD>   Police Chief Bill Mizner choked up as he read aloud the names of
the victims--four bank employees and a customer--killed as three
robbers shot their way out of the U.S. Bank branch near one of the
town's busiest intersections.</LD>
<TE>   "Evone Tuttle, 37, of Stanton," Mizner read. "Lola Elwood, 43. Jo
A. Mausbach of Humphrey. Lisa J. Bryant."</TE>
<TE>   The chief paused for a long awkward moment.</TE>
<TE>   "Lisa J. Bryant, 29, of Norfolk," he continued with difficulty.
"Samuel C. Sun, 50."</TE>
<TE>   He seemed shaken by his own emotion. "Sorry about that," he said.</TE>
<TE>   On a day of leaden skies, when heavy clouds pressed hard against a
desolate horizon, Norfolk residents expressed sorrow, rage, fear and,
above all, a sense of betrayal.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm angry. I'm just angry. I know this stuff happens all over the
world, but it doesn't happen in Norfolk, Neb.," said Dan Kuester, 45,
who grew up in a farm town near here and returned to raise his
children in the peace of rural life after two decades of
globe-trotting with the Army.</TE>
<TE>   "I guess we're naive about these things," said his wife, Carla. "I
feel stupid for feeling that it couldn't happen out here."</TE>
<TE>   The three men suspected in the robbery were captured several hours
after the holdup at a McDon-ald's about 75 miles northwest of
Norfolk.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities said the suspects left the bank on foot, stole a white
Subaru Outback from a nearby residence, drove it into the countryside
then ditched it in a pond. They allegedly then stole a pickup truck
to continue their getaway.</TE>
<TE>   Just hours after the suspects were taken into custody, Madison
County prosecutor Joe Smith said he would file five first-degree
murder charges against each of the men. "Everyone is absolutely
committed that the people [killed] here will get justice."</TE>
<TE>   He identified the suspects as Jose Sandoval, Jorge Galindo and
Erick Fernando Vela. But he could offer few other details--not their
ages, their hometowns or any information about weapons they might
have been carrying. And late Thursday night authorities said they
were searching for a fourth man in the case.</TE>
<TE>   The fourth man was identified by the Nebraska State Patrol as
Gabriel Rodriguez, 26. The agency's statement didn't say what role he
is believed to have played in the robbery, and calls to the patrol
for elaboration weren't returned Thursday night.</TE>
<TE>   Facts about the robbery itself were slow to emerge. One witness
said the men were wearing stocking caps. Another witness screamed in
horror as a stray bullet pierced the drive-through window of a nearby
Burger King. And a local radio station reported that bank employees
might have triggered a silent alarm that sealed the doors shut,
forcing the robbers to shoot their way out.</TE>
<TE>   But authorities would confirm none of those rumors. They would not
even comment on whether the gunmen escaped with any money.</TE>
<TE>   As dozens of federal, state and local investigators swarmed the
stucco-and-glass bank, officials would say only that they needed to
review the bank's security camera tapes and interview
survivors--including two employees and a customer who was wounded in
the shoulder--before they could reconstruct the tragedy.</TE>
<TE>   For local residents, it was enough just to know that their quiet
town had been violated.</TE>
<TE>   "We'll probably be locking our doors more after this," one
lifelong resident said.</TE>
<TE>   But the bloody robbery here did not surprise criminologists.</TE>
<TE>   "Small towns are seen as easy marks," said Ralph Weisheit, a
professor of criminal justice at Illinois State University who
specializes in rural violence.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, cash-strapped towns across the heartland have been paring
down or even eliminating local police departments, relying instead on
distant sheriff's deputies to provide protection. Though Norfolk has
its own Police Department, some smaller towns have pooled their
resources to hire a single part-time officer, Weisheit said--"so
he'll work in this town on Tuesday and that one on Wednesday and
another one on Thursday."</TE>
<TE>   The result: Nearly 1 in 3 bank robberies unfolded in a small town
last year. In the mid-1990s, fewer than 1 in 5 robberies occurred in
rural areas.</TE>
<TE>   Tiny towns of just 400 or 500 residents have been hit repeatedly
as robbers learn which banks have security guards and cameras, and
which don't.</TE>
<TE>   Slightly bigger, but still isolated, communities such as Norfolk
are increasingly at risk as well. In fact, FBI statistics show that
on a per-capita basis, towns with populations between 10,000 and
25,000 are now the most likely to experience a bank robbery.</TE>
<TE>   Many small towns also are reporting a surge in other types of
crimes, especially burglaries. A tavern in tiny Sterling, Neb.,
population 507, lost its theft insurance coverage after it was hit
twice in the span of a year and a half.</TE>
<TE>   Nearby towns have reported break-ins at Main Street lumber yards
and grocery stores, and at schools and cafes. The take may be small
by big-city standards--a big-screen TV, perhaps, or a few hundred
dollars--but to locals accustomed to leaving their keys in their
cars, any crime is unsettling.</TE>
<TE>   "Clearly, crime has become an issue to them when it wasn't an
issue before," Allen Curtis, director of the Nebraska Crime
Commission, said recently.</TE>
<TE>   Dan Bodony, the bank robbery coordinator at the FBI's Los Angeles
office, said rural banks are aware that robbers consider them "softer
targets" than urban banks; in recent years, many have taken steps to
improve security.</TE>
<TE>   After a spate of robberies outside Lincoln, Neb., several years
ago, for instance, several banks closed their lobbies and conducted
transactions only through the bulletproof glass of their
drive-through teller windows.</TE>
<TE>   "They are being very proactive when it comes to their security,"
Bodony said.</TE>
<TE>   Many banks are also sending their employees to workshops on how to
handle an attempted robbery. The Workplace Trauma Center, based in
Maryland, teaches tellers how to breathe to slow their heart rate and
avoid panicking. It has them repeatedly practice opening safes while
a trainer holds a fake gun to their head.</TE>
<TE>   Such courses always emphasize that most robbers do not want to
harm anyone. Their aim is usually to take the money and run.</TE>
<TE>   But that truism has been shaken in recent years as bank robberies
nationwide have turned more violent, and as small-town crime has been
increasingly fueled by the drug methamphetamine.</TE>
<TE>   Known as "poor man's cocaine," methamphetamine has swept the
heartland in the last several years. Addicts can brew it themselves
in remote fields and ramshackle trailers, in motel rooms and pickup
trucks. And when they're high, they are often besieged by paranoid
hallucinations that can twist them into brutality.</TE>
<TE>   Methamphetamine is considered such an urgent problem here that 12
Midwest governors met last week in Iowa to swap horror stories about
the drug and to share law enforcement tips.</TE>
<TE>   There is no indication yet that methamphetamine had anything to do
with Thursday's tragedy. But several analysts said the possibility
came to mind as soon as they heard of the bloodbath in Norfolk.</TE>
<TE>   "Drugs are a big driver behind this type of crime," said George
Beattie, executive vice president of the Nebraska Bankers Assn.</TE>
<TE>   As investigators work to unravel what happened at U.S. Bank on
Thursday, Norfolk residents are mourning the five victims--and their
sense of lost security.</TE>
<TE>   "There's a big difference between just robbing the bank and doing
what they did," said Lester Felger, 45, a former manager of the U.S.
Bank branch that was involved in the holdup.</TE>
<TE>   On most days, the town police blotter registers nothing more
serious than a stolen car stereo, a vandalized truck or a suspected
shoplifting of $13.96 worth of merchandise from the HyVee market. Now
there will be five funerals to attend, five shattered families to
console.</TE>

<HD>Ashcroft Fights Limits Imposed on Wiretaps</HD>
<DH>Law: A secretive spy court 'wholly exceeded' its authority
when it rejected guidelines on terrorism investigations, Justice
Dept. says.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The Justice Department aggressively urged an appeals panel for the
nation's secretive spy court to reconsider limits on special wiretaps
for terrorists and spies.</LD>
<LD>   The legal filings, made public Thursday, are part of a fight
within the government to balance new surveillance powers against
citizen rights.</LD>
<LD>   In the documents signed by Atty. Gen. John Ashcroft, the
government said the U.S. Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act court
raised "significant constitutional questions" when it rejected some
of Ashcroft's post-Sept. 11 guidelines for terrorism and espionage
investigations.</LD>
<TE>   The May 17 ruling was the first substantial defeat for the
government in the spy court.</TE>
<TE>   The court, charged with overseeing sensitive law enforcement
surveillance, was "attempting to impose rules for the operation of
the executive branch and structure the functions of different units
with the executive branch," Justice lawyers wrote in an 80-page
brief.</TE>
<TE>   They charged that the spy court "wholly exceeded" its authority
and "acted impermissibly by exercising and undermining ... uniquely
executive powers."</TE>
<TE>   Justice lawyers also accused the court of "judicial excesses" by
raising questions whether to approve some secret wiretaps and
physical searches, adding that courts generally should defer to the
judgment of the FBI director when he decides that secret surveillance
is necessary.</TE>
<TE>   Justice lawyers renewed their arguments that Ashcroft's new
guidelines were permitted under the USA Patriot Act. That law, passed
one month after the terrorist attacks against New York and the
Pentagon, made it easier for U.S. investigators to employ secret
wiretaps and physical searches under a 1978 surveillance law.</TE>
<TE>   The changes permit such wiretaps when collecting information about
foreign spies or terrorists as "a significant purpose," rather than
"the purpose," of an investigation. Critics at the time said they
feared the government might use the change as a loophole to employ
espionage wiretaps in common criminal investigations.</TE>
<TE>   The Justice Department's legal papers, filed Wednesday night,
responded to questions raised Sept. 9 by the appeals panel that
suggest some skepticism about the Bush administration's arguments.</TE>
<TE>   The appeals judges wanted to know why they should disregard a 1980
ruling requiring government to show that its "primary purpose" in
using a secret wiretap is to collect espionage information, not build
a criminal case.</TE>
<TE>   Justice lawyers argued that such a requirement could allow
terrorists and spies to escape the attention of investigators.</TE>
<TE>   " ...[T]here is a strong argument that the 'primary purpose' test
is too strict," Justice lawyers wrote.</TE>

<HD>Letter Describes Torricelli Donor as 'Credible'</HD>
<DH>Politics: Court filing had found 'corroborating evidence'
in gifts case.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL>NEWARK, N.J.</DL>
<LD>Federal prosecutors described allegations made by businessman David
Chang against Sen. Robert Torricelli as "credible in most material
respects," even though the New Jersey Democrat wasn't charged,
according to a letter unsealed Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   The prosecutors filed the letter under court seal before Chang was
sentenced May 23 to 18 months in prison for funneling $53,700
illegally to Torricelli, who is in a dead heat with Republican
candidate Douglas Forrester in his bid for reelection. Torricelli has
called Chang a liar whose statements can't be trusted.</LD>
<LD>   Torricelli has admitted that on three occasions he accepted gifts
from Chang that he did not report under Senate rules, including a
television set and two pairs of earrings. He has denied receiving any
other gifts.</LD>
<TE>   Chang provided accurate information that led to the conviction of
Kenneth Quinones, a U.S. State Department employee, for exchanging
influence for cash and gifts, according to the letter. Prosecutors
requested leniency for Chang. The details Chang provided about
Torricelli soliciting cash and gifts led them to uncover "substantial
corroborating evidence," the prosecutors said.</TE>
<TE>   "Although the government did not ultimately bring a prosecution
against the public official, the government also found Chang's
statements concerning the conduct of the public official to be
credible in most material respects," prosecutors wrote to U.S.
District Judge Alfred Wolin.</TE>
<TE>   Torricelli tried unsuccessfully to block release of the letter. A
U.S. Court of Appeals ruled Thursday against the senator.</TE>
<TE>   Torricelli said he fought to keep the sentencing memo private in
part because he believes he has been unfairly treated by the media
and he feared statements from it would be taken out of context.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors declined in January to charge Torricelli and referred
the case to the Senate ethics committee, which "severely admonished"
him on July 30.</TE>

<DL>YORK, Pa.</DL>
<LD>An all-white jury was seated Thursday in the trial of three white men
charged with murder in the shooting death of a young black woman
during York's 1969 race riots.</LD>
<LD>   The jurors were selected from within York County, which is about
93% white. The city of York, about 85 miles west of Philadelphia, is
about 25% black.</LD>
<LD>   Former Mayor Charlie Robertson is among those on trial. Robertson,
then a police officer, is accused of inciting white gang members and
handing out ammunition to at least one of the shooters.</LD>
<TE>   Two other defendants face up to life in prison if convicted.</TE>

<HD>Study Links Ecstasy's Effect to Parkinson's</HD>
<DH>Health: Animal tests show the party drug can lead to severe
brain damage and disease symptoms such as loss of motor skills.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Even one typical night's use of the club drug Ecstasy may damage
nerve cells in the brain responsible for movement, increasing the
risk of Parkinson's disease and similar disorders, researchers report
today.</LD>
<LD>   The findings were based on animal studies in which monkeys and
baboons were given the kinds of doses that users might consume at
all-night dance parties. The animals suffered profound neurological
damage, according to results published in the journal Science, and
lost 60% to 80% of the brain cells that transmit dopamine, a brain
chemical that regulates movement.</LD>
<LD>   "We've never seen an effect of this magnitude before, and we were
surprised that one session caused this much damage," said Dr. George
A. Ricaurte, a study coauthor and a neurologist at the Johns Hopkins
School of Medicine in Baltimore.</LD>
<TE>   Ecstasy gained popularity in the '90s as part of the rave club
scene, and young partygoers sometimes take three or four doses over
several hours.</TE>
<TE>   Previous animal studies had shown that the drug damages as much as
30% to 40% of serotonin neurons, which produce a brain chemical that
regulates mood and behavior. This depletion may account for the
emotional letdown habitual users often experience after weekend
Ecstasy binges, experts say.</TE>
<TE>   The drug's effect on dopamine was twice as severe, which is
worrisome because it may predispose even occasional users to
neurological problems, the researchers said. Because there is only
one known case of an Ecstasy user having movement problems, the lack
of obvious or immediate harmful effects contributes to "the
misperception that Ecstasy is a safe drug," Ricaurte said.</TE>
<TE>   But Parkinson's symptoms usually don't emerge until individuals
lose more than 80% to 90% of their dopamine neurons. Because dopamine
levels decline as people age, Ecstasy users may be placing themselves
at risk of developing symptoms of the motor disorder, Ricaurte said.</TE>
<TE>   Some scientists, however, said the findings might not apply to
humans.</TE>
<TE>   "This study is seriously flawed and the interpretation
misleading," said Dr. Charles S. Grob, director of the division of
child and adolescent psychiatry at Harbor-UCLA Medical Center in
Torrance. The animals in the experiment were injected with Ecstasy,
and that can be much more toxic than ingesting the drug orally, which
is how it is normally used, he said.</TE>
<TE>   And while illicit street use is "dangerous because the drug is
often adulterated with harmful compounds," he said, any possible
brain cell damage is probably not permanent.</TE>
<TE>   Researchers said the next step is to determine the drug's
neurological effect on humans. Scientists at Johns Hopkins are doing
brain imaging scans on habitual Ecstasy users to see if they have
dopamine and serotonin deficits, but test results aren't yet
available.</TE>
<TE>   Still, this is an important study because it demonstrates Ecstasy
may seriously damage two key systems in the brain, those controlling
movement and mood, said Alan I. Leshner, chief executive of the
American Assn. for the Advancement of Science, which publishes
Science, and former director of the National Institute on Drug Abuse
in Bethesda, Md.</TE>
<TE>   "This should send a clear message that trying Ecstasy for even one
night is like playing Russian roulette with your brain," Leshner
said.</TE>
<TE>   The study was funded by the U.S. Public Health Service.</TE>

<HD>Discovery Brings Hope to Sufferers of Harsh Digestive
Disorder</HD>
<DH>Science: Celiac disease severely limits the diet of those
afflicted and leads to painful symptoms. An oral treatment may now be
possible.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROSIE MESTEL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Scientists say they have pinpointed the cause of a common,
debilitating disease of the gut that affects more than a million
Americans, a finding that could lead to the first effective therapy
for the disorder.</LD>
<LD>   People with celiac disease--also known as celiac sprue or
gluten-sensitive enteropathy--cannot eat foods containing wheat, rye
or barley. If they do, they face severe discomfort, vomiting,
diarrhea, malnutrition and even death. A new therapy could allow
victims to lead a much more normal life.</LD>
<LD>   Researchers at Stanford University and the University of Oslo in
Norway report in today's Science that they found a small protein
fragment in the cereal grains that triggers an immune reaction in
celiac patients. The fragment is a portion of a protein known as
gluten.</LD>
<TE>   Though most proteins are quickly chopped up by digestive juices,
this gluten fragment persists--permitting inflammation to develop in
the guts of susceptible people. They found that the fragment is not
present in grains that can be consumed safely by celiac patients.</TE>
<TE>   The team also identified a bacterial enzyme that can chop up the
protein, offering the promise that a pill might one day be developed
to prevent celiac symptoms.</TE>
<TE>   This might allow celiac patients to eat at least some
gluten-containing items, much as a person with intolerance to the
milk sugar lactose can now swallow a lactose-digesting pill to
consume an ice cream cone.</TE>
<TE>   "If it does work ... it could be a very rapid and effective
therapy," said Dr. Damian Augustyn, chief of gastroenterology and
hepatology at California Pacific Medical Center in San Francisco.
"Gluten is present in so many food products, and patients have to be
so careful to exclude it. Inevitably they're not 100% successful."</TE>
<TE>   But Augustyn and other experts caution that the idea of an oral
supplement, while intriguing, faces many tests before its promise can
be assessed.</TE>
<TE>   Celiac disease is a poorly understood genetically linked condition
in which the patient's immune system attacks the small intestine when
it is exposed to gluten. The result is inflammation and a progressive
loss of the tiny brushlike folds that allow food to be efficiently
absorbed.</TE>
<TE>   Typically diagnosed in children, it is increasingly being
diagnosed in adults. The ailment can lead to anemia and loss of bone
mass, and even a slightly heightened risk of certain cancers, if
untreated.</TE>
<TE>   Frequently, it can take months or years for a correct diagnosis to
be made. Once identified, the only treatment is the strict avoidance
of dietary gluten--by eschewing all products containing wheat, barley
and rye.</TE>
<TE>   The connection with gluten was first recognized in the 1940s, when
a Dutch pediatrician noticed that children with the illness fared
better under wartime rations, when cereal supplies were short--only
to relapse when grains were reintroduced. The disorder was
subsequently found to be genetic, and researchers have linked some
gene variants to it.</TE>
<TE>   In today's paper, Stanford chemist Chaitan Khosla and his
colleagues bathed various pieces of gluten protein in human digestive
juices and found that one fragment, just 33 amino acids long,
persisted for many hours while the other pieces were destroyed. Rats
were also unable to digest it.</TE>
<TE>   The fragment was also shown to activate immune cells in the guts
of 14 patients with celiac sprue, a key step in producing disease
symptoms.</TE>
<TE>   Developing an oral supplement that could digest this fragment
could make the lives of people with celiac disease much easier, said
Khosla, whose wife and 6-year-old son suffer from the ailment.</TE>
<TE>   "This is not some kind of boutique disorder--nor is it a minor
nuisance," he said. "The burden of disease is truly enormous on a
patient."</TE>
<TE>   Celiac patients must avoid many more foods than the obvious breads
and pastas. Gluten can be present in everything from soy sauce and
seasoned salt to turkey meat, cottage cheese and soups.</TE>
<TE>   Khosla and colleagues are planning a small trial in which healthy
adult patients with the ailment will be given the enzyme--known as a
peptidase--to see if it improves their gluten tolerance.</TE>
<TE>   If that works, said Khosla, many more steps would be needed before
a pill could be developed. For instance, it would have to be tested
for safety and its ability to survive sufficiently long in the gut.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it'd be cool. It would be nice to eat normal bread and
pizza and not have to question everything," said Bay Area resident
Molly Duncan Stone, 12, who was diagnosed with celiac disease as a
toddler after she stopped walking, talking and playing and began
losing weight precipitously.</TE>
<TE>   Now thriving on a gluten-free diet, she has learned to read
labels, bake her own pizza and cookies to take to birthday parties,
and was pleased to receive a gluten-free cookbook as a Christmas
present.</TE>
<TE>   Recently, dining with friends, all she dared eat was an egg.</TE>
<TE>   Today's paper represents a key step forward in understanding
celiac disease, said Dr. Martin Kagnoff, professor of medicine and
director of the laboratory of mucosal immunology at UC San Diego. But
many mysteries remain.</TE>
<TE>   For instance, Kagnoff said, although celiac disease is associated
with a certain gene, only 2 of 100 people carrying that gene get the
disease. "The other 98% don't--and the question is why."</TE>

<HD>Anti-HIV Find Is Revealed--and Quickly Disputed</HD>
<DH>Science: A family of proteins blocks replication of the
virus, researchers say. Others fault the study's methods and
conclusion.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>THOMAS H. MAUGH II</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>New York researchers report today that they have identified a
mysterious and long-sought family of proteins that protect some
people infected with HIV from progressing to AIDS, but their report
has drawn quick criticism from others involved in the search.</LD>
<LD>   Dr. David Ho and his colleagues at the Aaron Diamond AIDS Research
Center say that a group of three proteins called alpha-defensins are
produced in the white blood cells of so-called long-term
non-progressors and that these proteins block the replication of HIV
in the test tube.</LD>
<LD>   If their findings are correct, it would open the door to a new
approach to therapy that would not involve the use of powerful yet
toxic drugs.</LD>
<TE>   But other researchers say Ho is wrong.</TE>
<TE>   "We have looked at defensins in the past," said Dr. Jay Levy of UC
San Francisco, who was the first to recognize the presence of a
protein that blocks HIV replication in non-progressors and who has
spent the last 16 years searching for it. "It is not defensins."</TE>
<TE>   "I guarantee you that their interpretation of their data is
wrong," added Dr. Robert Gallo, head of the Institute of Human
Virology in Baltimore, who was a co-discoverer of the AIDS virus. In
fact, Gallo says, he has identified the protein sought by Levy and
others in his own lab but has delayed publication until his team can
document its properties more thoroughly.</TE>
<TE>   Levy said his team also is "very close" to identifying the elusive
factor, which he calls CD8 antiviral factor, or CAF. Defensins, he
said, may have a small anti-HIV effect, but they do not have the
properties that would be expected for CAF.</TE>
<TE>   The entire argument over whether defensins are CAF may, in fact,
be irrelevant, added Dr. Robert Lehrer of UCLA, whose team discovered
defensins in 1985. "Does it matter what you call it, or does it
matter what it is and what it does?" he said. "Is this a possible
explanation for why some people are better defended against HIV than
others? Probably."</TE>
<TE>   An estimated 5% to 10% of people who are infected by HIV are able
to naturally suppress viral replication and never develop AIDS
symptoms. Researchers know how they do it in many cases. Some people
lack a receptor on immune cells called CCR-5, which allows HIV to
bind to and infect the cells. Others have certain combinations of
so-called histocompatibility, or HLA, antigens that seem to preclude
progression. Some have white blood cells that produce a combination
of chemicals called beta-chemokines, identified by Gallo in 1995,
that inhibit viral replication.</TE>
<TE>   "What's most important is that these factors vary enormously ...
from one long-term non-progressor to another," Gallo said. "There is
no single answer."</TE>
<TE>   Most of those factors do not offer new opportunities for therapy,
but CAF would seem to do so if it could be identified. Levy first
postulated its existence more than 15 years ago, demonstrating that
white blood cells called CD8 cells taken from non-progressors secrete
a protein that blocks HIV replication.</TE>
<TE>   But "it is very difficult to find a small amount of a protein that
is mixed in with thousands of others," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Ho, Linqi Zhang and their colleagues used a protein analysis
system created by Ciphergen Biosystems of Fremont, Calif., to fish
out three proteins produced by CD8 cells grown in culture. Together,
the three proteins sharply inhibited replication of HIV in the test
tube, they are expected to report today in the online version of
Science at www.scienceexpress.org.</TE>
<TE>   After isolating and characterizing the proteins, they concluded
that they were identical to three previously known proteins called
alpha-defensin-1, -2 and -3. These proteins, found in primates, help
protect against many types of viral and bacterial infections.
Anecdotal reports suggest that some researchers have tried to use
defensins against HIV infections, but very little has been
published--often a sign that they did not see any startling activity.</TE>
<TE>   Dr. Michael Selsted of UC Irvine, one of the co-discoverers of
defensins, questioned the results because the proteins have been
shown to be produced by many types of immune cells, but never by CD8
cells. Selsted, Gallo and others argue that the defensins isolated by
Ho and Zhang may actually have been produced by other cells that the
researchers added to the CD8 cells to help them grow.</TE>
<TE>   "They should have demonstrated that CD8 cells synthesize
defensins," he said. "It was not done. I am amazed that [the paper's]
reviewers did not demand that experiment."</TE>
<TE>   Levy and others also noted that the antiviral activity reported
for the defensins is much smaller than that previously associated
with CAF. "It's not a robust antiviral effect," he argued.</TE>
<TE>   For the time being, then, it remains unclear whether Ho has found
the ultimate protective agent in non-progressors or just one of many.</TE>
<TE>   As he said at a news conference Thursday: "This is not going to be
the ultimate solution, but simply another weapon we could use in our
arsenal against HIV."</TE>

<HD>A Trust Betrayed in Physics</HD>
<DH>Science: In the latest lab disgrace, the scientist had
gained a faithful following. Too faithful?</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBERT LEE HOTZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>It seemed almost too good to be true.</LD>
<LD>   Late last year, scientists at Bell Labs discovered a way to
construct a transistor out of a single molecule. The man behind it
all was Jan Hendrik Schon, a 32-year-old physicist who seemed
destined to win a Nobel Prize one day.</LD>
<LD>   But Schon's discovery was exposed as a fake Tuesday, and now his
case is raising troubling questions about how well the community of
physics--whose work is the foundation of key military, industrial and
commercial developments--can police itself.</LD>
<TE>   Schon's dismissal from Bell Labs casts a shadow on what many
consider the fastest-moving research area in science today--a field
that holds the promise of entirely new approaches to computing and
new industries to capitalize on them.</TE>
<TE>   Physics, like all fields of science, is an enterprise that
traffics in facts but is sustained by faith in its own integrity.</TE>
<TE>   The Schon case is the second major instance of research misconduct
to come to light this year. In July, officials at the Lawrence
Berkeley National Laboratory admitted that the stunning discovery of
a new element was fabricated.</TE>
<TE>   Some experts say many physicists are too trusting or simply
unwilling to look too closely at research practices. The peer-review
process meant to guarantee scientific integrity is too much the paper
tiger, they say, too easily influenced by a researcher's reputation.</TE>
<TE>   The extensive pattern of misconduct in the Schon case also
highlights the responsibility of other scientists who lend their
names as co-workers to the research papers that are published. They
share in the discovery and take some credit for it, yet often they
may not be able to vouch for all the work that went into an
experiment.</TE>
<TE>   "The physics community may be less on guard and more willing to
take results on trust," said Yale University science historian Daniel
Kevles, who has written extensively on research misconduct.</TE>
<TE>   Mostly, however, scientists are asking themselves just how Schon
thought his fabrications would withstand sustained scrutiny.</TE>
<TE>   "I am absolutely mystified about what made him think he could get
away with such a thing," said Caltech physicist and Vice Provost
David Goodstein. "This is high-profile stuff that people would want
to build on to make new advances."</TE>
<TE>   Schon had been recruited to join Bell Labs by Bertram Batlogg, one
of the most prominent physicists in the world. Batlogg, then head of
Bell Labs' materials physics research department, was looking for an
experimental wizard to study the possibility of building organic
transistors--vanishingly small electronic components based not on
silicon but carbon.</TE>
<TE>   These organic, molecule-sized components were seen as the next
breakthrough technology to replace silicon circuits, which are
approaching their physical limits for miniaturization. Chips made of
organic materials, like plastics, could lead not only to vastly more
powerful computers but also a host of new uses, such as flexible
electronic displays.</TE>
<TE>   The problem was trying to make something on such a small scale.
Many researchers had tried and failed miserably.</TE>
<TE>   But Schon eventually began publishing breakthrough papers that
described a method of transforming organic crystals into electronic
components.</TE>
<TE>   At the height of his success barely a year ago, almost everybody
at Bell Labs admired Schon's modest and unpretentious style.</TE>
<TE>   They lauded his deep grasp of condensed-matter physics and
solid-state devices. He worked long hours in the lab too, they said,
always wiring up new samples of the exotic materials that were the
subject of his experiments.</TE>
<TE>   Most of all, they were dazzled by his ability to write such clear,
coherent research papers at such a remarkable rate--one paper every
eight days last year. He and his colleagues churned out more than 90
papers since 1998.</TE>
<TE>   His findings sent an entire field of physics buzzing. The company
that employed him did not shy from trumpeting his success. "This work
pushes the miniaturization of electronics to its final frontier,"
Federico Capasso, a Bell Labs vice president, said in a news release
on one of Schon's discoveries.</TE>
<TE>   His most startling discovery was the creation of a transistor made
of just one molecule.</TE>
<TE>   The device was built by cooking organic molecules in a beaker and
pouring them onto a layer of gold atoms. The molecules assembled
themselves into a pattern allowing them to function as transistors,
the key components of modern electronics. A top layer of gold atoms
completed the construction.</TE>
<TE>   This and all his findings were peer-reviewed by panels of other
scientists and published in the world's leading research journals,
such as Science and Nature.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, one of his papers published in Science in February 2000
was one of the most cited physics papers that year, according to the
Institute for Scientific Information.</TE>
<TE>   "I was blown out of my chair by his work," said UCLA chemistry
professor James Heath, a leader in the field of nanostructures, or
structures on a molecular scale. "I thought it was just amazing. He
had a pretty grand run for two years.</TE>
<TE>   "We tried to do experiments inspired by his findings," Heath said.
"Our results were not as inspired as his. Groups tried very hard to
reproduce these results and fell on their face trying to do it."</TE>
<TE>   No one was trying to disprove Schon's work at first. Rather, they
sought to emulate and build on it. A new field of molecular computing
was taking shape and everyone wanted to be among its founders.</TE>
<TE>   Lab after lab tried and failed to duplicate the experiments,
however, and the buzz about Schon's brilliance took a disquieting
turn starting in the summer of 2001.</TE>
<TE>   Then several researchers noticed that the graphs published in
support of several different experiments were suspiciously alike.</TE>
<TE>   By last spring, awe had turned to doubt. The whispers gave voice
to formal allegations of fraud.</TE>
<TE>   All universities that conduct publicly funded research are
required to have policies and procedures for investigating research
fraud. Bell Labs, however, is a corporate enterprise.</TE>
<TE>   There appears to have been no public money involved in Schon's
work, several researchers said, so federal fraud investigators had no
reason to become involved.</TE>
<TE>   In May, Bell Labs organized its own committee of outside experts
to investigate the problem. Allegations of fraud and misconduct had
been leveled at 25 published research papers involving 20 scientists.
The questions, however, involved less than a quarter of Schon's
publications over the past five years. Many of his unchallenged
papers also claimed significant breakthroughs.</TE>
<TE>   When the five investigators--themselves prominent scientists and
academics--started asking questions, they found that those who had
spoken most glowingly of the young researcher acknowledged that they
actually knew almost nothing about the experiments he had performed.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, in a field known for its collaborations and collegiality,
Schon made almost all his discoveries alone, they learned. Although
his papers bore the names of many scientists, none directly
participated in the breakthroughs, the committee determined.</TE>
<TE>   Schon had conducted many of his most controversial experiments not
at Bell Labs but at the University of Konstanz in Germany, where he
was awaiting his entry visa to the United States.</TE>
<TE>   "Working in isolation is a really unusual thing to do in an
industrial lab," said Heath at UCLA.</TE>
<TE>   In interviews with Schon, the investigating committee members
found themselves weighing questions of superconductivity in
polythiophene and debating fine points of unipolar inverters, load
kinks and ring oscillators.</TE>
<TE>   The Bell investigators eventually found that all his electronic
data files had been deleted. More tellingly, perhaps, there were no
laboratory records, such as signed notebooks, dated sheets of
experimental data or logs, like those most scientists are accustomed
to maintaining.</TE>
<TE>   All the hundreds of devices that Schon said he had worked on were
supposedly damaged during experiments, broken when being moved to his
new lab or simply discarded. He readily admitted that he substituted
and altered data to make the results look better. Some of the
substitutions, he said, were honest mistakes. But he told the panel:
"I truly believe that the reported scientific effects are real,
exciting and worth working for."</TE>
<TE>   There were so many such mistakes, the investigators said, that it
showed a "deeper problem."</TE>
<TE>   Schon could not be reached Thursday to review the report's
conclusions.</TE>
<TE>   Several experts said that Schon's dismissal is proof that the
system of scientific checks and balances is working. The process,
they said, caught up with him.</TE>
<TE>   But when a scientific truth is revealed to be a lie in disguise,
the impact goes well beyond one researcher's career.</TE>
<TE>   The known facts of a scientific discipline have to be reordered.
Promising avenues of research instantly become blind alleys.</TE>
<TE>   "This revelation of misconduct is quite problematic since a number
of individuals have sought to direct their research into what
appeared to be a promising direction," said Harvard University
chemist Charles Lieber, an authority in the new field of
nanotechnology.</TE>
<TE>   "This could have some negative impact on nanoscience and
nanotechnology," Lieber said. "But overall there is too much good
work being done to condemn the field for one bad apple."</TE>
