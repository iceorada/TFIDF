<LD>It's a busy Saturday night at a Century City hotel. "Sex and the
City" star Kim Cattrall fields questions about human rights, while a
woman in an ankle-length black velvet coat is shouting into her
headset, "Sen. Boxer's people--where are you? We gotta go! We're six
minutes out! Where's Sen. Boxer? Where's the governor? We're out of
time!"</LD>
<LD>   Senators and TV stars are sharing the spotlight at the annual
banquet for Human rights Campaign Los Angeles, a lesbian and gay
political organization honoring Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle
and "Sex and the City" creator Darren Star.</LD>
<LD>   Gov. Gray Davis is there on the stump, fresh from the state
Democratic Party convention in downtown Los Angeles. While he huddles
backstage with HRC's executive director Elizabeth Birch, his press
officer distributes fliers detailing the governor's long support of
domestic partnership legislation. Later, he tells the crowd: "We'll
respect your dignity ... no matter who you love."</LD>
<TE>   After a booming speech on equality and the need for hate crimes
legislation, Daschle is swarmed. Sen. Barbara Boxer (D-California) is
among the first to embrace the Democrat from South Dakota. "You have
brought light to our state today," she says. A reporter corners him
on the pending campaign finance legislation package. Will the
Republican opposition prevail? "They have done everything to stop it
for a long time, but I think we've got the votes to stop them," he
says. Then Daschle is asked to pose with Ellen DeGeneres. A few
tables away, Bruce Vilanch wears a faded T-shirt: "Out of My Mind.
Back in Five Minutes."</TE>
<TE>   Star stands outside of the crowd, musing on the fact that he was
honored at the same event as the Senate leader. "It feels a little
out of context, but I'm extremely honored," he says. "I think
Hollywood is always star-struck by Washington."</TE>
<TE>   Elsewhere, Hollywood and Washington intersected Saturday night.</TE>
<TE>   Robert Reich had spoken, and now guests at Stanley Sheinbaum's
fund-raiser to support the former Labor Department Secretary's run
for governor of Massachusetts, went about their business of meeting
and greeting.</TE>
<TE>   Warren Beatty talked politics. So did Mike Farrell.</TE>
<TE>   A woman handed her business card to Annette Bening, pitching yet
another worthy cause. Still, the actress didn't feel overwhelmed. "I
don't feel like I go to a lot of things," she said. "I'm really
selective."</TE>
<TE>   Nearby, salonista Arianna Huffington and author Marc Cooper held
court as self-help guru Marianne Williamson offered Reich her
support. Perched on a couch, the author of "A Return to Love" said
she thought the former Clinton cabinet member could help "make this
world a better place."</TE>
<TE>   She had come to the party with Democratic Congressman Dennis J.
Kucinich, of Ohio, who is also trying to make the world a better
place. His business card promises: "Visionary Leadership for a New
America."</TE>
<TE>   Guests had paid between $100 and $500 for their chance to hobnob
with politicians and Hollywood folk. "We don't believe in keeping
people out just because they're not rich," said one of the
organizers.</TE>
<TE>   The event raised about $40,000. After the party, octogenarian
Sheinbaum relaxed on his couch as staff cleared the living room of
his home. He looked a tad tired. Not surprisingly. He's been doing
salons and fund-raisers for 20 years. He said, joking: "I'm a 107
years old."</TE>
<TE>   DNA Tests Planned in Rodman Lawsuit</TE>
<TE>   DNA testing is being arranged this week in the $10-million civil
lawsuit filed against Dennis Rodman by actress Tina New, who claims
in the suit the former basketball player kidnapped, drugged and raped
her in 1999.</TE>
<TE>   An Orange County Superior Court judge on Feb. 11 granted New's
request to have her dress and underwear tested for Rodman's DNA in an
attempt to prove that he sexually assaulted her during a late night
party at his Newport Beach home. Results are expected in two months.</TE>
<TE>   The clothing has been preserved by the Newport Beach Police
Department, which conducted a criminal investigation of the incident,
New's attorney Stephen Tornay said. He contends that the clothing
wasn't tested for DNA evidence by police. Police found no evidence of
rape at the time New reported it the alleged incident. No criminal
charges were filed.</TE>
<TE>   Rodman, 40, has claimed that he has never met New. "The allegation
is untrue," his attorney Paul Meyer said. "The police determined it
to be unfounded. It is an abuse of the court in an attempt to get
money from a celebrity athlete." Trial is set for Sept. 23.</TE>
<TE>   The incident allegedly occurred during the wee hours of Aug.
20,1999, after New and Rodman met at the Buzz at the Beach nightclub
in Newport Beach, according to the lawsuit. When the club closed
around 2 a.m., one of Rodman's friends allegedly grabbed New by the
arm and forced her into a car driven by Rodman.At the house, New
drank two shots of what she thought was alcohol, offered to her by
Rodman and "became disoriented extremely fatigued and sleepy," the
suit states. She fell asleep in a bedroom and awoke several hours
later to find Rodman naked and attempting to have sex with her. When
she refused his advances, he became violent, according to the suit.</TE>
<TE>   The next morning, New relayed the experience to two friends and a
rape crisis counselor, but she waited 10 days to call the police, her
attorney Tornay said. "She said she was scared of who [Rodman] was,"
he said. "She was going through a custody battle at the time." He
added she was worried her ex-husband Darryl would use the incident as
reason to deny her custody.</TE>

<HD>Amid Ex-Enron Chief's Troubles, a Rocky Mountain High</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIMI AVINS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>ASPEN, Colo.</DL>
<LD>Five days before former Enron Corp. Chairman Kenneth L. Lay took a
verbal whipping from members of the Senate Commerce Committee, a
3,015-square-foot home he and his wife, Linda, bought in 1991 for
$1.95 million sold for a soothing $10 million.</LD>
<LD>   The Lays had planned to retire to the cozy retreat they called
"the cottage." One of their grandchildren was baptized there, and
they'd celebrated a son's wedding in the yard, which borders the
Roaring Fork River, a scenic stream that meanders around the village
of Aspen and through some of its most desirable residential areas.
Now the Lay cottage, an architecturally undistinguished product of
the 1950s, is someone else's tear-down: Brad Bell, executive producer
and head writer of a CBS soap opera, could replace the house with
something bold and beautiful.</LD>
<LD>   "In Minneapolis or Cincinnati, people would make some improvements
on a house like that. But here, someone paid $10 million for the
dirt," said Bruce Carlson, an investor who has lived here for 32
years. "The buyer will probably scrape the house and build a pretty
nice place for another $10 million."</LD>
<TE>   The Lays, who are often described as unpretentious, collected some
rarefied Rocky Mountain dirt. Before the collapse of Enron and the
specter of stratospheric legal bills mandated some quick
de-accessioning, the couple owned three houses and a lot here, in
addition to property in Houston, where they are based, and Galveston,
Texas. Besides the cottage on Shady Lane, they are also selling a
4,537-square-foot house for which they paid $4.825 million in
November 1999 (list price: $6.125 million) and a slightly larger
house across the street, for which they paid $6.145 million in August
2000 (list price: $6.150 million). A 3-acre lot in a subdivision of
$5-million homes that face the ski runs of Ajax Mountain sold for
more than $2 million on Feb. 12, the day Lay, 59, was in Washington
exercising his 5th Amendment right against self-incrimination.</TE>
<TE>   Midwestern merchant princes, Wall Street power lords, Texas oil
barons, Hollywood knights and Bel-Air trust fund princesses have been
coming to Aspen, a once-booming silver mining town nestled 8,000 feet
above sea level, since the 1950s. As luxury playgrounds go, Aspen has
it all: spectacular natural beauty, athletic diversions,
sophisticated restaurants and a range of intellectual pursuits and
cultural activities, crowned by a summer music festival. What other
American ski burg has Chanel, Gucci, Prada, Fendi, Bulgari, Louis
Vuitton, Dior and Baccarat boutiques? The Alpine Bank automated
teller machine at the foot of Aspen Mountain's Silver Queen Gondola
spits out crisp, new $100 bills so anyone getting $500 of pocket
change won't be burdened by a messy wad of twenties.</TE>
<TE>   Among its other charms, Aspen, which has only 6,000 year-round
residents, has become known as a smart place to invest in real
estate. "I've been selling property in Aspen for 25 years," said
Carol Dopkin of Carol Dopkin Real Estate Inc. "People who have
significant wealth are comfortable parking it here, because
historically, they haven't lost their principal and in the last few
years there's been dramatic appreciation. There have been modest
downturns of 10 or 15%, but most of the time it just goes up. And
that's particularly true in the high end of the market."</TE>
<TE>   Here, that means prices that soar higher than big hair in Texas:
The average home price is $3.6 million. In November, Priceline. com
Inc. chief executive Richard S. Braddock paid $22 million for a house
on Red Mountain, not far from where Leslie Wexner, billionaire
founder of the Limited, just closed the deal on a $15-million lot.
Wexner already had a mansion on the hill, but the additional property
will ensure his privacy.</TE>
<TE>   Such extravagance notwithstanding, even Aspen has its version of
hard times. Shopkeepers complain that business is down, and realtors
admit there are too few buyers for a swollen inventory of pricey
homes. Anyone house shopping in the $5-million-to-$8-million
neighborhood could choose from 45 alternatives to the Lay's homes.</TE>
<TE>   Full-time residents such as Carlson, an oral surgeon who began
buying property in Aspen in the early '70s and retired in his 40s,
aren't worried. "You don't get disaster sales in Aspen," he said.
Joshua Saslove of Joshua &amp; Co., who represents all the Lay
properties, reduced the prices of the pair of larger homes last week
from $6.5 and $6.8 million, "to reflect current market conditions."
Until those homes sell, the Lays will be on the hook for monthly
mortgage payments of $36,429 and $28,217. The annual property taxes
on the two homes are $9,967 and $7,672.</TE>
<TE>   Saslove received inquiries about all the Lay properties even
before three of them were listed on Nov. 12, about three weeks before
Enron filed for bankruptcy on Dec. 2. He was understandably pleased
that the cottage, appraised at $4.13 million and never officially on
the market, sold for more than twice that. "The true value of any
property is what a ready, willing and able purchaser will pay," he
said. "The sale price reflects the desirability of the lot, which is
large, close to town, right on the river, yet secluded." On a wooded
private lane, the single-story home, built in 1959, features sweeping
views of the mountains and is surrounded by towering spruce trees.</TE>
<TE>   "Aspen is a safe haven for money," Carlson said. "To me, if
someone has three houses and a lot here, they're parking cash. That's
what you would do if you didn't care if you were going to make money,
but you didn't want to lose it."</TE>
<TE>   A number of corporations--including Warner Bros.--keep homes in
Aspen for business entertaining. Yet Kenneth and Linda Lay's names,
not Enron, are on the deeds of all their Aspen properties.</TE>
<TE>   The two 4,500-square-foot houses on the market sit on a pretty
cul-de-sac with views of Aspen Mountain, in a neighborhood called
Oklahoma Flats. Once it was home to a mine dump and miners' shacks;
now, mega-chalets and grand cabins are gradually replacing more
modest, older houses. An 8,000-square-foot house is under
construction next to the Lays' riverfront place. The man who sold
them that house built himself an imposing stone starter castle down
the street that's just been completed.</TE>
<TE>   According to neighbors, the Lays, who have five adult children and
six grandchildren, preferred to stay in the cottage while their
family members would vacation in the Oklahoma Flats homes. Linda Lay,
56, decorated the cottage herself and designed some of the
landscaping.</TE>
<TE>   In the living room of the larger Oklahoma Flats house, which has
river frontage, a red, yellow and blue plastic child's table and
bench is the only element that clashes with the earth tones of the
formal country decor. All the conventions of the Aspen look are
included: high, vaulted ceilings, exposed lodgepole beams, a
two-story rock fireplace in the living room, windows generous enough
to do justice to the dramatic environment and a natural stone wall
surrounding the property.</TE>
<TE>   Across Spring Street, the other home isn't on as plum a lot, but
it reeks of all the good taste money can buy. By liberally appointing
every room with exquisite materials, local developer-designer
Kristeen Church created the feeling of a medieval manor in the
English countryside. A wood-salvage company in Pennsylvania provided
old barn siding that's used inside and out, as well as weathered,
mitered beams that could have graced an Amish farmhouse. For the
floors, Church had random widths of antique wooden planks sanded and
glazed with a natural finish that lets the warm brown, orange and
golden tones of the wood shine through. The marble in the master
suite has been crushed and tumbled to give it a more primitive
finish, then molded. In the house's 51/2 bathrooms, cabinets of
distressed alder wood are stained a deep chestnut. The kitchen
cabinets are of whitewashed bead board.</TE>
<TE>   No element is ordinary: Stairway railings attached to the wall are
carved branches, hand-hewn and waxed; reproductions of old, rustic
hinges are dark metal; local farmer's stone in the living room
fireplace has been aged; burnished copper exterior pipes glimmer in
the afternoon sun.</TE>
<TE>   It was Church's idea to sink wide logs into the plaster of one
wall in a guest bedroom. But Courtney Herrold, the wife of Linda
Lay's son David, chose all the furnishings and fabrics. Like many
Aspen locals who got to know members of the Lay family, Church speaks
well of them. "Courtney is very talented and did a beautiful job with
the house, which was not quite finished and unfurnished when the Lays
bought it," she says. "Linda does interior design as well, and is
very artistic. They were kind and thoughtful, wonderful to be around,
different from a lot of the Texas people who come here. If you saw
them walking around town, they wouldn't look fancy."</TE>
<TE>   Church honed her skills in the Aspen spec house market, which
boomed throughout the '90s, in more ways than one. The bigger the
houses got and the more luxurious their appointments (heated marble
bathroom floors, gyms and massage rooms), the higher the prices
climbed. Aspen had an airport where private jets could land and
zoning that favored single-family homes, not high-rise condo
buildings.</TE>
<TE>   The supply of lots was limited, so speculators found they could
make the greatest profit building homes for people who could afford
to pay millions for a second, third or fourth residence. Saslove has
been in Aspen real estate for 30 years. "I'm almost embarrassed to
tell you that I've never sold a house to someone who needed a primary
residence," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Aspen buyers aren't known for their patience. Once they acquire a
dream house in the mountains, they want to use it. Developers began
providing instant gratification in the form of homes that were
"toothbrush ready," a term that gave new meaning to "fully
furnished." Wine was in the cave, silverware in the drawers, towels
in the linen closets. Stories were told of deals signed in the
afternoon and housewarming parties given that night. "Some people
want to say, 'I'm here. Where do I put my toothbrush, and I'm going
skiing,'" Saslove said. The downside of the fully stocked vacation
houses is many of them feel generic and impersonal, like very nice,
expensively done suites at a Four Seasons Hotel. And the patina a
little real living would give them never forms, because they're empty
from six to 11 months a year.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of people come here for six weeks in the summer and six
weeks in the winter," Carlson says. "It makes the neighborhoods of
big houses less desirable because if you live in them you can feel
like you're in a ghost town. Your house will be the only one with
lights on."</TE>
<TE>   The electricity might be in use if caretakers are in for the
evening. Some absentee owners hire managers, others install workers
in staff quarters. Employee housing is a problem that Aspen
government has made an effort to address by requiring developers and
homeowners to provide affordable space to workers. "The city has
tried," Carlson said, "but employee housing is kind of a joke. You'll
find a lot of Ivy League graduates from upper middle-class families
spending a year in Aspen who find a way to qualify for it. The
chambermaids and busboys have to live in Paonia, Basalt and Silt. On
a winter day, that's a two-hour drive."  During the Christmas
holidays, the Lays sometimes took half a dozen rooms at a
$300-per-night motel for their staff.</TE>
<TE>   When they were in town, the couple made an effort to get involved
with a number of local organizations. All but $4 million of the $52.5
million in the Lay Family Foundation in 2000 was in Enron stock,
according to the Wall Street Journal, so it isn't clear whether a
$300,000 pledge they made to the Aspen Music Festival and School and
a $110,000 payment, the second of a pledged $550,000 to the Aspen
Center for Environmental Studies, will be made.</TE>
<TE>   Even part-time residents can climb Aspen's social ladder by
supporting the right community groups. If the Lays can't afford to
continue being charitable, will their social standing suffer? If a
man has been touched by scandal, does he find himself alone on a
chairlift designed for four? Convicted insider traders and trophy
wives with questionable histories have settled happily in Aspen.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a very forgiving town," said Saslove. Bill White, whose
family owned the Bank of Aspen from the '60s to the '80s, agreed. "In
Aspen," he said, "the only sin is not having enough money to come to
the party."</TE>

<LD>ELECTROBOY</LD>
<LD>   A Memoir of Mania</LD>
<LD>   By Andy Behrman</LD>
<TE>   Random House</TE>
<TE>   288 pages; $24.95</TE>
<TE>   Reading "Electroboy," Andy Behrman's in-your-face memoir of his
experience with manic-depression, is like trying to cuddle up to a
porcupine. No matter how you open your arms to embrace the story,
it's hard to walk away unscathed.</TE>
<TE>   Behrman chronicles years of high living, fast spending and
thrill-inducing episodes between his college days and his mid-30s,
during which he lives a bigger-than-life existence exacerbated by the
effects of manic-depression.</TE>
<TE>   Later, he is convicted of a felony for art forgery, sentenced to
prison and finally comes face to face with the reality of his
disorder.</TE>
<TE>   In the book's preface, Behrman skillfully describes the illness:
"Manic depression for me is like having the most perfect prescription
eyeglasses with which to see the world. Everything is precisely
outlined. Colors are cartoonlike.... [L]ife appears in front of you
on an oversized movie screen .... When I'm manic, my senses are so
heightened, I'm so awake and alert, that my eyelashes fluttering on
the pillow sound like thunder."</TE>
<TE>   Led by a narrator who is both self-aware and wonderfully intense,
one waits for Behrman to give a deeper understanding of what it means
to be mentally ill, to provide a glimpse of how newfound progress in
psychotropic drugs has impacted treatment and prognosis, and to offer
some insight into the experience of controversial electroconvulsive
therapy--the shock treatments hinted at in the book's title--which
Behrman undergoes 19 times.</TE>
<TE>   Lamentably, this wait is in vain. The cognizant stance with which
Behrman begins the memoir is abandoned immediately after the preface,
revisited only for a scant few pages at the end. The rest of the book
is devoted to the re-creation of look-at-me scenes.</TE>
<TE>   We're given Behrman getting money hand over fist by cheating
family, friends and business associates; Behrman making outrageous
business deals; Behrman participating in raunchy scenes of sexual
excess that are recounted in minute detail as if to demonstrate just
how downright fun life can be when you're manic. As his life gets
more and more out of control, an uninviting smugness taints the
account; it seems he's trying to prove that his reckless life is one
to be envied.</TE>
<TE>   Much of the memoir, in fact, may leave readers wondering what,
exactly, the scenes have to do with the subject at hand. True: Drug
use, alcohol abuse, shopping sprees and sexual excess are known
ingredients of manic-depression. The narrative is intent, though, on
celebrating these excesses without discussing their origin and
effects on his life.</TE>
<TE>   Many of the details--such as Behrman's role in arranging boy toys
for visiting executives when he worked for Armani--tell us nothing
about his struggle. Unfortunately, this exhibitionist pose does
little to earn credibility on the author's part, much less
understanding from the reader. The result is frustrating because he's
obviously more aware than he lets on; the preface and ending alone do
a wonderful job of telling the gut-level story.</TE>
<TE>   Instead of cleaving to that degree of honesty, though, Behrman
fills the work with a litany of hip restaurants and clubs, the
last-minute plane tickets he buys with the stash of cash he keeps in
his freezer, the designer clothes he wears and the many women and men
with whom he has tawdry sex.</TE>
<TE>   When he is sentenced to incarceration, his parents pay for him to
serve his time in a halfway house in lieu of prison. There, he is
given vast freedoms--allowed out daily to go to work, even to attend
Thanksgiving dinner at a family member's house. When his newly
purchased designer wardrobe--"The Calvin Klein Prison Collection," he
jokes--is stolen, his roommate confronts him with his obliviousness:
"[W]e're living among criminals. What do you expect?" Readers can't
help wondering the same thing.</TE>
<TE>   All of which creates a problem when the tone of the book shifts,
in the final pages, to a genuine understanding of what mental illness
has done to him. After being exasperated by his lack of
self-awareness, it's hard to scrounge up empathy for his
electroconvulsive therapy and ever-changing mix of prescription
drugs. And really, he doesn't want our empathy. Writing of his slow
recovery, of learning to take medication as indicated instead of on
whim, of keeping regular hours for sleeping and eating--of avoiding
the behaviors he knows will set off the disease--Behrman clearly
resents his own restoration: " ... I don't like any of it. I miss the
planes, the trips, the money, the dinners, the alcohol, the drugs and
the sex. My recovery," he tells us, "represents a tremendous loss."</TE>
<TE>   Manic-depression, Behrman writes, afflicts 2 million Americans,
and millions more go undiagnosed. There is an enormous amount of
suffering represented by those figures. "Electroboy," in its
narcissistic world, scarcely hints at the larger tragedy.</TE>

<LD>Tide Pools</LD>
<LD>   Located between the land and the sea, tide pools are a diverse
marine habitat stretching along our rocky coast. When the tide is
low, people may be fortunate enough to get a glimpse into a world
that is home to many animal and plant species.</LD>
<LD>   Animals that live in tide pools have developed special ways to
live in a changing environment. They have to survive the rise and
fall of the tides, the force of crashing waves, and the constant
change of temperature and salinity (salt levels). To keep from being
swept away into the ocean, animals such as anemones, urchins,
chitons, sea stars, snails and barnacles anchor or bury themselves in
rocks. When the tide is low, they cover themselves with seashells,
plant debris or granules of sand to create shade from the intense
heat of the sun.</LD>
<TE>   Tide pools provide excellent nurseries for young fish. Shallow
pools of water within the tide pools are ideal areas to avoid large
predators. Small fish, crabs and even octopuses hide within rocky
crevices. Various species of algae and sea grass also thrive in tide
pools because lots of sunlight gets through the shallow water.</TE>
<TE>   Searching through tide pools can be fun as long as people remember
that they are guests in the animals' home.</TE>
<TE>   Even though these animals can withstand harsh elements, it is
important to treat them with the utmost care. You can show respect
for the animals and help preserve this fascinating world by walking
carefully in their habitat, not taking home any souvenirs such as
shells and not leaving any trash behind. Thus, people can return time
and again to enjoy the intricate detail and unique beauty of tide
pools and all they have to offer.</TE>
<TE>   If you would like to learn more about tide pools, visit the
Southern California/Baja Gallery at the Aquarium of the Pacific. For
tickets and information, call (562) 590-3100 or visit www.a
quariumofpacific.org.</TE>

<KH>Fall 2002 NEW YORK COLLECTIONS</KH>
<HD>A Grand Finale</HD>
<DH>Jeremy Scott adds frivolity and fantasy, and veterans Donna
Karan and Calvin Klein present refined collections to close fall
shows.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MICHAEL QUINTANILLA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Darn those temperamental bustiers; they're enough to drive a designer
to tears. Just ask Los Angeles transplant Jeremy Scott, who brought
the fall collections to a rousing end with a spectacular salute to
Manhattan. But he couldn't savor the moment.</LD>
<LD>   "I'm so upset. Caroline's bustier wouldn't stay up," said the
perfectionist backstage. Get over it, Jeremy. No one in the audience
noticed. They were too busy having fun, which was the designer's
intention, with an over-the-top fantasy-filled collection that
brought the tents down at Bryant Park.</LD>
<LD>   As in his past shows in Paris, Scott staged a wildly entertaining
presentation. But unlike the work of two other newcomers to Fashion
Week, Zac Posen and Balenciaga's Nicolas Ghesquiere, Scott's
creations were more about showing off than putting on wearable
clothes.</LD>
<TE>   Still, he added a frivolity absent from a slate of shows dominated
with mostly dull collections with familiar Americana-themed clothes.
Even Helmut Lang, normally an innovator, knocked himself off with a
redux of layers and aprons.</TE>
<TE>   Fashion Week debutantes grabbed headlines early in the week, but
by Friday veteran designers Donna Karan and Calvin Klein had
presented gorgeous collections that brought an appropriate balance of
tradition and comfort as well as refinement and simple beauty.
Imagine that: beautiful, must-have clothes.</TE>
<TE>   Fashion's mood since Sept. 11 has been conservative. That was
reflected in the way that many designers staged their collections in
small venues, with guest lists trimmed drastically and parties scaled
back.</TE>
<TE>   But other things didn't change. Photographers prowled for famous
faces, often finding themselves flashing cameras at lesser-known rap
singers, models, fashion editors wearing sunglasses at night or the
omnipresent Kim Cattrall of "Sex and the City." Every show still was
at least 40 minutes late, several were tardy by at least an hour, and
at many, guests were rudely told they had to wait outside in the
bitter cold until the designers' handlers were ready to begin.</TE>
<TE>   And, despite a kinder, gentler atmosphere predicted at the start
of the week, at least 30 fashion editors and buyers had the doors at
Kenneth Cole's Friday morning show slammed in their faces when they
arrived by bus a couple of minutes before the presentation began. But
by Friday night, Scott, 28, a fun-loving and gentle man, lifted
security--the burly men even helped people onto the runway so they
could get backstage where everyone was welcomed.</TE>
<TE>   During the show a soundtrack blared, "Fashion is for fashion
people; get out there now and break the rules." Scott did exactly
that, sending ponytailed models with severe Cruella De Vil makeup
onto the catwalk in clothes that could best be described as Judy
Jetson on steroids. In a world of Xtreme everything, why not on the
runway?</TE>
<TE>   With one of the most colorful collections seen all week--Ralph
Lauren and Klein showed all black--Scott put his models in
super-sized dress silhouettes with exaggerated pointy shoulders,
collars that looked like man-eating Venus flytraps and deep V-shaped
hip pockets.</TE>
<TE>   Amid the mix of odd shapes in sherbet colors of pink, aqua,
orange, purple, peach and blue were only a few wearable looks,
including a blue and orange kimono-sleeved mini, an orange dress with
an attached shawl and other dresses and coats with cleverly attached
capes, some with two.</TE>
<TE>   The closing act introduced his first evening-wear collection,
which was bold and jubilant with sculptural gowns that were adorned
to look like skyscrapers. The gowns were accessorized with more than
$3 million in diamond jewelry. A security guard was posted at the end
of the runway and three more were backstage keeping watchful eyes on
the rocks.</TE>
<TE>   One gown with dozens of mirrored square insets looked like windows
on a high rise building; some in the audience whispered that the
image eerily reminded them of the World Trade Center towers. A
cocktail dress in camel leather had black leather windowpane insets.
Guests gave this Fashion Week maverick a standing ovation.</TE>
<TE>   Scott's tribute to New York marked the return of the Kansas City
native to the United States from Paris, where he has made a name for
himself with his shows if not with his clothes. Now he plans to
"become Los Angeles' designer," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "My message is for people to experiment with fashion, to move
forward into the future and most of all to have fun."</TE>
<TE>   That was a sentiment shared by Donna Karan after her presentation
in her 7th Avenue showroom. "The only thing I can give New York is
clothes you can feel and touch and hopefully have fun in," she said.
Now, more than ever, she said clothing "should fulfill one's fantasy
if just for a night out. We need that escape."</TE>
<TE>   Her "Manhattan Blues" collection evoked fantasy with sensible
style. Her collage and Art Deco-inspired tank and bias-cut T-shirt
dresses mixed cashmere, velvet, jersey and gauze, the last with which
she created sexy effects. Trousers, too, were bias cut and low-rise.
Ensembles, mostly in black and blue, were often paired with a man's
fedora. Sweater jackets, trench coats and padded kimono coats--all
collaged--rounded out a collection that reminds us of the design
brilliance that made Karan a household name.</TE>
<TE>   Calvin Klein also presented simple, lovely evening gowns that were
slim-fitting on top and billowed out into full bias-cut skirts. Other
looks included black sheer wool turtlenecks teamed with circle
skirts, tunics over pajama-styled pants, and double-breasted military
officer's coats with slouchy masculine trousers in a show where you
could see the clothes--in contrast to Lang's show.</TE>
<TE>   There, models walked in threes and fours during a five-minute show
at a Chelsea warehouse. In the blur, it was barely possible to see
the clothes. But maybe that was the designer's intention, because
there was very little new. What caught the eye as being fresh were
chunky sweaters, collage tops with lame insets and coats with satin
bands at the hem.</TE>
<TE>   Among other collections shown during the last days of Fashion
Week, Behnaz Sarafpour, another who showed for the first time, sent
out a noteworthy tailored collection of 14 pieces. Her romantic
looks, which included a top with a long skirt adorned with a vertical
row of small pockets that resembled finely handcrafted purses, were
inspired by classical poetry. The words of Emily Dickinson were
printed on a silk band belt, while Lord Byron's were on the hem of a
dress and Herman Melville's adorned the straps of a cocktail number.</TE>
<TE>   David Rodriguez, who hails from Indio, sent out a well-cut
collection of olive floral print chiffon wrap blouses, skirts and
dresses, and pinstriped trousers and coats with pretty floral
embroidery around the shoulders. Tapestry cocoon coats with mink
collars and wool knit tops with fox fringe sleeves were runway
standouts.</TE>
<TE>   Ralph Rucci, known for his attention to detail, presented a
collection with couture-styled embroideries and beading from Paris'
Francois Lesage and hand-embroidered lace. He devoted his line almost
exclusively to cashmere--sweaters, jackets, shirts and pants, nearly
every garment pintucked and pieced together--and kimono shapes.</TE>
<TE>   He sent out many a "red carpet" gown in taffeta, black
velvet--strapless and with stoles, fluted and tubed--including one
creation that featured an ostrich-leather corset with a matching
jacket over a ball gown.</TE>
<TE>   American fashion may be in a bit of a pause, as too many designers
revisit past looks. It was largely those who showed here for the
first time who rescued the week.</TE>

<LD>When my fiance, Johnny, was young he modeled himself after his hero,
H. Rap Brown. He pierced his ear, donned a black beret and bought a
denim jacket adorned with a clenched fist, in the black nationalists'
colors of red, black and green. His mother was worried, of course:
all this talk of revolution. But when her son stopped ditching school
and opted for college--in part, because his hero had--she decided
"Power to the People" wasn't so bad.</LD>
<LD>   Thirty years later, Johnny is the father of two teenage boys. Like
him, they emulate their heroes--rappers like Jay-Z and Ja
Rule--sporting baggy pants and gold chains and faux diamond studs in
both ears. Now he understands his mother's concerns, and has more of
his own.</LD>
<LD>   Because the message his sons get from their role models is not
about pride, self-reliance and preparation, but about a "thug life"
that glorifies drugs and guns and degrades women--one that measures a
man's success by how much jewelry he wears, the kind of liquor he
drinks and how many women he controls.</LD>
<TE>   So it was a relief this weekend to hear a new message emerge in a
room full of hip-hop artists, even though it came from a man so
controversial that his name probably sparks as much fear in parents
as the revolutionaries of an earlier generation did.</TE>
<TE>   The occasion was a conference on rap music, part of a three-day
convention sponsored by the Nation of Islam. There, its fiery leader,
Minister Louis Farrakhan, pulled no punches in urging young musicians
to use their talents to build up their community, rather than promote
values that lead to destruction. "You cannot contend in this world
ignorant. You cannot contend in this world full of bitterness and
hate," he told them. "You're young, you're fearless, you're strong.
But the power of your strength is being used against you."</TE>
<TE>   It is not just the statistics that suggest disaster, though the
numbers are scary enough themselves: More than 30% of young black men
are either in prison, on probation or on parole. Black teenage boys
are twice as likely as whites to be the victims of violent crime, and
they are murdered at 10 times the rate of white youths their age.</TE>
<TE>   Then there are the anecdotes, as well, like this story sent to me
by a young, black male teacher, troubled by the behavior of his Los
Angeles middle-schoolers: "This year, 95% of the black boys I educate
are failing my eighth-grade algebra class, despite all of them being
at least as capable as those [who are passing]," he said. "These 95%
waste most of their class time, do little or no homework, are
preoccupied with sports and girls, deride the 5% passing my class as
'soft' or 'weak,' are consumed with wearing the latest 'gear,' only
read when the teacher pleads, and laugh when they get Fs. While I
love them as intensely as I love my own son, I loathe their academic
skills, attitude and [lack of] commitment."</TE>
<TE>   Depending on whom you ask, there is no shortage of explanations:
not enough jobs, inadequate schools, unprepared families. A welfare
system that has made fathers irrelevant, a prison system that has
made them unavailable. Anger, hopelessness. A spiritual void, a
cultural malaise.... It's no wonder we get tangled up when we try to
navigate among them.</TE>
<TE>   But the message I kept hearing last week, at the Nation of Islam's
annual convention, was not about causes but solutions. And it
embodied what we might call radical thinking--the same kind of
thinking that encouraged dispirited young men growing up a generation
ago: Use your talent to lift yourselves. Give something back to your
community. Respect the wisdom of your elders. Create the kind of
world you'd want your children to inherit.</TE>
<TE>   At its accompanying Hip-Hop Summit in Beverly Hills, young rappers
rose to applaud as Farrakhan lauded them for their creativity, their
brilliance, their financial success. Then gently, sternly--as a
father would a child--Farrakhan took them to task for the path their
art has taken: The coarse language, the debasement of women, the
glorification of flash and dazzle over knowledge and self-respect.</TE>
<TE>   There are more important things than riches and popularity, he
told them. "Don't sell your soul for some alligator shoes and some
diamonds you can put around your neck, and somebody with a gun can
take from you.... Remember, there are children who can't read 'Dick
and Jane,' but can recite the words to your raps. They're not
listening to the teacher in school, but they are listening to you.
You are the teacher. You have to accept the responsibility now."</TE>
<TE>   The cheering died down, as the young rappers cast sidelong looks
at one another. But, lining the walls in their suits and ties, the
young brothers from the Nation of Islam kept on clapping. And I stood
and joined them in their applause.</TE>
<TE>   There's an image that goes with the Nation of Islam and its fiery
leader: race-baiters, separatists, hate-mongers. That's not what I
saw and heard when I watched and listened, and I realized that
sometimes what you see is really what you choose to focus on.</TE>
<TE>   What I noticed at the convention center were hundreds of young men
treating each other--and the women and children around them--with
respect. No loud voices or curses, no insults or cross words. There
were men pushing baby strollers, carrying toddlers, holding hands
with their wives, opening doors. They were neatly dressed in suits
and ties, or jackets bearing slogans like "Keep the Peace" and
"Self-Improvement Is the Basis for Community Development."</TE>
<TE>   As I prepared to leave, I stood outside an elevator in a crowd too
large to board. The doors slid open and no one moved. Then the young
men at the front of the group stepped back and extended their arms.
"After you, sisters," they said, holding open the doors.</TE>
<TE>   And I felt not fear, but pride, as I stepped inside. You might not
like the slogans or the packaging, but there was nothing here to make
a mother afraid.</TE>

<HD>The Otherwhere Ice Show</HD>
<DH>Part 2 The story so far: Molly is alone on the frozen pond

Skate Club Ice Show.</DH>

<LD>Molly warmed up with figure eights, then sped across the ice to go
into her jump. It was too weak. She stumbled halfway through it and
made a clumsy recovery. She circled the pond to try again.</LD>
<LD>   A voice broke the silence. Someone was calling to her. "You're
late, Molly! The show will be starting soon."</LD>
<LD>   Startled, Molly stared at the tall man who appeared between the
trees across the pond. Who was he? What was he doing here?</LD>
<TE>   He wore a black uniform with sparkling buttons and high, shiny
boots, and he carried a short whip, like a circus ringmaster. Three
tiny women wearing spangled pink gowns appeared beside him and skated
toward her. They were shorter than Molly although they looked like
adults. Suddenly there was music coming from nowhere and the stars on
the tree branches had become spotlights that sent rays to the center
of the pond.</TE>
<TE>   The man strode across the ice and stood before her. "You need a
costume," he said. "You can't perform in those grubby sweats."</TE>
<TE>   "What are you talking about?" she asked, bewildered. "Who are
you?"</TE>
<TE>   The young man gave her a dazzling smile. He had black curly hair
and shining green eyes. He was very tall. Molly only came up to the
second button on his waist-length jacket.</TE>
<TE>   "He's Magnus, of course," one of the little women told her.</TE>
<TE>   "Everybody in Otherwhere knows Magnus," said another.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm Magnus the magician," he told Molly, "and you're Molly
Watson."</TE>
<TE>   "How did you know?"</TE>
<TE>   "We know what goes on in your world, and I know you need my help
or I wouldn't be here." He lifted his whip and a jewel flashed at the
end of it.</TE>
<TE>   "You're Cinderella in the ice show, aren't you?" He waved the whip
and Molly saw her clothes had changed to a ragged dress smeared with
soot.</TE>
<TE>   Wednesday: Will Magnus help Molly land a double axel?</TE>
<TE>   Gail Kimberly lived in Ottawa, Canada, where she learned to skate.
But she never could do the double axel. This story will be on The

<HD>Tinker Bell's Fairy Godmother</HD>
<DH>Model Margaret Kerry helped breathe life into the cartoon
pixie.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>AL RIDENOUR</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Margaret Kerry is quite earnest in describing herself as Tinker
Bell's alter ego. She is hardly the type to astrally regress to Never
Land, or to fannishly emulate a character from a cartoon. If
anything, it would be closer to the truth to say that Tinker Bell,
instead, was the one to imitate Kerry.</LD>
<LD>   Before Peter Pan's glittering sidekick ever fluttered to screen,
Kerry had already gone through all her pixie paces. On a bare
soundstage, wearing her own bathing suit as a costume, and assisted
only by an occasional oversized prop or mattresses to pad a fall, the
then-22-year-old Kerry, along with other actors, enacted the
production's storyboards giving animators reference films for
gestures, key poses and timing.</LD>
<LD>   That old footage, used to help give life to the original animated
1953 "Peter Pan," is still preserved in the Disney archives and was
pulled out nearly 50 years later for animators creating Peter Pan's
newest adventure, "Return to Never Land."</LD>
<TE>   "Lots of people don't understand all this," says Kerry. "They
think the entire movie comes from the animator's head, but I say wait
a minute--Marc Davis [Tinker Bell's animator] is a man's man--how
does he know how a 31/2-inch sprite is going to move, get angry, or
stamp her foot? And how does he know what kind of emotion would go
behind that? How does he know how Wendy's skirt will wrap when she
walks? Or flies for that matter? What Marc did was take something and
then exaggerate it so it was more truly delightful."</TE>
<TE>   This use of live action was by no means unique to "Peter Pan." In
Disney's "Snow White" and "Sleeping Beauty," actual footage was not
merely referenced but often painstakingly traced or "rotoscoped."
Live action continues to be used in animation today.</TE>
<TE>   Kerry easily recognizes her own body language in the 1953 film. So
did her second husband, Jack Willcox, whom she once took to a "Peter
Pan" screening. "I was so excited and nudging him," she recalls.
"'There I am!' I said. 'Jack! Jack! Jack, that's me!' He just leaned
over and said, 'Margaret, I'd recognize those thighs anywhere.'"</TE>
<TE>   Kerry's legs had in fact been christened the "Most Beautiful Legs
in Hollywood" shortly before "Peter Pan" went into production, a fact
she now begrudgingly acknowledges. "Terrible thing! It was a real
throwback from the early '30s. But my girlfriend wanted to do it if
I'd go, so I did, and I won. She never spoke to me again."</TE>
<TE>   During her audition, Kerry says, it was her pantomime of Tinker
Bell standing on a hand mirror sizing up her hips that got her the
part. Other scenes such as that of the pixie stuck in a keyhole, hips
gratuitously wriggling in a rear-angle shot lent an
uncharacteristically saucy element to this Disney classic based on
the James M. Barrie story.</TE>
<TE>   "You just didn't get shot like that in a family movie," Kerry
admits. "There were a lot of people who thought Tink was just a
little too sexy. But what Marc [Davis] told me--how he got away with
it--was keeping the bottom half womanly but drawing the top half as a
little girl." Perhaps owing something to this combination of mature
allure and girlish innocence, an urban legend arose during the 1980s
that Marilyn Monroe had been the model upon which Tinker Bell was
based.</TE>
<TE>   Kerry's fairyland work history dates back to childhood  when, at
age 4, she played a nymph in Max Reinhardt's "A Midsummer Night's
Dream." "We ran around to a playback, holding twigs covered with
white paint and glitter," she laughs. "We had all kinds of cellophane
icicles dripping off of us. It seemed pretty silly." There followed
roles in the several "Our Gang" episodes, a part playing Eddie
Cantor's daughter in the 1948 musical "If You knew Susie," and
ongoing appearances in one of ABC's first sitcoms, "The Ruggles."</TE>
<TE>   After "Peter Pan," Kerry returned to animation, albeit a form of
animation far removed from Disney's graceful choreography. Working
with her first husband, Ritchard Brown, she provided voices for the
early syndicated cartoons "Clutch Cargo" (1959) and "Space Angel"
(1962). Produced on a shoestring, and nearly as static as a comic
book viewed through a movie camera, these productions featured
Synchro-Vox, a weirdly effective technique for achieving lip-synced
dialogue by employing live-action mouths projected onto animation
artwork.</TE>
<TE>   "They had us in white makeup with lipstick," Kerry recalls. "The
white makeup would blur out, and all you had was the lips. But you
could never do anything about that pink tongue. It was always this
weird pink thing wiggling in the background."</TE>
<TE>   Kerry went on to do other voice-over work, employing a repertoire
of 21 dialects and 48 voices, but closest to her heart is the little
fairy who speaks only through a tinkling bell. That character, she
feels, is unique in children's literature and film. "She was curvy;
she was jealous; she wouldn't stand for anything; she was courageous.
People forget how courageous she was to drink the poison [in James M.
Barrie's original stage version]. And she was probably the first
character young boys had pitter-patter hearts for! At the same time,"
Kerry notes, "she showed a lot of little girls that it was OK to be a
little girl."</TE>
<TE>   Now, at age 72, an energetic Kerry is still working, using her
voice. Her radio show, "What's Up Weekly" uses a variety/magazine
format on Glendale's KKLA-FM (99.5) Christian radio.</TE>
<TE>   And, she makes occasional public appearances in connection with
her role in helping give human dimension to Tinker Bell. Over and
over, she has encountered adulation for this diminutive creature.</TE>
<TE>   "About a year and a half ago, a lady came up to me, and she was
just absolutely trembling. She said, 'I never thought that I would
ever meet the real Tinker Bell! You saved my life!'"</TE>
<TE>   Kerry listened to the woman's story of a struggle with morbid
obesity that confined her to a wheelchair and necessitated
knee-replacement surgery.</TE>
<TE>   Explaining her loss of more than 150 pounds, the now-healthy woman
told Kerry, "I knew I had to pull myself out of this, and needed
something with me every time dark thoughts would come."</TE>
<TE>   Lifting her pant leg, she revealed an ankle tattoo of Kerry's
alter ego. "Tinker Bell is just the happiest character that I know,"
she told Kerry.</TE>

<HD>Hall of Fame Induction Brings Talking Heads Together Again</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROGER CATLIN</AU>
<BD>HARTFORD COURANT</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Talking Heads will perform together for the first time in 14
years when the band is inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame
next month.</LD>
<LD>   "I'm sure a lot of fans are thinking, 'Oh, gosh, this is going to
be a reunion,'" bassist Tina Weymouth says from her home in Westport,
Conn.</LD>
<LD>   Rather, she says, "this is the moment we thank people behind the
scenes to tell them how great they are."</LD>
<TE>   The Heads haven't played together since a 1988 gig of the Tom Tom
Club, the side project that Weymouth and her husband, drummer Chris
Frantz, started when they were still Talking Heads.  Weymouth says
the four--she and Frantz and lead singer David Byrne and keyboardist
Jerry Harrison--have discussed which songs they might play at the
induction ceremonies March 18, which will be broadcast on VH1 two
days later.</TE>
<TE>   "We haven't come to a decision yet," she says. "David's in Osaka
[Japan], and mail is slow, even though it's e-mail."</TE>
<TE>   The band has been afforded a couple of days to rehearse at New
York's S.I.R. studios before the event, but they probably won't need
it. "Jerry's a good player, and the rest of us have kept our chops up
with other bands."</TE>
<TE>   She says she doesn't know the level of participation expected for
the jams that follow the inductions, whose honorees this year also
include the Ramones, Tom Petty, Isaac Hayes, Gene Pitney and Brenda
Lee.</TE>
<TE>   "First of all, the Ramones don't jam," she says. "And the Paul
Shaffer band, who organize it, are great, but they're a little loud
for us. I find it terrifically difficult to jam with people when
you're getting your head knocked off."</TE>
<TE>   "We'll figure things out as we go," Weymouth says. "This is one of
those things where you have to go with the flow."</TE>
<TE>   Two  weeks ago, Frantz and Weymouth were on hand for the B-52s'
25th-anniversary gig at New York's Irving Plaza. The Talking Heads
met that band while touring in Atlanta in 1977 and encouraged them to
play for some record executives they knew in New York.</TE>
<TE>   The husband-and-wife rhythm section accompanied the B-52s on a
1984 tour of New England that preceded a Rock in Rio showcase.</TE>
<TE>   The New York show "was a blast," Weymouth says. "We got up there
and played 'Planet Claire' in the encore with them. It was like old
times."</TE>
<TE>   Anyone hoping that the old times of the Talking Heads will
continue with a reunion after next month's induction will be
disappointed, she says.</TE>
<TE>   "There's no way we would like to force something. Chris and I have
other things going, and we don't want to drop the ball like that."</TE>
<TE>   Roger Catlin is rock music critic for the Hartford Courant, a
Tribune company.</TE>

<DH>Strings and rural music resonate in 'Down from the
Mountain' concert.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD CROMELIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Every instrumental sound that came from the Universal Amphitheatre
stage for three hours Sunday night came from strings. Stretched taut
on mandolins, fiddles, guitars, basses and banjos, gut and steel were
plucked, picked and strummed, bowed, hammered, slapped and bent. Not
even such folk-permitted instruments as tambourines, pipes,
squeezeboxes and harmonicas intruded in this world. Nothing was
plugged into an amplifier. Drums? You've got to be kidding.</LD>
<LD>   Welcome to "Down From the Mountain," the concert extension of the
music from the Coen brothers' picaresque parable, "O Brother, Where
Art Thou?" That 2000 movie's soundtrack of rural music from the
Depression-era South has become one of the big success stories of the
last year, starting out with zero commercial expectations and going
on to sell more than 4 million albums. It has five Grammy
nominations, including one for album of the year.</LD>
<LD>   This could be considered the Appalachian branch of the Buena Vista
Social Club. There are obvious parallels between these two phenomena,
both of which revive a tradition under the supervision of an eclectic
producer (T Bone Burnett in this case) and serve it up to a broad
audience. "O Brother" allows casual listeners to participate in the
genre without rolling up their sleeves and thumbing through the
bluegrass bins or packing the family off to a folk festival.</LD>
<TE>   This tends to offend folk snobs, who feel like villagers overrun
by tourists, but it's hard to complain about wide exposure for a
cultural treasure such as Ralph Stanley. Still, it doesn't justify
the air of self-congratulation that crept into master of ceremonies
Bob Neuwirth's comments--at times it seemed like the political
convention of a third party that suddenly finds itself leading the
polls--especially when the music itself made its own case so
eloquently.</TE>
<TE>   The soundtrack album is just an hour long, and for this staging
(which is currently on its first extended tour, with a likely return
to Southern California in the summer) those songs served as a
framework for a sprawling survey of acoustic Americana, from mud-raw
(the a cappella elders the Fairfield Four) to city slick (the
Nashville Bluegrass Band).</TE>
<TE>   The movie itself exudes a male sensibility, but Sunday's concert
was, among other things, a showcase for female singers, with a regal
Emmylou Harris heading a cast that also featured Alison Krauss, Nancy
Blake (briefly), Patty Loveless (filling in for Gillian Welch), and
Sharon and Cheryl White (of the group the Whites). And waiting in the
wings, so to speak, are the Peasall sisters, three tots with twang
ages 8, 11 and 14, who closed the first half of the concert with
their two "O Brother" contributions.</TE>
<TE>   Dan Tyminski, from Krauss' band Union Station, did his version of
"I Am a Man of Constant Sorrow," the film's key song and the
recording that spurred the album's success. The Universal stop also
marked veteran blues-folk figure Taj Mahal's first night on the tour
and featured "O Brother" co-star Tim Blake Nelson--the only actor who
did his own singing--delivering "In the Jailhouse Now."</TE>
<TE>   It was all crowned by bluegrass patriarch Stanley, alone first for
his a cappella "O Death," then joined by Nashville Bluegrass Band and
Loveless and then all the participants.</TE>
<TE>   You might be able to see most of these acts during the course of a
year at such rooms as McCabe's or the Folk Music Center, but the
combinations and the sheer concentration of quality artists gave
Sunday's show the weight of a major event and the blissful spirit of
a community sing.</TE>

<HD>A Close Look at Herself</HD>
<DH>Theater* A return to the stage has reconnected Judith Light
to her origins. A turn in 'Wit' earned praise; now she's in 'Sorrows
and Rejoicings.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JUSTIN GLANVILLE</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>In the opening scene of Athol Fugard's new play, "Sorrows and
Rejoicings," Judith Light appears alone on a dark stage. A sob begins
to rise in her throat. But her character, who has just returned home
from her husband's funeral, quickly stifles the sob when her maid
enters.</LD>
<LD>   Light's face flattens into an opaque mask as she controls her
emotions. And she maintains that steely control until the play's
conclusion, when emotion finally takes over. It is a transformation
that Light has been trying to achieve in her own life.</LD>
<LD>   "I want to control everything, and it's silly," says the
self-described control freak. "I'm really working to let go of
control and to let myself be guided."</LD>
<TE>   So far, that strategy appears to be paying off. The former star of
the TV sitcom "Who's the Boss?" has returned to the stage. She won
raves two years ago for her performance in Margaret Edson's Pulitzer
Prize-winning play "Wit," and critics responded last year with equal
enthusiasm to her portrayal of the title character in Henrik Ibsen's
"Hedda Gabler" at the Shakespeare Theatre in Washington, D.C.</TE>
<TE>   Now comes "Sorrows and Rejoicings." The play, about two women
confronting each other following the death of the man they both
loved, is running at the off-Broadway theater Second Stage. Light
portrays the uptight widow, Allison; Charlayne Woodard co-stars as
Marta, the maid who was the lover of Allison's estranged husband.</TE>
<TE>   During a break in the production's harried schedule--rehearsal
during the day, preview performances at night--Light, 52, is relaxed
and confiding. She wears Allison's inky black suit and
corporate-style hairdo, layered and streaked with frosty blond
highlights.</TE>
<TE>   "I see Allison as a universal symbol for the way most of us go
through life until something stunning stops us in our tracks, and we
realize that we have lived and are living closed-down, frightened, in
regret, in sorrow," Light says.</TE>
<TE>   Light's career began smoothly enough. After graduating from the
theater program at Carnegie Mellon University in 1971, she spent five
years in repertory theater, then moved to New York. A steady stream
of roles followed, beginning with a Broadway production of Ibsen's "A
Doll's House" in 1975.</TE>
<TE>   But a few years later, the offers began to dry up, and Light found
herself out of work for about six months. "I started to get really
tight and really frightened," she says. "I didn't know when the
unemployment was going to run out." Despair began to paralyze her,
and she considered abandoning acting altogether.</TE>
<TE>   Although she had vowed never to do television, she was forced to
relax her standards, taking a job as an understudy on the soap opera
"One Life to Live." Soon she was a star of the show, winning daytime
Emmys in 1980 and 1981 for her portrayal of a prostitute. "Who's the
Boss?" followed in 1984.</TE>
<TE>   Working in television was a humbling experience, she says.</TE>
<TE>   "I was on my big high horse and I was only going to do theater or
feature films, but that's not the way it happened," she said. "I made
a conscious choice to be open to what was coming my way."</TE>
<TE>   After "Who's the Boss?" ended in 1992, Light appeared in a slew of
TV movies and starred in an ill-fated sitcom, "The Simple Life," in
1998. But the work began to feel stale, and critics and audiences
were becoming increasingly indifferent.</TE>
<TE>   It was one of Light's side projects--her work for charities
supporting AIDS victims and gay rights--that inspired her to make a
change. After doing the TV movie "The Ryan White Story," which
chronicled the struggles of the young hemophiliac who got the AIDS
virus from a blood transfusion and died when he was 18, Light became
a speaker on the fund-raising circuit.</TE>
<TE>   Eventually, the gulf between her public activism and private life
began to bother her. "I said, 'I'm not going to talk to everybody and
say how inspired I am by the gay community and live another way.'"</TE>
<TE>   She vowed to audition for the next play she was offered. As luck
would have it, the play was "Wit," in which she was required to shave
her head and appear nude on stage.</TE>
<TE>   Deciding to take the role wasn't easy, says Light, who was afraid
she would embarrass herself. However, her fears of humiliation proved
unfounded. Reviewing "Wit" in the New York Times in 1999, Peter Marks
wrote that Light's performance "cuts poignantly close to the bone."</TE>
<TE>   Fugard has only the highest praise for Light's performance in
"Sorrows and Rejoicings," which he is also directing. He chose her
for the play after what he calls a "very long and very wonderful"
lunch last year in Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   "A friend said of Judith's performance that she walks onto the
stage at the beginning of the show like a perfect ice cube and then
you watch her melt down into a glass of pure and very sweet water by
the end of the play," he says. "It's a glorious image, and exactly
what Judith achieves. When my friend said that, I thought, 'Well, at
least I got one thing right.'"</TE>
<TE>   After "Sorrows and Rejoicings" closes, Light will spend March and
April in South Africa, where she will participate in a seven-day trek
to raise money for AIDS research.</TE>
<TE>   As for her career, she plans to resume her dogged pursuit of no
control.</TE>
<TE>   "You know that thing I told you about asking the universe for
guidance?" she asks, laughing. "I'm going to do that."</TE>

<HD>Marketing Coup: Let a Fan Do the Work</HD>

<LD>Nick Des Barres is a 23-year-old aspiring actor and ex-video game
magazine designer who can normally be found at any hour--the later,
the better--playing Rez, Final Fantasy 10 and Metal Gear Solid 2.</LD>
<LD>   Now he has something to add to his resume: He's designed the movie
poster for "Resident Evil," an action horror film that's being
released by Screen Gems next month.</LD>
<LD>   Under normal circumstances, an untutored fan like Des Barres
wouldn't have a prayer of even getting in the door. Known in the
business as one-sheets, posters are the product of a sophisticated,
tightly controlled marketing process by which print advertising firms
submit dozens of poster concepts to studios, which decide on a final
image only after running contenders past a gantlet of market research
focus groups.</LD>
<TE>   But when Screen Gems marketing chief Valerie Van Galder saw
"Resident Evil," she thought it was the kind of movie that needed a
fan-friendly approach. Based on a popular video game of the same
name, "Resident Evil" was clearly a movie whose core audience would
be young video game fans and Internet geeks.</TE>
<TE>   Made by Paul W.S. Anderson, who directed the video game-derived
"Mortal Kombat," the film features Milla Jovovich and Michelle
Rodriguez as commandos who have three hours to neutralize a deadly
virus that has overwhelmed a genetic research facility and threatens
to overrun the entire planet. It's full of yucky creatures like the
Licker and the Zombie Dogs that are well known to fans of the "Evil"
video games.</TE>
<TE>   A Web devotee who still believes that the fabled "Blair Witch
Project" online blitzkrieg was a portent of things to come, Van
Galder had a brainstorm: If we really want a poster that appeals to
young, Internet-savvy video gamers, why not let one of them design
the poster?</TE>
<TE>   After plowing through studio legal obstacles, (Screen Gems is a
division of Sony Pictures Entertainment), Van Galder launched the
poster design contest on "Resident Evil's" Web site. Contestants were
given a studio-designed title treatment, roughly 100 stills from the
movie and links to graphic software. After that, they were on their
own. Publicizing the contest solely through Internet word-of-mouth,
Screen Gems got 3,000 submissions.</TE>
<TE>   Van Galder and three other staffers picked five finalists, put
them on the Web and received 10,000 votes on the winner. Des Barres'
poster--which features the film's heroines surrounded by ghost-like
hands clawing at them in a sea of blackness--won by a landslide. In
addition to having the studio use his artwork, Des Barres received
$2,500, a framed poster and a free screening for friends on the Sony
lot.</TE>
<TE>   What makes the "Evil" poster contest so unusual is that it defies
one of the original commandments of Hollywood: Never give up control
of any aspect of your publicity campaign. But times are changing in
movie marketing. One of the past year's biggest hits, New Line
Cinema's "The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring" owes at
least some of its success to a savvy Internet marketing campaign that
allowed fan-based Web sites unprecedented access to the filmmaking
process.</TE>
<TE>   Van Galder has a similar philosophy at Screen Gems, a veteran film
label that was reborn three years ago and that bears a close
resemblance to the brash mid-90s-era New Line; its mandate is to
release modest-budgeted genre films geared to young moviegoers. In
the last year, its films have included "Snatch," a Brad Pitt-starring
gangster comedy; "Two Can Play That Game," an African American
romantic comedy with Morris Chestnut and Vivica A. Fox; and a
low-budget Richard Gere thriller called "The Mothman Prophecies,"
which just passed the $30-million mark at the box office.</TE>
<TE>   Though it is housed on the button-down Sony lot, Screen Gems is an
oasis of informality. Van Galder's office door has a photo of Pitt
from the "Snatch" premiere which her staff has adorned with the
scrawled inscription: "Don't worry, Val, I'm a Money-Making Machine!"
The "Evil" poster contest was a good example of Screen Gems'
eagerness to use the Internet as a link between the studio and young
moviegoers.</TE>
<TE>   Poster Contest 'Was the Ultimate Focus Group'</TE>
<TE>   "If you do research to see what a movie's core audience likes,
then this was the ultimate focus group," says Van Galder. "The
Internet is the key market that wants to see this film, and they
overwhelmingly picked the poster they liked, so in a way it was
better than having a focus group do it. We let the real fans do it."</TE>
<TE>   Even though movie posters from Hollywood's golden age are valuable
collectibles, today's film posters are a neglected art. Since the
rise of TV advertising in the late 1970s, posters have been relegated
to a lesser role in movie marketing campaigns. It's no coincidence
that the last great era of poster design, which produced a string of
evocative images for films like "The Exorcist," "Rosemary's Baby" and
"A Clockwork Orange," came just before the ascendancy of TV ad
campaigns.</TE>
<TE>   Research has shown that the vast majority of moviegoers make their
film-going decisions based on TV ads and movie trailers. Poster
design has also been hamstrung by star contracts that give actors
control over the size and placement of their names and image.</TE>
<TE>   Nonetheless, posters remain a pivotal ingredient in movie
publicity campaigns, establishing a film's identity by providing fans
with the first images from an upcoming movie. For movie marketers,
it's a no-brainer: If you're paying a star $20 million, your poster
might as well display his or her head as if were a Thanksgiving Day's
parade balloon.</TE>
<TE>   That's what Sony did with Mel Gibson on the poster for "The
Patriot" and MGM did with Bruce Willis on the "Hart's War" poster,
even though he's not the Hart of the movie. The poster for "Vanilla
Sky" is virtually identical to the poster for "Jerry Maguire," except
in the "Vanilla Sky" version, the giant picture of Tom Cruise has sky
and clouds behind it.</TE>
<TE>   But many of the best modern-day posters have substituted movie
star bobble heads with more vivid imagery. "Ocean's Eleven" was
chockfull of big-name actors, but Warner Bros. simply showed the
outline of their legs, straddling an "11" painted in red at their
feet. "It's a great piece of graphic art, because it evoked the
coolness of the original movie with a modern sensibility," says
DreamWorks marketing chief Terry Press. "It essentially said, 'This
cast is so great we only need to show their feet!'"</TE>
<TE>   When DreamWorks released "What Lies Beneath" in 2000, it had two
stars--Harrison Ford and Michelle Pfeiffer--but chose a poster that
showed a woman's hand, a wedding ring visible on her finger,
clutching at the edge of a bathtub.</TE>
<TE>   The studio's poster for "American Beauty," its 1999 Oscar best
picture, was devoid of stars as well, instead displaying a woman's
hand pressing a single red rose next to her exposed belly button. The
studio has designed an equally striking poster for "The Road to
Perdition," a film starring Tom Hanks due out in July. Although Hanks
is pictured in the poster, leading a young boy with one hand, holding
a tommy gun in the other, his face is partially obscured by the
shadow of his fedora and a driving rain.</TE>
<TE>   Each Poster Conveys an Image or a Mood</TE>
<TE>   The common denominator? Each poster conveys an instantly
identifiable image or mood. As DreamWorks creative advertising chief
David Sameth puts it: "The image becomes an icon that the audience
will always associate with the movie."</TE>
<TE>   At one glance, you could tell that "What Lies Beneath" was a
Hitchcockian thriller, that "American Beauty" was tangled up with
ideas of temptation. The poster for "Road to Perdition" has a
bleakness that evokes the saga of a hit man on a journey of revenge
after much of his family is murdered.</TE>
<TE>   "It's all about will you cross the lobby of the theater to look at
our poster?" says Press. "Sometimes a movie star's face isn't the
most valuable piece of information for the consumer. I'll trade Tom
Hanks' face for someone thinking the poster has an arresting image,
because the longer you look at the poster, the more likely you are to
want to see the movie."</TE>
<TE>   Another current winner is the poster for Revolution Studios'
"Black Hawk Down," which shows Josh Hartnett, one of the soldiers in
the film, sitting on the edge of a helicopter, his gun cradled in one
hand, his helmet in the other, his face etched with grime and blood.
The image--taken from a still photo shot between takes--is pensive
and haunting, with none of Hollywood's usual war movie swagger.</TE>
<TE>   "[Director] Ridley Scott picked the shot himself and fought
vociferously to use it as the poster image," explains Revolution
chief Joe Roth. "For Ridley, this was what the movie was about. There
are no flags waving, no gung-ho soldiers, none of the war movie
cliches."</TE>
<TE>   The best movie posters are half art, half advertising and all
visual stimulation. They tickle our subconscious through the art of
suggestion. Des Barres' "Resident Evil" design isn't going to make a
movie poster hall of fame, but its image delivers a clear
message--this movie is going to give you a real scare.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm no poster expert," says Des Barres. "But I wanted to suggest
a lot of gore without hitting you over the head with it. You only
have five seconds to catch someone's eye, so I wanted to do something
that people might think was striking and new."</TE>

<HD>Emotion From the Front Lines in 'War Letters'</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DIANE HAITHMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Between "Saving Private Ryan," "Band of Brothers" and "Black Hawk
Down"--not to mention our current involvement in Afghanistan--war has
been in the forefront of American culture in recent times. And now
it's appearing on another front.</LD>
<LD>   "War Letters," which had its world premiere Sunday at the Canon
Theatre in Beverly Hills, is the stage version of the book
"Extraordinary Correspondence From American Wars." That impressive
volume, edited by Andrew Carroll and published last May, contains 200
wartime letters written by Americans from the Civil War through
Desert Storm. About 40 of those missives make it into the stage
version.</LD>
<LD>   When reading the book, you can choose your letters. You can choose
how much of each letter to read. You can even choose your war. As
emotional as some of the material is, Carroll's book is not a
narrative; it goes against the grain to read these letters like a
novel, cover to cover.</LD>
<TE>   You can't make those kinds of choices at "War Letters." With a few
notable exceptions, the attempt to force these letters to exist as a
chronological, staged piece, war by war, remains curiously
uninvolving--despite letters that contain such passionate
declarations as, "I would rather write to you than eat when hungry."
Despite admirable intentions, the adaptation to the stage is nothing
to write home about.</TE>
<TE>   The letters used in both book and staged version are the result of
a phenomenon called the Legacy Project. Carroll, now 32, wrote a 1998
letter to Dear Abby urging Americans to preserve their war
correspondence, and asked the column's readers to send him a copy of
each letter. Carroll's plea spawned an avalanche of 60,000 letters.
The book made the New York Times bestseller list and a PBS
documentary on the project aired last December.</TE>
<TE>   The stage version, produced by Robert Redford's Sundance Theatre
and Canon Theatre's Susan Dietz, is the latest incarnation of the
project. Though the book was published before the attacks on America,
the stage version not unexpectedly tags on a Sept. 11 e-mail from a
New Yorker to his family</TE>
<TE>   It's easy to be impressed by the Legacy Project--and with the
apparent extreme niceness of Carroll, who serves as executive
director of the American Poetry &amp; Literary Project in Washington,
D.C., and sees to it that all proceeds from the book are donated to
veterans' organizations. Sundance Theatre is a nonprofit organization
that supports developing artists and new work for the stage. You are
doing a good thing by coming to this play.</TE>
<TE>   Because of all this honorable baggage, it feels like treason to
observe that "War Letters" struggles to take flight. And, while one
might expect this play to seem more poignant to a nation at war, five
long months of our own hideous headlines have only weakened the punch
of these observations from years past. This is the not the first time
someone has observed that war is hell.</TE>
<TE>   The work is staged, but not dramatized, exactly. Photographs of
grisly war scenes, historic moments, even of the torn, stained
letters themselves, are projected across stretched fabric
constructions that hint of military tents. Sound and visuals
appropriate to the period--bright tie-dye patterns and student
protests for Vietnam, chilling rhetoric from the Third Reich for
World War II--serve as backdrop as the actors read the letters. It
provides something to look at, but doesn't alter the work's static
quality.</TE>
<TE>   The play crackles to life, however, when the show's creators take
the liberty of fully dramatizing a letter, or exchange of letters, by
having two characters separated by thousands of miles address each
other directly--as in the case of a World War I wife Goldie Marcellus
(read with wide-eyed sincerity by Nichole Pelerine), who sends her
husband (Tony Abatemarco) a gushing love letter, only to have it
returned with his own acerbic commentary. And while the actors
sometimes go self-consciously stiff in more sober moments, they play
beautifully with the letters' often-surprising humor.</TE>
<TE>   Like Eve Ensler's "The Vagina Monologues," which recently ended a
long run at the Canon, "War Letters" will become a showcase for
revolving stars; it has three permanent cast members and two guest
roles--currently played by smooth Treat Williams and a hoarse-voiced
Mario Van Peebles--that will rotate every few weeks to allow
Hollywood actors the chance to do theater. The creators of "War
Letters" have called it a work in progress, which leaves the door
wide open for improvement.</TE>

<HD>Marcus Roberts: Loose Yet in Control</HD>
<DH>The artist and his trio explore works by Joplin, Morton and
others, then perform a lengthy original suite by Roberts.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DON HECKMAN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The concert by the Marcus Roberts Trio at the CSUN Performing Arts
Center on Sunday evening had some echoes of the Modern Jazz Quartet.
Roberts, like the late pianist John Lewis--longtime music director of
the MJQ--seems to prefer a precisely controlled musical environment.
And his interaction with bassist Roland Guerin and drummer Jason
Marsalis possessed the same sort of synchronous musical qualities
that were a fundamental MJQ attribute.</LD>
<LD>   There were other similarities, as well--the most notable being
Roberts' fascination with musical history, although, in his case, it
is the history of American jazz rather than the classical forms that
Lewis found so compelling.</LD>
<LD>   All those qualities were especially present in the first half of
the program, when the trio offered ragtime tunes (Scott Joplin's "A
Real Slow Drag" and "The Entertainer," a Jelly Roll Morton number
("Jungle Blues"), King Oliver's "West End Blues" and several songs
associated with Louis Armstrong (including "Mack the Knife" and "What
a Wonderful World").</LD>
<TE>   In the ragtime pieces, Roberts, ignoring Joplin's dictum that
there should be no improvising in his compositions, dipped into
thoughtful embellishments and enhancements without sacrificing the
essential qualities of the originals.</TE>
<TE>   In the Armstrong numbers, his lines flowed with the sort of
effervescent enthusiasm Satchmo brought. Marsalis' meticulous
drumming and Guerin's blues-driven bass lines added the perfect
counterpoint, stylistically in sync with Roberts' efforts to
illuminate the different musical genres.</TE>
<TE>   The second half of the bill was less convincing.</TE>
<TE>   Consisting of a single, lengthy Roberts original suite titled
"From Rags to Rhythm," its 12 movements, performed without a break,
lacked sufficient compositional content to sustain interest, despite
superb individual and collective improvising by all members of the
trio.</TE>

<HD>MSNBC's View From Down Below</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELIZABETH JENSEN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Pakistani President Gen. Pervez Musharraf made a crucial visit to
Washington last week and CNN and Fox News Channel carried his many
appearances throughout the day live.</LD>
<LD>   MSNBC? It was airing the women's biathlon competition from the
Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City.</LD>
<LD>   That hardly sounds like the way for the third-place cable news
network to build viewer loyalty, but MSNBC, as a key component in
NBC's strategy to amortize its $545-million Olympics rights fee, had
little choice.</LD>
<TE>   When the January cable news ratings were released, the buzz was
all about Fox News Channel, which passed CNN for the first time in
average total viewers. At NBC, however, it was a wake-up call.</TE>
<TE>   MSNBC, which launched at the same time as Fox in 1996, now ranks a
distant third in the cable news wars. Even though January figures
showed the average number of total viewers watching the channel was
up 23% year to year, Fox and CNN were up more. In 2002 to date, MSNBC
is garnering a mere 18% of prime-time news audience for those three
networks in its key sales demographic of 25- to 54-year-olds.</TE>
<TE>   While NBC executives have long maintained that they are happy with
MSNBC's viewers--who tend to be younger and more affluent than those
watching Fox and CNN--the January ratings provoked a round of
internal debate about just what's gone wrong and how to fix it.</TE>
<TE>   With its corporate parents, General Electric-owned NBC and
Microsoft Corp., MSNBC was given better odds to succeed than Fox. It
had the money, promotional clout and NBC News prestige. Instead,
media industry observers have scratched their heads over the years as
MSNBC has struggled and its programming strategy has flip-flopped.</TE>
<TE>   NBC didn't even really mind being third, executives there say,
because MSNBC is a success financially, allowing millions of dollars
in NBC News costs to be amortized even when the joint venture isn't
making money, as is the current case. But now that the advertising
market is starting to pick up, MSNBC isn't in a strong position to
cash in because it has let its news business slide.</TE>
<TE>   "MSNBC isn't a must-buy network in the news arena," said Stacey
Lynn Koerner, senior vice president and director of broadcast
research at Initiative Media North America.</TE>
<TE>   As it turned out, the advantage of having well-known parents has
turned out to carry some disadvantages too. Instead of creating a
channel that strives to be the best it can be, executives at MSNBC
must consider decisions in light of their effect on other NBC
properties.</TE>
<TE>   So when CNN hired Paula Zahn in September to anchor a new morning
program (Fox already had one), MSNBC also thought about jumping into
the battle in response to heightened interest in news, industry
sources say. Yet in the end, executives decided to stick with a
simulcast of Don Imus' radio program to avoid stealing viewers from
NBC's top-rated "Today" show. Both the Fox and CNN morning time
periods are up sharply in the ratings.</TE>
<TE>   Just as serious, MSNBC has failed to develop so-called appointment
shows that can be seen only at a specific time. Both "Hardball With
Chris Matthews" and "The News With Brian Williams" can also be found
on NBC-owned CNBC, with Matthews airing four times a day and Williams
five times. Though NBC makes money because one show fills five hours,
"It does not always lead to individual high ratings," said MSNBC
President Erik Sorenson.</TE>
<TE>   There's no reason, Sorenson said, why Matthews "cannot be in the
same league as [CNN's] Larry King or [Fox News'] Bill O'Reilly, but
we have cannibalized his audience over the years. If you miss him at
7 you can catch him at 9. I'm not even sure day to day when he's on."</TE>
<TE>   MSNBC fares well during periods of breaking news, as it draws on
NBC's correspondent corps. In prime time, however, an initial
strategy of repackaging NBC News material from "Dateline" and "Today"
into taped shows such as "Headliners &amp; Legends" worked for the bottom
line but didn't make sense when viewers wanted to know about big
stories.</TE>
<TE>   With CNN grabbing the straight news audience by dint of its
longevity and Fox having successfully snagged opinion viewers, MSNBC
finds itself playing catch-up on both strategies--airing Williams'
serious newscast early in the evening, following with media darling
Ashleigh Banfield, then switching gears to talk from conservative
former presidential candidate Alan Keyes. "It's neither fish nor
fowl," said one industry executive.</TE>
<TE>   Over the years, NBC has rarely used its promotional muscle to
funnel viewers toward MSNBC. Nor has money been forthcoming to
advertise the channel on cable and in newspapers, as Fox News Channel
does aggressively. Even CNN, which shunned advertising for most of
its two decades, recently began running ads for Zahn and Aaron Brown.</TE>
<TE>   "We've not spent the tens of millions our competitors have,"
Sorenson said, putting MSNBC's spending on  advertising  around $1
million in the last three years.</TE>
<TE>   For all the problems, MSNBC still pulls in about the same amount
of ad revenue as Fox, around $100 million annually, according to
industry estimates, partly because it is sold in a package with NBC
News. The cable channel also helped propel MSNBC.com to become the
No. 1 Internet news site as of January 1999, according to Media
Metrix figures, though that changed in September, with CNN surging
ahead after the terrorist attacks and holding the lead through the
end of the year.</TE>
<TE>   "CNN is a huge breaking-news brand," said Steve White, MSNBC.com's
chief technology officer, noting that MSNBC.com moved back into first
place in January as coverage of the terrorism story subsided.</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, MSNBC provides intangible benefits for NBC News, serving
as an outlet for Williams to hone his skills as the
replacement-in-waiting for "Nightly News" anchor Tom Brokaw and
giving more exposure to such network stars as correspondent Dan
Abrams. But so far, MSNBC hasn't really served as a talent farm team,
although John Seigenthaler did jump from MSNBC to the network.</TE>
<TE>   Sorenson said the lack of spending  for high-priced talent and
promotion has been "a conscious decision by our company" against
"spending wildly in an ad recession."</TE>
<TE>   With the ad market showing signs of life, however, Sorenson added,
"It has me concerned, and I think my bosses concerned, that we need
to start getting more aggressive about spending on this channel."</TE>
<TE>   A round of advertising for the channel is planned, though Sorenson
declined to say how much or when. More important, debate is underway
about making Williams' and Matthews' shows exclusive to either MSNBC
or CNBC.</TE>
<TE>   "The idea of sharing, everyone agrees, has become outmoded,"
Sorenson said. Still, there is no guarantee that MSNBC will get both
shows, as CNBC is in the midst of its own ratings slump and arguably
more important to NBC because it is fully owned by the company.</TE>
<TE>   MSNBC "is still in the hunt," Sorenson said. "I think advertisers
understand that we have the best audience out there." NBC executives
also note that the Olympics deal allowed MSNBC to sign up more cable
operators to carry it and hope that the increased number of viewers
watching the Games will come back for news.</TE>
<TE>   MSNBC is unlikely to return for now to taped programming in prime
time. The Fox model, Sorenson said, "is more attractive and sustains
longer viewing levels for their fans than ours does," meaning the
month-old hiring of Keyes, which so far has not been a ratings
success, signals the direction that MSNBC intends to go.</TE>
<TE>   "The program is evolving," Sorenson said. "We're going to stick
with it."</TE>

<HD>New Technology Captures the Old</HD>
<DH>Video* A set of five DVDs contains many of the earliest
filmed images. Some of the programs are mildly blue, but most prove
fascinating.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SUSAN KING</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In the fascinating new five-DVD set "The Movies Begin," there are
several examples of "blue movies" produced by American Mutoscope and
Biograph studios in the early 1900s. Of course, these "peep shows"
are incredibly tame by today's standards. But back in 1908, "Fire in
a Burlesque Theatre," "Airy Fairy Lillian Tries on Her New Corsets,"
"From Show Girl to Burlesque Queen" and "Troubles of a Manager of a
Burlesque Show" were considered pretty hot stuff.</LD>
<LD>   The first disc of the Kino set, "The Great Train Robbery and Other
Primary Works," also includes animated renderings of Eadweard
Muybridge's primitive motion studies from 1877-85. And a majority of
the studies feature women in the full monty.</LD>
<LD>   "Almost every new media has started with what passed as
pornography at the time," says David Shepard, who preserved and
restored the films on three volumes of the set. The British Film
Archive was responsible for the two other discs in the Kino set: "The
European Pioneers" and "Experimentation and Discovery."</LD>
<TE>   This extensive study of the genesis of the motion picture was
originally released on VHS format seven years ago, and three of its
volumes, "The Great Train Robbery," "The Magic of Melies" and
"Comedy, Spectacle and New Horizons," are also available on Image as
part of its "Landmarks of Early Film" series. However, the Kino
versions include more films.</TE>
<TE>   Prior to this set, which arrives in stores today (suggested price:
$100), the films had been available on video but only in terrible
copies, says Shepard. Especially the films of the French pioneer who
made "A Trip to the Moon."</TE>
<TE>   "The Georges Melies films were a real triumph," says Shepard. "The
Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences had these beautiful
35-millimeter film fine grain [copies] that had been made in the
1940s from the original negatives. I was able to make an arrangement
with them to use their fine grains. It took two months to patch up
the fine grains so we could use them. Nobody had ever seen the Melies
films looking that great. Then I had to wait a year for the composer,
Alexander Rannie, because he was busy on other stuff. But it was
worth waiting."</TE>
<TE>   The first volume includes several actualities--short documentaries
that range from "President McKinley at Home" (1897) to "San
Francisco: Aftermath of the Earthquake" (1906) and the gorgeous
"Moscow Clad in Show" (1908).</TE>
<TE>   "Until about 1905, the actualities are what really dominated
film," says Shepard. "The only reason movies went over to fiction was
because when the nickelodeon boon started, they needed to have a
steady supply of product, and you couldn't always count on
interesting actualities happening in time to feed the theaters with
their enormous appetites for titles. So they began to do fiction, and
fictional film eventually dominated."</TE>
<TE>   The most enjoyable disc is "Experimentation and Discovery," which
features films made from 1898-1910 from both the U.S. and Western
Europe. Included are the early works of the inventive British
director-producer Cecil Hepworth, who made such films as  the seminal
1905 thriller "Rescued by Rover," which starred Hepworth's own family
and dog. "That was such a success that they wore out the negative,"
says Shepard. "So they just got his wife and child and dog back and
shot it a second time."</TE>
<TE>   G.H. Crick's "A Visit to Peek Frean and Co.'s Biscuit Works" from
1906 features very sophisticated arc lighting and marks the beginning
of the transition from the primitive actualities to the documentary
style of today.</TE>
<TE>   Also featured on the disc are several enjoyable fantasies from
France's Pathe Freres--including the color-tinted "Ali Baba and the
Forty Thieves" from 1905 and "Aladin, or the Wonderful Lamp" from
1906. And from Edison Manufacturing Co., the first advertising film,
1898's "Dewar's--It's Scotch."</TE>
<TE>   One of Shepard's favorite films is "The Girl and Her Trust," a
1912 romantic thriller from D.W. Griffith featured on the "Comedy,
Spectacle and New Horizons" disc. The film, which was made near the
end of Griffith's tenure with Biograph, focuses on a feisty young
woman (Dorothy Bernard) working at a train station who not only must
hold off the advances of two suitors, but two bandits trying to steal
the station's money box.</TE>
<TE>   The film, says Shepard, spotlights Griffith's technical
virtuosity. "The film has about 135 shots, which is about as much as
you could imagine fitting into one reel," he says. "It's one of
Griffith's most fragmented films."</TE>
<TE>   And it's one filled with sexual undertones. The film, says
Shepard, "is basically a rape metaphor. Griffith buried this stuff
pretty deep, but he was not naive. I have to think he knew he was
making a film that was more than about a money box."</TE>
<TE>   Though Bernard was plucky and spunky in "The Girl and Her Trust,"
Shepard says she didn't make many movies for Griffith. "The
scuttlebutt is that Griffith got her pregnant and sent her away," he
confides. "But I wasn't there, so I don't really know.".</TE>

"From Show Girl to Burlesque Queen" and "Troubles of a Manager of a
Burlesque Show" were considered pretty hot stuff.</LD>
<LD>   The first disc of the Kino set, "The Great Train Robbery and Other
Primary Works," also includes animated renderings of Eadweard
Muybridge's primitive motion studies from 1877-85. And a majority of
the studies feature women in the full monty.</LD>
<LD>   "Almost every new media has started with what passed as
pornography at the time," says David Shepard, who preserved and
restored the films on three volumes of the set. The British Film
Archive was responsible for the two other discs in the Kino set: "The
European Pioneers" and "Experimentation and Discovery."</LD>
<TE>   This extensive study of the genesis of the motion picture was
originally released on VHS format seven years ago, and three of its
volumes, "The Great Train Robbery," "The Magic of Melies" and
"Comedy, Spectacle and New Horizons," are also available on Image as
part of its "Landmarks of Early Film" series. However, the Kino
versions include more films.</TE>
<TE>   Prior to this set, which arrives in stores today (suggested price:
$100), the films had been available on video but only in terrible
copies, says Shepard. Especially the films of the French pioneer who
made "A Trip to the Moon."</TE>
<TE>   "The Georges Melies films were a real triumph," says Shepard. "The
Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences had these beautiful
35-millimeter film fine grain [copies] that had been made in the
1940s from the original negatives. I was able to make an arrangement
with them to use their fine grains. It took two months to patch up
the fine grains so we could use them. Nobody had ever seen the Melies
films looking that great. Then I had to wait a year for the composer,
Alexander Rannie, because he was busy on other stuff. But it was
worth waiting."</TE>
<TE>   The first volume includes several actualities--short documentaries
that range from "President McKinley at Home" (1897) to "San
Francisco: Aftermath of the Earthquake" (1906) and the gorgeous
"Moscow Clad in Snow" (1908).</TE>
<TE>   "Until about 1905, the actualities are what really dominated
film," says Shepard. "The only reason movies went over to fiction was
because when the nickelodeon boon started, they needed to have a
steady supply of product, and you couldn't always count on
interesting actualities happening in time to feed the theaters with
their enormous appetites for titles. So they began to do fiction, and
fictional film eventually dominated."</TE>
<TE>   The most enjoyable disc is "Experimentation and Discovery," which
features films made from 1898-1910 from both the U.S. and Western
Europe. Included are the early works of the inventive British
director-producer Cecil Hepworth, who made such films as  the seminal
1905 thriller "Rescued by Rover," which starred Hepworth's own family
and dog. "That was such a success that they wore out the negative,"
says Shepard. "So they just got his wife and child and dog back and
shot it a second time."</TE>
<TE>   G.H. Crick's "A Visit to Peek Frean and Co.'s Biscuit Works" from
1906 features very sophisticated arc lighting and marks the beginning
of the transition from the primitive actualities to the documentary
style of today.</TE>
<TE>   Also featured on the disc are several enjoyable fantasies from
France's Pathe Freres--including the color-tinted "Ali Baba and the
Forty Thieves" from 1905 and "Aladin, or the Wonderful Lamp" from
1906. And from Edison Manufacturing Co., the first advertising film,
1898's "Dewar's--It's Scotch."</TE>
<TE>   One of Shepard's favorite films is "The Girl and Her Trust," a
1912 romantic thriller from D.W. Griffith featured on the "Comedy,
Spectacle and New Horizons" disc. The film, which was made near the
end of Griffith's tenure with Biograph, focuses on a feisty young
woman (Dorothy Bernard) working at a train station who not only must
hold off the advances of two suitors, but two bandits trying to steal
the station's money box.</TE>
<TE>   The film, says Shepard, spotlights Griffith's technical
virtuosity. "The film has about 135 shots, which is about as much as
you could imagine fitting into one reel," he says. "It's one of
Griffith's most fragmented films."</TE>
<TE>   And it's one filled with sexual undertones. The film, says
Shepard, "is basically a rape metaphor. Griffith buried this stuff
pretty deep, but he was not naive. I have to think he knew he was
making a film that was more than about a money box."</TE>
<TE>   Though Bernard was plucky and spunky in "The Girl and Her Trust,"
Shepard says she didn't make many movies for Griffith. "The
scuttlebutt is that Griffith got her pregnant and sent her away," he
confides. "But I wasn't there, so I don't really know."</TE>

<HD>A Provocative Literary Sensation</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOSH FRIEDMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Unlike the nameless hero of his landmark novel, Ralph Ellison was no
"Invisible Man." When his searing, surreal tale of a young black
man's quest for identity in racist America was published in 1952,
Ellison became a literary sensation. But like the hero's grandfather,
whose raspy deathbed rant lingers throughout the novel, Ellison was a
constant puzzle.</LD>
<LD>   The author's devotees and detractors get their due in a frank and
lively "American Masters" presentation, "Ralph Ellison: An American
Journey" (9 p.m. on KCET, KVCR).</LD>
<LD>   Ellison portrayed the black experience with a complexity unseen in
earlier works of so-called protest fiction. He stretched the bounds
of the novel and helped shape racial discourse. Says Harvard
professor Cornel West: "It is impossible to be a serious student of
American culture and Afro-American culture without going through
Ellison. He is the brook of fire through which one must pass."</LD>
<TE>   Yet Ellison's flame burned too coolly for some. His quiet rage
dismayed those who wanted a call to revolution, not a call for
introspection. Says author and activist Amiri Baraka: "Ellison is a
very skillful craftsman. But the most dangerous thing in the world is
a very skilled craftsman with very backward ideas."</TE>
<TE>   Ellison felt unjustly stung by "Uncle Tom" accusations. He
struggled for decades on a second novel, a sweeping look at the
American experience through the lens of race. It proved to be his
elusive whale, although an excerpt was published as the novel
"Juneteenth" in 1999, five years after his death.</TE>
<TE>   Through it all, Ellison wrote provocative essays and never faded
from the literary scene. As one scholar puts it, "His reputation
seemed to grow with every novel he didn't write."</TE>

<HD>The Rhapsody Continues as Troupe Keeps Tapping</HD>
<DH>Dance * With its program in Costa Mesa on Saturday,
L.A.-based company celebrates its longevity and its voice.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRIS PASLES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>There are harder things to do in the Southland than create and keep a
dance company going, but doing that has to rank right up there on the
Don Quixote list of impossible dreams.</LD>
<LD>   So how has Linda Sohl-Donnell managed it? Her Los Angeles-based
Rhapsody in Taps troupe will celebrate its 20th anniversary season
Saturday with a program at Orange Coast College in Costa Mesa.</LD>
<LD>   Sohl-Donnell and Toni Relin were graduate dance students at UCLA
who began working together and decided to form a company.</LD>
<TE>   "We were young, we were inexperienced," Sohl-Donnell said recently
from her studio in Long Beach. "We called the company 'LTD/Unlimited
Dance Company' because we truly were not looking to have any limits.
... We just wanted a vehicle to produce our work in concert."</TE>
<TE>   Their early work reflected Relin's interest in theater pieces and
Sohl-Donnell's in rhythm tap. But after Relin retired in 1984, the
company became all tap. Sohl-Donnell changed the name to Rhapsody in
Taps in 1986.</TE>
<TE>   "In the early phase, my personal obstacle was how to find my own
voice," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Sohl-Donnell had studied and later would perform with legendary
tappers such as Foster Johnson, Charles "Honi" Coles, Buster Brown
and Eddie Brown, among others.</TE>
<TE>   Early reviews typically compared her and her
dancers--unfavorably-- to those dancers.</TE>
<TE>   "But we were coming along several generations later with a totally
different experience of dance," she said. "Why would I try to dance
like Sandman Sims? That's his identity. The whole history and
heritage of tap is to try to find our own voice. Or as earlier
dancers would say, 'Find your own gimmick.'</TE>
<TE>   "So to be compared to those men, people didn't get it. To this day
they don't hear the musical thing [we do] at all.</TE>
<TE>   "Musical aspects are not discussed, only visual information. ...
Reviewers are used to picking up on movement; no mention of, say, the
African polyrhythms."</TE>
<TE>   The problem was that Sohl-Donnell was experimenting with adding
elements of modern dance--new choreographic moves and structures,
shifts of weight and color to create phrases and melody. She was also
branching out to include world music.</TE>
<TE>   But audiences liked what she was doing.</TE>
<TE>   "We've sold out at Orange Coast College at least six years in a
row," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Still, "box office never pays for a self-produced concert,'' she
said. Other difficulties include keeping dancers when they get offers
from others, coordinating musicians' schedules (since 1985, the
troupe has danced to live music) as well as juggling dancers'
schedules.</TE>
<TE>   The company has managed to keep going by eliminating overhead (it
has no office) and running with a skeleton staff of Sohl-Donnell,
administrative director Kay Davis and a dedicated board.</TE>
<TE>   It has received funding and support from the City of Los Angeles
Cultural Affairs Department, Panasonic Corp., the Irvine Foundation,
the Japan America Theater and Orange Coast College.</TE>
<TE>   "We are an independent company from Orange Coast College, but
without their support, it is possible we would not still be here,"
said Sohl-Donnell.</TE>
<TE>   The Irvine Foundation gave Sohl-Donnell a $30,000 choreographer's
grant in 1999. A year later, she received a $15,000 phase two grant
to continue her work.</TE>
<TE>   The company consists of a core of seven dancers and five jazz
musicians. But for the anniversary program, several guests--including
Arthur Duncan and Althea Waites--will be coming as well.</TE>
<TE>   "Getting ready for this concert has really been a labor of love,"
said Sohl-Donnell. "I've reviewed all these videotapes to decide what
pieces I wanted to reproduce and reconstruct. It's strange. I don't
normally speak like this. But I'm very proud. I'm very pleased with
the body of work--not only my choreography, but work that the company
has created."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   * Rhapsody in Taps will dance its 20th anniversary performance
Saturday at 8 p.m. in the Robert B. Moore Theatre, Orange Coast
College, 2701 Fairview Road, Costa Mesa. $23, in advance; $29, at the
door. (714) 432-5880.</TE>

<HD>Andersons to Buy Century City Tower</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BRAD BERTON</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Los Angeles businessman John E. Anderson's real estate acquisition
spree will soon include his largest purchase to date: a Century City
high-rise. An affiliate of Duesenberg Investment Co., the real estate
group headed by Anderson and his wife, Marion, has agreed to pay
about $185 million for the 28-story tower at 1900 Avenue of the
Stars.</LD>
<LD>   Anderson, whose Topa Equities holding company has owned its
headquarters building at 1800 Avenue of the Stars for many years,
said he considers Avenue of the Stars a top address on the Westside
and expects to achieve some economies as Duesenberg's
property-management arm takes over the tower next door.</LD>
<LD>   The 1900 building is 97% leased after a recent lease signed with
Jeffer Mangels Butler &amp; Marmaro. The law firm's initial annual rental
rate is thought to be in the mid- to high-$30s per square foot. The
600,000-square-foot property also is home to other law firms and
professional tenants, and includes a single-story satellite building.</LD>
<TE>   As brokerage CB Richard Ellis' latest market statistics indicate,
Century City appears to have regained its status as the Westside's
preeminent commercial district. As the technology bubble peaked,
office landlords in Santa Monica and Westwood commanded higher rents
than their Century City counterparts. Now the Westside's strongest
demand is coming from more traditional businesses such as
professional and financial services. CB Richard Ellis' data from the
fourth quarter of 2001 show landlords asking an average of $42 per
square foot annually for Century City offices. Westwood rates are
about $40.70, followed by Santa Monica at about $39.25.</TE>
<TE>   "I think Century City remains the L.A. Basin's real central
business district; it just wasn't affected much by the dot-com
fallout," said office broker Stan Gerlach at CB Richard Ellis. "The
corporate and institutional environments are back in vogue," added
Gerlach, who recently helped negotiate Korn/Ferry International's
short-term lease extension at a Century City high-rise after the
executive recruiting firm considered a move downtown.</TE>
<TE>   The Andersons' Duesenberg group is buying the 1900 tower from a
venture between San Jose-based Divco West Properties and New York
investment advisor Westbrook Partners. That partnership bought the
building and its 20-story counterpart at 1901 Avenue of the Stars for
around $200 million in the spring of 1999. An investment fund managed
by Santa Monica-based Douglas Emmett &amp; Co. bought the 1901 building
last summer for about $150 million.</TE>
<TE>   Anderson said he is willing to consider more Southern California
acquisitions, but he's already made nearly a quarter-billion dollars'
worth of recent local investments, plus a $95-million purchase of one
of Hawaii's biggest office properties late last year. "It's important
that we focus on digesting these [acquisitions] and making sure we
take good care of our new tenants and properties," he said.</TE>

<HD>Ciena to Buy ONI Systems for $900 Billion in Stock</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Ciena Corp., the second-largest U.S. maker of fiber-optic telephone
equipment, will buy rival ONI Systems Corp. for $900 billion in stock
and the assumption of $300 million in debt in a plan to add sales in
one of the only rising communications-gear markets, Ciena spokesman
Glenn Jasper said.</LD>
<LD>   The bid values ONI shares, down 87% in the last year, at about
$6.20, a 12% premium to Friday's closing price.</LD>
<LD>   Analysts expect both companies to lose money for two years as
customers such as Qwest Communications International Inc. pare
equipment spending. ONI is smaller than Ciena and specializes in gear
that boosts capacity on citywide fiber networks, one of the few areas
in which analysts expect spending to increase in 2002.</LD>
<TE>   "I don't think the near-term prospects for either company were
that good," said John Wilson, an RBC Capital Markets analyst who has
a "sector perform" rating on Ciena and doesn't own shares. "If the
industry environment was anything close to normal, you probably
wouldn't see a deal like this."</TE>
<TE>   Ciena, based in Linthicum, Md., is expected to have a loss of 66
cents a share in the fiscal year ending in October and 31 cents the
year after, the average estimates of analysts polled by IBES
International Inc. San Jose-based ONI is forecast to have losses of
65 cents a share this calendar year and 50 cents in 2003.</TE>
<TE>   ONI may catapult Ciena to first place in the market for network
gear in metropolitan areas. ONI's share fell to 26% in the third
quarter from 34% in the second, according to Dell'Oro Group of
Redwood City, Calif. Nortel Networks Corp. ranked first with 37%;
Ciena was third with 22%.</TE>

<HD>Second Phase of Ontario Business Park Underway</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Proficiency Capital Corp. of Los Angeles has begun construction of
the 430,000-square-foot second phase of its $50-million Ontario
Gateway West business park near Ontario International Airport .</LD>
<LD>   Construction has begun without a tenant for the 430,000 square
feet of warehouse space, an indication that the developers believe
the demand for Inland Empire industrial space is strong enough that
the new space will be filled by the time it is completed or soon
thereafter, said Jeffrey Trenton, president of Proficiency.</LD>
<LD>   General contractor for the second phase of the 60-acre business
park is Oltmans Construction Co. of Whittier, which also built the
958,000-square-foot first phase.</LD>
<TE>   Construction of Phase 2 is due to be finished by midyear,
according to Lori Woodcock, project manager for Oltmans. Architect
for the project is Lee &amp; Sakahara of Irvine.</TE>
<TE>   When the second phase is completed, Trenton said, it will be

<HD>Eisner on the Defensive as Disney Shareholders Meet</HD>
<DH>Entertainment: The firm is struggling in certain key
divisions, but many say it is making the right moves.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD VERRIER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As shareholders gather today in Hartford, Conn., for the company's
annual meeting, Walt Disney Co. Chief Executive Michael Eisner may
face a tough crowd.</LD>
<LD>   Disney is struggling in many of its key divisions: ABC, the No. 1
television broadcast network two years ago, now is stuck in third
place. Last year Disney, a movie box-office leader for many years,
fell to fourth place in market share in North America, according to
ACNielsen EDI Inc. And the sharp drop in air travel after last fall's
terrorist attacks slowed business at Disney's theme parks, which
account for one-third of the company's operating income and were
already experiencing a slowdown.</LD>
<LD>   The poor results have put Eisner, architect of the firm's storied
turnaround in the 1980s and 1990s, in the unusual spot of being on
the defensive. Even though Disney's stock price has rebounded since
Sept. 11, the shares are stuck at 1996 prices. On Friday, Disney
shares fell 34 cents to close at $23.90 on the New York Stock
Exchange.</LD>
<TE>   "When you consider where we've grown over the last five years ...
the problems are fixable, minimal and not substantial," Eisner said
in an interview Friday. "The overriding message is that our company
is in great shape."</TE>
<TE>   Many analysts say Eisner and his lieutenants are making the right
moves to manage through the slump. To operate more efficiently,
Disney has shut 50 stores, cut costs at its movie studio, reduced
operating hours at theme parks and eliminated 4,000 jobs. Eisner
recently tapped ABC executive Susan Lyne to reinvigorate ABC's
prime-time lineup.</TE>
<TE>   "We're [only] a hit or two away from bringing the prime-time
schedule at ABC to where we want to be," Eisner said.</TE>
<TE>   But such measures have not mollified some investors, who have
grown impatient with the company's performance.</TE>
<TE>   "We just felt uncertainty around travel post-Sept. 11 was going to
create head winds for [Disney's] theme park business. That was one
thing we had always counted on,'' said John Waterman, chief
investment officer for Rittenhouse Financial, an investment
management firm in Radnor, Pa. Rittenhouse sold its remaining Disney
stake in September. "There just wasn't anything from an earnings
perspective that we could [count] on in the next year because all of
their businesses had uncertainty.''</TE>
<TE>   Some investors wonder whether Eisner can again turn around Disney.
"Almost everywhere you look, every [Disney] division is
under-performing," one money manager said.</TE>
<TE>   Other investors say Eisner has made the best of a bad situation,
noting that many of the company's woes are due to economic conditions
beyond its control.</TE>
<TE>   "Beyond ABC, I think they get pretty good marks," said Larry
Haverty, fund manager at State Street Research &amp; Management, which
owns Disney stock.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a company that could have easily overreacted to Sept. 11
something fierce. They could have hit the panic button and they
didn't."</TE>
<TE>   Fred Fromm, an analyst with Franklin Templeton Investments, agrees
and predicts Disney's consumer products and theme park businesses
will turn the corner by next year.</TE>
<TE>   "We think a lot of the problems are behind us," said Disney
President Bob Iger. "If you look at the company's performance over
the last five years we are a substantially different and vastly
improved company."</TE>
<TE>   Iger cited the addition of theme parks in Anaheim; Orlando, Fla.;
Paris; and Tokyo; the success of Radio Disney and the growth of the
company's television and cable business since the 1996 acquisition of
Capital Cities/ABC. "We believe that when the economy rebounds and
advertising and tourism improve, we'll be in great shape," Iger said.</TE>
<TE>   After shuttering its Go.com Internet portal last year at a cost of
more than $800 million, Disney has refocused its Internet business,
which the company predicts will break even by year end. And the
company's consumer products division, which also has been
reorganized, is on a growth path, Iger said.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to issues of financial performance, Eisner will be
confronted today with various shareholder proposals.</TE>
<TE>   One resolution calls for Disney to adopt a code of conduct for
manufacturers in China under which the company and its suppliers
would abide by international labor standards. Another calls for
Disney to report on its theme park safety guidelines and all ride
injuries over the last two years. And a shareholder activist group is
backing a resolution that would restrict any Disney officer from
receiving more than 5% of the total stock options granted in a given
year. In 1996, Disney granted Eisner 24 million stock options, or 26%
of the total options that year.</TE>

<LD>Demand for most classes of commercial property will remain stable in
Southern California this year and will probably not rise much before
year-end, said speakers at the annual UCLA Extension/Los Angeles
Times commercial real estate forecast last week in Beverly Hills.</LD>
<LD>   The region's fundamentally sound economy will prevent demand for
office and industrial space from dropping much more than it already
has, speakers said, while the Southland's housing shortage ensures
that apartment buildings will remain filled with renters.</LD>
<LD>   Despite the downturn, commercial properties in Southern California
remain attractive to investors, said Roy March, president of
investment advisory firm Eastdil Realty Co. March and others at the
conference said large institutional investors, particularly pension
funds, consider apartment buildings and industrial properties in
Southern California to be stable investments in times of economic
uncertainty.</LD>
<TE>   Investors are less sanguine about office properties, according to
the conference consensus, but experts believe demand for office space
will eventually increase after falling off substantially in the last
year.</TE>
<TE>   The event included the presentation of the annual UCLA
Extension/Los Angeles Times Real Estate Forecast Award. This year's
winner was developer Jerry Snyder of J.H. Snyder Co., whose 50-year
career includes such projects as Museum Square and Wilshire Courtyard
in the Miracle Mile district of Los Angeles, the Water Garden office
project in Santa Monica and the Bridge shopping center at Howard
Hughes Center in Westchester.</TE>

<HD>More Firms Carrying Health Costs</HD>
<DH>Benefits: Rising premiums are forcing smaller and smaller
employers to dump insurers and assume workers' medical expenses
themselves.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RONALD D. WHITE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Faced with health insurance cost increases of as much as 20% this
year, many companies are dumping their traditional HMOs and switching
to self-insurance to better manage costs while providing medical care
for their employees.</LD>
<LD>   But self-insurance, in which the employer assumes the brunt of the
financial risks, comes with its own potential problems. That was
illustrated last month in California when the self-insured Sunkist
Growers &amp; Packers Benefit Plan Trust went bankrupt after it was clear
that medical claims would far exceed the trust's ability to pay. That
briefly left 23,000 farm workers scrambling to find new insurance.</LD>
<LD>   Unlike traditional health coverage, in which employers pay an
upfront premium to an insurer, companies that self-insure save that
money and pay the health-care providers only when medical claims come
in. The employer assumes the financial risk of providing benefits to
employees in exchange for greater control and potential savings. It
sets up a reserve or trust fund to pay those claims.</LD>
<TE>   Self-funded insurance has long been used by large multi-state
employers that can manage the risk of heavy medical claims better
than smaller companies. About two-thirds of the nation's largest
employers employ some form of self-insurance, experts say. The big
employers also avoid a bewildering array of state insurance
regulations when they self-insure and avoid insurance premiums and
taxes. But now many mid-size and smaller employers also are willing
to take on the risks of self-funding. And with costs of health
maintenance organizations rising as fast as or faster than
traditionally more expensive health plans, the percentage of
employers that are self-funding their HMO coverage also is on the
rise, having climbed from 6% to 13% from 2000 to 2001, according to a
survey by William M. Mercer Inc.</TE>
<TE>   One company that recently switched to self-funding is Flat Rock
Furniture in the rural Indiana town of Waldron, a company of about 75
workers. Owner Van McQueen said that less than two weeks before the
close of enrollment, his company's health insurer proposed a rate
increase of 80%.</TE>
<TE>   "When I heard that, I got busy," said McQueen, who was unwilling
to give up a company staple: 100% health coverage for each of his
employees and their dependents. McQueen hired a third-party
administrator to help him run a self-insurance program.</TE>
<TE>   Now McQueen says his company is building up a cash reserve while
saving about 20% in premiums and is protected from severe medical
claims by so-called stop-loss or excess insurance.</TE>
<TE>   "We're just a little Podunk company, but we can fight back,"
McQueen said.</TE>
<TE>   Service Rock Products, a Victorville company that provides
construction materials for highways and buildings, switched to
self-insurance seven years ago. It has only 171 employees and lacks
the deep pockets of a Fortune 500-size company that could withstand a
surge in medical bills. Dan Scorza, the company's vice president for
administration, sees few alternatives for keeping his employees
covered.</TE>
<TE>   Even under self-funded insurance, Scorza's company has seen more
than a 51% increase in health-care costs for its single employees
since it switched to self-funding in 1995 and a nearly 71% increase
for families over the same period.</TE>
<TE>   Without self-funding, Scorza said, the costs would be even higher
and "we would lose flexibility and our employees would lose benefits.
We just couldn't afford it."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Insufficient Reserves Sank Sunkist Trust</TE>
<TE>   But these smaller employers must keep a wary eye on their
projections. Big corporations can weather unanticipated
problems--such as a spate of premature babies--long enough for
subsequent premium increases to absorb the financial blow. Smaller
companies can't afford such mistakes, which is why secondary
stop-loss insurance, which kicks in when claims exceed a certain
preset amount, can be essential to a careful strategy.</TE>
<TE>   Although the reasons remain in hot dispute, it was the inability
to track the amount of medical claims and the lack of a sufficient
reserve that ultimately deep-sixed the Sunkist trust.</TE>
<TE>   In a report released last week to the state Senate and Assembly
insurance committees, it was confirmed that the trust's problems were
apparent as early as last June. By the time the Department of
Insurance cobbled together a recovery plan involving higher premiums,
benefits restructuring and other measures, it already was too late.</TE>
<TE>   Sunkist's situation may illustrate the perils of self-insurance,
but it's also partly a reflection on California's system of "multiple
employer welfare arrangements," which is different from
self-insurance plans in most of the rest of the nation.</TE>
<TE>   According to officials in the state's Insurance Department, MEWAs
are rather loosely subject to state regulations and requirements, but
those requirements aren't nearly as tough as those set for insurance
companies licensed to do business in California.</TE>
<TE>   For example, insurance firms operating here are required to have
$5 million in capital available in the event of unforeseen problems,
said Norris Clark, the state's deputy commissioner of financial
surveillance. For MEWAs, the requirement is only $1 million.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Large Employers Seek to Consolidate, Simplify</TE>
<TE>   Only six states, including California, have MEWAs or some
variation on them. Virtually every other form of self-funded
insurance is federally regulated under the Employee Retirement Income
Security Act. That's one of the reasons large employers prefer
self-funding, because it alleviates the need to follow various state
regulations.</TE>
<TE>   Many large employers, meanwhile, either are dropping HMOs to
consolidate, simplify and/or reduce their benefit options or are
streamlining how they work with HMOs. Because doctor and hospital
groups have had such success recently in pushing through fee
increases, HMOs have lost much of their ability to contain costs.</TE>
<TE>   In response, Connecticut-based Xerox Corp. has overhauled its
health coverage, according to Larry Becker, the company's director of
benefits. First, rather than deal separately with 220 HMOs around the
nation, including dozens of Blue Cross, Aetna and Kaiser affiliates,
Xerox decided to expand its self-insurance programs and to negotiate
with only one affiliate of the big managed-care companies, with every
other affiliate expected to go along for the ride. Also, Becker said,
other HMOs, particularly those with the highest cost increases, were
dropped outright.</TE>
<TE>   Becker added that Xerox spends about $300 million a year on health
care and will save on administration, paperwork and premium taxes
because of the self-funding and the streamlining.</TE>
<TE>   Albert Lowey-Ball, who runs a Sacramento management consulting
firm specializing in the managed health-care sector, said, "I expect
this trend toward more self-insurance to accelerate. This is
something that will be good for employers but not to consumers, who
in some cases will see their costs increase and their choices reduced
and their benefits reduced as well."</TE>
<TE>   Becker sees an advantage in that, even if consumers continue to be
dazed by sticker shock.</TE>
<TE>   "We have to get people more involved in the day-to-day decisions
about their health care," Becker said. "Right now, they are too
insulated. They are still in the buffet mentality of health care: You
pay your $10 and it's all you can eat. We have to get to a place
where it's more like gas prices. The noise from consumers will become
deafening. When the real consumer is paying the real bill, they will
have an impact on the price."</TE>

<HD>She Must Rein In Spending to Get a Shot at Early Retirement</HD>
<DH>Diversifying her portfolio, paying off debt and increasing
savings will be the first hurdles.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARK SACHS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Robyn Zander wants to retire early. But if the 37-year-old corporate
executive doesn't learn a lesson from the Enron debacle, she may not
be able to retire at all.</LD>
<LD>   Zander, a fervent horseback rider who hopes to put herself out to
pasture in 10 years or so, has the bulk of her retirement savings
invested in the stock of her former employer, Boeing Co.</LD>
<LD>   Employees at Enron Corp. learned the perils of concentrating too
much of their nest egg in their employer's stock. When the
Houston-based energy company collapsed in December, it took many of
its employees' savings with it.</LD>
<TE>   Regulators estimate Enron's 401(k) plan lost $1 billion as the
company's stock plummeted from $90 to less than $1 a share. Some
workers, much of their savings invested in Enron stock, lost almost
everything.</TE>
<TE>   Boeing, the big aircraft maker and defense contractor, has had its
own problems lately--its stock, though up 16% this year, is down 35%
from its 12-month high. But no one is predicting it will become
another Enron.</TE>
<TE>   Still, San Luis Obispo-based financial planner Judith Martindale
said Zander is taking a big risk by having almost 80% of her
retirement savings in Boeing shares.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a recipe for disaster," Martindale said. "All sectors have
their vulnerabilities, and a diversified portfolio is the best
protection against catastrophic losses."</TE>
<TE>   A lack of diversification isn't the only roadblock standing
between Zander and an early retirement. Not only is her Roth IRA
concentrated in Boeing stock, there's not much of it.</TE>
<TE>   She's put aside only $50,000. And with the days of fat
double-digit returns in the stock market apparently over for the
foreseeable future, it will be tough to see significant growth in
that account--even on her annual salary of more than $100,000.</TE>
<TE>   But the early-retirement dream dies hard.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think I should have to stop living now just because I
want to retire early," Zander said. "And anyway, I'm pretty careful
about spending. I really am fairly frugal."</TE>
<TE>   One of her more costly indulgences is horseback riding. For nearly
two decades, Zander has owned a horse of her own, which she keeps at
a Los Angeles-area stable--at a cost of $500 a month.</TE>
<TE>   "When I'm out riding her, it's my 'safe' place," she says of her
horse, April. "It's pure enjoyment."</TE>
<TE>   During the week, Zander is acting general manager at Dynatek Inc.,
which makes ignition systems for motorcycles. She's also vice
president of Dynatek's general partner, WW Zander Inc., and her
income is divided almost equally between the two.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Encouraged to Live Within Her Means</TE>
<TE>   For Zander to seriously consider retiring early, Martindale said,
she must either cut her spending and increase her savings
drastically, or find part-time employment in retirement to supplement
her savings.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm always a little cautious when people tell me they can live
much less expensively than they're living now," said Martindale,
noting that Zander is carrying $10,000 in credit card debt. "She's
making double what she says she needs to live on, but still has debt
and isn't saving."</TE>
<TE>   Zander has about $100,000 in equity on her 1940s-era Pasadena
home, which is valued at about $330,000.</TE>
<TE>   The house is in need of some repairs, such as electrical upgrades
and work on the plumbing system. Zander says she also may add a
bathroom to the house before she eventually sells it and trades up.</TE>
<TE>   Zander says she's willing to work on a limited basis after her
retirement to help pay for any unforeseen expenses, and she has an
impressive array of credentials with which to do so.</TE>
<TE>   Besides a real estate broker's license and her experience as a
corporate executive, Zander holds a bachelor's degree in psychology
from Oregon State University and a recently completed MBA from
Pepperdine.</TE>
<TE>   Some might say she's perfectly positioned to shift her career into
high gear instead of looking for the exit sign. But Zander disagrees.</TE>
<TE>   "I've done nothing but work, go to school or both for my whole
life," she says. "I've lived for my family and for my career but not
for myself. I want to do something for me, and I don't want to wait
forever to do it.</TE>
<TE>   "My mother died last September at 58, and she had worked her whole
life without taking much time off. I don't want that to happen to
me."</TE>
<TE>   Financial planner Martindale says the first order of business for
Zander is to focus on what she wants to do and, more important, how
she intends to do it.</TE>
<TE>   "She mentioned that she's very tired and that she's never taken a
vacation. I suggested that she plan a vacation as soon as possible to
enable her to reflect on her life plan."</TE>
<TE>   Then comes the tough part, the planner said.</TE>
<TE>   "She currently doesn't have any savings other than her Roth IRA,
and ... I'd like to see her build a cash reserve.</TE>
<TE>   "I like people to have 10% of their adjusted gross income
available, which in her case should be at least $10,000."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Putting More Into Her Roth IRA Account</TE>
<TE>   Martindale said Zander should be able to save $500 a month toward
her Roth account and still pay down her credit cards at $500 a month,
paying them off in about two years.</TE>
<TE>   When the debt is out of the way, she should shift that $500
monthly payment to the Roth IRA, boosting her annual contribution to
$12,000 a year.</TE>
<TE>   By the time she's 50, assuming a 7% annual return, the sum would
have grown to more than $300,000. That's a nice appreciation, but not
nearly enough to retire on.</TE>
<TE>   The bottom line: Zander needs to work at least part time after she
turns 50 so she'll have enough money to live on while her Roth IRA
continues to build and she waits for her Boeing pension ($6,000 a
year beginning at age 60) and Social Security ($16,680 a year at 62)
to kick in.</TE>
<TE>   Zander conceded that she may have to settle for a partial early
retirement.</TE>
<TE>   After age 50, she could continue serving as vice president of WW
Zander (where she's making about $50,000 a year as vice president)
just by "popping in" occasionally to check on its various divisions.</TE>
<TE>   "I hope to have enough money to travel, play golf and ride horses
occasionally," she said. "I may have to give up sushi on Friday
nights, though."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Moving Into Mutual Funds and Bonds</TE>
<TE>   Now, about that Roth IRA. Martindale applauded Zander's decision
to roll over the 401(k) she had at Boeing into a Roth IRA after she
left the company.</TE>
<TE>   But having 79% of it--or nearly $40,000 of the $50,300
account--still tied up in Boeing stock is a problem.</TE>
<TE>   "She's open to mutual funds, and my bias strongly favors index
funds due to the lower costs and the diversification," Martindale
said.</TE>
<TE>   Martindale suggests a portfolio that would be 80% equity funds and
20% bonds.</TE>
<TE>   The equity portion would have 40% in large-cap U.S. stocks, 20%
small-cap U.S. stocks and 20% in foreign stocks.</TE>
<TE>   The bond portion would have short-term bonds to best ride the
inflation cycles in the market, Martindale said.</TE>
<TE>   "Although some of the investments I'm recommending are not in
favor now, she would be well-diversified for whatever the world
brings us."</TE>
<TE>   And where does Zander see herself when she turns 50?</TE>
<TE>   Zander isn't ruling out adding a significant other to her
portfolio at some point, but children probably aren't on the agenda.
Waterfront living may be on the horizon, however.</TE>
<TE>   "I want a house with a dock right out on the water," she said.
"But wherever it is, I think my future is bright."</TE>

<CX>   Money Make-Over--The Money Make-Over in Tuesday's Business section
incorrectly advised the subject to put additional savings into a
tax-deferred Roth individual retirement account. Because of limits on
Roth IRA contributions, the subject should have been advised to put the
savings into a taxable investment account.</CX>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Argentina's five neighbors called on the International Monetary Fund
to provide fresh loans to the country as hundreds of depositors
stormed banks in downtown Buenos Aires demanding their savings.</LD>
<LD>   The presidents of Brazil, Uruguay, Chile, Bolivia and Paraguay,
meeting in Buenos Aires, asked the IMF and other lenders to consider
Argentina's request for as much as $20 billion in new assistance to
avert bank failures and spur the economy after a debt default and
currency devaluation.</LD>
<LD>   The plea, made in a joint statement, underscores concern that
Argentina's economic crisis will limit trade and stall economic
growth across the region.</LD>

<HD>Southwest Plans to Add 4,000 to Work Force</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Southwest Airlines, which bucked the trend of layoffs and flight
reductions after Sept. 11, plans to hire about 4,000 workers this
year.</LD>
<LD>   The help-wanted sign at Southwest contrasts with grim news from
other airlines. While a few are calling back some of the workers they
laid off last fall, none are talking about creating new jobs.
Dallas-based Southwest is the only major U.S. airline still making
money.</LD>
<LD>   The largest carriers, AMR Corp.'s American and UAL Corp.'s United,
lost $3.8 billion between them last year. Southwest, however, was not
immune to the slowdown in business travel that started in 2001 or the
steep decline in travel after the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11.</LD>
<TE>   It put growth plans on hold and delayed aircraft orders. In
December, Southwest announced it would take possession of two new
Boeing 737s--the first additions to its fleet since the terrorist
attacks.</TE>
<TE>   But the hiring plans are Southwest's strongest indication that it
believes it can regain its previous double-digit growth. Southwest,
which has 33,000 employees, says it plans to hire 250 pilots, 1,200
flight attendants and 2,600 other workers. Executives said that would
match the hiring pace the airline had expected last year.</TE>
<TE>   Southwest said the new jobs would be spread across the 59 airports
where it operates and at nine reservations centers around the
country. Officials said the greatest need for workers was in
Baltimore, Chicago and Oakland.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>As companies take a more active role in educating their workers, the
steady rise in the number of sexual harassment cases reported during
the mid-1990s appears to have leveled off.</LD>
<LD>   Figures from the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission show that
the number of cases filed with it and 90 other human rights agencies
rose from 10,532 in fiscal 1992 to 15,549 in 1995. Cases reached a
peak of 15,889 in 1997 and then leveled off at 15,836 in 2000.</LD>
<LD>   EEOC data reveal an increase in cases brought by men from 1992 to
2000-- from 9.1% of the total to 13.6%.</LD>

<LD>   "I have more work than I have trades to perform it," said Thomas
Schievelbein, president of the Newport News Shipbuilding unit of
Century City-based Northrop Grumman. "I just have to work through
that."</LD>
<LD>   More workers are leaving now than at any other time in recent
memory, union officials said.</LD>
<TE>   "I've not seen any numbers like this before," said Arnold Outlaw,
president of the United Steelworkers of America Local 8888.</TE>
<TE>   Employees, particularly those who handle nuclear and radioactive
material, are leaving for other jobs, especially at the Norfolk Naval
Shipyard, the union said.</TE>
<TE>   Some also are taking advantage of increased pensions.</TE>
<TE>   The Virginia shipyard recently signed a contract to build the 10th
Nimitz-class aircraft carrier, known as CVN-77, as it wraps up work
on the carrier Ronald Reagan.</TE>
<TE>   It is also refueling a third carrier, the Eisenhower, planning for
the next generation of carriers, the CVNX, and refitting the first
U.S. nuclear-powered carrier, the Enterprise.</TE>
<TE>   It also has contracts with General Dynamics Corp.'s Electric Boat
division to build the first four Virginia-class attack submarines.</TE>
<TE>   Newport News, the nation's only builder of nuclear aircraft
carriers, became part of Northrop on Nov. 30 in a $2.1-billion
takeover.</TE>

<HD>Crude Falls on Rising U.S. Reserves</HD>
<DH>Oil: Concerns of an attack on Iraq are outweighed by the
amount available.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Crude oil prices fell 2.6% on expectations that Wednesday's industry
report will show a sixth rise in seven weeks in U.S. gasoline
supplies.</LD>
<LD>   U.S. reserves of motor fuel are now about 6.9% above last year's
levels, leaving refining profits at about a quarter of year-ago
levels. That's outweighing concern the U.S. will disrupt Middle East
supplies by attacking Iraq in its war on terrorism.</LD>
<LD>   "Gasoline is the key," said Orrin Middleton, an energy analyst at
Barclays Capital in London. "Another rise in U.S. gasoline and the
high stockpiles will outweigh fear of Iraq."</LD>
<TE>   Brent crude oil for April settlement fell 54 cents, or 2.6%, to
$20.33 a barrel on the International Petroleum Exchange in London.
Brent, the benchmark for two-thirds of the world's oil, rose 5.8%
last week on concern of bombing.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. retail gasoline prices fell 0.9cent to $1.107 a gallon in the
week ended Feb. 11, the Department of Energy said in its latest
survey of 900 filling stations. The average U.S. price for regular
gasoline was 36.9 cents, or 25%, lower than a year ago, the survey
showed. Gasoline reached a 21/2-year low of $1.059 on Dec. 17.</TE>
<TE>   The profit from processing three barrels of crude into two of
gasoline and one of heating oil last week plunged 40%, or 70 cents,
to $1.05 a barrel, down 72%.</TE>
<TE>   Secretary of State Colin L. Powell said the U.S. is capable of
striking unilaterally at Iraq in the fight against terrorism. Still,
it would be more difficult to depose the Iraqi regime without support
from the Europeans, Russians and Arabs in the region, Powell said on
NBC's "Meet the Press."</TE>
<TE>   Saudi and Syrian leaders said they wouldn't support any attacks
against Iraq, hindering U.S. efforts to build a coalition against
Saddam Hussein. Saudi Crown Prince Abdullah said any attack on Iraq
or Iran shouldn't be contemplated because it would not serve the
interests of America, the region or the world, the New York Times
reported.</TE>
<TE>   Concern that the U.S. may attack Iraq, the Middle East's
third-largest oil shipper, produced crude oil's biggest rise in six
weeks.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. market was closed for the Presidents Day holiday. The
American Petroleum Institute will report oil inventories Wednesday
and the Department of Energy releases its data Thursday.</TE>

<HD>NBC Scores With Youth, West Coast</HD>
<DH>Olympics: Skating scandal and interest in U.S. hockey, Ohno
help ratings. Games propel network into first place for the season.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GREG JOHNSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>NBC cited strong interest among younger viewers and people living on
the West Coast for strong ratings of the Winter Games through Sunday
night's broadcasts from Salt Lake City. The network also benefited
from the pairs skating medals scandal, Saturday's highly rated U.S.
hockey game against Russia and growing interest in speed skater Apolo
Anton Ohno.</LD>
<LD>   As many as 180 million Americans are expected to tune in to the
network by the time the Olympic flame is extinguished Sunday  night.</LD>
<LD>   "The fact is, women's figure skating, normally the highlight of
the Winter Games, hasn't even started yet," Randy Falco, president of
NBC Television, said during a teleconference Monday. "We're bullish
about where we've been and where we're going."</LD>
<TE>   The latest ratings were good news for NBC, which paid $545million
for broadcasting rights and earlier hit its goal of selling
$720million in Olympic advertising. The strong ratings midway through
the Olympics has helped NBC jump into first place for the broadcast
season.</TE>
<TE>   The number of households watching Winter Games coverage grew by
10% over CBS' average during the Nagano Games in 1998, according to
NBC. The network, which has actively promoted its broadcasts to
younger viewers, enjoyed a 17% increase in viewing among those ages
18 to 24.</TE>
<TE>   Households that tune in to NBC are spending 90 minutes  to two
hours each day watching, an increase of 6% from  CBS' coverage in
1998. The MSNBC and CNBC cable operations, which broadcast hockey
games and other contests, also are enjoying a noticeable increase in
viewers.</TE>
<TE>   Viewership among West Coast residents is 8% stronger than the
national average, according to NBC. The strong showing has blunted
criticism of NBC, which opted to delay broadcasts of some key events
and show them later on tape.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. hockey team's 2-2 tie with Russia on Saturday turned into
the highest-rated hockey game of any kind--Olympics or NHL--to be
broadcast on American television since the 1980 "Miracle On Ice"
during the Lake Placid Games.</TE>
<TE>   NBC also has benefited from a decision to trim this year's
broadcasts  to 31/2 hours each night, down from five hours when CBS
broadcast the Nagano Games. Falco said it's "asking a lot" to expect
viewers to turn on television sets at 7 p.m. for a five-hour
broadcast.</TE>
<TE>   NBC's ratings announcement was well received by advertisers using
the broadcasts as a conduit to younger consumers. "This is a very
important audience for us, and you're seeing that events like
freestyle aerials, the moguls and snowboarding have been a great
draw," said Visa USA spokesman Joe Carberry. "NBC's numbers show that
the Olympics is a great platform to reach these people."</TE>

<HD>More Massages at a Mall Near You</HD>
<DH>Real estate: Day spa operators are focusing on shopping
centers to attract patrons with saunas and steam rooms.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BOB HOWARD</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Shoppers from Pasadena to Mission Viejo are finding new spots to
spend money on personal luxury: day spas where they can treat
themselves to pleasures that range from a simple steam bath to a full
day of rubdowns and relaxation.</LD>
<LD>   Day spas have been proliferating during the last few years at
resorts and hotels, but they're a relatively recent phenomenon at
shopping centers.</LD>
<LD>   Their operators hope that shopping and massaging will mix, thanks
to the rising popularity of spas in general and landlords' perpetual
quest for attractive tenants.</LD>
<TE>   Spas are designed to soothe the senses with trickling waterfalls,
the scents of fresh flowers and lotions, muted music, soft lighting
and earth-tone decors.</TE>
<TE>   The Glen Ivy day spa slated to open this year at the Brea Mall
will feature a garden setting surrounded by 14 massage rooms, five
suites for facial treatments, men's and women's locker rooms, two
Roman baths, two steam rooms, and eight manicure and pedicure
stations. It also will sell bath salts and body oils, skin cleansers
and toners, shampoos and conditioners, moisturizing creams and Glen
Ivy bath robes.</TE>
<TE>   The Brea location will be the first venture into a shopping center
for 129-year-old Glen Ivy, which will join a growing list of Southern
California shopping center spas offering the same pampering and
relaxation that have made spas so popular at resorts and hotels.</TE>
<TE>   Among those already operating at shopping centers are
Pasadena-based Amadeus Spa &amp; Salon and Santa Monica-based Burke
Williams. More shopping center spas are in the works. Amadeus will
have one at the Grove, the new shopping center going up at the
Farmers Market in Los Angeles, and spa operators are looking for
other retail locations.</TE>
<TE>   "Day spas have a much broader appeal today than they had even 10
years ago," said leasing vice president Michael Means of Santa
Monica-based Douglas Emmett &amp; Co., owner of the Sherman Oaks
Galleria, where Burke Williams recently opened a spa.</TE>
<TE>   Day spas have caught on because they are convenient, according to
John Gray, chief executive of Glen Ivy Hot Springs.</TE>
<TE>   "There are lots of people who don't have the time or money to go
away to a resort or a destination spa for a week and spend a couple
of thousand dollars," he said, "but they can afford a visit to a day
spa.''</TE>
<TE>   Glen Ivy is venturing into Brea Mall to get closer to a lot more
potential customers, said Gray, who pointed out that the mall's 16
million shopper visits per year far exceed the number of people who
happen by Glen Ivy's entrance on a country road in Corona.</TE>
<TE>   Shopping center spas are an outgrowth of the success of such
operations at hotels and health clubs, said Bill Wilhelm, a vice
president at Irvine-based R. D. Olson Construction, which has built
half a dozen day spas at Southland hotels in the last few years and
is the contractor for Glen Ivy's Brea location.</TE>
<TE>   Hotel day spas draw many of their customers from the surrounding
community, Wilhelm said, so it stands to reason that people will
visit a shopping center spa that's nearby. Among the newest spas to
open in retail centers are Burke Williams at the Sherman Oaks
Galleria and Amadeus at Paseo Colorado in Pasadena.</TE>
<TE>   "The notion of a day spa fit very well for the mix we wanted to
create," said Means, who said Emmett's goal in redeveloping the
Galleria was to create a "lifestyle business center" combining
offices and shopping with restaurants, movie theaters and leisure
activities.</TE>
<TE>   The Grove at the Farmer's Market will be the seventh location for
Amadeus, said President Joe Wong, who founded the company in 1987.
Spas can work well in malls, he said, provided the spa operator can
negotiate an affordable rent--an important consideration because
profit margins are thinner than those of typical retail businesses.</TE>
<TE>   "Our labor costs are relatively high because we provide personal
services," Wong said. "You can only generate so much revenue from a
steam room or a massage room."</TE>
<TE>   Selling such items as robes, slippers and skin care products can
be more profitable than the service side of the business, so most spa
owners now operate retail counters in their establishments. Retail
sales account for about 20% of Amadeus' business, said Wong, who
hopes to boost that percentage.</TE>
<TE>   Spas also have a harder time making a profit because the cost of
outfitting them is much higher than the cost of building ordinary
retail store space. Generic retail stores cost about $20 to $30 per
square foot to build, according to Wilhelm of Olson Construction, but
spas can cost $100 to $200 more per square foot. At the Brea Mall,
Glen Ivy is spending about $1.5 million to outfit its
14,000-square-foot spa.</TE>
<TE>   The extra costs, Wilhelm said, are for the specialized and more
extensive plumbing lines, showers, sinks, tubs, expensive piping and
fixtures in steam and sauna rooms, more-elaborate heating and air
conditioning systems, larger electrical power supplies, and other
extras such as marble entries.</TE>
<TE>   If the Brea shopping center location succeeds, Gray said, Glen Ivy
will consider expanding to other shopping centers in California and
other states. Spas will face much competition for consumers'
discretionary dollars, he said, but they're also one of the few ways
people can splurge on a treat that doesn't involve calories.</TE>

<DH>Developers say interest in new projects has picked up as
cinema operators emerge from bankruptcy.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JESUS SANCHEZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>After struggling to find uses for thousands of closed movie theaters,
property owners say there are signs that newly reorganized theater
operators once again are building cinemas--albeit on a selective
basis.</LD>
<LD>   "The majority of the closures are over," said Chris Wilson,
president of Los Angeles-based Wilson Commercial Real Estate, which
represents retail landlords. "The theater business is nearly healed."</LD>
<LD>   Los Angeles developer Jerry Snyder said three chains have
expressed strong interest in opening a 20-screen movie theater at
Huntington Beach Mall, most of which is being torn down by his firm
to make way for a new open-air shopping center</LD>
<TE>   "They desperately want to be in my Huntington Beach property,"
Snyder said. "AMC just called and said they want to be in there."</TE>
<TE>   Only a few months ago, Snyder couldn't persuade a theater operator
to build a cinema at his Rancho Mirage shopping center, which opened
in December. He ended up building the theater himself and contracting
with a chain to operate the 12-screen complex.</TE>
<TE>   Renewed interest in theater development is good news for property
owners who got stuck with empty buildings after many of the top
chains--including Edwards Theatres Circuit Inc., Regal Cinemas Inc.
and General Cinemas Theaters Inc.--filed for bankruptcy protection
and closed thousands of poorly performing and obsolete theaters.</TE>
<TE>   The nationwide number of movie screens, which had ballooned from
about 27,000 to 38,000 during the 1990s, now is about 36,000 and
continues to drop, industry observers say.</TE>
<TE>   The chains' retrenchment also foiled the plans of developers who
had counted on movie theaters to draw customer traffic to their
projects. In Long Beach, Developers Diversified Realty Corp. put much
of its $100-million Queensway Bay project on hold after two
operators, Edwards Theatres and later Resort Theaters of America
Inc., filed for bankruptcy protection. The firm found a third
operator, Crown Theaters, to commit to opening the 15-screen cinema.</TE>
<TE>   Old theaters may continue to go dark but developers say interest
in new projects has picked up in recent months as operators emerge
from bankruptcy with the help of new investors.</TE>
<TE>   Late last month, for example, Knoxville, Tenn.-based Regal Cinemas
emerged from Bankruptcy Court as part of a larger company that also
includes the United Artists and Edwards chains. The three chains were
purchased by Denver billionaire Philip Anschutz, who has emerged as a
major player in the theater business.</TE>
<TE>   But developers and property owners should not expect a theater
building boom soon, industry analysts say. For one thing, much of the
new construction is to replace smaller, obsolete theaters that were
closed. In addition, the new projects are expected to rise in the few
densely populated neighborhoods that lack a theater or are served by
smaller facilities.</TE>
<TE>   "There are some pockets of the country where there is potentially
demand for new screens," said industry analyst David H. Allen at
Morgan Stanley Dean Witter. But the pace of building will pale in
comparison to what was seen in the 1990s, he said.</TE>
<TE>   The slower pace of development and additional theater closures
mean that property owners will continue to struggle to find new
tenants or uses for their darkened cinemas. In many cases, the older
theaters will need costly renovations and expansions to include many
of the features--such as stadium-seating and cafes--found in
successful new multiplexes, real estate broker Wilson said.</TE>
<TE>   With little hope of finding a new theater operator, a former
United Artists cinema in Granada Hills is being converted to a Stein
Mart apparel store.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the owners of a former Edwards theater in Simi Valley
will demolish the 80,000-square-foot structure to build a new retail
complex, Wilson said. Theater chains "are only looking at strong,
urban mixed-use projects with all of the right components," he said.</TE>

<HD>Todai Hopes to Expand Chain</HD>
<DH>Restaurants: The company, which has 17 buffets, has tapped
into consumers' appetite for all-you-can-eat sushi.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARC BALLON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Eddie Ortega, plate in hand, was approaching Todai's 160-foot-long
buffet table when a fellow diner cut in front to grab a California
roll, stomping on his foot along the way. Moments later, another
customer plowed into Ortega as he was filling his plate with tuna
sushi, knocking him off balance.</LD>
<LD>   "Eating here's almost like driving on an L.A. freeway," said the
32-year-old bill collector, who has become a regular at Todai
restaurant in Orange. "It's a full-contact sport."</LD>
<LD>   Customers such as Ortega don't seem to mind the jostling that goes
on during dinnertime at Todai--a growing chain of 17 buffets with
ambitious expansion plans. Last year, Los Angeles-based Todai
Franchising opened three new restaurants, which helped propel annual
sales of its company-owned and franchised outlets to $70 million, the
company said.</LD>
<TE>   Despite a big falloff in business after Sept. 11, struggling
outlets in Texas and the failure of a franchised restaurant last year
at the Beverly Center in Los Angeles, the company is hoping to tap
into American consumers' increasing appetite for buffets--especially
those serving ethnic foods. Hans Kim, a former engineer who is
Todai's chief executive, wants to open seven more Todai buffets this
year.</TE>
<TE>   "I'd like Todai to be a recognized brand name, like maybe the
McDonald's of the buffet business," Kim said.</TE>
<TE>   Todai operates in five Western states, with most of its 17
restaurants in California. About half are franchised, the remainder
company-owned.</TE>
<TE>   Buffets in general are attracting customers as never before,
having upgraded their menus in an effort to shed a reputation for
mediocre food, said Tim Carlin of Technomic Inc., a restaurant
research and consulting firm near Chicago.</TE>
<TE>   Sales at the nation's all-you-can-eat chains jumped about 7% last
year to about $3 billion, outpacing the industry's 3.5% increase, as
value-conscious diners increasingly deserted high-end restaurants in
favor of eateries offering lower prices.</TE>
<TE>   Todai, which has been around for 17 years, isn't like most  buffet
restaurants. For one, it's hardly cheap: Adults pay $12 to $14 for
lunch, and $22 to $26 for dinner, depending on the location.</TE>
<TE>   With a menu dominated by sushi--40 varieties--Todai also is
banking on a dish that is considered a delicacy, a strategy that may
limit the chain's expansion options, industry experts say.</TE>
<TE>   "Can you imagine putting one of them in Kansas City?" Carlsbad
restaurant consultant Hal Sieling asked.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, two company-owned Texas outlets--in unpopular malls in the
Houston and Dallas areas--have failed to draw big crowds, prompting
Todai to boost its advertising budget by 25% there.</TE>
<TE>   The company shuttered a franchised buffet last year in the Beverly
Center after a string of losses and missed royalty payments. Todai
executives say the quality of food and service had deteriorated.</TE>
<TE>   Todai plans to open a company-owned restaurant at the same
location in March, controller Andrew Chung said. The experience has
reinforced the firm's decision to open only company-owned buffets in
the future to exert more control.</TE>
<TE>   Generally, the company's strategy is to operate in upscale areas
with a sizable concentration of Asian Americans, General Manager Paul
Lee said. Todai operates buffets in Cerritos and Arcadia, for
example, and is planning to open restaurants this year in Daly City,
Calif., Seattle and buffet mecca Las Vegas.</TE>
<TE>   The chain plans to finance each new $2-million unit through cash
flow and bank loans, but hopes to sell stock to the public within
three years to fund future expansion, Chung said. If all goes as
planned, the 1,400-employee chain will open as many as 30 restaurants
in the next five years.</TE>
<TE>   Japanese brothers Kaku and Toru Makino opened the first Todai in
Santa Monica in 1985. The restaurant, one of the first
all-you-can-eat sushi places, struck a chord with the public. Long
lines often snaked around the corner. By the late 1990s, the brothers
had opened 10 buffets in California.</TE>
<TE>   One of Todai's most enthusiastic customers was Hans Kim, a Korean
engineer who dined at the Santa Monica outlet whenever he came to
Southern California on business.</TE>
<TE>   In 1988, Kim moved to the U.S. and soon founded a computer repair
business. His wife, Un H. Kim, owned three thriving Teriyaki Tokyo
fast food restaurants in Los Angeles. Itching to branch out, the Kims
acquired a Todai restaurant in Studio City in 1995 for an undisclosed
sum.</TE>
<TE>   He assembled a group of Korean friends, family members and
business associates to form an investment group, Meramia, that
purchased a majority stake in the Todai chain in 1998. By that time,
the Makinos had sold three restaurants. One, in Huntington Beach,
still operates independently under the Todai name.</TE>
<TE>   Kim and the new owners upgraded the menu, adding such items as
Canadian lobster and crab. But the strategy has carried a hefty
price.</TE>
<TE>   Even though Todai buys in bulk and gets discounts, food costs
consume 39% of the chain's sales, compared with about a third of
sales at other buffets. Every day, for example, Todai chefs cut up
nearly 2,000 pounds of tuna and salmon for sushi. To minimize waste,
restaurants scale back the amount of food offered near closing time.</TE>
<TE>   Still, trays of sushi, salads and other items are thrown out
daily, said Lee, Todai's general manager and one of the Meramia
investors. It's "one of the costs of doing business," he added.</TE>
<TE>   The chain doesn't make any pretensions about matching the tasty
morsels offered at swanky sushi spots such as the three Sushi Roku
restaurants, where the average check runs $45. But Todai restaurants,
adorned with decorative goldfish and sea horses, appeal to diners who
prize quantity as well as quality, said Janet Lowder, president of
Restaurant Management Services in Rancho Palos Verdes.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the slump after Sept. 11, the chain maintained a profit
margin of 5% at year's end, controller Chung said, exceeding the
restaurant industry  average of 3% to 4%.</TE>
<TE>   Ultimately, the 51-year-old Kim hopes to blanket the East and West
coasts with Todais.</TE>
<TE>   "We're like a snowball," he said. "We started off slowly, but
we're going faster, faster and faster."</TE>

<HD>Mechanics, United Reach Tentative Deal</HD>
<DH>Aviation: The contract comes two days before a threatened
strike would have crippled the airline and badly disrupted air travel
in the U.S.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAMES F. PELTZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>United Airlines and its mechanics union reached a tentative contract
Monday only two days before a threatened strike would have crippled
United and badly disrupted U.S. air travel.</LD>
<LD>   United, a unit of UAL Corp., and the International Assn. of
Machinists said the 10,600 mechanics and 2,200 utility workers
covered by the negotiations would vote March 5 on the pact, with "no
disruption to service for United customers."</LD>
<LD>   Specific details of the five-year accord weren't immediately
available. But the IAM said it "includes improvements" over a
contract proposed by an emergency board established by President Bush
in December.</LD>
<TE>   That proposal called for the mechanics--who haven't had a pay
raise since 1994--to get an immediate 37% wage increase, among other
gains. That would have raised senior mechanics' wages to $35.14 an
hour, the top mechanics' pay in the industry.</TE>
<TE>   But the mechanics rejected that deal because of objections to
deferring retroactive pay they're due (their last contract
technically ended July 2000) and to making unspecified wage
concessions United is seeking from all its employees to survive.</TE>
<TE>   In the new pact, the union said the retroactive pay issue is
"enhanced" and that it won the right to let its members vote on
whatever recovery plan United and UAL develop to stem the big
airline's massive losses.</TE>
<TE>   "This agreement fulfills the IAM's promise to negotiate an
industry-leading contract," said Scotty Ford, the IAM's lead
negotiator with United. UAL Chief Executive Jack Creighton said the
tentative deal "is a critical milestone in developing a recovery
plan" for United and UAL, which lost $2.1 billion last year, an
industry record.</TE>
<TE>   A strike would have wreaked havoc for United, which is 55% owned
by the mechanics and other employees. The airline, battling a travel
slump caused by the weak U.S. economy and the Sept. 11 attacks, is
losing about $10 million a day. The mechanics' dispute, and fears
about United's grounding, were prompting a growing number of
travelers to make reservations with other carriers.</TE>
<TE>   The tentative deal "had to happen or this airline was going to be
destroyed," said Terry Trippler, an industry consultant. "They have
suffered a lot already."</TE>
<TE>   Bush established the emergency board to head off the mechanics'
original plan to strike Dec. 20. After the board's deal was rejected
Feb. 12, the workers were again free to strike Wednesday unless they
could come to terms. Only Congress could have stopped the walkout
with emergency legislation, but it's in recess until Feb. 26.</TE>
<TE>   The White House had no comment Monday; Bush is in Asia.</TE>
<TE>   The IAM had warned Congress to stay out of the dispute, saying the
two sides could reach a deal themselves. The agreement came with
little time to spare; over the weekend mechanics began removing their
tool boxes and personal belongings from United maintenance centers in
preparation for a strike.</TE>
<TE>   One of the airline's largest such centers is in San Francisco,
which, with Los Angeles, is among the major hubs for United, the
nation's second-largest airline behind AMR Corp.'s American Airlines.
United operates about 1,650 flights a day worldwide, and it's the
biggest operator at Los Angeles International Airport.</TE>
<TE>   Even if the mechanics ratify the new contract, United remains
troubled. The carrier has one of the highest cost structures in the
business, and must wrestle concessions from its entire work force if
it hopes to endure the travel slump and return to profitability,
analysts have said.</TE>
<TE>   The mechanics had said they wouldn't accept any concessions until
they won an increase in their industry-lagging wages. Yet if the
mechanics win the right to vote on future concessions, other unions
might want to negotiate the same privilege. United's pilots won a
lucrative new contract in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   United, like several other big airlines, also must find ways to
lure more business travelers, who typically pay higher fares than
leisure passengers and thus account for most of the carrier's income.</TE>
<TE>   Financial markets were closed Monday for Presidents Day. UAL's
stock closed Friday at $11.36 on the New York Stock Exchange.</TE>

<HD>The Secret to Talking to North Korea Is to Whisper, Not
Shout</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JONG KEUN YOU</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It is widely believed that Pyongyang is stocking chemical and
biological weapons of mass destruction, developing long-range
ballistic missiles and selling destabilizing weapons to countries
such as Iran, Syria, Libya, Egypt and Pakistan. The answer to this
real or imagined threat from North Korea, however, does not rest in
belligerent words from Washington.</LD>
<LD>   Hard-line pressure from the U.S.--such as President Bush's "axis
of evil" characterization--only pushes North Korea away from the
bargaining table because the North abhors losing face. An excessive
polemic also alienates many South Koreans, who feel the U.S. is
taking unilateral steps on a matter of utmost importance to them.</LD>
<LD>   The answer to the North's threat also does not lie in conventional
diplomatic channels among the countries on and around the Korean
peninsula.</LD>
<TE>   What is needed to reach any solution is a cover of secrecy.</TE>
<TE>   President Bush and South Korean President Kim Dae Jung, during
their summit in Seoul, must go beyond tough talk and diplomacy to
explore initiating immediate, closed-door discussions with North
Korea to achieve the following objectives:</TE>
<TE>   It must be determined whether Pyongyang is willing to deliver
verifiable concessions in its weapons development and deployment
effort; whether it will allow the International Atomic Energy Agency
to inspect suspected nuclear facilities and if a three-way summit of
the North, the South and the U.S. is possible before year's end to
seal these concessions in exchange for U.S. diplomatic recognition
and economic cooperation.</TE>
<TE>   Through these secret negotiations, Kim Jong Il should be made
aware that Washington views Pyongyang's development and export of
weapons of mass destruction as a clear danger to U.S. security,
particularly after Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   There is a reasonable chance that Kim Jong Il will accept these
realities--an agreement between Pyongyang and Washington was very
nearly concluded during the Clinton administration's last months. It
was only Kim Jong Il's hesitation that allowed the clock to run out.</TE>
<TE>   Kim Jong Il also was reluctant to visit Seoul after Kim Dae Jung's
trip to Pyongyang in 2000. By not doing so, the North Korean leader
has missed an opportunity to maximize economic and diplomatic gains
for the North.</TE>
<TE>   Such a visit at the moment presents big risks to Kim Jong Il
because South Korea's presidential campaign has begun in earnest. A
North-South meeting now would result in an intense debate similar to
the kind that created political problems not just for Kim Dae Jung
but also for Kim Jong Il.</TE>
<TE>   If there is a lesson for the North Korean leader, it is that
procrastination must be avoided.</TE>
<TE>   Under these circumstances, the solution to the North Korean
situation requires a bold approach, such as a three-way summit
meeting that can only be initiated under the cover of quiet
diplomacy.</TE>
<TE>   Reason should prevail over rhetoric.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The common thread among all the states that prohibit or impede
adoption by gays and lesbians is their stated desire to provide the
best possible homes for children.</LD>
<LD>   It is not homophobia, they assert, to enact laws and policies
acknowledging the benefits of parenting by both a mother and a father
who are married to each other. They invariably add--during
legislative or courtroom debates if not in statutory language--that
preventing homosexuals from adopting effectively protects children
from being negatively influenced or even physically harmed by the
adults who are supposed to protect them.</LD>
<LD>   All those arguments are ill-informed and disingenuous nonsense.</LD>
<TE>   If politicians and judges in these states truly believed their own
words, they would act immediately to remove millions of supposedly
at-risk children from families in which one or both parents are gay.
More urgently, they would be using the legal system to attack the
scourge of single parenthood--which deprives far more kids of two
married, cohabitating, heterosexual parents than any other cultural
phenomenon in history.</TE>
<TE>   A serious effort to achieve either of those goals won't be mounted
anywhere, of course, though some social conservatives probably would
like to see it happen. But it won't for two principal reasons:
Whatever their personal or political views, policymakers generally
understand that there's little they can do to alter the reality that
diverse families of all sorts are becoming commonplace in our
country; and, more pointedly, there is no credible evidence that
children raised in nontraditional families suffer from a lack of
love, stability or safety.</TE>
<TE>   Both those points were underscored in a big way earlier this month
when the American Academy of Pediatrics announced its backing for
gays and lesbians in so-called second-parent adoptions, the mechanism
by which one partner becomes a second legal parent to the other's
biological or adopted children. Such adoptions have taken place in
about two dozen states, although only seven and the District of
Columbia explicitly permit the procedure. A few prohibit it or make
it bureaucratically impossible; and one, New Jersey, allows
homosexuals to adopt as couples at the same time.</TE>
<TE>   The academy's support for second-parent adoptions is important not
only because it puts the imprimatur of a highly regarded, mainstream
organization on a controversial practice but also because an academy
committee reviewed 20 years of research and concluded that children
raised by homosexuals are just as well-adjusted as their counterparts
reared by heterosexuals.</TE>
<TE>   This is obviously good news for gay-rights proponents, as well as
for advocates of nontraditional families. It would be a huge mistake,
however, for policymakers to interpret the academy's findings too
narrowly: The findings also should broaden the pool of perspective
parents for the tens of thousands of children who live in foster
care. There isn't a state that has enough applicants to give these
kids homes, yet too many still prevent gays and lesbians from
adopting.</TE>
<TE>   It always has been tough to figure how anyone could conclude that
a child was better off in his or her fifth foster home than in a
loving, albeit untraditional family. Now, in light of the academy's
findings, it's going to get even harder to view such policies as
anything other than overtly homophobic.</TE>
<TE>   The situation in Florida, the only state to ban all gay and
lesbian adoptions outright, shows how silly and counterproductive the
debate has been. In affirming a state law forbidding adoption by
homosexuals last year, a federal court in Florida said that the three
HIV-infected children being raised by a gay man (who had been named
Foster Father of the Year) would be better off in a home with two
married, heterosexual parents.</TE>
<TE>   Never mind that children like these, with serious special needs,
are languishing in every state without parents of any type. And never
mind the convoluted logic that leads Florida to allow gays and
lesbians to serve as foster parents but not to adopt the children
they are raising anyway.</TE>
<TE>   I just hope politicians and policymakers do keep this in mind as
they consider the implications of the academy's findings: As a result
of changes in federal laws, Americans can adopt in any state, not
just the one in which they live. So the states that try to prevent or
restrict a gay or lesbian from becoming a parent cannot achieve their
aim; they can only prevent children in their custody from getting
permanent families.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>You have to hand it to George Bush the senior for hustle. Back in
1998, he took at least $80,000 in stock from Global Crossing in
return for speaking for the company in Tokyo. The payment was made as
the company was about to go public and the stock's value quickly
multiplied 175-fold to $14 million. Maybe some congressional
committee will turn up how much of that stock the former president
sold before the company went belly up a few weeks ago.</LD>
<LD>   But that score was nothing compared with the elder Bush's own
global crossings as a highly paid consultant to the Carlyle Group, a
$12-billion equity investment firm heavy into the defense and energy
games. Carlyle's chairman, Frank Carlucci, who was Reagan's Defense
secretary, is a close friend of the current secretary, Donald
Rumsfeld, his Princeton wrestling partner. The Carlyle company roster
also includes top vets of the first Bush administration, led by
ex-Secretary of State James Baker--a political gunslinger who worked
hard on George W. Bush's postelection campaign to secure Florida's
electoral votes and the White House.</LD>
<TE>   In fact, the government alums in the Carlyle Group are so well
connected internationally that, until Sept. 11, the group was even
trusted to invest the funds of the Bin Laden family--although not
those controlled by the family black sheep, who is charged with
slaughtering several thousand innocents using Saudi recruits and
money. The elder Bush himself is well connected with the Saudis,
having fought the Gulf War to save the royal kingdom from being
gobbled up by wicked Saddam Hussein.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, after George W. assumed the presidency, grateful Saudis
welcomed his Poppy and his colleagues from the Carlyle Group who were
in town to sign new contracts based on oil wealth. Hey, fair is fair:
Bush the senior had saved the sheiks' bacon and now they give him a
slice.</TE>
<TE>   Most former presidents putter around their presidential libraries,
getting in a game of golf or two while they shuffle papers for their
memoirs. Then there's Jimmy Carter, trying to atone for sins he
didn't commit in office by becoming a carpenter for the poor, and
poor Bill Clinton who still has to prove to right-wing talk show nuts
and their spokespersons in Congress that his wife didn't steal the
White House silverware.</TE>
<TE>   Nothing like that for George, who has returned to the spirit of
his early days, when he used the connections of his family name to
strike it rich in the Texas oil fields. This time, the big prize lies
in the defense budget. With his son the president defending the
biggest military buildup since the darkest days of the Cold War by
pointing to the grim work of Saudi-sponsored terrorists, no weapons
system is too gaudy or implausible to be embraced with bipartisan
fervor.</TE>
<TE>   That's fortunate for the buddies of the president's father over at
Carlyle, who have invested heavily in military equipment without
military purpose.</TE>
<TE>   Take the 80,000-ton Crusader howitzer cannon designed to defeat
the tanks of the Soviet army in a conventional war in Central Europe.
As a candidate, even George W. Bush made fun of the antiquated weapon
as he campaigned on the principle of a leaner, more efficient
military built for modern wars.</TE>
<TE>   But perhaps nobody had told him that the Crusader is being built
by a defense contractor called United Defense, owned by the Carlyle
Group. Clinton, on the advice of the Pentagon, was set to bury the
weapon as a Cold War artifact. Now Bush the younger has embraced
it--and Carlyle suddenly found the confidence to take United Defense
public after holding off for a decade.</TE>
<TE>   No biggie. What's $11 billion for the Crusader in a defense budget
designed to grow to $451 billion by 2007? Only a bleeding heart pinko
pacifist would point out that $11 billion is what this "education"
president is planning to spend on educating the nation's poor
children under next year's Title I appropriation. But hey, child
poverty is not the Carlyle Group's business.</TE>

that President George H.W. Bush visited Saudi Arabia on behalf of the
Carlyle Group after his son became president. Bush's visit was prior to
his son's presidential inauguration. Also, the Carlyle Group bought
United Defense in 1997, not 10 years ago.</CX>

<LD>Re "Liberal Media Ignore What They Don't Want to Hear," Commentary,
Feb. 14: As the country reels from the Enron scandal--grand
theft--and waits for the other shoe to drop from the ill-conceived,
albeit successful, effects of Enron's lobbying to influence George W.
Bush and Dick Cheney on energy policy, Norah Vincent has the audacity
to suggest that "special interest bureaucrats," which she defines as
flacks, are "almost exclusively the property of the complainant
left."</LD>
<LD>   Would that be the oil industry flacks? The arms industry flacks?
The drug industry flacks? The agricultural industry flacks? The auto
industry flacks? No, she's concerned about those who work for human
rights. These people, without billions of dollars and an open
invitation to the White House and Wall Street, apparently have too
much power.</LD>
<LD>   And who's to blame? She blames the corporate media, which
published the very books she cites for her so-called evidence. This
upside-down, inside-out logic qualifies her to run Enron, but as
columnists go, in an otherwise thoughtful newspaper, it raises the
question: What planet did you get her from, and when will you send
her back?</LD>

<TE>   I welcome the insights of Tammy Bruce in her new book, "The New
Thought Police: Inside the Left's Assault on Free Speech and Free
Minds," outlining the undemocratic actions of various leftist
organizations. However, I would suggest that Vincent take some time
out to learn some manners; blistering diatribe is not necessarily
persuasive commentary, especially coming from a member of a "think"
tank.</TE>
<TE>   Vincent came off sounding like a vein-popping AM radio talk-show
host, not as someone interested in furthering the public discourse on
efforts to quell terrorism. Ironically, I first heard about this book
on National Public Radio, not exactly a conservative media source.</TE>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I am still in shock over Vincent's commentary on the liberal
media. As a frequent critic of her editorial ramblings--especially
the one on Feb. 7 on why we are hated--I now willingly give her some
kudos. She not only has awakened to a situation that has been in
existence for decades but she also gives a little boost to Bruce's
expose book on the liberals' attack on free speech and free thought
and to Bernard Goldberg's book on media bias ("Bias: A CBS Insider
Exposes How the Media Distort the News"), both of which are must
reading.</TE>

<LD>"Airport Panel Revisits Plans for Palmdale" (Feb. 13) is yet another
example of L.A.'s complete disregard for the facts behind responsible
airport planning. The city of Los Angeles has deliberately avoided
talking about the Burbank and Long Beach airports, the most likely
airports to feel an impact should capacity be restricted at LAX. Why?
Because, unlike Palmdale Airport, Los Angeles neither owns nor
controls the Burbank or Long Beach airports.</LD>
<LD>   While Palmdale civic leaders clearly want air transportation
services, the fact is they can't support even a few commuter flights
per week. The truth is that neither L.A. nor Palmdale can make the
airlines invest in an unproven airport. Long Beach and Burbank are
closer to the population centers that demand air service. While
Burbank's terminal poses challenges--as does its intransigent City
Council--Long Beach has more than ample capacity and is actively
seeking airlines.</LD>
<LD>   If L.A. really wants a practical solution to LAX expansion it
needs to look closer to home and stop looking to the high desert for
a way out of its capacity problem.</LD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>While we slept, thieves in Washington illegally amended the U.S.
Constitution and stole a large piece of our liberties ("House OKs
Campaign Finance Bill," Feb. 14). In direct violation of the 1st
Amendment, a so-called campaign finance reform bill was passed which
will, in effect, put the politicians themselves in charge of the
political process and unfairly protect incumbents.</LD>
<LD>   Ordinary citizens have a large collective voice in politics by
donating small sums of money to organizations that can buy
advertising time. That right will be banned 60 days before an
election, but the editorialists, the candidates themselves and the
media will be under no restriction in their quest to influence public
opinion. If a candidate buys air time one week before an election and
lies in the ad, we will have no way to counter that with ads of our
own.</LD>
<LD>   Our only hope lies with the Supreme Court. Our Constitution was
written by brilliant men who limited government. The 1st Amendment
begins, "Congress shall make no law ... ," yet that is just what our
representatives did.</LD>
<TE>   John Lynch</TE>
<TE>   Studio City</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Those who call campaign finance reform an abridgment of
constitutional free speech have it backward. Had the founding fathers
known what one was, they would have perceived large, politically
active corporations or interest groups as the equivalent of dukes and
earls in the monarchical system that had just been expelled from our
shores.</TE>
<TE>   Their idea of free speech was that every man had a voice, an
unamplified voice, its reach unexaggerated by the accumulation of
power. Corporations and individuals who make huge contributions to
politicians effectively amplify their own voices and drown out the
rest of us. The fact is, it's the lack of campaign finance reform
that abridges the constitutional right of the individual to have his
or her voice heard.</TE>
<TE>   Jim Houghton</TE>
<TE>   Encino</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Our founding fathers wrote the Constitution with one person/one
vote in mind. They did not foresee that our government would become
"one vote for sale" to the highest bidder. Without true campaign
reform, not something that just sounds good but does nothing, our
government is a mockery of democracy. We the people, not we the
people with money, is the basis of the very heart of our country.
Please, change the dishonest mess our government has become.</TE>

<HD>Prop. 45 Would Dismantle Term Limits</HD>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Re "A 'No' Vote Could Bring Back Willie Brown," Feb. 13: Prop. 45 is
a scam to undermine and eventually dismantle term limits by
politicians and special interests. The proponents say that "term
limits have reinvigorated the political process by promoting full
participation and bringing a breath of fresh air to California
government," yet they propose a proposition that would undermine it.
To allow a legislator to be returned to office for four years more
than allowed by term limits, because his constituents like him, would
result in all legislators taking advantage of this option. The next
step would be another proposition to further dismantle term limits on
the basis of some other specious argument.</LD>
<LD>   The real motive of Prop. 45 can be found in the list of
politicians and special interest donors in support of the proposition
who would benefit by the dismantling of term limits. The donors
include the Democratic Party, Democratic politicians, organized
labor, regulated industries (financial, tobacco, alcohol, gambling,
insurance, energy, etc.) and trial lawyers. Prop. 45 is a scam and
should not be approved.</LD>

<LD>It's wonderful to hear that the entertainment industry is giving
animation "new respect" (Feb. 12). It has been 65 years since the
first animated feature was recognized by the motion picture academy
with an Oscar, but I guess critical respect takes time to build. It
would also be wonderful if the industry would recognize the writers
behind animated films and television programs with the same respect
for professionalism that is paid to the writers of live action.</LD>
<LD>   Animation writers would like the same protections and benefits
provided to live-action writers. The Writers Guild of America is
eager to provide it. But business affairs executives and studio heads
lag behind. They apparently don't have the same level of respect for
us as the rest of the industry.</LD>

<LD>Re "Watkins Depicts Fear at Enron," Feb. 15: On Valentine's Day,
Sherron Watkins became America's sweetheart. Enron had the
(so-called) best and brightest CPAs and attorneys. Watkins went
against the grain and stood up to those stuffed shirts. If there were
more Sherrons in the country, there would have been no Internet
bubble (which turned undeserving young insiders into overnight
millionaires) and the resulting downfall, with many hard-working
people and the retired losing their last penny.</LD>
<LD>   Watkins should be appointed to the chairmanship of the SEC. This
is the great thing about America: For every greedy, sleazy CEO there
is a Sherron Watkins.</LD>

<TE>   Hmm, let's see. If, as Watkins says, Ken (Lay) was bamboozled by
Jeff (Skilling) and Andy (Fastow), why did Ken take the 5th? Methinks
there was (and, for all we know, still is) something rotten in the
state of Enron (a.k.a. Texas). No wonder Dick's (Cheney) cave is
almost as hard to find as Osama's.</TE>

<TE>   Why are Skilling, Lay and the others in Enron who filled their
pockets with money pretending that they were not aware of the shady
dealings in their company? For the millions of dollars that they were
paid in salary and bonuses, it was their business to know and keep
track of what happened in the company. That's what they were being
paid for. If they truly did not know the goings-on, then I deem that
they were the most well-paid bunch of incompetent employees in
history.</TE>

<TE>   As Congress drags the officials of the Enron scandal before the TV
cameras, I can only turn away in shame and embarrassment. These
people are products of our own making.</TE>
<TE>   The modern corporation has become completely dysfunctional, and we
have made it so. It denies every mandate of modern life such as
sustainable growth, biodiversity, political development and social
equality. If it dares to honor the claims of the workers, the
environment or the community, we take it to court for bypassing an
opportunity for profit.</TE>
<TE>   We have made large corporations profoundly inhuman. Competition,
coercion and exploitation are essential aspects of their activities,
all motivated by the desire for unlimited expansion. We have insisted
that the market is value-free and should be allowed to operate
outside the realm of ethics and morality. The officials of Enron are
pawns in our own game. Our addiction to the market has made us all
moral midgets.</TE>

<TE>   The Enron executives should be allowed to make one final trade
before they are given any just penalty for the fraud they have
committed. Trade $1 million in cash for every one-year reduction in
jail sentence.</TE>

<LD>The U.S. government's conduct concerning Lotfi Raissi indicates that
it is convicting innocent people before proving them guilty
(Commentary, Feb. 14). Though this case took place in Britain,
hundreds of immigrants are being held in the U.S. indefinitely on
petty violations far less than a terrorism accusation. We as
Americans pride ourselves on living in a country where justice is
applied to all. Denying a person's day in court and the families' and
attorneys' right to know where and why he or she is being held is not
justice</LD>
<LD>   If Britain believes that the U.S. acted unjustly, it pains me to
think what the rest of the world thinks about our justice system. The
tragedy of Sept. 11 has taken our loved ones. Let it not also take
away our reputation of being the defender of justice and civil
rights.</LD>

<HD>'Traffic Talk' Translates Into Tie-Ups Avoided</HD>
<DH>Radio reporting on freeway conditions has a lingo all its
own. But does it drive home the message to motorists?</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LISA LEFF</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>There's a SigAlert stacking up traffic on the Four Level and a
jackknifed big rig putting a tight squeeze on the Orange Crush. The
El Toro Y, meanwhile, is feeling the pressure from some heavy-duty
police activity, while the Downtown Slot is filling up because of an
overturned roach coach in the No. 3 lane.</LD>
<LD>   You've listened to it. You've pondered it. You may have even
deciphered it. But as anyone with a car radio knows, Southland
traffic has a language all its own--an idiom heard, but not always
understood, by millions of commuters each day.</LD>
<LD>   Spoken by California Highway Patrol dispatchers, Caltrans
engineers and hurried traffic reporters, this ever-evolving patois of
slang, nicknames and numerology can sound like so much babble,
particularly to the untrained ear.</LD>
<TE>   "When people find out I'm a traffic reporter, the top two
questions they ask are: 'Do you fly in a helicopter?' and 'What's a
SigAlert?'" said Lisa Osborne, who became fluent in "traffic talk" as
a longtime traffic watcher for news station KFI-AM (640) and now
serves as president of Traffic411, a firm that provides traffic maps
for the Internet.</TE>
<TE>   "There are a lot of traffic reporters throwing out that term,"
said Osborne, "when most people don't really know what it means."</TE>
<TE>   We'll tackle that one shortly. In the meantime, rest assured that
the people who bring you bumper-to-bumper coverage are aware of your
confusion. Many radio traffic services say they are trying to reform
with the most lucid reports they can. But some shorthand is
inevitable when you're packing a region's worth of traffic into a
minute or less.</TE>
<TE>   AirTraffic Communications of Santa Ana--a private broadcasting
company that provides reports to 30 Southern California radio
stations--tries to discourage its reporters from using so-called
"CHP-isms." So managers of the company established a penalty system
two years ago: Every time AirWatch traffic staffers uttered obscure
terms they had to drop a quarter in a jar.</TE>
<TE>   Reporters had to give up "traffic hazard" in favor of a more vivid
description, say, "A pickup dropped a load of wooden pallets." Rather
than describe accidents in the "No. 2 lane," they were encouraged to
specify "the second lane from the left."</TE>
<TE>   "We have gotten to the point where we don't need the jar anymore
because we have trained people not to use the words," said director
of operations Don Bastida.</TE>
<TE>   To be sure, the level of attitude and jargon varies from station
to station.</TE>
<TE>   When AirWatch Traffic reporter Chris Hughes broadcasts for
pop-rock format STAR-FM (98.7), for instance, he might tell drivers:
"No breakfast burrito for you this morning because a roach coach is
stalled on the northbound 5." On an Orange County jazz station, the
same scene would be described as "a stalled catering truck tying up
traffic on the northbound 5."</TE>
<TE>   Many of the stations adopted a more serious approach a few years
back, after a USC study found that drivers can best retain traffic
reports when the information is presented in order, from the general
to the more specific, as in: "In Costa Mesa on the 405 North at
MacArthur there is an accident."</TE>
<TE>   That just-the-facts style reigns at many all-news stations today,
a striking departure from the playfully colloquial approach that
venerable KNX-AM (1070) traffic jockey Bill Keene brought to the
local airwaves.</TE>
<TE>   Keene, who retired in 1994 and died two years ago, tossed off
phrases such as "Poop-Out Hill" and "Malfunction Junction" to
describe traffic trouble spots. A motorist knocked off the road by a
minor accident had been "left caddywampus to the world," he liked to
say.</TE>
<TE>   A generation of traffic reporters picked up that tone, describing
car fires as "carbecues" and rear-end collisions as "bump and
crunches."</TE>
<TE>   "You don't hear that as much anymore, maybe because people
understand they have gone from cute to cliche," said Osborne of the
traffic mapping firm. "People, when they are sitting in traffic,
probably don't think it's as funny as the person sitting in the
studio does."</TE>
<TE>   Still, 45-second traffic reports require brevity, and many
nicknames for freeway locations have become part of the lexicon. For
instance: "Orange Crush" for the convergence of the Orange (57),
Garden Grove (22) and Santa Ana (5) freeways; "Cahuenga Pass" for the
Hollywood (101) Freeway between Barham Boulevard and Highland Avenue
in Hollywood; "Four Level" for the interchange of the Pasadena (110)
and the Hollywood (101) freeways in downtown Los Angeles; and "El
Toro Y" for the spot where the 405 and 5 freeways meet in Irvine.</TE>
<TE>   Other common freeway phraseology has no clear definition. It's
unclear, for instance, where the "Grapevine" actually begins and
ends, although most local drivers know it's the long mountain pass on
Interstate 5 that connects Los Angeles and the Central Valley.</TE>
<TE>   And even traffic reporters don't agree on what constitutes the
"Downtown Slot." Some say it's the section of the Harbor Freeway
between the Santa Monica and Hollywood freeways. Others say the slot
is a downtown Los Angeles stretch of Interstate 5, according to Chuck
Rowe, a radio reporter who maintains a glossary of traffic terms.</TE>
<TE>   In either case, the name was probably coined by an airborne
traffic reporter who noticed how the downtown buildings flanking the
freeway made it appear as if the flow of cars was passing through a
slot, Osborne said.</TE>
<TE>   To a large extent, the quick-witted KNX traffic anchor Jim
Thornton has inherited Bill Keene's mantel as the reigning
pun-meister among radio traffic reporters. He added "Bumper Thumper"
and "Four-Letter Interchange" to the lexicon--the latter a derisive
reference to the downtown Four Level.</TE>
<TE>   "We do have some fun in here. You have to. It would just drive you
crazy otherwise," said Thornton, who delivers 45 reports on a
five-hour shift.</TE>
<TE>   And what about the ubiquitous "SigAlert"? For the record, the CHP
defines it as an unscheduled lane closure lasting at least half an
hour.</TE>
<TE>   The familiar phrase, universally understood as meaning a bad
traffic tie-up, was created in the mid-1950s by LAPD Police Chief
William H. Parker as a tongue-in-cheek tribute to broadcast pioneer
Loyd C. Sigmon.</TE>
<TE>   Sigmon, in a bid to improve ratings on the radio station he
co-owned with Gene Autry, persuaded Parker to participate in an
experiment in which officers would alert the station over special
shortwave receivers whenever a freeway delay or other emergency was
developing.</TE>
<TE>   As local legend has it, the reticent police chief supposedly
quipped, "We're going to name this damn thing 'SigAlert.'"</TE>
<TE>   And the expression got stuck, just like all the baffled commuters.</TE>

<HD>Riordan Vows to Shun Lobby Groups; Jones Unveils Ad</HD>
<DH>Election: Former mayor again attacks Davis on fund-raising
as a rival has his first TV spot, featuring Deukmejian.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MICHAEL FINNEGAN and NICHOLAS RICCARDI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Pressing his case against Gov. Gray Davis, former Los Angeles Mayor
Richard Riordan promised Monday that if he is elected governor, he
will not let lobbyists meet with him or his staff.</LD>
<LD>   Under attack from his two rivals for the Republican nomination,
Riordan used a stop at Jerry's Famous Deli in Studio City to try to
keep the focus on the incumbent, Democrat Davis, whose prodigious
fund-raising he has repeatedly criticized.</LD>
<LD>   "Nobody is going to buy Dick Riordan or buy the state off through
Dick Riordan," said the former mayor, who added that he generally
does not accept contributions from lobbyists.</LD>
<TE>   The comments came as one of Riordan's major rivals prepared to go
on the air with an ad questioning Riordan's Republican credentials.</TE>
<TE>   Secretary of State Bill Jones unveiled a 30-second spot in which
former Gov. George Deukmejian calls Riordan a "liberal big city mayor
who has given millions of dollars to Democrats" and "a man I couldn't
vote for."</TE>
<TE>   Deukmejian, the chairman of Jones' campaign, also dismisses the
third candidate for the GOP nomination, Pacific Palisades businessman
Bill Simon Jr., as someone who has never been elected to public
office and never voted in a Republican primary. (Simon has
acknowledged failing to vote in three statewide primaries and his
staff challenges the accuracy of the Los Angeles County records that
show he missed others.)</TE>
<TE>   The former governor remains popular with the Republican
rank-and-file, and his public criticism of two men who hope to be the
party's nominee underscores how the three-man race has fractured the
GOP.</TE>
<TE>   Typically, retired statesmen decline to engage in pre-primary
negativity. But Deukmejian's and Riordan's squabble reaches back two
decades, to Riordan's loan of $300,000 to Los Angeles Mayor Tom
Bradley when he was running for governor against Deukmejian.</TE>
<TE>   Riordan, more moderate than Simon or Jones, has led in both
fund-raising and early polls, but according to private polls his lead
has been slipping. He has come under attack by his rivals for his
past support of Democrats, and from Davis for alleged inconsistencies
in his positions on abortion and the death penalty.</TE>
<TE>   Simon, a friend of Riordan's, shied away from attacks early in the
race but is expected to soon unleash his own ad going after the
former mayor.</TE>
<TE>   Jones ranks last in fund-raising among the major candidates, and
until today has not had a presence on the air. Aides said Jones' new
ad will run statewide beginning today. Those with knowledge of the
candidates' media purchases, however, said that as of Monday, Jones
had not bought any sizable time on television.</TE>
<TE>   The Jones ad not only attacks his two rivals but also tries to
introduce Jones to the electorate, all within 30 seconds. Deukmejian
calls the secretary of state "a leader we can trust." And, standing
next to the former governor, the candidate declares: "I offer what my
opponents can't: experience--and Republican values."</TE>
<TE>   At a campaign stop at the Reagan library in Simi Valley, Simon
scoffed at the ad's criticism of him. "I'm not going to make an issue
out of the fact that my opponents are professional politicians," said
Simon, who regularly underscores that very fact.</TE>
<TE>   Riordan used his pledge to spurn lobbyists as a way to step up his
attack on Davis and his ethics. Riordan also returned Monday to his
efforts last week to slam Davis for accepting campaign donations
around the same time he is deciding whether to sign or veto bills. He
vowed to end the practice.</TE>
<TE>   "That's all Gray Davis has in his mind: 'Before I sign a bill, how
much money can I wring out of people who have an interest in that
piece of legislation,' " Riordan said Monday.</TE>
<TE>   On the lobbying front, Riordan said he wanted his staff "to
independently make up their mind as to what's in the best interests
of the state, not what's in the best interest of Dick Riordan as a
politician--and not how much money I can get out of the person--as
Gray Davis does."</TE>
<TE>   Davis spokesman Roger Salazar accused Riordan of "making things
up....Gov. Davis' policy decisions are based on what's in the best
interests of the citizens of the state of California--and nothing
else."</TE>
<TE>   "Given Dick Riordan's record so far in this campaign of
distortions, exaggerations and half-truths," Salazar said, "I'm not
sure you can believe any promises he makes."</TE>
<TE>   Riordan said that when he was mayor, he generally did not allow
lobbyists into his office.</TE>
<TE>   "Now I can't say that any one of them didn't talk to one member of
my staff, because I don't know," he said. "The general rule was, they
gave up and spent their time lobbying the City Council."</TE>
<TE>   There are plenty of lobbyists at City Hall, but the profession is
far more ensconced in Sacramento, where $344 million was spent on
lobbying during 1999 and 2000, according to the secretary of state's
office. Lobbyists in the state capital work for groups ranging from
the Sierra Club to teacher and police unions to such corporate giants
as Chevron and Cisco.</TE>
<TE>   Riordan downplayed the need for lobbyists.</TE>
<TE>   "You've got all kinds of really outstanding groups throughout the
state and the country, so why do you need the lobbyists?" he said.
"Because the one thing is you know they're going to spin it towards
their client."</TE>
<TE>   Riordan, a multimillionaire, said his "general policy" has
been--and will continue to be--not to accept any donations from
lobbyists.</TE>
<TE>   "My policy always has been not to," he said. "But you're always
afraid that you're going to find one exception, and it's going to be
on the headlines."</TE>
<TE>   A preliminary review of the more than $9 million Riordan has
raised for his gubernatorial campaign turned up a $500 contribution
from Sacramento lobbying company Hunter/Ruiz.</TE>

<HD>Recycling of Green Waste Is Threatened</HD>
<DH>Plants: Discovery of weed killer in compost sets back
conservation effort, official says.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Growing evidence of a commercial herbicide in municipal compost has
heightened concerns about the future of green waste recycling in
California--a thriving business that could be seriously jeopardized
if its end product is contaminated.</LD>
<LD>   The herbicide, which has shown up in compost in San Diego and Los
Angeles, is clopyralid, a weed killer. Manufactured by Dow
AgroSciences, it is not harmful to people. But even trace amounts in
compost can stunt or kill plants such as peas, peppers, tomatoes,
potatoes and daisies. Clopyralid is used to kill dandelions in lawns
and thistles on farmland and parkland.</LD>
<LD>   Clopyralid in compost was detected in Washington state in 1999,
and now is seen as a threat to green waste recycling programs.
California has the most ambitious standards in the country for
recycling lawn waste. During the past 10 years, the state has
required cities and counties to divert 50% of their waste from
landfills by 2000. Those that didn't comply faced penalties as high
as $10,000 a day. Final results are not in, but Los Angeles diverted
55%.</LD>
<TE>   Howard Levenson, California Integrated Waste Management Board
supervisor, said clopyralid could put an end to the state's recycling
success story and force tainted compost back to landfills.</TE>
<TE>   "We're very concerned about the potential presence of this
chemical and how it might impact the compost marketplace and how that
then impacts our waste diversion programs," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The chemical was introduced to California in 1997. In 2000, about
13,000 pounds of clopyralid was used in 54 of the state's 58
counties.</TE>
<TE>   The chemical is popular with lawn care companies because one
application lasts as long as a year. But the same persistence has
made it a problem for the firms that convert garden waste to compost.</TE>
<TE>   Alerted in May by reports of clopyralid damage to tomato and
potato crops in Washington state, San Diego's Environmental Services
Department started testing its compost and got its first positive
results in June, and its second last week.</TE>
<TE>   In late January, Los Angeles officials found clopyralid residue in
compost.</TE>
<TE>   "We naturally are becoming alarmed," said Stephen Fortune, the
principal sanitary engineer with the Bureau of Sanitation. Los
Angeles manages to meet its landfill quotas only by diverting 2,000
tons a day of yard waste for composting.</TE>
<TE>   Statewide, green waste amounts to about a third of the 66 million
tons of waste generated each year.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a big part of the waste stream, which is why cities and
counties have made such an effort to collect that stuff and keep it
out of the landfill," said Ronnie Java, spokeswoman for the
California Integrated Waste Management Board.</TE>
<TE>   Stephen Grealy, San Diego's recycling program supervisor, said the
presence of clopyralid in compost threatens the state's entire
composting program. "All of our green waste recycling efforts that
have been promoted and developed by the city and state for the last
20 years are at risk because of this," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The most immediate threat to compost comes from contaminated grass
clippings. Department of Pesticide Regulation records show that
almost half the clopyralid used in the state is applied by
landscaping companies. The heaviest applications are in Sonoma, Santa
Clara, Contra Costa and Los Angeles counties.</TE>
<TE>   In Washington state, where clopyralid has been used since 1987,
contamination is so pervasive that Mike Pearson, lab director of the
firm doing most of the tests, said 90% of tests for the chemical have
been positive.</TE>
<TE>   After public meetings in January, the Washington State Department
of Agriculture is circulating draft rules that propose banning
clopyralid from landscaping uses where clippings from treated plants
are likely to enter the compost stream.</TE>
<TE>   Dow spokesman Garry Hamlin said the company does not plan to
contest the decision.</TE>
<TE>   Inspired by proposed Washington restrictions, recently the
California Compost Quality Council, a Sonoma-based trade association,
pushed for a statewide testing program that might result in similar
rules in California. It distributed a mass mailing offering a special
rate for testing. It will present these to the California Integrated
Waste Management Board on March 6.</TE>
<TE>   An Environmental Protection Agency spokesman said the federal
government also is monitoring clopyralid, and has an e-mail address
for composters to use in reporting contamination: clopy
ralid.compost@epa.gov.</TE>
<TE>   But it remains unclear how many composters will voluntarily
consent to tests. Most of the state's 100 compost facilities are run
by private contractors that could face bankruptcy if their product is
tainted.</TE>

<HD>School Offers Grueling, Rickety Ride to Success</HD>
<DH>Education: Without much money, Nativity Prep determines to
help students who might otherwise fail.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DEBORAH SULLIVAN BRENNAN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL>SAN DIEGO</DL>
<LD>The van that shuttles students from Nativity Prep Academy to their
swimming lessons and field trips has logged nearly 200,000 miles and
is pushing 20 years old. On the outside, it's a dun-gray clunker.</LD>
<LD>   On the inside, however, it's a vehicle of opportunity for 19
low-income kids who might otherwise be languishing below grade level
in overcrowded public classrooms.</LD>
<LD>   As school founder and President David Rivera sees it, the vehicle
is emblematic of the cash-strapped, first-year school: both
struggling day to day to keep going. Housed in a converted warehouse
east of downtown, Nativity Prep is a nonprofit Catholic school that
aims to take children likely to drop out of high school and prepare
them to go to college instead. Its first class of 19 fifth-graders
studies 12 hours a day--a rigorous regimen of academic basics,
enrichment classes and religion--all free to their families.</LD>
<TE>   "Our mission, our dedicated purpose, is to send these children
with little hope and less opportunity on to college," Rivera said.</TE>
<TE>   The school grew out of a religious awakening by Rivera. The son of
Latino community leaders in San Diego, Rivera, 34, eschewed their
tradition of service in favor of a six-digit income as a real estate
agent.</TE>
<TE>   Living in a seaside condo and indulging in what he called "the sin
and vice of youth," he said he had a religious revelation at 25 and
decided to return to school. Rivera studied political science at the
University of San Diego and obtained a law degree from the University
of Notre Dame in 1999.</TE>
<TE>   Returning to San Diego, he researched schools and children's
programs and finally settled on a model developed by Jesuit priests
in New York, who started the first "Nativity" school in 1971. The
program emphasized intensive instruction, small classes and extended
school days.</TE>
<TE>   Enlisting the aid of his alma mater, the University of San Diego,
Rivera resolved to open Nativity Prep.</TE>
<TE>   "He's an incredible salesman," said Paula Cordeiro, dean of USD's
School of Education. "It's hard not to respond to a well-thought-out
initiative that is going to help children who are living in poverty."</TE>
<TE>   Rivera applied the same passion to his quest for funds, piecing
together many small donations and a few bigger grants.</TE>
<TE>   "David is a very charismatic, energetic guy on a mission," said
Nativity Prep board member and auto dealer Bob Hoehn, who has donated
about $70,000 to the school.</TE>
<TE>   With Nativity Prep's principal, Bob Heveron, and its educational
consultant, Brian Bennett, both veteran Catholic school
administrators, Rivera then recruited teachers through the AmeriCorps
program. The school hired 10 recent college graduates. The teachers
receive $35 weekly stipends, free tuition toward teaching credentials
and master's programs at the University of San Diego, and free room
and board.</TE>
<TE>   Nativity Prep opened Sept. 17, welcoming students who were at
least two years below grade level academically and from families
earning less than $22,000 per year. Students start the day at 7 a.m.
with the Lord's Prayer and the Pledge of Allegiance, then move on to
breakfast, followed by two-hour blocks of language arts and math.
Some afternoons it's theater and art class; other days it's music or
science.</TE>
<TE>   The students take field trips to Mission Bay, conducting
experiments with Aquatics Adventure, a nonprofit educational
foundation. On a recent school day, the children, some of whom had
never attended a science class before this year, reviewed the
salinity, phosphate and fecal coliform levels of a water sample they
had tested the week before.Margarita Vera said her son Jose seems to
watch less television and be more social since he enrolled. She said
his old school, with its large classrooms, "is like a general
practitioner, compared to a specialist doctor here."</TE>
<TE>   The 12-hour school days sound grueling, but students say they're
fun. The long days of work and nights of university classes don't
faze the teachers, either. "It's been exhilarating, humbling, fun,"
said teacher Caroline Sekula, 22. School officials plan to expand the
program to include sixth grade next year. For now, though, just
keeping the doors open each month has been a labor of love and a leap
of faith.</TE>
<TE>   This month its reserves are down to a few thousand dollars. "I'm
not worried about the funding, because it will come," Rivera said.</TE>

<LD>Californians' love affair with term limits goes back more than 10
years and, like many loves, it hasn't lived up to its promises. That
is reason to vote no March 5 on Los Angeles County Charter Amendment
A, which would enforce limits for all elected county officials, and
Charter Amendment B, for county supervisors only.</LD>
<LD>   The flirtation began with limiting state legislators in 1990.
Assembly members, now restricted to six years in office, barely
figure out what they're doing before they're forced out. Senators,
with eight years, become lame ducks after four. Institutional memory
is lost. Only lobbyists remain constant--and grow increasingly
powerful. By all reports, utility companies essentially wrote the
details of the 1996 law deregulating electricity while mostly newbie
lawmakers stood by. The result? Last year's rolling blackouts and
rate increases.</LD>
<TE>   The Los Angeles City Council will be in the same mess in a few
years when every seat will have turned over. If trends hold up, a
good number of the candidates running to fill those seats will be
termed-out legislators. Term limits don't necessarily send
politicians back to the ranks of civilians. Lame-duck leaders just
spend their second terms thinking about which office to run for next.
And forget long-term planning or projects that take years of patient
nurturing to come to fruition. City Council veteran Hal Bernson
fought for two decades to make the abandoned Chatsworth Reservoir a
nature preserve. No one will take up such long and difficult crusades
tomorrow.</TE>
<TE>   Term-limit advocates were attempting to fix turnover's opposite,
stagnation. A favorite example is the county supervisors, who seem to
acquire lifelong tenure by virtue of huge districts that make
opposing them prohibitively costly. In the March 5 election one
incumbent up for reelection is unopposed and the other has a single,
little-known opponent. But there are better fixes than term limits,
ones that don't create new problems. The supervisors passed campaign
finance reforms in 1996 that set contribution and spending limits; a
public matching-funds program would do even more to help opponents
get their messages out and give voters choices. Increasing the size
of the five-member Board of Supervisors--something voters have so far
declined to do--would help dilute each individual's power and open up
the board to fresh faces.</TE>
<TE>   The Board of Supervisors reluctantly placed term limits on the
ballot to settle a lawsuit brought by supporters of a citizens
initiative campaign. Should either amendment pass it would almost
certainly wind up in court.</TE>
<TE>   Amendments A and B would impose three-term, or 12-year, limits.
That's better than what the state and city have but still not as good
as what voters can do now: turn out a bad politician after one term
or keep a good one in office past three terms. Whatever problems
government may have, term limits aren't the fix they have been sold
as. Vote no on Charter Amendments A and B.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Ishmael Beah was 13 years old when soldiers in Sierra Leone dragged
him onto the battlefield. His family had disappeared during that West
African nation's civil war, and he wandered the countryside starved
for food and solace. As he told students at Southern California high
schools and colleges last week, he eventually turned to the army.
Suddenly he found an automatic rifle in his hands.</LD>
<LD>   ''At first I couldn't pull the trigger," he said. "I was lying
almost numb in ambush watching kids my age being shot and killed. The
sight of blood and the crying of people in pain triggered something
inside me that I didn't understand and made me lose compassion for
others. I lost my real being.''</LD>
<LD>   He found peace, he said, "writing song lyrics about the good times
before the war." Then one day, amid war's chaos, a relative rescued
Beah and enrolled him in school. But 300,000 other children, some as
young as 8 years old, are currently fighting wars in Angola, Burma,
Colombia, Sierra Leone, Sri Lanka, Congo, Afghanistan and many other
countries.</LD>
<TE>   Hoping to save some of these children from the loss of innocence
he experienced, not to mention the loss of their lives, Beah has
joined the Human Rights Watch Student Task Force, a Los Angeles-based
advocacy group that is calling on members of the Senate Foreign
Relations Committee to support U.S. ratification of an international
agreement to prohibit armies from enlisting children as soldiers.</TE>
<TE>   The committee should recommend to the Senate the ratification of
the so-called Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of
the Child, which prohibits the forced recruitment of children under
18 and voluntary participation under 17.</TE>
<TE>   Ninety-four countries, including the United States, have signed
the protocol, but only 14 have ratified it. The Bush administration
has indicated that it considers ratification a priority. The Senate
should push for that action. Not that existing mechanisms can fully
enforce the ban. But anything that civilized nations can do to make
the inherent inhumanity of warfare less so is worth pursuing.</TE>

<HD>A Shield Against Stalkers</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Stalkers are a strange breed of bully, as Meg Ryan and countless less
famous people have had the misfortune to find out. A woman looks up
and there he is, outside her bedroom window, in the lobby of her
office, in her car's rearview mirror. A man pokes an answering
machine button and out pour 33 messages from a woman whose tone
suggests she is one unsettling shade shy of stability.</LD>
<LD>   Some stalkers cunningly refrain from threatening overtly. Others
suffer delusions that make them think their attention is sought.
Neither a verbalized threat nor the stalker's intention determines
whether someone has a legitimate right to be frightened. Yet
California's anti-stalking law requires proof  that stalkers openly
threatened and intended to scare.</LD>
<LD>   This potentially deadly weakness can be fixed. The state defines a
stalker  as anyone who "willfully, maliciously and repeatedly follows
or harasses another person and who makes a credible threat with the
intent to place that person in reasonable fear for their safety or
the safety of their immediate family." The Legislature should fix the
language to focus on the terrifying behavior that causes a victim to
fear for his or her safety, which may or may not include provable
intention or an overt threat.</LD>
<TE>   The man who last month broke into a Malibu house that he thought
belonged to the actress Ryan illustrates the law's shortcomings. He
claimed Ryan was his fiancee and had forgotten to leave a key for him
under the doormat. So he broke a window and made himself at home. The
actress says she has never met the guy--and doesn't want to. She
succeeded last week in getting a three-year civil restraining order
that requires him to stay at least 150 yards away from her.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the man--who last year armed himself and tried to break
into President Bush's Texas ranch--told sheriff's deputies he will
find Ryan no matter where she goes. Yet, because he didn't make an
overt threat, he faces only two misdemeanor counts of aggravated
trespassing, which could land him in jail for just one year. He
should face a more serious felony stalking charge that carries a
five-year sentence.</TE>
<TE>   Stalkers do not target celebrities only. Plumbers and nurses have
suffered the experience of being shadowed by a neighbor, spurned
boyfriend or obsessed stranger. That heart-in-the-throat,
can't-sleep-at-night fear is real, even when there is no threatening
letter or shout of "I'm going to kill you."</TE>
<TE>   Law enforcement used to treat stalking as a private dispute, often
taking no action until it was too late. Actress Theresa Saldana
launched a public awareness campaign about the issue after a deranged
drifter stalked and then repeatedly stabbed her in 1982. But the law
changed only after television actress Rebecca Schaeffer opened a door
to her killer in 1989.</TE>
<TE>   California's anti-stalking law, the first of its kind in the
nation, went into effect in 1991. Since then, the governor and
Legislature have toughened the law and increased the penalties. But
the law is still not tough enough. A simple change could save lives.</TE>

<HD>Norman Davidson, 85; DNA Research Pioneer</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MYRNA OLIVER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Norman Davidson, a groundbreaking Caltech chemical biologist who
earned the National Medal of Science for his preparatory work in
mapping properties of DNA and the human genome, has died. He was 85.</LD>
<LD>   Davidson died Thursday at Huntington Memorial Hospital in Pasadena
of unspecified causes after a brief illness.</LD>
<LD>   When President Bill Clinton awarded Davidson the medal in 1996, he
cited the scientist for "breakthroughs in chemistry and biology which
have led to the earliest understanding of the overall structure of
genomes."</LD>
<TE>   "Davidson's research on DNA," the White House statement said,
"established the principle of nucleic acid renaturation, one of the
most important principles in molecular biology and a primary tool for
deciphering the structure and function of genes."</TE>
<TE>   The professor was a founding member of the advisory council to the
Human Genome Project.</TE>
<TE>   Davidson was not only prominent in his field for more than half a
century, he helped create it.</TE>
<TE>   Known for bridging the gap between physical and biological
sciences, he developed new methods in physical chemistry and electron
microscopy now used in genetic mapping.</TE>
<TE>   "His movement into biology from a background in chemistry allowed
him to play a special role in the development of molecular biology,"
said Caltech President David Baltimore, adding that Davidson
"symbolized the essence of the institute [Caltech]."</TE>
<TE>   A fixture on the Caltech campus since 1946, Davidson officially
retired from teaching in 1986 but served as executive officer for
biology from 1989 to 1997, chairing the division briefly.</TE>
<TE>   He continued his research until his death, driving about the
campus in an electric cart. Davidson had held the Norman Chandler
Chair of Chemical Biology, endowed by the family of former Times
Publisher Norman Chandler.</TE>
<TE>   Born in Chicago, Davidson earned a bachelor's degree in chemistry
at the University of Chicago and another at Oxford University in
England as a Rhodes scholar, then returned to the University of
Chicago for a doctorate in chemistry.</TE>
<TE>   During World War II, he worked for the National Defense Research
Committee Project at USC, for the Division of War Research at
Columbia and the University of Chicago and then with the Plutonium
Project in development of the atomic bomb. After the war, he worked
briefly as a researcher at RCA and then joined Caltech to teach
chemistry.</TE>
<TE>   In 1980, he was named California Scientist of the Year by the
California Museum of Science and Industry. He also received the Peter
Debye Award from the American Chemical Society in 1971 and the
Dickson Prize for Science in 1985.</TE>
<TE>   Davidson is survived by his wife of 60 years, Annemarie; four
children, Brian Davidson of Walnut Creek, Jeff Davidson of Cayucos,
Laureen Agee of Mammoth Lakes and Terry Davidson of Poway; and eight
grandchildren.</TE>

<HD>Harry Harris, 88; Celebrated AP Photographer</HD>

<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Harry Harris, a celebrated Associated Press photographer who captured
images of the U.S. 1st Army marching across Europe during World War
II, as well as Hank Aaron hitting his record-breaking 715th home run,
has died. He was 88.</LD>
<LD>   Harris, who worked for AP for nearly half a century until his
retirement in 1978, died Feb. 12 at Brookhaven Memorial Hospital on
Long Island after a brief illness, said his granddaughter, Michelle
Abramson.</LD>
<LD>   "Harry was one of the icons in the profession," said Joe DeMaria,
president of the New York Press Photographers Assn., of which Harris
also served as president. "The guy was absolutely phenomenal.
Anything he did, he did with 150%."</LD>
<TE>   During World War II, Harris "was always quite popular with the
guys," said "60 Minutes" commentator Andy Rooney. He remembered a
brawl between Ernest Hemingway and another reporter that Harris broke
up in a hotel room in Rambouillet, France.</TE>
<TE>   "Here's Harris, who stood about 5-5, in between these two guys,
putting his hands on their chests," Rooney said.</TE>
<TE>   "I still laugh about it when I think about it today. He was really
trying to be the peacemaker."</TE>
<TE>   Harris is survived by his wife, Lynn; a son, Michael; three
grandchildren; and two great-grandchildren.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Lev Feoktistov, a leading Soviet nuclear weapons designer who later
joined a wave of scientists urging nuclear disarmament, died
Thursday--his 74th birthday--in Moscow of an apparent heart attack,
Russian news agencies reported.</LD>
<LD>   He was a member of the Russian Academy of Sciences and a
department chairman at the academy's Lebedev Physics Institute.</LD>
<LD>   Feoktistov worked from 1951 until the late 1970s designing nuclear
warheads in the Soviet Union's Arzamas-16 and Chelyabinsk-70
facilities, according to "Nukes Are Not Forever," a book he published
in English in 1999.</LD>
<TE>   He later moved to Moscow to work on civilian research. He became
an active participant in the international Pugwash movement of
scientists campaigning to eliminate nuclear weapons.</TE>

<HD>Richard Hare, 82; Influential British Philosopher</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Richard Mervyn Hare, 82, an influential British philosopher who
believed passionately that there are rational justifications for
behaving morally, died Jan. 29 at his home near Oxford, England, of
undisclosed causes.</LD>
<LD>   Hare, a longtime professor of philosophy at Oxford University, was
an advocate of "prescriptivism," arguing that moral beliefs can be
defended through objective reasoning.</LD>
<LD>   He outlined his ideas rejecting the notion that moral statements
are simply expressions of emotion in books such as "The Language of
Morals" in 1952 and "Freedom and Reason" in 1963.</LD>
<TE>   Prescriptivism--a term derived from Hare's belief that moral
judgments prescribe specific, universal courses of action--was
influential through the 1950s and 1960s. It later fell from fashion,
but Hare never wavered. His life's ambition, he said, was to find a
way of answering moral questions rationally.</TE>
<TE>   Hare enlisted in the Royal Artillery during World War II, was
captured after the fall of Singapore in 1942, and spent three years
as a Japanese prisoner of war forced to help build the notorious
Thai-Burma Railway.</TE>
<TE>   After the war, he taught at Oxford, and from 1983 to 1994 was a
research professor at the University of Florida.</TE>

<BD>From Times Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Sir Walter Winterbottom, 89, the first full-time manager of England's
national soccer team, died Saturday at the Royal Surrey County
Hospital in Guildford, England. No cause of death was given.</LD>
<LD>   From 1946 to 1962, Winterbottom guided the team through four World
Cups. His record of 78 wins in 139 matches is the best of any postwar
England coach, even though he failed to win any major title.</LD>
<LD>   Born in Oldham, Winterbottom played as a defender for Manchester
United before a spinal disease ended his playing career in 1939. He
served as a wing commander in the Royal Air Force during World War II
and later worked as a physical education teacher.</LD>
<TE>   Named chief coach by the Football Assn. in 1946 and manager a year
later, he not only arranged his players' travel but sometimes cooked
their meals.</TE>
<TE>   He was knighted for his service to sports in 1978.</TE>

<HD>The Spies Come Out for Presidents Day</HD>
<DH>Holiday: A new exhibit on espionage is an eye-opener at
annual Reagan Library event.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HOLLY J. WOLCOTT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Abraham Lincoln impersonator was popular posing for souvenir
photographs, and hot dog sales were brisk, but the biggest draw
Monday at Ronald Reagan Presidential Library were the spy gadgets.</LD>
<LD>   To celebrate Presidents Day, hundreds of people came to the
hilltop museum near Simi Valley to see a deadly poison-dart umbrella,
a lipstick tube with a hidden recording device and, of course,
Maxwell Smart's shoe phone.</LD>
<LD>   A recitation of the Gettysburg Address and sunny picnic weather
vied for attention, but by 11 a.m. a line had formed at the front
door for the museum's newest exhibit, "Spies: Secrets from the CIA,
KGB and Hollywood."</LD>
<TE>   "Considering all that's going on in the world right now and how
much of this stuff is kept secret, this is awesome," said Harry Danes
of Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   The exhibition, which opened Monday, marks the first time several
of the gadgets have been shown publicly.</TE>
<TE>   Many of the more than 400 devices on display are on loan for the
next five months from the CIA's private museum in Langley, Va. Other
pieces were borrowed from private collectors.</TE>
<TE>   For the $5 price of a ticket, visitors saw tire spikes, bombs and
various pistols, along with several concealed cameras, including one
hidden in a suit jacket and another in a leather glove.</TE>
<TE>   One section of the exhibition includes television and movie
paraphernalia, such as the fake tarantula that nearly killed 007 in
"Dr. No," and Diana Rigg's leather pants from the spy show "The
Avengers."</TE>
<TE>   "I've been watching reruns of James Bond movies the last few
Saturdays and decided it would be cool to see some of this stuff up
close," said Brianna Millhouse of Oxnard.</TE>
<TE>   While lines of people inched their way through the exhibition
hall, dozens more relaxed at outdoor tables, where several
presidential look-alikes strolled and chatted with the visitors about
American history.</TE>
<TE>   "I shock people every once in a while," said Jay Koch, a Port
Hueneme resident who looks like President Reagan, albeit a few inches
shorter.</TE>
<TE>   Joan O'Brien of Simi Valley brought granddaughter Codi Rex, 6, to
see Thomas Jefferson and George Washington look-alikes and inspect
the youth activities, which included coloring pictures of presidents.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a great education for the kids and an opportunity for them
to learn a little bit about history," O'Brien said.</TE>

<HD>Boy, 16, Stabbed to Death Walking Home From Bar</HD>
<DH>Santa Paula: The teen was with his uncle and another man,
who were wounded. Police say robbery was the motive.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TIMOTHY HUGHES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A 16-year-old boy who worked as a farm laborer to earn money for his
family in Mexico was stabbed to death early Monday as he walked home
from a Santa Paula bar with his uncle and another man.</LD>
<LD>   Salvador Perez Chavez of Santa Paula was pronounced dead at the
scene in the 200 block of South Garcia Street, said Santa Paula
Police Det. Ish Cordero.</LD>
<LD>   His uncle, Luis Perez Gonzales, 22, and Juan Amezquita, 23, both
of Santa Paula, also were attacked. They were treated for minor stab
wounds at a local hospital and released.</LD>
<TE>   Detectives believe robbery was the motive and that there were at
least three attackers who ran off with an undetermined amount of
cash.</TE>
<TE>   "I was freaked out because that just doesn't happen here," said
Veronica Hernandez, who lives across the street from where the
teenager was killed. "People are always coming [down the street] from
that bar, but no one ever hassles us."</TE>
<TE>   Authorities believe the victims left Ruben's Lounge on nearby
Harvard Boulevard and were walking toward Amezquita's house about a
block away when they were approached by the assailants.</TE>
<TE>   One or more of the attackers demanded money and then stabbed all
three victims before fleeing on foot, Cordero said. A search for the
assailants continued Monday night.</TE>
<TE>   Cordero also said detectives would investigate whether the
underage victim had been drinking at the bar. If he was, authorities
planned to alert state beverage officials.</TE>
<TE>   Local businessman Ruben Pena, who once owned the bar and still
holds its liquor license, denied that any minor was served alcohol
there.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities said Chavez was living with his uncle in Santa Paula
and trying to earn money to send to his parents, who live in the
Mexican state of Guanajuato. Gonzales and Amezquita also work as farm
laborers.</TE>
<TE>   An autopsy performed Monday found Chavez died from stab wounds to
the chest. Coroner's officials said his body probably would be
returned to Mexico for burial.</TE>
<TE>   The incident was the city's first homicide this year.</TE>

<LD>   It was the third fatal training accident in California in 12 days.</LD>
<LD>   The crash occurred just after 2 p.m. at the combat center's
airfield, said Capt. Teresa Ovalle. The pilot and weapons systems
officer ejected from the F/A-18D Hornet, which was based at the
Marine Corps Air Station at Beaufort, S.C. The pilot, whose name was
withheld pending notification of family, was treated at Robert E.
Bush Naval Hospital and released.</LD>

<HD>Many Boomers Keep Tight Rein on Teenagers</HD>
<DH>Trends: Children of the '60s, many of whom did drugs and
other things, say today's world is riskier, a study finds.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ANNE-MARIE O'CONNOR</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>They tuned in, turned on and dropped out.</LD>
<LD>   But a new USC study of parents who came of age in the 1960s found
that many say they are keeping their own children on a much shorter
leash.</LD>
<LD>   "Many baby-boomer parents who grew up in the sex-and-drug-drenched
1960s are keeping an unapologetic rein on their teenagers," according
to a summary of the study, which will be released today. "Today's
parents, even those who were raised in liberal households, are
undertaking dramatic reversals from how they were brought up," said
USC sociology professor Elaine Bell Kaplan, author of the study.</LD>
<TE>   "I had assumed that parents who grew up in the liberal 1960s--with
its emphasis on civil rights--would be sympathetic to their
children's privacy rights."</TE>
<TE>   In fact, "the parents who used the most control over their child
were parents of the '60s. Some were former hippies," Kaplan said.
"They said, 'I did the sex and rock stuff.' Now they see the
consequences of it: HIV, drug addiction."</TE>
<TE>   Even so, a lot of the parents look back on the America of the
tumultuous 1960s as a much safer place, with fewer potential pitfalls
and dangers. One typical mother affectionately recalled her "hippy
life" in San Francisco, doing "everything from expressing myself
sexually to doing coke and other drugs."</TE>
<TE>   But such youthful experimentation with sex and drugs seems tame
compared with the real-life drugs-and-guns dramas that ensnare the
teenagers they see in the news today--children from middle-class
families a lot like their own.</TE>
<TE>   "There's more to fear now," another mother said.</TE>
<TE>   The parents' worst fears revolve around the kinds of young people
they see on television news: The boy who crashed a private plane into
a Tampa, Fla., high-rise. The young man from Marin County who fought
with the Taliban in Afghanistan. The two teenagers who shot and
killed 12 students and a teacher at Colorado's Columbine High
School--all unleashing criticism that parents did not know what went
on in their children's secret world until it was too late.</TE>
<TE>   Parents said the spate of school shootings made them wonder if
their sons, too, were capable of violence. They said they were
disconcerted by media accounts of families who say they were
blindsided by their sons' crimes.</TE>
<TE>   "It's like the young man accused of raping the girl in Orange
County; his parents described him as quiet and well-behaved," Kaplan
said. "What's really going on in their kids' lives?"</TE>
<TE>   Some parents are resorting to unusual measures to try to make sure
they find out. They are spying on their children's e-mail,
eavesdropping on their phone conversations and searching their rooms.</TE>
<TE>   Most evidence, Kaplan said, suggests that American children
overall are doing well. But parents, haunted by news reports that fan
their worst fears, are concerned, and "with some reason," she said.</TE>
<TE>   "These kids are living in a different kind of environment than 10
years ago," she said. "The culture views them as more sophisticated,
and treats them as if they can handle more than they really can. Boys
are being sexualized more quickly than they can deal with it."</TE>
<TE>   Ironically, it was mostly parents raised in conservative
households who told Kaplan they could trust their children on their
own. Parents raised in liberal households told her they were afraid
of what might happen if they gave their children more free rein.</TE>
<TE>   Kaplan interviewed 32 parents for the study, a third of them from
Southern California and two-thirds from Northern California. The
two-year study was funded by the UC Berkeley Center for Working
Families with funding from the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation.</TE>
<TE>   Kaplan said the parents constituted an average sampling for a
qualitative study based on extensive interviews. The parents were
college-educated professionals: lawyers, movie industry executives,
nurses and computer analysts. Their annual incomes ranged from
$65,000 to $150,000.</TE>
<TE>   Four of the parents were Latino, seven African American and 21
white, and they ranged in age from 39 to 55. The children ranged from
12 to 17 years old. Two-thirds were enrolled in private schools.</TE>
<TE>   The parents seemed to find children less easy to control,
something Kaplan attributed to their empowerment at young ages by
advertising, TV shows and films that pander to the youth culture.</TE>
<TE>   "Kids argue, 'You're not the boss of me,'" Kaplan said. "They're
in a culture that is quite different than years ago."</TE>
<TE>   One mother complained of having to worry about her teenagers
drinking and having sex as early as middle school. Other parents
worried that rap music lyrics emphasizing violence and degrading sex
were influencing their children.</TE>
<TE>   "If I had known it was going to be this hard," one parent told
Kaplan, "I wouldn't have had a kid."</TE>
<TE>   Parents had several strategies for keeping tabs on their children.</TE>
<TE>   One mother of two teenagers, knowing that her daughter had tried
Ecstasy, hugs them when they return to see if she can detect the
scent of alcohol or marijuana.</TE>
<TE>   A father began to read his son's e-mail after the Columbine
shooting--until his son caught on and learned to erase it. Several
mothers, after reading that one of the Columbine shooters kept
weapons in his closet, began to search their sons' rooms.</TE>
<TE>   One Bay Area mother interviewed for the study recalls being "out
there smoking dope and demonstrating for women's causes" when she was
young.</TE>
<TE>   As a parent, she has taken a sharp U-turn, fearing what could
happen if her son became involved in drugs. She is determined to
avoid it--by any means necessary.</TE>
<TE>   She has even developed a "crazy mom" routine to control her son.
She tried it once when he was out past midnight at a "drug party."</TE>
<TE>   "I got the address of the party and I was so mad," she told
Kaplan. "I jumped into my car, hair in rollers, PJs and slippers and
went over just as Mark was coming out. I yelled at the top of my
voice: 'Mark, Mark, here I am.'"</TE>
<TE>   Since then, she has found that the threat of subjecting her son to
this humiliating tactic "really works for me."</TE>
<TE>   "Can you imagine seeing your mother in her pajamas and rollers
standing on the front lawn of your friends' house?" she said. "He
took one look at me and ran for the car."</TE>

<HD>A Place That Welcomes the 'Ghetto Kids'</HD>
<DH>Youth: A new center embraces education, and hip-hop
culture, in effort to curb gang violence.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SUFIYA ABDUR-RAHMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Being at the Pico Youth and Family Center is sort of like hanging out
at a friend's house--a friend who happens to be the coolest kid in
high school.</LD>
<LD>   He's got a couple of buddies battling for the video game
championship on the big screen in the living room. In his bedroom,
someone's installing the latest programs on his computer. And in the
basement, thumping bass and scattered rhymes abound as a few friends
freestyle and scratch records on his turntables.</LD>
<LD>   This is the dream that Oscar de la Torre had for the youths of the
Pico neighborhood in Santa Monica almost four years ago, when a rash
of homicides and shootings shocked the otherwise first-rate city. The
city set aside more than $300,000 for him and two others to develop a
teen center, which was supposed to help curb gang violence, the
suspected cause of the fall 1998 shootings.</LD>
<TE>   But that collaboration between the three men whom the city chose
to develop the project fell apart, and the original center was never
built.</TE>
<TE>   De la Torre, a former Santa Monica High School counselor, did not
give up on his goal, though. He stuck it out with the city, and in
January opened the Pico Youth and Family Center.</TE>
<TE>   "Out of all that crazy stuff that went down, this is what we
envisioned," De la Torre said.</TE>
<TE>   Just inside the doors at 828 Pico Blvd., three large paintings of
cultural heroes hang from the wall symbolizing the center's mantra.
"Promoting peace, unity and social justice," De la Torre said,
standing beneath the watchful eyes of Cesar Chavez, Malcolm X and
Rigoberta Menchu, a Mayan from Guatemala who won the 1992 Nobel Peace
Prize for her work on behalf of indigenous people's rights.</TE>
<TE>   The three different perspectives that De la Torre, Manuel Lares
and Edward Bell--the collaborators--brought to the initial project
were part of the reason for its failure, De la Torre said. Each man
envisioned a different program and trying to combine the three
visions just didn't work.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm just glad Oscar has pulled through and made this project
happen," said Lares, who now runs the Santa Monica chapter of Barrios
Unidos, a national youth violence-prevention program.</TE>
<TE>   To make the Pico center work, De la Torre sought help from
Woodcraft Rangers, an 80-year-old nonprofit agency in Los Angeles
that provides academic and recreation services to Los Angeles County
youth. The Rangers got a $320,000 grant from Santa Monica and took on
the Pico center as a project.</TE>
<TE>   Woodcraft Rangers provide administrative and financial assistance
to the Pico center, said Cathie Mostovoy, its chief executive
officer. But all the youth services, including job training and
placement, are offered in the center.</TE>
<TE>   "Will we stop the violence in the first year? No," De la Torre
said of the center he founded. "We're one part of the solution. We
give young people a voice, to empower young people."</TE>
<TE>   In the center's foyer, there's a round table with chairs where
students from UCLA's Xinachtli program for college-bound youth tutor
students in need. Counselors and case managers are on hand for
individual and family sessions.</TE>
<TE>   Computers are being hooked up with high-speed digital access so
youths can learn Web-page design. De la Torre is in the process of
building a video library of Latino and African American cultural
films for the 51-inch television screen.</TE>
<TE>   "It's got to be educational," De la Torre said. "It's cool to play
video games, but I also want them to learn."</TE>
<TE>   Equally as important as education, he said, is having youths
express what they know the way they know how. That's why there's an
entire room dedicated to music production and another room with some
walls covered with graffiti.</TE>
<TE>   "We're going to talk to young people through the medium of hip-hop
music," De la Torre said as a few young men tested the studio's
microphones, speakers, keyboard, synthesizer, turntables and
mini-disc player.</TE>
<TE>   "It's about what makes your heart ring, makes your heart sing,"
rhymed Dennis Jackson, 24.</TE>
<TE>   Also important in hip-hop culture is graffiti. Three walls in the
center are covered with multicolored, oversized, bubbled letters in
an effort to "decriminalize" graffiti, De la Torre said, "because
this is beautiful; for us, it's art." He said he plans to paint over
the walls every six months and have new taggers come in to paint.</TE>
<TE>   It's what he calls "ghetto kids' expression." The youths seem to
like the center.</TE>
<TE>   "It's for, like, older kids. Not like the Boys Club or PAL," said
Richard Hernandez, 18, who can't attend the other clubs at his age.
The Pico center is specifically for 16- to 24-year-olds.</TE>
<TE>   Erika Ramirez, 21, a UCLA student who tutors at the center, said
she likes it because "it's not academic solely. It's trying to
develop all aspects of the student in a much more relaxed environment
than school."</TE>
<TE>   Heriberto Gomez Jr., 19, said of the center's atmosphere: "It's
perfect because it's something that comes from the streets, the
people. So far, it's been keeping me off the streets.... We've been
waiting for this [place] for years."</TE>

<HD>Explosive Device Is Seized at Airport</HD>
<DH>LAX: Guam resident is arrested after X-ray of his carry-on
luggage detects a military firecracker-type charge used to scare
wildlife.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LOUIS SAHAGUN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>An inactive Army National Guardsman was taken into custody at Los
Angeles International Airport early Monday after a military explosive
device was discovered in his carry-on luggage as he prepared to board
a flight to Oakland, federal authorities said.</LD>
<LD>   Jacques Baker, 32, was getting ready to board a United Airlines
flight when he was arrested by airport police on suspicion of
attempting to carry an explosive on board an aircraft, said FBI
spokeswoman Laura Bosley.</LD>
<LD>   The device, which resembled an M-80 firecracker and is typically
used to scare off wildlife, including seals, was detected by security
workers as it passed through an X-ray machine about 6:15 a.m.</LD>
<TE>   No flights were affected by the incident at LAX's Terminal 6,
which was closed for just under an hour as a police bomb squad
confiscated the device and determined that the area was safe to
reopen, said Sgt. Greg Glodery of the Los Angeles Police Department.</TE>
<TE>   "The device was determined not to be a threat," he said. "The fuse
hadn't been lit."</TE>
<TE>   Baker, a U.S. citizen who apparently was traveling alone,
originally boarded a Continental Airlines plane in Guam and flew to
Honolulu, where he boarded a connecting flight to LAX. United's
Flight 596 was scheduled to depart for Oakland at 7 a.m.</TE>
<TE>   "Screeners at our security checkpoint discovered a prohibited
device in his luggage," said United spokesman Chris Brathwaite. "Our
security system worked."</TE>
<TE>   The fact that Baker, who lives in Guam, was having to reenter a
security checkpoint at Terminal 6, which is used by Continental
Airlines and a portion of United Airlines' fleet, suggests that he
apparently had temporarily left the so-called "sterile zone" between
the checkpoint and the aircraft, authorities said.</TE>
<TE>   Officials could not say whether Baker had been traveling with the
device or somehow obtained it after his arrival from Honolulu.</TE>
<TE>   It was the second arrest in two days at LAX. Early Sunday, the FBI
arrested a Danish national identified as Mogens Amdi Petersen on an
Interpol warrant. The FBI declined to provide any details except to
say that the suspect was being held at the downtown Metropolitan
Detention Center and was scheduled to appear before a federal
magistrate today.</TE>
<TE>   The incidents came a day after the U.S. Department of
Transportation assumed ultimate authority over passenger and luggage
screening at all 429 U.S. airports.</TE>
<TE>   As in all commercial airports nationwide since the Sept. 11
terrorist attacks, LAX has remained on a high-alert status. More bags
were being searched by hand, by machines that can detect explosives
and by specially trained dogs, airline officials said.</TE>

<HD>Unwitting Cell Calls Swamp 911 Systems</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JILL LEOVY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Frustrated by the large volume of 911 calls caused by people
accidentally hitting programmed buttons on their cell phones, police
and emergency response authorities are seeking new ways to keep
systems from becoming overloaded.</LD>
<LD>   Nearly two-thirds of all the 911 calls from wireless phones in
California, and even higher proportions elsewhere in the country,
involve people pushing emergency buttons on their cell phone keypads
without knowing it, authorities say.</LD>
<LD>   Local and national authorities say it is impossible to know
whether delays caused by the problem have led to serious injuries or
deaths. But for sure, they say, emergency phone lines are becoming
clogged and 911 operators are finding their jobs more aggravating and
hectic.</LD>
<TE>   "It's just, 'Oops! I didn't mean to call you. Oops! I didn't mean
to call you,' all day long," said Diane Chupinski, communications
supervisor at the California Highway Patrol's Golden Gate
Communications Center in Vallejo.</TE>
<TE>   The CHP handles most wireless 911 calls in the state. Emergency
calls made from non-cellular phones are mostly handled by police and
fire agencies throughout the state.</TE>
<TE>   At the Golden Gate center, which fields wireless 911 calls from
nine Northern California counties, callers wait as long as 90 seconds
for an operator, Chupinski said. In the late 1990s, the average wait
was only eight seconds, she said.</TE>
<TE>   Other wireless 911 centers report similar difficulties. At the CHP
dispatch center in Los Angeles, accidentally placed calls constitute
40% to 60% of the total received.</TE>
<TE>   A police spokesman in Reno said that as many as 75% of all
wireless phone calls into that area's 911 center are accidental on
any given day.</TE>
<TE>   "Our operators just say, 'Hello? Hello? Hello?' And no one's
there," Reno Police Lt. Jim Ballard said.</TE>
<TE>   20 Million Calls Go Wrong Each Year</TE>
<TE>   Accidental 911 wireless calls now total about 20 million a year
nationwide, and the number is increasing by 30% annually, said Roger
Hixson, technical issues director for the National Emergency Number
Assn., an advocacy group in Columbus, Ohio.</TE>
<TE>   Although he could not cite a specific case in which sluggish 911
phone systems hindered response to a genuine emergency, Hixson and
other experts said there is potential for people in trouble to be
harmed, either because of long waits or because 911 operators
mistakenly assume that a disconnected call was unintentional.</TE>
<TE>   "Certainly [such calls] take up time and effort, and in some cases
it causes additional costs," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The problem is not limited to the United States, said Rana Sampson
of Community Policing Associates in San Diego, who has done
consulting work for law enforcement on the issue.</TE>
<TE>   Auto-dial 911 functions are standard on many cell phones. If the
function is not deactivated, each time a phone rolls in a purse or
someone accidentally sits on the keypad, there is a chance that a 911
call will be made, emergency officials say.</TE>
<TE>   Dispatchers describe taking 10 calls in a row in which the only
noise on the other end was a meeting in session, a stereo playing or
someone's conversation.</TE>
<TE>   One of the most common experiences is hearing construction noise,
dispatchers say. They figure that is probably because construction
workers wear phones on their belts and are likely to bump into
things.</TE>
<TE>   "You hear people building roofs, walking on gravel. That is a
sound we have actually learned to recognize," Chupinski said.</TE>
<TE>   "Saws and hammering," echoed Paula Wells, communications
supervisor of the CHP's Los Angeles dispatch center. "Or you hear
schoolteachers with kids in the background. I've even heard the
Pledge of Allegiance."</TE>
<TE>   Some cellular companies have recently moved to fix the problem.
But so many cell phones with auto-dial 911 features have been sold
that officials say the flood of accidental dialing probably is not
likely to ebb soon.</TE>
<TE>   Although most cell phones have lock functions to prevent
accidental calls, some industry insiders concede that many people
don't know how to use them. Many cell phone owners may not read far
enough into their instruction manuals to even know their phones have
a 911 function, they say.</TE>
<TE>   Dispatch officials began to notice the problem a few years ago.
But it has grown acute in the last couple of years as cell phones
have become ubiquitous.</TE>
<TE>   Today, about a quarter of all 911 calls nationwide are from cell
phones--10 times the number a decade ago, said Sampson, the San Diego
consultant.</TE>
<TE>   Hixson said about half of the 5,000 locations across the United
States answering 911 calls handle those from wireless phones.</TE>
<TE>   The CHP has been answering most wireless 911 calls in the state
before routing them to local agencies as needed.</TE>
<TE>   This means the agency has handled so many inadvertent calls that
Los Angeles dispatchers have abandoned the practice of automatically
calling back people who have been cut off. Instead, operators
selectively decide whom to call back based on instinct and
experience.</TE>
<TE>   It's not an ideal system, said Wells, the Los Angeles
communications supervisor. But dispatchers think they have no choice:
If they call back every accidental caller, they jeopardize people
with real emergencies left waiting on the line, she said.</TE>
<TE>   Screening Trial Program Is Dropped</TE>
<TE>   Other 911 dispatch centers face similar tough decisions.</TE>
<TE>   The CHP's Golden Gate center tried a pilot program last year to
screen out accidental calls by routing callers to a recording. The
recording required callers to press a number on their touch pad to
make sure they really wanted 911.</TE>
<TE>   Call volumes to the 911 center immediately plummeted and wait
times dropped back to about eight seconds, Chupinski said.</TE>
<TE>   But the pilot program did not last. Sprint PCS objected because
some of its cell phones did not permit owners to push another button
after dialing 911. The program was ended.</TE>
<TE>   Efforts by the Emergency Number Assn. and other groups to seek
help from cellular phone companies have met with mixed results.</TE>
<TE>   Some companies, such as Nextel Communications and Cingular
Wireless, have cooperated by asking their manufacturers to stop
adding the function to new cellular phones. Nextel has included slips
with its billing statements asking cell phone owners to bring their
old phones in for "upgrades" to remove the auto 911 function.</TE>
<TE>   Nextel spokeswoman Audrey Schaeffer said the Reston, Va.-based
company also has attempted to identify frequent 911 callers to inform
them of the problem, even calling some on the phone, resulting in a
one-third drop in 911 calls from Nextel phones.</TE>
<TE>   But other companies have not moved quite so quickly.
Representatives of Sprint PCS and Verizon Wireless, for example, said
they knew little about the issue of overburdened 911 systems.</TE>
<TE>   "A minuscule number" of Sprint phones sold a few years ago had
auto-dial 911 functions, but current models do not, company
spokeswoman Stephanie Walsh said.</TE>
<TE>   Verizon spokesman Andrew Colley said the feature is "infrequent"
on its phones, and that the company doesn't know exactly which phones
have it because "the only way to tell ... is to go through the manual
for each phone." Besides, he said, some customers like the feature
and program it into phones themselves.</TE>
<TE>   Emergency response officials say they are concerned that the
problem could become more serious as additional local agencies begin
handling 911 calls from cell phones.</TE>
<TE>   The Emergency Number Assn. sent letters to a number of large
wireless companies in December formally seeking their cooperation in
solving the problem. The group joined with other trade associations
to notify the Federal Communications Commission, requesting
"immediate attention" to the issue in a Jan. 9 letter. FCC
spokeswoman Meribeth McCarrick confirmed that the agency had received
the letter and said it is under review.</TE>
<TE>   The problem is "so frustrating to our operators," said Chupinski,
the Bay Area dispatch supervisor. "The public is oblivious."</TE>

<HD>Marchers Demand More Police on Eastside</HD>
<DH>Protest: About 200 residents, angry about a surge in
violent deaths, walk to Parker Center. Chief says killings over
several years are down.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>REBECCA TROUNSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Shaken by a recent surge in violent deaths on their streets,
residents of several Eastside neighborhoods marched on police
headquarters Monday to demand a greater police presence in the
troubled area.</LD>
<LD>   ''We are under siege and we are not getting the services we need
from the Police Department,'' said Ross Valencia, a Boyle Heights
community activist who helped organize the rally. ''We have a dire
need for more protection from the police.''</LD>
<LD>   Fourteen people, including a pregnant young mother and an off-duty
U.S. Marine, have been slain on the Eastside since the first of the
year, most of them in gang-related violence. Last year, 38 people
were killed in the area, which is served by the Los Angeles Police
Department's Hollenbeck Division.</LD>
<TE>   The Eastside figures mirror a trend across the city, officials
have said. In January, there were 76 homicides citywide, nearly twice
the number last year, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   Organizers of Monday's rally, which drew about 200 residents and
community activists to the Boyle Heights neighborhood and then to
police headquarters at Parker Center downtown, sought to distance it
from the current political struggle over leadership of the Police
Department. Mayor James K. Hahn has said that he opposes a second
term for Police Chief Bernard C. Parks.</TE>
<TE>   Several speakers, including Valencia, stressed their support for
the Police Department, even as they said more effort and officers are
needed to fight rising crime.</TE>
<TE>   Politics intervened nonetheless. When Parks appeared to address
the crowd outside his headquarters, several audience members
interrupted, shouting at him and calling for his removal. Others
shouted them down.</TE>
<TE>   Parks urged the marchers to recognize what he called a
''remarkable change'' in the level of violence in their neighborhood
in the last several years, despite the recent spike in homicides.</TE>
<TE>   ''Just a short time ago, Hollenbeck suffered 97 murders in one
year,'' he said, compared with more recent years that averaged 40 or
fewer homicides. ''There's still a lot to be done,'' he added, but
asked the audience to keep the recent figures in perspective.</TE>
<TE>   Residents said they blame the spike in crime on a shortage of
officers at the division, especially those assigned to narcotics and
gang details. Police and city officials have said that the LAPD is
about 1,200 officers below its authorized strength citywide.</TE>
<TE>   Parks and other police officials said the department has tried to
cope with the crime wave by transferring extra resources and officers
into the division.</TE>
<TE>   Capt. Paul Pesqueira of the Hollenbeck Division, who watched the
rally outside Parker Center, said he understood the community's
frustration. He said the additional resources at the division are
beginning to help.</TE>
<TE>   Among those who spoke was George Gutierrez, who witnessed the
death of his brother in January. Robert Gutierrez, 51, was shot to
death in front of his Boyle Heights home Jan. 30 after he confronted
a gang member, police and relatives said.</TE>
<TE>   Standing beside his sister and other family members, George
Gutierrez wept as he appealed to police to do more for the
neighborhood and help prevent another such killing.</TE>
<TE>   ''We're here to share our pain and to support our police,''
Gutierrez said. ''I know they're working beyond the call of duty and
I thank them from my heart. But we need more.''</TE>

<HD>Election Reversal Stirs Passions Even by Compton Standards</HD>
<DH>Power: Some party, some predict chaos as Bradley retakes
office in a city fascinated by its politics.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NANCY WRIDE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Oh, there were promises.</LD>
<LD>   Promises from all sides to abandon Compton's ugly political past.
Promises to temper the operatic rhetoric that has long defined
Compton's nasty elections. Promises to heal this poor city rocked by
election scandal and a corruption investigation still underway.</LD>
<LD>   But in a place where politics can be theater, if not a contact
sport, all the promises among Compton's political combatants
evaporated in less than a day.</LD>
<TE>   Scene: Mayor Omar Bradley's living room the day a court verdict
returned him to power. James Brown is on the stereo, a lively victory
party is underway on the patio. Out front is a passing parade of cars
with jubilant people honking and waving. On the sidewalk, Bradley's
teenage son is on a loudspeaker, joyfully shouting, "We won! We won!
All you people who don't care about Omar Bradley, we won!"</TE>
<TE>   Bradley is on his cellular phone. He's just gotten word that some
of his political foes had entered City Hall. And they appear to be
leaving with filled boxes.</TE>
<TE>   "Capt. Rhambo!" Bradley bellows to Cecil Rhambo, commander of the
sheriff's Compton substation, "I want you to stop those people
immediately from leaving City Hall. They may be stealing city
property. If they have left, I want you to stop them and take
possession of those papers."</TE>
<TE>   It is a scene that raises two questions: How much more drama can
this populace take? And what now for Compton?</TE>
<TE>   "Chaos," said Compton City Clerk Charles Davis. "You watch the
next three weeks."</TE>
<TE>   In a place like Compton, predicting the future can be dicey. But
events on- and off-camera in recent weeks provide clues to what may
be in store.</TE>
<TE>   Two things can be forecast. One is the likely appeal by ousted
Mayor Eric Perrodin, a deputy district attorney who, many legal
experts say, has a decent chance of prevailing on appeal</TE>
<TE>   Then there is the investigation by Dist. Atty. Steve Cooley, which
became public Sept. 19, when his investigators served search warrants
at Compton City Hall and the properties of several city leaders.</TE>
<TE>   Cooley called the court verdict "irrelevant to the aggressive,
ongoing investigation by this office's public integrity division over
allegations of public corruption in Compton."</TE>
<TE>   Who's Attending</TE>
<TE>   to City's Needs?</TE>
<TE>   All the hubbub has distracted attention from Compton's very
visible urban needs.</TE>
<TE>   Several business developers in the region say Compton's political
upheaval has discouraged business investment in the community.</TE>
<TE>   "As far as location, Compton is an ideal spot," said Jack Kyser,
chief economist with the Los Angeles Economic Development Corp. "And
if you go along the 91 [freeway] you see a lot of corporate
presence....But the uncertainty about who will be in charge tomorrow
may be a problem for business."</TE>
<TE>   Keeping track of events in the city can test even the most ardent
Compton political devotee--of which there are legions.</TE>
<TE>   For all the crime and scandal that gets reported, Compton does not
get credit for an exuberant engagement in city government.</TE>
<TE>   Residents knew of the court verdict in less than 30 minutes, and
were soon on the street cheering, carrying picket signs and getting
into debates on the City Hall steps.</TE>
<TE>   At the vortex of Compton's current storm was June's election.
Perrodin promised to clean up politics, yet he also was accused of
giving a two-fingered crude gesture to non-supporters on polling day.
Perrodin denied the two fingers, stating that he was fairly sure it
was just one finger.</TE>
<TE>   He won the mayoralty in a stunning upset of two-time incumbent
Bradley. Melanie Andrews was defeated by Leslie Irving for an open
council seat. Both races were close.</TE>
<TE>   Bradley sued the city, Perrodin and City Clerk Davis, alleging
election fraud. On Feb. 8, a Superior Court judge concluded that the
city clerk illegally put Perrodin's and Irving's names first on the
ballot--instead of a randomly selected order, as dictated by law. The
order gave them enough of an advantage to win the race, the judge
ruled.</TE>
<TE>   Coupled with testimony saying that votes were cast by nonresidents
and even a dead person--whose remains were carried in an urn to the
courtroom--the judge overturned the election. The judge also said
Councilwoman Irving, her parents and her sister committed election
fraud, and banned Irving from ever holding office in California.</TE>
<TE>   The verdict surprised many legal experts. Even Bradley's attorney
considered the odds against winning the case 99 to 1.</TE>
<TE>   Perrodin and his supporters expect Bradley to swiftly squeeze out
most of the city department heads, from city manager to fire
chief--at least those Perrodin hired in the seven months before he
was ousted.</TE>
<TE>   Personnel  Changes Ahead</TE>
<TE>   The first hint of more change came Feb. 12, when City Manager
Howard Caldwell offered his resignation. The council declined to
accept it that night, but most city observers expect him to be gone
soon.</TE>
<TE>   Another anticipated personnel change is the fire chief. Sources
said Perrodin's administration offered the job to an Alabama fire
official, who quit his job to take the post. The court's ruling came
before he started work, and the City Council is now expected to hire
someone else.</TE>
<TE>   This comes as welcome news to the Compton Fire Department, which
unabashedly backed Bradley.</TE>
<TE>   Management and the rank-and-file workers want the city to contract
service from the Los Angeles County Fire Department, which they would
like to join. Overhead costs would be cheaper, and several
firefighters said in interviews that such a change might get them an
added station and better benefits.</TE>
<TE>   On the day of the verdict, a fire engine drove by Bradley's house,
firefighters cheering and waving as they passed.</TE>
<TE>   In the hours after the startling court decision, Perrodin seemed
weary and even resigned to his fate.</TE>
<TE>   To a pastor who urged him to appeal, Perrodin shook his head. Even
if he were reinstated as mayor, he reasoned, the pro-Bradley majority
City Council might well hire Bradley as city manager.</TE>
<TE>   Aside from that potential civic nightmare, Perrodin added:
"There's another election in 18 months."</TE>
<TE>   But in character with the city's topsy-turvy political nature,
Perrodin changed his mind by nightfall, and vowed to appeal his
ouster.</TE>
<TE>   For the time being, Bradley is firmly back in his seat of power.</TE>
<TE>   The mood was giddy and theatrical last Tuesday afternoon as
Bradley and Andrews attended their first post-verdict City Council
meeting. They were met by an overflow crowd of perhaps several
hundred people. Some clearly had vested interests, such as the
firefighters. But there were others there as spectators.</TE>
<TE>   A mother of seven, who works full time, brought three of her
children.</TE>
<TE>   "Let's just see what happens, why don't we?" a woman with a silver
bun said with a wink, toting knitting needles to a seat.</TE>
<TE>   Apart from the celebratory nature of the event, it was distinctive
for a City Council meeting.</TE>
<TE>   For one, most cities don't have official emcees like Frank
Wheaton, a childhood friend of Bradley's who is expected to be
rehired in his old job of city spokesman.</TE>
<TE>   Bradley the Star of Council Meeting</TE>
<TE>   At the welcome-home council meeting, a five-hour valentine to
Bradley with a few commercial breaks for Andrews, Wheaton introduced
an array of people, dignitaries from neighboring cities, a raft of
clergy from throughout the city and the extensive families of various
council members.</TE>
<TE>   In the deep and modulated voice of broadcasters, he even
introduced other introducers.</TE>
<TE>   "And now, ladies and gentlemen," he would say, "without further
ado, let me introduce the lovely, Miss Melanie Andrews!" Virtually
every woman was described as a "lovely lady."</TE>
<TE>   Reflecting the meeting's mix of church fervor, solemnity and
humor, Councilman Amen Rahh called for the city's clergy to come
together on the dais for "some powerful prayer." He rhapsodized about
Andrews being like an African queen, and the judge's verdict "beyond
history.... She knew there was something funky in the house," he
said, to considerable laughter.</TE>
<TE>   All the council members promised to listen more, fight less, and
try to patch up the divides and wounds of the city.</TE>
<TE>   "I love you, Compton," Andrews said in closing.</TE>
<TE>   Bradley, in a voice worthy of a pulpit, cast himself as a
God-minded triumphant warrior, humbled by the second chance at the
mayor's office, eager to build community bridges.</TE>
<TE>   But just when it seemed the meeting would end in peace, and after
Rahh praised Bradley and urged him to change the minds of his
detractors, sounds of the preelection Bradley returned.</TE>
<TE>   "Some of you thought you knew," he said, speaking slowly and
carefully. "You" meant those he presumed to be political enemies,
such as City Clerk Davis.</TE>
<TE>   Promising to find those he thinks undermined last June's election,
he warned: "Everybody, you know who you are."</TE>
<TE>   Then someone shouted the name of the city clerk, who shouted back,
"What? Are you going to come surround me?"</TE>
<TE>   Davis stood up. Sheriff's deputies stood up. Some of the audience
stood up. After a few tense seconds, everybody sat down.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier in the meeting, Wheaton, the emcee, had observed that it
was time for the city to heal and, "We shall do so with peace, love
and honor."</TE>

<HD>Battle Shapes Up in Latino District</HD>
<DH>Politics: Primary poses a tight race for a seat that might
give Congress its first sister act.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD MAROSI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It is California's newest congressional district, an oddly shaped
swath of southeast Los Angeles County created to boost Latino clout
in Washington.</LD>
<LD>   And while little doubt exists that a Latino will win the House
seat in the mostly working-class district, the March 5 primary race
is a tight, three-way battle providing suspense in a season full of
yawners.</LD>
<LD>   The 39th Congressional District race has drawn national interest
as Orange County Rep. Loretta Sanchez (D-Santa Ana)--a proven
Democratic fund-raiser--throws her weight behind her sister, Linda, a
union official and attorney.</LD>
<TE>   Aiming to bust up what would be the first congressional sister
team in history are South Gate Councilman Hector De La Torre and
state Assemblywoman Sally Havice (D-Cerritos), both of whom have
drawn support from key Latino leaders.</TE>
<TE>   The campaign has turned nasty in recent weeks, with Linda Sanchez
criticized for receiving funds from a Playboy magazine executive,
Havice fending off accusations of being a tax scofflaw, and De La
Torre angrily countering charges that he is a product of South Gate's
raucous politics.</TE>
<TE>   Havice and De La Torre have demanded that Sanchez pull negative
cable ads that debuted earlier this month. The Sanchez campaign has
refused.</TE>
<TE>   "Hector has to get used to taking some of the heat," said Bill
Wachob, Sanchez's political consultant, in rejecting a written
request from De La Torre supporters to remove the ads.</TE>
<TE>   De La Torre and Havice say the personal attacks are a sign of
desperation by a candidate who has no experience in public office.</TE>
<TE>   "This is all a smoke screen on [Sanchez's] part to hide the fact
that she has no roots in the community and the plain fact that, if it
wasn't for her sister, she'd be a second- or third-tier candidate in
this race," De La Torre said.</TE>
<TE>   Most Latino leaders--local and national--are staying out of the
fray. Though they are split on endorsements, they appear unwilling to
spill political blood when a Latino Democrat is virtually assured of
winning in November.</TE>
<TE>   What's left is a race generating more personal animosity than
campaign funding or high-level intraparty squabbles.</TE>
<TE>   "More money is going to partisan battles," said Jaime Regalado,
executive director of the Edmund G. Brown Institute of Public Affairs
at Cal State L.A. "The feeling is that it's a Democratic lock, so
it's only a personality contest now."</TE>
<TE>   With California gaining a House seat last year, Democratic leaders
created the district to strengthen Latino representation in
Washington, where Latinos hold 12% of the state's House seats.</TE>
<TE>   The U-shaped district spans the spectrum of Latino demographics,
from the immigrant gateway neighborhoods of South Gate and Lynwood to
the suburban enclaves of Whittier and La Mirada, home to many
long-established Latinos.</TE>
<TE>   The district also includes the cities of Lakewood, Cerritos,
Artesia, and Hawaiian Gardens, which are home to many white and Asian
American voters.</TE>
<TE>   Vying in the Republican primary are Tim Escobar, a businessman,
and Richard Owens, an energy conversation consultant. But analysts
give the Republican winner little chance in November: Latinos
constitute 61% of the population and Democrats hold a 55% to 28% edge
over Republicans in registered voters.</TE>
<TE>   The Democratic primary race has drawn six contenders, with Havice,
Sanchez and De La Torre moving far ahead, according to polls.</TE>
<TE>   Others running for the seat are ABC school board member Cecy
Groom; Helen M. Rahder, a former Whittier City Council member; and
Ken Graham, a political science professor.</TE>
<TE>   Sanchez holds a big lead in raising funds, thanks in part to help
from her sister, who has been tapping her Washington connections.
Through the end of last year, Sanchez had raised $154,899 to De La
Torre's $69,336, according to the most recent campaign finance
information. Havice had raised $34,158.</TE>
<TE>   Big sister Loretta's help returns a favor to Linda, who as a
campaign worker helped Loretta first get elected to Congress in 1996,
and then reelected in 1998.</TE>
<TE>   The sixth of seven children born to immigrant parents, 32-year-old
Linda Sanchez worked as a civil rights attorney before taking her
current post as executive secretary-treasurer for the Orange County
Central Labor Council.</TE>
<TE>   If Linda Sanchez is elected, she and her sister would become the
first sisters to serve simultaneously in the House of
Representatives.</TE>
<TE>   Sanchez has received endorsements from women's groups and several
members of Congress, including Reps. Maxine Waters (D-Los Angeles)
and Nancy Pelosi (D-San Francisco). Loretta Sanchez often joins Linda
on door-to-door visits, lending her considerable clout to the
campaign.</TE>
<TE>   "I've burned a lot of shoe leather in her races," said Linda, "and
it's her turn now."</TE>
<TE>   One place Sanchez has been focusing attention is South Gate, the
district's biggest city and a De La Torre stronghold.</TE>
<TE>   De La Torre, 34, is one of four generations of De La Torres living
in the heavily Latino community. A former teacher, he worked several
years in Washington as a legislative aide and Labor Department
official.</TE>
<TE>   He moved back to South Gate in 1996, where he became a councilman,
and won reelection in a now-infamous race that included another
candidate named Hector De La Torre. The rival's campaign is
considered by many to have been an effort to confuse voters, and De
La Torre's large margin of victory signaled to many his growing
political clout.</TE>
<TE>   De La Torre, a father of three, touts his experience in Washington
and local politics. His backers include Reps. Hilda L. Solis (D-La
Puente) and Joe Baca (D-Rialto).</TE>
<TE>   In the only feud between Latino leaders to flare up in public,
Rep. Sanchez has said that Solis endorsed De La Torre to appease some
of her campaign contributors. Solis says she supports De La Torre
because he is the most qualified candidate.</TE>
<TE>   Like De La Torre, Havice is a survivor of many political battles.
She held back strong Republican challenges while twice being elected
to represent the 56th Assembly District, which includes Lakewood,
Cerritos and Artesia.</TE>
<TE>   A former English professor and a grandmother of nine, she has
focused on environmental and school safety issues. She boasts of her
legislative attendance record, saying she has been called the Cal
Ripken of the state Assembly.</TE>
<TE>   The Democratic candidates do not differ much on key national
issues. They back gun control and abortion rights, and list education
reform among their priorities.</TE>
<TE>   Without a hot-button issue to battle over, the campaign has
degenerated in recent weeks into personal attacks, most of them fired
from the Sanchez camp.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier this month the Sanchez campaign began running cable spots
criticizing Havice for allegedly not paying her homeowner's dues and
property taxes.</TE>
<TE>   Havice denied the accusations at a candidates' forum in Lakewood,
accusing Sanchez of running a "Newt Gingrich-style" campaign.</TE>
<TE>   Havice said she has always paid the dues and taxes, but that some
payments may have been late in the 25 years she has lived in her
Cerritos home.</TE>
<TE>   "Late doesn't mean you don't pay," said Havice, who said the
negative campaigning will backfire on Sanchez.</TE>
<TE>   "People in this area are smart enough to figure it out," Havice
said. "They're not going to be fooled."</TE>
<TE>   Sanchez also attacked De La Torre in an ad suggesting that the
councilman is corrupt because he received money during a city
campaign from a trash hauler that underpaid the city $1.5 million in
franchise fees.</TE>
<TE>   But De La Torre said he voted against extending the firm's
contract, evidence that he provided no favors. His record is so
clean, he said, that his last campaign featured an endorsement from
Loretta Sanchez.</TE>
<TE>   "If I'm so corrupt, why did [Linda's] sister endorse me?" he
asked.</TE>
<TE>   The Sanchez ad seems aimed at lumping De La Torre in with several
ongoing criminal corruption probes in the city. De La Torre, in fact,
has been commended by prosecutors as a corruption fighter.</TE>
<TE>   Sanchez stands by the ad, saying that De La Torre's actions in his
last campaign raise questions about his ethics.</TE>
<TE>   Nasty campaigning aside, the heated race is seen as a good thing
by observers of Latino politics.</TE>
<TE>   Many see it as a sign of an evolving political maturity, pitting
several real contenders instead of candidates handpicked by a small
group of elected leaders and political insiders.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a step toward maturity," said Fernando Guerra, a Loyola
Marymount University professor.</TE>
<TE>   "One measure of political growth is that you have a fairly healthy
competition and the leaders in the Latino community are not lock,
stock and barrel behind any one of them."</TE>

<HD>An Environmental Feud at the End of the Trail in Norco</HD>
<DH>Pollution: Residents in new development sue neighbor, a
longtime firm that uses explosives in testing.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SCOTT GOLD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In western Riverside County, the rolling hills and the tumbleweeds
act as a fortress of sorts--an ideal setting for discreet weapons
tests or earthquake simulations, and ideal for homeowners looking for
a little elbow room.</LD>
<LD>   But it seems Norco isn't big enough for both. Dozens of families
who bought homes in two tony new neighborhoods are alleging that the
high-tech engineering firm Wyle Laboratories is not the neighbor they
thought it was when they moved in.</LD>
<LD>   They charge in a lawsuit that the developers of two communities,
Stoneridge Estates and Hidden Valley, did not adequately disclose the
types of business Wyle conducts in Norco. Residents say that business
has polluted their neighborhoods. Some want the area cleaned up.
Others want their money back.</LD>
<TE>   Wyle, based in El Segundo, specializes in testing and evaluating
tools and equipment under environmental stress. The company, which is
not a defendant in the lawsuit, acknowledged using some toxic
chemicals over the years but denied that any resulting contamination
is dangerous to residents.</TE>
<TE>   Local residents are abuzz with these discoveries:</TE>
<TE>   * Ground water on Wyle's 450-acre site, near the crook of
Interstates 15 and 91, contains trichloroethylene, a carcinogen, at
levels 128 times higher than the state's limit for drinking water,
according to the Regional Water Quality Control Board. The chemical,
often used to remove grease from metal and to clean liquid oxygen and
hydrogen tanks, can cause respiratory problems and headaches, and has
produced liver tumors in mice.</TE>
<TE>   * The California Department of Toxic Substance Control confirmed
last week that it is investigating whether there are unusually high
levels of lead on Wyle's site. One sample, taken late last year,
suggests that the lead may have been left behind by a detonation,
according to a government document.</TE>
<TE>   Studies have shown that children who swallow lead can suffer brain
damage, muscle weakness, kidney damage, hyperactivity and other
problems. In adults, exposure has been linked to high blood pressure,
strokes and nerve damage.</TE>
<TE>   * Riverside County health officials have reported that they found
hydrazine, a rocket fuel once used in Wyle's tests, in two wells.
County inspectors also discovered faulty chemical inventory records
at Wyle and incomplete training documents.</TE>
<TE>   Lisa Blake and her husband live with their three children in a
$300,000 house they bought in March. Her 12-year-old son and his
friends played frequently in a nearby pond. Blake fears that
contaminated ground water might have found its way into the pond.</TE>
<TE>   "Never in a million years did it enter my mind that the water that
drained into that pond would have filtered through a property that
had contaminated water, and that they would be standing in it," Blake
said. "What incenses me is that there are people that should know
better, knowing that families were going to be moving in around
them."</TE>
<TE>   The situation has elicited inevitable comparisons to the dispute
over chromium 6 that leaked into ground water near Pacific Gas &amp;
Electric Co.'s Hinkley site--and spawned the environmental campaign
depicted in the film "Erin Brockovich."</TE>
<TE>   But Wyle and the developers scoffed at the comparisons--largely
because the contamination found on Wyle's property does not approach
the levels of toxic waste in Hinkley, a desert town near Barstow.
They said Wyle has been on the site for 45 years and has never hidden
what it does.</TE>
<TE>   Company Says Homes, Families Are Safe</TE>
<TE>   Moving next door and then complaining about Wyle's operations,
they said, is akin to moving into a home under the flight path of Los
Angeles International Airport, then complaining about the noise from
passing jets.</TE>
<TE>   "The homes are safe. The families are safe. And the property is
safe," said Scott Jones, a spokesman for the Inland Empire division
of Centex Homes, one of the nation's largest home builders and the
developer of an 82-home site near Wyle.</TE>
<TE>   Jones said Centex has hired an environmental consulting firm to
perform additional tests in the area "to resolve the issues once and
for all."</TE>
<TE>   "It's a top priority," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The other developer, Western Pacific Housing, did not return phone
calls seeking comment.</TE>
<TE>   The environmental regulators who have discovered the pollution
said the incipient battle over the Norco property is not of the
proportion of Hinkley.</TE>
<TE>   There is no evidence, said Kurt Berchtold, assistant executive
officer of the Regional Water Quality Control Board in Riverside,
that any contamination has infiltrated the residents' drinking water.
And there is no evidence that any contamination has put residents in
danger, regulators said.</TE>
<TE>   "Our inspections reveal some violations, but nothing really,
really significant," said Earl Tuntland, assistant environmental
health administrator for the Riverside County Department of
Environmental Health. "And they [Wyle] have worked with us to make
corrections. We're pretty happy."</TE>
<TE>   The lawsuit, filed in Riverside County Superior Court, does not
charge that Wyle Laboratories has polluted the plaintiffs' property
but focuses instead on the disclosure issue. California law requires
that anyone selling property disclose information that could affect
the property's value and desirability.</TE>
<TE>   LeRae Spera and her husband spent $376,000 on a large, new home in
Stoneridge Estates, a development just east and south of the Wyle
property, in March. Three months later, Spera was in City Hall,
researching the area, when she overheard two city officials talking.
One official said he thought Norco should buy the Wyle property and
turn it into an area for parks and trails, Spera said.</TE>
<TE>   "The other person said, 'That would not be a good idea because of
the contamination. That would be crazy.' I thought: What
contamination? I just couldn't believe what he had said," said Spera,
who has helped galvanize neighbors in a grass-roots campaign for
information.</TE>
<TE>   "Had I known all of this, would I have wanted to live there? No,
probably not," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Wyle's niche emerged after World War II, when studies showed that
some equipment failed because the military did not understand how it
would perform in different environments.</TE>
<TE>   Wyle can simulate huge dust storms on its site. It can conduct,
and has conducted, tests to ensure that a valve needed to shut down a
nuclear power plant will still operate after an earthquake, said
Drexel Smith, Wyle's senior vice president and general manager.</TE>
<TE>   Some Tests Use Explosives, Lawyer Says</TE>
<TE>   Residents said they were not warned that some of those tests
involve toxic chemicals. Their attorney, Tony Lanza, a founding
partner of the Irvine law firm Lanza &amp; Goolsby, said they did not
know that Wyle periodically blows things up during tests. The lawsuit
accuses the developers of intentionally misspelling "Wyle" on
disclosure forms to keep residents from researching the firm.</TE>
<TE>   Developers denied that charge, and Smith pointed out that two
80-foot water towers on the site advertise the firm in giant block
letters--"WYLE"--that are clearly visible from surrounding streets.</TE>
<TE>   "The obligation is there to disclose these types of facts," Lanza
said.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know that Wyle is actually hazardous to these people's
health. We don't know that, and we don't allege that. What we're
saying is that the buyers, when they plunk down a half-million
dollars for a piece of property, they have the right to know and make
their own decision."</TE>

<HD>Medi-Cal Proposes to Aid Sex Partners</HD>
<DH>Health: Campaign against chlamydia infection allows doctors
to forgo exams, prescribe drugs. State seeks federal approval of
payment.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHARLES ORNSTEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>State health officials are seeking to squelch a dramatic rise in
chlamydia infections by expanding the role of public health insurance
and altering the doctor-patient relationship.</LD>
<LD>   The Medi-Cal program is proposing to pay for drugs to treat the
sexual partners of beneficiaries infected with chlamydia, one of the
most common sexually transmitted diseases. Medi-Cal, which serves
California's poor and disabled, has never before paid for any
treatment of non-beneficiaries.</LD>
<LD>   The move follows passage of a state law allowing doctors to
prescribe medication to the sexual partners of chlamydia patients,
even if physicians have never met the partners and do not know their
identities. Normally, doctors must conduct a good-faith examination
of patients before prescribing medications.</LD>
<TE>   Experts say the state's actions are necessary because current
public health measures have proved inadequate to contain chlamydia.</TE>
<TE>   Preliminary data for 2001 suggest that reported infections topped
100,000 for the first time, up by nearly two-thirds in five years.
Some of the recent increase may result from more screening, although
one expert said the estimates are too low.</TE>
<TE>   Chlamydia patients often display no symptoms, and the actual toll
of new infections in the state probably reaches 300,000 to 600,000
each year, said Dr. Gail Bolan, chief of the sexually transmitted
disease control branch at the California Department of Health
Services.</TE>
<TE>   Women Face Worse Health Consequences</TE>
<TE>   The new approach is aimed primarily at preventing reinfection in
women, since they face worse health consequences from chlamydia,
including possible infertility, scarring and ectopic pregnancies.
Also, the disease is most common in girls 15 to 19 years old,
followed by women ages 20 to 24, and Medi-Cal covers far more women
than men.</TE>
<TE>   If doctors treat only an infected woman--and not her sexual
partners--she has a 15% to 30% chance of becoming reinfected with the
disease within six months.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a big deal," said Dr. George Rutherford, a professor of
preventive medicine and epidemiology at UC San Francisco. Treating
partners "is an absolutely necessary piece of the armamentarium in
this disease control program."</TE>
<TE>   Bolan agreed: "If you don't take care of the partner, then you
haven't taken care of your patient."</TE>
<TE>   Before the state law took effect, doctors could have been
penalized by the state medical board if they prescribed a drug to a
patient without a good-faith examination.</TE>
<TE>   While some doctors quietly risked sanction, most simply advised
infected patients to have their sexual partners seek testing and
treatment. Even now, many officials prefer that to giving drugs to
patients for their partners. Treatment usually consists of a single
dose of Azithromycin, a common antibiotic.</TE>
<TE>   The partner treatment law, which took effect last year, had
widespread support from the medical community, in part because a
single dose of antibiotics is not considered risky and is difficult
to abuse.</TE>
<TE>   But some local health officials say they are not rushing to give
prescriptions to sexual partners they haven't examined. The Los
Angeles County Department of Health Services, for instance, wants to
study the program in a couple of clinics before it implements it in
all county facilities.</TE>
<TE>   One trial headed by the federal Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention found that reinfection rates appeared to be lower among
women who gave medications to their partners, compared to women who
advised their partners to visit a physician.</TE>
<TE>   But the researchers said that the study wasn't conclusive.</TE>
<TE>   $75,000 Grant Allows Broader Evaluation</TE>
<TE>   Dr. Peter Kerndt, who heads Los Angeles County's sexually
transmitted disease control program, said his office has received a
$75,000 grant to study the approach further.</TE>
<TE>   "If we can show that it will be cost-effective in public clinics,
it will be a lot easier for it to be made policy," Kerndt said. "This
is the time to do evaluation if you're going to do it at all."</TE>
<TE>   The San Francisco Department of Public Health began providing
medication for sexual partners in December 1998, well before the
state law was discussed. By declaring a local health emergency,
officials were allowed to provide drugs for a range of sexually
transmitted diseases without a patient exam.</TE>
<TE>   Since then, city STD clinics have given out 517 doses to partners
of chlamydia patients, or about 15 doses a month, and 964 for
gonorrhea, said Dr. Jeffrey Klausner, San Francisco's STD control
officer. A city survey found that 70% of patients gave the medicine
to their partners.</TE>
<TE>   The state spent the past year researching whether it could use
Medi-Cal funds to pay for partner treatments. Because Medi-Cal is
jointly funded by the state and federal governments, its decision is
subject to approval by the U.S. Department of Health and Human
Services.</TE>
<TE>   A federal health official said the state's request, the first of
its kind in the nation, is under review. Historically, the federal
Medicaid program--of which Medi-Cal is a part--allows services to be
provided to eligible members only.</TE>
<TE>   Federal officials could require the state to submit a formal
application, which could result in delays. If the request is denied,
the state would have to seek alternative funding.</TE>
<TE>   In the private sector, health maintenance organizations have
adopted various stances on paying for treatment of nonmembers.</TE>
<TE>   The San Francisco Health Plan, whose 40,000 clients have low
incomes, began paying for drugs for members' sexual partners last
year, said medical director Dr. Karen Smith.</TE>
<TE>   For Doctors, New Law Was 'a Wake-Up Call'</TE>
<TE>   Until now, doctors "really weren't listening about this epidemic,"
Smith said. But once the law passed, "a lot of doctors' heads turned.
It was a wake-up call."</TE>
<TE>   But Health Net of California, among others, has no plans to pay
for drugs for nonmembers, said senior medical director Dr. Mark
Finch. The HMO did, however, support the law and has sent educational
materials about chlamydia to doctors and patients.</TE>
<TE>   "We certainly do not discourage the issuing of a prescription for
a partner of a Health Net member by the physician," Finch said. "On
the other hand, we don't reimburse the partner for that."</TE>
<TE>   Lawmakers in some other states are watching California's efforts
closely. In Wisconsin, state Rep. Sheldon Wasserman hopes to revive
the issue there after a similar treatment bill that he introduced
died two years ago.</TE>
<TE>   "Unfortunately, some of my colleagues in the Legislature are not
as forward-thinking," said Wasserman, a Democrat and
obstetrician-gynecologist. "Just to say that California has passed it
looks good, because we're not the first in the nation to do this.
Having you guys pass it is helping my cause.... "</TE>
<TE>(BEGIN TEXT OF INFOBOX)</TE>
<TE>Chlamydia is the most frequently reported sexually transmitted
disease in the state and nation.</TE>
<TE>Up to 40% of women with untreated chlamydia can develop pelvic
inflammatory disease, which can cause infertility, chronic
pelvic pain and ectopic pregnancies.</TE>
<TE>Three-quarters of women and 50% of men have no symptoms.</TE>
<TE>Symptoms in women can include vaginal discharge, lower abdominal
pain and a burning sensation during urination. In men, they
include urethral discharge, painful urination, and irritation
around the opening of the penis.</TE>
<TE>The chart below shows reported cases of chlamydia in recent years.
Experts believe the actual number of new infections is much higher
than those reported--up to 600,000 per year in California and 4
million nationally.</TE>

<HD>Outspoken Supervisor Spitzer May Have Ticket to Sacramento</HD>
<DH>Politics: Pro-Great Park Republican unopposed March 5. In
fall, he faces Democrat Bea Foster.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAN WEIKEL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It's hard to miss Orange County Supervisor Todd Spitzer on the
political landscape. He's the youthful, hard-wired policy wonk who
gestures with his hands, shifts in his seat and exercises an almost
compulsive urge to say what he thinks.</LD>
<LD>   For six years, Spitzer has rattled the county Hall of
Administration, clashing with department heads and tackling some of
the region's more difficult and controversial issues. Now, he wants
to take his boyish enthusiasm and aggressive leadership to
Sacramento.</LD>
<LD>   After a decade in local elected offices, Spitzer is running for
the 71st Assembly District seat being vacated by Bill Campbell,
R-Villa Park.</LD>
<TE>   Spitzer, 41, is unopposed in the Republican primary on March 5 and
is expected to face Democrat Bea Foster in the November general
election. Foster, a Santa Ana schoolteacher who is also unopposed,
has been defeated regularly by Republican opponents for a variety of
offices.</TE>
<TE>   Although Spitzer said he does not want to take anything for
granted, political consultants believe he is the likely winner,
considering the district is 54.8% Republican.</TE>
<TE>   Campbell, who can't run again because of term limits, handily
defeated Foster, 70% to 30%, in his last campaign.</TE>
<TE>   If elected, Spitzer said he would support traditional Republican
positions to fight taxes, cut bureaucratic waste, promote business
and champion law-enforcement causes.</TE>
<TE>   He dislikes that residents of Orange and Riverside counties often
send Sacramento more in taxes than they get back.</TE>
<TE>   But Spitzer differs from his more conservative colleagues on some
of the GOP's hot-button issues.</TE>
<TE>   He is not a fan of school vouchers and believes public education
can be improved without them. Though he is personally against
abortion, he said he would not introduce or support legislation to
limit a woman's right to choose.</TE>
<TE>   ''I want to be in the Legislature to solve problems, not carry an
ideological torch,'' said Spitzer, who has aspired to hold state
office since college when he was a Senate intern.</TE>
<TE>   The district he would like to represent stretches from San Juan
Capistrano in south Orange County to Norco in Riverside County. About
425,000 people live within its borders, which were redrawn in
September to include both counties.</TE>
<TE>   As of Feb. 6, Spitzer had raised about $497,000 in campaign
contributions from attorneys, developers, business owners,
executives, law-enforcement groups and political-action committees.</TE>
<TE>   He is endorsed by Orange County Supervisor Tom Wilson, Orange
County Sheriff Mike Carona, the Assn. of Orange County Deputy
Sheriffs, and the Orange County Professional Firefighters Assn. His
statewide endorsements include those of the California Correctional
Officers Assn. and the California Federation of Teachers.</TE>
<TE>   Elected state and local officials note that no Republican or
Democrat has emerged from Riverside County to challenge Spitzer.
Jeffrey Bennett, a wealthy businessman and Corona City Council
member, had considered entering the race but bowed out.</TE>
<TE>   ''That Spitzer is unopposed speaks well of him,'' said
Assemblywoman Lynn Daucher, R-Brea. ''People at first thought there
would be a battle over who would run, but he has managed to gain the
confidence of those who might challenge him from Riverside.''</TE>
<TE>   Still, Spitzer is not without detractors. Orange County Treasurer
John M.W. Moorlach, for instance, said the supervisor's political
gusto left him cold last year when Spitzer criticized Moorlach's
office for investing in Edison International stock as the energy
crisis was building. "He enjoys getting press," Moorlach said, "and
some of the things he does are more motivated by a desire for
attention than getting anything done."</TE>
<TE>   Spitzer said the county treasurer was not supervising the daily
trades of his office. Some Edison stock was bought when it was on
credit watch because of increasing risk. Spitzer said the Board of
Supervisors tightened the treasurer's procedures.</TE>
<TE>   Others say Spitzer sometimes speaks before he thinks. He recently
retracted a strongly worded condemnation of investors who bought San
Joaquin Hills toll road bonds. Motorists, he meant to say, may have
to take priority over Wall Street when it comes time to consider toll
increases again.</TE>
<TE>   His initial remarks alarmed turnpike officials and ratings
analysts, who have become concerned about the San Joaquin Hills'
declining financial condition. The supervisor, who sits on the
highway's board of directors, admits he got some heat over his
comments.</TE>
<TE>   Spitzer lives in Orange with his wife, Jamie, and 3-year-old son,
Justin. He is a former Orange County deputy district attorney and was
a reserve Los Angeles police officer for 10 years. He taught English
at Roosevelt High School in East Los Angeles for two years before
becoming an attorney.</TE>
<TE>   His first venture into public office was a four-year stint on the
board of the Brea Olinda Unified School District. During his tenure,
Spitzer exposed a grade-changing scandal that involved district
administrators.</TE>
<TE>   He was elected to the Orange County Board of Supervisors in 1996,
defeating former Assemblyman Mickey Conroy, whom he taunted during
the campaign by calling him ''a sexual harasser.'' Conroy, who was
reprimanded in 1994 for violating the Assembly's sexual harassment
policy, chafed under Spitzer's attacks, finally displaying a profane
gesture at the young challenger during a public appearance.</TE>
<TE>   Within a year of taking office, it became clear that Spitzer, an
aggressive and vocal leader known for his prosecutorial style, would
not lapse into the staid demeanor displayed by many previous board
members.</TE>
<TE>   He took aim at then-county Chief Executive Officer Jan
Mittermeier, accusing her of lying to keep supervisors in the dark
about shoddy work performed for a county housing program.</TE>
<TE>   A month later, Spitzer castigated his former boss, Dist. Atty.
Michael R. Capizzi, for failing to use money from a reserve fund to
boost the office's sagging child-support collections.</TE>
<TE>   His outspokenness prompted then-board-colleague William Steiner to
quip that Spitzer's motto was, ''Ready, fire, aim.''</TE>
<TE>   ''If people weren't happy with me,'' Spitzer said recently, ''it
is because I told them to do their jobs. Department heads are highly
paid. They have a lot of power. I expect them to be responsible.''</TE>
<TE>   Since his reelection in 2000, Spitzer has concentrated on the
drive to derail a commercial airport at the former El Toro Marine
Corps Air Station. He is co-chairman of Measure W, a March ballot
measure calling for a huge urban park to be built at the site.</TE>
<TE>   Spitzer also is behind Measure V, which would allow voters to fill
vacant seats on the county Board of Supervisors, rather than have the
governor, now a Democrat, appoint someone.</TE>
<TE>   As board chairman for the Orange County Transportation Authority,
Spitzer has concentrated on transportation problems shared by
Riverside and Orange counties. He has called for OCTA to buy the
controversial 91 Express Lanes, a private tollway on the congested
Riverside Freeway. Critics contend the road is a monopoly that will
do little to relieve future congestion on the freeway, , one of the
busiest in Southern California. Spitzer has called the tollway ''a
bad neighbor'' and ''a failed experiment'' in a county that has
supported the construction of toll roads and privatization of
government services.</TE>
<TE>   Looking back, Spitzer acknowledged that he has made mistakes in
office. ''I was too young,'' he said. ''I saw things too much in
black and white, and I was too self-righteous. But I think I have
gotten a lot of this stuff out of my system.''</TE>
<TE>   Spitzer said his toughest problems might not be in Sacramento if
he is elected, but in the Riverside portion of the district, where he
said voters might be distrustful of Orange County politicians.</TE>
<TE>   But members of the Riverside County Board of Supervisors, such as
John Tavaglione, Tom Mullen and Bob Buster, credit Spitzer with
moving the dialogue forward on transportation problems that affect
both counties, such as the Riverside Freeway, the main link between
the two.</TE>
<TE>   Differences exist over possible solutions. Nevertheless, they
praised Spitzer's willingness to cross the county line to talk about
the 91 Express Lanes or entertain debate on whether a highway should
be built through the Cleveland National Forest.</TE>
<TE>   ''He seems to be a bright, energetic young man,'' Buster said.
''It's been awhile since an Orange County supervisor has come over
here. He's willing to get out and mix it up."</TE>
<TE>   There is also the question of how well Spitzer might fit into the
Assembly's Republican caucus, a conservative lot that generally moves
as a unified bloc against the Democratic majority.</TE>
<TE>   Spitzer has a reputation for independence and for being a
problem-solver. But things can be harder to get done on the state
level, where legislators can be partisan and where there are more
people to persuade than in local government.</TE>
<TE>   ''He is aggressive, energetic and motivated,'' said a former
political consultant in Orange County, who requested anonymity.
''Spitzer is the kind of guy who will want to work both sides of the
aisle to get things done. He is more into policy than politics.''</TE>

<HD>They Watch Birds Like a Hawk</HD>
<DH>Nature: Orange County volunteers keep track of flying
things as part of the annual Great Backyard Bird Count.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRISTINE HANLEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Birds of many stripes are dipping and diving gracefully over Nancy
Kenyon's backyard in a splendid ballet on a sunny Monday afternoon,
filling the air with sweet music and coming and going in dizzying
bursts.</LD>
<LD>   Kenyon, an ardent bird watcher who can identify a species by sight
or sound, has been keeping close track of the feathered friends who
regularly flock to her garden to munch on thistle seed, sunflower, or
freeze-dried mealworms--a special treat.</LD>
<LD>   Kenyon, of Irvine, is among thousands of hobbyists with varying
degrees of expertise who participated in this year's Great Backyard
Bird Count, a joint national project of the Audubon Society and the
Cornell University Lab of Ornithology.</LD>
<TE>   The count, in its fifth year, is not designed to be a perfect
measure of migratory trends but rather is used to develop state and
regional snapshots that help monitor bird populations and identify
local phenomena or anomalies that signal the need for further study.</TE>
<TE>   Volunteers are asked to log the bird traffic as it moves through
their backyards and post their findings on the Internet, at
www.birdsource.org. The Web site keeps a running tally of the
results.</TE>
<TE>   As of Monday, the fourth and final day of the count, more than
25,000 checklists had been turned in, showing that 2.7-million birds
and 463 species had been counted across North America.</TE>
<TE>   California trailed only New York in participation, with 1,769 bird
watchers weighing in. The top five species observed in the state were
the mourning dove, the house finch, Western scrub jay, Anna's
hummingbird and American robin.</TE>
<TE>   Kenyon, 63, has been a serious bird watcher for 20 years. She is
an Audubon member and a volunteer for the society's Project Feeder
Watch, another counting program that requires weekly reports of the
birds that descend into her backyard.</TE>
<TE>   Sitting outside with binoculars and a notebook, Kenyon hears the
warble of the red-breasted house finch and the quicker chirp of the
house sparrow before they land in her garden. An Anna's hummingbird,
a mockingbird, two mourning doves, white-crowned sparrows and
American gold finches also will arrive before the hour passes.</TE>
<TE>   Here, eight bird feeders stand amid a variety of native plants
that create a sanctuary of sorts, protecting the feathered creatures
from hawks and other natural foes.</TE>
<TE>   In Laguna Woods, 72-year-old Ellen Lamb is coming up with a
different count: So far today, she has counted, among other species,
30 cedar waxwings, 18 yellow-rumped warblers, seven crows, seven
bushtits, two hummingbirds, two bluebirds and two starlings.</TE>
<TE>   Both women say they first fell in love with bird-watching when
they were little girls. Kenyon had a front-row seat from her
breakfast table in Laguna Beach, where her dad built a feeder under
the kitchen windowsill. Lamb, who grew up in Rochester, N.Y., recalls
watching from her bedroom as brilliant warblers flew by and perched
on the giant cherry tree outside her window.</TE>
<TE>   Aside from their own enjoyment, Kenyon and Lamb feel as if they
are helping an important cause.</TE>
<TE>   "It's fun to watch birds," Kenyon said. "But I'm not interested in
just getting people to look at birds. I think that if you have a
greater appreciation for birds, you will have a greater appreciation
for nature, and you'll be more concerned about saving habitats."</TE>

<HD>Store Owner's Lucky Homecoming</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SEEMA MEHTA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Convenience-store owner Harry Bisla spent the weekend in Las Vegas
celebrating his son's birthday, but he isn't a gambling man and
didn't bet a dime. But when the 61-year-old Orange resident returned
home Sunday evening, he learned he had made a tidy sum all the same.</LD>
<LD>   A message on the answering machine from the manager of Bisla's
7-Eleven store in Orange said one of three winning lottery tickets
for California's record-breaking $193-million jackpot had been sold
there. Each ticket, bearing the numbers 6, 11, 31, 32 and 39 and the
mega number 20, is worth $64.3 million. And each retailer will
receive one-half of 1% of the jackpot share, or about $321,666.</LD>
<LD>   A little more than half of the money will go to the store's parent
company.</LD>
<TE>   Bisla, busy at work Monday at another 7-Eleven franchise he owns
in Huntington Beach, said he hasn't decided what to do with the
remainder.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know yet. I haven't thought about that yet," he said.
"I'm just trying to get a lot of paperwork done. I've been away for
three days."</TE>
<TE>   The holder of the winning ticket sold at Bisla's 7-Eleven and of
one sold in Montebello remained unknown Monday evening.</TE>
<TE>   According to the Associated Press, a regular customer at an
Albertson's in Half Moon Bay, Andy Kampe, said he was one of the
winners of Saturday's drawing, had his ticket validated and picked up
claim forms.</TE>
<TE>   Attempts to reach lottery officials were unsuccessful Monday.
Because lottery offices were closed Monday for Presidents Day,
winners would have to wait until today to present their tickets and
claim their prizes.</TE>
<TE>   Bisla said he spent part of Monday at the Orange store, along with
a crush of media and curious bystanders, in hopes of learning who the
lucky winner is. "A lot of people are still there," he said. "But I
gave up."</TE>

<HD>Politically Connected Horseman Wins Contract for El Toro
Stables</HD>
<DH>Supervisors: Western Heritage is chosen to run the
facility. Staff had backed O.C. Fair.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID REYES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When Orange County supervisors approved a politically connected
horseman's bid to run El Toro Stables, they overruled their staff's
choice of another bidder--and chose a winner who has been criticized
for his management of a similar facility in the Los Angeles area.</LD>
<LD>   Two bidders--the Orange County Fair and the Western Heritage
Assn., a San Juan Capistrano-based nonprofit headed by Jerry
Harris--competed to run the 150-horse stables at the closed El Toro
Marine base.</LD>
<LD>   An evaluation panel examined both proposals, looking at assets,
experience and income projections. The panel decided the fair's bid
was more qualified, citing its financial stability.</LD>
<TE>   County staff accepted the findings and recommended that the Board
of Supervisors approve the fair's bid. But when the vote came before
the supervisors last month, they chose Harris to run the 60-acre
stables.</TE>
<TE>   The vote came as a surprise to many who thought Harris' bid was
going nowhere because it was up against the formidable fair. Harris
proposed cleaning up the corrals and stalls, installing an irrigation
system and starting equestrian programs under the umbrella of Western
Heritage, a largely dormant nonprofit with few assets.</TE>
<TE>   By contrast, a proposal submitted by the fair, a state agency,
highlighted the fair's strengths, its 110-year history, its hefty
assets. As its chief spokesman, the fair had Curt Pringle, a former
Assembly speaker, prominent Republican, lobbyist and the fair board's
president.</TE>
<TE>   But Harris had a formidable lobbyist of his own: former Orange
County Sheriff Brad Gates, himself an equestrian and the chairman of
Western Heritage's board of directors. When he appeared before the
Board of Supervisors last month to plead Harris' cause, he proved an
effective advocate. Supervisors approved Harris' bid, 4-0, with board
Chairwoman Cynthia P. Coad abstaining.</TE>
<TE>   "Brad Gates and Jerry Harris are wonderful people," Coad said. "I
have no qualms about their ability as horse people and trainers and
so forth. But the vote was unclear and I was concerned with the
board's lack of following the procurement process, which had
recommended the fair."</TE>
<TE>   Controversial Awarding of Taxi Contract</TE>
<TE>   The county's procurement process has been scrutinized ever since
supervisors approved a start-up firm co-owned by one of the county's
prominent lobbyists to handle the taxi contract at John Wayne
Airport. The company later filed for bankruptcy, forcing the county
to scramble for taxi service at the airport.</TE>
<TE>   While some think board politics swung in favor of Harris and
Gates, Supervisor Chuck Smith said he was swayed by economics.</TE>
<TE>   "Very simply, the difference in bids was money," Smith said.
"[Heritage] was going to pay us nearly $50,000 a year. But the fair
board projected operating at a loss in the first year, though they
were going to make improvements at the stables." Harris' bid for a
three-year lease includes minimal improvements to the facility in the
first year.</TE>
<TE>   The county has a contract to lease the base from the Navy through
2005. A majority of the supervisors have said they may not subsidize
recreational activities like the equestrian center at the site after
that, especially if they lose money. Last year, the stables lost
$105,000.</TE>
<TE>   Across the county, horse owners are feeling similar pressures from
other landlords eager to turn their boarding stables into more
lucrative enterprises. River Trails in Orange is the most recent
stable to receive its eviction notice.</TE>
<TE>   The number of Orange County boarding stables has dwindled to 18.
Those stables house about 3,600 horses, but most facilities have long
waiting lists.</TE>
<TE>   El Toro Stables, built by the military, has deteriorated over the
years from lack of maintenance. Paint is peeling from some stalls,
floors are uneven, the arenas need repair, and junk and debris are
scattered on the property.</TE>
<TE>   Before the base's closure, the military stopped maintenance. Then,
when the county took over in 1997, it invoked numerous restrictions
because of asbestos in buildings and soil contaminated by hazardous
solvents used as engine degreasers and poured into the ground for
decades.</TE>
<TE>   "We haven't had a lot of support for a lot of years," said Star
Lewis, who has boarded horses at the former base for more than two
decades. "The county would not allow us to fill in [holes in the
stalls and paddocks] with dirt taken from a nearby field because of
contamination fears, even though we've been doing it for years."</TE>
<TE>   Of the $7 million in yearly rent the county pays for the base,
about $3.5 million comes from its general fund, said Supervisor Tom
Wilson. In its bid, "The fair board wanted to operate in the red ...
and as a businessman that bothered me."</TE>
<TE>   Officials with the fair proposed making a one-time payment of
$5,000 for yearly rent and estimated expenses of about $918,000. They
would have added stalls, improved lighting, added three acres of
event parking and created a mini-farm with community programs. But
the fair estimated it would operate about $284,800 in the red in the
first year.</TE>
<TE>   By contrast, Western Heritage proposed paying at least $36,000 in
yearly rent or 8% of annual profits, whichever was greater, and
projected a net income of $107,530.</TE>
<TE>   Harris' plan is to build more stables, provide clean stalls and
have improved riding arenas, where major horse shows and events could
be held.</TE>
<TE>   With more clients to serve and greater visibility among
equestrians in the county, Western Heritage could then generate
enough income to operate in the black.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, Harris said he plans to reinvest a portion of that
income back in the operation.</TE>
<TE>   A Long History of Equestrian Endeavors</TE>
<TE>   Harris, 53, has long years of experience in equestrian operations.
He has been involved in rodeos, horse shows and other equestrian
activities for more than two decades.</TE>
<TE>   A former San Juan Capistrano councilman, he developed Rancho
Sierra Vista stables in San Juan Capistrano with his then-wife into a
successful 400-horse enterprise. When they divorced several years
ago, she took control of the equestrian center.</TE>
<TE>   For more than two years, he has run the stables at Will Rogers
State Park in Pacific Palisades. But equestrian activities were
suspended there after state park officials tried to evict the horses
to halt "continuing environmental damage"; horse owners have filed
suit to stop the eviction. Harris continues to hold the lease on
those facilities.</TE>
<TE>   Criticism From a State Audit</TE>
<TE>   The controversy at Will Rogers was due in part to the unhappiness
of preservationists and descendants of Will Rogers over the state's
management of the 180-acre park.</TE>
<TE>   According to a state audit, some of Harris' projects at Will
Rogers lacked a written plan, budget or written state approval. In
addition, Harris installed permanent improvements without approval.</TE>
<TE>   The audit concluded that Harris was not in compliance with terms
of the lease--an allegation rejected by Harris, who says he was
unfairly targeted by equestrian opponents. He also noted that the
audit concluded that the state was out of compliance with the park's
General Plan.</TE>
<TE>   "This whole thing concerned one of the Rogers family [members who
was] complaining about conditions with the barn and boarding of
private horses there," Harris said. "The horses became a scapegoat
and I'm in the middle because I was the contractor. It wasn't my
responsibility to fix the things I didn't damage."</TE>
<TE>   Rogers' descendants could not be reached for comment. But in the
past, they and preservationists have criticized the boarding of
privately owned horses at the park, including those owned by Maria
Shriver and Arnold Schwarzenegger, as well as the state's management
and barn damage caused by the horses.</TE>
<TE>   Richard Troy, deputy director for state park operations, defended
Harris, saying the problems have percolated for decades. "The
problems are not of his making. You have to understand that the state
is trying to run an operation at a historic national shrine and some
preservationists don't believe private horses or any horses should be
boarded there."</TE>
<TE>   Harris has been invited to participate in a comprehensive report
on the park's future, Troy said. "I'm sure it's going to be a lot
easier in Orange County, where [Harris] won't have the constraints or
politics here."</TE>
<TE>   But politics of another sort could hamstring Western Heritage's
long-term plans for El Toro stables, especially if Measure W, a
countywide initiative, is approved by voters in March. The measure
seeks to replace airport zoning at the former base with zoning for an
urban park, university complex and sports fields.</TE>
<TE>   The stables' future hangs in the balance, as does any contract for
agricultural leases and recreational programs at the former base.
Harris, who said he wants to stay clear of airport politics, said it
would be easier to negotiate a longer lease, such as 10 or 15 years,
so he could add community programs to introduce disadvantaged youth
to the county's equestrian heritage.</TE>
<TE>   "We could even add overnight trail rides and bring in the
non-equestrian community," he said.</TE>
<TE>   County supervisors have stressed that the recreational programs
must earn a profit. Otherwise, there is the likelihood that they
would padlock the base, as they have threatened to do, rather than
subsidize those activities with taxpayer money.</TE>
<TE>   During a recent tour of the facility, Harris, a strapping 6-foot-3
cowboy who bought his first pony with money he made selling avocados
as a youngster growing up in south San Gabriel, said he wants to
first put in some "sweat equity" by cleaning up the 150-horse center,
refurbishing arenas, hauling junk to the dump and bringing in stalls
for more horses.</TE>
<TE>   According to Harris' marketing plan, his concept has attracted
interest from horse trainers with a clientele of another 150 horses.
He is tight-lipped about raising boarding fees, but many who board
their horses there now expect that to happen.</TE>
<TE>   For years, horse owners using El Toro have enjoyed some of the
cheapest rates in the county. Upscale stables charge an average of
$400 a month for a 12-by-12-foot stall.</TE>
<TE>   Star Lewis, who boards two horses at El Toro, said rents average
$225 to $250, with feed. Veterinarian Sarah McCarthy of Lake Forest,
who boards her horse, Aurio, in a 60-by-90-foot paddock at El Toro,
pays $225 a month.</TE>
<TE>   Harris said he will rely on help from his board of directors to
pitch in with the stable project.</TE>
<TE>   He created Western Heritage in 1986 to fight a city-inspired
proposal to tax horses in San Juan Capistrano. In addition to Gates,
Harris said the board includes Gilbert Aguirre, executive vice
president at Rancho Mission Viejo; Raul Ramos, former Orange County
undersheriff; and Shigeru "Shig" Kinoshita, a retired farmer.</TE>

<HD>O.C. Charter: Plan for Voters or Politicians?</HD>
<DH>Government: Supervisor Spitzer backs the measure as a step
for democracy while others says it's a backdoor way to fill his seat
should he be elected to Assembly.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SCOTT MARTELLE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>To hear Todd Spitzer tell it, Measure V on Orange County's March 5
ballot embodies the essence of democracy by letting voters fill
vacant seats on the county Board of Supervisors, rather than having
the governor appoint someone.</LD>
<LD>   From Richard F. Taylor's somewhat different perspective, Measure V
is an end-run by insider politicians who want to swap jobs and
subvert voter-approved term limits while simultaneously trying to
stack the political deck against converting the former El Toro Marine
base into a commercial airport.</LD>
<LD>   But for the average voter, the looming question about Measure V is
whether the issue--enacting a charter form of county government--will
make any difference in their lives. For the most part, counties exist
to do the local work of the state, such as administering social
services programs, and have less legal authority than cities, said
Steve Keil, legislative representative for the state Assn. of
Counties in Sacramento.</LD>
<TE>   Most of the state's 58 counties, including Orange County, operate
under what is known as general law, which means their tasks are
largely defined by the state Legislature.</TE>
<TE>   But 13 counties, including Los Angeles County, operate under
voter-approved charters that give them more freedom on such issues as
how to select supervisors--including the number of supervisorial
seats--and how to deal with administrative issues, from the hiring of
department heads to pay scales.</TE>
<TE>   Under Measure V, though, the only element that would change from
Orange County's current setup is how vacant supervisorial seats are
filled. Now the governor fills them. If Measure V passes, special
elections would be held.</TE>
<TE>   Spitzer, 3rd District supervisor and an opponent of creating an
airport at El Toro, said he pushed the measure onto the ballot
because he didn't like the idea that Gov. Gray Davis would appoint
his successor if he wins the 71st Assembly seat being vacated by Bill
Campbell (R-Villa Park), who cannot run for reelection because of
term limits.</TE>
<TE>   Under county term limits, he said, more supervisors could be
leaving their seats as they move up to other elected positions in
midterm, creating the potential for political stalemates if the
five-member board is reduced to four members who could deadlock.</TE>
<TE>   State law gives the governor no deadline for filling vacancies.
Siskiyou County recently went more than a year with a vacant
supervisor's seat, Spitzer said.</TE>
<TE>   "What would happen in Orange County if there was a vacancy for
over a year?" Spitzer asked. "It's very unfair to the constituents of
that district, and it empowers the other supervisors in other
districts to make decisions on behalf of those constituents. We have
an obligation for self-determination and a responsibility to
determine our own destiny."</TE>
<TE>   Taylor--a longtime supporter of converting El Toro into a
commercial airport--disagrees, rejecting Spitzer's arguments as a
smokescreen.</TE>
<TE>   Taylor said the real issue is Spitzer's desire to control who will
succeed him should he win the Assembly seat; if he loses, he would
remain on the Board of Supervisors. Taylor expects that if Measure V
passes, Campbell will run for the seat in a special election. Like
Spitzer, Campbell opposes an airport at El Toro.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a sham and it's wrong," said Taylor, president of the
Airport Working Group of Orange County, formed about 20 years ago to
lobby against expansion of John Wayne Airport. "They want to get this
backroom deal and work this out.... It's totally about the airport.
This charter does nothing to lower taxes. It does nothing to make
government more accountable. It's a waste of money and time."</TE>
<TE>   Spitzer disputed Taylor's analysis as a self-serving attempt to
reduce the voice of anti-airport advocates on the board, which
routinely approves pro-airport measures by a 3-2 vote with Spitzer in
the minority.</TE>
<TE>   And he rejected arguments by some critics that a charter would
bring the possibility of endless voter initiatives.</TE>
<TE>   "That's a spurious argument," Spitzer said, pointing out that
voters can put initiatives on the ballot now. "It's a fundamental
right to safeguard against an abusive government."</TE>
<TE>   Effects of Voter Initiatives Debated</TE>
<TE>   Keil said voter initiatives could not change the charter contrary
to state and federal laws or mandates. For instance, a charter
amendment could not reduce social service payments to families below
the state-set levels.</TE>
<TE>   "There could be an initiative that might deal with a related
issue, such as saying the county is going to provide a new level of
service," he said.</TE>
<TE>   And placing a change in the charter on the ballot would require
petitions signed by 10% of the county's registered voters--currently
about 71,000 signatureswhich make it difficult for fringe or nuisance
charter amendments to reach the ballot, Keil and others said.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles County has operated under a charter since 1913 and has
had no voter-initiated amendments that current officials can recall.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a lot of work getting an initiative that size," said Hal
Melom, an attorney in the Los Angeles County counsel's office.</TE>
<TE>   One relatively recent change came in 1978, when voters approved a
charter amendment making it simpler for county officials to contract
for work not easily done by staff members. The downside, he said, is
that general-law counties can effect change by pressuring state
legislators, while charter counties "have to go directly to the
voters."</TE>

<HD>Lessons Teach History as It Happens</HD>
<DH>Schools: Calabasas group designs civics instruction with
more relevance for students.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEPHANIE STASSEL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Like many civics teachers, Jerry Mullady has used the events of Sept.
11 to create what educators call a "teachable moment."</LD>
<LD>   During a recent lively discussion at Burbank's John Burroughs High
School, his class considered such complex issues as individual rights
versus the country's best interest, which were debated by the authors
of the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution. These have
taken on renewed interest since the terrorist attacks.</LD>
<LD>   Should a person be denied a seat on an airplane because he or she
looks suspicious? Would a national identification card keep people
safe or infringe on their privacy? Is it OK to violate a person's
rights if it could potentially avert another terrorist attack?</LD>
<TE>   "You have to give up some rights to have the majority protected,"
said Burroughs High senior Adrianne Sce, admitting that for the first
time she truly understood the theory of classical republicanism,
which asserts the best kind of society is one that promotes the
common good instead of the interests of only one class of citizens.</TE>
<TE>   Senior Rusty Palmer called this his most interesting civics class
ever.</TE>
<TE>   "I feel like I'm learning a lot more," he said. "Up until nine
days ago, I'd never heard of the term classical republicanism."</TE>
<TE>   Mullady says in-depth discussions like this might not have
happened without help from the Center for Civic Education, a
Calabasas-based nonprofit, nonpartisan organization that writes
civics lessons and books for students in kindergarten through 12th
grade.</TE>
<TE>   He discovered the center while searching for teaching tools on the
Internet and decided to participate in a teacher-training program
that highlighted one of the center's textbooks, "We the People: The
Citizen and the Constitution."</TE>
<TE>   "It brought [history] alive," said Mullady, who is himself a
Burroughs graduate. "I realized what more I could be teaching. It got
me excited about the Bill of Rights."</TE>
<TE>   The Calabasas center has its roots in a UCLA committee on civic
education formed in 1965 to develop a curriculum on due process for
upper elementary and high school students. A textbook for
kindergarten through 12th-grade, "Foundations of Democracy:
Authority, Privacy, Responsibility and Justice," was first published
in 1969, followed by "We the People: The Citizen and the
Constitution," which since its publication 15 years ago has been used
by 26.5 million public, private and home-schooled students
nationwide.</TE>
<TE>   Supporters say the textbook makes civics education more active and
relevant than traditional publications. It isn't about learning names
and dates, but about giving kids a strong foundation from which they
can critically discuss the Bill of Rights and what it means to be a
citizen.</TE>
<TE>   "They aren't memorizing it. They deal with it, grapple with it,
take it apart and put it back together," said Kevin Fox, who uses the
text in his senior Advanced Placement government class at Arcadia
High School.</TE>
<TE>   As a result, he said, his students are anxious to be old enough to
vote because "they understand their votes count."</TE>
<TE>   "It's not flag-waving patriotism," Fox said. "It's a thoughtful
patriotism. It's thinking about what's happening, as opposed to
jumping on the bandwagon. [James] Madison wanted a thoughtful
citizenry."</TE>
<TE>   Many students in "We the People" classes compete locally each year
to determine who will represent their state in Washington, D.C., at a
mock congressional hearing held each May by the Center for Civic
Education. Earlier this month, Bakersfield's Centennial High School
won the state competition, narrowly beating Arcadia High School, a
three-time national competitor.</TE>
<TE>   Lynne Cheney, who chaired the National Endowment for the
Humanities from 1986 to 1993, said colleges, libraries and
individuals should sponsor teach-ins on the nation's history to
combat a serious lack of historical knowledge among youth..</TE>
<TE>   Cheney, the wife of Vice President Dick Cheney, is working on
"America: A Patriotic Primer" for elementary school students. She
often cites a 1999 survey of college seniors--from such elite
universities as Princeton, Yale and Stanford--that showed only one in
five knew that the words "government of the people, by the people,
for the people" came from Lincoln's 1863 Gettysburg Address.</TE>
<TE>   She said schools haven't done a very good job of teaching American
history. During her tenure at the NEH, she published a report that
warned about the failure of schools to teach knowledge of the past to
today's children.</TE>
<TE>   Despite this concern, President Bush hasn't included any money in
his proposed budget for civics education, said Rep. Brad Sherman
(D-Sherman Oaks), whose district includes the Center for Civic
Education's headquarters in Calabasas.</TE>
<TE>   For 20 years, the center has received federal money--including an
$11.85-million grant last year--to distribute its textbooks and
promote teacher training.</TE>
<TE>   "The whole concept of civic education is currently budgeted for
zero dollars. It's somewhat disingenuous for [Cheney] to be saying
the country needs more civic education without putting anything in
the budget for it," Sherman said.</TE>
<TE>   Chuck Quigley, the center's executive director, said there was no
allocation in the president's budget last year, but Congress later
added funds.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm always worried about funding, but we have very, very strong
support across the spectrum in Congress, from conservatives to
liberals. We're hoping we will continue to get that support," said
Quigley, a former public school teacher who has been with the center
since it began.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to domestic programs, the center administers a program
called "We the People ... Project Citizen" in more than 30 countries.
Students learn about public policy by tackling a problem in their
community. The Russian Ministry of Education recently approved using
the program in all its schools on a pilot basis.</TE>
<TE>   Center officials are hoping soon to add Afghanistan and Pakistan
to their list. The center's staff has submitted to the U.S. Agency
for International Development plans for implementing the program and
are awaiting a response.</TE>
<TE>   "The center has been in tension areas like Bosnia and Kosovo soon
after the turmoil ended," said Jack N. Hoar, director of the center's
international programs.</TE>

<HD>Contract for Deputies Looms Large Over Supervisor's Race</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARGARET TALEV</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Ventura County Supervisor Judy Mikels and challenger John Lane often
draw sharply different reactions from law enforcement officers they
encounter on the campaign trail.</LD>
<LD>   "I know who you are. I'm a deputy sheriff," one man snapped when
Mikels introduced herself recently while canvassing a neighborhood in
her hometown of Simi Valley. Another deputy, she said, slammed the
door in her face.</LD>
<LD>   Lane, on the other hand, usually has enjoyed a friendlier
reception:</LD>
<TE>   "You're LAPD? I am too," one retired officer told Lane after
reading his campaign literature. The man asked what he could do to
help Lane get elected.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, Lane is betting heavily on his appeal as a retired Los
Angeles police officer to upset his better-known and better-funded
rival. And for good reason.</TE>
<TE>   The push by Ventura County sheriff's deputies for a costly
increase in benefits is one of the driving issues in the March 5
contest between Mikels and Lane in the 4th supervisorial district,
which includes Simi Valley, Moorpark and Somis.</TE>
<TE>   Lane, 54, has tried to broaden his base of support by advocating
campaign finance reform and opposing the Ahmanson Ranch housing
development that Mikels, a landowners' rights advocate, supports. But
the deputies' bid to oust Mikels has dominated the race.</TE>
<TE>   As a result, Mikels, 56, has been quick to label her rival a
one-issue candidate.</TE>
<TE>   She maintains that the county cannot afford all of the deputies'
contract demands, which include an expansion of retirement benefits.
The real sticking point, Mikels says, is that the benefits package
desired by deputies would be applied retroactively, costing the
county tens of millions of extra dollars that it doesn't have.</TE>
<TE>   The two-term incumbent, who is endorsed by Dist. Atty. Michael D.
Bradbury, said she is confident that voters can differentiate between
her support for law enforcement and her views on the union's contract
demands.</TE>
<TE>   "Most people can make the distinction," Mikels said. "No one has
asked, 'What is that problem, why are they mad at you?' It's just not
resonating with the public."</TE>
<TE>   Lane, who works as chief fraud investigator for the Los Angeles
city attorney's office, agrees that the deputies are "asking too
much." He favors an improved benefits plan that is retroactive, but
not necessarily everything the deputies are seeking.</TE>
<TE>   Lane's law enforcement credentials have won him the endorsement of
the 815-member Ventura County Deputy Sheriff's Assn., which
contributed $15,000 to his campaign and has provided dozens of
volunteers to walk precincts.</TE>
<TE>   Glen Kitzmann, president of the union, said while Lane hasn't
promised anything specific, he has first-hand knowledge of public
safety matters and would likely be more open-minded in contract
negotiations.</TE>
<TE>   "Ventura County has been consistently very public-safety-minded,"
Kitzmann said. "They have someone [in Lane] who's been there
hands-on, who understands what it takes to provide police and fire
services."</TE>
<TE>   Mikels is undeterred.</TE>
<TE>   She says safeguarding law enforcement budgets has always been one
of her top priorities. She points out that she was among the board
majority that voted to set aside Proposition 172 sales tax money
exclusively for public safety agencies. About $40 million a year is
generated by the half-cent tax in Ventura County.</TE>
<TE>   Mikels believes many deputies will support her at the ballot box
despite the union's official position. And the union's attacks on her
won't sway a majority of the district's voters, she says.</TE>
<TE>   Bradbury says that part of Mikels' appeal is her willingness to
take a firm stand on the issues.</TE>
<TE>   "She says what she means and she means what she says," Bradbury
said. "She doesn't raise a moistened finger to the sky to see which
way the political wind is blowing. And she is a strong supporter of
law enforcement."</TE>
<TE>   Mikels has reason to be confident. Her early polls showed her 30%
ahead of Lane. And as of last month, she had raised $75,000, compared
with Lane's $58,000--about half of which he loaned himself.</TE>
<TE>   Mikels' funds came from farmers, business leaders, the county
government workers' union and developers, including billionaire David
Murdock, who contributed more than $27,000 and hosted a Mikels
fund-raiser at his Sherwood Country Club. "She understands the
importance of economic growth in Ventura County," Murdock said.</TE>
<TE>   Though critics say she leans too heavily on the side of
developers, Mikels also has drawn support from people like Rorie
Skei, deputy director of the Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy.</TE>
<TE>   "She is concerned about private property rights, but our agency
realizes that we have to work with landowners--they're the ones who
have the land," Skei said.</TE>
<TE>   Skei said Mikels has supported conservancy efforts, including the
acquisition of Rocky Peak Park, a 4,800-acre property east of Simi
Valley. "She is approachable," Skei said, "and someone that, if given
a good argument, will listen."</TE>
<TE>   Among Mikels' proudest accomplishments: the reestablishment of a
county agriculture commission and the creation of an east county
facility where sexual assault victims can receive medical exams to
assist in police investigations.</TE>
<TE>   If reelected, Mikels said her priorities will be to maintain a
balanced budget, improve mental health services for adults and
children and encourage a healthy business climate countywide.</TE>
<TE>   But not everyone is lining up to support her. Indeed, Mikels has
made her share of enemies during her eight years on the board.</TE>
<TE>   Besides the deputies, critics include slow-growth advocates,
opponents of a Tierra Rejada golf driving range she helped shepherd
through and Somis residents opposed to the widening of California
118.</TE>
<TE>   Moorpark Councilman Clint Harper is critical of her support for
the gravel mining industry north of his city. He said she has ignored
concerns about ever-increasing truck traffic through Moorpark.</TE>
<TE>   What bothers him most, he said, is Mikels' sometimes
rough-and-tumble style, not just on the dais but with constituents
with whom she disagrees. "She's arrogant," Harper said. "I find her
abrasive."</TE>
<TE>   Kitzmann said Mikels is not as popular as she once was. Two years
ago, in the middle of her second term, Mikels launched an
unsuccessful bid for state Senate. "She ran for a state office
mid-term," he said. "So how committed was she to really wanting to
serve the county anymore?"</TE>
<TE>   Lane also has aspired to state office. In 1998, he ran
unsuccessfully for the Assembly. But he says he has refocused his
ambitions on the local level.</TE>
<TE>   The candidate hopes both to attract Mikels' critics and draw
strong support from his hometown of Moorpark, where he served as a
one-term councilman and mayor in the 1980s.</TE>
<TE>   While on the council, he says he helped write an ordinance
providing rent protections for senior citizens in mobile home parks
and established the city's first senior center. He also crafted a
tree preservation ordinance and played a key role in getting the city
its own ambulance service.</TE>
<TE>   "I have the ... experience to lead this county into the future in
a positive light," he said.</TE>
<TE>   If elected, Lane says he will push for a policy limiting
supervisors to two terms and capping campaign donations at $250 per
contributor. Other priorities are bolstering the sheriff's budget to
counter bioterrorism and redirecting more funds to help troubled
youths.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike Mikels, Lane opposes the 3,050-home Ahmanson Ranch
development planned at the county's southeastern edge. The project
was approved by supervisors in 1992 but has been stalled by lawsuits.</TE>
<TE>   He also pointed out that Mikels initially opposed state
legislation that would allow county voters to create a
taxpayer-funded land preservation authority and only recently decided
to support the bill.</TE>
<TE>   But Lane appears to be a recent convert to the anti-sprawl
movement. He voted against a successful slow-growth ordinance, SOAR,
when it was approved by Moorpark voters in 1999. He now supports the
measure.</TE>
<TE>   Like Mikels, he also has his critics.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm concerned he's promising something he may not be able to
deliver to the sheriffs," Simi Valley Councilwoman Barbra Williamson
said.</TE>
<TE>   "And if he does deliver it, what's going to happen to the county's
financial situation?"</TE>

<HD>Park Face-Lift Is a Team Effort</HD>
<DH>Recreation: Youth soccer league and Little League are
raising funds to help improve playing fields at the Conejo Creek
facility.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CARRI KARUHN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The soccer fields at Conejo Creek Park south are a mess. The ground
is bumpy, the turf is dug up and the chalked boundary lines are
barely visible.</LD>
<LD>   "There is like no grass," soccer player Wendy Weissberg, 14, said
as she sat on the sidelines, watching her Westlake High School
teammates compete. The field is "really hard and it's all dirt.
Sometimes the dirt gets in your eyes and you can't see."</LD>
<LD>   Simi Valley parent Kathy Penn has safety concerns. "If you have
the kids playing soccer and running over the potholes, there's all
kinds of potential for injury."</LD>
<TE>   A baseball diamond for the Little Leaguers who visit the park is
nonexistent.</TE>
<TE>   But conditions should soon improve at the 53-acre park in Thousand
Oaks--site of the annual Conejo Valley Days carnival.</TE>
<TE>   In May, the Conejo Recreation and Park District is expected to
begin the first phase of a four-year plan to renovate and increase
the number of soccer fields at the popular park at Janss Road and
California 23. From 8,000 to 10,000 soccer players and spectators use
the park on weekends.</TE>
<TE>   The project, estimated to cost more than $3.5 million, will
include new turf, lighting, permanent restrooms, irrigation and
drainage systems and an 800-space parking lot.</TE>
<TE>   A full-size Little League field will be built, and the nine
existing soccer fields will be reconfigured to make room for three
new ones. Portable aluminum bleachers will allow seating wherever
it's needed in the park.</TE>
<TE>   District officials say more fields are required as the city's
population grows and competition for available land grows fierce.</TE>
<TE>   "Land is a precious commodity in Thousand Oaks," said park board
member Joe Gibson, who is also president of the Conejo Valley Little
League. "The ability for the park district to go out and purchase new
land is almost nil. So we have to look at what existing land we have,
and how we can best use it."</TE>
<TE>   Parking spaces are needed because a paved lot owned by the Conejo
Unified School District is set to be developed into a satellite
campus for Moorpark College.</TE>
<TE>   About 3,000 kids ages 5 to 18 make up the local American Youth
Soccer Organization's 317 teams and use the park's fields for weekday
practices and Saturday games. At least 100 kids were placed on a
waiting list over the last year because there aren't enough fields,
said Bill Buratto, a Thousand Oaks resident hired by the soccer
league to help raise money and write grants for the project.</TE>
<TE>   With new fields, the American Youth Soccer Organization could
increase its membership by 1,000 players.</TE>
<TE>   A baseball field at the park will give the Conejo Valley and
Thousand Oaks Little League groups a place to play. This will
eliminate the need to vie for space at Newbury Park and Thousand Oaks
high schools, where students often use the diamonds for after-school
practice and games.</TE>
<TE>   As the biggest user of the fields, the youth soccer organization
plans to raise $1 million for the project. So far, it has raised
$200,000.</TE>
<TE>   Other groups are also helping out. Conejo Valley Little League has
raised about $95,000 for a baseball diamond to be named after Amgen
Inc., which donated $50,000 toward its installation. The Conejo
Valley Days organization has raised $20,000.</TE>
<TE>   The $1-million first phase will include installing the baseball
field and three soccer fields on the south end of the park, along
with drainage and irrigation systems. Work is expected to be
completed by late fall.</TE>
<TE>   The nine existing soccer fields will be renovated each year in
phases. Three fields will be closed at a time for installation of new
turf and drainage and irrigation systems. "It takes five months to
grow sports turf so it's ready to be played on," said Loren Pluth,
the district's senior park development planner.</TE>
<TE>   When those fields are reopened the following season, three other
fields will be closed for improvements. All 12 fields should be
completed by summer 2006.</TE>

<DH>Holiday: New espionage exhibit grabs the attention of the
crowd at the annual Presidents Day celebration at the Reagan Library.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HOLLY J. WOLCOTT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Abraham Lincoln impersonator was popular posing for souvenir
photographs, and hot dog sales were brisk, but the biggest draw
Monday at Ronald Reagan Presidential Library were the spy gadgets.</LD>
<LD>   To celebrate Presidents Day, hundreds of people came to the
hilltop museum near Simi Valley to see a deadly poison-dart umbrella,
a lipstick tube with a hidden recording device and, of course,
Maxwell Smart's shoe phone.</LD>
<LD>   A recitation of the Gettysburg Address and sunny picnic weather
vied for attention, but by 11 a.m. a line had formed at the front
door for the museum's newest exhibit, "Spies: Secrets from the CIA,
KGB and Hollywood."</LD>
<TE>   "Considering all that's going on in the world right now and how
much of this stuff is kept secret, this is awesome," said Harry Danes
of Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   The exhibition, which opened Monday, marks the first time several
of the gadgets have been shown publicly.</TE>
<TE>   Many of the more than 400 devices on display are on loan for the
next five months from the CIA's private museum in Langley, Va. Other
pieces were borrowed from private collectors.</TE>
<TE>   For the $5 price of a ticket, visitors saw tire spikes, bombs and
various pistols, along with several concealed cameras, including one
hidden in a suit jacket and another in a leather glove.</TE>
<TE>   One section of the exhibition includes television and movie
paraphernalia, such as the fake tarantula that nearly killed 007 in
"Dr. No," and Diana Rigg's leather pants from the spy show "The
Avengers."</TE>
<TE>   "I've been watching reruns of James Bond movies the last few
Saturdays and decided it would be cool to see some of this stuff up
close," said Brianna Millhouse of Oxnard.</TE>
<TE>   While lines of people inched their way through the exhibition
hall, dozens more relaxed at outdoor tables, where several
presidential look-alikes strolled and chatted with the visitors about
American history.</TE>
<TE>   "I shock people every once in a while," said Jay Koch, a Port
Hueneme resident who looks like President Reagan, albeit a few inches
shorter.</TE>
<TE>   Joan O'Brien of Simi Valley brought granddaughter Codi Rex, 6, to
see Thomas Jefferson and George Washington look-alikes and inspect
the youth activities, which included coloring pictures of presidents.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a great education for the kids and an opportunity for them
to learn a little bit about history," O'Brien said.</TE>

<HD>Another Setback for Hearn</HD>
<DH>Pro basketball: Laker announcer, recovering from heart
surgery, breaks his hip, delaying planned March 1 return.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LARRY STEWART</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Chick Hearn, the Lakers' legendary announcer, suffered a broken hip
in a mishap at a gas station Sunday night and is scheduled for
surgery today at Valley Presbyterian Hospital in Sherman Oaks.</LD>
<LD>   Although details were unclear, Hearn apparently fell as he was
getting out of his car. Paramedics were called to the scene and Hearn
was transported to Valley Presbyterian.</LD>
<LD>   Hearn and his wife, Marge, were on their way out to dinner.</LD>
<TE>   "It's very, very devastating news," Hearn's broadcast partner, Stu
Lantz, said Monday.</TE>
<TE>   Hearn broke the femoral neck, a Laker spokesman said. A two-hour
procedure, to be performed by orthopedic surgeon Herbert Huddleston,
is scheduled for 4 p.m. today.</TE>
<TE>   It's expected that Hearn will have the ball of the hip replaced,
although hospital spokesperson Lisa Bianconi said that was not
definite. She called the surgery exploratory.</TE>
<TE>   A news conference will be held today after the surgery, when more
will be known about the operation and the length of recovery. Hearn
is expected to be hospitalized for a week.</TE>
<TE>   If he has the ball replaced, it is not clear how long the recovery
would be. Patients who have had full hip replacement say the recovery
period is three to six months, and that the surgery is particularly
tough on older patients. Hearn turned 85 in November.</TE>
<TE>   Hearn, the only play-by-play announcer the Lakers have had since
they moved to Los Angeles from Minneapolis in 1960, has been
recovering from heart surgery and planned to return to work March 1
for a home game against Indiana.</TE>
<TE>   "We were all looking forward to March 1," Lantz said. "It's just
not a Laker broadcast without Chick. It's just not the same."</TE>
<TE>   Laker players learned of Hearn's injury at practice Monday.</TE>
<TE>   Shaquille O'Neal, expected to make his return against the Boston
Celtics at Staples Center tonight, called Hearn "the original
Superman."</TE>
<TE>   "When he gets done with the surgery, it wouldn't surprise me if he
tries to come back with a hip cast," O'Neal said.</TE>
<TE>   He may have a point. Hearn was said to be negotiating with the
nurses at Valley Presbyterian to be released sooner than a week.</TE>
<TE>   O'Neal also said, "We love you Chick. Take your time coming back."</TE>
<TE>   Derek Fisher said, "You have a lot of respect for someone who
comes to work every day, no matter their age--whether you're 18 or
88, whether you're feeling good or feeling bad.</TE>
<TE>   "Chick absolutely made that type of commitment and earned people's
respect. That's why it's hard that he's been out so long. We just
want him to be healthy."</TE>
<TE>   Hearn worked 3,338 consecutive games over 36 years before the
streak was ended by his heart surgery.</TE>
<TE>   "Chick Hearn and Laker basketball are synonymous," Lantz said.
"We're just holding down the fort."</TE>
<TE>   Paul Sunderland has been filling in since Hearn had heart surgery
on Dec. 19.</TE>
<TE>   "This is very, very sad," Sunderland said. "It's a real shame.
First, it's devastating for Chick personally. And it has got to be
devastating for Marge, maybe even more devastating than the heart
surgery. I can't tell you how badly I feel for them."</TE>
<TE>   The versatile Sunderland cleared his busy schedule once he was
asked to fill in for Hearn. Besides his NBA duties for NBC, Fox
Sports Net and Turner, he was also scheduled to announce snowboarding
at the Winter Olympics for NBC.</TE>
<TE>   Sunderland said the Lakers still get precedence.</TE>
<TE>   "I made a commitment to the Lakers that I would fill in as long as
necessary," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Susan Stratton, Channel 9's longtime executive producer of Laker
telecasts and a close friend of the Hearns, said she talked with
Marge Sunday night.</TE>
<TE>   "She was very upset, and she is usually such a strong person,"
Stratton said. "She said Chick was very depressed."</TE>
<TE>   Stratton said Marge told her she had made dinner and that she and
Chick were planning to stay home Sunday night.</TE>
<TE>   But after watching the Lakers lose to Portland that afternoon,
Hearn told Marge he was upset and wanted to go out.</TE>
<TE>   They stopped for gas on their way to dinner.</TE>
<TE>   "This is just awful. Everything was coming together for them,"
Stratton said. "Chick was as happy and up as he has been in quite a
while.</TE>
<TE>   "Then this has to happen to him."</TE>

<HD>An Ace Needs No Bandage</HD>
<DH>Baseball: Brown's strong showing in workout 41/2 months
after elbow surgery is a relief to Dodgers.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE DiGIOVANNA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>VERO BEACH, Fla.</DL>
<LD>The ace of the Dodger rotation provided a huge dose of relief Monday.
Showing off his surgically repaired right elbow to a large contingent
of coaches, medical staff and front-office workers, Kevin Brown made
40 long-toss throws and threw 40 pitches off flat ground in his first
spring-training appearance, an outing that seemed mundane to him but
dazzling to the Dodgers.</LD>
<LD>   "The thing that was most special to me was the way the ball came
out of his hand," Manager Jim Tracy said. "The ball jumped out of his
hand instead of it having to be an effort to come out. He had surgery
in late September, and here we are in mid-February. For a guy to be
throwing that firmly off flat ground shows you there are no residual
effects [from the surgery]."</LD>
<LD>   Brown provided a little comic relief, too.</LD>
<TE>   After his third long toss, with General Manager Dan Evans,
assistant GM Kim Ng, physical therapist Pat Screnar, pitching coach
Jim Colborn and Tracy in attendance, Brown, who underwent surgery to
repair a torn flexor muscle last September, clutched his right elbow
and winced as if in pain.</TE>
<TE>   Just kidding.</TE>
<TE>   "That was taking gallows humor to another degree, but I appreciate
his sense of humor," Evans said. "I'm just glad it wasn't a live
show."</TE>
<TE>   Colborn said Brown looked better Monday than he did at any time
during the second half of the 2001 season.</TE>
<TE>   "He looked very smooth, fluid and powerful and had better life on
the ball," Colborn said. "Nothing surprises me with Kevin Brown."</TE>
<TE>   Brown has been throwing vigorously for a few weeks, so Monday
wasn't that big a deal to him. His next big step will probably come
at the end of this week or early next week: throwing off a mound.</TE>
<TE>   "What I did today was pretty mild," said Brown, who is in the
fourth year of a seven-year, $105-million contract.</TE>
<TE>   "From the descriptions I got from other players and medical people
[about the recovery], I didn't expect a lot of problems. I'm not real
anxious about it. Things have gone pretty much like they predicted."</TE>
<TE>   Tracy said the Dodgers "won't push the envelope" during Brown's
rehabilitation. Though Brown will continue his throwing regimen and
take part in fielding drills with the rest of the pitchers, he won't
take batting practice until he feels he's throwing normally.</TE>
<TE>   "There's nothing I have to really be careful of, I'm just going to
try to not be too aggressive with it," Brown said. "But I haven't
felt this good in a year and a half."</TE>
<TE>   Brown, who turns 37 in March, had an 8-4 record and 2.95
earned-run average through last July 15. He beat the Pirates in
Pittsburgh that day but left the game because of elbow pain after
five innings and flew back to Los Angeles to be examined by Dr. Frank
Jobe.</TE>
<TE>   The diagnosis: a severe sprain of the flexor muscle in his right
elbow.</TE>
<TE>   Brown went on the disabled list and returned in late August, but
further damaged his elbow in four starts. The flexor muscle had torn,
and Brown underwent surgery on Sept. 27.</TE>
<TE>   The Dodger medical staff monitored Brown's rehabilitation closely
over the winter, and Brown passed his first test in Dodgertown
Monday, throwing two- and four-seam fastballs, sinkers and cut
fastballs in a bullpen area surrounded by willow trees.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not the final exam, we know that, but it's very
encouraging," Evans said.</TE>
<TE>   "You could feel a giant sigh from a lot of people who hadn't been
closely involved in the [rehabilitation] process. You could also hear
that he made a lot of progress because he popped the catcher's mitt
pretty good."</TE>

<HD>Gruden Gets Big Bucs, Raiders Get Draft Picks</HD>
<DH>Pro football: Oakland trades coach to Tampa Bay for four
selections and $8 million. Dennis Green is mentioned as a possible
replacement.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SAM FARMER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Faced with the reality they would lose him one way or another, the
Oakland Raiders traded Coach Jon Gruden to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers
on Monday for four draft picks--two first-rounders and two
second-rounders--and $8 million.</LD>
<LD>   "You never try to get too surprised in this business, but this
certainly was surprising," Gruden told The Times in a phone interview
from his Pleasanton, Calif., home. He agreed to a five-year deal that
will pay him almost $4 million a season, more than tripling his
current salary. The Buccaneers will introduce him Wednesday as their
coach.</LD>
<LD>   The Raiders get the Buccaneers' first- and second-round picks this
year, their first-rounder in 2003 and a second-rounder in 2004.</LD>
<TE>   Gruden's parents live in Tampa, Fla., and his father, Jim, is a
former Buccaneer assistant. Jon's younger brother, Jay, is the
quarterback for Arena football's Orlando Predators.</TE>
<TE>   The move marked a startling about-face by Raider owner Al Davis,
and was inspired by a need to improve his struggling team and a fear
of being upstaged by the San Francisco 49ers.</TE>
<TE>   The Buccaneers, desperate to land a high-profile replacement for
Tony Dungy and rebuffed by the Raiders in their first run at Gruden,
turned last week to 49er Coach Steve Mariucci. They received
permission to interview him, and he appeared ready to leave for the
right price.</TE>
<TE>   That left the Raiders mulling two unsavory possibilities. First,
their cross-bay rivals would receive a slew of draft picks for
Mariucci, whereas Oakland would get nothing for Gruden after his
contract expired in February 2003. Second, the 49ers could have used
General Manager Terry Donahue as an interim coach for one season,
then replaced him with Gruden in 2003.</TE>
<TE>   So the Raiders took the picks and let go of their most popular and
charismatic coach since John Madden. Gruden had gone from 34-year-old
wunderkind, when he was hired to replace Joe Bugel in 1998, to a
silver-and-black cult hero. People magazine named him one of its 50
most beautiful people, but Gruden is better known for his sideline
sneer, which earned him the nickname "Chucky" among his players and
devotees.</TE>
<TE>   He was 40-28 in four seasons with the Raiders, leading them to the
playoffs the last two seasons after a six-year drought. They hosted
the AFC championship game a year ago, and this season advanced to the
second round, where they lost at New England in a game that turned on
a controversial instant-replay reversal of an apparent fumble.</TE>
<TE>   "I learned a lot from Al Davis and I got a lot better as a coach,"
Gruden said. "I'll miss the fans, the players and the coaches. But
don't get me wrong, I'm excited about the challenges ahead."</TE>
<TE>   Most challenged are the Raiders, who begin their third coaching
search since returning to Oakland in 1995.</TE>
<TE>   An early favorite to fill the job is former Minnesota Viking coach
Dennis Green, who was considered by the Raiders before Gruden was
hired.</TE>
<TE>   The Raider vacancy is less than appealing on several fronts. Davis
is meddlesome, the roster is loaded with old players--including
receivers Tim Brown (35), and Jerry Rice (39) and quarterback Rich
Gannon (36)--the franchise is financially strapped (thanks in part to
losing its most recent court case against the NFL), and former No. 2
overall pick Darrell Russell is facing rape charges.</TE>
<TE>   Still, until Monday, it looked as if Gruden would be Oakland's
coach for one more season. He turned down an offer from Ohio State a
year ago and could have been the Notre Dame coach had he wanted the
job.</TE>
<TE>   Tampa Bay was desperate to save face after firing Dungy, the most
successful coach in franchise history, then failing to lure Bill
Parcells out of retirement. The Buccaneers briefly flirted with the
idea of hiring Baltimore Raven defensive coordinator Marvin Lewis
before turning to Mariucci, who reportedly was seeking a seven-year,
$42-million deal.</TE>
<TE>   "We talked about contract, but nothing had been agreed upon as far
as solid numbers," Mariucci said Monday.</TE>
<TE>   It may never be known if the Buccaneers were truly interested in
Mariucci, or merely twisting the arm of the Raiders with a shrewd
negotiating ploy.</TE>
<TE>   "We were determined not to let outside pressures derail us from
our goal to find the best person to coach the Buccaneers. Our fans
deserve nothing less," Bryan Glazer, the team's executive vice
president, said in a statement.</TE>
<TE>   "That person is Jon Gruden, the finest young mind in the game. We
took our time and got the man we really wanted and we couldn't be
more thrilled."</TE>
<TE>   Davis said he was approached several times in the last few weeks
by Buccaneer officials who were interested in Gruden. The last
contact came around 10 p.m. Sunday, when he was called at home by
Joel Glazer, a Buccaneer vice president and son of owner Malcolm
Glazer.</TE>
<TE>   "Believe me, it was shocking," Davis said.</TE>
<TE>   According to Davis, the two talked for a half-hour, with Glazer
reiterating his interest in Gruden and making his final offer.</TE>
<TE>   "I said, 'OK, I'll talk to our people,'" said Davis, adding he
called team executives Amy Trask and Bruce Allen as well as a few
scouts "just to get a feel of where the draft is headed and what's
going on out there with free agency."</TE>
<TE>   Davis called Glazer back, said he was interested in letting him
talk to Gruden, provided Davis could talk to Gruden first. Then,
Davis called Gruden.</TE>
<TE>   "He said, 'Look, my family lives there. I grew up there. My father
worked there. My father was a coach there. My father was a scout
there,'" Davis said. "He brought up some stories that I didn't even
know."</TE>
<TE>   By 3 a.m., after a flurry of faxes, the deal was done.</TE>

<LD>He may have lost the big race, but he wasn't forgotten when it came
to the big vote. Point Given, the strapping chestnut colt that
trainer Bob Baffert called "The Big Red Train," has been elected the
2001 horse of the year, beating out the 2000 champion, Tiznow, by 91
votes.</LD>
<LD>   The announcement was made Monday night at the Eclipse Awards
dinner in Miami Beach, Fla., where last year's champion horsemen and
divisional winners among the horses were also introduced.</LD>
<LD>   In balloting by the Daily Racing Form, turf writers and the
National Thoroughbred Racing Assn., Point Given polled 156 of the 228
votes. Tiznow, who drew 65 votes, had won an unprecedented second
Breeders' Cup Classic in October, but the rest of his year was
interrupted by a recurring back injury.</LD>
<TE>   Johannesburg won an Eclipse as the best 2-year-old male, Xtra Heat
was voted best 3-year-old filly and Fantastic Light is the champion
male on grass. Tiznow won the Eclipse for best older male for the
second straight year.</TE>
<TE>   Point Given atoned for a fifth-place finish in the Kentucky Derby,
his only loss in seven 2001 starts, by ending his career with four
straight wins in $1-million races--the Preakness, the Belmont Stakes,
the Haskell Handicap and the Travers. For the year, he earned $3.35
million. Overall, he had nine wins and three seconds in 13 starts and
earnings of $3,968,500.</TE>
<TE>   Other Eclipse winners announced Monday night were Tempera,
2-year-old filly; Gourmet Girl, older filly or mare; Squirtle Squirt,
sprinter; Banks Hill, turf female; and Pompeyo, steeplechaser. Jockey
Jerry Bailey won his fifth Eclipse, tying Laffit Pincay's record;
Bobby Frankel repeated as best trainer; Rick Englander won the owner
award; Prince Khalid Abdullah's Juddmonte Farms won a second award as
champion breeder; and the apprentice Eclipse went to Jeremy Rose.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   With Astra, the 9-5 morning-line favorite, scratched because of a
rash on her back, Blue Moon squeezed through late in the stretch to
beat Queen Of Wilshire by a neck in Monday's $150,000 Buena Vista
Handicap at Santa Anita.</TE>
<TE>   Ridden by Brice Blanc, Blue Moon completed the mile on grass in
1:352/5. The 5-year-old French-bred mare, trained by Ron Ellis, paid
$10.60 for $2 in registering her second win in four U.S. starts. Old
Money, the 2-1 favorite, finished third.</TE>
<TE>   Before the races Monday, Santa Anita's three stewards suspended
jockey Matt Garcia for 10 days and fined Alex Solis, the track's
leading rider, $1,000 for violations in Sunday's seventh race.</TE>

<KH>ANGEL REPORT</KH>
<HD>All He Needs Is 15 Wins</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BILL SHAIKIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>TEMPE, Ariz.</DL>
<LD>To secure his spot in the Angels' starting rotation, Scott
Schoeneweis figures he needs to win 15 games this season. In his
third season in the rotation, he believes, potential must blossom
into performance.</LD>
<LD>   "Every year from now on is critical," he said. "You get to a
certain point, and you're not a young guy any more. There's really no
excuses. The expectations should be met at this point in my career.</LD>
<LD>   "My expectations, the organization's expectations and my
teammates' expectations are for me to be able to be a 15-game
winner."</LD>
<TE>   Schoeneweis, 28, is the same age as Chan Ho Park and the Dodgers'
newly signed Japanese left-hander, Kazuhisa Ishii. But Schoeneweis,
who played four seasons at Duke and another four in the minor
leagues, has yet to deliver a consistent season in the majors.</TE>
<TE>   Two years ago, he went 7-10 with a 5.45 earned-run average. Last
year, he went 10-11 with a 5.08 ERA, showing durability by pitching
205 innings but ranking among the bottom 10 in the American League
for runs, hits and walks given up. Manager Mike Scioscia, noting the
Angels' sluggish offense last year, said Schoeneweis should not allow
his won-lost record to obscure his progress.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think this is anything like a critical year," Scioscia
said. "He's shown he's a major league pitcher, and I think he'll get
better."</TE>
<TE>   If he trusts his changeup enough to use it more often, and if he
pitches inside more often, he should get better. If he does not, the
Angels have options they did not have a year ago. Matt Wise is ready
for the rotation, and John Lackey and Chris Bootcheck could be by
season's end.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, Schoeneweis is eligible for salary arbitration--and a
fat raise--after the season. If he posts another ERA above 5.00, the
Angels might let him go rather than pay up. But if he wins 15
games--something no Angel has done since 1996--the team probably will
happily pay up.</TE>
<TE>   "When there are expectations, sometimes there are excuses like,
'You're younger,'" Schoeneweis said. "Those are out the window now."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Disney merchandisers hailed the 1999 arrival of Mo Vaughn as "The
Beginning of a New Mo-llennium" and sold a T-shirt with that slogan
for $23, a cap reading "Mo-llennium" for $20 and a "Little Mo"
toddler T-shirt for $10.</TE>
<TE>   The Mo-llennium ended in December, not with a championship but
with the disgruntled slugger shipped to the New York Mets. And now
Vaughn merchandise is just another item on the Angels' clearance
rack: The team Web site offers a T-shirt with Vaughn's name and
uniform number, marked down from $19.95 to $4.95.</TE>

<LD>John Henry made a grand entrance into his new team's training camp at
Fort Myers, Fla., Monday in a luxury custom bus. Then he became a man
of the people.</LD>
<LD>   Wearing a cream-colored Stetson and sunglasses, he signed numerous
autographs, chatted with fans, greeted his players on the Boston Red
Sox and bantered with reporters.</LD>
<LD>   He said personnel moves, including one that might involve General
Manager Dan Duquette, won't be made until his purchase of the team is
completed.</LD>
<TE>   He reiterated that, contrary to a published report, he doesn't
plan to move the team's spring training site to Melbourne next year.</TE>
<TE>   His deal to buy the Red Sox, approved by owners, must be closed by
next week, he said.</TE>
<TE>   His message to the players: "I'm here to support you, not here to
get involved in baseball operations."</TE>
<TE>   He also talked to Duquette in foul territory to the third-base
side of home plate while pitchers practiced fielding. Duquette may
lose his job when the sale is closed, but Henry didn't seem awkward
chatting with him or with reporters who wanted to know what they
talked about.</TE>
<TE>   "About who's going to be the next GM," Henry said with a smile.
"No, I'm just kidding."</TE>

<TE>   Two Minnesota Twin minor-league players on their way to spring
training were seriously injured in a one-car crash in Tennessee, the
team said.</TE>
<TE>   Josh Johnson, a catcher with the Twins' rookie-level team in the
Gulf Coast League last season, and Jeff Randazzo, a left-handed
pitcher for Class-A Quad City, were being treated in the intensive
care unit of Erlanger Medical Center in Chattanooga.</TE>
<TE>   The accident, in which the car rolled over, occurred around 2 a.m.
Randazzo suffered several injuries, including a fractured sternum and
a collapsed lung, which was repaired through surgery.</TE>
<TE>   Johnson was driving, no alcohol was involved and both players were
wearing seat belts, a club spokesman said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   New Florida Marlin Manager Jeff Torborg missed Monday's spring
training workout to undergo skin cancer surgery. Torborg, 60, is
expected to rejoin the team today....</TE>
<TE>   Tim Raines, 42, hoping to play his 23rd season in the major
leagues, signed a minor league contract with the Marlins and was
invited to spring training.</TE>

<DL>LAWRENCE, Kan.</DL>
<LD>In just a few unforgettable hours, Drew Gooden and his Kansas
teammates became No. 1 in the country, played one of their finest
games of the season and cut down the nets as Big 12 champions.</LD>
<LD>   "I don't think I could be any happier than I am today," said
Gooden, who scored 26 points and led the top-ranked Jayhawks to a
102-66 rout of Iowa State on Monday night.</LD>
<LD>   "This is really wonderful."</LD>
<TE>   Kansas (24-2, 13-0 Big 12), playing its first game since replacing
Duke atop the poll, got a combined 34 first-half points from its trio
of post players--Gooden, Nick Collison and Wayne Simien--en route to
a 49-25 halftime lead. Collison finished with 16 points and Simien
with 15, giving them a combined 57.</TE>
<TE>   Afterward, the Jayhawks carefully cut down part of the net --
leaving a few strings intact lest they show any disrespect to their
three remaining opponents, Nebraska, Kansas State and Missouri.</TE>
<TE>   Although their first Big 12 title in four years is practically a
cinch, they actually clinched a tie.</TE>
<TE>   Iowa State (11-16, 3-10), the two-time defending Big 12 champion,
dropped to 0-9 on the road.</TE>

<HD>Mira Costa Revs Up for Another Title Run</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE BRESNAHAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The question was raised almost as soon as the last ball of last
season was spiked:</LD>
<LD>   Can Manhattan Beach Mira Costa, with a strong corps of players
coming back from the school's fourth undefeated volleyball team, go
unbeaten again and win another Southern Section Division II boys'
championship?</LD>
<LD>   "We have that potential this year, there's no doubt about it,"
said Coach Mike Cook, in his 23rd season at Mira Costa. "We're
working on it."</LD>
<TE>   Pat Nihipali, a 6-foot-9 middle blocker who has signed with UCLA,
is among the top players in the nation. Nihipali played opposite
hitter during club season and might make the position switch for the
Mustangs this season.</TE>
<TE>   Chris Ahlfeldt, a 6-7 middle blocker, has signed with Stanford.
Gio Altamura, a 6-foot setter, has signed with Ohio State and Tyler
Caldwell, a 5-10 back-row specialist, will likely play at Long Beach
State.</TE>
<TE>   "They're certainly going to be the cornerstone of this year's
team," Cook said.</TE>
<TE>   Some uncertainty exists, however, at outside hitter.</TE>
<TE>   Josh Schwarzapel, a 6-5 junior, and Jordan Morris, a 6-foot
junior, are the leading candidates to emerge from a crowded, mostly
untested group of players on the outside. Schwarzapel and Morris
spent part of last season with the junior varsity.</TE>
<TE>   Regardless, the Mustangs, who were 29-0 last year, will have to be
on their game every night.</TE>
<TE>   "Everyone knows that last year we won it, so this year there's a
bull's-eye," Altamura said. "Everyone knows who you are, who you have
back, who's gone. It's going to be how much we want it, how hard
we're going to play to win."</TE>
<TE>   The Mustangs will find out quickly. They open the season at
perennial rival Los Angeles Loyola on March 1.</TE>
<TE>   "There's so much hype around this single match, it's ridiculous,"
Nihipali said. "People have mentioned it months before it's actually
played."</TE>
<TE>   Loyola has Derek Otte, a 6-5 opposite hitter who has signed with
USC, and Jake Schkud, a 6-5 middle blocker who transferred from Santa
Monica.</TE>
<TE>   "It's going to be something to see," Loyola Coach Michael Boehle
said. "It's going to be one of those long, drawn-out matches."</TE>
<TE>   A victory puts Mira Costa that much closer to a fifth undefeated
season.</TE>
<TE>   "As the year goes on, this is going to be a mighty team," Cook
said. "When we find out what really makes us go, we'll be
outstanding. I can guarantee that at the end of the year."</TE>

<LD>The economic woes currently plaguing Argentina have had some odd
side-effects, not least of all at Almirante Brown, a struggling
second-division soccer team in Buenos Aires.</LD>
<LD>   In wealthier times, the club used to house its players in a decent
hotel whenever they had two-a-day training sessions. Now, they go to
a less salubrious spot where the rooms rent by the hour.</LD>
<LD>   According to Ole, a sports newspaper, the 11 rooms reserved for
the 22 players feature mirrors on the ceiling and a few even have
Jacuzzis.</LD>
<TE>   Coach Fernando Zamacola drew the line at some things, however.</TE>
<TE>   "The first thing we asked the owner to do," he said, "was to cut
the cable television and remove the video recorders from the rooms in
case some of the players prefer to watch pornographic videos instead
of sleeping."</TE>
<TE>   No rest for the wicked?</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Trivia time: Which racehorse is considered the greatest of the
20th century?</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Not model behavior: Chris Webber's contract is worth $18 million a
year, but it's his relationship with model Tyra Banks that recently
was the subject of a newspaper column in Sacramento.</TE>
<TE>   Webber blasted the media for covering his personal life.</TE>
<TE>   "He may not like the attention, but it's part of the deal," said
the Sacramento Bee's J. Freedom du Lac, who wrote the column that got
Webber steamed.</TE>
<TE>   "If Tyra Banks were dating a newspaper delivery boy in Sacramento,
it would be an interesting topic.</TE>
<TE>   "That she's hanging out with the most famous person in town ...
that makes it an issue."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The optimist: David Samson, new president of the Florida Marlins,
recently purchased by his father-in-law Jeffrey Loria for $158.5
million, isn't counting on getting the money back any time soon.</TE>
<TE>   "Our business plan calls for heavy, heavy losses that we know we
have to sustain," Samson said.</TE>
<TE>   That's some plan.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Wayward flight: Tiger Woods said he had a good reason for not
taking part in last year's Accenture Match Play Championship in
Australia after losing to Darren Clarke in the final at La Costa the
year before.</TE>
<TE>   "There's always the chance of getting the boot pretty quick [in
match play]," Woods said on his official Web site. "I'd hate to fly
all that way, get smoked the first day and have to come home."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Oddballs: There's a special kind of person who goes to the
ballpark in these very early days of spring training, according to
the San Francisco Chronicle's Ray Ratto.</TE>
<TE>   "They tend to be baseball fans who cannot reconcile the high
salaries, the threat of lockouts and contraction, and the other
rampant stupidities of the major-league game with their own beliefs,"
Ratto wrote.</TE>
<TE>   "They like the game simple and pure, unmarked by greed, duplicity
and all-around reptilian behavior, even though they know that the
[unheralded] players they romanticize ... want nothing more than to
become part of that major league world that discomfits them so."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Trivia answer: No, not Secretariat. According to Blood-Horse
magazine, it was Man o'War.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   And finally: From the Chicago Sun-Times' Ron Rapoport: "Now that's
what I call a Daytona 500. A great race, a couple of crashes, a guy
caught cheating at the end and everybody lives to tell about it."</TE>

<DH>Pro basketball: L.A. falls to Portland, 80-79, as
Stoudamire hits jumper over 5-5 Boykins, who then misses at buzzer.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELLIOTT TEAFORD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Portland Trail Blazers aren't known as the wackiest bunch to lace
up a pair of high tops for absolutely no reason. They defy
conventional wisdom at every opportunity. For the Trail Blazers,
there are only two ways to play: the hard way and the harder way.</LD>
<LD>   The latest evidence was their 80-79 victory Monday over the
Clippers before a wrung-out crowd of 19,423 at Staples Center.</LD>
<LD>   Portland built an 11-point lead three minutes into the fourth
quarter only to come apart at the seams moments later before rallying
to win on point guard Damon Stoudamire's jump shot with 3.2 seconds
left.</LD>
<TE>   Stoudamire dribbled calmly on the left wing as the seconds ticked
past, then launched his jumper over Clipper guard Earl Boykins, who
stands only 5 feet 5. Stoudamire's basket was his fifth in 16
attempts.</TE>
<TE>   What, him worry?</TE>
<TE>   Then Boykins' driving shot attempt failed at the buzzer,
preserving Portland's one-point victory.</TE>
<TE>   In the end, the Trail Blazers should have had 'em all the way.
That they didn't speaks to the weirdness factor that seems to
constantly swirl around them.</TE>
<TE>   The Clippers' 12.5% shooting in the third quarter (Michael
Olowokandi three for three; everybody else 0 for 21) alone should
have doomed them to their third defeat in four games this season
against Portland.</TE>
<TE>   But the Trail Blazers' reputation is not without merit. They were
in all their glory in the fourth quarter Monday, Rasheed Wallace
swishing a jump shot in front of the Clipper bench, drawing a foul
and talking stuff to Coach Alvin Gentry.</TE>
<TE>   Soon enough, Wallace also talked stuff to the referees and picked
up a technical foul. Portland Coach Maurice Cheeks took up Wallace's
case and drew a second technical with 6:59 left in the game.</TE>
<TE>   All of which ignited a Clipper comeback from a 70-62 deficit. Jeff
McInnis made both technical free throws. Quentin Richardson drove to
the basket twice to score. Corey Maggette made a free throw and a
jumper. Olowokandi's layup gave the Clippers a 73-72 lead.</TE>
<TE>   The Clippers would lose the lead on Wallace's layup, but took it
back on an Olowokandi hook shot and a McInnis layup after Olowokandi
swiped the ball from Stoudamire.</TE>
<TE>   Stoudamire made two free throws after fouling out McInnis with
2:07 left. Richardson made a layup to give the Clippers a 79-76 lead.
Scottie Pippen and Ruben Patterson each made a free throw, closing
the gap to 79-78.</TE>
<TE>   The Clippers then crumbled, Olowokandi missing and the Trail
Blazers rebounding. Stoudamire never hesitated and sent the Clippers
off on a five-game trip losers of two of three after the All-Star
break.</TE>
<TE>   The Clippers awoke Monday to find themselves two games behind the
Trail Blazers in the Western Conference standings. The Clippers were
ninth, one spot out of the promised land. The Trail Blazers were
seventh, but given their second-half dismantling Sunday of the
Lakers, they seemed primed to rise a few spots in the standings.</TE>
<TE>   "They are one of the teams we're trying to chase," Clipper Coach
Alvin Gentry said of Portland before the game. "There are five or six
teams that are right there [in front of the Clippers]. So yeah, if
this isn't worth two games, then it's very important to us."</TE>
<TE>   The Clippers came out firing blanks. The fact that they trailed
only 42-37 by halftime was perhaps due more to their ability to roll
with the inconsistent Trail Blazers.</TE>
<TE>   Still, the Clippers' 43.2% shooting was nothing to boast about by
halftime. The Clippers also had their troubles defending Portland,
which is a tough combination to overcome.</TE>
<TE>   At one point in the second quarter, Portland scored 10 consecutive
points on layups.</TE>
<TE>   Stoudamire interrupted the streak with a short bank shot that gave
the Trail Blazers a 40-35 lead after the Clippers had gone on an 11-2
run.</TE>
<TE>   Later, Dale Davis added another layup to account for the Trail
Blazers' five-point lead at the half. But he missed a jumper at the
buzzer or matters might have been worse for the Clippers at
intermission.</TE>
<TE>   As it was, things didn't improve to start the third quarter.
Portland scored the first six points of the second half and the
Clippers seemed out of sync at both ends of the court.</TE>
<TE>   In search of a spark, Gentry, out of options, turned to Boykins,
with McInnis on the bench with his fourth foul.</TE>

<HD>They'll Be Dealing Themselves Out</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The NBA's trade deadline is Thursday at 3 p.m. PST. For plenty of
reasons, the Clippers don't figure to be players when it comes to
wheeling and dealing.</LD>
<LD>   First and foremost, the Clippers don't have many sound players to
trade. Forward Lamar Odom had been mentioned in trade rumors last
month, but he's expected to be sidelined for at least two more weeks
because of a sprained right wrist and a sprained right ankle.</LD>
<LD>   But the Clippers also aren't looking for a quick fix. After all,
it's not as if they're one key player away from winning a title.</LD>
<TE>   "The only reason we would make a trade--and this is just me
talking--is if we would get a guy we would plug into the starting
lineup right away," Coach Alvin Gentry said. "To get a guy who might
or might not play, I don't see why we would do that.</TE>
<TE>   "We've got the future of our team right here. As coaches, we've
just got to nurture it."</TE>
<TE>   Plus, Gentry believes a minor trade might send the wrong message
in the locker room, upsetting a delicate balance among his youthful
players. The Clippers are the NBA's youngest team with an average age
of 24.8.</TE>
<TE>   "I think we've got good chemistry," he said. "I think we're
playing well right now.... I don't know why we would make a trade
unless we could get some of the guys who played last Sunday [in the
All-Star game]."</TE>
<TE>   Gentry admitted he relies on his players to tell him the truth
about the severity of their various nagging injuries. Everyone, that
is, but swingman Corey Maggette, who lists a sore left knee among his
numerous bumps and bruises.</TE>
<TE>   "He tells me he's all right even if a bone is hanging off his
leg," Gentry said of Maggette, who has sat out only three games this
season.</TE>
<TE>   Portland activated Ruben Boumtje-Boumtje, who was on the injured
list because of a sprained left ankle. The Trail Blazers put Zach
Randolph on the injured list because of a sprained right ankle.</TE>

<LD>   What: "Tales from Baseball's Golden Age"</LD>
<LD>   Author: Gene Fehler</LD>
<TE>   Publisher: Sports Publishing Inc., $19.95</TE>
<TE>   In the bare-knuckle world of 1940s and 1950s baseball, a
generation of men who had survived the Great Depression and World War
II played the game with the vigor and purpose that often seems lost
today. Gene Fehler, a South Carolina writer, compiled the best of 56
interviews with former players of the era.</TE>
<TE>   Fehler's subjects make this sentimental journey a success. In the
last years before major league baseball on the West Coast and
expansion, the images of the players such as Ted Williams and Joe
DiMaggio remain fresh to the men who played against them.</TE>
<TE>   Johnny Berardino spoke of treasuring a scar on his ankle received
when DiMaggio spiked him. Red Sox second baseman Bobby Doerr recalled
watching then unknown Williams, fresh out of high school, hit for the
first time.</TE>
<TE>   Tommy Byrne, a pitcher for the Yankees in the 1950s, fondly
recalled the chatterbox catcher, Yogi Berra, who would "talk to
(hitters) about anything. It was like he hadn't seen them in six
weeks."</TE>
<TE>   Jerry Coleman, the Yankee infielder of the 1950s, recalled the
"bad week" of pitchers he faced in the American League: "You know
what a bad week was? This was a bad week: (Virgil) Trucks, (Fred)
Hutchinson, (Hal) Newhouser, (Bob) Lemon, (Bob) Feller, (Early) Wynn,
(Mike) Garcia. We always played Detroit and Cleveland back-to-back."</TE>
<TE>   Fehler's book achieves what it sets out to do, recalling the era
in nostalgia, without the heavy hand of a historian.</TE>

<KH>DODGER REPORT</KH>
<HD>Four's a Crowd in Center</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE DIGIOVANNA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>VERO BEACH, Fla.</DL>
<LD>Tom Goodwin looked to his left and saw teammate Marquis Grissom.
Across the room was McKay Christensen. In a hallway outside the
Dodger clubhouse was Dave Roberts. Goodwin didn't have to be a
general manager to know he and the other three center fielders all
won't be around when the regular season starts.</LD>
<LD>   "They're going to weed us all out; some are staying and some will
be going," Goodwin said Monday. "This may be L.A., but it's not la-la
land. Things don't always work out best for everybody."</LD>
<LD>   Dodger Manager Jim Tracy would like a solid defensive center
fielder who could bat leadoff, an offensive sparkplug who could reach
base at a .400 clip, steal some bases and score at least 100 runs.</LD>
<TE>   "Average is not a priority, on-base percentage is," Tracy said. "I
would like for one guy to tell me, 'I want that job.'"</TE>
<TE>   Neither Grissom nor Goodwin has earned it based on last year's
performance. Grissom hit .221 with a .250 on-base percentage, and
Goodwin hit .231 with a .286 on-base percentage. The only numbers
more painful for the Dodger front office are the ones on their
contracts: Grissom is guaranteed $5 million this season, and Goodwin
will make $3.25 million.</TE>
<TE>   Christensen showed promise in 28 games last season, batting .327
with a .400 on-base percentage, but the 26-year-old has only 125
major league at-bats. Roberts, acquired from Cleveland, played in 33
big-league games last season, hitting .333.</TE>
<TE>   "There are a lot of outfielders, which is good, because we've got
to compete," Grissom said. "If you can't compete against all these
guys here, you can't compete in October."</TE>
<TE>   Grissom, 34, has the most power of the four--he had 21 home runs
and 60 runs batted in last season--but he also struck out 107 times
while drawing only 16 walks. He would enhance his chances by showing
more patience at the plate, but at this stage of his career, the
12-year veteran isn't sure he can change.</TE>
<TE>   "Last year I was slugging; I wasn't up there looking for walks,"
Grissom said. "I've always been an aggressive player, I've always
swung the bat, and you have to have confidence in your game to be
successful. I don't know if I'm a leadoff hitter, but I told [Tracy]
if that's where he needs me, that's what I'll do."</TE>
<TE>   Goodwin is one of baseball's fastest players, an asset in the
leadoff spot, but you know the old cliche: you can't steal first
base.</TE>
<TE>   "I've got to improve my bunting and my on-base percentage; I'm not
blind to that," Goodwin said. "Last year, I was thinking too much
instead of just coming out and playing the way I know I can. If
that's not good enough, we'll go our separate ways."</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers would like to package Grissom or Goodwin in a trade
for a center fielder or closer, but to do so they'll probably have to
eat a large chunk of their contracts. If Grissom or Goodwin doesn't
perform well in camp, either or both could also be released.</TE>
<TE>   "You've got to have some worth first before someone trades for
you," Goodwin said. "We didn't have good years in 2001, so why would
some other team want us?"</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Because the American Embassy in Tokyo was closed for Presidents'
Day Monday, Japanese left-hander Kazuhisa Ishii was unable to pick up
his visa until today, further delaying his arrival to Dodgertown.
Ishii, who signed a four-year, $12.2-million contract, is expected to
arrive in camp Wednesday afternoon and join in workouts Thursday.</TE>

<HD>Season Is a Test for Father-Coach at Simi Valley</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARTIN HENDERSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The playoffs ended too soon in the most memorable season of Dave
Murphy's coaching career as his Simi Valley girls lost in the first
round of the Division II-AA playoffs to Saugus, 57-38.</LD>
<LD>   But for Murphy, he wouldn't exchange this disappointing 13-14
season for anything.</LD>
<LD>   The man with the 344-201 record over 21 seasons at Simi Valley had
the opportunity to coach both his daughters, junior Joelle, a
5-foot-6 guard, and freshman Leah, a 5-5 point guard. Murphy also
coaches his youngest daughter, sixth-grader Keely, who plays for a
club team. And his wife, Jani, whom he married in 1984, was a player
he coached in his first season at Simi Valley.</LD>
<TE>   "I wouldn't trade anything I've done for coaching my wife and my
daughters," Murphy said. "It's the most special thing I've done in
sports. It's certainly not the easiest thing--it has probably been
the most difficult. But our family is very close because of our
special relationship with basketball."</TE>
<TE>   The Murphys don't talk much basketball at home during the season,
"unless there is something major," said the coach. And in season, he
avoids coaching his girls at home. But he admits there is a fine line
between being a coach, and being a parent who wants to see the best
for his children. He remembers last fall when he was driving home
with Joelle and she began telling him what another girl was saying.
"Unless it's a major issue, I don't want to hear about it," said
Murphy the coach. "You're going to have to solve the interpersonal
relationships with your teammates."</TE>
<TE>   But it's difficult not being Murphy the dad.</TE>
<TE>   "I try my hardest to keep being a father out of it," Murphy said.
"If [a daughter is] playing good, she's playing, and if she isn't,
she isn't. I've coached a long time, and in the course of a game I
know what I'm looking for. Once in awhile I get on my daughters just
like I get on anyone else. I try to treat them the same.</TE>
<TE>   "But I think it's true of any coach, that there's a special
relationship with their kids."</TE>
<TE>   Among the highlights for Simi Valley this season was the play of
Teresa Cooper, who eclipsed her sister's school career scoring
record. But otherwise, the season has been difficult. Simi Valley
expected to do better. Murphy needed 19 victories this season to
reach 350, but fell six short.</TE>
<TE>   ""We have not played up to our expectations," he said.</TE>
<TE>   But the dad wouldn't trade it for anything.</TE>
<TE>   Ouch: Dominic Evans, coach for Corona Centennial, liked what he
saw in the fourth quarter of his team's second-round Division II-AA
game at Irvine Woodbridge. Centennial was on an 8-0 run and wearing
down the Warriors.</TE>
<TE>   Then everything fell apart. Senior forward Nicole Butchko, one of
Centennial's top rebounders, got her foot caught underneath her "and
went down like a ton of bricks," Evans said. "It delayed the game for
about 15 minutes, and gave Woodbridge a chance to rest."</TE>
<TE>   Butchko, taken off the floor on a stretcher, will have further
tests on Wednesday to determine the extent of damage to her ankle. "I
talked to her mom [on Monday]," Evans said. "The doctor said it was
either broken or a twisted bone, and I'm going, 'Wow, a twisted
bone?' It wasn't pretty at all. She's a tough kid, and she screamed
something awful.</TE>
<TE>   "It hurt us in two ways--we lost our third-best rebounder, and
gave Woodbridge a chance to rest. We eventually got to 54-52, and
missed a layup and two putbacks before Woodbridge pulled away
[58-52]."</TE>
<TE>   Any last-minute heroics for Centennial were thwarted as its three
leading scorers, Michelle Strawberry, Jenna Sybesma and Erica Dotson,
who collectively averaged 42 points, fouled out.</TE>
<TE>   "So we were trying to come back without our top three scorers and
top three rebounders against a line that went 6-2, 6-2, 6-0," Evans
said. "We've had some miracle finishes before, but that was pretty
hard."</TE>

<DH>Golf: Montgomerie battling back problems, but he'll play in
La Costa match-play event.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>THOMAS BONK</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>CARLSBAD</DL>
<LD>Colin Montgomerie has been bothered by an injury to the muscles in
his lower back since December, but it must be worth it for him to
show up at La Costa this week for the Accenture Match Play
Championship.</LD>
<LD>   How do we know this? Even first-round losers get $27,500 out of
the $5.5-million purse that will be divided among 64 players.</LD>
<LD>   Only the top players in the world rankings are invited to the
party, which begins Wednesday at La Costa Resort and Spa. And for
players such as Montgomerie, who lives in England, and Ernie Els and
Retief Goosen from South Africa, Padraig Harrington from Ireland and
Michael Campbell from New Zealand, well, if it seems like a long way
to travel for the chance to play one match and go home, that's the
way it goes.</LD>
<TE>   The rules are simple: You lose, you're gone. After the opening
day, the field will be cut by half.</TE>
<TE>   Tiger Woods, the top-ranked player, is back after resting last
week instead of playing the Nissan Open. Woods' first-round opponent
is Peter O'Malley of Australia.</TE>
<TE>   Other key first-round matchups: Jose Maria Olazabal-Justin
Leonard, Montgomerie-Scott McCarron, Sergio Garcia-Lee Janzen, Paul
Azinger-Jesper Parnevik, Tom Lehman-Hal Sutton and Rocco Mediate-John
Daly.</TE>
<TE>   Woods would play the winner of the Nick Price-Angel Cabrera match
in the second round. If Garcia wins, he would play Charles Howell III
in the second round, provided Howell can defeat Stewart Cink.</TE>
<TE>   Second-ranked Phil Mickelson, who missed his last two cuts at
Pebble Beach and Torrey Pines, plays John Cook in the first round.
David Duval, who is third-ranked, plays Kevin Sutherland. Duval
withdrew from the Nissan Open after playing three holes Sunday
because of flu, but he was on the practice tee Monday afternoon at La
Costa.</TE>
<TE>   There will be a 36-hole final Sunday with the winner making $1
million and the runner-up $550,000.</TE>

<LD>A day after Samaki Walker hyperextended his elbow against the
Portland Trail Blazers, the smile had faded from the Laker backup
center's face.</LD>
<LD>   Initial X-rays taken Sunday afternoon had shown no serious damage,
leaving Walker hopeful he would be much improved by Monday. But the
elbow was swollen Monday morning, and he underwent an MRI exam Monday
afternoon.</LD>
<LD>   "It's a game-time decision," Coach Phil Jackson said of Walker's
availability for tonight.</LD>
<TE>   Walker was hurt when he locked arms with Portland's Shawn Kemp and
received a strong jolt.</TE>
<TE>   With the return of center Shaquille O'Neal tonight, Jelani McCoy
was going to be the odd man out. But if Walker's injury is deemed
more serious, he could be placed on the injured list.</TE>

<TE>   Update--Bad timing: The Celtics, playing in their fifth city in
eight days on a seven-game trip, arrive just as Laker center
Shaquille O'Neal returns from the injured list.  Boston won at Denver

Houston  left on the itinerary.</TE>

<HD>O'Neal Ready to Take Next Step</HD>
<DH>Pro basketball: Center and his arthritic big toe return
tonight against Celtics after missing five games, three of which the
Lakers lost.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE SPRINGER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The mood was somber at the Lakers' HealthSouth training center in El
Segundo on Monday. Reporters crowded around spokesman John Black as
he talked quietly about the condition of broadcaster Chick Hearn, who
is expected to undergo hip surgery today.</LD>
<LD>   But as Black spoke, one reporter after another began to look
toward the trainers' room behind them. And they began to laugh. There
in the window was Shaquille O'Neal, all 7 feet 1 and 330-something
pounds of him, dancing and gesturing with nothing on but a pair of
bright yellow shorts.</LD>
<LD>   Shaq is back, feisty and frolicking one moment, fuming and furious
the next. Back after spending five games on the injured list to rest
the arthritic big toe on his right foot. Back with a new orthotic
device in his shoe to relieve pressure. Back with anger and
determination after watching opposing teams win three of the five he
missed and show, in O'Neal's mind, a lack of respect for the two-time
defending NBA champions.</LD>
<TE>   When the Lakers and Boston Celtics tip off tonight at Staples
Center, O'Neal will be on the court, wearing considerably more than
he was Monday.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm pretty anxious to get out there," O'Neal said. "There's been
a lot of taunting, a lot of trash-talking going on. All that is going
to have to stop."</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers have lost their last two games, to the Atlanta Hawks on
Friday and the Portland Trail Blazers on Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   After Sunday's game, former Laker Ruben Patterson was vocal about
his self-defined role as the "Kobe stopper," referring to his
defensive efforts against Kobe Bryant.</TE>
<TE>   "Ruben Patterson wouldn't be saying that if I was there," O'Neal
said.</TE>
<TE>   Laker Coach Phil Jackson cautioned that there should be no
expectations O'Neal will come back in peak form.</TE>
<TE>   "Basketball-wise, he's pretty rusty," said the Laker coach, who
added with a grin, "I don't plan on playing him [tonight] one minute
longer than 40 minutes."</TE>
<TE>   Bryant assumed leadership of the team and had at least 10 assists
in three of the five games without O'Neal, but there was little
Bryant could do about the huge hole in the middle created by the
center's absence. Opposing teams often had their way around the
basket."Board-wise, we didn't stand on our own," Jackson said, "and
interior-wise, they beat us up some in the paint."</TE>
<TE>   This is not a new story. The Lakers, the league's dominant team
when O'Neal patrols the middle, struggle to stay above .500 when he
is out.</TE>
<TE>   This is the second time O'Neal has been on the injured list this
season because of the toe problem. He also missed three games when he
was suspended for fighting. The Lakers are 7-6 without him.</TE>
<TE>   Over the last four seasons, they are 13-12 without O'Neal, and
they might be without him for another stretch this season.</TE>
<TE>   Jackson won't rule out giving O'Neal another five-game break on
the injured list to rest the toe sometime before the start of the
playoffs.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't know physically how long he can go, five games or 10
games or what," Jackson said. "We'll just have to roll with it.</TE>
<TE>   "But there is a good chance we will have to [return O'Neal to the
injured list] again."</TE>
<TE>   O'Neal is realistic about his condition.</TE>
<TE>   "I should be all right," he said. "Hopefully, I won't have to
[return to the injured list], but if I have to do it again if it's
needed and we're in a position where I can do it, then I will.</TE>
<TE>   "And if we don't have the time, I will just have to suck it up."</TE>
<TE>   But on Monday, there was only optimism.</TE>
<TE>   As he walked from the court after practice to talk to reporters,
O'Neal casually flung a ball over his right shoulder to the basket
about 50 feet away.</TE>
<TE>   Nothing but net.</TE>
<TE>   "The Diesel is back," O'Neal said. "If the playoffs started today,
we would still be fine. We just have to be on our toes."</TE>
<TE>   The question is, how long can O'Neal be on his?</TE>

<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>At age 38, Karl Malone still has plenty of fun making life miserable
for opposing fans.</LD>
<LD>   Malone scored 35 points to lead the Utah Jazz to a 103-92 victory
over the Cleveland Cavaliers on Monday night at Cleveland--then poked
fun at fans who tried to disrupt his rhythm at the foul line by
hooting, hollering and waving white balloons.</LD>
<LD>   "They were vocal, but didn't cross the line," said Malone, who
bowed to fans chanting, "Karl, Karl," as he left the game with 41
seconds remaining.</LD>
<TE>   Malone dominated the second half, scoring 23 points as Utah won
its fifth straight to improve to 5-2 on its nine-game trip, forced by
the Olympics in Salt Lake City.</TE>
<TE>   Lamond Murray scored 25 points to lead the Cavaliers, who had a
season-high, four-game winning streak snapped.</TE>
<TE>   Houston 102, Washington 89--Cuttino Mobley had 31 points and Steve
Francis, questionable before the game with a migraine, scored 16 of
his 20 points in the second half as the Rockets won at Washington.
Michael Jordan had 11 points and 11 assists for the Wizards, who had
won four straight at home and six of eight overall.</TE>
<TE>   Jordan also revealed afterward that he will have another fluid
buildup in his right knee drained and will miss Wednesday's game at
Detroit. He missed a game earlier at San Antonio for the same reason.</TE>
<TE>   Philadelphia 110, Denver 83--Playing on a sprained toe, Allen
Iverson had 27 points, nine rebounds and eight assists and Dikembe
Mutombo scored 20 points on nine-for-nine shooting to lead the 76ers
at Philadelphia. The 76ers broke a two-game losing streak.</TE>
<TE>   Charlotte 101, Milwaukee 92--Jamal Mashburn, who had been out
since Nov. 20 because of an abdominal strain, returned to the lineup
and scored 22 points to lead the Hornets at Milwaukee. The Bucks lost
for the ninth time in 12 games.</TE>
<TE>   Detroit 89, Toronto 76--Jerry Stackhouse scored 20 points for the
Pistons at Auburn Hills, Mich. The Pistons (29-22) have won three
straight and nine of 11 and Toronto has lost five straight since
Vince Carter went on the injured list because of a quadriceps strain.</TE>
<TE>   Miami 102, Chicago 80--Alonzo Mourning scored 23 points for the
Heat at Miami.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Indiana's Reggie Miller and Philadelphia's Derrick Coleman and Corie
Blount were suspended by the NBA on Monday for their roles in an
altercation.</LD>
<LD>   Miller was suspended for one game and fined $7,500 for throwing a
punch at Coleman in the third quarter of the Pacers' 86-76 win over
the 76ers on Sunday.</LD>
<LD>   Coleman was suspended for two games and fined $12,500 for grabbing
Miller's throat and throwing a punch. Blount received an automatic
one-game suspension and was fined $5,000 for leaving the vicinity of
the bench during the altercation.</LD>
<TE>   Also Monday, Charlotte guard Baron Davis was fined $7,500 for
verbally abusing officials in the Hornets' 92-78 loss to Memphis on
Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Milwaukee Buck point guard Sam Cassell didn't dress for Monday's
game against the Charlotte Hornets because of a sprained toe.</TE>
<TE>   Cassell played 35 minutes in a 91-86 victory at Toronto on Sunday
and couldn't make the quick turnaround. He was replaced Monday's
starting lineup by Rafer Alston.</TE>
<TE>   "He didn't do anything at shoot-around today and he's hurting,"
Milwaukee Coach George Karl said.</TE>
<TE>   Cassell said Sunday that he was going to be selective about future
games so that he's healthy for the playoffs.</TE>
<TE>   "I'd rather take care of it now," said Cassell, who missed the
previous two games.</TE>
<TE>   Cassell said he would need three weeks to heal.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Phoenix Suns hired Al Bianchi as an assistant coach.</TE>
<TE>   Bianchi's new job comes a day after Frank Johnson replaced Scott
Skiles as the team's head coach.</TE>
<TE>   Skiles stepped down as coach of the Suns, who are 25-27 and in
danger of missing the NBA playoffs for the first time since 1988.</TE>
<TE>   Bianchi, a college scout for the Suns the last nine seasons,
served as a Phoenix assistant coach from 1975-1987. He was a head
coach twice, for Seattle in the late 1960s and for the ABA's Virginia
Squires from 1969-1975.</TE>
<TE>   Bianchi, who will turn 70 in March, was the general manager of the
New York Knicks from 1987-1991.</TE>
<TE>   He also played 10 years in the NBA with the Syracuse Nationals and
the Philadelphia 76ers.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Philadelphia 76ers activated center Jabari Smith before
Monday's game against Denver. To make room for Smith, Philadelphia
put forward Derrick McKey on the injured list.... The Cleveland
Cavaliers put guard Bimbo Coles on the injured list and activated
Trajan Langdon for Monday's game against Utah.</TE>

<LD>The American women, gold-medal winners in the Nagano hockey
tournament, are easily on pace to repeat in Salt Lake City. But to do
so, they have to get past 2-1 Sweden, the second-place team in the
other group, in the semifinals. That probably would set up a
gold-medal match against U.S. archrival Canada, which faces Finland
in the other semifinal.</LD>
<LD>   The United States outshot three opponents in 10-0, 12-1 and 5-0
victories in the preliminaries by the amazing total of 175-39. The
most glaring loss in U.S. women's hockey history came at the hands of
Canada in last year's world championships in the gold-medal game.</LD>

<HD>Germans Recover, Win Women's 30K</HD>
<DH></DH>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>MIDWAY, Utah</DL>
<LD>Thanks to Uschi Disl's strong skiing and Andrea Henkel's precise
shooting, Germany confirmed its status as the world's best women's
biathlon team.</LD>
<LD>   Quickly making up time after a bad first leg, the favored Germans
won their second consecutive gold medal in the 30-kilometer relay
Monday.</LD>
<LD>   By the time anchor Kati Wilhelm finished her 7.5-kilometer
portion, the early mistakes by teammate Katrin Apel had been long
forgotten, as Germany completed the Soldier Hollow course in 1 hour
27 minutes 55 seconds. Norway won the silver, finishing 30.6 seconds
back. Russia held off Bulgaria for the bronze, 1 minute 24.7 seconds
behind.</LD>
<TE>   "I thought that the gold was gone because of me," Apel said. "But
in the end it went well, and gold is gold."</TE>
<TE>   Apel missed four shots on her second shooting stage, dropping her
team to 12th place. She moved up to sixth by the time she tapped Disl
on the back to start the second leg. Disl was the fastest skier on
the course, and when she gave way to Henkel, Germany was back in
front by 21.2 seconds.</TE>
<TE>   Henkel wrapped up the victory by hitting all 10 targets with her
.22-caliber rifle, boosting the lead to a commanding 38.6 seconds. "</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. team of Andrea Nahrgang, Kara Salmela, Rachel Steer and
Kristina Sabasteanski ended a disappointing Olympics by finishing
last among the 15-team field.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think any of us would tell you that we came here just to
race," Steer said. "This was our last chance, and we didn't want to
have a bad experience."</TE>
<TE>   Wilhelm became the first woman at the Salt Lake Games with three
medals; she won the sprint last week and finished second in the
pursuit. Henkel, just 21, won gold in the 15-kilometer race. And
Disl, competing in her fourth Olympics, won her eighth career medal,
extending her record for the women's sport.</TE>
<TE>   Russia was regarded as the only team with a real chance of beating
the Germans, but Galina Koukleva's erratic shooting on the second leg
removed any chance for the gold.</TE>
<TE>   "I think my shooting was outright horrible today," Koukleva said.
"I define biathlon as nerves, nerves, nerves. It was a nerve-racking
experience. I guess that was obvious."</TE>
<TE>   Under the rules, each biathlete fires twice, the first time prone
and the second from the more difficult standing position. They get
eight bullets to hit make five targets, but if they go through the
first five in their clips, they must load each bullet individually
after that. For each of the black circular targets left standing, the
skier must circle a 150-meter penalty loop.</TE>

<HD>Critics Grate on Gretzky</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>J.A. ADANDE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WEST VALLEY CITY, Utah</DL>
<LD>When Canada and the Czech Republic skated to a tie in the Olympics
four years ago, the Czechs won in a shootout.</LD>
<LD>   Because Monday's matchup wasn't an elimination game, there was no
shootout after the teams finished with a 3-3 tie at the E Center. But
the Canadian brass came out firing in the postgame news conference.</LD>
<LD>   General Manager Wayne Gretzky railed against media criticism of
his team, questioned the officiating on the ice and was especially
outraged by a cross-check by Roman Hamrlik on Canada's Theo Fleury in
the waning moments of the game that wasn't called a penalty. Both
Gretzky and Canada Coach Pat Quinn implied that it would be open
season on Hamrlik once NHL play resumes.</LD>
<TE>   "Am I hot? Yeah, I'm hot," Gretzky said. "I'm tired of people
taking shots at Canadian hockey.</TE>
<TE>   "When we do it [act physically], we're hooligans. When Europeans
do it, it's OK. That's a bunch of...."</TE>
<TE>   Hamrlik, who had minor brushes with Eric Lindros and Ryan Smith
earlier in the game, nailed Fleury after he untangled from Czech
goalie Dominik Hasek. Gretzky said Hamrlik should be suspended for
the rest of the tournament.</TE>
<TE>   The Canadians complained that it was the type of dirty play that
the Canadians used to be criticized for and pined for the vigilante
justice of the NHL.</TE>
<TE>   "In our game, if someone does something dirty to you, you respond
right away, you beat the ... out of them, whatever it is," Quinn
said. "We've talked to our guys, they're showing the discipline--and
they're having to take it. That's the cheese-off of it.</TE>
<TE>   "The one nice thing is [before NHL players participated in the
Olympics] we had to take those lumps and never could get payback
time. But guess what? One week from now, we get all the payback we
want."</TE>
<TE>   Said Gretzky: "Now they've got to answer the fiddler."</TE>
<TE>   Gretzky had plenty more. He teed off when a reporter asked him
about reported player grumblings about Quinn, calling that: "American
propaganda."</TE>
<TE>   To hear Gretzky tell it, the story of the Games might as well be
called, "Woe, Canada" after the beatings the Canadians took following
their 5-2 loss to Sweden in the first game.</TE>
<TE>   Never mind that the American media seemed fixated on the 1980
"Miracle on Ice" U.S. team, not to mention the current U.S. team's
strong start.</TE>
<TE>   "If you want to talk about hockey, you're going to talk about the
Canadians," Gretzky said. "We're the biggest story in hockey.</TE>
<TE>   "Now they've got two Canadian stories: figure skaters and the
hockey team. It's such a crock....</TE>
<TE>   "Nobody wants us to win but our own players. People don't
understand the pressure these guys are under....</TE>
<TE>   "We're still here. We're still standing."</TE>
<TE>   It took a goal by Joe Nieuwendyk with 3:24 remaining in the third
just to get Canada a tie.</TE>
<TE>   Although they outshot the Czechs by a 2-1 ratio for most of the
game, the Canadians' inability to clear the puck out of their zone
allowed the Czechs to get their three goals--two by Martin Havlat.</TE>
<TE>   Mario Lemieux scored two goals for Canada. On his second, Hasek
caught the puck against his left side, then fell backward, with part
of his body crossing the goal line. The red goal light went on, but
the officials called for a video review. The goal stood.</TE>
<TE>   Szymon Szemberg, the media relations manager for the International
Ice Hockey Federation, said the play was reviewed again after the
game and the tape resolved three major issues.</TE>
<TE>   "First, you could clearly see the puck entering the glove,"
Szemberg said. "The puck was in the glove. Two, you could clearly see
the momentum that carried Dominik Hasek backwards brought the puck
over the line. Three, he was not pushed."</TE>
<TE>   When asked what he thought about the play, Czech Coach Josef
Augusta playfully replied: "What do you think about it?" then dropped
it, saying: "There will be no more speculation. I think it was a
goal."</TE>
<TE>   Gretzky, in full attack mode, couldn't keep his answer as simple.</TE>
<TE>   "It was clearly a goal," he said. "There was nothing to review.</TE>
<TE>   "They couldn't skate with us in the third period, they should have
had four or five penalties--hooking, tripping."</TE>
<TE>   Canada and the Czech Republic finished with 1-1-1 records, but the
Czechs had a better goal differential and will be seeded second from
Group C with a quarterfinal matchup against Russia. The Canadians
will face Finland in the quarterfinals.</TE>

<HD>No Doubt for French</HD>

<DL>SALT LAKE CITY</DL>
<LD>Another figure skating gold medal was decided by a 5-4 margin Monday.
But unlike the controversial pairs final, the ice dance final stirred
no complaints about judging conspiracies at the Salt Lake Ice Center.</LD>
<LD>   Marina Anissina and Gwendal Peizerat of France, whose "Liberta"
free dance program contained excerpts from Martin Luther King Jr.'s
"I Have a Dream" speech, edged Irina Lobacheva and Ilia Averbukh of
Russia to win the first Olympic ice dance gold medal awarded to
French athletes.</LD>
<LD>   It was France's third figure skating gold and its first since
1932, when Andree and Pierre Brunet won the second of two successive
Olympic pairs titles.</LD>
<TE>   It also marked the first time since the memorable "Bolero"
performance by Great Britain's Jayne Torvill and Christopher Dean in
1984 that a non-Russian couple prevailed in Olympic ice dancing
competition.</TE>
<TE>   "I feel like it's [a] historic day," Peizerat said, "and I feel
very proud of having been able to come up here and do this."</TE>
<TE>   Defending world champions Barbara Fusar Poli and Maurizio
Margaglio of Italy won the bronze medal despite a hard fall by
Margaglio on a diagonal step sequence about 90 seconds into the
program.</TE>
<TE>   "At that moment, you have all your life crossing in front of your
eyes," Margaglio said after he and his partner became the first
Italian skaters to win an Olympic figure skating medal. "You don't
know whether to be proud that you continued the program, or sad."</TE>
<TE>   Fusar Poli chose the second option, sobbing as the couple finished
and again in the kiss-and-cry area while awaiting the couple's marks.</TE>
<TE>   Anissina and Peizerat were ranked first by judges from Lithuania,
Azerbaijan, Bulgaria, Ukraine and Poland, winning three tiebreakers
because of their superior technical scores. Lobacheva and Averbukh
won the judges from Russia, Switzerland, Germany and Italy.</TE>
<TE>   Nonetheless, the Russian couple was happy. Averbukh even exchanged
greetings with the Russia-born Anissina, his partner until he fell in
love with and married Lobacheva.</TE>
<TE>   "The silver medal is a dream," Averbukh said. "Just one month ago
before, we were third place in the European championships [behind
Anissina and Peizerat, and Fusar Poli and Margaglio]. Four judges
gave us first. It was wonderful."</TE>
<TE>   Shae-Lynn Bourne and Victor Kraatz of Canada, who tumbled out of
their final lift, finished fourth. It was strangely similar to the
fall taken by Canadian pair skaters Jamie Sale and David Pelletier at
the end of their short program, and like Pelletier, Bourne kissed the
ice. "I thought it was the best skate we'd ever done," she said. "At
the last second, we let it go. It's too bad, because we might have
had a bronze. You always have to believe the chance is there."</TE>
<TE>   Believing in the Easter bunny would have taken them just as far:
The order of the top eight couples never changed from the first
compulsory dance through the free dance, which was worth 50% of the
final score.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. champions Naomi Lang and Peter Tchernyshev were 11th, two
places lower than they finished at last year's world championships.
However, they were not discouraged. "This was my first time in the
Olympics, and everything seemed to come together," Tchernyshev said.</TE>
<TE>   Lang acknowledged being disappointed with their scores--which
ranged from 5.1 to 5.4 for technical merit and 5.3 to 5.5 for
presentation--but she reveled in the crowd's affection.</TE>
<TE>   "We're always winners with the crowd," she said. "We did the best
performances we could."</TE>

<HD>Reform Measures Could Make History of the 6.0</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Figure skating's perfect mark of 6.0 dates to at least 1892, the year
the International Skating Union was founded.</LD>
<LD>   At the time, compulsory figures were traced on the ice three times
with one skate, then three times with the other. Judges scored every
tracing, awarding a maximum of a point for each one. Therefore, a
maximum of six points was given for each figure.</LD>
<LD>   The scale has evolved, but the system's value has not. Skaters
start with a 6.0, and deductions are taken for missed elements or
mistakes.</LD>
<TE>   The first Olympic figure skating competition took place at the
1908 Summer Games in London. The Winter Olympics began in 1924 in
Chamonix, France.</TE>
<TE>   Here's how the scoring system in figure skating compares with the
proposal from International Skating Union President Ottavio
Cinquanta. The ISU Congress must approve the plan.</TE>
<TE>   The Current System</TE>
<TE>   * Nine judges utilize a 6.0 scoring system, in which each skater
begins with a base mark of 6.0 and deductions are made for mistakes,
missed elements and the judge's assessment of the aesthetics.</TE>
<TE>   Reform Proposal</TE>
<TE>   * Replace the traditional 6.0 scoring system with a system that
would give points for each technical element (i.e. jumps, spins,
footwork), the difficulty of the elements and their execution.</TE>
<TE>   * Fourteen judges, rather than nine, would be used, but only the
scores from seven of them would count. A computer system would
randomly select the seven marks.</TE>
<TE>   * Winner would be determined by highest point total.</TE>

<DH>One of Finest Women's Fields Begins Competition in Figure
Skating's Centerpiece Today</DH>

<DL>SALT LAKE CITY</DL>
<LD>It doesn't matter now that Michelle Kwan doesn't have a coach to sit
beside her in the kiss-and-cry area.</LD>
<LD>   Or that Russians Maria Butyrskaya and Irina Slutskaya endured
inconsistent seasons.</LD>
<LD>   Forget, too, Sarah Hughes' flutzes and Sasha Cohen's unsuccessful
attempts to land a quadruple jump.</LD>
<TE>   What matters is the way these women perform during the most
pressure-packed 6 1/2 minutes of their lives: the 2 1/2 minutes of
their short programs today at the Salt Lake Ice Center, and the
4-plus minutes of their long programs Thursday, which will determine
the women's Olympic figure skating champion.</TE>
<TE>   Kwan, the four-time world champion and six-time U.S. champion, has
history on her side as she pursues the gold medal she was favored to
win four years ago at Nagano but narrowly lost to compatriot Tara
Lipinski.</TE>
<TE>   For starters, the 21-year-old Torrance native is the reigning
women's world champion, and each of the last four women's gold
medalists had won the world title the year before her Olympic
triumph. Katarina Witt of East Germany began the streak by winning
the 1987 world championship and the 1988 gold medal at Calgary. Next
was Kristi Yamaguchi of the U.S., the 1991 world champion and 1992
Olympic gold medalist at Albertville.</TE>
<TE>   Oksana Baiul of Ukraine won her only world title in 1993 and won
gold at the 1994 Lillehammer Games, and Lipinski won her lone world
championship in 1997 and followed by upsetting Kwan with an exuberant
and technically demanding long program at the Nagano Games.</TE>
<TE>   Also, at least one U.S. woman has won a medal at the last nine
Olympics, since Peggy Fleming triumphed at Grenoble in 1968.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. women were last shut out in 1964, three years after a
plane crash had killed the U.S. team en route to the world
championships.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. women's delegation at Salt Lake City is considered
perhaps the best ever to compete at the Olympics, and for good
reasons.</TE>
<TE>   The leader, of course, is Kwan, who has two runner-up finishes at
the world competition in addition to her four titles and her Nagano
Olympic silver medal. After a tumultuous season in which she parted
with longtime coach Frank Carroll and lost to Slutskaya and Hughes at
Skate Canada, she seemed to right herself in winning the U.S.
championship. And she has been far more relaxed in Salt Lake City
than she was at Nagano, where a foot injury kept her from
participating in the opening ceremony and a fear of illness kept her
out of the Olympic Village.</TE>
<TE>   Kwan has soaked up the entire Olympic experience this time,
marching in the opening ceremony, meeting other athletes and loving
every minute as she prepares for what she called "a great moment in
my life."</TE>
<TE>   To be a golden moment, though, she will have to rise to the
challenge of pulling off a triple-triple combination jump, which she
hasn't landed this season. She plans to do a triple toe loop-triple
toe loop combination in her "Sheherezade" long program, her most
reliable triple-triple, and is contemplating adding another
triple-triple if she needs the points on her technical scores.</TE>
<TE>   "The triple toe-triple toe is getting better," she said this week.
"I don't know if I'll do a triple lutz-triple loop. Looking at the
men, I start thinking, 'Why don't I throw in another triple? Maybe a
quad?'"</TE>
<TE>   She was joking, but the ability to land a triple-triple could
prove decisive.</TE>
<TE>   And Hughes, the poised 16-year-old from Great Neck, N.Y., who was
third at last year's world championships, is planning two
triple-triples in her "Daphnis et Chloe" long program.</TE>
<TE>   Hughes and coach Robin Wagner have revised her program since the
U.S. championships to add punch and more difficult elements. They
also edited their excerpts of Ravel's music to find a more dramatic
ending.</TE>
<TE>   "It adds a little more vibrance and shows off a little more her
line, graceful quality and quickness," Wagner said. "It gives her
something new to work on, some freshness."</TE>
<TE>   Then there's Cohen, the fiery 17-year-old from Laguna Niguel. She
has never competed at the world championships, but her balletic grace
and riveting performances at the U.S. championships suggest she can
compete with her more experienced rivals.</TE>
<TE>   "The three ladies are wonderful," said John Nicks, Cohen's coach.</TE>
<TE>   Can they sweep the medals, a feat accomplished in Olympic figure
skating only by the U.S. men's trio of Hayes Alan Jenkins, Ronnie
Robertson and David Jenkins at the 1956 Games? The home crowd, which
has been passionate in its support of U.S. athletes throughout these
Games, will certainly be on their side.</TE>
<TE>   "Anything is possible," Nicks said.</TE>
<TE>   Butyrskaya, 29, could also be a factor. She was the 1999 world
champion but finished third and fourth the next two years; she staged
something of a comeback by winning the Nations Cup and Trophee
Lalique Grand Prix events as well as the European title, but she lost
to Slutskaya at the Russian championships.</TE>
<TE>   Slutskaya, 23, is Kwan's chief rival and the most likely obstacle
to a U.S. medals sweep.</TE>
<TE>   The Moscow native, shaken when Kwan rallied in the long program to
defeat her at last year's world championships, has always been solid
technically. She has spent the past year working on her musicality
and ever-so-subjective presentation skills--as well as her English.</TE>
<TE>   "I work so hard on my artistic marks," she said. "My first marks
[for technique] are good. My second marks were smaller than the
first. I just try to do better and better."</TE>
<TE>   Slutskaya defeated Kwan at the Goodwill Games in September and at
the Masters of Figure Skating in October, but lost to Hughes at Skate
Canada. She won the Cup of Russia title in November, but didn't skate
well; her victory over Kwan at December's Grand Prix Final was less
than convincing too. She followed that by winning the Russian
national competition but fell twice in finishing second to Butyrskaya
at the European championships.</TE>
<TE>   "I was a little surprised on one side," she said of her subpar
performance at the European competition. "But on the second side, I
was tired. I was surprised I fall on the triple flip....The
newspapers in Russia, they try to explain to people my problems.
'Irina lost the European title, and this is the end, the end of her
career, the end of everything.'"</TE>
<TE>   Slutskaya also said she hopes the anti-Russian sentiment that she
said factored into the disputed pairs competition won't affect her
too. Russians Elena Berezhnaya and Anton Sikharulidze were
steamrolled by public opinion, while Canadians Jamie Sale and David
Pelletier were favored, she said.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't want to say Americans don't like me too," she said. "It
doesn't matter where you skate, it matters how you skate."</TE>

<HD>Camplin Enjoys Spoonful of Gold</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BONNIE DeSIMONE</AU>
<BD>TRIBUNE OLYMPIC BUREAU</BD>
<DL>PARK CITY, Utah</DL>
<LD>Alisa Camplin measures her life in wooden spoons. The pint-sized
Australian sticks the utensils into the snow to mark her launching
point for aerial stunts she performs 50 feet in the air, perilous
flights whose landings aren't cushioned by hydraulics.</LD>
<LD>   Like many aerial skiers, Camplin, 27, came to the sport by way of
gymnastics. She didn't start skiing until she was 19, and her first
training jumps were made into a scummy pond filled with leeches.</LD>
<LD>   Her comrade in the muck, Jacqui Cooper, was one of the favorites
going into the Olympics, but the three-time world champion blew out
her knee in training three days after the opening ceremonies. Monday,
the unheralded Camplin flipped and twisted her way to first place,
doubling her country's all-time Winter Olympics gold-medal count on
the heels of short-track speedskater Steven Bradbury's victory.</LD>
<TE>   The 5-foot-2, 106-pound Camplin, her sunny smile framed by a pair
of thick blonde braids and her shoulders draped with the Australian
flag, gestured to the two Canadians who earlier had flanked her in
the flower ceremony and declared the three of them "the dorkiest
girls on the [World Cup] tour."</TE>
<TE>   "We never go out," Camplin said of herself, silver medalist
Veronica Brenner and third-place finisher Deidra Dionne. "People make
fun of us. We stay in, we read books, two a week. It pays to be
smart, and this is a very smart podium.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm almost pleased that I didn't have [Bradbury's] pressure.
That's a big thing our nation has been trying to chase."</TE>
<TE>   Camplin was third going into the last jump Monday. She nailed a
back full/double full--a back twisting flip followed by another back
flip with two twists--to take the lead. The Canadians, who jumped
before her, did tricks of equal difficulty.</TE>
<TE>   Russian Olga Koroleva had the highest score off the first jump but
later did an easier double-twisting back flip and wound up fourth.
Perhaps encouraged by the judge-bashing that has permeated the Salt
Lake City Games, she complained that her scores were "lower than what
I deserve."</TE>
<TE>   "Mostly, I think the judging was biased in the qualification
competition," Koroleva said.</TE>
<TE>   No U.S. woman made the field of 12 finalists. Top U.S. hope Emily
Cook, who crashed in training last month just after being selected to
the Olympic team, is recovering from foot surgery and watched the
event from a wheelchair.</TE>
<TE>   Camplin spoke to reporters while clutching a small toy sheep that
has been her good-luck charm at Salt Lake City. Given the sport's
risks, superstition is forgivable.</TE>
<TE>   Camplin has had nine concussions and several broken bones, and
jumped Monday only a month after bruising her ankles and suffering
stress fractures in her heels.</TE>
<TE>   She was unable to eat Sunday night, she said, and slept only after
downing a cup of chamomile tea and talking to her sports psychologist
for an hour.</TE>
<TE>   "This year my big improvement was in my mental skills, keeping my
mind on the job at hand," Camplin said.</TE>

<DL>SALT LAKE CITY</DL>
<LD>Buy stock in asterisks.</LD>
<LD>   Every record book that includes figure skating results in the
future is going to be filled with them. Peggy Fleming's gold medal in
1968? * Dorothy Hamill's gold medal in 1976? * The Torvill &amp; Dean
gold medal in 1984? * Brian Boitano's gold medal in 1988? * The pairs
gold medal in Salt Lake City? **</LD>
<LD>   The gold medal about to be won here in women's figure skating by
Michelle Kwan, Irina Slutskaya, Sasha Cohen or someone else? Yes,
still another *.</LD>
<TE>   I'm not saying that skaters winning medals in the last 120
years--the first figure skating competition on record occurred in
1882--didn't deserve them. If you had a Dorothy Hamill haircut in the
'70s, you don't have to feel guilty. Jack in the Box doesn't have to
pull its Brian Boitano ads.</TE>
<TE>   I'm not saying that the woman crowned Olympic champion Thursday
night at the Salt Lake Ice Center won't be the best.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, I'm not saying anything.</TE>
<TE>   It was the International Skating Union, which governs figure
skating, that said Monday that its age-old system of determining
winners and losers is sometimes corrupt and always corruptible.</TE>
<TE>   In an incredible news conference after a meeting of the 11-member
ISU Council, the federation's president, Ottavio Cinquanta of Italy,
all but confessed that the scoring system--nine judges scoring
skaters from a range of 0.0 to 6.0 for both technical merit and
presentation--is infested with bias. He mentioned bloc voting
specifically, suggesting that the old cold warriors never die. They
just rig figure skating contests.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   So what does the ISU do about it?</TE>
<TE>   I've heard numerous suggestions for reform in the week since the
start of the monster pairs controversy that ate the Salt Lake City
Olympics, but none more radical than the one proposed Monday in a
unanimous vote by the ISU.</TE>
<TE>   Cinquanta's news conference produced more questions than answers.
But the clear impression he left was that this proposal is a work in
progress that will be further debated and defined before a vote of
the ISU Congress in June.</TE>
<TE>   The plan, as I understand it, is that future judging panels would
be composed of 14 members instead of nine. The scores of only seven
of them, randomly selected by a computer, would be counted.</TE>
<TE>   A skater would start his program with zero. Each element he
performs would be worth a certain number of points. He would receive
bonus points depending on how well he performed the element.</TE>
<TE>   For example, a triple salchow landed might be worth 3 points. If
it is done poorly, there might be no bonus. If it is average, it
might be worth 1 bonus point. If it is excellent, it might be worth 2
extra points. There would be a similar scoring system for spins,
laybacks and footwork in singles and throws and lifts in pairs. (No
one would still be able to figure out how ice dancing should be
judged.)</TE>
<TE>   The system would not eliminate subjectivity, because it would be
up to each judge to determine how well he or she believes an element
is performed. But there would be a 50-50 chance of eliminating a
biased judge and a 100% chance of eliminating bloc voting because no
judge would be able to guarantee his or her scores would count.</TE>
<TE>   At the end of the day, the skater with the most points would win.</TE>
<TE>   Cinquanta suggested that it might create even more interest in the
sport because it would create records. For instance, you might see
this kind of story from Turin, Italy, in 2006:</TE>
<TE>   "Nailing a quadruple salchow-triple toe-double toe combination
with only three seconds remaining in his freestyle program, Timothy
Goebel of the United States won the Olympic men's gold medal Thursday
night with a world-record score of 8361/2 points."</TE>
<TE>   In other words, figure skating would be a sport.</TE>
<TE>   But would it be better?</TE>
<TE>   That is unclear.</TE>
<TE>   One thing separating figure skating from other judged disciplines
such as gymnastics, diving and boxing is that beauty counts. In the
freestyle programs for singles and pairs, presentation scores--the
bottom marks, below the row of technical scores--are the tiebreakers.</TE>
<TE>   Figure skating's caretakers have decided it should be thus because
they want to assure that the athletes--don't even question the use of
that word, because they are great athletes--concentrate as much,
maybe even a little more, on the aesthetics of their programs as they
do on the tricks.</TE>
<TE>   It has been a difficult balance to maintain. Those who lean toward
the technical side of the sport were satisfied in 1992, when
Ukrainian high jumper Viktor Petrenko edged American Paul Wylie for
the gold medal.</TE>
<TE>   The pendulum, however, had swung back by 1994, when the
ballerina-like Oksana Baiul of Ukraine beat Nancy Kerrigan of the
United States.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps that side is too far ahead now. Since her flat,
third-place performance in the U.S. championships at Staples Center,
Sarah Hughes, until very recently, didn't feel the necessity to
enhance the difficulty of her programs. She has, at the insistence of
judges, changed her hairstyle and dresses.</TE>
<TE>   But figure skating should retain its emphasis on art so that it
doesn't become gymnastics on</TE>
<TE>   ice.</TE>
<TE>   Cinquanta didn't address how, or even if, the ISU proposal might
achieve that. He seemed unsure whether presentation would be scored
as just another element or as an important element.</TE>
<TE>   But there were a number of things Cinquanta didn't address.</TE>
<TE>   I would give him a 5.2 for details and a 4.9 for presentation.</TE>

<HD>Finland Cuts Down Powerful Russia, 3-1</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>PROVO, Utah</DL>
<LD>Russia became the latest hockey superpower to learn a lesson of
international play that has been taught repeatedly in recent years.</LD>
<LD>   Never forget about Finland.</LD>
<LD>   Captain Teemu Selanne scored the first of three consecutive goals
and Finland surprised Russia, 3-1, Monday to clinch second place in
its Olympic hockey group.</LD>
<TE>   Mikko Eloranta and Jere Lehtinen scored for the Finns, who
continued their long tradition of countering their talent
disadvantages with workmanlike play, conservative defense and flashes
of offensive brilliance, mostly from Selanne.</TE>
<TE>   After being dominated in the final two periods, the mighty
Russians were knocked to third place in the group. Once again,
Finland has become a surprise medal contender.</TE>
<TE>   "We let other teams do the commentating and the handicapping and
the head games," defenseman Teppo Numminen said. "We don't do that.
We just play, and not worry about what happens next. We know we've
got nothing to lose."</TE>
<TE>   Finland, the only nation to win a medal in each of the last two
Olympics and four World Championships, rebounded from a 6-0 loss to
the United States in its opener to win two in a row.</TE>
<TE>   Finland's bronze performance at Nagano was overshadowed by the
Czech Republic's heroics and disappointing performances by the United
States and Canada. Given the absence of star Saku Koivu, who's
battling cancer, not much was expected of the current
team--particularly after the blowout loss Friday.</TE>
<TE>   But Finland's patient, defense-oriented style produced strong
games against Belarus and Russia. Finland also got strong goaltending
from Jani Hurme, who stopped 25 shots and held on against a Russian
rally in the final minutes.</TE>
<TE>   "I think we wanted to win this more than those guys," Selanne
said. "They're pretty scary with that lineup, so it was good they
didn't show up tonight."</TE>
<TE>   Pavel Bure scored for the Russians (1-1-1), who have scored only
three goals in their last six periods despite a high-powered roster
that includes seven players who have scored at least 29 goals in an
NHL season.</TE>
<TE>   Sweden 7, Germany 1--Markus Naslund scored two goals, and captain
Mats Sundin had a goal and two assists as Sweden, which had already
clinched a top quarterfinal seeding, rolled to its third consecutive
victory.</TE>
<TE>   Backup goalie Johan Hedberg stopped 19 shots, losing his shutout
bid during a power play with 1:59 left, as Sweden prepared for its
quarterfinal match against Belarus with a performance that often
resembled a scrimmage for the smooth Swedes.</TE>
<TE>   Germany, 0-3 in the final round, will face the United States in
the quarterfinals.</TE>

<LD>Men don't flutz--not much, anyway.</LD>
<LD>   Flutzing, for those new to figure skating, occurs when a skater
plans a lutz jump but takes off on the wrong edge of the blade.
Technically, that turns the jump into a flip or a hybrid of "flip"
and "lutz"--a flutz.</LD>
<LD>   Flutzing is difficult for a casual viewer to discern, but it is
instantly recognizable to skating purists.</LD>
<TE>   The lutz is probably the easiest jump to identify: It's the one
skaters usually launch after a long approach, a look over the
shoulder to be sure there's room to jump, turn and land, and a
noticeable dig into the ice with the toe pick. The takeoff is from
the back outside edge of one blade, and the landing is supposed to be
on the back outside edge of the opposite foot.</TE>
<TE>   However, some skaters cheat and instead take off from the back
inside edge of the blade. That takeoff makes the jump a flip, which
is less difficult because the entry curve of the flip and the
direction of the spin in the air are the same. In the lutz, there's a
reversal of direction from the entry curve into the spin.</TE>
<TE>   Sarah Hughes, the third-place finisher at last month's U.S.
championships, undoubtedly lost points for technique in her short
program because she flutzed. However, she appears to have corrected
her flawed takeoff in time for the Winter Games.</TE>
<TE>   Flutzing is fairly common among female skaters yet is almost never
seen among men. Probably the key reason female skaters are prone to
flutzing is physiology: Men are simply more muscular, and that helps
them stay on the outside edge on the takeoff of a lutz and avoid the
tendency to lean toward the inside edge and flutz.</TE>
<TE>   "When you go into a jump, you use upper-body strength to gather
momentum and to spin," said Gerri Walbert, editor of the figure
skating publication Blades on Ice and a longtime figure skating
observer. "You use your shoulders to uplift as you pull in your arms.
Men have the strength to do that, and women don't."</TE>

<HD>Belarus Athlete Tests Positive</HD>

<DL>SALT LAKE CITY</DL>
<LD>A sample provided by a Belarussian athlete tested positive for the
muscle-building steroid nandrolone at 380 times the admissible level,
the International Olympic Committee said Monday in announcing that it
had excluded a key Belarus official from the Games and cut off
funding after the athlete failed to appear for a follow-up test.</LD>
<LD>   The name of the athlete was not immediately disclosed. Sources
identified her as a speedskater and said she did not qualify for an
Olympic final at the Salt Lake City Games. Her whereabouts late
Monday were not known.</LD>
<LD>   A urine sample she provided after being chosen at random for
testing showed the elevated nandrolone levels, officials said Monday
night. But the result is not technically being considered a positive
doping case because of a significant procedural irregularity--the bag
in which the sample was being carried was not properly sealed when it
arrived at an Olympic testing lab set up here for the Games.</LD>
<TE>   Only five drug cases have been confirmed in Winter Games history,
none the past three Games. Urine samples are put through a variety of
tests designed to detect narcotics, stimulants, steroids, beta
blockers, diuretics and other substances. In all, the IOC bans about
400 substances.</TE>
<TE>   The IOC demanded that the athlete appear Monday for a follow-up
test. She did not show.</TE>
<TE>   A "very strange disappearance," the IOC's chief operating officer,
Francois Carrard, said late Monday, adding that the IOC believes she
is still in the United States and perhaps "might not be so far from
here."</TE>
<TE>   IOC President Jacques Rogge "expressly invited" Yaroslav Barichko,
Belarus' team leader, to explain, according to Carrard. He did not
show.</TE>
<TE>   In response, the IOC's policy-making executive board banned
Barichko for the duration of the Games and suspended financial
support to Belarus' national Olympic committee for the rest of 2002.</TE>
<TE>   In all, about $120,000 went to Belarus last year. The money was
supplied both by the IOC directly and through an IOC support agency
called Olympic Solidarity.</TE>
<TE>   Other Belarussian athletes are still permitted to compete at the
Games, Carrard said. He said it would be "totally unfair" to penalize
the other athletes. Belarus sent 66 athletes to the Games.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Apolo Anton Ohno skated Monday for the first time since cutting
his left leg in a spectacular short-track crash that probably cost
him a gold medal.</TE>
<TE>   Ohno was the last American to take the ice for the one-hour,
15-minute workout, clambering over the boards in a red helmet. He
skated slowly at first, staying inside the black lane markers while
his teammates zipped around.</TE>
<TE>   Ohno wore a bandage under his skin suit to cover six stitches in
his thigh.</TE>
<TE>   "He looked great," U.S. Coach Susan Ellis said. "He's in good
spirits."</TE>
<TE>   Ohno was cut by his own skate when four of five skaters collided
and fell on the last lap of the 1,000 meters Saturday night. He
staggered across the line to claim the silver.</TE>
<TE>   During practice at the Salt Lake Ice Sports Complex, Ohno briefly
left the ice to remove the wrap that covered the bandage because it
was irritating him.</TE>
<TE>   Ohno's next race is the 1,500 meters Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Charles Sinek competed in Monday night's Olympic free dance
despite a lung infection.</TE>
<TE>   Sinek and his wife Beata Handra started off the competition and
skated cleanly despite his condition. They finished 23rd out of 24.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier in the day, Sinek had a fever that reached 102 degrees. He
became ill Sunday night, but after taking medication, his temperature
came down.</TE>
<TE>   "The last 30 seconds of our program, I just couldn't breathe and
my legs didn't move very well," he said. "I didn't feel that good
about it."</TE>

<HD>Pelletier, Sale Hit 'Tonight Show'</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CARLA HALL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>If Hollywood is knocking, Canadian pairs skaters David Pelletier and
Jamie Sale are listening.</LD>
<LD>   The pair were adjusting nicely to their first taste of
Hollywood-style celebrity on Monday. They were flown by chartered jet
from Salt Lake City to the Burbank Airport--exhausted, they slept the
hour-and-a-half trip--then whisked by stretch limo to NBC Studios to
tape "The Tonight Show With Jay Leno."</LD>
<LD>   During their eight-minute appearance, they bantered with Leno and
kibitzed, during the commercial break, with fellow guest Charlie
Sheen.</LD>
<TE>   Sale, 24, and Pelletier, 27, had floundered competitively before
they started skating with each other in 1998, and they quickly
realized their potential.</TE>
<TE>   "We were skating for the right reasons. We were skating to be the
top team in the world, not to be fifth or sixth," Pelletier said.</TE>
<TE>   "You kind of get hungry for it," said Sale, who wore black leather
pants on the Leno show.</TE>
<TE>   Dating two years, they live together but work at separating
personal lives from professional lives. "You don't bring on-ice
problems home--and vice versa," Pelletier told Leno during the show.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier in the day in Salt Lake City, skating leaders were
discussing ways to reform the judging process that many critics say
is ripe for abuse. That system has been under heavy scrutiny since a
French judge said she had been pressured to vote a certain way before
casting her vote Monday night to favor Russians Elena Berezhnaya and
Anton Sikharulidze over the Canadians.</TE>
<TE>   The judge has since been suspended and an investigation continues.</TE>
<TE>   One of the reforms proposed Monday would scrap the traditional 6.0
score in place of a scoring system based on points for the difficulty
and execution of jumps and other elements. Changes could also include
expanding judging panels from nine to 14, but only use seven randomly
selected scores.</TE>
<TE>   But Pelletier and Sale said they didn't have enough information on
proposed reforms to comment.</TE>
<TE>   "Our coach ... always told us our job is on the ice. After that,
you have no control," Sale said. Besides, she added "They never asked
skaters in the first place if the system now is OK."</TE>
<TE>   Their business manager, Craig Fenech, estimates he's received
about 1,500 phone calls on his cell phone since last Tuesday, the day
after his clients' silver-then-gold medal performance. Two calls
Monday were about possible made-for-TV movies.</TE>
<TE>   So the pair is reconsidering its options.</TE>
<TE>   "We had a skating plan--to go to Worlds and compete--but sometimes
plans change," said Pelletier, sipping the energy drink Red Bull in
the limo returning him and Sale to the airport so they can fly back
to Salt Lake.</TE>
<TE>   He laughs at the notion that they are going Hollywood.</TE>
<TE>   "We're figure skaters. I don't have the pretension to be a movie
star. I speak French. My English is so-so. But, hey, if the door
opens and I like doing it, I might give it a shot."</TE>

<KH>Mike Penner THE DAY IN SALT LAKE</KH>
<HD>Sounds Like BCS: Bad Call for Skating</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Mike Penner</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>SALT LAKE CITY</DL>
<LD>In a breaking news story that no one can make heads or tails of, the
International Skating Union has proposed radical changes in its
scoring system that could, depending on degree of difficulty,
invalidate the past 94 years of Olympic figure skating results, make
Olympic figure skating judging even more secretive and confusing than
it already is, and turn the sport of Olympic figure skating into
college football.</LD>
<LD>   Let's see if I have this straight:</LD>
<LD>   International figure skating officials have finally admitted that
their sport has too many judges susceptible to collusion and
corruption.</LD>
<TE>   Therefore, international figure skating officials want to increase
the number of figure skating judges at the Olympics from nine to 14.</TE>
<TE>   If the ISU ran boxing, Mike Tyson would have fights booked today
in all 50 states, plus Puerto Rico, Guam and American Samoa.</TE>
<TE>   Then the ISU wants these 14 judges to assign "degree of
difficulty" scores for jumps, spins and footwork--no more 6.0 scoring
system. Instead, ISU President Ottavio Cinquanta suggests that the
judges push buttons to assign grades for "excellent, good, normal and
mediocre."</TE>
<TE>   Of course, Cinquanta stresses that this is a tentative proposal.
Of course. As everyone knows, absolutely nothing in figure skating
can be considered normal.</TE>
<TE>   Then the ISU wants a computer to take these 14 scores and randomly
spit out seven that will count toward a skater's final total. Great.
Isn't this how Nebraska got into the Rose Bowl? Don't these big-sport
bureaucrats ever talk to one another? Mr. Cinquanta, I have a phone
number for you. It belongs to Roy Kramer. I also have three letters
for you: BCS. Ask Mr. Kramer to tell you about them.</TE>
<TE>   Cinquanta believes this new computerized system "will reduce to a
minimum the prospect of bloc voting." Clearly, Cinquanta hasn't
thought this through. What happens, for example, if the person
running the computer is French?</TE>
<TE>   These questions are just a few the ISU membership should ponder
before voting to approve or reject the proposal in June. The vote
will be held in Kyoto, Japan--and isn't that just like figure
skating? We really screwed up the Olympics in Salt Lake City, so
let's all take summer trips to Japan!</TE>
<TE>   While Cinquanta was unveiling his plan to save figure skating
judges from themselves, Canada and the Czech Republic were playing to
a 3-3 tie in men's hockey. NBC should have simulcast them both via
split screen--"What's Right and Wrong With the Salt Lake City
Olympics."</TE>
<TE>   Hockey. Beautiful, uncomplicated hockey. Put the puck in the net
more often than the other guys and you win. That's it. No need for
internal assessments, review boards, commissioned studies and
computer programmers. Put the biscuit in the basket. So easy, so
simple.</TE>
<TE>   Unless you happen to play for the Mighty Ducks.</TE>
<TE>   Which reminds me ...</TE>
<TE>   Here's an Olympic insider's tip to tracking and handicapping the
men's hockey tournament: Whenever in doubt, go with the team with the
ex-Mighty Ducks. Especially when that team is matched against a team
with a current Mighty Duck on its roster.</TE>
<TE>   Consider these results from Monday's last round of group play:</TE>
<TE>   * Teemu Selanne, ex-Mighty Duck, scores Finland's first goal in a
3-1 upset over Russia. Oleg Tverdovsky, current Mighty Duck, plays
for Russia.</TE>
<TE>   * Scott Young, ex-Mighty Duck, scores two goals in the United
States' 8-1 rout of Belarus. Ruslan Salei, current Mighty Duck, plays
for Belarus.</TE>
<TE>   * Team Canada, which previously lost to Sweden and barely got past
Germany, continued its disappointing Olympic run by scrambling to tie
the Czechs and finish group play at 1-1-1. Paul Kariya, current
Mighty Duck, plays for Canada.</TE>
<TE>   Canada has one more game to get its act together. Very quickly
now, the Canadians have to find a way to turn this thing around.
Because they probably won't cut Kariya, their only move left is
obvious: Bring on Patrick Roy.</TE>
<TE>   Yeah, that would be the answer, except for one thing: Roy isn't
here. Why? Roy claims his body needed the rest as the Colorado
Avalanche prepares to defend the Stanley Cup in the approaching NHL
playoffs. Canadian media, however, speculate that Roy decided not to
come to Salt Lake when Team Canada GM Wayne Gretzky wouldn't promise
him the starting goalie assignment.</TE>
<TE>   Either way, that explains why Gretzky looks so pale whenever NBC
aims a camera at him. Or why Gretzky went off during his postgame
meeting with the media, saying that "it sickens my stomach to turn
the TV on. It makes me ill to hear what's being said about Canadian
hockey."</TE>
<TE>   Gretzky accused the Czechs of dirty play and said, somewhat
ominously, "They should remember that there's payback in this game.
And it won't be pretty."</TE>
<TE>   Aside from figure skating protests and Roots apparel sales, it
hasn't been a great Games for Canada. The Canadian men's Alpine ski
team failed to win a medal, so Monday the Canadian Ski Assn. took
what it thought was swift and appropriate action: It announced the
immediate termination of its men's Alpine program for the remainder
of the season and fired of all its men's coaches.</TE>
<TE>   A word of caution, then, to future Canadian Alpine skiers and
coaches. They should remember that there's payback in this game. And
it won't be pretty.</TE>

<HD>The Straight Story Is, They Just Like to Curl</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Bill Plaschke</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>OGDEN, Utah</DL>
<LD>She slides intently toward the target, a blond-haired, blue-eyed ice
sculpture with a chilly stare and a blowtorch voice.</LD>
<LD>   "No! No! No!!"</LD>
<LD>   "Sweep! Sweep! Sweep!"</LD>
<TE>   Each of the 2,000 fans crammed into what feels like a middle
school gymnasium can hear her. Soon, they are shouting as she shouts,
gesturing as she gestures.</TE>
<TE>   Many of them have no idea what's happening.</TE>
<TE>   But they know this is the Olympics, and the Olympics are about
stars, and this is one of them.</TE>
<TE>   "Kari, Kari," shouts a 3-year-old boy, joining the chorus.</TE>
<TE>   "No, no," scolds his father. "You should still call her Mommy."</TE>
<TE>   Meet U.S.-leading, dinner-cooking, toddler-toting,
two-job-working, sweeps-the-ice-and-the-kitchen Kari Erickson.</TE>
<TE>   The Curling Iron?</TE>
<TE>   She is the skip of a four-person U.S. women's team that has
suddenly become one of the cult favorites of these Games.</TE>
<TE>   Part of the reason is they have won six of their nine matches and
advanced to Wednesday's semifinals after an 11-2 victory over Norway
on Monday.</TE>
<TE>   The other reason is their sport is inexplicably on television a
record 50 hours during the Games.</TE>
<TE>   Much of that exposure comes late at night, when bars are closing
and sports fans everywhere are looking up from their beers and
uttering the words that encapsulate this entire endeavor: "What the
...?"</TE>
<TE>   After a few minutes of watching a sport that is essentially a
giant version of tavern sawdust shuffleboard--with ice and 42-pound
stones--they see this screaming woman with the nice smile and ask
another question.</TE>
<TE>   Who the heck is Kari Erickson?</TE>
<TE>   "Yeah, I'm getting some of that e-mail," she said with a laugh.</TE>
<TE>   She's getting more than that.</TE>
<TE>   Autograph seekers hound the team outside the Ogden Ice Sheet.</TE>
<TE>   Lloyd Ward, CEO of the U.S. Olympic Committee, stopped by to shake
hands Monday morning.</TE>
<TE>   The other night, for the first time, Erickson was actually
recognized by someone not carrying a broom.</TE>
<TE>   "A complete stranger walked up to our table, told me good luck and
offered to buy dessert," she said.</TE>
<TE>   So, of course, she coolly embraced her newfound celebrity by
gently blowing him off?</TE>
<TE>   "No way," she said. "I bought two desserts. Cheesecake and carrot
cake."</TE>
<TE>   So goes the appeal of the women curlers, whose charm lies not in
their athletic skills, but in their Midwestern charm.</TE>
<TE>   These could be four women from a bowling league. These could be
the four women directing the carpool lane at your kid's school.</TE>
<TE>   You've seen them all before. You've talked to them all before. At
least one of them has served you potato salad at the firemen's
picnic.</TE>
<TE>   They are a perfect, shirts-untucked fit for a sport whose customs
include the winner buying the loser a drink, and whose participants
sometimes sneak outside for a smoke.</TE>
<TE>   All of the four hold jobs. This includes Erickson, who, when she's
not aiming for the target, is checking prices at Target. She toils
there on weekends, in addition to her job as a middle-school swimming
teacher.</TE>
<TE>   Two of her teammates work at Home Depot. The fourth, Ann
Swisshelm, was laid off from her job at a corrugated box factory
because her bosses wouldn't give her time off for the Olympics.</TE>
<TE>   "I do this because we're like family," Swisshelm said.</TE>
<TE>   Three-fifths of the team are family</TE>
<TE>   Erickson's sister, Stacey Liapis, is one of the four players. Her
father, Mike, is the team's coach.</TE>
<TE>   Many other family members made the trip here from their hometown
of Bemidji, Minn., the curling capital of the country. Of the 15,000
people who curl in this country, about half live in Minnesota or
Wisconsin.</TE>
<TE>   And it seems all of them are here, crammed into three apartments,
many of them sleeping on the floor. The local Elks Club even held a
spaghetti dinner to help the relatives pay their way.</TE>
<TE>   The curling folks are used to tight quarters. When the team trains
in Bemidji, it stays with Erickson and Liapis' grandmother.</TE>
<TE>   Not that training involves anything more complicated than curling.
Erickson said she spends maybe two months lifting weights in the
local recreation center.</TE>
<TE>   At least those weights include curls.</TE>
<TE>   "We're regular people who like to curl, nothing more," Erickson
said.</TE>
<TE>   They liked it so much while growing up, Erickson and Liapis had
the keys to the local curling club. The sport not only brought them
to the Olympics, it may have saved their relationship.</TE>
<TE>   Erickson, 30, used to fight continually with Liapis, 27, over
clothes.</TE>
<TE>   "I wanted to use her clothes, and she didn't want to let me, so we
tangled all the time," Liapis said. "Used to even bite each other."</TE>
<TE>   The curling sheet was the one place they didn't fight, so they
kept doing it.</TE>
<TE>   Today, they know each other so well, Liapis can tell how much she
needs to sweep--clearing the ice of its tiny pebbles and increasing
the distance of the throw--simply by hearing the tone in her sister's
voice.</TE>
<TE>   "They've come a long way from fighting in the closet," said their
mother, Sue.</TE>
<TE>   They've come a long way, period.</TE>
<TE>   Last week, on the opening day of curling here, only a handful of
people in the crowd even had a clue about the sport. What was
supposed to be an intimate, loud arena sounded more like a quiet,
confused bus station.</TE>
<TE>   The fans?</TE>
<TE>   "I'm watching everybody else to see when to cheer," said
14-year-old Greg Schlesinger. "But it's obvious, nobody else knows
either."</TE>
<TE>   The rented bagpipe band that, in keeping with tradition, marches
on to the ice before each match?</TE>
<TE>   "No idea what's going on," drummer Aegina Spencer said. "I just
know somebody goes, 'Shh, shh, shh' and then somebody else goes,
'Hip, hip, hip.'"</TE>
<TE>   The guy selling programs that should have explained the sport?</TE>
<TE>   "The only thing I know is, get it close to the circle, right?"
Bryan Child said.</TE>
<TE>   The target is not called a circle, it's called a "house."</TE>
<TE>   And a week later, amid a standing, flag-waving, hollering crowd
that has come to understand victory if nothing else, it has become
Kari Erickson's house.</TE>
<TE>   "Just a working mom," said the Olympics hippest new star. "Just
trying to fit curling in somewhere."</TE>

<HD>Tribute to 9/11 Victims Disallowed</HD>
<DH>A New York paramedic who aided in the rescue says the IOC
won't let him use a skeleton sled honoring the lives lost.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRIS DUFRESNE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>PARK CITY, Utah</DL>
<LD>The taping over of uniform logos has long been a painful ritual for
Olympic athletes, individual expression and sponsorship having to
give way to a mass umbrella of corporate commercialism.</LD>
<LD>   New York City paramedic Michael Voudouris thought the
International Olympic Committee might make an exception in his case.</LD>
<LD>   He was wrong and doesn't have nearly enough tape to cover his
tracks.</LD>
<TE>   Voudouris, 41, learned through back channels he will not be able
to race in Wednesday's men's skeleton event at Utah Olympic Park with
a sled he dedicated to lives lost in the terrorist attacks of Sept.
11.</TE>
<TE>   Voudouris, who lives in New York but races for Greece under dual
citizenship, is an emergency medical technician who raced to ground
zero on Sept. 11 to help with the rescue effort. The soot and ash
from the scene scratched his cornea and fouled his bronchial
passages.</TE>
<TE>   He ground his teeth so much in his sleep, a result of recurring
nightmares, he said he fractured his molars and had to have a double
root canal.</TE>
<TE>   When Voudouris miraculously made the Greek Olympic team in
skeleton by nabbing the final qualifying spot by one-hundredth of a
second, he decided he was going to find a way to pay his respects.</TE>
<TE>   So, on the bottom of his sled, he painted an abstract of the World
Trade Center's twin towers and etched other reminders.</TE>
<TE>   "Greece lost 30 people," Voudouris said, "I have the No. 30, and
that's not allowed on it. That's a political statement. And I have my
high school that lost 32 people. Firemen and parents of students."</TE>
<TE>   Voudouris used his sled in World Cup competition but cannot in
Olympic competition under IOC Rule 61, which prevents the display of
commercial logos or statements that can be seen as political.</TE>
<TE>   Voudouris has almost no chance of winning a medal. This isn't
short-track speedskating, where a crash on the final turn can bump
last place to gold.</TE>
<TE>   Voudouris was ranked 41st on the World Cup circuit and finished
24th of 26 racers in Monday's training run.</TE>
<TE>   Yet he was hoping to bring something to these Games--his heartfelt
feelings.</TE>
<TE>   He said it was unlikely anyone would even see his artwork.</TE>
<TE>   "It's on the underside," he said. "No one's going to see it unless
it flips over."</TE>
<TE>   Voudouris had guessed his sled would not be approved, so he
quietly put out an inquiry and got the answer he expected.</TE>
<TE>   "They're doing the courtesy of telling me now so I have three days
to decide what to do," Voudouris said. "To either get disqualified,
to remove the thing off my sled, which I don't want to do. Or to find
a new sled."</TE>
<TE>   He may end up with option No. 3. Voudouris has been offered a
backup sled from American Trevor Christie, who did not qualify for
the Olympics.</TE>
<TE>   An international bobsled spokesman told Associated Press on Monday
that the federation did not want to become any part of a controversy.</TE>
<TE>   "The [International Bobsled Federation] says it is a problem,
remove it," Voudouris said of his sled. "They said the IOC came back
to them and said it's not allowed to have anything like that that
might be considered remotely as a political statement."</TE>
<TE>   Voudouris still hasn't decided what he's going to do. Since home
country flags are allowed to be displayed, he may stick 30 tiny Greek
flags on the bottom to honor those who died on Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm allowed the Greek flag," he said. "They didn't say how many."</TE>
<TE>   Voudouris is also torn.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't want to hurt the sport, because they've worked very hard
to get here," he said.</TE>
<TE>   So what's he going to do?'</TE>
<TE>   "We'll have to wait until Wednesday," he said. "They might catch
it and I might get disqualified, or they might say I have to remove
that and I might have time to remove that. But I've got to do
something."</TE>
<TE>   Voudouris began skeleton, a luge-like event in which racers go
face-first down an ice track, only in 1996. This is the first time
skeleton has been an Olympic event since the 1948 St. Moritz Games.</TE>
<TE>   Voudouris, a former sports photographer, was introduced to the
sport while on a photo shoot of former racer Julie Walker. She
wouldn't allow him to take pictures until he tried a run first.</TE>
<TE>   One run was all it took for Voudouris to become hooked.</TE>
<TE>   In the wake of Sept. 11, Voudouris says racing skeleton has been a
welcome release. Many see the sport as dangerous and those who race
as crazed adrenaline freaks. Voudouris says his mind starts to unwind
on the six-hour drive from his home in New York to the training track
in Lake Placid.</TE>
<TE>   "I find it very relaxing, soothing," he said of the sport. "This
thing, you get up on top and the whole world shuts off, but then it
opens up and you say, 'Oh my God, I'm going to throw myself on this
thing real fast and I'm going 75 mph.'</TE>
<TE>   "There are times when it's almost like you've stopped moving and
everything else moves around you.</TE>
<TE>   "It's almost like virtual reality, until you get hit. And then
it's back to reality."</TE>

<KH>SKI JUMPING</KH>
<HD>Edged at the Finnish</HD>
<DH>Schmitt's jump near end of event gives Germany the gold
over Finland by a tenth of a point.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE KUPPER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>PARK CITY, Utah</DL>
<LD>Slovenia's Robert Kranjec had the longest leap Monday in Olympic team
ski jumping at Utah Olympic Park.</LD>
<LD>   But Germany's Martin Schmitt had the biggest one.</LD>
<LD>   Schmitt, on the second-last jump of the day, soared 123.5 meters
off the 120-meter slide--the skiers call it the big hill--earning
121.3 points and giving Germany the gold medal--by a tenth of a
point, the closest margin in Olympic history.</LD>
<TE>   Finland finished second, by that tenth of a point, even though the
final Finnish jumper, Janne Ahonen, had sprung 125.5 meters just
before Schmitt jumped.</TE>
<TE>   "We barely made it," Schmitt said. "I heard the distance of Ahonen
and I knew I had to do my best .... It was so close. I was too late
on my takeoff, but I made it. Tonight will be the biggest party Salt
Lake has ever seen."</TE>
<TE>   In team jumping, each country has four jumpers, and each jumper
gets two jumps. Points are awarded for distance--or subtracted, if
the jumper lands short of the target distance--and style, which
involves both flight and landing. Each jumper's points are added
together, then combined with his teammates'.</TE>
<TE>   Germany, thanks to Schmitt's clutch jump, finished with 974.1
points, Finland with 974.</TE>
<TE>   Slovenia, surprisingly, beat out traditional jumping power Austria
and defending Olympic champion Japan for the bronze, the first
Olympic ski jumping medal in the country's history. With Kranjec
soaring 133 meters in the first round--longest jump of the day--the
Slovenians totaled 946.3 points, to 926.8 for Austria and 926 for
Japan.</TE>
<TE>   "My first jump was very good," Kranjec said. "We had [winning a
medal] a little bit in mind."</TE>
<TE>   So did Germany, but even after Schmitt had jumped, no one was sure
for half a minute what color it would be. Hunched over his skis in
the outrun, Schmitt covered his eyes, then sneaked a peek at the
scoreboard. He leaped into the air when he saw his numbers, then was
engulfed by teammates Sven Hannawald, Stephan Hocke and Michaeal
Uhrmann, and the foursome rolled around in the snow.</TE>
<TE>   Schmitt's first jump, 131.5 meters, had put Germany ahead in the
first round, but Finland's first three jumpers out-jumped Germany's
first three in the second round and it all came down to Ahonen and
Schmitt.</TE>
<TE>   Ahonen did all that he could; Schmitt all that he needed.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm very happy about the medal but the way it happened was not so
nice," Ahonen said. "I did my best. Germany was exactly .10 points
better."</TE>
<TE>   In the previous closest finish, Finland beat Austria by 1.5 points
for the gold medal in the Albertville Games in 1992.</TE>
<TE>   Simon Ammann of Switzerland started the day with an opportunity to
win his third gold medal of the Games, having won the 90- and
120-meter individual events. He jumped well enough, sailing 128.5
meters on his first jump, 130 on his second, but got little support
from his teammates and the Swiss finished seventh.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. was 11th in the 13-team competition, with only anchor
Alan Alborn matching the target distance. He had jumps of 120.5 and
120 meters.</TE>
<TE>   "They were better than in the past, so that's good," he said.
"Finishing 11th is better than I expected."</TE>
<TE>   Alborn, who had announced after the individual jumping that he'd
had enough and would quit jumping after this season, apparently is
having second thoughts.</TE>
<TE>   "There's a lot of determining factors but nothing's for sure," he
said when asked again about his proposed retirement.</TE>

<HD>Ugly Event Turns Into a Free Fall</HD>

<LD>Every skier knows that klutzy feeling--and the oafish-looking
fall--that results from "catching an edge."</LD>
<LD>   Big-time skiers are no exception.</LD>
<LD>   At Monday's team ski jumping, Finland's Matti Hautamaki landed a
nice 125-meter jump, then cast a glance over his shoulder at the
scoreboard as he skied through the outrun. At which point, he caught
an edge, fell, then rolled over, skis in the air, trying to regain
his balance.</LD>
<TE>   Part of ski jumping involves style points for landing. Was
Hautamaki in trouble that way?</TE>
<TE>   "I just hoped it would not be judged as a fall," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Had it happened on his landing, it doubtless would have been.
Because Hautamaki was beyond the landing area, however, no style
points were subtracted and he and his teammates went on to earn the
silver medal.</TE>
<TE>   It's OK to Cry</TE>
<TE>   Speedskater Chris Witty, who came back from mononucleosis to win
the gold medal in the women's 1,500 meters Sunday, has a reputation
for toughness. At 26, she is, after all, an Olympic veteran.</TE>
<TE>   She made her Games debut at Lillehammer in 1994, then skated at
Nagano in 1998, winning a silver medal in the 1,000 and a bronze in
the 1,500.</TE>
<TE>   She swapped her skates for a bike at Sydney in 2000 and finished
fifth in the women's 500-meter time trials.</TE>
<TE>   So when she learned of her illness in mid-January she tried to
approach the setback with professional detachment.</TE>
<TE>   "I was relieved," she said. "I knew something was wrong, and now,
at least, I knew what it was and could try to work through it."</TE>
<TE>   Feeling sorry for herself was not in the equation, she added.</TE>
<TE>   "I never let myself cry. 'Don't do that,' I told myself. 'That's
stupid.'"</TE>
<TE>   But even tough athletes have emotions, and when Witty surprised
herself by winning the 1,000, she was seen choking back tears.</TE>
<TE>   "I cried a little bit on the ice," she said. "Tears of joy."</TE>
<TE>   Shut Your Strap</TE>
<TE>   The NHL players are generally in favor of the international rules
used for Olympic hockey play.</TE>
<TE>   They particularly like the absence of the red line that allows for
longer passes, and the quicker faceoffs that speed up the pace of the
game.</TE>
<TE>   But members of Team USA were mocking the rule that players must
keep their helmets on while on the ice after Brett Hull received an
"illegal equipment" penalty in the first period Monday against
Belarus. His helmet was knocked off, and he quickly picked it up and
popped it on his head without fastening the chin strap. Hull was
still sent to the penalty box for two minutes.</TE>
<TE>   "I read the rule on the board before the game started," said Hull,
who plays for the Detroit Red Wings. "[It] said if your helmet goes
off, either go straight to the bench or immediately try to put it
back on. I put it back on. They didn't say it had to look good."</TE>
<TE>   Added Philadelphia Flyer forward Jeremy Roenick: "I think that
equipment rule is no good. Hully went out of his way to get the
helmet and put it back on, but the chin strap was over his nose and
it's a penalty. I don't see how that dictates the game whatsoever. I
think that's an idiotic rule. Whoever made up that rule is
brain-dead."</TE>
<TE>   Roenick has another rule change he wants implemented.</TE>
<TE>   "I think they should make the nets bigger," he said. "Maybe soccer
goal-sized would be great."</TE>
<TE>   'What Are You, Blind?'</TE>
<TE>   The pairs ice skating scandal has led the International Skating
Union to propose a reform of figure skating judging. Steve Cohen,
director of national teams for USA Baseball, the governing body of
amateur baseball in the U.S., offered this suggestion: "You could
easily correct the problem in figure skating if you allowed skating
managers to approach judges like we allow baseball managers to do.
Imagine Tom Lasorda scooting across the ice and getting in their
face."</TE>
<TE>   Still Scrambling</TE>
<TE>   Steve Young is even a triple threat at the Olympics.</TE>
<TE>   Young, the former San Francisco 49er quarterback and a descendant
of Mormon pioneer Brigham Young, was the first volunteer signed up to
help with tasks big and small at the Winter Games.</TE>
<TE>   So far, he has carried Britain's team banner in the parade of
athletes at the opening ceremony and helped warm up the crowd for pop
group Train at the Olympic Medals Plaza.</TE>
<TE>   Monday morning, the work was more mundane. Young was playing
paperboy, toting a stack of newspapers through the lobby of the
International Olympic Committee's hotel.</TE>
<TE>   Making the Cut</TE>
<TE>   Mary Goodro worries that an Olympic athlete will raise a gold
medal high overhead and come down with a bloody finger.</TE>
<TE>   Goodro is one of 16 flower arrangers who de-thorn hundreds of
yellow roses a day for the bouquets presented to Olympic medalists.</TE>
<TE>   Despite wearing thick gloves, she gets her share of nicks, but she
doesn't mind.</TE>
<TE>   "We're sacrificing ourselves for the Olympians," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Nightly at the Olympic medals plaza, 25 yellow rosebuds,
appropriately named "Golden Gate" roses, are presented to each
medal-winning athlete.</TE>
<TE>   The Paper Trail</TE>
<TE>   Medalists from around the world were being heralded back home in
different ways.</TE>
<TE>   Newspapers in China saluted the country's first Winter Olympics
gold ever without saying much about the woman who won it, speedskater
Yang Yang (A).</TE>
<TE>   Italian Daniela Ceccarelli's super-G victory was joyously
celebrated around her country, where she was being compared to the
great Alberto Tomba.</TE>
<TE>   In Norway, a newspaper advertisement congratulating Alpine skier
Kjetil Andre Aamodt for his second gold of the Games appeared to
violate Olympic rules.</TE>
<TE>   Aamodt's ski and boot supplier paid for the ad, which had a
picture of the skier kissing his skis, with the company's logo and a
note of thanks. Olympic rules generally prohibit sponsors printing
photographs of athletes and citing their results during the Games.</TE>
<TE>   "I reacted strongly when I heard about the ad," Aamodt said. "I
have had no contact with my equipment maker about such marketing, and
it was completely unknown to me that the advertisement was going to
be printed."</TE>
<TE>   No disciplinary action is likely.</TE>
<TE>   In China, papers ran front-page photos of Yang holding a Chinese
flag, but that was about all the notice she received.</TE>
<TE>   Italy's reaction to the triumph by Ceccarelli was considerably
more personal. Premier Silvio Berlusconi phoned her and newspapers
hailed the "city skier" from the Rome suburb of Rocca Priora.</TE>
<TE>   He's Not Sold</TE>
<TE>   Jim Litke of the Associated Press doesn't think much of the
investigation into the figure skating scandal. He believes the truth
will come out "just about the time pigs are doing triple axels."</TE>
<TE>   Also, Litke adds:</TE>
<TE>   "Decisions have been made by the ISU and the International Olympic
Committee on nothing more definitive than NBC's incessant howling,
hastily conducted public-opinion polls and a few fingers held up to
the wind. If they thought throwing a medal behind them while running
away from an angry mob would be enough, they know now it wasn't."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>

the Associated Press contributed to this report.</TE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WEST VALLEY CITY, Utah</DL>
<LD>The same refrain comes out every day in the interview area at the E
Center. In such an evenly matched hockey tournament, the difference
will be the best goaltender.</LD>
<LD>   That wasn't the case in the first game Monday. Belarussian goalie
Andrei Mezin was outstanding against the United States, but all it
gave his team was a one-period edge before Belarus caved in to an
onslaught by Team USA.</LD>
<LD>   The United States (2-0-1) wrapped up its final-round play with an
8-1 victory, thanks to a 48-13 advantage in shots on goal.</LD>
<TE>   Russia's loss to Finland later in the day assured the United
States the No. 1 seeding from Group D. The U.S. will play Germany in
the quarterfinals Wednesday night.</TE>
<TE>   Belarus, which won its pool in the qualifying round, finished 0-3
in the final round.</TE>
<TE>   John LeClair (of the NHL's Philadelphia Flyers), Scott Young (St.
Louis Blues) and Bill Guerin (Boston Bruins) each scored two goals
for the United States. The Kings' Adam Deadmarsh scored his first
goal of the tournament and added an assist as well.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. Coach Herb Brooks stayed with the line of LeClair, Mike
Modano and Brett Hull that he formed in the third period of Team
USA's 2-2 tie against Russia on Saturday and it continued to lead the
way. With Modano moving the puck around like Jason Kidd on the
fastbreak, Hull firing away and LeClair digging in by the crease, the
threesome generated 16 shots, all but one by Hull and LeClair.</TE>
<TE>   Modano and Hull played three years together in Dallas before Hull
joined the Detroit Red Wings this season.</TE>
<TE>   "There's a little bit of history there, so we kind of have a good
feel for each other," Modano said. "I know what Brett's doing, where
he's going. And Johnny, he knows where to go to score his goals. It's
real simple."</TE>
<TE>   Brooks, as if trying to prove his statement that he had confidence
in all three of his goaltenders, started Tom Barrasso after solid
outings by Mike Dunham and Mike Richter in the first two games.</TE>
<TE>   Barrasso gave up a goal to Dmitry Pankov 20 seconds into the game.</TE>
<TE>   And with Mezin shutting down the Americans, Hull started thinking
the United States could end up on the wrong side of this Olympic
hockey moment.</TE>
<TE>   "You go back through the history of hockey, all the great times
that an underestimated team with a great goalie has come up with a
big win," Hull said. "We had great chances. He just kept making save
after save."</TE>
<TE>   Mezin came through in situations that were straight from the
"Worst-Case Scenarios" section of the goalie manual. How would you
like to see Chris Drury bearing down on you after juking a defenseman
out of his skates? Or Hull alone with the puck in front of the net
with time to make two fakes? What about Doug Weight perched on the
doorstep? Mezin stopped them all.</TE>
<TE>   And when Mezin wasn't good, he was lucky. He chased one puck all
the way out to the corner. Brian Rolston beat him to it, but his shot
sailed through the crease and off to the other side of the rink.</TE>
<TE>   Hull broke through with a slap shot 46 seconds into the second
period.</TE>
<TE>   Hull didn't even raise his arms to celebrate. He stood with his
stick by his waist, with a look on his face that clearly expressed
the translation he gave later: "It's about time."</TE>
<TE>   Exactly two minutes later, LeClair scored a power-play goal when
he knocked a rebound off Mezin and into the net. LeClair scored again
71/2 minutes into the second.</TE>
<TE>   The other lines joined in during the third period.</TE>
<TE>   "They pulled their weight again tonight," Deadmarsh said of the
first line. "A few other guys were able to chip in. We're going to
need that throughout the rest of the tournament."</TE>
<TE>   Teamwork continued to be the theme for a group that has been
together only five days.</TE>
<TE>   "I think everybody's really sacrificing things for the better of
the team," Modano said. "Everybody's got great skill and a great feel
for the game. It's the little things that we have to sacrifice just
to make us a better team overall defensively. The lines seem to jell
a little quicker.</TE>
<TE>   "Every game, we seem to have gotten better and better."</TE>
<TE>   And, just to prove that you can't go too long without talking
about the goaltenders, forward Jeremy Roenick said: "To give up three
goals in three games at this level of competition is pretty
spectacular. We're just getting going."</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The United States and Canada start their playoff rounds today as they
move closer to their anticipated showdown for the gold medal.</LD>
<LD>   The United States plays Sweden. Canada, which beat Sweden, 11-0,
Saturday, plays Finland.</LD>
<LD>   Finland is considered the best of the rest of the field. Team
Finland gave the Americans their closest game before falling, 5-0, on
Saturday.</LD>
<TE>   The United States has outscored its opponents, 27-1, the lone goal
coming on a fluky shot from center ice by China. Canada has not given
up a goal yet, while scoring 25.</TE>
<TE>   United States forward Natalie Darwitz, an 18-year-old from Eagan,
Minn., leads all scorers in the Olympics with six goals and an
assist.</TE>
<TE>   The United States has never lost in international competition,
except to Canada.</TE>
<TE>   The Americans have defeated Canada in eight consecutive games,
dating to Canada's victory in the 2001 world championships.</TE>
<TE>   So far, the Americans have been able to keep it light in between
games, having fun with their coach, Ben Smith, and his amusing and
puzzling sayings.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. forward Karyn Bye is keeper of a book of "Smithisms."</TE>
<TE>   The collection that Smith uses to motivate the players is growing
daily. "You always say, 'Where's this going?'" captain Cammi Granato
said. "You ponder it for a while, and then you figure it out."</TE>
<TE>   Yet the players aren't fooled by Smith's self-deprecating style or
the folksy aphorisms like, "The hay is in the barn, ladies."</TE>
<TE>   Said Bye: "He comes up with things like that all the time. But
Coach is one of the smartest people I've ever met."</TE>

<KH>WHERE ARE THEY NOW?</KH>
<HD>Long Path Has Rewards for Babilonia, Gardner</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In 1980 two Southern California kids were supposed to end the Russian
domination of pairs figure skating at the Olympics.</LD>
<LD>   Tai Babilonia and Randy Gardner were the defending world
champions. The Winter Olympics were in the United States, at Lake
Placid, N.Y. Tai and Randy were already on a first-name basis with
the American public. They were set to be the stars of Lake Placid.
And they never got to skate.</LD>
<LD>   Gardner had injured his groin muscle before arriving in Lake
Placid. Even though he took a pain-killing shot before going out for
short program warmups, Gardner fell four times on simple jumps. Coach
John Nicks realized it would be impossible for Babilonia and Gardner
to skate. He signaled the judges and pulled the pair off the ice.
Babilonia was in tears and Gardner in shock.</LD>
<TE>   Irina Rodnina and Aleksandr Zaitsev of the Soviet Union skated
flawlessly and won the gold unanimously. Babilonia and Gardner went
home to try to train for the world championships, but Gardner's
injury was still too painful and the two never skated in amateur
competition again.</TE>
<TE>   Babilonia, 42, made a well-publicized suicide attempt and
struggled with an eating disorder and drug and alcohol addictions. It
was Gardner, 44, who held Babilonia's head while her stomach was
pumped after she overdosed on prescription drugs.</TE>
<TE>   And 22 years after Lake Placid, Tai and Randy are still skating
partners. "I'm real proud of our career," Gardner said. "Our
relationship has lasted longer than most marriages. Sometimes people
will ask if we're bitter about what happened in Lake Placid. But I
say no, we're both better people because of what happened."</TE>
<TE>   After Lake Placid, Babilonia and Gardner went on to the
skating-show life. Babilonia battled weight gain, and drug and
alcohol addictions, byproducts of her lack of self-esteem, she said.
That led her to attempt suicide in 1988.</TE>
<TE>   She is now the mother of a 7-year-old son, Scout. Babilonia was
married to rock musician Cary Butler. They divorced but still live on
the same block in Sherman Oaks, and Scout's dad takes care of him
when Babilonia travels.</TE>
<TE>   Gardner, who lives in Marina del Rey, has carved a career in
skating choreography and production of skating shows. He recently
directed and staged a production of "Footloose on Ice" with Nancy
Kerrigan. He and Babilonia also do motivational speaking. The week
before the Olympics found them in Atlanta speaking to a group of home
builders about skating and the Olympics.</TE>
<TE>   Babilonia also designs clothing and a line of butterfly jewelry.
Scout is a surfer and a guitar player. "He is the coolest," Babilonia
says.</TE>
<TE>   Her memories of 1980 still are conflicted</TE>
<TE>   "When Randy collapsed, it seemed like it took hours," Babilonia
said. "I know I was crying. In a matter of minutes, our lives had
changed even before we walked off the ice.</TE>
<TE>   "We stayed for the rest of the Olympics while Randy was getting
treatment. I got to watch Eric Heiden skate, and it was so beautiful.
I got to meet Beth Heiden, I got to see the U.S. hockey team, so
there were some great moments. It wasn't all a complete downer.</TE>
<TE>   "I know a lot of people think my problems stemmed from what
happened in 1980, but that wasn't true. They stemmed from my not
dealing with things from the time I was a teenager. Year after year I
never showed pain or sadness. I didn't know how to express what I was
feeling. I could skate how I was feeling, but I couldn't verbalize
it."</TE>
<TE>   Both Babilonia and Gardner said they are happy to still be
involved in skating and with each other. "I think the whole life
picture for both of us is very good now," Gardner said. "We are
pretty satisfied with where life has taken us."</TE>

<LD>A triumvirate has seized control of boys' golf in Southern
California, rising to power in the mid-1990's and showing no signs of
relinquishing its power.</LD>
<LD>   Santa Barbara San Marcos, Santa Margarita and Palm Desert have
combined to win every Southern Section team title since 1996 and have
won the last five CIF-Southern California Golf Assn. team titles.</LD>
<LD>   They have combined for eight of the last 10 section titles and
seven of the last nine CIF-SCGA titles.</LD>
<TE>   And this year, expect more of the same.</TE>
<TE>   San Marcos, which won the Southern Section and CIF-SCGA titles
last year, has four returning starters. Palm Desert, runner-up to San
Marcos in the section final, has three returning starters. Santa
Margarita, which finished third in the section and CIF, has five
players returning with significant varsity experience.</TE>
<TE>   It's the kind of run that wears on opposing teams, but never gets
old for those in power.</TE>
<TE>   "Not as long as we're one of them, anyway," Palm Desert Coach Tim
Kabeary said.</TE>
<TE>   Selecting a clear favorite among the three is difficult, though
San Marcos is the top pick based on its tournament-record,
five-player score of 359 in the section finals last year.</TE>
<TE>   USC-bound senior Tyler Ley, medalist in that tournament with a 67,
and junior Kevin Larsen, who shot 70 to lead the Lions in the
CIF-SCGA finals last year, are the top two returners for San Marcos.</TE>
<TE>   Derek Uyesaka, a junior, and senior David Siordia, both of whom
had solid postseasons last year, also return.</TE>
<TE>   Santa Margarita has USC-bound senior Taylor Wood, a four-year
varsity starter, and senior twins Steve and Jeff Bullock back from
last year's team.</TE>
<TE>   Sean Heath, Steve Harward and Mike Tran also had significant
varsity experience last year and give the Eagles a deep lineup.</TE>
<TE>   Palm Desert is counting on senior Sean Meier, the leading scorer
for the Aztecs in the section and CIF-SCGA finals last year, and
Aaron Davis, a sophomore who was second on the team in both events.</TE>
<TE>   Kyle Forbes, a sophomore, is also back, though he broke his pelvis
in a car accident and will miss at least half of the season.</TE>
<TE>   "There are just certain areas that have schools that are good in
certain sports," San Marcos Coach Aaron Solis said.</TE>
<TE>   "Some schools are volleyball schools, some are football schools,
we just happen to be golf schools.</TE>
<TE>   "And once your program is successful, good players see that and
want to be a part of it."</TE>
<TE>   The odds are against a team outside of the big three winning a
major title this year, but Kabeary sees other teams closing the gap
every year.</TE>
<TE>   "Everyone is getting so much better," he said. "It's getting so
hard to tell the difference between the good teams anymore."</TE>
<TE>   Riverside Poly and Long Beach Wilson appear to have the firepower
to contend, for a title this year, but any edge in talent can be
erased immediately when an opposing player arrives on the tee
carrying a San Marcos, Santa Margarita or Palm Desert golf bag.</TE>
<TE>   "It can be intimidating," Kabeary said. "You hear about how good a
player is or a team is and it throws you off.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not until you play a round with them that you realize you
have the talent to play with them."</TE>
<TE>   And in high school, where trophies are handed out at the end of
one-round events, by then it's too late.</TE>

<LD>Those pesky losses to inferior teams like the Atlanta Hawks and the
Chicago Bulls and the Portland Trailblazers, they get so easily
forgotten. Shaquille O'Neal comes back, the Lakers win a dozen in a
row, the playoffs arrive and no Laker fan is going to remember how
upsetting it was to see the Hawks beat the world champions.</LD>
<LD>   But then you catch a snippet of a radio news update, just the very
end, and hear the words "Lakers" and "may be out for the season."</LD>
<LD>   O'Neal's toe is worse, that must be it. Not good news and maybe
that three-peat won't be happening, maybe another world championship
will have to wait until next year. But maybe there's an upside, too,
and his arthritic toe will heal and O'Neal will come back without
pain and with fresh enthusiasm for basketball.</LD>
<TE>   But it's not O'Neal who's done for the year. It's much worse.</TE>
<TE>   It's Chick Hearn.</TE>
<TE>   Only two weeks from returning to his job as Laker broadcaster
after almost a two-month layoff following heart surgery, Hearn fell
and broke his hip. And today he will have hip surgery. He won't be
back on the air March 1, as he said he would. The Lakers are going to
have to move through the playoffs without Hearn. They'll probably
have O'Neal but, really, who would you miss more, Hearn or O'Neal?</TE>
<TE>   Nobody wants to cast that vote.</TE>
<TE>   Sunday night, Hearn and his wife, Marge, were out for dinner when
they stopped to get gas. When Hearn got out of the car at the pump,
he slipped and fell. That's so Hearn, 85 years old, still pumping his
own gas.</TE>
<TE>   A week ago, Hearn was talking on the radio, speaking in his
strong, Chick voice, sounding like a 5-year-old waiting for Santa
Claus. Hearn's Christmas was to be March 1. Our present was going to
be Hearn back on the air, explaining to all the Southland what each
Laker was doing, where each Laker was standing.</TE>
<TE>   His heart was strong too, it was so obvious from listening to
Hearn. He was embracing his life, his fans, his Lakers. He was
excited and thankful to be coming back to work.</TE>
<TE>   What a wonderful thing that is, to love one's work.</TE>
<TE>   There will be many now who will wish Hearn well and beg him to
take as much time off as he needs, to not rush his recovery. There
will be well-meaning people who will wonder if it isn't time for
Hearn to think of himself, to take care of himself, to explore other
parts of his life. Hearn deserves it, they will say. Hearn deserves
the rest, he deserves the chance to vacation in Hawaii or to read a
good book, to sleep late every day and never have to catch a 5 a.m.
limo to the airport for a 7 a.m. flight to Cleveland.</TE>
<TE>   But that would be missing the point of a man who loves his job.</TE>
<TE>   Every game, every half, every quarter that the Lakers play makes
Hearn smile and he makes us smile when he tells us about it all.</TE>
<TE>   Nit-pickers will whine that Hearn pronounced somebody's name wrong
or used only a number and not a name to identify an opposing player.
"That No. 20 is killing the Lakers," Hearn will say, and if you're at
home or in the car and don't know who No. 20 is, it can drive you a
little nuts.</TE>
<TE>   The thing is, though, you can always find out who No. 20 is. You
can look it up. But only Hearn can make you see exactly what No. 20
is doing and why he is able to do it and why the Lakers aren't
stopping No. 20 from killing them.</TE>
<TE>   So don't wish Hearn well by telling him to take his time. Don't
tell Hearn not to rush back.</TE>
<TE>   Hearn wants to rush back. The man broadcast 3,338 consecutive
games until his Dec. 19 heart surgery. Even people who love their
jobs will get flu and take a day off, have a fever and not be able to
drag themselves out of the house. But Hearn never had to drag
himself, and he was marking off the days on the calendar until March
1.</TE>
<TE>   And he'll keep marking off the days now.</TE>
<TE>   As the Lakers continue their season, as we receive daily updates
on the state of O'Neal's big toe, now we'll also need daily updates
on the state of Hearn's hip. The Lakers should put Hearn on their
daily injury report because, in his way, Hearn is as important as any
Laker player.</TE>
<TE>   Ever.</TE>
<TE>   Hearn's voice can make us feel confident about the Lakers. If
O'Neal needs more rest, Hearn's voice can make us believe Kobe Bryant
can go it alone and the Lakers would still be OK. Hearn's voice tells
us when to be really mad at the Lakers, or worried about the Lakers,
and it can also tell us what an important loss is and what a
meaningless loss is.</TE>
<TE>   A loss to Atlanta in February is meaningless. That's what Hearn
would say.</TE>
<TE>   We know Hearn will listen to every Laker game. A week from now,
Hearn will probably have the sound down on the television and he'll
be calling games and Marge will be so lucky. She'll get to hear the
call.</TE>
<TE>   If only the rest of us could come over and listen.</TE>

<HD>Raider Moves Enough to Make Your Toes Curl</HD>

<LD>Consider how much follow-up fanfare there would have been in the
newspaper today had it been team owner Michael Ovitz at the podium
Monday afternoon to make the ESPN-televised announcement that the Los
Angeles Stars' first selection in the NFL expansion draft was former
USC tackle Tony Boselli.</LD>
<LD>   Or imagine the buzz at work today had Al Davis won his lawsuit
last summer freeing his team to return, everyone waking up Monday to
learn Los Angeles Raider Coach Jon Gruden had left to take a job in
Tampa.</LD>
<LD>   Instead we got eight pages of Olympic coverage today and Plaschke
doing a column on curling.</LD>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   THE NFL might not be in Los Angeles, but Sunday San Francisco
Coach Steve Mariucci was in Beverly Hills, where Edward Glazer--son
of Buccaneer owner Malcolm Glazer--maintains a home and office, to
discuss becoming Tampa Bay's new coach and general manager.</TE>
<TE>   When I called Tampa to inquire why the team's executive VP makes
his home and works here, the Bucs' publicity director became
extremely agitated and wanted to know if I was suggesting the Bucs
were thinking about moving to L.A.</TE>
<TE>   I hadn't given that any thought, although I've heard the Glazers
are trying to sell their team. But now that I am thinking about it,
wouldn't you like to see the look on Davis' face if Gruden returned
to L.A. walking the sidelines in a new Hollywood Park Stadium that
was originally planned for the Raiders?</TE>
<TE>   By the way, the same 99 acres adjacent to the race track that had
been set aside for a new stadium for the Raiders eight years ago
remain unsold. There have been inquiries--as recently as last
week--from investors interested in buying the land to build a
football stadium here. But R.D. Hubbard, who is overseeing the sale,
said he expects the land to be sold in the next two weeks for a
retail complex.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   OVITZ HAD said he would deliver a football team to L.A., and today
would have been a big day. Of course, he had also promised to
introduce me to Lara Flynn Boyle and Salma Hayek, and I had to do
that myself. I called him Monday to find out what he was doing while
Texan owner Robert McNair announced the selection of Boselli and to
remind him he had failed to deliver Boyle and Hayek.</TE>
<TE>   "I think about it a lot, and it's painful," he said, and I told
him to get over it; Boyle, Hayek and I are now old chums.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm talking about the football team," he said. "I still have
interest in getting a football team for L.A., but I'm not sure that
feeling is shared by a lot of other people."</TE>
<TE>   Ovitz was a guest of NFL Commissioner Paul Tagliabue at the Super
Bowl--I presume because he helped jack up the price for the expansion
franchise that went to Houston--and said he has come to the
conclusion, "There's just too much apathy here to make this happen."</TE>
<TE>   I didn't have the heart to tell him I really wasn't listening.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   WITHOUT FOOTBALL, though, some of the best stories are happening
elsewhere. The last-minute shift from Mariucci to Gruden, for
example, was a stunner.</TE>
<TE>   Gruden used to work in the kitchen at Hooters in Tampa, so it's
understandable why he was so interested in going back there.</TE>
<TE>   But why would the Raiders allow him to leave?</TE>
<TE>   The Raiders, never known for being responsive or forthcoming, were
in a rush to be both Monday in explaining Gruden in December was
offered a $9.5-million three-year contract extension-- that Gruden
declined to accept.</TE>
<TE>   In typical Raider fashion, they failed to mention what was in
small print. They were insisting on another three-year commitment
beyond the three-year extension, but refusing to guarantee it if he
was dismissed before the end of the deal.</TE>
<TE>   He signed a guaranteed $17.5-million five-year deal with Tampa.</TE>
<TE>   Gruden has been at odds with Davis for some time, which probably
speaks to the Raiders' success the last few years. Davis fired Mike
Shanahan, and Shanahan went on to win Super Bowls in Denver.
Defensive coordinator John Fox quit because of Davis' mettlesome ways
and is now head coach of Carolina.</TE>
<TE>   The next head coach of the Raiders will be the same head coach the
Raiders have had for decades--Al Davis.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   IT'S PROBABLY going to be more difficult than ever to prop up some
puppet to stand-in for Davis a la Mike White and Joe Bugel.</TE>
<TE>   This is a concern, because a very important golf match has become
a tradition the last three years on the first day of the NFL owners'
annual March meetings. Coliseum GM Pat Lynch and I have taken on
Raider GM Bruce Allen and the team's head coach--with the winners
claiming the football rights to Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   The last three years Allen has teamed with Gruden, which explains
why the Raiders are still in Oakland. Maybe his golf game will
improve in Tampa.</TE>
<TE>   Since it really doesn't matter who is coaching the Raiders, I
suggested Allen get in contact with James Bum Garner, although I
wouldn't ask Ovitz to help with introductions. Bum's a logical
choice, given his experience walking the Raider sidelines when they
played here, and the fact he's used to taking direction.</TE>
<TE>   Anyone who has watched his new TV show about the Supreme Court
knows he'll be available soon, and I've seen him swing a golf
club....</TE>
<TE>   Besides, Plaschke has convinced me we need a curling franchise.</TE>

<HD>He's Back, It's 'Mr. Rose' Now</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Devon Rose is finishing his first month of student teaching at North
Hollywood High, having already survived the most traumatic moment a
22-year-old barely out of college can encounter:</LD>
<LD>   A student called him "Mr. Rose" on his first day of teaching.</LD>
<LD>   "I was shocked," Rose said. "I almost wanted to say, 'Call me
Coach Rose.' It sounded so weird."</LD>
<TE>   College athletes are in no hurry to enter the real world. Many
attempt to extend their sports careers by trying out for professional
teams even if making one is a longshot.</TE>
<TE>   Rose is different. He suited up for his last football game at
Nevada Las Vegas on Nov. 18, completed requirements for his
bachelors' degree on Dec. 21, and started work at North Hollywood on
Jan. 21. There was never any hesitation to enter the final phase of
becoming a physical education teacher. The fun and games of college
life had ended.</TE>
<TE>   "Some of my friends still have another year of college," Rose
said. "Some are trying out for the NFL or Arena League. Some are
graduating. I've always wanted to coach. I enjoy being with kids."
Rose graduated from North Hollywood in 1997 and received a
scholarship to play linebacker at UNLV. Injuries to his back, hip and
wrist limited him to special teams most of his college career.</TE>
<TE>   Teaching and coaching were always on his mind. His mother has been
a teacher for more than 30 years. But making the transition from
college student to high school teacher isn't easy.</TE>
<TE>   Armed with a clipboard, whistle, No. 2 pencil and roll book, Rose
is in charge of four P.E. classes of ninth and 10th graders,
supervising 40-50 students in each class. Some want to learn, others
don't. Some want to follow instructions, others rebel.</TE>
<TE>   "You tell a kid to do something and they ask, 'Why?' When I was in
high school, I remember I had that mentality," Rose said. "If you
respect the kids, they'll respect you. When I'm out there, I'm the
one in charge. A kid is not going to tell me what to do.</TE>
<TE>   "I have kids who refuse to participate. Getting a student to do
what I want them to do and when they actually do it, makes me feel
good. Seeing the kids who want to learn and watching them get
excited, that's something I like to see."</TE>
<TE>   Learning names, having patience and maintaining control over
rambunctious teenagers are among Rose's challenges.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a little nerve-racking at first, but he seems to be in
control," said Brad Hodge, the teacher responsible for observing Rose
during his student teaching. "You have to have a little patience, a
little humor, but [also] have your discipline and rules."</TE>
<TE>   Rose plans to help coach track at North Hollywood this spring,
then decide what to do about coaching football in the fall when he
looks for a full-time teaching position. He understands the sacrifice
he is making by becoming a teacher and coach.</TE>
<TE>   "You don't go into teaching and coaching for the money," he said.
"It's something you do because you love working with kids. I love
sports and I feel I can make a difference. My high school coach,
Jason Garrison, made a difference. I feel through coaching, if I can
affect one kid in a positive way, it will be important."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   College recruiting can get out of control. Some high school
athletes like the attention and phone calls from recruiting services
trying to find out which schools are under consideration.</TE>
<TE>   Lorenzo Booker of Ventura St. Bonaventure thrived on publicity.
But receiver Steve Smith of Woodland Hills Taft is no Booker. He has
no intention of spending the next 11 months answering repeated phone
calls from people trying to find out what colleges he's considering.</TE>
<TE>   "My mom told me to be real strong and tell them to stop calling,"
Smith said.</TE>
<TE>   Smith doesn't want to be rude. He just wants to make his college
decision at his own pace, without daily interruptions. He's only a
junior, and the pressure to make a decision is already rising.</TE>
<TE>   Don't look for Smith to wait until the last day like Booker and
hold a news conference on ESPN. He prefers peace and quiet over a
media frenzy.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Chris Sailer, who was an All-American kicker at UCLA and plays in
the Arena Football League, is holding a camp March 9-10 at Sherman
Oaks Notre Dame High. Information: (818) 767-7188.</TE>
<TE>   The Football 50-yard race, scheduled for Saturday at the Los
Angeles Sports Arena as part of the Los Angeles Invitational indoor
track meet, is shaping up to be very competitive.</TE>
<TE>   Besides the Florida State-bound Booker, freshman Aaron Ware of
Westlake Village Oaks Christian is entered, along with Darnell Bing
of Long Beach Poly, Quintin Daniels of Loyola and Turrill Engelman of
Huntington Beach Marina.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   High school sports has lost one of its most enthusiastic
supporters in Dale Basey, a psychology teacher at Newhall Hart who
spent 17 years as the school's activities director. He died of an
apparent heart attack Saturday night. He was 47.</TE>
<TE>   It's a devastating loss for students and faculty because Basey was
someone they could always count on to have a positive outlook,
whether it was a good or bad day. He'll be greatly missed.</TE>

<HD>Agassi, Hewitt: Tale of Agendas</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LISA DILLMAN</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Andre Agassi hires a new coach and you could practically hear a sigh
of relief from sponsors and tournament directors, as the change
suggests a renewed commitment rather than a lessened one.</LD>
<LD>   Lleyton Hewitt parts with an old coach and you could practically
hear a collective groan from Down Under, as the switch from a highly
respected mentor who guided him to No. 1 and the U.S. Open title
seemingly represents an errant turn along the road to greatness.</LD>
<LD>   Interestingly, the coach, Darren Cahill, is at the center of both
cases. Call it Trading Places.</LD>
<TE>   Agassi, Cahill and Hewitt could all collide at next week's
tournament in San Jose. It will be Agassi's and Cahill's first
tournament together, and Hewitt's first action since a draining bout
of chickenpox led to his first-round exit at the Australian Open.</TE>
<TE>   It's not out of the question that Brad Gilbert, who had coached
Agassi since 1994, will show up since he lives in the Bay Area. Maybe
they can all have dinner when Hewitt turns 21 on Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   A coaching change--unless a player makes one every few
months--provides definition of a player's career. Agassi, who turns
32 in April, is not far from the end and this move appears to signal
one last significant charge. The last time he made such a change,
hiring Gilbert in 1994, it led to six Grand Slam singles titles, an
Olympic gold medal and the season-ending No. 1 ranking in 1999.</TE>
<TE>   Agassi's decision was easier to understand once he hired Cahill.
After all, Cahill had coached Hewitt, the new Agassi, for three years
and together they reached extraordinary success quite early, which
included victories over Agassi.</TE>
<TE>   Hewitt's move--parting with Cahill and hiring Jason
Stoltenberg--was considered controversial because it appeared
shrouded in mystery in December. Since then, Cahill has taken the
high road, not explaining what happened in his newspaper columns for
the Melbourne Age during the Australian Open.</TE>
<TE>   And the other day, Hewitt was asked about it on a conference call,
saying: "You know, it's sort of between Darren and I, and that's the
way it's going to stay pretty much the whole time as well. We just
sort of came to the end."</TE>
<TE>   In Hewitt's defense, he is hardly the first player to make a big
change early in his career. Pete Sampras won his first Grand Slam
event, the 1990 U.S. Open, at 19, and was coached by Joe Brandi.
Brandi coached Sampras in the 1990-1991 seasons. By the time Sampras
won his second Slam, Wimbledon in 1993, he was coached by Tim
Gullikson, who died in May 1996.</TE>
<TE>   If you listen closely to Hewitt, he is saying all the right
things. Though No. 1 in the Entry System rankings, Hewitt was not
completely satisfied.</TE>
<TE>   "Even though I got to No. 1, I'm not as good a player as I can
be," he said. "It's great that I've had the success that I have, but
there's still areas of my game--I'm only 20 years old--there's areas
of my game that I still know and think that I can work on and become
a better player.''</TE>
<TE>   He is a credible threat on all surfaces, having reached the
quarterfinals at the French Open and fourth round at Wimbledon last
year. His best finish at the Australian Open was the final 16 in
2000.</TE>
<TE>   "To produce the results like the U.S. Open on all different
surfaces, for me, I've got to change a few things," he said. "I think
I've definitely got to get a little bit stronger ... obviously a high
percentage of first serves, getting more cheap points off my first
serve, getting those easier points, and also becoming more of an
all-court player."</TE>
<TE>   To that end, he has spent more time working in the gym with
Stoltenberg. The chickenpox, which hit him during the season-opening
Hopman Cup in Perth, actually allowed him time to rest. Instead of
rushing back into action, prematurely, he skipped the first round of
Davis Cup at Argentina.</TE>
<TE>   The additional strength could pay off, in particular, during the
clay-court season, as he states the obvious: "I'm not the biggest guy
out there."</TE>
<TE>   He downplayed the Cahill factor in the event he should play Agassi
in San Jose.</TE>
<TE>   "I'll go out there, it's between me and Andre basically," Hewitt
said. "Last time I played Andre was in the Masters Cup. I played one
of my best matches ever. In the past, we've had extremely tough
matches."</TE>
<TE>   It would be different if Cahill had been hired by one of Hewitt's
young peers, such as Andy Roddick, Juan Carlos Ferrero or Marat
Safin. Roddick and Ferrero are in stable coaching situations, but,
Safin, who seems to have a new coach each month, had been in
discussions with Cahill before Agassi became a free agent.</TE>
<TE>   Mystery Story</TE>
<TE>   On the surface, Indian Wells would appear to be the ideal choice
for Jennifer Capriati to pick up some serious points in the ranking
race because she skipped the tournament last year. Additionally, she
will be relatively close, playing the week before in Scottsdale,
Ariz., and the Indian Wells field has been hit hard with losses at
the very top.</TE>
<TE>   Venus and Serena Williams are skipping the tournament, and Lindsay
Davenport is out, long-term, because of knee surgery.</TE>
<TE>   The top players will be Martina Hingis, Monica Seles and Kim
Clijsters, if she is recovered from recent arm trouble.</TE>
<TE>   Capriaiti's explanation raised more questions than it answered.
She said it was difficult because of the busy schedule, having
planned to play Key Biscayne, Fla., which follows Indian Wells.</TE>
<TE>   "You never know," she said. "I can't say that I won't ever play
there. I think I should keep my options open. But just for this year
and for the time being, I don't have any plans on going out there.
Maybe there's more reason behind that than I wish to comment on right
now."</TE>

<HD>Texans Make the Big Move, Taking Lineman Boselli First</HD>

<BD>Associated Press</BD>
<DL>HOUSTON</DL>
<LD>With face-painted fans shouting his name, Tony Boselli became the
Houston Texans' top pick Monday--the second time an expansion team
began building a franchise around him.</LD>
<LD>   "We have a Hall of Famer and we haven't played a game," General
Manager Charley Casserly said.</LD>
<LD>   After five Pro Bowl seasons as an offensive tackle with the
Jacksonville Jaguars, Boselli proved to be too attractive for the
Texans to pass up, even at a huge cost.</LD>
<TE>   Hundreds of Texan fans wearing blue-and-red jerseys and helmets
with bulls' horns cheered the choice of Boselli, a former USC
standout who missed most of last season because of a shoulder injury.</TE>
<TE>   He seemed equally enthused about joining the new team.</TE>
<TE>   "I've been with a group of guys that no one thought could play
before," Boselli said. "The sooner this team comes together and
becomes cohesive the sooner we can be good."</TE>
<TE>   Boselli was the first player chosen by the expansion Jaguars in
1995 and quickly became a dominate offensive lineman. He has given up
151/2 sacks in his seven pro seasons.</TE>
<TE>   The first eight choices came from three teams--the Jaguars, the
New York Jets and Baltimore Ravens, all of whom had cap problems.</TE>
<TE>   "Obviously Charley knew the teams in cap trouble--us, Baltimore
and Jacksonville," said Terry Bradway, general manager of the Jets,
who lost starting right tackle Ryan Young and starting cornerbacks
Aaron Glenn and Marcus Coleman.</TE>
<TE>   The Texans, who will play their first game against the New York
Giants on Aug. 5 in the Hall of Fame game in Canton, Ohio, also took
three players from Jacksonville--defensive tackles Seth Payne and
Gary Walker were the other selections besides Boselli. Baltimore, the
2001 Super Bowl winner, lost starting linebacker Jamie Sharper and
Jermaine Lewis, a top kicker returner.</TE>

<HD>Washington to Vote on Tyson Today</HD>

<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The three-member D.C. Boxing and Wrestling Commission is expected to
convene today to vote on whether to approve Mike Tyson for a boxing
license. If approved, it could result in a June 8 heavyweight fight
at MCI Center against Lennox Lewis.</LD>
<LD>   Tyson, whose license application was denied by Nevada on Jan. 29,
formally filed paperwork with the D.C. commission last week. To be
licensed, he needs approval from a majority of the three-member
panel.</LD>
<LD>   "If Mike is licensed [in D.C.], it's not quite a formality that we
would have the fight there, but it's pretty close to that," Shelly
Finkel, Tyson's advisor, said Monday from New York. "Of course, we
would have to get Lennox to agree, but I don't think that would be a
problem."</LD>
<TE>   D.C. Mayor Anthony A. Williams said last week he supported
bringing the Lewis-Tyson bout to the city if the commission granted a
license to Tyson.</TE>

<LD>Here it is approaching late February and UCLA is barely clinging to a
national ranking.</LD>
<LD>   The Bruins are No. 25 in the Associated Press poll, dropping five
spots after defeating Arizona and losing to Arizona State at home
last week. It is their lowest ranking of the season.</LD>
<LD>   UCLA (17-8, 9-5 in the Pacific 10 Conference) was No. 5 in the
preseason AP poll, moved up to No. 3 on Nov. 19, then began to slide,
falling to No. 20 by Dec. 3. A nine-game winning streak against
mostly mediocre opponents enabled the Bruins to climb into the top 10
for one week at No. 9 on Jan. 14, but six consecutive weeks of
splitting two games has taken its toll.</LD>
<TE>   "Kansas, Duke, Maryland and Cincinnati are playing the most
consistently best basketball in the country," Coach Steve Lavin said.
"Then there are about 30 teams in a big group."</TE>
<TE>   Among them are six Pac-10 teams scrambling for the regular-season
title and favorable seeding in the conference tournament. UCLA is
tied for fifth with the California Bears, whom the Bruins visit
Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Because the Bruins are 6-6 the last six weeks, it is possible they
will go 3-3 the next three weeks--splitting at Cal and Stanford, at
home against Oregon and Oregon State and losing in the second round
of the Pac-10 tournament.</TE>
<TE>   That would give them a 20-11 record entering the NCAA tournament.</TE>
<TE>   Where would they be seeded?</TE>
<TE>   Their victories over No. 1 Kansas, No. 5 Alabama and No. 14
Arizona will be looked upon favorably by the selection committee, but
a ho-hum February and an inability to string more than two victories
together will not.</TE>
<TE>   The Bruins rank No. 23 in the ratings percentage index used by the
NCAA in seeding teams. Unless they can patch together a winning
streak down the stretch, the highest they can expect to be seeded in
a region is fifth. A No. 6 seeding is more likely.</TE>

<LD>The Utah State and UC Irvine basketball teams appear to be battling
down to the wire for the Big West Conference regular-season
championship. With that comes the No. 1 seeding in the conference
tournament, April 7-9, at the Anaheim Convention Center.</LD>
<LD>   Either team could play Long Beach State in the first round. That
might not be the matchup that the Aggies or Anteaters--teams that
need to win the tournament to get to the NCAA tournament--are looking
for as the 49ers appear to have gotten their act together after being
adrift most of the season.</LD>
<LD>   Long Beach (10-16 overall, 6-9 in the Big West) is in a tie for
seventh place, but the 49ers have won four of their last six games.
They have pushed Utah State and Irvine to the limit, losing by four
and seven points to the Aggies and by six points to the Anteaters.</LD>
<TE>   Irvine ends the regular season Feb. 28 at the Pyramid.</TE>
<TE>   "If we can keep growing, I think we can be a threat," Long Beach
Coach Wayne Morgan said.</TE>
<TE>   The 49ers appear to be playing with a sense of purpose after
Morgan announced he would step down after the season. They are coming
off an impressive road sweep of Pacific and Cal State Northridge last
week.</TE>
<TE>   Forward Travis Reed, who has averaged over 20 points the last six
games, doesn't rule out a 49er run in the tournament.</TE>
<TE>   "There's no dominant team in the conference but there are some
good teams," Reed said. "Irvine just lost to Pacific so it's wide
open."</TE>
<TE>   Northridge Coach Bobby Braswell sees something different in the
49ers.</TE>
<TE>   "They love their coach and I'm sure they're rallying behind him,"
Braswell said.</TE>
<TE>   Cody Pearson is a walk-on at Long Beach, but the freshman guard is
showing he can do a lot more than take up a seat at the end of the
bench. Pearson has been a spark for the 49ers after originally being
slated to redshirt.</TE>
<TE>   The former Sherman Oaks Notre Dame High player has provided
tenacious defense and energy to a team desperate for a lift.</TE>
<TE>   In the 49ers' 73-60 victory against Northridge, Pearson had two
points and three rebounds in 14 minutes. But the points came on a
thunderous dunk off a missed shot.</TE>
<TE>   He also drew a charging call on Curtis Slaughter to help blunt the
Matadors' rally and nearly got into a scrap with Markus Carr after a
scramble for a loose ball.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm sure it was a sweet win for Cody," Morgan said, "especially
since we were in his old neighborhood."</TE>
<TE>   Three weeks ago, Northridge was riding a five-game winning streak
that propelled it to the top of the Big West. Since then, the
Matadors have dropped five in a row and fallen into a tie for fifth
place.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Braswell has called on his veterans, saying that only freshman
swingman Ian Boylan has been giving the kind of effort he has wanted.</TE>
<TE>   "We finished the first round [of league] 7-2 and we were feeling
good about ourselves," Braswell said. "You get a little
complacent.... Everyone in the conference has elevated their game to
a different level and we have not responded."</TE>
<TE>   Carr, the senior point guard, has an excuse with a sprained big
toe that makes it difficult to push off.</TE>
<TE>   "I try not to think about it," said Carr, who has missed 20 of 24
shots in his last two games. "I just go out and play.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't want to make any excuses. We play well for most of the
games but there have been times when our intensity level goes down."</TE>
<TE>   Braswell dismissed any notion that he might make a move for the
Long Beach State position once Morgan ends his tenure.</TE>
<TE>   When asked about his interest, the sixth-year Northridge coach
said, "None. Not at all."</TE>
<TE>   Braswell is a former Long Beach assistant (1989-92) who was a
candidate for the 49er job when Morgan was hired to succeed Seth
Greenberg in 1996.</TE>
<TE>   Northridge Athletic Director Dick Dull said he has not been
contacted by Long Beach officials about Braswell.</TE>
<TE>   Former Long Beach standout Ed Ratleff has expressed an interest in
the position.</TE>
<TE>   Ratleff, a former All-American and U.S. Olympian, was an assistant
coach in the early 1980s under Tex Winter and Ron Palmer and remains
popular in the community.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know how [Athletic Director] Bill Shumard is looking at
it," Ratleff said. "I don't know who he is looking for but I think
I'd be the perfect person."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   USC finished seventh in the TRW Regional Challenge last week at
Palos Verdes Golf Course, the highest finish among local teams.</TE>
<TE>   Junior Mikaela Parmlid shot a five-over-par 218 for the three
rounds to finish in a tie for sixth. Junior Becky Lucidi finished
10th.</TE>
<TE>   Led by freshman Yvonne Choe and sophomore Crystal Shearer, UCLA
finished eighth, four shots behind the Trojans. Junior Katharine
Hull's 14th-place showing helped Pepperdine finish 10th.</TE>
<TE>   Arizona All-American Lorena Ochoa won the tournament with a
seven-under 206.</TE>
<TE>   Tulsa, the nation's No. 2-ranked team, won the team title.</TE>
<TE>   Eric Stephens</TE>

<TE>   UC Irvine's final game of its season-opening baseball homestand
was rained out Sunday, but the Anteaters (8-5) are feeling good about
their start. Irvine, fielding a team for the first time since 1992,
travels to Tucson this weekend to play Arizona.</TE>
<TE>   It will be an interesting series in many ways. Arizona Coach Andy
Lopez, who led Pepperdine to the national title in 1992, was at
Florida and was the frontrunner for the Irvine coaching job, but he
pulled himself out of consideration after interviewing for the
position.</TE>
<TE>   Dan Guerrero, Irvine's athletic director and a friend of Lopez's,
then hired USC assistant John Savage, one of the top recruiters and
pitching coaches in the nation.</TE>
<TE>   Lopez's interview with Irvine did not endear him to Florida's
athletic administrators and he was fired after last season. He was
hired a month later by Arizona and has the Wildcats off to an 11-4
start.</TE>

<HD>Technically, Bibby Was Upset at Call</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Coach Henry Bibby minced no words Monday in expressing his feelings
on being assessed a technical foul by referee Mark Ayotte during
Saturday's 94-89 victory against Arizona.</LD>
<LD>   "It was [bull]," Bibby said. "I was talking about a foul and he
said, 'Easy, easy, easy.' I told him, 'I don't have to be easy, this
is for first place in the Pac-10.' Is that deserving of a technical
foul? It's [bull]. The technical foul was [bull].</LD>
<LD>   "If I'm annoying him that much, walk away from me. Tell me,
'Henry, I don't want to hear it' and walk away from me. You don't
give a technical foul at that point in the game. Doesn't happen. And
again, would a big-name coach get a technical foul on that? I don't
think so."</LD>
<TE>   Bibby was perturbed by the foul called on forward Sam Clancy, who
had blocked Rick Anderson's shot and sent him sprawling on a
breakaway dunk attempt with five minutes remaining in the first half
and the Trojans leading, 31-23. With Anderson at the line, the
technical was called and the Wildcats made it a four-point play.</TE>
<TE>   "It took away from the game and it took me out of ... coaching,"
Bibby said. "That's not what it's for but it shows how much the
officials can have control of a game. If I cursed the guy, it's a
different story and I never cursed the guy, never swore at the guy.
So it was totally unwarranted.</TE>
<TE>   "When I'm deserving, give me a warning ... and I can understand if
you give me a warning that I'm bothering you."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Junior center Kostas Charissis was walking with the aid of
crutches and a boot on his left foot Monday after aggravating an
ankle injury Saturday. An X-ray is scheduled for today and USC
officials fear he may be lost for up to four weeks because of a
stress fracture. Charissis starts and is averaging 10.4 minutes and
2.3 points.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Bill Simon Jr., a political novice and Republican gubernatorial
hopeful, touts his experience and accomplishments in business as
qualifications to run California, home to the fifth-largest economy in
the world.</LD>
<LD>   As he has campaigned, he has commiserated with small-business owners,
spoken of his many corporate investments and boasted of being an "oil and
gas man from way back."</LD>
<LD>   Simon is, in fact, a very rich man who has poured millions of
dollars--his own and others'--into an array of businesses involving
products from doorknobs and frozen pizzas to pay phones and storage
cabinets.</LD>
<TE>   His financial portfolio is so vast that he is not familiar with all
his holdings. It took his campaign managers six months to complete the
economic disclosure form that he was required to file for the governor's
race. The inch-thick packet details Simon's assets, some of which could
become political liabilities in his election bid.</TE>
<TE>   Simon, 50, refuses to say precisely how rich he is, and some close to
him say he tries to play down his wealth by dressing in khakis and
driving a minivan. It's safe to say he's worth tens of millions of
dollars.</TE>
<TE>   He has helped tend to a family fortune that he and his six siblings
inherited from their famous father, William E. Simon, the former U.S.
Treasury secretary who was known as one of the innovators of the
leveraged buyout craze of the 1980s. Along the way, Bill Jr. has racked
up more financial winners than losers.</TE>
<TE>   By far the most stinging financial defeat for the Simons was the $40
million they lost when the government took over Western Federal Savings
and Loan in the early 1990s--a family investment that Bill Jr. was in
charge of monitoring.</TE>
<TE>   While the father was a daring businessman who experienced both
colossal successes and hefty losses, the son's approach to investing has
largely mirrored his political philosophy: cautious and conservative.</TE>
<TE>   Dad was a home run hitter, Simon says, but he also struck out a lot.
"I hit more singles and doubles," the candidate said.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike most who would run for the highest elective office in the
state, Simon has no governmental record to speak of. He spent three years
as a federal prosecutor in New York under the tutelage of then-U.S. Atty.
Rudolph Giuliani. Simon has never held an elective office other than
president of his class at Williams College in Massachusetts.</TE>
<TE>   And, although he spends considerable time and money supporting many
charitable causes, he is a relative miser in the political arena,
contributing less than $20,000 to a few candidates over the last 10
years, records show.</TE>
<TE>14 Years Running Family Firm</TE>
<TE>   Simon's most sustained endeavor has been his 14 years at the helm of
the family's investment firm, William E. Simon &amp; Sons, which controls or
has major interests in companies with sales exceeding $2 billion and real
estate projects with a combined value of more than $1 billion.</TE>
<TE>   Although the firm seeks to do business with institutional and private
investors, much of the capital that is invested is part of the Simon
family fortune, which one former associate of the firm said "is probably
well north of $500 million."</TE>
<TE>   Interviews with current and former employees of the firm, those who
have done business with it, and others paint a generally flattering
portrait of Co-chairman William E. Simon Jr., better known as "Billy."</TE>
<TE>   More a caretaker of wealth than a creator of it, he has a knack for
hiring talented people and then stepping out of their way. Schooled as a
lawyer, he relies heavily on research, not instinct. More than anything
else, he is admired for his work ethic and refusal to rest on his
family's laurels.</TE>
<TE>   Conor T. Mullett, a former employee, said Simon was often up and on
the phone before dawn in Los Angeles so he could catch colleagues on the
East Coast first thing in the morning.</TE>
<TE>   "He's not just a guy playing on the golf course," Mullet said.</TE>
<TE>   As an investor, Simon seeks companies with solid management and
business plans that want, for the most part, silent partners and an
infusion of capital. He is a devotee of the Warren Buffett school of
investing, looking for undervalued companies with growth potential.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike his father, a mercurial presence who left a trail of bitter
business partners, Simon appears to have few enemies. He has even tried
to patch up relationships with people who feuded with his father.</TE>
<TE>   Although one of Simon's critics privately suggested that he tried to
financially ruin a widow in order to collect on a debt owed his father,
the widow said in an interview that nothing could be further from the
truth.</TE>
<TE>   Beverly Thrall said her late husband, Larry, had pledged some
properties as collateral in his highly contentious partnership with
William Simon Sr. After her husband's death, Thrall said, Bill Simon
filed a claim against the estate, as did other business associates.</TE>
<TE>   "In the case of a couple of [the properties] being sold, Bill [Jr.]
was nice enough to not make me give him his share--he could have demanded
it," Thrall said. "He couldn't have been nicer, honestly."</TE>
<TE>   Thrall's account was in keeping with an assessment of Simon given by
his stepmother, Tonia Donnelly Simon. She said that Billy lacked the
killer instinct of his father when it came to business, but that he made
up for it.</TE>
<TE>   "He reacts to need," she said in a telephone interview from her home
in Santa Barbara. "I don't like to use the word 'sweet' for a man. But he
is very sweet. He's a wonderful, sensitive person."</TE>
<TE>   When people talk of Bill Jr., the contrasts between him and Bill Sr.
inevitably come up. The senior Simon, who died in June 2000, had a
reputation for being abrupt, sometimes downright nasty. It didn't matter
if they were business partners or secretaries, his temper was legendary.</TE>
<TE>   "Billy is nothing like that," said Sean Duffy, a former employee who
works at another investment firm. "They were like night and day."</TE>
<TE>   Simon, in a recent interview, conceded that at times he was bothered
by his father's outbursts, from which neither he nor his brother was
spared. He said it was a trait that he hoped he did not inherit.</TE>
<TE>   "Dad's been dead a year and a half," he said, "so I guess if the lion
in me was going to come out, it probably would have come out by now."</TE>
<TE>   Bill Simon and his younger brother, Peter, joined forces with their
father to form William E. Simon &amp; Sons in 1988.</TE>
<TE>   From the outset, Peter Simon said, he and his brother were committed
to providing some structure to the old man's "gut feeling" school of
investing.</TE>
<TE>   "Dad was the classic entrepreneur who did everything exactly as he
wished," recalled Peter Simon. "He was just a guy that walked in in the
morning and said, 'You know what? I want to buy corn today.' He'd call up
three brokers and find out where it was and buy it."</TE>
<TE>   These days, Peter Simon said, "we don't do stuff like that."</TE>
<TE>   He said he and his brother began their mission to institutionalize the
business with the most basic of tasks.</TE>
<TE>   "The first year we were here, we did such things as write our own
policy manual for our company," Peter Simon said. "We literally sat down
and wrote it word for word ourselves."</TE>
<TE>   In the early years, both brothers agreed, the senior Simon dominated
his two sons, who at the time had little experience in the direct
investment business.</TE>
<TE>   "The first couple years Dad put us through what he subsequently
referred to as boot camp. He treated us just like everybody else," said
Bill Simon, during an interview wedged in between campaign appearances in
Huntington Beach. "Believe me, there was no difference between us and the
most junior person in the organization."</TE>
<TE>   As it exists today, William E. Simon &amp; Sons is divided into three
distinct areas:</TE>
<TE>   * Private equity, which matches big-money investors with relatively
low-risk projects in hopes of a return that beats the interest rate paid
by a traditional bank.</TE>
<TE>   * Real estate, which does essentially the same thing with properties.</TE>
<TE>   * Special situations, launched just three years ago, which looks for
"distressed" companies in which to invest on the bet that they'll regain
their footing and return to profitability. This is a far more volatile
market, designed to attract investors willing to accept a higher risk in
hopes of a higher return.</TE>
<TE>   The firm, which employs about 80 people, maintains offices in Los
Angeles and Morristown, N.J. Bill Simon moved to California about 12
years ago to open the Los Angeles office, while Peter Simon stayed in
Morristown to run operations there.</TE>
<TE>The Boss Buys Lunch</TE>
<TE>   Those in the Los Angeles office describe a very close-knit working
environment where Simon pays to have lunch brought in every day for the
staff. They see their boss as approachable, friendly and eager to hear
about new investment proposals.</TE>
<TE>   Henry Brandon, who has been at the firm seven years, said Bill Simon
"works very hard at improving himself" and is "not the kind of guy who
thinks he knows everything."</TE>
<TE>   "He's willing to learn, willing to roll up his sleeves," he said.</TE>
<TE>   One painful--and costly--lesson was the government seizure of Western
Federal in 1993. The federal takeover of the sick S&amp;L cost the Simons $40
million of their own money and the taxpayers more than twice that amount.</TE>
<TE>   The Simons' involvement in the thrift began in 1988 when the senior
Simon led an investment group, comprising several business associates, in
acquiring it. In the early 1990s, the thrift suffered millions of dollars
in loan losses caused by Southern California's prolonged real estate
slump. Plagued by those losses, the institution became undercapitalized
and ultimately was seized by federal regulators.</TE>
<TE>   Although it has been nearly a decade since Western Federal went belly
up, it's a topic that has already been seized on by Gov. Gray Davis'
campaign.</TE>
<TE>   "The only thing Bill Simon has ever led in California was a savings
and loan into the ground," Garry South, Davis' campaign consultant, has
told reporters.</TE>
<TE>   Simon, who to this day cringes at the mere mention of Western Federal,
acknowledges that it was "a really tough experience."</TE>
<TE>   But he played down his role in the thrift's failure.</TE>
<TE>   "I was not involved in the acquisition or negotiation of that one,"
said Simon, who sat on the thrift's board of directors. "I was definitely
involved in monitoring it, though. No question about it. I even had an
office there for awhile."</TE>
<TE>   Simon accused the federal government of prematurely taking over the
S&amp;L, saying government officials reneged on the terms of the deal his
father had worked out when it was purchased. Had the government not done
so, he said, he believes Western Federal would have returned to
profitability. The allegation is the subject of pending civil lawsuit by
the investors against federal regulators.</TE>
<TE>   The lesson he learned, Simon said, was "be very careful when you deal
with the government."</TE>
<TE>   Hugh H. Evans Jr., the former president of Western Fed, refused to
talk about the Simons' involvement with the institution, citing the
pending lawsuit. But he said that he bore them no ill will and that he
got along with both father and son. Although the senior Simon was
"tougher to get along with as a human being," Billy was "congenial and
collaborative," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Come election day, Evans said, "I'd sure pick him over Gray Davis."</TE>
<TE>   Not long after the Western Federal debacle, Simon Sr. began to ease
out of the business, in part due to his deteriorating health and his
desire to devote more time to charitable work.</TE>
<TE>   So from that point forward, as never before, William E. Simon &amp; Sons
was much more about the sons than the father.</TE>
<TE>Pizza, PAX-TV Among Simon Interests</TE>
<TE>   Though hardly a household name, the company has quietly bankrolled a
number of things that are: The firm owns a stake in PAX-TV, the
family-oriented network featuring "Touched by an Angel" and "Diagnosis
Murder," as well as the lesser-known 6:30 a.m. Sunday morning broadcast
"Sunday With Simon," starring--you guessed it--Bill Simon Jr.</TE>
<TE>   The firm also has interests in Wolfgang Puck frozen pizzas, the P.F.
Chang Chinese restaurant chain and Do-Able products, maker of
organizational products that line the shelves of such places as Home
Depot.</TE>
<TE>   A foray into the doorknob biz was Billy's idea, based on what he saw
as a void in an industry closely linked to the rebounding mid- to late
1990s housing market. It made more than $20 million, according to a
source outside the company who is familiar with the deal.</TE>
<TE>   Bill Simon was also his firm's head cheerleader on the PAX-TV venture.
Besides thinking it was a good investment, he said, he felt strongly
about seeing more family-based programs on TV.</TE>
<TE>   "His involvement came right at the start-up," said PAX President Jeff
Sagansky, former president of CBS Entertainment. "It was crucial. He went
out on the road, took two weeks of his life, put it on hold, and went
around the country to help us raise [$275 million] to help us buy
stations."</TE>
<TE>   Though it has yet to turn a profit for Simon, the network is
well-positioned to do so in the future, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Decidedly less impressive was the decision to invest in pay phones
just as cell phones were on the brink of ubiquity.</TE>
<TE>   "My wife said to me, 'Why do you want to invest in a pay phone
company? Nobody uses pay phones anymore,' " Bill Simon recalled. "I said,
'No, no, no. You don't understand. No matter how much mobile phones come
in, there's always going to be a need for pay phones.' "</TE>
<TE>   Looking back on the conversation and shaking his head sheepishly, he
said, "I feel so stupid."</TE>
<TE>   The technology and dot-com dive in recent years has taken a toll on
some of the firm's investments, with at least one--MValue.com--going out
of business altogether.</TE>
<TE>   Overall, however, Simon said, "the successes, the things I'm proud of,
greatly outweigh the kind of things where I think, 'Gee whiz, that's too
bad.' "</TE>
<TE>   Asked about the accomplishments he's most proud of, Simon talked about
people he had hired rather than deals he had closed.</TE>
<TE>   "It's so important who you surround yourself with, whether it be in
business or charity or politics," he said. "People are so important. I
learned that lesson early on."</TE>
<TE>   Of himself, he offered a somewhat modest assessment.</TE>
<TE>   He rates an "A minus, B plus" as a businessman, he said. And "I won't
sit here and tell you I'm a genius, because I don't think of myself in
that way."</TE>
<TE>   He's also aware of the criticism "that I started on third base and
think I hit a triple," Simon said, punctuating the statement with a
hearty laugh.</TE>
<TE>   He made no effort to diminish the fact that his father had earned a
great deal of money by the time the brothers went into business with him.</TE>
<TE>   But rather than squander the family fortune, he's added to it, he
said.</TE>
<TE>   He has also followed in his father's footsteps with his increasing
involvement in charity work, which last year accounted for about half of
his time, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Simon said he sees an overlap between his business experience and
volunteer work with charities that would serve him well in the governor's
office.</TE>
<TE>   "The similarity between charity and business for me is that sometimes
I see things and I say, 'Boy, I tell you, we could make a difference
there, or we could make money there,' " Simon said. "Business, of course,
is: We could make money. And charity is: We could make a difference."</TE>
<TE>   In his bid for governor, some of Simon's financial assets could become
political liabilities.</TE>
<TE>   For example, he owns stock in El Paso Natural Gas, which has been
accused of taking advantage of California's energy woes by creating an
artificial supply shortage that sent prices soaring. El Paso Natural Gas
officials deny the charges.</TE>
<TE>   Hanover Compressor Co., another company in which Simon owns
significant shares and on whose board he once sat, is now mired in
controversy over its accounting practices and ties to energy giant Enron.
Simon's tenure on the board, however, predated the period now under
scrutiny.</TE>
<TE>   Should he become governor, Simon said, he would immediately take
himself out of all investment decisions and business relationships that
could be perceived as conflicts of interest.</TE>
<TE>   Over the last year, as he has campaigned, Simon has taken a leave of
absence from his firm.</TE>
<TE>   In the event he is unsuccessful in his bid for the Republican
nomination, he quipped, "I hope they'll take me back."</TE>

<HD>Big Screen Furor-Rama in Hollywood</HD>

<AU>ROBERT W. WELKOS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>To a generation of moviegoers, the Cinerama Dome at Sunset
Boulevard and Ivar Avenue in Hollywood was a Los Angeles cultural
landmark, its quirky, geodesic-shaped theater a place where one could see
wide-screen movies as they were meant to be seen, and a place that helped
inspire filmmakers entranced by movies like Steven Spielberg's "Close
Encounters of the Third Kind."</LD>
<LD>   But now, just as Cinerama's unique method of movie projection is about
to celebrate its 50th anniversary, a debate is raging in Hollywood over
plans by the dome's owners to install a new giant curved screen that
critics guarantee will make Cinerama movies, as well as many conventional
ones, appear out of focus.</LD>
<LD>   Only in Hollywood, with its heavy concentration of film industry
professionals and serious movie buffs, could the design of a movie screen
provoke such concern, and even outrage.</LD>
<TE>   In March, Pacific Theatres Corp. plans to reopen a refurbished
Cinerama Dome after a multimillion-dollar face lift that began after the
theater was closed in the summer of 2000.</TE>
<TE>   The project is not far from Hollywood's other major redevelopment
projects of recent years--the El Capitan Theater and the new Hollywood
and Highland mall, where the Kodak Theater will play host March 24 to the
Academy Awards.</TE>
<TE>   With its New York World's Fair-style design, the 250,000-square-foot
Cinerama Dome site will include retail shops, a 24-hour health club and a
seven-level, 1,750-space parking structure that cost $32 million.</TE>
<TE>   An additional 14 theaters will be built at the site. Although
Hollywood is home to a handful of historic theaters--Grauman's Chinese
and the El Capitan--the area is considered "underscreened" compared to
other neighborhoods.</TE>
<TE>   It was the public's long-standing affection for Cinerama that
persuaded Pacific Theatres and the Los Angeles Community Redevelopment
Agency to restore "three-projector" or "three-strip" Cinerama movies at
the dome as part of a $100-million-plus renovation now underway.</TE>
<TE>   Joined by local preservationists in their crusade, industry observers
and film buffs complain that despite the expenditure of millions of
dollars on the project, movies at the new Cinerama Dome will have the
same visual distortions that plagued the old dome for many years.</TE>
<TE>   They are frustrated that Pacific Theatres, which has roots in Southern
California dating to 1946 and has owned the rights to Cinerama since the
early 1960s, has decided to install a solid-sheet screen in the
refurbished theater rather than a louvered screen like the one that
graced the dome when it opened in 1963 and remained there for a decade.</TE>
<TE>   They fear that if Pacific Theatres uses a solid-sheet screen, it will
create the same focus problems that caused movies in the old dome to
appear washed out as a result of light bouncing from one side of the
deeply curved screen to the other.</TE>
<TE>Conflict of Image vs. Sound System</TE>
<TE>   "It's sad," said Robert W. Nudelman, director of preservation issues
for Hollywood Heritage, a group dedicated to preserving Hollywood's past.
"They spent a bundle putting that all together. Then they get to the
5-yard line and fumble the ball."</TE>
<TE>   But the conflict appears to pit a vintage film technology against
today's state-of-the-art sound systems. Pacific Theatres says its massive
new sound system would cause movement in the screen's louvers, which also
could distort the projected image.</TE>
<TE>   Although the Cinerama Dome has been a mecca for fans wanting to see
wide-screen movies, there was a certain irony to the fact that it never
actually screened any of the classic three-projector Cinerama movies. The
1962 epic "How the West Was Won," for example, was shown at the old
Warner Cinerama Hollywood.</TE>
<TE>   By the early 1960s, Hollywood came to favor one-projector, wide-screen
formats like CinemaScope, Todd-AO and VistaVision. The first movie to
premiere at the dome was the 1963 madcap ensemble comedy "It's a Mad,
Mad, Mad, Mad World," which was hyped as Cinerama but was actually filmed
in single-camera Ultra Panavision 70.</TE>
<TE>   Only a few classic, three-projector Cinerama films were ever made.
They include "How the West Was Won,' the 1962 fairy tale adaptation "The
Wonderful World of the Brothers Grimm" and a handful of travelogues.
There aren't any new Cinerama features in the works.</TE>
<TE>   Still, there was something about seeing movies at the Cinerama Dome
that could draw large crowds. When the theater closed for repairs two
summers ago, throngs of fans turned out for a special final weekend of
screenings of "Ben-Hur," "Lawrence of Arabia" and "Terminator 2: Judgment
Day."</TE>
<TE>   "There were people out in the street smacking each other around trying
to get tickets," said film editor Jack Tucker. "This is an example of how
much people care about this theater. Pacific seems to think this is just
another theater. To me, it's almost a holy place."</TE>
<TE>   Pacific executives say they are passionate about Cinerama and remain
fully committed to building the finest theater venue possible to showcase
it, one that will not only screen original three-projector Cinerama
movies, but also offer today's wide-screen films while restoring the
tattered theater complex to the glamour of its heyday.</TE>
<TE>   "We've really gone to all efforts to make sure we can bring back the
majesty of the original building," said Nora Dashwood, chief of theater
operations at Pacific Theatres, which operates about 450 screens in
California and Hawaii.</TE>
<TE>   When asked whether she could guarantee that the films shown in the
renovated dome will be crystal clear, Dashwood replied: "I guarantee we
will have a clear presentation, which has to be in order for it to be a
top-grossing and favorite place to go see a movie."</TE>
<TE>Taking Pains to Restore Projection Booth</TE>
<TE>   To that end, the owners are dusting off the projectors and restoring
the projection booth just so it can have three projectors for Cinerama.
Warner Bros. is also restoring MGM's "How the West Was Won" while Pacific
is restoring the original Cinerama feature, the 1952 "This Is Cinerama."</TE>
<TE>   In conventional filmmaking, movies are shot with a single camera
equipped with a single lens, then projected onto a screen with one
projector.</TE>
<TE>   Three-strip Cinerama required the use of a single camera outfitted
with three lenses and three separate negative elements, and it was shown
in theaters by using three projectors.</TE>
<TE>   One of the key features of the new Cinerama Dome will be the use, at
long last, of all three projection booths, which were originally designed
to show Cinerama movies in all their breathtaking sweep.</TE>
<TE>   Under a 1998 agreement reached between Pacific Theatres and the
Community Redevelopment Agency, which are partners in redeveloping the
site, Pacific agreed to retain the curved screen. However, the agreement
makes no mention of what type of screen Pacific would install.</TE>
<TE>   To get around the visual distortions inherent in a curved screen,
early Cinerama movies were projected onto louvered screens, which
consisted of a series of perforated vertical strips.</TE>
<TE>   Until last fall, Pacific Theatres had indicated it would install the
signature louvered screen. But the controversy places today's film
exhibition technology at odds with the process invented back when Harry
Truman occupied the White House.</TE>
<TE>'Bunch of Little Black Scratches'</TE>
<TE>   A key reason Pacific executives have decided against installing a
louvered screen is the state-of-the-art sound system envisioned for the
dome.</TE>
<TE>   If the sound causes too much vibration, Dashwood said, the vertical
lines between the strips of a louvered screen can appear like a "bunch of
little black scratches" to the audience because the strips are moving.</TE>
<TE>   "Our experts came back and said, 'You cannot put this stripped screen
in front of the sound systems of today and not expect movement to go
along with it,' " Dashwood said. "They've tried different things. They
tried to see if they could put fish line through them to kind of hold
them in place. Velcro them. To date, there just hasn't been a solution
that we feel confident in."</TE>
<TE>Enthusiasts Seek to Pressure Owners</TE>
<TE>   But that argument doesn't wash with critics, who say louvered screens
work well if the vertical strips are properly braced.</TE>
<TE>   Pacific's decision to use a solid screen, critics say, won't solve
anything because stretching a solid white sheet across a curved surface
creates "belly sag" in the center of the screen, making it difficult for
a projectionist to achieve proper focus.</TE>
<TE>   "We know it didn't work before, so why would it work now?" film editor
Doug Haines said of the solid-sheet screen. "We are not telling them to
make some sort of huge investment to make some perfect theater so that,
in our fantasies, it would be the greatest theater in the world. Just
make it acceptable so it doesn't look horrible."</TE>
<TE>   Film buffs are so concerned about getting Cinerama right at the dome
that they are marshaling their forces, hoping to pressure Pacific
Theatres into changing its stance.</TE>
<TE>   To that end, organizations representing Hollywood editors and
cinematographers, as well as individuals such as Sam Raimi, director of
this summer's comic book action film "Spider-Man," and Allen Daviau, the
cinematographer on Spielberg's "E.T.: The Extra-Terrestrial," have
written letters of concern to Pacific Theatres.</TE>
<TE>   Former studio executive Laura Ziskin, who is producing this year's
Academy Awards show and Raimi's "Spider-Man," urged the theater chain in
a letter dated Jan. 18 to "finally resolve the image problems that have
long plagued the historic venue."</TE>
<TE>   But Dashwood said she is confident that when the theater reopens,
audiences will sit down and their "jaws will drop and they'll say, 'Oh,
my gosh, this is just terrific!' "</TE>
<TE>   She also dismisses criticism that Pacific might be going with the
solid screen simply to cut costs. A solid screen, she said, costs
$25,000--a drop in the bucket compared with the overall renovation costs
at the theater--and a louvered screen would add only $20,000 more.</TE>
<TE>   But even if new audiences thrill to Cinerama, there is no way today's
audiences can ever relive what it was like when their parents and
grandparents first experienced the wonder of seeing a Cinerama movie in
its infancy.</TE>
<TE>   Narrated by broadcaster and adventurer Lowell Thomas, "This Is
Cinerama" made its debut Sept. 30, 1952, at the Broadway Theater in New
York and went on to become the highest-grossing film of the year.</TE>
<TE>   There was never a need to rush out and see a Cinerama movie for fear
that it would quickly be pulled by the exhibitor as so many movies are
today.</TE>
<TE>   "This Is Cinerama" played for three years without a break, and "How
the West Was Won" played for about two years.</TE>

<HD>Past Imperfect, Skating Aims to Score Big With Reforms</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HELENE ELLIOTT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SALT LAKE CITY
</DL>
<LD>Under fire to reform a judging system that last week produced one
of the biggest scandals in the history of the Winter Olympics, the
president of the International Skating Union proposed sweeping changes
Monday in the way figure skating is scored.</LD>
<LD>   The proposal, described by ISU President Ottavio Cinquanta of Italy as
"a total revolution" and approved unanimously by the ISU's executive
council, would scrap the traditional perfect 6.0 score. Instead, it would
produce double-digit scores based on points for the difficulty and
execution of jumps, spins and other elements on a scale to be determined
by the ISU's technical committee.</LD>
<LD>   In one key change, the judging panel would be expanded from nine to
14, but only seven of those scores would be randomly chosen to count
toward the mark for each skater or pair, limiting the possibility of a
repeat of the alleged improprieties at the Salt Lake Games.</LD>
<TE>   "I promise this system will reduce to a minimum the possibility of
bloc judging," Cinquanta said.</TE>
<TE>   Before it is adopted, the proposal must be approved by a two-thirds
vote at the ISU Congress in June at Kyoto, Japan. Cinquanta said he would
have to flesh out the proposal and then ask the congress to approve an
urgent motion to put it on the agenda.</TE>
<TE>   Bloc voting and deal-making among judges and national federations have
long been considered two of the sport's dirty little secrets.</TE>
<TE>   Those secrets were exposed after the Olympic pairs competition, when
French judge Marie Reine Le Gougne said she had been pressured to vote a
certain way and was suspended indefinitely by the ISU for failing to
report that approach before she officiated at the event.</TE>
<TE>   Le Gougne was among the judges who ranked Elena Berezhnaya and Anton
Sikharulidze of Russia ahead of Jamie Sale and David Pelletier of Canada
in the long program, contributing toward the Russians' 5-4 margin in that
phase and their gold medal triumph. The decision was unpopular, and
public outcry intensified when Le Gougne's ethics breach was revealed
amid charges of vote-swapping, coercion and physical threats.</TE>
<TE>   The dispute mushroomed into a dark cloud that hovered for several days
over these tightly policed but otherwise smoothly run Games. The frenzy
abated when the International Olympic Committee accepted the ISU's
recommendation to elevate Sale and Pelletier to co-gold medalists with
Berezhnaya and Sikharulidze.</TE>
<TE>   In other developments Monday, Cinquanta said the ISU has formally
appointed a commission to investigate the pairs judging imbroglio. Le
Gougne reportedly had wanted to speak at Monday's executive council
session but was not invited to do so.</TE>
<TE>   "She will have an opportunity to be heard," Cinquanta said.</TE>
<TE>   Speaking publicly for the first time, Le Gougne told the French sports
magazine L'Equipe that she never made a deal involving the competitors.</TE>
<TE>   "I judged in my soul and conscience," she told the paper. "I
considered that the Russians were the best."</TE>
<TE>   She also accused Sally-Anne Stapleford, head of the ISU's prestigious
technical committee, of verbally abusing and physically threatening her
over her vote. She said Stapleford was part of a Canadian conspiracy to
award the gold medal to the Canadians.</TE>
<TE>   Stapleford, who lives in London and holds a Canadian passport, denied
those allegations.</TE>
<TE>   "There was a conversation with the judge that was witnessed by some
other people," she said, referring to judges John Jackson of the U.S.,
Britta Lindgren of Sweden and Walburga Grimm of Germany. "We did report
the contents of the discussion and did hand it on to Mr. Cinquanta."</TE>
<TE>   The key features of Cinquanta's proposal are expanding the judging
panel and random computer selection of which judges' scores will count.
If judges or national federations don't know who is merely punching a
button on a computer and whose vote is included in the final tally, they
theoretically would have less motivation to pressure a judge to vote one
way or another.</TE>
<TE>   "Suppose I want to cheat," he said. "I want to ask a judge to help my
skater. I don't know if the judge who is going into the room with my
money is voting."</TE>
<TE>   Judges on the panel would not know if the scores they had entered had
been counted. However, Cinquanta said a computer at the ISU's
headquarters in Lausanne, Switzerland, would track the votes to determine
whether any judge showed a pattern of bias or incompetence over time.</TE>
<TE>   "If one judge has given [a rating of] mediocre to a triple axel-triple
toe that is perfect," Cinquanta said of the difficult combination jump,
"something is wrong. Either he is blind or isn't using the system
properly and we will say, 'You need to take a rest for a couple of
years.' "</TE>
<TE>   A judging reform package centered on loosening the ties between judges
and their national federations to promote impartiality was rejected by
the ISU two years ago. It focused on allowing the ISU to oversee the
selection of judges, instead of the individual federations.</TE>
<TE>   However, the furor raised by the recent pairs judging controversy
could create a climate that's more friendly to reform.</TE>
<TE>   Whether these reforms will have the desired effect, though, is another
matter.</TE>
<TE>   The Canadian pair skaters whose performance ignited the judging
controversy said Monday in Los Angeles that they didn't have enough
information on the proposed changes to comment.</TE>
<TE>   "The perfect system doesn't exist. . . . I think only time will see if
this is really better or not," said Pelletier, who along with Sale was in
town to appear on "The Tonight Show with Jay Leno."</TE>
<TE>   Frank Carroll, who coached Tim Goebel to a U.S. title last year and to
the Olympic bronze medal last week and has long been a critic of bloc
voting, was skeptical about seeing an end to judges' skulduggery.</TE>
<TE>   "They still can pick their deals. This isn't going to change
anything," Carroll said from his Palm Springs home.</TE>
<TE>   "Those countries that have done it before will sit down and say, 'If
this happens, we'll do this, and if that happens, we'll do that.' . . .
In some of these cultures, they wheel and deal and get through life that
way. It's not our way and Canada's way. These other countries, they think
all the furor [over the Olympic judging] is ridiculous."</TE>
<TE>   John Nicks, who will coach Sasha Cohen in the women's Olympic
competition and has competed in or coached at 12 Olympics, also voiced
skepticism because skaters and competitors have not been involved in
crafting the proposal.</TE>
<TE>   "I think after the events of this week and many years, any change and
idea is refreshing and worth considering," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "It sounds rather complicated, and I hope all the ramifications have
been considered. . . . Usually, when something is being considered,
there's talk about it. I applaud any ideas and suggestions to improve the
system, but I really hope at some point the coaching community and the
competitors would be consulted."</TE>
<TE>   U.S. Figure Skating Assn. President Phyllis Howard expressed similar
caution in a statement.</TE>
<TE>   "The USFSA fully supports any initiative that will increase the
opportunity for all athletes in all disciplines to compete on a level
playing field and be fairly judged," she said. "At the same time, the
USFSA is cautious about commenting further about any proposal until we
have the opportunity to fully examine any suggested changes to the
current judging system."</TE>
<TE>   Linda Fratianne, who lost the 1980 Olympic gold medal to Anett
Poetzsch of East Germany in a decision many observers said was based on
bloc voting, hailed the possible reforms as "a good start."</TE>
<TE>   She added, "It's a step in the right direction. This has been an
acknowledged problem for everybody in our sport. My daughter Ali and I
were watching the figure skating coverage and I told her the Canadians
were going to get a gold medal. And her reaction was, 'Mommy, you should
get a gold too.' "</TE>

<HD>Killer's Sentence of Death Debated</HD>
<DH>Law: A Ga. inmate who murdered a girl when he was 17 is delusional.
His looming execution raises issues about putting to death a
'synthetically sane' young offender.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HENRY WEINSTEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A man who is so delusional that he believes actress Sigourney
Weaver is God and that she speaks to him is scheduled to be executed
Wednesday in Georgia, amid growing protests from human rights groups and
mental health organizations.</LD>
<LD>   The case of Alexander E. Williams IV, who is forcibly medicated by
prison officials, raises a thorny legal issue that has never been
resolved by the U.S. Supreme Court. Williams was 17 when he murdered a
teenage model in Augusta, Ga.</LD>
<LD>   In 1986, the Supreme Court prohibited the execution of murderers who
have become so insane that they do not know they are about to be killed
and the reason for it. But the high court has never ruled on the issue of
whether it is permissible to execute an inmate who is medicated to
achieve a minimum level of sanity.</LD>
<TE>   Williams' attorneys are asking the Georgia Board of Pardons and
Paroles to grant clemency to Williams, who has been characterized as a
"chronic paranoid schizophrenic" by prison doctors. The five-member board
is scheduled to meet in closed session on the attorneys' request today
and to hear from the murder victim's mother later in the day.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, Williams' attorneys have asked the Supreme Court to grant
a stay of execution pending further review of the case. In papers they
filed Friday, attorneys Mark E. Oliver and Timothy K. Ford cite two
principal reasons for a stay--Williams' mental condition and the fact
that he was a juvenile when he committed the murder in 1986.</TE>
<TE>   On the first issue, the attorneys are urging the Supreme Court to bar
Georgia from executing their client while he is "synthetically sane" as a
result of forced medication. They are asking the high court to follow a
1992 ruling of the Louisiana Supreme Court, which held that forcibly
medicating insane inmates so they can be executed is unconstitutional.</TE>
<TE>   The attorneys also are asking the Supreme Court to reconsider its 1989
decision in Stanford vs. Kentucky when the justices ruled that it was
permissible to execute someone for a murder committed under the age of
18. This ruling came just one year after the court held that a killer had
to be at least 16 years old for it to be constitutional to execute him.</TE>
<TE>   Fifteen of the 38 states that have capital punishment laws prohibit
the execution of juveniles. Five other states with death penalty laws are
considering similar prohibitions on executing juveniles.</TE>
<TE>   Williams' lawyers cite scientific research indicating that a person's
mind is not fully developed until 18--the age at which individuals become
eligible to vote, enlist in the military without parental consent and
sign a binding contract.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, the practice of executing an individual for a crime
committed while a juvenile has become increasingly controversial around
the world. In the last three years, only the U.S., Iran and the
Democratic Republic of the Congo have executed people for crimes
committed under the age of 18.</TE>
<TE>   Juvenile executions are barred under several major international
treaties, including the International Covenant on Civil and Political
Rights. The U.S. Senate ratified the treaty in 1992 but specifically
reserved the right to permit executions in this country for crimes
committed under the age of 18.</TE>
<TE>   Former First Lady Rosalyn Carter, the American Bar Assn., Amnesty
International, the European Union, the National Mental Health Assn. and
even five of the jurors who voted in favor of a death sentence for
Williams are among those who have urged the Georgia Board of Pardon and
Paroles to commute his sentence to a life term.</TE>
<TE>   Danny Craig, the district attorney in Augusta, declined comment but
will accompany the victim's mother--who favors imposition of the death
sentence--to the parole board today.</TE>
<TE>   There is no debate about the fact that Williams kidnapped Aleta Carol
Bunch, a conscientious 16-year-old high school student, from an Augusta
shopping mall where she was buying her mother a birthday present.</TE>
<TE>   Williams drove Bunch to the woods in her blue 1984 Mustang, raped her
and shot her four times in the head. Williams then used her car and her
credit cards and gave some of her jewelry to his friends.</TE>
<TE>   He was convicted by a jury in August 1986 of rape, robbery,
kidnapping, murder and financial transaction fraud. He was sentenced to
death. The convictions and sentence were upheld by the Georgia Supreme
Court, and the U.S. Supreme Court declined review.</TE>
<TE>   Since some of Williams' friends testified that he had confessed the
crime to them, it was hardly surprising that he was convicted. The
question of punishment was not so clear, however. One juror urged a life
sentence but eventually was persuaded by other jurors to change his mind,
according to affidavits submitted by other jurors years after the trial.</TE>
<TE>   As a child, Williams was struck by his mother with cooking utensils,
electrical cords and a hammer and was forced to stand naked outside their
house in broad daylight, according to statements from his brother and
father.</TE>
<TE>   His stepfather and grandmother beat him too, the latter using the heel
of a glass slipper and tree branches, court documents show.</TE>
<TE>   But Williams' court-appointed lawyer, O.L. Collins, failed to present
any information about Williams' mental problems or child abuse to the
jury when the poor black teenager was sentenced to death.</TE>
<TE>   During the penalty phase, Collins called only three witnesses to
present mitigating evidence--including Williams' mother, who had beaten
him for years. She told the jury during brief testimony that her son was
a nice boy who collected comic books and coins.</TE>
<TE>   In his 15-minute closing argument, Collins raised no legal issues,
expressed his support of the death penalty, said he could "think of
nothing worse than [spending] the rest of your life behind bars in jail"
and told the jury that the murder victim "is better off in the arms of
her God" than his client awaiting his fate.</TE>
<TE>   A few years later, Collins was removed from the list of attorneys
approved to handle capital cases in Georgia. He is now dead.</TE>
<TE>   However, a federal district judge in Augusta and the U.S. 11th Circuit
Court of Appeals in Atlanta rejected claims by Williams' appellate
lawyers that Collins and another attorney who handled the first phase of
his appeal had rendered constitutionally deficient representation.</TE>
<TE>   Collins did not attempt to have Williams diagnosed at the time of
trial. But shortly after he arrived on death row, testing found that
"Williams shows evidence of substantial, generalized psychotic illness."</TE>
<TE>   Now, 33, Williams has been diagnosed with schizophrenia and suffers
from a variety of hallucinations, according to prison medical records.</TE>
<TE>   In the papers Williams' attorneys submitted to the U.S. Supreme Court,
they cite numerous reports filed by prison doctors and psychologists, who
examined Williams at death row in Jackson, Ga., over the last dozen
years, describing his severe mental illness--including "chronic paranoid
delusions."</TE>
<TE>   In 1990, Williams attacked one of his attorneys in prison. Asked why,
he told a prison psychologist that "a little red man in the attorney's
eye had something to do with it."</TE>
<TE>   In 1992, one physician wrote, "it appears that he is suffering from a
schizophrenic process that is probably life long." The doctor also noted
that "Williams did not appear to have a manipulative quality about his
thinking."</TE>
<TE>   The following year, another doctor wrote, "It does not take much
probing and questioning to realize that he is out of touch with reality."</TE>
<TE>   In 1995, the same doctor wrote, "Mr. Williams is aware that his
thoughts are more psychotic and he is in fantasy/magical world where
Sigourney Weaver is his God as well as the real world of G-3."</TE>
<TE>   In 1997, prison officials reported that Williams "was seen pacing in
his cell, wearing a mask made out of a sheet, acting as if he was the
Lone Ranger."</TE>
<TE>   The records show that in recent years prison officials have issued
orders stating that Williams can be forcibly medicated, including one in
September that lasts for six months. Several reports filed since
September--including one in late January--describe Williams as
"delusional."</TE>
<TE>   The attorneys also emphasize in the papers filed Friday that on the
day Williams is scheduled to be executed, the Supreme Court is set to
hear arguments on whether the 8th Amendment's bar of cruel and unusual
punishment prohibits executing the mentally retarded. Since the outcome
of that case is based on similar issues to those being raised by
Williams, the attorneys are asking the high court to at least postpone
his execution until the retardation issue is resolved.</TE>
<TE>   Five of the jurors who sentenced Williams to death have now urged the
parole board to grant clemency for Williams, meaning that he would
receive a life sentence instead.</TE>
<TE>   The jurors have submitted affidavits to the board saying that if they
had known about Williams' troubled childhood and mental problems they
would not have voted in favor of the death penalty.</TE>
<TE>   "The one thing about Mr. Williams' trial that stands out in my mind is
the fact that we knew so little about him as a person," juror Charles
Walker wrote. "His lawyer really told us nothing about him or his
background. I thought that Mr. Williams was not right in the head, but we
were given no information at trial about this one way or another."</TE>
<TE>   The Georgia Attorney General's office has not yet responded to the
latest motion filed in the Supreme Court by Williams' attorneys. However,
in an official briefing paper on the case posted on its Web site, it has
attempted to cast doubts about Williams' mental illness and when it
started.</TE>
<TE>   The paper notes that after Williams was convicted, a new lawyer spoke
to his mother, who informed the attorney that in 1985, the year before
the murder, she had sent her son to a regional mental hospital for an
evaluation.</TE>
<TE>   The attorney spoke to a psychiatrist, who was the facility's director.
The doctor told him that "there was nothing to indicate Williams suffered
from schizophrenia or had any other mental disorder and that there was no
reason to conduct another evaluation of him" because Williams was "just a
sociopath," according to court records.</TE>
<TE>   Although it is not certain when Williams' mental problems began, his
attorneys and mental health experts say the severity of his condition is
no longer in doubt. In a letter sent to the Georgia Board of Pardons and
Paroles, Laurie Flynn of the National Alliance for the Mentally Ill noted
that under a 1990 Supreme Court decision it is quite difficult to obtain
involuntary medication orders for inmates with mental illnesses.</TE>
<TE>   To administer involuntary medications, states must prove that an
inmate is a danger to himself or others and that the treatment is in the
inmate's best interests, the decision holds. Nonetheless, Flynn added,
the prison medical records demonstrate that Williams "remains psychotic
even when he takes anti-psychotic medications," Flynn added.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to the mental health focus, Williams' attorneys, in their
clemency petition to the parole board, emphasize the growing trend
against juvenile executions around the world and pointedly appeal to
Georgia's sense of pride as a sophisticated, contemporary state:</TE>
<TE>   "As home to the 1996 Olympic Games, CNN, and major multinational
corporations such as Coca Cola, Georgia has developed a global reputation
as a modern, international state. That reputation is at stake in the case
of Alexander Williams. The world is watching this board to see if Georgia
truly is a member of the international community or a rogue state, to be
viewed like Iran, that flouts international law and internationally
accepted human rights standards of decency."</TE>

<HD>4 New Vaults Full of Bodies Found at Ga. Crematory</HD>

<DL>NOBLE, Ga.
</DL>
<LD>The ghoulish discoveries at a rural crematory worsened Monday when
incredulous investigators opened four steel vaults packed with more
bodies.</LD>
<LD>   By nightfall Monday, the remains of 139 bodies had been collected, and
investigators feared that upward of 200 more may be unaccounted for.</LD>
<LD>   Because some of the remains appear between 10 and 20 years old,
authorities said Monday they need to speak with Ray Marsh, who started
Tri-State Crematory about 27 years ago before turning it over to his son
in 1996. But the elderly Marsh's health is too poor at this time to
withstand questioning, they said.</LD>
<TE>   The macabre mystery is all the more stunning for residents in this
everyone-knows-everybody burg because the Marsh family was well-regarded
in the community.</TE>
<TE>   Marsh is known here as a successful entrepreneur who once operated a
heavy equipment business and lumber mill. He got into the business of
death about 30 years ago because he had a backhoe, and a friend asked him
to dig some graves.</TE>
<TE>   One thing led to another; Marsh became a professional gravedigger, and
began constructing metal vaults to protect interred caskets. Then he
opened the crematory, charging funeral homes from $200 to $300 to
incinerate each body. A few years ago, he opened a cemetery, Marsh
Memorial Gardens, just down the street in this unincorporated town of
about 300.</TE>
<TE>   "Mr. Marsh was so generous," said Barbara Berry, the Walker County
elections clerk. "My aunt was buried in Marsh cemetery, and we didn't
have to pay anything."</TE>
<TE>   On corporate papers, Ray Marsh's wife, Clara, is listed as
secretary-treasurer, but investigators said Monday they don't believe she
was involved in the daily operations of the family business.</TE>
<TE>   Until her retirement, Clara Marsh was a lifelong local teacher, loved
by the community. In 1995 she was named the Walker County Citizen of the
Year for her work in education.</TE>
<TE>   Detectives do want to interrogate the couple's 28-year-old son, Brent,
who took over the crematory in 1996 after his father fell ill.</TE>
<TE>   The younger Marsh, who earlier cooperated with investigators, is being
held without bail in the county jail. He was arrested Saturday, released
on bail Sunday and arrested again late Sunday night when more bodies were
found. He may be arraigned as early as today on 17 felony counts of theft
by fraud for allegedly taking 17 bodies for incineration but not
performing the service. Each count carries a one- to 15-year prison
sentence.</TE>
<TE>   Brent Marsh, said those who know him, seemed destined for great things
in the local business community, an "up-and-comer." He attended the
University of Tennessee at Chattanooga, about 30 miles to the north, on a
football scholarship, and returned home just in time to take over the
crematory.</TE>
<TE>   He plunged into civic affairs as well. He is active in his church and
serves on the citizens committee that oversees the county's Department of
Family and Children's Services, helping advise on matters of welfare
payments and the foster children program. He also sits on the tax
equalization board, helping resolve property tax disputes.</TE>
<TE>   The Marshes' reputation began unraveling Friday with the discovery of
a skull on the crematory's 16 acres.</TE>
<TE>   Investigators said Monday they were awaiting the arrival of a forensic
anthropologist to empty the contents of the four vaults found Monday.
Other bodies have been discovered stacked in a storage shed and in a
fifth vault found Sunday. Bones have been found scattered across the
grounds.</TE>
<TE>   Of the 139 body remains recovered so far, 27 have been identified.
Earlier estimates put the number of discarded bodies at 200, but
authorities now fear the number may be much greater. Just since 1996, 350
bodies had been delivered to Tri-State Crematory, according to records
from funeral homes in northern Georgia, southern Tennessee and eastern
Alabama.</TE>
<TE>   Investigators are now asking the funeral homes to search records
before 1996.</TE>
<TE>   At a news conference Monday, Dr. Kris Sperry, the state's chief
medical examiner, said that all five vaults--each about 7 feet long, 4
feet wide and 4 feet tall--were filled to the brim with human remains.</TE>
<TE>   "I can't even begin to guess how many bodies may be in those vaults,"
Sperry told reporters. "The volume of what we're finding is growing by
the hour."</TE>
<TE>   The only explanation offered so far by Brent Marsh, according to
investigators: The incinerator was broken.</TE>
<TE>   By Monday, more than 400 people were assigned to the investigation.
They included grief counselors meeting with families who have learned
that treasured urns contained only concrete dust, as well as detectives
scouring the grounds and neighboring properties for more evidence.</TE>
<TE>   Some of the remains will never be identified, Sperry said. "It's not
like a plane crash where . . . you know the names of each one" of the
victims, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Even determining the sheer number of bodies that were left to rot
outside the crematory is "an enormous problem," Sperry said, because of
the helter-skelter way bones seem to have been discarded. "It's like
taking 100 jigsaw puzzle pieces, and pouring them on the ground upside
down," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Confounding the investigation, investigators said, is that the
crematory has no records before last October. The business, which
apparently had no outside employees, was not licensed by the state.
Former coroner Bill McGill filed a complaint in 1995 to state officials.
Nothing came of it, McGill said Monday.</TE>
<TE>   The crematory's troubles seemed to touch virtually everyone living in
northern Georgia's Walker County.</TE>
<TE>   Retired dairyman Willie Haslerig, 80, considers himself a good family
friend. Just a couple of weeks ago--before all of this--he had stopped by
the home to check on the elder Marsh. "They're a nice bunch of working
people," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Of the son: "He's a young fellow, quiet, but he was on his way up in
the world. I respected him a whole lot, and I figured he was a clean
businessman until this thing exploded. And now I'm caught up in the
middle of this," Haslerig said. "My sister was cremated by him two years
ago, and now hers might be one of the bodies."</TE>
<TE>   Roger Neal, who serves with the younger Marsh on the board overseeing
family and children's services for the county, said that all outward
appearances suggested that the crematory was operating without problems.</TE>
<TE>   "I'd be with him at least once a month, and everything seemed all
right," Neal said. "He had good vehicles, dressed well. Things were going
pretty good, apparently.</TE>
<TE>   "So we're all stunned," Neal said. "We're having a hard time dealing
with this."</TE>
<TE>   McGill, who served as county coroner from 1977 to 2000, said despite
his complaint he had no reason to suspect the crematory wasn't going
about its business. He had visited the facility once, about 10 years ago.</TE>
<TE>   McGill said he wasn't surprised that neighbors apparently detected no
foul odors from the property. Most of the remains were underground,
inside sealed vaults or inside the closed metal storage shed, and "you
won't get much odor until you disturb them," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The incinerators used by crematories cost upward of $30,000, said Jack
Springer, spokesman for the Cremation Assn. of North America.</TE>
<TE>   Tri-State Crematory, he said, is not among its 1,200 members.</TE>
<TE>   "There are lots of people who can fix incinerators," he said. "If [the
Marshes' incinerator] wasn't working, why did [Brent Marsh] accept
bodies? I can't believe that, for all these years, the funeral homes that
were sending him bodies didn't, at an unannounced time, check out his
operation."</TE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>PURACE, Colombia
</DL>
<LD>When the guerrillas came to destroy this little town, Jhimmy Guauna
was there to stop them.</LD>
<LD>   The musician and member of an indigenous band left his simple
whitewashed home with weapon in hand: his flute. Soon, nearly everyone in
town had joined him in the main square. They chanted. They sang. They
waved white flags and told the guerrillas to leave.</LD>
<LD>   The New Year's Eve uprising did not succeed. When the rebels left a
few hours later, several buildings were in ruins. Two police officers had
been killed. And Guauna was dead.</LD>
<TE>   Medical workers said a single bullet had passed through his throat,
silencing the singer, painter and aspiring lawyer. Whether stray round or
deliberate shot, the townspeople got the message: Next time, let the
guerrillas win.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm going to stay inside" if the guerrillas return, said Guauna's
brother Diego, who lived with Jhimmy in this town that clings like a
wasp's nest to a cliff ledge high in the western Andes. "It'd be tough to
confront them."</TE>
<TE>   Jhimmy Guauna was not the first civilian killed in Colombia's
guerrilla war, nor the most recent. As Colombia's 38-year-old conflict
has intensified in the past few years, it has become one of the deadliest
in the world for noncombatants.</TE>
<TE>   The number of civilians killed each year by one of Colombia's
bewildering array of armed groups has skyrocketed, from 1,552 dead in
1998 to an estimated 5,400 in 2001.</TE>
<TE>   For every soldier killed in combat, six civilians die, either from
cross-fire, assassinations or massacres carried out by the military,
leftist guerrillas or right-wing paramilitary groups, according to
figures kept by the Center for Investigation and Popular Education, a
research group based in Bogota, the capital.</TE>
<TE>   Colombia, in fact, is one of the few war zones in the world where all
illegal armed groups at times explicitly target civilians, according to
human rights activists. In Colombia's drug-financed conflict, civilians
often become targets as armed groups try to exert control over rural
areas where coca, the plant used in making cocaine, is grown. Farmers,
housewives, store owners and teachers are shot, blown up or hacked to
death. The murders take place day and night, in cities and towns, at home
and in schools and churches.</TE>
<TE>   It's a crisis the Colombian government has so far failed to end. Peace
talks begun three years ago have made little progress, nearly collapsing
earlier this year. Hundreds of towns and hamlets are without police or
soldiers because of lack of money or fears for the officers' safety,
leaving citizens vulnerable to the whims of local rebel or paramilitary
commanders. Even when towns do have protection, it's usually provided by
poorly equipped police facing battle-hardened fighters.</TE>
<TE>   In response, an extraordinary grass-roots resistance has flourished in
the last several years.</TE>
<TE>   Towns have declared themselves peace islands, where neither the army
nor insurgents are welcome. Other communities have mounted ad hoc
displays of resistance. Still others have attempted to directly negotiate
with the armed groups.</TE>
<TE>   So far, there have been few successes, although some civilians
continue to hold out hope.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a long, slow process and there's no magic bullet," said Robin
Kirk, an expert on Colombia with New York-based Human Rights Watch.</TE>
<TE>   What is clear is that none of the armed groups will allow any such
movements to threaten their power.</TE>
<TE>   Comandante Vladimir is the nom de guerre for a member of the
Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC, which attacked Purace on
Dec. 31. Standing at a rainy, wind-swept roadblock in Colombia's high
plains 12 miles from the village, he explained that the civilian
resistance was a "serious" issue that the guerrillas would soon clear up.</TE>
<TE>   "We are going to make people understand things," said Vladimir, a
17-year-old who has been a rebel for four years. "We are going to call
everyone who has been doing this civil resistance together to explain to
them what is happening. The government is putting the people against us.</TE>
<TE>   "The people are confused," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Two leftist rebel groups have fought the government through most of
the nearly four decades of conflict. More recently, right-wing
paramilitary groups have joined the battle, sometimes with support from
the army.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike other conflicts in which private armies must depend on locals
for food, shelter or supplies, none of Colombia's armed groups need the
goodwill of civilians.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, all sides finance their activities at least in part from
drugs. Colombia accounts for nearly 80% of the world's supply of cocaine
and most of the heroin sold on the East Coast of the United States.</TE>
<TE>   The Colombian military estimates that more than $500 million a year
from drugs and kidnappings flows to the country's leftist rebel
groups--FARC and the smaller National Liberation Army, or ELN. The groups
tax farmers who grow coca, and the Colombian military says FARC has also
begun to process and transport illegal drugs.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, paramilitary leader Carlos Castano has said that as much as
70% of the income for his right-wing United Self-Defense Forces of
Colombia comes from drug sources as well, financing its explosive growth
from a few hundred men in the 1980s to more than 10,000 today.</TE>
<TE>   More than any other factor, this growing reliance on drug money has
thrust civilians onto Colombia's killing fields as each group grapples
for territory. In addition, the desire to control transit corridors and
natural resources fuels the land grab.</TE>
<TE>   The farmers and merchants living in areas controlled by paramilitary
forces are seen by guerrilla groups as right-wing sympathizers, supplying
labor and money to the enemy. Civilians in rebel-controlled territory are
viewed with suspicion by the rightists.</TE>
<TE>   That is why a sense of dread gripped the town of San Vicente del
Caguan last month, when it seemed that peace talks between rebels and the
government were on the verge of collapse.</TE>
<TE>   The town is the capital of a special zone ceded to guerrillas by the
government for negotiations. Residents feared that the military would
roll into the region to regain control if the talks ended, to be followed
by paramilitary forces.</TE>
<TE>   "If the zone goes, we are cannon fodder," said Victor Ayala, the
second in command of the unarmed local police force.</TE>
<TE>   The self-sufficiency provided by drug money has also meant that the
paramilitary groups and guerrillas don't have to answer to outside
forces. There are no superpowers that can yank their funding, no external
groups to influence their thinking. Both easily ignore repeated pleas
from the United Nations and national and international peace groups to
show more respect for human rights.</TE>
<TE>   As a result, Colombia's conflict is more a brutal clash for power than
an effort to win the hearts and minds of the populace.</TE>
<TE>   "As the sides fight for territory and economic resources, each year
the conflict becomes more degraded," said Ana Teresa Bernal, head of
Redepaz, a leading Colombian peace group. "It's a conflict that more than
anything else affects the civilian population. It is tearing apart the
fabric of society."</TE>
<TE>   The first, scattered attempts at organized civilian resistance came in
the 1980s, when the right-wing paramilitary groups began to flourish. But
it wasn't until the late 1990s that local peace groups began a concerted
effort to advance the cause of civil resistance, especially in rural
areas.</TE>
<TE>   The first "communities of peace" arose in northern Colombia, in a
volatile and isolated region near the border with Panama. People from
several towns banded together and pledged to remain strictly neutral in
the conflict, following three simple rules: no guns, no participation in
the war and no sharing of information with any side.</TE>
<TE>   The hope was that the paramilitary forces and guerrillas battling for
control of the region's transit routes to the Pacific and Atlantic would
leave the communities alone.</TE>
<TE>   But the theory was complicated by the realities of life. Families had
children who belonged to guerrilla units. Paramilitary fighters would
visit girlfriends in the towns.</TE>
<TE>   And so, both sides continued targeting civilians.</TE>
<TE>   By some estimates, more than 100 people have been killed in the peace
communities since 1997. Those who have worked to foster the growing
number of peace communities insist that many more people would have been
killed if not for the towns' desire to remain neutral. But they
acknowledge that results could have been better.</TE>
<TE>   "The idea was that the armed groups would respect the communities.
That never happened," said one researcher, who declined to be named
because she is still involved in the project.</TE>
<TE>   Jhimmy Guauna's rebellion here in Purace was one recent example of a
spontaneous grass-roots backlash. Several other towns throughout Colombia
have held similar demonstrations.</TE>
<TE>   Many of them have taken place in indigenous communities, where there
is a long history of social organization as groups have fought for
recognition by the government. Still, the protests seem mostly a rush of
adrenaline and frustration, quickly quashed by the reality of confronting
armed guerrillas.</TE>
<TE>   For instance, in Coconuco, about 10 miles south of Purace, a squad of
ELN guerrillas attacked the police station Dec. 17, firing machine guns
for less than an hour, then retreating. No one was injured.</TE>
<TE>   As the guerrillas were leaving town, they ran into a band of carolers
celebrating the Christmas holidays. The revelers shouted at the
guerrillas and were joined by other townspeople.</TE>
<TE>   Local media portrayed the event as though the citizens had driven out
the guerrillas.</TE>
<TE>   When the ELN and FARC guerrillas came back two weeks later, striking
the police stations in Purace and Coconuco in a coordinated attack, there
was no effort to take to the streets.</TE>
<TE>   "The first display was a valiant act, a defense of the country, the
people, the land," said Gustavo Valencia, Coconuco's mayor. "But in front
of the power of guns, we are vulnerable. People are terrified now."</TE>
<TE>   The tiny coffee town of Tarso in western Colombia is yet another
experiment in civilian resistance. Three years ago, ex-guerrillas got
together with local residents and held meetings that led to the creation
of a municipal assembly with 150 representatives.</TE>
<TE>   The idea was that widespread citizen participation would stave off
attacks by convincing the leftist rebels that the town was run by the
people, not Bogota's central government.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, the assembly worked with the mayor to develop a plan to
provide night classes for poor farmers, free bus transportation for
students and a fund to support small businesses.</TE>
<TE>   Then, cars and motorcycles without license plates--an effort to
conceal the vehicles' origin--began to appear. Strangers with side arms
were seen idling on street corners with local police officers.</TE>
<TE>   In October, they struck. A squad of right-wing fighters, angered that
ex-guerrillas were involved in the process, approached one of the leaders
of the assembly in front of the white church that dominates the town.
They gave the former ELN member and four friends 24 hours to leave town.</TE>
<TE>   The threat put a halt to the experiment in self-reliance. The assembly
has not met since October. The town seems a broken place, with fragments
of the assembly's vision scattered around like so much shattered glass.</TE>
<TE>   One assembly member, a coffee rancher, said he would consider it a
blessing if the right-wing paramilitary forces told him to leave.</TE>
<TE>   "At least that way, I know they won't kill me," said Gabriel Jaime
Gomez, 40, who was once kidnapped by an ELN band. Rebels who later left
the same group worked with him to forge the assembly.</TE>
<TE>   The former guerrillas who fled are more hopeful. They acknowledge that
many of Colombia's civil resistance movements have only ended in more
deaths.</TE>
<TE>   But Tarso, they hope, will be different.</TE>
<TE>   "The process has collapsed, but it will recuperate," said William
Zapata, one of those threatened by the right-wing fighters. "It cannot be
stopped."</TE>

<HD>Pioneering Newscaster Howard K. Smith Dies</HD>
<DH>Passings: Principles shaped the career of the award-winning Murrow
protege. He was 87.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELAINE WOO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Howard K. Smith, the former CBS and ABC newsman and commentator,
whose daring, analytical reporting from the front lines of World War II
helped launch a golden age in broadcast journalism, has died. He was 87.</LD>
<LD>   Smith died Friday night at his home in Bethesda, Md., his family said
Monday. The cause of the death was pneumonia aggravated by congestive
heart failure.</LD>
<LD>   The broadcaster, who spent 20 years at CBS and 18 years at ABC,
covered nearly every major event of his era, including the assassination
of John F. Kennedy, the Vietnam War, the civil rights movement and the
Watergate scandal.</LD>
<TE>   One of the last of a breed, he was known for uncompromising
journalistic ethics and strong opinions, which eventually destroyed his
relationship with his first network and caused troubles at his last.</TE>
<TE>   "He was a leading light in journalism because he espoused this idea
that journalism was more than just the facts, ma'am," said Daniel Schorr,
the Emmy-winning former CBS correspondent.</TE>
<TE>   "The great value that Howard Smith represented was that journalism . .
. has to instruct and journalism has to inspire. That was not a widely
accepted theory of what journalism was, but he believed in that."</TE>
<TE>One of Elite 'Murrow's Boys'</TE>
<TE>   Smith belonged to an elite band of proteges of Edward R. Murrow, the
legendary CBS newsman. Erudite and adventure-seeking, "Murrow's boys," as
they were known, included the late Eric Sevareid and Charles Collingwood.
Along with a handful of other reporters whose careers Morrow nurtured,
they formed what many critics considered the greatest broadcast news team
in the history of the medium.</TE>
<TE>   Originally a print reporter who moved into radio, Smith covered the
surrender of the German army in 1945 and the Nuremberg war crimes trials.
In succeeding years, the reluctant convert to television moderated the
historic first televised presidential debate, between Kennedy and Richard
M. Nixon, in 1960. A decade later, he had the first one-one-one
television interview with a sitting president after Nixon took office. He
also became the first major broadcaster to demand Nixon's resignation
over Watergate.</TE>
<TE>   The slender, scholarly looking Southerner also was probably the only
journalist who ever lost his job over quoting 18th-century political
theorist Edmund Burke.</TE>
<TE>   "He was a class act. He cared deeply about what he did. It's very hard
to explain that without sounding silly these days," said Marvin Kalb,
another longtime former CBS correspondent.</TE>
<TE>   He was born Howard Kingsbury Smith Jr. in Ferriday, La., of
aristocratic stock. The family wealth was lost at the turn of the
century, so Howard Sr. worked as a railroad conductor. He settled in New
Orleans after marrying a part-Cajun woman named Minnie Cates.</TE>
<TE>   A lackadaisical student through most of high school, Howard Jr.
suddenly awoke to the realities of the Depression during his senior year.
He brought up his grades, became editor of the school paper, and
graduated with a scholarship to Tulane University.</TE>
<TE>   In high school he discovered that he could get paid for writing. So he
majored in journalism, but also studied French and German. After
graduating in 1937, he won a tuition-free summer at Heidelberg University
and worked his way to Germany on a freighter.</TE>
<TE>   His horror at the ardor of German anti-Semitism and invincibility
instilled in him, he later said, "a sense of fright that did not leave me
for many years." He returned to the States briefly for a $15 a week job
at the New Orleans Item. A Rhodes scholarship became his ticket back to
Europe, where, through pluck and luck, he became a foreign correspondent.</TE>
<TE>   While studying at Oxford, he plunged into Labor Party politics,
literally painting the town with protests against the British
government's inaction against the Nazis. He met the chief of United
Press' London bureau, who promised he would hire him if war broke out.</TE>
<TE>   On the day the war began, Smith became a United Press correspondent
and, because of his fluency in German, was soon dispatched to Berlin. He
worked for the New York Times before he was lured away, in 1941, to CBS
Radio.</TE>
<TE>   In Berlin, life for Americans grew increasingly difficult as the
United States began aiding Britain against Hitler. Smith's reports were
shredded by Nazi censors and his typewriters were confiscated. Fearing he
would be jailed, he spent what seemed the longest week of his life trying
to obtain a permit to travel to Switzerland.</TE>
<TE>   When his permit finally was granted, he celebrated so heartily with
colleagues that he delayed his departure a day--to Dec. 7, 1941. By the
time he reached Bern, the U.S. had been attacked by the Japanese at Pearl
Harbor and his colleagues back in Germany had been interned. He was the
last American correspondent to leave Berlin.</TE>
<TE>   Although he was marooned in Switzerland for the next two years because
its borders were closed, he developed extensive contacts in underground
Europe and was the first reporter to describe the activities of Tito, the
leader of the Yugoslav partisans. He also wrote a nonfiction book, aptly
titled "Last Train from Berlin," which became a bestseller in the U.S.
and Britain.</TE>
<TE>   Once the Allied liberation of France began, Smith was able to leave
Switzerland and spent the remainder of the war at the front lines. He
covered the Battle of the Bulge, witnessed the German surrender in Berlin
and, later, the Nuremberg trials.</TE>
<TE>   A muscular writer, he delivered evocative battlefield reports. "On the
roadside lie skeletons of streamlined gray Wehrmacht cars which careened
to conquest over every highway in Europe," he said in a broadcast on
reentering Germany in late 1944. "Now they lie, belly to the sky, burned
out and red with rust from the autumn rain. The whole desolate scene is
one of crushed power."</TE>
<TE>   At war's end, Murrow made Smith his successor as CBS' chief European
correspondent and left to become vice president of CBS News in New York.</TE>
<TE>   Over the next few years, Smith made the transition to television. He
and the other Murrow acolytes became heroes to the new generation of
broadcast journalists.</TE>
<TE>   With values forged at the front lines of World War II, the Murrow team
shared their mentor's belief that broadcast news played an essential role
in a democracy and should inform citizens of government's failures as
well as its successes.</TE>
<TE>   As a foreign correspondent under Murrow, Smith had relatively free
rein to air his opinions without worrying about ruffling the bosses back
home. But that freewheeling era at CBS was to end.</TE>
<TE>   In 1961, Murrow announced he was leaving the network for a job in the
Kennedy administration. Before departing, he asked Smith, by then chief
Washington correspondent, to take over a documentary on racial tension in
Birmingham.</TE>
<TE>   In the city that Martin Luther King Jr. had called the most segregated
in the U.S., Smith witnessed the ferocious beating of a busload of
Freedom Riders by a band of Ku Klux Klan members. As if on cue, the
Birmingham police arrived as soon as the mob dispersed.</TE>
<TE>   Smith felt he had seen something out of Nazi Germany. He took three
bleeding black youths back to his motel and interviewed them,
broadcasting every hour for the rest of the afternoon. One of his
eyewitness reports was reprinted verbatim on the front page of the New
York Times. He had been the only national reporter on the scene.</TE>
<TE>   The unfavorable attention his coverage brought to Birmingham led to
death threats and mysterious technical problems that blocked further
transmission of his stories. The CBS affiliate there severed its
relationship with the network.</TE>
<TE>   Undaunted, Smith returned to New York to write a stinging Sunday radio
commentary blaming the Klan and Bull Connor, Birmingham's police chief,
for the violence.</TE>
<TE>   Wanting to conclude the TV documentary with a similar message, he
chose this line from Burke, the 18th-century British parliamentarian:
"The only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good men to do
nothing."</TE>
<TE>   CBS brass opposed the quote as flagrant editorializing and ordered
Smith to cut it. When "Who Speaks for Birmingham?" was aired, the line
was gone.</TE>
<TE>   News of CBS' suppression of Smith made the New York Times. The
criticism so infuriated CBS founder William S. Paley that he summoned
Smith to his office for a fateful meeting.</TE>
<TE>   Smith insisted on his right to air his opinions. Paley insisted that
he, not his employees, had final say on the network's editorial
positions. The CBS chief then pulled out a memo Smith had written on the
dispute, hurled it on the table and denounced it as "junk."</TE>
<TE>   "If that is what you believe, you had better go somewhere else," Paley
said, according to Smith.</TE>
<TE>   Others gave different accounts of why Smith was fired. Richard Salant,
who headed CBS News through the 1960s, said the final confrontation was
over Smith's unwavering on-air assault on a Senate proposal to raise the
ceiling on the national debt.</TE>
<TE>   In the year following Smith's dismissal, the civil rights movement
gained momentum. Smith noticed that other CBS correspondents were using
the Burke quote without interference from network brass. It had become a
fair comment.</TE>
<TE>   "I remembered the old adage that it is smart to be right, but it is
stupid to be right at the wrong time," Smith wryly noted.</TE>
<TE>Gets His Own Program at ABC</TE>
<TE>   His firing was viewed by some as a watershed in the history of CBS
News. "[A] great fissure seemed to open under the feet of the
correspondents who remained," Stanley Cloud and Lynne Olson wrote in
their 1996 book, "The Murrow Boys: Pioneers on the Front Lines of
Broadcast Journalism." The freewheeling Murrow era was over.</TE>
<TE>   Then an offer came from Nationwide Insurance Co. to sponsor him on a
news and commentary program. He took the proposal to ABC, which hired him
and included a clause in his contract promising that the network and the
sponsor would not infringe on his "independence of mind and spirit."</TE>
<TE>   The show, which debuted on Feb. 14, 1962, was called "Howard K.
Smith--News and Comment." Newsweek soon was calling it "the most
stimulating news show on television."</TE>
<TE>   Smith ranged far and wide for topics. He analyzed the progress of the
Kennedy administration. He interviewed Brigitte Bardot, Malcolm X and
Jimmy Hoffa.</TE>
<TE>   Then came his piece on Nixon's 1962 defeat in the race for governor of
California that had ended on Nixon's lament about the press not having
him to "kick around" anymore.</TE>
<TE>   Smith chose to include in "The Political Obituary of Richard M. Nixon"
an interview with Alger Hiss, the alleged Soviet agent whom Nixon, as a
young congressman, had investigated in the 1940s.</TE>
<TE>   The interview brought tens of thousands of protest calls and letters
from viewers sympathetic to Nixon who thought Smith guilty of kicking a
man when he was down. Sponsors threatened to cancel their support of
other ABC shows.</TE>
<TE>   An unrepentant Smith said he "would use a prostitute on the program,
if she had an important role in history."</TE>
<TE>   Eight months later, Smith's sponsor quietly withdrew from his show and
ABC canceled it.</TE>
<TE>   After a few years of uncertainty, Smith's career took off again. In
1969, he was made co-anchor of the evening news with Frank Reynolds.
ABC's ratings rose. Smith later was teamed with the easygoing Harry
Reasoner, and their ratings zoomed to No. 1 in some major markets.</TE>
<TE>   He remained in the anchor chair until 1975, when his role was reduced
to commentary. When Roone Arledge took over as head of ABC News in 1978,
he dumped Smith's commentaries entirely.</TE>
<TE>   A disgusted Smith pinned a terse resignation letter on the bulletin
board several months later. At 65, he ended his broadcasting career.</TE>
<TE>   Smith won many honors, including an Emmy and a Peabody. He also earned
six Overseas Press Club awards.</TE>
<TE>   Smith is survived by his wife of 60 years, Bennie; a son, Jack, of San
Francisco; a daughter, Catherine, of Los Angeles; and three
grandchildren.</TE>

<HD>Russia to Retire Volatile Torpedo Model Used on Kursk</HD>
<DH>Military: The weapons detonated on board. Inspector says collision
didn't cause sub to sink.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBYN DIXON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>MOSCOW
</DL>
<LD>The Russian navy said Monday that it is scrapping the type of
torpedo used on board the doomed nuclear submarine Kursk, which sank in
August 2000 after two explosions.</LD>
<LD>   A four-month forensic examination of the submarine exposed shoddy
practices in the Russian navy and disproved claims by naval officials
that a foreign submarine collided with the Kursk, triggering the tragedy,
Russian Prosecutor General Vladimir Ustinov said at a news conference.</LD>
<LD>   The Kursk sank during exercises in the Barents Sea, taking the lives
of all 118 crew members. An initial explosion led to a catastrophic blast
when other torpedoes detonated, but the submarine's warheads and reactors
were unaffected.</LD>
<TE>   Ustinov said Monday that he was convinced that there was no collision.
Five vessels were in the vicinity of the sub, he said, but none was
dangerously close.</TE>
<TE>   But the commander of the Russian navy, Adm. Vladimir Kuroyedov, said a
separate government commission investigating the disaster is still
considering three possible causes: a torpedo explosion, a collision with
a foreign submarine and a brush with a World War II mine.</TE>
<TE>   Kuroyedov did acknowledge that the sub's torpedoes, propelled by
volatile hydrogen peroxide, were unreliable. Other countries abandoned
them after a 1955 explosion on the British submarine Sidon, he said; the
Soviet Union began using them in 1957.</TE>
<TE>   On Monday, Kuroyedov shifted responsibility for the torpedo's
shortcomings to "scientists and designers," saying the hydrogen
peroxide's "contact with certain metals may cause unpredictable
consequences."</TE>
<TE>   "The torpedoes have already been removed from submarines," Kuroyedov
said grimly. "Now we are considering a replacement."</TE>
<TE>   Ustinov led the forensic examination of the Kursk, which was raised
and towed to port in a delicate operation last fall.</TE>
<TE>   For years, Ustinov said, naval rules were breached aboard the Kursk. A
system to send out an emergency beacon was regularly turned off, and the
sub's emergency buoy, designed to mark the craft's position in case of an
accident, was out of order.</TE>
<TE>   Investigators inspected 10 submarine logs, data recorders in the
command post and three notes left by crew members trapped in the Kursk,
but Ustinov said none explained the cause of the first explosion. He said
he hoped that the raising of the bow section, scheduled for this spring,
would cast light on the cause of the disaster.</TE>
<TE>   The decision to scrap the torpedo was immediately controversial.
Eduard Baltin, a retired Black Sea Fleet commander, said in a phone
interview that the move was premature.</TE>
<TE>   "They still don't know why it exploded, and that is the main thing.
Adm. Kuroyedov demonstrates his total incompetence by making such a
stupid decision. People die in cars every day, but no one tries to ban
cars," he said.</TE>
<TE>   But retired Rear Adm. Georgy Kostev, former deputy commander of a
Northern Fleet nuclear submarine division, said in a phone interview that
the decision should have been made years ago.</TE>
<TE>   "These torpedoes have always been a big headache for submariners
because they had hydrogen peroxide in their fuel, which is very leaky and
can easily cause a fire on board."</TE>

<HD>Mediators Seek Truce Between Afghan Tribes</HD>
<DH>Clash: Weekend fighting killed eight near Mazar- i-Sharif, in
biggest rift yet in the Northern Alliance.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>TASHQURGHAN, Afghanistan
</DL>
<LD>Mediators shuttled between Uzbek and Tajik commanders Monday trying
to hammer out a truce after a factional clash killed eight people and
wounded 30 in this northern Afghan town.</LD>
<LD>   The fighting poked a hole in the paper-thin sense of peace here and
raised tensions between the region's most powerful warlords, the same
ones who had fought together as members of the Northern Alliance.</LD>
<LD>   "When we had to face one enemy, we did fine," said Gholam Sakhi
Mourtazar, a police commissioner and one of the mediators. "But now the
bigger groups want all the power and the rest of us to disappear. It's
like the old days."</LD>
<TE>   Ata Mohammed, the leading Tajik warlord, dismissed such talk with the
wave of a hand.</TE>
<TE>   "What we had was just a little problem between local leaders, nothing
bigger," he said.</TE>
<TE>   It's not clear what sparked the fighting, which took place Saturday
and Sunday 25 miles east of Mazar-i-Sharif. Some said it was the
defection of commanders from one warlord to another. Others blamed
tensions over disarmament.</TE>
<TE>   Another explanation centered on a local commander who allegedly stole
sheep and shot a dog.</TE>
<TE>   Whatever the cause, the Tashqurghan melee marked the deepest fissure
yet within the Northern Alliance, the U.S.-backed coalition that launched
the rout of the Taliban regime last fall. There have been sporadic
battles in other areas of Afghanistan since the Taliban collapsed. But
not until last weekend have large numbers of alliance troops unleashed
their considerable firepower on one another.</TE>
<TE>   Shells sailed over the town's market, machine-gun fire ripped through
stalls selling raisins, spices, saddles and cloth, and a local employee
of an aid organization was killed by a stray bullet.</TE>
<TE>   Witnesses said U.S. Special Forces soldiers who have been providing
protection for leaders of three main alliance factions were nearly caught
in the cross-fire.</TE>
<TE>   Several U.S. soldiers interviewed in Mazar-i-Sharif said they weren't
allowed to talk about the incident.</TE>
<TE>   The clash came at a time when a new police force in Mazar-i-Sharif has
been trying to trim the number of armed men on the streets and install a
sense of order. Weapons checks at city limits have helped. But hundreds
of gunmen still stroll around the city, and there's a growing
disillusionment with the interim government in Kabul.</TE>
<TE>   Different factions tell different stories about the trouble in
Tashqurghan, a town on the edge of a steppe where farmers shop for
supplies and nomads bring their camels for water.</TE>
<TE>   According to Tajik leaders, Uzbek troops attacked their positions
after three commanders from the Uzbek-led Jambish party defected to the
Tajik-led Jamiat party. Northern Afghanistan is dominated by three ethnic
groups--Tajiks, Uzbeks and Hazaras--and each has a political party and a
militia. Towns often are divided among the groups' militias.</TE>
<TE>   Uzbek authorities said the fighting was the fault of a local commander
who resisted efforts to keep armed men out of population centers. That
commander, named Kabir, seemed to have disappeared, and none of the Uzbek
authorities knew where to find him.</TE>
<TE>   Hazara leaders, who historically have enjoyed a modicum of neutrality,
said the Tajiks were trying to consolidate power across northern
Afghanistan by bribing commanders to join their side.</TE>
<TE>   Zainullah, one of the commanders who defected to the Tajiks, said he
was not pressured to switch.</TE>
<TE>   "My Jambish leader was a sheep thief," he said. "It was a dishonor to
be with him."</TE>
<TE>   He added that his leader had stolen many things from Tashqurghan
residents and even shot his own dog as he was leaving town.</TE>
<TE>   For the last week, tensions had been rising here, locals said, as
Tajik and Uzbek forces began to wheel heavy weaponry into town, including
Soviet-made missile batteries. On Saturday, Gen. Abdul Rashid Dostum, the
leading warlord in the north and an ethnic Uzbek, dispatched an emissary
to negotiate with the Tajik troops.</TE>
<TE>   The talks went nowhere, and, as Dostum's emissary was driving off,
gunfire erupted.</TE>
<TE>   The battle ended Sunday afternoon when the more numerous Tajiks
surrounded the Uzbek garrison, forcing the Uzbeks to flee.</TE>
<TE>   On Monday, mediator Mourtazar, a Hazara, met with Uzbek leaders and
tried to persuade them not to send new troops to Tashqurghan.</TE>
<TE>   "All the people here want is quiet," he said. "Is that too much?"</TE>

<HD>Pakistani Police Defuse Rockets Aimed at Airport</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>KARACHI, Pakistan
</DL>
<LD>A police bomb squad defused four rockets Monday that were aimed at
an airport in Karachi used by the U.S.-led military coalition operating
in Afghanistan.</LD>
<LD>   Officials said they believed that Islamic radicals were responsible.
They said it appeared that the rockets--rigged with a homemade timer--and
the Jan. 23 kidnapping of Wall Street Journal reporter Daniel Pearl were
part of an extremist campaign against President Pervez Musharraf because
of his support for the U.S.-led war against terrorism.</LD>
<LD>   Two of the rockets were aimed at a terminal at Karachi's international
airport used by the coalition for supplying troops in Afghanistan. The
other two were aimed at an airport hotel used as a barracks for troops
assigned to the airport.</LD>
<TE>   The rockets were spotted by a passerby, who alerted police.</TE>
<TE>   "It's obvious who did it," police Supt. Asad Khan said. "It is the
extremists we are cracking down on."</TE>
<TE>   Police Chief Kamal Shah said the 107-millimeter rockets, found about
half a mile from the terminal, would probably not have caused serious
damage but were meant as a warning to the government about its support
for the U.S.-led campaign.</TE>
<TE>   "It was not possible to hit a target," Shah said. "It was more 'to
whom it may concern,' because we have come down very hard with
extremists."</TE>
<TE>   Concern about Islamic militant activity in Karachi has risen since the
abduction of Pearl, who was investigating links between Pakistani
militants and Richard C. Reid, the man arrested in December on a flight
from Paris to Miami with explosives in his shoes. Pearl's whereabouts
remain unknown.</TE>
<TE>   Police have four men in custody in the Pearl case, including Ahmed
Omar Saeed Sheikh, a British-born Islamic militant who is believed to be
the ringleader.</TE>
<TE>   Saeed admitted his role in the kidnapping during a court hearing
Thursday and complained that Pakistan "shouldn't be catering to America's
needs."</TE>
<TE>   With Saeed in custody, the focus of the nationwide manhunt is Haider
Ali Farooqi, believed to be Saeed's accomplice and the actual kidnapper.</TE>
<TE>   In a report Monday, the English-language newspaper the News reported
that Saeed told interrogators Pearl's kidnapping was the "first salvo" in
an all-out battle between Islamic militants and the government.</TE>

<HD>Jungle's Odd Couple Put Teeth in Slumping Kenyan Tourism</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVAN MAHARAJ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NAIROBI, Kenya
</DL>
<LD>Forget the burning question of who will succeed President Daniel
Arap Moi when he retires this year after nearly a quarter of a century in
office.</LD>
<LD>   Or why crime continues to ravage this East African city.</LD>
<LD>   Instead, many Kenyans are trying to unravel the bizarre saga of a
lioness that has apparently defied the laws of the jungle by adopting two
baby oryxes in the past six weeks.</LD>
<TE>   Explanations have been pouring in fast and furiously. The lioness,
some scientists say, is apparently maternally deprived. Unable to have
offspring or suffering from the loss of a cub, she has decided to adopt
an animal--even one that she would normally crunch for lunch.</TE>
<TE>   Others in this majority Christian country see a lion walking side by
side with a baby oryx as the fulfillment of biblical prophecy. Isaiah
11:6, they proudly note, prophesies that the calf and young lion will
dwell together.</TE>
<TE>   And this week, another theory has begun to take hold: The lion was
given the second oryx by people who wanted to boost tourism and lure
visitors to the Samburu National Reserve in northern Kenya.</TE>
<TE>   "It is most unusual for a lion to exhibit this kind of behavior
twice," said Daphne Sheldrick, a wildlife expert who runs an orphanage
for elephants, rhinos and other animals here. "This is Kenya. The level
of corruption is high. It's not beyond the realm of possibilities that
this is being stage-managed."</TE>
<TE>   Whatever the explanation, the strange friendship between predator and
prey continues to preoccupy Kenyans--and many others around the globe.</TE>
<TE>   Daniel Njaga, a spokesman for the Kenya Wildlife Service, said he has
received numerous calls from reporters in the United States, Europe and
Africa inquiring about the unusual companions.</TE>
<TE>   Game wardens decided that the lioness' latest relationship was not in
the best interests of the newborn and took the oryx away over the weekend
when the lioness left it to go hunting.</TE>
<TE>   The oryx, about a week old and frail from starvation, seemed to "have
the will to pull through this," said Sara Spendrup, a spokeswoman with
the Lewa Downs private game sanctuary, where the oryx was being nursed
with cow's milk. The calf was to be transferred today to an animal
orphanage in Nairobi, the capital.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the Daily Nation newspaper reported that the lioness "could
be set for a third wonder," as she had been seen trailing another herd of
oryx. "We expect to see it guarding another baby from the herd," the
paper quoted an unidentified game official as saying.</TE>
<TE>   Lodges in the area, which had been hit by a slump in tourism, have
since reported brisk business, with tourists and nature experts flocking
to Samburu to catch a glimpse of the lioness with the mysterious maternal
instincts.</TE>
<TE>   No one suggested that a conspiracy was afoot when the lion was first
seen last month traipsing around Samburu with a baby oryx. That
relationship lasted 15 days before a male lion snatched the oryx from the
lioness and devoured it.</TE>
<TE>   Ditte Dahl Lisbjerg, an employee with the United Nations Educational,
Scientific and Cultural Organization here who specializes in animal
behavior, suggested that a confluence of events was probably responsible
for the odd couple. Before its hunting instincts can come into play, a
predator needs its prey to flee. The oryx probably didn't--hence the
lioness' lack of ferocity.</TE>
<TE>   The oryx, whose species lives in herds of up to 200, may simply have
been behaving according to its herd instinct, trailing behind the only
animal in the vicinity left to follow--the lioness.</TE>
<TE>   For Lisbjerg and others, news that the same lioness had befriended
another oryx--and on Valentine's Day--sounded too good to be true.</TE>
<TE>   "It's highly unlikely that this could happen a second time," she said.
"I would have to see that to believe it. If someone didn't give her [the]
second oryx, then I'd say that this is a lioness with a psychological
disorder."</TE>
<TE>   Njaga, the Kenya wildlife spokesman, said it was a possibility that
someone might have "introduced the second oryx to the lioness because of
the economic advantage publicity of such an event generates."</TE>
<TE>   "We hope that people do not intervene in this way and that they let
nature take its course," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Even after game wardens seized the second oryx so it wouldn't suffer
the fate of the first, tourists, wildlife experts and looky-loos have
continued to flock to Samburu to see if the lioness will adopt a third
oryx.</TE>
<TE>   "We're very busy today, and tomorrow we have a full house. All 62
rooms are taken," said Herman Mwasaghua, manager of the Serena Samburu
Lodge. His competitors also reported booming business.</TE>
<TE>   Mwasaghua denied that the event with the oryx and lioness was
choreographed.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a lioness with an affinity for oryxes," he said. "It's just a
unique, special lioness."</TE>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>JERUSALEM
</DL>
<LD>Palestinian militants staged a series of attacks Monday, leaving
seven people dead as Palestinian Authority President Yasser Arafat
praised a tentative proposal in which the Arab world would make peace
with Israel in exchange for a total pullout from the West Bank, Gaza
Strip and East Jerusalem.</LD>
<LD>   Israeli warplanes later responded by striking Palestinian security
buildings in the Gaza city of Rafah, witnesses said. A Palestinian police
building in the West Bank town of Ramallah was also hit, the Israeli
military said. There were no immediate reports of casualties.</LD>
<LD>   In the earlier violence, two armed Palestinians tried to infiltrate a
Jewish settlement in Gaza and soldiers opened fire on them, the military
said. Palestinians said one of the gunmen was killed.</LD>
<TE>   The Israeli military said Palestinians also opened fire on an Israeli
vehicle near Gaza's Kissufim crossing into Israel and that a suicide
bomber then blew himself up. Israeli officials said three Israelis and
the bomber were killed and four people were wounded.</TE>
<TE>   The Al Aqsa Martyrs Brigade, a militia linked to Arafat's Fatah
movement, took responsibility for the attack on the vehicle and
identified the attacker as Mohammed Kasser, 22, of Gaza City.</TE>
<TE>   An Israeli policeman was killed and another was injured when a man
activated a car bomb, blowing himself up, on the highway between
Jerusalem and the West Bank's Jordan Valley.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Arafat praised an idea reportedly being considered by Saudi
Arabian Crown Prince Abdullah to offer Israel peace with the Arab world
in exchange for an Israeli pullout from all the territory it occupied in
the 1967 Middle East War.</TE>
<TE>   In a statement, Arafat said the "important positions" presented by
Abdullah represent support for the peace efforts toward creation of a
Palestinian state in the territories, while giving "security for the
state of Israel."</TE>

<LD>England's "metric martyrs," five grocers who were hauled before a

<LD>   Two High Court judges ruled that the men do not have the right to sell
exclusively in pounds and ounces. Lawyers for the five had argued that
England and Wales should be exempt from European Union rules requiring
fruit and vegetables to be labeled in grams and kilograms.</LD>
<LD>   But the judges said EU law ruled supreme. "Imperial measures, much
loved of many, seem to face extinction," Judge Peter Laws said.</LD>

<HD>Strongman's Revival May Derail Slovakia NATO Bid</HD>
<DH>Europe: Former Prime Minister Vladimir Meciar is poised for a
comeback. Western governments strongly oppose him.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID HOLLEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>BRATISLAVA, Slovakia
</DL>
<LD>When the coalition that runs Slovakia won power nearly four years
ago, it was united by one thing: opposition to Vladimir Meciar, then the
much-hated and much-loved prime minister.</LD>
<LD>   The current government has vastly improved Slovakia's relations with
the United States and the European Union, which were badly strained in
the mid-1990s by Meciar's heavy-handed rule.</LD>
<LD>   But now Meciar is on the comeback trail, while Prime Minister Mikulas
Dzurinda's coalition--which embraces parties ranging from the former
Communists to fervent conservatives--faces the possibility of electoral
defeat this year.</LD>
<TE>   With Meciar's profile rising but Western governments still bitterly
opposed to him, Slovakia's early integration into European
institutions--and the growth in regional stability that would
imply--hangs in the balance. Several key diplomats have all but declared
that an invitation for this nation to join NATO, expected in November,
would be dropped if Meciar returned to power in September elections.</TE>
<TE>   Slovakia, formed out of the 1993 breakup of Czechoslovakia, was
refused entry into the North Atlantic Treaty Organization in 1999 during
the alliance's first round of expansion to former Communist countries.
The decision was largely based on the judgment that the nation under
Meciar had not been sufficiently democratic.</TE>
<TE>   "People in Slovakia need to go into the elections with their eyes wide
open," NATO Secretary-General George Robertson said here in November.</TE>
<TE>   Though he declined to tie his remarks to Meciar--"I refuse to
interfere with the domestic politics of this or any other country looking
to membership in NATO"--few observers had any doubt what Robertson was
talking about.</TE>
<TE>   "NATO has bound itself to respect democratic values, ethnic tolerance,
good relations with neighbors as well as a system of independent
judiciary and a free economy," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Meciar, whose political star dimmed two years ago with a failed bid to
win Slovakia's presidency, once again projects confidence.</TE>
<TE>   "We are the sole stabilizing element in Slovakia, with permanent
support of one-third of the population," he said in a recent interview,
citing polls that show his Movement for a Democratic Slovakia to be the
most popular party in a fragmented political scene.</TE>
<TE>   Deputy Prime Minister Maria Kadlecikova, who is in charge of European
integration for Slovakia, acknowledged the urgency of the political
challenge facing the government, with unemployment at 20% and the ruling
parties often fighting among themselves.</TE>
<TE>   "For this present coalition government it is time to stop criticizing
each other and to start with cooperation," she said.</TE>
<TE>   In a poll last month by the Institute for Investigation of Public
Opinion, 33% of respondents supported Meciar's party. SMER, a new
populist party headed by Robert Fico, placed second at 13%, and the
multiparty governing coalition drew just 7%.</TE>
<TE>   Fico and Meciar are competing for the support of disaffected citizens.</TE>
<TE>   "I understand that Western countries are happy with this government,"
Fico said in an interview, "but people in Slovakia are not happy with
this government, because it's not enough only to privatize. It's not
enough only to introduce liberal ideas. Slovakia is not prepared for
liberalism, not at all. Slovakia still needs quite strong government and
quite a strong state."</TE>
<TE>   Many observers think that a three-way election split will put Fico in
position to tilt power one way or the other, or perhaps win the prime
minister's office for himself.</TE>
<TE>   "Mr. Fico will decide about the developments in Slovakia" by throwing
his support to Meciar or the ruling coalition, Kadlecikova predicted. He
is "pro-European and pro-NATO," the deputy prime minister said.</TE>
<TE>   Fico said he would be open to a coalition with Meciar's party, but not
with Meciar himself.</TE>
<TE>   "People are tired," Fico said. "People don't want to follow old faces.
Both the government of Mr. Meciar and the government of Mr. Dzurinda have
not been able first of all to guarantee that there is rule of law. . . .
If you have 20% unemployed people, if you have corruption in all fields
of life, if you have problems to protect your rights in the court system,
if there is suspicion that police are involved in organized crime . . .
people evaluate these politicians according to these results."</TE>
<TE>   Along with Slovakia, the front-runners to join NATO are Slovenia and
the three Baltic states of Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia. Bulgaria and
Romania also are seeking entry but are seen as less likely to win
invitations this year.</TE>
<TE>   Most countries in the former Soviet bloc desire NATO membership not
just to ensure their security but also as a badge of acceptance into
Europe, to impress foreign investors and serve as a stepping stone to
joining the European Union.</TE>
<TE>   Meciar, who played a key role in promoting the peaceful division of
Czechoslovakia, has criticized NATO in the past but speaks now as a
strong advocate of joining the alliance.</TE>
<TE>   His supporters view him as a talented leader and a patriot, even as
the father of his country. But critics charge that he ran an
authoritarian political machine based on patronage, corruption and
disrespect for democratic rules.</TE>
<TE>   Meciar also was criticized for granting a blanket amnesty to the
unknown perpetrators of the 1995 kidnapping of Michal Kovac Jr., whose
father was president at the time and a Meciar rival. The younger Kovac
was taken to Austria in a car trunk and released there. The case is
complicated and murky, but it was widely believed to involve efforts to
embarrass the elder Kovac.</TE>
<TE>   At the time, the son faced allegations of business fraud in
Germany--charges of which he was cleared--and observers assumed that the
kidnappers hoped Austria would send him there to face trial. Instead
Austria returned him to Slovakia.</TE>
<TE>   A report by the Commission on Security and Cooperation in Europe, a
U.S. government agency, noted that the first Slovak police investigator
in charge of the case was removed after he said he had found evidence
implicating the government's intelligence service. His successor was
removed after concurring with that view.</TE>
<TE>   "The attempt to tie this kidnapping to me, the Slovak government and
my party was right from the beginning fabricated," Meciar said in the
recent interview. He granted the amnesty for anyone involved in the case
"only for the good of the state" because there was a risk that the elder
Kovac would be implicated in the "hiding of evidence" and "false
witnesses," he said.</TE>
<TE>   While Meciar's explanations satisfy his supporters, they have not gone
over well outside the country. "At home we are understood as real
people," Meciar said, but "abroad, a certain 'virtual reality' has been
created."</TE>
<TE>   In recent months, Western diplomats have been waging a campaign to
ensure that Slovaks understand there will be a price to pay if Meciar
returns to power.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. Ambassador Ronald Weiser told Bratislava's Radio Express last
month that Slovakia is doing "a good job" of meeting the military
criteria for joining NATO. "The only other obstacle that would face you
is the outcome of your elections and whether your new government will
share the values of the NATO alliance," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The interviewer asked for comment on the possibility that Meciar might
win the elections.</TE>
<TE>   "I think people need to vote for whomever they feel can best lead
their government in the future," Weiser replied. "That government will
choose whether it wants to seek an invitation to NATO, and NATO will
choose whether it wants Slovakia as a partner."</TE>
<TE>   Meciar responds to such comments by arguing that he shares the values
of the alliance, that the controversy over this issue mainly reflects an
effort by the ruling coalition to hang on to power, and that it is
undemocratic for NATO countries to pressure Slovak voters.</TE>
<TE>   "There exists a certain rule that is respected by all democratic
states: the right of citizens to select their own representatives,"
Meciar said. "It would be better not to try to frighten the Slovaks that
they will be punished and not be given guarantees for international
security if they vote according to their own conscience."</TE>
<TE>   Once this nation has joined NATO, he added, "you will have to respect
the right of Slovakia to a free election."</TE>

<HD>First Witness Takes Stand in War Court</HD>
<DH>Tribunal: Ethnic Albanian testifies that the invasion of Kosovo was
planned.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>THE HAGUE
</DL>
<LD>Former Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic heard the first
prosecution witness in his war crimes trial testify Monday about a
Yugoslav scorched-earth plan to kill Kosovo Muslims.</LD>
<LD>   Mahmut Bakali, an ethnic Albanian and former head of Kosovo's
Communist Party, said he heard of the plan for a Serb invasion of Kosovo
from the Serbian head of security in 1997, David Gajic.</LD>
<LD>   "It was the plan of Serbia, or a plan of Milosevic," he said. "This
would be insanity on a large scale."</LD>
<TE>   The testimony moved the trial into its second phase after prosecutors
and Milosevic spent a week laying out their cases in opening statements.
Earlier Monday, Milosevic ended a three-day tirade against "new
colonialism" by the West. He is on trial on 66 counts of war crimes
during the 1991-99 Balkan wars.</TE>
<TE>   With its first witness, the prosecution began to build its case that
Serb brutalities were premeditated and well planned.</TE>
<TE>   Bakali said the plan he heard from Gajic was intended "to destroy 700
Kosovo Albanian-populated settlements and to destroy property and to
destroy people." He said he warned the security chief that the blitz
would result in war.</TE>
<TE>   Bakali was fired by the Yugoslav leadership in 1980 for allegedly
organizing pro-independence protests by ethnic Albanians. He disappeared
from public view until 1998, when he became a member of an ethnic
Albanian delegation that negotiated the reopening of Albanian-language
universities in Kosovo. He met several times with Milosevic that year.
Kosovo is a province of Serbia, the main Yugoslav republic.</TE>
<TE>   Describing one of the meetings, Bakali said: "I told him, 'You are
killing women and children,' " referring to a police action in the
village of Prekaz that left more than 40 people dead in early 1998.</TE>
<TE>   Milosevic apparently replied, "We are fighting against terrorism." He
said the police had given the residents two hours to flee, but they
didn't, according to Bakali.</TE>

<HD>President, Koizumi Cheer Each Other On</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>EDWIN CHEN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>TOKYO
</DL>
<LD>It was only their fourth meeting. But President Bush and Japanese
Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi apparently see eye to eye on so many
issues that Koizumi said after their latest session Monday, "I feel as if
we've met each other umpteen times already."</LD>
<LD>   After more than 4 1/2 hours together in a variety of settings, Bush
and Koizumi heaped praise on each other.</LD>
<LD>   Their rapport is just one of several personal relationships that Bush
has nurtured with other world leaders, including Mexican President
Vicente Fox, British Prime Minister Tony Blair and Russian President
Vladimir V. Putin.</LD>
<TE>   What was striking here was the staunch public support that Bush and
Koizumi provided each other at a time when both are catching
flak--Koizumi for his handling of Japan's economy and Bush for bellicose
rhetoric suggesting that he might expand the U.S. counterterrorism
campaign beyond Afghanistan, with or without allied support.</TE>
<TE>   In short, they needed each other, and neither let the other down.</TE>
<TE>   The mutual love fest resumed this morning as Bush, in an address to
the Japanese parliament, said of Koizumi:</TE>
<TE>   "I value my relationship with the prime minister. . . . I trust him. I
enjoy his sense of humor. I consider him a close friend. He reminds me of
the new American star, Ichiro [Suzuki of baseball's Seattle Mariners]:
The prime minister can hit anything you throw at him."</TE>
<TE>   Bush's speech amounted to a combination pep talk to Japan and
affirmation of U.S. military commitments throughout Asia, including in
the Philippines and South Korea--even as he spoke of peace.</TE>
<TE>   "We seek a peaceful region where no power, or coalition of powers,
endangers the security or freedom of other nations, where military force
is not used to resolve political disputes," the president said.</TE>
<TE>   He also invoked the broad desire on the Korean peninsula for
reunification between the North and the South, saying: "We seek a region
in which demilitarized zones and missile batteries no longer separate
people with a common heritage and a common future."</TE>
<TE>   Bush urged Japan to "move forward boldly with [economic] reform and
restructuring," and he concluded by expressing his confidence that
"Japan's greatest era lies ahead."</TE>
<TE>   The assembled lawmakers gave him a rousing welcome.</TE>
<TE>   Shortly afterward, Bush flew to Seoul, where he probably faces a
chillier reception because of his recent demonization of North Korea.
Some in the South view that as having undermined South Korean President
Kim Dae Jung's "sunshine policy" of rapprochement with the government in
Pyongyang.</TE>
<TE>   On Wednesday, Bush is scheduled to confer with Kim and then visit U.S.
troops at the demilitarized zone that separates North and South Korea.</TE>
<TE>   In Tokyo, Bush and Koizumi began their quality time together Monday at
9:30 on a brilliant, almost balmy morning, sitting side by side at an
archery exhibition performed by mounted horsemen, called yabusame.</TE>
<TE>   Then they commenced a one-on-one discussion. Just before they sat
down, Koizumi presented Bush with a large framed print of a mounted
archer like those they had just seen--except the face bore a distinct
likeness to the leader of the free world.</TE>
<TE>   Chuckling, Bush quipped: "We're fighting evil."</TE>
<TE>   He and Koizumi talked for more than half an hour before senior aides
joined them. The expanded group worked through lunch, served in red
lacquer boxes.</TE>
<TE>   Bush set the tone for the day as he told reporters just before he and
Koizumi began their first meeting, "I plan on talking about what a great
reformer he is, and how he's going to be reforming the economy and how
we've got great confidence in his ability to lead this country."</TE>
<TE>   With that preview, no one was surprised when Koizumi emerged decidedly
upbeat.</TE>
<TE>   "We were able to exchange views on almost everything," he remarked,
adding that the sessions enabled the leaders to "renew our friendship and
cement further our relationship of trust and reaffirm the importance of
the Japan-U.S. alliance."</TE>
<TE>   Bush spared Koizumi any public loss of face by offering no
suggestions--public or private--on how the prime minister might speed a
desperately needed economic recovery here.</TE>
<TE>   "First of all, before I had a chance to bring up the economy, the
prime minister brought up the economy," Bush reported, adding that
Koizumi launched into a detailed explanation of his economic revival
plan.</TE>
<TE>   While some Bush administration officials have criticized Koizumi's
go-slow approach, Bush himself refrained from doing so, explaining: "I'm
not here to give advice. I'm here to lend support.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm confident in this man's leadership ability. I'm confident in his
strategy, and I'm confident in his desire to implement that strategy,"
Bush declared.</TE>
<TE>   For his part, Koizumi didn't stop after complimenting Bush's "strong
leadership" in the war on terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   He also came to Bush's defense for having characterized Iraq, Iran and
North Korea as an "axis of evil."</TE>
<TE>   "The expression 'axis of evil,' I believe, reflects the firm resolve
of President Bush and the United States against terrorism," Koizumi said.
"President Bush, I believe, has been very calm and cautious vis-a-vis
Iraq, Iran and North Korea."</TE>
<TE>   Koizumi provided still more cover for the U.S. leader on another hot
topic.</TE>
<TE>   Although Bush has rejected the international Kyoto treaty on global
warming, which seeks to curb the emission of greenhouse gases--a pact
that Japan supports--Koizumi hailed Bush's recent "very positive
proposal" as an alternative to the treaty. The Bush plan emphasizes
voluntary efforts, which the president has said would protect American
jobs.</TE>
<TE>   At their news conference, Koizumi even echoed Bush's mantra, noting
that "the problems of environment and the problems of economy . . .
should proceed hand in hand, and they should not run counter to each
other."</TE>
<TE>   The two men's relaxed relationship surfaced during their back and
forth on global warming.</TE>
<TE>   First, Koizumi observed that he thought voluntary restraints on
greenhouse gas emissions might not be enough.</TE>
<TE>   "We appreciate the stance shown by the United States to contribute on
that front . . . and we will expect greater efforts in that respect," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   But moments later, when a reporter asked Koizumi a question premised
on the United States' having signed the Kyoto treaty, Bush interjected
before Koizumi could reply, saying, "The . . . question is moot."</TE>
<TE>   After an afternoon respite, Bush and Koizumi got together again at a
reception that the prime minister held at his official residence for the
president and First Lady Laura Bush.</TE>
<TE>   As the trio--Koizumi is divorced--descended a long staircase, the
prime minister finally saw fit to offer Bush some unvarnished advice.</TE>
<TE>   As they stopped midway to pose for photographs, Koizumi turned to Bush
and said in English, "Shake hands."</TE>
<TE>   Bush promptly complied.</TE>

<HD>Bush Is Dogged by 'Axis of Evil' in Visit to Japan</HD>
<DH>Asia: Protesters, media criticize remarks and express concern over
Washington's plans.</DH>

</DL>
<LD>President Bush may be on a swing through Asia, but the issue that
is increasingly shaping his visit, in public anyway, is the "axis of
evil."</LD>
<LD>   Editorials are warning about the dangerous implications for the world
of the president's characterization of Iraq, Iran and North Korea.
Demonstrators are protesting the possibility of a new U.S. military
campaign. And both Bush and his senior staff are increasingly on the
defensive as they are deluged with questions about the administration's
plans for dealing with the three countries.</LD>
<LD>   "We want to resolve all issues peacefully, whether it be Iraq, Iran or
North Korea," the president said Monday when pressed about his intentions
by a Japanese reporter at a joint news conference with Prime Minister
Junichiro Koizumi.</LD>
<TE>   Afterward, Secretary of State Colin L. Powell hastened to tell
reporters traveling with the president that America's allies should not
fear "a state of war tomorrow." He added, "Let's not swoon."</TE>
<TE>   The president's six-day tour was designed to boost relations with the
three countries most critical to long-term U.S. interests in the
Asia-Pacific region: Japan, South Korea and China. Yet in an editorial,
the Japanese daily Asahi Shimbun charged that Bush's comments have
increased regional tensions and displayed a complete disregard for local
sensitivities, while the Okinawa Times said the U.S. is following a
misguided law-of-the-jungle approach.</TE>
<TE>   "America's aggressive threats, instead of reducing North Korea's
isolation, threaten to further isolate that country and spur
instability," the Okinawa paper said. "If America takes the military
steps it's threatened, there's no logical basis to its war on terror."</TE>
<TE>   Student, labor and civic group protesters voiced their own disapproval
of the Bush comments Monday in a series of modest demonstrations in
Tokyo, Hiroshima and Osaka.</TE>
<TE>   In one display, a band from the civic group Peace Boat danced in
Tokyo's crowded Shinjuku district sporting banners that read, "Who's the
Real Axis of Evil?" beside a cartoon of the president.</TE>
<TE>   "Bush is evil axis No. 1," said Peace Boat spokeswoman Hanna
Jongepier.</TE>
<TE>   And Japan is likely to be the most receptive of the three nations Bush
will visit.</TE>
<TE>   Despite his attempt Monday to reassure America's allies, Bush
continued to hammer away at the theme of the United States' intent to
deal with the "axis" countries.</TE>
<TE>   "There should be no mistake about it. We will defend our interests,"
he said at the news conference.</TE>
<TE>   When pressed on whether the U.S. would go it alone if coalition
partners balked, Bush replied, "We cannot allow nations that aren't
transparent, nations with a terrible history, nations that are so
dictatorial they're willing to starve their people, to mate up with
terrorist organizations."</TE>
<TE>   World leaders he's talked to "fully understand, exactly, what needs to
happen," the president added.</TE>
<TE>   Koizumi expressed strong support for the U.S.-led fight against
terrorism. But there are growing signs that the public in Japan, the
closest U.S. ally in Asia, is wary of what looks to be the next phase of
the campaign--which could in turn influence the government's position.</TE>
<TE>   For many Japanese, Bush's good-versus-evil language is unsettling on
less concrete grounds, as the product of a world view that sees black and
white but doesn't always seem to appreciate the area in between where
most people live.</TE>
<TE>   "It underscores the rather childish U.S. diplomacy," said Kazuto
Suzuki, a professor at the University of Tsukuba. "He's thrown up a
stereotype, but there's no hard evidence behind his charges."</TE>
<TE>   Military issues also remain controversial in a nation with a
constitution that bans the use of force in settling disputes. In
addition, Japanese are concerned about the costs at a time when their
debt-laden nation faces both mounting budget problems and the threat of a
banking meltdown.</TE>
<TE>   "Japan wants to know how much it will need to contribute to future
international efforts," said Tetsuo Maeda, a defense expert at Tokyo
International University. "We're already at the limit of what we can do
financially and politically."</TE>
<TE>   Many Japanese also fear the repercussions of any campaign against Iran
or Iraq--countries from which Japan buys oil--or North Korea. In the
Mideast, the fallout could be substantial for an energy-dependent nation.</TE>
<TE>   "Other Middle Eastern nations would react negatively to any attack, so
any move by Japan in support of a U.S. campaign could spell trouble for
Japanese energy security," said Isamu Nakashima, a researcher at the
Middle East Institute of Japan.</TE>
<TE>   Japan is home to about 1.7 million residents of Korean descent. North
Asians, in addition, prefer accommodation over confrontation.</TE>
<TE>   "If the U.S. pushes too hard, it could backfire," said Ken Takada, a
representative of the Coalition Against Constitutional Reform, a
Tokyo-based civic group.</TE>
<TE>   Bush's comments have already angered many second- and third-generation
Koreans living in Japan's second-largest city, said Tokuo Baba, a
representative of the Osaka Municipal Labor Union.</TE>
<TE>   "They completely undermine efforts to work toward peace on the Korean
peninsula," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Koizumi and Bush tried to make light of the "evil axis" questions.</TE>
<TE>   "This is the arrow to beat the evil and bring you everlasting peace,"
Koizumi said before presenting Bush with a print of a samurai
rider--whose face resembled the president's--shooting a bow and arrow.</TE>

<HD>Americans Admire Bush's Tough Talk, Cheney Says</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TONY PERRY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SAN DIEGO
</DL>
<LD>Speaking to 2,500 Marines, Vice President Dick Cheney said Monday
that despite "a certain amount of hand-wringing in some quarters" about
President Bush's "axis of evil" comment, he believes that most Americans
admire Bush's tough talk.</LD>
<LD>   "Most Americans find it reassuring to have a commander in chief who
speaks the truth and means exactly what he says," Cheney said during a
speech on the tarmac at Marine Corps Air Station Miramar.</LD>
<LD>   Cheney suggested that the next stage in the war on terrorism may
involve strikes against countries that are stockpiling chemical,
biological and nuclear weapons.</LD>
<TE>   And he noted that of the Bush-designated "axis" countries--Iraq, Iran
and North Korea--Iraq has already used chemical weapons against its
ethnic Kurdish population and Iran.</TE>
<TE>   "Afghanistan is only the beginning of a long and unrelenting effort,"
Cheney said. " . . . Wherever threats are forming against our country, we
will respond, and we will respond decisively."</TE>
<TE>   Cheney's 10-minute speech--one of his few public appearances since
Sept. 11--brought repeated applause and shouts of support.</TE>
<TE>   "When something happens to this country, it really works me up," said
Lance Cpl. Chad Rains, 19, of Fremont, Calif.</TE>
<TE>   But after Cheney spoke, Rep. Susan A. Davis (D-San Diego) told
reporters that, among her constituents, a strike on Iraq would probably
draw less support than the Afghan war.</TE>
<TE>   Davis, one of several officials in the audience, said she believes
that there should be a "thorough discussion" in Congress before any
further military action.</TE>
<TE>   "I think sometimes it is better to be more moderate in your
statements," she said of the "axis of evil" comment. "But that is what
[Bush] thinks and felt necessary to say."</TE>
<TE>   The Miramar speech was Cheney's first stop on a four-day speaking and
fund-raising trip through California. Today, he is to speak at the
Richard Nixon presidential library in Yorba Linda.</TE>
<TE>   Cheney noted that war zone losses "have fallen heavily" on the 3rd
Marine Aircraft Wing based at Miramar. Seven Marines were killed in a
plane crash in Pakistan, and two were killed in a helicopter crash in
Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   And last week, two Camp Pendleton-based members of the 3rd Marine
Aircraft Wing died when a helicopter crashed near the Salton Sea.</TE>
<TE>   "The families of all these Marines can be forever proud," he said.</TE>

<HD>U.S. Seeks Japan's Help on Iran</HD>
<DH>Diplomacy: White House hopes Tokyo, a major trader with Tehran, can
pressure religious hard-liners.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBIN WRIGHT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>TOKYO
</DL>
<LD>The U.S. has asked Japan and a host of other allies to help prod
reformists in Iran's government to bring "under control" religious
hard-liners linked with developing weapons of mass destruction and arming
Palestinian extremists, senior Bush administration officials said here
Monday.</LD>
<LD>   In talks, President Bush asked Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro
Koizumi to work with other nations and act as a conduit to pass on
growing U.S. concerns about Tehran's activities, said an administration
official, who asked not to be named.</LD>
<LD>   The goal is "to see if the people who are reasonable can get the other
folks under control," the official said.</LD>
<TE>   "We want our friends to pass our concerns along, to say: 'Look, you
know, if you really want to go down a reasonable road, we're going to be
there with you at the end of that road. But we have concerns that Iran
has to address,' " the official told reporters traveling with Bush on his
six-day tour of Asia.</TE>
<TE>   In his State of the Union address last month, Bush described Iran as
one of three nations in an "axis of evil." Japan could play a
particularly important role in appealing to Tehran because Iran is a
major trading partner and the two nations have strong diplomatic
relations. Deputy Foreign Minister Mohsen Aminzadeh was in Tokyo just
days before Bush arrived Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   The appeal to Japan and other allies reflects the administration's new
strategy in dealing with the Islamic Republic, which is to urge reformers
elected to the presidency, parliament and local councils since 1997 to
stand up to hard-liners engaged in wrongdoing both at home and abroad.</TE>
<TE>   A second administration official complained Monday that Iran's
"bifurcated" regime confuses the outside world. Washington has had
trouble figuring out whether it is "being deceived by a good cop/bad cop
act" or whether Iran is in the midst of "a genuine transformation," he
said. The United States wants to work with Japan and other nations "to
make the real Iran stand up--whether it's the Iran of rounding up Al
Qaeda suspects on the one hand or the Iran of weapons of mass destruction
on the other," the official added.</TE>
<TE>   Iran has an unusual power structure in that for every traditionally
elected branch of government, there is a parallel body dominated by
religious conservatives, who have veto power over everything from who can
run for office to what legislation is allowed.</TE>
<TE>   Washington has seen some signs that its pressure is producing a
reaction. After the U.S. complained that Iran had not acted to stop Al
Qaeda members crossing the border from Afghanistan, Tehran announced last
week that it had arrested about 150 operatives loyal to Osama bin Laden,
although Foreign Minister Kamal Kharrazi acknowledged Monday that there
were no Al Qaeda members among them. About 70 are children and 40 are
women, he said.</TE>
<TE>   The United States has received "considerable support" from allies in
its new strategy toward Iran, the second official said.</TE>
<TE>   The approach underscores the fact that, despite Bush's tough talk, the
administration is still searching for ways to deal with Tehran.</TE>

<HD>Seoul Boosts Security After Protest</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BARBARA DEMICK</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SEOUL
</DL>
<LD>South Korean police beefed up security for President Bush's visit
after university students occupied the U.S. Chamber of Commerce here for
nearly three hours Monday, trashing furniture, breaking a window and
tossing anti-American pamphlets from the 45th-floor offices.</LD>
<LD>   It was the most dramatic in a series of protests around South Korea
against Bush's visit and an embarrassment to the government, which had
been trying to keep anti-American protests at bay on the eve of the
visit. Thirty-two students were arrested. The government said it would
increase security along the route of the president's motorcade in
anticipation of further disruptions.</LD>
<LD>   Also Monday, a South Korean legislator in the National Assembly called
Bush a "symbol of evil," prompting a shoving match among legislators.</LD>
<TE>   "Bush is a symbol of evil trying to perpetuate the division of the
Korean peninsula," said Song Seok Chan, a member of the ruling party.
President Kim Dae Jung later chastised him for the remark, and Song
issued an apology.</TE>
<TE>   The tumult at the Chamber of Commerce marked the first time an
American office here has been occupied since the 1980s. The
well-organized takeover was credited to Hanchongryon, a left-wing student
organization that at times has been banned for sympathizing with North
Korea.</TE>
<TE>   About 30 students, most of them dressed in suits and ties to disguise
themselves as a business delegation, appeared at 12:50 p.m. and pushed
their way into the locked headquarters by following employees returning
from their lunch break. The intruders then quickly overpowered a small
deployment of Korean policemen assigned to guard the offices.</TE>
<TE>   "They were relatively calm and told our staff to get out. . . . They
were shouting something about Bush. I couldn't understand, but I got the
feeling they weren't happy with him," said Tami Overby, executive
director of the chamber, as she waded through the trashed offices in this
city's Trade Tower on Monday afternoon.</TE>
<TE>   "I locked myself in the computer room, where I called the police,"
Overby said. "There was pushing and shoving. It was intimidating, but I
was not worried for my safety. At no time did I feel like they were going
to kill us."</TE>
<TE>   Inside the offices, the students broke a large window and dangled from
it a banner protesting Bush's visit to South Korea. They also scattered
literature to the streets below decrying U.S. arms sales and Washington's
tough policy toward North Korea.</TE>
<TE>   "Can America, which produces and exports most of the arms to the
world, point the finger at arms sales by North Korea?" demanded one
pamphlet.</TE>
<TE>   The students overturned furniture to build a barricade against police
and held out for nearly three hours before they were overpowered by 1,000
riot officers, some using ropes to climb down the side of the building.
Thirty-two protesters were arrested.</TE>
<TE>   Jeffrey Jones, the chamber president in Seoul, said it was the most
serious incident in the organization's 50-year history here. Student
radicals occupied the chamber's offices twice before, most recently in
1987 during a wave of protests over what demonstrators perceived as U.S.
support for the authoritarian regime then in power in South Korea, Jones
said.</TE>
<TE>   Jones said he did not believe that the attack indicated widespread
hostility toward Americans or U.S. companies in South Korea.</TE>
<TE>   Police apologized to the Chamber of Commerce, saying they had
anticipated a protest by students but did not expect it to be so large.</TE>
<TE>   North Korea, which has been encouraging anti-American protests in
official media broadcasts, gloated over the incident.</TE>
<TE>   "The entire South Korean territory is fiercely seething with anti-U.S.
and antiwar rage as the U.S. Bush administration continues to criticize
our republic and spew out hard-line, absurd remarks," North Korean radio
said Monday.</TE>

<DH>S. America: Peruvian court quashes the U.S. woman's attempt to void
her 20-year sentence for aiding rebels.</DH>

<DL>LIMA, Peru
</DL>
<LD>Peru's Supreme Court has upheld a 20-year prison sentence against
American Lori Berenson for collaborating with leftist rebels in a
thwarted plot to seize Congress, the presiding justice said Monday.</LD>
<LD>   The panel was Berenson's last option for an appeal in the Peruvian
justice system.</LD>
<LD>   Berenson, 32, was convicted in June of terrorist collaboration in a
failed bid by the Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement to take over Peru's
Congress in 1995. She was acquitted of being a member of the rebel group.</LD>
<TE>   The New York native was convicted in 1996 by a military tribunal and
has served more than five years. Her original sentence of life in prison
was overturned in August 2000 and a new trial was ordered after years of
U.S. pressure.</TE>
<TE>   Supreme Court Judge Guillermo Cabala said four of the five judges
voted to uphold the 20-year sentence. One judge voted to reduce it to 15
years.</TE>
<TE>   Her parents, Mark and Rhoda Berenson of New York, have begun a
campaign to pressure Peruvian President Alejandro Toledo to grant her a
pardon.</TE>
<TE>   President Bush will visit Peru on March 23 to discuss trade and
combating drug trafficking and terrorism with Toledo. Peruvian Foreign
Minister Diego Garcia Sayan last week did not rule out discussion of
Berenson's case by the leaders.</TE>
<TE>   Also Monday, a former Peruvian army intelligence officer, who was
tortured and left partially paralyzed by fellow agents in 1997 for
allegedly leaking secrets about the hard-line rule of then-President
Alberto Fujimori, received $120,000 and an official apology.</TE>
<TE>   Leonor La Rosa's case highlighted the repression for which Peru's
intelligence services were feared under Fujimori.</TE>

<HD>Drowning Trial Opens; Sanity a Focus</HD>
<DH>Court: Lawyers argue over a Texas mother's state of mind when her
five young children died at home in a bathtub.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MEGAN K. STACK</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>HOUSTON
</DL>
<LD>Every glance and every word will be dredged up and reexamined for
traces of lucidity as a jury decides whether a Christian homemaker was
insane when she drowned her five children in a bathtub.</LD>
<LD>   As the trial of Andrea Pia Yates got underway Monday, the
jury--dominated by women--listened to a painfully detailed re-creation of
June 20, 2001. That was the morning that Yates fed her children a
breakfast of dry cereal and then killed them, one by one.</LD>
<LD>   Prosecutors say she wrapped the bodies in a bed sheet, phoned her
husband and said: "I finally did it."</LD>
<TE>   Yates, who is charged with two counts of capital murder for the deaths
of three of her children, slipped into the courtroom Monday wearing a
long, dark dress. She looked puffy, and her hair was so thin that her
scalp shone through under the courtroom lights. She murmured "not guilty"
by reason of insanity so softly that Judge Belinda Hill asked her to
repeat the plea.</TE>
<TE>   Her lawyers describe the 37-year-old as a doting mother who had been
taken off psychotropic drugs and was too sick and delusional to know what
she was doing. Yates' father had died a few months earlier, they said,
and she blamed herself.</TE>
<TE>   In his opening argument, defense lawyer George Parnham invoked the
litany of doctors who treated Yates through years of suicide attempts,
electroshock therapy and crippling postpartum psychosis.</TE>
<TE>   "She not only didn't know what she was doing, but she believed it was
right," Parnham told the panel of four men and eight women. "She did not
appreciate the lawfulness of her acts."</TE>
<TE>   But prosecutors say the deaths of Noah, 7; John, 5; Paul, 3; Luke, 2;
and six-month-old Mary were carried out meticulously--and that Yates
showed clear signs of comprehension and remorse.</TE>
<TE>   Yates sat calmly on a love seat while investigators swarmed the house,
pointing out clean glasses for water and keys to unlock the back door.
Later that day, she told a detective she was bound for hell for killing
her children.</TE>
<TE>   "She knew it was illegal, that it was a sin, that it was wrong,"
prosecutor Joe Owmby told the jury.</TE>
<TE>   To succeed with an insanity defense, Yates' lawyers will have to
persuade the jury that she was unable to distinguish right from wrong.</TE>
<TE>   If Yates is found insane, she could be sent to a hospital for the
mentally ill. Otherwise, she could face life in prison--or be executed in
a Texas death chamber.</TE>
<TE>   Yates' husband, Russell, spent Monday in the corridors outside the
courtroom. He will testify in his wife's defense later in the trial,
which is expected to last two weeks.</TE>
<TE>   During Monday's testimony, the jury listened to the 911 call Andrea
Yates placed minutes after the last of her children died. Between ragged
breaths, Yates begged for the police but refused to explain why she
needed help.</TE>
<TE>   "I just need them to come," she said.</TE>
<TE>   "Do you have a disturbance?" the dispatcher asked. "Are you ill?"</TE>
<TE>   "Yes," Yates replied, "I'm ill."</TE>
<TE>   "You sure you're alone?"</TE>
<TE>   "No," Yates said. "My kids are here."</TE>
<TE>   The dispatch tape underscored the slim shades of meaning that will
become important in gauging Yates' mental health: Lawyers sparred
vigorously over whether she refused to explain or whether she was too
delusional, as her defense argued.</TE>
<TE>   "I have a feeling we're playing semantics here," defense lawyer
Wendell Odom said.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, Yates' fate could swing on semantics and detail. Over and
over, lawyers for both sides pressed witnesses on whether Yates made eye
contact, whether she appeared to understand and whether she displayed any
emotion.</TE>
<TE>   When Officer David Knapp arrived, Yates answered the door in soaked
clothing, hair dripping wet. Her eyes were wide and she minced no words.</TE>
<TE>   "She looked straight at me and said, 'I just killed my kids,' " Knapp
said. Then, the police officer testified, the mother turned and led him
past the puddles and footprints on the tile floor, over the soggy carpet
and into the darkened master bedroom. There was a mattress on the floor.</TE>
<TE>   "I noticed a small arm sticking out from under the covers," Knapp
said. "I saw what looked to be four lumps in the bed."</TE>
<TE>   It was the four youngest children, all dead. Noah was found floating
face down in the bathtub. The children still wore pajamas.</TE>
<TE>   Using a floor plan of the modest brick house, Knapp on Monday mapped
the trail of wet footprints--one adult set, one childlike--that were in
the hallway when he arrived.</TE>
<TE>   Yates settled onto a love seat in the sparsely furnished living room.</TE>
<TE>   "She just sat," Officer Frank Stumpo said Monday. "She was very stoic,
very calm. . . . I asked her if she realized what she'd done."</TE>
<TE>   "Did she make eye contact?" prosecutor Kaylynn Williford asked.</TE>
<TE>   "Yes," Stumpo said.</TE>
<TE>   "Did she make a response?"</TE>
<TE>   "She said, 'Yes, I do.' She looked directly at me and answered the
question very directly."</TE>
<TE>   Stumpo said that when he rummaged in the kitchen for a clean glass,
Yates directed him to the china cabinet. When he remarked on the
converted bus parked out back, she said, "We lived in there."</TE>
<TE>   As he marched her outside in handcuffs, she directed him to keys to
unlock the back door.</TE>
<TE>   As Stumpo drove to the jail, Yates sat in the back of the squad car.
By then the story had hit the airwaves, and a radio host launched into a
"harsh tirade" about the mother who had drowned her children. Stumpo
glanced in the rearview mirror.</TE>
<TE>   "She turned to the left and looked out the window. A sullen, quivering
look passed across her face," he told the jury. "She seemed very
embarrassed."</TE>

<HD>'Mega Landlord' Creates Mega Housing Mess</HD>
<DH>Rentals: Billionaire is evicting hundreds so he can sell for
investment purposes. Many of his Hawaiian properties carry bargain
prices.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SUSAN ESSOYAN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL>HONOLULU
</DL>
<LD>In a 1980s shopping spree, Japanese billionaire Gensiro Kawamoto
snapped up 800 homes in Hawaii and Northern California. Now he's selling,
setting off a bidding frenzy here and evicting whole neighborhoods in
Sacramento County.</LD>
<LD>   "I freaked when I got the eviction notice last week," said renter
Raquel Brandon, who shares a four-bedroom home in Citrus Heights, Calif.,
with her husband and three daughters. "Then I found out that 102 of my
neighbors were getting the same letter."</LD>
<LD>   In a terse written statement, Kawamoto said he was selling all 642
homes he owns in California and 80 of his Hawaii properties to raise
money for "tremendous investment opportunities both in the United States
and Japan, opportunities which present themselves only once every 20 to
30 years.</LD>
<TE>   "Time is of the essence," he wrote.</TE>
<TE>   The real estate tycoon is soliciting "drive-by" offers on his Honolulu
properties, made without benefit of a look inside and contingent on later
inspections. He has not yet notified his tenants here that they are soon
to be evicted.</TE>
<TE>   In California, he's taking the opposite approach. He's evicting
hundreds of tenants in the Sacramento and Santa Rosa areas with just 30
days' notice--but he hasn't listed those houses for sale yet. His
Honolulu law firm, Alston Hunt Floyd &amp; Ing, said last week there would be
no extensions to the eviction deadline.</TE>
<TE>   "Legally, he can throw us out--it's his property," said Brandon, whose
family has been paying $1,195 in monthly rent. "But this just isn't
right. He is willing to put thousands of people on the street, homeless."</TE>
<TE>   Unlike California, where he owns whole subdivisions, Kawamoto's houses
and condos in Honolulu are scattered through various neighborhoods.</TE>
<TE>   Tenants contacted in Honolulu were reluctant to speak out for fear of
jeopardizing their future. Some are bidding on their homes, or hope to
stay on as renters under a new owner.</TE>
<TE>   However, Kawamoto's attorney, Carol Asai-Sato, said Friday that
tenants "do not have a first right to buy." She would not elaborate.</TE>
<TE>Investor Bought 17 Homes in One Day</TE>
<TE>   Kawamoto was the most visible of a stampede of Japanese investors who
spent nearly $10 billion in Hawaii in the late 1980s. The maverick
investor shopped from a limousine, asking owners to "name their price"
and often buying property without even looking inside. At the peak of his
spree, he bought 17 homes in one day.</TE>
<TE>   He is selling the less expensive of his Hawaii properties, all on
Oahu, and many at bargain prices. Most are median-range, single-family
homes in suburbs such as Hawaii Kai and Kailua, along with some midtown
condominiums. Listing prices range from $250,000 to $450,000, with one
residence at $850,000.</TE>
<TE>   Many need repairs, but that's not stopping bids well over the asking
price.</TE>
<TE>   "The prices are very attractive," said Sonia Franzel, a real estate
agent for Cathy George &amp; Associates, who has placed three offers on
behalf of her clients. "I have heard of people overbidding, in some cases
by $50,000, to get the property. The three brokers handling the
properties are overwhelmed by the offers."</TE>
<TE>   Broker James Mazzola, of Coldwell Banker Pacific Properties, said he
had been told that Kawamoto set the prices himself. "It seems like he
just took what he paid and added $100,000 to it."</TE>
<TE>   "They are way below assessed value, which is very unusual in this
market," Sara VanDerWerff, a Coldwell Banker agent, said Sunday. "That's
why this is so exciting. Inventory is tight on the Windward side and in
Hawaii Kai. There's usually hardly anything in the $300,000 and $400,000
range."</TE>
<TE>   Her colleague, Linda Lovell, said houses with a market value of
$460,000 were listed as low as $250,000. She put in six offers on behalf
of local families eager to buy, five that were above the asking prices
and one at the asking price. She learned Sunday that all had been
rejected. "We're all disappointed," she said.</TE>
<TE>   When Kawamoto first arrived on the scene in the 1980s, Honolulu's
then-Mayor Frank Fasi accused him of running up home prices and
unsuccessfully pushed for legislation to prohibit sales of residences to
foreigners.</TE>
<TE>   Kawamoto then tried to get involved in building affordable housing
here. He abandoned those plans after spats with local officials, and
turned his sights on California.</TE>
<TE>   The "mega landlord" now owns 420 houses in the Sacramento-area
communities of Citrus Heights, Orangevale, Antelope and Rocklin, where he
financed construction of moderate-income subdivisions, and 160 rental
units in Santa Rosa.</TE>
<TE>   Kawamoto said he plans to put them on the market "once I locate one or
more reputable brokerage companies in California."</TE>
<TE>   Some of his tenants have lived in their homes for more than a decade.
Most are on month-to-month leases, which allow eviction with 30 days'
notice.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm so upset," Brandon said. "We don't know what we're going to do."</TE>
<TE>   Officials are scrambling to come up with relocation help and
alternative housing for the displaced tenants, including the possible use
of units at the former McClellan Air Force Base, said state Sen. Deborah
Ortiz (D-Sacramento). They also hope to help muster financing for renters
to buy their homes if possible.</TE>
<TE>Officials Appeal to Japanese Ambassador</TE>
<TE>   Ortiz and three state Assembly members from the Sacramento area are
appealing to Japan's ambassador to the United States, Ryozo Kato, for his
"help in averting this potential tragedy."</TE>
<TE>   Their letter asks him to prevail upon Kawamoto "to reconsider this
brash and drastic action that threatens entire neighborhoods of families,
disrupts children's lives and education and destroys the local housing
market."</TE>
<TE>   "We've got such a tight rental market," Ortiz said. "Our vacancy rates
are so low, there's no way we're going to absorb all these families in
our region."</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>A doctor on trial in the deaths of four patients who overdosed on
OxyContin is no different from a drug dealer, a prosecutor said in
closing arguments in Milton.</LD>
<LD>   Dr. James Graves, 55, testified that he did not know his patients were
abusing drugs and said no one would have died if OxyContin had been taken
as prescribed.</LD>
<LD>   The six-member jury is expected to begin deliberating today.</LD>
<TE>   Graves is charged with racketeering, four counts of manslaughter
through culpable negligence and five counts of unlawful delivery of a
controlled substance. If convicted on all counts, Graves could face up to
30 years in state prison.</TE>

<HD>Olympic Naysayers Turn Into Believers</HD>
<DH>Festivities: The usually quiet Salt Lake City is infused with a new
spirit. Locals cite mild disruptions such as long lines and extra
security.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE CHAWKINS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SALT LAKE CITY
</DL>
<LD>The city at night: Think of it as an exceedingly clean, mainly
sober Utah version of Mardi Gras.</LD>
<LD>   Even many who were reluctant to invite a global extravaganza to their
ordinarily quiet city find themselves swept along in the spirit of the
polyglot, parka-swathed, pin-trading hordes packing downtown sidewalks.</LD>
<LD>   "I thought I wouldn't have anything to do with it, but now I'm eating
my words," said Greg Pappas, a local commercial printer, as he stood in a
long line at Olympic Square, one of several free downtown Olympic
entertainment sites. "The traffic isn't as bad as they scared us into
thinking it would be, and I've run into athletes who talk with you, guys
who are more customer friendly than a lot of pro basketball players."</LD>
<TE>   At times, police say the crowds downtown have topped 100,000--a figure
especially remarkable in a city of 180,000. On Saturday night, people
rang cowbells, and sidewalk musicians played bluegrass banjo, Greek
bouzouki, even classical cello. Celebrants flush with Canada's ice
skating victory wore maple-leaf decals on their cheeks, while others
sported USA berets, coonskin caps and hats made from twisted balloons. At
a sporting-goods store, two strangers stood transfixed by a big-screen
broadcast of curling.</TE>
<TE>   "Amazing," said one.</TE>
<TE>   "It's all amazing," said the other.</TE>
<TE>   Beside a granite monument at the site of Salt Lake City's first Sunday
school, a scalper just in from New York trolled for extra tickets. Asked
what he'd pay, he said: "Give me a women's cross-country biathlon and I
wouldn't give you a doughnut. Give me a hockey and we'll talk."</TE>
<TE>   Although scalpers complain that business is soft, tickets for such
high-profile events as figure skating go for a cool $250 on the street.
Tickets to the Medals Plaza are $75, a price fueled by residents selling
scalpers some of the 80,000 that were given away in a drawing last month.</TE>
<TE>   That such prices put many events out of reach didn't bother Carlene
George, a community college advisor who has shepherded her students to a
number of free events.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm having the time of my life," said George as she gazed at a
25-story banner, draped over the Mormon Church's main office building,
depicting a mid-twirl figure skater.</TE>
<TE>   In Olympic Square, throngs waited patiently in Disneyland-style lines,
listening to official Olympic greetings recorded by Alex Trebek of
"Jeopardy" and Utah Gov. Mike Leavitt. After about 30 minutes, they
reached the metal detectors--and earned the opportunity to queue up in
even longer lines for hot dogs and souvenirs.</TE>
<TE>   At the Olympic Superstore, the grand location of official doodads,
uncomplaining crowds waited 40 minutes to get in and then another 40
minutes to make it to the cash register. The wait was about as long for
Pfizer pharmaceutical company's three-minute test to "determine your
ideal Olympic sport."</TE>
<TE>   But waiting is an unrecognized Olympic demonstration sport all its
own.</TE>
<TE>   "The other night, I waited 2 1/2 hours for an eight-second luge ride,"
said Tara McMillin of suburban Sandy. "But what could I do? I was on a
date."</TE>
<TE>   Three women carrying hockey sticks and wearing lots of makeup, Viking
helmets and long robes posed for pictures with tourists.</TE>
<TE>   "Hockey opera," one of them explained, warbling a few off-key notes.</TE>
<TE>   Crowds watched ice carvers hack away at huge blocks with chain saws.
Groups clustered around entertainers--here a contingent from the Air
Force Academy's Band of the Rockies, there the Sweet Adelines.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, the big draws downtown are at the Medals Plaza, where
athletes bodysurf above the crowd as bands such as the Goo Goo Dolls and
'N Sync rock for about 20,000 roaring fans.</TE>
<TE>   Blocks away, a similar-sized crowd jams the huge Mormon Conference
Center for a production called "Light of the World," an epic that traces
the painful saga of the early Mormons and ties their perseverance to that
of Olympic athletes. About 1,500 performers participate, including the
Mormon Tabernacle Choir, local schools and ethnic dance troupes.</TE>
<TE>   Outside, the trees of Temple Square blaze with red and white lights
and crowds gaze at the sky for nightly fireworks.</TE>
<TE>   "I just love the feel of it," said Jan Robinson, a nurse from Sandy.
"I've been here twice and I've had so much fun I had to drag my husband
with me."</TE>
<TE>   To be sure, there are complaints. Some businesses outside the heart of
the city say they're languishing, victims of local officials and media
who cast Olympic traffic as something akin to a visitation of locusts.</TE>
<TE>   But for most, life has been only mildly disrupted.</TE>
<TE>   A local women's bowling league canceled play during the Olympics to
spare its members traffic headaches. The University of Utah couldn't give
law boards and other tests because of heavy security on the campus where
many athletes bunk. Maids who clean apartments across from the university
have to pass through metal detectors before they can start their
scrubbing.</TE>
<TE>   For people like Seattle transplant Kurt Kuykendall, such
inconveniences are worth it.</TE>
<TE>   Eating breakfast at a restaurant counter, he said he was delighted to
see people on the streets when he got off work at 3 a.m.</TE>
<TE>   "It looked like a city," said Kuykendall, a hospital worker. "The only
other time I saw people really excited was when the Jazz made the
playoffs."</TE>

<HD>WWII Hero Who Faked Being White Gets Honors</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>BEAR LAKE, Mich.
</DL>
<LD>A light-skinned black man who pretended to be white so he could
fight for the U.S. military in World War II was honored posthumously
Monday for his outstanding bravery.</LD>
<LD>   Calvin Clark Davis flew 50 missions in the Pacific theater-- enough to
exempt him from further combat--but he then volunteered to fight in
Europe, where he was killed during a bombing run over Germany.</LD>
<LD>   On Monday, Davis' family received seven military medals honoring his
service, including his World War II Victory Medal and the Purple Heart.</LD>
<TE>   "This is one of the most incredible stories of dedication to country I
have ever heard," said Rep. Peter Hoekstra (R-Mich.), who read a
description of each medal as Rep. John Conyers Jr (D-Mich.) presented
them.</TE>
<TE>   Hoekstra said Davis was one of many blacks who passed themselves off
as white so they wouldn't be relegated to noncombat duty under
segregation rules.</TE>
<TE>   "Even [with] the imperfections and the hostility that was shown to
them by their country, they loved America," Hoekstra said at a ceremony
before students at Davis' alma mater, Bear Lake High School.</TE>
<TE>   Davis was descended from a white plantation owner and a black slave,
said Calvin Murphy, Davis' cousin who worked for two years to obtain the
medals for the relative he never knew.</TE>
<TE>   Murphy, 54, came across a newspaper article a couple of years ago
saying Davis might have been in line for medals and he contacted numerous
agencies, including Hoekstra's office.</TE>
<TE>   "I just wanted him to get what he's entitled to, and I wanted to make
sure his story would live on after I'm gone," Murphy said.</TE>
<TE>   Orphaned as a child, Davis was raised in poverty by his older sister.
But Davis' race was never an issue in the rural northeastern Michigan
village, said Lester Reed, 88, one of Davis' former classmates.</TE>
<TE>   "He looked about as white as you or me. His sister was black, but
nobody paid any attention to it," Reed said.</TE>
<TE>   Davis enlisted in the 5th U.S. Army Air Force in May 1941. He was
among a bomber crew that received the Distinguished Flying Cross for
heroism during an attack on a Japanese airfield in 1943.</TE>
<TE>   Once Davis was transferred to Europe, he became a radio operator
aboard a B-17 bomber. On Nov. 30, 1944, his plane and another collided
during an attack on German oil refineries. Six of the bomber's nine
crewmen, including Davis, were killed.</TE>
<TE>   Hoekstra said he and Conyers were still researching whether Davis
should receive the Silver Star and Medal of Honor.</TE>
<TE>   "He should be honored not only for his heroic efforts as a soldier,
but for his willingness to serve a country that did not necessarily want
his service," Conyers said.</TE>

<HD>Latest Welfare Concern: How to Make Work Pay</HD>
<DH>Aid: As reform bill nears time for renewal, Congress clashes over
how to help struggling former recipients.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JONATHAN PETERSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>Slashing the welfare rolls may have been the easy part: Government
officials are now girding for a new clash over welfare reform centered on
the plight of working poor Americans who left public aid but continue to
struggle in poverty.</LD>
<LD>   The newest ranks of working poor are the product of welfare policies
that have steered recipients into the work force and set time limits on
how long they may collect public aid. Such workers can be found toiling
in restaurant kitchens, sweeping office buildings, attending the
bedridden and engaging in countless other labors that pay at or near the
minimum wage.</LD>
<LD>   Their numbers have grown--perhaps by 1 million or more--at a time when
the overall poverty rate has declined and many low-income workers have
been edging up the economic ladder.</LD>
<TE>   "They're playing by the rules. They're doing what they can to help
their families," said Isabel V. Sawhill, a poverty expert at the
Brookings Institution in Washington. "The question becomes: What do you
do for them? How do we make work pay?"</TE>
<TE>   It is a question being asked increasingly in Congress, which must
decide this year whether to alter the huge changes in welfare it began in
1996. Already, some lawmakers are proposing billions of dollars more for
child care and financial rewards for states that reduce poverty.</TE>
<TE>   The White House would continue funding welfare at its current level of
about $16.5 billion and also reinstate certain provisions, including a
$2-billion fund to help states through hard times, which expired last
year.</TE>
<TE>   But unlike the rancorous debate of the 1990s, when Congress turned
vast control over welfare policy to the states and ended lifetime
entitlement to benefits, the new discussion is noteworthy for areas of
agreement as well as areas of dispute.</TE>
<TE>   Many Republicans and Democrats want welfare reform to stay on course,
with work remaining the preeminent goal. Democrats have become more
amenable to conservative initiatives aimed at encouraging marriage and
family stability among the poor. Republicans have become much less
frustrated with the welfare system and more sympathetic to beneficiaries,
who are increasingly likely to work for part of their income.</TE>
<TE>   "Ironically, welfare reform may have the best chance for bipartisan
agreement of any issue this year, which shows we've come a long way in
the last six years," said Bruce Reed, president of the Democratic
Leadership Council and a top advisor to President Clinton on welfare
reform in the 1990s.</TE>
<TE>   Nonetheless, evidence that many former beneficiaries still struggle
with poverty is at the heart of an ideological schism, dividing those who
wish to plow new public resources into welfare from others who argue the
program doesn't need fixing. Funding for welfare reform will run out at
the end of September, sparking new conflicts as members hash out plans to
renew the program.</TE>
<TE>   Among the areas in dispute:</TE>
<TE>   * Requirements for work and education. The Bush administration wants
to stiffen the work rules, which states found easy to meet under the 1996
law. But critics, citing the steep climb faced by former recipients, want
more time spent on education and training to count as time spent on the
job.</TE>
<TE>   * Taxpayer-supported child care. The rush of low-income single mothers
into the workplace has sparked huge new demands for child-care services.
A welfare bill by Rep. Benjamin L. Cardin (D-Md.) would hike spending on
child care by more than $11 billion. The Bush administration wants to
hold the line. (Current expenditures are about $4.8 billion, more if such
programs as Head Start are counted.)</TE>
<TE>   * Poverty reduction as a goal of welfare policy. Democrats would make
cutting poverty the official goal and pay states bonuses of millions of
dollars for progress. The Bush administration has responded with a more
vague goal of improving "child well-being."</TE>
<TE>   "We now need to turn our attention to reducing poverty levels and
promoting advancement in the work force," Cardin said, introducing the
Democrats' first major legislation in the new round of welfare reform.</TE>
<TE>   The administration sounds cooperative. Health and Human Services
Secretary Tommy G. Thompson recently told Congress that the
administration wished to "help those families that have left welfare to
climb the job ladder and become more secure in the work force."</TE>
<TE>   Census Bureau surveys suggest the total number of working poor,
including many who have never been involved in welfare, actually declined
during the 1990s boom. But evidence suggests that many single mothers who
left the welfare system for jobs--or combine welfare with private
employment--are far from secure.</TE>
<TE>   Vanessa Brown, a single mother in Philadelphia, recalled that when her
employer went belly up last October, she and other former welfare
recipients were hit with a sudden crisis.</TE>
<TE>   "I can't tell you how many people were crying when we walked out of
there," said Brown, 35, of the customer service firm that hired many
former welfare recipients. "They're relying on boyfriends and family.
Some of the girls are living in bad situations just to survive."</TE>
<TE>   Brown, who had been making $8.84 an hour, qualified for unemployment
benefits, but they will run out shortly. "I'm up in the air about how I'm
going to support myself," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Out of 2.8 million families that left welfare in the late 1990s, six
in 10 former adult recipients now work at least part of the year, studies
suggest. Typically, they earn $7 to $8 an hour. Many lack health-care
benefits and do not qualify for unemployment insurance if they lose their
jobs.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, many of the working poor have not entirely left welfare,
a striking if little-noticed development since the 1990s. Of the 2.1
million adults on welfare last fall, 1 in 3 were doing at least some
work, according to the Health and Human Services Department. The total of
new working poor--those whose personal circumstances have been affected
by welfare's stricter rules--is possibly as high as 1.2 million adults,
Sawhill said.</TE>
<TE>   "An increasing percentage of the poor are working poor," said Sawhill.</TE>
<TE>   In particular, many states claim they need more money for
services--including child care, transportation and training--to help
hard-pressed working people stay afloat.</TE>
<TE>   "We're almost a victim of our own success," said Sheri Steisel,
director of human services policy at the National Conference of State
Legislatures. "As more and more parents go to work, they need more and
more child care--to ensure that they're reliable employees."</TE>
<TE>   Some of the emerging skirmishes go beyond resources to basic
philosophy about welfare. For example, some advocates of the poor would
like to make more flexible the time limit for which a person can get
benefits--which typically has a lifetime cap of five years--so that the
clock would stop ticking for those recipients who are getting a paycheck
in addition to their welfare payment.</TE>
<TE>   But on the other side, defenders of the current approach argue that
easing the time clock would weaken a crucial incentive for people to
enter the work force.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it would be a huge mistake for there to be any backsliding on
time limits," said Wade F. Horn, assistant Health and Human Services
secretary for children and families. "It ain't broke. Show me it's
broken."</TE>

<HD>Ciena to Buy ONI Systems for $900 Million in Stock</HD>

<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Ciena Corp., the second-largest U.S. maker of fiber-optic telephone
equipment, will buy rival ONI Systems Corp. for $900 million in stock
and the assumption of $300 million in debt in a plan to add sales in
one of the only rising communications-gear markets, Ciena spokesman
Glenn Jasper said.</LD>
<LD>   The bid values ONI shares, down 87% in the last year, at about
$6.20, a 12% premium to Friday's closing price.</LD>
<LD>   Analysts expect both companies to lose money for two years as
customers such as Qwest Communications International Inc. pare
equipment spending. ONI is smaller than Ciena and specializes in gear
that boosts capacity on citywide fiber networks, one of the few areas
in which analysts expect spending to increase in 2002.</LD>
<TE>   "I don't think the near-term prospects for either company were
that good," said John Wilson, an RBC Capital Markets analyst who has
a "sector perform" rating on Ciena and doesn't own shares. "If the
industry environment was anything close to normal, you probably
wouldn't see a deal like this."</TE>
<TE>   Ciena, based in Linthicum, Md., is expected to have a loss of 66
cents a share in the fiscal year ending in October and 31 cents the
year after, the average estimates of analysts polled by IBES
International Inc. San Jose-based ONI is forecast to have losses of
65 cents a share this calendar year and 50 cents in 2003.</TE>
<TE>   ONI may catapult Ciena to first place in the market for network
gear in metropolitan areas. ONI's share fell to 26% in the third
quarter from 34% in the second, according to Dell'Oro Group of
Redwood City, Calif. Nortel Networks Corp. ranked first with 37%;
Ciena was third with 22%.</TE>
