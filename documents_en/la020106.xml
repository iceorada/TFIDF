<LD>On its surface, the new FX movie "Sins of the Father" examines the
arrest and indictment of Ku Klux Klan member Bobby Frank Cherry for
his participation in a notorious hate crime: the 1963 bombing of the
Sixteenth Street Baptist Church in Birmingham, Ala., which killed
four young African American girls.</LD>
<LD>   But the film is not a straightforward crime drama. "It isn't about
black against white," says the director, Robert Dornhelm ("Anne
Frank"). "It is about the dark side in each of us. It is trying to
show that we are all good and bad. It's about trying to suppress the
bad and let the good come out and triumph over the bad."</LD>
<LD>   Tom Sizemore stars in the movie, premiering Sunday on the cable
network, as Tom Cherry, the eldest son of Bobby Frank Cherry (Richard
Jenkins). Growing up in a large family in Birmingham, Tom Cherry
witnessed his mother's constant physical abuse at the hands of his
father. Tom always tried to win his father's love and acceptance but
more often than not was beaten and brutalized by him. He would
accompany his father to his Klan meetings and witnessed first-hand
the hate crimes his father and friends committed against the city's
African American community.</LD>
<TE>   When Tom reads about the FBI's reopening of the bombing case in
1998, he goes to visit his father, now living in a trailer in Texas.
But Bobby Frank Cherry hasn't changed; he is just as angry and
hateful as ever. During the emotionally taxing visit, Tom slowly
recalls memories of the events surrounding the bombing that he had
suppressed for years. With the help of a friend (Ving Rhames), Tom
finds the strength to testify against his father in front of a grand
jury.</TE>
<TE>   Bobby Frank Cherry was indicted in April 2000 but was sent to a
state mental institution until a board of psychiatrists could
determine whether he was mentally fit to stand trial. In early
December, a psychologist said during a competency hearing that
Cherry, now in his 70s, is indeed fit. The case is still pending.</TE>
<TE>   Executive producer Robert Cooper, CEO of Artisan Pictures and
former president of HBO Pictures, believes John Pielmeier's script to
be one of the film's major strengths.</TE>
<TE>   "I think there is a paradox," says Cooper, "that the more you are
dealing with weighty issues, the more important it is that the
writing be special and accessible, because otherwise it starts to
feel like a lecture and then you fall asleep at the wheel. What I
thought was pretty amazing about John Pielmeier is that he managed to
tell a story in a way that was very compelling without being
preaching."</TE>
<TE>   What attracted him to the story, says Cooper, is the fact that
"Sins of the Father" is about memory. "It is about a kid who grows up
and looks back on his past and realizes he chose to forget who is
father was. He puts the pieces of his memory together at the same
time the nation decides whether it is time to remember what the [men
who committed the crime] did 30 or 40 years ago."</TE>
<TE>   Tom Cherry visited the set in Toronto, but prior to production
Sizemore talked to him on the phone about 15 times over a six-week
period. "He told me his father was Hitler without the army," says
Sizemore.</TE>
<TE>   Since testifying against his father, Sizemore relates, Tom Cherry
has been completely ostracized by his family. "He's gotten hundreds
of death threats on the Internet. He told me the Klan is still going
on and it's even more dangerous now because they don't have capes, so
you can't identify them."</TE>
<TE>   Cherry and Sizemore got to be "pals," especially after Cherry
learned that the actor ("Saving Private Ryan," "Black Hawk Down") is
dating the former "Hollywood Madam," Heidi Fleiss. Sizemore recalls
that Cherry told him that Fleiss was the "'most charismatic woman I
have ever seen. Is there any way I can speak to her?' She ended up
talking to him for about an hour. [Cherry and I] were getting along
well, but that [conversation] broke a certain ice, and he seemingly
opened up to me in a way he might not have."</TE>
<TE>   "Sins of the Father" can be seen Sunday at 8 p.m. and 10 p.m. on
FX. The network has rated it TV-14-L-V (may be unsuitable for
children under 14, with advisories for language and violence).</TE>

<DH>THE NAUTICAL CHART: A Novel of Suspense, By Arturo
Perez-Reverte, Translated from the Spanish by Margaret Sayers Peden,
Harcourt: 466 pp., $26</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN BALZAR</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>All ahead, easy. Make for the Mediterranean. For adventure. Love.
Mystery. Treasure. Betrayal. What a lovely, well-rounded and
distinctive novel to lure us from troubled shores. In "The Nautical
Chart," Spain's best-selling author Arturo Perez- Reverte has
composed a contemporary and thoughtful suspense story of a seaman's
happenstance, a woman's obsession and a desperate voyage by Jesuits
that occurred 232 years earlier.</LD>
<LD>   I say "composed" not just in the literary but in the musical sense
of the word. This is a novel that reads ingeniously like jazz sounds,
sometimes holding on to its thoughts for an extra syncopated beat,
playing with them, digressing and then advancing unhurried. Early in
his story, Perez-Reverte prepares the reader for the tempo to follow.
Heaved ashore by bad luck, merchant sailor Coy, whose story this is,
kills time in a mildewed room in Barcelona. From a Walkman, he
listens to music: " ... (I)n which the bass had been sliding sweetly,
the trumpet of Miles Davis came in with his historic two note
solo--the second an octave lower than the first--and Coy, suspended
in that empty space, was waiting for the liberating release, the
unique percussion beat, the reverberation of the cymbal and the
drumrolls smoothing the slow, inevitable, amazing path for the
trumpet."</LD>
<TE>   "The Nautical Chart" thus plays rings around its own story of
sunken treasure--a New World cargo so inexplicably important that
Jesuits hoped it would prevent their expulsion from Spain in the
religious intrigues of the 18th century. Pursuing the shipwreck is
the beguiling, mystifying Tanger Soto, a historian at Madrid's Naval
Museum. Pursuing the lovely Ms. Soto is the sailor-without-a-ship,
fish-out-of-water Coy, who is in a melancholy "Conrad" phase of his
life, previously having lived "Melville" and "Stevenson" phases.</TE>
<TE>   Pursuing them both is a professional treasure hunter who won't
quite fit into the villain's stereotype; and lurking in the shadows
is an Argentine dwarf with something up his sleeve. Late in the
story, a first-person narrator unexpectedly steps forth--a
development that furthers the story in less arresting fashion than it
might sound here, owing entirely to Perez-Reverte's command of his
tale and a cracking good translation by Margaret Sayers Peden.</TE>
<TE>   Perez-Reverte, whose four previous novels translated into English
earned him international standing, still does not quite stand on his
own in this country. Almost every mention strives to link him to some
writer of greater renown--a disagreeable habit in publishing, which
serves neither reader nor author. So to clarify, Perez-Reverte is not
the searching moralist of Conrad nor is he the swashbuckler of
Patrick O'Brian. One might stretch and find an echo of Dashiell
Hammett in "The Nautical Chart," if you could imagine Hammett writing
to the beat of jazz.</TE>
<TE>   What these comparisons serve to say, however, is that Perez-
Reverte has written a mystery, but he is not a mystery writer of the
bookseller's genre. Neither is his Coy a stylized mystery character.
He is a sailor--impulsive, lovelorn and bearing the stoicism and
sacrificial gloom of a man whose wake has been crossed by nature's
caprice and no doubt will be again. Soto is the enigma at the core of
this mystery, a daydreamer and a schemer who reveals herself slowly
and never quite entirely. She uses her beauty, and guards against the
advances it invites, manipulatively. She is, in short, just the kind
of doom that a sailor cannot resist, any more than he can resist the
enticement of another voyage and another risk.</TE>
<TE>   A significant, but not overpowering, portion of this book explores
the mysteries of navigation. These passages are not action adventure
but historical adventure. With compass and an ancient atlas, plus old
maritime records and the recorded story of a survivor from the lost
Jesuit brig Dei Gloria, Coy and Soto labor to reconcile the 18th
century understanding of the ocean with the millimeter precision of
modern charting, hoping to fathom the Jesuits' fatal battle with a
corsair and plot the ship's resting place. Sailing, scuba diving,
fist-fighting, hard drinking and a dollop of lovers' passion drive
the story offshore. By today's high-tech standards, this deep-sea
part of the treasure hunt is a rather amateurish affair, but
nonetheless engaging search for the needle in the haystack. And, by
the way, Coy should know better: Wounds do not heal faster at sea.</TE>
<TE>   Again, this is jazz, not hard rock or bubble-gum pop. "The
Nautical Chart" is a sea story--told as a sailor might, off duty on
the deck of his ship. With appreciation for character and detail.
With keen command of pacing and no need to rush. You may have the
same sensation I did: From time to time, I could feel Perez-Reverte
peering out of the pages of his own book. Like any good storyteller,
writer or musician, he makes eye contact to be certain that he's got
hold of you. Because, my friends, down there on the bottom of the
ocean is ... "something too important to hand over without a fight."</TE>

<HD>The Chronicling of a Revolutionary Spirit</HD>
<DH>ANARCHY!: An Anthology of Emma Goldman's Mother Earth,
Edited and with ommentary by Peter Glassgold, Counterpoint: 428 pp.,
$25 paper</DH>

<AU>PAUL BERMAN</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In February 1916, the doughty and notorious anarchist Emma Goldman
was accused of having distributed literature on birth control at a
public meeting in New York, a criminal offense in those dark times.
She was duly summoned to trial. And in her monthly magazine, Mother
Earth, in the April 1916 issue, she took aim at her persecutors.</LD>
<LD>   "We are told," Goldman wrote--the tone is oratorical, haughty,
scornful--"that so long as the law on the statute books makes the
discussion of preventives a crime, these preventives must not be
discussed. In reply I wish to say that it is not the Birth Control
Movement, but the law, which will have to go. After all, that is what
laws are for, to be made and unmade. How dare they demand that life
shall submit to them? Just because some ignorant bigot in his own
limitation of mind and heart succeeded in passing a law at the time
when men and women were in the thralls of religious and moral
superstition, must we be bound by it? I readily understand why judges
and jailers shall be bound by it.... But even judges sometimes
progress."</LD>
<TE>   In the next month's issue, Mother Earth reported that 200 people
attended a banquet in Goldman's honor at the Hotel Brevoort in
Greenwich Village. Five hundred people showed up for the trial.
Goldman rose to the occasion. She said, according to the magazine's
account, that "if it constituted a crime to contend for happier
childhood and healthier motherhood, she was glad and proud to be a
criminal." She was in rhetorical high stride. "The crowd in the
courtroom burst into applause. Excited attendants throve to quell the
clamor." She was sentenced to 15 days in the workhouse, and a guard
dragged her away. The magazine reported, "many of her friends waved
their hands as she was being rushed along, and some stuck their
fingers through the wire grating of the pen runway. She tried to
reach them in farewell as she passed. Her face was alight with
enthusiasm."</TE>
<TE>   Those scenes took place a very long time ago, yet as you read the
account of them in Mother Earth, you pick up a mood that feels modern
in almost every aspect. The sexual controversy, the free speech
issue, the defiant courtroom oration, the question of women's rights,
the cheering crowd, the spirit of civil disobedience, the tone of
exasperated indignation, the martyr's exhilaration lighting Goldman's
triumphant face--every phase of that anarchist episode from 1916
could, with a few variations, come beaming out at us from tonight's
television news.</TE>
<TE>   "Anarchy!," edited by Peter Glassgold, is a compilation of
articles from the entire run of Mother Earth, 1906 to 1918, and a
great virtue of the book is to reveal how many of the customs and
controversies of our present-day "culture wars" got their start in
the little world around Goldman and her small-circulation magazine
and the radical public in New York's Greenwich Village in those
years. Mother Earth was, in other ways, hopelessly old-fashioned.
Glassgold has reprinted a number of articles laying out Goldman's
anarchist doctrine and its main theses: the coming proletarian
revolution, the abolition of the state and the establishing of a free
society of liberated individuals--a utopian dogma with several
attractive features.</TE>
<TE>   But the doctrine, once you have read two or three expositions of
it, begins to seem like one of those sci-fi fantasies from the 19th
century in which the spaceship is made of wood and the captain steers
with a tiller. The anthology includes an enthusiastic account of
Goldman by the celebrated poetry editor, Margaret Anderson (whose own
publication from those years, the Little Review, promoted literary
modernism), yet even Anderson seems to have had her reservations. She
wrote, "Emma Goldman's genius is not so much that she is a great
thinker as that she is a great woman"--which is to say, even the
keenest of Goldman's fans sometimes could grow weary of her ideas.</TE>
<TE>   Some of those ideas can make you worry. Goldman's followers and
fellow-thinkers in the anarchist movement stood on the far,
intransigent wing of the American left of that time and were widely
regarded as all too prone to throw bombs or kill people on behalf of
the revolutionary cause. Glassgold, in his introduction to
"Anarchy!," assures us that anarchism's violent fame was undeserved.
"Revolutionary violence," he says, was "a minor question within the
movement that nevertheless dogged its reputation and alarmed its
opponents on the political right as well as the left, beyond
measure." But his own selection of articles from the magazine makes
the minor question look major.</TE>
<TE>   One writer after another in this anthology finds some way to
justify a bit of bomb-throwing. The most exotic of those writers,
Voltairine de Cleyre, was a prose stylist in a florid Emersonian
mode, the author of a famous essay in the January 1908 issue called
"They Who Marry Do Ill." (Marriage, said de Cleyre, "stales love,
brings respect into contempt, outrages all the proprieties, and
limits the growth of both parties.") She was a poet, too--though her
poems, as a shrewd critic observed in the magazine, "are almost
without exception poems of vengeance.... They are crimson and black;
they quiver with hatred." And, in the quivering vein, De Cleyre
wrote, in regard to the assassin of President William McKinley, "The
hells of capitalism create the desperate; the desperate
act--desperately!" That is a fine-sounding statement, and even finer
for being italicized. But its meaning is: The assassin was not to
blame.</TE>
<TE>   Goldman was the publisher and chief celebrity of Mother Earth, but
the magazine's editor for most of its run was Alexander Berkman, who,
before taking up the editorship, had spent 14 years in the Pittsburgh
penitentiary for having tried to kill the tyrannical steel baron
Henry Clay Frick. In his own crimson and black moods, Berkman liked
to rattle off terrifying phrases, just to put the fear of God in the
robber barons: "The bomb is the echo of your cannon, trained upon our
starving brothers; it is the cry of the wounded striker."</TE>
<TE>   There was something dishonest in those arguments--the claim that
other people, the capitalist class, were to blame for terrorist
attacks, when it was, in fact, the anarchists. In 1914, three
anarchists blew themselves up on Lexington Avenue in New York,
preparing a bomb that was evidently intended for another industrial
despot of the day, John D. Rockefeller. Berkman published a series of
sympathetic articles about the victims in Mother Earth--which Goldman
claimed not to be happy about. Yet, according to the principal
historian of American anarchism, Paul Avrich, Berkman may have been
involved in helping to organize or even leading the little group that
built the Lexington Avenue bomb.</TE>
<TE>   Mother Earth had its literary side too, which tended to be at its
best when joined to the libertarian spirit. A poem by a reporter
named Don Marquis made fun of Anthony Comstock, the Kenneth Starr of
his time:</TE>
<TE>   What, Aphrodite!</TE>
<TE>   Not even a nightie</TE>
<TE>   Between you and Hades, my dear?</TE>
<TE>   But tragedy, not humor, was the dominant note. World War I broke
out, and Goldman and Berkman were characteristically fiery in their
efforts to keep America from entering. Their antiwar position got the
magazine officially suppressed, on the grounds of the extremely
repressive Espionage Act of 1917. Goldman and Berkman were jailed for
agitating against the military draft and then were deported, both of
them, to the brand-new Soviet Union.</TE>
<TE>   What happened next falls outside the scope of Glassgold's
anthology, since Mother Earth was dead and unrevivable. But the years
that followed were intensely dramatic. Goldman and Berkman, invoking
their revolutionary prestige, tried to convince the Bolshevik leaders
not to create a dictatorship in Russia. And when their persuasions
failed, the two anarchists launched a vast campaign to convince
liberals and left-wingers around the world of the dangers of Soviet
Communism--a lonely campaign, conducted under the most frightening
conditions of political isolation and physical exile in Germany,
France, Britain and Canada; a noble campaign, and prophetic, as
everybody can see today. That was their finest hour.</TE>
<TE>   I put down Glassgold's anthology filled with regard for the
bravery of Goldman and Berkman and their comrades, for the many good
things they did, and for their libertarian and rebellious spirit; and
dismayed by the foolish things they had done and countenanced. Most
of all, I put down the anthology feeling that 99 out of 100 magazines
could disappear off the face of the Earth, with nothing but benefit
for the trees; but Mother Earth was that 100th magazine. It was a
magazine created by personalities so prickly and strong that even
now, almost a century later, you feel their pressure as if a hand is
squeezing your hand, pressing arguments onto you that are variously
right and wrong (as we are likely to think today) but are
incontestably those of living, breathing people.</TE>

<HD>Inside the House of the Rising Sun</HD>
<DH>DON'T LET ME BE MISUNDERSTOOD, By Eric Burdon with J.
Marshall Craig, Thunder's Mouth Press: 326 pp., $24.95</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PAULA FRIEDMAN</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In 1968, shortly after "We Gotta Get Out of This Place" had topped
the American charts, Eric Burdon was waiting for a flight at the
Atlanta airport when he was approached by two Marines who said to
him, "Thanks for the music, man. It helped. It really helped." Years
later, when leaving the stage of a Long Island club, a soft-spoken
man approached him, a Vietnam vet who lingered after the show to tell
Burdon an amazing story about a night when he was stationed at a
secret base in Cambodia: "'One of the men had a small Spanish
guitar,' he told me. 'It was Christmas night. The stars were out, and
the jungle was beginning to come alive, as it always does at night.
He started playing "House of the Rising Sun" on the guitar. We were
barely into the first verse when the whole lush mountain seemed to
come alive in song--even some of the Vietcong on the opposite side of
the hill joined in.'"</LD>
<LD>   Not many rock 'n' roll stars can recount anecdotes that so
dramatically reflect the urgent role their music has filled. After
all, Burdon's hallmark tune had at least momentarily united
archenemies engaged in one of the most brutal of wars.</LD>
<TE>   Born in 1940 in the grimly poor town of Newcastle in northern
England, Burdon began playing jazz--his first love before the
blues--in such local clubs as Downbeat and the Rex Hotel, where he
often sat in with Mighty Joe Young's jazz band. One night when Burdon
and his buddies were hanging around at the Downbeat after playing,
they decided to put their own band together, and it wouldn't be long
before Eric Burdon and the Animals would hit the stage.</TE>
<TE>   By 1963, they had a growing reputation as a rhythm &amp; blues band
and were asked to accompany Sonny Boy Williamson on a New Year's
show. That same year, Burdon was contacted by talent scout Peter
Grant and told he and his band had been chosen for Chuck Berry's
British tour (beating out the Yardbirds and the Rolling Stones).
Record producer Mickie Most quickly latched hold of the band that had
the "rawest" sound of any he worked with. But as Burdon tells it,
conflicts soon arose, first over whether or not the band should even
record "House of the Rising Sun," with Most and the Animals' manager,
Mike Jeffery, convinced it would amount to nothing but a waste of
money.</TE>
<TE>   Burdon and the band fiercely disagreed, for the reception the song
received when they performed it on the Berry tour assured them that
they had the right tune and the right delivery. With its roots in a
17th century British folk melody, the song had circulated among
musicians in the American South, and was first recorded by black
bluesman Texas Alexander in 1928.</TE>
<TE>   Although it had been recorded acoustically in the early '60s by
the likes of Bob Dylan and Woody Guthrie, "House of the Rising Sun"
didn't climb the charts until the Animals played it electric in 1964.</TE>
<TE>   But conflicts continued to brew among band members and between the
musicians and their manager, who Burdon came to believe was a
complete scoundrel who mismanaged their business dealings. In fact,
the money made from their first albums seemed to vanish into thin
air, a pattern that would plague Burdon and his many bands to follow.</TE>
<TE>   In this instance, the Bahamian bank where Jeffery invested the
Animals' earnings actually did disappear, building and all.
Throughout his autobiography, Burdon makes no bones about his lack of
business smarts, insisting that the music and touring were his true
passions. After breaking up in the late '60s, the Animals were soon
replaced by the New Animals and then a scant few years later by Eric
Burdon and War. And while these, and many of his later bands produced
fine music, even hits, none seemed to possess the utter magnetic
power of the original Animals.</TE>
<TE>   Burdon also discusses his relationships with other musicians of
the era, most notably Jimi Hendrix, a close friend until the guitar
genius died of a drug overdose in 1970. Among other '60s
debacles--most of which concerned some kind of drug abuse or
another--he includes Hendrix's death as a key sign that an era was
ending. Though Burdon was married twice, he regretfully acknowledges
that enduring relationships with women were not his strong suit. Yet,
despite the many losses, Burdon remains fiercely proud of his
accomplishments, and his sustained passion for music and for
traveling, including extended stays on the Spanish islands of Majorca
and Minorca and tours of Israel's Negev and Bosnia, keep him looking
enthusiastically toward the future.</TE>
<TE>   Readers may find Burdon a bit scant on insight into some of his
important personal relationships, but his perspective on the business
end of 1960s rock 'n' roll--and his own place within it--proves
riveting and informative.</TE>

<DH>THE NOONDAY DEMON: An Atlas of Depression, By Andrew Solomon,
Scribner: 570 pp., $28; THE ANATOMY OF MELANCHOLY:, By Robert
Burton, New York Review of Books: 548 pp., $22.95</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PATRICK GILES</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>   Around the time Andrew Solomon's essay on depression, "Anatomy of
Melancholy," appeared in the New Yorker, a neighbor jumped from the
roof of my apartment building. All that winter afternoon, policemen
came and went with a loud offhandedness; suicide is part of their
job, after all. Today, I read "The Noonday Demon"--the book that grew
from that magazine essay--haunted by that neighbor I saw but never
spoke to, another example of the grief of being that drives so many
to death, and so many others to hide from it, fight it, attempt to
cure it--or write about it.</LD>
<LD>   Solomon's book quickly became a bestseller; last fall, it was
honored with the National Book Award for nonfiction. Writing "The
Noonday Demon" (the title comes from the 90th Psalm) became, for him,
a way of reaching out to his fellow depressives and to the
undepressed. In every chapter, our guide remains close. The horror of
his personal ordeal (days spent in bed too despairing to move) should
be enough to make any reader understand why he writes of himself so
incessantly.</LD>
<TE>   But "The Noonday Demon" is not content to remain a personal study:
It's also the most ambitious recent book about a subject that has
long been ceded to psychiatrists and social workers. Solomon even
encroaches on their territory, skillfully interpreting medical texts
and studies. He evaluates treatments, from new pharmaceuticals to
older methods like shock treatment, as well as New Age alternative
approaches.</TE>
<TE>   Solomon is sometimes too willing to trust the medical and
pharmaceutical professions. He discloses that his father's company
(Forest Laboratories) is the American distributor of Celexa, one of
several antidepressants Solomon takes. But Solomon never fully
focuses on the underside of treatments--the miserable side effects
and misprescriptions of medications; the terrible powerlessness the
depressed often feel at the hands of health care workers--and his
sunniness can get irritating. "Take your pills," he advises his
depressed readers.</TE>
<TE>   "The Noonday Demon" is on the whole a generous, intelligent,
worthy study, not only ranging through hundreds of books and
thousands of years of history, but exploring geographical worlds of
depression: visiting Iceland, where the depressed must live for long
periods without sunlight, and Cambodia, where women survivors of
genocide receive beauty-parlor cossettings and a recipe of
"forgetting, working, and loving."</TE>
<TE>   Yet why is it that Solomon never truly explores the site where
depression has expressed itself most completely, provided sanctuary,
enlightenment or at least occupation for its sufferers and benefits
for succeeding generations--in literature? What we now call
depression has an older, richer name, "melancholy" (from the Greek
melaina kole, "black bile," perhaps first written about by
Aristotle). So frequently present in the lives of artists that its
absence is often more notable than its appearance, melancholy is most
powerfully put to work in art and most fully communicated there.
There is something about melancholy that, under the proper nurturing
circumstances, all but bounds into imaginative expression, despite
the agony it wreaks on its creators. ("They could not help it if
their laments sounded so beautiful," Franz Kafka once wrote about the
sirens whose singing lured sailors to their deaths.) This is a
literature not of madness, but of supreme lucidity, a covert
tradition that dares to state the highest truths of existence from
the deepest afflictions of sorrow: Call it the literature of
consolation and courage.</TE>
<TE>   In "The Noonday Demon" Solomon often quotes literature, but
usually in support of his own opinions or when summarizing a
historical school or period (not always fairly). Yet a less
constricted search into the figures and landmarks of the kingdom of
words leads one to discover melancholy in every age, every form,
gliding within the shadow of many characters, empowering growing
piles of plays and novels, animating rhythms of countless poems. What
greater solace or community might there be? Following the reign of
Hamlet, Prince of Denmark, King of Melancholics, 17th century England
(to start in the middle of the journey) was the summit of melancholy
creation. John Donne's poetry and his fierce argument over the
efficacy of suicide compete in plangency with the prose masterwork of
the heavy-hearted, Robert Burton's "The Anatomy of Melancholy."
Solomon gives this book far too little homage: It is in fact a
staggering triumph of education and artistry, at once a treatise on
the medical, historical, philosophical and spiritual aspects of
melancholy, a pep talk for fellow sufferers and a meta-fictional
challenge leagues more daunting than any Melville or Thomas Pynchon
crafted centuries later.</TE>
<TE>   The depressive torrent continued through the Romantic age:
Wordsworth and Shelley and Byron and Blake, Keats' "Ode on
Melancholy," Dickens' Miss Havisham (among many others), the Brontes'
sisterly misery in life and letters, advancing to American
literature's new continent of literary guilt and despair, from the
New England metaphysicalism of Emily Dickinson to the Post Modern
digressiveness of David Foster Wallace.</TE>
<TE>   Why has melancholy revealed itself so outspokenly, so
passionately, in literature? Perhaps because it allows readers and
creators afflicted by life to send and receive messages to and from
each other. Direct social speech about such suffering was seldom
possible. The information of melancholy, its irrefutable faith in
despair, could, when translated by imagination, be made bearable to
the reader (and the culture) by beauty and the belief its message was
only "fictional." Long suspected the work of the devil, or (at least)
a social malignity, or (today) a pathology, depression in poetry, in
drama, in narrative, in allegory, in metaphor, could be shared
completely, without prohibition. And when melancholy overwhelmed
words, song stepped in: In "The Plaint," from Henry Purcell's baroque
opera "The Fairy Queen," the singer sighs a few moribund phrases,
"Ah, let me weep, forever weep!", passing repeatedly into silence;
the violin takes over, its variations flooded with additional
sorrows. Back and forth voice and violin go, until there is simply no
more to say, play, or feel.</TE>
<TE>   Such excess is characteristic of melancholic creation, which
usually occurs post-prostration: Coleridge gratefully regains his
powers of composition, Charlotte Bronte repairs to her writing desk,
Virginia Woolf to her diaries, essays, novels. But many sufferers
also experience appalling eruptions of their depressions into
disobedient speech, and there are instances when "the shadow mouth"
(Andre Breton) directly strikes at literature. Two examples familiar
to readers are Edgar Allan Poe and Sylvia Plath. The ghastly
claustrophobia of an ultimate, terrible meaning permeating Poe's most
sinister work bears the howl of the melancholic at his most
unendurable. The defiant relish and fateful candor in Plath's final
poems probably accounts for her still-scandalous reputation.</TE>
<TE>   It is not only Solomon who misses the potent wisdom of melancholy
literature: Our entire culture flees from it. Many critics and
artists today dismiss or even ridicule any notion of the therapeutic,
even redemptive potential of art. I am not suggesting healing and
enrichment are literature's only values. But to claim that pages full
of melancholic wisdom shouldn't console, inform, even inspire readers
to take action (in addition to being works of the highest quality) is
to miss a fundamental reason literature exists, and has always and
should still exist. Underestimating or belittling its nourishing,
even transfiguring powers is a major reason literature plays so
diminished a role in the culture today. Literature as a formal or
critical object, or as a mere commodity, is a literature not worth a
damn.</TE>
<TE>   If we can come to revalue melancholy's place in literature, we can
do the same for melancholy itself. I am not suggesting we turn away
from the true and horrible suffering that creators (and others)
endure on its account; many more have perished since the day my
neighbor jumped from our roof, and more always will. Honoring
melancholy means attending to its uncomfortable truth, a truth the
literature of melancholy more than demonstrates its bearers and
hearers must possess, even if it's one they would prefer never to
know. Some of its sufferers view melancholy not as the final
abandonment of hope but as the forging-place of a hope that can
withstand the worst the world can hurl at it. (Hope is the last
spirit left in the box Pandora opened, and it pleads to be let out,
not for its own sake, but for the world's.) The literature of
melancholy reminds us that the depressed exist in part to give us
reasons to live we must hear--and frequently can only hear--from
their doubting, bitter, yet perpetually reimagining and enduring
voices.</TE>

<LD>   The gene is hot stuff these days. Long before the first draft of
the human genome was published last winter and thrust us into the Age
of the Genome, the gene has been used to explain a whole raft of
human facts of life: susceptibility to malaria or AIDS; traits like
adventurousness and shyness; homosexuality; obesity; the inexplicable
competing urges toward fidelity and straying.</LD>
<LD>   Now come two books by two of the most highly regarded science
writers in England, both eager to add their voices to the
international paean to the double helix. (And this doesn't even count
the recently published "Life Script" by Nicholas Wade or "Dinner at
the New Gene Cafe" by Bill Lambrecht.) Each has taken a familiar
biological argument and recast it, with differing degrees of success,
entirely in terms of the gene.</LD>
<TE>   In the first, Colin Tudge, author of such notable books as "The
Variety of Life" and "The Second Creation," offers a concise history
of the early days of genetics that culminates in a defense of the
controversial field of evolutionary psychology (the newer,
less-inflammatory term for "sociobiology," which caused an uproar
when introduced by Harvard zoologist E.O. Wilson a generation ago and
was immediately branded racist, reductionist and evocative of all the
worst notions of eugenics and the quest for genetic purity). "The
Impact of the Gene" thus becomes two books, one about the past and
one about the present, with the gene providing explanatory power for
a contemporary field that Tudge practically takes on faith.</TE>
<TE>   In the second book, Mark Ridley (no relation to his countryman and
fellow science writer Matt Ridley, author of the wildly popular
"Genome"), a professor of zoology at Oxford, argues that the
evolution of complex animals was by no means inevitable, is in fact
counterintuitive and can best be understood in terms of the
four-letter code of DNA. He borrows his title, "The Cooperative
Gene," from the idea of a "selfish gene" first propounded by Richard
Dawkins, who made the case that not only is a chicken merely an egg's
way of making another egg (a phrase usually attributed to Samuel
Butler), but that all of us, no matter how complex or talented or
beloved, are merely DNA's way of making more DNA.</TE>
<TE>   "If the business of life is to copy genes," Ridley writes, "most
of our physiology suggests a loss of focus during evolution." By this
he means not that Dawkins is wrong, but that the "selfish gene" idea
is insufficient to explain how life evolved from simple, one-celled
beings to the complex, highly organized living systems that walk on,
swim under or fly above the Earth.</TE>
<TE>   "The evolution of complex life required a mechanism of inheritance
with an inherently random component," Ridley writes. "Somewhere
between the bacteria and us--perhaps at about the stage of simple
worms--God did have to start to play dice." So he creates a little
mascot, "Mendel's demon," to help explain the rules of that celestial
crapshoot. Calling it "Mendel's demon" is, of course, Ridley's nod to
Gregor Mendel, the so-called father of genetics, because Mendel
recognized that the units of heredity are randomly reshuffled every
time a new generation is created.</TE>
<TE>   The theorized behavior of "Mendel's demon," however, isn't demonic
in the least. According to Ridley, it's "a law-enforcing kind of
demon. It redirects the laws of biology to a more creative, rather
than destructive, direction." In effect, it imposes order on a
chaotic process, taking the form, ultimately, of increasing
complexity.</TE>
<TE>   Ridley focuses his argument about the evolution of complexity on a
few crucial points: copying errors in the transcription of DNA and
how they are passed on; natural selection and how it acts on
offspring with genetic mistakes; and the evolution of sex. But
despite Ridley's lighthearted touch, reading his book can be pretty
tough going.</TE>
<TE>   "The Impact of the Gene" is easier to read. The first half is a
quick overview of the history of genetics, devoted primarily to
retelling the little that's known about Mendel, a Moravian monk who
spent seven years conducting research on inheritance patterns in pea
plants, presented his results in a two-part lecture in 1865 and was
promptly forgotten. Mendel died in 1884 thinking his conclusions
about inheritance must have been wrong--but it turned out he was
merely ahead of his time.</TE>
<TE>   In 1900, his original paper was rediscovered, and scientists had
amassed sufficient insight by this time to see it for what it was: a
brilliant and clear demonstration of the existence of discrete units
of heredity, which within a few years would be known as genes.</TE>
<TE>   Tudge tells this story in clear if sometimes plodding prose,
hewing throughout to the interpretation of a single Mendel
biographer, a geneticist from the town of Brno now in the Czech
Republic, where Mendel's monastery still stands. Tudge presents his
hero as a genius on the order of Galileo, Newton and Darwin; "his
experiments with peas," he writes, "were beautifully designed,
wonderfully modern in concept, and rooted in a deep understanding of
the problems--problems that now seem difficult to envision largely
because Mendel solved them."</TE>
<TE>   Unfortunately, what's missing here is a sense of the lively debate
that's been going on for nearly a century about just how much of a
genius Mendel really was, and whether he deserves to be known as the
father of genetics. The details of Mendel's life are in many ways a
mystery, since he left behind few papers. But Tudge chooses to fill
in the blanks in sometimes perplexing ways. He insists, for instance,
that Mendel was a "confidant" of some of the most notable figures in
European science of his day, a man who was "indeed well connected"
and "close to the action." In my own view, Mendel was an outsider,
isolated by language, geography, background and temperament, which is
what made it so hard for him to get a hearing for his
discovery--especially because it went against the conventional wisdom
that heredity was the "blending" of maternal and paternal traits.</TE>
<TE>   Tudge's book is plagued by anachronisms, such as when he says that
Charles Darwin noted a "Mendelian ratio" in certain family
trees--even though Darwin had never heard of Mendel. It's plagued by
repetition, too, like his frequent assertions of what makes an
experiment "elegant" or who really coined the phrase "survival of the
fittest" (hint: it wasn't Darwin). It's almost as if Tudge doesn't
expect his readers to be paying attention.</TE>
<TE>   In "The Impact of the Gene" and "The Cooperative Gene," the final
chapters are devoted to a bit of free-form speculation about what our
evolving knowledge about genetics implies for the future, or for a
new interpretation of the present. For Tudge, the whole point of
telling his tale seems to be to make a case for evolutionary
psychology. He spends a lot of time defending some premises that 30
years ago caused a great howl from the political left protesting what
it interpreted as genetic determinism: that genes underlie much human
behavior, that even acts of altruism and self-sacrifice can be
ascribed to the "selfish gene," that we behave the way we do because
it was adaptive at one time in our species' history and that
different behavioral strategies can be quantified, measured and
compared.</TE>
<TE>   His discussion of these four premises is clear and interesting but
marred by the chip on his shoulder that he reveals in the very first
chapter of "The Impact of the Gene," in which he alludes to the
highly politicized nature of these arguments in the heyday of
sociobiology. "The vociferous critics of evolutionary psychology
should do some homework," he writes, "to find out what it is really
about. If they did, they would surely be ashamed of their own
obduracy."</TE>
<TE>   As for Ridley, his speculative chapters are more fun and less
defensive. In his view, the only thing that has kept humans from
evolving to an even more complex life form is the genetic mutation
rate. The complexity of a species is the result of an evolutionary
equilibrium between the mutation rate (which increases as the number
of genes increases) on the one hand, and correcting mechanisms like
proofreading enzymes and sexual reproduction on the other.</TE>
<TE>   If the mutation rate can be reduced--by routinely freezing young
girls' error-free eggs for use later when they're ready to reproduce,
for example, or by using gene therapy to correct those mutations that
do slip by through gene therapy--then the sky's the limit in terms of
life's complexity.</TE>
<TE>   Ridley imagines a future in which the human species contains
within its DNA codes for other organisms that are held in reserve, to
be "called up as appropriate." If earthly conditions change, through
nuclear winter or a denuded ozone layer or "fire and brimstone," then
a whole new species, descendants of humans but no longer humanoid,
can "reinvent themselves as fire-adapted flowers and cover the
scorched earth with fresh foliage. After the deluge, they will grow
up as fish, and swim safely beneath the waves. And when the last
trump sounds, they will express the genes for sinlessness, and their
ten-thousand-million-gene vessels of cooperating and error-conquering
DNA will glide down the rivers of Paradise into eternity."</TE>
<TE>   This is a grandly optimistic view of the post-apocalypse, one that
the author might not even believe now in light of the events of
recent months, but for the moment it is one from which to take a
certain measure of comfort. Should "the deluge" come, it may take a
few billion years before life on Earth reemerges, but reemerge it
will. And it will do so, as it did before, with a staggering degree
of ingenuity, variety and sophistication.</TE>

<LD>GIANTS IN THE EARTH: The California Redwoods, Edited by Peter Johnstone,
Heyday Books:  384 pp., $18 paper</LD>
<LD>   "The big tree," as the California redwood is sometimes called, can
be inspiring for some, unsettling to others, even terrifying to a
few. "Magical" is how biologist Verna R. Johnston describes a redwood
grove at dawn; a "dismal forest prison" is how explorer L.K. Wood
describes the redwoods of Humboldt County; and the Yurok people of
northwestern California regarded the redwoods as the physical
incarnation chosen by spirits at the very beginning of time--if
wounded, they believed, a redwood would bleed.</LD>
<LD>   All of these qualities are explored in "Giants in the Earth," a
well-chosen and provocative anthology of poetry and prose that shows
how the redwood has impressed itself on the human imagination over
the last 200 years or so. The usual suspects are here, of course,
ranging from John Muir to Robinson Jeffers to Gary Snyder, along with
several generations of explorers and environmental activists,
naturalists and nature poets. But there are some surprises too,
including extracts from the work of Arthur Conan Doyle, Tom Wolfe,
Czeslaw Milosz and Armistead Maupin, all touching on the subject of
the redwoods.</LD>
<TE>   "The history of writing about redwoods might ... be viewed as a
quixotic effort, a noble and sometimes pathetic attempt to recover
some sense of human proportion and meaning," explains Peter
Johnstone, editor of the anthology, "which, along with the gift of
speech, the godlike plant has stolen from mortals who dare to measure
its breadth and length."</TE>
<TE>   Twenty-five million years ago, we are told in "Giants in the
Earth," redwoods stretched across all of the northern hemisphere.
Today, only two varieties remain--the Sequoiadendron giganteum of the
southern Sierra Nevada, and the Sequoia sempervirens,  whose range is
limited to the Pacific coast, all but eight miles of which is located
within Northern California. And the best explanation for their
powerful appeal is found in the superlatives that have attached
themselves to the California redwoods.</TE>
<TE>   The redwoods of the Sierra are the tallest trees in the world,
reaching a height of more than 360 feet, and the coastal redwoods are
the widest in circumference; a portfolio of historic photographs
selected by Peter E. Palmquist makes the point. And, famously, some
redwoods are more than 1,000 years old, a fact that figures memorably
in both ranger talks in our Western parks and in a crucial scene from
"Vertigo," in which Kim Novak shows Jimmy Stewart the span of her
prior life on an ancient tree's exposed rings.</TE>
<TE>   "While forty, perhaps fifty generations of humans lived and loved
and fought and died," muses essayist Francois Leydet about one of the
oldest redwoods, "this tree always stood in this very place, aloof
and mindless of human antics."</TE>
<TE>   Significantly, the redwoods did not (and do not) always inspire
reverence--the first Europeans to encounter the big trees saw them as
a commodity, and so do the loggers of our own times. That's why Julia
Butterfly Hill climbed to the top of a 1,000-year-old redwood and
stayed there for two years--but her exploit was not merely an act of
eco-activism. "People no longer had any power over me," writes this
latter-day anchorite about the revelation she experienced atop the
big tree. "I was going to live my life guided from the higher source,
the Creation source."</TE>
<TE>   Hill's manifesto is an example of what Johnstone characterizes as
the "apocalypticism" and "anti-humanism" that can be found in the
latest writing on the redwoods, a sense of "unease, pessimism, or
panic on the issue of the rapidly disappearing redwood forests." Not
every contributor to "Giants in the Earth" is quite so strident, of
course, but virtually all of them--the scientists and historians no
less than the poets and special pleaders--are inspired to express
themselves in language that owes more to metaphysics than politics,
economics or natural history.</TE>
<TE>   Annie Montague Alexander is best remembered, when she is
remembered at all, as the heiress who endowed museums of zoology and
paleontology on the UC Berkeley campus in the early years of the 20th
century. But Barbara Stein, author of "On Her Own Terms," is intent
on rescuing Alexander from such obscurity and presenting her to the
world as nothing less than a feminist icon.</TE>
<TE>   "She was an intrepid explorer, world traveler, amateur naturalist,
farmer, philanthropist and founder and patron of two natural history
museums, all at a time when women did not have the right to vote and
few had any involvement in the world outside their homes," writes
Stein. "She was a woman of vision who loved women and believed firmly
in their capabilities. She lived passionately and, perhaps most
importantly, she dealt with the world on her own terms."</TE>
<TE>   Born in 1867 to a wealthy sugar planter in Hawaii, Alexander moved
with her family to Oakland when she was a teenager. Accustomed to the
freedom and adventure of life in 19th century Maui, Stein insists,
Alexander found life on the mainland to be "oppressive"--she was sent
to a finishing school where gloves were required and bloomers were
forbidden; she struggled with migraines and eyestrain so severe that
it threatened blindness; and she was so discouraged by her early
efforts at art that she destroyed all of her paintings and drawings.</TE>
<TE>   But Alexander insisted on reinventing herself, starting in 1899
with a 10-week horseback trek through Northern and Southern
California in the company of a young woman named Martha Beckwith, the
first of several women in whom she recognized a "kindred spirit." She
began to audit paleontology courses at UC Berkeley, and she saw
fieldwork as an opportunity to escape from the empty tedium of life
as a rich man's unmarried daughter in turn-of-the-century America. By
the end of her life, she had collected thousands of specimens of
flora, fauna and fossils throughout North America.</TE>
<TE>   "Perhaps if I had a husband and family I should not be running
after strange gods," she confided to one of her kindred spirits. "I
do not want to be selfish yet it seems to me we have the right to a
considerable extent of disposing of our lives as we think fit."</TE>
<TE>   Stein deals frankly, if also compassionately, with Alexander's
sexual orientation and, in particular, the lifelong relationship with
her "partner," Louise Kellogg. "[S]he was a lesbian," one of
Alexander's colleagues told Stein, "[b]ut we didn't talk about such
things in those days." In fact, hardly a single word in the
correspondence between Alexander and Kellogg--or, even more
remarkably, the private journal that they jointly kept throughout
their years together--betrays the secret of the love they shared for
some 40 years.</TE>
<TE>   "If the object of such discretion was to protect their families,
or protect themselves from their families, then perhaps they
succeeded," writes Stein, "as neither set of relatives ever suggested
that their relationship was anything more than that of close
friends."</TE>
<TE>   One of the telling facts revealed by Stein is that Alexander was
the financial sponsor of the scientific expeditions that she
accompanied into the field. The thought occurs that her achievements
would have been even more extraordinary if she had achieved them with
only ordinary means. But it's also true that when Alexander writes of
what it takes to succeed at fieldwork--"pure grit, pluck, dogged
perseverance"--she is describing her own gifts, too.</TE>

<DH>GAVIN LAMBERT MARLENE DIETRICH: Photographs and Memories Compiled by

<LD>   "From the sequins of 'The Blue Angel' to the dinner jacket of
'Morocco,'" Jean Cocteau wrote in 1954, "from the shabby black dress
of 'Dishonored' to the peacock feathers of 'Shanghai Express,' from
the diamonds of 'Desire' to the American uniform, there comes to us
... [a] legend, a wonder: Marlene Dietrich."</LD>
<LD>   Other admirers quoted in "Marlene Dietrich: Photographs and
Memories," which is an extraordinary book about an extraordinary
subject, include Josef von Sternberg (who notes her mood swings from
"severe depression" to "unbelievable vigor"), Orson Welles (who
believes her scenes in "Touch of Evil" are "as good as anything I've
ever done"), Kenneth Tynan ("She has sex but no particular gender")
and Ernest Hemingway ("If she had nothing more than her voice, she
could break your heart with it").</LD>
<TE>   Compiled from hundreds of items in the Dietrich Collection in the
Filmmuseum Berlin, many published for the first time, the book also
records her lovers of both sexes in photographs and letters. Heading
the list are Von Sternberg, Jean Gabin, Erich Maria Remarque,
Mercedes de Acosta, Maurice Chevalier, Edith Piaf, Yul Brynner and
Joe Carstairs, a cross-dressing Standard Oil heiress who once held
the world record as the fastest female speedboat racer.</TE>
<TE>   The letters reveal the often desperate passions that Dietrich
aroused, but with a performer, it's the pictures (289 of them, all
handsomely reproduced in black-and-white and color) that tell the
most dramatic stories. The first of the five sections, "Portraits,"
begins with Dietrich in Berlin, 1927. She hasn't yet found the "look"
that director Von Sternberg will guide her toward in "The Blue Angel"
(1930). Only six months later, "Morocco" brings it to near perfection
and celebrates the bisexuality that always intrigued her mentor. And
more than 20 years later (when she was 53), two portraits by Richard
Avedon show her in full, sublimely ambiguous command.</TE>
<TE>   The color images of "Beads, Furs and Feathers" focus on
performance gowns and accessories. A sequined dress with an
ostrich-feather train and the black tails she favored over white
(which "reminded her of Liberace"), reflect the same ambiguity. It's
reflected again in "Possessions," a Festschrift of offstage costumes
and gifts including a Schiaparelli blue silk lounge suit and the
pistols that Gen. George Patton gave her.</TE>
<TE>   "At Work" begins with images from Dietrich's silent movies, covers
the Von Sternberg era and illustrates some equally remarkable later
performances in "Destry Rides Again," "A Foreign Affair," "Touch of
Evil" and "Judgment at Nuremberg." It ends with Dietrich as the stage
virtuoso who toured a one-woman show--in see-through costumes--around
half the world from 1954 to 1975 (when she was 74).</TE>
<TE>   But equal visual time is rightly given to the Dietrich of World
War II, who sang and played her musical saw to thousands of
spellbound GIs behind the battle lines, who assisted refugees,
accompanied Patton's Third Army on its advance to the Siegfried Line
and entered Berlin wearing her Eisenhower jacket with a Jump Master
pin from the 82nd Airborne Division on one lapel and a badge from the
Soviet Elite Guard on the other.</TE>
<TE>   The book ends before Dietrich, crippled by Buerger's disease,
withdraws to cranky seclusion. Partly, no doubt, because it's a
tribute, not a biography; but in any case, there are no images of
those last years. And the essential Marlene, richly exhibited
throughout "Photographs and Memories," also makes a brief but telling
appearance in the typewritten draft of an article she wrote titled
"Artists."</TE>
<TE>   When she notes that "all their reactions go to extremes," it's an
acute autobiographical comment from someone so self-involved and so
generous, so self-deprecating and yet such a tireless keeper of her
own flame, and from an equally tireless sexual adventurer who was
never really interested in the sexual act, but obsessed with the
romantic notion of "love" and with proving that age didn't lessen her
powers of attraction.</TE>
<TE>   While I was visiting her in her dressing room after "An Evening
With Marlene Dietrich" at the Ahmanson Theatre in 1958, a reporter
from Time magazine asked for an interview for inclusion "in the
'People' section." Rebuffing him with a subtly inflected disdain,
Marlene spoke her own epitaph. "'People?,'" she said. "'People?' I am
not 'People!'"</TE>

<DH>EVERY TONGUE GOT TO CONFESS: Negro Folktales from the Gulf

<DL></DL>
<LD>Since her lonely death in 1960, Zora Neale Hurston has risen to be
enshrined in the literary pantheon. Her novel "Their Eyes Were
Watching God" (1937) holds a deservedly prominent place in the
African American and feminist literary canon and is taught widely at
colleges and universities across the country. So widely, in fact,
that it is of considerable interest that an unpublished manuscript of
Hurston's has now come to light.</LD>
<LD>   The manuscript of "Every Tongue Got to Confess" languished for 30
years in "a basement storage room at Columbia University," explains
the volume's editor Carla Kaplan, and for another 20 years at the
Smithsonian. The book's great value for us today is in the way it
returns us to Hurston's literary and academic roots as a folklorist
and anthropologist and to the people and material which inspired and
enriched her fiction.</LD>
<LD>   From her birth in 1891 in Notasulga, Ala., and childhood in
Eatonville, Fla., the first incorporated black town in the United
States, Hurston grew up valuing the music and rhythms of black speech
as well as the folk tales and songs that would be central in her
writing career.</LD>
<TE>   Hurston entered Howard University in 1920 and, within a year, had
a story published in the school's literary magazine. In 1925 a story
was published by Opportunity, a New York black literary magazine
important in that coalescing of writers and artists that would come
to be known as the Harlem Renaissance. Hurston moved to New York and
soon became friends with Langston Hughes, Arna Bontemps and the
artist Aaron Douglas, among others. (I minored in art at Fisk
University in the late 1950s where Douglas was chairman of the art
department. He remembered Hurston with fondness and would chuckle
recalling her flamboyance and her ability to amuse everyone with her
"down-home" stories.)</TE>
<TE>   Her interest in "down-home" stories led to the study of
anthropology at Barnard College with the eminent Franz Boas, and to
field trips across the South and the Caribbean. During her lifetime,
two books of tales and lore were published: "Mules and Men" (1935)
and "Tell My Horse" (1938). The latter is a study of Haitian and
Jamaican voodoo. The more important book is "Mules and Men," a
pioneering work of black tales and voodoo: It is not merely a
compendium of tales because it also places the tales in their social
and cultural context. The reader experiences the community from which
the tales emanated as well as the roles the tales played in the life
of the community.</TE>
<TE>   In "Every Tongue Got to Confess" we are presented with the raw
material from which Hurston created "Mules and Men." That includes
such wonderful classics as "Why the Porpoise has his Tail on
Crosswise," "How the Lion Met the King of the World," "Why the Waves
Have Whitecaps" and the monumental "How Jack Beat the Devil."
Thecollection contains variants of these and many other tales already
found in "Mules and Men."</TE>
<TE>   Hurston wanted "Every Tongue Got to Confess" to be different. "I
am leaving the story material almost untouched," she wrote in a
letter to Hughes and quoted by Kaplan. "I have only tampered with it
where the storyteller was not clear. I know it is going to read
different, but that is the glory of the thing, don't you think?"</TE>
<TE>   But none of the material here can match that in "Mules and Men"
for precision of telling, rhythm, imagery and enjoyment. "Every
Tongue Got to Confess" contains more jokes than traditional tales,
the difference being not only the shorter length of jokes and their
emphasis on a punch line but also that folk tales have a complexity
and depth that reverberates after the laughter dies. Missing from
this volume is the almost epic dimension of the best tales in "Mules
and Men."</TE>
<TE>   However, folk tales, even jokes, are always valuable because one
of the best ways to understand a people and the challenges they have
faced is to study their stories. In this collection we learn much
about the attitudes of Southern black rural life in the 1920s. There
is the tale about the preacher who goes to heaven and learns that God
has a "big blackboard" and, as the angel John reads aloud your sins
from "de Big Book," you have to write them down. According to the
storyteller, "my uncle died 'bout twenty years ago an' went on up. He
wuz uh big preacher an' everybody said he sho wuz gointer git uh good
seat on de right hand side, right up tuh de throne. But last week
somebody died an' went up an' met my uncle on de way back to do earth
tuh git some more chalk." Ministers never fare well in black folk
tales.</TE>
<TE>   The reader also finds some wonderful exaggerations about weather
and the environment. "I have known it to get so cold that you would
have to carry a bucket along so when someone talked to you, you would
have to put the words in the bucket and carry them home and put the
bucket on the stove and let the words melt." Or what about the time
it was so hot "you had to feed the hens cracked ice to keep them from
laying hard-boiled eggs." When asked who was the shortest man someone
had ever seen, the response was, "I seen uh man so short he had tuh
get upon uh box tuh look over uh grain uh sand."</TE>
<TE>   This collection was supposed to have been published in 1929 and it
is not clear why it wasn't. Kaplan quotes Hurston's biographer,
Robert Hemenway, who speculates that "Hurston's publishers demanded
something more than the mere transcription of collected tales." If
so, the publishers were correct. "Every Tongue Got to Confess" is of
historical interest as is anything with which Hurston was involved.
But this collection throws into relief what an incredible job of
editing and writing Hurston did in "Mules and Men."</TE>

<TE>   From "Every Tongue Got to Confess"</TE>
<TE>   "Pig in de Poke"</TE>
<TE>   One time way back a white man sent his Negro hand to another
plantation to get a pig for him. He went and got it, but on the way
back it was hot and he was tired, so he sat down to rest and dozed
off to sleep. Some white men came along and saw him. They knew who he
was and everything, so they thought it would be fun to take out the
pig and put in a possum--so they did.</TE>
<TE>   When he got home his boss asked him, "Well, Sam, did you get the
pig?" "Yassuh, an' he sho is uh fine one, too. He kin crack corn
already." "Well, let's see him." Sam poured the possum out of the
bag, thinking it was the pig. He looked, the white man looked,
neither one didn't want to believe his eyes. "Look here, Sam, is you
dat big a fool to let 'em put a possum off on you for a pig?" "Boss,
I 'clare dat wuz uhh pig when I put 'im in dere." "Well, you just
turn round and go right back over the creek and get me a pig.
Furthermore, you tell Hiram Bickerstaff he better not try any tricks
on me, else I'll sink him wid lead."</TE>
<TE>   The Negro went on back and he was awful tired by this time, so he
sat down at the same place and went to sleep again. The men saw him
and knew what he was going back for, so they slipped the pig back
into the bag and went away. When he woke up he heard the pig grunting
in the bag and peeped in to see if it really was a pig again. He
looked at the pig and scratched his head and said: "Pig, be somebody.
Don't be switching back and forth. Either be a pig or a possum, but
be whut you is."</TE>
<TE>   "Why God Made Adam Last"</TE>
<TE>   God wuz through makin' de lan' an' de sea an' de birds an' de
animals an' de fishes an' de trees befo' He made man. He wuz
intendin' tuh make 'im all along, but He put it off tuh de last cause
if He had uh made Adam fust an' let him see Him makin' all dese other
things, when Eve wuz made Adam would of stood round braggin' tuh her.
He would of said: "Eve, do you see dat ole stripe-ed tagger (tiger)
over dere? Ah made. See dat ole narrow geraffe (giraffe) over dere?
Ah made 'im too. See dat big ole tree over dere? Ah made dat jus' so
you could set under it."</TE>
<TE>   God knowed all dat, so He jus' waited till everything wuz finished
before he made man, cause He knows man will lie and brag on hisself
tuh uh woman. Man ain't found out yet how things wuz made--he ain't
meant tuh know.</TE>

<HD>Following in His Footnotes</HD>
<DH>WILSON: A Consideration of the Sources, By David Mamet, The
Overlook Press: 336 pp., $26.95 paper</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JONATHAN LEVI</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It was Alfred North Whitehead who said "all philosophy is merely
footnotes to Plato." But it has taken David Mamet to write a footnote
positing Aristotle as the true author of "Dink Stover at Yale." This
observation is only one of the many instances of serendipity in
Mamet's latest work of fiction, a curio titled "Wilson: A
Consideration of the Sources."</LD>
<LD>   Presumably written several hundred years from now, "Wilson" is a
super-academic commentary on the ur-historical text of future
historians--the memories of a woman named Ginger who may have been
the wife of President Woodrow Wilson or a later President Wilson.</LD>
<LD>   Ginger's memories, preserved on hard drive, are all that remain of
the recorded history of man well into the 21st century, following a
computer crash of catastrophic proportions (caused by the Cola Riots
or the fire at the Stop 'n' Shop). Yet all is not lost. Academics
have survived with the hermeneutic hardiness of cockroaches. Out of
Ginger's fragments they shore themselves with commentary upon
commentary.</LD>
<TE>   What that means is that "Wilson" is 100% narrative-free. More than
300 pages of analysis, some as densely covered with footnotes and
footnotes to footnotes to footnotes as a PhD thesis on "The Sound and
the Fury."</TE>
<TE>   Fortunately, in many ways, the analysis owes more to Mel Brooks
than Cleanth Brooks. Take a chapter title, please: "Birnam Wood Do
Come to Dunsinane or: Cheezit, the Copse." Or an epigram or two: "We
now proceed from the confusing to the arbitrary," attributed to
Epictetus in "Who's Minding the Stoa?" or "'For how can we comprehend
the whole without an understanding of the parks?' Olmstead."</TE>
<TE>   Even in the footnotes, high culture and low culture rub
diphthongs--"And besides, the wench is dead" (Christopher Marlowe)
becomes "And besides, the witch is dead" (Yip Harburg). A passing
knowledge of Cockney rhyming slang helps explain why "Memories of the
Berkshire Hunt" may have more to do with foxes than with sherry. For
most readers, an undergraduate familiarity with National Lampoon is
sufficient to enjoy the pokes and jabs that Mamet makes on
ivy-encrusted nib-scratchers of academe.</TE>
<TE>   When academics spin out tomes of hundreds of thousands of
footnoted and indexed words on subjects whose dryness is matched only
by their obscurity, the motive is clear: tenure. When Mamet, arguably
the most successful playwright-filmmaker on the planet, does the
same, however, the pursuit of tenure does not seem, on first blush,
sufficient explanation. Why then this textual perversity?</TE>
<TE>   There is a reasonable evolutionary argument to the descent of
Mamet from the prolixity of Samuel Beckett and the economy of Harold
Pinter. Yet Mamet--at least the playwriting, screenwriting Mamet--has
always been a writer for whom words matter, and more than just mere
words, the choice of the best words.</TE>
<TE>   Reading "Wilson" is difficult because it is rarely clear why Mamet
chose the words or the paragraphs he did. It seems as if every word,
every paragraph, every sermon, diatribe, midrash, bad joke, good
joke, doggerel, ditty, proverb, beatitude, headline and footnote that
hadn't made it into his classic "Glengarry Glen Ross" or "American
Buffalo" or the film "Homicide" was unspooled by some latter-day
Krapp (of Beckett's "Krapp's Last Tape" fame) whittling away at a
hard drive with a pair of box cutters and then re-constructed by the
Firesign Theatre. At best, the effect is as entertaining as a
Grossingers double-bill featuring Joyce's "Finnegan's Wake" and
Nabokov's "Pale Fire" recited, say, by Shecky Green.</TE>
<TE>   Yet by trying to figure out "Wilson," are we falling prey to the
same dangers as those who sought meaning behind the memories of
Ginger? The academics who have searched for an "Inner Code," suggests
one "Wilson" commentator, have been suckers for a ploy "to market
Whippies. And those obtuse enough to've 'sent their boxtops in,'
found out the same."</TE>
<TE>   Another commentator provides, perhaps, the best clue to the
existence of this curious project: "Unfortunately, it is not only
religions which attract, inveigle and entrap by their claims to
simplicity. We all are attracted to the undiscovered. In it we find
that titillation of 'something-for-nothing,' whether in real estate,
in exploration, science, engineering--the attraction of each and all
may be reduced to that sympathetic excitation of the quintessential
human survival mechanism: the ability to imagine a way of getting out
of work."</TE>
<TE>   There you have it: the explanation for the existence of
cockroaches, the novels of Anthony Trollope and the Hundred Years'
War. And perhaps those of us historically obtuse enough to have sent
in our Mamet box tops are merely suckers. But there are worse ways
than reading "Wilson" to get out of work.</TE>

<DH>IRISH ON THE INSIDE: In Search of the Soul of Irish
America, By Tom Hayden, Verso: 312 pp., $25</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>FRANK McCOURT</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Toward the end of his latest book, "Irish on the Inside," Tom Hayden
throws down the gauntlet: history or amnesia. Take your choice. It
reminded me of a moment when I was teaching high school English. (No,
don't go away. This won't be a "personal" review.) We were discussing
the hyphenated American, so reviled by Woodrow Wilson.</LD>
<LD>   Except for one, my students were happy with their hyphens. I asked
that one: "Joey, if I were to wake you in the middle of the night and
ask you what you are, what would you say?"</LD>
<LD>   His reply was, "Tired."</LD>
<TE>   If Joey were to respond to the Hayden challenge, he might choose
amnesia, but if Hayden were his teacher, he wouldn't let him get away
with it, not in this book. Hayden would urge on Joey the glories of
an Italian heritage just as he dwells on the richness of his own
Irish heritage.</TE>
<TE>   And no, he won't let it go at that. "Irish on the Inside" is an
urgent book, fueled by a great, somber energy. As the title
indicates, it's about Irishness, the search for Irishness, the
definition of Irishness, the achievement of Irishness, the
perpetuation of Irishness. It is, first of all, the story of Hayden,
who angrily erases his racial designation from a census form, "White,
non-Hispanic" and pencils in "Irish, born in the United States,
American citizen." (Joey might have said, "Yo, man, that's too
much.") That response to a census form was, perhaps, the first stroke
in Hayden's long swim toward the Shamrock Shore.</TE>
<TE>   You wonder: "Why bother? Isn't it enough to be American? Heavens,
man, isn't it hard enough being human without taking on the Celtic
burden?" Especially when you're Tom Hayden. Tough, thoughtful,
radical, you've straddled history. You've faced the dogs and cops of
Chicago; you've bothered J. Edgar Hoover and you know what that can
lead to; you've sat (although sitting is not your favorite activity)
in the California Legislature for nearly two decades; you've fought
for migrants and immigrants and for the environment; you've denounced
globalization and assimilation and all things that lead to blandness.</TE>
<TE>   A little diversion here; comedian Fred Allen once defined the Lace
Curtain Irish, the more well-to-do of the clan, as "people who keep
fruit in the house even when no one is sick." He, of course, was
Irish. (Where else would you find a melancholy so hilarious?)</TE>
<TE>   Allen was looking at what happens to us when we become
respectable, a fate abhorrent to Hayden, sprung (if that's the word)
from the middle class, Midwest. If Hayden were Garrison Keillor, he'd
sweep aside all those sweet stories about a Scandinavian Lake
Wobegon. He'd swarm in there urging the natives to hold fast to their
Norwegian-ness, lest they be lost in the blandness of a consumer
culture.</TE>
<TE>   The United States is a big country, but not big enough for Hayden.
He would have made a hell of an Irish monk in ancient times, a great
missionary. You can see him setting out for distant shores, bringing
light to the barbarians of Britain and lands beyond. That's what he's
trying to do now--and there's an air of desperation in his life and
message. The world already knows much of that life, which is laid out
in Part I of his book. The titles of certain sections speak for
themselves: "What Is an Irish Soul?" and "The Sixties Made Me Irish."</TE>
<TE>   So far, so good. Along the way we meet Che Guevara, C. Wright
Mills, the Molly Maguires, the San Patricios. Here, Hayden is filling
in his Irish American past. When he says the '60s made him Irish, he
refers mainly to the Kennedys, particularly Bobby--the more Irish of
the two dead Kennedys. He glances briefly at Bobby's transformation
from close aide to Joe McCarthy to his role as champion of civil
liberties. He reflects on the growing conservatism of Irish
Americans, how they rushed to the flag of Ronald Reagan. Even as he
understands, he despairs. He understands that the late Richard J.
Daley, mayor of Chicago and arch tormentor of the Chicago Seven,
carries a "psychic burden" of the Famine generation.</TE>
<TE>   That is the value of Hayden's book, the search for understanding,
and Hayden expects us to engage in the same quest. A tall order.
(Joey would have been too tired.) New Age philosophy tells us,
"Wherever you are, there you are." Not for Hayden or thousands of
Americans who travel the globe in search of roots or identity or a
cure for whatever ails them. There are Americans and American Irish
who write of going back, buying ruined houses and castles, dealing
with the charming eccentricities of the locals as if County Cork were
an Irish Tuscany.</TE>
<TE>   Again, not for Hayden: When he returns to the Ould Sod, it's not
to pub and thatched cottage. It's directly to the North. Nobody goes
to the North; it's not a tourist destination and you go there only if
you're a spy, a diplomat, a gunrunner, a Sinn Fein sympathizer.</TE>
<TE>   Now why didn't Hayden go to a nice place like Dublin--or even
Limerick? Why the North? Because "A central theme of this book is
that the most independent Irish consciousness is rooted in the North
of Ireland ... where the ancient and enduring conflict between Irish
nationalism and British colonialism is most stark." To find himself,
to define his Irishness, Hayden has to dive right into the conflict.
Not for him the ramble through the groves of Blarney or Killarney. Up
the Falls Road he goes, or Sandy Row. The general reader will wonder,
"So?" And this, if you are a general reader, is where we lose you.
Before you can understand Part II, "Going North," you might want to
take courses in Irish history, economics, the geography of Belfast,
the byzantine world of politics in the North. If the following names
mean nothing to you, then you're wandering in the woods: De
Chastelain, "Mo" Mowbray, Trimble, Hume.</TE>
<TE>   "Irish on the Inside" is not a big book, but it is packed and
demanding. You'll be charmed, perhaps, by Part I but, again perhaps,
puzzled, mystified and at-swim in Part II. Read Part II slowly and,
whether you agree or disagree with Hayden's uncompromising
views--pro-Sinn Fein, anti-colonialist--you'll find it a valuable
guide to the craziness of a troubled area.</TE>
<TE>   When you finish Part II, put the book down. You'll need rest and
reflection before Part III, "Recovering the Irish Soul." This is a
call to action. Get off your assimilated rump and be Irish. And how
can you be Irish? The ways are beyond counting. Learn the language,
the geography, the history, the songs, the literature. Eschew the
"Paddy" stereotype, the St. Patrick's Day boozing, the rest of that
green nonsense. Psychologically and spiritually you must become an
archeologist. You must go digging to find your roots, yourself.</TE>
<TE>   Hayden is calling for a tremendous expenditure of intellectual
energy, defiant and defining. Tear down the Lace Curtain, dump the
fruit and wake up, Joey. It's time to be something besides tired.
It's history over amnesia.</TE>

<LD>DON'T LET'S GO TO THE DOGS TONIGHT: An African Childhood, By
Alexandra Fuller, Random House: 256 pp., $24.95</LD>
<LD>   You will not recognize the Africa in this memoir of an English
girl growing up in Rhodesia and the renamed nation it became,
Zimbabwe. It is not Hemingway's Africa or Beryl Markham's Africa or
Isak Dinesen's Africa. "Don't Let's Go to the Dogs Tonight" is not a
sentimental memoir, though sometimes a reader begs for sentiment.
Alexandra Fuller tells the story of a white family on the run from
Africa's independence: growing tobacco in Rhodesia until Mugabe is
elected in 1979 and their farm is taken; moving to manage a
750,000-acre cattle ranch in Zimbabwe until it is clear they are not
wanted there. "How can we," Fuller asks, "who shed our ancestry the
way a snake sheds skin in winter, hope to win against this history?
We mazungus. We white Africans of shrugged-off English, Scottish,
Dutch origin." Fuller's mother is a hard-drinking, horse-breaking
woman with more losses than gains since she came to Africa with her
husband and two daughters in 1971.</LD>
<TE>   Alexandra, born in England in 1969 and brought to what was then
called Rhodesia when she was 2, inherited her mother's molten core
and iron exterior. Of five children, only two, Alexandra and her
older sister, Vanessa, survived. In 1978, at age 9, Alexandra is left
in a store in a town to care for her baby sister, Olivia, then 2.
Olivia wanders off and drowns in a nearby pond. "My life is sliced in
half," Fuller writes, before Olivia died when the family was happy
and after, when Fuller's mother begins to drink herself into madness.
These are children who know how to shoot and kill. Their father is
steady, brave and softer-hearted than their mom. The land is not
described in grandiose terms but sensually, the way a child would
perceive its hot and cold, its smells and immediate dangers. There
aren't many whys: why we came, why this happened, why we survived,
why I love Africa. It just is.</TE>

<TE>   BREAK ANY WOMAN DOWN: Stories, By Dana Johnson,</TE>
<TE>   University of Georgia: 158 pp., $19.95</TE>
<TE>   "Why don't you come and sit with me for a spell, keep me company?
That's right. Right c'here on the porch with me. It's evenings like
this I get to thinking bout things," says the old lady in a
housedress to the reader in "Mouthful of Sorrow," one of many voices
in these rich stories by Dana Johnson. The voice in "Melvin in the
Sixth Grade" is an 11-year-old black girl whose parents' move to the
suburbs of L.A. pitched her headlong into a virtually all-white
school. "I ain't stuttin' these white foks," her older brother says
when she asks him if it doesn't feel funny to go to school there. By
stuttin', he means studying, using a word his parents and
grandparents have always used, but, already, he sounds strange and
foreign to his sister. "Three Ladies Sipping Tea in a Persian Garden"
is a stunning story, reminiscent of Gloria Naylor, about three women
resting from love troubles, drinking tea, discussing men and babies
and hair, a story in which happiness is so close, the narrator can
almost grab it. "Break Any Woman Down" is the story of a young black
stripper who falls in love with a white male porn actor, a story in
which the divisions between men and women are absolute and promise
generations of constant striving for love. You can hear Johnson's
voices ringing long after you put the stories down; you feel purged
and rested and in the company of friends, not strangers. No character
could stay a stranger long in this writer's hands.</TE>

<TE>   RED DUST, By Gillian Slovo, W.W. Norton: 340 pp., $25.95</TE>
<TE>   "You don't know what it is to wait for your son's return," James
Sizela, black headmaster of a school in a small town in South Africa,
says to the lawyer who wants to help him find his son's body and
bring the murderers to justice. Gillian Slovo does. The daughter of
Ruth First and Joe Slovo, white anti-apartheid activists, Gillian
attended the hearing of her mother's murderers before the Truth and
Reconciliation Commission, and her novel, "Red Dust," bears this
burden. The year is 1999. Sizela's attorney, Sarah Bacant who is
white, left South Africa 14 years earlier, the year that Sizela's son
disappeared. She went to Harvard and then became a prosecutor in New
York. Her mentor and professor, Ben, calls her from South Africa and
asks her to take the case. When she arrives, they argue about the
value of the Truth Commission.</TE>
<TE>   Yet while doing justice to the raw complication of apartheid's
aftermath, Slovo falters. Her characters lack the depth, dimension
and moment of the historic circumstances they are set in. In Slovo's
hands, the guilty are sometimes more interesting than the righteous,
but in the end, the truth is more powerful than the law.</TE>

<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Question: Our board has always held closed board of directors
meetings. Then our homeowner association was advised by the attorney
general that the Open Meetings Act section of the Davis-Stirling Act
requires they open board meetings to homeowners.</LD>
<LD>   The board announced that the meetings were now open to homeowners.
But although we were allowed to attend meetings, we were then
immediately asked to leave because, the board stated each time, "We
are now retiring into executive session to discuss possible
litigation due to the attorney general's letter."</LD>
<LD>   I have been trying to find out how the board spends our money. I
feel the board is shirking its responsibility to the homeowners. This
has been going on for more than two years.</LD>
<TE>   How can homeowners get the board to comply with the Open Meeting
Act, and is this a proper reason to retire into an executive session?</TE>
<TE>   Answer: Every month, California's approximately 33,000 common
interest developments generate an estimated $1 billion in assessment
payments from homeowners, which pass through homeowner association
bank accounts. The association boards of directors control that money
and have every right, along with each homeowner who is a member of an
association, to be concerned about where and how that money is spent.</TE>
<TE>   Ten years after the passage of the Davis-Stirling Act, the
legislature enacted Civil Code section 1363.05, the Common Interest
Development Open Meetings Act. In defiance of the law, some boards
still block homeowner participation.</TE>
<TE>   Section 1363.05(b) says: "Any member of the association may attend
meetings of the board of directors of the association, except when
the board adjourns to executive session to consider litigation,
matters relating to the formation of contracts with third parties,
member discipline, or personnel matters. The board of directors of
the association shall meet in executive session, if requested by a
member who may be subject to a fine, penalty, or other form of
discipline, and the member shall be entitled to attend the executive
session."</TE>
<TE>   By law, those are the only reasons for a board to meet in
executive session. A discussion of hypothetical litigation is not
included and, under a strict interpretation of the law, is
inappropriate for executive session.</TE>
<TE>   All actions taken by the board must be included in the minutes of
the meeting, whether taken in executive session or not, and the law
specifically states that a general note of the discussions in
executive session must be included in the minutes.</TE>
<TE>   Homeowners must demand that if the board is intent on applying the
law, it apply all the law and report their discussions from executive
sessions in the minutes.</TE>
<TE>   This ruse of calling an executive session appears to be a method
for boards to deny homeowners access to regular meetings. When used
to conduct the regular business of the association, it constitutes a
breach of the fiduciary duty the board owes to the homeowners.</TE>
<TE>   Boards that break this law may be exposing themselves and all
other homeowners to potential liability while leaving little recourse
for homeowners who have been shut out of the process. The opportunity
for mismanagement and fraud increases as homeowners are given less
access to the same books and records as board members.</TE>
<TE>   Until the law changes to add an immediate penalty for breaking the
law, even a new board is no guarantee of a change.</TE>
<TE>   It only takes one lawsuit and one judgment against an association
for a board to realize that hiding information from homeowners can be
far more damaging than its efforts to remain in control, since every
homeowner shares in the liability.</TE>
<TE>   Professionals who advise boards to stretch the meaning of the law
to deprive the majority of information also expose the entire
community to potential liability. This causes increased frustration
among the non-board-member homeowners who cannot find solace with the
state's attorney general because, despite the billions of dollars
that pass through association bank accounts every month, the attorney
general's office says there simply is not enough money in the budget
for investigation or enforcement.</TE>

<HD>Fannie Mae Permits Some Lenders to Waive Appraisals</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KENNETH R. HARNEY</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>WASHINGTON -- Could 2002 be the year when you buy a home or refinance
a mortgage, and your lender surprises you with the news: Oh, by the
way, we're not going to need an appraisal on your property? Just give
us $50 at closing and we'll eliminate the $300 to $350 you'd normally
have to pay.</LD>
<LD>   Could the most traditional and long-standing piece of the home
buying and financing puzzle--the professional property appraisal--be
headed for oblivion?</LD>
<LD>   Probably not--and certainly not in 2002. But the biggest player in
the American housing finance market, mega-investor Fannie Mae,
quietly has been moving in that direction. With no public fanfare or
announcement, Fannie has been permitting some lenders to dispense
with appraisals on home purchases and refinancings, in exchange for a
$50 fee.</LD>
<TE>   Known as the "property inspection waiver," the pilot program is
being offered around the country by a select group of mortgage
companies who sell loans to Fannie. The lenders welcome the plan
because it allows them to close mortgages faster, attract
price-conscious loan shoppers and sometimes even lower their rate
quotes. It also allows them to dispense with their customary
contractual warranties to Fannie regarding the mortgaged property's
condition and value. Those warranties open lenders to financial
penalties should a home's stated value later turn out to be bogus.</TE>
<TE>   Fannie Mae declines to identify the mortgage lenders taking part
in the $50 appraisal-waiver program.</TE>
<TE>   Word of Fannie's no-appraisal-needed experiment has professional
appraisers understandably upset. Frank K. Gregoire, chairman of the
Appraisal Committee of the National Assn. of Realtors, calls the idea
"radical" and worrisome.</TE>
<TE>   "People seem to have forgotten the lessons of the savings and loan
crisis of the 1980s," said Gregoire. He was referring to the
multibillion-dollar losses racked up by thrift institutions that lent
money in recessionary markets on the basis of inaccurate or
fraudulent property appraisals. Many of them subsequently had to be
closed down or bailed out by the federal government, which seized and
then resold thousands of overvalued properties.</TE>
<TE>   Patrick Turner, a professional real estate appraiser in Richmond,
Va., called Fannie's new program "ridiculous" and "dangerous."</TE>
<TE>   "Common sense will tell you," said Turner, "that you can't know
what a house is worth" without some form of appraisal. He cited the
example of a home he recently examined that appeared normal from the
outside, but was a mess inside--with multiple building-code
violations, including no enclosed bathroom in the entire house.
"[Fannie Mae is] trying to pull rabbits out of hats" by eliminating
appraisals, said Turner, but "they're going to hurt the consumer and
hurt themselves."</TE>
<TE>   Home buyers need professional appraisals, said Turner, "so that
they've got an independent judgment that what they're paying [for the
property] is the correct price."</TE>
<TE>   Fannie Mae, for its part, said it is not eliminating appraisals by
any means, but instead is allowing some lenders to dispense with them
when there is sufficient electronic valuation data available on a
given house. A Fannie Mae official said that about three-quarters of
the home-purchase mortgage applications it now receives through its
automated underwriting system--Desktop Underwriter--do not require
full, traditional appraisals.</TE>
<TE>   Some applications qualify for a total waiver. Others require
appraisals with exterior-only examinations by the appraiser. Only a
minority of applications need interior and exterior examinations as
part of the appraisal.</TE>
<TE>   Fannie's competitor, Freddie Mac, has a more restrictive
appraisal-waiver program. Freddie requires no appraisal on home
purchase transactions where the down payment is 20% or more, and the
borrower's credit profile is strong. In such cases, Freddie charges
the lender a $200 fee, which most lenders then pass on to borrowers
in lieu of a full-cost appraisal.</TE>
<TE>   Fannie's $50 pilot program fee, by contrast, costs much less, and
can be used on home purchases and refinancings where the borrower's
equity is as low as 10%.</TE>
<TE>   Fannie's and Freddie's waivers or reduced appraisal requirements
are available only on loans up to their $300,700 purchase maximum.</TE>
<TE>   The upshot of Fannie's new moves on appraisals? For most
consumers, $50 certainly sounds better than $300 or $350. After all,
it's the lending institution--not the borrower--that traditionally
has demanded a professional valuation of the real estate securing a
loan.</TE>
<TE>   But Turner has a point, too: An independent appraisal could steer
you away from paying too much for a house. If you spend $200,000 on a
house that a professional appraiser would have valued at $180,000,
you've saved $350 on the appraisal, but you've spent $20,000 too
much.</TE>

<LD>Supermodel-actress Naomi Campbell is leasing a Beverly Hills home at
$20,000 a month with an option to buy at just under $3 million.</LD>
<LD>   The house, behind gates, has four bedrooms in about 5,000 square
feet. The home also has a pool.</LD>
<LD>   Campbell has been keeping an apartment in the TriBeCa area of New
York City, and in December she also rented a two-bedroom flat
overlooking the Thames in London, sources said. The high-rise
complex, with gym and tennis courts, was completed last year,
according to the British press. Campbell, 31, was born and raised in
London.</LD>
<TE>   She appeared in such films as "Quest for Fire" (1981) and on such
TV series as "The Cosby Show" (1988) and "Fresh Prince of Bel-Air"
(1990), but she became a supermodel in 1989 after posing as the first
black woman on the cover of French Vogue.</TE>
<TE>   Since then her acting career has largely taken a back seat to
modeling, although she has been called a black Marilyn Monroe or
Brigitte Bardot. Campbell appeared on stage for the first time in the
fall, starring in "The Vagina Monologues" in San Francisco.</TE>
<TE>   She is also known for her support of Nelson Mandela and his
Children's Fund, and the Dalai Lama in his efforts toward building
kindergartens for poor children around the world, including those in
Jamaica, where Campbell's mother, a ballet dancer, was born. Campbell
studied ballet in London.</TE>
<TE>   Kurt Rappaport of Westside Estate Agency, Beverly Hills, handled
the Beverly Hills lease, sources said.</TE>
<TE>   Actress Crystal Bernard, who co-starred in the sitcom "Wings"
(1989-97), has sold her Beverly Hills-area home in the mid-$4-million
range.</TE>
<TE>   The home has six bedrooms in 10,000 square feet, behind gates. The
home, on more than an acre, also has a pool and a motor court.</TE>
<TE>   Bernard, 40, replaced Reba McEntire last year in the lead role of
Annie Oakley in a Broadway production of "Annie Get Your Gun."</TE>
<TE>   Bernard put her home on the market about a year ago so that she
could buy a smaller home here and a place in Nashville. She is a
country and western singer and songwriter as well as an actress.</TE>
<TE>   Brian Green, who played David Silver--Tori Spelling's love
interest on the Fox series "Beverly Hills, 90210"--has listed his
former Hollywood Hills home at $1.2 million.</TE>
<TE>   Built in 1983, the house was recently remodeled and has two
bedrooms, including a master suite, in 3,130 square feet. The
Mediterranean-style home also has a wet bar and music studio.</TE>
<TE>   Green purchased another home on the Westside last March for about
$1.7 million, sources not involved in the sale said at the time.</TE>
<TE>   Green, who played a record producer on "Beverly Hills, 90210," has
been a rapper as well as an actor in recent years. His first album,
"One Stop Carnival," was released in 1996. He was cast to play the
love interest of a series regular last year in eight episodes of the
Showtime series "Resurrection Blvd." Last year, Green, 28, reportedly
dropped Austin as his middle name.</TE>
<TE>   Dolores Blumenfeld of Paramount-Rodeo Realty has the listing, real
estate sources said.</TE>
<TE>   The Beverly Hills home of the late producer Lester Persky has come
on the market at $5.9 million.</TE>
<TE>   Persky, who died in December at 76, produced such movies as
"Equus" (1977), "Hair" (1979) and "Yanks" (1979). He also was
executive producer of such Emmy Award-winning TV miniseries as "A
Woman Named Jackie" (1991).</TE>
<TE>   His home has four bedrooms plus staff quarters and a guest
apartment in about 8,800 square feet. Situated on nearly an acre, the
house also has a tennis court and a pool.</TE>
<TE>   Persky owned the classic contemporary-style villa for a few years.
Iris Cantor, women's health-care advocate and widow of the late Wall
Street veteran B. "Bernie" Gerald Cantor, previously owned the house,
which she extensively refurbished. Actor Gene Hackman owned the home
before Cantor.</TE>
<TE>   The office of John Bruce Nelson &amp; Associates has the listing.</TE>
<TE>   Kevin Kelly Brown, executive producer of the TV series "Roswell,"
has purchased a two-bedroom home, with a den, in Sherman Oaks for
$709,000.</TE>
<TE>   The home, with valley views, is on a half-acre lot with a
basketball court.</TE>
<TE>   Brown's two sisters, brother and both parents have been dancers
with the American Ballet Theatre. The family's fame formed the basis
for the 1977 Fox film "The Turning Point," according to Brown.</TE>
<TE>   Brown, the only nonprofessional dancer in his family, also lives
part-time in New York. He has more than a dozen TV projects in
development and is co-producing several films.</TE>
<TE>   Rick Chimienti of DBL, Beverly Hills, represented Brown in buying;
Diana Hanson of Coldwell Banker, Studio City, had the listing.</TE>
<TE>   Now that the figures are in, 2001 almost rivaled the banner year
of 2000 in terms of high-end home sales on the Westside, and more
houses were sold last year at $20 million each.</TE>
<TE>   Cecelia Waeschle, who tracks Westside sales for Coldwell Banker
Previews in Beverly Hills, gave these stats:</TE>
<TE>   In 2001, there were 199 sales of homes at more than $3 million
each; in 2000, there were 210. Of the 199, 66 were for houses at more
than $5 million each, in contrast with 69 for the previous year. In
2001, 15 houses sold at more than $10 million each; in 2000, there
were 17.</TE>
<TE>   At $20-million-plus, three sold last year, two in 2000.</TE>

<HD>Even Though Home Isn't Old, It May Need Upgrades</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BARRY STONE</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Question: The home I'm buying is in a desirable neighborhood, but it
was built in 1980 and seems old. I'm concerned about functional
obsolescence, noncompliance with newer codes and what it might cost
to renovate the building to current standards.</LD>
<LD>   Have construction codes undergone major changes since this house
was built? Is it worth the cost to make upgrades? These questions
have me in a quandary as to whether I should proceed with this
purchase. What do you advise?</LD>
<LD>   Answer: Renovations of a home typically entail far more money,
time, stress and commitment than people envision at the outset.
Therefore, much consideration should be given to your plans before
you embark on a project of this scope. Even though the home is not
significantly old, considerable changes might be needed to achieve
what you have in mind.</LD>
<TE>   Many changes have occurred since 1980 with regard to building
codes and construction standards. Upgrades and revisions to the code
are continuous, with revised editions appearing every three years.
Your home in question was built seven code versions ago.</TE>
<TE>   Significant code changes since 1980 include safety upgrades to
electrical systems, smoke alarms and guardrail systems. In some areas
of the country, seismic safety standards have been improved, and
energy-efficiency requirements are continually being upgraded. The
list is seemingly endless, but for those who are satisfied with a
relatively older home, these changes do not make a 1980 residence
undesirable.</TE>
<TE>   If the price is right and the home inspection report discloses no
major problems, the vintage of the building should not be cause to
walk away. However, if you're planning to bring a 1980 home into
compliance, then number crunching is essential.</TE>
<TE>   Consult a general building contractor for an estimate of costs to
affect the building upgrades you have in mind. Increase this figure
by about 25% and add that amount to the sales price of the property.
This figure might approach what you will actually spend for the final
product. Then compare that total with the price you would pay for a
comparable home of recent vintage--one that does not need upgrades.
These numbers should help you determine the advisability of
proceeding with the project.</TE>
<TE>   Don't Drop an Inspection to Speed Up a Home Sale</TE>
<TE>   Q: You often stress the importance of a home inspection with every
real estate purchase. But when the market is hot, an inspection can
be a disadvantage. Sometimes the only way to get an acceptance is to
bypass the inspection. How do you view this situation?</TE>
<TE>   A: Waiving the right to a home inspection in an overheated market
gives a buyer a competitive edge in the rush to escrow. It can help
to score big points in the first quarter of the transaction but can
cost you the game later. Real estate investments involve major
capital outlays with large long-term consequences. A long-term game
plan at the outset can determine whether you win or lose in the end.</TE>
<TE>   Hot markets, the kinds that entice buyers to make rush-to-judgment
offers, have often been described as "feeding frenzies." These are
emotionally driven environments in which the rush to buy can be an
invitation to financial disaster and years of regret.</TE>
<TE>   There is no limit to the numbers and kinds of problems that can be
discovered in the course of a home inspection. The unseen problems
you might acquire, just to meet the demands of a sellers' market,
could saddle you with major repair costs not anticipated at the time
of your no-contingency offer. Worse still, there could be unknown
safety problems of a significant nature, ranging from electrical
hazards to a faulty fireplace; from substandard gas piping to a
furnace that leaks carbon monoxide.</TE>
<TE>   So how do we satisfy two conflicting needs, obtaining an accepted
offer in a hot real estate market while acquiring essential
disclosure information? How do we make a no-contingency offer without
committing to a blind purchase? One approach is to make an offer that
includes your right to have a home inspection for information
purposes only, but without hinging the deal on the inspector's
findings. In a sense, there is still a degree of risk, but now it
becomes a fully informed risk, taken with open-eyed information. In
the event that the home inspection reveals problems so major as to
eclipse the desirability of the property, you can still walk away
from the deal. You might not recover your purchase deposit, but in
some cases that would be a minor loss compared with the ache of a
regretted acquisition.</TE>
<TE>   It is possible to enter a frenetic real estate market without
giving up the consumer protection provided by a home inspection. When
big stakes are involved, it is seldom wise to charge in without
taking a critical look. Regardless of the market, the best advice is
to know what you're buying, before you buy it.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Home sales in Southern California were down slightly in November from
high levels a year ago, the result of tight inventory and
stretched-out escrows. In the same period, prices edged up to a new
record, a real estate information service reported.</LD>
<LD>   A total of 22,795 new and resale houses and condos were sold in
Los Angeles, Riverside, San Diego, Ventura, San Bernardino and Orange
counties in November. That was down 11.8% from 25,840 for the month
before, and down 6.9% from 24,486 for November 2000, according to
DataQuick Information Systems.</LD>
<LD>   A decline from October to November is normal for the season. As of
last November, 278,260 Southland homes had been sold, up 0.6% from
276,571 in 2000, and the most since 313,103 were sold during January
to November in 1989.</LD>
<TE>   Pushed up by a surge of new home sales, the median price reached
$238,000 in November, a new record. That was up 2.1% from $233,000 in
October, and up 9.2% from $218,000 for November 2000.</TE>
<TE>   The average monthly mortgage payment that Southland buyers
committed themselves to paying was $1,192 in November. In November
2000, it was $1,194, when interest rates were higher. The all-time
peak was April 1989 at $1,360, DataQuick reported.</TE>

<BD>From Project Sentinel</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Question: The property owner and I are very good friends, and we have
always handled our rental arrangements verbally. He now wants to
raise my rent and says because we are friends, he doesn't have to
give me a written notice. Is this true?</LD>
<LD>   Answer: It is risky to conduct rental matters casually; the best
approach is for all rental conditions to be in writing. This approach
will protect both of you from possible misunderstandings or
disagreements that could jeopardize your friendship as well as your
tenancy.</LD>
<LD>   Some rental notices are more important than others. Notices that
have a time or cost consequence, or that are legally mandated, need
to be in writing.</LD>
<TE>   In your case, the property owner should serve you with a valid
Notice of Change of Terms of Tenancy that details the rent increase.
Per California Civil Code 827 (effective from Jan. 1, 2001, to Dec.
31, 2005), if a rent increase is more than 10% within a 12-month
period, a month-to-month tenant is entitled to a written 60-day
notice of the rent increase. For rent increases of 10% or less
outside of a 12-month period, a written 30-day notice is permitted.
This code does not apply to leases.</TE>
<TE>   Contact your local housing program for more information.</TE>
<TE>   Tenants Do Not Have to Reveal Arrest Records</TE>
<TE>   Q: The new rental application I'm using has a clause that asks
prospective tenants to declare whether or not they have ever been
arrested or convicted of a crime. The last few applicants have told
me this question is illegal. Is this true?</TE>
<TE>   A: You have a right to collect or ask for information relevant to
making your rental decision, but a prospective tenant still retains
certain rights to privacy.</TE>
<TE>   Arrest records are not always public records. Also, they are not
considered reliable as an indicator of behavior because of the
presumption of innocence and because of concerns about the unfair
impact on certain groups such as minorities. These concerns arise
because an arrest is just an allegation, not a judicial decision.
Thus, asking about arrest records might be an invasion of privacy and
might also be considered to be discriminatory.</TE>
<TE>   However, you are entitled to ask about any record of felony
convictions. These are public records and are sufficiently reliable
indicators of a person's trustworthiness to permit your request for
disclosure as a legitimate business inquiry. Keep in mind that your
prospective tenant will not be required to reveal juvenile court
convictions because they are confidential, and he or she will not
have to disclose felony convictions that subsequently have been
cleared or reduced because of good conduct.</TE>
<TE>   You may want to avoid this questionable area and rely upon credit
reports, personal references, employment history, bank records and
former landlord comments to make a sound business decision. Contact
your local mediation program for more information.</TE>
<TE>   Ignoring Tenants' Calls Is Not a Good Solution</TE>
<TE>   Q: I am a manager of a very large apartment complex and have a pet
peeve. When leaving telephone messages for me, some tenants who have
caller ID equipment don't reveal this in their message. Since I don't
have caller ID but do have a blocked number, this means that when I
return their call, I have to redial their number a second time using
the unblock code. With the large number of tenants I support, this
can add up to a great waste of my time. I want to serve notice on all
my tenants that if they have caller ID and they don't leave this
information in their messages for me, I will not return their call.
Can I do this?</TE>
<TE>   A: You can, but not returning a tenant's telephone call would not
be prudent or professional. The tenant may have a personal safety or
other legitimate privacy concern such as employment-related matters
that causes her or him to block the telephone number.</TE>
<TE>   If you don't return the call, regardless of the number of times
you have to redial, you may be enlarging a serious repair problem or
housing matter. It would be better to devise methods of ensuring
prompt communication while respecting a tenant's privacy concern.</TE>
<TE>   Because you feel strongly about this matter, you could revise your
answering machine message to request that the caller to leave this
information. You could also say that having this information will
benefit them by allowing you to respond more quickly to their needs.
Even though this is frustrating, not responding or returning a
tenant's call is not in anyone's best interest.</TE>

<DH>Construction projects that stall can become a nuisance for
the whole neighborhood.</DH>

<AU>DIANE GARRETT</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Worse than living next-door to a construction project is living
next-door to one that grinds to a halt.</LD>
<LD>   Residents on one Redondo Beach street look forward to the day when
construction crews start making noise again. For more than a year,
neighbors have been comparing notes about the half-finished remodel,
wondering when--and if--it will ever be done.</LD>
<LD>   The residents on either side of the home moved away a year ago, so
now new neighbors listen to the flapping plastic covering and try to
make sure teenagers don't try to use the site as a party zone.</LD>
<TE>   In early September the city issued a notice to clear debris on
public nuisance grounds and the property was tidied, but months
later, construction has yet to resume. The chicken wire awaiting
stucco covering continues to rust from exposure to the elements.</TE>
<TE>   "We'd like to have it done," said next-door neighbor Seth Berger,
whose wife, Colleen, recently had a baby, and who worries about the
value to their property the longer the work remains unfinished.</TE>
<TE>   No one is more dismayed than the owners of the home. Donald and
Katherine Madden ended up in court suing their now-bankrupt
contractor. They have little chance of collecting a fraction of the
judgment they won or of living in their partially completed house any
time soon. The whole process even broke up their 17-year marriage.</TE>
<TE>   The Maddens' predicament is extreme even by the standards of
typical stalled construction projects, which tend to revolve around
money constraints or disputes between contractors and homeowners.
Under the state's Uniform Building Code, a project isn't considered
abandoned until six months pass without work.</TE>
<TE>   Smaller cities might see only a handful of stalled projects each
year. "It's not that common," said Redondo Beach code enforcement
officer Larry Baker.</TE>
<TE>   But as chief building inspector for the sprawling city of Los
Angeles, Bob Steinbach encounters many stalled or abandoned projects.
While the department doesn't track these cases, Steinbach has heard
many explanations for the delays.</TE>
<TE>   "It may be the homeowner got into a dispute with the contractor,
they want to change the plans, or it may be money," Steinbach said.
"Just sitting here, I can think of a dozen reasons."</TE>
<TE>   He said he thinks the primary cause of delays is disputes between
contractors and homeowners. Contractors working on spec usually want
to turn the project around as quickly as possible so they can sell
the home and repay the loan.</TE>
<TE>   Under the state Building Code, building permits last for a
two-year period, which may seem like an eternity to neighbors coping
with the disruptions construction invariably brings. Contractors may
request a six-month extension or take out another two-year permit for
the portion of the project not completed if the original expires.
However, if the latter occurs, they may have to resubmit their plans
if the code has changed. The state tends to pass a new code after
every major earthquake.</TE>
<TE>   Redondo Beach chief building officer Steve Huang said projects
usually finish before the first year is up, rarely exceeding the two
years allotted in the permit.</TE>
<TE>   Building officials caution neighbors that projects may seem
stalled when they're merely moving at a slower pace than neighbors
would like.</TE>
<TE>   "People call and ask, 'How long am I going to have to deal with
this?'" said Hermosa Beach senior inspector Charlie Schwartz. "What
the law says is: As long as they're making progress, it's OK."</TE>
<TE>   In Palos Verdes Estates, home to several multi-year construction
projects in recent years, the city works with contractors to make
sure they paint the house and landscape "where appropriate" while
interior detail work is being completed. Planning director Allan Rigg
said the city does this to reduce the nuisance from extended projects
and contacts contractors at the rate of once every three months.</TE>
<TE>   "Construction is always disruptive to any neighborhood--that will
always be the case," Rigg said. "But we really work to mitigate the
impact."</TE>
<TE>   Although municipalities try to keep their eye out for lagging
projects, it's usually neighbors who call attention to the situation.
They're more likely to notice lack of progress than an inspector
occasionally driving by.</TE>
<TE>   "There are a couple ways we can tickle the job," Steinbach said.
"I may mark my calendar and, if I don't see any progress on a job,
I'll check back on it."</TE>
<TE>   He said about 5% to 10% of inspections are devoted to follow-up
visits. Every week, his department conducts 12,000 inspections of new
construction projects alone. "But usually the first indications come
from neighbors," Steinbach said.</TE>
<TE>   If building departments suspect a project has stalled, they
usually try to contact the contractor first. Schwartz said Hermosa
Beach sends letters to owners of abandoned projects to try to find
out what's going on.</TE>
<TE>   "If we think there has been no construction progress in 180 days,
we can expire the permit, but we don't have to," Steinbach said. "We
usually try to find out why no progress is being made."</TE>
<TE>   The last thing cities want to do is throw a monkey wrench into a
troubled project and delay it further--that's not good for the
community, Steinbach said. "We do not want to be punitive because
that doesn't do anybody any good."</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, cities try to make sure the property has not
become an eyesore or a safety hazard attracting kids or drug
activity. If they determine it has, they might notify the owner to
clean up the property.</TE>
<TE>   "If they don't, we have the authority to clean it up and charge
them for it," Steinbach said. "We try not to enforce it, but the
tools are there if we need to use them."</TE>
<TE>   According to Steinbach, in the entire city of Los Angeles, "you
could count the number of filings in the past six months on one
hand."</TE>
<TE>   In a worst-case scenario, an abandoned project might have to be
demolished. But that is considered drastic and highly unusual.</TE>
<TE>   Far better is for construction to resume, such as the work on two
new homes a few blocks away from the Maddens' in Redondo Beach. An
existing home was demolished, but work stalled in the early stages.
The project sat idle for months and months, to the point where weeds
sprung up around a tractor parked on the site. Construction
eventually resumed and, nearly three years later, two new homes are
for sale.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the Maddens are trying to stave off foreclosure and
secure financing to get their house finished. "Here I am, stuck with
a lot of payments and no way to go," Madden said. "It's an ugly
story, but maybe something good will come of it."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   If Construction Stalls, Call City</TE>
<TE>   If a construction project in your neighborhood seems to have
stalled before completion, contact your city's building department.
It can advise you whether the project has been abandoned and send a
code enforcement officer to make sure the site isn't violating safety
or nuisance ordinances.</TE>
<TE>   The city of Los Angeles has a toll-free number, (888) LA4-BUILD,
to handle resident building and safety inquiries. Consult your phone
book for the number of the building department in your city.</TE>

<LD>Donald and Katherine Madden's desire to add a second story to
accommodate an extended family led to mounting debt, a yearlong legal
battle with South Bay Remodeling--which folded and filed for
bankruptcy--marital breakdown and possible foreclosure.</LD>
<LD>   The contractors have been referred to the attorney general and
rated unsatisfactory by the Better Business Bureau because of
complaints about business practices, but those measures won't help
finish the Redondo Beach house Katherine Madden grew up in. Nor does
the couple stand to collect much of the $158,826 judgment it won
against South Bay Remodeling last fall.</LD>
<LD>   "Every day I would be looking at it and there was nothing I could
do," said Donald Madden, who maxed out his credit cards paying for an
extended motel stay and his mortgage at the same time. "I got
upside-down so fast."</LD>
<TE>   "I can't even tell you the nightmare it has caused us," Katherine
Madden said. "If I would have known what would happen, I would have
bought a new house with the amount of money I spent."</TE>
<TE>   There was no way to anticipate that things would turn out this
way. After researching the contractor, the couple signed a contract
for a 16-week job in late January 2000, intending to live in part of
the house during the remodel. Madden said they had to decamp to a
motel when the portion of the house they were living in was damaged a
few weeks into the project.</TE>
<TE>   The couple soon hired a consultant to investigate the job after a
worker tipped them off that things were amiss.</TE>
<TE>   By August 2000, construction ground to a halt amid charges of
alleged misappropriation, according to court documents. South Bay
Remodeling slapped the Maddens with a breach of contract lawsuit; the
couple promptly countersued on negligence and fraud charges.</TE>
<TE>   Late last October, the couple won their judgment, but by that time
South Bay Remodeling owners Terry and Marilyn Taylor had already
filed for Chapter 7 personal bankruptcy in U.S. District Court. The
state suspended the company's contractor's license in April after the
original sponsor withdrew support, referring the case to the attorney
general for possible criminal charges. The Taylors' attorney did not
respond to calls for comment.</TE>
<TE>   According to David Berchauer, the Maddens' attorney, the only
money they have a chance of recovering is a portion of the $7,500
contractor's bond. "The judgment was against the corporation, which
probably has next to no assets," Berchauer said.</TE>
<TE>   The Laguna Hills-based attorney, who has been working on the case
pro bono, said he believes contractor bonds should be higher to
protect consumers against contractors who don't adequately perform
services.</TE>

<HD>Don't Get Him Started</HD>
<DH>Sean Penn hates most Hollywood films, especially the
feel-good kind. So why did he agree to star in the heart-warming 'I
Am Sam'?</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RACHEL ABRAMOWITZ</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Sean Penn doesn't believe in film preservation. He hates those
hallowed classics like "The Grapes of Wrath" and " Gone With the
Wind," a film he describes as "an abominable fraud of a movie."</LD>
<LD>   "I sometimes feel that they should just burn them all and start
anew," he says.</LD>
<LD>   Penn giggles wickedly--a hoarse, breathy, gasping chortle. It's
the first time in the last hour that a flash of mischievousness has
animated his rough-hewn features.</LD>
<TE>   Penn says he's found that an eradication of past history can be
rejuvenating.</TE>
<TE>   "I had a house burn down once, and everything in life burned,
except my family, and it was so liberating. I didn't have a bad
moment about it," he says. "It sort of reinvigorated my interest in a
lot of things. I wonder if there should be some kind of anarchy," he
says, laughing.</TE>
<TE>   It's Monday, lunchtime at the bar at the Hotel Bel-Air, and Penn
is here to promote his film "I Am Sam," which opened for an
Oscar-qualifying run at the end of December and reopens in wider
release at the end of this month. This is the kind of task he usually
detests and, for most of it, he has swathed his personality in
rigorously polite wariness.</TE>
<TE>   He's wearing a black suit with a black shirt and a black tie. A
little goatee and longish pompadour give him a faintly menacing look,
especially because they make him look almost exactly like the
convicted killer on death row he played in "Dead Man Walking." He
sits with his arms crossed, almost defensively, except when his
cranberry juice and Caesar salad arrive, a salad from which he
meticulously picks off the croutons and most of the cheese.</TE>
<TE>   The only other occupants of the bar are an ever-expanding klatch
of rich blue-haired ladies, decked out in holiday suits and hats,
discussing drinking and shopping, their tinny tones constantly
threatening to drown out the hushed, cracked voice of perhaps the
greatest actor in America.</TE>
<TE>   It's Sean Penn's mission, and in some ways his plight, to mount a
one-man battle against mindless, soul-numbing, "embarrassing"
entertainment. "I'm not somebody you'd want to go to most American
movies with. I'd really upset you," he warns. "I get crazy. I feel
like they're [the filmmakers and the Hollywood system] are all up
there saying, 'You're an idiot! You're an idiot!' And they're not
just saying it to me. They're saying it to everybody around me, and
some people who aren't idiots are believing it about themselves and
that becomes the broad audience.</TE>
<TE>   "They're contemptuous of everything, of themselves, of everything,
all wrapped up in a package of the feel-good movie of the year. They
talk about violence in movies and all of that stuff. My attitude is,
a bad movie is violence!"</TE>
<TE>   Penn isn't ranting as he says this. His voice never rises above a
murmur, each word carefully plucked with meticulousness and an air of
self-awareness. His demeanor is more philosophy professor-cum-beat
poet matter-of-factly delineating the hard-won wisdom of years of
experience.</TE>
<TE>   It would be easy to surmise that Penn has mellowed since his first
incarnation as a sneering, bad-boy wunderkind, married to Madonna,
shooting at helicopters and brawling with paparazzi. For the first
half of his career, he was known as much for his fury as for his
craft. But his friends caution that this is a facile reduction of a
complex and unusually steadfast and loyal personality. "He was sweet
and dangerous 20 years ago, and he's sweet and dangerous now,"
explains producer Art Linson, who hosted Penn's wedding to Robin
Wright in 1996.</TE>
<TE>   Penn is clearly uncompromising. For several years, he claimed
publicly that he was quitting acting, but in fact, he explains, he
can't because "I can never get ahead of the game financially because
of the movies I do." He prefers directing. In the last decade, he's
crafted such challenging fare as "The Crossing Guard," a harrowing
tale of a father haunted by the death of his daughter, who was killed
by a drunk driver, and "The Pledge," about a man's obsessive--and
soul-destroying--search for a serial killer.</TE>
<TE>   "Sean's a very poetic, hard-nosed director," says Jack Nicholson,
who starred in both. "He goes his own way. He's all about being
substantial in the work."</TE>
<TE>   When Penn acts, it's often not for much money, opting to work for
scale (about $2,000 a week) in Woody Allen's "Sweet and Lowdown"
(1999), or for a reported $300,000 for Terrence Malick's "The Thin
Red Line" (1998)-- although he received a reported $5 million to star
as a mentally challenged adult in "I Am Sam."</TE>
<TE>   Nor is he an actor because of a burning need to be loved. Penn
hasn't been lovable on-screen in almost 20 years, preferring an array
of psychopaths ("Casualties of War," "Carlito's Way"), sociopaths
("Hurlyburly") and misfits ("She's So Lovely"). It's often been his
special self-appointed task to mine the familiar shards of humanity
among the human wreckage. In his two Oscar-nominated performances
("Sweet and Lowdown" and 1995's "Dead Man Walking"), he's managed to
earn audience sympathy for a louse-like musician and a racist
murderer.</TE>
<TE>   The world of Penn movies is tough, alternately mind-provoking and
mind-numbing, full of anger, occasionally realized good intentions,
dollops of human ugliness and flashes of beauty. They're not for
light escapist movie-watching on a Friday night.</TE>
<TE>   Even Nicholson, who admires Penn's' integrity, says, "Sean's a
funny guy. I keep hinting around, 'Let's try to lighten up a bit.' He
just laughs."</TE>
<TE>   Penn says his movie choices have "nothing to do with my mind."</TE>
<TE>   "I always hunted long and far for any writer who can write without
living in the corner of his artiness, and they're not there because
they're all invested in the comfort of this comfort-addicted country.
The only writers who made any sense to me were writing about tougher,
less heartwarming things.</TE>
<TE>   "But mostly, any movie that's been heartwarming the last 20 years
has been a piece of crap, in my mind," he says succinctly. "Every
single one of them has been awful and embarrassing and degrading to
me, and so I never responded to those scripts. This was a script that
wasn't like that."</TE>
<TE>   He's referring to "I Am Sam," a full-blown weepy about a man with
the mental capacity of a 7-year-old struggling to raise his
7-year-old daughter, whom the state wants to remove from his home.
For the jaded moviegoer, the premise might sound like an echt
Hollywood melodrama, but Penn's performance is stripped of any prefab
sentimentality. He's clearly inhaled the spirit of John Cassavetes,
and it's a performance less powered by shticky theatrics than blunt
emotion.</TE>
<TE>   Penn works hard to make the audience identify with Sam's plight.</TE>
<TE>   It's almost as if Penn's assumption that the audiences won't
relate to Sam because of his infirmity has freed the actor, indeed
inspired him, to go for the emotional jugular. It's released a
sweetness in Penn's performance not apparent since the days of
"Racing With the Moon" (1984). For a man almost no one would call
warm and fuzzy, Penn is wrenching in his ability to portray a truly
unselfish love and a kind of universal dismay many parents feel when
faced with small, mewing children.</TE>
<TE>   Penn doesn't offer to elucidate why he was drawn to the material
(generally, he simply knows whether or not to do a part before he's
even finished reading the script). Nor will he comment on the grand
subject of fatherhood except to smile and say he likes it, "all of
it," and that as a father, "I try not to stay in my head too much."
The family lives in a compound north of San Francisco, and right
before this interview, his wife and two tow-haired children,
10-year-old daughter Dylan and 8-year-old son Hopper Jack (named
after Dennis Hopper and Jack Nicholson), milled about the hotel
entryway, his son doing wheelies on inline skates. Penn explains, "He
never walks. He's either skateboarding or wheeling or bicycling."</TE>
<TE>   Penn's "I Am Sam" performance might garner Academy Award
consideration, but since Dustin Hoffman, Geoffrey Rush and Daniel
Day-Lewis have already won Oscars for playing characters with extreme
disabilities, his chances seem diminished. Despite his two
nominations, Penn has never attended the Academy Awards and refuses,
point-blank, to even discuss the subject even though it's clear the
film opened in December to meet the academy deadline.</TE>
<TE>   Penn isn't so much a cynic as an angry idealist, a throwback to an
earlier era when Hollywood wasn't a corporate machine efficiently,
and impersonally, pumping out product for the masses, and when art,
even movies, seemed important.</TE>
<TE>   "Hollywood is much more creatively corrupt than it is economically
[corrupt]," he says. "It takes $1 for them to kill their dreams.
Their dreams are worth more than $1."</TE>
<TE>   Penn has been called an acting savant, and his process remains
mysterious. It starts with what he calls "sponge work"--in the case
of "I Am Sam," visiting L.A. Goal, a nonprofit center for adults with
developmental disabilities, where writer-director Jessie Nelson and
co-writer Kristine Johnson researched the script.</TE>
<TE>   "I usually start pretty well outside," he says. "I'll start
thinking about the clothing and things like that, and then movement.
Bit by bit, the other things kind of follow. I always used to think
about it just like building a cage. You would build it strongly and
you're very free within it when you're shooting."</TE>
<TE>   "The first day he came to the center, he was completely ego-less,"
Nelson recalls. "He became invisible. They were on an assembly line
folding T-shirts into plastic bags, and he immediately sat down and
started folding. He sat next to an autistic man who didn't think Sean
was folding correctly. Sean would listen to every direction and try
to fold meticulously and would ask them questions, and very gently
became their friend. He was very good at the center. I think he felt
their kindness."</TE>
<TE>   Michelle Pfeiffer, who co-stars in the film as a driven, yuppie
lawyer who takes Sam's case, says Penn was "really different than I
expected. I expected him to be a much more narcissistic actor than he
is. He's incredibly present and giving. A lot of times when people
are that good, they kind of act alone, and he is just so opposite of
that."</TE>
<TE>   "I think of acting as a discipline," Penn says. "It's a discipline
in terms of a craft. It's a discipline in terms of"--he pauses,
choosing his words carefully--"you know, the unbridled ego, I tend to
hurt my life with outside of acting. And that's the greatest thing
about it."</TE>
<TE>   Even from the very beginning, acting was a means to enable his
directing. He grew up in Malibu, the son of Eileen Ryan, an actress,
and Leo Penn, an actor who was blacklisted in the '50s and turned to
TV directing. Sean attended Santa Monica High School with surfing
buddies Emilio Estevez and Charlie Sheen, and began directing super-8
films. "There were night shoots and such, and I couldn't collect
enough people so I found myself in them," he says.</TE>
<TE>   Despite his father's experience, he didn't start out disillusioned
but impassioned. "I'm 41 years old. The time that I was 10 to 20 was
1970 to 1980. Look at the movies I was seeing! I get the chills."</TE>
<TE>   After a brief stint studying auto mechanics and speech at junior
college, Penn delved into acting with the Group Repertory Theater and
later with acting teacher Peggy Feury in L.A. It was around this time
that he became "obsessed" with learning the craft; many nights he
just climbed back through an open bathroom window to sleep at Feury's
studio.</TE>
<TE>   His first film, "Taps" in 1981, focused on an insurrection at a
military school, and starred such new faces as Timothy Hutton and Tom
Cruise.</TE>
<TE>   "It was fraternity row. We were all a bunch of young actors making
more money than we'd ever made ... $15,000 after taxes when I was
finished," Penn says. The film nonetheless initiated his lifelong
sense of disappointment. Filmmaking was less an exercise in pure
creativity than unfocused chaos, with performance often subjugated to
camera lens and cinematography.</TE>
<TE>   He followed up with a hilarious portrayal as the stoned surfer
Spicoli in the 1982 teen classic "Fast Times at Ridgemont High," and
turns as an amoral, druggy, would-be spy in "The Falcon and the
Snowman" (1985) and a corrupt son who betrays his murderous father in
"At Close Range" (1986).</TE>
<TE>   "Sean's sense of loyalty to the people he has relationships with
is unparalleled in my experience," says James Foley, who directed "At
Close Range."</TE>
<TE>   "When he says I am in or I am with you, take it to the bank. It's
rare. Sean will be totally disengaged from any consideration of the
most self-protective thing to do when he makes a decision. If he
makes a commitment to something, he's going to do it come hell or
high water. I've come to really respect that."</TE>
<TE>   Against the studio's wishes, Penn decided Foley was the man to
direct "At Close Range," based solely on their emotional connection.
He hadn't even liked Foley's prior film, "Reckless." "He had this
feeling he never wavered from," Foley says. "This is Sean's greatest
strength. The conventional wisdom and easiest road holds no sway over
his own perception."</TE>
<TE>   Penn's mother and brother acted in the movie, and his then-wife,
Madonna, did the soundtrack. It was a template for how he would work
as a director--stocking his films with those closest to him.</TE>
<TE>   It was during his media-infested marriage to Madonna that Penn
became as famous for his fists as for his craft, and landed in jail
for a month in 1986 after punching an extra who tried to take his
picture on the "Colors" set.</TE>
<TE>   These days, Penn mostly reserves his pugnaciousness for his words,
although his temper sometimes trails him like Pigpen and his cloud.</TE>
<TE>   "I Am Sam" started out as a project at Fox 2000, a studio that
grew noticeably cooler toward the idea after a well-publicized letter
Penn wrote to Chairman Rupert Murdoch. The actor was enraged that the
studio wouldn't provide a private jet to take him to a screening of
"The Thin Red Line" in Texas, a gesture Penn claimed would cost the
studio $6,000. (The studio put the price tag at $40,000.)</TE>
<TE>   When asked about the letter, Penn, who's been trying to quit
smoking for the last six months, pauses to light up a cigarette. Penn
doesn't want to be misconstrued as a perk-fiend he was just irked
that Fox refused to facilitate his promotion of a film, for which
he'd already worked for six months in Australia at a fraction of his
price.</TE>
<TE>   "These are people who take the plane to go to the bathroom!" he
says. The fact that Murdoch's company owns a number of tabloids
further incensed him. "That's an agency that's owned and operated by
a person who trades on the pain of people with his gossip magazines!"</TE>
<TE>   His children get to see a kinder, gentler side. When he takes them
to the movies, he even makes sure to bottle his disdain. Although
part of him thinks much of Hollywood's history deserves a spot in the
incinerator, another part has been carefully showing the kids
classics such as "Harold and Maude" and "The Graduate." "I was
thinking of the tone, the feeling that you walk away with," he says,
a tad remorseful about having shown "The Graduate" to them. "I wasn't
thinking about people having affairs with their girlfriend's mother.
They had some reactions to that."</TE>
<TE>   He even agreed to co-star in the ultimate feel-good show "Friends"
in the fall because "I like the show. I needed the money and because
I'd be king with my daughter. Her favorite show is 'Friends.' Also
it's scary, and it's good to be scared sometimes. When I get up in
the morning, I don't walk around thinking that I'm the funniest guy
on the planet."</TE>
<TE>   "I Am Sam" director Nelson says, "I never saw his dangerous side.
In fact, he only got mad once." Penn's anger was directed at a dog
wrangler during a scene in which his character (who has just landed a
job as a dog walker) attempts to walk six dogs at once.</TE>
<TE>   "The wrangler was making the dogs perfect movie dogs, and Sean
wanted them to be really dogs. I remember him saying, 'Let them be
dogs! They don't have to be Disney dogs. Let it be real!' Sean has a
very deep need for the truth. If something keeps him from that, it
will agitate him."</TE>

<HD>Amnesty's New Cause</HD>
<DH>In a bid to recruit younger members, the rights group seeks
to buff up its image through Hollywood links.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DANA CALVO</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In an episode this season of "ER," actor Noah Wyle, who plays the
young, honorable Dr. Carter, walked in front of the cameras wearing a
gray T-shirt with the Amnesty International logo on the front. There
were no lines in the script about either Carter's T-shirt or the
40-year-old human rights organization, but the message to NBC viewers
was clear: Guys like Carter--cool guys--dig Amnesty International.</LD>
<LD>   But the path of that message from Amnesty International to the set
of an incredibly popular, award-winning drama is less clear.</LD>
<LD>   Through his publicist, Wyle said that although he thinks Amnesty
is "terrific," the shirt was happenstance. It was just one of several
he could have selected that day from the costumers, including one
bearing a Nike logo. That's true, but there was a backup plan to
ensure Amnesty's "prime-time, pro bono, product placement."</LD>
<TE>   Had Wyle chosen the Nike shirt, another cast member or an extra
would have been given the gray T-shirt.</TE>
<TE>   "We sent these T-shirts around to costumers ... and a lot of them
were so happy to get Amnesty some exposure," said Julie Weinhouse,
owner of Hero Product Placement, an advertising firm whose paying
clients include Lego, Hawaiian Punch and Radisson. "The costumers
said they'd try to get it on somebody. But celebrities don't want to
officially endorse something, so it's an implied endorsement."</TE>
<TE>   A new day has dawned for Amnesty International, which is
determined to replenish its aging member base with a new generation
of activists. Suddenly, it is not just a gadfly to despots and a hero
to thousands of oppressed individuals. Amnesty International is
employing sophisticated media strategies that dwarf its previous
attempts to keep up with the times. The new strategies include
surgical prime-time placement, a post-Academy Awards bash and a film
festival in West Hollywood.</TE>
<TE>   "We need a revolution from people in a business that has clout,"
said Bonnie Abaunza, who was hired away from a small film company
last spring to start Amnesty International's national office of
artist relations. "We are asking them to champion a particular
prisoner of conscience. We're going out actively into the community
and asking them to help us take this to a whole new level, including
an advisory board of artists who will help shape our strategies."</TE>
<TE>   Abaunza came on board in May and asked Weinhouse to start working
on prime-time series that same month. She also made the rounds of
producers and actors in hopes of linking Amnesty with future
projects. Simply put, Abaunza knew that prime-time subliminal
programming would not be enough. She needed to penetrate Hollywood.
Then the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11 occurred, and the strategy to
tie Amnesty's logo and literature to several movie premieres was
postponed for nearly three months. When she returned to the drawing
board, the Christmas movie premieres were already set in stone, and
Abaunza revamped the campaign to fit in with Hollywood's next news
cycle--the film festivals and award show season of late winter.</TE>
<TE>   "Sept. 11 reinforced for every American that the violation of
people's human rights have a profound and direct impact on our own
lives, our security, our economic lives, our public health," said
Amnesty International USA's executive director, William Schulz. "Who
is in a better position to reach both mainstream Americans and
different demographic segments of the population with the message
that human rights matter, and that our very lives are at stake if we
deny people's human rights around the world? Who is in a better
position than the artistic community? Nobody."</TE>
<TE>   Amnesty faces different kinds of challenges than the causes that
Hollywood has embraced in the past. Typically, the media elite rally
around causes when one of their own is affected: Paul Glaser
championed AIDS awareness after his wife died from the disease. Katie
Couric became a spokeswoman for colorectal cancer after she lost her
husband to it. Muhammad Ali and Michael J. Fox have pushed for
research into Parkinson's disease.</TE>
<TE>   But few members of the entertainment industry have been held in
foreign jails, banished to life in exile or imprisoned without
trials. Amnesty must get image makers emotionally invested in the
plight of an unidentifiable population of victims. In a sense, then,
Amnesty has to make stars of its survivors, make them knowable to an
industry willing to adopt them.</TE>
<TE>   A good example is Jose Ramos-Horta, the Nobel Peace Prize-winning
East Timor refugee, who thanks Abaunza for bicoastal talent
representation and a book deal. The 52-year-old Ramos-Horta, who has
returned to his homeland to help rebuild the country, is writing a
book about his experience. Weeks after Abaunza came on board, she put
him in touch with a few talent agencies, including William Morris,
which ultimately signed Ramos-Horta with Suzanne Gluck in New York
and Alicia Gordon in Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   "For him, it's a real channel for getting out his message of hope
for people oppressed everywhere," Ramos-Horta's spokeswoman, Mary
Wald, said by phone from outside New York City. "Bonnie also hooked
us up with HarperCollins, one of the four big publishers. We're
looking into film rights too. Martin Sheen and Emma Thompson have
been involved in a project about him before, and he spoke with Andy
Garcia about possibly playing him.... This is what Bonnie's getting
started here--introducing Jose and East Timor to Hollywood. We're
anticipating that great things will come out of it. It's been a
really interesting networking thing, where a lot of us have hooked
together our East Timor contacts."</TE>
<TE>   Abaunza's campaign, Artists for Amnesty, which will be launched in
the next few weeks, is a rebranding of the organization in response
to a member survey commissioned three years ago. That research
revealed that Amnesty's typical member is much like "ER's" Dr.
Carter, except much older--a big problem for a member-supported
organization.</TE>
<TE>   "We need to get our message out to people who are not doctoral
students," said Dennis R. Palmieri, spokesman for Amnesty
International USA. "This outreach is about visibility--about casting
that net wider."</TE>
<TE>   For Amnesty folks, that means hanging out with popular young
Hollywood stars whose very association with the group will spur high
school and college-age students to participate in Amnesty events and
send in donations. (Eighty-five percent of Amnesty's budget comes
from individual donations of about $50 each.)</TE>
<TE>   Amnesty's membership woes are well known among heads of liberal
and progressive nonprofits, said Morris Dees, co-founder of the
Southern Poverty Law Center, a 500,000-member civil rights
organization that opened its doors in Montgomery, Ala., in 1971.
According to Dees, the typical center member is now almost 60.</TE>
<TE>   "It's been a constant for the past 15 years to try to enlarge the
universe you can go to to try to enlist new supporters," he said.
"There are a few ways that we bring in new people. The biggest way we
try is the Internet.... Unfortunately, the average Internet gift
tends to be small."</TE>
<TE>   But Amnesty executives say that they're more than amenable to an
influx of modest donations. In fact, one of their new goals is to
attract young people through the Internet and through independent
film projects that deal with themes of human rights.</TE>
<TE>   Amnesty International began in 1961 as a modest letter-writing
campaign to free two Portuguese students who were wrongly imprisoned.
By 1977 it had won the Nobel Peace Prize, and by the mid-'80s, students on
college campuses across the country were writing letters in protest of
South Africa's apartheid policies and the U.S. support of freedom fighters
in Central America. Amnesty had tapped into star
power, with Susan Sarandon, Sting and Bruce Springsteen anchoring
rallies and outdoor concerts. In the 1990s, Amnesty embraced the
power of e-mail as a way to blitz human-rights violators, from world
leaders to local officials.</TE>
<TE>   But by the late 1990s, when data from the member-profile survey
came back, Amnesty executives began to wonder if its logo of a lone
candle wrapped in wire could inspire a new crop of activists. There
were 1 million members worldwide and a full-time office at the U.N.,
but it seemed the membership was composed increasingly of the Kent
State generation, people whose children seemed to care more about
Napster than the plight of women and children smothered by the
Taliban.</TE>
<TE>   "We're about building a culture of human rights," spokesman
Palmieri said. "And in order for us to do that, we have to be at the
epicenter of pop culture."</TE>
<TE>   In February, the Artists for Amnesty campaign will bring to West
Hollywood a version of the film festival that is already popular in
Seattle.</TE>
<TE>   "These buzz cultivational events work both ways. The studios get a
lot out of it. We have definitely enjoyed strong support from the
artistic community for a long time," Palmieri said. "What we have not
had until now is a structured program to sustain their involvement
and meet their needs. In the past, we've done big promotional
concerts and screenings to reach out to our celebrity supporters to
come out and support our work.... It's been more ad hoc in the past.
It's always important to be reaching out to a new generation of
artists and a new generation of members. We have to roll with the
times."</TE>
<TE>   Abaunza is also putting together Amnesty's first post-Oscar party.
Held in conjunction with the city of West Hollywood, the party faces
stiff competition from long traditions such as the Governors Ball;
the Vanity Fair Oscar party at Morton's; the Spago party (a tradition
initiated by literary agent Irving "Swifty" Lazar); Elton John's
party; and Miramax's party at the Beverly Wilshire Hotel with host
Harvey Weinstein.</TE>
<TE>   "The focus of the guest list is socially conscious, interested,
hip people," said Fran Solomon, deputy to West Hollywood Mayor John
Heilman. The venue has not been locked down, although Solomon and
Abaunza have been meeting with the manager of a popular
restaurant-nightclub on Sunset Boulevard to work out a donated space
for the evening.</TE>
<TE>   The Amnesty party theme will be "Young Hollywood," and the motive
is member recruitment through glitzy press.</TE>
<TE>   There's no telling if these strategies--the prime-time product
placement, the film festival or the Oscar party--will have a dramatic
effect on Amnesty's membership, but Amnesty is aware it needs to gain
ground in a city where almost every A-list actor is already
associated, if only for public relations reasons, with a noble cause.</TE>
<TE>   The group will look for an edge Hollywood-style, with good-looking
people doing good deeds before well-positioned cameras.</TE>

<HD>It's Like Training for the Olympics</HD>
<DH>Dakin Matthews has been preparing all his life for a
grueling, rhyming role in South Coast Rep's staging of 'The School
for Wives.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE BOEHM</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Olympic Arts Festival in 1984 ushered Dakin Matthews onto the
Southern California theater scene; since then, the Bay Area
transplant has won plaudits as one of the Southland's most learned
and devoted explorers of classic plays.</LD>
<LD>   While working at the Mark Taper Forum and the Ahmanson in Los
Angeles, the Globe Theatres in San Diego, South Coast Repertory in
Costa Mesa, and with his own small classic theater, the Antaeus
Company in North Hollywood, the former Shakespeare professor has
established himself as a Renaissance man of the stage: actor,
director, translator, teacher, playwright and manager.</LD>
<LD>   Now, at 61, Matthews is taking on what he regards as his own
Olympic acting event. At South Coast Repertory, he is playing
Arnolphe, the haplessly obsessed, female-fearing comic butt of
Moliere's 1662 classic, "The School for Wives." It is a huge
part--840 lines in rhyming couplets. Arnolphe is onstage for 32 of
the 34 scenes, reports director David Chambers, and many of his
speeches go on for a page or more.</LD>
<TE>   South Coast is using Englishman Ranjit Bolt's translation, first
staged in 1997 by director Peter Hall in a production that had a
six-month run in London's West End. Chambers is setting South Coast's
"School for Wives" in the 1890s because "I think 17th century France
is really another planet" and he doesn't want any sense of archaism
or foreignness to keep today's audiences from picking up on the
enduring psychological currents in the play.</TE>
<TE>   With his round build, the gently spoken Matthews doesn't look as
if he has been in training. But he sees Arnolphe, the largest part in
his career, as a peak test of what he has learned in 35 years of
professional acting.</TE>
<TE>   "It's like somebody who trains to be an athlete all of his life,
and somebody says, 'You're going to run the mile for us in the
Olympics,'" Matthews said in a recent interview at South Coast
Repertory. "The part takes enormous skills. A prodigious memory,
lightning-fast comedy skills, and the skill to take a passage this
long"--he holds his hands a foot apart--"and know that it's not just
one sentence after another, but that it actually has a shape as a
larger piece of word-music. It's not enough to make every line clear;
you must also know how every line fits into that shape."</TE>
<TE>   Chambers notes that many of those long speeches are emotional
roller coasters in which Arnolphe moves rapidly from desperation to
rage to antic determination. "Any actor can go from quiet to loud;
this role takes enormously rapid internal adjustments to make it have
any kind of truth."</TE>
<TE>   Meeting such a standard would seem to entitle an actor to
considerable bragging rights. But for Matthews, the best way to bring
the blustery but insecure Arnolphe to life--with all his jealously
scheming, control-grasping outrageousness and pathos--is to submerge
his own ego.</TE>
<TE>   "As you get older as an actor, you begin to feel much more humble.
You begin to say, 'I don't want to impose my personality on anything
here.' I feel like a medium. If I've developed all the skills
necessary for the character to live in me, I don't create Arnolphe.
Moliere created Arnolphe. I just have to give him the way to get out.
And if you weren't as trained and experienced, it wouldn't come out."</TE>
<TE>   What will come out is a character whom today's audiences are apt,
off the bat, to find downright hissable. The middle-aged Arnolphe
believes that being cuckolded--cheated on by one's wife--is the most
insufferable thing a man can endure. To that end, he has handpicked
his spouse-to-be, Agnes, and raised her from the age of 4 to be meek,
obedient, mindless--"a total dunce," as Bolt's translation puts it.
Such a creature, Arnolphe believes, will be incapable of cuckolding
him.</TE>
<TE>   As it turns out, Agnes is a natural, honest and open-hearted
charmer; she proves immune to Arnolphe's preposterous "schooling" and
blossoms into a fetching lass who ignites true love in a fitting
young suitor. The stakes become desperately high for Arnolphe when he
too falls deeply in love with the girl he had thought of as a mere
ornament and chattel. But it is far too late for his redemption.</TE>
<TE>   Cuckoldry as a social disgrace may not resonate with modern
Americans as it did with the 17th century French, acknowledges
Matthews, who brings a scholar's acumen to a discussion of the play.
"But what the fear of cuckoldry leads to in Arnolphe is very
recognizable. The power women had then was the power to cuckold you.
Now we [men] have other reasons to fear for our place in society, but
that sense of male insecurity which results in the oppression of
women is as current today. Men are constantly thinking themselves
threatened by women."</TE>
<TE>   Matthews feels no need to try to make a bombastic, obsessive
fellow like Arnolphe sympathetic or likable. "But what you do is you
keep peeling away layers. You show that there is a person there who
didn't have to be that way. Opportunities are offered to Arnolphe to
be something else, but he clamps down and won't let it happen. He's
his own worst enemy, and he suffers enormously."</TE>
<TE>   Jack O'Brien, artistic director of the Globe Theatres, says
Matthews' strong suit is his ability to uncover surprising,
humanizing dimensions in a character. O'Brien directed Matthews last
summer as Sir Toby Belch in "Twelfth Night." Matthews' performance as
that coarse, drunken practical joker captured "an implicit broken
sadness, an alcoholic ruin [of] what was probably once a decent guy,"
O'Brien said. "He kept coming up with stuff that was hilariously
funny and heartbreaking at the same time. He can hit all the comedic
highs, but look beyond that and show you the dimensions of the person
inside. He doesn't try to make characters pretty but succeeds in
making them real."</TE>
<TE>   Matthews also triumphed last February as Lord Capulet in Peter
Hall's otherwise tepidly received "Romeo and Juliet" at the Ahmanson.
"Matthews knows how to imbue such petty tyrants with both an amusing
fussiness and a weird kind of ferocity," wrote Times critic Michael
Phillips. "For about two minutes, this 'Romeo and Juliet' becomes a
tragedy about Lord Capulet--a walking, fuming reason for teen
suicide."</TE>
<TE>   Matthews' career as an actor in Shakespeare and other classics
began 40 years ago at, of all places, the Vatican in Rome. He was
part of a select group of Americans who were studying theology there
in hopes of qualifying for the priesthood. Matthews had felt a
calling since he was about 12. Theater was a recreational
extracurricular for the aspiring priests, and Matthews, who had done
some acting as an undergraduate philosophy major at St. Joseph
College Seminary in Mountain View, Calif., played Sir John Falstaff
in "Henry IV."</TE>
<TE>   He gave up the priesthood--he decided that the celibate life
wasn't for him--and instead became a professor of English. He taught
dramatic texts at the Juilliard School, and Shakespeare and advanced
grammar courses at Cal State Hayward; his never-completed doctoral
dissertation at New York University was about the clash between
paganism and Christianity in "King Lear."</TE>
<TE>   Starting in the mid-1960s, the scholar-by-day got plenty of acting
opportunities at Bay Area theater companies, among them the American
Conservatory Theatre in San Francisco. The Olympic Arts Festival
brought Matthews to Los Angeles in 1984, for a part in Charles
Marowitz's "Sherlock's Last Case" at the Los Angeles Actors' Theatre.
As the father of four now-grown children ( with his wife and fellow
dramatist, Anne McNaughton), Matthews decided that film and
television work would be the ticket to pay college tuitions. He moved
to L.A. and has played dozens of screen roles, although none
prominent enough to make him readily identifiable.</TE>
<TE>   "I always get recognized in airports by people who think I went to
school with them or something like that," he says with a laugh. He
hopes the writers of TV's "The Gilmore Girls" and "The King of
Queens" will come up with something soon for recurring characters he
has played on each. Meanwhile, Matthews is happily deluged with
chances to do theater.</TE>
<TE>   At the Globe, he is not only a regular actor, but has directed
"Henry V" and adapted "Henry IV," parts 1 and 2, into a single play
that starred John Goodman as Falstaff. Matthews also has written
several plays, including "Uncommon Players: A Shakespearean
Celebration," which the Globe produced in 1995. O'Brien, the Globe's
veteran artistic director, hires Matthews as "my own personal
dramaturge"--or textual advisor--whenever he directs a Shakespeare
play.</TE>
<TE>   "He is one of a very few Renaissance personalities I have run
across in my career," O'Brien said.</TE>
<TE>   In the past decade, Matthews has developed an unusual specialty as
a translator of 17th century Spanish comedy. "The Proof of the
Promise," by Juan Ruiz de Alarcon, is his third such project.
Previews begin Jan. 31 for the Antaeus Company's monthlong run of the
show.</TE>
<TE>   Matthews confesses to being overmatched in one of his many
endeavors: "I'm terrible at raising money." That's a problem, because
Antaeus, launched in 1991, has no permanent home and needs donations
to renovate a building supply warehouse it has acquired. Antaeus has
staged two or three plays a season at other venues but hopes to mount
its first full season next fall in its own 99-seat theater. Has he
ever wondered whether he might have gotten further in life as a
specialist rather than a polymath?</TE>
<TE>   "No. I actually think if you're a stage actor, you have to develop
other skills in order to survive. There's going to be a lot of
downtime [between roles], so you should take writing projects, not so
much so you have a screenplay in your pocket that somebody is going
to produce, but because it keeps your creativity alive. This last 14
months has been terrific for me. I'm living off my savings, I'm
practically broke, but I got to play five glorious roles. TV and
movies pay the bills and get you recognition. But I've realized,
'What God made you for was to do stage plays, so you've got to keep
doing them.'"</TE>

<LD>Story line: Hancock Park piano teacher's 30-year-old songs get
bootlegged in Japan, unearthed in America, even sampled on a rap
record.</LD>
<LD>   The goods: Margo Guryan's "Take a Picture," re-released in 2000,
and "25 Demos," released last fall, both available at
www.franklincastle.net.</LD>
<LD>   The heroine: Guryan, a jazz student who turned to pop songwriting
after jazz great Dave Frishberg turned her on to the Beach Boys' "God
Only Knows," had songs recorded by artists such as Mama Cass Elliot,
Claudine Longet, Glen Campbell and Bobbie Gentry, the Lennon Sisters,
and Spanky &amp; Our Gang (including the modest hit "Sunday Morning") in
the 1960s. "At that time, if you wrote good songs you could get a
record deal," she says. "People wanted songwriters; it didn't matter
whether you were a singer."</LD>
<TE>   The album: But sing she did, and "Take a Picture," a collection of
delicate, sunny songs with bossa nova flavor and cooed vocals, was
released in 1968 on Bell Records. "When I heard the album, it was
like discovering a secret 'Pet Sounds,'" says Linus of Hollywood, the
pop artist whose label, Franklin Castle, handled the "Picture" and
"25 Demos" releases. He estimates they have sold at least 8,000
copies worldwide. "It's been quite a coup to take an obscure '60s
record and get it into the indie mainstream."</TE>
<TE>   Fast forward: "For years, I didn't listen to the songs, or play
the album. Something like that becomes part of your past and you just
accept it," says Guryan, who had married her publisher, David Rosner,
and moved from New York to Los Angeles. "Then we get a royalty check
from Japan. And we find out [copies of 'Take a Picture'] are drawing
exorbitant prices on EBay." It led to her album's re-release and the
reconstruction of her demo songs for "25 Demos."</TE>
<TE>   Just a sample: One string introduction she penned for
Campbell-Gentry even ended up on a song by Mad Rapper. "It's still
amazing to me to have something resurface after 30 years," she says.
"People say I've been rediscovered. It's not true--I've been
discovered."</TE>
<TE>   And now: "I love teaching. It's not something I did out of
frustration. I'd like to write songs, but how would I write now? I
haven't figured that out yet."</TE>

<HD>A Competition That Plumbs Pools of Talent</HD>
<DH>The artists in the Metropolitan Water District's contest
turn a certain liquid into potent works.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Visitors to the Richard J. Riordan Central Library in downtown Los
Angeles march up the steps, occasionally casting a quizzical glance
at the series of pools--lined in tile, studded with sculptures and
fountains--that divide the center of the walk up to the entrance on
Flower Street. The work, "Spine" by Jud Fine, is complex and full of
references to the pursuit of knowledge and big ideas, all linked,
underlined and made metaphoric by one of the artist's primary
materials: water.</LD>
<LD>   Fine's use of water made his work eligible for the 2001
competition Liquid Art, sponsored by the Metropolitan Water District
of Southern California. Of 120 entries, it was chosen, along with 19
other works, as the best examples of public water art in Southern
California. Color photographs by Tom Bonner of the projects are on
display at Self-Help Graphics in Los Angeles until next Sunday, and
then will go on tour throughout the water district.</LD>
<LD>   "Spine" was one of the most popular entries, according to one of
the judges, Pat Gomez, manager of the city of Los Angeles' art
collection and murals program. The work addresses such ideas as
evolution and language, with statues of a bird of prey, a lizard and
an amphibian skeleton in three successive pools, and the risers are
incised with phrases from many languages, from French to Chinese.</LD>
<TE>   Although fountains in front of public buildings are common enough,
Fine uses water in a symbolic sense, such as in the silver human head
protruding from the end of the uppermost pool. Its lidded eyes point
skyward, while water bubbles from its nostrils and mouth, and slips
down behind the skull into the small semicircular pool below. The
word on the wall beneath the head is "clear."</TE>
<TE>   "Each one of the three pools are named: 'Clear,' 'Bright' and
'Lucid,'" Fine has said, "words often used to describe air, water and
intelligence, three entities that define human existence."</TE>
<TE>   As complex and layered as Fine's references are, his public
artwork has also been claimed for a more familiar use. Pennies and an
occasional nickel have been tossed into the two upper pools--the
pools of the bird and the lizard--offerings in aid of wishes. But not
a one can be found in the third, where the skeleton resides.</TE>
<TE>   "We've been looking for ways to engage the public in the
discussion of water," says the MWD's vice president for external
affairs, Adan Ortega Jr., who began exploring the idea of a
competition last spring. "We had a notion that there is in Southern
California a common thread [in public art]" that could help in the
effort. Shortly thereafter, the agency sent out a call for
nominations for works related to water, and by September it had
received entries from art commissions and institutions as well as
individual artists and designers.</TE>
<TE>   The water district oversees the distribution of water from
Northern California and the Colorado River to parts of six
counties--from Ventura down to San Diego and from the Pacific to San
Bernardino--and nominations varied from the modest to the grandiose.
A third were quickly eliminated for technical reasons, such as not
being accessible to the public.</TE>
<TE>   Then the judges (one from each of the MWD counties except
Riverside; that judge had to drop out at the last minute) met.
Besides Gomez, the judges were Kerry Adams, public art supervisor for
the city of Ventura; John Lehrer, editor in chief of Westways
magazine; Felicia Shaw, program manager for the San Diego County
Commission for Arts and Culture; and Donald Wakefield, a San
Bernardino public artist.</TE>
<TE>   They met once, reviewing pictures and texts for each submission.
They scored the entries on four criteria--creativity and innovation,
impact, design, and accessibility. In the end, 20 made the cutoff.
Gomez says that some were clear favorites among all the judges;
others had to be debated.</TE>
<TE>   "There were some pieces that were very fun and splashy--they made
big statements," she says, referring to such pieces as Don Merkt's
28-foot-tall vase "Crossed Currents" in Culver City or Mark Lere's
outdoor fountain and installation, "The Five Senses," at California
Plaza in Ventura. "Then there were works that were quiet and
contemplative. Both types of work hold up equally
well--artistically--scale doesn't necessarily relate to interest."</TE>
<TE>   Later, photographs of the winners were commissioned, and the
result was organized as an exhibition and a book with a map to guide
people to each work. After the exhibition closes at Self-Help
Graphics, it goes to Comerica Bank and the Center for the Moving
Arts, both in San Diego, with more venues to be scheduled.</TE>
<TE>   Ten of the winning works are in L.A. County, and seven of those
are downtown. Most, not surprisingly, are fountains, although they
also integrate modern or postmodern art and ideas. These include the
Music Center Fountain by WET Design; the Paseo Cesar Chavez
Fountains, at the MTA Building on Alameda Street, by Elsa Flores,
Peter Shire, and Robert Gil de Montes; and "Source Figure," also at
Riordan Central Library, by Robert Graham.</TE>
<TE>   Choices from other counties also included public fountains, such
as "The Five Senses" by Lere and Richard Turner's "Wall-Gazing
Gallery" at Cal State Fullerton. A few serve practical as well as
artistic functions. In public art, said Tomas Benitez, director of
Self-Help Graphics, one can find attempts to match beauty with
utility. "This is where the best of that relationship is," Benitez
said, "where you have the architect or the designer compelled to
problem solve, and the artist interacting."</TE>
<TE>   Faced with designing a work meant to hold water in a
210,000-square-foot spillage area below a ridge of homes in San
Diego, Paul Hobson created a peanut-shaped pond, the bottom painted
in squares of blue and turquoise tones. "Viewage," built in 1997, is
easily the largest winner in Liquid Art. "It's an interesting
juxtaposition," Gomez says, "to be very quiet yet to be in such a
grand scale."</TE>
<TE>   In contrast, the smallest, though no less useful, winner is
"Exchanger Fountain" on tree-lined Lemon Street in Anaheim. The
drinking fountain designed by Buster Simpson is placed beside a
willow tree. Words are etched in a spiral inside the chrome-plated
basin, "Santa Ana your water nurtures and your hot winds cool. The
water kissing your lips is an offering." As the thirsty stop to
drink, the leftover water goes to the root of the tree.</TE>
<TE>   "I trust people are conscious of the offering they make: cooling
the next person's drink and nurturing the willow," Simpson says in
the "Liquid Art" book. "Reflected in the fountain is the water
'kissing your lips' and the interdependence of us all."</TE>
<TE>   Several winning entries involved references to water, but not the
actual substance. In San Diego, "Water Marks," by Lynn Susholtz and
Aida Mancillas, is a winding, 200-foot-long wall at the entrance to
Mission Trails Regional Park. It's covered with a mosaic of bronze
plaques, ceramic tiles, stone and colored concrete that make up a map
of the San Diego River. Merkt's "Crossed Currents" is a towering
stainless steel sculpture of a vase tipping into Ballona Creek in
Culver City, a creek that has long been encased in concrete. A single
giant drop of stainless steel "water" dangles from its rim. "My hope
is that in time these creeks will be allowed to be the sort that used
to flow through the city," Merkt has said. "I hope the piece
encourages people to pay attention to the creek, and to efforts to
restore and enhance it."</TE>
<TE>   Lynn Aldrich's "Blue Line Oasis" also refers to water without
using it. In 1994, she was commissioned by the MTA to design the
Artesia stop on the Blue Line. "They gave me the opportunity to study
the site and its history," she recalls. "I was interested in going
back to an earlier time, thinking about Artesia, which was named for
these wells that naturally bubble to the surface. I began to think of
them as a metaphor for urban experience.</TE>
<TE>   "You're really fortunate if you get excited about a public art
project," says Aldrich, who has dealt with water in her own art as
well. "There's a lot of research involved, and many artists feel
restricted because of the guidelines. I felt lucky it was a theme I
was really interested in engaging with."</TE>
<TE>   For reasons of maintenance, MTA stipulated that no water could be
used, so Aldrich constructed a simulation of a wishing well with a
low circular stone wall and, inside, ripples of water mimicked by
colored mosaic tiles. To extend that notion, she collected the wishes
of local schoolchildren for their community and inscribed them on
tiles set into a kiosk.</TE>
<TE>   Something else reminds visitors of the same tradition that
inspires donations to Fine's pools at the Riordan Central Library.
Aldrich has affixed a sprinkling of metal discs--her version of
coins--to the surface of the mosaic water.</TE>
<TE>   With a small laugh, she says, "Sometimes you find real pennies in
there."</TE>

<HD>In Search of a Truly American Film</HD>
<DH>The works that best reflect our values are probably not
what politicos have in mind.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEPHEN FARBER</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A few weeks after Sept. 11, Washington sent an emissary, Karl Rove,
to Hollywood to urge producers to make movies that champion American
values and enshrine the American spirit. Leaving aside the issue of
whether this kind of collaboration between government officials and
moviemakers is appropriate, there's another intriguing question to
ponder: What would a film bursting with "American values" actually
look like?</LD>
<LD>   Probably what the president and his advisors had in mind are films
that celebrate patriotism or wholesome attributes such as family
togetherness, self-sacrifice and courage under fire. But are any of
these upright virtues inherently American? At the risk of inviting
the wrath of the flag-wavers, I humbly suggest that America doesn't
have a monopoly on any of those qualities. They may represent the
ideals to which some Americans aspire, but these lofty goals are just
as likely to stir Aussies and Spaniards and Serbs.</LD>
<TE>   In light of this presidential request--although the White House
later made clear it wasn't trying to alter movie content--it's
tempting to look at a number of year-end movies to determine if any
of them discern traits unique to our culture. One obvious place to
start is with recent gung-ho war movies, such as "Black Hawk Down"
and "Behind Enemy Lines," that would probably be right at the top of
the government's wish list for suitably inspirational films in
perilous times.</TE>
<TE>   "Black Hawk Down" actually chronicles a less than triumphant U.S.
military mission--the U.S. involvement in the savage civil war in
Somalia in 1993 that included the deaths of 18 American servicemen
during a chaotic commando raid. The movie is particularly timely
right now, as it vividly conveys the disorientation of American
soldiers in a foreign terrain that is unfamiliar and
incomprehensible.</TE>
<TE>   Although it recognizes the horrors of modern warfare, it aims to
eulogize the courage and solidarity of the American fighting man.
These soldiers bravely thrust themselves into danger to rescue their
fallen comrades. Their fortitude is admirable, but is there anything
quintessentially American about the heroism that they exhibit? You
could probably find the same courage and loyalty among many other
people at war--the British and the Russians during World War II, the
Israelis, the Pushtun fighters in Afghanistan, just to name a few.
None of the Army Rangers in "Black Hawk Down" emerges as a distinctly
American hero, which is partly a failing of the script. Because the
individual soldiers are barely characterized and completely
undifferentiated, one searches in vain for any specifically American
traits.</TE>
<TE>   The Navy navigator played by Owen Wilson in "Behind Enemy Lines"
comes a little closer to filling the bill. He is sharply drawn in the
script as a slightly cynical, wisecracking maverick who thumbs his
nose at authority. His gumption serves him well under pressure; he
demonstrates a Yank's pragmatic resourcefulness when he's forced to
use his wits to survive the civil war in Bosnia.</TE>
<TE>   Both of these films mean to stir patriotic fervor. "The Majestic"
peddles a less bellicose brand of Americana. Set in the 1950s, much
of it takes place in an idyllic small town reminiscent of Bedford
Falls, the town immortalized in Frank Capra's "It's a Wonderful
Life." Director Frank Darabont wants to stir our nostalgia for the
fraternal, unselfish sense of community that sprouts in these
all-American enclaves.</TE>
<TE>   Is comradeship, however, a strictly American value? Small towns
where neighbors share each other's joys and sorrows can be found all
over the globe, and many foreign films, including Fellini's
"Amarcord," Zhang Yimou's "The Road Home" and the Irish comedy
"Waking Ned Devine" have focused on the same kinds of cohesive
communities that "The Majestic" glorifies.</TE>
<TE>   The last section of "The Majestic" shifts gears as it thrusts the
hero (Jim Carrey) back into Hollywood, where he is forced to testify
before a special session of the House Un-American Activities
Committee about his alleged Communist sympathies. His stay in
Smalltown USA has toughened his moral fiber, and the once sycophantic
screenwriter finds the pluck to stand up to the witch hunters and
champion the 1st Amendment. In the end, the movie advocates principle
over expediency, but this mealy-mouthed message is the most blandly
universal statement imaginable. "A Man for All Seasons" told a
similar story of a man defending conscience over compromise, and it
was set in England about 200 years before the American Revolution.</TE>
<TE>   "Black Hawk Down" and "The Majestic" are two insistently
"American" movies that end up telling us surprisingly little about
our unique spirit. If you dig a little deeper, you can find a couple
of current films that discover more penetrating truths about American
values.</TE>
<TE>   The critical prize-winner "In the Bedroom" is a very dark movie
unlikely to warm the cockles of a patriot's heart, but I think it
presents an indubitably American cautionary tale. Its sense of
locale--a sleepy Maine fishing village--is perfectly rendered, and it
captures the subtle class distinctions that infect our ostensibly
classless society.</TE>
<TE>   The story highlights the tension between an upper-middle-class
couple, the Fowlers (Tom Wilkinson and Sissy Spacek), and the
working-class woman (Marisa Tomei) having an affair with their son.
Part of the boy's reason for pursuing this liaison is to rankle his
parents, particularly his mom, who distrusts people outside their
refined universe. The couple's worst fears are realized when a
violent tragedy befalls their son.</TE>
<TE>   The film takes a disturbing turn in its final third. (Warning: The
following reveals some key plot elements.) The grieving, angry
parents, frustrated by the legal system, hatch a revenge plot that
mends their marriage. In the film's biting twist on a favorite
American maxim, the family that kills together stays together. It's
significant that in a key scene after their mission is accomplished,
director Todd Field makes a point of focusing on the American flag in
the couple's garage.</TE>
<TE>   Some viewers may argue with his thesis, but I think Field makes a
persuasive and terrifying case for the notion that vigilantism is an
irrepressible American impulse. We have long sanctified frontier
justice, and this is the credo the Fowlers uphold.</TE>
<TE>   No doubt this acerbic vision of our American heritage wasn't what
Rove had in mind when he came calling in Hollywood, but "In the
Bedroom" dramatizes some of the darkest strains in our culture, and
its vision is too potent to dismiss. I would prefer, however, to
conclude this survey of enduring American values on a somewhat more
positive note.</TE>
<TE>   "The Royal Tenenbaums," Wes Anderson's sprightly comedy about a
clan of failed geniuses, probably isn't the kind of uplifting
American hymn that Washington envisioned. It centers, after all, on a
ragingly dysfunctional family. Nevertheless, the movie touched me
because it made me think about the precious qualities of our society
that might well be threatened by terrorist attacks as well as by
governmental overreaction.</TE>
<TE>   The Tenenbaums are a family of eccentrics--wackos, weirdos,
loners, con men and rogues. The film requests our indulgence and our
affection for this motley group, and I would propose that such
open-mindedness epitomizes America at its best. Anderson's picture is
a valentine to defiant, unregenerate individuality.</TE>
<TE>   Extremist, fundamentalist regimes want to create societies where
everyone is a clone or a drone marching to the same insistent
drummer. Such regimes mandate sameness, and I think what they hate
about America is that we are such a dizzyingly diverse population--a
society of lunatics and lovers of every persuasion. In the spirit of
this polyglot, polymorphously perverse ethos, Anderson makes room for
almost every sexual and ethnic possibility within the extended
Tenenbaum clan. An African American, an Indian (from Calcutta), an
angry Jewish paranoiac, a woman who's dabbled in bisexuality, even a
quasi-incestuous couple all reside under the same roof.</TE>
<TE>   Despite their conflicts and neuroses, the Tenenbaums and their
consorts ultimately arrive at a state of understanding and harmony.
They display solidarity amid astonishing diversity, and I came out of
this film feeling grateful that I live in a society that could
tolerate this much antic nonconformity. "The Royal Tenenbaums"
doesn't have a political bone in its body, but in its unassuming way,
it may contain the truest and most heartening embodiment of the
messy, vital American spirit that you can find on movie screens
today.</TE>

<HD>A List Without Borders</HD>
<DH>In territory ignored by most critics, this top 10 sticks to
artists who know who they are.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>AGUSTIN GURZA</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>For all the talk about global culture, pop music continues to be a
relatively segregated pastime. On year-end top-10 lists for 2001,
critics still skewed toward rock and rap and rumba, with remarkably
little overlap.</LD>
<LD>   My list, for example, is entirely Latin. That may seem limited to
some, but an entire musical universe falls under that umbrella. Salsa
alone could consume a critic full time, not to mention other genres,
from mariachi to rock en espanol.</LD>
<LD>   With so much music from so many countries, who has time for
Britney Spears? I admit, I was clueless about most of the albums
picked by my colleagues as the year's best. Even Bob Dylan, a
longtime personal favorite, got a cursory spin on my turntable after
I picked up the vinyl version of his new album, "Love and Theft,"
which seemed to be every critic's favorite.</LD>
<TE>   Bias? Sure, but by specialty. I wouldn't presume to say where
Dylan should place on the musical spectrum of 2001, although I may
have been able to do it for 1971, when my English-Spanish listening
ratio was reversed. Today, when it comes to mainstream American pop
music, I may as well be tuned in to Radio Kabul.</TE>
<TE>   For similar reasons, I presume, Latin music ranked only sparingly
on mainstream critics' lists. Not a single one of my 10 choices was
shared by the 14 writers who voted in the Times' annual pop music
poll, a result that can make you feel like you live in a parallel
universe.</TE>
<TE>   Predictably, Latin artists who popped up on top 10s here and
there--singer Marc Anthony in Time magazine or Buena Vista bassist
Cachaito Lopez in the New York Times--tended to be those who benefit
from strong crossover publicity.</TE>
<TE>   But while such artists may be the best known outside the
Spanish-speaking world, they're not necessarily the best choices
within it.</TE>
<TE>   I don't really believe in lists, although I love reading them. How
can you say a great salsa album outranks a great mariachi one? I'd be
hard-pressed to defend why I put one album at No. 6 and another at
No. 9, and not the other way around.</TE>
<TE>   But I'd have no trouble defending the list itself. I chose works
in various genres for their creativity and individuality, by artists
sure of who they are and what they want to say. Those who try to be
something they're not--diluting their cultural character or switching
to English to sell more records--get beaucoup demerits in my book.</TE>
<TE>   My favorites are all proudly rooted in their distinct cultures,
but not confined by them. Many offer a glimpse into other worlds,
like the harsh borderlands between Mexico and the U.S. explored by
Lila Downs in her stark and startling album, "Border/La Linea."</TE>
<TE>   Another pick, by the salsa-folk trio Servando, Sandino y
Florentino, offers strong social commentary from a different part of
the continent. These young Venezuelans have crafted sterling new
arrangements for the '60s-era protest songs written by their father,
the late Ali Primera. They may look like just another superficial,
pretty-boy band, but they breathed new life into their father's
still-relevant social concerns.</TE>
<TE>   One of the great rewards of this job is the discovery of new
music. By far my most exciting find of the year was Pedro Guerra, a
singer-songwriter from Tenerife in the Canary Islands who already has
a handful of albums in Spain. His latest release, the lovely and
spiritual "Ofrenda," was lost in the shuffle of Latin Grammy
nominations this year. It didn't win in the male pop vocal category,
but the title cut was included in a Grammy compilation CD, where it
captured my ear with its fresh acoustic sound and joyful melody.</TE>
<TE>   Guerra's song is a tender, uplifting tune about welcoming home
spirits with offerings on the Day of the Dead, a custom he discovered
in Oaxaca, Mexico. He also writes in an engrossing, personal way
about the street children of Rio and Mexico City, the plight of
unwanted immigrants (in a song  spiked with Middle Eastern music),
and the paralyzing power of fear. It's an inspiring, hopeful work,
which I ranked No. 1.</TE>
<TE>   My list leans heavily toward the music I know the best: salsa, and
the sub-genre I like the best, Cuban salsa.</TE>
<TE>   Four Cubans made my list: Issac Delgado, Carlos Manuel, Cesar
Pedroso and Charanga Habanera. But Havana is so charged with creative
energy there could have been twice as many. Unlike the tired,
formulaic salsa acts we get from New York these days, the Cubans each
have their own style and point of view. What they share is the Cuban
compulsion to be different and better than before.</TE>
<TE>   I confess an affirmative-action attitude in trying to include acts
from Mexico, my native country. But aside from Downs, it wasn't easy
to do and maintain integrity. Mexican pop music is in a dismal
condition, and its rich folkloric forms are either being neglected or
turned into cheap retreads of the glory days. Still, mariachi singer
Pepe Aguilar sticks to his guns, offering a set of polished new
rancheras distinguished by their craft and good taste.</TE>
<TE>   Jorge Moreno, a young Cuban American from Miami, is the only
U.S.-based act on my list. This singer-songwriter has come up with a
seamless, bicultural fusion of Afro-Cuban salsa, melodic '60s pop and
even a little '50s calypso. His sound is a fresh pop contribution
from the Latino immigrant community in this country, which very
rarely delivers anything original in the way of Latin music.</TE>
<TE>   My list is weak on rock en espanol, a field I'm learning on the
job. I agree with those who believe this is one of the most promising
areas of Latin music, despite limited sales. The best, like Jarabe de
Palo from Spain, fuse a rebellious, even jaundiced rock attitude with
their native styles. This Catalan quintet, for example, blends echoes
of Dire Straits with strains of Jamaican reggae, Colombian vallenato
and Congolese soukous.</TE>
<TE>   Which brings us back to global culture. In a line that could apply
to pop music as well as human affairs, Jarabe de Palo affirms that
"there is no future in being pure, because true purity is in the
mix."</TE>
<TE>   The message has even more power in the song's rhyming, rhythmic
Spanish. See if you can hear it:</TE>
<TE>   En lo puro no hay futuro/la pureza esta en la mezcla.</TE>

<HD>A Role She Tried to Refuse</HD>
<DH>Zoe Caldwell had to be coaxed into writing a memoir on the
early lessons that shaped her acting.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>IRENE LACHER</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>None of "my men," as Zoe Caldwell calls her family, has buttons on
anything he wears. That's because one of the world's great stage
actresses can't sew them on. Numbers are a problem for Caldwell too.
They simply don't add up.</LD>
<LD>   "I just disregard maths. I don't take into consideration numbers,
and that has been a good way to get rid of it," crows the
Australian-born actress.</LD>
<LD>   So when a prominent New York book editor called and asked if she
would write a memoir, Caldwell politely declined, saying her learning
disability would make that quite impossible. "I don't even write
letters," she told him, "but thank you for asking me."</LD>
<TE>   Bob Weil, W.W. Norton's executive editor, wasn't so easily
dissuaded. What he had in mind was not your monthly book club, "womb
to tomb" memoir. He had proposed Caldwell as a candidate for last
year's Norton Lectures, a prestigious, 3-year-old collaboration
between the publishing house and the New York Public Library. The
first two lectures were given by Random House editor and "Book
Business" author Jason Epstein and Yale European history professor
emeritus Peter Gay, who also oversees the series. And now the Norton
Lectures powers that be had set their sights on Caldwell.</TE>
<TE>   "It was my idea," Weil says. "I think she's our preeminent stage
actress. And I felt that she had a story to tell that could inspire
and influence people. I said, 'Either it will come out of you in a
torrent and you'll realize you can do it, or you'll understand you
can't.'"</TE>
<TE>   She could and she did. Caldwell, 68, just disregarded her mild
dyslexia and problems with certain motor skills, and wrote her early
life story by longhand. Last fall, she delivered the lectures, which
Norton recently published in a pocket-size volume titled "I Will Be
Cleopatra: An Actress's Journey."</TE>
<TE>   London critic Benedict Nightingale applauded her voyage in the New
York Times, comparing Caldwell's writing to her acting, which he
calls "hugely versatile yet always lucid." That sentiment is echoed
on the back cover by other aristocrats of the theater, such as Arthur
Miller and Terrence McNally, who writes that the memoir is "exactly
like her acting: clean, direct and magnificent." McNally wrote the
role of Maria Callas in "Master Class" for Caldwell, who won a Tony,
her fourth, for her acclaimed performance after creating the
character at the Mark Taper Forum in Los Angeles in 1995.</TE>
<TE>   That production went on to New York, and during that time,
Caldwell bonded with soprano Audra McDonald, whom she calls "our
Sophie," referring to her role as one of Callas' students in "Master
Class." "She was extraordinary," Caldwell says. "They were all
extraordinary. I didn't go on to London because they weren't going on
to London, and I said, 'I'm not going without them.' I'm no fool.
They made it so easy.</TE>
<TE>   "Well, Audra and I became like...." She pauses, searching for the
right word. "She's got a terrific mum, a perfectly good mum of her
own, so we didn't become mother and daughter, but we sure became very
close. And she has a little girl called Zoe. Zo, she calls her."</TE>
<TE>   That's what Caldwell's intimates call her. It rhymes with "dough"
although, on paper, it's spelled Zoe. Her family came up with the
nickname to distinguish her from her mother, also named Zoe
(pronounced Zo-ee). "[Zo] always seemed like a cozy name, and if
anyone said Zo-ee, I was, ohhh what have I done now?"</TE>
<TE>   For Caldwell, Callas was a landmark role, but Cleopatra was a
watershed. She says that when she played Shakespeare's heroine
opposite Christopher Plummer in a 1967 production of "Antony and
Cleopatra" in Ontario, Canada, she emerged from the experience fully
formed as an artist and a woman. That's why Cleopatra gets top
billing in the memoir. And there the story ends.</TE>
<TE>   "She demanded more of me than I'd ever had demanded of me before,"
Caldwell says, "and therefore she demanded that I break certain
bounds and bonds, and be prepared to dare more and feel safe in the
daring. And I just knew that that's when I thought, 'Oh, gosh, this
is how I'll be as an actress.' And Robert [Whitehead, her husband]
had come into my life, so the two things came together, as a woman
and as an actress, the formation of both."</TE>
<TE>   That's where Caldwell put down her pen, because Weil's assignment
had been to focus on the part of her life that constituted "the
makings of a great stage actress," the editor says.</TE>
<TE>   "At what point did you just realize you had it? My inspiration was
Eudora Welty's 'One Writer's Beginnings,' and I felt Zoe is
comparable as an actress. Those who know stage acting know there's no
one better in America today. I was interested in what in her
childhood gave us the clues. If you're crazy enough to consider a
career in the arts, what do you need to know? I felt that Zoe would
be a splendid person to guide you."</TE>
<TE>   Caldwell is certainly "actressy," but in the best--and possibly
rarest--sense of the word. Some actors take up all the oxygen in a
room, turning other people into an ad hoc audience. In contrast,
Caldwell gently demands participation, punctuating many of her
declarations with the invitation, "Don't you think?" She's warm,
expressive and self-effacing. As she arrives at the little Italian
cafe across the street from her pied-a-terre in the theater district
(she and Whitehead live in Pound Ridge, N.Y.), she embraces the owner
like a long-lost relative. Today, she's simply dressed in a black
shirt and pants. Her short shock of gray hair is well cut but
obliviously tousled, and her face appears free of makeup except for
smudges of kohl dramatizing her eyes.</TE>
<TE>   As she speaks, her hands paint elaborate air pictures, never
tracing the same pattern twice. Describing a role, she sometimes
gazes off into the distance as if she's observing her character anew
on some invisible plane. Theatrical, to be sure, but one gets the
sense that that's genuinely who she is, not someone she wants you to
see.</TE>
<TE>   Caldwell was a Depression baby in Melbourne, Australia, the
daughter of a taxi dancer and a spunky plumber who believed Sundays
were best spent attending vaudeville, opera, plays and musicals
rather than church. "He felt ... that theater allowed all your senses
full rein and church, as he knew it, reined them in," she writes.</TE>
<TE>   Caldwell grew up seeing every performer who came to Melbourne. She
writes that she bought tickets for "the gods,"  the cheapest seats,
where "packers" with padded brooms crammed theatergoers into the
least space possible. At age 9, she made her professional stage debut
as Slightly Soiled, one of the lost boys in "Peter Pan." She soon
moved on to radio serials and, briefly, an ultimately misguided
attempt to work at a pickle factory under an assumed name, "a part
that I seemed born to play."</TE>
<TE>   At 19, Caldwell joined Australia's oldest professional theater
company, the Union Theatre Repertory Company (now the Melbourne
Theatre Company), where she met the "wicked, smart as a whip, and
infuriating" Barry Humphries, who had already created "Mrs. Edna
Everage from Humoresque Street," or Dame Edna. Humphries, then "thin
as a pin," liked to pretend he was spastic when he walked down the
street so he could see how much pity he could summon in other people.</TE>
<TE>   Six years later, Caldwell had a contract with the Shakespeare
Memorial Theatre in Stratford-on-Avon in England, where she worked
with Laurence Olivier, Charles Laughton, Ian Holm, Paul Robeson and
Sam Wanamaker. That experience set the stage for a career that
spanned three continents.</TE>
<TE>   Caldwell's memoir is peppered with casual references to the
remarkable theater talents who have populated her life, such as
"Tony"--either Richardson or Tyrone Guthrie--and "Hume and Jess," the
distinguished acting couple Hume Cronyn and the late Jessica Tandy,
who kept fixing her up with Cronyn's first cousin, theatrical
producer-director Robert Whitehead, until it stuck. In the book,
Edith Evans passes on her pre-curtain tip for ensuring the whitest
hands--hold them up to drain them of blood. Caldwell also writes
candidly about playwrights whose work she performed, those she liked
(such as Tennessee Williams) and those she didn't (Eugene Ionesco).</TE>
<TE>   Of the elegiac Williams, she says she didn't actually work with
him when she performed in his play "Slapstick Tragedy," for which she
won her first Tony in 1966 even though the run lasted a mere 10 days.
(She also won Tonys for playing the title roles in "The Prime of Miss
Jean Brodie" in 1968 and "Medea" in 1982.)</TE>
<TE>   "He was there every day, but by the time he was at the theater, he
was gone." She discreetly declines to elaborate. "But I did work with
him, because I worked with his script. I didn't need the actual
person, because I had the whole essence of him in the script. I love
him because he's a poet. He's an artist--and I use that word very
rarely. He shows us his vision of something, and forever afterward we
then see his vision."</TE>
<TE>   Ionesco doesn't get such rave reviews. Caldwell got to know the
existentialist playwright when she performed in his play "Jacques" as
a bride with three noses.</TE>
<TE>   "He was a little, round drunken man," she says. "He had a very
Parisienne, tiny, tiny wife, much makiage [makeup] very, very, very
French and very bossy and trying to keep him in order. And I just
didn't understand what it was all about. The plays. I really didn't.
But that was the next job I was offered, so I took it. He hasn't
lasted. It was the Theater of the Absurd. The things that really last
continually tell about the human condition combating whatever--the
political and social madness that is abounding. I think the
playwriting that's coming out of this time should be very thrilling,
don't you?"</TE>
<TE>   Another famous name that surfaces in the memoir is Albert Finney,
with whom she had an affair, breaking her own rule never to date an
actor she was working with. "The marvelous thing about sleeping with
somebody is that you've got all sorts of secret things that nobody
else knows about, just you two for the period of the affair," she
says. "So they're bound to come onstage, those secret, secret things.
And you're there giving secret signals. The audience doesn't know
anything about that, the rest of the actors don't know anything about
that, and the thrilling thing about theater is to let the audience in
on everything. You can act the hell out of the first time, but it
doesn't work, because there's already a knowledge."</TE>
<TE>   In the book, she keeps most of their secrets secret. She writes
that she met Finney in a 1959 production of "Othello" in England.
They apparently bonded over a steaming bowl of eucalyptus when the
actor was forced to battle his cold so he could step in for Olivier,
who couldn't perform in "Coriolanus" because he'd damaged his knee
tap dancing. Initially, Caldwell doesn't identify Finney as the actor
for whom she broke her own rule, writing only: "I had an explosive
affair with an actor in the company, causing a lot of havoc and pain,
for which I apologize." Later in the book, she acknowledges that she
was served papers in Finney's divorce proceedings.</TE>
<TE>   Caldwell says she deliberately shied away from the kiss-and-tell
genre. "I can't bear people talking about their 'and then I slept and
went to the Riviera with blah blah blah.' Who cares? That's for
gossip columnists. But I did want to make the point clear that I did
a lot of damage, because he was married and had a little year-old
boy, and I broke up the marriage. I didn't want to say all that, but
I thought I'd tell them so that the book doesn't end with people
saying, 'I wonder who it was she had an affair with.' I tell them in
a way that makes me look like a fool."</TE>
<TE>   To say that Caldwell is invested in her craft is like saying
Rapunzel had long hair. When she made her Broadway debut as a
disabled nun in John Whiting's "The Devils," she prepped for the part
by walking around town mimicking curvature of the spine. To play Lord
Horatio Nelson's zaftig mistress Emma Hamilton in a London production
of Terrence Rattigan's "A Bequest to the Nation," she shot up to 180
pounds, piling the weight on her slight, 5-foot-21/2-inch frame. And
when she writes about her characters, she describes them in much the
same way she describes real people.</TE>
<TE>   "I really believe they should have a history and you should really
know their history very well, because then they're a whole person to
you," she says. "Otherwise what you play is an evil person or a good
person. It's not up to you to make that decision. Playwrights make
that decision by the way they write the character. What you've got to
do is find the character and show him. When Laurence Olivier was
playing Iago, Tony Guthrie came back to see him, and Larry said, 'I
really loathe him.' And Tony Guthrie said, 'You shouldn't be playing
him then, should you?'"</TE>
<TE>   Such intensity isn't easy to leave at the stage door. Caldwell
writes that it took her six months to regain her sense of self after
Cleopatra.</TE>
<TE>   "That's what it takes every role now," she says. "I mean Jean
Brodie took a long, long time. Medea took a long time to just get
back--this sounds so corny, artsy--but if you give all of
yourself--it happens in life too--if you give all of yourself to a
person and they move away, they take what you've given them with
them. Then who are you?"</TE>
<TE>   Caldwell acknowledges that her deep immersion in her roles has
sometimes been hard on her husband and children, Sam, 32, a theater
critic, and Charlie, 29, an aspiring theater producer. "Kids, dogs,
husbands, they all know when you take yourself away," Caldwell says.
"You can be saying, 'How was school?' But actually they know that you
don't give a damn. What you're really concerned with is something to
do with whoever the character is."</TE>
<TE>   These days Caldwell is on hiatus from the theater while she spends
time with her theatrical family, but she isn't planning on writing
about them again. She says there won't be a second act for her
memoirs. The final chapter is finished. The end.</TE>
<TE>   Says Caldwell: "Very few people knew about volume one. Everybody
knows about volume two. They know all the pieces that have been in
all the magazines. I would like to keep writing, just about people.
Not me." She laughs. "I've written about me."</TE>

<LD>As a former Afghanistan resident (Peace Corps, Jalalabad, 1971-73)
and film buff, I was generally delighted by Dan Baggott's article
"From Afghanistan With Love" (Dec. 30) but disappointed by its
failure to mention "The Beast," directed by Kevin Reynolds, one of
the best of the bunch.</LD>
<LD>   This was a mid-'80s drama set during the Afghan-Soviet war, and
depicting a sadistic Red Army tank commander and his efforts to
extricate himself and his men from an impossible position behind
enemy lines. The film was shot in Israel, the bleaker parts of which
credibly stood in for the Pushtun countryside.</LD>
<LD>   Anyone exploring the subgenre of "Afghans in the movies" should
view it.</LD>

<LD>I was rather shocked to read Steve Hochman and Jeff Leeds' "Pop Eye"
column concerning the pronounced fall in album sales between 2000 and
2001 (Dec. 30) and not cite the Internet as a significant factor.
C'mon guys, get a clue!</LD>
<LD>   For the first time in 35 years I did not buy a single new album
last year; however, I downloaded close to 1,000 songs, including
complete new albums by Bob Dylan, Andrea Bocelli and New Order.</LD>
<LD>   And although I did not buy a single playable CD, I did buy 100
blank ones, a CD burner, and 75 jewel cases and labels. Duh--guess
what I'm doing?</LD>
<TE>   Oh, and there are another 20 million to 30 million people like me
out there. Do the math.</TE>

<LD>I find it disheartening that Times film critic Kenneth Turan has
crowned "The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring" as his
No. 1 film of the year ("The Year the Studios Let Us Down," Dec. 23).</LD>
<LD>   When Joe Morgenstern got equally effusive for the Wall Street
Journal along with Bob Mondello on NPR, and critics at Time and
Entertainment Weekly also raved on, I thought: "Why can't a media
behemoth make a really great work of cinematic art?"</LD>
<LD>   As I sat in mute horror at "Fellowship's" dreck, I realized two
important points about the age of convergence: (1) Respectable
critics can and will be bought. (2) Media conglomerates producing
cross-platformed $350-million film trilogies are to culture (and
critics) what chainsaws are to rain forests.</LD>
<TE>   I counted four commercials and four New Line trailers preceding
the film. Twenty minutes of advertising in front of a three-hour
movie. This alienating experience wasn't mentioned in Turan's review.
Perhaps he and other cheering critics enjoyed private screenings.
Critics who won't comment upon the state of delivery, the excessive
cross-platforming or the creep of advertising into the overall
cinematic experience are no longer valid to my experience of movies.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike with "Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone," if just one
esteemed reviewer had railed that the emperor had no clothes,
millions of the public's hard-earned dollars could have been saved
from AOL Time Warner's portfolio.</TE>
<TE>   When critics endorse rather than decry heinous, calculated media
franchises, and put down small, philosophical films with interesting
design strategies, as Kevin Thomas did when he trashed "Waking Life,"
something terrible is happening in our culture and in our lives and
in our newspapers.</TE>
<TE>   For example, KCET (PBS) slots automotive and computer ads between
all programming. Every channel click in Adelphia's digital cable
($50-plus a month) kicks up an ad banner in the lower left corner.
Yahoo and other Internet search engines "search" according to who has
paid to place, and public radio station KCRW constantly uses product
placement, whether it's a free iPod (Apple) or the three-hour
Saturday slot it gives to Spinner.com (AOL Time Warner).</TE>
<TE>   An epidemic of monopolized culture is wiping out the arts before
our very eyes--and no one is talking.</TE>
<TE>   We need our own Frodo to fight the dark forces of commercialized
culture. The pen and the lens are mightier than the sword. As the
dragon creeps in the wood, our "critics" should at least shout
"Dragon!" But when the critic is served from a can, so is the
culture.</TE>

<LD>I recently went to the Hollywood &amp; Highland complex and was generally
pleased. I thought the theaters in the multiplex (at least the one I
attended) were terrific--the stadium seating, the room to cross my
legs and allow easy passage of others.</LD>
<LD>   I didn't even mind the $9.50 price tag for the comfort and good
sound.</LD>
<LD>   However, the parking situation is outrageous: $1 for the first two
hours with validation and $1 for every 20 minutes after that. It cost
$8 to park.</LD>
<TE>   None of the other complexes in town resorts to that sort of
highway robbery. The AMC in Century City gives you four hours of
parking with validation to cover the length of most films.</TE>
<TE>   At Hollywood &amp; Highland, the situation tempts many people to park
on nearby residential streets, making parking in front of your own
home impossible.</TE>
<TE>   I understand that employees must also pay full freight ($10) for
daily parking and have also taken to the streets, compounding the
already congested parking problems in the neighborhood.</TE>
<TE>   The complex must reduce the fees so that people are encouraged to
park in the structure and not on the residential streets.</TE>

<LD>My question to "Armageddon" screenwriter Jonathan Hensleigh is not
why he chose to throw up in his car after the person "very

"Yeah, wasn't it cool the way the [plane hitting the building was
similar to] the asteroids hitting the buildings in 'Armageddon'"
("Rethinking Their Life's Work," Dec. 23).</LD>
<LD>   Rather, why didn't Mr. Hensleigh simply vomit directly in this
miscreant's face?</LD>

<LD>I enjoyed the story about that new opera, Richard Wagner's "Ring"
cycle ("A Pause in the 'Ring' Cycle," by Jan Breslauer, Dec. 30).</LD>
<LD>   With so much space devoted to specially effected artists at
Industrial Light &amp; Magic, I expect a computer graphic imagery
blockbuster capitalizing on the success of "The Lord of the Rings"
and giving new meaning to the term "playing at selected theaters"
since unnamed co-producers plan to build a $400-million joint to show
it in their city. Some $60 million in production costs seems tame,
and should provide lots of cute little mythical characters, much like
Bilbo, Frodo, Pippin and Arwen together with a warm fuzzy story line
guaranteed to give a chuckle to kids of all ages. Definitely PG-13.</LD>
<LD>   Nothing in the article mentioned who would write the music. I
envision something dramatic yet tender, portentous yet fulfilling.
Maybe each character could have its own theme music. Hello, John
Williams! And who is this Richard Wagner anyway? Did he write the
opera or something? What has he done lately?</LD>

<DH>Home-based technology may be the shape of things to come,
but Starbucks patrons prove human connection won't become obsolete.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BRIAN LOWRY</AU>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Breathless prognostication has emanated for years from both the
entertainment industry's slide rule and Armani suit contingents, all
about how technology is going to change our media-consuming lives in
wondrous and, perhaps, terrifying ways.</LD>
<LD>   For ink-stained wretches who toil in print, or those who still
like the feel of a newspaper in their hands, these forecasts have
primarily fallen into the terrifying category, which brings to mind
the "Twilight Zone" episode in which people are deemed obsolete.</LD>
<LD>   Based on anecdotal observations, however, the tyranny of
technology may not overwhelm us as quickly as anticipated; in fact,
there is ample evidence in any average neighborhood that things may
not be changing quite as fast as we have been led to believe.</LD>
<TE>   Or, put another way, God bless Starbucks.</TE>
<TE>   That's right, the company that made the world safe for $3 coffee
drinks and taught America to speak an elaborate language more complex
to the uninitiated than Urdu (tall equals small? Grande is medium?)
is but one of the venues offering a beacon of hope for those who
aren't quite ready for all their existing low-tech diversions to go
the way of the buggy whip.</TE>
<TE>   At the root of this paranoia is the less-than-charitable
assumption that younger generations have no patience for reading
newspapers, and prefer to garner information--assuming, that is, they
care a whit about anyone's problems but their own--from television
and the Internet. Weaned on video games and MTV, these soda-swilling
creatures possess the attention spans of mosquitoes, we have been
told, and demand the kind of instant gratification served up only
online. No wonder the 24-hour news channels' screens have become
busier than the Hollywood Freeway at rush hour, running scrolls of
information across, down and sideways.</TE>
<TE>   Admittedly, Starbucks isn't a place where everybody knows your
name, but its every-other-corner locations (nearly 4,000 of them in
the U.S. alone) represent gathering spots where people young and old
can be seen poring over the newspaper every morning, staring at
articles in a manner that can only imply they are actually reading
them.</TE>
<TE>   Although this might not sound like cause for celebration, that
simple act shouldn't be taken for granted. Consider that these
Starbucks patrons leave their houses when they could more
inexpensively make their own coffee and buy (or bring with them) a
newspaper they could just as easily read at home.</TE>
<TE>   Although there is a dearth of hard data to underscore how
Starbucks fits into people's hunger for social interaction, the
Seattle-based chain clearly welcomes the notion of providing
customers with such a haven.</TE>
<TE>   "That's what Starbucks is about, that experience," says Mark
Sacks, publications product manager for the company. "It is sort of
an oasis in the middle of the day. We want people to come in and sit
and enjoy their newspapers."</TE>
<TE>   A spokesman for the Long Beach-based Specialty Coffee Assn. of
America says its members (including Starbucks) paint an equally
encouraging picture.</TE>
<TE>   "Everybody's reporting that business is good, if not better, than
last year at this time, saying the shops are full," says Mike
Ferguson, marketing director for the association, which represents
various links in the coffee food chain, including 10,000 to 12,000
retailers across the U.S.</TE>
<TE>   Cynics, of course, might say coffeehouses have simply supplanted
bars as a socially acceptable spot for singles (and marrieds who
behave like singles) to people-watch, socialize and seek
companionship. At least one screenwriter friend admits having spent
many an hour during his single years conspicuously reading or writing
scripts in coffee shops, hoping to catch the attention of actress
wannabes.</TE>
<TE>   Still, the coffee ritual is only one of the rebuttals to
techno-geeks waxing poetic about how this device or that is going to
fundamentally alter our way of life. After that grande latte with
light foam, for example, pop into Blockbuster Video around 5 p.m. any
Saturday to pick up a new movie release and witness the lines around
the store.</TE>
<TE>   Now think about that for a moment, and remember that a majority of
homes now have access to pay-per-view, allowing consumers to punch up
movies from the comfort of their living rooms without having to
jostle with the unwashed masses and wait for the teenager behind the
counter to scan their cards. Besides, aren't we all hurtling toward
the rapturous day when the pipeline into the home is wide enough to
turn our TV into a video jukebox, spewing out movies like a pitching
machine?</TE>
<TE>   For years, that has been the image of the future: a place where
consumers enjoy fingertip control of entertainment options without
needing to sit upright, much less leave the house. In essence, it's
the next step beyond a memorable episode of "Friends" in which
Chandler and Joey perched themselves in side-by-side BarcaLoungers
and tried to see how long they could stay there without moving.</TE>
<TE>   Harvard University political scientist Robert Putnam crystallized
this point in a much-quoted 1995 article, "Bowling Alone," which in
part blamed television and the Internet for a decline in bowling
leagues and civic organizations. It posited that modern technology
was prompting a reduction in public interaction, as people
increasingly "privatize" their leisure time. "Cocooning" became the
popular term for this phenomenon--one that has been frequently
repeated as pundits contemplated whether people would withdraw into
their homes as a response, consciously or not, to the events of Sept.
11.</TE>
<TE>   Those crowded coffeehouses, however, along with super-sized
bookstores such as Barnes &amp; Noble, reflect a somewhat different
paradigm--one driven by the social impulse to spend time among
people, even if it's only to sit quietly reading and observing
others.</TE>
<TE>   David Halle, a UCLA professor of sociology and director of the
LeRoy Neiman Center for the Study of American Society and Culture,
points out that, with its comfortable chairs and cozy environment,
Starbucks invites people to settle in for longer than it takes to
gulp down a cup of coffee. "It's part of their formula and part of
their success, I think," Halle says.</TE>
<TE>   Although Halle doesn't dispute Putnam's premise about the strong
tug of technology to keep us at home, he suggests there is a
countervailing force that has been somewhat underestimated--namely,
the urge to see and experience people.</TE>
<TE>   In short, while the public may indeed possess more incentives to
spend leisure time perched in front of the computer or big-screen TV,
Halle suggests, "it makes sense, from that point of view, to see some
kind of reaction against it. I think you have both [trends] happening
at once.... There's definitely a tussle going on."</TE>
<TE>   Along those lines, a recently issued UCLA study reinforced in part
that people resist shedding old habits, finding that Internet users
don't abandon traditional media but simply consume more of it than
nonusers in general, with nearly 80% in both camps reporting that
they read newspapers.</TE>
<TE>   To be clear, it should be understood these observations aren't
being brought to you by someone who endorses a Luddite lifestyle or
advocates tossing one's TV out the window. In fact, they actually
come from a dedicated couch potato (with sour cream and chives) who
spends too much time worshiping at the shrine of ESPN and lovingly
refers to his TiVo personal video recorder as if it were another
family member.</TE>
<TE>   That said, it is reassuring, not only for selfish reasons, to see
people venturing into public spaces and rubbing elbows with their
neighbors. Just as it's nice to be reminded that the love of reading
has not been lost--as the legions of moppets devouring "Harry Potter"
books demonstrates--and that there is still room for a somewhat
broader view of the world than a crawl across the bottom of a TV
screen can provide.</TE>
<TE>   So maybe there really is cause for a wisp of optimism among many
who saw the "obsolete" label descending upon them. Maybe the
technological deluge won't require completely sweeping the dinosaurs
from the land to make room for the next rung on the evolutionary
ladder. And if you happen to be at Starbucks, surrounded by strangers
and lazily sipping a caramel macchiato as you read this, hey, more
power to you.</TE>

<HD>Whistling Sweetly in the Dark</HD>
<DH>Despite a string of successes, the young soprano Virginia
Tola still battles her fears when she steps onstage.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DONNA PERLMUTTER</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Some young singers with talent and the bookings to prove it luxuriate
in confidence. Then there's Virginia Tola.</LD>
<LD>   No matter that the budding Argentine soprano was picked by
Frederica von Stade from a crowd of students, then handed over to
Placido Domingo, who cleared her path to major opera stages. No
matter that she has won some big competition prizes and captured wide
attention. No matter that within two years she has gone from novice
to sharing the spotlight with celebrated singers--notably making her
American debut in Los Angeles Opera's just-ended "Merry Widow," and
performing at last year's Kennedy Center Honors in a tribute number
to Domingo.</LD>
<LD>   "For me it's all very difficult," says the tall, runway-slender
Tola in halting English, speaking about her secondary role as
Valencienne in Franz Lehar's "Widow." "There was much worry for me
about the debut and how to keep my mind on all these things: dance,
sing, speak English dialogue, act.</LD>
<TE>   "Also, I know that if I can't take this concentration I'll do
something wrong. I have to work with every word so people will
understand what I say and what I sing. You see, Virginia has many
chances to err. But not Valencienne. So I must put the role in every
part of my body. And if I do my job well, I protect Virginia. Only
it's very hard to change back and forth between Valencienne and
Virginia."</TE>
<TE>   Tola, in a pink woolly turtleneck and slim beige pants, wears not
a lick of makeup. She turns 26 in mid-January yet could easily pass
for a college freshman. As she sits in an office of the Los Angeles
Opera, her manner is earnest and animated, turning shy on occasion. A
translator sits at the table assisting her now and then with a word
or phrase.</TE>
<TE>   She will add to her worries with appearances at tonight's pricey
L.A. Opera gala fund-raiser and Tuesday's "Night of Zarzuela &amp;
Operetta With Placido Doming &amp; Friends," although in both instances,
the showcase format, rather than the full-on drama of a staged opera
(especially one in English), eases her anxieties. For both events,
Tola will contribute operetta arias and excerpts from zarzuelas, the
Spanish-language music-theater form that is one of Domingo's
passions. And in both cases, she will share the stage with the tenor,
something she has been doing a lot of lately--and that, she says, all
but cancels out qualms.</TE>
<TE>   "He makes everything easy for those around him," she says. "In
romantic duets he makes me feel that I am the love of his life. His
commitment is so intense. He gives 100%. And that makes you know what
you have to do: Give back at his level."</TE>
<TE>   It all began for Virginia Tola on a farm in Santa Fe, Argentina,
about an hour out of Buenos Aires.</TE>
<TE>   "No one sings," she says of her engineer-agronomist father and
teacher-administrator mother and two younger sisters--although a
grandmother, who heads a piano conservatory, continually pushed her
to practice as a child and "was my connection to music." Asked at
what age she decided to be a singer, she replies, as though surprised
that anyone would wonder, "when I was born, you know," but then she
explains a philosophy that almost permits such hyperbole: "I had it
very clear in my mind what I want to do. And that was important
because it gave me more security. With a goal in mind you go and go
and go. There's nothing to worry as long as you keep on."</TE>
<TE>   At Buenos Aires' Colon Opera Institute, Tola was performing in an
art song class when "Flicka" von Stade, appearing at the opera house
in Debussy's "Pelleas et Melisande," stopped by to listen.</TE>
<TE>   Tola sang an excerpt from Ravel's song cycle "Sheherazade." When
she saw Von Stade among the observers, Tola's trademark worries
leaped to the surface. She clasps both hands to her head at the
memory. "'Oh, no,' I thought. 'She is the master. This is terrible.'
But afterward she came to meet me and told me very nice things, how
she liked what I did. A few days later, I opened the newspaper and
saw an article about Frederica in which she said a lot about me."</TE>
<TE>   Before the next "Pelleas" performance, the student singer came to
the opera star's dressing room to say thanks "for her great
generosity" and the two struck up an e-mail correspondence that
included lots of mentoring, in the vein of "Dear Flicka, How do I do
this? And that?"</TE>
<TE>   Shortly thereafter, Tola entered Norway's Queen Sonja
International Music Competition where, before a jury that included
mezzo-soprano Christa Ludwig and soprano Birgit Nilsson, she walked
away with first prize. That was two years ago.</TE>
<TE>   Von Stade took great delight in the win and, in a subsequent
e-mail, quoted for Tola an Opera News interview with Ludwig in which
the mezzo handed rave notices to the fledgling soprano.</TE>
<TE>   And that's not the end of the Cinderella story. "At that same time
of the article," Tola says, "Flicka was singing 'Merry Widow' with
Placido at the Met. She showed him the interview and he became
interested in me."</TE>
<TE>   Domingo, famously acquisitive when it comes to young, undiscovered
talent, arranged for Tola to travel to New York and audition for him
and others, including his agent, who promptly added her to his list
of clients. Domingo also offered her the trouser role of Oscar in
Verdi's "Masked Ball" with the Washington Opera, where he has been
artistic director since November 1996.</TE>
<TE>   "The best thing for me as a singer is Placido," Tola says. "But I
had to say no. The tessitura of that role lies too high for my
voice."</TE>
<TE>   The same trip yielded an offer with the Met's young artist
program. She nixed that also, preferring to get onstage experience
and not be an apprentice.</TE>
<TE>   Domingo had only one more suggestion: that she enter Operalia, the
semiannual competition he sponsors in various cities around the
world.</TE>
<TE>   It was against her strongest impulse. Even though she had won in
Norway, she had decided never to participate in another competition
"because artistry is intangible, not something that squeezes people
into a kind of ranking." Still, she took Domingo's advice and
competed in the contest when it was held in Los Angeles in September
2000.</TE>
<TE>   "I told him I had to win," she remembers, just to keep her
standing after the Oslo prize. As it turned out, she took three
prizes and more.</TE>
<TE>   During the semifinals and before the competition results were in,
the tenor asked her what she might be doing in October and if she
wanted to sing some concerts with him in Mexico. "At that moment the
competition no longer mattered," she says. "I knew I had won."</TE>
<TE>   Since then, things have been popping fast. There have been
concerts with Domingo in Germany and Spain. And for her first opera
contract outside of Argentina,Tola went to Oslo to sing Mimi in "La
Boheme," which she'll repeat this spring at Austria's Bregenz
Festival.</TE>
<TE>   Next fall, she'll make her debut with Washington Opera in the same
role, to be followed by Micaela in "Carmen," which she will also sing
later in the season in Madrid.</TE>
<TE>   Whatever Tola's fears as she faced her debut in "Merry Widow," the
critics tended to be kind if not voluble. Times music critic Mark
Swed called her Valencienne "dazzling"; others praised her sound but
found fault with her consistency and diction.</TE>
<TE>   How she conquered her debut worries is a secret Tola agrees to
share: finding the key to the character and never dropping it.</TE>
<TE>   "Valencienne, for me, is Audrey Hepburn. I've seen her films,
'Sabrina' and 'My Fair Lady.' In fact, I have the same language
problems as [Eliza Doolittle], trying to speak correct English. If I
think Audrey Hepburn on stage, people will love me. Her way is how
Valencienne can be"--and in fact, she created a shyly delicate
persona that may owe more to Hepburn than the standard saucy
soubrette most often seen.</TE>
<TE>   For Tola, the key is in communicating. She speaks with much less
trepidation when she considers recital or chamber-music settings,
where, she says, "I can touch a hundred people, and in the intimate
space make something deeply personal of the words and the music."</TE>
<TE>   And that takes her back to the talismanic lessons she says she has
learned best from Domingo:</TE>
<TE>   "Giving is what's important," says Tola. "Giving my soul, my
feelings. The voice and the acting are not important if you give your
soul. Because as a human being you can have a very good performance
one night and not the next. We're not machines. But if you can open
yourself to give your soul, it's the best thing there is."</TE>

<LD>   With the help of his girlfriend and burnout brother, a high school
senior has 24 hours to salvage his botched application to Stanford in
the comedy "Orange County." Written by Mike White ("Chuck &amp; Buck,"
the TV series "Pasadena"), the film features a trio of Hollywood
progenies: director Jake Kasdan (son of writer-director Lawrence
Kasdan), and co-stars Colin Hanks (son of Tom Hanks) and Schuyler
Fisk (daughter of Sissy Spacek). Jack Black, Catherine O'Hara and
John Lithgow provide comedic support. Opens Friday. Above, Hanks,
left, Fisk and Kasdan.</LD>
<LD>   Also: A mysterious creature terrorizes the French countryside in
the period adventure "Brotherhood of the Wolf," a mix of martial arts
action and European art film. King Louis XV sends the unorthodox
pairing of a scientist and his Iroquois blood brother to the rural
province where the beast has been savagely killing women and children
for years. Samuel Le Bihan and Vincent Cassel star. Opens Friday.</LD>
<TE>   Theater</TE>
<TE>   After a 10-year absence, noted playwright John Steppling returns
to the Los Angeles theater scene with the American premiere of "Dog
Mouth," presented by Padua Playwrights Productions. Steppling will
direct the drama, an exploration of North America's dispossessed
featuring Methedrine-driven criminal hobos, a quest for the ultimate
fighting dog and a young woman's deal with the devil. Opens Saturday
at the Evidence Room in Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Music</TE>
<TE>   Esa-Pekka Salonen returns to his podium with the Los Angeles
Philharmonic on Friday afternoon in L.A.'s Dorothy Chandler Pavilion
with two large-scale works: Arnold Schoenberg's symphonic poem
"Pelleas and Melisande" and Brahms' D-minor Piano Concerto, featuring
soloist Helene Grimaud, left. The program repeats on Saturday and
next Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   Art</TE>
<TE>   Artist Graham Nickson may live in New York, but his primary
subject, sunbathers at the beach, is quintessentially Californian.
"Graham Nickson: Dual Natures," opening Saturday at Pepperdine
University's Frederick R. Weisman Museum in Malibu, will present 11
monumental paintings and 10 charcoal drawings that track the artist's
fascination with beach folks during the past 20 years.</TE>
<TE>   Jazz</TE>
<TE>   One of the most influential of the post-John Coltrane
saxophonists, Charles Lloyd begins a three-nighter Friday at Catalina
Bar &amp; Grill in Hollywood. Lloyd's career has been marked by ups and
downs, but he has recently emerged as one of jazz's most creatively
original voices.</TE>
<TE>   Pop Music</TE>
<TE>   Two survivors of the punk and post-punk wars are living proof that
advancing years don't necessarily lead to arthritic music. Mid-'70s
British firebrand Graham Parker, below, is now a Woodstock resident
and recently released a potent album, "Deepcut to Nowhere."
Meanwhile, former Pixies ringmaster Frank Black has evolved into an
engaging eccentric. They team for shows at San Juan Capistrano's
Coach House on Thursday and West Hollywood's Troubadour on Friday.</TE>

<LD>   STARSAILOR, "Love Is Here", Capitol</LD>
<LD>   The late Tim Buckley's poetically ambitious music and lyrics often
bespoke an audacity well beyond his years, a mantle picked up by his
son Jeff Buckley before his own death in 1997. James Walsh, the young
singer-songwriter at the helm of this English band, readily invites
comparisons--not only does he evoke both Buckleys in songs on this
debut album (due in stores Tuesday), but he also named his band after
one of the elder artist's most audacious albums.</LD>
<TE>   Walsh's audacity, though, is more of his youth than beyond it. His
reach exceeds his grasp as he stretches both his voice and words in
his quest to convey Big Emotions. He regularly casts himself as a
haven of love and grace in a stormy world. "Stay by my side and the
pipe dream is yours now," he sings to a troubled object of his
affection in the song "Alcoholic."</TE>
<TE>   But his melodies rarely fail to soar, and the band provides
dynamic support from rather basic guitar and piano elements, if never
achieving the Buckleys' inventively elliptical jazzy-rock heights. At
least Walsh has reach and ambition, placing Starsailor alongside such
British new romantics as Coldplay, Doves and Travis.</TE>
<TE>   Much of "Love Is Here" is moving and compelling enough that the
youthful sins ought not be merely tolerated, but encouraged.

<TE>   In Brief</TE>
<TE>   **1/2 Ruff Ryders, "Ryde or Die Vol. III: In the 'R' We Trust,"
Ruff Ryders/Interscope. Enlisting outside help proves to be a wise
move for the Ruff Ryders. Non-members Petey Pablo and Ludacris
deliver the strongest performances on the New York hip-hop
collective's boast-heavy, street-centered third compilation. Ruff
Ryders members Eve, Jadakiss and DMX make contributions that are
solid but that won't be mistaken for their better work. The heavy,
synthesized sound of the collection leans toward redundancy despite
its force.</TE>
<TE>   --Soren Baker</TE>
<TE>   **1/2 Various artists, "I Am Sam" soundtrack, V2. For this movie
about a Beatles-loving, mentally challenged man, 17 acts mostly stick
close to the blueprints on selections from the Lennon-McCartney
songbook. Aimee Mann and Michael Penn ("Two of Us"), Rufus Wainwright
("Across the Universe"), Eddie Vedder ("You've Got to Hide Your Love
Away"), Sheryl Crow ("Mother Nature's Son") and Nick Cave ("Let It
Be") lend distinction via their voices alone. Straying from the
originals, though, Chocolate Genius (elaborating "Julia"), Paul
Westerberg (internalizing "Nowhere Man") and Grandaddy (an alt-rock
"Revolution") transcend mere reverence.</TE>
<TE>   --S.H.</TE>
<TE>   ** The Leaving Trains, "Emotional Legs," Steel Cage. Falling
James--L.A. rock's most enduringly obscure singing, songwriting
transvestite-politician--and company offer a grab bag of originals
and offbeat outside material. Things start strong with the pop-punker
"Big Baby," but it's a bumpy ride from dirge-like Lou Reed-isms to
snarky revenge fantasies to misfit love songs. Still, the players
skillfully navigate the changes, and James' way of fusing anger and
vulnerability has genuine twisted charm. Catch 'em at Spaceland in
L.A. on Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   --Natalie Nichols</TE>
<TE>   *1/2 Zap Mama, "Push It to the Max," Luaka Bop. It's a stretch to
call this a Zap Mama album. In fact, it's an EP set of remixes of
tunes--"Nostalgie Amoureuse," "Bottom," "Mr. Brown" and "Poetry
Man"--from three Zap Mama CDs with a teaser, "Ca Varie Varie," from
an upcoming release. Are the tunes improved by the remixes? Only if
you feel Marie Daulne's evocative works are enhanced by repetitious
dance rhythms and irrelevant additional vocals. So, caveat emptor,
and save your bucks for the next real Zap Mama album, due sometime
this year.</TE>
<TE>   --Don Heckman</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Albums are rated on a scale of one star (poor), two stars (fair),
three stars (good) and four stars (excellent). The albums are already
released unless otherwise noted.</TE>

<HD>Instant Culture for Sale</HD>
<DH>Bankruptcy has meant an uncertain fate for the huge
Polaroid collection of images capturing a nation and an art form in
flux.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRISTOPHER REYNOLDS</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When curators of photography dream, what do they see? Maybe this:
drawer after drawer of carefully preserved snapshots and outsized
prints--Ansel Adams landscapes, David Hockney photo collages, Andy
Warhol celebrity portraits, William Wegman Weimaraners--all in the
hands of a company eager to sell off its assets.</LD>
<LD>   Those images and more, by photographers from Walker Evans to
Robert Mapplethorpe, are all part of the collection that waits in the
various vaults of the Cambridge, Mass.-based Polaroid Corp.,
cash-strapped creator of the instant photograph. The company is still
in operation, but it sought bankruptcy protection in October and has
been selling itself off in parts ever since.</LD>
<LD>   So far, its photo collection has been untouched in the corporate
foraging through Polaroid's $1.8 billion in assets, and even insiders
say it's almost impossible to predict when the pictures might be
sold, or to whom, or for how much. Although many curators and
collectors agree that the collection is worth millions, there's no
estimated value on record, nor even a precise count of how many
images Polaroid has--the interns who were doing an inventory have
been let go to cut costs.</LD>
<TE>   But ask a photo specialist about the Polaroid files, and the
answers are quick and eager: The collection, amassed over six
decades, is a window on American culture, an invaluable tool for
anyone tracking the evolution of photography, and a medley of
photography's biggest names.</TE>
<TE>   "There's a lot of buzz about it," said Arthur Ollman, director of
the Museum of Photographic Arts in San Diego. Ollman said he heard
the Polaroid collection mentioned often at a November conference he
hosted of photography curators from museums worldwide.</TE>
<TE>   For any of those institutions, the Polaroid pictures "would be
more than just an addition. It would be an avalanche of new and
wonderful material. If you really want to look at the second half of
the 20th century, a huge number of the greatest producers are
represented." Ollman said.</TE>
<TE>   "We think we have somewhere in the vicinity of 24,000 photos,"
said Barbara Hitchcock, director of cultural affairs for Polaroid in
Waltham, Mass. "We don't have a complete handle on it, because we
don't have everything in one database." In some cases, Hitchcock
said, "we're physically walking through offices and looking" to
verify which images are in storage and which are on loan to
executives.</TE>
<TE>   For anyone who has watched an insurance man fish an instant camera
out of his claims-adjusting toolkit, or stood among the millions of
drivers who are snapped annually in DMV offices via Polaroid's
identity systems division, it may be a stretch to think of a Polaroid
picture as fine art. But in museum corridors across the land, it's no
stretch at all.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think there's another corporation collection [of
photography] that even comes close," said Trudy Wilner Stack, curator
of exhibits and collections at the Center for Creative Photography in
Tucson.</TE>
<TE>   Polaroid's greatest selling point has always been instant
gratification. Dr. Edwin Land, the Harvard dropout inventor who
founded the company, said the idea for an instant-image camera came
to him on a 1944 family trip to New Mexico, when his daughter asked
why she couldn't see an immediate result after he snapped a photo.</TE>
<TE>   Four years later, Land brought the first instant camera to market,
relying on a process in which dye colors passed from a negative to a
positive print, all inside the camera body, within about a minute.
With the spontaneity and interaction that allowed, the relationship
between photographers and their subjects was forever changed.</TE>
<TE>   Through the decades, the company's researchers refined the
process, devising cameras to deliver color images (which arrived in
1963), pictures in as little as 10 seconds, pictures from negatives
as large as 20 by 24 inches. Until 60-minute photo processing and
then the digital camera came along, the utility of Polaroid
on-the-spot processing was unrivaled.</TE>
<TE>   While Polaroid was earning a reputation in the marketplace as a
producer of simple cameras for the masses, the company's leaders took
pains to forge a connection with fine artists. For decades, Polaroid
has sought out promising artists, then traded access to equipment for
feedback and prints.</TE>
<TE>   The first such bargain was struck between Land and Ansel Adams,
who in 1948 began serving as a Polaroid consultant, testing new films
and equipment.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, some of the Polaroid collection's greatest attractions
are filed under A: more than 500 Adams prints, along with more than
5,000 pages of letters and memos from Adams to the company's
scientists and executives.</TE>
<TE>   From Nov. 13, 1951: "Have you considered the tremendous effect
your new high speed film may have on astronomical photography?
Especially in rendering surface details of the planets.... And a
whole new world opens up with the possibility of photographing, under
low-light conditions, individuals, groups, meetings, theater, opera,
etc."</TE>
<TE>   From March 28, 1954: "THE WORLD NEEDS A GOOD $50 SHUTTER!"</TE>
<TE>   From Dec. 4, 1972: "It was really exciting to work with the SX-70
and I am tremendously impressed....The camera itself is a rather
miraculous instrument."</TE>
<TE>   Land made such an impression on Adams that the photographer
devoted a chapter of his autobiography to the inventor and
entrepreneur. Land, wrote Adams, "felt that with the Polaroid
process, 'Everyone can be an artist.' I had a friendly disagreement
with him about the definition of artist, but I knew what he intended
by that statement."</TE>
<TE>   Adams (who died in 1984, after more than 35 years of
correspondence with the company) was soon followed by a parade of
photography luminaries and luminaries-to-be. Imogen Cunningham, Paul
Caponigro, Robert Frank, Olivia Parker, Lucas Samaras, Joyce
Tenneson, Jerry Uelsmann and Minor White all contributed to the
collection, and in the 1960s the company recruited star European
photographers including David Bailey, Sarah Moon, Helmut Newton and
Josef Sudek.</TE>
<TE>   Polaroid's U.S. and international collections, merged in 1990,
bring together works from more than 1,000 photographers. Typically,
the artists contributed prints to the company but retained their
copyrights.</TE>
<TE>   The company's peak year may have been 1978. That's when its work
force (now less than 7,000 and dwindling daily) topped out at more
than 20,000. The same year, Polaroid unveiled a program to give
artists access to a new 20-by-24 camera, a 235-pound mechanical
marvel that yields up to 20-by-24-inch contact prints--works of
"saturated color and frightening sharpness," in the words of
Polaroid's longtime studio director, John Reuter.</TE>
<TE>   Just six Polaroid 20-by-24 cameras exist, in studios in Boston,
Cambridge, New York, San Francisco and Prague. Beginning in 1979,
Wegman used one to make portraits of his Weimaraners, Man Ray and Fay
Ray, in absurd poses. Artists Mapplethorpe, Chuck Close, Dawoud Bey,
Timothy Greenfield-Sanders, Annie Leibovitz, and Robert Rauschenberg
were among those who followed. Adams used the big camera to make a
portrait of then-President Jimmy Carter (who almost ruined the
session by spending so much time marveling at the camera's workings),
and Andy Warhol did a series of self-portraits.</TE>
<TE>   But like Adams, Warhol was also taken with the possibilities of
the high-quality but still fast and portable Polaroid SX-70 camera.
So were Walker Evans, near the end of his celebrated career in
photography, and David Hockney, near the beginning of his.</TE>
<TE>   In the early 1970s, Evans, known for decades for his work in
black-and-white, took to grabbing color images with an SX-70, telling
friends, "You photograph things you wouldn't think of photographing
before." (One such image, of a dead-end sign made less than a year
before Evans' death, is now part of the photography collection of the
J. Paul Getty Museum in Brentwood.)</TE>
<TE>   By 1981, Hockney was already famous for his drawings and
paintings. But that year, the artist has said, he "started to play
with the Polaroid camera and began making collages. This intrigued me
and I became obsessed with it."</TE>
<TE>   Eventually, his collage work grew into a photo-cubism foray that
was covered extensively in a 2001 exhibition at the Museum of
Contemporary Art in Los Angeles. (In later collages, Hockney switched
from Polaroid images, which have white borders, to traditional print
film, which doesn't.)</TE>
<TE>   Warhol's use of Polaroid's product, however, may have been more
freewheeling than any other of the company's big-name collaborators.</TE>
<TE>   Warhol not only made Polaroid snapshots as studies for larger
silk-screen portraits in the 1970s, the artist said he often
stationed himself at the entrance to his Manhattan studio and asked
male visitors to drop their pants.</TE>
<TE>   "No matter how straight-looking he was, I'd ask him to take his
pants off so I could photograph his [genitals]," Warhol wrote in a
memoir. "It was surprising who'd let me and who wouldn't."</TE>
<TE>   The Warhol images in Polaroid's collection, Hitchcock said, are
more conventional self-portraits and G-rated snaps of celebrities
such as Ted Kennedy, Farrah Fawcett, Sylvester Stallone and Bianca
Jagger.</TE>
<TE>   Right now, most of the works are stored in Polaroid's Waltham
offices, Hitchcock said. But the company displays some works at
Polaroid facilities around the U.S. and houses others at La Maison
Europeenne de la Photographie in Paris and Le Musee de l'Elysee in
Lausanne, Switzerland. Through the years, a few thousand images have
been displayed through Polaroid's exhibition program, which still has
shows on the road.</TE>
<TE>   "Innovation/Imagination: 50 Years of Polaroid Photography"
(assembled to celebrate the company's 50th anniversary in 1998) opens
Jan. 15 at the University of New Mexico Art Gallery in Albuquerque.
"American Perspectives: Photographs From the Polaroid Collection"
spent most of 2001 in Japan before returning to the U.S. in
September. Another exhibition, an 84-image Ansel Adams show, finished
a two-month run in Quito, Ecuador, in November.</TE>
<TE>   "Polaroid color is intense, slightly unreal, adding its own sheen
to an image," art critic Jonathan Jones of London's Guardian has
written.</TE>
<TE>   "This appealed to artists because it made explicit the artifice of
the photograph. The popularization of Polaroid in the 1970s coincided
with conceptual art and its rebellion against fine media. Conceptual
artists liked photographs that were as unartistic, unpretentious and
close to the ordinary snapshot (or even photo-booth portrait) as
possible. They adored Polaroid."</TE>
<TE>   The next step in this story depends largely on Polaroid's tortured
finances.</TE>
<TE>   Although analysts say Polaroid has been troubled for years, it
remained a formidable marketplace name long after Land stepped down
as chief executive in 1980 and died in 1991. In fact, the company's
annual report for 2000 showed sales of $1.85 billion, including 13.1
million instant cameras. That, spokesman Skip Colcord said, is more
instant cameras that in any year of its history.</TE>
<TE>   But the company's debts have mounted during the last two decades,
and as digital photo technology appeared on the scene in the 1990s,
analysts said, Polaroid was slow to respond.</TE>
<TE>   When the company's officers filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy
reorganization protection Oct. 12, they cited $950 million in debts
and a steep decline in 2001 revenues, and said they believed their
best option was the sale of "all or parts of the company." Since
then, they've been laying off workers, peddling real estate holdings,
curtailing health and life insurance benefits to pensioners, and
shedding possessions that Polaroid Chairman and Chief Executive Gary
T. DiCamillo says "are not part of our core instant imaging
business."</TE>
<TE>   On Dec. 3, DiCamillo announced a deal to sell the company's
profitable driver's license photo division to Oregon-based Digimarc
for $56.5 million. On Dec. 19, he disclosed plans for a $4.8-million
sale of the Polaroid subsidiary that specializes in digital imaging
technology for real estate and insurance inspectors. Both
transactions are subject to approval from courts and other regulatory
agencies.</TE>
<TE>   Spokesman Colcord said the Polaroid art collection "is not among
our priorities" for rapid sale, but it is on the table. The images
stand out as a handsome asset that could be separated from the rest
of the company with relative ease, and it's not uncommon for troubled
enterprises to clear debts, or signal a change in strategy, by
selling off art.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, with the centennial of Adams' birth approaching Feb. 20
and a retrospective of his work touring North America and Europe (its
opening run at the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art ends next
Sunday; it is scheduled to reach the Los Angeles County Museum of Art
on Feb. 2, 2003), Polaroid isn't the only organization pondering an
emergency sale of his work.</TE>
<TE>   After a financial crisis forced the October closure of the Friends
of Photography, a San Francisco group founded by Adams and friends in
1967, the group's officials said they hoped to retire the
organization's $1.2 million in debts by selling off 138 prints made
by Adams in the 1970s. (The collection's assessed value is $1.5
million to $2 million, officials said, and a sale to a single buyer
is expected early this year.)</TE>
<TE>   Far higher prices have been paid for some corporate art
collections. About a week after MGM Grand Inc. bought Mirage Resorts
from Las Vegas mogul Stephen Wynn in May 2000, the new owner sold off
11 artworks from Mirage's Bellagio Gallery of Fine Art, raising $124
million. In November 1998, Reader's Digest raised $94.5 million by
auctioning off 37 Impressionist, Modernist and contemporary works
from its 8,000-piece art collection, which is considered to rank
among the world's leading corporate collections.</TE>
<TE>   Currently, the collapse of Enron, the energy and trading company
headquartered in Houston, puts into play a fledgling corporate
collection that is worth about $2 million.</TE>
<TE>   As for the Polaroid collection's worth, there are only hints.
Before it began its recently concluded tour of Japanese museums, the
company's 162-image "American Perspectives" show was appraised by
insurers at about $778,000, Hitchcock said. She added that Polaroid
"would like to keep the collections together because of their
historical value."</TE>
<TE>   But if the principal objective is bringing in money, outsiders
say, it might be tempting to break up the collection into
representative chunks. That way individual collectors might be more
inclined to join museums in vying for the pictures. But nothing seems
certain.</TE>
<TE>   "When I think about the fixed assets and how [Polaroid's] founder
accumulated all of these long-term assets [from art to real estate],
I can't imagine that they would just sell all the art. I imagine that
they would try to hold on to the most valuable pieces," said Chedly
Milord, a New York-based analyst at the Fitch bond-rating agency.
That way, Milord said, the core of the company and the core of its
visual archive would end up under the same new ownership, whomever
that might be.</TE>
<TE>   No matter who ends up with the pictures, preserving them will be a
big job. Because of their chemistry, Polaroid images often require
more care than the black-and-white prints that dominate many photo
collections. To last without their colors fading or emulsions
cracking, they may require dry and dark storage at or below 60
degrees.</TE>
<TE>   "There are a lot of unknowns over how the prints are going to
endure over the long term," said Wilner Stack of the Center for
Creative Photography. She is closely watching two of her
institution's Polaroid acquisitions from the mid-1990s as a sort of
test case in preservation--a successful one, so far.</TE>
<TE>   Those unknowns, and the breadth of the collection, suggest the
most likely bidder would be an institution. "It's perfectly suited
for a museum, because it's a broad-based collection representative of
a certain space in time," said David Fahey, co-owner of Fahey/Klein
Gallery in Los Angeles and a photography dealer for 26 years. In
fact, Fahey said, "it's so vast that I wouldn't know of a private
person who would be a client for this. Anybody who's interested in
[nearly] 25,000 images has to be an institution."</TE>
<TE>   Experts agree that most photography-collecting museums couldn't
afford all of Polaroid's pictures. As a result, many eyes are on a
handful of particularly well-endowed institutions, including the
Getty and the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston.</TE>
<TE>   Since 1984, the Getty has built one of the leading photography
collections in the U.S.: more than 65,000 prints made from the 1830s
to the 1940s, along with a relatively small number of more
contemporary images. The Getty's photography curator, Weston Naef,
declined to comment for this article.</TE>
<TE>   At the Museum of Fine Arts, which collects 20th century
photography and has collaborated with neighboring Polaroid over the
decades, a spokeswoman acknowledged that the collection's fate is
"the question of the hour," but curators there also declined to
comment on whether the museum would bid on it.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, as the Guardian's Jones noted soon after Polaroid's
bankruptcy announcement, it's not just the company's art collection
that people will see differently now. There's also the extended
Polaroid archive--that is, those countless, half-forgotten,
image-filled boxes and albums that lurk in closets across America and
beyond.</TE>
<TE>   No matter what comes next for the company and its collection,
Jones wrote, "all those Polaroid pictures taken and treasured, the
party photos and baby shots, will now immediately start to look aged,
more distant, as if they belonged to another era." .</TE>

<SM>Polaroid's art collection, a star-studded trove of 24,000
images by such artists as Ansel Adams, Chuck Close, David Hockney,
Andy Warhol and William Wegman, may be up for grabs. Polaroid,
bankrupt since October, is selling off holdings, and curators agree
that the collection is a unique window onto the 20th century. But is
this symbol of instant culture too instant for its own good?</SM>

<HD>Renee Rosnes Stirs Up the Musical Melting Pot</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DON HECKMAN</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Canadian-born pianist Renee Rosnes has one of the most enviable
resumes in jazz. Among the many musical associations it lists are
pairings with the likes of Joe Henderson, Wayne Shorter, Branford
Marsalis, James Moody and J.J. Johnson. In addition, Rosnes has
released a series of well-crafted, musically imaginative recordings
that feature her crisp, bop-based improvisation and
envelope-stretching compositions.</LD>
<LD>   So why is it that she continues to have--insofar as the wider jazz
audience is concerned--such relatively low visibility? While I
hesitate to identify sexism as a primary cause, I wouldn't eliminate
it either, given the genre's traditionally male domination. In this
sometimes misogynistic environment, female jazz instrumentalists have
frequently faced a rocky climb to prominence. (Don't be dissuaded by
Diana Krall's remarkable successes; despite her fine piano playing,
it is her voice that is generating sales of tons of CDs.)</LD>
<TE>   Rosnes is far from the only female jazz artist obliged to deal
with the perilous, even Sisyphean, aspects faced by women in their
ascent to the music's upper levels. In recent years alone, a great
deal of compelling music--from fine players such as Lynn Arriale,
Geri Allen, Jane Ira Bloom, Sara Cion, Eliane Elias, Myra Melford and
Jane Bunnett, to name only a few--has received considerably less
notice than deserved. It's especially unfortunate in the case of
Rosnes, given the growingly impressive quality of her work, and the
expanding horizons of her musical vision.</TE>
<TE>   "Life on Earth" (***1/2, Blue Note), scheduled for release
Tuesday, is an important album, not just for Rosnes, but for jazz as
a whole. With this recording, she makes a persuasive case for the
music's capacity to interface in meaningful creative fashion with
elements of other musical cultures. Such synthesis is not new, of
course, dating from Jelly Roll Morton's fascination with the "Spanish
tinge" to the recent appearances by Pharoah Sanders, Herbie Hancock
and Wayne Shorter on an album by Ethiopian singer Gigi. But Rosnes
brings together a surprisingly diverse collection of global elements
into a rich, seamless tapestry of musical colors.</TE>
<TE>   Among the international players present: Indian tabla drummer
Zakir Hussain, Senegalese djembe (West African drum) player Mor Thiam
and Brazilian percussionist Duduka Da Fonseca. Add to that a Western
contingent of drummers Jeff "Tain" Watts and Billy Drummond (Rosnes'
husband); bassists John Patitucci and Christian McBride; saxophonists
Chris Potter and Walt Weiskopf and trombonist (and conch shell
player) Steve Turre. That's a load of talent, and Rosnes makes the
most of it in atmospheric originals seasoned by lovely piano trio
renderings of the Fran Landesman-Tommy Wolf cabaret classic "Ballad
of the Sad Young Men," and "Nana," from a suite of Andalusian folk
songs arranged by Manuel De Falla.</TE>
<TE>   In the originals, Rosnes' solutions to the problems of stylistic
integration are startlingly effective: the way, for example, she
links the harmonies of her improvising on "Empress Afternoon" to the
single-pitch rhythms of Hussain's tabla drumming; the high-life feel
of "Senegal Son," with Steve Nelson added on marimba, Shelley Brown
on alto flute and Thiam on percussion and vocal sounds; the use of
sampled Balinese monk chants in "Hanuman"; and the addition of
chanting from Native American singer Kevin Tarrant on "Icelight," a
piece inspired by Rosnes' memories of the Canadian Northwest.</TE>
<TE>   This may all sound like a musical grab bag, but it's much more
than that, a musical mosaic shimmering with dazzling combinations of
sound and rhythm on virtually every track. If there's any justice in
the world, "Life on Earth" is the album that will introduce many more
listeners to Rosnes' exceptional talents.</TE>
<TE>   IN THE BOOK BAG: It's not easy to write about jazz or, for that
matter, any other kind of music. But that doesn't stop the determined
authors who annually produce dozens of jazz books--from biographies
and critical essays to review collections and novels. The last month
or so has seen the publication of three interesting, if occasionally
uneven, works:</TE>
<TE>   "88: The Giants of Jazz Piano" by Robert L. Doerschuk (Backbeat
Books). The numerical title of the collection of capsule biographies
refers to the number of keys on a standard piano. A convenient
device, perhaps, but an artifice that has nothing to do with the
number of artists who should or shouldn't have been included. That
said, Doerschuk has assembled a useful brief reference work embracing
the careers of--to mention some of the more prominent stylists
included--Jelly Roll Morton, Art Tatum, Bud Powell, Bill Evans, Chick
Corea, Randy Weston and McCoy Tyner. But among the numerous important
pianists omitted: Andrew Hill, Junior Mance, Mel Powell, Herbie
Nichols and Horace Tapscott.</TE>
<TE>   "Gil Evans: Out of the Cool" by Stephanie Stein Crease (A
Cappella). It's surprising that it's taken this long for an in-depth
biography of Evans, a pianist-orchestrator whose collaborations with
Miles Davis produced some of the most essential recordings in jazz
history. Crease is generally long on detail and short on insight,
however. For example, she provides chapter and verse on the details
surrounding the studio sessions for the collaboration with Davis on
"Porgy and Bess," "Sketches of Spain" and other large-ensemble
recordings, without dipping into Evans' feelings regarding his
complex relationship--emotional and financial--with Davis. Although
we learn a great deal about the passage points in Evans' life, we
discover far too little about the inner currents that drove this
gifted but enigmatic artist.</TE>
<TE>   "Trumpet Kings" by Scott Yanow (Backbeat Books). Does Yanow ever
sleep? This latest effort is his fifth jazz reference work in less
than two years. Unlike Doerschuk, Yanow is not limited to a preset
number of entries, and includes capsule biographies of no fewer than
479 trumpeters. If you've got a favorite, he's probably included
here. Yanow does a workmanlike job of positioning his large cast of
characters biographically and musically. As an added bonus, many of
the entries include recommended recordings, videos, film appearances
and reference works.</TE>
<TE>   2002 promises a busy schedule of new jazz tomes. Among the titles
listed for publication in the next few months:</TE>
<TE>   January--"Open the Door: The Life and Music of Betty Carter" by
William R. Bauer (University of Michigan Press); "Something to Live
For: The Music of Billy Strayhorn" by Walter Van De Leur (Oxford
University Press).</TE>
<TE>   February--"Lester Leaps In: The Life and Times of Lester 'Pres'
Young" by Douglas Henry Daniels (Beacon Press); "With Only My Violin:
The Memoirs of Stephane Grappelli" by Grappelli and Jean-Marc Bramy
(Welcome Rain).</TE>
<TE>   March--"Good Morning Blues: The Autobiography of Count Basie" by
Albert Murray (Da Capo Press).</TE>
<TE>   May--"Looking for Chet Baker," an Evan Horne Mystery by Bill Moody
(Walker &amp; Co.).</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>

<HD>How to Succeed by Really Trying</HD>
<DH>When it comes to making it across the pond, British rockers
have adopted the American work ethic. A U.S. label doesn't hurt,
either.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PHIL SUTCLIFFE</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>LONDON</DL>
<LD>Although, since the Beatles, we British music fans have often
affected insouciant confidence in the superiority of our taste over
the rest of the world's--and particularly America's--regardless of
crude measures such as sales and chart positions, we experienced a
Damascene moment in the late '90s.</LD>
<LD>   It was when the Billboard 200 album chart revealed that the only
British entrant younger than 50 was classical-pop ingenue Charlotte
Church. "Oh, crikey!" we said.</LD>
<LD>   Well, of course, Radiohead boosted morale as "The Bends" and "OK
Computer" showed that the poor Britsucker could still get an even
break. And the younger crowd of managers, rivals on the home front,
started to talk among themselves about the problems and possibilities
of tackling that almost mythic task, "breaking America."</LD>
<TE>   One such alliance, between Ian McAndrew, co-manager of Craig David
and Travis, and Phil Harvey, manager of Coldplay, sprang up early
last summer at a cricket match, lovers of stereotypes will be pleased
to hear. While Pakistan pulverized England on the greensward, the
managers talked greenbacks. They've been in touch regularly ever
since, McAndrew says.</TE>
<TE>   Dido's manager, Peter Leak, plugged into the conversation too.
Then, just before Christmas, it was Starsailor's people on the
blower, seeking handy hints about how to launch the U.K.'s latest
"sensitive rock" candidate in America (the album comes out
Tuesday--see review, Page 66--and the band opens for the Charlatans
UK on Friday at the Palace in Hollywood).</TE>
<TE>   "Although it's fun working in the States, you do get lonely, so
it's good to be able to share what we learn," McAndrew says.</TE>
<TE>   Their consensus is that a succession of British artists failed
through unwillingness to invest time and money in touring the U.S.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, for their part, the American arms of multinational
majors had little incentive to promote acts signed in other countries
because, if they did make a profit, most of it had to be
"repatriated" within the corporation--and kudos would leak away along
with the cash.</TE>
<TE>   But now the sharper U.K. managers and artists--realistic of
attitude, all old colonial arrogance cauterized--have increased their
chances by reviving the venerable tradition of hard work. And trying
a new business strategy too.</TE>
<TE>   The perspiration aspect is simply getting back on the road. David
Gray showed the way when his "White Ladder" album, now a
million-seller, broke through in 2000 after 11 American tours.</TE>
<TE>   McAndrew's Travis, now promoting its third album, "The Invisible
Band," completed its fifth and sixth U.S. jaunts last year. The band
may return again in May before starting work on its next record.</TE>
<TE>   Multimillion-sellers worldwide in recent years, the Scots
pronounce themselves satisfied that although "The Invisible Band" has
sold only 300,000 in America, their live following is such that they
have packed theaters in Utah or Minnesota, as well as the Universal
Amphitheatre in L.A. in October. "I think it's close to happening for
them now," McAndrew says.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, Coldplay, a fellow purveyor of melodious melancholy,
took the same workmanlike approach, but moved faster--more than
500,000 sales for its debut, "Parachutes," thanks to airplay hit
"Yellow."</TE>
<TE>   If that radio breakthrough was luck of the draw, McAndrew and
company took Craig David's "Born to Do It" on the Dido route toward a
debut platinum. They introduced the 20-year-old star of British R&amp;B
via personal appearances on radio and then TV, where he played
acoustic spots with his guitarist, Fraser T. Smith.</TE>
<TE>   Having earned some acceptance as a musicianly singer-songwriter,
he follows up with a 19-date full-band U.S. tour later this month
(his West Hollywood House of Blues shows Feb. 18-19 sold out in an
hour). A fanatical writer on his laptop in planes and hotel rooms, he
aims to have another album out in the autumn.</TE>
<TE>   But given that the most resolute toil can still be scuppered by a
record company's fiscal politics, more British managements are
steering their charges to sign directly with an American company to
ensure that its attention is not distracted by resentful thoughts of
profits dispatched abroad.</TE>
<TE>   Setting the pattern, Dido and David had indie-label contracts in
the U.K., then, went with Arista and Atlantic, respectively, in the
U.S. Touted British newcomers the Music is following that pattern.
Discovered by the Verve's label Hut in the U.K., it has just signed
to Capitol for America.</TE>
<TE>   The year-ago hopes that U.K. music in America might emerge from
the years of milling confusion that followed Oasis-led Britpop were
at least partly fulfilled.</TE>
<TE>   New U.K. music is still developing pretty well.</TE>
<TE>   Singer-songwriter qualities remain in the ascendant, whether
flaunted by rock bands (nu-prog tendencies manifested by Muse, Elbow)
or quieter, more hip-hop-inflected folkie types (Turin Brakes, Ed
Harcourt).</TE>
<TE>   If we've got any sense, we'll never crow about a "British
invasion" again. However, for the U.K. to continue the present
substantial progress in 2002, some artists America has barely heard
of yet are going to have to break through: This happens to be a year
when the established names of the Radiohead generation and after are
sequestered in studios.</TE>
<TE>   Dido is again recording with her brother, Rollo Armstrong from
Faithless (release maybe late this year or early 2003), and Gray is
on a similar schedule.</TE>
<TE>   Oasis is making its fifth studio album, almost pleading for
another chance, at home and in America, after it lost its way so
badly with "Standing on the Shoulder of Giants."</TE>
<TE>   Gorillaz, the band-cum-animation created by Blur's Damon Albarn
and friends, is recording again after selling a million in America,
but the promised cartoon film to accompany the record may slow things
down.</TE>
<TE>   After a domestic year at home with wife and baby, former Verve
frontman Richard Ashcroft is in the studio, although on the usual
loose rein, so breath-holding is not recommended for those who
enjoyed his 2000 solo debut, "Alone With Everybody." For Radiohead, a
hiatus seems likely following its throwback "hectic" release program
of three albums in the last 18 months.</TE>
<TE>   A year ago, my top tips included David, Gray and Coldplay.
However, these five fit Brits for 2002 are presented with rather less
confidence:</TE>
<TE>   * Starsailor: from the Verve's rugged, cold hometown of Wigan,
Lancashire. Slivers of Radiohead and U2. Articulate, very intense,
instrumentally subtle, but dependent on American reaction to the
strangled, keening voice of James Walsh--a charismatic frontman on
stage.</TE>
<TE>   * Super Furry Animals: Their fifth album, "Rings Around the
World," has just been nominated album of the year in the U.K. by Mojo
magazine. Domestically prestigious, but also appropriate for these
fabulously imaginative explorers. Swim on gentle seas of surfer
harmony. Get all shook up by jolts of electronic zap. How can these
glorious, witty Welshmen and America have ignored each other so long?</TE>
<TE>   * Mull Historical Society: actually solo multi-instrumentalist
Colin McIntyre. He grew up on the Scottish island of Mull, developing
cool 'n' naive lo-fi pop ways to charm (and alarm) rather in the
manner of the White Stripes, Moldy Peaches or even Jonathan Richman.
Just the man to bring the spirit of the Hebrides to New York, Detroit
and even L.A.</TE>
<TE>   * The Music: squally guitars, howly voices, a heavydelic yearning
to play something wonderful, and a perfect 18-year-old's mission
statement: "Generally, life is...." Like Starsailor, from a small,
northern, industrial town--Kippax, Yorkshire.</TE>
<TE>   * So Solid Crew: the only Londoners here and on a different planet
from the other four choices. A 30-strong rap and garage "collective"
of pirate-radio renegades, the bad boys of 2001 in the U.K. were
individually in trouble with the law, and their gigs were banned
after a shooting outside a venue in November. But their album, "They
Don't Know," is sparse, moody, inventive. If David can sell R&amp;B back
to America, maybe So Solid Crew can do it with street rap.</TE>
<TE>   Speculation concluded, I'm amazed to find myself uttering the
words "Robbie Williams" so late in the piece. The U.K.'s biggest pop
star is topping the album chart at home with his Frank Sinatra-Dean
Martin homage, "Swing When You're Winning," and he seems content to
enjoy the domestic laurels. That doesn't chime with the
sweat-and-blood ethos of British music's new laborers.</TE>
<TE>   "I think Robbie has thrown in the towel on America and it was
rather early to do that," reckons McAndrew.</TE>
<TE>   "Look at U2's attitude after 20 years playing there. I talked to
Bono recently, and he said he still considers U2 to be in the process
of breaking America."</TE>

ultraviolet light, lasers, electromagnetic pulses and even plain old
heat as ways to kill anthrax. Tainted mail has sparked a flurry of
invention to adapt technologies developed for civilian uses such as
drying auto paint and killing E. coli to serve the emerging
multibillion-dollar market for fighting bioterrorism.</LD>
<TE>   "We've been getting solicitations from all over the place," U.S.
Postal Service spokesman Gerry Kreienkamp said. "Anyone who thinks
they have something to offer, they've been offering it."</TE>
<TE>   The Postal Service already has awarded two contracts worth $40
million for equipment to sanitize mail by irradiating it with
electron beams. Several other companies across the country are
developing similar machines for use in busy corporate mailrooms.</TE>
<TE>   The urgency to develop new technology is great because mail is
particularly vulnerable to attack. In many respects, it is the ideal
vector for a terrorist seeking to inflict widespread damage while
remaining anonymous. Mail is delivered six days a week to 100 million
households and millions of businesses.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, corporations are looking for ways to sterilize the
letters and packages they process in mailrooms before they are
delivered to employees.</TE>
<TE>   These are the perfect ingredients for an instantly huge new
market--and it is beckoning.</TE>
<TE>   Soon after anthrax-tainted letters arrived at NBC Nightly News
offices in New York and in mailrooms on Capitol Hill, employees at
Consolidated Machine Corp. in Boston joked about cleansing mail with
their company's steam sterilizers, normally used for glassware,
hospital garments and stainless steel medical instruments.</TE>
<TE>   Then they gave it a try.</TE>
<TE>   "We threw some mail into our own sterilizer to see what would
happen to it, and nothing happened," said Arthur Trapotsis, head of
research and development at the 55-year-old company. "We were a
little surprised. I thought maybe the seals might open, but that
didn't happen."</TE>
<TE>   After that successful trial run, Consolidated Machine sold its
first mail-cleansing unit to a New York customer that uses it to
sterilize a few thousand letters each day. The company plans to
market additional units in various sizes at prices ranging from
$20,000 to $100,000, Trapotsis said.</TE>
<TE>   The current wave of technological innovation to meet a pressing
social need is in marked contrast to the sort of entrepreneurship
that fueled the dot-com revolution. In that case, new companies
bankrolled by generous venture capitalists sprang up in rapid
succession, but they often struggled to find customers who needed
their services.</TE>
<TE>   "The dot-coms were all based on the Internet, which was a new
technology," said Eric von Hippel, a professor who studies the
economics of innovation at MIT's Sloan School of Management. "But
often they weren't in new markets. This is a new market."</TE>
<TE>   Despite the burst of creative thinking, some health experts
caution against relying too heavily on new technology. For instance,
machines that work well in laboratory tests might may not be as
reliable in constant everyday use.</TE>
<TE>   "Many of these things have not been well researched, they have not
been well documented, and they have not proved to be really practical
in a routine-use environment," said David Bruckner, chief of the
laboratory medicine division at the UCLA School of Medicine. "I would
be very concerned about marketing this type of thing to the general
public in a way that would make them come away feeling that this was
totally safe and effective. It may or may not be."</TE>
<TE>   But companies in a variety of industries are pressing ahead. "The
solution occurred to me almost immediately," said Gene Ray, chief
executive of Titan Corp., a  $1.5-billion firm with two contracts
from the U.S. Postal Service to irradiate mail with electron beams.
"I got e-mails from at least 10 different employees. Once you knew
anthrax was a bacteria, we knew this was a solution."</TE>
<TE>   Titan developed its technology about a decade ago while working to
develop a way to intercept intercontinental ballistic missiles using
linear accelerators as part of the original "Star Wars" missile
defense program.</TE>
<TE>   The system was never built, so the San Diego company tried to find
other uses for the technology. It eventually was adapted to sterilize
medical equipment and to irradiate food to kill harmful bacteria such
as E. coli.</TE>
<TE>   Titan uses a standard linear accelerator to generate an electron
beam with magnets to force the beam to sweep up and down. As letters
and packages pass in front of the beam, it breaks the double helix
inside any hidden anthrax spores. That prevents the bacteria from
replicating, rendering it useless.</TE>
<TE>   Other companies take different approaches.</TE>
<TE>   Dick Garard's Lambda Technologies Inc. in Morrisville, N.C., is
commercializing variable microwave frequency technology to cure
polymer adhesives on semiconductor chips and circuits. About 60 of
its ovens have been installed around the world.</TE>
<TE>   Garard has investigated whether microwave technology could be used
to pasteurize blood-substitute products by tuning the frequency to
wavelengths that heat--and kill--undesirable molecules but preserve
others. When he learned of the emerging anthrax threat, he suspected
he was looking at a significant business opportunity.</TE>
<TE>   Standard microwaves could ignite letters and packages containing
metal, such as staples and paper clips. But Lambda's technology
doesn't rely on a single frequency, so it doesn't create the standing
waves and energy differentials that cause arcing and start fires,
Garard said.</TE>
<TE>   Initial tests conducted by scientists at the University of North
Carolina in Chapel Hill were promising, but Garard would like to see
the results verified by the Army or the national Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention before bringing any products to market. If all
goes well, each unit could add at least $300,000 to Lambda's coffers
and account for half the company's sales, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Lou Panico said he was drawn to this market by a sense of
patriotism. His company, Xenon Corp., uses ultraviolet light to
sterilize hospital equipment and to cure items ranging from DVDs to
fiber optics to the coating on cars.</TE>
<TE>   "Before Sept. 11, we were focusing on sterilizing hospital
keyboards to kill communicable diseases," said Panico, chief
executive of the Woburn, Mass.-based company. "Then we diverted to
mail. I'm an ex-Marine, so I got very patriotic. I wanted to help."</TE>
<TE>   The result is the SteriPulse XL 5000, which can cleanse 5,000
pieces of mail in a 24-hour period. It comes with a $250,000 price
tag, and Panico expects it to be so popular with small post offices
and corporate customers that it could account for 50% of the
company's sales, which were $3.7 million last year.</TE>
<TE>   That might be wishful thinking for a product that can disable
anthrax spores only on the surface of letters and packages, but not
kill those that might lurk inside. The Postal Service has panned UV
technology for that reason.</TE>
<TE>   Precision Environmental Inc. sold one of its $9,500 heat chambers
to Gannett Co., the media company that publishes USA Today. For 17
years, Redwood City, Calif.-based Precision Environmental has been
using heat instead of toxic chemicals to kill viruses, molds and
insects inside buildings.</TE>
<TE>   Soon after the anthrax attacks, a biologist who worked with the
company called CEODave Hedman and suggested he develop a system for
sterilizing mail.</TE>
<TE>   The result is a heat cabinet about the size of a large
refrigerator that can bake mail at 300 degrees Fahrenheit for eight
hours--more than long enough to kill anthrax spores inside envelopes.
The only thing that distinguishes treated mail from untreated mail is
that the plastic windows on some business envelopes curl up, Hedman
said.</TE>
<TE>   Kreienkamp, of the Postal Service, cautioned that a long-term
solution might be far off. Sterilizing every piece of mail probably
isn't feasible, so postal executives are focusing on "anonymous
mail," the letters and packages that enter the system through corner
collection boxes, mail slots and the like.</TE>
<TE>   Ultimately, Kreienkamp said, the Postal Service would like to
combine anthrax-busting technology with a particle-detection system
that can tell whether dangerous spores are in the mail before they
are zapped.</TE>

<HD>Californians Missing Out on Tax Incentives</HD>
<DH>Laws: State rules don't conform with new U.S. code that
allows higher contributions to savings plans. Changes sought.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KATHY M. KRISTOF</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Millions of Californians won't be able to take full advantage of new
federal tax incentives to save for retirement and their children's
education unless state lawmakers change the state's tax code.</LD>
<LD>   Several state legislators plan this week to propose bills to
resolve the issue. But the legislation would cost millions in tax
revenue and would come as California's budget is already under
strain, making passage less than a sure thing.</LD>
<LD>   Californians who want to take advantage of higher contribution
limits to 401(k) plans, individual retirement accounts, education
IRAs and other tax-advantaged savings vehicles are hamstrung, despite
last year's federal law allowing them to do so.</LD>
<TE>   Already many state employees have been notified that they can't
boost contributions to their tax-deferred retirement plans.</TE>
<TE>   "It doesn't seem right that the law was passed for all Americans
but if you live in California, you can't do it," said Rosemary Hart,
who works for the Sacramento Municipal Utility District.</TE>
<TE>   At the heart of the matter is last year's wide-ranging new federal
tax law, which slashed federal income tax rates and mandated that
most taxpayers receive a refund check from the U.S. Treasury.</TE>
<TE>   The law also boosted allowable contributions to IRAs to $3,000
this year from $2,000 last year. It raised limits for contributions
to 401(k), 403(b) and 457 retirement plans, and gave individuals who
are older than 50 the ability to contribute even more to "catch up"
on retirement savings. In addition, the law quadrupled the amount
parents could save for their children's education through education
IRAs.</TE>
<TE>   Karen Hochwald, an Orange County homemaker, was warned by her
financial planner refrain from increasing her Roth IRA contribution
to the new federal limit. "This issue affects virtually every working
person in the state," Hochwald said. "Everybody has something--either
an IRA, a Roth IRA or a 403(b). But [the state] could penalize you
for putting too much in savings."</TE>
<TE>   California is among more than a dozen states that have tax rules
that don't mesh with the new federal tax law. Workers in these states
are in a bind. They can't enjoy the boosted retirement and education
savings limits without running afoul of state law and owing more
state--and in some cases federal--income taxes.</TE>
<TE>   Worse yet, the situation in so-called nonconforming states might
affect residents of states in which the tax laws mesh, said David
Wray, president of the Profit Sharing/401(k) Council of America.</TE>
<TE>   "Because some multinational companies want uniformity in their
record keeping, they will hold off making changes in their entire
plan until the California situation is resolved," Wray said.</TE>
<TE>   "From a company point of view, the purpose of these plans is to
build a bond with employees. If you have a situation where an
employee moves, you have a very complicated communication with the
employee, who is not going to understand why [he or she] got treated
one way in Nevada and another in California."</TE>
<TE>   Savers have all year to contribute to most types of retirement
plans, and they can postpone making 2002 contributions to IRAs until
April 2003. If the state passes a conformity bill this year and makes
it retroactive--as several legislators have suggested should be the
case--the state's residents will be able to enjoy the full benefit of
boosted savings limits. However, many workers who want to change
their contribution levels now are being thwarted by employers who
consider the prospects for conformity too tenuous.</TE>
<TE>   There is some debate about exactly what might happen if an
individual contributed more to a retirement plan than state law
allowed.</TE>
<TE>   Some experts think the additional amount would simply be taxable
on state returns. In other words, with federal law allowing $3,000 in
tax-deductible IRA contributions but state law allowing just $2,000,
Californians who contributed the maximum would pay state tax on the
$1,000 difference.</TE>
<TE>   However, others believe that contributing even $500 too much to a
tax-qualified retirement plan, such as a 401(k), would cause the
entire plan to be disqualified. The result: Participants would face
state taxes not just on the $500 overage but on the entire
accumulated balance in the account. In some cases, it might make
retirement savings taxable even on federal returns.</TE>
<TE>   "If we don't conform and individuals want to save more than
California law allows, they will be double-taxed--at best," said
Assemblyman John Campbell (R-Irvine), a certified public accountant
who plans to introduce a bill Monday that would make California law
conform with the new federal law.</TE>
<TE>   "At worst, they could face a 1,000% tax rate," Campbell said.</TE>
<TE>   Even in the best of circumstances--if the additional contributions
were simply taxable on state returns--it could cause lasting
headaches, said John Scott, director of retirement policy at the
American Benefits Council in Washington.</TE>
<TE>   The amount that was taxed by the state when it was contributed
would be tax-free when withdrawn during retirement. That would
require taxpayers to maintain careful records over the years, or
decades, if they didn't want to overpay their state tax.</TE>
<TE>   If an individual retired to another state, the situation could
become even more complicated.</TE>
<TE>   "It gets pretty hairy and difficult for people and their advisors
to work through," Scott said. "But for somebody who wants to take
advantage of the increased limits in federal law, it's pretty clear
that they would be penalized."</TE>
<TE>   Bringing state tax codes into conformity with federal tax-law
changes usually is a simple matter, especially when popular programs
such as IRAs are at stake. But accomplishing it this year is less
certain, experts said. The recession has crimped tax revenue at all
levels of government, and states will take a close look at any
proposal that will cost them money.</TE>
<TE>   California would lose $44 million in 2002 if the state fully
conformed to the federal law, according to an analysis by the
Franchise Tax Board. The losses would be greater in future years.</TE>
<TE>   By law, the state's $103-billion budget, now estimated to be $12.4
billion in the red, must balance, said Sandy Harrison, assistant
director of the California Department of Finance. If the Legislature
cuts revenue by complying with the new tax law, it will need to find
other sources of revenue to make up for the loss, Harrison said.</TE>
<TE>   "It is a very difficult year to do conformity," said Assemblywoman
Ellen M. Corbett, (D-San Leandro) chairwoman of the Assembly Revenue
and Taxation Committee. "It's never easy, because it always requires
expenditure.</TE>
<TE>   "This year, being a tough budget year, the bills will have to be
crafted carefully to get a bill accepted by a majority of people."</TE>
<TE>   Wray, of the 401(k) Council, said, "In the past, you could count
on getting all of the appropriate state concurrence ... and everyone
could just go forward. Now you cannot make that presumption. If
states conform, they lose revenue. And this happens right in the
middle of an economic downturn, where states are running deficits to
begin with."</TE>
<TE>   Many experts are worried that state governments will either drag
their feet or conform with only a portion of the federal law as a way
of saving money.</TE>
<TE>   That is, in fact, what some California legislators are
considering.</TE>
<TE>   Corbett, for example, will introduce a bill this week to make
state law conform with federal retirement plan rules. But the bill
would not allow increased contributions to education IRAs. California
taxpayers are restricted to contributing no more than $500 to these
accounts, while federal law allows contributions of as much as
$2,000.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, state Sen. Jack Scott (D-Pasadena) said he also will
introduce a bill Monday that would make California law conform with
both the education and retirement plan provisions.</TE>
<TE>   California's legislative tax committees plan to hold meetings this
month to discuss various options and identify possible problems that
might result if the state doesn't conform with all provisions in the
federal law. However, any effort at conformity hinges on finding ways
to save money and pay for the changes, legislators say.</TE>
<TE>   The suggestion makes savers, such as Hochwald, burning mad.</TE>
<TE>   "What is happening here is California is trying to balance a
budget on the back of working men and women," Hochwald said.</TE>
<TE>   "Our goal is to be secure when we retire and not dependent on the
government. But California is not going along with that."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Out of Order</TE>
<TE>   Here are some of the new federal tax rules for 2002 that don't
conform with California law.</TE>
<TE>   * Annual contribution limits for individual retirement
accounts--both Roth and traditional--are raised to $3,000 from
$2,000.</TE>
<TE>   * Contribution limits for 401(k) and 403(b) plans rise to $11,000
from $10,500.</TE>
<TE>   * Maximum Simple account contributions rise to $7,000 from $6,000.</TE>
<TE>   * Maximum 457 plan deferrals go to $11,000 a year from $8,500.</TE>
<TE>   * Individuals older than 50 can make "catch-up" contributions to
their retirement plans.</TE>
<TE>   * Pension accounts are easier to move from job to job.</TE>
<TE>   * Maximum contributions to education IRAs rise to $2,000 from
$500.</TE>

<HD>Argentine Malaise May Be Contagious</HD>

<LD>Argentina, its economy collapsing, is about to drop out of the world
economy, taking with it $132 billion in debts to international banks
and governments, sizable investments from U.S. and European companies
and probably the hopes of a common market uniting all the economies
of South, Central and North America.</LD>
<LD>   Yet financial markets don't expect an Argentine bankruptcy to have
a major effect on the U.S. or other Latin American economies. And the
Bush administration is reacting coolly to raging troubles in a
country that only yesterday the U.S. held up as a model of
free-market policies. "Once Argentina has an economic plan, we will
be supportive," a U.S. Treasury spokeswoman said last week.</LD>
<LD>   But such confidence may be mistaken because Argentina is unlikely
to go quietly. Default on its debts will cause losses for U.S. and
European banks, says Walter Molano of BCP Co., a Greenwich, Conn.,
investment partnership that focuses on Latin America. FleetBoston
Financial Corp., the largest bank in New England, holds $21 billion
in Argentine loans, for example.</LD>
<TE>   U.S. companies that have invested in Argentina, from Metropolitan
Life Insurance Co., which owns pension management companies, to
Liberty Media Corp., which owns cable systems, will see the value of
their holdings reduced by a likely devaluation of the Argentine peso,
which has been pegged at one peso to the dollar for the last decade.</TE>
<TE>   Argentina's troubles will discourage lenders to and investors in
Brazil and other Latin countries. Brazil needs $25 billion a year in
foreign investment, experts say, and won't be able to get that much,
so it could be the next trouble spot in Latin America.</TE>
<TE>   Mexico, on the other hand, will be less affected by Argentina's
collapse because it now is linked to the U.S. economy through the
North American Free Trade Agreement, says Geoffrey Dennis, Latin
American equities manager at Salomon Smith Barney.</TE>
<TE>   However, the 34-nation Free Trade Area for the Americas that
President Bush proposed at the summit of Western Hemisphere leaders
in April appears dead--at least for a while.</TE>
<TE>   The FTAA already was in trouble, says Philip Potter, a Washington
lobbyist, because the Bush administration angered key members of
Congress in deals made to get fast-track trade authority in December.
And the administration angered trading partners by keeping out
Brazilian oranges to appease Florida citrus producers.</TE>
<TE>   With Argentina now about to retreat from free-trade policies, the
hemispheric vision must await a better day.</TE>
<TE>   What lies ahead? Argentina will renegotiate its loans and won't be
able to borrow abroad for a few years, so its economy will be poor
and discouraging to small and medium-size businesses. The government
will print money to pay its people, who have been rioting in the
streets because the government bars them from withdrawing their bank
deposits.</TE>
<TE>   Devaluing the currency will make Argentina's exports of beef and
grain more attractive to the world, while making imports too
expensive for Argentine consumers with reduced purchasing power. The
country of 37 million people with annual economic output of about
$300 billion--3% of the U.S. total, 38% of Brazil's--will go into
hibernation.</TE>
<TE>   A rest period away from the pressures of the global economy could
ease tensions in Argentina, a country that has known unrest for more
than 50 years, first under Juan Peron and his wife Eva, who turned
workers against the middle classes, and then under a murderous
military dictatorship.</TE>
<TE>   The last decade, with economic policies that pegged the peso to
the U.S. dollar, saw rising prosperity for a while. But then
Argentina's weak economy failed to adapt to changed world
circumstances after the Asian and Russian financial crises in 1997
and '98 and it again went into decline.</TE>
<TE>   Many of Argentina's wounds are self-inflicted, economists say. Due
to laws reflecting the country's Peronist tradition, employers must
pay workers social and pension benefits that are 50% higher than
those of other Latin countries.</TE>
<TE>   Argentina's agriculture and industry have not been innovative with
"more sophisticated products," but have stuck to exporting basic
commodities such as grain and meat, which are subject to price
competition, notes economist Manual Pastor of UC Santa Cruz.</TE>
<TE>   Yet Argentina is not alone in having inflexible labor laws,
commodity products and repeated troubles--think of Brazil's crises
and those of Peru, Venezuela and others.</TE>
<TE>   Latin American economies never seem to advance very far, in
contrast to those of the European Union, which in recent decades has
raised the economic levels of poorer nations and regions such as
southern Italy, Ireland, Portugal and Spain--the latter two now major
investors in their historic South American colonies.</TE>
<TE>   Why has Europe succeeded and the Western Hemisphere failed?
"Institutions," says Sebastian Edwards, an expert on Latin America at
UCLA's Anderson School. "Strong institutions and fiscal prudence are
key" for economic success, Edwards says. The poor nations of Europe
had to adopt the EU's strong institutions--balanced budgets, low
inflation.</TE>
<TE>   But Argentina's institutions, its civil service and judiciary are
weak. And though Argentina tied its currency to the dollar to try to
control its traditional inflation, it did not adopt strong U.S. laws
on budgeting and credit.</TE>
<TE>   Latin America can do better. Mexico is improving institutions
steadily, and ultimately all the hemisphere's countries will have to
do so if the FTAA vision is to become reality.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the scenario for Argentina's immediate future can be
either pessimistic or optimistic, says Jennifer Jimenez, manager of
emerging-market funds for Montgomery Asset Management in San
Francisco. Pessimistic would be "if Argentina goes back to indexing
wages and brings back the inflation of the 1980s," Jimenez says.</TE>
<TE>   But the optimistic scenario for a country that, after all, has a
large, educated and skilled middle class population, is "a
devaluation of 25% when all the turmoil settles down," Jimenez says.
Then, she sees Argentina returning to better credit standing and
fuller participation in the world economy in "18 to 24 months."</TE>
<TE>   In the meantime, Argentina's collapse will engender furious
debates and denunciations about globalization, the International
Monetary Fund and the rich nations and the poor.</TE>
<TE>   Will we cheer or cry for Argentina?</TE>

<HD>Don't Link Layoffs, Minimum Wage Increase</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>If the owner of Chanteclaire restaurant really intends to lay off
five people simply because of the minimum wage increase, it means he
has such a poor understanding of the economics of his business that
he deserves to fail ["Raising Minimum Wage, a Dilemma," Dec. 31].</LD>
<LD>   Raising the minimum wage has nothing to do with the number of
people he needs to run his business. The fact that he can lay off
five people means that he has been operating with five people too
many, and that would be true even if the minimum wage was not raised.
If he has five people too many, he has been wasting money for years.</LD>
<LD>   The point is that all this nonsense about minimum wage increases
causing job losses is economic nonsense. If that were true, how do
you explain what happened after the last minimum wage increase? At
that time, unemployment fell to its lowest levels in years.</LD>

<LD>My God, it's deja vu all over again! Another natural monopoly wants
to operate as "free enterprise" and set its own rates on an
indispensable service [Line Drawn in Battle Over Long-Distance," Dec.
23].</LD>
<LD>   And it is to be up to the PUC to grant or deny approval! The gang
that gave us electricity at double its former price now wants to do
the same thing with our telephone service.</LD>
<LD>   Jack Morrow</LD>
<TE>   Long Beach</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   You hit the nail on the head to identify SBC Pacific Bell as a
near-monopoly player in supplying local telephone service.</TE>
<TE>   However, I was amused to read that PacBell has a "stranglehold on
just about every telecommunications service."</TE>
<TE>   What are your examples? Pay phones? Very few still belong to
PacBell! Phone books? I receive them constantly from various sources,
whether I like it or not.</TE>
<TE>   Corporate phone systems? PacBell has been a minority player in
these products since 1984, having lost most of the market share for
end-user equipment long ago. (Better products are widespread now.)</TE>
<TE>   411 directory assistance? That's still run by PacBell and Verizon,
but numerous other inexpensive directory services proliferate on
CD-ROMs and Web sites.</TE>
<TE>   DSL Internet access? Lots of competitors jumped in, offered
unrealistic discounts and went belly-up. Most of the surviving
Internet providers still choose to lease lines from SBC PacBell
rather than build their own.</TE>
<TE>   Of the examples you give, local phone service is about the only
thing still largely controlled by PacBell, the biggest supplier. Two
reasons: One, local phone service requires a physical infrastructure
that is costly to operate, without much profit. (The profit comes
from the add-on services.) The other reason, as you mentioned, is the
size of the investment: PacBell (and most other local phone
companies) built their networks over the last 75 years and nobody can
afford to duplicate those systems.</TE>
<TE>   It's true that competitors should be given access to PacBell
facilities at a reasonable wholesale cost, but when they see the real
cost, it becomes apparent that there's not much profit in local phone
service. The real profit is in long-distance, and the folks at AT&amp;T
and MCI know it.</TE>

<HD>Forget Inheritance and Plan for Mother's Future Financial
Needs</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LIZ PULLIAM WESTON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Question: My mother, who is 62, lives on disability. She is selling
her house and probably will receive about $290,000 after commissions
and expenses. My question--and it's a big question because this is
all the savings she will have until the end of her days--is what
should she put her money into? Certificates of deposit, annuities,
bonds? A corollary to this question is: What would be the most
intelligent arrangement for her to be able to leave something for me
and my children when she passes away?</LD>
<LD>   Answer: You have a lot on your plate right now when it comes to
helping your mother. So let's make some more room by removing one
issue you probably don't need to worry about: your potential
inheritance.</LD>
<LD>   That money may seem like a lot to you and your mom, but it's
really not a lot to live on when you consider that your mother is
relatively young and that she may live 30 more years. A few years in
a nursing home could wipe out her whole kitty.</LD>
<TE>   The AARP, formerly the American Assn. of Retired Persons, recently
conducted a survey that showed many people vastly underestimate how
much long-term care costs, and vastly overestimate the amount of
government aid available. The reality is that nursing homes cost
$40,000 to $70,000 a year or more, and the government pays for such
care only for the indigent.</TE>
<TE>   Your mom probably will net less from her home sale than you
think.  Each taxpayer is allowed to exclude up to $250,000 in home
sale profits from income taxes, so your mom might have to pay capital
gains taxes on any profit exceeding that cap.</TE>
<TE>   Your mom is in a difficult position. She'll need some growth to be
able to maintain her purchasing power as she grows older. But because
this is all the money she has, she also needs safety. Her best bet
may be a diversified portfolio of mutual funds that's heavier on the
bond and cash investments than on stocks, or a few stock mutual funds
along with a portfolio of CDs with differing maturities.</TE>
<TE>   Tread carefully if you're considering annuities. One type of
annuity--an immediate annuity--can offer your mom a guaranteed stream
of income for life, which might be a good thing. In exchange for
giving an insurance company a lump sum, she would receive monthly
checks for the rest of her life. But she typically would lose the
ability to tap her funds in an emergency. Also, the payments might
not keep up with inflation, and the income ends when she dies.</TE>
<TE>   The other type of annuity--a deferred annuity--could be even more
problematic. Instead of getting a a check every month, her money
would be invested tax-deferred for the future. But chances are her
income is too low for her to get much from the tax benefits of a
deferred annuity, and she probably would face surrender penalties
that could make it difficult for her to access her money in an
emergency. For more information on annuities, visit www.help4srs.org.</TE>
<TE>   You and your mom should talk with a qualified financial planner
who can review her situation in depth and offer specific suggestions,
including the pros and cons of various investments. You can find
information on finding a financial planner at www.la times.com/money.</TE>
<TE>   If your mom is able to leave you anything, she can do so fairly
easily by making you the "pay-on-death" beneficiary on her accounts.
Assets left through a pay-on-death designation avoid probate, the
court process otherwise used to settle estates. You should have no
trouble getting a pay-on-death designation form from a bank, and many
brokerage firms and mutual funds also provide the forms. In
California and Missouri, she could leave you her car using a
pay-on-death form.</TE>
<TE>   For more information on probate and estate planning, read "Plan
Your Estate" by Denis Clifford and Cora Jordan.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Assess Need Before Buying Insurance</TE>
<TE>   Q: My wife and I purchased whole life insurance policies in
July.  Our combined annual premium is $651. The death benefit on me
is $8,900. My wife's death benefit is $10,647. Are these good policies
for us or would term insurance be better? I am 46 and my wife is 45.</TE>
<TE>   A: If you really need life insurance, it's hard to imagine that
those amounts would be sufficient.</TE>
<TE>   Your first task is to determine whether you actually need
insurance. Do you have minor children or elderly parents who rely on
your income? Would your spouse be able to pay the mortgage and other
bills without your income--and vice versa? Are you likely to face a
big estate tax bill?</TE>
<TE>   If your answer to those questions is no, then you may not need
life insurance.</TE>
<TE>   If your answer to any of those questions is yes, then you should
determine how much insurance you need. Visit www.la times.com/money
and click on Insurance 101 for a guide.</TE>
<TE>   You may find that you need more insurance than you can
afford if you stick with your whole-life policy. In that case, you
should explore term insurance, which provides coverage without the
investment component that's built into the cash-value policies you
have.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   IRS Not Generous With Gift Deduction</TE>
<TE>   Q: We have seven married children and 18 grandchildren. Gift
buying is overwhelming, so we send cash for birthdays, Christmas and
special days such as baptisms. This easily runs $4,500 a year. Can
this be used as tax-deductible gifts on our income tax?</TE>
<TE>   A: Oh, wouldn't that be lovely? But no, gifts to your family
are not considered to be tax-deductible charitable contributions, no

<HD>Equity-Indexed Annuities Appeal to the Squeamish</HD>
<DH>A little-known investment product offers a guarantee: You
can't lose principal. But yields are lower.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KATHY M. KRISTOF</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>At first glance, it seems like a case of extremely bad timing.</LD>
<LD>   Tom Gochenour invested the bulk of his inheritance in the stock
market Sept. 1, then stock prices plunged after the Sept. 11
terrorist attacks. But the value of Gochenour's inheritance didn't
fall at all. The key: a little-known investment product called an
equity-indexed annuity.</LD>
<LD>   "An equity-indexed annuity provides a means to participate in the
market with no downside risk," said Tom McNeily, owner of McNeily &amp;
Associates, an insurance brokerage in Hinsdale, Ill. "I've become
really sold on them in the last few years."</LD>
<TE>   Equity-indexed annuities are a complicated hybrid product and
aren't for everyone, McNeily said. People who can handle market
volatility are likely to earn more in the long run by investing
directly in the market--through stock mutual funds, for instance.</TE>
<TE>   But indexed annuities provide an option--albeit a lower-yielding
one--for those who can't stomach a loss in their savings.</TE>
<TE>   "I am 52 years old and this is my retirement money," said
Gochenour, a pharmacist who lives in Chicago. "I sleep a lot easier
knowing that the principal is protected."</TE>
<TE>   Like all annuities, equity-indexed annuities combine insurance
with an investment component. In this case, the insurance element
provides a simple guarantee: You can't lose principal, and in some
cases, you can't lose past years' investment returns, either.</TE>
<TE>   The returns on these annuities are loosely tied to a stock market
index--most commonly the Standard &amp; Poor's 500. However, the investor
does not get the full return of the index.</TE>
<TE>   Depending on the annuity selected, the investor will get either a
portion of what the index gained--40% to 90% of the rise in the
index--or they might get a return that's based on the percentage gain
in the index, minus a margin. (In other words, if the index rose 12%,
investors might earn 9%, or the index minus a three-percentage-point
margin.)</TE>
<TE>   In return for giving up some of the investment potential of the
index itself, the investor gets a guarantee that the worst his
investments can do over a specified period is earn a zero return.</TE>
<TE>   The viability of these products lies in the details, said Jack
Marrion, founder of the Advantage Group, a St. Louis insurance
research and consulting firm. Some index annuities are a great deal
for investors; others provide substandard returns.</TE>
<TE>   The average annual return of these investments has been about 8.7%
over the last five years, Marrion said. The S&amp;P 500, the most
commonly used stock market index, returned almost 11% a year over the
same period.</TE>
<TE>   But the gulf between annuities, with the best returns versus the
worst returns, is wide. In 1997, when the S&amp;P 500 rose 31%, the
best-returning annuity paid 38%, he said, and the worst paid a mere
6%.</TE>
<TE>   (It's worth noting that not all annuities are tied to the S&amp;P.
Many allow investors to put some money into several indexes at
once--for instance a small-cap index, the S&amp;P and a fixed-income
fund. Marrion's figures represent the best and worst the various
options could do.)</TE>
<TE>   When the market soured in 2000 and the S&amp;P 500 fell 9%, a handful
of index annuities paid as much as 12%, while many paid nothing.</TE>
<TE>   To tell good index annuities from bad, experts suggest that
investors look for a few key elements:</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Guarantee</TE>
<TE>   The insurance component of equity-indexed annuities guarantees
that the investor won't lose principal. But does it also insure
against losing investment returns accumulated over the years?</TE>
<TE>   The answer depends on the annuity, Marrion said. Some annuities
reset the principal value each year. Consequently, the amount of
principal that's protected rises every year that the investment
produces a gain.</TE>
<TE>   However, another type of equity-indexed annuity uses a
"point-to-point" formula, which resets the principal value every few
years. The exact number of years can vary. There can be a three-year,
five-year or even 10-year gap between reset points.</TE>
<TE>   Because the insurance company is taking somewhat less risk by
making fewer guarantees with "point-to-point" annuities, they
sometimes are more generous when formulating an investor's return.</TE>
<TE>   However, it also means that several years' worth of investment
returns could be wiped out in a bad year.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Investment Return</TE>
<TE>   Some companies have a formula that never changes to determine
investor returns. These companies may say, for instance, that the
investor will always get 60% of the rise in the index to which the
annuity is tied.</TE>
<TE>   That would mean that if the S&amp;P 500 index gained 20%, the investor
would get a 12% return. (That's the 20% gain times 0.60.) If the
index gained 40%, the investor would get 24%.</TE>
<TE>   But many index annuity contracts allow the insurer to change the
return formula, often called the "participation rate," each year.
With these variable-formula annuities, the investor could get 60% of
the index return one year and 70%--or 40%--the next.</TE>
<TE>   Annual changes aren't necessarily bad--if they go in the right
direction, Marrion noted. But companies sometimes start with a
generous investment formula and make it stingier each year. Because
there are often penalties for cashing out of annuities early, it's
tough for an investor to flee.</TE>
<TE>   It's worth noting that although other types of annuities have
visible fees, the fees on an indexed annuity are folded into the
"margin" or "participation rate."</TE>
<TE>   In other words, if the annuity company is giving you the index
minus three percentage points, that includes the insurer's profit
margin. If the insurer boosts the margin or cuts the investor's
participation rate, they are effectively boosting the participant's
fees and consequently reducing the investor's return.</TE>
<TE>   If the annuity allows annual changes, there's no way to know how
the insurer will treat the investor in the future.</TE>
<TE>   However, some companies that have been offering these products for
several years have established records, Marrion said. Those that have
treated their policyholders the best over the years are on an "honor
roll" on Marrion's Web site at www.indexannuity.org.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Surrender Fees</TE>
<TE>   Annuities typically impose an exit fee on anyone who tries to cash
out early. On equity-indexed annuities, these surrender fees are
often high--10% or more--and long-term. Some products charge
surrender fees to anyone who cashes out within the first five years,
while other products have surrender fees that linger for more than a
decade.</TE>
<TE>   Surrender fees are levied for two main reasons: To pay the
insurance agent a commission and to deter the investor from trading.</TE>
<TE>   Investors should carefully match their goals with the duration of
the surrender fee, Marrion said.</TE>
<TE>   In other words, if you need cash from the annuity within five
years, find an annuity with surrender fees that expire before that
point--or policies that won't penalize you for taking the money
you'll need. (Many annuities allow investors to withdraw up to 10% a
year without surrender fees.)</TE>
<TE>   Naturally, all other things being equal, the best surrender fees
are small and of short duration.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Options</TE>
<TE>   Equity-indexed annuities sometimes come with attractive bells and
whistles. Some, for instance, allow investors to switch among
different investment options--perhaps an S&amp;P index, a small-company
stock index and a fixed-income fund that isn't tied to stock
returns--at regular intervals.</TE>
<TE>   The ability to switch to a fixed-income fund is one reason some
investors in these annuities earned generous returns even when the
stock market was tanking.</TE>
<TE>   Marrion believes it's a valuable option that investors should seek
when choosing an equity-indexed annuity.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Rising Popularity</TE>
<TE>Sales of indexed annuities rose sharply in recent years as
risk-averse investors sought protection from volatile markets.</TE>

<HD>Grocers Try Fresh Ideas to Win Back Shoppers</HD>
<DH>Retail: Supermarkets are launching price wars and stocking
non-food items to lure customers from big discounters.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MELINDA FULMER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Under pressure from Wal-Mart Stores Inc., Costco Wholesale Corp. and
other discounters, supermarkets are launching the kind of war
consumers love--a price war.</LD>
<LD>   Kroger Co., owner of Southern California's Ralphs grocery chain,
fired the first round Dec. 11, announcing it will slash prices on
selected items to defend its declining market share.</LD>
<LD>   Safeway Inc., the parent of Vons, seconded the motion, saying it
had lowered profit projections and earmarked a large pool of funds
for discounts and promotions to keep shoppers from defecting to the
big discounters.</LD>
<TE>   The news highlights the squeeze supermarkets are feeling from
discounters, membership clubs and even drugstores as consumers search
for the best values.</TE>
<TE>   Double coupons, it seems, just aren't enough for some shoppers.</TE>
<TE>   "They never add up to much, and they are for things we don't use,"
said Jessica Garcia, with her two young sons in tow at a Los Angeles
Costco.</TE>
<TE>   Kroger and Safeway executives declined to be specific about which
prices on everyday items will come down and by how much. However,
analysts expect lower prices on stock-up items such as cereal and
detergent.</TE>
<TE>   They also forecast more coupons, perhaps even quadruple coupon
specials, and two-for-one deals in coming months to win back more
shoppers such as Garcia.</TE>
<TE>   And expect to see some nontraditional supermarket merchandise too.
During the holiday season, for instance, Safeway boosted its bottom
line by offering gift certificates to Nordstrom Inc. stores, cheap
DVD players and a selection of toys.</TE>
<TE>   Safeway declined to comment on the profitability of its holiday
merchandise, other than saying the items were "well received" by its
customers.</TE>
<TE>   Wal-Mart officials, meanwhile, seemed unperturbed by Kroger's
announcement and said the 2,700-store chain is willing and able to
defend the "We sell for less" claim that is written across its giant
stores.</TE>
<TE>   "We won't let ourselves be beat," Wal-Mart spokesman Tom Williams
said, even if that means sacrificing some of its profit margin.</TE>
<TE>   In its fiscal third quarter ended Oct. 31, Wal-Mart's gross profit
margin declined a third of a percentage point, after dipping slightly
in its second quarter, mainly because of price-cutting in its grocery
aisles.</TE>
<TE>   However, with more people coming into the stores, sales for the
quarter jumped 15.5% to $52.7 billion and net income rose 8.2% to a
record $1.5 billion.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Smaller Retailers Caught in Middle of Price War</TE>
<TE>   Wal-Mart can afford to win a price war, analysts said. And
although supermarket executives said they are trying to win back
sales lost to Wal-Mart, it's the weaker discounters, such as Kmart
Corp. and regional supermarket chains, that will suffer.</TE>
<TE>   "Smaller retailers are getting demolished," Mark Husson, analyst
with Merrill Lynch Global Securities, said in a recent report on the
battle between Wal-Mart and supermarkets.</TE>
<TE>   The reality is, Husson said, the top three supermarket
chains--Kroger, Safeway and Albertson's Inc.--have seen only minute
dips in market share since Wal-Mart moved into their business in the
mid-1990s. Despite its low prices, Wal-Mart commands just a 6.7%
share of retail grocery sales in the top 100 U.S. markets in which it
operates, compared with a combined 68% share for the top three
supermarket chains.</TE>
<TE>   In Southern California, Ralphs, Vons and Albertson's control 66%
of the market, according to supermarket data firm Trade Dimensions.
Safeway officials think that share could grow, much as it has in
Europe.</TE>
<TE>   Nearby supermarkets lost market share when a new Wal-Mart opened,
but most of the loss was regained a year later, when the novelty had
worn off and shoppers retreated to familiar shopping patterns, said
Melissa Plaisance, Safeway's vice president of finance.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Supermarkets Dealing With More Competition</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, for all the talk about Wal-Mart encroaching on their turf,
these chains are adding more food retailing space than Wal-mart,
Kmart and Target Corp. combined, Husson said.</TE>
<TE>   They are expanding at double the growth rate of the industry's
typical 1% to 1.5%, forcing out smaller chains with older stores and
stealing customers from one another.</TE>
<TE>   Still, there's no question that the competitive pressure has been
turned up on supermarkets as more types of retailers, from Target to
drug chain Rite Aid Corp.,   are using cheap food to draw more
customers into their stores.</TE>
<TE>   "Our food business has grown significantly over the last year and
we expect it to continue to grow," Rite Aid spokeswoman Sarah Datz
said. Shoppers can pick up milk, eggs, soda, bread, cereal, frozen
dinners, canned goods and pet food at most Rite Aid stores.</TE>
<TE>   Costco, which didn't sell fresh food until 14 years ago, counts
food as a $4-billion business, or about 11% of its sales.</TE>
<TE>   "Food is actually leading the pack now," said Richard Galanti,
Costco's chief financial officer.</TE>
<TE>   Over the last several months as the economy has taken a hit,
jewelry, electronics and apparel sales have slumped, he said, but
"food has held its own," and the company has expanded its meat,
produce and deli sections.</TE>
<TE>   Wal-Mart also has said it intends to increase its food business.
Grocery sales at Wal-Mart's 1,060 super-centers are growing at double
the rate of its overall business.</TE>
<TE>   The company plans to open 185 of these grocery/discount stores
next year, as well as a number of smaller grocery-only stores it
calls Neighborhood Markets.</TE>
<TE>   To compete, supermarkets are trying to become more of a one-stop
shop, adding new items to boost the bottom line.</TE>
<TE>   Safeway stocked a selection of about 100 inexpensive toys chosen
by KB Toys, such as the Fisher-Price Cash Register, the Barbie Beach
Cruiser and a Hot Wheels Car Wash.</TE>
<TE>   "Supermarkets are always trying to look for opportunities in
nonfood categories," said KB Chief Executive Michael Glazer. "We can
provide them with exclusive items that they can't get anywhere else
and use our purchasing leverage to provide them with values that they
couldn't get themselves."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Selection, Quality and Service Are Keys</TE>
<TE>   Many analysts and supermarket executives say supermarkets should
stick to what they do best--food.</TE>
<TE>   Better produce aisles, deli and butcher counters could be more
effective than general merchandise in boosting sales.</TE>
<TE>   "That's what our customers come to us for," said Larry Johnston,
chairman and chief executive of Albertson's. "We're going to make it
more attractive to them."</TE>
<TE>   Although many smaller chains, such as Stater Bros. Markets,
acknowledge that they can't beat Wal-Mart's prices, they can survive
and even thrive by offering customers selection, quality and service,
along with a quicker trip in and out of the store.</TE>
<TE>   "Our customers tell us they want a full-service shopping
experience," said Jack Brown, chairman and chief executive of Stater
Bros. "They don't have to touch a thing once they hit the check
stands. We unload the carts and take the groceries out to their car."</TE>
<TE>   Although many shoppers hit Wal-Mart a couple of times a month to
stock up on pet food, detergent or other items, many say it's no
replacement for a conventional supermarket.</TE>
<TE>   "I needed honey, so I picked up some here," said Monique Barron
while shopping in the Panorama City Wal-Mart with her 2-year-old son.
The low prices are nice, she said. But, "this is Wal-Mart, it's not
for food. It's for other things."</TE>

<LD>Toasting an End to the Recession</LD>
<LD>   The new year began on a somewhat hopeful note, as two key economic
indicators suggested the recession is winding down.</LD>
<LD>   The pace of layoffs after Sept. 11 slackened in December, but the
unemployment rate jumped to 5.8% in December, its highest level since
April 1995.</LD>
<TE>   The number of workers on U.S. payrolls outside the farm sector
fell a seasonally adjusted 124,000 in December, after a 371,000 drop
in November.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the nation's disastrous slide in manufacturing may be
coming to an end as the latest figures show the decline is slowing.</TE>
<TE>   The December report from the Institute for Supply Management said
its purchasing managers index rose to 48.2, the highest level for the
gauge since October 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Most analysts said they expect few manufacturers to add workers to
their payrolls any time soon, and that the nation's unemployment rate
should continue to climb for several months.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Traders in a Buying Mood</TE>
<TE>   Wall Street saw the new year get off to a good start last week,
raising hopes that the market may be ready to end its two-year losing
streak.</TE>
<TE>   Fittingly, 2001 ended on a sour note Monday with a sharp New
Year's Eve sell-off. But after taking Tuesday off, traders came back
in a buying mood.</TE>
<TE>   Buoyed by hints that the economy may be stirring from its
recessionary depths, and lacking any downbeat news, investors pushed
stock prices higher for the rest of the week, led by tech companies
such as Intel Corp. and Oracle Systems Corp.</TE>
<TE>   For the week, the Dow Jones industrial average rose 1.2%, closing
solidly above the 10,000 mark.</TE>
<TE>   The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index gained 1% and the Nasdaq composite
index jumped 3.6%--bringing its post-Sept. 11 gain to 45%.</TE>

<TE>   Light Trucks Pass Cars</TE>
<TE>   Pickups, sport-utility vehicles and minivans outsold passenger
cars in 2001 for the first time, thanks in part to unprecedented
deals in the months after the September terrorist attacks.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. vehicle sales defied expectations of a year ago and soared to
their second-highest level in 2001, but some analysts say the
incentive-driven sales surge in the fourth quarter may have come at
the expense of sales in 2002.</TE>
<TE>   General Motors Corp., which initiated no-interest financing and
saw the benefits from it, said last week that it's starting a new
incentive program: $2,002 cash back on purchases and leases.</TE>
<TE>   Because vehicles in the light- truck category accounted for more
than half of the U.S. market, at about 51%, auto makers continue to
pour resources into the development of new trucks.</TE>
<TE>   A spate of new SUVs are to come, including the all-new Lincoln
Navigator to be unveiled this week at the Los Angeles Auto Show, and
new models from Ford, Volvo, Lexus, Land Rover and Hummer at the
North American International Auto Show this week in Detroit.</TE>

<TE>   Finally Getting Out of Town</TE>
<TE>   In what is being interpreted as signs of a rebound, some of the
country's major tourist centers and attractions received a welcomed
jolt in attendance over the holidays.</TE>
<TE>   Fueled by heavy discounting, rising consumer confidence and plain
old restlessness, theme parks in California and Florida reported
packed crowds. Officials in Las Vegas said the arrival of some
300,000 visitors pushed the city's hotel occupancy rate to 97% during
the extended New Year's weekend.</TE>
<TE>   Hawaii, which has been devastated by a drop in tourism since Sept.
11, during Christmas week managed to attract 90% of the previous
year's total of visitors, tourism officials said.</TE>
<TE>   Although analysts remained cautious about the near-term outlook
for travel and tourism, they said the unexpectedly strong holiday
activity reflects slow but steady recovery in the tourism industry.</TE>

<TE>   Attention: Kmart  Stockholders</TE>
<TE>   An analyst's report about the financial viability of discount
retailer Kmart Corp. caused the stock to hit new lows last week.</TE>
<TE>   The plunge was the latest in a series of troubles plaguing Kmart,
which continues to be dogged by dirty stores, poor inventory
controls, slow apparel sales and increased competition.</TE>
<TE>   The Troy, Mich.-based chain's same-store sales declined in October
and November, falling below the company's reduced expectations,
despite its prominent position in the discount sector--one of the
hottest retailing groups since the terrorist attacks.</TE>
<TE>   The sell-off began after the release of a report by Prudential
Securities analyst Wayne Hood, who took the unusual step of warning
about a possible Chapter 11 filing if Kmart fails to boost sales in
the first half of 2002.</TE>
<TE>   Hood also issued a "sell" rating on the stock--another rarity
among Wall Street analysts. Kmart officials, however, dismissed
suggestions of a bankruptcy filing, saying the firm has plenty of
financial resources.</TE>
<TE>   On Friday, Kmart stock closed at $4.71 on the New York Stock
Exchange, down 13% this year.</TE>

<TE>   E-Day Dawns in Europe</TE>
<TE>   Some described it as "euphoria," the near-flawless launch of the
European currency that more than 300 million Europeans adopted as
their common currency.</TE>
<TE>   The introduction of euro notes and coins is the tangible
fulfillment of greater unity and integration of the Continent.</TE>
<TE>   Getting the money into their hands was a signal event for
Europeans, but the world's largest exchange of currency appeared to
be seamless.</TE>
<TE>   Though many Europeans continued to bemoan the loss of their
national currencies, the euro enjoyed a modest rise in
popularity--and value--amid the final countdown.</TE>
<TE>   It first began trading at a value of $1.17 to the dollar, but fell
to 89 cents in New York by week's end.</TE>

<TE>   Taiwan Joins WTO Club</TE>
<TE>   Taiwan formally joined the World Trade Organization after a
decade-long bid to enter the global trading club.</TE>
<TE>   Although Taiwan, the world's 14th-largest trading economy, has
fought for admission since 1990, it will bring mixed blessings to the
island of 23 million people.</TE>
<TE>   WTO membership will mean mostly cheaper prices for consumers, but
it is certain to hurt agriculture and labor-intensive industries and
to cause already record-high unemployment levels to rise even
further.</TE>
<TE>   But its WTO membership is raising hopes for better ties with its
giant neighbor China.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Enron in the Hot Seat</TE>
<TE>   A key Senate committee will use its subpoena powers to investigate
the collapse of Enron Corp.</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Carl Levin (D-Mich.), chairman of the Permanent Subcommittee
on Investigations, said he intends to subpoena company documents for
an examination of the conduct of Enron officers and the company's
auditor that led to the filing of the largest bankruptcy in U.S.
history.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Sen. Joseph I. Lieberman (D-Conn.), chairman of the
Governmental Affairs Committee, plans to start hearings Jan. 24 that
will focus on whether government agencies, such as the Securities and
Exchange Commission, could have done more to protect employees and
investors hurt by Enron's financial meltdown.</TE>
<TE>   At least five other congressional investigations are planned or
underway.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Preserving Affordable Rental Housing</TE>
<TE>   A Southland nonprofit organization has raised a $15-million
private-investment pool to purchase California rental housing at risk
of being removed from federal subsidy programs.</TE>
<TE>   National Housing Development Corp. officials said they believe
their new fund is the first of its kind in the nation to draw on
private dollars to preserve affordable housing that is increasingly
"flipping" to market rates.</TE>
<TE>   The fund promises investors an 8% annual average return.</TE>
<TE>   The group secured $13.5 million from nine financial institutions,
which will receive federal Community Reinvestment Act credit for the
three- to five-year investments, NHDC spokesman Bernard Sandalow
said.</TE>

<HD>The U.S. Adoption Snake Pit</HD>
<DH>A bureaucrat's stinging words lead to a bigger issue.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN BALZAR</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In our tumultuous times, there are smaller matters too. They burn
with fury just beneath the headlines. This is one of them. It has
caught my attention because the sensibilities of a group of children
are involved. Their place in our society has been called into
question, needlessly so. And tens of thousands of good-hearted people
are alarmed, angry and downcast.</LD>
<LD>   It also caught my attention because I have a personal stake in the
matter.</LD>
<LD>   Today, I write directly to those people who feel wronged, and
indirectly to those many others who reflexively assume the worst from
our government.</LD>
<TE>   This is all the doing of a faceless man in Washington who sits
atop one of our most coldblooded bureaucracies. He is Commissioner
James Ziglar of the Immigration and Naturalization Service. Four days
before Christmas, he demeaned thousands of abandoned and orphaned
children and their would-be parents.</TE>
<TE>   He issued a press release. He worked until 9 p.m. to get it
written. It spoke to the 20,000-plus Americans who are in line to
adopt children from abroad this year. And the 20,000 more behind
them, and so on.</TE>
<TE>   The statement said that U.S. officials were concerned about
baby-stealing and brokering by Cambodian adoption facilitators. He
announced that he was approving pending adoptions from that country
through February for the sake of families who were caught in the
middle, but no more until Cambodia can prove that its system is
honest.</TE>
<TE>   Then he stuck his nose into business that was none of his official
business. "I would like to take this opportunity," he said, "to
remind families considering adoption that there are many deserving
children who are U.S. citizens that are in need of loving homes."</TE>
<TE>   This is, for a fact, the truth. There are perhaps 117,000 such
children at this very moment. But his words landed like a slap. They
disparaged families who have reached abroad to many countries for
children who are also deserving of love and homes. The nation's
ambassador to immigrants stirred the pot of xenophobia. Adoptive
parents, wound tight with emotion, exploded in dismay.</TE>
<TE>   I called and confronted Ziglar 10 days after his press release. He
said this, "I never meant to offend. Xenophobia is not one of my
problems." He said he hasn't been sleeping so well.</TE>
<TE>   "I stick by what I said. There are children here who need homes.
But I am not against international adoptions," he said.</TE>
<TE>   At this moment, we have a choice. Believe the worst or hope for
the best? I'll take the risky path. Ziglar's response to criticism
was not to back away but to listen. I heard heart in his voice. I
think he deserves encouragement. And either way, Ziglar turns out to
have done something important. He stumbled into a subject that is too
touchy for others.</TE>
<TE>   Ziglar has learned in short order what tens of thousands of
Americans have discovered by bitter experience: The U.S. adoption
process is a mess. The adoption of infants outside the foster care
system can be a snake pit of lawyers, money, wheeling and dealing,
conflicting and ever-changing laws state by state. At least
sometimes, it is wholly unsavory, profit-motivated and fraught with
disappointment. Adoptions from the foster care system go more
smoothly in general but parents usually must forgo the chance to
raise a child from infancy.</TE>
<TE>   Ziglar summed up the process: "It stinks."</TE>
<TE>   The commissioner said he understands. What motivates many
Americans to look abroad is that many countries provide the
administrative certainty that the U.S. system cannot. That, and the
fact that love should know no borders.</TE>
<TE>   I am familiar with China, which, in contrast to Cambodia, has a
respected and straightforward national agency for adoption. The
yearlong process weighs the character and maturity of would-be
adoptive parents. U.S. officials understand this system and would do
well to establish a similar one here, eliminating private lawyers and
deal-making and putting the needs of children foremost.</TE>
<TE>   Ziglar put it in these words: "This is a democracy. Americans
ought to rise up and raise hell and demand better."</TE>
<TE>   It is easy to demonize those in government. It's harder to extend
them our trust. In this case, why not take the chance and meet Ziglar
halfway?</TE>
<TE>   When I travel to China in a few months to pick up my baby
daughter, I expect my country's immigration service to welcome a new
U.S. citizen with a smile. And meanwhile, I'll join him in agitating
to fix things here at home. If he'll stick with it and we make
progress, I promise: We'll add on a bedroom for my daughter's new
brother.</TE>

<HD>Steel Ourselves Against Tariffs to Save Jobs</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JIM KOLBE</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>American manufacturers in a number of industries are being forced to
cut costs and staff. We may hate the word "recession," but the
reality is that the economy and those who toil to make it work are
hurting. Yet even as Congress and the Bush administration try to find
ways to improve the economy, such as the economic stimulus package,
others want to build trade walls that would be counterproductive to
our goal of restarting the U.S. economy.</LD>
<LD>   The case of steel imports provides a good example of the
challenges facing those who advocate free trade in Washington. The
International Trade Commission's recent investigation into steel
imports already has determined that, in a number of product
categories, imports have injured domestic steel producers. Last
month, the trade panel decided on measures to remedy these injuries
and forwarded these recommendations to President Bush, who is
expected to decide on protective measures by mid-February.</LD>
<LD>   The six-member U.S. panel was guided in its decisions by U.S.
trade law, which says any final remedy imposed by the president must
"provide greater economic and social benefit than costs."</LD>
<TE>   During its deliberations, the panel was asked by domestic
integrated steel producers to apply tariffs of up to 50% on steel
imports.</TE>
<TE>   But many of the steel producers asking for tariffs have failed to
keep up with domestic and international competitors by not
modernizing, cutting costs, consolidating plants or shutting down
unprofitable operations. These companies seeking protection employ
about 160,000 workers.</TE>
<TE>   On the other hand, there are more than 100,000 U.S. businesses
that consume steel imports. These businesses employ 12.8 million
Americans and rely on getting raw material and other products at
globally competitive prices to compete with foreign interests.</TE>
<TE>   If the price of steel imports increases because of a tariff of 40%
to 50%, 30,000 Americans who work for steel-using companies could
lose their jobs. Many steel-consuming companies will go out of
business or move offshore. Quotas and other measures could have even
more damaging effects on steel-using industries.</TE>
<TE>   These companies would not be the only downstream victims of any
tariff. All Americans, as consumers of steel-containing
products--cars, washing machines and other appliances, truck brakes,
fire extinguishers, bridges and other new construction--will pay an
invisible "tax" on these items. We in effect would be forced to
protect companies that can't compete in the global economy.</TE>
<TE>   It is clear that some domestic steel producers need help to get
out from under the costs of the health care and retirement packages
of steelworkers. Yet there are measures that would go far toward
solving the problem without affecting the price of steel imports.</TE>

<HD>Aim the War on Terror at Militant Islam</HD>
<DH>Moderate Muslims can be key allies in this global effort.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DANIEL PIPES</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Who are we fighting? Two main culprits have emerged since Sept. 11:
terrorism and Islam. The truth, more subtle, lies between the two--a
terroristic version of Islam.</LD>
<LD>   * Terrorism. The establishment--politicians, academics, religious
leaders, journalists, along with many Muslims--says terrorism is the
enemy. It is carried out by "evildoers" who have nothing to do with
Islam but adhere to some murky cult of terrorism.</LD>
<LD>   Secretary of State Colin Powell summarized this view by declaring
that the acts of Sept. 11 "should not be seen as something done by
Arabs or Islamics; it is something that was done by terrorists."</LD>
<TE>   Pretending that the enemy is "terrorism" unconnected to Islam is
appealing because it finesses some delicate questions about Islam,
thereby making it easier to build an international coalition or
minimize domestic repercussions.</TE>
<TE>   But it makes no sense at all. The Taliban government, Al Qaeda,
Osama bin Laden, John Walker Lindh, Richard Reid and Zacarias
Moussaoui--all are fervent Muslims acting on behalf of their
religion.</TE>
<TE>   More, they have found wide support across the Muslim world
(remember those huge demonstrations waving pictures of Bin Laden in
September?). Terrorists they are, to be sure, but terrorists with a
specific set of beliefs.</TE>
<TE>   Blaming "terrorism" means ignoring those beliefs--at great cost.
If the enemy consists of terrorists "motivated by hate," as President
Bush put it, what can one do other than kill them?</TE>
<TE>   Hate lacks an ideology or intellectual framework that one can
refute. The West is left with nothing but guns to protect itself from
the next assault. There can be no strategy for victory, only tactics
to stave off harm.</TE>
<TE>   * Islam. The Western "street" prefers to see the problem lying
with the Islamic religion. In this view, Arabs and Muslims have been
the leading enemy of Christians for more than a millennium, remain so
now and will long continue to fill this role.</TE>
<TE>   This enmity stems from the Koran itself and so is immutable, say
spokesmen for this argument, who tend to be political conservatives
or evangelicals. This too does not hold. If Muslims by nature are
hostile, how does one explain Turkey, with its militantly secular
culture and abiding good relations with the West?</TE>
<TE>   If all Muslims accept Koranic precepts, how does this account for
the tens of thousands of Algerians who lost their lives resisting
Islamic rule?</TE>
<TE>   And if Islam is the problem, then there is no possible strategy
for winning. It implies that the billion or so Muslims--including
millions living in the West--are immutable enemies. They can only be
converted from Islam or quarantined, two thoroughly unrealistic
programs.</TE>
<TE>   Insisting on Islam as the enemy means a permanent clash of
civilizations that cannot be won.</TE>
<TE>   Fingering terrorism or Islam, in short, neither explains the
current problem nor offers a solution.</TE>
<TE>   There is third way of approaching the question, which satisfies
both these requirements.</TE>
<TE>   Islam itself--the centuries-old faith--is not the issue but one
extremist variant of it is. Militant Islam derives from Islam but is
a misanthropic, misogynist, triumphalist, millennarian, anti-modern,
anti-Christian, anti-Semitic, terroristic, jihadistic and suicidal
version of it.</TE>
<TE>   Fortunately, it appeals to only about 10% to 15% of Muslims,
meaning that a substantial majority would prefer a more moderate
version.</TE>
<TE>   This implies a simple and effective strategy: weaken militant
Islam around the world and strengthen the moderate alternatives to
it. Fight it militarily, diplomatically, legally, intellectually and
religiously. Fight it in Afghanistan, in Saudi Arabia, in the United
States--in fact, everywhere.</TE>
<TE>   Moderate Muslims will be key allies in this fight. Yes, they are
weak and intimidated these days, but they are crucial if the Muslim
world is to leave its current bout of radicalism.</TE>
<TE>   Once the U.S. government helps them, they can emerge as a
formidable force. (By analogy, remember how the Northern Alliance
seemed hapless just a few months ago? Now it is running Afghanistan.)</TE>
<TE>   Only by focusing on militant Islam can Americans both protect
themselves from their most determined enemy and eventually defeat it.</TE>

<LD>The wells ran dry and the sheep died. Dust storms obliterated the
sun. Afghanistan's worst drought in 30 years threatened to become
wide-scale famine and kill hundreds of thousands, perhaps millions,
who somehow had been spared by the civil war that raged for two
decades. Then came Sept. 11, and the world was forced to remember
Afghanistan.</LD>
<LD>   In the American-led campaign against the Al Qaeda terrorists and
their Taliban protectors, most planes dropped bombs but some dropped
food packets. The provisions kicked out of the belly of a cargo plane
did not help great numbers of people, but the airdrops were an
important symbol of the knowledge that military measures had to be
supplemented by humanitarian assistance.</LD>
<LD>   With the Taliban on the run, donor nations previously hesitant
about aiding a repressive regime opened up their checkbooks to relief
organizations. The result was good news from Afghanistan: A widely
expected famine has been averted.</LD>
<TE>   Last week State Department officials said more than 200,000 tons
of food had been trucked into Afghanistan since September. The U.N.
World Food Program said it brought in record amounts of food in the
final months of last year, using 200 to 300 trucks each day to cross
Afghanistan's borders with Pakistan, Iran and other countries. The
agency delivered the food to distribution points, and an assortment
of relief agencies relayed it onward, using everything from trucks to
donkeys.</TE>
<TE>   Private armies that still plague Afghanistan have stolen some
food, and there are areas too dangerous or remote for relief agencies
to reach. But this is a glass well over half full. The United States,
the largest supplier of food to Afghanistan for years before Sept. 11
and the provider of well over half the aid since then, deserves
credit for demonstrating its intention of destroying Al Qaeda but
helping the Afghan people. The do-good instincts of the American
people come from more than warm hearts. As the enormous Marshall Plan
that rebuilt Europe after World War II proved, economic security
creates political stability. The next task is to help Afghanistan
recover from drought and replant crops, so the nation soon can feed
itself.</TE>

<LD>Almost without notice, gambling is becoming a huge and minimally
regulated business in California. Indian casino building and
expansion account for most of the increase, but a new law that eases
betting on horse races adds to the total. If gambling interests get
their way, there could be an initiative on the November ballot
allowing just about anyone to open a casino. State politicians, whose
campaign coffers are heavily fed by gambling businesses, need to
develop the gumption to demand a slowdown. Unfortunately, since the
tribal compacts will be subject to renegotiation in early 2003, the
tribes will contribute millions to this year's election campaigns.</LD>
<LD>   The number of slot machines whirring and clinking in the 46
casinos operated by California Indian tribes has soared from fewer
than 19,000 two years ago to at least 40,883 now, a rate of increase
indicating that the reach of Nevada-style gambling will be broader
than Gov. Gray Davis estimated when he signed the original gambling
compacts with 61 tribes.</LD>
<TE>   One of the problems with Indian gambling in California is lack of
information. How many customers are visiting the mostly rural
casinos, how much are they gambling, how much are they winning and
losing? The tribes have consented to minimal state regulation, such
as licensing of casino employees, but generally decline to release
financial information. They argue that tribal sovereignty limits what
they have to divulge. But secrecy can hide potential consumer
rip-offs and poor management.</TE>
<TE>   Several attempts are underway to establish tribal casinos in urban
areas despite Davis' declared opposition. California voters in 2000
overwhelmingly gave the state's tribes authority to operate casinos.
Most voters, however, believed that the casinos would be restricted
to existing tribal lands. They did not envision the complicated land
swaps that are putting casinos ever closer to city limits.</TE>
<TE>   If all that isn't enough gambling expansion, there's a new law
that allows horse race fans to place bets from their homes, by
telephone or Internet, on races both in California and elsewhere.
Everyone can be a bookie! The bill was pushed by California race
tracks and signed into law by Davis.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, an organization called the DeVille Group says it is
conducting a $2-million petition drive to put an initiative on the
statewide ballot to allow full-on Nevada-style casinos anywhere in
California. The group, which lists a Palm Springs address, is headed
by a former politician from Maine and a spokesman in Palm Springs.
Not much disclosure is required at the start of the ballot petition
process, but the proposal's backers clearly want more casinos with
less regulation in California cities. Californians who don't favor
nearly unlimited casino gambling across the state should refuse to
sign the petition. Some issues don't deserve to make it to a vote.</TE>
<TE>   Gambling has become very big business in California and threatens
to become much bigger. Davis and the Legislature should tell us where
they plan to draw the line.</TE>

<LD>It doesn't take a high school education to see that political
gamesmanship is dragging out what was supposed to be a hurried effort
to make flying safer, while the modest improvements that have been
made become riddled with worrisome loopholes.</LD>
<LD>   The most fundamental safeguard has been the Aviation Security Act
of 2001, one part of which makes airport screeners federal employees.
The measure significantly raised the bar for those hoping to fill the
new position, which is supposed to offer a career path, rather than
just a paycheck. The new screeners, for instance, must be U.S.
citizens, receive 60 hours of on-the-job training and 40 hours of
classroom instruction. But the Department of Transportation, intent
on retaining many of the current screeners, has pressured Congress to
substitute a year of work experience for the high school diploma that
would have been required.</LD>
<LD>   The public shouldn't let that happen. In demanding a shakeup of
airport security, Americans envisioned a new breed of screener who
would be a cut above the current, minimum-wage worker, someone able
to detect false passports, ask tough questions diplomatically and
make discerning judgments about which passengers should be taken
aside for closer scrutiny. Those on this first and most important
line of defense against terrorists will also need to be adept with
computers and high-tech detection equipment.</LD>
<TE>   But even crackerjack screeners will be like cops in Yugos chasing
crooks in Corvettes until airport screening gear is updated. Here,
Transportation Department head Norman Y. Mineta is reportedly moving
as quickly as possible to buy and install machines, including ones
that use jets of air to pick up molecules from skin and clothing and
then chemically test them for traces of explosives. But most
equipment at the moment is unable to detect plastic explosives of the
kind that Richard C. Reid allegedly inserted into his shoes.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the Transportation Department is almost certain not to
meet the Jan. 18 deadline the Aviation Security Act set for examining
all checked luggage for explosives. Some of the government's excuses
for its pokiness are understandable. Fighting terrorism is new to the
United States. Some steps taken early on--such as flooding airports
with National Guardsmen--need to be reconsidered.</TE>
<TE>   One obvious move to get things rolling would be to have someone in
charge of the new Transportation Security Administration. Yet it
appears that the confirmation of John Magaw, President Bush's nominee
to run the agency, has hit a strange snag.</TE>
<TE>   Magaw is eminently qualified for the position, having previously
headed the Secret Service and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and
Firearms. But Senate Republicans say that one of their colleagues has
placed a secret hold on his nomination. Why? Some hint it is because
Magaw once defended some of the ATF's actions during the infamous
1992 shootout at Ruby Ridge--a favorite obsession of some fringe
types.</TE>
<TE>   Holding public safety hostage to petty politics is reckless.
Americans will have many other words for such behavior if, as a
result of stalled airport security, someone with explosive sneakers
blows a passenger jet out of the sky.</TE>

before the new billboard restrictions took place on New Year's Day.
How would anyone on the MTA board recognize a bad-faith practice? The
board consistently ignores public opinion and uses any means
necessary to fund pet projects.</TE>

<LD>As an Iraqi American, I read with interest Shibley Telhami's "A Time
to Value Our World of Worry." Though I have found his to be a voice
of reason in the past, I started wondering when I read his Jan. 2
commentary.</LD>
<LD>   Telhami advises us against action to effect a regime change in
Baghdad, partly because he is concerned about the sanctity of our
nation's principles. Presumably, attacking Iraq is against our
nation's principles.</LD>
<LD>   But he forgets that our current policy of dual containment and
enforcing U.N. sanctions, which must be continued in the absence of a
regime change in Baghdad, is even more reprehensible and immoral,
considering that the starving and malnourished Iraqi babies are
paying the price of Saddam Hussein's intransigence and insistence on
building and accumulating the weapons of mass destruction that
Telhami fears Saddam will use when attacked.</LD>
<TE>   Which world does Telhami want his children to live in--a world
where the U.S. stands for spreading democracy or a world where the
U.S. is blamed for the death and starvation of the children of Iraq?
My preference is for the former; Telhami would have us choose the
latter.</TE>

<TE>   Re "Iraqi People Deserve to Be Liberated," Opinion, Dec. 30: I
just love the arrogance of people like Geraldine Brooks, who so
casually would send my sons and daughters into harm's way on a
mission to save Iraqis from their own government. And to save them
for what, domination by the U.S. government, the same government that
ignores its own Constitution and has just repealed most of the
remainder of the Bill of Rights?</TE>
<TE>   It always amazes me how Americans think it was the U.S. government
that made this country wealthy rather than the wisdom of the
founders, who created the smallest government they could agree upon.
What economic ignorance! It takes decades for a society to learn how
to progress with a free market. If Iraq is freed, it will no better
know what to do with that freedom than the Russians knew what to do
with theirs.</TE>
<TE>   It is as though Iraqis are not responsible for their own freedom.
What is next, the other dozens of countries that have worse
governments? Or is Iraq only worth saving because it sits on all that
oil?</TE>

the world in the image of the Constitution-less U.S.</TE>

<LD>My wife, 3-year-old daughter and I were first-time visitors to L.A.
between Christmas and New Year's Day, specifically Hollywood and a
one-day jaunt to Disneyland. Travel guides love to scare people about
how complicated L.A. is, and how you'd better have a car or you're
sunk. They call Hollywood Boulevard seedy and public transportation
limited. I realize we didn't see much in just a few days, but what I
saw and experienced was neither seedy nor limited, and not any more
complicated than any other city.</LD>
<LD>   For only $1.35 per person we had a speedy ride from Union Station
to Hollywood Boulevard and Highland Avenue in clean, comfortable
cars. Within minutes we were at the Roosevelt Hotel. The famed
boulevard exceeded our expectations, especially the new Hollywood &amp;
Highland shopping area. The myth of a city of dreams stood the
test--and is still very real in our minds. Thanks for the good time,
Los Angeles.</LD>

<LD>Call me a cynic, but if America has changed so much since Sept. 11,
then why do grocery store parking lots remain cluttered with
abandoned shopping carts? Why do telemarketers continue to call at
dinner time? And why do second-rate singers at sporting events still
insist on rewriting the words and music to the national anthem?</LD>

<LD>Re "Battling Islamic 'Puritans,' " Jan. 2: I am part of a vast
majority of U.S. Muslims appalled beyond words by 9/11 and the
hijacking of our faith by technologically adept, theological
barbarians and one-eyed, illiterate mullahs. UCLA law professor
Khaled Abou El Fadl's scholarship challenges the drivel perpetuated
in the name of religion. He also represents some of the best
attributes of Islam: a patient rescuing of fact from dogma through
serious, honest scholarship; an acceptance and celebration of the
great diversity of creation, both human and animal; and above all an
attitude that posits kindness and generosity of spirit toward others,
not blind hatred and animosity.</LD>
<LD>   To paraphrase the late Gilbert Murray of Columbia, professor Abou
El Fadl walks gently in a world where the lights are dim and the very
stars wonder.</LD>

<TE>   Thanks to Teresa Watanabe for the fine article on Abou El Fadl.
His efforts in battling the forces of shame, guilt and repression in
Islam deserve our hearty congratulations and support.</TE>
<TE>   We don't have to be reminded that puritanism also plagues
Christianity. It is a major source of violence and crime in our own
society. Many church people fail to heed the teachings of thinkers
from Plato and Jesus to Walt Whitman that the erotic impulse is the
foundation of our sociability and democratic freedoms (not guns!). If
there is anything that science has taught us it is that aggression
and intolerance can always be traced back to the denial of physical
affection.</TE>
<TE>   Abou El Fadl's work and Watanabe's article go a long way in
helping all of us accept the central importance of love.</TE>

<TE>   If it weren't so sad, I'd laugh. Here's a smart, hard-working,
very well-educated guy, Abou El Fadl, and he's spending his life
convincing some superstitious people that black dogs aren't evil,
women aren't impure and it's not good to be a murderous fanatic. And
here's the funny part. He isn't doing it by observation, experiment,
reason or logic. He's doing it by finding little passages written
1,400 years ago by some guy who knew less about the world than the
average sixth-grader.</TE>

<LD>In listing the arbitration awards against Kaiser emergency room
services between 1995 and 2001, your report in every case names the
HMO as being responsible ("Cases Reveal Lapses in Kaiser Emergency
Care," Jan. 2). Going through the brief description of all nine cases
listed, it is clear that every case represents a medical malpractice
on the part of the emergency room physician or personnel. Even the
patients' attorneys do not claim the existence of systemic problems
with the care.</LD>
<LD>   Short of reviewing the medical malpractice cases of a comparable
number of emergency room services not operated by Kaiser, it is not
possible to draw any conclusion regarding lapses in care at this HMO.</LD>
<LD>   The emergency room in any setting is a high-pressure environment
and the personnel working there occasionally make mistakes that can
have tragic consequences.</LD>

<TE>   Re "Repair, Don't Merely Bandage, Health Care," Commentary, Dec.
28: Few people realize that in California, hospitals and doctors are
struggling to survive. I'm not only talking about trauma centers and
emergency rooms. Your community hospital and local doctor or surgeon
could soon face extinction.</TE>
<TE>   Yes, many hospitals are building and expanding. It's not that they
are doing financially well. Most of it is because of government
mandates and new earthquake codes forcing the hospitals to conform or
face closure.</TE>
<TE>   As more money is channeled into cement walls, less and less money
exists to replace aging machines and equipment and invest in new
technology helpful to the public.</TE>
<TE>   And, of course, hardly any money goes to improve the quality of
care, such as hiring more nurses, therapists and aides in order to
have better staffing, which is now dismally dangerous. An occasional
minor pay raise is given to the nurses chiefly to silence them about
some critical staffing issues and in the hope that they won't go
elsewhere.</TE>
<TE>   All doctors, but especially surgeons, have been price-fixed by
managed care, Medicare, Blue Cross, etc., into accepting intolerably
low reimbursements for services rendered. Another 5.5% cut in
reimbursements takes place this month. New doctors are taking up
residence in other states and some of the finest surgeons and doctors
have moved or retired because they cannot afford to keep their
offices open.</TE>
<TE>   When you get sick today, tomorrow or in five years, it will be too
late to say: How and when did this happen? Why are there so few good
doctors and hospitals around? Why do I have to go across the city for
that test? Or to another state for my operation?</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>I'm still scratching my head after reading Alexander Cockburn's Dec.
28 commentary, "An Enron Tale of Strange Bedfellows." The Natural
Resources Defense Council was part of a coalition of environmental
and consumer groups that negotiated an agreement with merging
companies Enron and Portland General Electric on future investment in
energy efficiency, renewable energy, watershed restoration and
low-income energy services. Cockburn is indignant that I said I
trusted Enron to execute the agreement. Enron and PGE did indeed meet
their merger obligations. Enron left in place a hometown management
group with a commitment to improved performance on both environmental
and equity issues. Enron's subsequent decision to leave the utility
business, long before its collapse, had no adverse environmental
consequences.</LD>
<LD>   There is no connection between Enron's current calamity and the
merger that the NRDC and many others supported conditionally nearly
five years ago. Only Cockburn's overactive imagination could suggest
otherwise.</LD>

<HD>Mommy, Me and an Advanced Degree</HD>
<DH>The pull of stay-at-home motherhood seems to be
intensifying for some career women.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ANN MARSH</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>On a recent evening at Lilly's French Cafe on Abbot Kinney Boulevard
in Venice, Andrea Stanford, 35, joins four other mothers at an
outside table for a book club dinner. The evening's selection,
"Midwives," is aptly titled, for the women are in the process of
birthing new lives not only for their young children, but also for
themselves.</LD>
<LD>   You might say that Stanford and her book club friends are
thoroughbreds of the U.S. economy. Each invested prodigious amounts
of time and money to acquire an advanced degree in business or law
from a top university. Each built an impressive work resume.</LD>
<LD>   And, then, after bearing a child in her 30s, all but one in recent
years decided to lay aside the prestige, adventure and income of her
professional life to raise a family from home. The one working mother
in the group has a part-time job. In Stanford's case, this meant
reducing the number of household income streams from two to one, just
after buying a house. She isn't alone in taking this course. At
Stanford's other book club, seven of the eight members--all women
with advanced degrees--are stay-at-home moth- ers who are postponing
their career goals. Says Stanford, "We feel like we're doing
something really important. I don't think there's a lot of regret. We
all see this as our second career."</LD>
<TE>   A similar phenomenon is at work on the other side of the country
in Cambridge, Mass., among a slightly younger group of women in their
late 20s to early 30s. In the second-year class of MBA candidates now
at Harvard Business School, it appears that two to three times as
many students as usual are pregnant. The increase is anecdotal; the
university doesn't keep track of whether its female students are
expecting. But students say a typical class will have one or two
pregnant students. This year, there are at least five pregnancies or
births, and a rumored sixth, among the 200-plus female students.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, other women in the class say they hope to follow
suit, opting out of the rush to interview with a dwindling number of
recruiters on campus in this economic downturn. Says one woman who is
trying to get pregnant, "I'm amazed by the number of pregnant bellies
I see in class."</TE>
<TE>   Is something afoot? Perhaps. A combination of forces, from the
lagging economy to a shrinking number of flexible job positions to
the psychological fallout from the World Trade Center disaster, is
pushing some of the country's best-prepared career women toward
stay-at-home motherhood. And that could magnify a trend detected by
the U.S. Census Bureau and detailed in its "Fertility of American
Women" report, released in October.</TE>
<TE>   The report surveyed 30,000 women and found that between June 1998
and June 2000, the percentage of women in the workplace with infant
children declined from 59% to 55%. It was the first such drop since
the periodic survey began in 1976.</TE>
<TE>   Vicky Lovell, a study director at the Institute for Women's Policy
Research in Washington, D.C., speculates that the drop may simply
reflect the exit from the work force of a well-off group of women who
joined it between 1994 and 1998, the time of the last Census Bureau
report.</TE>
<TE>   "We saw sort of a bubble," Lovell says. "My interpretation of it
was that this was a group of women who were unusually privileged and
who entered the labor force at a vigorous time in the economy. The
opportunities may have been too good for them to give up."</TE>
<TE>   Even at the peak of the boom, however, in the 1998 to 2000 period,
many of more than two dozen women interviewed say they began trading
economic opportunity for time at home with the children. In some
cases, they did so because their husbands were making enough to
offset the loss of their salaries. And many found the dot-com ethos
of long hours and endless work weeks incompatible with effective
child-rearing, no matter how tempting the financial reward.</TE>
<TE>   Once the downturn started, in spring 2000, layoffs began and job
opportunities dwindled. Some decided the time had come to make a
change they'd been contemplating for months or even years. "From an
economist's point of view, it's very rational," Lovell says. "They're
guessing the recession will not last very long and thinking that the
salary they're giving up now is probably less than what they will get
later."</TE>
<TE>   It is unclear whether this decline will continue as the economic
doldrums force more fiscal austerity on U.S. families. "We won't know
for a while where the trend will settle down," Lovell says. But for
some with the means to opt out of the work force, the new realities
of recession-era workplaces and a shift in the national mentality
have put a brighter gloss on motherhood.</TE>
<TE>   Back when the nation's crop of 2002 business school graduates sent
in their applications for MBA programs, job opportunities were
plentiful, with employers dangling enticements ranging from huge
signing bonuses to plum assignments for recent grads.</TE>
<TE>   If the job market were still strong, Belen Aranda-Alvarado, a
member of the Harvard Business School class of 2002, suspects it
would be difficult to embrace the prospect of motherhood. "I would be
feeling, 'Oh, I've got to get out there,'" she says. "I would have
considered a big media company career in New York, and we [she and
her longtime boyfriend] would have been in a long-distance
relationship."</TE>
<TE>   Instead, Aranda-Alvarado, 28, plans to marry soon. She gave birth
Dec. 14 to a daughter. Two days later, she finished her final exams.
The pregnancy was welcome but unplanned.</TE>
<TE>   "Probably when we entered business school, [pregnancy] wasn't what
any of us were thinking," Aranda-Alvarado said of herself and her
classmates. "It certainly wasn't what I was thinking." But the
recession, combined with the horror of watching so many working
professionals perish in the terrorist attacks on the World Trade
Center, has shifted Aranda-Alvarado's priorities.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't need to get onto this treadmill that everyone is on right
away," she says. She suspects she will put her MBA to use from home,
starting an entrepreneurial venture while staying close to her baby.
In the competitive breeding ground of some of the nation's top
business students at Harvard, her choice is being met with broad
support from her peers.</TE>
<TE>   "I was surprised at how many men said, 'Take a year off. That is
what I would do,'" Aranda-Alvarado says. "They kind of see me as
having the perfect solution [to the recession] that is socially
acceptable."</TE>
<TE>   She believes that for now, the balance of power has shifted from
employee to employer, and "it's going to get nastier before it gets
any better." But stepping away from the workplace may simply mean
trading one set of stressors for another.</TE>
<TE>   Mothers and mothers-to-be find themselves in a particularly
existential juncture, says Joanne Brundage, founder of Mothers and
More, www.mothersandmore.org, an Elmhurst, Ill.-based national
support network for women who alter their career paths to care for
their children. Shifting from the workplace to the home in the best
of times tends to precipitate an "unintentional midlife crisis." But
in the aftermath of Sept. 11 and smack in the middle of an economic
downturn, the tensions are acute. "It's a fascinating combination of
events societally," Brundage says. "On the one side, women are
feeling financially vulnerable. On the other side they're feeling
their values shift."</TE>
<TE>   Jennie Wong, 35, the director of development for the Southern
California office of the Arthritis Foundation, gave birth in
September and decided last month that it just isn't worth it to work
even part time if it means missing her son's rapid growth. Once a
week she attends a "Mommy and Me" class with as many as 30 other new
mothers. She estimates that about half are stepping out of the work
force. She doesn't envy those compelled to balance work pressure with
infant care. Among those who are returning, she says, "there is a lot
of anxiety and a lot of depression."</TE>
<TE>   Long Beach-based interior designer Lisa Kells, 33, whose son was
born in October, confesses to wishing she could easily choose to stay
at home.</TE>
<TE>   "The recession does not make this easier. I feel I need this job
to bring home the bacon," Kells says. But, she adds, "I want to be a
mom and stay at home. I feel guilt about going back." A longtime
weekly airplane traveler for work, Kells recently discovered she
feels less inclined to leave home. "I was like, 'Why am I feeling
weird about going to the airport?' All of a sudden you have another
set of values."</TE>
<TE>   Amy Shohet, who lives in Los Gatos, feels much the same way.
Shohet quit her job in October. And she pulled her baby out of infant
day-care, joining a large number of Bay Area women who did so after
the recession set in last year, which wiped out long waiting lists at
the once-crowded centers.</TE>
<TE>   Shohet had spent years working toward a master's degree in social
work and had risen to a management position at a nonprofit catering
to the needs of emotionally disturbed children. She wore a pager 24
hours a day and oversaw a staff of 15. "I worked very hard to get
where I was," Shohet said.</TE>
<TE>   So it was with mixed feelings that she made the choice to stay
home. But the long hours and cost of child care made it difficult to
keep her modest-paying position. The recession hastened her decision
to quit. Given the current job climate, she and her husband are
afraid to do anything to jeopardize the good standing Shohet's
husband enjoys at his job. If Shohet worked, he would need to leave
the office more regularly to handle child care. "We didn't want to
take any kind of chance with him asking for any time off," says
Shohet. And she's not alone. "A lot of women I know who are pregnant
say, 'I wish I were getting laid off'" to make the decision to stay
home easier, she says.  But making such a choice can be costly, says
Ann Crittenden, author of the book "The Price of Motherhood." Even
women with supportive husbands are putting themselves at enormous
financial risk by opting out of the workplace, she says. They won't
be building up savings toward retirement. Should they divorce, courts
traditionally do not reward substantial child support to women with
advanced degrees, assuming they can easily find work, she says. At
the same time, Crittenden says, she's happy to see women asserting
their values with their children.</TE>
<TE>   "Those who can afford it are voting with their feet because given
the workaholic climate in most workplaces, it's the only way they can
spend any time with their babies," she says. "They're between a rock
and a hard place."</TE>
<TE>   Margot Rabinowitz Eiran, 30, is feeling the pinch. The second-year
MBA candidate at Harvard says the recession and the World Trade
Center attacks firmly convinced her to put family first. Eiran has
yet to become pregnant, but she and her husband recently decided they
would start a family sooner rather than later, even if their
circumstances aren't perfect.</TE>
<TE>   The Sept. 11 attacks "gave us the immediate feeling that we should
live our lives to the fullest," says Eiran, who was a highly paid
consultant before business school. "My ideal was to have kids when we
have more of a financial base. But I've lowered my ideal. Now I don't
feel like staying in one of those high-pressure jobs, even though I
do have bank loans hanging over my head."</TE>
<TE>   Eiran wants to stay home with her child. But her husband recently
started his first year of a doctoral program and probably won't make
enough money in the short term to support a family. Eiran knows she
may have to work.</TE>
<TE>   Even so, she finds that some classmates are urging her to have a
child. "They say, 'Why don't you go ahead and do it?' Maybe this
external situation has changed people's attitudes," Eiran speculates.
She has decided she is ready to make financial and professional
sacrifices to become a mother. "I am looking at how people raise kids
in low-income situations. They do get by. They manage."</TE>

<LD>"The Magic Fish"by Freya Littledale</LD>
<LD>   Once upon a time there was a magic fish, a fisherman and his wife.
The fish lived in the sea, and the fisherman and his wife lived in a
little hut. The fisherman's wife did not like the little hut and told
the fisherman to go tell the magic fish she wanted a castle. So, the
fisherman went and told the fish his wife wanted a castle, and the
fish told him to go home because the wife now had a castle. So the
fisherman went home, and he saw a castle.</LD>
<LD>   Then the fisherman's wife decided she wanted more than a castle.
She wanted to be a queen. So the fisherman went to the magic fish and
told the fish that his wife wants more than a castle; she wanted to
be a queen.</LD>
<TE>   Read the book to find out what the magic fish does.</TE>

<HD>Putting Their House in Order</HD>
<DH>Preservationists are debating how to restore Madison's
Montpelier, which features 20th century additions.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PETER WHORISKEY</AU>
<BD>WASHINGTON POST</BD>
<DL>ORANGE, Va.</DL>
<LD>Thousands flock to the home of James Madison every season hoping to
envision the scenes of his life: his Virginia youth, the
constitutional studies undertaken in the upstairs library, the
drawing-room conversations animated by the likes of Thomas Jefferson
and Daniel Webster.</LD>
<LD>   What they experience is a clash of centuries.</LD>
<LD>   The original Madison house has been wrapped by additions put up
roughly a century later by heirs of the Du Pont industrial fortune
who purchased the site in 1901 and more than doubled the house's
size. The historical gap is revealed on the main floor: Three rooms
are furnished to represent the Du Ponts' time, and four rooms
represent the Madisons' era.</LD>
<TE>   Now, as a new and exhaustive architectural investigation gets
underway to outline the original layout of Madison's home, the
guardians of Montpelier face a monumental decision about whether the
national landmark should be restored to its Madisonian origins
through the obliteration of the vast Du Pont work.</TE>
<TE>   The prospect of a massive demolition at the 55-room Montpelier
estate has been the subject of passionate, on-and-off debate since
the Du Pont family bequeathed the property to the National Trust for
Historic Preservation in 1984.</TE>
<TE>   "You can't create the aura of the James Madison house with the Du
Pont wings stuck on," said Ralph Ketcham, a Syracuse University
professor emeritus and Madison biographer.</TE>
<TE>   Many historians and guests think the property should be arranged
solely to present what they consider to be its most important story:
the life of the "Father of the Constitution" and the nation's fourth
president. In their view, the $750,000 investigation now underway,
which includes an examination of everything from paint chips to wood
framing, will allow an accurate restoration, and the Du Pont
alterations should not be allowed to interfere with a visitor's
experience.</TE>
<TE>   "There is no federal monument to James Madison, and he is not on
the currency, so if you want to honor him, this is it," said Michael
Quinn, president of the Montpelier Foundation, which manages the
property and is adopting a neutral stance. "The purpose of this
investigation is to make a defensible, well-reasoned decision."</TE>
<TE>   Opposition to the demolition is likely to come from two
influential camps.</TE>
<TE>   Henry du Pont, grandson of William du Pont, the family member who
purchased and enlarged the house, stipulated before transfer of the
property to the National Trust that two large Du Pont-era rooms on
the main floor be preserved as a memorial to his grandfather and
furnished in the Edwardian style favored during his grandfather's
time.</TE>
<TE>   The National Trust is legally obliged to consider the views of
Henry du Pont and his wife, Martha, about any preservation and
restoration efforts. "It's unrealistic to think that you can restore
it to the little house it was," Martha du Pont said. "What we want to
make sure of is that William du Pont is not forgotten. He cared
enough to buy a broken-down house and save it."</TE>
<TE>   She expressed anger at the National Trust, which she said had
"stolen" the property from the family by having her husband's elderly
aunt sign papers. But, she said: "I don't think the family would give
them a great big fight if they want to give it more of a Madison
feel."</TE>
<TE>   Second, regardless of the stance that Henry and Martha du Pont
take on demolition, some preservationists argue that any major
alteration to the property to re-create Madison's house would amount
to a betrayal of historical truth and risks destroying elements that
could be valuable in the future.</TE>
<TE>   "What is there at Montpelier today is enormously important--it is
what really happened," said W. Brown Morton, professor of historic
preservation at Mary Washington College in Fredericksburg, Va., and
co-author of the federal preservation guidelines, "Standards for
Historic Preservation Projects."</TE>
<TE>   Morton said recently: "When you start manipulating what is there
in a theatrical way, then you end up with what never happened."</TE>
<TE>   Few, however, dispute that Madison's era was the most important in
Montpelier's long history, and the exhibits there have gradually
focused more and more on that era.</TE>
<TE>   Montpelier was Madison's lifelong home and evolved in step with
his family and career. The earliest portion was built by his father
about 1760, when James was a boy of 9; after he married Dolley in
1794, Madison expanded the home and added a classical front portico.
Another expansion occurred between 1809 and 1812.</TE>
<TE>   Biographers depict countless scenes at Montpelier that moved
Madison and, in turn, the course of history.</TE>
<TE>   In the upstairs library, for example, they picture him in 1786
poring over cartons of books sent by Jefferson, studying the failures
of past governments. It was there that he is believed to have written
"Notes on Ancient and Modern Confederacies," a cram session that
would inform his monumental work at the constitutional conventions
and in the Federalist Papers.</TE>
<TE>   "Since I have been at home, I have had the leisure to review the
literary cargo for which I am so much indebted to your friendship,"
he wrote to Jefferson from his estate in March 1786. "If anything
comes of the convention, it will probably be of a permanent, not a
temporary, nature, which I think will be a great point."</TE>
<TE>   The architectural revisions to the Madison property that now
bedevil investigators began after Dolley Madison sold the home in
1844, eight years after her husband's death. The property changed
hands several times before William du Pont purchased it in 1901 and,
in an attempt to create an English country house, began major
renovations to the sides and back of the house.</TE>
<TE>   The last Du Pont to live at Montpelier, Marion du Pont, William's
daughter, directed in her will that the home be turned over to the
National Trust and converted into a Madison shrine. However, her
nephews Henry and John du Pont contested her wishes in court, and the
negotiated settlement in 1984 called for the National Trust to keep
the "memorial" rooms honoring William du Pont.</TE>
<TE>   For now, the question of whether Montpelier should be returned to
its Madisonian origins turns on two largely subjective questions: How
much evidence is needed to ensure that the restoration is authentic?
And even if it can be done authentically, should it be done?</TE>
<TE>   Cost estimates in the past have reached $40 million.</TE>
<TE>   Representatives of the National Trust and the Montpelier
Foundation, the private nonprofit group that manages the property,
declined to speculate about Montpelier's future.</TE>
<TE>   "There is a feeling that we would be better served if the house
were more in the configuration that was there when Madison was
there," said William Lewis, a Washington lawyer who is chairman of
the Montpelier Foundation. "But we won't have any final answers until
after the investigation is done."</TE>

<HD>All That's Holy, and Then Some</HD>
<DH>East L.A.'s eclectic Nativity scenes proudly connote
Mexican heritage as well as the birth of Christ.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARY ROURKE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When fantasies are not just allowed but expected, residents of East
Los Angeles rise to the occasion. In a few frontyards this Christmas
season--which includes today's Feast of the Epiphany, celebrating the
gifts of the three kings to the baby Jesus--Nativity scenes go beyond
statues of Mary, Joseph and the Christ child. In these imaginative
creations, the holy family looks out from Bethlehem onto tropical
jungles and snowy Victorian towns, dinosaur parks and roadside taco
stands. Everything fits together in one vast diorama that takes the
original Christmas story to unexpected places.</LD>
<LD>   Private daydreams mix with family history in these narratives,
which more often than not cover most of a front lawn. Santa and his
reindeer fly overhead beside pink wedding bells from a Las Vegas
chapel. Children's rubber turtles crawl beside a tin-foil waterfall.
Perfume bottles balance near the baby Jesus' crib. After all, a
nacimiento, a Latino Nativity scene, has traditions of its own to
live up to.</LD>
<LD>   "Every nacimiento has a family story behind it," says James Rojas,
42, a city planner with the Metropolitan Transit Authority of Los
Angeles. Rojas organized a tour being conducted today of nacimientos.
It is sponsored by the Latino Urban Forum, a loose association of
architects and city planners that looks for ways to preserve and
enhance Latino communities.</LD>
<TE>   "If we are going to improve our communities, we need to understand
how they work," says Rojas, a compact man with a Pancho Villa
mustache. "The tour is a way to highlight nacimientos and make people
aware of them. We need to understand they are important to some
people." He compares the sprawling sculptural dramas to neighborhood
murals and local monuments. "All of them are public expressions that
reflect something of the owners," he says.</TE>
<TE>   In the heavily Mexican American neighborhoods of East L.A.--on
Clarence Street, Mott Street and others--an essential ingredient of
any nacimiento is a scene from rural Mexico. Ponies run free in a
corral, pigs loll in the mud, a woman in a bright serape carries
water among the shadows of a manger scene.</TE>
<TE>   Each of these homemade creations is distinctively original, but
all of them are made with simple ingredients. A baby doll for Jesus,
a mirror for a lake to suggest the long journey to Bethlehem, plaster
figures from more typical manger scenes to represent the saints are
all crowded into a vision that defies the laws of scale and
perspective.</TE>
<TE>   Beneath it, a landscape made from hard-packed dirt covers a
kitchen table top, or sometimes a set of stairs is carpeted in green
plastic turf. It can take an entire family days or even weeks to put
it all together. Ideally the scene is in place by Dec. 12, the feast
of Our Lady of Guadalupe and the start of the Christmas season in
Mexico.</TE>
<TE>   Most of these reverent dioramas are passed down through families,
from generation to generation, and the majority of them are displayed
indoors for their protection. As a boy growing up in Boyle Heights,
Rojas helped his grandmother install hers in the living room each
year. But to him, the frontyard displays are much more daring.
"You're making a public statement about who you are," he says.</TE>
<TE>   Folklorist Mary MacGregor Villarreal has studied Los Angeles'
nacimientos for 30 years.</TE>
<TE>   "Put the scene outside, and it is a badge of Mexican identity,"
she says. Usually, it's a woman in the family who preserves the
nacimiento pieces in her house from year to year, just as her mother
did before her. A younger member of the family is asked to be the
godmother, whose responsibility it is to make clothing for the statue
of the infant and dress the figure for the visit of the three kings.</TE>
<TE>   Legend holds that Nativity scenes were first introduced in Italy
in 1223 by St. Francis of Assisi, who asked a man to build a manger
so that he could say Mass in front of it. By the 18th century,
workshops across Europe and Latin America specialized in producing
Nativity sculptures. Families collected the basic pieces but added
other scenes from their own home towns. "It heightened the realism to
include modern taverns and markets," says Johanna Hecht, a curator of
European sculpture at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York. "It
was an effort to engage the audience and to say, 'You are present at
the birth.'" The Met's famous Nativity scene, displayed around the
annual Christmas tree in the museum's sculpture galleries, is from
Naples, Italy, and once belonged to private collectors. Some 50
ceramic angels fill out the scene. "There was rivalry to see which
family could outdo the others," Hecht says. "A Nativity scene could
extend through several rooms of the house and onto the rooftop."</TE>
<TE>   The same competition does not seem to exist among the neighbors on
Rojas' tour. Olivia Segura, 54, of Ditman Street puts up her
nacimiento every year for her own sake. This year the five
grandchildren she baby-sits watched her work from their strollers and
tricycles. "I do this because I promised my dear Lord," she says. At
16, she nearly died of an illness. "I said, if I live I will make a
nacimiento every year," she says. That was 38 years ago. Twinkling
Christmas tree lights and silver snowflakes light the tarp covering
her diorama, set on a table top. "I'll do this until the last minute
of my life."</TE>
<TE>   Carlos Aguilar and his wife have put up their nacimiento for all
of their 38 years of marriage. This year their frontyard on Clarence
Street is completely overtaken. "The men of the family build the
structure, the women decorate. It's a tradition for us to show our
culture. I have more room in my backyard, but no one would see it
back there."</TE>
<TE>   Many visitors are drawn to the scenes for the popular theology
they contain. Christ came from heaven for kings and ranchers, saints
and revelers, the nacimientos of East Los Angeles assure viewers.
Rojas, however, looks at the arrangements for clues about how Mexican
Americans use their outdoor space.</TE>
<TE>   "Your frontyard is a place for personal expression," he says. "If
you decorate the inside of your house for holidays, you'll decorate
the outside." And if you build a Nativity scene at Christmas, he
says, you are likely to set up an altar for the Day of the Dead on
Nov. 2, the Mexican feast honoring the souls of ancestors. "It's a
matter of national pride," he says.</TE>
<TE>   Gregorio Luke, director of the Museum of Latin American Art in
Long Beach, has displayed rare nacimientos in his museum and studied
their history. They fit the Mexican style of expressing the faith.</TE>
<TE>   "We Mexicans reenact things," he says. Christmas processions,
Easter pageants, the building of home altars and Nativity scenes are
ways to participate, he says. Many second-generation Mexican
Americans leave these traditions behind and replace them with a small
Nativity scene, tucked under the Christmas tree. This year in
particular, Luke believes, the more emphatic way of recalling the
Christmas story takes on greater meaning.</TE>
<TE>   "Jesus came and taught us that a man should not respond to
violence with violence," he says. "It's important to recapture that
lesson now, no matter our religion. Either that or we'll all be dead.</TE>

<HD>Last Year's Wound That Will Never Heal</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Forgive Nikki Stern if she didn't feel much like celebrating this
year.</LD>
<LD>   While the rest of us have embraced this new year as a chance to
put the pain and horror of 2001 behind us, Stern and her
friends--"the widows," she calls them--worry that the dawn of 2002
will reduce their plight to last year's news.</LD>
<LD>   "People like to move on in this country," said Stern, whose
husband was one of the 3,000 who died in the World Trade Center
attacks. "We want things fixed, healed, hidden from view."</LD>
<TE>   But she, and thousands like her, are shackled by grief to a year
that holds one of our nation's most painful memories. Stern spent the
holidays with family in Southern California, away from her home in
Princeton, N.J., and its physical reminders of her loss.</TE>
<TE>   But here, she confronted a different kind of pain, as she realized
that the grief that continues to rub the East Coast raw is but an
abstract in much of the nation.</TE>
<TE>   So she spent the last weekend of the worst year of her life
fielding calls and e-mails from New Jersey widows who talked of
"quitting, giving up" while listening to callers to talk radio shows
rail about the ingratitude of greedy survivors, unhappy with
government settlements said to average more than a million dollars.</TE>
<TE>   "We were all vilified as greedy, petty complainers," said Stern,
bewildered that a sympathetic public could have turned so brutal.
"Not that I'm taking it personally. I mean, what could possibly hurt
worse than Jim being gone?"</TE>
<TE>   Her husband, Jim Potorti, was at work on the 96th floor of the
World Trade Center when terrorists struck and the buildings
collapsed. He was no high-rolling bond trader or heroic firefighter,
just one of hundreds of anonymous middle-management types, who
vanished in the rubble.</TE>
<TE>   "He didn't live to work, he worked to live," Nikki recalled, and
for the first time in our afternoon together, smiled. She pulled a
pile of photos from her purse--Jim gardening, Jim barbecuing, Jim
holding her in his arms. "Look how handsome he is," she said,
brushing her finger across his face. "What a catch." And I can't tell
if the break in her voice is a chuckle or a sob.</TE>
<TE>   She and Jim were married 11 years. They had no children and were
still as starry-eyed as newlyweds. If he were alive, they would have
rung in the New Year together at home, with a home-cooked meal and a
bottle of wine.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, she traveled alone to Corona del Mar to visit her cousin
Judy Sherkow, who has talked her through many a dark night since
September. She figured to spend New Year's Eve reminiscing with Judy
and her husband about Jim and a trip the foursome had taken to Italy.
Instead, the three of them watched a movie, then Stern retreated to
the computer and the companionship of women from her "grief group"
back home, who felt as alone and desperate as she.</TE>
<TE>   "We're just not ready for the year to end," she said. "We don't
want this to be 'what happened last year'.... That just puts us
further away from the people we lost; the ones we depended on, we
loved."</TE>
<TE>   Nikki Stern flew home Wednesday to her empty house, her grief
group, her job as a consultant at an architecture firm, her 28 manila
folders crammed with the official renderings of her life with Jim:
birth certificate, marriage license, insurance papers, medical
records, credit card bills--documentation she needs as she wends her
way through the maze of agencies and services offering help to
victims.</TE>
<TE>   "People think, 'Gee, they're so lucky. They're getting so much
attention.' But the amount of charity we've received has been
exaggerated incredibly, and the hoops we've had to jump through for
each little thing ... it's pushed some of us close to the edge of
insanity."</TE>
<TE>   She realizes now that the public perception of victims is
shifting, as news spreads that families have been offered government
settlements that, when combined with insurance and other payments,
could leave them with an average of $1.6 million. But Stern said that
the formula used to determine what each family actually receives will
shortchange many and strip them of their right to sue for more. "It
protects the financial interests of the airlines," she said, "not the
families."</TE>
<TE>   And she wishes those who consider them greedy could sit in for one
night with one of the groups of survivors that meets regularly to
offer support. They would see, "the financial problems are the easy
ones to solve. What's tough is the emotional recovery."</TE>
<TE>   Last month, a widow of one of the World Trade Center victims shot
herself to death in the bedroom of the dream home her husband had
just completed. The news of her suicide blew through Stern's group
like a gust of icy wind, she said. "That's all we talk about
sometimes, how close we are" to that edge. "You don't think about
making it through the year, just through the day, another week, the
next month.... "</TE>
<TE>   So this year, her resolutions are mostly wishes: More strength,
less confusion, more courage, less pain. "I imagine things will get
better for me," she said. "It's just awfully hard to see the forest
for the trees, and to listen for reason when there is so much noise.</TE>
<TE>   "How I miss Jim's quiet voice."</TE>

<LD>Yesterday our lady, Terry, told us, "Visitors are coming to the farm
this weekend. They are from the big city. It will be their first time
visiting a farm."</LD>
<LD>   This is a chance for Terry's guests to meet all the horses,
Smokey, our dog, and Howard, our cat, with his five new kittens.</LD>
<LD>   I knew I would draw a lot of attention. Dogs and cats, of course,
are very common animals for city people to see. But I am a colt.</LD>
<TE>   When the guests finally arrived, Terry brought them to the
farmyard to meet us. "Here is our youngest horse, Cinnamon. He is
just 5 months old."</TE>
<TE>   "Hmm. Handsome!" one guest said.</TE>
<TE>   I proudly raised my head high and straightened my slim body.</TE>
<TE>   "Look at his hair. What color is it?" they asked.</TE>
<TE>   "Cinnamon, of course," replied Terry.</TE>
<TE>   Everyone saw different things in me. I turned my shining black
eyes into each visitor's face.</TE>
<TE>   The people shouted, "Oh! He has the most beautiful eyes!"</TE>
<TE>   Suddenly, I heard a loud bark. Smokey ran up to the guests. He
raised his two front feet very high and caught a ball tossed in the
air by Terry.</TE>
<TE>   "A talented dog."</TE>
<TE>   "He looks very smart."</TE>
<TE>   "And he is handsome, too."</TE>
<TE>   Out of nowhere, Howard appeared with his five kittens. The guests
bent down to caress them.</TE>
<TE>   "They are so cute."</TE>
<TE>   "Look at this tiny body."</TE>
<TE>   "This one has silky fur, just like his father."</TE>
<TE>   Everyone easily forgot me.</TE>
<TE>   Mom came next to me and whispered, "Each one of you has your own
beauty."</TE>
<TE>   I looked closely at the other animals for the first time.</TE>
<TE>   My mother was right.</TE>
<TE>   Author Tran Mong Tu is from Vietnam. She says, "Moi Nguoi Mot Ve,"
which means, "you are pretty, someone is prettier; you are smart,
someone is smarter than you. Everyone has their own path."</TE>

<DH>Discussing gender differences without criticizing is easier

<AU>GENE WEINGARTEN</AU>
<BD>WASHINGTON POST</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>In a spirit of harmony and goodwill, feminism professor Gina Barreca
and I today will conduct our discussion as "a synectic session." This
is a classic tool of weenie management consultants in which both
parties are prohibited from being even slightly critical of the
other's ideas, and each idea must constructively build on the
previous one. Our topic is ways in which men and women can improve
their interpersonal relationships during the new year.</LD>
<LD>   Gene: In this joyous holiday postseason, I would like to begin by
respectfully expressing the hope that women discontinue their
near-ritual practice of positioning their behinds immediately in
front of the TV screen during critical third-down situations.</LD>
<LD>   Gina: Your observation is not only excellent but true. Females
often commit this transgression while performing janitorial duties
for males, who communicate their understandable displeasure with a
courtly back flap of the hand, the way you would keep sea gulls away
from your food. Usually this happens in the presence of a television
set the size of a pickup truck, which is the heterosexual man's sole
contribution to home decor. That's my wish for the new year: an end
to the large-appliance theory of interior design.</LD>
<TE>   Gene: What's wrong with big TVs?</TE>
<TE>   Gina: (stony silence)</TE>
<TE>   Gene: OK, I mean, your answer was simply delightful, with fairies
dancing on it and everything, but what's wrong with big TVs?</TE>
<TE>   Gina: Oh, nothing. They look elegant. That is why every time you
leaf through Architectural Digest, the focus of the room in the
French country manor is the 75-inch Toshiba with surround sound.</TE>
<TE>   Gene: I admit you make a worthy observation, vis-a-vis magazines
and women's higher degree of sophistication. No doubt, this is why
all women's magazines--magazines with no mission other than to
nourish the intellectual thirst of America's women--are entirely
about catching a man, keeping a man, losing weight to catch a man,
having sex to keep him, and shoes.</TE>
<TE>   Gina: Congratulations! You raise a fascinating point about keeping
a man, and the nature of relationships. Studies have actually shown
that the average woman who is about to leave her husband or boyfriend
wants to first set him up with some other woman. But if the average
man intends to leave his wife at midnight, and he is at a party with
her at 10 p.m., and some other guy is putting the moves on her, he'll
give the guy a dirty look and, if necessary, punch him out. To men,
romance is about possession. It is a contemptible character flaw.
Change that, why don't you? You know, for the new year.</TE>
<TE>   Gene: I compliment you on your clever parody of the hectoring,
strident, mannish harridan.</TE>
<TE>   Gina: Good for you. You yourself have broached yet another area in
which men need improvement. Stop applying double standards to women.
When we raise our voices in anything other than an eye-batting coo,
you contend we are being unladylike.</TE>
<TE>   Gene: An excellent argument, except where's the double standard?</TE>
<TE>   Gina: Good question. Men decry the unladylike only when it suits
them. For example, a [certain common yet slightly unorthodox sex act
not endorsed or even officially acknowledged by this newspaper] is
unladylike, yet I hear no complaints.</TE>
<TE>   Gene: Whoa.</TE>
<TE>   Gina: You bracketed me!</TE>
<TE>   Gene: I didn't. The editor did.</TE>
<TE>   Gina: He's a man, isn't he?</TE>
<TE>   Gene: Yes.</TE>
<TE>   Gina: Naturally. The issue involved intimacy, and he substituted
an ambiguous weaselly thought for a straightforward one. When
emotions are involved, men have serious communication impairment. You
guys need language labs. For example, what if I said, "I love you"?
What is the appropriate response?</TE>
<TE>   Gene: Um. . . .</TE>
<TE>   Gina: The appropriate response to "I love you" is either "Goodbye"
or "I love you, too." The appropriate response is not "I know" or
"Uh-huh." Or, for that matter, "Um."</TE>
<TE>   Gene: Gina?</TE>
<TE>   Gina: Yes?</TE>
<TE>   Gene: I just wanted to say. . . .</TE>
<TE>   Gina: Yes?</TE>
<TE>   Gene: Happy New Year.</TE>

<HD>A Workaholic Wife May Be Hazardous to His Health</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD MORIN</AU>
<BD>WASHINGTON POST</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Husbands, beware: Your wife's job may be dangerous to your health.</LD>
<LD>   At least that's one way to interpret the results of a study by
University of Chicago sociologist Ross Stolzenberg. He found that the
husbands of women who worked more than 40 hours a week were
significantly less healthy than other married men. At the same time,
his research showed that long hours at work by husbands had no
harmful effect on the health of their wives, employed or not.</LD>
<LD>   But there's another equally provocative way to interpret his
findings--perhaps best captured, Stolzenberg said, in what he called
the "wonderfully amusing title" of a 1970s-era journal article,
"Warning: The Male Sex Role May be Dangerous to Your Health."</LD>
<TE>   Stolzenberg's analysis, published recently in the American Journal
of Sociology, is based on survey data collected in 1986 from 2,867
adults, including their spouses, as part of the Americans' Changing
Lives survey conducted by the University of Michigan. Study
participants were interviewed again three years later.</TE>
<TE>   In both surveys, participants were asked to assess their overall
health on a scale that ranged from "excellent" to "poor."
(Researchers have consistently found that these kinds of general
self-ratings are more accurate than a doctor's evaluation,
Stolzenberg noted.) The surveys also solicited information about
employment, hours worked and other data.</TE>
<TE>   Stolzenberg confirmed what researchers already know: Marriage is
healthy. Married men and married women were significantly more likely
to report that they were in good health than single people, if other
important factors were held constant.</TE>
<TE>   Similarly, working long hours had no perceptible effect on the
health of either men or women. The additional time on the job
actually seemed to boost the well-being of most men. The surprise
came when he examined the effect of a wife's employment on her
husband. "Fewer than 40 hours of work per week by wives has no effect
on husbands' health, but more than 40 hours has substantial negative
effect," he reported.</TE>
<TE>   Why might a workaholic wife pose a health risk for a husband?
Stolzenberg says a big reason is that husbands and wives generally
still have different roles in a marriage--and maintaining the
family's health largely remains women's work.</TE>

<KH>THREE STRIKES</KH>
<HD>A Bad Law With No Reforms in Sight</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SASHA ABRAMSKY</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Two months ago, the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that a
shoplifter who had been given a three-strikes life sentence in
California for stealing $153 worth of videotapes had received a cruel
and unusual punishment. Yet, despite this decision, the political
leadership in Sacramento still shows no sign of being ready to
abandon the ill-considered law. State Atty. Gen. Bill Lockyer has
made it a policy to defend all such three-strikes convictions, and
thus it appears likely that the appellate court's ruling will be
challenged all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court. Meanwhile, with
vocal defenders of the law like California Secretary of State Bill
Jones opposing three-strikes reform, thousands of men continue to eke
out lost lives behind bars.</LD>
<LD>   One of those men is Billy Ochoa. Over the past few years, while
writing a book on the reasons America's prison population has grown
so large, I have gotten to know Billy well, visiting him several
times in prison, talking to him on the phone and corresponding by
mail. I was first drawn to his case because it seemed outlandish. I
quickly learned it was all too commonplace--an emblem of what has
gone wrong with parts of our country's criminal-justice system.</LD>
<TE>   Five and a half years ago, Billy Ochoa was sentenced to 326 years
in prison by a judge in Los Angeles. Ochoa was 53 at the time, a
heroin addict who'd never, as an adult, been convicted of a violent
crime. In the years since, he has lived in supermax housing at
prisons like New Folsom and Corcoran, often locked in his cell for
all but one hour a day. Occasionally he's allowed to play a game of
handball in the prison yard. More often, he sits in his cell idling
away the hours watching television or reading popular novels.</TE>
<TE>   It is costing the state about $50,000 a year to keep Ochoa inside
these ultra-secure prisons. If he lives into his 70s, California's
taxpayers will spend more than $1 million on his incarceration.</TE>
<TE>   As the recession has come into full bloom, politicians across the
country have begun looking for ways to scale back their budgets. And,
because prison expenditures have risen some 500% in the past 20
years, many states are now reexamining some of their more draconian
criminal-justice policies, laws that were crafted at the height of
the public panic over a perceived epidemic of lawlessness. After all,
crime rates haven't been so low in decades, and opinion polls are
finding that the electorate is now far more concerned about terrorism
and a slumping economy than about crime.</TE>
<TE>   Looking for ways to trim its corrections budget, Alabama recently
passed a law allowing nonviolent inmates who had been sentenced to
life under that state's habitual-offender statute to be released
early through parole hearings. Last summer, Louisiana abolished
mandatory minimum sentences for dozens of nonviolent crimes. In
Wisconsin, there is open discussion on ending "fail 'em and jail 'em"
mandatory minimums for low-level drug offenders.</TE>
<TE>   But even as conservative Southern states like Alabama are
reevaluating their habitual-offender laws, California has shown
little impulse to discard its catch-all three-strikes law. The state
certainly has a financial incentive to revisit the policy. Last
August, the Washington D.C.-based Sentencing Project issued a report
titled "Aging Behind Bars: 'Three Strikes' Seven Years Later." The
authors estimated that, with 1,200 three strikes inmates a year
currently entering the California prison system, by the year 2026 the
state would be imprisoning an estimated 30,000 three-strikers "at a
conservative cost of $750 million annually."</TE>
<TE>   Ochoa's story is a prime example of why this law must change.
Because he is a three-striker newly sentenced to a long prison term,
he is automatically deemed a flight risk and thus has been placed in
the highest-security prisons in the state. But, Ochoa doesn't fit the
profile of the kind of hard-core criminal three strikes was intended
to permanently remove from the streets. He's just a short man with
bad teeth, gray hair and a noticeable potbelly whose habit led him to
numerous arrests for drug possession and small-time burglaries.</TE>
<TE>   When Ochoa was last arrested (in the Northern California town of
Arcadia under the pseudonym of Richard Guttierez), it was because his
parole officer had discovered that he had applied for food stamps and
emergency-shelter vouchers under 13 aliases. When his drug cravings
grew too strong, he would head to a welfare office and apply for
emergency aid. He then sold his food stamps to get money for heroin.</TE>
<TE>   Ochoa's behavior was certainly seedy and illegal. But it was not
the action of a master criminal. In total, his fraud is estimated to
have cost the government $2,100. Even the prosecutor's office
recognized that the crimes were "wobblers"--actions that, at the
discretion of the district attorney's office, could either be tried
as high-level misdemeanors or as felonies. But because Ochoa had a
string of prior convictions, the case was prosecuted under three
strikes. Ultimately, he received 13 three-strikes sentences, each of
25 years, to be served consecutively, with an additional year thrown
in because he had been on parole for a similar crime at the time of
his rearrest.</TE>
<TE>   The dirty little secret of California's three-strikes law is that
it has always caught more petty criminals and repeat nuisances in its
net than it has murderers, kidnappers and rapists. As of mid-2001,
6,700 Californians, more than 2,700 of them from Los Angeles County,
had "struck out." Only 42% of the offenses for which they received
third strike sentences were crimes against persons. The rest were
crimes a lot like Ochoa's. Slightly more than 1,100 were burglaries;
more than 300 were petty theft with a prior; 200 were vehicle thefts;
35 were for driving while intoxicated; 60 for forgery or fraud. And
the list goes on. For these acts the perpetrators are now serving
life sentences. Moreover, fully 70% of strikeouts are handed down to
African American and Latino men, most of whom were too poor to afford
private lawyers.</TE>
<TE>   But, despite the grim statistics over eight years, three strikes
remains politically unchallengeable. The law was wielded to
devastating effect by California's former Gov. Pete Wilson as the
symbol of his "tough-on-crime" leadership during his 1994
gubernatorial campaign. Since then, politicians across the spectrum
have feared arousing the wrath of the electorate by even broaching
the subject of modifying it. Indeed, Democratic Gov. Gray Davis has
been one of its staunchest defenders.</TE>
<TE>   Now, more than ever, though, with America fighting a war to defend
its values and its liberties, our criminal-justice system should be
above reproach. Clumsy, discriminatory, vengeful laws like three
strikes serve only to weaken our country's claims to represent the
best and noblest impulses of the human spirit. On every level--from
the financial cost to the morally corrosive impact of such
disproportionate punishment--handing out life sentences to men like
Ochoa is wrong. It is long past time for the Legislature to admit
this folly and rectify the damage.</TE>

<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The quick U.S. military victory in Afghanistan and the return to
pre-Taliban life there have obscured a dangerous legacy of the
conflict: the deep distrust--and in some quarters, outright
hostility--that now marks the relationship between the United States
and the Muslim world. Unless relations are repaired, the next phase
of the U.S. war against terrorism will be imperiled.</LD>
<LD>   The Muslim world's reaction to the "smoking-gun" tape of Osama bin
Laden, in which the terrorist leader gloats about the destruction of
the World Trade Center, highlighted the problem. Although a majority
of Muslims think Bin Laden orchestrated the attack, significant
segments of Muslim public opinion believe the tape to be a
fabrication.</LD>
<TE>   This is in keeping with the dominant perception in the Muslim
world, rightly or wrongly, that the U.S. is targeting Muslims in its
war against terrorism and, accordingly, disproportionately killing
Muslims. How the U.S. has fought the war in Afghanistan and other
recent conflicts reinforces such beliefs. The U.S. reliance on
airpower and high-tech warfare in the Gulf War and in Kosovo resulted
in few American combat casualties and a far greater loss of life on
the ground, particularly in Iraq. In Afghanistan, Muslim killed
Muslim on the ground, and U.S. airpower killed Muslims from above.
Again, U.S. casualties have been minimal, while estimates of Muslims
killed aren't publicized for political reasons.</TE>
<TE>   Muslims also feel betrayed in their past relations with Americans.
The sudden U.S. withdrawal from South Asia in the late 1980s after
the defeat of the Soviet Union raised doubts in Muslim minds about
America's commitment to rebuilding their societies. And as they read
the list of future targets in the U.S. war against terrorism, they
see Muslim states and societies: Iraq, Somalia, Yemen, Lebanon,
Indonesia and areas of the Philippines.</TE>
<TE>   This perception of persecution enrages many Muslims. The Arab
press has many examples daily. Respected and mainstream newspapers
such as Egypt's Al Ahram or Saudi Arabia's Asharq al Awsat are
littered with opinion articles fearful of a clash of civilizations
between the Christian West and the Muslim East. Even when President
Bush endorsed the creation of a Palestinian state, many newspapers in
the Muslim world warned against "believing America's policies."
Commentators counseled their readers to wait and see. Thus far, they
seem to be right.</TE>
<TE>   To defeat terrorism, Washington needs to reverse this reflexive
distrust of its motives and aims in Muslim and Arab societies. This
will require nothing short of a vigorous public diplomacy campaign in
the Muslim world, a task greatly complicated by the escalation of
violence in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Arab public opinion
matters, and it is currently very angry at Israel because of its
military conduct in the occupied territories and its treatment of
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat.</TE>
<TE>   But the worst move the U.S. could take, one that would surely
deepen Muslim distrust of America, would be to attack Iraq, as some
advisors of President Bush have urged. In the least, the
sustainability of the U.S. anti-terrorism campaign would be seriously
jeopardized by such an action.</TE>
<TE>   Make no mistake about it. Saddam Hussein is a menace to both world
peace and to the stability of the Middle East. But now is absolutely
the wrong moment to attack him because the U.S. must first persuade
Arabs and Muslims that hitting Hussein would not be a war on Islam.
The key to U.S. victory in Afghanistan was the cooperation of Afghans
who detested the Taliban. We need to make new friends in Iraq who
loathe Hussein--the U.S.-backed Iraqi opposition was wiped out by
Hussein in 1996--and win the support of Arab and Muslim public
opinion worldwide. So far, the U.S. has failed to do this.</TE>
<TE>   Mainstream Muslims clearly understood why the United States went
to war in Afghanistan to get Bin Laden and Al Qaeda. It was a matter
of self-defense. But Iraq has not attacked Americans on U.S. soil. A
case can certainly be made that Hussein is a worthy target because
his regime has abused its citizens and developed weapons of mass
destruction that threaten regional stability. But it is a separate
case from the U.S. campaign against terrorism. If the U.S. takes on
Iraq in the name of fighting terrorism, many Muslims will be believe
it is instead another phase of the war against Islam.</TE>
<TE>   A strong U.S. role in rebuilding Afghanistan will help erase this
perception and justify going after Iraq. Washington needs to convince
Iraqis that their country can benefit from Hussein's fall as much as
Afghanistan stands to benefit from the defeat of the Taliban. One of
the main criticisms of the U.S. anti-terrorism campaign in
Afghanistan was that military victory outpaced the politics of
creating a sustainable alternative to the Taliban. The slow pace of
providing humanitarian aid further complicated the situation. Thus,
it is important the U.S. do everything in its power to ensure that
the interim government in Afghanistan works well and gains the
confidence of Afghans. It is similarly important that Afghans believe
that the U.S. is in their country for the long haul. I'm not saying
that Kabul should be the city on the hill in Muslim eyes. Rather, if
the U.S. wants Muslims to believe that Bin Laden is a force of evil
and destruction, it must convince Muslims that America is a force of
good. Helping to rebuild Afghanistan will go a long way toward
creating such an impression.</TE>
<TE>   America needs the intellectual equivalent of the Northern
Alliance, an army of Muslim intellectuals, to fight the war for the
hearts and minds of Muslims. Building such support will take time,
but if America intends to sustain its campaign against terrorism, it
should start courting Muslim and Arab public opinion now. It surely
shouldn't attack another Muslim country.</TE>

<DL>LONDON</DL>
<LD>While most of Europe will unite under a single currency in 2002,
Afghanistan faces the new year with four separate ones, all called
afghani and mostly counterfeit.</LD>
<LD>   With the afghani trading, even at the highest-end official rate,
at nearly 5,000 to the dollar, Afghanistan's much-maligned money is
not the most portable of currencies. And it represents a serious
stumbling block to the government of national reconciliation, headed
by Interim Prime Minister Hamid Karzai, which took office on Dec. 22
and will officially wield power for the next six months. Controlling
the supply of afghani--or "afs," as they are known--would be the
first vital step toward bringing to heel the wayward warlords who
have retaken power in most provinces of Afghanistan since the start
of the U.S.-led bombing campaign against the Taliban last October.</LD>
<LD>   Since 1996, with Russian help, Afghan warlords have counterfeited
their national currency in bulk to pad out their treasuries and
ensure an unremitting supply of local mercenaries to staff their
private armies. The Northern Alliance, in particular, used access to
the original currency printing plates as a tool of economic war in a
bid to weaken the Taliban's control of the country's informal money
markets.</LD>
<TE>   Although Northern Alliance leaders have taken key portfolios in
the transitional government, Karzai still needs to stabilize the
afghani if it is to make the best use of the $7 billion to $9 billion
in foreign aid expected to be committed at a donor conference for
reconstruction to be held later this month in Tokyo.</TE>
<TE>   The official money regulator, the Afghanistan National Bank (ANB),
has not issued a new bill since the fall of Kabul to the Taliban and
will be hard-pressed to impose any discipline on the three local and
two international currencies that currently underpin what remains of
the Afghan economy.</TE>
<TE>   "There is only one solution," said the ANB general secretary Ullah
Mohammed Fayez recently, "To get rid of all the money in circulation
and print new notes." But a currency-exchange operation is
unimaginable among a population that has dealt entirely in cash since
the collapse of the communist regime of President Najibullah in 1992.</TE>
<TE>   Few banks are open for business, and most Afghans live far beyond
the reach of the radio announcements that would alert them to such
any changeover in money. And while most merchants use the U.S. dollar
or the Pakistani rupee to finance their import-dependent businesses,
ordinary Afghans still depend upon the local currency for most of
their transactions. To cancel the currency in one fell swoop would be
to court a disaster of both public order and public well-being.</TE>
<TE>   The Taliban's connection to the afghani has always been odd.
Taliban fighters stuffed the currency in their enemies' mouths as a
sign of contempt when they captured Kabul in 1996, then looted them
by the truckload five years later when driven from the capital on
Nov. 12. And while the movement professed to rule 90% of the country,
its cash was almost entirely supplied by printers working in Russia
for the Northern Alliance and the other opposition groups that
controlled the remaining 10% of Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   When the forces of ousted President Burhanuddin Rabbani were
expelled by the Taliban from Kabul, they spirited away the printing
plates to Russia. Whenever the U.N.-recognized President Rabbani
needed money, to pay his men or to buy dollars on the informal
markets that control the currency exchange business in the absence of
a central bank, he simply sent word to his Russian printers to run
off a fresh supply. This cash then trickled across the front lines to
Taliban-controlled areas of the country, where it continued to be
recognized as official tender.</TE>
<TE>   When the Taliban attempted to crack down on the practice by
banning post-1996 bills on the basis of their serial numbers,
Rabbani's printers manufactured new afghanis with pre-1996 numbers.</TE>
<TE>   Consequently, there are now four versions of the currency in
circulation, some with identical numbers, and all with varying rates
of exchange. The first, considered the cream of the "old money"
supply, dates from 1973 and bears a portrait of ex-king Mohammad
Zaher Shah. Much in demand, it trades at a rate 15% stronger even
than other "old bills." A second set of "old bills" dates from before
1996 and is also considered "old money," if not as valuable as the
earlier bills. A third currency, "new money," has higher serial
numbers, originates in Russia and is worth less. A fourth set,
produced by the Uzbek warlord Gen. Abdul Rashid Dostum to provide
liquidity for his northern mini-state, also trade at a significant
discount.</TE>
<TE>   In spite of the fiscal disorder, money-changers can tell at a
glance which of the different afghanis they are being asked to
handle. Moreover, exchange rates in Kabul's Shahzada currency market,
a warren housing 300 different trading operations, fluctuate with
confident precision, even though their market indicators come chiefly
by cell phone or radio reports.</TE>
<TE>   How long this byzantine, but ultimately free-market system can
survive in the post-Taliban era remains to be seen. Shahzada's
traders have seen a sharp strengthening of the afghani since
September on the promise of future aid and an avalanche of
reconstruction funding.</TE>
<TE>   While the lion's share of the aid will be spent outside the
country on relief food or new equipment for Afghanistan's shattered
infrastructure, a large sum will still percolate down to Shahzada and
similar money markets as aid agencies seek to acquire afghanis to pay
local salaries and suppliers.</TE>
<TE>   The newly appointed finance minister in Karzai's transitional
government, Hedayat Amin Arsala, says he had received Russia's
assurances that it will henceforth only print currency orders from
the Afghan central bank. But with the afghani strengthening daily,
and untold quantities under lock and key in the fortresses of local
warlords, it's anyone's guess just how long that confident agreement
will last.</TE>

<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>President Bush was properly distressed when a draft of the proposed
rules for military tribunals was leaked. Clearly, the rules to
prosecute suspected terrorists haven't been completely thought out.
Furthermore, if the proposed rules governing tribunal proceedings
aren't further modified, they may undermine the purpose the tribunals
were intended to have when the president issued his order creating
them--to facilitate the war against terrorism.</LD>
<LD>   So far, it appears the Pentagon is following a restrained course
in formulating the rules. Yet some of the proposed regulations are
too generous.</LD>
<LD>   There is nothing wrong with the tribunals operating in public to
enhance confidence in their outcomes, except when classified
information needs to be safeguarded. But there is everything wrong
with demanding an evidentiary standard of proof beyond a reasonable
doubt. The late Supreme Court Justice William J. Brennan Jr. thought
this standard necessary to ensure the liberty of individuals "going
about ordinary affairs." But there is nothing ordinary about the
destructive aims of terrorists.</LD>
<TE>   This standard is well-suited for trying a single civilian
defendant accused of a crime that can be prosecuted with eyewitness
testimony. It makes sense when witnesses are just a subpoena away,
when there is routine crime-scene evidence or an abundance of
financial or other documentation.</TE>
<TE>   But a standard of proof beyond reasonable doubt is hardly
compatible with a proceeding for ferreting out a network of terrorist
cells, expeditiously punishing terrorist ring leaders and preventing
future attacks. It is especially unsuitable for a trial based on
intelligence intercepts and informants who necessarily must operate
with less substantiation. Nor does it make sense when witnesses are
just as likely to be crossing the Pakistan border as hiding in a cave
in Tora Bora.</TE>
<TE>   The historical standard applied in World War II was the pragmatic
one of more probable than not, or preponderance. War crimes then were
difficult to prove. But surely crimes of terrorism committed by
clandestine outlaws worldwide pose a greater difficulty.</TE>
<TE>   The draft tribunal rules do allow the government greater leeway on
the admissibility of evidence, and this is prudent. Tribunal
proceedings should not be encumbered with the myriad of procedural
objections that defense attorneys can raise in civilian courts. The
draft's unanimous-vote requirement for a death sentence is also
appropriate, but it should not be uniformly necessary. When imposing
lesser penalties, the two-thirds vote originally proposed by the
president is better.</TE>
<TE>   While the privilege against self-incrimination should be observed
once charges are brought against a suspected terrorist, the
tribunal's final rules should make it clear that any information
obtained through noncoercive battlefield interrogation is not
similarly protected. Terrorists are not supplied counsel in the
trenches. It is simply illogical to think that the absence of an
attorney or the privilege against self-incrimination should impede
the gathering of information from battlefield detainees. Under
international treaty, detainees need not answer beyond revealing
name, rank and serial number. Yet, no treaty provides that if
additional information is gained in such interrogation it cannot be
used in a military trial. The exclusionary rule applicable to police
investigations, or even garden-variety court-martials, simply doesn't
fit.</TE>
<TE>   The drafting of the rules that will govern tribunal proceedings
continues. As it does, the president must not risk losing the
advantage the tribunals can give to the military campaign against
terrorism.</TE>

<LD>The Democratic Party has a growing problem with Catholic voters. In
2000, George W. Bush nearly split the Catholic vote with Al Gore,
after former President Bill Clinton had carried Catholics by 16
percentage points four years earlier. In last month's New York City
mayor's race, Catholics overwhelmingly supported Republican Michael
Bloomberg over Democrat Mark Green.</LD>
<LD>   For most of the last century, Catholics were a mainstay of the
Democratic Party. In 1928, Democrats nominated the first Catholic to
run for president, Al Smith. The first Catholic elected president was
Democrat John F. Kennedy in 1960. It was not inaccurate to tag
Democrats the party for Catholics and Republicans the party for
Protestants.</LD>
<LD>   But sometimes Democrats seem biased against, and often
contemptuous of, positions of the Roman Catholic hierarchy. This
development could provide an opening for Republicans, which could be
especially important in California, where the church-going Catholic
electorate is increasingly Asian--especially Filipinos and
Vietnamese--and Latino.</LD>
<TE>   The Democrats' problem is the result of a clash between its old
Catholic constituency and its newer members, especially feminists and
gay-rights activists, in the context of the cultural divide that was
so evident in the 2000 election. Bush ran far ahead of the usual GOP
vote in rural America and with regular church attendees; he also won
among married voters and women who stay at home with children.</TE>
<TE>   In California, the Democratic strain with Catholic voters goes
beyond the cultural clash. The party's strong stand on certain social
issues puts it at odds with several official Catholic positions. Gov.
Gray Davis, although a Catholic, has imposed a pro-abortion-rights
litmus test for his judicial appointments that goes well beyond being
just pro-choice. The Democratic Party strongly opposed Proposition
22, a successful measure on the 2000 ballot that defined marriage as
a union between a man and a woman, while Catholic bishops, citing the
church's traditional teaching, supported it. The bishops also object
to embryonic stem cell research, which most California Democrats
support.</TE>
<TE>   None of these issues alone will drive ordinary Catholic voters
away from the Democratic Party. It has been several generations since
the bishops could deliver the Catholic vote. But a case now making
its way through the California courts raises the question whether
state Democratic leaders are going beyond policy disagreements to
target the religious practices of Catholic organizations.</TE>
<TE>   In 1999, at the bidding of Planned Parenthood of California, the
Democratic-controlled Legislature passed the Women's Contraceptive
Equity Act, co-authored by Assembly Speaker Robert M. Hertzberg
(D-Sherman Oaks) and Sen. Jackie Speier (D-Hillsborough), requiring
religious charities, hospitals and colleges to provide contraceptive
benefits to their employees. Last July, Catholic Charities of
California sued on freedom-of-religion grounds, contending that it
should not be forced to provide birth-control devices if, as a
religious institution, it chooses not to.</TE>
<TE>   But the real political damage for Democrats may lie in church
leaders' accusations that the legislation smacks of officially
endorsed bigotry against Catholics. They assert that the pope was
ridiculed and the church compared to a witch's coven as the bill
moved through the Legislature. Church leaders also worry that the
bill is part of a larger effort by feminist groups and their
Democratic allies to force Catholic hospitals to provide abortion on
demand, a matter of growing public debate as the number of
Catholic-owned hospitals increases in California. The issue for many
Catholics is not so much the legal one of whether Catholic Charities
is a business that, as such, should be treated as a secular
institution. Rather, it is one of respect: Is there any room left in
the Democratic Party for the traditionalist Catholic viewpoint?</TE>
<TE>   David Carlin, the former Democratic majority leader of the Rhode
Island Senate, doesn't think so. In an article titled "How Can a
Catholic Be a Democrat?", Carlin complains that his party is not only
pro-abortion, but also in favor of same-sex marriage,
physician-assisted suicide, stem-cell research and even cloning
embryos. "If you're a Catholic," he writes, "how can you possibly
continue to be a Democrat when the Democratic Party can be relied on
to support the rejection of Christian values and their replacement by
un-Christian or anti-Christian values?"</TE>
<TE>   Carlin's views are probably not shared by mainstream California
Catholics, but they touch a nerve. If the Democrats are viewed as
cavalier toward Catholic sensibilities, they could be in for the same
shock that hit Republicans after they championed anti-immigrant
policies in the 1990s. The GOP not only stirred up a political
backlash among pro-Democratic Latinos and Asians, it also lost its
political base among these groups. In California, Catholic moral
positions may be less defined among white voters--fewer people
identify themselves as Irish or Italian Democrats in the way Catholic
voting blocs once did--but more defined among Latinos. Although the
anti-gay Proposition 22 passed among all voters, Latinos supported it
by margins 10% higher than any other group.</TE>
<TE>   The Catholic Church has deep ties with Latino voters. Its bishops
were strong supporters of Cesar Chavez and the United Farm Union. In
the 1980s, Southern evangelical Christians moved away from their
historic home in the Democratic Party; in recent elections, Italian
and Irish Catholics seem to be doing the same thing. These national
trends may not have reached California yet, but what if churchgoing
Latinos and Asians begin to sense an anti-Catholic bias among
California Democrats? The impact on California politics could be
direct and immediate.</TE>
<TE>   Republicans, to be sure, will grasp at any straw in their comeback
effort in California, and the Bush administration has zealously
courted Latino voters throughout the country. Twice before, in the
1960s with Ronald Reagan and in the 1970s with Proposition 13,
Republicans recovered when Democrats alienated their core
constituencies. In the 1960s, it was working-class voters; in the
1970s, it was middle-income homeowners. Will Democrats give
Republicans a third chance by alienating Catholics?</TE>

<HD>A Religious Moment</HD>
<DH>Osama bin Laden's fanaticism should prompt us to examine
our own religious beliefs-- and to zealously preserve our secular
society.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD RODRIGUEZ</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>SAN FRANCISCO</DL>
<LD>After the names and the utterances of prime ministers and secretaries
of war are forgotten, after the madmen in the desert have been hunted
down and killed, after the capable youth of today's soldiers has been
undermined by the blessing of a long life, history will, I think,
remember this time--our lifetime--as a religious moment, both
dangerous and capable of great grace.</LD>
<LD>   This is, or should be, a deeply embarrassing time for anyone in
America who claims to be "religious." On videotape, Osama bin Laden
celebrates death and destruction with joyful invocations to God. What
we see in the face of our adversary--this Muslim terrorist--is the
mad glint of the otherworldly, as ancient as religious belief.</LD>
<LD>   As a Christian, I have been forced by the angry, bearded face of
Islam in recent months to wonder about my own religious face.</LD>
<TE>   I believe, through history, organized religion has done more good
than harm in the world. This is not a dashed-off piety--I really
believe it. My Roman Catholicism has encouraged me to do good in the
world, to prize love above all other emotions.</TE>
<TE>   But Muslims speak of the "Crusades" as a fresh offense! And I
cannot forget now that religion--mine certainly--has caused havoc in
the world, brought destruction to "infidel" and "heretic" in the name
of God.</TE>
<TE>   Not without reason did the founders of America establish a secular
society. America, the daughter of the Enlightenment, was imagined as
a country where all could worship freely.</TE>
<TE>   The secular state's protection of all religious and nonreligious
belief has been interpreted by some Americans, in recent decades, as
an excuse to remove religion from our public life altogether or
denigrate it (as post-modern Hollywood regularly does in its comic
portrayals of Christianity). But at its best, the American secular
state has protected religious rights in America, protects, not
coincidentally, Muslims today.</TE>
<TE>   It serves Bin Laden to ignore the point of our secularism. He is,
or portrays himself as, too medieval to understand us. He describes
America as a "Jewish-Christian" alliance, thereby attempting to
separate Muslims from our national company.</TE>
<TE>   President Bush's great patriotism at this time has been his
insistence that U.S. military action against terrorists is not a war
against Islam. He has been photographed with American Muslim clerics,
has dined with them in the White House and has prayed with them.</TE>
<TE>   Less impressive has been the gaudy parade of American clerics and
ministers who seem unable, or unwilling, to address the dark
implications for religious belief of Sept. 11. Catholic bishops
merely assure us that ours is a "just war." The Rev. Jerry Falwell
deciphers the events of Sept. 11 as God's wrath against gays and
abortionists. And from Billy Graham's son, Frank, we hear a hymn of
Christian triumphalism against Islam.</TE>
<TE>   Confrontation with the darker aspect of religion--thus of
ourselves--is difficult for America. Despite 19th-century persecution
of Mormons on our soil, for example, or the trampling of American
Indian spirituality by pioneers, the country has generally been free
of religious conflict.</TE>
<TE>   Beyond our borders, we have not cast ourselves as religious
warriors. We went to war, for example, against the empire of Japan,
not against an emperor who was said to be a god in the Shinto
religion. And after World War II, Americans grew accustomed to a Cold
War enemy that was simply "godless."</TE>
<TE>   Now, however, we face a self-proclaimed religious adversary, a
circumstance unprecedented in our history. Most embarrassing for me
is that this adversary's religious belief causes me to question my
own. For the God that he professes is also mine, in a foreign
translation.</TE>
<TE>   After Sept. 11, it is oddly pertinent to notice how the three
desert religions--Judaism, Christianity and Islam, the three
religions that are claimed by most Americans--can become, not a way
of life, but a cult of death.</TE>
<TE>   Jewish settlers in the West Bank make an eschatological claim on
the land. Muslims, dreaming of a paradise that resembles the Playboy
Mansion, chant the name of Allah as they slam jetliners into office
towers. And some Christians, though not the sort who get polled by
Gallup or interviewed on CNN, speak of waiting for the Rapture, the
Endtime.</TE>
<TE>   It is, I know, not completely fair to equate these great religions
in this way. As a minority faith, a faith of the "chosen," Judaism is
not a universalist religion, has never sought to be. It is,
therefore, less inclined than Christianity or Islam to persecute
other faiths in the quest for converts.</TE>
<TE>   But from Judaism came a monotheistic theology, crucial for the
development of Christianity and Islam, an idea about God that is both
wonderful and dangerous. The idea basic to Judaism is that God acts
in history and thus shapes it.</TE>
<TE>   If God acts in history, then we are not alone, our lives are not
meaningless, our sensibilities are not mockery and our history not
mere confusion. This is the overwhelming consolation of Jewish belief
that watered all religions of the desert.</TE>
<TE>   But the dangerous aspect of this theological insight is that the
God who acts in history becomes decipherable to us, indeed becomes a
partner to our wishes (rather than the reverse), even chooses to be
on our side. Yahweh or God or Allah ends up a prisoner of his
followers who assume his will.</TE>
<TE>   President Bush is not the first president to end his speeches with
the prayer "God bless America"--it has become a sort of platitude of
political oratory. Though that invocation now sounds differently--and
seriously--an echo of Islamic militancy. We should not be unaware of
the implications of such a prayer within a political speech, how
easily religion can be drafted.</TE>
<TE>   I think of Pope John Paul II, instead, whose papacy may end up
most remembered for the litany of apologies he has made for his
church's misdeeds in centuries past. In early December, the pope
encouraged Catholics worldwide to fast on the last day of Ramadan,
and thus to share in the spirituality of the Islamic world.</TE>
<TE>   The pope's suggestion, though little broadcast in the United
States, seems to me a particularly valuable one for the future--and
nowhere in the world more so than in the United States, where
Methodist lives next door to Jew who lives next door to Muslim who
lives next door to atheist.</TE>
<TE>   Precisely because I live in secular America I find myself able to
admire people whose religious faith is not my own. And I feel my own
faith burnished by their good example.</TE>
<TE>   I do not forget, however, that secular Europe and North America
have given birth to dark sons--from John Walker in California to
Richard Reid in London--sons who end up warring against the freedom
and the religious and irreligious diversity of their neighborhoods.</TE>
<TE>   But the secular state of America might also nurture a new sort of
believer, a new sort of Catholic, a new sort of Baptist, a new sort
of atheist. A new sort of Muslim, as well, who professes Islam within
the cosmopolitan and diverse city.</TE>
<TE>   This American Muslim could end up the bright grace for us all in
this dark religious moment.</TE>

30, by which time Congress must decide whether to reauthorize the law
as written or to make changes. Already, debate is heating up.</LD>
<LD>   This week, the Los Angeles County Commission for Public Social
Services will consider several proposals developed by advocates for
the law's revision. The county, which has the nation's largest
welfare caseload, is being asked to sponsor these positions in the
upcoming national debate on reauthorization. They are excellent
ideas.</LD>
<LD>   The first proposal calls for new ways of measuring the reforms'
success, keeping in mind the "centrality of the law's concern with
poor children." It urges measuring success not merely by "reductions
in caseload size and cost," but also by examining whether the number
of children living in poverty is going down.</LD>
<TE>   Welfare--whether the current Temporary Assistance for Needy
Families (TANF) or the former Aid to Families with Dependent Children
(AFDC)--is primarily a program for poor children. Indigent adults are
not eligible for welfare payments. Adults are eligible for financial
assistance only if they serve as caregivers for eligible indigent
children, who are the law's central concern. The current emphasis on
moving adults from welfare to work, while a major step forward in
promoting a family's ability to care for its own, has distracted
public attention from the program's primary interest in protecting
the well-being of children.</TE>
<TE>   Why is reaffirming that focus important? Since the passage of
reform welfare caseloads have declined by almost 50% nationally. The
national child poverty rate, however, has declined at a much slower
rate: from one in every five American children to one in every six
(leaving us still with the highest percentage of poor children in the
developed world).</TE>
<TE>   The contrasting trajectories of sharply declining welfare
caseloads and more modestly declining child poverty rates suggest
that fewer and fewer of the nation's impoverished children may be
assisted by this legislation. Further, while increasing numbers of
welfare recipients are employed, and the overall child poverty rate
is down, the Children's Defense Fund, using recent census data,
reports that the number of poor children living in families with
full-time employed parents has actually increased. It is evident that
labor force participation by parents does not, in itself, assure the
economic well-being of the nation's children.</TE>
<TE>   Studies of child poverty show clearly that children left in
poverty suffer disproportionately from untreated health problems and
often cannot benefit from education because they are too ill, hungry
or subject to the many instabilities which poverty visits on the
lives of families.</TE>
<TE>   The second proposal the county is being asked to back would urge
the federal government to stop the clock on limits to time on welfare
when a recipient is taking concrete steps to find employment.</TE>
<TE>   Public opinion supports time limits on dependency and opposes any
system that fosters inter-generational dependency. A five-year
lifetime limit on benefits makes sense, but we need to distinguish
between time limits on "dependency" and time limits on a
participant's "full effort" to seek stable employment. TANF now
allows stopping the clock in limited circumstances of exceptional
need. That authority should be expanded to stop the clock when
participants are engaged in approved activities to prepare themselves
for self-sufficiency. Activities that qualify to stop the clock
should be those specifically intended to remove obstacles to
employment, like education, job training, treatment of mental
illness, overcoming learning or physical disabilities, substance
abuse and control of domestic violence.</TE>
<TE>   We need to allow families an opportunity to overcome the barriers
that block their progress from welfare to work. Reports from the
Economic Roundtable, a nonprofit public policy research group in Los
Angeles, make it clear that despite tenacious efforts to remain in
the labor force progress by families over the last five years has
been slow even in a favorable labor market. Time limits can serve as
an incentive to motivate progress toward economic independence if
those time limits recognize and support the actual efforts made by
participants to find their way into the labor force.</TE>
<TE>   A third proposal the county is being asked to support would
advocate removing obstacles to the more flexible use of education and
training in welfare reform efforts. Welfare recipients are a
heterogeneous population. Some could benefit immediately from the
discipline and responsibilities of work. For others, access to
education or training may be the best pathway to employment.</TE>
<TE>   Regulations which focus only on moving participants into jobs as
quickly as possible can trap low-skilled workers in poverty wage
jobs, recycling them through repeated experiences of temporary
sub-poverty employment. A "one-size-fits-all" approach to employment
cannot fit lives so varied in shape and form. The current one-year
federal limit on education and job training should be eliminated.
Many welfare recipients could lift their families out of poverty if
provided with opportunities to strengthen their job skills through
selective use of education, vocational training and work experience.</TE>
<TE>   TANF reauthorization must address the counterproductive limits on
education and training contained in federal law and regulation.
States should be given greater flexibility in the use of programs of
education, the traditional pathway for America's poor to a better
life. States should be encouraged to provide incentives for
participants to enter such programs allowing a second chance at
success for the many who associate school with past experiences of
failure and futility.</TE>
<TE>   It is useful to remember that welfare reform is not so much an
achievement as it is a process that we need to keep working at to get
it right. The current reauthorization review by Congress presents an
opportunity to move that process forward--an opportunity we should
not waste.</TE>

<HD>Three War Stars Are Born</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>WILLIAM SCHNEIDER</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>"Star Wars" is fiction. But war stars is a fact. Wars create popular
heroes. And political stars. It goes all the way back to the
beginning of the republic--George Washington, Ulysses S. Grant,
Theodore Roosevelt, Dwight D. Eisenhower, Colin L. Powell.</LD>
<LD>   And now, who? Well, to start with, Rudolph W. Giuliani.</LD>
<LD>   Rarely has a politician seen his image transformed so quickly and
so dramatically. Remember last summer when the New York tabloids were
filled with stories about Mayor Giuliani's scandalous personal life?
After Sept. 11, Giuliani appeared with his girlfriend all over New
York--and overseas--and nobody seemed to notice. Or care. Giuliani's
pitch-perfect response to the terrorist attacks made him a hero and
an inspiration. The percentage of Americans who say Giuliani has done
a "very good'' job of responding to the terrorist attacks: 61 (in a
Time magazine mid-December poll). Percentage of Americans who say
President Bush has done a "very good'' job of responding to the
terrorist attacks: 53 in late October.</LD>
<TE>   The old Giuliani was petty and vindictive. The new Giuliani is ...
well, petty and vindictive. At a farewell meeting in Brooklyn last
month, the mother of a policeman rose to ask the mayor why the city
had not given police officers a long overdue pay raise. "What you
just did isn't right,'' the mayor said sharply. "I can't negotiate a
contract with you now. You shouldn't have done this.'' And that is
one reason why, despite his Churchillian stature, Giuliani's
political future is cloudy. He has an outsized personality and a
difficult temperament. He does not, as they used to say in school,
work and play well with others.</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Giuliani? It's hard to see him going along or getting along
with 99 colleagues. Vice President Giuliani? A vice president's job
is to be loyal and self-abasing. That's not him. Gov. Giuliani?
That's the role most people see him in. But he'll have to wait five
years, since New York's Republican Gov. George Pataki is running for
a third term this year. President Giuliani? He'd be a formidable
contender. He's already impressed the country with his presidential
qualities. But he has to find a party that will nominate him.
Conservatives distrust him. He's pro-choice, pro-gay rights and
pro-gun control. And, anyway, the GOP nomination won't be open for
another seven years, during which time Giuliani has to figure out a
way to stay in the spotlight.</TE>
<TE>   A presidential appointment, maybe. Some kind of reconstruction
czar. If anyone was ever born to be a czar, it's Giuliani. But Bush
needs to keep Giuliani at arm's length. He's already overshadowed the
president once.</TE>
<TE>   Another unlikely war star has emerged out of the ranks of the
GOP-- Secretary of Defense Donald H. Rumsfeld. Before Sept. 11,
Rumsfeld was a retread. He first served as defense secretary in the
Gerald R. Ford administration--more than 26 years ago.</TE>
<TE>   Now he's a TV star. Rumsfeld's daily press briefings are cool,
crisp and authoritative. He speaks to the American people like he's
speaking to grown-ups. In polished sentences and paragraphs. Without
spin. When a reporter asked him what's being done with prisoners of
war being held by the Pakistanis, Rumsfeld replied, "I'm not as
knowledgeable as I might be in 24 hours.'' Rumsfeld's briefings are a
metaphor. The U.S. is in control of the military situation, just as
Rumsfeld is in control of the press. "[Osama bin Laden] is important.
We're after him. We intend to find him. I believe we will,'' Rumsfeld
said on Dec. 19. "And if he turns up somewhere thumbing his nose at
you?'' a reporter asked. Rumsfeld replied, "We will go see about that
thumb.'' In other words: trust us. We know what we're doing.</TE>
<TE>   In effect, Rumsfeld is doing what Vice President Dick Cheney was
supposed to do. He's a reassuring presence in an administration
headed by a president with little national or international
experience. Meanwhile, Cheney is in an "undisclosed, secure
location." Where he may remain in 2004. If the international
situation is still tense, Rumsfeld would be a good choice for the
No.2 spot on the GOP ticket.</TE>
<TE>   The Democrats have their own war star--Senate Majority Leader Tom
Daschle. Daschle was propelled into prominence by two unlikely events
last year. The first was in June, when Vermont Sen. James M. Jeffords
startled the political world by leaving the Republican Party to
become an independent. That made Daschle the new Senate majority
leader--and the highest-ranking Democrat in Washington.</TE>
<TE>   Then, in October, Daschle was the target of an anthrax attack. The
attack was so virulent it forced senators to vacate their offices for
months. And magnified Daschle's image of importance. Once an obscure
senator from an obscure state (South Dakota), Daschle has become an
assured figure who rallies Democrats and infuriates Republicans. Why?
Because the majority leader came up with a devious plan: He said
Democrats should stand squarely with the president on the war while
opposing Bush's domestic agenda.</TE>
<TE>   What's devious about that? It's the way most Democrats feel. But
it's driving Republicans crazy. They're trying to depict Daschle's
opposition as disloyalty. What it is is partisanship. On issues that
have nothing to do with the war, and where partisanship has always
prevailed. Conservatives ran a newspaper ad in South Dakota picturing
Daschle side by side with Saddam Hussein. The implication? Daschle is
in league with the Iraqi dictator because he opposes oil drilling in
Alaska's Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.</TE>
<TE>   They ran a radio ad in Daschle's home state accusing the majority
leader of plotting "to use the economy as a campaign issue." So, what
else is new? Well, there's the implication, spelled out in the ad,
that Democrats blocked passage of Bush's economic stimulus package
because they "really don't want the recession to end." Daschle's
defense? "We want to pass something but we don't want to pass
anything."</TE>
<TE>   In a memo to Senate Republicans, GOP strategist Frank Luntz wrote,
"Remember what the Democrats did to [former House Speaker Newt]
Gingrich? We need to do exactly the same thing to Daschle."</TE>
<TE>   Memo to Luntz: Tom Daschle isn't Newt Gingrich. Daschle comes
across as mild-mannered and soft-spoken--a nice guy. Yeah, Luntz said
in an interview, "He's so nice, so unassuming, that you'll never see
the knife until it's in your back."</TE>
<TE>   The fact is, the economy has surpassed terrorism as a public
concern. Does that mean the memory of Sept. 11 is fading? No. It
means the war on terrorism is going well, while the economy is not
going well. Republicans want to turn public support for Bush Agenda
II--the war on terrorism--into support for Bush Agenda
I--"compassionate conservatism." But they've got Daschle standing in
their way.</TE>
<TE>   The number of people who support Bush--more than 80%--is
noticeably higher than the number who say they agree with him on the
issues (about 60%). News flash: You can support the president even if
you don't agree with him. Especially at a time like this.</TE>
<TE>   That's what Daschle is saying. He's saying it so well, it's making
him a contender for the presidency in 2004.</TE>
<TE>   Daschle's star is rising while Al Gore's is falling. Last month, a
Gallup poll asked Democrats whether they would like to see their
party nominate Gore for president in 2004 "or someone else." The
winner?</TE>
<TE>   "Someone else," 66% to 26%.</TE>
<TE>   Gore does a lot better among Democrats who believe Bush stole the
election. But the number of Democrats who believe Bush stole the
election has been dropping. It's now down to 25%.</TE>
<TE>   The Democrats' war star is Daschle. Gore is a war casualty.</TE>

<HD>Car Rental Company Has New Safety Seat System</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A new system to anchor child safety seats is being offered by Avis
Rent A Car System Inc. at its rental sites in more than 40 cities,
including Los Angeles and Orlando, Fla.</LD>
<LD>   The system, called Lower Anchors and Tethers for Children, or
LATCH, requires metal anchor bars to be installed in back seats, to
which the child seat can be strapped. Federal law requires all cars
manufactured after Sept. 1 this year to be equipped with LATCH, which
is designed to provide a more secure and easier-to-use mounting.</LD>
<LD>   Avis spokesman Ted Deutsch said the company finished training its
employees and installing the system last month. He said it should be
available by advance request.</LD>
<TE>   In another change affecting families with small children, a new
California state law that took effect Jan. 1 requires children to
ride in a car or booster seat that meets federal safety standards
until they are 6 years old or weigh at least 60 pounds. Previously
the cutoff was age 4 or 40 pounds. Fines increased from $50 to $100
for first offenses and from $100 to $250 for second offenses.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>LAS VEGAS--The T-shirts flutter in the breeze beneath the neon and
the fake New York skyline, their messages in black marker beside
dozens of fire department insignias.</LD>
<LD>   "Your sacrifice, your courage, brought our nation together," read
an inscription from a retired Chicago firefighter. Another shirt
proclaimed, "Canadian firefighters will never forget 9-11."</LD>
<LD>   The fence in front of the New York-New York Hotel &amp; Casino became
an impromptu shrine of flowers, flags and handwritten notes in the
weeks after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center.
Now, as the wilting flowers and rain-soaked paper messages are
cleared away, this busy corner of the Strip is becoming a larger,
more lasting memorial.</LD>
<TE>   More than 60 T-shirts from fire departments across North America
were hanging on the fence last month. Firefighters on personal trips
are leaving some of the shirts; others are being mailed from across
the country.</TE>
<TE>   Hotel staffers were surprised several weeks ago when T-shirts
began to arrive by mail, addressed simply to the New York-New York
hotel. The display was removed for New Year's Eve and was to be
remounted last week.</TE>
<TE>   "We really didn't quite know how to react when people started to
do it, but it was obviously a spontaneous public reaction, and it was
very positive," said Micah Richins, vice president of hotel
operations.</TE>

<LD>Catalina Express has dropped its fuel surcharge of $1 each way on
boat trips between Santa Catalina Island and the Long Beach and San
Pedro harbors. Adult round-trip fares cost $40. It also cut the
surcharge from $1 to 50 cents each way on trips between the island
and Dana Point. The charges began in 2000.... France's TGV train
between Paris and Marseilles, which debuted June 10 as the fastest
long-distance train in the world, now carries 60% of the rail and air
traffic total on the route, up from 40% carried by the former
conventional (slower) line, Rail Europe says. The train makes the
537-mile trip in about three hours; planes take about 11/2 hours....
The Northwest Museum of Arts &amp; Culture in Spokane, Wash., has more

<HD>QE2 Renews Package With Concorde Jet</HD>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Cunard is renewing a package that lets passengers cruise across the
Atlantic on the Queen Elizabeth 2 liner and return on the Concorde
supersonic jet.</LD>
<LD>   In November, British Airways returned the Concorde to service
after a 15-month hiatus that followed a Concorde crash that killed
113 near Paris. Air France, which flies the jet between New York's
JFK airport and Paris, also renewed flights that month. The airlines
said they had installed more durable tires and fuel tank liners to
avoid a repeat of the crash.</LD>
<LD>   Cunard said it is the largest purchaser of Concorde seats on the
London-to-New York route. Package prices start at $3,344 per person,
double occupancy, for the six-day cruise between New York and
Southampton, England, plus a return trip on the Concorde--which is
less than the regular round-trip fare on the Concorde announced in
November. Contact a travel agent, call (800) 728-6273 or visit
www.cunard.com.</LD>
<TE>   St.-Louis based tour operator Intrav also is offering a tour that
includes a Concorde flight from New York to Paris, four nights in
Paris, travel by way of the Channel Tunnel to London, three nights in
London and a nonsupersonic flight back. Prices start at $6,995 per
person, double occupancy. Contact a travel agent or Intrav, (800)
456-8100, www.intrav.com.</TE>

<HD>Dining for (Fewer) Dollars in San Francisco</HD>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Picking up on an idea pioneered by New York City tourism boosters,
San Francisco is holding a "Dine About Town 2002" program in which
upscale restaurants will offer three-course fixed-priced menus for
$19.95 at lunch and $29.95 for dinner. (Taxes, tip and beverage are
extra.) The program runs Jan. 13 to 27. Reservations are recommended.</LD>
<LD>   As of last week, about 100 restaurants were participating. Some
were offering the deal only at lunch, others at dinner. Savings can
be substantial, depending on the restaurant. Several, such as Azie,
Campton Place, Farallon, Hawthorne Lane and Postrio, typically charge
more than $50 a person for meals, according to Zagat Survey. For a
list of the participating restaurants, call (415) 283-0177 or visit
www.sfdineabouttown.com or www.sfvisitor.org.</LD>
<LD>   "People aren't dining out as much as last year," said Laurie
Armstrong, spokeswoman for the San Francisco Convention &amp; Visitors
Bureau, a co-sponsor of Dine About Town. With business travel down,
the city hopes to encourage leisure travelers to try "upper-end"
restaurants frequented by business diners, she explained.</LD>
<TE>   The New York Convention &amp; Visitors Bureau for years has organized
a similar event in the summer called Restaurant Week, involving more
than 100 establishments. Early last year it also held one in the
winter, offering fixed-price lunches for $20.</TE>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>W New York Times Square, which rises 52 stories above the once-seedy
area that has been dramatically upgraded in the last decade, opened
Dec. 27. It is the first major hotel to debut in New York City since
the Sept. 11 attacks, its owners say.</LD>
<LD>   The hotel, at 1567 Broadway, has 509 rooms and a modern,
Asian-themed decor centered on a glass-encased waterfall and
6,000-square-foot promenade. Below ground is another Whiskey bar by
Los Angeles and New York entrepreneur Rande Gerber, who earlier last
month opened a Whiskey Sky bar and nightclub at the new Green Valley
Ranch casino-resort near Las Vegas. The bar at W New York Times
Square, called simply the Whiskey, includes a screening room and
floor tiles that change color on contact.</LD>
<LD>   The hotel's restaurant, the Blue Fin, is run by the same company
that operates the Atlantic Grill and Blue Water Grill seafood
restaurants in New York. This one seats 350 and has a raw bar and
live jazz. Room rates begin at $299. (877) 946-8357, www.whotels.com.</LD>
<TE>   The W New York Times Square is the fifth W in New York and the
16th opened worldwide by the fast-growing chain, which opened its
first hotel, W New York at 541 Lexington Ave., in December 1998. The
chain is part of Starwood Hotels &amp; Resorts Worldwide.</TE>

<HD>San Francisco, in Full Swing</HD>
<DH>In trapeze class, a novice learns to fly with a little
'Hep!' from her friends.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LISA MARLOWE</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>SAN FRANCISCO</DL>
<LD>At 10 on a crisp Saturday morning, my sister Connie and I stood in
our woolly socks in a cavernous former high school gym and gazed up.
A silver-haired 64-year-old retired college professor in a turquoise
leotard had just climbed a skinny steel ladder to a 30-foot-high
ledge.</LD>
<LD>   Eyes focused ahead and legs slightly bent, she grasped a
gauze-covered bar with both hands. On the command of "Hep!" she swung
out with a graceful arch, kicked her legs back, then brought her feet
up and hung by the knees upside down, flying back and forth before
dropping to the net below.</LD>
<LD>   Forget skydiving, bungee jumping or hang gliding. This was the
thrill I sought: the flying trapeze. This was the realm of the young
at heart, a place of levity and joy--sentiments that have been all
too elusive for many of us in recent months. When Connie and I walked
through the door of the San Francisco School of Circus Arts that
morning and read the sign, "Do Not Ride Your Unicycle in the
Basement," we knew we were in the right place.</LD>
<TE>   As a girl, I found nirvana high in the treetops, hanging by my
knees. I never outgrew that yearning. A circus-themed weekend in
August, centered on the San Francisco trapeze classes, let me fulfill
a lifelong dream while letting go of stresses and sending my spirits
soaring.</TE>
<TE>   The adventure began on a Friday when I flew to Oakland to meet my
sister, who lives in the Bay Area. We drove to San Francisco and
checked into the monolithic Hyatt Regency at Embarcadero Center ($139
per night plus tax, though rates have since dropped on some
weekends).</TE>
<TE>   Wired about the next day's trapeze lesson, we skipped a fancy
dinner and channeled our energy into a walk through the lively North
Beach neighborhood. At Caffe Trieste we stopped for cafe crema and
authentic Roman tomato focaccia, then watched a parade of
leather-clad hipsters bop down the boulevard before we called it a
night.</TE>
<TE>   Harvard philosophy professor and author Sam Keen, an ardent flier
who first learned trapeze arts at age 62 at the San Francisco circus
school, has written about "the aerial instinct--the drive to soar
above our present condition." It's the defining characteristic of
being human, he says.</TE>
<TE>   School founder Stephan Gaudreau shares the philosophy. The trapeze
is a metaphor for risk, for overcoming self-imposed limits, he says.
Some students use classes as a way of conquering midlife crises,
shyness or phobias.</TE>
<TE>   Many of the teachers are current or former members of Cirque du
Soleil, Ringling Bros. and other top shows. The school also develops
talents for its own professional troupe, the New Pickle Circus, which
practices and performs in the same space. Classes are offered in
clowning, stage combat, Chinese acrobatics and other arts. The most
popular by far is the flying trapeze.</TE>
<TE>   The beginners' class is open to everyone and has no physical
requirements. Surprisingly, upper body strength matters little. By
the end of the 90-minute lesson, students should be able to perform a
blind, upside-down flight into the arms of an instructor on a facing
trapeze. Classes are limited to six and emphasize personal attention,
so even the klutzy students can learn to fly.</TE>
<TE>   Inside the gym we found an air of privilege, as if we had been
admitted to a rarefied (albeit eclectic) club, one that included a
kindergarten teacher, a waitress, a physical therapist and a
stockbroker. After we had practiced with instructor Scott Cameron on
what is called a static trapeze on the ground, Connie and I were
eager for flight.</TE>
<TE>   She ascended to the platform first, where a lithe instructor named
Eric Vuillemey attached safety lines to her belt and assisted with
takeoff. (The lines, held by another instructor on the ground,
resemble the belaying ropes used in rock climbing.) In the air--as
when earthbound--Connie demonstrated a dexterity that put me to shame
when my turn came.</TE>
<TE>   At the top of the platform, I grasped the bar. Then everything
happened as if I were in a trance. With Eric's loud "Hep!" I swung
out. The whoosh of air in my ears seemed to whisper "welcome." With
the deepest pleasure, I was flying.</TE>
<TE>   Timing was essential. My takeoff and back arch got better after a
few tries. I managed to curl up my feet for the knee hang with ease,
and it took only two tries to perfect my upside-down drop.</TE>
<TE>   But when instructor Jennings McCown climbed hand over hand up the
rope, wrapped his Superman legs around his trapeze and began to arc
toward me with outstretched arms, my concentration took a nosedive.</TE>
<TE>   He called "Hep!" That was my cue to take off from the opposing
platform, hang upside-down and meet him midway, where he would grasp
my wrists and I would let go of my bar. This was the idea, anyway.</TE>
<TE>   The first two attempts, I was late; our movements wouldn't
synchronize. Third try, we touched hands, but my knees would not
cooperate. I was too scared to let go.</TE>
<TE>   The connection trapeze artists make is as much mental as physical.
I stood on the platform, took a deep breath and reminded myself I had
to trust Jennings. On my last try, I got the timing
right--barely--and released into his arms.</TE>
<TE>   Connie and I were still giddy after class. We changed clothes at
the hotel and strolled over to--where else?--the Original Clown Alley
on Columbus Avenue for sloppy Clown Burgers and strawberry shakes.
After 40 years, this joint is still popular with lawyers and bankers
from the Financial District. Former owner Enrico Banducci, inspired
by the clientele, named the restaurant for the under-the-grandstand
area of the circus where clowns gather before entering the ring.</TE>
<TE>   After lunch we detoured along the waterfront, where a dazzling
white tent with streaming flags caught my eye. This was Teatro
Zinzanni, billed as "Love, Chaos and Dinner." Translation: a
dinner-theater spectacle of circus acrobats, illusionists, musicians
and other performers. Held in one of the few remaining handcrafted
traveling tents from 1920s Europe, the show is Moulin Rouge in style.
A five-course meal is included in the hefty price, which starts at
$99.</TE>
<TE>   It would have been an ideal cap to the day. Alas, the show was
booked for a corporate affair that night. But next time, next time.
(Connie has since seen the show and thought the performers were
interesting and the setting much more intimate than she expected.)</TE>
<TE>   We spent the rest of Saturday afternoon at the Musee Mecanique,
our curiosity having been tweaked by a description in the guidebook
"San Francisco Bizarro." Hidden in the basement of the tourist-trap
Cliff House restaurant on Point Lobos Avenue, this privately owned
museum houses one of the world's largest collections of working
antique arcade games: 140 in all, 25 cents a pop each. They ranged
from the hilarious (the How Hot Are You? Love-o-Meter) to the
grotesque (the French Guillotine, featuring a mechanized
executioner).</TE>
<TE>   After watching chattering kids go mute at the sight of Laughing
Sal, a towering, gap-toothed doll that greets visitors at the door
with maniacal cackles, we looked over the ruins of Playland at the
Beach. Powerful waves washed over the once-lively 1914 amusement park
where many of the machines were originally installed.</TE>
<TE>   A Vietnamese dinner followed at venerable Thanh Long, my sister's
favorite San Francisco restaurant, where the "secret-recipe" garlic
noodles and roasted crab were fantastic. Opened in 1971, Thanh Long
is the more casual predecessor of the chic Crustacean restaurants in
Beverly Hills and San Francisco, all still owned and operated by
three generations of An family women. Without a reservation, we
waited 30 minutes, but it was worth it. Just the thought of those
noodles still makes my mouth water.</TE>
<TE>   Sunday morning, Connie and I grabbed a bench at Red's Java House,
a funky Embarcadero landmark crowded with construction workers,
sailors and J. Crew prepsters. A good cuppa joe and sugar
doughnuts--real sinkers--opened our bleary eyes.</TE>
<TE>   Before my plane, we drove a few minutes south on Interstate 280 to
the rolling hills of Colma and a curious monument at Olivet Memorial
Park cemetery. Erected in 1945 by Showfolks of America, a national
organization of circus performers, a memorial salutes big-top
professionals "so that they might rest in peace among their own."</TE>
<TE>   The marker is hard to miss: Amid shady manicured grounds, a
smiling, bright yellow clown points to the resting place of Swacko,
Bunny Bunting and dozens of other troupers.</TE>
<TE>   At the airport I mused about our aerial escapades. Most important
wasn't the trapeze trick we accomplished but what grew within us
during flight: a little more faith in others, a little more trust in
ourselves. And keeping a smile on my face was the golden rule of
circus school: Do not ride your unicycle in the basement.</TE>

<LD>Whether you are playing cards, reading, listening to music or simply
waking up, the following new products make the process a little more
entertaining. Items may be available in area stores. Prices do not
include shipping.</LD>
<LD>   Chime time: In these stressful times, it's nice to have an alarm
clock that is a little less alarming. The Travel Zen Alarm Clock
wakes you not with a buzzer or even music but with a series of soft
bell-like chimes. When the clock's alarm is triggered, a chime is
struck from inside the wood case. The clock also can be programmed to
chime repeatedly at any set interval, making it a neat companion for
yoga practitioners.</LD>
<LD>   The 71/2-inch-long by 21/2- inch-high by 21/4-inch-deep case has a
lighted digital display. The clock runs on two AA batteries or an AC
adapter.</LD>
<TE>   Travel Zen Alarm Clock (item 4458) is $89.95 from Now &amp; Zen; (800)
779-6383, www.now-zen.com.</TE>
<TE>   Novel spelling aid: So there you are reading the masterpiece of
the year with no dictionary at hand, and you come across a word you
don't understand. Now there's a dictionary right in your bookmark.</TE>
<TE>   Measuring 53/8 inches high by 33/16 inches wide by 5/8of an inch
deep, the 50,000-word Bookmark Dictionary operates on a lithium
battery. Type a word on the little keypad, and a definition for all
but the most esoteric term appears. The bookmark also has an alarm
clock and a calculator function.</TE>
<TE>   Bookmark Dictionary is $40 from Zelco; (800) 431-2486,
www.zelco.com.</TE>
<TE>   Carry a tune: Dislike carrying your portable cassette or CD player
in your hand while walking or jogging? Now you don't have to. The
Music Belt is an adjustable neoprene waist belt that accommodates
most portable CD, MP3 and cassette players.</TE>
<TE>   It has two extra zippered pockets for keys, earphones or cash. The
light carrier has the added advantage of cushioning your gear in
transit.</TE>
<TE>   Music Belt (44111) is $25 from TD Innovations; (888) 888-3322,
www.tdnov8.com.</TE>
<TE>   Card sharp: You never know when a deck of cards will come in
handy, and these High Visibility Playing Cards will be especially
welcome to folks with vision problems.</TE>
<TE>   The brightly colored numbers and symbols on the poker-size cards
are extra bold with strong contrast, and each suit is additionally
identified on the face by its initial letter ("H" for hearts, for
example). Picture cards (aces, jokers, jacks, queens and kings) have
the names spelled out.</TE>
<TE>   High Visibility Playing Cards are $6 for two decks from ASF
Associates; (800) 771-3600, www.readinglight.com.</TE>
<TE>   Stereo to go: The Sharper Image is continually tinkering with its
innovative travel alarm clocks, adding new features to give users
more options for waking to peaceful sounds. The latest model has a
built-in CD player, stereo AM/FM radio with TV band, and a choice of
20 digitally recorded relaxing sounds: thunderstorms, a crackling
fire, waterfalls, chirping birds, even city traffic, for those
soothed by the honks and screeches of urban life.</TE>
<TE>   You can awake to a preselected CD track, the radio, a buzzer,
church bells or one of the "soother" sounds. The LCD screen displays
the time, date and room temperature.</TE>
<TE>   Press the "Talk" button, and a pleasant voice will announce the
time. The 9-inch by 6-inch by 2-inch clock weighs 2 pounds and comes
with stereo ear buds. It runs on six AA batteries or an AC adapter.</TE>
<TE>   Portable CD Radio/Alarm Clock with Sound Soother (SI687) is
$219.95 from the Sharper Image; (800) 344-4444, www.sharperimage.com.</TE>

<HD>Air Tickets' Base Price Is Just Part of the Fare</HD>
<DH>Government and airports are piling on taxes and fees so
consumers shoulder the cost of better security and facilities.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JANE ENGLE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Have you looked at the corner of an airline ticket recently, where
the fare, fees and taxes appear to be listed? I have, and most of it
was indecipherable to me.</LD>
<LD>   One thing I do know: A new fee soon will appear, a "security
service fee" of up to $10 per round trip.</LD>
<LD>   Congress authorized it in November to pay for aviation security
improvements in the aftermath of the Sept. 11 attacks, and it is
expected to begin next month.</LD>
<TE>   So it seems like a good time to look at the taxes and fees that
the federal government and the airports load onto our airline tickets
to pay for airport building projects, FAA operations and more.</TE>
<TE>   So much more.</TE>
<TE>   "Ultimately it's the passenger who pays for everything in this
[aviation] system," says Stephen Van Beek, senior vice president for
policy at Airports Council International-North America.</TE>
<TE>   Let's start by deciphering the codes on a round-trip ticket that I
priced Dec. 26 for travel Feb. 9 to 15 from LAX to Albuquerque, with
a connection in Phoenix.</TE>
<TE>   Here's what it shows, followed by "translations" from the Federal
Aviation Administration and other experts. (The order of these
listings may vary according to the issuer and whether it's a paper
ticket or an e-ticket receipt, but the codes are generally the same.)</TE>
<TE>   * USD 133.03: Base fare--the ticket price before taxes and fees.</TE>
<TE>   * US 9.97: Domestic passenger ticket tax.</TE>
<TE>   * XT 24.00: Total of domestic flight segment fees plus passenger
facility charges.</TE>
<TE>   * USD 167.00: Total ticket price including taxes and fees.</TE>
<TE>   The fare listed in big type in airline advertisements is generally
the total of the base fare (often only one way) and the domestic
passenger ticket tax. Smaller type at the bottom lists the other
taxes.</TE>
<TE>   The new security service fee would bump this ticket's price by
$10, for a total of $43.97 worth of taxes and fees, the equivalent of
33% of the $133.03 base fare.</TE>
<TE>   Did I mention that some passenger facility charges also may be
increasing as a result of congressional action? (More on that later.)</TE>
<TE>   And that's just the breakdown on a domestic ticket.</TE>
<TE>   "We think there are about 1,700 variations of 760 taxes that can
go on an airline ticket around the world," says Howard Goldberg,
director of taxation and insurance for the International Air
Transport Assn., or IATA, in Montreal.</TE>
<TE>   He doesn't know the exact number, he says, because "we get two or
three new fees every day."</TE>
<TE>   IATA maintains a list of categories, by nation and territory, of
taxes and fees on airline tickets, last updated in February. Among
the more colorful entries: a "tourist development tax" (Benin, in
Africa), "consumption tax" (Japan), "alien head tax" (Philippines)
and my favorite, "Great Man-Made River Tax" (Libya).</TE>
<TE>   Since Sept. 11, some airlines, mostly in less developed nations,
have added "war risk surcharges" to pay for higher insurance
premiums, Goldberg says.</TE>
<TE>   Just be glad you don't live in the Netherlands. As of February,
the U.S. allowed seven types of taxes and fees on airline tickets
(some only on international tickets). The Netherlands slapped on 11
kinds, including "security taxes" and "noise isolation charges," the
most taxes of any nation or territory on the IATA list.</TE>
<TE>   Here is what U.S. taxes and fees are used for, according to the
FAA:</TE>
<TE>   * Domestic passenger ticket tax. This goes into the government's
Aviation Trust Fund, which finances FAA operations. Since 1997 this
congressionally mandated tax has been reduced from 10% of the base
fare (the ticket price before taxes) to 7.5%, where it is to remain
until 2007, says FAA spokesman William Shumann.</TE>
<TE>   * Domestic flight segment fee. (This may be coded separately on
your ticket as ZP or be listed as "federal excise tax" in airline
advertisements.) This tax, which was first imposed in 1997, also goes
into the Aviation Trust Fund. But instead of falling like the
domestic passenger ticket tax, it has been increasing.</TE>
<TE>   At first it was $1 per "segment," or leg, of the flight. (A round
trip with one stopover each way has four segments; a nonstop round
trip has two segments.) By 2001 it had increased to $2.75 per
segment, and on Jan. 1 it went to $3.</TE>
<TE>   From now on, increases are supposed to be linked to the Consumer
Price Index, Shumann says.</TE>
<TE>   * Passenger facility charge, or PFC. (This may be coded separately
on your ticket as XF or be listed as "local airport charge" in
airline ads.) This is imposed by U.S. airports, subject to approval
by the FAA, and is collected on their behalf by airlines.</TE>
<TE>   The FAA regulates how the money can be used, generally for
infrastructure such as safety improvements or noise reduction.</TE>
<TE>   The charge, first authorized in 1990, was capped at $3 per
airport, generally assessed each time a passenger departs. In April
the cap was increased to $4.50, and many airports wasted little time
in reaching it.</TE>
<TE>   By the end of October more than 90 had been approved for $4.50,
according to the Airports Council International. (Some don't actually
begin charging that rate until this year.)</TE>
<TE>   Expect more $4.50 charges to be approved soon, thanks to the Sept.
11 attacks.</TE>
<TE>   The Aviation and Transportation Security Act passed by Congress in
November calls on the FAA to expedite the airports' applications for
the charge to pay for added security.</TE>
<TE>   You can find the per-airport PFC charge on your ticket, but it's
not obvious. In the example above, it appears at the end of a long
block of letters and numbers as XFLAX3 PHX3ABQ3PHX3. The XF is the
code for the tax, followed by the airport (also in code, i.e., LAX
for Los Angeles International Airport, PHX for Phoenix, ABQ for
Albuquerque) and the amount (in this case, $3 at each airport).</TE>
<TE>   * Security service fee. This new fee, part of November's Aviation
and Transportation Security Act, will start appearing Feb. 1 on
airline tickets, according to the DOT. The fee is $2.50 per segment,
with a maximum of $5 allowed one way or $10 round trip. It goes to
the newly created Transportation Security Administration within the
Department of Transportation to finance airport security.</TE>
<TE>   This year airline passengers can expect other costs to increase
too. One problem, experts say, is that airlines lost billions after
Sept. 11 and, on top of that, are implementing costly new security
measures. The travel slump and increased security expenses also cost
U.S. airports $3 billion to $4 billion after Sept. 11, Van Beek of
the Airports Council International estimates.</TE>
<TE>   "We're in a big hole," he says, predicting that numerous airports
will try to raise various fees. One option is to increase landing
fees, which airports charge airlines. Because they increase the cost
of doing business, such charges are often passed on to the consumer.</TE>
<TE>   In December, Los Angeles airport commissioners considered, then
put on hold, a proposal to raise parking fees in LAX's central
terminal from $24 to $35 a day.</TE>

<HD>Seattle Still Rocks</HD>
<DH>Despite recent setbacks, the city remains a hip urban
playground, loaded with vibrant cultural attractions and surrounded
by glorious natural scenery.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAMES T. YENCKEL</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>SEATTLE</DL>
<LD>A city of youthful vigor, Seattle never fails to put a bounce in my
step. Sure, the place has suffered hits: a magnitude 6.8 earthquake,
the dot-com bust, the departure of Boeing aircraft,
anti-globalization riots. But none of this--at least that I could
detect--seems to have shaken its self-reliant spirit, perhaps a
heritage of its not-so-distant pioneer past. I returned recently for
a long weekend, and the mood seemed as upbeat and full of fun as
ever.</LD>
<LD>   I'm an urban dweller, and I love big cities. I keep coming back to
Seattle for its unique blend of cultural riches and rugged
outdoorsiness. As hip as any American metropolis, it reaps the good
fortune of a near-wilderness setting, blessed by both a beautiful
seascape and snow-tipped mountain ranges east and west. Gleaming
skyscrapers soar above its busy streets, but the views from almost
anywhere are so magnificent that I keep thinking I'm in a national
park.</LD>
<TE>   Its residents must feel the same way. Seattle's uniform, most days
of the year, is the parka, the kind experienced hikers don for
mountain treks. I wore mine, as did (or so it seemed) every other
person I saw. Guidebook writers have called Seattle "a base camp for
outdoor recreationists," a jumping-off place for sea and mountain
adventures, which perhaps accounts for the prevailing attire. Note,
too, that North Face, Eddie Bauer, REI and Patagonia all operate
cavernous outdoor-wear marts here.</TE>
<TE>   One city center shop called Coldwater Creek, at 1511 5th Ave., has
managed to bring the outdoors in. Meandering across the floor from
one end to the other is a rushing stream (covered by clear plastic to
prevent customers from falling in). It bubbles up from below like a
fresh spring, and at the end of its course it spills back through the
floor, forming a splashing waterfall for shoppers on the basement
level. It's a happy little boost--Mother Nature style--to anyone's
mood.</TE>
<TE>   I walk in a national park, so I walk in Seattle, a compact city
that rewards those who explore on foot. Like San Francisco, the city
is draped across high hills that here drop steeply down to the
waterfront on Elliott Bay and Puget Sound beyond. On the far shore,
the 7,000-foot peaks of the Olympic Mountains thrust above the
clouds. In the forefront, ferries scurry in and out of the bay, and
behind them oceangoing freighters rest at anchor.</TE>
<TE>   The hills add challenge to any sightseeing outing. I tackled them
as I would any mountain trail--slowly and steadily. The air here has
a crispness to it, a mix of tangy sea and icy mountain, that
encourages activity. Not too hot in the summer. Not too cold in the
winter. (Snow is infrequent.) True, overcast days are common; the sky
dripped part of every day of my October stay. Parka-clad, I ignored
the drizzle like almost everyone else and continued walking.</TE>
<TE>   My wife, Sandy, was sent here to moderate a panel of insurance
executives reflecting on the terrorist events of Sept. 11. I was
eager to keep her company on our first post-tragedy flight and to
help her check out some of the innovative restaurants earning rave
reviews in the food magazines to which she subscribes.</TE>
<TE>   For four nights we dined exquisitely on Northwest-style seafood.
Interestingly, despite the terrorism-caused drop-off in business and
leisure traffic, each of the restaurants was packed. My favorite was
Etta's Seafood, where decor, clientele and menu are contemporary.
Sandy ordered the black sea bass, served with fingerling potatoes and
a four-mushroom sauce ($25). I went for the baked ling cod on a bed
of savoy cabbage and lentils ($21). For dessert we shared a slice of
cranberry upside-down cake, made with newly harvested Washington
state berries and topped with white chocolate ice cream and an orange
sauce ($7).</TE>
<TE>   I also was eager to see the dramatic new Frank Gehry-designed
building housing the city's rock 'n' roll museum, which opened in
June 2000 as the Experience Music Project. It celebrates rock icon
Jimi Hendrix, a Seattle native, and grunge, another local phenomenon.
The museum, built by Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen, sprawls at the
foot of the soaring Space Needle. When I asked for directions, a
street vendor pointed toward the Needle and told me to look for "the
big blue blob beneath." Uh-oh, somebody was not happy with Gehry's
work. Would I be?</TE>
<TE>   As I discovered on earlier trips, the city has become a center for
fine handcrafts of all kinds--contemporary pieces by local artisans,
traditional Northwest Native American woodcarvings and international
folk art--displayed in a profusion of galleries. This is the sort of
art that interests me most, so gallery gazing was high on my list of
activities while Sandy attended her meetings.</TE>
<TE>   What I hadn't realized until I started exploring is that art glass
has become Seattle's latest crafts craze. The city reputedly ranks
second only to Venice, Italy, in its number of glass-blowing studios.
Block after block, galleries filled with colorful abstract glass
creations form a sort of extended museum. One must-see shop is the
Glasshouse Studio, which doubles as a glass-blowing workshop. Another
was the Foster/White Gallery, which displays the work of Dale
Chihuly, the city's leading glass artist. Both are in historic
Pioneer Square in a cluster of galleries.</TE>
<TE>   The first all-glass artwork to catch my eye was a cylindrical
tower of scrambled tubes in a vibrant rainbow of hues. It dominates
the lobby of the Alexis, the boutique hotel we first enjoyed on a
prior trip. While Sandy registered us, I circled the glass tower, a
bit baffled but delighted by the odd, whimsical beauty of the giant
sculpture. Before the day was out, I learned it was created by
Tacoma-born Chihuly, who is credited with inaugurating Seattle's love
affair with glass when he opened a glass-art school in 1971. Down the
street, Chihuly's spectacular cascading chandeliers, two 25-foot
sculptures all in white, adorn Benaroya Hall, home of the Seattle
Symphony.</TE>
<TE>   Complementing the city's creative spirit is its support of the
performing arts. Local officials claim the Puget Sound region ranks
third in the nation in its number of professional theaters, behind
New York and Chicago. When I was here, the hot ticket was an
acclaimed production of "Macbeth" by the Seattle Shakespeare Company.
Night owls might want to catch the popular Market Theater at Pike
Place Market, which features improvisational comedy. The Seattle
Opera is one of only a few opera companies that produce Richard
Wagner's complete "Ring of the Nibelungen," a part of its annual
summer season.</TE>
<TE>   And Seattle knows, and enjoys, the little pleasures of life. Years
ago, on a first visit, I was amazed at the number of espresso bars
and fine pastry shops. Even department stores featured sidewalk
coffee bars in front of their display windows, a charmingly civilized
gesture, I thought at the time. I still do, even though Seattle by
now has dispatched its coffee culture to seemingly every corner of
the country.</TE>
<TE>   Municipal overseers who decide these things have rated Seattle as
one of America's most livable cities, and I don't doubt it. Take a
stroll up Broadway toward the Capitol Hill neighborhood (a misnomer,
since Olympia, not Seattle, became the state capital). It's an
interesting mix of ethnic cafes, cozy pubs, delis, bookstores and
boutiques in an area of fine homes. But as you approach East Harrison
Street, keep your eyes on the sidewalk. Embedded in the pavement, as
quirky works of art, are bronze dance-step charts. Place your feet
over the footsteps, hum a proper tune and you will be dancing in the
streets. On the west side of Broadway it's the mambo; on the east, a
foxtrot. A city indulging in whimsy like this is a livable city.</TE>
<TE>   Seattle's first settlers, numbering 22, arrived in 1851 by coastal
schooner from Portland, Ore. Acquiring land from friendly Puget Sound
Indian tribes (whose chief, Seathl, gave Seattle its name), the early
entrepreneurs established a flourishing lumber trade, selling to a
rapidly growing San Francisco.</TE>
<TE>   A wood pathway down which fallen trees were skidded from hilltop
forest to sawmill became what is thought to be the original "Skid
Road," a name later corrupted to "Skid Row" when the neighborhood
went on the skids. Gallery-dotted Yesler Way in Pioneer Square
approximates the original log slide.</TE>
<TE>   The Klondike gold rush of 1897-98, sparked by the arrival in port
of a ship carrying a legendary "ton of gold," gave Seattle its first
big boost. Thousands of gold seekers poured into the frontier town to
be outfitted for the trip north to Skagway, Alaska, and onward to the
Yukon Territory in Canada. The story is well told in Pioneer Square's
Klondike Gold Rush National Park, a small museum presenting "Dreams
of Gold," a thoughtful film detailing the event.</TE>
<TE>   Seattle thrust itself again into national attention when it staged
the successful World's Fair of 1962, which bequeathed the city the
607-foot-high Space Needle. The fair is also credited with spurring
action to rescue the business center from the decline that afflicted
many American cites. Today the downtown, a cluster of upscale
department stores and malls around Pine Street and 5th Avenue, ranks
as one of the country's most exciting urban shopping complexes. In a
compact area, shoppers have a choice of department stores--Nordstrom,
the Bon Marche, Barneys--plus a large supporting cast of trendy
boutiques, chain clothing stores, galleries and cafes. All are
invitingly displayed in a couple of atrium malls rising above
tree-lined streets and squares adorned with fountains and outdoor
artworks.</TE>
<TE>   After our midday arrival, Sandy had the rest of the afternoon off.
So we set off quickly--on foot, of course--to see some of the
highlights she would otherwise miss. For four days we walked
everywhere, day and night. As the tourist, I found plenty of good
restaurants, shops, museums and other attractions to keep me
entertained within comfortable walking distance of the Alexis and
most other major downtown hotels. The Legacy, a first-rate gallery of
local Native American art, is next door to the Alexis.</TE>
<TE>   First stop for us was Pike Place Market. Sprawling, crowded,
friendly and aromatic, it is a welcome relic from a less packaged
age. Roughly two square blocks in size, it is packed with stalls
selling fresh fish, produce and flowers, as well as inexpensive
crafts. Street musicians serenade with Mozart airs, and out front a
life-sized bronze pig, called Rachel, is a sample of Seattle's rich
trove of public art.</TE>
<TE>   On the way to the rock museum, we first took a quick look inside
the neighboring Pacific Science Center (adults $8). Sandy enjoyed the
Tropical Butterfly House; I got a kick out of playing a video soccer
game in which I jumped, darted and crouched to defend my goal. Kids
seemed fascinated by the giant tic-tac-toe game. The X's and O's are
so heavy that they have to be moved by a giant robotic arm. Each
player gets a lever to operate the device.</TE>
<TE>   In contrast to the Science Center's hands-on fun, the rock music
exhibits at the Experience Music Project (adults $19.95; discounts
for seniors, military and children) seemed tedious, and I sort of
slogged through Seattle's rock heritage halfheartedly. Dim lighting,
small, tightly packed rooms and ear-blasting sound effects eventually
proved too claustrophobic, and we escaped back to the welcome
outdoors. As for architect Gehry's free-flowing metallic structure--a
multicolored, yes, "blob" of swirls and whirls--I have my doubts.
Though his abstract museum designs win raves in the architecture
world and I'm open to the new and unusual, this one already seems
outdated and tacky.</TE>
<TE>   We hurried off to dinner at Etta's, which rescued us from this
modest disappointment</TE>
<TE>   On subsequent days I roamed on foot alone from museum to gallery
to offbeat neighborhood. At the Seattle Art Museum ($5) I got a
lesson in the Native American art of the Northwest Coast. On display
were historic hand-carved wood totem poles, masks and canoes. The
most curious object was an 1880s ermine hide shirt, made of 100 skins
and once worn by a Tlingit Indian named Chilkoot Jack. On the
waterfront, the Seattle Aquarium ($9) features Pacific Northwest sea
life, including an adorable community of sea otters performing a
playful underwater ballet.</TE>
<TE>   In the International District I wandered the aisles of Uwajimaya,
a massive Japanese food market stocked with exotic Asian vegetables.
On the way to Capitol Hill I paused at REI's flagship store (222 Yale
Ave. N.), dubbed the "Disneyland of outdoor gear" by local folks.
There I watched climbers inching to the top of one of the world's
tallest indoor climbing walls. One afternoon I browsed the shelves of
the Elliott Bay Book Co. (101 S. Main St.), a cozy bookstore with
easy chairs tucked into a dozen nooks and crannies. To escape a brief
squall, I stepped inside Fado, an Irish pub (801 1st Ave.), where a
trio of musicians played folk tunes before a warming fire.</TE>
<TE>   At the end of each day Sandy joined me for dinner. After Etta's,
we tried the Dahlia Lounge, also a favorite. We both ordered the
grilled king salmon, served with sweet-and-sour pumpkin ($24), which
proved the place hasn't lost its touch. The next night we dined on
grilled mahi-mahi with a soy and ginger butter sauce ($17.80) at the
Flying Fish. Our final night, we invited a couple of Sandy's
convention colleagues to join us at the Painted Table at the Alexis.
Here the hit dish was herb-basted salmon on a bed of roasted
artichokes ($25.50).</TE>
<TE>   The meal would have been a fine ending to a most satisfactory
visit, but one more Seattle treat awaited us. I picked up a rental
car, and we boarded a Puget Sound ferry en route to a drive down the
Washington and Oregon coasts. For four days we had admired the
Olympic Mountain views across the sound. On the Bremerton ferry, we
caught sight of the similarly thrilling Seattle skyline disappearing
in our wake.</TE>

<DH>In Guatemala, a child of the material world learns much
more than just a new tongue.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LONNAE O'NEAL PARKER</AU>
<BD>WASHINGTON POST</BD>
<DL>ANTIGUA, Guatemala</DL>
<LD>I don't know when it first occurred to me to take my 7-year-old
daughter, Sydney, to Guatemala for a month. It might have been after
the holidays, when she informed me that her friend Brittany had "a
radio and a CD player and a VCR and a TV and a telephone in her room,
and she's only 6. When can I get my own telephone, Mommy?"</LD>
<LD>   Maybe it was the cumulative effect of a year spent listening to
Sydney and her fellow first-graders measure their worth in Powerpuff
Girls and Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen and all things Barbie. Or
perhaps it was after taking a good look at the overindulged children
of my middle-class friends and thinking, "Look at these fragile
children, with their underdeveloped sense of self-reliance and
overdeveloped sense of entitlement."</LD>
<LD>   I had come here for a three-week Spanish immersion program in
1999. It was the first time I had spent a significant amount of time
abroad, and the trip seared my mind with harsh, beautiful contrasts,
scenes of panoramic beauty and grinding squalor.</LD>
<TE>   A trip to a well-traveled locale in Central America would be a
great way to teach Spanish to Sydney and to expand her frame of
reference gently, I thought. A way, I hoped, to dematerialize my
material girl.</TE>
<TE>   We touched down in Guatemala City on an early June evening, and
city lights colored the night sky. Sydney looked out the airplane
window and exclaimed loudly, "Look at all the buildings, Mommy!" Then
she looked at me accusingly and added, "You said there weren't any
buildings in Guatemala."</TE>
<TE>   I refused to make eye contact with any of the other passengers. I
had not said that, but in trying to prepare her, perhaps I had
overemphasized the whole developing-country thing. Tact was to be a
frequent casualty of our trip.</TE>
<TE>   The head of the English department at the bilingual school Sydney
would attend had taken care of the logistics. We would stay with a
family in Antigua, the destination of nearly 70% of all visitors to
Guatemala. It is an evocatively beautiful, ancient city, a place
where Spanish colonial architecture and cobblestone streets are set
against a backdrop of great, looming volcanoes. In a country scarred
by 36 years of civil war--it ended in 1996--Antigua has held fiercely
to its Old World soul while catering to a robust tourist industry.</TE>
<TE>   Syd had not been looking forward to the trip, complaining that she
would be forced to live without TV and English. Our first night, she
was tired and close to meltdown about the "clubhouse on the roof," a
small, spare one-room roof addition that was our living quarters. But
early the next morning she rushed out to play with the roosters,
which had begun crowing, impossibly, at 3 in the morning.</TE>
<TE>   "Mommy, I fed the chickens," she exclaimed. "I love it here!" She
hated-loved just about every day we spent in Guatemala.</TE>
<TE>   For $65 a week we received our room and three meals every day
except Sunday. The house was about a five-block walk from the main
gathering place, Parque Central, and its nearby banks, restaurants
and shops. Our typical colonial abode featured an uncovered indoor
patio and eight rooms of varying sizes, with the front room used as a
small tienda, a store selling toiletries, snacks and liquor. The
spare room was reserved for foreign visitors.</TE>
<TE>   I spoke limited Spanish; Senora Lorena and her husband, their two
children and the more than half-dozen extended family members who
lived with them spoke no English. But nothing focuses the mind like
having to negotiate food and bathroom issues. Everyone in the house
made concessions for our limited vocabulary except the matriarch and
family cook, Dona Olivia. At 71, the tiny, wizened woman could not be
bothered to interrupt her flow just so her foreign visitors could
translate. While Senora Lorena and her father ran the family store,
and her husband worked in the city as a security guard, Dona Oli ran
the house and cared for the foreign guests.</TE>
<TE>   She clucked, fretted and worried, grandmother-like, over Sydney's
eating, bathroom and outerwear habits.</TE>
<TE>   "Te gusta la sopa, mi amor?" she asked one day after serving a
steaming bowl of black bean soup. "Do you like the soup, my love?"</TE>
<TE>   Sydney just stared at the old woman, while I smiled and apologized
and assured the senora that the soup was fine. "Sydney, you're being
rude," I told her.</TE>
<TE>   Within a few days, Syd got with the program. Her attempts to count
in Spanish improved, and "uno, dose, crayes, tacos" turned into a
well-accented count to 10.</TE>
<TE>   "Tienes que comer, nina," the senora admonished my daughter one
day at lunch, frowning at her half-eaten plate. "You have to eat,
child."</TE>
<TE>   "Si," Sydney replied, smiling at the senora before turning to me.
"Mommy, do you like how I just say 'si'? That way the senora thinks I
know what she's talking about."</TE>
<TE>   Our days fell into a routine. We were up by 5:30 to avoid the
bathroom rush and the prospect of being mostly nude in the courtyard,
which was just off the bathroom. At breakfast, Syd and I would run
through a checklist of our day.</TE>
<TE>   Every morning, a van picked up Sydney for the trip to Colonial Bi-
lingue in old Antigua. Two afternoons a week, Sydney also had a
Spanish tutor, Senorita Brenda. But it was playing with Senora
Lorena's 7-year-old son, Andreas, that provided Sydney with most of
her substantive Spanish interaction. After lunch they would take
turns riding a bike around the courtyard and even through the dining
room. They would hit each other or play teacher or hide-and-seek or a
Latin version of tag. This went on for hours.</TE>
<TE>   At other times they would clash--not culture clash, just clash
like two willful kids who wanted the same toy. "You need to show some
home training," I would tell her when she and Andreas screamed too
loudly. "We are guests in this country." But no one else seemed to
mind the noise.</TE>
<TE>   Dinner typically was a light, meatless meal, always with corn
tortillas and beans or some kind of pepper or tomato soup. We always
cleared the table, but Dona Oli, who waited on us at each meal,
consistently waved away any further effort to help with dinner or
household chores outside our room. After dinner was a time to unwind.</TE>
<TE>   I would often sit on the bench in the courtyard, enjoying the
night breeze or reading the paper while the children played.
Sometimes someone would play the guitar, and often Syd and I would
sing, a children's song or an R&amp;B bubble-gum classic. My daughter and
I bonded over missed timing and off-key notes, but the family seemed
to appreciate our musical stylings.</TE>
<TE>   Then we would head upstairs to our room on the roof. After we
changed into our pajamas, we would each spend 20 minutes or so
writing in our journals. This was nonnegotiable, although Sydney
often complained about additional "homework." She was defiant, I was
insistent, and these were among our most trying times. I was still
waiting for some great teachable moment.</TE>
<TE>   Besides taking classes and hanging out at the house, several times
a week Syd and I walked the city, scouting places to eat and send
e-mail or taking our laundry to be washed. Most everything was a
20-minute walk from the house.</TE>
<TE>   The first time I went to the bank, I met Angela, a disheveled
indigenous girl. We were both waiting to exchange U.S. dollars for
quetzals, and I was struck by the little girl's patience as we stood
in the long line. She seemed to be Sydney's age and was alone at a
bank trying to change money. I gave her a few quetzals for reminding
me of my daughter, and she smiled before blending into the crowd.</TE>
<TE>   Here, Sydney and I were brown people in a country filled with
brown people. With my light complexion and wavy hair, I was
Everywoman--a person of color but race nonspecific. Perhaps Puerto
Rican or Panamanian or from the Dominican Republic, but most people
assumed I was Latina. That made me plural.</TE>
<TE>   But Sydney was singular, the only little negrita girl walking the
cobblestone avenues. Often when they saw her, Guatemaltecos would
call out to us. "Que linda, tu nina"--How pretty, your daughter. They
were enchanted by her eyelashes, long curly things that reach for her
brows, and by her soft, kinky, shoulder-length hair, kept in two or
three neat pigtails.</TE>
<TE>   While I was delighted at the affectionate attention she received,
Sydney acted like a movie star barely indulging her adoring public.
"Mommy, I'm tired of all those people staring because they've never
seen a brown girl like me," she would say, sticking out her lip. She
wasn't one to celebrate diversity with the locals.</TE>
<TE>   Enjoy it now, nina, I thought to myself, because little brown
girls are not always so celebrated.</TE>
<TE>   I had told Sydney that Guatemala is a poor country, much different
from the United States. But even given the general level of poverty,
there were many people living hand to mouth. Sydney began peppering
me with questions, trying to understand who they were and why.</TE>
<TE>   "Is he poor, Momma?" Sydney asked once, as we passed an indigenous
man asleep on the street. "Look at his feet," I told her. "If you see
someone who doesn't have any shoes, that usually means that he's not
doing so hot."</TE>
<TE>   Sydney looked up at me. "Are we doing so hot, Momma?" she asked,
and I felt my eyes well up with unexpected tears.</TE>
<TE>   I held Sydney's hand and we walked past stray dogs and street
people and children who would never see the inside of a school.</TE>
<TE>   "Yes, sweetheart, we're doing just fine," I told her.</TE>
<TE>   As we took touristy shots of ruins in this colonial capital, our
trip also became part history lesson, and I talked to Sydney about
racism and slavery, about Columbus and the history of colonialism in
Latin America. Besides the ruins, I took her to the ancient village
of Chichicastenango, home of the largest indigenous market in
Guatemala. It would be a leisurely way to get my souvenir shopping
done, I thought.</TE>
<TE>   I was wrong.</TE>
<TE>   There are lots of cliches about the dignity in poverty. I find
them untrue. Desperate poverty is just that--desperate. Cynical. In
search of its next meal. And every Sunday and Thursday, when
thousands of Mayan artisans display their wares in Chichicastenango,
tourists are the meal ticket.</TE>
<TE>   From the moment we stepped off the bus, we were surrounded by
women and children urging us, "Compre algo"--buy something--making it
difficult to walk. Haggling is part of the buying process in
Guatemala, but my heart wasn't in it, so I ended up paying close to
full price for most things. Little children followed Sydney, and she
began doling out her allowance and instructing me to give money to
her "friends." The volume of people and the level of need was
exhausting, overwhelming.</TE>
<TE>   We stopped for lunch and were approached even while eating. One
especially determined woman wouldn't take "No, gracias" for an
answer. She hovered around our table, saying she was thirsty and
asking me to buy her a Coke. I emptied Sydney's bottle of Coke--I was
drinking tea--into a cup. She drank it up eagerly. Sydney was near
tears.</TE>
<TE>   "Oh, honey, your mommy can buy you another Coke," some of the
other tourists told her, but Sydney would not be consoled.</TE>
<TE>   I didn't even try. Some things cannot be translated. I'm not sure
I had the words to let a 7-year-old know how bad off you must be to
beg for soda from tourists. Some things, I decided, my child would
have to process on her own.</TE>
<TE>   As we left the cafe, a small girl followed us and stood next to
our bus, staring as we took our seats. She was just a little older
than Sydney and had a toddler strapped to her back. We had already
bought something from her, but she seemed to be trying to process
something of her own. She seemed to be trying to process Sydney.</TE>
<TE>   In Chichicastenango, rich Americans were nothing new. But a rich
brown girl from the States was something else entirely. It was as if
the universe had betrayed her by the fact that such a person existed,
and I read the questions in that little girl's eyes. Why does she get
to eat? Why does she get to ride on the bus? Why doesn't she have to
sell cheap trinkets with a baby strapped to her back?</TE>
<TE>   As we drove away, I had no answers.That night Sydney wrote in her
journal:</TE>
<TE>   "When me and my mom ... were at a resterron, we saw some poor
people. They were worring my mom to deth but my mom can understand
that they really wanted money to buy some food . . . I was givving
away money to some people who did not have a lot of money and I felt
proud of my self. One girl was begging me because she wand my purple
sweater. I felt bad for that girl because she had to carry her baby
sister on her back."</TE>
<TE>   A week later, at her desk in our clubhouse, Sydney stopped in the
middle of doing homework. "Momma, I should have given that lady my
Coke," she said, nodding over and over. I just nodded back.</TE>
<TE>   My maestro, Julio Morales, has been teaching Spanish to tourists
in Antigua for 12 years. He says he's seen the number of students
double in that time. He credits this to the affordable prices and
Antigua's blend of old and new cultures. Guatemala, he says, is a
vacation for people to play but also to learn, to think.</TE>
<TE>   It was nearing the end of our trip, and Sydney and I were ready to
leave. There is a certain amount of letting go you do in Guatemala.
There is no OSHA, you can't drink the water, and it is an armed
society. Still, you feel safe, as long as you take precautions.
Common sense and strict family oversight are often substitutes for
government programs and regulations.</TE>
<TE>   I had been stoic about not having a lid on our toilet and warring
every day with flies, but I was also becoming worried. More than 70
maximum security inmates had escaped from a nearby prison, and a
countrywide state of emergency had been declared. There were
corruption scandals and a growing sense of political unrest, as well
as a daring daytime bank robbery not far from our house. I never felt
personally threatened, but I was homesick and skinny. Sydney was
flea-bitten. We were ready to go.</TE>
<TE>   We spent our last few days picking up gifts and giving away small
amounts of money, mostly to the women we passed every day. Sydney
handed it over. A few dollars went to the young woman who slept in
the doorway of the church in Calle 3. A few more to the old
indigenous woman who sat next to Cafe Condesa, who met my eye and
started to pray in some ancient Mayan dialect.</TE>
<TE>   These were gratuities, I explained to Sydney, small thanks for
allowing us to share their country. On our final day in Guatemala,
Sydney and I found Angela, the little girl I'd met in the bank. We
took her to lunch at Campero's, a McDonald's-style chicken place with
an indoor playground. I bought food for Angela's brother and gave her
some money. She seemed pleased but restrained.</TE>
<TE>   Angela and Sydney walked down the street with their arms around
each other, as all the good girlfriends in Antigua do. Angela gently
guided Sydney closer to the sidewalk, away from passing cars. I was
struck by how street-smart and aware she was. How much older she was,
at 8, than my child.</TE>
<TE>   I took a final perfect Polaroid of Sydney and Angela--my daughter
and her new friend, arm in arm. Angela, who begs money from tourists
in the streets and always saves half of her French fries for her
brother, had never had a picture of herself. Her face lit up when she
saw this one.</TE>
<TE>   "Is this for me?" she asked, and I hesitated.</TE>
<TE>   "She can have the picture, Momma," Sydney said. I smiled, fighting
back tears, for the first time seeing Angela in three dimensions and
not as some kind of prop in Sydney's big adventure.</TE>
<TE>   I did not dematerialize my material girl overnight, but I know she
will be processing the images from our trip for years to come. And
so, unexpectedly, will I.</TE>

<HD>Going Underground in Beijing</HD>
<DH>The capital's history is uncovered in subterranean tunnels
and old districts.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE MEYER</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>BEIJING</DL>
<LD>In 1969, China's leaders faced a problem familiar to Cold War
veterans: How could they shield urban populations from military
attack?</LD>
<LD>   War with the Soviet Union seemed imminent. There had been
skirmishes along the Siberian border. Diplomatic talks were
deadlocked; nuclear weapons stood ready to be launched.</LD>
<LD>   During the Cultural Revolution from 1966 to 1976, China's
Communist leaders sent the nation's youth to the countryside to
safeguard their proletarian minds from bourgeois thought. And
Chairman Mao had a plan to protect proletarian bodies from Soviet
bombs: Start digging, he said.</LD>
<TE>   In the capital, 70,000 conscripted "volunteers" dug for a decade,
creating a sinuous and unmeasured network of tunnels dubbed the
"underground Great Wall." Like the Great Wall, it has become a
tourist attraction.</TE>
<TE>   But a visit to the Underground City reveals more than what is
below the capital's bustling streets. It also showcases China's
history, which endures in the traditional alleyways that are being
turned to rubble for the 2008 Olympics.</TE>
<TE>   In 1997, after a Peace Corps stint teaching college in the Chinese
countryside, I moved to Beijing to teach and write. Graduate school
at UC Berkeley tore me away, but last summer I returned to visit my
former students.</TE>
<TE>   When they said they wanted to see something especially and
ephemerally Beijing, I got to thinking. Like most residents of the
capital, I had heard rumors of secret passageways beneath its
sidewalks. Soldiers were said to have entered Tiananmen Square from
the tunnels during the 1989 crackdown on demonstrating students.</TE>
<TE>   The capital was in the throes of another massive renovation. Its
old gray brick walls bore slogans reading either "New Beijing, Great
Olympics" or chai--knock down, raze. What should we visit before it
was renovated into oblivion?</TE>
<TE>   My old neighborhood of Haidian, in the northwest university
district, wasn't merely unrecognizable since I had visited the year
before; it was gone. And with it went ancient winding alleys, rows of
spindly locust trees, duck and dumpling restaurants, sidewalk sweet
potato vendors and grannies rolling their Rs as they chatted. In
their place stood a new ring road, high-rise apartments and reminders
of America: a McDonald's, Domino's Pizza and Starbucks.</TE>
<TE>   At Haidian Book City, the emporium serving the student population,
the best-selling titles reflected the city's balancing act between
its insulated past and its future as a new member of the World Trade
Organization. Alongside commentaries on modernizing the capital were
new guidebooks showcasing its ancient streets and way of life.</TE>
<TE>   I chose two, "Old Beijing" and "A Guidebook to Alleys in Beijing,"
which concentrate on the Qianmen neighborhood, where the entrance to
the tunnels is. It is a working-class district cluttered with beauty
salons, markets, newsstands and dozens of restaurants, sandwiched
between the Forbidden City and the Temple of Heaven on the southern
edge of Tiananmen Square. Qianmen, a warren of hutongs, narrow alleys
that front four-sided homes, has remained physically unchanged for
eight centuries. But modernization has begun to nibble at its edges,
and, thanks to the Olympic make-over, soon it will be altered
forever.</TE>
<TE>   The next day four of my students met me at the two-story Kentucky
Fried Chicken at Qianmen's edge, the area's most visible landmark
aside from Chairman Mao's blocky, hulking sarcophagus. The kids,
macabre as teens can be, wanted to see Mao's preserved body once
more. We had gone twice last summer, so I urged them to consider the
thick lines of people curving through Tiananmen Square under the
searing sun. They relented at last.</TE>
<TE>   We crossed Qianmen Avenue and stood at the head of Damochang
Alley. It's only a short, dusty distance down the alley to the
entrance to the Underground City, but the walk filled our morning.</TE>
<TE>   The deep crimson of the Forbidden City's walls and the square's
creamy vermilion monuments gave way to gray brick homes with grass
sprouting from their tiled roofs. They are among the few hutong homes
in Beijing that aren't preserved as living museums. We wound our way
past two women swatting a badminton birdie, a woman shopping in silk
pajamas and slippers, and a grandmother walking backward, urging her
infant grandson to walk toward her. He was naked except for a red bib
and tiny Nikes, and a small crowd had gathered to cheer him on.</TE>
<TE>   One student asked me if scenes like this happened in America.</TE>
<TE>   "I hope so," I replied.</TE>
<TE>   I wasn't surprised when people began inviting us to take photos.</TE>
<TE>   "This will all be torn down," one resident said. "We're not sure
when, in the next couple of years maybe. We'll be moved to new
apartments outside the Fourth Ring Road."</TE>
<TE>   Her neighbor laughed. "Then we'll have our own bathrooms!"</TE>
<TE>   Which is a point often overlooked by romantics who want to
preserve the old residences, many built as much as 100 years ago.
Although hutongs are in a state of decay that looks charming, living
in them isn't. The cramped wood homes do not have plumbing, and
residents of each block must share a pit toilet in an unheated room.</TE>
<TE>   I was most interested in the homes' peeling wood entrances,
crafted with double red mahogany doors fastened together by an
S-shaped clasp under a gateway of carved stone.</TE>
<TE>   But my students were more interested in eating than in history. We
chose a small place, Xiang Hai Canguan (Fragrant Sea Restaurant),
which advertised home-style cooking. At its steps sat a steel basin
filled with seven pig heads. Nearby, in another steel basin, a naked
baby splashed.</TE>
<TE>   Local wisdom calls for spicy food in hot weather to open the
pores, so we ate cubes of cucumber slathered in vinegar, soy sauce,
lajiao (hot red peppers) and garlic followed by bowls of cold
Korean-style wheat noodles, topped with ice, pickled soybeans and
seaweed and seasoned with sesame, cucumber slices and hot pepper.</TE>
<TE>   I opened "Old Beijing" and looked for a passage to read aloud. The
students groaned. "Let's see it, not hear about it," they pleaded.</TE>
<TE>   To get to the Beijing Underground City, visitors must descend
steep concrete stairs 30 feet into the cold, damp bedrock to walk a
small loop in a corner of the complex. Four guides at the overstaffed
entrance kiosk chatted with us in Chinese, then agreed that our group
could enter alone. They warned us not to wander into the many
unlighted tunnels because they were still unmapped and stretched for
miles into darkness. Some tourists had been lost for days, a guide
said.</TE>
<TE>   Telling this to four teenagers hopped up on lajiao and caffeine
was not a smart move.</TE>
<TE>   "Can we buy candles near here?" one asked.</TE>
<TE>   The guide frowned. "There's not enough oxygen deep in the tunnels
to allow a flame, and the smoke could choke you," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Cool. The student reluctantly offered a solution. "Do you have a
flashlight we could borrow?"</TE>
<TE>   The guide looked at me.</TE>
<TE>   "I can watch over them," I said reassuringly. Then I quoted Mao's
dying words to his successor, Hua Guofeng. It's a line that always
breaks the ice: "'I rest easy knowing you assume my duties.'
Everything will be fine."</TE>
<TE>   The guide laughed and waved us down the narrow stairs, not
noticing the flashlight I had tucked under my shirt.</TE>
<TE>   We were the only visitors below, and my first impression was the
sudden silence. Silence is the rarest commodity in bustling Beijing,
and being surrounded by it in the tunnel's clammy, chilly air was
eerie. A string of bare 40-watt bulbs dangling from the round
tunnel's cement ceiling led us to the exhibit's entrance, where the
incongruous faces of Karl Marx, Friedrich Engels, Vladimir Lenin and
Josef Stalin greeted us silently from posters. A rudimentary
introduction and a map of the areas open to tourists hung beside
them.</TE>
<TE>   The Underground City was built to shelter 300,000 people
temporarily and to move them to the outskirts of the city. Standing
at the mouth of it, only four people abreast, it was impossible to
imagine an evacuation scene. Breathing in air heavy with mildew, I
was already claustrophobic. My students and I moved tentatively
forward through narrow passageways--only slightly more than an arm's
length across but 7 feet high--past a row of Chinese characters
chiseled in red: "Prepare for war!" Myriad tunnels spilled off the
main artery, labeled with damp hand-painted signs, and some opened
into vacant rooms, seeming ghost towns that were never inhabited.
Other signs pointed the way to Tiananmen Square, the Forbidden City
and, about 40 miles north of the city, the Great Wall.</TE>
<TE>   One guide said she had been told the tunnels linked a nationwide
subterranean thoroughfare nearly 5,000 miles long. Another disagreed,
saying Beijing's circuit covered only 42 miles. Whatever its length,
the part of the Underground City open to tourists takes only half an
hour to explore.</TE>
<TE>   My students posed for photos at the mouth of the silenced cinema,
a vacant school, a barbershop and an empty arsenal. Carvings in
Socialist Realism style depicted the proletariat with raised fists
and captions like "The American Empire will be defeated!" A
ghost-white ceramic bust of Chairman Mao stared at us from a wall.</TE>
<TE>   At the mouth of an unlit tunnel, I revealed the flashlight I
carried, flipped it on and pointed it into the darkness. Excited, the
kids cracked jokes and urged me on in an attempt to reach the
Forbidden City. But after 10 disorienting minutes of creeping forward
in the inky, frigid void, they pawed at my shirt and begged to turn
back.</TE>
<TE>   We did, following a strange glow and the sound of voices to the
end of the tour route. We spilled into a large lighted room where a
dozen women sat on couches sipping tea. Seeing us, they sprang into
action, pulling cocoons from fish tanks and demonstrating how silk
floss is constructed into cozy comforters, on sale for $100. While
the cool air was good for the silkworms, it didn't seem as nourishing
to the workers, pale and padded in layers of scarves. We ascended the
stairs back to Damochang Alley.</TE>
<TE>   The sky had turned black from thunderclouds and slanting rain.
Bicycles piloted by people shrouded in ponchos sliced through
puddles, filling the air with the sound of tearing paper. Water ran
in rivulets from the tile roofs, splashing onto laughing children. My
eyes slowly adjusted to the light. The reflection of red lanterns
shimmered on the black, luminous asphalt. It was a lovely, delicate
scene, and soon it would all disappear.</TE>

<HD>Soak Up Some Precious Solitude in Chino Hills' Water Canyon</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN McKINNEY</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Water Canyon just may be the most compelling place in the Chino
Hills. Grand old oak, sycamore, willow and walnut trees shade this
quiet enclave, and the steep canyon walls add to the sense of
isolation and adventure.</LD>
<LD>   The canyon straddles the border of Orange and San Bernardino
counties, but it seems a hundred miles away from the suburban sprawl
of either place. It's particularly attractive because it is
accessible only on foot. That's a rarity in Chino Hills State Park,
whose excellent network of dirt roads often is crammed with mountain
bikers and horseback riders.</LD>
<LD>   Other times, however, few people are here. On a recent Saturday I
counted only five visitors' vehicles--this in the heart of a state
park. Perfect walking weather, not a cloud in the sky, sunny but not
hot, air quality as good as it gets. Where was everybody? I counted
more rabbits than people.</LD>
<TE>   Directions to the trail head: Chino Hills State Park can be tricky
to find. The park is west of California 71, with California 91 to the
south and California 60 to the north.</TE>
<TE>   From California 71, exit on Soquel Canyon Parkway and travel one
mile to a left turn at Elinvar Road, which bends sharply left. Look
immediately right for a signed dirt route called Bane Canyon Road.
Enter the park on this road, which becomes pavement again in two
miles. Follow signs toward the park office and ranger station.</TE>
<TE>   About a half-mile before the office, turn left into a campground
and follow the road to its end at a gate and parking area. Here you
will find the start of a connector trail to Aliso Canyon Trail and
the loop hike I'm discussing this week.</TE>
<TE>   The hike: The connector for Aliso Canyon Trail heads south across
a wide, fairly flat grassland. After about a half-mile, the dirt road
dips to cross the creek at the bottom of Aliso Canyon. Just before
the crossing, note (but do not follow) an unsigned part of upper
Aliso Canyon Trail on your right. This will be your return route.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, look for a junction ahead. To the left, the road leads
south to lower Aliso Canyon. You want to go right and walk about 100
yards. At a hairpin turn, ignore the road bending back south toward
Skull Ridge; you want to join signed Water Canyon Trail.</TE>
<TE>   This footpath heads west for a mile through the lovely, wooded
canyon. After passing a tower of prickly pear cactus and a sign
indicating the end of the trail, the path reaches an open area.</TE>
<TE>   To continue your exploration of Water Canyon, follow the canyon
bottom west. (No trail is present.) After a quarter-mile or so, you
will encounter more stinging nettle and poison oak than you probably
care to dodge. A more pleasant option might be to follow the faint
but passable path that veers northwest away from Water Canyon. It
climbs steeply for about four-tenths of a mile to meet South Ridge
Trail, a dirt road. Turn right (east) and enjoy good views of the
park's rolling hills.</TE>
<TE>   A mile-long descent brings you within sight of park headquarters
and leads to a junction with the main park road. A sign marks upper
Aliso Canyon Trail at this junction. Join this footpath for a
three-quarter-mile saunter south with great views of a windmill (a
reminder of this land's ranching history) and handsome alisos (alder
trees). The trail meets the dirt-road part of the Aliso Canyon Trail
connector that you hiked earlier. Turn left and retrace your steps to
your car.</TE>

<LD>Your article on Yosemite ("Yosemite, the Picture of Peace," Dec. 23)
was wonderful; the pictures added to my memory of a place I call
heaven. We just returned from a Bracebridge Dinner, and I highly
recommend the experience. When we arrived the park was blanketed with
snow, a real picture postcard.</LD>
<LD>   We stayed at the Ahwahnee, which made the event all the better
since we didn't have to take a shuttle bus to the hotel.</LD>
<LD>   In addition, we enjoyed meeting the other guests who gathered
around the grand piano for caroling.</LD>

<TE>   Your article on Yosemite brought back fabulous memories. My family
celebrated the millennium at Yosemite, a once-in-a-lifetime
experience.</TE>
<TE>   My son-in-law had made reservations for the first seating of the
New Year's dinner at the Ahwahnee. Nothing prepared me for the
stunning interior. A string quartet was playing softly. The food and
wine were superb.</TE>
<TE>   Later we sat in the lobby, drinking wine and watching the "swells"
arrive for the last seating, the big event with dancing. The men were
in tuxedos, the women in long, black strappy dresses.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Susan Spano twice mentions "high tea" in her column about Hillwood
("A Woman Who Brought Champagne Wishes and Caviar Dreams to Life,"
Her World, Dec. 9). I'm certain that brought at least a turn in her
grave from Marjorie Merriweather Post.</LD>
<LD>   The faux pas is confusing high tea and afternoon tea. They are
very different, but the confusion is common among the uneducated.</LD>
<LD>   High tea is a rural British dinner served around 6 p.m. and
consisting of meat, eggs, cheese etc. Afternoon tea is a
sophisticated serving (near 4 p.m.) of scones, finger sandwiches,
pastries and cakes. No sophisticated establishment or home would
serve high tea.</LD>

<TE>   I appreciate Susan Spano's candor about misjudging a Democrat for
a Republican (Her World, Dec. 9). Stereotypes are difficult to
relinquish for most people.</TE>
<TE>   I am a Reform Jewish conservative and have many Jewish friends
like me who mainly vote Republican. But we don't believe that all the
good guys are on one side and the rest are all bad.</TE>
<TE>   Thank you for taking an honest look at your own response triggered
by the word "Republican." Politically conservative Jews differ on
some issues, such as abortion and capital punishment, but we bond on
patriotism, a strong defense, fewer taxes, less regulation and
responsible free enterprise.</TE>

<LD>Susan Spano is right about the new hassles of security deterring
people from flying ("Looking Back, Going Forward," Dec. 30).
Tightened security is merely the latest addition to a litany of
hassles that makes flying an ordeal.</LD>
<LD>   The current focus on security, financial bailouts and "patriotism"
seems to have removed all pressure on airlines to fix long-standing
problems that include delays, cramped seating, lost baggage and
impenetrable fare structures.</LD>
<LD>   I feel fortunate to live in Southern California, where enough
wonderful travel experiences to fill several lifetimes are accessible
by car.</LD>

<CP>PHOTO: Oh, the weather outside was frightful when Barbara Fisher took
this photo of a frozen field and icicle-encrusted irrigation
equipment in Corvallis, Mont. Fisher and her husband, Ron, were
visiting a friend in western Montana's Bitterroot Valley when an
unseasonable cold snap hit in September. "While my husband stayed in
the warmth of our car," Fisher says, "I scrambled up a roadside bank
and shot this picture just below our B&amp;B." Despite the wintry
weather, the Fishers loved the region, a broad valley surrounded by
mountains and forest, just one stop in a four-week driving tour that
also took the Ventura couple to Glacier National Park.</CP>

<HD>Writers Who Have Gone Before Us Evoke Afghanistan's Past
and Present</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SUSAN SPANO</AU>
<BD>TIMES TRAVEL WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A friend recently sent me a passage from "A Lament for Afghanistan,"
by British novelist and travel writer Bruce Chatwin. The short essay,
published in "What Am I Doing Here" (Penguin Books, 1989), was
written in 1980 and recalls the author's travels there in 1962,
before the country was "wrecked," as Chatwin puts it, by the arrival
of hippies from the West (who, he says, encouraged educated Afghans
to take up Marxism, presumably leading to the Soviet invasion of
1979).</LD>
<LD>   The essay, which is really a eulogy for a lost beloved land,
brings vividly to mind a host of wonderfully exotic and archaic
people and places, from Genghis Khan to the Buddhas at Bamian. Though
I knew little more about Afghanistan than I had learned from the 1975
John Huston movie "The Man Who Would Be King" (based on the Rudyard
Kipling novel and set in Kafiristan, now called Nuristan in eastern
Afghanistan), Chatwin's essay awakened in me the desire to see this
country locked in the heart of Central Asia.</LD>
<LD>   It's foolish, of course. Never mind the wreckage Chatwin blames on
hippies. Foreign invasions and warfare have kept Afghanistan off most
tourist itineraries for decades. How much more dangerous, demoralized
and dilapidated must it be now, after U.S. bombing, the exodus of
millions of Afghans to neighboring countries and the demise of the
Taliban?</LD>
<TE>   Because I wouldn't be going to Kabul, I turned to travel writers
to take me on a tour and found that some of the best, like Chatwin,
have been drawn to Afghanistan, although--or maybe because--it has
long seemed so forbidding.</TE>
<TE>   The beauty of this mode of travel was that one writer often
suggested another. Chatwin fashioned his trip on that of Robert
Byron, an English devotee of Islamic art, who chronicles his 1933
journey, part of it across Afghanistan, in "The Road to Oxiana"
(Oxford University Press, 1982). In this wittily instructive book,
Byron tells of his arrival in the city of Herat near the Iranian
border, of Tajiks in quilted gowns, the black-booted Turkmen and the
occasional "calico beehive with a window at the top.... This is a
woman. Hawk-eyed and eagle-beaked, the swarthy loose-knit men swing
through the dark bazaar with a devil-may-care self-confidence. They
carry rifles to go shopping as Londoners carry umbrellas."</TE>
<TE>   Byron also describes Herat's Musalla, a minaret complex largely
built in the 15th century by Gohar Shad Begum, the wife of a shah,
during a flowering of Islamic art but largely destroyed in 1885. At
Gazar Gah, a pleasure garden in Herat, he finds the grave of Emir
Dost Mohammed, whom the British deposed in the disastrous First
Afghan War of 1839-42.</TE>
<TE>   By touring car and horse, Byron travels from Herat to Balkh, in
northern Afghanistan, capital of a kingdom that predated the Central
Asian conquests of Alexander the Great, left in ruins first by
Genghis Khan, then by Russian Bolsheviks. He camps amid wasps,
scorpions and snakes in the marshes of Kunduz. Because of hostilities
on the frontier, Byron isn't allowed to see the Amu Darya River (also
known as the Oxus), which separates Afghanistan from Turkmenistan to
the north, empties into the Aral Sea and irrigates Central Asia, with
an annual flow four times that of the Colorado.</TE>
<TE>   He does visit the two colossal Buddhas carved into a cliff in the
3rd and 5th centuries at Bamian, 80 miles northwest of Kabul.
Considered idols by the Taliban, these statues, prized for their
blending of Western classical and Indian artistic styles, were blown
up last year. When Byron sees them, they have been defaced.</TE>
<TE>   The Englishman doesn't much care for the Buddha sculpture of
Bamian ("Its art is unfresh," he writes). But crossing the Hindu Kush
by way of 9,800-foot Shibar Pass takes his breath away. (He finds the
famed Khyber Pass on Afghanistan's eastern border "invitingly mild"
by comparison.)</TE>
<TE>   In my imagination, I crossed the mountain range that bisects
eastern Afghanistan, with peaks topping 25,000 feet, in the company
of Irish travel writer Dervla Murphy, who biked alone across
Afghanistan in 1963 and describes the wild ride in "Full Tilt" (John
Murray, 1965). Murphy's ascent of Shibar Pass leaves her breathless
and aching. "But it was worth it all to rise gradually ... to the
still, cold splendor of the snow-line, where the highest peaks of the
Hindu Kush crowd the horizon in every direction and one begins to
understand why some people believe that gods live on mountain tops,"
she writes.</TE>
<TE>   The Afghan capital of Kabul, as it was in the early 19th century,
comes alive for me in "Tournament of Shadows: The Great Game and the
Race for Empire in Central Asia," by Karl E. Meyer and Shareen Blair
Brysac (Counterpoint, 1999). In this highly readable history, the
authors tell the story of the First Afghan War, waged by England to
assure the loyalty of Afghanistan, thus protecting India's
northwestern flank.</TE>
<TE>   Though British troops easily took Kabul in 1839, installing their
ally, Shah Shoja, and his hundreds of wives in the nearby hilltop
citadel of Bala Hissar, the Afghans were far from pacified. Riots
erupted in Kabul in 1841, British officials were killed, and the
retreating army was cut to pieces by Afghan sharpshooters atop the
Jagdalak Pass, between Kabul and Jalalabad.</TE>
<TE>   Now that I know these bits of Afghanistan's storied past, I want
to go there all the more. I would like to see Jagdalak and Shibar,
the remains of Herat's minarets, the rubble of Bamian's Buddhas, the
Amu Darya River and the National Museum in Kabul, where the Taliban
smashed thousands of statues. I want to see the remains with my own
eyes. Until then, I won't believe the country is wrecked.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>It may not have registered yet with residents, but when all the
bells, horns and whistles went off at midnight Monday it not only
ushered in the new year, it also signaled the start of the election
season in the county.</LD>
<LD>   This is not a presidential year, but with California's March 5
primary now just ahead, political candidates seeking local, state and
federal office have just 59 more days to make their case with voters.</LD>
<LD>   On the Orange County ballot, there will be 380 candidates
competing in 172 election contests ranging from the primary race for
governor to seats on the Seal Beach City Council. There will also be
26 local measures in addition to the statewide initiatives.</LD>
<TE>   In county government, voters will have to decide whether to
reelect first-term Supervisor Cynthia P. Coad in the 4th District.
Supervisor Todd Spitzer is unopposed in a primary for the State
Assembly seat being vacated by termed-out Republican Assemblyman Bill
Campbell. Spitzer's supervisorial seat would be filled by the
governor if he wins in November, as expected. Spitzer, a Republican,
doesn't want to leave the decision of who fills his unexpired term on
the county board to the Democratic governor, so he has promoted
Measure V on March's ballot. It would create a charter provision
requiring special elections to fill vacant supervisorial seats.</TE>
<TE>   Coad is the only incumbent supervisor facing ballot opposition.
Supervisors Jim Silva and Tom Wilson have no challengers. Also
unchallenged for reelection are the county's sheriff-coroner, schools
superintendent, auditor and treasurer-tax collector.</TE>
<TE>   One other major local race pits Dist. Atty. Tony Rackauckas
against Wally Wade, one of his office deputies. And there are races
for open seats for the county clerk-recorder and public administrator
posts, the superior court bench and two contested seats on the county
school board.</TE>
<TE>   An interesting race from the local perspective finds former
Assemblyman Tom Umberg seeking the Democratic nomination for state
insurance commissioner. If Umberg wins in the statewide primary, he
would face Wes Bannister, another county resident, in November.</TE>
<TE>   The main and most controversial ballot issue is Measure W, which
is asking voters--for the fourth time in recent years--to decide
whether to locate a new commercial airport at the former El Toro
Marine Air Station. There are also seven local school bond measures
facing residents as districts try to take advantage of the new law
that requires the approval of only 55% of voters instead of the
former two-thirds.</TE>
<TE>   Because Election Day is so close, some campaigns are sure to be
more intense and some candidates and measure proponents may be
tempted to take a short cut--on the low road with late hit pieces and
personal attacks. We urge them to resist any such dirty tactics. If
any don't, voters must be quick to reject the mudslinging and send
candidates a strong message that it will not be tolerated.</TE>
<TE>   In the coming weeks, we will be watching candidates on the
campaign trail, listening to their speeches and promises, talking to
them and studying ballot issues and arguments. We urge residents to
do the same. Closer to Election Day, we will make some
recommendations that we hope will help voters decide who and what
will be best for Orange County.</TE>
<TE>   Candidates have kept their campaign engines on idle during the
holiday season. But with the new year, they're raring to go. So let
the races begin.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The arrival of 2002 this past week found Orange County residents
strolling the beach in casual attire--unthinkable at this time of
year in many other climes. A shimmering ribbon of sunlight stretched
across a steel-gray band of calm Pacific horizon during the early
afternoon, reminding beachgoers of the ever-changing portrait offered
by the ocean.</LD>
<LD>   A new year is a time for reflection, and there has been a lot to
think about in the 12 years since the Orange County coastline got a
wakeup call when hundreds of thousands of gallons of crude oil
spilled from a tanker off Huntington Beach. By the summer of 1990,
life on Orange County beaches returned to normal, but it was also
clear that things would never be quite the same. A big environmental
event had shaken the public to a new consciousness of the fragility
of the local shoreline and the possibility that precious resources
could be damaged. But with the passage of time, it has been the
relentless tide of smaller environmental mishaps and threats from
inland, rather than any single huge offshore disaster, that has posed
the most serious long-term threat to the health of the waterfront.</LD>
<TE>   The tanker accident is still tangled in litigation  between
plaintiffs who are concerned that their businesses were seriously
damaged in 1990 and the defense team for the ship, the American
Trader. While that has gone on, the rest of us have experienced more
than a decade of threats from urban runoff, sewage spills, beach
closings and concern about the discharge into the ocean of partially
treated waste.</TE>
<TE>   For much of the last decade, the entire romantic vision of the
Orange County shoreline heralded in the Beach Boys' "Surfin' USA,"
with its catalog of great local beach locations, has been under
assault from a procession of bad news about the health of our coastal
waters.</TE>
<TE>   At the end of 2001, even as litigants in the oil spill were at an
impasse over their damages in a protracted paper war, county
officials were giving a bleak accounting of the record of beach
closing and harbor pollution incidents. In the last year, sewer
spills fouled the county's beaches and harbors 51 times, an increase
of more than 25% over the previous year.</TE>
<TE>   While such spills are small compared with the American Trader
accident, they do paint a portrait of a troubled coastline.</TE>
<TE>   The good news is that the public's consciousness has been raised
over this time, and regulatory authorities have displayed a new vigor
in enforcing pollution laws. The Santa Ana Regional Water Quality
Control Board recently held a public workshop on new regulations that
will cover 32 agencies that collect sewage. They forbid all spills
that reach waterways and urge better monitoring and cleanup, with
fines of $5,000 per day. The increase in reports is also due to
better vigilance on the part of local authorities after a recent
state law that ordered that beaches be closed if affected by
untreated waste. Seal Beach, for example, had parts of its shoreline
closed three times last year because of sewage spills in inland
cities. A quarter-mile of the city's beach was closed during the
prime season in July by an 8,200 gallon spill in Anaheim. Coastal
cities pay a high price in lost business when spills occur upstream.</TE>
<TE>   What is disturbing is that in recent years, such closings have
steadily increased. There were seven in 1993, 17 in 1994, 22 each in
1995 and 1996,  then the number has continued upward. It is possible
to attribute some to better reporting, but inland development and
population growth have taken a toll.</TE>
<TE>   Too often the problems come from carelessness about the discharge
of materials such as grease that can clog sewer lines.</TE>
<TE>   That's why the increased monitoring and enforcement are necessary
and important. The new rules will have stepped-up monitoring, and
agencies must create plans for managing sewer systems, controlling
grease and dealing with emergencies. Local agencies and
municipalities are going to have to prepare their communities to deal
with the inevitability of new expenditures to fix problems.</TE>
<TE>   But it's also up to all of us to think about the little things we
do that create problems for the ocean. Since the American Trader
accident in 1990, the threat from within has proved to be greater
than the threat from without. The ocean is our friend. We must take
care of it.</TE>

<LD>Historically, Orange County has had an overwhelmingly white
population. The county grand jury similarly has lacked diversity,
being made up mostly of older, retired white men.</LD>
<LD>   The county is no longer lily-white, but the jury still is. Census
figures show the county is only 51% white. About one-third of the
county is Latino, 14% Asian. The current jury panel has nothing like
that mix.</LD>
<LD>   And as of last week, with a deadline of Jan. 18, only one Latino
has applied for the new grand jury panel. No Asian has. The need for
diversity on the panel that monitors local government operations and
considers criminal indictments is more than cosmetic, and the county
is right to be reaching out in a variety of ways for minority
applicants. A panel that reflects the county's overall makeup
provides a broader background of experience and viewpoints. That
improves the jury's work.</LD>
<TE>   Economics is a problem. Jury service, which pays only $50 a day,
is a full-time job. That understandably weeds out many residents. Too
many, it seems, to get the desired diversity.</TE>
<TE>   The hours are long and the pay low, but Latino and Asian
residents, whose presence in community service is so needed, should
call (714) 834-6747 to respond.</TE>

<LD>Re "Home of Immigration Activist Vandalized," Dec. 25:</LD>
<LD>   Until the United States realizes that we already have terrorists
in our land, we will continue to overload the country's resources and
be forced to live under the conditions imposed on us by uneducated
people who have illegally crossed our borders. These people are not
vandals, they are terrorists. They make every attempt (blessed by
Vicente Fox) not to migrate legally and peacefully, but to change our
country, our laws, our language, our customs.</LD>
<LD>   The Latinos in Coe's organization are angry at the illegal border
crossers for damaging the reputation of all Americans and legal
residents who happen to be Latino.</LD>
<TE>   Rosalyn A. Franks</TE>
<TE>   Anaheim</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Barbara Coe has been a brave, patriotic American. Her house was
vandalized because she feels, as I do, that uncontrolled immigration
is wrecking America. The Times gave her four inches of space on
Christmas Day. If it were the home of a Latino, black or Muslim
leader, it would have rated Page 1.</TE>
<TE>   For readers interested in level playing fields, consider this:
Coe's California Coalition for Immigration Reform exists on
individual donations--no big corporations or national tax-exempt
funds. A local pro-immigration group in Orange County has received
$60 million over the years from the Ford Foundation alone.</TE>

<LD>Re "Disney Light Show Stings Critics," Dec. 28:</LD>
<LD>   The Anaheim residents raising a fuss over Disneyland's fireworks
apparently don't realize that the fireworks have been going on more
than 40 years. And why is that? Because all the previous residents
knew what they were getting into when they moved to the area. It
isn't as if Disneyland is this little hole-in-the-wall place that
they could have missed. My advice to them if they don't like the
smell and smoke: Stay inside.</LD>
<LD>   John McElligott Jr.</LD>
<TE>   Fullerton</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   As someone who lives across the street from the Disney Resort, let
me tell you that, apparently unlike some of my neighbors in your
article, I was aware that a theme park existed just down the road
before I bought my house. I even knew they had been shooting off
fireworks since the 1950s. Also, unlike some neighbors, I enjoy
looking out my window some evenings at beautiful fireworks that most
people have to pay $40 to see.</TE>
<TE>   This is especially true on New Year's Eve and the Fourth of July,
when most people have to venture outside the safety and comfort of
their homes to enjoy big celebrations. Is it always a pleasure? Of
course not, but the quote in your article that you can "barely see
the street lights on Katella" is absurd. In our post-Sept. 11 world,
I'd say complaints about Disneyland fireworks rank somewhere below
crying babies in movie theaters.</TE>
<TE>   As for local businesses such as the RV park in your story, they
fail to acknowledge how much they rely on their proximity to
Disneyland for their business. Their own Web site boasts "The Biggest

<LD>Re "Hope for Jews, Muslims," Commentary, Dec. 30:</LD>
<LD>   Professor Benjamin Hubbard is a fine scholar, a great teacher and
a man I'm proud to have as a friend. His commentary is thoughtful and
well-written.</LD>
<LD>   But I must comment. May his last paragraph go from his keyboard to
God's ears: "Hope has a power in and of itself to break deadlocks.
May it prevail in the year ahead." But we in the West need more than
hope--we need reality. Until a majority of Muslim clerics and
scholars condemn suicide murders of innocent civilians (everywhere in
the world!), I will tend to distrust the Islamic world.</LD>
<TE>   I cannot forget that there were few neo-Nazis in Europe who
attacked the movie "Schindler's List," but it was attacked widely in
the Muslim world. History is a catalog of struggles of civilizations,
sometimes peaceful and sometimes not. Islamists, Wahhabites and
Jihadists know Islam will lose a peaceful jihad with the West. The
Jihadists are a powerful minority in the Muslim world; the majority
is not yet committed.</TE>
<TE>   A decisive military victory in Afghanistan, followed by
humanitarian aid, will sway many. It may take one or two more such
demonstrations to tilt the Muslim balance to the West. Normative
Islam is a fine monotheistic religion, and Hubbard's peaceful
humanitarian appeal for hope is noble. Neville Chamberlain also gave
the West hope in 1938 for "peace in our time." My desire is that
Hubbard's hope is fulfilled; my anxiety is that it is not congruent
with reality.</TE>

<LD>Re "Stop the Violence; Kids Are Watching," Commentary, Dec. 16:</LD>
<LD>   One of the most important traits of an educated person is the
ability to draw distinctions between things that appear similar but
are truly different. If an educator cannot distinguish between
flag-wavers and gangsters flashing gang signs, I wonder what
qualifies author Adrienne Hurley of UC Irvine to instruct
incarcerated youth about the role of a government charged by its
electorate to provide equality and justice for its citizens.</LD>
<LD>   The thought that anyone could drag Osama bin Laden into court
through some kind of international process as our government would
use to extradite an accused criminal is another distinction a person
acquainted with history would be able to make. Courts and their
authority are hardly effective in societies where men put themselves
above the law of nations.</LD>
<TE>   Just think how nice the world would be if we could have subpoenaed
former Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic to appear at The Hague
to answer the charges of genocide leveled against him. Is Milosevic
now in The Hague awaiting trial because he was nice enough to allow
himself to be arrested? For years, he thumbed his nose at the
international calls for peace, while his henchman systematically
stripped villages of their men by slaughtering them like livestock.
What international court could call him into account? When leaders
don't respect the authority of a law higher than themselves, it's
impossible unless done so by force. History repeatedly bears witness
to this sad truth.</TE>
<TE>   So what do we teach young men who flash gang signs as a symbol of
recognition into a subsociety that prides itself on creating its own
laws? I would teach them that our country is a nation of laws. I
would teach them that participation in a violent gang is tantamount
to urban terrorism and that a country of law-abiding citizens cannot
tolerate those who engage in such activities. I would teach them that
respecting yourself and the rights of others is the cornerstone of a
nonviolent life. I would also teach them that these values are worth
defending at any cost, and for that I wave my flag.</TE>

<HD>Grand Jury Probe of D.A. Office</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>As director of administrative services for the district attorney's
office from 1969 to 1992, I prepared responses to several grand jury
audits for the D.A.'s review and signature. Never was anyone
subpoenaed for these audits, and the only ones asking questions and
reviewing files were nonlegal staff from the contracted consulting
firms performing the audit.</LD>
<LD>   Your Dec. 29 story quoted Dist. Atty. Tony Rackauckas' spokesman
describing the recently announced grand jury investigation as a
"routine audit." My 23 years' experience dealing with audits
completely refutes that statement. Another Rackauckas spokesman
stated that the challenger, Wally Wade, is mischaracterizing the
audit "to feed his negative campaign." Spinmeisters par excellence!</LD>
<LD>   By the way, this inquiry should have been initiated several years
ago if for no other reason than to examine Rackauckas' outrageous,
petty and sometimes draconian personnel practices shortly after he
took office.</LD>
<TE>   The grand jury report must be published well before the March
election so the electorate can save this once honest, effective and
proud office from further humiliation.</TE>

<TE>   The Orange County district attorney is now himself under a grand
jury probe. It appears that while he likes to squash vocational
teachers for participation in local ballot measures that are not
popular with his friends, he instead grants political favoritism with
the rich and powerful. Is this true Republicanism? There is no doubt
the Democrats will have a celebration over this. The question is what
about the Republican Party? Has the party of Lincoln sold its soul?</TE>

<TE>   I'm not sure who is telling the truth about the grand jury's
investigation of Rackauckas, but one thing is pretty clear. Something
is rotten in the district attorney's office when your newspaper can't
find an official willing to give his or her name to the paper. How
are we supposed to believe anything Rackauckas or his representatives
say when they won't tell us who they are?</TE>
<TE>   These people have salaries paid with the taxpayer money and are
supposed to be accountable. Do they remain anonymous when they go to
court or investigate crimes? I'll bet they don't refuse to give their
names when they line up for their paychecks.</TE>

<TE>   On Dec. 28, The Times printed a story that purports to describe a
grand jury inquiry into the district attorney's office. The story was
more of a campaign hit piece than a legitimate news story. It is
important to understand something about the workings of the grand
jury in order to put this story into proper perspective.</TE>
<TE>   In California, the grand jury has the function of reviewing the
workings of county agencies and of making findings and
recommendations concerning the agencies that it reviews. This civil
function of the grand jury is often referred to as its watchdog
function.</TE>
<TE>   In order for the grand jury to do its job effectively, the
investigations are confidential. It is a crime for a grand juror or
any witness before the grand jury to reveal anything about the
inquiry, including the nature or subject of the grand jury's
investigation. A major purpose of this confidentiality is to ensure
that items of testimony or evidence are not given meaning that is
false or misleading.</TE>
<TE>   Now, there are some political interests at work in Orange County
that are in competition with the grand jury's interest in putting out
true findings and valuable recommendations.</TE>
<TE>   It's no secret that there are a number of current and former
employees of the district attorney's office who want to take over.
They are conducting a campaign against me that has consisted of
continuously claiming that I am guilty of all types of wrongdoing. It
is a classic smear campaign, and there appears to be no prospect for
this to change.</TE>
<TE>   It is very clear that these people were the sources for The Times
article. Their method is to constantly fabricate things to complain
about, then comment on their own complaints as though they were
neutral and removed from the whole thing. It's really quite
remarkable. It seems that by sending unsubstantiated complaints to
the grand jury, they may have made themselves witnesses. But rather
than let the grand jury sort things out in a lawful fashion, they
appear to have gone straight from the grand jury room to the
newsroom.</TE>

<LD>Re "The Long View for Land Use," editorial, Dec. 16:</LD>
<LD>   As a supporter of the Zoological Society of San Diego and the
Center for the Reproduction of Endangered Species, I wanted to
comment on the critical importance of the preservation of the
23,000-acre Rancho Mission Viejo to world conservation efforts.</LD>
<LD>   It is alarming to observe the increasing development pressure on
one of the 25 most-threatened hot spots of biological diversity on
Earth. This critical area, which supports many rare and endangered
native species, is highlighted on the conservation maps of many
international organizations.</LD>
<TE>   Very little of this habitat and the native wildlife it supports
remain in the world. The Rancho Mission Viejo sage-scrub habitat
supports more than half of the remaining world population of coastal
cactus wrens and a fourth of the remaining California gnatcatchers on
Earth. It is home to several endangered or threatened species on the
brink of extinction. Its diverse expanse supports mule deer, bobcat
and cougar, as well as hawks, owls, eagles and falcons. Its
biological richness includes many species of rare amphibians and
reptiles, including the endangered arroyo toad and the San Diego
coast horned lizard, which is a candidate for endangered species
status.</TE>
<TE>   Its watersheds still support rare native fish including arroyo
chub and three spine stickleback. Part of its watershed drains into
San Mateo Creek, a spawning area for the critically endangered
southern steelhead, an oceangoing species of native rainbow trout.
The conservation of Rancho Mission Viejo and the rare plant and
animal species it supports is a priority for all of us who are
working to protect endangered species worldwide. To learn more, visit
the Conservation Biology Institute Web site at www.consbio.org.</TE>

<TE>   What must it have felt like riding a train across the American
prairie, witnessing the decimation of the tens of thousands of
buffalo? It must have sickened most travelers. But administrative
policy is hard to change. It takes time.</TE>
<TE>   Five Orange County supervisors hold Orange County's last open
habitat corridor in their hands. The 23,000 acres of Rancho Mission
Viejo are up for a General Plan amendment and zoning change. These
five people will decide.</TE>
<TE>   Will we stand by and watch the mountain lion, the golden eagle,
the steelhead trout become extinct? This precious connection of the
Cleveland National Forest with Camp Pendleton has been open habitat,
zoned for more than 100 years for ranching and agricultural use only.
The private owners have reaped the tax benefit and now they want the
development rights.</TE>
<TE>   When Orange County looks like Hong Kong and all wildlife is dead,
we can flush our toilets on Tuesdays and hope for a vacation
someplace where the ocean is still clean. Or we can make sure that
county supervisors adhere to state and federal laws that prohibit the
decimation of our wildlife and the pollution of our rivers and ocean.</TE>

<LD>Re "Sewage Spills Top Record in O.C.," Dec. 27:</LD>
<LD>   Since I had been exceptionally good over the previous 12 months, I
decided to ask for something really big for Christmas. I don't have
room for a pony and I still have my two front teeth, so instead I am
asking for the Orange County Sanitation District to clean up north
Orange County's sewage.</LD>
<LD>   Each day, the district pumps 240 million gallons of sewage into
the ocean offshore from where I surf. Because the waste water is
discharged under a 301(h) waiver, it doesn't receive the level of
treatment the 1972 Clean Water Act considers minimal to safeguard
public health.</LD>
<TE>   The sanitation district currently removes only 45% to 55% of the
coliform bacteria that can cause beach closures and/or stomachaches.
Sixteen-thousand sanitation districts operate without a waiver and
remove 90% to 99%. Getting Orange County to follow suit is a
relatively inexpensive present at 14 cents a day per household.</TE>
<TE>   The sanitation district's board of directors will make its waiver
renewal application decision next year. Twenty-one directors are city
council members from the cities the district serves. The Huntington
Beach, Newport Beach, Seal Beach and Costa Mesa city councils have
passed resolutions against the waiver. You can chip in for my present
by telling your city to oppose the renewal of the waiver.</TE>

<HD>EL Toro Debate Focuses on Contamination Levels</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Re "Health Issues Cloud El Toro," editorial, Dec. 30:</LD>
<LD>   Your Dec. 30 editorial strongly suggests that the entire base is
loaded with so many contaminated waste products that the land has
been designated one of the most polluted in the nation. It concludes
that the base is so contaminated that public health and safety will
require any development to be put on hold. This impression is utterly
false.</LD>
<LD>   Here's the truth from the public record: The base is more than
4,700 acres, fewer than 60 have been identified as toxically
dangerous and fewer than 700 are still being examined as potentially,
but not necessarily, contaminated. The remaining acres are safe to
use and to develop. After cleanup, every inch of the base will be
safe.</LD>
<TE>   What the county, and apparently you too, ignore is the fact that
during the last several decades thousands of Marines and their family
members have been eating, sleeping, working and playing on the base,
and none--not a single one--has mutated into a raging toxic hulk.</TE>
<TE>   Furthermore, for years commercial agriculture has flourished on
the base. In fact, you, like thousands of Orange County residents,
might have eaten strawberries grown there by local farmers. Quick,
turn out the lights. Are any of your staff members glowing?</TE>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Even before the Orange County Great Park initiative, Measure W,
was certified for the March 5 ballot, the pro-airport crowd picked up
its bat and began taking wild swings at it, missing each time.</TE>
<TE>   The latest and wildest swing at Measure W comes from the Airport
Working Group's hired gun, Greg Hurley, who asserts that El Toro is
contaminated with toxins and nothing can safely be built out
there--except, of course, an airport. Wrong yet again!</TE>
<TE>   Let's look at the facts. El Toro is 4,738 acres--7 square miles in
size. After eight years of study by federal, state and local
authorities, a grand total of 60 acres have been cordoned off as
unsuitable for near-term reuse because of toxic contamination. An
additional 650 acres have been identified for further study and
near-term cleanup by the federal government.</TE>
<TE>   The balance--more than 4,000 acres, or 85% of the entire
property--has been identified as ready for reuse. In fact, hundreds
of acres are being safely reused--for child-care, golfing and
equestrian facilities, for agriculture and for a 1,000-acre nature
and wildlife preserve. Moreover, Cal State Fullerton is paying
millions of dollars to locate a satellite campus at El Toro. Plans
are underway to reopen 1,189 housing units.</TE>
<TE>   The plain truth is that whatever the toxic contamination at El
Toro, it is the federal government's responsibility--by law--to clean
it up. I'm pleased to report that the cleanup at El Toro will be
meeting high residential standards, regardless of whether it costs
the government $35 million or $350 million.</TE>
<TE>   It's shameful that the pro-airport forces are offering to pave
over any toxic problems and let the federal government off the hook.
(By the way, it's not possible to move 40 million cubic yards of
earth to build an airport without first addressing the cleanup
issues.) The pro-airport forces should stop playing politics with the
public's health. Whether you favor a massive airport at El Toro, or
whether you favor creating a Great Park that is much more gentle on
the land, let's all agree to put the public's health and safety
first.</TE>

<TE>   Re "More Pros and Cons on the El Toro Proposals," Letters, Dec.
23:</TE>
<TE>   The desperation of the pro-airport side is bordering on the
ridiculous. One author claimed an airport at El Toro will create
(exactly?) 84,714 jobs by 2020. Certainly an amazing number for such
a long-term projection, and also patently false. The real economics
of El Toro are simple. First, airports in and of themselves are not
economic engines and generate relatively few jobs. Most airport
activity, and any related jobs, are actually part of the ripple
effect from the overall economic activity of the surrounding
community.</TE>
<TE>   More important, even if El Toro were to open, actual job creation
would be minimal. Admittedly, thanks to the sweetheart deal signed
two years ago, the labor unions would benefit from the construction
phase of the airport. After that burst, however, any jobs created by
El Toro would be offset by the jobs lost when John Wayne closes,
which has always been the singular goal of Newport Beach. The county
itself has admitted that true international flights out of El Toro
are not possible, so that fact eliminates any thoughts of a job
bonanza from international trade.</TE>
<TE>   One must conclude that the economic benefits from an El Toro
airport would be about equal to any economic activity currently
generated by John Wayne. The wonderful truth is that we can have all
job creation attributable to any airport for free by simply allowing
the artificial caps at John Wayne to expire. Then we can avoid the
$5-billion expense of building a new facility to supply the same
economic benefits that we already have.</TE>

<TE>   Orange County citizens have the choice this election of continuing
orderly planning of an El Toro airport, where no one is in the noise
zone and without resorting to dumping air travel demand onto other
airports, unduly affecting minorities.</TE>
<TE>   The Southern California Assn. of Governments has calculated that
each additional million air passengers at other airports adds
thousands of people to the noise zone. Most of them are single
mothers, children and minorities. It got so bad at LAX that expansion
had to be halted.</TE>
<TE>   Orange County will support the noise-free El Toro Airport because
a vote for the Great Park is a vote for bigotry.</TE>
<TE>   Donald Nyre</TE>
<TE>   Newport Beach</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Apparently the only constant in the lengthy El Toro airport debate
is that absolutely nobody will be changing their mind between now and
March 5. My guess would be that this has been true for the last
couple of years resulting in a colossal waste of money on both sides.
Thankfully, a recent ruling precludes the county from continuing the
expense of its comical "Just the Facts" campaign. The thought that
Supervisors Chuck Smith, Cynthia P. Coad and Jim Silva may be held
accountable for the funds wasted on this effort is encouraging.</TE>
<TE>   What would do it for me is an honest accounting by each of why
they have so doggedly stuck to this airport plan when it has never
made any sense. After all these years, the only pro-airport fact that
is true is that there is a bunch of concrete in Orange County that
airplanes might land on.</TE>
<TE>   What has possessed these three to ignore the facts, ignore the
voters, ignore common sense and ignore their own consciences to try
to foist this on the citizens of Orange County?</TE>
<TE>   Bob Rennie</TE>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The biggest sham ever is being pulled on the residents of Orange
County. That an airport would contribute more to pollution and
traffic than the Great Park is patently false. If an airport is
built, 14,000 acres of land will be set aside as buffer zone. No
residences may be built there. We all know that 14,000 acres of homes
or apartments with their families and cars will generate much more
pollution than the airport.</TE>
<TE>   The tax implications of a Great Park are unknown, as well.</TE>

<HD>A Solution for Crystal Cove</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN CAMPBELL</AU>
<BD>Assemblyman John Campbell (R-Irvine) represents the
70th District in Orange County</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>For many years I have been going to Crystal Cove. I have gone to run
on the beach, to watch the sunset, to see the tide pools and to step
back in time. No beach in Orange County combines a special place of
natural beauty, artistic expression and historic preservation like
Crystal Cove.</LD>
<LD>   But the cottages that gave the area its character are now
unoccupied, waiting for restoration. Until this community is put back
together, too few of us will be able to experience the magic of this
place.</LD>
<LD>   Now imagine what Crystal Cove could be--a place where one can step
back in time and forward in science all at once. Imagine its 46
cottages painstakingly restored as originally built in the 1920s and
1930s. Imagine some cottages where people could celebrate weddings or
birthdays or just spend the day.</LD>
<TE>   Imagine others dedicated to ecosystem preservation. Imagine some
set up for education so children from all over Orange County could
come and learn about the ocean and our area's history. Imagine others
as artistic workshops or some occupied by long-term residents who
agree to be part of the historical interpretation of the area, as in
Williamsburg, Va.</TE>
<TE>   It just takes about $20 million. Therein lies the challenge.</TE>
<TE>   The cottages at Crystal Cove have been listed on the National
Register of Historic Places since 1979. As such, they may not be torn
down and any reconstruction must be done with authentic historical
materials and construction methods. This process is expensive. The
state Department of Parks and Recreation has estimated that each
cottage will require between $250,000 and $400,000 to restore.</TE>
<TE>   That's why, two years ago, the department began negotiations with
a major hotel developer. I was told by the parks department director
that the hotel deal was necessary because the department could not
get $20 million and the developer was willing to put up all of the
money.</TE>
<TE>   When the department had no money for the project, California
enjoyed a $10-billion surplus. Today, California is facing a deficit
of about $13 billion. Furthermore, the independent legislative
analyst is forecasting budget deficits through at least 2006-07. So
if the department couldn't find the money in our best financial year,
where are they going to find it now?</TE>
<TE>   Because of the state budget shortfall, the governor has asked all
departments, including the parks department, to cut their operating
budgets by 15%. It's hard to fathom that $20 million for Crystal Cove
can be found in that fiscal environment.</TE>
<TE>   Some point out that there will be money through the park bond
measure on the March 2002 ballot. First, the bond must pass, which is
questionable in a recessionary period. And if it passes, Crystal Cove
would have to compete against other projects statewide for the money.</TE>
<TE>   That is why I have proposed another option that does not depend on
the vicissitudes of the state budget process. El Morro to the south
of the Crystal Cove Historic District occupies only 5% of the land of
Crystal Cove State Park. Those 275 homes pay rent to the state. That
rent is below market and ends up in the state's general fund. Those
leases are set to expire in about three years.</TE>
<TE>   We should double the rent immediately and extend the lease for
another 10 years. The additional rent increment would be dedicated to
improvement of the historic district. If this proposal were enacted
during 2002, it would begin bringing in money in 2003 and would
provide roughly $26 million over 13 years. This revenue stream could
be bonded, providing some $13 million upfront. And work on the
cottages could begin next year, rather than six or seven years from
now.</TE>
<TE>   And what are we giving up to do this? Not much. El Morro Village
has agreed to provide additional public parking and beach and canyon
access. The department's proposal is to demolish the homes at El
Morro and put in overnight camping. Some may not believe that El
Morro adds much to our community, but it does represent community
stability and a potentially significant revenue stream. Can you say
that about a campground? Can you imagine huge RVs rumbling down Coast
Highway at Main Beach in Laguna or in Corona Del Mar in summer
traffic?</TE>
<TE>   But my interest is frankly not in El Morro. Orange County at large
is neither harmed nor benefited by the extension of these leases. My
interest is in guaranteeing the future of Crystal Cove. There is no
argument about what Crystal Cove can be with the cottage restoration.
There should be no argument over a controllable, creative and
realistic way to do that. Let's make that vision for Crystal Cove a
reality.</TE>

<HD>There's No Future in Bad Forecasts</HD>

<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN J. PITNEY JR.</AU>
<BD>John J. Pitney Jr. is professor of government at
Claremont McKenna College.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>By now, we've all had our fill of forecasts for 2002. As we digest
these bold predictions, it's wise to remember that the future seldom
divulges its secrets. Return to the Januarys of yesteryear, and you
find that Californians could have had little clue about the immense
changes ahead.</LD>
<LD>   Sixty years ago this month, the United States had been in World
War II for only a few weeks and no one grasped how the war would
reshape domestic life. In Orange County, as in many places, the
military presence was growing. The Tustin Marine Corps Air Station
opened in September 1942 and a similar base in El Toro followed in
March 1943. But while acknowledging that Orange County was
"shouldering its full share" of the war effort, The Times observed on
Jan. 2, 1942, that "the old life of the county goes on." More than
100 packinghouses processed citrus. "Cattle graze in wide, green
pastures. Seemingly endless fields are planted to beans, sugarbeets
and other vital crops."</LD>
<LD>   Ten years later, the fields no longer seemed endless. Postwar
suburbanization had increased the county's population by 66%. The
Cold War was on, and many new residents worked in defense industries.
Still, the scent of orange blossoms stayed in the air. In January
1952 it appeared that the county would remain mainly agricultural.</LD>
<TE>   The following year, Walt Disney asked the Stanford Research
Institute to find the best site for a new kind of family theme park.
Just two years later, Disneyland opened in Anaheim, marking the
county's emergence as a worldwide tourist destination. By 1962, it
was certain that tourism and tract housing would roll back the
county's citrus groves.</TE>
<TE>   It seemed equally likely that Yorba Linda's favorite son, Richard
M. Nixon, would beat incumbent Democrat Pat Brown in the November
gubernatorial election. Nixon failed, however. One reason for his
defeat was unforeseeable early in the year: the Cuban missile crisis
of October, which eclipsed state politics and kept Nixon from
reaching the electorate at a crucial stage of the campaign.</TE>
<TE>   In January 1962, couch potatoes had two main TV choices at 9 p.m.
on Sunday nights: Bonanza and GE Theater. The host of the latter was
a fading actor named Ronald Reagan. Though he had given some
political speeches, nobody thought of him as a candidate, and
certainly not a GOP standard-bearer. He was, after all, a registered
Democrat. In January 1972, Reagan was serving his second term as the
Republican governor. Richard Nixon, the big loser of 1962, was now
president--but his reelection was in doubt.</TE>
<TE>   On Jan. 4, 1972, The Times ran a column speculating on how Sen.
Edmund Muskie (D-Maine) would govern after beating Nixon. One problem
for Nixon was GOP dissent over China policy. Orange County Rep. John
Schmitz said: "I have no objection to President Nixon going to China.
I just object to his coming back."</TE>
<TE>   Schmitz ran against Nixon as a third-party candidate, and in a
close election, he could have been a spoiler in key states, just as
Nader was in 2000. The China visit proved popular, as did detente
with the Soviet Union, and the apparent end of the Vietnam War. In
November, Schmitz was irrelevant and Nixon carried 49 states.</TE>
<TE>   Ronald Reagan was president in January 1982. But the GOP's
prospects were bleak as a nationwide recession loomed over the
political landscape. Orange County Republicans were slipping.
Democrat Jerry Patterson had held a congressional seat since the
mid-1970s, and Jerry Brown, of all people, had carried the county in
the 1978 gubernatorial election. Now Brown was running for the U.S.
Senate.</TE>
<TE>   Brown lost to Pete Wilson in November 1982, and Patterson fell to
Bob Dornan two years later. By the mid-1980s, the GOP was on the
upswing in both the county and the state. The surge would not last.
"Going into 1992, I almost see it as the year California politics
becomes unhinged, in the sense of traditional trends," said state
Democratic Chairman Phil Angelides, now state treasurer.</TE>
<TE>   For once, a prediction came true. In November, Bill Clinton became
the first Democrat since Lyndon Johnson to carry the state. Political
turbulence was obvious in early 1992 because the economy was in poor
shape. Nationwide, voters blamed the GOP White House for the slump.</TE>
<TE>   Times were especially tough in California, and Orange County
officials were bracing for unprecedented cuts. But toward the end of
January, county Treasurer Bob Citron announced some good news about
tax revenue from big businesses. The figures bolstered hope that the
county would weather the crisis. Two years later, the county was
bankrupt.</TE>
<TE>   So now that we're in 2002, what's next? The only sure thing is
that a lot of forecasts will prove wrong.</TE>

on Ventura Boulevard alone? Do you ever venture over the hill? I cannot
stress how much I miss the weekly restaurant reviews by Max Jacobson that

<LD>Now I really have to write after reading the Dec. 2 letters page in
response to "After Your House Burns Down" (by Jane Marla Robbins, Nov.
4). I feel my face burning, my hands tingling. Two years ago, my
daughter's house burned down. It was awful. She lost everything, as did
I. I lost her, my only child. She was born when I was 17; we shared 31
years as mother and daughter. She survived unspeakably horrible injuries
to her face, arms, hands and lungs, only to die a month after the fire.
"Nightmare" is an understatement. People don't know what to say to me. So
they don't. The people who knew her and how she died could never bring
themselves to acknowledge what had happened. It made them too
uncomfortable. Things are just things.</LD>

<LD>I was appalled when I discovered that, of the 100 California Nobel
laureates listed in your excellent Nobel issue, only one was a woman
("Winner's Circle," by Debra J. Hotaling, Dec. 2). If extended as an
average, that would suggest that only 1% of laureates are female. I
noticed that this point was addressed, at least in part, by Michael T.
Jarvis ("The Ones Who Got Away," Dec. 2). Perhaps they should come up
with a new prize, the Nobelle.</LD>

<TE>   Kudos on your issue devoted to the Nobel winners; it's always
inspiring to see scientists and thinkers praised. However, the comments
about physicist Richard Feynman ("The Cult of Richard Feynman," by J.
Michael Kennedy, Dec. 2) and DNA chemist Kary B. Mullis ("Winner's
Circle," by Terence Monmaney, Dec. 2) being womanizers sounded like
compliments rather than possible signs of a pathetic predator. Would you
find it equally endearing if they were proud racists? That such brilliant
men can marginalize women is selfish and unfortunate. Your issue was a
good reminder of why more women need to find their way into the
scientific disciplines.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>In "How the Prize Changed Their Lives" (by Jeff Gottlieb, Dec. 2),
Ernest Hemingway's famous words are quoted: "No son of a bitch that ever
won the Nobel Prize ever wrote anything worth reading afterward." The
most notable exception to Hemingway's rule, however, is Eugene O'Neill.
No fewer than five of O'Neill's greatest plays--"The Iceman Cometh," "A
Moon for the Misbegotten," "Hughie," "A Touch of the Poet" and his
masterpiece, "Long Day's Journey Into Night"--were written after he had
won the Nobel Prize. Nearly every important critic of O'Neill considers
these late works his finest achievement, far superior to the ones that
won him the Nobel. He earned the prize after he won it.</LD>

<LD>The crunching of tortilla chips punctuates Friday lunch period in
Room 223 at Fairfax High, and salsa from a giant jar on the teacher's
desk spices the air. I'm sitting in the back of the room, watching the
eight students. Among them is a girl in flowing black robes, with
much-braided black hair and bold black lip liner; a heavyset boy fixing
his eye makeup in a compact mirror; a girl with hair partially dyed
turquoise; a thin boy who smiles shyly but says not a word.</LD>
<LD>   I've never laid eyes on any of them before, but I'm thinking, I know
these kids . . .</LD>
<LD>   A boy in an aloha shirt appears at the doorway and peers quizzically
in.</LD>
<TE>   "The Gay Straight Alliance," faculty advisor Erik Travis explains.</TE>
<TE>   "Oh," the boy says, and quickly disappears.</TE>
<TE>   "He knew," Travis tells the students. "He knew." They all nod
knowingly.</TE>
<TE>   Fairfax High, which is adjacent to West Hollywood, has a reputation
within the Los Angeles Unified School District as a gay-friendly school.
Still, anti-gay behavior sometimes occurs among its ethnically diverse,
2,400-member student body. The Gay Straight Alliance, one of 220 such
clubs in California high schools, counters it by promoting the safety and
acceptance of gay students.</TE>
<TE>   Within the school setting, gays and gay-seeming students are "the last
group it's OK to hate," says Carolee Bogue, Fairfax dean of students. As
a result, gay teens' absenteeism, dropout and attempted-suicide rates
greatly exceed those of non-gays. Many eventually are lost to the
streets, to drugs and drink, to self-destructive promiscuity, to lives of
enduring psychological exile.</TE>
<TE>   Almost 18 years ago, a Fairfax High teacher named Virginia Uribe
undertook to fight this with sensitivity training and unambiguous
censuring. Her Project 10 metastasized through LAUSD, which became the
first school district in the country to formally address the problem.</TE>
<TE>   California is far from the worst place to be a gay schoolkid. In 1999,
after five years of trying and by a single vote, then-Assemblywoman
Sheila Kuehl (D-Santa Monica) managed to bring to pass AB 537, which gave
sexual orientation the same protection under the state public education
code as race, gender and ethnicity. California is one of only five states
with such laws.</TE>
<TE>   Written laws and school district policies, however, go only so far.
Putting resources and heart behind them is what shows real commitment.
Even LAUSD, which ought to be proud of its history in this regard, funds
only one full-time employee, Project 10 teacher advisor Gail Rolf, to
attend to the specific concerns of a category of kids Rolf estimates to
be at least 4% of the district's students, something like 30,000. In L.A.
schools, kids are still tormented, and some teachers still turn a blind
eye to it. Some principals try to dump gay and gay-seeming kids on
schools such as Fairfax High rather than work to change attitudes in
their own schools.</TE>
<TE>   "There are schools where it's hard to get a person on the faculty to
step forward and say, 'I will run a support group; I will get trained,' "
says Rolf. "They're scared to death. We're still struggling with some
who, because of their religious beliefs or other things, don't see the
necessity of being in compliance with this law."</TE>
<TE>   Which is why the kids in Room 223 are focused on reaching the handful
of recalcitrant or ineffective teachers at their school. They talk of
producing a live skit, or maybe a video . . .</TE>
<TE>   I know these kids.</TE>
<TE>   More than a decade ago, kids much like them used to gather at my house
with my oldest daughter. They'd watch movies and talk, and eat and drink
their way through my stash of snacks and soft drinks. They were, on the
whole, an artsy group, nonconformist, bright and funny, and clearly
somewhat apart from the mainstream.</TE>
<TE>   My daughter didn't come out to me and her mother till her freshman
year in college. Such a thing isn't easy for a parent to hear.
Nonetheless, it never occurred to either of us that we'd stop loving her
or working for her well-being.</TE>
<TE>   I told my daughter, however, there was one thing I would not tolerate:
She must never ghettoize herself, never use her sexual orientation as an
excuse for living a curtailed life. She must still develop her mind and
embrace the wider society in a productive way. She smiled at my powerful
command of the obvious.</TE>
<TE>   Many of the kids in her high school group, it turned out, were gay or
bisexual. They were lucky. The atmosphere at their school wasn't
especially hostile. For the most part they were spared coming home each
night sick to the stomach, and lying abed mornings crying at the prospect
of having to face another day of hell at school.</TE>
<TE>   Watching the kids in Room 223 at Fairfax High, I'm grateful for the
advances in tolerance that permit them to meet and publicly insist on
what some of us discover only in our private-most family lives. Namely,
that gay kids, like all others, deserve to be loved and cared for. They
deserve not to be hindered in getting on with the ordinary corn
chip-devouring, world-inquiring business of being teenagers.</TE>
<TE>   High school is tough enough as it is, remember?</TE>

<LD>Poetic license aside, can sports and poetry really coexist?
Absolutely, says Cal State Northridge creative writing lecturer Noah
Blaustein, editor of "Motion: American Sports Poems" (University of Iowa
Press). From baseball to bullfighting, more than 30 sports are covered in
poems by literary luminaries such as James Tate, Gary Soto, Christopher
Merrill, Marianne Moore, Quincy Troupe and Sherman Alexie. Born and
raised in Pacific Palisades, Blaustein, 32, grew up "playing everything."
When not teaching or writing, he surfs every chance he gets, "from Venice
to Zuma."</LD>
<LD>   Which came first, your love of sports or your love of poetry?</LD>
<LD>   It's a great misconception that you can't have both. In L.A., you can
exercise 320 days of the year [but you can also] read a book. I didn't
start writing poetry until later, but words were always alive in our
house. My father [UCLA Extension art instructor Joe Blaustein] was always
reading, as were my brother and sister. On the other hand, I don't think
anyone can avoid sports. It's pervasive throughout society, both as an
activity and as mega-corporate entertainment.</LD>
<TE>   Would the Bard of Avon approve of sports poems?</TE>
<TE>   James Dickey once said: "Shakespeare never did any pole-vaulting." But
we evolve. Shakespeare didn't know about surfing, but now there's a surf
contest in Cornwall, England. Who knows? Maybe the Shakespeare of our
generation surfs.</TE>
<TE>   How does poetry capture the rhythm of sports?</TE>
<TE>   Because of its immediacy, poetry puts you inside the facts. It puts
emotion to numbers. In sports, you're constantly trying to re-create
these heightened moments. A good poem, by its very nature, has a way of
locking that in permanently. You can return to it, see what you saw the
first time with the same amount of power, and then see it differently,
again and again. Was there a sport you couldn't find a poem about?</TE>
<TE>   After the book came out, Dorothy Barresi--whose work appears in
"Motion"--did a cockfighting poem. But it was too late. I didn't go after
certain sports, except I did try to limit the number of baseball poems.
But, really, the question is about the ability of the poet. The poet has
to be able to make it work, no matter the sport.</TE>
<TE>   You didn't include "Casey at the Bat." Why not?</TE>
<TE>   "Casey at the Bat" is overemphasized. It's not a very good poem.</TE>

<LD>The sound of 250 tubas playing Christmas and Hanukkah music had
music lovers in a holiday mood at the Alex Theatre in  Glendale last
month. The faithful were gathered for the L.A. area's 26th year of
TubaChristmas. The L.A. installment of the concert, which is held around
the country and welcomes all tuba players, is organized and co-conducted
by virtuoso Jim Self, whose tuba is the voice of the alien mother ship in
"Close Encounters of the Third Kind." For the record, tubas range from 15
to 50 pounds, a sousaphone is a tuba that wraps around the body, and a
euphonium is a smaller baritone tuba.</LD>
<TE>Hannah McLafferty, 16, Santa Monica, high school student</TE>
<TE>   How did you get started?</TE>
<TE>   I've been playing for about a year and a half. My middle-school band
director needed a tuba player, so I volunteered.</TE>
<TE>   What's special about the tuba?</TE>
<TE>   It's such a different instrument compared to the flute or clarinet,
which everybody plays. Why should a person take up the tuba</TE>
<TE>   ? If you're female, there's lots of guys in the tuba section.</TE>
<TE>   Your favorite tuba music?</TE>
<TE>   "Flight of the Bumblebee," even though I can't play it.</TE>
<TE>   What does a tuba resemble?</TE>
<TE>   It reminds me of an elephant.</TE>
<TE>Loren Marsteller, 55, Tujunga, professional musician</TE>
<TE>   How did you get started?</TE>
<TE>   I started when I was 8. My father played trombone with the Los Angeles
Philharmonic from 1946 to 1971. I started on the euphonium because my
arms were too short to play the trombone.</TE>
<TE>   What's special about the tuba?</TE>
<TE>   The conical shape gives it the mellow sound.</TE>
<TE>   How has playing the tuba changed your life?</TE>
<TE>   Being a musician has allowed me to serve my country in a military
band, play in a professional orchestra, travel around the world.</TE>
<TE>   Do you dream of tubas?</TE>
<TE>   I've had dream flashbacks of being in the Marine band.</TE>
<TE>   Have you experienced anti-tuba discrimination?</TE>
<TE>   Only from string players.</TE>
<TE>   What does a tuba resemble?</TE>
<TE>   A sousaphone could look like a giant twisted ice cream cone, I
suppose.</TE>
<TE>Joseph Jackson, 22,Carson, tuba performance major at USC</TE>
<TE>   How did you get started?</TE>
<TE>   This is my 10th year. I started off playing trumpet but had a desire
to play a bigger instrument, and the opportunity came in eighth grade.</TE>
<TE>   Your favorite tuba music?</TE>
<TE>   Mahler's Fifth Symphony and Vaughan Williams' tuba concerto because
they show off technical aspects of the tuba.</TE>
<TE>   Do you play alone for fun?</TE>
<TE>   I try to play like Paul Robeson singing "Ol' Man River," but I can't
do it as well as he does.</TE>
<TE>   What does a tuba resemble?</TE>
<TE>   An earlier version looks like a truck that's been wrapped in a
different direction.</TE>
<TE>Barbara Saevig, 45, West Los Angeles, bookkeeper</TE>
<TE>   How did you get started?</TE>
<TE>   I started at 12. In seventh-grade music class, there was only one
instrument--a baritone horn--left, so it was given to me to play.</TE>
<TE>   How has playing the tuba affected your personal life?</TE>
<TE>   In school I was made fun of a lot.</TE>
<TE>   Have you experienced anti-tuba discrimination?</TE>
<TE>   Mostly from people who don't have experience with music. People look
at you like you're from Mars.</TE>
<TE>   What does playing tuba do for your soul?</TE>
<TE>   When there is a very melodic part, it feels like the horn and I are
one.</TE>
<TE>   What does a tuba resemble?</TE>
<TE>   Maybe a Volkswagen bug.</TE>

<LD>Venice Beach is like one of those giant magnets they use in
junkyards to move the wrecked cars around--except that the Venice magnet
seems to draw the world's free spirits.</LD>
<LD>   John Holtz, 60, of Marina del Rey, has been one of the faithful
congregating to roller dance at the Venice Beach boardwalk for close to
20 years. He stumbled onto skate dancers one weekend with his wife during
the mid '80s and has made it back nearly every weekend since. "The only
difference between winter and summer is that in the summer you use SPF 15
and in winter you use SPF 2. That's the beauty of L.A.," he says.</LD>
<LD>   Over the past 25 years, the free-wheeling gathering has become a local
institution. Perhaps the biggest draw for Holtz is the scene's
all-embracing character. "This is a place to come and interface with
people from every region or country in the world and also of every age,
race, economic class and education," he says, noting that Tipper Gore,
Madonna, Tony Danza and Sharon Stone have laced up and rolled with the
crew. "There are no leaders. We're all equals."</LD>
<TE>   In his civilian life, Holtz is a distributor for Caffe Appassionato, a
coffee roasting company. In his skate dance life, Holtz's chief
responsibility is helping to transport and set up the custom sound system
used at the plaza. The scene gained momentum after the inauguration two
summers ago of Skate Dance Plaza, a smooth concrete area for roller
dancing. The plaza can pull upward of 170 skaters per day on summer
weekends and about 60 during winter.</TE>
<TE>   Holtz has kept rolling through job changes, an operation that removed
two vertebrae in his back and the L.A. riots, when skaters of all creeds
and colors skate danced against a backdrop of M-16-toting National
Guardsmen while conflagrations raged to the east.</TE>
<TE>   "The best relationships you've ever had are the ones you built on the
playground," Holtz says. "And this is like a big playground.</TE>

<LD>So much for the art-science split. Angeleno Syd Klinge, 39, has
always been an inveterate tinkerer. By the time he was 6, his father, an
engineering professor, had entrusted him with the task of wiring the
house he'd built for the family in Maine. As an adult, Klinge has pursued
artistic endeavors, including acting, film editing and music, as well as
electrical engineering and other scientific projects. Oh, and 15 years
ago, he built a small Tesla coil.</LD>
<LD>   Tesla is scientific live wire Nikola Tesla (1856-1943), the wildly
creative Croatian inventor responsible for radio transmission technology
and the induction motor. Tesla's coil is a transformer that resembles a
coil-topped mushroom and emits a lightning storm of electrical arcs,
accompanied by the roaring sizzle of electricity. The device proved
impractical as the wireless generator Tesla dreamed of, but it still
fascinates scientists--and artists.</LD>
<LD>   At the 1998 installment of the tribal-campout-meets-art-festival known
as Burning Man, Klinge marveled at the fireworks produced by a
16-foot-tall coil sculpture and knew he had to build his own. In 1999, he
completed a 7-foot-tall, 5,500-watt unit generating 6-foot-long arcs. He
has appeared with his creation at parties and festivals such as the
Electric Daisy Carnival rave event. "I'm incredibly drawn to how magical
and organic and primitive the arcs are," Klinge says.</LD>
<TE>   Currently he is creating a 12-foot, 35,000-watt piece with a projected
cost of $10,000. The sculpture, christened "Cauac," after the Mayan god
of lightning and storms, will feature electrical fire, organic fire and a
reflecting pool. He's also collaborating with Tesla coil performance
artist Austin Richards of Santa Barbara (a.k.a. "Dr. MegaVolt") on a
two-story, 120,000-watt sculpture equipped with a ladder for people to
ascend while the coil is firing. The pair hope that the work will draw
researchers as well as audiences. "Although the result is simple, the
science is some pretty inspired physics," Klinge says.</TE>

<HD>The Actress, the Producer and Their Porn Revolution</HD>
<DH>Steven Hirsch Recognized That VCRs Could Bring Adult Movies to a
New Market--Couples. But First He Needed a Different Kind of Star.</DH>

game console</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>You can say this much at least, the setting was magnificent--a
seafood restaurant at Sunset Boulevard and Pacific Coast Highway. San
Fernando Valley businessman Steven A. Hirsch thought it was the ideal
spot for his pitch to the blond, hazel-eyed Midwest tomboy. She loved
crab legs? He promised her all she could eat.</LD>
<LD>   Ginger Lynn Allen arrived at Gladstone's restaurant in a lace dress
and heels and joined Hirsch and his girlfriend at their table. It was
late 1984. They were young, in their early 20s, and full of vigor and
hope. Allen was trying to escape a nasty childhood by becoming a movie
star. Hirsch was looking for the money and respect his father never
enjoyed. He wanted to produce movies.</LD>
<LD>   At that moment, neither career was one to write home about. Allen was
an actress, yes, but one who specialized in talents Hollywood doesn't put
on screen. Hirsch peddled the kind of movies she made, but they had
hardly brought him riches or respect. The industry they worked in was
still very much on the fringe.</LD>
<TE>   As an overnight porn sensation, Allen knew she could earn lots of cash
for a few years before being replaced by the next wave of fresh faces.
She dreamed of jumping to Hollywood before then and had no idea what this
obscure but attractive pornography figure could offer her, other than all
the crab she wanted.</TE>
<TE>   She didn't know he was planning a revolution.</TE>
<TE>   Hirsch laid out his proposal. No other porn actress has ever had such
a deal--control over scripts and casting, marketing campaigns devoted
exclusively to her and a guaranteed income that included royalties and
could reach six figures.</TE>
<TE>   Allen was skeptical. Hirsch had little track record as a producer. But
as anyone who knows him will vouch, Hirsch is nothing if not persuasive.
He desperately needed her help. Gradually, Allen began to believe.</TE>
<TE>   Today, Gladstone's could put a plaque over that table where Hirsch and
Allen dined. It marks the birthplace of a new kind of porn--designer
porn--and its unrelenting march into American lives. These days,
hard-core sex stars date rock musicians, appear on album covers and dance
in music videos. They gab with shock-jock Howard Stern. Academics plumb
porn for its cultural and business significance. The Internet is flooded
with come-hither Web sites. Students at Yale hold coed "chicken and porn"
parties. Annual rentals and sales of adult videos and DVDs top $4
billion, and the industry churns out 11,000 titles each year--more than
20 times as many as Hollywood, according to Adult Video News, an adult
industry trade magazine.</TE>
<TE>   Hirsch has become so successful, and perceptions of the industry have
changed so much, that he was invited last May to address a USC business
class. His muscular frame clad in casual slacks and a crisp blue blazer,
the 40-year-old executive lectured his audience on "production value" and
"market share"--terms drawn from the same corporate lexicon as former
Chrysler chairman Lee Iacocca, Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates and other
industry titans who have shared their wisdom at USC.</TE>
<TE>   "Ten years ago I don't think I would have been asked to speak in front
of that class," Hirsch says in an interview later, adding that none of
the 23 undergraduates questioned the content he sells. "We're already
past the acceptance stage, and at this point we're just talking about a
business as a business. We are nothing more than widget makers."</TE>
<TE>   Those widgets have blessed Hirsch, president of Van Nuys-based Vivid
Video Inc., with an 8,150-square-foot, $1.6-million home with an
amusement park pool in a gated community on the edge of the Santa Susana
Mountains. He shares a suite at Staples Center that costs as much as
$307,000 a year. It's known as the "porn box," because its regulars are
porn heavy hitters who do a lot of business together. They sit right up
there alongside Budweiser, Fox Television and Toyota.</TE>
<TE>   Hirsch won't discuss his income, and there is no independent way to
verify the finances of his privately held companies. But he claims
Vivid's revenues reached $80 million last year, and he and two partners
recently netted some $70 million in a deal with Playboy Enterprises,
according to Securities and Exchange Commission documents and interviews.
He jets to Bruce Springsteen concerts, has several luxury cars and
collects fossils in prehistoric amber. A history buff, he also owns a
lock of George Washington's hair and a death mask of Abraham Lincoln.</TE>
<TE>   Allen's life isn't as golden. She did join Hirsch's new company, then
left porn for Hollywood before returning to the land of quick money. Her
relationship with Hirsch morphed over the years from professional to
personal to physical to nobody knows what anymore. She has a
life-threatening illness and auctions her panties at strip clubs to raise
tuition for a son whose paternity Hirsch refuses to discuss.</TE>
<TE>   "My time is past," she says. As an aging porn queen, she knows she
falls into a pathetic stereotype, but she's having no part of it. The
title of the autobiography she's working on: "I Did It. I Liked It. So
What?"</TE>
<TE>   "they'd have their fight, my father would hit my mother, and then
she'd take it out on me," Allen once said in a report prepared for
federal court. "My mother used to scream at me how ugly I was, and she'd
tell me I was evil." Her mother, Marilyn, was the illegitimate child of a
prostitute and later adopted by the son of a Baptist minister, the report
says. It describes her father, Wayne, as a former alcoholic and son of a
police officer. She grew up in Rockford, Ill., a blue-collar town 80
miles northwest of Chicago. Allen's parents separated when she was 6,
then divorced when she was 11. The next year she tried to commit suicide
by taking a dozen sleeping pills, says the report. At 13, after a
particularly brutal beating from her mother, Allen was taken in by her
paternal grandparents. Despite their care, she had an abortion, began
using drugs and her grades slipped. She also was left with an "almost
addictive need for male relationships . . . and validation," according to
the report,  prepared by criminologist Sheila Balkan for a federal judge
presiding over a 1990 tax fraud case against Allen.</TE>
<TE>   After graduating from Rockford West High in 1980, Allen followed her
grandparents to San Bernardino to help care for her dying grandfather.
She worked as a Musicland store manager, but money was tight. So in 1983,
with a boyfriend's encouragement, she answered an ad promising $150 for
figure models. It was run by porn talent agent Jim South in Van Nuys.
Things began happening very fast.</TE>
<TE>   In September of that year, Allen posed for nude photographs, and soon
she was featured in various porn publications, including Penthouse. Next
came videos--which meant sex, with strangers, on camera. As she would
later explain in a magazine article: "The money keeps coming and you get
pulled into it a little more. Things you thought were bad at the
beginning seem a little less bad." In November, Allen agreed to appear
for $800 in four 8-millimeter loops--short subjects for peep-show booths
in adult bookstores.</TE>
<TE>   Back in Rockford, Wayne Allen, who had reconciled with his daughter
years before, overheard men in a bar talking about her new career. He
found the loop playing locally and demanded that the store owner give him
all copies. After Allen's third visit, the owner called police, who sent
him home with a friend. Allen called his daughter. Porn was lucrative,
she replied. No one got hurt. Besides, it was fun.</TE>
<TE>   Her first adult feature, "Surrender in Paradise," was filmed in Maui.
She turned 21 on location, got paid $5,150, fell in love with her leading
man and began learning truths about being a porn star. "I was making more
money in two weeks than I did in two years, and I was having great sex
with someone I loved." But when she saw her fiance for the first time on
the mainland, he was wearing a dirty shirt and spoke with a New York
accent. He wasn't the man she knew. "He stayed in character for the
entire two weeks we were there." She broke the engagement.</TE>
<TE>   On screen, Allen became a sensation. In 1984, at the porn industry's
first X-Rated Critics Organization awards, she wore a yellow dress with
black polka dots from Sears, and won the veritable Triple Crown: "Best
Female Performer," "Video Vixen" and "Starlet of the Year." One
businessman who helped underwrite the awards show, giving $10,000, was
adult video distributor Fred Hirsch, whose son Steven had a plan. Bill
Asher, now a third partner in Vivid, says Steven Hirsch "grew up when
porn was a dirty, underground business. If he was going to be in the
business, it was going to be mainstream."</TE>
<TE>   the early 1980s were pivotal for the porn industry. Upscale adults
were buying into the VCR craze, which for porn meant adult movies no
longer would be limited to "the raincoat crowd" found in adult bookstores
and theaters. Steven Hirsch was working as a national sales rep for porn
distributor CalVista Video. There he befriended the head of the catalog
division, David "Dewi" James, a tall, self-deprecating British expatriate
20 years his senior. Hirsch and James became convinced that this emerging
home market included women and couples. "That's something we really felt
strongly about, and that we went after," Hirsch recalls.</TE>
<TE>   They quit CalVista, formed Vivid Video and went in search of a star.
In their view, she had to appear wholesome enough for couples to
enjoy--not like the hardened, cold actresses traditionally found in adult
movies.</TE>
<TE>   "I looked like what might be your best friend's sister," Allen says.
"I didn't look like I belonged on the street corner." As William Margold,
a porn actor and industry activist, remembers: "She was comfortably
pretty. She didn't have the kind of beauty that chilled you. It warmed
you. She came along at exactly the right time."</TE>
<TE>   Hirsch and James scraped together $38,000, including a $20,000 loan
from Fred Hirsch's printer, and started to work. Vivid's first video
featured Allen in a tongue-in-cheek tale about a millionaire trying to
find a desirable wife for his socially backward heir.</TE>
<TE>   Breaking with industry practices, Hirsch sank most of the money into
the packaging, hiring a photographer and a Hollywood artist. Instead of a
box cover showing a collage of sex acts, Vivid's showed Allen on a beach,
exposing nothing, under the title "Ginger."</TE>
<TE>   "The combination of a great box cover and young, beautiful women
became Vivid's trademark," Allen recalls. But make no mistake, the sex
wasn't anything less than hard core. The video flew off the shelves,
selling an initial 6,000 copies--a huge volume at the time for adult
videos. "Ginger" rocketed to the top of the adult charts. A tamer version
of the video was translated into 12 languages and sold in Europe, Japan
and Hong Kong.  Hirsch and James set out to make their star an icon. In
return for appearing in videos exclusively for Vivid, Allen was featured
in movies more appealing to women because they had stronger plot lines
than traditional adult movies, which were often little more than a series
of sex scenes.</TE>
<TE>   Instead of spending the money from the first movie, Hirsch and James
nursed the business along, paying themselves just $200 a week. "Ginger"
soon grossed about $700,000, which they put into a series of sequels,
including "I Dream of Ginger," "Ginger on the Rocks," "Ginger's Sex
Asylum." All were intended to sear Ginger and the Vivid brand into the
minds of consumers.</TE>
<TE>   For her success, Vivid paid Allen handsomely. During 1985, she
received $99,014 from a combination of her monthly retainer fee,
$1,000-a-day shooting premium, paid promotional appearances and an
unprecedented cut of wholesale revenues, court records and interviews
show. With other porn work that year, Allen made $134,000 and, in 1986,
pulled in $126,185, according to records of Ginger Pix Inc., her
corporation.</TE>
<TE>   Those numbers were staggering for an industry where actresses are free
agents and earn, in 2002 dollars, $300 to $1,200 for each scene they
perform, with no royalties, medical coverage or pension. Career curves
are short and brutal, thanks to the constant supply of eager
replacements. All that most of them can hope for is to parlay their film
work into lucrative nude dancing careers or Internet fan sites.</TE>
<TE>   But for Allen, life had never been better. The blue-collar kid bought
a Porsche, dropped $10,000 at a time on shopping sprees, took overseas
vacations. "I did what a lot of women do in the adult industry," she
recalls. "You live right here, right now, today." the walls of hirsch's
van nuys office today are sleek black, matching the color of the Oxford
shirts he often wears. Chunks of ancient amber are arranged on shelves
facing his neatly kept desk. One wall features a signed photo of all five
living former U.S. presidents and documents bearing Thomas Jefferson's
stamp. A backlit awards showcase gives the room a warm glow. It holds
dozens of industry statuettes awarded for "Best Couples Sex Scene" and
the like. To the right of Hirsch's desk is a Dell computer laptop showing
live shots from a nanny cam trained on his daughter's crib at home. The
mother is Hirsch's current girlfriend, Laurie Andersen, a former sales
rep for Video Team, a Chatsworth porn producer.</TE>
<TE>   Would he want his infant daughter, Alexis, to become a Vivid star? He
smiles and leans back in his overstuffed leather chair. "I would tell her
to really think that through," he says. "I would respect whatever
decision she would make. And then I would send her to medical school."</TE>
<TE>   It would be the ultimate triumph for a porn dynasty that began in the
early 1970s, when Wall Street tanked and Fred Hirsch gave up as a
stockbroker. He called a family conference in the living room of the
Hirsches' comfortable home in Lyndhurst, Ohio, outside Cleveland. Steven
was 11 and his sister, Marci Sue, was 14 when their parents announced
that Dad would sell adult materials for Sovereign News Corp., owned by
the late Reuben Sturman. A tobacco and candy distributor, Sturman became
the nation's largest purveyor of pornography, with reputed ties to the
New York Gambino Mafia family, according to the 1986 Meese Commission on
Pornography. "My biggest concern was what I would tell my friends," says
Marci, now 42. "I had a hard time."</TE>
<TE>   Their livelihood aside, the Hirsches seemed a model of family
stability. Dad's job wasn't Rotary Club material, but life was otherwise
middle-class normal, says Tony Ciulla, Steve's best friend from next door
who is now manager of the Marilyn Manson rock band. There was Little
League baseball, go-cart racing and mowing lawns or shoveling snow for
money.</TE>
<TE>   The Hirsch family joined the porn industry's migration to California
in 1975, and Fred Hirsch began laying plans to start his own company. But
he also had to face ghosts he left behind--obscenity charges from his
work in Cleveland. In 1978, he and six others from Sovereign News were
tried and acquitted.</TE>
<TE>   Young Hirsch escaped ghosts of his own. He says he was picked on in
Lyndhurst because he was one of only a few Jews in his junior high
school. The experience, he says, "helped toughen me up a bit. And it
helped give me the drive to succeed because I had to prove that I was
OK."</TE>
<TE>   An introvert by nature, he channeled his frustration into wrestling, a
sport known for its solitude and discipline. The family moved to a
two-story home on a winding, leafy street in Woodland Hills. Young Hirsch
became co-captain of the El Camino Real High School wrestling team,
earning all-city honors in his weight class. His father rarely missed a
match.</TE>
<TE>   By the time Steve graduated, in 1979, nearly a dozen production houses
were vying to reach the new VCR market. Fred Hirsch set up Adult Video
Corp. in a small storefront on Napa Street in Northridge. A bank of VCRs
hummed in the back office, churning out duplicates of master tapes. The
whole family helped, creating a peculiar bond and some awkward moments.
Marci, who worked in accounting, remembers wandering into the duplication
lab and seeing her first adult video. In walked Dad. "You have to leave,"
he said. "I can't watch this with you."</TE>
<TE>   She felt uncomfortable for about a month, she recalls. "And after
that, we would both be in there watching it. After a while you almost
forget what you're watching because you see it so often."</TE>
<TE>   Fred Hirsch's company prospered. Between 1983 and 1985, its sales
nearly tripled, to $4.2 million, and it cleared $484,000 in profit, court
records show. The firm was a medium-sized force in the porn
scene--although it since has gone out of business.</TE>
<TE>   Steven Hirsch attended business and journalism classes for two years
at Cal State Northridge and UCLA while doing a range of jobs at his
father's company--from packing tapes in the warehouse to working in
sales, promotion and accounting. Then he quit to work at CalVista and
soon, he and James launched Vivid.</TE>
<TE>   There was little money in the beginning. Allen remembers Hirsch
rolling pennies with Wren to make ends meet. But once Allen's tapes
became a sensation, life changed quickly. The three of them began
partying together. Allen says she found Hirsch attractive that first time
she saw him at Gladstone's, but nothing romantic occurred between them
then. Hirsch and Wren were tight, and Allen never was at a loss for
boyfriends. By her own count, she has been engaged 10 times, and never
married.</TE>
<TE>   mainstream respect is an idea that entices and eludes those in porn.
Hollywood is just over the mountains  from porn's prime locale, the San
Fernando Valley, and the two worlds mix socially. But porn performers are
rarely taken seriously by the studios. They are more playmates than
peers.</TE>
<TE>   By 1986, Allen and Hirsch were successful financially, but Allen
wanted to jump to Hollywood. She had grown weary of making sex videos.
"As I became more and more involved with films, I used more drugs and
alcohol," she would later explain to a federal judge. "As time went on, I
couldn't stand what I was doing. I started using cocaine as a way to
escape and a way to cope."</TE>
<TE>   In February of 1986, Allen, age 23, quit the industry. She had been in
porn for 27 months and had appeared in 69 productions, 16 of them for
Vivid. It was now or never to cross over.</TE>
<TE>   She landed her first B-film part in 1988 as a rocker chick in "Dr.
Alien (I Was a Teenage Sex Mutant)." That led to a referral to B-film
producer Rick Sloane, who was looking for a lead in "Vice Academy," a
police farce.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought the timing was right to give her the break," Sloane says,
adding that Allen came to his attention just months after her personal
and professional rival, porn actress Traci Lords, began taking mainstream
roles. Sloane gave Allen the leading role. Impressed by her comedic
timing, he wrote a sequel around her character.</TE>
<TE>   She was doing OK in Hollywood, although the money wasn't as good. She
eventually appeared in 28 mainstream productions, in roles that included
a bordello prostitute in the 1990 Western "Young Guns II"; a dying
prostitute in Ken Russell's 1991 "Whore"; a topless dancer in a 1993
Emmy-award winning episode of "NYPD Blue"; and a recurring role in "Super
Force," a short-lived kids' show.</TE>
<TE>   Through the years she continued to receive royalties from Vivid and
make promotional appearances for the company. But her income dipped. She
refused to return to making adult videos, although she did start
stripping to cash in on her X-rated fame. "The high times were over and
we were both strapped, so she needed to go [nude dancing] financially,"
says Edward R. Holzman, Allen's live-in boyfriend during the late 1980s
and now a video producer for Playboy Enterprises. In 1991, Allen reported
making $30,000 from stripping and $25,000 from acting.</TE>
<TE>   Off screen, Allen's troubles mounted. In 1990, a federal grand jury
indicted her on two counts of tax fraud. She offered a curious defense,
arguing that her judgment had been impaired by drug use in the early
1980s. Indeed, she and Hirsch had done a lot of cocaine as Vivid rocketed
to success. "We did coke in the hotel rooms," Allen remembers. "We did
coke in the limos." Hirsch also says he had a substance abuse problem at
the time. "My life was out of control," he says. "Some of it was alcohol.
Some of it was drugs. That was that."</TE>
<TE>   As part of Allen's defense before sentencing, her attorneys hired
Balkan to review Allen's past. The criminologist said she found a woman
struggling with demons from her childhood that spilled over into her
relationships--like the one Allen struck up with actor Charlie Sheen. She
met him on the Tucson set of "Young Guns II," when Sheen visited his
brother Emilio Estevez, the film's star. Allen says they fell in love.
But in Balkan's view, their relationship went beyond those feelings. "It
represented the legitimacy of being accepted by an actor and his family
in the legitimate acting world," Balkan says.</TE>
<TE>   Sheen and his father, actor Martin Sheen, wrote to U.S. District Judge
Ronald S.W. Lew asking for leniency in the tax case. After an eight-day
trial, a federal jury convicted Allen in June 1991 on one count--failing
to disclose $8,580 she earned during her first few months in porn in
1983. Lew sentenced her to probation and attached a condition: She had to
give up drugs. Legal fees from the case and her subsequent probation
violations were devastating. Allen claims those costs topped $400,000.</TE>
<TE>   As Allen and Sheen dated, she nursed him through a 32-day rehab and
stood by him when he was named a regular customer of Hollywood madam
Heidi Fleiss.</TE>
<TE>   Then, she says, he dumped her. Sheen declines comment today, but Allen
still claims he is "the only man I ever really loved." She blames her
rejection on porn. "People thought who I was was detrimental to his
career." Allen learned the lesson she always feared but hoped wasn't
true. "You can't outlive what you've done," says Wayne Allen, her father.
"It'll be around forever."</TE>
<TE>   Ginger Allen also failed to kick drugs. She had tried in 1989,
entering a 30-day rehab program at San Diego's Sunrise Center. But by
"Vice Academy III" in 1991, Sloane says, Allen had reverted to her porn
diva ways. She demanded $10,000 and a motor-home dressing room. Yet he
says she habitually showed up late, flubbed her lines and was so
puffy-faced that she needed ice packs and heavy makeup.</TE>
<TE>   At times, Allen would lock herself away for days on cocaine binges,
according to a federal court pre-sentencing report. In 1992, she failed a
court-ordered drug test and Lew sentenced her to 45 days in rehab.</TE>
<TE>   Hirsch, too, had struggled with abuse problems. With encouragement
from a friend, porn producer Christian Mann, Hirsch checked himself into
a drug rehab center Nov. 9, 1988. He says he is clean and sober today.
His partying years aside, Hirsch's world has never been about the
hedonism of Hugh Hefner's grotto parties at the Playboy Mansion and Larry
Flynt's hot-tub orgies. Vivid executives keep an antiseptic distance from
the production of what they call "the content."</TE>
<TE>   Like his father, Hirsch has hired family to work at Vivid, which now
employs 135 people. His sister and father work for him, and so did his
brother Brad, who quit recently after starting a relationship with a
Vivid actress.</TE>
<TE>   Hirsch's brilliance, Mann says, is in finding other sources of
revenue, other outlets for his videos: Playboy Enterprises, the Internet,
foreign rights and teaming up with Doc Johnson, a leading maker of sex
toys.</TE>
<TE>   Associates describe Hirsch as generous, driven, ethical--and
controlling. "Fred Hirsch is an affable, nice guy," says veteran porn
director Bud Lee, who has worked for both father and son. "Steve is a
cunning, ruthless businessman." In 1997, for instance, Vivid scored an
industry coup by landing distribution rights for a stolen video of
actress Pamela Lee Anderson having sex with her former husband, rock
musician Tommy Lee.</TE>
<TE>   Paul Cambria, a Buffalo, N.Y., attorney who represents Vivid, says
Hirsch has an "uncanny ability to make the best deals I've ever seen in
my life." One of those deals occurred the year Allen left Vivid. Hirsch
signed a contract to supply the Playboy Channel with two soft-core movies
a month. It was a deft maneuver. Hirsch shot two versions of each
feature. The soft-core version, heavily edited to show milder content
only, went for airing on Playboy's network. The triple X version went to
video stores under the Vivid label.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, Hirsch made Vivid's biggest deal ever by selling three
cable and satellite cable TV hard-core networks back to Playboy for $70
million, plus $12 million in possible bonuses. Four years earlier,
Playboy had loaned Hirsch $10 million of the $10.5 million needed to buy
the hard-core Hot network, provided the company could buy it back in the
future. At the time, Playboy wanted a toehold in the market but felt it
should keep triple X content at arm's length. Hirsch then added two more
hard-core channels and his programming quickly lured viewers from
Playboy's soft-core fare. Surprised by the shift in demand, Playboy
bought back Hot--giving Hirsch and his two partners an astounding return.</TE>
<TE>   Beyond being a deal maker, Hirsch has excelled at marketing. After
Allen left Vivid, Hirsch developed a lineup of "Vivid Girls," each
presented in the same way Ginger was packaged. "He wanted to create this
star system, like old Hollywood," says Ciulla, his lifelong friend. But
Allen's heirs don't receive the same generous compensation she did. By
signing with Vivid today, an actress makes less than the industry average
of about $80,000 a year--and some Vivid Girls make as little as $39,000 a
year. But a Vivid actress typically does gain an easier shooting schedule
and a longer career. If she's also a strip club dancer, her value on the
club circuit goes up because of her association with the Vivid
promotional machine. "The girls don't have to worry about anything," says
James, Vivid co-founder. "We handle their careers and treat them like
stars."</TE>
<TE>   Hirsch's system, however, imposes controls that would have other
workplaces in revolt. After Hirsch handpicks each actress, the company
dictates the cut of their clothing and the size of their breasts and
negotiates the frequency and types of sex acts they perform, according to
a typical Vivid contract obtained by The Times.</TE>
<TE>   Vivid Girls also surrender control over their screen names and the
scenes they shoot--something a mainstream actor would never relinquish.
Once Vivid shoots a scene, it has absolute control over its use, which
can be staggering given the various ways pornography is available. "We
recycle a movie 10 or 25 different ways," James says. A single scene can
be spliced into various video store movies, sold over the Internet and
cable and marketed as still photos.</TE>
<TE>   Vivid Girls, however, are not included in that continuing revenue
stream. The company no longer pays royalties because it "became too
complex," James says. For instance, Vivid Girl Dyanna Lauren received
several thousand dollars for her co-star appearance in the 1997 film "Bad
Wives." Internal documents show Vivid sold 54,639 DVD copies that, at the
suggested retail price of $49.99 each, would mean sales of $2.73 million.
That doesn't count VHS tape, sales through cable pay-per-view channels
and orders on Vivid's own video-on-demand service. Had Lauren been under
a conventional Screen Actors Guild contract, she would have received an
estimated $45,000 to $261,000 extra from the DVD sales alone. Vivid's
contract wouldn't survive in the real world, say 12 labor experts
contacted by The Times. "If you dropped this document on any agent or
lawyer's desk in this town, they'd laugh and throw it away," says John
Laviolette, an entertainment lawyer who represents numerous Hollywood
producers. "It's practically slavery."</TE>
<TE>   Actresses haven't challenged the contracts they are grateful to get,
although some say being a Vivid Girl isn't what it used to be. "You
couldn't get me to be a Vivid Girl again if you pointed a gun at my
head," says a Vivid contract player from the mid-1990s. "They want too
much. They get everything."</TE>
<TE>   wayne allen goes to the bed-room and comes back with a small black
jewelry case. He cracks it open. The lining says "XIV Karats Ltd.,
Beverly Hills." It holds a man's gold band embedded with a line of five
small diamonds. It was meant for Steve Hirsch.</TE>
<TE>   The ring is a bittersweet reminder that, in porn, sex isn't the
problem. Love is. Once a woman steps into the X-rated industry, she often
closes the door on anything resembling a normal, long-term relationship
with someone outside the industry. Ginger Allen says she knew this from
the beginning. "No man wants his lady with someone else, whether they're
performing or not," she told a magazine reviewer two years into the
business. Porn stars, she added, will have--"not may have, will
have"--trouble finding love.</TE>
<TE>   Allen says the greatest love of her life was Sheen. But perhaps her
most important love was her old boss. Friends for years, they became
romantically involved in the mid-1990s. Wayne Allen says Hirsch began
visiting his daughter in the evening, saying he had to be discreet. "He
kept telling Ginger he was going to have her [Wren] move out. He was
going to pay her off."</TE>
<TE>   Hirsch eventually did break up with Wren, and the parting was nasty,
says Paul Fishbein, publisher of the adult industry magazine AVN.
Fishbein says Hirsch gave his girlfriend a "settlement" for her work in
starting Vivid. Wren declines to comment. Hirsch's relationship with
Allen thrived. Soon they were talking of marriage and adopting children,
since doctors told Allen that she could never conceive.</TE>
<TE>   In mid-1995, Allen decided to pop the question herself. She bought the
gold and diamond band as an engagement ring for Hirsch, and planned to
present it to him over a picnic lunch at the beach. But she was so
excited she asked him before they got out of the house. "He said, 'Yes,'
and then I told him something that changed his mind," she recalls. Allen
won't say what that was, but her father will: "She said, 'I'm pregnant.'
He gave her the ring back."</TE>
<TE>   Records show that on March 31, 1996, Allen gave birth to a son,
Sterling Wayne Robert Allen. The father's name is withheld on the birth
certificate. Hirsch declines to comment on his personal life or
persistent reports on porn Web sites that he is Sterling's father and
pays Allen a monthly paternity allowance. "You know you've really made it
when people can print rumors about you," he says. "I'm really not going
to comment on it. I'm not going to glorify this."</TE>
<TE>   Allen remains bitter about the breakup. Success has spoiled Hirsch,
she says. "Steven went from a really sweet, assertive nice young guy to
very calculating," she says. "I think that when you go from a person who
rolls pennies to start your company to being a millionaire or
billionaire, you treat people differently. You forget where you came
from, and who you are and who was there for you."</TE>
<TE>   hirsch is in front of that class of business students at USC. He
spends more than an hour outlining the details of running a business in
the skin trade. Students scribble notes as Hirsch talks about vertical
integration, buy rates, production value. There is one term he refuses to
utter--the P word. "Pornography has always been a bad word and we're not
about bad words," Hirsch would explain later. "We're about making money."</TE>
<TE>   As he finishes his lecture, the students applaud politely. His
presentation was impressive, says Brian Francis Linhart, a business
administration major. "I never knew porn could be so cool." But
instructor Scott Wyant appears to have second thoughts about his decision
to invite Hirsch. When asked about it by a reporter, he says he sees no
"upside" to discussing it. "Think about it," he says. "A pornographer. At
USC."</TE>
<TE>   A few weeks later in Chicago, Ginger Allen is getting ready to take
the stage of the Admiral Theater, a strip joint in a tired neighborhood
on the west side. It is a Wednesday and the first of 11 shows Allen is
booked to headline through the weekend. The announcer urges the 21
middle-aged men and one woman in the audience to sit by the chest-high
stage--within easy tipping distance. Fog from dry ice shoots up from the
stage, which is flanked by two huge mock hieroglyphic bookends of nude
women. Backstage, Allen is praying to a god she says is forgiving and
watches over her in this environment.</TE>
<TE>   The sound system blares "Thus Spake Zarathustra." Then to the
throbbing bass of "Sweet Emotions," Allen appears out of the fog wearing
a sheer robe and high spiked heels. She gyrates, clamps her legs around
the ears of some stage-side patrons, dances and rolls on the floor. She
giggles and gives everyone a kiss.</TE>
<TE>   After her third number, she takes a mike, chats up the house and
announces: "I'm going to auction off my panties. Every penny of my panty
money goes to my son's college fund." A Florida man years ago paid more
than $1,000 for a pair, she says. This night, however, the bidding starts
at $10, rises slowly and settles at $45. "Looks like my son's going to
community college," she says.</TE>
<TE>   If she had her way, Allen would not be stripping. "I've definitely
made mistakes. Had I saved my money a long time ago, I'd be in a very
sweet position." At 39, the single mother of a 5-year-old finds herself
battling time and the law of diminishing returns. For a while, the
combination of mainstream entertainment work and tours on the strip
circuit underwrote her upper-middle-class lifestyle, one beyond the
expectations for a high-school-educated clerk from Rockford. She managed
to buy a Lexus SUV and a 6,600-square-foot home with seven bedrooms and
seven bathrooms for $580,000 in Woodland Hills.</TE>
<TE>   Then the mainstream work dried up three years ago. So did the big
crowds on the nude dance circuit. In a market flooded with porn-star
strippers, Allen finds herself competing for half her normal appearance
fee to strip for uninspired audiences. "Everybody's been inundated with
sex and nudity, it's not exciting anymore," she says. "So my income has
drastically changed because of too much sex."</TE>
<TE>   Allen says she has refinanced her house twice in five years to pull
out equity, but faced with a $5,500 monthly mortgage and other bills, she
recently decided to go back to porn. Charles Clay, her Hollywood agent
for 14 years, says he warned her it would hurt her prospects for
mainstream roles. She called Hirsch first. "His response was, 'Come back
to us after you get your best offer,' " she says. "It was kind of a
little slap in the face." Hirsch says Allen made the decision to look
elsewhere. "We wished her well and still do."</TE>
<TE>   Allen eventually made a deal with rival VCA, another San Fernando
Valley adult production house, for less than her asking price of
$100,000. Directed by a friend, former porn actress Jane Hamilton, Allen
ended a 13-year absence from hard-core videos by starring in comeback
movies, "Torn," "White Lightning" and "New Wave Hookers 6."</TE>
<TE>   She turned to VCA again in mid-2000 after routine medical tests showed
she had an illness, says Hamilton, who acted in porn under the name
Veronica Hart. Hamilton says Allen tracked her down via telephone during
a trade show to see if she could make yet another film. "She said, 'Jane,
I found out some bad news. I don't know how much longer I'll be able to
make movies,' " Hamilton says. "I know she has cancer. I know where it's
located. But as far as speaking the words, she doesn't actually speak the
words."</TE>
<TE>   Allen declines to confirm her illness. "I don't want to jinx myself,"
she says. She emphatically maintains it is not HIV and volunteers that
she survived cervical cancer 10 years ago. Her father says he and his
daughter do not discuss the illness in detail. "We just leave well enough
alone. We know that she's ill."</TE>
<TE>   Her illness was apparent during the filming of her fourth comeback
video at VCA, "Taken."</TE>
<TE>   Hamilton says she was forced to stop production at one point. "She
finished with a scene and was throwing up and it was obvious that we
weren't going to push on." Allen asked for work again in July because she
couldn't pay her medical bills, Hamilton says. VCA used her in a one-day
shoot for a scene in a movie starring Ashlyn Gere. "I could get a girl
who would do the same scene for a lot less money, but she is having a
tough time," Hamilton says. Allen also picked up temporary part-time work
as a director and emcee for a porn Web site run by Suze Randall, the
former Playboy photographer who took the first nude test photos of Allen
in 1983.</TE>
<TE>   Allen has tried to sell her house and continues nude dancing, against
her doctor's wishes, she says. In Chicago, she earned $550 a show, about
half the rate the Admiral pays top stars. She attends AA three to five
times a week, making friends "not because I'm Ginger Lynn, not because of
something they want from me, but because of who I am. I have people that
I help to stay sober."</TE>
<TE>   At home she is an attentive mother to a son who knows nothing of his
mom's career. For the Fourth of July, she baked red, white and blue
cupcakes and bread for his preschool class. For now, all he needs to know
is that she signs autographs for fans. A further explanation will come
later and go something like this, she says: When people want to laugh,
they watch comedies. When they want to cry, they watch dramas. When they
want to be frightened, they watch horror movies. And when they want to
feel good, they watch grown-up movies--like Mommy made.</TE>
<TE>   "I really don't want to be pitied," Allen says. "I've made my choices
in my life. I put myself in this position. I am the one who is going to
have to get myself out of it. I've been very fortunate. Most girls don't
have the career that I've been fortunate enough to have. They don't have
a shelf life of 18 years."</TE>
<TE>   Allen occasionally still receives royalties from her Vivid videos. But
they're intermittent. She says it is up to her to call if she's due
royalty money from the company. She telephones Hirsch directly. Usually,
she says, he takes her call.</TE>

<DH>Marshal and Tanya South Followed an Impulse Decades Ago That's Once
Again Familiar, Fleeing a Troubled World and Raising Three Children Far
From Civilization. More Than 60 Years Later, Two of Their Kids Are
Finally Ready to Talk About It.</DH>

Springs</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A man who has kept his silence for half a century develops quite an
aura of mystery. So I'm not sure what to expect as I drive through the
New Mexico desert en route to meeting Rider South, eldest son of a family
that actually did what so many people are talking about doing in these
confused and troubled times--shucking civilization for a simpler life.</LD>
<LD>   Over the decades, historians, writers and researchers have wanted to
know what really happened to the family that went feral on a California
mountain starting in 1932. The family members have refused to talk--until
now. It's as if I'm the first anthropologist to interview Ishi, the
renowned "last wild Indian in North America."</LD>
<LD>   The two-lane road heads into high country and crosses miles of fenced
rangeland until it eventually comes to Silver City, an old mining town
300 miles southwest of Santa Fe. Silver City has recently been taken over
by retirees who fancy the place an economical alternative to its trendy
neighbor. At the front door of a neat suburban home, I'm greeted by one
such retiree.</LD>
<TE>   Rider South is a loose-limbed 67-year-old dressed with understated
flair--yellow polo shirt and khakis stuffed into black cowboy boots.
After introducing me to his wife, Lucile, a former dance instructor at
San Diego State University, South says, "You must be hungry," and
proceeds to make quesadillas.</TE>
<TE>   He sets out lunch on TV trays in a comfortable family room dominated
by a monster TV screen. South's life revolves around television news and
civic activities. He likes to talk about the resurfacing of the high
school track and a new public playground.</TE>
<TE>   What he does not especially like to talk about is his past. Outsiders
only want to hear one version of it, or they want to assign blame. Still,
South eventually leads me out to a cluttered garage and reaches up to a
shelf. One after another, he brings down age-grimed pots hand-crafted of
California clay. The earthen ollas lead our discussion back more than 60
years, to Ghost Mountain, a remote mountaintop 60 miles east of San
Diego, where he and his two siblings were raised.</TE>
<TE>   The South family's experiment ended after an impressively long run.
There was an angry divorce accompanied by accusations of infidelity and
neglect. The sun-browned children were cast out into civilization and
would scarcely be heard from for decades.</TE>
<TE>   Over the years, attempts to find out about their lives in the wild
have been rebuffed with a brief comment or two from family members. When
a state parks historian contacted Tanya South in 1983, the mother replied
she wanted nothing to do with glorifying such a "stark, miserable
existence." Out of respect for their mother, none of the children have
discussed the experiment in public.</TE>
<TE>   Tanya South died in 1997. It happened that when I called, two of the
Ghost Mountain children, Rider and Victoria, were ready to tell their
side of the story. Rudyard South, the younger of the two brothers, has
changed his name and conveyed through Rider that he wants no part of
revisiting that time and place.</TE>
<TE>   Visitors to Anza-Borrego Desert State Park still make pilgrimages to
Ghost Mountain to see the ruins of Marshal South's dream. The place is
just as silent and lonely today as it was when the Souths lived there.
You turn off a park road and drive three miles of jeep track to the base
of a big hill. Trudging up the steep, mile-long path to the homestead,
visitors can't help but think of the South kids, who once pounded this
same snaky route barefoot in winter cold and 120-degree heat.</TE>
<TE>   Nestled in a little wind-protected bowl atop the mountain is the
crumbling framework of the South's adobe, where Marshal and Tanya South
conducted a grand 15-year experiment in back-to-nature living. Marshal
and Tanya found the homesite in 1932 when they were searching for a place
to drop out of society and wait out the Depression. The Australian-born
writer had made a living writing romantic novels of the American West. He
eventually drifted to Oceanside, where he met his Russian-born wife-to-be
at the Rosicrucian Fellowship, an international association of Christian
mystics dedicated to preaching and healing the sick.</TE>
<TE>   The couple shared an interest in literature and metaphysics; Tanya
wrote poems, read palms and believed in ghosts. She had been a student at
Columbia University and worked as a secretary on Wall Street. But when
she married Marshal in 1923, she was destined to leave her urban ways
behind.</TE>
<TE>   Writing jobs were scarce during the Depression, so rather than
struggle on in the city, the couple decided to pursue the sort of Wild
West life Marshal often described in the pulp Westerns he wrote. "We were
temperamental misfits and innate barbarians," South wrote in a 1939
article for the Saturday Evening Post. "We were not equal to the job of
coping with modern high-power civilization."</TE>
<TE>   The Souths weren't the first, or the last, family to move off the
grid. Since Henry David Thoreau, Americans have embraced the
back-to-nature fantasy. It has spawned books and movies, including Paul
Theroux's "The Mosquito Coast," about a Marshal South-type patriarch who
drags his brood to the jungles of Honduras.</TE>
<TE>   Recent news bought to light other real-life cases of isolationist
families. John "Rajohn Lord" Davis shielded his family from mainstream
culture in a camouflaged desert compound near Twentynine Palms, an
experiment that ended in tragedy. Facing charges of child abuse and
murder, Davis hanged himself in a jail cell last March. In another case,
the six children of JoAnn Dunn McGuckin--kids who also grew up without
running water or society--holed up in a north Idaho house for five days
in May and June until police coaxed them out.</TE>
<TE>   In each case, the fate of the kids seems to somehow vindicate or
condemn the parents' lifestyle.</TE>
<TE>   Marshal and Tanya South had three children while living in the wilds,
and Rider (named for adventure writer H. Rider Haggard), Rudyard (for
Rudyard Kipling) and Victoria became guinea pigs in an effort to prove
the superiority of a Thoreau-like existence.</TE>
<TE>   Cut off from society, the family tried to imitate the lifestyle of
early Indians. They gathered mesquite beans, dined on roasted mescal, did
without electricity and running water and fashioned the clay pots Rider
South now stashes in his garage. Marshal proudly claimed the family had
"slipped from the skirts of civilization."</TE>
<TE>   Every nail, bed frame and drop of water had to be hauled in 14 miles
from a nearby ranch and carried up the steep trail, barefoot and often in
brutal heat. Marshal, a skinny 140 pounds, designed a pack board of agave
stalks that would allow him to carry 100-pound bags of cement and
potatoes. He eventually constructed a system of cisterns and basins to
capture rainwater, but the bulk of the family's water was transported up
the mountain on a stretcher-type device. Bathing was a luxury, one the
family soon abandoned.</TE>
<TE>   Despite their reclusive ways, the Souths became nearly as well-known
as modern sitcom stars. Marshal publicized the family's adventures in
articles he wrote for the Saturday Evening Post and Arizona Highways, as
well as seven years of monthly columns for a then-popular magazine called
Desert, the Outside magazine of its day. Desert captivated a national
audience hungry for tales of escape and adventure.</TE>
<TE>   To bored housewives in Syracuse and men building dive bombers for
World War II, a naked, tortoise-herding boy named Rider South came to
symbolize jubilant freedom. Kids wanted to be Rider South. "I thought:
'Why can't I live like that and not have to go to school?' " recalls
Robert Coody, a special collections librarian in Flagstaff, Ariz., who
read Desert Magazine while growing up. "This is real learning and real
living."</TE>
<TE>   The details of survival on the mountain were dramatic enough, but the
real literary possibilities of the project didn't become clear to Marshal
until the kids were born. (Tanya traveled to an Oceanside hospital for
the births.) Rider, Rudyard and Victoria quickly became the stars of the
monthly columns, with their pets taking a close second billing: tortoises
named Mojave, Don Antonio and Grandpa, burros Rhett and Scarlett. The
kids were home-schooled by Tanya, and they carved bows and arrows with
Marshal.</TE>
<TE>   Included in each installment of the family's story were Marshal's
diatribes on self-sufficiency, anti-materialism, nudism (wild animals
accept a naked man better than a clothed one, he wrote) and the superior
ways of the Cahuilla and Kumeyaay Indians who once lived on their
hillside, leaving behind blackened agave-roasting pits.</TE>
<TE>   In photos that accompanied the columns, the family looks remarkably
like a lost tribe. The utopian patriarch, Marshal, wears only a loincloth
and has his long iron-gray hair tied back with a strand of ribbon. Eldest
son Rider, tanned and scowling, wears his streaming red hair parted in
the center and tied in two pigtails. Perhaps he was only squinting in the
sun, but the scowl and his long, tangled mat of hair make him look fierce
and inscrutable.</TE>
<TE>   The monthly columns became the most popular item in Desert Magazine
and inspired floods of mail from wartime readers who wished they had the
courage to do what the Souths were doing. Mary E. McVicker wrote of the
family in 1943: "Their spirit is a flickering candle flame, a tiny beacon
of reassurance in a confused and troubled world."</TE>
<TE>   Yet there were dissenters who said the Souths were wrong to deprive
their children of society--the same argument that comes up today whenever
survivalists, hippies or polygamists such as Utah's Tom Green family
(recently in the news when Green was convicted of bigamy) attempt a break
from the mainstream. True, the South kids knew how to make sandals from
the fibers of the yucca plant. But what about choosing sides for
softball? What would become of them once they left the mountain?</TE>
<TE>   "You are gratifying your own selfish desire to make and dominate your
own little world," wrote Susan Groene in an open letter to Marshal South,
printed in Desert's October 1944 issue. "Your family will be sacrificed
on the altar of your fetishism."</TE>
<TE>   Groene's forebodings seemed particularly prescient in the winter of
1947, 15 years after Marshal and Tanya first came upon the agave-dotted
clearing on the mountain. There were rumors that Marshal was having an
affair with Myrtle Botts, the librarian in Julian, which, at 21 miles
away, was the closest town to the Souths. Though longtime Julian
residents still swear there was an affair, Bott's daughter, Jeri Wright,
denies it. "Marshal South was a kind and wonderful man," says the
85-year-old San Diego resident. "My whole family liked him very much.
Even my Grandma loved him."</TE>
<TE>   Still, the wild family from Ghost Mountain made its first public
appearance in a San Diego courtroom in 1947. The occasion: a divorce
proceeding.</TE>
<TE>   Rider was then 13, Rudyard was 9 and Victoria 7. "The South family
presented a strange appearance in the austere courtroom," a reporter
noted. The kids were as skittish as rabbits--and why not, they had never
gone to school or lived among people.</TE>
<TE>   Tanya South told the judge that she and her children were often
stranded in the desert when her husband took off in their 1929 Model A
Ford--their only connection with the outside world. Based on Tanya's
complaints, the judge granted a divorce and gave her custody of the
children. He ordered Marshal to pay $25 a month in child support, a big
chunk of the total $40 a month he made writing his magazine column.</TE>
<TE>   Marshal South moved to Julian, dying of heart failure the following
year at age 62. He was buried there in an unmarked grave.</TE>
<TE>   All these years later, Rider still has plenty of red in his swept-back
hair, and he has retained his trademark scowl and ironic shrug. With his
planed face full of dramatic lines, he could pass for an Indian. (His
father took advantage of his angular features to hint that he might have
Native American ancestry.)</TE>
<TE>   Filling in what happened after the family left Ghost Mountain, Rider
says his mother moved the kids to Carlsbad. They lived on welfare for
several years. One of Tanya's first items of business was to get the
children haircuts, an occasion noted in the San Diego newspapers. Tanya
got a job cleaning the movie theater in Carlsbad, and Rider eventually
took a paper route to help support the family. They had never had much in
the way of material goods on the mountain, but only now--living in
town--did they feel poor.</TE>
<TE>   Going to school was "a shock," Rider says. Academically the South
children were up to par, but other kids found them peculiar. "We were
sort of scared of everybody," Rider says. At 18, Rider apprenticed at the
North Island Naval Air Station in San Diego and never left. He spent 35
years installing gas tanks in Navy planes.</TE>
<TE>   Most of his fellow mechanics never knew they were tightening bolts
alongside a former wild child from Ghost Mountain. All of his adult life,
Rider avoided telling people about his unconventional childhood. His
sister, Victoria Morgan, now 61 and a retired software engineer in Kent,
Wash., confirmed in a phone interview that she, too, never discussed her
wilderness childhood. If pressed about their history, Rider and Victoria
would just say vaguely that they grew up in San Diego County.</TE>
<TE>   Early on, Rider and Victoria got into the habit of keeping quiet
because everyone seemed to want to hear only one version of the
story--the Swiss Family Robinson version promulgated by their father.
Their mother, Tanya, was particularly stung by the one-sided tale, so
much so that she once wrote her own account. According to Victoria,
Tanya's version didn't sell because "it was tinged with bitterness."
Victoria told her mother that if she toned it down, people would want to
hear her story. Angry and despairing, Tanya destroyed the manuscript.</TE>
<TE>   Tanya felt Marshal was idolized, his Ghost Mountain scheme
idealized--while she was vilified for breaking up the grand experiment.
"People thought Father was a hero and she was the villain for taking us
away from that life," Rider says. "Later everyone would say how wonderful
it must have been to live with that wonderful Marshal South. That really
made her mad.</TE>
<TE>   "The reality of it was vastly different than Father portrayed it,"
Rider adds. "Did you see the movie 'Castaway'? That was sort of like our
life. It's like we were there on an island with these coconuts. We didn't
have any friends. We got sunburned every day." He shrugs and offers a
half-smile to let you know he can laugh at it all now.</TE>
<TE>   The photos readers adored--such as the one showing Rider standing on a
boulder with a feather in his hair, practicing with a bow and arrow--were
posed. The garden where they supposedly grew their own food was the size
of a sofa. "Father wrote stories about how we lived off the land, but you
can't live off rock," Rider says. "If you've been up there, you know
there was nothing to eat. It sounds romantic to say we had century plant
roasts every spring. But it was essentially a picnic out there. Our food
came from town." Visitors to Ghost Mountain can still find a large dump
of rusted cans behind a boulder.</TE>
<TE>   Despite his tone of wry disdain, Rider says his father was not
intentionally duping the public. He believed in the values he espoused;
he just couldn't pull off a total back-to-the-land existence. "He
believed it," Rider says. "But he could talk it more than he could do
it." Where reality fell short of the ideal, the writer embellished.</TE>
<TE>   All this time, people have assumed that what went wrong on Ghost
Mountain was the experiment itself--the back-to-nature life was just too
punishing. But if their lives were not as idyllic as Marshal South
painted them, the children say they weren't that bad either. Both Rider
and Victoria say they were never hungry or thirsty, and they got to do
things--such as staging tortoise races--that other kids didn't.</TE>
<TE>   Hearing the Ghost Mountain children tell it, the real problem was not
the experiment. It was the marriage. "Right from the start, my parents'
marriage was not a great marriage," says Victoria. "He [Marshal] wasn't a
responsible person from the start, so they went out there where he could
be even less responsible."</TE>
<TE>   the experiment left its mark on rider south in quirky ways. he never
developed a liking for music or sports. Due to early deprivations, he
can't bring himself to turn off the shower until the last drop of hot
water is drained from the tank. The limited dining opportunities on "the
hill," as Rider calls Ghost Mountain, also left him with a taste for odd
food combinations--frozen peas with chocolate syrup and pie with
guacamole.</TE>
<TE>   But these are minor eccentricities, and not what I drove all the way
to Silver City to discover. What I and others have really wanted to know
all these years was: How did the wild children turn out? Do their lives
vindicate their father's dream?</TE>
<TE>   By most measures, the brood raised on Ghost Mountain is a success.
They're financially secure; they have families of their own (Rider has
two grown sons from a former marriage) and the families are close. On the
caring and kindness scale, too, the kids have prospered. Rider South
sends birthday cards to people he's only met once, and he thinks nothing
of driving across several states to comfort a friend in trouble.</TE>
<TE>   But if the kids are a testament to their raising, they are not exactly
the sort of testament Marshal South wished to create. His aim was to
spring his children from the snares of civilization--"the factory," as he
called it. But Rider went to work in an aircraft factory and stayed there
most of his adult life. One of his proudest possessions is a plaque
awarded for five years of service without ever missing a day of work.</TE>
<TE>   His idea of freedom is a paid-off house and car and a government
pension. Without a trace of his shrug, he says: "Life is pretty good.
This is about as good as it's going to get."</TE>
<TE>   And while Marshal South was, in essence, a tree-hugger, Rider is a
Republican who supports oil drilling in the Arctic and says
environmentalism just isn't pragmatic. As for primitive living and
wilderness adventure, "Rider doesn't even like to barbecue," says his
wife.</TE>
<TE>   Victoria, too, was left with few sentimental notions about the simple
life. "I have no use for the desert," she says. "None whatsoever."</TE>
<TE>   It seems too pat to say that what one generation rejects the next
embraces--but there it is. Marshal and Tanya South chose the wilderness
over town, clay pots over Tupperware. Rider South stores those handmade
pots in his suburban garage and makes lunch on a Taco Bell Quesadilla
Maker.</TE>

<DH>The California Designers Who Transformed the Arcane World of
Typography Face an Existential Challenge: What Becomes a Revolutionary
After the Revolution?</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD CHEVERTON</AU>
<BD>Richard Cheverton last wrote for the magazine about an exhibit of
photos from the Los Angeles Police Department archives</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Let us ponder the letter "a." And, for that matter, its 25
next-door neighbors, not to mention commas, periods, ampersands, dollar
signs, colons, semicolons and dashes--in other words, the primordial
alphabet soup that you, dear reader, are swimming in right here on this
page. Let us also consider the millions of other letters, of all shapes
and sizes, that make up this Chihuahua-killer of a Sunday paper.
Seen--and yet not seen.</LD>
<LD>   It's the enigma, the weird mystery of typography--and of typographers.
Because someone, possibly dead five centuries, maybe living a block or
two away, has actually designed each one of these letter forms. Agonized,
perhaps for years, over the precise bend of the top curlicue of the
letter "a," deciding whether to end it with a little round knob or a
sharp wedge. You get the idea.</LD>
<LD>   As if that's not enough, the type designer faces a challenge: how to
create a distinct font (as the alphabet is called in the trade's hermetic
lingo), yet a font that will, essentially, disappear into the content.
Such was the conventional wisdom among the elite who designed type--from
Johann Gutenberg to William Caslon to Giambattista Bodoni to Frederic
William Goudy--until . . . well, 1984.</LD>
<TE>   If there is a point of singularity for the end of that 500-year status
quo, it might be the moment that year in Berkeley when a pair of young
designers named Rudy VanderLans (a recent immigrant from Holland) and his
wife, Zuzana Licko (from Slovakia), decided to publish a magazine. They
called it Emigre.</TE>
<TE>   VanderLans dug $1,500 out of savings and printed 500 copies. By the
ruthless economics of magazine publishing, their venture should have died
on the spot. But something happened. Technology struck.</TE>
<TE>   "We had this machine, this Macintosh," VanderLans recalls. "We bought
it for $900, and then noticed that it could allow us to set our own type.
And the bonus on top of that, you could make your own typefaces."</TE>
<TE>   It</TE>
<TE>started a chain of events that changed the lives of these two emigres,
changed the face of their craft forever, created a little company with an
immense impact--and also posed a new set of challenges, and perhaps
threats, to two innocent computer tinkerers. It was the typographic
equivalent of the cosmic Big Bang.</TE>
<TE>   the influence of the computer spread relentlessly through the
ever-expanding type-design universe.</TE>
<TE>   "What happened is that we put out our magazine and designers started
seeing these funky fonts we were doing on this crazy little Macintosh
computer," says VanderLans. Adds Licko: "There was a vacuum--ideas were
possible that weren't possible before."</TE>
<TE>   The original Licko (pronounced Litch-ko) fonts were greatly limited by
the crude computer-printer technology of the day--each character was a
"bitmap," a stack of itty-bitty black boxes (called pixels) arranged in a
grid. "OK, so if you limit yourself to a little grid of five-by-seven
[pixels]," says Licko, "and you have 35 little pixels, how do you make a
letter out of that? It was just a little game at that point."</TE>
<TE>   Her "game" yielded a handful of notched new typefaces--Coarse
Resolution, Oakland, Emperor and Universal, all in 1985. They were
undeniably crude, but also brash and very cool.</TE>
<TE>   Designers couldn't wait to get their hands on them. Licko and
VanderLans, almost as an afterthought, started publishing them--tossing
off copies on cheap 3.5-inch floppy discs. Technology quickly caught up
with typography: Adobe's new PostScript software allowed letters to
become subtle sets of smooth mathematical curves; dot-matrix printers
were made obsolete by laser printers. Now the little black boxes were
almost microscopic. Software allowed designers to draw letters quickly,
then test them without "a gazillion Xeroxes pasted together," as one
typographer put it.</TE>
<TE>   The result was a torrent (by typographic standards) of new typefaces
from Licko: Modula, Citizen and Matrix in 1986. "I love the
building-block approach," says Licko. So she designed typefaces almost
like Lego toys, with "modular" elements easily snapped together.</TE>
<TE>   That approach broke all kinds of traditional rules--typographers,
after all, often labored for years to create differences between letters
in a font. For example, every font has a "base line," like the thin blue
line in a child's tablet. But in traditional fonts, not all letters sit
on top of that line: some protrude just a smidge below it to make a
sophisticated optical correction--sort of like the ancient Greeks
slightly bowing columns to make them appear straight. Licko's letters sat
uniformly on that base line. The letter "o" might be recycled to become
the round part of the "p" or the "d." Over the span of four years, Licko
cranked out nine more fonts--from Lunatix to Totally Gothic.</TE>
<TE>   VanderLans deployed them in Emigre magazine in startling new ways,
aided by the revolution in computerized desktop publishing that allowed
designers to move things around with giddy abandon, cramming, jamming,
overprinting, skewing, slanting, distorting.</TE>
<TE>   "All of a sudden," says VanderLans, "it exploded. And we got to know
this whole group of people. They came out of the woodwork--"</TE>
<TE>   Adds Licko (after 19 years of marriage, they have a way of completing
one another's sentences): "Remedy was the second typeface we released.
That came totally out of the blue. It just came in the mail--"</TE>
<TE>   "Done by a German, of all people," says VanderLans.</TE>
<TE>   "And he's extremely precise," says Licko. "This kind of hand-drawn
[look] doesn't go with that aesthetic."</TE>
<TE>   Remedy looks like the doodlings of someone in a rubber room: the
letters are itchy, crude, obsessive. If fonts are supposed to start with
exquisitely hand-drawn calligraphy (another rule Licko happily
disregards), this was lettering drawn with a Crayola in a very unsteady
hand. Yet, weirdly enough, the font sold.</TE>
<TE>   "When that started happening," says VanderLans, "there were very few
outlets to take these fonts. Adobe wasn't interested in doing that kind
of stuff--"</TE>
<TE>   "But now they are!" says Licko.</TE>
<TE>   "Remedy has been a great inspiration to many people," continues
VanderLans with a laugh. "At that time, I don't think we were thinking,
'This is going to be huge.' Especially when people were saying, 'God,
this really looks ugly.' "</TE>
<TE>   Emigre was producing fonts that, at first sight, looked ungainly,
willfully illegible, downright obnoxious in an in-your-face way. There
were details in some of Licko's fonts that would curl a typographer's
toes--check out the fish-hook tail on the letter "g" in Matrix or the
funky Felix-the-Cat-clock tail of the "g" in Lunatix Light.</TE>
<TE>   "Zuzana's work has almost, like, a vernacular quality to it," says
VanderLans. "Because she is not steeped in the traditions of, you know,
type design. So she's adding this kind of vernacular, non-educated twist
to it, sort of self-taught. I'm looking for another word and it's just
escaping me."</TE>
<TE>   Licko laughs. "Amateurish?"</TE>
<TE>   But then the Emigre fonts escaped; they began popping up on CD covers,
in near-mainstream publications, in ads for Nike shoes and Cadillacs.
Suddenly, the kids from Berkeley were on the map.</TE>
<TE>   "Emigre was an extremely popular magazine," says typographer Jim
Parkinson, whose laundry list of fonts and logos includes the Rolling
Stone and Newsweek magazine mastheads. "There was a time when it was
state of the art. There wasn't a graphic designer who didn't have a
subscription to Emigre. It had an enormous impact [on font design]. They
were very nontraditional. They had a style that appealed to younger
designers and to a youth market. Type and typography have so many facets.
There's book typography and newspaper typefaces, advertising typefaces,
display, text, all kinds of things, and many of them are based on classic
forms. Emigre kind of tossed a lot of that out the window."</TE>
<TE>   the new york design priesthood's reaction was swift and savage. mobil
Oil logo designer Massimo Vignelli denounced Emigre's fonts as garbage,
lacking depth, refinement, elegance or a sense of history. Type critic
Steven Heller lashed the movement in a 1993 article called "The Cult of
the Ugly."</TE>
<TE>   Licko responded with cool understatement: "The personal computer has
given virtually equal design opportunities to laypeople and professionals
alike."</TE>
<TE>   Bay Area designer Chuck Byrne put it more bluntly: "In the last 50
years or so, making a reputation for yourself was basically a process of
winning competitions, getting your work published and going around
pontificating to the world about how great you are. What drove the
establishment crazy was that Rudy and Zuzana totally short-circuited this
apprenticeship and became famous simply by designing for this
international group of admirers."</TE>
<TE>   Today, if one is literate and reasonably well-read, it is hard to
avoid reading an Emigre font. It was as if the revolutionaries had broken
into the palace of typography and were now sitting in the big chairs,
their former foes relegated to the shadows. In fact, a year ago,
arch-critic Vignelli designed a direct-mail poster using Filosophia, a
new Emigre font drawn by Licko.</TE>
<TE>   The duo now have a thriving business, selling fonts as well as a
diversified line that includes music, books, posters and even pajamas.
They give their magazine away for free to anyone with any tenuous
connection to the design game; circulation is around 45,000. It pays for
itself by peddling Emigre's fonts.</TE>
<TE>   Emigre's main office is tucked away in a leafy, non-cutting-edge
residential neighborhood in Sacramento. VanderLans and Licko started the
business in Berkeley, then pulled stakes to find cheaper digs. The Bay
Area lured them back, but they left the business operation in Sacramento.
They now commute one day a week to the office, which is otherwise run by
Tom Starback, their sales manager, whom VanderLans calls "the third leg
of the stool."</TE>
<TE>   "We're not Steve Jobs, that's for sure, but we live a comfortable
life," says VanderLans. The home he shares with Licko is a couple of
blocks from Alice Waters' Chez Panisse restaurant. After rising at 7
a.m., their commute is a flight of stairs to their separate offices. They
collaborate, in a manner of speaking: "Oftentimes I use [Rudy] as a
contrary indicator," says Licko. "Like, I'll ask him, 'Which of these
three would you choose?' And I'll say, 'OK, that's not what I'm using.' "</TE>
<TE>   They take afternoon breaks for walks and socializing--that's something
new, says VanderLans. Emigre's first 10 years "ruined our social life
because it's all we did."</TE>
<TE>   Maybe because they are emigres, they somehow managed to miss the
American preoccupation with big-bigger-biggest. "We've really pushed the
envelope, design-wise," says VanderLans, "[but] business-wise we are very
chicken. We could have done the other thing, as many design studios would
have done, just said, 'Let's hire five or 10 designers and take on all
these jobs that are coming to us.' But that didn't seem to be our thing
at all because we didn't want to become managers. We're very hands-on
people. Zuzana still designs our typefaces. I'm still involved in my
magazine. We enjoy that. So I guess we've kept the stakes low for
ourselves, which has worked just perfectly fine."</TE>
<TE>   Along the way, there have been assorted typography awards, although
there are still screams--muffled, of course--from design pros, enough to
prompt VanderLans to retort on Emigre's Web site (www.emigre.com) that
new fonts and designs, "like anything subversive, eventually gets decoded
and co-opted by the mainstream."</TE>
<TE>   and therein lies the new challenge. Post-Licko, type is something we
regard as casually as this year's hemline; type is flippant, fun,
perishable. Here today, gone tomorrow.</TE>
<TE>   See the beginnings of a crisis for our revolutionaries? When type
becomes fashion . . . well, just ask Tommy Hilfiger about that.
VanderLans laughs at the conundrum he calls "the million-dollar
question"--where to next?</TE>
<TE>   "You can't hang around for very long and be a top player because
you'll just outdate yourself style-wise," he says. "And that's something
that the outside world will have to tell me is true or not-- whether we
had our peak and we're now totally old hat."</TE>
<TE>   VanderLans has published a new book of his photography ("Supermarket,"
Gingko Press). Emigre is still releasing challenging fonts: its latest,
Dalliance, is from Frank Heine, the German who tossed Remedy over
Emigre's transom in 1992. Emigre's hottest font right now is a Licko
creation called Mrs. Eaves. It's Licko's restatement of a typeface called
Baskerville, cut by the great English typographer John Baskerville in the
mid-1700s (Ben Franklin was said to be fond of the font).</TE>
<TE>   "Baskerville's work was severely criticized by his peers and critics
throughout his lifetime and after," Licko wrote on Emigre's Web site.
"From personal experience, I could sympathize."</TE>
<TE>   She also is revisiting some of the old bitmap fonts and tinkering with
a new text face that she may call Fairplex for reasons even she's not
sure about. One gets the impression that the million-dollar question is
not something that keeps VanderLans and Licko awake at night. At the ripe
old age of 39 (Licko) and 46 (VanderLans), the pair have made the most
perilous transition facing any revolutionary: they have survived success.
They have become--dare we say it--classics.</TE>
<TE>   "I'll meet these young designers who were barely born when we started
Emigre," says VanderLans. "It's very odd because we still sort of feel
like . . . we were sort of these rebels, and people who were cultural
aberrations, as Massimo Vignelli called it, so we've always felt like
this young group of designers. Obviously, we're not at all." VanderLans
utters this with a hearty laugh. Licko joins him. There's not a trace of
postmodern irony.</TE>
<TE>The Trucky Business of Selling Your 'Children'</TE>
<TE>   So how does this typography business work? Terribly efficiently and,
as it turns out, not well at all. Call it the digital dilemma. Time was,
back in so-called "hot metal" days, buying a font required installing
big, heavy, expensive Linotype machines to cast the type--not to mention
a big, throbbing composing room to assemble all of this weighty stuff
into a form that could be printed. Price of entry: steep. Stealing type?
Best done with a couple of semi-trucks.</TE>
<TE>   Fast-forward: Fonts are now arrays of ones and zeros; a two- or
three-minute download from a Web site or neatly compressed on a floppy
disc. Most font houses (Emigre included) sell a variety of licenses that
authorize use of the font on various computers and printers. An
individual user is usually authorized to use the font on two
computers--it's routine for a designer to send a copy of a font to a
printer. A single-user Emigre font sells for $39; the company also
packages families of fonts, or "collections," for up to $199. All things
considered, it's an amazing bargain.</TE>
<TE>   This freedom of access means that just about anyone with a computer
can acquire just about any font (and there are hundreds on the Web
offered for free). From the designer's point of view, this is both good
and bad.</TE>
<TE>   Fonts are "children," says Chester (who eschews a last name), a
designer at the Thirsttype foundry in suburban Chicago. "They really are.
You give birth to them, raise them for years and then they go out and,
like, hold up liquor stores."</TE>
<TE>   Typographer Jim Parkinson muses, "When you release a font, you don't
release it with an operator's manual."</TE>
<TE>   But type-manglers are hardly the font designer's biggest headache.
Those ones and zeros are infinitely reproducible. Piracy is, according to
Emigre's Rudy VanderLans, "a huge, huge problem. We have done our own
in-house, not very official research, [and] our findings are that one out
of every two fonts that we see in use is obtained illegally."</TE>
<TE>   Oddly enough, many of them turn up in design annuals. "You've got
professional designers who send in their work to these design annuals,"
says VanderLans, "and they win awards, and we see the work and we call
these people up and we say, 'Listen, congratulations on winning these
awards, but you're not registered to use our font.' I mean, we would be
very wealthy people if we had gotten paid for every font that's out there
in use. I kid you not."</TE>
<TE>   VanderLans and wife Zuzana Licko sue the perps if they don't buy a
license (Emigre's are the cheapest in the mainstream font business). They
say they've never lost a case. Sighs VanderLans: "And the lawyers are
laughing all the way to the bank.</TE>

<HD>The Plot Thickens</HD>
<DH>A Hancock Park Family Forgoes the Lawn for a Mission Garden Ripe
with Edibles and Ornamentals</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SUSAN HEEGER</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Something magical happened when Cindy Boyd and Louis Wilde stripped
the pink paint off their Mission-style house in Hancock Park. Suddenly,
instead of Hollywood's idea of a hilltop villa in Majorca, they saw the
plainness of La Purisima, one of the least adorned of California's
missions. While the wear and tear of 75 years showed clearly in the
finely cracked and pitted plaster, such flaws enhanced the character of
walls that now resembled old adobe. And once adobe was invoked, the
couple's hopes for a practical garden where they could tend vegetables
along with climbing roses made sense. "Mission gardens were basically
utilitarian," observes Wilde, an economist. "But their mix of edibles
with ornamentals appealed to us as a model."</LD>
<TE>   Four years ago, when he and Boyd, an artist, bought their
house--designed in 1923 by architect A.S. Nibecker Jr.--they loved the
purity of its original Batchelder tiles and wood floors. But the
landscape was another story. Possibly during the 1940s, someone had
planted podocarpus trees, some smack in front of windows, and snipped
them into topiaries. The front hill was a sea of lawn, which Boyd and
Wilde found dull, not to mention environmentally irresponsible. Along one
edge, a concrete drive shot from the street uphill to wrap unpleasantly
around the house, where it met more paving. Even a romantic courtyard
near the front door was floored with brick, which made it baking hot
during daylight hours. Boyd and Wilde cleaned the slate, banishing lawn,
bricks and goofy topiaries. They kept one struggling rose, a 'Cecile
Brunner' on the courtyard wall, and added a climbing 'Sally Holmes.'
Wilde, who spent his childhood in Iowa farm country and is the food
gardener of the pair, planted grapes in a side yard. Boyd, having grown
up amid Orange County citrus groves, wanted to frame the house with
orange trees. Like Wilde, she works largely from home and envisioned lush
views from indoors and secluded garden spots where she could wander and
relax. Both wanted their children, Max, 10, and Alexandra, 12, to enjoy
the bounties of nature.</TE>
<TE>   But given their demanding schedules, they asked Altadena landscape
designer Robert Cardenas to help them lay out their ideas. "We spent time
walking, looking at views and getting a sense of each space," says
Cardenas, adding that the house itself partly dictated the lay of outdoor
rooms. Off the kitchen, for example, it made sense to site a dining
terrace and surround it with herbs. The front courtyard, once it was
sheltered with palms and cooled by a reflecting pool, created a view
garden from the living room and a hidden alcove for lounging. Behind the
house, where the sun is strongest--and where the windows of Wilde's
office face garden--proved ideal for his food plots, now bursting with
tomatoes, zucchini and peppers.</TE>
<TE>   But the mission feeling is just as palpable on the front hill, where
orange trees blossom alongside specimen agaves and grasses seed among
boulders, adding an air of benign neglect. An allee of olives curtains
off the drive, which no longer continues past the house. In place of its
forbidding ribbon, Cardenas has threaded steppingstones through a newly
planted tropical glade, rustling with palms, ferns and jujube trees.</TE>
<TE>   "For me, exotics enhance a garden's sense of wonder," says Cardenas,
who went to out-of-the-way nurseries such as Mimosa in East L.A. seeking
mango, papaya and litchi nut trees.</TE>
<TE>   "It became a family game choosing from Robert's list," Wilde recalls.
" 'Do we want kiwis? Why not!' "</TE>
<TE>   Such curiosities hark back to early California history, when the state
was seen by East Coast transplants as a paradise where anything would
grow. Admittedly, says Cardenas, some are still experiments. "We're
waiting to see if it's hot enough for the papayas." Meanwhile, aside from
spring irises, courtyard roses and nodding lavender, you won't see many
flowers here. In this garden, beauty speaks softly, like the weathered
walls of an old house.</TE>

<HD>Virtual Meat</HD>
<DH>First They Put a Man on the Moon, Then They Took the Beef Out of
Burgers</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LEE GREEN</AU>
<BD>Lee Green is a freelance writer living in Ventura</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The past generation has certainly seen its share of scientific
achievements. The Internet. Radial keratotomy. The Bose Wave radio. But
the wonder of our time, hands down, has to be fake meat. Clearly the
world's finest scientific minds have been working not on cancer or
aerospace or the Human Genome Project, but on bogus burgers and faux
franks, or what industry insiders call "meat analogues." It's like a
peacetime version of the Manhattan Project. Almost overnight humankind
has acquired the ability to start with a soybean and end up with
something that for all the world looks, smells, feels and tastes like
Canadian bacon. That's like starting with a backhoe and ending up with a
reasonable likeness of David Hyde Pierce.</LD>
<LD>   Scoff though you may, fellow hunter-gatherers, I recently tried a
meatless pepperoni stick that would fool a USDA inspector. Using wheat,
yeast, the splendiferous soybean and other equally unmeatlike household
items such as beet-root powder, seaweed extracts and konjac flour, makers
have figured out how to concoct uncanny approximations of hot dogs,
hamburgers, cold cuts (bologna, turkey, ham, salami), ground round,
chicken nuggets--even chorizo. The packaging for a chorizo product called
Soyrizo notes that its meatless rendition of the popular Mexican sausage
lacks "the traditional salivary glands [and] lymph nodes." Now there's a
sacrifice I'm willing to make.</LD>
<TE>   I can smell you disbelievers out there. Years ago, you took a flier
and tried an early-version veggie burger, which tasted like a rosin bag
that Sandy Koufax left on the mound in 1966, and you haven't tried
another one since. Well, wake up and smell the isolated soy protein. The
world has changed since then. Garden burgers actually taste like burgers.
Or at least close enough for any carnivore interested in ingesting
considerably less fat, cholesterol, calories, preservatives and E. coli.
Ironically, while Gardenburger Inc. has improved its burger product and
expanded into other lines of meat mimicry, the company has seen its
market share sink due to beefed-up competition from companies such as
Yves Veggie Cuisine, Lightlife, Boca Foods and an assortment of other
meatless upstarts and start-ups.</TE>
<TE>   Vegetarian meat isn't just for vegans and PETA members anymore. I like
meat as much as the next guy, but it's nice to be able to satisfy at
least some of those atavistic desires with a hot dog that isn't the
nutritional equivalent of hazardous waste and hasn't been rendered by a
slaughterhouse. I think of meatless meat as just another weapon in the
dietary arsenal, an option in the same category as saltless salt,
sugarless sugar and butterless butter. Admittedly, not even the finest
meatless burgers can match a fat, juicy, chin-dribbling version of the
real thing. They bear a closer resemblance to those thin prefab patties
sold in bulk with sheets of waxed paper separating them, the sort of
thing you find at street fairs and charity picnics. Still, with the right
garnish and condiments, you've got yourself a modern-day miracle, and
nobody gets hurt.</TE>
<TE>Meatless Meatloaf</TE>
<TE>   Serves 6</TE>
<TE>   2 12-ounce packages of ground-round meat substitute, such as Lightlife
Gimme Lean Beef</TE>
<TE>   1 medium to large onion, diced or chopped</TE>
<TE>   2 cloves garlic, crushed</TE>
<TE>   2 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce</TE>
<TE>   2 tablespoons ketchup</TE>
<TE>   2 tablespoons prepared brown mustard</TE>
<TE>     Salt and pepper to taste</TE>
<TE>   Mix all ingredients together. Spread in lightly oiled 9-by-5-by-4-inch
loaf pan. Cook uncovered in 350-degree oven until done, about 45 minutes.
Serve hot with your favorite gravy.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The name of Mark Peel and Suzanne Tracht's new restaurant doesn't
give a thing away. It's called Jar. They aren't saying why. Does it refer
to jar the container or jar the verb? Whatever. It's a fat and round
sound, American and vernacular, which is what the food is like at this
in-the-moment American place.</LD>
<LD>   Peel owns Campanile with his wife, Nancy Silverton, and Tracht worked
as Peel's chef de cuisine there in the early '90s. The two had long
talked about doing a project together, and they had the name well before
the space at Harper Avenue and Beverly Boulevard (formerly Indochine, and
before that, Monkey Bar) became available last spring.</LD>
<TE>   With general manager Jason Lapin as a third partner, Jar opened in
early September, which might not have been the most auspicious time, but
as it happens, Jar's menu couldn't be more in sync with current events.
Just when everyone is looking for solace and conviviality, it offers the
comfort of the familiar--steaks, chops, red meat (and, it must be said,
some seafood, too), soothing starches and sides--with a modern gloss.
It's food that all of us understand and like. Nothing exotic or
challenging, just good products and smart cooking in a sleek, casual
setting. Needless to say, it has wide appeal. Campanile regulars are
there, along with Hancock Park matrons, the new generation's rat pack,
neighborhood folks and foodies-in-training. It may not be the place for a
first date, though. Unless you sit in the bar or the alcove set off by a
curved glass partition, the noise level makes intimate conversation a
chore.</TE>
<TE>   The design seems at odds with the food. With the restaurant half full,
which is not often the case, the room looks severe and uncomfortable. The
molded plastic Philippe Starck chairs are stylish, but they're not built
for the sort of people who regularly indulge in the hefty pork chop and
mashed potatoes on the menu. Color field paintings hanging on the back
wall help soften the bareness, but voices still bounce as sharply as an
NBA ball.</TE>
<TE>   Once the food comes, though, skies are blue. First out is a small
round loaf of La Brea Bakery bread, natch. Cut in wedges, it arrives on a
wooden board with a little French butter tub to keep you busy while you
peruse the menu.</TE>
<TE>   East Coasters will zero in on the Ipswich clams dusted with cornmeal
and fried to a gold crunch. They come with a haystack of thread-thin
fried potatoes in a bowl lined with a swatch of newsprint and with two
sauces swirled yin-yang style: a flamboyant red cocktail sauce and a
piquant tartar. French green bean and chanterelle salad is piled high and
fenced in with tender slices of pink Parma ham. The mustard seed
vinaigrette delivers enough flavor to take the edge off your appetite.</TE>
<TE>   Tracht's steamed black mussels is another first-class starter. She
plays the sweet, plump mussels against the earthy taste of leggy water
spinach, and serves the dish with a tiny sauce boat of sumptuous lobster
bearnaise and a dish of fennel salt. Her winter menu adds a wonderful
braised pork belly--with its almost sweet braising liquid and tender
pork--to the roster of first courses. You can also get something as
simple as a meaty lobster cocktail livened with a chile lime vinaigrette,
or a wedge of iceberg topped with a pungent blue cheese dressing.</TE>
<TE>   Tracht seems to have found her element here, because her cooking at
Jar is already much more focused and incisive than her Asian fusion at
Jozu, where she was opening chef. Honey fried quail, in fact, harks back
to that menu, with the addition of a buttermilk dipping sauce. It's one
of Jar's least successful dishes. I'd add to that the calamari salad,
which pairs bland calamari with a shrill vinaigrette.</TE>
<TE>   When it comes to main courses, what you read is what you
get--straightforward steaks, chops, scallops or broiled fish, and a
handful of braised and roasted items. Pot roast didn't dare show its face
on the aggressively upscale menus of the '90s. Here it's making a
comeback--juicy and fork tender, served in a splash of beefy broth. If
you want veggies, though, you'll have to turn to the sides section of the
menu. Oh, and don't forget the creamy horseradish sauce.</TE>
<TE>   Roasted chicken with lemon grass, which sounds rather plain, is
unexpectedly lovely. Light and dark meat are crisped to a deep gold,
decorated with fine curls of scallion and served in the bird's
lemon-grass-perfumed juices. As described, marinated skirt steak wouldn't
seem to have much glamour, but this is a slam dunk: much tastier than
many a pricier cut, charred rare (for tenderness) and sliced on the
diagonal. It's a cut you can really sink your teeth into.</TE>
<TE>   Porterhouse for two is sliced and reassembled around the bone. Ordered
charred, medium rare, it's cooked dead on. The same goes for the New York
on the bone. The veal New York (same cut as the steak) is a standout,
though, both for flavor and texture.</TE>
<TE>   Unless you're training for a sumo competition, some of the dishes can
be too much of a good thing. The shaggy braised pork shank is quite an
item to wrestle with on your own, and gets tiring quickly.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the sides are so delicious that I can imagine ordering a few
and having them as dinner. Tops are the pea tendrils, in a swooping
porcelain bowl, that taste like the color green. I love the rich potato
gratin, too, laced with leek and the Southern-style slow-cooked greens.
Creamed spinach is emerald leaves smoothed with the barest dab of cream.
French fries showered with garlic and parsley should keep the kid in any
of us quiet.</TE>
<TE>   Compared to Campanile's exciting wine list in its early days, Jar's is
disappointing. And with both Peel and Tracht having worked with Nancy
Silverton, it's surprising the desserts aren't drop-dead delicious.
Though things are looking up. Most desserts used to come from La Brea
Bakery, but, thankfully, now they're sent over from Campanile or made in
house.</TE>
<TE>   Best is the ice cream sundae, served with two pitchers of sauce--a
dark, syrupy chocolate and a buttery burnt sugar caramel, which I love.
Apple crisp and cheesecake are both pedestrian. The lamentable individual
lemon tart has been replaced by a wedge of lemon curd tart. If you note
double chocolate bread pudding on the menu, don't pass it up. Served in a
bowl with cream poured around it, it's as black as mud, very soft and
yielding, and intensely infused with chocolate.</TE>
<TE>   Jar's other weak point is service, which, if anything, is overzealous.
Water glasses are filled so often that diners threaten to float away. The
food sometimes comes from the kitchen so fast, you barely have time to
breathe   between courses. Yet when I ordered some of the intriguingly
named oysters from Chef's Creek one night, time passed and
passed--punctuated by reports that they would be out soon. I could
picture the kitchen frantically trying to find the oyster knives, or
someone inexperienced trying to wrench open the wretched shells. Nobody
minded, really, especially since the staff bridged the moment with a
little humor.</TE>
<TE>   Could it be that after L.A.'s infatuations with French bistro, Asian
fusion, Tuscan and Thai, American cuisine is the next new thing? And why
not, if it's cooked with as much affection and style as at Jar.</TE>

<HD>Chaplain's Status Has Life After Death</HD>
<DH>Legacy: NYFD's Mychal Judge, the first official victim of Sept. 11
World Trade Center attacks, is being honored by admirers from all walks
of life.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LARRY McSHANE</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK
</DL>
<LD>In his brown Franciscan robe or white firefighter's helmet, Mychal
Judge always seemed larger than life. Four months after becoming victim
No. 00001 of the World Trade Center attack, Father Mike appears larger
than death too.</LD>
<LD>   The white-haired Fire Department chaplain has emerged from the twisted
steel of the crumpled twin towers as a multipurpose icon, claimed as one
of their own by constituents throughout the city where he once walked in
leather sandals.</LD>
<LD>   The Fire Department? New York's Irish crowd? The brotherhood of
Alcoholics Anonymous? Surely, Mike Judge was one of theirs.</LD>
<TE>   The Catholic Church? And New York's gay community? Just as surely,
Mike Judge, a priest for 40 years, belonged to them.</TE>
<TE>   "Mychal Judge's heart was as big as New York, and there was room for
everybody," says Brendan Fay, a gay Irish activist and friend of the late
priest. "Everybody belonged."</TE>
<TE>   There are more tangible signs of his new status: a stretch of West
31st Street was named for Judge, along with a Hudson River ferry. Pope
John Paul II accepted the martyred chaplain's fire helmet from a
contingent of city firefighters in the Vatican.</TE>
<TE>   Judge's poster-sized portrait still stands inside the front door of
Engine Co. 1/Ladder Co. 24, his local firehouse. The Advocate, a national
gay magazine, put him on its cover as one of "our heroes."</TE>
<TE>   A book on his 68-year life is in the works, with talk of a possible
television movie.</TE>
<TE>   "He belonged to everybody, but each person thought he was theirs,"
says Malachy McCourt, the best-selling author and a Judge confederate for
nearly two decades.</TE>
<TE>   "That was the beauty of the man," McCourt continues. No one, he adds,
says "one negative thing about him. And I'm saying, 'C'mon! There must be
something.'</TE>
<TE>   "But there isn't."</TE>
<TE>   What would Judge make of his ascent into the role of man for all
seasons, of his praise from politicians and the pope?</TE>
<TE>   "He'd be howling with laughter," McCourt replies quickly. "And he
would put a stop to it if he could."</TE>
<TE>   It was about 8:50 a.m. on Sept. 11 when word reached West 31st Street
about the tragedy in lower Manhattan. The thick, black smoke was already
billowing skyward. At Engine Co. 1/Ladder Co. 24, the firefighters
climbed into their gear and headed downtown.</TE>
<TE>   Across the street at the Church of St. Francis of Assisi, Mychal Judge
did the same.</TE>
<TE>   The trip from the firehouse to the friars' residence is maybe two
dozen steps. It was a trip that Father Mike--as he was known among both
the homeless and the famous--made many times since becoming FDNY chaplain
in 1992.</TE>
<TE>   This morning, as thousands of New Yorkers ran for their lives toward
midtown, Judge jumped in his Fire Department car. With firefighter
Michael Weinberg at the wheel and the siren wailing, they sped downtown
toward the World Trade Center.</TE>
<TE>   He arrived at the burning 110-story towers, where Mayor Rudolph W.
Giuliani spotted him. "Pray for us," the mayor recalls saying.</TE>
<TE>   "I always do," Judge replied.</TE>
<TE>   The priest, a bottle of holy water in hand, went to work. Within
minutes, he was tending to Danny Suhr, a 16-year Fire Department veteran
killed by a body falling from the north tower.</TE>
<TE>   Judge removed his helmet to begin the last rites. His prayers ended
when he was mortally wounded by a falling chunk of debris.</TE>
<TE>   As word of the terrorist attack spread, a colleague from St. Francis
headed downtown--Father Brian Jordan, who had met Judge a quarter-century
earlier on the campus of Siena College in Loudonville, N.Y.</TE>
<TE>   It was Judge who had challenged Jordan about his vocation, inviting
the college senior to become a Franciscan. "Forget about being an unhappy
lawyer," Judge told him. "Become a happy priest."</TE>
<TE>   Now, standing in his Franciscan robe with all hell breaking loose
around him, Jordan heard that his mentor was gone.</TE>
<TE>   "The firefighters saw my brown habit," Jordan recalls. "And they came
up to me and said, 'Sorry about Father Mike.' And then I heard that
continuously--through the night, through the 12th and the 13th. . . .
From firefighters, police officers, emergency service workers, civilians,
volunteers."</TE>
<TE>   Five people carried Judge's limp body from ground zero to the altar of
a nearby church, where he was covered with a white sheet, his helmet and
badge placed on his chest. Later, he was brought back to the firehouse on
West 31st Street.</TE>
<TE>   His death certificate listed him as victim No. 00001--the first
official fatality of the World Trade Center attack.</TE>
<TE>   It was the perfect exit for Judge, his friends agreed. But it was just
the start of his second life, as one of his fellow priests observed at
Judge's funeral Mass.</TE>
<TE>   "I stand in front of you," Father Michael Duffy commented to much
laughter, "and honestly feel that the homilist at Mother Teresa's funeral
had it easier than I do."</TE>
<TE>   Judge would have appreciated Duffy's crack--they shared a dry Irish
wit. When the Brooklyn-born Judge actually met Mother Teresa during one
of her New York visits, he asked for spiritual advice, Jordan recalled.</TE>
<TE>   "Pray at least two hours a day," the saintly nun replied.</TE>
<TE>   "Yeah, I will," Judge replied. "But I gotta get to work, you know?"</TE>
<TE>   A typical response from the atypical priest. Judge even composed his
own prayer, a mix of piety and self-deprecation:</TE>
<TE>   "Lord, take me where you want me to go</TE>
<TE>   "Let me meet who you want me to meet</TE>
<TE>   "Tell me what you want me to say</TE>
<TE>   "And keep me out of your way."</TE>
<TE>   His vanity was a subject of mirth to his friends: "The first priest I
met who used hair spray," Jordan recalls with a wry smile.</TE>
<TE>   Even on Sept. 11, Duffy said in his eulogy, Judge removed his robe and
sandals, put on his uniform--and then paused "to comb and spray his
hair."</TE>
<TE>   He enjoyed the attention that went with his job as chaplain, embracing
photographers as fervently as parishioners. While a parish priest in New
Jersey, "we used to accuse him of paying The Bergen Record's reporter to
follow him around," Duffy remembered.</TE>
<TE>   Yet Judge didn't disappear when the flash bulbs stopped. His loyalty
was legendary, as was his generosity. He gave of both time and money; any
gifts that came his way were quickly redistributed to those in need.</TE>
<TE>   When police Officer Stephen McDonald was paralyzed by a thug's bullet
in 1986, Judge suddenly appeared. Over the years, he became a member of
McDonald's extended family, even accompanying the ex-cop on a pilgrimage
to Lourdes.</TE>
<TE>   When TWA Flight 800 went down in 1996, Judge became a familiar
presence among the family members mourning the lost passengers. They
became part of his ever-expanding parish.</TE>
<TE>   At a memorial for Judge, a Long Island woman told of her brother's
death during the early days of the AIDS epidemic. The local priests
refused to perform any service for the gay man. When Judge heard this, he
handled the service himself.</TE>
<TE>   It was one of his first forays into the gay community, but there would
be more. When the archdiocese barred the gay Catholic group Dignity from
its facilities, he helped arrange a temporary home at St. Francis for its
AIDS ministry.</TE>
<TE>   And when his friend Brendan Fay established a St. Patrick's Day parade
in Queens that permitted gays to march, Judge was among those walking in
March 2000.</TE>
<TE>   After Sept. 11, several of Judge's friends stated publicly that the
priest was gay--an issue of orientation rather than practice, given his
vow of chastity. But like so much of his life, it wasn't quite that
simple.</TE>
<TE>   "Father Judge was neither out nor closeted," one friend told The
Advocate, the national gay magazine. "He knew how to walk that fine
line."</TE>
<TE>   At Judge's Sept. 15 funeral, the many different people from the many
different aspects of his life came together in a single place. More than
2,000 filled the church; hundreds more stood outside.</TE>
<TE>   Fay remembers surveying the crowd with a measure of disbelief.</TE>
<TE>   "People from the political right and left," he recalled.
"Conservatives, liberals. People who wouldn't be caught dead in each
other's presence, sitting and sharing deep grief."</TE>
<TE>   So Mychal Judge is really gone. Yet for those who knew him, he can't
ever leave.</TE>
<TE>   A copy of Judge's prayer hangs above the desk of Father Jordan in his
basement office at the friary. McCourt will be out--visiting John Jay
College, stopping by the Irish consulate, or sitting in an AA
meeting--and his friend's visage will appear.</TE>
<TE>   There are living testaments: when Fire Commissioner Thomas Von Essen's
son welcomed a baby boy on Oct. 1, the child was named Mason Judge to
honor the priest. Another friend, Mychal McNicholas, changed the spelling
of his name from Michael after the tragedy.</TE>
<TE>   When Brendan Fay visits Madison Square Garden, he thinks of Judge. The
peripatetic priest landed the Irish immigrant his first-ever tickets to
an NBA game several years ago.</TE>
<TE>   The next time Fay heads to the Garden, he'll walk past the friary on
31st Street and take note of the street sign honoring his lost friend.</TE>
<TE>   "It will be a good thing, not a trivial political thing," Fay says.
"It will be a reminder, a recall, and a challenge to be like him."</TE>

<HD>Arkansas Prison Still Shackled to Dark Past</HD>
<DH>Law: The notorious Cummins Unit facility has taken strides for the
better, but the sins of the past 100 years are well documented.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MELISSA NELSON</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>VARNER, Ark.
</DL>
<LD>Guards on horseback still watch inmates toil in fields, harvesting
rice, cotton and corn from the rich, flat Delta land. Little seems to
have changed at the Cummins Unit prison, which turns 100 years old in
2002.</LD>
<LD>   These days, however, the guards are paid employees, not rifle-wielding
trusties spending the rest of their lives in a 10,000-acre prison, once
among the harshest in the nation. Punishment is meted out under strict
guidelines, not through bullwhips and electric-shock devices.</LD>
<LD>   Life has changed inside and outside the prison, where modern buildings
have replaced old wooden cellblock structures.</LD>
<TE>   "It looked like you were driving back in time to the 1800s," said
Kenneth Nicely, a convicted police killer who began serving a life term
in 1958.</TE>
<TE>   Inmates answered to few outsiders in the days before reforms.</TE>
<TE>   "There were only eight or nine free-world people over four barracks
with 160 people each," recalled Nicely, 63, a slight, gray-haired man
dressed in tattered white prison pajamas.</TE>
<TE>   Dina Tyler, spokeswoman for the Arkansas Department of Correction,
said prisoner oversight and awareness of human-rights abuses has improved
drastically in the state system, which now houses 12,300 inmates.</TE>
<TE>   Since 1970, she said, "there have been leaps forward."</TE>
<TE>   Back then, survival depended on inner strength and the ability to keep
up with work demands on the prison farm, Nicely said. For those who
couldn't do the work, punishment was harsh.</TE>
<TE>   "They would make you lie down on your stomach and whip you with a bull
hide. I got whipped the first day I was on the hoe squad," Nicely said.</TE>
<TE>   "It was like being backed up against a heating stove all day long. At
night, you couldn't pull your shorts off. You had to take a shower and
shake them loose," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Lucille Smith spent her first years of incarceration in a converted
chicken coop--back when men and women were held at separate areas on the
Cummins prison farm.</TE>
<TE>   "When we first pulled up, we thought it was a joke. It looked like an
old, run-down farmhouse with a fence around it that was waist-high," said
Smith, the longest-serving female inmate in the state prison system.</TE>
<TE>   Smith, also a convicted police killer, began her life sentence in
1974. She now is held at the McPherson Unit for women that opened in
Newport in 1998.</TE>
<TE>   "Your worst day here isn't as bad as your best day in Cummins," said
the 51-year-old.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. Supreme Court ruled in 1970 that the Arkansas prison system
violated the Constitution's prohibition of cruel and unusual punishment.
The prison remained under federal supervision for the next 13 years.</TE>
<TE>   A federal judge from the era declared the state prison system a "dark
and evil world." The prison system inspired Bobby Darin to write and
record the hit song "Long Line Rider," the nickname for the tough trusty
work supervisors, and it became the model for the 1980 Robert Redford
film "Brubaker."</TE>
<TE>   The state prison system was self-sufficient then, run in large part by
the trusties, who were supported by the proceeds of their crops.</TE>
<TE>   "It was the prevalent thing in all Southern prisons because it was
cost-saving," said Cummins warden Dale Reed. "Back in the '50s, the
thought was that prisons could turn a profit."</TE>
<TE>   Reed hired on as a guard in 1973 at age 18; his father also worked at
the penitentiary. A trusty trained Reed before Reed went to work
supervising 600 inmates.</TE>
<TE>   "The inmates [trusties] had most of the guns. They would be in the
fields overseeing the long lines of 150 to 200 inmates," he said. "Many
of those inmates had a reputation for being able to shoot a goose out of
the air with those rifles."</TE>
<TE>   Reed came at the end of an era, a time when inmates were slowly being
disarmed and the state was regaining control of the system.</TE>
<TE>   "In '69, they had taken the strap out of the picture and whippings
didn't happen when I got there," he said. "The mentality was different
back then. There was no due process, it would just happen on a whim."</TE>
<TE>   When Gov. Winthrop Rockefeller took office in 1967, he made prison
reform a priority, declaring the Cummins Unit "probably the most barbaric
prison system in the United States."</TE>
<TE>   A State Police investigation found brutality, extortion, murder,
sadism and fraud.</TE>
<TE>   As part of the reforms, Rockefeller commuted the death sentences of 14
death row inmates.</TE>
<TE>   His son, Winthrop Paul Rockefeller, now lieutenant governor, said his
father was motivated in part by the racial inequities within the system.</TE>
<TE>   "Back then, you would get the death sentence many times just for the
color of your skin," he said.</TE>
<TE>   When Rockefeller visited prisons, his bodyguard had to check his gun
with a prison trusty.</TE>
<TE>   "It didn't matter if they were with the sheriff's office, or a police
department or an armed gubernatorial bodyguard. Armed people [from the
outside] didn't go into the barracks" for fear unarmed inmates might try
to jump them and take their guns, said John Haley, who served on
Rockefeller's prison board and worked to reform the system.</TE>
<TE>   "In 1967, there were only 35 employees at Tucker and Cummins
combined," Haley said. "There were nearly 300 armed guards, all of whom
were inmates."</TE>
<TE>   Gov. Rockefeller brought in Thomas Murton to run the state prisons.
Focusing on rumors of a secret prison burial ground, Murton unearthed a
pauper's cemetery in front of television cameras.</TE>
<TE>   Inmate Samuel Billingsley, who entered Cummins in 1957, was among
those who watched the cemetery excavation. He said rumors of unmarked
graves had long circulated within the prison.</TE>
<TE>   "All the older guys, everybody, said a lot of inmates were buried in
there," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Murton's successor, Robert Sarver, continued the reforms, and their
legacy continues.</TE>
<TE>   "In the introduction to criminal-justice textbooks, when they get to
the corrections section, they always mention Tucker and Cummins and the
'dark and evil world' quote," said Arkansas Board of Correction
Chairperson Mary Parker. "Cummins particularly is the domino in prison
reform that everyone remembers."</TE>
<TE>   In his nearly 30 years as a prison system employee, Reed said he has
long fought the reputation of the Cummins Unit.</TE>
<TE>   "In 2002, we will have 100 years here, but people cling to the bad
things for a long time. It is hard to change the reputation of Cummins as
a dark and evil place, but one day we will get that reputation buried
somehow," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The prison, now accredited, suffered a setback last February, when a
federal grand jury indicted six former guards on charges they shocked and
tortured three Cummins inmates in 1998. Five pleaded guilty and the sixth
was convicted.</TE>
<TE>   Inmates are glad of most of the changes, but not all.</TE>
<TE>   "Back then, you didn't have to go to chow hall, they let you go
fishing instead. In the wintertime you could always catch a rabbit in the
cotton field," Billingsley said.</TE>
<TE>   And he said inmates often gambled, playing dice in their barracks.</TE>
<TE>   "I like to see the place change, but I would also like to see it go
back," Billingsley said. "We had a lot of fun back then. I didn't seem
like you were locked up at times."</TE>

<HD>Self-styled Macedonian 'Republic' Is Letting Freedom Ring</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KATARINA KRATOVAC</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>VEVCANI, Macedonia
</DL>
<LD>Their village is just a dot on the map, but the people here
consider it a country all its own: a self-proclaimed Balkan state that's
been defying authority for more than a decade.</LD>
<LD>   There's a lot of whimsy in applying the term "republic" to Vevcani, a
mountain hamlet tucked into the southwestern corner of Macedonia just
over the border from Albania.</LD>
<LD>   But nationhood of sorts is a state of mind for the 2,500 villagers,
who say their independent spirit helped them preserve the peace when much
of the rest of the Balkans disintegrated into bloody warfare in the
1990s.</LD>
<TE>   "We may seem radical in our ways, but we were determined not to let
anyone manipulate us," villager Nenad Batkovski said over coffee in
Macedonia's capital, Skopje, where he is Vevcani's self-styled consul.</TE>
<TE>   When the former Yugoslavia began breaking up in 1991, the village held
a referendum and 99% of the voters backed the creation of the "Republic
of Vevcani." The menfolk reportedly stashed guns and ammunition,
muttering warnings that they were to be left alone--or else.</TE>
<TE>   Macedonia, freshly independent from the former six-state Yugoslav
federation, ignored the strange village. Ten years later, outsiders still
don't know quite what to make of Vevcani.</TE>
<TE>   "They must be a bit touched in the head up in that village," said
Vlade Nikolovski, a law student from the nearby town of Struga. "But they
haven't harmed anyone, and if they want to do things their own way, why
not?"</TE>
<TE>   The village flaunts mock attributes of its "independence."</TE>
<TE>   It has a republican coat of arms--two harlequins dancing over a magic
caldron. It also issues red Vevcani passports and prints a currency, the
licnik, to hand out as a souvenir. But villagers don't use the bills as
legal tender, imprinting them with the word "specimen" to avoid breaking
Macedonia's currency laws.</TE>
<TE>   Every Jan. 14, on St. Vasilij Day, outsiders flock to Vevcani for its
greatest treat--the village carnival, a 1,300-year tradition with pagan
roots. As wacky as its hosts, the fete's highlight is political satire,
with masked villagers acting out current events.</TE>
<TE>   Vevcani first aroused attention in 1987, when communist authorities
wanted to pipe water from the village's springs to Struga.</TE>
<TE>   When villagers set up barricades, the government sent special police
to beat them, including women and children. Despite the clubbings, the
rebellion dragged on for weeks until the authorities finally backed off.</TE>
<TE>   "They branded us as traitors to hide their own failure," said Mayor
Vasil Radinovski, adding that the obstinacy of the village's Christian
Slavs commanded respect even from surrounding Slavic Muslim and ethnic
Albanian villages.</TE>
<TE>   "We launched a cultural revolution," Radinovski said. "Our Muslim
neighbors come in peace, to trade and sample our springs' healing
waters."</TE>
<TE>   Throughout the bitter fighting earlier this year between Macedonian
government forces and ethnic Albanian rebels fighting for greater rights
for their minority, there was no trouble between Vevcani and the
neighboring ethnic Albanian villages.</TE>
<TE>   That in itself is remarkable: Vevcani is a Christian village
surrounded by Muslim neighbors, often a recipe for disaster in the
ethnically tense Balkans.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, Vevcani thrives.</TE>
<TE>   Its steep cobblestone streets and neat, tightly packed houses--from
ancient red-brick tile buildings to brightly painted Western-style
houses--are a stark contrast to the impoverished villages that dot so
much of Macedonia.</TE>
<TE>   Nada Kocovska, a 35-year-old mother of two, married a man from Vevcani
14 years ago. She says she never regretted coming from the outside
because the "people are hard-working and determined to stay."</TE>
<TE>   Like his father before him and the rest of the village men, Ivica
Sekurkovski, 38, will teach his sons the compulsory craft--masonry. It
has made Vevcani men valued seasonal workers in places as far-flung as
Belgium and contributed to the village's prosperous economy.</TE>
<TE>   "They can be what they want once they grow up, but to mix cement and
build a good facade, this my sons must know," Sekurkovski said.</TE>

<HD>Car Theft Rings Are Hot Stuff in Japan</HD>
<DH>Crime: Gang members team up to deal the vehicles via networks in
Russia and Europe.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GARY SCHAEFER</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>TOKYO
</DL>
<LD>From a gas station attendant, the gangsters got access to the keys.
From a couple of Russians, they got a connection to perhaps the world's
biggest market for stolen Japanese cars.</LD>
<LD>   Before they were busted a few months ago, the gang in northern Japan
simply drove away with more than 100 sought-after sport-utility vehicles
using duplicate keys made by the crooked pump jockey.</LD>
<LD>   Their final destination: the Russian far east.</LD>
<TE>   Alliances between Japan's criminal syndicates and their foreign
counterparts have long troubled authorities here. Now they have even more
reason to worry--stolen cars smuggled out of Japan are showing up
everywhere from London to Lagos.</TE>
<TE>   After remaining flat for most of the decade, the number of cars
reported stolen in Japan jumped 20% in 1999 and 30% more in 2000, when a
record 56,205 vehicles were reported missing. Thefts for the first half
of 2001 were up 23% from a year earlier.</TE>
<TE>   "I see the numbers getting worse," said Sachio Kuroya, an official at
the National Police Agency that specializes in larceny cases. "These
people are organized and they have international connections."</TE>
<TE>   Thieves target Toyota Land Cruisers and Mitsubishi Pajeros--vehicles
popular in developing nations where roads are rough--and Japanese luxury
sedans with a high resale value.</TE>
<TE>   The best customers are Russian gangsters based on Sakhalin Island and
other remote regions near Japan's northern tip.</TE>
<TE>   But Russians are not the only ones interested in the illicit car
trade. Police have broken up auto theft rings involving Pakistanis, Sri
Lankans and Burmese.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities believe Asian brokers give the Japanese mob access to
black markets in the Middle East. From there, the cars make their way to
Europe and other parts of the world.</TE>
<TE>   In Britain, where Japanese right-hand-drive models are easiest to
sell--a trade group recently estimated that at least 1,000 stolen
vehicles, most of them Japanese, arrive every year via Dubai in the
Persian Gulf.</TE>
<TE>   Records of cars seized last year by Japanese customs officials show
that some were headed as far as Nigeria in West Africa.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities say they're cooperating more with their foreign
counterparts through Interpol. They're also using roadside cameras that
monitor the license plates of passing cars and drive-through X-ray
machines that let customs officials peek inside shipping containers.</TE>
<TE>   But nobody's talking about stopping the traffic--only slowing it.</TE>
<TE>   "It's impossible to check every car that comes through here," said
Setsu Sato, a customs inspector in the port of Yokohama. "We have to rely
on intuition and random inspections."</TE>
<TE>   Police don't publish comprehensive figures on theft losses, but the
problem is clearly growing.</TE>
<TE>   Insurance payouts to owners of stolen cars reached $443.6 million last
year, 17 times the bill a decade ago, according to the Marine and Fire
Insurance Assn. of Japan.</TE>
<TE>   Japan's 88,000 mobsters, known as yakuza, have dealt with Chinese
gangs for years, most prominently in trafficking guns, drugs and
prostitutes. More recently, they've been caught operating burglary rings
together.</TE>
<TE>   But analysts describe the car racket as a particularly attractive deal
for the yakuza and their foreign allies, and predict the ties created now
will lead to alliances in other kinds of crime.</TE>
<TE>   "They're trading a guaranteed supply of cars for a guaranteed market,"
said Atsushi Mizoguchi, an expert on the Japanese underworld. "I can see
more sophisticated rackets in the future," such as using the Internet.</TE>
<TE>   The Japanese government unwittingly made smuggling cars easier six
year ago when it eased inspection and documentation requirements for
exporters of used vehicles.</TE>
<TE>   But stealing cars has never been that hard.</TE>
<TE>   Few people in big Japanese cities have garages, and many cars lack
basic anti-theft equipment. Hot-wiring is not a required skill--about 40%
of cars taken have had the keys left in them. During the summer, thieves
hang around convenience stores waiting for customers who drive up and
leave their engines running to keep the air conditioning on.</TE>
<TE>   "The myth of Japan as a crime-free nation is an enduring one," said
Naoto Nakayama, an insurance association official.</TE>

<HD>Fledgling Rum Makers' Product Imbued With Tennessee Spirit</HD>
<DH>Business: The state's first new distillery in 50 years has found a
niche market smack dab in the middle of whiskey country.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BILL POOVEY</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>KELSO, Tenn.
</DL>
<LD>Far from the traditional image of rum making in the Caribbean,
where sugar cane is abundant and tourists sip fruity concoctions
decorated with paper umbrellas, Phil Prichard set up shop off in this
tiny town near the Alabama border.</LD>
<LD>   Just up the David Crockett Highway are yard signs selling country hams
and birdhouses. The only hint of any island is "bermuda hay." Locally
distilled rum is still quite a novelty here.</LD>
<LD>   The former Memphis marketing executive knew what he was up against
when he and lawyer Ray Jameson started Prichards' Fine Rum two years ago
and called their first batch "Fiery Gizzard," after a nearby creek
supposedly named by Crockett.</LD>
<TE>   "That was 100-proof aged rum that we kind of did our initial marketing
experiments with," said Prichard, 62, who now sells only a toned-down,
80-proof version.</TE>
<TE>   Prichard opened his distillery, the first new one in Tennessee in more
than 50 years, at the mostly empty Kelso Community Center, just down the
road from whiskey stalwarts Jack Daniels and George Dickel.</TE>
<TE>   He said he chose the Kelso community because it is in Lincoln County,
one of three Tennessee counties that allow distilleries.</TE>
<TE>   Prichard oversees production from a workshop he rents for $200 a month
at the community center, an old schoolhouse where dances are held every
Saturday night and voters cast ballots each election day.</TE>
<TE>   A tanker loaded with "Grade-A fancy" molasses from Louisiana sits
outside and connects by pipes to three huge fermenters where the rum is
made with Tennessee spring water in copper kettles.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike his Caribbean-island competitors, Prichard, believed to be the
only rum maker in the Southeast, sometimes has to worry about keeping his
molasses flowing during cold weather. When the temperature drops to the
mid-20s, the rum-making stops until it warms up again past the freezing
mark.</TE>
<TE>A Rum Unlike No Other</TE>
<TE>   And unlike some alcoholic beverages, including rums, that are sealed
in 53-gallon barrels, Prichard seals his liquor in 15-gallon charred oak
casks. The smaller oak casks give the rum a smoky flavor that Prichard
describes as unique and dry.</TE>
<TE>   With his wife, two sons and occasionally a few friends, Prichard
produces about 50 cases of rum each month to ship to stores in Tennessee,
Georgia and Arkansas. Starting next year, the rum, sold in a
750-milliliter bottle for about $30, will be sold in Alabama and most of
the Midwest.</TE>
<TE>   Jon Kell, spirit sales manager at Chattanooga-based Lookout Beverage,
said Tennessee is a "whiskey state," but drinkers like to support local
brands. So he sells Prichards' Fine Rum alongside Jack Daniels and George
Dickel.</TE>
<TE>   "It has only been here about seven months and it is doing well," Kell
said. "A lot of people still haven't found it yet."</TE>
<TE>   He said the Prichards' rum sets a new standard with a bourbon-like
flavor rather than the cognac overtone of most rums, and the rum makers'
timing in entering a primarily import market is good.</TE>
<TE>   Specialty rums have been increasingly popular, and drinkers are
"getting away from the bulk rums," Kell said. "They are moving away from
Bacardi."</TE>
<TE>   While some rum brands sell for $9 a bottle, Prichards' main
competitors are upscale rums like Cruzan and Myers, both made in the
Caribbean. Some brands cost up to $50.</TE>
<TE>   Few of Prichards' neighbors have really noticed the distillery.</TE>
<TE>   Linda Woods, whose great-grandfather settled in Kelso from Virginia
after the Revolutionary War, said she is surprised that there haven't
been complaints.</TE>
<TE>   "Most people are not aware that he is there," said Woods, a local
historian. "You still have a lot of people who don't support that. . . .
Maybe they are not quite getting the connection. People will say, 'Are
you aware there is a distillery in the Kelso school?' I think when you
say whiskey, you might hear from somebody."</TE>
<TE>Supposed Rivals Aren't Overly Concerned</TE>
<TE>   But Lincoln County Executive Officer Jerry Mansfield has high hopes
for Prichards' distillery--that it will expand, eventually providing jobs
and becoming a tourist attraction like the George Dickel and Jack Daniels
distilleries.</TE>
<TE>   Jack Daniels isn't worried about the competition. Roger E. Brashears
Jr., a spokesman for the 150-year-old distillery, said, "I don't think
there are any concerns on that here in Lynchburg.</TE>
<TE>   "The rum connoisseur and Tennessee whiskey connoisseur are two
different tastes."</TE>

<HD>Volunteers Watch Over Waterways</HD>
<DH>Environment: Growing corps of Pennsylvania senior citizens test
sediment, phosphate, nitrate and sulfate levels in 42 counties.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TIMOTHY D. MAY</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>HARRISBURG, Pa.
</DL>
<LD>They wade into cold streams with color-wheel gauges to test
phosphate, nitrate and sulfate levels. They scoop sediment from stream
beds, noting its color and smell.</LD>
<LD>   Citizen scientists, they call themselves, volunteers who keep watch
over Pennsylvania's waterways. Men like Jim Haney, a 67-year-old retired
environmental engineer from New Cumberland, and Bud Bankert, a
73-year-old retired biology teacher.</LD>
<LD>   About 1,000 senior citizens have enlisted in Pennsylvania's Senior
Environment Corps, a volunteer program launched in 1997 through an
agreement between the state departments of aging and environmental
protection and a Virginia-based nonprofit organization. And the number of
volunteers has grown steadily.</LD>
<TE>   Monitoring work is performed by 21 corps groups covering 42 of the
state's 67 counties. Their gauges measure conductivity, alkalinity and
acidity.</TE>
<TE>   The data are entered into an Internet database for use by state
environmental officials and members of watershed associations or county
conservation districts, or anyone else interested in the health of their
local streams or creeks.</TE>
<TE>   In the spring and fall, the volunteers conduct macroinvertebrate
inventories, using nets to catch aquatic bugs. They also examine stream
banks for erosion and, if they find anything unusual, report it
immediately to the state Department of Environmental Protection.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not just going out and picking a nice shady spot by a stream,"
Haney said. "We know a certain spot is important to DEP. Maybe there's a
pipe upstream and there's effluent that they're concerned about."</TE>
<TE>   The volunteer bug bit Bankert three years ago when he saw an
advertisement in a York newspaper seeking senior citizens to participate
in a water quality monitoring project. Bankert called his fishing buddy
Ernie Lauer, a retired Harley-Davidson engineer.</TE>
<TE>   Ever since, the men have been dedicated members of the group.</TE>
<TE>   "We decided it would be a good thing to be involved with, mainly
because most people don't realize how critical the water situation is
becoming," Bankert said. "The only way we can ensure we have good water
in the future is to keep monitoring it."</TE>
<TE>   The volunteer program has become a model for similar efforts in about
15 other states, including California, Oklahoma and New Hampshire, said
Tom Benjamin, president of the Environmental Alliance for Senior
Involvement, the nonprofit group that administers the program.</TE>
<TE>   The program is funded with about $300,000 in state grants, combined
with federal and private grants. State officials say it illustrates how
teamwork between individuals and government can benefit the environment.
Most of the money is used to train volunteers and provide them with test
kits and other light equipment needed to do their sampling.</TE>
<TE>   In Cumberland County, volunteers once found that the stream they had
gone to check had disappeared--into a sinkhole caused by construction.
They alerted environmental officials and the problem was corrected.</TE>
<TE>   In Philadelphia, a group working on a bacterial monitoring project in
Wissahickon Creek is helping determine whether the water is safe for
swimming.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a huge database of information that we wouldn't have otherwise,"
said Diane Wilson, coordinator of the environmental department's
volunteer monitoring programs. "These people are on reaches of streams
where nobody else goes."</TE>
<TE>   David Hess, environmental department secretary, regards the corps as a
kind of health insurance policy for state waterways.</TE>
<TE>   "Having 1,000 extra pairs of eyes is invaluable," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "There are 83,000 miles of waterways in Pennsylvania, and are we
hitting them all? No," said Beth Grove of the Environmental Alliance.
"But we're making one heck of a dent in them."</TE>

<LD>On the wall of Cindy Parseghian's office hangs a giant bulletin
board--a tribute to four children from a mother who once wasn't sure that
she wanted kids.</LD>
<LD>   There are photos of Michael, Christa and Marcia in their karate
uniforms, Ara at a high school dance. Greeting cards filled with quotes
about faith and will, a napkin with a scribbled message: "Love U More."</LD>
<LD>   Scattered through this precious window into a family's yesterdays are
the annual Christmas cards, always decorated with a photo of the children
and always signed "The Parseghian Family."</LD>
<TE>   Christmas 1996: A studio portrait of the four kids, snuggled close and
smiling big.</TE>
<TE>   Christmas 1998: Ara and his two sisters, one on each side planting a
kiss on his cheeks.</TE>
<TE>   Christmas 2000: Ara and the girls huddled around a tree, Christa on
big brother's lap.</TE>
<TE>   Cindy Parseghian smiles with pride as her eyes move across each photo,
each note, each memory.</TE>
<TE>   But the cards stop her, and her smile fades.</TE>
<TE>   "We're not doing a card this year," she mumbles. "It's just too
empty."</TE>
<TE>   Then it hits. There, scattered among the cards, are the obituaries.</TE>
<TE>   Michael, March 26, 1987-March 22, 1997: "He loved karate and cowboys
and Garth."</TE>
<TE>   Christa, April 12, 1991-October 23, 2001: "If love is for always, then
she is Christa."</TE>
<TE>   The year 2001 brought so much heartache to so many, and it brought
fresh misery to Cindy and Mike Parseghian, the son of legendary Notre
Dame football coach Ara Parseghian. They lost a second child to
Niemann-Pick C disease, while another continues to deteriorate.</TE>
<TE>   How does a couple survive three of their four children's being
stricken by a neurological disorder that eats away their bodies,
transforming them into invalids fed from tubes and incapable of speaking?</TE>
<TE>   How do you fight for a cure for others when it may come too late to
save your own?</TE>
<TE>   How do you go on with life when you are surrounded by impending death?</TE>
<TE>   But from their children's abbreviated lives, the Parseghians have
found joy even amid the agony, scientists have gleaned inspiration, and
strangers have been moved to open their hearts and give.</TE>
<TE>   It is an odd turn of events for two people who were going to be
professionals, not parents.</TE>
<TE>   In 1981, at age 26, Cindy Parseghian had her master's in business
administration and had been accepted into law school at Northwestern
University. Mike, then her husband of four years, was applying for
medical residencies with the goal of becoming an orthopedic surgeon.</TE>
<TE>   When Mike took an opening at the University of Arizona instead of
Northwestern, Cindy's plans for law school changed. So, eventually, did
her thoughts on parenthood.</TE>
<TE>   Three years later, she gave birth to her first child, Ara, and Cindy
knew immediately that she wanted more. Three more, to be precise.</TE>
<TE>   "I was just really overtaken with motherhood," she recalls. "There's a
connection with your child like none other in the world. You feel this
beating soul inside, and it never leaves you."</TE>
<TE>   With their dark hair and dark eyes, a mark of Mike's Armenian
heritage, the Parseghian kids were a striking bunch. They had beauty,
brains and spirit.</TE>
<TE>   Ara and then Michael, born three years later, took an early interest
in karate. Marcia, a year and a half behind Michael, began reading at age
4 and was the first in her dance class to skip and tie her shoes. She was
so smart, so tenacious, that Cindy dreamed of one day sending her to
Stanford.</TE>
<TE>   Christa, the baby, was everyone's little angel. With her cascading
tresses and dimpled smile, she was as adorable as a young Shirley Temple.
She even loved to tap dance.</TE>
<TE>   "I felt incredibly lucky," Cindy says. "We had these four beautiful
children, and our goal was to raise them to be happy, loving, caring
adults. I thought we were on top of the world."</TE>
<TE>   Then their world collapsed.</TE>
<TE>   They first saw the signs when Michael was in kindergarten. He couldn't
handle the monkey bars as well as other kids, and he was losing his
balance in karate class. His handwriting wasn't as legible.</TE>
<TE>   Cindy took him to a pediatrician, who dismissed the symptoms as
childhood clumsiness, and her concern as a mother's overprotection. She
and Mike knocked on more doors.</TE>
<TE>   An ophthalmologist noticed Michael couldn't raise his eyes without
also raising his head. Michael was sent to Columbia University for
another evaluation.</TE>
<TE>   "They took about a five-minute look at Michael and said, 'We think
it's Niemann-Pick C,"' says Cindy, who remembers they cited two telltale
symptoms: the eye movement and the fact that Michael had an enlarged
spleen.</TE>
<TE>   When Cindy and Mike heard the second symptom, they knew: Not one, but
three of their children might be dying. Marcia and Christa also had
enlarged spleens; doctors had thought that it ran in the family.</TE>
<TE>   In the summer of 1994, all four children were tested. All but Ara had
the disease. Michael was 7, Marcia 6 and Christa was just 3.</TE>
<TE>   Niemann-Pick C is an inherited disorder in which a variety of
substances fail to move around properly inside cells, especially nerve
cells in the brain. This improper distribution signals the brain cells to
die.</TE>
<TE>   At first, children seem clumsy. Then they have trouble speaking and
writing. As the disease progresses, most have seizures and suffer from a
condition that causes them to collapse if they laugh too hard.</TE>
<TE>   "There's a point where they cannot walk without assistance. They soon
are not able to walk even with help. Feeding tubes will have to be
applied," says Dr. Sherman Garver, an NP-C researcher at the University
of Arizona.</TE>
<TE>   There is no cure. About 500 children in the United States suffer from
NP-C. Most will die before age 15.</TE>
<TE>   The elder Ara Parseghian, who won two national championships at Notre
Dame as coach from 1964-74, has seen his grandchildren's decline during
visits over Christmas and spring break.</TE>
<TE>   "It's very hard," he says. "You envision Marcia and Christa going to
their first prom and being dressed for their dates, and ultimately being
married and having children. But it's not going to happen."</TE>
<TE>   Cindy says: "You scream and you yell and you cry and you curse God. I
can't imagine anyone doing anything different."</TE>
<TE>   But the Parseghians did do something different: They turned their
children's death sentence into a celebration of life. And they let their
children show them the way.</TE>
<TE>   "Our first response was: Let's take them out of school. Let's show
them the world," Cindy says. "Then we realized that's not what they want.
They wanted to be treated like other children, so we tried to make their
lives as normal as possible.</TE>
<TE>   "They had their own little hopes and dreams, and we tried to focus on
those."</TE>
<TE>   The children remained in school--always the regular class, even though
their learning curve slowed. They continued karate and dance, with
assistance from their teachers and fellow students. When Marcia couldn't
keep up with her peers in ballet, she joined her little sister's class.
She still takes lessons, with a friend holding her up as she dances.</TE>
<TE>   As their children lived life, Cindy and Mike searched for a cure.</TE>
<TE>   Using her father-in-law's name, her husband's medical connections and
her business acumen, Cindy had the Ara Parseghian Medical Research
Foundation operating two months after the children were diagnosed.</TE>
<TE>   Before the Parseghian Foundation, two labs were dedicated to NP-C
research.</TE>
<TE>   Today, there are more than 20, and the foundation raises more than $2
million a year toward the effort.</TE>
<TE>   "They single-handedly have pushed this whole field," says Dr. Michael
Parmacek, chief of cardiology at the University of Pennsylvania, who
heads the foundation's scientific advisory board.</TE>
<TE>   In 1997, scientists identified the gene responsible for causing NP-C,
but advances have been slow since because the gene's function was more
complicated than researchers anticipated.</TE>
<TE>   Until they know more, a cure will remain elusive.</TE>
<TE>   "There was a real hope and a real belief that we could find something
that could stem some of the horrible symptoms and give us enough time to
come up with a cure," Mike says. "The cure is still obtainable.
Unfortunately, it's taken longer than we ever hoped."</TE>
<TE>   Too long, they now know, for their children.</TE>
<TE>   Michael died of a seizure March 22, 1997, four days before his 10th
birthday. His death stunned the family; he had just started using a
wheelchair and his speech, while slow, could still be understood.</TE>
<TE>   That Christmas, Marcia asked Cindy to read her a book about what
children want to be when they grow up. Afterward, Marcia said: "I don't
think I'm gonna grow up," and she started to cry.</TE>
<TE>   When Christa took a turn for the worse this summer, the family
prepared themselves--and Marcia.</TE>
<TE>   In July, Christa suffered two seizures within five minutes. She
stopped eating, and doctors inserted a feeding tube. By fall, the
10-year-old needed a wheelchair full time. In October, she contracted
pneumonia.</TE>
<TE>   The Friday before she died, Christa spoke her last word. Cindy had
told her "I love--" and Christa put her hand on her mother's chest and
replied "you."</TE>
<TE>   When they knew there was little time left, Cindy and Mike put Christa
in their bed; Cindy painted her nails purple, Christa's favorite color,
and Marcia went in to see her sister.</TE>
<TE>   She sat on the bed, held her hand and kissed her. And when she died,
Cindy says, Marcia saw "there were a lot of people around, and it was a
restful death."</TE>
<TE>   On Nov. 21, a month after Christa died, Marcia turned 13. She lost her
speech two years ago. These days, she gives a thumbs up or thumbs down to
signal her likes and dislikes.</TE>
<TE>   She uses a wheelchair at school, although she can walk at home with
assistance.</TE>
<TE>   One thing is sure, says Cindy: "She very much understands that she has
the disease that took the life of her brother and sister."</TE>
<TE>   A year after Michael died, he came to Cindy in a dream. He gave her a
big hug and then was gone.</TE>
<TE>   "I remember waking up and having this wonderful feeling that my
children will always be a part of me," she says. "I feel lucky that I
spent so much time with my children, I'm sure more time than I would have
had they been normal. We have had a lot of great moments together."</TE>
<TE>   The Parseghians don't dwell on the what-ifs: What if they hadn't
fallen in love with someone who carried the same defective gene? What if
they'd never had children? What if they'd found a cure in time?</TE>
<TE>   Instead, they think of the smiles and laughs and recitals and
vacations--of all those great moments Cindy has captured on the bulletin
board in her office. They focus on Marcia and Ara, a high school senior
who hopes to be a writer or perhaps, like his father, a doctor.</TE>
<TE>   And sometimes, they remember the lyrics of a Garth Brooks song their
son Michael so loved. At those times, the what-ifs all wash away.</TE>
<TE>   And now I'm glad I didn't know</TE>
<TE>   the way it all would end, the way it all would go.</TE>
<TE>   Our lives are better left to chance.</TE>
<TE>   I could have missed the pain, but I'd have had to miss the dance.</TE>
<TE>   That, they wouldn't have missed for the world.</TE>

<HD>Concealed Gun Law Under Fire in Alaska Case</HD>
<DH>Courts: State rule that mental illness is no reason to deny someone
a permit raises safety fears. Gun rights activists say provision protects
rights of residents.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARY PEMBERTON</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>ANCHORAGE
</DL>
<LD>Judge Natalie Finn didn't hesitate to take away Timothy Wagner's
permit to carry a concealed handgun after hearing that he believes
there's a computer chip implanted in his head and that he's been injected
with deadly chemicals.</LD>
<LD>   But a state appeals court ruled recently that Finn erred. The court
declared that under Alaska law, mental illness by itself cannot be
considered in deciding fitness to carry a concealed weapon. And state
officials say they are trying to figure out how they could turn Wagner
down if he asks to have his permit returned.</LD>
<LD>   The case has caused a stir among some who say it demonstrates
excessive zeal by Alaska's Legislature to protect the right to bear arms.
Advocates of gun rights, however, contend that the state law could
prevent arbitrary government action against gun owners, and that
sufficient protections remain for the public.</LD>
<TE>   The case began Oct. 7, 1998, when Wagner entered the Alaska Mining &amp;
Diving store in Anchorage and an employee noticed that he was dripping
wet.</TE>
<TE>   Wagner told the clerk that he was wet because he was trying to soak
chemicals from his body before "they" killed him. He also said a computer
chip had been implanted in his head. Another employee overheard the
conversation and called police.</TE>
<TE>   An officer arrived and questioned Wagner outside the store. A
background check revealed that Wagner had a permit to carry a concealed
handgun, and the officer asked Wagner if he had a gun with him. Wagner
pointed to a briefcase next to him. In it was a loaded .357 handgun and
several bags of bullets.</TE>
<TE>   Alaska law requires permit holders who come in contact with police to
tell officers immediately if they are carrying a concealed gun. Wagner
was convicted of failing to do so.</TE>
<TE>   On Sept. 20, 1999, Finn sentenced Wagner to three years probation. She
ordered him not to possess guns during probation. And she ordered him to
forfeit his concealed-gun permit until his mental illness was "either
cured or improved." Based on her decision, the Department of Public
Safety later revoked Wagner's permit and denied his appeal of the action.</TE>
<TE>   A state appeals court upheld Wagner's conviction and sentence,
including the condition that he not carry a gun while on probation. But
it also ruled that Finn was wrong to take away his permit. The appellate
judges cited changes in the law enacted in 1998 that restricted the role
of mental illness in deciding whether someone was qualified for a
concealed gun permit.</TE>
<TE>   The law now requires Alaska applicants to disclose whether they have
ever been found mentally incompetent by a court or been committed to a
mental hospital. Those requirements were taken from the federal Gun
Control Act of 1968.</TE>
<TE>   But the old state law went beyond federal law. It also asked whether
the applicant was mentally ill or had been treated for mental illness in
the past five years. The 1998 change deleted those questions.</TE>
<TE>   "They weakened the law," said Nancy Hwa, spokeswoman for the Brady
Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence. "They are taking away the discretion of
local law enforcement to make these decisions in the best interest of
public safety."</TE>
<TE>   Dean Guaneli, Alaska's chief assistant attorney general, said the law
as it stands now flouts common sense.</TE>
<TE>   "In this case, the person is delusional," he said. "When you have
difficulty discerning reality from fantasy, that should bear on the
decision of whether to bear arms."</TE>
<TE>   Bob King, spokesman for Alaska Gov. Tony Knowles, said the case
realizes the fears that Knowles had in June 1997 when he vetoed the
Legislature's attempt to change the concealed gun law. Lawmakers overrode
the governor's veto and the bill became law in 1998.</TE>
<TE>   The governor said in a letter at the time: "I believe the bill sweeps
too broadly and as a result allows people who are potentially dangerous
to obtain or keep a permit to carry a concealed handgun. . . . People who
are mentally ill and under medication, although not formally
institutionalized, may obtain a permit."</TE>
<TE>   King said the state is obliged to follow the new law.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not sure there is anything the state can do at this point about
it," he said.</TE>
<TE>NRA Representative Dismisses Legal Issue</TE>
<TE>   But Brian Judy, the Alaska liaison for the National Rifle Assn., said
the case does not show any flaw in the gun law.</TE>
<TE>   The state is free to go to court, where a judge could declare Wagner
incompetent or commit him, Judy said.</TE>
<TE>   "The guy sounds, without a doubt, delusional," Judy said. "Now,
society, law enforcement, just about everybody knows about this guy."</TE>
<TE>   Joseph Nava, a firearms instructor and gun-rights advocate who lives
on NRA Lane in Fairbanks, agreed, saying the 1998 changes made
requirements for carrying a concealed gun clear.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't want to give the Department of Public Safety any discretion.
I want the rules to be black and white," Nava said.</TE>
<TE>   Republican state Sen. Lyda Green, who sponsored the 1998 law, said
Alaska law was changed to make it consistent with federal law. The
changes also reduced the likelihood that someone could unjustly smear a
gun owner with a claim of mental illness and cause that person to lose a
carry permit.</TE>
<TE>   The current law provides the state with an avenue for dealing with
Wagner, she said.</TE>
<TE>   "The court still has the ability to rule that 'You can't carry,' "
Green said. "Now, he should be adjudicated."</TE>
<TE>   Efforts by Associated Press to reach Wagner were unsuccessful.</TE>
<TE>   In the meantime, the Department of Public Safety is taking a
wait-and-see attitude. Wagner hasn't asked for his permit back and no
court has ordered it returned, said Del Smith, the department's deputy
commissioner.</TE>
<TE>Will Cross That Bridge When They Come to It</TE>
<TE>   If he asks, the department might be able to argue that Wagner can't
handle a gun safely, Smith said. The application does ask if the
applicant has a physical infirmity that would prevent the safe handling
of a handgun.</TE>
<TE>   "I think Finn was concerned about his behavior, and rightly so," Smith
said. "He made some pretty bizarre claims."</TE>
<TE>   The Department of Public Safety said it has issued 18,000 concealed
weapons permits since 1995.</TE>

<HD>Delicate Truce for Miners, Fossil Hounds</HD>
<DH>Coal: Unique Rockies deposits are rich with signs of ancient life,
and energy companies, preservationists share a stake in their future.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CATHERINE S. BLAKE</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>PRICE, Utah
</DL>
<LD>In this blue-collar mining town, the past meets the future in a
100-million-year-old layer of rock.</LD>
<LD>   For the last century, central Utah has staked its fortune on coal
mining. But buried within the coal are fossils--dinosaur tracks, fish,
bone fragments--that could be the building blocks for a thriving tourist
industry.</LD>
<LD>   Without the mines, these fossils would have gone undiscovered. But the
same machines that uncover the fossils with one stroke can destroy them
with the next.</LD>
<TE>   That has led groups that want to protect the fossils to pursue a
delicate truce with the coal companies and their miners.</TE>
<TE>   "Think how powerful the energy industry is. There is no way they are
going to stop a coal mine for a dinosaur bone," said Pam Miller,
assistant director at Price's Prehistoric Museum. "I've never heard
anyone speak out for preservation in coal mines. It's a can of worms no
one wants to get involved in."</TE>
<TE>   Newly elected Mayor Joe Piccolo said he doesn't see any conflict
between paleontologists chasing disappearing dinosaur remains and the
lucrative and established coal industry.</TE>
<TE>   Piccolo acknowledges coal's importance for Price's economy but said
attempts at diversification could make tourism a significant piece of the
town's future.</TE>
<TE>   "The [coal] market is strong now, and there is quite a resource still
underground here, but it's no longer the easy coal," he said. "I see a
strong future for tourism in this area. The dinosaurs found here are not
found anyplace else in the world."</TE>
<TE>   Price, population 8,200, is in the Wasatch Mountains on U. S. 6
between Provo and Moab. Coal's influence can be seen everywhere, from
trains rumbling through town around-the-clock to miner motifs adorning
the College of Eastern Utah and the Carbon County courthouse.</TE>
<TE>   Other old mining towns don't have to deal with any tension between
fossils and coal. Throughout most of the rest of the world, the rock that
contains coal is older or younger than dinosaurs, usually by millions of
years. But in Utah and Colorado, dinosaurs lived and died directly on top
of marshy bogs that nature hardened into coal about 100 million years
ago.</TE>
<TE>   "We have a problem in the West that doesn't exist anywhere else--not
the East, not in England," said Don Burge, director of the museum.</TE>
<TE>   He's been museum director for 40 years and, through patience and
cooperation, has built about 10% of the museum around dinosaur tracks
found in the roofs of coal mines. The footprints end up on top of coal
seams because the dinosaurs walked on land that became the coal.</TE>
<TE>   While dinosaur bones are still the museum's main draw, scientists say
tracks are important because they show how prehistoric creatures moved.
Could they run? Did their tails drag on the ground?</TE>
<TE>   When Burge wants a rare dinosaur track, he puts an ad in the local
newspaper appealing to coal miners who may have dug them out of the
mine's roofs to display in the backyard as mementos. He said he'd like to
see more attention paid to the dinosaur's history in the area, but he's
realistic about his chances.</TE>
<TE>   "Yes, they should be protected, but it's a logistical problem. How do
you inspect it? What agency wants to watch a coal mine?" Burge said while
standing beside a skeleton of a Utahraptor, a dinosaur genus he
discovered in 1991.</TE>
<TE>   "My question is, what happens if a tyrannosaurus rex is found in one
of these coal mines?" he said. "I think even if it was found on federal
property, they still wouldn't stop."</TE>
<TE>   So far, the relationship between preservationists and mines has been
amicable. Burge said applying pressure wouldn't get him anywhere. He has
worked hard to establish a positive rapport and, in turn, mines'
employees call if they find something baffling or potentially important.</TE>
<TE>   "You have to pay your dues," Burge said.</TE>
<TE>   Jack Hatch, a safety engineer for a mine owned by Canyon Fuel Co.,
said that seeing remains or footprints is so frequent, it's usually not
even worth noting.</TE>
<TE>   "Honestly, from day to day, we see so many of these things we just
continue mining coal. It's so ordinary that people don't pay a lot of
attention to it," he said.</TE>
<TE>   That lack of attention hasn't been a problem so far, according to
Laurie Bryant, regional paleontologist for the federal government.</TE>
<TE>   "We are aware of the tracks in coal mines, and there are probably a
large number of them, but honestly, we haven't gotten any requests to
study them in place or to open up an old mine," she said. "Our
understanding is that so far, there hasn't been a lot of interest."</TE>
<TE>   Bryant and others said the area is practically a graveyard of
prehistoric creatures, so paleontologists never go wanting for things to
study.</TE>
<TE>   However, many scientists don't know what they're missing in coal mines
because they aren't there, said Joanna Wright, assistant professor
specializing in dinosaur tracks at the University of Colorado in Denver.</TE>
<TE>   "It would be hard to have paleontologists on-site because they
couldn't be everywhere at once," she said. "The coal miners will make
sure you never know what's there. You have to work with them; if you
don't, they'll never tell you anything."</TE>

<HD>Hawaiian Expatriates Still Crave a Bit of Home</HD>
<DH>Lifestyles: Even after moving to the mainland, many natives of the
islands gather to re-create that 'Aloha Spirit.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DEBORAH KONG</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>SANTA CLARA, Calif.
</DL>
<LD>They fingered leis of fresh green leaves spiked with pink orchids,
savored kalua pork at the luau and swayed to the strumming of the
ukulele.</LD>
<LD>   Maui? No, Northern California.</LD>
<LD>   The 1990s brought waves of people who grew up in Hawaii to the
mainland. Like those at a recent music and culture festival in Santa
Clara, many try to keep in touch with their Hawaiian heritage--both in
concrete ways and at a deeper level.</LD>
<TE>   "We'll always be Hawaiian. That's our home, no matter where we are,"
said Tony Kwak, who was born in Oahu and now lives in Van Nuys. "It's a
state of mind."</TE>
<TE>   While Hawaii looks like paradise to many Americans, census estimates
say 99,371 more people moved out of the state than moved in from other
states from 1990 to 1999. (Hawaii's overall population edged up from 1.1
million to 1.2 million, however, partly because of the birth rate and
international immigration.)</TE>
<TE>   Among those who left, some wanted to escape an economic slowdown.
Others were searching for a lower cost of living. Still others just
wanted a change. The Hawaiian Islands may be beautiful, but they're all
by themselves.</TE>
<TE>   "You're just isolated. Wherever you look is the Pacific Ocean," said
Francis Li, 26, who moved to Northern California from Honolulu almost
three years ago, and attended the Santa Clara festival. "I wanted to see
something more than just Hawaii."</TE>
<TE>   Other transplants from Hawaii feel the same way. But whether they're
eating poi bagels in Central Park or giving hula lessons in Minnesota,
they also want to keep part of their home state with them.</TE>
<TE>   "When you get homesick, you want to experience stuff from home," said
Victor Lee, 26, who moved to San Jose from Oahu about nine months ago in
search of a technology job. "You don't get to eat food like this" away
from Hawaii, he said, devouring lomi salmon.</TE>
<TE>   Others say they, too, miss Hawaii's traditional foods and relaxed
attitude. What they miss most, however, is an intangible "Aloha spirit."</TE>
<TE>   Kwak and another friend from Oahu, Izzie Ramos, launched the
AlohaWorld Web site a few years ago as a home-away-from-home for
Hawaiians outside Hawaii. The site averages about 70,000 visitors a
month, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "There are many, many of us who have moved away from Hawaii," said
Kwak, an Internet technology professional.</TE>
<TE>   In Northern California, those craving the company of other
ex-Hawaiians also congregate at happy hour get-togethers.</TE>
<TE>   Two years ago, Dave Kozuki organized the first pau hana, a Hawaiian
term that loosely translates to "finish work." The list of people who
receive invitations to the events has grown to 1,800.</TE>
<TE>   "It's really good to be around people from Hawaii. You can relate,"
said Kozuki, who came to the Bay Area from Oahu about two years ago to
pursue a career in Silicon Valley. "Some people like to relax and talk
pidgin," an informal blend of languages, including English, Hawaiian,
Chinese and Japanese. "It's a lot more laid-back."</TE>
<TE>   Across the country, other former Hawaii residents have found ways of
staying connected to their culture.</TE>
<TE>   In New York, the Hawaii Cultural Foundation has held hula workshops
and ukulele classes, and hosted Hawaiian storytellers and spiritual
healers since 1997.</TE>
<TE>   In Seattle, Bill Nahalea hosts a new cable television show devoted to
Hawaii's news, history, music, culture, weather and sports.</TE>
<TE>   And in Las Vegas, Diane Ohata-Sims started the Aloha Pacific Festival
five years ago so her daughter, Kanani, 15, and son, Gerald, 33, wouldn't
lose touch with their Hawaiian heritage.</TE>
<TE>   "The only way to keep it alive is to instill in the young people the
values and the traditions," Oahu-born Ohata-Sims said.</TE>
<TE>   Many say they'd like to go back one day. "I'm a laid-back kind of
person. I don't like the fast-paced life of the city," said Aaron
Uyehara, 26, of Campbell, Calif. "I consider Hawaii home and I like to
try to keep my ties."</TE>

<HD>Sister Act Restoring Taoist Site</HD>
<DH>Heritage: The shrine, co-founded by an ancestor in the 19th
century, is a testament to Mendocino's vanished Chinese community.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MICHELLE LOCKE</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>MENDOCINO, Calif.
</DL>
<LD>Amid the quiet pastels of the coastal village of Mendocino, the
brilliantly red and green Kwan Tai Temple is as startling as a shout.</LD>
<LD>   Growing up next door to the temple, Loretta Hee McCoard used to feel
her feet dragging as she neared it--a gaudy reminder that the Hees were
different, the last remnant of a once-bustling rural Chinatown.</LD>
<LD>   As an adult, she sees the temple with new eyes.</LD>
<TE>   "There is this pride," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Recently, McCoard and sister Lorraine Hee-Chorley celebrated their
12-year campaign to restore the Taoist temple. It was a family promise
fulfilled, a vanished community honored: the Chinese who built railroads
and chopped timber before being driven out by discrimination and
unemployment.</TE>
<TE>   "We're survivors," Hee-Chorley said. "Our family has always had to
struggle, to fight for what we believe in. We just have never sat down
and died. And we've never let the community forget."</TE>
<TE>   Hee family history indicates that the Kwan Tai Temple was built in the
19th century, and one of the founders was the sisters' great-grandfather.
But all the other families from that time left, leaving only the Hees to
look after the simple, two-room structure dedicated to the Taoist
military god Kwan Tai.</TE>
<TE>   The family patriarch charged his daughter, Yip Lee, with taking care
of the temple, a duty she fulfilled even after her husband went back to
China, leaving her with 10 children.</TE>
<TE>   Yip Lee passed the obligation on to son George Hee, father of
Hee-Chorley and McCoard.</TE>
<TE>   The family faced prejudice on two fronts. Hee had defied convention by
marrying a white woman in the early 1940s; the couple had to go out of
the state to find a judge to perform the marriage. Hee-Chorley and
McCoard remember classmates taunting them with racist chants. Meanwhile,
their Chinese relatives were less than accepting.</TE>
<TE>   At times, the sisters wished that they were anywhere but Mendocino.</TE>
<TE>   A bluff-top collection of graceful Victorians used as a backdrop for
TV's "Murder She Wrote," Mendocino isn't known as an outpost of early
Asian immigration. But the Chinese had a presence here, as they did
throughout the state.</TE>
<TE>Chinese Brought Changes to State</TE>
<TE>   "The Chinese didn't just come to San Francisco," said Wendy Roberts, a
temple trustee who has researched the history of the North Coast Chinese
while raising money for the restoration.</TE>
<TE>   "They affected virtually every industry that helped to build this
state. They were involved in agriculture, railroads--customs that have
just gotten woven into the fabric of the state. You find evidence of
their presence in irrigation ditches up in Gold Country and then on the
redwood coast where there was logging and fishing."</TE>
<TE>   In boom times, the Chinese were tolerated as hard workers willing to
take on dangerous jobs. (A 1913 story in the Mendocino Beacon about
exhuming Chinese remains in a local cemetery for shipment back to China
notes, "It is a significant fact that all of the Chinese recently exhumed
have been victims of accidents, not one having died a natural death.")</TE>
<TE>   But when the economy soured, the Chinese proved convenient scapegoats,
says Lorraine Dong, professor of Asian American studies at San Francisco
State University and past president of the Chinese Historical Society of
America.</TE>
<TE>   "Chinese people were seen as unchristian, immoral and unassimilable,"
Dong said.</TE>
<TE>   Official records make little reference to the Chinese population, but
insurance maps from 1890 show Chinese herb shops, a laundry and "Chinese
shanties" in Mendocino.</TE>
<TE>   Only now do Chinese railroad workers get credit.</TE>
<TE>   "If it wasn't for the experience of the Chinese, when it came time to
building Tunnel No. 1, this railroad line would have only been about four
miles in length instead of 40," said Robert Jason Pinoli, who works for a
train tourist attraction.</TE>
<TE>   Pinched by discriminatory laws and unemployment, the Chinese left,
some going to China, some to big-city Chinatowns.</TE>
<TE>   Today, census data show 380 Chinese Americans living in Mendocino
County, less than half of 1% of the county population. Chinese Americans
make up about 3% of the statewide population and account for about 20% of
San Francisco residents.</TE>
<TE>   Roberts is sometimes stunned at how invisible the Chinese were when
they lived in Mendocino--and how quickly they were forgotten.</TE>
<TE>   "The temple is a way of making us look those Chinese in the eye for
the first time," Roberts said. "After all these years, we're finally
seeing it, seeing them."</TE>
<TE>   While other Chinese left Mendocino, the Hee family remained.</TE>
<TE>   About a dozen years ago, the Hee sisters turned to the job of
protecting the family legacy in earnest and got nonprofit status for the
temple.</TE>
<TE>   By then, it was showing its age. The foundation was going, a wall was
leaning.</TE>
<TE>   With the help of their brother, Wes Hee, and others in the community,
including Roberts, the sisters got a $5,000 grant from the National Trust
for Historic Preservation and an $85,000 grant from the California
Coastal Resources Agency.</TE>
<TE>Preparing to Open Their Doors</TE>
<TE>   That was enough for major repairs to the structure, but there's more
to be done; artifacts inside the building need preserving.</TE>
<TE>   This year, the sisters hope to have the temple open for visitors as
they continue to raise restoration money--and the profile of North Coast
Chinese.</TE>
<TE>   They're particularly pleased that local schoolchildren have been
researching and celebrating Mendocino's Chinese legacy.</TE>
<TE>   "History is not just about the nice stuff," Hee-Chorley said. "It's
about the bad stuff as well so that you don't repeat history."</TE>

<HD>Some Final Thoughts on the Mistmatched BCS Game</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JIM LITKE</AU>
<BD>Associated Press Sports Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Fog thick as soup clung stubbornly to the downtown skyline for a
few hours Friday morning.</LD>
<LD>   That made it the perfect getaway day for the suits who run the Bowl
Championship Series. Because anybody who was going to demand a refund was
going to have to do some detective work first.</LD>
<LD>   Miami coach Larry Coker, on the other hand, was easy to find. He
showed up promptly at 8 a.m. and took his seat behind a long table in a
hotel ballroom some 20 miles east of the Rose Bowl. He was flanked by two
of his stars, quarterback Ken Dorsey and receiver Andre Johnson, and just
about every national championship trophy available.</LD>
<TE>   "I don't know what all these are for," Coker beamed, "but apparently
there's no split national championship."</TE>
<TE>   No, but there's some questions regarding just about everything else in
college football, beginning with who's No. 2. That's what happens when
you turn the game over to computers.</TE>
<TE>   Counting Miami's 37-14 humiliation of Nebraska on Thursday night, the
BCS went 0-4 this season as matchmakers. A dating service with that
record would be lucky to be in business next month. Maybe that's why the
BCS founding fathers were in such a hurry to extend their contract with
college football's powers-that-be to the end of the 2005 season.</TE>
<TE>   The people who complained long and loud the last few weeks that the
Cornhuskers didn't deserve to be on the same field with Miami turned out
to be right.</TE>
<TE>   That was probably true for those who wanted one of the Fiesta Bowl
contestants, certainly Oregon and maybe even Colorado, there instead.
Plus those who questioned the wisdom of matching LSU and Illinois in the
Sugar Bowl and Florida and Maryland in the Orange. And maybe even those
who groaned last year when Miami was passed over by the BCS computers
that served up Florida State to last year's national champion, Oklahoma,
like some kind of sacrificial lamb.</TE>
<TE>   Maybe it's true that nobody could have given this year's Hurricanes
team a competitive game. Maybe Miami's All-American safety Ed Reed was
exactly right when he came off the field at the Rose Bowl and said,
"There's a lot of people saying they should be here. If they were, they
would have gotten the same treatment."</TE>
<TE>   Thanks to the BCS, the only thing we know for certain is that Nebraska
was not the right team to try.</TE>
<TE>   "This," Cornhusker coach Frank Solich said Thursday night, "was not
the match that everyone dreamed of."</TE>
<TE>   Solich was clearly tired of fronting for the BCS, of trying to defend
a system that used computer rankings to trump the rankings put out by the
all-too-human writers and coaches in the traditional polls. Those voters
wanted Oregon all along and whatever zeal he'd had at the start of the
process went pfffft --like air leaking out of a tire --during a 3-minute,
53-second span in the opening half, when the Hurricanes piled up 20
points.</TE>
<TE>   "Whether or not a matchup with anyone else would have been different,"
Solich admitted, "I don't know."</TE>
<TE>   Neither did Oregon coach Mike Bellotti.</TE>
<TE>   Thanks to the BCS, he didn't even get the chance to try.</TE>
<TE>   "The polls had us there," he said, "but the computers did not."</TE>
<TE>   When someone asked Coker late Thursday night whether he wanted to play
Oregon to settle any remaining doubts, he gave the kind of answer the BCS
guys could have scribbled on a note and handed to him:</TE>
<TE>   "Why? We're the national champions," Coker said. "It's settled. We
settled it tonight."</TE>
<TE>   Well, yes and no.</TE>
<TE>   Miami was a worthy champion, the only unbeaten major program in the
land and as undisputed a choice as you can have --this side of a playoff.</TE>
<TE>   Ever since the folks who run the BCS got hold of college football,
they've tinkered with the math until their heads hurt, kept their fingers
crossed so long they suffered cramps hoping they got they got the
matchups right, and then did more crowing over their handiwork than they
had a right to.</TE>
<TE>   But there are signs the paying customers are catching on.</TE>
<TE>   The last two years, the BCS has put together the wrong No. 1 vs. No. 2
game and increasingly marginalized all the other bowls. TV ratings for
the first three BCS games this season were down an average 20 percent
heading into the Rose Bowl, and it's hard to imagine that many people
sitting all the way through Miami-Nebraska.</TE>
<TE>   There are already promises to look into the process again, to possibly
tweak the factors used to determine the teams who qualify for the
national championship game. As if bamboozling the audience further is a
substitute for the playoffs most fans want.</TE>
<TE>   "The more often you have to change it," BCS chairman John Swofford
said the other day, "the tougher it is for the public to familiarize
itself with it and therefore totally accept it."</TE>
<TE>   Still wonder why fog seems to follow these guys around?</TE>

<HD>In Modern Era, Nobody Does It Better Than Rams</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BOB OATES</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>He might have been listening, or he might not--there's no way to
really know--but what I told him was, "I only want one thing for
Christmas. I want a guarantee signed, 'Santa' that the Rams will win
every playoff game this winter."</LD>
<LD>   Later, I thought I heard him say, "I'll help if I can, but I've never
been able to do a darn thing about turnovers, and to all a good night."</LD>
<LD>   They're special, the Rams. From the North Pole to St. Louis and
beyond, they have an upbeat effect on most sports fans. Sometimes
criticized as a finesse team, they're exactly that, of course. They don't
run through you. They go past you and over you. The Rams bust you not
with helmet hits but with what's inside those helmets, and that's what
makes them unique.</LD>
<TE>   Thus, many who watch football each week, no doubt, would vote to see a
Ram game if they had a vote. They like to see quarterback Kurt Warner
coolly pitching the ball around. And I'm with them--not that I'm a Ram
fan. If Warner loses the Super Bowl on a final-play turnover, fine. But
as long as he's still in there--with Coach Mike Martz sending in the
plays--this is one football team that's worth a sports fan's time.</TE>
<TE>BRAINPOWER TEAM</TE>
<TE>   A better word than finesse for a team like the Rams is, simply,
"smart." The Rams play brainpower football, which is the obverse of
smash-mouth football. And that's what upsets the smash-mouth coaches,
whose idea of the game is to line up a large running back behind large
blockers and run the ball off tackle. Repeatedly. But how much
intelligence does that take? Grade-school teams can do it--and do. As for
the pros, 25 or more of the 31 NFL coaches say football is a game of
running the ball and defending against the run. As strategic planning,
that's not only crude and deficient, it also guarantees sports fans an
afternoon of not much to see.</TE>
<TE>   Webster's defines finesse as "the ability to handle difficult
situations with skill and adroitness." That describes the Rams and their
coach.</TE>
<TE>SHUN BIG HITS</TE>
<TE>   One good way to play football wisely is to shun unnecessary hits. For
example, any time a receiver has gained more than enough for a first
down, it's smarter to step out of bounds than to try for one more yard by
heading into a defensive player. And Ram receivers are that well coached.
After gaining 10, 12 yards or more, they'll skip out of bounds--or even
dive to the ground--if the alternative is an unavoidable collision.</TE>
<TE>   Such avoidance moves annoy announcers who, like John Madden, insist
that running away from a hit is unprofessional because football is a
contact sport. In that analysis, however, Madden is wrong.</TE>
<TE>   The Rams' offensive team isn't in every position a finesse bunch. The
quarterback is a tough guy, the running back is tough, the blockers are
rough. But Ram receivers are mostly small, swift people who know that
every avoidable collision poses three unacceptable risks: It might end
the day for them. It might end their career. Most certain of all, every
hit takes something out of the man whacked.</TE>
<TE>   Even so, when a daring play on a crowded field is essential to keep a
key drive alive, Warner's receivers will all unhesitatingly lay out for
the ball. It's the avoidable hits they shun.</TE>
<TE>IT'S A BLEND</TE>
<TE>   The Ram way is a careful blend of finesse and appropriate toughness.
It's the finesse, though, that makes them different--and successful. That
could be as obvious in the Atlanta game today as it was in the
Indianapolis game last Sunday, when, during a 42-17 romp, Warner presided
over a four-touchdown second quarter.</TE>
<TE>   The Rams' toughness was most conspicuously evident when it became
necessary for their offensive line to blast some holes in the Colt
defense. Their blockers did that with force and strength.</TE>
<TE>   Still, on the game's key running plays, it wasn't Ram power that got
the first downs and touchdowns, it was the finesse moves and the speed
that Marshall Faulk brings as a running back.</TE>
<TE>THEY'RE DOMINANT</TE>
<TE>   The dominant team that some media critics pine for isn't years away,
it's right in front of them at Ram games this year.</TE>
<TE>   Many just don't recognize it. They equate dominance with physical
power and toughness--the kind of toughness that teams like Pittsburgh and
Green Bay formerly showed in their Super Bowl days.</TE>
<TE>   But dominance can be achieved just as surely the Ram way, with speed,
finesse, and unmatched strategy. If the Rams beat Atlanta today, they'll
finish the regular season as the only 14-2 team in football, and that's
dominant.</TE>
<TE>   It's also a fact that injuries are a ceaseless problem, but when the
Rams have all hands on board, they're No. 1 in the league on offense this
season, and No. 2 on defense.</TE>
<TE>   Nearly every week, they do the two big offensive things just right:
Martz figures out the opposing defenses correctly and Warner moves the
Rams up and down the field with the quickest reads and quickest passes
since Joe Namath.</TE>
<TE>   That prompts some turnovers, true, but coaches who worry about and
talk about turnovers are basically timid. Some don't know how to attack
defensive teams with well-thought out pass offenses and most lack the
nerve to throw a lot of passes because, as they say, passes mean
turnovers.</TE>
<TE>   The Rams understand that when you're throwing the ball, there are
going to be interceptions. That when you take hits that can't be avoided
to catch the ball on a crowded field, there are going to be fumbles.</TE>
<TE>PASS-RUN PLAYER</TE>
<TE>   The so-called trick plays, that some coaches disdain and the Rams
enjoy, have been some of their most effective. For one, there isn't a
better play in football than the halfback pass-run option. And the world
might never have seen a better halfback-option engineer than Az-Zahir
Hakim, who at 5-feet-10 and 182 pounds is also the fastest Ram receiver
and one of the league's best punt returners since Deion Sanders.</TE>
<TE>   The uniqueness of the Rams is, of course, in the speed that everybody
has when Martz sends in a lineup with, in effect, five receivers--Isaac
Bruce, Ricky Proehl, Torry Holt, Hakim and Faulk. The Hakim option merely
provides another weapon.</TE>
<TE>   When he moves inside to run or pass, Hakim lights more fear in the
opposition than Hall of Famers Paul Hornung or Frank Gifford used to.
He's a better passer than they were and, as a ballcarrier, much faster.</TE>
<TE>   The Rams haven't often used the Hakim option, although it really
should be in their game plan.</TE>
<TE>   One year when Green Bay was the NFL's dominant team, the Packers ran
Hornung on the option eight consecutive times from scrimmage, going 60
yards for a touchdown in Philadelphia.</TE>
<TE>   It would be fun to see what it would gain for the Rams if Martz called
the Hakim option on consecutive plays. Lately, however, Martz hasn't
often used unusual plays.</TE>

<KH>Q &amp; A VENTURA COUNTY DISTRICT ATTORNEY</KH>
<KH>Ron Bamieh</KH>
<HD>get headline from totten (same as totten)</HD>
<DH>For the first time in 24 years, Ventura County voters will pick a
new district attorney March 5. Vying for the seat are Greg Totten,
retiring Dist. Atty. Michael D. Bradbury's top aide, and fellow
prosecutor Ron Bamieh. These are highlights of interviews both candidates
had with The Times.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Question: Your critics say you are brash, ambitious and
self-centered. Are they right and how do your more aggressive tendencies
fit into the administrative role of district attorney?</LD>
<LD>   Bamieh: Well, you can have whatever opinion you have of me. I am a
very aggressive prosecutor, no doubt about it. I am tenacious. But what
you do in court is different from what you do as a person in your
everyday life. I am not a trial lawyer when I go home to my family, I am
not a trial lawyer when I am doing other tasks, whether it is working in
the community or doing something else. I think most people who know me in
everyday life, and know me well, would have different opinions.</LD>
<LD>   Q: What percentage of the lawyers, and employees overall, are racial
or ethnic minorities in your office? What steps would you take to make
the district attorney's office reflective of the entire community,
including the 33% of residents who are Latino?</LD>
<TE>   Bamieh: I'll talk about the attorneys. If [the number of minorities
is] over 10% to 15%, I'd be surprised. And if you go to management, it is
even lower. My personal opinion is we don't make a sincere effort to
recruit people. I am not an affirmative action person, but I do believe
it's important that the office does reflect some of the county that we
represent. Our biggest problem is that when we recruit, we don't recruit
in terms of what support would someone have if they came to our office.
Why would somebody of ethnic origin, who was ambitious, come to the
office? Then he looks at the management structure and thinks, wow, there
doesn't seem to be anybody of ethnic origin in the management. Why would
I think that I could achieve something big here? Now, the biggest thing
that I will do is I will make a sincere effort. The other thing is I am
going to ask the community to help us out. I would like to get a board of
community leaders and I would like to form what we call a retention
committee. Now what retention committees do, is they integrate the new
person into the community--social networks, make them part of the
community immediately so there is a support network in place. This would
be pretty simple to do.</TE>
<TE>   Q: The district attorney's case against local Hells Angels and their
associates is the most time-consuming and expensive in Ventura County
history, taking years and perhaps costing millions of dollars: Is it
worth the time and money?</TE>
<TE>   Bamieh: Well, first of all, to make it clear, I will comment as an
outsider because I have not been privy to the entire investigation. When
we go after a gang, you need to have a plan. Now, if the goal is to
eliminate the entire gang, can you do that? We have undertaken one of the
most ambitious projects going. I will tell you straight out, I don't
understand the prosecution theory behind that case. And I will tell you
why. When I run a case, if I am going to make a deal with an informant,
or if I am going to make an agreement, I do that prior to the indictment.
So to indict 50 people, as an example, and then make deals with 25--that
is not something I would approve as district attorney. Now if the goal
was to eliminate the gang which was selling drugs to children, I am all
for it. If the expense was great, I am all for it. But it must be
justified at the end of the day. And the public is going to hold them
accountable.</TE>
<TE>   Q: People's right to die at a time of their choosing has been upheld
by law in Oregon, but is now being challenged by the Bush administration.
Which position do you support?</TE>
<TE>   Bamieh: As district attorney your main job is to enforce the laws of
the Legislature. And when you start taking positions on controversial
issues like this, and you start taking them publicly, you immediately
call into question your ability to enforce the laws equally on both
sides. I would be troubled as district attorney doing such. You have a
responsibility, first and foremost, to enforce the laws equally.</TE>
<TE>   Q: Years ago, California took a step toward decriminalizing the use of
marijuana by making simple possession a misdemeanor offense. Is too
little or too much time now spent on marijuana violations?</TE>
<TE>   Bamieh: They created a huge problem because the federal government has
a different theory on that crime in this state. Now we have no man's
land. Is there too little or too much? Very little, I can tell you, right
now in our county is done in terms of possession cases of marijuana
because quite frankly there is little bang for your buck.</TE>
<TE>   Q: You both have worked for Dist. Atty. Mike Bradbury for a long time.
What would you say are his greatest strengths, his biggest shortcomings?</TE>
<TE>   Bamieh: I am here in Ventura County because Mike hired me, No. 1. And
I will always give him credit for that. His strengths are he is a strong
leader in this county and he is a great advocate for law enforcement. One
of his shortcomings, quite frankly, is that he has been in that position
for a long time. I disagree with him on taking political positions,
publicly, as district attorney. I'm not talking about the D.A.'s race,
but other races--when we have jurisdiction in terms of whether there are
any criminal violations in those races. I wouldn't do that.</TE>
<TE>   Q: A variety of studies have found that racial profiling by police
agencies is a problem. Do you believe it is practiced here and what would
you do as a prosecutor, if you saw a pattern of such profiling by local
police?</TE>
<TE>   Bamieh: What we have here is a dispute between the people in law
enforcement and the people who believe they are being racially profiled.
I can tell you straight out that I have talked to enough people who
believe it is going on where there has to be some credibility to the
argument. I've been out and all over this county. Eventually you have to
say there is something going on. The biggest issue, I think, is because
there is no communication between law enforcement and the public, the
community. I'll speak specifically of the district attorney's office now.
We don't do anything in terms of community outreach, really. The reason
why that is healthy to do is because then you have a public who looks at
law enforcement differently. We have to try to rectify this by doing
community policing, and letting the police officers be known in the
community so the community develops a different relationship with the
police officer. The more you have an interaction outside of a law
enforcement setting, in terms of working together as citizens to make our
community better, the less you have this issue occurring.</TE>
<TE>   Q: The state's three strikes law has been successfully challenged once
in federal court in a theft case where judges found the punishment was
too harsh for the crime. Much discretion is left to district attorneys in
using this law. Would you use it in cases where minor theft or burglary
constitutes the third felony strike?</TE>
<TE>   Bamieh: As district attorney your discretion in terms of what you file
and how you file should always be based on what's best for the community
and the protection of the community. You have to understand the basic
premises behind three strikes. If a person has a number of very violent
assaults, very violent sexual offenses, I would go after them on the
third strike. If the background is different, where property crimes have
constituted the strikes, I have a different view. The discretion is not
only with the district attorney, by the way. It's also with the courts
because the district attorney is just one level.</TE>
<TE>   Q: The district attorney's office has been criticized for failing to
follow basic ethical standards in a case, prosecuted by you, where an
unsophisticated crime witness thought she had been promised immunity for
her testimony but is now being prosecuted for murder. Does the D.A.'s
office press so hard for convictions that fairness is lost?</TE>
<TE>   Bamieh: Well, let me address this because you've addressed a personal
issue to me. And I will say straight out that, No. 1, everything we did
in that case was ethical and proper. My disappointment, if anything, in
that case is the way our office chose to handle it. I disagree
completely. I say to my opponent in this race, I tell him straight out--I
said we should cut her some kind of deal. I was told no . . . . There is
no doubt in my mind that everything we did was above board and proper,
and out in the open. It is on tape. And legally, I think we are going to
be fine.</TE>
<TE>   Q: The district attorney's office has repeatedly had problems working
with local police agencies on cases. There also have been conflicts with
some federal agencies. How can this problem be corrected?</TE>
<TE>   Bamieh: Well, law enforcement agencies protect their turf. You can
work very successfully with the various agencies in our county, but you
have to be open and you have to tell them what you are doing. What I see
causes it is lack of communication. I think it is very important for our
office when we get into a case to be very clear on what everybody's role
is and get that agreement first. Because the case is much more difficult
when you don't have that agreement.</TE>
<TE>   Q: Your race promises to be one of the most expensive in county
history, with lots of out-of-county money coming in. Do you favor any
kind of spending restrictions? If so, what?</TE>
<TE>   Bamieh: I guess the simple answer is no to spending restrictions. The
thing about campaigns is that it's all public. It's not like there is
money being funneled in or something like that from somebody that nobody
would know about. Every campaign has their resources and the campaign
that uses their resources best runs the more effective campaign. That's
part of the challenge.</TE>

<KH>Q &amp; A / VENTURA COUNTY DISTRICT ATTORNEY</KH>
<KH>Greg Totten</KH>
<HD>2 Prosecutors Outline Visions for Office</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Question: Your critics say that you're a bland bureaucrat with
little prosecutorial experience. Are they right and do these managerial
qualities fit into the role of an aggressive district attorney?</LD>
<LD>   Totten: I don't know which critics you're talking about, because
people who know me, the people whose respect and trust and support I've
earned, view me as a proven leader. Somebody with extensive trial
experience and a person who not only possesses the trial experience but
also has served in a leadership capacity for many years. I'm the No. 2
person in the office and oversee a $47-million budget and 600 employees.
But, beyond that, I've proven myself time and again in court.</LD>
<LD>   Q: What percentage of the lawyers and employees overall are racial or
ethnic minorities in your office? What steps would you take to make the
district attorney's office reflective of the entire community, including
the 33% of residents who are Latino?</LD>
<TE>   Totten: I don't have the percentages at my fingertips. First of all, I
am committed to making the office more diverse. I don't believe that we
are diverse enough. I want the office more diverse at all levels, not
just support staff, not just the bureau of investigation, but the
attorneys as well and, most importantly, management. I have a personal
interest in this issue. My wife is Hispanic and therefore my daughter is
a minority. And I will make us more diverse by reaching out to the
community, by involving the community in the recruitment and hiring
process and by reaching out to bar associations such as the Mexican
American Bar Assn. I've already asked them if they will supply a
representative of that group on our oral boards for attorney positions
and we will reach out to the John M. Langston Bar Assn. that represents
African American employers and ask them to be involved as well.</TE>
<TE>   Q: The district attorney's case against local Hell's Angels and their
associates is the most time-consuming and expensive in Ventura County
history, taking years and perhaps costing millions of dollars. Is it
worth the time and money?</TE>
<TE>   Totten: Absolutely. These people were responsible for selling drugs to
our children in public schools at various locations throughout this
county. They have been a scourge on this community for decades and I
think this case is going to wind up being one of the proudest moments of
this office's history. We do not believe in bargain basement justice in
this county and we did the right thing going after them, along with the
Sheriff's Department and Ventura Police Department.</TE>
<TE>   Q: People's right to die at a time of their choosing has been upheld
by law in Oregon, but is now being challenged by the Bush administration.
Which position do you support?</TE>
<TE>   Totten: I do not support the right to die. My position is based upon
my faith. However, as district attorney, I am charged with the
responsibility of enforcing the law. Whatever that law may be. Regardless
of whether or not I personally agree. To date here in California, we do
not permit right to die.</TE>
<TE>   Q: Years ago California took a step toward decriminalizing the use of
marijuana by making simple possession a misdemeanor offense. Is too
little or too much time now spent on investigating and prosecuting
marijuana violations?</TE>
<TE>   Totten: Proposition 215 unfortunately was very inartfully and very
poorly drafted. It didn't give us clearly defined standards as to what
amounts were appropriate for medicinal amounts and what amounts were not.
I believe marijuana should continue to be a controlled substance. What
needs to be done is change the law to set specific guidelines for law
enforcement to use in administering it. Somebody who is possessing 25 or
30 kilos of marijuana has got far more than they need for medicinal use,
and we need express guidelines that everyone can rely upon. Not just law
enforcement, but the medical users themselves.</TE>
<TE>   Q: You've worked for Dist. Atty. Mike Bradbury for a long time. What
would you say are his greatest strengths and his biggest shortcomings?</TE>
<TE>   Totten: I think that his greatest strengths are that he has
consistently tried to administer an office that is committed to doing
what is right as opposed to what is politically expedient. Having worked
with Mike I have seen him repeatedly make decisions that are not in his
political best interest, but are the right thing to do. In terms of his
shortcomings, I think that Mike sometimes makes decisions too quickly. He
has a less open style of management than I do and I think he's been more
involved in political activities outside the office than I would be.</TE>
<TE>   Q: A variety of studies have found that racial profiling by police
agencies is a problem. Do you believe it is practiced here and what would
you do as a prosecutor if you saw a pattern of such profiling by local
police?</TE>
<TE>   Totten: As far as racial profiling is concerned, I know there have
been some notable cases that have caused concern and I believe law
enforcement is trying to address those issues in a very responsible way
through training and education of officers. This is a great county with
great police officers. No clear case has been presented to us. We
actually did a study on our own where we did a random survey of cases to
see if there was any evidence of racial profiling across the spectrum of
law enforcement agencies and could find none. No case has been submitted
to us of clear racial profiling.</TE>
<TE>   Q: The state's three strikes law has been successfully challenged in
federal court in one theft case where judges found the punishment was too
harsh for the crime. Much discretion is left to district attorneys in
using this law. Would you use it in cases where minor theft or burglary
constitutes the third felony strike?</TE>
<TE>   Totten: I think every case has to be evaluated on its own merits. It
is a law that is a tremendous tool for us. But it has to be a law that is
administered fairly and appropriately. One of the things we do is look
very carefully at the person's background and the current crime. If the
defendant has a background of serious and recent violence, we do not
strike priors. Typically where the new charges are a minor offense, we
do, under our existing procedures, strike the priors. But if we have
somebody who presents a threat to the community we will not strike priors
and I will continue that practice.</TE>
<TE>   Q: The district attorney's office has been criticized for failing to
follow basic ethical standards in a case overseen by you where an
unsophisticated crime witness thought she had been promised immunity for
her testimony, but is now being prosecuted for murder. Does your office
press so hard for convictions that fairness is lost?</TE>
<TE>   Totten: Never. I was not directly involved in that case and had no
significant decision-making role in that case. This is a case that,
because of my opponent's conduct, the attorney general has had to take
over. If we don't have character as an office, if we don't have
integrity, if we don't constantly strive to do what is right, we are no
better than the crooks we prosecute. There are serious allegations being
made by defense counsel in this case against Mr. Bamieh and I think they
will be an issue in this race.</TE>
<TE>   Q: The district attorney's office has repeatedly had problems working
with local police agencies on cases. There also have been conflicts with
some federal agencies. How can this problem be corrected?</TE>
<TE>   Totten: First of all, I've always had great relations with law
enforcement and I think that's why again I've earned the trust, respect
and support of every police chief and the sheriff in Ventura County. The
nature of the relationship between a district attorney and a law
enforcement agency is such that there will be times when there are
conflicts. From time to time we have to review criminal allegations
against police officers. We are charged with the responsibility of being
an independent agency and reviewing police shootings. These are things
that understandably create tension. As district attorney, I am always
going to discharge my responsibilities in a fair and ethical way, even
where that may not be something the law enforcement agency is happy
about. At the same time, I am going to work very hard to have a good
relationship with law enforcement, so that we serve the communities we
represent effectively.</TE>
<TE>   Q: Your race promises to be one of the most expensive in county
history, with lots of out-of-county money coming in. Do you favor any
kind of spending restrictions? If so, what?</TE>
<TE>   Totten: I'm glad you asked this question because at a forum several
months ago I proposed to Mr. Bamieh that we would set spending limits and
he out-of-hand rejected that proposal. Again, I've worked very hard for
20 years serving this community and as a result of that I've earned the
support I have. People trust and respect me. Those are things that money
cannot buy. My opponent will probably outspend me by a factor of 5 to 1.
He is trying to buy this office with his father's money. I don't believe
justice is for sale in Ventura County. I aim to win this race. I will
spend substantially less than he does. And I am very confident in the
electorate here in Ventura County. They are smart. I am seeking this
office because I want to serve first and foremost. I am not seeking this
office as a stepping stone to higher office. I'm not trying to buy it. I
am trying to serve my community. And I think money will be an issue, and
I'm disappointed in my opponent not being willing to set spending limits.</TE>

<HD>Meiners Oaks Taxidermist's Work Is More Than Skin Deep</HD>
<DH>Business: Chuck Testa insists his craft is worthy of being called
art. Bears, boars and other animals are stretched over forms, not
stuffed.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID KELLY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Chuck Testa whisked the fox hide into his house, dropping it snout
first into the kitchen sink.</LD>
<LD>   "I hope my wife doesn't see this," he said, glancing warily toward the
door as he rolled up his sleeves and vigorously began to shampoo the
floppy hide.</LD>
<LD>   But when he struggled to stretch it over a foam model of a fox, it
didn't quite fit. "I call it the last great act of defiance," muttered
Testa.</LD>
<TE>   In the Ojai Valley, where eccentricity and creativity flourish, Testa
wants to be taken seriously as an artist, something akin to a sculptor.
As a taxidermist, he aims to take dead animals and infuse them with the
illusion of life, vitality--even a bit of defiance.</TE>
<TE>   Slide open the door of Testa's Meiners Oaks shop and a glassy-eyed
menagerie of snarling bears, prowling lions and shaggy bison glare back.</TE>
<TE>   His workshop has an enormous Cape buffalo from Africa, a golden lion
and a majestic eland that stands 9 feet tall. There are also wild boars,
bears and pythons. But he doesn't do fish, and he's not wild about
reptiles.</TE>
<TE>   Testa bristles at those who suggest his animals are "stuffed." They
aren't. In fact, they're usually just hides. Taxidermy supply businesses
sell models--called mannikins--of pretty much any animal that crawls,
flies or swims. The hides usually fit over the models like gloves.</TE>
<TE>   "You have your art supplies like any other artist," said Testa, 45,
who was born and raised in the Ojai Valley.</TE>
<TE>   His supplies include a drawer of glass eyes, artificial snouts and
several sets of false teeth for merino sheep.</TE>
<TE>He Strives to Create An Authentic Look</TE>
<TE>   Before it's done, this fox will get new eyes and new teeth. Its paws
will be painted and buffed. A duck--shot in Alaska along with the
fox--will be inserted into its mouth and a natural background will be
created. The bullet holes will be sewn over.</TE>
<TE>   "Getting the expression and eyes right are the hardest part," said
Testa, as he studied a fox face in a magazine. "You need just the right
attitude."</TE>
<TE>   While his ultimate goal is authenticity, he's sometimes asked to add a
little drama.</TE>
<TE>   "I put a snarl on this bear because the client wanted it to look more
ferocious," he said, patting the nose of a large black bear staring over
his workbench. "I like to mount my pieces as natural as possible. It's an
art form to me. I want to see it walk off the table."</TE>
<TE>   Some hunters ask him to somehow make the animal look larger.</TE>
<TE>   "I tell them to go shoot a bigger deer," Testa said.</TE>
<TE>   Taxidermy has come a long way since the days when animals were in fact
stuffed with straw and stretched over chicken wire or wood. The words
"taxis" and "derma" are Greek for "movement" and "skin"--or moving skins.</TE>
<TE>   There is a National Assn. of Taxidermists, and each state has its own
local chapter. There are also international, national and regional
competitions. The Western State's Taxidermy Championships are held each
year in Redding.</TE>
<TE>   "I think there is a concerted effort by the industry itself to make it
more accepted as art," said Tony Finazzo, president of the California
Taxidermy Assn. "The overall quality of the work is much better. You are
in a competition, not just with other artists, but with animals in
nature. You use good composition and balance and present it as an art
piece, as a kind of painting rather than a stuffed bird on a piece of
driftwood."</TE>
<TE>   Finazzo, of San Bernardino, has won three first-place prizes in
national competitions and is deemed a "master taxidermist" by the
national group.</TE>
<TE>   Gerd Koch, program director of the Studio Channel Islands Art Center
on the campus of Cal State Channel Islands, said taxidermists can indeed
be artists.</TE>
<TE>   "There are always people in any creative endeavor who transcend their
limitations and take things into another realm," said Koch. "They are
showing these creatures' lifestyles. The tableau or background they
create is another thing, particularly if they take a unique approach to
it. It can be an extremely beautiful and profound experience."</TE>
<TE>   The backdrops can be as simple as a rock or as complex as a forest,
desert or mountain environment.</TE>
<TE>Doing Everything by the Book</TE>
<TE>   When a hunter brings him an animal hide, Testa records his license,
where the animal was shot and any permits that were needed. His books are
subject to audit by state fish and wildlife officers.</TE>
<TE>   The hide is then tanned, washed, salted and degreased. It's pulled
over a mannikin and sewn up by hand. Props are inserted under the ears to
make them stand up. Eyes and teeth are put in, and eyelids are created of
clay. Often the pelts and noses must be painted.</TE>
<TE>   It could take up to a year to mount a large bear and create its
woodland backdrop.</TE>
<TE>   Young animals often have smoother pelts and less scarring. "You are
bound by nature," Testa said. "Some animals are just ugly and some are
exceptionally good looking. Coyotes are the worst. They are greasy and
they stink."</TE>
<TE>   Testa, who supports hunting but doesn't hunt himself, said the number
of people shooting animals in countries like Tanzania has grown, and he
is getting more exotic wildlife to mount. His clients, he said, come from
all over Southern California. He's also done animals for natural history
museums.</TE>
<TE>   The work is time-consuming, and finishing a job can take months. He
will charge about $800 for the mounted fox. Bears, lions and buffalo can
go for $8,000 or more.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a tough way to make a living," he said. "But you get to make
something come back to life. I'm like any other artist. I could probably
make more money doing something else, but I keep on doing what I love."</TE>

<LD>A 17-year-old boy was arrested Saturday morning on suspicion of
burglary after he allegedly used a rock to shatter the window of a sport
utility vehicle and took a purse, authorities said.</LD>
<LD>   The suspect, a Fillmore youth whom officials declined to name because
of his age, also was being investigated in connection with several other
recent thefts in the area, authorities said.</LD>
<LD>   Shortly before 10 a.m., a witness called authorities after spotting
someone breaking into the vehicle in a city parking lot in the 300 block
of East Matilija Street.</LD>
<TE>   Deputies responded and arrested the teen a few minutes later as he ran
down a nearby street, according to Ventura County Sheriff's Capt. Mike
Colon. The purse was not recovered.</TE>

<HD>Supervisor to Seek End of Officials' Perk</HD>
<DH>Government: Steve Bennett assails the ability of six elected
managers to use vacation time to inflate their retirement pay. He calls
the pension benefit a giveaway.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CATHERINE SAILLANT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Calling it an excessive perk, a Ventura County supervisor says he
intends to end a lucrative pension benefit for six elected managers that
was approved even after two blue-ribbon commissions recommended it be
rejected.</LD>
<LD>   Steve Bennett said he will ask his colleagues on the Board of
Supervisors in coming weeks to end elected managers' ability to inflate
retirement pay by tacking the cash equivalent of seven weeks' vacation
time to their final-year salary.</LD>
<LD>   The perk is an inappropriate giveaway, Bennett said, because those
officials have no restrictions on how much time they take off.</LD>
<TE>   "Elected department heads can take any time off that they want and it
doesn't get subtracted from vacation time," he said. "And yet in their
final year, they get credit for seven weeks of vacation pay, which
increases their salary and therefore increases their retirement income."</TE>
<TE>   A Times analysis last year found the practice, known as
salary-spiking, boosted retirement pay an average of $6,000 a year.
Former Auditor-Controller Tom Mahon, for instance, received an extra
$13,400 a year in retirement pay when he stepped down in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   County officials estimate the perk will cost nearly $1 million over 10
years.</TE>
<TE>   Although board members cannot take the bonus away from incumbent
officeholders, they can eliminate it for future managers. Supervisors
rescinded the perk for themselves several years ago.</TE>
<TE>   Dist. Atty. Michael D. Bradbury, Clerk-Recorder Richard Dean and
Treasurer-Tax Collector Harold S. Pittman have all announced they will be
leaving at the end of the year. Their replacements will be elected this
year, making it a good time to do away with the perk, Bennett said. The
other two positions eligible for the perk are sheriff and assessor.</TE>
<TE>   Elected managers argue that appointed department heads are entitled to
the benefit and say it is a matter of equity to spread the perk across
the board. While elected managers can add the vacation bonus only to
their final-year salary, appointed managers are permitted to cash out the
value of their vacation time each year, Pittman said.</TE>
<TE>   "That inflates their salary every year," he said. "I just think that
fair is fair. Why should they get that much more?"</TE>
<TE>   A blue-ribbon salary review panel in 1992 recommended the board
eliminate several benefits for elected officials, including the vacation
allowance. As a result of the review panel's findings,, the value of
those benefits became a part of base pay.</TE>
<TE>   After elected department heads argued this created a disparity in
retirement income, a second blue-ribbon committee studied the issue in
June 1999. That committee agreed with the first, and no changes were
recommended.</TE>
<TE>   Two months later, however, the Board of Supervisors agreed to consider
giving the vacation benefit back to elected managers. Bennett questioned
the practice when the issue came before the board last year after Mahon's
retirement.</TE>
<TE>   Although he voted in favor of Mahon's bonus, Bennett said he wanted to
end the provision for future elected officials. It appears he may have
support from taxpayer advocates and board colleagues.</TE>
<TE>   Don Facciano, executive director of the Ventura County Taxpayers
Assn., said his group objects to any perks being used to spike pay.</TE>
<TE>   "Retirement should be based on salary and nothing more," he said. "We
don't think vacation pay should be folded into their retirement."</TE>
<TE>   At least two supervisors, John Flynn and Frank Schillo, agree the
provision needs to be reviewed. Schillo said he doesn't accept the
argument that elected managers should have benefits equivalent to
appointed department heads.</TE>
<TE>   "Since they are elected, they should have the same rules as the Board
of Supervisors," he said. "You can't have it both ways."</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>In his campaign literature, district attorney candidate Ron Bamieh
has falsely bragged, "I have never lost a felony trial." In a TV
advertisement shown repeatedly on CNN, MSNBC and FOX, ex-state Sen.
Cathie Wright is heard to say, "In over 60 cases, he has never lost a
felony trial." Mr. Bamieh changed the number of completed trials in his
written literature to "tried over 46 cases to verdict," which also
misrepresents his record.</LD>
<LD>   In that same TV commercial, Mr. Bamieh is quoted as saying, "We're in
the truth business; that is what we want from law enforcement." OK, Ron,
let's set forth some truths. Mr. Bamieh's trial record is available from
the district attorney's office through the Public Records Act (Calif.
Gov. Code  6251, et. seq.) Here is what the record shows:</LD>
<LD>   * Three misdemeanor court trials: three not-guilty verdicts. (In a
court trial, the judge decides the issue of guilt.)</LD>
<TE>   * Seventeen misdemeanor jury trials: five not-guilty verdicts, 11
guilty verdicts, one case dismissed by the judge at the request of the
defense.</TE>
<TE>   * Three felony court trials: three guilty verdicts.</TE>
<TE>   * Thirteen felony jury trials: 12 guilty verdicts, one hung jury, with
the case dismissed by the judge.</TE>
<TE>   * Five trials that were begun but not completed: one mistrial later
dismissed on motion of Mr. Bamieh's; two cases in which the defendant
pleaded guilty before conclusion of trial; two cases in which Mr. Bamieh
started the trial but they were not concluded to a verdict.</TE>
<TE>   Mr. Bamieh's TV ad clearly implies that he tried more than 60 felony
cases. Even if you include the five trials that were not completed, he
has tried only 19 felony cases, and only 41 cases total. In his campaign
literature he claims to have "tried over 46 trials to verdict." His
record from the district attorney's office, which he was given an
opportunity to correct before the office responded to the Public Records
Act request, shows only 34 trials in which a verdict was returned.</TE>
<TE>   As to his felony trial record, Mr. Bamieh tried Kenneth Williams for
false imprisonment, a felony, in 1995. The jury hung, and the court
dismissed the case. That's a loss; charges were filed against the
defendant, he was not convicted, and he went free. When you combine
felony and misdemeanor cases that went to verdict or were dismissed by
the judge, both court and jury trials, his record is 72% (26 out of 36).
This is not an impressive record for a prosecutor.</TE>
<TE>   It's time to set the record straight. Mr. Bamieh has been spending
tens of thousands of dollars on misleading advertising. Curiously, Mr.
Bamieh did not make these claims in his election ballot statement. That
must be because he knows he could be sued for making false statements in
a ballot statement. His campaign lies demonstrate that he is not in the
"truth business." Anyone willing to lie and distort his record to become
district attorney is unfit for that office.</TE>

<LD>The March 5 primary will decide not only who will occupy the two
open seats on the Ventura County Board of Supervisors, but also the
future of the region.</LD>
<LD>   With recent newspaper articles emphasizing the horse-race quality of
the campaigns--who the long shot is and how much money is being
wagered--the larger issue of how the board will function in 2003 and
beyond is being ignored.</LD>
<LD>   Tough decisions regarding growth and our quality of life will be made,
and we need representatives with courage and commitment.</LD>
<TE>   Linda Parks, a Thousand Oaks council member and candidate for the 2nd
District seat, has an eight-year record of public service.</TE>
<TE>   She has a master's degree in urban planning and is a 20-year member of
the American Planning Assn. She is a board member of the Local Agency
Formation Commission and the Air Pollution Control District.</TE>
<TE>   Linda Parks is the only candidate for the 2nd District with proven
leadership.</TE>
<TE>   Linda Parks served on the Thousand Oaks Planning Commission for four
years. In 1993, she co-founded the Discovery Center, a regional hands-on
science museum that will be located next to the Civic Arts Plaza. She
wrote the Parks Initiative in 1996, which protects open space from being
developed commercially without voter approval until 2026.</TE>
<TE>   As a director of SOAR (Save Open Space and Agricultural Resources),
she worked with Supervisor Steve Bennett and attorney Richard Francis to
pass the initiative that preserves the county's general plan, which is
the state-approved blueprint for development in the region. Rural, open
space and agricultural lands cannot be developed commercially without
voter approval until 2020, thanks in part to Linda Parks.</TE>
<TE>   Supervisors Bennett, John Flynn and Kathy Long endorsed Linda Parks
when she ran for City Council. Their seats are not being contested in
2002, so she would join them in January of next year.</TE>
<TE>   Linda Parks' vision for Ventura County, her dedication to preserving
our quality of life and her effectiveness have earned my respect. While
her opponent jockeys for name recognition, I know she is hard at work,
continuing to make government more responsive to the will of the people.</TE>

<HD>Crash Kills Pilot Near Airport</HD>
<DH>Aviation: Before hitting nose-first and exploding half a mile short
of the Fullerton runway, the Cessna narrowly missed homes and businesses.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>A twin-engine airplane crashed nose-first in an empty field while
trying to return to the Fullerton airport Saturday, killing the pilot and
narrowly missing several nearby homes.</LD>
<LD>   The Cessna Skymaster had taken off from Fullerton at 12:40 p.m. and
was making its way back only 20 minutes later when it appeared to lose
power and slammed into the field in Buena Park, half a mile from the
runway.</LD>
<LD>   "It was an awful sight. . . . I could hear the engine sputtering, and
sputtering really hard, and then he just starting turning and turning in
a downward motion. I thought he was doing tricks at first," said Alfredo
Ulloa, who was working at the airport at the time. It was the 29th crash
near or at the airport since 1985, and brought the death toll to 13.</LD>
<TE>   Coroner's investigators were still at the crash site late Saturday
evening, trying to retrieve the pilot's remains and to determine whether
he died alone. There were no deaths or injuries among those on the
ground, but officials were unsure until after 9 p.m. that no one else was
aboard.</TE>
<TE>   The pilot was not named, pending contact with relatives, and it was
not stated whether the pilot owned the plane.</TE>
<TE>   Although the pilot requested permission to land shortly after takeoff,
he did not report engine trouble, said Howard Plagens, a National
Transportation Safety Board investigator.</TE>
<TE>   Employees at the airport were watching the approaching plane and
noticed that its landing gear were still up. But before they could radio
this to the pilot, the plane rolled right and went into a nose dive,
Plagens said.</TE>
<TE>   The plummeting craft narrowly missed several businesses on
Commonwealth Avenue before crashing in the field near several homes. Some
witnesses wondered whether the pilot maneuvered to the spot to save
lives.</TE>
<TE>   "Some witnesses told us the pilot turned at the last minute and aimed
at the spot," said Steve Miller, a captain with the Orange County Fire
Authority.</TE>
<TE>   Fred Mercado, who owns a pet store near the crash site, said the plane
exploded in flames after hitting the ground, dashing all hopes of a
rescue.</TE>
<TE>   "There was a big boom that shook the whole building," Mercado said. "I
ran outside to see if I could help, but there was just this huge
fireball. I couldn't get near it. It was a huge explosion."</TE>
<TE>   Because the pilot did not submit a flight plan, it was unclear whether
he intended to travel to another airport or was just out for a
recreational flight, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of guys will just exercise their planes, take them up, fly a
pattern for fun," said Rod Propst, manager of the Fullerton airport. "If
you asked me to guess, that's what I'd say."</TE>
<TE>   Because the plane caught fire and was severely damaged in the crash,
investigators were at first unsure whether any passengers were on the
flight.</TE>
<TE>   The Federal Aviation Administration and NTSB are investigating.</TE>
<TE>   Residents near the Fullerton airport, on the city's west side, have
long complained that air traffic there poses serious risks.</TE>
<TE>   Before Saturday, the most recent crash was in April 2000, when a
Beechcraft Debonair hit a power line and plunged into an unoccupied home,
killing the pilot.</TE>
<TE>   In November 1995, a Piper Cherokee approaching the airport in thick
fog crashed into a townhouse complex, killing the pilot, a passenger and
a woman in her bed.</TE>
<TE>   "Somebody was very short-sighted in their planning, but what can you
do?" said Julia Fowler, who lives near the 2000 crash site and questions
the wisdom of having an airport amid so many homes.</TE>
<TE>   Miguel Selva, 50, who lives less than a mile from the airport on
Indiana Avenue, just a few hundred feet from the crash site, said he
watched in horror as the plane spun to the ground, then burst into
flames.</TE>
<TE>   He said too many planes fly in and out of the small airport.</TE>
<TE>   "And they fly too low. They fly so low they could take off the tops of
the trees. They're so close you could throw rocks at them."</TE>
<TE>   He said he often worries about planes crashing into his home.</TE>
<TE>   "It could happen at night when I'm in bed."</TE>
<TE>   Nino Cotela, 56, who lives on 7th Street, said the airport should
limit the number of flights.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't feel safe. They should put in more restrictions, and they
should make it harder for people to get their pilot's licenses. Why do so
many people have to fly?"</TE>
<TE>   But Gil Jones, 40, who also lives on Indiana near the crash site, said
he's not concerned about the number of plane accidents involving the
airport.</TE>
<TE>   "For as much as that airport is used, I don't think it's bad at all.
Just the noise, it can get loud. But it doesn't bother me a bit."</TE>

<HD>Measuring W's Planning Impact</HD>
<DH>Land use: 'It's back to square one' for El Toro reuse design if the
park initiative passes, an official says. That's assuming the county will
still want the property.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEAN O. PASCO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Even after spending seven years and $50 million, Orange County
isn't close to settling the question of what to do with the closed El
Toro Marine base. And a March ballot initiative asking voters to replace
airport planning with a large park and nature preserve may only muddy the
issue further.</LD>
<LD>   "If Measure W passes, we will have to start the reuse planning process
all over again," Gary Simon, director of the county's El Toro program
office, told county supervisors recently. "It's back to square one."</LD>
<LD>   That's assuming the county would still want the land.</LD>
<TE>   Supervisor Jim Silva, one of the board's pro-airport majority, has
warned that he's inclined to walk away from the base if the initiative
passes. Environmental contamination, he said, could be too expensive to
clean swiftly and completely to build anything other than an airport.</TE>
<TE>   "The county is going to have to make the decision whether to keep the
property or turn it back over to the Navy" after March 5, Silva said.</TE>
<TE>   The implications of the March 5 election have triggered a flurry of
meetings from Santa Ana to Washington as government officials grapple
with the prospect that seven years of airport planning could be
overturned. Neither side in the airport fight can say with certainty what
will happen if the measure passes.</TE>
<TE>Foes Say Reuse Plans Already Include a Park</TE>
<TE>   Airport foes, however, downplay the delays that would occur by
changing El Toro's blueprints. The current studies already include a park
at El Toro, they said, since the county has been planning to develop park
areas around three sides of the base, with the airport in the middle.</TE>
<TE>   "The Navy will quickly adjust if this initiative passes," said Paul
Eckles, executive director of the El Toro Reuse Planning Authority, a
coalition of South County cities opposed to an airport. "They can read
the polls too. So what do they do on March 6? They will try to find the
most direct path they can to unload the property with some legitimate
entity."</TE>
<TE>   It's expected that the base will be declared surplus this spring,
meaning that the Navy will have to dispose of it. The county has applied
to become the base's new owner, with the Federal Aviation Administration
as its sponsor. If the proposed use changes, a new sponsor would have to
be found, most likely the National Park Service.</TE>
<TE>   The Navy could turn over the base with restrictions, including, under
current plans, specifying certain acreage for aviation. If the land were
turned over for an airport and that ultimately wasn't built, the property
would revert to the Navy. Other provisions say that if the land is
transferred for one use but is used for another, the new owner accepts
all liability for the property.</TE>
<TE>   Once the Navy declares the property surplus, negotiations begin for
conveying the land. Under federal law, the Navy must pay for the cleanup,
though the base can be handed over before that happens. Cleanup plans are
based on how much money is authorized by Congress; there is no timetable
for completion.</TE>
<TE>   For seven years, the county and federal government have examined
environmental issues surrounding redevelopment of the base. Those
analyses are contained in three core documents required by law. So far,
the reviews have focused on an airport as the county's preferred use;
none have contemplated ripping up the runways for a park.</TE>
<TE>   "You clearly have to go back to the beginning," said Bruce Nestande, a
former state legislator and county supervisor who chairs Citizens for
Jobs and the Economy, which has promoted an airport at El Toro since
1994.</TE>
<TE>   The environmental analysis for a park is vastly different from that
required for an airport, Nestande said. For example, key areas of the
base haven't been identified for cleanup--including the runways--because
the intent is to continue using the land for an airport.</TE>
<TE>   "The Navy is not going to turn over the property on March 6 for a
park," Nestande said.</TE>
<TE>Irvine Has Plans for Ownership of Base</TE>
<TE>   Irvine already has declared its desire to assume responsibility for El
Toro. City officials, led by Mayor Larry Agran, drafted a development
plan for the park that includes a central lake, museum, sports fields, a
university campus and other development.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier this month, Irvine voted to begin yet another environmental
review needed before it can apply to annex the property to become part of
the city. The Navy so far has supported the county's control of the land.</TE>
<TE>   Other steps will need to be taken if the base's use should change. The
Board of Supervisors currently is the only entity in control of the
base's fate. Handing that authority to Irvine--or any other entity--would
require approval by the Navy, which also would have to approve the
annexation.</TE>
<TE>   In another twist, if Irvine should take control of the land, it would
not be bound by Measure W: The initiative ties the hands of only the
county on the base's redevelopment. Irvine officials, however, have
pledged to stick to the park plan.</TE>
<TE>   Eckles said two other possibilities exist if the initiative passes.
Airport foes are backing a challenger to board Chairwoman Cynthia P.
Coad, who faces reelection in March. If Fullerton Councilman Chris Norby
is successful, he would become a third vote on the board to pass El Toro
to Irvine.</TE>
<TE>   The other option, Eckles said, would be for the county to expand the
membership of the redevelopment panel to include South County city
officials.</TE>
<TE>   "The reality is that there will be powerful incentives to help us get
to a resolution of this thing," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Going from an airport to a park would require rewriting three key
documents: the base Community Reuse Plan, required by the federal
government and which the county completed in 1996; the Environmental
Impact Report, required by the state and certified by county supervisors
last month; and the Environmental Impact Statement, a joint review by the
Navy and the FAA that's scheduled to be approved this spring.</TE>
<TE>Florida Base's Airport Plan Became a Park</TE>
<TE>   Anti-airport forces acknowledge those hurdles but say there is a
precedent for switching uses midstream from an airport to a park:
Homestead Air Force Base in Florida.</TE>
<TE>   The local redevelopment authority there worked for seven years
planning commercial flights at the base, which sits between two national
parks, including the Everglades. The plan was vigorously opposed by
environmentalists but airport planning continued, including approval of
the federal environmental review.</TE>
<TE>   But President Clinton, as one of his final acts in office, grounded
the airport plan and instructed that areas of the base be turned over,
restricting their use as an airport.</TE>
<TE>   Bruce Drum, who headed the base aviation program, said Homestead was
unique for several reasons, including the unprecedented last-minute edict
from the White House. Homestead also remains an active Air Force Reserve
base.</TE>
<TE>   "It is unique, there's no question about it," said Drum, assistant
aviation director for operations at Miami International Airport, five
general-aviation airfields and Homestead.</TE>
<TE>   "Yet it's similar [to El Toro] because of the techniques being used to
fight it and the arguments about quality of life," he said. "That's the
same battle being fought anywhere you want to add a runway."</TE>

with its view of Boat Canyon and the Pacific Ocean and perched atop an
idyllic world of camellias, roses, asters and begonias.</LD>
<LD>   There just has to be.</LD>
<LD>   Miller isn't about to help me find it, though. We talk about her life
of 93 years and the mountainside garden she has maintained for 40
years--with its hundreds of species of flowers--but she won't wax poetic
or follow me down any philosophical trails.</LD>
<TE>   Nor will she linger on talk of her reputation as "The Green Woman of
Laguna Beach," a title bestowed because of her 2-acre garden that she has
bequeathed to the city when she dies.</TE>
<TE>   Surely, I say, there must be some eternal truths in this unique place.
She laughs and offers none, then says, "But I think if you want to read
eternal truths into things, this is a good place to do it."</TE>
<TE>   She's still sharp as a tack, eclectic, witty, smart and utterly
self-effacing about what she's leaving behind. Miller grew up in St.
Louis and early on developed a love of nature. As a girl, she'd walk
around St. Louis and draw pictures of flowers she would pick.</TE>
<TE>   In 1950, she and her husband, Oscar, left the Midwest for California.
In 1959, as her husband was dying of cancer, they moved to this hideaway.
"I always wanted to be the mother of a bougainvillea vine," she says.</TE>
<TE>   Her garden has been a longtime stop for local tour groups. In the
early 1970s, widowed and without heirs, she told the City Council it
could have her small house and huge garden when she died. "To have a
garden this big and this old is remarkable, I guess," she says.</TE>
<TE>   She is remarkable too, but seems unaware of it. "My parents died at
73," she says. "Both of them. I thought that's when you're supposed to
die, when your mother dies, and I was all ready for it at 73. And here I
am at 93, still mucking around."</TE>
<TE>Essays on Hawks, Insects and Avocados</TE>
<TE>   Hardly. The reason for my visit on this day is that a Dana Point
publisher has compiled 120 of Miller's essays, written originally between
1978 and 1998 for the Friends of the Garden newsletter. The resulting
book is titled "A Garden in Laguna." And despite Miller's
disclaimers--"Thirty-five dollars; that price is atrocious"--the book is
a gem of elegance and simplicity.</TE>
<TE>   In "Baby," a 1986 offering about a hawk that Miller took in, she
begins, "I first saw her hanging in the air above the road late on a
Sunday afternoon. . . . Have you ever had a hawk with serious business on
her mind fly at you? I have never known so instantly decisive a creature.
Ethelred the Unready was not one of her grandfathers."</TE>
<TE>   They're just little essays, Miller says, meant to give financial
backers of the garden's upkeep something to read.</TE>
<TE>   "I'd pick a plant and talk about it," she says. "I'd talk about the
blue moon. Or what Boat Canyon was doing or a plant I'd bought."</TE>
<TE>   She won't confess to putting heart and soul in her writings. "I never
stewed over them," she says. The book suggests otherwise.</TE>
<TE>   In a 1979 essay on her pet cockatoo, Dody, she writes: "I am ruffling
Dody's head and neck feathers, amazed at the intense yellow of the base
of each feather. . . . Cockatoos' necks are faintly perfumed. This gives
me yet another reason for burying my nose in that yellow radiance. Just
be sure before you try it that the cockatoo is friendly. You could lose a
nose."</TE>
<TE>   She writes about bobcats and ice plants, insects and avocados. Thumb
through the pages and you'll see references to Ring Lardner, Zeus, Hamlet
and King Arthur.</TE>
<TE>   It's a book of knowledge and insight. Whether she likes it or not,
Miller reveals herself page by page.</TE>
<TE>   I decide to quit pressing her on the point. Instead, we leave the
house and walk slowly through the garden that hugs the steep hillside,
through the plants and flowers that have helped define her life and will
be her eternal gift.</TE>
<TE>   Amid this living, breathing legacy, there's no need for metaphors.</TE>
<TE>   "Nice begonia," she says, pointing.</TE>
<TE>   Farther on . . . "These have the most marvelous flowers. They're
called angels' trumpets. Maybe you know them by that name."</TE>
<TE>   Later . . . "This is a Hawaiian hibiscus. Most hibiscus are Chinese,
you know."</TE>
<TE>   . . . "This is a Belle of Portugal. It's actually a Chinese rose.
Lovely, but mean. You see, when she's young, she has thorns. When she
gets older, she does away with them."</TE>

<LD>A fire at an Anaheim apartment complex forced 19 residents,
including seven children, out of their homes Friday night, but
authorities said all escaped without injury.</LD>
<LD>   The blaze erupted shortly after 10:40 p.m. in an upstairs apartment at
913 E. Balsam Ave. and spread to the next unit, destroying both, and
damaging a unit beneath them, said Maria Sabol, a spokeswoman for the
Anaheim Fire Department.</LD>
<LD>   The blaze took 40 minutes to contain and the cause is under
investigation, Sabol said. Damage is estimated at $175,000 to the
complex; $25,000 to the contents.</LD>

<HD>A Renewal of Our Resolve to Scale Down</HD>
<DH>Health: New year's first Weight Watchers classes pack 'em in as
usual. Shedding pounds tops Americans' list of annual resolutions.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEPHANIE CHAVEZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>At 6:30 a.m Saturday dozens of people with--shall we say
politely--pounds to spare began arriving for what would soon turn into
the busiest morning of the year at resolution central, a local Weight
Watchers meeting.</LD>
<LD>   "Almost every single person in my office said their New Year's
resolution was to lose weight," said Heather Winnin, 29. "I figured I
better get here early to get a chair."</LD>
<LD>   On this last day of the first week of the new year, the time had come
to make good on one of America's favorite promises. You know it, your
pants know it and the surgeon general has just issued a directive: LOSE
10 POUNDS, at least.</LD>
<TE>   Most of the resolute arrived in loose sweats and baggy shirts for one
of four packed, back-to-back meetings in Pasadena. All seemed focused on
their 2002 dreams.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't want to be a fat mom anymore," said Deena Maltox, 28, of
Monrovia.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm going to lose 15 pounds by April," pledged Pamela Muzyka, 30, of
Pasadena, "and then buy my wedding dress."</TE>
<TE>   They promised that sometime in 2002 they will climb up a flight of
stairs without getting winded and walk without their inner thighs
rubbing. They envisioned a year that will bring a return to pleated
pants, the freedom to cross their legs while in a sitting position and
the stamina to run alongside their children.</TE>
<TE>   Meeting leader Sheila Montoya--"I lost 148 pounds and have kept it off
for five years"--had braced herself for the crowds, sipping water while
shouting her message of weight-loss determination. By the end of the
sessions, 401 people had weighed in--about 100 more than on a normal
Saturday--and 60 first-time members had signed on.</TE>
<TE>   "Y'all ready? New beginning, new year? How many of you made weight
loss your resolution?" Hands shoot skyward.</TE>
<TE>   John C. Norcross, a professor of psychology at the University of
Scanton in Pennsylvania, studies trends in American New Year's
resolutions. For 20 years, he said, weight loss has led the list.</TE>
<TE>   "It's become a tradition," Norcross said, explaining that a widespread
obsession with body image, combined with increasing ranks of obese
Americans, fuels the desire. Only last month, the U.S. surgeon general
reported that 62% of Americans are at least overweight, if not downright
obese, compared with 48% in 1980.</TE>
<TE>   By June, Norcross said, only about 40% of those who make resolutions
will still be sticking to them. "All the studies are a little bit
different, but they all say that most people will fail."</TE>
<TE>   That's just the kind of bummer fact that the new diet inductees
refused to let ruin their morning. People like Karen O'Connor want to
forget the iced-cookie scene of last week and focus anew.</TE>
<TE>   "There I was the day after New Year's, trying to make a good start,
throwing away all the cookies," she said. "And as I'm doing it, I'm
putting them in my mouth."</TE>
<TE>   Montoya and other Weight Watchers leaders said the first Saturday in
January is always like a big reunion. "People I have not seen in years
show up this week," Montoya said.</TE>
<TE>   Raffaella Yates, the leader of a popular Laguna Niguel meeting,
managed similar standing-room-only crowds there Saturday. She told her
members not to make weight loss resolutions because "they're a set of
expectations that are going to fail."</TE>
<TE>   Norcross, the resolution expert, agrees. He counsels his patients to
turn resolutions to lose weight into goals for a healthier diet. Then,
even eating a carrot can be a measure of success.</TE>
<TE>   The five-vegetable-a-day issue provoked grumbles from some Pasadena
members.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm getting kind of sick of salads," said one woman.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not my natural tendency to have so many vegetables around me,"
added another.</TE>
<TE>   Here's where group support kicked in--change the subject to something
positive, like a new pot pie recipe.</TE>
<TE>   "It's really thick, has a lot of vegetables inside and what looks like
a biscuit on top," said Eileen Baumgartner, 53, who boasted of freezing
four pies.</TE>
<TE>   Veteran member Marla Provencio attracted much attention with her
story. There she sat, petite in her fitted black jeans and ribbed
turtleneck. She has lost 67 pounds, but recently struggled with the
temptation of a Krispy Kreme doughnut.</TE>
<TE>   "They brought 'em in the office again. I knew I had to face this. So I
took half a doughnut and felt like I was part of society again," she
said. "I counted it in the program. It felt so good."</TE>
<TE>   Another veteran, an undersea diving enthusiast, told how she finally
fit into an XL-size wetsuit for the first time. "I didn't have to have it
custom-made."</TE>
<TE>   Weight Watchers, along with other weight loss programs and fitness
clubs, cashes in on January resolutions with high-profile ad campaigns
and cut-rate memberships.</TE>
<TE>   Nearly everyone returning to the Pasadena meeting after their
self-imposed holiday hiatus clutched a discount coupon.</TE>
<TE>   "I got this flier and it was like a sign," said one woman. "I knew it
was time."</TE>
<TE>   The modern self-improvement-based resolution is rooted in ancient
Roman times when workers would offer resolutions for good conduct to the
god Janus, said Norcross.</TE>
<TE>   The two-faced Janus was the patron of beginnings and endings; hence
the month January.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, for 38-year-old Stacy Sanchez, December marked the end of
pastrami sandwiches, burritos and burgers.</TE>
<TE>   "Christmas was ham, not activities," she said.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm stuffed, I'm tired of eating," she said while filling out her new
membership form. "I've actually been looking forward to this."</TE>

<HD>Bush's Primary Focus Nonpartisan in Southland Stop</HD>
<DH>Politics: The Inland Empire exults in the spotlight, but Gov.
Davis' three GOP rivals find it more elusive.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SCOTT GOLD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Inland Empire's self-image, long tarnished by lack of a
clear-cut identity, got a boost Saturday when President Bush swept into
Ontario for a "town hall" meeting. Just as intriguing to California
politicos, however, was the posturing of three men striving to topple
Gov. Gray Davis.</LD>
<LD>   Each of the three Republicans was quietly vying for the president's
attention and blessing. Each knew full well he wouldn't get it, not on
this day, anyway. And each knew he was expected to play nice--no small
task, it has seemed lately, for California Secretary of State Bill Jones,
former Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan and financier Bill Simon Jr.,
the trio that will duke it out in the March 5 Republican gubernatorial
primary.</LD>
<LD>   Just in case, "I've got a couple of baskets of rotten tomatoes to
throw if I need them," Riordan said with a laugh.</LD>
<TE>   In the end, Davis wound up reaffirming the power of incumbency by
scoring the only face time with the president--a 15-minute conversation
in Bush's motorcade en route to Ontario International Airport.</TE>
<TE>   "Today wasn't their day. Today was Bush's day," said Roy Hernandez, a
Loma Linda store manager and a member of the San Bernardino County
Republican Central Committee. "As the primary comes up, they will have
their day. The fireworks will come. Right now the focus is on the
president coming to our area."</TE>
<TE>   That was an event in itself.</TE>
<TE>   It seems incongruous to hear business and community leaders from the
Inland Empire, a ballooning region of more than 3 million people, say
they need to be "put on the map." But that message echoed through the
Ontario Convention Center on Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   The Inland Empire has always felt like the stepchild of Los
Angeles--the recipient of its smog and traffic and trash, the supplier of
much of its labor force, but somehow still not a player in the
metropolis.</TE>
<TE>   That was just one factor that brought Bush a boisterous reception
Saturday, though the president was venturing into a state he lost by 1.3
million votes and focusing his attention on California
Latinos--three-fourths of whom voted for Al Gore in November 2000.</TE>
<TE>   "He could have been in Los Angeles. He could have been anywhere. He
chose Ontario," said Joe McTarsney, 31, an area youth minister. "Because
of this, our community has recognition."</TE>
<TE>   The crowd of more than 5,000 was abuzz well before the president
arrived--breaking out into robust applause, for instance, when two Secret
Service agents took the stage, one to hang the presidential seal from the
podium, the second to bring out Bush's cup of water. Several members of
the partisan crowd, dressed in sequined red, white and blue outfits,
seemed to have raided Evel Knievel's closet on their way to Ontario.</TE>
<TE>   Bush sounded the patriotic and bellicose tones his supporters were
looking for, using the word "evil" eight times in 20 minutes to describe
followers of Osama bin Laden and to reiterate his determination to end
global terrorism. And he catered to the Latinos the GOP is hoping to win
over in California, speaking in halting Spanish on several occasions and
saying that Mexico's economic viability is of enormous importance to the
United States.</TE>
<TE>   "Traditionally Latinos are more Democratic," said Fred Carranza, 64, a
retired businessman from Santa Monica. "But that doesn't mean that Mr.
Bush is not going to deliver. And today he has demonstrated that he is
very interested in doing that."</TE>
<TE>   Bush could also help deliver victory to one of the GOP candidates for
governor, supporters believe. That served as the political subtext to the
morning event.</TE>
<TE>   Riordan, considered by GOP critics a Democrat in Republican clothing,
only joined the race after not-so-subtle urging from the White House. The
White House lobbying came after Jones yanked his endorsement of Bush and
sided with Arizona Sen. John McCain before the 2000 GOP primary.</TE>
<TE>   "The president can play a tremendous role in winning this election,"
Jones said. "His support is going to be critical."</TE>
<TE>   But Bush isn't expected to threaten his high approval ratings, or his
bipartisan support, by wading into a California Republican primary.</TE>
<TE>   "He can't," Riordan said. "He cannot pick any candidate."</TE>
<TE>   Said Simon: "The best way to earn the president's support is to win
the primary."</TE>
<TE>   That's only half the battle, of course. The winner of the Republican
primary will face Davis in the general election.</TE>
<TE>   And though the GOP candidates have berated Davis in recent weeks,
accusing him of everything from mishandling the state lottery to plunging
California into fiscal crisis, the Democratic governor showed Saturday
why it's always tough to challenge an incumbent.</TE>
<TE>   He was the last person to enter the Convention Center before Bush, and
his arrival caused quite a stir (plus a few boos from the conservative
crowd). He was the first to leave with Bush, and he then returned to the
center for a crowded news conference.</TE>
<TE>   Davis said he talked about several issues with Bush during the
president's ride to the airport, including his proposal to allow Highway
Patrol troopers to assist with security on commercial flights that
originate and end in California. The troopers would not replace the air
marshals that are on some flights now, but would provide supplemental
security, Davis aides said.</TE>
<TE>   The governor also suggested to the president that other large states,
such as Texas, Florida and New York, use their troopers for similar
security measures. Troopers routinely ride planes anyway as part of their
regular duties, Davis said, adding that the president seemed receptive to
the idea.</TE>
<TE>   Davis also said his security advisor, George Vinson, will go to the
White House later this month to help fine-tune a multiple-stage alert
system that would rank threats to public safety based on the credibility
of the information.</TE>
<TE>   Davis warned of a "credible" terrorist threat against large California
bridges in November.</TE>
<TE>   After federal officials said the threats should not have been
announced, the governor began preparing a four-stage alert system for
California.</TE>
<TE>   At the request of Thomas J. Ridge, director of the White House Office
of Homeland Security, Davis postponed those plans--apparently because
Ridge is planning to unveil a similar system nationwide. Vinson will
assist in putting Ridge's plan together, Davis said. Finally, the
governor said he will not propose any new taxes when he unveils the state
budget this month.</TE>
<TE>   The state is expected to suffer through a two-year, $12-billion budget
gap, the worst since the recession 10 years ago. Davis said he also asked
Bush if the federal government would consider defraying some of the
state's costs of providing additional security since Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   "He gave me the impression he was interested in sharing some of those
costs," Davis said. "How and when that sharing occurs is up to him."</TE>

<HD>Budget Deficit Shadows Capitol</HD>
<DH>Spending: Deciding how to deal with a looming $12-billion shortfall
is the most serious issue facing state lawmakers returning for the start
of the 2002 session.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<DL>SACRAMENTO
</DL>
<LD>California lawmakers just lived through a bizarre and stressful
year of man-made energy shortages, blackouts and billion-dollar utility
bankruptcies.</LD>
<LD>   Now comes budget mayhem. In an election year, no less.</LD>
<LD>   As legislators take down their Christmas trees and flock back to the
Capitol for the start of the 2002 lawmaking session Monday, they are
being greeted by a sobering reality: The energy crisis might be over, but
the financial mess it helped create certainly is not.</LD>
<TE>   "No one is too excited about it, but we all know we have a
responsibility," said Assemblyman Herb Wesson (D-Culver City) of the
budget mess.</TE>
<TE>   "Obviously, it's the most serious issue affecting the state," said the
lawmaker, who is set to take over as speaker of the lower house next
month.</TE>
<TE>   California faces a $12-billion budget deficit because of a slumping
economy and a resulting downturn in revenue from taxes on stock options
and capital gains, which the state had come to rely on during the dot-com
boom. And that deficit figure doesn't even include the $6 billion the
state spent on electricity last year.</TE>
<TE>   If California cannot complete a long-delayed bond sale to replenish
state coffers for the power purchases, lawmakers will have to contend
with a much more daunting $18-billion fiscal hole when they prepare the
next budget.</TE>
<TE>   "This year is going to be defined by the budget. There's no question
about it," said Assemblyman Keith Richman (R-Northridge). "We are looking
at a $12-billion budget deficit, and I am concerned that may worsen."</TE>
<TE>   Added Assemblyman Joe Simitian (D-Palo Alto): "It's going to be grim.
It's going to make the energy crisis look like a warmup. . . . You cannot
finesse a budget problem of that magnitude."</TE>
<TE>   State Senate President pro tem John L. Burton (D-San Francisco)
described devising a solution to the state's unpalatable fiscal condition
as the "nutcracker" issue of the legislative session.</TE>
<TE>   At least Burton, who has spent more than 30 years in public office,
and has chewed on state budgets since the 1960s, when Pat Brown was
governor, has some context in which to view the issue. For a largely
unseasoned group of lawmakers who mostly came to the state capital in the
last five years, after term limits forced out the Sacramento lifers,
deficit politics will be a new experience.</TE>
<TE>   "I am expecting another baptism by fire," said Assemblywoman Rebecca
Cohn (D-Saratoga), one of many newcomers who barely had time to hunt for
apartments before they had to jump right into their legislative careers
at the start of the energy crisis.</TE>
<TE>   The state has not had a budget problem this grave since 1991, when
Republican Gov. Pete Wilson was faced with a decline in the
California-centered aerospace industry at the same time the national
economy was in recession. Most of the current crop of legislators has
been weaned on the multibillion-dollar budget surpluses of the late
1990s.</TE>
<TE>   xWith little money to go around, some lawmakers worry that it will be
hard to fashion any legislation of consequence this political season.</TE>
<TE>   But Assemblywoman Carole Migden (D-San Francisco), who in recent years
carried successful legislation curtailing predatory lending practices and
allowing gay and lesbian couples to register as domestic partners in the
state, said the shortage of cash should not deter lawmakers from trying
to make a major impact.</TE>
<TE>   In the fat years, Migden said, "Everyone was greedy beyond belief."
Now, she said, lawmakers will have to be more creative and "do something
brilliant that does not cost a lot of money."</TE>
<TE>   Wesson agreed, and joked that his fellow lawmakers will surely come up
with clever attempts to make new laws.</TE>
<TE>   Already, lawmakers are gearing up to push a variety of far-reaching
bills at the beginning of the session.</TE>
<TE>   For the third year running, Sen. Don Perata (D-Alameda) will attempt
to pass a measure clamping down on the payday loan industry, which
consumer groups accuse of charging usurious interest rates to the poor.
The industry has derailed previous efforts.</TE>
<TE>   For the second straight year, Assemblyman Paul Koretz (D-West
Hollywood) will try to pass legislation allowing gay and lesbian couples
to enter into "civil unions," which are not technically the same as
marriage but grant a couple many of the same rights.</TE>
<TE>   And numerous lawmakers are seeking to pass measures to protect
financial privacy at a time in which banks, government agencies and other
lending institutions are increasingly sharing and selling sensitive
personal information without an individual's knowledge.</TE>
<TE>   Inevitably, however, dealing with the deficit will become the primary
showcase for Democrats and Republicans to score political points and
highlight philosophical divides heading into the March primary and
November general election. The three GOP challengers to Gov. Gray Davis
are already in full attack mode, hammering the Democratic incumbent at
every turn over his fiscal management.</TE>
<TE>Parties' Differences on Budget Becoming Clear</TE>
<TE>   With the fortunes of many so-called down-ballot races contingent on
the outcome of the governor's race, legislators are bound to get caught
up in the partisan ruckus. All 80 Assembly seats will be up for grabs
during the election, as well as half of the Senate's 40 seats, giving
most incumbents a personal stake in the fight.</TE>
<TE>   The parties' differences are, in fact, already becoming clear in the
way legislative leaders say they plan to tackle the budget problem.</TE>
<TE>   Like Republicans, Democrats, who control both houses of the
Legislature, are pledging to focus on shielding popular programs such as
education and public safety from the brunt of the budget cuts.</TE>
<TE>   But many Democrats are also intent on preserving welfare and health
care spending and other social programs they consider vital to protecting
against the harsher consequences of an economic downturn. And some other
Democrats are touting massive bond issues to boost government investment
in the state's aging infrastructure, such as schools and roads.</TE>
<TE>   Burton, the most powerful figure in the Legislature, identified bond
issues for construction of schools and affordable homes as two of his top
priorities.</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Steve Peace (D-El Cajon), chairman of the Senate Budget
Committee, said he supports piling numerous public works projects into an
unprecedented bond issue of as much as $100 billion, to be paid off over
30 years. Included would be money for water, housing and higher
education.</TE>
<TE>   "I could make a pretty good argument that we should borrow everything
we can get our hands on, because the interest rates are so attractive,"
he said.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, some Democrats are raising the controversial
possibility of a tax increase to help offset the deficit. Migden and Sen.
Dede Alpert (D-Coronado) have already announced that they will seek to
undo a recent cut in the fee Californians pay to register their cars.
Burton says he supports the idea. Wesson said it should be considered.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Republicans vow to fight that plan with everything they've
got. GOP lawmakers appear energized by the deficit, in part because the
budget is one of the few major issues on which the minority party still
wields political clout. The budget, along with any new taxes, must be
approved by a two-thirds vote, and that requires Republican support.</TE>
<TE>   "We are going to oppose raising taxes of any kind," said Senate GOP
floor leader Jim Brulte (R-Rancho Cucamonga).</TE>
<TE>Other Issues Still Command Attention</TE>
<TE>   Rather than focusing on how to raise more money, Republicans are
repeating one of their favorite themes: reducing the size of government.
They contend that Davis and Democratic legislators have essentially spent
more than they had in recent years, and GOP lawmakers are gleefully
hoisting the budget ax.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't have a revenue problem; we have a restraint problem," Brulte
said. "When you grow government 37% in three years, when the population
has grown only 5% and the consumer price index has grown only 7%, that
just shows a lack of restraint."</TE>
<TE>   Numerous other issues figure to command attention from lawmakers this
year, notably the embers of the energy crisis. Though power prices have
plummeted and the state is on its way out of the financial morass, many
lawmakers believe that the state still lacks a long-term plan to make its
energy market work.</TE>
<TE>   There is also the new issue of terrorism, and the many demands facing
government from the city to the state level since Sept. 11. Republicans
quickly entered the fray this winter with a series of proposals to help
law enforcement deal with terrorists, including letting prosecutors
charge terrorists with the death penalty in the unlikely event that a
terrorist faced trial in state rather than federal court.</TE>
<TE>   But Burton is already pouring cold water on the minority party's
proposals, which would need Democrats' support to get out of any
committee, let alone both houses.</TE>
<TE>   "The feds have already fairly occupied that field," he said. "The
people who want these bills want to get their names in the newspapers.
The best thing the state can do is have effective medical and emergency
responses."</TE>

<HD>Pep Team Tryouts Get Jeered</HD>
<DH>Dispute: Students and parents yell foul over selection of the
cheerleading squad at Newport Harbor High.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JESSICA GARRISON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Pompoms have been exchanged for petitions. Pep practices have given
way to protests. There are tears, not cheers as Newport Harbor High
School's cheerleaders battle it out in a Texas-sized fracas over yelling
rights on the coastal campus.</LD>
<LD>   At issue: Who among the 48 girls trying out for 30 slots actually
deserves to be on the team? Or, as one school official suggested, should
they all get a spot?</LD>
<LD>   "This has gotten pretty nasty," said Mike Johnston, a father of two
cheerleaders who scored well in the tryouts and made the original team.
"It's tough to say, but when you have athletic contests or beauty
contests, there are winners and losers. You don't just give everybody a
crown. This isn't junior soccer."</LD>
<TE>   Ever since 1996, when the school district settled a lawsuit and paid a
former cheerleader tens of thousands of dollars in damages after she
didn't make the team, Newport Harbor High has gone to unheard of lengths
to ensure the fairness of the selection process. Auditions, conducted by
a panel of five professional judges, are overseen by a certified public
accountant and a representative from the League of Women Voters.</TE>
<TE>   This time, even those safeguards didn't work.</TE>
<TE>   It started with tryouts on Nov. 29. Many girls had spent months
preparing for the competition, even paying thousands of dollars for
specialized dance and cheerleader coaching.</TE>
<TE>   Some parents and the team's faculty advisor say the selection process
was executed beautifully. But other parents and the cheerleading coach
say tryout judges didn't use the right selection criteria.</TE>
<TE>   As a result, the critics say, girls who flubbed the mandatory routine
but improvised with smiles and panache were chosen over girls who made it
through dizzying chains of pirouettes and twirls as required.</TE>
<TE>   "I've never seen such inconsistencies," said Lisa Callahan, a former
professional cheerleader who has coached Newport Harbor High's squad for
the last 13 years. She said this is the first time she has questioned a
tryout.</TE>
<TE>   "My advisor thinks I'm doing this because I wanted certain girls on
the team," said Callahan, who is paid by the high school booster club and
supervised by a faculty advisor. "But I just didn't think it was fair
what happened."</TE>
<TE>   Callahan--who attended the tryouts but does not have a vote--said she
went to school officials to protest when she learned who was chosen.</TE>
<TE>   When they heard about the alleged inconsistencies, a group of mothers
of girls who had not made the team also rallied to the cause.</TE>
<TE>   School officials tried to mediate the dispute, but to no avail. That
their attempts to resolve matters haven't helped seems to be the only
thing parents on both sides can agree on. The principal has promised to
make a final decision on the matter this week.</TE>
<TE>   Faculty advisor Jennifer Cilderman insists that the tryout process was
fair and believes the team should go forward with the judges' choices.</TE>
<TE>   "I want the integrity of the cheer program to be upheld," said
Cilderman, adding that improvising when you can't do a certain step or
movement is "just part of performing."</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the ongoing furor is the talk of this upscale beach town,
even during winter break. Girls who have studied dance together for years
have stopped speaking. And as basketball season dawns, skirts and
sweaters have yet to be ordered. The practice floor is empty. And no one
can agree who rightfully can call herself a cheerleader.</TE>
<TE>   When the controversy first erupted, Principal Michael Vossen responded
by deciding that all who tried out could be on the squad. On Dec. 12,
Vossen sent a letter to all cheerleaders and their parents in which he
promised to address any inconsistencies in the tryout process in future
years. He concluded: "I implore all of you to work cooperatively with us
to ensure that these fine young ladies have a successful season."</TE>
<TE>   At first, that decision seemed OK with everyone. The girls who had not
made the first cut were ecstatic.</TE>
<TE>   "When I got the phone call, I started crying because I was so happy,"
said junior Katie Stephens. Being a cheerleader, the 16-year-old added,
"is something I have always wanted to do."</TE>
<TE>   All the girls practiced together for a week, flipping each other into
the air as needed, and belting cheers, according to coach Callahan.</TE>
<TE>   Then a group of parents whose daughters made the original cut lodged
their own complaint with district officials. They noted that all parents
and prospective pep squad members had vowed in writing to abide by the
panel judges' decisions.</TE>
<TE>   "The rules are the rules," said Johnston, who said his daughters
support his actions but because the issue has become so explosive, he
doesn't want them to discuss it publicly. "I think it's a horrible
message to give to kids that if you don't make the cut and if you scream
loud enough, they'll give you what you want."</TE>
<TE>   At the request of those parents, the district convened a special
committee of top district brass. School officials suspended pep practices
pending an investigation.</TE>
<TE>   The committee decided that judging during the tryouts had been fair.
It recommended that the original squad be restored, but that two more
positions would be added to both the varsity and junior varsity teams.
Additional tryouts would be held to determine who got the new spots.</TE>
<TE>   Now, some of the girls who won the nod of the original judges disagree
with that solution.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think it's fair," said Ashlee Krol, a sophomore who made the
varsity squad. She and some of the other cheerleaders who made the team
are circulating a petition asking the principal to keep all the girls on
the team.</TE>
<TE>   "All of a sudden, they made this decision to put the girls on and they
were all excited. And then a week later, they tell them they're off,"
said Krol, 15. "It's like they're playing with their heads."</TE>
<TE>   Krol said she and her friends have been stunned to watch parents and
coaches fighting with administrators. Equally surprising, however, is
that some cheerleaders, who are traditionally stalwart supporters of the
status quo and guardians of school spirit, are openly defying the adults.</TE>
<TE>   "It's just weird how this is happening," she said. "We're fighting
with the administration, and we just don't do that."</TE>
<TE>   Just before the two-week holiday break, Vossen, the principal, held a
meeting with the affected girls and their parents to tell them of the
committee's findings.</TE>
<TE>   "The parents just went ballistic," said Katie's mother, Kim Stephens,
herself a former baton twirler at Newport Harbor High School and past
president of the cheer boosters. "They were not willing to accept the . .
. answer. And they were not going to leave that place until there was a
solution."</TE>
<TE>   The meeting went on for nearly three hours, participants said. Girls
were crying. Accusations against administrators were flying. Finally,
some of the girls implored the principal to consider their views, and
perhaps put the matter to a vote of all the cheerleaders, some who
attended said.</TE>
<TE>   On Dec. 28, Vossen, who could not be reached for comment, responded in
a written letter to all the girls who had tried out.</TE>
<TE>   He told them to stop circulating their petitions. Instead, he told
them, he would hold individual, confidential meetings with cheerleaders
before making a final decision on Tuesday. Practice, he told them, will
begin on Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   Jamie Castellanos, the district's assistant superintendent of
secondary education, said he hopes the matter can be resolved soon.</TE>
<TE>   "This has gotten way out of hand," he said. "I think the kids are
working through it better than the parents. . . . It's just grown out of
control."</TE>

<DL>ANGELS CAMP
</DL>
<LD>In early September, several wildfires burned across the California
Gold Country. One of them, called the Darby Fire, roared up a river
canyon and destroyed a 19th century wooden flume. Known to locals as the
"three-quarter-mile flume," this antique artery still carried water from
a reservoir over the hills to thousands of residents of Angels Camp and
neighboring towns in Calaveras County.</LD>
<LD>   "Everybody always asked what would happen if we lost the
three-quarter-mile flume," an old-timer told the San Francisco Chronicle.
"By God, we are gonna find out."</LD>
<LD>   That was on Sept. 10. The next morning, I was in my car at dawn, bound
for Angels Camp. As I headed out, I turned the radio to an all-news
station, hoping for an overnight update on the fires. Instead, I caught
the tail end of a report out of New York, something about a plane hitting
the World Trade Center.</LD>
<TE>   Within minutes, the San Francisco station had given way to its New
York affiliate. For the next 90 minutes, I followed the events, one
unimaginable development after another. It was, to understate, a strange
listening experience. The panting dispatches from field reporters, the
calm but slightly incredulous interjections by the news anchors, the
background noises of rumbling buildings, of thousands of shuffling feet
and nonstop sirens--all of these combined to give the broadcast an almost
over-the-top feel, something akin to Orson Welles' "War of the Worlds"
program.</TE>
<TE>   I never did make it to Angels Camp that morning. I drove over Altamont
Pass and across the floor of the San Joaquin Valley, stopping at a coffee
shop in Oakdale. In an adjoining bar, two televisions had drawn a small
crowd--a few men in business suits, a San Francisco woman headed for
Yosemite, a couple of busboys.</TE>
<TE>   As we watched the buildings come down, again and again, the men
screamed profanities at the television screen. The woman decided not to
go to Yosemite after all; she began to map out a route that would take
her back to San Francisco without having to cross any bridges. I turned
on my cell phone and waited for the call from Los Angeles summoning me to
help cover the story.</TE>
<TE>   The perils of Sierra wildfires no longer seemed quite so pressing.
Indeed, given the chaotic new world that had boiled out of my radio that
morning, the very idea of musing in print about California now struck me
as off-key, a luxury to be suspended for the duration, a plaything to be
put away for a better time.</TE>
<TE>   I drove to Los Angeles that afternoon and, for the rest of the year,
worked on projects related to the terrorist attacks. From time to time, I
wondered how Angels Camp had made out. I assumed that the town had not
withered up and died, but if there had been any follow-up reports, I
missed them.</TE>
<TE>   And so, in the spirit of closing a circle, I found myself last
Wednesday aimed, once more, toward the Gold Country. It rained hard the
whole way, and on the radio were reports of 13 more bodies being pulled,
all these months later, from what had been a World Trade Center lobby.</TE>
<TE>   Vern Pyle, general manager of the Utica Power Authority here, was
surprised to see a journalist at his door. On Sept. 11, he said, there
supposedly had been a flood of television crews and newspaper types
rushing toward soon-to-be-dry Angels Camp. None of them ever made it.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a strange time," he said. "It was, like, here we have got our
own big problem, and now the whole country has a problem."</TE>
<TE>   For Pyle and the small crew that tend the waterworks here, there had
been no time to become transfixed with the television imagery of Sept.
11. They worked 15 hours a day, 20 straight days, beginning before the
fire was even out. They rebuilt as much of the flume system as possible.
Where damage was too severe or the terrain too steep for quick repairs,
they rerouted the water through a temporary system of pipes and pumps.</TE>
<TE>   The work was done in a climate of community angst and acrimony. Public
meetings overflowed with residents worried about losing gardens and
crops. Some of the newcomers, part of a broader population shift that has
seen masses of urban Californians move into the foothills, expressed
outrage over the fact that their water came to them via uncovered wooden
channels, circa 1880.</TE>
<TE>   "I had one guy tell me," Pyle recalled, "that if he knew his water was
coming from a ditch, he wouldn't have moved here. I said, 'Well, that's
California. That's how a lot of water gets moved in this state. I mean,
go look at the California Aqueduct.' "</TE>
<TE>   The crisis passed. Later this year, permanent repairs to the flume
system will be completed. Angels Camp still will receive its water via "a
ditch," but one with metal footings and other concessions to 21st century
engineering.</TE>
<TE>   There have been other adjustments as well, ones that have nothing to
do with the fire.</TE>
<TE>   "We've got ID cards now," Pyle said. "We've got locked gates."</TE>
<TE>   And the flume is inspected more frequently, and not just for leaks and
cracks, but for tampering by terrorists. "We've changed a lot of things,"
Pyle said, "since Sept. 11."</TE>

<HD>Helping Kids in Need Bear Their Burdens</HD>
<DH>* Children touched by the Sept. 11 attacks are only the latest to
benefit from teddy 'bearapy,' thanks to private donors.</DH>

<AU>CARA MIA DiMASSA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Almost 100 years after Theodore Roosevelt's refusal to shoot a bear
cub on a hunting trip inspired a toy maker to name a stuffed bear after
him, the teddy bear has become a symbol of the healing power of the
American spirit.</LD>
<LD>   Call it bearapy: donating teddy bears to children in need, in the hope
that a furry friend will offer some sense of relief, or even solace.</LD>
<LD>   Because of the work of a string of nonprofit institutions, teddy bears
arrive daily at America's cancer wards, homeless shelters and the homes
of families confronting various misfortunes.</LD>
<TE>   Lately, they've been arriving at the homes of families touched by the
Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. Teddy bears have been gathered by
schoolchildren wanting to make a difference, businesses hoping to go
beyond writing a check, and churches and synagogues looking to do more
than bake cookies.</TE>
<TE>   "There's something magical about a teddy bear," said Bobbie Moran, who
runs Operation Teddy Care with her husband, Bob Baker, a retired trauma
psychologist, and their 12-year-old son, C.J., out of their Moss Beach
home in Northern California. "They are kind of mythical characters. They
don't have any cultural identity, don't carry any baggage with them.
There's something about that face that says, 'I understand; I am
listening. If you need a hug, let me give you one.' "</TE>
<TE>   Operation Teddy Care began in 1995, when C.J. asked what his family
could do for the victims of the Kobe earthquake in Japan. Moran
remembered the three teddy bears that she had placed in the family's
earthquake kit when C.J. was younger and suggested sending teddy bears.</TE>
<TE>   The threesome collected bears from friends, neighbors and
organizations--just about anyone--until they had amassed 10,000 bears.
All went to Japan.</TE>
<TE>   Now, collecting bears for children in "natural and man-made disasters"
and distributing them via crisis counselors constitute almost a full-time
job for Moran.</TE>
<TE>   Barbara Maurer, who runs the Trauma in Youth Program in Bergen County,
N.J., uses Operation Teddy Care bears in counseling children who lost
parents in the Sept. 11 attacks.</TE>
<TE>   The gift of a teddy bear, she said, shows them that someone cares.
Some children, she said, use the bears as a "transitional object,"
something they can talk to until they're ready to share their feelings
with another person.</TE>
<TE>   "I've watched children sitting in hospital waiting rooms," said Irene
Matin-Nia, director of the Teddy Bear Care Foundation, "and cry right
into their stuffed animals."</TE>
<TE>   There are more than a dozen teddy bear distribution agencies in the
nation, many of them family-run, each with a slightly different focus.
TeddyCare in Perris, Calif., places the stuffed animals with service
providers, such as police officers, firefighters, trauma centers,
ambulances and child welfare offices.</TE>
<TE>   The Teddy Bear Care Foundation in Pleasanton, Calif., focuses on
children in pediatric wards. The Teddy Bear Foundation in Ipswich, Mass.,
donates bears to family shelters and hospitals. Good Bears of the World
in Toledo, Ohio, makes teddy bears available to police officers, to keep
in the trunks of their squad cars until they are needed. Teddy Bears That
Care, in New York, gives its bears to children affected by domestic
abuse, illness or the death of a parent.</TE>
<TE>   Reeling off such like-sounding names becomes a bit of a
tongue-twister. In another industry, such similarities might be the start
of a lawsuit. But not in teddy bear land. Many organizations work closely
with one another, in what Moran calls a "teddy bear network."</TE>
<TE>   "It's kind of like, whenever people need bears, we can contact one
another and ask if they have any to spare," she said. "It's one of the
nicest networks of humanity you can involve yourself in."</TE>
<TE>   The groups have adopted relatively standard requirements for the teddy
bears they seek. In most cases, the stuffed animals must be new, for
health reasons, and less than 15 inches long, to keep down shipping
costs. (Most organizations raise money separately to cover the cost of
distributing the bears.) Almost all of the groups encourage people to
attach a message to the bear so its new owner will know whence it came.</TE>
<TE>   "We get them in all languages," Moran said. "I think the most touching
ones are the ones written by children. They are so sweet and so direct.
They write, 'I know you must be sad, but I will be your friend if you
need one.' "</TE>
<TE>   Some of the bears are store-bought; others are lovingly handcrafted.
But to call them just "stuffed animals" is an affront to some of the bear
collectors, who ascribe more importance to their furry friends.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't call them toys at our house," said Moran. "We call them
counseling assistants or hugs."</TE>
<TE>   In coming months, all the bears donated to Operation Teddy Care will
be sent on to New York, both for children touched by the events of Sept.
11 (those affected directly as well as the children of rescue workers
sent to help at the World Trade Center site) and for the New York schools
most affected by the Nov. 12 crash of American Airlines Flight 587 into a
Queens neighborhood. In the latter effort, Operation Teddy Care is
working with the New York-based Hugs Across America.</TE>
<TE>   "Since Sept. 11, it's been incredible," Moran said. "As fast as they
get here, they are out of here. We still need 10,000 bears, just based on
requests we have pending. They would move out of here in no time."</TE>

<HD>'Mulholland,' 'Lord of Rings' Are Top Picks</HD>
<DH>Awards: National Society of Film Critics and American Film
Institute both name Robert Altman best director in ceremonies on two
coasts.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SUSAN KING</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"Mulholland Dr." and "The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the
Ring" won top picture honors Saturday as film awards were handed out on
two coasts.</LD>
<LD>   In New York, "Mulholland Dr.," David Lynch's offbeat, enigmatic
mystery, was named best picture of 2001 by the National Society of Film
Critics. And in Beverly Hills, the American Film Institute gave top
honors to Peter Jackson's fantasy epic "The Lord of the Rings" in a
televised event--the AFI's first-ever awards ceremony.</LD>
<LD>   For "Mulholland Dr.," which began life as an unsold TV pilot,
Saturday's was the latest honor: The film was chosen best picture by the
New York Film Critics Assn. and has been nominated for a Golden Globe for
best film in the drama category. "The Lord of the Rings," a huge box
office hit, is also a Golden Globe nominee in that category.</LD>
<TE>   Naomi Watts, the star of "Mulholland Dr.," won the society's best
actress honors for her performance as an ingenue who moves to Los
Angeles. Best actor honors went to Gene Hackman for his role in "The
Royal Tenenbaums" as an errant father who wants to make amends with his
family. Hackman was also honored by the AFI for the same part, though the
AFI considered it a "non-leading role."</TE>
<TE>   Steve Buscemi received best supporting actor from the society for his
role as a lonely fortysomething in the comedy-drama "Ghost World." Helen
Mirren, as the no-nonsense head servant who harbors a dark secret in
"Gosford Park," was named best supporting actress.</TE>
<TE>   The society, which consists of 52 of the country's leading movie
critics, held its 36th annual awards ceremony at Sardi's restaurant in
Manhattan.</TE>
<TE>   The AFI awards were handed out at the Beverly Hills Hotel. The awards,
for both film and television, were chosen by a jury of critics, academics
and others. The AFI event was scheduled two weeks before the televised
Golden Globe ceremony Jan. 20 in hopes of generating early award season
excitement in Hollywood. But the show failed to generate much buzz in an
industry that has seen a proliferation of award shows in recent years.</TE>
<TE>   Other big winners chosen by the AFI included best actor Denzel
Washington for his role as a rogue cop in "Training Day," and best
actress Sissy Spacek for her performance as a grieving mother in "In the
Bedroom." In accepting the award, she told the Beverly Hills gathering:
"This film is so close to my heart."</TE>
<TE>   Both the AFI and the society named Robert Altman best director for his
comic murder mystery "Gosford Park." The society had previously named him
best director for his 1975 classic, "Nashville." He was honored in the
same category for "Gosford Park" by the New York Film Critics.</TE>
<TE>   That movie also earned a best screenplay award from the society for
Julian Fellowes.</TE>
<TE>   The AFI screenwriting award went to Christopher Nolan for his
told-backward thriller "Memento." The AFI award for non-leading actress
went to Jennifer Connelly for her role in the true-life drama "A
Beautiful Mind."</TE>
<TE>   In its television awards, the AFI honored "The Sopranos" for best
drama series and "Curb Your Enthusiasm" as best comedy series. Both are
HBO shows.</TE>

<HD>Eye on the Sky Closing</HD>
<DH>Landmark: Thousands flock to Griffith Observatory, which shuts down
today for a 3-year renovation.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAREN BRISCOE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Nostalgia, curiosity, sunny skies and temperatures in the mid-60s
drew thousands of visitors Saturday to the 67-year-old Griffith
Observatory in the hills above Los Angeles.</LD>
<LD>   With a $66-million renovation scheduled, the doors will close with a
ceremony at 10 tonight. The observatory, one of the city's best-known
landmarks, is expected to remain closed for three years.</LD>
<LD>   Since its opening in 1935, the observatory has provided something for
almost everyone.</LD>
<TE>   On Saturday, a grandmother passed down a sense of history, a film
student reflected on the city's icons, a mother tried to slake her two
sons' thirst for knowledge about the sky.</TE>
<TE>   Close to 6 million people have peered through its 12-inch telescope,
more than any other telescope in the world, said Mark Pine, deputy
director of Friends of the Observatory, a nonprofit observatory support
group.</TE>
<TE>   It's been a quintessential L.A. scene-setter in hundreds of movies and
television shows, and site for untold thousands of field trips for
Southern California children. A few of those children may owe their
existence to romances stoked on the observatory's viewing deck, with its
dizzying and panoramic view of the city.</TE>
<TE>   Spurred by the news of the coming shutdown, throngs have been rushing
to beat the clock--or more appropriately, the observatory's Foucault
pendulum--in recent weeks.</TE>
<TE>   "There's been a huge increase in people over the last two weeks," said
Nicholas Novi, a Los Angeles Department of Transportation driver whose
weekend route runs from the Red Line Station at Vermont Avenue and Sunset
Boulevard up to the observatory. Novi, who sometimes visits the
observatory on his days off, said his daily passenger average has
increased from 60 to 80 people per day to nearly 200 over the last two
weeks.</TE>
<TE>   "It's nice that they're renovating it," he said, "but I hope they
don't change it too much."</TE>
<TE>   There are plans for extensive renovations, including cleaning of the
observatory's three copper domes and construction of a new underground
theater named after Leonard Nimoy, of Star Trek fame, who donated $1
million to the project. The plans, however, call for retaining the
observatory's distinctive Art Deco architecture.</TE>
<TE>   Donated to the city by Col. Griffith J. Griffith and designed by
architects John C. Austin and F.M. Ashley, the observatory is listed as
Cultural Heritage Monument No. 168.</TE>
<TE>   That designation was not lost on Emi Ensley, who returned with her two
daughters and nine of her 12 grandchildren Saturday, after Friday's
crowds proved too much.</TE>
<TE>   "It's important to me that my grandchildren learn about landmarks and
history firsthand, not just by seeing it in a book or jumping on the
computer to see a picture of it," she said. Ensley, 52, grew up in Los
Angeles and estimated that she has visited the observatory more than 200
times since her childhood.</TE>
<TE>   Carlos Gonzalez grew up in Los Angeles, but gained a new appreciation
for the observatory when he moved to Arizona to study filmmaking.</TE>
<TE>   "It's in so many old movies, stuff like 'Rebel Without a Cause,' " he
said. "It really represents the city because no matter where you go, it
catches your eye."</TE>
<TE>   Gonzalez, 31, said the observatory is a muse and a good place to bring
friends from out of town when he returns home.</TE>
<TE>   Sonmi Carvalho of Huntington Beach, a first-time visitor, wanted her
two sons, who are fascinated by astronomy, to see the observatory before
it closes.</TE>
<TE>   Eight-year-old Christopher, who can name all of the planets in the
solar system, was transfixed by the gravity well, a curve-sloped cone
that uses steel balls to demonstrate the rotation of planets around the
sun.</TE>
<TE>   On the steps outside the observatory, Sachio Takata, 78, Asaichi
Hieshima, 82, and Yoshi Hieshima, 78, visited their old haunt one more
time. The three friends have been visiting the observatory since before
World War II, when Asaichi and Yoshi, who have been married for 60 years,
were dating. Takata, a widower, used to visit with his wife as well.</TE>
<TE>   "It was cheap," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "It's very romantic," Yoshi said.</TE>
<TE>   The three plan to visit the observatory again when it reopens in 2005.</TE>
<TE>   "If we're still around, we'll come back," Takata said. "But we wanted
to come today," he said. "Just in case."</TE>

<HD>State Sets Aside $200,000 So Irvine Can Lay Groundwork for 'Great
Park'</HD>
<DH>Recreation: The city stands to get the money if March 5 initiative
passes. El Toro airport advocates say they aren't worried.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The Great Park initiative won't come before Orange County voters
for another two months, but the state has already set aside a $200,000
grant to help Irvine with planning it.</LD>
<LD>   The money would come from the state's Natural Resources Infrastructure
Fund. But the city would have to return the money if the initiative,
listed as Measure W on the ballot, failed March 5, said Steven Capps, a
spokesman for the state Department of Parks and Recreation, which would
issue the grant.</LD>
<LD>   The Orange County Central Park and Nature Preserve Initiative would
replace earlier voter-approved and county-backed plans for a commercial
airport at the 4,700-acre former base with a large urban park and other
development. As envisioned by Irvine officials--who hope to annex the
property--the project would rival Central Park in New York, Balboa Park
in San Diego and Golden Gate Park in San Francisco.</LD>
<TE>   Much of south Orange County opposes the airport and has rallied around
the proposed park as a more fitting and environmentally friendly use of
the property. Recent polls have shown that voter support countywide is
waning for the airport design.</TE>
<TE>   "It's significant that we would receive money to work on planning
something that we don't have the legal right to go forward with," said
Irvine Councilman Chris Mears.</TE>
<TE>   "What it suggests is that Sacramento doesn't have to read tea leaves
to figure out what's going to happen in March: Measure W will pass
overwhelmingly; Irvine will press forward with our annexation of the
property; and we will continue to push forward with planning and
developing the park."</TE>
<TE>   Airport supporters, however, say they aren't worried.</TE>
<TE>   The Great Park "isn't real at this point," said Dave Ellis, a
consultant with the Airport Working Group, which backs an airport at the
former base. He also takes issue with the idea that money for the
proposed park would come from a state fund. "I thought we weren't going
to be using any taxpayer dollars to fund the Great Park," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Bruce Nestande, chairman of the pro-airport Citizens for Jobs and the
Economy, said he is disturbed that the state would set aside money for a
park that hasn't even been approved yet.</TE>
<TE>   The $200,000 grant would be used for "advancing the city's planning
activities associated with the proposed Orange County Great Park,"
according to a city report. That includes environmental studies and
design costs.</TE>
<TE>   But it's unlikely that the city will see the money before the
election, Capps said. The City Council will first have to vote to accept
the grant, which it plans to do Tuesday, and file paperwork with the
state, including a detailed description of the park plan. Then the state
will review all the information before releasing the money, Capps said.</TE>
<TE>   Irvine officials say the Great Park would be self-sufficient, with
funding coming from state and federal grants and an estimated $25 million
in annual revenue from existing housing, commercial and agricultural
leases.</TE>
<TE>   Critics of the plan dispute that and point to a study suggesting that
the county would probably spend about $1 million annually on property
maintenance during the first 18 years.</TE>

<HD>After 7 Years, El Toro's Future Is Still in Doubt</HD>
<DH>Reuse: No one can say with certainty what will happen if voters
approve a ballot initiative to abandon airport planning and create a
large park instead.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEAN O. PASCO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Even after spending seven years and $50 million, Orange County
isn't close to settling the question of what to do with the closed El
Toro Marine base. And a March ballot initiative asking voters to halt
planning for an airport and create a large park and nature preserve
instead may only muddy the issue further.</LD>
<LD>   "If Measure W passes, we will have to start the reuse planning process
all over again," Gary Simon, director of the county's El Toro program
office, told county supervisors recently. "It's back to square one."</LD>
<LD>   That's assuming the county would still want the land.</LD>
<TE>   Supervisor Jim Silva, one of the board's pro-airport majority, has
warned that he's inclined to walk away from the base if the initiative
passes. Environmental contamination, he said, could be too expensive to
clean swiftly and completely to build anything other than an airport.</TE>
<TE>   "The county is going to have to make the decision whether to keep the
property or turn it back over to the Navy" after March 5, Silva said.</TE>
<TE>   The implications of the election have triggered a flurry of meetings
from Santa Ana to Washington as government officials grapple with the
prospect that seven years of airport planning could be overturned.
Neither side in the airport fight can say with certainty what would
happen if the measure passes.</TE>
<TE>   Airport foes, however, downplay the delays that would occur by
changing El Toro's blueprints. The current studies already include a park
at El Toro, they said, since the county has been planning to develop park
areas around three sides of the base, with the airport in the middle.</TE>
<TE>   "The Navy will quickly adjust if this initiative passes," said Paul
Eckles, executive director of the El Toro Reuse Planning Authority, a
coalition of southern Orange County cities opposed to an airport. "They
can read the polls too. So what do they do on March 6? They will try to
find the most direct path they can to unload the property with some
legitimate entity."</TE>
<TE>   It's expected that the base will be declared surplus this spring,
meaning that the Navy will have to dispose of it. The county has applied
to become the new owner, with the Federal Aviation Administration as its
sponsor. If the proposed use changes, a new sponsor would have to be
found, most likely the National Park Service.</TE>
<TE>   The Navy could turn over the base with restrictions, including, under
current plans, limiting certain acreage for aviation. If the land were
turned over for an airport and it ultimately wasn't built, the property
would revert to the Navy. Other provisions say that if the land is
transferred for one use but is used for another, the new owner accepts
all liability for the property.</TE>
<TE>   Once the Navy declares the property surplus, negotiations begin for
conveying the land. Under federal law, the Navy must pay for the cleanup,
though the base can be handed over before that happens. Cleanup plans are
based on how much money is authorized by Congress; there is no timetable
for completion.</TE>
<TE>   For seven years, the county and federal government have examined
environmental issues surrounding redevelopment of the base. Those
analyses are contained in three core documents required by law. So far,
the reviews have focused on an airport as the county's preferred use;
none have contemplated ripping up the runways for a park.</TE>
<TE>   "You clearly have to go back to the beginning," said Bruce Nestande, a
former state legislator and county supervisor who chairs Citizens for
Jobs and the Economy, which has promoted an airport at El Toro since
1994.</TE>
<TE>   The environmental analysis for a park is vastly different from that
required for an airport, Nestande said. For example, key areas of the
base haven't been identified for cleanup--including the runways--because
the intent is to continue using the land for an airport.</TE>
<TE>   "The Navy is not going to turn over the property on March 6 for a
park," Nestande said.</TE>
<TE>   Irvine already has declared its desire to assume responsibility for El
Toro. City officials, led by Mayor Larry Agran, drafted a development
plan for the park that includes a central lake, museum, sports fields, a
university campus and other development.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier this month, Irvine voted to begin yet another environmental
review needed before it can apply to annex the property to become part of
the city. The Navy so far has supported the county's control of the land.</TE>
<TE>   Other steps will need to be taken if the base's use should change. The
Board of Supervisors currently is the only entity in control of the
base's fate. Handing that authority to Irvine--or any other entity--would
require approval by the Navy, which also would have to approve the
annexation.</TE>
<TE>   In another twist, if Irvine should take control of the land, it would
not be bound by Measure W: The initiative ties the hands of only the
county on the base's redevelopment. Irvine officials, however, have
pledged to stick to the park plan.</TE>
<TE>   Eckles said two other possibilities exist if the initiative passes.
Airport foes are backing a challenger to board Chairwoman Cynthia P.
Coad, who faces reelection in March. If Fullerton Councilman Chris Norby
is successful, he would become a third vote on the board to pass El Toro
to Irvine.</TE>
<TE>   The other option, Eckles said, would be for the county to expand the
membership of the redevelopment panel to include South County city
officials.</TE>
<TE>   "The reality is that there will be powerful incentives to help us get
to a resolution of this thing," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Going from an airport to a park would require rewriting three key
documents: the base community reuse plan, required by the federal
government and which the county completed in 1996; the environmental
impact report, required by the state and certified by county supervisors
last month; and the environmental impact statement, a joint review by the
Navy and the FAA that is scheduled to be approved this spring.</TE>
<TE>   Anti-airport forces acknowledge those hurdles, but say there is a
precedent for switching uses midstream from an airport to a park:
Homestead Air Force Base in Florida.</TE>
<TE>   The local redevelopment authority there worked for seven years
planning commercial flights at the base, which sits between two national
parks, including the Everglades. The plan was vigorously opposed by
environmentalists, but airport planning continued, including approval of
the federal environmental review.</TE>
<TE>   But President Clinton, as one of his final acts in office, grounded
the airport plan and instructed that areas of the base be turned over
with restrictions against using it for an airport.</TE>
<TE>   Bruce Drum, who headed the base aviation program, said Homestead was
unique for several reasons, including the unprecedented last-minute edict
from the White House. Homestead also remains an active Air Force Reserve
base.</TE>
<TE>   "It is unique, there's no question about it," said Drum, assistant
aviation director for operations at Miami International Airport, five
general-aviation airfields and Homestead.</TE>
<TE>   "Yet it's similar [to El Toro] because of the techniques being used to
fight it and the arguments about quality of life," he said. "That's the
same battle being fought anywhere you want to add a runway."</TE>

<LD>A twin-engine airplane crashed into an empty field while trying to
land at Fullerton Municipal Airport Saturday, killing the pilot and
narrowly missing several nearby homes.</LD>
<LD>   The Cessna Skymaster had taken off from Fullerton at 12:40 p.m. and
was trying to return 20 minutes later when it appeared to lose power and
slammed into the field in Buena Park, less than one mile from the runway.</LD>
<LD>   "It was an awful sight. . . . I could hear the engine sputtering, and
sputtering really hard, and then he just starting turning and turning in
a downward motion. I thought he was doing tricks at first," said Alfredo
Ulloa, who was working at the airport when the plane crashed.</LD>
<TE>   Coroner's investigators were at the crash site Saturday evening.
Investigators did not release the name of the plane's owner.</TE>
<TE>   Although the pilot, whose name was not released, requested permission
to return shortly after takeoff, he did not report engine trouble before
the crash, said Howard Plagens, a National Transportation Safety Board
investigator.</TE>
<TE>   Employees in the Fullerton airport tower were watching the approaching
plane and noticed the plane's landing gear was up. But before they could
contact the pilot, the plane rolled to the right and went into a nose
dive, Plagens said.</TE>
<TE>   The plummeting aircraft narrowly missed several businesses on
Commonwealth Avenue before crashing in a field near several homes. Some
witnesses wondered whether the pilot maneuvered the plane to an
unpopulated area to avoid further injuries.</TE>
<TE>   "Some witnesses told us the pilot turned at the last minute and aimed
at the spot," said Capt. Steve Miller of the Orange County Fire
Authority.</TE>
<TE>   The pilot did not submit a flight plan. It was unclear whether he
intended to travel to another airport or was just out for a Saturday
afternoon flight, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   Because the plane caught fire and was severely damaged, investigators
were unsure if any passengers might have accompanied the pilot on the
flight. The Federal Aviation Administration and NTSB are investigating.</TE>

<HD>Walkers Winning Uphill Battle</HD>
<DH>San Francisco: Activists gain ground in making the city safer for
pedestrians. New rules hike parking fees, add crosswalks, stop some
right-on-red turns.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KAREN ALEXANDER</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL>SAN FRANCISCO
</DL>
<LD>Gleaming bridges and jam-packed cable cars are the most famous
symbols of this crowded, bustling town. But after enduring decades of
perceived indifference, the pedestrians of San Francisco are gaining
significant ground in their efforts to make the city more walkable.</LD>
<LD>   Steeper parking fines, especially for drivers who block the sidewalks,
took effect Jan. 1. Crosswalks have been painted brilliant yellow near
schools and other areas with heavy walking traffic. Even the coveted
right-on-red turn light, a nearly sacrosanct California institution, has
been stripped away at a handful of intersections to help walkers scoot
across more safely.</LD>
<LD>   Pedestrian advocacy groups, PTA activists and senior citizen
organizations attribute their recent successes in San Francisco to a
growing walkers' rights movement statewide. Five years ago, the only
pedestrian group in California was L.A. Walk, said James Corless,
California director of the Surface Transportation Policy Project, a
nationwide group that promotes safe and clean transportation
alternatives.</LD>
<TE>   Now there are more than a dozen throughout California, including a
handful in the Bay Area, and traffic-calming measures are on the agendas
of city councils statewide.</TE>
<TE>   "I do think the tide has turned," Corless said. "So many people are
jumping on board in San Francisco, things have started to shift."</TE>
<TE>   In 2000, 36 pedestrians were killed in collisions in San Francisco. It
was one of the deadliest years in decades and helped galvanize support
for the current reforms. Activists took to dramatizing the deaths by
furtively stenciling body outlines in white paint at intersections where
pedestrians had been killed.</TE>
<TE>   The body count dropped to 26 in 2001, although the number of
pedestrians injured has remained relatively constant over the years--at
about 1,000 per year, said Michael Smith, president of the group Walk San
Francisco.</TE>
<TE>   Across the bay in Berkeley, meanwhile, unconventional new approaches
to walker safety are afoot--with mixed results.</TE>
<TE>   The city trotted out a funky new plan last month to place bins of
bright orange flags at busy intersections. Pedestrians are encouraged to
pick up a flag, wave it high as they cross the street to make themselves
more visible to oncoming traffic, and put it in another bin when they
reach the other side.</TE>
<TE>   But just two days after city officials debuted the flags at the busy
intersection of Claremont Avenue and Russell Street, a 53-year-old
Berkeley woman holding a flag was hit by a Jeep in the marked crosswalk.
The woman was not seriously injured, but the irony of the incident made
it news.</TE>
<TE>   In San Francisco, where 10% of residents walk to work, pedestrians for
years have felt like they face an uphill battle.</TE>
<TE>   "San Francisco is a very political city," said Smith, whose group was
instrumental in pushing for the recent hike in parking fines. "Everybody
says we want to slow down traffic, but there's not that decision to be
spending more on pedestrian safety."</TE>
<TE>   The parking crunch in San Francisco, where registered vehicles
outnumber on-street parking spaces by more than 130,000, led some
motorists to park on sidewalks. With the fine just $25 and enforcement
hit and miss, it was cheaper to risk a ticket than to pay for a garage or
spend time driving around looking for a legal place to park, Smith said.</TE>
<TE>   But the fine was doubled to $50 on Jan. 1, and will increase to $100
over the next three years. The penalty for parking in a school bus
loading zone more than doubled to $50. And parking too close to an
intersection will cost $50, up from $28.</TE>
<TE>   At several intersections across the city, safety groups have
successfully lobbied traffic officials to prohibit motorists from turning
right on a red light--a privilege that Woody Allen once quipped was "the
only cultural advantage" to living in Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Turning right on a red light is illegal at as many as 10% of San
Francisco's 1,100 traffic signal intersections, estimated traffic
engineer Bond Yee. "You mention something like that in Orange County and
you'll probably get lynched," he said.</TE>
<TE>   In front of the towering St. Mary's Cathedral on Geary Boulevard at
Gough Street in San Francisco, the road is four lanes in both directions.
Pedestrians have to stop on a traffic island midway because the light
doesn't stay green long enough to make it across in one attempt.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to the church, there are several retirement homes and a
1,200-student school within a block of the intersection. It is illegal to
turn right on a red light there, but about 1 in 10 cars in the right-turn
lane on a recent afternoon did so anyway.</TE>
<TE>   As an elderly man with a walker crossed the street with Father Julian
Gonzalez, a Franciscan monk who teaches at the nearby school, a yellow
motorcycle in the right lane zipped in front of them to turn on the red
light.</TE>
<TE>   Gonzalez admitted that he too frequently turns right against the red
light at the intersection he had just crossed.</TE>
<TE>   "We're a disobedient city," Gonzalez said. "As a people, we're naughty
here. We're rude drivers, and we need these strict rules. They should
fine us up the ying-yang because people are running red lights
constantly."</TE>
<TE>   When drivers turn right on a red light, they frequently look left to
make sure no other cars are coming but fail to look right again to see if
any pedestrians have stepped off the curb in front of them.</TE>
<TE>   "It really can cause problems for more vulnerable pedestrians, because
drivers are much more focused on looking for other cars," said Joe Kott,
the chief transportation official in Palo Alto, where signs prohibit the
right-on-red turn at about half a dozen intersections.</TE>
<TE>   Yet a study a year ago in San Francisco by the city's Department of
Parking and Traffic concluded that it is actually more dangerous to turn
right on a green light, because cars are likely to be moving at higher
speeds then.</TE>
<TE>   "The whole right-turn-on-red issue is one of those things that have
come to symbolize the change in thinking that is occurring," Corless
said. "It was conceived in order to promote traffic flow. . . . But a lot
of other people would be walking if it were safer, and those initial
people who are out there are enough to warrant protection."</TE>

<LD>Scientists at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory are seeing
stars with a new laser they helped develop that creates the first virtual
star.</LD>
<LD>   The laser is beamed onto a layer of sodium atoms 60 miles above the
Earth in order to measure distortions in the atmosphere.</LD>
<LD>   The orange-tinted virtual star measures only 39 inches in diameter and
is 25 times fainter than anything that can be seen by the unaided eye.</LD>
<TE>   Scientists say it has allowed them to obtain infrared images with four
times better resolution than the Hubble Space Telescope.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>A raw sewage spill into the Russian River continued last week as
state water officials tried to stop the contamination by temporarily
shutting down city water pumps.</LD>
<LD>   "The real concern here is this is pretty much raw waste water," said
John Short, a senior engineer with the North Coast Regional Water Quality
Control Board.</LD>
<LD>   The source of the sewage is a holding pond at a large Salvation Army
housing facility north of Healdsburg. Part of a sewage system built to
accommodate housing and community facilities at the center, it is
believed to have been designed to handle about 9,000 gallons a day, Short
said.</LD>

<LD>New Census Bureau figures show that California is the worst state
in the country when it comes to creating new housing.</LD>
<LD>   Even though the West was the fastest-growing part of the nation from
1990 to 2000, adding 20% to its population, it was the only region to
experience a decline in the number of housing units per person. That
figure for the West fell about 3% during the decade.</LD>
<LD>   "The shortage is a result of not having enough housing built in the
last 10 years," said Freda Radich of the California Department of Housing

<HD>Eugene Nickerson, 83; Federal Judge Ruled Against Pentagon Policy
on Gays</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK
</DL>
<LD>Eugene Nickerson, the first judge to strike down the "don't ask,
don't tell" policy for gays in the U.S. military and who presided over
the Abner Louima police brutality trials, has died. He was 83.</LD>
<LD>   Nickerson, who served 24 years in U.S. District Court in Brooklyn,
died Tuesday of complications from ulcer surgery at St. Luke's Hospital
in Manhattan.</LD>
<LD>   A lawyer by training, Nickerson was the first Democratic politician to
be elected county executive of Nassau County, a Republican stronghold and
one of the most affluent counties in the United States.</LD>
<TE>   Elected in 1961, he served three terms before returning to private law
practice. He became a federal judge in 1977 on the nomination of
President Carter.</TE>
<TE>   Nickerson presided over many prominent cases, including three trials
in which white New York City police officers were charged with torture,
assault and lying in the case of Louima, a black Haitian immigrant. The
off-duty security guard was beaten in August 1997 after being arrested
over a nightclub scuffle and had a broomstick jammed into his rectum
inside a Brooklyn station house.</TE>
<TE>   The case shocked New York, fueled racial tensions in the city and drew
worldwide attention to allegations of brutality and excessive use of
force by police officers.</TE>
<TE>   In 1995, Nickerson became the first judge to strike down a Pentagon
policy under which gays and lesbians could still be expelled from the
military for conduct including declaring their sexual orientation.
Nickerson said that the policy was a violation of free speech. A year
later, a federal appeals panel sent the case back to him, directing him
to assess the constitutionality of the Pentagon's ban on homosexual
activity.</TE>
<TE>   Nickerson again struck down the policy in 1997, this time on the
grounds of equal protection, and rejected the military's argument that
prohibiting homosexual conduct was needed to maintain unit cohesion.</TE>
<TE>   His ruling, however, was overturned by a three-judge appeals court
that upheld the military's ban on homosexual activity and its "don't ask,
don't tell" policy.</TE>
<TE>   Known as an independent-minded judge, Nickerson also ruled in a case
that had major implications for jury selection. That 1983 ruling strayed
from U.S. Supreme Court precedent by barring prosecutors from using
challenges that excluded jurors solely on the basis of race. The Supreme
Court ultimately ruled to stop allowing jurors to be removed on the basis
of race.</TE>
<TE>   He was also involved in trials of Mafia bosses John Gotti and Vincent
Gigante. Gambino crime family head Gotti was acquitted by a jury in a
1987 racketeering trial presided over by Nickerson, but was convicted in
1992 and sentenced to life imprisonment.</TE>
<TE>   In the 1996 trial of Gigante, who was known for wandering the streets
in pajamas and a bathrobe, Nickerson rejected the mobster's claims that
he was not mentally competent to stand trial. Gigante was convicted on
racketeering charges.</TE>
<TE>   Born in Orange, N.J., the son of an Army intelligence officer,
Nickerson graduated from Harvard before going on to law school at
Columbia University, where he was an editor of the law review. He later
clerked for Harlan Fiske Stone, the chief justice of the U.S. Supreme
Court.</TE>
<TE>   Nickerson, a descendant of President John Adams, is survived by his
wife, Marie-Louise; four daughters; three brothers; and five
grandchildren.</TE>

<LD>Aniela Mlynarski Rubinstein, 93, the widow of pianist Arthur
Rubinstein and a charity fund-raiser known as a talented hostess, died
Dec. 31 at her home in Manhattan of causes associated with aging.</LD>
<LD>   As co-founder and frequent chairwoman, she developed the Polonaise
Ball into a successful fund-raiser for relief programs for Polish
refugees. She also supported other Polish charitable organizations and
aided such arts programs as the Four Stars recital series in Paris and
the Rubinstein piano competition in Israel.</LD>
<LD>   Born in Vilnius, Lithuania, she was the daughter of Emil Mlynarski,
founding conductor of the Warsaw Philharmonic and director of the Warsaw
Opera. Her father introduced her to Rubinstein backstage after a concert.</LD>
<TE>   "Nela," as she was known, studied dance in Dresden. A linguist and
artistically knowledgeable, she became a renowned hostess during her
50-year marriage to the pianist at homes they maintained in Paris,
briefly in Hollywood, and in New York and Spain.</TE>

<LD>The Rev. John Randolph Taylor, 72, architect of the reunification
of northern and southern Presbyterian denominations in 1983, died Friday
at his home in Black Mountain, N.C., after suffering from multiple
myeloma and kidney failure.</LD>
<LD>   Taylor was a key leader on the committee working to reunify the
branches into what is now the Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.) and was
elected moderator of the reunified denomination's General Assembly after
the merger. He spent the next year touring the country, working to
strengthen ties in the new denomination.</LD>
<LD>   After that duty, he served as president of San Francisco Theological
Seminary from 1985 until his retirement in 1994. Earlier, Taylor was a
pastor of congregations in Washington, D.C., Charlotte, N.C., and
Atlanta, and participated in the civil rights movement.</LD>
<TE>   He was a fifth-generation minister and son of missionaries to China.</TE>

<DH>Stung Initially by Split With Kwan, Carroll Is Getting On With His
Life and Career</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HELENE ELLIOTT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Frank Carroll was taught by a champion and, in turn, became a
teacher of champions. But he anticipated the crowning moment of his
coaching career would arrive at the Salt Lake City Winter Games, when
Michelle Kwan would ascend to the top of the medal podium after the
Olympic women's figure skating competition.</LD>
<LD>   He would not accompany her on that triumphant climb, of course. But he
would know something of him was with her as she bowed her head to allow
the ribbon and its heavy golden ornament to be slipped around her neck.</LD>
<LD>   That happy dream was shattered in late October, when Kwan told him she
wanted to end their 10-year collaboration, during which she matured from
a skinny jumping bean into a stunning five-time U.S. champion and
four-time world champion. She wanted her independence, she said. She
wanted to control her life and her skating.</LD>
<TE>   Carroll was dumbstruck. He had come so close to being the coach of the
Olympic gold medalist when Linda Fratianne went to the 1980 Lake Placid
Games as the world champion but was beaten by Anett Poetzsch of East
Germany, a verdict he disdains as politically tainted. And even though
Tara Lipinski upset Kwan to win gold at the 1998 Nagano Games, Kwan was
gutsy enough to win the last two world titles and establish herself as
the favorite at Salt Lake City.</TE>
<TE>   How could the Olympic gods deny him again? How could he not have seen
this coming?</TE>
<TE>   "If you spend 10 years with somebody you feel pretty close to them,
and I felt she really trusted anything I said. It was kind of a shock to
find otherwise," he said. "I love Michelle. I care about her. She's a
great human being. I have nothing bad to say about her.</TE>
<TE>   "If there had been an argument or disagreement about her skating, it
would be easy to put your finger on it. We didn't."</TE>
<TE>   A busy schedule got him past his initial shock. He has coached U.S.
men's champion Tim Goebel the past 18 months and recently took on 2001
U.S. bronze medalist Angela Nikodinov, whose coach, Elena Tcherkasskaia,
died of cancer in November.</TE>
<TE>   But Kwan was his shining star, and he will be torn when he watches her
compete this week at the U.S. Figure Skating Championships at Staples
Center and, presumably, next month at Salt Lake City. If the timing of
her decision seems unfair to him, he tries to look beyond that.</TE>
<TE>   "For me, it's really a win-win situation," he said. "I'm not talking
about Michelle in a derogatory fashion, I'm just talking about myself and
my own life and career.</TE>
<TE>   "If Michelle Kwan wins the gold medal, and after all the world
championships I've won with her and the years we've spent together, who
do you think, in the skating world, they're going to attribute that [to]?
If Michelle Kwan doesn't win the gold medal and doesn't skate well at the
Olympics, what are people going to say is the cause or why?</TE>
<TE>   "What am I losing out of this? As far as my own reputation is
concerned, I really don't feel like it's a losing situation."</TE>
<TE>   He pauses.</TE>
<TE>   "Sure, I'd feel left out," he said, "as far as the way I am as a human
being."</TE>
<TE>   Yet, he wouldn't be hurt if she hired another coach. "I think it would
be better for her," he said. "I think it would be very unwise for her to
go to the Olympics without a coach. A real coach."</TE>
<TE>   Kwan's father, Danny, has occupied the coach's spot at her practices
and competitions since she dismissed Carroll, yet they say Danny is not
coaching her. Asked if Danny Kwan had influenced his daughter's decision,
Carroll spoke carefully.</TE>
<TE>   "He's always been there, let's put it that way, and that's no
surprise," Carroll said. "After 10 years, I knew her dad pretty well. I
knew the way things were was the way things were going to be. I never
tried to get between her parents and her because I felt that would be a
losing situation for myself."</TE>
<TE>   Carroll is among the sport's most respected coaches. Regal and
purposeful, he's as exacting with Goebel as he is with the novice skaters
he coaches at HealthSouth Training Center in El Segundo.</TE>
<TE>   Goebel credits Carroll with improving his technique and artistry.</TE>
<TE>   "He's very disciplined and sort of stoic. He doesn't yell and scream
if I have a bad day," Goebel said. "He's always on time and comes to work
every day with a set plan."</TE>
<TE>   Even his most vexatious student, Christopher Bowman, acknowledges a
debt to Carroll. Bowman, known as "Hans Brinker from Hell," was a
brilliant skater who won two U.S. titles and two medals at the world
championships but let substance abuse erode his talent. As a teenager, he
hated Carroll's devotion to tradition. As a coach, he respects it.</TE>
<TE>   "Everything he taught me is something I honor every day I step on the
ice with my students," Bowman said. "I'll say, 'What would Frank do in
this situation? What would he say?"'</TE>
<TE>   Fratianne, whom Carroll described as "the perfect student," still
seeks his counsel.</TE>
<TE>   "My mom and he were very close, and she passed away seven years ago.
Now I kind of joke and call him my surrogate mother," the Northridge
native said. "I can't say enough good things about him.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm the head coach at the rink in Sun Valley. If I ever have a
question about how anything at the rink should be done, I'm always
calling him for advice, things I'd probably call my mother on. He's
always available."</TE>
<TE>   Carroll gives his age as "somewhere between 40 and death," but he is
about 63. He grew up in Worcester, Mass., and skated there before
studying with skating legend Maribel Vinson Owen, whose nine U.S. women's
titles in the 1920s and '30s remains a record.</TE>
<TE>   After a middling competitive career he skated with the Ice Follies but
left the vagabond life in July 1964, when a friend helped him get a
coaching job in Van Nuys. Other friends with Hollywood connections got
him work in the Frankie Avalon-Annette Funicello beach blanket movies
popular at the time.</TE>
<TE>   But don't look for him in the credits. Another Frank Carroll was
registered with the actors' union, so he had to take a stage name--which
he won't reveal.</TE>
<TE>   "That was \o7 so\f7  stupid," he said of his movie career. "I won't
tell anyone my name because I'm afraid the kids will see me."</TE>
<TE>   Skating was his real passion, and as his students began to excel, he
moved from the tiny Van Nuys rink to Pickwick in Burbank. His first
student to earn a berth on the world team was Robert Bradshaw, who was an
Olympic alternate in 1972, second at the U.S. competition in 1973 and
finished 12th at the 1973 world championships.</TE>
<TE>   Fratianne's parents had called him several times to ask if he would
teach their daughter, but he was too busy teaching to respond. Finally,
they went to great lengths to get his attention.</TE>
<TE>   "One day in Van Nuys a little girl came up and started skating big
circles around me and jumping and jumping, and she was cute as a button
and had such spring in her legs. Remarkable spring," he said. "I said,
'My goodness, this little girl could be world champion.'</TE>
<TE>   "As I got off the ice, I sort of thought, 'I wonder if it's those
Fratianne people?' I got off the ice and her father was there and he
said, 'Is my kid good enough for you?' I said, 'Well, I don't know, who's
your kid?' But I knew."</TE>
<TE>   Fratianne, the 1977 and 1979 world champion, brought new athleticism
to the sport with that jumping ability. "They all had to do triples after
Linda," Carroll said. "When Dorothy Hamill won [in 1976], she could do a
double axel. But after Linda won bronze in the free skating and was fifth
overall in her first year at worlds [1976], it was all changed."</TE>
<TE>   Fratianne was expected to prevail at Lake Placid, but Poetzsch, a less
graceful free skater, built a lead in the compulsory figures and held on
to win the gold.</TE>
<TE>   "Back then the politics in skating was such that the sport could be
manipulated," Carroll said.</TE>
<TE>   Fratianne's parents knew of those political games, but they rejected a
chance to fire Carroll a year before the Olympics and hire Carlo Fassi,
who was better connected politically.</TE>
<TE>   "The bottom line, loud and clear, is Frank was my security blanket,"
Fratianne said. "Frank was out there, putting his judgment on the line
for me, and that was all I knew and all I wanted to know.... I have no
regrets at all. This is about 10 years of commitment and loyalty we had
with each other."</TE>
<TE>   Carroll coached 1985 U.S. champion Tiffany Chin for a while, but
Bowman was his joy--and his despair. A child actor with an engaging
personality, Bowman charmed everyone. That included Carroll, until drugs
made Bowman uncontrollable.</TE>
<TE>   Bowman says Carroll, unmarried and childless, couldn't relate to him
because his problems "took more parenting skill than coaching skill." Not
that his parents could rein him in, either, but he felt Carroll's natural
reserve kept them apart.</TE>
<TE>   "You didn't have that, 'Yeah I love him like a father,' though in a
lot of ways I spent more time with him than with my own father," Bowman
said. "But it wasn't like Cus D'Amato and Mike Tyson, the trainer who
adopted him and took him in....</TE>
<TE>   "He was the teacher. He was the master. He was not the baby sitter.
Not the diaper-changer. He was only there for one thing. It's not that he
didn't care, he just cares about skating."</TE>
<TE>   Carroll ran out of patience with Bowman by 1990, but didn't have long
to wait for his next champion.</TE>
<TE>   On the advice of Fratianne's mother, Virginia, Carroll met Kwan's
father, Danny, at the 1992 Pacific Coast Sectional competition in 1992.
Seeing Michelle was Carroll's third thunderbolt, the third time, after
Fratianne and Bowman, he looked at a young skater and thought "world
champion."</TE>
<TE>   His vision came true, and they were so successful a team that even
after Kwan won silver to Lipinski's gold at Nagano, their bond seemed
unbreakable.</TE>
<TE>   He knew her well, and so wasn't worried when she opened this season
with so-so performances at the Goodwill Games and the Masters of Figure
Skating in San Diego. He thought all she needed was a change in her
schedule, perhaps a return to the exercise regimen that had worked for
her last year. Or even a review of old videotapes of herself.</TE>
<TE>   "Nothing, I think, that would be rattling," he said.</TE>
<TE>   But then she rattled the skating world by saying she would skate by
herself for a while, and then indefinitely.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of people are shaking their heads," Fratianne said. "Frank
Carroll is an unbelievable coach and he absolutely knows what it takes to
be an Olympic champion."</TE>
<TE>   Carroll and Kwan rarely see each other. She usually trains at Lake
Arrowhead and he is at El Segundo, teaching Goebel, Nikodinov, Lloyd and
others. It's to them he now passes on the legacy of Maribel Vinson
Owen."I'm sort of the last of a generation," he said, "and that's kind of
scary in a way because it's something I never intended to have happen."</TE>
<TE>   He didn't intend to lose Kwan, either, but his spirit remains
unbroken.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm teaching a little girl who doesn't know her left foot from her
right foot and doesn't know one edge from another. But she's cute. I make
her keep a notebook and write everything down. I write in it and she
writes in it."</TE>
<TE>   And maybe she will be the champion who doesn't break his heart.</TE>

<HD>Raiders Lack the Look of a Champion</HD>
<DH>NFL: Three losses in last five games make today's finale, against
Jets, important for AFC West titlists.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SAM FARMER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>OAKLAND</DL>
<LD>A field goal here, a tackle there, and today's game would have been
little more than a tuneup for the Oakland Raiders.</LD>
<LD>   Instead, the AFC West champion Raiders, who have lost three of five,
need to beat the New York Jets to better their playoff position. For a
first-round bye, the Raiders need to win and get either a victory by New
England or a loss by Miami. The Patriots play at Carolina and the
Dolphins host Buffalo.</LD>
<LD>   Although they looked like the AFC's best team midway through the
season, the Raiders have slipped in recent weeks with losses to Arizona,
Tennessee and Denver. Still, hope springs eternal in Raiderland.</LD>
<TE>   "As long as you have a chance to breathe and fight another day in this
league, you have to have a smile on your face," tight end Roland Williams
said. "There are some teams in this league right now that don't have a
chance to fight.</TE>
<TE>   "I think we're a scrappy bunch. I think we're going to get it right
and shock the world."</TE>
<TE>   And the football world will be watching the Raider-Jet game, the
weekend's only contest with playoff implications for both teams. The Jets
will clinch a postseason berth with a victory over the Raiders, or a loss
by Seattle, which hosts Kansas City.</TE>
<TE>   The Raiders got a big boost Friday, emotional and otherwise, when
Jerry Rice returned to the team after spending time in Mississippi with
his father, who is hospitalized with heart problems. Rice, a key
component to a pass-heavy offense, will start today.</TE>
<TE>   "I felt like I needed to be there [in Mississippi]," Rice told
reporters. "He's starting to recuperate, so that's a load off my mind."</TE>
<TE>   The Jets are 6-1 on the road and have allowed more than 18 points only
once in the last nine games.</TE>
<TE>   The Seahawks, who beat San Diego last Sunday with a 54-yard field goal
as time expired, have hope. They can clinch a wild-card spot with a
victory, and a loss by the Jets or Baltimore, which hosts Minnesota on
Monday night.</TE>
<TE>   The Jets and Ravens are in the playoffs with a victory, or a Seattle
loss. The way Baltimore tight end Shannon Sharpe sees it, the playoffs
are a golden opportunity and he's not looking for them to arrive on a
silver platter.</TE>
<TE>   "I hope we have to win Monday night to get in the playoffs," he said.
"I want Seattle and the Jets to win [today]. I don't want to get in
because somebody else is unfortunate."</TE>
<TE>   Miami and New England are playoff-bound, but the AFC East crown is up
for grabs.</TE>
<TE>   The Patriots have the tiebreaker advantage. If both teams lose, and
the Jets win, the Jets win the division.</TE>
<TE>   Pittsburgh lost to Cincinnati last Sunday, but the AFC Central
champion Steelers locked up a first-round bye and home-field advantage
through the playoffs when Oakland lost to Denver.</TE>
<TE>   All six NFC playoff berths are set, but there is plenty of jostling
for position.</TE>
<TE>   Chicago can win the NFC Central with a victory over Jacksonville,
whereas Green Bay can win it with a victory over the New York Giants and
a Bear loss.</TE>
<TE>   Only momentum is at stake when Philadelphia plays at Tampa Bay. It's a
dress rehearsal for the teams, which will meet in Philadelphia in the
first round.</TE>
<TE>   The 49ers will have to go on the road for the first round unless they
win at New Orleans and the Packers lose.</TE>
<TE>   St. Louis, NFC West champion, has clinched a first-round bye and can
shore up home-field advantage through the playoffs with a victory over
Atlanta or a Chicago loss.</TE>
<TE>   An intriguing possibility: If Tampa Bay beats Philadelphia in a
wild-card game, the Buccaneers would travel to St. Louis to face the Rams
(assuming the Rams are the top-seeded team). Earlier this season, Tampa
Bay beat the Rams on "Monday Night Football," and each of their three
games over the past three seasons were decided by a touchdown or less.</TE>
<TE>   Then again, Tampa Bay has never won a road playoff game, and the
Buccaneers--who will be playing at Philadelphia--are 0-20 when the
temperature dips below 40 degrees at kickoff.</TE>
<TE>   Regardless, Ram Coach Mike Martz refuses to look that far down the
road.</TE>
<TE>   "This team's always been able to focus on the task at hand," he said.</TE>
<TE>   (BEGIN TEXT OF INFOBOX / INFOGRAPHIC)</TE>
<TE>Bubble Dwellers</TE>
<TE>   The NFC teams are set for the playoffs with only home field and
first-round byes to be determined today. The AFC has three teams fighting
for two berths:</TE>
<TE>   * NEW YORK JETS--First it was Carson Palmer, now it's Vinny Testaverde
who is struggling under former USC coach and current Jet assistant Paul
Hackett. Testaverde must manage burden better than Palmer did for Jets to
advance.</TE>
<TE>   * BALTIMORE--Ravens get in for sure with a win or tie against the
Minnesota Vikings. If they lose, they need help. Problem is, their game
is Monday night, and those are the ones for which Randy Moss and his ego
get motivated.</TE>
<TE>   * SEATTLE--Even if they win they need other teams to lose to reach the
playoffs. But a coach who starts Shaun Alexander at running back only
when over-the-hill Ricky Watters is injured doesn't deserve to have a
team in the postseason anyway.</TE>

<DH>Tara Lipinski, With Eyes on a Career in Acting, Is Enjoying Her
Life After Olympics</DH>
<SE></SE>

<LD>Tara Lipinski knows exactly how the competitors at this week's U.S.
Figure Skating Championships feel as they await the moment when they put
their dreams on the line and vie for a national title, as well as a berth
on the Olympic team for the Salt Lake City Games.</LD>
<LD>   "Nervous. Big time nervous," she said. "It's so frustrating because
you want it so bad and you know what you have to do to win, and time
passes so slowly.</LD>
<LD>   "I feel blessed that I did it and accomplished what I wanted to do."</LD>
<TE>   And even more blessed that she's not doing it again.</TE>
<TE>   Four years after she followed a runner-up finish at the 1998 U.S.
championships by upsetting Michelle Kwan and winning the gold medal at
the Nagano Olympics, Lipinski is coping with a hip problem that requires
daily therapy and constant monitoring. Doctors who performed a 31/2-hour
operation to remove torn cartilage overgrowing the bone of her right hip
found the 19-year-old from Sugar Land, Texas, also had developed
arthritis from the years of strain and pounding that led to her golden
moment.</TE>
<TE>   "It's from so much jumping," said Lipinski, who experienced mild pain
at Nagano and was later mistakenly told she had a back injury that would
ease if she strengthened her muscles. "It's called hip dysplasia, from
all the triple-triples I was doing on my right side. I probably would
have been fine after surgery, but because I had skated with it for four
years and was misdiagnosed, there was some cartilage damage....</TE>
<TE>   "I trained very hard and needed to be able to do a triple loop-triple
loop [to get high technical marks]. It was worth it, and I'm glad I did
it."</TE>
<TE>   More than 15 months after her surgery, Lipinski is touring with Stars
on Ice but still can't do all the triple jumps she used to reel off with
such youthful abandon and apparent ease. When she carried the Olympic
torch in downtown Houston a few weeks ago, she walked her three-block leg
instead of jogging or running, although she was so thrilled she probably
didn't feel her feet touch the ground at all.</TE>
<TE>   "That was pretty cool," she said, "especially in my hometown. I'm
patriotic and I loved doing it."</TE>
<TE>   Her patriotism had been heightened by a visit to the site of the World
Trade Center, a tragedy that hit her hard because she spent last summer
living in Manhattan and thoroughly enjoyed the city's rhythm. In tribute
to the Sept. 11 victims and their families, she performs a routine in the
show to selections of patriotic music.</TE>
<TE>   "My mom, when she was my age, used to work near there," Lipinski said
of the devastated area, "and my grandfather was a fireman. It really made
me realize how fragile everybody and everything is. It's kind of
emotional, and on behalf of everybody, I'm trying to say we should have
faith."</TE>
<TE>   In her new world of shows, pro-am competitions and made-for-TV events
that stress entertaining audiences instead of impressing judges, Lipinski
can draw on emotion and finesse and be a winning performer without
performing six or seven triple jumps in her routines. Unlike
Olympic-eligible skating, in which Kwan, Sarah Hughes, Sasha Cohen and
Angela Nikodinov push each other to ever higher levels of technical
difficulty, Lipinski can get by for now on charm, sass and the few triple
jumps that don't hurt her hip, the triple toe loop and triple salchow.</TE>
<TE>   She has also been honing her artistry with choreographer Lori Nichol,
who designed some of Kwan's most memorable programs and still works with
U.S. men's champion Tim Goebel and world pairs champions Jamie Sale and
David Pelletier.</TE>
<TE>   "This is the first year I ever got to work with someone," she said.
"Usually, I got a program and that was it. She's really helped me get an
edge."</TE>
<TE>   No one will complain if she doesn't do a triple loop because her hip
is too sore. For that matter, if her hip hurts too much to skate, she can
take a day off.</TE>
<TE>   She couldn't have done that if she had pursued a second consecutive
gold medal and continued competing in Olympic-directed events such as the
U.S. and World Championships. She was young enough to contemplate that
possibility after Nagano, where she was the youngest Olympic champion
ever at 15 years 8 months old. But ending a brilliant career in which she
began the sport and reached its apex in a mere three years, she chose to
give up her Olympic eligibility.</TE>
<TE>   She has never looked back, satisfied knowing her performance at the
Olympics was her best, a moment she might never have topped.</TE>
<TE>   "I have not one ounce of regret," said Lipinski, who shares marquee
billing in Stars on Ice with 1984 and 1988 gold medalist Katarina Witt,
1992 Olympic gold medalist Kristi Yamaguchi, 1998 men's gold medalist
Ilia Kulik and four-time world champion Kurt Browning. The 61-city tour,
which began late last month, will reach the Arrowhead Pond Jan. 19 and
Staples Center Jan. 20.</TE>
<TE>   "The main reason I'm happy with my decision is because of my parents,"
she added, referring to the separation her family endured while she
trained near Detroit and lived with her mother, leaving her father in
Houston. "They're together, and I've never seen them so happy. I couldn't
see living apart from Dad for another four years. And I can just go out
now and have fun.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm kind of used to touring and performing now. When I started, I was
thinking, 'I know what this is all about.' But it's so different from
what I had been doing. Before, I was doing a program and there were
judges and competition. Now, it's more for fun."</TE>
<TE>   Facing physical limitations is no fun, at 19 or any other age.
Lipinski defied her doctors' orders to take her rehabilitation slowly and
skated a week after her surgery, but she has since learned to listen to
her body, if not to her medical team.</TE>
<TE>   "It's something I have to deal with every day," she said. "It's
actually so much better now than it was."</TE>
<TE>   While she learns to make the best of her situation, she's also
expanding her horizons and exploring new interests.</TE>
<TE>   She has stepped up her acting career and spent last summer in Paris
co-starring as a college student in a still-unreleased independent film
called "The Metro Chase." As far as movies go, she has an edge over 1960
Olympic gold medalist Carol Heiss, whose career consisted of one film
with the Three Stooges, but she remains well short of the film legacy of
three-time Olympic gold medalist Sonja Henie, who starred in many hugely
popular cinematic skating extravaganzas.</TE>
<TE>   "I had so much fun," said Lipinski, who previously had a recurring
role on the daytime drama "The Young and the Restless," besides appearing
in "Touched by an Angel" and "Will and Grace." However, her cameo
appearance with Cameron Diaz in a party scene in the current release
"Vanilla Sky" ended up on the cutting room floor.</TE>
<TE>   "I've been acting for four years and I'm taking more challenging
things," she added. "I'm taking acting lessons. I have a coach and I work
with her all the time. Another reason I turned pro is so I can do things
like this and pursue other dreams. There are lots of new things I'd like
to try."</TE>
<TE>   All those interests and the Stars on Ice tour make it difficult for
her to pay close attention to what's going on in the so-called amateur
ranks. She will probably be traveling, skating or preparing to skate
while most of this week's U.S. Championships are taking place, but she
doesn't feel she's missing something vitally important. For her, it's
part of her old life.</TE>
<TE>   "I know most of the people, so it's not like there's anyone new who
has come along," she said. "But it's not like I sit home and watch the
Grand Prix final."</TE>
<TE>   She politely declined to predict who will win the U.S. Championships
or the Olympics, and she's not sure she will be in Salt Lake City next
month to watch the coronation of the her successor as the Olympic
champion. She might attend the Games on behalf of one of her sponsors,
although the Stars on Ice schedule is tight and might not allow for that.</TE>
<TE>   "That would be pretty cool," she said, repeating a favorite phrase. "I
have great memories. You don't just pass on the title--it's more like
you're joining a club, and I can now say I'm in this special club that
not a lot of people are in."</TE>

<HD>Winter Green Fuels Games</HD>
<DH>Olympics: Salt Lake City price tag is at least $1.9 billion, and
the taxpayers' share is causing controversy.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ALAN ABRAHAMSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>LAUSANNE, Switzerland</DL>
<LD>The Salt Lake City Winter Games will be very, very expensive. How
expensive? Depends on who is doing the math.</LD>
<LD>   The last Olympics to be held in the United States for at least 10
years will cost at least $1.9 billion--and may be the most expensive
Winter Games ever staged. That figure reveals the staggering growth in
the scope and size of the Games over the past two decades even as it
underscores a growing controversy about taxpayers' role in funding a U.S.
Olympics.</LD>
<LD>   Salt Lake Organizing Committee President Mitt Romney and International
Olympic Committee President Jacques Rogge say it would be impossible to
stage the Olympics without government support. Such investment leaves a
"great legacy" to Olympic cities, Rogge asserted: "These are not wasted
funds."</LD>
<TE>   But others, including Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), have criticized the
rising costs, particularly taxpayers' share. Direct federal, state and
local funding of the Salt Lake Olympics totals $622 million.</TE>
<TE>   "It's outrageous, disgraceful and obscene," McCain said. "It was very
small in the beginning, then it got bigger and then it got bigger."</TE>
<TE>   Precisely how big, however, is open to debate.</TE>
<TE>   There are several reasons why: No central financial clearinghouse
exists. Certain numbers are difficult if not impossible to independently
verify, especially when foreign host cities are involved. And there is
sharp dispute about whether to lump operating and capital expenses
together--or to include any spending that affects the Games, even if
indirectly or tenuously.</TE>
<TE>   Some critics say the $1.9-billion figure is actually too low--that it
ought to include government-funded road and rail projects in and around
Salt Lake. Doing so would push the tab closer to $3 billion.</TE>
<TE>   The current focus on U.S. taxpayer spending promises to spark a debate
over the Olympic bid process in the United States, which until now has
received little, if any, attention.</TE>
<TE>   Certain figures are, however, plain:</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. government will directly provide the Salt Lake City Games
with nearly $400 million in funding. A significant piece of it is
earmarked for security, and includes $55 million set aside to further
increase security in the wake of Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   State and local government funding totals $225 million. That money
goes toward projects such as student residences at the University of
Utah, which will be used during the Games for Olympic housing. Funds will
also be used for a bus transportation network during the Games, which
begin Feb. 8.</TE>
<TE>   The vast majority of the funding will come from the private committee
that runs the Games, the Salt Lake Organizing Committee, which is
expected to spend $1.3 billion.</TE>
<TE>   In all, direct Games costs thus total roughly $1.9 billion--of which
taxpayers are picking up about $622 million, or 32%.</TE>
<TE>   Some say the Olympic accounting should include indirect costs,
specifically an additional $1.1 billion in government funding allocated
to work on Interstate 15 and a light-rail system called TRAX that now
cuts through downtown Salt Lake. These projects would have been done
regardless of the Olympics but were accelerated because of the Games.</TE>
<TE>   Others, including Romney, the SLOC president, sharply disagree with
such calculations.</TE>
<TE>   "The federal government is a huge financial partner in the Olympics,"
Romney said. "The figure doesn't need to be exaggerated to make that
point."</TE>
<TE>   The challenge of reckoning how to figure Olympic spending is nothing
new.</TE>
<TE>   The 1976 Montreal Olympics, for instance, are often remembered for a
nearly $1-billion deficit. Most of that was for construction cost
overruns that dogged local governments for years.</TE>
<TE>   But the local organizing committee budget--the operating
budget--actually showed a surplus, according to an official Olympic
history.</TE>
<TE>   The accounting and categorizing challenge in Salt Lake can perhaps
best be illustrated by assessing the work on I-15, the state's main
north-south highway.</TE>
<TE>   It runs just west of downtown Salt Lake City. As with the light-rail
system, Olympic authorities in Salt Lake did not ask for the I-15 work,
Romney emphasized.</TE>
<TE>   Is it necessary for the Games? No.</TE>
<TE>   Will it help expedite traffic flow during the Games? Absolutely.</TE>
<TE>   Does the work make it easier already for commuters driving to Salt
Lake from Ogden to the north or Provo from the south? Indisputably.</TE>
<TE>   "It is intellectually, financially and politically unsound to add up a
bunch of projects that are used for 17 days for the Games and then
benefit the community for years beyond and say these are costs directly
attributable to the Olympics," IOC member Dick Pound of Canada said when
the issue arose during a recent IOC meeting here.</TE>
<TE>   What the competing figures make abundantly clear is the incredible
growth in the Games, particularly when the 2002 Olympics are measured
against the 1980 Lake Placid Games, the most recent Winter Games to be
held in the United States.</TE>
<TE>   In 2001 dollars, after accounting for inflation, it cost $363 million
to plan and stage the Lake Placid Olympics, according to a General
Accounting Office report, which many believe is the most accurate
accounting available.</TE>
<TE>   At $1.9 billion, it will cost more than five times more to stage the
2002 Games than it did the 1980 Winter Olympics.</TE>
<TE>   Additional points of contrast:</TE>
<TE>   *The Lake Placid Organizing Committee's budget was $121 million;
SLOC's, at $1.3 billion, is 10 times greater. A significant chunk of the
escalation is due to technology costs, Romney and others said.</TE>
<TE>   *There were 1,072 athletes from 37 countries taking part in 38 events
in Lake Placid; 14 of the 38 were for women. Salt Lake is expecting 2,400
athletes from about 80 countries, and they will participate in 78
events--34 of which will be for women.</TE>
<TE>   *Lake Placid held no Paralympics competition for disabled athletes;
Salt Lake will, with a budgeted cost of $60 million. Indeed, the 2002
Winter Paralympic Games are larger than the 1980 Lake Placid Olympics
when measured by number of athletes and sports.</TE>
<TE>   *Security costs paid by the U.S. government in Lake Placid amounted to
$23 million; those Games were held only eight years after the massacre of
11 Israeli athletes and coaches at the 1972 Munich Games, the event that
ever after made security the No. 1 issue in pre-Games planning. Salt
Lake's bill already is 10 times greater.</TE>
<TE>   "The world has changed since Lake Placid in ways that make the Games
much more expensive," Romney said.</TE>
<TE>   Such data would seem to bolster IOC President Rogge's oft-stated
ambition to limit the size and scope of the Games.</TE>
<TE>   Rogge, a Belgian elected in July to an eight-year term, has said he
wishes to take the Olympic Games to places they have not yet been
held--for instance, to stage the Summer Games in Latin America or Africa.</TE>
<TE>   Escalating costs make such an undertaking impossible to realize for
most developing nations. An exception: Beijing won the 2008 Games earlier
this year after pledging to spend $14.3 billion in the next seven years
for sports facilities as well as highway construction and a massive
subway extension. Some reports now fix Chinese spending linked to the
2008 Games at $24 billion. This coming fall, the U.S. Olympic Committee
will pick one of four U.S. cities to be the sole American candidate to
host the 2012 Games. In the running are New York, San Francisco,
Washington D.C. and Houston. Romney, McCain and others question why the
U.S. government isn't involved in that decision-making process.</TE>
<TE>   Traditionally, the decision has been entirely within the USOC's
purview. Sandra Baldwin, the USOC president, declined to comment on the
issue.</TE>
<TE>   "The federal government should have some role, and perhaps it's only
an input role, in evaluating U.S. bid cities," Romney said.</TE>
<TE>   "We should have a seat at the table," McCain said. "We should have a
say.'</TE>

<HD>Now, Disney Plays to Win</HD>
<DH>Analysis: Entertainment conglomerate has realized the hard way that
good teams are best sports-marketing tools.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BILL SHAIKIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Once upon a time, Disney pitched an entertainment spectacular from
the time you parked your car at the game. Now, after Tony Tavares
resigned Friday as president of its Anaheim Sports division, Disney
acknowledges that laser shows and rappelling mascots do not compel fans
to pay premium prices to watch crummy teams.</LD>
<LD>   "It's a bit of a misnomer to say that there's some magic marketing
approach that Disney has that can be a panacea," said Paul Pressler,
chairman of Disney's parks and resorts division and, until Friday,
Tavares' boss.</LD>
<LD>   "It takes a great film, a great show, a great ride, a great team.
Marketing just helps communicate that."</LD>
<TE>   Tavares, who ran the Angels and Ducks, said the same thing for the
last few years. Pressler's personal interest in revitalizing the Angels
and Ducks, even if only to make the money-losing teams more attractive to
potential buyers, adds luster to teams that had been treated as corporate
orphans and adds corporate clout to the promise to long-suffering fans.</TE>
<TE>   "If we build a competitive team, they will come," Pressler said.
"We're really focused on that."</TE>
<TE>   Tavares had operated the teams with relative autonomy until last year,
when a corporate reorganization resulted in his reporting to Pressler.
Recently, as negotiations to sell the Angels to Florida Marlin owner John
Henry collapsed, and the fan base contracted further, Pressler took his
seat at the Angels' decision-making table.</TE>
<TE>   While Tavares negotiated a buyout of the final two years of his
contract, and took the public criticism for calling off a trade that
would have sent outfielder Darin Erstad to the Chicago White Sox for
prospects, Pressler was behind the scenes, involving himself in the
decisions to scrap the trade, spend $24 million on free-agent pitcher
Aaron Sele, swap disgruntled slugger Mo Vaughn to the New York Mets for
pitcher Kevin Appier and authorize the pursuit of another hitter.
Pressler acknowledged Tavares' resignation reflected that Disney was not
close to selling either team.</TE>
<TE>   "But, more important, I don't think you go out and sign Sele and do
the Appier deal and keep Darin Erstad if you were [on the verge of
selling]," Pressler said. "As long as we own these teams, we have to do
the best job we can at putting a competitive team on the field and on the
ice."</TE>
<TE>   That could be bad news for Duck President and General Manager Pierre
Gauthier, who also lost some autonomy with Pressler's ascendance.
Pressler speaks enthusiastically of Gauthier and Angel General Manager
Bill Stoneman, far more enthusiastically than he ever spoke of Tavares.
But, when Pressler turns his attention from the Angels to the Ducks, he
will examine a team last in the NHL in attendance and on track to finish
last in its division for the third consecutive season.</TE>
<TE>   Disney is often criticized for not spending freely on its teams, but
the Ducks had the eighth-highest payroll in the NHL last season and spent
more per point than any team except the New York Rangers.</TE>
<TE>   Pressler said he would conduct a national search for a replacement for
Tavares, but not in any hurry. Pressler, the former president of
Disneyland, first wants to evaluate the business operations of Anaheim
Sports, to be run on an interim basis by three vice presidents.</TE>
<TE>   "I will be spending more time with the teams to assess the competency
of the talent and what we need," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Corporate interest is a good start. Disney, weary of negative
publicity surrounding the teams, years ago changed the name of its sports
division from Disney Sports to Anaheim Sports. In recent months, a
publicist at Disney's corporate headquarters in Burbank asked a reporter
why stories about the woes of the Angels and Ducks inevitably included
references to Disney.</TE>
<TE>   And, for a company that all but invented the word "synergy," Disney
has been strangely reluctant to share its beloved characters and theme
parks with its sports teams. Fred Flintstone wanders the grounds of
Turner Field before AOL Time Warner's Atlanta Braves play, but Mickey
Mouse rarely visits Edison Field. Fans can buy Brave tickets and
merchandise at CNN Center in downtown Atlanta, but Disneyland does not
sell Angel merchandise, and the park's Web site makes no mention of the
Angels.</TE>
<TE>   With a bittersweet chuckle, one baseball executive noted Disney's best
use of baseball for corporate synergy does not involve the Angels.</TE>
<TE>   Disney's Wide World of Sports complex in Orlando includes the spring
training home of the Braves, another attraction for fans and families
visiting Disney World.</TE>
<TE>   Amid the euphoria that surrounded Disney's purchase of the Angels in
1996, Tavares virtually guaranteed that the world-renowned entertainment
company would revive a franchise slumbering in the final years of Autry
family ownership.</TE>
<TE>   "If they can average 2.5 million fans with a marketing effort that was
not viewed by their peers as being exceptional," Tavares said at the
time, "then with our marketing skills I feel confident we'll be able to
get [almost] 3 million people a year."</TE>
<TE>   Tavares said it, but everyone thought it and assumed it, including his
corporate bosses and officials from the city of Anaheim. The city paid
$20 million toward Disney's stadium renovation; Disney agreed to pay the
city $2 for each admission beyond 2.6 million.</TE>
<TE>   The city has yet to make a dime that way. Under Disney, the Angels
have failed to draw more than 2.5 million to Edison Field.</TE>
<TE>   "When you cut to the chase, the product you put on the field or on the
ice is what determines how many people you have in the stands," Tavares
said Friday. "You can market until you're blue in the face. If you don't
have products that people believe are high-quality products, if people
believe you're headed in the wrong direction for whatever reason, they're
not going to buy tickets."</TE>
<TE>   The Ducks, once the darlings of the NHL, play to a half-empty arena,
with an average ticket price of $50.66.</TE>
<TE>   "We haven't had sustained winning with the Ducks or the Angels,"
Tavares said. "As a result, especially with the Ducks where the situation
is more price sensitive, people are saying when you put a product on the
ice that is highly competitive and we can expect will be in the playoffs
every year, we'll come back. But, at the type of ticket prices you get in
the NHL, people are much more discriminating."</TE>
<TE>   Yet, barring continued deficit spending, the Angel and Duck revenues
would appear to preclude Disney from assembling a winning team and
keeping it together. Disney Chairman Michael Eisner once said he did not
regret buying the Angels instead of the Dodgers, but the Dodgers last
year took in $52 million more than the Angels, according to figures
released by Commissioner Bud Selig.</TE>
<TE>   With the labor agreement expired in baseball, and two years from
expiration in the NHL, both sports must wrestle with issues of
competitive balance. Tavares pointed to the Oakland Athletics, who
qualified for the playoffs in consecutive years but have now lost first
baseman Jason Giambi, closer Jason Isringhausen and outfielder Johnny
Damon in free agency.</TE>
<TE>   "For a couple years they had that window of opportunity," Tavares
said. "What you won't see is any team that's at an economic disadvantage
building a dynasty anymore. The clubs that have the most money are the
teams that will dominate the leagues under the current systems.... Both
commissioners have their hands full trying to get the situation back to
where there's true competitive balance."</TE>
<TE>   With several potential buyers complaining that Disney's asking price
for the Angels is too high, Tavares suggested Pressler's moves reflect
the realization that buyers will not pay a premium for a losing team with
an evaporating fan base.</TE>
<TE>   "It's much easier to sell a winning franchise than a losing
franchise," Tavares said, "and I say that with finances in mind.</TE>
<TE>   "You're not going to go hog wild and drive your losses up
exponentially. These moves haven't done that. I think they have an
opportunity now to compete with anybody in the [American League] West,
and I say that with one hesitation. I, like everybody else, would like to
see one more bat in this lineup, and Bill [Stoneman] is trying to get
that done."</TE>

<HD>Win Really Hits the Spot for Clippers</HD>
<DH>Pro basketball: McInnis, in right place at right time, makes
three-pointer to beat Bucks, 86-83.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELLIOTT TEAFORD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Sometimes the Clippers toyed with the Milwaukee Bucks. At other
times the Clippers appeared vastly inferior to the Bucks. At the end,
though, the Clippers simply shot them down.</LD>
<LD>   Jeff McInnis' three-point basket from straight away with 1.5 seconds
remaining made the Clippers 86-83 winners Saturday over the Bucks before
a crowd of 19,232 at Staples Center, a franchise-record fifth sellout in
a row and the ninth this season.</LD>
<LD>   The Clippers built an 18-point lead in the first half, but watched it
slip away slowly and steadily in the second. Milwaukee led several times
late, but never by more than three points.</LD>
<TE>   Lamar Odom's driving scoop shot erased the Bucks' final lead, giving
the Clippers an 81-80 advantage with less than a minute to play. Corey
Maggette's twisting layup moments later extended the lead to 83-80.</TE>
<TE>   But Tim Thomas swished a three-pointer over Odom from the right wing
on the Bucks' next possession, tying the score and setting up a dramatic
final 14.5 seconds for McInnis and the Clippers.</TE>
<TE>   "Honestly, I just shot it, man," McInnis said when asked if he knew
the ball was going in when it left his hands.</TE>
<TE>   The Bucks appeared to have the Clippers bottled up. Odom had the ball
on the left wing and attempted to drive to the hoop, but Buck defenders
surrounded him. They also left McInnis alone out front. Odom whipped a
pass to McInnis, who made only his third shot in nine attempts.</TE>
<TE>   "I got to the right spot and he found me," McInnis said of Odom. "I
didn't know quite where I was, but I knew if he found me I'd have to
shoot it. I didn't know if it was a two or a three."</TE>
<TE>   After calling their final timeout, the Bucks set up a play with 1.5
seconds left.</TE>
<TE>   Michael Redd came around a screen, but his three-point attempt fell
short at the buzzer. The Clippers pulled out their second nail-biter in
as many nights. Friday, they defeated the Nuggets at Denver, 82-80.</TE>
<TE>   In defeating the Bucks, the Clippers withstood 24 points from Ray
Allen and 20 from Sam Cassell. All of Cassell's points came in the second
half. Odom had 18 points to lead the Clippers.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a great sign," McInnis said of finding ways to win two in a row
late. "We would have lost a game like this one in the past. I think it's
a sign we're maturing as a team."</TE>
<TE>   The Clippers beat a hasty retreat from Denver, where they didn't
exactly swell with confidence after stealing away with a victory Friday.
Relieved was perhaps the only way to describe them.</TE>
<TE>   Saturday, back in town to face Central Division leader Milwaukee at
Staples Center before hitting the road again for a six-game trip, the
Clippers seemed at ease. They rocketed away from the slow-starting,
injury-ravaged Bucks, leading by 28-12 at the end of the first quarter.</TE>
<TE>   The Clipper lead would grow to 18 points, the last time at 38-20.
Milwaukee chipped away, mostly on Allen's late second-quarter surge, and
trailed by 42-34 at halftime.</TE>
<TE>   Allen made a three-point basket, scored on a drive to the hoop and
made a jump shot to get the Bucks close in the final minutes of the
second quarter. Thomas' three-pointer got them closer.</TE>
<TE>   Allen, Cassell and Glenn Robinson each sat out Milwaukee's loss
Wednesday against the Minnesota Timberwolves.</TE>
<TE>   Allen, who has tendinitis in his left knee, missed seven games, but
was in the starting lineup Saturday. Cassell, suffering from a sprained
neck, also started. But Robinson was sidelined for his third consecutive
game because of a bruised left though.</TE>
<TE>   Those three are the Bucks' leading scorers.</TE>
<TE>   Against the Clippers, the Bucks needed all the help they could get.
Allen did his best in the first half, keeping them within the same zip
code by scoring 11 points on four-of-12 shooting.</TE>
<TE>   Cassell helped rally Milwaukee in the third quarter, scoring 16 points
on seven-of-eight shooting. Milwaukee still trailed, 64-57, to start the
fourth, but went on an 8-0 run to take the lead.</TE>
<TE>   "We knew they were going to make a run at us," Clipper Coach Alvin
Gentry said. "But this win gives us confidence we can come up with a play
and win. Lamar made the play. He created a shot for Jeff and Jeff made
it.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a great win for us against a quality team from the East."</TE>
<TE>   (BEGIN TEXT OF INFOBOX / INFOGRAPHIC)</TE>
<TE>The Road Awaits</TE>
<TE>   With their win over Milwaukee on Saturday, the Clippers are 16-7 in
home games. Their 2-8 road record isn't as impressive as they embark
Monday on a six-game-in-nine-day road trip. A look:</TE>

<HD>Report: Sooners' Stoops Is Offered Florida Job</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Oklahoma football Coach Bob Stoops reportedly has been offered a
multiyear contract worth more than $3 million a season to succeed Steve
Spurrier as Florida's coach.</LD>
<LD>   Stoops, who has a 31-7 record in three seasons at Oklahoma and guided
the Sooners to the national championship in 2000, was the Gators'
defensive coordinator from 1996-98.</LD>
<LD>   "It is coming very quickly," a source close to the Florida athletic
department told the Orlando Sentinel on Saturday. "There's not going to
be a lot of romance here."</LD>
<TE>   Stoops, who earned $2 million last season, met with Oklahoma Athletic
Director Joe Castiglione on Saturday for two hours. The paper said Stoops
emerged from the meeting non-committal.</TE>
<TE>   Stoops' 2000 salary ranked second among college coaches to Spurrier's
$2.1 deal. When Stoops, 41, was hired by Oklahoma in 1998, his salary was
$625,000, but he was given three raises in his first 18 months on the
job. His current deal reportedly includes a buyout clause for $200,000.</TE>
<TE>   If Stoops accepts Florida's offer, he is expected to name brother
Mark, the secondary coach at Miami, as the Gators' defensive coordinator.
The paper said another brother, Mike, who is Oklahoma's associate head
coach and co-defensive coordinator, would be in line to take over the
Oklahoma post.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Bill Diedrick, Stanford's offensive coordinator the last four years,
is following Tyrone Willingham to Notre Dame.</TE>
<TE>   Diedrick, 55, has been hired by the new Irish coach as his offensive
coordinator, with the mission of overhauling Notre Dame's offense.</TE>
<TE>   Willingham signed a six-year contract Monday.</TE>
<TE>Tennis</TE>
<TE>   Jennifer Capriati won the Hong Kong Ladies Tennis Challenge, tuning up
for her Australian Open title defense with a 1-6, 6-4, 6-4 victory over
Elena Dementieva of Russia.</TE>
<TE>   Dementieva led, 4-3, in the third set.</TE>

<TE>   Top-seeded Tim Henman of Great Britain rallied to defeat Spain's
Alberto Martin, 7-5, 4-6, 6-2, in a semifinal of the Australian Men's
Hardcourt Championships at Adelaide.</TE>
<TE>   Australia's Mark Philippoussis beat Moroccan Hicham Arazi, 6-4, 6-1,
in the other semifinal.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Jan-Michael Gambill double-faulted on match point against Tommy
Robredo, and the United States went on to lose to Spain, 2-1, in the
Hopman Cup final at Perth, Australia.</TE>
<TE>   After winning in singles, Robredo teamed with Arantxa Sanchez-Vicario
to beat Gambill and Monica Seles in mixed doubles, 6-4, 6-2, clinching
the title.</TE>
<TE>   Seles, who won a Hopman Cup for her native Yugoslavia in 1991, gave
the Americans a 1-0 lead by beating Sanchez-Vicario, 6-1, 7-6 (6).</TE>
<TE>   Then Robredo, 19, evened the best-of-three series by defeating
Gambill, 6-3, 2-6, 7-6 (2).</TE>
<TE>   Younes El Aynaoui of Morocco rallied past Felix Mantilla of Spain,
4-6, 6-2, 6-2, to win the $1-million Qatar Open at Doha.</TE>

Slovakia, 4-6, 6-3, 6-3, in the other semifinal.</TE>
<TE>Baseball</TE>
<TE>   Reggie Sanders signed a one-year contract with the San Francisco
Giants, leaving World Series champion Arizona after hitting a career-high
33 home runs last season.</TE>
<TE>   Sanders, 34, batted .263 with 90 runs batted in for the Diamondbacks.
He is expected to play right field for the Giants and solidify the middle
of a lineup that includes single-season home run champion Barry Bonds and
former National League most valuable player Jeff Kent.</TE>
<TE>Boxing</TE>
<TE>   Artur Grigorian of Uzbekistan defended his World Boxing Organization
lightweight title for the 15th time, stopping Mexico's Rocky Martinez in
the eighth round at Magdeburg, Germany.</TE>
<TE>   Grigorian improved to 34-0 with 22 knockouts.</TE>
<TE>   Referee Paul Thomas' decision to end the fight with 45 seconds left in
the eighth drew boos from the crowd because Martinez didn't appear to be
in serious trouble.</TE>
<TE>   Martinez dropped to 36-6-1.</TE>
<TE>Passings</TE>
<TE>   Georg Ericson, the only coach to lead Sweden's national soccer team to
two World Cup finals, died Friday at Aaby, Sweden. He was 82.</TE>
<TE>   Under Ericson, Sweden finished fifth in the 1974 Cup at West Germany
and was eliminated in the preliminary round in 1978 at Argentina.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Rick Morrissey in the Chicago Tribune: "The Rose Bowl was supposed
to be the national championship game of the bowl championship series, but
it was reduced to a game of hide-and-seek.</LD>
<LD>   "The winner was forced to hide behind a sham of a system, and Oregon
was left to seek justice. If there were any, the second-best team in the
Big 12's North Division wouldn't have been anywhere near the
national-title game....</LD>
<LD>   "The two most dominant teams in college football didn't get a chance
to play each other. Miami will always have Thursday night. Oregon will
have its daydreams."</LD>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   More BCS: Bob Ryan in the Boston Globe: "You can imagine some Nebraska
guy turning to his wife early in the second quarter and saying, 'We put
off buying the new tractor for \o7 this\f7 ?\o7 '\f7  ...</TE>
<TE>   "So let's hope those jaunts to Disneyland, Universal Studios and maybe
even Rodeo Drive went well. Good Huskers can't live on football alone."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Even more BCS: From Mike Bianchi in the Orlando Sentinel: "There were
93,781 fans at the Rose Bowl on Thursday, and it seemed like there were
900,000 wearing Nebraska red. If this were a movie, it would have been
called 'The Tomato That Ate Pasadena.'</TE>
<TE>   "Huskers fans didn't just buy their allotment of 21,000 tickets; they
gobbled them down like a threshing machine inhales cornstalks. And they
begged for more and more and more."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Trivia time: How many former UCLA and USC players have played for the
Lakers?</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Hopeless: Freelance columnist Norman Chad analyzing some of this
weekend's NFL games:</TE>
<TE>   * "Vikings at Ravens: Cris Carter helping Randy Moss 'develop into an
NFL player' in Minnesota appears to be as sound a decision as the U.S.
helping Saddam Hussein 'consolidate power' in Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   * "Cowboys at Lions: Emmitt Smith quietly checking if NFL Europe
rushing yardage would count toward his career march past Walter Payton."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Why not? Skip Bayless of the San Jose Mercury News, writing on
Stanford pursuing the San Francisco 49ers' Steve Mariucci for its next
football coach: "Stanford should go after a man who offers even more than
[Tyrone] Willingham did--a highly personable and principled NFL coach
with a college rah-rah approach."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Pro picks: From the Caught on the Fly column in the Sporting News: "It
took about a nanosecond after Oregon and Fresno finished bowling for
QB-desperate teams [start a single-file line behind Li'l Danny Snyder] to
start making eyes at Joey Harrington and David Carr. The early
handicapping says NFL scouts favor Harrington for his size, but Carr gets
the nod for his arm, mobility, poise and, yep, upside."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Looking back: On this day in 1951, Indianapolis defeated Rochester,
73-71, in a game that lasted an NBA-record six overtimes.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Trivia answer: Twelve Bruins and five Trojans.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   And finally: Pitcher David Wells reportedly will join the New York
Yankees. Said Ken Rudulph of Fox's "Best Damn Sports Show Period": "The
deal will be complete following a physical, which has been delayed in
order to assemble enough people to lift Wells onto the scales."</TE>

<LD>Joe Thornton had three goals, and the Boston Bruins remained nearly

<HD>Tough-Guy Brennan Gets the Call</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jerry Crowe</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>UNIONDALE, N.Y.</DL>
<LD>Kip Brennan, a tough-guy winger, was recalled Saturday from the
Kings' American Hockey League team at Manchester, N.H., and made his NHL
debut in Saturday night's game against the New York Islanders.</LD>
<LD>  After Ken Belanger was put on the injured reserve list Friday because
of a broken left thumb, the Kings could have brought back Brad Chartrand,
who was sent down Wednesday after Ziggy Palffy and Mathieu Schneider were
activated, but they opted instead for the 6-foot-4, 222-pound Brennan.</LD>
<LD>  Brennan, the Kings' fourth-round pick in the 1998 NHL draft, had three
points and a team-leading 125 penalty minutes in 23 games with the
Manchester Monarchs.</LD>
<TE>  "It's the type of player we lost," Coach Andy Murray said, explaining
why Brennan got the nod over Chartrand as the roster replacement for the
6-4, 231-pound Belanger. "I think we need to have that [element] in our
lineup."</TE>
<TE>  Brennan, 21, said his parents, brother and sister-in-law made the trip
from Kingston, Canada, to watch his first NHL game.</TE>
<TE>  "I'm sure he's over-excited and I'm sure he's going to be
over-aggressive," Murray said before the game. "He just has to have some
balance there and we just have to tutor him as coaches.</TE>
<TE>  "He's got to play hard and he's got to know that what he does, he has
to do for the team. That's the important thing."</TE>

<HD>Kovalev Takes Care of Rangers</HD>
<DH>Hockey: Forward's hat trick lifts Penguins, 4-1. Lindros returns
for New York, but Fleury leaves after three slashing penalties.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>PITTSBURGH</DL>
<LD>Just when the New York Rangers got Eric Lindros back, Theo Fleury
disappeared. It added up to another eventful day for them--and another
loss to Pittsburgh.</LD>
<LD>   Alexei Kovalev scored three goals, the final two less than a minute
apart in the third period, and the Penguins shrugged off Lindros' return
to beat the Rangers, 4-1, Saturday.</LD>
<LD>   It was Kovalev's third three-goal game this season and included a
go-ahead score at 4:33 of the third, only the 16th goal in 163 chances
for the Penguins' league-worst power play.</LD>
<TE>   Lindros returned after sitting out four games because of the seventh
concussion of his career. He had a mostly uneventful game, going without
a shot in the first period before getting three in a second period in
which Pittsburgh killed two five-on-three advantages by the Rangers.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought he was a little rusty," Ranger Coach Ron Low said.
"Obviously, he hasn't skated since Christmas, and it was a tough night
for their line."</TE>
<TE>   Fleury, Lindros' linemate, left with 7:37 remaining after being called
for his third slashing penalty. He dressed and went to the team bus
before the game ended.</TE>
<TE>   "I think he's a bit frustrated," Ranger goalie Mike Richter said. "He
plays every game as hard as he can and he thrives on his emotions. I
think he blew a gasket there, but he'll be fine. When you play on the
edge like that, it makes you a special player, but sometimes you've got
to reel it in a little."</TE>
<TE>   Kovalev scored 14:15 into the first period and Radek Dvorak tied the
score, 1-1, on a short-handed goal later in the second period.</TE>
<TE>   Kovalev's go-ahead goal was a seemingly harmless wrist shot from the
left point that got by Richter. He made it 3-1 at 5:21 of the third
period.</TE>
<TE>   Wayne Primeau scored his third goal of the season late in the period.</TE>
<TE>   Johan Hedberg made 35 saves for the Penguins.</TE>

<KH>DUCK REPORT</KH>
<HD>Despite Slump, Kariya Keeps His Chin Up</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Lonnie White</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>For a player riding a six-game scoreless streak, which ties the
longest drought of his career, Mighty Duck captain Paul Kariya didn't
seem concerned about it after Saturday's practice.</LD>
<LD>  "I've played horrible games and [scored] two or three goals," Kariya
said. "I would have done nothing but got the puck on my stick twice and
it went in. I've also played great games and got nothing. I'm not saying
that I'm playing great right now, but I'm not playing as badly as the
stats."</LD>
<LD>  In 44 games, Kariya has 13 goals and 16 assists, but he hasn't gotten a
point since Dec. 23. With only 29 points and 38 games remaining, Kariya,
in his eighth season, is on pace to finish with his lowest point total in
a noninjury season.</LD>
<TE>  Anaheim Coach Bryan Murray said that it hasn't helped that Kariya is
playing on a line with Andy McDonald and Marty McInnis instead of Steve
Rucchin and Teemu Selanne.</TE>
<TE>  "I don't think his play has dropped, his effort has been good every
night," Murray said. "Having two guys missing off, which historically has
been his line, is a factor."</TE>
<TE>  Kariya, however, disagreed with his coach.</TE>
<TE>  "If I wasn't getting chances, that may be the problem. But chances are
there every game," Kariya said.</TE>
<TE>  *</TE>
<TE>  One of the top players at the World Junior Championships at the Czech
Republic was Anaheim prospect Stanislav Chistov, who helped lead Russia
to a gold medal with a 5-4 victory against Canada in the final. Chistov
was selected the championship game most valuable player and finished the
tournament with four goals and eights assists.</TE>
<TE>  *</TE>
<TE>  Vitaly Vishnevski, who has missed five games because of a sprained left
ankle, practiced Saturday and Murray hopes to play the defenseman when
the Ducks host St. Louis on Wednesday.</TE>

<HD>Potvin Is All Kings Need</HD>
<DH>Hockey: Goalie stops 28 Islander shots and L.A. finally breaks
through in third period for 3-0 win. L.A. now at .500.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JERRY CROWE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>UNIONDALE, N.Y.</DL>
<LD>The Kings picked an opportune time to post their first shutout,
opening a five-game trip Saturday night with a 3-0 victory against the
New York Islanders in front of a sellout crowd of 16,234 at Nassau
Coliseum.</LD>
<LD>   The Kings climbed to .500 at 16-16-7-2 as they reached the halfway
point in their season, but before Felix Potvin stopped 28 shots to
prevent the Islanders from scoring, they were the only team in the NHL
without a shutout.</LD>
<LD>   Locked in an often spectacular duel with Islander goaltender Chris
Osgood for nearly 21/2 periods, Potvin was the beneficiary of two
third-period goals by Eric Belanger and one by Bryan Smolinski in his
first regular-season shutout since March 31, when he blanked the Colorado
Avalanche, 4-0.</LD>
<TE>   Potvin was especially brilliant in the first period, when the Kings
showed the energy-sapping effects of flying across the country on Friday
and then busing through the Long Island rush hour from the Newark, N.J.,
airport.</TE>
<TE>   "Unbelievable," Belanger said of Potvin, who made half his saves in
the first 20 minutes. "He kept us in the game in the first period.</TE>
<TE>   "Without him, I don't think we would have won the game."</TE>
<TE>   Outshot in the first period, 14-7, the Kings bounced back strong in
the second to outshoot the Islanders, 11-2, but all they had to show for
it was a scoreless tie as Osgood matched Potvin almost save for save.</TE>
<TE>   About 41/2 minutes into the third period, during a King power play,
Osgood made another spectacular save on a point-blank shot by Ziggy
Palffy.</TE>
<TE>   "Miraculous," an impressed King Coach Andy Murray called it.</TE>
<TE>   The Kings, however, kept the pressure on. They finally scored with
11:57 to play after defenseman Mattias Norstrom, momentarily assuming the
role of a winger as he emerged from the penalty box, picked up the puck
in the King zone, carried it across the neutral zone and fed a pass to
Belanger in the right circle.</TE>
<TE>   With Norstrom and Ian Laperriere taking the defenders with them as
they charged the net, Belanger carried the puck back across the slot and
whistled a shot from the left faceoff circle that caught Osgood leaning
the wrong way.</TE>
<TE>   It caught the inside of the right post and caromed into the net.</TE>
<TE>   "I kept the puck and was patient with it and everything opened up in
front of me," Belanger said. "I'd had so many chances earlier in the game
that I said, 'I've got to put this one in.' I just wanted to throw it at
the net.</TE>
<TE>   "I tried, like, three shots off the glove [earlier] and he robbed me a
couple times. This one, I kept it lower, so I was happy with that shot."</TE>
<TE>   So were the Kings, who finally had some breathing room.</TE>
<TE>   Smolinski gave them a little more when he scored a power-play goal on
a shot from the left point with 7:23 to play, making the score 2-0.</TE>
<TE>   Belanger and Smolinski then combined on a short-handed empty-net goal
with 2:03 remaining, Belanger starting a two-on-one rush when he picked
up the puck after the Islanders' Shawn Bates fanned on a shot from the
right point.</TE>
<TE>   Belanger fed it ahead to Smolinski, who gave it back to him for a shot
from the right circle that gave Belanger his eighth goal.</TE>
<TE>   "There were so many good things in that game for us," said Murray,
whose team reached the halfway point last season with a 17-16-7-1 record.
"We scored a power-play goal when we needed it. We scored a short-handed
goal." And, of course, they got a great performance from Potvin.</TE>
<TE>   "Our goalie gave us a chance in the first period to get our legs,"
Murray said. "We were kind of flat, which I would attribute to the trip
because we showed what we could do once we got our legs under us.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought we played very good over the last 40 minutes."</TE>
<TE>   Potvin gave it a full 60 in posting his sixth shutout in 56 starts for
the Kings since the trade last February that brought him from Vancouver.</TE>
<TE>   It mattered little to him that he'd gone so long between shutouts.</TE>
<TE>   "I've never been a guy that's had a lot of shutouts," he said. "I only
have 20 out of 550 [actually 527] games. I don't really worry about
shutouts. I think shutouts don't mean anything unless it's a 1-0 game. It
was just fun to win.</TE>
<TE>   "That's our main goal: to win."</TE>

<LD>Finally, after 16 long weeks of waiting for cream to rise to the
top, and then watching it freeze in Cincinnati and Minnesota, the field
for the 2001 NFL most-valuable-player award has been narrowed to eight.
How the tournament plays out from here:</LD>
<TE>QUARTERFINALS</TE>
<TE>   * Kurt Warner (St. Louis) vs. Kordell Stewart (Pittsburgh).</TE>
<TE>   On the marquee: Starting quarterbacks for the winningest teams in each
conference.</TE>
<TE>   On the field: Stewart is here because someone from the Steelers has
to--and he did manage to keep things together while Jerome Bettis was
sidelined for a month. No need to bore you with the statistical mismatch,
except for this: Warner has thrown for more than twice as many
touchdowns, 33-14.</TE>
<TE>   Turning point: Stewart drafted ahead of Warner in zero fantasy
leagues.</TE>
<TE>   Winner: Warner.</TE>
<TE>   * Brett Favre (Green Bay) vs. Rich Gannon (Oakland).</TE>
<TE>   On the marquee: Best 30-something quarterbacks in the game.</TE>
<TE>   On the field: Total passing yards a virtual dead heat--3,606 for
Favre, 3,604 for Gannon. Favre has thrown for four more touchdowns
(30-26) and won one more game (11-10).</TE>
<TE>   Turning point: Down the stretch, when it matters most, Gannon's
Raiders have lost two in a row and three of their last five.</TE>
<TE>   Winner: Favre.</TE>
<TE>   * Michael Strahan (New York Giants) vs. Brian Urlacher (Chicago).</TE>
<TE>   On the marquee: Defensive players of the year.</TE>
<TE>   On the field: Strahan needs half a sack to tie Mark Gastineau's
single-season record of 22. Urlacher did everything, including catching
game-winning touchdown passes, for a Bear team that still could finish as
the NFC's No. 1 seeded team.</TE>
<TE>   Turning point: The name of the award is "most valuable" and Urlacher
is the best player on the most unlikely 12-game winner in memory. The
Giants would have missed the playoffs with or without Strahan.</TE>
<TE>   Winner: Urlacher.</TE>
<TE>   * Marshall Faulk (St. Louis) vs. Curtis Martin (New York Jets).</TE>
<TE>   On the marquee: All-purpose all-stars.</TE>
<TE>   On the field: Faulk is the reigning champion, last season's MVP, with
winning-type numbers again: 1,214 rushing yards, 78 receptions and 20
touchdowns. Martin, with 1,455 rushing yards and 10 touchdowns, has
dragged the Jets kicking and screaming to 9-6.</TE>
<TE>   Turning point: If the Jets lose to the Raiders today, which is
probable, and the Seahawks defeat the Chiefs, which is probable, Martin
will miss the playoffs.</TE>
<TE>   Winner: Faulk.</TE>
<TE>SEMIFINALS</TE>
<TE>   * Warner vs. Favre</TE>
<TE>   On the marquee: Top guns.</TE>
<TE>   On the field: Neither of their teams would be anywhere near the
playoffs without them. Favre is the first quarterback to pass for more
than 3,000 yards in 10 consecutive seasons; Warner is at 4,550 and
counting, with a 67.8 completion percentage and the highest quarterback
rating (101.3) in the league.</TE>
<TE>   Turning point: Favre followed up two victories over the Bears with
losses to Atlanta and Tennessee, probably costing the Packers the NFC
Central title.</TE>
<TE>   Winner: Warner.</TE>
<TE>   * Urlacher vs. Faulk</TE>
<TE>   On the marquee: NFC championship game preview.</TE>
<TE>   On the field: In his second season, Urlacher is already drawing
comparisons to Dick Butkus and Mike Singletary. With 79 yards today
against Atlanta, Faulk will become the first player to amass 2,000
rushing/receiving yards in four consecutive seasons.</TE>
<TE>   Turning point: Moot. Defensive players never win this award.</TE>
<TE>   Winner: Faulk.</TE>
<TE>FINAL</TE>
<TE>   * Warner vs. Faulk</TE>
<TE>   On the marquee: Intrasquad scrimmage.</TE>
<TE>   On the field: Whom would the Rams most miss? Without Faulk, who sat
out two games because of a knee injury, the Rams went 1-1, losing at home
to New Orleans, then routing the Jets as Faulk's replacement, Trung
Canidate, rushed for 195 yards and two touchdowns.</TE>
<TE>   Without Warner, the Rams would start Jamie Martin.</TE>
<TE>   Turning point: Faulk won this award last year even though Donovan
McNabb was more deserving. He has his. And, I repeat: Jamie Martin?</TE>
<TE>   Winner: Warner. And this would be good for the game. An MVP award
usually means a salary bump, which means Warner won't need to film any
more Chunky Soup ads. He wins, we win.</TE>
<TE>Top 10 Names the Pro Bowl Forgot</TE>
<TE>   Just like computers, humans are fallible too ...</TE>
<TE>   1. Mike Brown, Chicago: Two mind-blowing, season-saving,
league-altering overtime interception returns in back-to-back games ought
to be worth something.</TE>
<TE>   2. Troy Brown, New England: Tom Brady made the AFC roster, much to the
consternation of Tennessee Titan fans grousing about Steve McNair's
career season going ignored. I have no problem with Brady on the squad,
but somebody had to be catching all those passes. In 15 games, Brown had
95 of them.</TE>
<TE>   3. Hines Ward, Pittsburgh: The single-season pass-reception leader in
the history of the Pittsburgh Steelers. Think about that for a moment.</TE>
<TE>   4. Phillip Daniels, Chicago: Lost out to Robert Porcher, who plays
defensive end for the Detroit Lions. Think about that for a moment.</TE>
<TE>   5. Torry Holt, St. Louis: More receptions, yards and touchdowns than
teammate Isaac Bruce, who made the cut.</TE>
<TE>   6. Takeo Spikes, Cincinnati: He blames his snub on his being a Bengal.
What can you say? He's absolutely right.</TE>
<TE>   7. Leonard Davis, Arizona: Massive interior lineman might be the NFL's
offensive rookie of the year. But, he plays for the Cardinals, and they
already had David Boston on the NFC squad.</TE>
<TE>   8. Tony Richardson, Kansas City: Lost out to Buffalo's Larry Centers,
who broke the record for all-time receptions by a running back, and
voters figured that deserved a lifetime achievement award.</TE>
<TE>   9. Fred Beasley, San Francisco: Should have been the NFC fullback, but
that spot went to Tampa Bay's Mike Alstott, who actually plays tailback
for the Buccaneers and wound up the fourth-leading vote-getter among
fans. Yeah, top four players in football: Favre, Warner, Faulk and
Alstott. Sounds about right.</TE>
<TE>   10. Mike Barrow, New York Giants: The Giants deserved a linebacker on
the NFC roster, just not Jessie Armstead and his 11/2 sacks.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Denver at Indianapolis, 10 a.m. Jim Mora read the news the other
day, oh boy: Veteran coach, having the run of a vastly talented offense
that plays in a dome, fails year after year to reach the Super Bowl and
at 5-10 with one game to go is forced to resign. Uh-oh. Dennis Green is
only the first domino to fall, Mora knows, and this, at last, could be
the end of the line. Asked by the Indianapolis Star what he thought about
his coach's predicament, Colt defensive end Ellis Johnson said, "Mr.
Irsay don't pay us for thinking around here. He pays us to win football
games." Yeah, go tell that to Mora.</LD>
<LD>   The line: Indianapolis by 2.</LD>
<LD>   UNLESS, OF COURSE, YOU'RE COUNTING TODAY'S GAME</LD>
<TE>   Dallas at Detroit, 10 a.m. Did you hear the one about the Lions being
the best team in the NFC? Here goes: The Lions beat the Vikings, who beat
the Packers, who beat the Bears (twice) and the Bears beat the Buccaneers
(twice) and the Buccaneers beat the Rams, who have the conference's best
record at 13-2. And that, we swear, is absolutely the last Detroit Lions
joke of the season.</TE>
<TE>   The line: Dallas by 3.</TE>
<TE>   THE FUTURE WAS THEN</TE>
<TE>   Arizona at Washington, 10 a.m. "I don't see me being, like, the future
here," Redskin receiver Michael Westbrook told the Washington Post this
week. "If I had to look into a crystal ball--I can't tell the future--but
I don't see me being here." Neither do the Redskins, who wish they had
that crystal ball back in 1995, before they burned the fourth draft pick
on Westbrook.</TE>
<TE>   The line: Washington by 31/2.</TE>
<TE>   EASIER SAID THAN DONE</TE>
<TE>   Green Bay at New York Giants, 10 a.m. In two of his last three games,
Ahman Green has netted 11 and 31 rushing yards, suggesting the Packer
back is either running on fumes or opposing defenses are stacking against
the run. Green Bay Coach Mike Sherman argues the latter: "If you want to
stop the run, you can stop the run." Unless, apparently, you play for
Green Bay, which has yielded consecutive 100-yard rushing performances to
Jamel White, Skip Hicks and Michael Bennett.</TE>
<TE>   The line: Green Bay by 3.</TE>
<TE>   ANOTHER WAY TO KEEP WARM: BURNING BRIDGES</TE>
<TE>   Jacksonville at Chicago, 10 a.m., Channel 2. Jaguar kicker Mike Hollis
missed a 42-yard field-goal attempt in last week's loss to the Chiefs,
and didn't much like hearing his coach, Tom Coughlin, grouse to the media
about it. So Hollis, a free agent to be, gathered some reporters around
to say, "I've never told you guys my take on this organization and Tom
Coughlin himself. ... It's hard to come here and enjoy your job when
you're getting fined for wearing your overcoat too long or foolish
things." But on your way out the door, your coat can be however long you
want.</TE>
<TE>   The line: Chicago by 51/2.</TE>
<TE>   STILL NOT ON A FIRST-NAME BASIS</TE>
<TE>   Cleveland at Pittsburgh, 10 a.m. Behind the blocking-sled jaw and the
crazed eyeballs, Steeler Coach Bill Cowher is a sensitive artiste, with
feelings that are easily bruised when a colleague, such as Cleveland's
Butch Davis, refuses to use his first name when discussing Cowher with
reporters. "We'll find out Sunday what Cowher's going to do," Davis told
the Akron Beacon Journal, which Cowher interpreted as a lack of respect.
Cowher: "You can tell Davis up there if he wants to worry about what
we're doing down here, he'd be best just to worry about his own football
team up there." No word yet if that offended Davis. But he's a grown man
other grownups call Butch, so probably not.</TE>
<TE>   The line: Pittsburgh by 7.</TE>
<TE>   A TEAM HEADING SOUTH, IN MORE WAYS THAN ONE</TE>
<TE>   San Francisco at New Orleans, 10 a.m., Channel 11. The Saints play the
49ers today for the last time as NFC West rivals before moving to the new
NFC South next season. "It's the end of an era," Saint safety Sammy
Knight, getting a little melodramatic, told reporters this week. "It's
going to be weird. ... I'll miss playing the Steve Youngs, Terrell Owens,
the Jeff Garcias. It was a great opportunity. I learned a lot [about]
football by playing those guys." So did the all the Saints, who mastered
the technique of getting off the field after a 49er game before the New
Orleans fans could successfully pelt most of them.</TE>
<TE>   The line: San Francisco by 21/2.</TE>
<TE>   EXCEPT THE PANTHERS PUNTED A LOT AND RETURNED A LOT OF KICKOFFS</TE>
<TE>   New England at Carolina, 10 a.m. The Panthers are 1-14 and with a
likely defeat today will become the first team in league history to lose
15 consecutive games in a season. Yet the Panthers wound up with three
players in the Pro Bowl--tight end Wesley Walls, kick returner Steve
Smith and punter Todd Sauerbrun. Asked for a reaction, Sauerbrun reacted
the only way possible. "It doesn't make any sense," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The line: New England by 61/2.</TE>
<TE>   HE SHOULD REQUEST A TRADE TO CAROLINA</TE>
<TE>   Cincinnati at Tennessee, 10 a.m. Meanwhile, in Cincinnati, linebacker
Takeo Spikes was left off the AFC Pro Bowl roster, and left groping for
reasons why. "I'm sure that some people look at it as we're the Bengals,"
Spikes said, "but mostly it's just the wins and losses. That will never
change. I hate it." But it's January in Cincinnati and the Bengals are
5-10, so what can you do? "Life goes on," Spikes said, which is one way
to put it.</TE>
<TE>   The line: Tennessee by 51/2.</TE>
<TE>   ALWAYS LOOK ON THE BRIGHT SIDE OF LIFE</TE>
<TE>   Atlanta at St. Louis, 1 p.m. Meanwhile, in St. Louis, the 13-2 Rams
received only five spots on the NFC Pro Bowl roster and linebacker London
Fletcher, who wasn't one of them, was predictably displeased. "It's
obvious people around the league just don't like the Rams," he said.
"They feel they can snub us with Pro Bowl selections. But, hey, we're
still going to win the Super Bowl."</TE>
<TE>   The line: St. Louis by 141/2.</TE>
<TE>   IN OTHER WORDS: PLEASE WRITE WHEN YOU FIND WORK</TE>
<TE>   Buffalo at Miami, 1:15 p.m. Rob Johnson couldn't beat out Mark Brunell
in Jacksonville, kind of beat out Doug Flutie in Buffalo and now appears
to ready to be run out of town by Alex Van Pelt. "We hope he's found a
permanent home here in Buffalo," Bill General Manager Tom Donahoe said of
Van Pelt, 2-2 in his last four starts. "And we're going to do whatever we
can to try to keep him here." As for Johnson? "Obviously, for Rob to come
back here, a couple things have to happen," Donahoe said. "A: He has to
want to be here. And B: Something has to be done with his contract to
make it feasible for him to be here."</TE>
<TE>   The line: Miami by 61/2.</TE>
<TE>   UNLESS, OF COURSE, HOLMGREN DECIDES TO BENCH HIM AGAIN</TE>
<TE>   Kansas City at Seattle, 1:15 p.m. Mike Holmgren is in denial, Brian
Billick is in denial, everyone who ever coached Trent Dilfer in the NFL
is in denial, so John Elway decided to post this bit on the NFL's Web
site: "Ravens head coach Brian Billick might not want to admit this, but
he probably wishes he had Dilfer back at quarterback this year." Unlike
Elvis Grbac or Matt Hasselbeck, Dilfer is undefeated in his last 14
starts, and if he wins again today, and the Ravens lose Monday, Billick
will be at home watching Dilfer in the playoffs.</TE>
<TE>   The line: Seattle by 31/2.</TE>
<TE>   WHY DIDN'T THEY THINK OF THIS IN CAROLINA?</TE>
<TE>   Philadelphia at Tampa Bay, 5:30 p.m. The first half of this
home-and-home doubleheader is meaningless, with both teams having
clinched playoff berths and a first-round encounter next week in
Philadelphia. Eagle safety Damon Moore suggests that "Maybe they ought to
just refund the money to all those people who have tickets and let both
[teams] take the weekend off, huh?" Because, with or without fans at
Raymond James Stadium, that's precisely what the Eagles and the
Buccaneers are going to do, anyway.</TE>
<TE>   The line: Tampa Bay by 3.</TE>
<TE>   CAN'T BLAME ANY OF THEM, REALLY</TE>
<TE>   Minnesota at Baltimore, Monday, 6 p.m., Channel 7. Viking Coach Green
has agreed to let the team buy out the remaining two years of his
contract. Raven defensive lineman Tony Siragusa has announced his
retirement. Viking wide receiver Cris Carter has announced his intentions
to play elsewhere next season, possibly in Baltimore. If there's anyone,
anywhere, who still wants to play this game, will he please turn out the
lights?</TE>
<TE>   The line: Baltimore by 10.</TE>

<KH>GAME OF THE WEEK</KH>
<HD>New York Jets at Oakland, 1:15 p.m., Channel 2</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE PENNER</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>ALL IN ALL, THEY'RE JUST TWO TEAMS THAT HAVE HIT THE WALL</LD>
<LD>  It's always a special occasion when the Heidi Bowl contestants gather
again in Oakland--couldn't these Jets use Namath-to-Maynard now?--and
today's reunion is no different.</LD>
<LD>   The Jets are bickering because they couldn't manage a clock to save
their season, running out of time and brain cells in last week's 14-9
loss to Buffalo, and are on the verge of tumbling out of the playoffs
altogether. The Raiders are bickering because they've lost two in a row,
are 2-3 in their last five, and are on the verge of fumbling the No. 2
seeding and first-round bye to New England.</LD>
<TE>   The problem, Raider quarterback Rich Gannon believes, is discipline.</TE>
<TE>   "I think we need to be more disciplined," he said this week. "I'll get
scolded for saying it, [but] we need to be a more disciplined football
team."</TE>
<TE>   Gannon's right, you know. He did get scolded for saying it.</TE>
<TE>   "That's not what we need to be talking about," teammate Tim Brown shot
back. "We need to be talking turnovers. [Gannon had three last Sunday.]
If Rich can't control that, then that's [Coach Jon] Gruden's job. If
Gruden isn't talking about [discipline], he doesn't need to be talking
about it."</TE>
<TE>   The same goes for either of these teams playing in the Super Bowl,
needless to say.</TE>
<TE>   The line: Oakland by 31/2.</TE>

<HD>Perry Survives Wind</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>KAPALUA, Hawaii</DL>
<LD>Kenny Perry wants to play well and have fun on the PGA Tour. He
accomplished one of those goals Saturday in the Mercedes Championships,
the season-opening tournament that feels more like a tuneup for the
British Open.</LD>
<LD>   Perry shared the 54-hole lead on the Plantation Course at Kapalua,
limiting his mistakes to a three-putt bogey for a two-under 71 that left
him tied with Scott Verplank.</LD>
<LD>   That didn't make it a walk on the beach.</LD>
<TE>   "There was not much fun out there today," Perry said. "It was survival
on every golf shot. A lot of pressure."</TE>
<TE>   Verplank, who plays in the wind in Oklahoma, overcame a bogey-bogey
start for a 70, making a 15-foot eagle on the final hole for a 70 that
allowed him to join Perry at 206.</TE>
<TE>   "Yeah, you grow up in it [wind], but you usually sit inside," Verplank
said.</TE>
<TE>   It was so windy that tour officials moved up the tee box on four holes
on the back nine. It was so windy that Perry kept his putter off the
ground in case his ball moved.</TE>
<TE>   It did for Chris DiMarco, who had a 68 and was one stroke back.</TE>
<TE>   He had an eight-foot par putt on No. 5 that stopped a foot from the
hole.</TE>
<TE>   He was getting ready to tap-in when a gust carried his ball seven feet
past the hole and he made double bogey.</TE>
<TE>   "Two or three times out there, I had a one-foot putt, probably took me
three or four minutes to hit, not let the wind blow me over," he said.
"It was really hard."</TE>
<TE>   Also at 207 was PGA champion David Toms, who had a 72.</TE>
<TE>   "This is no fun," said Mark Calcavecchia, three strokes back after a
71. He holed out from the fourth fairway for eagle and closed with four
straight birdies.</TE>
<TE>   "It's about a 20 on the Stimpmeter on some holes," he said. "You get
the ball going and you can't stop it. A little wind is not bad, like 25
mph. But not 40. This is brutal."</TE>
<TE>   Sergio Garcia also had a 68 and was at 210, along with David Duval
(72).</TE>
<TE>   "If I would have shot five under on Thursday, I would feel like it was
one or two over," the 21-year-old Spaniard said. "Today I shot five under
and I feel like I shot nine [under]. It's playing quite different.</TE>
<TE>   Tiger Woods finished with another 74 and was 10 strokes behind.</TE>

<HD>Threats Made to Event in New Zealand</HD>

<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WELLINGTON, New Zealand</DL>
<LD>Days before Tiger Woods' first appearance in New Zealand, police
and U.S. Embassy officials said today that the embassy received a letter
containing cyanide and threats to disrupt the New Zealand Open.</LD>
<LD>  Assistant Police Commissioner Jon White said the threats were directed
at the tournament, rather than Woods individually, but "it was clear the
threats had been made because Woods, the world's No. 1 golfer, was
playing."</LD>
<LD>  White said a "small" amount of cyanide was in the letter mailed in New
Zealand and received by the embassy in Wellington in December. Cyanide,
which comes in paste or powder form, is a deadly poison used to kill
animals and extract gold from ore in mining.</LD>

<LD>USC (8-6, 4-1) at Washington (8-5, 3-1), 7--The Trojans, winners of
five of their last six games, including an 87-66 victory over Washington
State on Friday, are off to their best start in the Pac-10 since 1997.
Coach Chris Gobrecht, in her fifth season at USC, was Washington's coach
from 1988-96, winning a school-record 243 games against 89 defeats.
Washington holds a 17-13 lead in the all-time series between the schools.</LD>

<LD>  UCLA (4-9, 1-4) at Washington State (2-12, 0-4), 2--Despite senior
center Shalada Allen's career-high 16 points, the Bruins couldn't
overcome hot-shooting Washington on Friday, losing, 86-53. Today they
face the Cougars, who are mired in a nine-game losing streak and still
looking for their first conference victory. Cougar freshman Francine
McCurtain scored a season-high 23 points, in the loss to USC.</LD>

<LD>Southern Mississippi forward Elvin Mims, the Golden Eagles' leading
scorer, was suspended indefinitely from the team Saturday.</LD>
<LD>  Southern Miss Coach James Green announced the punishment before the
Golden Eagles' Conference USA opener against Memphis. Green didn't say
why Mims was suspended.</LD>
<LD>  Mims is averaging 18.1 points for the Golden Eagles (5-5), who have
only one other player averaging double figures.</LD>
<TE>  "We obviously will miss Elvin," Green said. "But our rules apply to
everyone, and our players all know that. At this point, I'm not sure what
Elvin's situation is. Whether or not he returns, and when, depends on
Elvin."</TE>

<TE>  Missouri center Uche Okafor's appeal of his suspension for signing with
a Russian semipro team will be heard by an NCAA reinstatement committee
Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>  "I'm never optimistic," Missouri Coach Quin Snyder said. "People are
calling down to try to figure out how long he's been hurt and that tells
me they're after him. That's bothersome to me."</TE>
<TE>  The 6-foot-11 Okafor has been recuperating from October knee surgery.</TE>

<LD>The day started with four and ended with one, proving again how
difficult it is to go undefeated in a college basketball season.</LD>
<LD>   One by one Saturday they fell. First it was No. 4 Virginia in an 81-74
loss to North Carolina State. No. 5 Oklahoma State followed with a 70-61
loss to Texas and No. 21 Miami obliged in a 76-75 loss to Connecticut.</LD>
<LD>   That leaves No. 1 Duke (12-0) as the nation's lone Division I unbeaten
team and the only chance this season to duplicate the 1975-76 Indiana
team, which finished 32-0 and was the last team to complete a perfect
season.</LD>
<TE>   There have been plenty of contenders since then. The closest have been
the 1978-79 Larry Bird-led Indiana State (33-1) team, which lost to Magic
Johnson and Michigan State in the championship, and the 1991 Nevada Las
Vegas (34-1) team, which lost to Duke in the championship.</TE>
<TE>   UNLV also made a run in 1986-87, finishing 37-2 and losing its first
game Jan. 17, 1987, at Oklahoma, 89-88.</TE>
<TE>   The 1990s brought several challenges from two-loss teams, including
Massachusetts, which was 26-0 before losing Feb. 24, 1996, to George
Washington and finishing the season 35-2.</TE>
<TE>   The 1996-97 Kansas team was 22-0 before a 96-94 loss at Missouri on
Feb. 4, 1997. The Jayhawks (34-2) ended on a disappointing note with a
Sweet 16 loss to Arizona.</TE>
<TE>   The 1991-92 Duke team (34-2) and the 1998-99 Connecticut team (34-2)
took undefeated seasons into February, but both ended up with
championships.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Unlikely hero: It had been nearly seven years since Mississippi State
defeated a top-10 opponent at home, but with time winding down and
trailing by three against No. 6 Kentucky it didn't appear the Bulldogs
put the ball in the right player's hands.</TE>
<TE>   Mario Austin, a 6-foot-9 sophomore center who hadn't made either of
the two three-point attempts he had tried in his career, stood as
Mississippi State's hope with seven seconds left in regulation.</TE>
<TE>   With little alternative, Austin launched and made a three-pointer from
the top of the key to tie it and then made five free throws in overtime
to seal the Bulldogs' 74-69 victory at Starkville.</TE>
<TE>   Even Austin admitted he was the last player his team wanted shooting
its game-tying shot.</TE>
<TE>   "It was luck," he said. "I didn't have much time to think about it."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Vertical limit: Georgia football player Fred Gibson, who joined the
basketball team Wednesday after the Bulldogs' loss in the Music City
Bowl, entered the 82-69 victory against Vanderbilt with 2:39 left to the
chant of "We want Fred" from the fans. He made three free throws and had
five points.</TE>
<TE>   Gibson doesn't have his basketball legs yet, though. On a breakaway
after his steal in the final minute, he was forced to lay it in after not
jumping high enough for the dunk.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Merely mortal: Dajuan Wagner isn't the typical freshman and he proved
that by leading Memphis in scoring in 12 of its first 14 games, including
32 against Old Dominion.</TE>
<TE>   But like most young superstars, Wagner finally showed he's mortal by
enduring his first single-digit scoring game of his career, getting nine
points in Memphis' 75-53 victory against Southern Mississippi.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Performance of the day: Henry Domercant scored 38 points, 19 in each
half, as Eastern Illinois rallied from an 18-point deficit in the final
9:19 to beat Southeast Missouri, 84-74.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Performance of the weak: La Salle's Rasual Butler, the nation's second
leading scorer at 24.7 points a game, had only four in a 77-57 loss at
Richmond.</TE>
<TE>   (BEGIN TEXT OF INFOBOX / INFOGRAPHIC)</TE>
<TE>Home Cooking</TE>
<TE>   No. 11 Boston College had the nation's fifth-longest current
home-court win streak end at 25 games Saturday in a 77-74 loss to
Pittsburgh. The Eagles' previous home loss also came against Pittsburgh,
on Feb. 23, 2000. The longest current Division I home win streaks:</TE>

<LD>Texas survived a tussle in the stands to once again get the better
of Oklahoma State.</LD>
<LD>   The Longhorns defeated No. 5 and previously unbeaten Oklahoma State
for the fifth consecutive time, 70-61, Saturday in a Big 12 Conference
game at Stillwater, Okla. marred by a fight with a fan in the closing
seconds.</LD>
<LD>   The trouble started with 18.1 seconds left and Texas leading 70-60.
The Longhorns' Royal Ivey and T.J. Ford wound up out of bounds while
chasing a loose ball, and Ford collided with a pregnant fan. Ford then
was grabbed near the throat by a man identified by Oklahoma State
officials as the woman's husband.</LD>
<TE>   Ivey grabbed the man and tried to pull him away from Ford. Meanwhile,
teammate James Thomas ran in and threw some overhand punches and Brandon
Mouton made his way into the melee.No players were ejected, but Texas,
9-4 overall and 1-0 in the Big 12, was assessed a technical foul because
Fredie Williams left the bench.</TE>
<TE>   "I think things did get out of hand," Mouton said. "I don't think that
fans should put their hands on players. I think we were all just trying
to protect each other and keep things safe."</TE>
<TE>   The spectator took his wife to the hospital as a precaution, Oklahoma
State sports information director Steve Buzzard said.</TE>
<TE>   "What the refs told me was, they looked at the tape and definitely
T.J. had been put in a headlock by an Oklahoma State student, but they
assessed the technical foul because Fredie Williams left the bench, which
he can't do," Texas Coach Rick Barnes said. "I think when that happened,
James and the players went over there and obviously were trying to get
him out of there."</TE>
<TE>   Oklahoma State Coach Eddie Sutton said it was an unfortunate end to a
good game. "That's disappointing," he said. "Our fans, I don't care, have
got to be better behaved than that."</TE>
<TE>   Oklahoma State (13-1, 0-1) shot 33%.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>

<HD>Irvine Goes Inside, Out to Beat Riverside</HD>

<AU>Mike Bresnahan</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>So \o7 this\f7  is what a blowout feels like at UC Irvine.</LD>
<LD>  Never a team to coast to victory--it's always more fun to spot the
opponent seven or eight points and then battle back--the Anteaters did it
the easy way Saturday, drubbing UC Riverside, 72-53, in a Big West
Conference game before 3,299 at the Bren Events Center.</LD>
<LD>  No heroic comebacks. No off-balance game-winners. No nonsense.</LD>
<TE>  The Anteaters, whose average margin of victory had been 3.3 points,
clicked inside, center Adam Parada matching his career-high with 20
points. They made it happen outside, guard Jerry Green scoring 18 points
and forward Jordan Harris making three of five three-pointers on the way
to 15 points.</TE>
<TE>  And an added bonus as well: With UC Santa Barbara losing at home to
Utah State, the Anteaters (10-4, 3-0 Big West Conference) snared sole
possession of first place in the Big West standings.</TE>
<TE>  "We played our best game of the year," Irvine Coach Pat Douglass said.</TE>
<TE>  With the victory, the Anteaters extended their school-record home
winning streak to 18 games. It used to be a big deal for Irvine to win
one in a row, but expectations have risen since the Anteaters won the Big
West last season.</TE>
<TE>  "Until somebody beats them a couple times, they're still the champion,"
Riverside Coach John Masi said. "They're playing like it because Jerry
Green wants to play that way. He doesn't want to lose."</TE>
<TE>  Green handed out seven assists, his second highest total of the season,
but Parada was just as valuable, scoring 10 consecutive points on
tip-ins, jumpers and a spinning backdoor dunk during a four-minute span
of the second half.</TE>
<TE>  Irvine led at halftime, 31-24, but started the second half with a 22-11
run that practically put the game away with 13 minutes left.</TE>
<TE>  "I don't think we've done that since I've been here," said Parada, a
7-foot sophomore who has already seen a career's worth of last-minute
theatrics.</TE>
<TE>  "Those are always exciting, but it's nice to show everyone else in the
league we can win by more than three, four or five points."</TE>
<TE>  Riverside (5-7, 2-2) had been faring pretty well in its first season as
a member of the Big West and stunned Long Beach State, 73-67, on
Thursday, overcoming an 11-point deficit in the second half at The
Pyramid.</TE>
<TE>  But the Highlanders struggled against Irvine's zone, making only 20 of
55 shots (36.4%), including four of 16 from three-point range.</TE>
<TE>  Still, Riverside was within striking distance until Irvine's
second-half spurt.</TE>

<KH>UCLA REPORT</KH>
<HD>Kapono's Production Has Become Half-Good</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE HENSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Nobody's complaining, but Jason Kapono is a vastly different player
in the first half of games than he is in the second.</LD>
<LD>   Nobody's worried, but Kapono, who might be the nation's best shooter,
is in a two-game scoring slump.</LD>
<LD>   Nobody's concerned as long as UCLA is winning and the junior is
plugging more holes than a golf course groundskeeper, moving from point
guard to small forward to shooting guard, then back to the point.</LD>
<TE>   Kapono is averaging only 4.5 points in first halves of the last eight
games, all of which he started at point guard because of Cedric Bozeman's
knee injury. He isn't ineffective, though, busying himself by
distributing the ball and establishing an offensive flow.</TE>
<TE>   It all changes in the second half, when he is averaging 13.6 points
over the eight games. Several times he has made key shots in the late
moments to preserve leads.</TE>
<TE>   For the season, Kapono is averaging 19.3 points and is shooting 49.7%,
including 48.7% from three-point range. Both were well over 50% before
the last two games, when he had consecutive four-for-12 performances.</TE>
<TE>   "I've been out of my rhythm, and the way to get back in it is to keep
shooting," he said. "Don't shy away. I've been doing it the same way for
three [seasons]. You just fight through it."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Paul Graham is enthusiastic and energetic, but in two seasons as
Washington State coach, he has been unable to halt a remarkable
streak--the Cougars have never defeated UCLA in Los Angeles, losing 45 in
a row in a series dating to 1950.</TE>
<TE>   For the 50-year-old Graham, that's basically a lifetime.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a tough part of the schedule, coming down here and playing
UCLA and USC back to back," he said. "At least we are through with the
Southern California schools early."</TE>
<TE>   Washington State traditionally recruits players from the Southland,
which Graham has discovered can be problematic during this trip.</TE>
<TE>   "It's like coming home," he said. "There's grandmother, and Aunt Suzie
and Uncle Joe to visit, and all the guys want to do well. But I have to
keep reminding them it's a business trip, not a pleasure cruise."</TE>
<TE>   Four Cougar starters are from Southern California. Point guard Marcus
Moore grew up in Inglewood. Guard Mike Bush is from Riverside, forward
Milton Riley is from Gardena and guard Jerry McNair is from Torrance.</TE>
<TE>   "All my friends were at the game [Friday night]," Moore said Saturday.
"I'm going to see them all. In fact, I'm going home right now."</TE>
<TE>   Graham is concerned the Cougars might play for the crowd.</TE>
<TE>   "Like with Marcus, I've got to keep him focused so he doesn't try to
do too much," he said. "Same with Bush."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Bush, a senior guard averaging 14 points, is finally a full-time
basketball player. He was a receiver on the Cougar football team, which
completed its season Dec. 31 with a victory in the Sun Bowl.</TE>
<TE>   But Bush, who scored 10 points against USC, sat out practice Saturday
because of flu and took fluids intravenously.</TE>
<TE>   "Mike's a tough kid," Graham said. "For him to have done what he's
done--one week he practiced twice a day, football in the morning and
basketball at night. His body is saying, 'Hey look, I need a rest.'</TE>
<TE>   "If he can walk, he'll play. He's a tough kid and likes the challenge
of playing against good players."</TE>

<DH>College basketball: Guard makes most of chance as Pepperdine beats
BYU in overtime.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ERIC STEPHENS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Craig Lewis has learned the hard way that Pepperdine Coach Paul
Westphal isn't shy about making lineup changes.</LD>
<LD>   A starter most of last season and every game this season until the
Waves' last game against West Virginia, the shooting guard has watched
his minutes drop precipitously. On Saturday night against Brigham Young,
he played only nine.</LD>
<LD>   That didn't keep him from making an impact. Lewis made two three-point
baskets in overtime and drew a charging foul to prevent a game-tying
attempt as Pepperdine held on to defeat the red-hot Cougars, 82-79,
before an overflow crowd of 3,378 at Firestone Fieldhouse.</LD>
<TE>   The victory capped a grueling nonconference schedule for Pepperdine
(7-6). The results were mixed with victories over UCLA and USC and losses
to Oregon, Arizona and Georgia, but Westphal is glad to accept the mark.
BYU (10-3) had won eight in a row, including an upset of Stanford.</TE>
<TE>   "Considering that probably only three games we were favorites in and
some of those wins coming against ranked teams, I'm very pleased," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   Lewis was averaging 11.1 points to rank third on the team. But he
started and played only 10 minutes against Arizona and 11 against West
Virginia in a reserve role.</TE>
<TE>   The senior didn't enter Saturday's game until only four minutes
remained in the second half. Instead of sulking, Lewis waited patiently
and provided a lift as soon as he entered. He made two free throws and
drilled a three-pointer to give Pepperdine a 63-61 lead with 1:49
remaining.</TE>
<TE>   "Every player wants to come out and play a lot and play well," Lewis
said. "Sometimes, it's not your turn and you have to wait until it's your
turn. I have to be ready when Coach calls on me."</TE>
<TE>   It was Lewis' defense on Travis Hansen that made the difference. Jimmy
Miggins, who led Pepperdine with 19 points, made a layup with 16.8
seconds left for a three-point lead.</TE>
<TE>   Hansen carried BYU in the second half with 23 of his game-high 32
points and also had a career-high 17 rebounds. He got the ball on the
right wing with 8.8 seconds and looked to create some separation to
launch a three-point try.</TE>
<TE>   Lewis stayed close to the bigger Hansen and drew the charge. Terrance
Johnson missed two free throws on the other end but Miggins grabbed the
loose ball and the Cougars never got another chance.</TE>

<HD>Highs and Lows for Craven</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PAUL GUTIERREZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>USC freshman guard Errick Craven was anything but melancholy after
following last weekend's career-high 29-point performance against
Washington State with a subpar six-point outing against the Cougars on
Friday night.</LD>
<LD>   "I just made some dumb fouls and got in early foul trouble," said
Craven, who missed his first four shots and was held scoreless in six
first-half minutes. "I was overly aggressive."</LD>
<LD>   It didn't matter as the Trojans rolled to a 21-point victory against
Washington State, 85-64.</LD>
<TE>   "We've got too many weapons," Craven said.</TE>
<TE>   Although Craven struggled, five different Trojans scored in double
figures. Craven was picked up by the guard he replaced in the starting
lineup, sophomore Desmon Farmer.</TE>
<TE>   Farmer began the year as a starter but his often erratic, though
electric, play relegated him to substitute status on Coach Henry Bibby's
bench.</TE>
<TE>   "I just want to play," an exasperated Farmer said after scoring 15
points on seven-of-11 shooting in 25 minutes. "If that's what coach wants
me to do, I'll accept it, being that spark off the bench.</TE>
<TE>   "It's kind of hard. I thought I'd take the place of [former USC guard
Jeff] Trepagnier. But coach thinks it would be better for the team if I
watch the game and then come in. I'm all about the win. Whatever it takes
to get the win."</TE>
<TE>   Bibby, though, is still not sure if Farmer has accepted his role.</TE>
<TE>   "Desmon, I think, is his own worst enemy," Bibby said. "He gets
wrapped up in starting and that takes him out of his game.</TE>
<TE>   "It's good when a guy can come in and pick up the slack and everyone
else knows he can do that. People are starting to realize that we have
other players besides [Sam] Clancy, [David] Bluthenthal and [Brandon]
Granville to be concerned about."</TE>
<TE>   Thoughts of a redshirt year for Derrick Craven, Errick's twin brother,
came to a halt when the freshman point guard played the final two minutes
Friday.</TE>
<TE>   "I was pretty nervous," said Craven, who had been sidelined because of
a stress fracture in his right leg. "I just need to take my time."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   USC officials handed a tape of an alleged incident at Washington last
week in which Errick Craven and Jerry Dupree were hit by errant elbows to
Pacific 10 spokesman Dave Hirsch Friday night.</TE>
<TE>   Hirsch will take the tape to the league offices for review by league
coordinator of men's basketball officiating Lou Campanelli, who will make
a judgment for punishment should he deem it necessary.</TE>

<LD>Long Beach State 68, Cal State Fullerton 60--Forward Kevin Roberts
scored 17 points and had five rebounds as the 49ers earned their first
Big West Conference victory of the season before 1,924 at the Pyramid.</LD>
<LD>  Long Beach, which lost to first-year conference member UC Riverside on
Thursday, improved to 5-9 overall and 1-2 in the Big West with its fifth
consecutive victory over the Titans.</LD>
<LD>   'We have been up and down and inconsistent, but I think we came in and
played pretty hard and pretty consistently tonight,' Long Beach Coach
Wayne Morgan said.</LD>
<TE>  Roberts, a 6-foot-7, 225-pound sophomore from Petaluma, scored 10
points in the first half as the 49ers outscored Fullerton, 21-8, in the
final 8 minutes 46 seconds for a 32-20 halftime lead. The Titans did
themselves no favors by making only seven of 29 shots (24%).</TE>
<TE>   Fullerton pulled to within six points several times in the second
half, but was unable to launch a serious threat.</TE>
<TE>  Fullerton forward Pape Sowe made a basket and a free throw with 27.9
seconds left to make the score, 64-58, before Roberts and Tony Darden
each made one free throw and Rudy Williams made two to seal the victory.</TE>
<TE>  Fullerton, which played well but lost to UC Irvine on Thursday, dropped
to 3-10 and 0-4 in the Big West, its worst start in conference play since
going 0-4 during the 1993-94 season. 'Every game has its own identity,
but we can't seem to get over the hump,' Fullerton Coach Donny Daniels
said.</TE>
<TE>  Guard Ron Johnson had 12 points and center Travis Reed added 10 for
Long Beach, which goes on the road for games at Idaho and Utah State.</TE>
<TE>   Sow had 15 points and 10 rebounds for Fullerton, which plays next
Saturday at Riverside. Guard Kevin Richardson had nine points for the
Titans</TE>

<LD>Cal State Northridge 70, Pacific 59--The Matadors built and lost a
19-point advantage, but regained the lead and hung on down the stretch
for a Big West Conference victory in front of 1,082 at Northridge.</LD>
<LD>   Ian Boylan, who had not scored in his last two games and had made only
one of 14 shots from the floor in his last three, led Northridge (3-9,
2-1) with 15 points and seven rebounds. Markus Carr added 11 points,
eight steals and five assists, and Jermar Welch and Curtis Slaughter each
had 10 points.</LD>
<LD>   Slaughter, Carr and Lionel Benjamin (nine points) helped stake the
Matadors to their biggest leads since a 101-47 victory over Dominican in
the second game of the season by sparking a 19-0 run that turned an 18-17
deficit into a 36-18 advantage near the end of the half.</LD>
<TE>   Bothered by Northridge's full-court press, Pacific (9-4, 1-2) did not
score for nearly eight minutes before Mike Preston hit two free throws to
end the half.</TE>
<TE>   After Northridge's lead was stretched to 39-20 early in the second
half, the Tigers closed to within 13 points at 43-30, then used a 27-12
spurt that included eight consecutive baskets from three-point range to
take a 57-55 lead.</TE>
<TE>   Northridge's Ed Estavan responded with a three-pointer of his own and
the Matadors took the lead for good with 5:58 to go.</TE>

<LD>Stanford Coach Tara VanDerveer was only partially pleased with a
two-game sweep of an East Coast road trip.</LD>
<LD>   Sebnem Kimyacioglu scored 14 points in a reserve role, as No. 5
Stanford routed Fordham, 81-55, in New York and extended its winning
streak to six games Saturday.</LD>
<LD>   T'Nae Thiel and Lindsey Yamasaki each had 11 points for Stanford
(14-1), which led, 46-31, at halftime.</LD>
<TE>   It was a better performance than the one the Cardinal turned in
Wednesday night, when Stanford edged Rutgers, 50-46, VanDerveer said.</TE>
<TE>   "I was very disappointed in the game at Rutgers. We did not play to
our potential," VanDerveer said. "I never think about the opponent, I
only want to play to our potential. Today we did that."</TE>
<TE>   The Cardinal is 8-0 on the road.</TE>
<TE>   Patty Williams had 14 points for the Rams (3-9), who have lost five of
six.</TE>
<TE>   Lara Hanson had 13 points, and Mobolaji Akiode added 12.</TE>
<TE>   Nicole Powell, who had game-highs of nine rebounds and six assists to
go with eight points, hit a three-pointer to put the Cardinal ahead for
good, 9-6, at 17:27.</TE>
<TE>   The Rams, behind Williams' jumper, got within 16-15 at 12:59.</TE>
<TE>   Stanford, which never trailed, then outscored Fordham, 23-10, for a
39-25 advantage at 3:14. Yamasaki led the run with nine points, including
two three-pointers.</TE>
<TE>OTHER GAMES</TE>
<TE>   LaNeishia Caufield scored 23 points, and Rosalind Ross added 21 points
and 12 rebounds as No. 3 Oklahoma beat No. 9 Texas Tech, 80-68, at
Lubbock, Texas. The Sooners (12-1, 2-0 in Big 12) took a 24-3 lead and
dominated throughout. Natalie Ritchie and Amber Tarr led Texas Tech (9-3,
1-1) with 13 points each.... Lindsey Wilson scored 19 of her 23 points in
the first half, and No. 4 Iowa State (13-1) rebounded from its first loss
by beating Nebraska, 88-54, in Ames, Iowa. Angie Welle, who had been
questionable because of back spasms, added 14 points for Iowa State
(13-1, 1-1 Big 12), which had a 26-game home-court winning streak ended
in a 69-63 loss to Kansas State on Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   Chantelle Anderson scored a game-high 22 points to lead No. 6
Vanderbilt past Penn State, 77-62, in Nashville. Playing in front of

Vanderbilt (13-3) took a 16-6 lead five minutes into the game and led at
halftime, 39-19.... Nicole Ohlde had 26 points and 13 rebounds as Kansas

Syreeta Bromfield had 20 points and nine rebounds as Michigan State upset
No. 8 Georgia, 70-49, in East Lansing, Mich., for the Spartans' first

last season's opener.</TE>
<TE>   Cheryl Ford had 22 points and 14 rebounds as No. 13 Louisiana Tech
beat Texas El Paso, 90-53, in a Western Athletic Conference game in
Ruston, La., for its sixth victory in a row. Louisiana Tech also ran its
streak to 56 consecutive conference victories at home.... Nikki Teasley
had 21 points and six steals, and No. 19 North Carolina used a
suffocating defense and accurate shooting in the second half to defeat
Lehigh, 76-47, at Chapel Hill, N.C. North Carolina's defense forced 13
steals and 24 Lehigh turnovers as the Tar Heels (12-2) stretched their
lead in the second half on 56% shooting.</TE>
<TE>   Delacey Joseph's jumper at the buzzer lifted No. 22 Tulane past
Southern Mississippi, 69-68, in a Conference USA opener in New Orleans.
Teana McKiver scored a game-high 33 points for Tulane (13-2).</TE>

<HD>No. 1 Connecticut Leaves No Doubt</HD>
<DH>Women's basketball: Huskies hammer No. 2 Tennessee, 86-72, before
record 24,611.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE TERRY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>KNOXVILLE, Tenn.</DL>
<LD>There's only so much room at the top and for now Connecticut is
taking all of it.</LD>
<LD>   Second-ranked Tennessee was supposed to be the first test of the
2001-02 season for the top-ranked Huskies. But the Lady Volunteers wound
up being overrun like every other Connecticut opponent, falling 86-72
before 24,611 at Thompson-Boling Arena.</LD>
<LD>   The largest crowd ever to see a women's Division I game and a national
television audience saw firsthand what Tennessee Coach Pat Summitt would
call "the gap between number one and number two"--as well as the gap
between the Huskies and the rest of women's college basketball.</LD>
<TE>   Connecticut (16-0) did more than just ride the shooting of sophomore
Diana Taurasi, a former Chino Don Lugo High standout who made 11 of 16
shots and scored a career-high 32 points.</TE>
<TE>   The Huskies vexed the Lady Volunteers (11-1) defensively, holding them
to 37.5% shooting (27 of 72), and made 57.1% of their attempts (32 of
56). They battered Tennessee on the boards, 41-33, led by forward Tamika
Williams with 15 rebounds (and 13 points).</TE>
<TE>   And when Connecticut decided to secure the victory, it did so
emphatically. The Huskies were nursing a 47-44 lead with 14:27 left to
play and ripped a 27-9 run over the next 7:57 to lead 74-53.</TE>
<TE>   Tennessee, led by Kara Lawson's 17 points, spent the remaining time
trying to make the final score respectable, but still suffered its third
home loss to Connecticut in five games at the Thompson-Boling Arena,
which opened in 1987.</TE>
<TE>   "We came into the game feeling we had to defend really well and
rebound exceptionally well," Connecticut Coach Geno Auriemma said. "I
thought Tamika in the first half kept us in the game with her rebounding,
and then Swin Cash [16 points, 10 rebounds] took over for periods of
time.</TE>
<TE>   "And then Diana, single-handedly at times, did what she is so capable
of doing."</TE>
<TE>   Summitt could understand her youngish team losing to an experienced,
senior dominated group like the Huskies, but she was unhappy with the
Lady Volunteers' effort.</TE>
<TE>   "Connecticut was clearly the more aggressive, physical basketball
team--at both ends of the floor," Summitt said. "Their front-court people
play with so much energy. Their guard play was terrific; we didn't have
an answer for Taurasi.</TE>
<TE>   "But the one thing that stands out in my mind was how active and
aggressive [the Huskies] played the entire game. We were passive and
stood around."</TE>
<TE>   The first 16 minutes were the kind of game expected from the nation's
top two teams. No sustained runs; only six lead changes and six ties
while Huskies and Lady Volunteers probed and poked for soft spots in the
defenses.</TE>
<TE>   But some things were becoming clear.</TE>
<TE>   Connecticut's inside combo of Cash and Williams were making Michelle
Snow a non-factor. The 6-foot-5 Tennessee center was constantly pushed
out of position and never got a clear look at the basket. Snow missed her
first five shots and didn't score until there were 64 seconds left in the
half. She finished with 14 points and made only five of 15 shots.</TE>
<TE>   Taurasi, on the other hand, was looking like the coolest player on the
floor, whizzing through the Lady Volunteers' defense with a variety of
swooping layups and outside jump shots. She had 15 points at the half as
Connecticut took a 47-41 lead. She never let up in the second half,
making three timely three-point baskets that kept Tennessee from staging
a comeback.</TE>
<TE>   Taurasi said she was motivated by memories of last season's game at
Knoxville, when she fouled out despite 24 points.</TE>
<TE>   "I was glad we won, but last year was miserable; it was the worst
feeling ever in that locker room," she said.</TE>
<TE>   That seems to be a feeling this Connecticut squad is passing on to
every opponent.</TE>

<HD>Koznick Finishes Behind Paerson in Slalom Again</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Anja Paerson keeps winning World Cup women's slaloms and American
Kristina Koznick keeps finishing second.</LD>
<LD>   Paerson, the world champion, maintained her first-run lead Saturday at
Maribor, Slovenia, to easily win her third consecutive slalom race.</LD>
<LD>   The 20-year-old Swede compiled an aggregate time of 1 minute, 38.05
seconds. Koznick, of Burnesville, Minn., was 1.19 seconds
behind--runner-up to Paerson for the second straight slalom.</LD>
<TE>   "I skied the first race well and made two mistakes in the second, and
Anja didn't," said Koznick, who has four slalom victories and was second
to Paerson in the last slalom, in Lienz, Austria.</TE>
<TE>   Laure Pequegnot of France was third, 1.25 seconds back, with Tanja
Poutiainen of Finland in fourth.</TE>
<TE>   Sarah Schleper of Vail, Colo., less at home in the slalom than in the
faster disciplines, was seventh. Defending World Cup champion Janica
Kostelic, struggling to regain her form after three off-season knee
operations, was ninth.</TE>
<TE>   Judging by her superior speed and agility, Paerson will be the skier
to beat in the slalom at the Feb. 8-24 Salt Lake City Games.</TE>
<TE>   "The Olympics are the high point of this season, and I feel in really
great shape," Paerson said. "Nobody is unbeatable, but I feel very close
to this."</TE>
<TE>   Koznick, whose form also is rising as the Olympics draw closer,
responded: "We'll see about that." There is another World Cup slalom
today in Maribor.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Didier Cuche of Switzerland won the men's giant slalom at Adelboden,
Switzerland, to post his first World Cup victory in nearly four years.</TE>
<TE>   Cuche, among the top 10 in more than 30 races over the past three
seasons without ever winning, delivered two aggressive runs for a winning
combined time of 2 minutes, 23.99 seconds.</TE>
<TE>   He finished 1.15 seconds ahead of Frederic Covili of France to collect
his first career win in the giant slalom. Cuche's only other World Cup
victory came in a downhill in Kitzbuehel, Austria, in 1998.</TE>
<TE>   Dane Spencer was the top U.S. skier, finishing 10th in 2:26.74. Bode
Miller, the first American since 1983 to win a World Cup slalom and giant
slalom, was 13th.</TE>
<TE>   Erik Schlopy, 13th after the opening run, nearly crashed early in the
second run, dropping to 27th.</TE>
<TE>   Cuche nearly crashed four gates into the final leg, catching his
inside ski before making a brilliant recovery and regaining his
composure.</TE>
<TE>   At the finish, Cuche dropped to the ground for several moments. He
rose to his feet with tears in his eyes as teammates and rivals rushed to
congratulate him.</TE>
<TE>   World Cup overall leader Stephan Eberharter of Austria was eighth in
2:26.16.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Krissy Wendell scored two goals, and Natalie Darwitz had a goal and an
assist to lead the U.S. women's hockey team to a 3-1 victory over Canada
in an exhibition at Chicago.</TE>
<TE>   The Americans beat Canada for the sixth consecutive time and improved
to 25-0 on their pre-Olympic schedule. Canada fell to 11-6.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Alaskan skiers Lars Flora and Kikkan Randall won the opening sprint
races in the U.S. cross country championships at Bozeman, Mont. ... Felix
Gottwald of Austria won a Nordic combined World Cup event for the fourth
time this season and Todd Lodwick of the U.S. finished in fourth place at
Schonach, Germany. The event featured two ski jumps and a 15-kilometer
cross-country race. ... Defending World Cup champion Per Elofsson of
Sweden won the pursuit cross-country event at Val di Fiemme, Italy to
extend his World Cup lead with a half-minute victory. Russia's Larissa
Lazutina won the women's five-kilometer pursuit.</TE>

<DH>Figure skating: Eldredge and his coach return to Southern
California for the U.S. championships at Staples Center.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HELENE ELLIOTT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>This week's U.S. Figure Skating Championships will be old home week
for Todd Eldredge and his coach, Richard Callaghan, for several reasons.</LD>
<LD>   Eldredge, a five-time men's champion, calculated this will be his 17th
national competition, including novice and junior championships. In
addition, Eldredge and Callaghan are familiar with Southern California,
having been based in San Diego in the early 1990s before they moved to
Rochester Hills, Mich.</LD>
<LD>   "We were in San Diego four years, and it was kind of nice," Callaghan
said. "We left because the training facility in Michigan was excellent
and the number of hours and times of day we would have the ice were
better.</LD>
<TE>   "I didn't leave San Diego willingly, believe me. It's so nice to be
outdoors in this weather. It's awesome."</TE>
<TE>   Eldredge was among the few senior-level men who took advantage of
Saturday's first official practice at HealthSouth Training Center in El
Segundo. Arriving early obliged him to miss a chance to participate in
the Olympic torch relay today in Michigan, but he hopes to get another
opportunity, perhaps when the flame arrives in California on Jan. 14.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm going to try to see if maybe that can be worked out," he said.
"It would be fun."</TE>
<TE>   Callaghan will also coach senior women's competitor Stacy Pensgen and
senior pair Larisa Spielberg and Craig Joeright this week. But he's more
relaxed than he was in 1998, when the U.S. championships last served as
the Olympic qualifier and he coached Eldredge and Tara Lipinski. Eldredge
won and Lipinski was second; Eldredge finished fourth at the Nagano Games
but Lipinski upset Michelle Kwan to win.</TE>
<TE>   "Half the stress," Callaghan said of this year's event.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The first skaters arrived Friday, with more on hand Saturday for the
first practices at the Sports Arena and HealthSouth. So far, so good,
said Larry Kriwanek, chairman of the organizing committee.</TE>
<TE>   "We really didn't have any snafus, other than maybe a bus breakdown,"
he said. "It went way smoother than any previous competition I can
remember."</TE>
<TE>   Security will be tight at every practice and competition venue, with
the LAPD providing most of the protection. Buses traveling among hotels
and venues will have a motorcycle police escort and officers will ride on
some buses. In addition, police will do a security check on each bus
before it begins its route and will conduct spot checks on people
boarding or leaving buses.</TE>
<TE>   "People are cooperating and are used to dealing with new security
measures," Kriwanek said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Kriwanek said ticket sales for the week picked up after a brief lull.
For the most popular event, the women's final, the lower bowl at Staples
Center is sold out and about 2,000 tickets remain in the upper bowl.
"Other events are up there where they're consistent with that," he said.</TE>
<TE>   He also said next Sunday's exhibition will break attendance and
revenue records. "Our goal is to leave a legacy for local ice athletes,"
Kriwanek said.</TE>
<TE>   Proceeds from the championships will go to the Southern California Ice
Foundation and will be distributed as grants to deserving athletes.
Kriwanek and other members of the organizing committee work on a
volunteer basis and take no salary. "It probably ends up costing us, but
we love it," he said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   About 800 volunteers have been credentialed and about 2,000 media and
official credentials were issued, Kriwanek said. "It's an Olympic year,
so we have national and international people," he said, "so the press
presence is very heavy."</TE>
<TE>Today's Schedule</TE>
<TE>   At Sports Arena</TE>
<TE>   Time:  Event</TE>
<TE>   11 a.m.:  Novice men short program</TE>

<HD>Porter, Spurs Pay Back Mavericks</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Terry Porter refused to be burned by the Dallas Mavericks again.</LD>
<LD>   Ten days after an overtime loss at San Antonio, Porter pulled the
Spurs past the Mavericks by scoring 22 points, including two free throws
with 5.1 seconds left, for a 105-103 victory Saturday night at Dallas.</LD>
<LD>   "Terry Porter's been huge for years now and he did great for us
tonight," said Tim Duncan, who had 29 points and 17 rebounds. "He's a
big-game and a big-shot player, and he showed it."</LD>
<TE>   Porter, a 17-year veteran, was needed because Duncan fouled out with
1:49 left and David Robinson stumbled as the Spurs couldn't preserve a
103-95 lead.</TE>
<TE>   Dallas scored eight consecutive points to tie the score with 9.3
seconds left on a tip-in by Dirk Nowitzki, who had 28 points and 14
rebounds. Robinson missed two free throws and committed an offensive foul
during the Mavs' run.</TE>
<TE>   With their Midwest Division lead on the line, the Spurs brought the
ball in to Porter and as he drove to the basket he knocked heads with
Dallas' Steve Nash. Nash came away from the collision with a foul and a
bloody gash over his left eyebrow.</TE>
<TE>   "It's easy to second guess," Nash said. "Sometimes, that's the way it
goes."</TE>
<TE>   Porter made the two free throws.</TE>
<TE>   The Mavericks lost their second in a row after a 10-game winning
streak and lost Michael Finley, who re-injured the strained left
hamstring that kept him out of two of the previous three games. He left
with 8:36 to play.</TE>
<TE>   The Interstate 35 matchup is rapidly developing into a nice rivalry.</TE>
<TE>   "It's going to be like that over and over and over," Spur Coach Gregg
Popovich said. "Nobody has the upper hand over anybody else."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Sacramento 118, Phoenix 112--Chris Webber scored 22 of his 35 points
in the second half and the Kings withstood a fourth-quarter rally at
Phoenix to win their sixth in a row.</TE>
<TE>   "You just jump on his back and ride him because he's such a special
player," said Doug Christie, who scored 12 of his 20 points in the first
quarter when Webber was two for seven from the floor. "He draws so much
attention, it gives opportunities to some other guys."</TE>
<TE>   Webber was five for five from the field in the fourth quarter after an
eight for 22 start.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm getting healthy," Webber said. "Even though we got off to a good
start [this season], we're playing better now."</TE>
<TE>   Peja Stojakovic scored 25 points for the Kings, who blew a 16-point
first-quarter lead before rebounding to pull within a half-game of the
idle Lakers in the Pacific Division.</TE>
<TE>   Stephon Marbury scored a season-high 35 points to lead the Suns, who
have dropped three consecutive. Rodney Rogers had 19 points and Shawn
Marion scored 14 for Phoenix.</TE>
<TE>   Webber scored five consecutive points to start the fourth quarter and
give the Kings a 90-78 lead with 10:31 to play.</TE>
<TE>   Boston 90, New York 81--Paul Pierce scored 28 points and contributed
to a strong defensive effort that led the Celtics at New York.</TE>
<TE>   Antoine Walker scored 22 points for Boston and Tony Battie had 13.</TE>
<TE>   Marcus Camby led the Knicks with 21 points and 19 rebounds.</TE>
<TE>   The Celtics defeated the Knicks at Madison Square Garden for the
second time this season.</TE>
<TE>   New York has made a habit of blowing double-digit leads at home, and
the Knicks wasted no time doing it again. The Knicks scored the first 10
points, but the Celtics responded with a 21-5 run.</TE>
<TE>   The Celtics outscored New York, 29-12, in the fourth quarter, holding
the Knicks to two for 18 shooting.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought we played outstanding defense," Boston Coach Jim O'Brien
said. "We tried to make sure their touches were further away from the
basket than normal, so we double-teamed them until they were about 17 or
18 feet away."</TE>
<TE>   Utah 113, Chicago 111--John Stockton made three free throws in the
final 42 seconds of overtime and the Jazz held off the Bulls at Chicago.</TE>
<TE>   Karl Malone scored 32 points for Utah and Donyell Marshall added 25,
including two of the Jazz's first three baskets in overtime. Scott
Padgett tied his career high with 16 points.</TE>
<TE>   The victory was Utah's eighth in a row over the Bulls, dating to 1997.</TE>
<TE>   After trailing by 15 points in the third quarter, Chicago rallied,
tying the score, 100-100, on Marcus Fizer's three-point play with 34
seconds left.</TE>
<TE>   Ron Mercer led the Bulls with 29 points and Ron Artest had 23 points,
six rebounds and six steals before fouling out with 1:14 left in
regulation.</TE>
<TE>   New Jersey 89, Charlotte 80--Jason Collins had 18 points and 12
rebounds, both career highs, and fellow rookie Richard Jefferson had 16
points for New Jersey at Charlotte, N.C.</TE>
<TE>   The Nets played without Kenyon Martin, suspended for two games earlier
in the day for a flagrant foul and throwing a punch at Tracy McGrady on
Friday, and Keith Van Horn, who had a stomach virus.</TE>
<TE>   Elden Campbell led Charlotte with 26 points and 13 rebounds.</TE>
<TE>   Minnesota 112, Atlanta 96--Wally Szczerbiak scored 23 points and Kevin
Garnett had 22 points and 14 rebounds at Atlanta for the Timberwolves,
who won their fourth in a row.</TE>
<TE>   Minnesota outrebounded the Hawks, 56-34, and outscored them, 48-36, in
the key.</TE>
<TE>   Garnett didn't notice that the Hawks seemed to concede inside matchups
in the second half.</TE>
<TE>   "I noticed right off the bat when we got up they felt like they had to
play catch-up. Then once that fatigue set in, it made it that much harder
for them," Garnett said.</TE>
<TE>   Shareef Abdur-Rahim scored 20 points for the Hawks.</TE>
<TE>   Detroit 101, Cleveland 91--Jerry Stackhouse scored 22 of his game-high
29 points in the second half at Auburn Hills, Mich., and the Pistons won
for the second time in 11 games.</TE>
<TE>   Stackhouse's biggest play might have been a fourth-quarter block of
Zydrunas Ilgauskas' shot.</TE>
<TE>   Detroit led by six points when Stackhouse swatted the 7-foot-3
Ilgauskas' shot from behind and turned the resulting fastbreak into two
free throws.</TE>
<TE>   Cliff Robinson had 22 points and nine rebounds for the Pistons, and
Corliss Williamson had 14 points and a season-high 11 rebounds.</TE>
<TE>   Ilgauskas led Cleveland with 20 points.</TE>

<HD>They Hope to Avoid Fall on Trip</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Standing on Shaquille O'Neal's wounded feet, pulling hollow breaths
from Kobe Bryant's tender ribs, the Lakers set out Saturday morning for
their first consequential trip of the season.</LD>
<LD>   In seven days they will play five games, including two on successive
days.</LD>
<LD>   Generally, the Lakers aren't much on regular-season
back-to-backs--three of their six defeats are in the second of those
games, to juggernauts Phoenix, Memphis and Golden State.</LD>
<TE>   By the time their chartered jet clears Chicago airspace late Saturday
night, the Lakers will have ground through seven games in seven cities
over 11 days. Four of the coming foes--Toronto tonight, Detroit on
Tuesday, Indiana on Wednesday and Minnesota on Friday--are assumed to be
playoff destined.</TE>
<TE>   The trip concludes in Chicago with Phil Jackson's former and sorry
Bulls, last place in the Central Division. Easy enough, one should think,
except the Lakers already have made the seasons for the dregs of the
Pacific (Warriors) and Midwest (Grizzlies) divisions.</TE>
<TE>   They left on a three-game winning streak, and with O'Neal rested if
not entirely healthy. Bryant will wear his rib pad for another game or
two, but ran freer in Friday's 32-point win over Phoenix than he had in
any game since Dec. 21, when he suffered the right-side strain.</TE>
<TE>   "We're looking forward to this challenge," Bryant said. "We're all
excited."</TE>
<TE>   In the meantime, the Lakers have discovered some things about
themselves, about the players farthest to Jackson's right.</TE>
<TE>   With O'Neal in street clothes, Samaki Walker played a decent center
and Slava Medvedenko had his moments at power forward, particularly on
the offensive side.</TE>
<TE>   With all the extra touches, Derek Fisher shot himself out of his
offensive slump, and Mark Madsen had nine rebounds in 13 minutes against
the Suns, which is what the Lakers require of him.</TE>
<TE>   "That's a good way to get off and get onto the road," Jackson said
late Friday. "We feel real good about our bench, being able to go 10
deep. Effectively, guys have played without Shaq and gotten in rhythm, so
our game is well-rounded."</TE>
<TE>   O'Neal asked his teammates for more intensity against the Suns, and
the Lakers responded with their most emphatic victory, including a
33-point fourth quarter during which O'Neal was on his feet only to cheer
the reserves.</TE>
<TE>   "I think we're starting to play a little bit better," Bryant said.
"We're at that time of the year you want to get through those phases of
us not executing as well as we should. Now we're starting to get it back
on track a little bit."</TE>
<TE>   It gets a bit more complicated starting tonight, the payment for a
light early schedule that got them this far, with the NBA's best record.
They'll play only nine home games in the next eight weeks, a road less
daunting with O'Neal around.</TE>
<TE>   "The road," Rick Fox said, "is a lot different when you have him with
you."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Walker averaged 12.8 points and 9.0 rebounds in O'Neal's five-game
layoff, and then had 11 points and 10 rebounds in 25 minutes against the
Suns.</TE>
<TE>   "I think I showed that I can hold my own, and I think that was a
question," Walker said. "I know that was key in coming here. The question
around the league was about toughness. 'Can he hold his own with the
guys? Is he aggressive enough? Is he strong enough to do it?' I think I
did, from a personal standpoint, show that I can."</TE>
<TE>   Walker jammed his right thumb against the Suns and played the second
half with it wrapped. He is expected to play tonight.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Two deadlines will pass this week, probably without any activity from
the Lakers.</TE>
<TE>   Ten-day contracts may be awarded beginning Monday, but the club will
not immediately add a player.</TE>
<TE>   Also, all player contracts become guaranteed on Thursday, and no one
is expected to be waived.</TE>
<TE>UP NEXT</TE>
<TE>   vs. Toronto Raptors</TE>
<TE>   Noon, Channel 9  Site: Air Canada Centre</TE>
<TE>   Radio: KLAC (570)</TE>
<TE>   Records: Lakers 23-6, Raptors 18-14.</TE>
<TE>   Record vs. Raptors: 0-1.</TE>
<TE>   Update: In the third of their five Shaq-less games, the Lakers lost by
three points to the Raptors at Staples Center. While Raptor swingman
Vince Carter did not play the fourth quarter because of a strained left
shoulder, the Lakers could not slow guard Alvin Williams. After taking a
game off to rest the shoulder, Carter has been back for two. He had 34
points and eight assists in the Raptors' 101-91 win against Cleveland on
Friday night. Forward Morris Peterson is expected to miss at least six
weeks because of a fractured right index finger. The Raptors activated
center Mamadou N'diaye from the injured list, and he played three minutes
against the Cavaliers. Jerome Williams had his first start of the season
in place of Peterson.</TE>

<HD>Brown Taking Act on Road--Out of Town</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Mark Heisler</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In Philadelphia, it's all over but the recriminations, which
promise to be many as Larry Brown concludes his final season, assuming,
of course, he stays the season.</LD>
<LD>   The city, picking up the pieces of its broken heart, is returning to
its primal instinct, anger. The Philadelphia Inquirer's Steve Smith
compared Brown to "a thief in the night." A Daily News headline noted,
"Larry Brown's act is getting old."</LD>
<LD>   Actually, his act was old a long time before he got there, but maybe
they missed that.</LD>
<TE>   Out here, we consider ourselves connoisseurs, having seen Brown come
and go three times--once with the Clippers, twice at UCLA, including 1988
when he accepted the Bruin job, then announced he couldn't leave Kansas,
where he stayed two more months before departing for San Antonio.</TE>
<TE>   See if any of this sounds familiar:</TE>
<TE>   * You're hopeless when he arrives.</TE>
<TE>   The 76ers were 22-60 with an impossible backcourt of Allen Iverson and
Jerry Stackhouse.</TE>
<TE>   * You go up like a rocket.</TE>
<TE>   This makes nine teams--seven pro and two college, not counting
Davidson, his first job, which he resigned within days when they didn't
carpet his office--all of which he took into the postseason where one won
an NCAA title (Kansas), another made the NCAA final (UCLA), one made the
NBA Finals (76ers), one made the ABA finals (Nuggets) and two made the
NBA Eastern finals (76ers, Pacers twice).</TE>
<TE>   * He beats on his best player until the guy is crazy.</TE>
<TE>   Actually, insiders give Brown high marks here because he had never
held still for as much as he did with Iverson.</TE>
<TE>   When Brown wasn't trying to trade Iverson or threatening to quit,
himself, he was figuring out how to work around a 5-foot-11 point guard
who didn't pass, averaged 25 shots, made 42% and regarded coaching as
"disrespect."</TE>
<TE>   All the while, Brown will have been confiding in a wide circle of
intimates, most of whom were once his assistants and are now running
teams: Indiana President Donnie Walsh and General Manager David Kahn; San
Antonio GM R.C. Buford and Coach-President Gregg Popovich; Utah GM Kevin
O'Conner, Portland Coach Mo Cheeks and Clipper Coach Alvin Gentry.</TE>
<TE>   (There's also an NCAA branch, not as close to the loop, but still
impressive: Memphis State's John Calipari, Missouri's Quinn Snyder and
Illinois' Bill Self.)</TE>
<TE>   So one never has to guess what escape scenarios whiz through Brown's
head.</TE>
<TE>   Last week, the drumbeat got so loud, Philadelphia's NBC outlet
reported GM Billy King had flown west to talk Brown out of quitting on
the spot.</TE>
<TE>   Brown issued such non-denial denials as, "I'm here."</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Denver GM Kiki Vandeweghe, who played for Brown at UCLA and
needs someone, mused that Brown was "probably the best" coach he'd ever
had.</TE>
<TE>   Brown said he loved the area so much, "We're going to live in Colorado
somewhere when I'm finished."</TE>
<TE>   While love bloomed in the Rockies, 76er owner Ed Snider was at his
Montecito winter home, assuring the Inquirer that if there were anything
to this, he'd be on the case.</TE>
<TE>   "But, obviously, I'm out here in California having a good time and all
these reports are trying to spoil that," Snider said. "But I'm not going
to let that happen."</TE>
<TE>   Of course, what would he know?</TE>
<TE>   Before last season, Snider barely knew he had an NBA team. The
longtime owner of the NHL Flyers, he got 33% of the 76ers, and
operational control, when Comcast bought majority interest.</TE>
<TE>   But until last summer's falling out, Snider let minority owner Pat
Croce tend the lowly 76ers' rehabilitation.</TE>
<TE>   The house explanation now, parroted by some hard-nosed locals, is that
Croce was a self-promoter with little impact on the basketball side, a
ridiculous postdating of history that's now being exposed.</TE>
<TE>   "Gone along with Croce is the attachment to the community the Sixers
enjoyed during his five years at the helm--regardless of the rhetoric
that the Sixers throw out there," wrote the Inquirer's Smith.</TE>
<TE>   Gone is all leadership. Without Croce, Brown is the only one left to
run the show under the detached Snider.</TE>
<TE>   And gone, soon enough, will be Brown.</TE>
<TE>   If Snider is smart, or cares, he'll catch up on Brown's history--after
returning from vacation, of course--the first rule of which is: When he
wants to go, let him.</TE>
<TE>   With Brown, when it turns down, it doesn't go back up. There are
coaches available who may be able to salvage this mess: Jeff Van Gundy,
who'd find Philly peaceful after Gotham; Mike Dunleavy, who'd find
Iverson refreshing after Rasheed Wallace.</TE>
<TE>   Brown will have his pick of jobs. If you reminded the Nuggets,
Warriors or Trail Blazers, "This only lasts two or three seasons," they'd
still want to know where to sign up.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, if you want to ride the wind, bring a parachute. With
Brown, you need your own escape scenario.</TE>
<TE>   Haunted, searching, abandoning, embracing, a genius at work, if
briefly; a romantic always finding the path of true love washed out; a
neurotic chasing a dream that isn't real.... all of it applies to Brown.</TE>
<TE>   Constant, he ain't, but Brown has a great heart, too.</TE>
<TE>   At UCLA, he told freshman Michael Holton he expected him to drop by
for chats, which often lasted hours. Holton says Brown told the guys
stuff like, "The important thing isn't what you get out of this but what
you do for others."</TE>
<TE>   Brown is assuredly a wack job but who do you know who's so normal? I
don't know about your workplace but in mine, he fits right in.</TE>
<TE>Faces and Figures</TE>
<TE>   It's OK to panic (cont.):</TE>
<TE>   * Ding, ding, ding: Portland--Adding Derek Anderson and Ruben
Patterson to a team overstocked with wing players only worsened
chemistry. Anyone who's surprised must be a blood relative of GM Bob
Whitsitt. Said Scottie Pippen to local writers, "Go ahead, we didn't put
this team together so take your best shot. There's too many different
personalities, too much yapping at the coaches, too much complaining."
Whitsitt may now have to shop Wallace. OK, who's desperate enough to take
6-11, 250 pounds of bad attitude with a $14.3-million salary?</TE>
<TE>   * Ding, ding, ding, New York--Looks like that twerp they rode out on a
wave of ingratitude could coach, after all. The Knicks, 10-9 under Van
Gundy, are 4-9 under Don Chaney. Marcus Camby said the guards weren't
passing the ball. Kurt Thomas said Camby wasn't speaking for him. Allan
Houston said they had to be more positive, which looked like an allusion
to Latrell Sprewell. Fans boo Houston, now considered a $100-Million
Player Lite. Said Thomas after the Knicks concluded a 5-9 December, "It
seems a lot worse." New York papers are full of speculation about a
Sprewell-and-Camby-for-Wallace deal. Portland insiders say that's not
enough.</TE>
<TE>   Dear scum: Miami's Pat Riley, looking for something, anything, to
revive his players, reminded them of their low estate. "They're losing
respect and dignity and all the things they fought for," he said.
"They're maimed and shown no respect from officials. Other players trash
talk them in the press." ... Voila, his wretches, who'd lost 21 of 24,
won in Indiana and Boston.</TE>
<TE>   Bobby Bowman Jr., the fan whose harangue provoked Dan Issel into his
career-ending reply, is so tired of being asked if he forgives Dan that
his father, Bobby Sr., said he's done talking, gratis, anyway. "If
Channel 2 news--or 7 or 9 or 4 or whatever--if they want to get involved
in that stuff, it is going to cost them some money," Bobby Sr. told the
Denver Post. "You can talk to me but it will cost you."</TE>
<TE>   Mr. Lucky: If the Celtics hadn't come from 16 points behind against
the Clippers, they'd have had an 0-4 trip instead of going 1-3, but Coach
Jim O'Brien isn't afraid of the big, bad West. "We've had success back at
the FleetCenter against teams from the West," he said. "We're undefeated
against them. It's always difficult to come out and play four games in
five nights. It's tough for the West to come back there and play four
games in five nights." The Celtics went 5-0 at home against Seattle,
Denver, Phoenix, Utah and Memphis but have yet to play the top five
there.</TE>
<TE>   Offering a shark a transfusion: According to the Nets' Kenyon Martin,
Michael Jordan asked him, "'You're letting a 38-year-old man do this to
you?' I said, 'I'm 24 with a bad back."' Said Jordan, after going for 45
points, "I don't think he wants to tell me that. I started attacking from
that point on."</TE>

<LD>Coach Alvin Gentry shrugged when somebody asked Saturday about
power forward Elton Brand's injured right elbow.</LD>
<LD>  "It's probably very sore," Gentry said.</LD>
<LD>  But Gentry also knows it would take a court order to get Brand off the
floor.</LD>
<TE>  Brand was in the starting lineup Saturday for the 33rd time in 33
games, leading the Clippers against the Milwaukee Bucks. He has refused
to use his injury, which happened after a hard fall last week, as an
excuse for scoring nine points Friday against Denver, 10 points Wednesday
against Sacramento and 16 Tuesday against Portland.</TE>
<TE>  "My right elbow has been giving me some problems," he said. "It's
painful right now. I don't care about scoring points right now. I know at
the end of the season I'll be averaging 20 [points] and 10 [rebounds],
and that's all that matters."</TE>
<TE>  Brand went into Saturday's game against the Bucks averaging 19.2 points
and 11.2 rebounds, leading the Clippers in both categories.</TE>
<TE>  *</TE>
<TE>  Center Michael Olowokandi's right forearm was bruised and swollen
before Saturday's game. Olowokandi was injured while blocking a shot by
Denver's James Posey near the end of the Clippers' 82-80 victory Friday.</TE>
<TE>  "I blocked his shot, but he bent my arm back and it hit the rim,"
Olowokandi said. "We'll see how it goes. I'm full of painkillers, so
hopefully I don't fall asleep out there. When you start running and your
heart starts pumping, then you don't think about it."</TE>
<TE>  *</TE>
<TE>  Brand has been invited to ring the opening bell Wednesday at the New
York Stock Exchange when the Clippers are in town to play the New Jersey
Nets.</TE>
<TE>  Brand is from Peekskill, N.Y.</TE>

<HD>Carmichael Crashes at Anaheim</HD>

<AU>DAN ARRITT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Ricky Carmichael's bid for a record-breaking 14th consecutive
supercross victory came to a horrifying end Saturday night when the
22-year-old landed head first on the track following a crash in the main
event at Edison Field in Anaheim.</LD>
<LD>   Carmichael, the defending supercross champion, was in second place
midway through the fifth lap of the 20-lap final, trailing eventual
winner David Vuilleman of France, when he cleared a small jump and landed
on his front wheel on the other side.</LD>
<LD>   Carmichael hit the ground hard with his bike landing on top of him. He
was down on the track for several minutes before walking away unassisted.
He was taken to UCI Medical Center for treatment of a possible concussion
and facial lacerations.</LD>
<TE>   Carmichael, of Havana, Fla., rode a Kawasaki last season to a
record-tying 14 victories, then swept the outdoor 250cc motocross
nationals for his seventh national championship. Citing Honda's edge in
technology, Carmichael switched to the red CR last fall, shortly before
winning his second consecutive U.S. Open of Supercross in Las Vegas.</TE>
<TE>   Jeremy McGrath, 30, who received the most applause during
introductions from the sold-out crowd of 45,050, vowed to retake the
title this season and dedicated the off-season to conditioning. But
McGrath didn't look comfortable on the Edison Field track.</TE>
<TE>   McGrath barely advanced to the main event after finishing third in his
heat, getting passed by Mike LaRocco, 30, and Travis Pastrana, 18, who is
beginning his first full season in the 250cc class. McGrath then finished
13th the main event.</TE>
<TE>   Another crowd favorite was 16-year-old James "Bubba" Stewart, the
first prominent black rider. Stewart, who broke all of Carmichael's
amateur records. while growing up in Florida, finished third in the 125cc
class.</TE>

<HD>Baffert Gets Back on Track in San Pasqual Handicap</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BOB MIESZERSKI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>So much for trainer Bob Baffert's slump.</LD>
<LD>   A winner with only one of his first 29 starters at Santa Anita, a meet
he has led five consecutive times, Baffert picked up two victories
Saturday, including a desperate win by 11-10 favorite Wooden Phone in the
$200,000 San Pasqual Handicap.</LD>
<LD>   Baffert's Puerto Banus, a first-time starter who is also the
half-brother to the stakes-winning mare Spain, won the sixth.</LD>
<TE>   Wooden Phone, the 5-year-old Pick Up The Phone gelding and one of the
top players in a soft local handicap division, overcame a tardy beginning
and a wide trip to edge 5-2 second choice Euchre by a head in 1:41 4/5
for the 1 1/16 miles on dirt.</TE>
<TE>   Owned by Tom Durant and Marilyn and James Helzer, the Florida-bred
earned his fifth win in 14 starts under jockey David Flores and his
second in eight tries at Santa Anita. Wooden Phone's only other victory
in Arcadia came when he upset Tiznow in last year's Strub Stakes.</TE>
<TE>   Most believed if Wooden Phone was going to win the San Pasqual, a
Grade II, it was going to be wire-to-wire. However, he started slow and
wound up outside of Irisheyesareflying, Red Eye and Euchre heading into
the first turn.</TE>
<TE>   "I've been so cold I've had to wear a jacket indoors," joked Baffert.
"I told David this horse didn't have to have the lead. Whenever it looks
like you are the only speed, people change their tactics.</TE>
<TE>   "I told him he could relax and stay off the pace if he wanted to. I
think the others were out to beat him and being that wide was really
tough.</TE>
<TE>   "At the three-eighths pole, I thought he was going to be in real
trouble, but he gutted it out. The last 100 yards that was just all heart
and he had the bigger heart today."</TE>
<TE>   The next race on the road to the $1 million Santa Anita Handicap on
March 2 is the $250,000 San Antonio Handicap on Feb. 3. But Baffert
indicated the $500,000 Donn Handicap on Feb. 9 at Gulfstream Park is also
a possible destination for Wooden Phone.</TE>
<TE>   "I wanted to stay close to the pace and keep my horse in the game
without making [Wooden Phone] work too hard," Flores said. "We were very
comfortable, but we were a little too wide.</TE>
<TE>   "We were really wide on the second turn and at the top of the stretch,
but he's a very game horse and he was able to get in front of them."</TE>
<TE>   Euchre was also wide and wound up three-quarters of a length in front
of Red Eye, the longest shot in the field at 43-1.</TE>
<TE>   "At about the half-mile pole, I don't know if he lost interest or what
his deal was, but he just let go of the bridle and just was not involved
in the race," said Euchre's jockey, Garrett Gomez. "When Wooden Phone
came to him, he decided it was time to get going again and he ran a good
race from there. Hopefully, he'll just keep progressing."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Monarchos, who hasn't run since finishing third in the Belmont Stakes,
worked five furlongs in 1:02 3/5 from the gate at Gulfstream Park.</TE>
<TE>   Preparing for his scheduled 4-year-old debut in the Donn Handicap, the
2001 Kentucky Derby winner had regular rider Jorge Chavez aboard for the
drill.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a maintenance move," said trainer John Ward, whose colt won
all three of his starts at Gulfstream last year, including the Florida
Derby. "The work was what we wanted. He's right on schedule."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Pisces, a 13-1 shot, rallied late to win the $150,000 Appleton
Handicap at Gulfstream Park.</TE>
<TE>   Trained by Mohammed Moubarak for the Diamond C Stable, the 5-year-old
son of Prized completed the mile over a turf course labeled good in a
slow 1:39 2/5. It was the fifth win in 16 starts for Pisces, who was
ridden by Roger Velez.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Iron Deputy, the 17-10 second choice, took over after six furlongs and
went on to a 2 3/4-lenghth win over favored D'Coach in the $83,300 Count
Fleet Stakes at Aqueduct.</TE>

<HD>Victory Over Artesia Has Narbonne Smiling</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Jamie Funn couldn't remember the last time she and her teammates
smiled so much.</LD>
<LD>  After a brutal schedule in which Harbor City Narbonne lost three times
and fell from No. 1 to No. 2 in The Times' rankings, the Gauchos finally
got a victory they needed to boost their morale, 65-39 over sixth-ranked
Artesia in a nonleague game Saturday at Lynwood High.</LD>
<LD>  "You see how happy we looked on the floor?" asked Funn, who shared
scoring honors with teammate Willnett Crockett with 11 points. "Wins are
wins, but I can't tell you the last time we were that happy."</LD>
<TE>  Happiness comes easily when a team makes 27 of 61 field-goal attempts,
including 10 of 12 in the third quarter to turn a 22-13 lead into a 47-21
blowout.</TE>
<TE>  Narbonne stretched the lead to as many as 30 points in the fourth
quarter as it improved to 10-3.</TE>
<TE>  Artesia (7-3) played without one of its posts, Cacie Pope, who was
suspended one game after being ejected from the Pioneers' loss to Long
Beach Poly.</TE>
<TE>  Pope's absence made it difficult for 6-foot-4 Lauren Ervin, who had
eight points and nine rebounds.</TE>
<TE>  Christian Jackson led Artesia with 10 points.</TE>
<TE>  Lisa Willis had 10 points for Narbonne.</TE>

<LD>A three-year starting quarterback has decided to transfer from
North Hollywood Harvard-Westlake to Pasadena Muir, which, academically,
is like going from Harvard to Cal State Northridge.</LD>
<LD>   Harvard-Westlake is a private school with student SAT averages above
1,300. Muir is a public school in which 75% of ninth graders who took the
state high school exit exam last spring failed the math portion.</LD>
<LD>   And yet no one so much as blinks when an athlete like Richard Irvin
makes such a move.</LD>
<TE>   No disrespect intended toward Muir, but it's a safe bet that he isn't
transferring for academic reasons.</TE>
<TE>   He has been Harvard-Westlake's starting quarterback since late in his
freshman season. In the last two years, the Wolverines' record is 2-17.
So what if he has been at the school since seventh grade? So what if he's
leaving behind friends and teammates? His senior year is coming up, he
wants to play college football, and he has concluded Muir offers a better
athletic opportunity.</TE>
<TE>   "The point of leaving is so my youngster can maximize his desires,"
said Irvin's mother, Helene.</TE>
<TE>   Irvin, who's 6 feet 2, lives in Santa Monica but will commute to
Pasadena with his father, who works in the area. He knows the program
because his private quarterback coach, Steve Clarkson, is friends with
Muir Coach Ron Mims. Another of Clarkson's private pupils, Ryan O'Hara,
transferred to Muir last season from Monrovia.</TE>
<TE>   Clarkson said he never told Irvin to transfer. "I don't tell a kid to
leave or stay," he said. "I'm not their parent."</TE>
<TE>   He said Irvin also sought information on Crescenta Valley, Mission
Viejo, Huntington Beach Edison, Granada Hills and Westlake Village Oaks
Christian.</TE>
<TE>   Irvin's mother said she believes Harvard-Westlake's football team has
deteriorated to the point her son has little confidence in the program
succeeding. This week, the Wolverines didn't retain second-year Coach
Chris Johnson and replaced him with freshman coach Greg Gonzalez.</TE>
<TE>   Whether Irvin stayed or left, he has a better chance of making it to a
top university with a good football team based on his intelligence and
friendly personality than his playing skills.</TE>
<TE>   Athletic scholarships are awarded on talent and individual ability,
not on how a team performs. Playing at Muir doesn't mean he's suddenly
going to move up in a recruiter's quarterback ratings.</TE>
<TE>   O'Hara transferred to Muir and got a scholarship to Arizona, but he
was recruited early--before he even played in a game for the Mustangs.
Nothing he did this season at Muir influenced Arizona's decision.</TE>
<TE>   Clarkson said Irvin is not a can't-miss college prospect.</TE>
<TE>   "He's going to have to show somebody he can play football," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The more important--and baffling--question is why parents repeatedly
make decisions to let their sons and daughters transfer based on athletic
reasons.</TE>
<TE>   Irvin is the fourth high-profile quarterback in the last two years to
transfer entering their senior year, joining O'Hara, Erik Vose and Rick
Clausen--all Clarkson clients. Vose, Clausen and O'Hara all took the
drastic step of changing residences to gain their eligibility. All had
different reasons for needing to transfer.</TE>
<TE>   Let's hope Irvin does well, because a diploma from Muir is not going
to have the same impact on college admission officers as one from
Harvard-Westlake.</TE>
<TE>   The transfer game is also being played out at Van Nuys Montclair Prep.
Ten years ago, the school received one of the harshest punishments ever
from the Southern Section. The entire athletic program was put on
probation and every team was barred from participating in the playoffs
during the 1991-92 season for recruiting violations by the football
program.</TE>
<TE>   You'd think the Mounties would have learned something from their
ordeal. But look what's happening with the boys' basketball program.
They're getting so many transfers that Athletic Director Greg Reece might
need to hire an FBI agent to help verify birth certificates and
passports.</TE>
<TE>   Last season, the Mounties got tall transfers from Yugoslavia, Cameroon
and Germany. Last month, 6-8 junior Nick Stigger from Memphis, Tenn.,
checked in.</TE>
<TE>   Reece said he'll determine this week whether Stigger is eligible to
play for the Mounties.</TE>
<TE>   Newspaper reports out of Memphis said Stigger left to improve his
academic standing. He was averaging 20.8 points for Hillcrest High.</TE>
<TE>   Maybe all these players just found their way to Montclair Prep because
they heard Mounties Coach Tyrone Fuller is a bright, energetic young
coach.</TE>
<TE>   Whatever the reason, Fuller is just doing what most coaches
do--welcome transfer students with open arms. And that's the problem.
Rarely does anyone say no to a transfer student.</TE>
<TE>   At some point, though, there's going to be a revolt. And there should
be. How many transfers is it going to take before players and parents say
enough? How many home-grown players are going to have to lose their
starting positions before someone challenges a coach or principal?</TE>
<TE>   The integrity of high school sports is being compromised again and
again by individuals determined to manipulate the system for selfish
means.</TE>
<TE>   It's up to coaches like Don Loperena of North Hills Monroe to help
save the system. He's a basketball coach who knows what his priority
is--teaching.</TE>
<TE>   "I have always believed that those who can't coach, recruit," he said.
"It depresses me to see coaches with such poor self-worth. It's as if
their self esteem is derived from their win-loss record rather than their
ability to develop our youth into hard-working, proud, ethical young men.</TE>
<TE>   "I believe that character is built when the odds are stacked against
you. It is for this reason that I welcome the challenges that most
ethical coaches face--how to compete with what you have. Programs that
win year in and year out do so with kids who are used to being recognized
as winners and stars.</TE>
<TE>   "Those coaches will never know the feeling of winning with a team of
players that have never been recognized as either."</TE>

<HD>Glendora Gets Defensive to Win</HD>

<LD>Glendora High guard Larry Monroe scorched Claremont for 20 of his
23 points in the first half Saturday night at Azusa Pacific, but it was
the Tartans' fourth-quarter defense that allowed them to pull out a 46-45
Baseline League victory.</LD>
<LD>  Glendora switched among three defenses--box and one, man to man and
zone--in the quarter to frustrate Claremont's shooters. The Wolfpack
managed only one field goal in the final eight minutes, when Shaddean
Aaron banked in a meaningless NBA-range three-pointer at the buzzer.</LD>
<LD>  "I thought we played a great defensive game," said Glendora Coach
Michael Le Duc, whose Tartans (13-1), No. 11 in The Times' rankings,
avenged a 69-60 loss to Glendora earlier in the season. "If you give any
of their great players anything at all, they can hurt you."</LD>
<TE>  Monroe, who missed most of the teams' first meeting after spraining his
right ankle in the first quarter, played like he had something to prove.</TE>
<TE>  He buried two three-pointers in the first quarter and two more in the
second as Glendora took a three-point halftime lead.</TE>
<TE>  "I was waiting for [this game]," Monroe said. "I was pumped up."</TE>
<TE>  But Claremont continually switched defenses in the second half,
limiting Monroe's effectiveness. All of his second-half points came on
free throws.</TE>
<TE>  "They did a much better job of trying to take it away from him," Le Duc
said.</TE>
<TE>  Claremont (12-5), which trailed by as many as 12 points in the first
quarter, chipped away at its deficit until tying the score at 35 late in
the third quarter on a long jumper by Aaron, who finished with a
game-high 24 points.</TE>
<TE>  The Wolfpack held the Tartans to only one field goal in the third
quarter.</TE>
<TE>  The lead changed hands several times until Glendora's Michael Mehanna
scored on a putback to give the Tartans a 43-41 advantage with about two
minutes to play.</TE>
<TE>  Perrin Johnson had a chance to tie the score with 1:39 left but made
only one of two free throws, and Mehanna gave Glendora a 46-42 lead with
a driving layup and a free throw.</TE>
<TE>  "It was scratch and claw--every loose ball, every rebound, every free
throw was significant," Claremont Coach Sal Magallanes said. "We need to
run off a nice big streak so that when we play them again, neither of us
has lost another game."</TE>

<HD>Lynwood Rolls Along</HD>
<DH>Girls' basketball: Top-ranked Knights make quick work of No. 9 Brea
Olinda, 53-29, to improve to 13-0.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARTIN HENDERSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Jeff Sink, the girls' basketball coach at Brea Olinda High, has
seen a lot of good teams through the years because his Ladycats usually
play schedules filled with national competition.</LD>
<LD>   After getting a first-hand view of Lynwood on Saturday, Sink said the
Knights could finish the season undefeated.</LD>
<LD>   Nobody has come close to beating them.Lynwood, No. 1 in The Times'
rankings, opened a 26-point lead against No. 9 Brea on its way to a 53-29
nonleague victory at home.</LD>
<TE>   "I've seen pretty much everybody at these national tournaments, and if
Lynwood uses their posts more on offense, I don't think they can be
beat," Sink said. "They made us look pretty bad."</TE>
<TE>   Lynwood's guards dominated, their full-court pressure causing many of
Brea's 28 turnovers. Andrea Adams had seven steals and Sade
Wiley-Gatewood had four.</TE>
<TE>   Adams, whose successive three-point baskets gave Lynwood a 10-0 lead
just over four minutes into the game, finished with 11 points. Janice
Bright scored a team-high 14 for Lynwood and had five rebounds in a
balanced team effort. Lorie Rayford--one of the posts Sink referred
to--had a team-high six rebounds and seven points. Audrey Taylor scored
eight and Wiley-Gatewood had seven.</TE>
<TE>   Brea bounced back from the early deficit, pulling to within 12-11 on
two baskets by Carrie Noyes early in the second quarter, but the Ladycats
went the next 8:38 without a field goal, and Lynwood went on a 19-1 run,
taking advantage of 11 Brea turnovers in the second and third quarters,
and building a 42-16 lead going into the fourth.</TE>
<TE>   Lynwood held Brea to only five of 27 field-goal attempts in the first
three quarters. Lynwood was 15 of 39 in that same span.</TE>
<TE>   "We didn't handle the pressure well at all," said Sink, whose team
dropped to 7-5. "I think we can play with anybody as long as we get into
our half-court set."</TE>
<TE>   Lynwood, which has beaten teams ranked Nos. 3, 4, 8, 13 and 14 in
various national polls, improved to 13-0.</TE>

<LD>   Only four are scheduled to go in the $100,000 Santa Ysabel Stakes and
Bella Bella Bella will be the prohibitive favorite.</LD>
<LD>   Purchased privately by Barry Irwin and Jeff Siegel's Team Valor after

$100,000 Old Hat at Gulfstream Park.</TE>
<TE>   Who's not: Ledbetter Heights and Smart In Art. Between them, the two

<LD>In an episode joltingly reminiscent of the Sept. 11 terrorism
attacks, a 15-year-old student pilot stole a small single-engine airplane
Saturday and flew it into a downtown office building in Tampa, Fla.,
killing himself and damaging the 40-story structure.</LD>
<LD>   Given the nationwide security alerts in recent weeks and the
similarity to the events of Sept. 11, when hijackers flew commercial
airliners into the World Trade Center and the Pentagon, the Florida crash
triggered a wide response from law enforcement agencies responsible for
combating terrorism.</LD>
<LD>   But the plane that crashed Saturday, a Cessna 172, could carry no more
than 40 gallons of fuel, far less than the huge quantities of fuel--about
10,000 gallons on each jet--that created deadly infernos in New York and
Arlington, Va.</LD>
<TE>   Except for the pilot, identified as 15-year-old Charles J. Bishop, of
Palm Harbor, Fla., there were no deaths or injuries in the Tampa crash.</TE>
<TE>   And, while FBI agents raced to the scene and senior government
officials were alerted, an FBI spokeswoman said a preliminary
investigation found no evidence to suggest the Florida incident involved
Osama bin Laden, the Al Qaeda network or any other terrorist
organization.</TE>
<TE>   "From what our Tampa office is telling our [Washington] command
center, there is no link to terrorism," FBI spokeswoman Angela Bell said
in Washington.</TE>
<TE>   The incident was all the more jarring and sounded alarm bells at the
highest echelons of the Pentagon because, before the plane crashed, it
apparently violated the restricted airspace around MacDill Air Force
Base, home of the U.S. Central Command. CentCom, as it is known, is
supervising the war in Afghanistan and the hunt for Bin Laden.</TE>
<TE>   Also, many of the 19 hijackers involved in last year's terrorist
attacks had received flight school training in Florida.</TE>
<TE>Youth Was Scheduled for Flight Lesson</TE>
<TE>   Instead of terrorism, the incident turned out to be a personal
tragedy.</TE>
<TE>   The Cessna pilot was a student at East Lake High School, and he was
the only person aboard the aircraft.</TE>
<TE>   It was not known whether he struck the Bank of America building on
purpose; the structure is a prominent feature of the Tampa skyline. A
portion of the plane could be seen protruding from the 28th floor of the
building, but there was no fire.</TE>
<TE>   Bishop, who was too young to be licensed for solo flight, had been a
flight student for two years and had arrived at the airport Saturday for
a 5 p.m. EST lesson, Pinellas County Sheriff's Department spokesman Greg
Tita said.</TE>
<TE>   Bishop was asked by his instructor to do a preflight check on the
Cessna 172, owned by Clearwater, Fla.-based National Aviation Holding
Inc.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, he boarded the aircraft alone and took off at 4:50 p.m.
without permission from the airport control tower, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   The tower notified the Coast Guard, and an A-60 helicopter on patrol
in the area was diverted to intercept the plane. The helicopter was able
to fly within a few yards of the plane but received no response when its
pilot gave visual signals directing the Cessna pilot to land at a small
airport near downtown Tampa, Coast Guard spokeswoman Charlotte Pittman
said in a television interview.</TE>
<TE>   Pittman said the helicopter was so close to the plane that there could
be no doubt the pilot saw the signals to land.</TE>
<TE>   The helicopter continued to follow the Cessna until it plowed into the
building just after 5 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   Tampa police and fire crews rushed to the scene and laid down foam in
case of fire.</TE>
<TE>   The 28th floor houses the law firm of Shumaker, Loop and Kendrick.
Managing partner Greg Yadley said one attorney and her husband were in
the offices at the time of the crash but were not injured. Hours before,
he said, an attorney had been at a desk the plane smashed into.</TE>
<TE>   "We were lucky," Yadley said.</TE>
<TE>   Gordon Johndroe, spokesman for the Office of Homeland Security, said
the Tampa plane crash caused great concern. Owing to the sensitivity
resulting from Sept. 11, President Bush and Thomas J. Ridge, director of
homeland security, were alerted about the incident and kept in touch with
each other--and with the Federal Aviation Administration--as more
information became available.</TE>
<TE>   "Everyone was talking to each other," Johndroe said.</TE>
<TE>   Because of the sensitivity of military operations at CentCom--its
airspace is restricted--officials there began tracking the small plane
within minutes of its ascent.</TE>
<TE>   "When airplanes veer in restricted airspace, appropriate measures are
taken," one White House official said Saturday evening. "Once the plane
took off and entered restricted airspace, they were monitoring it. I
believe the [military defense] apparatus was engaged."</TE>
<TE>   CentCom is perched on a peninsula overlooking downtown Tampa, with an
Air Force population of 3,000. About 50 other organizations are on the
sprawling base, including the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration's hurricane watch unit and two major national military
headquarters, the Special Operations Command and CentCom.</TE>
<TE>   An FAA spokesman, Christopher White, said flight operations in the
area were only briefly disrupted.</TE>
<TE>   Federal regulations set a minimum age of 16 for a pilot to receive a
solo license, but many would-be pilots begin taking lessons before that.
In fact, young pilots often solo on their 16th birthdays as a
celebration.</TE>
<TE>   And it is also common for flight instructors to send students out to
prepare planes for lessons, giving the student unsupervised access.</TE>
<TE>Questions of Motive May Never Be Answered</TE>
<TE>   Bishop had been driven to the airport by his grandmother Karen
Johnson.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not sure we'll ever know why he impacted the building in Tampa.
There were no notes left and no one here at the airport, family included,
had an indication this was going to take place," Tita said.</TE>
<TE>   The Cessna 172 is a four-seat, single-engine airplane with a top
cruising speed of about 125 mph. Often used in flight training, it is one
of the most popular light aircraft in use today and can be rented at
almost any small airport. It carries 40 gallons of usable fuel and weighs
2,300 pounds at its maximum rated capacity.</TE>

<HD>Bush Builds Strength in Crisis, Risk in Rancor</HD>
<DH>His resolute toughness is a wartime hit but promises hard times for
his domestic agenda.</DH>
<SE>First of three articles
</SE>
<AU>RONALD BROWNSTEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES POLITICAL WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>Few presidents have faced such a radical shift in circumstances so
soon after taking office as George W. Bush.</LD>
<LD>   Elected while the nation was still luxuriating in peace and
prosperity, Bush has been forced to grapple with recession and a
devastating foreign attack on the American mainland.</LD>
<LD>   As a candidate, Bush focused on domestic issues--cutting taxes,
reforming education, bolstering religious charities. Now he spends most
of his time prosecuting a distant war and trying to fortify the nation's
internal security. Even in foreign policy, he has pivoted from
emphasizing reductions in American obligations abroad to assembling a
U.S.-led coalition against terrorism.</LD>
<TE>   In all these respects, Bush is presiding over what amounts to an
inverted presidency. His first year ends with him in a very strong
political position--far stronger than seemed possible when he won his
bitterly disputed victory after losing the popular vote just over a year
ago, but arriving at it by a route utterly different from the one he set
out upon.</TE>
<TE>   Much like Bill Clinton before him, Bush came to Washington promising
to reshape the debate on domestic issues and provide his party a more
centrist image. But, as the stalemate over economic stimulus legislation
last month underscored, his presidency has tended to reinforce, rather
than realign, the traditional domestic divisions between the two
political parties, particularly over the role of government.</TE>
<TE>   Since the attacks, though, Bush has soared in public esteem for his
performance in the arena where his experience was thinnest: the
management of national security and foreign affairs. Surrounded by an
unusually seasoned team, he has become a steadying and reassuring figure,
powerfully expressing the nation's outrage over Sept. 11 and channeling
it into a fiercely efficient military campaign in Afghanistan. As much as
his domestic agenda had divided the country and Congress before the
attacks, his wartime leadership has unified them.</TE>
<TE>   "The circumstances make the person, and there's a general sense that
the president has stepped up, with an incredibly good team, in this
situation after Sept. 11," says former Commerce Secretary Bill Daley, the
campaign chairman for Al Gore, Bush's rival in the 2000 presidential
election. "I think you have to give him a solid A . . . at handling what
is the defining piece of his presidency."</TE>
<TE>   The tension between the unifying effect of the war and the centrifugal
pull of domestic disputes will shape the coming months, and perhaps the
remainder, of Bush's term. Terrorism's challenge will provide Bush
continuing opportunities to transcend traditional politics and unite the
country in his role as commander in chief.</TE>
<TE>   But domestic issues, submerged since Sept. 11, also seem certain to
resurface this year, and disputes over health care, energy, the
environment and, above all, the return of federal budget deficits could
reopen the divisions that surrounded Bush during his presidency's first
months.</TE>
<TE>   "The bipartisanship and consensus in Washington that occurred after
Sept. 11 never really took hold very firmly," says Rutgers University
political scientist Ross K. Baker. "It's really like the Christmas truce
in 1914 during World War I. The two sides came out of their trenches and
sang carols, then went back and shot at each other. That's probably what
we can expect for [this] year."</TE>
<TE>   Until Sept. 11, the defining political characteristic of Bush's term
had been polarization. Polls showed the country sharply divided along
partisan and ideological lines over Bush's agenda, his performance and
even his qualifications for the job. Burdened by the sagging economy,
Bush's overall approval rating by late summer had dipped to about 50%,
the danger zone for any incumbent.</TE>
<TE>   The Sept. 11 attacks, and Bush's response, blew all that away. In the
latest Gallup Poll, his job approval rating stood at 86%, the highest for
a president concluding his first year. On questions surrounding the war,
he's inspiring confidence even among most who doubted him.</TE>
<TE>   "His relationship to the country has changed," says John Podesta, a
White House chief of staff for President Clinton. "People accept Bush as
a guy who can lead the country and a person who has the stuff to actually
sit in the Oval Office. People questioned that; not just Democrats but a
wide swath of independent voters. I don't think they really question that
anymore."</TE>
<TE>   In many ways, the challenge of the war has highlighted Bush's personal
strengths. The war has played to Bush's preference for focusing on a few
priorities rather than grappling simultaneously with a swarm of nuanced
issues. And it has shown him again to be calm and confident in his own
judgments during moments of crisis.</TE>
<TE>   "The greater the pressure, the more focused and disciplined he gets,"
says Mark McKinnon, his chief media advisor in 2000. Says another top
White House official: "He wants to have all his options clear . . . all
the homework done. Then he makes decisions and he sleeps at night."</TE>
<TE>   Those around Bush say he's been equally comfortable making choices to
set the broad strategy and delegating the day-to-day military decisions.
He's become much more confident in the president's role as communicator
in chief, comforting and exhorting the nation. So far, in his public
statements and in the conduct of the war itself, he's found a balance
that has won broad support from voters at home and from governments
abroad. He has seemed resolute, but almost never rash, about pursuing Al
Qaeda and the Taliban.</TE>
<TE>   "He's a steady guy," says Rep. Michael N. Castle (R-Del.). "There's a
reassuring feeling."</TE>
<TE>   Yet even while winning that broad support for his management of the
war, Bush still faced pitched battles last fall over domestic issues such
as airport security and his economic stimulus package. Those conflicts
highlighted the other half of the forces shaping his presidency: domestic
disputes almost as powerful as the instinct toward wartime solidarity.</TE>
<TE>   In his first year, Bush compiled a solid overall record of moving his
ideas into law. Even with power on Capitol Hill narrowly divided between
the parties, Bush pushed through Congress the largest tax cut since
Ronald Reagan's presidency: a $1.35-trillion, 10-year package only
modestly pared down from his original proposal. He achieved a sweeping
reform of federal education programs that closely tracked his campaign
blueprint. He helped shape a rapid-fire series of wartime measures to
repair the damage of Sept. 11, stiffen security at airports and provide
federal officials new authority to monitor and pursue terrorists. And he
advanced his plans for a national missile defense and a new round of free
trade agreements.</TE>
<TE>   What Bush hasn't done is smooth the jagged lines of partisan and
ideological division in the capital. As a candidate, Bush often said he
would pursue a new era of bipartisanship and "change the tone in
Washington."</TE>
<TE>   Most Washington analysts agree that he has established an amicable
personal tone for his dealings with Congress, though even that has begun
to fray lately as the White House has winked at Republicans who have
excoriated Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle (D-S.D.). But as Bush
pursued a vanguard conservative agenda centered on limiting government
spending, retrenching regulation and reducing taxes, the policy gulf
between the two parties remained enormous.</TE>
<TE>   Among Bush's priorities, only the education bill, which was shaped
through months of unusually bipartisan negotiation, drew broad support in
both parties. Bush also attracted a respectable minority of Senate
Democrats for the scaled-back tax bill and oil-state House Democrats for
his energy plan.</TE>
<TE>   But on most important questions, the administration shaped proposals
that attracted little support across the aisle. Most tellingly, just
three of 205 Democrats voting in the House and one of 50 in the Senate
sided with Bush's initial budget. Most of Bush's initiatives faced just
as much resistance from the opposition party as Clinton's did. As a
result, the administration and the Democratic Senate remain stalemated
over a patients' bill of rights, aid to religious charities, energy
policy and campaign finance reform.</TE>
<TE>   On all these issues, centrist Democrats whom Bush courted during the
campaign complained that his agenda was much more conventionally
conservative than he had promised, leaving them little opportunity for
alliance.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think he's really persuaded many people that he is bringing
about fundamental changes in the Republican governing outlook," says Will
Marshall, president of the Progressive Policy Institute, a centrist
Democratic think tank that Bush praised during the 2000 campaign. "That
turned out to be more useful for the campaign than it did for his actual
governing philosophy."</TE>
<TE>   As in the election, Bush's legislative success depended less on
attracting Democrats than on solidifying Republicans. On virtually every
major issue, from taxes to energy, more than 90% of House Republicans
backed Bush's position, much greater support than House Democrats gave
Clinton early on.</TE>
<TE>   Resistance from three moderate Republican senators forced Bush to trim
his tax cut, and the decision by one of those three, Sen. James M.
Jeffords of Vermont, to quit the GOP and become an independent gave
Democrats control of the Senate. But overall, Senate Republicans also
supported Bush in solid numbers.</TE>
<TE>   Though some issues, such as a promised agenda to help strengthen
communities, could offer Bush opportunities for bridge-building in 2002,
the central domestic fight ahead promises more of the polarization
evident early in his term. Looming over all domestic questions in
Washington this year are the return of the federal budget deficit under
the weight of war, recession and the tax cut Bush drove through Congress
last spring.</TE>
<TE>   As spending priorities from homeland security to prescription drugs
for seniors are squeezed, a growing number of Democrats are likely to
call for rolling back the later stages of that tax cut--an idea the
president staunchly rejects. That conflict is likely to rekindle familiar
partisan firefights and overshadow any Bush effort to reposition the GOP
on domestic issues.</TE>
<TE>   "The changed budget circumstances are going to force the president to
rewrite his game plan, and the game plan is going to look much more like
the traditional Republican strategy, which is to shrink the size of
government to preserve lower tax burdens," says Robert D. Reischauer,
former director of the Congressional Budget Office.</TE>
<TE>   The paradox is that the same qualities that have made Bush such a
unifying figure in the war help explain why his agenda has been so
polarizing at home. On both fronts, Bush has displayed an unshakable
confidence in his ideas and a bulldog determination to advance them.</TE>
<TE>   That has struck the right wartime chord for a country eager to enlist
behind a resolute commander in chief after the Sept. 11 attacks. But on
domestic issues, Bush's resolve has translated into an ambitious
conservative agenda that often sweeps beyond the bounds of consensus in a
nation whose political allegiance is divided almost exactly in half. One
year into his presidency, Bush stands as both a symbol of national unity
and a reminder of our enduring divisions.</TE>

<HD>Green Beret Remembered for His 'Warrior Ethic'</HD>
<DH>Military: Nathan R. Chapman, who was killed in action Friday, also
was known for his sense of humor.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KIM MURPHY</AU>
<AU>LIANNE HART</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>FT. LEWIS, Wash.
</DL>
<LD>It didn't matter what it was, his buddies said, Nate Chapman wanted
to be there. Lending a hand. Doing the hard stuff.</LD>
<LD>   "There's a couple times where he'd be halfway dressed, running down
the hallway, trying to catch up. You know, he never wanted to be left
behind, he always wanted to be right there, willing to help and give a
hand," Sgt. 1st Class William Pence said Saturday, fighting back tears as
he recalled his Army comrade of 14 years, Sgt. 1st Class Nathan Ross
Chapman, the first U.S. soldier killed by enemy fire in Afghanistan.</LD>
<LD>   "When he was around, he always made you laugh," Pence said. "He
always, no matter how bad it [was], he always made you laugh."</LD>
<TE>   In a dwindling war without major tank battles and few direct
firefights, Chapman's death brought home to those who knew him the
reality of the distant conflict--the possibility that a man who only a
few months ago was barbecuing with his friends in suburban Washington
could die in a rocky desert on the other side of the world on a mission
his friends and family knew almost nothing about.</TE>
<TE>   "It brings the war home," Col. David Fridovich, commander of the 1st
Special Forces Group, said Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   Fridovich joined several of Chapman's friends and colleagues in the
elite 1st Special Forces Group at Ft. Lewis, about 30 miles south of
Seattle, to talk about the communications specialist, a 31-year-old Green
Beret killed by small-arms fire in an area of southern Afghanistan near
Khowst, an area known to shelter groups of Al Qaeda fighters.</TE>
<TE>   Chapman was accompanied on the mission by an unidentified CIA officer,
who suffered a serious chest wound in the fighting. A U.S. military
rescue team removed both men from the area.</TE>
<TE>   "His loss affects us deeply, but I'm convinced he was doing exactly
what he joined the Army and Special Forces to do, and that is to
contribute at the highest levels to our nation's goals and policies,"
Fridovich said.</TE>
<TE>   "Nate Chapman was a dynamic, outgoing, physically and mentally hard
soldier, known by his team to have an absolutely great sense of humor,"
he added. "He embodied not just the warrior ethic but served as a stellar
example of the Special Forces ethos."</TE>
<TE>   In Georgetown, Texas, Chapman's parents recalled a son who was
brimming with pride when he told his parents after enlisting many years
ago that he was selected for Special Forces duty.</TE>
<TE>   "He said he qualified for the Rangers," said his father, Wilbur
Chapman, a retired Air Force major. "That surprised me. We had thought he
could get some skills that would be useful when he got out of the
military. I jokingly told him there was not a big demand for what he did
when he got out. But he said he didn't want to get stuck behind a desk."</TE>
<TE>   His mother, Lynn Chapman, had a different memory: "He was my little
boy."</TE>
<TE>   Nathan Chapman's wife, Renae, was secluded in the home they had
recently purchased in Puyallup, Wash., with the couple's two children,
Amanda, 2, and Brandon, 1. Her parents and Chapman's were expected to
join her before a memorial service scheduled later this week. Chapman
also is survived by a brother, Keith, of Germantown, Md.</TE>
<TE>   In visits to Ontario and Portland, Ore., President Bush paid tribute
to the fallen soldier.</TE>
<TE>   "We mourn for Sgt. Nathan Chapman and we pray with his family for
God's blessings on them," the president said. "Nathan lost his life
yesterday. But I can assure the parents and loved ones of Nathan Chapman
that he lost his life for a cause that is just and important. And that
cause is the security of the American people, and that cause is the cause
of freedom and a civilized world."</TE>
<TE>   The 5,000 Southern Californians in the Ontario Convention Center burst
into sustained applause.</TE>
<TE>A Knack for Communication</TE>
<TE>   Chapman was remembered for his deft skill with communications
technology and computers and his sense of humor, both of which served him
in the rarefied brotherhood of the Green Berets, an organization so
tightly knit, his colleagues said, that it becomes a second family.</TE>
<TE>   "Basically, for about 12 hours a day, we work and live together," said
Pence. "Until you've experienced it, there's nothing like it. It's like a
family. We get together, we barbecue, we drink beer, we go out. We all
suffer together. The guy's right there next to you suffering, and when
it's all done, you drink the beer, laughing about it."</TE>
<TE>   Chapman, born April 23, 1970, at Andrews Air Force Base, Md.,
surprised his family during his last year at Centerville High School in
Ohio by announcing he planned to join the Army. He was so young--just
17--that his father had to sign an Army consent form.</TE>
<TE>   "A recruiter might have come to the high school--something must have
rung a bell for him," Wilbur Chapman said.</TE>
<TE>   It wasn't necessarily a surprise. Chapman had always been the
adventurous one who loved the outdoors and the smooth hum of a finely
tuned car. "He was always doing the kind of things most people might find
on the edge or dangerous. The military, particularly this kind of work,
gave him that opportunity," Campbell said.</TE>
<TE>   From there it was on to Cincinnati for a battery of tests, which
qualified him for the Army Rangers. He served on missions in Panama,
Haiti and in Desert Storm before telling his parents he had set his
sights on the Green Berets. He graduated from Green Beret training at Ft.
Bragg, N.C., where he also was trained in Army scuba diving.</TE>
<TE>   Ft. Lewis officials said he was stationed twice at the Washington
state Army base, with a deployment in Okinawa, Japan, between the two
postings.</TE>
<TE>   Assigned as a communications specialist to a 12-member Green Beret
team at Ft. Lewis, Chapman was adept at handling computers, satellite
communication and other kinds of high-frequency communications. But his
colleagues said he was also gifted in a more basic kind of communication.</TE>
<TE>Known for His Physical Prowess</TE>
<TE>   "When we were in Thailand, he was responsible for running a sniper
range. He was able to communicate the information in the class off the
top of his head through an interpreter, and also on an individual basis
with the Thai soldiers--he was able to communicate to them without using
an interpreter and without knowing the language, just because he's that
type of person," said Capt. Edwin Hoenig, detachment commander with
Chapman's unit.</TE>
<TE>   Hoenig said Chapman, over 6 feet, was also known for his physical
prowess. "He was as strong as an ox. He was always in competition . . .
to be the strongest man on the team . . . [and] the fastest man on the
team."</TE>
<TE>'A Wonderful Man, a Wonderful Child'</TE>
<TE>   In November, Chapman temporarily joined the 5th Special Forces Group
out of Ft. Campbell, Ky., for deployment in Afghanistan. He simply told
his parents he was going on a mission to the Far East.</TE>
<TE>   "We didn't know where exactly, but we thought it could be the
Philippines. We know there are terrorist activities in that part of the
world," his father said.</TE>
<TE>   It wasn't until Christmas morning, when their son called by satellite
telephone, that they began to suspect he was likely in a place far more
dangerous.</TE>
<TE>   "During the conversation, he let it slip what time zone he was in, the
time of day it was," Chapman said. "We were able to deduce he was in
Afghanistan, or close to it. We still didn't know for sure until the
chaplain came yesterday to confirm his death."</TE>
<TE>   "He seemed so far away," his mother, Lynn, recalled tearfully. "But I
was glad that he was able to talk to us. . . . He had been through so
many things, so many actions. And I guess I came to think that nothing
would happen to him. I was wrong," she said, her voice breaking.</TE>
<TE>   "We're very sorry to lose Nathan," she said. "But we're also very
proud of him. He was a wonderful man, a wonderful child. And we're proud
that he was doing a good thing for our country."</TE>

<HD>Bush Says He Won't Budge on Tax Cuts</HD>
<DH>Policy: In California, the president responds heatedly to
Democratic criticism of his fiscal plan, as government focus shifts to
domestic issues.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>EDWIN CHEN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In an opening round of election-year rhetoric, a spirited President
Bush vowed Saturday that his signature $1.35-trillion, 10-year tax cut
would be repealed only "over my dead body," accusing Democrats of wanting
to raise taxes.</LD>
<LD>   "I challenge their economics when they say raising taxes will help the
country recover," the president said defiantly at a town hall meeting
here, with about 5,000 enthusiastic Southern Californians repeatedly
interrupting his remarks with applause.</LD>
<LD>   Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle (D-S.D.) immediately fired back,
issuing a statement in Washington: "No amount of hot rhetoric will get
the economy back on track."</LD>
<TE>   Daschle also said that it was "undeniable that the Republicans turned
record surpluses into deficits in the space of just one year. It is time
they explain to the American people what they intend to do about the hole
they dug."</TE>
<TE>   The high-decibel exchange between the leaders of the two major
political parties signaled a reemergence of domestic issues--specifically
over how to deal with the economic recession--as control of both houses
of Congress hangs in the balance in November's elections.</TE>
<TE>   Bush's comments were in response to a speech Friday by Daschle, who
said the across-the-board tax cut "probably made the recession worse."</TE>
<TE>   But Daschle did not call for its repeal, as Bush implied Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   "Let me be clear," Daschle responded Saturday, "I proposed short-term
tax cuts to create jobs and generate investment and long-term fiscal
discipline, not tax increases."</TE>
<TE>   Despite his confrontational tone, Bush called for the kind of
conciliation at home that has prevailed in the war on terrorism abroad.</TE>
<TE>   "We have responded to the issues abroad with unanimity and clarity of
purpose and resolve," the president said. "It's time to take this spirit
of unanimity . . . and bring it to Washington, D.C."</TE>
<TE>   Much of Bush's opening statement consisted of a progress report on the
war against Osama bin Laden, his Al Qaeda terrorist network and the
erstwhile ruling Taliban. The president won rousing support time and
again for his now-familiar resolve and bellicose language directed at the
"evil-doers."</TE>
<TE>   During a brief question-and-answer period, Bush criticized the
Immigration and Naturalization Service for being "too bureaucratic" and
said he intends to "streamline it and make it work." He did not
elaborate.</TE>
<TE>   Well aware that the Ontario audience was disproportionately made up of
Latinos, the president emerged during "Hail to the Chief" and let loose a
burst of Spanish phrases that delighted many in the audience--and
prompted several to speak back to him in Spanish later as they posed
questions to him.</TE>
<TE>   White House aides said Ontario was chosen for the town hall meeting in
part because it anchors the Inland Empire, which voted for Bush last year
in larger numbers than any other region of California. And perhaps
equally convenient, many polls show that a higher percentage of Latinos
back the president's prosecution of the war than any other ethnic group.</TE>
<TE>   Those two factors clearly contributed Saturday to the adulation
showered upon Bush. The crowd's repeated applause were reminiscent of
that accorded a president during a State of the Union address.</TE>
<TE>   Since Christmas, Bush has spent most of his days on his 1,600-acre
ranch near Crawford, Texas. That respite clearly has rejuvenated Bush and
put him in a good humor.</TE>
<TE>   When a Latina entrepreneur declared her desire to design a dress for
First Lady Laura Bush, the president answered: "You've got a very good
marketing department, I see that!"</TE>
<TE>   Just before leaving Ontario for Portland, Ore., Bush met briefly with
California Gov. Gray Davis in the presidential limousine. All three
candidates for the Republican gubernatorial nomination attended the town
hall meeting, as did several members of Congress from Southern
California. But they all were kept far from Bush in public.</TE>
<TE>   "He's a nonpartisan president during these times," explained former
Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan, who said the White House wanted to
avoid any hint of partisan politics during Bush's brief stop here.</TE>
<TE>   On the war front, Bush without prompting launched into a defense of
the crackdown against suspected terrorists in the United States, which
has been questioned by some civil libertarians.</TE>
<TE>   "We respect people's constitutional rights, and we will continue to do
so," Bush said. "But if we think somebody is fixing to hurt the American
people, we will move in this country."</TE>
<TE>   He characterized the counter-terrorism campaign as "a clear case of
good versus evil--and make no mistake about it: Good will prevail."</TE>
<TE>   In a sneak preview of his first State of the Union address, scheduled
for Jan. 29 before a joint session of Congress, Bush said he will "make
sure that the defense of this nation is the No. 1 priority of the budget
of the United States."</TE>
<TE>   He spoke so animatedly, first about the war and then the economy, that
he left little time for questions and answers.</TE>
<TE>   One of the morning's strongest ovations came when Bush appealed to
Democrats for unanimity on domestic issues, although it was far from
clear that the response represented an endorsement of Bush's agenda.</TE>
<TE>   "The terrorists not only attacked our freedom but they also attacked
our economy, and we need to respond in unison," the president said. "I
stand here before you as a proud party man. But let me tell you
something, the country is far more important."</TE>
<TE>   Bush said the growing debate over how to fight the recession "is
troubling me," both because of the political rancor and the specific
Democratic criticisms of the 10-year tax cut. "I don't know what economic
textbook they're reading," Bush fumed with mock anger.</TE>
<TE>   Bush's unequivocal promise to fight any attempt to repeal the tax cut
was reminiscent of the "Read my lips: No new taxes" pledge made in 1988
by his father, former President Bush. The elder Bush later abandoned that
pledge, angering many Republicans and playing a role in the 41st
president's reelection defeat in 1992.</TE>
<TE>   In his weekly Saturday radio address, the president urged the Senate
to pass his bill to stimulate the economy. The measure was passed by the
Republican-dominated House but has stalled in the Democrat-controlled
Senate.</TE>
<TE>   Bush noted pointedly that he had proposed the bill Oct. 4, "three
months and 943,000 lost jobs ago."</TE>
<TE>   In Portland, Bush toured a job training center and then spoke at a
high school, echoing the themes he touched on in California.</TE>
<TE>   Oregon, which was one of the most closely contested states in the
disputed 2000 presidential election, has a 7.4% joblessness rate, the
highest in the nation.</TE>
<TE>   At Parkrose High School in Portland, Bush told several thousand
people: "My greatest hope for 2002 is that people who want to work can
find a job."</TE>
<TE>   The president also toured the Northeast Portland One-Stop Career
Center, where he said: "There are some people that are worried about
their unemployment benefits; they're worried about health care payments.
Congress needs to focus on what can get done . . . [and] to stop playing
politics."</TE>

<HD>American Jews Face East-West Power Struggle</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TERESA WATANABE</AU>
<BD>TIMES RELIGION WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The abrupt dismissal of the Anti-Defamation League's regional
director here has illuminated the growing power struggles between East
and West Coast Jewry, as the fulcrum of influence over American Jewish
life shifts from its historical center in New York.</LD>
<LD>   David Lehrer, the regional director who helped knit together Los
Angeles' disparate communities during 27 years of wide-ranging human
relations work, was dismissed from his post Dec. 21 by National Director
Abraham Foxman in New York.</LD>
<LD>   His ouster astonished and outraged Jewish community members here, who
said Lehrer had never received a negative performance review, had tripled
the league's fund-raising revenue and had forged broad community ties in
initiating scores of programs to fight bigotry and stereotyping.</LD>
<TE>   Foxman has not publicly commented on his actions, and an ADL
spokesperson in New York said he was on vacation and unavailable for an
interview last week. Other East Coast Jewish leaders could not be reached
for comment.</TE>
<TE>   Sources within the ADL and other observers of Jewish affairs, however,
said about 40 members of the league's Los Angeles lay leadership
overwhelmingly expressed support for Lehrer in a tense conference call
last week with Glen Tobias, the ADL's national chairman. These observers
said Tobias refused to explain Foxman's actions, calling it a personnel
matter.</TE>
<TE>   Lehrer, who has run the ADL's Pacific Southwest office for 16 years,
said he has met with attorneys and is exploring legal options.</TE>
<TE>   Among some Jews here, the brouhaha has reignited long-simmering
resentment over the way national Jewish organizations in New York still
treat Los Angeles as "a colony," as one put it. The same kind of
tension--often between national headquarters and regional offices--has
surfaced in other American Jewish organizations in recent years.</TE>
<TE>   Lehrer would say only that "my ouster is in part a reflection of the
East-West divide in American Jewry. I hope the Los Angeles Jewish
community continues to assert its independence and uniqueness."</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles is the nation's second-largest Jewish enclave, 600,000
people ranging from powerful Hollywood moguls to cutting-edge rabbis to a
vibrant influx of immigrants from Iran, Russia and elsewhere.</TE>
<TE>   A long-term demographic shift is reshaping America's Jewish
population, pulling more Jews to the Sun Belt and West Coast. Yet the
Northeast--still home to more than 40% of the nation's 6 million Jews,
according to demographer Pini Herman--has been slow to share the power,
officials here say. According to the Jewish Journal, a Los Angeles-based
community weekly newspaper, 75% of the 54 members of the Conference of
Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations live in the Northeast.
The paper quoted conference official Malcolm Hoenlein as dismissing any
prejudice against the West Coast.</TE>
<TE>   But a West Coast Jewish leader disputes that. "There's a lot of
creative power going on in L.A. that is now shifting the fulcrum of
influence on Jewish affairs to be shared by both coasts, and traditional
organizations like the ADL don't like it," said Rabbi John Rosove, a
league board member and senior rabbi at Temple Israel of Hollywood. "They
want to maintain power to determine the agenda for themselves."</TE>
<TE>   Rosove recalled that when he was ordained at Hebrew Union College in
New York in 1979, he was advised against taking a post in San Francisco
because "no one will take you seriously and you'll never come back East."
He said that attitude has begun to change, but not quickly enough.</TE>
<TE>   The rabbi said he planned to resign from the ADL's local board unless
unspecified "amends" were made to Lehrer by Foxman. Other Lehrer
partisans have called for Foxman to apologize, offer a financial
settlement and review personnel decisions at the ADL.</TE>
<TE>   Those familiar with the long-standing tension between the two men said
it was driven by what they called Foxman's autocratic style and Lehrer's
refusal to be intimidated by it. The most-often-cited example was the
national ADL's opposition to Los Angeles Muslim leader Salam Al-Marayati
as a member of a national counter-terrorist commission. Lehrer was known
to support Al-Marayati.</TE>
<TE>Key Issue Is Power and How to Share It</TE>
<TE>   Foxman most recently came under fire for one-man decision-making from
both league members and the broader Jewish community after he promoted a
presidential pardon for fugitive Marc Rich--an action Foxman later said
he regretted. Some sources spoke on the condition of anonymity because of
fear of retribution by the national office.</TE>
<TE>   Gerald Bubis, a Los Angeles expert on Jewish agencies, said the key
issue was power and how to share it. He said institutional tension
between responsibility and authority--the mandate to raise money but no
say in how to spend it--has bedeviled organizations in general, including
the Red Cross and United Way.</TE>
<TE>   At the ADL, Los Angeles provided 10% of the national budget, ranking
first in fund-raising (including financial pledges in wills and other
forms of deferred giving). But all budget decisions were made in New
York.</TE>
<TE>   Two years ago, the same kind of disconnect surfaced in the American
Jewish Congress when the organization's Los Angeles office broke off and
formed a separate organization, the Progressive Jewish Alliance. Alliance
President Douglas Mirell said the reason was less geographical than
ideological: The Los Angeles office, he said, was distressed by what it
perceived as a swing to the right by national leaders.</TE>
<TE>A Growing Divide Over Liberal Agenda</TE>
<TE>   Mirell said a new crop of national leaders was weakening the
organization's long-standing liberal agenda. In the mid-1990s, he said,
they began withdrawing support for the Mideast peace process. Then, in a
move that sparked the break, American Jewish Congress leaders criticized
a groundbreaking report by the group's Los Angeles office that pointed
out Jewish involvement in Southern California's sweatshop industry.</TE>
<TE>   Local defections have continued, with the Boston office of the
American Jewish Congress recently breaking off after the national
headquarters failed to protest the appointment of Atty. Gen. John
Ashcroft or President Bush's anti-terrorism measures, including plans for
secret military tribunals, Mirell said.</TE>
<TE>   Daniel J. Sokatch, executive director of the Progressive Jewish
Alliance, said the developments underscored a growing divide between Jews
dedicated to a traditional agenda of Holocaust remembrance, fighting
anti-Semitism and support of Israel, and those fired by broader ideals of
social justice.</TE>
<TE>   The Los Angeles alliance, Sokatch said, has pulled in scores of
younger Jews who had not previously been affiliated with any organization
by promoting a liberal agenda based on the biblical exhortation,
"Justice, justice shall you pursue," and the Jewish concept of tikkun
olam, or repair the world. He said the alliance is working against the
death penalty and abuses in the sweatshop industry, for instance, and
remains a stalwart member of the Muslim-Jewish dialogue in Los Angeles,
which has suffered defections by members of both sides.</TE>
<TE>   "With traditional organizations, there is a sense that you should be
guilted into affiliation," Sokatch said. "That's no way to ensure Jewish
continuity. You should identify as a Jew because you come from a great
and beautiful prophetic tradition of social justice and tikkun olam. This
is a much more joyful and ultimately productive way to be a Jew."</TE>
<TE>   Less testy but also significant, the University of Judaism became
autonomous from the Jewish Theological Seminary in New York in 1994 when
it opened its own rabbinical school. According to Rabbi Elliot Dorff, a
philosophy professor there, the move created some consternation in New
York, which until then had a monopoly on training rabbis for the
Conservative movement.</TE>
<TE>   Dorff said the move in part symbolized "the West Coast Jewish
community growing up," and underscored differences between Los Angeles
and New York in their approach to rabbinical education. He said the
seminary approach was more formal and cerebral, which did not address a
desire in Los Angeles to offer students training in how to make the
Talmud relevant to people's daily religious lives.</TE>
<TE>   As one example, Dorff said he expands teachings of ancient Jewish laws
on personal injury, for instance, to include discussions of suicide, drug
abuse and other contemporary issues. He also said student-faculty
relations are more personal here.</TE>
<TE>   "We're a California institution--not exactly touchy-feely, but there
is a presumption here that students and faculty will talk about both
academic and nonacademic things," Dorff said.</TE>
<TE>Some Groups Avoid Bicoastal Tensions</TE>
<TE>   Some Jewish organizations have managed to avoid the bicoastal
tensions. Bruce Ramer, a prominent entertainment attorney in Los Angeles,
recently headed the American Jewish Committee; local Executive Director
Gary Greenebaum said the organization has experienced normal "stresses
and strains" between coasts but no major differences in priorities.</TE>
<TE>   In the Reform movement, the new president of Hebrew Union
College-Jewish Institute of Religion, Rabbi David Ellenson, is an
Angeleno. Two of the past three presidents of the Central Conference of
American Rabbis have been from the West Coast, and the next president
slated to head the Reform rabbinical group is a Bay Area woman rabbi.</TE>
<TE>   The demographic shift to the South and West is "just now coming into
ascendancy in an organizational way," said Rabbi Alan Henkin, regional
director of the Pacific Southwest Council of the Union of American Hebrew
Congregations.</TE>

<LD>"More Fast and Furious" is more than just a new CD soundtrack from
a hit movie. It's also a harbinger of things to come--an indication that
technology may soon trump the law and change the way consumers listen to
music, watch movies and read books.</LD>
<LD>   The ordinary-looking disc of heart-pounding music works just like any
other CD in a home stereo or boom box. Put it in the slot, it plays. And
while it plays, it can be recorded on tape.</LD>
<LD>   But the disc also has hidden electronic locks that go to work when
it's placed in a computer. Most PCs come equipped with jukebox programs
that can copy CDs as well as play them, eliminating the need for tape
recorders. The locks on "More Fast and Furious" are designed to confound
those programs, keeping the PC from copying the disc and, in some cases,
even playing it.</LD>
<TE>   The goal of the new CD technology is to turn back the clock on digital
recording, which the record companies say is fueling piracy and hurting
sales. The software restricts copying to time-consuming analog recorders
instead of speedy digital tools that make perfect duplicates.</TE>
<TE>   For years, critics have warned that movie studios, publishers and
record labels would someday use digitized media to enforce restrictions
that the courts refuse to impose, limiting what consumers could do with
film, print and music.</TE>
<TE>   "More Fast and Furious," from Universal Music Group, the world's
largest record company, underscores how near that day is.</TE>
<TE>   Publishers already sell electronic books with technology that prevents
buyers from lending the text to a friend or copying excerpts for a school
paper. And record companies have introduced digital song files that can
only be played on the computer that downloaded them.</TE>
<TE>   Eventually, intellectual property activists say, such technology could
make it impossible to present a digital movie as a gift because the movie
would play only on the machine owned by the person who paid for the item.
Likewise, television shows would be broadcast in formats that prevented
them from being recorded.</TE>
<TE>   "The copyright holders want to sell you something but still get to
control what you do with it," said Cindy Cohn, legal director of the
Electronic Frontier Foundation, which battles for civil rights in
cyberspace. "If they're allowed to do that, if we throw the traditional
interpretation of intellectual property protection out the window, there
will come a time when our entire culture will be rented to us by the
hour, or the day, or whatever the copyright owner decides."</TE>
<TE>   Entertainment industry executives say the new technologies are needed
to prevent the world from being flooded with pirate copies of their most
popular works. The technologies are also critical to protecting
established business models, such as the movie industry's staggered
releases to theaters, video stores, cable TV and broadcasters.</TE>
<TE>Digital Era Makes Piracy Much Easier</TE>
<TE>   "Unless you recover your costs, there's no way you can make a new
motion picture," said Jared Jussim, executive vice president in the
intellectual property department of Sony Pictures Entertainment Inc.
"It's as simple as that."</TE>
<TE>   The debate itself is not new. There has always been tension between
those who produce copyrighted works and those who use them. The holders
of music copyrights fought the advent of the player piano. Movie studios
went to court against video cassette recorders.</TE>
<TE>   But the digital era makes wholesale piracy much easier. Perfect copies
can be duplicated quickly and distributed widely with relatively simple
tools. At the same time, producers of copyrighted works can use digital
technology to truly control how their content is used.</TE>
<TE>   Some scholars and lawmakers argue that measures like Universal's
copy-protected CD go too far. What distinguishes "More Fast and Furious"
is that it represents the first commercial release in the U.S. of a
copy-protected CD by a major record label. Previously secure CDs have
been released in the U.S. by major labels on a test basis only.</TE>
<TE>   "I think this is uncalled for and unnecessary as a means of protecting
legitimate copyright interests," said Rep. Rick Boucher (D-Va).</TE>
<TE>   He predicted that Congress would be forced to take action. "When
millions of Americans are frustrated in their desire to do something
that's entirely lawful, normally members of Congress hear about it," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   In a sense, Universal's music division is just following the lead of
its movie studio brethren. Movies on DVD have always been protected by
electronic locks, and prerecorded VHS tapes have long come equipped with
anti-copying technology.</TE>
<TE>   On the other hand, music fans have been making copies of albums and
singles for decades, and CDs and computers have made the process easier
than ever.</TE>
<TE>   Millions of consumers use their computers to convert the songs on
their CDs into compressed digital files, such as MP3s, that can be played
in any order, transferred to a pocket-sized portable device or mixed and
rerecorded onto custom CDs.</TE>
<TE>   The problem for record companies is that many consumers have been
copying more than just their own CDs. Free file-sharing services from the
likes of Napster Inc., which let any user grab MP3 files from other
users' computers, showed that the new digital copying tools facilitated
piracy on an unprecedented scale.</TE>
<TE>   Federal law gives copyright owners the exclusive right to copy and
publicly perform their works, but it also allows the public to make "fair
use" of those works. Copyright was designed to give people an economic
incentive to create new works, but the courts recognized that absolute
copyright is a kind of monopoly on information.</TE>
<TE>   Citing the 1st Amendment, judges carved out the first "fair-use"
exemptions so copyright holders could not, for example, keep a newspaper
from quoting a sentence in a book, said Pamela Samuelson, a law professor
at UC Berkeley.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. Supreme Court relied on the fair-use doctrine in 1984 when it
said consumers weren't breaking the law by taping television programs on
their VCRs. Other types of home copying, such as making a tape for the
car stereo from a purchased CD or copying songs to an MP3 player, have
received similar protection from the legal system.</TE>
<TE>Balancing Fair Use, Copyright Protection</TE>
<TE>   Some lawmakers and copyright holders say "fair use" should be
implemented in a new way now that digital technologies have transformed
copying.</TE>
<TE>   With VCRs and other analog recorders, "there was still a major cost to
the consumer to violate the copyright laws beyond mere fair use," Rep.
Robert Goodlatte (R-Va.) said in an interview earlier this year. But
digital technologies and the Internet eliminate the cost of piracy,
upsetting the balance between allowing fair use and protecting
copyrights.</TE>
<TE>   Cary Sherman, general counsel for the Recording Industry Assn. of
America, said copyright law doesn't give consumers carte blanche to make
copies of the music they buy for personal use, although it is hard to say
what the limit on personal copies should be.</TE>
<TE>   "Companies are modifying their licensing practices to try to achieve
some balance" between protection and personal-use copying, Sherman said.
"But ultimately, it's the copyright owner's choice."</TE>
<TE>   But Rep. Boucher disagreed, saying that is exactly what the law
prohibits. Fair use is not an option to be restricted at the copyright
holder's whim, he said, but protected activity sheltered by a century of
judicial oversight.</TE>
<TE>   Lawrence Lessig, a law professor at Stanford University and an expert
on technology and intellectual property, went further, saying: "Copyright
law was designed to give copyright owners an extremely limited set of
rights that could only be exercised for a limited time. And it certainly
wasn't designed to let copyright owners get to control perfectly how
their stuff gets used."</TE>
<TE>   Copyright holders are using technology not just to rein in fair use,
but also to evade the "first-sale" doctrine. That principle, which is
part of federal copyright law, gives anyone who buys a copyrighted work
the freedom to give away, lend, rent or sell it.</TE>
<TE>   For example, those who buy an electronic book can't transfer or sell
the file after they're done reading it. The same is true for a CD single
downloaded from an online record store, or a movie file downloaded from
an Internet video supplier.</TE>
<TE>   These items often cost just as much as their paper or plastic
counterparts. Publishers, record companies and Hollywood studios counter
that they are not selling their works but merely selling a license to
read or play them. And "first sale," they say, doesn't apply to a
license.</TE>
<TE>   "More Fast and Furious" comes with a sticker warning consumers that
the disc is copy-protected and may not play on some computers, DVD
players and game consoles. Consumers with Windows PCs can still make
analog copies of the songs on their computers, but the process takes more
time and delivers poorer quality than digital copying.</TE>
<TE>Issue Seen as Deeper Than Copying Music</TE>
<TE>   Some music industry analysts and others predict a consumer backlash if
record companies make a wholesale switch to secure CDs. The companies
supplying copy-protection technology, however, say that they've done
tests with millions of unmarked secure CDs and that consumers returned
only a tiny percentage of them.</TE>
<TE>   Samuelson warned, though, that the issue goes deeper than just copying
music.</TE>
<TE>   "Copyright exists to promote progress, not to create an absolute
monopoly on intellectual property," she said. "Eliminating concepts like
fair use through technology destroys this zone that lets us make private
use of information, damaging critical commentary, political activism and
journalism."</TE>

<HD>U.S. Air Bases Forge Double-Edged Sword</HD>
<DH>Deployment: Presence in nine countries ringing Afghanistan enhances
capability but also fuels Islamic extremism.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>WILLIAM M. ARKIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>Behind a veil of secret agreements, the United States is creating a
ring of new and expanded military bases that encircle Afghanistan and
enhance the armed forces' ability to strike targets throughout much of
the Muslim world.</LD>
<LD>   Since Sept. 11, according to Pentagon sources, military tent cities
have sprung up at 13 locations in nine countries neighboring Afghanistan,
substantially extending the network of bases in the region. All together,
from Bulgaria and Uzbekistan to Turkey, Kuwait and beyond, more than
60,000 U.S. military personnel now live and work at these forward bases.
Hundreds of aircraft fly in and out of so-called "expeditionary
airfields."</LD>
<LD>   While these bases make it easier for the United States to project its
power, they may also increase prospects for renewed terrorist attacks on
Americans.</LD>
<TE>   The new buildup is occurring with almost no public discussion. Indeed,
it has passed virtually unnoticed outside the region--in part because of
operational security and force protection considerations in Afghanistan
and in part because of agreements between Washington and host governments
not to discuss the bases in public.</TE>
<TE>   But the reasoning behind these agreements underscores the risk: Though
Washington has obtained the support of the ruling regimes, including some
inside the former Soviet Union, virtually all the bases are in countries
where an American military presence stirs resentment among Islamic
extremists.</TE>
<TE>   "I swear to God that America will not live in peace before all the
army of infidels depart the land of the prophet Muhammad," Osama bin
Laden said in his first video recording released after Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. policymakers have tended to dismiss such statements as
propaganda, but some analysts think they reflect widespread Muslim
sensitivities that the United States has been slow to appreciate.</TE>
<TE>   In the view not only of Bin Laden but also of many Islamic
sympathizers, the continued presence of American forces in Saudi Arabia
and other Arab states after the end of the Persian Gulf War in 1991
constituted "defilement" of Muslim holy places.</TE>
<TE>   Without accepting this view as a justification for terrorism, some
analysts believe U.S. officials underestimate the impact that prolonged
stationing of American forces may have in the Muslim world--especially
since it is highly visible there, though it has attracted little
attention in the West. The Arab press in particular is filled with
speculation and conspiracy theories about the ultimate purpose of the
U.S. presence.</TE>
<TE>   Many see it as evidence of an American desire for hegemony and
control.</TE>
<TE>   "The old basing structure, honed to fight the Soviet Union," is gone,
says defense analyst James Blaker, author of a seminal Pentagon study of
overseas bases. "But does the new one open us up to counteractions?"</TE>
<TE>   The American buildup in the region began long before Sept. 11, and it
has been paralleled by a shift in the focus of terrorist groups.</TE>
<TE>   As the United States built a network of facilities in a half-dozen
Persian Gulf states after the Gulf War, terrorism increasingly focused on
large U.S. targets, from the bombing of the Khobar Towers in Saudi Arabia
and the destroyer Cole in Yemen to the attacks on the Pentagon and the
World Trade Center.</TE>
<TE>   In the words of novelist John le Carre, who has studied the Muslim
world extensively and set some of his stories there, "What America longs
for at this moment, even above retribution, is more friends and fewer
enemies."</TE>
<TE>   Instead, "what America is storing up for herself is yet more enemies,"
he said in an essay that appeared in the Toronto Globe and Mail. "Because
after all the bribes, threats and promises that have patched together
this rickety coalition, we cannot prevent another suicide bomber being
born--and nobody can tell us how to dodge this devil's cycle of despair,
hatred and, yet again, revenge."</TE>
<TE>   Since the end of the Cold War, the U.S. military presence overseas has
changed profoundly. A 1999 Army War College study found, "While permanent
overseas presence has decreased dramatically, operational deployments
have increased exponentially."</TE>
<TE>   The Pentagon pulled out of 700 facilities in Europe and abandoned the
containment ring of bases around the old Soviet Union. In sheer numbers,
it reduced the overseas presence to about 60% of what it was when Ronald
Reagan took office.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the numerical reduction took place in Germany, as forces were
demobilized and the military shrank its Cold War size there by fully
two-thirds.</TE>
<TE>   The far more significant change, however, came in the way troops were
used abroad. In earlier times, members of the armed forces were routinely
"stationed" overseas, usually for tours of several years and often
accompanied by their families. Now they are "deployed," with the length
of tour more uncertain and dependents almost never allowed.</TE>
<TE>   The deployments are both frequent and lengthy, however. On any given
day before Sept. 11, according to the Defense Department, more than
60,000 military personnel were conducting temporary operations and
exercises in about 100 countries.</TE>
<TE>   While the mammoth European installations have been cut back, Defense
Department records show that the new operational mode calls military
personnel away from home about 135 days a year for the Army, 170 days for
the Navy and 176 days for the Air Force.</TE>
<TE>   For the Army, each soldier now averages a deployment abroad once every
14 weeks.</TE>
<TE>   Beyond the burdens it places on those involved, the new system draws
the military into situations that are murkier and potentially riskier.
Consider the case of Master Sgt. Evander Earl Andrews, the first American
casualty of Operation Enduring Freedom. Andrews, an 18-year Air Force
veteran, died in a construction accident. He was one of more than 2,000
civil engineers currently deployed in the region building and fixing up
bases.</TE>
<TE>   The Defense Department initially said Andrews was at a "forward
deployed location" supporting the Afghanistan war. Eventually, it
divulged that the location was Al Adid in the tiny state of Qatar on the
Arabian Peninsula.</TE>
<TE>   Al Adid is a billion-dollar base. Its 15,000-foot runway is one of the
longest in the Gulf region. Construction began after an April 2000 visit
by Defense Secretary William S. Cohen. Qatar already housed equipment for
an Army brigade and, in 1996, hosted 30 Air Force fighters on an
"expeditionary" deployment.</TE>
<TE>   Though the original justification for Gulf bases such as Al Adid was
preparedness for renewed action against Iraq, a senior defense official
said last year that the Qatar facilities were "not focused at one
particular country or another, but part of a system we would like to have
in place."</TE>
<TE>   Issues of decision-making, jurisdiction and authority held by the host
country are spelled out in documents called status of forces agreements.
As of Sept. 11, according to Pentagon documents, the United States had
formal agreements of this sort with Qatar and 92 other countries.</TE>
<TE>   During the Cold War, the agreements were usually public documents.
Many of the newer ones are classified, including those with Kuwait, Oman
and the United Arab Emirates as well as certain supplements for Saudi
Arabia. "Host nation sensitivities" require that the arrangements be
secret, officials say.</TE>
<TE>   To lower the U.S. military profile further, in most Gulf countries,
permanent U.S. military and contractor personnel nominally work for
organizations with innocuous-sounding names like the "Executive
Coordinating Agency."</TE>
<TE>   That may blur the picture for Americans, but not for the local
population. On Nov. 7, an attacker was shot and killed after exchanging
gunfire with two U.S. military and one Qatari guard at Al Adid.</TE>
<TE>   Since Sept. 11, new classified arrangements have also been established
with Kyrgyzstan, Pakistan, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan, the four "stans,"
as they are sometimes called. The United States had no military
facilities or appreciable presence in these places before the World Trade
Center and Pentagon attacks.</TE>
<TE>   Typical is Uzbekistan, which very early on extended use of its
Kandabad air base at Karshi for military and CIA operations. Journalists
have descended on Uzbekistan since early October, but most report that
the obvious American presence is not much of an issue for public
discussion.</TE>
<TE>   In this former Soviet province, national security secrecy is a way of
life. The state-controlled press of President Islam Karimov has said the
base is a staging area for search-and-rescue missions and humanitarian
work in Afghanistan. The Pentagon sidesteps discussion of Uzbekistan's
human rights record or the implications of the U.S. presence, saying that
it leaves it to the host nation to describe its cooperation with the
United States.</TE>
<TE>   Central Command chief Tommy Franks and Defense Secretary Donald H.
Rumsfeld have been frequent visitors to the "stans." They are like the
hood ornaments on a big truck:</TE>
<TE>   In November a Central Command assessment team landed in Tajikistan to
examine three military installations as possible areas to base U.S.
troops: Kulyab, Khojand and Turgan-Tiube. Tajikistan is about 85% Muslim.</TE>
<TE>   Just prior to Christmas, engineers arrived at Manas airport in
Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan, to open the airfield for U.S. use. Facilities for up
to 3,300 personnel are being created. Kyrgyzstan also has a largely
Muslim population.</TE>
<TE>   How long will the United States remain? The answer, officials suggest
privately, recalls the old wartime song, "Over There." The song ended,
"And we won't be back till it's over over there."</TE>
<TE>   No one inside the Pentagon or at Central Command headquarters has a
timetable or master plan for when U.S. forces will withdraw, but it may
be instructive to recall that the Persian Gulf bases have now been
occupied for more than a decade. They were constantly upgraded and
improved during the 1990s, setting the stage for the current deployments.
The process went forward on a largely ad hoc basis, focused on practical
arrangements and conditions in each country.</TE>
<TE>   Then, as now, what seems to have been missing was a broad conceptual
view of what the whole effort might add up to, or what its more distant
implications might turn out to be.</TE>

<HD>As the Prices Rise, So Does Argentine Shoppers' Ire</HD>
<DH>Economics: In a nation bracing for a currency devaluation,
consumers find higher costs already are a reality. Reform bill advances
in Congress.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRIS KRAUL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>BUENOS AIRES
</DL>
<LD>Maria Soledad Lopez stormed out of a pharmacy in this city's
middle-class Caballito shopping district Saturday and fumed about an
overnight increase of 20% in the price of contraceptives.</LD>
<LD>   Like many Argentines this weekend, Lopez had received an unpleasant
glimpse of the economy to come in a country bracing for an imminent
currency devaluation of between 30% and 50%. Merchants have already
raised prices on a variety of goods, from drugs and cigars to chickens
and appliances.</LD>
<LD>   "I won't buy it if they're going to rob me," the 25-year-old Buenos
Aires law student said as she strode down the shopping district's
Rivadavia Street. "The devaluation isn't even here yet. It makes me
furious. They are raising their umbrellas before the rain has come."</LD>
<TE>   Other Argentines reacted similarly to widespread price hikes of as
much as 30%--a special shock to a country that, despite myriad other
economic problems, at least has seen minimal inflation during the last
decade. The cost of living actually declined 2% in 2001 while the country
endured its fourth year of recession.</TE>
<TE>   "We are very afraid of inflation. We lived through that in the 1980s,
and it was a disaster," importer Mariana Hernandez said as she shopped
with her husband and infant in the upscale Patio Bullrich mall in the
Recoleta section of town.</TE>
<TE>   Eduardo Duhalde, who on Wednesday became Argentina's fifth president
in two weeks, said Friday that a devaluation of the currency, the peso,
is a "given" and that the country will abandon an economic model that has
left it "bankrupt and exhausted." In the short term, however, devaluation
will probably lead to high inflation, rising unemployment and a deeper
recession.</TE>
<TE>   Late Saturday, the Chamber of Deputies, the lower house of Congress,
approved Duhalde's sweeping economic reform package. It includes a
devaluation, budget cuts and a special measure to convert
dollar-denominated obligations of up to $100,000 to pesos as a means of
softening the devaluation blow.</TE>
<TE>   The legislation also aims to reform the banking system, control prices
and protect industry and jobs. Government officials have indicated that
they expect a rate of about 1.4 pesos to the dollar for finance and
business transactions, with individuals probably paying more to buy
currency on the open market.</TE>
<TE>Package Goes to Senate</TE>
<TE>   The bill is to be submitted today to the Senate, where approval is
virtually assured. Duhalde's Peronist party dominates both houses of
Congress.</TE>
<TE>   For consumers prowling the stores and malls Saturday, devaluation was
already a fact of life.</TE>
<TE>   On Friday, the giant Fravega appliance chain had raised prices 12% to
15% on its washing machines, televisions and other items, a store manager
said. Supermarkets had re-tagged imported meats, bananas and olive oil to
reflect the peso's anticipated drop in value.</TE>
<TE>   Electronics merchant Alicia Nadeshula has raised prices of her
Asian-produced video games, telephones and hand-held computers by 10% to
15%.</TE>
<TE>   "Almost everything you see here is imported. What else can we do?"
said Nadeshula, whose store is in the Caballito district in the heart of
the capital. "We sacrifice for 10 years, and in one day the politicians
destroy everything. I hope to leave this country. I can't tolerate it
anymore."</TE>
<TE>   The price increases have darkened the already abysmal mood of
Argentines.</TE>
<TE>   Retailers, including the pharmacy that enraged Lopez, say they are
only passing along higher costs that wholesalers and manufacturers have
slapped on them.</TE>
<TE>   "The great majority of drugs we sell are imported or are made from
imported substances, which now cost more," said Carlos Caponi, owner of
the Subeldia Pharmacy on Rivadavia Street.</TE>
<TE>   Caponi denied that his drugstore had increased prices, saying that it
had simply discontinued its policy of offering 20% discounts on most
products.</TE>
<TE>   "It's the same game that supermarkets play," he said.</TE>
<TE>Shops Absorbing Costs</TE>
<TE>   Not all merchants are raising prices--yet. Some say the economy is so
bad that they must absorb the higher wholesale costs or lose what little
business they have.</TE>
<TE>   "In this recession, people aren't buying now, not only because they
don't have money but because they are afraid," said Ana Bircz, owner of
Games and Toys in the Caballito shopping district. She said her Christmas
sales were down by half from the previous year's.</TE>
<TE>   Uncertainty about what the government will do makes the current
business climate "worse than the hyperinflation" of the 1980s, said
Silvana Essels, a saleswoman at the Chocolate women's apparel shop in the
Recoleta zone. "You don't know how it's going to end."</TE>
<TE>   "Our economy has been open to the world for 10 years, and now they may
close the frontiers, talking about protectionism and devaluation. I don't
like those two words," importer Hernandez said.</TE>
<TE>   Duhalde used the word "protectionism" in a Friday speech but said he
meant it as a new approach in encouraging Argentines to buy more domestic
goods.</TE>
<TE>   Much of Argentine business has slowed to a crawl since Dec. 3, when
the government imposed a $250 weekly limit on savings deposit
withdrawals. That has caused a steep drop in the level of cash in
circulation, which has especially hurt retail businesses dealing in
nonessential goods, such as newsstands, coffee shops and sporting goods
stores. They can't afford to raise prices.</TE>
<TE>   "Here it is summer vacation, and we can't even sell a bathing suit,"
said Jose Sanchez, a salesman at the Liceo Deporte sporting goods shop,
adding that business there had come to a halt since Dec. 3. "The things
we could sell--imported Puma or Adidas athletic shoes--we can't get
because wholesalers are keeping them off the market, waiting to see how
the devaluation is defined."</TE>
<TE>   The Coffee Store in the Recoleta zone has lost half its business in
the last three months. Sales dived after the bank withdrawal limit was
declared.</TE>
<TE>   Asked to predict how a devaluation would affect her business, waitress
Julieta Sepich said: "In this country, nothing would surprise me. We are
cured of shock."</TE>

<HD>India Calls for Action, Not Just Gestures</HD>
<DH>South Asia: Its prime minister acquiesces to a handshake initiated
by Pakistan's leader but repeats his demand for an end to terrorism.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PAUL WATSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>KATMANDU, Nepal
</DL>
<LD>Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf stole the stage at a regional
summit here Saturday with a surprise shake of Indian Prime Minister Atal
Behari Vajpayee's hand, but the gesture drew only stern words from
Vajpayee.</LD>
<LD>   "I am glad that President Musharraf extended his hand of friendship to
me, and I have shaken his hand in your presence," Vajpayee told the
conference of seven South Asian nations.</LD>
<LD>   "Now President Musharraf must follow this gesture by not permitting
any activity in Pakistan, or any territory in its control today, which
enables terrorists to perpetrate mindless violence in India."</LD>
<TE>   Later Saturday, the Indian prime minister failed to show up at an
informal gathering of the leaders attending the South Asian Assn. of
Regional Cooperation summit, the first such conference in more than three
years.</TE>
<TE>   Musharraf has won praise from Western governments and the United
Nations for moving against alleged terrorists in Pakistan by arresting
hundreds of suspected extremists, including the leaders of two groups
that India blames for a Dec. 13 attack on its Parliament.</TE>
<TE>   India questions, however, whether the roundup of suspects will lead to
the trial and imprisonment of terrorists who it claims are secretly
supported by Pakistan's military intelligence.</TE>
<TE>   India's Foreign Ministry has repeatedly said it wants stronger
evidence that Musharraf is dismantling terrorist groups, such as a
decline in "terrorist" violence in the disputed Himalayan region of
Kashmir, before it will begin talks to defuse tensions with Pakistan.</TE>
<TE>   The Pakistani president drew loud applause when, at the close of his
speech Saturday, he announced that he wanted "to extend a hand of
genuine, sincere friendship to Prime Minister Vajpayee."</TE>
<TE>   When Musharraf walked in front of a row of leaders to shake Vajpayee's
hand, the Indian prime minister looked at first slightly perturbed and
then amused as a broad smile spread across his face. The Indian Foreign
Ministry later dismissed Musharraf's gesture as a public relations ploy.</TE>
<TE>   Saturday wasn't the first time that Indian officials have found
themselves outmaneuvered on television by Musharraf, an army general who
has proved much more adept at the media game than Vajpayee or his senior
ministers.</TE>
<TE>   When Vajpayee played host to Musharraf at a July summit near the Taj
Mahal, in the Indian city of Agra, the Pakistani leader revealed details
of the sensitive talks in a breakfast meeting with Indian editors, and a
videotape of his sometimes angry remarks was telecast almost immediately.</TE>
<TE>   Indian officials were incensed at what they considered a slap in the
face at a crucial moment in the Agra summit, and the meeting failed to
start a promised, step-by-step process to resolve the Kashmir dispute,
which has plagued relations between India and Pakistan since independence
in 1947.</TE>
<TE>   Musharraf repeated Saturday that Pakistan is "determined to eliminate
terrorism," but he then seemed to refer to a long-held position that
guerrillas fighting Indian rule in Kashmir are waging a justified
"freedom struggle."</TE>
<TE>   "We cannot address only the symptoms and leave the malaise aside,"
Musharraf said. "It is equally important that a distinction is maintained
between acts of legitimate resistance and freedom struggles on the one
hand and acts of terrorism on the other."</TE>
<TE>   India sees such remarks as a justification for what it considers
terrorism. But Musharraf's defense of one form of armed struggle in
Kashmir is only one reason Vajpayee doesn't trust the Pakistani leader's
promises to end terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   Vajpayee cited previous efforts at diplomacy with Pakistan that the
prime minister said "were rewarded with aggression."</TE>
<TE>   Vajpayee took a short bus ride across the border in February 1999 for
a summit with Pakistan's then-prime minister, Nawaz Sharif. The leaders
signed a joint declaration in which they promised to intensify efforts
toward resolving the Kashmir dispute and to "refrain from intervention
and interference in each other's internal affairs."</TE>
<TE>   About three months later, the two countries were on the brink of a
fourth war after the infiltration of guerrilla fighters and Pakistani
soldiers across the cease-fire line in Kashmir set off a battle for the
strategic Kargil Heights. The heavy fighting left hundreds of soldiers
and civilians dead.</TE>
<TE>   India has accused Musharraf of being the architect of the Kargil
attack. Musharraf, who seized power in a bloodless coup in October 1999,
was army chief of staff during the Kargil conflict.</TE>
<TE>   In a recent television interview, Benazir Bhutto said that when she
was Pakistan's prime minister, Musharraf came to her with a similar plan
to seize Kargil under the guise of "a war game."</TE>
<TE>   "I put my foot down," Bhutto told the interviewer. "I said that if
anything like this happens, it will be a big setback for Pakistan. We
will be forced to withdraw."</TE>
<TE>   Vajpayee said Saturday that he was burned again a few months after
inviting Musharraf to Agra when suicide attackers set off a devastating
car bomb outside the state assembly building in Srinagar, the summer
capital of India's Jammu and Kashmir state. The blast, and an ensuing gun
battle with police, left 40 people dead.</TE>
<TE>   India's government blamed the Pakistan-based group Jaish-e-Mohammed
for the Srinagar attack and the similar assault on the Parliament in New
Delhi on Dec. 13. The organization's leader, Maulana Masood Azhar, was
put under house arrest in late December for making inflammatory speeches.</TE>
<TE>   "The international community has agreed that no country would allow
its soil to be used, actively or passively, to finance, shelter, arm or
train terrorist groups," Vajpayee said. "The recent experience of
Afghanistan also shows graphically that tolerance, acquiescence or
sponsorship of terrorism creates a monster out of the control of its own
creator."</TE>
<TE>   The South Asian leaders' summit was supposed to concentrate on
improving economic cooperation among the members, but the current
conflict between India and Pakistan overshadowed discussions of issues
such as poverty and the trafficking of women and children in the sex
trade.</TE>
<TE>   Of the regional association's seven member countries, only two--the
tiny kingdom of Bhutan and the island nation of Maldives--do not have a
terrorism problem, said Sri Lankan President Chandrika Kumaratunga.</TE>
<TE>   "If South Asia remains mired in problems, the world will gradually
lose interest in our region," Musharraf told the conference. "Indeed,
there are already signs that is happening."</TE>
<TE>   With 22% of the world's population, South Asia produces less than 2%
of global income. The region's share of foreign capital investment in the
developing world dropped from 7% in the 1980s to just 3% in the 1990s,
the Pakistani president said.</TE>
<TE>   "We have the highest number of people living below the poverty line,"
Musharraf added. "Half a billion South Asians experienced a decline in
their incomes during the last decade."</TE>

<HD>Italy's Foreign Minister Steps Down</HD>
<DH>Politics: Renato Ruggiero had criticized the government's handling
of euro launch. His resignation is likely to stir unease in Europe.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL>ROME
</DL>
<LD>Italy's foreign minister resigned Saturday after a spat with Prime
Minister Silvio Berlusconi over the government's lukewarm reception of
the euro currency.</LD>
<LD>   Renato Ruggiero's resignation was likely to spark concerns among other
European nations since he had been seen as lending credibility to the
billionaire media mogul's administration and as balancing some of its
right-wing or anti-European Union ministers.</LD>
<LD>   Berlusconi's office said Ruggiero, 71, and the prime minister agreed
on a "consensual" parting.</LD>
<TE>   Tensions between Ruggiero and Berlusconi flared last week after the
foreign minister publicly criticized the government's handling of the
euro's Jan. 1 launch and some anti-euro comments by several of
Berlusconi's top ministers.</TE>
<TE>   Berlusconi fired back, telling the Rome daily La Repubblica on Friday
that he alone directed Italy's foreign policy, not Ruggiero. He said
Ruggiero was merely a "technical" functionary carrying out his policies.</TE>
<TE>   Some blame the government's less-than-enthusiastic welcome of the euro
in part for Italy's slow start in converting to the currency.</TE>
<TE>   On Saturday, EU officials reported that Italy was lagging behind much
of Europe in using euros for cash transactions.</TE>
<TE>   The resignation was the first in Berlusconi's 7-month-old conservative
government.</TE>
<TE>   The Italian news agency ANSA said Berlusconi would likely take over as
interim foreign minister and appoint a replacement in the coming days.</TE>
<TE>   Opposition politicians immediately condemned as "disastrous"
Berlusconi's handling of the crisis and said the prime minister had given
into the whims of his right-wing coalition members. They also demanded an
emergency debate in Parliament over the resignation.</TE>
<TE>   Berlusconi is mistrusted by many European politicians, and the
international standing of Ruggiero --a former president of the World
Trade Organization, longtime diplomat and international banker--was seen
as a reassurance.</TE>

<HD>Egyptian TV's Message Lost in Israel</HD>
<DH>Media: Newly launched show in Hebrew is aimed at reaching out to
the Jewish state. But it is available only to viewers who have satellite
dishes.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MICHAEL SLACKMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>CAIRO
</DL>
<LD>If a television show broadcasts across a sometimes-hostile border
but hardly anyone is watching, does it have any impact?</LD>
<LD>   That may be an odd twist on the point that befuddles children--whether
a tree falling in the forest makes a sound when no one's around. But it's
a question some Israelis are raising about Egypt's latest public
relations effort. State-owned Nile Television International for the first
time has begun broadcasting a Hebrew-language news show into Israel.</LD>
<LD>   Egyptians say their goal is to help bridge the gap in understanding
between Arabs and Israelis. But it appears that the broadcasters have
fallen into that gap, by assuming that Israelis get their television the
same way as do Egyptians, or at least wealthy Egyptians: via satellite
dish.</LD>
<TE>   Israel is wired for cable.</TE>
<TE>   "This is not a system we use in Israel," said Arad Nir, foreign editor
of Israel's Channel Two News. "Virtually no one has seen this show."</TE>
<TE>   Nadov Cohan, first secretary of the Israeli Embassy in Cairo, agreed.</TE>
<TE>   "Right now, no one sees this," he said. "You need a satellite dish,
and most of the people in Israel use a cable network."</TE>
<TE>   Egypt, like many other countries, including the United States,
broadcasts a range of foreign-language radio shows around the world to
promote its agenda. The Arab nation first started its Israel radio
broadcasts in 1954 with a program called "Voice of Cairo." That was
changed to "Voice of Peace" in 1979, when Egyptian President Anwar Sadat
signed a treaty with the Jewish state.</TE>
<TE>   The idea to expand into television came amid the violence between
Israelis and Palestinians over the last 15 months. As the bloodshed
became commonplace, Arab governments were criticized by their citizens
for doing virtually nothing substantive to support the Palestinian cause.</TE>
<TE>   The Egyptian public at times has seemed paralyzed and depressed,
caught between a desire to help the Palestinians and a reluctance to go
to war. Indeed, President Hosni Mubarak has taken no harsh actions
against the Israelis, short of recalling the Egyptian ambassador.</TE>
<TE>   Enter "Nile TV," or "Aroots Ha Nilos" in Hebrew.</TE>
<TE>   From studios here on the seventh floor of the state media building
along the Nile, Hassan Ali Hassan, the head of the station's Hebrew
section, was the first to introduce the show to would-be viewers. The
broadcasts are half an hour long, though the goal is to produce a
two-hour show of news and culture.</TE>
<TE>   "Happy New Year," Ali Hassan said Tuesday during the first show. "We
hope that every Israeli citizen will have his hopes fulfilled in the new
year, and that it will be a good and blessed year."</TE>
<TE>   Cohan, the Israeli Embassy official, has not seen a broadcast, though
he has a better chance in Egypt, where it is shown daily on regular
television from 6 to 6:30 p.m. Nevertheless, he said he is willing to
give Egypt the benefit of the doubt and to accept that its intentions are
positive.</TE>
<TE>   "In principle it could be a good thing," he said. "How it will be
operated in the future, we have to wait and see. My opinion is it is more
positive than negative."</TE>
<TE>   Yet even if the reception were crystal clear for all Israelis, it is
unlikely many would watch the show, or take it very seriously. Egyptian
media are regularly hostile to Israel, acting as an extension of the
public psyche in a land where people accept the cold peace but are still
piqued about the Jewish state's existence.</TE>
<TE>   The government newspaper, Al Ahram, for example, referred Thursday to
Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon's "criminal attacks on the
Palestinian people."</TE>
<TE>   In the new show's second broadcast, while the language was more
moderate, the message was pretty much the same. "We gave an account of
the Israelis' continued blockade of the Palestinians even though the
Palestinians are now quiet," Ali Hassan said. "There is still no Israeli
response to let the Palestinians get back to a normal life."</TE>
<TE>   Israelis are already expressing their skepticism about the show's
credibility.</TE>
<TE>   "We actually regard it as mere propaganda," said Nir, who broadcasts a
nightly foreign affairs program on Channel Two. "It has a 'nostalgic'
flair to it. During the Six-Day War in 1967 the Egyptians were
broadcasting [by radio] in Hebrew. They said things like, 'We are
conquering Tel Aviv, you better run.' This reminds people of that."</TE>
<TE>   From the Nile Television International offices, where young people
rush around, chatting and preparing the day's show, many staff members
said their goal is to confront Israel with truths that they maintain it
refuses to accept. They want to tell Israel that it must abide by United
Nations resolutions that call on the Jewish state to withdraw from
occupied territory.</TE>
<TE>   "The Israelis don't understand the basics," said Hala Hashish, vice
president and director of the station. "If you deprive someone of his
freedom, his identity and his existence, there definitely will be a
reaction. . . . The Israelis want to be safe, but how can you be safe
when you are an aggressor? If you want to be safe, don't be an
aggressor."</TE>
<TE>   The idea behind the show is to present this message in a more nuanced
way, Hashish said. But one person's nuance is another's club.</TE>
<TE>   Hashish and her crew talked Thursday about using an article from the
Egyptian daily newspaper Al Wafd on their show. The headline was: "Israel
will help the United States in a plan to beat Iraq. Israeli military
commanders gave their experience to assassinate Saddam Hussein."</TE>
<TE>   "It's critical, it's critical that we have permission," Hashish said
to one of her staffers during a phone conversation a few hours before
broadcast. Moments later a staff member strode into the office, a bit
shaken. "He yelled at me and said bad words to me," the man said to
Hashish, paraphrasing the unnamed higher-up to whom he had spoken: "How
can you translate such an article, on a 2-day-old show? This is a
political decision."</TE>
<TE>   "That's it," Hashish said, abruptly reversing course. "We aren't using
it."</TE>
<TE>   With all the work going into the show, with six broadcasters and a
crew of technical and executive people, not to mention the message
Hashish is so passionate about delivering to Israel, the television
executive didn't seem the least bit concerned that very little of her
target audience would be able to see the show. Though some Israelis
receive satellite feeds, few pick up the station's broadcasts. Most who
do, Cohan said, are Arab Israelis.</TE>
<TE>   "If they are interested," Hashish said, "they will get it."</TE>

<HD>5 Die in Storms in South Balkans</HD>
<DH>Weather: Greece and Bulgaria declare states of emergency in some
regions. Turkey, Romania and Albania also are battered.</DH>

<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL>ATHENS
</DL>
<LD>Freak winter storms paralyzed swathes of southeastern Europe on
Saturday, claiming five lives and prompting Greece and Bulgaria to
declare states of emergency in some areas.</LD>
<LD>   The storms blanketed much of the region with snow, blocking roads and
disrupting flights for a second day.</LD>
<LD>   In southwestern Turkey, two men froze to death, Turkish television
reported. Two others died in icy temperatures in Istanbul.</LD>
<TE>   Greek police found the body of an elderly woman partly covered by snow
who apparently had died from the cold in a suburb of Athens, the capital.</TE>
<TE>   The storm, which hit the region Friday and continued into Saturday,
forced the Greek government to declare states of emergency in Attica, the
province in which Athens is located, and two neighboring provinces.</TE>
<TE>   In northern Bulgaria, a state of emergency was called in three
municipalities where roads were blocked and power cuts left numerous
towns and villages without electricity, civil defense officials said.</TE>
<TE>   From the Aegean coast in the west to the Black Sea in the north,
thousands of Turkish villages were snowbound. The blizzards were expected
to move east across Turkey in the coming days, and officials warned
people not to leave their homes unless necessary.</TE>
<TE>   Greek Prime Minister Costas Simitis called it the worst weather in 40
years. "I would like to call on all citizens to be careful and limit
their movements. This is an unusual phenomenon and beautiful to watch but
also dangerous," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Athens was covered by as much as 8 inches of snow early Saturday, a
rare occurrence that left streets nearly deserted.</TE>
<TE>   The Parthenon temple atop the Acropolis was closed, and children built
snowmen and hurled snowballs in Athens' central square.</TE>
<TE>   In the capital's northern suburbs, where it was still snowing heavily
midafternoon Saturday, roads were impassable and blackouts were frequent.</TE>
<TE>   Flights from the international airport were severely disrupted,
although one runway was open with planes taking off and landing.</TE>
<TE>   In Istanbul, some international and domestic flights were canceled
Saturday as blizzards resumed, airport officials said.</TE>
<TE>   Roads were blocked and ferries across the Bosporus strait were
canceled for a second day, Turkey's NTV television said.</TE>
<TE>   In Romania, river ice had cut off water to several cities in the
Transylvania region. Authorities rescued more than 300 motorists stranded
by snow.</TE>
<TE>   Albania's Defense Ministry said the army was using trucks and
helicopters to make deliveries. Frozen pipes cut off the water supply to
several villages.</TE>

<HD>Radioactive Material in Georgia Leaves 3 Ill</HD>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>TBILISI, Georgia
</DL>
<LD>Three lumberjacks who found containers with highly radioactive
materials in a forest were hospitalized in serious condition, and
hundreds of villagers living nearby have been thrown into panic, Georgian
officials said Saturday.</LD>
<LD>   The two containers with strontium 90, believed to have been used in
signal beacons during the construction of a nearby hydroelectric plant 30
years ago, were found last month near the village of Dzhvari, about 135
miles northwest of Tbilisi, the capital.</LD>
<LD>   Experts from the International Atomic Energy Agency arrived in Tbilisi
on Saturday to visit the site, said Soso Kukushadze, head of the
radiation and nuclear security department of Georgia's Environment
Ministry.</LD>
<TE>   The area, about 550 yards in diameter, has been fenced off, Kukushadze
said. A special task force was being assembled, but he warned that
obtaining the equipment to remove the strontium was a question of
financing.</TE>
<TE>   "We hope the government allocates the necessary money," Kukushadze
said.</TE>
<TE>   The containers are emitting radiation at a rate of 15 roentgens an
hour from a distance of 5 feet--thousands of times higher than normal
background radiation.</TE>
<TE>   About 3,000 villagers live in the area, and many have started to
report headaches and other symptoms, but Kukushadze dismissed the cases
as "radiation phobia."</TE>
<TE>   "There is absolutely no threat to the health of the residents of
Dzhvari," Kukushadze said.</TE>

<HD>Islamic World's Hatred Dwarfs Its Admiration for America</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID LAMB</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>QUETTA, Pakistan
</DL>
<LD>Sattar Chisti is a Taliban kind of guy. His heart burns with
passion for Islam, and his mind seethes with the injustices of the West.
Osama bin Laden? A wise man, a true believer. The World Trade Center?
Everyone knows Bin Laden wasn't responsible. The Jews were.</LD>
<LD>   For an hour, hunkered down in his spice-laden cubicle in Quetta's
teeming market, Chisti, 36, speaks of his grievances against the United
States in the same soft, calm tones Bin Laden uses.</LD>
<LD>   "I'm 100% sure America wants to destroy Islam," he says.</LD>
<TE>   Still, he is happy to play host to an American visitor.</TE>
<TE>   "Let me pour you another cup of tea," he says.</TE>
<TE>   There are millions of voices like Chisti's in the Islamic world, from
the mosques of Cairo to the coffeehouses of Quetta, a ramshackle border
town full of fierce, bearded faces and veiled women scurrying to stay out
of sight. In each, one hears misgivings about the West that range from
suspicion to hatred and are rooted in wounds, ancient and modern,
reopened by the war in Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   Americans have asked in the aftermath of Sept. 11, "Why do they hate
us?" The answer is, they don't. They are admiring, even envious, of the
treasures in a free society such as America and that are missing in
countries that are often feudal and repressive: the right to choose,
opportunity, prosperity and the rule of law. But they do hate U.S.
policies they see as based on arrogance, self-interest, military
aggressiveness and a willingness to inflict harm on Muslims in the Middle
East and, now, Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>U.S. Support for Israel Galvanizes Muslims</TE>
<TE>   It is nearly impossible to ask anyone, be he fundamentalist or
moderate, how he views the United States without hearing the words
"Israel" and "Palestine." The unswerving U.S. support for Israel in the
occupied territories is, the thinking goes, the symbol of all that has
gone wrong. It is the issue that galvanizes the Muslim spirit and is more
deeply felt than any other grievance, be that sanctions on Iraq, U.S.
troops in the holy land of Saudi Arabia or the mistaken bombing of Afghan
villages.</TE>
<TE>   "The whole region has become radicalized and criminalized because of
U.S. actions, particularly in Palestine," said Agha Murtuza Pooya, former
director of the Institute for Strategic Studies in the Pakistani capital,
Islamabad. "You blame the Palestinians for the violence, but never the
Israelis who kill Muslims to protect a few thousand settlers living on
land that's not theirs. If you understand this policy, please explain it
to me, because I don't."</TE>
<TE>   "The collapse of the Taliban doesn't change our movement," said
Maulana Jalic Jan, a mullah in Peshawar, Pakistan. "The Islamic movement
is now in every part of the world. But if the United States changes its
policies, we will offer friendship to America. There will be no problem."</TE>
<TE>   That's probably an oversimplification. Blaming the United States for
the world's injustices will always be convenient for those wanting to
deflect focus from the lack of unity and the societal shortcomings in the
Islamic world. It is a world where kings and generals have given the
masses no outlet to vent their frustrations and where the demands of
modernity perplex those trapped in a medieval mind-set dating to the
prophet Muhammad's time.</TE>
<TE>   Many religious scholars believe these shortcomings help explain the
appeal of fundamentalism and Bin Laden's message. Bin Laden does not rant
and rage. He speaks gently with the surety of a teacher. He offers the
disenfranchised masses something to believe in as participants, not mere
spectators--the protection of Islam. For them, the mosques become a
refuge from failed societies beset by poverty, illiteracy, oppression and
joblessness.</TE>
<TE>   "It's only the deeply religious people that I'd call anti-American,"
said Dervish Durrani, a college professor in Quetta. "Certainly no one
believes the United States is playing a fair game in Palestine, but that
doesn't mean most of us are anti-American. I think America went to war in
Afghanistan to wipe out terrorists, not kill Muslims."</TE>
<TE>   The United States' edgy relations with the Islamic world today belie a
long history of friendship.</TE>
<TE>   The first country to recognize the United States was Morocco, in 1777.
The treaty of friendship that Thomas Jefferson and John Adams signed with
Sultan Mohammed ben Abdallah III remains the longest uninterrupted accord
in U.S. history. Oman and the United States signed a treaty of amity and
commerce in 1883, promising "perpetual peace."</TE>
<TE>   In 1956, President Eisenhower was instrumental in restoring Egyptian
sovereignty over the Suez Canal after an attempted takeover by Britain
and France in collusion with Israel. In 1957, a young American senator,
John F. Kennedy, stunned everyone by siding with Algeria in its war of
independence against France.</TE>
<TE>   Most Arab leaders, political analysts say, support the war against
terrorism, at least in part because Islamic fundamentalists represent a
distinct threat to their own feudal regimes. In recent years, extremists
have attempted to topple governments in Egypt, Saudi Arabia and Algeria
on the grounds that they preached secularism. In 1981, radicals
assassinated President Anwar Sadat of Egypt, who had made peace with
Israel. He had said shortly before his death: "This [fundamentalism] is
not religion. It is obscenity. These are lies, the criminal use of
religious power to misguide people."</TE>
<TE>   But few Muslim leaders--with the exception of Pakistan's President
Pervez Musharraf--have had the courage to condemn the rise in Islamic
extremism that led to the Sept. 11 attacks. To do so, they fear, would
anger their own mullahs and inflame the passion for political change that
spreads from the mosques.</TE>
<TE>   The leadership's silence has made it difficult for the United States
to counter anti-American sentiments in the region. American credibility
has sunk so low that in an Internet poll by the satellite TV channel Al
Jazeera, 80% of respondents thought that the videotape the Pentagon
released showing Bin Laden apparently taking credit for the Sept. 11
attacks was a fake.</TE>

<HD>Taliban Chief Again Eludes His Pursuers</HD>
<DH>War: The hunt for Omar grows more frustrating. U.S.-led coalition
chalks up several successes, including a hand-over of weapons by
warlords.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ERIC SLATER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>KABUL, Afghanistan
</DL>
<LD>Taliban leader Mullah Mohammed Omar has slipped through the fingers
of U.S. and anti-Taliban forces yet again, several sources said Saturday,
after nearly a week of reports that the mysterious cleric had finally
been cornered.</LD>
<LD>   One security official in the south-central Afghan city of Baghran said
Omar had sped away on a motorcycle. Another official said he'd never been
there at all. The interim Afghan government's Foreign Ministry spokesman,
Omar Samad, said the former ruler might have moved through the area in
recent days but had never settled in.</LD>
<LD>   "It doesn't matter to us whether he escaped on a motorbike, on a bike,
on a donkey or on foot," Samad said. "The goal is, he needs to be
arrested, he needs to be brought to justice."</LD>
<TE>   The hunt for Omar began a month ago, after he fled the Taliban
regime's southern stronghold, Kandahar, before the city fell. Still, as
the pursuit of him--like that of Osama bin Laden--grew yet more
frustrating Saturday, the U.S. and coalition countries chalked up several
successes in their campaign against the Taliban and Bin Laden's Al Qaeda
network.</TE>
<TE>   For one thing, the search for Omar, along with pressure by new
government leaders in Helmand province, has prompted local warlords to
turn over hundreds of tons of large and small arms as well as ammunition
to anti-Taliban forces, officials here said.</TE>
<TE>   Pakistan, meanwhile, handed over Abdul Salam Zaeef, the former Taliban
ambassador to Pakistan, to U.S. forces somewhere along the border with
Pakistan on Saturday, U.S. and Afghan officials said. The bespectacled
Zaeef, who as spokesman for the Taliban became the face of the movement
to the world after the attacks on the World Trade Center and Pentagon, is
now the highest-ranking Taliban official in U.S. custody.</TE>
<TE>   Zaeef had requested asylum in Pakistan, but his request was rejected,
and he was, technically, deported back to Afghanistan--where U.S. forces
were waiting.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier, U.S. forces arrested the highest-ranking Al Qaeda member
captured since the war began, Ibn Al-Shaykh al-Libi, who also was handed
over by Pakistan. Al-Libi, like Zaeef, was being held in southern
Afghanistan on Saturday along with about 300 other prisoners. The two men
are expected to be interrogated by U.S. agents seeking information on the
whereabouts of Bin Laden, Omar and other Al Qaeda and Taliban leaders.</TE>
<TE>   At a news briefing Saturday night, Samad, the Foreign Ministry
spokesman, offered condolences on behalf of interim Prime Minister Hamid
Karzai to the family of Army Special Forces soldier Nathan Ross Chapman,
31, a sergeant first class who a day earlier became the first U.S.
serviceman killed in action in Afghanistan. He died during a firefight in
the eastern province of Paktia.</TE>
<TE>   Samad also reiterated the interim government's concern about reported
civilian casualties from U.S. airstrikes, the latest in the village of
Qalaye Niazi, also in Paktia province. The strike might have killed as
many as 52 people, according to the United Nations, though it's unclear
how many of them were civilians and how many Al Qaeda or Taliban
fighters.</TE>
<TE>   Samad suggested strongly that the U.S. had legitimate targets in the
village, including an Al Qaeda ammunition dump--the first such concession
by the government here.</TE>
<TE>   "The enemy is a tricky enemy, and they . . . sometimes use the
civilian population as a shelter and even take them hostage," Samad said.</TE>
<TE>   Also Saturday, the U.S. envoy to Afghanistan, Zalmay Khalilzad,
arrived in his home country after a 30-year absence and was scheduled to
hold his first meetings with Karzai and other leaders just hours later.</TE>

<LD>German authorities arrested a suspected member of Osama bin Laden's
Al Qaeda network in a late-night raid at a four-star hotel in
Monchengladbach, police said early today.</LD>
<LD>   The unarmed man, who had an Italian name, was charged with membership
in an illegal organization, authorities said.</LD>
<LD>   Federal authorities had tipped local police about three wanted men but
only one was found during a large operation late Saturday, said
Monchengladbach police spokesman Michael Gutze.</LD>
<TE>   "We are still checking his identity. . . . By appearance he appears to
be between 30 and 40 years old," Gutze said.</TE>
<TE>   German authorities have conducted a massive investigation into
possible links to the Sept. 11 attacks on the United States after it
emerged that Mohamed Atta and other alleged hijackers had lived in the
northern city of Hamburg.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities are also investigating the detained man's travel plans and
other details. Monchengladbach, with a population of 270,000, is near
Dusseldorf in western Germany.</TE>
<TE>   "He checked in alone today at 2 p.m.," Eddie Adam, night manager at
the Dorint Hotel, said after midnight.</TE>
<TE>   "Then we received a tip from the federal criminal authorities who came
at around midnight.</TE>
<TE>   "Police are still here checking rooms."</TE>

<DL>BRENTWOOD, N.H.
</DL>
<LD>A teenager who told police he sent an anthrax-laced letter to
Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle is a compulsive liar who has been
treated in a state psychiatric hospital, his father said Saturday.</LD>
<LD>   Elijah Wallace, 18, made the claim when he was arrested for breaking
into a vacant home Friday. Police found him hiding in a closet with a gun
and two knives.</LD>
<LD>   Investigators also found five letters addressed to local businesses
and a bag of white powder in the house with Wallace. Preliminary tests on
one of the letters was negative for anthrax.</LD>
<TE>   Wallace told police that he was preparing to send anthrax-laced
letters, and had already sent four, including one mailed last week to
Daschle, said Fremont, N.H., Police Chief Neal Janvrin.</TE>
<TE>   But officials said they do not believe Wallace sent the Daschle letter
because, with heightened security measures, it would have taken up to
three weeks for a letter to reach the congressman.</TE>
<TE>   The envelope mailed to Daschle contained a white powdery substance and
a threatening letter. Army scientists and the FBI said Friday that the
substance was talc and contained no trace of the deadly bacteria.</TE>
<TE>   "He's telling a story that is a sensational story to, I think, feel
important," the suspect's father, Eric Wallace, said Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   Wallace said his son was diagnosed as a child with Asperger syndrome,
a form of autism.</TE>
<TE>   "We've been trying since the third grade to get him help, but it's
been very difficult," the elder Wallace said.</TE>
<TE>   Wallace, 45, a software engineer, said his son had been in and out of
jail, mostly on minor theft charges.</TE>
<TE>   Elijah Wallace began assaulting his family members last winter, his
father said. His parents had him committed to the state psychiatric
hospital last February and he was released in April.</TE>
<TE>   Wallace entered no plea when he was arraigned on a burglary charge
Saturday. He was returned to a county jail on $50,000 bail.</TE>

<HD>15 Held in Singapore Bomb Plots</HD>
<DH>Southeast Asia: A regional crackdown on terrorism has led to 13
arrests in Malaysia.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL>SINGAPORE
</DL>
<LD>Authorities have arrested 15 suspected militants, some of whom
trained at Al Qaeda camps in Afghanistan, for allegedly plotting bombings
in this city state, the government said Saturday.</LD>
<LD>   Singapore's announcement came a day after Malaysian authorities said
they had locked up 13 suspects with possible links to Osama bin Laden
since Dec. 9.</LD>
<LD>   The parallel sweeps in the two countries, using laws allowing
detention without trial, came after Southeast Asian leaders signed an
accord at a regional summit in Brunei to join forces to stamp out
cross-border terrorism.</LD>
<TE>   The suspects in Singapore were arrested between Dec. 9 and Dec. 24,
and detailed information on bomb construction, photographs and video
footage of targeted buildings here were found in their homes and offices,
the Ministry of Home Affairs said. Al Qaeda-linked material, falsified
passports and forged immigration stamps also were found, a ministry
statement said.</TE>
<TE>   The suspects have links to militant groups in Malaysia and Indonesia,
the statement said.</TE>
<TE>   The 15 were detained under Singapore's Internal Security Act, which
allows people to be held indefinitely without a trial. All but one of the
suspects is Singaporean. One suspect was a Singaporean who became a
Malaysian citizen, the statement said.</TE>
<TE>   Thirteen of the suspects in Singapore are members of a clandestine
organization called Jemaah Islamiah, the statement said. It is unclear
whether the two others are also members of the group, it said.</TE>
<TE>   Malaysian police said that the militants it has arrested had been
instructed by two key Indonesian figures in Jemaah Islamiah--Abu Jibril,
who has been detained in Malaysia, and Hambali Isamuddin, who is sought
by Malaysian police.</TE>
<TE>   Singapore has close economic and military ties with the United States
and has been a staunch supporter of the post-Sept. 11 crackdown on
terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   "The activities of this group included fund collection for terrorist
groups, active surveillance of establishments in Singapore targeted for
terrorist bombing, as well as attempts to procure materials for bomb
construction, including large quantities of ammonium nitrate," the
statement said.</TE>
<TE>   It did not specify what buildings were targeted by the group. Some
members of the network are believed to have fled the country, the
ministry said.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>A white Cincinnati police officer whose fatal shooting of an
unarmed black man led to protests and three days of rioting has resigned
and gone to work for a suburban police force.</LD>
<LD>   Stephen Roach, 27, quit Friday, the Cincinnati Enquirer reported.
Roach, who had been on the city police force since 1997, will begin work
as an officer in Evendale village on Jan. 21.</LD>
<LD>   Roach had been assigned to the Cincinnati Police Division's auto
impound lot since his acquittal in the April 7 shooting of Timothy
Thomas, 19, in a dark alley. Thomas, who was wanted on 14 outstanding
warrants, had fled police minutes before he was shot.</LD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Nearly a dozen large trailers parked on Big Detroit Lake for a
snowmobile race sank into the water when the ice was weakened by mild
temperatures.</LD>
<LD>   There were no injuries, but some trailers and the equipment inside
were completely submerged in the northwestern Minnesota lake.</LD>
<LD>   "It's a terrible situation, especially for the racers," Fire Chief
Jeff Swanson said. "We've got a lot of dollars in the water."</LD>
<TE>   Wally Scheer, director of the World Snowmobile Assn. Pro Ice race,
said a driver called him at about 5 a.m. from inside one of the sinking
trailers.</TE>
<TE>   Race crews scrambled to move their snowmobiles and other vehicles to
dry land, but much of the equipment ended up in the water.</TE>

<LD>   The ordinance, which the City Council had approved unanimously, could
undermine protections for blacks and others in contracting, hiring and
delivery, Menino said.</LD>
<LD>   "I am gravely concerned this measure will have far-reaching unintended
negative effects," he said in a statement.</LD>
<TE>   City Council President Charles C. Yancey, who pushed the measure,
calling the term "anachronistic and demeaning," said he may seek an
override, which would require the support of nine of the 13 council
members.</TE>

<HD>Radical New York Councilman Aims to Shake City Up</HD>
<DH>Government: Activist Charles Barron is part of a new and sizable
group of minority lawmakers.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEFFREY GETTLEMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK
</DL>
<LD>He's got a closet full of Nehru suits, an unswerving affection for
Mao and Che, and when it comes time to say goodbye, he throws his fist in
the air and sometimes shouts, "The struggle continues!"</LD>
<LD>   Charles Barron, once a Black Panther, now a freshly minted city
councilman, is something of a time warp--but he's also a hint of what's
to come.</LD>
<LD>   "I'm a black revolutionary, a proud radical, an African American
militant, all those bad words, " he says. "And I'm ready to kick some
butt."</LD>
<TE>   Step into the rotunda at New York's City Hall, and you can hear the
drum beat-- actually, a goatskin drum beat--of a new day in Big Apple
politics. The exit of former Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, who despite other
successes severely alienated the black community, has created space for a
fresh look at African American issues.</TE>
<TE>   Last week a record number of newly elected black politicians were
sworn into the New York City Council, and several celebrated with African
drums and dance, symbols of a new, defiant agenda.</TE>
<TE>   "There's definitely an openness to consider issues that haven't been
looked at in a while," said Columbia University political science
professor Steven Cohen. "It's going to get interesting."</TE>
<TE>   There's no overstating how critical a time this is for city leaders
with rubble from the World Trade Center still smoldering, a financial
crisis looming and the public a bit adrift and jittery about life after
Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   There's also never been such a sudden transfer of power, with an
untested mayor, billionaire businessman Michael R. Bloomberg, succeeding
a lionized Giuliani and 38 of the 51 city council members rookies thanks
to newly enacted term limits.</TE>
<TE>   Enter Barron, a 51-year-old community activist from one of the city's
toughest neighborhoods, East New York in Brooklyn. He's pushing a very
Afrocentric set of issues. He wants reparations for slave descendants and
for Ebonics to be taught in school to help black children learn English.</TE>
<TE>   And he has his own personal project: diversifying the city's art
collection.</TE>
<TE>   Instead of 6-foot-tall portraits of George Washington and
Revolutionary War hero Marquis de Lafayette, which hang in the City
Council chamber, Barron wants to showcase images of black leaders such as
Malcolm X.</TE>
<TE>   "Why would I want to look at a picture of a slave owner, someone who
thought I was three-fifths of a human being?"</TE>
<TE>   A good chunk of Barron's charisma is his radiant pride in the black
experience. His two-hour induction ceremony Wednesday was almost like the
coronation of an African king.</TE>
<TE>   There were libations and Swahili blessings, barefoot dancers
undulating to the pitter-patter of finely stoked drums and a
post-ceremony feast.</TE>
<TE>   Barron's "inaugural address," as he called it, was spirited and very
participatory.</TE>
<TE>   After he spoke about reparations ("We were raped. We were murdered. We
were burned. And you have the nerve to say forget about it? Not in my
lifetime.") a woman in the audience shouted: "Talk about it, yes sir,
talk about it!"</TE>
<TE>   Then someone yelled: "Teach, Charles. Teach. Teach!"</TE>
<TE>   Many community leaders praised Barron's commitment to social justice.
"In Charles, we're not getting some half-packaged shuffling 'Tom,' " said
Rev. Herbert Daughtry, a local activist. "We're getting the real thing,
someone who can articulate our cause, someone who will never make us
ashamed when he speaks."</TE>
<TE>   Barron's message can be combative, often closer to the militancy of
Malcolm X than the nonviolent resistance of the Rev. Martin Luther King
Jr.</TE>
<TE>   "If you slap my cheek, I'm not going to give you my other cheek," he
said. "I'm going to slap you back."</TE>
<TE>   He grew up hard, first in a poor section of Queens and then in the
Lillian Wald housing project on Manhattan's lower east side. He joined
the Black Panthers at 19.</TE>
<TE>   After a few years he left the Panthers, a group with a mixed legacy of
battling police and helping the poor, and went to Hunter College, where
he studied sociology. Soon he was working with Pan-African groups and
marching with the Rev. Al Sharpton. Barron rallied against police
brutality and served as an anti-crime block captain in his neighborhood,
formerly the homicide capital of New York.</TE>
<TE>   Barron, the founder of a leadership training group, had run
unsuccessfully for City Council in 1997.</TE>
<TE>   Like many other black leaders, he recoils at the mention of the former
mayor.</TE>
<TE>   "I can't stand all this crap about what Giuliani did on 9/11," Barron
said. "He just did his job. He's mayor, for God's sake. He should have
been out there."</TE>
<TE>   Anti-Giuliani feelings have been coursing through the black community
for years, but it had been considered unpatriotic to criticize him after
the September terrorist attacks. Only now are some of these feelings
coming out.</TE>
<TE>   The animus stems from Giuliani's unyielding support for police, even
in cases of alleged brutality; his refusal to meet with Sharpton, one of
the city's most popular black leaders; and the state of the public
schools, which didn't seem to be a focus of his administration.</TE>
<TE>   "Things were so bad before that if Bloomberg now just winks at us, it
makes us feel good," Barron said.</TE>
<TE>   Bloomberg appears to be more inclusive and willing to meet with
community leaders. And this year more people of color are on the City
Council than ever before: 14 blacks, 10 Latinos and one Asian American, a
first.</TE>
<TE>   But it's early still, and most of the political energy is on the
glaring $3-billion to $5-billion budget gap.</TE>
<TE>   City Hall feels a world away from East New York, a hard-luck
neighborhood 10 miles east of Manhattan.</TE>
<TE>   On Friday, Barron stepped out of his district office and began walking
home. He passed vacant lots, teenagers idling on street corners, a dimly
lighted jerk chicken shop and a burly man with dreadlocks who yelled to
him, warmly, "Hey, Charles, I'm organizing the troops!"</TE>
<TE>   "That's right, brother, we're going to shake things up!" Barron yelled
back. "This is all about taking the 'hood to the hall."</TE>

<HD>Secrets Were Toast at Reporter's Breakfasts</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHANNA NEUMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>President Reagan once called him the king of cholesterol, and it's
true his breakfasts were larded with eggs, bacon, sausage and hash
browns.</LD>
<LD>   Health concerns, however, did little to stem the crowd's appetite for
news.</LD>
<LD>   For more than 35 years, journalist Godfrey "Budge" Sperling presided
over Washington's premier power breakfast. Banning three ingredients that
usually attract politicians--television reporters, photographers and wire
services--Sperling managed to lure his guests with an hour of genteel
questions asked as uniformed waiters served breakfast on fine china at
cloth-draped tables.</LD>
<TE>   In this era of sound bites, "gotcha" journalism and infotainment, the
Sperling breakfasts seemed bound to become a thing of the past.</TE>
<TE>   Though Sperling, 86, hosted his last--and 3,241th--breakfast in
December, his newspaper, the Christian Science Monitor, plans to continue
the tradition in the new year, starting later this month.</TE>
<TE>   It started in 1966 when Sperling ("Budge" was a childhood nickname
that stuck) invited Sen. Charles H. Percy (R-Ill.) to lunch with a few
other reporters. Next time out, when New York Mayor John V. Lindsay
agreed to meet the group, the National Press Club was booked for lunch,
so Sperling tried breakfast.</TE>
<TE>   The rest is history--and quite a bit of it at that.</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Robert F. Kennedy was a guest early in 1968. Pressed on whether
he planned to run for president, he said it was "inconceivable" that he
would challenge President Lyndon B. Johnson. Then, someone came in with a
bulletin saying that the Viet Cong had launched the Tet offensive. By the
end of breakfast, Kennedy sounded like a candidate, Sperling said.</TE>
<TE>   In 1995, there was the Newt Gingrich fiasco. At one breakfast, House
Speaker Gingrich (R-Ga.) hinted that his refusal to compromise on the
budget, and the resulting government shutdown, was inspired in part by
his mistreatment aboard Air Force One. President Clinton had not talked
to the speaker on Air Force One as they returned from the funeral of
Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin. Then, adding to the indignity,
Gingrich said he was forced to exit the plane from the rear steps.
Democrats pounced on Gingrich's breakfast pronouncement, and the New York
Daily News ran a cartoon of a diaper-clad Gingrich under the headline,
"Cry Baby."</TE>
<TE>   The Gingrich flap buttressed the view some held that guests at
Sperling breakfasts did not so much break news as commit indiscretions.</TE>
<TE>   "The Sperling ambience could be entrapping for the guest," said Chuck
Lewis, bureau chief for Hearst newspapers. No cameras. No reporters
posturing for television. No shouted questions. "I don't think Gingrich
had the slightest idea that he was making news," Lewis said.</TE>
<TE>   Sometimes the setting's gentility also numbed the reporters. Political
consultant Edward J. Rollins bragged in 1993 that he had won the New
Jersey gubernatorial election for Christie Whitman by giving black
ministers $500,000 to suppress the black vote. The Columbia Journalism
Review later reported that at least nine of the 14 to 20 reporters in
attendance did not file a first-day story on his remarks. There was
plenty of coverage later, after Whitman denied the charge, a lawsuit was
filed and Rollins recanted.</TE>
<TE>   For many print journalists, especially regional reporters whose
newspapers do not command the same cachet as large dailies, the
breakfasts were a godsend--even at $30 a person--especially when Sperling
delivered top-name guests.</TE>
<TE>   "We wait a long time to see [National Security Advisor] Condoleezza
Rice," said Sara Fritz, Washington bureau chief for the St. Petersburg
Times.</TE>
<TE>   Fritz, once a reporter for the Los Angeles Times, had two other
observations about the breakfasts.</TE>
<TE>   First, the food. "If you get there early, you can get some cereal and
fruit"--healthier options added in the 1980s, when cholesterol made the
news.</TE>
<TE>   Then, the crowd. "When I first went 30 years ago, I could not believe
how old those people were," she said of the reporters. "Now I'm one of
them. It's like the Veterans of Foreign Wars for journalists. It's people
with a lot of experience and not much energy."</TE>
<TE>   The breakfasts were also the last refuge for generalists in an age of
specialized beats like science writing and defense coverage. (The latter
has spawned its own breakfast, with less cutlery and fewer participants.)</TE>
<TE>   Sperling was a veteran campaign reporter, so the guest list was heavy
on politics. From Clinton, who came with his wife, Hillary, to douse
rumors of marital problems, to Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), candidates saw
the breakfasts as a testing ground, a must-attend as critical as an
appearance on the Sunday TV talk shows.</TE>
<TE>   Washington Post columnist David Broder, one of 11 reporters who
attended the first session, has "consumed my share of scrambled eggs" and
taken stockpiled notes on thousands of public officials. Broder mused
about the companionship that came in leisurely on-the-record sessions.</TE>
<TE>   "They did a tremendous lot of work in lining up people," Broder said.
"It involved knowing when the governor of California was coming into town
so we could grab him. They got people who were good, at a timely moment."</TE>
<TE>   Sperling said the breakfasts weren't so much designed as evolved. And,
for the record, he never intended to bait guests with "softball"
questions.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't like the word 'softball,' " he said. "I do like civility, and
I never liked the idea of angry encounters."</TE>
<TE>   But, he added, referring to powerhouse reporters who asked the
follow-up questions around his table, "we don't just sit back and let
them eat us for breakfast, either."</TE>
<TE>   Broder agreed. "Budge is a gentleman, no question about that. It's
just that, like a lot of us, he needs to clear his throat a little before
he gets to the point."</TE>

<HD>Outcry Over Pets in Pet Food</HD>
<DH>Rendering: The practice of boiling down euthanized dogs and cats
for industrial fat and protein causes an uproar in St. Louis.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEPHANIE SIMON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>ST. LOUIS
</DL>
<LD>It started with footage of Blacky and Scoop, melt-your-heart dogs
with no one to claim them, alone at the city pound--and due to be put to
death within hours. "No one wants them. Alive, that is," the reporter
said.</LD>
<LD>   The film then cut to a rendering plant that boils down the city's
euthanized dogs, along with dead pigs and cows from local farms and
leftover bones, hooves and innards from slaughterhouses. The end products
are used to make cosmetics and fertilizer, gelatin and poultry feed,
pharmaceuticals and pet food.</LD>
<LD>   It was the pet food that got people.</LD>
<TE>   The report last month by KMOV-TV's Jamie Allman--headlined "What's
Getting Into Your Pets"--suggested that dead dogs and cats from local
shelters were ending up in kibble. As proof, Allman aired footage of a
tanker truck entering the rendering plant, a truck emblazoned with the
motto "Serving the Pet Food Industry."</TE>
<TE>   Pet owners went nuts.</TE>
<TE>   Thousands turned to KMOV's online polls to register their disgust.
Scores more called animal control departments to demand an end to the
practice. The St. Louis Post-Dispatch ran a cartoon showing a mangled
collar poking out of a bowl of dog food. "It was unbelievable, the amount
of reaction we got," Allman said.</TE>
<TE>   The Millstadt Rendering Co., a small family business that for decades
had been taking the region's euthanized animals free, in what the owners
thought was a public service, reeled in the face of so much rage. "A
disaster for the industry," groaned Clifton Smith, a consultant to the
firm. "There's too many people out there who think their pets are like
children."</TE>
<TE>   Hoping to free themselves from the public-relations fiasco, the
rendering plant announced just before Christmas that it would stop
accepting euthanized dogs and cats.</TE>
<TE>   But the local animal shelters couldn't stop euthanizing. And so in
counties and small towns throughout the region, animal carcasses began to
pile up.</TE>
<TE>   "We were taken flat-footed," said Chris Byrne, an animal control
official in St. Louis County.</TE>
<TE>   Every solution was pricey. Hauling the animals to the nearest
industrial-scale crematory would cost the county more than $57,000 a
year. Building a crematory would cost up to $100,000. And there would be
the contentious question of where to put it.</TE>
<TE>   In the short term, with freezer space limited, the county has been
forced to send its dead dogs and cats to a landfill. The city of St.
Louis has taken the same route, arranging for a refrigerated trash truck
to pick up the carcasses.</TE>
<TE>   This makeshift solution has prompted still more concerns. If the
landfills are not properly lined, the decaying corpses could leach into
ground water. If they're not promptly covered, scavengers can pick off
the dead dogs and cats. And, as some have pointed out, chucking Fido in a
dump scarcely seems a more dignified end than cooking him in a vat with
dead cows.</TE>
<TE>   It's a conundrum for animal control officers like Richard Steveson,
who has to find a way to dispose of up to 3,500 animals a year in St.
Louis. "I like for everything to be done as humanely as possible, even
though the animal has already expired," Steveson said. But, given the
alternatives, he figures rendering was as good a method as any. He didn't
know that the rendered material could end up in pet food, he said. "But
even if I had, I don't know what I would have done about it."</TE>
<TE>   Lost in all the emotion have been the facts about rendering--and about
pet food.</TE>
<TE>   Rendering has long been considered one of the most environmentally
friendly ways to dispose of animal carcasses, because it recycles them
into useful fat and protein. By far the bulk of rendered material comes
from slaughterhouses. But some plants also mix in road kill, the
trimmings from supermarket delis, dead farm animals and euthanized pets
from shelters. Los Angeles city and county shelters send more than
120,000 dead dogs and cats to be rendered in a typical year.</TE>
<TE>   Members of The Pet Food Institute, who make 95% of the dog and cat
food sold in the United States, use rendered material from livestock in
their chow. But they insist there are no ground up pets in their pet
food.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a matter of good business," spokesman Stephen Payne said. "We've
decided that if this is upsetting to people--and it clearly is--we should
take extraordinary measures to make sure it never happens."</TE>
<TE>   Still, it is not illegal to use rendered material from dogs and cats
in pet food. And while no one keeps official figures, there's some
evidence it happens.</TE>
<TE>   The Food and Drug Administration has found "very, very low levels" of
sodium pentobarbital--the chemical used to euthanize animals--in some
brands of dog food, said Stephen Sundloff, director of the FDA's Center
for Veterinary Medicine. The agency is investigating whether the traces
are "of any significance at all," Sundloff said.</TE>
<TE>   Overall, experts see little health risk in rendered pets entering the
animal (or human) food chain, because the high temperatures used in the
process kill most agents of disease.</TE>
<TE>   As for the Millstadt Rendering Co., its owners are trying to get back
to business as usual.</TE>
<TE>   They maintain that the TV report unfairly linked their product to pet
food (the tanker truck with the pet industry logo, they say, was headed
to a separate rendering plant that handles restaurant grease). Still,
they acknowledge they have no idea where their product ends up. It's sold
to brokers who sell it to manufacturers. The way they look at it, they
don't need to know the details--and the public probably doesn't want to.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't have anything to hide," Smith said, "but people really don't
want to hear about rendering. It's an ugly thing."</TE>

<DL>RALEIGH, N.C.
</DL>
<LD>Rain appeared likely to dissolve the thick blanket of snow that
covered much of the Deep South on Saturday as a fast-moving storm system
entered the state from the west.</LD>
<LD>   Today, areas hardest hit by last week's storm could see a repeat of
the 40- and 50-degree temperatures that brought some relief Saturday,
forecasters said.</LD>
<LD>   "I think that's going to help us as far as dissolving the snow and
getting rid of it," said Department of Transportation maintenance
engineer Jerry Linder, in Raleigh.</LD>
<TE>   There were few major traffic problems Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   Sixteen inches of snow fell on parts of Virginia, North Carolina,
South Carolina and Georgia. The winter blast, which swept through the
South from Wednesday to early Friday, knocked out thousands of homes'
electricity and paralyzed a region ill-equipped to deal with such storms.
Treacherous conditions were blamed for at least 10 traffic deaths.</TE>
<TE>   In Florida's Panhandle, where temperatures dipped to 19 degrees in the
wake of the storm, an infant died in a house fire blamed on a space
heater too close to a mattress. Heaters were also blamed for house fires
that killed eight people in Louisiana and two in Alabama.</TE>
<TE>   Operations at Atlanta's Hartsfield International Airport, the nation's
busiest airport, were still recovering Friday. Ben DeCosta, the general
manager of Hartsfield, where hundreds of flights were canceled, said he
will meet with airline executives Monday to discuss ways to prevent
future snow-related backups.</TE>
<TE>   DeCosta said he called for the meeting after learning that, during the
storm, some planes full of passengers waited as long as 10 hours for
de-icing before leaving or returning to the terminal.</TE>

<HD>A WWII History Repeats Itself</HD>
<DH>Publishing: Book on bomber pilots includes parts of earlier work.
Some call it plagiarism.</DH>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK
</DL>
<LD>Historian Stephen E. Ambrose has been accused of plagiarizing
sections of "The Wild Blue," his recent book about World War II bomber
pilots.</LD>
<LD>   Fred Barnes, a columnist for The Weekly Standard, argues in the Jan.
14 issue of the magazine that Ambrose borrowed passages from "The Wings
of Morning," a book by historian Thomas Childers about the same topic.</LD>
<LD>   Ambrose included footnotes that cite Childers' book as a source for
the sections, but the footnotes do not acknowledge that he quotes
directly from the book, Barnes said.</LD>
<TE>   Childers told the New York Times that he had concluded that Ambrose
borrowed from his book extensively and said he was "sort of
disappointed."</TE>
<TE>   The two books have several similar passages, Barnes said. For example,
Childers wrote about ball turret gunners: "It was the most physically
uncomfortable, isolated, and terrifying position on the ship. The gunner
climbed into the ball, pulled the hatch closed, and was then lowered into
position."</TE>
<TE>   A section in Ambrose's book, focusing on former Sen. George S.
McGovern, reads: "The ball turret was, as McGovern said, the most
physically uncomfortable, isolated, and terrifying position on the plane.
The gunner climbed into the ball, pulled the hatch closed and was then
lowered into position."</TE>
<TE>   Ambrose, sending word through a relative, declined to comment
Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   A spokesman for the Simon &amp; Schuster division of Viacom, which
published the book in August, told the New York Times: "All research
garnered from previously published material is appropriately footnoted."</TE>
<TE>   Ambrose, a professor emeritus at the University of New Orleans, has
written more than 25 books.</TE>
