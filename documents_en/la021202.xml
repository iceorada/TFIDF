<KH>NEW YORK, N.Y. GERALDINE BAUM</KH>
<HD>The Chin family helping to spin reggae's evolution</HD>

<LD>Every day dozens of FedEx boxes packed with 7-inch vinyl singles by
hopeful Jamaican reggae artists pour into the Queens warehouse of VP
Records, run by the Chin family. Over the last 25 years, Vincent and
Pat Chin, their four children and now an assortment of grandchildren
have been an important link between reggae and New York.</LD>
<LD>   Now the Chins are on the brink of something big. Media requests
for interviews are also pouring in every day. Various Chins are
photographed in this month's GQ magazine, even Chris, the shy son who
had to be chased around the warehouse before he would sit for the
picture. The company phone rings relentlessly. "Chris, line one.
Randy, line two. Is Miss Pat around?" an operator beckons. Two weeks
ago VP, a boutique in a universe of recording giants, signed a
multimillion-dollar partnership with one of the behemoths, Atlantic
Records. Some are comparing it to Columbia's 1985 marriage with
Russell Simmons' hip-hop powerhouse Def Jam Records.</LD>
<LD>   But this is not a story of another industry deal. This is about a
family that came to New York but never really left Jamaica; they
lived in both cultures and built their business with the best of both
worlds. In other words, this is the classic immigrant saga, updated.</LD>
<TE>   By running a business connected to the homeland and regularly
returning to Kingston, the Chins helped keep Jamaica's reggae alive
since Bob Marley made it an international sound in the 1970s. And as
that sound has faded, the Chins have helped popularize an up-tempo
strain of the music known as dancehall.</TE>
<TE>   How it began</TE>
<TE>   Vincent Chin broke into the music business 40 years ago selling
old jukebox records in Kingston. He and his wife, Pat, opened a
record store and then expanded into producing Jamaican music under
the label Randy's Records. Marley and lesser-known stars regularly
passed through their studio.</TE>
<TE>   In 1977, Vincent and his two oldest sons, Clive and Chris, came to
New York to move the family and the business, renamed VP Records.
Political unrest had driven them and many others from the Caribbean
to seek a better life. But they were as good for New York as New York
was for them. It was the arrival of the Chins and a million other
immigrants from all over the world that turned around the city, which
had just survived a brush with bankruptcy and was hemorrhaging
residents to the suburbs.</TE>
<TE>   By 1980, Pat also moved, with the two younger children, Randy and
Angela, to Jamaica, Queens. "I wish we could say it was a marketing
strategy to go from Jamaica to Jamaica," says Randy, "but it was a
coincidence."</TE>
<TE>   Here, the Chins had to persuade an industry that equated reggae
with Marley and only Marley (or maybe Peter Tosh) that a family of
Chinese-West Indian-Irish descent knew the loping music of the
islands. Certainly, they did not look the part. "My grandchildren
have so much different blood in them they hardly look like each
other, never mind other Jamaicans," says Miss Pat, as the tiny
matriarch is known.</TE>
<TE>   Over time, the Chins and VP Records became widely known in the
mom-and-pop record shops and dance clubs and radio stations around
New York's Caribbean neighborhoods. (Nearly 10% of Jamaica's
population -- 213,805 people -- left in the 1980s; most moved to New
York.) They produced major acts such as Shaggy, Super Cat, Shabba
Ranks and Beenie Man, as well as annual best-of-reggae albums. "The
music didn't leave Jamaica, but the family here made our music bigger
and wider and helped us find new regions," says saxophonist Dean
Fraser, a reggae graybeard visiting VP's warehouse last week to work
on a production deal.</TE>
<TE>   On any given day, the Chin family can be found in a sprawling
warehouse that abuts a McDonalds on (where else?) Jamaica Avenue. In
one cramped office, Joel, Clive's son, is listening to a CD recorded
by an up-and-coming dancehall act. Wearing a backward cap, Joel, who
is 26 and generously proportioned, rolls with the beat. He's got the
ear, so he scouts the talent, traveling to Jamaica almost monthly.</TE>
<TE>   A floor above, Randy, who is 40 and Joel's MBA uncle, is meeting
with the sales and marketing staff. He is wearing a Ralph Lauren
denim shirt. After working in California for a decade as an engineer
in the aerospace industry, he came back to the family business. He
negotiated the deal with Atlantic.</TE>
<TE>   Chris, 43, Randy's gangly, elusive older brother, wanders the
warrens of the warehouse quietly talking, sometimes in patois, to
producers, artists and the young promotion team. He has the important
role of hand-holder with the artists. He's also a peacemaker in a
family that, like all families, often needs one.</TE>
<TE>   Vincent, the patriarch, has retired in Miami, where his youngest
child, Angela, 38, runs a VP distribution center. Various other
grandchildren and in-laws also come around with opinions.</TE>
<TE>   But the biggest opinionator is Miss Pat, who is 65. She says, "I'm
just here to support everyone."</TE>
<TE>   Randy says otherwise: "She weighs in on everything."</TE>
<TE>   Mostly Miss Pat, who is supposedly semi-retired, works at VP's
record store a few miles away. But she regularly sweeps into the
warehouse carrying plastic bags filled with CDs and cookie tins.</TE>
<TE>   She cooks lunch -- last week it was curried shrimp and rice -- for
Randy, Chris, Joel and the staff and tries to get them all to eat
together in the lunchroom.</TE>
<TE>   This is often futile. The Chins are always moving in different
directions. Except when they come together to make the business work.</TE>
<TE>   Those who left</TE>
<TE>   While Chris and Miss Pat spent their early years here developing
hot acts, some left VP for major labels or just lost steam. Beenie
Man, for example, left two years ago for Virgin Records. But with
Randy's business acumen and Joel's ear for new artists, VP has been
trying to serve the talent better and remain relevant to younger
audiences.</TE>
<TE>   "Chris and I took the business as far we could, but now Randy and
Joel are lifting it to a new level," Miss Pat says.</TE>
<TE>   A few years ago, Joel was on one of his regular scouting trips to
Jamaica when he hooked up with Sean Paul, a handsome young dancehall
singer. That was a turning point for VP.</TE>
<TE>   Sean Paul now has a single, "Gimme the Light," at No. 8 on
Billboard's Hot 100 and No. 4 on the Hot Rap Tracks chart. The
success of his hip-hop-flavored reggae was the catalyst for VP's new
partnership with Atlantic.</TE>
<TE>   The Chins are eager to bring a new style of reggae music to the
mainstream but keep it authentic in the process. They have done this
as a family: Even while they are full-fledged New Yorkers -- living
in single-family houses on Long Island, sending their kids to public
schools and driving minivans -- their Jamaican roots remain strong.
The second generation has all married Jamaicans, mostly of Chinese
descent. And the company Christmas party is already planned this year
-- at a Jamaican restaurant in Manhattan.</TE>

<HD>His finest hour</HD>
<DH>Rejected many times as a novelist, prolific screenwriter
David Benioff has to get used to the word 'yes.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jeff Gottlieb</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>David Benioff once submitted a short story about a computer virus to
a well-regarded literary magazine. The editor wrote back, "You have a
bright future ... at Microsoft." Benioff didn't even bother sending
out his first novel. His second try was rejected by 34 publishers --
20 of them in a single day.</LD>
<LD>   He spent two years writing his next novel. Fourteen publishers
turned that one down. He found luck with the 15th, which offered him
a $7,500 advance -- not much, but at least it made him a published
novelist.</LD>
<LD>   These days, a $7,500 advance wouldn't even be a house payment for
the 32-year-old writer. Benioff has very quickly gone from a guy who
couldn't give his books away to one of the hottest screenwriters in
Hollywood, selling scripts for close to $2 million with myriad
filmmakers and studios bidding for his services. The first of his
films, the suspense drama "The 25th Hour," based on Benioff's novel
and screenplay and directed by Spike Lee, opens Dec. 19 in Los
Angeles and New York.</LD>
<TE>   Benioff's odyssey is the kind of true-life fairy tale that stokes
the dreams of striving writers. It's the kind of tale that's
particular to Hollywood, where success seems to feed on itself. In
the 2 1/2 years since Benioff sold "25th Hour" to Disney, he has cut
deals for five other screenplays and is on the verge of a sixth. He
is involved in projects with such well-known directors as Kimberly
Peirce ("Boys Don't Cry"), Marc Forster ("Monster's Ball"), Curtis
Hanson ("L.A. Confidential," "8 Mile") and Wolfgang Petersen ("The
Perfect Storm"). In the meantime, his literary ambitions have not
been forgotten: He has a contract for two novels and a collection of
short stories.</TE>
<TE>   After 10 years working as a disc jockey in Wyoming, a high school
teacher in Brooklyn and a bouncer in San Francisco, Benioff finds his
newfound fame and fortune sweet. "No doubt I'm a competitive guy,"
said Benioff, a former high school wrestler. "So many people say no
to you as a writer, and there are so few yeses. I hate losing."</TE>
<TE>   He used to live in an apartment in Santa Monica, next to a home
for emotionally troubled men. Not anymore. Seven months ago he moved
into a house with a swimming pool in Benedict Canyon where he lives
with his dog, a boxer named Murphy. He calls it "the house that
'Stay' bought," referring to the screenplay he sold for $1.8 million
that David Fincher ("Seven") has signed on to direct.</TE>
<TE>   Take a wrong step off the tiny patio of Benioff's home and you'll
slide into a ravine. Benioff points across the canyon to the frame of
a mansion that Microsoft founder Paul Allen is building and a house
with a Spanish tile roof that once belonged to Rudolph Valentino.
Benioff has turned a bedroom into his office, where he writes from 10
p.m. until 3 or 4 a.m. five days a week.  A poster of the Fellini
film "Notti di Cabiria" hangs above his desk. On the couch is a
present his grandmother made, a needlepoint-pillow version of the
cover of "25th Hour," showing a night scene on New York's East 14th
Street.</TE>
<TE>   Suddenly, Benioff has enough money to do just about anything he
wants. "I'm not neurotic about it," he said. "I love having money. I
love having a nice house. I get to live here and have a dog and look
at the canyon."</TE>
<TE>   Low key, with a dry sense of humor, Benioff still peppers his
conversation with literary references. He runs, lifts weights and
favors a hip, unshaven look (People magazine named him one of the
nation's 50 most eligible bachelors last year).</TE>
<TE>   Benioff's success isn't based on any proven track record in
Hollywood, so when "Stay" sold recently in a daylong auction, Variety
said the price "caused jaws to drop." Echoed the Hollywood Reporter:
"Indeed, when David Benioff's 'Stay' sold for $1.8 million this fall,
what generated talk wasn't its story line but the fact that anyone
was spending that kind of money at all."</TE>
<TE>   What seems to have impressed filmmakers and studio execs about
Benioff is his range, his ability to take on anything from a Greek
classic to a mystery and turn it into his own. Benioff's current
projects include:</TE>
<TE>   "Stay," to be directed by Fincher ("Panic Room"), a thriller about
a psychologist at an Ivy League college trying to prevent a student
from committing suicide.</TE>
<TE>   "Troy," a retelling of "The Iliad," to be directed by Petersen and
starring Brad Pitt as Achilles. Filming is expected to begin in
April.</TE>
<TE>   "Alpha," a military/political thriller that will be directed by
Forster. DreamWorks paid $1.25 million for the rights and will pay
$500,000 more if it's produced.</TE>
<TE>   An adaptation of George Pelecanos' mystery "Right as Rain," which
Hanson will direct. Benioff is receiving more than $1 million for his
script.</TE>
<TE>   A remake of "For Whom the Bell Tolls," based on Ernest Hemingway's
novel about the Spanish Civil War (the original starred Gary Cooper
and Ingrid Bergman), for which he will be paid more than $1 million.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Peirce and Benioff have teamed up for a screenplay
based on a true story about small-time New York gangster Chris
Paciello, who hooked up with Madonna pal Ingrid Casares to own two of
the hottest clubs in Miami Beach. They are currently negotiating with
DreamWorks.</TE>
<TE>   Peirce said she read several of Benioff's screenplays before
asking for a meeting, citing his ability to write small, intimate
movies like "25th Hour" and then turn around and create a picture on
a much grander scale.</TE>
<TE>   "He writes wonderful human characters you can identify with and
has wonderful structure," she said. "That combination is so rare in
screenwriting."</TE>
<TE>   To Jeff Robinov, president of domestic production for Warner
Bros., which has signed Benioff for two movies, Benioff's screenplays
"have heart and theme and great characters and real emotion, and he's
a good storyteller."</TE>
<TE>   A visit from Spider-Man</TE>
<TE>   Before his Hollywood journey began, Benioff was a self-described
"snotty New York novelist guy." He went to Dartmouth and received a
master's degree in Irish literature from Trinity College in Dublin,
where he wrote his thesis on Samuel Beckett. From there it was off to
UC Irvine for a master's degree in creative writing, where he wrote
"The 25th Hour" as his thesis.</TE>
<TE>   Living in Southern California, show-biz buzz was unavoidable. At
parties, he would tell people he was a writer. "Movies or TV?" they
would ask. When he said he was a novelist, they'd often reply,
"Fiction or nonfiction?" "It happened so often," Benioff recalled,
"it wasn't funny."</TE>
<TE>   He was teaching freshman composition at UCI to support himself
when, in 2000, Spider-Man himself swooped in.</TE>
<TE>   Tobey Maguire was looking for a film that he could not only star
in, but also make his debut as a producer. His management company
sent him a pre-publication version of "25th Hour." "I read it, and
really liked it a lot," Maguire said. "I told them definitely try to
get this thing." Benioff and Maguire met in a coffee shop on Sunset
Boulevard. Benioff decided that if someone were going to mess with
his book, it might as well be him.</TE>
<TE>   Maguire was skeptical that a novelist could turn out a usable
screenplay, but Benioff told him he didn't have much to lose giving
him first crack at the script -- he came cheap. All it cost was the
Writers Guild of America minimum, $62,000. But that was enough for
Benioff to quit teaching and devote himself full time to writing. The
first-time screenwriter had no trouble with the slash and burn so
often required to turn a book into a movie. "The book is out there as
my writing," Benioff said. "I don't need to be absolutely faithful. I
cut characters, I cut scenes. I was ruthless."</TE>
<TE>   Three months later, Benioff turned in his draft. "I was floored,"
Maguire said. "I remember reading it and talking to a couple other
people who were producers and saying, 'Wow, we don't need another
writer. This guy is the real deal.' "</TE>
<TE>   At the end of last year, Benioff's agent sent the script to Spike
Lee (the William Morris Agency represents both of them). "I thought
it was a very good story," said Lee. "I was thinking there were a lot
of good roles here that should be able to get a great ensemble cast."</TE>
<TE>   When Disney decided to back the film, Lee called Benioff. "Mickey
Mouse is doing our movie," he said. The $15-million film is being
distributed by Disney's Touchstone Pictures.</TE>
<TE>   "The 25th Hour" tells the story of dope dealer Monty Brogan's
(Edward Norton) last day of freedom before he heads to prison. He and
his best friends, bond trader Frank Slattery (Barry Pepper) and
teacher Jakob Elinsky (Philip Seymour Hoffman) follow him through
this journey. Monty tries to reconnect with his father, while
wondering if his girlfriend Naturelle (Rosario Dawson) is the one who
sold him out to police.</TE>
<TE>   Because of his "Spider-Man" commitments, Maguire dropped plans to
act in the movie. Norton took his place. The "25th Hour" screenplay
was passed around among directors and studio executives and became
Benioff's entree to Hollywood.</TE>
<TE>   The script got him a meeting with Robinov, then Warner Bros.
Pictures executive vice president. He pitched his idea for "The
Iliad." This was Benioff's first pitch meeting, and he went in with
more than a writer's usual insecurity. "Jeff's yawning as I'm giving
my pitch," he recalled. "He's bored. I'm inarticulate. He's going to
throw me out of the office. After five minutes, he looked like he was
ready to fall asleep."</TE>
<TE>   Benioff couldn't have been more wrong. "It was like he'd been
thinking about it for 20 years," Robinov said.</TE>
<TE>   Turns out, he'd been thinking about it even longer. When Benioff
was a little boy, his mother was bedridden with a bad back. Benioff
would sit with her while she read him "The Iliad." "Hearing it from
your mother when everything a mother says is so holy.... This was the
first time literature or art affected me emotionally. Hector and
Achilles resided in my mind from that point on as the epitome of
heroes. These were my superheroes."</TE>
<TE>   Ten days after the meeting, the deal for "Iliad" was cut. A couple
of weeks later, he sold "Stay" to Regency. Maguire had read the
script. "I couldn't believe it was by the same writer [as "25th
Hour"] because they're very, very different films in tone but with
great character work, great honesty," he said.</TE>
<TE>   After Benioff turned in his draft of "Troy," Robinov asked him
what he wanted to do next. "For Whom the Bell Tolls," he said. "It's
sort of this dream moment for a screenwriter. The head of a studio
saying, 'Pick your book.' "</TE>
<TE>   Even with studio executives asking for his services, Benioff
remains insecure. "I always dread I'll screw up," Benioff said. "I
think you can have some success, but you always know you're judged by
the last thing you write. If anything, it's more profound now. Before
there was very little to lose."</TE>

<HD>Cafe Tacuba, a bicultural dynamo</HD>
<DH>The alt-Latino band's music stretches from surreal and
sassy to sentimental and takes 'quirky' to new levels.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Agustin Gurza</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Cafe Tacuba, the revered and vaguely mysterious alt-Latino band, has
made just four full-length albums since it was founded 13 years ago
by design students in Mexico City. It now seems astounding that this
quirky quartet could compress such a rich and varied body of work
into a handful of releases.</LD>
<LD>   The band's frequently raucous -- and sometimes riveting -- concert
Friday at the Hollywood Palladium provided a sampler of its respected
repertoire, plus several new songs. After a two-year hiatus from
touring, this dynamic performance served as reminder of the power of
music that helped redefine pop culture in Latin America.</LD>
<LD>   Cafe Tacuba's original lineup is still intact -- Emmanuel del
Real, keyboards and programming; Joselo Rangel, guitar; his brother
Enrique Rangel, bass; and Ruben Albarran, the band's hyperkinetic
lead singer who changes his name with every album.</LD>
<TE>   Albarran, a.k.a. Anonimo and Cosme, emerged Friday as Gallo Gasss,
wearing a black ski mask with a rooster's comb dangling ridiculously
on top of his head. He's a sprightly spark-plug of a showman, hopping
and twirling with abandon like a punked-out Aztec dancer on
spring-loaded sneakers. It's a shame the subtleties of his vocals --
which range from a mocking whine to a clean falsetto and a tender
croon -- were often lost in a muddy mix.</TE>
<TE>   The Gallo Gasss character looks like an incongruous cross between
a Zapatista rebel and one of those masked Mexican wrestlers. As a
blend of comic books and social causes, he was a perfect centerpiece
for a band known for fusing seemingly unrelated cultural forces. Cafe
Tacuba's trademark ability to shift styles instantaneously, often
within the same song, was evident during its two-hour show, which
veered from new wave to nostalgia, from punk to polkas. The most
stirring moments came when exploring that explosive nexus where La
Raza meets rock 'n' roll, assisted on several stirring songs by
regular sidekick Alejandro Flores and his vibrant violin evoking
Veracruz.</TE>
<TE>   The crowd also breezed biculturally from mosh-pit frenzy to
old-fashioned folklorico steps. Many knew every word of the group's
surreal, sassy and sentimental Spanish lyrics. That's not easy on a
classic like "Chilanga Banda," with its hypnotic stream of street
slang delivered in the sing-song tone of Mexico City dwellers.</TE>
<TE>   Chilango, or chilanga, means someone or something from the Mexican
capital. That included most of the audience Friday, judging from the
response when Gallo Gasss mentioned that "Chilangos are everywhere."</TE>
<TE>   Cafe Tacuba makes no attempt to explain itself. That can be a
frustrating trait in a band with such high expectations. Three years
ago, when Warner Bros. decided to push the band in the U.S., Cafe
Tacuba dashed hopes for an alt-Latino breakthrough by delivering an
album of weird, experimental instrumentals titled by numbers, not
names. It eventually averted a debacle by producing a brilliant
second CD with actual songs, resulting in 1999's acclaimed double
album, "Reves/Yosoy." This year, instead of making a strong comeback
statement on its new label, MCA, the group released an enigmatic EP
covering four songs by the obscure and disbanded Chilean band Los
Tres. A full album of new material is due on MCA in the spring, but
making the short-form album seems like another careless or
ill-calculated career choice.</TE>
<TE>   Band members say they really don't care about anything but making
music they like. Yet Friday's far-from-capacity turnout shows they
haven't gained many new followers recently.</TE>
<TE>   Instead of singing for the choir, Cafe Tacuba should be seeking
converts outside the Church of Spanish Rock. The band certainly
deserves all the listeners it can bring to the fold.</TE>

<HD>Clarke punctuates bass-player lineup</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>don heckman</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Stanley Clarke's Web site, in a veritable orgy of multi-hyphenate
descriptiveness, identifies no fewer than eight career paths for the
bassist best known to jazz audiences as a principal member of the
group Return to Forever. For the record, the descriptive labels are
bassist, composer, conductor, orchestrator, arranger, songwriter,
record producer and recording artist.</LD>
<LD>   No wonder Clarke's appearances as merely a bass player and
bandleader (yet another career path) have become few and far between.
His one-night program at the Key Club on Saturday was the first local
club date under his own name in recent memory.</LD>
<LD>   And the most impressive aspect of his hour-plus set was the fact
that his extraordinarily virtuosic technical skills were as amazing
as ever, displayed in an on-the-spot seminar defining the almost
limitless potential of contemporary bass playing. In the opening
portion of his set, Clarke shared the spotlight with Cameroon's
Armand Sabal-Lecco in a sequence of spectacular electric bass
exchanges, whipping riffs back and forth, snapping the strings of
each other's instruments, generating waves of high-decibel sound and
rhythm.</LD>
<TE>   But Clarke was even more striking when he turned to his acoustic
bass. Reaching from his own "Song to John" (for John Coltrane) and
"School Days" to a spontaneous display of brilliant, fast-fingered
solo improvising, he repeatedly affirmed why, with the late Jaco
Pastorius, he is one of the primal godfathers of contemporary jazz
bass playing.</TE>
<TE>   That said, however, much of the set had the quality of a slam-dunk
contest rather than a cohesive musical game. Individual players --
Clarke, Sabal-Lecco, violinist Karen Briggs, keyboardists Nick Smith
and Mark Stephens, as well as horn players Bob McChesney, trombone;
Brandon Fields, saxophone; and Ron King, trumpet -- all displayed
their highflying, individual wares.</TE>
<TE>   What was missing was the sort of inter-creativity that made Return
to Forever such a musically rewarding ensemble. Obviously, it can be
tough to find time to make group togetherness happen when so many
other activities are calling.</TE>

<HD>The interrogation itself can be suspect</HD>
<DH>How timely that a worthy new TV movie shines a sweaty hot
light on interrogations just as the U.S. Supreme Court is poised to
reconsider its historic Miranda ruling requiring police to inform
those held for questioning that they have a right to remain silent.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The high court is scheduled to hear oral arguments Wednesday. That
evening, Court TV will present "The Interrogation of Michael Crowe,"
its movie reprising an actual murder case that found Escondido police
obtaining a videotaped confession from a vulnerable 14-year-old
suspect that appeared to have been coerced. Charges against him were
later dropped -- after he had spent seven months in jail.</LD>
<LD>   As the movie shows, officers did inform Michael of his Miranda
rights before he withered under psychological pressure and told them
he murdered his younger sister, Stephanie, in 1998. So the debate
over Miranda -- whose redefining some legal experts believe would
send a message to police that they could trample over rights -- does
not directly apply here.</LD>
<LD>   Where the movie does intersect with Miranda is on the broader
issue of police behavior, and whether authorities can be trusted to
do what's proper and in the public's interest when questioning
suspects.</LD>
<TE>   In Michael's case, apparently not after they become convinced that
he and two of his friends had collaborated in the knifing of
12-year-old Stephanie in her bedroom. And with young Canadian actor
Mark Rendall as Michael in this movie -- a forlorn, pathetic,
manipulated figure in jailhouse white while being pressed by police
to confess -- this meltdown of a youth is as painful as TV drama
gets.</TE>
<TE>   The Miranda case before the Supreme Court stems from an Oxnard
farm worker's suit against police for questioning him relentlessly as
he lay gravely wounded from their gunfire. With the Bush
administration on board as well, Oxnard police are expected to argue
to the high court that Miranda includes no "constitutional right to
be free of coercive interrogation," only the right not to have
incriminating statements used against suspects in court. For Michael,
coercion is the issue.</TE>
<TE>   The San Diego County sheriff declared him innocent after he
recanted his confession, and his family is suing police and
prosecutors for allegedly violating his civil rights while
questioning him.</TE>
<TE>   Here's the crux of this interesting, well-acted film written by
Alan Hines and directed by Don McBrearty: If his confession hadn't
been videotaped, Michael might still be in the slammer.</TE>
<TE>   Zigzagging emotions of interrogations have long fascinated
scenarists. These encounters have proved perfect for small-screen
intimacy, most notably in the 1990s in "Prime Suspect 2" on PBS, with
British copper Jane Tennison (Helen Mirren) sweet-talking a
confession from a dying murder suspect, and in NBC's "Homicide: Life
on the Street," when Bayliss (Kyle Secor) and Pembleton (Andre
Braugher) tried mightily to squeeze an admission from an old peddler
they believed guilty of murder. After trying 12 hours, they failed.</TE>
<TE>   When it comes to brilliant screen interrogations, though, "The
Prisoner" also merits a pedestal. Not the Patrick McGoohan TV series,
which was memorable for other reasons, but a 1955 movie of that title
starring two British actors, Alec Guinness as an admired cardinal
imprisoned in an unspecified country on a phony treason charge and
Jack Hawkins as the Marxist inquisitor who methodically breaks him
down.</TE>
<TE>   Drawn from a play by Bridget Boland, this superbly staged
psychological duel mimics novelist Arthur Koestler in showing that
just about anyone, however strong-willed, can be tied into knots
mentally by an interrogator skilled in the techniques of twisted
logic and mind bending.</TE>
<TE>   In "Darkness at Noon," Koestler writes of an aging Bolshevik's
total loss of perspective when grilled for long hours by authorities
in a new regime bent on erasing the old order much as the Kremlin
leader Stalin did in the late 1930s.</TE>
<TE>   At one point the exhausted Rubashov hears his interrogator's voice
above him and coming from every side of him as it hammers
"mercilessly on his aching skull."</TE>
<TE>   He ultimately capitulates, somehow persuaded that public
confession to imaginary crimes is the best last service he can do for
the communism he still cherishes.</TE>
<TE>   Flash forward. The chasm is not that wide between Koestler,
writing in 1940, and the aching skull of Michael Crowe in an earlier
Court TV documentary (featuring the actual videotape) and this movie
when, after being worn down by hours of questioning without a parent
or lawyer present, and being lied to and intimidated, he is convinced
by investigators that his interests are served by confession. Even
after he tells them his confession will be a lie.</TE>
<TE>   The movie also features good work by Ally Sheedy and Michael Riley
as Michael's parents and John Bourgeois as a lead detective.</TE>
<TE>   But there are nits to pick. It was Michael's grandmother (a
missing person here), not his father who discovered Stephanie's
bloody body. And the story loses steam as the closing credits draw
near.</TE>
<TE>   Burned into memory, though, is that image of a juvenile alone in
an alien environment while alternately being cajoled and bullied by
investigators claiming to be his pal. Although lying and manipulation
are accepted techniques in police interrogations, a line surely was
crossed here.</TE>
<TE>   The sheriff's department later replaced Escondido police on the
case, and scheduled for a January court date is a drifter who was
charged with Stephanie's murder after DNA connected blood on his
clothing with her blood.</TE>
<TE>   Whether even that erases the stain on Michael remains to be seen.</TE>

<HD>Niche networks break the mold</HD>
<DH>Sci Fi and Cartoon Network were once defined by their
reruns. But they've grown in 10 years. Witness the new Spielberg
venture.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Janice Rhoshalle Littlejohn</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When the Sci Fi network launched 10 years ago, it was best known for
airing endless reruns of "Battlestar Galactica," along with the
umpteenth TV airing of "Star Wars." Hard-core sci-fi geeks, it
seemed, had found a channel all for themselves. Around the same time,
Cartoon Network became the 24-hour hub for fans of nostalgia
cartoons, and nothing but. If Bugs was your boy, this channel was
your toon boon.</LD>
<LD>   So it went in the early '90s, when cable channels were launched
regularly, and the operating wisdom was that narrowcasting was the
way to success. After all, such early successes as ESPN, CNN and
Lifetime showed it was possible to be successful on cable targeting
sports fans, news junkies and women, respectively. But no longer. As
Sci Fi and Cartoon Network demonstrate on their decade anniversaries,
to thrive now, even the most targeted networks have to broaden their
perspectives and raise their ambitions.</LD>
<LD>   Sure enough, reruns of "Battlestar Galactica" -- a TV retread of
"Star Wars" and "Star Trek" -- are gone from Sci Fi, replaced by a
brand-new epic from none other than Steven Spielberg. The new
signature for the channel is tonight's debut of the 10-day, 20-hour,
three-generational family saga "Steven Spielberg's Taken," Sci Fi's
most adventurous programming attempt yet.</LD>
<TE>   With the filmmaker as one of the executive producers, "Dante's
Peak" screenwriter Leslie Bohem writing the script and some top film
and TV directors handling individual episodes, the series is an
ambitious undertaking with a darker, more sinister view of alien
visitations than Spielberg offered in either "Close Encounters of the
Third Kind" or "E.T."</TE>
<TE>   (Sci Fi hasn't entirely shed its early habits: The channel's other
signature at the moment, beyond "Taken," is marathon airings of "The
X-Files.")</TE>
<TE>   This year's other 10-year-old, Cartoon Network, also expanded
beyond simply recycling Turner Entertainment's catalog of vintage
cartoons. These days, it's as well known for original series,
including "Dexter's Laboratory" and "The Powerpuff Girls."</TE>
<TE>   Buoyed by a decade of growth from original programming and movies,
Sci Fi and Cartoon Network can celebrate their 10-year anniversaries
as shining stars among the top niche-targeted cable brands that have
learned the importance of creating original, signature programs.</TE>
<TE>   They are hardly the only channels to have learned that lesson.
Think of what "The Shield" has done for FX, "Real World" and "The
Osbournes" for MTV, "Emeril Live" for the Food Network (which
celebrates its 10th anniversary next year) or "South Park" for Comedy
Central.</TE>
<TE>   And there are more new channels on the way. As attendees will
learn at this week's Western Show: Broadband Plus in Anaheim, the
cable industry's largest trade show, 57 new networks are hoping to
launch within the next calendar year. The National Cable &amp;
Telecommunications Assn. notes such new aspirants as APE-TV
(Anthropology Programming and Entertainment), the Puppy Channel, the
Diversity Network and the Anti-Aging Network, three channels devoted
to martial arts and two to the United States military.</TE>
<TE>   All are hoping to benefit from the thirst for programming in the
500-channel broadband environment that is emerging.</TE>
<TE>   "There was a perception about the channel, that it was very geeky,
that it was a rerun channel and that it was for boys," says Sci Fi
President Bonnie Hammer, "but we did an awful lot of research and
found that there are so many women who are into science fiction. So
what I had to do was educate the population to the fact that science
fiction is much broader than you think."</TE>
<TE>   Buttressing the brand had been the goal for Hammer since she
assumed the top job in 2001, a banner year for Sci Fi, which reaches
80 million homes. The network had expanded its original series
programming with "The Chronicle," "Farscape," "Stargate SG-1" and the
miniseries "Frank Herbert's Dune," which won two Emmy Awards. By next
year, the channel will add a female-lead adventure series,
"Firestarter: Rekindled," a spinoff of its popular Stephen King
miniseries, and the half-hour animated "Tripping the Rift" to its
original series schedule.</TE>
<TE>   Tonight's debut of "Taken" has already proved to be a
word-of-mouth coup for the network. "We started what we call our
'chatter class screenings' last month," says Hammer, "and people have
been really surprised at the level and the quality. The reactions
have been: 'This is the kind of thing we would have expected to be on
HBO.' "</TE>
<TE>   Actually, the miniseries was never intended to air anywhere else,
says Darryl Frank, co-head of DreamWorks Television: "The genesis of
the project stemmed from a past friendship between Barry Diller
[chairman and chief executive of Vivendi Universal, which owns Sci
Fi] and Steven. Barry approached him and DreamWorks about doing
something for their channel."</TE>
<TE>   Cartoon Network entered the cable arena backed by the muscle of
Turner Entertainment (the AOL Time Warner division that owns the
channel) and its library of characters from Hanna Barbera, Warner
Bros.' Looney Tunes and MGM, which produced the Tom and Jerry series.
But the network, now in 81.1 million U.S. homes and 145 countries
worldwide, established itself with such series as "Dexter's
Laboratory," "Powerpuff Girls" and "Johnny Bravo."</TE>
<TE>   Cartoon Network has continued to add franchises, including
programming for adults, with such offerings as "Toonami," a
three-hour afternoon adventure series block; "Adult Swim," for adults
18 to 34; "Cartoon Cartoon Fridays"; and "Cartoon Theatre," a weekend
destination for animated features.</TE>
<TE>   Mike Lazzo, Cartoon Network's senior vice president of programming
and production, wants to avoid being too rigid in defining the
network. "If we start limiting things and have too many rules, then
we are behaving unlike cartoons, which tend to break rules."</TE>
<TE>   That's in line with its commitment to acquire young, fresh voices
to help create the channel's unfettered tone and to create
relationships with top design schools, such as CalArts design school
and the Rhode Island School of Design. The strategy proved successful
when the network hired young gun Genndy Tartakovsky to create
Cartoon's first original series, "Dexter's Laboratory."</TE>
<TE>   "With Cartoon Network, they were looking for more undiscovered
talent, people that may have had a hard time getting in," said
Tartakovsky, who debuted the four-time Emmy-nominated "Dexter's
Laboratory" on the channel in April 1996, guiding it to become one of
Cartoon Network's top-rated programs before he moved on to create his
follow-up series "Samurai Jack." "It became a great opportunity to do
something. And as I got into it, I realized that they were also
offering the creative freedom. They were letting the creators make
the shows."</TE>
<TE>   "That's why I've stayed here," adds Craig McCracken, creator of
the Emmy Award-winning original series "The Powerpuff Girls." "With a
bigger network, they have to make sure they hold on to their place on
the mountaintop and ... don't get pushed off, so there's less of a
desire to try new things. It's not about climbing up the hill and
enjoying the trip and seeing where it takes you."</TE>

<HD>Potter and Bond have plenty to be thankful for</HD>
<DH>'The Chamber of Secrets' and 'Die Another Day' lead the box
office over the Thanksgiving holiday.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Lorenza Munoz</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The boy wizard barely pulled his magic over the suave middle-aged spy
this weekend, with "Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets" bringing
in an estimated $32.2 million Friday through Sunday, squeaking ahead
of James Bond and "Die Another Day's" $31 million. However, when
Wednesday and Thanksgiving Day are included, "Die Another Day" edged
ahead with $46.3 million versus $45.8 million for "Potter."</LD>
<LD>   Both movies are going strong, with "Die Another Day" bringing in
$101.6 million in 10 days and "Harry Potter" running its total to
$200.2 million in its third weekend.</LD>
<LD>   Holiday moviegoing was dominated by family pictures such as
Disney's "The Santa Clause 2," which came in third with $12.3 million
for the three days. The Tim Allen comedy has brought in $113.9
million since its release five weeks ago. Disney's animated Wednesday
opener, "Treasure Planet," landed in the No. 4 position, with an
estimated $11.9 million over three days, and a five-day total of
$16.5 million. Sony's animated "Adam Sandler's Eight Crazy Nights"
rounded out the top five, grossing $10.1 million Friday to Sunday for
a five-day total of $15.1 million.</LD>
<TE>   Other debuts fared less well. Despite major publicity, aggressive
marketing and generally decent reviews, Steven Soderbergh's "Solaris"
struggled, coming in at No. 7 with $6.7 million. Since its Wednesday
bow, the film has collected an estimated $9.4 million on 2,406
screens. "Wes Craven Presents: They" got off to a less-than-scary
start with an estimated $5.7 million over three days for a five-day
total of $8 million.</TE>
<TE>   "Clearly the films already in the marketplace dominated the
weekend," said Paul Derga- rabedian of box-office tracking firm
Exhibitor Relations Inc. "None of the newcomers were able to
compete.... Thanksgiving weekend is one of the biggest family-going
weekends."</TE>
<TE>   Among the well-performing smaller movies, Friday opener
"Rabbit-Proof Fence," directed by Phillip Noyce, grossed $92,000 on
only nine screens. "The Quiet American," also directed by Noyce, rose
15% from its opening and took in $153,000 over the five-day period.
The well-reviewed film has taken in $277,447 in 10 days in an
Oscar-qualifying run in only six theaters.</TE>
<TE>   Michael Moore's bluntly witty examination of gun violence in
America, "Bowling for Columbine," pulled in $1.3 million over the
five-day period for a total of $11.9 million in five weeks.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike retail sales, which early reports have shown posting gains
over 2001, moviegoing was down slightly from last Thanksgiving. Over
the five days, the top 12 movies this year grossed an estimated
$196.1 million compared with $199.3 million for last year, down about
1%, according to Exhibitor Relations. "It's not a record-breaking
Thanksgiving weekend," noted Dergarabedian, who said Thanksgiving
2000 was the best to date, when the top 12 films grossed $245 million
over the five days. Family films "Dr. Seuss' How the Grinch Stole
Christmas," "Unbreakable," "102 Dalmatians" and "Rugrats in Paris:
The Movie" dominated that year, said Dergarabedian.</TE>

<HD>Bolshoi caught going through the motions</HD>
<DH>Some of the pitfalls linked to overly ambitious touring
schedules came back and bit the company in "La Bayadere."</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Dance can be the most volatile of performing arts, unpredictable,
evanescent and very, very accident prone -- with the just-concluded
engagement by the Bolshoi Ballet at the Orange County Performing Arts
Center offering an especially vivid example.</LD>
<LD>   In the celebrated "Kingdom of the Shades" entrance ensemble in "La
Bayadere," for instance, 32 women must move as one, and the degree of
unanimity changes at each performance. In Costa Mesa, corps cohesion
fell apart on Tuesday (the "Bayadere" opening night), pulled together
impressively on Wednesday, but by Saturday afternoon began to erode
again.</LD>
<LD>   The raggedness Tuesday is easy to explain: The Bolshoi had been
dancing other ballets in other cities on the tour and simply wasn't
ready to present another work in another town on another stage with
another orchestra.</LD>
<TE>   Pickup rehearsals are always part of a dancer's life, and the
Bolshoi simply needed more of them to look its best in Costa Mesa.</TE>
<TE>   Different sets of principal dancers can also transform a familiar
work within a run. In the legitimate theater, there's one first cast
and everyone else who turns up in a major role is labeled an
alternate, understudy or replacement.</TE>
<TE>   In ballet, however, dancers may be chosen for an opening night
because of seniority within the company or because other principals
are dancing other openings in other cities. The revelations often
come later.</TE>
<TE>   The six-performance Bolshoi engagement offered three slates of
principals, and only one of them, the Wednesday/Friday lineup, took
"La Bayadere" beyond mundane professionalism.</TE>
<TE>   On Saturday afternoon, for example, Anna Antonicheva and Sergei
Filin danced the leading roles for the first time in the engagement.
A tiny, skin-and-bones ballerina, Antonicheva successfully projected
lyric grace and expressive vulnerability, but brought no other
emotional colors to her performance and only a limited dynamic range
to the ballet's technical challenges. Without the speed, force and
majesty she needed in the last act, she couldn't even dominate the
"Shades" corps.</TE>
<TE>   Filin partnered her capably and displayed technical refinement and
very secure terminations in his solos. But his dancing never proved
remotely individual or passionate.</TE>
<TE>   And, with its hack music, kitsch-exoticism and melodramatic plot,
"La Bayadere" is a vehicle that demands more than well-schooled
anonymity to come alive.</TE>
<TE>   Fine dancers like Filin who take no chances and aim no higher than
a faceless proficiency may be responding to the institutional
instability that the Bolshoi has suffered for more than a decade. For
starters, a series of administrative upheavals established a
revolving door for artistic directors -- a different one on each of
the last four local visits.</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, the company's reputation in the U.S. became so tarnished
by a series of dreadful, unauthorized "Stars of the Bolshoi" tours in
the 1990s that two years ago American promoters insisted that
international star Nina Ananiashvili dance the leading role in every
ballet on every opening night in every tour city to assure quality
control and public confidence.</TE>
<TE>   Mission accomplished: The Bolshoi is once again a viable touring
franchise. But it would be exaggerating to say that the company's
purity of style in "La Bayadere" surpassed that of the Kirov Ballet
or the Paris Opera Ballet or even the Universal Ballet of Korea (run
by a former Kirov artistic director) in the same work on Southland
stages.</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, there are Bolshoi stars that Southern California has
never seen -- the luminous Svetlana Lunkina, for instance (who
reportedly does not dance "La Bayadere"), and the glamorous Anastasia
Volochkova (who reportedly does). These days, major ballet venues
must do more than merely sign companies -- they must sign all the
top-of-the-line artists who give those companies their star power in
their home cities.</TE>
<TE>   That's exactly what the L.A. Music Center did regarding the
American Ballet Theatre "Le Corsaire" earlier this year, and what the
Kodak Theatre did not do regarding the American Ballet Theatre
"Nutcracker" this week. The difference is palpable.</TE>
<TE>   Dance can be the most volatile of performing arts and that's what
keeps some of us coming back, over and over, even to works with
limited artistic compensations such as the Bolshoi "La Bayadere."</TE>
<TE>   But there's a limit. Stale repertory, lackluster casting and
debilitating tour conditions can make balletomanes feel like those 32
"Bayadere" shades: stone-cold dead, locked into a routine, headed
nowhere in particular.</TE>
<TE>   And you can bet that for every Bolshoi fanatic who yelled "bravo"
every time a dancer got a foot off the floor last week in Costa Mesa,
nine or 10 other ticket holders sat silently in their seats
wondering, "Is that all there is?"</TE>

<HD>'Sweets' is a nutritious, filling historical grab-bag</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Merle Rubin</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Once upon a prehistoric time, it wasn't easy to savor the pleasure of
intense sweetness unless you were lucky enough to live under a date
palm or willing to brave the wrath of the honeybee.</LD>
<LD>   Of course, sugar in its various forms (lactose, fructose, glucose
and sucrose) is an essential component of the human diet. It is part
of mother's milk and can be found almost everywhere in the vegetable
kingdom -- fruits, blades of grass and most vegetables -- albeit in
healthily modest quantities.</LD>
<LD>   The much sweeter form we commonly think of as sugar, the product
of sugar cane or sugar beets, became a dietary staple only in the
last three or four centuries. If we are instinctually programmed to
crave sweetness, it is an instinct that probably served us better in
the days before sugar was so instantly, concentratedly and
ubiquitously available in soft drinks, cookies, ice cream, cake and
candy.</LD>
<TE>   Candy is the form of sweetness closest to the heart of British
journalist Tim Richardson, the son of a dentist and grandson of a
toffee maker. Whether called "candy" by Americans or "sweets" by the
British, the category includes toffee, fudge, caramels, chocolates,
nougat, pralines, peanut brittle, marzipan, halwa, mints, pastilles,
licorice, lollipops, jelly babies, chewing gum and more.</TE>
<TE>   Richardson excludes cookies, cake, puddings and ice cream: along
with intense sweetness, the essence of candy is that you can eat it
as a snack between meals. Candy is (relatively) hard, with a high
concentration of sugar that makes it last indefinitely without
spoilage. But as Richardson repeatedly remarks in "Sweets," his
international candy-seeking odyssey, candy is even more irresistible
when it's freshly made.</TE>
<TE>   An unabashed candy-lover, Richardson waxes lyrical -- or perhaps
one should say "syrupy" -- at a whiff of roasting chocolate, the
taste of Turkish Delight or the mere idea of actually working at a
candy factory. He is also a staunch defender of candy, which he
believes has been unfairly demonized by certain nutritionists and
health-food advocates.</TE>
<TE>   Richardson concedes sugar may cause tooth decay, but so can
starch, which converts to sugar in the mouth. He would remind us that
fats are the culprits for heart disease and obesity, which means
(alas for chocoholics!) that chocolates (which contain fat as well as
sugar) are the more dangerous sort of candy. Yet, as Richardson also
shows, chocolate has nutritional value, not to mention the rich
complexity and nuances of its flavor and texture (its more than 1,200
chemical components make it a more complicated taste experience than
wine).</TE>
<TE>   Richardson would probably have been happier had he been born
during the Middle Ages or the Renaissance, when, as he tells us,
sugar was not only considered to be healthful, but also a medicine: a
cure for sore throats, indigestion, eye trouble and countless other
ailments. These were the times of preserves, pastilles, gums and
comfits, as fruits, seeds, flowers and roots were encased in sugar or
syrup to sweeten and preserve them.</TE>
<TE>   Far from supposing that preservatives were bad for you, earlier
ages arrived at the opposite conclusion, as reflected in this old
English proverb: "That which preserves Apples and Plumbs, Will also
preserve Liver and Lungs." Which only goes to demonstrate the
weaknesses of analogical thinking!</TE>
<TE>   But perhaps an even more appealing gastronomical "home" for
Richardson might have been India, the civilization that first
invented sweets: milk-based confections featuring countless
combinations of honey, sugar, syrup, rosewater, nuts, grains, flours,
spices. Curiously, while Indians were concocting one
milky-sweet-spicy delight after another, the other great and ancient
civilization to their north, China, exhibited very little interest in
sweets (or in milk products, for that matter). To this day,
Richardson informs us, Chinese "sweets," such as they are, taste
unpalatably sour to most outsiders.</TE>
<TE>   The Persians, the Arabs, the Armenians and the Turks also made
major contributions to the realm of sweets, including baklava,
candied citrus and sherbet. Nor does Richardson neglect the sweets of
the rest of the world, from Poland to the Philippines, from Russia to
Japan. Rather less interesting are his breathless accounts of his
visits to candy factories and candy-makers' trade shows.</TE>
<TE>   Although Richardson has an almost proselytizing passion for sweets
(he seems to love the cheap, nasty, mass-produced ones even more than
the voluptuous handmade variety), he takes due note of the
problematic relationship between sweets and slavery. In centuries
past, sugar cane was harvested by slaves.</TE>
<TE>   Nowadays, in cacao-growing places like Nigeria and the Ivory
Coast, he tells us, low "cacao prices and deregulation of the market
have made farmers unwilling or unable to pay their workforce, and
some of them have resorted to coercing children into slavery.... The
director of Mali's Save the Children Fund ... said: 'People who are
drinking cocoa or coffee are drinking their blood. It is the blood of
young children carrying six kilos of cacao sacks, so heavy that they
have wounds all over their shoulders.' "</TE>
<TE>   Still, as Richardson details, many of the best-known manufacturers
of chocolates -- Suchard of Switzerland, the Quaker-founded British
firms of Fry, Rowntree and Cadbury -- have a venerable history of
humanitarian concern for their labor force (Cadbury even established
a utopian village, far from the urban pollution, for them to
inhabit). Milton Hershey of Pennsylvania took a paternalistic
interest in his workers, and the Mars company is known for its
relatively egalitarian organizational style.</TE>
<TE>   For all its excessive enthusiasms and unresolved issues, "Sweets"
is an informative and generally entertaining grab-bag of personal
opinion, anecdote and culinary history.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>How did kids celebrate Christmas more than 100 years ago? Some things
have changed, but others have stayed the same.</LD>
<LD>   Families often made their own gifts. Girls might make their
brothers a bag to hold marbles. Boys may have been taught by their
mothers to sew a sachet (a small bag containing a perfumed powder to
scent clothes) for their sisters. These small gifts would have been
used as ornaments for the Christmas tree. Larger gifts were placed
under the tree as we do today. Children also made garlands from
berries, paper and popcorn to decorate the tree.</LD>
<LD>   The tree was usually decorated on Christmas Eve by parents and
older children. When Christmas morning arrived, families typically
had an early breakfast, usually hurried, so the children could see
the tree and open their presents before going to church.</LD>
<TE>   Boys enjoyed receiving toolboxes, boxing gloves, sleds, skates,
stamp albums, lanterns, jackknives, adventure books, cap pistols and
marbles.</TE>
<TE>   Little girls liked gifts that imitated those of their mothers and
older sisters: a party fan, a bit of jewelry, note paper with a
monogram (the initials of your name), books, perhaps a canary and
always a doll or two.</TE>
<TE>   You can learn more about how Christmas was celebrated more than
100 years ago at "A Southern California Christmas" at the Homestead
Museum on Sunday from 1 to 5 p.m. This free event will show you how
to make some of the items mentioned above along with many other
crafts. Free tours of the museum are also available throughout the
year, Wednesday through Sunday on the hour from 1 to 4 p.m. For more
information, call (626) 968-8492 or visit www.homestead museum.org.</TE>

<HD>Hello, Norma Jeane</HD>
<DH>A new coffee-table book packaged with the photographer's
diaries captures a pre-Hollywood Marilyn Monroe.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Susan King</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In 1945, a young Hungarian-born photographer named Andre de Dienes
was working in Hollywood and looking for young women to pose nude for
a project he was working on. He called Emmeline Snively, the head of
the Blue Book Model Agency at the Ambassador Hotel, to see if she had
anyone available. Snively suggested a 19-year-old by the name of
Norma Jeane Baker who had just entered the modeling field and was
waiting for her first assignment.</LD>
<LD>   When the woman who would shortly thereafter become Marilyn Monroe
arrived at his apartment later that day, De Dienes was instantly
smitten with the fresh-faced brunet. "It was as if a miracle had
happened to me," he wrote years later. "Norma Jeane seemed to be like
an angel. An earthly, sexy-looking angel! Sent expressly for me! As
minutes passed, I fell more and more in love with Norma Jeane; there
was an immediate rapport between us."</LD>
<LD>   De Dienes' remarkable collection of color and black-and-white
photographs of the budding sex symbol, as well as pictures he took of
her when she became the toast of Hollywood, are featured in the new
coffee-table book "Marilyn" (Taschen). The book, which, at $200,
comes in a replica of a Kodak film box, also includes the late De
Dienes' memoirs, complete with more photographs and contact sheets of
Monroe and reproductions of magazine covers he shot of her.</LD>
<TE>   "Everyone feels they know the Marilyn story, but Andre's diaries
are really interesting because they give a perspective that no one
has ever heard," says Steve Crist, who edited the book with the
photographer's widow, Shirley T. Ellis de Dienes.</TE>
<TE>   "She was 19 when they first met, and she was totally a different
person [than Marilyn Monroe]," Crist says. "Andre said over and over
in his diaries she was just a girl when he met her."</TE>
<TE>   In each photo of Norma Jeane -- whether frolicking at the beach or
cavorting in the mountains or even posing with ewes -- she is smiling
broadly, as if she doesn't have a care in the world. "You can see she
was a happy person, and we are not used to seeing that," Crist says.</TE>
<TE>   De Dienes and Monroe became lovers -- she was separated at the
time from her first husband, Jim Dougherty -- and the photographer
became obsessed with her. "He says that Marilyn at 19 had a certain
sophistication with men," Crist says. "She obviously had a real
attractive quality about her. She was literally chased by men.... One
thing that does come across is that she had this unique, mystical
kind of quality to her, and Andre fell under that spell."</TE>
<TE>   Though their love affair fell apart in 1946, De Dienes
photographed her over the years and, he wrote, she often would call
him out of the blue or show up unannounced at his house. The last
time he saw her was in 1961, a year before her death.</TE>
<TE>   "I think she really felt that Andre was one person who was a real
friend even though they had sporadic communication," Crist says. "I
think he was one of those special people in her life."</TE>
<TE>   De Dienes, who died of cancer in 1985, became somewhat of a
recluse in his later years. "The last 10 years of his life he wasn't
very active in terms of taking pictures or publishing," Crist says.
"He was much more inward, a total contrast to the early part of his
life where he was so much a world traveler and outgoing."</TE>

<HD>Turns out, De Niro is indeed a king of comedy</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU> Robert W. Welkos</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>With an uncanny ability to disappear into varied roles, Robert De
Niro has built a career as a serious actor, often playing frightening
and complex characters, whether it's a brooding young mafia don in
"The Godfather Part II" or a psychopath in "Cape Fear."</LD>
<LD>   Yet, early on, De Niro proved he also had uncanny comic timing
when he played the charmingly delusional fan pestering a popular
late-night talk show host (Jerry Lewis) in Martin Scorsese's
acclaimed 1983 black comedy, "The King of Comedy." In the 1988 hit
"Midnight Run," De Niro has a hilarious turn as a bounty hunter first
trying to capture and later trying to protect accountant Charles
Grodin.</LD>
<LD>   But it's only in recent years that De Niro's talent as a comedian
has rivaled the serious roles that made him an international movie
star.</LD>
<TE>   The turning point came in the 1999 gangland comedy, "Analyze
This," where De Niro plays mob boss Paul Vitti, who, suffering a
nervous breakdown, seeks counseling from a psychotherapist played by
Billy Crystal. Watching De Niro cock his head and wag his finger at
Crystal and tell him, "You, you ... you're good, you" had audiences
howling. The film grossed $106.7 million in North America.</TE>
<TE>   The next year, De Niro teamed with Ben Stiller in the blockbuster
comedy "Meet the Parents," which grossed $166.2 million. To be sure,
not all his comedies have been hits--witness "Showtime" with Eddie
Murphy ($37.9 million) and "The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle"
($26 million)--but De Niro has managed to cross over into comedy with
more success than most serious actors.</TE>
<TE>   This Friday, De Niro returns to the screen opposite Crystal in the
sequel, "Analyze That." This time around, mob boss Vitti, apparently
suffering a nervous breakdown, is released from prison into the
custody of his former psychotherapist.</TE>
<TE>   "De Niro has had a real renaissance in his career by doing
comedy," said Paul Dergarabedian, president of the box office
tracking firm Exhibitor Relations Co. "He has gained a whole new
generation of fans from people who would not necessarily want to see
his earlier films like 'Raging Bull' or 'Taxi Driver.' "</TE>

<HD>Diversity ... well, almost</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>Randy Lewis</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The annual KROQ Almost Acoustic Christmas shows, like their
summertime sibling the Weenie Roast, can function as a window on
trends in the modern-rock world, whether it's melodic punk-pop,
guitar-dominated garage rock or testosterone-laced rap-rock.</LD>
<LD>   So what can we glean from the lineups for this weekend's shows at
Universal Amphitheatre, which include Audioslave, Disturbed, New
Found Glory, P.O.D., Queens of the Stone Age and Zwan on Saturday,
with Beck, Coldplay, Creed, the Vines and Jack Johnson on Sunday?</LD>
<LD>   This year's trend appears to be the absence of a trend.</LD>
<TE>   "I don't think we're seeing any galvanizing music trend right
now," says Kevin Weatherly, vice president of programming at KROQ-FM
(106.7). "We're seeing all these different pockets of sounds that are
all doing well, all having fans. That's led to more diversity on the
station than there has been in a while."</TE>
<TE>   With one key exception, the mix is impressively broad, running
stylistically from garage rock (the Vines) to rap-rock (P.O.D.) to
hard rock (Queens of the Stone Age) to you-name-it (Beck), from big
names (Creed) to new bands with imposing pedigrees (Audioslave
consists of members of Soundgarden and Rage Against the Machine; Zwan
is Smashing Pumpkins' singer Billy Corgan's new band) to just
emerging (Good Charlotte, Taproot, Trust Co.).</TE>
<TE>   "Annually I think it's a pretty good showcase of what's around the
corner in terms of bands that are ready to break through," Weatherly
says.</TE>
<TE>   The one chink in the shows' diversity is the lack of female
performers.</TE>
<TE>   "This is one of those topics that for whatever reason seems to
come up year after year," Weatherly says. "We play the music our
audience wants to hear. We're certainly not opposed to playing women
on KROQ. We've been one of the champions of the Distillers and at the
same time one of the few alternative stations that still supports the
hometown favorites No Doubt," which played last year's Christmas
show.</TE>
<TE>   Because No Doubt and the Distillers played Southland shows
together recently, it might not make sense to include them this year,
but what about, say, the Donnas?</TE>
<TE>   Weatherly suggests it's a little too early in the rising
all-female punk-pop band's career, adding, "But who knows whether
they might be playing at this year's Weenie Roast? We would love to
have these things break out and work for us. We're looking for them."</TE>

<LD>So, Diane Sawyer did the impossible! She snagged Whitney Houston, and
you can see it for yourself Wednesday on ABC's "Primetime: Special
Edition." Sawyer says Houston addresses the widespread rumors of drug
use, her marriage, her relationship with Daddy and other problems.</LD>
<LD>   Sawyer asks the singer if, looking back, "Do you apologize?"
Houston answers: "Yeah, there are things I apologize for. Like
[canceled] concert dates. There was things I apologized for, because
the people really mattered to me. They mattered to me. And I know
they came out to see me. And I apologize for that. I'll make it up to
you. But that's the only people in the world -- the public, the fans
... that I apologize to. Because if I don't have my best to give,
then I can't give it to them. I want them to have the best of me."</LD>
<LD>   You were expecting maybe breast-beating, mea culpas, shocking
revelations? ... The Paltrows -- Blythe Danner, Gwyneth and Jake --
have sent out a wonderful thank-you card in remembrance of husband
and father Bruce, who died Oct. 2.</LD>
<TE>   Inside, it reads: "To honor Bruce. 1. Help someone -- he helped so
many. 2. Remember his quick wit, his irreverent good humor, his love
of family and friends. 3. Work on your golf game."</TE>

<HD>The harried blown away by ill wind</HD>
<DH>The Santa Anas always seem to leave folks frazzled with
flyaway hair and flake-away skin.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Mary McNamara and Hilary E. MacGregor</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Any decent writer who has spent time in Los Angeles has something to
say about the Santa Anas. Raymond Chandler probably put it best -- on
Santa Ana nights, "every booze party ends in a fight. Meek little
wives feel the edge of the carving knife and study their husbands'
necks" -- but Nathanael West and Joan Didion did OK too, the latter
filling pages of her Los Angeles notebook with observations about
"the wind that shows us how close to the edge we are."</LD>
<LD>   These folks, and many others, blame the Santa Anas for myriad ills
and occasions of mayhem, for fire and murder, car wrecks and
ill-tempered exchanges at the galleria. And few Angelenos would deny
feeling a bit odd during the weeks when the sky is scoured
mercilessly clear and dust chokes every corner of the house.</LD>
<LD>   But the bad behavior is not because of the wind, it's because of
the hair.</LD>
<TE>   There is nothing worse than Santa Ana hair. Ringlets unravel,
waves go dead calm, fluffy bangs dangle into sun-squinting eyes and
folks with naturally straight fine hair look like they've stuck a
finger in an electric socket. Conditioners make it worse, gel makes
it wet, and most of us don't have the chutzpah to wear a cloche or a
pillbox to the office.</TE>
<TE>   So essentially, you're looking at 16 million people, many with
self-image and anger-management issues to begin with, sharing a bad
hair month. And just in time for the holidays.</TE>
<TE>   Really, it's a miracle any of us are still alive.</TE>
<TE>   Women rush to their local salons, where even the most
sophisticated tress technician can do little but shrug and hand them
a scrunchy.</TE>
<TE>   "These are the days you definitely put your hair up," says Antonia
Hillard, who runs Antonia's in Beverly Hills. "Don't wash it. This is
the time you really work those French twists, those ponytails, those
hair ornaments you never use."</TE>
<TE>   Just what a 45-year-old bank executive wants to hear -- work that
ponytail.</TE>
<TE>   If the women resignedly start reaching for the hair clips in early
November, the men who slide into Joe Torrenueva's chair at Torrenueva
of Beverly Hills, are inevitably baffled. "I have [male] clients come
in and say, 'What the heck is going on?' I say, 'It's the winds.' I
put on a little bit of gel and a tiny bit of hairspray." For men with
comb-overs, the solution is even simpler. "They just pray," he says.</TE>
<TE>   "I've seen people on the street corners and their hair is
literally crackling," says Stuart Galvert of Galvert Atelier. "We
hear a lot of people complaining about the devil winds. We also have
people who are happy about it."</TE>
<TE>   Who?</TE>
<TE>   "Those with curly hair that tends to frizz, they get a blow dry
and it lasts four days."</TE>
<TE>   But even those among the fortunate few not afflicted by Santa Ana
hair are stuck with Santa Ana skin. Consider the effect Chandler's
"red wind" has on the local flora. It sucks every bit of moisture
from trees and brush and the next thing you know Malibu and the
Verdugo Hills are on fire. Again. If that's what happens to a
eucalyptus grove, just imagine the effect on the more delicate
flowers among us.</TE>
<TE>   Legs itch, faces feel tight and old, lips are constantly dry, and
the skin beneath many wedding rings is suddenly irritated in what
could be considered a dangerously symbolic way. Perfume evaporates in
the time it takes to walk to the office from the car, lipstick
disappears in an hour, and desks are suddenly cluttered with tins of
Bag Balm and bottles of Corn Huskers Lotion.</TE>
<TE>   "I've had a lot more people in talking about fine lines," says
Rebecca Carey, who works at the Clinique counter of the Glendale
Galleria Macy's. "People always start upping their moisturizers this
time of year."</TE>
<TE>   Yes, she adds, they're moving a lot of Definitely Different
Moisturizer in the really big bottles, but the hottest sellers are a
product called Moisture Surge Extra -- Moisture Surge, don't you feel
better just hearing it? -- and, of course, their anti-aging serum.</TE>
<TE>   But Carey isn't sure the Santa Anas are solely to blame for the
problem. "I think people are feeling very stressed because of the
economy," she says. "And when people are stressed, their skin is
stressed."</TE>
<TE>   Which is a rather discouraging thought. The Santa Anas may be
maddening to live through, but they do tidy up the skyline and make
the sunsets lovely. And more important, they almost always blow
themselves out by Christmas.</TE>

<HD>They're empty, but full of promise</HD>
<DH>Renting out vacant buildings as film locations can fill the
needs of owners, production companies and the community.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Michael Mallory</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In most cities, an empty building is an eyesore, a sign of economic
blight, possibly even a danger to the public. In Los Angeles and
environs, however, it can be a source of capital to the owners and a
boon to film producers.</LD>
<LD>   Such is the case with an empty Sumitomo Bank branch in Gardena,
whose vault is still, in a sense, protecting the building's assets.
Studio crews would be foolish to try to replicate on a soundstage the
size, weight, mechanical intricacy and sense of impregnability of the
vault door. So they come to the real thing.</LD>
<LD>   "Banks are always used in films, and it's hard to get operating
banks to allow filming," says Joseph Darrell, owner of Film Friendly
Locations, which represents the former Sumitomo Bank that has
welcomed crews from, among other shows, "Robbery Homicide Division"
and the recently axed "Push, Nevada." The massive vault, he says, is
one of the only ones in the area open for filming.</LD>
<TE>   Film Friendly Locations -- which lists everything from a downtown
L.A. storefront to a castle with a moat -- is one of a small group of
companies that represent properties in Southern California for use as
film sets. Many remain inhabited, but for the so-called dead
properties, those sitting unused, film location rent is owners' only
source of income to offset the costs of mortgages, maintenance, taxes
and utilities.</TE>
<TE>   Although shooting on location is hardly a novelty, using empty
commercial buildings for filming does address two ongoing, hot-button
issues in L.A.: land use and building preservation and keeping
production from leaving town to save a buck.</TE>
<TE>   Just how much can be saved by filming in empty buildings, as
opposed to renting soundstage facilities, is hard to say, because so
many variables are involved, including the type of production and its
budget. "Prices on the properties run in accordance with the size of
the [building], the kind of use and the number of prep days," Darrell
says. "If it's multiple shoot days and prep days, we discount it
somewhat because we're getting many days' work."</TE>
<TE>   On average, though, a commercial building might be rented out for
$2,500 to $4,000 a day for the actual shoot, and less for prep and
strike days, with the production company bringing in its own
electrical and lighting packages and handling the permits and
transportation. That is commensurate with the cost of renting four
dark, empty walls of a soundstage, but is perhaps one-third the day
rate for a back-lot location and one-fifth the tab for a fully
equipped stage with power, a lighting package and a crew.</TE>
<TE>   Darrell -- a lifelong Angeleno and former rock musician, actor,
unit production manager and photographer -- got into the location
business about eight years ago as a result of trying to help out a
friend with an office building in Hollywood that suffered from low
occupancy.</TE>
<TE>   "I figured if I could put production into this building at the
corner of Hollywood and Cahuenga, people would want to be around
where the production is," he says. "I started bringing production
into the building and eight years later the building is full" --
except for the former bank space on the ground floor, which is still
rented out for shoots.</TE>
<TE>   Beyond cost considerations, the quest for the right look draws
location managers and art directors to a specific location.</TE>
<TE>   "Studios do not have much personality to them, and you have to go
in and build," says Peg Meehan, owner of the Silver Lake-based Unreel
Locations. "Usually, people come to us because they like certain
architectural features."</TE>
<TE>   For the Coen brothers film "The Man Who Wasn't There," a complete
1940s department store was needed for interior and exterior shots.
The ideal site was found in the vacant Seeley Furniture store in
Glendale, a property Meehan says she discovered almost by accident.</TE>
<TE>   "I stopped by for the liquidation sale to buy some furniture, and
looked around at the high ceilings and interesting architectural
features," she says. "So as I'm paying for my sofa, I said, 'By the
way, what's happening with this building after you close?' That's how
we got going."</TE>
<TE>   The Seeley complex -- which includes two showrooms and a brick
warehouse with trussed ceilings -- has become a mini-studio in
itself. In the three years since the owners moved out, the buildings
have been refitted to represent a Staples store for a commercial, an
auto showroom, a nightclub, even a Buddhist martial arts temple --
almost everything except a furniture store.</TE>
<TE>   Likewise, the venerable Little Joe's Restaurant in Chinatown,
which has stood vacant for more than three years, has been used for
everything from a hotel to a prison in a Third World country.</TE>
<TE>   "Little Joe's has things that aren't necessarily Southern
Californian," Meehan says. "It is numerous buildings put together,
and the original building was a market with a basement to keep the
produce cold, a basement with 12-foot ceilings and arches that date
back to the late 1880s. The bar area is dark wood, and it looks sort
of Chicago or New York, so instead of flying to Chicago or New York
for filming, [filmmakers] can come here and get that feel of the old
bar with the red booths."</TE>
<TE>   Meehan got a taste of the location-filming business while working
as operations manager for Bullock's Wilshire and I. Magnin department
stores and overseeing shoots in stores that had been closed to the
public. After getting a real estate broker's license, she started
Unreel Locations in 1995 and began specializing in representing
historic properties, making sure that the income earned from use of
the buildings goes back into maintenance or construction.</TE>
<TE>   "It is costly to maintain all those unglamorous things like the
plumbing, the electrical, the earthquake reinforcement and the
foundation," she says.</TE>
<TE>   Even some of the city's bona fide architectural landmarks have
been opened up for filming, and not just the familiar ones, such as
Union Station or the Bradbury Building in downtown L.A. Meehan
handles the Ennis Brown House, the noted Frank Lloyd Wright edifice
in the foothills of Griffith Park, and the Doheny mansion in the West
Adams district (not to be confused with the Beverly Hills Doheny
mansion, better known as Greystone, which has been used as a film
location since the 1940s). Filming in the former is limited to a
minimum, Meehan says, to save wear and tear on the house and the
neighbors' nerves.</TE>
<TE>   Among the most notable empty historic buildings in Los Angeles is
the 90-year-old Herald Examiner building designed by Julia Morgan for
William Randolph Hearst. It's available for filming through Hollywood
Locations, which despite the name specializes in commercial
properties in downtown L.A. Formed in 1989 by onetime location
manager Brian Brosnan and Christopher Ursitti, Hollywood Locations
snapped up representation of the building after the newspaper ceased
publication. (In 1999 the company came to represent the ultimate
Morgan-Hearst collaboration, Hearst Castle in San Simeon.)</TE>
<TE>   In addition to the empty newsrooms, the building houses sets left
by previous productions -- a police station, a jail, a courtroom,
even a bar. But most production designers are loath to use an
unaltered set built by someone else, according to marketing director
Chris Catalfamo, unless production is already on site and discovers
something that can be used. Network TV shows that have filmed in the
landmark building include "CSI," "JAG" and the new "Dragnet."</TE>
<TE>   Hollywood Locations also is a partner in the Los Angeles Center
Studios complex, a full-service, six-stage production facility in the
former Unocal headquarters downtown. But it also represents major
downtown high-rises, offering lobbies (which can go for a day rate of
up to $10,000), rooftops, office suites or entire floors that have
been vacated by tenants.</TE>
<TE>   Fluctuating availability forces location representatives to stay
on top of the market as diligently as commercial real estate agents.
"You lose tenants all the time," Catalfamo says. A case in point is
the old Robinsons-May store at 7th Street between Grand and Hope,
which became a frequently used filming location after the store
closed.</TE>
<TE>   "The ground floor had been redone about six years before it
closed, so it looked fairly modern," Catalfamo says. "It was perfect
for commercials because it was empty. JCPenney loved it and they were
continually filming there for weeks at a time." The last time the
production company handling the JCPenney account called to book the
site, however, the building had been sold. A Rite Aid store now
occupies part of the space.</TE>
<TE>   Producers and location managers are well aware that's part of the
deal. "All production knows that as long as it's available to shoot
in, it's available to shoot in," Darrell says. "The property manager
or owner is of course looking for a long-term, three- to five-year
deal, and when something shows up, I'm out of it."</TE>
<TE>   Similarly, potentially long-term film rental deals can suddenly go
south, as was the case with "Push, Nevada," which found its locations
but failed to scout an audience.</TE>
<TE>   Although the work of location service representatives such as
Darrell, Meehan and Catalfamo exists mostly in a realm of industry
insiders, having a property listed as a potential film location is
one of the only aspects of filmmaking open to anyone who is
interested.</TE>
<TE>   "In Los Angeles, it's an opportunity that's there," Meehan says.
"Filming is a wonderful way for property owners to get income from
their property, and if it's done correctly," she emphasizes, "it can
be a very, very good experience."</TE>

<HD>Variations on a commercial theme</HD>
<DH>Dave Muller honors his friends and celebrates intimacy in
works on display at the Hammer.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>David Pagel</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It's easy to tell the difference between art and advertising.
Advertisements are designed to sell stuff and art isn't.</LD>
<LD>   But that doesn't mean that art doesn't have anything to do with
advertising. In a sense, art is an ad for itself -- an attractive,
often dazzling demonstration of what the world would look like if an
artist made it over in his own image.</LD>
<LD>   At the UCLA Hammer Museum, that's exactly what Dave Muller has
done in a deliciously idiosyncratic exhibition of almost 200
poster-size watercolors, several sculptures that look like shipping
crates and a bit of ephemera arranged around a sofa and coffee table.
Organized by Bard College's Center for Curatorial Studies Museum in
Annandale-on-Hudson, N.Y., "Dave Muller: Connections" is filled with
works that hide their wild ambitions behind the casual demeanor of a
seasoned do-it-yourselfer. The 39-year-old L.A. artist does not just
make a name for himself: He makes the world safe for himself and his
view of it by making art out of advertising and advertising out of
art.</LD>
<TE>   In 1994, a year after Muller graduated from the California
Institute of the Arts with a master's degree, he painted a watercolor
that looks like an oversize postcard advertising Andrea Bowers' solo
show at Bliss, an artist-run gallery in a house in Pasadena. Titled
"Damaged Goods," Bowers' exhibition included valuable artifacts and
irreplaceable objects damaged in the Northridge earthquake.</TE>
<TE>   Muller's work on paper features a close-up of a cut-glass
chandelier, beneath which are written, in elegant script, the show's
dates and the gallery's hours, address and phone number. True to the
spirit of Bowers' art, Muller has painted his homemade poster on a
sheet of paper whose right edge has a bite-size chunk torn from it.
His damaged advertisement simultaneously imitates ordinary exhibition
announcements and the works in the show.</TE>
<TE>   The majority of Muller's pieces are variations on this theme. In
each, he juxtaposes accurate information about actual exhibitions
with beautifully painted images of his own. His compositions are
always top-notch. And the pictures he invents to advertise and
commemorate his friends' shows are devilishly clever.</TE>
<TE>   For example, two watercolors based on Carter Potter's exhibition
at Angles Gallery from Dec. 8, 1994, to Jan. 3, 1995, play off of the
fact that Potter makes surrogate paintings by weaving together
discarded strips of 16- and 35-millimeter film. Using the grid formed
by the horizontal and vertical strips of film in the manner of an
open-ended crossword puzzle, Muller has filled in its squares with
letters that spell Potter's name if you read diagonally and nonsense
if you read across and down. Weaving his own work into the pattern
established by Potter, Muller invites viewers to go against the grain
of our ordinary visual -- and intellectual -- habits.</TE>
<TE>   While making his signature ads for other artists' shows, Muller
also ran Three Day Weekend, a series of sporadic group exhibitions
that began when he tidied up his downtown studio and invited artists
whose work interested him to install their pieces over holiday
weekends. Drinks were served and Muller, who is also a DJ, spun
discs. Between 1994 and 2001, he organized 50 of these events, taking
the freewheeling show on the road to galleries and alternative spaces
in Houston, Vienna, Tokyo, London and Frankfurt. His hand-painted
posters for these quick exhibits, all of which begin, "Three Day
Weekend presents..." are among his most elaborately composed and
graphically sophisticated.</TE>
<TE>   In 1998, Muller expanded his role of art (and party) promoter to
include the duties of critic and commentator. Two watercolors based
on a dismissive New York Times review of an exhibition by Sam Durant
mimic the format of a before-and-after advertisement. The first
dutifully reproduces the compact critique. The second is a loopy
love-poem that takes the format of a ransom note or punk album cover.
Turning the critic's words against themselves, Muller's repaired
review talks back to authority by taking power into its own hands,
playfully and pointedly.</TE>
<TE>   Other works reveal that Muller finds his heroes, and inspiration,
in out-of-the-way places. A diptych and a double diptych from 1998
sketch a scene in which Walter Hopps traces a Morandi drawing for an
exhibition advertisement. This tidbit of history provides a toehold
for Muller, whose oeuvre does something similar.</TE>
<TE>   His sculptures redeem fakery with a fan's enthusiasm.
Unceremoniously deposited in the middle of the floor, they are
indistinguishable from real shipping crates, complete with stenciled
warnings, handwritten messages and customs forms that identify the
contents as sculptures by little-known Romanian-born artist Andre
Cadere. Cadere painted pole-shaped sculptures and surreptitiously
installed them in other artists' shows as well as in museums whose
curators hadn't thought to include them -- or had decided not to.</TE>
<TE>   No gate-crasher himself, Muller turns Cadere's insouciant spirit
into the basis for his own aesthetic universe. Embracing an
all-American ethos of pulling yourself up by the bootstraps, his
works do not stand back and offer detached commentaries on
high-profile art-world events. Instead, they roll up their
metaphorical sleeves and leap into the messy tangle of art, commerce
and life, where real risks are taken and substantial pleasures
delivered.</TE>
<TE>   Over the last four years Muller's works have branched out to
include multi-page, installation-scale watercolor pieces in which
fine art and everyday life overlap with such ease and elegance that
it's hard to image them existing apart from each other. The newest of
these, which features a dreamy, day-after-the-rain view of Los
Angeles, is on view at Blum and Poe Gallery in Santa Monica. Similar
views of New York and Berlin are at the Hammer.</TE>
<TE>   In a suite of four comic strip-style images from 1999, Muller
links Jackson Pollock and Charlie Brown, demonstrating that the
spirit with which something is done is more important than the job
itself.</TE>
<TE>   In an ongoing series begun in 2000, Andy Warhol and Calvin (from
"Calvin and Hobbes") behave similarly, offering their own
unauthorized critiques of established authorities.</TE>
<TE>   Contrary to what curator Amada Cruz claims in the nicely
illustrated catalog that accompanies the Hammer show, Muller's
watercolors are not a critique of art found in museums or a mockery
of the mass-produced announcements commercial galleries regularly
send out. Instead, Muller's art is a critique of big-budget
institutions that use art as an advertisement for themselves to get
larger audiences and a larger take at the gate. In contrast, his
densely textured works celebrate the organic, hands-on quality of a
life in the arts, where intimacy and passion take the place of
grandeur and solemnity.</TE>

<HD>Vivaldi, seasoned with fine solo work</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Chris Pasles</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Vivaldi may be the composer most vulnerable to being
mischaracterized. Yes, "The Four Seasons" is a series of violin
concertos, and, yes, each concerto is made up of three movements.</LD>
<LD>   But anyone at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion on Friday night
quickly realized the significance of the secondary solo parts --
whether other violins, viola or cello -- in their varied, evergreen
interactions with the prominent soloists. Moreover, almost every
movement contains divisions and excursions that immeasurably deepen
Vivaldi's apparent economy of means.</LD>
<LD>   All this was especially evident as four orchestra violinists
sequentially took the limelight with a buoyant, scaled-down ensemble
under the direction of Miguel Harth-Bedoya. Michele Bovyer brought a
rich and burnished polish to Spring. Akiko Tarumoto spun out long,
limpid lines in Summer. Stacy Wetzel made Autumn a springy, elated
celebration, while Jonathan Wei turned Winter into a brilliant tour
de force.</LD>
<TE>   Vivaldi shared the program -- part of the Los Angeles
Philharmonic's Casual Friday series -- with Respighi. The composer
may have bitten off more than he could chew in his "Roman Festivals,"
a cinematic cultural history of the Eternal City, beginning with
pagan Rome and ending in the late 1920s.</TE>
<TE>   In powerfully evoking the soul-sickening blood guilt of events in
the Circus Maximus, Respighi laid down the need for the weary
struggle toward expiation in the next movement, "The Jubilee." Yet he
could not obliterate it, for all his efforts in the bounty of Nature
in "October Festivals" or the party-time hysteria of "Epiphany."</TE>
<TE>   Harth-Bedoya led the orchestra resourcefully, but Respighi, to his
credit, could not shake his vision of Rome as -- to appropriate
Athanael's line about Alexandria in Massenet's "Thais" -- that
"terrible city."</TE>

<HD>Serving slapstick in 'Cookin''</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Don Shirley</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Some entertainments give you everything but the kitchen sink.
"Cookin' " starts with the kitchen sink.</LD>
<LD>   Seen at Cerritos Center over the weekend, "Cookin' " capitalizes
on something interior designers have known for decades -- that people
like to think they can get a glimpse behind the scenes of a fancy
restaurant.</LD>
<LD>   "Cookin' " turns that glimpse into a slapstick-saturated, rock 'n'
roll-fueled fantasy and puts it on a stage, eliminating the expense
and bother of actually feeding the customers.</LD>
<TE>   It's a Korean production, conceived by Seung Whan Song. But
non-Korean-speaking audiences need not be intimidated. The few words
that are spoken are primarily in English. And the evening begins with
a set of amusing titles on a backdrop in English and Korean.</TE>
<TE>   We learn that the Korean title of the show, "Nanta," means "crazy
beat." We are advised against "trying this at home." A wedding is
about to take place, we are told, and a projected image of a "friend
of the bride" is none other than Bill Clinton.</TE>
<TE>   A burst of fog then ushers in four shadowy figures who are
drumming in the "Samulnori" style, a modern Korean idiom descended
from the traditional "Nong-ak" genre of rural Korean music. Or so
it's explained in a program note.</TE>
<TE>   Within minutes, however, the drums rise and disappear above the
stage, replaced by kitchen utensils. The music acquires rockier
inflections. The drummers finally become fully visible, clad in
chef-style whites.</TE>
<TE>   We're supposedly in the kitchen of a Korean restaurant. The stern
manager (Seoung Soo Yoo), vainly fussing with his hair at every
possible opportunity, instructs his staff that they have a little
more than an hour to prepare a lavish wedding feast. Throughout the
evening, a clock at the side prominently displays how much time is
left.</TE>
<TE>   The Head Chef (Sung Woo Choi) is assisted by Sexy Food Dude (Hyung
Seock Jung) and Female Cook (Hyun Jin Lee). But then an additional
helper is thrust upon them by the manager -- it's his nephew (Young
Hoon Kim). The nephew and Sexy Food Dude initially tussle over who
gets to wear a cook's hat and who gets a baseball cap. Later they
compete for the attentions of Female Cook, a dispute that culminates
in a kung fu-style showdown.</TE>
<TE>   The plot is a pretext, however, for the percussion, the juggling
and, well, the food fight.</TE>
<TE>   Much of the time, "Cookin' " is Korea's answer to "Stomp" -- an
extravagant display of the use of everyday objects as percussion
instruments. Pots, pans, cutting boards, knives, trash cans, brooms
and chopsticks help keep the beat.</TE>
<TE>   The rest of the time, "Cookin' " is virtually vaudevillian in its
comic rhythms. There is a fly-in-the-soup routine. A prop duck,
intended as the main course, seemingly will not die until the petite
Female Cook hauls out a machine gun. Plates are juggled. Food is
hurled.</TE>
<TE>   The audience is invited into the action. The cast selects a man
and a woman to serve as soup tasters and as a faux groom and bride.
The pressure of the plot's "deadline" is forgotten during a sequence
in which the audience is split into two parts for some rhythmic
clapping and stomping.</TE>
<TE>   A consultant from Benihana, the Japanese restaurant chain, helped
train the cast. But one of the concluding scenes is more reminiscent
of Chuck E. Cheese, as the cast tosses brightly colored balls into
the crowd. The kids in the audience appeared to have a great time.</TE>
<TE>   The performers are slim and animated. Director Chul Ki Choi and
composer Dong Jun Lee keep the pace up though 90 intermissionless
minutes, and Hak Youg Kim's lighting is reminiscent of a rock
concert. "Cookin' " is shallow, gaudy -- and fun.</TE>

<AU>E.G. Walker</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>I'm David Dreidel and I can hear my family singing my song:</LD>
<LD>   I have a little dreidel.</LD>
<LD>   I made it out of clay.</LD>
<TE>   And when it's dry and ready</TE>
<TE>   Then dreidel I shall play.</TE>
<TE>   This is exciting. It must be the festival of Hanukkah and
someone's coming for me. The lid on my box is opening. I haven't seen
the light of day -- maybe I should say the lights of the candles --
since last Hanukkah.</TE>
<TE>   "Here it is, Joey. Here's the dreidel."</TE>
<TE>   That's Simon speaking. Last year, after they finished lighting the
candles on the eighth day of Hanukkah, Simon put me in my special
box. It's a warm wooden box. I'm also made of wood, not clay like in
the song. I'm truly handsome, carved and polished. I'm made with four
sides. I narrow at the bottom to the spinner part. I have a stem on
top.</TE>
<TE>   More important, I have Hebrew letters stamped on each of my four
sides. They tell the players what to do. Simon and Joey like to play
dreidel and use walnuts for tokens.</TE>
<TE>   "I'll show you how to spin the dreidel," Simon says.</TE>
<TE>   "I remember how. Let me try."</TE>
<TE>   Yeah, I remember too how he did it. One year, Joey twirled me so
hard, I went under the couch. They didn't find me until they cleaned
for Passover in the spring. I hope he does better this year.</TE>
<TE>   Tuesday: Will Joey and Simon go easy on David Dreidel this year?</TE>
<TE>   Author's note: A dreidel is a four-sided top used in a game played
during the Jewish festival of Hanukkah. Each side has a different
Hebrew letter. A shin means give or put in a token. A hey means take
half the tokens. A gimel stands for take all the tokens. A nun means
take nothing. Before each spin of the dreidel, players put a
designated number of tokens in the middle. The first player spins the
dreidel. When the dreidel stops, the letter facing up determines what
the player puts in or takes out.</TE>

<HD>Sci-Fi's epic 'Taken' an addictive story powered by human
nature</HD>

<LD>As the miniseries "Taken" begins, pilot Russell Keys (Steve Burton)
gets shot during a World War II fight above France. Suddenly, a
mysterious blue light envelops his plane, saving him and his crew of
nine men from sure death.</LD>
<LD>   One thing is clear: We're in for a wild ride.</LD>
<LD>   The 10-part, 20-hour epic from executive producer Steven
Spielberg, shown Monday through Friday this week and next at 9 p.m.
on the Sci-Fi Channel, weaves the extraordinary stories of three
ordinary families through several generations of alien encounters and
government conspiracy. The digital effects can be dazzling, but what
makes "Taken" special is Leslie Bohem's script, which uses the
bizarre history of UFO lore as the backbone for an addictive tale of
deception, faith and loneliness in postwar America.</LD>
<TE>   Tonight's opener, directed with gusto by Tobe Hooper of
"Poltergeist" and "Texas Chainsaw Massacre," introduces the three
families -- the Keys, the Crawfords and the Clarkes -- whose
destinies will eventually collide as the secrets of decades are
revealed. Hooper is one of 10 directors used in the project.</TE>
<TE>   After the war, intense nightmares and headaches prevent Keys from
returning to normal life. Meanwhile, unscrupulous Army Capt. Owen
Crawford (Joel Gretsch) leads a search into a UFO crash in the desert
near his base in Roswell, N.M., in 1947. And in nearby Texas, lonely
mother Sally Clarke (Catherine Dent) meets a mysterious stranger
(Eric Close) who is gentle, handsome -- and not what he seems.</TE>
<TE>   Through voice-over, we also meet Allie Keys (Dakota Fanning from
"I Am Sam"), the modern-day 10-year-old girl whose journey unifies
"Taken." Fanning heads a strong cast that also includes supporting
players like Michael Moriarty as a truth-averse military officer and
Willie Garson as a spooky scientist.</TE>
<TE>   This sprawling tale requires attention and a leap of faith, but
you will soon be swept along. For a hint at where it's headed, listen
tonight as Allie makes an observation about human nature: "Nobody
wants to be alone."</TE>

<HD>Only half of cardiac victims call 911</HD>
<DH>Paramedic help raises chances of survival, but many people
drive themselves or get a ride to the ER instead.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jane E. Allen</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Americans are more aware than ever about the importance of heart
health, getting their cholesterol and blood pressure checked and
obsessing about fat in their diets. Yet, when it comes to having a
heart attack, they can be downright foolish. Just half of them call
911 for an ambulance.</LD>
<LD>   The rest (typically younger men) drive themselves to a hospital or
ask someone for a ride, potentially missing out on lifesaving
treatment by paramedics before they get to the emergency room,
according to a study published in the Nov. 25 online version of
Circulation: Journal of the American Heart Assn.</LD>
<LD>   Those arriving by ambulance not only had a greater chance of
receiving clot-busting therapy or an angioplasty to open up clogged
arteries, the study found, they also received such therapies more
quickly. They got clot-busting medications an average of 12 minutes
sooner than those who drove themselves. Those who underwent
angioplasty to open up clogged arteries received treatment an average
of 31 minutes sooner than those who came on their own -- and 56% of
them got it within the 90-minute treatment window recommended by the
American Heart Assn. and the American College of Cardiology.</LD>
<TE>   "These need to be given early to be most effective," Dr. John G.
Canto, the lead author and director of the chest pain center at the
University of Alabama at Birmingham, said in a statement.</TE>
<TE>   People who arrived at the hospital by ambulance tended to be
older, sicker, more likely to be suffering from erratic heart rhythms
and more likely to have had a history of heart problems. Their death
rate was 14.3%, compared with 5.5% of the group who weren't brought
by ambulance. But two-thirds of that difference could be explained by
their advanced age and advanced illness, putting them at higher risk
of death than those who didn't get medical attention from ambulance
crews.</TE>
<TE>   Each year, more than 1.1 million Americans suffer heart attacks
and more than 475,000 die, half within the first half-hour after the
attack. During a heart attack, a clot cuts off blood supply to part
of the heart muscle. Signs of a heart attack include pain or
discomfort -- such as tightness or a squeezing sensation -- in the
center of the chest, arms, back, neck jaw or stomach; shortness of
breath; breaking out in a cold sweat; nausea or light-headedness.</TE>
<TE>   The latest statistics are based on four years of data, involving
772,586 patients in the National Registry of Myocardial Infarction, a
study of heart attack patients treated at a quarter of the nation's
acute-care hospitals.</TE>

<HD>Think a fast can give you license to feast?</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Benedict Carey</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Many of us prepare for the feast by declaring our own famine. In
this, the season of holiday parties, family get-togethers, office
shindigs, we are, inevitably, going to eat and drink too much. So we
get ready.</LD>
<LD>   There are those who fast for a day or two now and then, or cut out
breakfast and lunch on the day of the big meal. Some declare Monday
to be yogurt day.</LD>
<LD>   Or maybe it's time for the popcorn diet while waiting for the next
day's mounds of food.</LD>
<TE>   But do these deprivation strategies, often intended to limit
calorie consumption and weight gain, actually work? Is it possible to
go from one extreme to the other and somehow strike a happy medium?</TE>
<TE>   Fat chance, nutritionists say.</TE>
<TE>   (And if you tried it last week for the first time this season,
what follows will serve more as an explanation than a cautionary
story.)</TE>
<TE>   Skipping breakfast, lunch or both on feast day may actually
increase the amount of calories we consume. In several experiments,
researchers have shown that people who skimp on lunch or breafast
tend to make up for the lost calories by eating more than usual at
the next meal.</TE>
<TE>   When we fast, psychologists say, we're doing more than just making
ourselves hungry; we may also, subconsiously, be giving ourselves
license to splurge when the big meal finally arrives.</TE>
<TE>   This kind of thinking is similar to what psychiatrists see in
people with eating disorders -- extreme denial, followed by a reward:
binging. It's quite possible to eat more calories during one huge
meal than you would in three normal ones. Susan Bowerman, of the UCLA
Center for Human Nutrition, says that people who regularly watch
their calories are especially vulnerable.</TE>
<TE>   If you're trying to stick to, say, 1,800 calories a day, you could
very quickly climb to 2,500 or more before your body senses it, she
says. It takes the stomach about 20 minutes to signal the brain that
it's full, during which time a lot of stuffing can go down the hatch.
And the penalty for the gorging is more than just extra calories.
Metabolism slows when we deprive ourselves; a sudden onslaught of
food diverts blood to the digestive system, often leaving us
lightheaded and slightly nauseated. "At that point," says Bowerman,
"you just want someone to roll you onto the couch."</TE>
<TE>   If that sounds familiar, so might this: We often drink more than
usual during the holidays, and the effects of excessive alcohol
consumption are exaggerated by fasting. Drink on an empty stomach and
the alcohol rushes through the blood-brain barrier, and you may be
swaying in the breeze a lot quicker. The sensible approach, says Amy
Hendel, an Encino nutrition consultant, is to "bank" calories, not by
fasting or any other extreme form of deprivation, but by simply
eating smaller meals on days when it's possible.</TE>

<HD>Birthing study takes a page from sports</HD>
<DH>Researchers look at ways to protect and strengthen muscles
affected in postpartum urinary incontinence.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Shari Roan</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Vaginal childbirth can so damage nerves and muscles that as many as
one-quarter of women suffer later from urinary incontinence. Some
women even opt to have caesarean sections to reduce their risk.</LD>
<LD>   But there may be a way to give birth vaginally and avoid long-term
pelvic-floor problems. That's what experts in midwifery, sports
medicine and biomechanics hope to reveal in an unusual study at the
University of Michigan. Their research will examine whether certain
exercises and labor practices can reduce the incidence of urinary
incontinence in the year following childbirth. Some of the approaches
are based on knowledge from sports medicine about how muscles work
and are damaged.</LD>
<LD>   "We're trying to understand what it is about the way we do birth
that might put women at risk for urinary incontinence," says Carolyn
M. Sampselle, a University of Michigan professor of nursing and
women's health who is leading the investigation. "We think there are
some things we could be doing better."</LD>
<TE>   For example, she says, contractions are often monitored by
machines during labor. Doctors, nurses and midwives usually watch the
monitor in the final stage of labor and tell women when to push to
expel the baby. But preliminary research suggests that women push
differently when told to do so than they do when pushing
spontaneously, or when they feel like it. Women who are told to push
often make a long, sustained, intense effort, while women in more
natural settings will push in shorter bursts with more rests in
between.</TE>
<TE>   This could be important in terms of the amount of damage that is
sustained to the muscles and nerves in the pelvic region, says
Sampselle. Sports medicine studies have shown that slower, shorter
stretches better protect muscles than sudden, intense stretching.</TE>
<TE>   "I truly believe that what we've done with birth in the United
States is take it out of the hands of women," she says. "We don't
understand and honor women's bodies and the strengths they bring to
childbirth. I suspect that women's bodies do intuitively know how to
most effectively push."</TE>
<TE>   As part of the study, which has just begun, obstetrical teams at
two Ann Arbor hospitals will be asked to refrain from telling women
how and when to push. In another part of the study, women will
massage their perineum, the opening of the birth canal, with a
lubricant beginning six weeks before pregnancy. A few minutes per day
of gently stretching the vaginal opening could better prepare the
tissues for childbirth, Sampselle says. This, too, is based on sports
medicine and bioengineering principles that slow stretching over time
strengthens muscles.</TE>
<TE>   Sampselle is also studying the effectiveness of pelvic or Kegel
exercises to prevent incontinence. Kegels have been shown to help
older women with the problem, but there is little research on whether
regular pelvic-floor exercises before and after childbirth can reduce
the risk of tissue damage. All of the 400 women in the study will be
instructed to do Kegel exercises, while others will be randomized
into groups that receive massage instruction or are told to push only
when they feel like it during labor. Sampselle says she hopes the
study gives women and health-care professionals a strategy for
pursuing vaginal childbirth without the fear of later pelvic floor
damage.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm hoping our research will point the way to say, 'We need to
let women listen to their bodies,' " she says.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   About incontinence</TE>
<TE>   People with urinary incontinence have at least two of three main
symptoms: frequency, urgency and incontinence. Frequency is described
as the need to urinate more than eight times a day and more than
twice at night.</TE>
<TE>   Approximately 17 million Americans have urinary incontinence.</TE>
<TE>   An estimated 34% of older women and 25% of middle-age or younger
women have the disorder.</TE>
<TE>   Women with one or more vaginal births are 2.5 times more likely to
develop urinary incontinence.</TE>
<TE>   Costs to treat urinary incontinence are estimated at $16 billion a
year in the United States.</TE>
<TE>   Urinary incontinence usually can be successfully treated with
behavioral therapy, such as exercise; medications; or surgery.</TE>

<HD>New pyramid is built on disease prevention</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Dianne Partie Lange</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The food guide pyramid needs to be rebuilt if Americans are to
significantly cut their risk of chronic diseases, Harvard researchers
say.</LD>
<LD>   They designed and tested a new pyramid, one that emphasizes fiber
from whole grains rather than refined ones, white meat (fish or
chicken) over red and unsaturated fats over saturated ones. It also
suggests alternate protein sources, such as nuts and soy, a
multivitamin and moderate alcohol intake. The U.S. Department of
Agriculture pyramid and the Harvard one emphasize fruits and
vegetables.</LD>
<LD>   The researchers analyzed responses of 100,000 men and women to
food questionnaires completed periodically over 10 years. Because the
volunteers were participating in long-term health studies, data about
their illnesses were also available.</LD>
<TE>   Using the Alternative Healthy Eating Index, a scoring system that
measured how closely volunteers' diets matched the new guidelines,
the researchers found that men with the highest scores lowered their
risk of chronic diseases by 20%, compared with participants with the
lowest scores and that women cut their risk by 11%. Previously, the
researchers had found that adhering to the USDA guidelines reduced
the risk by 11% for men and 3% for women. The biggest effect of the
new guidelines was on heart disease, the researchers said. "The
reduction in risk was twice as strong as when we evaluated the USDA
guidelines," says coauthor Marji McCullough, a researcher at the
American Cancer Society in Atlanta.</TE>
<TE>   The study was published in the December issue of the American
Journal of Clinical Nutrition.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Women's risk of 'sudden death' from heart disease seems to be
rising</TE>
<TE>   More than 60% of people who die from heart disease die within an
hour of experiencing symptoms. Although past studies indicated that
women were at much lower risk of "sudden death" than men, it appears
they're catching up.</TE>
<TE>   Nearly 6,000 people treated in 27 Danish coronary care units for
heart attacks were followed for an average of 32 months. During that
time, 1,261 died of heart disease, 536 of whom were victims of sudden
death. Researchers at Denmark's National Institute of Public Health
in Copenhagen found that, after accounting for age differences, men's
risk of sudden death was only 1.3 times higher than women's risk.</TE>
<TE>   "I think women are getting closer to the male risk ...
because their lifestyle is becoming more like men's ... women work as much
and, in Denmark, smoke as much as men," says Dr. Steen Abildstrom,
the lead author of the study. The findings were published in the
November issue of the journal Heart.</TE>
<TE>   In the United States, sudden death has decreased in both sexes,
writes Dr. William J. Groh and his colleagues at the Indiana
University School of Medicine in an editorial accompanying the study.
However, because the decrease in women is significantly less than
men, the women are catching up, Groh says.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Mammograms may be valuable well past age 70</TE>
<TE>   Most medical organizations agree that screening mammography should
begin at age 40. Now researchers suggest that healthy women well into
their 70s would be wise to have annual mammograms. Breast cancer
increases with age and is highest in women 75 to 79 years old.</TE>
<TE>   In an analysis of data from more than 12,000 women older than 69
with breast cancer, researchers confirmed that women 75 and older
were more likely to be diagnosed with advanced disease than those
between 69 and 74 years of age. The older women also were
significantly less likely to have had annual mammograms.</TE>
<TE>   The good news is that those older women who had two or more annual
screenings before diagnosis had smaller tumors, the same as younger
women. Among women who did not get mammograms, 38% of the younger
group and 49% of the older women had tumors greater than 2
centimeters, says Dr. James S. Goodwin, a study coauthor and director
of the Sealy Center on Aging at the University of Texas Medical
Branch in Galveston. The study was published in the Nov. 19 issue of
Annals of Internal Medicine.</TE>

<LD>Patients often have medical questions that could be resolved with a
simple e-mail to their doctor, but physicians have had little
incentive to respond outside scheduled appointments. Now they do.</LD>
<LD>   Beginning next year, Blue Shield of California members may choose
to consult with their doctors online about such non-urgent concerns
as medication side effects, menopausal symptoms and back pain.</LD>
<LD>   Blue Shield, the state's third-largest health plan (behind Kaiser
Permanente and Blue Cross), will be the nation's first major health
insurer to make the online consultations financially feasible. It
will reimburse doctors $20 for the Web visits.</LD>
<TE>   The insurer decided to go forward with online consultations based
on the successes of a pilot study involving about 250 of its doctors
and 2,000 subscribers.</TE>
<TE>   "The idea is to improve patient access," said Dr. Jeffrey Rideout,
president of Blue Shield of California Foundation, who said it
remains to be seen how many Blue Shield doctors will want to
participate. "When we got results back showing us this saves money,
we were delighted."</TE>
<TE>   A recent analysis, conducted by Stanford University and UC
Berkeley researchers, found that the insurer could save more than
$1.50 per member per month by giving patients and doctors the option
to use the Internet for some medical matters. If 10% of the plan's
current 2.3 million members use the system, Blue Shield would save $4
million a year in office visits, Rideout said. Doctors who tried the
pilot program said that reducing the number of patients coming into
the office with minor problems gave them more time with patients
needing more complex care.</TE>
<TE>   Patients said the online consultations let them get timely answers
to questions, saving them a drive to the doctor's office and
inevitable waiting. "If you don't feel like going out for a doctor's
appointment, all you have to do is go in and describe specifically
what is wrong," said Gloria L. Smith, 51, of Sacramento, who said she
also has used the system to make sure she's taking new medications
properly.</TE>
<TE>   Blue Shield is using technology from RelayHealth of Emeryville,
Calif., designed to allow confidential communication between patient
and doctor. Blue Shield subscribers sign on to the system through the
insurer's Web site.</TE>
<TE>   A series of questions establishes whether they need administrative
help -- with setting up an appointment or getting a prescription
refill, which can be done through the system -- or whether they need
the doctor's help. The system asks about medical history, medications
and the nature and magnitude of their problem, then delivers a
detailed message to the doctor.</TE>
<TE>   About a quarter of patient messages result in a return message
from the doctor, called an online clinical visit, for which the
doctor charges, said Eric Zimmerman, RelayHealth Corp. vice president
for product marketing.</TE>
<TE>   Patients in a Blue Shield HMO have a $10 co-payment for the online
consultation, while those in a PPO plan typically have to pay for
some portion of the visit, said Rideout.</TE>
<TE>   "We're not trying to have physicians do over the Internet what
they wouldn't feel comfortable doing over the phone," said Rideout,
the health plan's former chief medical officer. "It's not meant to be
used for anything that's clinically complex. It's always meant to be
used for established patients."</TE>
<TE>   Doctors are encouraged to respond to patients within a day. If
that much time has passed and they haven't responded, the system
sends them an electronic reminder; it generates a telephone call to
the doctor if he or she hasn't responded within 48 hours, he said.
And, if they habitually don't answer patient queries, Rideout said
they can be dropped from the online program.</TE>
<TE>   Among pilot participants has been Dr. Winni Loesch, a
family-practice doctor in Sacramento, who said the system lets her
get information directly from the patient.</TE>
<TE>   "Normally, patients call and they have to leave a message on
voicemail, and it has to be transcribed [by staff] and you have to
read their handwriting and hope they took down everything the patient
said," Loesch said.</TE>
<TE>   The online exchanges are particularly useful for patients with
minor complaints or those who need to let the doctor know how they're
faring on a new medication or how they're recuperating. While the
online consultations are similar to telephone conversations, for
which she is not reimbursed, Loesch finds them more efficient and
focused than telephone calls. While on the phone, a patient will
often say, "Now, while I have you on the line" and then enumerate
other issues the doctor may not have time to address.</TE>
<TE>   Some of her patients like the online access too.</TE>
<TE>   "It's really more effective [than a short office visit] because I
have more time to think about what I'm writing to her and describing
it better to her," said Smith, who works for the state Department of
Justice in Sacramento.</TE>
<TE>   Plus, if Smith is in a hurry and forgets to ask something during a
scheduled appointment, she knows she can always type it into the
computer and get a response within 24 hours.</TE>
<TE>   Smith said online communications with Loesch have helped her
manage mood swings and menopausal symptoms following a hysterectomy
and control her cholesterol. Of course, Loesch is the ideal
participant: She's comfortable on the computer and finds it easy to
check for messages several times a day. Her two partners, she said,
aren't similarly inclined.</TE>
<TE>   Rideout said that one obstacle in getting more doctors onto the
system is dispelling the perception that online medicine will add to
their workload. Given that, he said: "if we got even 10% of our
physicians signed on, we'd be thrilled."</TE>

<HD>Thriving despite it all</HD>
<DH>Why some children are resilient -- able to overcome severe
trauma -- may hold the answers to emotional healing.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Melissa Healy</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When he was 6 years old, Rasheen Coleman's drug-addicted mother
chased him around a room wielding a knife and threatening to cut off
his fingers. For years, his mother regularly berated Rasheen and beat
him with anything that was at hand: her purse, a broomstick, her
fists. The little boy was regularly in charge of two young
half-siblings, preparing their meals and supervising their play. Any
lapse -- a middling report card or a brother's naughty behavior --
would bring a storm of his mother's verbal and physical wrath upon
Rasheen.</LD>
<LD>   And then, when Rasheen was 12, his ordeal was over. His mother
died of AIDS.</LD>
<LD>   By reliable estimates, more than half of kids like Rasheen would
enter adulthood with festering psychological wounds of one sort or
another. A victim of such severe abuse is more likely than the
broader population to have fallen prey to mental illness or
addiction, to have dropped out of school, relied on public aid or run
afoul of the law. He or she would be far more likely to have had a
string of failed relationships or jobs. Almost half, according to one
study, would go on to abuse or neglect their own children.</LD>
<TE>   But somewhere at the core of Rasheen Coleman, there is a certain
steel. And perhaps too, at the core of kids like him lies a more
subtle alchemy: the secret to mending, and maybe even preventing, the
emotional wreckage that child abuse and neglect can leave in its
wake. It is a prospect that mental-health professionals increasingly
hope to mine.</TE>
<TE>   Now a 25-year-old graduate student at Texas A&amp;M, Coleman proclaims
"an abundance of hope." He lives a life surrounded by friends,
directed by ambitions and disciplined by the experience of having
faced crushing adversity and beaten the odds, all at a tender age.</TE>
<TE>   Coleman struggles -- mightily and daily. But most days, optimism
and discipline just seem to trump the fear, anger and self-doubt of
his childhood. He is shy, but pushes himself toward a career in
politics. He likes to party and have fun, but won't allow himself so
much as a cigar for fear of addiction. He wants to forgive the woman
who turned his childhood into a nightmare, but also wants to forget
her and move on.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm more than a conqueror," says Coleman in a voice that conveys
more conviction than boast. "Whatever I face, I know I'll be able to
overcome it. I don't let things get me down."</TE>
<TE>   For those who study the long-term effects of child abuse and
neglect, survivors like Coleman are models of resilience, and,
increasingly, objects of intense scrutiny. Early in his adulthood,
Coleman appears to have escaped the most typical effects of a
childhood marked by severe abuse, including depression, criminality,
academic failure and substance abuse.</TE>
<TE>   According to the Department of Health and Human Services, 984,000
children were victims of maltreatment in 1998, the latest year for
which figures were available. More than half suffered neglect, while
almost 1 in 4 were physically abused. Nearly 12% were sexually
abused.</TE>
<TE>   The mistreatment of children is as old as parenthood itself, and
the study of child abuse and neglect is a venerable academic field.
But a recent event -- the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001 -- has
brought new focus and research funds to the community. After
thousands of children were exposed directly to the horror of those
attacks -- and millions more through public media -- government
officials scrambled for insights into the causes, effects and
treatment of childhood trauma. Those who study and treat victims of
child abuse were among the first to step forward with treatment
programs and ideas for further study.</TE>
<TE>   It was not their first foray into subjects making news. During the
1980s and '90s, many in the child-abuse field turned to the study of
children traumatized by gang- and drug-related violence in their
communities. Studying ever-broader populations of children, says Joy
Osofsky, a leading thinker in the field, has helped the field mature
quickly. And the new focus on "protective factors" -- or resilience
-- is a result of that, she adds.</TE>
<TE>   "With more understanding about how trauma impacts children, we've
learned more about children who experience trauma differently," says
Osofsky, vice president of the organization Zero to Three, and a
psychologist at Louisiana State University. "And we've seen that
somehow, with various resources and circumstances, some children are
able to weather it and move on." While the research lags behind that
observation, the intriguing treatment implications of "protective
factors" are sparking more interest than ever, she adds.</TE>
<TE>   Throughout the mental-health profession, the new emphasis on
resilience serves two purposes. First, it is a hopeful reminder from
social scientists that the abused child does not always face an
immutable sentence of doom: They are asserting that factors such as
child abuse -- or low birth weight or a family history of mental
illness -- stack the probabilistic deck against a kid. While they may
warn of "increased risk," they are not predicting his guaranteed
failure. Some kids, they acknowledge, emerge perfectly fine.</TE>
<TE>   Second, social scientists hope that if they can distill the
qualities of resilience in some children, they can use these lessons
in the treatment of all abused or neglected children.</TE>
<TE>   But if the idea is simple, it is a vastly more complex challenge
to tease out and treat the effects of violence and indifference on a
child. The virulence and duration of a child's exposure to abuse
matter -- and vary widely from one case to another. And so,
apparently, does the nature of the mistreatment. Neglect, while
frequently lumped with abuse, may leave fewer physical scars but
deeper psychological hurt than some hitting. It was long believed
that a youngster would not be harmed by witnessing the abuse of
another in his home. Now, researchers suspect that the resulting fear
is psychologically as corrosive as direct abuse of the child. And
while sexual abuse may still be the most shocking form of
mistreatment, many clinicians are beginning to believe that emotional
abuse -- constant criticism and berating -- wreaks the greatest
damage in the long term.</TE>
<TE>   Beyond that, the temperament a child starts life with matters
greatly -- whether she is irritable or easygoing will affect not only
how well she copes with adversity, but how a parent will respond to
her and whether the two will form an early bond. And along the path
of her childhood, the serendipitous appearance of an adult "buffer"
-- a stepparent, teacher or coach -- can spell a world of difference
in the life of an abused or neglected child.</TE>
<TE>   "There is no magic pill," says L. Alan Sroufe, a psychologist at
the University of Minnesota's Institute of Child Development.
Resilience, Sroufe notes, "is not just something you have or don't
have; it's a developmental construction."</TE>
<TE>   In other words, resilience does not simply happen to some kids and
not to others. It evolves in some kids, given the right
circumstances, and it can atrophy in those who get no emotional
support from inside or outside their family, says Sroufe. "There are
no good seeds or bad seeds. There's virtually no child who, with
enough help, doesn't do OK, and no child who, if enough is going
against them, doesn't struggle."</TE>
<TE>   Steven Wolin, a Washington D.C., psychiatrist, calls resilience a
potential which is present in every child. "It's like having biceps
-- muscles with potential. How they develop depends on how much and
how you use them."</TE>
<TE>   Removed from home</TE>
<TE>   Although his youth was punctuated by terrible pain and loss, some
circumstances did smile on Rasheen Coleman, and the little boy's
sweet nature seemed to help draw sympathetic adults to him.</TE>
<TE>   When he was 10, the state of Texas removed Coleman and his
half-siblings from his mother's home and, after bouncing briefly from
orphanage to foster family, they landed in Omaha, Neb., with his
aunt, a hard-working mother of three. There, he became involved in
the South Omaha Boys Club (now the Boys &amp; Girls Club), and met a
series of staff counselors whose attention, he says, made him feel
special and built his self-confidence. If he did not show up at the
club when he was expected, a counselor named Ruth Hamlin would
venture into the public housing complex he lived in with his aunt and
collect him -- a gesture of commitment to him at which Coleman still
marvels more than a decade later.</TE>
<TE>   Although he was not athletic ("I realized later that fast-moving
things around me made me feel nervous," he recounts now), counselors
drew him into community service projects, which had a profound effect
on him. "I felt like, 'I can do this,' " says Coleman. "This shy,
withdrawn person who really didn't feel like I wanted to live: I had
this sense of usefulness, a sense of worth, a sense that I belonged."</TE>
<TE>   He attended Creighton Preparatory High School, a Catholic school
where, he remembers, a teacher named Tom Hoover once told him,
"Rasheen, you're a leader -- a quiet leader, but sometimes, that's
just what's needed."</TE>
<TE>   Coleman went on to be named the Boys &amp; Girls Club of America's
Youth of the Year in 1997 -- an honor that involved speaking often
and publicly about his painful past. The recognition also landed him
in the Oval Office for a brief chat with President Bill Clinton. In
2001, Coleman graduated from Morehouse College in Atlanta, one of the
nation's leading traditionally black colleges.</TE>
<TE>   But lucky breaks late in adolescence clearly are not enough. If
there is one point on which most researchers agree, it is that the
cornerstone of a child's resilience is his first loving bond to an
adult.</TE>
<TE>   "The best resilience predictor for a child is a caring
relationship with one adult, hopefully a parent," says Patricia Van
Horn of UC San Francisco's Child Trauma Research Project. "The more
relations like that, the better. But children who have at least one
do better than those who don't."</TE>
<TE>   The UCSF project, housed at San Francisco General Hospital,
traditionally has treated children who have watched as their primary
caregiver, usually the mother, were abused by a partner. In many
cases, the child herself also was abused or neglected, compounding
the trauma. In an effort to fortify the traumatized child, Van Horn
and her colleagues first must try to repair a relationship between
that child and her mother (or whoever cares for her), which has been
roiled by the domestic violence. The battered parent and child often
see each other as reminders of the traumatic event, which disrupts
communication, trust and affection. If the child is to lay down the
first building blocks of healthy relationships later, the tears in
the fabric of this first relationship must be mended.</TE>
<TE>   In the literature of child development, the first attachment a
baby makes -- most often, though not necessarily, with her mother --
forms the basis and shapes the terms of most all future
relationships. If this first give-and-take is a good partnership, a
child learns about how to get his needs fulfilled and how to control
his impulses. He will build the capacity to see adults as reliable
and trustworthy, and so, even if the first relationship disappears or
disintegrates, he should be able to reach out positively for comfort
and support if another adult steps forward.</TE>
<TE>   The pivotal importance of that first bond is underscored by the
work of Sroufe and his research partner Byron Egeland, both at the
University of Minnesota's Institute of Development. Twenty-six years
ago, the two started tracking 267 children, all from families with
low income and education, at birth. From family members, teachers and
the children, the research team took periodic psychological
soundings, including a battery of visits and observations in the
first three years.</TE>
<TE>   Sroufe and Egeland concluded that 15% of their research subjects
had been abused or neglected. Among those infants growing up with a
"psychologically unavailable" caregiver (children who also were, in
some cases, abused or neglected), not one was deemed to have
developed a "secure attachment" to that caregiver at the ages of 12
months and 18 months. By the age of 17, only four of the mistreated
kids Egeland and Sroufe were following were judged to be completely
free of symptoms that amounted to mental illness. In all four cases,
a firm bond with a parent had been recorded at an early age.</TE>
<TE>   Egeland surmises that this early experience of trust probably
makes a difference at a critical juncture: When a caring adult
reaches out to support a mistreated child later in his school-age
years, the child who had some early experience of an adult as
reliable and trustworthy was able, socially and psychologically, to
grab the lifeline. Children without that foundation may have rebuffed
or failed to recognize such overtures, and never found what Coleman
said he found in the staff of the Boys &amp; Girls Club: "a second home
and a second family."</TE>
<TE>   A respite with 'Big Ma'</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, in Coleman's case, the early signs were promising, as
well.</TE>
<TE>   When Coleman was 6 months old, his drug-addicted mother willingly
handed him over to the stern, God-fearing matriarch of her family,
whom he came to know and love as "Big Ma." For the next five years,
Rasheen has happy memories of a childhood in Bertha Moore's
prodigious shadow. Growing up in Mobile, Ala., he remembers singing
in the church choir, sitting with the adults right behind his
great-grandmother. He remembers being the one to carry her cookies to
all the church functions. She was strict, he says, but fair and
loving. "The person I am today was because of her."</TE>
<TE>   When Rasheen was 6, he heard a banging at the door and a hollering
he knew was his mother's voice. She snatched the boy up from in front
of his cartoon and drove with him and a half-sister and brother he
had never met from Alabama to Dallas. A stepfather passed briefly
through his life, bringing a measure of protection and companionship.
But he abandoned Rasheen, under a rain of his mother's blows as well.</TE>
<TE>   This four-year ordeal of neglect, abuse and loss has not been
without consequences for Coleman. He acknowledges that he is
extremely reserved about his emotions and has found it hard to
sustain a close romantic relationship with a woman -- problems that
UCSF's Van Horn says are a classic fallout from abuse involving a
parent.</TE>
<TE>   "Just relating to women, I find it very difficult. Not having that
love and affection from my mom or my dad has been difficult," says
Coleman now, who says he draws his greatest strength from his
Pentecostal Christian faith. "I just have to grow and mature. I won't
use it as an excuse.... I have to decide I want to be a great
husband, a great father."</TE>
<TE>   Now finishing his master's at the George Bush School of Government
and Public Service, Coleman hopes to marry a woman who is his
mother's opposite -- and his own complement. Not explosive. But also
not too shy, like he is himself.</TE>
<TE>   And would he ever hit or berate the wife and two children (first a
boy, then a girl) that are the family of his dreams?</TE>
<TE>   Here, Coleman relies on the happy confluence of the many factors
that have made his life so far a triumph against bad odds. He has
faced the pain and loss, often and openly. And Coleman acquired a
gift for empathy.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think I would ever do to my kids, or to my wife, what my
mother did to me," says Coleman quietly. "I just know how it felt --
and I would never want anyone to feel like that, especially my kids."</TE>

<HD>The intriguing promise of coenzyme Q10</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Shari Roan</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Coenzyme Q10, a nutrient made by the liver (and found in some foods),
was discovered about 40 years ago. Scientists have become
increasingly interested in the substance because of its role as an
antioxidant and in helping cells produce energy. Last month,
researchers at UC San Diego reported that coenzyme Q10 supplements
might slow the progression of Parkinson's disease.</LD>
<LD>   Uses: Because it is crucial to cell energy function, coenzyme Q10
supplements may have broad uses, especially in people whose natural
coenzyme Q10 levels are low. This includes individuals with
congestive heart failure and other cardiac disorders, inflammatory
gum disease and AIDS. The nutrient also has been used by people with
cancer to reduce the toxicity of some types of chemotherapy.</LD>
<LD>   Dose: Typically 100 to 300 milligrams a day. Some experts
recommend taking the supplement with meals.</LD>
<TE>   Precautions: Coenzyme Q10 appears to be safe, even in doses of
1,200 milligrams a day. It can interact with medications used to
treat heart failure, diabetes, kidney or liver problems. Some people
have diarrhea, stomach upset and poor appetite from taking the
supplements.</TE>
<TE>   Research: There is a great deal of research underway on coenzyme
Q10. So far, the best evidence for its use is for congestive heart
failure. For other conditions, such as for Parkinson's disease and
for cancer, it is too early to say whether coenzyme Q10 will help.
Only a few studies have been done on how the nutrient might affect
people with high blood pressure, high cholesterol or angina. Early
studies on its ability to improve athletic performance have been
unimpressive.</TE>
<TE>   Dietary supplement makers are not required by the U.S. government
to demonstrate that their products are safe or effective. Ask your
health-care provider for advice on selecting a brand.</TE>

<HD>Clinical trials are suffering</HD>
<DH>Suspicious of medical research, volunteers spurn tests of
possibly lifesaving advances.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<LD>Clinical trials are essential to medical progress -- they're the only
way of testing whether new drugs, surgical techniques or experimental
devices actually work. But researchers are finding it increasingly
difficult to find volunteers. A new study illuminates part of the
problem. Americans are deeply suspicious of medical research, it
found, and don't trust their doctors to protect them from unnecessary
risks when prescribing treatment.</LD>
<LD>   "This is really an indictment of medical research," said Dr.
Giselle Corbie-Smith, co-author of the study published last week in
the Archives of Internal Medicine. "If individuals distrust the
research enterprise and are unwilling to participate in it, it could
impede patient recruitment for clinical trials."</LD>
<LD>   Such distrust could also keep advanced, if unproved, treatments
from the very patients who need them most.</LD>
<TE>   Although researchers have always had problems recruiting patients,
they say the problem has worsened. In 2001, 86% of all clinical
trials didn't meet enrollment goals, causing delays of up to a year,
up from 80% in 1999.</TE>
<TE>   "People thinking they are guinea pigs is just one element of a
larger picture," said Diana L. Anderson, president of a patient
recruitment company in Dallas, Texas.</TE>
<TE>   The sheer magnitude of the number of trials is one component. Last
year, more than 6,000 new therapies, including drugs, procedures and
devices, were tested in 80,000 locations around the country,
according to CenterWatch, a Boston-based patient information group
that monitors the clinical trial industry.</TE>
<TE>   Another reason for the recruitment problems is that some
treatments being tested are for relatively rare disorders, so there's
a limited pool of patients to draw upon. And last, eligibility
requirements for some clinical trials are so strict that few people
qualify. For tests of some experimental cancer therapies, for
example, volunteers must be terminal and have failed standard
therapy. Yet they can't be too sick -- otherwise they won't respond
to the treatment.</TE>
<TE>   Still, distrust plays a significant role, according to last week's
study. Although it has been known that large numbers of African
Americans are suspicious of medical research, researchers were
surprised to find skepticism among whites too.</TE>
<TE>   Almost four out of five African Americans and more than half of
whites believe that people could be used as "guinea pigs" for
research without their consent. Many respondents -- 63% of African
Americans and 38% of whites -- believed their doctors often prescribe
medication as a way of experimenting on people without their
knowledge or consent, and almost half of African Americans and more
than a third of whites felt their doctors sometimes exposed them to
unnecessary risks when deciding their treatments.</TE>
<TE>   "We expected to see differences, but we didn't expect to see such
high levels of distrust across the board," said Corbie-Smith, an
assistant professor of medicine at the University of North Carolina,
Chapel Hill.</TE>
<TE>   These negative attitudes could ultimately derail medical advances.
New drugs and medical devices must prove that they are safe and
effective before they can be approved for use in the United States.
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration requires that these treatments
be thoroughly tested in extensive clinical trials, which often
encompass thousands of people.</TE>
<TE>   Consequently, without patient participation in these studies,
"there would be no new products coming out," said Ken Getz, chief
executive of CenterWatch.</TE>
<TE>   Experts say this lack of public trust is a legacy of medical
research's checkered history. In the 1950s and '60s, for instance,
prison inmates and terminally ill patients were injected with live
cancer cells, and U.S. Army soldiers were given LSD without their
knowledge.</TE>
<TE>   The most infamous of these incidents was the syphilis experiment
started in the 1930s at Alabama's Tuskegee Institute, accounting for
much of African Americans' lingering distrust of medical research.
For more than 40 years, treatment was withheld from 400
syphilis-infected African Americans, who were never told what they
had, so doctors could watch the natural progression of the disease.</TE>
<TE>   In recent years, Americans' confidence has been further undermined
by the highly publicized deaths of two relatively healthy volunteers
in studies at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore and the
University of Pennsylvania. In a 2001 survey conducted by the Assn.
of Clinical Research Professionals in Washington, D.C., about 40% of
their members said it had become more difficult to enroll patients
because of the media attention over these and other problems with
clinical trials.</TE>
<TE>   "Research institutions have abused the great reservoir they have
of goodwill among the American people," said Adil Shamoo, a
bioethicist at the University of Maryland School of Medicine in
Baltimore and co-founder of the advocacy organization Citizens for
Responsible Care and Research.</TE>
<TE>   Yet federal data indicate it's rare for people to die of
negligence or poor care in clinical trials, and only 1 in 10,000
patients has died of the effects of drugs being studied. The lesson
here, said Mark Eisenach, chief executive of Acurian, a clinical
trials company in Philadelphia, "is that we're not doing enough to
explain how medical research works, and the benefits and rewards of
that participation."</TE>
<TE>   Volunteers in clinical trials normally receive state-of-the-art
care from physicians considered leaders in their field. For people
suffering from terminal illness, these tests may be their last
chance, and the experimental therapy may spare or lengthen their
lives. Given these misgivings, however, people thinking about
volunteering for a clinical trial "need to educate themselves so they
feel comfortable about the process," said Getz.</TE>

Health Plans (www.aahp.org).</TE>

<HD>Return to 4-wheel drive in a pair of roller skates</HD>
<DH>Even if it's been years since you've strapped them on,
you're sure to find something suitable among the new designs.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>J. Michael Kennedy</AU>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Over the last year, I've done a lot of things involving wheels --
bicycles, in-line skates and even a pair of Crosskates, which are
designed for a skiing experience when there is no snow. This time
around, I decided to go retro, to return to a sport of my youth, to
go roller-skating.</LD>
<LD>   I'm talking about the kind with four wheels that I used to wear as
I zipped down neighborhood sidewalks and around roller rinks to rock
'n' roll music played by disc jockeys. I date back to the skate-key
era. By my reckoning, it had been around 40 years since I'd laced up
a pair of roller-skates.</LD>
<LD>   But within the last year, they've become much more common, what
with the minor craze over the Skechers skates -- a common sight these
days on oceanfront boardwalks.</LD>
<TE>   "Roller-skates seem to be making a comeback," said Javier Cernas,
the owner of J's Rentals on the Venice Beach boardwalk. "I have
people coming in all the time asking where they can buy them."</TE>
<TE>   Not only that, but a skate park around the corner draws an
increasing number of roller-skaters on the weekend to dance to DJ
music and strut their new tricks.</TE>
<TE>   The first roller-skate was invented by a Belgian named Joseph
Merlin in 1760. One of the first things he did was wear them to a
party and crash into an expensive mirror. The roller-skate came to
the United States in 1863, and within 20 years the sport had become a
popular pastime, particularly among the wealthy. Then came rinks and
plastic wheels and other improvements that increased its popularity.
And then, finally, the in-line skate arrived on the scene, starting a
15-year craze that overshadowed the roller-skate.</TE>
<TE>   But that may be changing. Dale Johnson of the Indianapolis-based
Roller Skating Assn. International said that in rinks, at least, the
standard four-wheeled skates -- known as quads -- are now preferred 2
to 1 over the in-lines, largely because they're conducive to fancier
footwork.</TE>
<TE>   Cernas, who's been renting beach items for the last 4 1/2 years,
said he recommends in-line over roller-skates for beginners simply
because their hard plastic shell gives more ankle support. The
high-topped roller skates offer better support than the tennis shoe
variety for the same reason, he said.</TE>
<TE>   I started with the standard high-topped roller skate, lacing up
and heading out the door. Compared to in-line skates, the
roller-skates felt more solid underfoot, which might make them a
better choice for beginners. But I also remember roller rink days
when neophytes would hold the rail, for fear of the skates flying out
from under them.</TE>
<TE>   As I left the rental shop I saw a man standing in the square
holding what looked like two cobras.</TE>
<TE>   "Geez," I asked Cernas. "Are those real?"</TE>
<TE>   "No," he replied with a chuckle. "Rubber."</TE>
<TE>   I started hesitantly, because the feel of roller-skates is
definitely unlike that of in-line skates. It's more difficult to push
off, and balance at first was difficult. But after a few minutes I
was rolling along, heading for Santa Monica. A tall, comely woman
zipped past me on roller-skates, which made me feel that at least I
was in good company. She was not the only person who passed me,
though. It seemed like dozens of in-line skaters rolled by, easily
outdistancing me.</TE>
<TE>   After about 20 minutes of skating, I turned around and headed back
to Venice, past the fortunetellers and what passed for art along the
boardwalk. I turned in my rented skates and pulled out my new
Skechers skates. I'd tried to find them for rent, but with no
success. So I bought a pair for $92 and change. It was only after
doing so that I learned from Skechers spokeswoman Jennifer Clay that
sneakers on wheels were invented in Venice Beach in the 1970s. The
new commercial version has been around for about a year, and more
companies are offering the skates. Clay didn't want to get into
specific figures about their popularity, but did say the company is
"extremely pleased" with sales.</TE>
<TE>   I laced up and headed out again. The glide of the skate was much
smoother than that of the standard variety lace-up, a fact I
attributed to the Skechers' newness. At first, there was little
strain on the ankle, but I did begin to feel a twinge after about
half an hour. And though I did go faster with the new skates, the
in-liners were still passing me by the dozen. Their design just gives
them more zip.</TE>
<TE>   But there was plenty of exercise with both sets of skates -- more,
in fact, than I'd gotten with the in-line version months before. At
one point my heart rate climbed to 167 and was out of the recommended
zone for much of the outing. I rolled back to J's rentals and
collected my things. The guy with the rubber cobras was still in the
square.</TE>
<TE>   One footnote about the Skechers' skates: When I went to the Santa
Monica store to buy them, I noticed that a new line is on sale. They
are the familiar, traditional kind, like the ones I wore zipping
around the rink, rock 'n' roll blaring, more than 40 years ago.</TE>
<TE>   Retro is back.</TE>

<HD>Be aware of the message in giving fitness equipment</HD>
<DH>Such a gift 'comes with strings attached,' says a
psychologist. And it can quickly sour the holiday mood.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jeannine Stein</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Fitness equipment may seem like an ideal holiday gift, given with the
best intentions. But when the recipient has expressed little interest
in getting in shape -- or is sensitive about a weight problem -- such
a gift could quickly put a halt to the festive mood.</LD>
<LD>   Weight and body image are often extremely touchy subjects. While
gifts such as vacuum cleaners and personal grooming kits can be
annoying in their underlying messages, they don't have the same
emotional sting as a gift that says, "You need to shape up, tubby."</LD>
<LD>   "A gift like this comes with strings attached," says Sarah K.
Perry, a Los Angeles psychologist. "It's like saying, 'If I'm getting
you this, you'd better use it, and I won't like you if you don't use
it.' You're just carrying on the argument."</LD>
<TE>   Perry, the author of "Loving in Flow: The Optimal Experience for
Couples" (Casablanca Press, 2003), suggests avoiding such gifts
unless the subject of toning up or losing weight has already been
broached with the person.</TE>
<TE>   With obesity a growing problem in the United States, cues to lose
weight are everywhere, from television commercials to magazine ads.
But, says Philadelphia-based clinical psychologist Michael Broder, a
blatant reminder in the form of a gift won't necessarily jump-start
motivation.</TE>
<TE>   "When I needed to lose weight, nobody could have coerced me into
doing it," says Broder, author of "Can Your Relationship Be Saved?:
How to Know Whether to Stay or Go" (Impact Publishers, 2002). "If you
have someone who is not asking for help, and you're forcing the
issue, then they're going to think, 'OK, that's my notice, if I don't
take some weight off, they're going to run off with somebody else.'
I've seen people get divorced over weight."</TE>
<TE>   An alternative, says Perry, is to make getting fit a family
project: "You could say something like, 'Here's something we can both
use and share.' Just as you can enable bad health habits, you can
enable good ones too. But don't control the situation."</TE>
<TE>   Broder suggests talking about the underlying causes of weight gain
or lack of fitness: "Maybe the person feels he can't lose weight, or
they've tried to do it and failed. When it's all out there on the
table, that's healthy."</TE>
<TE>   And some say the holiday period may not be the best time to
consider a fitness-related gift. For many, the holidays are an
emotional roller coaster. It's also a time when people are encouraged
to indulge and make New Year's resolutions. Adding a gift that's a
catalyst for a weight-related argument could prove disastrous.</TE>
<TE>   "The holidays have unfortunately become so much about
expectations," says Broder, "that even when you have the best
intentions, sometimes a gesture is received any way but the way you
meant it. Anything a couple can do to circumvent that is good."</TE>
<TE>   If the recipient has expressed some interest in getting fit but
doesn't seem fully committed, the giver is still taking a risk by
buying equipment, says Perry: "You need to be prepared for that.
Don't spend more than you are able, and if they don't use it, let it
go. If it's gathering dust, give it to someone else." To spark
interest Perry suggests focusing on the health benefits of getting in
shape, not on looks or weight. Instead, "be extremely reinforcing at
the slightest movement toward better habits."</TE>
<TE>   Buying equipment for someone truly interested in getting fit takes
a bit of planning, says LaRessa Cox, marketing manager for Busy Body
Home Fitness. She suggests considering the recipient's fitness or
weight loss goals, if there are any injuries or conditions, and if
the equipment supplements a gym membership.</TE>
<TE>   Don't ignore practical issues such as how much noise the machine
makes and how it looks: "If you're putting it in your home," says
Cox, "you don't want it to be an eyesore."</TE>
<TE>   It's best to have the person you're shopping for there to try out
equipment, but it's not always necessary, says Rick Gridley,
operations manager for Big 5 Sporting Goods in El Segundo. "With the
proper help, you should be able to pick something out," he says. "But
I wouldn't recommend going into it naively; do your research. The
Internet is a great place to start."</TE>
<TE>   Although most items can be returned, check a store's policy before
buying. Low-risk fitness gifts include balance boards and workout
balls (huge inflatable balls that can be used for stretching and
other exercises) and range from $15 to $30.</TE>
<TE>   "It's good for rank beginners and experienced athletes," says
Gridley. Not to worry if they're never used for workouts: "They're
also comfortable to sit on. We had house guests over and they all sat
on them."</TE>

<LD>This exercise works your chest and shoulder muscles. Be careful not
to pile on the weight and avoid overarching your lower back.</LD>
<LD>   1 Lie on a bench with your feet flat on the floor. You can
substitute a step bench or something of similar size at home. Hold
the dumbbells above your chest, with your arms extended.</LD>
<LD>   2 As you inhale, slowly move the dumbbells downward and outward
until they are at chest level. Do not let them move lower than
shoulder level. Keep your elbows slightly bent. On the exhale,
squeeze your chest muscles and slowly lift the dumbbells upward and
inward. When you get to the top, keep the dumbbells about a foot
apart. Pause for a second before repeating the move. A common mistake
with this exercise is lowering your arms too quickly. To avoid going
too fast, count out three to four seconds as you lower the weights,
and then again as you raise them. Make sure your head, shoulders and
hips remain on the bench during the exercise.</LD>

<HD>An Olympic goal: top the 2002 beret</HD>

<LD>The biggest shocker of the 2002 Salt Lake City Olympics wasn't Sarah
Hughes' from-behind gold medal win in women's figure skating, the
ice-skating judges scandal or the U.S. women's bobsledders'
long-awaited gold medal. It was the fact that a navy blue polar
fleece beret was fetching more than $200 on EBay. That the Roots
Olympic beret, which retailed for $19.95, was such a must-have item
that it inspired people to wait online for hours to buy one truly
embodies a marketing victory. The U.S. Olympic Committee is hoping to
achieve retail gold again even before the Athens Summer Games in 2004
by releasing a catalog of sportswear and memorabilia geared toward
the 18-to-34 set.</LD>
<LD>   Apparel: "We tried to choose items that fused sports, fashion,
style and comfort," said Toby Wong, chief marketing officer for the
U.S. Olympic Committee. "We're really trying to connect to that hip
audience for a more youthful product."</LD>
<LD>   Asked to predict a beret-like bestseller from the catalog, Wong
said she's got her eye on a cropped, zip-front, hooded jacket with
"Athens 2004" on the front. "It's hip and cool and clean."</LD>

<LD>Even though I'm working out -- walking or running on the treadmill
every day -- I've stopped losing weight. What can I do about this
plateau?</LD>
<LD>   Our bodies can be very stubborn and adaptive when it comes to
weight loss, increases in strength or even cardiovascular gains.</LD>
<LD>   The only way to combat this is to constantly change our fitness
programs, adding variation to the workouts so that our bodies don't
become too comfortable. If you've been doing 30 minutes of cardio on
the treadmill three times a week for four weeks, for example, your
rate of progress probably has stagnated.</LD>
<TE>   One solution is to cross-train, tackling other exercises. For
instance, you could take a week off from your cardio work to lift
weights or practice yoga. You also can change the amount of time you
spend on the machine, increase the intensity of the workout or take
your routine outside, such as by going for a brisk walk.</TE>
<TE>   I'm an avid runner but my hamstrings have been bothering me
lately. Do you have any suggestions for activities that will resemble
running?</TE>
<TE>   Try cross-training on a bike or Stairmaster. Sprints, or intense
activity, on a stationary bike are probably the closest approximation
of running fast, especially if you stand up while doing them.</TE>
<TE>   Sprints on the stair climber work as well. Try taking shallow
steps, then deep steps, as if you're running up and down hills. Stand
up straight and really pump your arms for maximum benefit. Also, to
avoid tight muscles and injuries, add stretching to your routine.</TE>

<HD>Gauging kids' stomachaches</HD>
<DH>When should parents call the doctor? Other symptoms,
including fever and hydration, make a difference.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jonathan Fielding and Valerie Ulene Special to The Times</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"My stomach hurts!"</LD>
<LD>   It's a complaint every parent hears -- usually more than once --
and it leads to a question every parent faces: Is it just a
stomachache or is it a sign of something more serious?</LD>
<LD>   Pediatric experts estimate that about 10% of school-age children
suffer from recurrent abdominal pain. Most of these painful episodes
are not associated with serious medical disorders, and the
overwhelming majority resolve themselves without any treatment. Poor
diet, stress or fecal retention are often to blame.</LD>
<TE>   Because stomachaches are so common, some parents ignore them. That
approach backfired on one family we know, whose son complained of
stomachaches on and off from age 6. The child seemed otherwise well
and the painful bouts improved without treatment. But at age 8, the
pain intensified, and a gastrointestinal specialist was consulted.
The doctor diagnosed Crohn's disease, a serious inflammatory
condition of the intestines. In retrospect, the child's pain was
probably caused by that disorder all along.</TE>
<TE>   So how is a parent to know if a child's stomachache will go away
by itself or if it's a sign of a medical condition that needs
treatment? The following clues can help you decide whether "watchful
waiting" is the best course or if the doctor should be called.</TE>
<TE>   * Length of pain. If the pain improves on its own within several
hours or with simple interventions such as eating or going to the
toilet, a serious medical problem is unlikely. If the pain increases
in intensity or if the child complains about it for more than two
hours, call a doctor.</TE>
<TE>   * Severity of pain. If the child continues to play normally while
complaining of abdominal pain, urgent medical attention probably
isn't needed. If, however, the child appears to be in a significant
amount of discomfort or is unable to participate in normal
activities, an examination by a physician is warranted.</TE>
<TE>   * Location of pain. It may be helpful to ask the child to point to
the area that hurts most, using only one finger. This may be
difficult to do if it's a minor stomachache, since stomachaches often
hurt all over. With some serious medical disorders -- though not all
-- the pain will be concentrated in one spot. (For example, with
appendicitis the pain characteristically begins around the
bellybutton, and then moves to the lower right side of the abdomen.)</TE>
<TE>   * Vomiting or nausea. The presence of nausea and vomiting
increases the possibility that a significant medical problem exists.
If vomiting is persistent or so severe that the child cannot keep
down enough fluid to remain well-hydrated, talk to a physician.</TE>
<TE>   * Fever. If the stomach pain is accompanied by a fever, the child
may have an infection of the gastrointestinal tract.</TE>
<TE>   * Diarrhea. Two of the most common causes of abdominal pain and
diarrhea are gastroenteritis, an infection of the gastrointestinal
tract, and food poisoning. Although both will generally improve
quickly without treatment, call a doctor if the diarrhea persists
longer than a day or two, is severe enough to cause dehydration or
contains blood.</TE>
<TE>   * Frequency and pattern of pain. Sometimes poor eating and voiding
habits can cause repeated episodes of abdominal pain, and simple
dietary changes (such as increasing fiber intake and avoiding foods
high in fat and refined sugars) can help alleviate the discomfort.
Recurrent abdominal pain is also linked to stress. So, it is not
unreasonable for a parent to wonder about psychological causes,
particularly if the child tends to complain at stressful times (like
before a test at school). However, because recurrent pain can also be
a sign of several medical disorders, the diagnosis of psychosomatic
stomachaches should never be made without a thorough medical work-up.</TE>
<TE>   If there is any question about what is causing a child's abdominal
pain, call the child's doctor or health-care provider. Often, the
doctor can determine the nature of the problem and provide
reassurance after getting answers to a few questions over the phone.
If the situation remains at all uncertain, the child should be
examined by a doctor and appropriate tests ordered.</TE>

<LD>A variety of medical conditions -- from migraines to lead poisoning
-- can cause abdominal pain. Some of them, such as gastroenteritis
and constipation, are relatively common; others, such as Crohn's
disease, ulcerative colitis and ulcer disease, are more unusual.</LD>
<LD>   Appendicitis. Abdominal pain caused by appendicitis (inflammation
of the appendix) frequently, but by no means always, begins near the
bellybutton and gradually moves down and to the right; moving or
being touched in the area typically aggravates it. Fever, nausea and
vomiting or diarrhea may accompany the pain.</LD>
<LD>   Gastroenteritis. Infections involving the gastrointestinal tract
can be quite painful and are frequently accompanied by diarrhea and
vomiting.</LD>
<TE>   Urinary tract infections. Pain associated with urinary tract
infections usually involves the lower mid-abdomen or pelvic area.
Children with UTIs may need to go to the bathroom more frequently
than usual and may complain of pain or burning when they urinate.</TE>
<TE>   Crohn's disease. This inflammatory condition of the
gastrointestinal tract causes repeated bouts of diarrhea and
abdominal pain, ranging from mild to severe. Children with Crohn's
can suffer delayed development and stunted growth.</TE>
<TE>   Ulcerative colitis. This inflammatory condition of the large
intestine can also cause recurrent diarrhea and abdominal pain. Other
common symptoms include loss of appetite and weight loss.</TE>
<TE>   Irritable bowel syndrome. This digestive disorder causes recurrent
abdominal cramping. Bloating, gas, diarrhea and constipation -- or
some combination of these problems -- are also frequently present.
The pain often gets worse with eating and improves after passing gas
or stool.</TE>
<TE>   Ulcer disease. Ulcer pain is typically located in the mid-upper
part of the abdomen or around the bellybutton. The pain often occurs
at night or in the early-morning hours and is frequently triggered by
eating.</TE>

recruiting patients. Among the trials that need more volunteers:</LD>
<LD>   Smallpox vaccine test: Researchers at Stanford University Medical
Center and Kaiser Permanente in Oakland are conducting a clinical
trial to test whether diluted doses of the smallpox vaccine produce
adequate immunity in adults who have previously been vaccinated.
People interested in volunteering should call (650) 498-7423. Kaiser
members should call (866) 604-1266.</LD>
<LD>   Ovarian cancer drug: The City of Hope Cancer Center in Duarte is
conducting a test of a new and relatively nontoxic drug, fenretinide,
which is derived from vitamin A. Researchers are seeking ovarian
cancer sufferers who have had only one prior chemotherapy program for
their cancer, and whose cancer recurred after treatment. Interested
patients should call (626) 359-8111. Ask to be connected with the
admitting referral office.</LD>
<TE>   Understanding how people recover from mania in bipolar illness:
Scientists at the UCLA Mood Disorders Research Program in Westwood
are seeking individuals with bipolar disorder, type 1, between the

<HD>BNP Paribas Raises Stake in Rival Credit Lyonnais</HD>
<DH>The French bank buys an additional 5% a week after
acquiring the government's 11% holding in an auction.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>PARIS</DL>
<LD>French bank BNP Paribas has scooped up an additional 5.32% of rival
Credit Lyonnais on top of a 10.9% stake it bought from the government
one week ago, Credit Lyonnais said Sunday.</LD>
<LD>   Lyonnais, France's No. 4 listed bank, said in a brief statement
BNP Paribas disclosed the additional purchase, adding that the shares
had been bought on the open market.</LD>
<LD>   The announcement came a week after BNP Paribas stunned the French
banking world by paying a hefty premium to buy the government stake
in an auction. With the move, it became Lyonnais' largest shareholder
and upstaged other suitors such as Credit Agricole. The latest
purchases would bring BNP's total stake to 16.22%.</LD>
<TE>   BNP Chairman Michel Pebereau last week denied any hostile
intentions toward Credit Lyonnais, saying he wanted to establish a
"close dialogue" with its management.</TE>
<TE>   While BNP waits for its purchase of the government's stake to be
cleared by French banking regulator CECEI, analysts said the extra
purchases boosted the chances of a fierce round of consolidation
after three years of calm in French banking.</TE>
<TE>   "It is clearly a blitz," a French banking analyst said of BNP's
latest share purchase.</TE>
<TE>   "This is going to be a battle of the big boys. BNP Paribas will
have to state its intentions clearly because it would need the
CECEI's approval a second time to go over 20%," said the analyst, who
asked not to be identified.</TE>
<TE>   A BNP spokeswoman confirmed that it had notified Credit Lyonnais
of the extra share purchases but declined further comment.</TE>
<TE>   Credit Lyonnais last week reacted icily to the unexpected arrival
of BNP, the euro zone's top listed bank by market value, as its
biggest shareholder. At an emergency board meeting Tuesday, directors
asked Chairman Jean Peyrelvade to find out BNP's intentions.</TE>
<TE>   Under French banking rules, BNP must inform the bank regulators of
its intentions toward Lyonnais together with its request for approval
of the outcome of last weekend's state auction.</TE>
<TE>   It was also expected to announce its ambitions toward Credit
Lyonnais in a filing to stock market regulator CMF that must come
within 15 days of the government sale being finalized.</TE>
<TE>   French companies must launch a takeover bid once they reach 33% of
a listed company's capital.</TE>

<LD>Few people watched the fight over the failed $18-billion buyout of
Hughes Electronics Corp.'s DirecTV by rival EchoStar Communications
Corp.'s Dish Network as closely as Fred Sturm.</LD>
<LD>   Sturm's California Amplifier Inc. builds the components needed to
receive and transmit images from a satellite dish onto a television
screen, and 90% of the firm's $100 million in sales come from the
nation's top two satellite-television providers.</LD>
<LD>   So as workers in one of California Amplifier's Camarillo buildings
were churning out more than 20,000 of the reception components a day
for DirecTV and Dish Network, engineers across the street were
scrambling to develop components that could work for a new, combined
company.</LD>
<TE>   The DirecTV-Dish deal was scratched this fall by the Justice
Department and the Federal Communications Commission, precluding a
year's research by California Amplifier.</TE>
<TE>   But Chief Executive Sturm had few regrets. At least his company
was ready.</TE>
<TE>   "We knew going down this road that a substantial portion of our
engineering would be wasted one way or another," he said. "If all we
got was better customer relations out of it, it was probably worth
doing."</TE>
<TE>   That sort of adaptability has helped keep California Amplifier
profitable throughout a two-year technology slump that has battered
the bottom lines of many larger companies.</TE>
<TE>   Over its 21-year history, California Amplifier has transformed
itself several times as markets shifted.</TE>
<TE>   "They've survived major lines of business effectively going to
zero and in the meantime have bulked up their core satellite business
and made that very profitable," despite it being a low-margin
business, said Rich Valera, an analyst with Needham &amp; Co.</TE>
<TE>   California Amplifier made wise acquisitions and manages its
operations efficiently, said Valera, who does not own its stock.</TE>
<TE>   The company jumped into the direct broadcast satellite, or DBS,
business in 1999 with the acquisition of Texas-based Gardiner Group,
which was already making components for DirecTV and Dish.</TE>
<TE>   Soon afterward, it moved Gardiner's plant from Texas to Camarillo.</TE>
<TE>   Despite higher labor costs and stricter workplace regulations, the
relocation was an easy decision, Sturm said. The manufacturing
facility was fashioned within a warehouse the company leases across
the street from its headquarters and design operations. That location
makes it easier for managers and engineers to keep an eye on costs
and make design adjustments quickly, Sturm said.</TE>
<TE>   Plus, as the only maker of the DBS reception components in the
United States, California Amplifier enjoys proximity to its two
biggest clients. DirecTV is based in El Segundo and EchoStar is based
in Littleton, Colo.</TE>
<TE>   "California Amplifier's proximity makes it easy for us to have
their products tested in our labs as opposed to other suppliers,"
said DirecTV spokesman Fred Mercer. "Just having them that close
improves communication."</TE>
<TE>   California Amplifier also keeps expenses in line by relying
heavily on temporary contract employees for its manufacturing.</TE>
<TE>   Contract employees can number from around 100 to 300, depending on
production needs. But overall turnover is fairly low, said spokesman
Greg Dare. The company, which also maintains design centers in other
parts of the country, employs about 250 people on a regular basis.</TE>
<TE>   California Amplifier started in 1981 making amplifiers and other
components for transmitting microwave signals, mostly for satellite
video and terrestrial broadband communications, for military and
commercial markets. It went public in December 1983 at $10 a share.</TE>
<TE>   The company provided components for the large satellite dishes
used by businesses and consumers for television reception in remote
areas where cable wasn't available. That business lost its luster
after a few years, prompting California Amplifier to take on more
military work.</TE>
<TE>   By 1991, as defense spending eased with the end of the Cold War,
the company dropped all military contracting to focus on commercial
products. A foray into two-way wireless components propelled a
spectacular but short wave of growth in the mid-1990s.</TE>
<TE>   California Amplifier introduced the first transceiver for use in
delivering high-speed Internet and cable service over the wireless
spectrum. Its fortunes surged as major telephone companies geared up
to offer wireless cable, and then two-way voice and data
transmission. But the phone companies abandoned those plans in 1996,
and California Amplifier's great times came to an abrupt halt.</TE>
<TE>   As the company grappled with that decline, Chairman and Chief
Executive Ira Coron brought in Sturm to take on the CEO role and join
him in exploring new avenues for growth. Sturm, who has an MBA from
Loyola Marymount University, had been serving as president of the
U.S. power systems division of Britain's Chloride Group.</TE>
<TE>   Sturm helped lead the push into DBS in 1999, which quickly gave
California Amplifier another boost.</TE>
<TE>   Consumers had been gravitating toward satellite television rather
than cable after satellite providers won regulatory approval to offer
local channels.</TE>
<TE>   The company expanded the business early this year with the
acquisition of satellite antenna and dish maker Kaul-Tronics Inc.,
and it now has a 40% share of the North American market for DBS
receivers.</TE>
<TE>   Annual revenue has more than doubled from the late 1990s to $117
million in fiscal 2001. It eased to $100.7 million in fiscal 2002,
which ended in February.</TE>
<TE>   California Amplifier has reported earnings growth for 11
consecutive quarters in large part because of its intensive focus on
keeping costs in line, something that Sturm says is particularly
important given the expectations of the consumer electronics
industry.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts give the company credit for its cost-efficient ways, and
for quickly addressing problems as they arise -- including an
accounting scandal involving a misstatement of results last year.</TE>
<TE>   Management had discovered a significant problem with its
accounting in March 2001. It notified regulators, worked to restate
results that had been overstated for seven quarters, and fired its
controller. The company also has settled shareholder lawsuits over
the matter, and the Securities and Exchange Commission investigation
is complete.</TE>
<TE>   In the latest quarter, California Amplifier had net income from
continuing operations of $1.8 million, or 12 cents a share, compared
with $465,000, or 3 cents, a year ago. Revenue rose 11% in the fiscal
second quarter ended Aug. 31 to $27.5 million.</TE>
<TE>   The results handily beat analysts' average estimate of 9 cents on
revenue of $24 million, according to Thomson First Call.</TE>
<TE>   California Amplifier's wireless broadband segment also contributed
to the earnings growth.</TE>
<TE>   David Kang, an analyst with Roth Capital Partners in Newport
Beach, said that segment of the company's business shows promise
because major phone companies are exploring another attempt at
providing broadband Internet access with a second-generation product.
Kang does not own shares in the company.</TE>
<TE>   Despite California Amplifier's strong profit record, its shares
have lagged because of EchoStar and Hughes' drawn-out attempt to
merge, analysts say.</TE>
<TE>   The shares closed up 12 cents at $5.62 in Nasdaq trading Friday.</TE>

<HD>Crime Pays for Advisor to Felons</HD>
<DH>After four stints in prison, a former stock swindler makes
a career of helping white-collar convicts adjust to life behind bars.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Loren Steffy</AU>
<BD>Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL>DALLAS</DL>
<LD>Ron Cohen has some advice for Andrew S. Fastow should Enron Corp.'s
former chief financial officer land in jail: "Get humble real quick."</LD>
<LD>   Cohen knows what he's talking about. A convicted stock swindler,
he has done four stints in federal prison -- almost 11 years in all.</LD>
<LD>   Nowadays, Cohen, 56, is trying to make his crimes pay: He runs
Client Advisory Group Inc., a Dallas consulting business that
prepares white-collar convicts for their stay behind bars.</LD>
<TE>   Business has been looking up lately. In October, Fastow was
indicted on charges of masterminding a fraud that led to Enron's
collapse. Other executives indicted this year include L. Dennis
Kozlowski, former chief executive of Tyco International Ltd., and
Samuel D. Waksal, former CEO of ImClone Systems Inc.</TE>
<TE>   "His services will be very much in demand," said David Irwin, a
defense attorney in Baltimore who has referred two clients to Cohen.</TE>
<TE>   For $150 an hour, Cohen tells prospective inmates what to expect
inside federal pens, how to reduce their sentences and how to adapt
to life as ex-cons.</TE>
<TE>   "Ron Cohen is the Mobil Travel Guide of prisons," said Dan
Guthrie, a Dallas defense attorney and former assistant U.S. attorney
who recently referred a client to Cohen. "He knows the system so well
that he can tell you where the accommodations are the best."</TE>
<TE>   During the '80s, Cohen, a onetime stockbroker, ran a pyramid
investment scheme that eventually landed him an 11-year sentence on
money laundering, theft and other charges. He served 4 1/2 years of
that sentence. He also has done time for passing a bad check,
laundering $15,000 for a convicted drug dealer and fleecing investors
again in the early '90s.</TE>
<TE>   "He's making a fraction of what he once did, but it's a hell of a
lot better than being in the penitentiary," said David Moore, a
former district attorney investigator who helped prosecute Cohen in
1984.</TE>

<HD>FERC to Hear Case Against El Paso</HD>
<DH>The commission will hear from the energy company and
California. A decision is expected early next year.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A fight between California and El Paso Corp. goes before the Federal
Energy Regulatory Commission today in a closely watched case to
determine whether the nation's largest pipeline company deliberately
withheld natural gas during the state's energy crisis.</LD>
<LD>   California says its utilities were overcharged by as much as $3.3
billion for natural gas to fuel their plants because El Paso
improperly capped its pipeline shipments at 79% of capacity from
November 2000 to March 2001.</LD>
<LD>   A FERC administrative law judge ruled in September that
Houston-based El Paso wrongly withheld natural gas when California
was reeling from blackouts, soaring prices and a major utility's
bankruptcy filing.</LD>
<TE>   During today's three-hour session, the company and California will
make their arguments directly to the agency's three commissioners.
The commission is expected to issue a decision early next year.</TE>
<TE>   Under FERC rules, the commissioners can accept, reject or modify
the administrative judge's initial ruling. El Paso contends that it
limited shipments to ensure the pipeline operated safely and that the
FERC judge wrongly micro-managed company decisions.</TE>
<TE>   The preliminary ruling against El Paso in September prompted
investors to dump shares, wiping out about $4 billion in market value
and triggering downgrades of its debt.</TE>
<TE>   El Paso's shares dropped last week after Moody's Investors Service
slashed the company's credit rating to "junk" status.</TE>
<TE>   On Friday, shares closed at $8.52, down 3 cents, on the New York
Stock Exchange.</TE>

<HD>Laid-Off Workers Swell Pool of Holiday Job Applicants</HD>
<DH>Retailers say they can afford to be more picky about whom
they hire as former white-collar employees vie for seasonal jobs.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jim Suhr</AU>
<BD>Associated Press</BD>
<DL>ST. LOUIS</DL>
<LD>Software manager Tim Bunce's extensive resume would not ordinarily
grace the desk of a retailer looking for part-time help. But on the
jobs front, this holiday period is anything but typical.</LD>
<LD>   Twice laid off this year in the software industry, Bunce -- a
married father of three who used to make $120,000 as a senior product
manager -- was offered seasonal work paying $15 an hour, including
commissions, at a computer store in North Carolina.</LD>
<LD>   The job didn't work out because the 35-year-old requested a week
to adjust his family schedule to the job's evening shifts. "They
wanted to get someone in there quicker," Bunce said, shrugging.</LD>
<TE>   Still, in the past people like him generally didn't apply at all.</TE>
<TE>   Amid layoffs brought on by the national economic slump, many
retailers this season say they are blessed with the richest applicant
pool in years as skilled, experienced white-collar workers consider
limited seasonal work and sometimes vie fiercely for it.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, nearly 1 million unemployed workers nationwide will
start losing jobless benefits three days after Christmas because
Congress failed to grant an extension.</TE>
<TE>   All this means that retailers are in the driver's seat.</TE>
<TE>   "Mercifully for the first time in many years, it's true -- the
pool of seasonal talent is larger," said Richard Outcalt, a partner
at Outcalt &amp; Johnson: Retail Strategists, a Seattle-based consulting
firm. "But the really good news is, it's a much better pool.</TE>
<TE>   "They're more seasoned, more dedicated, more scared, more anxious
to do a good job rather than the blase, couldn't-care-less,
just-give-me-the-paycheck-I'm-going-home attitude of part-time
seasonal employees in the retail scene that has been all too
prevalent," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Just two years ago, the tight labor market led many stores to
offer signing bonuses and premium wages to lure employees for the
critical November and December period.</TE>
<TE>   Now, retailers can afford to be picky about their holiday hires.</TE>
<TE>   "This is definitely an employer's market," said John Challenger,
chief executive of Chicago-based outplacement firm Challenger, Gray &amp;
Christmas Inc.</TE>
<TE>   Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co. expects to bolster staffing by 20% to 25% as
in years past, said spokeswoman Jan Drummond. Typically, she said,
Sears brings in 40,000 to 45,000 seasonal workers.</TE>
<TE>   "Some years are tougher to recruit, but this has been one of the
easiest," she said.</TE>
<TE>   "You can find some very good people in these times," Wal-Mart
Stores Inc. spokesman Tom Williams said.</TE>
<TE>   But at the same time, many retailers are facing lackluster sales,
and many expect hirings of seasonal workers to be up only slightly
this year, if not flat.</TE>
<TE>   From 1998 to 2000, retailers added an average of 739,000 workers
in November and December, according to the National Retail
Federation, a trade group.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, retailers added just 466,000 workers after the
terrorist attacks lowered their holiday sales expectations, and this
year the federation expects hiring to be up slightly to as many as
500,000.</TE>
<TE>   According to a survey released in November by Challenger's firm,
63% of state retail associations polled said holiday hiring by their
members probably would be down from years past, in some cases by as
much as 25%.</TE>
<TE>   Complicating matters for retailers is the uncertainty over how
they'll fare this holiday season -- and how many extra workers, if
any, they'll need. The six fewer shopping days this season don't
help.</TE>
<TE>   Some retailers deferred holiday hiring until they could see how
early sales shake out, but this year's deep labor pool gives them
flexibility to fill last-minute staffing needs, observers say.</TE>
<TE>   "This year, we're not seeing as much frenzy about Christmas
hiring," said Bob Kenzer, chief executive of Kenzer Corp., a New
York-based recruiting firm. Retailers "are not anticipating the most
robust Christmas. Surely, they aren't looking at a numbers breaker."</TE>
<TE>   Workers aren't finding all retailers that cautious.</TE>
<TE>   Connie Hurd, in her eighth year of seasonal employment in the St.
Louis area, landed temporary work this season at a Famous-Barr
department store, and within two weeks she accepted a permanent job
at the store near her home in O'Fallon, Ill.</TE>
<TE>   "I was really most delighted," said Hurd, 53, embracing the work
as a way to pick up extra Christmas cash and help finance a
daughter's college education. "This is going to come in handy."</TE>

energy suppliers, winning nearly $450 million.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>After two years of digging into whether Californians were scammed by
energy companies, after more than 110 legal actions launched in
courts and before federal regulators, California Atty. Gen. Bill
Lockyer has not produced the headline-grabbing criminal conviction
that federal prosecutors have obtained.</LD>
<LD>   But Lockyer can point to something that he says is even more
gratifying: a tidy pile of money.</LD>
<LD>   The state of California has settled several civil lawsuits against
energy suppliers for nearly $450 million in cash, assets and other
concessions. And it has used litigation as a weapon to persuade
electricity suppliers to renegotiate costly long-term power contracts
with the state.</LD>
<TE>   The lawsuits were generated by Lockyer's Energy Task Force, which
was created in 2000 with a budget of $3.5 million. (That has since
grown to $9.1 million.)</TE>
<TE>   "We're mainly focused on getting the money back," Lockyer said.
"If you just were to look at return on investment, $3.5 million to
result in a recovery of more than $400 million is pretty good."</TE>
<TE>   Lockyer, a Democrat, likes to talk tough -- at times drawing
criticism for his unrestrained comments. For example, last year he
lashed out at former Enron Corp. Chairman Kenneth L. Lay, saying, "I
would love to personally escort Lay to an 8-by-10 cell that he could
share with a tattooed dude who says, 'Hi, my name is Spike, honey.' "</TE>
<TE>   He still calls the state's major electricity and natural gas
suppliers "the four horsemen of the energy apocalypse," though their
number extends far beyond four to include AES Corp., Duke Energy
Corp., Dynegy Inc., El Paso Corp., Mirant Corp., NRG Energy Inc.,
Reliant Resources Inc. and Williams Cos. as well as Enron. The
companies have vigorously defended their behavior during California's
energy crisis.</TE>
<TE>   In a proceeding before the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission,
California contends that the state was overcharged by nearly $9
billion for electricity in 2000 and 2001. FERC, which acts as a sort
of national utility commission, has limited the time period and the
type of suppliers from which refunds might be wrung, leaving state
officials to estimate a potential recovery of $1 billion to $2
billion.</TE>
<TE>   Lockyer describes the pace of the state's twin civil and criminal
investigations as "frustratingly slow."</TE>
<TE>   He ran into early resistance, for instance, in his efforts to
subpoena documents from Enron, the world's largest energy trader
before it collapsed into bankruptcy protection. It took a year to get
Enron to comply, and then Lockyer suddenly found himself facing an
opposite problem: an excess of material to sort through.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, the disgorgement was so complete that investigators have
been left pawing through old pizza boxes, along with important lawyer
notes and other documents.</TE>
<TE>   The task force's offices in Sacramento, San Francisco and Oakland
still are crammed with more than 400 boxes of documents and more than
400 computer disks, each equivalent to at least six boxes of paper
data, said Lockyer spokesman Tom Dresslar.</TE>
<TE>   The investigation is being led by a veteran of Lockyer's office,
Senior Assistant Atty. Gen. Thomas Greene, who until recently headed
a team pressing the state's antitrust case against software giant
Microsoft Corp. Greene is being assisted in the energy probe by 16
lawyers, five analysts, one auditor and 13 legal secretaries.</TE>
<TE>   The digging has paid off.</TE>
<TE>   After federal regulators released two memos in May from Enron
lawyers describing questionable trading schemes in California, with
names such as Death Star and Fat Boy, Lockyer quickly followed with
his own explosive disclosure of Enron documents.</TE>
<TE>   Among them: working notes from meetings in October 2000 in which
Enron traders educated their lawyers about the trading strategies
that the company was using in California to boost profits. The notes
contained tantalizing fragments of conversations such as
"schemes=$10m total."</TE>
<TE>   Enron's trading tactics, documents show, included playing markets
off each other, creating phony congestion on electricity transmission
lines and submitting inflated estimates of electricity needs, only to
cut those requests at the last minute.</TE>
<TE>   Lockyer has used the documents to bolster the state's case for
electricity refunds.</TE>
<TE>   And then there are the settlements. The largest came in late
October from Williams Cos., which Lockyer valued at $425 million.
Settlements with Calpine Corp. and Constellation Energy Group Inc.
brought in $17.75 million, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Although California is pursuing a criminal investigation, Lockyer
said his approach differs from that of federal prosecutors, who like
to zero in on individuals and get them to implicate others.</TE>
<TE>   "We want to know how all the pieces fit together before we take
action," Lockyer said.</TE>
<TE>   At this point, Lockyer said, he is happy to let federal
prosecutors bring the criminal charges, as they have against former
Enron energy trader Timothy Belden, who recently pleaded guilty to
conspiracy to commit wire fraud.</TE>
<TE>   "If the feds really do that, that's fine with me," Lockyer said.
"We think the more serious problem is the billions that were drained
out of the state and the lack of investor confidence in California."</TE>

<HD>Small Stocks Hold Their Own So Far</HD>
<DH>As investors regain confidence in the market, the big
decision is what course to take in refilling their portfolios.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Tom Petruno</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Stocks of many small and mid-size companies have been a great refuge
for investors during the bear market of the last 2  1/2 years.</LD>
<LD>   But can they lead Wall Street's next phase -- whatever it turns
out to be?</LD>
<LD>   Thus far in the powerful market rally that began Oct. 10, smaller
stocks have by some measures taken a back seat to blue chips, though
marginally so.</LD>
<TE>   The Standard &amp; Poor's index of 600 small-company shares has gained
19.3% and the S&amp;P mid-size 400 index is up 20.3%.</TE>
<TE>   By contrast, the blue-chip S&amp;P 500 is up 20.5%.</TE>
<TE>   However, a broader small-stock index, the Russell 2,000, has
beaten blue chips, with a gain of 24.3% from its October low.</TE>
<TE>   The horse race is important to many investors who are trying to
decide how to configure their portfolios of individual stocks or
mutual funds amid growing optimism that the long bear market may
finally be over. Last week, the Dow Jones industrial average managed
to notch its eighth straight week of gains.</TE>
<TE>   The argument for smaller stocks -- which, of course, constitute
the vast majority of the thousands of publicly traded shares -- is
that, as a group, they usually lead coming out of bear markets.</TE>
<TE>   In 1991, for example, the Russell 2,000 index rocketed 43.7% while
the S&amp;P 500 gained 26.3%.</TE>
<TE>   But the strong performance of smaller shares in new bull markets
has stemmed in part from the fact that they usually have suffered
deeper declines than big stocks in bear markets.</TE>
<TE>   This time around, that wasn't true. The S&amp;P small and mid-size
indexes, along with the Russell 2,000, held up far better than blue
chips in 2000 and 2001, and they have again this year.</TE>
<TE>   That ended a five-year run, through 1999, during which the S&amp;P 500
reigned supreme. The winning streak pushed many blue-chip shares to
extraordinarily high valuations by early 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Now, three years of poor performance by big-name stocks could
encourage more institutional investors to bargain-hunt there, if the
economy continues to improve and hope rises about corporate earnings
growth in 2003, some analysts said.</TE>
<TE>   Steven DeSanctis, a small-stock specialist at Prudential
Securities in New York, also noted that a shift to blue chips is an
automatic move for many institutional investors as they structure
their portfolios for a better economy.</TE>
<TE>   "For pension funds, the first thing they do in reallocating money
from bonds is to go to big-capitalization stocks," DeSanctis said.</TE>
<TE>   Big-name stocks also may have more room to revive if fear of
financial scandals continues to recede, according to analysts. The
most publicized scandals of the last year involved giant companies
including Enron Corp., Tyco International Ltd. and WorldCom Inc., and
that gave investors another reason to shy away from blue chips.</TE>
<TE>   If those concerns fade, big-name stocks could regain their
historic image as being less volatile and relatively safer than
smaller stocks, said Russ Kinnel, director of mutual fund analysis
for fund-tracker Morningstar Inc. in Chicago.</TE>
<TE>   But John Rogers Jr., head of Ariel Capital Management in Chicago,
which focuses on smaller companies, argues that investors often are
less concerned about safety, and more concerned about opportunity, as
faith in the economy returns.</TE>
<TE>   "I think smaller-cap stocks will outperform large-cap because as
people get more confident about the economy -- that the recovery is
real -- they will be more comfortable taking the higher risk that
smaller-cap entails," Rogers said.</TE>
<TE>   He said he favors such mid-size companies as retailer Tiffany &amp;
Co. and banking firm Northern Trust Corp.</TE>
<TE>   Which market sector is cheaper based on valuation measures such as
price-to-earnings ratios?</TE>
<TE>   Calculating overall P/E ratios for major indexes is a dicey
business, because in trying to represent all stocks in the index an
overall P/E may end up representing only a hypothetical stock.</TE>
<TE>   But for what they're worth, P/Es based on estimated earnings per
share for the S&amp;P 500 and the S&amp;P 600 over the next four quarters
show the two sectors valued about the same (around 19 times
earnings), according to Bloomberg News.</TE>
<TE>   Kinnel said the valuation parity reflects the strong relative
performance of smaller stocks over the last three years, which has
lifted many of the shares from dirt-cheap territory in 1999.</TE>
<TE>   A central question now is whether earnings growth in 2003 will be
better at larger companies or smaller companies, on balance.</TE>
<TE>   Historically, investors have viewed many smaller companies as
generally having more pricing power because the companies tend to
serve niche markets.</TE>
<TE>   But Peter Larson, manager of the Liberty Small Cap Fund in Boston,
said that although he has heard more lately about companies trying to
raise prices, "I don't detect a whole lot of optimism about price
increases sticking."</TE>
<TE>   That's one reason why "the biggest challenge now is finding cheap
stocks where you have some conviction about prospects" for earnings
gains in 2003, he said.</TE>
<TE>   One sector where he has made some bets is trucking, Larson said.
Companies such as Arkansas Best Corp. "have had to really run their
businesses better" to generate earnings without the benefit of sales
growth, he said.</TE>
<TE>   If the economy accelerates in 2003, lifting truckers' sales, the
gains could flow directly to the bottom line, Larson said.</TE>
<TE>   For individual investors who are trying to decide among mutual
funds that favor small, mid-size or blue-chip stocks, they also must
decide between funds in each sector that are more value oriented and
those that are more growth oriented.</TE>
<TE>   Just as smaller stocks have outperformed bigger stocks during the
last three years, value stocks have trounced growth stocks, as
investors have fled high P/E issues (especially in technology) for
more reasonably valued stocks in more-stable, often slower-growing
businesses.</TE>
<TE>   So far this year, for example, the average small-cap value mutual
fund is down 7.5%, while the average small-cap growth fund is down
23.4%, according to Morningstar.</TE>
<TE>   Likewise, the average large-cap value fund is down 15.2% this
year, while the average large-cap growth fund is off 22.6%.</TE>
<TE>   But Prudential's DeSanctis said that growth stocks usually lead
value stocks coming out of market downturns, as investors' enthusiasm
resurges.</TE>
<TE>   Plus, added Kinnel, with value in its third year of superior
performance to growth, "I think growth is more on sale now."</TE>

<HD>In Search of a Martha Stewart Replacement</HD>
<DH>B. Smith, Nigella Lawson and Anne McKevitt have a chance of
becoming the next top lifestyle brand.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Adam Pasick</AU>
<BD>Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Wanted: Domestic lifestyle advice from a telegenic personality.
Magazine, line of retail products and a squeaky-clean stock portfolio
a plus.</LD>
<LD>   With Martha Stewart hamstrung by an investigation into alleged
insider trading, branding experts say the door is open for a flock of
tastemakers to push their own mass-market cooking, decorating and
gardening advice.</LD>
<LD>   At the head of the pack are New York-based restaurateur B. Smith
and two British imports, "domestic goddess" cooking guru Nigella
Lawson and interior decorator to the stars Anne McKevitt.</LD>
<TE>   But despite Stewart's difficulties, including the possibility of
criminal charges, the challengers may find it difficult to displace
her as top dog.</TE>
<TE>   "Martha rose up in a vacuum," said David Martin, president of
brand consultant Interbrand. "It may well be that there's not one new
home run star but a lot of top players."</TE>
<TE>   McKevitt has in the works an interior decorating television show
and a line of paints, crafts and linens to be sold through a
yet-unnamed retailer. Her show will feature some of her celebrity
friends and clients, who include Paul McCartney, Catherine Deneuve
and Elton John. But don't look for cooking advice: The strict
vegetarian, McKevitt, confesses that she can't cook to save her life.</TE>
<TE>   "I want the show to be sort of beyond the red carpet for
celebrities," she said. "I'll ask them 'What's in your fridge?'
What's under your bed?" '</TE>
<TE>   A red head with a Scottish burr, McKevitt has even been drawing
attention from within Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia Inc., where
Stewart is chairwoman and chief executive.</TE>
<TE>   McKevitt denied in a written statement that her company had hired
any Martha Stewart executives, but cryptically added that "we have
recently been approached by an individual seeking employment and
currently having living brand experience in the home/lifestyle area."</TE>
<TE>   A spokesman for Martha Stewart Living declined to comment.</TE>
<TE>   Facing investigations by the Securities and Exchange Commission
and the Justice Department into her sale of stock in ImClone Systems,
Stewart has lowered her profile in recent months. Her company has
said the scandal is hurting nearly every aspect of its business.</TE>
<TE>   That could represent an opportunity for up-and-coming rivals such
as B. Smith, a former model who owns three restaurants, has a
syndicated television show and touts a Bed Bath &amp; Beyond line of
linens, shower curtains and other housewares that are comparable to
Stewart's popular line at the retailer Kmart, which filed for
bankruptcy protection this year.</TE>
<TE>   "The target audience has always been women, and B. Smith can
appeal to women from East Hampton to East St. Louis," said Dan Gasby,
her husband and business partner. "She'll catch Martha. People have
always called B. Smith the African American Martha Stewart, but one
day in the near future they'll say 'Martha does what B. does." '</TE>
<TE>   Carol Parish, a partner at the brand consulting firm Lippincott &amp;
Margulies, likes the chances of Nigella Lawson, who has been
increasingly visible in the U.S. with a cookbook, television show and
guest cooking column in the New York Times.</TE>
<TE>   "She has the classic good looks and upper-scale demeanor.... She's
promoting herself as a domestic goddess and saying it's all about
happiness, not total perfection," Parish said.</TE>
<TE>   The well-oiled brand-building machinery at Martha Stewart Living
Omnimedia could also boost one of the company's own staffers to
stardom, including Creative Director Gael Towey or Chief Operating
Officer Sharon Patrick.</TE>

<HD>Messier Maps Plan to Rebut Allegations</HD>
<DH>Vivendi Universal's former chairman denies claims that he
misled investors or acted without board approval.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Richard Verrier</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Vivendi Universal's ousted chairman, Jean-Marie Messier, is
marshaling an elaborate response to allegations that he built the
company into a global media behemoth by bamboozling investors and
even his own board members.</LD>
<LD>   At the center of criminal and civil probes in the U.S. and France
are allegations that Messier misled investors by issuing upbeat
statements earlier this year that hid Vivendi's cash crisis, and
acted without board approval when he spent billions of dollars to buy
back company shares.</LD>
<LD>   With his reputation in the balance, Messier is preparing a
detailed rebuttal that focuses on three points, sources close to the
former investment banker say:</LD>
<TE>   * In the brief window between Messier's June 26 assurances that
Vivendi faced no liquidity crisis and his successor's disclosure
indicating otherwise, one lender terminated a nearly $1-billion
backup credit line and another refused to extend new financing after
a $740-million loan matured.</TE>
<TE>   * Vivendi board minutes show that directors approved a plan to buy
back up to 10% of the company's shares and had given Messier
authorization to carry out the transactions.</TE>
<TE>   * Vivendi's new chief financial officer, Jacques Espinasse, told
board members at a Sept. 25 meeting that he discovered no evidence of
accounting fraud or misleading financial disclosures by the company
or its representatives. Messier, sources say, has seized on
Espinasse's findings to bolster his claim that he did nothing wrong.</TE>
<TE>   Although he has not been identified as a suspect or target of the
probes, Messier's actions and financial disclosures during his
18-month reign at Vivendi Universal are at the center of four
separate investigations by the U.S. attorney's office for the
Southern District of New York, the Securities and Exchange
Commission, French stock market regulators and the Paris prosecutor's
office.</TE>
<TE>   Messier and Vivendi are also named in 16 shareholder lawsuits
filed in California, New York and Paris.</TE>
<TE>   Interviews with sources both inside and outside Vivendi, as well
as board meeting records obtained by The Times, suggest that U.S. and
French prosecutors could face a complex task in building a case
against Messier or the company under his leadership.</TE>
<TE>   "This is anything but a clear-cut case," said securities law
specialist Christopher Bebel, a former attorney for the SEC who has
consulted for the Justice Department, when told of the response that
Messier is apparently preparing to lay out. "It looks like a defense
lawyer's dream."</TE>
<TE>   Bebel and other legal experts note that it remains to be seen what
evidence the authorities ultimately may bring against Messier and any
other Vivendi executives, and whether his claims will hold up to
their scrutiny.</TE>
<TE>   Messier's position may be undermined by, among other things,
internal documents showing that he repeatedly clashed with Guillaume
Hannezo, Vivendi's former chief financial officer. Hannezo expressed
concern as early as last winter over the breakneck pace of Vivendi's
acquisitions and debt, according to records seized by French
authorities.</TE>
<TE>   Some investors remain convinced that Messier bears prime
responsibility for Vivendi's woes.</TE>
<TE>   "He took too many risks with the money of others," said Colette
Neuville, who heads a group of minority Vivendi shareholders. "He
didn't give enough information ... about the risks he was taking."</TE>
<TE>   During his tenure, Messier went on a buying spree that included
snapping up Universal's movie studio, theme parks and record labels.
That left Vivendi with a crippling $19-billion media debt load, which
helped send the company's stock price tumbling more than 75%.</TE>
<TE>   The vice chairman of Vivendi's board, Edgar Bronfman Jr., whose
family is the largest single investor in the company and who led the
boardroom coup against Messier, declined to comment. In the past,
though, Bronfman has made it clear that he too feels betrayed by the
45-year-old former executive.</TE>
<TE>   But Messier's European attorney, Olivier Metzner, said he is
confident that Messier will be vindicated.</TE>
<TE>   "They don't really know what they're looking for. It's kind of
looking like a fishing expedition," Metzner said of the probes.
"We're expecting the investigations in France to establish that all
of the accusations made against Messier were ill-founded."</TE>
<TE>   Messier, who is said to be close to hiring a U.S. criminal defense
lawyer, declined to comment. At a recent news conference to promote
his new book, however, he was defiant.</TE>
<TE>   "Vivendi is no Enron," he said, referring to the fallen U.S.
energy trader, "so I am not afraid to go to jail. Let the judges do
their job."</TE>
<TE>   A Vivendi Universal spokeswoman would say only that the company is
cooperating fully with the investigations.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. authorities are apparently seeking to determine whether
Vivendi and its officers violated the anti-fraud provision of the
Securities and Exchange Act of 1934. The provision prohibits a
company or its representatives from concealing material information
that would have affected investors' decisions on whether to buy or
sell the company's stock. Violators face up to 10 years in prison and
a maximum $1 million in fines. A company can be fined up to $2.5
million.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities aren't commenting on their probes, but sources
familiar with the investigations say they are concentrating on what
Messier and other officers knew about the company's liquidity crisis,
when they knew it and what they conveyed to shareholders.</TE>
<TE>   Investigators are expected to pay special attention to Messier's
actions after emerging from a tumultuous June 25 board meeting. In a
detailed statement he issued the next day, Messier said, "Vivendi is
confident of its capacity to meet its anticipated obligations over
the next 12 months."</TE>
<TE>   During a conference call with analysts later that day, he
downplayed market fears that the company was in a cash crunch.</TE>
<TE>   But less than a week later, Messier was forced out by the board
and replaced by a new chief executive, Jean-Rene Fourtou. Within
hours of taking over the helm, Fourtou learned that he faced "a
terrible liquidity crisis," he would later tell analysts.</TE>
<TE>   "If Mr. Messier had stayed, the company would have gone bankrupt
in 10 days," Fourtou also told French officials in a government
hearing on Vivendi's fall.</TE>
<TE>   Certainly, there was evidence at the time Messier delivered his
statement that Vivendi was facing possible cash problems. At the June
25 meeting, for example, the board hotly debated a Goldman Sachs
report on the company's financial situation that laid out various
scenarios, including one that warned Vivendi could face serious
financial problems if it could not sell assets or issue bonds.</TE>
<TE>   But Vivendi's financial picture grew far more bleak in the days
after the board meeting and the sanguine outlook delivered by
Messier. Messier is expected to argue that he could not have foreseen
the dramatic changes that were about to unfold.</TE>
<TE>   Less than a week after his June 26 statements, German lender
Bayerische Landesbank rescinded a nearly $1-billion backup line of
credit to Vivendi, a bank source familiar with the matter confirmed.</TE>
<TE>   Making matters worse was the refusal by the British bank Barclays
to extend new financing after a $740-million line of credit matured.
There are conflicting reports of when that refusal came. A source at
Barclays said it was June 24. Another Vivendi document puts the date
at June 28. Either way, two sources close to Vivendi's former
management team say that Hannezo, the former chief financial officer,
did not alert Messier that negotiations to extend the loan had failed
until Messier's ouster on July 1. Hannezo declined to comment.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Vivendi's top lenders, including Deutsche Bank and BNP
Paribas, also were unwilling to provide any new financing amid the
boardroom turmoil, according to banking and company sources.</TE>
<TE>   "The banks just didn't trust Messier, and they were not confident
that he had the right strategy," said one European banker close to
Vivendi. "They were just not prepared to lend fresh money for his
business."</TE>
<TE>   A spokesman for Deutsche Bank declined to comment. Officials at
BNP Paribas couldn't immediately be reached. But Messier, sources
close to him say, contends that he wasn't aware of this situation
until after he had issued his statements on June 26.</TE>
<TE>   Simon Murray, a private equity investor based in Hong Kong and a
former Vivendi board member whose tenure as a director overlapped
with Messier's, says he is convinced that Messier was truly in the
dark about the banks' actions.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think Messier was aware that the banks were going to pull
the plug," Murray said.</TE>
<TE>   The final blow came on July 1 when Moody's Investor Service
downgraded Vivendi to "junk" status, questioning its ability to
reduce debt as planned.</TE>
<TE>   The timing could work in Messier's favor, said Bebel, the
securities law specialist: "If the company's financial status
declined markedly in the wake of his statement, it makes it a tougher
case for the government."</TE>
<TE>   Authorities also are investigating allegations that Messier
concealed from board members and Hannezo about $6 billion in
purchases of Vivendi stock that he oversaw in 2000 and 2001.</TE>
<TE>   Metzner, Messier's attorney, counters that the board was fully
apprised of his client's actions, noting that the purchases were part
of a plan formally adopted by shareholders in 2000. The plan outlined
specific goals, including buying back shares to stabilize their price
and for use in acquisitions and employee stock options.</TE>
<TE>   In December 2000, the board gave Messier the specific authority to
carry out that plan. In June 2001, Messier and Hannezo updated the
board on the progress of the share buybacks, records show. The
company also filed monthly reports of its share purchases with
France's stock market regulator, Metzner said.</TE>
<TE>   "The board of directors cannot argue that they were unaware of
Messier's actions," Metzner said.</TE>
<TE>   Murray, the former director, agrees. Messier can be criticized for
"his enthusiasm, his ego and for growing the company too fast,"
Murray said, "but not on grounds of misleading the board."</TE>
<TE>   Other Vivendi directors, for their part, say they still felt
blindsided to learn that billions of dollars were being spent to buy
shares, adding to the company's already significant debts, according
to sources close to the board.</TE>
<TE>   They contend that it was Messier's obligation to consult with them
more fully about the program and its repercussions.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, Hannezo sharply disagreed with Messier on the wisdom
of the share buybacks, and at one point he established procedures in
his department to prevent Messier from placing orders. The former CFO
eventually reached a compromise with Messier to curtail the costly
share buybacks, sources close to the former management team say.</TE>
<TE>   In his new book, "My True Diary," Messier said none of Hannezo's
warnings went unheeded and that he respected his provocative style.
The two, who both worked at the French finance ministry in the 1980s,
have been friends for years.</TE>
<TE>   Messier does concede in his book that he made mistakes at Vivendi,
including overextending the company with too many acquisitions and
drawing too much attention to himself and his jet-set lifestyle
straddling Paris and New York.</TE>
<TE>   But Messier largely blames his demise on market rumors and a
coterie of influential French businessmen who were offended by his
Hollywood lifestyle and his perceived slights toward French culture.</TE>
<TE>   As for his own conduct, Messier makes no apologies, asserting in
the introduction of his book: "I have nothing to hide."</TE>

<HD>U.S. Currency Will Be Getting a Touch of Color</HD>
<DH>Bills due to go into circulation starting next fall will
have different hues. The change is part of an effort to thwart savvy
counterfeiters.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jeannine Aversa</AU>
<BD>Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The last time Andrew Jackson got a makeover, he ended up with a big
head, slightly off-center. This time, he will get a little color.</LD>
<LD>   The most noticeable features of the last redesign of U.S. currency
-- the oversized, off-center portraits -- produced all kinds of
derisive nicknames: funny money, Monopoly money, cartoon money.</LD>
<LD>   Color is coming, and government money makers are hoping for a
warmer reception for the changes. The new $20, with its public
unveiling set for the spring, is supposed to be in circulation as
early as next fall.</LD>
<TE>   Jackson is first in line for a makeover. After the new $20 makes
its debut, the new $50 (Ulysses S. Grant) and the $100s (Benjamin
Franklin) will follow within 18 months.</TE>
<TE>   In the works is a five-year effort, costing up to $53 million, to
educate people about the changes. An important goal is to help
distinguish between genuine greenbacks and bogus bills.</TE>
<TE>   "If we learned anything from the issuance of the $20 in 1998, it
is that things that we get used to here, because we see it and work
on it, when it is first in the hands of the public it is seen as
dramatic," said Thomas Ferguson, director of the Bureau of Engraving
and Printing. "Suddenly, we are asking them to accept something
else."</TE>
<TE>   Portrait engraver Thomas Hipschen, who is working on the current
redesign, remembers spending countless hours during the last makeover
meticulously cutting into steel by hand the portraits of Jackson,
Franklin and Grant for the new bills.</TE>
<TE>   Relieved at first when the work was done, he then worried about
the public reaction to the changes.</TE>
<TE>   "You worry about what the press is going to do," he said. "I have
an old clipping file about all the horrible things they said about
the portraits that I engraved. Some fun things too."</TE>
<TE>   Everyone is a critic.</TE>
<TE>   "Well, you are not going to please everybody. This is a situation
where everybody is going to weigh in on it," Hipschen said. "You
really have to have a thick skin, I think. But I don't really take it
to heart that much."</TE>
<TE>   To give the new bills color, the bureau has had to buy five
printing presses, to operate in Washington and at a bureau facility
in Fort Worth. To run the new presses, Ferguson said, some existing
workers are getting trained, and a few new people have been hired.
The Fort Worth plant is being expanded, providing room for the new
presses and space for public tours, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Adding color to the notes is a challenge.</TE>
<TE>   "It is new, and anything that is new provides another opportunity
to do well -- or not," Ferguson said. "There can be color variations
that we wouldn't get with a single color ink, like when we use black
or green. So there are additional inspection requirements."</TE>
<TE>   Green and black ink is now used on neutral-colored paper. With the
makeover, color tints will be added in the neutral areas of the note.
Ferguson would not say which colors will be used, but said they will
vary by denomination.</TE>
<TE>   Money makers want the new notes to have an American look and feel,
and not be confused with, for instance, the colorful euro, the paper
currency of the European Union.</TE>
<TE>   "When we look at something as fundamentally revolutionary as
adding color, going from a currency system that has been
monochromatic certainly for all of our lives, our parents' lives ...
we want to do it in a responsible way that recognizes that
tradition," Ferguson said. "So that when people around the world see
that first new U.S. $20, they will know it as a U.S. $20."</TE>
<TE>   Recent changes in paper money design have been driven by the
desire to thwart high-tech counterfeiters. Over the years,
counterfeiters have graduated from offset printing to increasingly
sophisticated color copiers, computer scanners, color ink jet
printers and publishing-grade software, all readily available.</TE>
<TE>   Some anti-counterfeiting features included in the last redesign
will be retained, the bureau said. They include watermarks that are
visible when held up to a light; embedded security threads that glow
a color when exposed to an ultraviolet light; and minute images,
visible with a magnifying glass, known as microprinting.</TE>
<TE>   The new notes may sport more distinct color-shifting ink. In the
last redesign, color-shifting ink that looks green when viewed
straight on but black at an angle was used in a spot on some notes.</TE>
<TE>   Even after the greenbacks' last makeover, which started with a
revamped Franklin on the $100 in 1996 and ended with new $5s and $10s
in 2000, some collectors still complained that U.S. currency is
boring.</TE>
<TE>   Ferguson has a different take.</TE>
<TE>   "Our notes now, in the highest sense of the word, are
utilitarian," he said. "U.S. currency is a continuum of design,
versus a revolution of design."</TE>
<TE>   Under the redesign, the size of the notes will not change and the
same faces will appear on the same bills. But the portraits and
buildings may be presented differently.</TE>
<TE>   Hipschen said if he were king for a day, he would put Duke
Ellington on one of the bills, would replace all the portraits with
different American figures and would make notes longer as they
increase in denomination.</TE>
<TE>   "We could have gone where no man had gone before," he joked.</TE>

<HD>Online Retailers Look for Big Day</HD>
<DH>Consumers returning to work -- and their computers -- after
the holiday weekend are expected to boost sales.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>David Colker</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Online retailers racked up unexpectedly strong numbers the day after
Thanksgiving, which had not previously been a stellar day for
electronic commerce. It's an indication that the totals for today --
when consumers return to work and to their computers after the
holiday weekend -- would be even stronger.</LD>
<LD>   ComScore Networks Inc., which tracks online sales, estimated that
Internet shoppers spent $195.6 million on Friday, a 30% increase over
the day after Thanksgiving last year.</LD>
<LD>   That total includes spending on tickets for travel. The increase
in non-travel purchases was more impressive -- $150.9 million, or 40%
over the same day last year.</LD>
<TE>   BizRate.com, which monitors 2,000 online merchants, issued a
rosier estimate that claimed online sales for the day totaled $234.2
million, up 61% over last year.</TE>
<TE>   Although Thanksgiving-plus-one is almost always a big day for
bricks-and-mortar retailers, it has not been particularly rewarding
for e-commerce. The Monday after Thanksgiving typically has been a
bigger online retail day. Don't tell the boss, but the reason is that
more than 60% of online purchases are made by people at work.</TE>
<TE>   "So many people now use computers at their offices that it's easy
for them to make their purchases there," said ComScore researcher Max
Kalehoff. "They are kind of held hostage anyway, and often it's where
they have a faster connection. It's convenient."</TE>
<TE>   This year, an increase in the number of people using the Internet
to make purchases gave Friday its heft.</TE>
<TE>   "We are seeing a 30% increase in Internet shoppers over last
year," ComScore Vice President Dan Hess said Sunday. "We also now
have data showing that people who have been already shopping online
are this year doing more of it and making bigger purchases."</TE>
<TE>   This bodes well for today, Hess said. "Stay tuned. The Monday
after Thanksgiving is usually a big day, when people get back to
their broadband connections at work," he said.</TE>
<TE>   If online sales continue rising this shopping season, the one-day
record could be broken handily. ComScore places that record at $262
million in non-travel goods, established last year on Dec. 12, a
Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   But Kalehoff cautioned that online merchants shouldn't gloat. Yet.</TE>
<TE>   "There has been a lot of volatility from week to week," he said of
e-commerce figures. "That suggests a fragile economy. One week
consumers feel good and the next week they don't. We are getting
mixed signals."</TE>
<TE>   Earlier this year, ComScore predicted that fourth-quarter online
sales for non-travel products would increase 27% over last year to
$13.8 billion.</TE>

<HD>Rewriting the Script</HD>
<DH>Motion-capture technology will allow Hollywood to change
the definition of live action -- and a whole lot more.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>P.J. Huffstutter</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>If there were ever a director who enjoyed pushing the boundaries of
technology in filmmaking, it's Robert Zemeckis.</LD>
<LD>   For his 1988 movie "Who Framed Roger Rabbit," he blurred the line
between animation and live action. In the 1994 blockbuster "Forrest
Gump," he blurred the line even more as images of star Tom Hanks'
character were inserted seamlessly into old newsreel footage. That
allowed Forrest Gump to be seen conversing with John Lennon and
shaking John F. Kennedy's hand.</LD>
<LD>   Now, Zemeckis is threatening to go further still, changing the
very core of the moviemaking process in a little-known project called
"The Polar Express."</LD>
<TE>   The plan this time is to create a live-action movie without
filming any true "live" action.</TE>
<TE>   All of the scenes in "The Polar Express" will be shot with digital
cameras in front of a blank screen, with sets to be filled in later
by computers. The actors will be covered in motion-capture sensors so
that each move of an arm, each flicker of an eyelid and each wrinkle
of a lip will be stored on a computer and used as guide for the
digital animators who will create the actual movie footage.</TE>
<TE>   Expected to hit theaters in 2004 or 2005 with Hanks again in a
starring role, "The Polar Express" is creating a buzz among
technophiles, who are fascinated by Zemeckis' grand vision. It's also
raising eyebrows among the entertainment industry's labor unions,
which are concerned that an all-digital production may cut their
members out of the process.</TE>
<TE>   Based on the acclaimed children's book by "Jumanji" author Chris
Van Allsburg, "The Polar Express" is about a boy who refuses to give
up his belief in Santa Claus despite incessant teasing from his
friends. On Christmas Eve, a steam train shows up and whisks the boy
and his disbelieving pals off to the North Pole. Hanks plays the
train conductor.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike digitally animated movies such as "Final Fantasy" and
"Shrek," which relied heavily on motion-capture technology to create
fictitious characters, the team behind "Polar Express" is striving to
create images that actually look like the well-known actors who will
"star" in the film.</TE>
<TE>   The work is complicated. Take, for example, the creation of the
children's characters.</TE>
<TE>   Some of those roles will be filled by actual child actors. But
others will be completely virtual, including one who represents
Hanks' conductor character as a boy. The crew has spent nearly a year
experimenting on ways to map Hanks' current facial and muscle
structure. They plan to mix that data with photographs of the actor
in his youth and backward engineer a virtual child that will resemble
the adult Hanks.</TE>
<TE>   "This is an ambitious, exciting project for us," said Martin
Shafer, chairman and chief executive of Castle Rock Entertainment,
the studio behind the movie. "We've seen the early tests, and it's
like nothing I've ever seen."</TE>
<TE>   In many ways, "The Polar Express" represents the future of
Hollywood, where emerging digital technology is redefining everything
from the equipment used on a set to the contracts workers sign to the
definition of the jobs they take.</TE>
<TE>   The team behind the movie understands these shifting boundaries
all too well. Though the project still is in pre-production, it
already has attracted the attention of labor union officials, who
worry that their members will be tapped to handle duties outside
their contract's strict job definitions -- or be excluded from the
movie altogether.</TE>
<TE>   The Directors Guild of America, for example, fears that the
all-digital shoot won't hire the number of crew members that are
typically contractually required for a big-budget, live-action
feature film.</TE>
<TE>   "If I'm Bob Zemeckis, I don't really need assistant directors on
this because there's not much for them to do," said Bryan Unger,
Western executive director of the DGA, who added that he has
approached the producers of "The Polar Express" to air his concerns.
"If this movie is all really being done in a computer, how much of a
crew do I need to hire?"</TE>
<TE>   Executives of Imagemovers, Zemeckis' production company, declined
to discuss the movie.</TE>
<TE>   Another issue being watched closely in Hollywood is the movie's
price tag. Studio executives say the budget is set around $150
million.</TE>
<TE>   But some project insiders and technology experts insist that this
is a low-ball figure, and that the sums involved could easily grow to
rival the likes of "Titantic," "Pearl Harbor" and "Waterworld,"
turning "The Polar Express" into one of the most expensive movies
ever made. One of the reasons for that is, with shooting scheduled to
begin in less than three months, some of the high-tech tools needed
to make the film are still being developed.</TE>
<TE>   Sony Pictures Imageworks, the visual effects giant in Culver City
that has been tapped to handle the movie, also has a lot riding on
the success of "The Polar Express." More than a quarter of the
revenue the company will report next year is expected to come from
the movie. Company executives also declined to comment on the
project.</TE>
<TE>   If his previous efforts are any indication, Zemeckis loves a
gamble -- and "The Polar Express" certainly is a big one.</TE>
<TE>   Studio insiders say he is plunging into the production unsure of
whether crucial effects -- upon which the success of the movie hinges
-- actually can be executed. "The whole film rests on whether this
illusion works or not," Zemeckis told The Times in 1994, referring to
"Forrest Gump." "All you can hope for is for technology to save us."</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva makes his first trip abroad as Brazil's
president-elect this week, traveling to Argentina and Chile to
strengthen regional ties before a U.S. visit a week later.</LD>
<LD>   A little more than a month after his election victory, the trip
will be a test of whether the former union leader can re-create his
surprising success at home on the international front.</LD>
<LD>   Throughout his campaign Lula stressed the importance of rebuilding
trade links between Brazil and its Latin American neighbors, which
are comparatively small and have been hit by economic and political
turmoil.</LD>
<TE>   Lula and a small team of advisors are scheduled to meet with
Argentine President Eduardo Duhalde today and Chilean President
Ricardo Lagos on Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   He will meet with President Bush on Dec. 10.</TE>
<TE>   At the heart of Lula's determination to strengthen South American
ties is the desire to present a united front against the U.S. in
negotiations to create a free-trade area stretching from Alaska to
Argentina.</TE>

<HD>Monthly Manufacturing, Jobless Figures Due</HD>

<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News, Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Investors will be looking at post-holiday economic data this week,
including an expected increase in November manufacturing output and
unemployment numbers.</LD>
<LD>   But caveats abound, the biggest involving the sharp run-up in the
three major market gauges since they touched five-year lows in early
October, especially the surge in the technology-rich Nasdaq.</LD>
<LD>   A conference call with analysts by Finland's mobile phone maker
Nokia Corp. and a Credit Suisse First Boston annual technology
conference on technology stocks in Scottsdale, Ariz., could provide
news this week to take the wind out of tech stocks.</LD>
<TE>   Nokia, whose shares have surged 83% since touching an almost
four-year intra-day low of $10.51 on July 24, will discuss the
company's prospects for 2003 with analysts in New York on Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   The CSFB conference that starts today and ends Thursday also could
provide companies an outlet to make announcements, which could give
investors an excuse to sell.</TE>
<TE>   The conference, which features 100 companies, is expected to draw
top executives from Dell Computer Corp.,  Microsoft Corp. and Veritas
Software Corp.</TE>
<TE>   A sign of what the Federal Reserve has called a "soft spot" in
recent economic growth may be seen in the release of U.S.
manufacturing data today.</TE>
<TE>   Economists, on average, expect the Institute for Supply
Management's manufacturing index to pop up to 51.3 in November from
48.5 in October -- the first time since August that the survey has
come in above the critical 50 level that signals growth.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the Labor Department is expected to report Friday that
employment increased by 30,000 in November after 18,000 jobs were
lost in the previous two months, putting the unemployment rate at
5.8%.</TE>
<TE>   Other economic reports this week:</TE>
<TE>   * Today, the Commerce Department will report on October
construction spending.</TE>
<TE>   * Wednesday, the Labor Department will report on third-quarter
productivity.</TE>
<TE>   The Commerce Department will report on October factory orders.</TE>

<HD>Ruling on UAL Loan Guarantee Imminent</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A ruling is expected any day on United Airlines' application for a
$1.8-billion federal loan guarantee.</LD>
<LD>   The airline's parent, UAL Corp., says it needs approval to secure
$2 billion in private loans. Without the loan guarantee, United has
said it would have no choice but to file for Bankruptcy Court
protection.</LD>
<LD>   Over the weekend, United and its mechanics union met behind closed
doors as the nation's No. 2 carrier pressed for hundreds of millions
of dollars in cost cuts.</LD>
<TE>   The mechanics last week rejected a package of steep wage and
benefit cuts that United says are necessary if it is to land the
federal loan guarantee.</TE>
<TE>   United spokesman Jeff Green confirmed the meeting but said the
airline would not discuss any aspect of the talks.</TE>
<TE>   The meeting came a day after the airline's 24,000 flight
attendants agreed to $412 million in wage concessions. However, that
deal and other cost-cutting agreements accepted by United's pilots
and other employee groups will expire Dec. 31 unless the mechanics
sign on.</TE>
<TE>   United is seeking $5.2 billion in companywide labor cuts over 5
1/2 years. The mechanics' proposed share is believed to be $600
million to $700 million.</TE>
<TE>   The cash-strapped airline also must decide whether it can make a
$375-million debt payment today, although under a grace period it
could push that deadline to Dec. 16. Its cash reserves are believed
to be about $1 billion and on a pace to run out this winter.</TE>

<HD>European Central Bank Expected to Lower Rates</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The European Central Bank is expected to lower interest rates for the
first time in more than a year this week to boost faltering economic
growth, analysts said.</LD>
<LD>   The ECB's 18 policymakers will reduce the benchmark rate by as
much as half a percentage point to a three-year low of 2.75% when
they meet Thursday, according to the forecast of 30 economists
surveyed by Bloomberg News.</LD>
<LD>   Consumer confidence in the region fell to the lowest level in more
than five years this month, a European Commission survey showed
Friday.</LD>
<TE>   Economic growth this year will be the slowest in nine years, the
commission forecast.</TE>
<TE>   "The economic recovery in Europe has stalled," said Bernd Kubista,
chief economist of the BVR association of German cooperative banks,
which represents more than 1,500 lenders. "Germany in particular will
have a very bad start to 2003."</TE>
<TE>   German business confidence fell to a 10-month low in November.
Deutsche Telekom, Europe's No. 1 phone company, this month posted the
continent's biggest quarterly loss.</TE>
<TE>   At least 10 ECB officials have signaled that a rate cut is
imminent, saying they expect price increases to wane. The ECB aims to
keep inflation, which slowed to 2.2% in November, below 2%.</TE>
<TE>   Also Thursday, the Bank of England is expected to leave its key
lending rate at 4%, the lowest in almost four decades, all 30
economists surveyed by Bloomberg News said.</TE>

<HD>Crime Experts Team Up on Energy Fraud Probe</HD>
<DH>The investigation of market manipulation has gained
momentum under a former judge and an old FBI hand.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Nancy Rivera Brooks</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Kevin V. Ryan and Mark J. Mershon know a thing or two about bad guys.</LD>
<LD>   Ryan, U.S. attorney for the Northern District of California, once
successfully prosecuted an Oakland man who stabbed his mother 63
times, killed her dog, stole her television and set her apartment on
fire.</LD>
<LD>   Mershon, special agent in charge of the San Francisco division of
the FBI, was separated by only a van door from the killer of
12-year-old Polly Klaas, whose kidnapping at knifepoint in 1993
helped raise the nation's awareness of missing children. Mershon
demanded to know the identity of Richard Allen Davis, who then was
taken quickly and quietly into custody.</LD>
<TE>   Now, Ryan and Mershon have teamed up to track down an altogether
different class of criminals: those who manipulated the energy market
during California's 2000-01 electricity crisis.</TE>
<TE>   Already, the 6-month-old investigation has secured a key guilty
plea from a former Enron Corp. executive who has promised to
cooperate with authorities. And it has produced a flurry of subpoenas
to energy companies around the country seeking data on power
generation, trading activities and the interaction between market
players.</TE>
<TE>   For Ryan and Mershon, their pursuit of electron lawbreakers is
part of a broader push to go after more white-collar criminals in
Northern California while beefing up the region's anti-terrorism
vigilance. Among their targets are those in Silicon Valley who
engaged in accounting that got a little too creative.</TE>
<TE>   In August, Mershon and Ryan started a corporate fraud tip line
([800] 207-7676) and a Web page (sanfrancisco.fbi
.gov/securitiesfraud.htm) that have produced more than 1,000 leads
and additional casework in California and other parts of the country.
The effort has been so successful, Mershon said, that FBI
headquarters in Washington is planning to take it over.</TE>
<TE>   Said San Diego plaintiffs' attorney Michael Aguirre: "The U.S.
attorney's office in San Francisco has become the epicenter of
white-collar prosecution on the West Coast."</TE>
<TE>   But it is the energy probe, above all else, that stands as Ryan
and Mershon's biggest test. The inquiry is considered the most
significant corporate crime investigation in recent state history,
and there is great pressure to bring to justice those who profited at
consumers' expense.</TE>
<TE>   So far, Ryan and Mershon seem to be relishing the moment.</TE>
<TE>   The day after Timothy Belden, chief of Enron's Western electricity
trading operation, pleaded guilty in October to conspiracy to commit
wire fraud, Ryan and Mershon held a news conference in San Francisco
to issue an extraordinary warning to others who gamed the energy
market: We're coming to get you.</TE>
<TE>   "To Mr. Belden's co-conspirators -- and they know who they are --
they should be very concerned about this investigation," Ryan said.
"We'll go after anyone and everyone who manipulated California's
energy market."</TE>
<TE>   Said Mershon, "One individual does not make a conspiracy."</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps not surprisingly, some in the industry are less than
pleased by the tenor of the investigation.</TE>
<TE>   "This continued inquisitor approach to looking backward prevents
us from moving forward," said Jan Smutny-Jones, executive director of
the Independent Energy Producers Assn., a Sacramento-based trade
group of electricity generators.</TE>
<TE>   Certain power traders contend that they operated within the
regulations -- albeit flawed ones -- established by the California
Independent System Operator and the now-defunct California Power
Exchange.</TE>
<TE>   "I feel like the U.S. attorney is rewriting" the rule book after
the fact, said Gary Ackerman, executive director of the Western Power
Trading Forum, an industry organization for electricity traders.</TE>
<TE>   When asked whether a trader could operate within the rules and yet
still commit a federal crime, Ryan and Mershon declined to comment.</TE>
<TE>   Ryan and Mershon are new to their jobs, having started in July
after the former U.S. attorney in San Francisco, Robert S. Mueller,
became FBI director, creating a vacancy that Ryan filled. Mueller, in
turn, selected San Francisco FBI chief Bruce Gebhardt as his deputy
director, opening the way for Mershon to take that post.</TE>
<TE>   Ryan, 45, is the Canadian-born son of Irish immigrants who moved
to San Francisco when he was 6 months old. After graduation from the
University of San Francisco law school, he was hired in 1984 as a
prosecutor in the Alameda County district attorney's office, where he
progressed from drunk driving cases to the prosecution of violent
criminals.</TE>
<TE>   Gov. Pete Wilson appointed Ryan, a Republican, as a judge in the
civil division of the San Francisco Municipal Court in 1996, and two
years later Ryan became a Superior Court judge.</TE>
<TE>   "He had all the right stuff right from the start," said Carol
Corrigan, a state appeals court judge who was a supervisor in the
Alameda district attorney's office. "As a judge, Kevin was very
highly regarded. He became one of the real go-to guys on the bench."</TE>
<TE>   For his part, the 51-year-old Mershon dreamed G-man dreams from
childhood. But it was his handling of finance, not firearms, that
landed him a job with the FBI.</TE>
<TE>   Knowing that the bureau favored numbers crunchers and lawyers in
its hiring, Mershon earned an accounting degree at the University of
Notre Dame and was studying for his certified public accountant
license when the FBI called.</TE>
<TE>   Mershon has spent 27 years with the FBI in New York, Washington,
Miami, San Francisco and Denver, where he was in charge of the
bureau's operations in Colorado and Wyoming.</TE>
<TE>   During his first stint in San Francisco, Mershon supervised the
FBI's investigation in the Klaas case. It was an evidence team that
Mershon created to respond to a rash of Bay Area kidnappings that
discovered the crucial piece of evidence: a palm print in Polly's
bedroom that led investigators to her murderer.</TE>
<TE>   Police had information that Richard Allen Davis was holed up in
his home on the Coyote Valley Indian Reservation near Ukiah, Calif.
The FBI was preparing a raid when Davis unexpectedly pulled up to a
nearby police checkpoint where Mershon and other officers were
standing.</TE>
<TE>   "Mark recognized him," recalled FBI spokesman Andrew Black. "He
walked right up to the vehicle." Davis surrendered.</TE>
<TE>   "That was an unusual day," Mershon said with characteristic
understatement, acknowledging that going alone to the suspect's van
with his gun still holstered strayed somewhat from standard FBI
procedure.</TE>
<TE>   In Colorado, Mershon was involved with several other high-profile
cases, including a string of mailbox pipe bombings this year. About
two years ago, he spearheaded the peaceful capture of six of seven
Texas prison inmates, whose escape and subsequent murder of a police
officer sparked a massive manhunt. The seventh inmate committed
suicide.</TE>
<TE>   "The myth of the FBI is they come in and take over the case from
local law enforcement," said John Anderson, sheriff of El Paso
County, Colo., whose department was involved in catching the
escapees. "That didn't happen with Mark. It was, 'Leave all egos at
the door.'</TE>
<TE>   "The real value of a person's character is how they walk the
talk," Anderson said. "During the 48 hours that we spent, part of it
on the side of a hill and in the cold, Mark was there during the
whole time, not grandstanding in any way, but very aware that his
people were on the front line, as were mine."</TE>
<TE>   In the course of their careers, Ryan and Mershon have been touched
by controversy.</TE>
<TE>   As an Alameda prosecutor, Ryan was accused in 1994 of unfairly
removing as potential jurors two African Americans in a murder trial
in which the defendant also was black. Ryan was cleared in 1999 by a
federal appeals court, which said he had legitimate reasons and did
not discriminate because of race.</TE>
<TE>   After the deadly April 1999 shooting spree at Columbine High
School, the FBI was accused of being slow to react. Mershon defended
his SWAT team's work, saying that the response was timely and that
the squad acted properly by first forming a corridor to protect
fleeing students and teachers before entering the school.</TE>
<TE>   The investigation of energy market manipulation in California
began in June with a referral from the Enron task force, headed by
Leslie Caldwell, who also is attached to the U.S. attorney's office
in San Francisco.</TE>
<TE>   The probe is being run day to day by Assistant U.S. Attys. Patrick
D. Robbins and Matthew J. Jacobs, with assistance from antitrust
trial attorney Lisa Tenorio-Kutzkey. The FBI team, led by B.J.
Sullivan, head of the white-collar-crime squad, has expertise in the
most complicated cases.</TE>
<TE>   "The focus of the Enron task force is primarily securities fraud.
The focus of our group is on the criminal manipulation of the
California energy market," Robbins said, carefully avoiding singling
out Enron.</TE>
<TE>   Investigators are looking at the behavior of several market
participants, which have received broad subpoenas seeking details
about how they ran their power plants, how they traded electricity,
what kinds of payments they received under California's complex
system for relieving congestion on electricity transmission lines and
what kinds of contact the companies had with others making and
trading electricity in the state.</TE>
<TE>   Ryan, Mershon and crew declined to divulge new details of the
inquiry.</TE>
<TE>   "It's fair to say that we have a very aggressive team working
here," Ryan said.</TE>
<TE>   Investigators have been talking to traders who worked for Belden,
and some evidently are trying to cut deals for themselves. Belden has
promised cooperation with various state and federal probes, which
will be taken into account when he is sentenced in April.</TE>
<TE>   California Public Utilities Commission President Loretta Lynch,
herself a lawyer, said she was happy to see a criminal investigation
of market manipulation making headway.</TE>
<TE>   Lynch and other California officials have been sharply critical of
federal regulators and politicians, saying they acted too slowly as
the state's energy crisis exploded.</TE>
<TE>   "I am really heartened that Kevin Ryan is taking this on, because
the PUC has no criminal jurisdiction," Lynch said.</TE>
<TE>   "The fact that we now have a prosecutor going after all the
troublemakers -- well, it's about time. There's nothing like getting
people in front of a grand jury."</TE>

<HD>Shoppers' Quest for Bargains Boosts Sales</HD>
<DH>The holiday season starts strong for retailers, but
analysts are not sure whether it will hold up.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Leslie Earnest</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Bombarding shoppers with bargains apparently pumped up sales for the
nation's retailers, which posted a better-than-expected start to the
holiday shopping season, analysts said Sunday.</LD>
<LD>   Yet it was far from clear whether U.S. retail sales will end up
stronger this year or fizzle as December unfolds. Some analysts worry
that with shoppers increasingly intent on snagging bargains, there's
a risk that prices will have to fall even lower to keep them
motivated.</LD>
<LD>   "Once you start, how do you stop?" said Barbara Johnson, managing
partner at ShopperTrak RCT, which released estimates of national
retail sales Sunday. "They've got to hit with bigger discounts as
they get deeper into the season.... If you start with a big discount,
where are you going to end?"</LD>
<TE>   The risk is that shoppers begin seeing the lower price as the
norm, Johnson said, a phenomenon that's already occurring, especially
among apparel and electronics retailers.</TE>
<TE>   "I think right now they're doing whatever they can to get the
consumer to buy," she said.</TE>
<TE>   It evidently worked over the weekend.</TE>
<TE>   Sales jumped 12.3% on Friday and 9% on Saturday compared with
2001, according to ShopperTrak's estimates, which are derived from
Commerce Department sales data. Overall, estimated sales for the two
days were $12.6 billion, up 11% from last year.</TE>
<TE>   A separate survey of 7,000 people by the National Retail
Federation, the nation's top retail trade group, found that 75% of
U.S. consumers went shopping over the weekend, spurred on by a
relatively short span between Thanksgiving and Christmas this year
and heavy promotions of on-sale merchandise.</TE>
<TE>   "What we're seeing is basically a strong start, one that I think
really does increase the confidence level that we can do relatively
well this holiday season," said economist Michael Niemira.</TE>
<TE>   But retailers could have "pulled forward some sales that might
have come over the next week or two or three," he added. "That's the
worry."</TE>
<TE>   The shopping season between Thanksgiving and Christmas typically
accounts for about one-quarter of U.S. retailers' sales.</TE>
<TE>   Discount retailers, which used sharp markdowns on items such as
27-inch televisions, diamond jewelry and Barbie dolls to lure
shoppers Friday, clearly were the early winners.</TE>
<TE>   Bentonville, Ark.-based Wal-Mart Stores Inc., the world's largest
retailer, said its sales hit a one-day record of $1.43 billion on
Friday, a 14% jump over the day after Thanksgiving last year.</TE>
<TE>   The shopping frenzy had visibly calmed by Sunday morning at
Glendale Galleria, where there was no wait to see Santa. He and his
elves looked bored at the North Pole outpost until a family with
three small children showed up -- and received lavish attention.</TE>
<TE>   An hour after the mall's doors opened, it was still easy to get a
parking spot in less than a minute, and numerous gift stores, such as
Games Workshop, Sanrio Surprises and the Game Keeper, were so quiet
that employees passed the time in conversation.</TE>
<TE>   Major toy retailer KB Toys and the Disney Store each had a dozen
customers, but lines at the registers moved quickly.</TE>
<TE>   By 11 a.m., the activity had picked up, but it still was laid back
compared with the mob scene Friday.</TE>
<TE>   Retail experts had expected a particularly frantic dash to stores
at the start of this holiday season because it includes only four
weekends instead of five. They surmised that shoppers would panic
about the dwindling days until Christmas.</TE>
<TE>   But shoppers are making headway, according to the retail trade
group's survey, which showed that the average consumer had completed
almost 40% of holiday shopping by Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, the day after Thanksgiving was the sixth-busiest
sales-generating day of the season. The weekend accounted for 8.4% of
holiday sales, according to the International Council of Shopping
Centers.</TE>
<TE>   For all of November and December, the National Retail Federation
has predicted that holiday sales will rise 4% this year over last,
which would mark the smallest increase in five years.</TE>
<TE>   Comparisons with last year are difficult to evaluate because some
retail experts believe that shoppers in the earlier period still were
stunned by the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.</TE>
<TE>   On the day after Thanksgiving last year, sales nudged up just
2.7%, compared with an 11.1% increase in 2000. But consumers then
picked up the pace last December as desperate retailers slashed
prices.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, 2001 boasted the warmest November in 108 years,
according to Michael Baker, an economist with the International
Council of Shopping Centers. That meant consumers shunned
cold-weather clothes that help fuel sales.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of apparel retailers were wringing their hands this time
last year," Baker said. "This year, we're hoping apparel is going to
move a lot better."</TE>
<TE>   Baker noted that disposable income is up about 3.9% compared with
2001 and that a wave of mortgage refinancing has allowed people to
turn home equity into cash or at least reduce their mortgage
payments.</TE>
<TE>   "We know there are resources out there for consumers to draw on in
terms of spending power," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Nonetheless, Baker did not boost his November-to-December sales
projections, even after Friday's onslaught of shoppers.</TE>
<TE>   That's because consumers are still grappling with so much
uncertainty, what with a lack of employment growth, terrorism
concerns and the possibility that a war could pull the nation back
into recession.</TE>
<TE>   "There are all sorts of things on people's minds at the moment,"
Baker said. "Most likely, they are going to curb spending."</TE>

<DL>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa</DL>
<LD>Millions of people around the globe marked World AIDS Day on Sunday
with marches and prayers amid grim statistics that show the epidemic
outpacing efforts to control it.</LD>
<LD>   In China, officials instructed 1 million students to launch a
national AIDS awareness campaign. In Britain, health experts warned
of a startling jump in new infections. And in South Africa -- the
country worst hit by the disease -- activists held a mass funeral for
babies.</LD>
<LD>   "We pay tribute to all the children who have passed away in our
care," said Jackie Schoeman of the Cotlands Baby Sanctuary, which
held a ceremony in Johannesburg to inter the victims' ashes.</LD>
<TE>   Sunday's activities highlighted how the disease has spread since
it was detected in gay men in the U.S. in 1981.</TE>
<TE>   Estimates released by the U.N. last week indicate that more than
40 million people worldwide are infected.</TE>

<LD>Two Turkish inmates who had refused solid food for months died over
the weekend, the state-run Anatolian news agency reported, the latest
deaths in a hunger strike that has claimed at least 60 lives.</LD>
<LD>   Hundreds of leftist prisoners launched the strike in 2000 in an
attempt to force the government to abandon plans to transfer inmates
from old dormitory wards to cell-based jails, which they say put
prisoners at greater risk of torture. The government argues the new
jails are in line with European standards.</LD>

<LD>A U.S. B-52 dropped seven 2,000-pound bombs close to the scene of
fighting between rival Afghan factions, the first time the giant
warplanes have been used in Afghanistan for months.</LD>
<LD>   Col. Roger King said the B-52 was called in to protect U.S.
Special Forces who clashed with armed Afghans outside a U.S. base in
western Afghanistan.</LD>
<LD>   Afghan commanders, however, said the bombs fell near the scene of
fierce fighting between Afghan troops from two rival factions near
the Shindand air base. At least 11 Afghans were killed in factional
fighting, U.S. and local officials said.</LD>

<HD>Kenyan Farmer 'Burned' by Touch of Suspected Bombers</HD>
<DH>'I shook hands with fire,' says the man, who spoke briefly
to strangers parked in front of his home shortly before blast.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Davan Maharaj and Alissa J. Rubin</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL>MSUMARINI, Kenya</DL>
<LD>As Kenyan and Israeli investigators squabbled Sunday over critical
evidence found at the scene of a terrorist strike here, a subsistence
farmer described how he shook hands with suicide bombers mere minutes
before they attacked a packed seaside resort, killing 13 people plus
themselves.</LD>
<LD>   "These are not good people. I shook hands with fire," said Khamis
Haro Deche, 39, describing two men who had parked their sport utility
vehicle in front of his mud hut Thursday morning. "When you shake
hands with fire, you will get burned. My heart is burned because they
have done something very serious."</LD>
<LD>   Deche may have been the last to come face-to-face with bombers who
brought terror to this quiet village on the shores of the Indian
Ocean. Israel said Sunday that the bombing at the Paradise hotel,
along with the near-simultaneous firing of two missiles at an Israeli
airliner leaving nearby Mombasa, appeared to be the work of Osama bin
Laden's Al Qaeda network, not Palestinian groups.</LD>
<TE>   Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon has ordered his Mossad spy
agency to hunt down and punish planners of the attacks. But Sunday,
Mossad agents and Kenyan police fought over vital pieces of evidence.</TE>
<TE>   Kenyan investigators said they would prevent Israeli bomb experts,
who continued to sift through the ruins of the resort Sunday, from
taking to Israel parts of the Mitsubishi Pajero used in the bomb
attack as well as rocket launchers and missile casings found near the
Mombasa airport.</TE>
<TE>   "None of this evidence is going back to Israel. This evidence is
our responsibility," said Charles Jamu, a Kenyan bomb specialist.</TE>
<TE>   Mossad agents were becoming increasingly dissatisfied with the way
local investigators were handling the probe. Scores of looky-loos
have traipsed through the site of the bombing, and sensitive evidence
has been paraded before the media.</TE>
<TE>   "They're no use except to smile at you," an Israeli security
official at the site said of Kenyan investigators.</TE>
<TE>   Ranaan Gissin, a spokesman for Sharon, was more sympathetic.</TE>
<TE>   "Look, it's a Third World country. The norms are different, the
bureaucracy is different," he told reporters in Israel. "They are
very nice, they are trying to do the best they can. But it's not up
to the standards" of the developed world.</TE>
<TE>   Kenyan Internal Security Minister Julius Sunkuli defended local
investigators over the weekend, saying they had the knowledge and
skills to handle a terror case.</TE>
<TE>   Israeli and Kenyan officials did apparently cooperate in the
interview of Deche. The farmer said he was awakened about 8 a.m.
Thursday by his 13-year-old daughter, who told him a strange vehicle
was parked in their yard. Deche went out to greet the men and ask how
they were doing.</TE>
<TE>   "We are fine," a slim passenger in the front seat said in
Arabic-accented Swahili, according to Deche. The farmer said that
when he offered a handshake, the men appeared nervous. He said he
also thought it was strange that several mobile phones lined the
dashboard of their vehicle.</TE>
<TE>   According to Deche, the men assured him that they were simply
waiting for a friend. The farmer memorized the vehicle's license
plate number and returned to his two-room hut made of mud and palm
branches.</TE>
<TE>   Minutes later, the explosives-laden Pajero was driven into the
Paradise hotel. Kenyan police said three suicide bombers were killed,
along with 10 Kenyans and three Israeli tourists. Deche said the
blast rocked his hut, causing him, his wife and their five children
to hit the dirt floor.</TE>
<TE>   Deche said he was interrogated at his home Friday by four Kenyan
police officers, who returned the next day with some "white men"
believed to be Mossad agents. On Sunday night, Deche returned home
from visiting a sick brother to find a dozen reporters camped in
front of his house.</TE>
<TE>   Deche lamented that he did not have a phone. "If I had [one], I
would have called" the police, he said.</TE>
<TE>   The blast, he said, pushed his family further into poverty. His
young daughters will no longer be able to earn money by collecting
firewood for the Paradise hotel.</TE>
<TE>   On Sunday, Israeli Defense Minister Shaul Mofaz for the first time
said the evidence pointed to Al Qaeda. "We have reason to believe
that Al Qaeda was connected to [the attacks in Kenya]," Mofaz said.
"The terrorists' intention was to cause a far greater disaster, and
from now on we should make every effort to strike also those
terrorist organizations which share neither territorial nor moral
borders with us."</TE>
<TE>   In the aftermath of the attacks, questions have arisen in London
about possible hints during past weeks that Israelis in East Africa
would be targeted.</TE>
<TE>   Sheik Omar Bakri Mohammed, a well-known Islamic activist in
London, says he ran across a possible threatening prediction on the
Internet eight days before the attacks in Kenya.</TE>
<TE>   The warning came in the form of a letter in Arabic reached via an
Internet chat room that is popular with Muslim activists, Bakri said
in an interview Sunday. The anonymous author predicted "good news for
all Muslims" and warned that Israel would pay a price for what the
author called its mistreatment of Palestinians, according to Bakri,
who heads the aggressively fundamentalist Al Muhajiroun movement.</TE>
<TE>   The letter's most premonitory statement, according to Bakri: "You
are going to hear good news about Israelis in East Africa."</TE>
<TE>   "Maybe it was someone who was bluffing, maybe it was someone who
was serious," Bakri said. "They did not mention Kenya specifically.
But the writing indicated that the person who wrote it was a mature
person. It quoted verses of the Koran. It didn't seem like someone
fooling around."</TE>
<TE>   Bakri said that he has tried to reconnect with the letter since
the attacks, but that the link provided by the author is no longer
accessible.</TE>

<HD>For Some Kuwaitis, Savior Is Now Enemy</HD>
<DH>Anti-Western extremism in the Gulf nation that a U.S.-led
coalition liberated a decade ago is confirmed by attacks on American
troops.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>John Daniszewski</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>KUWAIT CITY</DL>
<LD>The glass-and-steel shopping mall glitters at night. Inside, luxury
boutiques offer gold and jewels, Mont Blanc pens and Lacoste
sportswear. At the designer coffee shop on the ground floor, patrons
sip espressos and lattes around a baby grand piano that revolves
beneath laser lights.</LD>
<LD>   This seems a strangely Vegas-like venue for a meeting with a
leading member of the country's burgeoning Islamist movement.</LD>
<LD>   But that's Kuwait, where the baubles and luxuries of the West
abound thanks to the oil bonanza, yet the most potent political force
calls for a return to fundamental Muslim values and tribal heritage.</LD>
<TE>   Clearly, even Kuwaitis -- who arguably should be America's best
friends in the Arab world, given that their country owes its
continued existence to a U.S.-led rescue 11 years ago -- have a
love-hate relationship with the West.</TE>
<TE>   So much so that traffic patrolman Khaled Shimmiri, who stopped two
American soldiers on a highway last month for allegedly speeding,
drew his pistol without warning and shot both. In October, a pair of
extremists ambushed U.S. Marines on training exercises, killing one
before other Marines killed them.</TE>
<TE>   After the highway incident, the Kuwaiti government put out word
that the officer -- who was arrested in Saudi Arabia -- was mentally
unbalanced. U.S. officials, meanwhile, assured journalists that this
nation remains firmly in the pro-American camp.</TE>
<TE>   But Kuwaitis and longtime expatriates here say they have seen a
steady and disturbing rise in Islamic extremism.</TE>
<TE>   "I have been here 22 years, and in that time I have seen the
country becoming more and more fundamentalist," said a European
businessman, who asked that his name not be used. "This country is
going backward, not forward." As for any residual gratitude toward
the U.S., he scoffed: "Eaten bread is soon forgotten."</TE>
<TE>   The attacks on the Americans have raised alarms about the
reliability of Kuwait, which could be the jumping-off point of any
U.S.-led invasion to oust Iraqi President Saddam Hussein.</TE>
<TE>   The government here already has restricted its citizens' access to
one-fourth of the country where U.S. exercises are taking place. The
move does not appear to have caused much resentment among Kuwaitis,
but it was at least a blunt acknowledgment that some of them might
pose a threat to the more than 12,000 U.S. troops on the ground.</TE>
<TE>   Like Arabs elsewhere, Kuwaitis say there is a widespread sense of
rage and humiliation among ordinary people caused by the actions of
Israel against the Palestinians and a sense that the U.S. campaign
against terrorism is a thinly disguised religious war against
Muslims.</TE>
<TE>   "Every day we watch on TV the scenes of Israel killing people in
Palestine. Every day. What do you expect to happen in the Arab
person's mind? You should expect huge anger, and sometimes it does
not stay only as anger. It develops into action," said Ismail Shatti,
the Islamist meeting a journalist at the Galleria 2000 mall.</TE>
<TE>   Shatti runs a consulting business from a luxurious wood-paneled
office and wears a close-trimmed goatee rather than the long wild
growth favored by the fundamentalists. He deems himself a moderate
and supports the U.S. presence in Kuwait as a protector from the
Hussein regime. If there is an invasion of Iraq, he will back the
United States as a way of repaying the Americans for their role as
Kuwait's savior -- even though he would be opposed to the invasion,
he said.</TE>
<TE>   But any society has extremists and fanatics, said Shatti, who
believes that other Kuwaitis might want to follow in the footsteps of
those who have already taken up arms against their American guests.</TE>
<TE>   "Any society consists of some fragile people, and pressure will
guide them to lunacy and fanatic actions," he said.</TE>
<TE>   So far there has been one U.S. victim in Kuwait: the Marine killed
Oct. 8 by two men investigators have linked to Al Qaeda. The
attackers' funeral drew a large crowd of supporters and a mullah --
later arrested -- who lionized them as martyrs.</TE>
<TE>   Although the heavily armed U.S. presence in the country is able to
take care of itself, it is an awkward reality that as forces are
built up in the region for a possible invasion, they must be wary of
the very people they originally came to help.</TE>
<TE>   Some in Kuwait, especially the U.S.-educated elite, believe that
Western-style liberal democracy is the answer to the problems here
and in the rest of the Arab world. But the liberals admit that they
lack the financial support, mass appeal and organization of the
Islamists, though the Sept. 11 attacks spurred them to press for
democratic reforms and to oppose religious intolerance.</TE>
<TE>   The limited democracy that the U.S. helped foster here after the
ouster of Iraqi troops in 1991 gave Islamists their foothold on power
here, said Shamlan Essa, chairman of political science at Kuwait
University.</TE>
<TE>   "This is the problem with democracy -- it allows Islamic
fundamentalists to pop up like mushrooms," he said.</TE>
<TE>   In the Kuwaiti parliament, 15 to 20 of the 50 members are
Islamists and about 10 are liberals. The balance is held by "tribal"
independents. In reality, however, the conservative tribal
representatives tend to side with the Islamic bloc.</TE>
<TE>   As a result, Islamic issues dominate public debate. Religious
groups recently pushed through a law mandating segregation of the
sexes on Kuwait University's modern, sprawling campus, and there have
been calls for more hours of religious training each week in public
schools.</TE>
<TE>   One foreign resident said he did not think the Islamic factor
would deter Kuwaitis from applauding an invasion to oust Hussein.
Kuwaitis are like "kids in a candy store" when it comes to removing
the Iraqi leader, the observer said.</TE>
<TE>   Both Kuwaiti officials and Western experts consider the number of
hard-core Al Qaeda operatives in the country to be small -- in the
dozens rather than the hundreds. And the estimated 70 to 120 Kuwaitis
who went to Afghanistan to fight with Al Qaeda reportedly are under
close scrutiny by intelligence agencies. The October attack on the
Marines at Faylakah island did not have the earmarks of a carefully
planned operation.</TE>
<TE>   The consensus of Kuwaiti and U.S. officials is that there could be
small-scale attacks that take advantage of targets of opportunity in
Kuwait, but that Al Qaeda would not be capable of large-scale actions
against Americans here.</TE>
<TE>   How could such hostility develop in a country where Americans were
joyously embraced as liberators only a few years ago?</TE>
<TE>   Shatti, a senior member of the Islamic Constitutional Movement,
said Islamists like him have had almost no political competition
since the death of the Arab nationalist movement in the 1960s and
'70s and the near-eradication of communism and socialism after the
Cold War. Now the only alternative to Islamists is "liberal democracy
-- the West," he said. "And people do not like how the West has been
treating us."</TE>
<TE>   Essa, the university department chairman, blames the Kuwaiti royal
family, which runs the government, for giving the Islamist movement
too much scope. Part of the reason, he suggested, is that the royals
felt "guilty" for not having prevented the invasion by Iraq in August
1990 and were afraid to try to challenge the Islamists openly.</TE>
<TE>   Although the Al Sabah dynasty has led the emirate for more than
200 years, its authority is not absolute -- it has suffered from
infighting among different branches of the family as well as frequent
conflicts with parliament.</TE>
<TE>   "The whole quandary in the Gulf is that the governments and the
Islamic fundamentalists both compete for the popular masses, and
their competition inevitably revolves around Islam," Essa said.</TE>
<TE>   The result is that the government surrenders to the religious
groups, he said. For instance, he said, they have been allowed to set
up their own "finance house" that is a largely unregulated bank
outside the banking system. Islamic groups also have about 120
charities in Kuwait, and "no one knows where the money goes," though
U.S. officials have requested closer auditing of the groups.</TE>
<TE>   In contrast, Essa contended, when liberals tried to set up their
own organization -- a Kuwaiti Committee for Human Rights -- the
government turned them down.</TE>
<TE>   Islamists control the Education Ministry in Kuwait and neighboring
Saudi Arabia, Essa said, and are shaping the thinking of the next
generation in the worst ways. Instruction is "full of messages of
hate toward the West and Christians and Jews," he said. Liberals
"have been telling them for the last 20 years that this is not right,
not right."</TE>
<TE>   "I never thought it would reach this point," said Mohammed Jassem,
another liberal, who is editor of the Al Watan newspaper and the
Arabic edition of Newsweek magazine. He also sees government timidity
as the main reason for the rise in anti-Americanism and
fundamentalism.</TE>
<TE>   "What we need is a very strong signal by the government to say
that the government is working with the Americans and to show that
this is in Kuwait's interest. We should not be shy about saying it,"
Jassem said. "And the Americans should push the Arabs to be clear
about supporting them."</TE>
<TE>   Jassem said liberals are outmatched by the Islamists. "Liberals
here could not achieve a demonstration of 200 people, but the
Islamist groups could get thousands out on the street if they
wanted.... We cannot stop them, we just have to contain them."</TE>
<TE>   Waleed Nusif, editor of Al Qabas newspaper, said there is even a
cult-like tendency to try to seduce children into the Islamists'
fold. "They are targeting the ages between 5 and 10" with offers of
games and camping trips heavily dosed with religious teachings.</TE>
<TE>   Shafeeq Ghabra, director of the Center for Strategic and Future
Studies, believes that the few liberals need to be willing to stand
up and challenge the extremists or else the Arab world is going to
find itself falling further and further behind.</TE>
<TE>   On a recent evening, addressing a group of expatriate business
executives whose questions reflected a deep anxiety about recent
happenings, Ghabra was blunt: "The school and the mosque were totally
ignored over the last two decades. The state gave up its
responsibility in the field of education. Everything -- social
science, literature -- became religious," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "And what is the result? It produces a guy who can go into
Faylakah and shoot an American and think that he is serving his
country."</TE>

<HD>2 Die in Gaza During Israeli Incursion</HD>
<DH>Troops killed one man, Palestinians say. Another is found
dead under rubble of homes.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>JERUSALEM</DL>
<LD>Israeli troops shot dead one Palestinian man, and another died under
the rubble of one of three homes soldiers demolished in a predawn
operation in the Gaza Strip, Palestinians said Sunday.</LD>
<LD>   About 30 Israeli tanks rolled into Beit Lahiya late Saturday.
Palestinian witnesses reported fierce exchanges of gunfire between
Palestinians and Israeli troops during the three-hour incursion. They
said the dead man was a bystander watching events from his home's
balcony. The army said soldiers fired at and hit armed Palestinians.</LD>
<LD>   Early Sunday, hours after the army withdrew, Palestinians found
the body of Ashour Dab, 70, under the rubble of one of the three
homes the army demolished, Palestinian witnesses and emergency
officials said. They said he did not have time to flee before the
demolition.</LD>
<TE>   An army spokesman, Capt. Jacob Dallal, said soldiers routinely
perform "a lengthy procedure" to make sure homes are vacant.</TE>
<TE>   "The soldiers call on loudspeakers for people to leave, the
building is thoroughly searched, and then there is a final call," he
said. "This whole procedure takes ... two to three hours."</TE>
<TE>   Among the homes destroyed was that of Hisham Dab, an Islamic Jihad
suicide bomber who killed 20 Israelis in a 1996 attack in Tel Aviv,
the army said. It did not say why it struck the house six years after
the attack.</TE>
<TE>   Later Sunday, an Israeli helicopter fired two missiles at a car
carrying three members of Islamic Jihad between Beit Lahiya and the
Jabaliya refugee camp, injuring one of them and three bystanders,
security sources said. Witnesses said the car's occupants leaped out
of the vehicle just before the missiles struck.</TE>
<TE>   "Suddenly I saw a Mercedes driving fast down the road and it was
hit by flames coming from the sky," said Amina Daalasa, 55, who lives
nearby.</TE>
<TE>   During more than two years of Palestinian-Israeli violence, Israel
has killed dozens of suspected militants in what it calls "targeted
attacks," saying that it is preventing terror strikes.</TE>
<TE>   Palestinians charge that the practice amounts to assassination of
their leaders, and human rights groups call such attacks summary
executions without judicial process.</TE>

<HD>Trove of Russian Arms at Risk</HD>
<DH>Stockpiles of outdated nuclear and chemical weapons may be
within reach of terrorists. The U.S. effort to help destroy them is
bogged down in Congress.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Sonni Efron</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Eleven years after the United States committed to helping the former
Soviet Union secure and destroy its weapons of mass destruction, and
14 months after President Bush made it a priority to keep them out of
terrorists' hands, vast and lethal stockpiles remain ripe for
plucking, officials and nonproliferation experts say.</LD>
<LD>   Although Bush and other world leaders have become ardent about the
need to secure stockpiles and crack down on proliferators,
implementation is snarled in bureaucratic and political wrangling in
the U.S., Russia, Europe and Japan, arms control experts say.</LD>
<LD>   As a result, even while the U.S. talks about a dangerous new arms
race -- between terrorists determined to get weapons of mass
destruction and governments desperate to stop them -- progress on
taking deadly material out of circulation is slow and sometimes
stymied.</LD>
<TE>   And the proliferation threat, U.S. officials say, is getting
worse, not better. Potential buyers are believed to include Iraqi
President Saddam Hussein and Osama bin Laden, who has said it is the
duty of Muslims to acquire nuclear weapons.</TE>
<TE>   Last week's terrorist attacks in Kenya underscore the
proliferation threat from Soviet-made weapons. The shoulder-fired
missile that just missed an Israeli passenger jet appears to have
been Soviet-made, and Al Qaeda is believed to have fired several more
surface-to-air missiles at American targets in Afghanistan and the
Middle East in the last several years.</TE>
<TE>   If U.S. lawmakers of both major parties are frustrated by the
delays in securing or destroying the former Soviet Union's arsenals,
arms control advocates are apoplectic. Former Soviet President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev came to Washington this spring to urge Bush and
National Security Advisor Condoleezza Rice to move faster, before
disaster strikes. Even billionaire investor Warren Buffett has
weighed in, paying millions to do what the U.S. government cannot.</TE>
<TE>   A small number of conservative House members and Pentagon
hard-liners who are suspicious of Russian intentions have put key
nonproliferation programs in handcuffs.</TE>
<TE>   The issue has caused divisions among Republicans in Congress.
During recent Senate hearings, the gentlemanly Sen. Richard G. Lugar
(R-Ind.), in a rare breach of protocol, began to name names. He
blamed California Rep. Duncan Hunter of Alpine and Rep. Curt Weldon
of Pennsylvania for blocking funding of anti-proliferation programs.</TE>
<TE>   Hunter did not return repeated telephone calls to his office.
Weldon, in a telephone interview, insisted that he supports
nonproliferation programs and would be willing to spend more if the
money did not come out of the U.S. defense budget.</TE>
<TE>   But sources say that behind closed doors, Weldon, Hunter and other
conservatives on the House Armed Services Committee have for years
sabotaged the programs by attaching numerous conditions that are all
but impossible for the Russians to fulfill.</TE>
<TE>   Opponents say every dollar given to the Russians to destroy
obsolete weapons is a dollar freed up for them to use for other
military spending. They also have raised concerns that disarmament
funds are used to solve environmental problems that are not security
threats.</TE>
<TE>   Arms control experts and congressional sources say that in the
waning days of the 107th Congress, Hunter and his allies hobbled a
program to build a plant in Shchuchye in southern Russia to destroy
about 45,000 tons of nerve gas stored in decaying canisters that are
poorly guarded and small enough to be stashed in a briefcase.</TE>
<TE>   And they killed a budget item that would have allowed the Bush
administration to use up to $50 million of nonproliferation funds to
secure nuclear materials outside the former Soviet Union, which is
not permitted under existing U.S. law. The idea was to help nations
such as Pakistan and Yugoslavia safeguard or destroy old nuclear
reactor fuel or other weapons materiel that could be blown up, stolen
by terrorists, or smuggled out by corrupt insiders and sold on the
international black market.</TE>
<TE>   "Today, there is Russian-origin weapons-grade usable uranium
sitting in North Korea, supplied by the Soviet Union," said Jon
Wolfsthal, a former Energy Department nonproliferation expert now at
the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. "If Kim Jong Il
himself called up President Bush and said, 'Here, come take it,'
there would be no money available under U.S. law to come and get it."</TE>
<TE>   "We can bomb it, but we can't acquire it," said Andrew Fisher,
spokesman for Lugar.</TE>
<TE>   Lugar, who with former Sen. Sam Nunn (D-Ga.) spearheaded the
program to dismantle Soviet weapons programs more than a decade ago,
will be taking over from Sen. Joseph R. Biden Jr. (D-Del.) as
chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee in January. Lugar
has said protecting America from weapons of mass destruction will be
his top priority.</TE>
<TE>   Polls indicate the American public feels that the spread of
nuclear weapons is the most serious global problem.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. has already committed $10 billion for the job of
eliminating the weapons. And in June, the other seven industrialized
nations of the Group of 8 jointly pledged another $10 billion over
the next 10 years. In the last 11 years, the U.S. has spent $7
billion and the other nations have spent a total of $1 billion, John
R. Bolton, undersecretary of State for nonproliferation, told Biden's
committee in October. Details of how the G-8 money will be spent are
still being worked out.</TE>
<TE>   At the October hearing, Lugar and Biden were bursting with
bipartisan frustration. Biden wondered aloud why some of the
lawmakers willing to give Bush the maximum leeway in using military
force to wipe out Iraq's suspected weapons of mass destruction were
unwilling to spend far less on peaceful cooperation with the Russians
to make sure their treasure trove of weapons cannot be stolen or sold
to Iraq or terrorists.</TE>
<TE>   Lugar fumed to Bolton about the inability to get money freed up to
start construction of a plant to destroy the nerve gas in Shchuchye,
where the U.S. has already spent $250 million.</TE>
<TE>   Lugar noted that he had taken pictures of some of the 1.9 million
shells stored there, which are easily portable, filled with sarin and
VX nerve gas, and each capable of killing about 85,000 people if set
off in a stadium.</TE>
<TE>   In a public acknowledgment of the divisions among Republicans,
Lugar pleaded with Bolton, known as a conservative, to prod the White
House to lobby the Republican opponents.</TE>
<TE>   "The president was under the impression, when Sen. Biden and I met
with him in July, that things are on track," Lugar said. "But they
are not on track."</TE>
<TE>   A senior Bush administration official, speaking on the condition
of anonymity, would not say whether the White House had lobbied
conservatives on the issue. The official noted only that the
president's support was well known.</TE>
<TE>   In the end, Congress funded Shchuchye for one year. That means
that construction can begin, but the money will run out next
September, when the project will have to run the political gantlet
for funding again.</TE>
<TE>   Weldon insisted that he broke the logjam by persuading other House
members to accept the compromise so that the plant could go ahead.</TE>
<TE>   The 1991 Nunn-Lugar legislation first authorized the use of
American money to dismantle Soviet nuclear warheads. In the last 11
years, the legislation has morphed into a host of complex
"threat-reduction programs" run by the departments of Energy, State
and Defense.</TE>
<TE>   The joint U.S.-Russian Cooperative Threat Reduction, or CTR,
program boasts real accomplishments, including the destruction of
6,000 nuclear warheads, 400 missile silos and 1,400 missiles; the
elimination of weapons-grade uranium; the securing of nuclear
materials; and the reemployment of former Soviet nuclear, chemical
and biological weapons scientists.</TE>
<TE>   In May, Bush and Russian President Vladimir V. Putin agreed that
their countries should do everything possible to prevent
proliferation. But in practice, Russian secrecy, U.S. congressional
restrictions and the ideological hangover from the Cold War continue
to cause problems.</TE>
<TE>   Some mid-level Russian bureaucrats continue to thwart Putin's
agenda, U.S. officials and arms control experts say. Bolton noted,
for example, that the Japanese have approved money to dismantle old
Russian nuclear submarines, but that Russian officials have blocked
access to the shipyards where the subs would be taken apart. As a
result, the project has been stalled for years.</TE>
<TE>   "No one in Russia ever got fired for saying, 'No,' " said Laura
Holgate, vice president of the Nuclear Threat Initiative, a private
nonproliferation group founded by Nunn and funded by entertainment
mogul Ted Turner and a $2.5-million contribution from Buffett.</TE>
<TE>   Thus major new problems have developed in the last decade,
concludes a report released last month by a group of top U.S.,
Russian and European nonproliferation specialists.</TE>
<TE>   "Roughly half of the nuclear weapons-grade material in Russia
remains inadequately secure, the destruction of chemical weapons is
just starting and much remains unknown about past biological weapons
activities," concludes the report by the Russian American Nuclear
Security Advisory Council and the Carnegie Endowment. "Truly robust
political support for threat reduction is very rarely demonstrated
and often is more rhetorical than real."</TE>
<TE>   The Shchuchye project, seen in Russia and the U.S. as an important
test for chemical weapons disposal programs, has become a case in
point.</TE>
<TE>   The weapons storage site remains a "potential Wal-Mart for
terrorists," said Paul F. Walker, a former congressional staffer now
working for Global Green USA, the American arm of an environmental
and disarmament group founded by Gorbachev.</TE>
<TE>   Walker first visited the 80 ramshackle buildings at Shchuchye in
1994 and found them so poorly guarded that "a Boy Scout troop could
have walked in any time [to steal the weapons]. And the worst of it
was, no one would have ever known."</TE>
<TE>   "That was eight years ago," Walker noted. "It is astounding to me
that we have spun our wheels for eight years."</TE>
<TE>   Though security has since been somewhat improved at U.S. taxpayer
expense, Walker said, Shchuchye is in a remote, wooded area near the
border of Kazakhstan, near Central Asia, and is what arms control
experts call "highly proliferation prone."</TE>
<TE>   In addition to the 85-millimeter nerve gas shells, the Shchuchye
site holds 800 chemical-filled warheads for Scud missiles, some with
cluster bomb-style dispersion mechanisms that would cause maximum
casualties to civilians, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a perfect target for Al Qaeda," Walker said.</TE>
<TE>   Russian news agencies have reported arrests of attempted
infiltrators, but no details have been released, Walker added. If
there has been pilferage from the site, no one may ever know, because
no pre-1994 inventory has been found of the 45,000 or so tons of
chemical weapons stored there.</TE>
<TE>   The senior administration official brushed off criticism about the
delays, saying the disarmament programs are complex and thorny but
are moving forward. The official would not discuss whether Bush,
fresh from his midterm election triumph, will use his political
muscle to push his arms control agenda, or risk irking his
conservative base by sweetening rewards for Russia's compliance.</TE>
<TE>   But if Bush's stated goal of securing weapons of mass destruction
is to be realized, more leadership, more bureaucratic muscle and more
incentives for the countries holding the arsenals will be required,
said Holgate.</TE>
<TE>   Some Americans will balk at using tax dollars to help sometimes
unsavory or secretive governments get rid of hideous weapons or
nuclear reactor waste that they should dispose of themselves.</TE>
<TE>   But to use that as justification for inaction is to indulge an
idealism America can no longer afford, Holgate argued.</TE>
<TE>   "That's a very lovely moral high ground from which we may get
nuked," she said.</TE>

<HD>Foes of Chavez Plan Strike as Talks Progress</HD>
<DH>Venezuelan opposition hopes to topple the president, who
calls the protest illegal. Both sides have agreed to study early
elections.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>T. Christian Miller</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>CARACAS, Venezuela</DL>
<LD>As Venezuelans braced for yet another nationwide strike today, the
country remained deeply divided.</LD>
<LD>   Grim-faced opposition leaders refused to say how long the protest
would go on but made clear they hoped it would lead to the
resignation of controversial President Hugo Chavez.</LD>
<LD>   Chavez dismissed the planned protest, the fourth in a year,
calling it an illegal attack on the government.</LD>
<TE>   "They are calling a strike that is going to fail, more so than the
others," Chavez said Sunday on his weekly television broadcast. "It's
going to be a roaring failure."</TE>
<TE>   There were signs of hope, however, at the negotiating table where
Chavez's representatives and opposition leaders have been talking
since last month. The two sides have quietly agreed to study early
presidential elections as a solution to the country's worsening
crisis, according to a source close to the talks.</TE>
<TE>   The possibility of an election before the polemical president's
term ends in 2007 represents a breakthrough in the talks, which have
so far produced few results.</TE>
<TE>   "The theme of early elections is on the agenda. It hasn't been
discussed, but it's there. And that's a big change," said a source
close to the negotiations.</TE>
<TE>   But the development was not enough to stop opposition leaders from
going ahead with today's general strike, leading to fears that
violent clashes during the protest may delay -- or even derail --
further talks.</TE>
<TE>   A strike in April led to a coup against Chavez and street violence
that left about 60 dead. Chavez was restored to power 48 hours later
by loyal military units and supporters.</TE>
<TE>   Cesar Gaviria, secretary-general of the Organization of American
States and a mediator at the negotiations, said last week that a
strike would be counterproductive. The talks are also backed by the
United Nations and the Atlanta-based Carter Center.</TE>
<TE>   Nevertheless, in an interview Sunday, Gaviria maintained hope that
talks would continue after the protest, saying both sides have shown
a commitment to finding a peaceful way to bridge the country's
divisions.</TE>
<TE>   "At first, there was a lot of skepticism, but the skepticism has
gone down significantly," said Gaviria, whose effort to bring the two
sides together has been gathering force in recent weeks, receiving
the backing of Washington and other Latin American governments.
"There is now support on both sides."</TE>
<TE>   Venezuela is suffering from its worst political crisis in decades.
After his election in 1998, Chavez launched an ill-defined
"Bolivarian revolution" to help those who live in poverty -- 80% of
the country's population of 24 million.</TE>
<TE>   He enacted new laws to redistribute land and provide for greater
state control of the nation's petroleum industry, which is the
third-largest supplier of oil to the U.S. In hours-long television
broadcasts, he unleashed a rhetorical war against the country's rich
and powerful, calling them "squalid" and "rancid."</TE>
<TE>   The reforms have failed to deliver a better life for the poor. The
country's economy has shrunk by 6% this year, inflation has soared to
30%, and joblessness lies at 17%.</TE>
<TE>   Chavez's actions have given rise to a widespread, if unfocused,
opposition. Union leaders, businesses, the media, the church and many
in the military have risen to protest his actions.</TE>
<TE>   The discontent came to a head in April, when dissident military
officers and opposition leaders mounted the failed coup. Since then,
both Chavez supporters and opponents have clashed in street protests
that have erupted in violence.</TE>
<TE>   The most recent crisis came last month, when Chavez ordered the
National Guard to take over Caracas' police force, which falls under
the control of Mayor Alfredo Pena, a Chavez foe. Chavez said the move
was necessary for public order after two people were killed and 20
injured in a confrontation between Chavez supporters and police.</TE>
<TE>   Then, the Supreme Court last week quashed a move by the opposition
to hold a nonbinding referendum on Chavez's rule in February, a vote
approved by the country's electoral body.</TE>
<TE>   Chavez has said he will accept a referendum only in August, when
his term is half spent.</TE>
<TE>   Frustrated opposition leaders said the strike was necessary to
force Chavez to allow the referendum and persuade him to return
control of the Caracas police to Pena. Many in the opposition see the
police as the only armed protection against a military that Chavez is
moving to bring under tight control.</TE>
<TE>   Opposition leaders have refused to say how long the strike will
continue, though most observers believe it will last between 48 and
72 hours, depending on how many people participate and whether
violence erupts. The last strike, in October, lasted a day and won
widespread support without major disturbances.</TE>
<TE>   "The idea of the strike is to apply pressure at the negotiating
table -- to find an electoral way out of this crisis," said Carlos
Ortega, the head of the Confederation of Venezuelan Workers, which,
with a million members, is the country's largest union.</TE>
<TE>   One crucial measure of the strike will be the participation of the
all-important oil sector, which supplies half the government's
revenue. During the October strike, oil production continued without
interruption after Chavez gave workers a 35% pay raise in September.</TE>
<TE>   The threat of a walkout brought a stern rebuke from Ali Rodriguez,
the head of Venezuela's state oil company, PDVSA, and past president
of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries. He warned
oil workers to show up for their jobs or risk losing a Christmas
bonus equal to one month's pay.</TE>
<TE>   Oil analysts said the strike was unlikely to have an effect on
production if it lasted less than two or three days.</TE>
<TE>   "I'd like to ask all Venezuelans, and especially petroleum
workers, to reflect," Rodriguez said. "What do you win and what do
you lose if you paralyze this country's oil production?"</TE>
<TE>   The sharp rhetoric has concealed small, hopeful signs from the
negotiating table.</TE>
<TE>   "My sense is that negotiations are perhaps the last hope for a
peaceful solution ... to the crisis," said Jose Miguel Vivanco,
Americas director for New York-based Human Rights Watch.</TE>

<HD>Pirated Files Clog College Networks</HD>
<DH>Student downloads flood systems and draw complaints from
entertainment firms.</DH>

<LD>Alex Honigman can't remember exactly what he was looking for on the
Web that October night, but he insists it wasn't what he ended up
with: the latest Clint Eastwood movie.</LD>
<LD>   Nonetheless, when the Pitzer College junior clicked open the file
containing scenes from the Eastwood thriller "Blood Work," he tripped
an electronic alarm system at Warner Bros., the film's producer,
which then notified his Claremont school.</LD>
<LD>   In no time, Honigman, 20, was suspended briefly from the campus
computer network and required to write a letter of apology to the
Hollywood studio. Pitzer administrators also warned him that a second
offense could bring a year's suspension from the network.</LD>
<TE>   "They told me ... Warner Bros. could prosecute the college,"
Honigman said. "It was pretty unnerving."</TE>
<TE>   Pitzer, along with many other U.S. colleges, is struggling to
contain the flood of unauthorized music and movie files moving
through campus computer networks. The actions are spurred in part by
growing complaints from the entertainment industry that students are,
in effect, stealing copyrighted material.</TE>
<TE>   But colleges also have a more practical concern: The near-constant
downloading of songs, movies, games and software is overwhelming many
campus networks, slowing their use in research and teaching.</TE>
<TE>   "When this starts impairing the legitimate academic pursuits of
faculties and students, you have to do something," said Sheldon
Steinbach, general counsel of the American Council on Education, a
leading advocacy group for colleges and universities.</TE>
<TE>   In the most severe campus crackdown to date, the Naval Academy
last month confiscated the computers of nearly 100 students suspected
of having downloaded unauthorized copies of music and movies. The
midshipmen, who are bound by an ethics code that bars cheating and
stealing, could face penalties from loss of leave to court-martial
and expulsion, a spokesman said.</TE>
<TE>   Most schools, including Pitzer, are taking a more measured
approach. Many administrators are reluctant to become virtual police
or snoop into students' private lives. Nevertheless, colleges are
using new technologies that limit network capacity for file-swapping,
adopting stiffer disciplinary policies and making renewed attempts to
teach students about copyright laws.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a teachable moment," Steinbach said. "If we don't try and
impart the value of intellectual property when these young men and
women are students, we will have failed to take advantage of an
incredible opportunity."</TE>
<TE>   Film companies have a new tool to help: automated detection
systems -- called "spying" devices by students -- that can be hidden
in pirated files. These virtual alarms alert the copyright holder to
an unauthorized user and can pinpoint that person's Internet address.
As in Honigman's case, a college can be notified when there's a
problem.</TE>
<TE>   The toughest challenge may be to convince students that what they
are doing is wrong. Downloading has almost become a way of life.</TE>
<TE>   "It's right there in front of your face, and it's so easy," said
Matt Turzo, an 18-year-old Pitzer student from Pennsylvania. "You're
not going to not do it."</TE>
<TE>   His friend Liz Whippy, 19, a sophomore, agreed. "We get letters
from the deans about it sometimes but most of us are, like, delete,
delete. They're serious, but I guess we kind of turn a deaf ear to
it."</TE>
<TE>   Universities are trying to make sure they are heard. Even liberal
institutions such as Pitzer are starting to talk -- and act --
tougher.</TE>
<TE>   "When they get that letter [from the college] saying there's
potential FBI action, that really gets their attention," said Mark
Ingalls, Pitzer's director of information technology.</TE>
<TE>   The entertainment industry has been leaning on college
administrators to do their part. Industry groups sent a joint letter
to 2,300 colleges and universities in October, urging them to crack
down on unauthorized file swapping and to warn their students of
possible consequences.</TE>
<TE>   " 'Theft' is a harsh word, but that it is, pure and simple," the
groups stated. "Students must know that if they pirate copyrighted
works they are subject to legal liability."</TE>
<TE>   That letter was followed by a mailing from six higher education
associations to colleges, asking them to review their policies on the
matter and consider using the latest technologies to fight it.</TE>
<TE>   Representatives of higher education groups and movie and recording
industry organizations will meet in Washington, D.C., next week to
discuss the issue, said John Vaughn, executive vice president of the
Assn. of American Universities. "Our sense is that this is clearly
enough of a problem now that it needs a more comprehensive look."</TE>
<TE>   Universities have struggled with the issue for several years,
since the advent of the now-defunct Napster, the first Internet
file-sharing service, made it simple for users to copy music online
for free. But the problem has grown, with new generations of students
taking advantage of Napster successors such as Kazaa -- and the
high-speed connections available on many campuses.</TE>
<TE>   Many colleges have adopted computer use policies that prohibit
students from downloading or distributing copyrighted material
without permission.</TE>
<TE>   Lately, some colleges have taken other steps, including limiting
the amount of system capacity a single student can use or separating
dorm Internet traffic from that originating elsewhere on campus. The
reason is that many computer networks are so swamped with files from
unauthorized downloading that faculty -- and even some students --
say they can't do their work.</TE>
<TE>   Complaints to campus computer experts are widespread. At the
University of Santa Clara, for example, faculty members say they
can't use technology in their evening classes. At the University of
Maryland, dorm residents say slow connections are hampering their
studies.</TE>
<TE>   Many colleges this year have expanded their campus capacity, or
bandwidth. Others say they're reluctant to take that step. "We really
haven't wanted to increase the bandwidth to handle traffic that we
think is inappropriate," said Pitzer's Ingalls.</TE>
<TE>   But higher education officials are leery of enforcement activities
that they believe might stray into issues of academic freedom or
privacy. And most colleges stop well short of monitoring the content
of downloaded files, unless they are notified by copyright holders of
a specific violation.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't see that I have any business going into students'
computers and seeing what they have there," said Ken Pflueger,
executive director of information technology at Pomona College, a
sister school to Pitzer. "Frankly, I try to stay out of really
knowing what it is they're doing."</TE>
<TE>   At UCLA too, officials say they are taking technical steps to
manage the problem, giving lower priority on their network, for
example, to the types of files associated with Kazaa and other
file-swapping services. But they also steer clear of monitoring
content.</TE>
<TE>   "Of course, it's a balance," said Jim Davis, UCLA's vice
chancellor for information technology. "We want to honor copyrights,
but we also believe that we should not be in the business of policing
our students."</TE>
<TE>   Davis said the university also is using meetings in dorms and at
student orientations to explain that users of the campus network are
prohibited from unauthorized copying.</TE>
<TE>   Students often aren't convinced. In a dorm room at Pitzer one
recent night, Whippy and other students tried to justify their
downloading: It stimulates concert-going, one said. It helps
fledgling bands by introducing their music to a wider audience,
another offered.</TE>
<TE>   And the bottom line: Music is far too expensive anyway, and the
only ones who really profit are greedy big-name artists and record
companies.</TE>
<TE>   Whippy said she hadn't bought a new CD in at least four years.
Turzo added: "I can't shell out that kind of money. I think I've
developed a complex about buying CDs at this point."</TE>
<TE>   Evan Doty, a junior majoring in organizational studies, said he
has his own electronic code of ethics. He downloads music, television
shows and software all the time, but also tries to support musicians
he likes by buying their CDs. He showed off a fat CD wallet stuffed
with discs.</TE>
<TE>   "All purchased," he said proudly.</TE>
<TE>   The students spoke of friends in the dorm last year who provided
downloaded movies for sale, with a list of about 400 titles taped to
their door for friends to peruse. Dorm mates would make their pick,
plunk down $1 and a blank CD -- or $3 if they didn't have one handy
-- and wait a few minutes while their copy of the movie was burned.</TE>
<TE>   "It's cheaper than a rental, it's here, and you have it forever,"
Whippy said.</TE>
<TE>   All of which makes Honigman, who got caught and disciplined, feel
just a little embittered -- although not at Pitzer administrators,
who treated him sensitively, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Honigman said he doesn't use Kazaa or other file-sharing services
anymore; he can't take the risk.</TE>
<TE>   "So I don't download TV shows now, but what difference does it
make?" he asked. "Everyone else in the dorm where I live does, and
they could all just send them over to me. It's really kind of
pointless because these companies are never going to stop this."</TE>

<HD>Reach of Fair Housing Act Crux of High Court Case</HD>
<DH>At issue is whether supervisors can be sued if agent showed
bias toward a buyer.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>David G. Savage</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>TWENTYNINE PALMS</DL>
<LD>The plight of a mixed-race couple who were turned away from buying a
house in this small desert town will come before the Supreme Court
this week in a case that will decide who can be held liable for
blatant racial discrimination in real estate sales.</LD>
<LD>   At issue is whether brokers and supervisors can be sued if an
agent discriminates against a potential buyer.</LD>
<LD>   Realtors are urging the court to strictly limit the reach of the
Fair Housing Act. They say the law should punish only those who
engage in misconduct.</LD>
<TE>   But civil rights lawyers say the only way to stop discrimination
in home sales is to hold supervisors and brokers liable for the
actions of their sales staff.</TE>
<TE>   When it passed the housing rights law in 1968, Congress made it
illegal to discriminate against prospective buyers or renters because
of race.</TE>
<TE>   Yet, racial bias in real estate persists across the nation, civil
rights lawyers say. About one in five black or Latino buyers
experiences discrimination when inquiring about a newly advertised
house, according to a recent study of 20 metropolitan markets,
including Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Under state law, real estate brokers are licensed, and typically
one broker manages a staff of agents.</TE>
<TE>   "When we hand you a license [as a broker], it says you are
responsible. The burden is on you," says John Relman, a lawyer for
the National Fair Housing Alliance in Washington. "The best deterrent
to discrimination on a day-to-day basis is to hold the broker liable
for it."</TE>
<TE>   Dave Meyer, a broker and former owner of Triad Realtors whose case
is before the Supreme Court, says it is unfair to be sued personally
for something he did not do.</TE>
<TE>   "Everyone acknowledges I was not involved in this. I've never met
the Holleys," said Meyer, referring to the couple who sued for
discrimination. "Who in their right mind would want a job in this
industry if everything you and your family have worked for can be put
at risk?"</TE>
<TE>   The National Assn. of Realtors and the California Assn. of
Realtors support Meyer. But Bush administration lawyers side with the
Holleys, saying that, at least in some instances, an owner and broker
can be held liable if he failed to supervise his agents.</TE>
<TE>   The Supreme Court will hear arguments in the case Tuesday of Meyer
vs. Holley.</TE>
<TE>   It was 1996 when Mary Holley, a registered nurse, and her husband,
Dave, a Kmart employee, decided they needed a larger house to make
room for their growing son and her ailing father. And they had the
money to buy, because they were selling a small house in Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   But their house hunt proved frustrating.</TE>
<TE>   $150,000 to Spend</TE>
<TE>   They contacted Triad Realtors, the leading real estate firm in
town, and said they were willing to pay about $150,000, an ample sum
in the depressed market of Twentynine Palms.</TE>
<TE>   The Marine Corps base on the edge of town is the largest employer,
but the base went into decline after the Persian Gulf War ended in
1991 and took the housing market down with it, residents say.</TE>
<TE>   The Holleys said Triad agent Grove Crank, an ex-Marine, showed
them only a few smallish homes and some others that were well beyond
their means.</TE>
<TE>   When driving around, they spotted a new home under construction on
the other side of town. The Holleys knew the builder, Brooks Bauer,
and he said he was asking $145,000 for it. They told him they were
very interested.</TE>
<TE>   The home was listed with Triad. They toured the home with a young
agent and liked what they saw.</TE>
<TE>   There was only one unpleasant moment, said Mary Holley, who is
black and whose husband is white. She was standing in the driveway
when a senior agent at Triad, who happened to live next door, stopped
by. "She said, 'Oh, it's you,' " Holley said, a comment that struck
her as odd.</TE>
<TE>   But the house had the extra rooms they wanted, and they told the
Triad agent they planned to make an offer. They would put down $5,000
now and pay the asking price of $145,000 when it was completed.</TE>
<TE>   Not Enough</TE>
<TE>   That evening, the agent who had shown them the house called to say
the senior agents in the office, including Crank, said the $5,000
down payment was not sufficient. When the Holleys went to Triad the
next day, they said, the agent confirmed that their offer was too
low. Upset and angry, they left.</TE>
<TE>   A few months later, Bauer saw Holley at a store and said he was
surprised she had not put in an offer on the house.</TE>
<TE>   "I said we would have loved to have bought the house, but they
didn't want to take our offer," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Bauer was upset and surprised. He became even more so after he
stopped by to talk to Crank at Triad. He said Crank described the
Holleys as a "salt-and-pepper team" and dismissed them with a racial
epithet.</TE>
<TE>   "I never expected to hear something like it. It was as clear as
could be they had been discriminated against. And that's just wrong,"
Bauer said.</TE>
<TE>   By then, Bauer had sold the new home for $20,000 less than the
Holleys had been willing to pay. He reported the incident and Crank's
comment to a fair housing group.</TE>
<TE>   After the Holleys learned the full story, they joined with Bauer
in suing Crank and Triad Realtors under the Fair Housing Act.</TE>
<TE>   But the lawyers soon discovered a problem. Neither Triad nor Crank
had any assets.</TE>
<TE>   Civil rights lawyers say they were not surprised. Real estate
firms are often "mom-and-pop operations," lawyer Relman said. "The
company has desks, a few chairs and some cell phones. So, if you sue
the company, they say, 'Sorry, we have no money.' "</TE>
<TE>   Triad had insurance, but its policy excluded acts of
discrimination.</TE>
<TE>   So the lawsuit was amended to include Meyer, Triad's founder,
president and broker. Unlike his co-workers, Meyer and his wife had
several houses and pieces of property.</TE>
<TE>   Now 60, Meyer said he withdrew from the real estate agency's
day-to-day operation by the mid-1990s and left Crank in charge.</TE>
<TE>   Before the Holleys' suit could go to trial, Meyer tried to have
himself removed from the case.</TE>
<TE>   A federal judge in Los Angeles ruled Meyer cannot be held liable
for the discrimination by Crank and Triad Realtors.</TE>
<TE>   But the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals disagreed and ruled the
Fair Housing Act should be read broadly to outlaw discrimination by
all those who "direct or control" the buying and selling of homes.</TE>
<TE>   The decision sent a jolt through the real estate industry, and
when Meyer appealed to the Supreme Court, he was backed by the
industry.</TE>
<TE>   "Brokers have a duty to supervise, but we don't think they should
be strictly liable for the actions of others," said June Barlow,
general counsel for the California Assn. of Realtors in Los Angeles.
There are nearly 209,000 real estate salespeople in the state, and
most of them work for a corporate broker like Meyer, she said. But
the Holleys' lawyers say Meyer failed to carry out his legal duties.</TE>
<TE>   "This case presents the unusual circumstances where a corporate
officer-owner and real estate broker completely abdicated his
responsibilities for supervising his real estate salespersons," said
Elizabeth Brancart, a fair-housing expert from Pescadero who
represents the Holleys.</TE>
<TE>   For its part, the Supreme Court has said remarkably little about
the Fair Housing Act over its 34-year history. It has decided only
half a dozen cases, and most of them came in the early 1970s. Then, a
more liberal court broadened the reach of the law by allowing more
people to bring claims for housing discrimination. Testers, as well
as actual buyers or renters, can serve as plaintiffs in suits for
housing bias, the court said.</TE>
<TE>   But the justices have not ruled on how broadly the liability can
be assessed once the discrimination is proved.</TE>
<TE>   If the Holleys prevail in the Supreme Court, the case will return
to Los Angeles for a trial.</TE>
<TE>   But if Meyer prevails in the Supreme Court, the case will likely
end. The plaintiffs' lawyers say it would be foolish to try a case of
housing discrimination if no judgment can be paid at the end.</TE>
<TE>   Grove Crank, the original target of the suit, has been all but
forgotten. In an interview, he denied making any racist comments.
"I've known [the Holleys] since they came to town. I showed them
houses. I even showed them my own house once. I could care less what
color they are."</TE>
<TE>   The Marine veteran blames the Holleys for walking out and not
pursuing the house they wanted. "We had no offer from them," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "In all honesty, I think this is about greed. They are hunting for
a pot of gold."</TE>
<TE>   Holley said she and her husband gave up hunting for a new home,
and that she remains saddened by the experience.</TE>
<TE>   Her father eventually went to a nursing home.</TE>
<TE>   "I think about that a lot. All we wanted was a bigger home," she
said. "I suppose God didn't want us to move after all."</TE>

<HD>Cell Phones and Driving a Lethal Mix, Study Says</HD>
<DH>The devices are linked to 2,600 annual fatalities, up from
1,000 two years ago, researchers find.</DH>

<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The death toll from crashes caused by drivers talking on their cell
phones appears to be rising significantly as the devices become a
must-have accessory for many Americans.</LD>
<LD>   A study released today by Harvard University's Center for Risk
Analysis estimates a rate of 2,600 deaths a year in such crashes,
compared to the same researchers' estimate of 1,000 fatalities only
two years ago.</LD>
<LD>   "The amount of time people spend using their cell phones while
driving has increased, probably reflecting the fact that it is
becoming cheaper to use the devices," said research scientist Joshua
Cohen, the study's author.</LD>
<TE>   The Harvard study also estimated that 570,000 injuries a year and
1.5 million property damage crashes can be blamed on cell phone use.</TE>
<TE>   Last year in California, at least 4,699 reported accidents were
blamed on drivers using cell phones, and those crashes killed 31
people and injured 2,786, according to a recent analysis by The
Times. CHP Commissioner Dwight O. "Spike" Hemlick has reversed a
previous stance against restrictions and now says he will back
legislation requiring California motorists to use only hands-free
cell phones.</TE>
<TE>   Nationally, the Harvard study will feed into a debate that pits
personal freedom and convenience against safety concerns. Two federal
agencies have recently stepped up efforts to understand how cell
phone use may contribute to accidents. The National Transportation
Safety Board is investigating cell phones as a potential contributing
factor in several recent serious crashes. The National Highway
Traffic Safety Administration is launching a study of how cell phone
use affects individual drivers, using the government's driving
simulator facility in Iowa.</TE>
<TE>   Nationwide, there is no uniform measure for tracking accidents in
which cell phone use may have been a factor.</TE>
<TE>   The Harvard study used mathematical models to estimate the risk of
injury and death as well as the costs and benefits of using cell
phones while driving. The risk analysis center is part of Harvard's
School of Public Health.</TE>
<TE>   In a key finding for policymakers, the study concluded that the
escalating costs of cell phone-related accidents are erasing the
economic benefits of unrestricted use of the devices by drivers.</TE>
<TE>   Previous economic analysis by Harvard researchers had found that
the benefits of being able to readily communicate for business or
pleasure while on the road clearly outweighed the social costs of
injuries and deaths in accidents.</TE>
<TE>   Cohen's latest calculations found that the costs are now roughly
equal to the benefits.</TE>
<TE>   "The risk is growing, but the benefits are not keeping up," Cohen
said. Such conclusions could bolster the case for restricting cell
phone use by drivers.</TE>
<TE>   This year, at least 22 states considered legislation to restrict
cell phone use while driving, according to the Insurance Institute
for Highway Safety.</TE>
<TE>   So far, only New York has enacted a partial prohibition. It does
not allow drivers to use hand-held phones. New Yorkers may use
devices adapted for hands-free use, which are usu- ally
voice-activated and come with an earpiece and microphone.</TE>
<TE>   It is too early to tell whether New York's law, which went into
effect last year, is saving lives. A preliminary study indicated that
the law has changed the behavior of motorists, and that use of
hand-held phones appears to be down by about 50%.</TE>
<TE>   Cell phone use is by no means the biggest menace on the roads.
Alcohol-related crashes accounted for 17,448 deaths last year, while
accidents involving speeding took 12,850 lives, according to federal
statistics.</TE>
<TE>   But much less is known about the link between cell phone use and
crashes than about the effects of alcohol or speeding. In most
states, accident report forms used by police do not collect
information on whether drivers were on the phone.</TE>
<TE>   The cell phone industry -- which has more than 128 million
customers -- has refused to turn over customer records that would
allow researchers to pinpoint whether drivers were in fact on the
phone at the time of an accident.</TE>
<TE>   A 1997 study of Canadian drivers who agreed to have their cell
phone records scrutinized found that the risk of an accident was four
times greater while a driver was using the phone.</TE>
<TE>   Similar research needs to be done in the U.S., said Russ Rader, an
insurance safety institute spokesman. "Intuitively, you know there
has to be some sort of risk there," he said. "There has to be an
element of distraction. But how great a risk that is has not been
nailed down."</TE>
<TE>   Cohen, the author of the Harvard study, said federal and state
agencies should commission more research before any decision to
restrict cell phone use. That way, lawmakers can be sure that the
solutions they come up with will work.</TE>
<TE>   Although New York's ban on hand-held phones has generated
widespread interest, Cohen said research indicates it might not be
the most effective approach. The Canadian study found that hands-free
phones did not appear to reduce the risk of getting into an accident.
Crashes "may result from drivers' limitations with regard to
attention rather than dexterity," the Canadian authors suggested.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't have the data to make the best policy we need to make,"
Cohen said.</TE>
<TE>   The cell phone industry strongly opposes restrictions on
motorists, but it has launched a safety education campaign that
discourages drivers from engaging in stressful conversations while
behind the wheel, and urges them to avoid using their phones in bad
weather, heavy traffic or while driving in unfamiliar territory. The
industry encourages the use of hands-free phones.</TE>
<TE>   "There are laws already in place that allow an officer to stop and
ticket a driver for distracted driving," said Kim Kuo, a spokeswoman
for the Cellular Telecommunications and Internet Assn. "We feel it's
going to be ineffective if you just pass laws and ignore the need for
education."</TE>
<TE>   But Cohen said there are social implications to irresponsible cell
phone habits that may have to be addressed by lawmakers. The motorist
talking on the phone is not the only one who can get hurt in a crash.
Occupants of other vehicles and pedestrians are also at risk.</TE>
<TE>   "We have a public health issue that needs to be looked at
carefully," Cohen said.</TE>

<HD>The Only Sense Is of Loss</HD>
<DH>Michael Carneal can't explain why he shot his classmates
five years ago. Missy Jenkins, now paralyzed, goes on with life but
can't go back.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The flashbacks start, for Missy Jenkins, with "Amen."</LD>
<LD>   She is holding hands with friends in the lobby of her high school,
praying. It is the Monday after Thanksgiving. She skipped church the
day before to see a movie. But she never misses morning prayer
circle.</LD>
<LD>   "Amen."</LD>
<TE>   The three dozen students drop hands.</TE>
<TE>   Then Missy sees a girl, a friend, crumple. She hears a pop. Nicole
is on the floor, limp, bloody. Missy can't make sense of it. A prank,
she thinks. Man, she thinks, man, is someone going to be in trouble.
She hears screams. She sees students whirling, a blur of motion.
Another pop.</TE>
<TE>   Missy feels herself sliding to the floor. Her twin sister, Mandy,
dives on top of her. The screaming is so loud. She can't think. And
then, she can. And then, she knows.</TE>
<TE>   "Mandy," she says. "I can't feel my stomach.</TE>
<TE>   "I can't feel my stomach! What does that mean?"</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The flashbacks start, for Michael Carneal, with chipped plaster.</TE>
<TE>   He can't make sense of it.</TE>
<TE>   He remembers, as through a mist, loading two shotguns, two
semiautomatic rifles and 700 rounds of ammunition in the trunk of his
sister's car that morning, the whole arsenal wrapped in blankets. An
English project, he had explained. He remembers lugging the bundle
into school. He remembers chatting about nothing with his friends. He
remembers pulling a fifth gun, a revolver, out of his backpack as
morning prayer circle broke up.</TE>
<TE>   And now he's staring at this gouge in the wall, at plaster knocked
loose by a bullet.</TE>
<TE>   Michael looks around. He sees kids on the floor, crying,
screaming. His friend Nicole is down there. She's still. Then he sees
another student walking toward him, a boy, approaching slowly through
the noise.</TE>
<TE>   "What are you doing?" the boy asks, calm.</TE>
<TE>   "Shooting people," Michael hears himself answer.</TE>
<TE>   "What for?" the boy asks. He draws closer.</TE>
<TE>   Michael answers: "I don't know."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The flashbacks come again and again and again.</TE>
<TE>   Five years ago, Michael Carneal, a skinny freshman, opened fire at
Heath High School in West Paducah, Ky. He killed three classmates:
Nicole Hadley, 14, who marched with him in band, 15-year-old Kayce
Steger, and 17-year-old Jessica James. He also wounded five. Most of
the injuries were minor. Missy Jenkins' was not.</TE>
<TE>   The bullet entered just below her left collarbone, slammed through
her -- nicking her lung, her spinal cord -- and came out by her right
shoulder blade. She is paralyzed from the chest down.</TE>
<TE>   The bloodshed in the working-class river town -- the young girls
gunned down in the Bible Belt as they prayed -- rattled the nation.
Exactly two months earlier, a 16-year-old boy had stabbed his mother
to death, then killed two classmates at his high school in Pearl,
Miss. But that tragedy had not grabbed national attention the way the
shootings in western Kentucky did.</TE>
<TE>   Carnage in other schoolyards would follow, all too often: in
Jonesboro, Ark., and Springfield, Ore., in Conyers, Ga., and Fort
Gibson, Okla., at Santana High School near San Diego and at Columbine
High in Littleton, Colo., where two students killed 12 classmates and
a teacher before turning their guns on themselves.</TE>
<TE>   Michael Carneal would hold himself responsible for inspiring such
rampages.</TE>
<TE>   Missy Jenkins would make it her mission to prevent them.</TE>
<TE>   He would feel guilt ripping at him, through the flashbacks. She
would shake off each nightmare with fresh resolve. Neither one wants
that shattering morning to define them. But it has.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   "I think about it all the time," Michael Carneal says.</TE>
<TE>   He slouches into his chair in a conference room at the Kentucky
State Reformatory in LaGrange. He is 19 years old now -- tall, pudgy,
pasty, with a scraggly beard and clunky square glasses. It's hard to
see in him the scrawny, skittish freshman who pulled out a
.22-caliber Ruger, pressed foam plugs in his ears and opened fire
that Monday morning.</TE>
<TE>   It's hard even for Carneal.</TE>
<TE>   He knows he shot his friends. He remembers planning it. He
remembers thinking the night before, after a game of chess with his
dad: "Tomorrow, I go to prison." And now he is in prison, told when
to shower, what to wear, his biggest treat the microwave popcorn he
earns by keeping his cell tidy. It still does not feel real.</TE>
<TE>   "I know it was me," he says, "but it doesn't fit my character. I'm
not a violent person. A lot of people think I'm evil because of what
happened. That's not true. I made a mistake. A big mistake."</TE>
<TE>   He is on the psychiatric ward at the state reformatory, mellowed
by 11 pills a day. The medications push away the monsters he used to
see leering at his windows.</TE>
<TE>   The monsters came often in the months before the shooting. Carneal
would cover up the vents in the bathroom so the bad guys could not
grab him. At night, he felt them clutching his legs. He lived in
terror. Yet he told no one. He played baritone in band. He played
pranks on his friends. His parents noticed nothing.</TE>
<TE>   Carneal told several classmates before Thanksgiving that
"something big" was going to happen in school. He warned them the
"day of reckoning" was near. But he was always goofing around --
passing off parsley as pot, wearing the mat from a Twister game to
school as a cape -- and no one paid much attention. He felt always
alone.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought I might as well go to prison because I didn't have
anything to lose," he says.</TE>
<TE>   That doesn't explain why he murdered, though. Michael Carneal has
spent five years searching for an answer.</TE>
<TE>   He doesn't have one.</TE>
<TE>   "That makes it all that much worse," he says.</TE>
<TE>   He watches news of other kids killing kids in other schools and he
feels helpless to stop the spasms of violence, the awful trend he
believes he touched off that awful morning. "If I don't understand my
own motivation," he says, "how can I understand theirs?"</TE>
<TE>   He says he's sorry. He says it often. His voice is flat. His eyes
are blank.</TE>
<TE>   In a sagging brown jumpsuit and high-top sneakers, Carneal spends
his days in the medium-security prison playing crazy eights or
shooting pool, reading, writing, talking to psychologists. He is
locked in his cell only at night. It's a single cell, with a TV and a
radio. His parents come to visit every weekend. They bring him cash,
now and then, to buy oatmeal cream pies at the canteen.</TE>
<TE>   Carneal was given a life sentence but will be eligible for parole
in 20 years. He does not allow himself to think what he might do if
he gets out. He really has no idea.</TE>
<TE>   He never thought much about the future, back when he had one.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Missy Jenkins, three weeks shy of her 20th birthday, wheels
through the holiday clutter of her apartment in Murray, Ky., dodging
poinsettias as she maneuvers to the VCR. She picks through the tapes:
"Scent of a Woman." "Young Guns." Then she finds what she's looking
for, and pops it in.</TE>
<TE>   Her own image fills the screen: a slight teenager with long blond
hair seated at a pink vanity table, putting on makeup. "My name is
Missy Jenkins," she says in voice-over. "I had a GPA of 3.3. I was
homecoming queen runner-up. I was vice president of my junior class.
I was shot by a classmate."</TE>
<TE>   The camera pans to show her black wheelchair, her long, thin,
useless legs. "I'm one of the lucky ones."</TE>
<TE>   It's a public-service announcement she filmed this year for a
national anti-violence campaign in the schools.</TE>
<TE>   She has been lending her voice to similar efforts since the day
after the shooting, when she answered questions from her hospital bed
on national TV. She has taken her message to the White House and on
MTV, has spoken before tens of thousands of students across the
country.</TE>
<TE>   All the while, she has pushed through a grueling rehabilitation,
learning first to live using a wheelchair and then to walk short
distances with special braces. Three years ago, Mandy as always at
her side, she walked across the stage at Heath High to claim her
diploma. The next year, she shuffled the first quarter-mile of the
Los Angeles marathon, in pouring rain, just to prove she could.</TE>
<TE>   Her efforts have earned her acclaim: She won a federal
crime-prevention award. She appeared onstage at the 2000 Democratic
National Convention, in a tribute to heroes.</TE>
<TE>   But Missy Jenkins does not want to be a hero.</TE>
<TE>   She wants to be exactly what she is: A college junior at Murray
State University in western Kentucky, majoring in social work.</TE>
<TE>   She wants to get to her manicure appointment on time, persuade her
sister to help her write a play for drama class, gossip with a
roommate about the guy she hopes will ask her out. She wants to raise
money for arthritis research with her sorority.</TE>
<TE>   She wants to marry. She wants to be a mom. She wants to get an
agent, to act in L.A.</TE>
<TE>   She wants to do everything she would have done had Carneal not
squeezed that trigger. She wants to be the same person she would have
been.</TE>
<TE>   "I think I am the same person," she says, "the exact same person."</TE>
<TE>   And yet, now and then, loss shadows Jenkins' bright, open face.
She wonders how she will be able to lift a crying baby from a crib.
She wonders how she will be able to grocery shop for a family.</TE>
<TE>   She misses dancing.</TE>
<TE>   She wonders when she should tell her boyfriends all the
embarrassing truths about her body. When she should show them her
catheter. Or the 16 pills she takes each day to ward off muscle
spasms and bladder infections.</TE>
<TE>   She hates to be alone, because sometimes she falls as she hoists
herself from wheelchair to bed and finds herself stuck on the floor,
needing rescue.</TE>
<TE>   Missy Jenkins may be the exact same person. But she is forever
changed.</TE>
<TE>   "I think about it every day," she says.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Missy and Michael knew each other in high school. It would have
been surprising if they hadn't, in a school with just 486 students.
They marched together in band. They teased each other.</TE>
<TE>   One day, as one of his practical jokes, Michael wore a button he
had made with a picture of the blond-streaked twins. The next day,
Missy and Mandy countered with their own homemade Michael buttons.
"He was a fun guy," Missy says. "Not creepy. The class clown. I try
to picture him with the gun, but it's hard, because I knew him."</TE>
<TE>   A year after the shooting, Michael tried to reach out to Missy. He
wrote several letters. He called. Finally, Missy's father contacted
an attorney. Michael was ordered to stop.</TE>
<TE>   Looking back, he says he's not sure what he so urgently wanted to
tell her. That he was sorry? That he could not explain?</TE>
<TE>   Missy did not want to hear from him. She had confronted him once,
in court. She wheeled up to him and, holding his gaze, told him about
her catheter and muscle spasms, about her fears, her loss, her
determination to make her pain mean something.</TE>
<TE>   "I told him I forgave him, not to make him feel better, but so I
could move on," she recalls. "I told him I would miss out on a lot,
but I would not miss out on life." He listened to her in silence.</TE>
<TE>   He falls silent now, thinking of what he would say to Missy if he
saw her. The silence stretches a long moment. He gives up. "There's
nothing you can say."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Students walking into Heath High this morning will see a wreath on
the memorial stone in the school courtyard. No public ceremony is
planned. There is no need. Reminders are everywhere in West Paducah.</TE>
<TE>   Teachers stand each morning at the high school's door. They search
book bags. But they also talk, and listen, trying to win students'
trust, to counsel and console, to reach out to anyone who seems edgy.
Almost all the teachers who were on staff during the shooting remain
at Heath. Not one asked to transfer.</TE>
<TE>   The Carneal family is still in town too. Michael's sister
graduated from Heath High seven months after the shooting, as class
valedictorian. His father, an attorney, still works downtown. His
mother waves back at the neighbors, as always.</TE>
<TE>   The Steger and James families remain in West Paducah as well, near
the gravestones of their girls. The Hadleys moved to Chicago. Former
Principal Bill Bond saw every student touched by the tragedy through
graduation. Then he took a job as a national school safety
consultant. He starts to say that life is back to normal now. Then he
corrects himself:</TE>
<TE>   "It will never return to normal. Those 12 seconds changed
everything for everyone involved."</TE>
<TE>   Christmas decorations twinkled in West Paducah this weekend. But
through the cheer, on this devastating anniversary, many will mourn.
Many will remember.</TE>

<HD>Australia Backs Preemptive Hits on Terrorists</HD>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>SYDNEY, Australia</DL>
<LD>Prime Minister John Howard said Sunday that he was prepared to act
against terrorists in neighboring countries and suggested that the
U.N. Charter be changed to allow nations to launch preemptive strikes
against terrorists planning to attack them.</LD>
<LD>   His remarks drew condemnation from Asian governments.</LD>
<LD>   In October, a terrorist bombing on Indonesia's resort island of
Bali killed 191 people, almost half of them Australians.</LD>
<TE>   "If you believe that somebody was going to launch an attack on
your country ... and you had a capacity to stop it and there was no
alternative ... then of course you would have to use it," he told
local television.</TE>
<TE>   Asked whether that meant taking preemptive action against
terrorists in a neighboring country, he said: "Oh yes. I think any
Australian prime minister would."</TE>
<TE>   Indonesian legislator Alvin Lie called Howard's statement "very
dangerous" and said he "should learn to control himself."</TE>
<TE>   Thai government spokesman Ratthakit Manathat said: "Nobody does
anything like this. Each country has its own sovereignty; that must
be protected."</TE>

<HD>Disco Fire Kills 47 in Venezuela</HD>
<DH>Locked exit was a factor in the high number of deaths in a
packed nightclub in the capital, fire official says. Investigation
continues.</DH>

<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>CARACAS, Venezuela</DL>
<LD>A fire that ripped through a packed nightclub in this capital's
gritty industrial center early Sunday killed 47 people, one of the
deadliest such blazes in Venezuela in recent years.</LD>
<LD>   Firefighters arrived within minutes of the first report of the
blaze and found thick smoke pouring from the Goajira nightclub. They
evacuated 400 people from the club and 500 more from nearby
buildings, said Caracas Fire Chief Rodolfo Briceno.</LD>
<LD>   The cause of the fire remained unknown Sunday, but Briceno said a
locked exit door and overcrowding in the club contributed to the high
number of dead, most of whom died of smoke inhalation. At least 12
others were injured.</LD>
<TE>   "There was a dense, toxic smoke and lots of panic," Briceno said.
"Many people were trapped inside."</TE>
<TE>   Witnesses described a scene of terror and confusion as club-goers
fought to get out of the dance hall, located in the basement of a
13-story hotel.</TE>
<TE>   As the smoke grew thicker, hotel guests began fleeing through a
narrow passage next to the club entrance, leading to a bottleneck and
even more chaos.</TE>
<TE>   "People were saying, 'Run, run, run!' " said Monica Bottini, 30,
who was staying at the hotel with her husband. "I said, 'Honey, we're
going to die.' "</TE>
<TE>   Hotel guests began smashing windows and screaming for help from
passersby below. Bottini's husband, Hector Campos, 32, said he had to
grab a woman who was about to hurl herself from the ninth floor in a
desperate bid to escape.</TE>
<TE>   "In truth, it reminded me of the twin towers attack" of Sept. 11,
Campos said. "There was so much panic."</TE>
<TE>   On Sunday morning, firefighters lined up the bodies of the dead
along a sidewalk next to the club as friends and family members
arrived to learn the fate of loved ones.</TE>
<TE>   Crowds gathered throughout the day in front of the entrance to the
club, a blackened hole in the middle of a tightly packed row of small
stores.</TE>
<TE>   Briceno said investigators had just begun their inquiry into the
fire's causes, but he speculated that the blaze was accidental.
Possible causes included a short circuit or a cigarette.</TE>
<TE>   It was the deadliest nightclub blaze in decades in the capital. In
1985, 25 people died in a discotheque fire here, Briceno said.</TE>
<TE>   Nightclub fires are common in Latin America, where lax oversight
and a weak judicial system make it difficult to enforce fire safety
regulations.</TE>
<TE>   "It's no secret that these types of clubs often have faulty wiring
and that their electrical circuits are overcharged," the fire chief
told reporters.</TE>

<DL>KHAN BANI SAAD, Iraq</DL>
<LD>U.N. disarmament teams inspected a shabby, seldom-used airfield in
corn country north of Baghdad on Sunday where Iraqi experts
reportedly once tested a helicopter-mounted contraption that could
bombard enemy troops with killer microbes.</LD>
<LD>   The inspectors checked on equipment sealed and tagged by U.N.
teams in the 1990s and pored over paper and computer files, the
airfield's director said. The sprayer systems, unaccounted for since
the 1991 Persian Gulf War, were tested in the 1980s, a U.N. report
said.</LD>
<LD>   "We showed them everything," said Montadhar Radeef Mohammed, who
took over as airfield director in 1998. He told reporters he knew
nothing about the sprayer contraptions.</LD>
<TE>   As the inspectors searched the airfield, Iraqi officials said,
Western warplanes bombed an oil company office building in the
southern port city of Basra, killing four people and wounding 27. An
Iraqi military spokesman said two rockets hit the offices of the
Southern Oil Co. on Sunday morning. The company supervises the
country's oil exports under a U.N. program that allows Iraq to sell
oil for food.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. officials said U.S. and British planes policing the "no-fly"
zone attacked air defense facilities near Basra in response to Iraqi
antiaircraft artillery fire.</TE>

<HD>Throngs Protest Handling of Spill</HD>
<DH>Tens of thousands in northwestern Spain denounce government
as more oil washes up.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL>SANTIAGO DE COMPOSTELA, Spain</DL>
<LD>Tens of thousands of demonstrators packed the capital of Spain's
Galicia region Sunday to protest the government's handling of a
tanker disaster as a new wave of fuel oil hit Spanish beaches.</LD>
<LD>   The streets of Santiago de Compostela in northwestern Spain were
thronged with marchers upset by the destruction wrought on the
region's environment and fisheries by a huge oil spill from the
sunken tanker Prestige.</LD>
<LD>   Organizers of the march, held under the slogan "Never Again,"
estimated that as many as 200,000 people tromped through driving rain
under a sea of umbrellas. There was no official estimate, but one
local police officer agreed with that figure.</LD>
<TE>   Marcher Juan Raimundez, his clothes smeared with oil from the
cleanup, accused authorities of playing down the disaster. "You can't
lie and take the situation so lightly.... Those of us who've been to
clean up have no doubt it's a catastrophe."</TE>
<TE>   Demonstrators, criticizing the authorities' response to the spill
as slow and inadequate, called for the Spanish and Galician regional
governments to resign.</TE>
<TE>   Seventy miles away, on Galicia's "Coast of Death," patches of oil
from the 26-year-old tanker, which broke up and sank Nov. 19 in deep
Atlantic waters, continued to wash up.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, a large slick containing thousands of tons of oil was
about 19 miles offshore, Environment Minister Jaume Matas said. But
driving rain and shifting winds and currents made it difficult to
predict where the slick would end up.</TE>

<HD>Archdiocese May File for Chapter 11</HD>
<DH>Move would suspend civil suits against Boston church.
Spokeswoman calls report 'speculative.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>BOSTON</DL>
<LD>The Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Boston is preparing to file for
bankruptcy protection rather than face a costly legal battle that
could drag on for years, according to a published report.</LD>
<LD>   A spokeswoman for the archdiocese called the report "speculative
and premature."</LD>
<LD>   Senior advisors to Cardinal Bernard Law favor filing for
bankruptcy protection, and any decision must be approved by the
cardinal, according to the Boston Sunday Globe, citing an unnamed
senior church official and two unnamed sources close to the
archdiocese.</LD>
<TE>   An archdiocesan spokeswoman said Sunday that a decision on
bankruptcy had not been made but that every option is being
considered.</TE>
<TE>   "Any reports in the media with regards to this are speculative and
premature," Donna Morrissey said.</TE>
<TE>   "Our first desire is to settle in a fair and expeditious manner."</TE>
<TE>   If the archdiocese does file for protection under Chapter 11 of
the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, action in all civil lawsuits against the
archdiocese would be suspended and it would be protected from new
suits, according to the story.</TE>
<TE>   Filing for bankruptcy protection would mean that the archdiocese
is admitting that it is liable, but Law would no longer have to
answer questions in pretrial depositions and archdiocesan attorneys
would not have to release any more priests' personnel files to
plaintiffs' lawyers.</TE>
<TE>   This week, lawyers for alleged abuse victims will start to make
public the personnel files of 65 priests.</TE>
<TE>   Robert A. Sherman, an attorney at Greenberg Traurig, which
represents about half of the alleged victims, told the newspaper that
it is too early for the church to consider bankruptcy protection
before it even knows the amount of damages it faces. It also
contradicts Law's previous promises, he said.</TE>

<LD>Despite a budget crunch, the governor's mansion in Carson City has
undergone more than $590,000 in repairs this year.</LD>
<LD>   The work comes four years after completion of a $5.2-million
renovation project at the 93-year-old house. Unlike that project,
this year's work was funded by tax dollars. "You just have to spend
money to maintain a place like that," state Budget Director Perry
Comeaux told the Reno Gazette-Journal. "Ask anyone who owns one of
those Victorian mansions downtown. They are a money pit."</LD>

<HD>Judges Join Death-Row Debate</HD>
<DH>Ex-jurists urge clemency for inmates whose cases were
tainted by flaws in Illinois' system.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>CHICAGO</DL>
<LD>A group of retired state and federal judges is urging Gov. George
Ryan to commute the death sentences of any inmate whose conviction
was tainted by flaws in Illinois' capital punishment system.</LD>
<LD>   In a letter to Ryan released Sunday, Moses Harrison, a former
chief justice of Illinois, and 20 other judges suggested clemency for
scores of inmates, although they stopped short of asking the governor
to make a blanket commutation.</LD>
<LD>   Individually, however, some of the judges said the system is so
riddled with problems that Ryan should grant blanket clemency. "The
only way to be fair, the only way to be just, the only way to be
equal is for the governor to change the death sentences ... to life
without the possibility of parole," said R. Eugene Pincham, a former
state appellate judge.</LD>
<TE>   Retired state appellate Judge Anthony Scariano said that although
there must be changes in the law to protect defendants in the future,
"clemency is the proper way to address the problems of the past."</TE>
<TE>   Ryan's office did not immediately return phone calls Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   The judges listed the same problems that were raised by defense
attorneys during recently completed hearings. They included coerced
confessions, inadequate defense attorneys and testimony from
jailhouse informants and accomplices in exchange for such incentives
as lenient sentences.</TE>
<TE>   The letter was the latest volley in the public-relations battle
being waged since Ryan issued a moratorium on executions nearly three
years ago, saying he could no longer trust whether those on death row
were guilty.</TE>
<TE>   Since resuming capital punishment in 1977, Illinois courts have
found that 13 condemned men were wrongly convicted, while 12 have
been executed.</TE>

<HD>After 10-Day Cleaning, Cruise Ship Is Deemed Safe, Sets
Sail</HD>

<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla.</DL>
<LD>Holland America Line's cruise ship Amsterdam set sail Sunday, 10 days
after the company sidelined the ship, trying to eradicate a stomach
virus that has sickened more than 500 people.</LD>
<LD>   Holland America reassured the estimated 1,300 passengers who
boarded the Amsterdam at Port Everglades that it had thoroughly
disinfected the ship.</LD>
<LD>   "We are very confident that we have broken the cycle," Holland
America spokeswoman Rose Abello said.</LD>
<TE>   The Norwalk-like virus suspected of sickening the passengers is
one of many common illnesses that can cause diarrhea, stomach pain
and vomiting for 24 to 48 hours.</TE>
<TE>   Passengers and crew in four voyages became sick despite the cruise
line's attempts to clean the ship, so Holland America canceled the
previous 10-day cruise.</TE>
<TE>   More than 600 crew members spent 10 days cleaning the 780-foot
vessel, Abello said. Specialists from the federal Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention in Atlanta supervised.</TE>

<HD>Democrat Tops Hawaii Race for Rep. Mink's Term</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>HONOLULU</DL>
<LD>Democrat Ed Case, who lost in his party's primary for governor, won
the free-for-all election to fill the remaining five weeks of the
term of the late Rep. Patsy T. Mink, election officials said Sunday.</LD>
<LD>   Case got 23,576 votes, or 51% of those cast Saturday, for the 38
candidates running in the 2nd District, which includes rural Oahu and
the neighbor islands.</LD>
<LD>   Case may never cast a vote on the House floor during the short
term and may not even be sworn in because Congress is not in session.</LD>
<TE>   Still, he said, he sees his substantial victory as the momentum he
needs to get the job on a more permanent basis.</TE>
<TE>   Case is a candidate in the Jan. 4 special election to determine
who will serve the two-year term that Mink posthumously won in the
Nov. 5 general election.</TE>
<TE>   If he wins, Case would have the most seniority among the freshmen
in the next Congress.</TE>
<TE>   "If we can take this five-week responsibility and roll it over
into a two-year term and beyond, we will have seniority over other
members of Congress that were elected but are not yet members of
Congress," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Mink died of viral pneumonia on Sept. 28, two days too late to
have her name removed from the general election ballot.</TE>
<TE>   Case faces a number of prominent public figures from both parties.</TE>
<TE>   Among his challengers is former Democratic state Sen. Matt
Matsunaga, who lost as the Democrats' candidate for lieutenant
governor. Matsunaga is also the son of Case's political mentor.</TE>
<TE>   Another of the candidates in Saturday's special election was
Mink's widower, John Mink. He came in second with 16,624 votes, or
36%.</TE>
<TE>   Only 13% of the district's 348,000 registered voters turned out
for the election.</TE>

<HD>Kerry to Form Committee to Explore 2004 Run</HD>
<DH>Democratic senator will try to gauge whether he has backing
as a serious presidential candidate.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Lisa Getter</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Sen. John F. Kerry (D-Mass.) said Sunday that he is forming an
exploratory committee this week in anticipation of a 2004 bid for the
White House.</LD>
<LD>   "It's an enormous step and it's not one I take lightly, but it's
one that I'm excited about," the decorated Vietnam War veteran said
on NBC's "Meet the Press." "It's a challenge."</LD>
<LD>   Kerry's move was widely expected. Once he files the papers to
launch a committee, he can begin raising money to gauge whether he
has backing as a serious presidential candidate. A formal
announcement of his candidacy is "down the road some months," he
said.</LD>
<TE>   A recent Los Angeles Times Poll of Democratic Party insiders found
strong support for Kerry as the party's presidential candidate. The
poll found no clear-cut favorite, but when read a list of 10
prospective nominees, 19% of those surveyed named former Vice
President Al Gore, the party's presidential candidate in 2000, as
their top choice and 18% named Kerry. Nearly half those polled said
Gore should sit out the race.</TE>
<TE>   The Democratic field is expected to be crowded. Vermont Gov.
Howard Dean is exploring a bid. Missouri Rep. Richard A. Gephardt and
Sen. John Edwards of North Carolina also have expressed interest.
Gore has said that he will decide by early next month. His running
mate in 2000, Sen. Joseph I. Lieberman of Connecticut, has said that
he will run if Gore doesn't.</TE>
<TE>   "There are good people who are standing up. There are others who
will contest. That's part of the process," Kerry said Sunday. "I want
this to be a contest of ideas, and I want it to be based not on my
running against anybody, but running for a vision for this country."</TE>
<TE>   There is, he said, "deep anxiety" in America about "job security,
income security, retirement security, health security, education
security, physical, personal security and, of course, national
security. And, I think, literally on almost every issue facing the
country, I believe there is a better choice for this nation."</TE>
<TE>   Soon after graduating from Yale University in 1966, Kerry entered
the Navy, where he served on a gunboat in the Mekong Delta in
Vietnam. He received a Silver Star, a Bronze Star and three Purple
Hearts for his combat service. When he returned from Vietnam, he
began questioning U.S. involvement in that conflict, becoming a
spokesman for Vietnam Veterans Against the War.</TE>
<TE>   Kerry, 58, was a lawyer and prosecutor in Massachusetts before
being elected lieutenant governor in 1982. He was elected to the
Senate two years later, and was unopposed when he ran for a fourth
term in November.</TE>
<TE>   In the Senate, he helped lead the investigation into the
Iran-Contra affair -- in which money from secret U.S. arms sales to
Iran in the early 1980s went to support rebels in Nicaragua in
violation of congressional limitations -- and helped expose scandals
at the Abu Dhabi-based Bank of Credit and Commerce International,
which closed in 1991 after it was linked to secret weapon deals, drug
money and terrorists.</TE>
<TE>   Kerry has been a vocal critic of President Bush's policy against
Iraq, urging that Bush first go to the United Nations. Kerry
eventually voted for the congressional resolution supporting U.S.
action against Baghdad. He voted against the Gulf War in 1991. He has
been sharply critical of Bush's Middle East policy, repeating on
Sunday that the administration had disengaged from that area of the
world during its first year in office. He also opposes Bush's tax
cuts, saying they favor the rich.</TE>
<TE>   "As people get to know me in the course of this, they'll know the
things that I have fought for and the things I stand for," Kerry said
on NBC.</TE>
<TE>   One of the biggest hurdles for Kerry is whether he can
successfully overcome questions that he is a New England liberal who
cannot connect with the rest of the country. While studies have shown
that he has voted with Sen. Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.) -- one of the
Senate's best-known liberals -- 93% of the time, Kerry also has taken
more conservative positions on issues such as education reform, where
he opposes tenure for teachers.</TE>
<TE>   He portrayed himself Sunday as a tough former prosecutor with
combat experience. He is married to Teresa Heinz -- whose first
husband was Sen. John Heinz (R-Pa.), the heir to the Heinz food
fortune who died in 1991 -- and has two daughters.</TE>

<HD>Students Get Even on Mascot Issue</HD>
<DH>At least $100,000 for scholarships is raised for Native
American college students in Colorado.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>DENVER</DL>
<LD>What started out as an attempt to shame a local high school into
dropping a mascot name viewed as racist has raised at least $100,000
for scholarships for American Indian college students.</LD>
<LD>   The effort began last winter when a group of Native American
students at the University of Northern Colorado asked officials at
nearby Eaton High School to change the school's mascot from "Fighting
Reds" because the name was offensive.</LD>
<LD>   When the school refused, members of the UNC intramural basketball
team, made up of American Indians and whites, decided to get even.</LD>
<TE>   They named themselves the "Fightin' Whites" and began wearing
T-shirts bearing the name. After getting national media attention
they began selling the shirts, which bear the slogan, "Everythang's
going to be all white," from their Web site.</TE>
<TE>   More than 15,000 shirts and hats have been sold, raising at least
$100,000.</TE>
<TE>   "It's actually kind of an amazing thing that happened there in
Colorado. Not only did they raise the level of debate but they also
turned it around and raised money for Native American scholarships,"
said Charlene Teters, vice president of the American Indian
Movement's National Coalition on Race in Sports and Media.</TE>
<TE>   "There have been posters before that made fun of teams, but
nothing has been this successful," said Teters, a member of the
Spokane Nation.</TE>
<TE>   Jeff VanIwarden, a team member who helped manage the T-shirt
campaign, said the amount of money available for scholarships will
depend on whether an application for tax-exempt status is accepted.</TE>
<TE>   A $10,000 endowment has already been set up for one scholarship at
the University of Northern Colorado starting next year.</TE>

<SE></SE>
<AU>Ronald Brownstein</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It's difficult to say who has more nerve: state officials pushing
Washington to rescue them from a budget crisis significantly of their
own making, or federal officials pushing states to shoulder the costs
of the federal education reform law that President Bush and so many
congressional candidates touted in last month's election.</LD>
<LD>   Both sides are refusing to face the mismatch between their goals
and resources. Both want voters to believe they can simultaneously
cut taxes and maintain popular services.</LD>
<LD>   In Washington and the state capitals, the underlying problem is
the same: Mounting spending needs and the end of the boom years have
made the tax cuts adopted since the late 1990s unsustainable. Yet
neither Bush nor most governors want to admit that. So, whenever
possible, each is trying to shift costs onto the other.</LD>
<TE>   Everyone is passing the buck because no one wants to raise one.</TE>
<TE>   Start with the states. Last week, the National Governors Assn.
warned that this may be the toughest year for state budgets since
World War II. The governors predicted "draconian" cuts in the months
ahead, especially in health care for the poor -- an alarming
prospect, as the number of Americans without health insurance is
rising again.</TE>
<TE>   The economic slowdown, exploding health-care costs and the
aftermath of last year's terrorist attacks have all contributed to
the budget mess. But the states are hardly blameless.</TE>
<TE>   Spending is part of the problem. In some instances, states
cemented large spending increases while revenue was rising in the
late 1990s. But Ray Scheppach, executive director of the governors
group, says that from 1995 through 2000, overall state spending
increased 6.5% annually -- about the same as over the previous two
decades. And states nearly tripled budget reserves during the fat
years.</TE>
<TE>   The more fundamental change came on the tax side. From 1994
through 2001, 43 states enacted major tax cuts. In an eye-opening
study last month, Nicholas Johnson, director of the state fiscal
project at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, calculated
that those tax cuts are costing states $40 billion in lost revenue
every year.</TE>
<TE>   That's equal to three-fifths of the $67-billion deficit the
National Conference of State Legislatures says the states are facing
in the current budget year, which suggests that many states are
taking on water now partly because they cut such big holes in their
own boats.</TE>
<TE>   Another revealing fact from Johnson's study reinforces that
conclusion. He compared the budget deficits this year in the 10
states that enacted the deepest tax cuts in the 1990s with the 10
that cut taxes the least. Those in the first group included New York,
New Jersey and Michigan; the second group included Nevada, New
Hampshire, and Tennessee.</TE>
<TE>   Today, the more aggressive tax-cutting states are drowning in red
ink: They face budget deficits for the upcoming budget year equal to
a daunting 13% of state spending. Meanwhile, the states that cut
taxes modestly in the 1990s are anticipating deficits equal to just
1% of spending.</TE>
<TE>   As they struggle with their deficits, states can make strong
claims for several kinds of help from Washington. Homeland security
is a national responsibility, and Washington should provide states
with more dollars to respond to attacks. And the health-care system
is descending into such crisis that it's clearly in the national
interest to provide states more dollars to cover the uninsured.</TE>
<TE>   But it's difficult to see why Washington, struggling with deficits
itself, should bail out state officials who won't take the tough step
of reconsidering the tax cuts that have contributed to their budget
woes. Governors and legislators bought themselves popularity in the
late 1990s with extravagant tax reductions; Washington has no
obligation to spare them the consequences of those decisions.</TE>
<TE>   Parents do no good by writing a check when their kids' credit card
debts get too big because they virtually guarantee a repeat; the same
analogy applies here. Even if Washington extends the states a
lifeline today, more crack-ups are almost inevitable unless states
restore a level of taxation sufficient to fund the health-care,
education and homeland security services their residents expect. "The
question is: Can states continue to meet the cost of governing over
the long term with the current revenue structure?" says Johnson. "I
think the answer is no."</TE>
<TE>   The same question could be asked of the federal government after
the $1.35-trillion, 10-year tax cut Bush pushed through Congress last
year. One small, but telling, example last week suggests the answer
in that case is also no.</TE>
<TE>   Bush's Education Department took a welcome step by announcing
tough regulations meant to ensure that states and cities comply with
the goals in last year's education reform bill.</TE>
<TE>   To put it charitably, local educators have been unenthusiastic
about many of the bill's key provisions. In particular, most
districts have virtually ignored the requirement that they let
students from under-performing schools transfer to better public
schools.</TE>
<TE>   In the regulations, the Education Department admirably stripped
away one of the districts' major excuses: It said a district can't
refuse transfers by arguing that it lacks space in better schools.
But when asked what cities with legitimate space shortages (like Los
Angeles) should do, the department breezily advised them to build
more schools and hire more teachers.</TE>
<TE>   This from an administration that wants to eliminate the
$1.2-billion federal program to help subsidize school construction
and freeze federal aid for hiring more teachers. The truth is that
even if Bush wanted to help, he could only respond to these needs by
diverting taxes collected for Social Security because the rest of the
federal budget -- under the weight of war on terrorism, recession and
his tax cut -- is looking at big deficits for at least the next
decade.</TE>
<TE>   The same problem makes it difficult for Bush to do more than
gesture at the rising number of Americans without health insurance.
And it makes Social Security reform a lost cause even if the two
parties could agree on a plan. From Sacramento to Albany to
Pennsylvania Avenue, the costs of the nation's exorbitant tax-cutting
binge are growing more difficult to ignore.</TE>

<HD>Georgia's New GOP Takes Root</HD>
<DH>The first Republican governor-elect in 130 years greets
supporters in rural part of state.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>PERRY, Ga.</DL>
<LD>The crowds usually come to the fairground exhibition hall for trade
shows or to get a peek at the fancy horses. But on display here
Sunday was the new face of Georgia politics.</LD>
<LD>   Nearly a month after a staggering electoral upset by Georgia
Republicans, hundreds of them flocked to the Georgia National
Fairgrounds and Agricenter to greet Sonny Perdue, who is about to
become the first GOP governor here in 130 years. The occasion was a
pre-inauguration event called "Celebrating a New Georgia," Perdue's
only big official appearance before taking office Jan. 13.</LD>
<LD>   His supporters still seemed incredulous that they had rewritten
political history: Before Perdue's victory, Georgia had remained the
one spot in the South where Democrats were unvanquished. Among those
expressing surprise was Perdue, who owns a grain and fertilizer
business in neighboring Bonaire.</LD>
<TE>   "It's amazing what happened ... as we asked the people of Georgia
to make democracy work," Perdue told a crowd that organizers said
numbered about 2,000. A sign on the dais proclaimed this "Perdue
Country."</TE>
<TE>   Those attending the rally included farmers, schoolteachers,
businessmen and retirees -- most of them from this agricultural belt
in the state's midsection, about 100 miles south of Atlanta. Many
have known Perdue for years, either through his business or politics.
Until last year, Perdue represented the area in the state Senate,
first as a Democrat. He switched parties in 1998.</TE>
<TE>   Sunday's celebration was rich with pride for a hometown boy made
good. (Perdue is hardly the first. Former Sen. Sam Nunn, a Democrat,
is from Perry -- a onetime Democratic stronghold that is growing
increasingly Republican.)</TE>
<TE>   "Sonny Perdue is a man of tremendous character," said Brian
Powers, a 66-year-old instructor pilot who has flown with Perdue,
also a pilot.</TE>
<TE>   The fairground gathering underscored Perdue's roots in rural
Georgia, which hadn't produced a governor in nearly three decades.</TE>
<TE>   "Not only did we elect a Republican for the first time in 130
years, we elected a rural Georgian for the first time since Jimmy
Carter," said Alec Poitevint, who chaired Perdue's campaign and is a
member of the transition team.</TE>
<TE>   Perdue's victory owed much to white rural voters, who supported
him heavily over the Democratic incumbent, Roy Barnes. Barnes
captured counties around the state's largest cities -- such as
Atlanta, Columbus, Augusta, Savannah and Macon. But Perdue won just
about everywhere else, finishing with a six percentage-point edge
statewide and adding Georgia to the ranks of Southern states with GOP
governors.</TE>
<TE>   Besides offering Perdue a chance to thank supporters, Sunday's
event in Perry also carried a political message. "The symbolism is,
he's not from Atlanta and he's not going to be responsive exclusively
to Atlanta's concerns," said Charles Bullock, a political science
professor at the University of Georgia. "A problem Roy Barnes faced
was that he was seen as concentrating too much power in Atlanta."</TE>
<TE>   Georgia often has been described as really two states:
metropolitan Atlanta and everywhere else. Rural Georgia once held
sway in state politics, going back to the days of Gov. Eugene
Talmadge -- who in the 1930s was a champion for Georgia's small-town
farming ways before his rhetoric became better known for its racism.</TE>
<TE>   After the 1950s, the growth of metropolitan Atlanta, now with
about half the state's residents, and the demise of a county-based
voting system tipped the political balance. The rural southern
portion of the state now accounts for only about a fifth of Georgia
voters.</TE>
<TE>   "We're hoping the rest of the state's going to get a fair shake"
under Perdue, said Leonard "Bo" Hogan, the GOP chairman in rural
Burke County on the eastern side of the state.</TE>
<TE>   Rural resentment boiled to the surface over Barnes' decision last
year to reduce the Confederate emblem on the state flag without
public debate, a move that enraged supporters of the old banner and
mobilized many on election day. During the campaign, Perdue said he
favored letting voters decide how the flag should look, but he has
said little about it since being elected.</TE>
<TE>   At Sunday's gathering, members of the Sons of Confederate Veterans
handed out lapel stickers bearing the likeness of the former state
flag, which is dominated by the Confederate symbol. Many attendees
stuck them on their jackets. "We want everyone to remember we were
there for him," said A. Jack Bridwell, commander of the group's
Georgia division.</TE>
<TE>   Cementing rural backing for the GOP would represent another stage
in the state's political transformation. That conversion may take
place gradually, but for now, Republican support is likely to remain
rooted in the suburbs, said Michael Binford, who teaches political
science at Georgia State University. "If you're a Republican, the
bulk of your base is going to come from suburban areas," he said.</TE>
<TE>   It is over suburban swing voters that Democrats are girding for
the next battle. Republicans "can have all the rallies they want in
the countryside," said Jim Coonan, who advises Democratic candidates
for local and state legislative offices. "In the long run, they're
going to have to get better schools and better health care, drinkable
water and cleaner air, or they won't get these swing voters."</TE>

<HD>Wisconsin Hunters Not Deterred by Chronic Wasting Disease
Fears</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WAUSAU, Wis.</DL>
<LD>Tradition appeared to be stronger than fear for most deer hunters in
Wisconsin, a state trying to determine how far chronic wasting
disease has spread among its herd.</LD>
<LD>   Heartened by a lack of evidence that the always-fatal disease can
infect humans, something close to the usual contingent of hunters
took part in the first deer season since the disease was discovered
in the southwestern part of the state. Most even told state officials
they wanted to keep the venison.</LD>
<LD>   "We are seeing some proof of what we felt all along, that deer
hunting is a strongly held tradition and people don't want to give it
up easily or willingly," said Bob Manwell, a spokesman for the state
Department of Natural Resources.</LD>
<TE>   License sales dropped 10% for the state's nine-day deer season,
which ended Sunday, and the 121,000 deer that hunters registered over
the first weekend represented a 20% drop from last year. But that was
a better showing than game managers had feared, given preseason
surveys indicating a third of hunters would stay home.</TE>
<TE>   The final numbers on how many deer were killed were not expected
until Tuesday.</TE>

<HD>The Glue That Broke Flying Dinosaur's Back</HD>
<DH>Once hailed as a missing link, forgery is found to be
mosaic of fossils from Microraptor and a bird.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Robert Lee Hotz</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>When the smuggled stone slab first surfaced at a Tucson mineral show,
it seemed the likely key to a mystery of evolution.</LD>
<LD>   To the collector who paid $80,000 for it, the Chinese fossil had
every appearance of a feathered dinosaur that flew like a modern
bird. The purported missing link made headlines when National
Geographic trumpeted the find in 1999, then caused red faces when it
was revealed as a forgery a year later.</LD>
<LD>   Researchers in China and at the American Museum of Natural History
in New York now have completely deciphered the deception.</LD>
<TE>   The find wrongly hailed as a crucial link between the dinosaurs
and the birds actually does contain fossils of a dinosaur and a bird.
But the only connection between them is glue.</TE>
<TE>   In a study published recently in the journal Nature, the
researchers revealed that the major part of the doctored fossil
belongs to an ancient, fish-eating bird called Yanornis martini. Its
lizard-like tail belongs to a small, carnivorous dinosaur previously
identified as Microraptor zhaoianus. Both creatures lived and died
more than 110 million years ago.</TE>
<TE>   The scandal over the Archaeoraptor fossil, as the forgery was
named, highlights the problem of illegal traffic in specimens from
one of the world's most important fossil beds in China -- and the
simmering tensions between amateur collectors and the scientists who
covet such bones.</TE>
<TE>   "The controversy over the forged Archaeoraptor is an alarm to all
paleontologists," said Zhonghe Zhou at Beijing's Institute of
Vertebrate Paleontology and Paleoanthropology, who led the research
team that identified the Yanornis bones. "First, we had better not
buy and study illegally exported specimens; second, something can
indeed be too good to be true."</TE>
<TE>   Working with Julia A. Clarke at the American Museum of Natural
History, Zhou compared the front half of the forged fossil with the
only two known specimens of the long-extinct bird. The researchers
compared more than 200 features to pinpoint the creature's true
identity.</TE>
<TE>   "We've presented the missing piece to the puzzle," said Clarke,
who specializes in studying the relationships between fossils. "It
really looks like Yanornis. That combination is unique."</TE>
<TE>   Suspicions about these bones of contention were first confirmed
when X-ray analysis revealed that the fossil was a mosaic made from
88 fragments of rock and fossil leaved together in three layers and
glued to a single supporting slab of shale. Grout had been used to
fill any gaps.</TE>
<TE>   As best as anyone can tell, the fossils had been unearthed in an
illegal dig in northern China in 1997 at one of the most spectacular
fossil beds of modern paleontology. The deposits of volcanic and
sedimentary rock in Liaoning province have yielded a trove of
unusually well-preserved fossils of feathered dinosaurs.</TE>
<TE>   So far, there has been no suggestion that anyone forged the fossil
as a hoax to deliberately mislead scientists, as was the case with
the infamous Piltdown Man.</TE>
<TE>   In that 1912 incident, a researcher deliberately altered a set of
human and orangutan bones to make them seem to be remains from the
same creature, then buried them in an English quarry. When they were
dug up, they were hailed as a missing link between ape and modern
mankind. The hoax distorted scientific ideas on the descent of man
for almost 40 years.</TE>
<TE>   In the same way, the discovery of the Archaeoraptor forgery was a
twist in a scientific dispute over the origin of birds.</TE>
<TE>   Publicity compounded the problem, turning the volatile mix of
paleontology and profit into something more toxic to sound science.
The popular press had embraced a specimen that seemed almost too good
to be true, without waiting for formal scientific confirmation,
several researchers said.</TE>
<TE>   When the fossil find was made public, it did help buttress the
argument that birds are the direct descendants of carnivorous
Theropod dinosaurs such as Tyrannosaurus rex.</TE>
<TE>   When it was revealed as a fake, however, it then served to
discredit the theory by calling into doubt the veracity of other
fossils from China that document the link between dinosaurs and
modern birds. Moreover, the fraud was exploited by religious
fundamentalists eager to undermine any evidence of evolution.</TE>
<TE>   "Scientifically, it was a bump," said Philip Currie, curator of
dinosaurs at the Royal Tyrrell Museum in Drumheller, Canada. "There
were a lot of uncomfortable feelings and a lot of accusations kicked
around."</TE>
<TE>   In this case, experts are confident that nothing more than the
profit motive was at work.</TE>
<TE>   Several scientists suspect that a local farmer glued the fragments
together simply to create a more presentable -- and potentially more
lucrative -- specimen for the thriving black market in fossils.
Chinese authorities have struggled in vain for years to control the
region's illegal traffic in fossils.</TE>
<TE>   "It was not a hoax, just poor judgment," said Kevin Padian, an
expert on avian evolution at the University of California Museum of
Paleontology in Berkeley.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think for a minute the villagers were trying to fool
anyone. They are not scientists. They see that a nice specimen
fetches more money. If they enhance it a bit, it just looks better."</TE>
<TE>   Other Chinese fossils of down-covered dinosaurs soon were
discovered, however, that filled the evolutionary gap that
Archaeoraptor had pretended to bridge.</TE>
<TE>   As for the fossil fragments that went into the $80,000 forgery,
they have been returned to China, where researchers now estimate
their value at $1 million.</TE>

<LD>Rome, one of the West's oldest cities, and Los Angeles, one of its
youngest major cities, share a lost opportunity. Neither has
capitalized on the enormous potential of the rivers that run through
them, but both now realize that reconnecting their rivers and cities
can bring enormous benefits. Other great cities, such as Paris,
London, Shanghai and Boston, use their rivers as central features to
organize their urban space and promote civic life.</LD>
<LD>   Rome and Los Angeles share another condition; each is subject to
occasional but devastating floods. Rome channeled the Tiber in the
1870s. In 1930, the Olmsted brothers and Bartholomew Associates
mapped out 200 miles of parkways and boulevards along the Los Angeles
River. However, a major flood in 1938 wiped out this vision and
instead caused planners to realign the river and construct the ugly
concrete flood channel that we see today.</LD>
<LD>   Earlier this year, I was in Rome doing independent study as a
fellow at the American Academy. As I have long espoused a "greenway
concept" for Los Angeles that uses the L.A. River as a key corridor,
I studied the Tiber River because there are numerous parallels. Many
of the strategies that I recommended for the Tiber are equally
applicable here.</LD>
<TE>   * Link the river to a regional open space network that ties
together existing parks, natural reserves, plazas and gardens. The
network should also utilize rights of way, including rail and power
line easements, river tributaries and the river itself.</TE>
<TE>   * Focus attention and resources on areas in which we can make the
biggest difference.</TE>
<TE>   In Rome, there are three bends in the river that played a critical
role in the city's history; these became my prime focus. Los Angeles
needs to identify its key locations. These include not only historic
sites but also available land adjacent to and accessible from central
city neighborhoods in need of recreational space. One such site is
along the Long Beach Freeway north of where the Rio Hondo joins the
Los Angeles River.</TE>
<TE>   * Identify potential sites along the river where new public and
private development can occur. Here, we have already begun with plans
for state parks at two locations near downtown: Taylor Yard and the
Cornfield.</TE>
<TE>   Additionally, cultural and housing developments are naturals that
could sit on terraces overlooking the river. Among my study's visions
for sites along the Tiber in Rome are a new opera house, convention
center, hotel complex, marina and parks.</TE>
<TE>   * Develop a system of bike and walking paths that follows the
banks of the river. Bike pathways already exist along portions of the
Tiber embankment. In Los Angeles, we could use the service road along
the embankment to connect existing bikeways.</TE>
<TE>   * Preserve and restore the natural habitat along the river. Within
Rome's downtown, the river is mostly walled, but the riverbed is
natural earth. Native trees and riparian growth are found in
riverside parks just outside the core area.</TE>
<TE>   The Tiber is one of the only continuous "natural" landscaped
features within Rome, a city known for its hard-surfaced plazas. In
L.A., natural habitats can be found in the Whittier Narrows and
Sepulveda Basin, but others could be created at places like Taylor
Yard.</TE>
<TE>   * Improve the quality of the river water by capturing the trash
that runs to the ocean during rainstorms and by establishing better
river management to stop polluters. Water quality is central to the
futures of both rivers as recreational resources.</TE>
<TE>   Naturally, we still must make provision for flood protection.
Wholesale removal of the flood walls in both cities is impossible
without a major change to water flows. In Rome we recommended that
some flood walls be reduced by as much as seven feet while still
maintaining flood protection.</TE>
<TE>   Tempering or reconfiguring the flood walls in Los Angeles is also
important if we are to "naturalize" the river course. A large
percentage of Angelenos come from cultures with long-standing
traditions of active use of public open space -- the promenade, the
square and the park. Only 4% of Los Angeles' surface area is devoted
to parks, compared with Boston and San Francisco, more than 9% each;
Seattle, 13%; and New York, 17%.</TE>
<TE>   The Friends of the Los Angeles River are working to call attention
to our city's most underused resource. The City Council has formed a
committee to create a master plan for the revitalization of the
river. This is exciting progress.</TE>
<TE>   It may take us 100 years to recapture our river and make it the
heart of the city. Rome is just getting started after 2,800 years.</TE>

<HD>Democrats Might Need to Look South</HD>
<DH>To unseat Bush in wartime calls for a special candidate.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>John J. Pitney Jr.</AU>
<BD>John J. Pitney Jr. is a professor of government at
Claremont McKenna College and author of "The Art of Political
Warfare" (University of Oklahoma Press, 2000).</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Though the 2002 midterm election is barely over, the 2004
presidential campaign has already started.</LD>
<LD>   Sen. John Kerry (D-Mass.) is getting ready to file a declaration
of candidacy. Sen. John Edwards (D-N.C.) informally launched his own
campaign with a far-ranging policy speech. Other potential
challengers are polishing their sound bites and planning trips to New
Hampshire.</LD>
<LD>   But before having their staffs find lyrics to "Hail to the Chief,"
would-be candidates should take a deep breath. History suggests that
the eventual Democratic nominee will have a tough time ousting the
incumbent. Whatever may happen in Iraq, President Bush is already a
wartime commander in chief.</LD>
<TE>   Like the Cold War, the war on terror is a protracted conflict
combining secret combat with periods of open bloodshed. If the
politics of this war follow the same course, then Republicans will
have an edge.</TE>
<TE>   During the 11 presidential elections of the Cold War (1948 to
1988), GOP candidates averaged 52.6% of the two-party vote, compared
with 47.4% for the Democrats.</TE>
<TE>   Other topics also affected these elections, but the issue of
national security usually helped GOP presidential candidates. Voters
preferred Republican toughness to Democratic diplomacy.</TE>
<TE>   After the Cold War, the percentages reversed themselves. In the
three presidential races between 1992 and 2000, Democrats averaged
52.8% to the Republicans' 47.2%. The GOP still owned the national
security issue, but in the decade of "the economy, stupid," defense
was a political penny stock. The Democrats' favorite domestic issues
were more decisive.</TE>
<TE>   In peacetime, the commander in chief had become the comforter in
chief. Peacetime ended on Sept. 11, 2001.</TE>
<TE>   Americans again are focusing on the military issues, where
Republicans are strong. President Bush's high approval ratings
suggest that the GOP is regaining the presidential advantage it held
before the senior Bush's 1992 defeat.</TE>
<TE>   Democrats could still win if they run the right kind of candidate.
And six decades of election returns indicate that such a candidate
would be a Southerner. The last Democratic winner from outside the
South was John F. Kennedy in 1960. And like Harry Truman in 1948, JFK
failed to win an absolute majority of the total popular vote. The
last Northern Democrat to do so was Franklin Roosevelt in 1944.</TE>
<TE>   Why? First, particularly since the 1960s, Republicans have built
an electoral stronghold in the South. The Democrats who have had the
greatest success at cracking that stronghold -- Lyndon Johnson, Jimmy
Carter and Bill Clinton -- have all been Southerners.</TE>
<TE>   Second, voters tend to link Northern Democrats with a certain
softness on military issues. Think of the silly 1988 photo of Michael
Dukakis on a tank in a Snoopy helmet.</TE>
<TE>   So if a Southern pedigree is a condition of success, the current
Democratic field narrows down to Edwards and former Vice President Al
Gore. This choice should not fill Democrats with optimism. Edwards is
a first-term senator with no national security credentials. True,
Bush had none before his election, but 2000 was a peacetime race.</TE>
<TE>   That leaves Gore -- and another sobering historical datum. Though
he did win a small plurality of the 2000 popular vote, Gore is the
only Southern Democrat in the party's history to lose every state of
the old Confederacy. And he has not become more popular in the
region.</TE>
<TE>   There is no ironclad guarantee of a Republican victory in 2004.
Any number of events could erase the GOP margin: a major scandal, a
triple-dip recession or a catastrophic setback in the war on
terrorism. But if Republicans escape these problems and the war on
terrorism goes well, it is hard to see how they can lose the White
House.</TE>
<TE>   Still, many Democrats insist they can beat history by running a
Northern progressive who can mobilize their liberal base. That
strategy recently worked on TV's "The West Wing," in which incumbent
President Jed Bartlet triumphed over his Bush-like Republican
opponent.</TE>
<TE>   Things are a bit different in the real world, however.</TE>

<HD>The Highest Patriotism Lies in Weaning U.S. From Fossil
Fuels</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Robert Redford</AU>
<BD>Robert Redford, the actor and director, began his
involvement with solar power issues in the mid-1970s and is a
supporter of the San Francisco-based Vote Solar organization and its
agenda.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Bush White House talks tough on military matters in the Middle
East while remaining virtually silent about the long-term problem
posed by U.S. dependence on fossil fuels. Failing to rein in our
dependence on imported oil gives leverage to undemocratic and
unstable regimes.</LD>
<LD>   Wasteful consumption of fossil fuels creates political liabilities
overseas, air pollution at home and global warming. The rate at which
the United States burns fossil fuels has made our country a leading
contributor to global warming.</LD>
<LD>   The Bush administration's energy policy to date -- a military
garrison in the Middle East and drilling for more oil in the Arctic
and other fragile habitats -- is costly, dangerous and self-
defeating.</LD>
<TE>   Despite the absence of leadership on energy security in
Washington, some local efforts are paying off. Last year, San
Francisco voters overwhelmingly approved a $100-million bond
initiative to pay for solar panels, wind power and energy efficiency
for public buildings. The measure was supported not only by the
environmental community but also by the Chamber of Commerce, labor
unions and the American Lung Assn.</TE>
<TE>   San Francisco's first solar project, a $5.2-million energy-
efficiency upgrade at the Moscone Convention Center, was dedicated
last month. What's the straight economic benefit of this particular
project? Plenty. The upgrades and the panels combined will cut energy
consumption in the building by as much as 38%, and the project will
pay for itself from energy savings. The net savings to taxpayers
after debt service is subtracted are projected to be more than
$200,000 a year.</TE>
<TE>   American rooftops can be the Persian Gulf of solar energy. After
Australia, no developed nation on Earth gets more annual sunlight
than the United States. In addition, wind is now the fastest-growing
energy source worldwide and one of the cheapest. But wind and solar
power generate less than 2% of U.S. power. We can do better.</TE>
<TE>   We can increase auto fuel economy standards to 40 miles per
gallon. The technology to achieve that goal exists now. Phasing in
that standard by 2012 would save 15 times more oil than Alaska's
Arctic National Wildlife Refuge is likely to produce over 50 years.
We could also give tax rebates for existing hybrid gas-electric
vehicles that get as much as 60 mpg and invest in mass transit.</TE>
<TE>   These measures would keep energy dollars in the American economy,
reduce air pollution and create jobs at home.</TE>
<TE>   The benefits of switching to a mostly pollution-free economy would
be considerable, and the costs of failing to do so would be steep.
Prolonging our dependence on fossil fuels would guarantee homeland
insecurity. If you are worried about getting oil from an unstable
Persian Gulf, consider the alternatives: Indonesia, Nigeria,
Uzbekistan.</TE>
<TE>   If we want energy security, then we have to reduce our appetite
for fossil fuels. There's no other way. Other issues may crowd the
headlines, but this is our fundamental challenge.</TE>
<TE>   Big challenges require bold action and leadership. To get the
United States off fossil fuels in this uneasy national climate of
terrorism and conflict in the Persian Gulf, we must treat the issue
with the urgency and persistence it deserves. The measure of our
success will be the condition in which we leave the world for the
next generation.</TE>
<TE>   Weaning our nation from fossil fuels should be understood as the
most patriotic policy to which we can commit ourselves.</TE>

<HD>Pro-Choice at Expense of Free Speech</HD>
<DH>NOW case against abortion protester may backfire.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jonathan Turley</AU>
<BD>Jonathan Turley teaches constitutional law at George
Washington University.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In 1986, two alleged racketeers were hauled into federal courts in
New York and Chicago. One was John Gotti, the head of the murderous
Gambino crime family. The other was Joseph Scheidler, a former
Benedictine monk and pro-life protester. Only one was found liable as
a racketeer: the former monk.</LD>
<LD>   Scheidler was found guilty under the civil provisions of the
Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, a law designed to
combat organized crime. His case, Scheidler vs. the National
Organization for Women, will be heard Wednesday before the U.S.
Supreme Court in what may be the most important case of its term. It
is a case that could radically alter the exercise of free speech in
this country in a way that the framers could never have anticipated.</LD>
<LD>   The case stems from protests that occurred more than 16 years ago.
Scheidler, who marched at Selma, Ala., with Martin Luther King Jr.,
helped organize groups in nonviolent demonstrations and sit-ins
modeled on the civil rights movement.</LD>
<TE>   In 1986, Scheidler was arrested after he and three ministers
walked into a clinic to announce their intention to demonstrate the
following day. He was later found guilty of second-degree trespass,
though the judge reportedly commended him for his commitment to
nonviolence.</TE>
<TE>   Pro-life and pro-choice advocates appear to have one thing in
common: They demonize their opponents in order to justify any means
to combat their influence.</TE>
<TE>   NOW hit Scheidler with an array of federal civil charges under the
RICO law as well as bizarre antitrust allegations. A federal judge in
Chicago dismissed their claims, but the U.S. Supreme Court in 1994
reinstated the case. At the time, however, some justices expressed
concern about the implications of NOW's use of RICO on the exercise
of free speech.</TE>
<TE>   Since trespass is not a crime that can support a RICO charge, NOW
relied on a novel definition of extortion to cover protests. Under
common law, extortion is defined as "obtaining" property by threats
or violence. NOW argued, and the federal court agreed, that it could
stretch this definition to include protests where clinic owners and
patients were deterred or harassed in their use of clinics. It
worked; Scheidler is now appealing the order to pay $258,000 in
treble damages.</TE>
<TE>   Although this lawsuit alleged that pro-lifers used dangerous and
reckless means to advance their goals, NOW can be accused of the same
lack of judgment. If successful, NOW would create a tool that could
be used against any number of public interest groups.</TE>
<TE>   Under NOW's sweeping definition, King could have been charged as a
racketeer in some protests. Storeowners in Selma and Montgomery, for
example, could have claimed that sit-ins, boycotts and protests
deprived them of business by intimidating customers and employees.
Even with King's commitment to nonviolence, some protests resulted in
sporadic violent clashes, often caused by the police.</TE>
<TE>   For this reason, public interest groups have vehemently opposed
NOW's effort before the Supreme Court. Groups like People for the
Ethical Treatment of Animals and Greenpeace could easily fit NOW's
new definition of racketeers.</TE>
<TE>   If the court rules in NOW's favor, it could unleash a torrent of
litigation against such groups by businesses and others.</TE>
<TE>   None of this means that NOW was not right to pursue Scheidler or
other protesters. To the contrary, where they have trespassed, they
should be prosecuted. Where physical intimidation is used, assault
charges should be brought.</TE>
<TE>   Ironically, though, the kind of unhinged individuals whom NOW most
wants to deter are unlikely to be swayed by the use of civil RICO. It
is legitimate protest groups that would be most affected by this new
threat to free speech.</TE>
<TE>   The framers could not have anticipated this threat when they
sought to protect free speech from the government. By using a law
designed to gut criminal organizations through treble damages,
private groups could pose a far greater barrier to free speech. It is
the ultimate weapon for the incautious to use against the
overzealous.</TE>
<TE>   With this case, NOW has assumed the role of a Captain Ahab on a
blind pursuit of a whale named Scheidler. The danger is that NOW may
find itself lashed to the side of this whale, descending into the
abyss with the very object of its obsession.</TE>

<HD>Grand Canyon Outrage</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When federal officials proposed building a dam within the Grand
Canyon 40 years ago, the Sierra Club and other environmentalists
responded with outrage. Why not flood the Sistine Chapel, the club
said, for a better view of Michelangelo's frescoes?</LD>
<LD>   That was maybe a bit of a stretch, but it's time to bring out the
hyperbole again. Peabody Western Coal, the nation's largest coal
mining company, proposes to sink a 1,200-foot shaft into a branch of
the Grand Canyon to suck water from the Colorado River. The
$125-million scheme would include a pumping plant within the park to
send the water to a slurry pipeline at a nearby mine.</LD>
<LD>   Drill through the rim of the Grand Canyon to get water from the
drought-stricken Colorado? Why not sink geothermal wells in
Yellowstone or explore for oil in Yosemite Valley?</LD>
<TE>   The National Park Service should condemn this wretched idea
immediately. And Peabody ought to drop it like a hot rock.</TE>
<TE>   The company says the project in Grand Canyon National Park is only
"an option we're looking at." In fact, Sen. Jon Kyl (R-Ariz.) was the
sponsor of legislation that would have enabled Peabody to lease 6,500
acre-feet from the Colorado. That's enough water to serve about
13,000 families a year -- and the Colorado is a chief source of
Southern California's water. The bill luckily didn't make it to a
vote.</TE>
<TE>   Peabody buys about 3,800 acre-feet of well water from the Hopi
tribe to serve its Black Mesa mine, east of Grand Canyon and operated
under lease from the Hopi and Navajo tribes since 1970. Crushed coal
is mixed with the water and piped 137 miles to the Mohave electric
power plant near Laughlin, Nev. The plant, criticized as a major
polluter, serves customers in California, Nevada and Arizona.</TE>
<TE>   The Hopi, concerned about not having enough water, told Peabody
they would quit the deal in 2005. A Navajo official said other
alternatives, including the use of brackish water, were being
pursued. OK. But Peabody should keep out of the Grand Canyon.</TE>
<TE>   The drill hole and pumping station would be miles upstream from
the South Rim, where most visitors congregate. But popularity isn't
the issue. When Congress created Grand Canyon National Park, it meant
for all of the park to be protected. Otherwise, why not just flood
the park so folks could get a closer view from tour boats?</TE>

<LD>The death toll in Kenya last week was comparatively low, and hundreds
of would-be terror victims aboard a commercial jet were spared. But
the resort location, the targeting of Israelis abroad and close
coordination of two attacks gave the world a new fright.</LD>
<LD>   U.S. and Israeli investigators worked through the weekend with
their Kenyan counterparts, looking for answers. Going by what is
publicly known, it could be a long haul to find out who masterminded
Thursday's suicide bombing of an Israeli-owned hotel outside Mombasa
and the shooting of shoulder-launched missiles that brushed past an
Israeli jetliner carrying tourists from the Mombasa airport to Tel
Aviv.</LD>
<LD>   Kenyan police said Sunday that two pieces of metal found in the
debris of the hotel, where three Israeli tourists and 10 Kenyans
died, were fragments of a bomb and contained marks that might be
traceable. Kenyan investigators would profit from letting Israel or
the U.S. use their more sophisticated equipment to analyze the
fragments.</LD>
<TE>   Israeli investigators strongly suspect Al Qaeda, although ''there
is no concrete evidence.'' More is at stake in finding that elusive
evidence than just solving a crime. An Israeli expert called the
twin, closely timed attacks an alarming ''evolution of terrorism.''
Many Soviet-made missiles of the type used in Mombasa are available
on the black market; they have so deteriorated over the years that
many are thought to be worthless, and they require trained operators
to bring down an aircraft. But the two missiles Thursday came close
enough for the captain of the Arkia jet to feel a bump.</TE>
<TE>   As in October's much deadlier Bali nightclub bombing, the attacks
at Mombasa -- an Indian Ocean port known for nearby beaches and
access to wildlife safaris -- will devastate tourism. All of Kenya
and much of the rest of East Africa are likely to be affected.
Terrorists may count as their prime foes the United States or Israel,
but they are willing to cripple other countries as well. Cause enough
havoc, shred an economy, and the result can be a failed state like
Taliban-ruled Afghanistan either unable to keep terrorists out or
willing to give them shelter.</TE>
<TE>   Kenya's is a secular government bedeviled by a radical Islamic
minority. The 1998 U.S. Embassy bombing, which killed hundreds,
mostly Kenyans, did result in arrests and a determination that Al
Qaeda was responsible. After that attack and the virtually
simultaneous bombing of the U.S. Embassy in neighboring Tanzania,
U.S. and other investigators uncovered Al Qaeda cells in Kenya dating
to the early 1990s. The government welcomed new airport X-ray
machines and metal detectors paid for by the United States, but
gaping holes remain in security at ports, borders and airports.</TE>
<TE>   As most of the prosperous nations tighten internal security,
terrorists prove their cowardice by targeting weaker countries. The
need for governments to share intelligence and coordinate
investigators is greater than ever. Understanding the why, how and
who of individual attacks can at least help in understanding how to
stop the next one.</TE>

<LD>There will be nearly 40 new faces when the state Legislature convenes
today to organize itself for its 2003-04 session. That turnover is
term limits at work again. The party lineup is virtually the same,
with Democrats holding big majorities in both houses. However, a
seemingly insignificant tilt in the balance of power will be
magnified in the coming year as the governor and lawmakers struggle
with a $21-billion-plus budget deficit.</LD>
<LD>   Bringing down the brutally large deficit, which amounts to
one-fifth of the total budget, will consume much of the next
legislative session. A tiny increase in GOP power could play a major
role because passage of the budget or any tax increase requires a
two-thirds vote.</LD>
<LD>   Republicans picked up one seat in the Senate, leaving Democrats in
control 25 to 15, and the GOP won at least two Democratic-leaning
seats in the Assembly, with one race still in doubt. If Democrats win
that one, as they claim they will, they will rule 48 to 32.
Therefore, Democrats must attract at least two GOP votes in the
Senate and six in the Assembly to solve budget issues. The numbers
last year were one and four.</LD>
<TE>   Here's one key loss: Fiscally moderate Republican Sen. Maurice
Johannessen of Redding, who voted with the Democrats and gave the
Senate its two-thirds vote on the budget last year, was termed out,
and there are no more Republicans like him.</TE>
<TE>   There already are warnings of deadlock. Democrats say the budget
can't be solved without some temporary new taxes. That's true, unless
the Legislature is ready to gut programs including public health and
environmental protection. But Republicans continue to chant, "No new
taxes."</TE>
<TE>   The 32 new members in the Assembly and seven in the Senate won't
have a honeymoon in which to bone up on how the Legislature operates.</TE>
<TE>   Normally, the lawmakers convene in December for a day or two of
organizational activity and then go home until January. But Gov. Gray
Davis is calling the Legislature into special session Dec. 9 in an
attempt to pare $5 billion from the current year's budget.</TE>
<TE>   Term limits and redistricting have combined to widen a partisan
ideological gulf. Democrats have drifted further left and Republicans
further right because so-called "safe seats" do away with any need to
appeal across party lines. It is increasingly difficult to reach a
compromise, especially on spending and taxes.</TE>
<TE>   Activists are working against a tide of public opinion in their
efforts to make term limits in California less restrictive and more
like those in other states. But the trial-and-error workings of the
Legislature these days show the need to keep the effort going.</TE>
<TE>   A 12-year limit for members of each house would allow California
to take advantage of the experience and knowledge that lawmakers
build up in their first years in office. Nowadays, especially in the
Assembly, they get the boot right after they learn the job.</TE>

<LD>I am nonplused after reading the story about Gov. Gray Davis ordering
state agencies and departments to freeze or cut spending for
"nonessential" travel, equipment and outside consulting in order to
combat the pending massive state budget deficit ("Davis Fires 1st
Salvo at Deficit," Nov. 27). Perhaps it exposes my naivete about
state agencies and departments, but why are they spending money for
any nonessential activities in the first place? Is there a portion of
the state budget that provides money for "have fun" or "see what you
can think of to do with this"?</LD>

<LD>Re "Mexico, U.S. Agree to Be Patient in Talks," Nov. 27: The
cornerstone of Mexico's economic programs seems to be coercing the
U.S. to act as a sponge for millions of uneducated and unskilled
Mexicans by encouraging them to enter the U.S. illegally -- so as to
relieve internal social pressures. Mexico has made it a foundation of
its economic programs to pressure the U.S. to offer massive social
services to Mexican nationals living here, including illegal aliens.
This includes the issuance of driver's licenses to illegals, the
wider provision of medical, welfare, education and employment
services, as well as granting in-state college tuition rates. Not
content with the foregoing, President Vicente Fox demands amnesty for
all Mexican illegals, increased numbers of legal immigration visas
and massive guest worker programs to solve nonexistent labor
shortages.</LD>
<LD>   It's definitely in American interests to assist Mexico in solving
its migration problems -- but not on American soil. This must happen
in Mexico. A first step in this regard is for the U.S. to seal its
borders. This would force Mexico to face tough decisions and stop
exporting its problems into our backyard.</LD>
<TE>   After World War II, the U.S. poured billions of dollars into the
shattered countries of Europe, with phenomenal success. We should do
something similar with Mexico, but on Mexican soil, not ours. The
Marshall Plan succeeded because it provided the economic impetus for
Europeans to rebuild their countries in Europe -- and not move to the
U.S. looking to become guest workers and U.S. citizens.</TE>

<LD>Re "Kissinger to Lead 9/11 Inquiry," Nov. 28: Henry Kissinger in
charge of the commission investigating intelligence failures leading
to the 9/11 disaster? Isn't this the same man who was called before
Congress on several occasions as a "China expert" but who used every
opportunity to push the interests of the corporations his consulting
business represented there?</LD>
<LD>   Oh well, let bygones be bygones. We can certainly expect a perfect
report this time around from Kissinger; after all, we've been told
many times, by him, that he has never made a mistake and probably
never will.</LD>

<TE>   Kissinger is the perfect choice to lead an inquest into the
terrorist events of Sept. 11, 2001. When he is finished with his
probe, perhaps we could have him investigate the Vietnam War,
Watergate, the invasion of East Timor and the Allende assassination.</TE>
<TE>   Marty Trujillo</TE>
<TE>   Westminster</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   When Kissinger was asked about the CIA-arranged assassination of
Gen. Rene Schneider, the Chilean army's chief of staff, he replied,
"You have to remember what it was like in those days." (Chile had
elected Salvador Allende as president, which was not popular with
corporate America.)</TE>
<TE>   Later, former National Security Advisor John Poindexter was a
defendant in the Iran-Contra scandal, in which he played a lead role.
Talk about poachers turned gamekeepers!</TE>
<TE>   Unfortunately, there is no shortage of CIA members trained in
assassination and paramilitary violence, so the White House can put
all these men to work. Maybe Atty. Gen. John Ashcroft could recruit
some of them to take care of "lefties" in our own country. Did
someone observe that there was a worldwide growth of anti-American
feeling? I wonder why.</TE>

<TE>   Your Nov. 29 editorial ("Kissinger Wrong for the Job")
acknowledges Kissinger as being a "skilled diplomat."</TE>
<TE>   If you have read any of his books, you will gain a picture of his
capacity for research. I foresee Kissinger and his highly skilled
team taking on this challenge as an intellectual pursuit.</TE>
<TE>   The editorial is not wrong in expressing concern over Kissinger's
ability to make an independent inquiry; he has been placed on notice.
Now he should be permitted to do his job unhindered.</TE>

commission's objectives" was meant to lend credence to a
Kissinger-led 9/11 investigation, or as irony.</TE>
<TE>   Sounds like the latter to me, and the appointment of Kissinger
looks to me like a Bush administration in-your-face taunt to America.</TE>

<TE>   The appointment of Kissinger as head of the 9/11 inquiry shows the
people who operate Bush's strings have a sense of humor, however dark
and tortured it may be.</TE>

<LD>Robert Reich's "A Winning $700-Billion Balancing Act" made for
chilling reading. It was the epitome of naked class warfare. Karl
Marx would have been very proud. Reich makes the taking of much of
what's left of one's lifetime efforts to distribute to others sound
almost sensible. "From each according to his abilities; to each
according to his needs." Sound familiar?</LD>
<LD>   Fortunately, we still live in a capitalist society, where we can
work hard all our lives with some assurance that our children will
inherit the fruits of our labors. Reich made me appreciate, more than
ever, why I vote Republican.</LD>
<LD>   Cleo M. Sopp</LD>
<TE>   Whittier</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I see that Reich has come up with the magic elixir to defeat
Republicans: a class-envy tax cut. Boy, that has never been used
before. I will propose a better solution: Pass both the payroll and
estate tax cuts. And remember, no tax cut costs the government a
cent. The government does not earn anything. A tax cut merely allows
working people, whether rich or poor, to keep what they have
rightfully earned.</TE>
<TE>   Bruce A. Campbell</TE>
<TE>   Chino</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   In the unlikely event that the Democrats would adopt Reich's
proposal, they'll need a better slogan than the Republicans', who
undoubtedly would call it "class warfare." One proposal: Bring back
"the Fair Deal."</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Re "Forget Consultants -- the Democrats Need a Speech Therapist,"
Commentary, Nov. 28: For the ever-annoying, omni-patronizing
conservative flack Norah Vincent to lecture the Democrats for their
lecturing tone is only the first illustration of her bent for
postmodern irony. The second is to belittle Al Gore for having
"alienated voters in 2000." Right. He alienated voters into giving
him half a million more popular votes than George W. Bush and falling
short of the presidency by one vote only -- that cast by U.S. Supreme
Court Justice Anthony Kennedy.</LD>
<LD>   Scott Dickerson</LD>
<LD>   Los Alamitos</LD>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Vincent's commentary is more evidence that the right in this
country is not content with stealing a presidential election,
dismantling environmental and consumer protections, trashing the
Constitution and bringing us to the brink of an unnecessary and
potentially disastrous war in Iraq. It must also engage in character
assassination. I don't know whether Gore really thinks that he's
better than everyone else, as Vincent asserts in her vitriolic
screed. But I am reasonably certain from the evidence that he's a far
better person than Vincent herself could ever hope to be.</TE>

<LD>Re "New Security Gets a Stamp of Approval," Nov. 28: The United
States will never even come close to preventing would-be terrorists
from boarding our commercial airliners until we start using common
sense in screening passengers. The little girl pictured being scanned
at LAX is only one of thousands of examples of our misguided,
politically driven aversion to any kind of air-traveler profiling.</LD>
<LD>   I myself have witnessed toddlers younger than this girl and old
people pushed to boarding gates in wheelchairs getting searched right
down to their bare feet, while far more suspicious-looking
passengers, including myself, waltz through unchecked. This isn't
about prejudice. It's about the public welfare. And while I'll
continue to fly, the mostly worthless security procedures now in
place don't make me feel any better about it.</LD>

<HD>Churches Join Effort to Give AIDS Alert</HD>
<DH>Warnings and pleas go out to dozens of local African
American congregations commemorating World AIDS Day.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>In the parking lot of St. Brigid's Catholic Church in South- Central
Los Angeles on Sunday sat a 35-foot trailer from Charles R. Drew
University of Medicine and Science, offering free HIV testing.</LD>
<LD>   Inside the church, Father John Harfmann walked the aisles,
thundering a message of abstinence to a congregation whose members
were handed red ribbons to commemorate World AIDS Day.</LD>
<LD>   "I have anointed people, some priests, some lay people, who have
died of this disease," he said. "It's not a pretty thing to see. When
we wear this [ribbon], it's not just a symbol. It means be aware."</LD>
<TE>   St. Brigid's was one of more than 40 predominantly black churches
in Los Angeles County that commemorated World AIDS Day on Sunday,
some with the message of safe sex, others with abstinence, offering
the victims compassion and mercy.</TE>
<TE>   The African American community has been especially hard hit by the
epidemic of acquired immune deficiency syndrome. According to the Los
Angeles County Department of Health Services, blacks, who make up
9.5% of the county population, account for 20% of the AIDS cases and
34% of the pediatric HIV cases. Nationally, blacks account for 65% of
HIV infection among 13- to 24-year-olds.Inside the Drew medical
trailer, Cynthia Davis, director of the university's HIV Testing and
Outreach Project, said the highest human immunodeficiency virus rate
in her testing is among Hollywood street youth, where it reaches 10%,
and on skid row, where it ranges from 3% to 5%.</TE>
<TE>   She said black women have been especially hard hit by HIV, with a
rate of infection 20 times higher nationally than white women.</TE>
<TE>   Davis expected to test 20 people in the six hours the trailer
would be parked at St. Brigid's. "That's a good day for us," she
said.</TE>
<TE>   Those who are tested must return in a week to get the results.
Only about half are expected to show up, said HIV counselor Madison
Brown.</TE>
<TE>   Though St. Brigid's might still be called a black church, about
30% of its members are Latino, Harfmann said.</TE>
<TE>   Maritza Aguilar, 32, was walking with her two young children on
Western Avenue when she saw the trailer. Although she is married, she
decided to get tested for the first time. "With husbands, you never
know," she said. "Once in a while, it's good to be sure."</TE>
<TE>   Edna Williams heads St. Brigid's HIV/AIDS ministry, which delivers
food, companionship and supplies to AIDS sufferers. After she watched
her son waste away from a robust 6 foot 4, 190 pounds to less than
100 pounds before dying of complications of AIDS in 1993, she knew
she had to do something. Laurence Williams was 32.</TE>
<TE>   "It's my ministry, my mission," she said. "I don't want any mother
to suffer the way I suffered during his illness," she said.</TE>
<TE>   She said that even now, 20 years into the epidemic, AIDS still
carries a tremendous stigma among blacks, many of whom hold the
erroneous belief that the disease can be transmitted through casual
contact.</TE>
<TE>   As a result, they don't want to be tested. "People figure, 'If I
don't know about it, it won't happen to me,' " she said. "It's a
complete reversal of facts."</TE>
<TE>   A few miles south of St. Brigid's, at the First New Christian
Fellowship Missionary Baptist Church, the Rev. Norman S. Johnson
attacked Christians who said AIDS was God's way of punishing gays.
"If God was like that, then why do we have cancer, and tuberculosis
and diabetes?" he asked.</TE>
<TE>   The stereotype of AIDS being a disease of gay white males no
longer holds, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "It can be anyone. In your family. On your job. Among your
friends. Even in the church. Tear down the barriers," he said. "Don't
classify folks according to stereotypes."</TE>

<HD>Choral Group's Voice Continues to Resonate</HD>
<DH>Los Robles Master Chorale, which will celebrate its 25th
anniversary Sunday, will perform in Carnegie Hall in May.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Josef Woodard</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Twenty-five years ago this month, James Stemen led a fledgling choral
group in Handel's venerable "Messiah."</LD>
<LD>   On Sunday, he'll lead the group, now the Los Robles Master
Chorale, as it celebrates its silver anniversary with the same piece.
And in May, the group that started with some good intentions and a
few good voices will play Carnegie Hall.</LD>
<LD>   Sitting in a conference room at Moorpark College before an evening
rehearsal, Stemen shook his head. "I can't believe it's been 25
years. It doesn't feel like it."</LD>
<TE>   The Los Robles saga began with Stemen's desire to tap the
community's talent pool. "I have always wanted to have some kind of a
better choral group than I could get with my daytime college-age
students," said Stemen, a professor at Moorpark since 1969.</TE>
<TE>   First named the Oratorio Chorus, it became the Moorpark
Masterworks Chorale before its present incarnation. The change
reflects the larger geographical spread of its participants and its
audience, Stemen said.</TE>
<TE>   For the silver-anniversary season, the group is stretching its
ambitions. Last month, the chorale performed -- to standing-room only
crowds -- a reprise of Mendelssohn's "Elijah," which it had presented
in a fully staged version in 1994. In the spring, it will perform
Beethoven's Ninth Symphony, along with the Ventura County Master
Chorale, at the invitation of the New West Symphony.</TE>
<TE>   The crowning event of the season will be on May 31, when Los
Robles joins other choral groups from around the country to perform
"Carmina Burana" at Carnegie Hall.</TE>
<TE>   Stemen's concern is raising enough money to bring a large group of
singers to New York. The group has 70 to 90 members at any one time.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to the evening concert there, the group has been asked
to perform a 25-minute solo set that afternoon. Stemen hopes to
showcase music by the group's assistant director, Wilbur Skeels, and
another local composer.</TE>
<TE>   "West meets East," Stemen said. "That's what I'd like to do."</TE>
<TE>   Heading a group like the chorale means juggling creative
responsibilities and economic obligations.</TE>
<TE>   Income from grants, ticket sales, display ads in programs and
other fund-raising goes toward bills, including hiring "good pickup
orchestras," to the tune of $17,000 a night, venue rentals -- which
can be $5,000 for the Kavli Theater in Thousand Oaks -- and other
support costs.</TE>
<TE>   For the singers, though, it's a labor of love.</TE>
<TE>   "Our mission is to perform these great choral works for the
community and to try to be cost-effective when we do it," Stemen
said. "Right now, we are really struggling to meet the bills for this
season."</TE>
<TE>   Stemen grew up in Goshen, Ind. After studying music at Goshen
College, he earned his master's degree at Southern Methodist
University in Texas, where he worked with noted choral director Lloyd
Fautsch.</TE>
<TE>   Two years after Moorpark College opened, he took a teaching job
there. Now divorced, Stemen has two grown children.</TE>
<TE>   Although "people have asked me about retiring, I'm not ready to,"
the 66-year-old Stemen said. "I still have some choral works which I
haven't performed and would like to. I don't know what I'd do if I
retired, anyway."</TE>
<TE>   Skeels has been Stemen's right-hand man for many years.</TE>
<TE>   "[Stemen] is committed to working for a beautiful choral sound,"
Skeels said. "It is a never-ending and somewhat thankless task to
school volunteers in the art of good voice production. But he keeps
at it."</TE>
<TE>   Edith Snyder, who has been a Los Robles singer since 1991, said
Stemen "works hard at giving his group a variety of experiences and
new challenges," including several European tours.</TE>
<TE>   Starting as a singer, Skeels later became the group's accompanist,
assistant director and resident composer. By day, he is pastor of the
First Baptist Church in Ojai and has started a choral publishing
company, Cantus Quercus Press.</TE>
<TE>   On this weekend's program, the Handel centerpiece will be
complemented by several short works by German composer Franz Biebl,
who died at age 95 in 2001. Stemen, Skeels and the choir members had
met Biebl during a concert in Germany.</TE>
<TE>   Los Robles has developed other strong ties in the choral world.
Roger Wagner, whose work with the Los Angeles Master Chorale and the
Roger Wagner Chorale helped popularize choral music, conducted
Stemen's group shortly before his death in 1992.</TE>
<TE>   Other guest conductors have included Britain's Sir David
Willcocks, former L.A. Master Chorale director Paul Salamunovich and
San Francisco Symphony Choral's Vance George.</TE>
<TE>   Los Robles fits into a larger choral scene in Southern California.
It is one of two important choral groups in Ventura County, along
with the Ventura County Master Chorale. To the north, there is the
Santa Barbara Chorale Society, and to the south, the Los Angeles
Master Chorale and the younger Pacific Chorale in Orange County are
professional standard bearers.</TE>
<TE>   That's professional, as in paid. Which is not the case here.</TE>
<TE>   "Ninety-eight percent of my people come to sing for the love of
it," Stemen said.</TE>
<TE>   "When an audience sits there and hears a professional group sing,
they think, 'I know why they're good. They're paid,' " he said. "But
when they sit and hear us ... they just judge us by how well we
sing."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   FYI: Los Robles Master Chorale will perform at 8 p.m. Saturday and
3 p.m. Sunday at Moorpark College Performing Arts Center, 7075 Campus
Road. Tickets are $18 for adults and $6 for children under 12. For
information, call 497-0386.</TE>

<HD>Authorities Rev Down Off-Road Event</HD>
<DH>A large task force controls violence and partying at the
annual Thanksgiving event in Imperial County.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>Special to the Times</BD>
<DL>GLAMIS, Calif.</DL>
<LD>GLAMIS, Calif. -- Drunken crowds that converge on long Thanksgiving
holidays at the Algodones Dunes have been so dangerous and unruly
that law enforcement officials decided this year to respond like they
would to a forest fire.</LD>
<LD>   Ten federal and local agencies assembled 150 officers. They
brought in National Guard jeeps, dune buggies and a helicopter. They
searched for drugs, alcohol and weapons, and set up barricades along
a popular hill that had been the site of raging parties and gruesome
deaths in crashes and shootings.</LD>
<LD>   And it worked, at least compared to what happened last year.</LD>
<TE>   Most importantly, none of the 170,000 duners that met in the
Imperial Sand Dunes Recreation Area this weekend was killed,
something even enthusiasts said can happen because of the sport's
danger or because of the mix of alcohol and young revelers.</TE>
<TE>   Last year over Thanksgiving, two people were killed in separate
crashes, one person was shot to death, and a park ranger suffered
minor injuries when he was run over.</TE>
<TE>   "They're not going to get away with it in our county any longer,
and they have for a long, long time," Imperial County Sheriff's Chief
Deputy Sharon Housouer said Sunday. "We were able to go in, show a
force and shut it down without any really significant incidents
occurring this year."</TE>
<TE>   Twenty-five people were arrested, compared with 70 last year. One
of those arrested for disorderly conduct this year was an off-duty
Los Angeles County sheriff's deputy, Housouer said. About 700
citations were issued, which was less than half last year's number.
About 170 medical emergencies were reported, two requiring air
transport. That was down from 200 last year.</TE>
<TE>   Bob Mason, vice president of the American Sand Assn., an
off-roading organization, and a duner for 40 years, said he was
pleased with the lower numbers but still concerned with the more
dangerous element that has shown up in the last three or four years.
There was a time when fellow duners would help each other in a jam,
he said. Now, if a duner leaves his vehicle in the sand overnight,
someone will set it on fire, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Mason and others pointed out that most of those who attend the
event come only for fun, to camp, race their vehicles within the
rules or drive about the dunes.</TE>
<TE>   Still, officers kept close tabs on large concentrations of people,
especially at night. When 3,000 partyers congregated at Oldsmobile
Hill on Saturday night, officers quickly dispersed them. The crowd
moved about a mile away, where they set bonfires and held a drag
race. They also drove through a fire they had set in a ditch. An hour
later, they were dispersed again.</TE>
<TE>   When the revelers found a third site, officers moved in. Angry
partyers threw sand-filled cans at the officers. But no one was hurt,
Housouer said.</TE>
<TE>   Eric McDonald, a 32-year-old carpenter from Phoenix, who said he
was drunk and planned to drink more, complained that things were much
tamer than last year. "It's just a lot more mellow," he said. "I
think everybody's scared. It takes the thrill in coming out here away
because I come here to watch the idiots."</TE>
<TE>   But all around there was still plenty to see. Fist fights sprang
up between rows of vehicles at Oldsmobile Hill. Spotlights were
pointed at a woman who took her clothes off on top of a makeshift
stage. Someone set a couch on fire.</TE>
<TE>   Then there was the main event, the one officers didn't mind: Dirt
bikers and four-wheel, all-terrain vehicles raced each other up a
280-foot mound of sand, and then back down again. The high-pitched
buzz of their engines nearly drowned out the more throaty roar of
trucks below.</TE>
<TE>   It is, in fact, the drivers of those trucks that law enforcement
said bring most of the chaos. Often, their drivers have nothing to do
with the duning that goes on during the day. At night, they bring in
furniture and sometimes magnesium to burn, along with alcohol and
people to party, Housouer said.</TE>
<TE>   They had an easier time finding a party before the Imperial County
Board of Supervisors implemented a curfew this month on what is
called Competition Hill. The hill can be seen from California 78.</TE>
<TE>   Mason, of the duners' group, blames the truckloads of partyers for
soiling the off-roaders' reputation. The majority of duners are
heavily invested in the sport, he said. His buggy cost $50,000 and
has an 8-cylinder Sprint race-car engine and the transmission of a
'79 Buick Riviera.</TE>
<TE>   Some spend as much as $100,000 building their buggies, he said,
and bring their families out to ride and to camp.</TE>
<TE>   Mason's group handed out "Duner's Survival Kits" with safety
brochures and a video and worked to self-police the off-roaders.
Several times a year the group gathers volunteers to clean up the
dunes, which on a holiday weekend like this one, are littered with
cans and trash.</TE>
<TE>   Environmentalists also watched over the events this weekend.</TE>
<TE>   Terry Weiner of the Center for Biological Diversity wondered how
many of the 700 citations this year were issued to duners who crossed
into protected areas. About half of the 150,000 acres of dunes, which
stretch from the Mexican border to the Chocolate Mountains 40 miles
north, are closed to off-roading.</TE>
<TE>   Stephen Razo, a spokesman for the U.S. Bureau of Land Management,
said the agency wouldn't know how many violations occurred until
later this week.</TE>
<TE>   Weiner said in one 15-minute span Saturday, she witnessed four
people cross into protected lands with four-wheel, all-terrain
vehicles.</TE>
<TE>   Environmental advocates said the dunes are a unique ecosystem.</TE>
<TE>   One plant, the milk vetch, is a threatened species subject to
federal protection.</TE>
<TE>   "The violations were worse than I've ever seen them," said Weiner,
who has observed the Thanksgiving weekend events for the last three
years.</TE>

<HD>Some Think Butterfly on City's Logo Flies in Face of

<DL>GOLETA, Calif.</DL>
<LD>For years, this community had an identity crisis worthy of a teenager
living in the shadow of an older brother who captained the football
team.</LD>
<LD>   Santa Barbara was the jewel of the Central Coast. Goleta's sea
views and weather might be every bit as stunning, but its downtown
was frumpish.</LD>
<LD>   Even though the world-class University of California campus is
practically on Goleta's doorstep in an unincorporated section of
Santa Barbara County, no one gave a moment's thought to calling the
school UC Goleta.</LD>
<TE>   Tired of living in a community known as that place west of Santa
Barbara, Goleta voters proclaimed cityhood last year. And recently,
the new city chose an identity in the form of a city logo: a
butterfly hovering over a stylized scene of agricultural row crops
and the ocean. "The butterfly represents beauty and life and movement
and transformation," said Kathy Fritz, whose firm designed the logo.</TE>
<TE>   But some people say the city missed the boat: After all, Goleta in
Spanish means schooner, the seagoing kind, not the glass of beer they
pour down at the Mercury Lounge. Much of the agriculture depicted in
the logo is long gone, replaced by housing tracts. And a developer
has talked about building homes near the roosting place of the
monarch butterflies that the logo is supposed to represent.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm very disappointed," Councilwoman Jean Blois said of the logo.
"We were on vacation when the vote came up. I was glad because I
don't know if I could have voted for it."</TE>
<TE>   The transformation to cityhood has not been easy or quick. City
Council members are crammed into a 10-by-10-foot office with no
pictures on the wall. They just hired a city manager in August. The
prospects for building a city hall are, in the words of Mayor
Margaret Connell, "a long way off." But when they adopted their first
budget in July, a $12-million spending plan, they found $1 million
more than expected. "We're feeling reasonably confident," Connell
said.</TE>
<TE>   Especially now that they've chosen a symbol to guide them into
their uncharted municipal future. But even that process was
challenging.</TE>
<TE>   First, the Santa Barbara News-Press sponsored a contest allowing
its readers to submit ideas. More than 70 people participated. Some
ideas were serious, while others were funny, or meant to be. Good and
bad, the one thing all 70 ideas had in common was that they were
unwanted. To Goleta residents, the News-Press contest was an example
of their neighbor's smug condescension. "It was unfortunate," Connell
said of the contest.</TE>
<TE>   Goleta solicited ideas in its own newspapers and then hired Fritz
to bring them to life. "It wasn't simple," Fritz said of the process.
But she's proud of what she came up with, and so apparently were most
of the council members, who voted 4 to 0 for the new logo.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a sad day for me" when the City Council chose the
butterfly, said Robin Cederlof, a fifth - generation resident of
Goleta whose ranching family arrived in 1874. The butterfly "doesn't
have historic significance. There are a couple of people on the
council who are extremely pro-butterfly."</TE>
<TE>   Mayor Connell said the butterfly is not some generic image slapped
on the logo by a New Age hippie trying to promote peace and love
along Hollister Avenue. The eucalyptus grove where the monarchs
gather by the thousands is famed as the "largest over-wintering roost
in California." Ron Nye, president of the Goleta Valley Historical
Society, insists that he's not anti-butterfly. He was just hoping
that whatever logo the city chose would in some way recognize "the
history of the area."</TE>
<TE>   Despite the fact that Goleta as an incorporated city is only a
year old, those who have been around a while point with pride to the
community's role in everything from commerce to war. During World War
II, a German prisoner of war camp was located just outside town.
"They worked on local ranches," Nye said. Also, in the first attack
on American soil since 1812, a Japanese submarine lobbed several
shells in 1942 into the oil fields that used to line the bluffs. No
one was killed, and management handed out pitchforks so that workers
could defend the beach.</TE>
<TE>   Admittedly, a logo containing an oil derrick or a POW camp would
not be suitable for the thriving bedroom community Goleta has become.
Some suggested the tomol, the famed Chumash canoe on which Native
Americans ventured to the Channel Islands 500 years ago.</TE>
<TE>   If any town could claim a link to those ancient seamen, it would
be Goleta, advocates said. One of the largest Native American
settlements was on the shores of the Goleta Slough.</TE>
<TE>   If not a tomol, others asked, what about a sailing ship? "Ocean
vessels were always a part of the community," Cederlof said. She said
Spanish ships used the area to offload lumber cut from forests in
Northern California.</TE>
<TE>   "The one thing that really said Goleta was the schooner," she
said. To most of the council, however, it said boring. "A lot of
other Goleta organizations [such as the Chamber of Commerce] all have
schooners in their logos," Fritz said. The city wanted to be
different.</TE>
<TE>   So what if Goleta means schooner? That doesn't mean you are
confined to using a sailing vessel, she said. Santa Barbara doesn't
have St. Barbara in its logo. It has two sailing ships. As for any
threat to the butterflies from developers, Connell said Goleta is
working on a land swap to make sure the butterflies last as long as
the logo.</TE>
<TE>   The arguments don't impress the aggrieved opponents. "When people
think of Goleta," Blois said, "I don't think they think of the
monarch butterfly."</TE>

<LD>In the weeks after the Sept. 11 terror attacks, more than 12,000
people employed at Los Angeles International Airport or in the local
airline industry were thrown out of work.</LD>
<LD>   With their lives turned upside down, some could no longer afford
regular meals.</LD>
<LD>   This crisis, as those in the hunger business characterize it,
continues to be felt at the Westside Food Bank in Santa Monica. More
than 14 months after the attacks, the nonprofit group still can't
keep pace with demand.</LD>
<TE>   "We just sent 3,100 pounds of food to one agency," said Bruce
Rankin, executive director of the food bank. "They would have liked
6,000 pounds."</TE>
<TE>   The food bank collects and ships more than 3 million pounds of
food each year to 65 agencies in the western Los Angeles basin;
recipients include food pantries, shelters for the homeless and
churches.</TE>
<TE>   More than 80,000 people, Rankin said, have eaten at least one meal
supplied by the food bank in 2002.</TE>
<TE>   The nonprofit agency is among dozens of Southern California
organizations that have received donations from the Los Angeles Times
Holiday Campaign. During this season's fund-raising drive, The Times
is featuring charities that provide a range of services to families
and youths in the region.</TE>
<TE>   On the Westside, many people are surprised by the number of hungry
people in the surrounding well-heeled communities, Rankin said.</TE>
<TE>   "For people who live here in Santa Monica, in particular, it's
hard to understand," he said. "Most of what they know about poverty
comes from seeing homeless people in the street, but that's only the
tip of the iceberg."</TE>
<TE>   Many of the working poor face a cruel decision. "It's either pay
rent or eat," said Judy Alexander, associate director of the St.
Joseph Center, a recipient of the food bank's goods. Free food, she
said, allows many people to pay for a place to live.</TE>
<TE>   But donations to the food bank are down; a reeling stock market
has caused charitable foundations to rein in their giving. Because of
that, this year's budget at the food bank will be $50,000 less than
the budget for 2001, Rankin said.</TE>
<TE>   One recent morning, the food bank's warehouse was partly filled
with sacks of rice and beans and boxes of bananas, cans of spaghetti
sauce and macaroni. Hanging from a loft above the boxes was a banner
with the group's motto: "Working for a hunger free community."</TE>
<TE>   It's a mission that keeps getting harder to accomplish, said
Rankin, surrounded by the large stockpile of food that still wasn't
enough.</TE>
<TE>   The Times' annual Holiday Campaign, established in 2000, is a part
of the Los Angeles Times Family Fund, a fund of the McCormick Tribune
Foundation. The foundation matches the first $700,000 raised at 50
cents on the dollar.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   HOW TO GIVE</TE>

<HD>Identity Theft Is on Rise in State</HD>
<DH>FBI official says more global cooperation is needed to
fight fastest growing crime problem.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>William Overend</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Greater international cooperation is needed to fight a growing
identity theft problem in California because many of the cyber
criminals who victimize people here operate outside the United
States, the state's top-ranking FBI official says.</LD>
<LD>   FBI Assistant Director Ronald Iden, head of the bureau's Los
Angeles division, spoke in the aftermath of a New York identity theft
case described as the largest in U.S. history. He agreed with state
officials that identity theft is the fastest-growing crime problem in
California.</LD>
<LD>   On Nov. 25, federal officials in New York charged three men with
swindling 30,000 victims across the country out of at least $2.7
million. Cases of a similar magnitude are most likely unfolding now
in California and elsewhere, and the public should expect more of
them, Iden said.</LD>
<TE>   The state Department of Justice helps fund five cyber crime task
forces throughout the state, and their investigators all report that
they are overwhelmed with identity theft cases. The Secret Service
recently established two similar groups in California focusing partly
on protecting financial infrastructures.</TE>
<TE>   While state and federal law enforcement agencies investigate
identity theft, Iden said the FBI's focus is concentrated on groups
or what he calls "criminal enterprises." Iden said he doesn't use the
term organized crime because the people involved often are
disorganized.</TE>
<TE>   "Somebody in Latvia might be using stolen identities to order
shipments of computers, for example," he said. "Or criminal groups
anywhere outside this country can now loot bank and credit accounts
here."</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, businesses and the public must be more alert to
computer identity theft crimes, Iden said. One recent FBI survey
showed that 90% of businesses contacted had discovered intrusions in
their computer systems. But only a third of those had reported them
to law enforcement agencies.</TE>
<TE>   "At every level, law enforcement needs reports faster," he said.
"People should be watching for even small discrepancies in their bank
and credit card statements. Cyber thieves can hit hundreds or
thousands of people for small amounts."</TE>
<TE>   Identity thieves typically use such financial and personal
information as Social Security numbers, birth dates and bank and
credit account numbers. They can print phony checks on home
computers, make fraudulent credit card purchases and wreck a victim's
credit rating for years.</TE>
<TE>   California Deputy Atty. Gen. Robert Morgester said many identity
thieves begin by stealing mail, literally following mail trucks
around. "It's so easy, it's amazing," he said.</TE>

<HD>Saburo Ienaga, 89; Fought Censorship</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>TOKYO</DL>
<LD>Saburo Ienaga, a Japanese historian who devoted his life to battling
government censorship of Japan's wartime atrocities in school
textbooks, died Sunday, a Japanese news agency reported. He was 89.</LD>
<LD>   Ienaga, a professor at Tokyo University of Education, now Tsukuba
University, died at a Tokyo hospital, the Kyodo News agency said. The
agency did not cite the cause of death.</LD>
<LD>   The educator began his court battles over textbooks in the
mid-1960s and led the movement by teachers and their supporters
against Japan's government textbook screening for nearly four
decades.</LD>
<TE>   In his most recent victory, the Japanese Supreme Court ruled in
1997 that the education ministry unconstitutionally blocked mention
of Japanese wartime atrocities in Ienaga's 1983 high school text.</TE>
<TE>   The passages discussed Japan's deadly experiments on Chinese
prisoners.</TE>
<TE>   The ruling was the first time Japan's highest court had
acknowledged a legal limit to the government's textbook screening.</TE>
<TE>   It also gave a boost to teaching schoolchildren more about Japan's
aggression in Asia in the first half of the 1900s.</TE>
<TE>   Japan is one of the few countries that allows government
textbook-screening.</TE>
<TE>   Ienaga lost most of his court battles, and sometimes required
police protection from right-wing thugs who believed the historian
had disgraced Japan and the emperor.</TE>
<TE>   But many people believe his campaign helped slowly relax
censorship of war crimes in textbooks.</TE>
<TE>   Some high school history textbooks now contain vague references to
Asian women forced to serve as prostitutes for Japanese soldiers
during World War II, and slave laborers who were forcibly brought to
Japan from Korea and China to dig tunnels and mines for the Imperial
Army.</TE>

<HD>Social Crusader Now Part of the Establishment</HD>
<DH>Maricela Morales, who will be sworn in on the Port Hueneme
City Council on Wednesday, focuses on support services for the poor.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Sandra Murillo</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>If Maricela Morales had followed the path she laid out as a little
girl, she'd be a nun or a doctor today. Instead, the petite, once-shy
woman is revving up for the decidedly secular, often brutal world of
local politics.</LD>
<LD>   On Wednesday, Morales will be sworn in as Port Hueneme's newest
City Council member. An official with the Ventura-based Central Coast
Alliance United for a Sustainable Economy, a group that lobbies for
the living wage and other issues, Morales will become a member of the
establishment she is trying to sway.</LD>
<LD>   She won the council position in her first bid for local office. In
this financially stable, relatively quiet seaside community, Morales
stood out by making social issues a part of her platform. She talked
about recreational opportunities for the poor and a living-wage
ordinance, while other candidates talked about financial reserves,
sewer systems and beach erosion.</LD>
<TE>   Morales was one of six candidates vying for three seats on the
Port Hueneme City Council. She placed third behind Mayor Tony Volante
and Councilman Jon Sharkey, edging Steven Kinney by about 65 votes.</TE>
<TE>   She raised more money than the other candidates, and most of her
support came from the older, less-affluent areas of the city, Sharkey
said.</TE>
<TE>   Morales credits her unlikely win to a combination of her political
platform and old-fashioned, street-level campaigning.</TE>
<TE>   "Finances and sewers are very important issues, but these are the
mandatory things all councils everywhere must do," Morales said. "I'm
interested in beginning a dialogue about pressing issues, and I think
the voters responded to that."</TE>
<TE>   Morales is the first Latina elected to the council in decades. And
at 32, she's practically a baby, politically speaking.</TE>
<TE>   "When I was her age, I was still playing at punk-rock clubs in
L.A.," Sharkey said. "We're looking forward to the perspective she'll
bring to us. I mean, if you don't want to change things, then what's
the point of running for office? That said, there's a lot to learn
once you get on the council."</TE>
<TE>   But Morales has always been a quick study. The daughter of
immigrant parents who owned a grocery store in Fillmore, Morales
learned English, breezed through high school and got accepted to
Stanford University. For a long time she wanted to be a nun but
decided that medicine would probably be the more direct route to
helping people.</TE>
<TE>   "What I wanted to do was somehow be of service," Morales said. "It
was what drove me."</TE>
<TE>   She was a senior in college when she realized that the title Dr.
Morales didn't have such a great ring to it after all. For years, she
had volunteered as a medical assistant and patient advocate at
clinics, and knew that what she most enjoyed was making patients feel
at ease.</TE>
<TE>   "I hated my science courses and loved my social sciences classes,"
she said. "For the most part, Western medicine separates the mind
from the body. I realized that it reduces the person to a machine,
and that's not how I wanted to view people."</TE>
<TE>   After graduating with a degree in biology, Morales lived and
worked at the Covenant House Faith Community in Hollywood, where she
led "a life of simplicity" and tried to help teenage runaways find
jobs. Although she had ruled out life as a nun, her religion and
spirituality were still "at the core" of who she was, and she wanted
to immerse herself in full-time volunteer work, Morales said.</TE>
<TE>   The Covenant House volunteers "each got paid $12 every two weeks,"
Morales said, smiling. "We would all go grocery shopping and actually
have discussions on whether we would buy peanut butter and jelly or
live simply and just get the peanut butter."</TE>
<TE>   For the next several years she worked at various Ventura County
educational and nonprofit social service agencies, doing everything
from giving presentations on drug abuse to creating programs
encouraging parental involvement in the schools.</TE>
<TE>   She wound up working at El Concilio del Condado de Ventura, an
Oxnard social service agency, and that's where she began to see that
she could best help people not one by one, but policy by policy.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a total paradigm shift," Morales said. "All along, I'd
been working on serving the individual, doing the emergency-room work
when I could be doing this at another level."</TE>
<TE>   In her present job as associate executive director of the Central
Coast Alliance United for a Sustainable Economy, Morales uses
research to fight what she sees as economic inequalities. Health
coverage for the uninsured, living-wage ordinances and the economic
status of women are the alliance's main issues at the moment. They
are issues she hopes to address in Port Hueneme as well, she said.</TE>
<TE>   Morales said the indifference of some local politicians to the
living-wage issue convinced her to run for office.</TE>
<TE>   "I became very discouraged with the lack of social consciousness
of local officials," Morales said. "Socially conscious individuals
are needed everywhere. Voters know this and they're with me."</TE>

<HD>Edward L. Beach; Naval Captain, Author of 'Run Silent, Run
Deep'</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Edward Latimer "Ned" Beach, author of the best-selling thriller "Run
Silent, Run Deep," which was made into a major motion picture, died
Sunday. The U.S. Navy captain, whose 1960 record for circumnavigating
the globe in a submarine still stands, was 84.</LD>
<LD>   Beach, who had cancer, died at his Washington, D.C., home, said
his son, Edward Beach III.</LD>
<LD>   The public may best remember Beach for "Run Silent, Run Deep,"
which was made into the 1958 film starring Clark Gable and Burt
Lancaster. But for Beach, author of 11 books and countless articles
for such magazines as Argosy, National Geographic and Esquire,
writing was a sideline. His career was the Navy.</LD>
<TE>   Beach was born in New York City in 1918 to a Navy officer, a
captain who had served in actions in the Philippines and the
Caribbean.</TE>
<TE>   His father tried to dissuade him from the rigors of a Navy career,
but he persisted and graduated second in his class at the U.S. Naval
Academy in 1939.</TE>
<TE>   The younger Beach earned 10 decorations for gallantry in World War
II, including the Navy Cross for his role in sinking Japanese ships
in shallow waters just miles from the enemy coast.</TE>
<TE>   He later recalled saying goodbye to the crew of the U.S. submarine
Trigger in May 1944, where he had served as second-in-command, when
he was transferred to another submarine.</TE>
<TE>   "What I didn't realize was that we were splitting those who were
going to live from those who were going to die," he said. The
Japanese sank the Trigger in March 1945, and all aboard died.</TE>
<TE>   The drama of the cramped quarters of a submarine at war was the
basis for the 1955 novel, "Run Silent, Run Deep," which was about a
clash between a revenge-obsessed captain and his crew. He wrote it
while working as a naval aide to President Eisenhower.</TE>
<TE>   Asked once how he had had time to write the book, Beach said:
"Instead of playing golf or going to a lot of parties, I would come
home after hours at the White House, sit in my living room with a
clipboard and write." His father also wrote novels while a naval
officer.</TE>
<TE>   Screenwriter John Gay crafted the film script for Gable and
Lancaster from Beach's novel. Leonard Maltin in his annual movie and
video guide has called the highly successful movie "one of the great
World War II 'sub' pictures."</TE>
<TE>   But Beach didn't like its melodrama. "It's not true to the Navy
that I saw and tried to describe," he told All Hands, a Navy
periodical, in 1999.</TE>
<TE>   In 1960, Beach commanded the Triton, a nuclear-powered submarine
that circumnavigated the globe in 84 days -- a record that still
stands. With his crew of 183 officers and men, Beach followed much
the same route as the explorer Magellan had sailed in 1519-22, only
underwater. The Triton, the world's first submarine equipped with
twin nuclear reactors, left Groton, Conn., on Feb. 16, 1960, and
surfaced off Rehoboth Beach, Del., less than three months later on
May 10.</TE>
<TE>   Beach's account of the voyage, "Around the World Submerged," was
published in 1962. He said it had been tougher to endure a 24-hour
depth-charging from the Japanese than to circumnavigate the globe
beneath the ocean surface.</TE>
<TE>   He retired in 1966, and turned his pen to sometimes sharp
critiques of his former employer.</TE>
<TE>   In his 1995 book, "Scapegoats! A Defense of Kimmel and Short at
Pearl Harbor," Beach made the case that Adm. Husband E. Kimmel and
Gen. Walter C. Short were wrongfully blamed for being caught
off-guard in the devastating Dec. 7, 1941, Japanese air attack. Beach
blamed Pentagon officials in Washington for failing to transmit
accurate war warnings in time.</TE>
<TE>   Among Beach's books were "Submarine!" in 1952, "The Wreck of the
Memphis" in 1966, "Dust on the Sea" in 1972, "Cold Is the Sea" in
1978 and "U.S. Navy Today: A Portrait" in 1982.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to his military service medals, he received the Alfred
Thayer Mahan Award for literary achievement from the U.S. Navy League
in 1980.</TE>
<TE>   Beach also wrote a television script, "Enrico Tazzoli."</TE>
<TE>   He will be buried in Annapolis, Md., directly across the street
from Beach Hall, headquarters of the Naval Institute Press. This
building was dedicated in tribute to both Capts. Beach, father and
son, in 1999.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to his son Edward, Beach is survived by his wife,
Ingrid; another son; a daughter; a sister; and four grandchildren.</TE>

<HD>Ernest Leiser, 81; Director of CBS News, Longtime Producer</HD>

<BD>From Times Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Ernest Leiser, 81, a CBS News producer who hired the network's
current anchor, Dan Rather, died Tuesday of an apparent heart attack
in South Nyack, N.Y.</LD>
<LD>   A native of Philadelphia, Leiser graduated from the University of
Chicago and served in the Army during World War II as a correspondent
for Stars &amp; Stripes. He worked mostly in Europe, where he was jailed
briefly by Communists while covering the revolt in Hungary in 1956.</LD>
<LD>   Leiser was named director of CBS News in 1964, where he hired
Rather and served as executive producer of the "CBS Evening News with
Walter Cronkite." Leiser spent 1972 to 1975 as an executive producer
for ABC News, then returned to CBS to head coverage of political
conventions and elections until his retirement in 1985.</LD>
<TE>   Rather called Leiser "a classy gentleman, a thorough scholar, an
integrity-filled journalist and a visionary leader of other
journalists and said Leiser "repeatedly proved he was one of the
bravest and best American journalists in history."</TE>

<HD>Where Christmas Is a Growth Business</HD>
<DH>Trimmings, including $1,000 wreaths, appear museum-quality
at Newport nursery.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Monte Morin</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When you call yourself "America's Most Beautiful Home and Garden
Center," you'd best not kid around, especially during the holiday
season.</LD>
<LD>   Nestled deep within the conspicuously consumptive heart of Orange
County, just a credit card's throw from Fashion Island, is Roger's
Gardens. Considered by many the nation's premier nursery, the
seven-acre center caters to the Gold Coast's wealthiest and most
discriminating consumers, a cost-be-damned lot who regard the Corona
del Mar establishment as the ultimate arbiter of home and garden
decor.</LD>
<LD>   Unlike chain nurseries that display merchandise on racks in
militarily precise rows, Roger's Gardens looks like a museum or
finely landscaped public garden, where pathways wind among gurgling
fountains, rare plantings and hanging moss baskets. Hidden speakers
pump out classical music, and a barrista serves up espresso and
cappuccino. Think Disneyland, not garden center, says nursery manager
Roy Vanderhoff.</LD>
<TE>   The center's preoccupation with raising the bar on home aesthetics
and entertainment is never more apparent than now, when Roger's
Gardens showcases its 5,000-square-foot gallery of holiday
decorations -- a color-clotted swirl of 30 themed Christmas trees,
glittery glass-blown ornaments, lights, life-size stuffed animals and
an army of hand-painted nutcrackers.</TE>
<TE>   The merchandise, which operators say is displayed in unique and
creative ways that will "pull at the heartstrings," also tug at the
purse strings. Among this season's hot sellers is a sumptuous,
oversized Christmas wreath studded with silk roses and highly
collectible Christopher Radko tree ornaments. The wreath sells for
about $1,000.</TE>
<TE>   "It's like we can't make them fast enough," said Lisa
Featherstone, director of marketing and advertising. "They're
gorgeous."</TE>
<TE>   Many of the ornaments are exclusive releases by designers
including Radko and Larry Fraga and inspire an almost fanatical
devotion among collectors.</TE>
<TE>   Arranged by themes -- such as sports, babies, Santa Claus,
wildlife, religious symbols and colors -- the ornaments can fetch up
to $100 each.</TE>
<TE>   Customers pile ornaments into wire shopping containers. Parents of
young children, meanwhile, eye their charges nervously. Even a single
well-placed swat by a rambunctious youngster could send several
hundred dollars' worth of glitter-painted ornaments crashing to the
ground.</TE>
<TE>   "We do get some breakage," Featherstone conceded.</TE>
<TE>   Among other seasonal attractions, workers string more than 100,000
lights throughout the nursery, an impressive sight in the evening.</TE>
<TE>   "This is over the top," said a goggle-eyed Jack Brenton as he
wandered through a forest of Christmas tree hangings, wreaths and
dolls.</TE>
<TE>   A recent transplant from Hanover, Mass., Brenton was visiting the
garden center for the first time last week. "I'm lost in this place,"
he said.</TE>
<TE>   To be sure, any of the half-million customers who will visit
Roger's Gardens between Halloween and Christmas this year can find
decorations priced at well below $1,000. But the center's reputation
for expensive gifts endures.</TE>
<TE>   "People see us as a high-end retailer, but we're not necessarily
just that," Featherstone said. "We have $3.99 ornaments that look
like they're $10.99. We're very competitive."</TE>
<TE>   A special tent offers a selection of remarkably lifelike
artificial trees -- the only kind of holiday trees the nursery sells.
The trees, which open and close like umbrellas, come with Christmas
lights installed or without. Prices range from $95 for a 5-foot
unlighted tree to $1,175 for a 12-foot, pre-lit Tahoe-style tree.</TE>
<TE>   Garden operators don't find any contradiction in the fact that one
of the most well-regarded nurseries offers only artificial Christmas
trees.</TE>
<TE>   "For one, we really don't have the facilities for cut trees," said
Vanderhoff, the nursery manager. "But also, a cut tree is a cut tree.
There aren't a lot of high-quality cut trees, but when it comes to
artificial trees there are. We like to deal in those high-end
artificial trees."</TE>
<TE>   Among customers weighing whether to buy her first artificial tree
was Joan Wilcox of Newport Beach. "I've always had cut trees, but I
live alone now and I don't want my children to have to come down here
and drag one in for me."</TE>
<TE>   Wilcox was eyeing a $225 tree but couldn't make up her mind. "The
cost is the issue. That, and I've always liked the smell of the real
trees."</TE>
<TE>   Roger's Gardens began offering Christmas decorations more than 20
years ago, as a means of rounding out its sales season. The nursery
business is traditionally very slow between July and December, so
center managers set out to make the nursery a holiday destination.</TE>
<TE>   Judging by customers' reactions, they succeeded.</TE>
<TE>   "I buy quite a bit here on the holidays," said Linda Cox as she
examined a bright silk imitation poinsettia. The Huntington Beach
psychotherapist said she enjoys visiting Roger's Gardens on the
holidays because it's different from other commercial draws.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of people try to fill themselves up with things when they
feel empty, and a lot of that occurs during the holidays when people
are shopping," Cox said. "For me, Roger's Gardens is a place of
serenity. It's got beautiful gardens and lovely plants. It's peace
and tranquillity."</TE>

<LD>Last week's two-hour biography of Ronald Reagan on the History
Channel resonated of hail-and-farewell to the Alzheimer's-afflicted
91-year-old former president.</LD>
<LD>   Among the interviewees from Reagan's long-ago tenure as Golden
State governor was strategist Ken Khachigian.</LD>
<LD>   Reagan's first speech after being shot in 1981 was to a joint
session of Congress, and Khachigian confessed that he wanted to "milk
the occasion shamelessly."</LD>
<TE>   So when he delivered his final draft of the speech, he also gave
the president a copy of a letter that had arrived earlier at the
White House and suggested that Reagan use it in his speech.</TE>
<TE>   The president initially gave it back to him, but Khachigian
pressed it on Reagan again, suggesting, "Why don't you show it to
Mrs. Reagan?"</TE>
<TE>   The president took it back, read it and kept it. "I've got an
idea," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Delivering his speech, he departed from the TelePrompTer script as
he mentioned having received the good wishes of "compassionate
Americans and their children, from college age to kindergarten."</TE>
<TE>   He pulled the letter from his pocket and read, "As a matter of
fact, as evidence of that I have a letter from Peter Sweeney. He's in
the second grade in the Riverside School in Rockville Centre, and he
said: 'I hope you get well quick or you might have to make a speech
in your pajamas.' "</TE>
<TE>   The audience broke up, and Congress passed Reagan's economic
recovery plan.</TE>
<TE>   A Cornucopia of Proclamations</TE>
<TE>   The news release listing all the state of California proclamations
for November was actually dated Nov. 27, but, heck, November was a
busy month for the governor, what with the election and all, and it
must have just slipped his mind.</TE>
<TE>   November was Alzheimer's Awareness Month, California Career
Development Month, California Court Adoption and Permanency Month,
Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease Awareness Month, Diabetes
Awareness Month and Lung Cancer Awareness Month.</TE>
<TE>   On the state's November calendar you will also find Nurse
Practitioner Week, California Groundwater Week, Key Club Week,
California Veterans Awareness Week, California Family Week and,
finally, Thanksgiving Prayer Week.</TE>
<TE>   Mayor, 'Acting Mayor' Promote 'GreenLA'</TE>
<TE>   After a TV hiatus of several months, leading Mayor Jim Hahn is
back on the air. Two public service spots of 15 and 30 seconds that
he taped in February with actor Barry Bostwick, who plays the mayor
of New York on the show "Spin City," are back on the air.</TE>
<TE>   (Does this mean residuals for Hahn?)</TE>
<TE>   The spots promote the DWP's energy-efficient "GreenLA" programs,
which help consumers pay for solar energy systems and efficient
appliances, and gives free trees to promote it all.</TE>
<TE>   The script, full of constructive badinage between "Barry" and
"Mayor," instructs "Mayor" to smile at a couple of points. Sample

trees at your residence or business, because more shade means more
energy conservation."</TE>

<TE>   Lobbyists' Lucre Hits a Los Angeles Record</TE>
<TE>   Hey, big spenders -- a record $4.24 million crossed the palms of
lobbyists in Los Angeles in three months. Biggest single nudge-cause,
according to city Ethics Commission records, was the $179,945
free-spending frenzy by eight companies seeking TV cable franchises.</TE>
<TE>   An additional $151,850 was shelled out for lobbyists trying to get
the city to green-light cell phone antennae; $151,033 filled the
paychecks of lobbyists for the Playa Vista development in the Ballona
wetlands; and $93,487 was spent by Mitsubishi Corp., which wants to
open a liquefied natural gas receiving terminal at the city's port.</TE>
<TE>   A combined $218,000 was spent by various firms seeking concessions
at city airports -- look to see whether the price of those packs of
peanuts goes up -- along with the city of El Segundo, putting in more
than its two cents' worth on airport modernization.</TE>
<TE>   And the Blame Game Winners Are ...</TE>
<TE>   There's less than a month left for those end-of-the-year
best-and-worst lists, and first out of the chute are the folks of
Orange County Citizens Against Lawsuit Abuse.</TE>
<TE>   Topping their list of most creative food-related lawsuits of 2002:</TE>
<TE>   * The New York maintenance man who claimed that a fast-food diet
at McDonald's, Wendy's, Burger King and KFC made him an unwitting
addict -- and an obese one at that.</TE>
<TE>   * The lawsuit against Hershey and Mars candy makers, among others,
for allegedly violating California's Proposition 65, which requires
warnings about carcinogens in food. (The state attorney general found
that the traces of lead in chocolate products are not added, but
naturally occurring, and the law exempts naturally occurring toxic
chemicals.)</TE>
<TE>   * The New Jersey couple's $100,000 suit against Kellogg's for
damage caused by a Pop-Tart that caught fire after being left
unattended in a toaster. File that under "pop torts."</TE>
<TE>   Secession Vote Yields Slew of Latino Politicos</TE>
<TE>   There's no new Valley city, but there's a load of new Valley
Latino politicians.</TE>
<TE>   Four Latinos won the races for the 14 council seats that would
have been created for a new city, and Latinos placed second and third
in the Valley mayor's race. And in the Hollywood wannabe election,
the most votes for the might-have-been city council were collected by
neighborhood activist Rosa Martinez.</TE>
<TE>   Thus encouraged, Valley city candidates Jose Roy Garcia,
Christopher Cleto Trujillo and Jose Bonilla have filed papers to run
for the L.A. City Council's 6th District seat, which is being vacated
by term-limited Ruth Galanter.</TE>
<TE>   Points Taken</TE>
<TE>   * Snatching breakfast from the jaw of defeat, GOP state party
Chairman Shawn Steel will be guest speaker in Rosemead for Thursday's
"Victory Elephant Breakfast," sponsored by the party's 49th Assembly
District group. The news release notes with fine understatement that
Steel "came to the position of chairman of the California Republican
Party at a difficult time."</TE>
<TE>   * First-out-of-the-box award: Laguna Niguel Councilwoman Mimi
Walters, announcing she's running in 2004 for the Assembly seat held
by future term-limited Pat Bates.</TE>
<TE>   Bates is thinking about running in 2006 for the state Senate seat
held by Bill Morrow, who will then be term-out himself.</TE>
<TE>   Anybody for 2008?</TE>
<TE>   * The nation's Republican governors were high-fiving one another
in Dana Point, gathering together to celebrate their election gains
... but doing it in the hostile territory of California, where
Democrats swept all the statewide races for the first time since
1882.</TE>
<TE>   * Dolores Huerta, the legendary labor organizer who, with Cesar
Chavez, co-founded the United Farm Workers, has been awarded the
Puffin/Nation Prize for creative citizenship, a $100,000 cash award
to the citizen who "has challenged the status quo through
distinctive, courageous, imaginative, socially responsible work."</TE>
<TE>   * Danney Ball, a Hemet songwriter who pulled down a cool 1% in
last spring's Republican gubernatorial primary, is advertising for
campaign consultants, fund-raisers and an "Internet marketing genius"
for his planned 2004 campaign against Sen. Barbara Boxer.</TE>
<TE>   Lest you confuse this with those million-dollar campaigns, keep in
mind that Ball pledged to spend no more than $20,000 in his
gubernatorial try.</TE>
<TE>   You Can Quote Me</TE>
<TE>   "The state is facing a budget crisis. We decided to save both
money and abandoned dogs by establishing our own program."</TE>
<TE>   CHP Commissioner D.O. "Spike" Helmick. The CHP graduated nine dogs
from its new bomb-sniffing training program, several of them rescued
from animal shelters, including Manny, a golden Labrador retriever
who was one day away from being killed by lethal injection when he
was chosen. The state had heretofore bought bomb-sniffing dogs from
outside agencies.</TE>

<HD>Lake Forest Council Clash Is Taken a Step Further</HD>
<DH>Kathryn McCullough wants a restraining order against
colleague Peter Herzog, saying he's assaulted her. He denies the
accusations.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Dave McKibben</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>City council members have long been known to clash during emotionally
charged public meetings or behind closed doors. That's where it
usually ends.</LD>
<LD>   But in Lake Forest, a conflict between two council members -- both
reelected to four-year terms in November -- has reached a new level,
with one seeking a restraining order against the other.</LD>
<LD>   Longtime Councilwoman Kathryn McCullough said Councilman Peter
Herzog has verbally and physically assaulted her in separate
incidents during the last four months.</LD>
<TE>   Just before the Nov. 5 election, she sought a restraining order
against him.</TE>
<TE>   Herzog, 47, said there is no truth to McCullough's allegations.
"This is out of left field," he said. "I never yelled at her or used
profanity. We've had disagreements like most elected officials, but
nothing leading to these absurd kind of incidents."</TE>
<TE>   In a four-page petition, however, McCullough said she was shouted
at by Herzog during a California League of Cities reception July 25
in Monterey and then had her arm "grabbed and pulled" by Herzog after
a Sept. 17 council meeting.</TE>
<TE>   McCullough's request for a temporary restraining order is
scheduled to be heard Dec. 18 in civil court.</TE>
<TE>   Among other issues, the two have disagreed over McCullough's
fitness to serve as mayor, a largely ceremonial duty that typically
rotates among council members. Two years ago, Herzog unsuccessfully
opposed McCullough's appointment as mayor for 2001.</TE>
<TE>   McCullough was not available for comment, but Councilwoman Marcia
Rudolph, a close friend and colleague, said McCullough is not seeking
a restraining order that would apply during council meetings or other
official functions -- although the alleged assaults have occurred
during such events.</TE>
<TE>   "Kathy has not asked for that separation when they are doing city
business," said Rudolph, who has known McCullough for more than 20
years.</TE>
<TE>   According to court documents, McCullough said Herzog verbally
attacked her over her choice of political allies on the Lake Forest
City Council.</TE>
<TE>   "His vulgarity and shouting was so loud that an older man [nearby]
asked me if I was OK," McCullough said in court documents.</TE>
<TE>   McCullough said her altercation with Herzog outside council
chambers Sept. 17 caused tendon damage in her wrist.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't feel safe anymore," McCullough, 60, said in the document.
"I cry for no reason, and I am reluctant to go places for fear that
he is going to go off the next time and kill me."</TE>
<TE>   Richard Dixon, the city's mayor, said the dispute has not affected
either council member's government duties.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a private matter between two individuals, and it's not
impacting the city or the City Council meetings," Dixon said.</TE>
<TE>   "No one says they have to be best friends and hang out socially to
do the job they are elected to do."</TE>

<HD>El Toro's Buffer Zone Limits Up for State Review</HD>
<DH>Developers want restrictions lifted on property near Orange
County's 'golden triangle.' Deadline for comment is Wednesday.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jean O. Pasco</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The El Toro airport plan is dead. But a state panel wants to keep in
place building restrictions on 14,000 acres of prime real estate
around the closed military air base.</LD>
<LD>   Developers have been eyeing the land since the base closed in July
1999 for upscale homes and higher-density commercial space if limits
were to be lifted.</LD>
<LD>   The land is near Orange County's "golden triangle"--a vast swath
of property where the Santa Ana and San Diego freeways meet in
Irvine. Homes, schools and dense development have been barred for
nearly 40 years because of noise from military jets and the potential
dangers from crashes.</LD>
<TE>   Voters in March rejected the county's plans to transform the
former Marine base into a major commercial airport. Voters rezoned
the 4,700-acre base for a large park and other uses.</TE>
<TE>   Frustrated city officials in south Orange County said they can't
fathom why the Airport Land Use Commission wants to continue
restrictions they consider outdated. The commission argues that the
rules should remain until the military turns over El Toro -- a
process that could take several years.</TE>
<TE>   The edict affects land in Irvine, Lake Forest and Laguna Woods,
Rancho Santa Margarita and Aliso Viejo.</TE>
<TE>   Much of the so-called buffer zone already has been developed with
low-level commercial sites, which is allowed under the restrictions.
But cities see some of those buildings being replaced with larger
commercial and residential development. About 4,000 acres of the
buffer zone are undeveloped.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm appalled that a government agency can just stick its head in
the sand," said Lake Forest City Councilman Peter Herzog.</TE>
<TE>   "There's no question that an airport at El Toro is pretty much
dead," added Irvine Mayor Larry Agran. "It'd be nice if other public
agencies caught up to that reality."</TE>
<TE>   The land is tantalizing, particularly for new homes, said Richard
Gollis, a principal with the Concord Group, a real-estate consulting
company in Newport Beach.</TE>
<TE>   "Irvine is a huge job center, but they need housing," said Gollis,
who heads the Orange County chapter of the Urban Planning Institute.
"A lot of [the property] could easily be converted to residential
with supporting commercial [areas]."</TE>
<TE>   The Airport Land Use Commission is set to vote Dec. 19 on whether
to keep the limits around El Toro, as well as John Wayne Airport,
Fullerton Municipal Airport and the Joint Forces Training Base at Los
Alamitos. Written comments on the issue will be accepted by the
commission through Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   Commission officials say they have no choice but to continue the
restrictions around El Toro because the land is still owned by the
federal government.</TE>
<TE>   A judge ruled last year in a lawsuit brought by Lake Forest and
Irvine that the commission had the authority to continue the building
limits at least until the Navy conveyed the property to new owners.
The Los Angeles County judge noted that El Toro could be reactivated
during a national emergency.</TE>
<TE>   The Navy told the commission by letter last month that it
shouldn't wait to open up land around El Toro to more intense
development.</TE>
<TE>   The military has no intention of recommissioning the base and is
preparing to sell the property for new homes, businesses and public
park uses, wrote Wayne Arny, principal deputy assistant secretary of
the Navy.</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, the strictest building restrictions -- on areas that
once bore the brunt of jet noise -- haven't been updated since 1981
and "should not be used as a basis for any land use planning effort,"
Arny said.</TE>
<TE>   For the last three years, Irvine has plowed ahead with its
development plans despite commission protests. The city has approved
neighborhoods, high-rises, schools and child-care centers in the
buffer zone, including nearly 15,000 new homes.</TE>
<TE>   "The city of Irvine disagrees ... that [Marine air station] El
Toro 'is in transition,' " Irvine Director of Strategic Planning Dan
Jung wrote to commissioners to protest any continuation of the
limits. "The federal and local decisions regarding the reuse of El
Toro are conclusive. El Toro will not be used as a military or a
commercial facility."</TE>
<TE>   Under state law, the city is allowed to override the commission's
objections. But it also would assume full liability for noise or
property damage if an airport were built at El Toro or the base was
reactivated.</TE>
<TE>   Lake Forest took a more cautious approach with its 2,200 acres in
the buffer zone, of which about 1,000 acres are vacant. That city
hasn't allowed any unauthorized development.</TE>
<TE>   A study next year will examine what might be built in Lake Forest
when restrictions expire.</TE>
<TE>   Given the average pace of residential development in south Orange
County, another 9,000 to 18,000 homes could be built on the vacant
land, Gollis said.</TE>
<TE>   Lake Forest's Herzog said the city is considering asking a court
to intervene if the commission continues the restrictions.</TE>
<TE>   "They're ignoring voters, and they're ignoring the Navy," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Written comments on the commission decision can be sent to Tim
Neely, Environmental Services Planning Division, Planning and
Development Services, P.O. Box 4048, Santa Ana, 92702-4048,

<HD>Woman Rebuts Dean's Claim</HD>
<DH>She says she was sexually assaulted by the UC Berkeley law
school chief, who called the encounter consensual and resigned.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Stuart Silverstein and Rebecca Trounson</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>An attorney for a woman whose claims of sexual harassment led to the
resignation of UC Berkeley's law school dean said Sunday that the
dean "grossly mischaracterized" the incident as consensual and that
the university has repeatedly mishandled the woman's allegations.</LD>
<LD>   Reached in Amsterdam where she was spending the holidays, the
Berkeley attorney, Laura Stevens, said the dean sexually assaulted
her client two years ago after a night of drinking with a group of
students from the university's prestigious Boalt Hall law school.</LD>
<LD>   The lawyer e-mailed the allegations over the weekend to several
media outlets in the United States, including The Times.</LD>
<TE>   The attorney said that before her client filed a formal complaint
against the dean, John P. Dwyer, in October, she tried without
success to address the matter by bringing it to the attention of a
university administrator in charge of harassment claims and three law
school faculty members. Stevens said her client received little
assistance.</TE>
<TE>   Stevens also said that university officials attempted to keep the
matter quiet, asking her client to agree not to discuss it lest
Dwyer's reputation be damaged. The woman refused, Stevens said.</TE>
<TE>   Dwyer announced last Wednesday in a letter to the faculty, staff
and students that he would resign effective Jan. 1 because of the
sexual harassment allegation.</TE>
<TE>   In the letter, which was publicly released by UC Berkeley, Dwyer
said that he "had a single encounter two years ago that was
consensual, but there is no allegation that any form of sexual
intercourse occurred." He went on to say that it "reflected a serious
error in judgment on my part and was inappropriate."</TE>
<TE>   Stevens said in the interview Sunday that her client agrees that
intercourse did not occur. Stevens said that Dwyer came to her
client's apartment after a night of drinking with a group of students
including her client, then a second-year Boalt student.</TE>
<TE>   According to Stevens, the alleged assault took place after her
client passed out, apparently from her evening of drinking.</TE>
<TE>   Dwyer did not return calls for comment late Sunday or late last
week.</TE>
<TE>   Stevens also offered an explanation for why her client, who
graduated in May and is now working as a public interest lawyer,
didn't file the complaint for two years.</TE>
<TE>   The student sought help from several quarters, Stevens said: from
the university's student health center, where she participated in
group and individual therapy; from law school faculty members; and
from the university's Title IX officer, whose position is intended to
ensure campus compliance with federal laws prohibiting harassment.</TE>
<TE>   Stevens said the officer, however, did not know which procedures
applied in connection with a complaint against a dean, and she could
not assure the student that her identity would remain confidential or
that she would be protected from retaliation if she lodged a formal
complaint.</TE>
<TE>   The student, now 27, also reported the incident to three female
law school faculty members, but they expressed doubt about their
responsibilities and concern about possible retaliation if they
became involved, the attorney said.</TE>
<TE>   Because of fears of retaliation, the student then chose to keep
silent until she graduated and took the bar exam, the e-mail
statement said. She retained an attorney and made a formal complaint
under the university's faculty code of conduct in October.</TE>
<TE>   UC Berkeley spokeswoman Janet Gilmore, responding Sunday to the
news release, said she could not discuss what specific allegations
are being investigated by the university, citing privacy
restrictions.</TE>
<TE>   She said, however, that the university is continuing to look into
the former student's complaint as well as the school's general
practices and procedures for sexual harassment complaints. The
investigation is being handed by Janet Yellen, an economist at
Berkeley and a former high-ranking official in the Clinton
administration.</TE>
<TE>   Stevens said in her e-mail that university officials interviewed
the young woman with her lawyer, met with Dwyer and "attempted to
extract an agreement from the student to keep silent about his
conduct, so as not to injure his reputation."</TE>

<HD>Man Found Dead Is Identified</HD>
<DH>The suspected killer of a sheriff's deputy was discovered
in an Artesia home after gunfight.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Bettina Boxall</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A suspect killed in a weekend gunfight that left a Los Angeles County
sheriff's deputy dead was identified Sunday as a 21-year-old Irvine
man as authorities continued their investigation and awaited autopsy
results in the case.</LD>
<LD>   The body of Alberto Reyes was found in an Artesia house Saturday
evening, more than nine hours after deputies first stormed the home
and Deputy David Powell, an 18-year department veteran, was fatally
shot, a Sheriff's Department spokesman said.</LD>
<LD>   The episode began shortly before 11 a.m. Saturday when sheriff's
deputies received a report of gunfire a few blocks away in
neighboring Norwalk. A sheriff's helicopter spotted two men running
from that location and saw one of them enter a house at the rear of a
lot in the 12000 block of 167th Street in Artesia.</LD>
<TE>   When sheriff's patrols arrived at that address, Deputy David
Cervantes, a department spokesman, said, the occupant of a house in
the front told them his sister was in the home to the rear and was
afraid to leave.</TE>
<TE>   Believing that a hostage situation was unfolding, Cervantes said,
three or four deputies surrounded the house. They saw the suspect
peering through a window in the front door and then kicked the door
in.</TE>
<TE>   "A female ran out the front door and shots came from the house,
three to four rounds, one of them striking Powell," Cervantes said.</TE>
<TE>   Powell fell back and another deputy, who was not identified, fired
a single shotgun round into the house, Cervantes said.</TE>
<TE>   Powell, who was pulled away by deputies, had been hit by a bullet
that pierced and exited his right arm and then entered his chest
through a side seam in his protective vest. Powell of Torrance worked
at the sheriff's Lakewood station. He died at a nearby hospital 90
minutes later.</TE>
<TE>   A handgun was found in the house, but pending autopsies today on
Powell and Reyes, authorities could not confirm whether that was the
weapon used to shoot Powell, or if Reyes died of the shotgun blast.</TE>
<TE>   Cervantes said crisis negotiators were at the scene Saturday
afternoon but got no response from the house and did not know whether
the suspect was alive or dead. Deputies found Reyes' body after they
fired tear gas into the home and entered it about 8:30 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   Another suspect, Robert Hernandez, 22, of Buena Park, was found
Saturday hiding in a shed a few blocks away on Arkansas Avenue. He
was booked on a burglary charge and is being held in lieu of $30,000
bail.</TE>
<TE>   Cervantes said authorities were unsure of the cause of the initial
altercation. They believe that Reyes had randomly chosen the house to
which he fled and did not know the woman, who was unhurt and was not
identified.</TE>

<HD>Addicts Treat Others' Overdoses</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>John M. Glionna</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>SAN FRANCISCO</DL>
<LD>In the newest twist in harm reduction among users of dangerous drugs,
a controversial study conducted here suggests that heroin addicts can
be trained to treat fellow junkies against potentially fatal
overdoses.</LD>
<LD>   The project, co-funded by the San Francisco Department of Public
Health, turned 24 longtime heroin users into enterprising street
doctors, organizers say.</LD>
<LD>   Supplied with syringes containing the anti-overdose drug naloxone
and trained in cardio-pulmonary resuscitation, the users were able to
take timely lifesaving measures with a drug now available only to
physicians and paramedics. The moment a companion had an overdose
reaction, the trained addict injected the drug into the victim's leg
or shoulder.</LD>
<TE>   Researchers from the Urban Health Study will release their
naloxone study results Monday at the National Harm Reduction
Conference in Seattle. The group is composed of health-care experts
who specialize in such efforts as needle exchange programs for drug
users.</TE>
<TE>   They also want San Francisco officials to consider becoming the
first major city in the West to distribute naloxone. The drug is
available to addicts in New Mexico and Chicago, and Baltimore
officials plan to start dispensing naloxone next year.</TE>
<TE>   Proponents say naloxone is a legal, nonaddictive drug that does
not produce a high or sense of euphoria. When injected into a major
muscle, naloxone, commonly known by its brand name Narcan, sends
overdose victims into an instant acute withdrawal.</TE>
<TE>   The drug works by binding to the brain receptors that normally
attract opiates such as heroin, morphine or methadone. Without
naloxone, heroin overdose victims often die from respiratory failure.</TE>
<TE>   "This drug has been shown to save lives," said Karen Seal, a
physician and lead author of the 2001 study.</TE>
<TE>   But critics say dispensing naloxone to addicts as a harm reduction
technique is really harm promotion. "You're putting a very serious
medication into the hands of untrained people," said Eric Voth, an
addiction medication specialist and chairman of the nonprofit
Institute on Global Drug Policy.</TE>
<TE>   "The answer to heroin addiction is aggressive outreach, not an
end-around against modern medicine. City officials should beware of
the serious liability issues if someone dies after being administered
this drug by another addict."</TE>
<TE>   Seal, an assistant professor of family and community medicine at
UC San Francisco, said a citywide dissemination of naloxone would
improve the lives of an intravenous drug population estimated to be
as large as 14,000 to 17,000.</TE>
<TE>   Each year, San Francisco hospitals see more than 100 heroin
overdose deaths, many of which Seal believes could have been
prevented. Doing her time in the emergency room, she saw the culture
of heroin while responding to as many as half a dozen overdose
victims a day.</TE>
<TE>   She knows the futile result of street techniques used by junkies
to stop a heroin overdose: everything from injecting victims with
salt water or milk to immersing them in an ice bath.</TE>
<TE>   A bigger problem is that many addicts, when witnessing an
overdose, are reluctant to call 911 or summon help, for fear of
arrest.</TE>
<TE>   Two years ago, Seal set out to discover "why people could stand by
a heroin overdose victim and not intervene."</TE>
<TE>   For six months, her study employed 12 teams of heroin addicts --
users so dependent that they no longer take the drug to get high, but
rather to avoid the agony of withdrawal. After eight hours of
training, participants were given kits containing vials of naloxone,
latex gloves and alcohol wipes.</TE>
<TE>   Half were homeless. Their median age was 40 and one-third were
women. The goal was for each team member to look out for the other
and be on hand with naloxone if one of them overdosed.</TE>
<TE>   In all, the participants witnessed about 20 overdoses and used
naloxone in 14 cases, resorting to CPR in the others. One participant
died after injecting heroin while alone.</TE>
<TE>   Seal said researchers initially feared that they could harm
addicts by giving them naloxone. "We didn't know whether they'd
become vigilantes and use more heroin because they felt they had this
magic anti-overdose antidote," she said.</TE>
<TE>   But researchers found that whereas in the six months before the
study the group reported 68 overdoses, in the six months after the
study only five occurred, although naloxone was no longer available.</TE>
<TE>   Seal said their participation led many study subjects to seek
referrals to methadone clinics, although there is no evidence that
the drug itself does anything to discourage heroin use.</TE>
<TE>   One participant was William Bowden. The 51-year-old Philadelphia
native and longtime junkie said carrying naloxone gave him a new take
on San Francisco's back-alley heroin scene.</TE>
<TE>   "When you're a junkie, nobody cares about you; you don't even care
about yourself," he said. "But this study made me look at things
differently. By being concerned about others, I became more concerned
about myself."</TE>
<TE>   Seal said addicts showed researchers even more enterprise: In more
than half of the 14 cases in which naloxone was used, it was
administered not to the participant's addict partner but to strangers
they encountered on the street.</TE>
<TE>   Many offered mouth-to-mouth emergency treatment to strangers who
were violently ill. "They took a risk of being arrested to save
somebody else," Seal said.</TE>
<TE>   San Francisco officials aren't exactly lining up behind a naloxone
program for addicts.</TE>
<TE>   Joshua Bamberger, medical director of the housing and urban health
section of the city's Department of Public Health, said other
outreach efforts helped drive the city's heroin overdose deaths to a
10-year low of 101 in 2001.</TE>
<TE>   "It's undoubtedly worth exploring," he said of the naloxone plan.
"But I don't know the political lay of the land."</TE>
<TE>   Critics remain disturbed by the image of addicts cast as
lifesavers. They might mistake alcohol or cocaine overdoses and
inject naloxone, delaying proper medical help.</TE>
<TE>   "To receive naloxone is a hellish experience," said Voth of the
Institute on Global Drug Policy. "People go into instant withdrawal
and often suffer vomiting, diarrhea and extreme agitation. I don't
think other addicts could ever be trained to manage such an ordeal."</TE>
<TE>   Seal said study participants were trained for just such a result.
"People who've been given naloxone wake up angry, and we told our
participants the victim might look at them like 'Hey, you just ruined
my high,' " she said.</TE>
<TE>   "People don't understand that they've basically died and have just
been saved."</TE>
<TE>   Despite such drawbacks, public distribution of naloxone has worked
in New Mexico, where a state law passed in 2001 legally protects
people who inject an overdose victim with naloxone. San Francisco
researchers say they would push for a similar liability law.</TE>
<TE>   Chicago also has seen dramatic effects since the drug began being
dispensed through private clinics. "Not long ago, 466 people died in
Cook County alone from heroin overdose in a single year," said Dan
Bigg, executive director of the Chicago Recovery Alliance. "The
people bitten by the snake of heroin addiction couldn't cope."</TE>
<TE>   Last year, the county saw a 20% drop in heroin-related deaths, its
first. Bigg attributed that to getting naloxone onto the streets. "It
works," he said.</TE>
<TE>   In contrast, Portland, Maine, has backed away from a plan to give
naloxone to heroin users. "We got flak from law enforcement and the
community -- letters and e-mails," said Gerald Cayer, the city's
director of Health and Human Services.</TE>
<TE>   But drug policy experts say naloxone's time may have come.</TE>
<TE>   Ricky Bluthenthal, a social scientist in the health program and
drug policy research center at the Rand Corp. in Santa Monica, said
the federal government should encourage study of naloxone use among
heroin addicts.</TE>
<TE>   "If you give drug users the tools that lead them to be healthy,
they'll use them as intended," he said.</TE>

<HD>In Print, Another Vietnam War</HD>
<DH>Hatred of communism moves many of the immigrant publishers
-- often to excess.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Mai Tran</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Vietnam War ended 27 years ago, but the battle against communism
is raging on in the pages of newspapers throughout Little Saigon.</LD>
<LD>   Vietnam Tu Do is one of them, a Vietnamese-language paper that
reaches only 3,000 readers and is delivered by an elderly woman on a
bicycle. But what it lacks in resources it makes up for with an
unmistakable loathing of communism. The front page is filled with
headlines such as "Vietnam Communists Poison the Population" and "The
Corruption of Communism."</LD>
<LD>   "They have destroyed and tricked us. They've bankrupted our
country and made our people suffer," said the publisher, Khoi Nguyen,
from his newsroom above a hair salon in Westminster. "My policy is to
overcome the communists."</LD>
<TE>   His editorial mission is far from unique. Some 45 newspapers and
magazines, and roughly a dozen radio programs, fiercely compete to
serve Southern California's 300,000 Vietnamese Americans, most of
them in or near Orange County's Little Saigon. Some of these media
outlets have built loyal followings by fanning the flames of hatred
that many Vietnamese immigrants feel toward their homeland's
communist government.</TE>
<TE>   Papers such as Vietnam Tu Do ("Free Vietnam") not only criticize
Vietnam's government, but also take aim at those in Little Saigon who
the editors believe have communist leanings or who even tolerate
communism.</TE>
<TE>   To them, communist sympathizers and conspiracies abound. Activist
Steve Linh Nguyen (no relation to the publisher) was accused of
having communist ties because he organized walkathons that raised
money for victims of flooding in Vietnam. Several Little Saigon
musicians were branded traitors for taking their acts on tour in
Vietnam. A Westminster city councilman was accused of taking
clandestine trips to Vietnam that he insists never occurred.</TE>
<TE>   Some Embarrassment</TE>
<TE>   Some in Little Saigon, especially younger people, express
embarrassment about the level of journalism.</TE>
<TE>   To them, the papers practice a brand of redbaiting that has long
divided Little Saigon. They say such a slant makes it more difficult
for the community to move beyond the Vietnam War and deal with more
contemporary issues, such as poverty and crime.</TE>
<TE>   "When there's a person who takes a leadership role, they get
discredited in the media," said Phu Nguyen, 25 (also no relation),
head of a Vietnamese student group who in recent months has been
branded a communist on a radio show. "No one wants to take [a
leadership] position. They want to step back. It contributes to why
we don't have a dynamic unifying leader."</TE>
<TE>   Vietnam Tu Do, along with other weeklies such as the Vietnam Post
and Lap Truong ("Principle"), are the most stridently anti-communist.
The news racks also contain several newspapers published by former
political prisoners, which are favorites of exiles who spent time in
Vietnamese reeducation camps. At night, Vietnamese-language hosts in
the mold of Rush Limbaugh and Bill O'Reilly take to the airwaves,
leasing air time on half a dozen radio call-in shows punctuated by
anti-communist rhetoric.</TE>
<TE>   The target audience is first-generation immigrants with limited
language skills and seemingly unlimited contempt for communism.</TE>
<TE>   The Vietnamese-language media have an unusual ability to mobilize
the public. In 1999, the owner of a video store in Little Saigon
placed a communist Vietnamese flag and a picture of Ho Chi Minh, the
late North Vietnamese leader reviled by many immigrants, inside his
shop.</TE>
<TE>   The anti-communist media pounced on the story and helped spark a
53-day demonstration in front of the store that drew international
attention. At its height, 20,000 people converged on the Bolsa Avenue
strip mall, forcing police in riot gear to close off streets and keep
order.</TE>
<TE>   Few people can better attest to the power of the Little Saigon
press than Tony Lam. He made national headlines in 1992 when he was
elected to the Westminster City Council, becoming the first
Vietnamese American elected to public office in the United States.</TE>
<TE>   The English-language media hailed him as a trailblazer with a
Horatio Alger story. He immigrated to the United States in 1975, part
of a wave of refugees reaching Camp Pendleton after the fall of
Saigon. To support his family, he pumped gas, stocked groceries and
sold life insurance before opening a successful restaurant in Garden
Grove.</TE>
<TE>   But the Vietnamese-language press took a more skeptical view.
Within a few years, he was a favorite target of some weekly papers,
which accused him of everything from cheating on his wife to treason.</TE>
<TE>   By 1999, Lam was regularly labeled a communist sympathizer and
even an agent for the Vietnamese government. Several newspapers said
Lam gave a general from the Vietnam military a tour of Little Saigon,
which Lam insists never occurred.</TE>
<TE>   Lam, 66, blames the local Vietnamese media for turning people
against him. "They attack me all the time," Lam said. "I'm sick and
tired of it. They think this is a country of democracy, but they
don't understand that there are certain limits. They just continue to
pound people." He said there is little he can do to fight back.
Because he is a public figure, it would be difficult to win a
defamation suit with the heavy burden of proof.</TE>
<TE>   Lam, who took office with a goal of bringing his community
together, now says his high profile exacted a heavy price, and he
announced in August that he would not seek reelection.</TE>
<TE>   A Shoestring Crusade</TE>
<TE>   The newsroom of Vietnam Tu Do fills a cramped space above a
shopping plaza in the heart of Little Saigon. Khoi Nguyen is the
founder, publisher, editor and advertising manager of the free
weekly.</TE>
<TE>   Puffing on a cigarette as he thumbs through a recent edition,
Nguyen, 68, makes no apologies for his crusading.</TE>
<TE>   "I want to overturn the communists."</TE>
<TE>   Vietnam Tu Do is basically a two-person operation: Nguyen, who
uses the pen name Duy Sinh, edits the stories and sells the
advertising, while his wife, a cosmetologist by day, designs the
pages at night.</TE>
<TE>   He relies on a network of stringers, including a supermarket
checker (who alerted him to the communist Vietnamese flag inside the
video store), a postal worker and several retirees. Nguyen hasn't
been afraid to go after people he suspects of communist leanings or
corruption.</TE>
<TE>   His paper labeled community activist Tuan Anh Ho a "returnee," in
essence a communist sympathizer.</TE>
<TE>   Vietnam Tu Do also alleged that Ho assaulted a woman, threatened
to kill a man and "robbed his country's people." This prompted a war
of words between Vietnam Tu Do and Ho's own newspaper, Lap Truong,
which said Nguyen "worked for the cheapest and dirtiest newspaper."
The case eventually made its way to court -- one of more than a dozen
defamation suits filed against Little Saigon newspapers in the last
few years.</TE>
<TE>   It fell to Orange County Superior Court Judge Robert Gardner to
sort out the charges and countercharges involving four newspapers and
a radio station.</TE>
<TE>   After three years of wrangling, Gardner ruled in favor of Ho,
ordering the other papers to pay him $25,000. But his sharply worded
opinion took everyone to task.</TE>
<TE>   "The output of each of the four newspapers ... reeks with
irresponsible diatribe," Gardner wrote.</TE>
<TE>   "Each of them as an editor of a newspaper is an acute
embarrassment to the world of responsible press. Their writing as
reflected in this case has reduced it to the status of dismal
vulgarity."</TE>
<TE>   Nguyen is unrepentant.</TE>
<TE>   "To do business like the way I want, it is bad business," he said.
"I do it for others to listen to my ideology. I hope my work ...
influences people so we can rebuild our homeland."</TE>

<HD>Water Proposal Puts U.S. Mediator in Spotlight</HD>
<DH>Deadline nears for agreement to shift state's Colorado
River surplus from farms to cities.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Elizabeth Shogren</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Bennett Raley, a slow-talking Coloradan in cowboy boots, has his
hands on the faucet that sends water from the Colorado River to
Southern California. He seems ready and willing to shut it off, which
is scaring the cities and infuriating the farms that are competing
for the precious resource.</LD>
<LD>   Southern California's urban waterworks and rural irrigation
districts are trying to agree on a formula for weaning themselves
from the extra Colorado River water the state has been using beyond
its historic allotment. That means a reduction of 15% to 20% by 2016.</LD>
<LD>   As the Bush administration's assistant Interior secretary for
water and science, Raley promises to enforce a Judgment Day of Dec.
31. If the water systems reach agreement by then, the surplus they
now rely on will dry up at a manageable pace over 15 years.</LD>
<TE>   If they don't, it could disappear overnight -- and a new dispute
will erupt over how to divvy up the smaller amount.</TE>
<TE>   The loss of the Colorado River surplus water in 2003 would likely
result in a serious water shortage for the region, particularly if
the current dry spell turns into a prolonged drought.</TE>
<TE>   On the table is a complex deal that would transfer water from
Imperial Valley farms to urban users in San Diego County. The
transfer, if approved, would help reduce the overall amount of water
the region takes from the Colorado.</TE>
<TE>   But the Imperial Irrigation District has yet to approve the
transfer, which would pay farmers $258 to $400 per acre-foot of water
-- they pay only $15.50 per acre-foot -- and have them fallow up to
30,000 acres of land each year.</TE>
<TE>   As many farmers see it, the deal would enrich a few but ruin the
area's rural economy and agrarian way of life.</TE>
<TE>   Those who would like to see the transfer are putting their faith
in Raley, who combines the power of Washington with a rural
sensibility.</TE>
<TE>   "It takes somebody bigger than us to look at the situation and
resolve it," said Ron Gastelum, president and chief executive of the
Los Angeles-based Metropolitan Water District, which supplies water
to almost 18 million people in Southern California. "Real leadership
will have to come to the table."</TE>
<TE>   But Raley, guided by the administration's philosophy that the
states should solve their own problems, says he won't use his
authority to impose a deal. "It is up to California," Raley said in
an interview. "We're going to give them maximum opportunity to come
to their own solutions."</TE>
<TE>   Failing that, he said, Interior Secretary Gale Norton will enforce
"the law of the river."</TE>
<TE>   By decree of the U.S. Supreme Court, the Interior secretary is the
"water master" of the Colorado River and has the right to solve most
disputes between the seven Western states that divert water from the
Colorado.</TE>
<TE>   Because California has taken more than its fair share of the river
for so many years, the other six states have been pressuring federal
officials to rein in California now rather than later.</TE>
<TE>   But the cities' unhappiness is nothing compared with that of the
rural irrigation districts. Curiously, they complain that Raley, his
background notwithstanding, is biased against them.</TE>
<TE>   Raley, 46, says it's preposterous to call him biased against rural
interests. He grew up outside the tiny town of Norwood, Colo., which
was about 60 miles from the closest street light. His first job was
herding sheep for a local rancher when he was 11.</TE>
<TE>   Years later, as a water lawyer in private practice, he represented
a Colorado irrigation district in a dispute with an urban water
system over water rights. And now he represents an administration
whose political base is largely rural and suburban America.</TE>
<TE>   A rancher's jacket, rather than a trench coat, hangs from the
coatrack in his Washington, D.C., office. The room is full of
furniture that Raley built with his own hands -- a desk, several
tables, chests and picture frames.</TE>
<TE>   His favorite family vacations are backpacking and fly fishing in
Wyoming or camping on the beach on Washington's Olympic Peninsula.
Even his posture suggests his rural roots. When the conversation
turns intense, he props his elbows on his lanky, widespread legs.</TE>
<TE>   "I understand the fears of Imperial Valley, very much so," Raley
said.</TE>
<TE>   Andy Horne, one of the commissioners of the Imperial Irrigation
District, is well aware of Raley's roots.</TE>
<TE>   "I would have assumed that Mr. Raley, given his background, would
have more sympathy for agricultural water use," Horne said. "But it
seems like he has unfairly laid the burden of this deal on Imperial
Irrigation District's doorstep, when it is the urban water agencies
that have created the overdraft."</TE>
<TE>   Before signing on to any deal, the Imperial Irrigation District
wants assurances from Raley that the federal government will not take
any more water away from the valley, as it has threatened to do in
the past, on grounds that Imperial is not using the resource
efficiently.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of that depends on Mr. Raley," Horne said. "If he doesn't
give us the assurances before the end of the year, we will not sign
this agreement, in my opinion."</TE>
<TE>   Raley has expressed no sympathy for what Imperial sees as its
plight. Water exchanges such as the one being considered in Southern
California are commonplace elsewhere in the West, he said. Besides,
the deal being offered is a good one.</TE>
<TE>   "I think [Imperial] should take it and run with it," Raley said.</TE>
<TE>   Raley did not make up the Dec. 31 deadline. He inherited it from
the past administration, which brokered a deal between California and
the six other states with rights to Colorado River water. That deal
allowed California to slowly ramp down its use of excess Colorado
River water over 15 years.</TE>
<TE>   The goal was to allow the huge state time to develop other water
sources and to become a more efficient consumer. One condition was
that the California agencies that compete for the water had to agree
on a plan by the end of this year.</TE>
<TE>   Raley makes no secret that the Imperial Irrigation District, the
only agency of four still resisting the proposed deal, will face
"enormous scrutiny" if it refuses to sign on. If it is determined
that any water is wasted, he said, changes will be made to the way
the water is allocated.</TE>
<TE>   One thing seems certain: The other six states that receive water
from the Colorado are not going to take the pressure off California.
Any sympathy they might have felt has withered in four years of
little rain.</TE>
<TE>   "At the end of a four-year drought, the patience in the other
states with a further slippage of deadlines is almost zero," Raley
said.</TE>
<TE>   Not all Californians who have dealt with Raley have been unhappy
with him. Assemblyman Bob Hertzberg (D-Sherman Oaks), former speaker
of the lower house, has nothing but praise.</TE>
<TE>   "He's taken a hard line, but that's the right thing to do, because
we've got a problem and we've got to solve it," said Hertzberg, who
moderated two months of negotiations that resulted in a tentative
agreement.</TE>
<TE>   Hertzberg, a partisan Democrat who said he is not accustomed to
praising Republicans, was one of several California officials who
lauded Raley and his team for their knowledge of water issues.</TE>
<TE>   "These guys get the water world," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Hertzberg also was surprised that despite all the talk of bad
blood between the Bush administration and California, there were no
tensions.</TE>
<TE>   "They've been great," he added. "I'm flabbergastedly happy about
it."</TE>

<HD>Dissent Growing Over Rancho Mission Viejo</HD>
<DH>Activists, landowners are increasingly at odds over
developing 23,000 acres in southern O.C.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Janet Wilson</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Whither Rancho Mission Viejo?</LD>
<LD>   Even as the owners of the historic ranch dance an elaborate tango
with government regulators to try to begin development of up to
14,000 homes, a groundswell of opposition is growing.</LD>
<LD>   More than 500 residents showed up at the latest "scoping" session,
at which more than a dozen or so maps were displayed with competing
visions of how to subdivide the largest parcel of undeveloped land
left in southern Orange County.</LD>
<TE>   Angry grandmothers, high school students, homemakers toting babies
and others rejected them all, vowing to stop the bulldozers by buying
the land outright if necessary.</TE>
<TE>   "It's sacred land, we all know that," said Molly Walsh, 28, a
lifelong resident of San Clemente, fighting tears as she spoke at the
Oct. 30 meeting in San Juan Capistrano held by the U.S. Fish and
Wildlife Service, Army Corps of Engineers, state Department of Fish
and Game, and the Orange County Planning and Development Services
Department.</TE>
<TE>   "Coming here tonight has made me sad, it has made me disgusted,
but it has also made me excited," she said. "Orange County is the
richest county in the world.... I think the solution is to buy the
land. But everybody has to do their part."</TE>
<TE>   Rancho Mission Viejo company officials bluntly rejected that
notion.</TE>
<TE>   "The ranch is not for sale, the ranch is not for sale, the ranch
is not for sale," said spokeswoman Diane Gaynor.</TE>
<TE>   At the heart of the debate is nearly 23,000 acres, including
cropland, rolling hills grazed by cattle, paving and cement quarries,
canyons filled with increasingly scarce coastal sage scrub and
300-year-old trees, and the last undammed watershed in Southern
California. At least seven endangered or threatened species call the
area home.</TE>
<TE>   The land stretches from the southern end of Coto de Caza to Camp
Pendleton in San Diego County, from the Cleveland National Forest to
San Onofre State Beach. For decades, hikers and Sunday drivers have
enjoyed the rural landscapes and dramatic open space stretching along
both sides of winding Ortega Highway, all of it part of Rancho
Mission Viejo.</TE>
<TE>   The ranch owners, including the family led by Dick O'Neill and
Tony Moiso and developers from Arizona, have offered to set aside
nearly two-thirds of the acreage as permanent open space, in exchange
for permission to build half a dozen communities similar to Ladera
Ranch and other planned communities.</TE>
<TE>   Along with federal, state and local regulators, they are trying to
implement an unprecedented series of concurrent approvals that would
win them exemptions from the Endangered Species Act, the Clean Water
Act and other project-by-project permit laws, while donating large
blocks of habitat.</TE>
<TE>   "It isn't easy, but I think if everyone recognizes that this is a
special opportunity, a unique opportunity, and recognizes the need to
seek balance and accommodate everyone's points of view, we can wind
up with something in this ... part of the world that hasn't been done
in any other location," said Dan Kelly, vice president of
governmental relations for the company.</TE>
<TE>   "The prospect of change is more difficult for some people than
others," he said. "What we prefer to focus on is that while there are
strong feelings about how we are all going to live here in Orange
County, how do we take advantage of the opportunity to plan this
place together?"</TE>
<TE>   Company spokeswoman Gaynor added: "We have a clear need for homes
in Orange County, we have a clear need for jobs, and we have a clear
need to protect the environment, so the key is, how do you balance
those and make it all fair?"</TE>
<TE>   But the prospect of more tract homes covering the hills is what is
galvanizing environmentalists and area residents. Everyone has a
concern, including the loss of mountain lions and the ability to see
stars at night.</TE>
<TE>   "There's a huge new mall proposed. Can't you just picture it?"
said Erin Sill, a Santa Margarita High School student. "But as a
spokesperson for the younger generation, I would like to see this
land preserved forever. Can't you just picture that?"</TE>
<TE>   Bill Corcoran, with the Los Angeles field office of the Sierra
Club, acknowledges the housing need but added: "Does [California]
need housing in some of its last, best natural open space? We need
housing near where people already live, near existing roads, near
existing job centers."</TE>
<TE>   Corcoran said he was shocked -- and delighted -- by the turnout at
the public meeting. Friends of the Foothills, a South County group
devoted to stopping the construction of the Foothill South toll road
through Rancho Mission Viejo land, sent out hundreds of postcards
reading "Stop the Sprawl" before the meeting, and members are keeping
up the battle.</TE>
<TE>   "This is democracy in action," Corcoran said. He and others say
there is money available in recently passed statewide Proposition 50
-- a $3.4-billion clean water bond, which provides funds for
protecting wetlands and water sheds -- as well as federal funds to
buy the land, if the owners can be persuaded to sell.</TE>
<TE>   But some environmentalists who have been pushing for a compromise
for years worry that drawing battle lines could torpedo any
reasonable deal.</TE>
<TE>   "The crowd was like an animal that night; it had a sense of its
own power," said Dan Silver, director of the Endangered Habitats
League. "I would love to work with the Rancho Mission Viejo company
and collaborate. But unless we can bring solutions, events may run
away with themselves.... I believe there's a win-win [solution] out
there for everyone."</TE>
<TE>   Silver wants a carefully negotiated Natural Communities
Conservation Plan -- a statewide version of federal land-swap
programs -- based on the best scientific surveys, with creeks and
other prime ecological resources preserved. That, in turn, would
limit development to less sensitive areas. Critics say the ranch's
proposed open space plan would bulldoze some of the rarest habitat.</TE>
<TE>   "But if [Rancho Mission Viejo's] position is in totality that the
land is not for sale, and if the conservation position is 'Don't give
an inch,' that's a train wreck. You're heading into a Bolsa Chica, an
Ahmanson Ranch, with long-term uncertainty, protracted litigation and
potentially a lose-lose situation for everyone."</TE>
<TE>   Proposed developments at Bolsa Chica, on the Orange County coast,
and Ahmanson Ranch in Ventura County near Los Angeles have been
stalled for years.</TE>
<TE>   Silver said that while he would like to see all the land
preserved, he is worried that valuable pieces could continue to be
lost by attrition.</TE>
<TE>   He noted that the 8,100-home Ladera development was supposed to be
part of the Rancho Mission Viejo reserve plan; instead, he said the
company won "temporary" permits from the wildlife service to kill
threatened gnatcatchers after company officials promised that they
would implement a plan for the rest of their land.</TE>
<TE>   Efforts to negotiate the land's fate have dragged on for a decade.
The company first requested a conservation plan in 1992. The
recession of the mid-1990s, extensive technical surveys and other
factors caused delays, company officials said.</TE>
<TE>   Silver said that ranch officials were concerned by the Irvine
Co.'s problems with the state Coastal Commission at its Crystal Cove
development, and decided that they should press for a Special Area
Management Plan to iron out problems with federally protected streams
and wetlands upfront, as well as the imperiled species issues.</TE>
<TE>   Jane Hendron, spokeswoman for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service
in Carlsbad, said that while the federal, state and local processes
were being done concurrently, a possible first nationwide, that
didn't mean they were all one process.</TE>
<TE>   "They're different trains leaving the station at the same time,
that's all," she said.</TE>
<TE>   The next move appears to be up to the regulators. Federal army
corps and wildlife officials have not released data about the
ecological resources on the land, but hope to do so soon. Next, a
land use task force convened by Orange County 5th District Supervisor
Tom Wilson will make recommendations, and competing proposals will be
winnowed. Combined federal and state environmental reports will be
completed, and formal public hearings will be held.</TE>
<TE>   Foes promise that those hearings will be packed. In the last year,
attendance at the informal sessions surged from about 100 to more
than 500, and a drumroll of e-mails and other organizing continues.</TE>

<LD>Staring down a courtroom full of truant teenagers, her badge pinned
where everyone could see it, Ventura County prosecutor Wendy
Macfarlane made it clear she won't tolerate ditching.</LD>
<LD>   "All of you are here today because there's an attendance problem,"
she said.</LD>
<LD>   But the deputy district attorney wasn't talking just to the
shirking students. She also wanted the parents in the room to get the
message.</LD>
<TE>   "We're equal-opportunity here; we can prosecute the parent and the
child. Both of you will get a ticket," Macfarlane said at a monthly
anti-truancy assembly at Ventura County Superior Court.</TE>
<TE>   The county is taking a more aggressive approach toward parents
than most California counties, reflecting a shift in its stand on
truancy. Rather than punishing only students for their absences,
parents and guardians are being held accountable and sometimes
jailed.</TE>
<TE>   Just three months into this new approach, prosecutors and school
officials say it is fixing a problem that drains money from schools
and condemns students to crime and poverty.</TE>
<TE>   The reason for the success is simple. "Parents don't like to get
in trouble, and kids don't want their parents to get in trouble,"
said Nancy Bradford, director of administrative support services for
Ventura Unified School District.</TE>
<TE>   The district attorney's office and the Student Attendance Review
Board have been teaming up since 1998 to use the threat of the law to
deter students from ditching school. But to get a minor to a court
hearing on a truancy citation can take as long as four months --
nearly half the school year, Macfarlane said. It is not an effective
deterrent.</TE>
<TE>   Now, a truant student's parent or guardian receives the citation
and, as with a parking ticket, has 30 days to pay the fine or contest
it.</TE>
<TE>   "It's an immediate response to the problem," Macfarlane said.</TE>
<TE>   Fines and court costs for truancy infractions range from $271 to
more than $1,300 for a third offense. The money will be returned to
schools to offset the state funding they lose when students are
absent.</TE>
<TE>   Since July, the district attorney's office has issued about 60
truancy citations to adults and 12 to students. In the previous
school year, 29 adults and 398 students were cited.</TE>
<TE>   California's education code requires children to be enrolled in
school from age 6 to 18, unless they have graduated from high school.
A student is truant if he misses three full days of school in one
school year without a valid excuse.</TE>
<TE>   Being late or absent for any 30-minute period on three occasions
also classifies a student as truant.</TE>
<TE>   The county Truancy Referral and Prosecution Program sends warning
letters to truant students and their parents, followed by a review by
the attendance board, and then fines and potential jail time for the
parents.</TE>
<TE>   "Get them to school to protect yourself," Macfarlane told parents
in court. She is one of two prosecutors who handle truancy cases.</TE>
<TE>   District attorneys throughout the state have assigned deputies in
recent years to combat truancy full time. It's an investment,
prosecutors say, that will lighten their caseload in years to come.</TE>
<TE>   "If we can keep kids in school, we are a lot less likely to see
them end up in gangs," said Santa Clara County Deputy Dist. Atty.
Lois Baer.</TE>
<TE>   Counties have devised varying programs to combat the same problem.
Los Angeles County will prosecute parents of elementary school
students but figures that by high school, rebellious teenagers are to
blame.</TE>
<TE>   To take their parents to court "really is adding insult to
injury," said Deputy Dist. Atty. Richard de la Sota.</TE>
<TE>   Even the prosecution of parents of younger students is infrequent,
he said.</TE>
<TE>   Orange County requires problem students and their parents to
appear in court each month to check on school attendance. The county
has only 30 active cases in its system, a prosecutor said.</TE>
<TE>   And in San Diego County, the common system of warning letters,
assemblies and separate courts for truancy includes incentives:
Schools give out pizza, doughnuts and ice pops on days when students
are more likely to ditch.</TE>
<TE>   Although Ventura County's focus is now on parents, students still
face penalties, including assigned community service, work study and
weekend classes. A truant student risks losing his or her work permit
and driver's license and can be barred from playing on school
athletic teams.</TE>
<TE>   Valid excuses for missing school include illness, medical
appointments, religious holidays, court appearances and funerals. But
Macfarlane assures students that she's wise to those kids whose
"Uncle Bob" dies every month.</TE>
<TE>   The district attorney's monthly presentations familiarize parents
with classes and counseling offered by school districts, police
departments and nonprofit organizations. The resources aim to help
parents regain the upper hand with their "strong-willed" children.</TE>
<TE>   Last month, Macfarlane offered parents her own advice for rousing
a child who doesn't get up in the morning to go to school: Fill a
bucket with ice-cold water and dump it on them.</TE>
<TE>   "Make sure it gets all over the bed, because there aren't many
people who will sleep in a cold, wet bed," she suggested.</TE>
<TE>   Looking over her son's attendance record, Virginia Lemos was
surprised to see how many classes he had missed at Adolfo Camarillo
High School.</TE>
<TE>   "I make sure he goes every morning and I pick him up," Lemos told
the school's attendance advisor. "How's he getting out of campus?"</TE>
<TE>   Hanging his head, the teenager, Jonah Howard, sounded a little
incredulous himself. "They've got cameras everywhere," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Both mother and son are thinking a military school might be good
for Jonah. Until then, Lemos will take time off work to accompany her
son to school.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm going all six periods -- to embarrass him," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Lemos and Jonah were among about 120 students and parents who came
to Ventura County's recent assembly. Others were turned away at the
courtroom door.</TE>
<TE>   The reason?</TE>
<TE>   They showed up late.</TE>

<KH>BUFFALO 38, MIAMI 21</KH>
<HD>Bad Weather Doesn't Bother Bledsoe at All</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>ORCHARD PARK, N.Y.</DL>
<LD>Drew Bledsoe overcame the elements and the Buffalo Bills overcame
Ricky Williams' best rushing performance.</LD>
<LD>   Shrugging off freezing temperature, Bledsoe passed for three
touchdowns and scored one on his own, sparking the Bills to a 38-21
victory over the Miami Dolphins on Sunday.</LD>
<LD>   It was enough to deal with the elements and Miami's Williams, who
set a Dolphin record with 228 yards rushing.</LD>
<TE>   The game began with a temperature of 25 degrees and ended in near
whiteout conditions as a heavy snow fell through most of the fourth
quarter.</TE>
<TE>   While the Dolphins have traditionally had trouble playing in
wintry conditions, the Bills and Bledsoe are much more accustomed.</TE>
<TE>   "I've played in cold weather for a long time now, since high
school," said Bledsoe, who grew up in central Washington, and played
college football at Washington State and spent his previous nine NFL
seasons with the New England Patriots. "It never has been a real
factor as far as throwing the ball. I've got big hands. I can throw
the ball."</TE>
<TE>   Bledsoe completed 15 of 27 passes for 306 yards, breaking the game
open by leading Buffalo on three consecutive touchdown drives in the
second half.</TE>
<TE>   It was a prolific turnaround for a once-sputtering offense that
produced 36 points in its previous three games. It was also a
historic performance.</TE>
<TE>   Buffalo's Eric Moulds, with 130 yards receiving, and Peerless
Price, with 93 yards, each surpassed the 1,000-yard receiving mark.
Travis Henry with 151 yards rushing, broke the 1,000-yard plateau. It
marked the first time three players on the same team have done so in
the same game.</TE>
<TE>   The Bills (6-6) ended a losing streak at three while jumping back
into the AFC East playoff race, moving within a game of the Dolphins,
who share the division lead with New England at 7-5.</TE>
<TE>   Dolphin quarterback Ray Lucas, making his sixth consecutive start
in place of injured Jay Fiedler, was six-of-11 passing for 40 yards
and a touchdown before he was injured early in the third quarter.</TE>
<TE>   Fiedler took over, but passed for only 15 yards, completing five
of nine with an interception. Third-stringer Sage Rosenfels finished
the game.</TE>
<TE>   Wannstedt said Fiedler will start when Miami plays host to Chicago
on Dec. 9.</TE>
<TE>   Lucas lost two fumbles against the Bills. In two games against
Buffalo this season, Lucas completed 19 of 44 passes for 205 yards,
with four interceptions and four lost fumbles.</TE>

<LD>Pepperdine (0-2) at Long Beach State (1-1), 7 p.m. KPLS-AM (830) --
These are not the easiest times for either team. Pepperdine's
6-foot-10 junior center, Will Kimble, may not play again after being
diagnosed with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, an excessive thickness of
the heart muscle. The Waves are also without injured 6-9 forward Glen
McGowan. Pepperdine is in the midst of a four-game swing against Big
West Conference opponents. Long Beach plays five games in the next 12
days.</LD>
<LD>   Morris Brown (1-2) at Fullerton (0-2), 7 p.m., KWRM-AM (1370) --
It's early, but this could be a defining week for Fullerton, which
also plays host to Pepperdine on Wednesday and visits Loyola
Marymount on Saturday. Since moving up to Division I last season,
Morris Brown is 5-27.</LD>

<HD>In His View, Arnie, Bear Could End Augusta Flap</HD>

<LD>The flap over women and Augusta National Golf Club keeps growing and
some media members have suggested that prominent players such as
Tiger Woods should pressure Augusta by threatening to boycott the
Masters if no female members are admitted.</LD>
<LD>   Ian O'Connor of USA Today says that a couple of other prominent
golfers might make more headway should they take a stand because they
are members of the Georgia club.</LD>
<LD>   "Arnold Palmer and Jack Nicklaus can make this mess disappear
faster than a two-foot birdie putt," O'Connor writes.</LD>
<TE>   "So Palmer should quit playing the abdicating King, and Nicklaus
the dancing Bear.... Don't ask a black kid to suspend his pursuit of
history at a club with racist roots and sexist codes before you ask
two white legends to quit paying dues to that very club."</TE>
<TE>   Trivia time: The 1973 PGA Tour Q-school medalist has won 19 times
on the PGA Tour during his career -- the most by any Q-school
medalist. Who is he?</TE>
<TE>   And the runner-up is: Even under revised eligibility criteria
announced last week, Greg Norman, Tom Lehman, Mark Calcavecchia, Paul
Azinger and Jesper Parnevik currently do not qualify for the 2003
Masters.</TE>
<TE>   That group has combined for 13 top-five finishes, including five
runner-up finishes: Norman in 1986, 1987 and 1996; Calcavecchia in
1988 and Lehman in 1994.</TE>
<TE>   Looks like second place is wide open for Phil Mickelson.</TE>
<TE>   Get in line: After the overtime coin flip gaffe by Detroit Lion
Coach Marty Mornhinweg, Steve Rosenbloom of the Chicago Tribune
believes Mornhinweg might have a future as T.J. Simers' son-in-law:
"I'm thinking Marty Mornhinweg goes from taking the wind or the ball
to asking, 'Paper or plastic?' "</TE>
<TE>   Doh! Three burglars were arrested in Winsted, Conn., and charged
with trying to sell a stolen baseball autographed by Jackie Robinson.</TE>
<TE>   Two facts thwarted their plan:</TE>
<TE>   First, they stole the ball, appraised at $10,000, from the home of
Winsted Mayor John Forrest.</TE>
<TE>   Second, they tried to sell it to an undercover policeman.</TE>
<TE>   No need for martyrs: Scott Ostler of the San Francisco Chronicle
has some advice for the law enforcement officers assigned to defend
goalposts after college football games: "We appreciate your courage
and sense of duty. However, if you are faced with a stampeding crowd
of 5,000 drunken frat twits, run.</TE>
<TE>   "That's a goalpost, not the Alamo."</TE>
<TE>   Trivia answer: Ben Crenshaw.</TE>
<TE>   And finally: At a charity fund-raiser hosted by New England
Patriot linebacker Willie McGinest on Friday night at Revere, Mass.,
many in attendance were in the giving mood ... giving punches, that
is.</TE>
<TE>   About 40 police officers broke up a brawl at the "Thanksgiving
Jam."</TE>
<TE>   Police said about 300 of the 1,000 people in attendance were
involved, though there were no serious injuries and McGinest was not
involved.</TE>
<TE>   Oh yeah, this was the second time in the last four years the
charity event has ended in violence.</TE>
<TE>   Nothing like the good ol' holiday spirit.</TE>

<HD>Tomlinson Does Real Footwork</HD>
<DH>After reprieve from Elam, Christie's kick beats Broncos,
30-27, in overtime, but Charger rusher is difference.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Sam Farmer</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>SAN DIEGO</DL>
<LD>The feet of their two kickers got the San Diego Chargers into trouble
Sunday, and the feet of LaDainian Tomlinson bailed them out.</LD>
<LD>   Tomlinson rushed for a career-best 220 yards and three touchdowns,
tearing through Denver's top-ranked run defense with remarkable ease.
It was his relentless running that set up the winning field goal in
overtime -- a 27-yard kick by Steve Christie that clinched a 30-27
victory and first place in the AFC West.</LD>
<LD>   "Every time he touched the ball he made something happen," Charger
quarterback Drew Brees said of Tomlinson, whose performance came two
months after the Bronco defense slapped the Denver boot on him,
limiting him to 48 yards in 14 carries.</LD>
<TE>   It was the third overtime victory of the season for the Chargers
(8-4), matching an NFL record set by last season's 49ers, the only
other team to go 3-0 in overtime games.</TE>
<TE>   "The way I feel right now is: I kind of expected it," said Brees,
who earlier orchestrated overtime victories over San Francisco and
Oakland. "I think in the locker room everyone is excited, but I don't
think everyone is as excited as when we beat the 49ers, or maybe when
we beat the Chiefs, or even when we beat Oakland. We've been in these
situations, and we're kind of just starting to expect it."</TE>
<TE>   This time, Tomlinson made up for the miscues of San Diego kickers
Christie and Wade Richey. Christie missed three field goal attempts,
including one near the end of regulation and one that was blocked in
overtime. Richey, whose role has dwindled to kickoff specialist, was
repeatedly shallow on his kickoffs, and, in the second quarter,
enabled the Broncos to start a scoring drive on the 40-yard line by
booting the ball out of bounds.</TE>
<TE>   But it was the block in overtime that felt to the Chargers like a
swift kick in the gut. They had battled back from a 10-0 deficit with
a 24-point second quarter. They had buried the memory of a
humiliating 30-3 loss to Miami a week earlier. They were on the verge
of a monumental victory, one that would let them control their own
playoff destiny. The crowd of 66,357 was on its feet ...</TE>
<TE>   And, with a stomach-turning thud, a low, 38-yard attempt was
batted back in Christie's face.</TE>
<TE>   The Broncos (7-5) pounced on the ball -- the kick was attempted on
third down -- and seized the momentum. Eight plays later, they were
lining up for their own game-clincher, an attempt of 53 yards by
Jason Elam, normally on target in those pressure situations.</TE>
<TE>   "He's pretty accurate, so I was thinking, 'Man, we blew our
opportunity,' " Tomlinson said. "I thought for sure he was going to
make that field goal."</TE>
<TE>   But Elam's kick fluttered wide left, and the Chargers had another
chance. They responded by putting the ball back in the hands of
Tomlinson, who rushed for 57 yards in the overtime. Other Chargers
made big contributions on the winning drive -- Reche Caldwell caught
a pass for 11 yards, Stephen Alexander caught one for 20 -- but
Tomlinson had six carries in the final eight plays. His feet still
dabbed at the turf like sewing-machine needles. His cuts still left
Denver players hugging the air.</TE>
<TE>   "His cuts look premeditated because they look so smooth," Brees
marveled. "You just say, wow, that's the only place he could have
gone and he went there. But it's feel. That's why he's one of the
best in the league."</TE>
<TE>   Tomlinson is the league's second-leading rusher with 1,318 yards,
four yards behind Kansas City's Priest Holmes.</TE>
<TE>   Denver was limiting opponents to 72.7 yards rushing a game, a mark
Tomlinson surpassed with one run on the final play of the first
quarter. He took a handoff and burst around the left side, dashing
down the Bronco sideline for 76 yards before being caught at the six
by Tyrone Poole, who was flagged for a personal foul on the tackle
for latching onto the running back's face mask and nearly twisting
off his helmet. Tomlinson scored from the three on the next play.</TE>
<TE>   Tomlinson scored on San Diego's next two possessions, showing
astounding strength on a five-yard touchdown run by powering the
final three yards with linebacker Ian Gold draped across his back.</TE>
<TE>   Bracketing the three Tomlinson scoring runs were touchdowns by
Denver rookie Clinton Portis, whose performance was overshadowed even
though he gained 159 yards in 23 carries.</TE>
<TE>   "All those yards are no good when you lose," Portis said.</TE>
<TE>   The division race is far from over, of course. The Chargers play
host to the Raiders on Sunday, and that showdown will be even more
meaningful if Oakland (7-4) beats the New York Jets tonight.</TE>
<TE>   The Chargers will be without starting defensive tackle Jamal
Williams, who suffered a dislocated ankle in Sunday's game and is
done for the season. More than one San Diego player believes the
injury came as a result of a cheap shot by a Denver player.</TE>
<TE>   "They have that reputation of cheap shots," San Diego defensive
end Marcellus Wiley said. "And I don't think today helped them any."</TE>

<HD>Chief Victory Is No Contest</HD>

<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>KANSAS CITY, Mo.</DL>
<LD>Whether it was the worst, second-worst or 10th-worst loss in their
team's history hardly mattered to the glassy-eyed players in the
Arizona dressing room.</LD>
<LD>   "I don't know if that makes it any more frustrating," Cardinal
defensive end Kyle Vanden Bosch finally said. "It just doesn't get
any more frustrating."</LD>
<LD>   The Kansas City Chiefs, with a defense ranked last in the NFL,
shut out the injury-weakened Cardinals, 49-0, Sunday. It's believed
to be the most lopsided loss for a franchise that has played in three
different cities, and in parts of three different centuries. It also
was the biggest margin in the NFL since the Cincinnati Bengals beat
the Houston Oilers, 61-7, on Dec. 17, 1989.</LD>
<TE>   "You've got to feel bad for those guys," Chief guard Brian Waters
said.</TE>
<TE>   Dante Hall had a team-record 90-yard punt return for a touchdown
for the Chiefs (6-6), who handed the Cardinals (4-8) with their sixth
consecutive loss.</TE>
<TE>   Kansas City's Priest Holmes scored two touchdowns and had 169
total yards, personally eclipsing the 122 net yards of the Cardinals.</TE>
<TE>   Jake Plummer, who threw three of the four Cardinal interceptions,
was replaced late in the third quarter by Josh McCown.</TE>
<TE>   The Cardinals' previous worst loss was on Oct. 12, 1941, when the
Chicago Cardinals lost to the Chicago Bears, 53-7. Records aren't
available between 1898, when the Cardinals were founded, and 1920.</TE>
<TE>   "Any time you've got a one-sided loss like that, it has to go
directly to the head coach," said Arizona Coach Dave McGinnis. "And
that's exactly what I told my players."</TE>
<TE>   It was the second-most lopsided victory for the Chiefs, behind
only their 59-7 victory over Denver on Sept. 7, 1963.</TE>

<DH>Olowokandi joins injured list, and Miller also misses 92-87
loss to Pacers.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Elliott Teaford</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>There's no news like Clipper news these days.</LD>
<LD>   It's all bad, all the time.</LD>
<LD>   Center Michael Olowokandi was the latest to fall, placed on the
injured list Sunday because the tendinitis in his left knee that
sidelined him for most of training camp has flared up again. He must
sit out five games, which means he won't be eligible to play again
until Dec. 11.</LD>
<TE>   Olowokandi made a brief appearance at Staples Center, meeting with
Dr. Tony Daly, the team physician, to discuss treatment. Rest is the
only cure, Daly said. Olowokandi did not sit with his teammates on
the bench during the Clippers' 92-87 loss to the Indiana Pacers and
was not immediately available for comment.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the Clippers also will be without point guard Andre
Miller for an unspecified period. Miller sprained his left ankle in a
collision with Sacramento guard Bobby Jackson during a loss to the
Kings on Friday and could not play Sunday against the Central
Division-leading Pacers.</TE>
<TE>   As he limped from the arena after the Clippers' 12th loss in 18
games, Miller termed his status "day-to-day."</TE>
<TE>   Sunday was not the day, and in more ways than one.</TE>
<TE>   Playing without Olowokandi, Miller and Corey Maggette, who until
he had arthroscopic knee surgery Friday had been filling in for the
injured Lamar Odom at small forward, the Clippers missed their first
11 shots.</TE>
<TE>   They would rally from a nine-point deficit with an inspired
second-half run. They built a 73-66 lead after two free throws by
Elton Brand with 6:41 left in the game capped a 10-2 run. Brand would
finish with 20 points and 12 rebounds in 40 minutes. Marko Jaric had
a career-best 25 points.</TE>
<TE>   The Clippers' lead and momentum would not last. They were ahead,
82-78, after Eric Piatkowski's three-point basket with 3:34 left. But
Indiana's Reggie Miller scored 10 of his team's final 14 points,
including the go-ahead basket after a Clipper turnover and a 22-foot
jump shot that gave the Pacers an 88-85 lead.</TE>
<TE>   Keyon Dooling missed a three-pointer from the left wing with 4.3
seconds left with the Clippers down, 90-87. Ron Mercer made two free
throws after the Clippers were forced to foul to account for the
final score.</TE>
<TE>   "That wasn't the play we drew up," Coach Alvin Gentry said when
asked about Dooling's one-on-one move with plenty of time still on
the clock. Asked what play he had designed, Gentry said, "It doesn't
matter now."</TE>
<TE>   Gentry referred medical questions to others.</TE>
<TE>   Daly said Olowokandi was suffering from "bad tendinitis," and
Miller's ankle "doesn't seem bad -- not like Lamar's or Keyon's."</TE>
<TE>   Odom has been sidelined by a sprained right ankle since August.
Dooling sat out most of last season because of a sprained right
ankle.</TE>
<TE>   Olowokandi has undergone two MRI exams, with another scheduled
today.</TE>
<TE>   "Just covering all the bases," Daly said. "It seems like when he
gets back to normal, it kicks up again. He can't jump."</TE>
<TE>   Olowokandi's play suffered recently. He averaged 10.3 points (down
from his season average of 14.1) on 12-for-31 shooting in the last
three games. He had six points and seven rebounds in 25 minutes
Friday against Sacramento.</TE>
<TE>   Still, the severity of Olowokandi's injury came as a surprise to
at least one teammate.</TE>
<TE>   "I was shocked," Piatkowski said of arriving at Staples Center and
learning of Olowokandi's placement on the injured list Sunday
morning. "I didn't have any idea Michael was hurting like that. And I
didn't know Andre wasn't starting until we went out for
introductions."</TE>
<TE>   Piatkowski took his customary position as the team's shooting
guard, but with the exception of Brand at power forward, the Clipper
starting lineup had a dramatically different look to it.</TE>
<TE>   Jaric, a rookie from Yugoslavia, started for Miller at point
guard. Melvin Ely, a rookie playing in his third NBA game, replaced
Olowokandi. Quentin Richardson took Jaric's spot as the small
forward.</TE>
<TE>   The Clippers activated forward Tremaine Fowlkes from the injured
list to take Olowokandi's spot on the roster.</TE>
<TE>   "We played some players that haven't played much this season,"
Jaric said. "We played really hard with a big heart, but because of
the experience of the Indiana players, they won."</TE>

<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Ever the optimist, Clipper shooting guard Eric Piatkowski took the
only positive spin he could find from Sunday's loss to the Indiana
Pacers and ran with it.</LD>
<LD>   "I thought we played good basketball," he said of the Clippers'
92-87 defeat, in which they were outscored, 10-4, in the final three
minutes. "The game came down to one or two possessions. We were right
there at the end, but they won. There's a reason why they were 13-2
coming into the game.</LD>
<LD>   "But we're going to get over the hump. I'm positive of that."</LD>
<TE>   Piatkowski blamed himself for running to the wrong spot on the

<LD>   What: "The Mighty Johns"</LD>
<LD>   Author: David Baldacci</LD>
<TE>   Publisher: New Millennium Press</TE>
<TE>   Price: $23.95</TE>
<TE>   "The Mighty Johns" is a 92-page novella in a 316-page hardcover
book that also includes 13 other short stories, all mysteries with
football used as the backdrop. On the book jacket is this quote
attributed to Publisher's Weekly about David Baldacci's story: "One
of the most remarkable stories ever written."</TE>
<TE>   Maybe we missed something. It's not a bad story, but it's
overwritten and hard to follow.</TE>
<TE>   The main character is Tor North, a lineman for the Draven
University Mighty Johns who is also a brilliant student of physics.
He solves a 40-year-old mystery -- the disappearance of Mighty Johns'
star Herschel Ruggles, who was never seen again after scoring a
record-setting touchdown and running on into the locker room.</TE>
<TE>   There are twists to the plot that keep the reader going but
Baldacci's prose tends to be wordy and convoluted. North's job of
blocking on a kickoff return is described this way: "As Newton's Law
of Motion dictated with a majestic certainty, when an object exerts a
force on a second object, the second object exerts an equal and
opposite force on the first."</TE>
<TE>   One of the 13 additional short stories, "Whatever It Takes to
Win," is written by Tim Green, a former NFL defensive end and current
Fox football commentator who has written several novels. As usual,
Green is writing about the NFL's underbelly. His story involves
murder, the mob and stealing electronic play-calling signals.</TE>
<TE>   This is the third New Millennium sports anthology edited by
mystery guru Otto Penzler. The first was the baseball-themed
"Murderers Row," followed by the boxing-themed "Murder on the Ropes."</TE>

<HD>Northridge Turns the Tables</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Mike Bresnahan</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Ian Boylan remembers the embarrassment against Howard last year -- an
awful loss on a drab, rainy November night in Washington where
nothing went right for Cal State Northridge in the lowest point of a
disappointing season.</LD>
<LD>   A year later, a year wiser, on a team with a better outlook,
Boylan scored 23 points and Northridge defeated Howard, 101-80, in a
nonconference men's basketball game Sunday before 1,008 at
Northridge.</LD>
<LD>   After losing to Howard last season by 34 points, easily the worst
loss in Coach Bobby Braswell's seven years at Northridge, the
Matadors put away the Bison early, leading by as many as 24 in the
first half before coasting the rest of the way.</LD>
<TE>   "Remembering what happened last year and what could happen if we
didn't come to play stayed in my mind," said Boylan, a sophomore
swingman who made nine of 12 shots.</TE>
<TE>   As if the Matadors needed a reminder, Braswell showed the team
what he called a five-minute "lowlight" video from last year's game
after Saturday's practice.</TE>
<TE>   "It was hard watching it," said senior forward Lionel Benjamin,
who had 13 points. "All the turnovers, all the missed rebounds, all
their put-backs.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought we were done [with practice] and then they popped this
tape in and all heads went down."</TE>
<TE>   The victory was another good sign for the Matadors (2-2), who
trailed No. 9 Oregon by two points with two minutes to play Nov. 25
before losing, 86-77.</TE>
<TE>   The Matadors have already bettered last year's 1-7 start, which
turned into a disappointing 12-16 season a year after their first
appearance in the NCAA tournament.</TE>
<TE>   Kyle Williams had 21 points for Howard (1-2).</TE>

<HD>Ducks Avert Late Collapse</HD>
<DH>They score their goals in the first seven minutes but have
to hang on for a 3-2 victory over Blackhawks at the Pond.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Chris Foster</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Keith Carney was going to grab that guy.</LD>
<LD>   Steve Rucchin was going to win that faceoff.</LD>
<LD>   Niclas Havelid was going to win that battle in the corner.</LD>
<TE>   Kurt Sauer was going to fire that puck as hard as he could up the
ice.</TE>
<TE>   The Mighty Ducks did the right things at the right moment to avert
explaining another late-game collapse. A lesson that came cheap
enough in a 3-2 victory over the Chicago Blackhawks on Sunday in
front of an announced 12,493 at the Arrowhead Pond.</TE>
<TE>   "We need to have a little bit more composure," Rucchin said.
"We're definitely getting a lot of experience for that."</TE>
<TE>   There is value in a win like this ... especially when you get the
win. The Ducks had ties in their three previous games, but let
two-goal third-period leads get away in two of them. So holding on
Sunday was worth the pain, in hindsight.</TE>
<TE>   "This was a little step," Rucchin said. "This will help us to be
better. Still, we can't let a team back in a game like that."</TE>
<TE>   The Ducks spent the first seven minutes in hockey heaven and the
next 53 a little farther south.</TE>
<TE>   Paul Kariya, Marc Chouinard and Patric Kjellberg scored the three
fastest goals to start a game in franchise history. All it got them
was a one-goal lead at the end of the period.</TE>
<TE>   "We got comfortable," defenseman Fredrik Olausson said.</TE>
<TE>   The uncomfortable moments continued down to the end.</TE>
<TE>   With 12 seconds left, Chicago's Eric Daze nearly broke in alone on
goalie Jean-Sebastien Giguere. So defenseman Keith Carney hooked him,
taking the penalty.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know if he was going to get a shot off," Carney said.
"But, yeah, I'd do that every time."</TE>
<TE>   That left the Blackhawks, who had pulled their goalie, with a
two-man advantage and the faceoff in the Duck end. Rucchin won the
draw. Havelid dug the puck out of the corner. Sauer flung it up ice
with some passion.</TE>
<TE>   "I just wanted that thing out of our end, take the two points and
go home," Sauer said.</TE>
<TE>   The need for that sort of scrappy play seemed unnecessary at the
start. The Ducks broke from the gate quickly, with three goals on
their first four shots, then stumbled home.</TE>
<TE>   But a win is a win, of course, of course.</TE>
<TE>   "I can see it as a big win," Coach Mike Babcock said. "Don't get
me wrong, I would have liked us to keep playing the same way. I don't
know if you know this or not, but we're not used to having a big
lead."</TE>
<TE>   Babcock ended his postgame remarks abruptly.</TE>
<TE>   "It wasn't perfect hockey game by any means," he said. "We won.
See you guys."</TE>
<TE>   The Ducks scored three goals on their first four shots on goal,
then went into hibernation. They had only two shots on goal the next
20 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   The Ducks gave a 7-minute 24-second lesson on the NHL to Blackhawk
goalie and Chicago native Craig Andersson, who was making his first
NHL start. Andersson could only hope the relatives were late tuning
in Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   Stanislav Chistov sent a slick cross-ice pass that Kariya buried
for a power-play goal and a 1-0 lead 1:54 into the game. Marc
Chouinard pushed a rebound under Andersson for a 2-0 lead 24 seconds
later. Olausson then fired a shot that went off Kjellberg and into
the net for another power-play goal at 7:24.</TE>
<TE>   The air went out of the Duck balloon at that point.</TE>
<TE>   "There was no need for us to let up," Giguere said. "We can't give
them a chance to come back in a game like that. Their goalie was
making his first [start] in the NHL. He gave up three quick goals, we
got to keep shooting."</TE>
<TE>   A rather weak shot by Alexei Zhamnov hit Giguere on the glove,
popped in the air and fell into the goal at 18:12 of the first
period.</TE>
<TE>   Rookie Tony Arnason then flipped a loose puck into the goal to
make it 3-2 with 42 seconds left in the period.</TE>
<TE>   Chicago lost a goal when Jason Strudwick was called for goalie
interference and one when Nathan Dempsey was called for kicking the
puck into the net.</TE>
<TE>   "This was one of those sports lessons that you don't want to got
through and hopefully won't happen again," Olausson said.</TE>

<HD>Bruin Nation Could Be Ruination of the BCS</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>It's all up to you, Bob, and 90% of the free world is flying a Bruin
banner (Switzerland, what a surprise, is neutral).</LD>
<LD>   We know UCLA Coach Bob Toledo has enough headaches, what with
letter writers calling for his job in the wake of a two-year swoon in
which his team has gone 14-8, while cross-town rival Pete Carroll in
that same span has led USC to a stellar record of ... 16-8?</LD>
<LD>   Anyway, Bob, if you wouldn't mind, could you possibly next weekend
save your job and the bowl championship series?</LD>
<TE>   Saturday's matchup between UCLA and Washington State at the Rose
Bowl will be the most tuned-in Toledo game since that harrowing,
locker room-dividing 1998 defeat at Miami.</TE>
<TE>   USC is suddenly a bosom buddy because it needs a UCLA win to
clinch the Pacific 10 title and a Rose Bowl berth.</TE>
<TE>   The Rose Bowl wants UCLA to win so it can pair USC and Iowa in a
dream matchup (how does a Washington State-Colorado alternative grab
you?).</TE>
<TE>   And you don't know how badly the Orange Bowl wants UCLA to
prevail.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, a UCLA victory against Washington State can save the BCS
from potential mayhem -- hey, maybe that's not a bad thing.</TE>
<TE>   If UCLA defeats Washington State, the Orange Bowl's woes are
solved. If it loses No. 1 Miami to the Fiesta Bowl, the Orange Bowl
can, without guilt, take 10-2 Notre Dame and ensure a packed stadium.</TE>
<TE>   If UCLA wins, the Orange Bowl doesn't have to snub Iowa or USC,
which would meet in the Rose Bowl.</TE>
<TE>   If UCLA loses, well, look out.</TE>
<TE>   If Washington State goes to the Rose Bowl and USC secures an
automatic BCS at-large bid by getting to No. 4 in the BCS standings,
then maybe we're looking at this:</TE>
<TE>   The Orange Bowl, desperate for a team that will travel, passes on
USC and steals Iowa from the Rose Bowl. Notre Dame gets shoved out of
the BCS mix but has no real beef given how it was shoved out of the
Coliseum.</TE>
<TE>   The Rose Bowl, picking next, has to pass USC to the Sugar Bowl and
gets stuck with the Big 12 champion, either Oklahoma or Colorado.</TE>
<TE>   The Rose Bowl is not going to be happy about losing Iowa,
especially if it gets the bill for three-loss Colorado.</TE>
<TE>   If UCLA loses, and USC does not get the automatic bid, the Orange
Bowl might take Notre Dame over USC and let Iowa go to the Rose Bowl,
in which case USC is very, very upset.</TE>
<TE>   Among the few not rooting for UCLA: Washington State fans across
America and the Pac-10, which would lose $4.5 if the conference
places only one team in the BCS.</TE>
<TE>   The important thing for Toledo, though, is to relax and enjoy the
pageantry.</TE>
<TE>   Losers' Racket</TE>
<TE>   Florida State's win over Florida on Saturday saved the BCS the
embarrassment of sending a five-loss team to a major bowl game.</TE>
<TE>   Now it only has to live with the embarrassment of sending a
four-loss team to a BCS game.</TE>
<TE>   Florida State, at 9-4, is going to play in either the Sugar or
Orange Bowl at the expense of a more deserving school, possibly USC,
Kansas State, Iowa or even Texas.</TE>
<TE>   As champion of the Atlantic Coast Conference, Florida State is
guaranteed an automatic BCS berth.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, if Colorado and Arkansas win their conference title games
next week, the BCS will send three teams with three or more defeats
to major bowls.</TE>
<TE>   Not fair? Brace yourselves here, but this is all about money.</TE>
<TE>   When the BCS was formed in 1998, the major conference
commissioners determined it was imperative the champions of the six
major conferences received automatic exemptions so each league would
be assured of a major bowl payout.</TE>
<TE>   "There's nothing we can do," Pac-10 Commissioner Tom Hansen said
of the Florida State situation. "We have to have each conference
protected because of the money. That's the whole foundation of the
BCS."</TE>
<TE>   Most years, the best schools in the best conferences are among the
best teams that receive the eight BCS bowl spots.</TE>
<TE>   Not this year.</TE>
<TE>   "It's very unfortunate when that happens," Hansen said.</TE>
<TE>   There's a good reason why no BCS conference commissioner in his
right mind is going to push for a rule that would prohibit a three-
or four-loss conference champion from a BCS game.</TE>
<TE>   "It could be us next year," Hansen said.</TE>
<TE>   This is not the first time the BCS has sent a dud to the dance.</TE>
<TE>   In 1998, Syracuse won the Big East with three losses and a No. 15
BCS ranking, then got crushed by Florida in the Orange Bowl.</TE>
<TE>   The BCS then added an obscure rule that stated a conference that
didn't maintain a top-12 BCS average over a four-year period could
lose its major bowl guarantee.</TE>
<TE>   Now, no one with half a brain believed the so-called "Big East"
rule would ever be enforced, but, technically, Florida State has put
the ACC on the four-year clock.</TE>
<TE>   Weekend Wrap</TE>
<TE>   USC's chances look good for overtaking Iowa for the No. 4 spot in
today's BCS standings. The Trojans trailed Iowa by .94 last week, but
moved from No. 6 to No. 2 in two of the seven BCS computer polls and
from No. 3 to No. 1 in the New York Times computer. USC also gained a
half-point on Iowa in the poll component. Four BCS computer operators
embargo the release of their rankings until today, but the trends
suggest USC will leapfrog Iowa.</TE>
<TE>   Another note about the No. 4 finish: It applies only in the case
where an at-large team is bumped from the No. 3 spot by a conference
champion.</TE>
<TE>   For example, if Georgia lost next week and USC moved to No. 3 in
the BCS and Iowa took over the No. 4 spot, USC would get the
automatic BCS at-large berth but No. 4 Iowa would not.</TE>
<TE>   Two milestones could be in jeopardy next season. Coach John
Gagliardi, of Division III St. John's, earned his 399th career win
Saturday and is only 10 wins shy of breaking Eddie Robinson's record
of 408. Meanwhile, Miami is 15 wins from topping Oklahoma's major
college record or 47 straight victories. Miami could break the mark
if it finishes next season unbeaten.</TE>

<HD>Kings Will Receive Apology for 'Joke'</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Doug Moss, the Mighty Ducks' vice president of business operations,
said he would call King President Tim Leiweke today to apologize for
the inappropriate humor about King fans on the message board at the
Arrowhead Pond.</LD>
<LD>   During the Duck-King game Friday, a list of why King fans sit
together during games at the Pond included a tasteless joke that
angered King officials, including Coach Andy Murray.</LD>
<LD>   Moss said he has spoken to the person responsible.</LD>
<TE>   "It's all been addressed," Moss said. "You won't be seeing that
again, not even close. I want to do fun things, good-natured ribbing.
That's what we're going to do in the future.... I don't like bathroom
humor and I don't want to get personal. It has been made really clear
how we're going to go about this."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Ducks' Stanislav Chistov and Chicago's Tyler Arnason faced
each other for the first time Sunday. They began the game as the top
two rookie scorers in the NHL. They finished in the same spots.
Chistov had an assist and has 14 points. Arnason had a goal and has
15 points. He leads rookies with seven goals.... Defenseman Ruslan
Salei sat out because of back spasms. He is questionable for
Tuesday's game at Detroit.</TE>

<KH>PHILADELPHIA 10, ST. LOUIS 3</KH>
<HD>Eagles Don't Miss a Beat With Feeley</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>PHILADELPHIA</DL>
<LD>Backed by a dominant defense, the Philadelphia Eagles proved they can
win with their No. 3 quarterback. The St. Louis Rams still haven't
won without theirs.</LD>
<LD>   Bobby Taylor returned an interception 23 yards for a touchdown,
and third-string quarterback A.J. Feeley did just enough to help the
Eagles beat the Rams, 10-3, Sunday. The teams played in last season's
NFC championship game.</LD>
<LD>   The NFC East-leading Eagles (9-3) shut down St. Louis' once-potent
offense, forcing five turnovers and sacking Kurt Warner eight times,
including four by backup defensive end N.D. Kalu.</LD>
<TE>   "When we go out and play and there's no letdown in any quarter,
there's no team we can't beat," All-Pro safety Brian Dawkins said.</TE>
<TE>   Feeley, starting his first game since his junior season at Oregon
in 1999, completed 14 of 30 passes for 181 yards, and lost one
fumble. He played because Donovan McNabb is out with a broken right
ankle and Koy Detmer has a dislocated left elbow.</TE>
<TE>   "It felt great. It's been a long time since I played a whole
game," said Feeley, who started eight games his junior season, before
getting hurt and losing his job to Joey Harrington.</TE>
<TE>   Warner, the NFL most valuable player last season, was 20 for 42
for 218 yards and two interceptions. He also lost a fumble in the
first quarter, and lost nine yards when he dropped the ball on a pump
fake.</TE>
<TE>   The Rams (5-7), who beat the Eagles, 29-24, in the conference
title game in January, are 0-6 when Warner starts. They won five in a
row with No. 3 quarterback Marc Bulger as a starter after backup
Jamie Martin was injured in his first game playing for Warner, who
broke his pinkie in Week 4.</TE>
<TE>   "We made mistakes all across the board," said Warner, whose right
hand was wrapped in ice after the game. "In the past, we've always
been able to overcome it. For whatever reason this year, we haven't."</TE>

<KH>ATLANTA 30, MINNESOTA 24 (OT)</KH>
<HD>Victory Is All About Vick</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>MINNEAPOLIS</DL>
<LD>The Minnesota Vikings learned a lesson Sunday that NFL defenses would
be wise to learn quickly: Don't turn your back on Michael Vick.</LD>
<LD>   The Atlanta quarterback ran for a career-high 173 yards in 10
carries, including a spectacular 46-yard touchdown run in overtime
that gave the Falcons to a 30-24 victory over the Minnesota Vikings
on Sunday.</LD>
<LD>   Vick's rushing yardage was the most by a quarterback. Tobin Rote
had the previous high of 150 for Green Bay in 1951.</LD>
<TE>   On his game-winning run, Vick was flushed out of the pocket and
saw a Viking defender turn his back to cover a receiver. Vick
sprinted into open field, went through three defenders and then burst
past safety Ronnie Bradford.</TE>
<TE>   "When he turned his back, I just took off with it," said Vick, who
accounted for 346 of Atlanta's 379 yards. "It seems like I am a
running back too.</TE>
<TE>   "Coach [Dan] Reeves is always telling me, 'Get down, get down.'
But I wasn't seeing that. I was thinking end zone."</TE>
<TE>   The Falcons (8-3-1) are 7-0-1 since an Oct. 6 loss to Tampa Bay.
Vick, who rushed for two touchdowns and threw for another, struggled
at times, completing only 11 of 27 passes for 173 yards. He also had
an interception and two fumbles.</TE>
<TE>   But Vick got a chance to make up for those turnovers after Sam
Rogers sacked the Vikings' Daunte Culpepper on the on the first
overtime possession to force a punt.</TE>
<TE>   On the Falcons' second play, Vick dropped back, rolled left and
broke two tackles on his way to the score.</TE>
<TE>   "I just try to forget about all the bad plays and just move on to
the next play," Vick said. "You have to be strong mentally to be
successful."</TE>
<TE>   Added Reeves: "He certainly had bad plays today, but he just
didn't let it bother him.</TE>
<TE>   "I've never seen anyone turn on the jets like that."</TE>
<TE>   Culpepper completed 22 for 41 passes for 260 yards, getting one
touchdown passing and another running. But he was sacked six times
and threw three interceptions.</TE>
<TE>   The Vikings (3-9) lead the league with 35 turnovers, 26 by
Culpepper.</TE>
<TE>   With Minnesota trailing 24-21 on a third-and-15 situation just
before the two-minute warning, Culpepper heaved a pass to Randy Moss
for a 40-yard gain to the Atlanta 32.</TE>
<TE>   Then Moss, who caught nine passes for 134 yards, went into motion,
took a handoff and threw an apparent touchdown pass across the field
to Culpepper with 27 seconds left. But it was negated by an illegal
formation penalty.</TE>
<TE>   The Vikings settled for Gary Anderson's 29-yard field goal to tie
the score with 11 seconds left.</TE>

<HD>Dress To Thrill Does Just That</HD>
<DH>Well-traveled Irish filly's late charge beats  Golden
Apples by a head in the Matriarch at Hollywood Park.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Bill Christine</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>After a recent international hopscotch that had taken her about
15,000 miles, Dress To Thrill wasn't going to let another 40 yards
get in the way.</LD>
<LD>   Bearing down on horses that had run better than she did in a
different Breeders' Cup race in late October, Dress To Thrill and
jockey Patrick Smullen came from off the pace on the outside to beat
Golden Apples by a head in Sunday's $500,000 Matriarch at Hollywood
Park.</LD>
<LD>   Golden Apples, third in last year's Matriarch, had disposed of
favored Banks Hill in the stretch, but couldn't repel the Irish
filly's late charge.</LD>
<TE>   Although Dress To Thrill, completing 1 1/8 miles in 1:48 1/5 on a
damp course listed as firm, paid $16.60 as the fourth choice in a
six-horse field, she was no surprise for trainer Dermot Weld. He had
thrown out the 3-year-old filly's eighth-place finish in the
Breeders' Cup Mile at Arlington Park.</TE>
<TE>   "She delivered the goods today," said the 54-year-old Weld, who
has won more races than any trainer in Ireland. "The Breeders' Cup
was not a true reflection of her ability. The turf [at Arlington] was
very soft, and this is a mare who prefers firmer ground."</TE>
<TE>   Golden Apples, favored in the Breeders' Cup Filly &amp; Mare Turf, ran
fourth at Arlington, the first time she hadn't been first or second
in a race this year. Banks Hill, second to Starine in the Filly &amp;
Mare, was edged for third by Magic Mission on Sunday and was almost
two lengths back of Dress To Thrill. After the Matriarch, trainer Ben
Cecil felt that his Golden Apples still deserved the Eclipse Award
for best turf distaffer. The Breeders' Cup was Starine's only win of
the year.</TE>
<TE>   After the Breeders' Cup, Dress To Thrill was sent back to Weld's
stable in Ireland, a trip that required a plane out of Chicago, a
six-hour van ride through England and a ferry across the Irish Sea.
Dress To Thrill's return to the U.S. was a bit easier, if not
farther: She was flown from Dublin to Los Angeles, with a 36-hour
stopover in Amsterdam, and arrived at Hollywood Park a week before
the Matriarch.</TE>
<TE>   "There's no magic secret about the travel," said Weld, who has won
races on four continents and shipped Media Puzzle all the way to
Australia for a win in the Melbourne Cup a month ago. "You have to
have the horse physically and mentally right, and you need a good
staff. [Dress To Thrill] shipped better for this race than she did
for the Breeders' Cup."</TE>
<TE>   Dress To Thrill's win, worth $300,000, was her sixth in nine
starts. Weld still rates his 1990 Belmont Stakes win, with longshot
Go And Go, as one of the high-water marks of a distinguished career.
Walter Haefner, 91, who bred and raced Go And Go, bred and owns Dress
To Kill, and he also bred Media Puzzle. Dress To Kill may get a
chance to settle down next year, with trainer Christophe Clement in
New York.</TE>
<TE>   Trainer Bobby Frankel, who had to scratch Tates Creek from the
race, blamed himself for entrymate Banks Hill's defeat.</TE>
<TE>   "I gave bad instructions [to jockey Jerry Bailey]," Frankel said.
"I was wrong when I thought there wouldn't be any [early] pace."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Only one favorite -- Good Journey in the Citation Handicap -- won
during Hollywood Park's three-day, six-stake turf festival. The fifth
non-favored winner came Sunday, when Johar, at 9-2, beat Mananan
McLir by 1 1/2 lengths as favored Century City finished next to last
in the $500,000 Hollywood Derby.</TE>
<TE>   Johar, bred and owned by the Thorougbred Corp., gave jockey Alex
Solis his third and trainer Richard Mandella his first Hollywood
Derby win.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of horses might have been upset by [getting squeezed
between horses] at the start, but he didn't care," Solis said. "Right
away, he got back in the race. Actually, he wanted to go, but I had
to take hold of him. He had already broken bad, so I was just
saving."</TE>
<TE>   After breaking his maiden and winning an allowance at Santa Anita
early in the year, Johar had some good but non-winning efforts in
five stakes before he won the Oak Tree Derby on Oct. 13.</TE>

<DH>Lynwood has four starters back from its state title team</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARTIN HENDERSON</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Nearly everyone agrees that defending Division I state champion
Lynwood -- with four returning starters, including one of the top
prospects in the nation, and two talented transfers -- is the best
high school girls' basketball team in the country, and so the
pressure is on every day.</LD>
<LD>   In practice. In games. In the classroom. Even in the
administration office. Don't do anything to slip up, to become
ineligible, to put at risk a remarkable opportunity.</LD>
<LD>   "The challenge is, day in and day out, knowing that each
competitor is going to raise its level of play to meet ours," said
Ellis Barfield, who last season coached Lynwood to a 33-0 record,
which included a Southern Section Division I-AA title and a mythical
national championship that was all-but-decided-on-the-court by
victories over some of the top programs in the country. "Our biggest
challenge is maintaining our focus, and to take each game one at a
time.</LD>
<TE>   "Last year we achieved a lot of greatness and success, but I think
we can achieve that [again], but we can't take anything for granted.
Just like we work hard, other teams are working hard to have success
to get where we got last year. It's going to take double the effort.
Everyone knows about us."</TE>
<TE>   Sade Wiley-Gatewood, The Times' player of the year in the
Southeast/South Coast region and a Southland all-star, averaged 22
points, 10 assists, seven rebounds and six steals last season as a
sophomore. The 5-foot-9 guard will be the focal point of the team and
will get the opportunity to define her legacy.</TE>
<TE>   "Last year, you could say Lynwood had [seniors] Janice Bright and
Andrea Adams, but this year there's no doubt whose team it is," said
Coach James Anderson of Harbor City Narbonne, which began last season
as the No. 1 team in the Southland -- and the nation, according to
some -- but lost to Lywnood in the Southern California final, 52-33.
"This year, there's no speculation on who to stop."</TE>
<TE>   Wiley-Gatewood has the ability to make those around her better --
and to begin with, they are talented.</TE>
<TE>   "We're riding her right now," Barfield said. "Sade knows how to
create her own offense, and she can get the ball to the right person
at the right time. She knows when someone is hot. The game runs
smoothly with the ball in her hands.</TE>
<TE>   "We know Sade stands head and shoulders above the competition
level, but we also have great players returning that people fail to
mention, but now they're going to get a chance to see."</TE>
<TE>   Those players include senior swing player LaJoyce King, who
averaged eight points and four assists last season, junior swing
player Lorie Rayford, who averaged 12 points and 10 rebounds, and 6-4
senior center Tiffani Burries, who averaged 10 points, eight rebounds
and three blocks.</TE>
<TE>   Then there's the influx of new talent.</TE>
<TE>   Senior guard Kameca Simmons transferred to Lynwood from Long Beach
Poly -- which lost to Lynwood in last year's regional semifinal,
58-52 -- along with forward Brandi Kimble, who attended Newhall Hart
last season and commutes daily.</TE>
<TE>   Simmons and Kimble were Times' all-region players last season.
Another transfer is guard Sade Cunningham, who played briefly last
season at Redondo before leaving the team.</TE>
<TE>   All can make an impact and add to the depth of a team that would
have been ranked No. 1 in the Southland without them. "They bring a
lot of big-game experience to the table," Barfield said of Simmons
and Kimble. "Our chemistry is fine right now, but like a game, you
want to build on it and become better."</TE>
<TE>   This is where Lynwood's administration has to make the big play.
As of last week, Simmons still was not eligible and wasn't even
practicing with the team, according to Barfield. Because Simmons
already used a hardship waiver to transfer from Compton Dominguez to
Poly as a freshman, she must change residence to be eligible at
Lynwood. If she plays and is later considered ineligible, a perfect
season could be lost.</TE>
<TE>   Not that Lynwood couldn't go on to win a state title without her.</TE>
<TE>   Three Players to Watch</TE>
<TE>   Ashlee Trebilcock, Newhall Hart, So.: With Kimble out of the
picture, the sophomore guard will be tested even more than she was as
a freshman, when she averaged 16.7 points. As good as she was in
leading her team to the Division I-A finals, she needs to be even
better this season.</TE>
<TE>   Camille LeNoir, Narbonne, Jr.: The area's best pure point guard
averaged 12 points, seven assists and four steals in helping the
Gauchos win the City championship last season. With the team clearly
in her hands, she will be the key if Narbonne is to regain its status
as the area's top team.</TE>
<TE>   Sara Brown, San Clemente, Sr.: She's not the best player on her
team, but Brown might be the most important because her perimeter
success will open avenues for Lindsey Pluimer (6-3) and Lauren Riley
(6-4), a transfer from Irvine Woodbridge, as the Tritons go for a
third section title in a row.</TE>
<TE>   Three Teams to Watch</TE>
<TE>   Chino Hills Ayala: Only one starter is back, but many rave about
the freshman class and its impact, especially LaTara Darrett, a 5-10
guard.</TE>
<TE>   Ventura: Southern Section Division II-AA champion surpassed
Ventura Buena last season as the best team in a basketball-rich area
but graduated its two best players. Buena has had staying power
through the years, and with senior three-point shooter Lindsey
Albrant stepping in to replace Jenni Dooley, can Ventura stay around
too?</TE>
<TE>   Etiwanda: Eagles have great expectations, and opposing coaches
rave about their talent, quickness and athleticism, but being
fundamentally poor and impatient aren't exactly characteristics of
champions.</TE>
<TE>   Three Transfers to Watch</TE>
<TE>   Dominique Harris, Redondo: This explosive junior guard from Venice
joins seven returning players and offsets the loss of injured Allison
Bretana (torn anterior cruciate ligament), who could return by
mid-month.</TE>
<TE>   Andrea Jacobson, Brea Olinda: A senior from Minnesota, this 6-4
center gives the Ladycats an inside presence not seen since Chelsea
Trotter readied herself for Stanford.</TE>
<TE>   Eva Camarena, Huntington Beach Edison, Jr.: A three-point shooter
with terrific range, Camarena averaged 17 points as a freshman at
Westminster, but didn't play last season. She will help fill the void
left by the graduated Ziemann twins, Rachael and Bianca.</TE>

Rank  School                          Comment
1     LYNWOOD  (SS-Div. I-AA)         There are few sure things in
                                      preseason rankings; this is one
2     NARBONNE  (City, Div. I)        Jamie Funn to USC, Indi Johnson
                                      to Purdue, team to City title
3     SAN CLEMENTE  (SS-Div. I-A)     More talent around her means a
                                      more dangerous Lindsey Pluimer
4     L.B. POLY  (SS-Div. I-AA)       With Kameca Simmons gone,
                                      Judith Smith aims for big
                                      season
5     L.B. WILSON  (SS-Div. I-AA)     Remember Lynwood 80, Wilson 76?
                                      Four starters back for Bruins
6     BISHOP MONT. (SS-Div. III-A)    With basketball players still
                                      in volleyball, will be slow
                                      starters
7     ARTESIA (SS-Div. III-AA)        Deeper than last season, the
                                      III-AA winners may be better
                                      still
8     BREA OLINDA  (SS-Div. II-A)     Could move up when Jennifer
                                      Katsuyama (torn ACL) returns
9     ROSARY  (SS-Div. III-A)         With four starters back,
                                      there's something Royal about
                                      Rosary
10    TROY (SS-Div. II-AA)            Amanda Livingston expected to
                                      leave her calling card . . .
                                      often
11    REDONDO  (SS-Div. II-A)         A slow start likely until
                                      Allison Bretana (torn ACL)
                                      returns
12    EISENHOWER  (SS-Div. I-AA)      Nearly everyone back, including
                                      Jasmine Clarendon
13    S. MARGARITA  (SS-Div. III-AA)  Perpetually underrated, that
                                      won't be the case this season
14    AYALA (SS-Div. I-AA)            What do you get when the top
                                      freshmen come to your school?
15    HART  (SS-Div. I-A)             Had Brandi Kimble stayed, we'd
                                      be talking top 10
16    SAUGUS  (SS-Div. I-A)           Big expectations with Sheridan
                                      Arredondo (6-3) as anchor
17    B. BURROUGHS  (SS-II-A)         Up-tempo, good defense and
                                      Tulyah Gaines
18    VALENCIA  (SS-Div. I-AA)        When the Vikings are on their
                                      game, it's smooth sailing
19    WESTCHESTER (City-Div. I)       Athletic, but have to jell
                                      under new coach
20    MATER DEI (SS-Div. II-A)        Monarch defense can be a royal
                                      pain
21    PALMDALE (SS-Div. I-AA)         A 6-4 center such as Teiosha
                                      George is a good thing
22    TEM. VALLEY (SS-Div. I-AA)      Five starters back from a squad
                                      that was 26-3
23    KEPPEL (SS-Div. II-AA)          Aztecs can win, but soft
                                      schedule not likely to prove
                                      much
24    ETIWANDA (SS-Div. I-AA)         Could be higher, could be
                                      lower, could be streaky
25    BISHOP AMAT (SS-Div. III-A)     Lancers present a big problem,
                                      especially in the paint</TE>

<HD>New Role Awaits Esperanza's Meek</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Ben Bolch</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Of all the numbers Gary Meek posted during 17 seasons as football
coach at Anaheim Esperanza High -- two Southern Section
championships, roughly 100 players who went on to play in college and
three in the NFL -- five might be the number that sticks in his mind,
at least for the next couple of weeks.</LD>
<LD>   That's the number of turnovers Esperanza committed Friday in its
season-ending 30-12 loss to Santa Ana Mater Dei in a Southern Section
Division I quarterfinal at Cal State Fullerton.</LD>
<LD>   "I wish we could have played better," said Meek, 55, who is
stepping down as coach to replace longtime Athletic Director Jim
Patterson next semester. Meek might have considered a dual role as
coach and athletic director except for Placentia-Yorba Linda Unified
School District rules that bar such an arrangement.</LD>
<TE>   Meek said he was intrigued by the opportunity to guide a school's
athletic program and encourage athletes to go against the grain of
one-sport specialization. Another factor was the financial incentive.
And Meek couldn't bear the thought of an outsider running the
athletic department.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't want to see someone come in who doesn't know us and our
philosophies at Esperanza and the traditions we have," Meek said.
"That was a little scary to me."</TE>
<TE>   Meek almost became athletic director last year, when Patterson
announced that he was prepared to step down. But Meek didn't want his
career to end after a 4-5-1 season and convinced school and district
officials to let him stay on one more semester as coach.</TE>
<TE>   Meek said he was confident his successor would be selected from
within the program.</TE>
<TE>   Among his favorite memories, Meek listed the 1990 team that
finished 14-0 and defeated Santa Fe Springs St. Paul to win the
Division III title. He also recalled the 1992 team that won a
Division II title and the 1986 squad -- his first -- that went 9-2-1
and reached the quarterfinals.</TE>
<TE>   Nearly 48 hours after his final game, Meek said it still had not
sunk in that a 27-year coaching career had ended.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think it will hit me until next year," he said, "when
everything starts up again and I'm not out there on the field."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Raul Lara knows all about the Long Beach Poly-Mater Dei rivalry,
having served as the Jackrabbits' defensive coordinator from 1995 to
2000, but he doesn't know what it feels like to face the Monarchs as
a head coach.</TE>
<TE>   Lara will get his opportunity Saturday when the teams play in a
Division I semifinal at Edison Field as part of a doubleheader. Los
Alamitos and Los Angeles Loyola will play in the other semifinal.
Game times have not been announced.</TE>
<TE>   "It's going to be a challenge," said Lara, who has a 23-2 record
in two seasons. "We can't go in there thinking we're going to roll
over them. We have to play a good game."</TE>
<TE>   Mater Dei Coach Bruce Rollinson has little doubt that his
counterpart will be ready.</TE>
<TE>   "He's been in two [Concord] De La Salle games and has been under
the gun," Rollinson said. "I don't think this is any big deal to
him."</TE>
<TE>   Rollinson fears that his Monarchs do not match up well with the
Jackrabbits along the offensive and defensive lines and might have
problems covering Poly's fleet of speedy receivers.</TE>
<TE>   That receiving corps took a hit Friday when Khalid Abdur-Rahim had
to be taken to a hospital after reporting numbness on his left side
following a tackle. Lara said Abdur-Rahim was not seriously injured
but probably won't play against the Monarchs.</TE>
<TE>   Mater Dei running back Rafael Rice, the team's leading rusher, is
probable for the game after sitting out the quarterfinal victory over
Esperanza because of an inflamed nerve in his back. Rafael's brother,
Cortez, and John Martinez filled in to lead the Monarchs.</TE>
<TE>   It would be a shame if the teams were at less than full strength
as they renew their storied rivalry, which has been especially
intense the last six years.</TE>
<TE>   Poly beat Mater Dei in the 1997 championship game at the Coliseum,
but the Monarchs returned the favor in 1998 when the teams met for
the title at Edison Field. A 21-21 tie in a 1999 title rematch at
Edison Field prompted the Southern Section council to rule that
overtimes must be played in championship games.</TE>
<TE>   In 1996, the last time Poly and Mater Dei played in the playoffs
before the championship game, the Monarchs emerged with a semifinal
victory and went on to defeat Loyola to win the title.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Quintin Daniels had two interceptions in Los Angeles Loyola's 38-8
upset of Bellflower St. John Bosco, but Jesus Cuellar was the unsung
hero for the Cub defense in the Division I quarterfinal.</TE>
<TE>   Cuellar, a senior defensive back, was assigned to cover Joe Cowan,
a 6-foot-4 receiver with game-breaking ability. Cowan was limited to
one catch for five yards.</TE>
<TE>   "We doubled-teamed him a lot, but Cuellar did a great job on him
one on one," Coach Steve Grady said.</TE>
<TE>   .</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Chino will not make a third consecutive appearance in the Division
II final because its offense, which gained plenty of yards between
the red zones, was bottled up in crucial situations in a 13-9
quarterfinal loss to San Clemente.</TE>
<TE>   The Cowboys drove inside the Tritons' 20 twice in the first half
but had to settle for field goals each time.</TE>
<TE>   A blocked punt late in the game gave Chino a first down at the
Triton 26 and a chance for the victory. Running back Jacob Flowe
moved the Cowboys to the 23, but Aubrey McCravey sacked Kevin Glaab
for a three-yard loss on the next play. Glaab's pass fell incomplete
on third down and San Clemente secured the victory when Josh
Smallwood's pass to Glaab on a flea-flicker on fourth down fell
short.</TE>
<TE>   San Clemente quarterback Beau Budde's 11-yard scoring pass to
Chris Miller with 7:30 left to play allowed the Tritons to avenge a
home loss to Chino in last year's semifinals.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Antelope Valley Lancaster Coach Brent Newcomb said
quarterback-safety-punter Johnny Walker, who suffered a sprained
thumb in the team's 43-22 victory over Arcadia, probably will play
against Manhattan Beach Mira Costa in a Division II semifinal
Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Frustration mounted in the fourth quarter of Santa Ana Foothill's
37-21 victory over La Mirada, as each team was flagged for two major
penalties. Coincidentally, they were called on consecutive plays on
separate occasions.</TE>
<TE>   When the game ended, at least one leader emerged for La Mirada, as
senior defensive back Jason Gardner kept telling his agitated
teammates, "Take it like men."</TE>
<TE>   Staff writers Martin Henderson and Peter Yoon and correspondent
Bryan Dopp contributed to this report.</TE>

<HD>Improved Defense Leads Colts</HD>

<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>INDIANAPOLIS</DL>
<LD>The Indianapolis Colts aren't just winning shootouts anymore. Their
defense is winning games too.</LD>
<LD>   The Colts converted two first-quarter fumbles by Houston into 10
points, got two field goals from Mike Vanderjagt and used a late
touchdown run by James Mungro as the defense dominated in a 19-3
victory over the Texans on Sunday.</LD>
<LD>   Indianapolis (8-4) won its fourth in a row and stayed one game
ahead of Tennessee, setting up the teams' AFC South showdown next
week in Nashville.</LD>
<TE>   But with its usually productive offense bogging down, Indianapolis
had to take a different tack -- relying on a vastly improved defense
to shut down the expansion Texans (3-9).</TE>
<TE>   Indianapolis allowed 165 yards, forced two turnovers deep in
Houston territory, sacked David Carr six times and just missed
getting its first shutout since December 1997. Marvin Harrison caught
nine passes for 101 yards for the Colts and tied Raymond Berry's
franchise record for career receptions (631). Harrison also had his
fourth consecutive 100-yard game.</TE>
<TE>   However, Peyton Manning passed for only 190 yards, completing 15
of 28 attempts, and two-time NFL rushing leader Edgerrin James was
limited to 65 yards in 20 carries and sat out the final few series
after irritating his injured right ankle.</TE>
<TE>   The Colts had only 267 total yards.</TE>

<HD>Heinze Tries to Impress After Stint in Minors</HD>

<LD>After spending time in the minors for the first time in his career,
veteran forward Steve Heinze is trying to make the most out of his
second chance with the Kings, who recalled him from Manchester of the
American Hockey League on Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   "I thought they would trade me, which would have been preferable
to being [sent to the minors], but that didn't happen," said Heinze,
who played well in consecutive games against the Mighty Ducks and
Chicago over the weekend. "In the end, you just have to be a man
about it and be a professional."</LD>
<LD>   Heinze, 32, who scored 15 goals last season for the Kings, had
never experienced the minors because he went from Boston College to
the U.S. Olympic team to the NHL.</LD>
<TE>   But even after joining the Monarchs and scoring 17 points in 18
games, Heinze's stock still seemed to drop with the Kings, who
recalled Derek Armstrong, Steve Kelly, Mike Cammalleri and Pavel Rosa
before him.</TE>
<TE>   "It's their job to make those decisions," Heinze said. "They're in
the business of winning games. They make those calls, not me. I
didn't agree with what they decided, but I wasn't going to sulk about
it. It's my job to work as hard as I can."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Coach Andy Murray has paired defenseman Dmitry Yushkevich,
acquired in a trade from Florida last week, with Mathieu Schneider,
who played with Yushkevich with the Toronto Maple Leafs for two-plus
seasons (1996-98)....The Kings, who do not play again until they play
host to Nashville on Thursday, did not practice Sunday and also will
have today off.</TE>

<TE>   The Kings will make their annual visit to Children's Hospital
today to distribute toys for the holidays....King players and staff
will participate in a holiday ceremony downtown Tuesday. The "Tree of
Life and Festival of Lights" will take place at California Plaza.
King TV announcer Bob Miller will be the master of ceremonies.</TE>

<HD>MRI Tests for Horry, Walker Today</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Tim Brown</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Power forwards Robert Horry and Samaki Walker are scheduled for MRI
exams today. Horry has a sore left foot and Walker has been on the
injured list for a week because of a strained lower back.</LD>
<LD>   An X-ray of Horry's foot Sunday night was negative. Horry
continues to have pain, however, and did not dress for the game
against the Minnesota Timberwolves. He did not play Friday in
Memphis, either.</LD>
<LD>   *</LD>
<TE>   Walker was so bothered by Kobe Bryant's comments about his back
injury that he spoke to Coach Phil Jackson about it, Jackson revealed
Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   While Jackson insisted the team was not disrupted, he added,
"There's times for criticism and times for perhaps encouragement.</TE>
<TE>   "I've just learned over the past that when a player says he's
injured, he's injured."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers activated Devean George from the injured list for
Sunday night's game.</TE>
<TE>   George, the athletic small forward who averaged 11.7 points in the
team's first seven games, developed tendinitis in his right ankle and
hadn't played since Nov. 8 in Washington.</TE>
<TE>   Guard Jannero Pargo, who averaged 9.1 minutes in 14 games, was put
on the injured list. He has tendinitis in his right knee, according
to the team.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   A ceremony that will rename as Chick Hearn Court the stretch of
11th Street in front of Staples Center between Figueroa and Cherry
streets will be held Tuesday at 1 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   The public is invited to the corner of Georgia and 11th streets
for the function, which will include the unveiling of a street sign.
Marge Hearn, Mayor Jim Hahn and several former and current Lakers are
expected to attend.</TE>

you're trying to remain at the top, it always is."</TE>

<TE>   Shaquille O'Neal said he experienced no unusual pain after playing
43 minutes in the overtime win at Memphis, by seven minutes the
longest he'd played on his surgically repaired foot.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm good," he said. "I'm just trying to get into WWF shape. Guys
are wrestling me."</TE>

<HD>Lakers in Free Fall</HD>
<DH>Bryant's tying free throw doesn't drop but defending
champions do, into last place after 110-107 loss to Minnesota.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Tim Brown</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Kobe Bryant missed the free throw.</LD>
<LD>   Joe Smith did the unfathomable, fouling Bryant 24 feet from the
basket inside of 10 seconds remaining, the Laker deficit three,
Staples Center at full bellow, and then Bryant missed the free throw,
the last of three, and the Lakers lost again.</LD>
<LD>   The Minnesota Timberwolves, fresh from nowhere, defeated them,
110-107, on an otherwise sleepy Sunday night at 11th and Figueroa
streets, leaving the three-time defending champions with two injured
power forwards, a recovering center and a 6-12 record, which leaves
them tied with the Clippers for last place in the Pacific Division.</LD>
<TE>   At the end of the Lakers' latest bout of ineffectiveness, it was
Bryant at the line, Bryant who might have saved them from themselves,
Bryant whose shot hit the inside right of the rim, the inside left
and then popped free as the crowd groaned. But it could have been
anyone, because defeat again came from a hundred tiny places,
becoming official with a last three-point heave from Bryant at the
buzzer.</TE>
<TE>   "Well, it just is another loss," Coach Phil Jackson said. "They
seem to be piling up now with some regularity and we can't seem to
stop that momentum at this particular time and right ourselves and
feel like, OK, we have a feel now for what we're trying to do."</TE>
<TE>   On the floor, after the free throw, Bryant sighed and put his
hands on his hips. After a moment, he gripped the sides of his shorts
and scowled. He had scored 22 points, 10 in the fourth quarter.
Shaquille O'Neal, in his sixth game off the injured list, had 31
points, 13 in the fourth quarter, and 13 rebounds.</TE>
<TE>   And then it wasn't enough, because Bryant's free throw to tie it
with 7.2 seconds remaining missed, because the Lakers were lax on
defense for too long, and because at the end of the fourth quarter,
there were moments when Kevin Garnett -- and not O'Neal or Bryant --
was the best player on the floor.</TE>
<TE>   "I guess it just wasn't meant to be," Bryant said of his free
throw. "It's like Tiger putting and the thing just hits the lip and
rolls off."</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers shot OK (46.3 %) from everywhere but the three-point
arc (three for 15) and rebounded with some verve. But they allowed at
least 106 points for the third consecutive game (Memphis needed
overtime for its 106), and six Timberwolves scored in double figures,
and if they aren't bored on defense, it still looks like it.</TE>
<TE>   The Timberwolves made 50.6% of their field-goal attempts and so
won for the first time in 17 games against the Lakers in Los Angeles,
and another chip of invulnerability is gone, just in case they care.</TE>
<TE>   "We're kind of beating ourselves, shooting ourselves in the foot,"
O'Neal said. "Yes, I think we can correct it, but ... we have to do
some soul searching and everyone has to do their part."</TE>
<TE>   Garnett had 23 points and 15 rebounds. Anthony Peeler scored 17
points in 30 minutes off the bench. And Troy Hudson scored 16 points.
The Timberwolves scored 60 points in the second half, 34 in a fourth
quarter in which they shot 20 free throws.</TE>
<TE>   Bryant had one final opportunity at the buzzer, racing to the
three-point arc on the right wing and flinging a shot toward the
backboard, but it was not close, and as he carried himself from the
floor, he stared up at the scoreboard again, pulled his shirt tail
from his shorts and grimaced.</TE>
<TE>   They lack continuity. They lack end-to-end effort. They are only
3-3 since O'Neal healed, and they've got an entire month to make up.</TE>
<TE>   "We're tag-teaming," Bryant said of O'Neal's return followed by
the departure of Samaki Walker, then Robert Horry's departure and the
return, Sunday, of Devean George. "It's just a matter of time. We
need to be patient and get everybody healthy."</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers had a five-point lead in the first quarter, a 10-point
lead in the second, an 11-point lead in the third, and the
Timberwolves recovered each time. Three minutes into the fourth
quarter, their lead was 87-82 and the Lakers were kicking the ball
out of bounds and Bryant was on the bench and Horry was in a suit and
standing on the fringe of the huddle where Jackson tried to solve it
all.</TE>
<TE>   They blew big leads when O'Neal was on the bench, and couldn't
recover when he was on the floor. And then Bryant missed, and they
all had to start again, wondering when they'd be themselves again.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Kevin Stallings recruited Emeka Okafor for Vanderbilt and knew he
lost out on a good player when the 6-foot-9 center chose Connecticut.</LD>
<LD>   Okafor showed him Sunday night exactly what he's missing.</LD>
<LD>   Okafor scored 25 points and grabbed 11 rebounds in 37 minutes as
No. 12 Connecticut held off Vanderbilt, 76-70, Sunday night at
Nashville. He also blocked three shots.</LD>
<TE>   The Huskies (3-0) trailed only once as Okafor helped them control
their first road game against a Vanderbilt squad that started three
sophomores and got even younger when subbing in three freshmen.</TE>
<TE>   The loss ended a 16-game nonconference winning streak at home for
the Commodores (3-1), who were 54-2 against non-Southeastern
Conference opponents.</TE>
<TE>   It wasn't easy for Connecticut, which has won nine consecutive
road openers against teams outside the Big East. The Huskies' biggest
lead was 11, but the Commodores led once and tied it three other
times.</TE>
<TE>   No. 19 Indiana 84, North Texas 58 -- The Hoosiers, playing for the
first time since winning their first Maui Invitational last week,
struggled at the outset and led by only six points at halftime.</TE>
<TE>   Playing their home opener, the Hoosiers (4-0) used the three-point
shooting of Bracey Wright, Marshall Strickland and Tom Coverdale to
break the game open in the second half.</TE>
<TE>   North Texas (1-2) trailed by nine with 12 minutes left before the
Hoosiers used a 17-2 run to increase their lead to 66-42.</TE>
<TE>   Wake Forest 83, Temple 76 -- Eric Williams scored 19 points and
grabbed 10 rebounds in his second collegiate game to help the Demon
Deacons (2-0) at Winston-Salem, N.C.</TE>
<TE>   The 6-9, 270-pound Williams was eight for 11 from the field and
Vytas Danelius added 14 points and a career-high 14 rebounds.</TE>
<TE>   Temple (0-2) had trouble shooting for a second straight game,
missing 20 of its first 29 shots after making only 35.7% in a
season-opening loss against Rutgers.</TE>
<TE>   College of Charleston 71, Villanova 69 -- A.J. Harris' only basket
-- a tiebreaking shot with 11 seconds left -- gave the Cougars (5-0)
the Great Alaska Shootout title late Saturday night in Anchorage.</TE>
<TE>   Harris' shot came after the Wildcats' Derrick Snowden made a
three-pointer that tied the score, 69-69, with 42 seconds left.</TE>

<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Even though Yao Ming gives the Houston Rockets a much bigger presence
in the middle, they still have no answer for the Sacramento Kings.</LD>
<LD>   Gerald Wallace scored 21 points and had eight rebounds as the
Kings extended their winning streak against Houston to nine games
with a 103-84 victory Sunday night at Sacramento.</LD>
<LD>   It was Sacramento's first look at the heralded 7-foot-5 rookie
center from China. Chris Webber and Vlade Divac took turns
challenging Yao through the first three quarters.</LD>
<TE>   It was an education for Yao, who scored all eight of his points in
the first quarter. He added five rebounds and two blocked shots in 23
minutes.</TE>
<TE>   "He's a rookie, you just go at him," said Webber, who scored 16 of
his 19 points in the first half. "You try to attack him like anyone
else. He's talented, but I don't care who you are, you have to get
adapted to this league."</TE>
<TE>   Bobby Jackson again filled in admirably for injured point guard
Mike Bibby, who is scheduled to have his right foot examined today.</TE>
<TE>   Jackson scored 20 points for the Kings, who improved to 9-0 at
home this season. Sacramento has won eight of nine overall.</TE>
<TE>   Seattle 96, New Jersey 95 -- Brent Barry made a three-point shot
with 3.3 seconds left at Seattle and the SuperSonics ended a
three-game losing streak.</TE>
<TE>   Seattle had lost six of seven and was coming off arguably its
worst effort of the season in an 83-72 loss to Houston on Friday.</TE>
<TE>   Richard Jefferson could have clinched the victory for New Jersey,
but he missed two foul shots after Desmond Mason pulled the
SuperSonics to 95-93 with a jumper with 10.5 seconds left.</TE>
<TE>   After Jefferson missed, the rebound went to Vladimir Radmanovic.
He passed to Mason, who found Barry wide open on the right wing for
the three-pointer.</TE>
<TE>   The Nets had one more chance to win, but Jason Kidd's driving shot
was blocked by Mason just before the buzzer. New Jersey Coach Byron
Scott was angry there was no foul called.</TE>
<TE>   Kidd had 27 points to go with eight rebounds and eight assists for
the Nets, who had two starters sidelined by injuries in Dikembe
Mutombo and Kerry Kittles.</TE>
<TE>   Lucious Harris, making his first start in two years, scored 23
points. Jefferson had 14.</TE>
<TE>   Boston 95, New Orleans 86 -- The Hornets aren't used to playing
without Baron Davis, and it showed as Paul Pierce scored 30 points
and Antoine Walker added 26 to lead the Celtics at Boston.</TE>
<TE>   Davis, the Hornets' second-leading scorer, sat out because of back
pain, ending his consecutive games streak at 248.</TE>
<TE>   Without him, New Orleans committed 24 turnovers and allowed Boston
to make 10 steals. It was the first time Davis has missed a game in
his four-year career.</TE>
<TE>   Toronto 92, Memphis 87 -- Alvin Williams scored four points in the
final 40 seconds to lead the short-handed Raptors at Memphis, Tenn.</TE>
<TE>   Williams' basket with 38.3 seconds to play gave the Raptors an
88-87 lead. He added two free throws with 15.5 seconds left as
Toronto outscored the Grizzlies, 8-0, down the stretch.</TE>
<TE>   Vince Carter, who clinched the victory with a breakaway dunk with
two seconds left, led Toronto with 27 points. The Raptors, who got
Carter back three games ago from a strained quadriceps, dressed only
nine players.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Kings signed guard Jim Jackson and put forward Hedo Turkoglu,
who has a sprained wrist, on the injured list.</TE>
<TE>   Jackson joined his ninth NBA team in 11 seasons. He had been out
of the league since spending last season with Miami.</TE>

<HD>Russia Wins Davis Cup</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Russia won its first Davis Cup title Sunday by rallying to beat
defending champion France, 3-2, with the greatest comeback in a final
in 38 years.</LD>
<LD>   Substitute Mikhail Youzhny -- a ball boy the last time Russia
played in a Cup final -- won the last match in the best-of-five
series in Paris. He rallied from a two-set deficit to defeat
Paul-Henri Mathieu, 3-6, 2-6, 6-3, 7-5, 6-4.</LD>
<LD>   Russia became only the sixth team to win a Cup final after
trailing, 2-1. The last was Australia against the United States in
1964.</LD>
<TE>   Youzhny entered the match with a 1-4 record in Cup play. But he
was selected to replace two-time Grand Slam tournament champion
Yevgeny Kafelnikov, who was tired after playing singles Friday and
doubles Saturday -- losing both. Kafelnikov had said he would retire
if Russia won.</TE>
<TE>   That seemed unlikely when France held a 2-1 lead and hoped to
continue another trend: The team winning the doubles had won the
previous 24 Cup finals.</TE>
<TE>   But Marat Safin, the 2000 U.S. Open champion, tied the final by
defeating Sebastien Grosjean, 6-3, 6-2, 7-6 (11), in the first
reverse singles match. Then the 32nd-ranked Youzhny fought back to
beat Mathieu in a showdown between 20-year-olds.</TE>
<TE>   "Yevgeny was tired after the doubles," Safin said. "So we decided
to put in the young player. Why not?"</TE>
<TE>   Youzhny picked up the last service break in the seventh game of
the final set to go up, 4-3, and he won the match by holding serve at
love.</TE>
<TE>   Russia lost Cup finals in 1994 and 1995.</TE>
<TE>   France was seeking its 10th Cup title and first consecutive
championships since winning from 1927-32. France won last year's
final in Australia.</TE>

<TE>   Stephan Eberharter won for the third time in four men's World Cup
races this season, capping his weekend by finishing first in a
Super-G at Lake Louise, Canada.</TE>
<TE>   Eberharter had a time of 1 minute 23.39 seconds on the 2,410-meter
course on Whitehorn Mountain. Austrian teammate Josef Strobl was
second in 1:23.57 following a fourth-place finish in the downhill,
and Didier Cuche of Switzerland was third in 1:23.76.</TE>
<TE>   "I feel really comfortable," Eberharter said. "I'm 33 years old,
and I have nothing to prove. Maybe that's why things are going so
well at the moment. I can take things easy."</TE>
<TE>   Eberharter and Strobl opted for downhill skis instead of super-G
skis.</TE>
<TE>   "The downhill skis are much harder to turn, and if it's straight
they're faster," Strobl said.</TE>
<TE>   Eberharter, last year's World Cup overall champion, also won a
giant slalom last month at Solden, Austria, and a downhill Saturday
at Lake Louise.</TE>
<TE>   Teemu Kattilakoski and Sami Jauhojarvi anchored Finnish teams to a
1-2 finish in a World Cup cross-country mixed relay at Kuusamo,
Finland.</TE>
<TE>   Kattilakoski helped Finland's top team finish the 30 kilometers in
1 hour 24 minutes 59.4 seconds.</TE>
<TE>   Jauhojarvi's No. 2 Finland team finished 0.1 back. Italy was
third, 0.4 behind.</TE>
<TE>   A women's five-kilometer classic-style leg was followed by a men's
10-kilometer classic, a women's five-kilometer and a men's
10-kilometer freestyle.</TE>
<TE>   A Nordic combined sprint event was canceled because of strong
winds.</TE>
<TE>   Travis Cabral of the U.S. won the moguls title and American
Shannon Bahrke finished second behind Margarita Marbler-Olejnikowa of
Austria in the women's event at a freestyle skiing World Cup meet at
Tignes, France.</TE>
<TE>   Golf</TE>
<TE>   Ernie Els shot a course-record nine-under-par 63 for an
eight-stroke victory over Colin Montgomerie in the $4.06-million
Nedbank Challenge at Sun City, South Africa.</TE>
<TE>   Els, playing in his home country, had nine birdies and finished at
21-under 267 on the 7,743-yard Gary Player Country Club to claim the
$2-million first prize, the richest in golf.</TE>
<TE>   "That was possibly one of the great rounds of my career," said
Els, who won the tournament for the third time in four years. "I
wasn't going after 63 when I started."</TE>
<TE>   Montgomerie, who moved into contention with a third-round 65, had
three birdies and an eagle on the back nine, but it wasn't enough to
stop Els.</TE>
<TE>   Chris DiMarco shot a two-under 70 and finished third at 10 under.
Jim Furyk closed with a 69 and tied Retief Goosen for fourth at seven
under.</TE>
<TE>   Boxing</TE>
<TE>   Heavyweight champion Lennox Lewis is planning three fights
starting in March, including bouts against Vitaly and Wladimir
Klitschko, and a rematch with Mike Tyson.</TE>
<TE>   "I want my fans to know that I am intending to defend my WBC title
against Vitaly Klitschko on March 8, 2003," Lewis told the BBC.</TE>
<TE>   "My negotiating team has a preliminary agreement in place for that
fight, as well as fights against Mike Tyson and Wladimir Klitschko in
the event that I decide to continue fighting after the Vitaly
Klitschko fight."</TE>
<TE>   Lewis, 37, expects the contract for the bout against Vitaly
Klitschko to be finalized within two weeks. Lewis' manager, Adrian
Ogun, said Friday that the site and exact date will be set as soon as
possible.</TE>
<TE>   Ogun also said promoters will meet in the next few days with
representatives from HBO, which will broadcast the fight, to complete
arrangements.</TE>
<TE>   It had been believed that the WBC heavyweight champion from
Britain might quit the sport after beating Tyson in the eighth round
in June at Memphis, Tenn.</TE>
<TE>   But the BBC reported that Lewis will take on Vitaly Klitschko in
March, then give Tyson a rematch and finally face Klitschko's
brother, Wladimir, the WBO titleholder.</TE>

<KH>SAN FRANCISCO 31, SEATTLE 24</KH>
<HD>49ers Almost Let Big Lead Get Away</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>SAN FRANCISCO</DL>
<LD>The San Francisco 49ers are one win away from reclaiming the NFC West
title, though you couldn't see it in their somber faces after they
nearly let another victory slip away.</LD>
<LD>   Garrison Hearst rushed for 124 yards and a career-high three
touchdowns, and Jimmy Williams returned a punt 89 yards for a score
as the 49ers defeated the Seattle Seahawks, 31-24, on Sunday -- their
first victory in three games.</LD>
<LD>   The 49ers (8-4) took a three-game lead in the division, which they
can win for the first time since 1997 with another victory and a loss
by St. Louis (5-7) in the final four games.</LD>
<TE>   But it was hard to find any 49er who was excited about division
titles and playoff glory. They were uniformly glum about a
fourth-quarter collapse, which ended only when Matt Hasselbeck's pass
was intercepted by Rashad Holman in San Francisco territory with 1:23
left.</TE>
<TE>   "I want to see better things out of this offense," said Jeff
Garcia, who passed for only 164 yards and had two early
interceptions. "Today was frustrating, because I don't see the
progress being made."</TE>
<TE>   Despite a virtually nonexistent passing game and having to play
without three starters on defense, the 49ers completed a season sweep
of the Seahawks (4-8). The 49ers won the division rivals' first
meeting since Terrell Owens' infamous Sharpie-in-the-sock stunt seven
weeks earlier in San Francisco's 28-21 win at Seattle.</TE>
<TE>   The 49ers took a 31-10 lead on Hearst's third touchdown early in
the fourth quarter. But Hasselbeck had 311 of his 427 yards passing
in the second half and two fourth-quarter touchdown passes, the
second to Darrell Jackson with 1:57 left.</TE>
<TE>   Orlando Huff recovered an onside kick, and the Seahawks reached
the San Francisco 43. Hasselbeck threw his next pass directly to
Holman, and the backup safety made his second career interception.</TE>

<KH>TENNESSEE 32, NEW YORK GIANTS 29 (OT)</KH>
<HD>No Practice Is Just Perfect for McNair</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J.</DL>
<LD>Maybe Steve McNair should skip every Tennessee practice.</LD>
<LD>   After sitting out all week because of rib, shin and toe injuries,
McNair threw three touchdown passes, ran for a game-tying two-point
conversion and helped set up Joe Nedney's 38-yard field goal in
overtime that gave the Titans a 32-29 victory over the New York
Giants on Sunday.</LD>
<LD>   "Steve did a tremendous job of guiding the team to victory," said
receiver Derrick Mason, who had 12 catches for 116 yards and a
touchdown. "His ribs are battered. His feet are hurting and he still
scrambled to put us in position [for the game-tying score]. To me,
Steve is the best quarterback in the NFL."</LD>
<TE>   McNair, who was 30 for 43 for 334 yards, also is why the Titans
(7-5) have won six of seven and are in the thick of the playoff
chase, unlike the Giants (6-6).</TE>
<TE>   "We can't even look at the playoffs anymore," Giant running back
Tiki Barber said after their second straight loss. "We don't control
what happens anymore. We have to rely on other teams to lose. The one
thing we can control is to win."</TE>
<TE>   McNair didn't know until game time whether he was going to play.</TE>
<TE>   "I felt I was going to play as long as I didn't take a hit or
aggravate it any further," said McNair, who bounced back after
throwing three interceptions in a loss to Baltimore last week.</TE>
<TE>   The Giants had their chances to put away the Titans late in the
fourth quarter when they had first and goal at Tennessee's one
following a 34-yard pass play from Kerry Collins to Amani Toomer.</TE>
<TE>   But the Giants lost a yard in three plays and settled for Matt
Bryant's 19-yard field goal to take a 29-21 lead with 2:21 to go.</TE>
<TE>   McNair made the Giants pay for not punching the ball in, leading
an 81-yard, 12-play scoring drive. He connected with tight end Frank
Wycheck on a nine-yard touchdown pass with nine seconds to play.
After a video review upheld the catch, McNair strolled into the end
zone on a quarterback draw to tie the score at 29.</TE>
<TE>   The Giants received the overtime kickoff and got to the Titan 46
going into a stiff wind. But Toomer was called for offensive pass
interference, nullifying a gain to the 32.</TE>
<TE>   The Titans took over at their 20 and McNair passed to Drew Bennett
for 12 yards, John Simon for 23 and Mason for 12. A 14-yard run by
Robert Holcombe eventually set up Nedney's winning kick with 10:00 to
go.</TE>

<HD>Packers Feeling Entitled</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>GREEN BAY, Wis.</DL>
<LD>Spectacular touchdown-saving plays by two backups named Walker
allowed the Green Bay Packers to win their first division title in
five years.</LD>
<LD>   The Packers won the NFC North by beating the Chicago Bears, 30-20,
Sunday, despite losing running back Ahman Green to a knee injury.</LD>
<LD>   Rookie Tony Fisher, not drafted out of Notre Dame, ran for 91
yards and a touchdown in 17 carries as the Packers (9-3), won for the
first time in three games to become the first team to clinch a
playoff spot and remain the only team without a loss at home.</LD>
<TE>   They couldn't have done it without rookie receiver Javon Walker,
who ran almost the entire field to make a tackle which prevented a
touchdown that would have given the Bears' a 15-point halftime lead.
Then nose tackle Rod Walker forced a fumble on the Bears' center
exchange on first and goal at the Packer one-yard line in the third
quarter.</TE>
<TE>   On a cold, windy day at Lambeau Field, Brett Favre threw two
second-half touchdown passes and improved to 33-0 at home when the
temperature is 34 or below.</TE>
<TE>   The Packers trailed, 14-6, at halftime after Javon Walker ran
about 100 yards and tackled Roosevelt Williams as he was about to
score at the end of the first half. "It would have been devastating
to have them score like that right before the half," said Packer
Coach Mike Sherman.</TE>
<TE>   Green Bay was behind 14-13 when Rod Walker grabbed the ball as
quarterback Jim Miller took the snap from Olin Kreutz. The Packers
converted the turnover into a Mike Longwell field goal that gave them
the lead for good at 16-14.</TE>

<KH>CAROLINA 13, CLEVELAND 6</KH>
<HD>Brown's Too Much for Browns</HD>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>CLEVELAND</DL>
<LD>After nearly three months of self-destruction, the Carolina Panthers
finally damaged somebody else's season.</LD>
<LD>   Dee Brown, a second-year running back out of Syracuse, rushed for
122 yards in his first NFL start as Carolina ended a losing streak at
eight Sunday with a 13-6 victory over Cleveland, hurting the sloppy
Browns' playoff chances.</LD>
<LD>   The Panthers (4-8), who began the season 3-0, won for the first
time since Sept. 22. Carolina has also had numerous off-field
problems -- the most notable being wide receiver Steve Smith's
assault of teammate Anthony Bright during a film session.</LD>
<TE>   "So many bad things have happened to us," said tight end Wesley
Walls, who scored the game's lone touchdown. "That made this one
sweet, real sweet. This is our most satisfying win because of what
we've been through."</TE>
<TE>   Like so many of Cleveland's games in the last two seasons, this
one had some controversy as officials waved off an apparent go-ahead
touchdown by Browns' wide receiver Kevin Johnson with 1:57 remaining.</TE>
<TE>   The Browns (6-6) had five turnovers and quarterback Tim Couch
threw three interceptions, the last coming on a bobbled ball that
Carolina's Emmanuel McDaniel grabbed with 1:45 left.</TE>

<KH>WEEK 13 IN THE NFL MIKE PENNER</KH>
<HD>It's Vick's League Now</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE PENNER</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Eight decades of professional football flashed before our eyes Sunday
as Michael Vick took the final snap of the Atlanta-Minnesota game and
didn't stop running until he stepped inside the winning locker room.</LD>
<LD>   Viking defenders gave chase, briefly. Seven of them got within
autograph-asking range. Two of them got their hands on the runaway
blur, but not much more.</LD>
<LD>   For 46 mesmerizing yards, Vick darted and danced and bobbed and
weaved, leaving 11 hapless purple pylons in his wake as he sprinted
to the end zone to end overtime and craft a wintry scene certain to
haunt the frozen-in-their-tracks Vikings deep into the holidays.</LD>
<TE>   The Falcon and the Snowmen.</TE>
<TE>   You can call Vick's 46-yard dash the play that gave the Falcons
their 30-24 overtime victory over the Vikings. You can also call Vick
a second-year NFL quarterback.</TE>
<TE>   In either case, this is not the time, and certainly not the
player, for just the facts.</TE>
<TE>   Vick was carrying a lot of extra weight as he tore up the
Metrodome carpet.</TE>
<TE>   With that touchdown, Vick kept the Falcons unbeaten in their last
eight games -- the NFL's longest undefeated streak this year and the
most inexplicable in many.</TE>
<TE>   With those yards, Vick broke the NFL record for most rushing yards
by a quarterback in a game while establishing the new standard for
"balanced offense" -- 173 rushing yards and 173 passing yards.</TE>
<TE>   With that run, Vick supplanted Steve Young's famous 49-yard ramble
in 1988 -- also coming against the Vikings, who really know how to
choreograph these things -- as the greatest piece of quarterbacking
legwork to find its way onto an NFL Films highlight reel.</TE>
<TE>   The other Falcons eventually were able to catch up to Vick once he
stopped running, having already streaked through the end zone and up
the stadium tunnel into the dressing room.</TE>
<TE>   The rest of the NFL is another story.</TE>
<TE>   Was it coincidence or symbolism that on the same day Vick was
sprinting the NFL into the 21st century, St. Louis' Kurt Warner was
looking like a drop-back dinosaur in Philadelphia, failing to produce
a touchdown in a 10-3 loss to the Eagles that all but knocked the
Rams out of playoff contention?</TE>
<TE>   Fade-back-and-fling-it was a quarterback style that served the NFL
well for 80-plus years. But with every step Vick takes, with the rest
of a notorious copycat league following his every move, the old
in-the-pocket routine looks more and more like the real gunslingers
of another era, headed nowhere except the musty pages of history.</TE>
<TE>   Vick is 22. Had he decided to use all his college eligibility,
he'd be wrapping up his senior season at Virginia Tech right now.
He's rough around the edges and probably operating at only a fraction
of his capacity, once he figures out what he's doing out there.</TE>
<TE>   But until that happens, let him be what he is. Which is the most
exciting player in pro football, except he's more important than
that.</TE>
<TE>   In a league overrun by the fair and the middling, Michael Vick is
a one-man antidote to parity. He probably hasn't taken the time to
notice, but Vick now belongs to an NFL mired in middle-age bloat --
fat around the middle -- with nearly half the league within one game
of .500.</TE>
<TE>   Cleveland, a so-called playoff contender, committed five turnovers
against 4-8 Carolina on Sunday and lost at home, 13-6, to fall to
6-6.</TE>
<TE>   The New York Giants, in a game they had to win, blew a 12-point
fourth-quarter lead to Tennessee and lost at home, in overtime,
32-29, to fall to ... 6-6.</TE>
<TE>   Because the Buffalo Bills ended a three-game losing streak to end
the Miami Dolphins' two-game winning streak, 38-21, the Dolphins
share the AFC East lead with New England at 7-5 -- with last-place
Buffalo a game back at 6-6. If the New York Jets defeat Oakland
tonight, they will join the Dolphins and Patriots as AFC East
tri-leaders -- all for 7-5 and 7-5 for all.</TE>
<TE>   Atlanta would be right there at .500, if not worse, had the
Falcons not gambled 20 months ago and traded up to use the top pick
of the 2000 draft on Vick. Before he became their starting
quarterback in September, the Falcons had gone 16-32 in their
previous three seasons. This season they are 8-3-1 -- 7-0-1 in their
last eight games.</TE>
<TE>   Before Vick bailed them out, the Falcons came very close to losing
to a Viking team that long ago gave up on this season. Atlanta netted
379 yards on offense. Vick accounted for 346 of them.</TE>
<TE>   He is still a work in progress, especially in the subtle art of
passing. Against the Vikings, Vick completed only 11 of 28 passes,
with an interception. For the season, he has thrown for 1,994 yards
and 10 touchdowns -- modest numbers during a season in which
Oakland's Rich Gannon in on pace to break Dan Marino's single-season
record of 5,084 passing yards.</TE>
<TE>   But Vick has run for 648 yards and eight touchdowns and generally
drives defensive coordinators mad every time he rolls out. Sunday, he
broke the rushing record for a quarterback by 23 yards. Green Bay's
Tobin Rote held the old record for more than half a century, having
scrambled for 150 yards against Chicago in 1951.</TE>
<TE>   With 173 yards in 10 carries, Vick broke the record for most
rushing yards per carry. That one was also set a half-century ago --
Cleveland's Marion Motley averaged 17.09 yards a carry by netting 188
yards in 11 attempts against Pittsburgh in 1950.</TE>
<TE>   Already, Vick is forcing other teams to think differently. The
Vikings, recognizing that Daunte Culpepper-to-Randy Moss isn't
getting it done anymore, decided to reverse the Randy Ratio against
the Falcons -- snapping the ball to an in-motion Moss and having him
throw cross-field to Culpepper.</TE>
<TE>   It appeared to work, too, for a potential game-winning touchdown.
But officials wiped out the score, flagging the Vikings for an
illegal formation. For Minnesota, now 3-9, it has been that kind of
season.</TE>
<TE>   Likewise, Tennessee pulled the unusual to pull out a crucial
victory over the Giants. Needing a two-point conversion to force
overtime, Steve McNair got it on his own -- flim-flamming the Giants
with a quarterback draw to even the score in the final seconds,
putting the Titans in position to win the game in overtime.</TE>
<TE>   Even Drew Bledsoe, as dyed-in-the-wool stay-in-the-pocket as they
come, ran for a touchdown in Buffalo's must-have victory against the
Dolphins.</TE>
<TE>   Welcome to life in Michael Vick's NFL, where the options suddenly
have become quite clear: Either adapt, quickly, or be left behind in
his vapor trail.</TE>

<HD>BCS Matchups Are Problem, Not Bias</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Diane Pucin</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>If there is a bias here, it leans toward great college football bowl
games and against watching Miami stomp all over a ground-bound team
in a game that is supposed to decide which team is best in the
country but only proves that teams that never see good passers can't
stop good passers in the national title game.</LD>
<LD>   If there is a bias here, it leans toward nudging voters in
football polls to answer honestly the question, "Who is the best team
in the country this week? And who is second best, third best, fourth
best, this week?</LD>
<LD>   USC dominated Notre Dame after dominating UCLA after dominating
Arizona State. All three of those opponents will be playing in bowl
games. USC will play in a bowl game too, and the bias here is that
USC ends up where it deserves to play and, more important, where
college football fans deserve to see it play. And that doesn't mean
only Ohio State fans or Iowa fans or Georgia fans or Notre Dame fans.</LD>
<TE>   It seems as if, right now, today, Dec. 2, that USC is playing
football as well as or better than any team in the country. This
isn't to excuse USC's two losses but to notice that from those losses
USC got stronger.</TE>
<TE>   And according to BCS-ologists, there's a good chance the bowl
championship series rankings will move USC into the No. 4 spot, ahead
of Iowa. If this holds for another week, USC would have a guaranteed
BCS bowl berth.</TE>
<TE>   But the bias here is to see the best football teams challenged by
the best. Watching Ken Dorsey test USC's defense at the same time
Carson Palmer is testing the Miami defense, that's a challenge.</TE>
<TE>   Seeing whether the Hawkeye pass defense is for real and can stop
Palmer and his receivers -- Mike Williams, Kareem Kelly, Keary
Colbert, Alex Holmes, Malaefou MacKenzie, etc. -- that's intriguing.</TE>
<TE>   Finding out how USC and Georgia stack up. Against each other. Head
to head. That's interesting. Not so thrilling is USC getting stuck
playing four-loss Florida State.</TE>
<TE>   Is that bias?</TE>
<TE>   "After this game," USC senior cornerback Darrell Rideaux said
after the Notre Dame game Saturday, "I would hope we'd be judged
fairly. I hope people who saw us play this game will think about what
they saw."</TE>
<TE>   There's a fair request.</TE>
<TE>   What they saw Saturday was different from what they saw two months
ago. What they saw was a team that understands itself, is not
bothered by trouble or stymied by mistakes or discombobulated by
freak plays or "Irish magic."</TE>
<TE>   Not that there's a great deal of stock to be put in Internet fan
message boards, but they can provide a clue to the fans' temperature.
A week ago there was much boasting by Iowa faithful about how they'd
love to see USC in the Rose Bowl, if only to shut up anybody who
suggested USC might be the better team.</TE>
<TE>   This week there's hedging. "USC might be the worst matchup for
us," Hawkeye fans are saying. Clearly they have been paying
attention. "We might not match up against USC's receivers so well,"
they're saying. "Florida State, Miami, Ohio State, Georgia, Notre
Dame, USC, that's the order I like the matchups," one adds. "USC
might be tough for us."</TE>
<TE>   Is it bias to think it wouldn't be so much fun to watch Ohio State
find out it's not going to beat Miami 14-9 or 10-7 and then figure
out it can't score any more points while the Hurricanes are putting
up 30 because Miami throws the ball and, boy, that's not fair because
nobody else the Buckeyes played in the Big Ten did that?</TE>
<TE>   Is it bias to not want to listen to men wearing Orange coats
stammer and trip over themselves as they explain how Notre Dame is
their choice to play in Miami rather than USC or Iowa because, well,
hey, just because?</TE>
<TE>   "I'm so proud of what we've accomplished," MacKenzie said, "and
whatever happens with the bowls won't take away from how USC is going
back in the right direction.</TE>
<TE>   "But if we don't get into a BCS bowl, we won't have the
opportunity for a lot of people to see this team play. I think people
who haven't seen us play would enjoy that. And we won't get to
challenge ourselves one more time against a really good team."</TE>
<TE>   Hoping USC gets to play Iowa or Georgia or even Ohio State, if
enough weird things happen, is not bias. It's no different from being
pleased when the Angels made it to the baseball playoffs despite
their bad start because the Angels of October were much better than
the Angels of April. Missing the Angels of October challenge the
Yankees, the Twins and the Giants would have taken away from the
World Series.</TE>
<TE>   Where USC's season goes from here is no longer up to the Trojans.
It's also up to UCLA. If the Bruins beat Washington State on
Saturday, the Trojans get the Rose Bowl berth and maybe a chance to
prove themselves one more time against an Iowa team that can throw
and run the ball, just like USC, in what would become the most
attractive of the BCS bowl games.</TE>
<TE>   This Washington State game should mean something to UCLA too. Its
coach, Bob Toledo, has little credibility left among Bruin supporters
and it should make a difference to the players, having an 8-4 record
and finishing third in the Pac-10, rather than 7-5. The future seems
brighter for teams that don't quit.</TE>
<TE>   Or maybe it's up to Georgia and Miami. If both of them lose, USC
might sneak into the Fiesta Bowl and have a chance to play for the
national championship.</TE>
<TE>   The Trojans have done their best to prove they deserve a chance to
show one more time they are one of the best. No bias there, just the
truth.</TE>

<KH>BALTIMORE 27, CINCINNATI 23</KH>
<HD>Ravens Collect on Returns</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>CINCINNATI</DL>
<LD>Rookies Chad Williams and Ron Johnson scored touchdowns on returns,
and a Baltimore Raven defense missing Ray Lewis held on at the end in
a 27-23 victory over the Cincinnati Bengals on Sunday.</LD>
<LD>   The Ravens (6-6) opened the season with 19 first-year players on
the roster, the fallout from salary-cap problems that gutted a Super
Bowl team. Injuries to Lewis and others dropped them out of
contention at midseason.</LD>
<LD>   Heading down the stretch, the newcomers are reviving the playoff
talk.</LD>
<TE>   "The older guys are doing the big things, and the younger guys are
trying to figure out where we fit in," said Johnson, a fourth-round
pick. "You never want to give up on the playoffs. You never want to
lose that hope."</TE>
<TE>   Williams stepped in front of Corey Dillon and intercepted Jon
Kitna's pass, returning it 98 yards with 19 seconds left in the first
half, slipping through the quarterback's desperate attempt at a
tackle.</TE>
<TE>   "I was just being patient," Williams said.</TE>
<TE>   "When I made the pick, I wasn't thinking 98 yards; I was just
looking at Kitna. I didn't know how far 98 yards was."</TE>
<TE>   Williams also blocked Nick Harris' punt early in the fourth
quarter, deflecting the ball to Johnson on one bounce. He ran 22
yards unchallenged for the touchdown.</TE>

<KH>NEW ORLEANS 23, TAMPA BAY 20</KH>
<HD>Saints Have Bragging Rights Against Buccaneers</HD>
<DH></DH>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>NEW ORLEANS</DL>
<LD>The Tampa Bay Buccaneers and their league-leading defense may be
dominating the rest of the NFL. They can't dominate New Orleans.</LD>
<LD>   Despite a record-setting sacks performance by Tampa Bay's Simeon
Rice, the Saints ended the Buccaneers' four-game winning streak,
23-20, Sunday night.</LD>
<LD>   Aaron Brooks, playing despite a bruised throwing arm, threw two
touchdown passes in the first six minutes of the second half, while
the defense shut down the Buccaneer running game.</LD>
<TE>   It was the second win over Tampa Bay (9-3) by New Orleans, which
beat the Buccaneers, 26-20, in overtime on the opening day of the
season. And it made a three-team race of the NFC South; Tampa Bay
leads Atlanta (8-3-1) by a half-game and the Saints (8-4) by one
game.</TE>
<TE>   "This is kind of a round-robin," Saint Coach Jim Haslett said. "We
beat Tampa twice. Atlanta beat us twice. Hopefully, Tampa will beat
Atlanta next week and we'll just pass the thing around."</TE>
<TE>   "It was great," added Joe Horn, who caught one of Brooks'
touchdown passes. "Now we'll just let them and Atlanta fight it out.
This gets us back on track."</TE>
<TE>   Rice, the NFL's sacks leader at 14 1/2, took only five minutes to
get two sacks and set a record with five consecutive games with
multiple sacks. Six minutes later, he got a third, and it resulted in
a safety for a 2-0 lead.</TE>
<TE>   But the Saints' 26th-ranked defense played just as well, forcing
three turnovers and holding Tampa Bay to 34 yards rushing. The
Buccaneers, who came in leading the league with a plus-15 turnover
differential, forced only one turnover.</TE>
<TE>   "When you lose the turnover ratio on the road versus a good team,
I believe it's going to turn up biting you in the end," Buccaneer
Coach Jon Gruden said.</TE>
<TE>   New Orleans forced the Buccaneers to run nearly two minutes off
the clock from first-and-goal at the one before a two-yard
fourth-down touchdown pass from Brad Johnson to Keenan McCardell with
2:49 left. Brad Johnson connected with Keyshawn Johnson for a
two-point conversion that cut the deficit to 23-20.</TE>
<TE>   But Jake Delhomme, who replaced Brooks for the final series,
completed a 10-yard slant to Horn on third-and-eight from the 18
after the two-minute warning to clinch the game.</TE>
<TE>   "The big thing we did is stop the run," Saint defensive tackle
Norman Hand said.</TE>
<TE>   "That's exactly what we wanted to do. If you let them have both
things, you're in trouble."</TE>
<TE>   Brooks, who bruised his biceps on the last play of the first half,
completed only nine-of-25 passes for 155 yards. But with the Saints
trailing, 9-6, at the half, he threw touchdown passes of three yards
to Jake Reed and 14 yards to Horn on the first two possessions of the
third quarter.</TE>
<TE>   Saint running back Deuce McAllister had 99 yards in 27 carries to
go over the 1,000 yard mark.</TE>

<HD>Williams Is Faster Than Mercury</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Houston Mitchell</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Move over, Mercury Morris. Take that plaque out of your trophy case,
Lamar Smith. He might be a little shy, but Ricky Williams has no
problem removing you from the top of a category in the Miami
Dolphins' record book.</LD>
<LD>   Battling a cold wind and a slick field, Williams set a Dolphin
record with 228 yards rushing and scored two touchdowns in Miami's
38-21 loss to the Bills at Orchard Park, N.Y.</LD>
<LD>   The game began with a temperature of 25 degrees and ended in
near-whiteout conditions as a heavy snow fell through most of the
fourth quarter.</LD>
<TE>   "I've been preparing for it since Monday. I'd check on my phone to
see the forecast and look on the computer every chance I had,"
Williams said of the weather. "I was a little nervous about it. It
was cold and miserable, but we did a good job up front and it made my
job easy."</TE>
<TE>   Looks like Ricky didn't let the 17-point loss interfere with his
enjoyment of his records.</TE>
<TE>   The Dolphins, who lost quarterback Ray Lucas to a nerve injury in
his neck, couldn't be carried by Williams alone. Williams scored on
45- and 55-yard runs and broke the single-game franchise record held
by Smith, who rushed for 209 yards in a playoff game against
Indianapolis on Dec. 30, 2000. Morris held the regular-season record,
rushing for 197 yards against New England on Sept. 30, 1973.</TE>
<TE>   Williams also set a single-season Dolphin record with 1,284 yards,
beating the mark of 1,258 set by Delvin Williams in 1978.</TE>
<TE>   Ricky Williams was well short of a less-glorious NFL record: His
rushing total was the second-most by a player in a loss. O.J. Simpson
set the mark with 273 yards in Buffalo's 27-14 loss to Detroit on
Nov. 25, 1976.</TE>
<TE>   Oh, and for those of you wondering what Larry Csonka's best
rushing game was for the Dolphins, it was 145 yards against Minnesota
in Super Bowl VIII, a 24-7 victory. His season high was 1,117 yards,
set in 1972.</TE>
<TE>   Williams, in his first season with the Dolphins after spending
three with New Orleans, also moved into the top six all-time in the
most rushing yards for a player in his first year with a club. The
top five: 1. Priest Holmes, 2001 Kansas City, 1,555 yards; 2. Jerome
Bettis, 1996 Pittsburgh, 1,431; 3. Marshall Faulk, 1999 St. Louis,
1,381; 4. Terry Allen, 1995 Washington, 1,309; 5. Curtis Martin, 1998
New York Jets, 1,287.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   It was a day for records across the NFL. Some of the more notable:</TE>
<TE>   * Tampa Bay defensive end Simeon Rice set an NFL record by getting
at least two sacks for the fifth consecutive game.</TE>
<TE>   Rice, who began Sunday's game against New Orleans leading the
league with 11 1/2 sacks, got to Saint quarterback Aaron Brooks on
consecutive plays during the first quarter.</TE>
<TE>   The sacks came after the Saints had reached the Tampa Bay 15. On
second and 10, Rice dumped Brooks for a one-yard loss, then followed
it up by chasing him out of the pocket and tackling him 14 yards
behind the line of scrimmage. Rice beat Saint left tackle Kyle Turley
on both plays. He finished the game with three sacks and a safety.</TE>
<TE>   Rice shared the record of four consecutive multi-sack games with
Reggie White (Philadelphia in 1987) and Kevin Greene (Carolina in
1998).</TE>
<TE>   * Indianapolis' Marvin Harrison caught a nine-yard pass with 10:15
left in the 19-3 victory over Houston, tying Raymond Berry's club
record for receptions (631).</TE>
<TE>   Berry, a Hall of Famer, played for the Colts from 1955 to 1967.
Harrison is in his seventh season.</TE>
<TE>   Last week, Harrison became the first player in NFL history to
produce four consecutive 100-reception seasons, and he already has
broken Berry's team record for touchdown receptions. Harrison has 70,
Berry had 68.</TE>
<TE>   * Tennessee running back Eddie George set the franchise's career
rushing record with a four-yard run in the first quarter of a 32-29
win over the New York Giants.</TE>
<TE>   George came into the game needing four yards to surpass the mark
of 8,574, set by Earl Campbell from 1978 to 1984, when the team was
known as the Houston Oilers.</TE>
<TE>   George got a yard on the first play from scrimmage and broke the
mark with a run off right tackle. He has 8,635 yards after gaining 64
yards in 20 carries.</TE>
<TE>   Said George: "It's a great honor to break Earl Campbell's record.
He played so many years before me and I watched him when I was
younger."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Kansas City's 49-0 win over Arizona, the worst loss in the
recorded history of the Cardinals franchise, spurred an apology from
Chiefs' Coach Dick Vermeil to Cardinal Coach Dave McGinnis.</TE>
<TE>   The Chiefs increased their lead to 49-0 with 7:52 remaining in the
game when Todd Collins connected with Marc Boerigter on a 29-yard
touchdown pass play.</TE>
<TE>   "I'd like to apologize to Dave McGinnis about that last
touchdown," Vermeil said. "I don't think it was a real good call, and
if I had heard, I should have stopped the call. I would just as soon
not score, because I have a lot of respect for Dave and his coaches."</TE>
<TE>   What was Vermeil doing on the sideline that was more important
than paying attention to what plays were being called? It's enough to
make a grown man cry.</TE>

<HD>O'Meara Comes Out on Top in Skins Game</HD>
<DH>Mickelson, looking somewhat chummy with Woods, is second in
winnings after collecting $300,000 in the two-day event.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Thomas Bonk</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>INDIO, Calif.</DL>
<LD>Since money is no object at the Skins Game, not with a mere $1
million at stake, here are Sunday's highlights from Landmark Golf
Club ... other than Mark O'Meara making $405,000:</LD>
<LD>   * A fan snaps a photograph of Tiger Woods in the middle of his
downswing from the bunker at the 18th hole. Tiger yells, "Not in my
swing!" Tiger then curses. Tiger's caddie then snatches the camera
from the fan and heaves it in the lake.</LD>
<LD>   * A jackrabbit runs down the 16th fairway and Fred Couples comes
close to collecting an unusual skin by smacking it with his golf
ball. "Two shocks," Couples says of the shot. "One, it was down the
middle of the fairway, and two, it was a small target."</LD>
<TE>   * At the 18th green, after Phil Mickelson's tap-in putt worth
$200,000 ended the day, Woods hugged him, a show of affection that
seemed to contradict their supposed feud. What's next? Double-dating?
Carpooling?</TE>
<TE>   And so it went at the 20th edition of the Skins Game, where
everybody walked away a winner, sort of, and most likely happy, which
is what should happen when they're passing out money.</TE>
<TE>   O'Meara was the biggest winner of all, picking up five more skins
Sunday, finishing with eight and probably displaying the best sense
of timing. That was when he had a three-hole carry-over at the par
three 15th worth $210,000. After guiding a six-iron to 3 feet, he
rolled in the putt for the dough.</TE>
<TE>   Afterward, O'Meara showed the proper attitude.</TE>
<TE>   "The Skins Game is kind of anybody's game," he said. "I'm just
happy to be this year's champion."</TE>
<TE>   Mickelson was happy to avoid getting skunked Sunday. Until the
last hole, Mickelson's golf ball was directionally challenged. It was
not traditional golf he was playing, he said, but something else
entirely.</TE>
<TE>   "Jungle golf," Mickelson called it.</TE>
<TE>   But at the 563-yard closing hole, Mickelson's five-iron from 215
yards put him 30 feet from the hole and looking at an eagle putt.
O'Meara was already out of the hole and so was Couples, who drove
into some tumbleweed and left his second shot in the same tall grass.</TE>
<TE>   Said Couples: "To play out of the shrubs is disappointing."</TE>
<TE>   Here's betting the $170,000 Couples made makes him feel a lot
better.</TE>
<TE>   Woods was in the right greenside bunker in two, but he flinched at
the sound of the camera when he was swinging and ran the ball 8 feet
past the hole.</TE>
<TE>   Tiger's blowup was not as colorful as most, but then this was not
a tour event either.</TE>
<TE>   "It was right behind me," Woods said of the camera. "I was lucky
just to keep the ball on the green."</TE>
<TE>   Mickelson's first putt left him a foot short and he tapped in,
then waited to see if Woods would tie him.</TE>
<TE>   But Tiger missed, it was over, and they started adding up the
money before getting out of town as soon as possible.</TE>
<TE>   Mickelson, who made $100,000 on the last hole Saturday, made
$200,000 on the last hole Sunday and banked $300,000 with a total of
three skins. Couples was next with three skins and his $170,000 and
Woods had four skins worth $125,000.</TE>
<TE>   They each said they had a good time playing golf for money, which
someone else was kind enough to contribute, although Couples seemed
annoyed he didn't finish better.</TE>
<TE>   "The last hole was terrible, but I'm happy to get out of here with
some money," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "It wasn't that bad," Mickelson said.</TE>
<TE>   "It was good for you," Couples said.</TE>
<TE>   As it turns out, this special event stuff is good for everybody
involved.</TE>
<TE>   This week, they're moving the show to Sherwood Country Club, for a
$3.8-million tournament sponsored by Target and hosted by Woods.
Mickelson, O'Meara and Woods are all playing in it and Couples will
be there to play in the pro-am.</TE>

<HD>Lazio Starting Talks With Murdoch</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Grahame L. Jones</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Rupert Murdoch, whose billion-dollar bid to buy Manchester United
three years ago was thwarted by the British government, is about to
launch a far more modest effort to purchase the Italian Serie A team
Lazio.</LD>
<LD>   According to Gazzetta dello Sport, top Murdoch lieutenants will
meet with Lazio officials in Rome today to begin negotiations.</LD>
<LD>   Sergio Cragnotti, Lazio's president, put the 102-year-old club up
for sale last month after its parent company, international food
giant Cirio, defaulted on more than $1 billion in bonds.</LD>
<TE>   Cragnotti is said to be asking about $150 million for the
debt-ridden team, which moved into first place in Italy on Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier, Al Saadi Kadafi, the son of Libyan leader Moammar Kadafi,
had expressed interest in buying the club, but has since rejected the
idea.</TE>
<TE>   Italian Violence</TE>
<TE>   Only two weeks after a fan attacked Messina goalkeeper Emanuele
Manitta and knocked him unconscious, another Italian player, Napoli
defender Francesco Baldini, was ambushed in his car by Napoli fans
after a 0-0 tie with Palermo in Naples.</TE>
<TE>   In the Friday night incident, fans smashed the vehicle's windows
with iron bars and also attacked Baldini, who suffered cuts and
bruises but was not seriously hurt.</TE>
<TE>   The fans allegedly had been angered by the Serie B club's poor
play.</TE>
<TE>   The latest incident has caused Sergio Campagna, president of the
Italian players' association, to demand a meeting with Italian soccer
federation officials in an effort to stop fan violence.</TE>
<TE>   In an unrelated incident Sunday, an unidentified 30-year-old man
suffered severe head injuries when he fell from the stands before
Bologna's home game against Modena.</TE>
<TE>   Argentine Title</TE>
<TE>   Goals by Federico Insua, Andres Silvera and Lucas Pusineri earned
Independiente a 3-0 victory at San Lorenzo on Sunday and clinched the
Argentine league title for the team, its first championship in eight
years.</TE>
<TE>   Brazil Playoffs</TE>
<TE>   Fluminense and Santos moved a step closer to winning the Brazilian
league championship Sunday when they each scored shutout victories in
the first games of the two-game semifinal playoff series.</TE>
<TE>   A goal by Romario in the 77th minute was enough for Fluminense to
beat Corinthians, 1-0, at Maracana Stadium on a scorching day in Rio
de Janeiro.</TE>
<TE>   Santos, seeking its first title in 18 years, dismantled Gremio,
3-0, with Alberto scoring twice and Robinho adding a third.</TE>
<TE>   The second semifinal matches will be played Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   Benfica's Pick</TE>
<TE>   Jose Antonio Camacho, who coached Spain into the quarterfinals of
the 2002 World Cup before resigning, has been confirmed as coach of
Benfica in Portugal.</TE>
<TE>   "It is a great honor to serve an institution like Benfica, a
mythical name in world football," Camacho said. "It is also a great
professional challenge."</TE>
<TE>   Benfica, a former European champion, has not won a Portuguese
league championship since 1993.</TE>
<TE>   Zamalek Poised</TE>
<TE>   Four-time African champion Zamalek of Egypt is poised to win the
African Champions League for a fifth time after earning a 0-0 tie on
the road against Raja Casablanca of Morocco on Saturday in the first
match of the two-match final.</TE>
<TE>   Concentrating almost entirely on defense, the Cairo club managed
to keep a crowd of 75,000 out of the game and goes into the second
match in Egypt on Dec. 13 with a good chance of adding to the titles
it won in 1984, 1986, 1993 and 1996.</TE>
<TE>   Briegel Ponders</TE>
<TE>   Hans-Peter Briegel, who played 72 games for Germany and was a
member of its 1980 European Championship-winning side, is considering
an offer to coach Albania's national team.</TE>

<HD>Steelers Cash In on Reed's Kick Six</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>JACKSONVILLE, Fla.</DL>
<LD>The Pittsburgh Steelers are set at kicker for their playoff push. The
quarterback position is a more interesting story.</LD>
<LD>   Kordell Stewart made a bid to get his job back for good Sunday,
and recently signed rookie Jeff Reed made all six of his field-goal
attempts to lift the Steelers to a 25-23 victory over the
Jacksonville Jaguars.</LD>
<LD>   "It's nice to have a very dependable kicker," Steeler Coach Bill
Cowher said.</LD>
<TE>   Reed's sixth field goal, a 50-yarder, gave Pittsburgh (7-4-1) a
25-17 lead with 4:30 left.</TE>
<TE>   Mark Brunell and the Jaguars (5-7) answered with a 65-yard
touchdown drive to cut the deficit to two with 1:16 left. But the
Steelers' defense stopped the Jaguars on the two-point try when
Dewayne Washington broke up the pass Brunell threw into heavy
coverage to Jimmy Smith.</TE>
<TE>   The Steelers, 6-1-1 in their last eight games, expanded their lead
to 1 1/2 games over Baltimore and Cleveland in the AFC North.</TE>
<TE>   Stewart, who regained the starting job after Tommy Maddox's scary
injury two weeks ago, threw for 202 yards and ran for 84 more and the
team's lone touchdown.</TE>
<TE>   The next decision for Cowher is who starts the next game against
Houston. "I'm not going to worry about that right now," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Maddox, who has been cleared to play but entered the game only as
Reed's holder, said "you're asking the wrong person," when asked
whether he thought he would get his job back.</TE>
<TE>   Stewart also didn't want to get involved in guessing games.</TE>
<TE>   "I have no clue," he said. "I'm not in Bill's head."</TE>
<TE>   The kicking situation is much more concrete.</TE>
<TE>   Reed, a rookie from North Carolina, was signed two weeks ago when
Todd Peterson was placed on injured reserve with cracked ribs. In his
pro debut last week, he made two of three field goal attempts, but
missed an extra point that almost proved critical in a 29-21 victory
over Cincinnati. The Bengals were driving at the end with a chance to
tie.</TE>
<TE>   There were no such misses this time. Reed was successful from 25,
29, 30, 46, 33 yards and then made the 50-yarder. The sixth kick tied
the 14-year-old franchise record set by Gary Anderson.</TE>
<TE>   Playing the second half with a broken nose, the Steelers' Jerome
Bettis ran for 86 yards to reach 11,459 for his career and pass John
Riggins for 10th place on the NFL career rushing list.</TE>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>SAN JOSE</DL>
<LD>The San Jose Sharks fired Coach Darryl Sutter and assistants Lorne
Molleken and Rich Preston on Sunday in a dramatic shake-up of a
slumping team.</LD>
<LD>   Doug Wilson, the Sharks' director of pro development, and scout
Cap Raeder will coach the team until a new coach is named.</LD>
<LD>   With San Jose off to an 8-12-2-2 start, General Manager Dean
Lombardi decided to replace Sutter, who had led the Sharks to five
consecutive seasons of improved point totals while helping to build
them into a Stanley Cup contender.</LD>
<TE>   San Jose became a consistent winner in Sutter's tenure, but he
couldn't accomplish much this season with an underachieving club
that's been one of the NHL's biggest disappointments.</TE>
<TE>   "Darryl was an integral part of the growth of this team the past
five seasons," Lombardi said. "This was not an easy decision to
make."</TE>
<TE>   Following Saturday night's 3-2 home loss to Phoenix, the Sharks
are in last place in the Pacific Division, which they won last
season.</TE>
<TE>   San Jose got off to a slow start while goalie Evgeni Nabokov and
defenseman Brad Stuart held out, but their returns haven't helped.
The Sharks have struggled to score and they have allowed more goals
than any division team except Phoenix.</TE>

<HD>Bowl Consequences Don't Faze Bruins</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>Steve Henson</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It's not as if Bob Toledo wakes up and says, "What can I do today to
help USC."</LD>
<LD>   And it's safe to say it has never occurred to the UCLA coach to
make life simpler for Orange Bowl officials.</LD>
<LD>   But a Bruin victory over Washington State on Saturday would vault
the Trojans into the Rose Bowl and free the Orange Bowl to choose
Notre Dame or another team that would bring more fans than USC.</LD>
<TE>   Toledo, of course, has his own reasons for wanting to win. So does
his team.</TE>
<TE>   The sour taste of a 52-21 loss to USC on Nov. 23 has lingered and
would be diminished by an upset of the No. 7 Cougars (9-2).</TE>
<TE>   "That's really the only way to put the [USC loss] behind us,"
Bruin receiver Craig Bragg said. "Come out and beat Washington State
and win a bowl game."</TE>
<TE>   Doing so would give the Bruins (7-4) more than seven victories for
the first time since 1998 and could provide Toledo with a measure of
security. Indications are that first-year Athletic Director Dan
Guerrero is pleased with most aspects of the coach's job performance,
but a late-season tailspin could force a change because it would mark
the fifth consecutive season that UCLA has faded down the stretch.</TE>
<TE>   "We have a chance to win eight games, which is something this
senior class has never done," Toledo said. "With a bowl game, we have
a chance to win nine, and that would be a good season.</TE>
<TE>   "Look back at the beginning of the season, we were picked to
finish sixth [in the Pacific 10 Conference]. Right now, we have a
chance to finish third."</TE>
<TE>   Tied for third, anyway. The Bruins are 4-3 in Pac-10 games, a
half-game behind third-place Arizona State.</TE>
<TE>   A loss to Washington State, however, drops UCLA into a four-way
tie for fourth place. The Bruins would still go to one of the six
bowl games that have contracts with the Pac-10 because one of the 4-4
teams -- California -- is on NCAA probation and ineligible for a
bowl.</TE>
<TE>   It's impossible to tell where UCLA will end up because there is no
tie-breaking criteria -- every bowl besides the Rose picks who it
wants in case of a tie.</TE>
<TE>   A UCLA victory would drop Washington State into the Holiday Bowl,
which gets the second-place Pac-10 team.</TE>
<TE>   The Sun Bowl, which takes the third-place team, would choose
between UCLA and Arizona State. The Insight Bowl would get the team
the Sun doesn't pick.</TE>
<TE>   A UCLA loss would put Washington State in the Rose Bowl and leave
USC hoping for an at-large bowl championship series bid from the
Orange or Sugar bowls.</TE>
<TE>   If USC gets a BCS game, Arizona State would go to the Holiday Bowl
and the Bruins would be standing next to Oregon State (4-4) and
Washington (4-4). The Sun gets first pick, the Insight second and the
Las Vegas Bowl takes the third.</TE>
<TE>   If USC doesn't get a BCS game, it goes to the Holiday Bowl,
Arizona State drops to the Sun Bowl and the same three 4-4 teams are
chosen, in order, by the Insight, Las Vegas and Silicon Valley bowls.</TE>

<KH>USC REWIND</KH>
<HD>Bowl Spot Is a Wait-and-See Situation</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Gary Klein</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>USC's regular season is complete. Bowl matchups will not be
determined for another week.</LD>
<LD>   The Trojans, therefore, will play the waiting game during the next
five days.</LD>
<LD>   That's fine with the Trojans, who on Sunday parlayed their 44-13
rout of Notre Dame into a No. 5 ranking in both the Associated Press
and ESPN/USA Today polls.</LD>
<TE>   USC players will take most of this week off before three days of
practice beginning Friday. The Trojans are tentatively scheduled to
practice 11 times in the next three weeks.</TE>
<TE>   "We'll practice on weekends the first couple of weeks because the
coaches will be on the road recruiting," said Coach Pete Carroll, who
spent much of Sunday visiting with out-of-state recruits who were at
the Coliseum for Saturday night's demolition of the Fighting Irish.
"We want to keep it together and keep making progress."</TE>
<TE>   The Trojans, who began training camp in mid-August, welcome the
respite.</TE>
<TE>   "It's going to be nice to have a few days off and concentrate on
school with finals coming up," linebacker Matt Grootegoed said. "It's
going to take awhile to let this all sink in. But we're not done
yet."</TE>
<TE>   USC players fully expect that they will be rewarded for their 10-2
season with a berth in the Rose Bowl or another bowl championship
series game.</TE>
<TE>   The Trojans' losses during their best season since 1988 came
against Kansas State and Washington State, currentlyranked sixth and
seventh, respectively. USC won seven consecutive games after the
overtime defeat against Washington State on Oct. 5, and finished with
routs over UCLA and Notre Dame.</TE>
<TE>   Saturday's victory over the Fighting Irish could move USC past
Iowa to No. 4 in the BCS standings that will be released today.</TE>
<TE>   "Whatever happens with the BCS, it's out of our hands," safety
Troy Polamalu said. "I think we proved what we needed to."</TE>
<TE>   USC's bowl fate could be decided by UCLA when the Bruins play
Washington State on Saturday. If UCLA wins, USC claims the Pacific 10
Conference championship outright and earns an automatic Rose Bowl
berth.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think there will be any USC fans in L.A. [on Saturday],"
Polamalu said. "We'll all be UCLA fans, for once."</TE>
<TE>   If Washington State wins, USC could play in the Orange or Sugar
bowls. And if Miami and Georgia lose Saturday, the Fiesta Bowl is
also a possibility.</TE>
<TE>   But Carroll remains unconcerned about where the Trojans might
ultimately land.</TE>
<TE>   Like all coaches, Carroll is looking forward to bowl game
practices because they offer an extra opportunity to teach and
evaluate players heading into spring practice.</TE>
<TE>   Carroll said competition for positions next season will begin this
week for players such as redshirt linebackers Frostee Rucker and Lofa
Tatupu.</TE>
<TE>   Quarterbacks Matt Cassel, Matt Leinart, Billy Hart and redshirt
Brandon Hance will take the majority of snaps while Heisman Trophy
candidate Carson Palmer travels the postseason awards circuit in a
few weeks.</TE>
<TE>   Carroll added that the magnitude of the victories over UCLA and
Notre Dame was still sinking in. USC defeated its rivals in the same
season for the first time since 1981 and the first time in
consecutive games since 1978.</TE>
<TE>   "I realize that the fans and the people who have been around the
program so long, that have seen the years go by without this
happening, it hits them differently," he said. "I try to appreciate
that."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   USC's combined 62-point margin of victory over UCLA and Notre Dame
is the highest ever against the two rivals, surpassing the 56-point
margin in 1974.... The Trojans scored 30 points or more in their last
seven games, the first time a USC team achieved the feat since 1972.</TE>

<DH>Gonzaga coach declined Washington job as the two programs'
fortunes diverge</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Robyn Norwood</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>SPOKANE, Wash</DL>
<LD>SPOKANE, Wash. -- The way some people tell it, Gonzaga Coach Mark Few
turned down the Washington Huskies' job offer, then turned around and
turned them in for recruiting violations.</LD>
<LD>   There's a little more to the story, but it makes for a pretty
lively rivalry as the teams meet tonight on Gonzaga's campus.</LD>
<LD>   This is the case of a 4,700-student Jesuit school from the West
Coast Conference outdoing the state's two Pacific 10 universities.
Last season, the Zags beat Washington by 20 points and Washington
State by 23 in consecutive December games.</LD>
<TE>   Little wonder that after Gonzaga's rise to No. 6 in the nation
ended with a thud in a first-round NCAA tournament loss, Washington
Athletic Director Barbara Hedges tried to hire Few to replace Bob
Bender.</TE>
<TE>   Few turned Washington down -- along with the money and glamour of
the Pac-10 -- to stay at Gonzaga, where the beloved Zags play in a
4,000-seat gym.</TE>
<TE>   "It really causes you to be introspective," Few said. "You have to
look deep into your soul, what you want out of life. That's not that
fun. I'd rather cruise along in superficial waters, fishing, playing
with my kids and coaching my team.</TE>
<TE>   "To me, it came down to more personal things, like 'OK, you've got
to go look Cory [Violette] and Blake [Stepp] in the eye and tell them
you're leaving.' "</TE>
<TE>   Instead, he stayed, and the job of trying to revive a Washington
program that has finished in the bottom half of the conference 10 of
the last 15 years fell to Lorenzo Romar, the onetime Husky guard and
former UCLA assistant who most recently coached at Pepperdine and
Saint Louis.</TE>
<TE>   It hasn't been a pretty start. Romar's team is 0-2 after losses to
Montana State and Nevada Las Vegas. (No. 20 Gonzaga is 2-2, but the
losses were to No. 19 Indiana and No. 15 Kentucky.)</TE>
<TE>   Romar hadn't even coached his first practice before trouble hit.</TE>
<TE>   Assistant coach Cameron Dollar, the former Bruin point guard, was
caught breaking NCAA rules in a rash of overzealous recruiting,
mostly consisting of improper contacts and phone calls with
Washington high school players who had not yet completed their junior
years. Some say Dollar was fortunate he wasn't fired. Instead, he
served a one-month suspension, was docked more than $13,000 in salary
and cannot recruit off-campus until July 1.</TE>
<TE>   "I made poor decisions and showed poor judgment," a contrite
Dollar said at the October news conference announcing Washington's
self-imposed penalties. "Bottom line, I blew it."</TE>
<TE>   He missed the first month of practice before returning from his
suspension.</TE>
<TE>   "It definitely was a setback for us," Romar said. "Initially, I
think he was embarrassed, disappointed in himself. He's a fighter.
He's always been a fighter."</TE>
<TE>   Gonzaga's role in the saga is that the school was listed along
with Washington State and Eastern Washington in published reports as
the ones that turned in Washington to the NCAA.</TE>
<TE>   Not exactly, Few says.</TE>
<TE>   "It gets misconstrued a little bit," he said. "You don't turn
anybody in. If [NCAA investigators] come to your campus, you answer
some questions. I didn't really have any answers to lead them to
anything. I think most of the damage was found by them going to
Washington to ask questions, look at phone records, and by asking
specific recruits questions. People painted it as all the schools in
the eastern part of the state [reporting Washington to the NCAA]."</TE>
<TE>   Romar speaks delicately about the matter, saying he has known Few
a long time and little more than that.</TE>
<TE>   Few acknowledges the situation probably has caused some strain the
coaches will feel when they shake hands tonight.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm sure it has," Few said. "We just have to work through it. I
certainly don't look at him in a different light.</TE>
<TE>   "Lorenzo will do a great job for them. He's a great recruiter and
a hard worker."</TE>
<TE>   It will take hard work to get the Washington program back to where
it was in the final years under Coach Marv Harshman, whose 1984 and
'85 teams led by Detlef Schrempf tied for the Pac-10 title and
reached the NCAA tournament. (Years earlier, Washington reached the
Final Four in 1953, and in a Hollywood fantasy, won the NCAA title in
the 1997 film "The Sixth Man.")</TE>
<TE>   Most people agree that the Huskies seemed on the brink of
something big under Bender in 1998, when only a last-second basket by
Connecticut's Richard Hamilton off an offensive rebound kept
11th-seeded Washington from reaching the NCAA tournament's Elite
Eight.</TE>
<TE>   Washington never seemed to recover, reaching the tournament again
the next season with a team led by Todd MacCulloch, only to be upset
in the first round by Miami of Ohio.</TE>
<TE>   Three losing seasons later, Bender was gone.</TE>
<TE>   Doug Wrenn, a junior gunner who had four 30-point games for the
Huskies last season after transferring back to his home state from
Connecticut, says Hamilton still taunts him about what that shot did
to the Husky program.</TE>
<TE>   "He says, 'My shot caused your demise. You could have been going
to the Elite Eight,' " said Wrenn, still in high school at the time.
"But we're going to be back. We're going to get back to where we
were."</TE>
<TE>   The early omens for this season aren't good, not with Romar
benching Wrenn for nearly the final four minutes of a three-point
loss to Montana State for what he called "family business,"
apparently a reference to Wrenn not displaying the leadership Romar
wanted.</TE>
<TE>   Romar is focused on rebuilding through recruiting, and that means
doing a better job with players from the state who have been going
elsewhere, a talent drain that dates at least to the days of Jason
Terry and Michael Dickerson signing with Arizona.</TE>
<TE>   Oregon's Luke Ridnour also is from Washington, and Dan Dickau --
Gonzaga's star last season -- started his career as a Husky before
transferring. Yet another talented former Husky guard, Erroll Knight,
will play for Gonzaga next season after sitting out under NCAA
transfer rules this season.</TE>
<TE>   Romar believes the flow of good players to other programs already
has been slowed -- and unlike Richard Hamilton, he likes to find the
positive side of that loss to Connecticut.</TE>
<TE>   "The context I use that shot in is, 'Don't tell me we can't get to
the Final Four. If Rip Hamilton doesn't tip that shot in, we'd have
been in the final eight,' " Romar said.</TE>
<TE>   Few is hardly one to say any program can't get to the Sweet
Sixteen, Elite Eight or even beyond. After all, look at Gonzaga.</TE>
<TE>   He did, which is why he is in Spokane instead of Seattle.</TE>
<TE>   "[Washington] is a heck of a school and program, resource-wise,
and so is the city, recruiting-wise," said Few, whose credentials
include an 81-20 record and the most victories in his first three
seasons by a Division I coach.</TE>
<TE>   "But where we are right now, I thought it would take three or four
years [at Washington] to get to where we are here."</TE>
<TE>   If he eventually leaves, it might be because of something like his
frustration with the effect of playing in the West Coast Conference
on Gonzaga's RPI rating. (His rant last season about the detrimental
effect of the WCC tournament on NCAA seeding drew a response: After a
format change, the league's top two teams now waltz into the
semifinals on byes, needing only two victories for an automatic NCAA
bid.)</TE>
<TE>   Or maybe it will be the lure of more money, though that didn't get
him last year when Washington might have doubled his salary.</TE>
<TE>   "We're all competitive. We all want to compete for the national
championship," Few said. "And I'm not sure we can't do that here with
the type of guys we have and the guys we have coming in here. I'm
just not convinced there's better situations, or many better
situations out there, than this.</TE>
<TE>   "You never know until the situation comes up. You try to be honest
with recruits. You never say never. To me, it comes down to having an
opportunity to win a national championship. And I believe we can
compete for one up here."</TE>

<LD>The return of guard Michelle Greco continues to give UCLA hope that a
winning season is possible after two straight disappointing seasons.</LD>
<LD>   The Bruins continued to look like a rejuvenated team, defeating
previously unbeaten Nevada Las Vegas on Sunday, 72-64, to win the
Lady Rebel Shootout at Thomas &amp; Mack Center.</LD>
<LD>   Greco, a senior, who sat out most of last season because of
concussions, had 26 points and five rebounds for UCLA (3-1), which
won its third straight game.</LD>
<TE>   Guard Gennifer Arranaga and forward Whitney Jones came off the
bench to score 12 and 10 points, respectively.</TE>
<TE>   Senior guard Constance Jinks had 26 points for UNLV (3-1).</TE>
<TE>   UCLA shot 76% -- making 19 of 25 shots -- to take a 41-34 halftime
lead. The Bruins would never trail again after taking a 31-28 lead on
a three-pointer by Greco with 4:29 remaining in the half.</TE>
<TE>   The Rebels outrebounded UCLA, 43-30, but the Bruins more than made
up the difference at the foul line, making 17 of 24 free throws. By
contrast, the Rebels made only six of 17 free throws and shot 39.4%
from the field.</TE>
<TE>   Greco, who moved past Janae Hubbard into 10th place on the
all-time UCLA scoring list Sunday, was named the tournament most
valuable player.</TE>

<TE>   In a rematch of last season's NCAA final, Diana Taurasi scored 30
points to lead No. 5 Connecticut to a 73-60 victory over No. 23
Oklahoma in the championship game of the Rainbow Wahine Classic in
Honolulu. Taurasi was 12 for 19 from the field, including four for
six from three-point range. Connecticut (5-0) led, 44-22, at
halftime. Maria Villaroel scored 27 points for the Sooners (5-2)....
Gwen Jackson and Kara Lawson scored 14 points each to lead No. 4
Tennessee (5-1) over Saint Louis, 75-40, on the final day of the San
Juan Shootout at Carolina, Puerto Rico, but the Lady Vols may have
lost forward Brittany Jackson for the season. Jackson collided with
an opponent with 29 seconds left and may have damaged ligaments in
her left knee.... No. 6 Purdue (5-0) shot only 38%, but defeated
Southern Mississippi, 65-53, in a nonconference game at Hattiesburg,
Miss. The Boilermakers held the Eagles (2-2) to 39% shooting.... No.
9 Vanderbilt (4-0), led, 42-15, at halftime and went on to rout
Harvard, 84-44, in the championship game of the First Tennessee
Tournament at Nashville.... La'Tangela Atkinson scored 19 points and
No. 11 North Carolina (4-0) beat Hawaii (3-2), 61-50, in the
third-place game of the Rainbow Wahine Classic.... Cathy Joens scored
28 points to lead No. 21 George Washington (2-1) to a 78-37 victory
over Virginia Commonwealth in a nonconference game at Washington.</TE>
