<LD>Benjamin Ford, son of Harrison, is sitting in a corner at his
restaurant, Chadwick, in Beverly Hills. He's recuperating with a
glass of white wine after attending the previous night's premiere
party for his father's latest movie, "K-19: The Widowmaker."</LD>
<LD>   On this night, Ford, 36, is host of a party for another Hollywood
offspring: Alison Eastwood, daughter of Clint, who is launching a
clothing line. The evening's theme: "Denim, Tapas and Tequila." It's
a long way from Chadwick's usual fare: California cuisine in
Craftsman-style surroundings. (The restaurant is named after Alice
Waters' mentor, organic gardening guru Alan Chadwick.)</LD>
<LD>   In a few moments, celebrities and photographers will swarm the
small restaurant on Beverly Drive, and Ford--one of the few not in
western gear (he's wearing his chef's jacket with his name
embroidered in blue)--is taking a moment before the party begins.</LD>
<TE>   He rarely uses his restaurant for publicity parties because he
doesn't want to alienate his regular customers or the neighbors, he
says. And he would rather cook than play Hollywood host.</TE>
<TE>   "I'd like this to be a Brooks Brothers kind of restaurant," he
jokes about Chadwick.</TE>
<TE>   A publicist tugs at his sleeve, and he peels off for more
interviews on the red carpet outside the restaurant.</TE>
<TE>   The evening's western motif is completed by the arrival of the
iconic celluloid gunslinger--Clint. Within minutes, he's surrounded
by gushing women. "This is fun," he says about the party, and his
daughter's new fashion venture. The shirt he's wearing, a
sand-colored number with a bolo tie, is from his daughter's line,
Eastwood Ranch, he says. The rest is just Eastwood.</TE>
<TE>   He looks at guests in skimpy country-western gear around him. "It
never seems to go out of style," he says.</TE>
<TE>   Ford and Clint Eastwood are introduced, and pose for photos in the
kitchen. Eastwood joins his daughter, and his son, Kyle, for a family
get-together on the back patio where jeans on a clothesline provide
the decoration above the bar.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Ford has another interview in the kitchen, and as an
"Entertainment Tonight" cameraman shoots B-roll of the chef, another
crew member polishes off an entire tray of filet mignon appetizers.</TE>
<TE>   As the evening draws to a close, Ford and his guests convene in
the kitchen. An apprentice is flipping cheese sandwiches on a
skillet.</TE>
<TE>   In the main dining room, a Beverly Hills police officer makes his
rounds. "It's better than what I get at home--that's usually jelly
and peanut butter sandwiches," he says, as he finishes the remaining
tapas.</TE>
<TE>   'Round the Block Fun</TE>
<TE>   There was hardly room inside the posh Rodeo Drive boutique for a
lady to sip from her mini-bottle of Piper-Heidsieck champagne.
Well-heeled managers of the exclusive shopping district's designer
stores avoided the passed hors d'oeuvres, presumably to keep from
tarnishing a $4,500 sequined gown with the remnants of a pate tarte.</TE>
<TE>   The store owners and designers Mark Badgley and James Mischka
stood stiffly near the jeweled handbags, greeting select guests with
a quick handshake. "Ciao bella!" shouted a man near the door to
Italian American actress Jo Champa. Her sundress fluttered as she
glided through the crowd. When a guest asked her about traveling in
the Italian province of Calabria, Champa described entire villages
moved to cook feasts for her and her husband, movie market researcher
Joseph Farrell. "In Italy, I'm a celebrity," she explained. While
models compared their Badgley-Mischka gowns at the door, a tall
gentleman in a beige suit and sunglasses attempted to crash the
party. "It's a private party, sir," said a man monitoring the guest
list. "So you're telling me I can't come in?" the crasher asked,
peering inside and moving closer. "I'm sorry, sir."</TE>
<TE>   This is how Beverly Hills celebrates the unveiling of plans for
its biannual $1,000-per-ticket block party known as the "Tribute to
Style," which has raised $3 million since its inception in 1996. This
year, the event is set for Sept. 23, the day after the Emmy Awards.
It's sponsored by Jaguar and benefits the Entertainment Industry
Foundation's National Arts Education Initiative. Champa, event
co-chairwoman, is credited with bringing to the gala famous
Italians--designer Roberto Cavalli and tenor Andrea Bocelli among
them. "This one is a big fashion hound," said co-Chairwoman Susan
Dolgen, pointing to Champa. "She knows how to talk it up."</TE>
<TE>   Quote/Unquote</TE>
<TE>   "I'm angry. I'm sad. It's a very difficult and sad time.
Sometimes, you don't see things coming even though they are
happening. It was a real deep connection, a deep marriage, so it's
not that simple to say this or that one thing caused the problems.
It's clear to me that our priorities shifted overnight." --Angelina
Jolie to Us Weekly on living apart from her husband, Billy Bob
Thornton.</TE>

<HD>Jakes Fits 2 Worlds Under His Tent</HD>
<DH>Preacher takes a modern tack to spread old-time message</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>

<LD>Super-Bishop T.D. Jakes fits right in with the other gnawingly
tele-familiar faces sprinkled through the Beverly Hills Four Seasons.
In the last quiet minutes before the dinner rush, he lingers with the
rest of the semi-incognito. Undercover Brother Eddie Griffin, in a
bandanna, lounges on the terrace; Earth Wind &amp; Fire bassist Verdine
White, in a crisp cream suit and Jackie O shades, strides through the
lobby. But Jakes doesn't take note of them at all.</LD>
<LD>   He has traveled from his home in Dallas to the center of the land
of handlers and cell phones, accompanied by his own dark-suited
entourage, a busy network of mobiles set on vibrate and devoted to
"keeping Bishop on schedule."</LD>
<LD>   This stop, on the cusp of evening, is sandwiched between a morning
at the Christian Booksellers Assn. International Convention in
Anaheim and a Hollywood signing to promote his new book (the 26th!):
"God's Leading Lady: Out of the Shadows and Into the Light" (Putnam),
the latest chapter of his attempt to heal women "broken" in spirit.
He'll take his message to Hollywood in an old-style tent revival.</LD>
<TE>   Not just a super preacher in the old-fashioned sense--a man with a
big church, bigger following and lots of spin--Jakes is a
super-hyphenate, a televangelist-playwright-lyricist-life
coach-author-CEO-husband-father-etc. Modern life is complex, and
Jakes has addressed it by becoming conversant with myriad worlds and
disciplines. Being a modern minister, he explains, means "being
relevant and sensitive to the needs of the people that you are
serving. And in order to do that, you have to do more than study
Scriptures, you have to study people." He settles into a plush chair
for a quick dinner of Caesar salad and chicken. "I've just about cut
my diet down to just chicken and fish," he says, handing the waiter
the menu. "Not for religious reasons, mind you. But for dietary
reasons. Obesity reasons. I've gotta be able to fit in my suits!" He
lets out a gust of a laugh.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, Jakes is a big man with a big reach and big voice that he
plays like an instrument--he burnishes his vowels and purrs
appropriate consonants, though not in an ostentatious way. Even his
whisper has colors and texture. And a slight lisp adds softness.</TE>
<TE>   This evening, his dress is as casual as his demeanor. In an oyster
gray short-sleeved shirt and loose slacks, with matching gray
ostrich-skin open-toe sandals, Jakes seems ready for a walk along the
pier rather than a speaking engagement--and that has long been a key
aspect of the charismatic style that led Time magazine to dub him the
best preacher in America. It's an approach that's brought him steady
success. In 1996, he moved to Dallas from his native West Virginia
and founded Potter's House, his multiracial, multidenominational
dream church. In just over five years, it has expanded from a
50-family flock to a congregation of more than 28,000 named as one of
America's fastest-growing churches by Christianity Today. His live
and internationally televised appearances reach tens of thousands
each year.</TE>
<TE>   Jakes--the T.D. stands for Thomas Dexter--keeps upping the ante.
He has wired his "smart church" with Internet ports to download
sermon notes, provides an in-house service that instantaneously
translates pastor's message into one's language of choice and has
installed a microwave dish atop the church that beams Sunday sermons
to prisons in real time. Ministering to so many, Jakes has been big
on constructing crucial comfort zones for his audience. "When it
comes to spirituality--the culture of spirituality--there aren't
rights and wrongs, it's just different shades of gray."</TE>
<TE>   In his 25 years at the pulpit, he has positioned himself as a
"meet you where you are" sort. "You've got to look at the
demographics," he says, "tailor the message to the continuity of
their need. And you have to be versatile enough to deliver it in a
way that is palatable to that particular audience and not to be
one-dimensional ....When your message is not relevant, people tend to
drift away."</TE>
<TE>   Though social justice has historically been the hallmark issue of
black church leaders, Jakes argues that many other arenas demand
equal attention. "That isn't to say that the original challenges do
not exist. But there are additional issues that are so much more
relevant to what our--African American--people are facing today.
Developing family structures. Economic empowerment is a critical
issue. Redefining families from the traditional idea of the mom, the
pop, the 2.5 kids and the one-and-a-half car garage. That isn't
always our experience," explains Jakes, who lives with his wife
Serita and five children.</TE>
<TE>   "It may be two sisters who have been divorced and they've moved in
together and they have children. There may be blended families. There
are Grandmamas and Big Mamas raising children. And those are issues
in our community that we have to deal with."</TE>
<TE>   So his pastoral counseling came to include everything from credit
and loan-management counseling to male mentoring programs. "I've seen
life at its best or worst ... so you get a whole panoramic view of
the needs of people." But he has found one set of needs particularly
resonant: those of women who live in spiritual isolation. "Many of
them had deep scars and secret issues that they were unable to really
work through and generally thought that they were the only ones who
had ever gone through anything that horrendous," Jakes says. "If they
could meet each other and find out that they were not alone, that
would be a great way to minister to them. And my job as a pastor was
to provide biblical answers to sociological ills." He found his focus
with a Bible class of 40 women. "It was only supposed to be one
class. But I didn't finish, and I decided to carry it on next week,
and the women seemed to really enjoy it--and brought lots more women.
At that point, I thought: 'Let's go another week, I'm really on a
roll.' " By the end of the month, Jakes recalls, "there were women
standing outside to hear me talk about this subject that I didn't
even have a name for."</TE>
<TE>   That work morphed first into a book, "Woman Thou Art Loosed"
(Albury Publishers, 1996), which sold 2 million copies, and then into
a franchise of gospel musicals, lecture tours, CDs and more
books--"The Lady, Her Lover and Her Lord" (Putnam, 1998), "His Lady"
(Berkley Pub Group, 1999)--that aimed to help women heal emotional
wounds left by physical or emotional abuse. "I had based it on the
Gospel of St. Luke, Chapter 13, where Jesus had healed a woman who
was infirm, bent over for 18 years and could not lift up herself. And
he said to her, 'Woman, thou art loosed!' "</TE>
<TE>   Poised to offer the latest chapter of his healing saga--"God's
Leading Lady" (it appears at No. 8 on the New York Times' list of
advice bestsellers Sunday)--Jakes is quietly reflective as his limo
snakes swiftly through post-rush-hour traffic. As twilight settles,
he watches neon flicker on, the first wave of clubbers float by.</TE>
<TE>   A white tent with a simple placard announcing "Tent Revival" comes
into view. Stuck incongruously on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, the
setup looks like a prop. Smiling, checking for lettuce, he does a
last-minute scan in the mirror. "Years ago, I used to get nervous. My
hands would shake so bad I wouldn't even use a microphone. That's why
I tell people: You shouldn't let fear stop you. You don't know where
you might go."</TE>
<TE>   There is something teasing and rich about bringing the message of
"God's Leading Lady" to Hollywood. "God's leading lady does not
require play-acting or pretending .... On the contrary, becoming a
true leading lady requires stripping away all the other roles and bit
parts you may have settled for and acted out before." Jakes, in a
way, is like an agent talking up a part that is waiting for just the
right woman, a role that only she can fill when she is ready to go
for it.</TE>
<TE>   Emerging from the limo, Jakes is met by the rest of his traveling
entourage and by a few members of the Sonset Ministry, the evening's
hosts, decked out in suits and dresses. He's ushered into an
air-cooled trailer that is set up next to the tent on the corner of
Hollywood and Argyle. Jakes sips water. After casual chat, he turns
to the small assembly, and says: "Let's go in and enjoy the music."</TE>
<TE>   On stage a guitarist/singer, keyboardist and drummer work the
congregation up. They clap, stamp their feet, raise their swaying
palms. Jakes is escorted in rock-star style to a front-row folding
chair. It's humid as a Southern summer inside. Worshipers of all
races, ages and classes stand shoulder to shoulder. And there are
women. Women in skirts, twin-sets and Sunday dresses. In mumus and
African bubus. There are models and students, actors and
teachers--and even a pompadoured Elvis look-a-like has stopped in to
hear the Word.</TE>
<TE>   Pastor Scott Bauer, of the Church on the Way, introduces Jakes,
who bounds up the riser to hoots, hollers and applause. He says he's
only going to talk for 10 minutes--but his setup for the book
unscrolls into a gilded sermonette. Jakes begins pacing but not quite
prowling the stage. He's teaching, not quite preaching, but it is a
taste enough to tip the crowd into high-praise mode. "Many times you
are not ready to go ahead because you haven't dealt with where you
came from. You can dress up, paint a smile on your face and go out
into the world but still be in the depths ... be in the shadows ...
It's time to arrive and shine!"</TE>
<TE>   "Amen."</TE>
<TE>   "Jesus sat down at the well and waited. Now, I hate waiting, I'm
not a patient person. But Jesus is. And he waited. He waited for one
woman. Do you know how important you are to God? Jesus will wait for
you to catch up to your desires and your purpose. He will wait for
you to grow up and confess up."</TE>
<TE>   Oh-kaaay!</TE>
<TE>   "Don't be looking, wanting something from people that they just
don't have. Don't be waiting for people to make you happy ... to fix
us. God says, 'I have a role for you to play.' And it is unique unto
you .... Develop yourself. This is soul food. Don't enter into a
relationship thirsty."</TE>
<TE>   His words reach out like a hug. Before he is finished, a line
begins to whip around the tent's perimeter. The eager stand with
single copies open to the title page, waiting for their moment with
Bishop. There are singers and ministers, recovering addicts and
missionaries, all hoping for help on their path. Ninety minutes have
raced by. He shares prayers, stops tears, reconnects with old
friends--every one of them blessed by Jakes' open gap-toothed smile.</TE>
<TE>   Back in the limo, "Who was that Patrick Swayze look-alike?" asks
one member of the entourage. "I dunno," says Jakes sinking into the
seat. "I never know who celebrities are."</TE>
<TE>   "Tell the story about Mary J. Blige!" someone shouts out.</TE>
<TE>   "Or how about [musician] MeShell NdegeOcello ...." The pastor
blushes even in the dark. "Didn't know them. I knew Mary J. Blige's
name ... but not her face," he defends, as the long car fills up with
laughter. "Sometimes, I think that is why famous people come to me.
I'm not star-struck. I spent most of my youth in a vacuum running my
father's kidney machine. So I missed out on a lot." Nowadays, he
ministers to many athletes and singers, politicians and actors. "I
think they're just tired of being manipulated. And with me, well,
they can just work on what they need to." But he is not immune to
fame's pull. Jakes hopes to put a cap on his day by catching at least
a few notes of Patti LaBelle, who is performing at the West Angeles
Church of God in Christ. As he climbs out and into the night, to see
a leading lady in her own right, despite his long day there is a
distinct spring to his step.</TE>

<LD>The Great Red Apes</LD>
<LD>   Orangutans are large apes that live in Southeast Asia. Orangutan
means "person of the forest." Wild orangutans live deep in the rain
forests of Borneo and Sumatra and spend most of their time high in
the trees. They are very intelligent and can learn new things
quickly.</LD>
<LD>   In Borneo, researchers from the Orangutan Foundation International
have been studying both wild and ex-captive (once owned by humans)
orangutans for 30 years. Some of the scientists taught the ex-captive
orangutans sign language. The apes would ask for things such as
"food" and "hug," and even made up new signs like "groom."</LD>
<TE>   Some of the ex-captive orangutans learned other things just by
watching the scientists and OFI staff. Orangutans would "borrow"
clothes and put them on, wash their red hair with soap and then comb
it, and brush their teeth. One mother orangutan even learned how to
use a canoe. When nobody was around, she would put her baby in the
canoe and use her hands to paddle it across the river so she could
get to the fruit on the other side.</TE>
<TE>   Orangutans and their rain forest homes are now endangered. That
means they might go extinct in the wild. If that happens, the only
place where these magnificent animals would still live is in zoos.
OFI would like your help to save them. To learn more about
orangutans, OFI and what you can do to help, contact OFI in Los
Angeles at (800) ORANGUTAN or visit www.orang utan.org.</TE>

<LD>If you are one of those people whose connection with the National
Geographic ended when death came for the elderly aunt who sent you a
gift subscription every Christmas, brace yourself.</LD>
<LD>   The proper, yellow-bordered journal of the learned society founded
in 1888 "for the increase and diffusion of geographic knowledge" has
become the launching pad for one of American publishing's interesting
multimedia projects. One of the effort's surprising products is the
feature film, "K-19: The Widowmaker," which will open in more than
3,000 theaters across the country today. Co-produced by National
Geographic Films, it stars Harrison Ford as the captain of a
doomed-from-the-drawing board Soviet nuclear submarine and is based
on a television documentary the society made in 1996. Simultaneously,
the National Geographic's television division has sold a fresh
factual look at the K-19 incident to the MSNBC cable network, and the
society's publishing arm has put a film tie-in volume on bookstore
shelves.</LD>
<LD>   But the real star among the National Geographic's energetic new
projects is its National Geographic Directions, a series of "literary
travel memoirs" launched earlier this year. More than 30
authors--poets, playwrights and novelists--already have agreed to
participate in the series, which will publish six to 10 titles each
year.</LD>
<TE>   Volumes so far have included Oliver Sacks on a trip to Oaxaca,
Mexico, with fellow fern enthusiasts and W.S. Merwin's "Mays of
Ventadorn," a dazzling evocation of the Provencal troubadour
tradition. Among the forthcoming books of particular interest is
Pulitzer Prize-winning playwright David Mamet's "South of the
Northeast Kingdom," a personal reflection on the rural central
Vermont region where he has lived for the last 40 years. The text is
illustrated with the author's own affecting black-and-white
photographs.</TE>
<TE>   "Writing," Mamet says in his book, "is a magnificently solitary
occupation. One works by oneself all day long, wondering, dreaming,
supposing. All attitudes to which Vermont conduces ... and perhaps
the profound order of the environment seduces, as much as does the
solitude, to contemplation." Elizabeth Newhouse, who edits the series
for National Geographic Books, says: "We were looking for something
to do other than big illustrated travel books. Then we realized that
we had never done anything of a serious literary nature and that we
loved the format of the Penguin Lives series,"--compact biographies
by distinguished writers. "With that inspiration, we thought it would
be wonderful to get famous writers to write of the places they care
about--places they travel to, want to travel to or treasure in their
own neighborhoods."</TE>
<TE>   American travel writing never has enjoyed quite the cachet of its
British counterpart, and that neglect has obscured the fundamentally
different perspectives each brings to the genre. American travel
writers tend to make place their central preoccupation; for
historical antecedent, think Thoreau's "A Week on the Concord and
Merrimac Rivers." The central British preoccupation is the
reality--physical and existential--of travel itself; think Chaucer
and his pilgrims on the way to Canterbury. What they share is the
quality the father of English literature ascribed to his
"philosophers:"</TE>
<TE>   And gladly would he</TE>
<TE>   lerne and gladly teche.</TE>
<TE>   "One of the joys of this series for us," said National
Geographic's Newhouse, "is very much its sense of place. We also
value very highly the strong author's voice in each book. The writer
is very much a part of the narrative and, in some way, the first
subject of each book. And, of course, that means that each of these
books is and will be very different from the others." For example,
she said, "Mamet's book is a completely Mamet-like work."</TE>
<TE>   Among the other volumes New- house anticipates "are Garry Wills'
book on the University of Virginia, which was designed by Thomas
Jefferson. John Edgar Wideman has gone to Martinique. His companion
was a woman with whom he is involved, which took him in a very
personal way into an exploration of Creole culture. Louise Erdrich is
writing about the Ojibway Indians of Ontario by traveling to their
remote sacred places around the Great Lakes. Anna Quindlen is doing
literary London for us, and Jamaica Kincaid, who is one of our finest
garden writers, is going to Nepal to look at plants."</TE>
<TE>   There is even a Los Angeles book in the offing. Novelist and
short-story writer A.M. Homes--"The Safety of Objects" and the
forthcoming "Things You Should Know"--"is doing L.A. from the
perspective of the Chateau Marmont hotel," said Newhouse. "She's out
there now putting the finishing touches on it. I'm not sure what
she's going to come up with, but it will be interesting.</TE>
<TE>   Work in Progress</TE>
<TE>   Diane Leslie, a novelist and short-story writer, is author of
"Fleur de Leigh's Life of Crime":</TE>
<TE>   "I'm working on a book that is supposed to come out in April but
isn't quite done, though I think it's going to come out whether I'm
happy or not. I hate to use the word 'sequel,' so let's just say it
takes place three years after the last novel I wrote. This one is
called 'Fleur de Leigh in Exile.' It's based on the fact that when I
was 14, I was sent from Beverly Hills to the world's worst boarding
school in Tucson, Ariz.</TE>
<TE>   "At the moment, I'm trying to choose between using 'locale' or 'in
situ,' so it's a little hard to think about the book as whole. But I
think it's fair to say it deals with prejudice from several angles.
First of all, Fleur confronts anti-Semitism and then becomes involved
with Latino migrant workers against whom her fellow students are very
prejudiced. Most of the teenagers at this school are sick in one way
or another because, in those days, Tucson was supposed to be a very
healthy place.</TE>
<TE>   "I conceived this book as an escape from Hollywood, but I couldn't
get it--or them--out of my books, so Hollywood creeps back in too."</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Mr. Melton did it again. The former head of the performing arts
program at Hollywood High School wasn't even on the premises this
week when his aging ex-students--remembering all he'd ever taught
them--won multiple standing ovations at an event they dedicated to
him.</LD>
<LD>   They emoted, they projected, they hit their marks. It was high
drama, unscripted and pure. It proved what many of us have forgotten
and some of us never had the chance to learn: that one excellent
teacher can exert a lifelong, life-altering effect on many hundreds
of students' lives.</LD>
<LD>   From 1968 until 1992, Jerry D. Melton--his ex-students still call
him Mr. Melton--influenced generations of kids who somehow wandered
into his classes and found their futures there.</LD>
<TE>   Hundreds of set and lighting designers, writers, directors,
actors, hair and makeup artists--all learned the ethics and essence
of their future professions under Melton's tutelage. In plays and
musicals--from "Hello, Dolly!" to "Cabaret" and "Macbeth"--Melton
established a tradition of excellence that made Hollywood High's the
most renowned public school theater program in the country for years.
His productions swept up plenty of awards. For example, Melton and
his kids took first place 16 times out of 20 in the city's annual
Shakespeare festivals.</TE>
<TE>   Many of those Melton taught have stayed in touch with him and with
each other. Some still pay regular visits to the North Hollywood
house where Melton and his wife, Ruthe, used to hold cast parties,
pool parties, casual dinners and act as surrogate parents for those
students whose home lives were less than ideal.</TE>
<TE>   About two weeks ago, Melton was diagnosed with liver cancer, and
his condition worsened steadily. When some former students heard
about it, they hastily put together a mini-version of the major
Melton event they had planned to hold in 2003, as part of the
school's centennial celebration. Knowing that he might not survive
that long, they shaped a ceremony to show just how much he has meant
in their lives. Melton was too ill to attend.</TE>
<TE>   At the ceremony, his daughter, Mary, cut the ribbon to officially
rename the school auditorium, which will now be known as the Jerry D.
Melton Theatre.</TE>
<TE>   The former students also inaugurated two scholarships to be
awarded in his name. The Jerry D. Melton Theatre Arts Scholarships
will bestow $5,000 annually on each of two Hollywood High School
students who will be selected on the basis of talent rather than on
academic ability. That is the way he wants it, his daughter said.</TE>
<TE>   The theater was filled with a few hundred people who'd received
last-minute e-mails or phone calls informing them of the
spur-of-the-moment event. Honorary Hollywood Mayor Johnny Grant and
actors Mickey Rooney, Sally Kellerman and Martin Landau were among
those who showed up to honor the man they said they'd heard about for
years, although they'd never been students of his.</TE>
<TE>   Mostly, the audience consisted of former Melton students such as
writer-director Frank Darabont, class of '77, who went on to make
such films as "The Shawshank Redemption," "The Green Mile" and "The
Majestic." About Melton, Darabont said: "He's an unsung hero who
provided inspiration and motivation--and was a father to many of us
in many ways. It feels like I spent most of my high school time in
this auditorium. I had two classes a day here for three years. One
was stagecraft--period 5--where we would build sets, make costumes,
paint signs. Period 6 was theatrical drama class, where we would
rehearse the productions, often long into the evening."</TE>
<TE>   Darabont and others recalled that Melton would often drive them
home, take them out for a dinner break, drive them to what was then
the school district's TV station, where students could participate in
a news show that aired for half an hour once a week. "Back in the
good old days, when schools were actually funded, he made sure we got
all the experiences available to us," Darabont said. "We would write
the show, anchor it, go out and get the stories. It was another
wonderful thing Jerry Melton did."</TE>
<TE>   And it wasn't just budding actors or directors who were inspired
by Melton, he added. "Sure, there were people like the actor Laurence
Fishburne. And James Schamus, the writer-producer who went on to make
'Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon.' But there were also those who
became expert hair, makeup, set, costume and lighting designers. So
many of us went on from his classes to find our own niche. And it all
started here, with him."</TE>
<TE>   Three of the four Melton children, Greg, Kathleen and Mary, were
theater students at Hollywood High. Greg is a film production
designer; Steven is a film property master, Kathleen died at age 35
of AIDS. Daughter Mary is a senior editor at Los Angeles magazine.</TE>
<TE>   Michael Sloane, screenwriter of the Jim Carrey film "The Majestic"
and member of the close-knit group that put together Tuesday
afternoon's event, recalled that "we were all little hormonal
adolescents, with absolutely no focus or discipline," when they
happened upon Jerry Melton's class. "It was only later, when we
became adults, that we realized how much he'd taught us and how he
helped us to achieve in life."</TE>
<TE>   To this day, a group of them meets for breakfast every weekend at
a place called Highland Grounds, just about a mile from the high
school. "We hang out--we've been friends all our lives. In fact, 14
of us from Mr. Melton's class were credited members of the cast and
crew on 'The Majestic,' " Sloane says.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to Sloane, and Darabont, who directed, and Gregory
Melton (Jerry's son), who was production designer, the film's costume
designer, two hairstylists, a production executive, one actress, the
on-set decorator, the locations and assistant locations managers and
the transportation coordinator had all been in Mr. Melton's classes
between 1973 and 1979. "None of us got the job because we were
friends--it was because we were all the best at what we do."</TE>
<TE>   From a personal standpoint, Sloane says, "after my mom passed away
in 1982, Jerry and Ruthe Melton pretty much adopted me. They became
my family."</TE>
<TE>   John Grant, 42, class of '78, is a lighting designer and location
manager who said he attributes "most of what I learned, most of what
I am, to him. I still go to his house, along with other former
students. We're like a big, close-knit, extended family." Grant said
he had never in his life seen "such a heartfelt groundswell of love,
such a sense of urgency," as the one that erupted among Melton's
disciples when they heard of his illness.</TE>
<TE>   Writer-producer Schamus, class of '75, recalled that he was one of
many kids Melton used to drive home to ensure that they were safe.
"And it's important to credit him for being the independent scholar
that he is. He is an intellectual not fooled by the veneer of
academia; he respects learning for itself. A percentage of his
students had bad home situations and little academic incentive from
their families--but he taught them to understand and perform
Shakespeare with the best. He collects original and early editions of
Samuel Pepys' diaries; he's an avid collector of antiquarian books."</TE>
<TE>   Schamus, in town for work on his upcoming film "The Hulk," is now
based in New York, where he is on the faculty at the Columbia
University film program.</TE>
<TE>   Other former students of Melton's include actors Robert Carradine,
Diana Canova, Charlene Tilton and Elyssa Davalos. Melton's leading
lady for the school's 1976 production of "Hello, Dolly" was Aprile
Millo, who is now a soprano with the Metropolitan Opera in New York.</TE>
<TE>   A small group of current Hollywood High performing arts students
were in the audience. After the event, Solomon White, 18, class of
2003, said the ceremony brought him to tears. " I cried because I
never knew that one person could make so many other people happy,
that one person could give so many people so much."</TE>
<TE>   The event planners had tables of refreshments for guests to enjoy
after the event. Included were cakes decorated with what they called
Meltonisms--sayings of their former teacher, which they still quote
to each other. One cake was inscribed with a favorite: "The door to
success is labeled 'push.' "</TE>

<HD>Even If the Shoe Fits, It Might Not Be Safe to Wear While
Driving</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Dear Fashion Police: I think there is a state law that forbids
driving while wearing backless shoes. It is becoming more and more
difficult to find nice-looking summer sandals that have a back strap,
but I worry about driving in slides (I think that is what they're
called.) Friends I mention this to say if you are stopped by police,
just slip them off and they'll never know, as apparently it is legal
to drive barefoot. However, I do understand that driving in backless
shoes is probably not safe. Just wondering what your take is on this.</LD>
<LD>   --FEET FIRST</LD>
<LD>   Dear Feet: It is legal in California and every other state to
drive barefoot, according to Stephanie Faul, communications director
of the AAA Foundation for Traffic Safety in Washington, D.C.
California has no other laws regarding acceptable or unacceptable
footwear, so backless sandals are OK.</LD>
<TE>   However, that doesn't mean that driving barefoot or with sandals
is recommended. "Our officers advise wearing shoes because in the
event of a crash they can prevent further injury," said Anne Da Vigo,
a spokeswoman for the California Highway Patrol.</TE>
<TE>   We'd like to second that, having been involved in a nasty crash
that resulted in a dislocated toe, a trip to the emergency room in an
ambulance and crutches. Yes, we were driving barefoot.</TE>
<TE>   Basically this is a fashion-versus-safety question, and whenever
the two go mano a mano we always cheer on safety. Not only are there
hazards to going barefoot, but other kinds of footwear--including
high heels, wedgies and chunky clogs--can cause problems as well. You
can have on the most wondrous pair of Manolo Blahnik stilettos, but
if wearing them while driving lands you a long hospital stay, they're
hardly worth it.</TE>
<TE>   We recommend keeping a pair of driving moccasins in the car at all
times so you can slip them on if your footwear is questionable. These
shoes have a soft upper with a traditional moccasin look, but the
sole and heel have little nubs and bumps that provide good traction
while driving. They'll also save your good shoes. We found several
pairs of moccasins for men and women online at Meredith Trading Post,
ranging in price from about $40 to $65 (www.meredith tradingpost.com,
[866] 279-6010).</TE>
<TE>   Dear Fashion Police: I love to play golf, but I have a problem
with summer golf clothes. I usually wear a polo shirt tucked into
shorts, with a belt--standard golf attire. However, I am overweight
and would never dream of wearing a belted outfit otherwise. I belong
to a golf club, and a lot of the women look just as bad as I do in
the limited selection of clothes we've been able to find. I wear a
size 16-18 shorts and an extra large or 1X top. Can you recommend
some places to shop and some styles that won't look out of place on
the golf course?</TE>
<TE>   --ON A FASHIONABLE COURSE</TE>
<TE>   Dear On: You have been spending way too much time on the golf
course and not enough time shopping! There's a plethora of women's
golf wear out there in misses and plus sizes, thanks to the growing
popularity of the sport.</TE>
<TE>   There are bright, fun prints and solids in cotton and cotton
blends, along with textiles that wick perspiration away, leaving you
feeling cooler. That's the good news. The bad news is that styles
haven't changed that drastically. Companies are, for the most part,
sticking with tried-and-true polo shirts, sleeveless polos, and
pleated or flat-front shorts. However, capris are making their
presence known on the links, and we do have some resources for those.</TE>
<TE>   Lady Golf has an impressive selection of apparel--some of it high
end--on its Web site, with many items in extra large. There's an AM
Player pique sleeveless polo shirt in a multicolored Hawaiian print

<DH>James Reva's styles appeal to fashion's forgotten women</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MICHAEL QUINTANILLA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Here they sit in white plastic lawn chairs sipping Evian--women in
their 40s, 50s and 60s, immaculately coiffed, manicured and exuding
class. From across Los Angeles and Orange counties, even Las Vegas,
they have gathered in a Los Angeles backyard that needs new grass,
with trees that could use a clip job.</LD>
<LD>   But none of that matters. Their attention is riveted on models
their age who emerge from the kitchen, strolling across the yard onto
an elevated runway.</LD>
<LD>   The guests applaud, point and talk to one another about their
favorite looks in James Reva's new fall collection that the L.A.
designer says is for "the forgotten woman." She is an older, mature,
fit woman--still active, still sensuous and craving stylish clothes.
But she doesn't want to dress like a teenager or look like the
ubiquitous Twiglet models in shredded sheaths and dirt-rubbed jeans
splashed in magazines.</LD>
<TE>   Reva's clients--ladies who lunch, lawyers, estate planners,
schoolteachers, volunteer moms who fund-raise and businesswomen--say
they just want to look their age in classic, modern styles without
looking matronly--a frustrating pursuit amid the midriff-baring,
low-rise trends that flood a youth-obsessed clothing market.</TE>
<TE>   "No matter where our waistlines have gone--and believe me, they
have shifted--James knows how to design for a woman that doesn't have
the Britney Spears body," says 20-year Reva client Terre Thomas,
daughter of Danny Thomas and a fund-raiser for St. Jude Children's
Research Hospital in Memphis, Tenn. "Besides, we don't want to chase
that trend. We want to look our age, but we also want to look hip and
good and with it."</TE>
<TE>   "What older woman wants to go into a store that is a hip-hop
shop?" asks Marshal Cohen, co-president of the Port Washington,
N.Y.-based market researcher NPDFashionworld. "This is a very ignored
market" he says of the nearly 40 million women 35 and older who spend
$45 billion annually on apparel. That accounts for 51% of all women's
apparel sales in the U.S. last year compared with 14% spent by the
junior market. Yet, he says, older women these days often "feel like
their figures are not what designers and retailers care about" and
they are the ones with the real spending power. "Where do they go?"</TE>
<TE>   In L.A., on a recent Tuesday morning, it was to Reva's Fairfax
Avenue studio, a two-story home the designer converted into a
showroom and factory 10 years ago. Here the women prefer the
intimate, private setting--despite the occasional barking dog and
roaring motorcycles--that Reva's biannual backyard fashion shows
provide, a concept so retro (think Avon) that it's forward.</TE>
<TE>   Reva takes it all in, pingponging from one customer to another,
answering questions about fabric and cut, mixing and matching,
accessorizing and the oft-repeated query: "How do I look in this,
James?"</TE>
<TE>   "You know," the 62-year-old designer says, "you can tear apart a
T-shirt and sew it inside out and upside down, but that doesn't give
you a career. Listen to what women want. That's the key."</TE>
<TE>   He caters to his clients because he knows "they are money in the
bank." Indeed, Reva's personal touch, his endurance and evolution in
the cutthroat world of fashion, has served him well. While
contemporaries such as David Hayes has participated in L.A.'s fashion
week with a star-studded front row and Peter Cohen just opened a new
shop within the last year, Reva takes a different route.</TE>
<TE>   Twelve years ago he took the specialty-store concept of trunk
shows--small, exclusive showings where orders are taken on the
spot--into private homes where women can select garments in the
$200-to-$650 price range from current collections and shoes, handbags
and jewelry from local designers. He also began his backyard fashion
events.</TE>
<TE>   Today, Reva has a network of 10 commission-earning full-time
fashion directors and another 10 part-timers who bring clients to his
studio. The directors also coordinate weeklong one-on-one fittings
between customers and the designer whose Wardrobe Dressing Inc.
nearly hit $1 million in sales last year.</TE>
<TE>   Making Them Look Good</TE>
<TE>   "If anything, a woman wearing a James Reva garment will be
remembered--not forgotten," says longtime client Rita Amendola, who
owns a Santa Monica company that plans estate sales. For three
decades she and other clients have counted on him to make them look
good by hiding and highlighting their changing bodies.</TE>
<TE>   "I have big hips and small shoulders but I can still wear size 8
and can squeeze into a 6 because James knows how to conceal and bring
out the best in me. That's why we love him," Amendola says while
taking in the show of comfortable ribbed knits, sexy ruffled tops and
fluted evening skirts floating down the catwalk.</TE>
<TE>   Gael Libby, a volunteer coordinator for a domestic violence
shelter in Orange County, always jokes that there are two men in her
life: "My husband and James Reva. They both make me feel and look
fabulous." A 15-year Reva devotee, she admits, "I'm hippier now. And
I'm tall. But James always reminds me that I have a small waist. So,
for me, the cut is on the bias--fitted on the top and flared out. I
always feel I'm going to look age appropriate, elegant and feminine
in his clothes."</TE>
<TE>   Most of Reva's customers--affectionately known as "Reva's
harem"--have followed the designer since 1972 when he opened his
first boutique in Arcadia, followed by another in Pasadena,
attracting college coeds with his hip-hugger designs and other
creations. Soon came a Newport Beach boutique on Balboa Island and
then his signature, star-magnet shop in Beverly Hills, where he
created clothes for 12 years for actresses such as Rita Hayworth,
Barbra Streisand, Cher, Raquel Welch, Diana Ross, Ali MacGraw and
Jane Fonda, including the evening gown Fonda wore when she won . the
1978 Oscar for best actress.</TE>
<TE>   By then Reva had closed his earlier free-standing boutiques and in
the early 1980s shut down the Beverly Hills shop to produce his
clothes for the next several years for Neiman Marcus, Bloomingdale's,
Saks Fifth Avenue, Lord &amp; Taylor and Bergdorf Goodman as well as the
long gone Bullocks Wilshire and I. Magnin.</TE>
<TE>   In 1986, he realized that "wholesaling was eating me alive" and
began his backyard and home events.</TE>
<TE>   'Women, Not Girls'</TE>
<TE>   "I'm honest with my customers," Reva says several days later at
his studio, where he works with a full-time staff of five. "I have no
qualms about telling a woman, 'This will not look good on you.' Women
want to hear that. Not everyone is a size 0 or wants to be." And, he
says there are a lot of petite women--young and old--who don't want
to wear hip huggers, don't want their midriffs exposed. "They want to
dress like women, not girls."</TE>
<TE>   And having dressed actresses, he has seen how Hollywood is hard on
them as they age, shoving them aside for younger women regardless of
their talent. "That was one of the reasons I got out of Hollywood. I
wanted to see another side of this business. I didn't just want to
deal with some insanely egotistical person who is so insecure and
then have to deal with her business manager, her publicist, her
handlers, her handlers' handlers and her mother on top of it."</TE>
<TE>   These days Reva relishes working with women who have become more
than clients. They're his friends who accompany him to movies, the
theater, opera, museums and art galleries.</TE>
<TE>   "He's Mr. L.A.," says Thomas about Reva's love for the L.A.
lifestyle. When Jimmy, his son, died six years ago at 33 from
complications of AIDS, his customers were there for him. The divorced
Reva has an adult daughter, Jennifer, and a granddaughter. Jimmy was
an artist--and a jewelry designer--who once hand-painted designs on
silk and cotton that Reva turned into garments. He points to his
son's work that fills the studio: colorful paintings, thoughtful
messages on signs, chandeliers crafted from beads and trinkets--and
more art in an upstairs bedroom where Reva crashes on late nights
when he doesn't want to drive to his Manhattan Beach home.</TE>
<TE>   Karin Lekas, a Reva sales representative in Irvine for 16 years
remembers "the horrible loss and pain" Reva experienced. "Watching
James go through that taught us all a lesson in strength."</TE>
<TE>   Close friend and business consultant Mark E. Jarrett recalls how
Reva refused to miss a day of work after his son's death. "Part of my
deep, deep respect and love for this man is because of his work
ethic."</TE>
<TE>   "That's how Jimmy would have wanted it," Reva says. And he's happy
and proud that he, too, inspired Jimmy with his own creativity and
consistent work. "Jimmy really picked up on a lot of that--about
producing."</TE>
<TE>   He often has to steer clients away from looks they like but
shouldn't wear. Besides, he says, "I won't sell anything to people
when they're not 100% sure about it because I don't want to get it
back."</TE>
<TE>   'A Very Good Salesman'</TE>
<TE>   Good salesmanship is something Reva learned from his father,
Julius, who died at 45 from a brain hemorrhage. He owned and operated
Reva Construction in the 1950s and built homes in the San Gabriel
Valley at a time when moving to the suburbs was the thing to do.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm a very good salesman," says Reva, a Monrovia High School
graduate who at 18 was a licensed real estate agent and a full-time
student. "I would sit out there on a weekend and sell five or six
houses for $13,500, just by myself. I would promote it, advertise it,
get the signs made the way I wanted. Basically, I listened to what
the people wanted."</TE>
<TE>   During the week he attended Woodbury College, where he studied
advertising and fashion and graduated a year after his father's
death. Reva helped his mother, Nellie, now in her late 80s, operate
the construction business until all the homes were sold. For the next
year he worked in L.A.'s downtown fashion district for Vera, a scarf
company. During his lunch hour and after work he'd check out other
showrooms, talk to people and imagine himself in the business.</TE>
<TE>   "One day I went shopping," he says and with his real estate
savings and money his dad left him. "I bought a little store in
Arcadia," which his mom helped him operate. "I just knew it, knew it,
knew it--that I would get into the fashion business."</TE>
<TE>   And here he is, three decades later, still at it, pushing forward
with a Web site (www.jamesreva-online.com) and thinking about the
future that includes a possible return to manufacturing, which he
says he'll also reinvent because "what I really have is this
tremendous history of clothing at every level." And he understands
women. "I think that's why I've survived."</TE>

<LD>The next morning Annette still felt miserable. Poor little creature.
Why hadn't she been more careful? Now Nadia would be unhappy too. She
looked at the empty, unsqueaking wheel. Suddenly she got an idea.
Annette decided she must buy another mouse for Nadia. That's the
least she could do.</LD>
<LD>   "Mom," Annette called. "I want to take some of my money and buy
Nadia another mouse. Could you drive me to the pet store?"</LD>
<LD>   So her mother took her to buy another mouse. He was sparkling
white with bright red eyes, exactly like Cherry Eyes. When Annette
put him in the cage, Tyler said, "Hey, nobody could ever tell that</LD>
<TE>   isn't Cherry Eyes."</TE>
<TE>   "How can you suggest such a thing?" Annette snapped at her
brother. She had thought the same thing and didn't like the ideas it
put in her head.</TE>
<TE>   "What's the matter with you?" Tyler asked, bewildered.</TE>
<TE>   Annette was lost in thought. She couldn't lie to her friend, but
what if she didn't say anything? It would hurt Nadia terribly if she
knew the truth. Annette watched the new mouse burrow happily under
the shavings. What should she do?</TE>
<TE>   While waiting for Nadia to pick up Cherry Eyes, Annette was sad
and quiet. As soon as Nadia walked into her bedroom, Annette burst
out, "Nadia, I have to tell you. This isn't Cherry Eyes. It looks
like him, but--Sammy got him." Annette sniffed loudly as tears ran
down her face.</TE>
<TE>   "It isn't Cherry Eyes? It sure looks like him." Then Annette
noticed that Nadia was looking toward the ceiling. She was laughing.
"Then who is that?"</TE>
<TE>   Annette looked up. On the top ruffle of her curtain stood a little
white mouse with red eyes, wiggling his pink nose.</TE>
<TE>   Annette threw her arms around her friend and hugged her with joy
and relief. "It looks like I've learned a lot in the last week," she
said, "and I have a mouse now too."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Mice are interesting animals. You can learn more about them at
your local library. This story will be on The Times' Web site at www

<HD>Board Silly in the Sun</HD>
<DH>With surf wear all the rage this summer, what's the next
logical step? Learning the sport. Surf camp may bring a new wave of
fans--young girls.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CINDY CHANG</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Santa Monica Beach early Wednesday is swarming with 50 pony-tailed
girls of all shapes, sizes and ages. They await initiation rites:
assault by foaming walls of water, endless trudging in heavy surf,
repeated dunkings in cold saltwater. Their reward will be the sheer
exhilaration of standing atop a powerful wave and riding it into
shore.</LD>
<LD>   The girls--the youngest only 6, the oldest 16--are about to become
surfers.</LD>
<LD>   They begin on the sand at 9 a.m., miming the moves they will later
do in the water--paddling with their arms, then clambering to their
feet as quickly as they can. It's easy on dry stable land.</LD>
<TE>   Then it's into the cold surf to try the real thing.</TE>
<TE>   A mere two hours later, the girls emerge, boards in hand, feeling
like seasoned veterans of the waves. Almost all have experienced the
feeling that 14-year-old Regina Judson likens to "floating on thin
air, as close as we'll get to being in space."</TE>
<TE>   In between though is a frightening variety of wipeouts. The boards
fly out from underneath the girls even before they try to get to
their feet. As they shift their weight, the boards flip over onto
them. One girl hits the water, rear-end first, moments after standing
up.</TE>
<TE>   This is the rhythm of the morning: paddle out, turn around to
catch a wave, try to stand up on the board. On the sixth attempt or
thereabouts, everything might all fall into place. Mallory Lopez, a
10th-grader from Montana, finds herself standing upright for a
precious few seconds before the board slides out from under her. The
glazed grin on her face says it all.</TE>
<TE>   There's nothing much the instructors can say to ease the way.
"Paddle, paddle, paddle, arch your back, now go!" they urge, but in
the end, each girl must figure out for herself how to negotiate the
complicated act of getting to her feet while balancing on a narrow
board that's rapidly zipping toward shore. By the end of two hours,
almost all manage at least a few precarious seconds upright on their
boards.</TE>
<TE>   "It's just fun out there. With the waves, it's a different
feeling. It's more calm. You're just thinking about getting another
wave," says Amber Cannon, a sophomore at El Segundo High School, who
like most at the all-girls surf camp was a first-time surfer. They
each paid $50 for the five-hour lesson and would take home a goodie
bag filled with a T-shirt, bracelet, cosmetic case, beach towel and a
copy of Surfing Girl magazine.</TE>
<TE>   "My hope is that they'll want to keep on surfing, that they'll
stand up, get going and feel that rush.... If we can get every girl
to take home that feeling of surfing, then we've accomplished
something," says Randy Hild, a senior vice president at the clothing
company Quiksilver, which co-sponsored the surf camp with
Screenblast, a division of Sony Pictures Digital Entertainment.</TE>
<TE>   Quiksilver has been sponsoring a series of such surf camps locally
and nationally. Girls are quickly eclipsing male surfers when it
comes to sales of surf wear, but most have never ridden a wave. But
the surf-wear industry expects more interest in the sport after the
Aug. 16 debut of Universal Pictures' "Blue Crush" about female
surfers.</TE>
<TE>   Boys and girls have different learning styles, so surf camps are
often separated by sex, says event organizer Mary Setterholm, who
owns Surf Academy in Hermosa Beach. "The boys just want to get out
and charge. The girls will listen to the lecture first, so sometimes
they pick things up faster."</TE>
<TE>   Surfing teaches patience, says Danielle Gasteiger, one of the
instructors at the camp. "It takes determination to get good at it
... it's about building muscles, getting strong, getting good."</TE>
<TE>   The girls seem to pick up these lessons well. "When I wipe out, I
just think, now I can try again," says Desiree Alayon, an 11th grader
from Chula Vista.</TE>
<TE>   "I think about doing it again, better," says Mallory from Montana,
who is spending part of the summer with relatives in Los Angeles. "I
fall but then I just go right back out again."</TE>

<HD>Good-Natured 'Tadpole' Hampered by Technical Flaw</HD>
<DH>The witty coming-of-age film is marred by an uneven,
digitally shot look, a disservice to its first-rate cast.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KEVIN THOMAS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"Tadpole" plays like a witty, well-told short story, sly and
delightful. It unfolds neatly over Thanksgiving vacation for a
precocious 15-year-old, Oscar Grubman (Aaron Stanford), home from
prep school to the handsome Manhattan apartment of his father,
Stanley (John Ritter), a classics scholar who's kindly but a tad
self-absorbed, and his stunning second wife, Eve (Sigourney Weaver),
a cardiology researcher. The Grubmans and their friends are a most
urbane group with terrific taste in everything from decor to wine,
and they are articulate, civil and humorous.</LD>
<LD>   Oscar, whose mother is French and has returned to live in her
native country, is not your typical teenager. His command of his
mother's language is sure, and he is a huge admirer of Voltaire, whom
he surely read in the original. Most important, girls his age hold no
interest for him, and although virginal, he sets his sites on older
women. None is more alluring to him, alas, than his own stepmother,
who is as warm and thoughtful as she is lovely. Ironically, because
of the demands of her work and her lack of domestic skills, she
thinks she's not such a good stepmother, but of course she's a young
male's dream of a stepparent.</LD>
<TE>   Poor Oscar is churning with feelings and desires he can't express
to Eve, when circumstances throw him together with Eve's best friend,
Diane (Bebe Neuwirth), a beautiful chiropractor. Diane is a worldly
and confident woman who displays an amused, mischievous streak in
regard to Oscar.</TE>
<TE>   Director Gary Winick, who did a good job with "The Tic Code,"
which brought attention to Tourette's syndrome without being preachy,
has brought a deft touch to Heather McGowan and Niels Mueller's
sparkling script. In his first starring role, Stanford, who appeared
in Woody Allen's "Hollywood Ending" and is actually 23, holds his own
in the company of Weaver, Ritter and Neuwirth, who play with relish.</TE>
<TE>   "Tadpole" is a sophisticated, funny and good-natured treat, slight
but a pleasure. It is also a movie with a serious problem. Many
movies shot digitally are very good-looking, and the process allows
for a flexibility and modest budgeting ideal for intimate,
sophisticated fare that might not otherwise make it to the big
screen.</TE>
<TE>   All well and good, but the uneven look of "Tadpole" is a detriment
to its enjoyment, even to those willing to overlook technical
deficiencies for the sake of fine material and performances.
Sequences distractingly alternate between those in which the color is
natural and clear and those that are glary and orange/sepia-toned
with instances of obvious halation around the actors. Exterior
daylight scenes are especially poor, not to mention unflattering.
"Tadpole" and its cast warranted better.</TE>

<LD>For the last two years, Allison Janney, who plays White House
spokeswoman C.J. Craig on NBC's "The West Wing," nominated herself
for an Emmy as best supporting actress in a drama series--and won.
This year, she upped the ante, asking the Academy of Television Arts
&amp; Sciences to select her for best lead actress in a drama series.</LD>
<LD>   Ditto for Jennifer Aniston on the network's long-running comedy
"Friends."</LD>
<LD>   So, what gives? Did Janney and Aniston get bigger roles or bigger
egos?</LD>
<TE>   "It certainly can be fluid," said John Leverence, the academy's
vice president of awards. "It really depends on the performer's
perception of how they functioned, either as lead or support, in the
series during the current eligibility year."</TE>
<TE>   The academy reviews all of the entries and--although Leverence
won't name names--it has bumped actors who nominated themselves in
the lead category back down to the supporting category.</TE>
<TE>   "We have a number of entries that we felt were inappropriate, and
we changed them," he said.</TE>

<KH>All That Jazz</KH>
<HD>A Young Singer Blossoms</HD>
<DH>Lizz Wright may be a product of the hip-hop generation, but
her style surpasses eras.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DON HECKMAN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The buzz about Lizz Wright began darting around the jazz world a
couple of years ago, emanating from her home in Atlanta, where her
group, In the Spirit, was chosen the city's best jazz group in 2000.</LD>
<LD>   Wright's demo tape made its way to Ron Goldstein, chairman of the
Verve Music Group, who late last year signed her to the label. That's
not a bad place for an artist, given that the company was once home
to Ella Fitzgerald and Sarah Vaughan, and currently boasts
multimillion-seller Diana Krall.</LD>
<LD>   But Wright comes from a different generation and a different genre
than all of the above. Like Norah Jones, also an early
twentysomething, she came to maturity at a time when mainstream jazz
was primarily visiting its past and pop music was fracturing in all
directions.</LD>
<TE>   But that doesn't bother Wright at all. In L.A. for dates at the
Hollywood Bowl on Wednesday, and tonight and Saturday at California
Plaza, she speaks candidly about establishing her place in the music
scene.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm 22 and I know that I'm doing what people in my generation
consider old music," she says. "At the same time, when I bring it to
them--when I do straight-ahead stuff in clubs where all they hear is
hip-hop and soul--they love it.</TE>
<TE>   "I think what we have to do is believe that people still have an
appetite for meaning, even though they now tend to live in a manner
in which they don't feed that part of themselves.... So I don't worry
about whether I'm hip enough, whether I'm urban-sounding enough."</TE>
<TE>   But she also adds, with a sigh, that she can't escape the special
qualities of the generation into which she was born, and the
circumstances of the cultural era in which she has become a player.</TE>
<TE>   "I think our generation's calling, and our plight as well," Wright
says, "is to see what new combinations we can make out of what
already exists. And I don't think there's anything necessarily wrong
with that. For me, that has meant accepting the fact that this is
what's going on, and that whatever we come up with that is new will
actually be a combination of what has been before. So you can
definitely call us the Fusion Pack."</TE>
<TE>   That said, Wright's performance at the Bowl in Wednesday's tribute
to Billie Holiday nonetheless showcased her deep, resonant timbres on
two Holiday classics, "I Cover the Waterfront" and "Don't Explain."
Slender and dark-eyed, with a radiant sense of self-confidence, she
sings with an articulate maturity that surpasses her youth.</TE>
<TE>   Wright is featured on Joe Sample's new recording, "The Pecan
Tree," singing a pair of mainstream originals by the pianist. Her own
maiden effort, scheduled to be released early next year, will take a
considerably different tack.</TE>
<TE>   "It's very hard for me to describe what it will be in its
totality," she says. "I'll be doing several original tunes--some with
a kind of folk or a gospel feeling, some could cross over into a pop
sort of thing. There'll be a few covers--Nina Simone's 'End of the
Line' and 'Soon as I Get Home' from 'The Wiz.' I'm thinking about
doing a Sting cover because I just want the man to know that I really
like some of the things he's done in his career. I'll probably do
Chick Corea's 'Open Your Eyes You Can Fly,' and I really want to do
'Afro Blue,' though there probably won't be space to get it on the
album."</TE>
<TE>   Wright is correct about the difficulties of description; that's a
lineup of tunes that would have trouble fitting into any single
musical category. And, in one sense, it suggests a similarity with
Jones, who debuted with an enormously successful, but not
particularly jazzy, album on Blue Note--a jazz label.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, Wright recalls with a laugh the reaction she experienced
when Tommy LiPuma, Verve president and a veteran producer, first
heard her demo.</TE>
<TE>   "He listened, looked at me, and said, 'You're not a jazz singer.'
Then I started listening to my music again, and listening to what he
very explicitly described as the definition of jazz singing, and I
thought, 'You know what? He's right.' And it's a good thing."</TE>
<TE>   Of course, given Jones' success, both LiPuma and Goldstein would
be delighted if Wright's still-unrecorded debut album--which LiPuma
will produce--were to burst through the usual genre boundaries on its
way to platinum success. And Goldstein is a believer, describing
Wright as "the full package ... great voice, charismatic stage
presence, and poise way beyond her years."</TE>
<TE>   "Look," says Wright, "I know that my album is not going to be
predictable until it's recorded, and we all can say, 'Oh, OK, that's
what this is.' I also know that I'm a part of more than just a jazz
audience. I'm a part of an underground neo-soul scene that's been
taking place in the Southeast around Atlanta, where I live. I love
drum and bass, I love '70s music and I love jazz. In fact, I loved
jazz even before I knew what it was, or what the word meant, because
it was a music that excited me....For me, jazz is the music of life;
it's what's going on your life and your soul right now."</TE>
<TE>   The frequent references to soul and spirituality that pepper
Wright's conversation reflect her childhood in a religious
environment--she's the middle of three siblings in a minister's
family. Singing gospel music with her brother, sister and father,
fascinated by her mother's jazz vocalizing and attending church
services every Sunday, Wright developed a spiritual foundation that
continues to support her current secular efforts.</TE>
<TE>   "I probably would have been doing gospel music today," she says,
"if people weren't so rigid about what gospel is."But, even though
the settings may be different from what they were when I was singing
gospel in the church, I still feel I'm doing the same thing. It's
just that I've gravitated toward a larger community, and I've come to
realize that my gift is not just for church people."</TE>
<TE>   The one thing she does not care to do is frame herself in
definitions. Asked how she describes herself, she answers with a
laugh.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm going to enjoy looking at the different boxes that people
will try to put me in when the record is released. It will be amusing
because all I can ever be is myself. I understand the whole process
of marketing; I understand the value of the buzz and the vibe. But
what really matters to me is to stay in touch with the very simple,
basic belief that this is something new, because I'm new, and the way
I see the world is new."</TE>

<HD>KPWR-FM Experiences Ups, Downs</HD>
<DH>The hip-hop station moves to No. 1 in Arbitron's ratings
even though its audience has shrunk; rock favorite KROQ drops to No.
3.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE CARNEY</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>You can win for losing, according to KPWR-FM (105.9): The hip-hop
outlet flouted the saying by jumping to No. 1 in the latest ratings
despite experiencing a decline in its share of the Los Angeles radio
audience.</LD>
<LD>   Meanwhile, after a year in the top spot, alternative rocker
KROQ-FM (106.7) dropped to third, according to the figures released
this week by ratings service Arbitron chronicling the spring period
from March 28 to June 19. Adult contemporary KOST-FM (103.5) dropped
from third place in the winter ratings to fourth, while
Spanish-language KSCA-FM (101.9) leapt from fourth to second,
improving from 4% to a 4.7% share of listeners ages 12 and up.</LD>
<LD>   While competing stations have continually tinkered with their
formats, to varying success, KPWR "Power 106" is reaping the rewards
of staying consistent, said Jimmy Steal, the station's program
director and regional vice president for Emmis Communications-Los
Angeles, which also owns country station KZLA-FM (93.9).</LD>
<TE>   "I think great radio stations are like your friends. Before you
feel comfortable with them, there has to be a pretty broad base of
familiarity," Steal said. "Familiarity comes before passion."</TE>
<TE>   He said the ideal formula for any station is to have a strong
morning show, follow that up with good music throughout the day, and
promote the station so listeners are aware of what it's doing and
want to check it out. Part of the station's overall success this
quarter came from a gain by Power 106's morning host, Big Boy, who
rose from fourth to third, increasing his audience share from 4.4% to
4.7%.</TE>
<TE>   Nevertheless, comedian Steve Harvey, on KKBT-FM (100.3),
leapfrogged his competitor to once again claim the top
English-language morning show in L.A., going from fifth to second,
rising from a 4.2% share to a 5.1%.</TE>
<TE>   "We felt we were slightly off in the winter ratings, and now we're
back to where we should be," said Nancy Leichter, vice president and
general manager of urban outlet KKBT, who said a fluke in Arbitron's
use of Census data depressed the station's numbers during the last
quarter. The spring figures put Harvey where he has been almost since
he went on the air in September 2000 as the top English-language
morning show. "It's a testament to his appeal to all types of
listeners, all ages and shapes and sizes," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Harvey remains far behind the morning drive's undisputed champion,
KSCA's Renan Almendarez Coello, known as "El Cucuy."</TE>
<TE>   "Renan is the engine," said Ken Christensen, vice president and
general manager of Hispanic Broadcasting Corp.-Los Angeles, which
owns KSCA. "The show is a combination of humor, issues--he speaks to
the audience on all subject matter. It's funny, and it can be sad and
dramatic."</TE>
<TE>   Though he always remained comfortably in first place, Coello had
dipped to 6.7% from 7.5% of the audience in the winter ratings but
rebounded to 7.9% of morning listeners in the spring, far outpacing
Harvey.</TE>
<TE>   "We've always felt that Renan is one of those rare, unique,
compelling personalities. People want to hear what he has to say.
When you look at the ratings he's generating, it's just amazing,"
Christensen said.</TE>
<TE>   KSCA almost equaled its 4.8 rating of last spring, after posting
no better than a 4.2 rating in the intervening quarters. Christensen
blamed the dip on competition from regional music station KXOL-FM
(96.3), "El Sol," which he said temporarily drew listeners away, and
said the higher ratings are partly due to the availability of new
music, with many of the station's core artists such as Banda el
Recodo, Conjunto Primavera and Los Tigres del Norte having come out
with new music recently.</TE>
<TE>   "There's some pretty good regional Mexican music out there," which
has helped boost listening, he said. "The music kind of comes in
cycles--sometimes it's good, sometimes it's not so good."</TE>
<TE>   Hardest-hit in the latest ratings was KROQ, which saw its audience
share drop from 5.1% to 4.3%. The station's morning team, Kevin &amp;
Bean, experienced a similar decline from second to fifth place.</TE>
<TE>   At the time, Kevin Weatherly, KROQ's vice president of
programming, said, "We know what goes up eventually comes down, so
we're not taking anything for granted."</TE>
<TE>   Power 106 experienced only a minor decline in its audience share
from 6 a.m. to midnight but achieved first place status thanks to
KROQ's steeper drop.</TE>
<TE>   Steal acknowledged the vagaries of ratings--which Arbitron
compiles by mailing diaries to listeners--saying, "KROQ is a great
radio station. It didn't get less great in the last 90 days."</TE>
<TE>   Steal said Power 106's success is a testament to the broad
popularity and acceptance of rap music, which now appears on
soundtracks for movies, extreme sports events and commercials. For
three weeks, Nelly has led album charts; he displaced fellow rapper
Eminem.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of rock stations will play hip-hop artists, because hip-hop
is cooler than a lot of the rock that's out there now," Steal said.
"Radio stations will continue to come after us, but we really have a
pretty good relationship with our audience."</TE>
<TE>   Big Boy, for example, "is part of his audience. He was born and
raised here." And with station staff producing and mixing records for
acts such as Jay-Z and Korn, Steal said, "we help create the culture
that's reflected through the speakers."</TE>
<TE>   In the talk arena, KFI-AM (640) maintained its lead over KABC-AM
(790) with a 3.8 and 2.0 share, respectively, as both stations dipped
slightly from the winter, as did FM talk station KLSX (97.1).</TE>

<HD>If You Live in a Town Like 'Lansdown,' Move</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KEVIN CRUST</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It's one thing to possess a stylistic deadpan touch and another to be
just plain dull. "Lansdown," the feature writing and directing debut
of Tom Zuber, is the latest in a string of comedy-tinged indie films
noir dating back at least as far as the Coen brothers' 1984 "Blood
Simple."</LD>
<LD>   And though there's a thin noir line between lust and hate,
"Lansdown" delivers nothing to stir the passions of filmgoers one way
or the other.</LD>
<LD>   Paul Shields' Jake Jorgenson is a cuckolded criminal defense
attorney in the fictional New Jersey title town who decides that he
wants his wife's lover killed.</LD>
<TE>   Jake wears crisp white shirts and colorful suspenders and spends
most of the film looking alternately doleful, baleful and annoyed.</TE>
<TE>   His reaction to his wife's extracurricular activities registers at
the same level as his agitation over tardy research from the intern
in his law office.</TE>
<TE>   Lexi, Jake's trophy wife-artist played by Jennifer Carlson (who
bears a passing resemblance to Jennifer Connelly), is carrying on a
less-than-discreet affair with a young bike-riding, softball-playing
roofer (Chris Stewart).</TE>
<TE>   Lexi, it seems, is plagued by the same boredom that will soon
envelope the audience.</TE>
<TE>   Jake's former client Gustav (D.W. Warren, who gives a
semi-amusing, cockeyed John Malkovich-with-a-funny-accent
performance) has provided the photographic and audio evidence that
confirms Jake's suspicions but turns down the $20,000 offered to
carry out a hit because it would be a parole violation.</TE>
<TE>   He out-sources the job to the Caribbean-accented Gendhi (Patrick
Louis), who in turn subcontracts with a couple of dim-bulb
weightlifter-petty-thief types named Hector (Chris Baran) and Benny
(Marc Krinsky).</TE>
<TE>   Gendhi and the two doofuses go to the work site of the intended
victim but manage to botch the murder, winding up with two dead
bodies in the trunk of their car.</TE>
<TE>   Unfortunately, neither of the stiffs is the right guy.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the gunplay, the film's dramatic arc flat-lines from the
outset, with nary a surprise on the horizon.</TE>
<TE>   The stupidity of the characters is highlighted, underlined and
bold-faced for presumably comic effect but, aside from a couple of
humorous interludes--including a "Who's on Third?" routine involving
a softball team's replacement of a dead infielder on short
notice--the film has the punch of a shortstop who's not on steroids.</TE>
<TE>   Though some witty shots and setups indicate that Zuber may have
more of a future as a director of other people's material, they're
not nearly enough to overcome the sheer inertia of "Lansdown's"
script.</TE>
<TE>   Much of the banal dialogue sounds improvised, but it lacks the
spontaneity to make it interesting, and two-dimensional characters
compounded by mostly leaden performances leave us watching the
cinematic equivalent of bad community theater.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Unrated. Times guidelines: Violence, language, sex and a scene of
full-frontal male nudity limit this to adult audiences.</TE>

<CX>   Emmy nomination--The list of nighttime Emmy Award nominations in
today's Calendar contains a nominee who was subsequently
disqualified. Music direction nominee Geoffrey Alexander, for ABC's
"Dinotopia," was ruled ineligible because he conducted the score as
opposed to arranging the music. The nomination was vacated, with the
next highest vote-getters--a tie--receiving nominations. They are
John Williams, music director, "The 74th Annual Academy Awards," ABC;
and Ian Fraser, music director, "Christmas in Washington," TNT. The
change lifts TNT's total to 23 nominations.</CX>

<HD>Anarchic Radicals in Germany Reluctantly Face a New Reality</HD>
<DH>Political idealism fades as career and family beckon in the
energetic 'What to Do in Case of Fire.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KEVIN THOMAS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"What to Do in Case of Fire" strikes just the right balance between
hard questions of political idealism and rambunctious,
credibility-defying action and suspense, resulting in provocative,
energetic entertainment.</LD>
<LD>   It is a notably ambitious and zesty first major theatrical feature
for German director Gregor Schnitzler, for whom writers Stefan
Dahnert and Anne Wild have provided a witty, audacious script. It's
no wonder that Til Schweiger, Germany's top star, signed on to head a
fine ensemble cast.</LD>
<LD>   It opens in bustling, present-day Berlin, where scars of the
long-divided city are rapidly being covered by sleek new
construction. Even the faded elegance of the Kreuzberg district, home
to many young, politically radical squatters in the '80s, is falling
to the wrecking ball. (The squatters' movement was fueled by a
shortage of housing that existed despite more than 10,000 empty
buildings in West Berlin at the time.)</LD>
<TE>   Holed up in an upper floor in a remaining derelict building are
two holdouts, Tim (Schweiger) and Hotte (Martin Feifel), who remain
faithful to their anarchic ideals. Tim is doggedly loyal to the
exuberant, bearded Hotte, who uses but is not circumscribed by a
wheelchair. They have long been fixtures at street demonstrations.</TE>
<TE>   Their lives are suddenly upended. A bomb they and other members of
their radical splinter group had placed in an empty Grunewald
district mansion in 1987 explodes when a real estate agent opens its
door to show it to an undersecretary of state freshly arrived from
Bonn.</TE>
<TE>   Neither is harmed, but Manowsky (veteran Klaus Lowitsch), a tough,
shrewd police detective nearing retirement, studies the bomb
fragments and knows where to find the culprits. The bombing could
prove an excuse to drive out the remaining squatters.</TE>
<TE>   (In one of the film's telling moments, Schnitzler displays a
splendid new building in the former East Berlin's Potsdamer Platz,
letting us take pleasure in its spare, dazzling beauty and feel glad
that it is replacing one of those bleak Communist-era structures that
encircled the plaza. Then Tim reminds us that their destruction means
a substantial loss of low-cost housing.)</TE>
<TE>   Storming Tim and Hotte's quarters, the cops confiscate reels of
film, including instructions for assembling the kind of bomb that
went off in the mansion. What are Tim and Hotte to do but round up
the four other long-departed members of their group and plan a daring
break-in at the Tempelhof police station, where the incriminating
footage is being held?</TE>
<TE>   Against this plot the filmmakers present a group of
thirtysomethings inevitably taking stock of their lives as they are
persuaded, albeit with understandable reluctance, to join Tim and
Hotte in the farfetched scheme to save their own skins.</TE>
<TE>   In the more than a decade since the group scattered, Maik
(Sebastian Blomberg) has transformed himself from punk rocker to
advertising tycoon and is confronted with the possibility that one of
the films he shot with his Super 8 camera could wreck his empire.</TE>
<TE>   Nele (Nadja Uhl) has held on to her leftist idealism but is a
single mother absorbed in caring for her two infants. Terror
(Matthias Matschke) has become so far removed from his daredevil
nickname that he has become a public prosecutor with a promising
future. And then there's the beautiful Flo (Doris Schretzmayer),
Tim's great former love, reticent and wary, but clearly successful
and surely with a man in her life.</TE>
<TE>   If the four strays find themselves pondering their lost idealism,
not to mention their sense of fun and adventure, then Tim starts
wondering whether his radicalism hasn't become pointless or obsolete.
In Manowsky's view, the struggle of the '80s was between the right
and the left, but in today's reunified Germany, it's between "the
winners and the poor slobs who haven't sold out."</TE>
<TE>   The film's satirical edge, abetted by Andreas Berger's dynamic
camerawork and Stephan Zacharias and Stephan Gade's hard-driving
score, helps immensely in holding together a volatile mix of fantasy
action-suspense, trenchant political commentary and no small amount
of heart-tugging sentiment. "What to Do in Case of Fire" is
thoughtful, even stinging at times, and lots of fun.</TE>

<LD>John Frankenheimer, who died July 6 at age 72, received an Emmy
nomination Thursday for best director for HBO's "Paths to War."
Frankenheimer previously received four Emmy Awards for best director
of a movie or miniseries for 1994's "Against the Wall" (1994), "The
Burning Season" (1995), "Andersonville" (1996) and "George Wallace"
(1998). He also was nominated five times for best direction between
1955 and 1960.</LD>
<LD>   If Frankenheimer wins, he'll join a handful of posthumous
recipients. They include:</LD>
<LD>   * Raul Julia, who won the Emmy 11 months after his death in 1994,
for best performance by an actor in a movie or miniseries in
Frankenheimer's "The Burning Season."</LD>
<TE>   * Colleen Dewhurst, who died in 1991, just two days before winning
her fourth Emmy for best guest performance in a comedy series for
"Murphy Brown."</TE>
<TE>   * Marion Lorne, who played the ditsy Aunt Clara in "Bewitched,"
died in 1968, 10 days before receiving her Emmy for supporting
actress in a comedy for the sitcom.</TE>

<LD>Billie Holiday was an elusive figure. Drug use and arrests provided
an element of sensationalism to her life. A questionable depiction of
her emerged in an autobiography that she later claimed never to have
read. Her travails contributed to the rich, often mysterious
emotional layering that always was present in her music.</LD>
<LD>   But Wednesday night's "Broadway and Hollywood Salute to Billie
Holiday" at the Hollywood Bowl did little--if anything--to add any
insights, musically or personally.</LD>
<LD>   To his credit, producer Danny Kapilian tried to bring some
thematic cohesion to the evening by including readings from "Lady
Sings the Blues," the above-mentioned autobiography. But Holiday's
own assertions about the book (which is credited to her and writer
William Dufty) undercut the authenticity of the evening's effort to
present a full personal perspective.</LD>
<TE>   Fortunately, there was enough musical talent on the bill to make
for an entertaining evening--at least in the performances of those
artists with sufficient jazz credibility of their own to properly
approach songs associated with Lady Day.</TE>
<TE>   Dianne Reeves, in her first musical appearance at the Bowl since
she was appointed to the Philharmonic's newly established Creative
Chair for Jazz post, sailed smoothly through a trio of songs--"You Go
to My Head," "Detour Ahead" and "Comes Love"--thoroughly stamping
them with her own musicality, warm sound and brisk sense of swing.</TE>
<TE>   Oleta Adams, more closely associated with the urban music genre,
applied some larger-than-life touches to "Good Morning, Heartache"
and "Billie's Blues"--sometimes successfully, sometimes not. And Lou
Rawls, always a distinctive stylist, sang "All of Me," "These Foolish
Things" and "Let's Call the Whole Thing Off" in his
characteristically jaunty manner.</TE>
<TE>   Jimmy Scott's initial appearance was badly managed, however.
Asking him to sing "Strange Fruit" directly after the recorded
playing of Holiday's original version was a mistake. Who could
possibly have followed such a searing classic with their own version,
however impressive it might have been? Scott was much better in a
later set, applying his idiosyncratic style to "Pennies From Heaven"
and "They Can't Take That Away From Me."</TE>
<TE>   The real surprise of the evening was the presence of the talented,
young Atlanta-based singer Lizz Wright, making her California debut.
Understandably a bit nervous with her first number, "I Cover the
Waterfront," she followed up with a rendering of "Don't Explain" that
offered convincing evidence of her potential as a new jazz vocal
star.</TE>
<TE>   The biggest question of the evening: What were Tom Wopat and Lea
DeLaria--performers whose skills are better applied to television and
musical comedy--doing on the bill?</TE>
<TE>   Most of the musical backing for the program was provided by the
solid playing of the Terence Blanchard Quintet (with some especially
fine tenor saxophone work from Brice Winston) and a small string
section.</TE>

<LD>Drummer Barrett Martin's plaid flannel shirt was the only reminder on
stage Wednesday at the House of Blues in West Hollywood of the
Seattle grunge-rock explosion he was part of as a Screaming Trees
member. But the same sort of community spirit that forged that
early-1990s scene was evident in the Latin-jazz fusion of the Wayward
Shamans, the power pop of the Minus 5, the cinemascopic pastiches of
Tuatara and the unrefined Delta blues of CeDell Davis.</LD>
<LD>   Featuring acts on Martin's new Fast Horse record label, this is
the latest edition of a recording and touring concept inaugurated in
1997--more of a collective performing in overlapping lineups than
four truly separate acts. Joined by longtime cohorts Peter Buck of
R.E.M. and Scott McCaughey of the Young Fresh Fellows, Martin served
both as spiritual and musical anchor, barely leaving the stage for
the show's 3 1/2 hours.</LD>
<LD>   The seven-piece Wayward Shamans opened, evoking such '70s
jazz-funk acts as the Crusaders with various combinations of horns,
Fender Rhodes piano, vibraphone and Afro-Caribbean percussion.</LD>
<TE>   With sly McCaughey in front and Buck on bass, the Minus 5 bridged
the garage-rock roots currently resurgent via the Hives and White
Stripes with Beatles-derived song sophistication.</TE>
<TE>   Buck's R.E.M.-mate Mike Mills and Southern California indie-rock
veteran Ward Dotson made winning guest appearances.</TE>
<TE>   Flagship act Tuatara's new lineup (the seven Shamans plus Buck and
McCaughey) brought boosted dynamics to well-worn models, recalling
Lalo Schifrin and John Barry movie music.</TE>
<TE>   New member Sue Orfield (replacing founding saxophonist Skerik)
stood out with her forceful and imaginative tenor sax jazz runs.</TE>
<TE>   Arkansas-based Davis, who turned 75 last month, was perhaps the
ringer. But sitting in a wheelchair and playing slide on an electric
guitar with a table knife wedged into his polio-twisted hand, he
capped the night with raw, earthy spirit, complemented by the
infectious joy of the Fast Horse participants backing him.</TE>
<TE>   The only down note was that there were not many more people in the
audience than on the stage--though if that bothered the musicians,
they never let it show.</TE>

<LD>"When you are single and live in New York ..."</LD>
<LD>   The voice, the attitude, the romantic vibes that make you almost
forget the black hole of Sept. 11. It could be, it may be. It happily
is Manhattan dating maven Carrie Bradshaw, revving up anew on
Emmy-winning--and renominated--"Sex and the City" with another funny,
affectionate ode to the Big Apple of her eye.</LD>
<LD>   Even Woody Allen doesn't blow as many kisses to New York as
Carrie. She soaks up her favorite town's vapors like a sunbather at
Jones Beach in this marvelous series, whose resumption Sunday comes
appropriately just a few days after the latest Emmy nominations. "Sex
and the City" was meant to cohabitate with awards. Especially after a
sublime 2001 finale whose dreamy fondness for New York somehow
acknowledged the city's grief, even though it was made before the
terrorist attacks.</LD>
<TE>   "Sex and the City's" fifth HBO season will be its slimmest,
cleaved to eight episodes from the usual 13 to accommodate executive
producer-star Sarah Jessica Parker's pregnancy. That is nothing to
have kittens over, though. Based on Episodes 1 and 2, the series is
as plump with urbane, sneaky humor and creative juices in 2002 as in
the past, when this witty-tender hybrid delivered some of the
fullest, roundest comedy on television. That earned it an Emmy in
2001, nominations for Parker last year and again Thursday, along with
her ensemble partners, Cynthia Nixon and Kim Cattrall. The fourth
actress in the group, Kristin Davis, is just as award-ripe, as are
those who direct and write for "Sex and the City."</TE>
<TE>   Few shows have so fluidly mingled big laughs and sentiment through
the years. Belying the sound-alikes of NBC's Emmy dominant "The West
Wing," moreover, the women of "Sex and the City" have truly
distinctive voices.</TE>
<TE>   New 'dos for them this season, new men and new baby, too. It's not
Parker's Carrie but Miranda (Nixon, also pregnant in real life) who's
the new mom, her drooling Brady looking on from his baby seat Sunday
during the group's regular luncheon forum on men.</TE>
<TE>   When anatomy connoisseur Samantha (Cattrall) utters a vivid
synonym for a female body part while angrily relating the cheating
ways of her boyfriend, Richard (James Remar), there's instant panic
around the table. All eyes are swiftly on the reclining Brady, as if
Samantha's raunchspeak could destroy his infant brain through
osmosis.</TE>
<TE>   After a pause, Miranda assures her friends about their habitual
coarse schmoozing: "It's all right. Nothing has to change."</TE>
<TE>   Wrong, of course, for despite being rigidly lustful, "Sex and the
City" is precisely about change, and growth. A bit later, Brady's
nursing mommy flips out a breast in a scene featuring memorable
nipple talk, with Miranda fearing that her cherished friendships are
lapsing as her motherhood is starting.</TE>
<TE>   This worry about babydom severing her own umbilical cord to her
pals is a reminder that "Sex and the City" is less about women
needing men to complete themselves than about Carrie, Miranda,
Samantha and Charlotte (Davis) finding pleasure in being with one
another.</TE>
<TE>   And naturally, finding joy in New York, where, Carrie maintains in
her newspaper column, "the city is your date."</TE>
<TE>   It surely is Sunday when "fleet week" hits Manhattan, the women
take a stroll, and hotblooded Samantha lasers in on three naval studs
swaggering nearby like Gene Kelly, Frank Sinatra and Jules Munshin in
"On the Town."</TE>
<TE>   Samantha: "Ladies, seamen at 12 o'clock."</TE>
<TE>   Miranda: "I pray when I turn around there are sailors, because
with her you never know."</TE>
<TE>   Think about it.</TE>
<TE>   Think also about the fine script (a sort of reverse Tailhook) by
executive producer Michael Patrick King and its direction by Charles
McDougall.</TE>
<TE>   And continued meticulous casting of small parts, in this case
wonderful Lynn Cohen back as Miranda's Old World housekeeper and
Sylvia Myles, uniquely noisy as a deli eater who sprinkles lithium on
her ice cream.</TE>
<TE>   In Episode 2, written by executive producer Cindy Chupack and
directed by McDougall, Anne Meara makes her own few minutes count as
the very Catholic mother of Brady's father, Steve (David Eigenberg),
lobbying hard for a christening to stop her grandson from "burning in
hell."</TE>
<TE>   A reluctant Miranda wants a secular baptism, and there's no
full-court press from the church, which these days, godmother Carrie
notes in a sideways jab, settles "for anything it can get."</TE>
<TE>   Also here is a book deal for Carrie (who contemplates dropping her
pessimistic voice for more salable optimism) and, of course, more on
the dating scene that inevitably threads "Sex and the City."</TE>
<TE>   At some point even the best of long-running series outstay their
welcomes and become guests who refuse to push away from the dinner
table after filling their bellies. It happened to NBC's great
"Seinfeld," whose once-transcendent singles whined about their
juvenile obsessions even as the guillotine of middle age loomed
visibly above them.</TE>
<TE>   So it's more than a footnote when Carries wonders at lunch Sunday
if she and her friends will have dating dialogues even "in our 50s."
A thought to file away as "Sex and the City" picks up another
well-deserved Emmy nod.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   "Sex and the City" can be seen Sunday night at 9 on HBO. The
network has rated this week's episode TV-MA (may be unsuitable for
children under the age of 17).</TE>

<HD>'Read My Lips': Two Lives, One Tantalizing French Film</HD>
<DH>Jacques Audiard shows he's in the top ranks of France's
filmmakers with a provocative story about abuse, love and revenge.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KENNETH TURAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"Read My Lips" is a battle of wills and desires set in a thriller
context, a violent meditation on the unlikely persistence of love, an
investigation of a difficult and compelling relationship between two
abused individuals seeking revenge for the unfairness of their lives.</LD>
<LD>   That's a lot for one film, and the powerful success of "Read My
Lips" with such provocative material shows why, after only three
films, director/co-writer Jacques Audiard, though little known in
this country, belongs in the very top rank of French filmmakers.</LD>
<LD>   The son of successful screenwriter Michel Audiard, Jacques Audiard
turned to directing because he couldn't find anyone willing to handle
his scripts. His first two films, "See How They Fall" (sadly never
released in this country) and "A Self-Made Hero," are characterized
by an unusual ability to create tension within the bounds of
traditional genre plotting while focusing on mature examinations of
the complexities of human behavior.</LD>
<TE>   Above all else Audiard, who has a novelist's gift for creating
personalities, is an intensely curious investigator of psychological
states. He's fascinated with character, with who people are versus
who they imagine themselves to be in the private corners of their
minds. It's no surprise that Vincent Cassel, the male lead here, told
an interviewer that "for the first time, I had the impression of
working on a set with adults."</TE>
<TE>   Though he began as a writer (on "Lips" he collaborated with Tonino
Benacquista), Audiard's specificity about character has helped make
him an excellent director of actors. Of the three Cesars, the French
Oscars, this film captured, one was for screenplay, one for sound,
and an especially deserved one for best actress Emmanuelle Devos,
voted in over Audrey Tautou's crowd-pleasing performance in "Amelie."</TE>
<TE>   Devos plays Carla Bhem, a secretary-assistant for a Paris-based
real estate developer, a not noticeably attractive woman in her
mid-30s who reads lips (hence the title, "Sur Mes Levres," in French)
but can't hear without the help of a pair of mechanical aids.</TE>
<TE>   Harried, hassled and overworked, completely without a personal
life, Carla does all the firm's grunt work, up to and including lying
to wives, but is so habitually taken for granted that when her boss
suggests she's so stressed she might hire an assistant, Carla's first
thought is that she might be fired.</TE>
<TE>   Though you can read victimization in Carla's face, you can also
read fury. Her sharp eyes take offense easily; as someone whose life
is a struggle, she is sullen and resentful toward those who have
things easy and don't know it. Yet because she does struggle, Carla
is a character we want our heart to go out to, even as we're not sure
we can trust her with it.</TE>
<TE>   Paul Angeli (Cassel), the man an agency sends over as Carla's
assistant, is in many ways her opposite. Ten years younger, he's a
rootless, ambitionless drifter newly out of jail who's got a kind of
oily good looks but isn't very bright. Paul's so unqualified and over
his head as an office assistant he doesn't know what "outgoing mail"
means.</TE>
<TE>   But Carla hires him on the spot. She likes having someone in her
life who'll appreciate her help, and she instinctively senses a kind
of bond with Paul, the us-against-them connection of two beaten-down
people who are too wary to completely trust each other but who
finally have nowhere to turn but each other.</TE>
<TE>   Gradually, intricately, the relationship between this pair gets
more complex. Carla asks for the kind of help only Paul can provide
for a situation around the office. Then he returns the favor when he
goes to work as a bartender for nightclub owner Marchand (Olivier
Gourmet of the Dardenne brothers' "La Promesse") and starts to have
extracurricular ideas.</TE>
<TE>   While the plot twists in "Read My Lips" may be too intensely
melodramatic for some tastes, the performances of the two leads are
impeccable, just about compelling our belief. Cassel, one of the top
young French actors ("Brotherhood of the Wolf," "The Crimson Rivers"
among many others) has reined in his natural magnetism to excellent
effect, but it is Devos whose performance absolutely has us in its
power.</TE>
<TE>   Audiard is especially good at creating intimate moments for Carla,
private reveries when the fantasies about Paul she keeps in check
during business hours come out and play. An instant of her standing
nude in front of a full-length mirror wearing only one of his shirts
is a snapshot of longing impossible to forget. The linked questions
of whether Carla can and, more than that, whether Carla should get
involved with this man are ones this bravura film tantalizes us with
until the very end.</TE>

<HD>Darkly Comic Japanese Fable Celebrates Goddess-Women</HD>
<DH>Shohei Imamura tempers satire with compassion in the earthy
'Warm Water Under a Red Bridge.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KEVIN THOMAS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Japanese master Shohei Imamura's superb, darkly comic fable "Warm
Water Under a Red Bridge" develops from a friendship between a Tokyo
office worker (Koji Yakusho, of "Tampopo," "Shall We Dance?" and
Imamura's "The Eel") and an elderly man (Kazuo Kitamura) who lived in
a book-lined shanty on a riverbank.</LD>
<LD>   Yakusho's Yosuke had been resigned to a dull, routine existence
but has been laid off. Kitamura's Taro, a free-spirited intellectual
who had urged Yosuke to live life to the fullest, has just died, but
not before telling his friend that long ago he had accidentally left
a valuable gold Buddha in a flowerpot in an old house on the Noto
Peninsula.</LD>
<LD>   At loose ends and with his marriage disintegrating, Yosuke goes in
search of the small statue. Sure enough, the house by the Red Bridge
is still there, and from it emerges a pretty young woman (Misa
Shimizu), whom Yosuke follows to a nearby supermarket.</LD>
<TE>   As it happens, Shimizu's Saeko is plagued by a physical disorder
that appalls her but also incites her either to kleptomania or lust.
Once they inevitably connect, they experience volcanic sex. (Like all
Imamura films, this one is for mature audiences.)</TE>
<TE>   Imamura is a vital, fearless filmmaker who tempers bleak, often
satirical humor with compassion. His films possess an impassioned
underlying protest of society's destruction of the individual.
Sometimes his outrage--and his outrageousness--gets the better of
him, but he is invariably complex, provocative and unpredictable.</TE>
<TE>   "Warm Water Under a Red Bridge," based on a book by Yo Henmi, may
well be Imamura's funniest film; it is also one of his most
accomplished. It is the work of a mature artist who has kept his
adventurous spirit alive, which he has expressed in a complex and
risky work carried off with an effortlessness that comes only from
wisdom and experience.</TE>
<TE>   Imamura has said he is drawn to strong women. The heroine of his
"Pigs and Battleships" (1961), set near a U.S. naval base, is not
destroyed by her rape by a GI. In "Intentions of Murder" (1964), a
woman falls in love with her rapist and begins to question her duty
to her lousy husband and his feudalistic family.</TE>
<TE>   In this film, Imamura equates mankind and animals in their
struggle for survival, as he did in "The Insect Woman" (1963), in
which a simple country girl becomes a ruthless madam, ultimately
devouring herself in her dedication to mother love and sacrifice.</TE>
<TE>   In his 1983 remake of "The Ballad of Narayama" Imamura celebrates
the strength of a peasant woman who calmly accepts an ancient village
tradition in which its residents, upon reaching 70, are left to die
on a snowy mountain. These films have allowed Imamura to probe
profoundly the relationship of nature and society, to question the
status of women and to celebrate their ultimate mystery and power.</TE>
<TE>   This background informs every tantalizing frame of "Warm Water
Under a Red Bridge," at once earthy and surreal, as Saeko emerges as
a mystical goddess of nature and Yosuke settles into the community,
joining a robust crew of fishermen. Like Yosuke, we all but forget
his search for the Buddha. When he receives a signal from Saeko,
catching sunlight in a hand mirror, Yosuke comes running from the
dock, often outstripping a runner training for the Olympics in his
rush to slake Saeko's desire.</TE>
<TE>   As always, Imamura has a lot on his mind. In a black-and-white
flashback that has the feel of one of his early films, we see the
dire fate of Saeko's mother in a turbulent sequence that recalls
Imamura's arguably greatest film, "The Profound Desire of the Gods"
(1968), in which primitive beliefs collide with modern technology. Of
"Warm Water," Imamura has said that if the 21st century will be the
era of science and technology, it will also be the era of women.</TE>
<TE>   Beautiful, poetic, raw, violent, hilarious and unsetting, "Warm
Water Under a Red Bridge" has been gloriously photographed and
jauntily scored, and boasts a screen full of characters that range
from the eloquent to the crude.</TE>
<TE>   It ends on a note of the ambiguity that charges it throughout: Is
Saeko a woman who is ultimately devouring or a woman merely in need
of an understanding love or is she perhaps both--and a goddess as
well? In any event, Imamura suggests that it's worth the risk for
Yosuke to find out.</TE>

<HD>An Insider Tells Stories About 'Music Biz'</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEFF LEEDS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"Music Biz: A Musical Comedy Without the Music," hits the stage at a
curious moment--the real-life recording industry appears to be
suffering from a lack of humor and music alike, not to mention
plunging sales. But the extremely-off-Broadway production, which
fires off one-liners on its way toward showing that it's hard to know
who to trust in the rough-and-tumble of the music business, is likely
to entertain those who get the jokes.</LD>
<LD>   The radio promotion veterans and others who attended Wednesday's
premiere treated it as if they'd discovered a hit single. Record
label employees and aspiring rockers sipped champagne on a red carpet
outside the small Century City Playhouse housing the performance. One
person approached the show's creator, radio veteran Gerry Cagle, and
announced, "I want to invest!" Even the program reads like one of the
trade publications Cagle runs for Clear Channel Communications, with
ads from the major labels congratulating the auteur and promoting
their latest projects (RCA's Elvis compilation hits stores in
September!).</LD>
<TE>   "Music Biz" tells the story of various industry players struggling
to obtain an audience with the newly seated president of fictional
Legend Records. Each suitor who comes calling--an artist manager, a
radio station programmer, a charity fund-raiser, a would-be rock
star--falls prey to the whims of the new president and accompanying
executive assistant. Wednesday's audience chuckled as if they were
watching themselves in a fun-house mirror.</TE>
<TE>   Cagle's publicist is promising cameo appearances at future
performances by impresario David Geffen and artist management
powerhouse Irving Azoff. Neither showed up Wednesday, but veteran
radio promotion executive Burt Baumgartner did, drawing applause as
he casually crossed the stage, dropped a roll of cash into an
aspiring musician's guitar case and strolled past the handlers to see
the boss.</TE>
<TE>   Cagle co-wrote the play with Shannah Miller, a radio promotion
executive at Arista Records, and independent filmmaker Rick Rose.</TE>
<TE>   Like all aspiring playwrights, Cagle says he hopes to take his
work to New York.</TE>
<TE>   In this business, everybody has a dream.</TE>

<HD>Tale of 'Stuart Little' Is Better the Second Time Around</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KENNETH TURAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"Stuart Little 2" is true to its name twice over. It's a little movie
(78 minutes, including more than five minutes of credits) intended
for little people. But, more than the last time around, it has
elements that might help divert those bigger people who find
themselves unavoidably in attendance.</LD>
<LD>   For one thing, the adventures of the 3-inch mouse who walks like a
man now have more visual flair, including a particular emphasis on
flying. The use of a new piece of technology called a SpyderCam,
unleashed from a 200-ton crane placed on the roof of a New York
hotel, re-creates the feeling of birds and miniature airplanes
swooping daringly over Central Park.</LD>
<LD>   The addition of a pair of birds to "Stuart 2's" cast of characters
is also a plus. Both admirably voiced, they are Margalo (Melanie
Griffith), a flirtatious avian free spirit brought over from E.B.
White's original book, and Falcon (James Woods), a nasty predator who
warns cohorts, "Never make a friend I can eat."</LD>
<TE>   Stuart himself, voiced by the wonderful Michael J. Fox, appears to
better advantage here, and not just because he has an extremely
spiffy wardrobe (14 costume changes, all digitally tailored and
designed by Mona May).</TE>
<TE>   Though it's hard to know how seriously to take producer Douglas
Wick's assertion that this film's goal was "to give Stuart more of a
character arc" than the first picture allowed, he's sort of right.
Freed from the burden of setting up Stuart's world, this film,
written by Bruce Joel Rubin and directed once again by Rob Minkoff,
gives freer rein to Stuart's enthusiastic personality.</TE>
<TE>   A curious byproduct of this improvement is that by comparison,
"Stuart 2's" on-screen humans are even harder to take than they were
in the original. Granted that the characters of Mr. and Mrs. Little
(Hugh Laurie and Geena Davis) are so toweringly sappy there's
probably no good way to play them, there's really no excuse for them
to seem less real than a bunch of computer-generated animals.</TE>
<TE>   One of those animals, the white Persian cat Snowbell (voiced by
Nathan Lane), is almost as much of a drag as the Littles. This
animal's stand-up comic one-liners ("Look what I'm reduced to, a
Handi Wipe with hair") are probably intended as a sop to the parents
in the crowd, but the script's painful wisecracks clash with the tone
of innocence the film is mostly concerned with projecting.</TE>
<TE>   "Stuart 2's" plot has two main thrusts, the least interesting one
involving Mrs. Little's tendency to be overprotective and not allow
Stuart room to grow psychologically. Or something.</TE>
<TE>   Stuart's older brother George (the reliable Jonathan Lipnicki) is
spending more time with his friends, so Stuart feels a bit abandoned
and in need of a new pal.</TE>
<TE>   One promptly falls into his lap, or at least into the seat of his
car, when wounded bird Margalo, fetching in an Amelia Earhart-style
aviator cap, takes refuge with Stuart as she tries to escape the
attacks of Falcon.</TE>
<TE>   Stuart gets an instant crush on Margalo and asks the Littles if
she can move in (chastely, of course. What were you thinking?).
Margalo dreams of flying south, but the fact that she enjoys watching
Alfred Hitchcock's "Vertigo" should be a hint that this bird is not
all she seems.</TE>
<TE>   Like many modern children's films, "Stuart Little 2" can't decide
between teaching good values ("You're only as big as you feel") and
tossing out fake-hip jokes. Though it doesn't happen as often as it
should, this is a better film when it allows itself simply to be
sweet.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   MPAA rating: PG, for brief mild language. Times guidelines: more
tension and jeopardy than the smallest viewers might expect.</TE>

<LD>   Hollywood Dominance: An 800-Pound Gorilla?</LD>
<LD>   If it's not exactly "Yankee Go Home," it's far from a ringing
endorsement. This week, Russia and Australia displayed ambivalence
about the dominance of American movies--no matter that the U.S.
market share is declining globally.</LD>
<TE>   Meeting with culture minister Mikhail Shvydkoi on Wednesday,
Russian President Vladimir Putin expressed dismay at the spate of
big-budget Hollywood movies and the paucity of local product.</TE>
<TE>   "The number of movie theaters has increased almost two times
recently, while the proportion of Russian films in the total volume
of circulation is less than 2%," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Shvydkoi dismissed calls for quotas on the number of foreign
films, favoring a more proactive approach. The goal is to bring the
share of Russian films in circulation to at least 25% and to produce
at least 100 new Russian films a year, he said. A particular focus:
children's films--once a mainstay of the Soviet film industry. Since
state support for the arts evaporated, Russian films have been
dominated by low-budget formulaic crime thrillers</TE>
<TE>   Half a world away, members of the film industry met at Fox Studios
in Sydney Wednesday to hear the Australian Film Commission discuss
Hollywood's stampede Down Under. The U.S. cinematic invasion was
mostly good for the industry, it concluded--providing professional
exposure and experience for local crews.</TE>
<TE>   Only 10% of the 160 workers surveyed said foreign production was
damaging to the domestic film culture, which has blossomed since the
1970s. Still, chairwoman Maureen Barron warned that careful
management is needed to avoid becoming an adjunct to their American
counterparts.</TE>
<TE>   Complaints ranged from a lack of egalitarianism on the set
(arrogance, disrespect and rigid hierarchical systems) to the
treatment of local workers, who are often paid less than U.S. crews.</TE>

<TE>   THE ARTS</TE>
<TE>   House Gives NEA a Financial Boost</TE>
<TE>   The House voted Wednesday to increase funds for the National
Endowment for the Arts, the agency conservatives once tried to
eradicate on the grounds that it supported obscene or blasphemous
projects.</TE>
<TE>   A 1997 bill to eliminate all its funding failed by a single vote.</TE>
<TE>   By a count of 234-192, the House agreed to increase the agency's
budget by $10 million, to $126 million, for the fiscal year starting
Oct. 1 The same amendment to a spending bill for public lands
programs and cultural agencies boosted funds for the National
Endowment for the Humanities by $5 million, to $131 million.</TE>
<TE>   The NEA provides matching grants for arts groups and state and
local arts organizations, while the NEH supports fields such as
history, literature and philosophy.</TE>
<TE>   "We've had draconian cuts, but we've come back," Rep. Norm Dicks
(D-Wash.) said.</TE>
<TE>   Though critics acknowledge that the agency has tightened its
controls over grants in recent years, most Republicans voted against
the amendment, saying it's a mistake to put more money into the arts
when the economy is so sluggish. Other conservatives argue that it
sets a bad precedent to exceed President Bush's budget
recommendations.</TE>
<TE>   The Senate, traditionally more responsive to NEA needs, is
expected to vote for the increase. Though a decision could be made
before an early August break, national security concerns could delay
things. Even Senate and House approval is no cause for breathing
easy, insiders point out. Given the cost of the war on terrorism,
funding for all national agencies could later be reduced.</TE>

<TE>   MUSIC</TE>
<TE>   A Rolling 'Requiem' to Honor 9/11 Victims</TE>
<TE>   Thirty choirs from Europe, Asia, Central America and the U.S. have
signed up to perform Mozart's "Requiem" on Sept. 11 as part of what
organizers are calling the "Rolling Requiem"--concerts honoring
victims of the terrorist attacks. As many as 125 other choirs may
join them, according to chairwoman Madeline Johnson.</TE>
<TE>   Each performance is set to begin at 8:46 a.m. local time--the
moment when the first plane plunged into the World Trade Center. The
event would start at the international date line and move westward.
Singers in each group will wear badges bearing the name of a person
who died in the attack.</TE>
<TE>   "There was so much loss of life, property and trust," said
Johnson. "This is a counterbalance to some of that loss."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   QUICK TAKES</TE>
<TE>   Angelina Jolie has officially filed for divorce from Billy Bob
Thornton, citing irreconcilable differences, the TV show "Extra"
reported Thursday. In the court papers, she asks for her jewelry and
personal effects, her earnings since the day they separated, and sole
custody of Maddox, their adopted Cambodian son. "It's a very sad
thing," said Thornton's publicist, Arnold Robinson of Rogers and
Cowan....Susan Sarandon will join Tim Robbins in Anne Nelson's The
Guys" at the Actors' Gang in Hollywood for the July 30, 31 and Aug. 1
performances. Philip Baker Hall ("Magnolia") and Jeanne Tripplehorn
("Basic Instinct") will replace the current cast of Robbins and Helen
Hunt, Aug. 6-23....Martha Stewart, plowing ahead despite questions
over possible insider trading on Wall Street, will launch "Martha's
Favorite Books," a weekly author segment on her syndicated daytime
show, the New York Observer reports. Her weekly cooking stint on CBS'
"Early Show," has been suspended, however, following a June 25
interview in which she was questioned about her stock sale.... After
26 years, the Roy Rogers-Dale Evans Museum is saying farewell to
California, moving from Victorville to a new $3-million building in
Branson, Mo., next spring.</TE>

<HD>Their Story Didn't Die With Them</HD>
<DH>Movies* L.A. Latino film festival documentary focuses on
trade center restaurant workers killed on Sept. 11.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LORENZA MUNOZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>She begins the interview happily describing how her husband had
serenaded her at 2 that morning with his guitar. Elizabeth Rivas
continues with a strong NuYorican accent, "I saw the buildings, they
were falling down.... I said look! They are falling down! Where's
Moises? Where's Moises?" Her head finally drops, her cracking voice
betraying her pain. "He never came back. It's been three months."</LD>
<LD>   Rivas is one of several Sept. 11 widows and family members
interviewed in David Koff's documentary "Windows." The 20-minute
film, shot in December, is a tribute to the 43 workers who perished
at the World Trade Center restaurant Windows on the World on Sept.
11.</LD>
<LD>   "Windows," and more than 70 other feature films, documentaries and
shorts, will be screened at the Los Angeles Latino International Film
Festival, which begins today and continues through July 28. The sixth
annual festival, at the Egyptian Theater, will open tonight with a
period drama from Spain, "Juana La Loca."</LD>
<TE>   The documentary opens with 1998 footage of a restaurant once full
of life--as the elevator numbers blink up to the 106th floor, the
doors open to restaurant maitre d's smiling at the camera, handsome
in their gray uniforms. The camera weaves through the restaurant,
showing sous-chefs chopping parsley in the kitchen, busboys pushing
carts and waving hello.</TE>
<TE>   While most media attention was focused on the heroic efforts of
New York City firefighters and police, other blue-collar workers and
undocumented laborers who died at the World Trade Center were, for
the most part, merely footnotes in the Sept. 11 coverage. Nobody who
was at Windows on the World that morning made it out alive.</TE>
<TE>   The loss suffered by the widows and relatives of some of those
workers was compounded by their illegal immigrant status--nearly half
of the restaurant union members were not legal residents. (Proof of
citizenship or legal residency is not required to belong to the
union.) Because of their immigration status, most of the victims'
survivors are not eligible for Social Security, unemployment or
Federal Emergency Management Agency benefits. Some were afraid to ask
for help for fear of being deported. Many do not speak English and
have been unable to find employment. However, legislation passed
early this year--called the Patriot Act--included specific provisions
for undocumented immigrants who were victims of terrorist attacks to
become residents.</TE>
<TE>   Koff said he hopes the documentary, which will premiere at the
festival Saturday at 11 a.m., sheds light on the hardships faced by a
group of people below the media radar.</TE>
<TE>   "We wanted to communicate who these people were," said Koff, who
is a senior research analyst with the Hotel Employees and Restaurant
Employees union. "Immigrant workers and undocumented workers are
hidden. They live in the shadows."</TE>
<TE>   The documentary is part of a broader union push to bring the
immigration issue back to the forefront of the national agenda.
Indeed, the film serves as propaganda for the union's efforts, with
some of the widows making a public appeal for legal residency in the
United States. In the months before Sept. 11, the Bush administration
had explored the possibility of giving legal status to millions of
undocumented immigrants--mainly of Mexican heritage. After the
terrorist attack, all plans ground to a halt.</TE>
<TE>   Union leaders are now trying to revive the issue by organizing a
massive immigrants' rights march to Washington, D.C., in the spring.
In hopes of increasing public awareness, Koff has made another
documentary--on the labor movement's mobilization of Latino voters in
last year's mayoral race--and plans to make another one on the
immigrant rights rally. "Windows" will be screened for Los Angeles
elected officials Aug. 8.</TE>
<TE>   "A system that punishes people because they don't have a certain
piece of paper is unjust and intolerable," said Koff, 62.</TE>
<TE>   "Windows," which was produced by DSG Productions, cost about
$50,000 and was financed entirely with donations from nonprofit
organizations. Koff said it was difficult to convince some of the
widows, who were deeply fearful, to take part.Eventually, a few of
them decided to speak out about their husbands in the hope of helping
change federal immigration laws. One widow, Carmen Mejia, went from
living in hiding after the tragedy to becoming the keynote speaker at
the AFL-CIO's national convention in Las Vegas in December. Still,
none of the widows has applied for legal residency. However, they are
eligible to receive compensation through the Sept. 11 federal relief
fund.</TE>
<TE>   The documentary does not focus solely on the undocumented. "Miss
Lucy," ne Lucille Virgen Francis, who was a U.S. citizen, was known
to everyone at the restaurant for her ready smile and helpful advice.
Her son, Joseph Francis, also worked at the restaurant. Miss Lucy had
retired but was so bored that she asked her son to find a job for
her. He found her a place as the restaurant housekeeper--a job
essentially created for her. In the documentary, Joseph speaks about
how his mother would pass him a $50 bill or $20 bill here and there,
even though she could barely make ends meet. The pain of losing his
mother was magnified for Joseph by the tremendous guilt he felt about
finding her that job. He was not scheduled to work that morning.</TE>
<TE>   Koff, who earlier made several documentaries, including the 1976
Academy Award-nominated story of nomadic people in Iran, "People of
the Wind," said he wanted to return to film because it can be such a
powerful medium.</TE>
<TE>   "The film can be used to make real change," he said. "This film
was made specifically because the union knows that it has a
responsibility to make changes in immigration law."</TE>

<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Despite several decades of exploration and debate, the relationship
between art and technology is far from resolved. The current
exhibition at Post, titled "e-motion" and curated by Susan Joyce,
takes yet another crack at the subject. Despite its modest scope, it
manages to capture much of the excitement--and frustration--of new
media work.</LD>
<LD>   The frustration, as the show inadvertently demonstrates, often
emerges when technical complication or novelty overwhelms a work's
artistic potential.</LD>
<LD>   James Rouvelle's "Obhut" (2002) is an interactive work involving
three precarious contraptions that seem to have been pieced together
from found objects and hardware store trinkets and that function, in
a very basic sense, as robots. They jiggle, blink and beep and
purportedly use this esoteric language to communicate with one
another when they're moved around the gallery. They're charming
little creatures, but it's unclear exactly what you're supposed to do
with them, and their higher purpose is murky.</LD>
<TE>   Similarly limited are Yucef Merhi's "Poetic Word" pieces: three
small black devices that spell out invented words (democrazy,
shoppinghour, anorecstacy) when spun properly. Piecing these words
together--without looking at the show's checklist--presents an
interesting challenge to the eye. But once solved, their novelty--and
any gratification--is short-lived.</TE>
<TE>   On the exciting side are three simpler works that challenge
traditional modes of viewing without initiating undue confusion.
Among these are Kristine Marx's two eloquent video works, each of
which diffracts a single projection of a woman moving through an
empty room into a spatially puzzling ensemble of images using
strategically placed sheets of Plexiglas. Another is Kent Anderson
Butler's stunningly beautiful video "Immersion" (2001). Shown on a
flat, upturned screen on the floor of an otherwise empty room and
accompanied by vague sounds of water, the piece depicts a minimal
encounter--a man and a woman embracing in a pool of water--with a
visual lyricism that renders it unforgettable.</TE>
<TE>   At another extreme of the art-and-technology debate is the work of
Survival Research Laboratories, an organization that builds
remote-control machines solely for the purpose of pitting them
against one another in violent warfare. A performance staged on
opening night--the group's first in L.A. in many years--transformed
the street outside the gallery into a hellish battleground of fire
and noise. Its heat exudes even from the video documentation that
plays in the gallery now. This is technology animated not by
cleverness or emotion but by sheer aggression, and it reminds us that
a soulless mass of metal and circuitry can indeed be a dangerous
thing. In art as in war, we best approach it with some caution.</TE>

<TE>   Eerie Goings-On in Middle America</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Gregory Crewdson's large, lavishly staged photographs portray a
slice of suburban life gone mysteriously awry. A weird blue haze
engulfs the streets. Unearthly white lights glow in garages and tool
sheds. Strange things fall from the sky, and residents wander
zombie-like.</TE>
<TE>   It is a familiar milieu--idyllic Middle America infiltrated by the
unspeakable, whether supernatural, sexual or criminal. It's central
to TV's "The X-Files" (and that program's ancestors, "The Twilight
Zone" and "The Outer Limits"), as well as such films as "American
Beauty," "The Virgin Suicides," "Donnie Darko" and "The Dangerous
Lives of Altar Boys"--to cite only the most recent.</TE>
<TE>   It's fair to ask how much more can really be wrung from the fabric
of the middle-class suburban psyche, especially by an urbanite like
Crewdson. Judging from these pictures, the answer would be: few major
revelations but many compelling curiosities.</TE>
<TE>   A two-story pile of loose flowers sits in the middle of a quiet
residential street while inquisitive neighbors gather around. A man
abandons his car (and most of his clothes) to climb an enormous
beanstalk that's sprouted from someone's front lawn. A modern-day
Ophelia floats in a living room flooded with 2 feet of water, her
stare cold and lifeless. Another woman stands outside a pop-up camper
in her underwear, curiously peeling a skin-like substance from her
belly.</TE>
<TE>   Each of these strange scenes is an extremely elaborate production,
involving actors, soundstages, artificial lighting and many, many
props. As a result, the photographs look an awful lot like paintings.
The tone throughout is scrupulously consistent. The colors are
synthetic and painstakingly arranged. And the figures are stiff and
distant, their gestures oddly motionless.</TE>
<TE>   This extravagant process lends the work a sense of monumentality
one rarely sees in photography. Each image is a story unto itself,
magnificently composed and singularly affecting.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, however, there's something uncomfortably
oppressive about it. Just as in the movies, where the weight of a big
budget has a way of flattening a good story, Crewdson's attention to
affect leaves the work feeling rather soulless, its mysteries largely
cosmetic. For all its expensive polish, it is not a world in which
one feels inclined to linger.</TE>

<TE>   Two Exhibits Feature Sensual Materials</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Jil Weinstock and Tanja Rector employ lush, sensual materials to
stirring effect in complementary exhibitions at Frumkin Duval
Gallery.</TE>
<TE>   Weinstock's primary medium in this body of work is rubber, which
she uses to encase zippers, beads and feather boas--playful
accessories loaded with sexual innuendo. She arranges the zippers
side by side to create long, multicolored rubber rows ranging from 2
to 16 feet across. The beads and boas she compresses into flat,
square blocks, from which they exude a messy sensuality. The boas,
which swirl like trapped snakes and break through the surface of the
rubber in fluffy patches here and there, are especially fabulous.</TE>
<TE>   Rector works with paint and wax, which she applies in smooth
layers over flat panels of wood. In the past, she has employed a
similar technique to render figures and decorative motifs (her
paintings of a female body were a memorable addition to the Laguna
Art Museum's show "Representing L.A." last fall). But these consist
entirely of nonobjective shapes and swirls. It is a successful
departure. The move toward abstraction seems to have unlocked a truly
magical quality in the materials.</TE>
<TE>   The colors are smooth and creamy: coral pinks and lavenders; pale,
springtime greens and rich whites. The compositions, equally adept on
a large and small scale, are elegantly spare, with plenty of space in
which the eye can move around. The forms are delicate and float
gracefully between the layers of wax as though suspended in a
viscous, cloudy fluid. The effect is organic. Rather than abandoning
the body as a subject, Rector seems to have plunged deeper into it,
beneath the surface of the skin.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Bright Colors Reflect Summertime Fun</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The paintings of Milan-based artist Marco Casentini are as
lighthearted and cheerful as a lazy summer afternoon. Each consists
of several flat, rectangular planes of color, all vertically aligned,
that float across the canvas like sheets of paper across a still pool
of water.</TE>
<TE>   The colors are thin, mostly bright and extremely pleasant.
Casentini's intelligent layering of tones creates a sense of space
between the forms, giving the subtle impression of depth. It also
stimulates a sense of languid motion. You're inclined to believe that
the shapes stop drifting only when your gaze falls upon them, that
they will move again once you've looked away.</TE>
<TE>   The edges of each form are ruler sharp, which gives the work a
clean, crisp quality, while a slight variation in texture keeps it
from feeling plastic-like. The variation is discernable only at close
range. Some of the planes are perfectly smooth, some have vertical or
horizontal brushstrokes and some have a faintly sponged quality. This
subtle interplay of textures also contributes to the works' breezy
sense of motion.</TE>
<TE>   Behind each is a simple, genuine love of light and color that is
especially refreshing as we head into the serious heat of summer.</TE>

<HD>Its Coffin Overflows</HD>
<DH>In a 'Sopranos'-less season, the HBO drama 'Six Feet Under'
leads all TV shows with 23 nominations. New faces supplant some
perennial nominees.</DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A changing of the guard took place in nominations for the 54th annual
nighttime Emmy Awards announced Thursday, as an influx of new series
joined the party, elbowing out an older generation of stalwarts,
including "ER" and "Frasier."</LD>
<LD>   The most prominent of the newcomers is "Six Feet Under," the HBO
drama about a family of undertakers, which--with "The Sopranos"
temporarily out of the picture--eclipsed all shows with 23
nominations and figures to provide what might be called stiff
competition to NBC's two-time drama winner, "The West Wing."</LD>
<LD>   After complaints from some critics that the Emmy nominations had
become their own kind of rerun, with the same faces turning up year
after year, several newer programs broke through. The list this year
includes Fox's serialized drama "24"; CBS' "CSI: Crime Scene
Investigation," which in its second year supplanted "ER" as TV's
most-watched hour; and the HBO improvisational comedy "Curb Your
Enthusiasm," featuring "Seinfeld" co-creator Larry David.</LD>
<TE>   Almost as notable as what was nominated, however, is what wasn't,
as a number of long-running entries saw their Emmy streaks snapped.
The also-rans include "ER" and "The Practice," which had been
nominated seven and four consecutive times, respectively; "Frasier,"
after eight straight nominations and a record five outstanding comedy
trophies; and "NYPD Blue" star Dennis Franz, a four-time winner who
had also claimed eight consecutive Emmy bids before this year.</TE>
<TE>   That isn't to say well-established shows faded away entirely.
NBC's "Law &amp; Order" claimed its 11th consecutive nomination, tying
the series record shared by "Cheers" and "MASH," while a resurgent
"Friends"--after being overlooked a year ago--earned its fifth best
comedy nomination in its eight seasons, as well as lead acting bids
for Jennifer Aniston, Matt LeBlanc and Matthew Perry.</TE>
<TE>   Despite being denied another shot at best series, "Frasier" also
will have a chance to make history at this year's awards. Nominated
in nine categories, including lead actor and supporting actor, the
series has received 27 Emmys overall, trailing only "The Mary Tyler
Moore Show" and "Cheers"--which garnered 29 and 28,
respectively--among the most-honored programs.</TE>
<TE>   Changing the dynamics of this year's competition, the six
"Friends" cast members shifted strategy and opted to submit
themselves in the lead actor balloting, having previously competed in
the supporting actor fields--a decision that rests with the
performer. In similar fashion, "The West Wing's" Allison Janney
upgraded herself and was rewarded by the Emmy voters with a lead
actress nomination, after back-to-back supporting wins in the
political drama.</TE>
<TE>   Rounding out the comedy slate are "Everybody Loves Raymond"--a
four-time nominee that never has won--and two previous winners in
that category: NBC's "Will &amp; Grace" and HBO's "Sex and the City,"
which in 2001 became the first cable series to be honored as either
best comedy or drama.</TE>
<TE>   The most closely watched contest probably will be on the dramatic
side. "Six Feet Under" edged the 22 nominations amassed this year by
"The West Wing" and last year by HBO's "The Sopranos." That includes
a quartet of lead acting nods to Peter Krause, Michael C. Hall,
Frances Conroy and Rachel Griffiths--all first-time nominees.</TE>
<TE>   Created by "American Beauty" writer Alan Ball, the HBO series
clearly in part filled a void left by "The Sopranos," which wasn't a
candidate this year because its last original episode was shown on
May 20, 2001--outside the eligibility period, which covered June 1,
2001, through May 31, 2002.</TE>
<TE>   Bob Greenblatt, one of "Six Feet's" executive producers, said his
show qualified on its merits, not because of "The Sopranos' "
absence. "I like to believe that we would have been in there anyway,"
he said. In regard to the nominations in general, including the nod
to HBO's quirky "Curb Your Enthusiasm," Greenblatt added: "Everyone
says the Emmy doesn't embrace new shows and hip shows. This
[indicates] there's a new wind blowing."</TE>
<TE>   For the second straight year, HBO harvested the most nominations
of any network, surpassing runner-up NBC by virtue of its continued
domination in the made-for-TV movie and miniseries categories. The
pay channel, received by roughly a third of U.S. homes, has
aggressively used the Emmys and other award showcases as a
springboard to market itself--often to the chagrin of the broadcast
networks that televise the show.</TE>
<TE>   A senior NBC official, in fact, was heard to tersely suggest that
they should bill HBO for the free promotion after it nearly swept the
Golden Globes in January. Because of its limited reach, HBO shows
generally attract smaller audiences, with "Six Feet Under" regularly
viewed by roughly a quarter of the audience that watches the
top-rated network drama, "CSI."</TE>
<TE>   HBO again claimed four out of five nods in the movie arena and 19
more for "Band of Brothers," the epic 10-hour World War II miniseries
produced by Steven Spielberg and Tom Hanks.</TE>
<TE>   Cable network TNT's biographical "James Dean" received the last TV
movie nomination (one of 11 in all, the most in its category),
meaning the major networks were again shut out in that arena.</TE>
<TE>   Although "West Wing" has finished second in overall nominations
two years running, the show has overpowered the drama competition
since its premiere, tallying a series-record nine statuettes its
first season and equaling the previous high of eight last year.</TE>
<TE>   "The West Wing's" total this year includes seven supporting actor
or actress nominations as well as a lead actor bid for Martin Sheen,
who faces four first-time nominees. In addition to Krause and Hall,
Kiefer Sutherland was recognized for Fox's "24"--a series that barely
earned renewal for a second year--as was Michael Chiklis for his role
as a corrupt cop in "The Shield." The honor is a surprise boost for
the new show, which airs on the FX cable network and has had some
sponsors pull out due to its gritty content.</TE>
<TE>   Three-time winner Kelsey Grammer and "Raymond" namesake Ray Romano
are joined by Bernie Mac for his eponymous new Fox sitcom and the two
"Friends" stars, also first-time nominees. As it stands, every
regular "Friends" cast member except Courteney Cox Arquette now has
been nominated in either the supporting or lead category during the
show's run.</TE>
<TE>   "Judging Amy's" Amy Brenneman is the lone repeat nominee in the
lead drama actress balloting, with Janney and the "Six Feet" duo
joined by Jennifer Garner, star of ABC's new spy show "Alias." By
contrast, the comedy actress category is full of familiar faces,
including "Raymond's" Patricia Heaton, a two-time winner.</TE>
<TE>   The Emmys added insult to injury, meanwhile, for beleaguered ABC,
which after a dismal season ratings-wise was bypassed in virtually
all key series categories, the main exception being the best actress
nomination for Garner. The network's nomination total plummeted from
63 last year to 35.</TE>
<TE>   Among other notable nominations, "The Osbournes"--a smash hit by
cable standards--drew MTV's sole nomination as best nonfiction
program, one of two categories introduced last year to acknowledge
the explosion of unscripted or so-called "reality" programming in
prime time. The other, "special class program," encompasses CBS'
"Survivor," TLC's "Trading Spaces" and a trio of specials, including
a "West Wing" documentary episode interviewing real-life White House
alumni.</TE>
<TE>   Two specials related to the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, CBS'
"9/11" and HBO's "In Memoriam: New York City, 9/11/01," also earned
recognition in the nonfiction special voting. Last year's Emmys were
postponed twice in the aftermath of those events.</TE>
<TE>   Presented by the Academy of Television Arts &amp; Sciences, the awards
encompass 86 categories. Honors in 27 categories principally devoted
to programs and performers will be televised Sept. 22 from the Shrine
Auditorium on NBC. Technical awards will be handed out Sept. 14.</TE>

<TE>   - With its 11th nomination as best dramatic series, "Law &amp; Order"
ties "Cheers" and "MASH" with the most nominations in the outstanding
series category.</TE>
<TE>   - Jim Broadbent, who won the Oscar for best supporting actor this
year for "Iris," is nominated for best supporting actor in a movie or
miniseries for "The Gathering Storm."</TE>
<TE>   - "Friends" received the most nominations, 11, in its eight-year
history. Its previous high was nine nominations in 1995, its freshman
year.</TE>
<TE>   - "Frasier" has a chance to become the biggest all-time winner of
Emmys by a series. With 27 statues in hand and nine nominations this
year, it could surpass "The Mary Tyler Moore Show, which won 29 Emmys
in its seven-year run.</TE>

<LD>Four specials that grew out of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks
received multiple Emmy nominations Thursday:</LD>
<LD>   * "America: A Tribute to Heroes" received six nominations,
including best variety, music or comedy special. "America" was seen
on multiple broadcast and cable networks less than two weeks after
the attacks in New York and Washington, D.C., and featured movie,
television and recording stars, including George Clooney, Bruce
Springsteen, U2 and Julia Roberts.</LD>
<LD>   The special also served as a telethon to raise money for the
families of victims, including police officers and firefighters, who
died in the attacks.</LD>
<TE>   * VH1's "Concert for New York City" benefit was recognized in the
same best special category, as well as for art direction of a variety
or music program.</TE>
<TE>   * CBS' "9/11" and HBO's "In Memoriam: New York City, 9/11/01" both
were nominated for five Emmys, all in the same categories, including
best nonfiction special (informational). Hosted by Robert De Niro,
"9/11" was based on footage shot by two brothers from France who had
been making a documentary on a New York City Fire Department station
when the planes crashed into the World Trade Center.</TE>
<TE>   HBO's "In Memoriam" chronicled Sept. 11 through the eyes of former
New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani and his staff, and also drew on the
experiences of other New Yorkers whose video cameras captured the
events.</TE>

<HD>Likely Oscar Move Has a Ripple Effect</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBERT W. WELKOS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A likely decision by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences
to move its 2004 Oscar telecast up a month to February, vastly
shortening the Oscar campaigning season, has touched off a scramble
by other awards shows to find earlier dates as well.</LD>
<LD>   The two-year experiment shifting the ceremony and its highly rated
ABC telecast up a month has caused Hollywood's various guilds as well
as the British Academy of Academy of Film and Television Arts to
jockey their schedules, frantically call hotels and choose new dates
for their banquets much the way Hollywood studios pick release dates
for their movies.</LD>
<LD>   "You pick a date and hope nobody else will land on your date,"
said Debra Hill, co-chairman of the Producers Guild of America awards
show.</LD>
<TE>   The frenetic search for new dates and hotel banquet rooms began
after the academy's board of governors moved to explore holding the
Oscars earlier than usual and a date of Feb. 29, 2004, was selected.</TE>
<TE>   "We are planning to go ahead with the Feb. 29 date," said Bruce
Davis, the academy's executive director. The key to that decision was
whether the organization's contract with ABC and the Kodak Theatre in
Hollywood, where the show takes place, would allow for an earlier
show.</TE>
<TE>   "[ABC] made it clear that they had hoped we could move the event
well into February to have the show appear during their sweeps
period," Davis said, "but they understand an Oscar show is not a
readily portable item, and we went back to them and said the earliest
we are confident we could do it is at the very end of February." An
Academy spokesman said the date of the ceremony will be moved unless
there are last-minute objections raised at the academy board of
governors' meeting on Aug. 8.</TE>
<TE>   Moving up the Oscars is designed, in part, to shorten what has
become an overly long and sometimes nasty campaign season and also to
try to reduce the number of competing televised awards shows that
have sprung up in recent years.</TE>
<TE>   Davis agrees that shortening the Oscar season will have an impact
on many aspects of the process, such as giving Oscar voters enough
time to evaluate the movies.</TE>
<TE>   "The main problem is the December releases," Davis said.
"Historically, there have been a large number of releases with big
ambitions released in December, and if that pattern continues, the
trick will be to get a very large number of very busy filmmakers a
chance to see those films before they cast their ballots."</TE>
<TE>   For Hollywood's guilds, the timing of their awards shows is
important because not only are many of their members also academy
voters but the awards they bestow in their professions also can be
precursors to the Oscars.</TE>
<TE>   "What we've done thus far is we've booked two dates for 2004,"
said Andrew Levy, special assignments executive at the Directors
Guild of America, which holds its annual awards banquet at the
Century Plaza Hotel.</TE>
<TE>   "If [the Oscars] do end up doing the switch, we've got Feb. 7
blocked out, which is the first Saturday in February," he explained.
"If they end up not doing it, we've got our normal March 6, which is
the first Saturday in March."</TE>
<TE>   Levy said any move to shorten the Oscar campaign season could have
a major impact on how studios conduct those campaigns, including
releasing their Oscar-caliber movies around Thanksgiving instead of
Christmas to allow voters more time to see the films and sending out
DVDs and videos to voters around the times the movies are released in
theaters to ensure that they see the movies.</TE>
<TE>   "Because it's a month earlier," Levy said, "you have to be out of
the starting gate and hit the ground running all of January and
February."</TE>
<TE>   A February Oscar show could cause some headaches at the BAFTA
awards in England, which shifted their 2004 show to Sunday, Feb. 8.</TE>
<TE>   Bruce Cohen, who along with Hill oversees the Producers Guild
awards show, said the guild has chosen Sunday, Jan. 25, 2004, as the
new date for its show at the Century Plaza Hotel.</TE>
<TE>   "What traditionally happens is the Directors Guild and Screen
Actors Guild hold their awards banquets four weeks before the
Oscars," Cohen said, "and the writers and producers about five weeks
before. "</TE>
<TE>   However, Kathy Connell, who produces the Screen Actors Guild
Awards, which are televised on TNT, said earlier this week that SAG
has not yet decided on a course of action for 2004.</TE>
<TE>   The Writers Guild of America, which has held its show at the
Beverly Hilton in Beverly Hills for probably two decades, said it
will move up its event and discuss venues, but nothing is finalized
yet. It has to coordinate any move with WGA East, which has its show
in New York.</TE>
<TE>   In recent years, the Oscars have televised their gala ceremony in
late March, giving the guilds, the Golden Globes, the American Film
Institute and other awards shows time to leisurely roll out their own
banquets week after week, inviting the stars to parade up the red
carpet before paparazzi and generally build the suspense leading up
to the Academy Awards.</TE>
<TE>   Moving the dates of awards shows is not as easy as it looks. To
begin with, there aren't very many hotels in Los Angeles that can
handle more than 1,000 banquet guests. The two most often used by the
entertainment industry are the Beverly Hilton and the Century Plaza
Hotel.</TE>
<TE>   At the Beverly Hilton alone, the early part of the year is already
booked for the Golden Globes and shows honoring screenwriters,
cinematographers and art directors, not to mention performing
animals.</TE>
<TE>   "We are going to have to look at fitting them all in before Feb.
29," said Jill Cross, director of catering at the Beverly Hilton. "We
are moving up the Oscar nominees luncheon to Feb. 9, if indeed
everything changes," she said. "Obviously, we tell them we will work
it out with everybody to make it happen." She noted that the hotel
plays host to the Golden Globes, the writers guild, cinematographers
and art directors as well as the Ark Trust Genesis awards for
animals.</TE>
<TE>   Larry Dean, director of catering and convention services at the
Century Plaza, said the only problem he foresees with booking new
banquets in February 2004 is that Feb. 1 is Super Bowl Sunday, which
nobody wants to compete against. He also noted that his hotel has the
National Basketball Assn.'s annual convention coming to L.A. that
month.</TE>
<TE>   For some groups, the Oscar move has not presented a problem.</TE>
<TE>   The Hollywood Foreign Press Assn., which annually holds its Golden
Globe Awards the third Sunday in January at the Beverly Hilton,
telecast live on NBC, won't have to change its show dates. Next
year's Golden Globes are Jan. 19.</TE>
<TE>   The American Film Institute, which this year saw its AFI Awards
show telecast Jan. 5 on CBS, doesn't yet know if the show will return
next year, at least in its current form.</TE>

<HD>Plans to Redesign LAX: Architecture and Anxiety</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>If you want to peer into the future of post-Sept. 11 America, few
projects offer a better lens than the recently unveiled plan for a
$9.6-billion renovation of Los Angeles International Airport.</LD>
<LD>   Designed by Landrum &amp; Brown, a Los Angeles firm that specializes
in airport design, the plan has been touted by Mayor James K. Hahn as
a safer, more efficient transportation hub for the new century. It
would require the demolition of four terminals and the removal of all
existing parking structures. New parking and ground transportation
centers would be located two miles to the east and linked to the new
terminals via an elevated train.</LD>
<LD>   The most controversial part of the plan has been its aim to limit
the airport's capacity to 78 million passengers a year, essentially
by eliminating 11 existing gates. The move would force other regional
airports to undergo major expansions to accommodate expected growth
in air travel over the next decade.</LD>
<TE>   But the proposal's other focus is security. By stretching out the
flow of movement through the airport, it seeks to relieve congestion
and increase screening and surveillance options. Relocating parking,
city officials say, will also reduce the threat of car bombings.</TE>
<TE>   The new airport is still in the early stages of being designed,
and it has yet to attain approval from the Airport Commission, City
Council and the Federal Aviation Administration. It would be financed
through a combination of increased landing fees for airlines, federal
transportation funds, local bonds and a $1.50 surcharge on passenger
tickets. If approved, planners expect to finish the master plan by
December, with groundbreaking scheduled for 2004 and completion in
2012.</TE>
<TE>   The plan is not without merit. In its desire to link the airport
to a broader transportation network, it reflects the region's
sprawling character. And its emphasis on security in the wake of
Sept. 11 is understandable.</TE>
<TE>   Yet the plan also signals a significant shift in how we view the
public realm. It sacrifices freedom of mobility for the illusion of
invulnerability and the demands of continual surveillance. As such,
it represents a new architecture of fear.</TE>
<TE>   Completed in 1961, the structures that make up LAX do not rise to
the level of great architecture. Nonetheless, their layout is a model
of efficiency and a celebration of L.A.'s car-culture ethos.
Dominated by a horseshoe-shaped roadway, the airport terminals wrap
around a series of central, multilevel, concrete parking structures.</TE>
<TE>   The layout allows passengers to sweep right up to the terminals in
their cars. And although the airport is functioning at 50% over
intended capacity, it retains the charm of its subtropical, suburban
context. It can still be a short, pleasant walk from parking to the
terminals, even if once inside the spaces are cramped and mundane.</TE>
<TE>   The new design would radically reconfigure that experience. Most
travelers would leave their cars at one of the two off-site entry
points--essentially parking structures. From there, they would board
an elevated train to one of four new terminals that would replace
existing parking and then cross the ring road on enclosed bridges to
the gates.</TE>
<TE>   The result would transform the airport into a sequence of closely
monitored checkpoints. The parking areas, for example, would focus on
screening cars for bombs and "passive security," such as using
surveillance cameras to spot known terrorists. "Active security"--bag
screening, metal detectors and explosive detection--would take place
at the main, centralized terminals. Additional screening would occur
at the gates.</TE>
<TE>   On a more practical level, the plan calls for the demolition of
many of the existing gate concourses and several terminals to make
room for safer and more efficient runway layout. The remaining
terminals would be converted into gate areas, and a new concourse
would be built behind the current Bradley terminal, at the base of
the horseshoe.</TE>
<TE>   Hahn's desire to limit the airport's capacity may be politically
untenable. The mayor has no control over other airports in the
region, and the agencies that run them have made clear that they have
no intention of changing the laws that limit their current capacity.
As recently as March, Orange County voters quashed a proposal to
build a new airport at the former El Toro Marine base.</TE>
<TE>   But from the point of view of planning, Hahn's notion of
conceiving the airport as part of a broader, regional network strikes
the right chord. The image of a decentralized city as an antidote to
the congested metropolis has been a staple of Modernist planning
strategies since the late 1920s, when Russian avant-garde architects
Moisei Ginsburg and Mikhail Barshch proposed the first "Disurbanist"
city, a grid of communal nodes that relegates the dense medieval city
to oblivion.</TE>
<TE>   No city has embodied that image more forcefully than Los Angeles.
As early as the mid-1920s, even before Ginsburg and Barshch were
indulging in their utopian fantasies, L.A.'s civic leaders were
abandoning downtown in favor of a less centralized model of
commercial and residential enclaves.</TE>
<TE>   Wittingly or not, the Hahn airport plan is a logical outgrowth of
that history. In the right hands, as the design is developed further,
it could be envisioned as part of a more fluid regional
transportation system, one of a series of portals to the sprawling
megalopolis.</TE>
<TE>   As architecture, the plan is less clear. Although Landrum &amp; Brown
will complete the master plan, architects for the specific structures
have not yet been chosen.</TE>
<TE>   Most recent airports, meanwhile, lack any real architectural
stature. Inside, they are often labyrinthine, spiritless spaces that
represent the worst of modern culture. Increasingly, these spaces
have been stuffed with concession stands, transforming them into
cluttered malls. Hahn's team says the new terminals would be equal in
size to two Universal CityWalks, a particularly queasy-making image
of the relentless march of commercialization.</TE>
<TE>   Other models exist. Nearly a century ago, structures such as New
York's original Pennsylvania Station (demolished in 1963) served as
stunning monuments to an industrialized world on the move: Cavernous
halls acted as great social mixing chambers, a kind of physical
celebration of social fluidity.</TE>
<TE>   In the past decade or so, architects such as Renzo Piano, Santiago
Calatrava and Norman Foster have designed airports that rival
turn-of-the-century monuments in their technological splendor and
overall grandeur. These are heroic structures that elevate the image
of mobility to an art form.</TE>
<TE>   At LAX, concentrating the terminals into a compact zone would
allow for the creation of a bold architectural statement. Stripped of
the crassest commercial motives, and with an enlightened view of
their potential symbolic function, they could end up being a high
point of the design.</TE>
<TE>   The plan's handling of security, on the other hand, is more
unsettling, veering away from idealism toward paranoia. The emphasis
on crowds and cars runs counter to once-accepted wisdom. In the past,
it has been airplanes, not airports, that have been the terrorist's
focal point. The slaying of two passengers by an attacker on July 4
at LAX could have happened in any large public gathering place.
Following this logic, we will soon be redesigning Disneyland and
Staples Center as well.</TE>
<TE>   What the plan sacrifices, meanwhile, is the long-standing vision
of transportation centers as gateways to a democratic culture. By
stretching out the airport experience over two miles of checkpoints
and transfer stops, the plan deals a severe blow to the freedom of
movement that is such a fundamental aspect of our society.</TE>
<TE>   Switching back and forth from cars to trains will add time to the
traveling process, and meeting people at the airport would be a
particular ordeal. Many of the conveniences we associate with
LAX--being picked up or dropped off right outside the terminals, for
example--would be impossible.</TE>
<TE>   The social and psychological implications of such changes should
not be taken lightly. The security-seasoned Israeli government, for
example, has been embroiled in a debate over whether to allow
bomb-sniffing dogs in its airports. Despite the obvious security
benefits, Israelis have so far resisted the move because the dogs are
reminiscent of those used by Nazi soldiers. Similarly, Americans have
traditionally resisted allowing armed military personnel in public
places, something that has been a familiar sight at European airports
since the 1970s.</TE>
<TE>   We are no longer such innocents. We increasingly live in a world
where the abnormal is normal, where a multitude of discomforts--and
even constriction of our civil liberties--seem suddenly tolerable.
But the reconfiguration of LAX is a long-term proposition. With 10
years of planned construction, and a multibillion-dollar price tag,
it assumes that such painful changes in attitude are here to stay. We
should assure ourselves that the trade-offs embodied in Hahn's plan
are the best and most efficient way to achieve the right measure of
security.</TE>

<HD>A 'Dream,' Long Deferred, Gets Interrupted This Midsummer</HD>
<DH>Dance* Mauro Bigonzetti worked toward the perfect moment
for his first narrative ballet, only to have a pop music album
undercut his plans.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRIS PASLES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Training his dancers carefully, Aterballetto choreographer Mauro
Bigonzetti waited three years before he felt they were ready for his
first full-length narrative ballet, "A Midsummer Night's Dream."</LD>
<LD>   "Once I had taken the direction of the company," Bigonzetti
recounted by e-mail recently from the company offices in Italy, "I
thought it was better to focus on first creating a style, starting
from pure dance energy. Then I found it was time to approach this
'Dream' I had in my mind."</LD>
<LD>   Aterballetto will dance the first United States performances of
"Dream," set to a commissioned score by Elvis Costello, today and
Saturday at the Orange County Performing Arts Center.</LD>
<TE>   There were supposed to be more performances. A four-day run at
UCLA was canceled, however, and the company's original three-day
engagement in Orange County has been cut to two.</TE>
<TE>   UCLA had planned the ballet as part of a Costello residency that
was supposed to have extended into the summer. "Unfortunately, his
plans changed," said David Sefton, UCLA performing arts director.</TE>
<TE>   "His new album ['When I Was Cruel'] exploded and it occupied all
of his life. Things he intended to do he ended up postponing, which
left Aterballetto hanging on its own. Nothing had sold on them, to be
honest. It's not a known name; it wasn't part of our dance series;
and it's high summer. We didn't want it to play to empty houses."</TE>
<TE>   Ticket sales in Orange County were so slow "it just made sense to
condense the run into two performances instead of three," said Judith
O'Dea Morr, the performing arts center's vice president of
programming.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a brand-new company to the West Coast. No one here has had
an opportunity to see them yet. They need a chance to see the them."</TE>
<TE>   Yet local audiences have seen Bigonzetti's work danced by other
companies. Balletto di Toscana danced his "Mediterranea" in Orange
County in 1998. Lewis Segal, Times dance critic, called it "a vision
of dance theater with deeper values than merely displaying steps,
styles, stars or stories." Stuttgart Ballet danced his "Kazimir's
Colors" in Orange County in 2000. Segal called it a "zesty tribute to
Russian artist Kazimir Malevich."</TE>
<TE>   There's every reason to believe that the combination of this
company and Bigonzetti will work just as well. He got his start as a
choreographer while he was a dancer with Aterballetto (the troupe's
name reflects its origins in the Associazione Teatri Emilia-Romagna
or Assn. of the Theaters of the Emilia-Romagna region).</TE>
<TE>   He performed with the troupe from 1982 until 1993, then worked
with Italy's Balletto di Toscana until he returned to Aterballetto as
artistic director in 1997. His "Midsummer's Night Dream" received its
world premiere--and decent notices--at the Bologna 2000 Cultural
Festival."For me, Shakespeare's 'Dream' is one of the most visionary
plays ever written," Bigonzetti says. "It's a world swirling with
intrigues, strange surroundings and interwoven story lines that end
up bewildering even the most attentive reader."</TE>
<TE>   In fact, he says, "the biggest difficulty was to bring on stage
three stories that go on in the same time, but each using a different
expressivity and gestural language."</TE>
<TE>   The characters--the fairies, the nobles and the actors (think
Bottom) in the play within the play--represent "three different
levels of reality," Bigonzetti says, "three worlds that I have
decided to specify with different costumes, choreographic languages,
settings. But at the end, all of them represent a different
expression of the same hidden driving force: desire."</TE>
<TE>   Although he knows the Frederick Ashton and George Balanchine
ballets based on the play, Bigonzetti regards his as quite different.
"Their versions are more classical--in the costumes, narration and
duration, too," he said. "They were created in other periods and
reflect the ideas of their time. My idea was to create something with
a lighter and softer mood, that could be also amusing and easy to
follow."</TE>
<TE>   A fan of Costello's "The Juliet Letters," a 1992 collaboration
with the Brodsky Quartet, Bigonzetti asked the Dublin-based pop star
to try his hand at writing a ballet score for a full orchestra.</TE>
<TE>   "He said, 'OK, I'll try. But I'm not sure if I can.' After I heard
three or four minutes of his music, I understood, yes, it's possible.
He had a fantastic sense about the characters and the story."</TE>
<TE>   Costello, in Australia on a world tour promoting his latest
record, admitted by e-mail that he had not had much interest in dance
until he saw an Aterballetto performance of Bigonzetti's "Paradiso,"
based on Dante's "Divine Comedy." It was "impressive and inspiring"
enough to persuade him to take the commission. And he found that
Shakespeare gave him plenty of familiar material to work with.</TE>
<TE>   "This ballet contains many fundamental elements of human
existence: desire, transformation and the humor to withstand it,"
Costello says. "Most music-making shares just a few themes. Most
songs are 'I want something' or 'I want someone,' 'I lost someone' or
'I believe in something.' I hope and believe that this piece of music
contains elements of this longing and a degree of humor."</TE>
<TE>   Working from written descriptions of each part of the dance,
Costello wrote most of the piece "straight out of my head into full
orchestral score with a pencil."He's pleased with the result, and
Deutsche Grammophon will release a revised version of the score next
year, partly reorchestrated and recomposed, played by the London
Symphony led by Michael Tilson Thomas. Still, Costello doesn't have
high expectations about the response from critics or even his usual
fans.</TE>
<TE>   "The critical debate often seems numbingly predictable," said
Costello. "The argument runs: Popular musicians crave the validation
of art music for self-aggrandizement or because they aren't having
any hits. This trivializes a serious point and is so far behind the
actual experience of musicians. I need no additional help in being
taken too seriously; I've never had any 'hits.'</TE>
<TE>   "I do these things out of love of music, curiosity and because I
can. People may recognize my voice or fingerprints in this unexpected
context, but it is not essential that they do so. It is enough for me
to have imagined something outside the confines of my own
performance."</TE>
<TE>   Both composer and choreographer would like further collaborations.</TE>
<TE>   "I hope we shall work together again," said Costello.</TE>
<TE>   "We were looking forward to both of us doing things at the same
time at UCLA," said Bigonzetti. "That was the point. But we will try
at another time."</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Thursday's news that HBO's "Six Feet Under" earned 23 Emmy
nominations, more than any other show, was enough to wake the dead.
The cable network's Sunday night original series about a Southern
California undertaker family has been widely cheered by critics who
revel in its complexity and unapologetic darkness.</LD>
<LD>   The show was created by Alan Ball, who won an Oscar in 2001 for
his "American Beauty" screenplay. This is its second season, but only
the first year it was eligible for Emmy nominations. The show became
a media sensation this year and was embraced with almost a cult-like
fever by a growing legion of fans.</LD>

Margaret, who nurtures his profound Oedipal complex; and Margaret's

<LD>Self-proclaimed storyteller Vicki Juditz is a diffident woman with a
girlish voice and understated manner. She spends the bulk of "Where
Do Babies Come From?"--her solo show at the Elephant Theater--seated
in a chair, facing the audience, her hands clasped in her lap.</LD>
<LD>   For Juditz, less is more. Under the direction of Alan
Kirschenbaum, Juditz is a study in stage minimalism, letting words
work for her, without flash or artifice.</LD>
<LD>   Juditz, whose acclaimed one-woman show "Teshuvah, Return" dealt
with her conversion to Judaism, returns to a wrenchingly personal
topic in "Babies," her account of her journey to motherhood via a
surrogate. Kirschen- baum, a veteran television producer and Juditz's
real-life husband, shared that momentous and painful progression.</LD>
<TE>   A deceptively prim figure in Naturalizers and calf-length floral
dress, Juditz launches into her candid and often hilarious
reminiscence with little ado. At age 38, after two miscarriages,
Juditz learns that she is suffering from a rare congenital deformity
that makes it impossible for her to bear children--a devastating
disclosure that leaves her reeling. In the aftermath of her
diagnosis, Juditz attends her high school class' 20th reunion,
volunteers in an inner-city children's shelter, and fields
insensitive inquiries from family members. Eventually, she and
Kirschenbaum enlist the perky Megan (not her real name), a married
mother of two, to bear their biological child.</TE>
<TE>   At first, Juditz is leery of this "stranger" who will be her DNA
vessel. But as Megan weathers crisis after crisis, Juditz is
increasingly struck by the courage of this selfless ally, who
repeatedly risks her own life to bear Juditz's daughter. Once or
twice, Juditz overstates her story, as when she lingers suspensefully
over a graphic account of Megan's C-section. But whereas other
autobiographical solo artists might have slipped into narcissism,
Juditz brings wider scope to her subject, a tale told with humor and
humanity.</TE>

<LD>With "Jesus Is Magic," concluding at Second City Studio Theatre on
Thursday, the reports of irony's death prove premature.
Writer-comedian Sarah Silverman's show is savagely effective, as
ruthlessly provocative as anything since the heyday of Lenny Bruce.</LD>
<LD>   Certainly the cramped ambience suggests the Greenwich Village of
the 1960s, buzzing with hipsters on their way to becoming notable. In
fact, "hip," along with "happy," are recurring catchwords,
established by the deadpan band--the Sarah Silvermans--in their
opening set.</LD>
<LD>   This heralds their namesake, a Generation-X conflation of Dorothy
Parker, Parker Posey and Natalie Wood's Marjorie Morningstar. She
begins pushing buttons immediately, ingenuously remarking, "I was
raped to that song," while hilariously shooing the musicians away.</LD>
<TE>   What follows is scabrously funny, Voltaire-level satire in
stand-up guise, grounded by Silverman's central tenet: Mankind's only
remaining means by which to conquer fear is ridicule. No taboo topic
escapes her, from her interfaith relationship (supplying the show's
title), through her gasp-inducing analogy concerning the way 9/11 has
conjoined the mundane to the monumental, to the riotous finale, a
rendition of "You Are My Sunshine" that must be seen to be
disbelieved.</TE>
<TE>   Such trenchant fearlessness, along with Silverman's mastery of
calculated spontaneity, may well galvanize Manhattan, where "Jesus Is
Magic" opens at the Culture Project next month.</TE>

<HD>Shakespeare Moves to the Roaring '20s</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Philip Brandes</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>By setting "Much Ado About Nothing" in the Roaring '20s, director
Allan Hunt ensures a high romp factor in this summer's comedy from
the outdoor Kingsmen Shakespeare Festival. With period theatrics
ranging from Charleston-inspired choreography to a Keystone
Kops-style chase sequence, the production finds fresh ways to amplify
the slapstick elements in Shakespeare's familiar classic.</LD>
<LD>   The conceit's most significant contribution, however, is in the
more subtle and sobering historical backdrop suggested by the World
War I-era uniforms worn by the victorious Don Pedro and his military
entourage. It is no minor skirmish from which the soldiers are
returning, but a convulsive conflict whose aftermath elevates the
ensuing frivolity into a much-needed antidote for troubled times, not
unlike our own.</LD>
<LD>   Reverberations from the Great War ground and deepen some of the
play's less frequently explored lines, such as young Claudio's (Sean
Harkinson) musings on how differently he viewed the fair Hero
(Kristin Osman) when going off to war versus the more appreciative
way he sees her now on his return. In both his infatuation and
misguided condemnation of Hero, Harkinson brings a depth of feeling
often missing in a character too easily dismissed as a callow,
lovesick youth--this sharply focused performance is one of the show's
high points.</LD>
<TE>   Doug Broyles as Hero's aggrieved father and Marc Silver as the
malaprop-slinging constable too "cunning to be understood" supply
particularly solid turns that overcome some stiffness in the
supporting roles, such as Derek Medina's disappointingly flat Don
Pedro.</TE>
<TE>   The acid test of any "Much Ado" production, however, remains its
sparring Benedick and Beatrice, whose enmity is transformed into
romance through the machinations of their friends. Here, Brett
Elliott's dashing Benedick is the picture-perfect embodiment of a
cynical confirmed bachelor who finds himself in the throes of all he
has previously jeered--and embraces it with cheery abandon.</TE>
<TE>   Envisioning Beatrice (JJ Rod- gers) as a free-spirited flapper is
more problematic--it clashes with her incisively acerbic dialogue,
more suggestive of Dorothy Parker than Zelda Fitzgerald. The
dissonance fades once the plot gets underway, as the chemistry
between Rodgers and Elliott fuels Shakespeare's wry observations
about the extent to which we deduce our own feelings from the
information we glean from others.</TE>
<TE>   Though budget necessities have forced the Kingsmen Festival to
begin charging a nominal $5 admission for adults (premium seating is
also available), it's still one of the best theater deals around.</TE>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The toll of celebrity upon the sensitive psyche forms the crux of "My
Name Is Winona and I'm a Shoplifter," playing Mondays at the Zephyr
Theatre. Michael Kearns' latest fantasia takes Winona Ryder, nee
Winona Laura Horowitz, through a stream-of-consciousness examination
of her unconventional life and career.</LD>
<LD>   Using the church setting for current Zephyr offering "Southern
Baptist Sissies," Kearns places "Noni" (Rex Lee) in a 12-step
meeting. We first encounter her offstage, spewing profanities and the
Serenity Prayer. Then, laden with shopping bags, most prominently
from Saks Fifth Avenue, she enters and begins sharing her
considerable baggage.</LD>
<LD>   Kearns posits that Ryder's troubles mirror the culture's, drawing
corollaries as far afield as Ryder's real-life godfather Timothy
Leary to the murder of Polly Klaas. This tabloid-style introspection
is most effective when skewering Hollywood hypocrisy, with the
fascinating recurring cell phone conversations and tickling sendups
of David Letterman's Top 10 lists.</LD>
<TE>   Lee, resembling Margaret Cho as a Beverly Center matron, is low on
technique and his slender vocal range only intermittently registers.
The piece is likewise inconclusive, failing to reach the attempted
merge of sympathy and satire.  Kearns' skill at lacerating comment
notwithstanding, "Winona" is a promising work-in-progress that needs
to keep working the steps.</TE>

<HD>Mon Dieu, 'Girls Can't Swim' Puts Bleak Spin on Growing Up</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KEVIN THOMAS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Anne-Sophie Birot's "Girls Can't Swim" is a typically observant,
carefully nuanced and intimate French coming-of-age film that is an
encouraging debut feature but has a needlessly downbeat ending that
is too heavy for all that has preceded it and may strike American
viewers as simply an overdose of French fatalism.</LD>
<LD>   The film is intensely French, which means it is no big deal that a
15-year-old girl is already sexually experienced and openly smokes
and drinks. This does not mean she is a mature adult, which is
Birot's point. Gwen (Isild Le Besco) is a healthy, exuberant teen who
lives with her attractive and loving parents, Celine (Pascale
Bussieres) and Alain (Pascal Elso), in a pleasant old house in a
resort town along the coast of Brittany.</LD>
<LD>   It is the beginning of July, and Gwen is looking forward to
spending the summer in the company of Lise (Karen Alyx), whose family
customarily rents a cottage nearby. But this is not just the summer
when the girls will be exploring their blossoming sexual allure, but
the one in which everything changes and nothing will ever be the
same.</LD>
<TE>   To begin with, Alain, who just manages to make ends meet as a
fisherman, is hit with disaster when the engine on the old boat he
inherited from his father plays out, and he can't afford to replace
it. This turn of events places a perfectly natural strain on family
life, which Gwen, in her youthful self-absorption, resents.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, in a city some distance away, Lise's mother (Marie
Riviere) and two older sisters are hit with tragic news of their own.
With the family vacation canceled, Lise takes off to Gwen's home on
her own. Unexpected events start exploding like the firecrackers
Alain sets off in anticipation of Bastille Day.</TE>
<TE>   What concerns Birot is what has concerned countless French
filmmakers before her: the plight of those who follow their hearts
without comprehending the full power of emotions and their potential
consequences. Birot is an engaging storyteller who can inspire
luminous, spontaneous portrayals, but her ending is so drastic that
it feels unearned, a note of bleakness struck merely for its own
sake.</TE>

<HD>7 Months in the Life of a 'Firehouse'</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOSH FRIEDMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>If your gut response to the idea of another tribute to firefighters
is a slightly guilty "Enough already," you can relax. The five-part
series "Firehouse" (starting tonight at 9 on NBC) treats its subjects
not as simple star-spangled heroes but as something more compelling:
dedicated men and women doing a dangerous job.</LD>
<LD>   The "Dateline" production profiles a different fire company each
week, beginning with Rescue 4 in Queens, N.Y. It was shot over seven
months last year using hand-held cameras to catch the action up
close, and narrated through interviews with the firefighters.</LD>
<LD>   On Father's Day 2001, Rescue 4 sped to a hardware store blaze,
where a fireball fueled by chemicals ended up killing three squad
members.</LD>
<TE>   "How much worse could it get?" one of the firefighters asked
rhetorically, and then came Sept. 11. Rescue 4 lost several of its
own in the attacks, and for months the company searched for remains
amid burning metal and concrete dust at "The Pile," or ground zero.</TE>
<TE>   The show also captures the cooped-up camaraderie of the workaday
life in a firehouse. Said one macho firefighter: "Sometimes I feel
like I'm married to some of these guys, and that's not a pretty
thought either." The gang got a grudging laugh out of the thrifty
captain, a hoarder of cleaning supplies, by secretly strewing his
scouring pads about the station.</TE>
<TE>   Though their celebrity status has been elevated post-9/11, these
firefighters seem as unassuming as they are proud of their work.
After the squad overcame a language barrier to find and save a man
trapped at an illegal construction site one afternoon, a firefighter
said simply: "It was a win."</TE>
<TE>   As another remarked without a trace of false modesty, taking the
firefighter's oath is the only act of bravery, adding, "After that,
we're just doing our job."</TE>

<HD>They've Got That Sinking Feeling</HD>
<DH>The compelling story in 'K-19: The Widowmaker' is watered
down by conventional thinking.</DH>

<LD>It's not that Hollywood doesn't know a good story when it sees one,
it's that it doesn't trust that others will be equally discerning.
For proof of that movie business theorem, look no further than "K-19:
The Widowmaker."</LD>
<LD>   No, the system hasn't completely wrecked this "inspired by actual
events" story of undersea heroism in the face of near nuclear
catastrophe. The tale is too potent, and the talents involved, from
stars Harrison Ford and Liam Neeson to director Kathryn Bigelow, are
too strong for that.</LD>
<LD>   Rather it's that "K-19's" determination to push hard for
self-congratulatory morals and convenient resolutions undercut the
film's strengths and make it more conventional. Compared to the gold
standard of submarine dramas, the crackling German "Das Boot,"
"K-19's" self-consciousness stands out in unfortunate relief,
especially because the potential for something better is definitely
there.</LD>
<TE>   "K-19's" story of the unthinkable nearly happening on Russian
nuclear submarine K-19 in 1961 is chilling enough that the Soviet
Union kept it a state secret for nearly 30 years. The cooling system
on the ship's nuclear reactor malfunctioned, causing the core to
ominously heat up. Unless the process could be reversed, a disastrous
thermonuclear explosion would result, and, given the state of
U.S.-USSR tensions at the time, that would probably trigger a world
war.</TE>
<TE>   Bigelow, one of the top action directors of her generation, has
been trying to get this story filmed since 1996. It's been a while
since the director of 1987's "Near Dark" has had something on
American screens, and you can feel the pleasure she takes in moving
cameras and men through the constricted spaces of a Soviet submarine
re-created with so much authenticity you can almost smell the borscht
in the galley.</TE>
<TE>   As written by Christopher Kyle from a story by Louis Nowra, "K-19"
opens with Mikhail Polenin (Neeson) as the captain of the brand-new
submarine, the pride of the Soviet navy and capable, like America's
Polaris, of firing nuclear-tipped missiles. As a commanding officer
he's the caring father type, determined to put the welfare of his men
ahead of the dictates of the state and party. And, almost alone in
this picture, he has the nerve to speak without a Slavic inflection.</TE>
<TE>   The Soviet hierarchy, however, in the interest of establishing
mutually assured destruction with the U.S., needs the K-19 to go on
its maiden test voyage before Polenin thinks it's ready. When your
boat's in trouble, you need a captain willing to speak with a Russian
accent, and that would be Alexei Vostrikov.</TE>
<TE>   As played by Ford, Vostrikov is a somber martinet who last smiled
at the liberation of Stalingrad. With Polenin still on board but
demoted to executive officer, Vostrikov is determined to get the
sub's missile test done on time.</TE>
<TE>   Never mind that the men think the boat is cursed because the
champagne bottle didn't break at the christening, never mind that the
ship's doctor gets seasick and their reactor officer (Peter
Sarsgaard) is brand-new, never mind that so many men have died before
this mission that the men nickname the boat "the widowmaker." "We
deliver," the new captain tells Polenin, "or we drown."</TE>
<TE>   Vostrikov, ever the demanding type, turns out to be a bear for
drills, putting his men through more turmoil than a fraternity
pledge-master during Hell Week. This leads to some high-decibel
conflicts with predecessor Polenin as the two men engage in a Harvard
Business School colloquium about leadership styles.</TE>
<TE>   Is the captain recklessly endangering the men as well as scaring
the heck out of them, or is he building their self-confidence by
setting high standards? Vostrikov may seem like one dour dude, but
with Ford in the role, there's a limit to how badly we can think of
him.</TE>
<TE>   Pleasantly old-fashioned for the most part, "K-19" frankly spends
more time than is necessary on these preliminaries. It becomes
another, better movie when the nuclear crisis begins; scenes of the
men risking horrific radiation sickness as they attempt to fix the
problem generate a grim kind of power.</TE>
<TE>   But, unwilling to let the audience draw the appropriate
conclusions about these men's heroism, "K-19" throws in signpost
dialogue, artificial plot complications and melodramatic character
changes that cheapen rather than enhance the drama.</TE>
<TE>   Interestingly enough, at least according to the History Channel,
some of the still-living real-life K-19 survivors felt an early draft
of the script portrayed them as "incompetent and undisciplined
drunks." As a finished film, however, "K-19" has the opposite
problem. It celebrates heroism with such a zeal for conventional
emotional closure it might as well have been made under the old
Soviet system that created K-19's problems in the first place.</TE>

<LD>Emmy nomination--The list of nighttime Emmy Award nominations in
today's Calendar contains a nominee who was subsequently
disqualified. Music direction nominee Geoffrey Alexander, for ABC's
"Dinotopia," was ruled ineligible because he conducted the score as
opposed to arranging the music. The nomination was vacated, with the
next highest vote-getters--a tie--receiving nominations. They are
John Williams, music director, "The 74th Annual Academy Awards," ABC;
and Ian Fraser, music director, "Christmas in Washington," TNT. The
change lifts TNT's total to 23 nominations.</LD>

<HD>Adelphia Owes Rebates, City Says</HD>
<DH>Cable: Delgadillo says customers in L.A. should be
reimbursed for incomplete upgrades.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Adelphia Communications Corp. should provide rebates to its cable
customers to compensate them for past incomplete upgrades, the Los
Angeles city attorney's office said Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   City Atty. Rocky Delgadillo, who has in the past threatened to
seek revocation of Adelphia's franchises in Los Angeles and has even
suggested the city might seize the company's systems here, will hold
a news conference today to propose the rebates, his office said.</LD>
<LD>   The statement said Delgadillo would also call for free cable for
customers, though it did not elaborate on that point.</LD>
<TE>   Adelphia's franchise agreements with the city expire Aug. 2,
though Delgadillo has said he expects those agreements to be
temporarily renewed. The company, the nation's sixth-largest cable
operator, filed for bankruptcy protection in late June following
months of disclosures of off-balance sheet loans to its founding
Rigas family, as well as overstated earnings and criminal and
regulatory probes into its accounting practices.</TE>
<TE>   Adelphia missed its quarterly franchise fee payment to the city,
equal to 5% of its local revenue, that was due June 30. The company
has until July 31 to make the payment or be held in default.</TE>
<TE>   Coudersport, Pa.-based Adelphia said earlier this month that
because of its bankruptcy filing it would reconsider an earlier move
to put its Southern California assets up for sale.</TE>
<TE>   Those assets, which represented almost half of the company's
subscribers, attracted a number of expressions of interest, the
company has said, but no formal bids.</TE>
<TE>   Separately Thursday, Adelphia Business Solutions Inc. said its
audit committee had asked outside counsel to conduct an independent
investigation into related-party transactions and agreements between
the company, the Rigas family and its former parent Adelphia
Communications.</TE>

<HD>Airline Losses Set to Bring Industry's Worst 2nd Quarter</HD>
<DH>Travel: Southwest again bucks trend with profit, but
analysts expect others to produce up to $1.4 billion in red ink.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Two of the nation's largest airlines posted a combined $279 million
in quarterly losses Thursday, as sluggish air traffic led the
industry toward what is expected to be its worst second quarter in
history.</LD>
<LD>   Low-cost carrier Southwest Airlines Co., the only major U.S.
airline to report a profit each quarter since the Sept. 11 attacks,
once again proved to be the sector's anomaly as it posted a
$102-million profit, or 13 cents a share.</LD>
<LD>   Losses recorded by other major U.S. airlines narrowed in the
second quarter, one period after the eight largest carriers racked up
deficits of more than $2.4 billion.</LD>
<TE>   But analysts still expect as much as $1.4 billion in red ink from
the industry this earnings period, and the money-losing airlines that
issued outlooks Thursday revealed no clear picture of when they might
return to profitability.</TE>
<TE>   "I think we're seeing confirmation that the revenue recovery,
which was going along at a nice clip in the fourth quarter and the
first quarter, has ground to a halt, and at the moment there's no
light at the end of the tunnel," said Salomon Smith Barney analyst
Brian Harris.</TE>
<TE>   Based on the losses reported this week, U.S. air carriers could
easily double the $890 million in losses they reported a year ago,
said David Swierenga, chief economist for the Air Transport Assn., an
industry trade group.</TE>
<TE>   Second quarters are usually airlines' strongest, as summer leisure
travel swings into play.</TE>
<TE>   The nation's airline industry has reported an operating loss in
the second quarter only three times in the last three decades,
Swierenga said.</TE>
<TE>   Delta Air Lines Inc., the third-biggest U.S. carrier, said
Thursday that its second-quarter loss more than doubled to $186
million, or $1.54 a share. Delta posted the industry's second-largest
quarterly deficit this earnings season, following AMR Corp. unit
American Airlines' loss of nearly half a billion dollars reported
Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   Atlanta-based Delta's revenue dropped 8% to $3.47 billion, but
that decline was shadowed by an 11.4% drop in operating revenue at
Northwest Airlines Corp. and a 20% plunge in revenue at American.</TE>
<TE>   Southwest, the No. 7 U.S. air carrier, said its operating revenue
slid 5% as travel demand stayed weak in the long wake of Sept. 11.
Dallas-based Southwest expected to post yet another profit in the
third quarter, but said its income should slide from the second
quarter.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts said Southwest had to discount its ticket prices deeply
to attract travelers, but continued to expand its route structure and
gain market share.</TE>
<TE>   Delta executives said the already-tepid recovery in air traffic
and ticket prices turned flat in the second quarter.</TE>
<TE>   "After seeing traffic improvement during each month in the first

President and Chief Operating Officer Frederick Reid said.</TE>
<TE>   Minneapolis-based Northwest, which recorded a wider quarterly loss
of $93 million, or $1.08 a share, said it was confident it would be
one of the airlines leading the faltering industry back to
profitability.</TE>
<TE>   Northwest said its operating unit cost--or expense required to
move one seat one mile--was down 2.2% from a year ago; Delta said it

<HD>Alert Staffing Files for Bankruptcy Protection</HD>
<DH>Services: Dispute with Swiss partner Adecco over financing
terms leads to Culver City firm's cash crunch.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KAREN ROBINSON-JACOBS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Alert Staffing, one of the largest African American owned businesses
in California, has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection as part
of a legal dispute with Adecco, the world's largest employment
agency.</LD>
<LD>   The filing was made last week in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Los
Angeles after unsuccessful attempts by Alert to replace Adecco as a
49% partner in the Culver City employment-services company, said
Victoria Lowe, who founded Alert in 1995 in her living room.</LD>
<LD>   Alert experienced significant growth, pulling in more than $200
million in revenue in 2000 from staffing operations in more than a
dozen states.</LD>
<TE>   Much of that growth, Lowe said, was funded with at least $6
million in financing from Adecco--a Switzerland-based behemoth with
$16.4 billion in annual sales that has been aggressively acquiring
smaller regional chains in the U.S. and abroad. Adecco has more than
6,000 offices in 60 countries.</TE>
<TE>   Spokesmen for Adecco could not be reached for comment.</TE>
<TE>   The funding, and the form and timing of its repayment, is at the
heart of Alert's dispute with Adecco, according to Lowe, who said the
two firms formed a partnership in 1997 to help the smaller company
expand.</TE>
<TE>   Lowe said she and Adecco disagree over the terms of the loan,
which she believes is not due for repayment until next year. Adecco
foreclosed on the loan last fall and sent letters to Alert customers
instructing them to pay Adecco.</TE>
<TE>   Many customers were confused and withheld payment altogether, said
Lowe, "which put us into an immediate cash-flow crunch."</TE>
<TE>   The Bankruptcy Court cleared customers to continue paying Alert,
said Lowe, who added that no layoffs are planned. Alert listed assets
of $10.1 million and debts of $20.6 million in the bankruptcy filing.</TE>
<TE>   Alert has lost business as a result of the dispute, according to
its founder.</TE>
<TE>   With both the economy and Alert's partnership heading south last
year, 2001 sales fell to about $102 million, with no profit, Lowe
said.</TE>
<TE>   "There have been better times, but we'll keep doing what we do
well," said Lowe, who Thursday was named minority business woman of
the year by the Department of Defense. "And we'll just see where God
takes us."</TE>

<HD>Profit for Dole Jumps 81% in Second Quarter</HD>
<DH>Lower tax rate helps results. The firm says it will expense
stock options. Callaway Golf beats expectations.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News and Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Dole Food Co., the world's largest fruit and vegetable producer,
reported strong quarterly earnings Thursday and said it plans to
change the way the company accounts for stock options and leases to
make its financial statements more clear.</LD>
<LD>   The Westlake Village-based company's second-quarter net income
climbed 81% to $66.8 million, or $1.18 a share, from $37 million, or
66 cents, a year earlier, helped in part by a lower tax rate. Sales
in the quarter ended June 15 were flat at $1.12 billion.</LD>
<LD>   Analysts on average were expecting earnings of $1.10, according to
Thomson First Call. Dole said the year-earlier results included an
$8.9-million pretax gain from the sale of investments and a
$28-million pretax expense related primarily to asset write-downs.</LD>
<TE>   Dole said its core businesses, with the exception of fresh-cut
flowers, continued to benefit from improved margins and its
cost-cutting programs.</TE>
<TE>   Dole said the flower industry has proved less attractive than the
company anticipated when it made four acquisitions in the industry in
1998, and integration of the businesses has been slower than
expected. As a result, the company said it would take a charge of
$119.9 million for the write-off of goodwill associated with the
fresh-cut flower business.</TE>
<TE>   Dole also announced that it would begin accounting for all
employee stock options as an expense and would bring $190 million in
operating leases onto its balance sheet.</TE>
<TE>   Many corporations are altering practices in the wake of probes of
firms such as Enron Corp., which used special partnerships to hide
debt and inflate profit.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. rules require only an estimate of option costs in footnotes
to profit statements. Coca-Cola Co., the world's largest soft-drink
maker, and publisher Washington Post Co. said this week that they
would change their options accounting.</TE>
<TE>   Dole's shares fell 28 cents to $26.63 on the New York Stock
Exchange.</TE>
<TE>   Other earnings from Southern California companies:</TE>
<TE>   * Callaway Golf Co. reported a 37% rise in second-quarter net
income to $37.1 million, or 55 cents a share, beating analysts'
forecast of 43 cents. But the company said full-year results would
miss estimates because of a slow economy, less U.S. golf playing and
price competition for golf equipment. Second-quarter results were
helped by controlled costs; its year-earlier results included
one-time costs related to an electricity-supply agreement. Sales
edged up less than 1%.</TE>
<TE>   * Cheesecake Factory Inc. said net income rose 30% to $13.2
million, or 27 cents a share, in its fiscal second quarter, helped by
lower prices for food-related commodities and cost controls. Revenue
rose 25% to $165.4 million, and sales at restaurants open at least a
year were up 1.6%.</TE>
<TE>   * CorVel Corp. reported a 15% increase in second-quarter net
income to $4 million, or 36 cents a share, as revenue jumped 14% to
$58 million. The Irvine-based company said continued growth in its
preferred provider network and medical bill review services and an
acquisition of a diagnostic imaging network contributed to results.</TE>
<TE>   * Jacobs Engineering Group Inc. said net income rose 24% to $27.9
million, or 50 cents a share, in its fiscal third quarter on a 20%
rise in revenue to $1.2 billion.</TE>
<TE>   * Mattel Inc. reported second-quarter earnings of $29.6 million,
or 7 cents a share, primarily because of cost savings, beating
analysts' average estimate of 5 cents. The results exclude one-time
charges for financial restructuring. It posted a loss of $4.9
million, or 1 cent, a year earlier. Sales fell 4% to $804.4 million.</TE>
<TE>   * Reliance Steel &amp; Aluminum Co., a metals distributor and
processor, reported a 6% decline in second-quarter earnings to $10.8
million, or 34 cents a share, as it coped with weak aerospace,
semiconductor and electronics markets. The results were in line with
analysts' expectations. Sales rose 9% to $450.2 million because of
acquisitions.</TE>
<TE>   The Los Angeles-based company forecast third-quarter earnings at
the lower end of the range of Wall Street estimates because it
expects continued declines in the commercial aerospace market and
only a gradual recovery in semiconductor and electronics sales.</TE>
<TE>   * Vans Inc. reported a fiscal fourth-quarter net loss of $14.9
million, or 83 cents a share, including one-time charges, contrasted
with net income of $2.7 million, or 17 cents, a year ago. On an
operating basis, Van's had a loss of $4.4 million, or 24 cents a
share. Sales rose 25% to $63.8 million.</TE>

<HD>Investors Punish Three Drug Firms for Ongoing Woes</HD>
<DH>Pharmaceuticals: Lilly, Bristol-Myers and Baxter shares
fall amid such problems as slow sales, product denials by FDA.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RONALD D. WHITE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Investors were greeted Thursday by another unwelcome reminder of what
a difference a year has made in certain segments of the health-care
industry, as three companies--Eli Lilly &amp; Co., Bristol-Myers Squibb
Co. and Baxter International Inc.--reported a wide range of ongoing
problems.</LD>
<LD>   Lilly executives acknowledged in its second-quarter earnings
report that manufacturing and quality-control problems cited by the
Food and Drug Administration in November would significantly slow
production of several new drugs as the company wrestles to meet
federal requirements.</LD>
<LD>   The company also reported that net income for the quarter was down
20% to $659 million, or 61 cents a share, compared with $828 million,
or 76 cents, a year ago. It was Lilly's third consecutive earnings
decline of 20% or more.</LD>
<TE>   "We still have more work to do, especially at certain Indianapolis
facilities," said Lilly Senior Vice President Pedro P. Granadillo,
later adding that Lilly needed to continue to refine its quality
standards and "improve our ability to find the root cause of
manufacturing deviations."</TE>
<TE>   Lilly reported that net sales were down 9% in the quarter, to
$2.78 billion. The company also lowered its 2002 earnings forecast to
$2.60 to $2.62 a share from $2.60 to $2.65.</TE>
<TE>   Lilly shares finished the day at $48.54, down $2.36, or 4.6%, on
the New York Stock Exchange.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, it appeared that Bristol-Myers Squibb was about to lose
a long-running battle to gain FDA approval of its new
high-blood-pressure drug, Vanlev. FDA medical reviewers Thursday said
the drug should not be approved because of safety concerns. An FDA
advisory panel is scheduled to take up the Vanlev matter today to
recommend approval or denial of the drug.</TE>
<TE>   The company will release its second-quarter earnings next week.</TE>
<TE>   Bristol-Myers shares Thursday plummeted 6.8% on the NYSE, down
$1.63 to $22.50.</TE>
<TE>   But investors delivered the sharpest rebuke of the day to Baxter
International, sending shares of the health-care products company
down $11.41, or 26.3%, to $32 on the NYSE. That followed news that
Deerfield, Ill.-based Baxter posted disappointing sales in the second
quarter and took a large charge related to its acquisition of Fusion
Medical Technologies, along with a $70-million charge for the decline
in market value of minority stakes it holds in two public companies.</TE>
<TE>   Baxter reported net earnings of $200 million, or 32 cents a share,
down from $253 million, or 42 cents, last year. Sales rose 8% to
$2.02 billion, but were $100 million short of estimates.</TE>
<TE>   One year ago, Lilly was touted as one of the big drug companies
best prepared to weather the end of patent protection for a
blockbuster drug--in Lilly's case, Prozac. Second-quarter sales of
Prozac products declined 72% from last year, to $195 million.
Analysts had praised Lilly's ramped-up research and development as
well as a pipeline of promising new drugs.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, Lilly's would-be blockbuster, Xigris, for treatment of
bloodstream bacterial infections known as sepsis, posted another flat
sales quarter of $23 million, far from the full-year 2002 sales
projection of $600 million.</TE>
<TE>   "In all candor, we thought that new products might come out
sporadically next year, but they might not get any new products next
year. The mantra is uncertainty," said SG Cowen Securities analyst
Stephen Scala. "Hopefully, they will be back on track in 2004."</TE>
<TE>   Bristol-Myers' outlook for a reversal of fortune with Vanlev are
so bleak that analysts didn't even wait for a final decision from the
FDA. "We've all reduced our Vanlev profit numbers to zero because the
drug has problems. We are anticipating no future profit," said Morgan
Stanley analyst Jami Rubin.</TE>
<TE>   One year ago, Bristol-Myers reported a 10% rise in quarterly
profit to $1.1 billion, or 56 cents a share, driven by cost-cutting
and robust sales of drugs such as Glucophage for diabetes and the
anti-clotting drug Plavix.</TE>
<TE>   But the company was about to formalize its biggest blunder, an
ill-fated $2-billion purchase of the rights to market the anti-cancer
drug Erbitux, made by ImClone Systems Inc. That deal now is facing
regulatory scrutiny, along with a new Securities and Exchange
Commission investigation of Bristol-Myers' use of sales incentives
that boosted revenue by $1 billion last year.</TE>

<HD>FBI Agents Named in Elgindy Associate Case</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>A former FBI agent charged in an insider-trading case gave stock tips
to at least two other agents in 2000 while he was still working for
the agency, according to a potential witness.</LD>
<LD>   The agents were named in court papers unsealed Thursday in
Brooklyn during a hearing for Jeffrey Royer, a former agent charged
in May with conspiring with Internet stock analyst Amr "Tony" Elgindy
of San Diego and another FBI agent to commit fraud.</LD>
<LD>   U.S. District Judge Raymond Dearie jailed Royer after learning he
may have violated his bail by contacting a former girlfriend, Christy
Sarkey. He had been free on $500,000 bond.</LD>
<TE>   In a recent letter to the judge, prosecutors accused Royer of
calling and writing to Sarkey within days of his June release,
despite Dearie's orders to stay away from potential witnesses.</TE>
<TE>   The letter argued that Sarkey, who is a police officer in
Oklahoma, was a potential witness because Royer, while investigating
stock fraud for the FBI in 2000, used inside information to give her
a stock tip.</TE>
<TE>   In an interview with the FBI, Sarkey said that she lost $4,000 on
the deal and that "she knows that other agents and perhaps some
support staff personnel invested with Royer," according to a report
unsealed Thursday. Sarkey named two agents, Charles Ruiz in New York
and Todd Temple in San Diego, as investors.</TE>
<TE>   Neither the report nor any other court document accuses Ruiz or
Temple of wrongdoing.</TE>
<TE>   Ruiz said Thursday that he was aware his name had surfaced in the
case, but he declined further comment. A call to Temple wasn't
returned.</TE>
<TE>   On Wednesday, an Elgindy associate, Derrick Cleveland, pleaded
guilty to racketeering conspiracy as part of a deal with prosecutors
to testify for the government.</TE>

<HD>Committee Probes Shredding Claims</HD>
<DH>Telecom: House energy panel is looking into allegations
that Global Crossing employees destroyed evidence.</DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The House Energy and Commerce Committee, in a probe similar to one
launched this month by the Justice Department, is looking into claims
of document shredding at Global Crossing Ltd.</LD>
<LD>   Committee Chairman W.J. "Billy" Tauzin (R-La.) and James C.
Greenwood (R-Pa.), chairman of the House subcommittee on oversight
and investigations, sent a four-page letter to Global Crossing Chief
Executive John Legere this week demanding information about Global's
"document retention policy" as well as a list of employees who had
access to key company financial documents.</LD>
<LD>   "It is the committee's understanding that ... individuals employed
by Global Crossing ... are alleged to have destroyed documents,"
Tauzin and Greenwood wrote.</LD>
<TE>   The letter indicates that Congress has not depleted its
investigative resources despite a growing list of corporate financial
scandals, including Enron Corp., WorldCom Inc. and ImClone Systems
Inc.</TE>
<TE>   "We take allegations of document destruction very seriously, and
we are going to get to the bottom of this one way or another," said
committee spokesman Ken Johnson.</TE>
<TE>   Doc shredding at Global first surfaced in a lawsuit brought
this year by the Ohio State Retirement Systems pension fund, which
lost more than $100 million from its investments in the fiber-optic
giant, which filed the fourth-largest bankruptcy in U.S. history in
late January.</TE>
<TE>   Company receptionist Cathleen Kicak said in a sworn affidavit
filed in the pension fund suit that she saw two employees leave a
storage room that contained a shredding machine at the Madison, N.J.,
headquarters.</TE>
<TE>   Kicak said she did not see the employees shredding documents but
heard the machine operating just before they left.</TE>
<TE>   In its letter to Global Crossing, the Commerce Committee
identified the employees as the son-in-law and the administrative
assistant of Joseph P. Perrone Sr., the company's executive vice
president of finance.</TE>
<TE>   The committee has been looking into allegations that Global
engaged in questionable accounting practices similar to those of
Enron.</TE>

<HD>Stocks Slide on Tech Pullback</HD>
<DH>Wall Street: S&amp;P sinks to a five-year low as anxious
investors sell after one-day rally.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOSH FRIEDMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A late sell-off sent major stock indexes sharply lower Thursday, as
Wednesday's rally proved to be as short-lived as several others in
recent months.</LD>
<LD>   Technology stocks, which had been bolstering the market in recent
days, led the way down, with the Nasdaq composite index shedding
40.30 points, or 2.9%, to 1,356.95, bringing its year-to-date loss to
more than 30%.</LD>
<LD>   The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index sank to a five-year low, down
24.48 points, or 2.7%, to 881.56, while the Dow Jones industrial
average fell 132.99 points, or 1.6%, to 8,409.49, lowest since
September.</LD>
<TE>   Analysts said the losses reflect investors' unwillingness to leave
their money in a market that shows no signs of a sustained
turnaround. The tech sector's pullback was a particular
disappointment, although Nasdaq did hold above last week's five-year
low.</TE>
<TE>   "In the 1990s the mantra among mom-and-pop investors was, 'Buy on
the dips,' " said Chris Orndorff, head of equities at Payden &amp; Rygel
in Los Angeles. "Now that mantra seems to be, 'Sell into the
rallies.' "</TE>
<TE>   In July alone, three rallies have sputtered after one or two
sessions. Orndorff said the rash of recent corporate scandals has
damaged investor psychology.</TE>
<TE>   "Individuals understand corporate profits slowing or business
being bad during a recession, but what has negatively affected so
many people's views is this series of accounting irregularities and
other scandals," Orndorff said. "I hate to liken the stock market to
gambling, but if you go to a casino and lose fair and square, you'll
probably go back--but not if you feel like you've been cheated."</TE>
<TE>   A key sign of investors' disillusionment is mounting redemptions
from stock mutual funds. TrimTabs.com Investment Research estimated
that a net $19.3 billion was redeemed from equity funds in the week
ended Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   In Thursday's trading, the major indexes closed near their lowest
levels of the day after hovering in mixed territory for much of the
session. Losers swamped winners by more than 2 to 1 on the New York
Stock Exchange and Nasdaq, on active volume.</TE>
<TE>   Despite some upbeat corporate earnings reports this week, other
reports have reminded investors that the economic recovery hasn't
been evenly distributed.</TE>
<TE>   Disappointing results late Wednesday from chip maker Advanced
Micro Devices and software maker Siebel Systems, and a cautious
outlook early Thursday from cell phone giant Nokia, weighed on the
tech sector.</TE>
<TE>   AMD, which reported a wider-than-expected second-quarter loss,
slid 61 cents to $8.72, while Siebel, which had a second-quarter
shortfall and issued a third-quarter profit warning, plunged $2.12 to
$9.62. Nokia fell 79 cents to $13.33.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, longer-term Treasury bond yields sank as the latest
economic data underscored that the recovery is far from robust. The
yield on the 2-year T-note fell to 2.49% from 2.61%.</TE>
<TE>   Among the day's highlights:</TE>
<TE>   * Automatic Data Processing plummeted $9.75 to $31.60 after the
payroll-services company warned of slower profit growth next year.
Rival Paychex fell $3.72 to $24.50.</TE>
<TE>   * In the ailing drug sector, Eli Lilly lost $2.36 to $48.54 after
reducing its profit target for this year. Bristol-Myers Squibb sagged
$1.63 to $22.50 after regulators said a blood pressure drug should
not be approved because of its side effects. Also, medical device and
vaccine maker Baxter International tumbled $11.41 to $32 after saying
revenue rose less than analysts expected.</TE>
<TE>   * Among biotech stocks, Biogen sank $2.20 to $32.85 after
reporting a drop in second-quarter profit. Amgen fell $3.18 to
$33.92.</TE>
<TE>   * In the financial sector, PNC Financial dropped $6.91 to $39.69
after saying profit may be hurt by a deal with U.S. regulators over
how the company accounted for units it created with insurer American
International Group. AIG fell $3.67 to $57.23.</TE>
<TE>   * IBM defied the downtrend, adding $1.36 to $72.05 after reporting
a quarterly net profit.</TE>

<HD>Oakley Earnings Beat Expectations</HD>

<AU>LESLIE EARNEST</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Sunglass maker Oakley Inc., regaining ground lost in a dispute with
its largest customer, said Thursday that second-quarter earnings
slightly beat analysts' expectations.</LD>
<LD>   With demand strong for its sunglasses and other products, Oakley
also boosted its profit expectations for the year to 83 cents a
share, which would be a 15.3% increase from 2001.</LD>
<LD>   Earnings in the quarter slipped to $22.3 million, or 32 cents a
share, compared with $23.6 million, or 34 cents, during the
comparable period last year. Analysts were expecting 31 cents a
share. Last year's second quarter included a tax-rate cut that added
3 cents a share to Oakley's earnings.</LD>
<TE>   Sales in the quarter ended June 30 rose to $145.1 million, a 10.6%
increase from the comparable period last year. That was less than
some analysts were expecting, partly because the company had trouble
filling demand due to a shortage of raw materials for making
sunglasses.</TE>
<TE>   "Basically, management needs to do a better job of forecasting
demand for their product, and I think that's what we'll see going
forward," said Kristine Koerber, an analyst with WR Hambrecht &amp; Co.
Although unit sales dropped 9%, sunglass sales rose 5%, driven by a
15.3% increase in the average selling price.</TE>
<TE>   Still, the results show that Oakley has recovered from challenges
it faced last year, the company said in a statement. Oakley's sales
slid in the second half of last year when its biggest customer,
Sunglass Hut, slashed orders after being acquired by competitor
Luxottica Group. Oakley and Luxottica have since patched up their
differences.</TE>
<TE>   The results pleased investors, who boosted the stock price by
$1.23, to $15.25 on the New York Stock Exchange. The stock is down
$7.75 for the year.</TE>
<TE>   Foothill Ranch-based Oakley, which built its brand by selling
trendy sunglasses, in recent years also began making clothing, shoes,
watches and prescription eyewear. Sales of those products grew 47.9%
to $32.4 million in the quarter, accounting for 20.3% of sales.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>WorldCom Inc. may file the biggest bankruptcy petition in U.S.
history as early as Sunday to cope with creditors owed more than $35
billion, people close to the situation said.</LD>
<LD>   Meanwhile, a federal judge approved an agreement between WorldCom
and a group of banks in which WorldCom will freeze certain assets
while the banks temporarily halt legal proceedings aimed at
recovering a $2.5-billion loan.</LD>
<LD>   U.S. District Judge Jed Rakoff approved the agreement after all 25
banks that have sued WorldCom said they would sign off on the deal.</LD>
<TE>   "We're declining to comment on any speculation" about a bankruptcy
filing, Julie Moore, a WorldCom spokeswoman, said.</TE>
<TE>   Chapter 11 would keep creditors at bay and suspend lawsuits
against WorldCom as it tries to restructure its debts under existing
management. The second-biggest long-distance phone company, with
$21.3 billion in 2001 sales, has more than 20 million customers and
carries most of the U.S.'s Internet traffic.</TE>

<LD>Transmeta Corp., an upstart chip maker trying to compete with giant
Intel Corp., reported a second-quarter loss and said it plans to cut
its work force by 40%, or 200 employees.</LD>
<LD>   The company lost $35.6 million, or 27 cents a share, compared with

28% to $7.54 million. Revenue for the third quarter will be flat to
up 5%, the company said.</LD>
<LD>   Transmeta, whose Crusoe processor is used mostly by Japanese
computer makers, also said it canceled plans to release its

<LD>The U.S. index of leading economic indicators was unchanged in June,
the third time in the last four months without an increase, dampened
by falling stock prices and sagging consumer confidence.</LD>
<LD>   The lack of movement in the Conference Board's measure of future
economic activity followed a rise of 0.6% in May, larger than
previously reported.</LD>
<LD>   The Labor Department said in a separate report that new claims for
unemployment insurance fell last week by 28,000 to 379,000, the
lowest level in 17 months. The more stable four-week moving average
of new claims,edged down to 391,000, the lowest level since the

<DL></DL>
<LD>PNC Financial Services Group Inc. avoided monetary penalties, but
will face stricter federal scrutiny after regulators questioned its
accounting and record-keeping practices.</LD>
<LD>   The Securities and Exchange Commission said the bank tried to
conceal $762 million in potential liabilities last year by
transferring them to three subsidiaries created for that purpose.</LD>
<LD>   The Pittsburgh-based bank and federal regulators announced that
PNC would give the SEC and the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland
greater access to company records and tighter control of mergers or
acquisitions.</LD>
<TE>   Federal regulators said PNC wanted to keep various capital
investments and "volatile, troubled or under-performing loans" from
affecting its bottom line in the second, third and fourth quarters by
transferring them to three subsidiaries created with insurance giant
American International Group Inc.</TE>
<TE>   The bank did not admit any wrongdoing, but reduced its 2001 profit
by $155 million to $412 million in January after federal regulators
questioned the accounting.</TE>
<TE>   AIG has said it didn't take part in the transactions and didn't
revise its earnings.</TE>
<TE>   PNC's stock tumbled $6.91, or 14.8%, to $39.69 on the NYSE.</TE>

<HD>Sun Microsystems Returns to Profitability</HD>
<DH>Earnings: The server maker's results meet expectations.
EBay posts record net income.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Sun Microsystems Inc., maker of servers that run Web sites and
corporate networks, returned to modest profitability in its latest
quarter after a year of losses.</LD>
<LD>   But the firm said it expects to post a small loss in the current
quarter.</LD>
<LD>   For the quarter ended June 30, Santa Clara, Calif.-based Sun
earned $20 million, or 1 cent a share, contrasted with a loss of $88
million, or 3 cents, in the same period a year earlier.</LD>
<TE>   Revenue was $3.4 billion, down 17% from a year earlier. The
results met analyst expectations.</TE>
<TE>   The company's outlook didn't cheer investors: Sun shares, up 12
cents to $5.80 in regular Nasdaq trading, fell to $4.90 in
after-hours trading, following a warning from Sun's chief financial
officer, Steve McGowan, that sales are "very difficult."</TE>
<TE>   For its full fiscal 2002, Sun reported sales of $12.5 billion,
down 32%. The firm posted a loss of $628 million, or 19 cents a
share, contrasted with a $927-million profit, or 27 cents, in 2001.</TE>
<TE>   In other earnings Thursday:</TE>
<TE>   * EBay Inc. continued to be a bright spot in the troubled
e-commerce sector, announcing record net income of $54.3 million, or
19 cents a share, for the second quarter, up 121% from the same
period last year.</TE>
<TE>   Revenue for the online auctioneer rose 47% to $266.3 million from
$180.9 million a year earlier. San Jose-based EBay has been
profitable every quarter since going public in September 1998.</TE>
<TE>   EBay Chief Executive Meg Whitman said in a conference call to
analysts that next week the company would introduce its first
non-auction, fixed-price option for sellers.</TE>
<TE>   * Broadcom Corp., the largest maker of chips for cable modems,
said revenue grew and losses narrowed in the second quarter as the
company expanded its offerings to weather a steep downturn in
technology spending.</TE>
<TE>   Including costs related to acquisitions and other items, the
Irvine company lost $129.4 million, or 49 cents a share, compared
with $436.4 million, or $1.73, in the year-earlier period.</TE>
<TE>   Excluding those charges, Broadcom's loss narrowed to $16.8
million, or 6 cents a share, from $41.1 million, or 16 cents, a year
earlier. Sales rose 22% to $258.2 million.</TE>
<TE>   * Gateway Inc., the No. 3 U.S. maker of personal computers, lost
$61.2 million in the second quarter, or 19 cents a share, compared
with $20.8 million, or 6 cents, a year earlier. Analysts had
predicted a 17-cent loss. Sales fell 33% to $1 billion.</TE>
<TE>   * Communications chip maker Vitesse Semiconductor Corp. said its
net loss widened to $735.9 million, or $3.71 a share, including
$695.5 million in charges stemming from the write-down of assets and
other one-time items. The firm had a net loss of $69.6 million, or 38
cents a share, a year ago.</TE>
<TE>   Excluding charges, Vitesse posted a $20.6-million loss, or 10
cents a share, compared with $11.9 million, or 6 cents, a year
earlier. Sales fell 28% to $43 million.</TE>
<TE>   * Aliso Viejo-based computer storage networking company QLogic
Corp. posted a profit of $23.1 million, or 24 cents a share, in its
fiscal first quarter, up from $19.2 million, or 20 cents a share, a
year earlier.</TE>
<TE>   Revenue for the quarter ended June 30 rose 9% to $100.8 million.</TE>

<HD>Chrysler Boosts Parent's Earnings</HD>
<DH>Autos: Daimler credits 52% jump in profit and upbeat 2002
forecast to U.S. unit's overhaul.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TERRIL YUE JONES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>DETROIT</DL>
<LD>The struggling Chrysler Group finally broke into net profitability in
the second quarter, spurring its parent company, DaimlerChrysler, to
a 52% leap in profit and to increase its earnings forecast for the
full year.</LD>
<LD>   DaimlerChrysler Chief Executive Juergen Schrempp credited the
$777-million operating profit at Chrysler Group--made up of the
Chrysler, Dodge and Jeep brands--to the overhaul that began 18 months
ago. In turn, he said, the restructuring has produced strong results
for the parent, which also produces Mercedes-Benz cars and trucks.</LD>
<LD>   "Good progress with restructuring, high cost savings and
efficiency improvements justify our assumptions that Chrysler should
report a positive result for the second half of 2002, despite
difficult market conditions, and should thus achieve an operating
profit for the year as a whole," Schrempp said in a conference call
from Germany with analysts and reporters.</LD>
<TE>   It was the third straight day of better-than-expected earnings
releases from Detroit's Big Three auto makers. On Tuesday, General
Motors Corp. said it earned $1.3 billion in the quarter, and Ford
Motor Co., which lost $5.45 billion last year, said Wednesday that it
made a profit of $570 million.</TE>
<TE>   "The news from all three was good, but some additional good news
is on the way: There is likely to be weakening of the dollar," said
Paul Taylor, chief economist for the National Automobile Dealers
Assn.</TE>
<TE>   The strong dollar has helped importers that build cars and trucks
overseas, as their products became more affordable when denominated
in dollars. As a result of that and the Sept. 11 attacks, which
brought vehicle purchases to a near-standstill, the Big Three
launched deep discounting in the form of rebates and interest-free
loans.</TE>
<TE>   The interest-free financing was revived by GM this month, quickly
followed by Ford and Chrysler, and is one reason auto sales have
remained strong, reaching a near-record pace this month.</TE>
<TE>   "The current incentives are very aggressive and definitely have
consumers out buying new vehicles," said Walter McManus, executive
director of global forecasting at J.D. Power &amp; Associates, in a study
issued Thursday. "We expect this could be one of the top five highest
sales months in history" on a seasonally adjusted basis.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. auto industry raced to a record 17.4 million sales in
2000 and a second-best 17.1 million in 2001. July 2002 sales,
however, were running at a seasonally adjusted rate of 18.1 million,
the J.D. Power study said.</TE>
<TE>   The beating the stock market has taken in recent weeks actually
might prompt consumers to consider a big-ticket item such as a new
car.</TE>
<TE>   "Americans might say, 'My 401(k) looks shot and my dollar won't
have the same purchasing power next year, so I'll lock in my
[Mercedes] S-class or Audi A6 now,' " the dealer group's Taylor said.
"It's a good time to buy European luxury cars, but it's also a good
time to buy American luxury cars because there are some phenomenal
financing deals available."</TE>
<TE>   Analysts see things continuing well for the industry.</TE>
<TE>   "The economy is fine. Interest rates are benign," said Michael
Bruynesteyn, auto analyst for Prudential Securities. "The average
consumer feels some pain in his 401(k), but for most people the bulk
of their wealth is in their home, so they're feeling pretty good."</TE>
<TE>   Chrysler Group's operating profit contrasts with a loss in last
year's second quarter of $146 million. Though Chrysler was hit with a
restructuring charge of $369 million, it still posted a net profit,
said DaimlerChrysler, which does not release net figures for the
unit. Last quarter Chrysler Group posted its first operating profit,
$111 million, after six consecutive quarters of losses, but was hit
by a one-time $300-million restructuring charge that left the
U.S.-based operations with another net loss.</TE>
<TE>   Altogether, the Chrysler Group had an operating loss of $1.9
billion last year.</TE>
<TE>   Stuttgart, Germany-based DaimlerChrysler's operating profit for
the second quarter was $1.2 billion, or $1.19 a share, up from $500
million, or 52 cents a share, in the second quarter of 2001. Net
profit was $1.1 billion, or $1.08 a share, compared with $700
million, or 72 cents a share, in last year's second quarter.</TE>
<TE>   Quarterly revenue was $38.8 billion, down from $40.8 billion a
year earlier.</TE>
<TE>   DaimlerChrysler's original forecast was for 2002 operating profit
to be twice the 1.3 billion euros reached in 2001. Schrempp said
Thursday that the company should realize "well more than three times"
that figure for 2002.</TE>
<TE>   DaimlerChrysler shares closed at $47.55 Thursday, up 85 cents, on
the New York Stock Exchange.</TE>

<HD>Microsoft Edges Forecasts on Strong Software Sales</HD>
<DH>Technology: Analysts say firm's performance is encouraging
amid the slumping PC market.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOSEPH MENN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Microsoft Corp. slightly beat Wall Street expectations for its fiscal
fourth quarter on a 10% jump in sales, offering a rare sign of
encouragement as other technology companies continue to slump.</LD>
<LD>   The world's biggest software maker reported profit of $2.34
billon, or 43 cents a share, before the latest in a series of charges
to write down the value of its investments. A year earlier, it earned
$2.6 billion, or 47 cents, before similar charges.</LD>
<LD>   Analysts had been expecting Microsoft to post per-share earnings
of 42 cents on sales of $7.1 billion.</LD>
<TE>   But revenue climbed to $7.25 billion instead, despite falling
sales of personal computers powered by Microsoft's flagship Windows
operating system.</TE>
<TE>   "The quarter was very solid, particularly considering the
environment, and they're largely sticking with their outlook, which
is good," said Banc of America Securities analyst Robert Austrian,
who doesn't own Microsoft shares.</TE>
<TE>   Microsoft took a charge of $806 million from falling investments,
mostly in telecommunications and cable companies.</TE>
<TE>   Shares fell 89 cents to $51.11 in regular Nasdaq trading, then
eased to $51 in after-hours trading following the earnings report.
The broader market also fell.</TE>
<TE>   For the fiscal year ended June 30, Microsoft net income rose to
$7.8 billion from $7.3 billion as sales increased to $28.4 billion
from $25.3 billion.</TE>
<TE>   For the coming year, Microsoft slightly lowered its forecast, to
earnings per share of between $1.85 and $1.91 on revenue ranging from
$3.14 billion to $3.2 billion, up 11% to 13% from the year just
ended.</TE>
<TE>   The company's performance was remarkable, analysts said, because
sales increased even as shipments of personal computers fell for the
first time since the mid-1980s. Windows is installed on the vast
majority of PCs.</TE>
<TE>   "We executed remarkably well," said Microsoft Controller Scott
Boggs. "I don't think anyone imagined we would see a decline of 4%"
in personal computer sales.</TE>
<TE>   The results showed Microsoft is succeeding in pressing business
customers to shift to new types of agreements allowing their
employees to use Windows and the Office package of word-processing
and spreadsheet software.</TE>
<TE>   Many customers balked at the new terms, which require higher
annual fees in return for upgrades and maintenance. Microsoft twice
extended the deadline for joining the programs.</TE>
<TE>   "Microsoft has done a very good job of leveraging their position
with large businesses," Austrian said. "This is their secret sauce."</TE>
<TE>   Overall sales of desktop operating systems increased 20% to $2.4
billion, boosted by the introduction last fall of Windows XP. And
unearned revenue, which reflects money to be collected later under
the long-term agreements, rose 59% from a year earlier. The company
added $2 billion of such anticipated sales and now has a total of
$7.7 billion, of which $6 billion should be collected in the new
fiscal year.</TE>
<TE>   Microsoft also spent more heavily in the fourth quarter than ever
before to buy back its falling stock, acquiring $4.8 billion worth of
shares.</TE>
<TE>   Microsoft's profitability was diminished by marketing expenses to
launch Windows XP and the Xbox game console. Sales of the consoles
also hurt the bottom line, because they sell for less than they cost
to make.</TE>
<TE>   Microsoft said it has sold 3.9 million Xbox consoles since they
debuted in November, meeting the company's lowered internal forecast
of 3.5 million to 4 million units. The company had projected sales of
as many as 6 million units, but revised estimates due to weak sales
in Japan and Europe. A $100 price cut to $199 helped spur sales of
the device.</TE>

<HD>Losses Pile Up at Battered Telecom Firms</HD>
<DH>Earnings: Sprint, Sprint PCS, Level 3 and Nortel report
shortfalls, but Nokia posts a profit. The outlook for the industry
remains cloudy.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELIZABETH DOUGLASS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Signs of recovery in the crippled telecommunications industry were
nowhere to be found in the latest batch of earnings reports, as
several of the sector's biggest players Thursday announced continuing
losses and tempered expectations for the future.</LD>
<LD>   But much of the bad news was expected, and investors showed their
relief by boosting the shares of Sprint Corp., Sprint PCS Group and
Level 3 Communications Inc.</LD>
<LD>   Shares of cell phone giant Nokia, which reported a profit, and
troubled Canadian equipment maker Nortel Networks Corp., which
reported a smaller loss, fell slightly.</LD>
<TE>   Sprint, the nation's third-largest long-distance carrier, said its
second-quarter loss on a consolidated basis--the combination of its
wireless and other businesses--ballooned by 46% to $63 million, from
a $43-million deficit a year earlier. Consolidated sales rose 5.9% to
$6.83 billion</TE>
<TE>   The Overland Park, Kan.-based company has cut costs, jobs and
capital spending to keep its debt rating from falling to "junk"
status. It will soon sell its phone directory unit for as much as $2
billion to further improve its cash position.</TE>
<TE>   Sprint's report "kind of helped ease some fears....They're dealing
with their funding, and they may get some decent bids for their
directory business," said Rick Grubbs, an analyst at Credit Lyonnais
Securities who lists Sprint's phone business as a "hold" and its
wireless business as a "buy." He does not own either Sprint stock,
and his firm does not have banking business with Sprint.</TE>
<TE>   Sprint shares rose 41 cents to $9.16 on the New York Stock
Exchange.</TE>
<TE>   Sprint's long-distance, data, Internet and local phone
businesses--which trade separately as the FON group--continued to
suffer from revenue challenges such as falling prices and slack
demand, said Sprint Chairman William T. Esrey. FON group sales fell
8% to $3.97 billion--the unit's sixth straight quarterly sales
decline.</TE>
<TE>   The FON group's profit plunged 65% to $102 million, or 12 cents a
share, from $290 million, or 33 cents, a year earlier. Excluding the
write-down of its investment in Internet provider EarthLink Inc. and
other one-time items, the quarterly profit equaled 36 cents a share,
slightly higher than analysts' expectations of 31 cents to 35 cents.</TE>
<TE>   Sprint's wireless business, which trades as PCS, saw its revenue
jump 32%, but its losses were higher than expected, totaling $170
million, or 17 cents a share. Still, that's a 31% improvement on the
deficit of $247 million, or 26 cents a share, a year earlier.</TE>
<TE>   The PCS unit met lowered expectations by adding 308,000
subscribers and described its forecast of 2.5 million to 2.7 million
new customers for the year "challenging but achievable."</TE>
<TE>   Shares in Sprint's FON business rose 56 cents to $12.26, while
shares in the PCS group rose 50 cents to $5.50 in regular trading,
both on the NYSE.</TE>
<TE>   Nokia, the world's biggest cell phone maker, said its
second-quarter profit rose 46% despite a 6% decline in sales.</TE>
<TE>   The Espoo, Finland-based company earned $862 million in the
quarter ended June 30 as cell phone unit sales rose 12%. However, the
company lowered the low end of its earnings estimate for the full
year and reduced its estimate for industrywide handset sales to about
400 million units, which brings its forecast in line with the one
announced by rival Motorola Inc. this week.</TE>
<TE>   "From January through March, the handset market was showing some
signs that demand was recovering, but that recovery appears to have
stalled out a bit," said Mark Roberts of Wachovia Securities. His
firm rates Nokia a "buy," but Roberts does not own Nokia shares, and
his firm does not have banking business with Nokia.</TE>
<TE>   Nokia's U.S.-listed shares fell 79 cents to $13.33 on the NYSE.</TE>
<TE>   Nortel Networks, which released its second-quarter results after
the markets closed, reported a narrower loss of $697 million, or 20
cents a share, an improvement over the second period in 2001, when
acquisition-related costs pushed the company's losses to $19.4
billion, or $6.08 a share.</TE>
<TE>   Excluding special charges and gains, acquisition costs and the
cost of stock options, Nortel's quarterly loss totaled $323 million,
or 9 cents a share, in line with analyst estimates of a loss of 7
cents to 9 cents. The year-earlier deficit, without one-time items,
totaled $1.55 billion, or 48 cents a share.</TE>
<TE>   Brampton, Canada-based Nortel continued to be pummeled by
disappearing demand for telecommunications equipment, as its sales
plummeted 40% to $2.77 billion from $4.6 billion. On average,
analysts had expected sales of about $2.8 billion.</TE>
<TE>   With demand showing no sign of improving, Nortel plans to chop
3,500 more jobs from its payroll, which already has been cut in half.
The company's stock fell 4 cents to $1.31 in Thursday trading before
Nortel's earnings were announced.</TE>
<TE>   Level 3's second-quarter loss narrowed as the fiber-optic network
operator's sales almost doubled on software sales and recently
acquired companies.</TE>
<TE>   The net loss narrowed to $156 million, or 39 cents a share, from
$731 million, or $1.99, a year earlier. Revenue rose to $750 million
from $387 million. Investors pushed the stock up 5 cents to $5.77 on
Nasdaq.</TE>
<TE>   Broomfield, Colo.-based Level 3 said its core telecommunications
business continued to falter, with sales falling to $276 million from
$329 million a year earlier.</TE>
<TE>   "The message they're sending is it's still ugly out there," said
Daniel Zito, an analyst at Legg Mason Wood Walker Inc., which lists
Level 3 as a "sell."</TE>

<HD>Two Parts of a Whole</HD>
<DH>New team could lead to a management culture that prevailed
before the merger</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SALLIE HOFMEISTER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The two veteran media executives Jeffrey Bewkes and Don Logan--named
Thursday as deputies to AOL Time Warner Inc. Chief Executive Richard
D. Parsons--possess what one colleague describes as "ego-less
maturity," a rarity in the self-aggrandizing entertainment industry.</LD>
<LD>   "Both of them are very low-key but very talented," said Jessica
Reif Cohen, an analyst at Merrill Lynch.</LD>
<LD>   Bewkes, 50, who has spent 23 years at Home Box Office, becomes
chairman of the new Entertainment and Networks Group. He will oversee
HBO, Warner Bros. Studio, New Line Cinema, the WB Network, Turner
Broadcasting Systems Inc. and Warner Music. These businesses are home
to CNN, TBS, Cartoon Network, and recording artists such as Madonna
and the Red Hot Chili Peppers. Logan, 58, who had overseen the
world's biggest magazine group, joined Time Inc. as president in
1992. He now becomes chairman of the newly formed Media and
Communications Group, made up of struggling Internet giant America
Online; Time Inc.; Time Warner Cable, the nation's second-largest
cable system; the AOL Time Warner Book Group; and the Interactive
Video unit.</LD>
<TE>   Several AOL Time Warner executives said that in contrast to
departing Chief Operating Officer Robert W. Pittman, Bewkes and Logan
are under-the-radar managers who shy from the media spotlight and
delegate power to their lieutenants.</TE>
<TE>   The management overhaul leaves Chairman Steve Case, one of the
architects of the merger, without his closest ally. The new structure
could lead to a decentralized management culture that prevailed at
Time Warner before the AOL merger last year, according to AOL Time
Warner insiders.</TE>
<TE>   Media executives applaud Parsons for matching Bewkes' and Logan's
management styles to their new assignments.</TE>
<TE>   "Dick's got them lined up in the jobs that best suit each of their
styles," said Richard Bressler, chief financial officer of media
rival Viacom Inc. and former finance chief of Time Warner. Bewkes
"has the ability to build consensus and has more sensitivity for the
artistic community," Bressler said. "When I was at Time Warner, we
all assumed he'd run the company one day."</TE>
<TE>   In contrast, Logan is more like Bressler's new boss, Viacom's
take-no-prisoners president, Mel Karmazin. "Don would rather go
fishing than walk down the red carpet at the Oscars," Bressler said.
"Don is the finest operating executive within Time Warner. When you
left the room, there was no ambiguity as to how you would be judged
or the consequences if you didn't live up to your promises."</TE>
<TE>   Other rival media executives also were impressed by Parsons'
choices.</TE>
<TE>   "These are the two best executives in the company," said Peter
Chernin, chief operating officer of rival News Corp. He credited
Logan with launching such new magazines as In Style and Teen People
during one of the worst advertising climates in decades in the
publishing business.</TE>
<TE>   He said Bewkes has proven his skills at both the creative and
financial sides of the business, and had moved HBO beyond offering
just theatrical and TV movies by expanding into original series, such
as "The Sopranos" and "Sex and the City."</TE>
<TE>   Bewkes rose from finance chief to chief executive of HBO in May
1995, after the ouster of Michael Fuchs. He joined HBO in 1979, in
the fledgling network's sales and marketing department.</TE>
<TE>   Still, some analysts and industry executives wonder whether the
new AOL Time Warner management team obscures the lines of authority.</TE>
<TE>   "With three or four people at the top, it's ambiguous who is
really in charge," one industry source said.</TE>
<TE>   Others questioned where the killer instinct is at the top of AOL
Time Warner's management, which has to wrestle with the tough
assignment of turning around America Online and restoring the parent
company's credibility on Wall Street. Many investors have wondered
for months whether Parsons is too laid back for the CEO job.</TE>
<TE>   Yet several AOL Time Warner insiders said the executive trio would
help calm the waters. And they applauded Parsons for promoting two
highly sought-after executives.</TE>
<TE>   Several years ago, Bewkes turned down the opportunity to head up
Warner Bros. Because he was unwilling to move to Los Angeles. More
recently, he was asked to take over Time Warner Cable, according to
company executives. Several years ago, News Corp. considered luring
Bewkes to become its No. 3 executive.</TE>
<TE>   In an internal company memo distributed Thursday, Parsons praised
Bewkes' performance at HBO, where he boosted its compound annual cash
flow by 16%. Parsons also acknowledged HBO's unprecedented number of
Emmys and Golden Globes in recent years. The channel's financial
performance was lumped together with the company's other cable
networks and the WB networks.</TE>
<TE>   In the memo, Parsons also pointed out that Logan improved compound
annual cash flow by 14% since taking charge of the publishing group
and posted 41 consecutive quarters of year-over-year earnings growth.
"When Don became Time Inc. CEO in 1994, we published nearly two dozen
magazines. Today, Time Inc. publishes 140 regular titles, with
approximately 300 million readers and commands a 25% share of
domestic magazine advertising," Parsons said in the memo.</TE>
<TE>   At HBO, Bewkes will be succeeded as chairman and chief executive
by Chris Albrecht, formerly president of HBO original programming.
Albrecht is credited with bringing to air a string of hit original
series, including Emmy-winning "The Sopranos," "Sex and the City" and
"Six Feet Under."</TE>
<TE>   Moving up to replace Logan at Time Inc. is Ann Moore, currently an
executive vice president.</TE>
<TE>   Moore has spent almost her entire career at Time Inc. and has been
an architect of People magazine's success in spinning off such
publishing successes as Teen People, People en Espanol and In Style.</TE>

<HD>Competing Agendas at Vivendi</HD>
<DH>Media: Americans want to be free of company's money woes;
French want firm to survive.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Vivendi Universal's top American executives are flying to Paris for
their first face-to-face meetings Monday with the ailing
corporation's new chairman, who will help determine the future of
some of Hollywood's premiere entertainment companies.</LD>
<LD>   Although the trip is being billed as a series of formal
presentations and informal gatherings to bring Chairman Jean-Rene
Fourtou up to speed on Universal's studio, theme park and music
company, the various individuals sitting around the table have
dramatically different agendas. The Americans want to be freed from
the corporation's financial quagmire, and the French want to keep the
company afloat.</LD>
<LD>   The Monday meetings are part of Fourtou's broad effort to shape a
new strategy for Vivendi, which has amassed billions of dollars in
debt, leading to a plunging stock price and the ouster of its
previous chief executive, Jean-Marie Messier. The company's confusing
identity--half European water and sewer utility and half
international media conglomerate--has bewildered investors here and
abroad.</LD>
<TE>   "This company is a collection of disparate assets that you cannot
say belong together in a cohesive strategy," one person close to the
board said.</TE>
<TE>   Although U.S. executives are not expected to advocate a specific
course of action, some privately have said they favor a scenario in
which Universal's entertainment properties would be severed from
Vivendi control and spun off as a separate company.</TE>
<TE>   But the most powerful of those executives, Vivendi Universal
Entertainment Chairman Barry Diller, has yet to tip his hand. Diller
oversees the company's movie, television and theme park operations.
Said one colleague: "Barry's being coy."</TE>
<TE>   Preparing to meet with his new boss, Diller has held a series of
meetings over the last two weeks during which he has pressed his
executives to think about the future and give him their wish lists,
concrete proposals to champion with the French, according to sources
at the companies.</TE>
<TE>   Accompanying Diller in Paris will be the president of Universal
Studios, Ron Meyer, and the chairman of Universal's music division,
Doug Morris.</TE>
<TE>   Throughout Hollywood, there has been speculation that Diller is
laying the groundwork to buy Universal or, at the minimum, to head a
newly autonomous company. Sources close to Diller, however, have said
that the longtime entertainment executive has expressed no interest
in buying or controlling Universal.</TE>
<TE>   When he sold his USA Networks to Vivendi late last year for $10.4
billion, Diller agreed to become chairman of Vivendi's non-music U.S.
entertainment assets, an unpaid position with no contracted time
frame. He did receive a lump sum payment of $275 million.</TE>
<TE>   Separately, Diller kept control of USA Network's e-commerce
business, USA Interactive, and has been splitting his time between
that venture and Universal.</TE>
<TE>   USAI, considered the company with the greater growth potential
because of expanding Internet commerce, has been dominating Diller's
time.</TE>
<TE>   Fourtou, since replacing Messier two weeks ago, has been spending
most of his time grappling with the company's immediate financial
crisis, a cash shortfall hastened by concerns over the company's
$30-billion debt. To buy time, Fourtou secured a $1-billion loan so
he could address the company's larger strategic issues.</TE>
<TE>   "They do not have the luxury of time," J.P. Morgan Securities
analyst Mark Harrington said. "Without question, there's a risk that
the company's longer-term strategy could be compromised by this
overriding priority to improve its liquidity."</TE>
<TE>   With the stock price falling 70% this year, the Vivendi board of
directors is unified in the need to regain shareholder confidence but
is in no rush to dismantle the company, sources close to the board
said.</TE>
<TE>   The directors plan to take at least the next month to gain a
better understanding of the various assets and weigh their options.</TE>
<TE>   During that time, however, that unanimity will be tested should
there be a clash between the company's French identity and the need
to rescue the stock price.</TE>
<TE>   "At the end of the day, the board that chooses pride over
shareholder value is making an error and taking a risk," the source
said.</TE>
<TE>   J.P. Morgan estimates that, in the worst-case scenario, Vivendi
needs to raise at least $8 billion from asset sales over the next 18
months. Vivendi will be forced to make a major asset sale in the next
few months to meet a $1.8-billion funding gap this year. That gap
will widen to $6.3 billion by next year.</TE>
<TE>   Further evidence of widening shareholder disillusionment came
Thursday when investment group Rosenbaum Partners filed a lawsuit on
behalf of shareholders in federal court in New York, accusing the
company of hiding its cash crisis. Vivendi had no comment.</TE>
<TE>   Joining the U.S. executives and Fourtou at Vivendi's headquarters
next to the Arc de Triomphe will be two key players in the ouster of
Messier. One is Claude Bebear, chairman of France's largest insurance
company, Axa, and Fourtou's closest advisor. The other is Edgar
Bronfman Jr., who represents the interests of the Bronfman family,
the largest individual holder of Vivendi stock and the previous owner
of Universal Studios.</TE>

<HD>For Warner Bros., a Return to Autonomy</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAMES BATES and CLAUDIA ELLER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>So much for synergy.</LD>
<LD>   For Warner Bros., the appointment of HBO chief Jeffrey Bewkes to
oversee AOL Time Warner's entertainment units appears to signal a
return to the days when the studio operated from its Burbank lot as
an autonomous unit so long as it churned out hit films and TV shows.</LD>
<LD>   That approach differed markedly from the philosophy of the last 18
months since the America Online and Time Warner merger. Under
now-departed AOL Time Warner Chief Operating Officer Robert W.
Pittman, numerous "synergies" linking entertainment and Internet
divisions were forced on skeptical division heads. All AOL Time
Warner units were strong-armed into spending additional advertising
dollars at America Online that executives believed were unnecessary.</LD>
<TE>   The new, broader strategy set by AOL Time Warner Chief Executive
Richard D. Parsons is reminiscent of the management style Warner
Bros. enjoyed under the late Time Warner Chairman Steve Ross. In
pre-merger days, division heads were encouraged to run their own
businesses and find ways to link with other units when it made sense,
a philosophy Bewkes is expected to bring to the company.</TE>
<TE>   "We have a shared philosophy, which is to run the divisions as
best as you can and let the cooperation rise organically. It only
works when it's organic. When it's mandated, it doesn't work at all,"
said Warner Bros. Chairman Barry Meyer.</TE>
<TE>   But Warner Bros. executives said the studio is not likely to
return to the freewheeling Ross style because the company is so much
bigger. In Ross' day, units were so independent it was like "each
division had a moat around it," one company source said. Meyer
agreed, saying, "It would be very hard in today's world to run a
kibbutz of divisions running totally independently."</TE>
<TE>   At Warner Music, insiders also responded favorably to Bewkes'
appointment, saying it would mean more autonomy for the division,
which has picked up market share amid declining worldwide music
sales. But some speculated that one of Bewkes' mandates from
Parsons--to combat digital piracy across AOL Time Warner--means he
will begin weighing in on strategic decisions in the music division.</TE>
<TE>   A personable, popular executive within the company, Bewkes enjoys
close ties to Warner Bros. Bewkes helped heal strained relations
between HBO and the studio, which deteriorated when former HBO chief
Michael Fuchs helped bankroll the now-defunct rival movie distributor
Savoy Pictures.</TE>
<TE>   Meyer, a 30-year Warner Bros. veteran, was elated at the
appointment of Bewkes, whom he has known for more than 20 years.
Bewkes also comes from the Time Warner camp that has been at odds
with the America Online faction Pittman led. Time Warner executives
believe that their company and its stock price have been dragged down
by AOL's performance, and that the two companies were combined when
AOL was at the peak of the Internet hype.</TE>
<TE>   For Bewkes, Warner Bros. will be one of the crown jewels in his
group, which scored big with its "Harry Potter" franchise and this
summer's hit "Scooby-Doo."</TE>
<TE>   If the Time Warner faction wasn't encouraged enough that the
management shifts have given it the upper hand with AOL, Warner Bros.
insiders read between the lines of Thursday's news release. Since the
merger, AOL Time Warner's boilerplate description was "the world's
first Internet-powered media and communications company." In
Thursday's announcement, it was "the world's leading media and
entertainment company."</TE>

<HD>Ghost of Russia's K-19 Haunts Us</HD>
<DH>It's one of many rusting subs that must be destroyed.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CRISTINA CHUEN</AU>
<BD>Cristina Chuen is a research associate at the Center
for Nonproliferation Studies of the Monterey Institute of
International Affairs.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The blockbuster starring Harrison Ford and Liam Neeson that is
opening today, "K-19: the Widowmaker," chronicles the terrifying
early history of the Soviet Union's first nuclear submarine, the
K-19.</LD>
<LD>   In July 1961, deep under the ice of the North Atlantic, the
submarine's coolant system failed, dangerously overheating its
nuclear reactor. Several sailors entered the reactor compartment to
improvise a cooling system. They died soon afterward from radiation
poisoning. Twenty-one men eventually perished.</LD>
<LD>   Amazingly, the K-19 is still with us, one of 190 decommissioned
Soviet nuclear-powered submarines rusting at their piers. As many as
100 of them still have nuclear fuel on board, risking a reactor
incident or diversion of material for a terrorist radiation weapon or
"dirty bomb."</LD>
<TE>   The United States, through the U.S. Cooperative Threat Reduction
program, has already spent more than $300 million dismantling
ballistic-missile submarines and is planning to scrap 41 of these by
2007.</TE>
<TE>   However, threat reduction legislation forbids funding work on
nonstrategic nuclear-powered submarines. Russia does not have the
money to scrap these 149 vessels, which pose proliferation as well as
environmental risks.</TE>
<TE>   Although not ballistic-missile platforms, attack submarines are
nuclear-capable. They can launch land-attack cruise missiles with a
range of almost 2,000 miles and carrying nuclear warheads 13 times
more destructive than the bomb dropped on Hiroshima.</TE>
<TE>   Since 1991, Russia has not armed its general-purpose submarines
with nuclear weapons and has promised not to do so. However, the
capability remains and should be eliminated while we have the
opportunity.</TE>
<TE>   Newer decommissioned boats could be recommissioned and even sold
abroad. The Krasnoyarsk, an Oscar II submarine like the ill-fated
Kursk, was launched in 1986 and has been laid up since 1995. Its crew
is begging for funds to refurbish the boat.</TE>
<TE>   As many as a dozen submarines could be recommissioned if the
Russian economy continues to turn around. If money becomes scarce,
that is all the more incentive for Russia to sell or lease boats to
foreign countries.</TE>
<TE>   Already, Russia is in talks with India over the leasing of two
attack submarines.</TE>
<TE>   Russia's nuclear submarines also provide a tempting terrorist
target. In 1998, a disgruntled sailor overpowered a guard and
barricaded himself in the torpedo compartment of a Northern Fleet
Akula-class submarine. He died attempting to set a fire.</TE>
<TE>   A fire beneath the torpedoes would have led to the explosion of
all of the submarine's ammunition, which would have destroyed the
submarine, neighboring nuclear submarines and the port town of
Gadzhiyevo, not to mention the greater consequences of destroying the
nuclear reactors.</TE>
<TE>   Terrorists too have toyed with the idea of taking over a Russian
submarine: In February, the Russian military discovered plans to
hijack a Russian nuclear submarine. The plan, prepared by Islam
Khasukhanov, chief of staff of the Chechen armed forces and a former
deputy commander of a Soviet nuclear submarine, called for seven
people of Slavic origin to board a submarine and place explosives in
the torpedo, battery and reactor compartments as well as near the
warhead of one of the missiles.</TE>
<TE>   Decommissioned submarines also make tempting targets, and access
is relatively easy. Guards have often been caught supplementing their
meager incomes of about $35 a month by stealing and selling metal
from the submarines they are supposed to guard, or taking bribes to
look the other way as others steal from the vessels.</TE>
<TE>   What can we do? It costs about $7 million to defuel and dismantle
an attack submarine, no small sum. But the financial and human cost
of cleaning up after a radiation incident would be immeasurable.</TE>
<TE>   European nations and Japan have suggested that they are willing to
help foot this bill but are waiting for the U.S. to lead the way.
While we have done a lot already, we should direct a new effort to
eliminate these boats while we have the chance.</TE>
<TE>   The story of the K-19 is one of heroes willing to subject
themselves to radiation to prevent its spread to the rest of us.
Let's prevent another tragedy so more men will not have to follow in
their footsteps.</TE>

<HD>Despite Skeptics and Critics, Cryonics May Be a Cool Way to
Go</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BART KOSKO</AU>
<BD>Bart Kosko, a professor of electrical engineering at
USC and author of "Heaven in a Chip" (Random House, 2000), is on the
science advisory board of the nonprofit Alcor cryonics corporation.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Go ahead and laugh at cryonics. Denounce those who would suspend the
late Ted Williams in liquid nitrogen in the hope that future science
will somehow resurrect him, one cell at a time.</LD>
<LD>   You're in good company: Church groups uniformly oppose cryonics.
British Columbia outlaws it. The $25-billion funeral industry opposes
cryonics even more vigorously than it opposed cremation before the
1960s. It buries about 6,000 people every day in expensive coffins,
while only a thousand or so folks have signed up for cryonics and
only about 100 actually lie in cryo-suspension.</LD>
<LD>   Bioethicists cringe at cryonics and call it repugnant and other
names. Many physicians and scientists dismiss cryonics as a futile
effort to resurrect the cow from the hamburger, even though most have
no expertise in computer-chip or molecular engineering. The by-laws
of the Society of Cryobiology even "refuse membership to applicants
who promote any practice or application of freezing deceased persons
in the anticipation of their reanimation." (Cryobiology is the study
of the effects of low temperatures on organisms.)</LD>
<TE>   No one can predict the course of technology decades into the
future. Yet that is just what the naysayers purport to do. They argue
in essence that science will never resurrect the frozen dead because
no one knows how to do it today. Absence of evidence now, however, is
not evidence of future absence. Time all but stops for tissue
suspended at minus-320 degrees Fahrenheit. Cryonics "patients" can
wait centuries if they have to.</TE>
<TE>   There is now only a small probability that science will work the
needed miracle of resurrecting frozen brains and other tissue. Yet
the future benefit would be an awesome increase in lifespan in a
brave new world. The current cost of this gamble is substantial but
not prohibitive--about the cost of a major medical procedure.</TE>
<TE>   Is it worth it? Cryonicists think so, if only as a crude way to
back up one's synapses until chip and neural-network technology makes
some great leaps forward.</TE>
<TE>   But let's be frank. Most attacks on cryonics don't come from
reasoned scientific judgment. The real animus against cryonics comes
from religion and its monopoly on the concept of an afterlife or
heaven.</TE>
<TE>   Cryonics challenges this ancient monopoly head-on and does so
unflinchingly in the name of technology and materialism. It offers a
fighting chance to achieve a digital paradise of nano-engineered
brain synapses and computer uploads for the price of a life insurance
policy. Digital heaven-in-a-chip by way of cryonics may be only a
rough engineering approximation of what many would like, but at least
it does not contravene any physical law. It also has on its side
Moore's Law, which says computer chip densities double every two
years or so.</TE>
<TE>   Religion offers instead a cynical swap of present and future
value: Pay and believe now and collect your rewards forever after you
die--even though there is no evidence that anyone has ever cashed in
this eternal free lunch.</TE>
<TE>   Cryonics further exposes the "moral hazard" at the heart of
religious belief in an afterlife. Belief in heaven acts as cheap
insurance against the finality of death. The easy promise of an
afterlife undercuts the resolve to face death squarely and to take
steps to combat death, just as owning fire insurance can make one
lazy about making adequate fire precautions. It is far easier to just
make the leap of faith--especially if almost everyone else leaps with
you. This argument suggests that the nearly universal belief in a
religious afterlife may have slowed the technological assault on
death and disease by decades, if not centuries.</TE>
<TE>   Cryonics is ultimately a vast social experiment. Today, about a
thousand have signed up for the experimental group. Everyone else, by
default, is in the control group. So go ahead and laugh while the
heartbeats last.</TE>
<TE>   In a century or so we'll let you know how it turns out.</TE>

<KH>STANDING UP TO STREET GANGS</KH>
<HD>From Pilgrimage to Protest</HD>

<LD>The 300 walkers who braved the baking heat of the northeast San
Fernando Valley last week to take a stand against gang violence
evoked both a pilgrimage and a protest march. Pilgrims appeal for a
miracle. Protesters demand social change. Halting gang violence may
well require both.</LD>
<LD>   The marchers carried seven coffins, each representing a life lost
in their corner of the Valley in May alone. One stood for a Panorama
City 3-year-old who, hit by cross fire, died in his father's arms.
The coffins were meant to make real otherwise disembodied statistics
that show gang killings surging citywide. In the first six months of
2002, gangbangers accounted for more than half the city's 341
homicides.</LD>
<LD>   The increase comes after a drop in homicides in the 1990s that
crime researchers attribute to a booming economy, tougher prison
sentences and the waning of the crack epidemic. Experts speculate
that killings are up again because of the greater number of inmates
who have completed their sentences and are returning to the streets,
the stalled economy and a population bulge of crime-prone
adolescents.</LD>
<TE>   If this cycle of violence seems as intractable as the poverty,
poor schools, lack of jobs and other social ills that fuel gangs,
that hasn't stopped the marchers, not in Pacoima. Not in
South-Central Los Angeles either, where 40 moms, all of whom had
buried sons or daughters, marched on Mother's Day. And not in Boyle
Heights, where dozens of men, women and children walk every Friday
evening to reclaim their streets.</TE>
<TE>   Pilgrims on the medieval road to Santiago, Spain, walked to save
themselves or loved ones from disease. In modern times, Martin Luther
King Jr. and Cesar Chavez also called their marches pilgrimages. They
walked--from Selma, Ala., to Montgomery, from Delano, Calif., to
Sacramento--to demand an end to racism, to spotlight the plight of
migrant workers.</TE>
<TE>   In her book "Wanderlust: A History of Walking," social critic
Rebecca Solnit wrote of King's 1965 Selma-to-Montgomery march: "They
have found in this walk a way to make their history rather than
suffer it, to measure their strength and test their freedom." From
AIDS walkathons to the Million Mom March in Washington for gun
control, walkers still follow the path of pilgrimage and protest.</TE>
<TE>   Save for fitness buffs, the stereotypical Angeleno walks nowhere.
That's not true in the city's poorer areas. People walk to bus stops
and markets. And ordinary people walk, as they did last week, to
proclaim their right to safely stroll their own neighborhoods.</TE>

<LD>Terrorist attacks in Jerusalem last month killed 26 Israelis and sent
the army back into the occupied territories, where it kept
Palestinians under virtual house arrest. The soldiers and tanks
enforced a relative peace for a few weeks, but an armed attack in a
settlement in the occupied West Bank and suicide bombers in Tel Aviv
have shattered the tense calm. The terrorism proves again the
impossibility of preventing every attack. It underlines the need for
a believable path toward a long-term political settlement.</LD>
<LD>   On Tuesday, Palestinian gunmen attacked a bus outside the West
Bank enclave of Emmanuel, home to devoutly observant Jews. The armor
plating installed on buses there after a similar attack outside
Emmanuel last December provided little protection. The terrorists
were able to kill eight settlers by throwing grenades into the
vehicle and firing through tiny windows and the unarmored roof. On
Wednesday, a double suicide bombing in Tel Aviv killed the bombers
and three others.</LD>
<LD>   Israel's defense minister insists that the attacks point up the
need for the army to extend its West Bank stay, now nearly four weeks
long. The army says it has already prevented many attacks, but
military analysts say forces are stretched too thin to stop attacks,
chase militants and guard about 200,000 settlers in the occupied
territories.</LD>
<TE>   The last four weeks also have deepened the misery of Palestinians
who view Israelis as usurpers of their land. About 800,000
Palestinians have lived under nearly around-the-clock curfews,
allowed to leave their homes only for several hours every few days to
buy supplies. That increases the number of Palestinians who applaud
the suicide bombers. Yasser Arafat's Palestinian Authority again
issued ritual denunciations of the bombings but again was unable or
unwilling to stop them.</TE>
<TE>   The Bush administration has vowed to have nothing to do with
Arafat and has demanded new Palestinian leadership. However,
Secretary of State Colin L. Powell said this week he would be "more
than willing to consider" a ceremonial presidential role for Arafat.
A Palestinian Authority aide said Arafat was weighing the appointment
of a prime minister to handle the day-to-day affairs of the
government after elections scheduled for January. U.S. allies
continue to insist that it's up to the Palestinians, not Washington,
to choose Palestinian leaders.</TE>
<TE>   Before Arab foreign ministers met with President Bush on Thursday,
Egypt's top diplomat said Washington needed to demand more of Israel
and not just keep hammering the Palestinian Authority. Bush's June 24
speech called for security for Israel and a change in Palestinian
leadership. What it did not offer was a road map to the Palestinian
state that the administration said it supported.</TE>
<TE>   Israel does need to be secure and free from terror. But without a
more specific outline of their future, Palestinians will continue to
believe they are being offered pie in the sky, not a realistic vision
for a state of their own.</TE>

<HD>Russia's Culture of Racism</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Russia has just adopted a new legal code that enshrines the
principles of habeas corpus and the presumption of innocence. Capital
has stopped fleeing the country and investment has begun to trickle
in. Ford Motor Co. recently opened what is believed to be Russia's
first foreign-owned large industrial facility.</LD>
<LD>   Yet as Russia finds its economic footing, a problem of a different
sort is growing. When Leonna Griffin, an American student in Russia,
"comes in contact with a [Russian] guy," she either gets "hit on or
spit on," she says. Griffin is African American, and her situation is
indicative of what many foreign students, Chechens, Jews, even
foreign embassy employees face.</LD>
<LD>   Since May 2000, beatings by racist thugs have sent 104 foreigners
to hospitals. There are nonviolent humiliations as well. One African
graduate student and teacher was lecturing when his students raised a
large, hand-painted swastika. Many young neo-Nazis sport swastikas
and have made Jews a target of attacks. That's especially pernicious
in light of the millions of Russian Slavs slaughtered at the hands of
the Nazis.</LD>
<TE>   Things have gotten so bad that most foreign ambassadors in Moscow
joined in a protest to the Russian foreign minister. Some diplomats
are considering leaving the country.</TE>
<TE>   President Vladimir V. Putin and the lower house of parliament, the
Duma, recently passed an anti-extremist law, which legislators
contend will crack down on racist skinhead gangs. But there are
already laws to combat the skinheads. They just aren't enforced. The
new law, critics of the Kremlin fear, will be more useful as a tool
for the government to shut down political dissent.</TE>
<TE>   As Andrei Zdravomyslev, a representative of the Moscow-based
Institute of Social and National Issues, said, "Tolerance and
cooperation need to be learned.... " Zdravomyslev and other experts
favor a countrywide, anti-racist educational campaign.</TE>
<TE>   Russia can start by changing what it teaches its schoolchildren.
If Putin is really serious about pulling up the growing weed of
racism, he must cultivate tolerance in Russia's public schools.</TE>
<TE>   Instead of emphasizing past military glories to fuel Russian
nationalism, which only encourages the extremism, state-approved
textbooks should stress acceptance of the many ethnic groups that
inhabit the world's largest country.</TE>
<TE>   Reforming cultural norms, though it will take longer, will have a
more enduring effect than passing redundant laws.</TE>

<HD>More Than Tradition Feeds the Beef Industry</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>I read "Last Roundup at Irvine Ranch Ends 2 Centuries of Tradition"
(July 15) with a growing sorrow. In man's insatiable hunger for red
meat there is an insensitivity that is sadder than the "lone bellow
echo[ing] from one cow pen like a half-strangled bugler playing
taps." Your story treats the growing extinction of the cowboy with a
reverence that overlooks its insensitive treatment of the cattle they
herd to slaughter.</LD>
<LD>   It comments offhandedly about cows and their calves being rounded
up, with the calves "running after their mothers and bawling once
they realize they won't be allowed to stop and suckle." Then they are
separated: "half a dozen nervous calves tumbling over each other up
the ramp," while the wrangler croons a ditty and another explains,
"This is our favorite haul ... " as he pushes the animals in with a
long battery-charged prod.</LD>
<LD>   I would be relieved if this, indeed, were an end to two centuries
of tradition with the demise of the Irvine Ranch. It isn't. For what
the cowboy did to support himself and his family, the meat industry
does to feed greed, the bottom line and the stockholder.</LD>
<TE>   This results in even greater insensitivity and inexcusably more
abusive treatment to these harmless creatures ... their fear, pain
and bellowing ending up on the plates of America.</TE>

<HD>Hogwash! to IRA's Apology for Violence</HD>
<DH></DH>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Re "IRA Offers a Sweeping Apology," July 17: The Irish Republican
Army's "sweeping apology offer" is hypocritical, ludicrous and
incongruous to say the least. It states that the IRA apologizes for
killing and injuring civilians during its long campaign of violence
against British rule in Northern Ireland. Hogwash!</LD>
<LD>   I lived in London from 1971 to 1976, during which time the IRA
indiscriminately placed bombs in purely civilian locations
(restaurants, hotels) in London, and I myself, an American, narrowly
missed (by 10 minutes) being killed or injured. It got so bad that
whenever we spotted a package in an alley, etc., we were advised to
avoid the location by a wide margin.</LD>
<LD>   It is interesting that the State Department never branded the IRA
a terrorist group but Hamas and other groups are rightfully so
designated. It is sadly obvious that the difference is influence and
support in Washington.</LD>

<LD>Landlords will always find a way around whatever law there is,
particularly if the tenants are ignorant of their rights ("Council
Halts Evictions, Will Tighten Law," July 17). If the building isn't
old enough to be protected by rent control, the landlord just raises
the rent through the roof ($600 a month in our case) so that the
tenant has no choice but to leave. Families trade buildings among
themselves so as to have new owners when it's convenient to raise
rents.</LD>

<HD>Visitors Often Abuse Malibu's Most Accessible Public
Beaches</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Steve Lopez seems to always conveniently leave out of his beach
access columns that there is a beautiful stretch of sandy beach
available to everyone, with ample parking; it is called Zuma ("A
Concerted Effort to Free Malibu Beaches for the Rest of Us," July
17). There are also the Corral Canyon, Topanga and always-scenic Leo
Carrillo beaches. Malibu Beach is great for everyone, and if one
wanted to, one could walk at low tide for miles and park oneself on
any patch of sand below the mean high-tide line.</LD>
<LD>   I wonder if Lopez even knows what part of the Pacific Coast
Highway he is talking about. It is very dangerous to cross the street
by David Geffen's home, and there is little parking available. Does
he really want moms and their kids in tow trying to cross a deadly
highway with beach chairs, coolers and umbrellas?</LD>
<LD>   While I can't speak for Geffen, I can say that it is people who do
not live in Malibu who leave their filthy diapers, empty bottles,
fast-food wrappers and used condoms all over the beaches. It is
usually out-of-towners who make insane illegal U-turns or come to a
dead stop in the middle of PCH to find a parking spot.</LD>
<TE>   Yes, I live in Malibu, but I do not live on the beach, and my
husband works hard for us to just scrape it together to live here.
But may I suggest to Lopez: Instead of trying to get a tiny public
beach access path in a dangerous area, why don't you instead write
about how people can be more conscious of the environment and others'
lives when they visit Malibu? Then bring your beach towel and chair
down to Zuma to watch the dolphins and surfers; it is really quite
lovely.</TE>

<TE>   Re Malibu beaches: What's lacking is not public access but easy
public access, and it is this lack of easy public access that makes
these beaches desirable. Every beach in Malibu is accessible by any
member of the public willing to walk, swim, row or sail for a short
distance. Some people prefer a different beach experience, quieter
and with fewer people around. We can get that experience by walking
half a mile.</TE>
<TE>   In Los Angeles, easy public access brings crowds of people, and
the only thing that's different about Carbon Beach in Malibu is the
lack of crowds.</TE>
<TE>   Broad Beach is a perfect example of how providing easy public
access diminishes the beach-going experience for everyone. There are
several narrow public access ways provided along this beach. The
residents have surveyed and posted the mean high-tide mark and hired
private guards to patrol the beach on motorized vehicles to protect
their legitimate property rights. A pleasant beach day has been
transformed into a confrontational experience by well-meaning
advocates of easy public access.</TE>
<TE>   Access for All should devote its energies to improving the miles
of existing beaches that provide easy public access. Places like
Carbon Beach should be left alone so that those of us who are willing
to walk a bit can have a different kind of beach experience.</TE>

wrappers, bottles, cans, dog doo-doo, etc. Leave it as beautiful and
pristine as you found it.</TE>

<HD>Lindh Supported a Repressive Regime</HD>
<DH></DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Frank Lindh, the father of American Talib John Walker Lindh, dares to
compare his son to Nelson Mandela ("Lindh Pleads Guilty, Agrees to
Aid Inquiry," July 16). After his son pleaded guilty to fighting for
the Taliban, Lindh senior was quoted as saying, "I told John ... that
Nelson Mandela served 27 years in prison. He's a good man, like
John."</LD>
<LD>   I'm personally offended by this ludicrous comparison. Mandela went
to prison for opposing a regime that robbed him, and all black South
Africans, of their basic human rights. John Lindh willingly left his
home to fight for a regime that robbed all women of their basic human
rights. The Taliban treated women even more harshly than the South
African government treated blacks under apartheid. To invoke the name
of Mandela in support of a man who actively fought to create a nation
in which women were essentially slaves is the height of absurdity.</LD>
<LD>   By sweeping the Taliban's treatment of women under the carpet, the
media allowed the Lindh family to perpetuate the myth that as long as
their son knew nothing of 9/11 he did nothing wrong by fighting for
the Taliban.</LD>
<TE>   David Harvey</TE>

<TE>   Lindh isn't the first American to join another country's civil
war. Nearly 3,000 U.S. volunteers (mostly communists) fought against
Franco's fascists in the Spanish Civil War. America's isolationist
tendencies avoid involving our commissioned soldiers in conflicts
that don't directly apply to us (regional example: India versus
Pakistan). But after one side of the Taliban versus Northern Alliance
conflict became a clear enemy, we got a big wake-up call. At least
one American was already involved.</TE>
<TE>   So what do we do when citizens want to fight in non-American
battles? After Monday's messy settlement, it's time for a better
policy.</TE>
<TE>   Adam J. Rose</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   On the same day that it's assumed that Lindh will serve less than
his 20-year prison term because of good behavior, it's reported that
Marjorie Knoller, the killer-dog lady of San Francisco, will be free
in a mere 14 months, thanks to time served and good behavior. People
are sentenced and sent to jail because of their evil deeds.
Considering that they are then living under armed guard 24 hours a
day, their so-called good behavior is hardly evidence of an epiphany.
Instead, I would suggest that felons serve their full terms, and if
they are stupid enough to misbehave while incarcerated, they should
have additional time tacked on for bad behavior.</TE>

<HD>History Is Obliterated When L.A. Redevelops</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The ongoing destruction of historic neighborhoods to make way for
unused plazas is one of the saddest chapters of L.A. history ("One
Man's Urgent Struggle to Keep L.A. From Demolishing Its Past," July
15). Our civic history has been so glossed over that few people
realize the extent of what's been lost. For example, history books
usually state that Old Chinatown was obliterated when Union Station
was built in the 1930s. This is mostly true, yet there was still a
significant remnant of Old Chinatown tucked between the east side of
the Old Plaza and Union Station until the 1950s.</LD>
<LD>   This included the historic Lugo Adobe, which made the Old Plaza a
real plaza that was enclosed on all four sides. It also included
Ferguson Alley, which ran between the plaza and Union Station and
featured a large Buddhist temple. It was one of the oldest streets in
the city. Now all of that is gone, replaced in part by a small park
that goes unused except for the occasional derelict.</LD>

<LD>Chad Hanson is right on (Commentary, July 15). For at least the last
60 years the U.S. Forest Service has been charged with administering
a form of corporate welfare that has the unfortunate side effect of
reducing the breadth, depth and diversity of our national forests. It
sells logging rights at a loss; i.e., after the surveying, mapping
and other overhead expenses, and especially after the construction of
logging roads, we the taxpayers are losing money (more than $1
billion in 2000). Worse, we are losing our forests. With regard to
fire-prevention logging, the plain truth is that small trees and
brush burn best, and the logging companies want large trees. The
unintended consequence is that logging operations increase the fuel
supply. To deny these facts is to guarantee more of the same.</LD>

<HD>Foster Children's Care Inadequate, Suit Says</HD>
<DH>Courts: L.A. County and the state are accused of breaking
U.S. law by failing to offer proper services. Some officials concede
problems.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>EVELYN LARRUBIA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The ACLU and five public interest law firms sued Los Angeles County
and the state Thursday, claiming the governments for years have
knowingly failed to provide mental health services for foster
children in the county in violation of federal laws.</LD>
<LD>   States that participate in the federal Medicaid program are
required to provide certain services to children, but Los Angeles
County and California have failed to follow those rules, the suit
says. Federal and state money would cover almost all the costs
involved, the plaintiffs said, because the vast majority of foster
children are poor and thus qualify for Medi-Cal, the state version of
Medicaid.</LD>
<LD>   Some county officials acknowledged that they have made slow
progress in their efforts to provide mental health services to foster
children outside of psychiatric hospitals and confined group homes.
Although the county has launched some pilot programs, they reach only
a few hundred children; the county's child welfare system serves
about 50,000 young people overall.</LD>
<TE>   "They are not getting sufficient mental health services. And the
reason is because there isn't a systemic approach" to assessing
children's mental health needs when they are first identified as
victims of abuse or neglect, said Marv Southard, director of the
county Department of Mental Health. "The average kid would get mental
health services not as a preventative measure but only when they
started having problems."</TE>
<TE>   Chief Administrative Officer David Janssen said the county has
been targeting its efforts on the most seriously disturbed children
in its foster care system with a program called Wraparound.</TE>
<TE>   "The only thing that really matters is what we're doing now," he
said. So far, 32 children have completed the Wraparound program. It
recently was expanded to create space for 110 children, with plans to
double that number by December. A similar, but less intensive,
program serves almost 400 other children, he said.</TE>
<TE>   The lawsuit cites the cases of five foster children, some of whom
suffered from other disabilities. In each instance, lawyers for the
children allege, the youngsters never received proper assessments or
services and were moved around among dozens of homes and hospitals.
One child, the lawsuit states, was moved 37 times in 10 years.</TE>
<TE>   A 16-year-old, who was identified by a pseudonym, entered foster
care after sexual abuse by an uncle and her stepfather. After she was
moved between two foster homes, was hospitalized twice and lived for
a month in the county emergency shelter, the girl's social worker
characterized her behavioral problems as "hormones acting up,"
according to the lawsuit.</TE>
<TE>   "This is child neglect on the part of the county," Mark Rosenbaum,
legal director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Southern
California, said at news conference.</TE>
<TE>   Standing behind him was a former foster youth who echoed the
lawsuit's allegations. Robert Kaiffie, 20, said he had been in the
foster care system for as long as he can remember, moved from place
to place, including psychiatric hospitals, and from medication to
medication to control his behavior. None of it was tailored to his
needs or helped him, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "All this movement taught me to shut down, to close myself off, to
be emotionally withdrawn," he said, reading from a prepared
statement. "I don't know what child wouldn't react this way."</TE>
<TE>   Rosenbaum said the county relies on restrictive group homes--such
as the MacLaren Children's Center in El Monte--for children with
severe emotional and behavioral problems despite agreement among
children's mental health experts that those settings do more harm
than good. Upfront, intensive services are not only more successful,
but also cheaper, he said.</TE>
<TE>   A recent grand jury report estimated that MacLaren spends about
$270,000 per child per year.</TE>
<TE>   "Perhaps what makes it most frustrating is that in the year 2002,
we know what these children need," said Lew Hollman, executive
director of the Center for Law in the Public Interest. "They receive
none of those things in the system we have today."</TE>
<TE>   The suit claims that the county has known about problems for
years, citing critical reports from civil grand juries, the Little
Hoover Commission and others.</TE>
<TE>   Supervisor Mike Antonovich said he thinks the advocates raise
legitimate issues and blamed bad management for the slow progress.
"They address a very serious concern," he said. "We need to have an
accelerated program to address the needs of children in our care."</TE>
<TE>   Southard said he and the outgoing director of the county child
welfare department proposed a year ago that the county begin
performing the kinds of early assessments and treatment called for in
the suit. Skeptical service providers have created obstacles, he
said, and the program is still in the planning stages.</TE>

<HD>'Killer Bees' Ruled Out in Dog's Death; 2nd Attack Is

<DH>Insects: Southland specialists grow concerned that an
aggressive hybrid of European and African strains may make up the
stinging swarms.</DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The first laboratory tests of bees involved in a mass stinging
episode in Whittier that killed a small dog and injured two larger
ones Wednesday showed that the bees were of a commonly occurring
European variety, not the more dangerous African variety as had been
feared, an official said Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   John Hurley, Los Angeles County's bee inspector, said that when he
submitted captured bees to lab analysis, they proved to have a
wingspan consistent with a European strain that has long been active
here.</LD>
<LD>   But in Orange County, where three dogs were hospitalized Thursday
after another mass stinging in the city of Orange, a pest control
expert said that more extensive DNA tests would be necessary to
determine whether the bees were a hybrid variety: part African and
part European.</LD>

Laguna Beach, who was called in to handle the Orange County episode,
said that ever since the African strain, often called "killer bees,"
arrived in Southern California within the last few years, there has
been much crossbreeding with the European bees.</TE>
<TE>   There is concern that attacks by the hybrids are more likely to be
deadly to both humans and animals, although even for the African bees
it takes about 1,100 stings to kill a person weighing 150 pounds.</TE>
<TE>   Lisa Aragon, a Whittier resident whose 12-year-old daughter,
Jazmin, was stung once Wednesday, and whose Chihuahua, Ole, died
after receiving scores of stings, said she and her husband, Steve,
had noticed a bee problem in their garage about a month ago.</TE>
<TE>   "We tried to douse the hive with water," she said, "and then we
bought a device that we were told would destroy the hive. But neither
worked. Now, it's cost us $145 to have it taken care of
professionally."</TE>
<TE>   Altogether, Hurley said, about 6,000 bees were involved in the
swarm that killed the Chihuahua, and stung two other dogs belonging
to the Aragons.</TE>
<TE>   In the Orange County attacks Thursday, an estimated 50,000 bees
were involved.</TE>
<TE>   Bob Gordon, owner of Gordon Termite and Pest Control, the
exterminators who were called to the Aragon home, said Thursday that
it is not a good idea for people who aren't trained in handling bees
to try to deal with the hazard.</TE>
<TE>   The bees easily become "aggressively defensive" when they feel
their hives are under attack, Gordon said.</TE>
<TE>   Eric Mussen, an agriculturist at UC Davis, agreed. "Call in the
professionals," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "And the best bet when a stinging episode begins is to put as much
distance between yourself and your pets and the bees as you can by
running away completely or into a closed house or car."</TE>
<TE>   Mussen said that when bees sting, they emit an odor, a bit like
that of bananas, that attracts other bees to the scene in a hurry.</TE>
<TE>   Even though the bees involved in the attacks Wednesday and
Thursday may not have been of the African variety, tests have shown
that they have spread rapidly from Southern California into Central
California since entering the state a year or two ago.</TE>
<TE>   But Hurley said the overall danger can be exaggerated. He cited
national statistics showing that since 1990, when the killer bees
first entered the U.S., only eight people have died from their
stings.</TE>
<TE>   Altogether, he said, an average of 11 people per year have been
killed by all kinds of bee stings in the United States in recent
years. Children and older men have been the most frequent victims.</TE>
<TE>   Outside the Aragon garage Thursday morning, there were still many
bees flying around, although the family said it was assured by
experts that once the queen was killed, the rest of the bees would
soon go away.</TE>

<HD>A Trail of Two Cities</HD>
<DH>Cycling: A new bikeway bypasses busy roads while offering
wider shoulders and ocean vistas from Camarillo to Oxnard.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As cars and trucks thundered past just yards away, Ted Saville peeled
a banana and munched on his midmorning snack as he leisurely pedaled
down Ventura County's newest bike path.</LD>
<LD>   Minutes before he had listened as two dozen fellow cyclists and
politicians touted the 1,000-foot stretch of asphalt--dubbed the
Springville Bike Path--as a safe and direct trail linking Camarillo
and Oxnard bike trails, saving cyclists convoluted twists through
busy city roads.</LD>
<LD>   "This is a small piece of trail but a significant piece of greater
enjoyment of our shared Ventura County," Supervisor Kathy Long said.</LD>
<TE>   The paved bike and pedestrian roadway--near a frontage road south
of the Ventura Freeway and just east of the Del Norte
onramp--includes a bridge over the Revolon Slough flood-control
channel.</TE>
<TE>   Before the path was built, bikers were forced to turn around at
the flood-control channel and search for long detours on high-speed
roads such as Central Avenue, and Sturgis and Pleasant Valley roads.</TE>
<TE>   Cyclists on Thursday praised the county's efforts to provide them
safe passage.</TE>
<TE>   "I came to cheer," retired Silicon Valley CEO Karl Martersteck
said. With tanned and muscled limbs belying his 67 years, the
Thousand Oaks resident said biking helps seniors in his cycling
club--the Old Kranks--exercise and socialize.</TE>
<TE>   Wide paths, he said, encourage recreational bikers.</TE>
<TE>   "There are some narrow roads with not much of a shoulder" that his
group rode between Camarillo and Oxnard, Martersteck said.</TE>
<TE>   Now the group can enjoy its morning rides along farm roads and
take in ocean views in both cities with ease, he added.</TE>
<TE>   The bike path's completion comes after 10 years of effort by
county and Oxnard leaders to link the bike trails across the Oxnard
Plain, Long said.</TE>
<TE>   Long said the path project was proposed by former Supervisor
Maggie Kildee in the early '90s.</TE>
<TE>   The county provided the funding through various state and federal
sources aimed at enhancing air quality, and the city of Oxnard will
maintain the bike path.</TE>
<TE>   The project cost, including land purchase and construction, was
$175,000, said project manager Raj Chikkiah of the county's Public
Works Agency.</TE>
<TE>   The path adds to the dozens of trails and paths that promote
biking as a mode of transportation, Supervisor John Flynn said. It
also encourages intercity travel, he added.</TE>
<TE>   "This is like a marriage between Camarillo and Oxnard, and it's a
great marriage that will last a long time," Flynn said.</TE>

<LD>A car found partially submerged in a river in Tulare County held a
body that may be that of a Pasadena woman missing since July 1,
police said.</LD>
<LD>   On Thursday, Pasadena investigators traveled to the San Joaquin
Valley county, one day after a farm worker found the 1999 Nissan
Maxima in the Tule River. The car belongs to Elizabeth Whiting, 66,
who failed to show up for a family gathering at Shaver Lake in Fresno
County, said Pasadena police spokeswoman Janet Pope.</LD>
<LD>   Whiting, who was prone to blackouts, may have lost control of her
car on California 99, Pope said.</LD>

<HD>Murder Suspect's Lawyer Asks for Dismissal</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TRACY WILSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Criminal charges against murder suspect Bridget Callahan should be
dismissed because prosecutors violated her rights through coercion
and deceit, a defense lawyer argued Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   Attorney Joseph O'Neill asked the judge presiding over Callahan's
preliminary hearing to throw out the case based on "extreme
prosecutorial misconduct."</LD>
<LD>   Recounting what he described as an elaborate tale of deception and
intrigue, O'Neill suggested in court that a prosecutor and
investigator with the Ventura County district attorney's office
manipulated his client with false promises of immunity to obtain
information about a 1998 homicide.</LD>
<TE>   After gaining her trust and cooperation, O'Neill argued,
authorities used Callahan as an informant and then charged her with
murder. He asked that any of her statements about the crime be
suppressed.</TE>
<TE>   But California Deputy Atty. Gen. Michael Katz, whose agency is now
prosecuting the case at the request of the district attorney, argued
that the defense lawyer has no evidence to back up his claims.</TE>
<TE>   Katz urged Ventura County Superior Court Judge Vincent J. O'Neill
Jr. to reject the defense motion.</TE>
<TE>   He asked Judge O'Neill--who is not related to the defense
lawyer--to hold Callahan to answer a charge of murder and related
allegations for her role in the slaying of 17-year-old Nichole
Hendrix of Ventura.</TE>
<TE>   And he argued that Callahan's statements to law enforcement were
voluntary and should be admitted as evidence against her.</TE>
<TE>   "The upshot is she lied repeatedly to law enforcement," Katz
argued. "It wasn't that they were tricking her--she was tricking
them."</TE>
<TE>   Callahan, a 30-year-old Ventura resident, is accused of helping
two skinhead gang members kill Hendrix in a Ventura motel room in
October 1998.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities say Callahan, a gang associate, knew that skinheads
David Ziesmer and Michael Bridgeford intended to kill Hendrix and
kept her from leaving the motel bathroom.</TE>
<TE>   According to Callahan's December 1999 statement to authorities,
she was ordered by Ziesmer to guard Hendrix after Ziesmer became
suspicious that Hendrix had reported them to police for selling
stolen goods.</TE>
<TE>   Callahan told detectives that the men stabbed and beat Hendrix to
death in the motel room bathtub, then packed her body in a trash can
filled with wet cement.</TE>
<TE>   The trash can was later dumped by Callahan and others over the
side of California 33 in the mountains north of Ojai, authorities
said.</TE>
<TE>   According to testimony at the preliminary hearing, Callahan moved
to Arizona after the slaying and was tracked down in October 1999 by
Senior Deputy Dist. Atty. Ron Bamieh and investigator Mark Volpei,
who wanted to talk to her about an unrelated homicide case.</TE>
<TE>   During their conversation, Bamieh testified, Callahan asked about
an eyewitness who had cut a deal with prosecutors. Bamieh said
Callahan indicated that she, too, had information about a slaying.
Two months later, she approached authorities about arranging a deal.</TE>
<TE>   Callahan agreed to provide information about the Hendrix slaying
in exchange for authorities moving her to New Mexico.</TE>
<TE>   According to court testimony, she signed a written agreement
crafted by prosecutors, then provided a detailed account of the
slaying. To the surprise of Bamieh and others, that account directly
implicated her in the killing.</TE>
<TE>   "I never in my wildest dreams thought she was going to say what
she told us," he testified. Callahan's lawyer now contends that
Bamieh and Volpei coerced her during the meeting in Arizona. He
further alleges that law enforcement officials acted unethically by
using her as an informant once they knew she was a suspect--and not a
witness.</TE>
<TE>   "Never once was the idea in mind to proceed in an honorable
fashion," he said. "My client was bamboozled completely."</TE>
<TE>   As for her alleged role in the slaying, Joseph O'Neill argued that
Callahan acted under duress because she feared Ziesmer and
Bridgeford. He said she was culpable only as an accessory after the
fact for helping dispose of Hendrix's body.</TE>
<TE>   Judge O'Neill is expected to rule on Tuesday.</TE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A San Fernando jury convicted a 19-year-old Pacoima man of
second-degree murder Thursday in the fatal shooting of a Kennedy High
School student in September.</LD>
<LD>   Victor Manuel Celis and a teenage passenger drove a rented car
near the Granada Hills high school on Sept. 13 and stopped to ask
Ricky Lloyd and another student about their gang affiliation, Deputy
Dist. Atty. John Morris said.</LD>
<LD>   When Lloyd's friend responded with a rival gang name, Celis'
passenger, Hector Ramirez, ran from the car and followed Lloyd, who
had jumped over a low wall, Morris said.</LD>
<TE>   Ramirez "leaned over the wall and shot [Lloyd] in the head," then
kicked him in the chest a few times as he lay dying about 60 feet
from the campus, the prosecutor said.</TE>
<TE>   Celis and Ramirez flashed gang signs as they were leaving the
crime scene, Morris said.</TE>
<TE>   The 16-year-old victim had been walking to meet his mother about
2:55 p.m. near Woodley Avenue and San Fernando Mission Boulevard when
the attack occurred, police said.</TE>
<TE>   During the seven-day trial, witnesses testified that Celis never
got out of the car and yelled to his passenger, as he got out to
follow Lloyd, "Let's roll!" and "Get into the car!" Morris said.</TE>
<TE>   The jury, which deliberated for more than a day, also convicted
Celis of gang and firearms allegations.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge Warren G. Greene is set to
sentence Celis on Sept. 10. He faces 40 years to life in prison plus
an additional life sentence, Morris said, and will not be eligible
for parole for 54 years.</TE>
<TE>   Ramirez, who was 16 at the time of the shooting, is awaiting trial
as an adult on murder, gang and firearms charges, Morris said.</TE>

<HD>Shortage of Preschools in Southland Grows</HD>
<DH>Access: Centers that boost school readiness are far more
plentiful in Northern California, report finds. It says family
finances suffer.</DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The availability of space in quality child-care centers is shrinking
in some of California's major urban areas, as the growing population
of children outstrips efforts to increase access, according to a new
study by University of California and Stanford researchers.</LD>
<LD>   There also are sweeping geographic disparities, with preschool
slots far more available in San Francisco and other Bay Area counties
than in Los Angeles and Orange counties and the Inland Empire, the
report by the Policy Analysis for California Education research group
found.</LD>
<LD>   Families in affluent parts of Contra Costa County, east of
Oakland, for example, have more than three times the number of
center-based spots per capita than families living in Riverside
County. Los Angeles parents have about half as many preschool spots
per capita available to them as their counterparts in San Francisco.</LD>
<TE>   Such imbalances can have broad implications for Southern
California and other areas that are lagging, researchers said.</TE>
<TE>   "It keeps some women out of the labor force and has the depressing
economic effect of limiting family income," said UC Berkeley
professor Bruce Fuller, who co-wrote the study.</TE>
<TE>   Women who took low- or middle-income jobs would probably have
little left over in take-home pay after subtracting child-care
expenses and taxes, he said.</TE>
<TE>   The report focuses on the availability of preschools and
child-care centers as opposed to home-based child care because
research increasingly finds that center-based care boosts learning
and social development.</TE>
<TE>   "We know that center-based care and quality preschools boost
school readiness, and in this regard have we this great geographical
divide, with kids in the southern part of the state being less
prepared going into kindergarten and first grade than kids in the
north," Fuller said.</TE>
<TE>   Funding vs. Demand</TE>
<TE>   Child-care centers recently became the focus of a proposal in Los
Angeles County to provide universal preschool for all 3- and
4-year-olds whose parents chose to participate. The plan, currently
being studied by a county commission, would use Proposition 10
tobacco tax funds.</TE>
<TE>   Although the statewide number of spaces in centers rose by about
19,000 to 434,000 between 1996 and 2000, little actual growth was
documented after adjusting for the state's rising child population.
Some areas, particularly Orange and Santa Clara counties--recorded
slight per capita declines in the number of spaces available.</TE>
<TE>   "We recognize this is a tremendous problem for us," said Orange
County's child-care coordinator Anne Broussard, who was hired
recently to address many of the issues raised in the study. "We need
more facilities, more trained staff to work in those facilities and
more support of families who can't afford child care costs. It's a
crisis across economic levels."</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, rural areas such as Merced, Humboldt and Sonoma
counties saw strong rates of growth in child-care capacity,
reflecting a concerted effort to build capacity in traditionally
underserved communities, the study said.</TE>
<TE>   In California, which has 3.4 million children under the age of 6,
annual public spending on child care (including state and federal
funds) has almost quadrupled, from $800 million in 1996 to $3.1
billion currently. Yet, tens of thousand of families--100,000 in Los
Angeles County alone--remain on waiting lists, hoping for spots in
preschools and day-care centers to become available for their
children.</TE>
<TE>   Vouchers Are Blamed</TE>
<TE>   In examining why center-based care has been so stagnant despite
rising child-care spending, the study points to the increasing use of
vouchers--direct payments to low-income parents for child-care
costs--which has expanded sevenfold in California since 1996.</TE>
<TE>   The study said parents have used vouchers to pay for informal care
by friends, family members and baby-sitters--in many cases because
there are no affordable centers in their communities. Far less money
has been spent on centers, which are strictly regulated in terms of
staff-to-child ratio.</TE>
<TE>   "Vouchers address the affordability of child care, but for many
parents there is no true choice because they can't find a good center
to send their kids to," said Shelley Waters Booth, a coauthor of the
study and research director for the California Child Care Resource
and Referral Network.</TE>
<TE>   Other factors stunting growth of preschool centers include the
cost of building and expanding facilities (especially in densely
packed urban areas), low staff wages, high teacher turnover and
flagging state reimbursement rates, according to the report.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. Senate next week is scheduled to consider whether to
significantly expand funding for child care, which currently totals
$8 billion nationwide. According to the U.S. Department of Health and
Human Services, present funding levels assist 13% of families
eligible for subsidized child care, which in California would include
a family of four earning $39,000 or less annually.</TE>
<TE>   "In Congress and Sacramento, political leaders have to recognize
that finding affordable child care and preschool are problems that
all working families face," Fuller said.</TE>

<HD>Motorists Plan a Trek of Gratitude</HD>
<DH>Cars: Citroen owners embark today on a cross-country trip
to honor U.S. veterans who helped liberate France from the Nazis.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PATRICIA WARD BIEDERMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>If Citroen ownership is a cult, Robert Chicha is a true believer.</LD>
<LD>   This afternoon, the Sherman Oaks restaurateur will hop into his
1955 Citroen Traction Avant and start out on a monthlong trek from
Los Angeles to New York City with about 90 other lovers of the sturdy
French cars.</LD>
<LD>   Dubbing their trip the "Thank You America Expedition," the drivers
and their families, most of them European, will stop along the way to
honor American veterans of World War II who helped liberate the
French from the Nazis.</LD>
<TE>   Chicha, 55, who was born in North Africa and grew up in Paris,
described the Citroen as "the perfect car." The owner of La Fondue
Bourguignonne on Ventura Boulevard, he had a Traction Avant shipped
to the United States when he came here 30 years ago.</TE>
<TE>   Last week, he had it repainted black--the first time it has been
painted since it left the factory almost a half-century ago.</TE>
<TE>   Bettina Van Curen of Altadena is a convert to the cult.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm an Alfa Romeo person, but I've become a Citroen person," said
Van Curen, who has three of the cars, including a 1938 Traction
Avant.</TE>
<TE>   Nicknamed Tracbar by the French, the Traction Avant, designed by
Andre Citroen, debuted in 1934. It was one of the first cars with
front-wheel drive and, for decades, the one that worked best.</TE>
<TE>   "The Traction is the Model A of Europe," Van Curen said.</TE>
<TE>   As ubiquitous in Europe as Chevys once were in the United States,
the Traction was produced until 1957. The International Citroen Car
Club estimates that 40,000 of the vehicles are still in use.</TE>
<TE>   Van Curen and her husband, Chuck Forward, an engineer, are among
several hundred collectors living in Southern California.</TE>
<TE>   Admirers of the Citroen's use of hydraulic suspension and other
innovations, the two gathered Thursday night at the Petersen
Automotive Museum in West Los Angeles for a send-off party and to
honor the first group of veterans. The Petersen has been storing 30
cars shipped from Europe for the event.</TE>
<TE>   Petersen Director Dick Messer said he was happy to board the
visitors' Tracbars.</TE>
<TE>   "These cars are built like tanks ... they'll go anywhere," said
Messer. "Some of them have 3-, 4-, 500,000 miles on them."</TE>
<TE>   But it can be difficult getting parts for a car that hasn't been
produced for 45 years.</TE>
<TE>   "[Citroen enthusiasts] carry spare engines," Messer said. "They
carry welding equipment in their own cars. If something breaks down,
they make a new part right there by the side of the road.</TE>
<TE>   "There are no dealerships. There's nothing to fall back on.
They're like pioneers."</TE>
<TE>   Forty-year-old trip organizer Eric Massiet du Biest of Paris said
that ordinary people, not the rich, are making the journey.</TE>
<TE>   Van Curen, who arranged the Petersen event, added: "Citroens don't
appeal to the Ferrari and Rolls-Royce set. These are not wealthy
people who have nothing to do but ship their cars around the world."</TE>
<TE>   The trip across America is part of Massiet du Biest's grand plan
to drive his Traction Avant around the world because, he said, "life
is short and the world is wide."</TE>
<TE>   The Allied soldiers who fought in France in World War II would
have seen Tracbars everywhere. Massiet du Biest said he first had the
idea of honoring American veterans of the European Theater, "before
it's too late," while visiting Omaha Beach and other D-Day sites in
1996.</TE>
<TE>   "It was only there that I realized how bad it was," Massiet du
Biest said. "When you go into the cemetery, you can feel the
sacrifice."</TE>
<TE>   In addition to a few Angelenos and other Americans, the trekkers
are from France, Germany, Belgium, the Netherlands, Switzerland and
Australia.</TE>
<TE>   The $9,000 paid by each couple included the cost of shipping the
car, airfare, meals, lodging and insurance.</TE>
<TE>   The convoy of 30-plus Citroens will start by driving north toward
San Francisco. They will follow Route 66 for part of their journey,
stopping at several national parks and visiting Las Vegas, Santa Fe,
St. Louis and Chicago before New York.</TE>
<TE>   In August, participants will also attend the International Citroen
Car Club Reunion in Amherst, Mass., which is expected to attract
about 1,000 Citroens and their owners.</TE>
<TE>   Veterans will be honored at ceremonies all along the way,
receiving certificates acknowledging the role that American troops
played in ending the Nazi occupation and wishing them well during
this "difficult period of [America's] history," Massiet du Biest
said.</TE>
<TE>   The trip is not a race, because he and his fellow drivers want to
experience the landscape as more than a blur. "If we drive fast, and
we go through villages, we see nothing," he said. "We hope to get no
tickets."</TE>

<HD>2 Complaints Against Newport Cite Violations of
Open-Meeting Law</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEAN O. PASCO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Complaints charging Newport Beach with violating the state's
open-meeting law have been filed with the Orange County district
attorney's office.</LD>
<LD>   The allegations center on two closed-door votes by the Newport
Beach City Council in recent months authorizing the hiring of
lobbyists. The lobbyists were approved as subcontractors to law firms
working on the city's goal of extending flight and noise restrictions
at John Wayne Airport.</LD>
<LD>   The public wasn't notified of the votes or told of the hires.
Former Irvine Co. executive Gary H. Hunt and William D. Lowery of
Washington, D.C., are being paid a total of $455,000 through
contracts that end Dec. 31.</LD>
<TE>   "We've received two complaints [against Newport Beach], and they
are both under review," district attorney spokeswoman Tori Richards
said Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   One complaint was filed by Greenlight, an organization in Newport
Beach that pushed for the passage of a city measure that ties
development rights to traffic capacity. Hunt, then at Irvine Co.,
coordinated the company's $440,000 campaign against the initiative.
The second complaint was filed by a Newport Beach activist.</TE>
<TE>   Greenlight spokesman Phil Arst said in a statement that the group
supports the city's efforts to continue flight and noise restrictions
at John Wayne but does not condone its secret meetings.</TE>
<TE>   The general counsel for the California First Amendment Coalition
said the city should be challenged. "I'm happy to see this is being
addressed," Terry Francke said.</TE>
<TE>   The Ralph M. Brown Act allows city councils to meet privately to
discuss actual or possible litigation and to hire attorneys to handle
lawsuits. Any votes or action taken must be reported, including the
vote or abstention of every member present.</TE>
<TE>   Newport Beach City Atty. Robert Burnham said he was authorized to
hire the lobbyists and to brief the council under "pending
litigation" because the lobbyists are helping promote the city's
legal strategies for keeping the airport restrictions. Neither Hunt
nor Lowery is an attorney in California.</TE>
<TE>   Maintaining restrictions at John Wayne Airport has been a battle
in Newport Beach for 30 years. In March, the City Council agreed in
closed session to hire California Strategies, headed by Hunt. In May,
the council agreed to hire Lowery's firm.</TE>

<HD>$50 Million OKd for Golden State Carpool Lanes</HD>
<DH>Transit: The freeway upgrades, which had been denied
initially, are to be completed by 2007.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CAITLIN LIU</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Proposed carpool lanes for the Golden State Freeway in the San
Fernando Valley are back on track after the California Transportation
Commission agreed Thursday to allocate $50 million toward the
project.</LD>
<LD>   In April, the state commission denied a $193-million request by
the Metropolitan Transportation Authority to help complete carpool
lanes in both directions on the Golden State Freeway between the
Hollywood Freeway and California 134.</LD>
<LD>   The move could have delayed the project four or five years.</LD>
<TE>   The new decision--which came after officials from the governor's
office, the California Department of Transportation and the MTA
worked together on a new financing package that would fund the
project in stages--allows the extra lanes to be completed as
originally scheduled in 2007, said David Yale, the MTA's director of
regional planning.</TE>
<TE>   Yale praised the San Fernando Valley Transportation Strike Force,
an advocacy group dedicated to expediting the area's transportation
projects, for working behind the scenes "to emphasize the importance
of the project to legislators and the governor's office."</TE>
<TE>   David Grannis, executive director of the strike force, said timely
completion of the carpool lanes is "a huge, huge benefit for
everyone. We didn't want this delayed five years."</TE>
<TE>   The high-occupancy vehicle lanes will help advance Caltrans' plans
to eventually connect Palmdale to downtown Los Angeles in a
continuous path for carpoolers, said Raja Mitwasi, the agency's
deputy district director for programs.</TE>
<TE>   "That's going to help congestion," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The funding, approved at the commission's meeting in Walnut Creek,
will now allow planning, design, engineering and initial construction
to begin, Yale said.</TE>

<HD>Jerry D. Melton, 69; Directed Hollywood High Drama Dept.</HD>

<LD>Jerry D. Melton, the award-winning director of the theater department
at Hollywood High School from 1968 to 1992, and the man who brought
national acclaim to the school's program, died Thursday of liver
cancer. Melton, 69, was at home in North Hollywood, surrounded by
family and friends--many of them former students--when he succumbed
to the illness, diagnosed only about two weeks ago.</LD>
<LD>   Melton's years at the school were marked by a string of dramatic
and musical productions that were hailed by critics as
near-professional, among them "Hello Dolly," "Cabaret" and "Macbeth."
His relationships with students were remarkable; many of them
remembered him years after graduation as a transformational force in
their lives--a combination of mentor, father and friend.</LD>
<LD>   When news of his illness spread, a small group of former students
quickly put together a testimonial they had planned for 2003. A few
hundred people attended the event Tuesday, among them Carolyn De
Mirjian, a counselor at the school who worked with Melton for 10
years. "He was not only the strongest influence at Hollywood High, he
was the drama department at Hollywood High. His philosophy was,
'Unless you're going to give it your all, don't bother.' I think,
because he expected that of himself, and showed the students through
his example, they tended to rise to his expectations."</LD>
<TE>   During the Tuesday ceremony, one of the school's auditoriums was
named for Melton, and a theater scholarship in his name was
announced. (See story on page E1, which went to press Thursday
afternoon before Melton's death.)</TE>
<TE>   Melton was born in 1933 in O'Brien, Texas, a farm town north of
Abilene. He received a bachelor of arts degree from North Texas
University, then served in the Army--all the while pursuing an
interest in acting and the entertainment industry. His older brother,
Orbin, had become a vice president of the Walt Disney Co., and in the
late 1950s, Melton joined him in Los Angeles, determined to become an
actor and director.</TE>
<TE>   He met his wife, Ruthe, while working backstage at the now-defunct
Players' Ring Gallery theater in the West Hollywood area.</TE>
<TE>   Melton took graduate courses in theater at UCLA, and his original
play, "Pepys &amp; Company," was performed during the university's summer
program. Melton began teaching for the Los Angeles Unified School
District in 1963, and began his long association with Hollywood High
five years later. The school played an important role in the lives of
many family members. During his tenure there, Ruthe Melton
coordinated the costumes for the class productions. She had graduated
from the school; her own parents had met there as students. Three of
the Meltons' four children--Gregory, Kathleen and Mary--studied
theater at the school and two went into the film industry. Gregory, a
film production designer, met his wife, Giovanna, a costume designer,
at the school. Steven is a property master. Mary is a senior editor
at Los Angeles magazine. Kathleen died of AIDS in 1996 at 35.</TE>
<TE>   In 1981, Melton helped to develop the curriculum for the L.A.
Unified School District's Performing Arts Magnet Program, and then
became director and coordinator of the newly established performing
arts magnet Hollywood High, which has an enrollment of more than 300.</TE>
<TE>   When Melton retired from the school 10 years ago, he didn't stop
working. He became an artistic director at the Stella Adler Theatre
Academy,  did some acting and voice-over work and continued his
longtime study of the history of Hawaii, a place he and his wife had
visited more than 35 times.</TE>
<TE>   Melton is survived by his wife Ruthe; sons Steven and Gregory;
daughter Mary; and five grandchildren.</TE>
<TE>   Services are pending.</TE>

<HD>Eddie Morris, 79; Huntington Beach Track Champion</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>JOHN ORTEGA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Eddie Morris, a four-time state sprint champion for Huntington Beach
High School, has died. He was 79.</LD>
<LD>   Morris died of congestive heart failure June 24 at a retirement
home in Vancouver, Wash.; he had been paralyzed from the chest down
last August.</LD>
<LD>   Morris was known as the "World's Fastest Schoolboy" and the
"Huntington Beach Bullet" when he won the 100- and 220-yard dashes in
the 1940 state track and field championships.</LD>
<TE>   "He was so far ahead of his time ... running on these crummy dirt
tracks and using this crummy equipment," said Jim Stangleland, a
teammate of Morris at Huntington Beach. "I don't know what he could
have done on these new Olympic tracks, but he could really fly."</TE>
<TE>   Morris was a well-muscled high school senior whose strength helped
him run 9.5 seconds in the 100-yard dash and 20.7 in the 220 that in
those days was run on a straightaway instead of around a curve.</TE>
<TE>   The 220 time tied the then-national high school record set by
Jesse Owens in 1933.</TE>
<TE>   Morris never got a chance to make an Olympic team because World
War II forced the cancellation of the Games in both 1940 and 1944.</TE>
<TE>   Hamstring injuries slowed Morris at Santa Ana College in 1941 and
at USC in 1942, and he entered the Army later that year.</TE>
<TE>   He was awarded the Purple Heart after being wounded in the South
Pacific in World War II and received a second one while in the Air
Force in the Korean War.</TE>
<TE>   His knees were badly damaged in Korea after he was hurled through
the air by the force of an exploding bomb.</TE>
<TE>   Morris worked for Richfield Oil (now Atlantic Richfield) for 27
years after the Korean War ended.</TE>
<TE>   He retired in the early 1980s and spent much of his time hunting
and fish- ing.</TE>
<TE>   Arthritis forced him to undergo surgery on his neck and back last
year.</TE>
<TE>   While recovering from back surgery, he suffered an accident in his
wheelchair that left him paralyzed from the chest down.</TE>
<TE>   Morris, who lived in Vancouver for the past 12 years, is survived
by his former wife, Janet Glander; daughters Casey, Caralee Harrel
and Clare Stijovic; seven grandchildren; and four great
grandchildren.</TE>

<HD>MTA Planning to Increase Its Bus Fleet</HD>
<DH>Transportation: To reduce crowding, the agency is looking
to buy several hundred vehicles, many containing more seats than
usual.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CAITLIN LIU</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Metropolitan Transportation Authority plans to buy more than 300
special new buses in the next few years to help alleviate crowding on
busy routes throughout Los Angeles County, authorities said Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   Many of the buses, expected to have more seats than standard MTA
buses, will be used on local routes as well as faster Metro Rapid
lines, said John Catoe, MTA's deputy chief executive.</LD>
<LD>   Catoe said some buses will be used for the planned east-west
busway across the San Fernando Valley, which is to open in 2005.</LD>
<TE>   Officials said the MTA has a current fleet of about 2,400 buses
with 40 to 43 seats each. Of the new vehicles, 272 will be extra long
"articulated buses" with midsections that resemble accordions and
each with 60 seats, officials said. By the end of the year, Catoe
said, the MTA will add 30 new buses, each with 47 passenger seats.</TE>
<TE>   Activists who support better conditions for bus riders said they
will reserve judgment on the MTA plan until they learn how much the
new vehicles will increase the agency's overall passenger capacity.</TE>
<TE>   "This is all good, but we believe most of these are replacement
buses," said Eric Mann, the former chairman of the Bus Riders Union
and now a member of the organization's planning committee.</TE>
<TE>   According to the MTA, some of the new buses will replace older
vehicles. Agency officials could not provide an estimate Thursday on
the net gain in passenger seats. Officials declined to estimate the
cost of buying the buses, saying that they have not yet solicited
bids for the articulated buses.</TE>
<TE>   The announcement on new buses came as MTA officials reiterated
that they believe the agency is in full compliance with a court order
requiring a reduction in bus crowding.</TE>
<TE>   Currently, 98% of all MTA bus trips fall within the standard set
by a consent decree, which mandates that no more than 20% of MTA
passengers--or eight people on a typical bus--be forced to stand at
any given time, Catoe said.</TE>
<TE>   "We will not be able, 100% of the time, to abide by the
[standard]," Catoe said, saying MTA employees who draw up bus
schedules cannot plan for everything. Unexpected events, such as
sudden traffic slowdowns, could cause ridership to spike without
warning and force more riders to stand, Catoe said.</TE>
<TE>   The MTA will present its position in a quarterly report to a
court-appointed special master, who will determine whether the agency
is complying with the consent decree. Bus rider advocates said they
don't believe the MTA's figures or that the agency is complying with
the court order.</TE>
<TE>   "The bus riders on the street aren't feeling any relief," said
Erica Teasley, western region counsel for the National Assn. for the
Advancement of Colored People's Legal Defense and Education Fund,
which filed a civil rights lawsuit against the MTA in 1994 on behalf
of the Bus Riders Union and other groups. That lawsuit resulted in
the 1996 consent decree, which the MTA has unsuccessfully appealed
several times.</TE>
<TE>   MTA officials said they are pursuing a variety of strategies, such
as rail and more Metro Rapid buses, to better serve riders.</TE>

<HD>Santa Monica Settles Tainted Water Case</HD>
<DH>Health: City approves an accord with two oil firms it
partly blames for contamination by gasoline additive MTBE. Court OK
is required.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARTHA GROVES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Santa Monica City Council has approved a settlement with two oil
companies that the city said were partly responsible for
contaminating its municipal water supply with the gasoline additive
MTBE.</LD>
<LD>   The accord comes six years after Santa Monica discovered the
turpentine-scented compound in its drinking water wells--drawing
attention to a problem now known to affect thousands of public and
private wells across the nation.</LD>
<LD>   Under the settlement, Chevron Products Co., a subsidiary of
ChevronTexaco Corp., and Exxon Mobil Corp. would pay to design, build
and operate a facility to treat the city's water--a venture that is
expected to cost more than $200 million over several years. The
companies would also pay the city $30 million in cash to cover
damages.</LD>
<TE>   The settlement, still subject to court approval, is expected to be
closely watched by other communities with MTBE contamination linked
to underground gas tanks and pipelines. The case is being handled by
Superior Court Judge Stephen J. Sundvold in Orange County, where it
was moved at the request of the oil companies.</TE>
<TE>   With the council's approval, "we have reached an important
milestone toward restoring Santa Monica's water and ridding our wells
of a dangerous chemical," said City Atty. Marsha Jones Moutrie. "We
still have a long way to go, but we're moving in the right
direction."</TE>
<TE>   Two years ago, Santa Monica sued seven major oil companies and 11
other manufacturers, suppliers, refiners and pipeline operators,
claiming that they had tainted much of the city's drinking water with
MTBE, a probable cancer-causing chemical that is added to gasoline to
make it burn cleaner.</TE>
<TE>   MTBE, or methyl tertiary butyl ether, was first added to gasoline
more than two decades ago to reduce air pollution. Its use became
widespread in the early 1990s.</TE>
<TE>   But further research indicated that the chemical is dangerous and
spreads fast in soil and ground water. Even small amounts can make
drinking water smell like turpentine.</TE>
<TE>   Communities nationwide then found water wells contaminated with
the substance. A sweeping cleanup will cost at least $29 billion, a
study by Santa Monica and several other cities found.</TE>
<TE>   Santa Monica was suddenly thrust into a discussion of the
little-known chemical in 1996, when MTBE was detected in seven of its
11 drinking water wells. The city was unusual in having its own water
supply, and the closure of the seven wells sent it scrambling to find
replacement water.</TE>
<TE>   Years ago, ChevronTexaco, Shell Oil Co. and Exxon Mobil
voluntarily agreed to help the city deal with the contamination. But
that pact expired in January 2000. The city sued five months later.</TE>
<TE>   In the interim, Shell has been paying Santa Monica $3.25 million a
year to cover the cost of importing water. Federal and regional
environmental officials had designated Shell as the company primarily
responsible for the contamination, and that persuaded it to help the
city pay for more imported water, said Craig Perkins, city director
of environmental and public works management.</TE>
<TE>   As part of its settlement, the city has agreed to cease legal
action against the two oil companies. If the city prevails against
the oil companies not involved in the settlement, Exxon Mobil and
ChevronTexaco might be able to recoup a portion of the amount they
have agreed to spend to restore the city's drinking water, Perkins
said.</TE>
<TE>   It will be at least five years before the facility to treat all
the city's water opens, he added.</TE>
<TE>   Exxon Mobil said in a statement that it was pleased with the
accord. Rod Spackman, Chevron Products' manager of government and
public affairs in the Los Angeles area, said: "Protracted litigation
around these issues we think is unproductive, and you draw resources
away from fixing the problem."</TE>
<TE>   Spackman added that "it is our strong belief that our facilities
have in no way contributed to the contamination." Chevron Products is
based in San Ramon, Calif.</TE>
<TE>   Said City Atty. Moutrie: "It is to [the firms'] credit that they
are accepting responsibility, rather than fighting it tooth and
nail."</TE>

<HD>Jack Olsen, 77; Prolific Master of the True-Crime Genre</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DENNIS McLELLAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Jack Olsen, whose well-researched nonfiction portraits of serial
killers, rapists and assorted other criminals and their victims
earned him a reputation as "the dean of true-crime writers," has
died. He was 77.</LD>
<LD>   Olsen died of a heart attack Tuesday at his home on Bainbridge
Island in Washington state.</LD>
<LD>   A former Time magazine bureau chief and senior writer for Sports
Illustrated, Olsen wrote 31 books on topics ranging from bridge to
boxing.</LD>
<TE>   But he is best known for the true-crime books, particularly those
dealing with rape.</TE>
<TE>   "Son: A Psychopath and His Victims," earned him a special Edgar
Award from the Mystery Writers of America. "Predator: Rape, Madness,
and Injustice in Seattle," was an American Mystery Award winner for
best true crime book. And "Doc: The Rape of the Town of Lovell" won
an Edgar for best fact crime book.</TE>
<TE>   Among Olsen's other books are "The Bridge at Chappaquiddick,"
"Charmer: The True Story of a Ladies' Man and his Victims," "Salt of
the Earth: One Family's Journey Through the Violent American
Landscape," "Hastened to the Grave: The Gypsy Murder Investigation"
and "Last Man Standing: The Tragedy and Triumph of Geronimo Pratt."</TE>
<TE>   "Jack Olsen and Ann Rule are the best-known true-crime writers
ever," said Charles Spicer, Olsen's editor at St. Martin's Press.</TE>
<TE>   "Jack was dedicated to the truth, and he was an absolutely elegant
writer."</TE>
<TE>   As a crime book writer, "he refused to embroider," Spicer said.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of true-crime books now sort of blur the line between fact
and fiction. They tend to re-dramatize action, whereas Jack was a
purist. He insisted that everything in his books absolutely be based
on research and fact."</TE>
<TE>   Ann Rule, who is best known for "The Stranger Beside Me" about
serial killer Ted Bundy, called Olsen "a major talent."</TE>
<TE>   "The first thing any true-crime writer needs to be able to do is
pick an interesting case, and Jack unerringly could spot the cases
that would be interesting to readers," Rule said. "He wrote about the
east side rapist in Spokane ['Son'] and the one in the San Francisco
area about gypsies who conned older men out of their money ['Hastened
to the Grave'] and of course, the doctor in Utah who was sexually
abusing patients ['Doc'].</TE>
<TE>   "So it was his instinct to pick a case, and he was a brilliant
writer who had a strong narrative style."</TE>
<TE>   Those who knew Olsen recall an outspoken man of integrity with a
mischievous sense of humor and a love of practical jokes.</TE>
<TE>   "He was also extremely combative," Rule said. "He would not suffer
bad reviews gladly. He was always in a battle."</TE>
<TE>   In an interview, Olsen said he was disappointed with the state of
the genre he helped popularize.</TE>
<TE>   "What now passes for true crime is a weakly researched overblown
kind of National Enquirer writing with a heavy emphasis on
fictionalization and blighted romance."</TE>
<TE>   Crime "is an important, meaningful and revealing subject, and good
books will continue to be written on the subject, but they won't be
formula works and they won't be junk. They'll be carefully researched
and skillfully written, probably by bright and scholarly young
writers just coming into their own."</TE>
<TE>   A Philadelphia native, his interest in crime was triggered at the
University of Pennsylvania during a criminology class field trip to
Holmesburg Prison.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm 19 years old and we get inside and I see all these guys who
look just like me. I thought that criminals looked different," he
told the New York Times.</TE>
<TE>   "I start every book with the idea that I want to explain how this
seven or eight pounds of protoplasm went from his mommy's arms to
become a serial rapist or serial killer."</TE>
<TE>   He is survived by his wife, Su; seven children, Jack, of Niwot,
Colo., Susan Jetley, of Boulder, Colo., Julia, of Denver, Evan, of
Little Rock, Ark., Barrie, of New York City, Emily Sara Bischoff, of
Bainbridge Island, and Harper, of Seattle; his mother, Florence Mae
Olsen; a sister, Carolyn Grentz, of Havertown, Pa.; seven
grandchildren; and a great-grandchild. A son, Jonathan, died last
year.</TE>
<TE>   A private memorial service is planned .The family suggests
remembrances be made to the Sierra Club.</TE>

<HD>Motorist Reports Being, um, Victimized by Free CD Player
Installed in Vehicle</HD>

<LD>Los Angeles County Sheriff's Det. Joyce Macheca was visiting
relatives in Wickenburg, Ariz., when she spotted this police log
item: "At a business on East Wickenburg Way, an individual got into
his vehicle to leave work and found someone had installed a CD player
in the dash area. The individual did not know where it came from."</LD>
<LD>   Quipped Macheca: "We need more of those [crimes]. People would be
asking, 'Where was he [the car owner] parked?' "</LD>
<LD>   *</LD>
<TE>   Speaking of surprise extras: A couple of years ago, a Monterey
Park resident's stolen car was found on the street with a Club
antitheft device attached to the steering wheel. Funny thing was, she
didn't own a Club. She concluded there's just no honor among thieves.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Elsewhere on the beat: A woman wearing handcuffs walked into the
L.A. County sheriff's substation in Paramount and explained that her
husband had accidentally shackled her. She said they didn't have a
key and asked deputies to free her. They did--after first checking to
make sure that no jailers were looking for her.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Now if this handcuffed guy walks in ... : The city of Paramount's
newsletter said that a man arrested for shoplifting $72 worth of
women's makeup was carrying more than $1,000. Why hadn't he just paid
for the stuff? the arresting officer asked him. He was in a rush, the
shoplifter explained, and the line was too long.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Write 100 times on the blackboard ... : Lori Murchison of Culver
City High received a fax from CBS about a new TV show and noticed
that the logo (see accompanying) referred to two atoms of hydrogen.
Of course, even if the "2" is elevated above the line, the logo would
say hydrogen squared. But, hey, it's only television.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Lesson No. 2: A reader sent along some directions for a calculator
that contained one miscalculation (see accompanying).</TE>
<TE>   Mystery of the day: On a visit to Kyoto, Japan, Dan Shepard of
Huntington Beach saw one offering of a clothing shop that didn't
translate smoothly into English (see photo). Of course, if such an
item was advertised here, it would be called "Pre-Owned Guts." Anyone
know what it is?</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   With lots of inner beauty: "Still looking for names for the San
Fernando Valley city?" writes Will Sandberg, and of course I am. He
noted that the movie "Magnolia" was set in the Valley. "The movie had
the name half right," Sandberg said. "Not Magnolia, but Outer
Magnolia."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   miscelLAny: I heard a blurb on the radio about another beauty
pageant that has de-emphasized the bathing suit segment: the Miss
Nude California contest.</TE>

<HD>Death Linked to Raw Oysters Prompts Health Warning</HD>
<DH>Hazard: Man is the second to die since May from a bacterium
that can be life-threatening to those with immune system disorders.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NERISSA PACIO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Los Angeles County health officials are warning people with certain
chronic diseases to avoid eating raw oysters after a 44-year-old man
died of a rare bacterial infection last week.</LD>
<LD>   The Latino man's death is the second fatality in the county since
May that was caused by infection with Vibrio vulnificus, typically
acquired from eating raw seafood, especially oysters, from the Gulf
of Mexico.</LD>
<LD>   Health officials said the man became ill five days after eating
two raw oysters at a neighbor's home. He was treated July 11 at Los
Angeles County-USC Medical Center, where he died the following day.</LD>
<TE>   The county Department of Health Services is investigating the 99
Ranch Market on Sepulveda Boulevard in Van Nuys, where the neighbor
allegedly purchased the seafood.</TE>
<TE>   Since 1991, California law has required facilities selling Gulf
Coast oysters to post signs in both Spanish and English, warning
customers of the potential risks of raw oysters, county health
officials said.</TE>
<TE>   The oysters are less expensive than other types.</TE>
<TE>   The store did not have the correct wording on the signs and did
not post warnings in Spanish, said Kenneth Marks of the county
environmental health division. Officials also are probing whether the
store abided by rules that it identify the source of the oysters in a
tag, Marks said.</TE>
<TE>   A manager at the store declined to comment.</TE>
<TE>   The V. vulnificus bacterium can be life-threatening to people with
AIDS, hepatitis, cancer, cirrhosis, diabetes and other diseases that
affect the immune system.</TE>
<TE>   Both men who died this year were Latino and had existing liver
problems.</TE>
<TE>   "The sad thing is most people don't know they're at risk," said
Dr. Laurene Mascola, chief of the acute communicable disease unit in
the county health department. "They think they can smell, taste or
see something is wrong with the oyster. Or they don't realize they
have diabetes or liver problems."</TE>
<TE>   V. vulnificus is naturally present in warm marine waters, and its
numbers peak in the summer.</TE>
<TE>   Though eating raw shellfish is the most common way to become
infected, people with open wounds can also be exposed to the
bacterium through direct contact with seawater.</TE>
<TE>   In healthy people, the infection can cause diarrhea, abdominal
pain and vomiting.</TE>
<TE>   But for those with chronic diseases, the bacteria can infect the
bloodstream and cause fever, chills, decreased blood pressure and
blistering skin lesions.</TE>
<TE>   Symptoms typically start within 24 hours of eating shellfish.
Death can occur within two to three days.</TE>

<HD>Getting Down 'n' Dirty on the Sewage Waiver</HD>

<LD>Those of you not up to speed on "conventional activated sludge" or
"underwater transport mechanisms" or even "Class A bio-solids" might
have been scared away from Wednesday night's meeting at the Orange
County Sanitation District.</LD>
<LD>   A little too technical, perhaps?</LD>
<LD>   It was for me, until an environmentalist at the microphone said
early on that the debate boiled down to "doo-doo in the deep." That's
a language we can all understand.</LD>
<TE>   Luckily, being an ignoramus on the subject didn't stop me from
attending and, come to find out, I stumbled into a historic night.</TE>
<TE>   And nearly four hours after it began, those of us with strong
wills and sturdy bottoms were rewarded with a sudden-death kind of
outcome, in which La Palma Mayor Paul F. Walker broke a 12-12 tie
with a "yes" vote that left a legacy for our children or wasted a lot
of money. If you're keeping score at home, the 12 votes to continue
the waiver all came from inland cities.</TE>
<TE>   Such were the stakes as the district's countywide board debated
whether to ask the Environmental Protection Agency to extend a waiver
that exempts the district from "secondary" treatment of all sewage
instead of just some, as is now the practice. All sewage receives
"primary" treatment before being dumped in the ocean.</TE>
<TE>   Environmentalists framed the debate in near-apocalyptic terms in
discontinuing the waiver. My notes show remarks like "I beg you" or
"From the bottom of my heart, I implore you." The head of a state
lifeguard association said the membership felt "absolutely compelled"
to speak against the waiver. Another speaker didn't want to discuss
the law or science but to speak "from the heart."</TE>
<TE>   The other side was a bit more amorphous in philosophy. It appeared
an amalgam of people who either aren't convinced it's wise to spend
the money to upgrade the sewage treatment, who think it would cost
businesses or residents too much in increased sewer fees, or who
think that dropping the waiver would limit the district's
decision-making.</TE>
<TE>   Even Blake Anderson, district general manager, believed to favor
keeping the waiver, characterized the impending decision in historic
terms. He put it on a timeline with such other seminal Orange County
moments as the purchase and development of the Irvine Ranch and of
the openings of Disneyland and Knott's Berry Farm.</TE>
<TE>   He then wished the board "good luck" in whatever it decided.</TE>
<TE>   The passion behind the policy springs from whether you believe the
partially treated sewage dumped into the ocean is responsible for the
beach closures in recent years. Environmentalists argued that it is,
but, beyond that, wonder why a tourism-oriented county near a beach
settles for a lesser level of sewage treatment than almost all other
water districts in the county.</TE>
<TE>   "The surfing industry has a timetable to it," before pollution
ends the fun, one man said. "The ocean is not going to last." He gave
it about another 10 years.</TE>
<TE>   Skeptical board members suggested the partially treated sewage
isn't responsible for the foulness of beach waters. The scientific
studies aren't conclusive, they argued.</TE>
<TE>   Seal Beach representative Patty Campbell virtually snorted her
retort: "To say we don't have enough information is like Philip
Morris saying smoking doesn't cause cancer."</TE>
<TE>   Board member Russell Patterson from Villa Park said a "yes" vote
would handcuff the district to outmoded treatment methods. "To me,
it's [spending] $271 million so we feel good."</TE>
<TE>   So it went for the 2 1/2 hours that board members spent going
around the table, airing their views. Finally, at 9:35 p.m., Orange
County Supervisor Tom Wilson called for a vote on board member Brian
Brady's motion to commit to secondary treatment of all sewage and
discontinue the waiver when it expires next summer.</TE>
<TE>   "If we leave here with the W-word on our lips, we're heading for a
train wreck," Brady said. (Puzzled minds fretted a few seconds before
settling on "Waiver.")</TE>
<TE>   After their victory, environmentalists celebrated.</TE>
<TE>   Not among them was Brea representative Roy Moore. He wanted the
board to commit to secondary treatment but also retain the waiver.
"It's win-win," he grumbled, irritated that the winning side played
on the perception that the waiver was bad public relations.</TE>
<TE>   "They said we couldn't leave the room with the W-word because
people would be [ticked] off," Moore said. "Who gives a [bleep] if
they're [ticked] off?"</TE>
<TE>   On a night devoted to sewage, Moore's choice of words seemed oddly
fitting.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Margaret E. Lynn, 81, who directed the Army's music and theater
program to entertain troops and encourage soldiers and officers to
develop their talent, died June 11 of cancer.</LD>
<LD>   Lynn founded the program in 1962. By 1976, the Washington Post
called it "the largest producing organization of music and theater in
the world." It staged more than 25,000 performances before 2.5
million people each year. The program is now called the Army
Entertainment Program.</LD>
<LD>   A former Radio City Music Hall Rockette and Broadway performer,
Lynn became one of the first civilian "actress technicians" to work
with troops overseas after World War II. Her commanding officer was
the stage director Joshua Logan, with whom she worked on dozens of
productions.</LD>
<TE>   Unlike the USO, which brought in big-name talent, Lynn focused on
developing home-grown entertainment, teaming up sergeants and
colonels in productions such as "You're a Good Man, Charlie Brown"
and "The Fantasticks." She encouraged the members of military
families to participate in the shows, and aggressively commandeered
unused military buildings to turn into theaters.</TE>
<TE>   The Dallas native left the military in 1982 to form her own
production company, Creative Consultants, which worked with Disney
and other studios. She also was executive director of the American
Theater Assn. in the 1980s.</TE>

<HD>Firm Ready to Turn Landfill Into Golf Course</HD>
<DH>Recreation: Developer's plan calls for 110-acre links and
equestrian center on portion of Palos Verdes dump.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEAN MERL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Five years after a sprawling landfill on the affluent Palos Verdes
Peninsula accepted its last truckload of trash, the site's owner--Los
Angeles County--announced plans to build a public golf course there.</LD>
<LD>   That was in 1985.</LD>
<LD>   Now, a private developer--the only one to bid on the project--is
hoping to gain approval for what would be the first new county-owned
18-hole golf course in more than three decades.</LD>
<TE>   The 110-acre project, on a large chunk of the Palos Verdes
Landfill site, also would include a seven-acre equestrian center as
well as riding and hiking trails along its perimeter.</TE>
<TE>   "We think it will be a real asset to the community," said Rob
Katherman, a longtime Palos Verdes Peninsula resident and a Los
Angeles City Hall lobbyist who helped form Meritage Rolling Hills
Golf to design, build and operate the course.</TE>
<TE>   The developer would shoulder construction and most other costs
associated with the project and pay the cash-strapped county a
percentage of the revenue.</TE>
<TE>   Meritage's $12-million proposal, which calls for a
Mediterranean-style clubhouse, is undergoing environmental reviews.
The report on those reviews, expected to be released this summer,
will set the stage for public hearings and, ultimately, a decision by
the county Board of Supervisors.</TE>
<TE>   But a well-organized group of residents in surrounding communities
is campaigning hard to stop the project.</TE>
<TE>   The residents contend that the old-style landfill accepted enough
toxins in its day to threaten the adjacent homes, two schools and two
churches if the material is disturbed through grading and the regular
heavy irrigation required for a golf course.</TE>
<TE>   They also say that ground water supplies would be threatened if
the development were to dislodge the many tons of liquid industrial
solvents and other toxins entombed in the landfill, which lacks the
protective bottom liner and clay cap required for newer landfills.</TE>
<TE>   And they are not waiting for the environmental impact report,
which they already are attacking as insufficient.</TE>
<TE>   They believe the site should be reserved for uses that do not
require a lot of grading, soil importation or watering, including the
existing 115-horse stables and riding areas, a nature center, a
picnic area and bicycle, jogging and walking paths.</TE>
<TE>   The equestrian facilities would be moved under the Meritage
proposal. The developer would provide the land for the equestrian
center, but the city of Rolling Hills Estates would have to pay for
relocating the municipally owned facility, probably with state parks
bond funds.</TE>
<TE>   "Putting a golf course there is a very bad idea," said Joan
Davidson, a former local school board president who recently led the
formation of South Bay CARES (Citizens Aligned for Responsible
Environmental Solutions) to fight the project.</TE>
<TE>   In the weeks following Meritage's public unveiling of its proposal
in February, South Bay CARES organizers began enlisting prominent
community members, including a former state assemblyman and the
president of the school board in Torrance, where a mudslide of
still-undetermined cause 15 months ago damaged homes built in the
1970s right below the landfill.</TE>
<TE>   They have dug through old documents about the landfill and
launched a Web site www.southbaycares.org that they update almost
daily. They contacted local school boards and surrounding cities and
persuaded officials in two of them--Rolling Hills Estates, whose
boundaries include the landfill, and Rancho Palos Verdes--to write
letters to the county expressing concerns about possible
environmental hazards at two nearby schools.</TE>
<TE>   "We consider this a sleeping giant, and we don't want to see it
awakened," South Bay CARES executive committee member Christina
Zimmerman said as she and several others recently conducted an
unofficial tour of the site.</TE>
<TE>   The developer, however, said the opponents are using outdated
information and not taking into account the modern methods he
believes can help meet the demand for affordable golf while ensuring
public safety.</TE>
<TE>   The facility would join 17 other county courses--all operated by
private firms--that yield about $16 million a year to the public
treasury, said Steve Duron, golf operations administrator for the
county Department of Parks and Recreation.</TE>
<TE>   The Meritage site was used for mining and quarrying diatomaceous
earth, sand and gravel during the first half of the 20th century and
became a landfill in 1952. It was operated by a private refuse firm
until the county Sanitation Districts took it over in 1957.</TE>
<TE>   From 1964 until it closed in 1980, the Palos Verdes Landfill
accepted hazardous wastes, including oil refinery wastes, pesticides,
solvents and contaminated soil.</TE>
<TE>   Although records are incomplete, county officials estimated that
at one point during the 1970s, Palos Verdes was the disposal site for
40% of the Class 1, or most hazardous, waste in the Los Angeles
region.</TE>
<TE>   Smaller parcels of the landfill have been developed into the South
Coast Botanic Garden and Ernie Howlett Park. The undeveloped acreage
includes a gas-to-energy generation plant, which taps methane gas
from the decomposing garbage; an electrical substation; and
facilities to maintain the landfill. The county will continue to
monitor the landfill and maintain those sites even if the golf course
is built.</TE>
<TE>   On May 11, 1999, nearly two decades after the landfill closed, the
California Environmental Protection Agency's Department of Toxic
Substances Control signed off on the last of a series of measures to
make the site as safe as possible and to provide for maintenance and
monitoring. That cleared the way for county officials to seek new
uses for the site.</TE>
<TE>   The county soon revived its golf course idea, citing a growing
demand for affordable courses in the area and a 1985 recommendation
of a citizens committee, which South Bay CARES disputes.</TE>
<TE>   "This proposal has really activated us," said Bruce Trotman,
another South Bay CARES leader who got involved when he saw Davidson
criticizing the project on a local cable television show. "The more
we find out, the more concerns we have."</TE>
<TE>   But developer Katherman, who holds a master's degree in
environmental engineering, said golf course opponents are wrongly
"instilling fear in some of the neighbors, based on outdated
information."</TE>
<TE>   Katherman, a former planning commissioner for Rancho Palos Verdes,
the largest of the four cities on the peninsula, said most people he
has talked to are willing to wait to pass judgment until the
environmental report is finished.</TE>
<TE>   "They like the idea of a golf course there," Katherman said. "For
most people, and I believe this applies to CARES people too, it's a
matter of can you build it safely or not?"</TE>
<TE>   Advances in irrigation technology and golf course design will
enable Meritage to build and maintain a course without heavy watering
and without disturbing the landfill contents, Katherman said. The
system is designed to add no water to the landfill cap, which would
be covered with an impenetrable liner along key parts of the course
and elsewhere protected with drains and added soil, he said. More
about the plans can be found on the developer's Web site,
www.meritagegolf.com.</TE>
<TE>   The Palos Verdes project would join the list of about 70 golf
courses nationwide that have been built on closed
landfills--including some containing large amounts of toxic
industrial wastes, said Jim Aardema, a Tampa, Fla.-based developer
who has built on polluted sites.</TE>

<LD>Nineteen more passengers who suffered injuries in an April train
collision in Placentia have filed suit against the Burlington
Northern Santa Fe rail line and Metrolink, alleging negligence and
willful misconduct.</LD>
<LD>   The lawsuit, filed in Orange County Superior Court, claims that
the railway's warning signal was inadequate and that railway
officials were aware of the dangers.</LD>
<LD>   Three people were killed and more than 200 were injured when a
Burlington freight train hit a Metrolink train April 23.</LD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Complaints charging the city of Newport Beach with violating the
state's open meetings law have been filed with the Orange County
district attorney's office.</LD>
<LD>   The allegations center on two closed-door votes by the Newport
Beach City Council in recent months authorizing the hiring of
lobbyists. The lobbyists were approved as subcontractors to law firms
working on the city's goal of extending flight and noise restrictions
at John Wayne Airport.</LD>
<LD>   The public wasn't notified of the votes or told of the hires.
Former Irvine Co. executive Gary H. Hunt and William D. Lowery of
Washington, D.C., are being paid $455,000.</LD>

<HD>House Rejects Bid to Cut Back Forest Research</HD>
<DH>Environment: Vote largely ignores the Bush administration's
request to shift funding to other areas, such as inventorying.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BETTINA BOXALL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The U.S. House of Representatives approved budget language late
Wednesday rejecting a Bush administration proposal that would have
taken a big bite out of U.S. Forest Service research in California.</LD>
<LD>   The House appropriations bill for the Department of the Interior
and related agencies kept Forest Service research on its current
track, largely ignoring administration requests to redirect funding
to several other areas.</LD>
<LD>   A Forest Service analysis last winter concluded that in California
the budget proposal would have forced the elimination of dozens of
research positions, the closing of two laboratories and reductions in
a number of research programs involving aquatic and other wildlife
species.</LD>
<TE>   The administration wanted to spend about $38 million to greatly
expand forest inventory efforts, which some critics saw as a bow to
commercial logging interests. It also wanted to develop computer
modeling software for different forest management approaches and to
increase research into the use of wood fiber for energy production.</TE>
<TE>   "I had to recommend some hard choices," U.S. Agriculture
Undersecretary Mark Rey said of the proposal, adding that he had
consistently been told that the Forest Service should step up its
inventory programs. "Our data is not current. We are not following
forest trends."</TE>
<TE>   The House did increase funding for inventory work--basically a
forest census--but not by nearly the amount the administration
wanted. It gave Forest Service research programs $252 million--$9
million more than the administration had requested and $10.6 million
more than the previous year's funding.</TE>
<TE>   The House Appropriations Committee report also denounced the
administration recommendations. "The committee rejects the proposed
budget and allocations, as they are poorly conceived and were not
coordinated at all with key constituencies," the committee's report
stated.</TE>
<TE>   The proposal ran into opposition from conservation groups and
professional foresters, who worried that it would eliminate critical
research. Both conservative and liberal members of Congress
complained that it would kill valuable programs in their districts.</TE>
<TE>   Rey said that the administration had not recommended any specific
cuts in personnel or programs and did not know precisely how the
funding shift would have played out in California.</TE>
<TE>   In terms of the entire Interior appropriations bill, he said, "The
administration's overall spending objectives were met. So everyone
left the field smiling."</TE>
<TE>   The Senate is expected to take up the budget bill next week, when
the administration's research recommendation are expected to meet the
same fate.</TE>
<TE>   "I think there was a pretty strong, convincing case that the Bush
administration's interest in switching more to research that would
support commodity production just flew in the face of the needs of
the Forest Service," said Michael Francis, director of the national
forests program for the Wilderness Society.</TE>
<TE>   His organization was not so happy about some other elements of the
Interior bill, saying it cut $52 million from a federal land
acquisition fund and relaxed environmental reviews of grazing on
national forest land.</TE>
<TE>   Also defeated was a floor amendment that would have restricted
crops grown on leased land in federal wildlife refuges in the Klamath
Basin. Grains would have been favored over crops that use more water
and pesticides.</TE>

<LD>A Richmond man was shot to death behind the wheel of his car in front
of his family during a road rage incident.</LD>
<LD>   Raul Jimenez, 30, was killed instantly. His sons, ages 11 and 6,
their mother Laura Gibbs, 33, who is eight months pregnant with their
third son, and friend Bobby Rivas were also in the car. Police said
no one else was hit.</LD>
<LD>   The incident occurred early Wednesday. Jimenez's station wagon had
just passed a dark-colored Mitsubishi in the eastbound lanes of
International Boulevard in Oakland. He was stopped at an intersection
when the other car pulled alongside.</LD>
<TE>   Jimenez and the driver of the Mitsubishi exchanged glares and
words for a few moments before the shooting.</TE>

<LD>Thirty sites in the San Diego County water supply system have tested
negative for illness-causing bacteria, officials said Thursday. The
tests contradicted tests at 11 sites Monday that were positive for
coliform bacteria, which can cause vomiting, fever and flu-like
symptoms.</LD>
<LD>   After the follow-up tests, officials concluded that the earlier
tests were inaccurate. The San Diego County Water Authority, which
supplies water to 23 local agencies serving 2.7 million people, is
attempting to determine why the earlier tests gave false positives.</LD>

<HD>Navy Begins Probe Into Shooting Near Base</HD>

<LD>Military investigators have launched a probe into the shooting of a
woman who was walking her dog just outside the fence line of Naval
Base Ventura County.</LD>
<LD>   "We want to find out what transpired, since we are so close to
where the alleged shot was fired," base spokesman Vance Vasquez said.
"Right now we are assisting the Oxnard Police Department."</LD>
<LD>   The 51-year-old woman, whose identity was not disclosed Thursday,
was taken to Ventura County Medical Center after the shooting, which
occurred just before noon Wednesday. She underwent surgery for a
gunshot wound to the right hip and remained hospitalized Thursday in
stable condition, officials said.</LD>
<TE>   The woman was walking her dog near the end of Arnold Road past
Hueneme Road when she was shot, Oxnard Sgt. Scott Hebert said. "It
looks like it may have come off of the base," Hebert said. "The
person who got shot said she never heard or saw anything."</TE>
<TE>   Hebert said Oxnard detectives immediately interviewed several
people at a nearby beach. Authorities said there were no witnesses.</TE>
<TE>   A base shooting range is about 1 1/2 miles from where the woman
was hit but was not in use Wednesday, Vasquez said. He added that
safety procedures are in place to prevent a stray bullet from going
off the range.</TE>

<TE>   The woman got in her car and drove home before calling police,
Hebert said.</TE>
<TE>   Hebert said Oxnard detectives immediately returned to the area and
interviewed several people at a nearby beach. Authorities said there
were no witnesses.</TE>
<TE>   "After hearing everything, we determined that more than likely
[the gunshot] came from the base," Hebert said. "Whether it was
intentional or not, we don't know."</TE>
<TE>   Hebert said detectives faxed their findings to the Navy's
investigative unit because "it appears the jurisdiction will be on
the base."</TE>
<TE>   The woman was walking her dog in a remote area of sandy berms and
beachfront outside the northern tip of the base and south of a nearby
power plant, Hebert said.</TE>
<TE>   A base shooting range is about 1 1/2 miles from where the woman
was hit but was not in use Wednesday, Vasquez said. Even if the range
had been open, Vasquez said, safety procedures are in place to
prevent a stray bullet from going off the range.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a good distance away," Vasquez said of the range. "[It]
faces the ocean anyway, and there is a large berm off to the side."</TE>

<HD>Latino Youth Offenders Face Harsher Treatment, Study Finds</HD>
<DH>Justice: A mix of factors are found to contribute to a
higher incarceration rate. Community organizations search for
solutions.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MICHELLE MUNN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Latinos are detained in juvenile justice systems 1.5 times more often
and are twice as likely to be incarcerated as their white peers,
according to a national study released Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   "Nationwide, there's harsher treatment of Latino youth than white
youth, even for the same offense," said Mark Soler, president of
Youth Law Center, a partner organization in the group that
commissioned the study. "These are matters for concern."</LD>
<LD>   The concern extends to California--home to 11 million
Latinos--where 48% of those in California Youth Authority lockups are
Latino, according to state and federal figures. Moreover, the average
stay for Latinos is longer: 34.3 months compared with 30.5 months for
whites, and 37.4 months for blacks. The study released Thursday found
that Latino youths from Los Angeles were arrested 2.3 times more
often than whites, were tried as adults 2.4 times more often, and
were imprisoned as adults 7.3 times more often than whites from 1996
to 1998.</LD>
<TE>   The report was commissioned by Building Blocks for Youth, an
alliance of children's advocates, law enforcement officials and
community organizers.</TE>
<TE>   Several criminologists, as well as law enforcement and Latino
rights' officials, said they were not surprised by the findings. A
complex mix of factors contributes to the high numbers, they said,
including cultural differences, economic disadvantage, racial
profiling and the lack of alternatives to gangs and crimes.</TE>
<TE>   Raul Yzaquirre, president of the National Council of La Raza, said
the report demonstrates "unfair treatment of Latinos in the juvenile
justice system." He added, "Our youth are denied equal opportunities
and representation as a result of inadequate bilingual services and
culturally insensitive environments."</TE>
<TE>   Sylvester Tellez, 20, who lives in the Pico-Union district, has
firsthand experience with the system. His grandmother and father were
in gangs, and he joined a gang at 12, he said. Four months later, he
was arrested for possessing an Uzi submachine gun, the first of five
run-ins with the law.</TE>
<TE>   "You go to County Jail in L.A., or anywhere in the state, Latinos
are the majority in any cell, in any dorm, in any yard," said Tellez,
who served two years for carjacking but now works as a job placement
counselor at "Homies Without Needles," a nonprofit youth counseling
group, "I don't have anything against it, but are they really going
to know how to beat it when they get out?"</TE>
<TE>   Franklin Zimring, a professor of criminology at UC Berkeley's
Boalt Hall School of Law, said some of California's toughest
streets--and toughest law enforcement--are found in Los Angeles,
Bakersfield, Kern County and Fresno.</TE>
<TE>   "The rates of Hispanic gang activity influence that," Zimring
said. Latinos are "the largest minority group in the toughest
environment"--a reason for the disproportionate numbers.</TE>
<TE>   That may result in a phenomenon known as "justice by geography."
Highly policed areas generate a higher number of police contacts and
arrests, he and other experts said.</TE>
<TE>   Creg Datig, the chief deputy district attorney for Riverside
County, said that in predominantly Latino eastern part of the county,
he often encounters young people from immigrant families in which
both parents work and, left alone, they fall into trouble.</TE>
<TE>   Most juvenile crimes are committed between 3 and 6 p.m., Datig
said.</TE>
<TE>   "It's an unfortunate Catch-22. In their efforts to better
themselves, these folks work so much that we see teenagers coming up
[through the justice system]. I'm in court every day with them,"
Datig said.</TE>
<TE>   In California, each of the 240,000 juveniles arrested annually
comes before a judge.</TE>
<TE>   A convicted juvenile then goes before the Youthful Offender Parole
Board. The board evaluates the offender and recommends detainment,
mental health counseling, drug and alcohol treatment and education.</TE>
<TE>   About 1% of all juvenile offenders who come before a judge wind up
in California Youth Authority facilities, the most secure youth
facilities in the state. The rest do time in county detention centers
or camps.</TE>
<TE>   "There's no real targeting by race," said Susan Wallace, executive
director of the Youthful Offender Parole Board. "We are supposed to,
and I hope we are dealing with these on a case-by-case basis. That's
the difference with the juvenile system: We're interested in
rehabilitation."</TE>
<TE>   According to the study, cultural factors play a role in the
disproportionate Latino sentencing. Avoiding direct eye contact may
suggest disrespect or deception to criminal justice professionals,
but may be a sign of deference in the Latino community, the study
suggests. A youngster from a migrant family may have difficulty
staying in touch with his parole officer after release because the
family moves often.</TE>
<TE>   The study called on lawmakers to develop racially and ethnically
unbiased risk and needs assessments. It urges the elimination of
racial profiling, employing more bilingual and culturally sensitive
workers, and collecting data that accurately distinguish between
Latinos and youth offenders of other races.</TE>
<TE>   Tellez said the toughest problem teenagers face in his
neighborhood is the lack of alternatives to crime. "When you turn
around and there aren't any youth centers, and there's nothing but
gangs, and you're from a third-generation gang family, you start
thinking it's normal stuff."</TE>

<HD>Floyd J. Thompson, 69; Held Longest of Any U.S. POW</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELAINE WOO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Col. Floyd J. Thompson, who endured nearly nine years of torture,
disease and starvation in Vietnam as the longest-held prisoner of war
in American history, has died. He was 69.</LD>
<LD>   Thompson was found dead at his Key West, Fla., home Tuesday after
an apparent heart attack over the weekend, said Charles Ingraham, a
friend and spokesman for the Department of Veterans Affairs in Key
West.</LD>
<LD>   His status as the longest-serving POW was long unacknowledged by
the military, and inspired the book "Glory Denied: The Saga of Jim
Thompson" (W.W. Norton, 2001), by Tom Philpott, military affairs
columnist.</LD>
<TE>   The book chronicles his horrifying experiences as a prisoner and
the personal miseries that befell him after his release.</TE>
<TE>   Thompson was drafted into the Army in 1956, after graduating from
high school in his hometown, Bergenfield, N.J. By the early 1960s he
had been recruited into the Army's Special Forces, the elite unit
whose members were known by their green berets.</TE>
<TE>   In early 1964 he led a team of 11 men into Khe Sanh, one of the
most isolated and forbidding parts of South Vietnam. His mission was
to help stem the flow of North Vietnamese infiltrators from
neighboring Laos.</TE>
<TE>   On March 26, 1964, he was an observer on a reconnaissance plane
when it was hit with small-arms fire. The plane crashed and exploded,
killing the pilot. Thompson was severely wounded and lost
consciousness.</TE>
<TE>   He came to when a Viet Cong guerrilla grabbed his hand to slice
off his finger and take his ruby ring. Thompson gave him the ring and
was taken prisoner.</TE>
<TE>   He saw no other Americans in the next five years, which he spent
in solitary confinement in the jungles of South Vietnam.</TE>
<TE>   His captors bound his elbows behind his back until they touched,
then strung him up from a beam, causing such excruciating pain that
he thought his chest would split open.</TE>
<TE>   For one four-month period, he was locked in a cage so small that
he could neither sit up nor stretch out. His leg irons were removed
for 10 minutes a day, carving out a "chunk of flesh" every time they
were screwed back on.</TE>
<TE>   He escaped five times and was recaptured five times, which brought
more punishment.</TE>
<TE>   Asked how he survived, he told the New York Times last year, "One
day at a time. Every morning I closed my eyes and said, 'One day at a
time.' "</TE>
<TE>   He was near death when he was transferred to a prison in North
Vietnam in 1967. Two years later, he finally was let out of
confinement and was held with other American POWs.</TE>
<TE>   He was so emaciated that when a fellow prisoner saw him, he
thought Thompson was a corpse brought in to torment him. "He looked
like something out of Auschwitz," the former prisoner was quoted by
Philpott as saying.</TE>
<TE>   At one point, Thompson was beaten so badly that he agreed to make
a radio broadcast in which he said he was being well treated.</TE>
<TE>   What kept him going, he later said, were thoughts of his wife,
Alyce, and their four children, the youngest of whom was born the day
after his capture.</TE>
<TE>   He was released, along with many other POWs, after the 1973 peace
agreement. But the dreams that had sustained him for nine years
collapsed in the face of harsh realities.</TE>
<TE>   "The difficulty of living, after so courageously defying death's
call in the bamboo cages of Vietnam, haunted him in the land of the
free," Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), himself a POW in Vietnam, wrote in
the forward to "Glory Denied " of Thompson's travails back home.</TE>
<TE>   "Glory Denied" was an interweaving of oral histories taken, not
only from Thompson but also from his fellow soldiers, his doctors,
his friends and his family. Thompson would later dismiss the book as
"half lies, half truths," a criticism apparently aimed largely at his
wife's portrayal of their relationship.</TE>
<TE>   By her account, theirs was a flawed marriage before his capture. A
gung-ho careerist, he had been absent for the births of all his
children. He had volunteered to go to Vietnam, even though she was
expecting their fourth child.</TE>
<TE>   She screamed and went into labor when an Army chaplain showed up
at her door to tell her his plane had been shot down. After a while,
she came to believe that he was dead. Given the cold shoulder by
other military wives on the base, she took their children and moved
to Massachusetts with a retired Army sergeant.</TE>
<TE>   When word finally reached her that Thompson was alive, she fought
fiercely to keep his captivity a secret. At one point she tried to
have him declared legally dead.</TE>
<TE>   "I wanted to be free to start over," she said in the book.</TE>
<TE>   In 1971 Thompson escaped and was free for nearly two days, a feat
that later would earn him the Silver Star. When U.S. authorities
learned of his heroic act, they asked Alyce for permission to
publicize his captivity, but she refused.</TE>
<TE>   As a result, the person publicly identified as the longest-held
POW was Lt. Cmdr. Everett Alvarez of the Navy, who had been captured
four months after Thompson. The military's failure for many years to
acknowledge his status contributed to the bitterness Thompson felt to
his final days.</TE>
<TE>   Alyce returned to him when he was released in 1973, but the
reunion quickly failed.</TE>
<TE>   After nine years away, he found that he was no longer the boss of
his family. He drank excessively and beat his children. His return
was particularly disruptive for the son who had been born after his
capture: The boy had come to believe that the sergeant was his
father.</TE>
<TE>   Thompson and his wife divorced.</TE>
<TE>   He remarried and divorced again. He battled alcoholism, fell into
a crippling depression and tried to kill himself.</TE>
<TE>   In 1981, he suffered a massive heart attack and a stroke that left
him in a coma for months, limited his speech and partially paralyzed
his right side. The following year he was forced to retire from the
Army.</TE>
<TE>   In 1988 President Ronald Reagan gave him a Prisoner of War Medal
at the White House.</TE>
<TE>   Thompson spent his last years estranged from his family. He lived
alone in a seaside condominium in Key West, often not emerging for
two or three weeks at a stretch. When he did go out, more often than
not it was to take part in military and veterans functions.</TE>
<TE>   "He was a pretty quiet person, but when you engaged him in
conversation, he was a very interesting individual to listen to,"
said Ingraham. "He was very strong in his convictions. Duty, honor
and country--that's what he stood by."</TE>
<TE>   He is survived by his daughters, Laura, Ruth and Pamela, and his
son, Floyd Jr.</TE>

<HD>UC Regents Increase Nonresident Tuition</HD>
<DH>Education: The hikes for out-of-state undergraduate and
graduate students will begin this fall.</DH>

<DL>SAN FRANCISCO</DL>
<LD>Faced with an unresolved state budget shortfall, University of
California regents voted Thursday to raise tuition by 10% for
nonresident undergraduates and by 4% for nonresident graduate
students, beginning this fall.</LD>
<LD>   The regents approved an additional 6% tuition hike, effective next
spring, for undergraduates from out of state.</LD>
<LD>   The decision, approved by a 14-1 vote of the regents present at
the regular bimonthly meeting here, does not affect California
residents. They make up the overwhelming majority of the university's
students, including nearly 95% of the freshmen arriving on campus
this fall.</LD>
<TE>   The vote Thursday means that for nonresident undergraduate
students, tuition will increase by $1,070 this fall and by another
$235 in the spring. That will bring the annual tuition for those
students to $12,009 for the coming year and to $12,480 for 2003-04.</TE>
<TE>   Nonresident graduate student tuition will be $11,132 for the
coming year, up $428.</TE>
<TE>   All nonresident students, in addition, pay mandatory systemwide
fees of $3,859 for undergraduates and $4,914 for graduate students.</TE>
<TE>   University officials said the higher tuition is necessary to help
cover the rising cost of providing health benefits to UC employees
and to pay for UC outreach programs to elementary and high school
students.</TE>
<TE>   Tuition for the university's nonresident students has risen at an
average annual rate of about 4% in recent years and is typically far
less controversial than increasing fees for in-state students, who
have greater influence in Sacramento.</TE>
<TE>   But several regents on Thursday voiced concerns about the
increases, and student representatives said they worried that the
rising tuition will discourage many foreign and out-of-state students
from applying.</TE>
<TE>   "We need the diversity that these students bring to our
classrooms," argued Kenneth Burch, a graduate student in physics at
UC San Diego and president of the UC Students Assn. The organization
represents the university's 187,000 undergraduate and graduate
students.</TE>
<TE>   "Sept. 11 should have taught us that we need to be training people
to be our leaders who have a broad view of the world," said Burch, a
New York native who said he paid out-of-state tuition himself when he
was an undergraduate at UC Santa Cruz.</TE>
<TE>   Two regents, Ward Connerly and David Lee, objected on other
grounds, citing what they viewed as a disconnect between Thursday's
vote and the regents' decision in January to allow undocumented
immigrant students with proven California ties to pay the lower,
resident fees.</TE>

<HD>Union Unveils $100-Million Plan to Help Workers Buy Homes</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOCELYN Y. STEWART</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The AFL-CIO announced plans Thursday to create a $100-million
homeownership program for union families and municipal workers in Los
Angeles--an effort to help workers buy homes in a market with record
high prices.</LD>
<LD>   The program, which is scheduled to begin locally in September,
will provide first mortgages, refinancing and other assistance to as
many as 1,000 workers in the area.</LD>
<LD>   "The need is so great," said Carol Miriam Nixon, director of
public finance for the AFL-CIO's Housing Investment Trust. "Our
unions are very strong in the city of L.A. It's important that we
show our union members we're willing to invest in the community."</LD>
<TE>   In the fall, the union will announce plans to invest in
multifamily housing construction and rehabilitation, Nixon said.</TE>
<TE>   Mayor James K. Hahn praised the union's pledge as an example of
the funding that Los Angeles can now attract because of a
$100-million affordable housing trust fund the city created earlier
this year.</TE>
<TE>   "That kind of commitment demonstrates we're putting our money
where our mouth is," Hahn said, speaking Thursday at a housing
conference at UCLA. "Now that we're investing [in housing], we're
going to see more investment."</TE>
<TE>   Several panelists at the conference noted the importance of
housing to labor and business. Businesses often shy away from cities
where their workers cannot afford to live. The absence of affordable
housing for working families means many employees end up commuting
long distances, increasing traffic congestion and other problems.</TE>
<TE>   The AFL-CIO's HIT HOME program operates in 18 cities across the
nation, including New York, Philadelphia, San Antonio and Milwaukee.</TE>
<TE>   The program, which began in late 2000, is a collaboration between
Countrywide Home Loans, Fannie Mae and the AFL-CIO's Housing
Investment Trust.</TE>
<TE>   Workers who apply for loans or refinancing through the program do
not pay the costs of home appraisals or credit reports.</TE>
<TE>   The program also offers, free of charge, specialized mortgages
that save workers money at the end of the loan. Workers can link home
payments to their paychecks, speeding up the repayment of their
mortgages.</TE>
<TE>   With the savings, workers are able to "get into a home for the
least amount of money," said Irma Munoz, West Coast manager of the
HIT HOME program.</TE>
<TE>   The program also offers home-buyer education and credit counselors
to those who are not yet prepared to purchase a home.</TE>
<TE>   The Los Angeles area is home to about 800,000 AFL-CIO-affiliated
union members, the second-largest labor community in the nation,
Munoz said. Fannie Mae, a congressionally chartered private company,
secures the loans made by Countrywide. The AFL-CIO then uses its
pension funds to purchase those loans.</TE>
<TE>   "We stand behind the homeowners so that the AFL-CIO can invest the
pension fund in a safe and sound manner and the homeowners can get
the best possible rate and terms," said Ted Chandler, Fannie Mae's
vice president of housing and community development for the western
U.S.</TE>

<LD>A Ventura woman who schemed to steal thousands of dollars from her
employer has been convicted of eight fraud and theft charges,
authorities said.</LD>
<LD>   Katherine A. Bordeaux, 38, was a bookkeeper for Ventura-based
Intercontinental Realty when she used two schemes to steal more than
$191,000 from the real estate management company, Dist. Atty. Michael
D. Bradbury's office said Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   Bordeaux pleaded guilty to stealing cash deposits made to the
company and to forging electronic signatures on checks she wrote to
herself, Assistant Dist. Atty. Howard Wise said.</LD>
<TE>   Superior Court Judge Edward Brodie this week accepted Bordeaux's
guilty pleas on two counts of grand theft, one count of forgery, one
count of fraudulent use of a computer to obtain property, one count
of money laundering and three counts of filing a false tax return.</TE>
<TE>   Sentencing is scheduled for Aug. 14. Bordeaux faces a maximum
penalty of up to four years in state prison.</TE>

<HD>Orange County Weighs Sewage Treatment Plans</HD>
<DH>Environment: Plants costing $270 million may take 11 years
to build. District seeks a shield from fines in the interim after it
decides not to seek a waiver extension.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SEEMA MEHTA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In the wake of a historic decision to begin more intensive treatment
of local waste water, engineers at the Orange County Sanitation
District began working in earnest Thursday on plans for two
facilities estimated to cost $270 million and take as long as 11
years to build.</LD>
<LD>   Attorneys for the Fountain Valley-based agency were also preparing
for negotiations with state and federal authorities to shield it from
penalties as it gives up its federal waiver allowing it to pump
moderately treated sewage about four miles off Huntington Beach.</LD>
<LD>   The district considered seeking a renewal of its waiver to the
U.S. Clean Water Act until Wednesday night, when a campaign by
environmental activists--concerned about repeated closures of
polluted beaches--persuaded 13 of the district's 25 board members to
vote to treat O.C. sewage to the same levels as nearly all of the
nation's 16,000 other sanitation agencies.</LD>
<TE>   More immediately, state water officials are scheduled to decide
today whether to allow the district to chlorinate the 243 million
gallons it discharges daily. Chlorination had been proposed earlier
this year after a plume of the discharged sewage migrated back to
within half a mile of Newport Beach.</TE>
<TE>   "We've got work to do," said Blake Anderson, general manager of
the sanitation agency, which serves more than 2.7 million residents
and businesses in northern and central Orange County.</TE>
<TE>   Environmentalists were euphoric Thursday. They had prevailed over
some business leaders and local officials who contended that the cost
of additional treatment was too great and its impact on coastal water
quality unknown.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a start," said Jan Vandersloot, founder of the Ocean
Outfall Group, which conducted a city-by-city campaign to kill the
waiver. "It's not ended; it's a very good beginning."</TE>
<TE>   The higher standards will require building sewage treatment plants
in Fountain Valley and Huntington Beach. Currently, only half the
discharged waste water receives treatment to remove most microscopic
solids and bacteria, viruses and other pathogens.</TE>
<TE>   Initially, the district estimated greater treatment could cost as
much as $400 million, but revised that figure downward this spring.
Most residents would pay an average of $16 more annually for the new
facilities; businesses could pay significantly more, depending on the
amount of sewage generated.</TE>
<TE>   The district is studying which technology to employ.</TE>
<TE>   The conventional method involves bacteria, contained in sludge,
that eat the solids and reduce the amount of oxygen used. "It's like
billions and billions of little PacMen consuming the dissolved
material in wastewater," Anderson said.</TE>
<TE>   He said the district will explore micro-filtration and other
techniques, and decide upon a method within two years. An independent
panel of sanitary engineers will review the district's schedules and
timelines, he said.</TE>
<TE>   One fear that almost derailed the vote to abandon the waiver was
raised late Wednesday by agency attorneys. They said that without a
waiver in place once the current one expires next June, the district
would be violating the federal Clean Water Act until the new
facilities come on line about 2013. That could mean fines starting at
$3,000 a day, lawyers said..</TE>
<TE>   On Thursday, state and federal officials expressed optimism that
all parties could reach an agreement that would shield the district
from penalties.</TE>
<TE>   "They're stepping up and doing the right thing," said Kurt
Berchtold, assistant executive officer of the Santa Ana Regional
Water Quality Control Board.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think anyone's going to try and penalize them for that,"
Berchtold said.</TE>

<HD>College District's Interim Chief Aims to Build Trust</HD>
<DH>Ventura County: James Walker, the retired president of the
Moorpark campus, takes over while the embattled chancellor is on
leave during inquiry.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>AMANDA COVARRUBIAS and MARGARET TALEV</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The newly appointed acting chief of Ventura County's Community
College District promised Thursday to restore public confidence as
the district investigates charges of overspending by Chancellor
Philip Westin.</LD>
<LD>   "My job is to get us back to what we're all about," James Walker
said as he settled into a temporary office at district headquarters
in Camarillo.</LD>
<LD>   The 66-year-old Walker was installed as acting chancellor
Thursday, two days after Westin was placed on administrative leave.</LD>
<TE>   Board President Norman Nagel said Walker will bring stability to
the troubled district, which has been pummeled by allegations that
Westin misspent tens of thousands of taxpayer dollars on meals,
travel, computers, auto repairs and improper contracts.</TE>
<TE>   "We all feel we need to reach out to the public and show the
community college system is still a viable entity," Nagel said.</TE>
<TE>   Walker retired July 1 after 10 years as president of Moorpark
College, but he barely had a chance to relax before he was back in a
suit and button-down shirt.</TE>
<TE>   In a touch more about symbolism than style, he chose a garish
necktie depicting scattered jigsaw shapes. "I'm here," he explained,
"to help sort out the puzzle."</TE>
<TE>   "If I'm a parent out there, I'd hope they would not discourage any
of their youngsters from attending any one of the [district's] three
colleges," Walker said of the recent controversies. "What goes on in
the classroom is really separate from what happens in the political
arena. It's also important I restore the confidence of the people who
work in this district."</TE>
<TE>   Trustees voted unanimously to appoint Walker to lead the district,
which includes Ventura and Oxnard colleges, while they investigate
the expenses submitted by Westin over the last six years.</TE>
<TE>   Some of the allegations about Westin's spending were contained in
a report presented to trustees in March by the Camarillo law firm of
Wood &amp; Bender. Others emerged this week in a Superior Court lawsuit
filed on behalf of county taxpayers by the Ventura firm of Benton,
Orr, Duval &amp; Buckingham.</TE>
<TE>   Westin, who was unavailable for comment Thursday, has acknowledged
poor judgment on some purchases but has denied violating any laws or
district policy and has repeatedly said he would not resign. He has
also questioned the motives of his critics.</TE>
<TE>   Since allegations surfaced in March, trustees have flip-flopped
regarding their support for Westin. They first sought his
resignation, then voted 4 to 1 in May to raise his salary 16% to
$203,000 and extend his contract through 2006. The contract also
guarantees him a $305,000 buyout if he is removed from his job
without cause.</TE>
<TE>   After a public outcry erupted, trustees voted earlier this week to
place Westin on paid administrative leave until further notice.</TE>

<HD>U.S. Values Will Be on Trial With Moussaoui</HD>
<DH>Justice is crucial even for a lunatic filled with hate.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JONATHAN TURLEY</AU>
<BD>Jonathan Turley is a constitutional law professor at
George Washington University and has served as counsel in national
security and espionage cases.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It is not something that you often see in the conservative federal
courts of Virginia: a fanatic screaming a confession that a federal
judge does not want to hear. Yet, in some ways, it was just another
day in the trial of Zacarias Moussaoui.</LD>
<LD>   Since his arrest, the "20th hijacker" suspect has turned his
courtroom into the theater of the bizarre. On Thursday, Moussaoui
held his most riveting performance yet by insisting that he wanted to
plead guilty and confess to everything short of the Lincoln
assassination. Moussaoui not only confessed to being the 20th
hijacker on Sept. 11 but proclaimed his allegiance to Osama bin
Laden. Even the most patient and committed legal system would be
forgiven if it simply took Moussaoui at his word and quickly
dispatched him to his maker. However, Moussaoui's conduct should only
reinforce the need to satisfy justice on our terms and not his.</LD>
<LD>   While U.S. District Judge Leonie Brinkema struggled to prevent him
from making further incriminating statements that are fully
admissible at trial, Moussaoui insisted that he was guilty and wanted
to proceed to the penalty stage of his capital-punishment case.</LD>
<TE>   Moussaoui's "confession," however, came only after Brinkema
rejected motions that he insisted were necessary to prove his
innocence. In the very same hearing, Moussaoui proclaimed his
innocence (as he has since his arrest) and confessed in a peevish
fit. He has refused to admit that he is clueless about how to defend
himself and has repeatedly made petulant, childlike outbursts, saying
"I don't have to take advice from you regarding the way I defend
myself." He has fought to enter nonsense pleas and then screamed that
Brinkema was preventing him "from entering the plea that I wanted."</TE>
<TE>   These hearings have shown beyond reasonable doubt that Moussaoui
is an ignorant, offensive, sexist, deranged, anti-Semitic fanatic.
Still, he may be innocent.</TE>
<TE>   Crimes require not only evil intent (which Moussaoui easily
possesses) but evil acts. The actual case against Moussaoui is
extremely thin and circumstantial. He does not fit the pattern of any
of the other hijackers and cannot be tied to any of the preparations
for the attacks. He could very well be a simple terrorist wannabe who
has found himself on a world stage where he can rant about casting
non-Muslims "into the fire" and killing Jews.</TE>
<TE>   We could very well be enabling the performance of a
self-destructive paranoid; a deranged loser who could not even
qualify as a suicide bomber.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, it would be easy to view this as a win-win proposition:
Moussaoui wants to be a martyr and few of us would mourn his passing.
However, the question is not Moussaoui's expectations of justice but
our own.</TE>
<TE>   Moussaoui represents a difficult case for the limits of
self-representation. An individual has a constitutional right to
defend himself, and the Constitution does not protect someone from
self-inflicted wounds.</TE>
<TE>   There was good reason for Brinkema to find that Moussaoui was
legally competent to be his own lawyer. However, since that finding,
Moussaoui has appeared increasingly unhinged and disturbed in his
filings and statements. His legal motions are often little more than
ravings, bearing titles such as "Zacarias Moussaoui Muslim v. U.S.
Godless government" or "Motion to see what the scam is about." He has
demanded hearings on such subjects as "those Jews who incurred the
curse of Allah and his wrath and those who He transformed into monkey
and swines." He has ranted about a fan left in his car and how "it
must be forensically examine [sic] before they kill me."</TE>
<TE>   Moussaoui's obvious instability has become an embarrassment.
However, prosecutors have studiously tried to ignore the fact that
Moussaoui is a barking lunatic.</TE>
<TE>   Some hearings have had the feel of a small family trying to ignore
an uncle in the parlor who is chewing the rug. The problem for the
government is that, if Moussaoui is found incompetent, it would
undermine his competence to stand trial or, in the very least, his
status for the death penalty.</TE>
<TE>   Brinkema was already moving to reconsider her decision on
competence before Moussaoui's latest outburst. Moussaoui refused to
submit, stating that it would be "crazy to see your Dr.
Frankenstein." That should have given Brinkema sufficient grounds to
compel evaluation and, if necessary, presume incompetence until an
evaluation is completed to the court's satisfaction.</TE>
<TE>   Ultimately, justice is defined by restraint. It is the restraint
exercised over mob and arbitrary forms of justice. It is the
restraint that affords presumptions of innocence for the least
popular or least deserving defendant. It is the restraint that is
tested every day by Moussaoui.</TE>
<TE>   However, trials are never about the defendant exclusively. They
are a measure of the society that claims the right to hold and punish
those who violate the law.</TE>
<TE>   Moussaoui may be a terrorist, but that is more the reason not to
cooperate with him in a mockery of justice.</TE>

<HD>Heroes and Demons and Just Humans</HD>
<DH>Judge the Talib and the patriot as people, not parables.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NORAH VINCENT</AU>
<BD>Norah Vincent is a senior fellow at the Foundation for
the Defense of Democracies, a think tank set up after Sept. 11 to
study terrorism.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Americans love a morality tale, especially one that's been taken from
real life. We like facile categories of good and bad, and we like
creating fiery male leads to drop neatly into them.</LD>
<LD>   That's why the drama now unfolding before us regarding 21-year-old
American Talib John Walker Lindh and 25-year-old
football-star-turned-Army-recruit Pat Tillman could have been written
for the screen by Tom Clancy.</LD>
<LD>   You can almost see the movie now. Idealistic but troubled teenager
raised in a too-permissive home in a morally questionable part of
limousine-liberal California sets out for Central Asia to find God,
ends up a ragtag foot soldier in a terrorist army. After months of
combat, the traitorous ruffian (who now uncannily resembles Charles
Manson) comes face to face with our hero, the uber patriot, a
scrubbed, All-American football great from respectably Republican
Arizona who has given up millions on the professional gridiron to
fight a virtuous war in the badlands of Afghanistan.</LD>
<TE>   In a way, it's too bad that Lindh's plea bargain stipulates that
he cannot profit from telling his story, because you can bet that
somebody else will, and handsomely.</TE>
<TE>   For now, however, we in the media will be content to mythologize
both young men for the sake of the battle of wits and morals we've
come to know as the culture wars.</TE>
<TE>   Opinion mongers haven't missed a beat. Liberals and conservatives
have been taking full partisan advantage of every new development in
the war on terror, a war that in the last few months has become a
philosophical football at home.</TE>
<TE>   Practically as soon as the towers hit the ground on Sept. 11,
pundits of the left like Noam Chomsky and Susan Sontag took advantage
of the debacle to trumpet anew their ingrained distaste for American
foreign policy.</TE>
<TE>   The most energetic mental war we're fighting is a civil one
consisting mostly of unctuous invective and tacky symbolism co-opted
for opportunistic mudslinging across the political divide.</TE>
<TE>   The conservatives are no better. They give as good as they get,
and the mythologizing of Tillman and Lindh is a prime example of
their sniping tomfoolery at work.</TE>
<TE>   In December, when Lindh was captured in Afghanistan, the
conservative press bruited the damning details with gleeful
opportunism. The cover of the New York Post stamped him "The Rat."
Meanwhile, in the Wall Street Journal, Shelby Steele was quick to
shovel the conservative consensus on the kid. "I believe a certain
cultural liberalism cleared the way for this strange odyssey of true
belief.... Walker came out of a self-hating stream of American life.
Yes, alone in Yemen and later in Pakistan, he may have been seduced
by charismatic people. But he was prepared for this seduction not
just by the wispy relativism of Marin County, but also by a much
broader post-'60s cultural liberalism (more than political
liberalism) that gave his every step toward treason a feel of
authenticity and authority."</TE>
<TE>   Coincident with Lindh's plea bargain this week, former Ronald
Reagan speechwriter Peggy Noonan penned a propagandistic enshrinement
of Tillman worthy of her former occupation. Where else but in the
Wall Street Journal? "We are making a lot of Tillmans in America, and
one wonders if this has been sufficiently noted.... Some very
talented young men, and women, are joining the armed forces to help
their country because, apparently, they love it. After what our
society and culture have become the past 30 years, you wouldn't be
sure that we'd still be making their kind, but we are."</TE>
<TE>   Like most Americans, I admire Tillman's sacrifice and loathe
Lindh's betrayal, but let's not make a parable out of either one of
them.</TE>
<TE>   Lindh is a messed-up kid who made foolish decisions, as all young
people do in search of ideals. Yes, he committed crimes, and he will
be duly punished for them. But liberalism wasn't the cause of his
demise.</TE>
<TE>   Likewise, Tillman is no god or Hercules, much less a sparkling
jewel of rectitude forged in the salty bowels of family values. He's
an individual who chooses, for his own reasons, to fight for his
country.</TE>
<TE>   Let's leave it at that, and stop making hyperbolic giants and
dwarfs out of mortals.</TE>

<HD>U.S. Drops Bomb as Two Afghan Factions Clash</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>KABUL, Afghanistan</DL>
<LD>A U.S. jet dropped a bomb as a show of force Thursday after Afghan
troops swooped into an area of eastern Afghanistan in a raid that
left a warlord's brother dead, U.S. and Afghan officials said.</LD>
<LD>   Haji Zaher, a military commander in Nangarhar province and son of
the country's recently assassinated vice president, said "renegade
Taliban members" planned to attack two villages in southern Nangarhar
but Afghan troops intervened.</LD>
<LD>   A U.S. military spokeswoman, Capt. Christa D'Andrea, said U.S.
Special Forces troops south of Jalalabad observed the firefight
between two Afghan groups but did not get involved.</LD>
<TE>   As "a show of force," however, an A-10 bomber dropped a 500-pound
bomb in an uninhabited area near the fighting.</TE>
<TE>   One Afghan died and six were wounded in the clash but none of the
casualties came as a result of the U.S. bomb, she said.</TE>
<TE>   Zaher blamed Maulvi Noor Mohammed, a local warlord, for starting
the clash, and said that "in this battle, his brother was killed."</TE>
<TE>   Zaher is a son of former Afghan Vice President Haji Abdul Qadir,
who was gunned down July 6 near his office.</TE>
<TE>   The main Afghan army commander in Nangarhar, Hazrat Ali, confirmed
the raid and said that there was "Al Qaeda activity" in the area.</TE>
<TE>   However, independent sources contacted in Jalalabad said the
incident had nothing to do with the terrorist group but followed an
attempt by Ali to disarm residents in the area. They resisted, and a
gun battle broke out.</TE>
<TE>   Afghan President Hamid Karzai has appointed no successor to Qadir
as governor of the strategic province, and a number of Afghans had
expressed fears of factional fighting as armed groups jockey for
position now that the longtime leader of Nangarhar is dead.</TE>
<TE>   Also on Thursday, U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan advocated
expanding the international security force now confined to Kabul.</TE>
<TE>   He said Wednesday that "a limited expansion" of the 4,500-strong
force to areas outside the Afghan capital "would make a huge
contribution to the consolidation of peace, and should be
considered."</TE>
<TE>   Karzai urged the U.N. Security Council to expand the force
throughout the country in February. Annan backed Karzai, but the
15-member council has repeatedly refused.</TE>

<HD>2 Youths Held in Australia Seek Asylum After Escape</HD>
<DH>Immigration: The British Consulate, however, rejects their
request and hands the brothers, who say they are Afghans, over to
local authorities.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD C. PADDOCK</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SINGAPORE</DL>
<LD>Two young brothers who escaped from a detention center in central
Australia after spending 18 months behind bars walked into the
British Consulate in Melbourne on Thursday and applied for asylum.</LD>
<LD>   Hours later, however, British Foreign Minister Jack Straw refused
to accept their application and British officials handed the boys,
ages 12 and 14, over to Australian authorities, attorneys for the
family said.</LD>
<LD>   The sudden turn of events further complicates an already complex
family saga in which the boys' father, Ali Asqar Bakhtiari, was
granted entry into Australia as an Afghan refugee but the rest of the
family members--who arrived after he did--were denied asylum and
incarcerated at the Woomera detention center.</LD>
<TE>   The brothers, Alamdar, 14, and Montazar, 12, were among 35
detainees who escaped from Woomera on June 27 when activists used a
car to pull down a section of the facility's fence. In March, dozens
of Woomera detainees also escaped after a fence was knocked down.</TE>
<TE>   A majority of the escapees were caught, but the brothers were part
of a small group that eluded pursuers in the outback. Apparently with
the help of supporters, the boys eventually made their way to
Melbourne, about 620 miles southeast of Woomera.</TE>
<TE>   Wearing baseball caps and backpacks, they arrived at the British
Consulate with an unidentified woman who left them there. Television
footage showing the brothers inside the consulate was broadcast
around the world.</TE>
<TE>   Australia incarcerates all asylum seekers, including children,
until their claims are processed. Some children have been held for
years as they waited.</TE>
<TE>   The Bakhtiari brothers had been so depressed in custody that the
detention center staff had feared for their safety. At one point,
Alamdar carved the word "Freedom" into his arm with a razor blade.
Montazar threatened to kill himself.</TE>
<TE>   "It's exactly like a prison," Alamdar told The Times in March
during a telephone interview from Woomera. "It's impossible to live
in this camp."</TE>
<TE>   Eric Vadarlis, an attorney representing the boys, criticized the
British government's decision not to consider their asylum
application. He charged that by doing so Britain had endorsed
Australia's policy of "locking up children who have done nothing
wrong."</TE>
<TE>   The Bakhtiari family's case is unusual because Ali was granted
permission to live in Australia in August 2000 while his wife, Roqia,
and their five children were denied asylum when they arrived on Jan.
1, 2001.</TE>
<TE>   The official who heard Ali's case accepted his explanation that he
was an Afghan farmer who fled his homeland after he was arrested by
the Taliban. The official who considered Roqia's application
concluded that she was from Pakistan because she did not know enough
about life in Afghanistan, including the currency and geography.</TE>
<TE>   She said in an earlier telephone interview that she had been
unable to answer such questions because, as a woman in the
restrictive Afghan society, she had never seen money or left her
village until she fled the country.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier this year, Immigration Minister Philip Ruddock denied a
request to release Roqia and the children on humanitarian grounds. He
insists that Australian law does not provide for asylum seekers'
families to be reunited.</TE>
<TE>   Lawyers for the family have filed suit, contending that Roqia and
the children should be freed because they are part of Ali's family
unit. Australia's high court will hear the case in September.</TE>
<TE>   The government has responded by seeking to remove Ali's protective
visa on the grounds that anonymous witnesses say he is a plumber from
Pakistan.</TE>
<TE>   "In our view they are Pakistani, not Afghani," Ruddock told
reporters Thursday in Sydney, adding it was inappropriate that Ali
had received a visa in the first place.</TE>
<TE>   Ali has countered with named witnesses who corroborate his account
and say they knew him in Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   By escaping from Woomera, however, the boys might have provided
the government with sufficient cause to deport them, even if the rest
of the family is granted protection by the high court. Under
Australian law, detainees who are convicted of escaping from custody
can be denied asylum even if they are otherwise qualified.</TE>
<TE>   Before Britain's refusal to hear the boys' application, Vadarlis
described them as "very, very scared."</TE>
<TE>   "They know if they step outside the consulate, the police will
lock them up," he told reporters. "It's a terrible situation."</TE>

official, drew criticism from the nation's Christian Liberation
Front, which lobbies for the interests of the small Christian
community.</TE>
<TE>   "We think justice has not been done in the case of Anwar Keneth,"
said Khalid Gill, a leader and spokesman for the group. "Keneth
should have been treated at a mental hospital."</TE>

<LD>   Senior Kazakh opposition leader Mukhtar Ablyazov was sentenced to
six years in prison for abuse of office while he was energy minister,
adding to concerns of a clampdown on opposition in the country.</LD>
<TE>   The sentence was the latest in a series of events that have led
human rights observers and foreign governments to conclude that
opposition and free speech are at risk in the country.</TE>
<TE>   Ablyazov was found guilty of inflicting $3.6 million in damage on
the state by "illegal entrepreneurial activity and abuse of power"
when he headed the Central Asian nation's power grid and Energy
Ministry from 1997 to 1999.</TE>

<LD>   Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad's ruling party split a by-election
with Muslim fundamentalists who want to declare Malaysia a hard-line
Islamic state.</LD>
<TE>   The archrivals were contesting the state assembly and national
Parliament seats that came open after the death last month of Fadzil
Noor, leader of the Pan-Malaysian Islamic Party, or PAS.</TE>
<TE>   The fundamentalists retained the assembly seat and built an early,
2,000-vote lead for the parliamentary seat. But Mahathir's ruling
United Malays National Organization party pulled ahead.</TE>
<TE>   The PAS demanded a recount, which confirmed that the ruling party
had won the parliamentary seat by 283 votes out of 45,730 cast.</TE>

<HD>5 Israelis Suspected of Selling Ammunition to Palestinians</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>JERUSALEM</DL>
<LD>Five Israelis remained in custody on suspicion of selling thousands
of rounds of ammunition to Palestinian militants, Israeli police said
Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   Two of the six people originally detained live in Adora, a Jewish
settlement in the West Bank, and their arrests shocked the small
community. Adora was the scene of a shooting by Palestinian gunmen
May 27 that killed four people, including a 5-year-old girl.</LD>
<LD>   Although it is not unheard of for soldiers to sell stolen gear to
Jewish and Arab criminals, it is rare for Jewish settlers to help arm
Palestinians who have targeted the settlers for attack.</LD>
<TE>   The Adora residents are Roi Amar, a soldier, and Oded Mulai, a
civilian, police spokesman Gil Kleiman said. Amar's brother Sela,
also a soldier, was arrested by military police but released on a
legal technicality, the spokesman said.</TE>
<TE>   Israeli newspaper and radio reports said the men allegedly stole
crates of rifle ammunition from the army and sold them during the
last three years to a Palestinian member of the Tanzim militia.</TE>
<TE>   Kleiman said a Palestinian suspect from the West Bank village of
Tarqumiya was under arrest.</TE>
<TE>   Brothers Moshe and Nadav Cohen, also soldiers, from the
neighboring settlement of Telem, and a sixth suspect, Kobi Uliel, a
reserve major from southern Israel, were taken into custody Tuesday
on suspicion of being part of the ring.</TE>
<TE>   "We're in confusion and shock," Telem resident Gideon Mizrachi
told Israel Radio. "Not just we on the settlement but the whole
Israeli people, I think, is struck with disbelief."</TE>

<HD>Scientist Is Elected India's President</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>NEW DELHI</DL>
<LD>A missile scientist who advocates nuclear weapons as a war deterrent
was elected India's ceremonial president Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   A.P.J. Abdul Kalam won 89.58% of the votes cast by 4,896 members
of Parliament and state legislatures. The only other candidate was
Lakshmi Sehgal, an 87-year-old woman proposed by leftist parties.</LD>
<LD>   Although born to Muslim parents, Kalam, 71, does not describe
himself as Muslim. He reads Hindu scriptures each day and is a
vegetarian.</LD>
<TE>   Critics of Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee's Hindu nationalist
Bharatiya Janata Party, or Indian People's Party, say Kalam was
chosen to paper over the anti-Muslim image the government acquired
after sectarian violence broke out in the western state of Gujarat in
February.</TE>
<TE>   Opposition parties and human rights groups have blamed the BJP-run
state government in Gujarat of encouraging the religious violence--or
doing little to stop it. About 1,000 people, most of them Muslims,
were killed in the clashes.</TE>
<TE>   Muslims have mostly reacted with indifference to Kalam's elevation
to the presidency. He is identified with the BJP to such an extent
that no Muslim organization has welcomed his selection.</TE>
<TE>   Kalam said his scientific career prepared him for politics. The
father of India's nuclear missile program, he helped develop missiles
to carry nuclear weapons and rockets to launch satellites.</TE>
<TE>   "Unless political decisions are taken, the satellite won't be in
orbit, the missile won't reach its target, the nuclear weapon won't
be there," Kalam said.</TE>
<TE>   He will be sworn in as India's 11th president next Thursday,
replacing Kocheril Raman Narayanan, who is completing a five-year
term in office.</TE>
<TE>   Kalam, an advocate of scientific education for children, has
insisted that his presidency would not signal warlike intentions from
India.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, it would show the world that "technology is going to be
used for development of the nation," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Kalam told reporters Thursday that the alleviation of poverty and
development of rural areas are important issues for India.</TE>

<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>ROME</DL>
<LD>Dozens of Jewish graves were desecrated in a nighttime rampage
through a cemetery here, prompting condemnation Thursday from Italian
politicians and Jewish leaders.</LD>
<LD>   The culprits smashed headstones, ripped off marble Star of David
decorations and tore off parts of gravestones bearing Hebrew writing
in the Jewish section of the Verano cemetery. At least one coffin was
partially ripped open.</LD>
<LD>   In all, 34 graves were damaged. The desecration, which happened
after the cemetery closed Wednesday, was discovered Thursday by a
visitor.</LD>
<TE>   The vandalism, Deputy Prime Minister Gianfranco Fini said, "is an
infamy that provokes horror and offends the consciences of all."</TE>
<TE>   Rome's chief rabbi, Riccardo Di Segni, called the desecration a
"deep wound, a great offense, but this offense is made to the
sensitivity of all citizens of Rome."</TE>
<TE>   In a statement, a spokesman for Milan's Jewish community, Yasha
Reibman, said that "in Italy and in Europe, a new, political
anti-Semitism is growing, which uses as an alibi all that's happening
in Israel."</TE>

<HD>Arab Allies Optimistic on Bush Plan</HD>
<DH>Diplomacy: Jordan, Egypt and Saudi Arabia say they have
bridged differences with the U.S. on proposal for settling the
Mideast conflict.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SONNI EFRON and ROBIN WRIGHT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Three Arab foreign ministers said Thursday that they had found some
common ground with the Bush administration on the broad outlines of a
plan to settle the Middle East conflict within three years, but their
optimism was tempered with grave doubt that any peace plan can be
implemented on today's blood-soaked ground.</LD>
<LD>   "We feel much more positive ... that there is a commitment to the
endgame, and a time frame," Jordanian Foreign Minister Marwan Muasher
said after meetings with President Bush and Secretary of State Colin
L. Powell. Bush said "more than five times" that he was very serious
about ensuring that all sides in the conflict met their obligations,
Muasher said.</LD>
<LD>   Egyptian Foreign Minister Ahmed Maher said Egypt would be willing
to retrain Palestinian police officers to keep order in West Bank
cities--but only after Israel pulls out. Muasher said the Bush
administration expressed no objections to that offer.</LD>
<TE>   Muasher, Maher and the foreign minister of another moderate Arab
nation, Saudi Arabia, came to Washington to try to shape the
still-sketchy vision, first outlined by Bush in a June 24 speech, to
establish side-by-side Israeli and Palestinian states within three
years. Specific provisions of the plan were not released Thursday,
but Arab and U.S. officials indicated that they had set aside many of
their differences and were determined to move ahead with parallel
talks on political, security, economic and humanitarian aspects of
the crisis.</TE>
<TE>   "It's better than people might have expected, but by no means a
breakthrough," said Edward S. Walker Jr., president of the Middle
East Institute, a Washington-based study center, and a former
ambassador to the region. The agreement in principle envisions two
side-by-side states, with Israeli withdrawal to its 1967 borders, a
Palestinian capital in East Jerusalem, and some swap of contested
territories, Walker said. But it glosses over thorny differences over
the status of Palestinian Authority President Yasser Arafat and the
sequence of the steps toward peace.</TE>
<TE>   According to Muasher, the Arab diplomats discussed with Bush the
need to have Israel withdraw from the occupied territories in time to
prepare for Palestinian elections, to be held in January. He said the
administration "understands that you cannot have elections with an
occupation."</TE>
<TE>   The diplomats agreed with Bush on the need for the Arab allies to
help the Palestinians carry out reforms and put in place a security
structure that would make it possible for Israel to withdraw from the
occupied West Bank without inviting a wave of suicide bombings. But
they stressed the need for the Israelis to attend immediately to the
hunger and privation that Palestinians have suffered since the
reoccupation.</TE>
<TE>   Prince Saud al Faisal, the Saudi foreign minister, said Bush had
promised to use his influence with Israeli Prime Minister Ariel
Sharon. But in an often-expressed Arab view of the dim hopes for a
deal with the current Israeli government, Saud added: "I would be
more optimistic if Sharon were not there. In Sharon's view, a good
Arab is a dead Arab."</TE>
<TE>   However, he said that all of the Palestinian groups, including
Hamas and Islamic Jihad, that have claimed responsibility for suicide
bombings were "all working on a paper that has all the conditions
that they will subscribe to for stopping the fighting."</TE>
<TE>   Israeli Embassy spokesman Mark Regev said Israel has "agreed to
play our part" in alleviating the crisis but had cut off talks
scheduled with moderate Palestinians "while we bury our dead" from
the two suicide bombings this week.</TE>
<TE>   "When we have attacks like this--and we had two in two days--we
don't say 'business as usual,' " Regev said.</TE>
<TE>   In response to a question, Bush said: "I'm beginning to think that
every time we have a high-level meeting, something happens--it's not
coincidental. I think the enemies of peace try to send signals, try
to derail peace and try to discourage us. And ... we refuse to be
discouraged. We're going to continue to work for peace."</TE>
<TE>   The question of how to set up a Palestinian security force is just
one of the chicken-and-egg questions that is likely to face all sides
in the weeks to come.</TE>
<TE>   Regev said Israel has encouraged moderate Arab states to play a
role in helping the Palestinians control terrorists in their midst,
including training a new police force, but will not pull out without
a security structure in place.</TE>
<TE>   "Israel does not want to stay in the Palestinian cities one hour
more than we need to, but the question is whether when we leave, the
terrorist groups will once again be the law," Regev said.</TE>
<TE>   But Egypt's Maher said it would be impossible to establish any
security force until the Israelis leave.</TE>
<TE>   "We cannot help recruit and train [Palestinian police officers] if
every time we train these people the Israelis come and arrest them
because they are carrying weapons," Maher said. Nor would Egypt offer
any guarantee--other than its goodwill and prestige--that new suicide
bombers would not go forth from cities policed by Palestinians, he
said.</TE>

<HD>Schroeder Fires His Defense Minister</HD>
<DH>Germany: Rudolf Scharping's dismissal follows reports that
he had accepted questionable funds.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CAROL J. WILLIAMS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>BERLIN</DL>
<LD>Angered by yet another scandal in his Cabinet just two months before
federal elections, Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder sacked his defense
minister Thursday after German media revealed that the official had
accepted more than $72,000 in questionable payments from a public
relations firm.</LD>
<LD>   It was one embarrassment too many for Schroeder involving Rudolf
Scharping, who only escaped termination 10 months ago because the
events of Sept. 11 distracted attention from a previous controversy
that had prompted calls for his dismissal.</LD>
<LD>   Dubbed "Randy Rudi" for his courtship of Countess Kristina Pilati,
Scharping was under fire last summer for using government aircraft to
visit her on the Spanish island of Majorca while German soldiers were
preparing for hazardous duty in the Balkans.</LD>
<TE>   But the swift removal of Scharping this time might backfire
politically. Although the defense minister has long been on the outs
with the chancellor's center-left government, he is the eighth
minister to be fired during Schroeder's nearly four years in office.</TE>
<TE>   "Today has shown that the federal government is disintegrating,"
Schroeder's conservative challenger for national leadership, Bavarian
Gov. Edmund Stoiber, told journalists. "The fight between the
chancellor and the defense minister also shows the chancellor's
rapidly disappearing authority."</TE>
<TE>   Just two days earlier, Schroeder brought enough pressure to bear
on the board of Deutsche Telekom to force the departure of chief
executive Ron Sommer--a move reproached by business leaders as state
intrusion on the private sector. Because the German government is the
largest Telekom shareholder, with 43% of the privatized company's
stock, its behind-the-scenes push for a change at the top was heeded
by the board but has failed to do much for the stock's value, which
has fallen 90% from its March 2000 peak.</TE>
<TE>   Following other strategic gaffes, such as a court case Schroeder
filed over allegations that he dyes his hair, the chancellor's
eleventh-hour action to jettison Scharping could add to a mounting
impression that the opposition has him on the run.</TE>
<TE>   Scharping's latest troubles began with the disclosure Monday by
two German newspapers that he had opened a special bank account two
days before the September 1998 elections into which the firm of
Moritz Hunzinger had since deposited $72,100.</TE>
<TE>   The minister defended the payments as an advance for his
as-yet-unwritten memoirs and for speeches sponsored by the firm
before his government appointment. German officials are prohibited
from accepting compensation aside from their state salaries.</TE>
<TE>   Wednesday's issue of the weekly Stern magazine reported that
Hunzinger also represents at least one major defense contractor,
suggesting that the firm's relationship with Scharping may have
provided a cover for social occasions in which weapons manufacturers
could privately peddle their wares to the minister.</TE>
<TE>   Hunzinger has denied that any conflict of interest occurred.</TE>
<TE>   And Scharping, who called a news conference after the chancellor's
announcement of his dismissal, insisted that there was neither legal
nor moral wrongdoing.</TE>
<TE>   "I am leaving this office with my head held high and my back
straight," he told journalists before departing the Defense Ministry
podium without taking questions. He also accused Stern of making
claims that were "false and deliberately defamatory."</TE>
<TE>   Scharping was quoted in the Monday articles as saying the payments
from Hunzinger had been duly reported and all relevant taxes paid to
the government.</TE>
<TE>   A former Social Democratic Party chief and unsuccessful challenger
to Helmut Kohl for the chancellery in 1994, Scharping has long been
unpopular with German media for his aloof demeanor and clumsy
attempts at polishing his dullard image.</TE>
<TE>   The most obvious misfire occurred last summer when Scharping
allowed the glossy Bunte magazine to photograph himself and Pilati
splashing and nuzzling in Majorca, as if they were among the
vacationing celebrities usually dogged by Europe's paparazzi. Reports
this week that Scharping spent more than $27,000 at a Frankfurt
haberdashery in a single day in 1999 have added to his reputation for
misjudgments.</TE>
<TE>   Schroeder, whose Social Democrats and partners in the Greens party
are trailing Stoiber's conservatives in all polls ahead of the Sept.
22 elections, said he was asking President Johannes Rau to endorse
Scharping's dismissal.</TE>
<TE>   In a terse public statement, a beleaguered-looking Schroeder said
the defense minister was being replaced because he no longer had the
confidence of his own party.</TE>
<TE>   The chancellor said his party's parliamentary floor leader, Peter
Struck, would replace the 54-year-old Scharping as defense minister
for the remaining weeks of the government's term.</TE>

<HD>Churches in Russia Reopen Dialogue</HD>
<DH>Religion: Orthodox and Catholic officials release letters
apparently aimed at easing bitter feud.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN DANISZEWSKI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>MOSCOW</DL>
<LD>A bitter rift that emerged this year between Russia's Orthodox and
Roman Catholic churches could be easing, as senior clerics on each
side have released letters outlining their positions but appealing
for a repair of the breach.</LD>
<LD>   The frank exchange appeared to be the beginning of a formal
dialogue on the issues that have been dividing the two churches,
after months of recrimination since the Vatican announced in February
that it was establishing formal dioceses in Russia.</LD>
<LD>   The tensions have contributed to the Russian Orthodox Church's
resistance to Pope John Paul II's long-held wish to visit this nation
before the end of his papacy. They also are believed to be behind the
government's revocation of the visas of several foreign Catholic
clerics, which has led to charges that Russia is not abiding by
guarantees of freedom of religion.</LD>
<TE>   In the Orthodox Church letter, the patriarchate's external
relations department refers to a "serious wound" caused by Catholic
"proselytizing" in Russia and by the Vatican's decision to create
four Catholic dioceses on Russian territory and several new ones in
neighboring Ukraine, another former Soviet republic.</TE>
<TE>   The letter, written by Archpriest Vsevolod Chaplin, said the
creation of the dioceses indicated that the Catholic Church is
retreating from its past commitments to regard the Russian Orthodox
as a "sister church" and instead is competing against it for souls.</TE>
<TE>   "The wound is serious, and the question arises: Are those who
inflicted this wound capable of healing it?" the letter asked.</TE>
<TE>   In a response, made public this week, Catholic Archbishop Tadeusz
Kondrusiewicz made clear that he recognized the Orthodox Church as
the leading Christian denomination in Russia.</TE>
<TE>   "We are not trying to make Russia a Catholic country," he
insisted.</TE>
<TE>   "The Russian Orthodox Church has the basic mission of the
spiritual rebirth of Russia after three generations of a militantly
atheistic regime, and we hope to have fruitful cooperation with her."</TE>
<TE>   But he said Catholics have lived in Russia for centuries and
cannot be relegated to a "sealed milieu" or an "ethnic ghetto," and
the church must have the right to preach and tend to the needs of
Catholics, have normal church structures and monastic life, carry out
charitable activities and train Russian clergy "according to their
free choice."</TE>
<TE>   The eight-page Orthodox document accused the Catholics of behaving
as though the churches were two companies fighting over market share.
It said the Catholics seem to have come to Russia to take advantage
of the deep native faith at a time when seminaries are closing and
churches are being abandoned in Western Europe.</TE>
<TE>   The thrust of the Orthodox allegation has been that Catholics are
seeking to convert Russians, rather than supporting the Orthodox
Church's own programs.</TE>
<TE>   "Love and concern for the neighbor are fundamental notions in
Christian teaching. But if the Catholic Church wants to work in
Russia as if it were in a kind of vacuum, ignoring the opinion and
interests of the Orthodox, what does it imply for partnership and
dialogue?" Vsevolod wrote.</TE>
<TE>   Kondrusiewicz in his letter denied that was the case. "We are not
competing in a 'religious market,' '' he said, "and completely concur
with the words that if we were to compete in a 'religious market' it
would harm both Orthodox and Catholics."</TE>
<TE>   The Catholic prelate acknowledged that his church has received
some recent Russian converts, but said it was not through active
enticement by priests and nuns.</TE>
<TE>   "Many come to us with the words, 'Our parents were Catholics, but
for want of a Catholic church, we were christened as Orthodox. Now we
want to return to our own church,' " he said. "Such a deliberate
change of allegiance cannot be called an act of proselytism."</TE>
<TE>   There are an estimated 500,000 to 600,000 Catholics in Russia,
most of them ethnic Germans, Poles or Lithuanians who were
historically linked to the Rome-based church.</TE>

<HD>Chavez Seen as Falling Short in Efforts to Mend Rift</HD>
<DH>Venezuela: After a short-lived coup, the leader has not
kept pledge to open talks with foes, the U.S. says.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PAUL RICHTER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>A senior U.S. government official said Thursday that Venezuelan
President Hugo Chavez has failed to do enough to reach out to the
political opposition since a short-lived coup disrupted his country
three months ago.</LD>
<LD>   Otto J. Reich, assistant secretary of State for Western Hemisphere
affairs, said that in the aftermath of the April 11 coup attempt
Chavez has not kept a promise to open a new dialogue with his
domestic critics.</LD>
<LD>   "While there's been a lot of rhetoric on both sides ... we haven't
seen that taking place," Reich told an audience at the Center for
Strategic and International Studies, a think tank in Washington.
"It's incumbent on the government to reach out to the population."</LD>
<TE>   Venezuela, the third-largest oil supplier to the United States,
has remained deeply polarized since the brief coup. Chavez and his
supporters, who are concentrated primarily among the poor, are
opposed by many in the middle and upper classes, the business
community, the church, news media and other institutions.</TE>
<TE>   Many Venezuelans have been arming themselves; observers have said
another power struggle could explode at any time.</TE>
<TE>   Reich said that although both sides in Venezuela have an
obligation to work toward reconciliation, the burden on the Chavez
administration is greater because "governments have more power."</TE>
<TE>   He said the U.S. favored having the Organization of American
States act as mediator between the two sides. But Chavez has made
clear that he does not favor such a role for the group.</TE>
<TE>   Reich said the Bush administration remains "very concerned about
the situation there."</TE>
<TE>   Chavez, a fiery former military officer fond of Marxist rhetoric,
has been the administration's least favorite leader in the Western
Hemisphere, with the exception of Cuban President Fidel Castro.</TE>
<TE>   But Reich insisted that the administration continues to view
Chavez as the legitimate, democratically elected president of the
country. "We do not support coups," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Private experts said that although both sides in Venezuela have
made some gestures toward reconciliation, the gap between their
positions is so great that there appears little chance of harmony.</TE>
<TE>   "There's very little give in terms of the political dialogue,"
said Riordan Roett, director of the Western Hemisphere program at
Johns Hopkins University Nitze School of Advanced International
Studies. "I don't see any space there for any kind of rapprochement."</TE>
<TE>   Stephen Johnson, a Latin American specialist at the Heritage
Foundation, a Washington-based think tank, said that while Chavez has
been faulted for undemocratic actions, some opponents seem to prefer
the idea of replacing the Venezuelan leader with a right-wing
strongman.</TE>
<TE>   "They don't seem to understand [that democracy is] the path to
their salvation," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts said the Chavez government has sought to stay on good
terms with its American oil customers since the coup. The government
has kept the supply and price of oil relatively steady since April,
in a sign of how much its weakening economy depends on revenue from
the oil sector, the analysts said.</TE>

<HD>Foreigners Find Jobs and Risks in Promised Land</HD>
<DH>Labor: They come from Asia, Africa and Europe for work once

<DL>TEL AVIV</DL>
<LD>Four years of hard work far from home nearly ended in a shower of
shrapnel and nails for Xu Xiangxin. The Chinese immigrant worker had
just sat down to have a beer with a friend Wednesday night in this
bustling Israeli city when disaster struck.</LD>
<LD>   "I'd only drunk half my beer when there was a big explosion," Xu,
28, recalled Thursday. "That's when I passed out."</LD>
<LD>   He came to on a hospital gurney, with blood on his face and a tube
in his nose--one of dozens of people hurt when a pair of Palestinian
suicide bombers set off two explosions in rapid succession along a
shopping strip in Tel Aviv's seedy Neve Shaanan district.</LD>
<TE>   The area is popular with Tel Aviv's booming population of
foreigners. Two of the three victims killed by the bombers were
"guest workers," one Romanian, one Asian. Immigrant laborers also
made up a large portion of the about 40 people who were injured. It
was one of the worst casualty counts among foreign workers during
nearly two years of open conflict between the Israelis and
Palestinians.</TE>
<TE>   The bombings' aftermath has trained a spotlight on immigrants like
Xu, who come from countries throughout Europe, Africa and Asia in
search of better economic prospects.</TE>
<TE>   Experts estimate that Israel is home to about 300,000 workers from
abroad. They have been pouring into Israel during the last 10 years
to help the country keep up with the economic boom of the 1990s and
to take over many of the menial, low-paying jobs that used to be
filled by Palestinians. The Israeli government has restricted the
movement of Palestinians from the West Bank and Gaza Strip to keep
out the tiny minority intent on committing violence.</TE>
<TE>   Many foreigners toil in menial jobs under conditions one activist
described as scarcely fit for human beings. Yet they stay, bound by
Israeli immigration rules, desperation for money and, sometimes,
coercive practices by their employers. Others are in the country
illegally, living and working under threat of discovery and
deportation.</TE>
<TE>   Now they also fear for their lives. Five foreign workers,
including the two who died Wednesday, have been killed in the
cross-fire since December.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm afraid," said Sally Escano, 29, who moved to Tel Aviv from
the Philippines a year ago to work as a caregiver. She shook her head
as she surveyed the destruction in Neve Shaanan, near Tel Aviv's old
central bus depot, a few hours after the twin explosions went off
shortly after 10 p.m. "I'm just thinking, 'How come?' "</TE>
<TE>   Israeli authorities say the bombers' choice of target may have
been dictated by the Jewish religious calendar. Wednesday night
marked the beginning of Tisha B'Av, a traditional day of mourning for
the destruction of the ancient Jewish temples in Jerusalem and the
scattering of the Jewish people.</TE>
<TE>   Most shops and restaurants were closed in observance of the
holiday. But a handful in Neve Shaanan were open because of the
district's primarily foreign clientele--which made it a place where
the bombers, two young Palestinian men, could find victims, police
say.</TE>
<TE>   The attack shattered the fragile calm that had descended on Tel
Aviv after a month without violent incidents.</TE>
<TE>   Foreigners accounted for about half of the wounded, Tel Aviv Mayor
Ron Huldai said Thursday. Hospital officials said many appeared to be
Romanian, one of the largest groups of overseas workers in Israel.</TE>
<TE>   The real number of non-Israelis hurt in the attack is likely to be
higher than the final official tally. Witnesses told of injured
foreigners refusing medical treatment or quickly leaving the scene,
possibly because they were undocumented workers who did not want to
attract the attention of authorities.</TE>
<TE>   One man from Ghana, who was barely able to walk on his bloodied
feet, refused to allow police to put him in an ambulance, even after
officers assured him that he would not be deported, the Maariv
newspaper reported.</TE>
<TE>   "All the time we try to convince them not to be afraid in such
cases, but they are," said Hanna Zohar, who founded a Tel Aviv labor
hotline. "They don't trust" the system.</TE>
<TE>   "Somebody could be home with a wound right now," added Shanka
Rosanne, a social worker with Mesila, an aid agency for immigrant
laborers established by the municipal government three years ago. Tel
Aviv has an estimated 60,000 to 80,000 foreign workers.</TE>
<TE>   Mesila, which is near the bomb site, was ready Thursday morning
for clients seeking psychological counseling or legal assistance in
connection with the bombings. But by noon, only two people had shown
up to inquire about the nationalities of the foreign citizens who
died, Rosanne said.</TE>
<TE>   "People are afraid to come out" for fear of being taken in by
authorities, Rosanne said. "They're really terrified. There are
police all over."</TE>
<TE>   Conditions were already difficult for many foreign workers, who
are commonly found in restaurants, on construction sites and in the
homes of well-to-do Israelis. Working and living conditions can be
"very, very bad," Zohar said, "almost not [fit for] humans." Many are
trapped in a form of indentured servitude, forced to toil for a year
just to repay the loans that got them to Israel, and then another
year to make some money.</TE>
<TE>   Even if employers are abusive, foreign workers cannot quit their
jobs under Israeli law without becoming illegal immigrants. "I'm
always afraid of being deported," said Precy Manalo, 42, who has
worked illegally for two years as a housekeeper in Tel Aviv to help
put her children through college in the Philippines.</TE>
<TE>   In the past, the Israeli government has considered slashing the
number of work permits issued to foreigners. Some officials wanted to
give the jobs back to Palestinians, but that prospect seems dimmer
than ever with about 800,000 Palestinians now under virtual house
arrest in the West Bank. The Israeli defense minister said after
Wednesday's attack that plans to lift some of the military
restrictions imposed on the West Bank last month will be postponed.</TE>
<TE>   Some religious figures also have complained that the influx of
foreigners threatens Israel's Jewish identity.</TE>
<TE>   But no government reductions have been implemented, Zohar said.</TE>
<TE>   Xu, the Chinese worker, came to Israel four years ago. He is a
native of Fujian province, famous for the number of residents who go
abroad looking for work. He is one of about 1,000 Chinese workers on
a local construction project.</TE>
<TE>   Lying in the hospital after the attack, he said in Chinese that he
would continue to work in Israel once he recovers. But "I hope the
government gives me some kind of compensation" for what happened, he
added.</TE>
<TE>   Under Israeli policy, any immigrant who enters the country
legally--even if he or she later overstays the visa and remains in
Israel illegally to work--is eligible for such compensation, in the
form of pensions and medical benefits, in the event of a terrorist
attack.</TE>
<TE>   Claiming the benefits, however, is another story. For anyone who
does not speak Hebrew or English, just filling out the proper forms
can be complicated. At Mesila, there is one volunteer Chinese
translator who comes in twice a week.</TE>
<TE>   With the specter of more terrorist attacks constantly hovering,
foreign laborers need to decide for themselves whether it is safe to
come to or remain in Israel, said Huldai, the mayor.</TE>
<TE>   "We are not saying to foreigners if it's good to come to Tel Aviv
or not," he said. "They choose their destiny. They came to work; they
are free to leave. It's the same for us who are living here.</TE>
<TE>   "We are now in a time of war," Huldai said. "We will never get to
the point where we will have 100% security."</TE>

<HD>Struggling AOL Time Warner Shakes Up Top Management</HD>
<DH>Media: Robert Pittman, a key architect of merger, resigns
under pressure as firm's stock plummets.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>THOMAS S. MULLIGAN and SALLIE HOFMEISTER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>AOL Time Warner Inc., the world's largest media conglomerate, shook
up its top management ranks Thursday in an effort to breathe new life
into a hybrid company that has seen its vision for a digital future
fade as its fortunes sank.</LD>
<LD>   The latest casualty of the company's miserable stock performance
was Robert W. Pittman, who resigned under pressure as chief operating
officer of the corporation and head of the struggling Internet
flagship, America Online.</LD>
<LD>   Pittman, a college dropout who founded MTV network, had been a key
architect of the merger between Internet giant AOL and entertainment
powerhouse Time Warner. He had been touted as a potential successor
to then-Chief Executive Gerald Levin, who himself was forced out in
May.</LD>
<TE>   In the wake of upstart AOL's $99-billion purchase of venerable
Time Warner 18 months ago, Pittman, 48, has been widely blamed for
its failures: The company's stock has slid 61% this year and 78% from
its post-merger peak.</TE>
<TE>   Pittman's replacement by two veteran Time Warner executives puts
the old-media executives very much back in control and leaves
Chairman Steve Case without his closest ally.</TE>
<TE>   Richard D. Parsons, the Time Inc. veteran who took over as AOL
Time Warner chief executive in May, announced a new, two-legged
structure for the sprawling company, intended to restore some of the
autonomy stripped away by the merger.</TE>
<TE>   Don Logan, chairman and chief executive of Time Inc., will head a
new Media &amp; Communications Group consisting of America Online, Time
Inc., Time Warner Cable and the AOL Time Warner Book Group and
Interactive Video unit.</TE>
<TE>   Jeffrey Bewkes, chairman and chief executive of HBO, will run the
new Entertainment &amp; Networks Group, including HBO, New Line Cinema,
the WB Network, Turner Networks, Warner Bros. and Warner Music.</TE>
<TE>   Both executives will report directly to Parsons. And
significantly, analysts said, both men tend to let subordinates run
their operations as they see fit, providing that they produce
results.</TE>
<TE>   Unfairly or not, Pittman was most closely identified with the
company's efforts to integrate its operations by, for example,
coordinating advertising and marketing efforts across the film, TV,
music, publishing and Internet platforms. That push met increasing
resistance from the operating divisions, especially in the last year
as the advertising market has crumbled.</TE>
<TE>   The advertising downturn, which hit America Online especially
hard, helped erode Pittman's authority, analysts said.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, Thursday's moves underline the stunning reversal of
fortune that has taken place since the merger.</TE>
<TE>   When the deal was announced in January 2000, AOL was riding so
high on the crest of the Internet stock wave that it was able to
offer $163 billion worth of its shares for Time Warner, which the
stock market valued at about $100 billion, despite its having three
times as much revenue as AOL.</TE>
<TE>   The merger was presented as a way to tie Time Warner global brand
names in news and entertainment--from CNN to Time magazine to Warner
Bros. studios--to the apparently untiring growth engine of the
Internet.</TE>
<TE>   By the time the merger closed a year and a day later, its value
had shrunk to $99 billion as the frenzy for Internet stocks abated.
Still, the company's top executives continued to profess their belief
that the solid but slow-growing media properties would be
jet-propelled by the online business.</TE>
<TE>   Today, America Online is the only part of the company that is
conspicuously slumping.</TE>
<TE>   "The rest of our businesses are, frankly, shooting the lights
out," Parsons said.</TE>
<TE>   Investors are so sour on the online business, said analyst Jeffrey
Logsdon of Gerard Klauer Mattison &amp; Co., that they essentially value
America Online at zero--a development that helped lead to Levin's
resignation.</TE>
<TE>   "With $1.5 billion to $2 billion in EBITDA, America Online is
clearly worth something," Logsdon said, referring to earnings before
interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization--a favorite yardstick
for media companies. But, he added, "the market is not efficiently
valuing the Time Warner assets because of the stream of bad news and
estimate reductions coming out of AOL."</TE>
<TE>   On Thursday, for example, the Washington Post raised questions
about whether the Internet unit had improperly inflated revenue
through questionable accounting.</TE>
<TE>   The parent company denied any impropriety, but the article, and
questions about the impending management shake-up, weighed heavily on
the stock, which closed at a new 52-week low of $12.45 in trading on
the New York Stock Exchange.</TE>
<TE>   Logsdon and other analysts said that a divorce--splitting the AOL
and Time Warner properties apart again--may be the best way to get
the stock moving ahead.</TE>
<TE>   Pittman, who ran AOL alongside founder Case, will stay at the
online unit until a successor is named, the company announced.</TE>
<TE>   Parsons said Pittman's departure was of his own accord. He began
discussing it with Parsons just before the July 4 holiday, Parsons
said.</TE>
<TE>   "He'd been carrying this rock on his shoulders as long as he
could," Parsons said. "He felt he needed a break to rethink what he
wanted to do with his life."</TE>
<TE>   Several insiders said Pittman was taking the fall for hyping
expectations for the merger on Wall Street that were never delivered
upon. Said one: "Investors feel betrayed."</TE>
<TE>   One media executive said it was unfair to blame Pittman for all
the problems at AOL.</TE>
<TE>   "It may have worked if not for 9/11," he said, noting that the
stock dropped dramatically after the terrorist attacks. That created
internal unrest at AOL Time Warner, with Time Warner executives
particularly upset that their stock options were losing money.</TE>
<TE>   The backlash toward Pittman began, with division heads looking to
scuttle the top executives' synergy initiatives. "These executives
had no incentive to concentrate on synergy. They were focused on the
performance of their own division," the media executive added.</TE>
<TE>   Jessica Reif Cohen, an analyst at Merrill Lynch Global Securities,
said Pittman's departure "should help calm thing down," and added: "I
give him credit for stepping down because the instability was bad for
AOL."</TE>
<TE>   Analysts said they expected additional departures from AOL because
of the poor performance of the division and the credibility problem
the corporate culture has created on Wall Street. As a result, some
question whether Case's power base eventually will erode.</TE>
<TE>   Said one analyst: "Every top AOL executive should be gone because
of issues of credibility and aggressive accounting."</TE>
<TE>   Mulligan reported from New York, Hofmeister from Los Angeles.</TE>

<LD>Is the dream of convergence dead?</LD>
<LD>   In January 2000, America Online and Time Warner announced they
would marry, culminating a long and closely watched flirtation
between Hollywood and Silicon Valley. The idea was to combine
Internet technology with entertainment content, sell it online and
create a blockbuster new industry for the 21st century.</LD>
<LD>   Today, the dream of convergence is being shaken awake. AOL Time
Warner Inc., which bet its future on convergence, is unraveling.
Chief Executive Richard D. Parsons has ordered divisions, ranging
from movie studios to a cable operator, to focus on being the best in
their class and worry less about partnering up. Robert W. Pittman,
the company's chief operating officer and master of synergy, is out.</LD>
<TE>   Meanwhile, rivals who resisted the urge to merge are prospering.
NBC is the top-rated television network even though it is not part of
a giant media conglomerate. Yahoo Inc., once derided for failing to
merge with a major content provider, has a market value of $8
billion, while the larger America Online is valued by investors at
virtually nothing.</TE>
<TE>   "If AOL Time Warner couldn't pull this off, who can?" said Bill
Whyman, president of Precursor Group, a technology analyst in
Washington. "Convergence may not be dead, but it's still just a
vision."</TE>
<TE>   Whyman says he is particularly disappointed by the company's
failure to deliver on its promise to package music, movies and other
Time Warner entertainment and sell it online to existing customers.</TE>
<TE>   "They've got the content. They've got the software. They've got
the cable. And they've got the existing customer relationships,"
Whyman said. "In fairness to AOL, no one else has been able to do it
either. But it worries me that this whole vision about selling
subscriptions to interactive content is going to happen much later
than people thought."</TE>
<TE>   The Net hasn't turned out to be the next great distribution
pipeline for the entertainment industry, and as advertisers lost
interest in the Web, AOL wasn't alone in seeing its convergence
initiatives founder.</TE>
<TE>   Walt Disney Co. abandoned its Internet portal, Go.com, and NBC
pulled the plug on its version, NBCi. Investors have lost so much
faith in Vivendi Universal's attempt to build a converged
conglomerate that the company dumped its chief executive and is
widely expected to carve itself apart.</TE>
<TE>   Some believe AOL Time Warner's problem is that it simply is too
large.</TE>
<TE>   "There comes a time when size is a disadvantage," said Brian Seth
Hurst, head of Opportunity Management, a marketing and branding
consultant. "You can't move quickly enough. In a large organization,
everyone acts in their own self-interest."</TE>
<TE>   In the rush to maximize synergies, AOL Time Warner may have made a
classic mistake: losing sight of what customers really want.</TE>
<TE>   "Convergence is a slow process," said Frank Catalano, president of
Catalano Consulting, an Internet marketing firm. "It shouldn't be a
top-down effort. You start by taking small steps."</TE>
<TE>   The restructuring announced Thursday, which will divide the
company's divisions into two, marks a retreat from the company's
previous emphasis on cross-selling and synergies.</TE>
<TE>   For the struggling Internet unit, that probably means a return to
basics and improvements in features.</TE>
<TE>   With Microsoft's rival online service MSN taking direct aim at AOL
customers, pressure is building for AOL to unveil more eye-catching
changes.</TE>
<TE>   "AOL still has a lot of brand power and a strong cash flow," said
Jessica Reif Cohen, an analyst at Merrill Lynch Global Securities,
referring to the Internet unit. "It's still a decent business."</TE>
<TE>   Some analysts remain optimistic about the potential for marrying
entertainment and technology, but they say AOL Time Warner fell
victim to a combination of market forces and its own mistakes.</TE>
<TE>   For two years, AOL Time Warner executives boasted that the merger
was succeeding without a hitch and synergies were improving the
bottom line.</TE>
<TE>   But in recent months it has become clear that bringing together
such diverse corporate cultures was not so easy and resentments
between the two companies were much deeper than AOL Time Warner
executives revealed.</TE>
<TE>   "At AOL," Catalano said, "the business models ran into each other
and then bounced off."</TE>
<TE>   The New York-based company has enjoyed several successes in
integrating its film, music, publishing and Internet divisions.</TE>
<TE>   The Internet unit promptly became a major source of new
subscriptions to Time Inc. magazines. Heavy AOL promotions of movies
including "Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone" and "The Lord of
the Rings" helped turn those films into big moneymakers.</TE>
<TE>   But those early successes proved hard to follow.</TE>
<TE>   AOLTV, once considered the symbol of the combination of technology
and entertainment, has been a failure. The product, which attempts to
integrate the AOL service into consumers' TVs, has been panned by
critics and users.</TE>
<TE>   The company won't release subscription numbers, but analysts said
sales have been slow.</TE>
<TE>   AOL has been unable to sell AOLTV's software to any cable
operator--even its own Time Warner Cable. Although it's still trying,
another unit within the company is developing an "everything on
demand" service more likely to appeal to cable operators.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, America Online, with 30 million subscribers, has made
few inroads in selling high-speed Internet service across Time Warner
cable lines. Though most Time Warner customers can receive AOL
broadband service, fewer than 100,000 are opting to buy it, according
to estimates.</TE>
<TE>   Another problem for the corporation is that AOL's high-speed
service is taking customers away from another member of the Time
Warner family, RoadRunner, the cable division's high-speed service.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a very curious, very uncomfortable mix for a lot of people,
including internally," said Gary Arlen, an independent media and
consumer electronics analyst.</TE>
<TE>   But Michael Harris, president of Kinetic Strategies, says AOL's
ownership of the rival services gives the company a laboratory to
show that the cable industry could offer consumers a choice of
high-speed providers--a key step in AOL gaining access to other cable
operators' customers.</TE>
<TE>   "The technical argument about it not being feasible has
evaporated," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Even the promise of cross- company ad sales, which AOL Time Warner
has been promoting heavily, is falling victim to a sluggish ad market
and declining interest in the Internet.</TE>
<TE>   "Some companies are trying to get out of those deals now because
they're not getting the business," Catalano said. "The effectiveness
of Internet advertising is still experimental."</TE>
<TE>   There are, however, recent signs that the AOL Time Warner merger
is paying dividends.</TE>
<TE>   Some of the best examples of the corporation's siblings playing
nice come in the field of music. Warner Music's labels built on their
long-standing relationships with America Online and other members of
the corporate family to boost sales of several new artists.</TE>
<TE>   Jeremy Welt, head of new media at Warner's Maverick label, cited
Michelle Branch, whose debut album sold more than 1 million copies
after receiving important boosts from the WB Network and AOL.</TE>
<TE>   But the relationship between Warner Music and AOL has not been
monogamous. They routinely have looked to other partners to satisfy
individual needs, as with Maverick's first experiment with selling
MP3 files, done with a subsidiary of Vivendi Universal.</TE>
<TE>   Nor has the cooperation led to any extensive new services, such as
music by subscription, despite the enormous demand from consumers for
songs delivered online.</TE>
<TE>   Still, Paul Vidich, executive vice president of Warner Music
Group, said: "We work with AOL Music because it makes sense. AOL
Music is a strong marketing partner that delivers a significant
online audience."</TE>
<TE>   And, as Warner moves forward with its first downloadable music
sales through AOL, he said, the online service "will become a strong
commercial partner as well."</TE>

<LD>Invest for the long haul. Don't try to play market swings. Keep most
of your money in stocks because they'll beat the alternatives over
time.</LD>
<LD>   These are the rules that millions of individual investors accepted
as gospel in the 1990s. But amid the worst stock market decline in a
generation, and a severe crisis of confidence in the financial system
itself, many investors are no longer sure they believe the old rules.
It's a shift with enormous implications if it gathers momentum.</LD>
<LD>   With each drop in share prices--which fell broadly again
Thursday--some people even are questioning whether the
once-unchallenged investing tenets were a sham to begin with, a
conspiracy on the part of powerful and greedy Wall Street and
corporate interests to sucker Main Street into the biggest bubble in
market history.</LD>
<TE>   Listen to Les Greenberg, 59, a semiretired attorney and private
investor in Culver City: "There's the corporate elite and then
there's the rest of us, going to Versailles Palace and shocked by
what we see. People are realizing that a game has been played in the
financial markets."</TE>
<TE>   Or this posting from an investor on the Web site of mutual fund
tracker Morningstar Inc.: "While riding from Los Angeles up the I-5
to Stockton, you pass a section where there are thousands of cows
that will soon be slaughtered. It made me think of the millions of
honest, hard-working people 'investing' for retirement in high-cost
401(k), 403(b) plans. Most of whom will most surely be financially
slaughtered."</TE>
<TE>   Even some professional financial advisors are having second
thoughts about repeating the mantra on the long-term superiority of
stocks, and why investors should just stay put, no matter what.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know that investors feel betrayed, but I'm sure there are
a fair number that wish they didn't believe what they have always
read about investing being long-term," said Margie Mullen, a fee-only
financial planner with Mullen Advisory in Los Angeles. "Sometimes, I
wish I didn't either. I can name the people who called me a year ago,
asking if they should get out of the market--and I talked them out of
it. In hindsight, I wish I hadn't done that."</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, for many investors the market has made a mockery of the
idea of never selling stocks, especially in the case of the
technology names that had been small investors' favorites in the late
1990s. In 28 months, the tech-dominated Nasdaq composite index has
sliced through four millennium marks, from 5,000 to 2,000.</TE>
<TE>   All the way down, most Wall Street analysts exhorted investors to
hold on, or to buy more. Now, at 1,356, Nasdaq has lost a stunning
73% from its peak, the worst decline for a major market index since
the Great Depression years. And no one can guarantee that prices
won't go much lower.</TE>
<TE>   "I have lost my trust in a lot of it," Savena Skeehan, a small-
business owner in La Crescenta, said of the market. "If you are just
an average investor like I am, it feels like it's rigged."</TE>
<TE>   To be sure, this flood of emotion and doubt is viewed by many Wall
Street veterans as the strongest sign that the longest bear market
since the 1940s is nearing an end.</TE>
<TE>   But that argument has been heard for almost two months--and at
various points in the last two years. Yet the market continues to
slide. Stocks fell across the board again Thursday, with the Dow
Jones industrial average losing 132.99 points to 8,409.49, the lowest
since September.</TE>
<TE>   The broader Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index of big-name shares fell
2.7% on Thursday to a five-year low, and is down 42% from its peak.</TE>
<TE>   Even among investors who want to believe that stocks eventually
will rebound, the risk that this time might be different--or that the
"long term" might be too long to wait--is causing trepidation.</TE>
<TE>   After the market crash of 1929, it took the Dow index until 1955
to get back to the '29 peak.</TE>
<TE>   Carlos Chavarria, a criminal lawyer in Los Angeles, said that in
the last month he sold many of the stock investments he had held in
retirement accounts and shifted that money into cash accounts.</TE>
<TE>   "You like to think it's for the long term, but you don't want to
break even in the long term," said Chavarria, 45. In the past, he
said, "people thought that [the market] was going to stall and dip a
little, and then start going up again." Now, he said, "I don't think
it's going to happen for a long time."</TE>
<TE>   Chavarria said President Bush's assurances about the economy's
stability have done little to bolster his confidence about making new
stock purchases. "If it goes down, is he going to reimburse me?" he
said.</TE>
<TE>   The chilling reality for many buy-and-hold investors is that they
have made almost no money in stocks for the last five years. That may
not be the "long term" in the minds of financial advisors, but it's
long enough for some people with mortgages to pay, college expenses
to meet and retirements to fund.</TE>
<TE>   The return on the S&amp;P 500 since mid-July 1997 works out to about
1.5% a year. An investor would have been far better off buying a
five-year U.S. Treasury note in July 1997: That risk-free security
would have paid 6% a year in interest since then.</TE>
<TE>   "Our clients are not panicking, but they are getting tired," said
Judy Lau, a financial planner in Wilmington, Del. "This is different
than 1987, when the correction was sharp, quick and over before you
knew it. This is dragging on and on and on. The wall of regrets is
getting very high."</TE>
<TE>   Most investors now recognize that the late 1990s market was a
bubble of immense proportions, as technology stocks routinely doubled
and tripled in the course of a few weeks or months. But probably few
people believed that a cherished new-economy stock like computer
networker Cisco Systems could collapse as it has, from $79 at its
peak in 2000 to about $14 now.</TE>
<TE>   Worse, some small investors might have wanted to sell their
highfliers in 1999 or 2000, but nearly all of what they read from
market "experts" in the media was about holding on. No less than
Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan was still giving glowing
reviews in early 2000 to the technology-led new economy, and cheering
its potential.</TE>
<TE>   The revelations this year of massive corporate book-cooking in the
boom years, and allegations that brokerage analysts routinely skewed
their stock recommendations just to keep their corporate investment
banking clients happy, have been salt in the wounds of many investors
who have stayed with the buy-and-hold strategy.</TE>
<TE>   So Wall Street is holding its breath, fearing that Americans en
masse will turn their backs on stocks--not all at once, but over the
next few years. That could severely limit investment capital
available to U.S. companies. And if millions of people shift their
money to low-paying bank accounts or bonds, they may guarantee
themselves a much poorer retirement than they had planned.</TE>
<TE>   Yet amid the gloom, many investment advisors and individual
investors insist that it makes no sense to give up on the idea of
making money in stocks in the very long term. Buying stocks, after
all, is buying a piece of the economy. If it grows, the market should
too, over time.</TE>
<TE>   The oft-quoted number is 10.7%: That's the average annualized
return on blue-chip stocks over the last 75 years, according to data
firm Ibbotson Associates.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the plunge of the last two years, the average annual
return on blue-chip shares over the last 10 years is about 11.4%.</TE>
<TE>   Stocks still may be overvalued today, analysts allow, but even if
the return over the next 20 years averages, say, 6% a year, it will
beat the current returns on savings accounts and other safe havens.</TE>
<TE>   Financial advisors say the question for most people isn't whether
to own stocks, but how much of their money to have in the market,
given their tolerance for risk.</TE>
<TE>   "When things were rocking and rolling, we had to fight to keep
people from putting all their money in stocks; now we have to keep
them from taking all their money out," said Mark Brown, a partner at
Denver planning and investment firm Brown &amp; Tedstrom. "You definitely
see some people who were doing it all themselves, who didn't
understand that the market is risky."</TE>
<TE>   Nick von Gymnich, a 28-year-old real estate consultant in Los
Angeles, said he continues to believe that "if you invest
consistently over 30 or 40 years and you don't go out on a crazy
limb, over the long term you'll be OK. That was true over the last
100 years."</TE>
<TE>   Financial advisors say it's easy in retrospect to say people
should have sold their stock on the way down, to lock in profits or
limit losses. But even if they had, they face the agonizing decision
of when to get back in. Timing the market's swings on both ends has
proved to be impossible even for most pros.</TE>
<TE>   After the market crash of 1987, "There were a lot of people who
got really scared and got out," Lau said. "Ten years later, they were
still out--and they'd missed an incredible opportunity."</TE>
<TE>   " 'Buy low and sell high' is still the thing--but I just don't
know where the low is," said Jack Rollow, 73, an architect who works
as a consultant for the Los Angeles Unified School District.</TE>
<TE>   But if many investors sense that now is a better time to be buying
stocks for the long haul than selling, it's still difficult for them
to overcome the extremely negative psychology of the moment.</TE>
<TE>   "I was buying on the dips but I weaned myself off of it last
October or November," said Cynthia Mason, 40, a vice president at a
mortgage company in Los Angeles. "Basically I'm just riding where I
am now. I understand that when the market goes up again I'll say,
'Why didn't I buy more when it was cheap?' But it's not so easy to
do.</TE>
<TE>   "I know I should be doing that, but the market is like a big
headache at the moment, and I don't want to think about it."</TE>

<HD>N.Y.'s Bratton Applies to LAPD</HD>
<DH>Police: The former commissioner is a top candidate for
chief's job. Some question going outside the department.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TINA DAUNT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>William Bratton, the former New York City police commissioner whose
tenure with that department made him the subject of national
attention, said Thursday that he is applying for the position of Los
Angeles police chief, calling it the "most exciting and challenging
police leadership opportunity in the U.S. today."</LD>
<LD>   He joins a large field of candidates--many of them LAPD
insiders--vying for the job to replace Bernard C. Parks, who was
denied a second term by the Police Commission in April.</LD>
<LD>   "I've always been someone who goes where the opportunities are,"
Bratton said.</LD>
<TE>   Although Bratton is considered one of the top contenders for the
job, city officials say he could face opposition from those who
question whether the LAPD should be led by an outsider. In 1992, the
city ended a long tradition by hiring an outside candidate to run the
LAPD.</TE>
<TE>   Willie L. Williams was credited with helping improve the LAPD's
standing in the community--then badly damaged by the Rodney King
beating and the 1992 riots--but he was denied a second term by city
officials who concluded that he had failed to lead the department
effectively.</TE>
<TE>   Today, some city officials and residents remain wary of going
outside the department ranks again. In a Times poll conducted in
March, 61% of those questioned citywide said they want the next
police chief to come from within the LAPD, while 22% said they would
prefer an outsider.</TE>
<TE>   On Thursday, some city leaders said that they too had reservations
about choosing a candidate from outside the LAPD.</TE>
<TE>   "Bratton certainly has a very impressive record in a number of
areas," said Councilman Jack Weiss. "But here's the dilemma L.A.
faces: On the one hand, here's a national leader who can talk the
national talk in the area of criminal justice and police reform, but
can he talk Pacoima and Palms?</TE>
<TE>   Still, Weiss added that he also has concerns about whether the
LAPD's "home-grown talent" is up to the task of fixing what he and
others say are serious problems within the Police Department.</TE>
<TE>   "Are they ready to step up--from Day 1--and become national
leaders in the areas of reform, crime reduction and accountability?"
he said. "I don't think there is a consensus on the outsider versus
insider question yet."</TE>
<TE>   Today is the deadline for candidates to apply for the job. The
city has received inquiries from law enforcement officials across the
country.</TE>
<TE>   Some of those pursuing the position include: Portland, Ore.,
Police Chief Mark Kroeker, a former LAPD deputy chief who was a
finalist for the job five years ago; Oxnard Police Chief Art Lopez;
LAPD Deputy Chief David Kalish; and LAPD Cmdr. George Gascon. LAPD
Asst. Chief David Gascon, who was also a contender for the job five
years ago, also is expected to apply.</TE>
<TE>   The Police Commission is set to form a citizens group next week to
help narrow the list of candidates. From there, the Police Commission
will pick three finalists. Mayor James K. Hahn will then name the new
chief, subject to confirmation by the City Council.</TE>
<TE>   On Thursday, Hahn said he was glad that Bratton had applied for
the job, but the mayor said, as he has before, that he was not
favoring the former NYPD commissioner over any other candidate at the
moment.</TE>
<TE>   Councilwoman Cindy Miscikowski, who heads the council's Public
Safety Committee, said she too was pleased the former NYPD chief is
interested in the job, but she would not "handicap the race."</TE>
<TE>   Bratton said he is interested in the job because be wants the
challenge of fixing the Police Department, which has been tarnished
by allegations of brutality and corruption in recent years and is
under a federal court order to revamp many of its practices. While
Bratton was head of the NYPD from 1994 to 1996, serious felonies in
New York fell by 33% and the murder rate was cut in half.</TE>
<TE>   Bratton--who also has led Boston's police department--emphasized
the importance of deploying officers closer to the community in small
precincts and using modern technology to help identify high-crime hot
spots throughout New York. The use of crime statistics and computer
mapping by the NYPD under Bratton was widely emulated nationally by
other police departments, including the LAPD.</TE>
<TE>   As crime dropped in New York, the Police Department there
attracted attention and brought Bratton and Mayor Rudy Giuliani into
conflict as the two each claimed credit.</TE>
<TE>   After two years, Bratton resigned and went to work as a
consultant, advising police departments around the world on how to
fight crime.</TE>
<TE>   It was through his work with Kroll Associates--assigned to monitor
the LAPD's progress in complying with federally mandated
reforms--that Bratton became interested in the Los Angeles chief's
position.</TE>

<HD>Davis, Simon Call for State Alert System on Abductions</HD>
<DH>Emergencies: The gubernatorial candidates seek immediate
action to aid in publicizing crimes.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MATEA GOLD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>PALO ALTO</DL>
<LD>Decrying the kidnapping and murder of a 5-year-old Stanton girl, Gov.
Gray Davis and his Republican challenger, Bill Simon Jr., both said
Thursday that they support a statewide alert system that would
broadcast information about abductions immediately after they occur.</LD>
<LD>   Other states currently use the Amber alert system, named after a
9-year-old Texas girl who was kidnapped and murdered in 1996, to send
out emergency alerts over the broadcast media about kidnapping
suspects. An emergency system now operated by California's Office of
Emergency Services provides information statewide through e-mail and
pagers for events such as power failures.</LD>
<LD>   Law enforcement agencies in 12 counties--including Orange County,
where Samantha Runnion lived--have volunteered to use the system to
send information about crimes to the media.</LD>
<TE>   During a news conference in Burlingame, Davis said he had spoken
to Assemblyman George Runner (R-Lancaster) about amending legislation
he has written to require all 58 counties to provide the alert to
broadcasters. Davis said he hoped to sign a bill on the matter before
Sept. 1.</TE>
<TE>   "We do have a voluntary program up to date," the governor said.
"We want to make this as mandatory as we can, consistent with the 1st
Amendment, to have this information available.</TE>
<TE>   "Information needs to get out in the first five to seven hours,"
he added. "That is the best chance to save a little girl or little
boy who may be kidnapped."</TE>
<TE>   Later in the afternoon, Simon called on the governor to issue an
executive order that would direct the Office of Emergency Services to
work with the U.S. Department of Justice and state agencies to
develop a system that would tie together local law enforcement
agencies and news outlets.</TE>
<TE>   "We should not have to wait for the legislative process to give us
the Amber alert system in California," Simon said during a news
conference in Palo Alto. "A system like this will allow for local
entities to jump to immediate action, based upon the report of an
abducted child, and give the citizens in those communities the
opportunity to mobilize, therefore increasing the chances of finding
an abducted child alive."</TE>
<TE>   Russ Lopez, a spokesman for Davis, said that the state could not
order the participation of local agencies.</TE>
<TE>   Both candidates spent the day in the Bay Area, touting their
endorsements. The governor appeared with 50 members of the California
Coalition of Law Enforcement Assns., an organization that represents
80,000 sworn officers. Wayne Quint, president of the group, said

<HD>2 Inglewood Officers Plead Not Guilty to Felony Counts</HD>
<DH>Courts: Policemen may face three-year prison terms after
grand jury indicts them. The lawyer for one says new surveillance
video could help clear his client.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Two Inglewood police officers pleaded not guilty Thursday to felony
charges in the videotaped beating of a 16-year-old who was slammed
onto the trunk of a squad car and punched in the face.</LD>
<LD>   Later in the day, county prosecutors decided they will not file
charges against the boy, Donovan Jackson, who sheriff's deputies said
refused to follow their orders while they were citing his father at a
gas station for expired registration tags.</LD>
<LD>   Jeremy J. Morse and his partner, Bijan Darvish, entered their
pleas in Los Angeles County Superior Court after their indictment
Wednesday by the county grand jury in connection with the July 6
incident. The indictment, unsealed Thursday morning in the downtown
courtroom, charges Morse with assault under the color of authority
and Darvish with filing a false police report. Both charges carry
possible three-year prison sentences.</LD>
<TE>   The Los Angeles County district attorney's office is still
reviewing the citation issued by sheriff's deputies to Jackson's
father, Coby Chavis, for driving with a suspended license and with
expired registration tags, authorities said. The Los Angeles County
Sheriff's Department had referred the cases against Chavis and
Jackson to county prosecutors for possible criminal filings.</TE>
<TE>   Judge Dan Oki said at the arraignment hearing for the two officers
that the case would be transferred to Inglewood, where the beating
occurred.</TE>
<TE>   A videotape of the incident, taken by a man staying in a hotel
across the street, sparked a public outcry over alleged police
brutality and racial profiling. Asked whether he would seek a change
of venue, Morse's attorney, John Barnett, said he would analyze
whether his client could receive a fair trial in Inglewood.</TE>
<TE>   Barnett insisted Thursday that a gas station surveillance tape,
which has not been made public, shows a more complete version of the
incident that could help clear his client of the assault charge.</TE>
<TE>   Darvish, according to sources close to the case, was indicted
because he failed to include in his police report that Jackson was
thrown onto the trunk of the patrol car, as seen in the now-infamous
video. Darvish's attorney countered Thursday that there was nothing
false in the report.</TE>
<TE>   The indictments drew mixed reaction in Inglewood and throughout
the state.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Los Angeles) said she was pleased that
the officers were indicted by the grand jury but that she wants two
other Inglewood officers who were at the scene to be disciplined.
Such action, Waters said, would help to change the culture in the
Inglewood Police Department, which she said allows officers to
protect one another.</TE>
<TE>   She also praised the swift response by the district attorney's
office, saying the community needed a quick resolution.</TE>
<TE>   "I think when there is swift action on police abuse incidents that
it gives the people of the area more confidence in the justice
system," Waters said.</TE>
<TE>   Waters also said she remains concerned about the role of two
sheriff's deputies in the incident.</TE>
<TE>   "They initially got involved in stopping Mr. Chavis even though it
was out of their area," Waters said. "They were the ones that kind of
triggered this whole thing."</TE>
<TE>   Sheriff's officials, who acknowledged that the deputies questioned
Chavis in territory patrolled by Inglewood police, said they are not
aware of any wrongdoing on the part of the deputies.</TE>
<TE>   Inglewood Police Assn. President Neil Murray said he was
disappointed but not surprised by the indictments. "This is a very,
very sad day," he said. "Two of our brothers have been accused of
committing a crime that we don't believe they committed."</TE>
<TE>   Johnnie L. Cochran Jr., the attorney representing Jackson and his
mother, predicted that the defense attorneys will have a difficult
time winning the case. "Nothing is going to clear his client. He will
never be able to explain a 16-year-old in custody ... slammed" into a
police car, Cochran said.</TE>
<TE>   During the brief arraignment hearing, Oki read the charges aloud
and asked the officers how they pleaded. Morse and Darvish, both
wearing dark suits and standing next to their attorneys, responded,
"Not guilty, your honor."</TE>
<TE>   Oki set bail for each defendant at $25,000 and gave both until
4:30 p.m. to post $2,500 bond with the court, but then extended that
until this afternoon because of a paperwork problem. Morse and
Darvish were booked and photographed on the 16th floor of the
courthouse and released on their own recognizance, authorities said.</TE>
<TE>   Morse, 24, and Darvish, 25, are scheduled to appear at the
Inglewood courthouse on Aug. 13 for pretrial motions and to set a
trial date.</TE>
<TE>   Morse was charged with hitting Jackson after arriving at the gas
station where a sheriff's deputy had approached Chavis to check on
his registration tags.</TE>
<TE>   According to a sheriff's report, a struggle ensued with a deputy
when Jackson ignored their commands. Darvish, in his report, said he
and Morse assisted the deputies in controlling Jackson. Darvish said
he struck Jackson twice before he was handcuffed, according to his
report.</TE>
<TE>   Then, after the boy was handcuffed, Morse, who is white, was seen
on videotape lifting the boy, who is black, off the ground and
slamming him onto the patrol car. Morse then punched Jackson in the
face. Darvish, in his report, said Morse hit Jackson after he grabbed
Morse's testicles.</TE>
<TE>   On Thursday, Cochran disputed the official account of the
incident, saying it was "creative report writing" and said that the
evidence will show that Jackson did not grab Morse's testicles but
rather that an officer grabbed the boy's testicles.</TE>
<TE>   "If not for the video, these police officers would have, as usual,
gotten away with this," Cochran said.</TE>
<TE>   Relatives of Jackson have said he is developmentally disabled and
does not fully process commands. That could play a key role in the
case, according to legal experts.</TE>
<TE>   UCLA criminal law professor Peter Arenella said juries usually
give officers the benefit of the doubt when they use force if there
is any type of resistance by a suspect. In this case, however, the
chances of Morse's conviction on the assault charge will depend
heavily on whether he was aware that the boy was disabled.</TE>
<TE>   "The boy's mental status will become a very important issue in
this case," Arenella said. "The racial composition of the jury could
also have a significant impact on whether the officers are given any
benefit of the doubt."</TE>
<TE>   On the charge against Darvish, one of the primary issues will be
whether jurors believe the officer intended to deceive anyone by
omitting that the boy was slammed onto the trunk of the patrol car.
In his report, Darvish wrote that the officers "assisted Jackson to
his feet and had him stand facing the police vehicle."</TE>
<TE>   Morse was placed on paid administrative leave after the incident.
Darvish has remained on active duty. Four investigations were
launched into the officers' conduct after the tape was repeatedly
aired on national television.</TE>
<TE>   Dist. Atty. Steve Cooley said Thursday that his office moved with
"unprecedented speed" when it began its inquiry into the incident
July 8 and convened a grand jury two days later. The grand jurors
heard 13 witnesses, including several law enforcement officials and
Jackson and his father.</TE>
<TE>   The grand jurors returned their sealed indictment about 3:30 p.m.
Wednesday to Oki. "We used the grand jury as a tool to ensure a
thorough and expeditious investigation," Cooley said after the
hearing.</TE>
<TE>   Cooley added that the investigation is continuing, but declined to
say whether other officers or deputies would be charged. On Thursday,
his prosecutors gave defense attorneys the investigative reports and
copies of the gas station surveillance tape and the videotape by
unemployed deejay Mitchell Crooks.</TE>
<TE>   Morse's attorney, Barnett, said the gas station surveillance tape
shows the beginning of the incident and "the circumstances that
caused the use of force to occur." Barnett said Jackson resisted
arrest, hitting Morse in the throat and ear, scratching his neck and
later grabbing his testicles. That grab justified a punch in the
face, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a proper, reasonable use of force, given the
circumstances," Barnett said, adding that he is convinced the
evidence will show his client is innocent.</TE>
<TE>   Barnett said that the indictment is difficult for Morse, but that
the officer has "faith in the system and faith in God that the truth
will come out and that he will be vindicated."</TE>
<TE>   Darvish's attorney, Ronald G. Brower, said his client gave a
statement to police that he was looking down at his injured knee when
Morse put Jackson on the trunk but that he heard a thump.</TE>
<TE>   "Officer Darvish never tried to hide from anybody the fact that
that actually took place," Brower said.</TE>
<TE>   By not pursuing an indictment against Darvish for assault, Brower
said, authorities determined that it was lawful for his client to
punch Jackson before he was handcuffed.</TE>
<TE>   The defense attorneys pointed out that neither officer was
indicted for any racially motivated crime.</TE>
<TE>   The indictments were a major topic of conversation around
Inglewood on Thursday afternoon.</TE>
<TE>   "To me it looked like [Morse] lost it," said Johnny Jackson, 51,
speaking at a record shop, VIP Music on Market Street.</TE>
<TE>   He said the other officers at the scene deserved suspensions at
the least.</TE>
<TE>   Faye Kelly, 52, said that Morse and Darvish deserved prison time,
but wasn't confident that either officer would ultimately serve any.
"It's an excellent idea to charge them, but they'll get off," she
said. "They'll find some loophole to get them off."</TE>

<HD>3 Sites Searched in Girl's Slaying</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Detectives hunting for the killer of 5-year-old Samantha Runnion late
Thursday served search warrants at an apartment complex in Lake
Elsinore not far from where the girl's body was discovered.</LD>
<LD>   No arrests have been made, but a police source said investigators
are focusing on a 27-year-old man who lives in the apartment complex
after receiving a tip from the public. Detectives interviewed the
suspect Thursday and drew up search warrants for his home off Ortega
Highway, that of a family member in the same complex and a business
in Temecula.</LD>
<LD>   Three green cars roughly matching the description of the killer's
vehicle were confiscated and the suspect has been detained until the
searches are completed.</LD>
<TE>   The developments came after a day in which officers stopped dozens
of men in green cars, interviewed scores of convicted sex offenders
and fielded more than 1,000 calls from across the United States as
they worked to arrest Samantha's killer, who they believe could
strike again.</TE>
<TE>   In a day marked by high anxiety and false alarms and erroneous
reports of arrests, the FBI and Orange County Sheriff's Department
deployed 400 officers across California but said they don't yet know
who is responsible for the girl's kidnapping and murder.</TE>
<TE>   Detectives focused most seriously on a group of potential
suspects--many registered sex offenders--who are being questioned.</TE>
<TE>   Speed is crucial, detectives said, because an FBI profile of the
killer concludes he might kill again soon. Based on the profile,
Sheriff Michael Carona said he believes the man is still somewhere in
Southern California and may live, work or have family in Orange
County.</TE>
<TE>   The dragnet is so massive that authorities are using a tracking
system that helped the FBI investigate domestic terrorism after the
Sept. 11 attacks. A phone bank takes calls, using a special FBI
computer program to set priorities in handling the tips and create a
central database.</TE>
<TE>   As false reports circulated throughout the day that the killer had
been arrested or had attacked again, detectives fought to keep the
investigation on track.</TE>
<TE>   Around noon, police converged on a Costa Mesa neighborhood where a
9-year-old boy claimed a man tried to abduct him outside his house.
The boy later admitted making up the story. An hour earlier,
California Highway Patrol officers in Fresno arrested a man driving a
car similar to the killer's. Investigators questioned the man for
eight hours but said he's not a suspect at this time.</TE>
<TE>   The false reports frustrated investigators. "When the media puts
out that an arrest has been made, we see a marked decrease in the
number of tips that come in, which have been very, very important to
us," Carona said.</TE>
<TE>   Officials would not say how many tips have produced solid leads
but urged the public to keep calling.</TE>
<TE>   "I have worked a number of these cases, and I haven't seen the
kind of public response nationally that I have seen in this one,"
said FBI Special Agent Randy Aden, supervisor of the Crimes Against
Children Task Force at the bureau's Los Angeles office. "This
individual does not just have to worry about law enforcement trying
to find him. The public is out there, and they are watching."</TE>
<TE>   Samantha was snatched from outside her condominium in Stanton on
Monday evening. Detectives believe the kidnapper held her for several
hours, sexually assaulting and eventually asphyxiating her sometime
Tuesday. Officials suggested the girl fought back, scratching her
attacker's face and arms.</TE>
<TE>   Her body was found in the open off a mountain road in the
Cleveland National Forest. The killer posed the body in such a way
that the FBI believes it amounted to a "calling card" and a warning
that he would strike again.</TE>
<TE>   Officials said they've gathered physical evidence, including DNA
samples and tire tracks. The assailant is described as a Latino man
with slicked-back black hair and a mustache who was driving a green
car, possibly a Honda or Acura.</TE>
<TE>   The FBI on Tuesday described the killer as an "Americanized
Latino." FBI spokesman Matt McLaughlin said the bureau based the
description on the fact that the man spoke English with a Spanish
accent, according to a child playing with Samantha when she was
abducted. Detectives theorize that the man came from a
Spanish-speaking country or was born in the United States but spoke
Spanish at home.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities in Riverside County have noticed similarities to a
high-profile kidnapping case of their own five years ago. In that
case, 10-year-old Anthony Martinez was outside his Beaumont home with
friends when his abductor asked for help in finding a lost cat. The
man, described as white with blue eyes, brown hair, a mustache and a
baseball cap, pulled out a knife and snatched Anthony.</TE>
<TE>   Officials, however, have not established a connection in that case
or other child abductions. Authorities are looking into an incident
in Riverside County on Wednesday in which a man fled from a car after
being pursued by police.</TE>
<TE>   Samantha's case is the latest in a series of disappearances of
young girls in recent months nationwide, including abductions in Salt
Lake City and San Diego County. But her disappearance is different,
FBI officials said, because of the flood of tips provided by the
public.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities have made an unusually aggressive appeal for tips,
urging people to call law enforcement officials if they know anyone
who missed work Monday or Tuesday, suffered cuts and bruises or has
shown deep curiosity in coverage of the case.</TE>
<TE>   The calls are routed to a mobile command post set up in a parking
lot across the street from Samantha's condominium complex.</TE>
<TE>   This nerve center consists of two double-wide trailers. Inside
one, administrators and supervisors share information and strategize.
The other buzzes with the sound of fax machines and police scanners
as officers staff 20 phone lines and monitor the Internet.</TE>
<TE>   Those answering calls to the tip line are civilian staff trained
to ask the right questions. They fill out forms the FBI developed
after the terrorist attacks and pass them on to a processor--either
an FBI agent or sheriff's detective--who prioritizes the leads.</TE>
<TE>   These leads are dropped into a box on a pickup table, where 15
teams of two investigators take turns pursuing them.</TE>
<TE>   The teams follow a lead wherever it takes them. They enter
whatever information they find--license plate numbers, descriptions
of people, names, dates of birth--into a database. Some officers have
worked 24 hours straight.</TE>
<TE>   At the Smoketree condominium complex where Samantha lived, her
mother remained in seclusion Thursday. Neighbors and strangers came
to add flowers, stuffed animals and balloons to the memorial that was
growing in the courtyard where Samantha had been such a familiar
face.</TE>

<HD>In High-Crime Neighborhoods, the Line Cops Must Walk Is
Fine Indeed</HD>

<LD>Late one evening about a year ago, while I cruised with two deputies
from the L.A. County Sheriff's Department, we came upon a guy riding
a bicycle in the Compton area.</LD>
<LD>   The deputies, for reasons that were not apparent to me, decided to
find out what he was up to, and we swooped in on him from behind.</LD>
<LD>   As our car came to a head-</LD>
<TE>   jerking stop, the deputy in the passenger seat drew his gun and
aimed it at the cyclist through the windshield.</TE>
<TE>   The next few moments, I knew, would be critical, and went to the
very heart of what it means to be a cop in a tough neighborhood. Or
to be a civilian.</TE>
<TE>   There's a tense moment in every contact on the street, but the
drawn gun raised the stakes. My heart raced, and I remember the
ripple in the tight forearm of the deputy who trained his weapon on
this man none of us knew.</TE>
<TE>   If the cyclist wheeled around with a weapon, I suppose the
officers would have been justified in shooting him. But what if he
was unarmed, and made an abrupt move out of anger or fear? He could
be dead in an instant.</TE>
<TE>   The cyclist turned out to be harmless. He was on his way to score
some dope, he admitted. He had on a ball cap, and one of the deputies
talked to him about baseball for a while, and then they let him go.</TE>
<TE>   This surreal, potentially explosive relationship between police
and civilians is played out every night in virtually every urban
area. It is the story behind the story of the videotaped July 6
Inglewood police altercation with 16-year-old Donovan Jackson, which
led to the indictment of two officers.</TE>
<TE>   "That relationship is what causes Donovan Jackson cases," says
Jackson family spokeswoman Thandi Chimurenga. A police state exists
in some neighborhoods, and getting pulled over is often seen as an
act of harassment or hostility.</TE>
<TE>   "We believe it's simply to keep us terrorized," Chimurenga said.
"There's no reason for six officers to pull over a car" for a
suspected lapse in registration, as was the case with Donovan
Jackson's father.</TE>
<TE>   She's right about the overreaction, but it's not as simple as
that.</TE>
<TE>   That night with the sheriff's deputies, I asked why they stopped
the cyclist at all, let alone pointed a gun at him. They said lots of
gang members ride bikes so they can slip down alleys to avoid cops,
and also to look less like gang members. It was the second time that
night they had stopped someone on a bike.</TE>
<TE>   When the deputies ran checks on license plates, they told me it
was because a car of the same color was reported stolen. If they
pulled over a motorist or stopped pedestrians to ask their name,
where they were coming from and where they were going, it was because
of recent drug activity in the area. Or it was because of an FBI
report that a suspected bank robber might be in the neighborhood.</TE>
<TE>   I didn't buy into all these explanations. Cops are geniuses at
establishing probable cause, and it's easy to see why some folks
resent being treated like suspects every time they leave the house.</TE>
<TE>   But here's the rub:</TE>
<TE>   The crime rate is astronomically high in the neighborhoods we
patrolled that night. Drug activity is out of control. Gang shootings
are routine, and innocent people are sometimes caught in the
cross-fire.</TE>
<TE>   I obviously can't know how the deputies I rode with might behave
when a reporter isn't around, and the fact that they pulled a gun on
a cyclist in my presence is scary enough. But they talked about
serving law-abiding residents who were fed up with crime in the
neighborhood, and they believed they had the backing of those people.</TE>
<TE>   Later, I checked in with several people in the community. Nobody
wanted any unnecessary rough stuff, but almost to a person they said
they wanted to see more of the police, not less. One woman told me
about watching young thugs urinate on her flowers, and then being
threatened when she complained.</TE>
<TE>   I don't offer any of this to excuse the thuggery we saw on the
Inglewood videotape. Whatever led to the altercation, a cop who takes
a handcuffed suspect, slams him into a car and then punches him in
the face ought to be indicted.</TE>
<TE>   No sympathy for that cop's partner, either, who was charged with
filing a false police report, apparently for failing to mention his
colleague's body slam.</TE>
<TE>   But anyone who wants to scream about racism ought to first ask why
the black leadership of Inglewood allowed a black police chief to put
officers on the streets of a predominantly black city with less
training than cops get elsewhere.</TE>
<TE>   The job is explosive and confrontational enough without sending
amateurs out there.</TE>
<TE>   And if Rep. Maxine Waters wants to be a blowhard, that's her
business. But standing in front of cameras and waving a $10,000 check
for the legal problems of the guy who videotaped this beating does
not get to the heart of the matter.</TE>
<TE>   Vast reaches of Greater L.A. lie in utter isolation and despair.
Crime rates battle school dropout rates for national distinction. In
Inglewood, a headless and armless body turned up in an alley July 11
and barely made the news.</TE>
<TE>   No one should have a gun pointed at his head for riding a bicycle,
and no cop should cold-cock a handcuffed suspect. But we'd do well to
remind ourselves that, in the big picture, cops are neither the whole
problem nor the whole solution.</TE>

<HD>Replacing University's Montezuma Mascot Proves Tough</HD>
<DH>Athletics: Campus president cites a lack of agreement in
attempts to replace controversial icon.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TONY PERRY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SAN DIEGO</DL>
<LD>A university that prides itself on tackling society's most vexing
intellectual issues in an atmosphere of civility has run up against a
problem too hot to handle: finding a new mascot.</LD>
<LD>   Stephen Weber, president of San Diego State, announced Thursday
that he has suspended indefinitely the work of his New Mascot
Committee, which was formed in April to find a replacement for
longtime mascot Monty Montezuma.</LD>
<LD>   The committee's recommendation for an Aztec eagle warrior--dressed
in faux eagle's head and feathers--proved just as controversial as
Monty, who was banished after protests from Native American
activists.</LD>
<TE>   They said the school's depiction of the Aztec emperor was
culturally demeaning and even racist.</TE>
<TE>   "A mascot is intended to be an appropriate unifying,
spirit-raising symbol of the university," Weber said. "To date, we
have been unable to develop a mascot that meets these criteria."</TE>
<TE>   Weber's decision means the Aztecs will be without a mascot when
the football season opens Sept. 14 with a home game against the
Arizona State University Sun Devils at Qualcomm Stadium.</TE>
<TE>   To placate Monty loyalists, Weber had promised to have a mascot in
place by then.</TE>
<TE>   Although hailed by some students and alumni, Weber's decision to
veto the mascot committee's eagle warrior was immediately denounced
by Monty fans. It was even criticized by some students who had agreed
that Monty was over the top culturally.</TE>
<TE>   "This is pathetic," said county Supervisor Dianne Jacob, one of
the university's distinguished alumnae of the year.</TE>
<TE>   "The proud tradition of Monty Montezuma has now been eliminated
because of the desire of top administrators to be politically
correct. Where's the backbone?"</TE>
<TE>   But former student Reynaldo Ortiz said he was pleased with Weber's
announcement.</TE>
<TE>   "What part of this don't they understand?" Ortiz said.</TE>
<TE>   "You just don't mess around with somebody else's culture for your
amusement. People are not mascots."</TE>
<TE>   The mascot issue has flared at numerous campuses in recent years.</TE>
<TE>   In late May the state Assembly rejected a bill by Assemblywoman
Jackie Goldberg (D-Los Angeles) that would have made California the
first state to ban Native American team mascots at public schools.</TE>
<TE>   After two years of rancorous debate, Weber decided last year to
elevate Monty Montezuma into Ambassador Montezuma and have him
represent the university and discuss the glories of Aztec culture at
schools and other educational settings.</TE>
<TE>   This spring, Weber appointed a committee of professors, students,
alums and administrators to bring a suggestion to him for a mascot
that would be culturally sensitive but retain the university's
tradition of referring to its athletic teams as Aztecs.</TE>
<TE>   Renewed Dispute</TE>
<TE>   The committee, however, fell into the same schism that had divided
the university and surrounding community over Monty.</TE>
<TE>   The recommendation for the eagle warrior was carried on a narrow
vote.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think anybody ever thought we could be unanimous," said
mascot committee Co-Chairman Dennis Cushman, the university's
associate vice president of marketing and communications.</TE>
<TE>   With the help of Berkeley designer Kurt Osaki, the committee
narrowed several dozen suggestions down to three:</TE>
<TE>   * The eagle warrior.</TE>
<TE>   * A puma warrior dressed in ersatz mountain lion costume.</TE>
<TE>   * A more whimsical, stylized Aztec figure.</TE>
<TE>   "The eagle warrior just sounds like Monty Lite," Ortiz said.</TE>
<TE>   Rather than fight the Monty battle redux, Weber decided to retreat
and deal with other campus issues.</TE>
<TE>   "For now, we will focus our attention on other priorities," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   Devotion to Monty runs deep in this community, where San Diego
State graduates play major roles in business, politics and
government.</TE>
<TE>   San Diego State has used the name Aztecs since the 1920s, and the
first Monty Montezuma appeared as the university mascot in the 1940s.</TE>
<TE>   Although the Monty character went through several incarnations, he
was finally portrayed by a handsome, muscular undergraduate, running
onto the football field in full headdress with a flaming spear,
urging fans to root for the Aztecs.</TE>
<TE>   Native American activists accused the figure of being a
historically inaccurate portrayal of the 16th century ruler who was
worshipped as a god by his subjects and was of a contemplative
demeanor.</TE>
<TE>   Mascot's Make-Over</TE>
<TE>   Despite overwhelming support for Monty from students, alumni and
the Board of Supervisors--all five of them San Diego State
graduates--Weber decided Monty was an inappropriate mascot.</TE>
<TE>   But instead of terminating Monty, Weber decided to elevate him
into an ambassador, complete with a new historically accurate costume
and demeanor, vetted by various academics.</TE>
<TE>   The student body government--in defiance of most of their
constituents--had sided with Native American activists who called
Monty an offensive anachronism.</TE>
<TE>   Still, student body leaders had not considered that making Monty
into an ambassador would leave the university without a mascot.</TE>
<TE>   "This is going to be awful for school spirit," said Mary
Tolentino, a marketing major and vice president of the student
government.</TE>
<TE>   "Look at schools that really have spirit like Long Beach [49ers]
and Dominguez Hills [Toros], they have yells and mascots. San Diego
will have nothing. Aztec spirit is the whole reason a lot of people
come here."</TE>
<TE>   Although Weber's decision has put the issue on hold, another
marketing challenge looms with the scheduled announcement next week
of a new logo to grace the university's mugs, T-shirts and other
trinkets.</TE>
<TE>   With Monty out, the school wants another symbol to help sell San
Diego State gear--an important source of funds for the athletic
department.</TE>
<TE>   Cushman said: "These things are very emotionally charged."</TE>

<HD>Court Accepts Medical Pot Use</HD>
<DH>Law: A patient who grows or smokes marijuana for personal
health reasons, with a doctor's OK, cannot be prosecuted in state
court, California justices rule.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MAURA DOLAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SAN FRANCISCO</DL>
<LD>Californians who use or grow marijuana for personal medical use are
protected from prosecution in state court as long as they have
doctors' approval, the California Supreme Court decided unanimously
Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   In its first review of the medical marijuana initiative, which was
approved by voters in 1996, the court said a medical user who is
arrested can get the charges dismissed without a trial if the patient
has a note on a prescription pad or any other evidence of a doctor's
approval.</LD>
<LD>   The ruling overturns the felony conviction of a blind man with
diabetes who was arrested after police spotted 31 marijuana plants
growing in the frontyard of his home in Twain Harte in Tuolumne
County.</LD>
<TE>   Under the state law, "the possession and cultivation of marijuana
is no more criminal--so long as its conditions are satisfied--than
the possession and acquisition of any prescription drug with a
physician's prescription," Chief Justice Ronald M. George wrote for
the court.</TE>
<TE>   The decision widens the gap between the treatment of marijuana
cases in California's state courts and in federal courts in the
state.</TE>
<TE>   Until Thursday, all major rulings on Proposition 215, the state's
medical marijuana law, have been made by federal courts and based on
federal law.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. Supreme Court, in a case on the California initiative,
ruled that there is no medical exception for the use of marijuana
under federal law. As a result, people can still be prosecuted in
federal court, regardless of the state law.</TE>
<TE>   But individual users and growers in California are generally
prosecuted in state courts, which are required to follow Thursday's
ruling.</TE>
<TE>   Gerald Uelmen, a University of Santa Clara law professor who
argued the case for defendant Myron Carlyle Mower, 40, said the
decision would reduce prosecutions throughout the state.</TE>
<TE>   Since 56% of voters approved Proposition 215, dozens of
Californians have been arrested on marijuana charges despite claims
of medical need, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "It is a wonderful victory for patients," Uelmen said.</TE>
<TE>   He said he hoped the ruling would discourage police from arresting
those who grow marijuana and have doctors' notes recommending its
use.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think police are interested in arresting people who are
not going to be prosecuted," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Ann Brick, a lawyer with the American Civil Liberties Union, which
also argued for Mower, praised the court for being "quite protective
of the rights of medical marijuana patients."</TE>
<TE>   "The court is making very clear that it understands the people of
California wanted to confer real protection to the medical users of
marijuana, and this decision helps make that possible," Brick said.</TE>
<TE>   The state attorney general's office, which represented Tuolumne
County prosecutors in the appeal, said it was reviewing the decision.</TE>
<TE>   California is one of nine states with medical marijuana laws. The
decision was the first by a state high court on such a law, Uelmen
said.</TE>
<TE>   After Mower's conviction, a state appeals court said the voter
initiative had merely given defendants the right to present a medical
defense during a trial.</TE>
<TE>   That ruling, by a Court of Appeal in Fresno, also said that users
or growers must show, by a preponderance of the evidence, that they
had the marijuana solely for medical purposes.</TE>
<TE>   Under Thursday's ruling, by contrast, a grower or user can ask a
judge to dismiss the charges without trial.</TE>
<TE>   If the amount of marijuana involved is considered large or the
doctor's approval questionable, the defendant might still face a
trial to determine whether the marijuana was purely for the
defendant's medical use.</TE>
<TE>   But the ruling also made it easier for such defendants to win if a
case goes to court. Under the court's ruling, the defendant does not
have to prove that the marijuana is solely for medical use. If there
is any reasonable doubt about the marijuana's use, the defendant
wins. "Most similar is the defense of possession of a dangerous or
restricted drug with a physician's prescription, against a charge of
unlawful possession of such a drug," George wrote.</TE>
<TE>   "For that defense, a defendant need raise only a reasonable doubt
as to his or her possession of the drug in question with a
physician's prescription."</TE>
<TE>   The court cited a provision in the initiative that says criminal
penalties "shall not apply to a patient, or to a patient's primary
caregiver, who possesses or cultivates marijuana for the personal
medical purposes of the patient upon the written or oral
recommendation or approval of a physician."</TE>
<TE>   "The provision," the court said in People v. Mower, S094490,
"renders possession and cultivation of marijuana noncriminal" when it
is done for medical purposes.</TE>
<TE>   Mower, who has had diabetes since he was 8 years old, testified
that the 31 plants would supply him with 5 pounds of marijuana in a
year and estimated his consumption at eight grams a day.</TE>
<TE>   An expert witness for the defense testified that the plants would
yield 4.35 pounds a year, but an expert for the prosecution countered
that the plants would produce 31 to 62 pounds.</TE>
<TE>   "Had the jury properly been instructed that defendant was required
merely to raise a reasonable doubt about his purposes ... it might
have found him not guilty," George wrote for the court. "We come to
this conclusion because the jury might have found that defendant
raised a reasonable doubt--to wit, whether the 31 plants would yield
a harvest of only about 5 pounds for a year's supply."</TE>
<TE>   Mower, who said he cannot maintain his weight without using
marijuana, had been sentenced to five years' probation for growing
the plants.</TE>
<TE>   "I have a doctor who completely agrees with me that I need to have
this," Mower said. "I have nausea all the time and wasting syndrome.
And if I smoke a little, I am in the kitchen looking for something to
eat and drink."</TE>
<TE>   He said marijuana also puts him in a good mood and gives him
stamina.</TE>
<TE>   The issue in Mower's case was the number of plants he was growing.
A Tuolumne County police policy says medical users may have three
plants.</TE>
<TE>   "They pulled out all but three of the worst plants and two weeks
later took us to jail, booked me and kept my wife overnight," Mower
said.</TE>
<TE>   He said he now hopes to return to court and ask a judge to permit
him to grow more than three plants, which are "not anywhere near
enough." He said he needs to smoke about six or seven marijuana
cigarettes a day and has been forced to buy from an illicit dealer.</TE>
<TE>   "Those drug houses are dangerous places to be," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Counties around the state have different policies about how many
plants a medical user may grow. The permitted amounts range from
three plants to 99. The ruling did not address the variance in
policies.</TE>
<TE>   "That's a bit of a disappointment," said Uelmen, Mower's lawyer,
"because it is an issue of a grave statewide concern and a cause of a
lot of confusion....We need a statewide standard, but that will have
to wait for another day."</TE>
<TE>   For users who are not advised to smoke marijuana for medical
reasons, possession of less than an ounce in California is a
misdemeanor punishable by a $100 fine. Cultivation is a felony.</TE>
<TE>   Lael Rubin, special counsel to the Los Angeles County district
attorney, said the district attorney's office does not prosecute
growers unless they have at least 25 plants and there is evidence of
a commercial purpose, such as scales and plastic bags. Other cases
are treated as misdemeanors and referred to the city attorney, she
said.</TE>

<HD>SIDS Group's Data Are Challenged</HD>
<DH>Health: County says a foundation overstated the local death
toll and breached confidentiality.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Los Angeles County health officials say the local foundation that
raises money to counsel families affected by Sudden Infant Death
Syndrome has overstated the local death toll and has breached the
confidentiality of families whose children have died.</LD>
<LD>   As a result, in a letter sent to the SIDS Foundation of Southern
California this week, officials said they would no longer provide the
group with the names of children who have been identified as possible
SIDS victims.</LD>
<LD>   The county's actions were prompted in part by a parent activist
who says the Ventura County coroner's office erroneously attributed
her son's 1995 death to SIDS.</LD>
<TE>   Heather Aitken, who runs a separate group to help grieving
parents, contends that the SIDS foundation is publishing inflated
figures in hopes of attracting donors and maintaining research
funding despite the decline in SIDS.</TE>
<TE>   Aitken said she has received harassing phone calls from people
identifying themselves as being affiliated with SIDS organizations,
telling her to stop challenging the SIDS cause. Money raised by SIDS
groups, she said, is used for "their own hype, their own publicity."</TE>
<TE>   She says the money should be directed to all families whose
children die, regardless of the cause.</TE>
<TE>   SIDS Foundation Executive Director Margot Bennett said her group,
whose board consists mostly of relatives of babies who died, has
nothing but honorable intentions. She said she is confident that none
of her members harassed Aitken.</TE>
<TE>   Although some of its statements may have been incorrect, she said,
any mistakes were inadvertent.</TE>
<TE>   In its January newsletter, the foundation said that the SIDS rate
had increased in Southern California despite a national decline. It
listed the names of 75 children who died in 2001.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, only 22 infant deaths last year were officially
classified as SIDS, the lowest number ever, Los Angeles County health
officials said.</TE>
<TE>   All 75 infants' deaths reported in the newsletter were initially
investigated as possible SIDS cases, but the coroner found other
causes or classified the deaths as being unexplained.</TE>
<TE>   At least two are believed to have been homicide victims, health
officials said.</TE>
<TE>   Infants younger than 1 can be diagnosed with SIDS only if they die
unexpectedly and if medical examiners cannot find any other possible
explanation.</TE>
<TE>   Listing the children's names, Bennett said, was a way to honor
them.</TE>
<TE>   She said the SIDS foundation has printed such names for several
years, and county officials have never raised an objection. The
county says the names were given to the group in confidence and
should not have been reprinted.</TE>
<TE>   "We really are just there to help," Bennett said of the
organization, which has an annual budget of $70,000.</TE>
<TE>   "We want to correct whatever we've done by accident, with no
malice absolutely. We thought we were providing a service. We get
many thanks for those names being published from parents as well."</TE>
<TE>   Tara Mendoza, 27, said one of her relatives sent a donation to the
foundation after seeing her son's name on the 2001 list. But Mendoza
said the Los Angeles County coroner suspects that her son, Tyler,
died of laryngitis, not SIDS, in December.</TE>
<TE>   The newsletter is "strictly being used as a profitable game," said
Mendoza, a medical office referral coordinator. "They do not want to
see the numbers go down."</TE>
<TE>   The county's decision is a break from its long-standing practice
of informing the SIDS foundation whenever it suspected that a baby
had died of SIDS.</TE>
<TE>   The foundation sent out letters offering its services to the
families and it printed the babies' names in its newsletter.</TE>
<TE>   In the end, though, only a fraction of those babies had confirmed
SIDS diagnoses.</TE>
<TE>   Now, according to the county, public health nurses will tell
families how to contact the foundation if they want help.</TE>
<TE>   The foundation will be able to learn the names of babies who died
of SIDS only after death certificates have been completed by the
coroner's office.</TE>
<TE>   Wendy Schiffer, director of children's health initiatives for the
Los Angeles County Department of Health Services, said she doesn't
believe the SIDS foundation maliciously misrepresented the numbers.</TE>
<TE>   "I really don't know what their motive is," Schiffer said. "I
don't think it was anything bad. They've apologized for doing it."</TE>
<TE>   Other SIDS groups around the country have also provided incorrect
information on deaths attributed to the syndrome.</TE>
<TE>   Until this week, the Web site for the Bucks County, Pa., chapter
pegged the nationwide SIDS toll at 6,000.</TE>
<TE>   The Iowa SIDS Alliance pegged the figure at nearly 4,000.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, the National Center for Health Statistics reported 2,648
deaths in 1999, and preliminary data show that the figure dropped to
2,151 in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   The annual total has dropped by more than half since 1992, when
the American Academy of Pediatrics recommended that healthy infants
be placed on their backs to sleep to reduce the risk of SIDS.</TE>
<TE>   The chapters in Iowa and Bucks County updated their Web sites this
week after The Times raised the errors with the National SIDS
Alliance, the national umbrella group. The alliance sent out a memo
asking its affiliates to provide factual information.</TE>
<TE>   "Most of them are just volunteers out there whose main mission is
to help families who've lost babies to Sudden Infant Death Syndrome,
to give them grief support," said Deborah Boyd, the alliance's
interim executive director. "They're certainly not [misreporting the
numbers] ... to garner more money."</TE>
<TE>   Although SIDS still remains the leading cause of death for infants
between 1 month and 1 year nationally, the precipitous decline in
SIDS has placed added pressure on support groups to survive and stay
relevant.</TE>
<TE>   Over the past few years, parent groups have lost veteran members,
and new parents haven't signed on.</TE>
<TE>   "Many SIDS parent organizations that were once thriving are now
barely holding on," Ben Carranco, the state's SIDS program
consultant, wrote in a June newsletter.</TE>
<TE>   As a result, some SIDS groups have expanded their reach to include
other infants who die of unexplained causes.</TE>
<TE>   The Southern California foundation said it began offering
counseling for other infant deaths in January 2001.</TE>
<TE>   And nationally, the SIDS Alliance is discussing a change in its
name and mission.</TE>
<TE>   Bennett said SIDS advocates are committed to being open and honest
with the public.</TE>
<TE>   "It would be an absolute shame if the only way to get funding out
of the government was to inflate the numbers," she said.</TE>
<TE>   "It should just be enough that infants are dying and people don't
know why."</TE>

<HD>Termite Inspection Control Goes Full Bore</HD>
<DH>A state board follows up on legal complaints from
homeowners who suspect pest damage even after getting a company's
favorable report.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JIM HOLLANDER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Dennis Patzer thought he had seen it all.</LD>
<LD>   As chief legal enforcement officer for the state's Structural Pest
Control Board, he had reviewed thousands of legal complaints by irate
homeowners challenging the findings in a termite inspection report.</LD>
<LD>   But Patzer still chuckles when he recalls a 1997 case in which the
owner of a San Diego-area pest control company was found to have
missed 17 individual problems that were in immediate need of repair.</LD>
<TE>   "I've never seen anything like it," Patzer says of the complaint
against the company. "It went all the way to the state attorney
general for licensing action."</TE>
<TE>   Termite reports are nearly always required by lenders in
residential real estate sales, and with the market sizzling
statewide, the Sacramento-based pest control board is busier than
ever.</TE>
<TE>   Kelli Okuma, the board's registrar, says her agency normally gets
about 1,200 complaints a year. "But historically, as the market
increases--or when [interest] rates drop and a lot of people
refinance--we get more," she says.</TE>
<TE>   More than 80% of the complaints the board receives are driven by
escrow transactions, Okuma said. Complaints generally involve a new
owner's allegation that a pest control firm failed to detect visible
conditions that require repair, such as a wood-destroying fungus on a
deck, front steps weakened by termite infestation or window frames
damaged by moisture.</TE>
<TE>   In regulating the pest control industry, the state board is
legally responsible for disciplining errant companies and
individuals. It has eight investigators, five of whom are based in
Southern California.</TE>
<TE>   Patzer said that there are 2,153 registered termite inspection
companies in the state and that they performed about 1.3 million
inspections last year.</TE>
<TE>   In the same period, the board reviewed 1,340 complaints, 38 of
which resulted in license suspension or revocation by the state
attorney general's office and 50 more in citations or fines. An
additional 320 cases were referred to county agencies for
disciplinary action.</TE>
<TE>   Most complaints arise shortly after escrow closes and the new
owner sees the house for the first time without the furniture,
carpets and crammed closets. Although sellers are required by law to
disclose everything they know about a property's condition, it's what
they don't know that the buyer expects the inspection company to find
for them.</TE>
<TE>   Although inspections are not required by the state, a prospective
buyer "should always have one," says Gary Effron, a Los Angeles
attorney specializing in real estate cases. "You have to know what
you're buying. It's a practical matter."</TE>
<TE>   The state regulates the industry by statute through the Business
and Professions Code. Lenders require immediate correction for most
major problems, known as Section 1 findings, before a property sale
can be concluded. Unless the arrangement has been otherwise
negotiated, the seller is usually financially responsible. Potential
problems that warrant continued watching, but do not necessitate
immediate repair, fall into a second category known as Section 2
problems.</TE>
<TE>   Harvey Logan, executive vice president of the Pest Control
Operators of California, the largest industry trade group in the
state, says it was the pest control companies that lobbied the
Legislature in 1935 to form a regulatory board.</TE>
<TE>   "We've always been very proactive," he says.</TE>
<TE>   His group is particularly busy these days. "Termites swarm in
spring and summer. So, whether people are selling their homes or not,
this is our time of year."</TE>
<TE>   Many termite companies do the repairs themselves, but others
subcontract, particularly for tenting, the most common method of
residential fumigation. Although it is not uncommon for a seller to
choose a different repair company to undertake the work, the company
that made the initial report must provide the certification that the
job has been completed.</TE>
<TE>   If a seller has a second inspection, disclosure laws require that
the information from both reports be made available to the buyer. And
there must be a clearance for all Section 1 items in both reports.</TE>
<TE>   When buyers discover problems they believe should have been
uncovered on the termite inspection report, they can file written
complaints with the control board. But the state won't act unless a
second inspection is undertaken.</TE>
<TE>   Okuma says the board first tries to mediate disputes between
homeowners and inspectors. "Only if a violation was committed, and is
serious enough, will we send in an investigator," she says. "If it is
determined that the company should have found the problem, we issue a
report of findings and give them 30 days to correct the problem, at
no charge to the homeowner."</TE>
<TE>   She noted that buyers who are aware that a problem existed before
the close of escrow but do not act cannot later demand that it be
fixed at no cost, even if the company was found in violation and was
subjected to licensing action and civil penalties.</TE>
<TE>   Nearly all complaints against pest control companies, Okuma says,
are resolved through mediation. The process usually takes two to
three months.</TE>
<TE>   "Depending on the time frame, we really like to get the companies
to work with the consumer," she says. "It's better when they can work
it out."</TE>
<TE>   That is not what happened with the case cited by Patzer, the
board's chief enforcement officer. He said the inspector who missed
17 problem conditions was forced to make restitution of $15,000, in
addition to repayment for all costs related to pursuing the case.</TE>
<TE>   The inspector had his license suspended as well, and was ordered
to pay a civil penalty of $1,000 and take continuing education
classes.</TE>
<TE>   "Guess what?" said Patzer. "He's back up before us again--for the
exact same thing."</TE>

<HD>O.C. Studies Proposals to Treat Sewage</HD>
<DH>Environment: Two new plants may take 11 years to build.
District seeks a shield from fines in interim.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SEEMA MEHTA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In the wake of the decision to begin more intensive treatment of
local waste water, engineers at the Orange County Sanitation District
began working in earnest Thursday on plans for two facilities
estimated to cost $270 million and take as long as 11 years to build.</LD>
<LD>   Attorneys for the Fountain Valley-based agency were also preparing
for negotiations with state and federal authorities to shield it from
penalties as it gives up its federal waiver allowing it to pump
moderately treated sewage about four miles off Huntington Beach.</LD>
<LD>   The district considered seeking a renewal of its waiver to the
U.S. Clean Water Act until Wednesday night, when a concerted campaign
by environmental activists--concerned about repeated closures of
polluted beaches--persuaded 13 of the district's 25 board members to
vote to treat Orange County sewage to the same levels as nearly all
of the nation's 16,000 sanitation agencies.</LD>
<TE>   More immediately, state water officials are scheduled to decide
today whether to allow the district to chlorinate the 243 million
gallons it discharges daily. Chlorination had been proposed earlier
this year after a plume of the discharged sewage migrated back to
within half a mile of Newport Beach.</TE>
<TE>   "We've got work to do,'' said Blake Anderson, general manager of
the sanitation agency, which serves more than 2.7 million residents
and businesses in northern and central Orange County.</TE>
<TE>   On Thursday, environmentalists were euphoric. They had prevailed
over some business leaders and local officials who contended that the
cost of additional treatment was too great and its impact on coastal
water quality unknown.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a start," said Jan Vandersloot, founder of the Ocean
Outfall Group, which conducted a city-by-city campaign to kill the
waiver. "It's not ended; it's a very good beginning."</TE>
<TE>   The higher standards will require building sewage treatment plants
in Fountain Valley and Huntington Beach. Currently, only half the
discharged waste water receives treatment to remove most microscopic
solids and bacteria, viruses and other disease-causing pathogens.</TE>
<TE>   Initially, the district estimated greater treatment could cost as
much as $400 million, but revised that figure downward this spring.
Most residents would pay an average of $16 more annually for the new
facilities; businesses could pay significantly more, depending on the
amount of sewage generated.</TE>
<TE>   The district is studying which technology to employ.</TE>
<TE>   The conventional method involves bacteria, contained in sludge,
that eat the solids and reduce the amount of oxygen used. "It's like
billions and billions of little PacMen consuming the dissolved
material in waste water," Anderson said.</TE>
<TE>   He said the district will explore micro-filtration and other
techniques, and decide upon a method within two years. An independent
panel of sanitary engineers will review the district's schedules and
timelines, he said.</TE>
<TE>   One fear that almost derailed the vote to abandon the waiver was
raised late Wednesday by agency attorneys. They said that without a
waiver in place once the current one expires next June, the district
would be violating the federal Clean Water Act until the new
facilities come on line about 2013. That could mean fines starting at
$3,000 a day, lawyers told board members.</TE>
<TE>   On Thursday, state and federal officials expressed optimism that
all parties could reach an agreement that would shield the district
from penalties.</TE>
<TE>   "They're stepping up and doing the right thing," said Kurt
Berchtold, assistant executive officer of the Santa Ana Regional
Water Quality Control Board. "I don't think anyone's going to try and
penalize them for that."</TE>
<TE>   Tom Huetteman, chief of the Environmental Protection Agency's
water compliance program in San Francisco, said that although he
couldn't comment on the specifics of the sanitation district's plans,
"The bottom line is: We would like to encourage [higher] treatment,
so we don't want to be in a position where the actions we're taking
are discouraging [it]."</TE>
<TE>   The regional board will meet today in Fountain Valley to consider
the sanitation district's plan to treat sewage with a solution three
times stronger than household bleach.</TE>
<TE>   The district proposed the chlorination plan after the sewage plume
was detected in February off Newport Beach. However, no one knows
whether the plume has been responsible for the rash of closures and
warnings along Huntington Beach's shoreline since 1999. Millions of
dollars in studies on whether the partially treated sewage was the
cause have been inconclusive, and sometimes contradictory. One showed
no evidence that the plume was coming to shore, while another
concluded that underwater waves could sweep the sewage back onto Surf
City's coastline.</TE>
<TE>   Many people are generally supportive of the chlorination plan, but
some environmentalists worry it will have harmful consequences.</TE>
<TE>   Retired physician Jack Skinner, a longtime Newport Beach
environmentalist, said the chlorination could create "a false sense
of security." He said it could kill the very indicator bacteria the
state uses in tests to judge how safe beaches are, while sparing some
viruses and other disease-causing agents that would remain health
hazards.</TE>
<TE>   Philanthropist Joan Irvine Smith worried that large amounts of
toxic chlorine could inadvertently be released, killing marine life.</TE>
<TE>   Vandersloot said he hopes the chlorine is only a short-term
measure, and that the district eventually will use a nontoxic
disinfectant like ultraviolet light.</TE>
<TE>   He said his group plans to fight the remaining three California
sanitation districts that hold federal waivers, while keeping the
pressure on the Orange County agency:</TE>
<TE>   "We want to go beyond this, but we also want to make sure the
district doesn't do any backsliding," Vandersloot said.</TE>

<HD>Interim Chancellor Aims to Build Trust</HD>
<DH>College district: James Walker, the retired president of
the Moorpark campus, takes over while embattled Philip Westin is on
leave during inquiry.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>AMANDA COVARRUBIAS and MARGARET TALEV</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The newly appointed acting chief of Ventura County's Community
College District promised Thursday to restore public confidence as
the district investigates charges of overspending by Chancellor
Philip Westin.</LD>
<LD>   "My job is to get us back to what we're all about," James Walker
said as he settled into a temporary office at district headquarters
in Camarillo.</LD>
<LD>   The 66-year-old Walker was installed as acting chancellor
Thursday, two days after Westin was placed on administrative leave.</LD>
<TE>   Board President Norman Nagel said Walker will bring stability to
the troubled district, which has been pummeled by allegations that
Westin misspent tens of thousands of taxpayer dollars on meals,
travel, computers, auto repairs and improper contracts.</TE>
<TE>   "We all feel we need to reach out to the public and show the
community college system is still a viable entity," Nagel said.</TE>
<TE>   Walker retired July 1 after 10 years as president of Moorpark
College, but he barely had a chance to relax before he was back in a
suit and button-down shirt.</TE>
<TE>   In a touch more about symbolism than style, he chose a garish
necktie depicting scattered jigsaw shapes. "I'm here," he explained,
"to help sort out the puzzle."</TE>
<TE>   "If I'm a parent out there, I'd hope they would not discourage any
of their youngsters from attending any one of the [district's] three
colleges," Walker said of the recent controversies. "What goes on in
the classroom is really separate from what happens in the political
arena. It's also important I restore the confidence of the people who
work in this district."</TE>
<TE>   Trustees voted unanimously to appoint Walker to lead the district,
which includes Ventura and Oxnard colleges, while they investigate
the expenses submitted by Westin over the last six years.</TE>
<TE>   Some of the allegations about Westin's spending were contained in
a report presented to trustees in March by the Camarillo law firm of
Wood &amp; Bender. Others emerged this week in a Superior Court lawsuit
filed on behalf of county taxpayers by the Ventura firm of Benton,
Orr, Duval &amp; Buckingham.</TE>
<TE>   Westin, who was unavailable for comment Thursday, has acknowledged
poor judgment on some purchases but has denied violating any laws or
district policy and has repeatedly said he would not resign. He has
also questioned the motives of his critics.</TE>
<TE>   Since allegations surfaced in March, trustees have flip-flopped
regarding their support for Westin. They first sought his
resignation, then voted 4 to 1 in May to raise his salary 16% to
$203,000 and extend his contract through 2006. The contract also
guarantees him a $305,000 buyout if he is removed from his job
without cause.</TE>
<TE>   A public outcry erupted after the contract was approved, as
taxpayer advocates and private citizens joined Westin's long-standing
union foes in calling for his ouster.</TE>
<TE>   Several critics said they would not have supported the district's
$356-million construction bond in March had they known about the
chancellor's spending habits.</TE>
<TE>   Under pressure, trustees--three of whom are up for reelection in
November--voted earlier this week to place Westin on paid
administrative leave until further notice.</TE>
<TE>   Walker previously served as interim chancellor for 13 months
between the death of Chancellor Thomas Lakin and Westin's hiring in
1996. As the district's chief negotiator last year with the faculty
union, Walker earned a reputation with leaders of the Ventura County
Federation of College Teachers as an evenhanded and open-minded
administrator.</TE>
<TE>   "He's a very positive person, well thought of by all factions of
the district," said trustee Allan Jacobs, who has been targeted for
recall for his support of Westin. "I think he's the perfect person to
help calm the waters."</TE>
<TE>   Walker declined to predict Westin's fate or discuss the
allegations. "I'm not going to reflect on anything that's happened,"
he said. "I just want to look ahead."</TE>
<TE>   Walker officially begins work Monday and will continue
indefinitely. At a meeting scheduled for Tuesday, trustees are
expected to approve an agreement that would pay him about $15,000 per
month plus benefits.</TE>

<HD>Upstate N.Y. Wins High-Tech Operation</HD>
<DH>Economy: Officials hope $400-million facility for making
computer chips will provide a big boost.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOSH GETLIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>A group of the world's largest computer chip makers announced
Thursday that it will open a huge research and development center at
the State University at Albany--a move that could dramatically boost
New York's beleaguered upstate economy.</LD>
<LD>   The $400-million facility, to be operated by International
Sematech, a consortium of 12 major computer manufacturers, is set to
open in the fall. It is expected to generate thousands of jobs as
well as new high-tech companies in the Upper Hudson Valley, according
to New York Gov. George Pataki, who lobbied heavily over the last 10
months to bring the facility to New York.</LD>
<LD>   "This has the potential to be the best thing for upstate since the
construction of the Erie Canal," said Pataki, who may reap
considerable political advantage from the project as he seeks a third
term in November. "Forty-nine other states and nations from around
the globe would be thrilled to have secured this facility, but it's
coming right here."</LD>
<TE>   Pataki, who made the announcement at a news conference on the
Albany campus, predicted that the facility would help a region hit
hard by lingering unemployment and a wave of factory closings. "Today
there is a buzz out there," he said, adding that a multitude of new
high-tech firms "are going to look at Buffalo, they're going to look
at Rochester, they're going to look at Syracuse, they're going to
look across this state."</TE>
<TE>   The facility, to be called International Sematech North, will be
the second such operation for Sematech--an acronym standing for
Semiconductor Manufacturing Technology--in the United States. The
first was built in Austin, Texas, in 1988, and spurred a boom in the
region. More than 2,000 technology companies are located in the
Austin area, employing more than 125,000 people, many of them with
high-paying jobs.</TE>
<TE>   New York had competed fiercely for the first Sematech contract
along with 35 other states. When the group announced plans for a
second facility, Pataki began negotiations with consortium officials.
He met with Sematech President Robert Helms, stressing New York's
commitment to high-tech research as well as the Hudson Valley's low
cost of living.</TE>
<TE>   "I've seen Silicon Valley," said Pataki, summarizing his lobbying
pitch. "It's hot, it's dry, there's earthquakes. Come to Albany."</TE>
<TE>   Before making its decision, the group considered sites in Europe
and several states. The consortium includes IBM, Intel, Motorola,
Hewlett-Packard, Texas Instruments, Advanced Micro Devices, Agere
Systems (Lucent), Philips of the Netherlands, Infineon Technologies
of Germany, STMicroelectronics of France, Hynix of Korea and TSMC of
Taiwan.</TE>
<TE>   For years, candidates of both major parties have sought to use
upstate New York's economic woes as an issue, and many expected that
either state Comptroller Carl McCall or former HUD Secretary Andrew
Cuomo--the two Democrats vying to take on Pataki in November--would
do the same.</TE>
<TE>   Pataki's backers believe he found a way to defuse the issue with
Thursday's announcement. But McCall wondered whether the news was "an
election year gimmick," and Cuomo said it was "too little, too late."</TE>
<TE>   Although the new Sematech operation will initially create only 260
jobs, thousands more may be generated as the facility begins
manufacturing new, state-of-the-art 300-millimeter wafers--or silicon
discs nearly a foot in diameter.</TE>
<TE>   Sponsors are hoping for a repeat of the Austin experience, where
the rapid growth of a university center paved the way for more
high-tech firms to flow into the region and cluster around the new
facility.</TE>
<TE>   Some have cautioned New York about expecting too much from the
facility, noting that the semiconductor industry has cooled off
considerably after boom years in the late 1980s and 1990s. But
Semiconductor Industry Assn. analysts have said they are hoping for a
small upturn this year.</TE>
<TE>   Under the New York agreement, the consortium will contribute $193
million over five years toward the facility's operating budget; the
state will provide $210 million, with most of the money going toward
purchase of manufacturing equipment.</TE>

<HD>U.S. Will Not Prosecute Fire Starter</HD>
<DH>Law: Criminal intent is lacking in the case of lost woman
who set a bush ablaze, leading to a huge wildfire, official says.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>HEBER-OVERGAARD, Ariz.</DL>
<LD>Federal authorities won't prosecute a woman who set a signal fire
that exploded and merged with another blaze to form the largest
wildfire in state history, Arizona's federal prosecutor said
Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   U.S. Atty. Paul K. Charlton said there was insufficient evidence
of criminal intent on Valinda Elliott's part. He said the facts would
have supported a defense that she acted out of necessity.</LD>
<LD>   "A reasonable person could have expected this fire to remain
contained," Charlton said.</LD>
<TE>   Residents attending Charlton's news conference in a school
gymnasium booed the announcement and shouted, "No!" A man threw a
charred log onto the floor and was taken away by police.</TE>
<TE>   Elliott, 31, a Phoenix resident, said she had been lost for two
nights on the Fort Apache Indian Reservation in eastern Arizona when
she set fire to a small bush June 20 in an attempt to signal a news
helicopter, which rescued her.</TE>
<TE>   The fire she started, named the Chediski fire, eventually merged
with another called the Rodeo fire. The combined inferno destroyed at
least 467 homes, scorched nearly 469,000 acres and forced about
30,000 people to flee their homes before it was contained earlier
this month.</TE>
<TE>   "If there was some other way I could have gotten that helicopter's
attention, I would have used it," Elliott had said previously.</TE>
<TE>   Calls to Elliott's attorney, David Michael Cantor, and her home
weren't immediately returned. The Arizona Republic reported on its
Web site that Elliott left Phoenix on Thursday for a media interview
in New York.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities said the Rodeo fire was started by Leonard Gregg, 29,
who pleaded not guilty to federal charges July 3 and awaits trial.
Gregg, a part-time firefighter and resident of the economically
depressed reservation, set fire to dry grass in hopes of earning $8
an hour as part of a fire crew, according to court documents.</TE>
<TE>   His arrest touched a nerve on the reservation, where some
officials said Gregg was being singled out while Elliott remained
free.</TE>
<TE>   Reno Johnson, chief of staff for the chairman of the White
Mountain Apache Tribe, said most tribal members would feel
disappointed by the decision.</TE>
<TE>   He called it unfair to charge a tribal member in the Rodeo fire
while declining to prosecute the white woman who set the Chediski
fire.</TE>

<DL>LAS VEGAS</DL>
<LD>A judge has dropped all charges against an Arizona man who was the
only one arrested in a Laughlin casino melee April 27 between rival
motorcycle gangs that left three bikers dead.</LD>
<LD>   Laughlin Justice Court Judge Billy Moma signed the prosecutors'
motion to dismiss the charges Thursday, releasing 32-year-old Calvin
Brett Schaefer of all 13 felony charges, including conspiracy,
attempted murder and gang murder, a court clerk confirmed.
Prosecutors had said the charges carried a maximum prison term of
life without parole.</LD>
<LD>   "All the charges are dropped and bail is fully exonerated," said
David Chesnoff, Schaefer's Las Vegas attorney. "He's a free man."</LD>
<TE>   Clark County prosecutors dropped the charges because they could
not give Schaefer's attorneys copies of videotapes of the brawl
without jeopardizing the ongoing investigation, Chesnoff said.</TE>
<TE>   Chesnoff said charges could be brought against Schaefer again.</TE>

<LD>   The fossilized skull of a flying reptile from the time of the
dinosaurs shows it sported an impressive bony crest and may have
lived on fish captured while skimming the surface of a steamy
Southern Hemisphere lagoon.</LD>
<TE>   In a study appearing today in the journal Science, researchers say
the fossil, found in northern Brazil, is from a previously unknown
kind of pterosaur, a reptile that flew on furry wings, dipping and
diving as it caught fish.</TE>
<TE>   Scientists said the animal, which they named Thalassodromeus
sethi, lived about 110 million years ago. Its 4-foot-long skull was
topped with a 31-inch bony crest that may have acted as a rudder.</TE>

<HD>Bush Gives Polish President Taste of Middle America</HD>
<DH>Diplomacy: A tour in Michigan spotlights the role of
immigrants in the U.S. But there may have been a domestic political
element as well.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>EDWIN CHEN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>ROCHESTER, Mich.</DL>
<LD>When he travels abroad, President Bush rarely bothers to do any
sightseeing. Yet when he rolls out the red carpet for a visiting head
of state, Bush expects his guest to be a good tourist.</LD>
<LD>   So it was that on Thursday, he brought Polish President Aleksander
Kwasniewski to this Detroit suburb for a taste of Middle America and
a warm reception from Polish Americans.</LD>
<LD>   ''I believe you have to go beyond Washington to truly capture the
energy and diversity of our country,'' Bush explained. ''I thought it
was a perfect place for him to come.''</LD>
<TE>   Bush was right.</TE>
<TE>   Commenting on the trip, Kwasniewski said, ''You can feel
immediately that you are like at home, among friends, among members
of your family.''</TE>
<TE>   Last September, Bush applied the same hit-the-road formula for the
only other official state visit so far in his administration, that of
Mexican President Vicente Fox.</TE>
<TE>   After the usual pomp and circumstance at the White House, capped
by a lavish state dinner, Bush took Fox to Toledo, Ohio, the next
morning. Their audience included a large group of migrant workers
from Mexico. Bush and Fox also visited a community center in a
lower-income, predominantly Latino neighborhood that was part of a
Mexican American community that dates to the 1930s.</TE>
<TE>   For Bush, there is a dual rationale behind such jaunts.</TE>
<TE>   One is to extol the contributions made by immigrants from the
country of the visiting dignitary. But there also is a domestic
political element.</TE>
<TE>   The Detroit area's large concentrations of Polish Americans, for
instance, traditionally vote Democratic in a state that often becomes
a key battleground in presidential elections. Bush lost Michigan in
the 2000 election to Al Gore, 51% to 46%, and the White House would
like to change that outcome in 2004.</TE>
<TE>   Bush and Kwasniewski began their Michigan visit at Oakland
University, where they spoke in a large gymnasium filled with about
4,000 adoring guests--and some Bush detractors.</TE>
<TE>   When the president began talking about the war on terrorism and
thanked Poland for its contributions, the protesters leapt to their
feet and chanted: ''Stop your war.'' They also produced two banners,
both referring to the disputed presidential election.</TE>
<TE>   One simply read: ''Thief.'' The other--not fully unfurled before
security agents hustled them out--said in part: ''Can you say
election?''</TE>
<TE>   Bush continued speaking during the interruption, at one point
glowering at his detractors as he held up his right hand, as if
compelling them to stop.</TE>
<TE>   After they were escorted out, the audience gave Bush a prolonged
and thunderous ovation as he stressed his commitment to the war
against terrorists. He said the United States and its allies will
''get them on the run--and we're going to keep them on the run until
we bring them to justice.''</TE>
<TE>   Mostly, the remarks by both presidents consisted of mutual praise
and admiration, and much talk of friendship and cooperation.</TE>
<TE>   Bush pointedly thanked Poland for helping to ''bring down the evil
empire,'' the phrase President Reagan popularized when referring to
the Soviet Union in the 1980s. The political movement led by Poland's
anti-Communist Solidarity trade union in the early 1980s helped
undermine Soviet power.</TE>
<TE>   After their remarks, the two presidents traveled in a motorcade to
nearby Troy for lunch at the Polish Cultural Center with about 450
Polish American leaders.</TE>
<TE>   The menu there was quite a contrast to Wednesday night's state
dinner honoring Kwasniewski at the White House. That meal featured
seared striped bass, pepper smoked beef filet, fresh corn polenta,
grilled portobella mushrooms and orange and avocado salad, as well as
three different wines.</TE>
<TE>   The cuisine in Troy included meat-filled potato dumplings, stuffed
cabbage with mushroom sauce, pork tenderloin, cucumber salad with
sour cream and Polish torte.</TE>
<TE>   About 1 million Polish Americans live in Michigan, mostly in and
around Detroit. In all, there are 9 million to 10 million Polish
Americans in the United States</TE>
<TE>   For all his praise of Polish Americans who live in Michigan, Bush
proved unable to keep a lid on his pride for Texas.</TE>
<TE>   ''The oldest permanent Polish settlement in America can be found
in my home state,'' the president noted during Wednesday's state
dinner, referring to Panna Maria in Central Texas.</TE>

<HD>Mrs. O'Leary's Cow, Meet the Asian Carp</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ERIC SLATER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>CHICAGO</DL>
<LD>At the rate of 35 miles a year, the carp have migrated north, leaping
so high at times they have smacked the boat-borne fishermen and
researchers in the face.</LD>
<LD>   They are almost here now and, beyond their unexplained aerial
assaults, pose what biologists believe may be a major ecological
threat to North America's largest water system.</LD>
<LD>   Fat, voracious and with a complexion only a dermatologist could
love, Asian carp are just 25 miles from this city's downtown entryway
to the Great Lakes. The only thing standing in their way is an
experimental electrical curtain.</LD>
<TE>   As long as 5 feet and weighing up to 110 pounds, the carp eat as
much as half their body weight daily in plankton, the same food
virtually every other fish in the lakes eats when it is young. They
breed so quickly that Australian biologists call them "river
rabbits."</TE>
<TE>   "They could essentially wipe out the base of the food chain in the
entire Great Lakes," said Dennis Shornak of the International Joint
Commission, which oversees water systems that affect both the United
States and Canada. "We could honestly end up in a situation where the
Great Lakes are nothing more than a carp pond."</TE>
<TE>   With the fish approaching, the commission has taken to lobbying
the highest levels of the U.S. and Canadian governments for help,
including Secretary of State Colin L. Powell, since the issue is of
international concern. But many fishery biologists are skeptical that
the carp can now be kept out of the Great Lakes and are beginning to
consider how to mitigate the damage.</TE>
<TE>   Mitigation has become the less-than-ideal method of battling other
invasive species that couldn't be kept out of the Great Lakes, such
as the zebra mussel, which made its way from Europe in the 1980s,
transported in the ballast water of ships.</TE>
<TE>   No longer does anyone expect to rid the lakes of zebra mussels,
only to continue fighting the creatures, which attach themselves to
ship hulls, bridge pilings, other mussels and drinking-water intake
systems. The bill for fighting the mussels throughout the lakes: $3
billion in just a decade.</TE>
<TE>   Asian carp, scientists fear, could do exponentially more damage
than zebra mussels or any other of a handful of invasive species in
the Great Lakes, including sea lampreys, which decimated trout
populations 50 years ago. They are likely to compete for food with
such commercial fish as paddlefish, gizzard shad, bigmouth buffalo,
and virtually every other fish while they're in a larval stage. And
once they get in, there is no getting them out.</TE>
<TE>   They pose another problem. These fish can jump--more than 12 feet
out of the water.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not a phenomenon you have to wait for," said Pam Thiel, a
fishery expert for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service in La Crosse,
Wis. "Just go to a place where they are dense and they will be
flying."</TE>
<TE>   A most impressive sight, from afar.</TE>
<TE>   "They don't mix well with water-skiers, jet-skiers and boaters,"
Thiel added.</TE>
<TE>   Some commercial fishermen have taken to protecting themselves from
incoming carp with cookie sheets or garbage can lids. A fisherman on
the Kaskaskia River in southern Illinois suffered a broken nose when
one leaped into his face.</TE>
<TE>   Virtually every researcher for the Illinois Natural History
Survey, which studies area fisheries, has taken at least one carp
hit, said Kevin Irons, a river ecologist with the group. One
ichthyologist, who already had been whacked several times, was
injured so badly during a recent flying-carp encounter that he is
receiving medical treatment.</TE>
<TE>   With large, mottled scales and eyes that seem to have slid halfway
down their faces, Asian carp are considered trash fish of the lowest
order in the West.</TE>
<TE>   Although their white, low-oil meat is rather tasty, many agree,
the fish--probably because it is a carp--has never gained a market in
North America beyond the Chinatowns in a few major cities. And even
where there is a market, the fish must be trucked there alive
because, as with lobsters, connoisseurs prefer them fresh.</TE>
<TE>   The much-maligned carp do have a place to call home. Halfway
around the world in East Asia, the arrival of a migratory school
would likely be greeted not by an electric shock but a celebration.</TE>
<TE>   In much of China, carp are not only a food staple but symbols of
strength for their mythic ability to leap the entire rapids of the
Yellow River, and perseverance for their actual talent at swimming
upstream. They are common images in watercolors and other artwork,
often pictured leaping high out of the water, twisting in the air
with gusto and grace.</TE>
<TE>   Two species of Asian carp, bighead and silver, are the primary
cause of concern here. Imported by Arkansas fish farmers in the early
1970s for their skill as underwater vacuums, the carp were slipped
into catfish ponds to gobble up algae blooms.</TE>
<TE>   The fish escaped, as it were, during heavy floods in the early
1990s, making their way out of the ponds and into tributaries of the
Mississippi River. They swiftly swam north.</TE>
<TE>   In 1999, according to a study by the Natural History Survey,
researchers found not a single bighead carp in the Illinois River, a
tributary of the Mississippi River, though they were appearing with
ever-increasing frequency downstream in the Mississippi. The next
year the scientists discovered more than 1,400 of the fish at a
single site in the Illinois.</TE>
<TE>   "They went from being nonexistent to being one of the most common
fish in the river," Irons said. "We don't know much about these guys
yet. What we do know is an adult female will lay millions of eggs a
year, and the populations have the potential to grow dramatically."</TE>
<TE>   The Illinois connects to the Chicago River, which connects to Lake
Michigan, which in turn connects directly or indirectly to all of the
other Great Lakes. The carp migration is now less than a year's swim
from Lake Michigan, though individual fish could make the trek in a
day or two.</TE>
<TE>   The Army Corps of Engineers is trying to halt their progress with
an electrical current at a site in the Chicago Sanitary and Ship
Canal. In April, the corps laid a series of charged cables across the
artificial bottom of the canal and flipped the switch, sending a
current that the fish find less than pleasant all the way to the
surface.</TE>
<TE>   The unproven electrical curtain, however, doesn't even have a
generator in case of a power outage--a regular summertime occurrence
in Chicago.</TE>
<TE>   Such electrical walls have proved effective in the laboratory and
in small natural settings in turning fish back, but they have never
been employed on anything close to this scale. Chicago Mayor Richard
M. Daley is asking Congress for $700,000 for a generator to keep the
curtain live in case of a blackout, and to build a second barrier,
perhaps using bubbles or a wall of sound to keep the carp at bay.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, many researchers believe it entirely likely that some
fish could simply jump the barrier.</TE>
<TE>   Ironically, if it were not for a massive tinkering with nature
more than a century ago, the fish would have no way of swimming from
the Mississippi into the Great Lakes in the first place.</TE>
<TE>   The Chicago River, which runs through the heart of the city, used
to have no connection with the Mississippi drainage. And it used to
flow in the other direction.</TE>
<TE>   In the late 19th century, Chicago dumped its sewage, waste water
and the carcasses from its sprawling slaughterhouses into the Chicago
River, which flowed into Lake Michigan. The problem was, the city
also obtained its drinking water from Lake Michigan. Chicagoans were
dying in droves from the poisoned lake water.</TE>
<TE>   With large-scale environmental consciousness still decades in the
future, the city and federal governments decided not to clean up the
river but to turn it around, sending all the fetid materials west,
into the Mississippi.</TE>
<TE>   Workers built a lock at the river's entrance to Lake Michigan, dug
a series of artificial canals connecting to the Illinois River, and
reversed the Chicago River's flow.</TE>
<TE>   With the carp almost here, scientists are considering every
option, including one being tested in Australia, where several
waterways have been invaded: gender selection.</TE>
<TE>   Altering an enzyme in female carp that helps determine sex, the
Australian scientists are seeing whether they can get carp mothers to
give birth to considerably more males than females. In theory, the
ratio of male to female carp would grow so lopsided in favor of the
males that the population would collapse.</TE>
<TE>   That's only in theory, however. Even on paper, the method takes
decades to play out.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, scientists here are hoping for funding to build the
redundant barrier not far from the existing one, near the Chicago
suburb of Romeoville, in case the initial wall doesn't stop the carp.
Researchers for the Natural History Survey frequently send electric
charges into the water to stun fish and bring them to the surface for
study. Irons, who pilots a research boat, has installed a special mat
that he stands on while at the wheel.</TE>
<TE>   If a carp knocks him into the water, the sudden reduction in
weight on the pad will shut down any electric currents the scientists
are sending into the river, so he won't be electrocuted.</TE>
<TE>   "I had one come at me like a football recently--and this is a six-
or seven-pound fish," Irons said. "Man, this one was a missile."</TE>

<HD>White House Rejects Democrats' Medicare Prescription Drug
Plan</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The Bush administration on Thursday rejected a 10-year, $594-billion
plan by Senate Democrats to provide a Medicare prescription drug
benefit, saying it could lead to hefty new taxes on Americans.</LD>
<LD>   "The supporters have not proposed any way to pay for the bill's
unsustainable costs," the administration said in a statement.</LD>
<LD>   Democrats initially estimated the bill would cost up to $500
billion. The Congressional Budget Office late Thursday put the figure
at $594 billion but said that could drop by about $10 billion if
Congress passes a bill making generic drugs more available.</LD>
<TE>   The administration said the cost of the Democratic plan would
require the government to increase taxes, cut all government programs
or drain the Medicare trust fund early.</TE>
<TE>   The White House instead supports a $370-billion plan put forth by
a group of Republicans, Democrats and independents.</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.) said the administration's
position "lets down the millions of Americans struggling with high
drug prices and who deserve a Medicare prescription drug benefit that
truly helps all seniors."</TE>

<HD>Death Row Reforms Go to Senate</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Legislation to reform the death penalty by giving people on death row
access to DNA testing and improving the quality of lawyers in capital
cases was backed by a key Senate committee Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   The Senate Judiciary Committee approved the "Innocence Protection
Act" by a 12-7 vote, with all the Democrats and two Republicans
backing it.</LD>
<LD>   The bill now goes to the full Senate.</LD>
<TE>   Parallel legislation has been proposed in the House .</TE>
<TE>   The legislation comes amid growing debate about the administration
of the death penalty since its reinstatement in the 1970s.</TE>
<TE>   More than 100 people in 24 states have been released from death
row since 1973, two states have enacted moratoriums on executions and
the Supreme Court has issued two recent rulings curtailing the
penalty's use.</TE>
<TE>   The bill would give people convicted of federal capital crimes
access to post-conviction DNA testing and require states to set up
similar systems to qualify for certain federal funds.</TE>
<TE>   It would also give states grants to improve the quality of legal
counsel in death penalty cases to put an end to what Judiciary
Committee Chairman Patrick J. Leahy, a Vermont Democrat, called the
"sleeping lawyer syndrome," a reference to some cases in which
lawyers have dozed off in capital cases.</TE>
<TE>   It would also guarantee that if the Supreme Court agrees to hear a
death penalty appeal, it has to automatically grant a stay of
execution, ending what Leahy called a "bizarre spectacle" of the high
court agreeing to hear a case after the execution date.</TE>

<HD>Coming to an Army Near You</HD>
<DH>In Marina del Rey, the low-profile Institute for Creative
Technology asks Hollywood types to concoct battle scenes to help the
military train.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DANA CALVO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Three big-name Hollywood talents huddle around a conference table and
let the ideas fly.</LD>
<LD>   "Apocalypse Now" co-writer John Milius sketches a soldier of the
future with a Transformer-like weapon that doubles as a vehicle part.</LD>
<LD>   David Ayer, who wrote "Training Day," suggests building sensors
that link every weapon system in the country.</LD>
<TE>   Ron Cobb, the creature designer for "Star Wars," describes a
personnel carrier with four independent steering wheels that could
"whip around and is buffered with lots of shields."</TE>
<TE>   This Hollywood brainstorming session will never produce something
for the neighborhood megaplex. That's because it took place not on a
studio lot but inside a nondescript Army think tank on a quiet street
in Marina del Rey.</TE>
<TE>   The Institute for Creative Technology is the country's only
organization that draws on entertainment industry know-how to sharpen
military training through futuristic games and simulation. The
institute's Hollywood consultants also write story lines for
virtual-reality military training videos--plots with swirling
suspense and drama that aim to make a soldier's training more
compelling.</TE>
<TE>   Since it was founded in 1999, the institute has popped in and out
of public view, vacillating between the military's need-to-know
tradition of secrecy and Hollywood's need-to-dish culture. Most
recently, it drew national notice when it asked screenwriters,
producers and directors to generate terrorist scenarios in the wake
of the Sept. 11 attacks.</TE>
<TE>   Their ideas have been kept under wraps; one Army spokeswoman cited
national security in declining to release them.</TE>
<TE>   From the outside, the office building looks as forgettable as a
1970s bank. Inside is another story. The interiors were created by
Paramount's Herman Zimmerman, who was in charge of production design
for several "Star Trek" movies and TV series. The blond wood walls
pitch toward the ceiling, a la the Starship Enterprise, and automatic
pocket doors pull apart down the middle and close back up again with
that unmistakable shush.</TE>
<TE>   While the institute has Hollywood and military consultants on
retainer, there are 45 full-time scientists, researchers and
administrators who work in offices equipped with bunk beds.</TE>
<TE>   "They bring in people with diverse backgrounds: artificial
intelligence, video game people, social research people," Ayer said.
"It's like the most amazing dinner party."</TE>
<TE>   This "party" costs the Army $45 million in a five-year contract,
and millions more come from other military branches. Hollywood
consultants are paid anywhere from $500 to $1,000 a day, although
most work only a few days a month.</TE>
<TE>   "It's decent pay," Ayer said, "but it's not Hollywood
scriptwriting pay."</TE>
<TE>   In all, Ayer and his fellow out-of-the-box thinkers pull about $1
million a year from ICT's budget. But the money moves both ways
between the Pentagon and Hollywood. Paramount pledged $600,000 for a
virtual-reality theater called ALTSim (Advanced Leadership Training
Simulation); the studio can repackage elements of the technology into
commercial games. And the institute already has received most of the
$3.3 million promised for a game project by game developer Pandemic
Studios and Sony Pictures Imageworks, one of the leading digital labs
in the country.</TE>
<TE>   Ties to USC</TE>
<TE>   and Hollywood</TE>
<TE>   The institute is affiliated with USC, which has provided up to $2
million in graphics technology and dozens of student interns during
the summer. The Army's other futuristic university-affiliated
research center is the Institute for Advanced Technology, founded at
the University of Texas at Austin in 1994 with a five-year contract
to study lethality and weaponry. While the Texas institution relies
on medical, science and arms experts, much of ICT's expertise comes
straight from Hollywood.</TE>
<TE>   "It says a lot about our military that they don't feel
sufficiently comfortable thinking out of the box and they have to go
outside of themselves for that advice," said Christopher Hellman,
senior analyst at the Center for Defense Initiatives, a nonprofit,
independent think tank in Washington, D.C. "They need someone without
that baggage to think almost whimsically about their structure."</TE>
<TE>   The premise for this type of collaboration is not new; the
military and Hollywood have long helped each other, most recently
with extensive technical support from the Pentagon on military-themed
movies like "Black Hawk Down," "Behind Enemy Lines" and "The Sum of
All Fears." And just last week, the head of research and development
at Walt Disney Co. announced he was leaving to head all research at
the Pentagon's National Security Agency.</TE>
<TE>   The Army keeps tabs on ICT through daily e-mails with its
executive staff and extensive monthly reports. Many of its Hollywood
consultants say the institute provides welcome distance from the
entertainment industry's relentless emphasis on generating commercial
hits.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't find the film entertainment world that liberating. It's
pretty formulaic," said onetime Hollywood producer and writer Jim
Korris, who serves as ICT's creative director. "Entertainment
companies don't reward innovation."</TE>
<TE>   Some view the institute with suspicion, envisioning something out
of the 1997 movie comedy "Wag the Dog," in which the White House
recruited Hollywood's best spin doctors and a few technical wizards
to stage a phony war to squelch news of the president's mistress.</TE>
<TE>   "There is a power elite, and it's Hollywood-Washington-Pentagon,"
said James Der Derian, author of "Virtuous War: Mapping the
Military-Industrial-Media-Entertainment Network" (2001). "They
created this ICT to create scenarios for the future of war, but what
Hollywood gets out of it, of course, is whiz-bang technologies."</TE>
<TE>   A. Michael Andrews II, the Army's chief scientist and the
institute's founder, said one of its finest hours came after last
fall's terrorist attacks.</TE>
<TE>   "Since we had such a very unusual action against the United
States, I thought it might be worthwhile to look outside our normal
way of thinking about the problem," Andrews said. He asked ICT to
corral entertainment industry volunteers who could dream up terrorist
plot lines in hopes they might expose a weakness in the real-life
anti-terrorism network.</TE>
<TE>   This panel of about 30 Hollywood volunteers, some of whom were
already institute consultants, met during two evenings in October,
creating terrorist "characters" and then following the story lines
through. They wanted to know what tools were available to the
soldiers who would be exploring unlit caves. They also wanted to know
what was being done to deter the hypothetical terrorist characters.</TE>
<TE>   "It was ad hoc; a number of people asked to participate for a
limited period of time," said David Engelbach, a former writer for
the "MacGyver" TV series. Engelbach, like several other writers
contacted for this story, declined to discuss his contributions,
saying he had been asked by the Pentagon to keep his ideas
confidential.</TE>
<TE>   Cobb, the conceptual set designer for sci-fi movies such as "Star
Wars" and "Aliens," said the sessions proved Hollywood's dreamers
could collaborate with the Pentagon's heavyweights. "I think we
impressed the military, who probably thought we were all flakes."</TE>
<TE>   Military Training</TE>
<TE>   as Entertainment</TE>
<TE>   ICT began, as most Hollywood projects do, with a "meeting on the
lot." It was 1999, and the lot was Paramount.</TE>
<TE>   Andrews, who has a doctorate in electrical engineering, arrived
with a picture of a bridge arching between the Pentagon and the
Hollywood sign. To Korris, accustomed to high-tech gadgets and slick
presentations, it looked both clumsy and endearing.</TE>
<TE>   Andrews held up his paper-and-glue visual aid and explained that
he wanted to immerse soldiers in training that would be as convincing
as silver-screen entertainment. He wanted the soldier to feel, smell
and react in real time to the scenario.</TE>
<TE>   "The military had very accurate, big training exercises, but it
wasn't entertaining," Korris said. "That's a problem for the young
recruits. Andrews wanted to come up with training technologies that
might be more interesting."</TE>
<TE>   At its opening ceremony at the Marina del Rey offices on Sept. 26,
2000, the audience was packed with top military brass as well as
Hollywood's chief lobbyist, Jack Valenti, head of the Motion Picture
Assn. of America. Within a few months, ICT had attracted an array of
consultants who don't fit neatly into Hollywood's left-leaning image.</TE>
<TE>   Ayer spent two years in the Navy as a sonar man aboard a nuclear
submarine. Cobb fought in the Vietnam War. And Milius is a proud
hawk.</TE>
<TE>   "They haven't sent me to Afghanistan," Milius said, "but I'm
waiting."</TE>
<TE>   Other Hollywood consultants at ICT include Paul De Meo,
co-writer of "The Rocketeer," and veteran director Randal Kleiser, whose
credits stretch back to "Grease" and "The Blue Lagoon."</TE>
<TE>   They are overseen by Executive Director Richard Lindheim, the
former executive vice president of Paramount Television Group.
Korris, the creative director, is a former producer at Ron Howard's
production company, Imagine, and a longtime writer for episodic
television shows such as "Murder, She Wrote," "Simon &amp; Simon" and
"Miami Vice."</TE>
<TE>   But David Williams, vice president of policy for the watchdog
group Citizens Against Government Waste, is not impressed with the
Tinseltown resumes.</TE>
<TE>   Williams wonders how the Pentagon could justify spending a million
dollars a year on Hollywood consultants.</TE>
<TE>   "Aren't there a few out-of-work writers who could do it for
cheaper? A million dollars in the scheme of the federal budget isn't
much, but a million dollars is still a million dollars," he said. "A
few years ago, the Pentagon was working on caffeinated gum, and I put
this in the same category."</TE>

<HD>Federal Screeners Are Now on Duty at JFK</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN J. GOLDMAN and RICARDO ALONSO-ZALDIVAR</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>The federal Transportation Security Administration has quietly begun
screening passengers at New York's John F. Kennedy International
Airport, the busiest airport yet to shift away from private security.</LD>
<LD>   Teams from the air security agency began operating at three JFK
terminals on July 9, the day President Bush traveled here to address
business leaders about the scandals that have shaken the stock
market. The airport handled 29.4 million passengers and 1.4 million
tons of cargo last year.</LD>
<LD>   As a principal gateway to the nation's largest city, Kennedy
International has always enjoyed a high profile, which has only been
magnified by concerns following the terrorist attack on the World
Trade Center. Those concerns were further heightened this week when
police in Spain arrested three suspected members of Al Qaeda who
possessed extensive surveillance videotapes of possible terrorist
targets in the United States.</LD>
<TE>   Sources said the tapes contained footage of Kennedy International.</TE>
<TE>   Nico Melendez, a spokesman for the Transportation Security
Administration, said the deployment took place earlier this month,
adding that a key priority at Kennedy is recruiting enough screeners
who can meet federal requirements and complete training.</TE>
<TE>   The government plans to hire more than 50,000 screeners by Nov. 19
to operate metal detectors and run sophisticated explosives-detection
equipment at 429 airports. Both the task and the deadline are
daunting. Passengers at U.S. airports check 1 billion bags a year.</TE>
<TE>   A federal security director also will be hired for each airport.</TE>
<TE>   Many of the new federal screeners at Kennedy received on-the-job
training at the Baltimore-Washington International Airport, where the
new federal system made its debut earlier this year.</TE>
<TE>   One lesson from that experience is that significant differences
exist among airports that can affect security.</TE>
<TE>   After the screeners found that some metal detectors were being
unplugged at BWI, the decision was made to hard-wire the machines
into the ceiling. But the Transportation Security Administration
found that this would be impossible at some airports because their
ceilings are too high.</TE>

<HD>Alaskan Glaciers Melting Faster Than Once Thought</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Alaska's glaciers are melting at more than twice the rate previously
assumed because of warming temperatures, a disturbing phenomenon that
is dramatically altering the majestic contours of the state and
driving up sea levels, according to a new study.</LD>
<LD>   Scientists using highly precise airborne laser measurements of 67
Alaskan glaciers from the mid-1950s to the mid-1990s discovered that
the glaciers are melting an average of 6 feet a year--and in some
cases a couple hundred feet--and that the rate has accelerated in the
last seven or eight years.</LD>
<LD>   "The next question is: What has been causing this glacier
thinning? Is it because there is less snowfall in the winter or are
the summers warmer?" said Anthony A. Arendt, one of the researchers.
"Glacier changes are linked to the climate, so this indicates that
something has changed about the Alaskan climate."</LD>
<TE>   The study by a team of researchers from the University of Alaska
in Fairbanks, published in today's issue of the journal Science,
offers a vivid and troubling picture of the potential adverse effect
of climate change on the United States and the rest of the world.</TE>
<TE>   As one measure of the severity of the problem, the researchers
calculated that the glaciers are generating nearly twice the annual
meltage of the Greenland Ice Sheet, the largest ice mass in the
Northern Hemisphere and second only to the Antarctic. That would mean
the Alaskan melt is adding about .008 of an inch a year to the sea
levels, which could have long-term implications for flooding on
Pacific islands and along coastal areas, the researchers concluded.</TE>
<TE>   "The change we are seeing is more rapid than any climate change
that has happened in the last 10 to 20 centuries," said Keith
Echelmeyer, one of the five researchers who prepared the study.</TE>
<TE>   Scientists can't say whether the extraordinary melting is the
result of man-induced global warming, the slow natural advance and
rapid retreat of the glaciers, or dramatic but natural variations in
global weather patterns. But the effects are illustrative of what
some scientists and environmentalists predict will happen at home and
abroad unless the United States and the rest of the world undertake a
more aggressive effort to reduce carbon dioxide and other
heat-trapping gases.</TE>
<TE>   "We're getting to the point that this melting is affecting human
society," said Janine Bloomfield, a climate expert with Environmental
Defense, a New York-based advocacy group. "Until now, it was just
warning signs and signals that the Earth was warming."</TE>
<TE>   The study has provided fresh evidence for Alaskan officials,
researchers and environmentalists who say their state has become the
poster child for the ills of global warming. Over the last 30 years
alone, the annual mean temperature in Alaska has risen 5.4
degrees--four times the average global increase, according to the
University of Alaska's Center for Global Change and Arctic System
Research.</TE>
<TE>   As the state's pervasive permafrost begins to thaw, the
consequences are dramatic and are seen as alarming: sagging roads,
crumbling villages, sinking pipelines, the proliferation of insects
that are destroying spruce forests and the possible disruption of
marine wildlife. Some Alaskans talk about "drunken trees" that list
and show their roots because of the rapid decline of the permafrost.</TE>

<HD>'20th Hijacker' Suspect Tries Guilty Plea</HD>
<DH>Hearing: Zacarias Moussaoui is told by the court that he
will be given a week to decide whether he really wants to admit to
capital case.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ERIC LICHTBLAU and JOSH MEYER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>ALEXANDRIA, Va.</DL>
<LD>Zacarias Moussaoui, the alleged "20th hijacker," told a stunned
federal courtroom Thursday that he wants to plead guilty to terrorism
charges because he is a member of Al Qaeda and pledges his loyalty to
Osama bin Laden.</LD>
<LD>   U.S. District Judge Leonie Brinkema, startled by the unusual
maneuver, refused to accept the plea at what was supposed to be a
routine hearing. Instead, she told the French-Moroccan defendant that
she will give him a week to contemplate whether he really wants to
admit guilt to capital charges that could result in his execution.</LD>
<LD>   "Bet on me," an enraged Moussaoui responded. "I will."</LD>
<TE>   The exchange capped a hearing that was tumultuous even compared to
past standards set by the unpredictable Moussaoui. He shouted at the
judge, interrupted her repeatedly, mocked her instructions and raised
his arm in a prolonged gesture of defiance as she tried to settle him
down.</TE>
<TE>   Legal observers have predicted for weeks that Moussaoui's
prosecution would turn into a legal circus once the defendant won the
right to defend himself, and many said Thursday's hearing confirmed
their fears.</TE>
<TE>   "This is the nightmare we all anticipated once he decided he
wanted to represent himself," said former Deputy Atty. Gen. Eric H.
Holder Jr.</TE>
<TE>   Even before his surprise attempt to plead guilty, Brinkema warned
Moussaoui that he was hurting his own case by filing dozens of often
repetitive motions since the judge granted him the right to defend
himself.</TE>
<TE>   On an almost daily basis in recent weeks, Moussaoui has filed
handwritten pleadings with the court that proclaim his innocence,
condemn America, Jews and the judicial system, and accuse Brinkema,
U.S. prosecutors and his former defense attorneys of conspiring to
have him killed.</TE>
<TE>   "It is a waste of your time ... and the court's resources for you
to keep raising the same issues again and again.... I'm putting you
on notice that I don't expect any more of these motions to be filed,"
Brinkema said.</TE>
<TE>   She said the motions call into question his competence and, if
they continue, she may be forced to reconsider her decision to let
him act as his own attorney.</TE>
<TE>   Moussaoui predicted that the judge will end up doing just that in
an effort to railroad him. "I will be gagged, and you will carry out
your so-called justice," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Moussaoui faces the death penalty if he is convicted on charges of
taking part in the Sept. 11 conspiracy. He was imprisoned in
Minnesota on an immigration violation at the time of the terrorist
attacks, but authorities say his activities--accepting a $14,000 wire
transfer from a terrorist suspect and taking flight training in
Minnesota--mirrored those of the hijackers. Authorities allege that
he was destined to be the 20th hijacker had he not been incarcerated.</TE>
<TE>   Moussaoui offered a wildly contradictory defense Thursday,
declaring on the one hand that he had nothing to do with Sept. 11 and
proclaiming his terrorist allegiances on the other.</TE>
<TE>   When asked by Brinkema at the start of Thursday's hearing how he
wished to plead to a new indictment that lays out more detailed death
penalty allegations against him, Moussaoui said he would offer "an
affirmative plea," offering a definition he had found in Black's Law
Dictionary.</TE>
<TE>   Brinkema said such a plea is not recognized in federal criminal
courts, and she entered a not guilty plea on his behalf. But the
hearing became more contentious, and later Moussaoui shouted out: "I
didn't make this plea!"</TE>
<TE>   Then he proclaimed his guilt.</TE>
<TE>   "I, Moussaoui Zacarias, with full knowledge, enter a plea of
guilty. I am a member of Al Qaeda. I pledge bayat [loyalty] to Osama
bin Laden," he said as Brinkema cut him off, warning that he was
making incriminating statements that could be used in court.</TE>
<TE>   He said he was not involved in the hijackings but that he knew who
was. And he said he wants to skip the guilt phase of his trial, now
scheduled to start Sept. 30, and go straight to the penalty phase to
determine whether he should be executed.</TE>
<TE>   "Now I'm saying for the guilt phase, I'm guilty, but for the death
penalty, we will see," he said. "I am guilty. Now the question is how
much."</TE>
<TE>   His declaration left the courtroom abuzz as his former defense
attorneys--now appointed by the court as "stand-by counsel" to assist
in his defense, even though Moussaoui won't speak to them--shook
their heads.</TE>
<TE>   Stand-by counsel Gerald Zerkin, asked by a reporter what he
thought of Moussaoui's attempted plea, said: "He's insane. You
haven't figured out yet that he's crazy?"</TE>
<TE>   Brinkema said she expects to question Moussaoui in court next week
to determine whether he understands the nature of the charges and
whether you "absolutely want to enter a guilty plea."</TE>
<TE>   Alan H. Yamamoto, also appointed as a stand-by counsel, said he
believes it will be difficult for the judge to accept a guilty plea.</TE>
<TE>   "She's not obligated to take the plea. She's going to be
hard-pressed to accept it, based on all of the contradictory
statements he's made," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Holder, the No. 2 deputy to former Atty. Gen. Janet Reno, said:
"The judge and the Justice Department have a lot of tough choices to
make."</TE>
<TE>   The judge must weigh whether to reverse herself and prevent
Moussaoui from representing himself, which she can do by declaring
him incapable of adequately defending himself. Such a decision could
prompt appeals and questions as to whether Brinkema deprived
Moussaoui of his right to represent himself.</TE>
<TE>   "The baseline is competency, but beyond that, not every sane
person is capable of conducting a defense," said Holder. "What the
judge really has to decide here is, given the way he has conducted
himself, whether he has the capability to mount a defense. She
doesn't have to let him legally commit suicide in court.</TE>
<TE>   "The toughest choice is with the judge. How does she handle this?
I would not be surprised if after their next interaction, she decides
he is mentally competent but is not capable of defending himself and
forces him to accept counsel," said Holder. The Justice Department
also has a dilemma: whether to allow Moussaoui to essentially convict
himself or to try to negotiate a deal with him to find out what he
knows about the conspiracy and as-yet-unidentified accomplices in the
Sept. 11 attacks, Holder said.</TE>
<TE>   "If this guy pleads guilty, certainly you [agree to] do that and
you go through the penalty phase. But what if he wants to negotiate a
deal?" Holder asked. "He is the one guy we have in our custody who is
a co-conspirator, who clearly has dealt with other people involved in
this. In that regard, he is very valuable. But you have to contrast
that with the fact that he was involved in a conspiracy that killed
3,000 people."</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, Brinkema told Moussaoui that by declaring he wants to
plead guilty, he may be compromising his ability to strike a plea
bargain and get a lighter sentence if he were willing to give up
important information.</TE>
<TE>   Atty. Gen. John Ashcroft has stated publicly that he wants
Moussaoui executed.</TE>
<TE>   Randall Hamud, a lawyer for Moussaoui's mother, said Thursday's
developments proved that Moussaoui cannot get a fair trial unless he
is prevented from representing himself.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it shows he is not rational, that he is delusional and
that he needs to be reevaluated psychologically," said Hamud of San
Diego. "Islam prohibits suicide, and if he pleads guilty it is
tantamount to an act of suicide and goes against his religion. He
contends he is a very devout Muslim, so it is another indication of
his delusional state."</TE>
<TE>   Moussaoui's mother has been waging a campaign to try to get her
son to accept a government-appointed legal team, Hamud said.</TE>

<HD>Popular Rapper Mystikal, 2 Others Charged in Rape</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>BATON ROUGE, La.</DL>
<LD>Top-selling rapper Mystikal and two other men were jailed Thursday on
charges they raped an acquaintance at his house.</LD>
<LD>   Mystikal, whose real name is Michael Tyler, surrendered to
authorities early Thursday and was booked on an aggravated rape
charge, police said.</LD>
<LD>   Leland Ellis, 36, and Vercy Carter, 34, of Baton Rouge, turned
themselves in and were booked later Thursday, police said.</LD>
<TE>   Tyler was released Thursday afternoon on $250,000 bond. Bond had
not been set Thursday evening for either Ellis or Carter.</TE>
<TE>   All three were also charged with extortion. Authorities say they
threatened to tell police that the woman had received checks from the
rapper's account without his permission. The extortion charge accuses
Tyler of demanding sex in exchange for his agreement not to turn the
woman in to police.</TE>
<TE>   If convicted of the aggravated rape charge, Tyler would face a
mandatory life sentence. The penalty for extortion carries a prison
term of one to 15 years.</TE>
<TE>   Tyler's attorneys did not return calls seeking comment, nor did
his record company, Jive.</TE>
<TE>   His hits include "Danger (Been So Long)" and the Grammy-nominated
"Shake Ya ..." The gruff-sounding rapper's latest disc, "Tarantula,"
has gone gold.</TE>
<TE>   Tyler is accused of attacking the 40-year-old woman after she
showed up at his house about 8 p.m. on July 3.</TE>
<TE>   Tyler allegedly called two men over to his house, and when they
showed up, according to police, he raped the woman in front of them,
then each of the others raped her, police said.</TE>

<HD>Accountants Attack Senate Reform Bill</HD>
<DH>Congress: Negotiations continue on a measure to combat
corporate fraud. Industry backs less restrictive version passed by
the House.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD SIMON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>As House and Senate negotiators meet today in an effort to reach
speedy agreement on a corporate reform bill, the accounting industry
is stepping up its lobbying to defeat provisions it regards as too
restrictive.</LD>
<LD>   An e-mail sent Wednesday by the American Institute of Certified
Public Accountants to its members decried the Senate version of the
legislation as overkill. "We cannot allow ... the fierce search for
blame to taint the 350,000 CPAs in this country who stand for
integrity, competence and objectivity," the e-mail said.</LD>
<LD>   The industry group complained that the bill unanimously approved
by the Senate this week "opens the door for profound changes to the
[Securities and Exchange Commission] and the accounting profession."</LD>
<TE>   It expressed support for a less stringent measure approved by the
House this year.</TE>
<TE>   As the Senate bill gathered momentum after the recent wave of
corporate scandals, business lobbyists had said they would fight to
change the measure during the House-Senate negotiations. What's
uncertain is whether the bipartisan push to pass reforms quickly--in
order to guard against the economic and political damage from the
scandals--will keep the lobbyists from having the type of influence
they usually exert.</TE>
<TE>   President Bush has asked Congress to send him an accounting reform
bill before lawmakers adjourn for their August recess.</TE>
<TE>   A major sticking point between the Republican-controlled House and
Democratic-led Senate is a proposal for a new accounting oversight
board.</TE>
<TE>   Under the Senate proposal, the board would operate independently
of the SEC. It would have the power to set auditing and ethics rules
and discipline auditors. The five-member board would be appointed by
the SEC, with two members--but no more--having accounting
backgrounds.</TE>
<TE>   The House bill delegates many of the details of the new board's
authority to the SEC, an agency that critics say has failed to move
aggressively enough to combat corporate crime. House Republicans also
favor a panel with four of the five members having an accounting
background.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. Chamber of Commerce has expressed concerns that the board
proposed by the Senate would "at best duplicate--or at
worst--conflict, with existing SEC oversight, thus confusing business
with respect to the body of rules and regulations to observe and with
which to comply."</TE>
<TE>   Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle (D-S.D.) said Thursday he is
unwilling to compromise on the board proposal. "It has to be
independent," Daschle said.</TE>
<TE>   The accounting industry group said in its e-mail that it had been
working to address concerns about the accounting industry since Enron
Corp.'s collapse late last year. But it said the recent revelation of
accounting irregularities by WorldCom "significantly altered this
landscape and set the stage for the sweeping legislation" that passed
the Senate.</TE>
<TE>   The group said it is particularly concerned about a provision of
the Senate bill that goes beyond the House measure in restricting the
consulting that accounting firms can provide to companies they audit.</TE>
<TE>   The lobbying comes as a key lawmaker urged SEC Chairman Harvey L.
Pitt to permanently recuse himself from agency proceedings involving
former clients.</TE>
<TE>   Rep. Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.) said Pitt's participation in
decisions affecting former clients "would further deepen the crisis
of confidence in the securities markets and call into question the
ability of the commission to be an objective and vigorous enforcer of
the securities laws."</TE>
<TE>   An SEC spokesman declined comment.</TE>
<TE>   Pitt is a former securities lawyer whose clients included each of
the Big Five accounting firms. Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) has called
for Pitt's resignation, contending that his past work has made him
unsuitable for the job.</TE>
<TE>   Pitt agreed to sit out on matters involving former clients during
his first year in office. But as that date nears, he plans to decide
whether to participate in decisions affecting former clients on a
case-by-case basis, a spokeswoman said.</TE>
<TE>   "I intend to continue to adhere to both the letter and the spirit
of the ethics rules. I don't want to do anything that gives our
critics an opportunity to raise issues," Pitt said on CBS' "Face the
Nation" on Sunday. "But the SEC needs my leadership. Public investors
need my leadership.... I'm going to make a case-by-case decision. If
I think there is an appearance issue or some other problem, I may
still recuse myself."</TE>
<TE>   But Markey sent a letter to Pitt urging him to extend his one-year
cooling-off period, due to expire Aug. 3. "Otherwise, Aug. 3 will
mark the day that the many former clients of Chairman Pitt rush to
the SEC to reestablish their 'special relationship' with this
powerful regulator," Markey said.</TE>
<TE>   The White House on Thursday continued to stand by Pitt.</TE>
<TE>   "He's running the SEC in a manner that is wise and in a manner
that is tough," said Press Secretary Ari Fleischer. "The president
has strong confidence in Harvey Pitt's judgment and discretion."</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Phil Gramm of Texas, top Republican on the Senate Banking
Committee, recalled that during Pitt's confirmation hearing,
"everyone lavished praise on Harvey Pitt for all the knowledge and
experience he had, and now you can hardly open a paper without a
criticism being made about him."</TE>

<HD>Judge OKs Shoe-Bomb Suspect's Interrogation as Trial
Evidence</HD>
<DH>Court: Prosecution wins a key victory as the defense's
contention that its client was improperly questioned by officials
after the incident is rejected.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD A. SERRANO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>A federal judge in Boston ruled Thursday that allegedly
self-incriminating statements made by Richard C. Reid can be used in
his trial this fall.</LD>
<LD>   It was a significant victory for prosecutors, who hope to show
that the Muslim militant confessed to attempting to ignite explosives
hidden in his shoes to bring down a crowded airliner over the
Atlantic Ocean.</LD>
<LD>   Judge William G. Young denied assertions by Reid's defense lawyers
that their client was improperly interrogated after the Dec. 22
incident, and he said sedatives administered to the British citizen
after he was subdued on board the plane did not influence him in
deciding to speak to FBI agents.</LD>
<TE>   Because the statements are central to the government's case, the
judge's order is one of the most important rulings in preparation for
the Reid trial, set to begin Nov. 4. In earlier court papers,
prosecutors have said Reid acknowledged his failure to blow up the
jetliner. He also allegedly told federal agents that he knew his
mission would mean either ''death or jail'' for him.</TE>
<TE>   If convicted and given the maximum punishment, Reid could spend
the rest of his life in prison for attempting to kill the 197
passengers and crew members aboard American Airlines Flight 63 from
Paris to Miami.</TE>
<TE>   Reid was subdued by passengers and crew members after a flight
attendant smelled smoke and said it appeared that he was trying to
set his sneakers on fire. The flight, which was over the Atlantic at
the time, was diverted to Boston.</TE>
<TE>   The plane landed at Logan International Airport before 1 p.m. and
four Massachusetts state police officers boarded the aircraft,
handcuffed Reid and removed him, the judge's ruling noted.</TE>
<TE>   Reid was read his Miranda rights against self-incrimination, and
then placed inside a police cruiser, the judge said.</TE>
<TE>   Trooper Louis Santiago drove him to the police lockup at the
airport and along the way attempted to strike up a conversation, the
judge said.</TE>
<TE>   The trooper asked Reid his name, and Reid "replied that his name
could be taken from his passport."</TE>
<TE>   The trooper asked Reid where he was from, "to which Reid stated
'Europe,' " the judge said.</TE>
<TE>   The judge added: "At some point while in the cruiser, Trooper
Santiago also asked Reid, 'What happened on the plane?' which Reid
answered by stating that nothing happened on the plane.</TE>
<TE>   "Reid then asked Trooper Santiago, 'Where are the reporters?'
Trooper Santiago answered that there were no reporters because this
was 'not going to be a big deal.' "</TE>
<TE>   Reid continued to ask about the news media, the judge said, and he
"eventually became indignant" and stated, " 'You'll see. This will be
a big deal.' "</TE>
<TE>   At that point, the judge noted, Reid said: "I have nothing else to
say."</TE>
<TE>   An hour later, at the police lockup, Reid was again given a
Miranda warning, the judge said. There he rested and was provided
water.</TE>
<TE>   Reid had earlier been forcibly medicated on the plane to calm him
down, and emergency medical technicians at the police lockup noticed
that his blood pressure was elevated and his pulse low. Medical
technicians suggested he be hospitalized, but agents proceeded to try
to interview Reid further.</TE>
<TE>   At 5 p.m. that day, Reid was again read his Miranda protections
and spoke with investigators for 2 1/2 hours.</TE>
<TE>   "Reid answered many questions but declined to answer several
others," the judge said.</TE>
<TE>   The next day, he was again read a Miranda warning and again agreed
to talk with authorities.</TE>
<TE>   Each time, the judge ruled, Reid was not forced to cooperate. "The
police scrupulously honored Reid's right to cut off questioning," the
judge said.</TE>
<TE>   Defense attorneys in Boston could not be reached for comment.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors have said that Reid, in his conversations with the
FBI, said he wanted to blow up the flight because he was angry over
the U.S. war in Afghanistan.</TE>

<HD>Transportation Security Chief Quits Amid Turmoil</HD>
<DH>Terrorism: Congress and airlines had complained TSA was not
up to task. Deputy is nominated.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICARDO ALONSO-ZALDIVAR</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>After only seven months on the job, the head of the Transportation
Security Administration resigned under pressure Thursday amid
widespread concerns about the huge new federal law enforcement
agency, said administration and congressional officials.</LD>
<LD>   No reason was publicly given for the departure of John W. Magaw, a
career Secret Service executive with a distinguished record.</LD>
<LD>   However, members of Congress, the airlines and airport
organizations have been complaining that the TSA seemed overwhelmed
by the challenge of taking over aviation security and was isolating
itself from its key constituencies. Transportation Secretary Norman
Y. Mineta asked for and received Magaw's resignation, officials said.</LD>
<TE>   The new TSA nominee is James M. Loy, who retired May 30 as Coast
Guard commandant and has the transportation background that Magaw, a
law enforcement professional, lacked.</TE>
<TE>   Loy, 59, recently had been named Magaw's deputy and the TSA's
chief operating officer. At the time, department officials insisted
that Loy's appointment did not signal a loss of confidence in Magaw.
Barely six weeks later, it all changed.</TE>
<TE>   "Mr. Magaw's resignation is not surprising," said Sen. Patty
Murray (D-Wash.), who chairs the appropriations subcommittee that
controls the agency's budget. "The TSA has experienced setbacks in
trying to secure the nation's air transportation system."</TE>
<TE>   Other lawmakers seemed reluctant to criticize Magaw, 66, after his
resignation. Rep. Harold Rogers (R-Ky.), Murray's counterpart in the
House, previously had clashed with Magaw concerning agency spending.
But Thursday, Rogers complimented him.</TE>
<TE>   "I applaud John Magaw's faithful and diligent service to our
country," Rogers said. "His efforts have helped to restore confidence
in the traveling public and have strengthened the security of the
nation's transportation system."</TE>
<TE>   In an official statement, Mineta praised both men. "John Magaw is
a dedicated public servant with a lifetime of achievements in the law
enforcement field, and we all owe him a debt of service for his role
in the start-up phase of TSA," he said. "Adm. Loy has amply
demonstrated his ability to motivate and manage a large federal
agency when he was commandant of the Coast Guard. Jim Loy is the
right man for this job, at the right time."</TE>
<TE>   "The president very much appreciates the job that John Magaw did,"
White House Press Secretary Ari Fleischer told reporters traveling
with President Bush on Air Force One, "taking an agency that had no
structure, no formation, no form to it, and making great strides and
progress on behalf of the country and the traveling public at the
Transportation Security Administration."</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles Mayor James K. Hahn, who heads a national task force
on airport security, said Magaw had been responsive to cities. "He
was a very strong ally of mayors across America. I hope the new head
of TSA will be just as accessible and responsive."</TE>
<TE>   Created to prevent another terrorist attack on aviation, the TSA
still is virtually unknown by most Americans. That will quickly
change as the agency assumes control of security at 429 airports.</TE>
<TE>   But the agency is struggling, as Congress has set what are widely
viewed as unrealistic deadlines for deployment. By Nov. 19, the TSA
must take over all passenger security checkpoints, and by Dec. 31 it
must install technology to screen all checked luggage--1 billion bags
a year--for explosives. Its annual budget has ballooned from an
estimated $4 billion to more than $6.6 billion, and estimates of its
screener work force exceed 60,000.</TE>
<TE>   The TSA is charged with improving security in all forms of
transportation, including ports, rail, trucking, mass transit and
pipelines.</TE>
<TE>   Although aviation has consumed most of the agency's energies, the
TSA and Magaw alienated the industry, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   John Meenan, a senior vice president of the Air Transport Assn.,
an industry trade group, said Magaw dismissed the ATA's attempts to
help.</TE>
<TE>   In an interview, Meenan said: "We met with him shortly after his
appointment and we said, 'Look, you are being asked to impose a
security regime over what is probably the most complex business
enterprise in the world. You need a culture within TSA that puts
equal value on people with law enforcement backgrounds and those with
an understanding of how the air transportation system works.'</TE>
<TE>   "That view was pretty much flat-out rejected: They built an
exclusively law enforcement organization where the culture is not
inviting to people from any other environment."</TE>
<TE>   Magaw began his law enforcement career as an Ohio state trooper in
1959, rising to become Secret Service director. He often compared his
TSA job to building a car while it is traveling at 65 mph. At the
TSA, he was skeptical of a "trusted traveler" program supported by
the airline industry, and he ruled against providing pilots with
firearms in cockpits.</TE>
<TE>   Loy, who retired as a four-star admiral, was in the Coast Guard 38
years. He is credited with modernizing the service as its mission
expanded beyond search and rescue. In a recent interview, Mineta said
Loy would bring needed managerial and people skills to the TSA.</TE>
<TE>   Senate Commerce Committee Chairman Ernest F. Hollings (D-S.C.),
whose panel will hold confirmation hearings on Loy's nomination,
called him "an outstanding individual" who is "well suited to head
the agency." Now part of the Transportation Department, the TSA is
expected to form the largest unit of the proposed Department of
Homeland Security.</TE>

<HD>Republican Leadership Mulls Strategy on Scandal</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARK Z. BARABAK and MICHAEL FINNEGAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>SAN FRANCISCO</DL>
<LD>Republican leaders from across the country gathered Thursday in this
famously foggy city and immediately faced a cloud of a different
sort: the corporate corruption scandal that has come to swallow the
political scene.</LD>
<LD>   They called for a crackdown on executive excesses. They pointed
fingers, attacking Democrats for pointing fingers. They defended
President Bush and accused former President Clinton of turning the
'90s boom into a bacchanal.</LD>
<LD>   But mostly, party officials shrugged and shook their heads and
acknowledged that, like the weather, no one can accurately forecast
how today's climate will affect November's election.</LD>
<TE>   "If the economy remains solid, if the stock market reasonably
rebounds and gives faith to some folks, then I don't think there'll
be any significant impact," said Al Cardenas, chairman of the Florida
Republican Party. "If that doesn't happen ... "</TE>
<TE>   The three-day national strategy session came as the two major
political parties grapple for control of the nearly evenly divided
Congress and fight hand-to-hand in 36 governor's races across the
country, including in California.</TE>
<TE>   For a time, it seemed as if the war against terrorism and fallout
from Sept. 11 would dominate the midterm election. But lately, voters
have grown more concerned about the economy, with job creation in a
rut, and increasingly absorbed in the crises of confidence afflicting
institutions ranging from Major League Baseball to the Roman Catholic
Church to Wall Street.</TE>
<TE>   The shifting landscape "creates unease," said Tom Rath, New
Hampshire's longtime representative on the Republican National
Committee. "When you have a very popular president, any externality
that distracts from the focus on him and what he stands for we have
to worry about."</TE>
<TE>   The revelations of corporate misconduct are a particular concern,
several of those attending the strategy meeting said, given some
voters' preconceptions about the Republican Party.</TE>
<TE>   "I think we probably have more exposure because the public tends
to equate us more with big business," said Mike Hellon, a national
committee member from Arizona. "On the other hand, the wrongdoing,
the misconduct, started when Clinton was in office."</TE>
<TE>   Other partisans also suggested the roots of today's revelations
were planted firmly in the eight years that Democrats held the
political high ground. "They spent the whole time talking about how
the economy was the best it had ever been," said Mike McDaniel, who
was chairman of the Indiana Republican Party for the better part of
the Clinton administration. "But there was more corporate greed
taking place during those years than any time in history."</TE>
<TE>   To help set things right, a few here suggested it would be nice to
see some corporate heads roll. "People need to go to jail and people
need to know that we're as serious about crime in the boardroom as
crime in the streets," Hellon said.</TE>
<TE>   And yet while Republican lawmakers in Congress have been quick to
outflank the president, embracing tougher steps against corporate
wrongdoers than he proposed, the party's foot soldiers here had
nothing but praise for Bush. If anything, several warned against
taking the remedial steps too far. "This is the perfect recipe for
creating laws with unintended consequences that will hurt even more
down the road," said John Ryder, a GOP committeeman from Tennessee.</TE>
<TE>   Still, others see Congress as moving too slowly. They accused
Democrats of stalling progress on reform measures in hopes of keeping
corporate corruption alive as an issue until voters start making up
their minds in the fall.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a party that will screech if you politicize the war,"
Mindy Tucker, spokeswoman for the Republican National Committee, said
of the Democrats. "But it's fine with someone losing their entire
life savings" in a corporate collapse.</TE>
<TE>   What is needed, said Cardenas of the Florida GOP, is a balanced
and bipartisan approach, "not to grandstand as the Democrats are
doing."</TE>
<TE>   With the stock market sagging and the economy imperiled, restoring
faith in corporate America is "too serious a matter" to inject into
partisan politics, he added. But only up to a point.</TE>
<TE>   "At some point," Cardenas said, "if Democrats keep this up, we're
going to start pointing fingers."</TE>

<HD>State Can't Limit Scholarships</HD>
<DH>Court: Pursuit of a 'pastoral ministries' degree must be
allowed, despite ban on using public funds for religious instruction.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HENRY WEINSTEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A Washington college student who wants to use a state-funded
scholarship to study "pastoral ministries" must be allowed to do so
despite a state ban on using government funds for religious
instruction, the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals ruled Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   The 2-1 decision comes less than a month after a different 9th
Circuit panel drew vociferous criticism nationally by ruling in
another case involving church and state that the U.S. Constitution
forbids the words "under God" from being used in public school
recitations of the Pledge of Allegiance.</LD>
<LD>   Thursday's ruling that a state cannot prevent a person from using
educational funds to study for the ministry, appears to have
important implications for the nationwide debate over school
vouchers, legal experts said.</LD>
<TE>   Opponents of giving tax funds to parents who want to send children
to private religious schools lost a major case in the U.S. Supreme
Court last month, when the justices said that such vouchers do not
violate the Constitution. But opponents have argued that they could
fight vouchers using provisions in many state constitutions that
specifically forbid giving tax funds to religious schools.</TE>
<TE>   Thursday's ruling implies that those state constitutional
provisions might be vulnerable, said USC constitutional law professor
Erwin Chemerinsky, who called the decision "extraordinary."</TE>
<TE>   "This opinion says that, if government provides aid for secular
instruction, it has to provide it for religious instruction,"
Chemerinsky said.</TE>
<TE>   The recent Supreme Court decision found that vouchers were
permissible, he said, but "this is the first case I know of where a
court has said that a government is required to subsidize religious
instruction."</TE>
<TE>   The central figure in Thursday's case is Joshua Davey, who
qualified for one of the Promise Scholarships the state of Washington
established in 1999 for students from low- and moderate-income
families who graduate in the top 10% of their high school classes.</TE>
<TE>   Davey enrolled at Northwest College, located in a Seattle
suburb--a school affiliated with the Assembly of God denomination. He
signed up for a double major in business management and pastoral
ministries.</TE>
<TE>   But the law governing the scholarship prohibits eligibility for
any student "pursuing a degree in theology."</TE>
<TE>   Davey dropped the scholarship rather than change his major. But he
also sued in federal court in Seattle, alleging that state officials
had violated his constitutional right to the free exercise of
religion.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. District Judge Barbara J. Rothstein threw out the suit,
agreeing with state officials that they had acted properly.</TE>
<TE>   The Washington attorney general's office cited the statutory
language of the scholarship program and a provision of the state
Constitution, adopted in 1889, mandating that "no public money ...
shall be appropriated to any religious worship, exercise or
instruction, or the support of any religious establishment."</TE>
<TE>   Thursday's 9th Circuit ruling rejected that argument and
overturned Rothstein's decision.</TE>
<TE>   The state's decision to deny Davey the scholarship solely because
he decided "to pursue a degree in theology from a religious
perspective infringes his right to the free exercise of his
religion," wrote Appeals Court Judge Pamela Ann Rymer, an appointee
of former President Bush. Judge Ronald M. Gould, a President Clinton
appointee, joined Rymer's opinion.</TE>
<TE>   The state policy barring scholarships for theology degrees is not
neutral toward religion, even though the scholarship program itself
is neutral, Rymer said.</TE>
<TE>   Because the Washington scholarship program "discriminates on the
basis of religion," the state must offer a "compelling reason" to
justify it, Rymer wrote. "Washington's interest in avoiding conflict
with its own constitutional" ban on giving money to religious schools
does not meet that test, she concluded.</TE>
<TE>   But dissenting Judge M. Margaret McKeown, also a Clinton
appointee, said that Washington had "successfully navigated the
tensions between the free exercise of religion and the prohibition of
its endorsement when, at the time of statehood, it decided to refrain
from funding religious instruction."</TE>
<TE>   "Washington has neither prohibited nor impaired Davey's free
exercise of his religion," McKeown wrote. "He is free to believe and
practice his religion without restriction." The only action the state
has taken was to decline to pay for it.</TE>
<TE>   Because Davey "was still able to pursue his chosen major in the
absence of funding, he would be hard-pressed to argue" that the
state's action had the effect of "suppressing his religious
exercise," she said.</TE>
<TE>   The ruling is "the flip side of the pledge case," said Jesse
Choper, a constitutional law professor at UC Berkeley's Boalt Hall
School of Law, who had predicted in a legal article two years ago
that Supreme Court decisions would lead to a result of this sort.</TE>
<TE>   The fact that two panels of 9th Circuit judges had issued
diverging rulings in religious freedom cases within the same month is
not surprising, he said, because of the tension that has long existed
between the constitutional provision that protects the "free
exercise" of religion and the one that forbids the "establishment" of
religion.</TE>
<TE>   The Supreme Court decisions in this area "carry conflicting
implications," Choper said. "It is worse than muddy."</TE>
<TE>   Davey was represented by Stuart J. Roth of the American Center for
Law and Justice, a conservative public interest group. Roth said he
was pleased, but not surprised, at the outcome. Earlier Supreme Court
rulings "demanded this result," Roth said.</TE>
<TE>   Washington state Assistant Atty. Gen. Michael J. Shinn said he
disagreed with the ruling, but he said his office had not decided if
it will seek a rehearing from a larger panel of 9th Circuit judges.</TE>

<HD>GOP Is Against INS' Role in Security Plan</HD>
<DH>Terrorism: Rep. Armey proposes to split the agency's
functions. Senate may not agree.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NICK ANDERSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Top House Republicans endorsed much of President Bush's government
reorganization plan Thursday, but they rejected his proposal to move
the troubled federal immigration service intact to a new domestic
security department.</LD>
<LD>   Under legislation drafted by House Majority Leader Dick Armey
(R-Texas), the responsibilities of the Immigration and Naturalization
Service, now part of the Justice Department, would be divided. Border
security functions would move to a new Department of Homeland
Security, while immigration processing would remain at Justice.</LD>
<LD>   Armey's proposal for the INS rejects the advice of Atty. Gen. John
Ashcroft and instead follows the recommendation of the House
Judiciary Committee. The Bush administration had sought to move the
entire INS to the new Cabinet department, arguing that border
enforcement and immigration services were closely intertwined.</LD>
<TE>   The Armey bill is to be considered today by a special nine-member
panel of Republican and Democratic leaders. The panel, chaired by the
majority leader, will then forward legislation to the House floor for
debate and a vote, scheduled for next week.</TE>
<TE>   Though Armey's endorsement of dividing the INS functions between
two Cabinet departments is likely to carry great weight in the House,
the proposal will meet resistance in the Senate.</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.) and other senior lawmakers in
that chamber want to keep the immigration service intact as a
distinct unit within Homeland Security. The Senate is expected to
consider its own security bill after the House acts.</TE>
<TE>   Gordon Johndroe, a White House spokesman for homeland security,
said: ''We are pleased that Congress continues to move quickly on
enacting the president's proposal.'' He added that the White House
would continue to work with lawmakers on specifics of the plan.</TE>
<TE>   On several other key questions, Armey largely followed Bush's
blueprint.</TE>
<TE>   Like the president, Armey seeks to move the Coast Guard, the
Secret Service and the Federal Emergency Management Agency into the
proposed Department of Homeland Security.</TE>
<TE>   Those portions of the majority leader's bill reject
recommendations made by some usually influential lawmakers from both
parties. For instance, the House Transportation and Infrastructure
Committee last week voted to keep the Coast Guard in the
Transportation Department and leave FEMA independent.</TE>
<TE>   The 75-member committee, the largest in Congress, contended that
shifting the two agencies to a new department could give short shrift
to some of their missions that have little to do with domestic
security. The committee, which currently oversees both the Coast
Guard and FEMA, also was acting in part to protect its turf.</TE>
<TE>   Armey supported Bush on several management proposals as well,
trimming--but not killing--the president's requests for enhanced
executive authority in the department. For instance, Armey said the
new department should be given discretionary power for two years over
2% of the money Congress appropriates for homeland security programs.
Bush had sought an indefinite discretionary authority of 5%.</TE>
<TE>   With slight modifications, Armey also agreed with a Bush proposal
to exempt from public view information about homeland security
voluntarily supplied to the department by private businesses. And he
said that the administration should be allowed to appoint up to eight
assistant secretaries in the new department without the usual
requirement of Senate confirmation; the administration had sought
approval for up to 10.</TE>
<TE>   However, Armey's bill would strengthen privacy guarantees in ways
the administration had not sought. It would ban national
identification cards, even though Bush this week announced a proposal
to set national standards for licensing motorists. It would also
prohibit "Operation TIPS," a federal initiative that Armey said
''could be construed to promote citizens spying on one another.''</TE>
<TE>   On the immigration question, Armey is likely to face opposition
from several interest groups, the White House and Senate
Democrats--even if he manages to win House approval.</TE>
<TE>   Angela Kelley, deputy director of the National Immigration Forum,
a Washington-based organization that supports immigrants,
asylum-seekers and refugees, said splitting the INS between two
Cabinet departments was ''a recipe for disaster.''</TE>
<TE>   But lawmakers said that homeland security reorganization should
not slow immigration reform.</TE>

tag, House and Senate negotiators finally reached agreement Thursday
on a $28.9-billion emergency spending bill to help pay for military
operations in Afghanistan and other anti-terrorism initiatives.</LD>
<LD>   The bill is expected to clear Congress and be sent to President
Bush for his signature early next week, averting dire predictions of
funding shortfalls at the Defense Department and the Transportation
Security Administration.</LD>
<LD>   The compromise measure represents a big concession to the White
House, which had threatened to veto earlier versions of the bill that
would have cost more.</LD>
<TE>   The long and often bitter effort to keep a check on spending
pitted Office of Management and Budget Director Mitchell E. Daniels
Jr. not just against Democrats but also against powerful members of
Bush's own party.</TE>
<TE>   The retreat by lawmakers on the bill's cost may strengthen the
administration's hand as Congress begins earnest work on the year's
13 regular appropriation bills, which have shown signs of spiraling
beyond Bush's spending guidelines. Indeed, conservatives this week
tied up House proceedings for two days to protest spending bills that
they said would bust the budget.</TE>
<TE>   The jockeying highlights the cross-pressures on Bush as he faces
growing federal budget deficits. On one side, conservatives who are
crucial to Bush's political base argue that fiscal restraint remains
their party's stock in trade. But other Republicans are pushing the
bounds of Bush's budget request to improve GOP election prospects. In
their view, budget discipline has been loosened by the economic
downturn and the demands of national security.</TE>
<TE>   The emergency spending bill was this year's first test of Bush's
ability to balance those conflicting forces. The compromise, drafted
to resolve differences between House and Senate versions, includes
$14.4 billion for the Pentagon, $6.7 billion for homeland security
and $5.5 billion to help New York recover from the Sept. 11 terrorist
attacks.</TE>
<TE>   It also includes funding for an array of other needs, including
$100 million to help respond to recent floods and forest fires. The
bill funnels $200 million in aid to Israel and $50 million for
humanitarian aid to Palestinians.</TE>
<TE>   To help beef up federal oversight of business at a scandal-ridden
time, the bill includes $31 million for the Securities and Exchange
Commission. To help shore up the nation's ailing passenger railway,
the bill appropriates $205 million for Amtrak. And $400 million is
provided to help states overhaul their voting systems.</TE>
<TE>   The bill enjoyed broad bipartisan support, but its progress
through Congress proved remarkably contentious. Bush's initial
request was for $27.1 billion for defense and homeland security
expenses, costs stemming from the nation's response to the Sept. 11
attacks. The House passed a $28.8-billion version; although that
exceeded Bush's request, the administration endorsed it. But the
administration protested when the Senate version ran the bill up to
$31.4 billion.</TE>
<TE>   Members of the powerful House and Senate Appropriations Committee
labored for weeks to resolve their differences and last week
announced agreement on a $30.4-billion compromise. But Daniels
pronounced that unacceptable and threatened a presidential veto of
any bill over $28.8 billion.</TE>
<TE>   That sent appropriators of both parties into an unusually
personal, bitter rage against Daniels. They were particularly
infuriated that the administration was picking a fight over what they
saw as a relatively small amount of money, especially when the White
House put up almost no fight against a farm aid bill that grew to
$170 billion earlier this year.</TE>
<TE>   The delay in approving supplemental funds was starting to cause
problems. The Pentagon warned it was close to running out of money
for crucial functions. The Transportation Security Administration
said the delay jeopardized efforts to beef up passenger and baggage
screening at airports.</TE>
<TE>   Against that backdrop, congressional negotiators retreated and
agreed to a $28.9-billion compromise. Daniels welcomed the change of
heart and said the episode should teach Congress to take Bush
seriously when he draws a line on future spending bills.</TE>
<TE>   ''This president is very plain-spoken,'' said Daniels. ''When he
says a limit is a limit, he doesn't mean here's my opening bid.''</TE>
<TE>   Still, some conservatives are worried about whether Bush will have
the political courage to veto popular spending bills if they make it
to his desk in amounts exceeding his requests.</TE>
<TE>   Fiscal conservatives are especially concerned that spending will
spin out of control because partisan divisions have kept Congress,
for only the second time in a generation, from passing a budget
imposing an overall cap on spending.</TE>
<TE>   That's why conservative House Republicans this week protested an
Interior Department bill that totaled $19.8 billion, which exceeded
Bush's request by $777 million. They offered a series of amendments
to trim the cost of the bill.</TE>
<TE>   But the episode underscored how hard it is to curb spending: All
their amendments were overwhelmingly rejected. The bill passed and is
pending in the Senate.</TE>
<TE>   ''Fiscally responsible lawmakers are becoming an endangered
species,'' said Aileen Roder, an analyst for Taxpayers for Common
Sense, a budget watchdog group. ''Only a presidential veto can stop
these big spenders.''</TE>

<HD>Anti-Terror Bill on Tips Hits Skids</HD>

<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Newsday</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>A controversial government program that would encourage citizens to
report suspicious behavior that could be linked to terrorism would be
prohibited under legislation headed for approval by a House panel
today.</LD>
<LD>   Critics spanning the spectrum from the American Civil Liberties
Union to the Libertarian Party to conservative Republicans have
denounced the proposal, suggesting it would divide Americans and
jeopardize privacy.</LD>
<LD>   The Select Committee on Homeland Security, headed by House
Majority Leader Dick Armey (R-Texas), proposed banning any operation
that would "promote citizens spying on one another ... and prohibit
programs such as Operation TIPS," the Bush administration's plan to
enlist average Americans, such as truckers and mail carriers, to be
on the lookout for potential terrorists. They would report their
concerns to the Justice Department using toll-free hotlines
throughout the country in a pilot program expected to launch in
August and attract 1 million volunteers.</LD>
<TE>   An Armey spokesman said, "There's a better way to involve the
community in homeland security."</TE>
<TE>   "Communities should be working together, not being suspicious of
each other," spokesman Richard Diamond said.</TE>
<TE>   There were signs this week that the administration was downplaying
the initiative in the wake of widespread media coverage. The Justice
Department, responsible for administering the program, for example,
changed its Web site, removing specifics about who was expected to
participate and when the effort was scheduled to begin.</TE>

<HD>Ethics Violations Trip Traficant</HD>
<DH>Congress: Colleagues are unamused by the Ohio Democrat's
antics as they recommend that he be expelled from the House.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MEGAN GARVEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>In the august, wood-paneled congressional hearing room stood Rep.
James A. Traficant Jr., clad in a bright white suit, his
gray-speckled hair combed high in a plume, tossing out one-liners
like a stand-up comedian playing a small-town crowd.</LD>
<LD>   He requested yet another bathroom break, for once refraining from
naming his exact gastrointestinal complaint--something he had shared
frequently during his four days with a committee investigating
alleged ethics violations.</LD>
<LD>   He called his home district of Youngstown, Ohio, "Mobtown, USA,"
but said: "I wouldn't want to live anywhere else, and it's as good as
any town you come from."</LD>
<TE>   He offered a hollow apology for repeated insults of committee
members and then lobbed one last shell at chairman Joel Hefley, a
Colorado Republican, sputtering, "You, you Coors drinker."</TE>
<TE>   But fellow House members holding Traficant's political fate in
their hands had the straight faces of an audience for whom the joke
had become stale.</TE>
<TE>   In the morning, a House Standards of Official Conduct Subcommittee
found the nine-term Democrat guilty on nine of 10 counts of ethics
violations stemming from his felony conviction on federal bribery and
corruption charges three months ago. And in the afternoon, the full
committee unanimously approved his expulsion.</TE>
<TE>   "It's been one of the most unpleasant experiences I could ever
recall having," said Rep. Steven C. LaTourette (R-Ohio), a committee
member and Traficant friend.</TE>
<TE>   The decision shocked no one, least of all Traficant. The
61-year-old lawmaker has proclaimed over and over since returning to
Capitol Hill this week--for the first time since his April 11
conviction in Cleveland--that he fully expected to become only the
second member of Congress to be expelled since the aftermath of the
Civil War.</TE>
<TE>   He is scheduled to be sentenced in the criminal case July 30, and
federal prosecutors have asked that he serve at least seven years for
such transgressions as taking kickbacks and making congressional
staffers on government time shovel horse manure on his farm.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm here and I sure as hell am not resigning," said a defiant
Traficant, who at the hearing, as at his criminal trial, chose to
defend himself despite his lack of a law degree. The committee
rejected Traficant's request that the House delay any decision until
after his appeals are exhausted.</TE>
<TE>   "I've had it. Don't push me around," he said during his final
30-minute attempt to get a stay of his political execution. "I'll go
to jail. I'll let members of Congress put me in jail. But I'm going
to tell you this: This isn't Jim Traficant talking now. This is a
United States citizen and you're the Congress of the United States
and you've allowed this to happen."</TE>
<TE>   Traficant's portrayal of himself as the victim of a government
vendetta and "trophy" for the FBI and the IRS failed to persuade.</TE>
<TE>   "The committee determined that nine counts were proved by clear
and convincing evidence and include repeated abuses of the public
trust. Each of these violations is of the most serious nature," said
Robert Walker, chief counsel for the oversight panel, whose case
against Traficant closely followed that of the federal prosecution.
"Taken together, these violations unequivocally call for only one
response from you: that the House expel Mr. Traficant."</TE>
<TE>   The full House now will have to vote on whether to accept the
committee's recommendation. Expulsion requires the approval of
two-thirds of the members. The vote is expected next week.</TE>
<TE>   Four members in the 213-year history of the House have been
expelled, the most recent being Pennsylvania Democrat Michael Myers
in 1980, who refused to resign after his conviction for taking bribes
in the FBI's Abscam investigation of corruption in Congress.</TE>
<TE>   As at his nine-week trial in Cleveland, where he sparred with the
judge, used profanity, dropped boxes on the floor and threatened
physical harm to the prosecutors, Traficant's antics this week on
Capitol Hill have given an air of frivolity to a serious proceeding.</TE>
<TE>   He failed to show up on time on the second day of testimony,
saying no one told him to be there, though instructions had been
clear.</TE>
<TE>   He said Playboy bunnies visited a decrepit boat he lived on when
he was in Washington, but then said not even his wife wanted to board
it because there was no working toilet. The names of "Sopranos"-like
characters that figured in his trial rolled out of his mouth during
his self-defense--Sugar, Bucci, Cafaro, Traficanti--impossible for
the uninitiated to track.</TE>
<TE>   It always had been an improbable political rise for the onetime
star quarterback from the University of Pittsburgh. His start in
national politics was born out of his triumphant self-defense in a
1983 trial on charges that, as the elected sheriff of Mahoning
County, Ohio, he had taken more than $160,000 in cash from organized
crime figures.</TE>
<TE>   Although seen on tape taking the money, a jury acquitted him,
believing his argument that he had been running his own undercover
sting. He later paid tax penalties after failing to produce the cash.</TE>
<TE>   In a twist perhaps unique to his home region, it was the
mob-ordered attempted murder of the newly elected Mahoning County
district attorney on Christmas Eve 1996 that led to the widespread
corruption probe that eventually snared Traficant.</TE>
<TE>   Waiting for the sanctions portion of the hearing, Traficant held
court with spectators. He said he ran for Congress only because he
was convinced that, if he ran for sheriff again, someone would try to
have him killed.</TE>
<TE>   "I figured I would offer fashion, cerebral intelligence at a
magnificent level and the ability to communicate for my district,"
Traficant said. "I just didn't fall in line, kiss the chairman's back
end and wait for something eight years down the line."</TE>
<TE>   He spent some of his last minutes before the committee asking
members to help out his constituents who have been hard hit by job
losses. In a nod to the unlikely success of his 10th run for office,
this time as an independent, Traficant also asked that they work with
whoever takes his place--despite earlier protestations that he would
become the first person elected to Congress from prison.</TE>

<HD>Army Secretary Defends Role at Enron</HD>
<DH>Senate: Democrats on Commerce Committee attack his
credibility about bookkeeping at the energy giant. Some call for his
resignation.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ESTHER SCHRADER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Senate Democrats, continuing their offensive against the Bush
administration's close ties to big business, grilled Army Secretary
Thomas E. White on Thursday on his role at Enron Corp., and some
called for his resignation.</LD>
<LD>   In sometimes hostile exchanges with White, lawmakers questioned
the credibility of his statements that he knew nothing of the shoddy
accounting practices and manipulation of California's energy market
that Enron is alleged to have engaged in while he was vice chairman
of a major Enron division.</LD>
<LD>   They also questioned why federal regulators have not expanded
their investigation of the Texas energy firm to include White, now
serving as the Army's top civilian.</LD>
<TE>   "This looks to me like a textbook case of an administration
insider getting kid glove treatment," Sen. Byron L. Dorgan (D-N.D.)
said.</TE>
<TE>   "There are a lot of regulators in this executive branch who
apparently came to government service hoping not to regulate."</TE>
<TE>   White's appearance before the Senate Commerce Committee came as an
administration stacked with former captains of industry is under
increasing scrutiny as amid a spate of corporate accounting scandals.
It was the first time White has been asked to testify on Capitol Hill
about the Enron affair.</TE>
<TE>   President Bush on Wednesday rebuffed calls for more details of his
own business practices as a Texas oil executive in the early 1990s
and said he expects Vice President Dick Cheney to be cleared by a
Securities and Exchange Commission investigation into the accounting
practices of Halliburton, the Texas energy firm Cheney once led.</TE>
<TE>   White has not been implicated in any wrongdoing, although former
Enron employees have alleged that the division he headed used
questionable accounting practices during his tenure to overstate
profits by hundreds of millions of dollars.</TE>
<TE>   White told the panel that the accounting practices in question
were standard in the industry at the time.</TE>
<TE>   In a letter to White released Thursday, Sen. Barbara Boxer
(D-Calif.) called on him to resign and said his testimony was
"deceptive, argumentative, and not helpful in any way to the
committee's quest for the truth."</TE>
<TE>   Boxer wrote that there is a likelihood that further inquiries into
White's role at Enron would distract from his duties as head of the
Army. "The cloud surrounding you ... has grown darker," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Boxer was not alone. Sens. Joseph I. Lieberman (D-Conn.), a
prominent critic of the administration concerning Enron matters, and
Harry Reid of Nevada, the second highest-ranking Democrat in the
Senate, said this week they would support calls for White's
resignation. But Reid added that he was unsure how many Democrats
shared that view.</TE>
<TE>   At one point rapping his pen on the witness table, White defended
the accounting practices of the Enron division and the propriety of
77 phone calls he made to Enron executives at the same time he was
selling shares in the company worth more than $12 million.</TE>
<TE>   "I am responsible for the portion of that company that I ran," he
said. "The deals that we put together, within the accounting
structure that was the standard in the industry, I stand behind."</TE>
<TE>   White was vice chairman of Enron Energy Services, which traded
power to large energy companies. Critics say the division engaged in
questionable electricity trading that helped drive up electricity
prices during the 2000-2001 California power crisis.</TE>
<TE>   The Justice Department began a criminal investigation of Enron in
January aimed at determining whether the company defrauded investors
by deliberately concealing crucial information about its finances.
California state investigators are looking at what role Enron played
in the costly California energy crisis.</TE>
<TE>   White told the panel he was unaware of transactions detailed in a
December 2000 Enron memo that spelled out strategies that critics say
were meant to improperly take advantage of California's power
shortages. He said his division worked independently of Enron's
wholesale unit, whose traders wrote a memo detailing schemes they
dubbed Death Star, Fat Boy and Get Shorty to profit from the
California energy crisis</TE>
<TE>   "I can categorically say that it was not ever in the interest of
[his division of Enron] to see wholesale energy prices escalate,"
White said. "We were not in the California power market for the sake
of buying and selling and swapping and trading and whatever else
electricity. We were there to serve retail customers."</TE>
<TE>   Dorgan said he found it hard to believe that White's division was
unaware of what other company divisions were doing in allegedly
attempting to manipulate electricity prices.</TE>
<TE>   "It's all part of the Enron Corp. You're all kissing cousins
here," Dorgan said.</TE>
<TE>   White said he is "appalled and outraged at the facts that have
come to light since I left Enron" and told senators he counts himself
among the stockholders who were duped by the company.</TE>
<TE>   White made about $50 million while at Enron, from salary and stock
sales, but would have made even more if he had sold some of his stock
earlier, before the company's slide into bankruptcy.</TE>
<TE>   He agreed to sell his Enron holdings in May 2001, when he was
named Army secretary, but missed a 90-day deadline to do so.</TE>
<TE>   Boxer suggested that it was ludicrous for White to compare himself
with small investors and employees of Enron who lost everything. "I
would ask you in the name of, I don't even know what to call
it--candor," she said, "not to do that."</TE>

<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>ATLANTA</DL>
<LD>The number of infants dying of whooping cough, once a major killer of
children in the United States, is rising despite record high
vaccination levels in the nation, federal health officials said
Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   Researchers at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
speculated that the worrying trend might be an indication that the
bacteria that causes whooping cough is becoming more common in the
nation.</LD>
<LD>   Whooping cough, also known as pertussis, is marked by spasms of
coughing followed by vomiting and a "whoop" as sufferers can finally
suck in air. It occurs in all age groups.</LD>
<TE>   In 2000, the latest year for which data were available, there were
7,867 reported cases and 17 fatalities, compared with 7,297 cases and

<HD>Genetic Fear Factor Discovery May Help Fight Mental Illness</HD>
<DH>Brain: Gene variation identified by NIH team is the first
found that plays part in human emotion.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>EMILY SINGER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Scientists have identified a specific gene variation that sparks
heightened activity in the brain's "fear center"--the first gene
identified to affect a function of the brain related to human
emotion, according to researchers at the National Institutes of
Health.</LD>
<LD>   The gene activates the amygdala, a portion of the brain that
controls its response to frightening situations, and has been weakly
linked to increased anxiety.</LD>
<LD>   David Weinberger, chief of the Clinical Brain Disorders Branch at
the NIH, said the research is a key step in understanding the complex
biological puzzle of human temperament.</LD>
<TE>   "Genes don't create personality, but they give you the building
blocks. This is one building block of personality," said Weinberger,
director of the study published today in the journal Science.</TE>
<TE>   Ahmad Hariri, lead author and a staff fellow at the NIH, is quick
to point out that they have not discovered the "anxiety gene." This
gene is part of a complex system for determining how people feel
fear, Weinberger said. "There are lots of factors in how people react
to fearful stimuli," he said. "One of those is genetic."</TE>
<TE>   The gene in question is part of the serotonin system, a brain
messaging chemical that has been implicated in mood. There is a
naturally occurring variation in the gene--a short form and a long
form. Those with a shortened version have less of a protein, called
the serotonin transporter, "that is like a vacuum sucking the
serotonin out of the synapses," Weinberger said.</TE>
<TE>   There have been previous studies showing that people with the
short form of the gene are more anxious, but the results are far from
conclusive, Weinberger said.</TE>
<TE>   Evaluating anxiety can be a very subjective process, he said. Add
that to the complexity of the genetic system involved, along with the
many environmental factors that contribute to anxiety, and it becomes
difficult to assess the effect of a specific gene.</TE>
<TE>   Weinberger and colleagues decided to look at a more direct measure
of the gene's effect--the activity of the amygdala.</TE>
<TE>   The amygdala is a small, almond-shaped section at the bottom of
the brain that "turns on and off when the environment is dangerous,"
Weinberger said.</TE>
<TE>   To spark activity in the amygdala, NIH researchers showed people
pictures of frightened faces--a standard method used to evoke the
brain's fear response.</TE>
<TE>   People instinctively feel afraid when they see a scared human
face, Weinberger said. Even infants show this reaction.</TE>
<TE>   The team used functional magnetic resonance imaging, or fMRI, to
see how actively the amygdala responded to frightened faces. They
found that people with the short form of the gene had a "hyperactive"
amygdala.</TE>
<TE>   "This inherited variation of the gene sets the volume control of
the amygdala a little higher," Weinberger said. "They're a little
louder in response to dangerous signals in the environment."</TE>
<TE>   Michael Davis, a professor of psychiatry at Emory University in
Atlanta who studies the amygdala's relationship to fear, said the
findings will help in understanding why some people tend to be more
anxious. The results are a "good lead" that genetic variation of the
serotonin system is involved in anxiety, Davis said.</TE>
<TE>   "The gene by itself is no guarantee" that someone will suffer from
anxiety or depression, Weinberger said. But it could be a factor that
contributes to susceptibility to anxiety.</TE>
<TE>   One of Weinberger and Hariri's goals is to understand what makes
some people more susceptible to mental illness.</TE>
<TE>   The gene under study is involved in the neural pathway targeted by
the antidepressant Prozac. People with the short form of the gene
respond better to Prozac. Weinberger and Hariri plan to look at how
Prozac affects the activity of the amygdala in these individuals.</TE>

<HD>Twins' Hunter Drills Indians With His Bat</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Torii Hunter again said he was sorry for throwing a ball at Danys
Baez.</LD>
<LD>   He didn't apologize for his home run.</LD>
<LD>   Hunter, who drilled Baez a night earlier after getting hit by a
pitch, hit a two-run homer and Luis Rivas drove in the go-ahead runs
in the seventh inning as the Minnesota Twins rallied Thursday for an
8-6 win over the Cleveland Indians at Cleveland.</LD>
<TE>   Before the game, Hunter told Twin Manager Ron Gardenhire that he
had some unfinished business with the Indians.</TE>
<TE>   "He said, 'I owe them,' " Gardenhire said. "I don't think it's a
vendetta. But I'm sure it felt pretty good for him to be running the
bases."</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Baez, said he didn't go over to the Minnesota clubhouse
after Wednesday's game to apologize to Hunter for hitting him.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not trying to be friends," Baez said. "I just wanted to say,
'I didn't mean to hit you.' "</TE>
<TE>   Asked if he went over to fight Hunter, Baez said, "I never said
that. I was mad."</TE>
<TE>   Hunter used his bat to get back at the Indians as the Twins erased
a 6-2 deficit and swept the two-game series.</TE>
<TE>   Rivas broke a 6-6 tie with a two-run single when the Twins rallied
against Ricardo Rincon (1-4) and posted their 28th come-from-behind
win this season.</TE>
<TE>   Minnesota's win, coupled with second-place Chicago's loss at
Kansas City, gives the Twins an 11-game lead in the American League
Central--their largest in a division since Sept. 24, 1969.</TE>
<TE>   Milton Bradley hit a grand slam and Ellis Burks homered for the
Indians.</TE>
<TE>   Seattle 5, Texas 3--Charles Gipson Jr., who started to give Ichiro
Suzuki a night off, put down a suicide squeeze bunt to bring home the
go-ahead run in the ninth as the Mariners rallied to win at
Arlington, Texas. The Mariners, who have won nine consecutive games
in Texas, scored two runs in the eighth on Bret Boone's two-run
single to tie it, 3-3. Shigetoshi Hasegawa (5-1) got the win,
pitching a perfect eighth, retiring the top of the Texas lineup.</TE>
<TE>   New York 6, Detroit 5--Shane Spencer hit a tiebreaking RBI double
in the eighth as the Yankees won at New York to post their 22nd
come-from-behind win. Alfonso Soriano hit a leadoff homer and Raul
Mondesi also hit a solo shot for the Yankees, who have won 11 of 15
and lead the Boston Red Sox by three games in the AL East. Jason
Giambi's sacrifice fly off Fernando Rodney (1-3) tied it, 5-5, in the
seventh.</TE>
<TE>   Boston 4, Tampa Bay 3--Rickey Henderson and Lou Merloni hit solo
home runs and Trot Nixon had a go-ahead single in the eighth inning
for the Red Sox at St. Petersburg, Fla. Tampa Bay, on its fourth
losing streak this year of five or more games, lost for the 13th time
in 14 games.</TE>
<TE>   Kansas City 5, Chicago 3--Michael Tucker capped a ninth-inning
rally with a two-run homer and the Royals won at Kansas City, Mo., to
stretch a winning streak to seven for the first time in seven years.
Kansas City trailed, 3-2, before Carlos Beltran homered leading off
the ninth against Mark Buehrle. Paul Byrd (13-6) retired the final 15
batters and tied Boston's Derek Lowe for the AL lead in wins.</TE>
<TE>   Toronto 5, Baltimore 4--Jose Cruz Jr. homered in a four-run third
inning and the Blue Jays held on at Toronto, winning for the sixth
time in seven games. Cruz's 15th homer, a two-run shot off Travis
Driskill (6-3), gave Toronto a 3-0 lead.</TE>

<HD>Zito Vetoes Angel Plans</HD>
<DH>Baseball: Anaheim's momentum is blunted in 2-0 loss to A's
left-hander.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BILL SHAIKIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>OAKLAND</DL>
<LD>If not for Barry Zito, this could have been an electrifying weekend
of anticipation at Edison Field. The Angels expect a sellout crowd
tonight, and they plan to distribute 70,000 red wavy sticks--the kind
that basketball fans wave to distract free-throw shooters--so that
their fans can use them to annoy the Seattle Mariners, and to have a
good time.</LD>
<LD>   The Angels sent Ramon Ortiz home Thursday afternoon, so he could
be rested and ready when he starts against the Mariners tonight. If
the Angels had won Thursday, the momentum would have been theirs, and
they need all the momentum they can get because they have lost 12
consecutive games to Seattle at Edison Field. They could have dreamed
about a weekend sweep, one that would have allowed them to share
first place in the American League West with Seattle.</LD>
<LD>   If not for Zito, that is. The Seattle series will be no less
important, and perhaps no less fun, but the Angels cannot climb to
first place this weekend, and they might fall into third. Zito and
two relievers combined on a six-hit shutout Thursday, giving the
Oakland Athletics a 2-0 victory and dropping the Angels four games
behind the Mariners.</LD>
<TE>   The Angels also fell into a second-place tie with Oakland. And,
without the momentum of a victory, they were left to discuss not only
their loss Thursday but their long home losing streak against
Seattle.</TE>
<TE>   "It's like guys who go up against Tiger Woods," outfielder Tim
Salmon said. "They think they have to be perfect, and that gives him
an advantage. We just have to go out and play our game."</TE>
<TE>   The Angels threw a scare into the A's in the ninth inning, with
Zito already icing his arm. Salmon and Garret Anderson started the
ninth with back-to-back singles against Oakland closer Billy Koch,
but Troy Glaus was robbed of an extra-base hit on a spectacular
leaping catch by right fielder Jermaine Dye and Shawn Wooten was
robbed of an extra-base hit on an even more spectacular diving catch
by center fielder Terrence Long. Koch struck out Adam Kennedy to end
the game.</TE>
<TE>   On a night when Angel starter Aaron Sele was very good, giving up
two runs in seven innings, Zito was magnificent.</TE>
<TE>   Nothing new, at least not lately. Zito faced the Angels twice in
April, losing one game and receiving no decision in the other, but
since then he has been as dominant for the A's as Jarrod Washburn has
been for the Angels. The Angels already knew about Zito's terrific
fastball and curve; he wowed them Thursday with a changeup too.</TE>
<TE>   "That's the pitch he's added since the last time we faced him,"
David Eckstein said, "that makes him dominant."</TE>
<TE>   Zito (13-3), tied for the league lead in victories, has lost once
since April 30. He pitched 7 1/3 innings Thursday and gave up four
hits, all singles.</TE>
<TE>   After Zito retired nine of the first 10 hitters, the Angels loaded
the bases with none out in the fourth inning. Glaus, who had struck
out three times in his first six at-bats in the series, made two outs
this time. He grounded back to Zito, who started a 1-2-3 double play.</TE>
<TE>   Wooten then popped up, ending the inning. Glaus and Wooten became
the first of 11 consecutive batters retired by Zito.</TE>
<TE>   Oakland infielder Randy Velarde, a former Angel, said he foresees
the Angels, A's and Mariners extending the three-team AL West race
deep into September. Velarde said the only factor he could see
stopping the Angels was the one that stopped them when he played in
Anaheim.</TE>
<TE>   "Those guys have always been decimated by injuries, four or five
guys at one time," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels return to Anaheim after an eight-game trip that
included four losses and three players put on the disabled list,
including closer Troy Percival and catcher Bengie Molina. Here come
the Mariners.</TE>

<HD>Tavares Comes to Stoneman's Defense</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Bill Shaikin</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>OAKLAND</DL>
<LD>In five months as general manager of the Montreal Expos, Omar Minaya
has made seven trades. In those five months, Bill Stoneman has made
no trades. In his three years as general manager of the Angels,
Stoneman has made nine.</LD>
<LD>   The Angels' need for help is more urgent after three relievers and
the starting catcher were put on the disabled list within the past
three weeks, but Stoneman has yet to make a deal, even for a middle
reliever.</LD>
<LD>   The executive who hired Stoneman, Tony Tavares, is now president
of the Expos. Although Minaya pulled off dynamic deals to add star
pitcher Bartolo Colon and outfielder Cliff Floyd without adding to
the Montreal payroll, Tavares said it is too simplistic to conclude
that Stoneman tends to be cautious and Minaya tends to be aggressive.</LD>
<TE>   "They're two totally different situations. For all intents and
purposes, we have no future," Tavares said. "You tend to be a little
more aggressive in those circumstances. That's a huge difference."</TE>
<TE>   The Expos, expected to be eliminated or relocated after the
season, traded three quality prospects for Colon and two more for
Floyd. Stoneman inherited a thin minor league system, and he is
unlikely to trade a package of top prospects in a one-shot chance to
win this season.</TE>
<TE>   "And Bill doesn't have complete and total authority to make every
trade," Tavares said. "He's got to go to ownership."</TE>
<TE>   Tavares pointed out that, three years after Disney's disastrous
$80-million investment in Mo Vaughn, Stoneman was able to persuade
company executives to approve a $24-million contract for another free
agent, Aaron Sele.</TE>
<TE>   "You could say, since Mo Vaughn didn't work out, that Disney would
never sign any more free agents. But they did, for significant
dollars," Tavares said. "I don't think Bill is afraid to make a
trade."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   More names from the Angels' trade target list, all closers:
Detroit's Juan Acevedo (2.76 ERA, $850,000 salary), Milwaukee's Mike
DeJean (3.45 ERA, $1.4 million) and Tampa Bay's Esteban Yan (4.66
ERA, $1.5 million).... Catcher Bengie Molina realizes he could not
have prevented his latest hamstring injury, but he expressed his
frustration Thursday: "It's ... embarrassing. I'm ... letting the
team down. I can't even pick up my head. I can't look anybody in the
face." Athletic trainer Ned Bergert said this hamstring injury was as
severe as the one that sidelined Molina for seven weeks last season,
but Molina said it did not feel as bad and he hoped he could return
in four weeks.... At 11-2, Jarrod Washburn has an .846 winning
percentage, tied with Pedro Martinez for the best in the American
League.</TE>

<HD>Winning Number</HD>
<DH>Hopkins comes from a small town, but he has become a big
star for the Avengers</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>VALERIE GUTIERREZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>They crowd into the small, smoky community center to play bingo every
Wednesday night. The players, about 70 women from the surrounding
communities, intently watch the announcer as he spins the bin,
reaches in and selects a ball.</LD>
<LD>   "B-12," he calls out.</LD>
<LD>   There's a scramble to check cards to see if anyone has won. No one
has. Greg Hopkins spins again, aware of the importance of his job.</LD>
<TE>   As a receiver/linebacker for the Arena Football League Avengers,
Hopkins has been described in many ways: the best and hardest-working
player in the league, "an underwear model" in reference to his
head-turning good looks, and a motivating team leader.</TE>
<TE>   But for the people of Nineveh, Pa., population 88, he's a local
hero, the hometown boy who made good.</TE>
<TE>   "I owe a lot to having grown up there," Hopkins said. "It's like
no other place."</TE>
<TE>   Drive too fast on the two-lane road heading toward Waynesburg and
you might miss it. After all, the town whose only business is the
Hopkins Family Store hardly looks like a bustling city.</TE>
<TE>   "You feel as if you've been transported to the '50s," said
long-time friend and arena league broadcaster Ari Wolfe. "Everyone
does literally know everyone's name."</TE>
<TE>   The biggest name these days is Hopkins. The town shut down last
weekend when 60 supporters made the 5 1/2drive to Indianapolis to
watch the leading candidate for the AFL Ironman of the Year--the
league's highest honor.</TE>
<TE>   If they gave iron man awards in Nineveh, Hopkins already would
have a mantel full.</TE>
<TE>   But there's not a lot of public recognition in a town so small.
And it's not the reason he supervised a group of convicts as they
constructed the town's community center, or the reason he helped
acquire several grants to upgrade it.</TE>
<TE>   "I just wanted to do something," Hopkins said. "I had a few ideas
in my head and they kept growing."</TE>
<TE>   In the off-season, he serves as one of three elected county
auditors, perhaps the highest civic position in a town without a
mayor or a sheriff.</TE>
<TE>   His efforts are the reason the Little League field looks so
modern, or residents can play basketball under lights, or the
community can play bingo in the renovated facility.</TE>
<TE>   "We just learn to help each other a little bit," said Hopkins'
mother, Dottie. "We celebrate birthdays, holidays together.
Everyone's real friendly."</TE>
<TE>   His older and younger brother left the small town and visit
occasionally, but Hopkins, 30, returns to his parents' house every
off-season.</TE>
<TE>   "Helps him catch his breath a little," his mother said.</TE>
<TE>   But there's no time spent sitting around. He tends to the family
cattle ranch and does the bookkeeping or scoops the hand-dipped ice
cream at the store that has been in the family since 1946. There's
always a split rail fence to build or some other chore to get done.
And, of course, there's bingo to supervise.</TE>
<TE>   He came up with the idea two years ago. He rounded up some
volunteers, set up the snack bar and put the word out to the
neighboring towns. The profits would help maintain the community
center and fire station. Throughout the season on Wednesday nights,
Hopkins calls the center to see how it's going.</TE>
<TE>   "He takes bingo very seriously," said former teammate Jake
Hoffart, who has visited Nineveh. "It's the biggest thing out there."</TE>
<TE>   Hopkins credits his close-knit family upbringing and small,
blue-collar town ethics of hard work and strong values for his
success.</TE>
<TE>   His father, Sam, a no-nonsense quiet type, worked in the electric
power plants as a boilermaker for 30 years. As a young boy, Hopkins
also saw the toughened hands of the local men who'd stop by the store
for coffee in the mornings before heading out to the steel mills.</TE>
<TE>   "That's real work, then they come home and take care of the
ranch," he said. "Playing sports was easy."</TE>
<TE>   Hopkins grew up playing football and wrestling and did well at
both. Several Division I schools offered him wrestling scholarships,
but he wanted to play football. After setting nine school records as
a receiver at Slippery Rock University, he had a disappointing tryout
with the Pittsburgh Steelers. At the urging of an agent, he tried
arena football and hasn't looked back.</TE>
<TE>   Over the last three years, he has been one of the top receivers in
the league and this off-season was the most sought-after free agent
after leaving Indiana. First-year Avenger Coach Ed Hodgkiss, who was
Indiana's offensive coordinator the last three seasons, said Hopkins
came to Los Angeles because he wanted to help turn around the team's
direction.</TE>
<TE>   Hopkins, who today will sign a two-year contract extension to stay
in Los Angeles, has made an impact as the Avengers (7-6) clinched a
playoff berth. They play Buffalo in their regular-season finale
Saturday at Staples Center.</TE>
<TE>   Before the start of every game, Hopkins will give the team a
speech followed by the same motivational statement about attitude.</TE>
<TE>   "Everyone looks up to him," Avenger quarterback Tony Graziani
said. "Some guys just talk about commitment and character, Greg lives
his life that way."</TE>
<TE>   Hopkins almost sounds too good to be true.</TE>
<TE>   "Yes, people are always a little amazed by him," former teammate
Mike Pawlawski said. "But he's the real thing. You can count on Greg
to always do the right thing. It's genuine."</TE>
<TE>   Hodgkiss kids that he'll probably lose Hopkins to Hollywood before
retirement. But there's not a lot of glitzy swagger to him.</TE>
<TE>   "He would be happy driving a four-wheeler chasing cattle," Hoffart
said.</TE>

<HD>Baseball Clashes With Its Umpires in Court</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Baseball wound up in federal court again, suing umpires Thursday in
an attempt to discipline union head John Hirschbeck.</LD>
<LD>   In an eight-page complaint filed in U.S. District Court in
Manhattan, the commissioner's office said Hirschbeck told a member of
his umpiring crew not to warn a pitcher for intentionally throwing at
a batter. Management asked for a declaratory judgment that its
attempt to discipline Hirschbeck was not subject to arbitration.</LD>
<LD>   The commissioner's office also asked for a permanent injunction
preventing the union from taking the dispute to arbitration. The case
was assigned to U.S. District Judge Allen G. Schwartz.</LD>
<TE>   Larry Gibson, a lawyer for the umpires' union, countered that his
side never attempted to arbitrate over discipline to Hirschbeck, who
has headed the umpires in bargaining for the last two years. Instead,
he said the suit really was about management's reliance on a
computerized evaluation system the union claims is inaccurate.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Tampa Bay Devil Rays, said to be having cash-flow problems
earlier this year, were more than two weeks late before making nearly
$1 million in deferred payments to Steve Trachsel and Gerald
Williams, several baseball officials said.</TE>
<TE>   Trachsel, now pitching for the New York Mets, was due $428,571.43
on June 30 under a contract he signed with Tampa Bay two years ago.
But the Devil Rays did not direct deposit that amount until
Wednesday, according to four management and player sources, who all
spoke on the condition they not be identified.</TE>
<TE>   Devil Ray owner Vince Naimoli denied there had been any problem
with the payments. All 30 major league teams made their payrolls on
Monday.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Frank Robinson said he was quitting as Montreal Expo manager
earlier this week, angry with his players, then changed his mind.
Robinson tried to resign after Tuesday's 6-3 loss to Philadelphia,
then was talked out of it by the players. His attempted resignation
was confirmed by a top major league team official who spoke on the
condition he not be identified. Robinson denied trying to resign.</TE>

<KH>GOLF THOMAS BONK</KH>
<HD>Honourable Duffy Has a 67</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>THOMAS BONK</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>GULLANE, Scotland</DL>
<LD>Duffy Waldorf stood out in the crowd Thursday at Muirfield, and not
only because his 67 equaled the best round of the day. No, there's
much more to Waldorf than meets the eye, which is a load anyway.</LD>
<LD>   The guy tied for the lead at the British Open wears shirts that
look like he dipped them in a can of paint.</LD>
<LD>   The guy tied for the lead at the British Open uses golf balls with
names of his favorite custard flavors written on them.</LD>
<TE>   This same player tied for the lead at the British Open wears a cap
with "Duffy" embroidered in the front, perhaps so he will know that
it belongs to him. As if someone else would wear a blue and white
flowered cap.</TE>
<TE>   It's only Duffy, the 39-year-old in his 13th year as a pro, a UCLA
guy who has won four times on the PGA Tour, but is known much more
for his personality than his performances in the British Open.</TE>
<TE>   This is Waldorf's fifth trip and he's still trying to improve on
his tie for 25th in his first, in 1992, right here at Muirfield.</TE>
<TE>   But there he was Thursday afternoon, strolling in the sunshine,
rolling in everything in sight on the greens, taking the lead. All
the while, many thoughts must have floated into that space beneath
the blue and white cap.</TE>
<TE>   Stay out of the bunkers ... Keep the ball on the fairway ... Where
am I going to eat? ... Let's see, three more days, three clean shirts
left, I'm OK.</TE>
<TE>   Waldorf did not make a bogey. He parred the first eight holes,
then played the next 10 in four under. After that, he did three quick
television interviews, two more radio interviews, then went to the
media interview room for more conversation.</TE>
<TE>   If nothing else, Duffy is an accomplished talker, but you can be
sure that it's not so much what he's saying, but what he wears that
is steaming up a few monocles around here.</TE>
<TE>   The centuries-old Honourable Company of Edinburgh Golfers is the
club that runs Muirfield and, like Duffy, they're easy to spot,
although in an entirely different way.</TE>
<TE>   They are the gentlemen in the blue blazers, the blue shirts, the
red ties and wearing the round, red buttons that signify their status
as HCEG members.</TE>
<TE>   They are stuffy, he is Duffy.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, in his Hawaiian-style gear, Duffy looks like the guy
who sets up your lounge chair at the hotel pool and brings you a
towel.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, looks aren't everything. Just don't mention it to the
officials in charge here.</TE>
<TE>   Some people thought that it might have been the Royal and Ancient
Golf Club's worst nightmare when John Daly won their championship at
storied St. Andrews in 1995.</TE>
<TE>   The feeling was that they would have had to sweat it out like
crazy to see if Daly would grab the Claret Jug, fill it with
jellybeans or something, then announce he would defend his title only
if they moved the tournament to Arkansas.</TE>
<TE>   At least Daly wears clothes that don't appear to need watering.
Waldorf's wardrobe is something else indeed. Imagine if he somehow
won Sunday. The Honourable Company would come rushing out of the
ancient clubhouse and throw their jackets over Duffy's shoulders,
before someone's retinas were burned by the intensity of his lava red
shirt.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, they would probably invite a woman to become a member
before they would ask him.</TE>
<TE>   Duffy is the anti-Honourable Company of Edinburgh Golfers, which
is a good thing.</TE>
<TE>   Maybe he could win them over by discussing his collection of fine
wine, which now numbers more than 2,000 bottles cellared in his home
in Santa Clarita. Maybe he could promise to tone down his colors to a
nice shade of beige. Maybe he could wear a coat sometime that had a
lapel and pockets.</TE>
<TE>   Maybe none of this matters at all, because it certainly doesn't
matter to Waldorf. It took him a while, but he says he has this golf
thing figured out. He knows where it fits in his life and that would
be as his job. It's not his family, it's not driving his kids Tyler,
Shea, Kelli Ann and Justin to school in Northridge. It's not the
charity work he does.</TE>
<TE>   He was the college player of the year as a senior at UCLA and he
said he realized his lofty career ambitions were wrong as soon as he
played his first tournament. Duffy got a grip on reality early,
workwise.</TE>
<TE>   Even so, it's hard to say that anything's wrong with a career that
has produced not only the four victories but more than $7.2 million
in prize money.</TE>
<TE>   We just don't know what he's spending it on, besides wine, of
course. We do know one thing. It's not on clothes.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>If you believe sports has little to offer the average fan, you're not
alone, writes Greg Cote of the Miami Herald:</LD>
<LD>   "Somehow, over time, sports got away from us. The great American
hero machine is broken down, on the road to (you might even say)
perdition. Peruse the latest 'sports' news and struggle to find much
about actual playing. Struggle to find the fun in the games.</LD>
<LD>   "You see, all across sports, athletes gone bad, galloping ticket
prices, stagnant or declining attendance, southward TV ratings and
palpably rising fan disenchantment in the dried well of tax money for
new stadiums."</LD>
<TE>   More Cote: "Meanwhile, you see television shows celebrate the
garish excesses of an athlete's 'crib,' cameras fawning over what
should be seen literally as an embarrassment of riches.</TE>
<TE>   "You see, in a current national magazine, that NBA star Jalen Rose
pilots a customized $120,000 Cadillac Escalade with satellite TV, six
screens, multiple DVD changer, PlayStation2, rearview camera,
navigation system, VCR and 14 speakers. And you wonder why the
athlete-fan gulf ever widens?"</TE>
<TE>   Trivia time: Who are the three golfers who have won consecutive
British Opens since 1960?</TE>
<TE>   Speak up, Tiger: Jay Mariotti of the Chicago Sun-Times, joining
others in urging Tiger Woods to condemn the exclusionary policies at
all-male Muirfield and Augusta National:</TE>
<TE>   "His father, the Earl of Woods, desperately wants Tiger to have
the same social significance 'of Nelson Mandela.' So far, he's closer
to Charles Nelson Reilly."</TE>
<TE>   Casting call: Tom FitzGerald of the San Francisco Chronicle has
just the acting vehicle for feuding Giant teammates Barry Bonds and
Jeff Kent:</TE>
<TE>   "Director Wolfgang Petersen told Variety his upcoming
Batman/Superman film will portray the superheroes as allies who fall
out over 'differing philosophies.' Neither part has been cast.</TE>
<TE>   "Memo to Peterson: The Giants have a couple of sluggers who will
be available in the event of a work stoppage."</TE>
<TE>   Executive suite: From Steve Hummer of the Atlanta
Journal-Constitution: "According to a recent survey, 82% of corporate
executives cheat at golf. It can also be extrapolated that 18% cheat
on surveys."</TE>
<TE>   Mascot mania: The Phillie Phanatic's costume will be donated into
the National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum's permanent collection
July 27, joining those of the San Diego Chicken and Youppi, the
Montreal Expo mascot.</TE>
<TE>   Tough ticket: About 5,500 new seats will be ready this season for
season-ticket holders at Green Bay's renovated Lambeau Field,
increasing capacity to 71,000.</TE>
<TE>   That means the Packers' season-ticket waiting list dropped by
about 800, a team spokesman told the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel;
57,500 names remain on the list.</TE>
<TE>   Trivia answer: Arnold Palmer, Lee Trevino and Tom Watson.</TE>
<TE>   And finally: Nick Faldo says he has an agreement with the United
Golf Federation of Russia to open a golf academy, design an 18-hole
course and build a restaurant in Moscow.</TE>
<TE>   "There's only 27 holes in Moscow, and I've just won the contract
to put a new 18 holes there," he said. "I think golf has a great
future in Russia."</TE>

<HD>A Subpar Start for Woods</HD>
<DH>Golf: Favorite shoots a one-under 70, but that leaves him
three shots back of Waldorf, Toms and Pettersson on a mild day at
Muirfield.</DH>

<AU>MIKE JAMES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>GULLANE, Scotland</DL>
<LD>All week, players here have been saying they hoped to step forward if
Tiger Woods stepped back.</LD>
<LD>   Woods stepped back Thursday in the first round of the 131st
British Open at Muirfield, and 22 golfers sprinted ahead of him,
eager for the opportunity to create some positive space between
themselves and the world's No. 1 player.</LD>
<LD>   On a Southern California kind of day when fans replaced their
London Fogs with SPF-30 sunblock, Duffy Waldorf, David Toms and
Sweden's Carl Pettersson fired four-under-par 67s to take a one-shot
lead over a group of 12 players that includes Phil Mickelson, Justin
Rose and 45-year-old Nick Price and Sandy Lyle, 44.</LD>
<TE>   Two shots off the lead was another group of seven golfers, led by
Corey Pavin and Woods' buddy, 45-year-old Mark O'Meara, who birdied
three of the last four holes.</TE>
<TE>   Woods is in a group of 15 at 70 that includes 1999 Open champion
Paul Lawrie, Ernie Els, Brad Faxon, Lee Janzen and Tom Lehman.</TE>
<TE>   Add it all up and the leaderboard is more crowded than a free
Bruce Springsteen concert in Staples Center. Thirty-seven players are
under par, and a total of 86 players in the 156-player field are at
72 or better, within five shots of the lead.</TE>
<TE>   Players went at the course conservatively, most hitting their
drivers only three or four times during the round, planning to set
themselves up to hit the greens with mid-irons.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of guys are getting away to good starts but are playing
within themselves," Els said of the pressures accompanying the first
round of a major championship. "I think the guys are trying to just
keep it tight and not make any mistakes."</TE>
<TE>   Woods ran into trouble on his first swing and struggled all day
with his putting on the 7,034-yard links layout. He backed off his
tee shot on No. 1 when a photographer clicked his camera during
Woods' address. Woods hit into the deep rough, then backed off on his
second shot when photographers were jostling behind him.</TE>
<TE>   Woods chastised the photographer, muscled a wedge out of the rough
to the fairway and made an eight-foot par putt, about the only putt
he made all day despite hitting most fairways and greens in
regulation.</TE>
<TE>   "It was frustrating that I was hitting beautiful putts and they
were lipping out," said Woods, trying to become the only golfer other
than Ben Hogan in 1953 to win the first three legs of the Grand Slam.</TE>
<TE>   Woods needed 34 putts, but still, he is under par in the first
round of a major.</TE>
<TE>   "I got where I need to be," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Waldorf qualified for the Open only by virtue of his fifth-place
finish at the Western Open, then withdrew from the Greater Milwaukee
Open after one poor round last week because of a bad back. He played
without making serious mistakes or a bogey Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   "I wasn't hitting it solid," Waldorf said, "but I was hitting it
straight ... in the middle of the green."</TE>
<TE>   Waldorf, who earned his last PGA Tour victory when he shot past
Woods in the final round of the 2000 Disney, played conservatively
off the tees to avoid the deep bunkers and deeper rough.</TE>
<TE>   "If you'd seen me play the bunkers a couple of days ago, you'd try
finding the middle of the fairway too," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Toms, winner of last year's PGA, was happy to be back at a major
championship that rewards precision rather than distance, as the
Masters and U.S. Open did this year.</TE>
<TE>   "Those first two were not made for me at all," said Toms, who is
96th in driving distance on the PGA Tour. "But here, I can win on
this golf course."</TE>
<TE>   Pettersson, who turned pro in 2000 after an All-American career at
North Carolina State, would have had the outright lead had he not
bogeyed 18 in one of the final groups of the day.</TE>
<TE>   In the 2000 NCAA East Regional tournament, Pettersson beat the
field by four strokes but was disqualified for signing an incorrect
scorecard. He signed correctly Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   Shigeki Maruyama of Japan and Rose played in Woods' group, and
both outplayed him. Maruyama was the outright leader of the
tournament at four under after 12 holes but bogeyed 14 to fall back
to three under, where he finished.</TE>
<TE>   Rose also finished at 68, making two delicate sand saves at 15 and
16.</TE>
<TE>   "I was pretty nervous on the first tee, more nervous than I've
been all year," said Rose, 21. "But I nailed a two-iron down the
fairway, which settled the nerves pretty quickly."</TE>
<TE>   Rose turned pro at 17 after his surprising fourth-place finish in
the 1998 British Open at Royal Birkdale. He proceeded to miss 21
consecutive cuts on the PGA European Tour, but has won twice this
year.</TE>
<TE>   "I am one of the youngest," he said of players in the field. "I
feel a bit battle hardened, to be honest."</TE>
<TE>   Rose is also confident. He placed a legal wager with British
bookmakers that he would beat Woods on Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   "I made a couple of quid on the 18 holes today," he said. "I think
I got 5-to-2 odds."</TE>
<TE>   The rest of the group at 68 is former British Open and Masters
champion Sandy Lyle, 43; two-time U.S. Open winner Steve Jones, Len
Mattiace, Thomas Bjorn and Soren Hansen of Denmark, Stephen Ames of
Trinidad, 48-year-old Des Smyth of Ireland and Jean Francois Remesy
of France.</TE>
<TE>   Joining Pavin and O'Meara at 69 are Steve Stricker, Padraig
Harrington of Ireland, Ian Garbutt and Ian Poulter of England and
Taichi Teshima of Japan.</TE>
<TE>   The real British Open is expected to return today, with rain
expected. Increasing winds are predicted for the weekend.</TE>

<AU>MIKE JAMES and THOMAS BONK</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>GULLANE, Scotland</DL>
<LD>He's within a few months of qualifying for senior events, he has been
a fixture on the PGA European Tour since players were wearing plaid
Sansabelt bell-bottoms, and he's a stroke off the lead after the
first round of the 131st British Open at Muirfield.</LD>
<LD>   He's as unlikely a contender as was Rodney Pampling, who led the
1999 Open at Carnoustie, then failed to make the cut.</LD>
<LD>   Des Smyth is a 49-year-old Irishman who shot a three-under-par 68
Thursday, defying history and an unfortunate turn of events that
nearly kept him out of the tournament altogether.</LD>
<TE>   Smyth has played in 21 British Opens. He has made the cut only six
times, including last year when he finished tied for 13th at Royal
Lytham. He did become the oldest winner in European tour history last
year, at 48, but he has missed the cut in half of the 12 tournaments
he has played in this year.</TE>
<TE>   So there was no indication he was going to go out at Muirfield and
beat Tiger Woods by two shots.</TE>
<TE>   Particularly after Monday night. Smyth flew from Geneva to London,
then after reaching Edinburgh he drove the 20 miles to Muirfield. He
played nine holes, exhausted, then returned to his car for a nap
while he waited for a friend.</TE>
<TE>   "I put the seat down and laid in the car with one foot over the
steering wheel and one foot on the dashboard," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "I shouldn't have done that."</TE>
<TE>   He awoke 15 minutes later with a stiff back, had trouble sleeping
Monday night, played the next day despite increasing pain, then
sought medical help.</TE>
<TE>   He was told not to play Wednesday, so he didn't, taking
anti-inflammatory medication in the hope that he would recover by
Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   "My only worry was that I would have to pull out," he said. "That
would have broken my heart."</TE>
<TE>   Smyth slept well Wednesday night and even surprised himself in the
first round.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't think I'd play so well," he said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   No one is sure what got into Mark O'Meara, but the 45-year-old
1998 British Open champion who has missed eight cuts this year turned
in a two-under 69.</TE>
<TE>   O'Meara birdied four of the last six holes, including the 17th and
18th, to post his best first-round score in the British Open other
than his 67 in 1996 at Royal Lytham, where he wound up tied for 32nd.</TE>
<TE>   Woods says he isn't surprised O'Meara opened so well.</TE>
<TE>   "Mark was hitting the ball best I've seen it in practice rounds
... in a couple of years, just shot after shot. He had his shape
again. You can see he was starting to get his length back.</TE>
<TE>   "You can see the confidence building day after day."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   How long should it take to play a round at Muirfield? No more than
four hours 20 minutes, according to a Royal and Ancient document that
spells out the maximum time allowed on each hole.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Nick Faldo turned 45 Thursday, but instead of a birthday cake,
whisky maker the Famous Grouse presented him with a vintage malt. The
supplier of spirits also said that if Faldo wins, the first 300 fans
at the bar at the course will receive free whisky.</TE>
<TE>   Look for Faldo to pick up a few extra fans this week, but the
three-time British Open champion shot a 73.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Ian Woosnam is here, but his caddie of a year ago is not. Woosnam
was tied for the lead on the last day at Lytham but took a two-stroke
penalty when his caddie, Miles Byrne, told him there was one too many
clubs in his bag.</TE>
<TE>   Woosnam bogeyed two of the next three holes and was history, tying
for third.</TE>
<TE>   After he opened with a one-over 72, Woosnam was asked if his
caddie had counted the clubs.</TE>
<TE>   Said Woosnam: "Of course he did."</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Byrne is out of golf and works as a laborer at Dray, a
small town near Dublin.</TE>

<HD>Dodger Batters Bobble It</HD>
<DH>Baseball: L.A. gets five hits against Tomko and Hoffman and
falls to 1-7 after All-Star break with 4-1 loss.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GARY KLEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A sellout crowd of 53,662 filled Dodger Stadium on Thursday night to
collect Shawn Green bobblehead dolls and help the struggling Dodgers
out of their second-half stupor.</LD>
<LD>   But pregame cheers turned to boos and the fans were left shaking
their heads as the lowly San Diego Padres beat the Dodgers for the
second night in a row and the third consecutive time this season,
4-1.</LD>
<LD>   Brett Tomko gave up one run and five hits in eight innings and
Trevor Hoffman earned his 22nd save as the Padres extended the
Dodgers' losing streak to four games.</LD>
<TE>   The Dodgers, who surged to the top of the NL West standings in the
first half, are now 1-7 since the All-Star break. They have lost
eight of nine games and 10 of 13.</TE>
<TE>   "We definitely are probably pressing too much," Dodger second
baseman Mark Grudzielanek said.</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers have scored only 17 runs since the All-Star break and
have lost three series in a row.</TE>
<TE>   Manager Jim Tracy did the math for himself after the game and said
he is well aware of the anemic run production.</TE>
<TE>   "That's a pretty good idea where our major shortcoming has been
since we came back from the break," Tracy said.</TE>
<TE>   The only good news for the Dodgers was losses by Arizona and San
Francisco earlier in the day. The Giants come to town tonight for the
start of a three-game series.</TE>
<TE>   "You try to find something positive out of every situation, but
when you've lost like we've lost, it gets old and frustrating no
matter what," center fielder Dave Roberts said.</TE>
<TE>   Tracy juggled the lineup a bit, moving hot-hitting Paul Lo Duca to
the No. 3 spot and batting Shawn Green in the cleanup position for
the first time since May 8.</TE>
<TE>   Tomko and Hoffman negated the shuffle.</TE>
<TE>   Lo Duca, who had three of the Dodgers' four hits in Wednesday's
loss and 11 multihit games since June 25, was hitless in four
at-bats. Green was 0 for 3 with a walk.</TE>
<TE>   Mark Kotsay and Phil Nevin, former All-Americans at Cal State
Fullerton, hit solo home runs in the third and fourth innings
respectively for the Padres, who were 0-7-2 in their last nine
series.</TE>
<TE>   That was more than enough for Tomko (5-6), who gave up five hits a
night after Brian Lawrence pitched a five-hit shutout.</TE>
<TE>   "I had a good sinker," Tomko said. "I was just trying to locate it
and get ground balls. And I think, early on, their offense was
swinging at pitches early in the count."</TE>
<TE>   It was the second outstanding performance by Tomko against the
Dodgers this season. Tomko pitched seven scoreless innings and struck
out a career-high 13 in a 5-0 victory on April 21.</TE>
<TE>   Andy Ashby (7-8) was the loser in that game and he lost again
Thursday, giving up four runs and 10 hits in six-plus innings.</TE>
<TE>   Along with Kotsay's seventh homer and Nevin's seventh homer, Ashby
gave up a run-scoring single to Tomko in the seventh before he was
replaced by Jesse Orosco.</TE>
<TE>   Orosco surrendered an RBI single to Ryan Klesko to make the score
4-0.</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers scored their only run in the eighth inning when
Grudzielanek hit a one-out single, moved to third on Alex Cora's
pinch-hit single and scored on Roberts' ground ball to second baseman
Ramon Vasquez.</TE>
<TE>   Tomko then got pinch-hitter Dave Hansen on a called third strike
to end the threat.</TE>
<TE>   Hoffman pitched a scoreless ninth as the Padres won a series for
the first time since mid-June when they took two of three games from
the Seattle Mariners. The Padres have won three games in a row, a
feat they had not achieved since a winning four in a row May 12-15.</TE>
<TE>   Tracy and his players say they are ready for their series against
the Giants despite their troubles.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not do or die, but it's a big series," Tracy said.</TE>
<TE>   Roberts said the key for the Dodgers is obvious.</TE>
<TE>   "We just have to find a way to go out there and score some runs,"
he said.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The middle of the Dodger lineup has not produced since the All-Star
break and at least one observer with experience as a cleanup hitter
said it is no secret why.</LD>
<LD>   Steve Garvey sat in the Dodger dugout before Thursday night's game
between the Dodgers and the San Diego Padres and said the Dodgers'
run producers are not using the entire field.</LD>
<LD>   "Except for two guys, Lo Duca and Green, everyone is trying to
pull the ball too much," said Garvey, who produced 992 of his career
1,308 RBIs for the Dodgers from 1970-82. "When you're in a slump you
should do just the opposite and go the other way."</LD>
<TE>   The Dodgers' lack of production from the cleanup spot continued
Thursday night in a 4-1 loss.</TE>
<TE>   Shawn Green, who was moved from third to fourth in the batting
order to give hot-hitting Paul Lo Duca an opportunity to produce some
runs, went 0 for 3 with a walk.</TE>
<TE>   Dodger cleanup hitters are now one for 27 since the All-Star
break.</TE>
<TE>   Garvey, who lives in Utah, said he watches the Dodgers regularly
on satellite television. He said the Dodgers would come out of their
slump when players stop trying to win the game with one swing.</TE>
<TE>   "Tommy [Lasorda] would have us hit and running, he'd even have me
stealing," Garvey said. "It's those kinds of plays, not necessarily a
big hit, that can turn things around for a team."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   A sellout crowd of 53,662 was on hand on Shawn Green Bobblehead
Night.</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers also sold out their May 31 game against the Arizona
Diamondbacks when Lo Duca bobbleheads were given away.</TE>
<TE>   The final bobblehead promotion, which involves pitcher Hideo Nomo,
is Aug. 24 against the Atlanta Braves.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Center fielder Dave Roberts stole second base in the sixth inning,
giving him 23 steals this season. That's one more than Tom Goodwin's
team-leading total of last season.... Alex Cora had a pinch-hit
single in the eighth inning. He is 10 for 29 with a home run and
three runs batted in as a pinch-hitter this season.</TE>

<HD>Fehr Says Expo Lawsuit Could Hurt Negotiations</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JASON REID</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The head of the Major League Baseball Players Assn. suggested
Thursday the sport's labor talks could soon grind to a halt because
of Commissioner Bud Selig's legal battle over the future of the
Montreal Expos.</LD>
<LD>   Don Fehr, executive director of the union, cautioned about the
possible effects on negotiations of a civil lawsuit brought by former
minority partners of the Expos against Selig, Jeffrey Loria, owner of
the Florida Marlins and former managing partner of the Expos, and Bob
DuPuy, baseball's chief operating officer, accusing them of mail
fraud and wire fraud.</LD>
<LD>   The suit further delays Major League Baseball's plan to eliminate
or auction the only club it operates, creating another potential
distraction for owners with the sides resuming negotiations after a
week off.</LD>
<TE>   There was no movement on the core economic issues of revenue
sharing among the clubs or a luxury tax on teams with high payrolls
as collective bargaining resumed in New York, and Fehr worried that
the process could become even more bogged down because of the
situation in Montreal.</TE>
<TE>   "It doesn't directly relate to the negotiations, but the presence
of the suit has the capacity to complicate our bargaining
significantly," Fehr said at Dodger Stadium before the San Diego
Padres' 4-1 victory over the Dodgers. "Obviously, it's something that
you realize could be a factor."</TE>
<TE>   The group of former Expo minority owners, made up of prominent
Canadian companies, contends that Selig, Loria and other high-ranking
baseball officials conspired to eliminate baseball in Montreal and
reduce the companies' holdings--from 76% to about 7%--in the club
that baseball's 29 other teams combined to purchase from Loria for
$120 million. The companies, which now own 6% of the Marlins, want
the Expos to be placed in a trust and plan to seek an injunction if
baseball tries to move or fold the team.</TE>
<TE>   Although arbitrator Shyam Das is scheduled to announce his ruling
on the union's contraction grievance on Aug. 1, the effects of the
ruling, regardless of which side Das favors, cannot be negotiated
until the Montreal matter is resolved. And having Selig and DuPuy,
the owners' lead negotiator, distracted by a lawsuit seemingly might
not be conducive to pushing the process forward.</TE>
<TE>   "This suit involves people that don't have anything to do with us,
but there are issues that could [impact] us indirectly," Fehr said.
"It certainly doesn't make my job, getting an agreement for the
players, any easier."</TE>
<TE>   Talks had not been sailing along before the suit.</TE>
<TE>   The union agreed to one worldwide draft in the last full
negotiating session, but it would be limited to 16 rounds under their
proposal and 38 rounds under the owners' plan, so the sides are still
far apart on that issue.</TE>
<TE>   Negotiations also have lagged on the major financial issues.</TE>
<TE>   The high-revenue clubs transferred $167 million to the
lower-revenue clubs last year, and the owners are now seeking to
transfer about $298 million from the high-revenue teams in their
proposal. The union is at $228 million.</TE>
<TE>   The sides differ on the method of distribution, but an agreement
on numbers might lead to an agreement on method. So a compromise
would seem possible on that front, though other ancillary financial
issues would have to be addressed beforehand.</TE>
<TE>   "If you get rid of the other issues, which potentially relate to
player salaries, then it could change," Fehr said. "Once we don't
have to be concerned with those issues, then the revenue sharing
issue becomes easier to deal with."</TE>
<TE>   Fehr plans to complete his tour of all 30 clubs, updating players
on the status of negotiations, by the end of the month, returning to
New York to take part in talks and possibly set a strike date. It is
uncertain whether the union is considering an August or September
strike date.</TE>

<KH>SHANE MOSLEY vs. VERNON FORREST WBC WELTERWEIGHT CHAMPIONSHIP</KH>
<HD>Head Games</HD>
<DH>Before the first punch is thrown, the accusations fly</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE SPRINGER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>INDIANAPOLIS</DL>
<LD>Did you hear about the new school of hard knocks, Head Butt U?
Evander Holyfield is the dean, Vernon Forrest is the star pupil and
graduating students don't throw their caps in the air, but instead
fling them off by whipping their heads forward in a violent motion.</LD>
<LD>   Just another head butt joke, folks. You hear them all over this
city this week and from both corners of Saturday night's World Boxing
Council welterweight title fight between Forrest, the champion, and
challenger Shane Mosley at Conseco Fieldhouse.</LD>
<LD>   It is the topic of conversation surrounding this fight. Not
whether Mosley's speed can nullify Forrest's punching power. Not
whether Mosley made a mistake in taking this rematch immediately
after Forrest's victory over him in January. Not whether Forrest's
style gives him the advantage.</LD>
<TE>   Those subjects, once hot-button topics, have paled in comparison
to the overriding question: Was the second-round head butt in the
first fight accidental, or a planned tactic by Forrest? Mosley was
clearly the more stunned of the two fighters after they banged heads,
suffering, he later learned, a concussion.</TE>
<TE>   Forrest went on to knock Mosley down twice in that round and win a
unanimous decision against Mosley, who had entered the ring 38-0 with
35 knockouts.</TE>
<TE>   In recent weeks, Mosley has accused Forrest of deliberately
jamming his head forward to inflict damage. Mosley claims one of his
sparring partners, believed to be former Forrest sparring partner
Leroy Brooks, told him that a former unidentified trainer of
Holyfield taught fighters during secret sessions how to use the head
butt as a weapon. And, insists Mosley, Forrest was one of those
students.</TE>
<TE>   Jack Mosley, Shane's father and trainer, has gone so far as to
accuse Forrest of putting nylon in the corn rows of his hair to make
the head butts even more dangerous.</TE>
<TE>   The professors at Head Butt U are obviously creative.</TE>
<TE>   Thursday, it was Forrest's turn to lash back.</TE>
<TE>   The Georgia native, who will putting his unblemished record (34-0,
26 knockouts) on the line Saturday, appeared uptight Wednesday. When
the sound was shut off on a profanity-laced recording he was using as
background for his public workout at Conseco Fieldhouse, an angry
Forrest stormed out without talking to the media.</TE>
<TE>   But Thursday, before a workout at a local gym, he was relaxed and
happy to talk about Mosley and that infamous head butt.</TE>
<TE>   "Shane says he had a concussion from that head butt?" Forrest
said. "I think it was worse. I think he had brain damage. He's
delusional. It's insane to even comment about this. I think he might
need a neurologist. He might not be fit to fight mentally. The whole
thing is comical. I get great pleasure out of hearing this stuff. It
makes my day. I guess he has to fabricate things to give him
self-confidence.</TE>
<TE>   "What purpose would I have [in deliberately initiating a head
butt]? My whole goal was to become champion by beating him. Why would
I possibly risk everything?"</TE>
<TE>   Especially since it had already happened to him once before.</TE>
<TE>   Although Forrest has been fighting professionally since 1992 and
had held various lesser titles, he finally got a chance at an
International Boxing Federation crown in August 2000 when he faced
Raul Frank for the welterweight championship.</TE>
<TE>   The match ended in the third round because of--you guessed it--a
head butt. The butt was ruled accidental and the match was ruled no
contest. Forrest had to wait nine months to get another shot at Frank
and the IBF title. Finally, in May of last year, the two met again
and Forrest finally got a major championship by winning a decision.</TE>
<TE>   "The first thought that came to my mind," Forrest said of the
Mosley head butt, "was, oh man, another Raul Frank situation where
the fight ended with a controversy. I didn't want that to happen."</TE>
<TE>   So what did happen?</TE>
<TE>   "When I fight," Forrest said, "I am in a zone. He is in a zone.
When those two zones clash, things happen."</TE>
<TE>   Things happened to Forrest as well. He says he suffered a broken
eardrum in the collision of heads, but hasn't made a big deal out of
it.</TE>
<TE>   "It was like, if you take a running start and then run into a
brick wall," Forrest said. "That's how it felt to me. It felt like I
got hit in the head with a sledgehammer."</TE>
<TE>   Forrest's determination to continue was fueled by a decade of
frustration. He beat Mosley when the two were amateurs en route to an
amateur record of 225-16. Forrest won an Olympic berth for the 1992
Games in Barcelona but lost his first match, after, he said, coming
down with food poisoning the day before. For 10 years, Forrest
struggled for recognition while Mosley went on to the IBF lightweight
title, the WBC welterweight crown and a prominent spot at or near the
top of most lists of the best pound-for-pound fighters in the world.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, in January, Forrest had the opportunity to catch up to
Mosley.</TE>
<TE>   In the days leading up to that fight, and in the days after it as
well, there were good feelings exhibited and mutual respect displayed
between the Mosley and Forrest camps.</TE>
<TE>   But, for the 31-year-old Forrest at least, all that is over.</TE>
<TE>   "My perception of him," Forrest said, "has gone down the drain."</TE>
<TE>   Leaving Mosley the butt of joke after joke.</TE>

<HD>Sky Jack, Came Home Might Head East</HD>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The big winners Sunday at Hollywood Park--Sky Jack in the Hollywood
Gold Cup and Came Home in the Swaps--might run their next races
outside California.</LD>
<LD>   Sky Jack, a 6-year-old gelding who has run only 14 times, all at
California tracks, is not likely to surface at Del Mar, trainer Doug
O'Neill said. The San Diego Handicap, on Aug. 4, fits Sky Jack as far
as the 1 1/16-mile distance, but O'Neill doesn't relish facing Mizzen
Mast, who's expected to run.</LD>
<LD>   Del Mar's richest race, the $1-million Pacific Classic on Aug. 25,
is 1 1/4 miles, which might be too far for Sky Jack even though it's
the same distance as the Gold Cup. Sky Jack barely held on Sunday to
defeat Momentum by a nose. Another consideration for O'Neill is that
his wife, Linette, is expected to deliver their first child around
the same time as the Classic.</LD>
<TE>   A race under consideration is the $500,000 Woodward, at 1 1/8
miles, at Belmont Park on Sept. 7. O'Neill is more certain about Sky
Jack's long-range goal, the 1 1/8-mile California Cup Classic at
Santa Anita in October. In 2000, Sky Jack won the Cal Cup race, his
first stakes victory in his ninth start.</TE>
<TE>   Sky Jack is not eligible for the $4-million Breeders' Cup Classic,
to be run at Arlington Park on Oct. 26, and it would cost his owners,
Rene and Margie Lambert, $360,000 to supplement him. "We'd be crazy
to do that," O'Neill said. The Classic is a 1 1/4-mile race.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike Sky Jack, Came Home has run outside California, though not
well the last two times. He was sixth in this year's Kentucky Derby,
and seventh in the Breeders' Cup Juvenile at Belmont Park in 2001.
Before that, he won the Hopeful at Saratoga. Came Home is undefeated
in California--the Swaps was his fourth in a row at Hollywood Park
and his Santa Anita Derby win, in April, was his third in a row
there.</TE>
<TE>   "We'll have to take a look at the Haskell," Came Home's co-owner,
John Toffan, said after the Swaps. The Haskell Handicap, a $1-million
race at Monmouth Park on Aug. 4, is at 1 1/8 miles, the same distance
as the Santa Anita Derby and the Swaps. But War Emblem, who beat Came
Home by more than 10 lengths in the Kentucky Derby, is headed for the
Haskell.</TE>
<TE>   Free House, the last Swaps winner raced by Toffan and his partner,
Trudy McCaffery, traveled to New Jersey three weeks later in 1997 and
finished third, behind Touch Gold and Anet, in the Haskell.</TE>
<TE>   "Whatever we do, we're going to have to go east," Toffan said. Del
Mar's series for 3-year-olds, which concludes with the Del Mar Derby
on Sept. 7, is on grass, a surface Came Home has never tried. The
earliest Saratoga races for 3-year-olds are the $500,000 Jim Dandy,
the same day as the Haskell, and the $1-million Travers on Aug. 24.
Paco Gonzalez, who trains Came Home, mentioned Saratoga's $200,000
King's Bishop, the same day as the Travers, but that would require
moving the colt back from nine to seven furlongs.</TE>
<TE>   None of the Eastern races for 3-year-olds is expected to have a
large field. Saturday's $300,000 Ohio Derby has only five horses.
Some of the best horses in the division will not be immediate
factors: the injured Sarava, the Belmont winner, is out for the year,
as is Proud Citizen, who recently had leg surgery. Buddha, who's had
a series of problems since winning the Wood Memorial, and Harlan's
Holiday won't return until the fall. Monmouth Park lists only six
possibles for the Haskell, one of them Came Home. Of the others, the
top challengers for War Emblem are Medaglia d'Oro and Sunday Break.</TE>

<LD>Before she switched to the turf, Smokin' Charlotte hadn't done much
to distinguish herself.</LD>
<LD>   The chestnut daughter of Red Bishop had only one win in her first
eight races, the victory coming against a weak field of
California-bred maidens on Dec. 22, 2000, at Hollywood Park.</LD>
<LD>   After running fourth and sixth on the dirt in her first two races
after being moved to the barn of John Sadler, Smokin' Charlotte tried
the grass for the first time Dec. 30.</LD>
<TE>   Turf did not look like it was going to be the answer. She finished
fifth that day, beaten by nearly six lengths at 26-1.</TE>
<TE>   In four races since, she has two wins and a nose loss. She was
sixth in her other grass outing on March 31 but was beaten by only
two lengths after a very troubled trip.</TE>
<TE>   Owned by a partnership that includes her breeders (Fast Lane
Farms), Smokin' Charlotte became a stakes winner for the first time
when she won the Fran's Valentine on April 28 at Hollywood Park and
she'll be favored to add another stakes win in tonight's $75,000
Valkyr.</TE>
<TE>   Restricted to California-bred fillies and mares, the Valkyr is one
mile and Smokin' Charlotte will win if she duplicates her last race.
She was held back early by jockey Victor Espinoza, who has the mount
tonight, then took over early in the stretch and went on to win by 3
1/2 lengths.</TE>
<TE>   The field for the Valkyr is completed by comebackers Mind For
Gold, who has been away since Sept. 27; Castling, who was last seen
finishing third on the Santa Anita main track on Feb. 6, longshot
Meteor Game and recent turf winners Proud Tammie and
Exclusiveandcatty.</TE>
<TE>   Race of the day: Bella Bellucci, proclaimed by some the best
3-year-old filly in the land even though she has failed in both of
her Grade I appearances, makes her first start since her flop in the
Acorn on June 7 in today's eighth at Belmont Park. The French Deputy
filly will be ridden by Jerry Bailey in the 1 1/8-mile allowance
race.</TE>
<TE>   Who's hot: Alex Solis. The jockey won four more races Wednesday at
Hollywood Park to continue his late-season surge. He is winning at
better than a 25% clip.</TE>
<TE>   Who's not: John Quiles. The New York-based trainer is 0 for 38 in
2002.</TE>
<TE>   Exotically speaking: A pick four using Spunky Gal, Re Vote and
Bully's Del Mar in the fifth, singling Unchain The Stars in the sixth
and Smokin' Charlotte in the seventh and using Chinois, Panther
Quick, Bet On Brad, Saxmeamemo, Stanleojackteddie and Star Of Stage
in the eighth.</TE>
<TE>   Winners: Previous day/meet total: 1/163. Money: Previous day/meet
total: $6.60/$923.40. Total money bet: $1,066.</TE>

<LD>Devean George stayed because being a Laker, after three championship
seasons, was habit forming.</LD>
<LD>   "One of the things I learned is being a part of a winning team and
the relationship with the guys is very important to me," he said
during a news conference Thursday in El Segundo, shortly after
signing his new contract. "I think I turned down some more money. I
wanted to be happy first."</LD>
<LD>   George will earn $13.5 million in the next three seasons. The
fourth year, at his option, is worth $4.95 million.</LD>
<TE>   The contract could be worth $18.45 million and not quite the
maximum allowed by the collective bargaining agreement, as suggested
Wednesday by agent Mark Bartelstein.</TE>
<TE>   Either way, George said, "I should have no problem living off this
one."</TE>
<TE>   The news conference ended a thrilling two weeks for George, who in
his third NBA season became a regular part of Phil Jackson's rotation
and a fairly regular contributor. The exposure was enough to make
George one of the flashier free agents in a weak field.</TE>

<TE>   Kobe Bryant played Thursday night in the Entertainers Basketball
Classic at Rucker Park, the well-known Harlem summer league venue in
New York that has played host to many of the game's legendary
playground and NBA players.</TE>
<TE>   On an outdoor court at 155th Street and 8th Avenue, surrounded by
a standing-room-only crowd that began to form early in the afternoon
for a game scheduled for 6 p.m., Bryant had 15 points, seven rebounds
and seven assists in barely more than a half for Murda Inc. Records.
The game was called early in the second half because of rain, though
Bryant, according to witnesses, already had dazzled the crowd with
soaring dunks and deft passes.</TE>
<TE>   Bryant's game was delayed an hour because the opposing team, which
included Toronto's Jerome Williams and Houston's Moochie Norris, was
late. Bryant spent the time shaking hands and signing autographs for
fans who screamed when he entered a court made famous by the likes of
Wilt Chamberlain and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar.</TE>
<TE>   Bryant, who earlier this week broke ties with Adidas, wore Nike
shoes. Also, he recently was spotted in a Los Angeles-area Nike
store, fueling speculation he eventually will sign with Nike.</TE>

<TE>   The Clippers signed point guard Marko Jaric, their second-round
pick from the 2000 draft, to a multiyear contract. Jaric, 6 feet 7
and 198 pounds, averaged 15.2 points, 4.9 rebounds and 2.6 assists
last season for Kinder Bologna, the Italian League champion.</TE>
<TE>   "We like Marko's size, competitiveness and style of play," Clipper
General Manager Elgin Baylor said.</TE>

<KH>MOTOR RACING SHAV GLICK</KH>
<HD>Gibbs Simply Keeps Making the Rounds</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SHAV GLICK</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Joe Gibbs was in town this week, promoting his book, "Racing to Win,"
attending the Christian Book Sellers Assn. conference and meeting
with sponsors.</LD>
<LD>   "Sometimes it seems that meeting and getting sponsors is the way I
spend most of my time, but that's what you have to do these days in
NASCAR," said the former Super Bowl-winning coach who became a NASCAR
team owner and won the Winston Cup championship in 2000.</LD>
<LD>   Gibbs' No. 18 Interstate Batteries car, driven by Bobby Labonte,
has 18 corporate sponsors; his No. 20 Home Depot car, driven by Tony
Stewart, has 10.</LD>
<TE>   "As an owner, my job is to get the right people together, get them
the right equipment and keep finding and satisfying sponsors. Without
sponsors, you couldn't exist in NASCAR, not if you wanted to win, or
even compete.</TE>
<TE>   "The sport has grown so quickly. When we formed our team in 1991,
we had 17 people. Today we have 200 overall. We have almost as many
engineers as we had people back then. We have six 18-wheelers for our
four drivers [Labonte and Stewart in Winston Cup, Mike McLaughlin in
Busch and his son, Coy Gibbs, in trucks] and we go to around 50 races
a year.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a logistical nightmare, coming and going. Like this week,
after the race Sunday in Chicago, we tested Monday and Tuesday in
Indianapolis and must be at Loudon [N.H.] to get ready for this
Sunday's race.</TE>
<TE>   "And it takes sponsors to keep it all flowing. That's my job, to
sell them on Joe Gibbs Racing and then keep them happy. On any Cup
weekend, I'll visit at least half a dozen sponsor groups with our
drivers, Bobby to some and Tony to some. That takes up most of Sunday
mornings before the guys have to get ready to race."</TE>
<TE>   The Indy test was the first time the team was able to compare
Pontiacs and Chevrolets. Gibbs announced last Sunday that his team
was leaving Pontiac and returning to Chevrolet.</TE>
<TE>   "We'll see how the tests go. If the Chevrolet is ready, we may run
them as soon as the Brickyard 400 [Aug. 4]. If not, for sure next
season."</TE>
<TE>   Why the change, after Labonte won the championship a year ago and
Stewart is third in points this season?</TE>
<TE>   "It's a matter of numbers. We want to know where we stand in
relation to other teams. Last year, after several Pontiac teams
joined Dodge, there were only a couple of us left. We feel that by
using Chevrolets we will get a better feedback on how we compare with
other top teams like Hendrick [Jeff Gordon, Jimmie Johnson, Terry
Labonte], Childress [Kevin Harvick, Robby Gordon] and Earnhardt [Dale
Jr., Michael Waltrip, Steve Park]."</TE>
<TE>   The subtitle of Gibbs' book, "Establish Your Game Plan for
Success," is the essence of the book, written with Ken Abraham. In
its 287 pages ($21.99, Multnomah Publishers, 2002), it contains the
keys Gibbs used to climb from a hot-rodding teenager in Santa Fe
Springs to the heights of America's two most popular sports,
professional football and NASCAR stock car racing.</TE>
<TE>   Most of it with a heavy flavoring of God's help.</TE>
<TE>   Gibbs is a devout Christian who believes in telling his story and
if he ever decided to follow a third career, it could easily be as a
preacher in the manner of Billy Graham. The book is No. 6 on the
Christian best seller list.</TE>
<TE>   Biblical references and principles intermingle with tales of
locker room life as a football coach and the rough-and-tumble 200-mph
world of auto racing.</TE>
<TE>   "To be successful in football or racing, or in life, one needs a
good game plan," Gibbs said. "Life is not an exhibition game or a
dress rehearsal. This is the real deal, and following the game plan
is not optional. Here's the bottom line: There is a God, and He has
drawn up the perfect game plan for your life."</TE>
<TE>   Gibbs gives full credit to the Lord for his successes, as when he
writes, after Labonte won the Winston Cup crown, "The Lord gave us a
great year."</TE>
<TE>   Left unsaid was what kind of year the Lord gave Hut Stricklin or
Kyle Petty or any of the other 40-odd drivers who didn't win.</TE>
<TE>   The book, although full of stock car racing anecdotes, never
mentions that Gibbs fielded a powerful National Hot Rod Assn. drag
racing team from 1994 to 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Gibbs made the stunning move from Super Bowl to Winston Cup
because he felt it was a better place to keep his family together.
His sons, J.D. and Coy, are now integral parts of Joe Gibbs Racing,
J.D. as president of JGR and Coy as coordinator of memorabilia sales.</TE>
<TE>   Coy also drives in the Craftsman Truck series.</TE>
<TE>   "One always worries for his drivers, where they are on the track,
are they safe or did they get hurt in an accident, but when it's your
own flesh and blood, it's more than that. It's downright scary when
you've just watched Tony and Bobby going 188 [mph] at Daytona and
then see your own son going 189 in a truck on the same track. I
almost panicked."</TE>
<TE>   Coy Gibbs, who was a linebacker in football at Stanford, has two
third-place finishes this year and is 10th in the truck points.</TE>
<TE>   Gibbs says one of the questions he is most asked is which was more
difficult, winning three Super Bowls or the Winston Cup championship.</TE>
<TE>   "First, I reiterate that both are team sports," he said. "Then I
tell them it took me two years to win my first Super Bowl and nine
years to win my first Winston Cup."</TE>
<TE>   Gibbs also likes to compare the two, linking his drivers with his
football quarterbacks and his crew chiefs with himself as coach of
the Washington Redskins.</TE>
<TE>   Open Wheel Racing</TE>
<TE>   The sorry downward slide of CART continued this week when its
Sept. 21 race in Germany was canceled because of financial
difficulties. Not affected, apparently, was a Sept. 14 race in
England although the two races were supposed to share the cost of
bringing the teams to Europe. CART was already suffering from a lack
of teams, with only 18 drivers on its roster.</TE>
<TE>   This is the second year CART has lost races. Brazil and Texas were
canceled last year.</TE>
<TE>   Clip and save: The Indy Racing League will be at California
Speedway on Sept. 21 next year, a big change from this year's March
date. The CART date is not set yet but is expected to be in November
again. This year it will be Nov. 3.</TE>
<TE>   Eliseo Salazar, A. J. Foyt's veteran Chilean driver, will return
to IRL action Saturday night at Nashville Superspeedway after
recuperating from chest injuries suffered in a crash during practice
on April 16 at Indianapolis. He will drive a third car for Foyt,
joining Greg Ray and Airton Dare.</TE>
<TE>   Last Laps</TE>
<TE>   Stock car fans who like variety can take their pick Saturday
night--on the asphalt at Irwindale Speedway or on the dirt at Perris
Auto Speedway. Both will feature five classes of cars, with more than
100 vehicles expected at both tracks.</TE>
<TE>   For the first time in more than 80 years, Washington will be the
site of a major race when the Cadillac Grand Prix takes place this
weekend on a 1.7-mile seven-turn road racing course in the parking
lots of Robert F. Kennedy Stadium. Featured will be a Trans-Am race
on Saturday and an American Le Mans Series race Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   Dave Villwock won his fifth APBA Gold Cup for unlimited
hydroplanes last Sunday on the Detroit River. It was the 14th Gold
Cup for Bernie Little, owner of Miss Budweiser. The unlimiteds will
be in San Diego on Sept. 22.</TE>
<TE>   Passings</TE>
<TE>   Art Crawford, 74, of Rancho Cucamonga, who promoted races at
Culver City Speedway in the 1950s and more recently was press box
manager at Irwindale Speedway, died Tuesday of complications from a
stroke. Survivors include his wife, Connie, twin daughters Ashley and
Erin, age 8; and five adult children, Tom, Karen, Cindy, Kathy and
Kane from two previous marriages. Services will be at 10 a.m.
Saturday at Shepherd of the Hills Church in Rancho Cucamonga.</TE>
<TE>   Russ Clendenen, 94, a U.S. Auto Club racing official for more than
50 years, died Monday at a nursing home in Dayton, Ohio.</TE>

<DH>Basketball: L.A. to open ABC's coverage with Dec. 25 game
against the Kings at Staples Center.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>ABC, which has the NBA for the first time since the 1972-73 season,
will begin its coverage with a Christmas Day doubleheader featuring
the Lakers and Sacramento Kings in a 5:30 p.m. game at Staples
Center.</LD>
<LD>   The other ABC game has the Boston Celtics playing at the New
Jersey Nets at 3 p.m., according to the NBA schedule released
Thursday. Detroit visits Orlando at 11 a.m. in a game that ESPN will
televise that day.</LD>
<LD>   ABC will televise 14 regular-season games, with the Lakers
appearing a maximum of four times. Other teams making four
appearances on the network will be the Kings, Dallas Mavericks and
Philadelphia 76ers.</LD>
<TE>   ABC will have Philadelphia-Dallas on Jan. 4 (a Saturday), then
start regular weekly Sunday coverage Feb. 16.</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers begin their bid for a fourth consecutive NBA
championship Oct. 29, when they play host to the San Antonio Spurs.
That game will be part of the national doubleheader on TNT but will
be televised by Fox Sports Net in Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers will raise their championship banner and collect their
rings in a ceremony before the game against the Spurs.</TE>
<TE>   There will be 14 games on Oct. 30, and ESPN will televise a
doubleheader featuring Washington at Toronto followed by the Lakers
at Portland. The Laker game will also be televised by Channel 9.</TE>
<TE>   The NBA is returning to ESPN for the first time since the 1983-84
season as part of a new six-year television contract.</TE>
<TE>   ESPN will televise 68 games and ESPN2 will televise eight. The
ESPN schedule will generally consist of a Wednesday night game and a
Friday doubleheader.</TE>
<TE>   There will be no blackouts of ESPN telecasts.</TE>
<TE>   On Nov. 15, ESPN will televise Houston at Phoenix, which will mark
the first national telecast with top draft pick Yao Ming of the
Rockets. Two nights later, Ming and the Rockets will play the Lakers
at Staples Center.</TE>
<TE>   Turner Sports, which will be televising the NBA for a 19th
consecutive season, will air 52 regular-season games on TNT, with 48
of those as part of Thursday night doubleheaders. TNT will also
televise the All-Star game Feb. 9 at Atlanta.</TE>
<TE>   There are also expected to be four games a week on a new outlet,
probably NBA TV, which is available on satellite and digital cable.
AOL Time Warner, TNT's parent company, bought 11% interest in NBA TV
for $45 million.</TE>
<TE>   Channel 9 will continue to televise Laker road games not on ABC,
with Fox Sports Net televising the non-ABC home games.</TE>
<TE>   The Clippers, who were not on an over-the-air station last season,
will have 25 games televised on Channel 5.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Detroit Red Wing captain Steve Yzerman will have knee surgery in
early August and is expected to sit out the first two months of next
season. The 37-year-old center helped Detroit win the Stanley Cup
despite an injured right knee.</LD>
<LD>   He decided not to have reconstructive surgery and instead will
have a realignment next month in London, Ontario. He is not expected
to be able to play until January.</LD>
<LD>   Yzerman had 13 goals and 35 assists in only 52 games last season,
but he led the Red Wings with 17 assists and 23 points during the
playoffs. He has 658 goals and 1,004 assists in 19 NHL seasons, all
with Detroit.</LD>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Defenseman Robert Svehla ended his 35-day retirement and agreed to
a contract with the Toronto Maple Leafs, who acquired his rights in a
trade with Florida.</TE>
<TE>   The Panthers received restricted free agent defenseman Dmitry
Yushkevich, an All-Star in 2000. The 33-year-old Svehla agreed to a
one-year deal with options for two additional years.</TE>
<TE>   Svehla, who announced his retirement June 12 following a contract
dispute, has played his entire eight-year career with the Panthers.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Marc Bergevin rejoined the Pittsburgh Penguins on after spending
last season with St. Louis. The 36-year-old defenseman had three
assists in 30 games last season for the Blues after appearing in 36
games for Pittsburgh in 2000-01. He has played for seven teams in 18
NHL seasons.</TE>

<TE>   Australian Open champion Thomas Johansson of Sweden has pulled out
of next week's Mercedes-Benz Cup at UCLA because of an injured knee,
according to his management agency. Johansson, who won his first
Grand Slam title in January in Melbourne, has not won a tournament

<TE>   Gustavo Kuerten lost in the second round of the Mercedes Cup to
Germany's Lars Burgsmueller, 7-6 (5), 3-6, 7-6 (4), at Stuttgart,
Germany. Kuerten, seeded No. 2, had to play twice on Thursday, after
three days of rain at the start of the tournament forced organizers
to crowd 14 matches into one day.</TE>
<TE>   In the morning, Kuerten defeated Stefan Koubek, 6-3, 6-3, in a
match that had been postponed twice. Top-seeded Jiri Novak, a Czech
who was a semifinalist at the Australian Open, had to play only once
and eased into the quarterfinals with a 6-0, 6-2 victory over
Fernando Meligeni, another Brazilian.</TE>
<TE>   No. 3 Guillermo Canas of Argentina defeated Felix Mantilla of
Spain, 6-4, 6-3, and No. 4 Younes El Aynaoui of Morocco beat Johan
Settergren of Sweden, 6-4, 6-2. Mikhail Youzhny, a 20-year-old
Russian, defeated Hicham Arazi of Morocco, 6-2, 5-7, 6-4, then beat
sixth-seeded Nicolas Lapentti of Ecuador, 6-2, 6-4. Seventh-seeded

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Colorado Manager Clint Hurdle stayed with shortstop Juan Uribe
through seven hitless games and was finally rewarded.</LD>
<LD>   Uribe ended an 0-for-26 slide with a single and then broke a tie
with a two-out, two-run single in the seventh inning as the Rockies
beat the Arizona Diamondbacks, 6-4, Thursday at Denver.</LD>
<LD>   "Sometimes a pat on the back is a lot better than a slap on the
butt and there is only three feet difference," Hurdle said. "I know
he is going to play here for a long time so I have to pick my spots
when I go to the whip and when I encourage. I have been doing a lot
of encouraging lately."</LD>
<TE>   Larry Walker went three for three with a walk and two runs batted
in to improve his batting average to .349. Making his 100th career
start, John Thomson gave up four runs and seven hits in six innings,
and Justin Speier (4-0) pitched a perfect seventh for the win.</TE>
<TE>   With the score tied at 4-4, Walker led off the seventh inning with
a single off Greg Swindell (0-1), who was replaced by Mike Koplove.
Walker stole second and reached third on a ground ball. Todd
Hollandsworth was walked intentionally and stole second without a
throw.</TE>
<TE>   Uribe hit a flare to right just out of second baseman Junior
Spivey's reach to score Walker and Hollandsworth.</TE>
<TE>   "That was a relief," said Uribe, who raised both fists above his
head when he reached first base. "I was relieved to get a big hit and
to give our team a chance to win."</TE>
<TE>   St. Louis 5, San Francisco 1--Matt Morris gave up one run in eight
innings as the Cardinals won at St. Louis. Morris (11-6) ended a
two-game losing streak as he struck out eight and walked one. J.D.
Drew hit a two-out RBI double, and Mike DiFelice added a two-run
single off Jason Schmidt (5-4) as the Cardinals broke a 1-1 tie with
a three-run sixth. The Cardinals have won five of six and 10 of 14.</TE>
<TE>   Atlanta 3, Florida 1--Tom Glavine (12-5) won for the first time in
six starts as the Braves won at Atlanta to send the Marlins to their
eighth consecutive loss. Florida, the only winless team in the major
leagues since the All-Star break, hasn't won since trading slugger
Cliff Floyd and pitcher Ryan Dempster on July 11.</TE>
<TE>   Montreal 2, New York 1--Vladimir Guerrero hit his third homer in
two games, a go-ahead drive in the eighth inning that led the Expos
at Montreal, ending the Mets' four-game winning streak. Bartolo Colon
(3-0) gave up 13 hits in his second consecutive complete game and his
sixth of the season.</TE>
<TE>   Houston 4, Milwaukee 2--Jeff Bagwell hit a tiebreaking two-run
double off Jamey Wright (2-9) in the eighth to help the Astros win at
Milwaukee. After the Astros tied it in the sixth on RBI singles by
Bagwell and Craig Biggio, the bullpen shut down the Brewers. The last
12 Brewers were retired.</TE>
<TE>   Cincinnati 7, Pittsburgh 5--Jason LaRue hit a grand slam with two
out in the eighth inning after an intentional walk to cap a five-run
rally by the Reds at Pittsburgh.</TE>
<TE>   Even after LaRue homered, the Reds still needed left fielder
Russell Branyan's run-saving catch in Pittsburgh's three-run eighth
to wrap up their fourth victory in five games.</TE>
<TE>   Chicago 6, Philadelphia 4--Matt Clement gave up two runs in 6 1/3
innings and Fred McGriff hit a three-run homer to lead the Cubs at
Philadelphia. The Cubs ended a two-game losing streak, winning for
the sixth time in nine games since Bruce Kimm replaced Don Baylor as
manager.</TE>

<HD>Arrests Made in Greece</HD>
<DH>Olympics: Police say they have seven members of notorious
terror group in custody, a key step in securing 2004 Games.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ALAN ABRAHAMSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>With about two years to go before the Athens 2004 Summer Olympics,
Greek authorities announced Thursday a "great success" in penetrating
the elusive terrorist group 17 November, saying they had captured a
reputed leader of the radical leftist cell and secured confessions
from others to a variety of attacks.</LD>
<LD>   In all, Athens Police Chief Fotis Nassiakos told a news
conference, seven alleged group members were in custody, the first
arrests since 17 November surfaced 27 years ago with the killing of
Athens CIA station chief Richard Welch.</LD>
<LD>   The group, which is called N17 in security circles, has since
claimed credit for nearly two dozen killings, including four
Americans. Also claimed among its victims: Dimitrios Angelopoulos, an
elderly Greek industrialist assassinated on an Athens street in 1986.
His nephew's wife, Gianna Angelopoulos-Daskalaki, now heads the
Athens 2004 organizing committee. N17's most recent victim was the
British defense attache, Brig. Stephen Saunders, shot four times in
his car near Athens' Olympic Stadium in June 2000.</LD>
<TE>   Olympic officials, the U.S. State Department and experts on Greek
affairs expressed hope that developments in Athens had indeed marked
a breakthrough--both in rooting out N17 and securing the Olympics,
which begin Aug. 13, 2004.</TE>
<TE>   "We have to be careful not to be overly optimistic," said Denis
Oswald, a Swiss lawyer and International Olympic Committee member who
serves as the chief IOC liaison to the 2004 Games. "But it's a good
indication. I can definitely support, definitely use the words
'cautious optimism.' "</TE>
<TE>   Wayne Merry, a former U.S. diplomat in Athens who has been sharply
critical of Greek authorities over the years for failing to make more
progress in penetrating N17, said, "As of today, I am reasonably
optimistic."</TE>
<TE>   Merry, now senior associate at the American Foreign Policy Council
in Washington, added, "What we have now is very positive results from
real police work, though much of the police work was British rather
than Greek. True. What remains to be seen is what the Greek
prosecutors and courts, who in the past have been very lenient toward
terrorist suspects, will do."</TE>
<TE>   Angelopoulos-Daskalaki could not be reached for comment. Speaking
Wednesday in Athens with the editor who heads USA Today's Olympic
coverage, she said, "Our priority is to create this security so that
[Olympic visitors] can walk under the Acropolis, on the beaches, at
volleyball or track and field. I am very proud of the progress being
made."</TE>
<TE>   Before the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks in the U.S., Greek
authorities had said they planned to spend about $600 million on
security for the Games. Now some insiders say the tab may approach $1
billion.</TE>
<TE>   The break in the case came with the June 29 arrest of Savas Xiros,
a 40-year-old religious icon painter. He was taken into custody after
being severely injured, allegedly when a bomb he was carrying
exploded.</TE>
<TE>   Xiros' arrest and the widespread publication of his photo in Greek
newspapers yielded clues that led police to raid two N17 hideouts,
where police found a stash of weaponry.</TE>
<TE>   Two of Xiros' brothers were then arrested. Christodoulos Xiros,
44, reportedly has confessed to involvement in attacks that led to
nine deaths from 1984 to 1992, including two U.S. military officials.
Vassilis Xiros, 30, reportedly confessed to taking part in the
shooting death of Saunders, as well as other attacks.</TE>
<TE>   In one hideout, police also found the fingerprints of Alexandros
Giotopoulos, 58. Living under the assumed name of Michaelis Economou,
he was arrested Wednesday on a hydrofoil as he made ready to leave
the Aegean island of Lipsi, where he has a home. Authorities allege
he is N17's chief philosopher.</TE>
<TE>   N17 takes its name from the date in 1973 that the military junta
then ruling Greece crushed a student uprising. The group for years
expressed a vehement anti-American philosophy.</TE>

<LD>Aaron Martens has been traveling so much lately, he has to think
twice about where he is.</LD>
<LD>   "I'm in Missouri right now, I think," he said Monday afternoon
when reached on his cell phone. "I've been through like 20 states in
the last week. It's crazy."</LD>
<LD>   Martens and his wife Lesley were en route from their home in
Castaic to Birmingham, Ala., where they recently bought a second
home.</LD>
<TE>   As for the craziness, it's only beginning. The Citgo Bassmasters
Classic is next week and 52 of the world's top anglers, along with
their entourages, are rolling into the Birmingham area.</TE>
<TE>   The three-day event, which begins Thursday, is expected to draw
more than 60,000 spectators, some of whom will catch the action live
from their boats on sprawling Lay Lake, while others pack the
Birmingham-Jefferson Civic Center for the daily weigh-ins.</TE>
<TE>   It's considered the Super Bowl of bass fishing. Just qualifying
means you've reached the top of your game. Winning puts you over the
top. You pocket $200,000 (this year's top prize) but can earn five
times that through sponsorships and endorsements.</TE>
<TE>   Martens, a former gas station attendant, will be participating in
his fourth consecutive Classic.</TE>
<TE>   His best finish was eighth in 2000, but he would have finished
third had his watch been working properly.</TE>
<TE>   He was penalized three pounds for arriving three minutes late for
one of the weigh-ins. The mistake cost him $9,500. He now keeps two
watches on his boat.</TE>
<TE>   His worst finish was last year, when he floundered for three days
on the Louisiana Delta and finished 43rd out of 45 anglers. "I'm much
more at home in a reservoir," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Lay Lake, an impoundment of the Coosa River located about 40 miles
from Birmingham, features all types of water and habitat, and very
much suits Martens' finesse style of fishing. He has fished the lake
numerous times, most recently in late June, the last time the pros
were allowed to fish in advance of the Classic.</TE>
<TE>   "I just crushed 'em," he said.</TE>
<TE>   They can "pre-fish" again Tuesday and Wednesday, when, Martens
proclaimed, "I'll be in full Classic mode."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Martens is the most successful of three California entries (Robert
Lee of Angels Camp in Northern California and Mike O'Shea of Thousand
Oaks are the others). He has won numerous tournaments since turning
pro in 1988 and has built a reputation as one of the world's most
skilled and intuitive anglers.</TE>
<TE>   "How do I like his style of fishing? I hate it because it's
totally opposite of what I do," says defending champion Kevin VanDam,
an aggressive fisherman who prefers fast-moving lures over plastic
worms. "But it's very effective for him even if it isn't for others.</TE>
<TE>   "What sets Aaron apart is that he's very in tune with what's going
on around him. He notices the subtle things the bass tell him by how
they're biting or not biting, and he's able to make the slightest
changes [in presentation] that often turn out to be very productive."</TE>
<TE>   Whether this will be Martens' year remains to be seen, but his
biggest fan is hoping so.</TE>
<TE>   "On July 27 I have a very significant birthday and I'll be there
right in the front row for the weigh-in," said Carol Martens, Aaron's
mother and a reputable bass pro herself. "I told Aaron that it would
be a real happy birthday for me if he were to win the Classic."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Martens is a strong believer in catch and release and says that
philosophy is one of the reasons bass are generally bigger in
California than anywhere else.</TE>
<TE>   He wishes it would spread east and south, but no such movement is
catching on.</TE>
<TE>   "Everybody kills fish. It's like it was 50 years ago," Martens
says. "Lay Lake is one of the healthiest fisheries I've seen, in
terms of bait and the number of small bass, but the fishery is
hurting because the bass don't have a chance to grow. They never make
it past five pounds. My goal in life is to change all that."</TE>
<TE>   That may prove harder than winning the Classic.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   VanDam, 34, won last year's event with a total weight of 32 pounds
5 ounces for three days of five-fish limits. When he was announced as
the winner, before a raucous Louisiana Superdome crowd, he said he
had never been so nervous.</TE>
<TE>   He's a lot calmer now. Reached this week at his home in Kalamazoo,
Mich., VanDam said that finally winning the Classic, on his 11th
attempt, meant as much personally as it did professionally.</TE>
<TE>   "It was the goal I had been shooting for my entire career, so for
me it was a tremendous personal accomplishment," he said. "This is
the No. 1 title in our sport. The Classic is the biggest thing we've
got going for us."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The event will be televised live on ESPN2 on July 25-26 from 2-3
p.m. and on ESPN from 4-5 p.m. on July 27.</TE>
<TE>   Bragging Rights</TE>
<TE>   * Redondo Beach: While fishing aboard Redondo Sportfishing's Betty
G last Friday morning, I discovered that bigger, newer and faster do
not always mean much.</TE>
<TE>   The boat is small, old and slow. But it is fishy. Fishing first
off the Palos Verdes Peninsula and then over a sunken barge only a
mile beyond the breakwater, five of us enjoyed one of the most
wide-open calico bass bites of the season--while the anglers aboard
the other vessels were largely getting skunked.</TE>
<TE>   Capt. Eric Hobday credited the lack of a generator, making the
vessel totally silent during stops.</TE>
<TE>   In all, we caught about 70 bass, the largest being a pair of
four-pounders by Patrick Friedman, 7, of Torrance.</TE>
<TE>   * San Diego: Charles Brame of Alta Loma won the jackpot aboard San
Diego's Spirit of Adventure recently with a 33.9-pound bluefin tuna.</TE>
<TE>   * Pyramid Lake: The preteen duo of Pedro and Hugo Revera of San
Fernando worked together to reel in a 31-pound striped bass.</TE>

<TE>   Southland anglers can express their views Thursday in regard to
various rockfish management options being considered for 2003 by the
Pacific Fishery Management Council. A public meeting will be held
from 7-10 p.m. at the Department of Fish and Game office at 4665
Lampson Ave., Los Alamitos.</TE>
<TE>   Several species of rockfish--notably bocaccio, canary and
yelloweye--are believed to be severely overfished and the new
regulations, which will probably be adopted in September, will be
highly restrictive.</TE>
<TE>   It'll Never Fly</TE>
<TE>   The DFG this week issued an advisory asking fishermen to avoid
casting near seabirds feeding on fish in the same area, citing the
harmful effects hooks and fishing line have on pelicans and gulls.</TE>
<TE>   Such a request is sure to fall on deaf ears in Southern
California, where fishermen actually look for and follow birds diving
on fish chased to the surface by game fish.</TE>
<TE>   A fair number of birds do get hooked, but for the most part
they're the ones that persistently follow the fishing boats, as sea
lions do, diving after bait fish being cast overboard by fishermen.</TE>
<TE>   Rocking the Boat</TE>
<TE>   The August issue of Boating magazine contains the following
tidbits the author insists are true: During World War II, Winston
Churchill approved a plan to construct aircraft carriers from
icebergs; the gimlet cocktail was invented for ships' officers by a
British naval surgeon as a healthier alternative to straight gin;
Alexander Graham Bell tried to have the word "ahoy" instead of
"hello" adopted as the proper greeting when answering telephones; the
first Spanish, English and French vessels to reach America's shores
were captained by Italians.</TE>

<HD>Mexico Still Unhappy</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GRAHAME L. JONES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Mexico's soccer fans, already unhappy at their team's so-so
performance in the World Cup, are voicing their displeasure over the
fact that a foreign coach is being considered to replace Javier
"Vasco" Aguirre.</LD>
<LD>   Alberto de la Torre, president of the Mexican soccer federation,
said earlier this week that Argentina's World Cup coach, Marcelo
Bielsa, is a candidate to take over from Aguirre, who resigned after
the World Cup.</LD>
<LD>   Also on the list of potential replacements are former Mexico
standout Hugo Sanchez, along with two other foreign but Mexico-based
coaches: Argentine Ricardo Lavolpe and Brazilian Ricardo Ferreti.</LD>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Aguirre, now coaching Osasuna in the Spanish league,
accepted the blame for Mexico's 2-0 loss to the United States in the
second round of Korea/Japan '02 by saying he had made a tactical
mistake by substituting forward Luis Hernandez for midfielder Ramon
Morales.</TE>
<TE>   World Cup Referee Admits Error</TE>
<TE>   Ali Tomusange, the assistant referee whose incorrect call in the
World Cup quarterfinals cost Spain a game-winning goal and eventually
allowed South Korea to reach the semifinals, Thursday admitted he
might have erred.</TE>
<TE>   "I could have made a mistake when I raised my flag and disallowed
the goal [in sudden-death overtime by Spain's Fernando Morientes],"
Tomusange told Reuters in Uganda, where he was being honored by the
government for his part in the tournament. "I have no regrets. I
tried my level best to do what I could do and I achieved my goals."</TE>
<TE>   Morientes headed the ball into the net off a cross by Joaquin, but
Tomusange ruled that the ball was out of play when Joaquin made the
pass. TV replays showed that it was completely in play and that
Tomusange was not in position to make the call.</TE>
<TE>   Copa Libertadores Finalists</TE>
<TE>   Olimpia of Paraguay and Sao Caetano of Brazil have advanced to the
final of the Copa Libertadores, South America's annual club
championship.</TE>
<TE>   The Paraguayan team did so the hard way, winning the first game of
the two-game series, 3-2, in Asuncion, Paraguay, then losing the
return, 1-0, in Porto Alegre, Brazil, on Wednesday night before
prevailing on penalty kicks, 5-4.</TE>
<TE>   Even the shootout was not without controversy because Argentine
referee Daniel Gimenez ordered Olimpia striker Mauro Caballero to
re-take his penalty kick after ruling that Gremio goalkeeper Eduardo
had moved off his line before the shot was taken and therefore his
save was nullified.</TE>
<TE>   The decision led to angry scenes and a delay as police had to
remove protesting Gremio officials.</TE>
<TE>   Olimpia won the Copa Libertadores in 1979 and 1990.</TE>
<TE>   In this year's two-legged final, to played Wednesday in Asuncion,
Paraguay, and July 31 in Sao Paulo, Brazil, it will face an
unheralded Sao Caetano team that not too many years ago was
struggling in the second division.</TE>
<TE>   But the Sao Paulo-based club reached the final by eliminating a
team with greater pedigree, Club America of Mexico. Sao Caetano
earned a 2-0 shutout at home and then held Club America to a 1-1 tie
Tuesday night in the rain in front of 60,000 fans at Azteca Stadium
in Mexico City.</TE>
<TE>   The Copa Libertadores winner will play European champion Real
Madrid of Spain in the Toyota/Intercontinental Cup on Dec. 3 in
Yokohama, Japan, for the mythical world club championship.</TE>
<TE>   It's Chinese to Everton</TE>
<TE>   Soccer's global reach was underlined when Everton of the English
Premier League announced that it had signed a two-year,
multimillion-dollar agreement to be sponsored by the Chinese cellular
telephone company Kejian.</TE>
<TE>   As part of the deal--the first between a Chinese company and a
leading European club--World Cup defender Li Weifeng of China will
join Everton on a one-year loan, two Chinese youth team players will
train with the club and Everton will send coaches to China to help
develop the sport there and will travel to China for exhibition
matches.</TE>
<TE>   Li will become the second Chinese player in the Premier League,
joining national teammate Sun Jihai, signed by Manchester City.</TE>
<TE>   Hungary Rejects Matthaeus</TE>
<TE>   Former World Cup winner Lothar Matthaeus of Germany, who in his
first stint as a coach last season led Rapid Vienna of Austria to its
worst finish in 128 years before being fired, claimed Thursday that
Hungary wants him to coach its national team.</TE>
<TE>   The claim, made in an interview with Germany's Bild newspaper, was
immediately rejected by the Hungarian soccer federation, which said
it had not been in contact with Matthaeus and that it was quite
satisfied with its current coach, Imre Gellei.</TE>
<TE>   Seaman Sticks Around</TE>
<TE>   England goalkeeper David Seaman, who left the field in tears after
conceding the winning goal to Brazil in the quarterfinals of the
World Cup, signed a one-year contract to remain at Arsenal.</TE>
<TE>   Seaman, 38, who last season led Arsenal to the English Premier
League title and the F.A. Cup, had considered retiring. His future as
England's first-choice goalkeeper, however, remains in doubt.</TE>

<HD>Sparks Pushed Around by Liberty in 72-59 Loss</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Tamika Whitmore and Tari Phillips came up big against the defending
champion Sparks.</LD>
<LD>   Whitmore scored 25 points and Phillips had 12 points and nine
rebounds as the New York Liberty defeated the bigger Sparks, 72-59,
in a physical game Thursday night in front of 15,619 at New York.</LD>
<LD>   "They probably have the best post players in the league, but I can
score against bigger players," the 6-foot-2 Whitmore said. "My mom is
6-7--I've had a lot of practice."</LD>
<TE>   Becky Hammon had 10 points for the Liberty, which outrebounded Los
Angeles, 20-10, in the second half and 35-26 overall. Lisa Leslie led
the Sparks with 16 points and Mwadi Mabika had 15.</TE>
<TE>   "New York did what it does best--they flexed their muscles and
took this one from us," Spark Coach Michael Cooper said.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the physical confrontations involved Spark forward DeLisha
Milton, who tussled with Teresa Weatherspoon early in the second
half, with both players receiving technical fouls. Milton then threw
an elbow on a rebound, earning her a fourth personal foul, and got
tangled with Phillips as they both earned fouls.</TE>
<TE>   Leslie got in trouble down the stretch too, receiving two quick
fouls, one on an offensive rebound and another on the defensive end.
She played the last 8:08 with five fouls.</TE>
<TE>   "We planned to take it inside because Tari and Tamika just have it
right now," New York Coach Richie Adubato said. "Leslie has been in
foul trouble lately, but we are going to take it inside regardless of
who's in there. That's our game."</TE>
<TE>   Weatherspoon made two baskets to break a 35-35 tie, and Crystal
Robinson sank a three-point basket to give the Liberty a 42-35 lead.</TE>
<TE>   Mabika scored four quick points as the Sparks ran the fastbreak
well to cut it to 46-41, but the Liberty pulled away again.</TE>
<TE>   "We just got outhustled for about the last five minutes of the
game and that was pretty much it," Leslie said. "They picked it up in
the second half, and that was the key."</TE>
<TE>   Whitmore was fouled while making a layup but missed the free
throw. Vickie Johnson, though, grabbed the rebound and made an open
layup for a 50-43 lead. Whitmore then went inside on three
consecutive possessions, making one free throw and scoring on two
acrobatic layups.</TE>
<TE>   The Sparks stayed in the game on three-pointers from Milton and
Sophia Witherspoon, but the Liberty got a jumper from Johnson, a
three-pointer from Becky Hammon and a putback from Phillips to start
a 12-2 run that put the game away.</TE>
<TE>   "I want them to think about me," Phillips said. " ... They have to
bring their best game against me."</TE>
<TE>   Washington 63, Detroit 59--Vicky Bullett scored 22 points,
including a go-ahead three-pointer in the last minute, as the Mystics
(15-6) won in front of 19,766 at Washington.</TE>
<TE>   After Swin Cash's layup gave Detroit (3-17) a 59-57 lead, Bullett
made a 23-foot jumper with 20.7 seconds left to put Washington up,
60-59. Bullett was 10 of 11 from the field and had eight rebounds.</TE>

<HD>The Yearning for Hingis, Davenport</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>LISA DILLMAN</AU>

<DL></DL>
<LD>It didn't happen every day, certainly. But at the French Open, and
with increasing frequency at Wimbledon, a reporter would start
thinking about Martina Hingis and her ability to say anything about
anybody.</LD>
<LD>   Sometimes you would hear a reporter say, "I miss Martina Hingis."</LD>
<LD>   In reality, missing Hingis also meant feeling the absence of
Lindsay Davenport. The players are linked, after all, having mostly
held the top two spots before Venus and Serena Williams ascended.</LD>
<TE>   Hingis, 21, and Davenport, 26, also balanced each other off the
court. It seemed as though it was the job of Hingis to stir up
controversy, and then it was Davenport's assignment to put the events
into calm, mature perspective.</TE>
<TE>   So when they missed the French Open and Wimbledon--Hingis
recovering from left ankle surgery and Davenport from right knee
surgery--their absence loomed larger. With the two players having
been on crutches, you could say the crutches for the media were gone.</TE>
<TE>   Hingis' future appears uncertain--though there are reports she may
seek a wild-card entry to the U.S. Open--but Davenport's injury exile
ends this weekend as she will represent the United States in Fed Cup
against Israel before the California hard-court events at Palo Alto,
San Diego and Manhattan Beach.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not really expecting to come out and start winning these
tournaments right away," Davenport said Thursday in a conference
call. "The injury is out of my mind already. I haven't felt in the
last few weeks that I shouldn't go for a shot because of my knee. In
the beginning, it was tough to push yourself to jump up for that
overhead or to go wide."</TE>
<TE>   Davenport has been off the tour since the season-ending
championships in November in Munich, Germany. She injured her knee
playing against Kim Clijsters in a third-set tiebreaker in the
semifinals of that tournament. Though Davenport won the match and
regained the No. 1 ranking, she could not play the final against
Serena Williams.</TE>
<TE>   She knew immediately it was a serious injury.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm in my room absolutely bawling," Davenport said in a earlier
interview at her tennis club in Newport Beach. "[Coach] Robert [Van't
Hof] comes in and he's not sure if I'm happy. He's like, 'What's
wrong?' It was so weird, such a bizarre way to end the season."</TE>
<TE>   The hardest part for her was missing the Australian Open. Instead
of playing in a tuneup in Sydney, she went to Colorado to have
surgery performed by noted specialist Dr. Richard Steadman. At first,
Davenport was stunned by the result of the MRI exam.</TE>
<TE>   "The radiologist said, 'Well, you've done it this time,' "
Davenport said. "I've had about 20 MRIs on about every possible body
part, and it's always been, 'Oh, you're fine.' This time it was,
'You're going to need something done.' I was like, 'Are you kidding?'
"</TE>
<TE>   Shortly after the surgery, Davenport was doing rehabilitation on
the knee, and spotted Chanda Rubin coming out of surgery. Rubin was
able to return in time for the clay-court season.</TE>
<TE>   Davenport wasn't so lucky. She spent nine weeks on crutches, and
had her knee placed for eight hours each day in a machine that
straightened and bent her leg. Shortly before the French Open, she
was cleared to resume practicing at full speed.</TE>
<TE>   "I've always had confidence I was going to be OK," she said. "I
haven't had any setbacks, which has been phenomenal. In any surgery,
you can have swelling. I have no reason to think it won't be OK. I've
had to take it slow.</TE>
<TE>   "It was good I started that way. After the first week, I had
blisters, my shoulder hurt. Isn't that crazy?"</TE>
<TE>   Months later, Davenport managed to find a positive element about
her long layoff.</TE>
<TE>   "I do think that this will prolong my career,'' she said. "The
break has helped me to play probably a couple of more years than I
would have. It's been refreshing in terms where I miss tennis a lot.
When I was in the hospital, everything went through my mind, 'OK,
I've got to get back. I really want to come back and do well again. I
don't want to end my career this way.' "</TE>
<TE>   Davenport took issue with an observation on the conference call
that her initial expectations might be too low.</TE>
<TE>   "Well, you probably weren't on crutches for nine weeks," she said.
"I want to do great out there. I'm not coming back to lose in the
first round, and I'm sorry if you took that out of it. But I'm not
going to over-expect anything for myself and think I'm going to win
the first tournament back.... That's just setting yourself up for
failure."</TE>

<HD>Climb to Top Is All Armstrong</HD>
<DH>Cycling: Three-time defending champion takes overall lead
by winning first mountain stage.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KEITH B. RICHBURG</AU>
<BD>WASHINGTON POST</BD>
<DL>PARIS</DL>
<LD>This time around, 13 must be Lance Armstrong's lucky number.</LD>
<LD>   Thursday, he won a stage in the Tour de France race for the 13th
time in his career, and the victory in the first mountain stage was
enough to give him the overall lead in the race and the yellow
leader's jersey for the first time since he won the prologue in
Luxembourg on July 6.</LD>
<LD>   And he won with an impressive performance in the Pyrenees, erasing
doubts that had arisen after the surprise upset he suffered Monday in
the first individual time trial, defeated that day at the hands of a
tenacious Colombian rider.</LD>
<TE>   That rare loss for Armstrong set rivals chattering about how the
three-time defending champion was simply not as strong as in the
past, and how the Tour had now been changed.</TE>
<TE>   But Thursday, Armstrong proved he is still King of the Mountains.
And he did it with a ride that seemed at times almost effortless,
boosted along by impressive performances from his U.S. Postal
teammates.</TE>
<TE>   Armstrong came in first on the ride from Pau to the ski resort of
La Mongie, seven seconds ahead of Spaniard Joseba Beloki. But just
behind Beloki was Armstrong's teammate, Roberto Heras, 13 seconds
back.</TE>
<TE>   Armstrong afterward had warm words for Heras and all his
teammates.</TE>
<TE>   "To me, he was the stage winner," he said of Heras. "To me, the
biggest takeaway is the team, and the performance of the team."</TE>
<TE>   Heras, he said, set a "very, very rapid pace."</TE>
<TE>   The performance began with American George Hincapie leading the
blue line into the mountains. His lead position was soon taken over
by Spaniard Jose Luis Rubiera.</TE>
<TE>   And by the end it was Heras and Armstrong, riding strong, pushing
each other, taking control of the race.</TE>
<TE>   Armstrong sprinted out the last 200 yards to pass Beloki and take
the overall race lead by 1 minute 12 seconds.</TE>
<TE>   The previous yellow jersey holder, another Spaniard, Igor Gonzalez
de Galdeano, is third, 1:48 behind. Armstrong had been 26 seconds
behind at the start of this stage.</TE>
<TE>   Armstrong completed Thursday's stage in 4 hours 21 minutes 57
seconds.</TE>
<TE>   Armstrong said he considered letting Heras win the stage but was
more worried about Beloki and the necessity to gain points on the
rider emerging as the Texan's chief rival. With the race so close,
every second counts.</TE>
<TE>   In previous Tours, Armstrong has used his climbing ability to
attack in the mountains and build insurmountable leads over his
rivals, usually by several minutes. But perhaps in an indication of
how this Tour remains in suspense, his lead this time after this
first mountain stage is relatively slim, and rivals still lurk in the
background.</TE>
<TE>   No one seems more aware of that than Armstrong.</TE>
<TE>   "Beloki's good," Armstrong said of the second-place finisher.
"He's a threat, and we have to take all the time possible."</TE>
<TE>   Another grueling mountain stage beckons today, 124 miles to the
Plateau de Beille.</TE>
<TE>   The race ends in Paris on July 28. Armstrong is trying to become
the first American to win four consecutive Tours.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Cycling's governing body and the World Anti-Doping agency clashed
Thursday over test results that showed Gonzalez de Galdeano was using
a banned substance.</TE>
<TE>   WADA, which oversees drug testing for most Olympic sports, said
the test results from Gonzalez de Galdeano should be considered
positive because they showed levels of the stimulant salbutamol well
above the limits.</TE>
<TE>   "For us, the medical justification [for using salbutamol] doesn't
apply above 1,000 nanograms" per milliliter, Alain Garnier, the
director of WADA's European office, told the Associated Press.</TE>
<TE>   He was spared punishment by the international cycling union
because he used the drug to treat asthma.</TE>
<TE>   Test results showed a concentration of 1,360 nanograms per
milliliter in his sample.</TE>
<TE>   The cycling union said it considered the test result negative and
issued a statement to counter the claim by Garnier, who didn't
comment directly on Gonzalez de Galdeano's case.</TE>
<TE>   "There is no positive result and the discussion over the levels of
salbutamol found in Galdeano is closed," the cycling union said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Associated Press contributed to this report.</TE>

<TE>   (BEGIN TEXT OF INFOBOX)</TE>
<TE>   Highlights from the 11th stage:</TE>
<TE>   Stage: A 97.96-mile mountainous stretch from Pau to La Mongie,
high in the Pyrenees.</TE>
<TE>   Winner: Three-time defending champion Lance Armstrong, in 4 hours
21 minutes 57 seconds. He also claimed the overall lead.</TE>
<TE>   How others fared: Joseba Beloki finished second, seven seconds
behind Armstrong, and was 1:12 behind the Texan in the overall
standings. Spain's Igor Gonzalez de Galdeano finished in 11th place
and lost the yellow jersey. He dropped from first to third overall,
1:48 behind Armstrong.</TE>
<TE>   Quote of the day: "For me, Roberto is the stage winner. He
sacrificed everything for me and the team, and I'm very
grateful."--Armstrong on U.S. Postal Service teammate Roberto Heras,
who led the surge up the last climb, then moved aside for Armstrong
in the final few hundred yards.</TE>
<TE>   Next stage: Today's 12th stage is 124 miles from Lannemezan to the
Plateau de Beille in the Pyrenees.</TE>

<KH>TV-RADIO LARRY STEWART</KH>
<HD>There's Tumult at ESPN Radio</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LARRY STEWART</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>There must be something about sports talk radio that makes things so
turbulent. Or, as Bob Costas might say, it's a wacky business.</LD>
<LD>   Jay Mariotti, upset with management about how his show was
marketed, among other things, abruptly left the Sporting News Network
in March.</LD>
<LD>   Also in March, Dave Smith and Steve Carbone got fired by KXTA
(1150) for obscenities in a column by Carbone on a Web site
controlled by Smith.</LD>
<TE>   In May, Jason Jackson, who had a national midday show on ESPN
Radio, was fired, allegedly for comments in e-mails to colleagues
that had sexual overtones and were deemed inappropriate.</TE>
<TE>   This week came the news that Washington Post sports columnist Tony
Kornheiser was suspended for a week for comments he made on his
national morning show on ESPN Radio. Kornheiser was critical of ESPN
management after his senior producer, Denis Horgan Jr., and an
associate producer, Kelvin Alvarez, were fired last month.</TE>
<TE>   Kornheiser's suspension brought to light not only the firings of
Horgan and Alvarez but also the dismissals of two producers who
worked on Dan Patrick's show. Also, five other ESPN employees who
worked at the network headquarters in Bristol, Conn., were suspended.</TE>
<TE>   According to sources, the firings and suspensions were for
clicking on to adult Web sites and forwarding material to colleagues.</TE>
<TE>   After the Jackson matter, ESPN began monitoring computer use by
employees.</TE>
<TE>   But the story gets even more intriguing.</TE>
<TE>   Kornheiser was particularly irked at the firing of Horgan, whom he
calls extremely loyal and talented. After he complained about it on
the air, he was told to refrain from such comments by ESPN Radio's
general manager, Eric Schoenfeld.</TE>
<TE>   But Kornheiser continued to discuss the matter during commercial
breaks, which until about three weeks ago could be heard over the
Internet.</TE>
<TE>   Schoenfeld also was displeased that Kornheiser read an Associated
Press story about the elaborate goody bags presenters at the recent
ESPY Awards show would be getting. Kornheiser had a running gag about
the bags, saying he wanted one.</TE>
<TE>   According to sources, Schoenfeld, in Bristol, warned Kornheiser's
two new producers that he'd "beat them to a bloody pulp," or
something like that, if Kornheiser continued to mention the goody
bags.</TE>
<TE>   The two producers in turn reported Schoenfeld to ESPN's human
resources department, saying they were physically threatened. That
led to Schoenfeld being suspended for a week.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Horgan has been hired by Keith Olbermann to help him
write his "Speaking of Sports" and "Speaking of Everything"
commentaries for ABC Radio.</TE>
<TE>   "Denis is just one of the funniest, one of the brightest guys, one
of the most loyal, one of the best workers I've ever worked with,"
Olbermann told the Hartford Courant. "If you've got rules that force
you to get rid of a decent guy like Denis Horgan, there's something
wrong with your rules."</TE>
<TE>   As for Kornheiser, he remains perplexed by his suspension, which
included television as well. He and fellow Post columnist Michael
Wilbon are the co-hosts of ESPN's "Pardon the Interruption."</TE>
<TE>   "When my agent called me [last Friday] and told me I was suspended
for a week, I was stunned," Kornheiser said from Washington on
Thursday. "My agent only told me there were a series of things that
bothered management.</TE>
<TE>   "I still haven't talked to anyone from ESPN, but I would sure love
to hear from someone."</TE>
<TE>   Kornheiser does his show from the ESPN Zone in Washington. His
producers are in Bristol. He said he's not aware of much that goes on
in Bristol and hadn't heard anything about improper use of company
computers involving adult Web sites.</TE>
<TE>   Kornheiser said after this week he is taking a pre-planned
two-week vacation.</TE>
<TE>   Chris Moore is filling in for Kornheiser on radio, and Miami
Herald columnist Dan Le Batard  is occupying his TV seat.</TE>
<TE>   Kornheiser has done his ESPN Radio show since January 1998. It is
carried by 243 stations, including KSPN (1110) in Los Angeles
weekdays from 7-10 a.m.</TE>
<TE>   He reportedly has a five-year contract with ESPN that pays him
$500,000 a year.</TE>
<TE>   "I think I have a relatively conservative show," he said. "I stay
away from bad language and think I do a good job. I want to come back
after my vacation, but I don't know what they're thinking."</TE>
<TE>   An ESPN spokesman declined to comment, saying the network does not
discuss personnel matters. However the spokesman said Kornheiser is
expected back Aug. 5.</TE>
<TE>   Open Confusion</TE>
<TE>   ESPN was scheduled to go on the air with the first round of the
British Open at 5 a.m. Thursday. But ESPN actually came on the air at
4:30 a.m. with "bonus coverage," since Tiger Woods teed off at 1:10
a.m. PDT. The bonus coverage enabled ESPN to show Woods live on the
16th and 17th holes. He parred both.</TE>
<TE>   The problem was that ESPN didn't decide on the bonus coverage
until it was too late to publicize it. So unless you happen to have
been up at 4:30 a.m. Thursday watching "SportsCenter," you probably
missed it.</TE>
<TE>   With Woods teeing off at 5:57 a.m. PDT today, ESPN will be able to
show his entire round.</TE>
<TE>   Proper Perspective</TE>
<TE>   How impressive would it be if Woods won the British Open and PGA
Championship to complete the Grand Slam?</TE>
<TE>   "It would be the biggest thing to ever happen in sports," ABC's
Curtis Strange said on the phone from Muirfield on Wednesday. "I may
be biased because I'm a golfer, but I really think it would be."</TE>
<TE>   Jack Nicklaus recently said no one is stepping up to challenge
Woods.</TE>
<TE>   "That's sort of a slap at Tiger," Strange said. "The other guys
are trying, it's just that Tiger is that much better than everyone
else."</TE>
<TE>   Recommended Viewing</TE>
<TE>   At 11:30 a.m. Saturday, following ABC's Open coverage, will be a
one-hour special, "Inside the Ropes at the British Open," featuring
Jesper Parnevik, Mark O'Meara and David Duval.</TE>
<TE>   The show is being produced by TWI, the television arm of Mark
McCormack's IMG, which represents the three golfers, as well as
Woods. Woods is shown playing two practice rounds with O'Meara in
Ireland, but the other three are the stars of the show.</TE>
<TE>   On ABC after the Open at 10:30 a.m. Sunday will be the Michael
Douglas and Friends Celebrity tournament, taped last month at Ojai.
Douglas is paired with his wife, Catherine Zeta-Jones. The field also
includes James Garner, Samuel L. Jackson, Martin Sheen, James Woods
and others.</TE>
<TE>   Short Waves</TE>
<TE>   Fox Sports Net has begun using a new camera on Dodger and Angel
telecasts.</TE>
<TE>   It's attached to the screen behind home plate and provides a nice
panoramic view of the batter and the infielders. Not as impressive is
the picture-in-picture innovation that made its debut on the Dodger
game Wednesday night. It's too distracting.</TE>
<TE>   Lanny Wadkins, who has replaced Ken Venturi at CBS, officially
assumes his new role this weekend at the SBC Senior Open.... Look for
it to be announced that former USC and Chicago Bear defensive end Tim
Ryan has been hired as an NFL commentator by Fox.... Stuart Scott
will succeed Mike Tirico on ESPN's "Monday Night Countdown." Scott
makes his debut July 29.... Tom Tolbert told the Contra Costa Times
he has been hired by ABC and ESPN to work as an NBA game analyst and
studio analyst next season.... ESPN will present its first "ESPN 100"
Tuesday at 5 p.m. The 1 1/2-hour show will list the top athletes,
moments and various developments in sports so far this year. No. 8 is
the Lakers' three-peat.</TE>
<TE>   Radio Daze</TE>
<TE>   It's official. Todd Donoho and Dave Stone have been given the 1-4
p.m. slot on KSPN. Joe McDonnell and Doug Krikorian, who return from
vacation Monday, will be on one less hour, from 4-7 p.m.... John
Fricke and Shelley Smith did a nice job filling in for McDonnell and
Krikorian.</TE>
<TE>   The latest Arbitron rating shows that KXTA ranks No. 1 among L.A.
sports stations with a 1.3 share among men 25-54. XTRA (690) is
second with a 1.0, KSPN is third with a 0.7 and KMPC (1540) did not
show up. KXTA draws an average of 130,000 listeners per week among
men 25-54, KSPN 110,000 and KSPN 83,000.</TE>
<TE>   In Closing</TE>
<TE>   Baseball Commissioner Bud Selig is getting it from all angles
these days.</TE>
<TE>   Even former commissioner Fay Vincent, who has been making the
rounds among radio shows, has been ripping him.</TE>
<TE>   Vincent, a guest of Le Batard on ESPN Radio on Sunday, said, "How
do you screw up an All-Star game? That's pretty hard to do." Vincent
also said, "I'd be astonished if there weren't a fair number of
owners who wonder if they're in the right hands."</TE>
<TE>   At least Selig called Fox's Jeanne Zelasko this week to apologize
for not being available for an interview at the end of the All-Star
game.</TE>

<HD>Unser to Seek Help for Alcohol</HD>
<DH>Motor racing: Al Jr. will enter treatment center. Charges
dropped in incident with girlfriend.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SHAV GLICK</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Two-time Indianapolis 500 winner Al Unser Jr., acknowledging that he
has been plagued by alcohol-related problems for some time, said
Thursday that he will enter a treatment center to deal with the
situation.</LD>
<LD>   He will not participate in Saturday night's Indy Racing League
event in Nashville and perhaps several more races.</LD>
<LD>   Unser was arrested early in the morning of July 9 after an
incident in Indianapolis, where he had an altercation with his
girlfriend after the two had spent the evening at a strip club. The
Marion County prosecutor announced that misdemeanor charges would be
dropped after hearing Unser's decision.</LD>
<TE>   "I have a problem with alcohol abuse," Unser said. "Nearly every
poor choice I've made in my life occurred under the influence of
alcohol. I don't understand why I have the problem, but I know I have
to straighten it out. And I now am ready to do so."</TE>
<TE>   Unser made his announcement at a news conference where he was
joined by Tom Kelley, owner of the Kelley Racing team for which Unser
drives, and Gregory W. Gyllstrom, chief executive officer for
Corteco, Unser's car sponsor.</TE>
<TE>   "Al has been a key member of the Corteco family since joining us
earlier this year," Gyllstrom said. "When anyone in our company faces
a difficult problem, we want to do everything we can to help. He has
done a great job for us on and off the track and we enjoy working
with him."</TE>
<TE>   In nine races this season, Unser's best finish was a second to
Jeff Ward at Texas Motor Speedway in the closest finish in IRL
history. He also finished second to Buddy Lazier in an International
Race of Champions last Saturday at Chicagoland Speedway.</TE>
<TE>   Tony Renna, test driver for Kelley Racing, will drive the No. 7
Corteco car until Unser returns from treatment sometime in August.</TE>
<TE>   The July 9 incident was only the latest for the 40-year-old
second-generation driver from Albuquerque.</TE>
<TE>   His ex-wife, Shelley, filed a restraining order after alleging
physical abuse while he was drinking.</TE>
<TE>   "I am embarrassed and sorry for any behavior of mine that has hurt
others in the past," said a contrite Unser. "I know I have a problem
that needs to be addressed, and I now have a plan to straighten it
out. I am ready to enter a substance-abuse center and I look forward
to the help that I know I need."</TE>
<TE>   The center's name or location, or the type of treatment Unser will
receive, was not disclosed.</TE>
<TE>   Unser's drinking was no secret in the racing fraternity, but his
remarkable ability to show up sober on race days kept it undercover.</TE>
<TE>   Tony George, IRL founder and president, has been in Unser's corner
for years, helping to get him a ride in the IRL after he was dropped
by Roger Penske's CART team before the 1999 season.</TE>
<TE>   "I was very disappointed to learn of the events involving Al Unser
Jr. last week," George said in a statement from IRL headquarters.
"Today's announcement is the right thing for him to do, and I fully
support it. All of us who are friends and fans of Al are pleased with
his decision and look forward to his returning to the Indy Racing
League. The league is satisfied with the steps that Al is taking and
does not contemplate any action."</TE>
<TE>   Kelley said that the No. 7 car will be ready for Unser as soon as
he returns.</TE>
<TE>   "Al has done a tremendous job for us this year and we love working
with him," he said. "Although we were disappointed by his actions and
are strongly against substance abuse of any kind, we give him a lot
of credit for dealing with his problem."</TE>
<TE>   Unser joined Kelley, one of the IRL's highest-profile teams, at
the last minute before the start of the 2002 season after the Galles
Racing team dropped out of racing. With Galles, he won two races in
two years.</TE>
<TE>   In a career that began in 1982 as a 19-year-old CART rookie, Unser
won the Indy 500 in 1992 and 1994, the CART championship in 1990 and
1994, and the IROC championship in 1986 and 1998.</TE>
