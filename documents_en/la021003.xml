<LD>My mother used to say that if I kept getting cuts and scrapes from
falling out of trees or cracking up my bike that one of these days I
was going to get blood poisoning and die. But she never warned me
about getting it in a doctor's office.</LD>
<LD>   I didn't even know what blood poisoning was as a kid, although I
suspected it had something to do with the devil. To my mother,
everything did. Satan was never very far away from 98th Avenue.</LD>
<LD>   It wasn't until a few weeks ago that I came face to face with
septicemia, the medical term for what my mother warned me about. I
wasn't climbing trees or riding a bike when it came about. I was
lying on a table in a urologist's office having my prostate gland
poked.</LD>
<TE>   The prostate was fine, but a couple of days later my temperature
shot up to 101 and I began shaking so violently that I was afraid I
might jar something loose. My wife, Cinelli, called the doctor
and--presto!--I was in Tarzana Hospital. They knew right away it was
blood poisoning and started pumping antibiotics into me.</TE>
<TE>   The entire episode seemed to amaze my urologist, who said this
sort of thing happens in one out of every 500 cases of those who had
prostate biopsies. He looked at me as though he'd like to take me
back to the lab for experimentation, but I don't think the
Hippocratic oath allows for human lab rats.</TE>
<TE>   What puzzled him was that he'd given me antibiotics before and
after the test and I still got blood poisoning. My mother was
probably right. It was the devil. He'd come all the way down from
Oakland to do me in.</TE>
<TE>   I don't know how much of this you actually want to know, but since
everyone loves hearing about someone else's travail as a way of
affirming their own good health, I'll go on. However, feel free to
leave and tend the baby or mix a martini, since you're not going to
miss anything vital.</TE>
<TE>   Speaking of which, I had an unnerving experience after two days in
the hospital. It was about 2 o'clock in the morning when I suddenly
awoke to see a figure looming over me. A voice said, "I've come for
your vitals."</TE>
<TE>   Light from the hallway was seeping into my darkened room, and the
figure's skin was dark so it looked as though it was an apparition
with no face. When the figure said it wanted my vitals, I took that
to mean it was sent from hell to rip out my heart and brain and maybe
my soul. That's what too much religion does to you as a kid.</TE>
<TE>   The apparition turned out to be a nurse who had come to take my
blood pressure and temperature. I was glad she was there because my
fever had spiked and I was getting those convulsive chills that
caused me to flop about the bed like a fish on a boat deck.</TE>
<TE>   I was wheeled into the intensive care unit and plugged into
machines that monitored every bodily function one can imagine. A
cardiologist came in because my heart rate had shot up, and I was in
kind of a dream state before I was out of it all together. I read
later that blood poisoning can lead to septic shock that has a death
rate exceeding 50%. I'm glad I didn't know it at the time, because
I'm susceptible to suggestion and probably would've died just to
please the statistician.</TE>
<TE>   I didn't die, but I think I was close. No, I didn't go floating
down a tunnel with a warm light at the end and my mother shaking her
finger and saying, "See, I told you so!" But, and this is the truth,
I did see John Travolta in the white suit he wore in "Saturday Night
Fever," striking the dance pose that adorned all the posters.</TE>
<TE>   I guess I was hallucinating due to the loosened synaptic
connections caused by the violent shaking, but why Travolta, with his
dewy grin and his cute little butt? Well, it was cute back then, I
guess, but I don't imagine it's that cute anymore. I'm not sure why I
saw him and not, say, Jessica Lange, who played the angel in "All
That Jazz," but I have no control over near-death experiences.</TE>
<TE>   I made Cinelli promise that if I should die, I didn't want her
trying to reach me through James Van Praagh, the guy on television
who claims to talk to the dead. Just watching his show could bore her
to death, and then we'd both be in the sweet beyond, arguing over
which cloud to occupy.</TE>
<TE>   I made it out of the hospital OK, where they took exceptionally
good care of me, even when I was getting well and demanding. The
nurses managed to smile no matter what, as though cosmetic surgery
had implanted smiles permanently on their faces as a condition of
obtaining nursing credentials.</TE>
<TE>   I've been home recovering for a couple of weeks, lounging around
in my silk pajamas like Hugh Hefner, except I didn't have any
centerfolds hanging all over me. I'm not sure I'm up to centerfolds
anyhow. But I did have you, writing and calling and e-mailing, saying
come back, old dog, come back to the city, with your growl and your
wagging tail and your funny ways.</TE>
<TE>   Yes. I've been away too long.</TE>

<LD>Helen and Jack Ofield were a bit flummoxed last Sunday morning when a
photographer asked them to pose with their chair. They'd owned and
used it regularly for the past three decades, but they no longer knew
whether they should even rest a hand on it.</LD>
<LD>   "It feels like we can't touch it anymore," Jack Ofield, a
filmmaker and professor at San Diego State University, whispered to
his wife as they stood just inside the entry to the main showroom of
Butterfields auction house in Hollywood.</LD>
<LD>   About an hour later this same secretary's chair--designed by Frank
Lloyd Wright in the late 1930s for his S.C. Johnson Administration
Building in Wisconsin--would fetch nearly $105,000 in less than a
minute, leaving the Ofields breathless and a crowd of serious buyers,
sellers and the simply curious cheering.</LD>
<TE>   Never mind that the chair was a bit worn and had an ink stain on
the seat. Never mind that because of its three-legged design it is
famous for tipping over. Never mind that it came to the Ofields as a
gift from the Johnson family after Ofield shot a TV documentary on
Wright's masterwork. As the auctioneer's gavel fell, the chair
dropped out of sight and into the hands of a private collector who
would not reveal his name. It turned from one family's prized
possession into another man's latest holding--perhaps equally prized,
but for different reasons. Because it's rare. Because it's considered
to be in great condition despite the nicks of time. And because
he--whoever he is--just had to have it.</TE>
<TE>   And so it goes in the ever-evolving world of collectibles, a world
with its own rhythms of letting go and coveting anew, of market rises
and falls, of competition for singular items and neglect for
yesterday's treasures.</TE>
<TE>   The Wright offering was the clear highlight of Sunday's auction of
nearly 450 lots of 20th century furniture, decorative arts and a
smattering of fine art that brought in nearly $1 million in about 5
1/2 hours in a blur of edge-of-the-seat highs and blink-of-an-eye
lows. It was a classic L.A. scene, with attendees demanding to remain
anonymous while dressed extravagantly in everything from cowboy hats
to chains, as likely to be sporting elaborate tattoos as diamonds.
About 250 people crowded into the darkened auction room adjacent to
the display galleries for the top-selling items--including the Wright
chair, a trio of 1911-13 mica-shaded copper lamps by the San
Francisco Arts and Crafts master Dirk van Erp, and a 1964 burl oak
"Conoid" table by George Nakashima. Dozens more bid absentee or by
Internet and phone. But even in the auction's quietest moments dozens
stayed in the room, ever ready to bid, or just to take notes in their
catalogs, for the record.</TE>
<TE>   Butterfields has been headquartered since 1865 in San Francisco,
where it conducts most of its sales. But because Peter Loughrey, the
company's 20th century decorative arts specialist, has a
long-established base here, and because so much material comes out of
L.A.'s trove of Modernist homes, Butterfields runs its modern
furnishings auctions at the Hollywood headquarters, an
undistinguished whitewashed warehouse at the somewhat dingy corner of
Sunset Boulevard and Curson Avenue, about a mile west of the new home
of the Academy Awards. It is a corner where auction goers might be
accosted in full daylight by neighborhood regulars--women with
fluorescent-red hair, 10-inch stilettos and shorts that barely
qualify as clothing. It is also a neighborhood where nearby homes
sell for millions and people often come in on a Sunday afternoon
willing to spend hundreds--or hundreds of thousands--in search of a
bargain.</TE>
<TE>   Butterfields may be best known for selling California plein-air
paintings, but it is increasingly becoming a place to buy more recent
works of all genres. In the past year the L.A. house has offered four
auctions in recent vintage design, recognizing a growing taste among
both young and older collectors and high- and low-end buyers. Works
by Tiffany and the Eameses regularly come up alongside the flickering
flames of various eras, such as the once-hot Italians known as the
Memphis Group. "There's our kitchen table growing up," said one
30-ish woman as she walked through the showroom on Sunday. "There's
Dad's office."</TE>
<TE>   As with any auction, the real business comes down to who's ready
to buy, and for how much. The mesmerizing voices of the auctioneers
invite bidders to go just one increment higher--raising the bids by
$10, "if you wish," for a commonplace item like an Eames walnut chair
that could easily be bought new for about the same $380 that it sold
for, used, on Sunday. Or, often enough, they ask buyers to go up
$5,000 more for, say, a rare Van Erp lamp.</TE>
<TE>   On Sunday, because of differences in style and condition, three
Van Erp lamps sold one after another for $104,750, $23,500 and
$14,100, as openers to the sale. The first was particularly
noteworthy for its size and style, known as "warty" because it has a
lumpy base.</TE>
<TE>   The auctioneers--on Sunday Loughrey split the duties with Ed
Beardsley--knock down their gavels about twice a minute, selling, in
this instance, someone's favorite sofa (Nakashima, $4,700), a prized
clock (George Nelson Spike Clock, $323) and a half-complete German
china set ($264).</TE>
<TE>   Every object has a story behind it, and the results of the sale,
with its highs and lows--top prices and buy-ins of things that don't
reach the seller's minimum "reserve" price--become a historical
marker, a public record of taste at the beginning of the 21st
century.</TE>
<TE>   Eight phone bidders were on the line when the Wright chair came up
just after 1 p.m. Loughrey had put a low-ball estimate on it of only
$12,000 to $15,000 in the catalog, but he'd since learned that rival
auction house Christie's had sold a chair of the same design in the
mid-1980s for $65,000, and he was hopeful for a much higher price.</TE>
<TE>   Although there are hundreds of examples of the same chair still
being used in the Johnson's Wax building, this is one of very few the
Johnsons have allowed to be removed. The Ofields got it as a gift
from Sam Johnson, grandson of the man who commissioned the architect.
Johnson sent the chair after Jack Ofield took special care in filming
Wright's streamlined, modern building in the mid-1970s. Since then,
the Ofields used it throughout their home--as a film editing chair in
Jack's studio, as a telephone table in their living space. It wasn't
very comfortable, Jack says, and indeed, legend has it the Johnson's
Wax secretaries once complained to Wright because they were falling
over in it if they weren't careful. "They'll only fall once," the
curmudgeonly architect is said to have replied.</TE>
<TE>   The chair opened at $10,000 with an absentee bid, and the price
rose quickly. Bryce Bannatyne, who runs a private design and
paintings gallery in Venice, stood at the back of the room, his
numbered paddle held high and unwavering. As the price rose by
$10,000 increments, one bidder after another dropped out. When
Loughrey hit $90,000 the room fell quiet, and he let the hammer fall.
The actual buyer--on the phone with Bannatyne--had his chair. Adding
in the standard, required buyer's premium, the buyer paid $104,750
for the chair, plus, presumably, a fee to Bannatyne for his advice.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a deal," Bannatyne said right after the sale, wearing a
large grin. His client, he said, plans to use the chair; he lives in
many residences, only one of which is in California, and in recent
years has been amassing a collection of major furniture he hopes to
exhibit someday. "It is a really important chair with a really great
provenance," Bannatyne said. "That makes it extremely rare."</TE>
<TE>   The Ofields were introduced to Bannatyne in the reception area and
seemed reassured that their chair would be cared for. "This is
historic preservation," Helen Ofield said, still looking stunned.
"Obviously it's going to someone who wants it."</TE>
<TE>   The rest of the afternoon was not nearly as dramatic--nearly a
quarter of the works didn't reach the seller's reserve price, and
will either be sold privately by Butterfields or returned to the
owners--yet the auction house counts the sale as a success. With the
low estimate for the total set at $808,780, Loughrey, exhausted and
still computing the overall meaning of the sale, reported that at the
final drop of the hammer at 5:30 p.m., the afternoon's take had
reached $926,580.</TE>
<TE>   It's a business of guessing, and even the experts are often wrong.
David Rago, owner of David Rago Auctions in Lambertville, N.J., and a
regular on PBS' "Antiques Roadshow," is among the best-known dealers
in Van Erp lamps; he set a record in May when he sold a large one for
$180,000. Speaking before the sale by phone from New Jersey, and
without seeing the Butterfields' offering, he predicted that the
"warty" lamp "shouldn't go for less than $100,000.... This is exactly
what they're looking for," he said.</TE>
<TE>   On the Wright chair, however, Rago's predictions weren't as on the
mark, demonstrating, as he admitted, that Wright is not his area of
expertise. "That's a cool chair," he said. "That chair might have
gotten $50,000 eight to 10 years ago, when the market for Wright was
up there. I'd be stunned if it brought more than $25,000 today."</TE>
<TE>   What doesn't sell sometimes is as interesting as what does. In a
conversation as the sale items were being installed in the galleries,
Loughrey pointed to a rusty low-lying metal container, 5 feet wide, 1
foot long and about 5 inches high, on rollers. It looked like
something the movers had left behind, nothing anyone would covet.
But, Loughrey pointed out, it was in fact a rare example of an indoor
planter box, designed in 1952 by Charles Eames. The catalog estimate
was $5,000 to $7,000, and when it was finally displayed in the
galleries, it did look spiffy--filled with pebbles and for the moment
supporting a Harry Bertoia sculpture, circa 1970. But despite its
pedigree and a clear provenance--it was custom made for the Malibu
residence of the late screenwriter-director Philip Dunne--the bidding
for it went nowhere, and it counted as a "pass."</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps just as interesting are the buyers. The same paddle
numbers are repeated over and over as the winning bidders, and often
those buyers are dealers planning to resell. Not always, however.</TE>
<TE>   Toward the end of the day, after successfully completing bids on
two tables--a dining table with a glass top and hefty sculptural base
by the mid-century New Hope, Pa., designer Paul Evans ($4,406) and a
coffee table in Evans' eccentric style ($763)--Gillian and Stephen
Foster left the salesroom to settle up. Gillian readily admitted that
she and her husband had never before encountered Evans' work, and
that they had made the purchase because "we buy what we like." Los
Angeles residents, they are buying "for personal use," she said, for
a location she didn't want to disclose. "We've bought quite a bit in
these last few days," she said; at the auction the couple also
purchased a black-leather 1970 American sofa ($6,462) and 10 Mies van
der Rohe armchairs with brown leather seats ($7,637). "We haven't
done much with auctions," she said, explaining that they usually buy
from galleries. "I feel badly bidding against dealers we buy from,
but this is a democracy," she said with a shrug.</TE>
<TE>   Some leave happy, others not so. Some a little of both. One of the
latter was a young man who asked to remain anonymous because he often
buys from private sales to sell at auction and doesn't want to be
known for that. A couple of his items did poorly early in the day,
and he was peevish, but a final consignment, in the final moments of
the sale, went for more than double the low estimate.</TE>
<TE>   He left smiling, his outlook radically revised by the luck of a
single bidder's insatiable desire.</TE>

<HD>A Sweets Success Story</HD>
<DH>Ralph Lauren's daughter makes a fashionable candy statement</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BOOTH MOORE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>With sugary pop songs on the stereo, a party room for rent, gummy
bear-shaped backpacks and jellybean-print dresses for sale, Dylan's
Candy Bar is more than a candy store; it's on the way to becoming a
candy lifestyle.</LD>
<LD>   Founder Dylan Lauren should know a thing or two about lifestyle
marketing. Her father is Ralph Lauren, the Brooklyn-born designer
who's outfitted the world in prep wear and homes with bedspreads,
bath towels and table accessories to match.</LD>
<LD>   Dylan could easily have gone into fashion, but her passion is
candy, which she approaches with the same artistic sensibility as her
father would a beaded gown.</LD>
<TE>   "I look at candy graphically and for the packaging," she says,
kicking her platform slides under a table at the store's ice cream
and coffee bar. Open nearly a year, the business has been so
successful, renovations were just completed to double the floor
space. Popular with adults and children alike, it has also become a
hot spot for Manhattan's private school kids to host birthday
parties.</TE>
<TE>   "Our goal is to take the best candies in the world and merchandise
them differently," says Dylan, who has collected interesting
confections since she was a kid (some of her favorite packaging is
from Japan).</TE>
<TE>   Located near Bloomingdale's on East 60th Street, the store is
Candy Land come to life, with fixtures that evoke the Pop Art
aesthetic of the sweet medium. Floor-to-ceiling columns are shaped
like peppermint sticks. The stairs leading down to the lower level
are translucent and filled with gumballs, gummy bears and other
treats.</TE>
<TE>   The centerpiece of the store's bulk candy-bin area is a giant
glass "candy" tree that projects colorful disks onto the ceiling that
look like lollipops. The tree is modeled after the work of artist
Dale Chihuly, says Dylan, who majored in art history at Duke
University.</TE>
<TE>   Then there's the edible stuff--bins of gummy bears in unusual
flavors such as passion fruit and pineapple, chocolate-covered cookie
dough nuggets, 5-pound lollipops, truffles packed in purse-shaped
boxes, mini-candy bars sculpturally arranged to look like birthday
cakes, solid chocolate baby shoes, tutti-frutti- and A&amp;W root
beer-flavored jelly beans, spin pops and Pez dispensers shaped like
Piglet, Mickey Mouse, Snoopy and Garfield.</TE>
<TE>   Though she's partial to divinity and Red Vines, it's impossible
for Dylan to pin down her favorite treat. There are just too many,
and every few months when she attends candy trade shows, she finds
more. Despite her insatiable sweet tooth, she manages to stay skinny
enough to fit into her dad's sveltest of denim skirts. "I work out a
lot," she says, running a hand through her long, brown curly hair.</TE>
<TE>   Before this venture, Dylan owned an event-planning company where
she often used candy for party centerpieces and on invitations. "It
was always my dream to do a Candy Land-themed party," she says.</TE>
<TE>   Through a mutual friend, she met Jeff Rubin, a veteran of the
candy business who in 1995 developed FAO Schweetz, the candy
departments inside FAO Schwartz toy stores. When the two discovered
they had the same idea of creating a sophisticated candy shop, they
decided to team up in a 50-50 partnership.</TE>
<TE>   "It's my job to go to every vendor and convince them that they
should do something special for Dylan's Candy Bar," Rubin says. So
far, he's persuaded Mars Inc. to make 16 original colors of M&amp;Ms and
Hershey Foods Corp. to produce 12 new hues of foil-wrapped Kisses,
and he's nudging Double Bubble to produce a shampoo that smells like
bubble gum. The store also features such non-edible merchandise as
chocolate-scented soap, "milkshake" bubble bath, Hawaiian shirts with
candy-wrap prints, plus an array of baby tees and totes decorated
with the store's colorful logo, which Dylan designed.</TE>
<TE>   Plans to expand to other cities, including San Francisco, Las
Vegas and L.A., are in the works. "I want to make this the Disneyland
of candy," Dylan says. Entrepreneurship runs in the family. Her
brother David started the now-defunct Swing magazine right out of
college, and Andrew, the oldest sibling, owns a film production
company.</TE>
<TE>   Even so, Dylan says her dad, who's not a candy person, was wary
when she first told him her idea. "He did test me. He said, 'Only
kids eat candy. How are you going to make money with this?' " she
remembers.</TE>
<TE>   No sooner has she finished talking about her famous father than a
black SUV pulls up outside the store. Out jumps Ralph, dressed in a
T-shirt and jeans. As he dashes inside, Dylan jumps up to greet him
with a bear hug. He has stopped by to pick up a gift from his
daughter--a fishbowl-size candy dish full of custom-made, navy blue
and white M&amp;Ms.</TE>
<TE>   What are the candies emblazoned with? Polo ponies, of course.</TE>

<HD>New-Aged to Perfection</HD>
<DH>Retro appliances provide all the comforts of an old home
with the conveniences of a modern one</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JANET EASTMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Some great minds have tried to deliver a reliable way to travel
through time. But where H.G. Wells and Mr. Peabody--the brainy
cartoon canine who invented the Wayback Machine--failed to bring
their ideas to reality, you can succeed by stepping into your
kitchen. Retro refrigerators, stoves, ovens, TVs and faucets are
creeping into well-outfitted homes faster than cableless neighbors
craving TV Land reruns.</LD>
<LD>   People who study consumer motivation--you know, appliance
manufacturers, market forecasters and grad students scrambling to
justify their sociology theses--spout several theories on our need
for nostalgia:</LD>
<LD>   * We think things were built better in the good old days. And
we're willing to spend more since we'll use them every day, and we
hope they'll boost our home's charm value when we sell it.</LD>
<TE>   * We like decorating with items that were popular when the house
was built. How else to explain hula-girl salt-and-pepper shakers in
postwar ranch tracts?</TE>
<TE>   * As fatigued fast trackers, we crave touchstones to simpler
times, when the fridge held frosty glass bottles of milk rather than
boxes of liquid soy with a shelf life longer than Cher's.</TE>
<TE>   * We find comfort in the pudgy shapes of the past. Rounded objects
are seen in nature more often than the hard edges of our work pods.
Another thought: In a brushed-aluminum world, old-school design is as
impossible to ignore as a refrigerator painted flamingo pink.</TE>
<TE>   Play It Cool</TE>
<TE>   The Northstar fridge by Elmira Stove Works has a new,
energy-efficient GE interior, but its standard flat top, sides and
doors have been replaced with curves made of molded ABS plastic,
fiberglass and steel. Fin-shaped handles and a logo plate reminiscent
of the chromed-up cars of the 1950s complete the illusion that this
"coolerator" was ripped out of a baby boomer's childhood home.</TE>
<TE>   There is a choice of eight exterior colors, from creamy buttercup
yellow to eye-rubbing candy red, or you can customize a color by
mixing DuPont's Imron 6000 automotive finishes. The 18-cubic-foot
fridge has four gallon-sized adjustable bins, glass shelving and an
ice maker. Pop in the pimento-cheese celery and cocktail wienies, and
you'll be ready to invite Ozzie and Harriet over.</TE>
<TE>   The refrigerator costs about $2,700 and takes six weeks to be
delivered. Contact Elmira at (800) 295-8498; www.el
mirastoveworks.com.</TE>
<TE>   Tune In</TE>
<TE>   While you're in the kitchen, catch reruns of Julia Child's "The
French Chef" on one of Brionvega's new-aged TVs. The Algol has
updated digital components inside a console designed by Marco Zanuso
and Richard Sapper in 1964. The space-saving, foot-wide portable has
a tilted, polycarbonate 9-inch screen, metallic handle and a plastic
case in sun orange, night black or moon gray.</TE>
<TE>   The Italian company also offers a reproduction of a transparent,
cube-shaped TV designed by Mario Bellini in 1969. The Cuboglass is 14
inches wide by 13 inches deep. Both color TVs (around $650 each)
transport you warp speed into the present with black matrix cathode
tubes for a sharp picture, broadband loudspeakers, video input,
headphones, and--don't panic--a remote control.</TE>
<TE>   For more information, visit www.brionvega.com. The TVs are sold
exclusively online at www.design -italia.it  (click "English
version").</TE>
<TE>   Toasting Yesteryear</TE>
<TE>   DeLonghi's counter-top convection toaster oven may have you
yearning for more of the Wonder Bread years. Its clunky, rounded body
with a polished chrome housing and mirrored door looks like an early
black-and-white TV. The enamel interior heats from 200 to 450 degrees
Fahrenheit, so you can warm your food, dehydrate it or cook it
somewhere in between. At 9 inches high, the oven, which costs $300,
fits most shelving. Call (800) 322-3848; www.de longhiusa.com.</TE>
<TE>   Ode to Grandma</TE>
<TE>   If the 1950s seem too complicated to you--after all, it was a time
when the Cold War and Cheez Whiz were topics of
conversation--consider taking your time machine back another century,
when Franklin wood-burning cookstoves warmed hearth and home.</TE>
<TE>   Several companies reproduce cast-iron stoves with nickel-plated
Queen Anne-style legs and ornamental brass plates. But Elmira Stove
Works of Ontario, Canada--yes, the '50s fridge people--tucks gas or
electric ovens where wood used to burn. Also hidden are exhaust fans
and oven controls. Burners are gas, electric or dual fuel. The Cook's
Delight stoves come in two widths, 30 or 45 inches, and start at
$3,545.</TE>
<TE>   Water Works</TE>
<TE>   If you want authenticity, get a bucket. If you appreciate the
convenience of water on tap, Delta Faucet Co. has a new line of
kitchen and bath faucets (starting at $228) that echo the curved
lines and bronze finish popular in Victorian times. The swivel spout
and base also come in chrome, stainless steel and a brass-and-chrome
combination. Handles are made of matching metal or porcelain. Call
(800) 345-3358; www.deltafaucet.com.</TE>

<HD>Old Times Recalled at End of New Times</HD>
<DH>With the alternative newspaper's closing, L.A. loses a
distinctive voice</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SCOTT TIMBERG</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Like everyone else--including, I'm told, the people who ran the
paper--I found out only Wednesday that New Times Los Angeles was
closing. New Times, where I worked for almost five years, was both
the most exciting job I've ever had and the most cruel. At its best,
the place had a Wild West openness and imagination. Through good
times and bad, though, I often thought an office shrink should be
part of the benefits package.</LD>
<LD>   My feelings for the paper, which I left this spring, are as mixed
as my experience there. The writers--and I was one for more than
three years--were given time and freedom to find their own stories,
often topics or points of view overlooked by the mainstream media,
and render them in depth. I'd like to think that our enthusiasm for
our stories--and there are few things more exciting than discovering
a scandal or a cultural movement that's under everyone else's
radar--gave an energy to the writing.</LD>
<LD>   New Times took an old-school, two-fisted approach to journalism,
with an underdog, speaking-truth-to-power attitude, as if "Citizen
Kane" had been remade by Sam Fuller. Whatever its alternative culture
window dressing and macho swagger, the paper was heir to some of
journalism's oldest and noblest impulses.</LD>
<TE>   My own position at New Times was tenuous and inexplicable: As the
only writer of arts cover stories, I felt like the guy in the frat
house who plays the violin. New Times was best known, I think, for
The Finger, the truculent, sometimes hilarious
inside-media-and-politics column, and Jill Stewart's contrarian
political column. My work, mostly on authors, film directors and pop
culture figures, didn't resemble these more celebrated features, and
I sometimes wondered if I was part of an affirmative action program
for liberal, Caucasian English majors (oddly, the exact type of which
most papers have no shortage). At times, I'll admit, I was encouraged
to bring a shrillness to my writing--I'd had dirty words removed from
my copy at straight papers, here they were occasionally inserted--but
I was mostly left alone.</TE>
<TE>   There were no focus groups, no political correctness and only
occasional interference from corporate bean counters. We got some
crazy orders sometimes--a zillion-part series on the mating habits of
the gray whale, a series that ran in its entirety in desert-dry
Phoenix--but we more than punched our weight. New Times prided itself
on investigative journalism, and The Finger was among those who broke
this paper's Staples Center scandal. A subversive sense of humor
found its way into some sublime April Fools issues, one of which
caused a small stampede by Hollywood types over an imaginary
indie-film "scene" run out of a Palmdale steakhouse.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   My experience at New Times may be stranger than most. I was hired
in 1997 as music editor from a small daily in New England. The day I
arrived, I found that I'd become the arts editor. The day after that,
I found that I was handling the entire chain's national film
coverage, working with such highly regarded critics as Peter Rainer,
Mike Sragow and Andy Klein. But I wasn't cut out for editing, and my
bosses and I knew it. At the end of my first year, I was called into
my boss' office and told I was being made a writer. The reassignment
delighted me, until editor Rick Barrs told me that I'd be doing this
writing at New Times' paper in Houston.</TE>
<TE>   I offered to stay in L.A., otherwise they'd have to fire me. A few
days later, Mike Lacey, the chain's self-made founder, called me at
home, asking me to reconsider. He'd heard that I'd turned him down
because of an L.A. girlfriend; he was so eager to have me in Houston,
he said, that he'd give me plane tickets back to L.A. for conjugal
visits. "A real testosterone-driven world view," said an old friend.
He fired me.</TE>
<TE>   Six months later, Lacey hired me back, this time with more money
and more vacation. With scary blue eyes, Lacey is a tough, sometimes
charming, occasionally brilliant Irishman who's impossible to fool.
He may be the most stubborn guy I've ever known, but no one can say
he couldn't admit mistakes. One day, after a writer's meeting, he
said "It's great to have you back." It seemed churlish to mention
that I'd been back, at this point, for two years.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   New Times, which could hit hard and true, also felt rudderless
sometimes. I saw a staffer all but disemboweled at a writers meeting
for penning too many stories about sex, only to hear a few months
later that Lacey had decided that sex and religion drove L.A.'s
culture and that all such stories were welcome.</TE>
<TE>   Though it paid my salary, it's hard to feel sorry for the
corporation. New Times bought, then killed two competing papers, the
Los Angeles Reader and the Village View, when it came to town in
1996, and this tends to be the corporation's style. In truth, the
corporate takeover of what used to be the underground press happened
a long time ago.</TE>
<TE>   What was most provocative about New Times was the possibility of
taking the irreverence, the iconoclasm of the alternative press, and
unshackling it from the cant of the left and the sacred cows of the
counterculture. Some of this came across in the L.A. paper, as it
comes across in the New York Observer, the Weekly Standard and a
number of London papers. New Times didn't hit it every time, but it
was aiming somewhere important.</TE>

<LD>NOWHERE MAN</LD>
<LD>   A Novel</LD>
<LD>   By Aleksandar Hemon</LD>
<TE>   Doubleday</TE>
<TE>   256 pages, $23.95</TE>
<TE>   Sarajevo-born writer Aleksandar Hemon's debut, "The Question of
Bruno," (2000) was widely praised by critics--even earning the author
comparisons to Vladimir Nabokov--and with good reason. Hemon's
stories, chronicling the immigrant experience, were satirical,
painful, absurd and wrenching; they were all the more remarkable for
having been written in English, a language the author had only
recently adopted. In his best moments, Hemon proved himself as
inventive a writer as Nabokov or Salman Rushdie. He seemed, in other
words, to possess the kind of bold talent that doesn't come around
very often. And in his follow-up book, Hemon again displays his
prodigious gifts--nearly every sentence of this novel is infused with
energy and wit.</TE>
<TE>   "Nowhere Man" reintroduces readers to Jozef Pronek, the hapless
protagonist of "Blind Jozef Pronek &amp; Dead Souls," from "The Question
of Bruno." Here Jozef's entire life is laid out in a scattered,
episodic fashion, related by unreliable narrators and skipping back
and forth in time.</TE>
<TE>   The novel begins in the early 1990s, with Jozef having immigrated
to Chicago from Sarajevo. But the first section focuses not on Jozef
but on one of the book's narrators, who applies for a job teaching at
the English as a second language institute where Jozef, whom he knew
as a boy, is a student. The unnamed narrator recounts his previous
menial jobs, which include working at the Art Institute of Chicago:
"My job there had been to unpack boxes of books, shelve the books,
and then smash the boxes and throw them away," he says. "Smashing the
boxes was my favorite part, the controlled, benign destruction." The
delights of "Nowhere Man" lie not in the story but in the minor
details and sharp observations throughout. The narrator sees a
cockroach scuttle behind the stove in his apartment and imagines "the
greasy warmth, the vales of dirt, the wires winding like roads. I
imagined getting there, still clutching a crumb of skin, after almost
being cut in half by something immense coming down on me." He watches
a proselytizer on a subway train, "with his hands folded over his
crotch," imploring passengers to " 'give your life to Jesus Christ
and follow him to the Kingdom of God.' "</TE>
<TE>   Jozef comes into focus in the book's second section: his birth
("his crumpled face, dominated by a screaming mouth, like an
Expressionist painting" ) and early years. The droll narrator breezes
through Jozef's "uneventful" infancy, which include the typical
"diaper-changing, sleeping, sucking, burping, and so on." Yet he does
highlight a few notable moments, such as when young Jozef "peed in a
perfect arc on an electric heater, discontinuing the stream just in
time not to get electrocuted."</TE>
<TE>   Jozef's boyhood years prove fumbling. He struggles to shed "the
stigma of cuteness" and his "round cheeks and girlish curls." As a
student, the narrator reveals that Jozef's sole distinguishing
quality was that "he never, ever volunteered to do anything." When he
leaves Sarajevo in 1992, he feels gripped by "abrupt sorrow" at the
airport and drags his suitcase "with its blocked hind wheels leaving
two trails behind, like the heels of a corpse."</TE>
<TE>   The novel's most engaging sections chart Jozef's low-level jobs in
Chicago, including his brief, harrowing experience working for a
private detective: When his potential boss asks if Jozef knows how to
"tail" someone, the perplexed job applicant responds by asking,
"Tale? You mean, tell the tale?" He is slightly more successful at
canvassing for Greenpeace, which also provides him with his first
fully developed romantic relationship, with a fellow worker named
Rachel. (Jozef's door-to-door fund-raising efforts in various Chicago
neighborhoods are hilarious.) Other sections get bogged down in
wayward reminiscences by the different narrators, such as one who
recalls his hopeless infatuation with Jozef, his former dormitory
roommate.</TE>
<TE>   To the author's credit, Jozef is portrayed with just enough
dignity and resolve to avoid seeming utterly pathetic. He is a true
oddball, yet we care about what happens to him.</TE>
<TE>   The events of Jozef's life tend toward the tragicomic, as when he
earnestly forms a Beatles cover band with his best friend, Mirza--but
he never seems to be simply a buffoon in the style of Nabokov's Pnin.
During his time in America, Jozef feels increasingly enraged at the
humiliations he has suffered, both in his homeland and in his adopted
country. His efforts to make a proper life for himself in America
seem destined to fail, and his anger comes out in irrational,
powerful bursts, leaving him feeling even more helpless in their
aftermath.</TE>
<TE>   One slightly frustrating aspect of "Nowhere Man"--the novel's
title comes from the Beatles song--is Hemon's tendency to indulge in
riffs that show off his linguistic dexterity. Though often brilliant,
such riffs prove distracting. However, perhaps they serve to
complicate our familiarity with the mysterious and isolated
protagonist, a true original.</TE>
<TE>   By the end, Jozef Pronek is still a "nowhere man" searching for an
identity.</TE>

<LD>An Italian Renaissance-style home in the Windsor Square-Hancock Park
section of Los Angeles renovated by more than 22 designers is open to
the public through Nov. 3 to benefit the Assistance League of
Southern California's charities. The 9,000-square-foot Design House
2002 was built in 1921 from plans by Charles F. Plummer. Tickets are
$20 and parking is available at the Los Angeles Scottish Rite Masonic
Temple, 4357 Wilshire Blvd. For more information, call (877)
482-3237; www.de signhousela.com.</LD>
<LD>   * Crate &amp; Barrel opens it first Los Angeles store featuring a
second floor devoted to furniture today in the Grove shopping center
in the Fairfax district. The line includes couches, tables, storage
units and beds. The company's in-house architects used skylights and
picture windows to set the stage for the furniture, which is arranged
in vignettes and grouped by style--classic, European country,
contemporary and cottage. The store is at 189 the Grove Drive. For
more information, call (323) 297-0370; www.crateandbar rel.com.</LD>
<TE>   * An exhibit of leaded-glass windows designed by Frank Lloyd
Wright opens Saturday at the Orange County Museum of Art. Many of the
50 decorative glass originals on display through Jan. 5 are from
private collections and have not been available for public viewing.
The architect used what he called "light screens," a nod to Japanese
shoji screens, when he needed to "cut holes" in his "beautiful
buildings." The museum is the only West Coast stop for the exhibit,
organized by Exhibitions International and the Frank Lloyd Wright
Foundation. Admission is $10. The museum is at 850 San Clemente
Drive, Newport Beach. For more information, call (949) 759-4848;
www.ocma.net.</TE>
<TE>   * The Sowden House, a private residence in Los Feliz designed by
Lloyd Wright and built in 1926 will be the site of a benefit dinner
on Saturday for the Los Angeles Conservancy. The eldest son of Frank
Lloyd Wright used steel-reinforced textured concrete blocks
throughout the house, most dramatically in the living room and master
bedroom. The blocks, along with a nearly windowless front facade,
create an inviting open-air central courtyard. Tickets cost $350 and
proceeds benefit the conservancy's educational and advocacy programs.
The house is at 5121 Franklin Ave. For more information, call (213)
623-2489; www.laconservancy.org.</TE>
<TE>   * Robinsons-May debuts its Lifestyle Store at Irvine Spectrum
Center on Wednesday. The 140,000-square-foot clothing and housewares
store has few interior walls and movable panels to easily adjust the
space for different promotions. The free-standing building is at 93
Fortune St., Irvine. For more information, call (949) 341-9111;
www.mayco.com.</TE>

<LD>America's Musical Quilt</LD>
<LD>   Most of our citizens came to the United States from other parts of
the world. With them, they brought the cultures and traditions of
their homelands. Music was an important part of these cultures.</LD>
<LD>   At first, people sang, played and danced to music from their own
countries. But soon, as they began to live and work with people from
other cultures, the music began to merge. Music from France and
Spain, for example, combined with rhythms from Africa and eventually
developed into ragtime. African rhythms combined with church hymns
and became blues and jazz. Eventually, American music became a
multicolored quilt made up of tunes and rhythms from around the
world. From this world of sounds, American composers created a new
language: American music.</LD>
<TE>   The most famous of these composers was Aaron Copland. One of his
pieces takes folk songs from an English religious sect known as the
Shakers and uses them to create the famous American ballet,
"Appalachian Spring." In "Three Latin-American Sketches" Copland
borrows rhythms and melodies of Mexico and combines them with his own
musical heritage to create a piece that reflects America.</TE>
<TE>   You can hear the two Copland tunes plus music from many parts of
the world Sunday when Symphony in the Glen presents "An American
Landscape." Children are invited to join the "Learning About the
Orchestra" workshop, beginning at 1:30 p.m., where they will be able
to hold and play various musical instruments guided by members of the
orchestra. The concert is free. Seating is picnic-style. Concertgoers
are encouraged to bring blankets. For more information, visit www.sym
phonyintheglen.org or call (213) 955-6976.</TE>

of Symphony in the Glen, which performs at Griffith Park, 4800
Carousel Drive, near the merry-go-round (follow park signs on entry).</TE>

are for younger kids than me (I am already 8 years old!). Last year I
thought the same thing, so I didn't wear a costume then either.
However, my sister, who is about 2 years old, is going to wear a
costume when we go trick-or-treating.</TE>

<LD>Archie looked at Martin and his little sister, Cora. One minute he
wished the farmhouse were big enough to take in both children. The
next minute he figured it might be a real hardship for the Wilkins
family.</LD>
<LD>   Meanwhile, some of the other children got tired standing on the
train platform. Two girls began turning cartwheels. A tall boy rolled
up his sleeves to show one family his muscles so its members would
see his strength.</LD>
<LD>   Then Archie saw that Cora was crying and pulling Martin's hand.</LD>
<TE>   "Don't cry, Cora," Martin told her. "Please don't cry."</TE>
<TE>   Archie remembered something in his pocket. He reached inside, took
it out, and leaped onto the platform.</TE>
<TE>   "Here, Cora," he said. "It's a little carved horse for you. I hope
you like it."</TE>
<TE>   Cora stopped crying. She looked at the horse and held it close.</TE>
<TE>   "That's real nice of you," Martin told Archie.</TE>
<TE>   "Nah, it's nothing," Archie said.</TE>
<TE>   When Archie turned around, Ma and Pa were standing there.</TE>
<TE>   Archie looked up at them and pleaded with his eyes.</TE>
<TE>   "We talked over the matter," Pa told Archie.</TE>
<TE>   Archie held his breath.</TE>
<TE>   "We want Martin Malone and little Cora to come home with us," Ma
said. "Pa will build a small bed for Cora. We'll all manage the best
we can."</TE>
<TE>   Archie felt his heart pound again. He was glad. It might not be
easy, but he knew the Wilkins family would make it work out.</TE>
<TE>   Pa turned to the two children. "Would you like to come with us?"
he asked. "The agent will give us the papers to sign."</TE>
<TE>   Archie waited for Martin and Cora to answer.</TE>

<LD>Elvis Presley is shaking up the pop world again.</LD>
<LD>   Twenty-five years after his death, rock's signature star entered
the nation's album chart at No. 1 on Wednesday with a hits collection
that sold 500,000 copies last week.</LD>
<LD>   The album, "Elvis: 30 #1 Hits," was patterned after the Beatles'
hugely successful "1" album, which has sold more than 8.4 million
copies since its release in 2000.</LD>
<TE>   Because in recent years Beatles retrospectives have tended to do
better on the charts than Presley's, the new RCA disc is off to an
impressive start because the Beatles' "1" only sold 595,000 copies in
its first week. But it's anybody's guess whether the Presley package
can match the continued sales momentum of the Beatles album.</TE>
<TE>   "This was a really, really handsome first week, and it suggests
the album is a contender to be one of the fourth quarter's big gift
items," said Geoff Mayfield, director of charts for Billboard
magazine.</TE>
<TE>   The album, which contains such classic hits as "Heartbreak Hotel"
and "Don't Be Cruel," ended a one-week stay at No. 1 by the rock
group Disturbed's "Believe," which fell to No. 4. It has sold more
than 402,000 copies in two weeks.</TE>
<TE>   It was a strong week for new releases, with five other artists
with new albums also entering the Top 10 last week: India.Arie (No.
6), Beck (No. 8), Peter Gabriel (No. 9) and Nas (No. 10).</TE>
<TE>   Another classic hits retrospective, the Rolling Stones' "Forty
Licks," was released Tuesday. It too is expected to do well.</TE>
<TE>   On the singles chart, "American Idol" winner Kelly Clarkson's
"Before Your Love" sold 146,000 copies last week to remain No. 1.</TE>

<HD>DJs Emerson, Deluxe to Help Open Stereo Club</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>It seems like every week there's a new dance club opening in L.A.,
but the arrival of a new spot with the backing of L.A. dance music
guru Jason Bentley and Gary Richards (who promotes the Sunday Pool
Party at the downtown Standard) is news. Bentley and Richards are
promoting Stereo, which will be held every Thursday night at the new
Ivar in Hollywood.</LD>
<LD>   The club celebrates its grand opening tonight with a four-hour DJ
set by Darren Emerson and Tim Deluxe. Producer-DJ Emerson is best
known for his work with the seminal electronic band Underworld, while
Deluxe is a remix whiz whose deft touches can be heard on some of
this year's biggest records--Kylie Minogue's "Can't Get You Out of My
Head" and Layo &amp; Bushwacka's "Love Story" among them. Together, the
pair has just released "Underwater: Episode 1," a two-CD compilation
that rejoices in the uplifting, body-gyrating sound of house music.</LD>
<LD>   In one of his last local appearances, Emerson was victimized by
poor turnout and lack of energy. However, tonight, spurred on by
partner Deluxe and the buzz of an opening night, Emerson should be in
prime form.</LD>

<TE>   The annual Carl Wilson Foundation benefit concerts, held in memory
of the Beach Boy singer and lead guitarist who died in 1998 of
cancer, are always emotional affairs, but especially so when big
brother Brian participates. The Beach Boys' musical architect is
aboard this year, and he'll be joined by his longtime collaborator,
songwriter-producer Van Dyke Parks, for a show Sunday at UCLA's Royce
Hall that gets extra marquee muscle from Eric Clapton and Sugar Ray.
The foundation was set up by Carl's two sons to support cancer
research and organizations that help those with cancer.</TE>

<HD>Extreme Situations</HD>
<DH>French director Claude Miller likes to see how people face
challenges. His new 'Alias Betty' involves kidnapping and blackmail.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SCARLET CHENG</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"People say my films are preoccupied with characters who are a bit
twisted," observes French director Claude Miller, whose psychological
drama "Alias Betty" opens Friday. "I do like to put people in extreme
situations, situations where they can't retreat to what they've
learned in the past. I think the upheavals in our lives are just
that, when we don't have references for dealing with what confronts
us."</LD>
<LD>   As a London Times writer once put it, Miller's "films are all
serpentine swarms of suppressed passions and festering fears."</LD>
<LD>   Sitting in a sun-dappled West Hollywood garden, Miller seems a man
of such steely mental balance that it is hard to imagine anything
tipping him asunder.</LD>
<TE>   Although he may be unfamiliar to American audiences, Miller, 60,
has directed 10 films and is respected enough in France that he
served on this year's Cannes Film Festival jury. He manages a steady
output of a film about every two years, with the help of his longtime
producer, Annie Miller, who is his wife.</TE>
<TE>   Yes, he says, he tosses his characters into upheavals, but that
simply makes for interesting film. In "Alias Betty," thirtysomething
Betty Fisher (Sandrine Kiberlain) finds herself the victim of
outrageous fortune. The successful novelist returns to France after a
bad marriage in the U.S. She moves into a beautiful house in a
respectable Paris arrondissement with her young son, the joy of her
life. But a visit from her difficult, demanding mother (Nicole
Garcia) disturbs their peace, then tragedy strikes. Betty soon finds
herself involved in kidnapping, blackmail and gangland machinations.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Not necessarily the kind of film you'd predict from Miller's youth
in Paris. "I adored all those old Hollywood films," he reports with
gusto. "Those cheap ones about the 1,001 nights, the 'Thief of
Baghdad.' I had very bad taste."</TE>
<TE>   He comes from what he calls "a modest background" in which it was
considered odd to work in the film world. "But throughout my
childhood," he says, "all I wanted to do was to tell stories with the
camera."</TE>
<TE>   After attending film school, Miller was hired as film assistant on
the productions of three legends of French cinema, Jean-Luc Godard,
Robert Bresson and Jacques Demy. Asked about his first jobs, he says,
"I brought the sandwiches and the coffee.... I was very happy to just
be there." Eventually, he made it to assistant director and
production manager.</TE>
<TE>   In the late 1960s, the apprentice found his favorite, and he
worked with Francois Truffaut on 10 films, from "Stolen Kisses"
(1968) to "The Story of Adele H" in 1975.</TE>
<TE>   In 1976 Miller directed his first feature, "The Best Way to Walk,"
about the tensions between two young workers at summer camp.</TE>
<TE>   Throughout, like every good auteur, Miller has chosen his projects
and kept a hand in the writing. "That's the French system; the
director is involved in the writing of the script," he says. "It
doesn't interest me to do it any other way." He has often adapted
from novels; "Alias Betty" is taken from a Ruth Rendell novel, "The
Tree of Hands," with the setting moved from England to France. (It
was made once before, not very successfully, by Giles Forster in
1988.)</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Miller likes to say that casting is 80% of the work, and he cast
Kiberlain before he wrote the screenplay. (Kiberlain has said that
she had wanted to work with Miller so much she accepted his offer
straightaway, without seeing a script.) Alexis Chatrian, the boy who
plays Jose, was found two weeks before shooting began.</TE>
<TE>   The director has been praised before for his work with child
actors, and he says he has a very different way of working with
children than with adults. He didn't try to discuss or explain the
plot to young Chatrian, however. "He's too young; he's only 4,"
Miller says. Instead, he got the reactions he wanted in a circuitous
manner. For example, in the scene in which Jose discovers a Christmas
tree in the house, his face lights up with happy surprise; Miller got
that look by having a magic trick performed for the boy off camera.</TE>
<TE>   Viewers will find Miller's film a far cry from the nouvelle vague
he was weaned on. Filled with fast cutting and snappy dialogue,
"Betty" is also punctuated with a zippy jazz score. "I'm very
obsessed with the problem of rhythm," he says. "For me, film is very
close to music." He keeps the rhythm up because "I'm afraid of boring
people."</TE>
<TE>   Even with such pacing, bringing a French film to the U.S. is a
hard sell, Miller concedes, but he likes to believe there's room for
more sophisticated fare in U.S. theaters.</TE>
<TE>   "I think that Hollywood films--not American films but specifically
Hollywood films--are becoming worse and worse," he says. "They're
made for teenagers, not for adults, and I think this creates a demand
in the public for other things. So that's a little opportunity for
us, to make films that aren't just for teenagers."</TE>

<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Pity the guests in third-floor pool-view rooms at the new Viceroy
hotel. At least pity the ones trying to get to sleep at a decent
hour. Since the hotel opened in mid-July at the corner of Pico
Boulevard and Ocean Avenue in Santa Monica, girls in skinny pants and
revealing tanks, and boys in jeans and sports jackets or polo shirts
have been turning out in droves. Just how hot is the Viceroy? On busy
weekend nights, there isn't just one beefy guy at the door but
several. How very Hollywood.</LD>
<LD>   Which brings up the main beef most people have with the hotel. If
you don't arrive early enough on Thursday, Friday or Saturday nights,
say, before 9:15, you risk not getting in. One guarantee of smooth
entry is to have dinner at the chic Whist restaurant, where the menu
ranges from lobster salad to honey coriander duck breast.</LD>
<LD>   Be sure to make a reservation, however. Another is to come on an
off night. A third is to wait till the panting fever of the new dies
down, but that could take awhile. The lobby lounge and expansive pool
area are super sexy. Credit Kelly Wearstler.</LD>
<TE>   Wearstler, a local designer perhaps best known for Beverly Hills'
Avalon and Maison 140 hotels, seems to be serving up what the kids
want: stylish comfort with a healthy dose of play. Architectural
Digest meets Martha Stewart meets Austin Powers.</TE>
<TE>   There are oversized, shiny white vinyl lounges inside and outside,
and fantastic green ceramic vessels straight out of "Aladdin,"
mirrored ceilings and walls covered with what look like Grandma's
blue and white china.</TE>
<TE>   The most groovy room of all might be the cozy study with its
wall-to-wall yellow shag carpet. Book titles ranging from "Funny
Cats" to "London Suburbs" to "Cheese" line the shelves. The twin
pools glow through the windows.</TE>
<TE>   Outside, it feels like a private pool party, although no one's
swimming. "It's very civilized," said Dan Winthrop, who was sharing
one of those lounges with his friend Lisa Kahn on a recent Friday
night. The 40-year-old owner of a film post-production company had
walked over from his nearby apartment, arriving shortly after 10.
"They said it's too full," he explained. "But I managed to find a way
in."</TE>
<TE>   Not surprisingly, most of the crowd is from the Westside. This is
in keeping with the typical after-dark migratory patterns of
Angelenos: Westsiders will go east but Eastsiders typically don't go
west.</TE>
<TE>   "There aren't that many cool spots on the Westside," offered Jeff
Jacobsen, a 28-year-old Santa Monica resident. "And there's
definitely nothing like this on the Westside."</TE>
<TE>   "It's probably a slightly lower-key version of the SkyBar," said
Tom Rubin, between sips of an $11.50 gimlet. "But I've never been to
the SkyBar."</TE>
<TE>   "It's an attractive crowd," added the 34-year-old lawyer. "But not
overly friendly. There's a lot of attitude here: less attitude than
at other places, but it's here. Despite everything," said Rubin, "I'm
having fun."</TE>
<TE>   Score one for the Santa Monica team.</TE>

<HD>Jazzed-Up Barbecue</HD>
<DH>The Barbeque Club Bar &amp; Grill serves dishes with real
Cajun-Creole roots as well as, surprise, live music on the weekends.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHARLES PERRY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Up till now, Southern barbecue has been in short supply up north.
Once you got beyond the San Fernando Valley, barbecue decor has
tended to run to horseshoes and branding irons. At one Santa Clarita
Valley place, the 'cue looks like fajitas. Another advertises itself
as the home of mesquite-baked pizza.</LD>
<LD>   But Santa Clarita's stunning growth--if you haven't been in the
area in five years, you may not recognize a thing--has made room for
the Barbeque Club Bar &amp; Grill, which opened a few months back in a
winding strip mall at Bouquet Canyon and Soledad Canyon roads.</LD>
<LD>   Instead of having cowboy gear on its walls, it has signed photos
of jazz musicians. The Barbeque Club even has live jazz after 9 p.m.
on Fridays and Saturdays, making it the only jazz supper club in
Santa Clarita. You have to make a reservation for the jazz show,
which is code-named Lucky 50.</LD>
<TE>   The club has high ambitions for a plain little place in a strip
mall. When you order a plate of ribs, you find the rim stylishly
sprinkled with herbs and pepper strips, California cuisine fashion.
The menu prose is rather addicted to the phrases "piping hot" and "to
perfection."</TE>
<TE>   But the place has real roots, and they're in Louisiana. The menu,
headed "Cajun/Creole cuisine and Louisiana-style BBQ," is about half
seafood and includes a couple of blackened dishes. One of the side
dishes of the day is likely to be rice mixed with Creole gravy, a
spicy, savory Louisiana roux. Some nights there's an special entree
of jambalaya, which is pretty much the same rice and roux mixture,
only a huge plate of it, mixed with chicken and bits of mild link
sausage, and topped with three grilled shrimp.</TE>
<TE>   The best appetizers are the fresh-tasting catfish nuggets, floured
and perfectly fried. They come with a Cajun ranch dressing punched up
with hot sauce and oregano, and so do the much richer bacon-wrapped
shrimp. The club's crab cakes have a very crunchy breading and come
with a tarragon mustard sauce, though they're pretty mushy inside.</TE>
<TE>   It may be surprising to see fettuccine on this menu, but people do
eat a lot of Italian food in New Orleans. It's tossed with a
judiciously spicy Alfredo sauce and a choice of vegetables, chicken,
shrimp or crayfish (you get plenty of crayfish).</TE>
<TE>   Although the menu says the barbecuing is done on green mesquite,
the smoke flavor is not particularly strong. The best barbecue item
is the meaty, tender baby back ribs (dinner only--spare ribs are
available all day, but they're a little chewy in places). The
barbecued chicken is also very good, moist and tender.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, all the smoked meats are good except the sliced beef,
which can be chewy, and I have to warn that the beef hot links are
not particularly hot.</TE>
<TE>   You can get any three smoked meats on a combo platter.</TE>
<TE>   Various other items are cooked on a grill, rather than in a
barbecue pit: pork chops, pork loin (cut in thin strips), catfish and
marinated red snapper. Like the smoked meats, they come with a dark,
sweet barbecue sauce of the KC Masterpiece school.</TE>
<TE>   Beef, chicken and link sandwiches are available, all with the same
barbecue sauce. Shrimp or catfish po' boys, though, use the same
wonderful Creole ranch dressing that comes with the catfish nuggets.</TE>
<TE>   This place makes good fried chicken, but it's fried to order, so
add at least 20 minutes for your order. It's something to bear in
mind if the rest of your party is having fettuccine.</TE>
<TE>   A blackboard menu lists the side dishes of the day. The mixed
vegetables seem to be frozen succotash, but the others are all pretty
good. There are tangy collard greens, a potato salad with a lot of
chopped hard-boiled eggs in it, black-eyed peas (with some chopped
link sausage) on rice, very sweet barbecue beans and very sweet yams.</TE>
<TE>   For dessert, there's apple or peach cobbler, but the best choice
is sweet potato pie, like pumpkin pie with a less stringy texture and
a richer flavor.</TE>
<TE>   The Santa Clarita Valley may not have noticed it yet, but it now
has a jazzed-up Southern option.</TE>

<LD>That is not his hair. The man called Ratchet is alone on stage for a
moment, indulging in the mindless bliss and ego of a heavy metal
guitar solo. The wig on his head looks like roadkill, long and
frazzled and soaked in hairspray, but the leopard scarf across his
forehead at least matches his spandex tights.</LD>
<LD>   The song title hardly matters by now, as his solo erupts in all
directions, fast and shrill, intentionally ridiculous with moments of
"Popeye the Sailor Man" and "Smoke on the Water" dropped in with
equal weight. It's all about to peak when Ratchet abruptly stops to
pick his nose.</LD>
<LD>   When it's over, Ratchet (a.k.a. Russ Parrish) steps up to the
microphone, his grinning head bobbing up and down, absolutely certain
of his own greatness, to declare, "That was awesome, dude! Give it up
for the lead guitarist!"</LD>
<TE>   This is a typical Monday night at the Viper Room, where a band
called Metal Shop headlines a weekly attempt to revive, not revile, a
spectacular time in local rock history, when heavy metal dudes in
makeup and big, big hair ruled the Sunset Strip. Some fans come for
the comedy or to witness a frivolous era they are too young to
remember. Others aim to relive a youth of booze and noise and
hedonistic sex, still looking the part in rocker threads or vintage
T-shirts, even if all that long hair is a faded memory.</TE>
<TE>   That scene never ended for some headbangers. So even as the metal
'80s return at the Viper Room as a source of comedy and volume, some
fans and players are still living it from the first time around,
confident of its return to dominance. It's as if grunge and the
post-hip-hop nu-metal of Korn and System of a Down never happened.</TE>
<TE>   Metal quickly reinvented itself (again) in '90s, finding vital
inspiration in the darker, thrashier sounds of the Southern
California acts Slayer and Metallica, the latter of which escaped to
San Francisco in 1983 to build an empire of platinum albums and arena
tours. And now, after a decade of internal collapse and
still-unreleased recordings, Guns N' Roses is slowly returning to
action.</TE>
<TE>   The hair metal revival (both ironic and un-ironic) exists outside
that world, though it still resides in the same Los Angeles basin
where it was born. It can be found in small rooms like Paladino's in
Tarzana or at the Key Club in West Hollywood, where Club Vodka and
Gazzarri's Night (with its traditional wet T-shirt contest) embrace
the noise. Cinderella and other '80s acts frequently reemerge for
die-hards at the House of Blues. And the occasional package tour of
such reunited metal gods as Poison or Warrant delivers the old hits
in the big rooms.</TE>
<TE>   "It was so much fun," says Tara Roreen, a fan from the old scene
who's now a Tarzana computer analyst in her mid-30s and, at the
moment, handing out band fliers outside Paladino's. "It was before
HIV and before we became aware, and sometimes it's nice for even five
minutes to remember that stupidity and freedom that we had."</TE>
<TE>   The most vibrant corner of this revival is still the Viper Room's
Monday-night Camaro club, where Metal Shop regularly shares the stage
with rockers from across the generations. Members of Weezer, Papa
Roach and 311 are regulars. One week, the visiting members of
Cinderella laughed so hard that guitarist Jeff Labar forgot his own
solo. ("They're making fun of me!") Aerosmith's Steven Tyler and Paul
Stanley of KISS have also appeared, embracing the comedy while
celebrating the flamboyant hard rock tradition they helped create.</TE>
<TE>   Soon after Ratchet's epic solo, the stage is crowded again, with
ex-Guns N' Roses bassist Duff McKagan and guitarist Tracii Guns and
singer Phil Lewis of L.A. Guns joining the clowns of Metal Shop to
tap their shared histories on the Strip. Lewis leans into a
microphone and sneers an old Guns tune, "Hey, little girl, you're a
nasty little sleazer.... We were close and getting so much closer!"</TE>
<TE>   McKagan stumbles amiably from one microphone to the other, his
famous platinum hair now dyed a deep black. But it's not all joking
here tonight.</TE>
<TE>   And there is a noticeable shift in the air as Tracii Guns erupts
with the springy riff from Van Halen's "Ain't Talkin' Bout Love,"
that 1978 epic of decadence and swagger, and a key influence on much
of the metal that came after.</TE>
<TE>   Suddenly, Metal Shop singer Michael Diamond (a.k.a. Ralph Saenz)
becomes Diamond Dave, drawing on his years fronting the Atomic Punks,
a popular Van Halen tribute band. The dim-bulb expression leaves his
face as he adopts David Lee Roth's signature moves, his chest out,
delivering shoulder-high karate kicks. This is no longer for laughs
or nostalgia. This is being played for real.</TE>
<TE>   Fans send fists and devil's horns high into the air, maybe without
noticing that a line between parody and sincere metal pomp has been
crossed, or probably not caring.</TE>
<TE>   The Viper Room's metal rewind began more than two years ago, when
co-owner Sal Jenco brought in Metal Shop, a parody from the same crew
behind the popular disco tribute the Boogie Knights. "It started out
as, I'm going to create an environment that embodies the worst of the
'80s: spandex, zebra prints, wet T-shirt contests, pentagrams, 'Hail
Satan,' metal," Jenco says, reclining in his office with a cigarette.
"I just had a feeling: this is funny."</TE>
<TE>   It was initially designed for a lesbian night at the club, with a
chain-link fence guarding the stage. Crowds came. And somehow '80s
metal was back.</TE>
<TE>   "We all know you can't put your arm around a memory," says Jenco,
quoting an old Johnny Thunders Heartbreakers song, an original punk
and metal influence, "but with a little smoke and mirrors, you get
close enough to it."</TE>
<TE>   The host is Josh Richman, an actor and onetime regular at the
Cathouse, the infamous '80s metal club in Hollywood. Tonight he
carries a cane with an eight ball handle and repeatedly calls Camaro
"the best rock club in the country." Much of which can be credited
not only to Metal Shop, but also to the contemporary acts brought in
to open the show by talent booker Dale Gloria, former impresario of
the Scream club.</TE>
<TE>   "Metal Shop will play a song by a quintessential '80s metal band,
and the singer of one of those bands will be here with 100 chins and
get up there, and Michael Diamond will sing the guy under the table,"
Richman says. "But nobody gets bummed."</TE>
<TE>   Back in February, one of the opening bands was Hand of Doom, a
straight-faced Black Sabbath tribute act led by Melissa Auf der Maur,
formerly of Hole and Smashing Pumpkins, an unlikely female stand-in
for Ozzy Osbourne. She prefers the darker '70s hard-rock psychedelia
of Sabbath or Led Zeppelin, with "the masculine and feminine coming
together," and the images of warrior kings and misty mountaintops.</TE>
<TE>   Hand of Doom just released a live album of Sabbath songs recorded
at the Whisky. But Auf der Maur's taste for '80s metal stretches no
further than the copy of Motley Crue's "Shout at the Devil" she owned
as a teenager. "The '80s thing? No thank you."</TE>
<TE>   But last year she recorded a version of Poison's anthem-like power
ballad "Every Rose Has Its Thorn" for a movie project by the makers
of "Mr. Show."</TE>
<TE>   Dave Grohl of Foo Fighters and Nirvana joined her on drums and
guitar. "I did a really authentic, caring version of it," she says
now. "It was fun to sing, and it was actually a pretty good song. I
hated it at the time."</TE>
<TE>   They are older now, deep into their 20s and 30s. The hair is short
or hardly there at all. They'd traveled from far away for a communion
with '80s metal heroes Dokken, Ratt, L.A. Guns, Firehouse and more.
What they find instead is a locked gate, a couple of security guys on
folding chairs and a marquee that reads: "Hollywood Palladium
Welcomes Rock Fest Canceled."</TE>
<TE>   They stare in disbelief and anger: the third-grade teacher from
Oakland, the insurance man from Albany, N.Y., the guy who flew in
from Honolulu, the Kansas City, Kan., trucker who made sure he was in
Hollywood, and that trio of Sacramento brothers blasting a Ratt CD in
their stretch limo.</TE>
<TE>   The scattered fans who arrive through the night are told the show
was canceled after Dokken's drummer was hurt in a car accident.</TE>
<TE>   "Hey, they canceled, bro!" Chris King says, talking into his cell
phone. He's a 26-year-old rock musician from Hancock Park, dressed in
baggy jeans, with a small cross over his throat. On the line is a
friend who was to meet him at the Palladium after October's Oscar De
La Hoya-Fernando Vargas fight. "Negative! Negative! Ratt canceled,
man!"</TE>
<TE>   Back in the '80s, metal fans and wannabe rock stars crowded the
Sunset Strip, from Gazzarri's all the way east to the Coconut
Teaszer. Poison, Guns N' Roses, Motley Crue, and a thousand anonymous
bands that never went anywhere, were all there on the Strip handing
out fliers for their next gig before ending the night over pizza and
booze at the Rainbow with some local artist and repertoire man.</TE>
<TE>   Hair metal soon dominated the charts and airwaves. Right up until
the moment Nirvana erupted from the underground in 1991, taking the
indie rock ethos to the masses. No makeup required. And metal was
never the same again; within a few years it was already the subject
of nostalgia, with still-young rockers wondering where all the good
times went. Especially that night at the Palladium.</TE>
<TE>   "I told my boss, I don't miss Ozzy and I don't miss a hair band,"
says the trucker, Charles Velasquez, 27. His own hair is cut close to
the scalp.</TE>
<TE>   "All I ever go to is hair bands. Except for country. I've never
been to a '90s band."</TE>
<TE>   Metal shows on the scale promised by the Palladium show are hard
to find, although Poison has found success and big crowds playing
nostalgia tours. Nathan Kahn, 29, wanted a bit more of that and had
flown down from Oakland.</TE>
<TE>   "I grew up on metal and I heard of all the nostalgia around metal
rock shows, and I wanted to rekindle the flame," says Kahn, sipping a
beer outside the locked gate. He'd been ready to party in the parking
lot. "Call me cheesy; call me an idiot, dude."</TE>
<TE>   "Oh, what a crowd we got here tonight!" the singer declares from
the stage at Paladino's, a busy nightclub anchoring a Tarzana
mini-mall. (Motto: "Rockin' the Valley!") "How many people here love
Bon Jovi? We're going to take you way, way back now!"</TE>
<TE>   Slippery When Wet is a Bon Jovi cover band. It's not as pretty as
the real thing, but the singer at least looks the part in a fringe
leather jacket, thick wavy hair down to his shoulders and a fine
approximation of Jon Bon Jovi's giddy, open-mouth grin.</TE>
<TE>   He leans toward the women crowding the stage, his black velvet
shirt open to his belt. The room is far from full, but the chicks are
singing along like teenagers, dancing with their drinks to the
anthem-like "You Give Love a Bad Name."</TE>
<TE>   At one nearby table, a hipster in earplugs and a porkpie hat isn't
watching the band at all. His eyes are on the ladies, especially a
small bachelorette party of women slow-dancing with a man-size blowup
doll, "Boy Toy" scrawled onto its chest, after a long night of beers
and shots.</TE>
<TE>   Keeping the hair-band dream alive for this grateful audience is
Jimmy D., talent booker at Paladino's. Most nights here are a mix of
'80s-style metal acts and pious tribute bands. "I saw a market for it
because the Valley is full of mullet heads and longhairs," he says.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, Foo Fighters drummer Taylor Hawkins became a regular
customer, threatening to start a tribute band of his own. Which
ultimately led to a surprise gig here by the Foo Fighters themselves,
as opening act for the Atomic Punks.</TE>
<TE>   Survivors from the original scene also come to the club, Jimmy D.
says, but he's hungry for new talent to feed the metal scene. "I
don't think the older bands are going to bring it back," he says.
"Those guys couldn't write a good song if their lives depended on it.
Also, the scene went with the looks of the band, and most of them are
either bald or overweight."</TE>
<TE>   No booze, no show. A tough break for Steve Summers, manager of
Gotham City, a topless bar and sometime rock club in Canoga Park.
Which explains the handwritten "Concert canceled" sign at the door.</TE>
<TE>   Summers is also the singer of Pretty Boy Floyd, a veteran
glam-metal act scheduled to make its fifth appearance here in as many
months.</TE>
<TE>   Two hours ago, city building inspectors announced that Gotham City
didn't have the proper permits to present live music and also serve
drinks in the back room, interrupting Summers' dream of continuing
the long tradition of mingling hard rock with naked women, metal with
porn. No booze, no show.</TE>
<TE>   "Tonight the city tried to mess with us," Summers says with a
shrug, as the night's scheduled bands pack up their equipment. "Stuff
happens."</TE>
<TE>   Beside his desk is his own gear--the leather pants, chains,
platform shoes, makeup. The walls are lined with purplish carpeting.
Cases of Bud sit by the door.</TE>
<TE>   Right outside his office the real work is being done, as young
women take turns at the brass fire pole, unpeeling their bikini tops
to the romantic sounds of Rob Zombie or Van Halen's "Hot for
Teacher." A rerun of "Frasier" unfolds silently on a TV above the
bar.</TE>
<TE>   The promised concert at least drew a larger crowd, with longhairs
and glam rockers mingling with the regulars. Leaning against the ATM
machine is a member of the night's opening band, the Peppermint
Creeps, in white pancake makeup and an X drawn on his forehead,
Manson Family-style. He's staring balefully at the stage beneath the
disco ball.</TE>
<TE>   Summers doesn't miss the old scene that launched Pretty Boy Floyd
and has few expectations to match those when MCA Records signed his
band a decade ago. He sits at his desk, where a small TV is connected
to black-and-white surveillance cameras. "We're all young," he says.
"We're getting offers for deals, not that we could be
multimillionaires. On the road, we sell merchandise and we don't do
too bad. And no one's disappointed by what we do."</TE>
<TE>   Quiet Riot never played Gazzarri's. And yet it's fitting that the
band has come for one night to the Key Club, built right above the
old burial grounds of Bill Gazzarri's defunct metal warehouse, where
Van Halen and Guns N' Roses played some of their earliest shows on
the Strip.</TE>
<TE>   Quiet Riot is still part of that history. It joined Ratt and
Motley Crue in the first wave of '80s metal to hit the masses, thanks
largely to MTV. Back in 1983, the band's "Metal Health" album hit No.
1 on Billboard's Top 200, becoming the highest-charting debut ever
for an American metal act. The band's good times ended long before
that decade was over, but tonight Quiet Riot can still fill a room
with true believers.</TE>
<TE>   "We played songs for you to sing along to in your car on a hot
summer day," singer Kevin DuBrow says from the stage. He looks fit
and essentially unchanged in his snug velvet pants, stringy black
curls rolling over his shoulders.</TE>
<TE>   Marshall amps are stacked high on the stage, and the band's hit
version of Slade's "Cum On Feel the Noize" has the singer twirling a
big striped microphone stand over his head, as if he were still
playing arenas.</TE>
<TE>   The songs are simple rock anthems, just thick chords of basic
metal, with hyperactive noodling at the edges.</TE>
<TE>   But near the close of 90 minutes on stage, Quiet Riot rips through
a surprisingly faithful take on the Who's "My Generation," which
leads to the inevitable lyric: "Hope I die before I get old!"</TE>
<TE>   The song is a classic and a curse on every generation of rockers.
But age is not an issue for DuBrow tonight. His band is making its
old-school metal, at once timeless and hopelessly dated, without
compromise or hesitation.</TE>
<TE>   For Quiet Riot and its fans, an '80s metal revival hardly seems
necessary.</TE>

<HD>You Want Some Metal; Where Do You Go?</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Steve Appleford</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A few places you can catch the metal craze and what you'll find
there:</LD>
<LD>   Viper Room</LD>
<LD>   The ghost of hair metal past arises every Monday night at the
Viper Room, where the Camaro club hosts the '80s parody Metal Shop.
Young hard-rock acts open the show, and celebrity guests (Steven
Tyler, Meat Loaf, etc.) typically join the headliners for a song or
more. In the DJ booth, Taime Downe, the moonlighting singer of Faster
Pussycat, spins a charged rock 'n' roll song list that stretches from
T. Rex to Guns N' Roses to Queens of the Stone Age. 8852 Sunset
Blvd., West Hollywood, (310) 358-1880.</LD>
<TE>   Key Club</TE>
<TE>   The past is present several times a month at the Key Club, where
'80s metal vets gather for the nostalgic crowds of Club Vodka and
Gazzarri's Night, often mixing music with bikini pageants or wet
T-shirt contests. Feel the noize. 9039 Sunset Blvd., West Hollywood,
(310) 274-5800. Tonight: Club Vodka, with Faster Pussycat, Chigger
Red, Peppermint Creeps. Oct. 29: L.A. Guns. Nov. 7: Gazzarri's Night,
with Y&amp;T, Little Caesar.</TE>
<TE>   Paladino's</TE>
<TE>   Metal may have ruled the '80s Sunset Strip, but the San Fernando
Valley was the home for many would-be rockers as well; key metal
venues included the Country Club and FM Station. So it's fitting that
this Valley nightclub shows unmatched dedication with a calendar
dominated by '80s-style metal and hard rock tribute bands. 6101
Reseda Blvd., Tarzana, (818) 342-1563. Friday: Metal Sludge
Extravaganza 5, with Metal Shop, Motley Priest, Handsome Devil, more.
Oct. 11: Atomic Punks (a tribute to early Van Halen). Oct. 12: Iron
Maidens (an all-female tribute to Iron Maiden).</TE>
<TE>   The Rainbow Bar &amp; Grill</TE>
<TE>   No live music, but this restaurant-bar-hangout has been home to
several generations of rockers in search of pizza and booze to end
(or begin) a long night on the Strip. Lemmy Kilmister of Motorhead is
still a regular. "The Rainbow was like the bacchanal of bad taste,
which I say with love and respect," journalist Lonn Friend, longtime
editor of R.I.P. magazine, says of the club. "Now contemporary
artists hobnob at the Rainbow. And after midnight it is a time warp,
much like Metal Shop is." 9015 W. Sunset Blvd., West Hollywood, (310)
278-4232</TE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Ballona Fish Market ahoy, mates! A new seafood restaurant has just
sailed into Marina del Rey Marketplace. Rock, a spinoff of the Santa
Monica restaurant Rockenwagner, floundered there, but rather than
give up the space, chef Hans Rockenwagner changed the name and the
concept. Gone is the casual eclectic menu that mingled California
tastes with French, Italian, German and Korean. In its place: Ballona
Fish Market, named for the nearby Ballona Wetlands.</LD>
<LD>   Rockenwagner, a skilled woodworker, took up his hammer and saw to
give the place the look of a New England seaside resort. He clad the
building in white clapboard siding and added a jaunty blue awning out
front. Inside, he built a pair of diminutive seaside cottages that do
double duty as private dining rooms. Photos of friends and family at
the beach populate the walls. This time around, he seems to have
tamed the noise level, too, which is a big plus. Ballona's chef is
Frank Springmann, who comes to town from Seattle's Flying Fish
restaurant. Although the setting is strictly suburban and the closest
beach a five-minute drive away, that salt tang in the air is enough
to make anybody hungry for fish.</LD>
<TE>   For starters, there's a fine hand-chopped ahi tuna tartare with
pickled onions and baby arugula served with a dark crispbread. A
thick soup of figs and pears scribbled with creme fraiche and lighted
up with chile is harder to fathom. Spring rolls filled with salmon
smoked on the premises get an oddball dipping sauce of white
asparagus "jam." And there's a delightful tomato tarte tatin wearing
a cloud of blue cheese mousse.</TE>
<TE>   Although fish--opah with Mission fig compote; grilled albacore
with spinach, pine nuts and raisins; grilled king salmon with lemon
thyme sauce--is the star of the menu, Springmann can just as easily
get into cooking buttermilk fried chicken with mashed potatoes and
green beans or a fine pretzel burger--a burger served on a pretzel
bun, which is something of a signature dish at Rockenwagner.</TE>
<TE>   Occasionally, the kitchen gets carried away and tries to fit too
many competing flavors into one dish. A beautiful piece of wild
striped bass, for example, almost disappears under the onslaught of a
sharp eggplant caviar, basil sauce and smashed Peruvian blue
potatoes. Desserts could use some tweaking, and the wine list is a
bit cautious.</TE>
<TE>   Ballona is still a work in progress. That said, I can't imagine
Rockenwagner putting away his toolbox and his knife roll yet--not
until he's got Ballona Fish Market just the way he wants it.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>

<HD>Polly Bergen Pours Voice, Heart Into Songs</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID C. NICHOLS</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>For decades, up until around the dawning of the Age of Aquarius,
Manhattan's nightclub scene reigned as the epitome of romantic
sophistication. That golden era is alive and kicking in Costa Mesa,
where Polly Bergen's magnificent cabaret turn is galvanizing the
Orange County Performing Arts Center through Saturday.</LD>
<LD>   The ambience is intimate, with Founders Hall reconfigured into a
roomful of tables and chairs. The superb accompaniment of Joseph
Thalken (piano) and Jered Egan (bass) heralds the star attraction.
From her first offstage bars of Jerry Herman's "It's Today" from
"Mame" to her dove-toned encore of "The Party's Over" (her signature
recording hit), it's magic time.</LD>
<LD>   Few performers of her generation can have vaulted time as
successfully as Bergen has. Ineffably elegant in basic black, she
appears possibly old enough to have mothered a teenager or two, but
grandchildren? Well, if Bergen says so, I must believe her.</LD>
<TE>   Such is the pull of her irresistible personality. Although Bergen
has been up one side of show business and down the other, on stage
she is unpretentious, with a rich sense of humor and a palpable love
of what she is doing.</TE>
<TE>   What she is doing is singing her heart out in an airtight
70-minute set that ends much too quickly. Under Richard
Jay-Alexander's shrewd direction, Bergen's program sports engaging
conversation between numbers. She recalls how losing the role of Ruth
Etting in "Love Me or Leave Me" to Doris Day led to her Emmy-winning
television performance in "The Helen Morgan Story."</TE>
<TE>   Perched on the piano, she pours open-throated emotion into "Why
Was I Born?" and "Bill," and it's 1957 all over again.</TE>
<TE>   Time's effect on Bergen's chops is negligible, and she has
developed a force approaching Judy Garland levels and an interpretive
depth worthy of Mabel Mercer. Janis Ian's "Stars" has the power of an
elegiac one-act play, while Kander and Ebb's "So What?" from
"Cabaret" raises goose bumps.</TE>
<TE>   She has a comic field day with "He Ain't Mr. Right (But He's Mr.
Right Now)," borrowed from Broadway's Sally Mayes, one of Bergen's
many gracious acknowledgments throughout. Her syncopated take on
Stephen Sondheim's "The Ladies Who Lunch" from "Company" is stunning,
a potent alternative to Elaine Stritch's iconic original. Bergen
follows this with a definitive reading of "I'm Still Here" from
"Follies."</TE>
<TE>   Her finale links Leon Russell's "A Song for You" with a
full-throttle rendition of Vincent Youmans' "Without a Song." At
Tuesday's opening, Bergen's genuine surprise at the standing ovation
she received was class personified, which sums up both this
incandescent performer and her must-see limited engagement.</TE>

<KH>Theme Park Review</KH>
<HD>But Where's Disney's Sense of Adventure?</HD>
<DH>The new rides that make up Flik's Fun Fair lack the
original park's inspiration.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBERT NILES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Disney is counting on a new collection of kids' rides to draw more
visitors to its troubled California Adventure theme park.
Unfortunately, Flik's Fun Fair provides yet another example of the
half-baked development that's made the rest of California Adventure
so disappointing.</LD>
<LD>   Flik's Fun Fair is made up of four dressed-up kiddie rides in the
re-christened A Bug's Land section of California Adventure. (Not to
be confused with that other local Bugs land for kids, the one named
for Bugs Bunny at Six Flags Magic Mountain.) In fact, Flik's Fun Fair
will look mighty familiar to any kid who's spent time at Magic
Mountain's Bugs Bunny World or Camp Snoopy at Knott's Berry Farm.
Actually, the Sierra-themed Camp Snoopy would fit better within this
park's alleged California theme.</LD>
<LD>   There's nothing unique to the Golden State in this land, which
serves up Heimlich's Chew Chew Train, a short tram ride through
oversize morsels of food; Tuck and Roll's Drive 'Em Buggies, perhaps
the world's slowest bumper car ride; Francis' Ladybug Boogie, a
spinning teacup-style ride; and Flik's Flyers, a Dumbo-like ride in
faux hot-air balloons. There is also a small water play area, where
kids can run through and around leaping streams of water.</LD>
<TE>   Parents should note that the bumper car ride has minimum heights
of 42 inches to ride and 48 inches to drive alone. Which should
create some awkward moments when 4-year-olds who are tall enough to
ride roller coasters such as the Matterhorn and Big Thunder Mountain
at Disneyland are told they can't ride the much tamer kiddie
bumper-car ride at California Adventure.</TE>
<TE>   Each ride in Flik's Fun Fair is named for characters from Pixar's
animated film "A Bug's Life." Indeed, the entire area is designed to
look like a scene from the film, with visitors reduced to a bug's
size. Giant stalks of green clover tower over the land, establishing
the visual theme while also providing much-needed shade in this
relatively treeless theme park. Lampposts are made to look like
drinking straws, and the benches are made to look as if they were
built from frozen fruit pop sticks.</TE>
<TE>   And yet, the illusion never convinces. None of the four young
children I brought with me to a preview day understood that they were
supposed to be bug-size, even after it was explained to them. Their
confusion is understandable. The scale is not consistent--the clover
towers over the drinking straws, which are unusually larger than the
pop sticks. Worse, there is no transition into this diminutive land
from the surrounding park. My most indelible memory of Disneyland as
a child is getting shrunk to atomic size in the old Adventures in
Inner Space ride in Tomorrowland. Riding through that giant
microscope, I was convinced that my body had been shrunk to
infinitesimal size.</TE>
<TE>   How wonderful it would have been for Disney to re-create such an
experience at the entrance to this land. For those who have not seen
"A Bug's Life," Flik is an ambitious ant who is always inventing new
contraptions to make life better for the hard-working ants in his
colony (with unintentionally amusing results, of course).</TE>
<TE>   Why not have visitors walk through some invention designed to
shrink them down to an ant's size, so they can help Flik and his
friends save the ant colony? It would have set a whimsical tone for
the area and given a visit a sense of story and purpose. It also
would have been the type of ingenious detail that the Knott's and Six
Flags kiddie lands lack--and that once distinguished Disney parks.</TE>
<TE>   Will kids have fun at Flik's Fun Fair? Sure. The piped-in
watermelon and animal cracker smells on Heimlich's Chew Chew Train
elicited laughs from my 5-year-old daughter. And the surprisingly
brisk pace of the flying balloons at Flik's Flyers pleased her
friends, twin boys from kindergarten class.</TE>
<TE>   But it's telling that it was the simplest element that left kids
with the widest smiles-- getting soaked in the water fountains. Kids
will enjoy the simple rides in Flik's Fun Fair, but a theme park that
charges $45 for adults and $35 for kids 3 to 9 needs to deliver much
more. (And don't forget the $8 parking fee and $2.75 bottled waters
and soft drinks.) Save your money, and find a great playground
instead.</TE>
<TE>   Disney corporate lore says that Walt dreamed up the idea for
Disneyland while watching his daughters ride the carousel at Griffith
Park. Today, a few steps from that same carousel, stands Shane's
Inspiration, a cleverly themed, disabled-accessible playground that
has provided my children--and thousands of others--with many more
hours of creative, exhausting fun than Flik's Fun Fair ever will. And
it doesn't cost a dime.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps Disney's management should take a walk in Walt's
footsteps, and pay a visit sometime.</TE>

<LD>The actor goes undercover on the streets of L.A. Wednesday nights at
9 in the new Fox series "Fastlane."</LD>
<LD>   Family Man: Well, I spend all week, every hour on the set, so my
weekends are gold. And I spend them with my family. Last weekend, we
just jumped in the car, drove south, found a little hotel and checked
in at 10 p.m. The next morning, we took my 5-year-old to Legoland.
That was pretty cool. It's perfect for kids from about 3 to 7 years
old. It's fun for adults too. I mean, you can see the Sydney Opera
House, the New York skyline, even the animals are built out of
Legos--I had Legos when I was a kid.</LD>
<LD>   The Simple Things: Sometimes we'll go to Ed Debevic's for dinner.
Now that's fun--having the waiter yell at you and talk trash. Last
week we went, and my daughter had chicken nuggets, we had barbecue
Cajun sandwiches and listened to the '50s music. Then we went to the
bookstore and spent an hour or two picking out books. The best thing
about a weekend is being together. It's about quality time, and the
simplest things are the best.</LD>
<TE>   Indie Films: I enjoy weekend nights and I'm usually so tired from
work, I like to do something like going to see a movie at the Laemmle
Sunset--they have cool, indie films.</TE>
<TE>   Hollywood Vibes: When we do the industry thing, we like to go out
to dinner at Firefly on Ventura Boulevard. It's got a great Hollywood
vibe, California cuisine, and it's in Studio City, where we live. It
looks like a living room in somebody's home; there are curtains that
you can draw around your table for privacy. It's fun, the music is
hip and it brings in a little bit of Hollywood.</TE>
<TE>   Getaways: Next week, we'll take our daughter to Sea World. We'll
just drive down to San Diego Friday night and stay some place close
to the park and go in the morning. I'll be tired from the workweek,
but we like to do something every weekend. Like my mom always says,
"You can sleep when you're dead."</TE>

<HD>Series Recalls Jim Crow's Ugly History</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOEL GREENBERG</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>PBS' new series "The Rise and Fall of Jim Crow" is filled with the
authoritative voices of historians and civil rights leaders and the
gut-wrenching remembrances of those who lived through part of this
sad era of "American apartheid."</LD>
<LD>   But no so-called expert--not even the victims of the nearly
century-long period of legally sanctioned segregation of African
American citizens--conveys the horror of that period nearly as well
as an elderly white man named Gordon Parks of Gainesville, Ga.
Inserted in the four-part series so subtly that you might miss him,
Parks is a living monument to the overt malice blacks faced from the
Civil War until the 1950s. (The series stops with the Supreme Court
desegregation decision in 1954.)</LD>
<LD>   Parks, still a member of the Ku Klux Klan, recalls his "first
lynching" of a black man with a chilling fondness, almost as if he
were recounting his first baseball game. Speaking with an ignorance
that suggests his mind has not developed much beyond what it was when
he witnessed that atrocity as a 9-year-old, Parks gives credit to his
grandpa--a Klan grand dragon--"and my daddy--he was a wizard." One
man "took and cut [the victim] from ear to ear and then they put the
rope around his neck and pulled him up in the tree, and we stayed
there about an hour ... be sure he died 'fore they left."</LD>
<TE>   Although relatively few white Americans fell into the same
horrific league as Parks and his white-sheeted buddies, racism during
this period was pervasive and suffocating throughout the country. It
was fueled by the phenomenon known as Jim Crow, a series of "white
supremacist laws and customs," the show says, instituted shortly
after the freeing of 4 million slaves in 1865 and lasting until the
Supreme Court overturned segregation in schools. (Jim Crow was also a
vaudeville-like caricature of blacks conjured up to entertain white
audiences.)</TE>
<TE>   One of the few ways that blacks were permitted to serve in the
same institution as whites was, of course, to fight in wars. And
repeatedly, it was the aftermath of war that hammered home to the
black soldier just how unwelcome he was in his own land.</TE>
<TE>   Future civil rights leader Hosea Williams returned to Georgia
after WWII and was beaten unconscious when he tried to get water at a
bus station. An undertaker came to pick up Williams' body, discovered
he was alive and took him to a hospital. "I laid there crying for
eight weeks wishing Adolf Hitler had won the war," Williams says.</TE>
<TE>   First-hand accounts like this--along with graphic photos, film and
drawings--make "The Rise and Fall of Jim Crow" a powerful window into
what African Americans have been up against since the Civil War. The
series is told with a methodical, measured tone that is the
antithesis of fast-paced "reality"-tinged TV newsmagazines. At times
it does feel a bit like going to school. But that may very well be
what many of us need.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   "The Rise and Fall of Jim Crow" airs on four successive Thursdays
at 8 p.m. on KCET, starting tonight. It has been rated TVPG (may be
inappropriate for young children).</TE>

<HD>From Charlap: Nonstandard Standards</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DON HECKMAN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Pianist Bill Charlap's lineage almost guarantees a familiarity with
the Great American Songbook. His father, Moose Charlap, was a
Broadway composer who wrote some of the music for "Peter Pan"; his
mother, Sandy Stewart, was a singer with the Benny Goodman Orchestra.</LD>
<LD>   So it wasn't surprising that Charlap's first set on Tuesday at the
Jazz Bakery was largely dedicated to such classic song items as "The
Best Thing for You Would Be Me," "All Through the Night," "Blue
Skies" and "My Shining Hour." Nor was it unexpected that his audience
was peppered with the sort of celebrities who would usually only show
up at the Bakery for a performance by, say, Woody Allen.</LD>
<LD>   That said, however, Charlap's playing offered some authentic jazz
views of his material. His style can best be defined by listing a few
noble predecessors who came to mind throughout the set: Erroll
Garner, Ahmad Jamal, Tommy Flanagan, Peter Nero and Roger Williams.
That's an eclectic list, by any estimation, but Charlap revealed bits
and pieces of style and manner from each. The pace, timing and
structure of Garner and Jamal; the brisk, bop-based swing of
Flanagan; the engaging personality of Nero; and the rhapsodic
pianistics of Williams.</LD>
<TE>   There were times when the lack of focus produced by this range of
influences was distracting. He opened "All Through the Night," for
example, with a grandly extravagant cadenza before suddenly shifting
into up-tempo high gear as his two accompanists, bassist Peter
Washington and drummer Kenny Washington, joined him. Other pieces
were delivered in similarly disjunct fashion, often shifting emphasis
in ways that seemed unreflective of both the words and the music of
the songs--a surprising lapse in an artist with such a strong
awareness of the full, story-telling qualities of classic standards.</TE>
<TE>   When he was good, however, Charlap was very good indeed. The
suspended sense of drama he brought to the slower ballads, for
example, was exquisite, a stunningly effective use of tone and
timing. And in the passages in which he momentarily set aside pre-set
arrangements and virtuosic technical displays and simply dug into
inventive, spontaneous improvising, one finally got a sense of the
high quality of his jazz skills.</TE>
<TE>   Charlap was particularly well aided by the presence of the two
Washingtons. Drummer Kenny Washington's brush playing was a marvel to
hear, and together the two players adroitly maneuvered through the
music's frequent starts and stops while maintaining a propulsively
dynamic, rhythmic swing.</TE>

<HD>Intimate 'Broadcast'</HD>
<DH>Doves gain popularity as their message spreads, one
listener at a time</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE HOCHMAN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Jimi Goodwin, singer of the English band Doves, isn't sure he wants
to be in a radio world where, as he has just learned, Justin
Timberlake earned extra airplay from a New York radio station by
revealing on the air personal details about intimacies with
ex-girlfriend Britney Spears.</LD>
<LD>   Well, first, he's not sure he has much to offer in that regard.</LD>
<LD>   "I don't know who's going to be excited about what my girlfriend
and I did two weeks ago," he says with a self-mocking laugh.</LD>
<TE>   But more seriously, he looks at the Timberlake incident as just
one more confirmation that American commercial radio is not going to
be very hospitable to acts, including Doves, that strive for
emotional depth, artistic ambition and intellectual literacy.</TE>
<TE>   "Radio is messed up," he says. "We're not relying on it."</TE>
<TE>   But the state of radio is not what Goodwin and twin brothers Jez
and Andy Williams were referring to when they titled their recent,
second album "The Last Broadcast." Rather, it's about intimacy and
connection, expanding on the theme of the album's title song.</TE>
<TE>   "The lyrics for that one are almost an open letter," he says. "It
says, 'Here we are; is this the last broadcast?' As in me and you,
late-night conversation with the girlfriend where it could end right
now and you stay up until dawn and either have great make-up sex or
you end up sleeping on the couch.</TE>
<TE>   "As the title for the album, it could be seen as sounding kind of
final--we've had people saying, 'Are you splitting up? Are you just
trying to get publicity?' No, it just seemed to go with the songs. We
like the idea of broadcasting, of reaching out. I wanted to call it
'Where We're Calling From' after an instrumental piece on the album."</TE>
<TE>   That focus on connection, both interpersonal and with an audience,
is the essence of Doves for Goodwin and the Williams brothers, all
32. It also describes the band's strategy in lieu of radio exposure.
"All we've got is a fan base that digs us," Goodwin says. "We have to
take some comfort in that."</TE>
<TE>   And they have to be patient. "The Last Broadcast" has earned great
acclaim and was a hit in England behind the No. 1 single "There Goes
the Fear," an uplifting song of emotional reassurance. And in the
U.S., with some prominent noncommercial radio support, that fan base
proved solid. In the four months since its June release here,
"Broadcast" has sold nearly 70,000 copies, a figure it took its
predecessor, 2000's "Lost Souls," more than 18 months to reach.</TE>
<TE>   Further growth in the U.S. has been slow, but patience comes
naturally as the band makes its second swing through the U.S. this
year, with shows Tuesday and Wednesday at the Mayan Theatre.</TE>
<TE>   Up From Sub Sub</TE>
<TE>   Just getting this far has been a long, slow journey. In the early
'90s, the three worked together as Sub Sub, a promising act in the
Manchester acid-house scene that is showcased in the film "24 Hour
Party People." A beat-heavy 1993 single "Ain't No Love (Ain't No
Use)" was a No. 3 hit in the U.K., and their inventive uses of sonic
ambience led to collaborations with Tricky and New Order's Bernard
Sumner.</TE>
<TE>   But after a 1995 fire in their studio destroyed their equipment
and recordings, the three decided to take a different direction,
regrouping as Doves with live instruments rather than computers and
turntables, and looking to such acts as introspective hometown heroes
the Smiths for inspiration.</TE>
<TE>   It was four years before they finished an album, but "Lost Souls"
earned glowing reviews for its big themes and sonic sweep, with
comparisons to the Smiths, U2, Echo &amp; the Bunnymen and even Pink
Floyd. On a creative roll, the group took only 10 months to complete
the new album. That energy and optimism are reflected in the
uplifting themes, which to many contrast sharply to the dark hues of
"Lost Souls," though Goodwin doesn't think of either of them as
downcast.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought 'Lost Souls' was an upbeat album," Goodwin says. "It
articulated our 20s to me--try to get somewhere, try to better
ourselves, become the great band we were in our heads. That's
positive. There's a lot of beauty and hope in there. And the new one
as well. 'There Goes the Fear' and 'Pounding' are markedly different,
nothing like them on 'Lost Souls.' "</TE>
<TE>   Giving Doves hope and rewarding the patience is the evidence that
their broadcast is reaching people.</TE>
<TE>   "So far with us, it's really been that one friend buying it, plays
it for five friends and then the five friends buy it," Goodwin says.
"You have to love that. It's great."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>

<LD>   2 Pianos, 4 Hands--At first, "2 Pianos, 4 Hands" looks like
nothing more than a playful account of two boys who are learning to
play the piano. Soon, however, the production resonates beyond the
world of music. It explores the feelings that arise after the awful
discovery that you're not going to make it in the career for which
you've prepared for years. It appears that pianists Ted Dykstra and
Richard Greenblatt took up acting, and the theater, after concluding
that they wouldn't be Horowitzes. Dykstra and Greenblatt--both
Canadians--not only wrote "2 Pianos, 4 Hands," but they named the
leading characters Ted and Richard, and first played the roles
themselves. The authors aren't on stage at La Mirada Theatre, but
their substitutes, Mark Anders as Ted and Carl J. Danielsen as
Richard, bring ample conviction and polish--musical as well as
dramatic--to the roles as they progress through their pianistic
educations, from ages 8 to 18. Occasionally we see the two boys
together--as wary rivals, as competitive duet performers and,
finally, as friends in their 30s who still carry a torch for the
piano, though they've moved on to other careers. Directed by Bruce J.
Sevy, Anders and Danielsen adeptly whip through their sketches and a
wide range of musical excerpts. They open and close with a more
extended performance of the first movement of a Bach concerto.</LD>

<HD>The First Family of TV</HD>
<DH>Television* 'Ozzie and Harriet' went on the air 50 years
ago today, forming the template for sitcoms from 'Father Knows Best'
to 'The Simpsons.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROGER K. MILLER</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>On a Friday night 50 years ago today, amid some anxiety from ABC
executives about the show's appeal, "The Adventures of Ozzie and
Harriet" was televised for the first time. They needn't have worried;
it stayed on the air for 14 years, setting a record for the
longest-running family sitcom.</LD>
<LD>   It's a record that will be tied when "The Simpsons" returns to Fox
for its 14th season next month. Even if "The Simpsons" beats the
longevity record, it's currently 144 episodes shy of "Ozzie and
Harriet's" 435. Anyway, "Ozzie and Harriet" had been a weekly series
on radio for eight years before it jumped to TV. (The radio show
continued until 1954.)</LD>
<LD>   Obviously, those numbers reflect one of the most popular shows
ever. "Ozzie and Harriet" did not quite invent the family TV
sitcom--there were others present at the creation, such as "The Stu
Erwin Show," which aired from 1950 to 1955--but it created the mold
for what we think of as "family sitcom," from which were cast such
solid ingots as "Father Knows Best" and "Leave It to Beaver," right
up to such variations on the theme as "Malcolm in the Middle" and,
yes, "The Simpsons."</LD>
<TE>   In addition to its longevity, it also has been one of the most
mocked, derided and parodied shows, with comics noting Ozzie's
seemingly invisible job.</TE>
<TE>   He may have been the butt of jokes, but by any measure the most
important ingredient in the show's durable success would have to have
been Oswald George Nelson, an extremely savvy and industrious
businessman and entertainer. Born March 20, 1906, in Jersey City,
N.J., he was an Eagle Scout by age 13. He graduated from Rutgers
University, where he was a star quarterback, and attended law school,
but he quickly abandoned law for music when the dance band he had
formed in college began to enjoy success.</TE>
<TE>   Mix in the next ingredient: Peggy Lou Snyder. Born in Des Moines
on July 18, 1909, she took the name Harriet Hilliard when she began
in vaudeville. She joined Ozzie's band in 1932, becoming only the
second female vocalist featured in a big band (the first was Mildred
Bailey, with Paul Whiteman), and they expanded their success with
recordings. She also joined Ozzie in marriage, in October 1935. Their
first son, David Ozzie, was born in 1936, followed by Eric Hilliard
(Ricky) in 1940.</TE>
<TE>   By this time, the late 1930s and early '40s, Harriet, and then
both of them, began appearing in movies. By this time too, the
touring dance band was in decline. In 1941, the Nelsons moved from
New Jersey to Hollywood, where Ozzie became bandleader for Red
Skelton's radio program, on which Harriet sang and played several
roles.</TE>
<TE>   The sea change came in 1944: CBS offered the Nelsons their own
radio show. On Oct. 8 (the couple's ninth wedding anniversary),
listeners first heard the chirpy, upbeat opening that people who
today are of Social Security age probably still can recall: "From
Hollywood--International Silver Co., creators of International
Sterling, presents 'The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet,' starring
America's favorite young couple, Ozzie Nelson and Harriet Hilliard!"</TE>
<TE>   Bemused and Out of Sync</TE>
<TE>   Centered on the couple's real-life personalities, the show
initially dealt with the comic trials of a bandleader and his family.
Gradually, the content and format developed that would remain
essentially unchanged for the next two decades: Ozzie hesitant,
bemused and out of sync with what was going on around him,
Harriet--like all succeeding sitcom moms--the solid rock of their
little universe.</TE>
<TE>   Only when the boys reached their later teens, and especially when
Ricky began singing and playing rock 'n' roll on the TV show, did
their universe begin to expand and then come apart. At first, the
boys were only in the background, mentioned but not heard. When their
characters were given speaking roles, they were played by
professional child actors. Finally in January 1949, with both of them
jealous of their performing counterparts, David and Ricky took over
their own roles.</TE>
<TE>   They were a hit, especially brash, effervescent, irrepressible
Ricky, responding to the straight lines fed him by his stolid,
slightly boring older brother. Ricky's famous catchphrase, "I don't
mess around, boy," was thought up by Ozzie's brother, Don, a staff
writer.</TE>
<TE>   Ozzie, who almost continuously throughout the family's broadcast
history took on the roles of writer, producer and director, didn't
mess around, either. Television had poked its head above the horizon,
and he was determined to be part of what he was sure was
entertainment's future. In 1952, he made "Here Come the Nelsons,"
their only movie, to pave the way and prove to TV executives that the
Nelsons were photogenic.</TE>
<TE>   In its own way, "The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet" was, like
"Seinfeld," a sitcom about nothing. Countless parodies have been
built on the fact that little happened on any episode--and the little
that did happen was so low-key as to mock the title's "adventures."
Although as head of the Nelson empire Ozzie worked nonstop, his lack
of an occupation in the series became the butt of many jokes. This
irked the uncompromising perfectionist. He claimed that audiences
could identify with him more readily because his work was unspecific.
Besides, he said, as he envisioned the shows in his head, they always
fell on a weekend.</TE>
<TE>   It didn't matter. Audiences loved it from the beginning, just as
they had loved the radio version. Relaxed, cozy, even mundane in its
mild humor, its ideal of domesticity was something that postwar
America yearned for. (Despite the show's squeaky-clean image, the
Nelsons were the first TV couple to share a double bed. They thought
twin beds for a married couple were absurd, and they had such an
ironclad contract with ABC that they could build the show the way
they wanted with little sponsor or network interference.)</TE>
<TE>   It was an ideal, one based on Ozzie's memories of his childhood.
Admittedly, the Nelsons strove for a kind of verisimilitude, chiefly
by playing themselves. One radio writer remarked that the Nelsons
"really were like the people on the show." Their TV house was modeled
after their real one, and Ozzie incorporated many elements of their
lives--neighbors, family, events--into the program.</TE>
<TE>   This trompe l'oeil effect surely added to the show's enormous
popularity, and some viewers may have fooled themselves that it did
represent reality. Yet it was a family affair in several respects.
Don Nelson married an actress on the radio show. David as well as
Ozzie directed episodes of the TV show. Writers, never the most
uncritical breed, spoke of the comfortable feeling working there, one
noting that Ozzie "operated the show like a family."</TE>
<TE>   But postwar doesn't last forever, and ideals can't resist change
eternally. The show's vague concept wasn't baggy enough to embrace
the boys' going off to college, becoming lawyers and marrying.</TE>
<TE>   Surprisingly, for a long time it managed to contain Rick's
steadily growing singing career, which began in the fall of 1956 with
an episode in which he organized a band in high school and was truly
launched in April 1957 when he sang Fats Domino's "I'm Walkin'."</TE>
<TE>   The final original telecast had an end-of-an-era tone. Ozzie was
thinking of buying a pool table and converting David and Ricky's
vacant bedroom into a game room, but Harriet would have nothing of
it.</TE>
<TE>   A Nelson Biopic</TE>
<TE>   "The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet" had its last network
telecast on Saturday, Sept. 3, 1966. The "boys"--men now--were going
off in their own directions, Rick with his singing and acting career;
David, producing and directing.</TE>
<TE>   In 1973, Ozzie and Harriet tried a syndicated series (produced by
David) called "Ozzie's Girls," in which they rented out the boys' old
room to two female college students. It limped along for barely a
year.</TE>
<TE>   Ozzie died of cancer in 1975. Harriet died of congestive heart
failure in 1994. She had continued to make appearances on TV dramas
and sitcoms for many years, her last being a 1989 episode of the
"Father Dowling Mysteries" that starred her granddaughter, Tracy
Nelson, Rick's daughter.</TE>
<TE>   Rick died in a plane crash on Dec. 31, 1985. David had a busy
directing and producing career, but has pretty much stayed out of the
business for the last decade or so.</TE>
<TE>   Now we may get the "Adventures of the Adventures," so to speak.
CBS reportedly is planning a TV movie-biography of the Nelsons, to be
produced by Tracy and her brother Gunnar. No doubt it will be
interesting, but, oddly enough, as low-key as the original may have
been, this venture is likely to pale in comparison.</TE>

<LD>For years it was common to cook pork to death, and you've probably
had your share of dry, woody pork chops. Fortunately, things are
changing.</LD>
<LD>   Il Grano: If you're an adventurous eater, order the nodino di
vitella avvolto nel lardo di Colonnata, fonduta di porri. OK, now,
what is it? A 2-inch chunk of pork loin wrapped in a slab of cured
pork jowl (like pancetta) and grilled till the outside is crisp,
served on melted leeks. (Nodino di vitella, $24.) Il Grano, 11359
Santa Monica Blvd., West Los Angeles, (310) 477-7886.</LD>
<LD>   *</LD>
<TE>   Thai This: There are two popular pork dishes here. Garlic pork is
stir-fried strips mixed with a paste of garlic, cilantro stems, white
pepper and sea salt. It's served with salad and jasmine rice. For a
spicier dish, try the chile pork, in which the stir-fried meat is
flavored with garlic, shallots, dried red chiles, kaffir lime leaves,
roasted peanuts and galangal. It also comes with rice and salad.
(Both pork dishes, $10.95.) Thai This, 24501 Del Prado, Dana Point,
(949) 240-7944.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Windows: There are spectacular views from the top floor of the
Transamerica building. While you're checking them out, you can have a
pork loin chop stuffed with a twist on the creamed spinach idea:
spinach, mascarpone and shiitake mushrooms. It comes with a sweet
potato and a goat cheese timbale. The entire dish is laced with a
thyme-dried cranberry glaze. (Roasted stuffed pork loin chop,
$22.95.) Windows, Transamerica Center, 1150 S. Olive St., Los
Angeles, (213) 746-1554.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Casa Antigua: This unusual dish consists of two center-cut pork
chops sauteed in olive oil and surrounded by bite-sized chunks of
sauteed cactus paddles (nopales) and cilantro potatoes. It's dressed
with a slightly sweet, mildly spicy sauce of garlic, onions, olive
oil, achiote paste, and orange and lemon juices. (Chuleta de puerco
pibil, $19.) Casa Antigua Cantina, 12217 Wilshire Blvd., Los Angeles,
(310) 820-2540.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Joe's: Here's the perfect dish for a chilly autumn evening. It's a
tender pork tenderloin rolled in diced turnips and carrots and pan
roasted until brown all over. Then it's sliced into medallions, which
are served with roasted garlic on a bed of mashed potatoes with a
mixture of oyster, blue foot and shiitake mushrooms, the whole thing
covered in a delicate pork jus. (Crepinette of pork, roasted garlic
mashed potatoes and wild mushrooms, $20.) Joe's, 1023 Abbot Kinney

<LD>   S.F. Opera in the Red  to Tune of $7.7 Million</LD>
<LD>   On stage, the San Francisco Opera has covered itself in glory
lately, with critics nationwide glowing over its production of "Saint
Francois d'Assise." But backstage, the red ink has been rising.</LD>
<TE>   Opera officials this week disclosed that for the fiscal year ended
July 31, the company spent $7.7 million more than it took in. That
deficit amounts to the organization's worst financial performance in
more than a decade, and a striking turnaround for a company that was
reporting a balanced budget as recently as July 2001.</TE>
<TE>   Board President Karl O. Mills has blamed the weakened economy for
the funding shortfall--specifically, declines in ticket sales and
contributions to the company, whose annual operating budget is
roughly $60 million. Spokeswoman Elizabeth Connell Nielsen said the
organization, which instituted a hiring freeze and tightened spending
late last year, would use $7 million in unrestricted funds from its
$44-million endowment to maintain cash flow in the short term, and in
the longer term might consider higher ticket prices or further
spending reductions.</TE>

<TE>   Rapper Cut From Film; Activist Takes Credit</TE>
<TE>   Rapper Snoop Dogg has been edited out of an upcoming Muppets TV
movie, and an African American activist is taking credit for the
removal.</TE>
<TE>   Najee Ali, head of Los Angeles-based Project Islamic Hope, said he
pressured the Jim Henson Co. to take Snoop Dogg out of NBC's "A Very
Merry Muppet Christmas" because of the rapper's pro-drug persona and
his involvement with several pornographic video projects.</TE>
<TE>   Henson executives said that the editing of Snoop Dogg's appearance
had nothing to do with Ali's protest. "As commonly occurs during this
stage of production, we have had to cut several scenes originally
planned for the movie which did not advance its story line," the
company said in a statement.</TE>
<TE>   Insiders familiar with the Henson Co. acknowledged that although
Snoop Dogg's footage would have been cut because the movie was
running long, executives were also concerned about information they
learned recently that the rapper is planning to release another
triple X-rated video this fall.</TE>
<TE>   CNN Memo Touts  Use of Hip-Hop Lingo</TE>
<TE>   Hoping to attract younger viewers, CNN Headline News apparently
will soon be using hip-hop slang in its news crawls.</TE>
<TE>   "In an effort to be sure we are as cutting edge as possible with
our on-screen persona, please refer to this slang dictionary when
looking for just the right phrase," says a memo to some production
personnel that was obtained by the New York Daily News.</TE>
<TE>   Among the approved slang: "jimmy hat" for condom and "fly" for
sexually attractive.</TE>
<TE>   ABC's New Tuesday Lineup Holds Its Own</TE>
<TE>   ABC's comedy block delivered a solid ratings performance Tuesday
night, according to Nielsen Media Research viewing estimates.</TE>
<TE>   With Fox's "That '70s Show" preempted by baseball, ABC's "8 Simple
Rules for Dating My Teenager Daughter" improved over the previous
week, to 13.4 million viewers, easily surpassing NBC's "In-Laws" in
its time slot and finishing just behind CBS' "JAG." Another ABC
newcomer, "Life With Bonnie," averaged more than 11 million viewers,
compared with 14.5 million watching NBC's long-running "Frasier" at 9
p.m.</TE>

<HD>Cultural Outreach Inspires Mexican Film Series</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>LORENZA MUNOZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>For years, the French, Spanish and Norwegian consulates have actively
promoted the art, film and culture from their home countries in the
United States. Mexico's representatives, on the other hand, have
never been involved in such promotion--until recently.</LD>
<LD>   On Friday, the American Cinematheque will host the second
Contemporary Mexican Film Series, showcasing seven films and one
series of shorts. In addition to several contemporary Mexican films,
audiences will be able to see a screening of Miramax's "Frida,"
starring Salma Hayek, ahead of its scheduled Oct. 25 release.</LD>
<LD>   The film series, which began last year, was the brainchild of
Alejandro Pelayo Rangel, cultural attache for the Mexican consulate
in Los Angeles. Pelayo was the former head of the Mexican Institute
of Cinema and former director of the Mexican Film Archive.</LD>
<TE>   Because Mexican film is experiencing a kind of renaissance and so
few Mexican movies receive U.S. distribution, Pelayo thought it was
time to begin a series, similar to the cinematheque's Recent Spanish
Cinema and Argentine Film Festival series.</TE>
<TE>   "There are festivals in Los Angeles that include Latin American
films, but there was never an event solely for Mexican film," Pelayo
said. "We think this is a very important market for Mexican film."</TE>
<TE>   The films featured in the L.A. series have made their rounds at
such festivals as San Sebastian, Montreal and Toronto, and include
"The Caiman's Dream," "Japan," "Dark Cities," "Stories to Put the
Crocodiles to Sleep," and "The Sparrow Hawk of the Sierra."</TE>
<TE>   In addition to "Frida," the series will also screen Hayek's 1995
movie "Miracle Alley."</TE>
<TE>   The L.A. festival is part of an effort by Mexican President
Vicente Fox to establish a stronger presence for cultural emissaries
here and abroad. Last year, in addition to sending Pelayo to L.A.,
the president sent novelist Jorge Volpe to Paris, and playwright Hugo
Hiriart to New York as cultural attaches.</TE>

<LD>* Kim Richey, "Rise," Lost Highway. The singer-songwriter is usually
classified as a country artist, but her work has been moving in a
more general pop direction. Produced by Bill Bottrell, her fourth
album employs wheezy, new-wave keyboards along with banjos and
acoustic guitars. More to the point, different songs evoke such
emotionally insightful artists as Aimee Mann and Tom Petty. Despite
Richey's widely varied tunes--including the muted, bluesy "Girl in a
Car," the torchy Latin-flavored "Without You" and the Band-esque
"Cowards in a Brave New World"--the collection's restrained
production creates a unifying sense of solitary reflection. Her
assessments feel more like portraits painted from memory than like
snapshots of moments.</LD>

<LD>* New this week: "Brotherhood of the Wolf" is the cinematic
equivalent of fusion cuisine. It's not only that this French-language
film was made by an internationally diverse production team, it's
also that its very sensibility is an unapologetic melange, mixing
elements of French, Asian and American cinema in ways that amuse and
lead to indigestion. A cross-cultural hoot that no one should take
too seriously, it's a film set in an imaginary 18th century, in which
some people write with quill pens and others kick like Jackie Chan.
It's based on a historic incident, a series of more than 100 brutal
attacks by an unknown animal that understandably terrorized that
region in the South of France.</LD>

<HD>Actors Co-op Revives an Engaging and Passionate 'Man of La
Mancha'</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>DAVID C. NICHOLS</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Sharp theatricality decorates "Man of La Mancha," opening the 11th
season at the Actors Co-op. Dale Wasserman, Mitch Leigh and Joe
Darion's 1965 Tony-winning "Don Quixote" musical receives a
beautifully designed chamber revival whose passionate conviction
springs directly from its principal liability, but more on that
later.</LD>
<LD>   Robert Bingham's fine 16th century prison set conveys mood from
the outset. Swathed in Bill E. Kickbush's dusky lighting, a lone
guitarist (the superb John Minei) performs the overture, and
Wasserman's play-within-a-play begins.</LD>
<LD>   The premise pitches Miguel de Cervantes (Ted Rooney) and his
manservant (Raul Clayton Staggs) into a group of fellow prisoners of
the Spanish Inquisition. Their cellblock tribunal leads to the acting
out of Quixote's saga, beginning with Cervantes' transformation into
the deluded knight-errant during the title number.</LD>
<TE>   By the finale, the fates of author and creation have intersected,
underlining the thesis of the defining anthem, "The Impossible
Dream": true heroism lies in the striving for the ideal, regardless
of its attainment.</TE>
<TE>   Director Robin Strand maintains palpable atmosphere, as do the
designers, with A. Laura Brody's costume plot exceptional. David O's
arrangements augment the lean accompaniment with choral
embellishments, and Chris Salmon's choreography is stylized and
spontaneous.</TE>
<TE>   So is the acting. Rooney's gangly physicality and consummate
technique are profoundly apt, and Staggs is an appealing Sancho. As
the harlot Aldonza, whose inner nobility only Quixote perceives,
Diane Martinous is fiercely touching, and the surrounding ensemble is
fearless.</TE>
<TE>   The emphasis on dramatic values is no accident. Barring Gary Lee
Reed's pure-toned padre and Denise Scarms' chirpy niece, the cast
lacks sufficient vocal heft for Leigh and Darion's rangy score,
substituting interpretive intensity for instrumental entitlement.
Although this generates considerable raw impact, musical theater
devotees should nevertheless prepare to exercise forbearance.</TE>

<HD>Recovered Footage Makes This a Mighty Version of
'Metropolis'</HD>

<AU>KEVIN THOMAS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The new restoration of Fritz Lang's futuristic 1927 masterpiece
"Metropolis," completed to mark the 75th anniversary of its release,
is such a revelation it is like seeing this frequently revived silent
classic for the first time. This Kino release begins a one-week run
Friday at the Nuart.</LD>
<LD>   Working since 1998 with a consortium of German film archives and
various international organizations, under the auspices of the
Friedrich Wilhelm Murnau Foundation, preservationist Martin Koerber
oversaw a digital restoration that incorporates 1,320 feet of
recovered footage and Gottfried Huppertz's majestic, fluid score,
performed by the Radio Sinfonieorchester Saarbrucken, conducted by
Bernd Heller.</LD>
<LD>   Not only are the film's bold Expressionist images, photographed by
the masters Karl Freund and Gunther Rittau, startlingly sharp but
also the new English intertitles, set in the typeface and format of
the German originals, are far more precise and illuminating than
their predecessors.</LD>
<TE>   They also are used to bridge gracefully about a quarter of the
footage that's still missing from the 153-minute original release
version of the film, which now runs two hours and five minutes.</TE>
<TE>   With full narrative continuity restored, "Metropolis" is a far
richer, more nuanced experience, adding crucial humanizing motivation
and dimension to performances of the cast, which acts in an
Expressionist manner as highly stylized as Japanese Noh drama. What's
more, "Metropolis" acquires a post-9/11 meaning in its depiction of
the vulnerability of a great modern city.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, the film, based on Thea von Harbou's adaptation of her
novel, owes much of its city-of-the-future look to a visit that
director Lang made to Manhattan in the early '20s. It was created
spectacularly by art directors Otto Hunte, Erich Kettelhut and Karl
Vollbrecht, with future film director Edgar G. Ulmer as set designer.</TE>
<TE>   Joh Fredersen (Alfred Abel), the austere master of Metropolis,
commands all he surveys from an immense suite atop his New Tower of
Babel, the city-state's tallest skyscraper. Via a closed-circuit TV
system, he can communicate with Grot (Heinrich George), supervisor of
the Heart Machine, which produces the energy required to run
Metropolis. It is located in the Lower City, miles below the Earth's
surface, in which the worker class lives and labors as virtual
slaves.</TE>
<TE>   One day, the beautiful Maria (Brigitte Helm) manages to board an
elevator from the Lower City with a group of children and ride to the
top of Babel, where she confronts Fredersen's son Freder (Gustav
Frohlich) and some pals cavorting in an artificial grotto with
revealingly dressed beauties.</TE>
<TE>   "These are your brothers," Maria tells the children. Then, looking
directly at Freder, she declares, "They are your brothers,"
indicating the children. After Maria and the youngsters are swiftly
ejected, the naive, sheltered Freder, transfixed by her beauty and
her words, pursues her to the Lower City, where he arrives just in
time to witness the explosion of a vast machine, killing and injuring
many.</TE>
<TE>   In his horror-stricken imagination, the spluttering, steaming
broken machine becomes Moloch, the god of fire. In an instant, Freder
determines to better the lot of the workers, whose mood is growing
ever more rebellious.</TE>
<TE>   When Fredersen learns of the growing danger from the workers, he
visits Rotwang (Rudolf Klein-Rogge, who preceded Lang as Harbou's
husband), a brilliant but deranged inventor-scientist in his
cottage-fortress tucked between the girders of a bridge. Rotwang lost
the love of his life to Fredersen, and she died giving birth to
Freder, but Rotwang shows Fredersen a robot he devised that has the
ability to bring Fredersen's wife back to life. Fredersen suggests he
use it to replicate Maria as a lewd, depraved creature who will
sabotage the real Maria's effort to stir up resistance by the
workers. Rotwang agrees, but for his own dark purposes of revenge.
The grand struggle of the forces of good and evil is now underway in
earnest.</TE>
<TE>   "Metropolis" begins and ends with the statement of its message:
"The mediator between the hand (Labor)and the head (Management) must
be the Heart!" This sentiment would in time cause Lang to regard
"Metropolis" as corny, to use his description. Yet, in his later
years, he reconsidered his view, deciding that the promptings of the
heart might be the only thing that could stop mankind from destroying
itself. (310) 478-6379.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   On Friday and Saturday at 8 p.m. and Sunday at 1 and 4. p.m. the
Silent Movie will screen another classic of the golden age of the
German silent cinema, F.W. Murnau's timelessly eerie vampire picture,
"Nosferatu" (1922), with the important added attraction of Georges
Melies' fanciful, century-old "A Trip to the Moon," which
incorporates some newly discovered missing footage.</TE>
<TE>   Film historian David Shepard (who restored Lang's 1920 two-part
thriller "The Spiders") will recite an English translation of "A Trip
to the Moon's" original French intertitles.(323) 655-2520.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   A couple of the most highly regarded films in the American
Cinematheque's annual Contemporary Mexican Films series, which runs
Friday through Monday at the Egyptian, prove disappointing. Beto
Gomez's "The Caiman's Dream," which opens the festival Friday at 7
p.m., is a routine crime comedy involving some affably feckless
crooks. Fernando Sarinana's "Dark City" (Sunday at 5:30 p.m.) is such
a shamelessly lurid soap opera of big-city low life that it verges on
parody.</TE>
<TE>   A better entry is Saturday's sold-out 7 p.m. sneak preview of the
eagerly anticipated "Frida," which kicks off a Salma Hayek tribute
that includes a reprise of the entertaining 1995 "Miracle Alley"
(Saturday at 10:15 p.m.). Another to take a chance on: Carlos
Reygadas' "Japon," (Friday, 9:30 p.m.), which was unavailable for
preview and which won a special mention at the Directors Fortnight at
Cannes. (323) 466-FILM.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Note: The UCLA Film Archive presents "Earth--The Films of
Alexander Dovzhenko," a selection of six pictures by the boldly
poetic Soviet pioneer, tonight through Tuesday at Melnitz Hall's
James Bridges Theater. (310) 206-FILM.</TE>

<LD>A young film star's "dream team" defense turns a murder case into a
nightmare for the gang from "CSI: Crime Scene Investigation" tonight
at 9 on CBS.</LD>
<LD>   The third-year drama, which racked up huge numbers in its season
premiere last week, already has such broad coattails as a franchise
that its new spinoff, "CSI: Miami," also finished in the top 10
nationally. Nevertheless, the original show's cast has been grousing
publicly in recent days about the potential for a dilution of the
product because of the divided attentions of the programs' creators.</LD>
<LD>   But tonight's slick episode, "The Accused Is Entitled," written by
former L.A. County sheriff's investigator Elizabeth Devine and
executive producer Anne Donahue, suggests that at least for now,
those fears are groundless.</LD>
<TE>   Devine, who has been on hand as a technical advisor since the
series' inception, reached back to her experiences and feelings from
the O.J. Simpson case to craft a story in which the CSI squad itself
is put on trial by the defense team for alleged flaws in its
evidence-gathering techniques.</TE>
<TE>   Guest star Chad Michael Murray ("Gilmore Girls," "Dawson's Creek")
plays the film star whose night of passion with a pair of beauties
takes a vicious and deadly turn. Musician Jakob Dylan and his band
the Wallflowers play along.</TE>

<LD>The main drag of Valencia is roped off. A fresh coat of asphalt has
been slapped on and, in a reenactment of a centuries-old tradition
from Italy, artists from near and far will spend hours this weekend
crouched over squares marked on the street.</LD>
<LD>   Using strongly pigmented chalk sticks called soft pastels, they
reproduce large-scale paintings from Renaissance and Baroque masters:
bucolic landscapes, darkly majestic images of saints, familiar
renditions of ample-bosomed Madonnas.</LD>
<LD>   Most of the artists participating in the Bella Via Italian street
painting festival in Valencia won't be paid. A group of four deemed
"featured artists" will each be compensated between $1,000 and $2,500
for the weekend's work.</LD>
<TE>   Some arrive days in advance to begin sketching and coloring on
their oversized works.</TE>
<TE>   For the fourth year in a row, the quiet, decidedly suburban town
known chiefly for its proximity to the Six Flags amusement park and
CalArts, will turn into a bubbling caldron of artistic activity on
Saturday and Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   For the artists, the experience is similar to running a marathon,
especially on a hot weekend. "You really have to push through and
push past that point where you want to quit," says local artist Julie
Kirk, who's been involved in all previous editions of the Bella Via
festival and this year plans to re-create Caravaggio's "Christ in the
Garden" in a square that measures 10 by 13 feet.</TE>
<TE>   In all of this, it is the festival-goers who get the sweet end of
the deal. They typically stroll about at a leisurely pace and merely
observe the artists struggle with the physical demands of the work.
In that regard, the event is not only pleasant but educational. It
drives home the realization that this kind of art--figurative,
monumental in scale, painstakingly detailed--extracts a toll of
blood, sweat and tears.</TE>
<TE>   Remember Charlton Heston's Michelangelo in "The Agony and the
Ecstasy," sandwiched in a horizontal position under the ceiling of
the Sistine Chapel and laboring over one of his Sybils as paint
dripped into his eyes? Well, drawing large reproductions of European
masterworks in chalk on hot asphalt for three to four days in a row
is no slapdash feat either. The single largest project featured this
year will measure 15 by 20 feet; that's 300 square feet of ground to
cover.</TE>
<TE>   "There is this image of artists being flaky and not working hard,"
Kirk says. But once the process is seen firsthand, "a lot of people
have a new respect for it."</TE>
<TE>   And maybe a new appreciation for works that otherwise remain
confined to the pages of coffee-table volumes or the walls of museum
exhibits.</TE>
<TE>   "Many people who come to Bella Via have never been to the Sistine
Chapel," says festival co-director Carol Maglione, who has organized
and coordinated the event since 1999. "They have never seen a
Caravaggio."</TE>
<TE>   To them, the festival provides a crash course in Renaissance art
and its substantial rewards: the rich detail in the folds of a
garment draped across a stretched arm, the infinite nuances of light
and shadow, the facial expressions that are both exquisitely human
and divinely larger-than-life.</TE>
<TE>   There are simpler pleasures too. An entire block is set aside so
children (and adults, if they like) can doodle to their hearts'
content. (Two-foot-by-two-foot squares in this so-called Michelangelo
Gallery rent for $10, and the proceeds go to the Bella Via Fund,
which raises money for arts projects in Santa Clarita Valley
schools.) The free entertainment options range from face painting to
cartooning--watch professional animators draw the Powerpuff Girls for
you--to two stages of opera singing.</TE>
<TE>   Once dusk descends on the first day of the festival, about two
dozen local restaurateurs wheel out samples of their choice eats in a
gourmet affair dubbed Slice of Valencia. Among the participants is
Cafe Melisse, the snazzy California French bistro that is the
Valencia cousin of Santa Monica's Melisse. It's planning to unload a
selection of pizzas--one topped with chicken bits, smoked gouda and
veggies, another a simple margherita with oven-dried tomatoes and
roasted garlic.</TE>
<TE>   Street painting originated in 16th century Italy, when
entertainment was scant and much excitement would greet itinerant
artists called madonnari, who stopped in town squares to draw
reproductions of Madonna paintings on the ground. Spectators gathered
to watch them work and occasionally threw coins on their drawings. At
the end of the day, the artists would pack up and leave for the next
town, and the chalk paintings would remain behind until the next
rain, or the scuffle of feet, erased them. (After the festival wraps
up on Sunday, the chalk drawings are typically erased by Tuesday
morning so the street can reopen to traffic. Says director Maglione,
"It would be heart-breaking to drive over them.")</TE>
<TE>   There are about five similar events statewide and a dozen across
the nation. Bella Via came about when Newhall Land, a real estate
developer from Valencia, sought to generate some ka-boom for the
opening of a new mall in 1999. Since then, the number of
participating artists and spectators has steadily increased. This
year, about 150 chalk painters are expected to trickle in from
California and beyond.</TE>
<TE>   There is something powerful about the symbolism of creating a
transitory work of art, street painter Kirk says. "It's one of the
things that street artists who do this regularly really enjoy about
it: the fact that it is a temporary thing. With most of us, it really
is about the act of creating something, rather than a material end.
We think of it as performance art."</TE>

<HD>Camel Beats Rock on the 'Scorpion' DVD</HD>
<DH></DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The most enjoyable part of the DVD of the Rock's sword-and-sandal
epic "The Scorpion King" (Universal, $20) is its animal outtakes.</LD>
<LD>   Although the Rock and his white camel seem to have a strong bond
on screen, off screen the dromedary was a bit persnickety. There are
several funny scenes in which the camel throws off the Rock and
co-star Kelly Hu and stubbornly refuses to obey his trainer. There's
also a very amusing scene in which hulking Michael Clarke Duncan has
a difficult time trying to mount his horse during the film's finale.</LD>
<LD>   Available in both wide-screen and pan-and-scan, the digital
edition of the box-office hit features decent commentary from
director Chuck Russell, rather ho-hum commentary from the Rock (he
also appears on screen during his commentary), an extended version of
the action adventure in an enhanced viewing mode that allows one to
watch alternate scenes, a look at how a fight sequence was
choreographed and documentaries on special effects and production
design. The DVD-ROM offers a plethora of additional behind-the-scenes
footage, more commentaries, deleted scenes, storyboards and games.</LD>
<TE>   In connection with "The Scorpion King," Universal is also
releasing the animated "The Mummy: Quest for the Lost Scrolls" ($10
for VHS; $20 for DVD), a feature-length version of the Kids' WB!
Saturday-morning series.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   If your tastes run to the more esoteric than wrestlers wielding
swords in ancient Egypt, then the "Beckett on Film" DVD gift set
(Ambrose Video, $150) is a must. This terrific compilation includes
all 19 of Samuel Beckett's plays, including "Waiting for Godot,"
"Endgame" and "Krapp's Last Tape."</TE>
<TE>   Among the highlights are John Gielgud, Harold Pinter and Rebecca
Pidgeon in "Catastrophe," directed by David Mamet; Jeremy Irons in a
dual role in the haunting "Ohio Impromptu"; Julianne Moore--or
rather, a close-up of her mouth--in "Not I," directed by Neil Jordan;
the wonderful Irish actors David Kelly and Milo O'Shea in "Rough for
Theater I"; and Alan Rickman, Kristin Scott Thomas and Juliet
Stevenson in "Play," directed by Anthony Minghella.</TE>
<TE>   Featured on the discs are information about each play and
interviews with several of the directors. There's also a documentary
on the making of the films.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Alfred Hitchcock's delectable, sexy psychological thriller
"Spellbound" (1945) enters the digital world thanks to Criterion
($40). Ingrid Bergman and Gregory Peck star in this romance about
mistaken identities and psychoanalysis. The film is known for its
evocative Oscar-winning score by Miklos Rozsa and a bizarre dream
sequence designed by Salvador Dali.</TE>
<TE>   The DVD features a gorgeous new digital transfer with film and
sound restoration (including the theater entrance and exit music
cues), rather kinky commentary by Hitchcock scholar Marian Keane that
is too steeped in Freudianism, an essay on the Dali sequences by
James Bigwood, the 1948 Lux Radio Theatre adaptation of the movie
with Joseph Cotten and Alida Valli, excerpts from a 1973 audio
interview with Rozsa, the trailer, essays by several Hitchcock
scholars and hundreds of photos and documents regarding the
production.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   New from Kino is the frightfully good "German Horror Classics"
collection ($24 each on either VHS or DVD; $90 for the DVD boxed
set). It features four of the spookiest silent horror films from
Germany: "Nosferatu," "The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari," "The Golem" and
"Waxworks." Each film has been mastered from the best archival
material, and each DVD has extras.</TE>

<AU>JOSEF WOODARD</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>For several years now, the gallery known as SCIAC (Studio Channel
Islands Art Center) has been making good use of its ample gallery and
studio space while the former Camarillo State Hospital site was
readied for its new life as California State University Channel
Islands.</LD>
<LD>   Now the fledgling university has caught up with the gallery, and
the current exhibition is a timely convergence of acronyms.</LD>
<LD>   CSUCI art faculty head Jack Reilly, at Cal State Northridge for
many years, is featured in the main gallery, with samplings of other
adjunct faculty members' work in the back gallery.</LD>
<TE>   Forget what you find on the surfaces of Reilly's art, the
picturesque landscape references and freewheeling allusions to art
history amid other scattershot elements. In various ways, this work,
drawn from his art over the years, is about the idea of being "about"
something beyond what is immediately apparent.</TE>
<TE>   An art-about-art attitude often is at work, in which he juxtaposes
and borrows imagery with a postmodernist spin all his own. Mixing
painting with relief and assemblage media, he literally piles high
and crosshatches references, to the point where a sense of a center
is sometimes blurry.</TE>
<TE>   "Apres le Dejeuner (sur l'herb)" takes aim, broadly, at Manet,
with its image of a reclining female nude in a landscape touching on
both Manet's famous painting of half-clad picnickers as well as his
famous courtesan portrait, "Olympia." Art, cultural ideals and
ecology blend in his "Endangered Landscape" series as he craftily
mixes idyllic landscape scenes with askew, gilded frames. These are
laid atop foundations whose murky, tactile bases suggest fossilized
garbage.</TE>
<TE>   His "Fusion Series" pushes his basic ideals into a logical new
visual scheme. Square canvases, painted and treated in disparate
ways, are joined to create complex shaped canvases that are all about
the parts rather than a definable whole. Contemporary data overload
may be the central theme in the series, with titles such as "Anxiety
of Idealism" and "Origin of Trepidation." From the evidence in this
show, Reilly's art is obviously in a process of continued change and
reinvention.</TE>
<TE>   * Jack Reilly, "Paintings Past and Present," Studio Channel
Islands Art Center, CSU Channel Islands, Camarillo. Ends Nov. 9.
Thursdays-Saturdays, noon-3 p.m. (805) 383-1368.</TE>
<TE>   Rubiconography: Ventura's claim to theater fame, the Rubicon
Theatre Company, is opening its new season gently, tunefully.
Following in the footsteps of last season's vintage American musical
"High Button Shoes," the Rubicon is presenting "Tintypes," a
compendium of turn-of-the-century songs, as a "preseason musical."
Tunes by Sousa, Gershwin, Stephen Foster and George M. Cohan dot the
Tony-nominated show.</TE>
<TE>   This production is directed by Bonnie Hellman with musical
direction by David Potter, both also responsible for "High Button
Shoes."</TE>
<TE>   The cast includes Greg Zerkle as Teddy Roosevelt and Darlesia
Cearcy, Broadway players both.</TE>
<TE>   * "Tintypes," Rubicon at the Laurel, 1006 E. Main St., Ventura.
Wednesdays-Saturdays, 8 p.m.; Sundays, 2 p.m. Ends Oct. 20. $28-$43.
(805) 667-2900. www.rubicontheatre.com.</TE>
<TE>   Noontime Sounds: To inaugurate a new series of Town Concerts, the
Ventura Master Chorale is presenting the premiere of a new piece by
Ventura composer Ross Care, in a free lunchtime concert at the
Ventura County Museum of History and Art on Friday.</TE>
<TE>   Care, who penned the original music for the Rubicon's production
of "Glass Menagerie," has written a piece titled "Sacred Harp."</TE>
<TE>   The piece will be performed by Marcia Dickstein, a noted Los
Angeles-based harp soloist, along with the chorale's Master Singers
and instrumentalists, led by chorale director Burns Taft. The new
Town Concerts series, timed to coincide with California Arts Day,
continues with encore performances of Care's music in December and
March.</TE>
<TE>   * "Sacred Harp" by Ross Care, Friday at 12:15 p.m., Ventura County
Museum of History and Art, 100 E. Main St., Ventura. (805) 653-0323.</TE>

<HD>Feds Subpoena Firm Controlled by News Corp.</HD>
<DH>Technology: Documents are requested from smart-card
developer NDS amid allegations of corporate sabotage.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID STREITFELD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>NDS Group, a company controlled by Rupert Murdoch's News Corp., was
hit with 31 grand jury subpoenas Wednesday in a federal probe
involving allegations of high-tech sabotage.</LD>
<LD>   NDS, a British company whose U.S. offices are in Newport Beach,
makes smart cards that prevent piracy of digital television signals.
The company's cards are used in 27 million television sets worldwide.
The federal criminal probe, and a separate civil suit, involve
allegations that NDS hacked competitors' cards, abetting widespread
piracy.</LD>
<LD>   An NDS spokeswoman said Wednesday that the company would cooperate
fully with the government's investigation.</LD>
<TE>   A Justice Department spokesman declined to comment. The subpoenas
demand that the company hand over a variety of documents.</TE>
<TE>   NDS was sued in March by a competing smart-card developer, Canal
Plus Technologies. Last week, two other companies, EchoStar
Communications Corp. and NagraStar, filed papers in U.S. District
Court in San Francisco declaring they intended to join the suit.</TE>
<TE>   News Corp., which owns 80% of NDS, has been trying to get the case
dismissed or dropped. This week, it announced a new deal with Canal
Plus' parent, troubled French media company Vivendi Universal, to buy
Vivendi's Italian pay-TV system. One clause in the deal: The lawsuit
dies.</TE>
<TE>   That is looking increasingly unlikely, however, because of the
government inquiry and the widening civil suit.</TE>
<TE>   The case, experts say, moves to the forefront the issue of whether
companies can be electronically secure in a world where hacking is
all too easy--and often untraceable. The financial stakes are high.
Canal Plus, for example, is seeking $1 billion in damages.</TE>
<TE>   "None of these allegations are surprising. All the pieces are out
there to do things like this," said computer security consultant
Bruce Schneier. "This is a harbinger of things to come."</TE>
<TE>   The allegations rank among the biggest public accusations ever of
intellectual property theft, experts said. In 2001, according to the
Trends in Proprietary Information Loss Survey, 40% of the companies
responding reported the theft, loss, destruction or misappropriation
of their intellectual property. Total reported losses were $56
billion to $59 billion.</TE>
<TE>   The entertainment and technology industries have been watching the
case with particular interest. Television is moving quickly toward
digital delivery, which offers both superior images and improved
reception over the traditional analog transmissions.</TE>
<TE>   To restrict access to authorized viewers, digital systems will
need to scramble their transmissions. Only customers with paid-up
smart cards will be able to get a clear signal. That's the plan, but
the economics will get murky if consumers find it cheaper to buy
counterfeit cards. Many viewers have been doing exactly that. In the
U.S., EchoStar and DirecTV count about 18 million subscribers--and 1
million pirates.</TE>
<TE>   Federal investigators first became interested in NDS late in 2000
when one of the company's engineers, Christopher Tarnovsky, was
informed by police that he had received two packages at a commercial
mailbox he rented in San Marcos, Texas. According to court documents,
one package contained a DVD player that had $20,000 hidden inside;
the other contained a CD player that had a hidden $20,100. The
packages were mailed from Canada.</TE>
<TE>   Tarnovsky's lawyer believes he was set up.</TE>
<TE>   "That is the only theory that makes sense," said San Diego
attorney Pamela Naughton. No charges have been filed in the matter.
Naughton said she hadn't seen the subpoenas issued Wednesday. "The
government is being used as a tool by the people who want to bring
down NDS for their own personal financial reasons," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Tarnovsky is the central figure in the civil case. Canal Plus and,
more extensively, EchoStar and NagraStar allege that NDS hacked their
encryption systems and Tarnovsky then transmitted their secret codes
to a Canadian Web site frequented by digital pirates. NDS denied in
court that Tarnovsky transmitted the codes, as did Naughton.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't believe there is any evidence he was responsible for
posting any codes, and there is no proof," she said.</TE>
<TE>   NDS' goal, the plaintiffs in the civil case allege, was to weaken
its competitors. At one point, NDS was on the verge of losing a
contract to NagraStar, court filings claim. So NDS hacked the Nagra-
Star system, encouraging a host of pirates and discouraging a TV
system customer from switching services, the filings claim.</TE>
<TE>   EchoStar and NagraStar asked the court to protect all documents
filed and depositions taken in the case, even if Canal Plus were to
drop out. Vivendi is selling Canal Plus to consumer electronics maker
Thomson Multimedia for $186 million. It was unknown whether Thomson
would have any interest in keeping the suit alive.</TE>
<TE>   EchoStar, the second-largest U.S. satellite TV company, is
struggling to salvage its takeover of the largest, DirecTV, a unit of
Hughes Electronics Corp. NagraStar is a joint venture of EchoStar and
Switzerland's Kudelski Group, another major smart-card developer.</TE>
<TE>   NDS Chief Executive Abe Peled said Monday that the new allegations
by EchoStar and NagraStar were "basically a repetition" of Canal
Plus' "groundless lawsuit" and "an attempt to harm NDS and thwart
legitimate competition."</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, NDS is the defendant in another suit, filed last month
by DirecTV, which hired NDS in 1999 to provide smart-card encryption
for its 11 million customers.</TE>
<TE>   The sealed lawsuit accuses NDS of breach of contract, fraud,
breach of warranty and misappropriation of trade secrets, DirecTV
said. NDS denies the charges.</TE>
<TE>   As part of its attempt to get the civil case dismissed, NDS in
August asked U.S. District Judge Vaughn Walker for a preliminary
injunction, a request that he called "almost silly" in court.</TE>
<TE>   "You haven't even come close" to establishing the legal grounds
for an injunction, Walker told NDS lawyers. Those grounds include a
likelihood that NDS would prevail in the case. "No way in the world I
can make a declaration on the record that you're likely to prevail,"
the judge said. "You're dead right out of the box."</TE>
<TE>   Over the protests of NDS lawyers, the judge allowed depositions to
proceed. Two weeks ago, Canal Plus lawyers deposed NDS chief Peled as
well as the company's security chief and a key engineer.</TE>
<TE>   Digital pirates frequently bought their counterfeit cards in
Canada, where it was legal to pirate American broadcasts until last
spring. Reprogrammed cards were sold openly in border cities. Even
now, after a Canadian Supreme Court ruling that made the piracy
illegal, trade is still brisk, if more clandestine.</TE>
<TE>   In Europe, piracy is even worse. AEPOC, the European anti-piracy
group, estimates that viewers there spend about $1 billion a year on
pirated television. Legitimate revenue is about $5 billion.</TE>
<TE>   "There is a general attitude that piracy is not a crime,
particularly in Italy," said Davide Rossi, the group's
secretary-general.</TE>
<TE>   Telepiu, one of the two Italian pay-TV systems, had as many as
three freeloaders for every one paying customer. Partly as a result,
Telepiu lost about $200 million in 2001. That proved a big drain on
its owner, Vivendi, which announced a deal in June to sell Telepiu to
News Corp., owner of the other platform. Negotiations faltered over
the summer but now seem to have been finalized.</TE>

<HD>ABC Proposes Pact With Affiliated Stations on Programming,
Costs</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MEG JAMES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>ABC said Wednesday that the network has proposed a two-year agreement
that calls for its affiliated stations to help pay for "Monday Night
Football," while limiting the reuse of ABC programming on Walt Disney
Co.'s various cable networks.</LD>
<LD>   Disney's ABC had a three-year pact with its affiliated stations
that expired at the end of July. But the two sides continued to meet
to hammer out contentious issues such as "repurposing" ABC shows, or
repeating programs on cable within days of their initial network
broadcast. This has been a major part of Disney's strategy to promote
ABC Family, the cable network that Disney acquired last year.</LD>
<LD>   Affiliate station groups must now individually approve the
agreement with the network. ABC affiliates include Hearst-Argyle
Television, Scripps Howard Broadcasting, Cox Broadcasting and Belo
Corp. The ABC affiliate board represents 35% of the affiliated
station groups and does not include ABC-owned stations.</LD>
<TE>   The stations agreed to pay $34 million a year to help ABC cover
its unprofitable National Football League contract, which costs the
network an average of $550 million a year. Stations in larger markets
also agreed to pick up a greater share of the costs to help smaller
market stations, one source said. ABC's "Monday Night Football"
contract is in the sixth year of an eight-year contract.</TE>
<TE>   The two sides "took a comprehensive look at our relationship,"
said ABC network President Alex Wallau. "Getting language that we
could all agree on was the challenge. But the fact that we did get a
deal done was very good for both of us."</TE>

<HD>AMD Cuts Forecast, Warns of Heavy Loss</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GLENDA McCARTHY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Citing continued weakness in personal computer sales, Advanced Micro
Devices Inc. slashed its revenue forecast Wednesday and warned of a
substantial loss for the third quarter.</LD>
<LD>   The maker of Athlon and Duron processors now expects sales of
about $500 million for the quarter, rather than the slightly more
than $600 million it forecast in July.</LD>
<LD>   Analysts had been expecting AMD to report a loss of 49 cents a
share on sales of $614 million for the quarter ended Sunday,
according to Thomson First Call.</LD>
<TE>   The Sunnyvale, Calif.-based chip maker has cut inventories of its
processors, which resulted in reduced unit sales, prices and overall
revenue, Chief Financial Officer Robert Rivet said.</TE>
<TE>   Sales of flash memory chips used in cellular phones and other
digital devices continue to improve, he said.</TE>
<TE>   AMD's announcement was hardly a surprise given the weakness in the
PC sector and the slowdown in technology spending, said Douglas Lee,
an analyst with Banc of America Securities, which does not own AMD
shares or do business with the company.</TE>
<TE>   But the warning underscores that AMD's market position is much
weaker than that of industry leader Intel Corp., Lee said.</TE>
<TE>   Shares of AMD dropped 79 cents, or nearly 15%, in extended trading
Wednesday. Before the announcement, the shares closed up 10 cents at
$5.37 on the New York Stock Exchange.</TE>
<TE>   AMD will release its third-quarter results Oct. 16.</TE>
<TE>   AMD's announcement came a day after a trade group said August chip
sales showed signs of a broad-based improvement. Worldwide sales rose
14% to $11.7 billion from August 2001, the first double-digit
increase since the industry's low point in 2001, the Semiconductor
Industry Assn. said.</TE>
<TE>   Strong growth in sales of chips for mobile phones was a major
factor, but the figure also reflected a traditional pickup in PC chip
sales in anticipation of back-to-school and holiday sales.</TE>
<TE>   But Lee offered a less optimistic view of the industry:
"Everyone's trying to catch the falling knife."</TE>

<HD>Comerica Shares Fall on Revised Earnings</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>E. SCOTT RECKARD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Comerica Inc., a Detroit bank with 25% of its assets in California,
surprised Wall Street on Wednesday when it sharply increased its
provisions for loan losses, restated its second-quarter results and
said it would take an $86-million charge to reflect the falling value
of its asset-management subsidiary.</LD>
<LD>   The news slammed Comerica's stock, which fell $10.19, or 20%, to
$40 on the New York Stock Exchange.</LD>
<LD>   In restating its second-quarter results, Comerica added $40
million in charges for bad loans. It said the move resulted from
discussions with state and federal regulators after their annual
examination of its California operations. Of the $40 million, $22
million was related to loans to independent movie producers, Comerica
Chief Financial Officer Elizabeth Acton said.</LD>
<TE>   The bank said it also will add $207 million in provisions for loan
losses in the third quarter, reflecting problems in joint lending
with other banks to major corporations and poorer-than-expected
economies in all its major markets.</TE>
<TE>   "Our assessment of the economy today is a fair bit more negative
than a few months ago," Acton said, citing weakness in retail,
manufacturing and some service and technology businesses.</TE>
<TE>   Comerica lowered the value of its Munder Capital Management unit
by $86 million because the firm is now worth less than what the bank
paid for it.</TE>
<TE>   Though it inherited problem loans when it bought Inglewood-based
Imperial Bank two years ago, Comerica is a well-regarded
"super-regional" bank, and its disclosures surprised the industry.</TE>
<TE>   The announcement, combined with a Bank of New York Co. profit
warning and analysts' reduced expectations for big investment banks,
drove other bank stocks down sharply. City National Corp. in Beverly
Hills fell by $3.18 to $44.82, a 6.6% decline, while UnionBanCal
Corp. in San Francisco was down $2.45 at $40.80, or 5.6%, both on the
NYSE.</TE>
<TE>   UnionBanCal Vice Chairman Richard C. Hartnack, a director of the
Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, said he has seen no increase
in regulators' scrutiny of banks.</TE>
<TE>   "Based on my experience, this doesn't portend any dramatic
follow-on announcements from other institutions," Hartnack said.</TE>

<HD>Bills to Back Consumers' Media Rights</HD>

<SE></SE>
<AU>JON HEALEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>After watching the entertainment industry's anti-piracy agenda
dominate Capitol Hill all year, allies of the consumer-electronics
and technology industries are firing back with bills to ensure that
consumers can make copies for personal use.</LD>
<LD>   The two bills by Reps. Zoe Lofgren (D-San Jose) and Rick Boucher
(D-Va.) are landing too late to pass this session, but supporters say
that's not the point. They say the legislation is designed to frame
the debate for next year, when the entertainment industry renews its
drive for tougher copyright protections.</LD>
<LD>   The bills would amend a provision of the 1998 Digital Millennium
Copyright Act that makes it illegal to pick the electronic locks on
copyrighted works. Lofgren and Boucher's bills would allow consumers
to circumvent those locks to make backup copies or other "fair uses"
of works they own.</LD>
<TE>   "This bill will be strongly opposed by the Motion Picture Assn.,
the record labels and the book publishers, I have no doubt about
that," Boucher said of the legislation he expects to introduce today
with Rep. John T. Doolittle (R-Rocklin). "And I'm looking forward to
the debate."</TE>
<TE>   Among the companies and groups backing Boucher are Intel Corp.,
Sun Microsystems Inc., Verizon Communications Inc., the American
Library Assn. and Consumers Union.</TE>
<TE>   Congress has held hearings on copyright issues but the focus has
been on Internet-fueled piracy. Four influential lawmakers, including
three committee chairmen, floated bills that would have given
copyright owners more powerful tools to fight piracy, drawing
criticism from manufacturers and consumer groups.</TE>

felony domestic violence, San Mateo County Deputy Dist. Atty. Sheryl
Wolcott said.</LD>
<LD>   Johnson pleaded not guilty Monday to domestic violence, witness
intimidation and other charges and is free on $150,000 bail, the San
Francisco Chronicle reported. His wife suffered a broken eye orbital
bone, Wolcott said.</LD>
<TE>   Neither Johnson nor his attorney could not be reached for comment.
Johnson's duties will be assumed by his brother Greg and Martin

<HD>Winnick's Pledge a $25-Million Surprise</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELIZABETH DOUGLASS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It was after Gary Winnick heard an employee tell a congressional
panel that she had lost her retirement savings--all $86,000 of
it--that the chairman of Global Crossing Ltd. resolved to shore up
his company's sagging employee retirement fund with his own money.</LD>
<LD>   At least that's what a Winnick aide said Wednesday, a day after
his surprise promise to contribute $25 million to Global Crossing's
401(k) plan.</LD>
<LD>   The move caught even his own attorneys off guard, and many
unanswered questions remained Wednesday as Winnick tried to make good
on the vow.</LD>
<TE>   "He didn't have a plan, but he was just so moved by the woman's
testimony," the Winnick aide said. "I think he surprised himself."</TE>
<TE>   Winnick told the House Energy and Commerce Committee's oversight
and investigations panel that he intended to write a check to the
administrator of the company's retirement plan, which lost more than
$250 million of its value as the telecommunications company buckled
under an industrywide slump. Global Crossing filed for bankruptcy
protection in January.</TE>
<TE>   The money is to be divided among the employee participants based
on the amount they invested in the plan after 1999. How many
employees that would affect was unclear. Winnick says 14,000. A law
firm suing on behalf of 401(k) participants says it could be as high
as 16,000 or 18,000.</TE>
<TE>   Also unclear is whether any of Global Crossing's executives will
get any of the money.</TE>
<TE>   Winnick's spokeswoman said those and other details are being
worked out and that the Bel-Air resident wants his promise "to be
acted on as soon as possible."</TE>
<TE>   Winnick's attorneys and others say the contribution was first
discussed several months ago, but the idea was tabled after advisors
warned that it could be taken as a tacit admission of guilt or be
dismissed as a public relations stunt.</TE>
<TE>   But something changed during Tuesday's hearing, where Winnick and
others were set to discuss allegations that Global Crossing used sham
transactions to help hide the company's deteriorating condition while
executives sold shares.</TE>
<TE>   Winnick hadn't expected to hear about Lenette Crumpler, who is
single with two children. Testifying in the presence of Winnick and
other current and former Global Crossing executives, Crumpler said
she spent 31 years in the phone business but now has little to show
for it. Her $86,000 401(k) fund, largely invested in Global Crossing
stock, was wiped out.</TE>
<TE>   Many current and former workers have welcomed Winnick's move, his
spokeswoman said. Critics have reacted with contempt.</TE>
<TE>   "Here's a guy who is worth a billion dollars, and he has just
agreed to pay less than 1% of what he's worth," said Lynn Sarko, an
attorney handling several lawsuits over Global Crossing's retirement
plan. "He's off by a magnitude of 10."</TE>

<HD>Dot-Com Clients Got Hot '90s IPOs</HD>
<DH>Securities: Documents show Goldman Sachs allocated
offerings to certain execs. The firm denies wrongdoing.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>WALTER HAMILTON and DEBORA VRANA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Congressional investigators released new information Wednesday on
brokerages' allocations of hot new-stock issues to favored clients,
including California dot-com executives who in some cases received
shares in more than 100 deals in the late 1990s.</LD>
<LD>   Meanwhile, state and federal regulators met in New York, seeking
to overcome differences and form a united front in talks to reach a
broad settlement of conflict-of-interest charges against securities
firms, sources said.</LD>
<LD>   Documents made public by the House Financial Services Committee
showed that executives at a host of Internet firms, including San
Jose-based EBay Inc. and Sunnyvale-based Yahoo Inc., were awarded
shares of coveted initial public stock offerings from brokerage
Goldman Sachs Group Inc.</LD>
<TE>   EBay Chief Executive Meg Whitman and Yahoo co-founder Jerry Yang
each received shares in more than 100 Goldman-sponsored IPOs during
the bull market, according to the documents.</TE>
<TE>   Edward "Toby" Lenk, founder of now-defunct EToys Inc. of Santa
Monica, got shares in more than 25 Goldman IPOs, investigators said.</TE>
<TE>   More than two dozen other corporate executives are named in the
documents as having received IPO shares from Goldman.</TE>
<TE>   IPO allocations from brokerages to corporate executives have drawn
intense scrutiny from regulators, who have alleged that the shares
often were awarded in the hope that the executives then would steer
corporate-finance work to the brokerages. The practice is known as
"spinning."</TE>
<TE>   "While some of this may not be illegal, it's clearly
unacceptable," said Peggy Peterson, a committee spokeswoman.</TE>
<TE>   A Goldman spokesman confirmed that the firm allocated shares to
the executives named but denied wrongdoing.</TE>
<TE>   "We think this is an egregious distortion of the facts," the
spokesman said. "The suggestion that Goldman Sachs was involved in
spinning or other inappropriate practices connected with IPO
allocations is simply wrong."</TE>
<TE>   The documents did not reveal any profits that the executives made
in the deals. However, many sold their shares shortly after receiving
them, often the same day, the committee said. Given the fantastic
price increases of IPOs in the late 1990s, some executives made
"large percentage gains," the committee said.</TE>
<TE>   Rep. Michael Oxley (R-Ohio), the committee chairman, does not
favor legislation to change IPO practices, Peterson said. But Oxley
will discuss his findings with regulators and with brokerages in an
effort to change industry practices, Peterson said.</TE>
<TE>   "There is no equity in the equities markets," Oxley said. "I call
on every Wall Street firm to show respect for America's individual
investors by reforming these corrupt practices immediately."</TE>
<TE>   The committee released documents in August showing that several
telecom industry executives, including Bernard J. Ebbers, former CEO
of WorldCom Inc., reaped millions on IPOs allocated to them by
Salomon Smith Barney, a unit of Citigroup Inc. Ebbers also received
IPO shares from Goldman, though the committee did not provide
details.</TE>
<TE>   On Monday, New York Atty. Gen. Eliot Spitzer sued Ebbers and four
other telecom executives, alleging that they were given IPO shares in
return for steering fee-rich banking business to Salomon.</TE>
<TE>   The committee report Wednesday stemmed from Oxley's request last
month that Goldman and Credit Suisse First Boston also supply details
on their IPO distributions. The committee still is sifting through
the CSFB information, Peterson said.</TE>
<TE>   "We continue to support governmental and regulatory authorities as
we all work together on initiatives to restore investor confidence,"
CSFB said.</TE>
<TE>   The documents released Wednesday showed that executives across a
wide spectrum of industries received IPO shares from Goldman. The
report also listed the investment banking fees the executives'
companies paid to Goldman since 1996.</TE>
<TE>   Several executives and directors of fiber-optic firm Global
Crossing Ltd., including CEO John Legere, got Goldman IPOs.</TE>
<TE>   Also, Michael Eisner, Walt Disney Co. CEO, got 30,000 of Goldman's
own stock when the brokerage went public in 1999.</TE>
<TE>   Global Crossing spokeswoman Tisha Kresler said that Legere was
traveling in Europe and that she couldn't comment on the report.</TE>
<TE>   Disney spokesman John Spelich said Eisner has had personal assets
managed by Goldman since 1989. "I think it's important to note that
this was a direct offering made to a client of the firm, not a
third-party offering" of stock, Spelich said.</TE>
<TE>   An EBay spokesman declined to comment on Whitman's stock
allocations. At Yahoo, the company issued a statement saying "Yahoo
executives who received pre-IPO stock did so through private banking
transactions which Yahoo was not involved in."</TE>
<TE>   Lenk, who was CEO of EToys, could not be reached for comment.</TE>
<TE>   Goldman was the primary investment banker involved in the initial
stock offerings of EBay, Yahoo and EToys in the late 1990s.</TE>
<TE>   The committee also released data showing that Enron Corp.
officials received IPO allocations from Goldman.</TE>
<TE>   Kenneth Lay, former Enron chairman, got 23 IPOs. Herb Winokur, an
Enron director, was part of more than 50 deals, while Robert Belfer,
another board member, took part in more than 40 offerings, the
committee said. Goldman earned $19 million in investment-banking fees
from Enron since 1996, the report said.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, state and federal securities regulators worked
Wednesday to hammer out a common position in their talks with Wall
Street over settling their myriad investigations of alleged
wrongdoing, sources said.</TE>
<TE>   Besides IPO spinning, regulators also are studying whether
brokerage analysts publicly hyped stocks of certain companies
primarily to curry favor with the firms.</TE>
<TE>   The Securities and Exchange Commission and other federal
regulators had a settlement meeting last week with lawyers for
Salomon. The brokerage's attorneys met separately a day earlier with
Spitzer, whose investigation into brokerage practices is widely
viewed as the most aggressive.</TE>
<TE>   SEC Chairman Harvey Pitt called Spitzer on Tuesday and the two men
met that night in New York, according to a source. Pitt asked Spitzer
to team with other regulators in working toward a "global" settlement
with multiple investment banks.</TE>
<TE>   Spitzer agreed on the condition that the regulators push for a
tough settlement that would force meaningful changes in Wall Street
practices, the source said.</TE>
<TE>   Spitzer in the past has suggested that brokerages must formally
separate research from investment banking, so analysts can't be
influenced by bankers.</TE>
<TE>   Pitt has pushed the idea of a broad settlement in which all major
investment banks would agree to wide-ranging reforms as a way to
resolve the multiple investigations.</TE>
<TE>   Salomon has favored a universal settlement, but some other firms
have been lukewarm to the idea.</TE>
<TE>   An announcement regarding cooperation between state and federal
regulators is expected today, sources said.</TE>

<HD>Stocks Retreat as Worries Mount</HD>
<DH>Wall Street: Earnings warnings and fears of war send the
Dow down 2.3%. The West Coast port shutdown contributes to decline.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Stocks sank at the end of a seesaw session Wednesday as gnawing
worries over corporate earnings and the threat of war eroded the
previous day's fat rally.</LD>
<LD>   Tuesday's 346-point gain by the Dow industrials "wasn't a sign of
things to come," said Rafael Tamargo, director of research at
Wilmington Trust Co. That rally was driven by a smattering of
positive corporate profit reports and news of an agreement that would
allow United Nations weapons inspectors back into Iraq.</LD>
<LD>   An earnings warning Wednesday from Dow Chemical and a downbeat
analyst report on Cisco Systems hurt stocks in the early going. A
tepid mid-session rally gave way to a wave of late selling after
President Bush warned that Iraq had limited time to comply with U.N.
resolutions and the use of force may be "unavoidable." Also weighing
on the markets was the continuing shutdown of the West Coast ports.</LD>
<TE>   The Dow ended the day down 183.18 points, or 2.3%, at 7,755.61.
That wiped out more than half of Tuesday's gain. The Standard &amp;
Poor's 500 index sank 20.00 points, or 2.4%, to 827.91. The
technology-laden Nasdaq composite index lost 26.42 points, or 2.2%,
to 1,187.30.</TE>
<TE>   Losers beat winners 2 to 1 on the New York Stock Exchange and
Nasdaq in active trading.</TE>
<TE>   Dow Chemical fell $2.55 to $27.25 after the second-largest U.S.
chemical company warned that third-quarter earnings will miss
expectations. Dow cited higher raw-material costs, mainly in Europe.
The warning helped push DuPont, a component of the Dow industrials,
down $2.32 to $37.31.</TE>
<TE>   Cisco, the most active stock on Nasdaq, slumped 89 cents to
$10.05--a loss of 8%. Wall Street brokerage UBS Warburg cut Cisco's
revenue forecasts and its price target to $14 from $15.50.</TE>
<TE>   UBS cited recent weakness in information technology spending, a
profit warning from rival Extreme Networks and softness in Japanese
and European markets. Extreme Networks tumbled 45 cents, or more than
11%, to $3.48.</TE>
<TE>   "Until we start to see some growth in earnings and revenue in some
of these companies, we're going to muddle along here," said Suzanne
Coleman, a money manager at David L. Babson &amp; Co.</TE>
<TE>   Railroad owner Burlington Northern Santa Fe fell $1.57 to $23.78
after saying the shutdown of West Coast ports would hurt profit.
Other rail and shipping stocks fell as the lockout of dockworkers
extended to a sixth day. Union Pacific, operator of the largest U.S.
railroad, dropped $3.63 to $56.65. Trucking company Roadway fell 51
cents to $36.91.</TE>
<TE>   Union leaders agreed late Wednesday to submit the dispute to
mediation, but the ports weren't expected to reopen today.</TE>
<TE>   Wall Street did get some good news from Dell Computer, which
lifted its earnings and sales forecasts after the market closed
Tuesday. Dell rose almost 3% Wednesday, adding 68 cents to $25.32.</TE>
<TE>   After markets closed, the NYSE announced a "clerical error" at
brokerage Bear Stearns resulted in orders to sell $4 billion of
stocks. The orders should have been entered as $4 million. The orders
were entered about 20 minutes before the closing bell, and all but
$622 million were canceled before execution.</TE>
<TE>   Bear Stearns said the error will have no material effect on the
company and declined to comment further. The NYSE said the sell
orders were for $4 billion worth of "S&amp;P securities" but didn't say
which stocks were affected.</TE>
<TE>   In other highlights:</TE>
<TE>   * Financial shares were hurt after Morgan Stanley cut share-price
expectations for Citigroup, Merrill Lynch and Lehman Bros. Merrill
fell $1.30 to $33.15, Lehman declined $1.75 to $49.14, and Citigroup
lost $1.40 to $29.60.</TE>
<TE>   * Computer services giant Electronic Data Systems lost $1.74, or
more than 11%, to $13.35. The company said it is cooperating with
regulators in an informal inquiry related to its recent surprise
profit warning and other issues.</TE>
<TE>   * Japan's benchmark stock index fell to a new 19-year low on
worries about bad bank loans. Bourses in Europe surged, rising 2.8%
in Britain, 4% in France and 2.2% in Germany.</TE>

<HD>Faneuil Pleads Guilty in Stewart Case</HD>
<DH>Probe: Merrill Lynch staffer admits taking a payoff to
mislead investigators on alleged insider trading.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PATRICIA HURTADO</AU>
<BD>NEWSDAY</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Douglas Faneuil, the boyish assistant to Martha Stewart's
stockbroker, pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor charge Wednesday,
admitting he was offered money, plane tickets and an extra week's
vacation to keep mum that Stewart had been tipped off to inside
information regarding her ImClone System Inc.'s shares.</LD>
<LD>   The plea by the Merrill Lynch broker assistant--signed with
federal prosecutors in the office of Manhattan U.S. Atty. James Comey
on Sept. 24--was part of a deal to testify in their investigation of
Stewart and her dumping of $228,000 worth of ImClone shares in
December.</LD>
<LD>   The homemaking celebrity sold her 3,928 shares of ImClone stocks
Dec. 27, just before the price nose-dived on news the Food and Drug
Administration would not approve its anti-cancer drug, Erbitux.</LD>
<TE>   Stewart has denied any wrongdoing in the sale of ImClone shares
and has maintained that she had a standing order with Faneuil's
supervisor, Peter Bacanovic, to sell the stock if the price went
below $60.</TE>
<TE>   Her friend Samuel Waksal, ImClone's former chief executive and
founder, was indicted in August for allegedly telling family members
to dump millions of dollars' worth of ImClone stock before the bad
news about Erbitux hit the market. He has pleaded not guilty.</TE>
<TE>   Faneuil, 27, contradicted Stewart's account Wednesday, telling
U.S. Magistrate Judge Kevin Fox that Bacanovic had "directly or
indirectly" told Stewart that Waksal family members had been selling
their ImClone stock and that Waksal also had attempted to sell off
his stock.</TE>
<TE>   Neither Stewart nor Bacanovic was named in the indictment, but the
misdemeanor case describes Faneuil's superior as a "Financial
Advisor" and Stewart as "the Tippee."</TE>
<TE>   Asked to identify "the Tippee," one of Faneuil's lawyers, Marvin
Pickholz, said, "If you guys read this information and you can't fill
in the blanks, you're in serious trouble."</TE>
<TE>   Stewart's spokeswoman, Allyn Magrino, declined to comment
Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   Merrill Lynch fired Faneuil and Bacanovic on Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   Merrill Lynch spokesman Bill Halldin indicated that Faneuil was
terminated because of his guilty plea, and Bacanovic was terminated
because "he has declined to cooperate with investigators."</TE>
<TE>   The former "client associate" described how he had accepted "a
percentage of the financial advisor commission" and had been offered
an extra week's vacation and airline tickets. Faneuil also admitted
to lying in a Jan. 3 interview with the Securities and Exchange
Commission and a March 7 interview with an SEC lawyer and an FBI
agent.</TE>
<TE>   Faneuil faces up to a year in prison for the charge and a minimum
fine of at least $100,000 when he is sentenced Jan. 7. But under the
plea deal, Faneuil probably will get probation.</TE>

<HD>MGM to Base Urban Clothing Line on Its Movies From '70s</HD>

<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When it comes to merchandising, Walt Disney Co. has Mickey Mouse and
Warner Bros. has Harry Potter. Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Inc. has something
decidedly different: Foxy Brown.</LD>
<LD>   The struggling studio is digging deep into its extensive film
library to license a clothing line inspired by black-oriented films
from the 1970s, including "Foxy Brown," "Cooley High" and "Coffey."
It's part of a strategy to market MGM merchandise to niche groups.</LD>
<LD>   In this case, the studio is hoping to sell to a hip, urban
audience. Future efforts could target fans of its western, science
fiction or horror titles.</LD>
<TE>   MGM is turning to the past because it hasn't produced the kinds of
blockbuster movies recently that translate easily into dolls,
lunchboxes and key chains.</TE>
<TE>   "One of the challenges we have is that we haven't in the past done
a lot of major theatrical releases that have big merchandising
campaigns," said Travis Rutherford, head of the consumer products
division at MGM.</TE>
<TE>   In its most recent quarter, MGM posted a net loss of $121.8
million. No one expects the merchandising plan to have a major effect
on that bottom line.</TE>
<TE>   MGM is targeting urban youths at mall specialty stores and hip-hop
clothing outlets in major cities.</TE>
<TE>   The first fruits of the strategy will be seen as urban clothing
company Willie Esco rolls out denim jackets and jeans, athletic gear,
sweatsuits and other items based on MGM's "Soul Cinema" collection.
The films include titles such as "Foxy Brown," "Hell Up in Harlem,"
"Black Caesar" and "Coffey."</TE>
<TE>   Most of the clothing items will carry the MGM logo only on a tag
or packaging. "It would be wrong for us to slap MGM on the product
itself," Rutherford said. "MGM means great movies, but it doesn't
necessarily mean a great fashion apparel line."</TE>

<HD>New Times Cuts Deal to Close L.A. Paper</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TIM RUTTEN and J. MICHAEL KENNEDY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Readers of alternative newspapers in Los Angeles have one less
alternative: New Times is dead.</LD>
<LD>   The paper was killed as a part of an arrangement negotiated in
secret by the nation's two leading alternative newspaper chains
during the last three months. The result looks very much like a good
old-fashioned capitalist deal--trading cash for markets. Legal
experts said the deal could raise antitrust issues.</LD>
<LD>   The Phoenix-based New Times chain agreed to close 6-year-old New
Times Los Angeles, ceding its Southern California niche to L.A.
Weekly, which is owned by New York-based Village Voice Media. In
exchange, Voice Media paid New Times a cash fee, which sources put at
more than $1 million. Voice Media also agreed to shut down its
Cleveland Free Times in consideration of a smaller cash payment from
New Times, leaving that city to the latter's Cleveland Scene.</LD>
<TE>   Both closures were immediate, and staff members were asked to
clean out their desks by midday Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   Michael Lacey, executive editor of the New Times chain, said 21 of
the Los Angeles paper's journalists and some of its advertising staff
are being offered jobs elsewhere in the chain. The paper's two film
critics will remain in Los Angeles on the company's payroll. Overall,
New Times Los Angeles employed about 70 people. Forty-eight workers
lost their jobs at the Cleveland Free Times.</TE>
<TE>   Executives at both shuttered papers said all workers, even those
who might be hired by other papers in the chains, have received
severance payments.</TE>
<TE>   New Times was an amalgam of entertainment journalism and bare-
knuckles cover stories and columns with a penchant for name-calling.</TE>
<TE>   Alex Ben Block, executive director of the Los Angeles Press Club's
board, decried the deal as one struck "for marginal economic gain by
two large, profitable corporations looking to cut costs in a
difficult business environment." New Times Los Angeles' closure, he
said in a statement, leaves the city "poorer in spirit and soul."</TE>
<TE>   Lacey informed the paper's writers and editors of the closure
Tuesday night at Shutters hotel in Santa Monica, where they had
gathered to attend what they thought was an editorial meeting.</TE>
<TE>   "None of us had an inkling of what was coming," said Managing
Editor Jack Cheevers, who will assume the same post at New Times' SF
Weekly.</TE>
<TE>   Lacey, according to New Times Editor Rick Barrs, said, "I'm sad to
say that the paper will cease publication with this issue. The
post-9/11 economy killed us. We just never recovered from the
advertising downturn after that. Mike ordered 20 bottles of wine and
we drank it all."</TE>
<TE>   Among those at Tuesday's meeting was Jill Stewart, the paper's
political columnist. She said she knew something was up when Lacey
ordered all 20 bottles of wine opened at once. "He said he was
literally sick to his stomach, that it was the worst thing he had to
do in all his life," she said.</TE>
<TE>   The deal left New Times with 11 weekly publications stretching
from Palm Beach, Fla., to San Francisco. Village Voice Media now
publishes seven alternative newspapers, the largest of which are L.A.
Weekly and New York's Village Voice. Both companies are privately
held.</TE>
<TE>   Talks between the chains' financial officers began in July and
concluded Monday, according to David Schneiderman, chief executive of
Voice Media. The money transfers occurred Tuesday afternoon, hours
before the closures were announced to selected members of the papers'
staffs.</TE>
<TE>   "It started with financial guys on both sides talking about the
problems in Cleveland," Schneiderman said. "It's a smallish market
where we were both at each other's necks. Then the discussions
expanded to Los Angeles. That essentially broke the impasse we had in
Cleveland, and Monday [New Times CEO] Jim Larkin and I signed off on
the deal."</TE>
<TE>   Neither Schneiderman nor Lacey would comment on the size of the
cash payments.</TE>
<TE>   Both Schneiderman and L.A. Weekly Publisher Beth Sestanovich said
they were unconcerned about the arrangement's antitrust implications,
because both Los Angeles and Cleveland retain numerous print and
broadcast outlets.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not as if we're leaving Los Angeles with one newspaper,"
Sestanovich said.</TE>
<TE>   Legal experts, however, were skeptical. "This could raise rather
interesting antitrust issues," said Don Hibner, an expert on
antitrust with law firm Sheppard, Mullin Richter &amp; Hampton. "On its
face, it doesn't seem right."</TE>
<TE>   Contracts or written agreements that reduce output or raise prices
are prohibited by the Sherman Antitrust Act. Even though both New
Times and the Weekly are distributed free, there probably will be an
increase in their advertising rates, Hibner said.</TE>
<TE>   "That's going to injure advertisers," he said. "They will likely
pay more and people will have less to read, that's a reduction of
output. It looks like they're agreeing to pay money to stop the other
guy from competing in their backyard. That's what antitrust laws are
designed to prevent."</TE>
<TE>   New Times Los Angeles employees were told that the doors of their
Westside office would close at noon Wednesday. One of those leaving
the building was Erika Ginter, a 26-year-old layout editor. When she
walked into the office Wednesday morning, it seemed like another work
day.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm totally, utterly amazed," she said. "We had no idea. We just
finished remodeling the office. They spent hundreds of thousands of
dollars remodeling, so it totally shocked us."</TE>
<TE>   By late Wednesday afternoon, New Times' Web site had disappeared,
replaced by the Web site of L.A. Weekly.</TE>

<LD>One of Orange County's largest office complexes, the
1.7-million-square-foot Park Place in Irvine, has been sold to an
affiliate of investment banking firm Blackstone Real Estate Advisors.</LD>
<LD>   The transaction, among the largest in Southern California this
year, was valued at about $200 million by a source close to one of
the parties.</LD>
<LD>   The Blackstone group purchased the sprawling office complex at
Jamboree Road and the San Diego Freeway from Jamboree, a
limited-liability corporation managed by Oaktree Capital Management.
The 14.7-acre compound built in 1978 once served as the headquarters
of engineering giant Fluor Corp. and consists of interconnected
buildings, including a 10-story, hexagonal tower that is a local
landmark.</LD>
<TE>   The property is more than 90% leased with such major tenants as
ConAgra Inc., the California Department of Transportation, Balboa
Insurance and Washington Mutual, said broker Insignia/ESG, which
represented the sellers.</TE>
<TE>   Fluor's 1999 move to Aliso Viejo left Park Place with 600,000
square feet of empty space, one of the county's largest single
vacancies ever.</TE>

<HD>Union Agrees to Federal Mediation, but West Coast Ports
Remain Closed</HD>
<DH>Labor: Maritime group wants assurance that there will be no
more work slowdowns before it agrees to allow offloading of ships.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAN WEIKEL and NANCY CLEELAND</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In a step toward reopening West Coast ports, the dockworkers union on
Wednesday agreed to let federal mediators help resolve a critical
contract dispute over the use of labor-saving technology at cargo
terminals.</LD>
<LD>   But the ports remained shuttered and were unlikely to open before
Friday at the earliest. The Pacific Maritime Assn. said it was not
ready to lift the lockout it imposed Sunday, stranding ships from San
Diego to Seattle, unless the union guaranteed that it would not
engage in work slowdowns.</LD>
<LD>   Without those assurances--which could be accomplished by the
International Longshore and Warehouse Union agreeing to extend its
expired contract--the shipping lines and terminal operators said they
could be forced to close the ports yet again.</LD>
<TE>   "If we went back up again and then shut it down again, we look
like a bunch of idiots," said Joseph Miniace, the maritime group's
president.</TE>
<TE>   Union spokesman Steve Stallone said the ILWU would not agree to
any conditions as it enters mediation, which is set to start today at
an undisclosed location in the San Francisco Bay Area.</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) called for President Bush to
invoke the Taft-Hartley Act, which would force the ports to reopen
during an 80-day cooling-off period, if the standoff isn't resolved
by the end of the week.</TE>
<TE>   "With our nation in the economic doldrums and at the brink of war,
we cannot afford to have this dispute cause further damage to our
economy," Feinstein said in a statement late Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   White House Press Secretary Ari Fleischer said Bush continues to
follow the labor dispute closely, but declined to speculate whether
or at what point the president would consider intervening. "The
administration continues to urge labor and management to come
together to get an agreement, because the longer this goes, the more
harm it will do to the economy," Fleischer said.</TE>
<TE>   As efforts to rekindle negotiations got underway, businesses
across the country, from toy manufacturers to automakers, continued
to suffer from the shutdown of the 29 West Coast ports.</TE>
<TE>   In Fremont, Calif., an auto assembly factory that makes Toyotas
and Pontiacs was forced to close for lack of parts. If ships continue
to pile up at West Coast ports, many of the nation's retailers say
they are looking at quickly deteriorating profits and thinly stocked
shelves this holiday season.</TE>
<TE>   Efforts to resolve the dispute suffered a setback Tuesday when
union representatives stormed out of a meeting with federal mediator
Peter J. Hurtgen in Oakland. They were angry because Miniace was
accompanied by armed bodyguards.</TE>
<TE>   The maritime group said the security was needed because Miniace
had received death threats, although Hurtgen said bringing guards to
a mediation session was a breach of protocol.</TE>
<TE>   On Wednesday, union officials met again with Hurtgen and described
the meeting as fruitful. Later in the day, the union announced that
it would accept mediation.</TE>
<TE>   "We felt we owed Mr. Hurtgen the opportunity to explain what he
had in mind even if PMA's inappropriate actions made [Tuesday's]
attempts at talks impossible," said ILWU International President
James Spinosa.</TE>
<TE>   For their part, executives in the highly competitive shipping
industry struggled to maintain a show of unity as the lockout dragged
on. Privately, several executives spoke of growing disagreement about
how hard to push for new technology--the most contentious issue in
the negotiations.</TE>
<TE>   Long before contract talks began in May, the maritime group said
it would not sign a contract without provisions for introducing bar
code scanners, remote cameras, satellite positioning devices and
other tools that would speed the flow of cargo. Such advances
jeopardize hundreds of union clerical jobs.</TE>
<TE>   The group pushed for such provisions during contract talks in 1996
and 1999, but gave up after the union staged slowdowns. Now some
within the employers group are again considering backing down on the
technology issue.</TE>
<TE>   "The employers are not feeling the same with respect to this
issue," one executive said.</TE>
<TE>   Another shipping line executive said some companies that have
managed to install technology aren't willing to push hard to allow
competitors to easily catch up.</TE>
<TE>   A third said he could not imagine a deal being signed without a
technology component, and said shipping companies would expect
federal intervention to eventually get the ports back open.</TE>
<TE>   The longshore union said last week that it wanted to take
technology off the table, in part because of mixed messages from the
employers group.</TE>
<TE>   "You see the difficulty we have of dealing with a group that
doesn't have agreement among its members," Stallone said. "Each one
is trying to tweak the deal in a different way that suits their
interests better. That's why we're saying put it aside."</TE>
<TE>   Miniace said, however, that although Pacific Maritime Assn. board
members may differ on specific needs for technology, they agree on
the need for a new framework for dealing with the union on how new
equipment will be introduced. "We have solid agreement on this
issue," he said.</TE>
<TE>   As the union and the employers continued to squabble, more ships
arrived off the coast.</TE>
<TE>   A survey of major West Coast ports indicates that at least 145
ships laden with electronics, food, auto parts and other goods await
unloading. Dozens more are scheduled to arrive in the next few days.</TE>
<TE>   In the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach, the third-largest port
complex in the world, at least 97 vessels were waiting to be unloaded
Wednesday and 30 more were scheduled to arrive in the next two days.</TE>
<TE>   Erik Autor, vice president and international trade counsel for the
National Retail Federation, said his members have lost "hundreds of
millions of dollars" in revenues and inventory costs.</TE>
<TE>   If the port lockdown continues, he said, retailers may be forced
to shut down distribution centers and furlough workers. "Excess
inventory is a cost that worsens every day," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The situation for some manufacturers is not much different.</TE>
<TE>   The Toyota Motor Corp.-General Motors Corp. joint venture in
Fremont shut down its assembly lines Wednesday because of a parts
shortage, disrupting production of Toyota Corolla sedans and Tacoma
pickups and Pontiac Vibe sport wagons.</TE>
<TE>   A spokesman for the venture, New United Motor Manufacturing Inc.,
said that if the ports were to reopen today, the passenger car line
could be running again by Friday morning. But it will be Monday at
least before pickup truck production could resume.</TE>
<TE>   Also Wednesday, a national federation of trucking companies joined
the ranks of business groups that have asked the White House to
mandate an end to the lockout.</TE>
<TE>   The American Trucking Assn. said in an open letter to Bush that
the lockout is threatening the nation's economy and security as
accumulating ships "enrich target opportunities for terrorists."</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, at Port Hueneme in Ventura County, police in riot gear
were called out Wednesday afternoon when picketing workers tried to
prevent a Del Monte ship carrying a load of bananas from leaving the
dock.</TE>
<TE>   Tensions boiled over about 2:30 p.m. when workers on the ship
tried to pull up the vessel's gangplank as it prepared to leave for
Ensenada.</TE>
<TE>   Angry pickets surrounded one ship worker and started pushing and
shoving him when he attempted to draw the ship's moorings.</TE>
<TE>   Dozens of Port Hueneme and Oxnard police officers, outfitted in
riot gear and armed with batons and pepper spray, descended on the
docks to restore order. No arrests were made. Del Monte officials
have decided to keep the ship at the dock for now.</TE>
<TE>   The Marine Exchange in Los Angeles estimates that since the
lockout began, shipping lines have diverted about 10 vessels from Los
Angeles-Long Beach, rerouting them to Mexican ports, the Panama Canal
or back to harbors where they were loaded.</TE>

Taiwan, Hong Kong and the Philippines, and an additional 600 tons
backing up in his warehouses in the San Joaquin Valley, the operator
of Pandol Bros. growers in Delano has had to pull the plug on much of
his harvesting right at the peak of the season, laying off farm
workers and letting grapes remain on the vine.</LD>
<TE>   "The orders I have today have been canceled," Pandol said. "They
don't need it anymore. If it isn't available, [overseas customers]
don't wait. They just buy something else."</TE>
<TE>   Other California crops, too, have racked up losses and are waiting
for a reprieve. About 14% of California's annual harvest is exported,
to the tune of $6.5 billion, according to state figures.</TE>
<TE>   Although much of that is trucked to Canada and Mexico, right now
thousands of tons of oranges, broccoli, lettuce and other vegetables
are stuck in refrigerated containers at the ports of Los Angeles,
Long Beach and Oakland.</TE>
<TE>   Although dockworkers and their employers have agreed to mediation
in their contract dispute, and ports could reopen in coming days, it
may be too late for this produce to make it to overseas destinations.</TE>
<TE>   And on the flip side, bananas and other imported fruit can't make
it into port, sparking fears of shortages.</TE>
<TE>   So far the economic toll has been small, but even if the ports
open up in the next couple of days, many growers and wholesalers
could be out thousands of dollars in lost orders and additional
costs.</TE>
<TE>   The port shutdown comes when many of California's top agricultural
exports are being harvested. If the closures last much longer, Pandol
and others say the U.S. market could be flooded with certain types of
produce such as seedless grapes, a third of which are sent overseas.</TE>
<TE>   "We already have a dramatically oversupplied [U.S.] market,"
Pandol said.</TE>
<TE>   That could mean serious losses for Pandol and the rest of the
grape industry because grape prices have plunged on this year's
record crop.</TE>
<TE>   And economists say that if the situation lasts much longer, even
as little as a week, it could put a strain on California's entire
produce industry.</TE>
<TE>   "Not only will people be hurt by this, they will be hurt pretty
broadly [across the produce sector]," said Larry Karp, an economist
at UC Berkeley.</TE>
<TE>   Some farmers have embarked on letter-writing campaigns to
President Bush and members of Congress.</TE>
<TE>   But mostly, they're waiting--waiting for their product to go out
and for goods to come in.</TE>
<TE>   "We'll be out of bananas by Friday," said Richard A. Flammino,
president of Umina Bros. in the L.A. Wholesale Produce Market, as
forklifts whizzed around him hoisting loads of grapefruits and
tomatoes early Wednesday. "If you don't have it you can't sell it.
This is a loss of revenue for us."</TE>
<TE>   As much as 40% of the company's produce--including pineapple,
avocado, citrus and bananas--travels through the port, both inbound
and outbound, he said. If the ports don't open by the weekend, he may
have to lay off a worker.</TE>
<TE>   Linda Chen, president of Borg Produce, also in the downtown
Wholesale Market, doesn't think the situation, regardless of its
duration, will deter clever growers from getting their goods through.
She believes many will find ways to bypass the ports, even if it
means sending goods into Mexican seaports and trucking in from there.</TE>
<TE>   "There are ways around it," said Chen, who has seen a run on
bananas at her stall as nervous customers fret about shortages.
"You're not going to see 'no bananas' on store shelves. They will
truck the stuff in if they have to."</TE>
<TE>   Still, the added expense could mean higher prices for bananas and
for other types of imported tropical fruit such as Hawaiian
pineapple.</TE>
<TE>   Maui Pineapple Co., for instance, already has racked up higher
costs by shipping its canned pineapple weeks ahead of time and paying
extra warehousing fees. The firm also paid more money to airfreight
fresh fruit from Hawaii, President Doug Schenk said.</TE>
<TE>   However, he declined to say just how much these moves were costing
him or his customers.</TE>
<TE>   Costs are mounting for Pandol too. The grape grower will have to
first pay a trucker $800 to truck the 200 tons of grapes, lettuce and
broccoli sitting at the port of Oakland back to his warehouse in
Delano so he can switch out the grapes, replacing them with fresher
fruit. The fruit that had been sitting in the containers, if it is
salvaged soon, will have to be sold locally at a much lower price.</TE>
<TE>   Some have given up on waiting to ship to overseas customers.</TE>
<TE>   Tanimura &amp; Antle, one of the state's largest produce shippers, has
begun diverting most of the 800 tons of top-shelf broccoli it would
have exported this week to the regional market, foregoing the 25%
markup the firm gets by selling in Asian markets.</TE>
<TE>   "Customers here are now getting export-quality produce at a
domestic price," said Chuck Schreiber, director of international
sales for Tanimura &amp; Antle in Salinas.</TE>
<TE>   For Schreiber's 20 container loads on the dock and on a vessel in
Oakland harbor, there are only a few days left before the produce
ripens and the trip must be abandoned, along with the extra profit.</TE>
<TE>   "Our growers in this valley have not had a great year," Schreiber
said. "Our job is to return the most profit back to them. This is
just very frustrating."</TE>

<HD>EMI Signs Pricey Contract With British Singer</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHUCK PHILIPS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>EMI Group signed a lavish deal Wednesday with British pop star Robbie
Williams to keep the singer under a contract that allows the
struggling music corporation to tap into a bevy of new revenue
streams such as sponsorships, concert receipts, merchandising and
acting fees.</LD>
<LD>   Industry sources said the deal could be worth more than $60
million--nearly half of which EMI was required to pay Williams upon
signing the contract. Although Williams is not well-known in the
U.S., the photogenic pop star is wildly successful in Europe and has
sold more than 20 million albums worldwide.</LD>
<LD>   Representatives for EMI and Williams declined to comment.</LD>
<TE>   Sources said the contract required EMI to invest about $20 million
for a minority stake in a new company that will manage Williams'
touring, merchandising, sponsorship and film and TV deals. Sources
said EMI would share about 30% of the revenue generated by those
ventures--unlike most music companies, which typically get paid for
only record sales.</TE>
<TE>   Under EMI's deal with Williams, sources said, the company also
must advance him $10 million as soon as he delivers his next album.
The pact requires Williams to deliver four studio albums, plus two
greatest-hits compilations. Sources said EMI could pay Williams as
much as $30 million for those recordings over the next decade.</TE>
<TE>   EMI, home to such acts as Coldplay and Janet Jackson, has
struggled through years of management turmoil, cutting jobs, closing
labels, firing artists and grappling with digital piracy as music
sales decline industrywide. EMI posted a loss of about $310 million
in the year ended March 31.</TE>

<HD>Money Manager Urges Dole to Reject Bid</HD>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Atlantic Investment Management Inc., which owns 3.4 million shares,
or about 6%, of Dole Food Co. is urging an independent panel of
directors to reject an offer by Chairman David H. Murdock to take the
Westlake Village company private.</LD>
<LD>   In a Securities and Exchange Commission filing, the money manager
said the offer was too low and blamed Murdock for making several
managerial decisions that have depressed the price of Dole's shares.</LD>
<LD>   Last month, Dole named a special committee to review Murdock's
offer to pay $29.50 a share for the 76% of the company he doesn't
already own. Including the assumption of debt, the transaction would
be valued at around $2.5 billion. Dole shares closed at $29.10, up 15
cents, on the NYSE.</LD>
<TE>   Other investment funds also have objected to Murdock's bid, saying
it was too low, but Atlantic was the first to blame Murdock for what
it considers a low valuation for the company.</TE>

<LD>Americans flooded lenders with a record number of mortgage
applications last week, spurred by rock-bottom rates that have
mobilized homeowners to refinance. The Mortgage Bankers Assn. of
America's weekly gauge of mortgage request volume, on a seasonally
adjusted basis, rose to 1,285.4 for the week ended Friday, up 8.6%
from the prior week. The reading beat the previous high of 1,238.2
for the week ended Sept. 6.</LD>

<LD>State Farm Insurance Cos. has been ordered to stop marketing and
selling long-term care policies in California, in what the state
Department of Insurance said is a violation of state law that could
bring a $500,000 fine.</LD>
<LD>   State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Co. continued selling the
policies after Oct. 1, 2001, when a new law barred such policies
unless they provided enhanced benefits, the department said.</LD>
<LD>   The department's order demands the firm refund premiums to anyone
sold a policy after the deadline that has since been canceled or
lapsed, and that continuing policies sold after the deadline be
replaced with policies containing the enhanced benefits at no
additional cost.</LD>

<LD>Adelphia Communications Corp. founder John Rigas, two of his sons and
two other former company executives pleaded not guilty to charges of
defrauding the cable television system operator of more than $2.5
billion.</LD>
<LD>   Authorities accused the Rigases of hiding $2.3 billion in debt,
looting company funds to pay for personal expenses such as stock
purchases and a golf course, and lying to investors about the
company's financial health. Adelphia sought bankruptcy protection and
faces more than $20 billion in debt.</LD>
<LD>   Rigas, 78, and sons Timothy, the former chief financial officer,
and Michael, the former vice president for operations, entered not
guilty pleas before U.S. District Judge Leonard Sand.</LD>
<TE>   James Brown, the former vice president for finance, and Michael
Mulcahey, the former director of internal reporting, also entered not
guilty pleas.</TE>
<TE>   The five men face as much as 30 years in prison.</TE>
<TE>   Andrew Levander, an attorney for Michael Rigas, signaled a defense
strategy when he said the main transactions in the indictment were
approved by Adelphia's former auditor, Deloitte &amp; Touche, and by law
firm Buchanan Ingersoll.</TE>

<LD>Dell Computer Corp. expects to pass the combined Hewlett-Packard Co.

tallied.</LD>
<LD>   At a meeting with financial analysts in Austin, Texas, Dell
officials said they are continuing to gain market share from HP and
other rivals. But they said Dell has more opportunity in selling
computer servers, storage and services.</LD>
<LD>   The comments came a day after Dell raised its sales forecast for

<LD>Enron Corp. completed the auction of its new 40-story Houston
skyscraper. Terms and identity of the winning bidder won't be
disclosed until a Bankruptcy Court hearing on the sale Oct. 10. The
sale of the Cesar Pelli-designed Enron Center South, which Enron
never occupied, is part of an effort to recoup some of the $50
billion owed to creditors. Houston real estate brokers said the
building probably would sell for about $100 million, less than its
estimated development cost of more than $300 million.</LD>

<LD>Dow Chemical Co. warned that it would miss third-quarter earnings
estimates, surprising analysts and sending the company's shares
lower.</LD>
<LD>   Dow cited higher costs for oil and gas feedstocks, mainly in
Europe, as the principal reason for the warning, which had a ripple
effect among chemical industry stocks.</LD>
<LD>   Midland, Mich.-based Dow expects third-quarter earnings per share
to be "about the same" as the 16-cent-a-share profit it reported in
the year-earlier quarter, a forecast that is nearly 45% below the
29-cent consensus estimate of analysts.</LD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The federal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission filed suit
against Sega of America Inc. and Spherion Corp., alleging the
companies fired 12 Filipino workers because of their national origin.</LD>
<LD>   The workers were employed by Spherion, a Fort Lauderdale,
Fla.-based temporary employment agency, but worked at Sega's San
Francisco offices to test video games, the EEOC said. Sega fired the
workers after another employee complained that the Filipino testers
were getting preferential treatment, said Cindy O'Hara, an EEOC
attorney handling the case.</LD>
<LD>   Sega also fired the employee who complained, along with four of
his friends, the EEOC said. A Sega spokeswoman declined to comment.
Spherion did not return calls.</LD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Retailer Wet Seal Inc., which sells trendy clothes to girls and young
women, said Wednesday that sales slowed in late September, prompting
the company to reduce its financial expectations for the current
quarter.</LD>
<LD>   The Foothill Ranch-based company--which in addition to its
namesake stores operates Arden B and Zutopia stores--said sales of
sweaters and casual pants have been weak.</LD>
<LD>   The slower sales and increased markdowns, in part, could cause
earnings to be break-even to 5 cents a share. A consensus of analysts
from Thomson First Call forecast earnings of 18 cents.</LD>
<TE>   If the current sales trends continue through the end of the fiscal
year, fourth-quarter earnings could fall below the 49 cents a share
analysts were expecting, the company said.</TE>
<TE>   Weak fourth-quarter sales also would cause the company to reduce
the number of new stores it is planning to 75 and 100.</TE>
<TE>   Wet Seal shares closed Wednesday at $9.20, up 22 cents, on Nasdaq.
The shares have lost 41% of their value this year. The earnings
projection was issued after the close of trading.</TE>
<TE>   Wet Seal also said its board has authorized the repurchase of as
many as 5.4 million shares of stock, at management's discretion.</TE>

<AU>PETER G. GOSSELIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Federal mediator Peter J. Hurtgen already was being portrayed as
pro-management by the time he arrived in California this week to seek
a way out of the labor mess that has shut down ports up and down the
West Coast.</LD>
<LD>   According to colleagues, adversaries and observers, there is
something to the characterization. Hurtgen spent years as a partner
at management law firm Morgan, Lewis &amp; Bockius, which represents the
Pacific Maritime Assn.--the group that has locked union workers out
of their jobs in the current dispute.</LD>
<LD>   But the 61-year-old Hurtgen is hardly the cardboard-cutout
opponent that some labor critics want to make him.</LD>
<TE>   He is a Republican who was appointed by a Democratic president,
Bill Clinton, to the National Labor Relations Board, which
administers the nation's labor laws. Though consistently
pro-management as a panel member, his views were insufficiently
fervent to shield him from right-wing criticism and a decision by the
incoming Bush administration not to reappoint him to another full
term. He left the NLRB and two months ago became director of the
Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service.</TE>
<TE>   "The fact is he practiced at a law firm that represents
management," said NLRB member Wilma B. Liebman, a Democrat. But, she
added, "he's extremely fair and knowledgeable" and "believes
collective bargaining is the way for labor and management to settle
their differences."</TE>
<TE>   Hurtgen did not respond to requests through aides for an
interview.</TE>
<TE>   The mediator's faith in the collective-bargaining process--and
that of the mediation service he runs--will be sorely tested in the
battle over the ports.</TE>
<TE>   The tiny but once-influential agency has been largely bypassed by
history. As the influence of organized labor and the number of
big-time strikes have declined in recent decades, so has the ability
of a mediation service director to pick up the phone, reach a Labor
secretary or president and swing the weight of the federal government
behind a deal.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, so thoroughgoing has been the mediation service's decline
that it sought to remake itself in the 1990s into a kind of
institutional therapist that mostly helps other government agencies
work out their relationships with various interest groups.</TE>
<TE>   "Because of the change in collective bargaining in our society,
it's difficult for the FMCS to muster the kind of stature and clout
it once had," said John R. Stepp, a senior Labor Department official
during the Carter and Reagan years who has worked closely with the
agency.</TE>
<TE>   When the mediation service was set up in 1947, economy-shaking
strikes were a regular occurrence and mediators were like Wild West
sheriffs, riding into town to break up brawls and restore order.</TE>
<TE>   "What you want is one of those really gruff guys like [legendary
New York mediator] Ted Kheel, who can knock heads and get a deal,"
said Charles C. Heckscher, a Rutgers University labor specialist. But
few such characters still exist, he said.</TE>
<TE>   In their place has emerged a new type of mediator, a neutral
broker who encourages various sides to a dispute to talk out their
differences and come to common solutions. Hurtgen appears to see
himself in this mold.</TE>
<TE>   Besides loss of clout and a shift in agency focus, Hurtgen carries
another burden into the port stalemate: He's been on the job just
eight weeks and has spent most of them rushing from one crisis to
another.</TE>
<TE>   Before diving into the current contest, he
tried--unsuccessfully--to broker a deal between Boeing Co. and its
25,000 unionized production workers. Although the workers ultimately
settled on a contract, it was only after company bargainers walked
out on Hurtgen-led sessions with the machinists union.</TE>
<TE>   Despite such troubles, even adversaries acknowledge that Hurtgen
brings considerable talents and immense experience to the fight
between the PMA, which represents shipping companies and terminal
operators, and the International Longshore and Warehouse Union.</TE>
<TE>   "He is absolutely forthright," said Howard S. Susskind, a union
lawyer who clashed with Hurtgen in Florida when the mediator headed
Morgan Lewis' Miami labor practice during the 1980s. "If he has
something to say, he says it; there are not hidden agendas."</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps as important, Hurtgen has shown a flair for charming those
who might be expected to oppose him and offending those who, by all
rights, should support him--a very useful skill for a mediator.</TE>
<TE>   He demonstrated his ability to good effect in persuading Clinton
to appoint him to the National Labor Relations Board in 1997. But he
may have had an advantage over others vying for the post: Hurtgen was
Clinton's hall proctor when the two were undergraduates at Georgetown
University.</TE>
<TE>   More recently, Hurtgen incurred the wrath of the anti-union
National Right to Work Committee, which successfully lobbied the Bush
administration last year to deny him a full term as NLRB chairman.
Hurtgen was unfit for the job, charged NRWC Vice President Stefan
Gleason, because he "helped Big Labor expand its political empire
using forced union dues seized from workers."</TE>
<TE>   Whether Hurtgen can use such a blast from anti-union forces to
gain the trust of the West Coast longshoremen may well turn on how
union leaders view his ties to his former law firm, Morgan Lewis.
Morgan Lewis partner Charles P. O'Connor is a key player on the PMA's
legal team and has sat in on a number of the employer group's
bargaining sessions with the union.</TE>
<TE>   Aides pointed out that Hurtgen has been out of the firm for five
years. Former NLRB colleagues said the mediator's ties to Morgan
Lewis were considered so old that he was not required to recuse
himself from cases in which the firm's lawyers participated during
his final years on the board.</TE>
<TE>   But it is clear that Hurtgen has maintained warm relations with
his former law partners, and both he and the firm announced that
Hurtgen would return to Morgan Lewis when his regular term on the
NLRB expired in August of last year.</TE>
<TE>   Only a last-minute "recess" appointment to another term and then
Bush's choice of him to head the mediation service kept him from
rejoining his old practice.</TE>
<TE>   At a party this summer celebrating his appointment to the
mediation service, friends said Hurtgen jokingly reassured them he
had not gone from being pro-management to pro-union.</TE>
<TE>   "I haven't gone over to the dark side," he is quoted as telling
well-wishers. Instead, he said, "I've gone to the middle."</TE>

<LD>   The two firms led high school students to believe that their
personal information would be shared only with colleges but in fact
sold their lists to credit-card companies, advertising agencies and
direct marketers, according to a complaint filed by the Federal Trade
Commission.</LD>
<LD>   American Student List and the National Research Center for College
and University Admissions agreed not to sell their existing lists to
commercial operators, and to fix their privacy statements in future
surveys to reveal how they use students' information, according to a
tentative settlement announced by the FTC.</LD>
<TE>   The two firms did not admit guilt and will not give back profits
or pay other penalties, but will face fines of up to $11,000 per
count if they violate the agreement.</TE>
<TE>   The surveys, distributed to millions of students since 1988, asked
recipients to provide their name, address, grade-point average, sex,
race, religion and personal interests.</TE>
<TE>   The surveys' privacy statement said the data would be used by
colleges, universities and "other organizations."</TE>
<TE>   Howard Beales, head of the FTC's consumer-protection division,
said the statement led students, teachers and guidance counselors to
believe that the surveys would be shared with colleges only for
recruiting purposes.</TE>
<TE>   "A privacy policy should shine light on a company's information
practices, not obscure them," Beales said.</TE>

<HD>Tenet Says Its Profit More Than Doubled</HD>
<DH>Earnings: The hospital operator has reported eight straight
quarters of growth of 25% or more. It boosts its outlook for the
coming year.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DON LEE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Despite the rising number of Americans without health insurance,
persistent nursing shortages and widespread pressures to hold down
health-care costs, Tenet Healthcare Corp. reported another strong
quarter and showed few signs of slowing.</LD>
<LD>   The nation's No. 2 hospital operator said Wednesday that profit
more than doubled in its quarter ended Aug. 31, and the Santa
Barbara-based company boosted its outlook for the coming year.</LD>
<LD>   Tenet has reported eight straight quarters of earnings growth of
25% or more. The company, which operates 114 hospitals, including 40
in California, continues to enjoy solid gains in admissions, higher
payments from insurers and improvements in such areas as debt
collection.</LD>
<TE>   In particular, Tenet executives said the company is generating
higher revenue by treating older patients and those with acute
conditions--a cornerstone of Tenet's long-term strategy. The company
said it is spending $1 billion this year for capital improvements,
much of it for specialties such as cardiology.</TE>
<TE>   Based on such trends, Tenet estimated that earnings for the
2002-03 fiscal year would grow by at least 25%. Analysts said that
was realistic, but perhaps a little conservative.</TE>
<TE>   Robert Mains, a health-care analyst for Advest Inc., a brokerage
in Saratoga Springs, N.Y., said Tenet and other publicly traded
hospitals now have an advantage. Most of their competitors are
not-for-profit hospitals, and many of them are struggling and do not
have the cash or access to capital to invest and grow.</TE>
<TE>   Tenet and other hospital chains are facing greater risks from the
rising number of uninsured, reported this week by the Census Bureau,
which could affect many consumers' ability to pay their hospital
bills. But compared with its peers, Tenet has done a better job of
collecting bad debt, with some room for improvement, said Sheryl
Skolnick, a managing director at Fulcrum Global Partners, which
provides investor research.</TE>
<TE>   Skolnick said pressures to keep a lid on health insurance rate
increases could result in a push to cut payments to hospitals, but
she doesn't see that happening soon. Skolnick said Tenet is
well-positioned because its strategy is to be a dominant player in
its market. "Concentration in discrete markets seems to be working,"
she said.</TE>
<TE>   Jeffrey C. Barbakow, Tenet's chairman and chief executive, said
labor is the company's biggest concern. He noted that California's
new nurse-to-patient ratio requirements will add to the chronic
nursing shortage, but he also said the company was doing a better job
of retaining nurses.</TE>
<TE>   For its fiscal first quarter, Tenet earned $338 million, or 68
cents a share, up from $155 million, or 31 cents. Revenue rose 12% to
$3.7 billion, from $3.3 billion.</TE>
<TE>   Tenet's shares rose $1.45 on Wednesday, or 3%, to $51.55 on the
New York Stock Exchange.</TE>

<HD>Transkaryotic Shares Plunge</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DENISE GELLENE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Transkaryotic Therapies Inc. disclosed Wednesday that the Food and
Drug Administration was sharply critical of its data on an
experimental treatment for Fabry's disease, stunning investors who
thought Replagal was on track for approval.</LD>
<LD>   The Cambridge, Mass., company also slashed its third-quarter
earnings projections, citing slower sales of Replagal in Europe. The
news drove the company's shares down about 45% to $18.40 on Nasdaq
amid questions about the firm's previous disclosures.</LD>
<LD>   Chief Executive Richard Selden, in a conference call with
analysts, would not say when the company learned that the FDA had
problems with its data, particularly on pain. Analysts said the data
were in briefing documents that Transkaryotic received about a month
ago from the FDA in preparation for an advisory panel meeting. The
advisory meeting had been set for last week but was canceled.</LD>
<TE>   "I feel we have been forthcoming in our statements about the FDA
and am quite comfortable with how we have conducted ourselves,"
Selden said. However, he did not respond directly when an analyst
asked if Transkaryotic had been contacted by the Securities and
Exchange Commission.</TE>
<TE>   Transkaryotic told analysts that the FDA said its pain data were
"uninterpretable" and "did not support approval." The firm had
expected that the drug would be approved on the basis of its pain
relief data.</TE>
<TE>   Selden said the firm was in talks with the FDA about using other
findings from clinical trials to support drug approval. He said he
believed that Replagal would be approved, possibly by early next
year.</TE>
<TE>   But analysts said that it now appeared that Transkaryotic's rival
Genzyme Corp. was ahead in the race to market a drug for Fabry's
disease, a rare disorder that affects no more than 2,000 Americans.
The winner stands to receive from the FDA an exclusive license to
market its drug for seven years.</TE>
<TE>   The drugs are genetically engineered copies of an enzyme lacking
in Fabry's patients. Without it, fatty substances build up in the
kidneys, and that can lead to organ failure.</TE>
<TE>   "We thought TKT had the lead for getting approval for Replagal,
and now it looks like that has totally evaporated," said William
Tanner, an analyst with Leerink Swann &amp; Co. in Boston. " ... We were
sort of led to believe that things maybe were OK."</TE>

<HD>SEC Wants Pro Forma Results Spelled Out</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Securities and Exchange Commission is preparing a rule to require
companies that publish pro forma financial results to explain how
those numbers differ from earnings that follow U.S. accounting
standards.</LD>
<LD>   Pro forma figures, which exclude costs such as merger charges,
became popular in the 1990s as many otherwise marginally profitable
or unprofitable technology firms tried to make their finances appear
more favorable.</LD>
<LD>   About 1,500 companies used pro forma results in news releases last
year before filing official reports under generally accepted
accounting principles, according to industry estimates.</LD>
<TE>   The Sarbanes-Oxley corporate reform law that President Bush signed
in July requires companies that use pro forma results to show how
they compare with earnings that follow U.S. rules, and forbids
companies from issuing news releases that omit "material" facts.</TE>
<TE>   The SEC plans to propose a rule this month to spell out the
requirements of the law.</TE>
<TE>   "You have pro formas that on their face are flat-out misleading,
and it occurs often enough to be troubling," SEC Corporation Finance
Director Alan Beller said. "Reconciling the figures is a pretty clear
way of dealing with the problem."</TE>
<TE>   Some executives say pro forma earnings give a better picture of a
company's true growth rate within its basic business. Although some
firms don't explain their pro forma numbers, hundreds of others
already relate in their earnings news releases what their numbers are
under U.S. accounting rules as well as pro forma results.</TE>
<TE>   In a survey of 133 companies, about 10% weren't complying with
industry guidelines for reconciling pro forma numbers with official
figures, the National Investor Relations Institute has said.</TE>
<TE>   "Ten percent is higher than what we should accept," Beller said.</TE>

<HD>Teachers' Pension Fund to Disclose Proxy Votes</HD>

<BD>Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The California State Teachers' Retirement System pension fund will
publish its votes on corporate issues for stocks it owns and lobby
for regulators to impose such disclosure requirements on mutual
funds, state Treasurer Phil Angelides said Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   Federal regulators have proposed that mutual funds should reveal
their votes, a move proponents say would stop funds from courting
management at other shareholders' expense.</LD>
<LD>   "Investors have a right to know whether a mutual fund votes in the
interest of investors ... or in lock-step with corporate management
whose lucrative 401(k) and pension fund business they desire,"
Angelides said.</LD>
<TE>   The California teachers' board, of which Angelides is a member,
voted to publish its proxy policies and votes on its Web site.
Previously, it had furnished information on its votes on request.</TE>

<HD>Revoke Hussein's 'Probation'</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SPENCER J. CRONA and NEAL A. RICHARDSON</AU>
<BD>Spencer J. Crona is a Denver lawyer who has written
about the vulnerability to terrorism of fossil fuel-based energy
systems. Neal A. Richardson is a deputy district attorney in Denver.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>We should harbor no illusions about Saddam Hussein's determined
belief that weapons of mass destruction will demonstrate his
preeminence over the Middle East.</LD>
<LD>   And we should recognize that his particular weapons fetish poses
the kinds of credible "downside risks" that make action not only
imperative but lawful.</LD>
<LD>   Consider a scenario in which the United States' next national
emergency call comes after another year of political dithering about
the Hussein regime. One day, after we have slipped back into the
routines of ordinary peacetime life, a small package is delivered to
the U.S. mission at the United Nations. Inside is a videotape that
depicts each stage of fabrication of a crude nuclear weapon and shows
the finished product placed in an anonymous office, apartment or
truck trailer somewhere in the U.S.</LD>
<TE>   Accompanying the tape are blueprints and engineering
specifications verifying the bomb's functionality, along with a list
of demands from an Al Qaeda-like group. Among the demands is the
directive that the U.S. must "end the starvation of the Iraqi
children" by immediately terminating all sanctions, "no-fly" zones
and blockades of Iraq and by withdrawing all U.S. forces from the
Persian Gulf. The "delivery system" for this doomsday device is one
of the 98% of cargo containers that arrive without scrutiny each day
in U.S. ports, rather than a mode traceable to its source.</TE>
<TE>   Suppose the device goes off, having been placed in the favorite
target city--New York, say, next to the New York Stock Exchange. The
explosion, of "tactical nuclear" proportions, kills or maims tens of
thousands of people and renders a large area around the country's
financial nerve center uninhabitable.</TE>
<TE>   Then comes the economic fallout, and there is no shelter. When
trading resumes with a jury-rigged infrastructure, the U.S.
experiences economic panic and crash. Markets hate uncertainty, and
they react violently to the paramount uncertainty of where and when
the next mushroom cloud will sprout.</TE>
<TE>   The troubling question is not whether this scenario is realistic
or far-fetched. It is whether there can be any magnitude of evidence
of Hussein's intentions and capabilities that would satisfy those
critics in the international community who complain that the U.S. has
failed to justify military action to oust him.</TE>
<TE>   The nations of the Gulf War coalition already are at war with Iraq
and have been for these last dozen years, at varying levels of
intensity.</TE>
<TE>   When we deploy combat aircraft to enforce no-fly zones over a
sovereign nation, we are engaging in a species of blockade that is
quintessentially an act of war. Should an F-16 pilot enforcing the
no-fly zones be required to radio for U.N. Security Council approval
before he fires on an Iraqi radar station "locking on" to target his
aircraft?</TE>
<TE>   Iraq in this situation is like a criminal who mugs elderly people
to get money for his drug habit. The criminal is convicted of armed
robbery and put on probation. One of the conditions is that he submit
to random drug testing. When he refuses the drug tests, he should not
have to be caught red-handed committing a new crime before his
probation is revoked.</TE>
<TE>   There is ample justification under international law for an
invasion of Iraq, even without reference to the Bush administration's
new doctrine of preemptive self-defense, which could be dangerous in
the wrong hands.</TE>
<TE>   We need not only "regime change" as a policy goal but "regime
trial" for the institutional war criminals of the Iraqi leadership.
Such trials would serve as an object lesson and deterrent to leaders
of the new "axis of evil," as well as afford justice to the thousands
of Hussein's victims.</TE>

<AU>PAUL FINDLEY</AU>
<BD>Paul Findley, a Republican, represented Illinois in the
House of Representatives from 1961 to 1983. He was a major author of
the War Powers Resolution of 1973.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>My former colleagues in Congress are grappling with President Bush's
request for congressional authority to use "all means necessary,"
including force, against Iraq and "to take action in order to deter
and prevent acts of international terrorism."</LD>
<LD>   It is unlikely that Congress will ever face a request of higher
risk to the well-being of the American people, as well as to all of
humankind.</LD>
<LD>   In brief, the president asks Congress to support his decision to
establish war-making as a presidential policy tool rather than an
instrument of last resort.</LD>
<TE>   Until now, declaring war has been accepted as the exclusive domain
of Congress, the people's branch of government.</TE>
<TE>   The president's new security document shifts basic policy from
deterrence to dominance of adversaries and arrogates enormous new
authority to the president.</TE>
<TE>   To fulfill this self-appointed duty to police the world, our
government declares that it must maintain absolute military supremacy
worldwide and take all necessary action to assure that adversarial
nations do not increase their military power.</TE>
<TE>   In a notable bit of arrogance, the plan even assumes U.S.
responsibility to advise other nations, starting with China, on
proper budget outlays for military purposes.</TE>
<TE>   The plan relegates the United Nations and all other international
institutions to supporting roles: If they take the lead that the
United States directs, fine. If not, they become irrelevant.</TE>
<TE>   Is the attempt at worldwide rule prudent for any nation, even one
as large, militarily strong and democratically based as the United
States?</TE>
<TE>   Should the president abandon this country's long-standing,
principled opposition to preemptive acts of war?</TE>
<TE>   If we do strike, in violation of international law, other states
will reasonably conclude that such strikes are acceptable military
conduct.</TE>
<TE>   In that case, the world may sink to the law of the jungle.</TE>
<TE>   Even if Congress concludes that preemptive acts of war can be
justified, other questions remain.</TE>
<TE>   Should advance congressional approval be required in each case? If
so, can Saddam Hussein's regime in Iraq be considered a sufficient
threat to U.S. security to qualify for preemptive assault?</TE>
<TE>   Any resolution must be drafted so carefully that it cannot be
construed as a declaration of war, which would automatically convey
dictatorial powers to the president.</TE>
<TE>   As a member of Congress in 1848, Abraham Lincoln cited war-making
as the "most oppressive of all kingly oppressions," and he also
declared that the Constitution was constructed in such a way "that no
one man should hold the power of bringing this oppression upon us."</TE>
<TE>   Congress must deny the president's request for fast approval of a
preemptive strike against Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   The issues involved are too monumental for a quick decision.</TE>
<TE>   But as an interim response, Congress could enact a concurrent
resolution listing the circumstances in which the president may
constitutionally order acts of war: to comply with a treaty
obligation or to repel a military attack against the territory of the
United States, its possessions, military services engaged in peaceful
maneuvers or shipping; to participate in humanitarian rescue
operations; or in response to a declaration of war or other authority
approved by a majority of the members of each house of Congress.</TE>

<HD>Secession: A Tale of New Cities</HD>
<DH>There's no plot, just government reorganization.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOEL FOX</AU>
<BD>Joel Fox is past president of the Howard Jarvis
Taxpayers Assn. and an advisor to the San Fernando Valley cityhood
effort.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Ballot measures allowing Hollywood and the San Fernando Valley to
break away from Los Angeles have stirred colorful analogies to bygone
periods from our history.</LD>
<LD>   Some use the term "secession" and conjure up pictures of
140-year-old battlefields. Others talk about "independence" from
"King James" Hahn in the same fervent tones as did the patriots of
1776.</LD>
<LD>   The unglamorous truth is that the breakup of Los Angeles is
neither a rebellious secession nor a revolution dethroning a king.</LD>
<TE>   Measures F (the Valley city measure) and H (the Hollywood city
measure) amount to a reorganization of government.</TE>
<TE>   Reorganizing government to make it more responsive to citizens'
needs is a time-honored tradition. States call constitutional
conventions. On the national level, ground-shifting elections put
Franklin D. Roosevelt and Ronald Reagan in power to change the course
of government.</TE>
<TE>   And creating new cities is hardly new.</TE>
<TE>   Since 1886, a new city has been created in Los Angeles County on
the average of once every 1.3 years.</TE>
<TE>   It's true that this breakup is different because the new cities
are not being taken out of unincorporated county land, as most
previous city incorporations did. The contentious split of a standing
city hasn't occurred in California since Coronado pulled away from
San Diego in 1890.</TE>
<TE>   But the reasoning is the same: to make government more responsive
and accountable to its citizens.</TE>
<TE>   In the process, the reorganization also gives these same benefits
to those remaining in Los Angeles by, for example, shrinking the
number of constituents a City Council member must serve by about
half.</TE>
<TE>   Reorganization doesn't lead to cultural changes, as rebellion and
revolution might. Even if they break away, people in the Valley and
Hollywood still will root for the Lakers, just as the people of Los
Angeles did when the Lakers played in Inglewood.</TE>
<TE>   The idea of reorganizing government is not going away no matter
what happens in November.</TE>
<TE>   Supporters of self-governing boroughs within the city, suggested
as a way to prevent the cityhood drives, say they will pursue that
idea if the breakup fails.</TE>
<TE>   And the Los Angeles Unified School District has been ripe for
reorganization for years. If the cityhood drives are successful,
efforts will intensify to break the district into smaller parts.</TE>
<TE>   Regional problems that extend beyond city boundaries may be solved
with new governmental approaches. Policy experts talk about the
counties being geographic relics and suggest that reorganization of
counties will help improve service delivery over regions. Some sort
of regional government may be offered to voters.</TE>
<TE>   What kind of governmental reorganizations voters want remains to
be seen. But when people decide that a government is not meeting
their needs, they will change it, just as they change their personal
lives. Some move to a new location, some seek a new job and, yes,
some even get a divorce.</TE>

<HD>Now Let Jersey Voters Just Vote</HD>
<DH>The state court should have the last word.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD L. HASEN</AU>
<BD>Richard L. Hasen, a professor specializing in election
law at Loyola Law School in Los Angeles, consulted with the Gore
campaign on the manual recount issue in Miami-Dade County.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The New Jersey Supreme Court held Wednesday that Sen. Robert
Torricelli's name could be replaced on the general election ballot
with a new nominee chosen by the Democratic Party.</LD>
<LD>   At issue in the case was a New Jersey election statute that
provides for a political party to fill a vacancy at least 51 days
before the election when its nominee, for whatever reason, cannot or
will not run in the general election.</LD>
<LD>   Here, Democrats pressured Torricelli--because of a plummet in the
polls in light of ethics questions--to withdraw from his reelection
bid against Republican Doug Forrester.</LD>
<TE>   The New Jersey court allowed the Democrats to make the change less
than 51 days before the election.</TE>
<TE>   It relied on a 1952 decision by the same court that said it is in
the public interest to give the electorate a choice between
candidates of both major parties.</TE>
<TE>   In that 1952 case, the court had excused a similar filing deadline
that would have kept the name of the dead candidate on the ballot,
and it had noted that the Legislature imposed the filing deadline
with the "obvious intent" of affording election officials sufficient
time to prepare for elections.</TE>
<TE>   The New Jersey court Wednesday rejected the Republicans' argument
that by imposing a statutory 51-day limit for filling vacancies
before the election and remaining silent on what happens within the
51-day limit, the Legislature intended not to allow the parties to
fill vacancies in the closer time period.</TE>
<TE>   Lawyers for the Republicans have announced plans to take this case
to the U.S. Supreme Court, and pundits are already comparing this
dispute to the Florida election fiasco of 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Although there are some similarities, this time the high court
should stay out of the controversy.</TE>
<TE>   What is the federal issue Republicans could take to the high
court?</TE>
<TE>   Republicans probably will argue that the New Jersey court opinion
constitutes a "new law," thereby taking away the power given by the
U.S. Constitution to state legislatures to choose the manner for the
selection of U.S. senators. This is parallel to the argument accepted
by three high court justices in Bush vs. Gore: that the Florida
Supreme Court's decision to allow the selective recounting of
under-votes was a new law making an end run around Florida's
legislative requirements for choosing presidential electors. The high
court is already scheduled later this year to hear a case out of
Mississippi that raises a similar issue.</TE>
<TE>   Republicans also could argue that changing the rules in midstream
violates one's right to due process or equal protection of the law.</TE>
<TE>   If the U.S. Supreme Court gets involved here, it will only cement
the idea arising out of Bush vs. Gore that every election dispute is
a potential federal constitutional case. However, a court that
respects the values of federalism should leave all but the most
egregious disputes over the meaning of state law alone.</TE>
<TE>   The circumstances here are not egregious.</TE>
<TE>   The court should recognize that state legislatures leave gaps in
their election statutes all the time, and legislatures fully expect
the state courts to fill the gaps with sensible rules. Federal
intervention would disrupt this partnership between state courts and
state legislatures.</TE>
<TE>   The court's legitimacy also is at stake.</TE>
<TE>   Court intervention in this case, particularly if we see the same
5-4 Bush vs. Gore split in an opinion siding with the GOP position,
would only renew charges that the court is driven by political
considerations.</TE>
<TE>   The high court should not again interfere with how a
state--including that state's courts--chooses to conduct its
elections.</TE>

<AU>NORAH VINCENT</AU>
<BD>Norah Vincent is a writer and a senior fellow at the
Foundation for the Defense of Democracies, a think tank set up after
Sept. 11 to study terrorism. Web site: www.norah vincent.com.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A year ago, the Sept. 11 attacks prompted an exodus from New York
City, especially among downtowners who couldn't or wouldn't inhabit
the Dead Zone. For me and many others, it was the opposite. Sept. 11
compelled us to stay.</LD>
<LD>   Solidarity kicked in. We purchased and wore American flags and "I
Love New York" T-shirts. We assailed our local fire stations with
wreaths and cards, and we spent what money we had in restaurants and
shops south of 14th Street. We hung tough and got on with it because
that's what New Yorkers do.</LD>
<LD>   Well, sort of. Now, after putting in a year's worth of sedentary
support for my city, I am leaving. Sept. 11 didn't have anything to
do with my decision--I'm going because of my partner's job--but it
certainly has had a considerable effect on how I feel about the move.</LD>
<TE>   I feel guilty, like a rat jumping ship. If the "10 Suburbs You Can
Afford" cover story in this week's always trendy New York magazine is
any indication, absconding is also on the minds of a lot of my fellow
Gothamites.</TE>
<TE>   To some degree, it always has been. The city's well-to-do,
including many who worked in the World Trade Center towers, long have
sought refuge in commutable bedroom communities.</TE>
<TE>   But now people relocating north and west of the Hudson have a
tinge of the traitor about them, or at least some of us think we do.
I, for one, know I've taken a lot from my Lower East Side
neighborhood during a very prosperous period in its history, and now
I'm leaving it just when it seems to need me the most.</TE>
<TE>   When I came to New York in 1994, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani's term was
just beginning. The city embarked on a renaissance. Crime rates fell
to 20-year lows, and the bull market ran so long and hard that Wall
Street seemed like Pamplona. Restoration turned the once-tawdry Times
Square area into a theme park and transformed drug-ridden
neighborhoods like my own into resorts. By 2001, New York was
beguiling again.</TE>
<TE>   The terrorist attacks changed all that. In some buildings near
ground zero, half the tenants left within weeks of the attack.
Landlords had to drop rents precipitously to fill the vacancies. Even
so, real estate brokers say the downtown rental market is 10% below
what it was before Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, nearly half of the companies that lost office space
Sept. 11 have opted not to return to Lower Manhattan. Restaurants and
nightclubs have closed or seen sizable declines in their business.</TE>
<TE>   All that adds up to lost jobs, lost revenue, lost disposable
income in a city whose debt this year is almost as high as it was
during its fiscal crisis in 1975.</TE>
<TE>   What Sept. 11 did to New York sounds a little like what white
flight did to many of our nation's inner cities, and yet so many of
us are fleeing anyway, leaving the neighborhoods that, in my case at
least, nurtured and inspired us.</TE>
<TE>   Sure, New York will bounce back without us. It always has. With
20% of Manhattan's population turning over every five years, there's
always a fresh crop of new arrivals to invigorate this town. But when
you leave a place after it has suffered the most devastating attack
in its history, you feel a sense of disloyalty, even failure.</TE>
<TE>   But that is the price this city has always exacted from its
expatriates. It keeps you as one of its own, yet it goes on without
you all the same. And that is its own form of punishment.</TE>

<LD>The House and Senate may be rushing toward a barely debated
bipartisan resolution that gives congressional backing to President
Bush in any war with Iraq. The administration and the House reached
an agreement Wednesday on language authorizing a resolution, and Sen.
Joseph I. Lieberman (D-Conn.) has introduced a resolution identical
to the House's. Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Joseph R.
Biden Jr. (D-Del.), a doubter on Iraq, acknowledged that the
resolution is gaining momentum.</LD>
<LD>   If the United Nations does not pass a stiff enough resolution on
weapons inspections in Iraq, Bush seems eager to go it alone.
Lawmakers who still have questions should not hesitate to raise them,
for the sake of public understanding if not in hope of significantly
amending the resolution.</LD>
<LD>   Voices of doubt do exist. Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle
skipped the Rose Garden ceremony at which the president hailed the
lawmakers' support for a resolution, though House Minority Leader
Richard A. Gephardt was at Bush's side. Daschle has said his aim is
to put greater emphasis on eliminating weapons of mass destruction
and on ensuring that a war, if it occurs, does not disrupt operations
against Al Qaeda. Among Republicans, Sen. Charles Hagel of Nebraska,
a decorated Vietnam veteran, has warned that the administration could
be headed into a new Vietnam.</LD>
<TE>   The House resolution does tap the brakes on the original White
House proposal. It calls upon the president to state that diplomacy
has been ineffective and limits the use of U.S. military force to
Iraq. It also requires Bush to report to Congress on military actions
and reconstruction activities. But the resolution is still quite
permissive and skirts the issue of postwar planning for Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   The many undiscussed problems include:</TE>
<TE>   * If a campaign against Iraq were to conclude quickly and
successfully, what would come after it? Iraq is a country riven with
ethnic conflicts--the Kurds in the north and the Shiites in the south
might seek to split off from Baghdad and create their own countries.</TE>
<TE>   * The dissident groups the Bush administration supports, including
the Iraqi National Congress, have spent more time fighting each other
than Saddam Hussein. Who knows if new leadership could emerge from
within Iraq's governing classes?</TE>
<TE>   * Iranian hard-liners might use war to grab territory from a
longtime enemy on its border. Would that mean U.S. troops along the
Iran-Iraq border?</TE>
<TE>   Hussein is a dangerous dictator who has used chemical and
biological weapons on his own people. But the White House has not yet
provided a persuasive reason why he merits a one-on-one war with the
United States, while the rest of the world, Britain possibly
excepted, waits on the sidelines.</TE>

<LD>Los Angeles County is the economic engine of the nation's most
populous state, and like more and more parts of the country, it's
packed with people who are unhealthy and uninsured. As a result, even
the county's rich and fully covered are increasingly at risk of
having no ER close or good enough to save them should they get in a
wreck or suffer a heart attack. So why is the Bush administration
weaseling away from the county's request for an emergency infusion of
cash for health care?</LD>
<LD>   In the late '90s, Washington agreed to give the county about $246
million a year in supplemental health funding. But on Monday,
President Bush's Medicare and Medicaid director, Tom Scully, told The
Times that additional cash would not be forthcoming. "We don't want
to create a meltdown of the L.A. County hospitals," Scully said. But,
he added, he doesn't want to have to "explain to Houston and New York
and St. Louis and Nashville why L.A. County is getting a special
deal."</LD>
<LD>   "I don't think it's our responsibility to just write them a check
and bail them out," he said.</LD>
<TE>   Scully's reasoning cries out for a phrase-by-phrase response.</TE>
<TE>   First, L.A.'s deal is not "special"--Scully has cut similar deals
1,950 times in the last two years. And they're not bailouts. The
deals give regions more cash than they would normally receive from
Medicaid--the federal- and state-financed insurance for the poor--in
exchange for a promise to serve patients more economically.</TE>
<TE>   Also, Scully can remind those other cities that they are already
getting plenty of help for their public health programs. Total
Medicaid spending per enrollee in fiscal year 1998 was $3,101 in
Texas, $7,180 in New York and $3,436 in Missouri. Nashville comes
closest to having a legitimate gripe. Spending in Tennessee in 1998
was $2,583, the lowest of any state--except California, where it was
$10 less. But Scully can point out to America's country music capital
that its population (a mere quarter the size of L.A.'s uninsured
population alone) isn't swelling because of Washington's failure to
control immigration at the border.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, Scully should know that the people of Los Angeles are not
asking him to "just write them a check." L.A. County has already
decided to close 11 health clinics and a trauma center in the
Antelope Valley and may soon close two more of these subsidized,
deal-with-any-problem emergency rooms.</TE>
<TE>   Germs don't quarantine themselves among the uninsured. And as any
ambulance driver will attest, it doesn't matter if the person on her
gurney is rich or poor, Republican or Democrat, he is just as likely
to die if there's nowhere to take him.</TE>

<LD>Since George Washington took the oath of office, U.S. presidents have
nominated 149 men and women to the Supreme Court and many more to the
federal courts of appeal and trial courts. In two centuries, the
Senate has rejected 11 Supreme Court nominees and an uncertain number
of prospective lower court judges. Seven others withdrew their high
court nominations, some to avoid likely defeat.</LD>
<LD>   The Senate has blocked ideologues, including die-hard Federalists
during the 18th and early 19th centuries, who it concluded would not
put aside their political beliefs on the bench. It killed the
nominations of men viewed as shills for special interests and
rejected others for being ethically compromised or simply not smart
enough or wise enough to sit on federal courts for life.</LD>
<LD>   That history matters as the Senate Judiciary Committee considers
Dennis Shedd, Michael McConnell and Miguel Estrada for seats on the
U.S. Court of Appeals. Republicans insist that the Senate panel, now
with a one-vote Democratic edge, has dragged its feet in confirming
President Bush's picks and that the tough questions senators have
asked these three men and others about their judicial philosophy and
temperament are a partisan effort to destroy the reputations of
qualified men and women. Neither charge holds water.</LD>
<TE>   In the 14 months since the Democrats took narrow control of the
Senate, the Judiciary Committee has confirmed 78 judges, 14 of them
to appellate courts. That compares with an average of 39
confirmations a year during the six-plus years of Republican control.</TE>
<TE>   The committee has readily approved men and women more centrist in
their views and more likely to be fair-minded on the bench. But
committee members are right to hesitate over Shedd, McConnell and
Estrada.</TE>
<TE>   Shedd has published a scant 60 opinions in 12 years as a judge. He
has backed employers against claims by workers almost without
exception. In criminal cases, he has generously interpreted the law
to favor police. He held quixotically that the federal family leave
law does not apply to state employees, a ruling that, by extension,
could invalidate other federal civil rights protections for state
workers.</TE>
<TE>   McConnell has repeatedly asserted that Supreme Court precedents
should not bind the current court. He has argued before the Supreme
Court that religious schools should receive certain types of
government aid on the same basis as public schools.</TE>
<TE>   Estrada, a corporate lawyer who helped make Bush's case in the
Florida recount battle, has virtually no public writings and no
judicial experience. The committee needs to see the memos he wrote at
the U.S. solicitor general's office, which Atty. Gen. John Ashcroft
has refused to release.</TE>
<TE>   The Senate's obligation in confirming judges is to the people, not
the president. All three men now before the Judiciary Committee
should give members pause.</TE>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Allied warplanes launched an airstrike in the southern "no-fly" zone
over Iraq after Iraqi aircraft penetrated the restricted area,
defense officials said Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   The strike brought to 45 the number reported this year by U.S. and
British patrols in the zones set up to protect Iraqi minorities after
the 1991 Persian Gulf War.</LD>
<LD>   The Iraqis "placed a mobile radar south of the 33rd parallel," the
boundary for the southern zone, said Navy Cmdr. Frank Merriman,
spokesman for the U.S. Central Command in Tampa, Fla. "And they flew
military aircraft into the zone."</LD>
<TE>   He declined to say how many aircraft.</TE>
<TE>   Coalition planes responded, targeting precision-guided weapons at
the mobile radar in the city of Al Kut on Tuesday, a statement from
the command said.</TE>
<TE>   It was the sixth time in a month that coalition aircraft have
struck at Al Kut, about 100 miles southeast of Baghdad. Pentagon
officials said Iraqis keep moving mobile radar to the area.</TE>
<TE>   The amount of any damage from Tuesday's strike was not known.</TE>

<HD>GI and Filipino Killed in Bombing</HD>
<DH>Military: A U.S. soldier is among those wounded. No group
takes responsibility, but Philippine officials blame terrorists.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD C. PADDOCK and AL JACINTO</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL>ZAMBOANGA CITY, Philippines</DL>
<LD>An American soldier and at least one Filipino were killed Wednesday
evening when a bomb went off in a market street frequented by U.S.
and Philippine troops in this turbulent southern city.</LD>
<LD>   The national police chief, Gen. Hermogenes Ebdane, blamed the Abu
Sayyaf terrorist group for the attack.</LD>
<LD>   The dead soldier, who was identified as an Army master sergeant,
was the first member of the American military in the Philippines to
die in an attack since the Pentagon sent U.S. troops to the Asian
nation early this year to aid government forces fighting terrorism.</LD>
<TE>   No one took responsibility for the blast, which injured an
American soldier and about two dozen other people, mostly civilians.</TE>
<TE>   But Ebdane said today that the rider of a motorcycle carrying the
bomb was identified as a member of Abu Sayyaf, Associated Press
reported.</TE>
<TE>   "It was the handiwork of the terrorists, and we condemn the
attack," Philippine army Col. Alexander Yapching, commander of an
anti-terrorist task force, said Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   The names of the two American victims were being withheld pending
notification of kin, Pentagon and U.S. Pacific Command officials in
Honolulu said. The soldiers were returning from a mission and had
stopped in a market area across the street from Camp Gen. Arturo
Enrile in Malagutay, about two miles from the main military base of
Camp Navarro, when the explosion occurred.</TE>
<TE>   There were reports that a second Filipino was killed and that one
of the dead was the bomber.</TE>
<TE>   Philippine military spokesman Brig. Gen. Eduardo Purificacion
said: "The biker stopped, then was checking his baggage when the bomb
went off. The blast tore the biker into pieces. We are still trying
to verify how many really died."</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. soldiers involved were assigned to the Joint Special
Operations Task Force, an elite group of about 270 American troops
deployed in the southern Philippines.</TE>
<TE>   More than 1,000 U.S. soldiers were sent here beginning in January
to help train Philippine troops in anti-terrorist techniques to
combat the Abu Sayyaf, a militant Islamic gang of kidnappers that the
U.S. government believes is linked to Osama bin Laden's Al Qaeda
network.</TE>
<TE>   The rebels kidnapped missionaries Martin and Gracia Burnham of
Kansas last year. He was killed during a rescue that freed her.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the American soldiers were withdrawn in July. Many of
those who remain are working on humanitarian and development projects
on the island of Basilan, once an Abu Sayyaf stronghold.</TE>
<TE>   Last week, Abu Sayyaf leader Khadafi Abubakar Janjalani contacted
the Radio Mindanao Network in Manila and said his group would attack
American civilian and military targets in retaliation for a
continuing government offensive against the rebels.</TE>
<TE>   Communist guerrillas also have been increasingly active in recent
weeks and have staged bold attacks on police stations, killing at
least two officers, wounding several others and seizing weapons.</TE>
<TE>   Philippine officials said the explosion Wednesday evening occurred
outside a karaoke bar that is owned by a former Philippine soldier.
However, Pentagon spokesman Cmdr. Randy Sandoz said the site of the
blast was an outdoor food stand. U.S. soldiers are not allowed to
drink except during a once-a-week "beer day" on base.</TE>
<TE>   The two American soldiers reportedly were dining when the blast
occurred just before 9 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   Witnesses said the explosion blew the roofs off several nearby
houses and shops.</TE>

<LD>Hundreds of thousands of Londoners struggled to get to their jobs as
a one-day strike by subway workers produced commuter chaos in the
British capital for the second time in a week.</LD>
<LD>   Businesspeople jogged in suits, backpacks strapped over their
shoulders. Others wobbled along on bicycles. Thames River bridges
were jammed with pedestrians.</LD>
<LD>   The strike was called to protest a 3% pay raise, which unions say
is too low. That increase boosted train driver pay to $48,474. The
unions are seeking a 5.7% hike.</LD>

disease, formally known as bovine spongiform encephalopathy. Before
the ban, France was Britain's biggest export market for beef.</LD>

<DL>BAGRAM AIR BASE, Afghanistan</DL>
<LD>Acting on a tip from the local governor, U.S. troops found bunkers,
fortifications and tunnels stuffed with truckloads of machine-gun
ammunition on a farm in central Afghanistan, the military said
Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   Col. Roger King at Bagram air base, the U.S. military headquarters
in Afghanistan, said Oruzgan province Gov. Jan Mohammed Khan alerted
U.S. troops about the cache, which was found near the town of Deh
Rawod.</LD>
<LD>   The troops needed three trucks to remove the ammunition Tuesday,
he said. The ammunition was hidden in two tunnels surrounded by
bunkers and "fighting positions" that appeared to be old, King said.
The troops used explosives to collapse the tunnels after removing the
ammunition.</LD>
<TE>   King said he was unsure how the governor learned about the cache.</TE>
<TE>   Since the fall of the Taliban regime last year, U.S. troops have
found dozens of arms caches.</TE>
<TE>   "Every bit we take out of circulation makes this place a little
safer," King said.</TE>

<HD>Clinton Critical of Bush Policies</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>WILLIAM WALLACE</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL>BLACKPOOL, England</DL>
<LD>Former President Clinton delivered a folksy but frequently sharp
critique of the Bush administration's foreign policy Wednesday,
telling an approving British audience that U.N. weapons inspectors
should be given one last crack at uncovering any Iraqi weapons of
mass destruction.</LD>
<LD>   "I agree with many Republicans and Democrats in America and many
here in Britain who want to go through the United Nations, to bring
the weight of world opinion together to offer one more chance to the
inspections," Clinton said to Labor Party activists gathered in this
Victorian resort town. "If the inspections go forward, and I hope
they will, perhaps we can avoid a conflict."</LD>
<LD>   While agreeing with the administration that existing U.N.
resolutions on Iraq "won't do the job," he noted that "it is
important to remember that Britain and the United States made real
progress with our international allies through the United Nations
with the inspection program in the 1990s."</LD>
<TE>   "The inspectors discovered and destroyed far more weapons of mass
destruction and constituent parts than were destroyed in the Gulf
War," Clinton said.</TE>
<TE>   British Prime Minister Tony Blair had invited the former president
to speak in Blackpool essentially as a character witness for his Iraq
policy--a delicate high-wire act that balances London's support for
Washington's threat to use force against Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein
with the overwhelming desire in Blair's country and Labor Party to
work through the United Nations.</TE>
<TE>   The two men formed a friendship during their overlapping time in
office and still speak to each other about once a month, said a Blair
advisor. But Clinton's political value to the prime minister now, the
advisor said, is that he "is still hugely popular with the Labor
Party," a swath of which is fiercely opposed to another Persian Gulf
war.</TE>
<TE>   It was a successful booking. Clinton threw his ex-presidential
weight behind Blair, arguing that Blair is right to see Hussein as a
threat, while repeatedly praising the prime minister for tempering
the Bush administration's instinct to deal with Iraq alone.</TE>
<TE>   "I support the efforts of the prime minister and President Bush to
get tougher with Saddam Hussein," Clinton said. "I strongly support
the prime minister's determination if at all possible to act through
the U.N." Notably, he omitted Bush's name from the latter statement.</TE>
<TE>   Clinton's 50-minute speech, though veiled in casual good humor and
interrupted to introduce his traveling companion, actor Kevin Spacey,
amounted to a raw attack on the man who replaced him in the Oval
Office. While declaring broad support for Bush's decision to confront
the menace posed by Hussein, Clinton noted that he had "a world of
disagreements" with the current administration, listing everything
from its rejection of the Kyoto Protocol on climate change to the
2001 Republican-sponsored tax cut.</TE>
<TE>   Many of his comments also carried personal overtones. Clinton
recited a list of what he termed the West's moral failures in Iraq,
which he said helped prop up Hussein's regime. Though not mentioning
him by name, Clinton cited then-President George Bush's handling of
the period immediately following the 1991 Persian Gulf War, when
U.S.-led coalition forces did not intervene while Hussein's forces
repressed a Shiite Muslim rebellion that Washington had encouraged.</TE>
<TE>   "The Shiites of the southeast of Iraq were urged to rise up and
then cruelly abandoned to their fate as [Iraqi forces] came in and
killed large numbers of them, drained the marshes and largely
destroyed their way of life," Clinton said. "We can't forget we are
not blameless in the misery under which they suffer."</TE>
<TE>   Clinton argued that the remnants of the Al Qaeda terrorist
network--not Iraq--pose the greatest threat to the United States at
the moment. "I still believe our most pressing security challenge is
to finish the job against Al Qaeda and its leaders, in Afghanistan
and any other place that they might hide," Clinton said.</TE>
<TE>   Driving Hussein from power should ideally be achieved through
"nonmilitary means," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The loudest applause was reserved for his swipes at what many in
Britain see as America's bullying style under Bush .</TE>
<TE>   "You can't have an integrated world and have your say all the
time," Clinton said. "America can lead the world" to a more
interdependent era, "but we can't dominate and run the world."</TE>

<HD>U.S. to Resume Its Effort to Help Colombia Intercept Drug
Flights</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>BOGOTA, Colombia</DL>
<LD>Eighteen months after an American missionary plane was accidentally
shot down, the United States will resume a campaign to help Colombia
track and force down drug flights, officials from both countries said
Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   The program was suspended in April 2001 in Colombia and Peru after
a Peruvian warplane mistakenly shot down the missionary flight over
the Amazon, killing an American woman and her infant daughter.</LD>
<LD>   Colombian warplanes will intercept drug flights based on
intelligence from the United States, Colombian air force commander
Gen. Hector Fabio Velasco said Wednesday. He said operations are
expected to resume this month.</LD>
<TE>   To prevent more accidental shoot-downs, Colombian ground and air
crews are receiving training in Oklahoma City, said U.S. Army Brig.
Gen. Galen Jackman.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. State Department will be the lead agency on the program.
Lawmakers recommended that the CIA no longer manage it.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. officials have said illicit drug flights from the Andes to
the United States increased after the suspension of the program.</TE>
<TE>   The missionary flight was shot down after a CIA surveillance plane
spotted what it considered a suspicious aircraft and called in a
Peruvian jet to intercept it. The U.S. crew later realized that the
plane was not on a drug flight, but it was unable to dissuade the
Peruvians from firing on it.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. Senate Intelligence Committee concluded that inadequate
Peruvian air traffic control, poor communications and inadequate
foreign language skills on both the CIA and Peruvian planes
contributed to the shoot-down.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. officials have said that in the resumed operations, all
personnel involved must be fluent in Spanish.</TE>
<TE>   Jackman said the campaign would resume over Peru at a later date.
Peruvian Foreign Minister Allan Wagner said Tuesday that Peru's war
on drugs will not succeed without the U.S.-backed interdiction
efforts.</TE>

<HD>Spruced-Up Berlin Gate Ready to Greet Germans for Unity Day</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEFFREY FLEISHMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>BERLIN</DL>
<LD>The men in yellow slickers worked in the autumn rain, climbing on
scaffolding, above stonemasons and architects, through the veiled
columns and beneath the bronze chariot of this city's most enduring
monument, where Michael Pauseback looked history in the eye and
proclaimed:</LD>
<LD>   "The gate is ready."</LD>
<LD>   After two years of being scoured of grime and draped in tarps, the
Brandenburg Gate will show its newly buffed face to the world today
as Germany celebrates Unification Day. The tarps are scheduled to be
dropped, and the gate--with a half-century of soot and grit burned
away by tiny lasers--will reclaim its majesty on Unter den Linden
boulevard.</LD>
<TE>   "It's an honor to have worked on it," said Pauseback, manager of
Caro Restoration and Technology Ltd., the company in charge of the
multimillion-dollar privately funded cleaning project. "We slept
every night with the responsibility of our work. In the back of your
mind, you know this is a symbol. And now that we're turning it back
over to the government, I have a feeling of emptiness, like one has
sending a child into the world."</TE>
<TE>   The Brandenburg Gate has belonged to the world's imagination as a
symbol of division since the construction of the Berlin Wall at the
height of the Cold War. The gate stood over a divided city and, like
Checkpoint Charlie and nuclear warheads, defined the struggle between
communism and democracy. Against its pocked, grizzled sandstone,
President Kennedy proclaimed that he was a Berliner and President
Reagan dared Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev to "open this gate
... tear down this wall."</TE>
<TE>   When the Berlin Wall fell in 1989, some of the most poignant
images of freedom came as East Germans rushed through the gate's 12
Doric columns and into the West. The gate in recent times has been a
backdrop for less lofty images, including tourist bus traffic and,
until recently, drunken New Year's Eve parties and the decadent
reveling of the Love Parade. And as much of the Berlin skyline glows
with the glass, steel and sharp angles of a new millennium, the
gate--built from 1788-91 for King Frederick William II--is a remnant
of Old World architectural charm.</TE>
<TE>   But it sure got dirty.</TE>
<TE>   "Look how black it was," said Pauseback, pointing recently to a
tiny square of grime that contrasted with the cleansed beige
sandstone, mined generations ago from pits along the Elbe River.
"Dust, smoke, a lot of it was biological. The rains and grit blowing
from the west over the decades made the western side black."</TE>
<TE>   Rain fell steadily as Pauseback, suffering from a cold, wrapped
his polka-dot scarf and zipped his leather jacket. He retreated to a
cafe in the shadow of the gate. He took paper and pen and drew
diagrams, explaining that the restoration was a mixture of
technological wizardry and historical sleuthing.</TE>
<TE>   The gate's first major repairs and rebuffing were done in the
mid-1950s, when many of its 18,000 nicks, scars and bullet holes from
World War II were patched. There was, however, a hidden defect left
behind. Examining photos taken decades ago by Josef Stalin's official
photographer, Pauseback said, he detected damage to column
three--probably caused by a mortar or tank shell--that had been
glossed over with cement.</TE>
<TE>   Gently chipping at the layer of cement, Pauseback said, his crew
found that much of the column had been blown away. Only a 6-inch
triangle of stone, he said, was left to support 320 tons, which
included the quadriga-crowned neoclassical frieze of the Goddess of
Victory, or, as she was originally conceived, the Goddess of Peace.</TE>
<TE>   "We had to replace the damage with an 8-ton stone," Pauseback
said. "Over the entire gate, we made 1,500 repairs."</TE>
<TE>   Cleaning the sheen of dirt stuck to the porous columns was tedious
work. Restorers used five lasers--costing $80,000 each--to remove
about one square yard of filth a day. "It's a strong, strong light,"
said Pauseback, a former publisher and art gallery owner, referring
to the lasers. "It's much like the technology in medical surgery. If
the laser detects something black, it turns the grime to gas but
doesn't damage or touch the stone."</TE>
<TE>   The work was done behind tarps and shrouds that were turned into
willowy billboards by the project sponsor, Deutsche Telekom.
Pauseback's work on the last of Berlin's 14 original gates will be
revealed this evening when former President Clinton and other guests
will watch as a huge zipper opens, peeling away the coverings.</TE>
<TE>   Rain turned to drizzle one day last week, and the team of
restorers knelt down on scaffolding. Laborers laid cobblestones at
the entrance of the gate. Around the corner, tourists lined up to
enter the clear dome of the Reichstag building. The well-to-do waited
for taxis in front of the remodeled Adlon Hotel, which was, along
with the Brandenburg Gate and a handful of other haunts, part of the
panorama for Berlin's jazzy nightlife in the years before the war.</TE>
<TE>   Sipping his coffee, the man whose company restored the gate
wondered whether new generations will value the emblems of the past.
Much of Berlin's architectural splendor was obliterated in air raids,
and the city today remains a place of reinvention, where more than
two dozen long-armed cranes swing across the horizon and dust rises
over the River Spree.</TE>
<TE>   The new construction, said Pauseback, is "glass and steel. The
soul is gone.... They're creating something just to fill in something
that was destroyed."</TE>
<TE>   The gate, he said, is one of the few symbols left. "I'm not sure
people of this century will be willing to accept symbols. Every day,
values are disappearing, symbols become less important. This century
lives for losing values and symbols, not for building them.... I
still believe in them, though."</TE>

<HD>N. Korea Offers More Details on Kidnappings</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>VALERIE REITMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>TOKYO</DL>
<LD>At least two special North Korean agencies were responsible for
kidnapping 13 Japanese--one more than previously acknowledged--during
the 1970s and '80s to provide language training and identities for
spies, officials in the Communist nation have told a team of Japanese
diplomats.</LD>
<LD>   The disclosure by Japanese officials Wednesday came as doubts
mounted about the details North Korea has provided concerning how
eight of the victims died, most in their 20s and 30s.</LD>
<LD>   Megumi Yokota, abducted at age 13, hanged herself from a pine tree
at 28 after being hospitalized for severe depression, the diplomats
were told. Two victims died of carbon monoxide poisoning, two were
killed in traffic accidents, one drowned, and two died of heart
disease or cirrhosis.</LD>
<TE>   All but one of their graves washed away in floods, North Korea
maintains.</TE>
<TE>   The Japanese said the newly identified kidnap victim, Hitomi Soga,
is alive and married to a former U.S. soldier living in North Korea.
The American--identified as Charles Robert Jenkins, now 62, of North
Carolina--defected in 1965 from his post in South Korea.</TE>
<TE>   In Washington, Lt. Col. Thomas Erstfeld of the Pentagon's
POW/Missing Personnel office confirmed that Jenkins defected to North
Korea as an Army sergeant, the highest-ranking of six defectors to
the country in the 1960s. Two defectors have since died. Erstfeld
said he did not know Jenkins' hometown or unit.</TE>
<TE>   Erstfeld said the Pentagon has made numerous requests for contact
with the defectors but that North Korea has always declined.</TE>
<TE>   North Korean leader Kim Jong Il first alluded to the purpose of
the kidnappings in his surprise acknowledgment and apology to
Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi at their meeting two weeks
ago. But because so few details were provided, Tokyo sent officials
from the Foreign Ministry to Pyongyang, the North's capital, for four
days this week to find out more.</TE>
<TE>   North Korea said nine of the 13 victims were abducted between 1977
and 1980 by agents working for a special agency that provided
Japanese-language training and identities stolen from the victims to
help spies more easily infiltrate South Korea.</TE>
<TE>   Members of another department kidnapped Japanese in Europe from
1980 to 1983 because "they didn't have their own contacts" to carry
out abductions in Japan, Japanese Deputy Cabinet Secretary Shinzo Abe
said.</TE>
<TE>   The Japanese officials were told that two senior North Korean
officials responsible for the kidnappings were tried in 1998. One was
put to death and the other sentenced to 15 years in prison.</TE>
<TE>   The North Koreans said seven of the victims were abducted by
agents and one by an unidentified intermediary. The other five were
lured to the North with job offers and promises.</TE>
<TE>   The North Koreans disclosed that Soga, the newly identified
victim, was taken in 1978 while shopping with her mother. She was 19
at the time. Soga and Jenkins married in 1980 and have two teenage
daughters.</TE>
<TE>   Soga told Japanese investigators that she was stuffed in a sack
and taken to Pyongyang, where she worked at a special agency. Her
mother has not been heard from since, although the North Koreans
insisted that only the younger Soga was kidnapped.</TE>
<TE>   The Japanese victims who remain alive in Pyongyang told the
investigators that they want to see their families but wish to stay
in North Korea because they have jobs there and their children don't
speak Japanese.</TE>
<TE>   The mission brought back photographs and videotapes of the
interviews, as well as some hair from Yokota's purported 15-year-old
daughter. The team met with a doctor who said he treated Yokota at a
psychiatric hospital for nearly two months in 1993.</TE>
<TE>   The Japanese were told that Yokota's North Korean husband brought
her to the hospital. She was withdrawn, wouldn't smile or open her
mouth, and barely ate, the doctor said. On a walk around the hospital
grounds, she tore a piece from her dress and hanged herself from a
pine tree.</TE>
<TE>   The teen identified as her daughter gave investigators a picture
of Yokota as an adult. On the back, the girl had written in Korean
that she "hopes to meet her grandmother." The picture bears some
resemblance to Yokota, "but we have our doubts as to whether it's
really her," said Sakie Yokota, the kidnap victim's mother.</TE>
<TE>   North Korea's latest details have brought condemnation from the
victims' families and opposition party leaders, who doubt their
veracity.</TE>
<TE>   "The families aren't sad--we're furious," said Takuya Yokota,
Megumi's brother.</TE>
<TE>   Liberal Party leader Ichiro Ozawa said the report seems "made up
well."</TE>
<TE>   "I have never seen such a mockery," he said. "I can't imagine a
Japanese government accepting such a ludicrous report."</TE>
<TE>   Nevertheless, Koizumi said he intends to press ahead with
bilateral meetings this month aimed at improving ties with North
Korea. "We need to keep absorbing the responses by North Korea, but
it seems that they responded with sincerity to the investigations,"
the prime minister said.</TE>

<HD>Ex-Bosnian Serb Leader Pleads Guilty at Tribunal</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>THE HAGUE</DL>
<LD>Abruptly reversing course at a U.N. tribunal Wednesday, a top Bosnian
Serb wartime politician pleaded guilty to persecuting non-Serbs in
the 1992-95 Bosnian war.</LD>
<LD>   In exchange, prosecutors dropped genocide and all other war crimes
charges against Biljana Plavsic, the only female suspect at the court
and the first Serb leader to admit responsibility for atrocities.</LD>
<LD>   Plavsic, one of the highest-ranking officials to come before the
International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia, pleaded
guilty to persecution on political, religious and racial grounds--a
crime against humanity that is punishable by up to life imprisonment.</LD>
<TE>   Speaking to the court by video link, the 72-year-old Plavsic
looked somber and pale.</TE>
<TE>   "I plead guilty," she answered when asked to respond to the
charge.</TE>
<TE>   The U.N. judges then ruled that Plavsic could remain outside the
tribunal's custody until sentencing in December.</TE>
<TE>   Plavsic surrendered in January 2001 but was released after nearly
eight months in detention at The Hague and flew back to Belgrade, the
capital of Yugoslavia, to wait out her trial. She initially pleaded
not guilty to the eight counts of war crimes for her alleged role in
widespread expulsions and executions of non-Serbs in
Bosnia-Herzegovina.</TE>
<TE>   Plavsic's lawyer, Eugene O'Sullivan, said that by "expressing her
remorse fully and unconditionally, Mrs. Plavsic hopes to offer some
consolation to the innocent victims--Muslim, Croat and Serb," and
invites other leaders to "examine their own conduct."</TE>
<TE>   Plavsic has in effect admitted planning and carrying out a Bosnian
Serb campaign to wipe out Bosnian Muslims and Croats from dozens of
municipalities.</TE>
<TE>   O'Sullivan denied that Plavsic, as part of a plea bargain with
prosecutors, had agreed to testify in the genocide trial of former
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic.</TE>
<TE>   Tribunal watchers have named Plavsic as a potentially important
witness in Milosevic's case. During the Bosnian war, she was a close
associate of former Bosnian Serb President Radovan Karadzic and is
believed to have inside information about Milosevic's regime.</TE>
<TE>   After the war, Plavsic succeeded Karadzic--Bosnia's top war crimes
fugitive--as the president of the Serb half of Bosnia, known as
Republika Srpska.</TE>

<HD>Ukraine Asks U.S. to Hand Over Tapes on Arms Sale</HD>
<DH>Europe: Insisting no Iraq sanctions were violated, official
says Kiev wants to inspect the alleged proof.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>KIEV, Ukraine</DL>
<LD>Ukraine's top prosecutor called on U.S. officials Wednesday to hand
over tape recordings that Washington says indicate that the former
Soviet state might have sold arms to Iraq with the approval of
President Leonid D. Kuchma.</LD>
<LD>   Washington suspended some aid to Kiev last month after the U.S.
said it had authenticated portions of tapes made by Kuchma's former
bodyguard in which the veteran leader allegedly gives the go-ahead to
sell a radar system to Iraq.</LD>
<LD>   But Prosecutor General Svyatoslav Pyskun said Washington had then
shut the door on Ukraine, refusing to allow Ukrainian experts to
inspect the tapes and prove that Kiev had not violated a U.N.
prohibition on arms sales to Baghdad.</LD>
<TE>   "We are ready to invite any expert to check, but ... give us the
original. They are offering us only edited versions," he said, adding
that he was sure Ukraine had not sold arms to Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   Kuchma, who is also under pressure over charges of corruption and
alleged ties to the slaying of a journalist, has repeatedly denied
selling arms to Iraq and has vowed to cooperate with any probe.</TE>

<HD>U.S. Losing Iraq Battle at the U.N.</HD>
<DH>Strategy: A majority on the Security Council appears wary
of using 'all necessary means.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MAGGIE FARLEY and ROBIN WRIGHT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>UNITED NATIONS</DL>
<LD>A day after Iraq opened the door to weapons inspections with some
limits, a tough U.S. proposal seeking "all necessary means" to force
full compliance with past U.N. resolutions appeared to be in trouble
Wednesday in the Security Council.</LD>
<LD>   With France proposing an alternative measure designed to delay
military intervention, several council members complained that the
American approach would more likely lead to war than prevent it.</LD>
<LD>   The shift in attitude, if it holds up, suggested difficult
negotiations still ahead for Washington.</LD>
<TE>   "Right now, the U.S. and U.K. don't have enough votes in favor of
their proposal," said Ginette de Matha, France's spokeswoman at the
world body. "The automatic use of military force is not acceptable."</TE>
<TE>   A Security Council resolution needs support of nine members--and
no veto by any of the five nations with permanent seats--the U.S.,
Britain, China, Russia and France. So far, only Britain has backed
the Bush administration's draft resolution, with Colombia hinting
that it might also support the measure.</TE>
<TE>   But encouraged by signs of cooperation by Iraq, the rest of the
Security Council seems to be leaning toward France's two-step
approach that first allows weapons inspectors a chance to establish
whether Iraqi President Saddam Hussein's regime has eliminated any
chemical, biological or nuclear weapons and the missiles that would
be used to deliver them. If Baghdad fails, the Security Council would
need to pass a second resolution authorizing military force.</TE>
<TE>   Though U.S. diplomats delayed the formal introduction of their
text in the face of the council's heightened resistance, they said
Wednesday that the U.S. would stand firm.</TE>
<TE>   "We'll work it out," said a senior State Department official. "We
have a history of prevailing, and we intend to."</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. has drafted a resolution that would give inspectors broad
new powers to hunt for suspected weapons of mass destruction and
provide them armed security while they conduct their search. If Iraq
does not accept the terms within a week of passage or fails to
disclose required information within 30 days, the resolution
authorizes "all necessary means" to force compliance--in other words,
a military attack.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. text, drafted in consultation with Britain, has other
requirements that Security Council members may resist. It demands
that Iraq fully disclose the extent of its weapons programs,
including the names of scientists who have worked on them. It
includes provisions for taking Iraqis and their families out of the
country for private interviews, which diplomats say would be an
invitation to defect. It also would allow any Security Council member
to place a representative on an inspection team to report back to his
or her home government, a provision that Iraq probably would view as
authorizing intelligence gathering.</TE>
<TE>   "We see it as a hard-line text designed for negotiation," said a
council diplomat who opposes the U.S. proposal. "These are terms
almost no one can accept. If we did, it would be an invitation for
war."</TE>
<TE>   Washington's hard-nosed strategy seems to have been undermined by
Iraq's last-minute softening at the two days of talks in Vienna this
week on inspections. Every Iraqi signal of cooperation--no matter how
grudging and limited--seems to bolster council resistance to the U.S.
strategy of "regime change."</TE>
<TE>   Hussein's pattern in the past has been to hold out until the last
moment, and then give in, said a diplomat close to the talks in
Vienna. That pattern seems to be at work again, and plays to
divisions within Washington and on the council.</TE>
<TE>   In the Vienna meeting, Iraqi officials agreed quickly to basic
logistical matters, such as where the inspectors would stay and
establish their bases, the diplomat said. The Iraqis eventually gave
in to unfettered visits to "sensitive sites," including mosques and
government buildings.</TE>
<TE>   But the Iraqi team refused to give up exemptions agreed to in 1998
with Secretary-General Kofi Annan for eight sites around Hussein's
presidential palaces.</TE>
<TE>   Today, U.N. chief weapons inspector Hans Blix will brief the
Security Council on the Vienna talks and describe what powers his
inspectors would need to do their job effectively. He said this week
that he could send advance teams to Iraq as early as Oct. 19. But the
U.S. insists that the teams wait for a new resolution that
strengthens their mandate and repeals conditions restricting
impromptu inspections of the eight presidential sites.</TE>
<TE>   In Washington, State Department spokesman Philip T. Reeker
insisted Wednesday on unfettered access to all sites, especially the
presidential palaces.</TE>
<TE>   "These are gigantic facilities, extremely well guarded, unknown
underground networks with unknown equipment and unknown activities,"
Reeker told reporters. "We're not talking Sleeping Beauty here, we're
talking massive structures, gigantic facilities, extremely well
guarded. What's he hiding?"</TE>
<TE>   He said the administration will not allow Hussein's regime to
"bamboozle" the United Nations.</TE>
<TE>   "If he's serious, if he means to comply with U.N. Security Council
resolutions to which he agreed, then he will open these things up,"
Reeker said. "He hasn't in the past. We've played this game, and
we're not going to play it anymore."</TE>
<TE>   As the U.S. worked to line up support among Security Council
members, administration officials outlined a strategy Wednesday that
concentrated first on winning over the Russians and then using that
success to pressure the French to back a tough resolution.</TE>
<TE>   In intensive discussions in Washington, New York and Moscow, U.S.
officials are pressing their Russian counterparts to sign on--in
exchange for significant economic benefits and a major role in Iraq
if Hussein's regime falls, said administration sources who requested
anonymity. The key incentive reportedly is an understanding that
Russia would play a prominent part in the political transition in
Baghdad, a means of helping Moscow secure a longer-term relationship
with a new government.</TE>
<TE>   There were hints Wednesday that the approach might be working,
with Russia indicating that it had softened significantly on its
earlier refusal to back any resolution.</TE>
<TE>   "If additional decisions are necessary for the efficient work of
the inspectors, we, of course, are ready to consider them," Foreign
Minister Igor S. Ivanov said in Moscow.</TE>
<TE>   For decades, Iraq has been Russia's closest ally in the Arab world
as well as a critical source of revenue from arms purchases. Since
the demise of the Soviet Union, which followed the 1991 Persian Gulf
War by less than a year, Moscow's influence among other
Arabs--including the Syrians, Algerians and Palestinians--has
dwindled significantly.</TE>
<TE>   "The government is under a lot of pressure domestically to have
guarantees that Russia will not lose its foothold in the Middle
East," said a State Department official who requested anonymity.</TE>
<TE>   The tactic worked a decade ago when the United States won
agreement from Russia to push for Middle East peace by making Moscow
a co-partner in mediating the Arab-Israeli dispute.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. also is discussing terms that would guarantee that any
new government in Iraq would repay $8 billion owed Russia for past
purchases. U.S. officials note that a significant chunk of the
money--possibly as much as 40%--comes from purchases since 1991 that
could be viewed as violations of U.N. economic sanctions.</TE>
<TE>   A new Iraqi government might opt to void any of the debt found to
be in contravention of international sanctions, U.S. officials say.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, the U.S. is discussing ways to ensure that Russia will
continue to be involved in Iraq's oil industry.</TE>
<TE>   In recent years, Moscow has signed a number of deals with Baghdad
for joint oil projects to take effect as soon as economic sanctions
are lifted, but a regime change could endanger those agreements.</TE>
<TE>   Even as Washington courts Russia, it is failing to win over its
usual European allies, who are frustrated by what they see as a
multiplicity of messages coming from the White House. The rationale
for regime change in Iraq has shifted--from the threat of suspected
weapons of mass destruction to accusations that Hussein's government
is linked to Al Qaeda to issues such as the persecution of his
country's citizens.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a problem," said Michael Stuermer, a respected political
commentator for the German daily Die Welt and former head of a German
government-financed political think tank. "There's no sense of
clarity. In matters of life and death, I want a position I can defend
clearly and logically, and that's not there."</TE>

<DL>KABUL, Afghanistan</DL>
<LD>The Kabul Zoo took delivery Wednesday of two lions to replace Marjan,
the one-eyed king of beasts who died this year after surviving more
than two decades of violence in the Afghan capital.</LD>
<LD>   The new lions, part of a menagerie that also included two deer,
two bears, two pigs and a wolf, were given by Beijing's Badaling
Safari Animal World.</LD>
<LD>   China's ambassador to Afghanistan, Sun Yuxi, said that the
donation was "a gesture of peace" and that Chinese experts would
teach Afghan zookeepers how to care for the newly arrived creatures.</LD>
<TE>   The heavily damaged zoo is in an area devastated by Afghanistan's
years of civil war.</TE>
<TE>   "We used to come when I was a boy, and you could spend all day
here," said 18-year-old Pervez, who, like many Afghans, uses one
name. "Now there's nothing. It's boring. We're tired of looking at
these same rabbits and monkeys."</TE>

<HD>Enron's Ex-Finance Chief Surrenders</HD>
<DH>Probe: U.S. prosecutors seek Andrew Fastow's cooperation in
pursuing higher-ups at the firm.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>EDMUND SANDERS and MEGAN K. STACK</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>HOUSTON</DL>
<LD>Andrew S. Fastow, the alleged financial mastermind behind the Enron
Corp. scandal, turned himself over to the FBI on Wednesday to face
criminal charges that he pocketed millions of dollars while
orchestrating a maze of illegal partnerships and secret deals.</LD>
<LD>   The development caps a stunning fall for Fastow, 40. Once one of
the most respected chief financial officers on Wall Street, he has
become a symbol of corporate greed.</LD>
<LD>   Still unknown is whether Fastow will turn on his former bosses.
The criminal complaint begins a dance between Fastow and federal
prosecutors over whether he will attempt to bargain away some charges
by offering to implicate former Enron Chief Executive Jeffrey K.
Skilling and former Chairman Kenneth L. Lay. Fastow also could
implicate Wall Street bankers who assisted in Enron's deals.</LD>
<TE>   So far, Fastow has refused to cooperate with the government's
probe of the fallen Houston energy giant, according to federal
prosecutors.</TE>
<TE>   By filing a criminal complaint and not moving immediately with an
indictment, federal prosecutors are giving Fastow a last chance to
cooperate, attorneys say. Under law, the government must file a
formal indictment within 30 days. After that, it becomes much harder
for both sides to cut a deal to reduce the charges against Fastow.</TE>
<TE>   "This gives them a little more flexibility," said Eric Holder, a
deputy attorney general during the Clinton administration. "The
government is looking for cooperation from him as it attempts to work
its way up the ladder."</TE>
<TE>   Deputy Atty. Gen. Larry Thompson, who is part of a multi-agency
Enron task force that includes the Securities and Exchange
Commission, the FBI and the Internal Revenue Service, said: "Fastow
and his co-conspirators systematically and thoroughly corrupted the
business of one of the largest corporations in the world." The SEC
filed its own civil complaint Wednesday against Fastow in U.S.
District Court in Houston.</TE>
<TE>   Thompson, speaking in Washington, alleged that Fastow siphoned $21
million in ill-gotten gains.</TE>
<TE>   In a statement Wednesday, Fastow's attorney said his client was
only doing his job, with the knowledge and approval of his superiors.</TE>
<TE>   "Enron hired Andy to arrange off-balance-sheet financing," said
John W. Keker, his attorney. "Enron's board of directors, its CEO and
its chairman directed and praised his work. Accountants and lawyers
reviewed and approved his work.... He never believed he was
committing any crime."</TE>
<TE>   Though Skilling and Lay were not named in the government's
complaint, it accuses Enron's "chief executive officer" of making
"false representations" to Enron's board about how transactions with
Fastow were approved and how much profit Fastow was permitted to earn
on the deals. Lay and Skilling each served as CEO during the relevant
time periods, setting off a guessing game about which one was
referred to in the complaint. Both have denied knowledge of any
wrongdoing in the past.</TE>
<TE>   Bruce Collins, an attorney for Lay, said he did not believe the
reference applied to his client and that there was nothing in Enron
board minutes or subsequent investigations that suggested that Lay
misled his fellow directors.</TE>
<TE>   "If anything, Mr. Lay was in the same position as the board,"
Collins said.</TE>
<TE>   Skilling's attorney declined to comment.</TE>
<TE>   Fastow ultimately could face as many as 45 years in prison,
depending upon the ultimate charges.</TE>
<TE>   If he does not cooperate, Fastow risks becoming the highest-
ranking Enron officer to be charged in the case, and he probably
would bear the brunt of the government's resources, attorneys
watching the situation said. The threat of charges against his wife,
who allegedly received kickbacks, also might be used by prosecutors
to pressure Fastow, they added.</TE>
<TE>   Enron filed for bankruptcy protection in December amid a wave of
accounting problems and investor panic over the company's use of
off-the-books partnerships to hide debt and boost profit.</TE>
<TE>   Rather than the creative accounting methods or "gray areas" once
described by Fastow to explain Enron's practices, the government's
35-page complaint alleges outright fraud, money laundering and
deceit.</TE>
<TE>   The partnerships, known as LJM, Southhampton and Chewco, were used
by Enron to meet financial targets on Wall Street by moving
money-losing investments, including a power plant in Brazil and
electricity-generating barges off the coast of Nigeria, off its
books, according to the complaint. In another deal, the government
said, Enron used a Fastow-controlled partnership to disguise the
company's interest in wind farms in California, thus enabling the
projects to continue to qualify for certain financial benefits.</TE>
<TE>   The complaint accuses Fastow of eliciting kickbacks for himself,
his wife and two young sons; lying to Enron's board of directors and
attempting to hide transactions from its auditor, Arthur Andersen;
and backdating contracts to lock in profits based on past stock
prices, a practice known as "Enron time machines." In all, the
government alleged, Fastow and his friends took in more than $37
million.</TE>
<TE>   A pale Fastow, wearing a charcoal suit and red tie, arrived early
Wednesday morning at the FBI's offices in Houston in the back seat of
his lawyer's Volvo. He waded silently through a crush of reporters
and surrendered to federal investigators. He emerged with hands
cuffed behind his back, climbed into a government Ford Taurus and was
driven to the federal courthouse.</TE>
<TE>   As he waited for his hearing to begin, Fastow sat straight and
tight-lipped in the empty jury box. When he faced U.S. Magistrate
Judge Marcia A. Crone, he answered, "Yes, ma'am" and "yes, your
honor."</TE>
<TE>   He was released on a $5-million bond, secured by $3 million in
cash and deeds to his Houston home, a vacation property and his
parents' house.</TE>
<TE>   Last month Fastow and his wife were forced to surrender their
passports. The Fastows are selling an 11,500-square-foot home they
are building in one of Houston's richest neighborhoods.</TE>
<TE>   The government said Wednesday that it planned to seize $11 million
more of Fastow's assets. In total, the government will seek the
forfeiture of more than $21 million from Fastow, Thompson said.</TE>
<TE>   Fastow has been virtually silent throughout the Enron scandal,
granting no interviews and issuing no apologies or explanations. When
called before Congress earlier this year, he asserted his
constitutional right not to testify.</TE>
<TE>   But government investigators believe that behind the half-smile he
often wears in public is a treasure-trove of information about
exactly what happened at Enron and who knew about it. Just as
Fastow's protege, Michael J. Kopper, pleaded guilty in August and
implicated Fastow in several deals, Justice Department attorneys hope
Fastow will provide information that may lead to indictments of
Skilling, Lay and other top officers.</TE>
<TE>   "Our Enron investigation is not over," said Linda Thomsen, deputy
director of enforcement at the SEC. "We will continue to work closely
with the Enron task force to bring to justice other responsible
parties and to get the full story of the Enron collapse to the
public."</TE>
<TE>   Wednesday's complaint mostly covered familiar territory because
many of Fastow's partnership deals had been reported. Still, the
document presented evidence of Fastow's push to enrich himself and
other investors at Enron's expense.</TE>
<TE>   The government, for example, alleged that Fastow had an
undisclosed agreement with Enron's chief accounting officer, Richard
A. Causey, that guaranteed that the Fastow-controlled LJM partnership
would be compensated for any losses it suffered. An attorney for
Causey did not return phone calls.</TE>
<TE>   Thompson alleged that Fastow benefited from the "active
cooperation of a large financial institution" that allowed Enron to
park a money-losing Nigerian power barge on the bank's books. The
bank, not named in the complaint, was revealed in congressional
hearings to be Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. Officials said Fastow pressured
Merrill to temporarily buy a $28-million interest in the barge,
promising to repurchase it at a later date.</TE>
<TE>   Merrill issued a statement Wednesday denying wrongdoing, although
also distancing itself from Enron.</TE>
<TE>   "Merrill Lynch never knowingly assisted Enron in falsifying its
financial results," the investment bank said. "Had we known in 1999
what is known today about the company, we would not have done
business with them."</TE>
<TE>   Thompson declined to say whether Lay, Skilling, Causey or Merrill
Lynch were targets in the investigation. Merrill Lynch said in an
August SEC filing that it had been told by Justice Department
officials that it was not a target.</TE>
<TE>   Convincing a jury of Fastow's guilt may prove difficult given the
complexity of the case, legal experts and government observers say.</TE>
<TE>   "These are some of the most intricate, complex facts I've ever run
into," said Rep. W.J. "Billy" Tauzin (R-La.), whose House Commerce
Committee has investigated numerous corporate meltdowns.</TE>
<TE>   At Fastow's court appearance in Houston, Diana Peters, 52,
applauded softly when he was led away. She has been unemployed since
she lost her job in Enron's information technology department last
year.</TE>
<TE>   "I have so waited for this day," Peters said. "It didn't just
affect me; it affected my whole family, the whole community. And he
needs to go to jail. People who steal go to jail."</TE>

<LD>Re "E. Timor Points a Way for Mideast," Opinion, Sept. 29: Ian
Urbina's article misses several major differences between East Timor
and the Mideast debacle. The East Timorese were hapless victims of
naked Indonesian aggression. Indonesia had nothing to fear from
losing control over East Timor. The Mideast conflict is a war with
two sides. The unconventional nature of suicide bombings negates the
effectiveness of U.N. peacekeepers. If Israel's world-class security
apparatus is unable to stop them, there is no way that the members of
the peacekeeping force could stop them. Those peacekeepers would, in
effect, become a shield from behind which suicide bombers could act
unabated. That is why the United States has vetoed intervention
proposals.</LD>
<LD>   The United Nations has repeatedly demanded that Israel commit
national suicide by abandoning self-defense. Right or wrong, most
nations of the world operate under the assumption that Israel's
existence is illegitimate. Some do not admit as much, but the voting
record of the U.N. illustrates this stance. It is this opinion that
must be changed if there is to be peace in the Middle East.</LD>
<TE>   Contrary to the expressed views of the Palestinian Authority,
withdrawing from the territories won't bring Israel security.
Palestinians are operating on the war-of-attrition model. Hamas
followers are not fighting for the West Bank and Gaza, they are
fighting for everything between Egypt, Jordan, Lebanon and the
Mediterranean. Full withdrawal and abandonment of settlements won't
stop anything.</TE>

<TE>   Re "Rights Group Decries Both Sides in Intifada for Endangering
Kids," Oct. 1: It has always been Palestinian policy to use children
and women as human-shield cannon fodder. Terrorists hide in churches,
schools and hospitals. The cowardice of putting the helpless in
harm's way as a tool of warfare has brought about the high death rate
for children.</TE>

the Sept. 18 feature story on the California Maritime Academy's
training ship, the Golden Bear. The picture showed alcoholic
beverages being carried aboard the ship. For the record, alcohol is
not allowed on board while the vessel is underway as a classroom at
sea. The supplies being loaded were for a community reception the
ship was hosting that day for alumni and friends while docked at the
port of Long Beach.</LD>

<LD>Re "State Sues Tribe Over Reporting of Gifts," Sept. 27: I have been
an ardent champion of tribal autonomy in the U.S. But I find certain
inconsistencies when tribes try to overreach in justifying their
"sovereignty." In the case of not acknowledging their obligation to
report election contributions to the Fair Political Practices
Commission, I contend that they are indeed asserting sovereignty and
therefore should be denied the option to contribute, since they are
tantamount to a foreign country. Can't have it both ways.</LD>
<LD>   However, keep in mind that all individual Indians--and that, of
course, includes the officers of a tribe who vote to support
candidates--are citizens, and each can make a financial contribution.
I suspect that the Political Reform Act of 1974 does apply to tribes,
but I am neither an attorney nor a judge.</LD>

and unsupportable assumption that all Latinos are interchangeable,
that whether you have a Samuel Paz or a Miguel Estrada on the federal
bench makes no difference, so long as the surname is Latino.</LD>
<LD>   The current administration has made ideology the primary factor in
choosing federal judges in an effort to use the courts to force a
reactionary change in our society. To identify and resist such an
effort is not overheated "political melodrama" and far, far from
politics as usual.</LD>
<TE>   The vast majority of Americans would never vote for, or accept,
the social changes--the evisceration of civil rights and
antidiscrimination laws, the elimination of reproductive rights and
environmental protection, the crippling of government's ability to
protect individuals from corporate wrongdoing--that these
ultraconservative nominees, such as Estrada, seek to accomplish
through the courts. Why should we permit the federal bench to be
filled with those who will use poorly understood, far-right legal
theories to turn back the clock, whatever their ethnic background or
gender?</TE>

any judicial position for experience!</TE>

<HD>Sanitizing a Film Is Not Censorship</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>I was surprised and dismayed by John Balzar criticizing those who are
earnestly trying to clean up films ("Censorship Chews a Hole in Our
Cultural Fabric," Commentary, Sept. 29). His technique of equating
editing films with editing great writings like Ernest Hemingway's is
a joke. There is no comparison here. Films are entertainment in about
99% of the cases, and you never hear the directors complaining about
films shown on airplanes, all of which have been modified in one way
or another.</LD>
<LD>   Those of us who do not need to hear the F-word one more time and
who can do without meaningless blood and gore (please let us use our
imaginations!) are happy that somebody is doing something about
cleaning up films.</LD>
<LD>   Now the directors could take a cue here. They usually film about
six takes per scene, and one of those could be the G- or PG-type
scene. Thus, a film could be distributed as both a G- or PG- and an
R-rated film at the same time. What a simple way to increase
revenues.</LD>

<LD>Re "Stage Set for More Port Labor Strife," Sept. 29: The

painters union fears its members may become more productive with
wider brushes, or the construction workers union fears its members
may become more efficient with heavier hammers. Sheesh.</LD>

<HD>Forge an Agreement With Iraqi Leader on Sanctions</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Our biggest problem is our admitted desire for a "regime change" in
Iraq. Saddam Hussein would have to be mad to let U.N. inspectors
destroy all his weapons of mass destruction, leaving him defenseless.
The solution is a deal. The U.N. gets to destroy all the weapons of
mass destruction and be permitted to conduct unfettered inspections
for as long as it considers the regime to be a danger. In return, the
U.N. will lift all sanctions and promise not to attack, provided Iraq
does not support any attack on any other country and keeps to the
deal.</LD>

<TE>   I am one of a few rare U.S. citizens who has lost his home in a
war. My family's house was destroyed by a B-29 bombing in a
residential area in Tokyo early in 1945. I was 4; I suffered
malnutrition for a long time even after the war ended. My mother
almost died of pneumonia.</TE>
<TE>   If the U.S. homeland had ever gotten the same amount of bombings
per population from another nation, President Bush would not so
easily decide on attacks. Women and children suffer the most in wars,
not dictators. Japan's Emperor Hirohito was allowed to live and stay
in his position for many years, while millions of civilians were
killed in the war. U.S. world policies must consider the civilians on
the other side, who are much more vulnerable than those here.</TE>
<TE>   Bush is, however, clearly correct about one thing. A nation should
not have biological, chemical and nuclear weapons. The U.S. cannot be
an exception. We have to practice what we preach.</TE>

<TE>   Steve Lopez's Sept. 29 column ("There's No Telling Where a War
With Iraq May Take Us") is amazing. He starts off by telling us that
national polls are not to be trusted and then concludes his column by
asking if we want another poll. Does he really think his column is
going to change things and, moreover, suddenly make national polls
trustworthy? Even our so-called allies, who are against an Iraq
attack, acknowledge the threat Hussein poses.</TE>
<TE>   Yes, of course there are very great risks in any war, especially
postwar developments. However, Germany and Japan are shining examples
of what may be. What's painfully missing from his column is what
alternatives to an Iraq attack Lopez suggests. If it is for us to sit
on our hands and continue blowing hot air, then we deserve what's
coming ... and that's the bottom line.</TE>

<HD>Mayor Shows a Bolder, Politically Savvy Side</HD>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>By selecting William J. Bratton to run the Los Angeles Police
Department, Mayor James K. Hahn made a bold move that shows he is
willing to share the limelight with a New York law-and-order cop--if
that's what it takes to fight crime and turn around the LAPD.</LD>
<LD>   It was a gutsy choice, many Los Angeles political observers said
Wednesday, because of Bratton's stature and because Hahn rejected the
advice of those who preferred safer alternatives.</LD>
<LD>   In picking his chief, Hahn ignored City Council members who
favored Oxnard Police Chief Art Lopez and overruled some advisors who
recommended former Philadelphia Police Commissioner John Timoney.</LD>
<TE>   Hahn was criticized during his first year in office for being too
low-key, uncomfortable in the ceremonial parts of his job and uneasy
with the media attention. Appointing Bratton sends a different
message, Hahn supporters and critics agree: It demonstrates a mayor
willing to take risks.</TE>
<TE>   If Bratton delivers crime reductions on the order of what New York
experienced in the 1990s, it would strongly bolster Hahn's standing;
if he fails to take command of the LAPD or to produce results, Hahn
will suffer along with him.</TE>
<TE>   "The person who will take the blame if this does not work out is
not the [City] Council; it's Jim Hahn," said Rafael Sonenshein, a Cal
State Fullerton professor and author. "He's totally on the line."</TE>
<TE>   Bratton's appointment immediately takes on importance in the
debate over San Fernando Valley secession and could well figure in
Hahn's expected bid for reelection in 2005.</TE>
<TE>   Conservative Welcome?</TE>
<TE>   Even before he begins work, Bratton's reputation as a crime
fighter is likely to be welcomed in the same conservative quarters
where support for secession is strongest and where voters helped Hahn
beat former Assembly Speaker Antonio Villaraigosa last year.</TE>
<TE>   The choice of Bratton was Hahn's second high-profile move
regarding the LAPD's leadership this year. His decision to oppose
former Police Chief Bernard C. Parks' bid for a second term was an
indication that the mayor was willing to offend in order to take
control of the LAPD. That cost Hahn some support among African
Americans and other Parks backers, but also helped dispel the notion
that he was a cautious incrementalist.</TE>
<TE>   'Bratton Is the One'</TE>
<TE>   "I think the fact that Hahn was willing to oppose Parks for
reappointment showed that Hahn was willing to be bold rather than
cautious in this area," said Erwin Chemerinsky, a constitutional law
professor at USC. "He concluded that the department really needs
reform, and Bratton is the one to do it."</TE>
<TE>   Jaime Regalado, director of the Pat Brown Institute at Cal State
Los Angeles, agreed.</TE>
<TE>   "Hahn wants the perception out there that he is bolder than we
thought," he said. "Hahn is signaling a bold move, picking the person
with the strongest record of reform, and that he is not worried about
Bratton answering to him or overshadowing him."</TE>
<TE>   Bill Wardlaw, an attorney and close advisor to Hahn, said such
reactions show that the best decision on the merits was also the best
decision politically.</TE>
<TE>   'A Real Tough Decision'</TE>
<TE>   "It's going to slowly sink in: This guy made a real tough decision
on doing what was right for the LAPD," Wardlaw said. "It is hard to
criticize the selection of this guy."</TE>
<TE>   Hahn was praised Wednesday by those who have run campaigns against
him as well as by those who supported him.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it shows a lot of self-confidence on his part," said
Parke Skelton, a political consultant who ran Villaraigosa's mayoral
campaign against Hahn. Bratton is "a high-profile man who likes the
limelight and likes to take credit for things."</TE>
<TE>   In another sense, the choice reflects something about both Hahn
and the city that elected him.</TE>
<TE>   Race Wasn't a Big Issue</TE>
<TE>   For the first time in a decade, the debate over who was best
suited to lead the LAPD did not revolve significantly around the race
of the contenders. Some praised Hahn for ignoring those
considerations.</TE>
<TE>   "It shows a lot of courage because he didn't try to favor the
black community or the Hispanic community," said former LAPD Chief Ed
Davis, who went on to a career in elected office and remains a
sought-after expert on policing and political issues.</TE>
<TE>   "I think the mayor is surprising people. You wouldn't expect him
to be a bold, dynamic mayor, but now he's beginning to look like a
bold, dynamic mayor."</TE>
<TE>   If Hahn can maintain his image as a decisive leader, particularly
in the area of law enforcement, that could affect his expected bid
for reelection in 2005, some political advisors say.</TE>
<TE>   Like Richard Riordan before him, Hahn has identified public safety
as an integral part of his platform, and success at the LAPD would
bolster his chances at winning office again.</TE>
<TE>   The debate over the chief already has damaged him in one part of
his political coalition: the African American community, which voted
for him overwhelmingly in 2001.</TE>
<TE>   In that campaign and throughout his political career, Hahn had the
strong backing of blacks, partly as a result of the long-standing
affection in that community for his father, a beloved former county
supervisor.</TE>
<TE>   "People in my community have long memories, and a lot of pain and
disappointment remains," said John Mack, president of the Los Angeles
Urban League.</TE>
<TE>   "The selection of Bratton can maybe improve those relations, but
not everyone is ready to kiss and make up," Mack added.</TE>
<TE>   If Parks' ouster tarnished Hahn's reputation among some African
Americans, however, Bratton's appointment may help bolster his
standing among moderates and conservatives, especially in the Valley.</TE>
<TE>   Those voters represent the other half of the coalition that helped
Hahn beat Villaraigosa last year.</TE>
<TE>   "I think the more vision the mayor shows with appointments and
policies, the easier it will be for him to get reelected," said Carol
Schatz, president and chief executive of the Central Cities Assn. "It
showed courage. It showed vision. People want that from a mayor."</TE>
<TE>   But closer still is the November vote on secession. The mayor
opposes efforts to form separate cities in Hollywood and the San
Fernando Valley.</TE>
<TE>   Bratton's record as a crime fighter and his marquee value may
speak to residents of those areas. And from the outset, Hahn is
bragging in the heart of the secession area about his choice.</TE>
<TE>   The formal announcement of Bratton's appointment--and the first
joint appearance of the mayor and his new chief--will take place this
morning in North Hollywood.</TE>
<TE>   "Not too many things don't get announced in the Valley these
days," Sonenshein said. "Whether this succeeds or not is of such
fundamental importance to the city, it's like war and peace questions
in Washington."</TE>

<HD>Hahn Picks Bratton to Lead Police Force</HD>
<DH>LAPD: The mayor's choice was in charge in New York when
crime dropped substantially, but some objected to his high-profile
style.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TINA DAUNT and GEOFFREY MOHAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>William J. Bratton, the brash former boss of the New York City Police
Department, was tapped Wednesday by Mayor James K. Hahn to lead the
Los Angeles Police Department, city officials said.</LD>
<LD>   Hahn informed City Council members of his decision Wednesday
afternoon and was expected to formally announce his choice this
morning at the North Hollywood police station.</LD>
<LD>   Bratton gained nationwide fame during his two-year tenure as New
York City police commissioner because he oversaw a steep drop in
crime. His selection to head the LAPD provoked widespread praise from
political leaders and the police rank and file--and only muted
disappointment from others.</LD>
<TE>   Hahn has characterized the selection of a police chief as the most
important of his administration and has said the LAPD is a deeply
troubled institution in need of strong leadership.</TE>
<TE>   His choice of an outsider disappointed many council members and
LAPD officers who had supported Oxnard Police Chief Art Lopez, the
only Latino candidate and the only one on the list with LAPD
experience.</TE>
<TE>   Others had considered former Philadelphia Police Commissioner John
Timoney, once a deputy to Bratton, a formidable blend of
old-fashioned beat cop and progressive intellectual.</TE>
<TE>   Police Commission President Rick Caruso, who led the five-month
search for police chief candidates, praised the choice, as well as
what he described as Hahn's "very careful and methodical"
deliberations.</TE>
<TE>   "He's been tested," Caruso said of Bratton. "He knows the players.
He's an incredibly accomplished guy. We had three great choices, but
I think Bill is the best of the best. We need that to make Los
Angeles the safest big city in the country.</TE>
<TE>   " ... I thought he could hit the ground running," added Caruso,
who along with the mayor was impressed by Bratton's knowledge of the
department.</TE>
<TE>   Bratton, who could not be reached for comment Wednesday, could
begin work as early as next week if a majority of council members
approve the appointment, as expected.</TE>
<TE>   Councilman Jack Weiss, a Bratton backer, called the nod "a
terrifically strong choice. Bill Bratton will come to Los Angeles and
turn the LAPD around. It's an on-the-merits pick, and that's good
news for the city."</TE>
<TE>   Capt. Jim Tatreau, who heads the department's Robbery-Homicide
Division and is president of the Command Officers Assn., said Bratton
is the right choice not only because of his considerable experience
but also his proven record of reducing big-city crime.</TE>
<TE>   "While in New York, he demonstrated that he knew how to reduce
crime on city streets, and we absolutely need that here," Tatreau
said. "Crime reduction has not gotten the emphasis at all times that
it should in this city, and Bratton will make it a top priority....
Los Angeles street cops are going to be excited to come to work for
Bill Bratton."</TE>
<TE>   The president of the police union, Mitzi Grasso, agreed that
officers will get behind Bratton. "This selection will not only
create a better department but a safer city. We are looking forward
to working with Chief Bratton. I left him a message on his voice mail
saying, 'Hey, boss....' "</TE>
<TE>   Councilman Eric Garcetti was among those who pushed for Lopez.
"There were all kinds of reasons we could have gone with other
people, and some of us may have preferred other candidates, but this
is the mayor's hour and we need to get behind his choice," Garcetti
said.</TE>
<TE>   Bratton will inherit a department contending with low officer
morale, a shortage of 1,000 officers, a rising crime rate and a slate
of court-ordered reforms.</TE>
<TE>   Lopez, a former LAPD deputy chief, said he was disappointed and a
little surprised, but not envious.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it's going to be a really difficult situation for him,"
he said of Bratton.</TE>
<TE>   Timoney said he will not comment publicly until the decision is
announced by Hahn.</TE>
<TE>   The mayor called Lopez about 1:40 p.m., but did not explain why he
chose Bratton, the Oxnard chief said.</TE>
<TE>   "But I really think the fact that he had that big-city experience
was probably the biggest selling point to the mayor," Lopez said. "I
just told him that I was disappointed but I thought he was doing
what's right for the city of Los Angeles, and that I feel confident
that Bill Bratton would do a good job for the city."</TE>
<TE>   Insiders said Hahn started leaning toward Bratton after his first
interview last week, shortly after the Police Commission gave the
mayor its list of finalists. But Hahn continued to meet with top
advisors late into the night Tuesday, and reconvened them Wednesday
morning.</TE>
<TE>   "I gave the mayor my advice, and I know he talked to a lot of
people," Caruso said. "As of last night, the mayor was still giving
it a lot of thought."</TE>
<TE>   Those familiar with the selection process said the 54-year-old
former NYPD commissioner demonstrated an "intimate knowledge" both of
the LAPD and Los Angeles, garnered during his year spent as a member
of the team overseeing the Police Department's compliance with a
federal consent decree.</TE>
<TE>   Bratton left that team after he decided he wanted the chief's job.
He enjoyed the backing of public figures such as
businessman-philanthropist Eli Broad. He also spent time with members
of the Christopher Commission--which recommended widespread changes
in the LAPD after the 1991 Rodney King beating--and met with current
and former police commissioners, including Gerald Chaleff, who
advised Bratton in his quest for the post.</TE>
<TE>   "He's been successful in improving every department that he has
headed," said Chaleff, who is senior advisor to City Atty. Rocky
Delgadillo. "His reforms have been maintained in each one of those
departments. He will provide the Los Angeles Police Department with
the leadership to improve the morale of the officers of the
department and will assist the city in completing the tasks required
in the consent decree."</TE>
<TE>   Aware that he brought with him an outsized reputation in a
laid-back political city, Bratton reached out to community leaders
during his campaign, and was the only candidate to approach the Los
Angeles Urban League, said its president, John Mack.</TE>
<TE>   "That said something to me about his desire to work in partnership
with the various segments of Los Angeles as he tries to get a handle
on running that department," Mack said.</TE>
<TE>   "In my opinion he possesses the track record, the leadership
that's going to be required to really turn the institutional culture
of the LAPD around, to bring about the kind of lasting, long-term
reform that needs to be brought about," he added. "He will have his
hands full. It will not be an easy task."</TE>
<TE>   Bratton, who headed the NYPD from 1994 to 1996, is not shy about
touting his own achievements, including a crackdown on crime--from
the petty to the felonious--that provoked a reexamination of police
methods nationwide. On his watch, serious felonies--murder, rape,
robbery and the like--dropped by a third. The homicide rate was cut
in half.</TE>
<TE>   Experts continue to argue over whether Bratton's tactics or
economic and demographic changes were mainly responsible for the
decline.</TE>
<TE>   Nonetheless, Bratton became a celebrity and penned an
autobiography, "Turnaround." But his upstaging of former Mayor
Rudolph Giuliani proved his undoing, and he was forced from office
after a public and bitter feud.</TE>
<TE>   As a result, Bratton worked hard to portray himself as a team
player who will serve at the will of Hahn.</TE>
<TE>   "Obviously Jimmy was sufficiently comfortable that there is not
going to be a one-act show in the Police Department," said Melanie
Lomax, president of the Police Commission in 1991 and 1992. "I think
Bratton understands who his boss is, but he has enough of a
commanding presence to win the respect of the rank and file."</TE>
<TE>   Bratton faces a daunting task, both within the ranks and on the
streets. As the fourth chief in 10 years, he will take over a
department wounded by the King beating a decade ago and stung by more
recent corruption scandals. In addition, violent crime has risen in
recent years after falling through much of the 1990s.</TE>
<TE>   Bratton will have to combat crime with a much smaller force spread
out over a much larger territory than he did in New York. The NYPD
has about 40,000 officers, compared with 9,025 in Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   During the last year of his tenure, former LAPD Chief Bernard C.
Parks was roundly criticized for failing to stem three successive
years of increasing violent crime, particularly homicides.</TE>
<TE>   After hitting a 30-year low of 419 killings citywide in 1998, the
homicide rate rose more than 40% through 2001, when the city logged
579 slayings, according to LAPD crime statistics.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the killings occurred in the urban core, where less than
half of the city's 3.7 million people reside, but where three-fourths
of the homicides occur.</TE>
<TE>   Dean Hansell, former vice president of the Police Commission, said
he thought Bratton would be up to the task.</TE>
<TE>   "He really is one of the top cops in the United States," Hansell
said. "He's a strategic thinker."</TE>

Professor</HD>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Robert Hoffpauir, a longtime geography professor at Cal State
Northridge who headed his department's graduate studies program, has
died. He was 59.</LD>
<LD>   Hoffpauir, a resident of Tehachapi, was killed Tuesday in a
Lancaster traffic accident on his way to campus.</LD>
<LD>   Colleagues said he was a popular instructor who had a deep passion
for other cultures and for traveling. Hoffpauir specialized in
cultural geography, which analyzes how humans affect the landscape
with buildings, farming, manufacturing and other activities, said
Antonia Hussey, head of the geography department.</LD>
<TE>   "He was very highly regarded by our students," Hussey said
Wednesday. "We've been receiving e-mails all morning."</TE>
<TE>   Hoffpauir had been a CSUN instructor since 1971 and was appointed
to run the graduate studies program about eight years ago. He
recently co-published a paper on the weaving tradition in Mexico,
examining how villagers use a plant commonly found in the landscape
to create fiber for their craft, Hussey said.</TE>
<TE>   Hoffpauir traveled widely in Europe, China, Nepal and Central
America, and used his travels to take photographs for his classes,
friends said. "He had a joyful sense of life, and he loved to see new
places," Hussey said.</TE>
<TE>   He obtained his bachelor's degree from UC Berkeley and his
doctorate from the University of Wisconsin.</TE>
<TE>   CSUN will hold a memorial service on a date to be announced,
Hussey said.</TE>
<TE>   Funeral arrangements are pending. A list of survivors was not
available.</TE>

<HD>Ellis Larkins, 79; Pianist Played With Leading Jazz
Musicians</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JON THURBER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Ellis Larkins, a pianist whose elegant touch made him one of the most
sought-after accompanists for the leading figures in jazz, including
singers Mildred Bailey, Joe Williams and Ella Fitzgerald, has died.
He was 79.</LD>
<LD>   Larkins died Sunday of pneumonia at a hospital in his hometown of
Baltimore after a long illness.</LD>
<LD>   "When I think of Larkins, the word that comes to mind is 'taste,'
" jazz critic Nat Hentoff said Wednesday.</LD>
<TE>   "Few jazz pianists have the ability to be as unobtrusive as
Larkins was, not only when he was accompanying singers or
instrumentalists but even when he was soloing."</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, Larkins' sophisticated playing may be best remembered on
two recording sessions with Fitzgerald for Decca in the 1950s. Those
sessions produced albums that are considered to be classics in her
vast catalog: "Ella Sings Gershwin" and "Songs in a Mellow Mood."</TE>
<TE>   The oldest of six children, Larkins was born into a musical
family. His father played violin in the City Colored Orchestra in
Baltimore and his mother played piano. His sisters and brothers
played instruments or sang in local choirs.</TE>
<TE>   Larkins was considered a prodigy. He started learning the violin
at age 2 and the piano at 4. At 11, he made his debut with the City
Colored Orchestra and continued to play classical works at schools
and churches throughout the city.</TE>
<TE>   When First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt visited the city in 1935 to mark
the National Urban League's 25th anniversary, Larkins was selected to
perform. He played Moszkowski's Waltz in E major and an encore. He
would later recall that Roosevelt called him back on stage.</TE>
<TE>   "She told me that I'd be a great musician, and she shook my hand,"
Larkins recalled in an interview with the Baltimore Sun some years
ago. "It meant a lot to me. After all, she was the first lady of the
land."</TE>
<TE>   During high school, Larkins continued his classical music studies
at the Peabody Conservatory but was becoming interested in jazz,
especially the piano work of Fats Waller, Count Basie, Earl Hines and
Teddy Wilson.</TE>
<TE>   He left Baltimore after graduating from high school in 1940 and
moved to New York City to attend Juilliard on scholarship, still
intent on becoming a classical pianist.</TE>
<TE>   But needing money to live on, he found work in a jazz trio led by
the guitarist Billy Moore. Through the 1940s and '50s, Larkins worked
steadily in New York clubs and cabarets, generally in groups led by
others. The self-effacing Larkins seemed content just to have the
steady work.</TE>
<TE>   He also became a much-in-demand vocal coach and session player,
recording with singers Helen Humes, Bailey and, later, Fitzgerald.</TE>
<TE>   Larkins would say that the session work and vocal coaching kept
him alive when rock 'n' roll became increasingly popular in the
1960s.</TE>
<TE>   In a biography of Fitzgerald, author Stuart Nicholson wrote of
Larkins, "He creates a setting in which her voice sounds profound;
through allusion and elision he fragments the song and reassembles
it, thus assuming a greater logic as a backdrop to Ella's voice."</TE>
<TE>   "He wanted to let the music speak," Hentoff said Wednesday. "He
knew how to use silence between notes to add to the elegance of what
he was playing. He was unobtrusive, but his work stayed with you."</TE>
<TE>   Larkins moved to Southern California in the late 1960s and became
Williams' accompanist, leading a trio backing the singer for much of
the next two decades.</TE>
<TE>   He returned to Baltimore in the late 1980s.</TE>
<TE>   He made solid duo recordings with Williams and the cornetist Ruby
Braff and also accompanied poet Rod McKuen on a number of albums in
the 1970s.</TE>
<TE>   Larkins is survived by his wife, Crystal, and a sister, Clara
Larkins Bailey, both of Baltimore.</TE>

<HD>Kathleen McGrath, 50; 1st Woman to Command a U.S. Navy
Warship</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELAINE WOO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Capt. Kathleen McGrath, who made history as the first woman to
command a Navy warship, died of lung cancer Sept. 26 at the National
Naval Medical Center in Bethesda, Md. She was 50.</LD>
<LD>   In the spring of 2000, McGrath led the frigate Jarrett and its
crew of 262 from San Diego to the Persian Gulf to intercept oil
smugglers. She had taken the helm of the ship in 1998, four years
after Congress relaxed the rules that had barred women from combat
ships.</LD>
<LD>   Her command marked a milestone in the history of what had been a
man's Navy for two centuries.</LD>
<TE>   Progress began slowly in 1948, when women were allowed to enlist
in the regular Navy. The first women entered the Naval Academy almost
30 years later, in 1976. A woman took command of a noncombat ship for
the first time in 1990.</TE>
<TE>   Three years after the Air Force's groundbreaking decision to let
women fly combat jets, the Navy in 1994 made women eligible to
command warships.</TE>
<TE>   McGrath was one of five women given combat ship commands in 1998.
Four were assigned to lightly armed amphibious transport vessels;
McGrath got a warship capable of massive firepower.</TE>
<TE>   Although one of the smallest warships in the Navy fleet, the
Jarrett carried 1,100-pound Standard missiles, powerful enough to
destroy enemy aircraft from 20 miles away. It also had Harpoon
missiles, two Seahawk helicopters, torpedoes and anti-aircraft
weaponry.</TE>
<TE>   McGrath told Time magazine she did not view the job as an
opportunity to prove that she could be as tough as a male commander.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't try to emulate a man, nor do I try to do what a guy would
do," said McGrath, a mother of two who played the violin in her
stateroom for relaxation. "I have to be myself."</TE>
<TE>   Born in Columbus, Ohio, she was the daughter of a 29-year Air
Force veteran who spent her teenage years at a U.S. base on Guam
while her father flew B-52 bombers over North Vietnam.</TE>
<TE>   After high school she studied forestry at Cal State Sacramento,
and earned a degree in 1975. She spent the next several years with
the U.S. Forest Service.</TE>
<TE>   When she grew restive in that work, her father encouraged her to
consider the military.</TE>
<TE>   Intending to continue a family tradition, she went to the Air
Force recruiting office in Merced, Calif. But when she found that the
Air Force recruiter was out to lunch, she impulsively stopped at the
Navy office--and signed up.</TE>
<TE>   She attended naval officers' school in Newport, R.I., and was
commissioned in 1980. While assigned to a Navy personnel office in
Yokosuka, Japan, she arranged to ride on a support vessel where she
was allowed to stand watch, participate in a man-overboard exercise
and drive the ship. Later, she sailed out of Yokosuka on a visiting
frigate. It was a thrilling experience that led her to dream of one
day commanding a warship.</TE>
<TE>   After initially being turned down, she was admitted to the Surface
Warfare Officers School, which trained her to serve on an oiler,
tender or other auxiliary vessel. She served on four support ships
from 1983 to 1994, including commanding the Recovery, a rescue and
salvage ship.</TE>
<TE>   During this period she earned a master's degree in education from
Stanford University.</TE>
<TE>   When Congress opened warships to women in 1994, she paid her dues
for a few years, working in the Navy's personnel bureau in
Washington, and then helping to manage a destroyer squadron based in
San Diego.</TE>
<TE>   A week before Christmas in 1998, she was given command of the
Jarrett.</TE>
<TE>   "It's an understatement that I'm delighted," she said in a short
speech after taking charge of the combat ship.</TE>
<TE>   Paul Stillwell, a historian at the Naval Institute at Annapolis,
Md., said the importance of McGrath's promotion cannot be overstated.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a huge breakthrough, given the tradition-bound nature of
the Navy," he said by phone Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   Said Jean A. Ebbert, coauthor with Marie-Beth Hall of "Crossed
Currents, Navy Women in a Century of Change": "The command at sea of
a warship is the most meaningful thing that a naval officer can do.
It happened [to McGrath] because she was prepared."</TE>
<TE>   McGrath told an interviewer that the only special accommodation
made for her on the Jarrett was removing the spring-loaded, always-up
toilet seat in her cabin's head.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to searching for oil smugglers, she led the ship
during search and rescue operations for a downed Marine CH-46
helicopter and for Alaska Airlines Flight 261, which crashed into the
ocean off the Ventura County coast in January 2000, killing all 88
aboard. Her deployments took her to the Mediterranean and Caribbean,
the Western Pacific and the Persian Gulf.</TE>
<TE>   As commander, she was credited with breaking down traditional
barriers between enlisted men and officers. Soon after becoming
captain of the Jarrett, she hosted a mixed-rank barbecue in honor of
five new chief petty officers.</TE>
<TE>   When her tour as commander was up, she served at the Joint
Advanced Warfighting Unit in Alexandria, Va.</TE>
<TE>   Rear Adm. Harry Ulrich, director of surface warfare, called
McGrath "an accomplished surface warrior and leader" who embodied the
Navy's values of honor, courage and commitment.</TE>
<TE>   She was married to a Navy officer, Lt. Cmdr. Gregory Brandon.
Before she went to sea with the Jarrett, she and Brandon took time
off to start a family, adopting two Russian toddlers, Nicholas and
Clare, in 1999. Brandon, who retired in 1996, was their primary
caretaker while she was away.</TE>
<TE>   McGrath won many medals during her career, including the Legion of
Merit, four Meritorious Service Medals and three Navy Commendation
Medals.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to her husband and children, she is survived by three
sisters, two brothers and her parents, James and Martha McGrath of
Sequim, Wash.</TE>

<HD>Rising Above a Scandal</HD>
<DH>At a Dana Point church plagued by allegations of priestly
abuse, parishioners say their Catholicism has grown stronger.</DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In a year of scandal, few Catholic congregations have been tested as
severely as the 5,000 families of St. Edward Church in Dana Point.</LD>
<LD>   Their charismatic pastor was ousted after admitting several
affairs with women. Later, the church paid $1.2 million to settle
allegations that he impregnated a 16-year-old girl in the early 1980s
and paid for her abortion.</LD>
<LD>   There was more: A beloved senior priest was removed amid
allegations that he sexually abused a teenage boy two decades ago. A
former parish priest admitted having done the same. Still another was
accused of molestation.</LD>
<TE>   In the latest devastating disclosure from a buried past,
authorities last week arrested a former priest from St. Edward on
charges that, in the early 1970s, he sexually abused and impregnated
a teenage girl who sang in the church choir.</TE>
<TE>   Some feared this spiritual water torture would cause an exodus to
other parishes or even out of the Roman Catholic Church. But many in
the parish say they emerged from their trial of faith more committed
than ever. They stopped idolizing the men behind the altar, they say,
and refocused their adoration on the figure nailed to the cross.</TE>
<TE>   Donations to St. Edward have risen 6% in the past year. The
introductory class for prospective converts, held earlier this month,
was packed with more than 40 seekers, a record number. The ranks of
youth group leaders nearly doubled this year to 41.</TE>
<TE>   The wounded parish has survived and in some ways thrived, thanks
to a tight-knit group of congregants who stubbornly kept showing up
on Sundays no matter how they felt. They attended venting sessions
convened by diocesan officials and privately struggled to reconnect
to the roots of their faith. Many parishioners say their healing was
aided by an abundance of prayer and grace.</TE>
<TE>   "We were bleeding, and that wound is starting to cover over," said
Suzanne Russell, a 72-year-old grandmother from Dana Point who has
attended the church for 10 years. "But we'll never be the same."</TE>
<TE>   St. Edward sits on nine hilltop acres overlooking Dana Point
Harbor. Large windows behind the altar afford a 180-degree view of a
Pacific Ocean dotted with sails. Each Fourth of July, young families
picnic on the hilltop at dusk, listen to patriotic music and watch
fireworks.</TE>
<TE>   In 1995, Father John Lenihan became only the second head priest in
St. Edward's 34-year history. He was a charismatic Irishman, at ease
before crowds though awkward in small groups.</TE>
<TE>   In his first announcement to the congregation, he admitted that he
had had an inappropriate relationship with a young woman in the late
1970s. But, he said, that part of his life was behind him.</TE>
<TE>   During the next six years, St. Edward grew from 2,000 families to
almost 5,000, fueled by a building boom in south Orange County, a new
$6-million church building and Lenihan's infectious enthusiasm.</TE>
<TE>   The growth was so explosive--in membership, in school enrollment,
in ministries--that an $8-million fund-raising campaign was launched
in 1999 to double the school's size, buy several acres of adjacent
land and build a community center.</TE>
<TE>   Months before the $4.9-million school expansion was completed, the
congregation suffered the first of the shocks that would test its
faith.</TE>
<TE>   Three days after the Sept. 11 terrorists attacks, Los Angeles
Times columnist Steve Lopez wrote about an Orange County priest,
identified only as Father X, who admitted having molested a teenage
girl and having had at least four affairs over the years with women.
When church officials confronted him, Lenihan acknowledged that he
was the priest in question. He was fired by Bishop Tod D. Brown of
the Diocese of Orange.</TE>
<TE>   "That initial stab was the worst," said Donna Couch, director of
the convert program at the church for the past 18 years. "When you
work with these [priests], you always become their cheerleaders. The
dose of reality was difficult."</TE>
<TE>   The immediate reaction to the news divided the congregation. One
group wanted to circulate petitions calling for Brown to keep Lenihan
at St. Edward. The priest, they said, had been an excellent pastor
and should be forgiven for his mistakes. Another group threatened a
petition drive of its own, to prevent Lenihan from returning.</TE>
<TE>   "It was painful and embarrassing and strange and strained," said
Diane Wetherbee, a member of the church for eight years.</TE>
<TE>   Some parishioners, who were taught to hold priests in godlike awe,
had a particularly difficult time with the news.</TE>
<TE>   "Priests were put on such a high pedestal," said Margie Bushaw, a
48-year-old Laguna Niguel resident. "You just looked at them
differently. I think that might have been my biggest problem."</TE>
<TE>   Diocesan officials improvised a plan to help the congregation
cope. Brown installed Father Steve Sallot, the respected 48-year-old
rector of Mater Dei High School, as interim pastor. For the next nine
months, Sallot spent Saturdays, Sundays and Mondays at the church.
The rest of the week, while at the high school, he stayed in touch by
cell phone with the two newly ordained priests who handled daily
operations at St. Edward.</TE>
<TE>   "None of us had been through something like this before," Sallot
said. "We came to realize that it needed to be handled like a crisis
in the family, when people went through the whole grieving process."</TE>
<TE>   A few weeks after the Lenihan news broke, diocesan officials met
with about 400 congregants one evening in the parish hall. The
audience's questions--ranging from why the bishop's response to
Lenihan's misconduct was so harsh to how the Catholic Church as a
whole could better protect children--were written on a large
dry-erase board and grouped by themes.</TE>
<TE>   The officials talked about the steps the church was taking in
response to the scandal, including a "zero-tolerance" policy on
sexual misconduct by priests, no matter how long ago it had occurred.
But the diocesan officials declined to answer questions about
Lenihan's behavior, saying it was a personnel matter and therefore
confidential.</TE>
<TE>   "Some people went away relieved. Some people went away thinking,
'Who's going to support our priest?' " said Maria Schinderle, the
diocesan director of human resources and a St. Edward parishioner for
22 years. "I felt most people thought, 'OK, we asked questions and
they answered us. We might not have liked all the answers, but we got
them.' "</TE>
<TE>   A Chance to Vent</TE>
<TE>   An evening "listening" session at the parish elementary school,
moderated by a nun trained as a counselor, let congregants vent their
feelings about the scandal. A mountain retreat for teens also helped
the healing process.</TE>
<TE>   "We just kept putting one foot in front of the other," said
Russell, who met with five other women from St. Edward every few
weeks. The group studied Scripture, prayed and discussed Catholic
issues around a lighted candle in a parishioner's living room in Dana
Point.</TE>
<TE>   "It just was a time of feeling very fragmented and trying to get
body and soul back together," Russell said.</TE>
<TE>   Prayers were added at each church service for victims of sexual
abuse and for priests.</TE>
<TE>   When a third-grader at the 675-student St. Edward School suffered
a brain aneurysm soon after Lenihan was fired, parents, staff and
parishioners rallied around the boy. The divisions within the
congregations suddenly seemed unimportant. The child recovered and
has returned to school.</TE>
<TE>   "I call it the backhand of grace," said Sallot. "It helped people
draw together for more profound and spiritual reasons and to stop
gossiping in the church parking lot."</TE>
<TE>   But then, new allegations of sexual abuse surfaced with sickening
frequency.</TE>
<TE>   In December, a woman from Lenihan's former parish, St. Norbert
Church in Orange, filed suit, contending that he had impregnated her
when she was 16 and paid for her abortion in 1982. The Diocese of
Orange and the Archdiocese of Los Angeles paid $1.2 million to settle
the claim, though Lenihan did not admit the allegations. The Orange
County Sheriff's Department is conducting a criminal investigation.</TE>
<TE>   In March, Father Michael Pecharich, a well-liked former priest at
St. Edward who was working in a neighboring parish, resigned under
the zero-tolerance policy, because he had previously admitted
molesting an adolescent boy 19 years ago.</TE>
<TE>   The following month, Father Denis Lyons, a senior priest at St.
Edward, was put on administrative leave just two months short of his
retirement after allegations surfaced that he had molested a boy two
decades ago. He had previously admitted "inappropriate behavior" with
two men at another parish.</TE>
<TE>   In May, the congregation learned disturbing news about yet another
priest who had once spoken from their pulpit and heard their
confessions. A man filed suit claiming that Father Siegfried Widera
had molested him at a Yorba Linda parish in 1985.</TE>
<TE>   The suit contended that church officials in the 1970s allowed
Widera to work in Orange County parishes, including St. Edward, even
though they knew he had been involved in an earlier molestation case
in Milwaukee. A few weeks after the suit was filed, Milwaukee
authorities charged Widera with sexually abusing three minors while
he was a priest there in the 1970s. Widera disappeared and is
considered a fugitive.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, Gerald Plesetz was jailed last Tuesday on charges that he
had sexually abused a choir girl for two years beginning in 1972,
when she was 14 and he was a priest at St. Edward.</TE>
<TE>   Plesetz was arrested after allegedly confessing to an undercover
sheriff's deputy posing as the daughter born to the teenage
parishioner. The daughter, now 27, was put up for adoption as an
infant.</TE>
<TE>   Some parishioners took refuge in gallows humor as the allegations
stacked up, wondering aloud whether a crop-duster should spray holy
water over the church.</TE>
<TE>   Questioning Their Faith</TE>
<TE>   Many experienced a crisis of faith.</TE>
<TE>   Bushaw converted to Catholicism 24 years ago and had rarely missed
Sunday Mass, even while on vacation. But her attendance in the past
year has been sporadic, and she has flirted with returning to her
Protestant roots.</TE>
<TE>   "It's been a struggle," she said. "Nothing's come real easy. Some
days I'm hanging by a thread."</TE>
<TE>   But like so many of the faithful at St. Edward, she decided to
stay. In contrast to some Protestant worshipers--especially those in
nondenominational mega-churches--Catholics tend to feel loyalty to
the church rather than its leaders.</TE>
<TE>   The focus of Catholicism is the sacraments--such as confession and
Holy Communion--rather than dynamic personalities in the pulpit.</TE>
<TE>   Bushaw says she feels called to remain a Catholic and fight for
reform.</TE>
<TE>   "If people leave, I'm afraid that change won't take place," she
said.</TE>
<TE>   Joan Bejarano, a St. Edward lay leader who reads the Scripture
selection at Sunday Mass, said the relentless drumbeat of bad news
forced her to retreat to a neighboring parish for a short time this
summer.</TE>
<TE>   "I wanted a breath of fresh air," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Rummy Rodriguez, a 20-year-old college student from Dana Point,
has been attending Mass at St. Edward for the past four years.</TE>
<TE>   The disclosures, however, made Rodriguez think twice about going
to confession. He didn't know whether he could trust the new priests.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought, 'What's the point?' Maybe I shouldn't be confessing to
these people," Rodriguez said. "But I don't have to confess to a
priest. I can just get on my knees and pray to God."</TE>
<TE>   He said he wonders sometimes whether any other priests at St.
Edward, past or present, "did something that hasn't come out yet.</TE>
<TE>   "But I can't do anything about it, so I don't let it bother me,"
he said. "Like I said, I don't come here for a priest. I come here
for God."</TE>
<TE>   Sallot, a priest for 23 years, said the crisis has changed many of
his spiritual disciplines. He's creating a small chapel in the
rectory to accommodate an increased prayer life among the clergy, and
redoubling efforts to spend time with his fellow priests at dinner or
on nights out. "We can get very isolated, since we basically work
alone," Sallot said.</TE>
<TE>   Shawn Wehan, the parish's 27-year-old youth minister, said: "We
now can focus on true spirituality and relationship with God, and not
a bunch of hocus-pocus."</TE>
<TE>   The soul-searching and intensified prayer have given the parish an
added vitality, said Couch.</TE>
<TE>   "I would say before all this happened, a small percentage of the
people in the pews knew why they are Catholic," she said. "Now
everyone knows."</TE>

<LD>Luther Henderson, 82, leader of an investment group that bought Pier
1 Imports in 1966 and turned the company into a national retailer,
died Saturday in Fort Worth of injuries sustained in a traffic
accident two weeks earlier.</LD>
<LD>   Henderson served as Pier 1's chairman and president and
founder-chairman from 1966 to 1983, and its chairman from 1983 to
1985. He served as a director and founder-chairman from 1985 until
1993.</LD>
<LD>   Born in Fort Worth in 1920, he earned a bachelor's degree at Texas

<HD>Roller Coaster's Thrill Is Stuff of Romance</HD>
<DH>Beach boardwalk's old-fashioned, wooden Giant Dipper can
still work its magic on receptive couples.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID FERRELL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Nights at the beach, on a speeding roller coaster, inspire many
sensations.</LD>
<LD>   One is romance.</LD>
<LD>   Even as a youngster, Nancy Orrock Shutt felt the magic while
riding the huge white roller coaster, the Giant Dipper, on the Santa
Cruz Beach Boardwalk. Hearing the couples screaming, seeing the
flashing lights and neon of the amusement park below, created thrills
she would never outgrow.</LD>
<TE>   "It was always my dream to have a boyfriend with me," remembered
Shutt, now 42, who exceeded the fantasy by a long shot 10 years ago,
while riding the coaster with her beau, Robert Shutt. He turned to
her as they began ascending the enormous first crest and popped the
question--still the best moment among great moments too numerous to
count. There's no telling how many times they had ridden the Dipper
leading up to that instant, or how many times they have ridden it
since.</TE>
<TE>   "Hundreds of times--thousands of times," said Robert Shutt, a
Sunnyvale banker, after they had piled off it again, laughing, to
celebrate his 42nd birthday.</TE>
<TE>   Callie Gray, who's been riding the Giant Dipper for more than 40
years, understands completely. Romance? Her parents dated on the
landmark 1924 roller coaster before World War II. She and her first
husband courted there, later bringing their two children. She and her
second husband, Brad, also made regular drives down the coast to
spend afternoons and evenings riding the Dipper--and still do.</TE>
<TE>   "We love roller coasters," said Gray, 55, an interior designer who
lives in Campbell, 15 minutes from Santa Cruz. "We've actually
thought about traveling the United States and riding all the big
coasters." They're off to a good start, she added, having tried 50 or
so as far east as Hershey, Pa.</TE>
<TE>   So far, Gray said, the Dipper is her favorite, partly for the feel
you get on an old wooden coaster--noises and vibrations missing from
slick modern rides. "I'm a purist," she said. "The wooden ones are
the best."</TE>
<TE>   The Giant Dipper, built for $50,000, using about 30 tons of steel
and iron and well over a quarter-million feet of lumber, is the
oldest operating roller coaster on the West Coast, said Jan
Bollwinkel-Smith, a boardwalk spokeswoman. The half-mile track,
rimmed with flashing white lights, rises as high as 70 feet and
propels the low-slung trains up to 55 mph.</TE>
<TE>   That pales in comparison to today's marvels. Monstrosities such as
the Texas Tornado in Houston and the Millennium Force in Sandusky,
Ohio, are said to be pushing the limits of human tolerance.
Millennium Force rises more than 300 feet and reaches 92 mph, making
it a mecca for hard-core coaster fans.</TE>
<TE>   Still, the Giant Dipper provides a formidable adrenaline rush.
After the lap bar presses down, the train immediately bolts forward,
dipping into a tunnel and twisting left and right in the dark. The
blackness lasts a long time before you emerge and begin the long
first climb, looking out over the beach and pier.</TE>
<TE>   Flying down the first dip, you're suddenly forced back in the
seat, driven downward as the train shoots skyward again. There are
places, in the middle and lower levels, where it appears the cars are
rushing straight toward overhanging beams. At the last second the
cars dip again, twisting into new turns.</TE>
<TE>   Roller coasters trigger feelings of helplessness and
danger--hurtling out of control, locked in, not knowing what lies
next. The sensory bombardment raises your pulse, puts you face to
face with death and, many enthusiasts say, is more satisfying on a
wooden coaster. The hushed clatter of the tracks is one of those
sounds that defines childhood, like the sprocket noise of a
derailleur bicycle.</TE>
<TE>   From the street, the Giant Dipper appears impossibly long and
intricate, as if built of thousands of painted Popsicle sticks. It is
a National Historic Landmark in an amusement zone that is itself a
tale of survival.</TE>
<TE>   The boardwalk dates to 1907, when the Cocoanut Grove ballroom and
conference center opened. That complex still exists in a park that
now contains more than 30 amusement rides.</TE>
<TE>   The boardwalk is a protected state landmark that retains a
small-town feel despite the soaring real estate prices that doomed
two of the other great beachside fun zones: Santa Monica's Pacific
Ocean Park, shuttered in the 1960s, and Long Beach's Pike, which lost
its own legendary roller coaster, the Cyclone Racer, about the same
time. The Pike was dead by the mid-1970s.</TE>
<TE>   The Giant Dipper this year celebrated its 50 millionth rider, a
milestone that's something of a misnomer, considering how many people
have ridden it more than once.</TE>
<TE>   Look at Art Warner, 67, of Santa Cruz: He's been climbing aboard
since before there were seat restraints--at least 100 times. Susan
Grinstead of Sacramento? Same thing, plus she's brought her son,
Zachary, 12, for 10 or more trips.</TE>
<TE>   Miles Jolly, barely 20, of Sacramento already puts himself over
the century mark. He's one of those who like to see how many times he
can ride in a row. Mark Vega is another.</TE>
<TE>   "We rode it 16 times" in one day, said Vega, 48, of Orangeville,
whose large family broke their old record of 13 straight trips.</TE>
<TE>   The Shutts ride over and over every New Year's, starting out the
year right.</TE>
<TE>   "It's an icon of the West Coast," Robert Shutt said, citing one
reason he proposed on the Dipper. Another is the state of mind you
see people in after that final drop. "When you get off that thing,
everybody has a smile."</TE>

osteoarthritis for several years and recently was having trouble
walking. He was in such pain this week that it was decided to
euthanize him.</LD>
<LD>   Taj was born at the Henry Doorly Zoo in Omaha in 1984 and was
brought to Washington two years later. He never had any offspring.</LD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Trying to avoid the death penalty, serial killer Robert Lee Yates Jr.
spoke to a Pierce County Superior Court jury and apologized for the
"morass of evil" that was his life.</LD>
<LD>   "I prepared this so I might leave nothing within my heart unsaid
that needs to be said to all my victims' families and my family and
people in the communities I've terrorized," said Yates, who has
admitted killing 15 people since 1975.</LD>
<LD>   "I'm sorry beyond what words can express," Yates said.</LD>
<TE>   The jury convicted Yates, 50, last month of aggravated
first-degree murder for the slayings of Melinda Mercer, 24, in 1997
and Connie LaFontaine Ellis, 35, in 1998. Yates admitted killing both
women.</TE>
<TE>   Yates has already been sentenced to 408 years in prison as part of
a 2000 plea agreement in Spokane County. Pierce County prosecutors
refused to go along with that deal and brought Yates to trial for
aggravated first-degree murder, the only crime to carry the death
penalty in Washington state.</TE>
<TE>   Now, the jury must decide whether to put him to death.</TE>

But he was among Minnesotans who didn't vote in the primary.</LD>
<LD>   The governor spent much of primary day in meetings with

<LD>   A week after the primary, Ventura accepted an award from Kids

<LD>A recall of contaminated ground beef that has been linked to possible
E. coli bacteria illnesses among 40 people in three Midwestern states
is being expanded to 2.3 million pounds of meat sold nationwide, the
Agriculture Department said.</LD>
<LD>   The Wisconsin-based meatpacker, Emmpak Foods Inc., recalled
416,000 pounds of ground beef in September in Illinois, Wisconsin and
Minnesota, but it expanded the recall late Wednesday. The beef was
sold in grocery stores, hotels, restaurants and other food
institutions nationwide.</LD>
<LD>   The recall was initiated after food safety inspectors reviewed
plant practices and company records at Emmpak, which does business as
Peck Meats.</LD>

<HD>Liberal Gephardt Sides With Bush on Iraq War Resolution</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NICK ANDERSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>By winning the blessing of the liberal House Democratic leader,
President Bush scored a coup Wednesday in his drive for a strong show
of bipartisan support for a war resolution to confront Saddam
Hussein.</LD>
<LD>   The development was all the more significant because House
Minority Leader Richard A. Gephardt (D-Mo.) was one of many in his
party who opposed the 1991 Persian Gulf War resolution.</LD>
<LD>   With his appearance in the Rose Garden, endorsing the resolution
alongside the president and Republican congressional leaders,
Gephardt broke definitively from many in the liberal base of his
party who remain unpersuaded of the need for a new Gulf War. He also
won effusive praise from the conservative Republicans who usually
denounce him as a left-wing zealot.</LD>
<TE>   Yet Gephardt's conversion from dove to hawk was not sudden. As
early as June, he had advocated the use of military force, if
necessary, to oust the Iraqi president.</TE>
<TE>   In a brief interview Wednesday, the minority leader said the Sept.
11 terrorist attacks had jolted his world view. "In the end, 9/11
changed everything," he said. "Our highest responsibility is to do
everything we can to prevent further acts of terrorism in the United
States, especially with weapons of mass destruction."</TE>
<TE>   Politics, he insisted, was not a factor in his decision.</TE>
<TE>   Inevitably, however, Gephardt's vote on the Iraq resolution,
expected to come next week to the House floor, will be a factor if he
seeks the Democratic presidential nomination in 2004.</TE>
<TE>   Some potential rivals, such as Sens. Joseph I. Lieberman of
Connecticut and John Edwards of North Carolina, also have aligned
themselves with Bush on Iraq. Others have been skeptical and
noncommittal (Sen. John F. Kerry of Massachusetts) or critical
(former Vice President Al Gore and Vermont Gov. Howard Dean).</TE>
<TE>   Gephardt's move, although it had been telegraphed in recent days,
drew sharp reactions from Democrats on both sides of the Capitol.</TE>
<TE>   Some previously skeptical of the administration's war plans were
won over, saying the resolution that Bush first proposed had been
altered significantly through Gephardt's participation in the
negotiations.</TE>
<TE>   These Democrats pointed to language in the revised resolution that
supports efforts to end the crisis diplomatically, defines the scope
of the authorization of use of military force and requires the
president to report to Congress on diplomatic efforts, the war on
terrorism, any military operations in Iraq and plans for
reconstruction and peacekeeping.</TE>
<TE>   Much of the revised language attempted to address criticism of the
original resolution by senior Democrats, including Reps. Ike Skelton
of Missouri, John M. Spratt Jr. of South Carolina and John P. Murtha
of Pennsylvania--leaders on defense matters whose support would be
crucial.</TE>
<TE>   Some critics of the administration, however, fumed at Wednesday's
developments. And some Senate Democrats who were seeking to modify
the proposal even further, such as Majority Leader Tom Daschle of
South Dakota, were left in the lurch.</TE>
<TE>   Gephardt said he could not predict how many in his party would
vote for the measure. On such "life and death" decisions, he said,
all members had to make up their own minds. "I respect what everybody
decides," he said. "That's the way we have to do this."</TE>
<TE>   And he acknowledged uncertainty himself. "We all see through the
glass darkly," he said. "None of us knows the truth. None of us knows
how this is going to come out."</TE>
<TE>   Of the 208 House Democrats, a majority will support the resolution
when it comes to a vote, aides to the leadership believe. If that
occurs, it would mark a shift for the party.</TE>
<TE>   In January 1991, 86 House Democrats voted for the Gulf War
resolution and 179--including Gephardt and other party leaders--voted
against it. Of those Democrats who are still in the House, 50 opposed
the Gulf War and 23 supported it.</TE>
<TE>   As Congress prepares for another momentous war debate, the
fissures in a party that had in years past divided on military
conflicts in Vietnam, Central America and the Persian Gulf were
reappearing Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   For example, Reps. David E. Bonior (D-Mich.) and Jim McDermott
(D-Wash.), who went to Baghdad last weekend to lobby for a peaceful
end to the conflict, reiterated their view that a war resolution is
premature.</TE>
<TE>   Bonior, a former House minority whip, called the move toward war
"a grave, grave mistake" that would undermine the ongoing U.S. battle
against terrorist groups such as Al Qaeda.</TE>
<TE>   Rep. Anna G. Eshoo (D-Atherton), another administration critic,
said she feared that Gephardt's alliance with Bush would diminish the
effect of next week's floor debate. "I would have much preferred to
have debated in eloquent, passionate voices what was wrong with the
president's resolution," Eshoo said. "We can still speak, and we're
going to. But [Gephardt's decision] changes the color" of the debate.</TE>
<TE>   Rep. Adam B. Schiff (D-Burbank), however, said he was "strongly
inclined" to support the resolution, and he applauded the minority
leader. "He's done a superb job under difficult circumstances,"
Schiff said. "Our caucus is very deeply split. That's a challenge to
represent as a leader."</TE>

<HD>Bush's Iraq Stance Hints at a Bid to Settle Old Score</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>EDWIN CHEN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>As President Bush seeks to mount an anti-Iraq coalition, his rhetoric
against Iraqi President Saddam Hussein suggests that his desire for a
"regime change" in Baghdad includes a strong dose of personal enmity.</LD>
<LD>   And that would not be surprising, given Bush has shown that
personal considerations can influence his words and deeds, whether
it's rewarding friends or punishing foes.</LD>
<LD>   With his recent condemnations of Hussein as not only a dictator
who poses "a grave and gathering danger" to the world but also
someone who tried to assassinate Bush's father, the president has
added to the perception that he is out to settle an old score.</LD>
<TE>   "After all, this is a guy that tried to kill my dad at one time,"
Bush told an audience in Houston last week. He also referred to the
1993 Iraqi assassination attempt during his Sept. 12 address to the
U.N. General Assembly. And the elder Bush declared in a recent CNN
interview: "I hate Saddam Hussein."</TE>
<TE>   White House aides dismiss talk of a Bush family grudge. "Look,
obviously, one doesn't want to appear to personalize this," one
senior administration official said.</TE>
<TE>   But the president's single-mindedness has fueled the suspicion
that his push to oust Hussein is motivated, if only in part, by an
urge to finish a job that his father started as president with the
Persian Gulf War in 1991.</TE>
<TE>   "You can see how some people perceive it as revenge. On the other
hand, [administration officials] will never admit it," said Bruce
Buchanan, a University of Texas presidential historian. "But it
probably figures in there as some small, private pleasure."</TE>
<TE>   Some who have crossed Bush over the years believe that he not only
can nurse grudges, but also deliver paybacks--a trait that German
Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder may be discovering.</TE>
<TE>   Waging a fiercely anti-U.S. campaign helped Schroeder narrowly win
a reelection bid last month. In addition, his justice minister
allegedly said that Bush was talking of war to distract Americans
from a weak economy in much the same way Adolf Hitler did. Even
though she later resigned, the incidents angered Bush, a man who
prizes loyalty.</TE>
<TE>   Also, Bush's decision this year to call for Yasser Arafat's ouster
is widely viewed as having been partially motivated by what the
president considered personal betrayals by the Palestinian leader,
such as lying about arms shipments from Iran.</TE>
<TE>   "He works very hard to establish a rapport and find a common
interest. But he also holds people to a very high standard. If
they're not supportive, he will not be restrained in his criticism of
them," said Craig Fuller, a Washington lobbyist who served as chief
of staff when Bush's father was vice president in the Reagan
administration. Among those who have encountered Bush's hard-nosed
approach are Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.)--who contested Bush for the
GOP presidential nomination in 2000 and who on many issues remains a
thorn in his side--and those who worked in McCain's campaign.</TE>
<TE>   The Bush White House "went out of its way to make sure McCain
people had a hard time finding work in the administration or
elsewhere in Republican politics," said a senior GOP congressional
staffer. McCain eventually brought up the matter privately with Bush
but to no avail.</TE>
<TE>   McCain was subjected to a high-profile White House snub after the
passage this year of the campaign finance reform bill he long had
championed.</TE>
<TE>   Given that most Republicans and Bush vehemently opposed the
measure's key provisions, a grand bill-signing ceremony was never
expected. McCain "knew there wouldn't be one," said Mark Salter, the
senator's chief of staff.</TE>
<TE>   But McCain didn't even rate advance notice, as Bush signed the
measure without fanfare early one morning and then left town. The job
of informing McCain fell to a young staffer in the office of Nicholas
E. Calio, the White House legislative director. McCain was home in
Arizona sound asleep when the call came--at 6 a.m.</TE>
<TE>   Bush never has been shy about being blunt.</TE>
<TE>   In the mid-1980s, as his father--then vice president under Ronald
Reagan--was contemplating a presidential bid, the younger Bush
confronted the late Lee Atwater, a flamboyant, take-no-prisoners
Republican strategist. Bush told him that he intended to monitor
Atwater's commitment and loyalty to his father.</TE>
<TE>   In late 1987, after Newsweek published a negative cover story on
his father, titled "Fighting the Wimp Factor," Bush told a senior
magazine staffer: "Newsweek's been cut off. You're out of business."</TE>
<TE>   Last month, the White House canceled an interview that First Lady
Laura Bush was to give to U.S. News &amp; World Report after the
newsweekly reported on the Secret Service protection for the first
couple's twin daughters.</TE>
<TE>   Many longtime Bush watchers believe that Bush in 1994 challenged
incumbent Texas Gov. Ann Richards, a Democrat, in large part because
of her oft-quoted quip in a speech at the 1988 National Democratic
Convention that his father had been "born with a silver foot in his
mouth."</TE>
<TE>   As Richards telephoned to concede on election night, "a massive
smile" spread across Bush's face, according to Bill Minutaglio,
author of "First Son," a 1999 biography of Bush.</TE>
<TE>   In the recent rupture with Schroeder, Bush's anger was quickly
evident--the president departed from protocol by not calling to
congratulate the chancellor.</TE>
<TE>   Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld, in Warsaw for a North
Atlantic Treaty Organization conference shortly afterward, snubbed
his German counterpart. At the White House, National Security Advisor
Condoleezza Rice declared that Schroeder had "poisoned" the
atmosphere between Washington and Berlin.</TE>
<TE>   Few doubt that the U.S.-German relationship, given its strategic
importance, will right itself. But many German officials believe that
some Bush payback is inevitable--a fear that the White House has not
sought to allay.</TE>
<TE>   "Nobody should be under any illusions or mistakes that, now that
the election is over, that everything goes back to the way it was,"
said White House Press Secretary Ari Fleischer.</TE>
<TE>   "Some people in Texas say: 'Forgive and remember,' " said Garnet
Coleman, a Democratic Texas state lawmaker who observed, close up,
Bush's style when he was governor. "We know the history of the Bush
family: In a competitive world, you may lose this battle, but the
issue is whether you win the war."</TE>

<HD>Senators Take Some Time Out to Pay Tribute to Jesse Helms</HD>
<DH>Retirement: A hero to many conservatives for his
anti-communism, the 'true gentleman of the Old South' is finishing
his fifth term.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The Senate paid tribute Wednesday to retiring Sen. Jesse Helms of
North Carolina, an icon of conservatism and an uncompromising foe of
communism who, colleagues said, abided by a Southern courtliness of a
bygone era.</LD>
<LD>   Democratic Sen. Robert C. Byrd of West Virginia, the 84-year-old
Senate president pro tempore, called Helms, 80, "a true gentleman of
the Old South" who stuck to his beliefs and demonstrated the power a
single senator can wield.</LD>
<LD>   "He was not a man to be intimidated," Byrd said as Helms' wife,
Dorothy, and other friends and family looked on from the gallery. "He
took a stand. He was willing to take a stand alone, without a
tremor."</LD>
<TE>   Helms, who is serving the last of his five terms, was the second
retiring senator from the Carolinas in as many weeks to be recognized
for his long service. Senators last week turned their attention to
99-year-old Strom Thurmond (R-S.C.), who was first elected in 1954.</TE>
<TE>   Helms is a hero to many conservatives for his ardent opposition to
communism, an agenda he advanced from senior positions on the Senate
Foreign Relations Committee. He battled with the United Nations over
U.S. dues and was in the conservative vanguard of social issues such
as school busing, pornography in art, flag-burning and homosexuality
in the Boy Scouts.</TE>
<TE>   "His willingness to stand up and say what he felt was right is the
essence of what it takes," said Sen. Judd Gregg (R-N.H.).</TE>
<TE>   Added GOP Sen. Mitch McConnell of Kentucky: "There is no question
that you have made an enormous difference."</TE>
<TE>   On Capitol Hill, Helms won the nickname "Sen. No" for his relish
in blocking nominations and legislation from reaching the Senate
floor. True to form, Helms objected Wednesday to a Foreign Relations
Committee meeting on Iraq that had been scheduled at the same time as
his tribute.</TE>
<TE>   Helms' Democratic colleague from North Carolina, Sen. John
Edwards, called Helms a "relentless advocate" for the state's people
and interests, including tobacco growers whose products he once gave
away at his Senate offices.</TE>
<TE>   "You can't hardly move in North Carolina without finding people
that Sen. Helms has touched," Edwards said.</TE>
<TE>   Senators of both parties, including liberal Democrats who disagree
with Helms on almost every issue, said that Helms maintained a gentle
demeanor even toward opponents and was particularly kind to the
elevator operators, pages and other workers who keep the Capitol
operating.</TE>
<TE>   "One of the ways you judge a person is just to watch the way they
treat people," said Sen. Paul Wellstone (D-Minn.). "I don't think
there's anybody in the Senate who treats them with more grace."</TE>
<TE>   Helms sat at his desk during the tribute, waving a salute and
mouthing the words "thank you" when a speaker finished. He has been
slowed by health problems in recent years, including heart surgery
this year that caused him to miss much of the Senate's business.</TE>
<TE>   But his sense of humor was clearly intact. Referring to his
frequent jousts with newspaper editorial writers and pundits, Helms
said of the speeches: "I've been sitting here wondering who on Earth
this Helms guy is."</TE>
<TE>   Then he quickly added: "I am grateful."</TE>

<HD>Bush Gets Strong Backing on Iraq</HD>
<DH>Congress: Bipartisan accord by lawmakers puts pressure on
Democratic holdouts. Daschle, others refuse to back tough compromise.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JANET HOOK</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>President Bush on Wednesday reached agreement with a bipartisan
phalanx of congressional leaders on a tough resolution authorizing
the use of force against Iraq, a major breakthrough in his effort to
unify lawmakers behind his challenge to Iraqi President Saddam
Hussein.</LD>
<LD>   The agreement fell short of Bush's hopes that top U.S. officials
would, as he has put it, "speak with one voice" on Iraq. Senate
Majority Leader Tom Daschle (D-S.D.) and some other key Senate
Democrats refused to endorse the compromise and continued to push for
more restrictions on Bush's latitude to wage war.</LD>
<LD>   But the breadth of support behind the compromise--those embracing
it included House Minority Leader Richard A. Gephardt (D-Mo.) and
Sen. Joseph I. Lieberman (D-Conn.), as well as GOP leaders--puts
enormous pressure on Democratic holdouts to rally behind the
president.</LD>
<TE>   "The statement of support from the Congress will show to friend
and enemy alike the resolve of the United States," Bush said as he
unveiled the compromise at a Rose Garden ceremony, flanked by
Democratic and Republican supporters.</TE>
<TE>   Although many in Congress hope Bush will not exercise the military
option Congress is expected to authorize, he said it may become
inevitable if Hussein does not disarm. "If he persists in his
defiance, the use of force may become unavoidable," Bush said.</TE>
<TE>   The resolution, as reworked, would give Bush the essential
elements of his initial request: the authority to wage a unilateral,
preemptive war against Iraq, regardless whether the United Nations
gives him the go-ahead.</TE>
<TE>   "The resolution does not tie the president's hands," said House
Speaker J. Dennis Hastert (R-Ill.). "It supports the president's
effort to work with the United Nations, but it doesn't require him to
seek U.N. approval first."</TE>
<TE>   But Bush did make some concessions to congressional critics by
agreeing to certify to Congress that any military action came only
after he had exhausted diplomatic options, and that an attack on Iraq
would not set back ongoing efforts to combat terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   The agreement clears the way for a broad bipartisan vote next week
in the House in support of Bush's initiative. The House International
Relations Committee began debate on the compromise Wednesday; the
session was briefly interrupted by antiwar protesters crying, "No war
in Iraq!"</TE>
<TE>   The panel was expected to vote today to send the bill to the full
House for what is likely to be two or three days of debate.</TE>
<TE>   The debate likely will be more divisive in the Senate, which was
supposed to take up the issue Wednesday but postponed debate at least
until today.</TE>
<TE>   The Senate debate is expected to focus on two alternatives to the
compromise announced at the White House. One, by Sens. Joseph R.
Biden Jr. (D-Del.) and Richard G. Lugar (R-Ind.), would authorize the
use of force only to disarm Hussein, not depose him, as Bush has
sought. A more dovish alternative by Sen. Carl Levin (D-Mich.) would
authorize U.S. military action only in conjunction with U.N.
approval.</TE>
<TE>   But even Biden said the president was likely to get his way.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm a realist," said Biden. "The president is going to be saying:
'Are you with me or against me?' That's a hard call."</TE>
<TE>   Sen. John W. Warner (R-Va.), who backed the compromise, told Bush
at the ceremony that whatever debate Congress may have about
alternatives, the president's proposal would be approved by margins
wider than given the resolution that authorized military action
against Iraq in 1991, when his father was president.</TE>
<TE>   The Senate adopted that resolution, 52 to 47; the House vote was
250 to 183.</TE>
<TE>   "Mr. President, we delivered for your father; we will deliver for
you," Warner said.</TE>
<TE>   The compromise resolution authorizes Bush to use force "as he
determines to be necessary and appropriate in order to defend the
national security of the U.S. against the continuing threat posed by
Iraq," and to enforce U.N. resolutions regarding Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   That narrows the focus to Iraq--not the region, as had been the
case in Bush's original proposal.</TE>
<TE>   In other concessions to congressional critics, the resolution
requires Bush to report to Congress every 60 days on the status of
the face-off with Iraq. And it requires Bush to tell Congress--no
later than 48 hours after he uses military force--that he did so only
after determining that further diplomatic efforts would be fruitless
and that the attack is "consistent" with the U.S. anti-terrorism
campaign.</TE>
<TE>   Those changes were enough to win the embrace of Gephardt, who for
months has urged a hawkish posture toward Iraq. Gephardt's
endorsement gave the compromise powerful momentum that left Daschle
and other Democratic skeptics increasingly isolated.</TE>
<TE>   Gephardt has been prominently mentioned as a prospective
Democratic presidential candidate in 2004, and joining him at the
ceremony were two others on that list--Lieberman and Sen. John
Edwards (D-N.C.).</TE>
<TE>   Daschle, meanwhile, kept a low profile through the day. He put out
a statement saying the resolution's new provisions "represent
improvements" over Bush's original proposal.</TE>
<TE>   But Daschle added, "I continue to believe that the final
resolution should include greater emphasis on eliminating Iraq's
weapons of mass destruction," as well as a stronger statement about
Bush's plans for a post-Hussein Iraq and more assurances that an
attack on the Baghdad regime would not undermine the war on
terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   Senate Minority Leader Trent Lott (R-Miss.) derided Daschle and
other Democrats for isolating themselves in their opposition to
giving Bush the power he needs. "I trust this president and I believe
the American people do," said Lott. "Only in the Senate Democratic
caucus do you find that kind of reservation."</TE>
<TE>   Some Democrats who had expressed qualms about Bush's Iraq policy
appeared to be giving ground. "Unfortunately, this has moved way
beyond our ability to put the brakes on it," said Rep. Ellen O.
Tauscher (D-Alamo). She had been urging congressional leaders to
delay a vote on the resolution until after the November elections,
but dropped her effort Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   Tauscher said she still had many questions about the rationale for
and details of Bush's plans in Iraq, but added that she was leaning
toward supporting the compromise resolution.</TE>
<TE>   The compromise also won the support of Rep. Jane Harman
(D-Venice). The new provisions, she said, address "many of my
constituents' concerns, while also allowing us to address the clear
and present threat posed by Saddam Hussein."</TE>
<TE>   House Democratic leadership aides said they believed more than
half of the chamber's 208 Democrats would support the compromise
resolution.</TE>
<TE>   About 40 antiwar Democrats have made clear that they will oppose
the resolution. Among them is Rep. Dennis J. Kucinich (D-Ohio), who
said Wednesday, "I remain strongly opposed to any military action by
the U.S. absent an immediate threat."</TE>
<TE>   The key question remained how many Senate Democrats will be
brought on board by the compromise.</TE>
<TE>   It did not persuade Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), who has been
supporting the Biden-Lugar alternative and does not think that the
compromise goes far enough to address her interest in working more
through the U.N., said spokesman Howard Gantman.</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.) declined comment, but she has been
working with Levin on the alternative--to authorize the use of force
only in conjunction with the U.N.</TE>
<TE>   Lugar called the compromise resolution a "substantial improvement"
over Bush's original proposal. Lugar also said he was inclined to
work with the administration to further modify it, rather than push
for the alternative he authored with Biden.</TE>
<TE>   But Biden continued to argue for the alternative. He said he
believed there were as many as 25 Senate Republicans who would
support it in the absence of presidential pressure.</TE>
<TE>   But he acknowledged, "At the end of the day, you're not going to
have that many Republicans" willing to stray from the White House's
position.</TE>

<HD>Residents Along Gulf Coast Flee Ahead of Lili</HD>
<DH>Weather: The Category 4 storm's winds were clocked at 145
mph. It's shaping up to be one of the worst hurricanes the region has
seen in years.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARK FINEMAN and MEGAN K. STACK</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>LAFAYETTE, La.</DL>
<LD>As one of the worst hurricanes this region has seen in years bore
down on the Louisiana coast Wednesday night, hundreds of thousands of
frantic residents fled inland, grabbed all the bottled water they
could haul and hunkered down behind makeshift wind barriers of
plywood and tape.</LD>
<LD>   As the first rainy tendrils of Hurricane Lili pushed toward these
swamplands, traffic inched slowly north on back roads. Parishes
scrambled to set up shelters for the coastal refugees. Gov. Mike
Foster declared a state of emergency, and dozens of mayors along the
Gulf of Mexico readied their towns for the worst.</LD>
<LD>   "We have a real disaster in the making," said Max Mayfield,
director of the National Hurricane Center in Miami. "This is going to
be the worst hurricane to hit the Louisiana coast since
reconnaissance data has been available in the 1940s."</LD>
<TE>   The Category 4 storm was expected to blast the Gulf Coast this
morning with tidal surges, shearing winds and powerful rains. As a
fierce Lili roared in off the Gulf, residents of a swath of shoreline
from Port Arthur, Texas, in the west to the Mississippi River in the
east scrambled for shelter.</TE>
<TE>   By nightfall, Lafayette stood eerily quiet. Hotels were sold out
as many sought refuge in the more solidly constructed buildings.
Convenience stores were abandoned. Even the Wal-Mart--that perennial,
all-night, American harbor--closed its doors at 8 p.m. Damp streets
stood empty, and the air was ominously heavy.</TE>
<TE>   "This is going to be bad, maybe as bad as the hurricanes that all
the old people still talk about," said Mike Barry, glancing around
the lobby of a sold-out hotel here. Weary-eyed families wandered in
out of the night, everything from diapers to electric fans in tow.</TE>
<TE>   Entire counties were evacuated along the coastlines from the
Mississippi border to the oil patch towns of East Texas. By dusk,
hamlets, prisons, factories, farms, ports and offshore oil and gas
rigs were drained of their inhabitants.</TE>
<TE>   At Louisiana's Avery Island, home of Tabasco hot pepper sauce, the
McIlhenny Co. shut its lone bottling plant.</TE>
<TE>   "We'll be closed as long as it takes to get our power back and let
our people clean out their homes," Executive Vice President Tony
Simmons said. But he said hot-sauce lovers need not worry: "We're not
anticipating anyone running out of Tabasco."</TE>
<TE>   While wary residents fled north, authorities sent sandbags,
generators, emergency supplies and doctors to the south and braced
for a rare October hurricane in a region that has been mostly spared
so far this season.</TE>
<TE>   Workers throughout southern Louisiana were rushing to finish
repairs on levees and storm drains damaged last week by Tropical
Storm Isidore, which flooded hundreds of homes and caused about $100
million in damage there.</TE>
<TE>   "We believe we've done everything we can to prepare, and,
fortunately or unfortunately, we had Isidore last week for practice,"
said Janet Faulk, chief administrative officer in New Iberia, a city
of 33,000 that sat dead center in Lili's potential path Wednesday
night.</TE>
<TE>   The threat to low-lying towns such as New Iberia was obvious. The
highest point is 24 feet above sea level--and Lili threatens to come
ashore with 20-foot storm surges. "All we can do now is sit tight,"
Faulk said.</TE>
<TE>   Lili was a mere Category 2 late Tuesday when it headed north from
Cuba and out of the Caribbean, where the storm left eight people dead
and forced thousands of Cubans from their homes. The National Weather
Service reported Lili's sustained winds at 145 mph Wednesday and the
storm was upgraded on the Saffir-Simpson scale, which sets Category 5
as the most severe. Hurricane hunter aircraft reported gusts as great
as 150 mph near the eye late Wednesday, and the weather service said
further strengthening of the storm was possible before landfall
today.</TE>
<TE>   As Lili quickly grew in strength Wednesday from the warm Gulf
waters, NASA officials postponed the space shuttle Atlantis' launch
at Cape Canaveral, Fla., concerned that Lili's inland winds and rain
could knock out communications at Johnson Space Center in Houston.</TE>
<TE>   One computer projection of the storm's course showed Lili striking
the upper Texas coast, which could send 50-mph winds into the Houston
area. That would shut down mission control, which would prevent three
planned spacewalks by Atlantis' astronauts at the International Space
Station, a NASA spokesman said.</TE>
<TE>   The delay marked the first time that Texas weather canceled a
Florida launch, which has been tentatively reset for Monday.</TE>
<TE>   Houston, which basked in humid sunshine Wednesday, took few
precautions before the storm, although Gov. Rick Perry signed a
disaster declaration.</TE>
<TE>   The governor's action paves the way for immediate federal
emergency funds if and when the storm hits parts of the state.</TE>
<TE>   Texas' costliest hurricane was Alicia in 1983, which caused $3
billion in damage in Galveston and Houston. The state's deadliest
storm--a Category 4--killed at least 8,000 people in Galveston in
1900, a time before hurricanes were named.</TE>
<TE>   The most lethal hurricane to hit southwest Louisiana was Audrey in
1957, which killed 526 people and caused $120 million in damage.</TE>

<HD>'Shoe Bomb' Suspect Offers Guilty Plea, but With Conditions</HD>
<DH>Courts: Reid wants wording that links him to Al Qaeda
stricken from the indictment. Surprised prosecutors say they won't
budge.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD A. SERRANO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Richard C. Reid, accused of trying to blow up a transatlantic
passenger plane with explosives hidden in his shoes, intends to plead
guilty if a federal judge in Boston will strike from the indictment
any suggestion that he is an Al Qaeda-trained terrorist, his lawyers
said Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   But federal prosecutors, caught off-guard by the surprise
announcement, insisted that Reid is indeed a terrorist and said they
would urge the judge to take the case to trial next month if Reid is
trying to avoid a life sentence.</LD>
<LD>   U.S. District Judge William G. Young said he will hold a hearing
Friday on the proposed plea. He will decide how best to proceed in
what is scheduled to be the first terror-related trial in the federal
courts since the attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon.</LD>
<TE>   John Walker Lindh, the so-called American Talib, avoided trial by
pleading guilty in July to aiding the Taliban in Afghanistan. He is
set to be sentenced Friday. And the trial of Zacarias Moussaoui, the
only person charged in the United States in connection with the
attacks, was postponed for a second time this week. It is now
scheduled to begin in June.</TE>
<TE>   The unusual turn of events in the Reid case, just weeks before the
start of his Nov. 4 trial, began when lawyers for the British-born
Reid disclosed that he is ready to admit to the eight-count
indictment filed against him that alleges he tried to ignite a bomb
hidden in his sneakers during the American Airlines flight from Paris
to Miami.</TE>
<TE>   "It is the defendant's intent to admit the facts constituting the
elements of the offenses charged in those counts," his lawyers
advised the judge.</TE>
<TE>   "Namely, attempted use on Dec. 22, 2001, of a weapon of mass
destruction against one or more United States nationals while such
nationals were outside the United States, and attempted murder on
Dec. 22, 2001, of one or more such United States nationals."</TE>
<TE>   The defense filing asked the court to strike from the indictment
two paragraphs discussing Reid and Al Qaeda.</TE>
<TE>   "It was not the government's intent, as conveyed to [defense]
counsel, to present evidence at trial on the allegations" in those
paragraphs, the defense lawyers said.</TE>
<TE>   Separately, the lawyers issued a brief statement to the public
attempting to explain the personal reasons behind their client's
motives for seeking to plead guilty.</TE>
<TE>   "He wants to avoid the publicity associated with a trial and the
negative impact it is likely to have upon his family," the statement
said.</TE>
<TE>   Federal authorities, scrambling to respond to Reid's request,
emphasized that they intend to pursue a life sentence against Reid,
whether by pleading guilty or standing trial, and that they will not
budge from their assertion that he is a terrorist.</TE>
<TE>   In a one-page filing with the court late Wednesday afternoon,
prosecutors in Boston urged Young not to strike the terrorism
language from the indictment.</TE>
<TE>   "The indictment," the filing said, "contains no immaterial or
irrelevant allegations that are unfairly prejudicial to the
defendant."</TE>
<TE>   The paragraphs in question describe Al Qaeda as a "designated
foreign terrorist organization" by the U.S. and state that "Richard
Colvin Reid received training from Al Qaeda in Afghanistan."</TE>
<TE>   In addition, in earlier court filings, the government has
indicated that Reid had help from an "Al Qaeda bomb maker." They
cited a human hair and palm print found on the explosives that
belonged to someone else, even though Reid insisted he acted alone.</TE>
<TE>   Atty. Gen. John Ashcroft said the government would not retreat
from its assertions.</TE>
<TE>   "Richard Reid, like any defendant, is free to plead guilty to
criminal charges," Ashcroft said.</TE>
<TE>   But, he stressed, "the Justice Department has not entered into any
plea agreement with Reid."</TE>
<TE>   And, he added, "the Justice Department stands by each and every
allegation in the indictment. We are prepared to substantiate all of
the charges at the hearing."</TE>
<TE>   A Department of Justice official, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said both the U.S. attorney's office in Boston and Justice
Department headquarters in Washington were stunned that Reid was
willing to plead guilty to all eight counts in the
indictment--especially since it could bring an automatic sentence of
life in prison.</TE>
<TE>   "We were surprised by this," the official said. "We had no
forewarning."</TE>
<TE>   Reid, in statements he allegedly made to FBI agents after his
arrest, said that he was angry over the U.S. war in Afghanistan. He
also hoped that the plane explosion would scare Americans away from
air travel, and damage the U.S. economy.</TE>
<TE>   "What I am doing is part of the ongoing war between Islam and
disbelief," he wrote in an e-mail to his mother two days before the
flight.</TE>
<TE>   Reid also was upset over the treatment of Muslims in Israel. He
allegedly told the FBI after his arrest that he had traveled to
Jerusalem in June 2001 and became bitter when he saw "Jews with guns"
at an Arab mosque there.</TE>
<TE>   "America is the problem," he allegedly told his FBI interrogators.
"Without America, there would be no Israel."</TE>
<TE>   There also was seeming contradiction about his statement Wednesday
that he wanted to plead guilty to spare his family from unwanted
publicity. According to the FBI, once he was arrested and removed
from the plane when it was diverted to Boston, he immediately wanted
to know where the reporters were.</TE>

<HD>N.J. High Court OKs Torricelli Replacement</HD>
<DH>Election: GOP plans to file a motion opposing the decision
to allow Democrats to field Frank R. Lautenberg as their Senate
candidate.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN J. GOLDMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>TRENTON, N.J.</DL>
<LD>In an election crucial to Democratic Party hopes of retaining control
of the U.S. Senate, the New Jersey Supreme Court ruled Wednesday that
Sen. Robert Torricelli can be replaced with a new candidate on the
November ballot.</LD>
<LD>   Torricelli set off a scramble Monday when he withdrew from the
Senate race because of sagging poll numbers and political scandal.
After consultations, former Sen. Frank R. Lautenberg agreed to become
the party's candidate.</LD>
<LD>   "It is in the public interest and the general intent of the
election laws to preserve the two-party system and to submit to the
electorate a ballot bearing the names of candidates of both major
political parties as well as of all other qualifying parties," all
seven justices of the court decided.</LD>
<TE>   The state's deadline for changing a party nominee is 51 days
before an election. There are 33 days before the Nov. 5 vote.</TE>
<TE>   But in its seven-page order, the court said state election
statutes should be "liberally construed to allow the greatest scope
for participation in the electoral process to allow candidates to get
on the ballot and, most importantly, to allow the voters a choice on
election day."</TE>
<TE>   Lawyers for the Republican Senate candidate in New Jersey, Doug
Forrester, said they planned to file a motion today in U.S. District
Court in Trenton opposing the decision. They also said they would
petition U.S. Atty. Gen. John Ashcroft to order that all absentee
ballots, which already have been printed with Torricelli's name, be
mailed immediately.</TE>
<TE>   Forrester's legal team had pledged that, if necessary, it would
seek to take the case to the U.S. Supreme Court, and election law
experts said the judges' decision Wednesday could pave the way for
such an appeal.</TE>
<TE>   The New Jersey battle is vital to both parties. The Democrats have
a one-seat advantage in the closely divided Senate.</TE>
<TE>   During Wednesday's arguments before the New Jersey high court, a
Democratic Party lawyer said that unless Torricelli's name is
replaced on the ballot, voters will be disenfranchised by taking part
in a "neutered" election.</TE>
<TE>   "This is not about candidates. This is about voters and their
ability to participate in a contested election," Angelo J. Genova
argued at the expedited hearing.</TE>
<TE>   Lawyers for Forrester cautioned the court that it would be
treading on a "very slippery slope" if it allowed Lautenberg on the
ballot and that the election law should be strictly enforced.</TE>
<TE>   State Atty. Gen. David Samson told the justices that he thought
the court could "craft a remedy that allows a substitution."</TE>
<TE>   "It may be costly and inconvenient, " he said, "but I think it is
feasible."</TE>
<TE>   John M. Carbone, who represented the 21 county clerks in New
Jersey who have a central role in elections, cautioned that the
process of changing the ballots would require at least $729,000 and
that if the court didn't decide by Wednesday, "it's not going to be
doable no matter how deep the pockets."</TE>
<TE>   "I would like to see a decision by the end of the day," he said,
provoking laughter in the packed courtroom.</TE>
<TE>   The justices took Carbone seriously. They ordered the Democratic
Party in New Jersey to pay for the ballot change, estimated at
$800,000, and also required an explanatory letter to be sent to 1,600
absentee voters who already had been sent ballots naming Torricelli
as the Democratic candidate.</TE>
<TE>   Legal scholars said the GOP's decision to go to a federal judge
amounts to a new lawsuit, rather an appeal of Wednesday's ruling.</TE>
<TE>   "If I were them, I would do both. Send their lawyers into federal
court and ready [an appeal] to the Supreme Court," Stanford Law
professor Pamela Karlan said.</TE>
<TE>   She said there's a legitimate case to be made to the Supreme
Court. "They can make straightforward due process argument, that it
is unfair to change the rules in the middle of the game," she said.</TE>
<TE>   This was precisely the argument GOP lawyers made two years ago on
behalf of then-presidential candidate George W. Bush in the Florida
case. On a 5-4 vote, the Supreme Court reversed Florida's highest
court and halted a statewide manual ballot recount.</TE>
<TE>   "This would be a similar argument, and they could point to Bush
vs. Gore as a precedent," said Richard L. Hasen, an election law
expert at the Loyola Law School in Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Although New Jersey law says that the parties can change their
nominee 51 days before the election, it does not specify what happens
if the candidate quits closer to the balloting, as Torricelli did.</TE>
<TE>   "They can argue that the Legislature has made this determination
and that this [decision] is making new law," Hasen said.</TE>
<TE>   But Karlan and Hasen thought that the Supreme Court would be wary
of intervening this time.</TE>
<TE>   "Do they really want to decide who controls the Senate as well as
who is president?" Karlan asked. "There is a limit on how many times
they want to intervene to help the Republicans. This would look
blatant because a ruling [in the Republicans' favor] would guarantee
a win for the Republicans."</TE>
<TE>   By the tone of the questions the justices asked during the oral
argument, it was clear that they were leaning toward letting
Lautenberg on the ballot.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, they expressed concern about future candidates
quitting races because they plummet in the polls.</TE>
<TE>   "These are difficult choices," Associate Justice Peter G. Verniero
said at one point. "There is no easy answer to this. Isn't the most
sensible relief to provide a fund, monitor this and allow ... a fair
and full election?"</TE>

<HD>Stubborn Killer Is Deciphered as Scientists Map Malaria DNA</HD>
<DH>Health: Breakthrough may help find effective treatments,
but gains could be a decade off.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBERT LEE HOTZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>In a major advance against a disease that kills 3 million people
every year, researchers have deciphered the complete genetic makeup
of the malaria parasite and the mosquito that transmits it, an
international coalition announced Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   By unraveling all the genes that go into this lethal partnership
of pest and pestilence, scientists hope to find better ways to treat
a disease that has resisted every attempt by modern medicine to
eliminate it.</LD>
<LD>   "This truly is a landmark accomplishment," said Dr. Anthony S.
Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious
Diseases, which helped fund the research. "It is the beginning of a
new era of science in the study of malaria."</LD>
<TE>   Despite decades of systematic public health efforts, there are
half a billion new cases of malaria every year, with more cases of
the illness in Africa today than at any time in history, researchers
said. Almost 8,000 people die every day of malaria, most of them
infants and children. For the first time in 20 years, malaria
recently turned up in mosquitoes in the United States.</TE>
<TE>   Throughout the world, the mosquitoes that carry malaria have
become resistant to most insecticides used to control them, while the
disease itself has become resistant to the drugs most commonly used
in treatment. In a real sense, malaria today is the product of
efforts to control it.</TE>
<TE>   The findings announced Wednesday make for an unprecedented moment
in public health: For the first time, researchers have in hand the
complete genetic sequence of a disease parasite, the insect that
transmits it and the human host who is racked by its killing fevers.</TE>
<TE>   The resulting genetic insights into malaria could lead to new
insecticides, effective vaccines, better medicines and genetically
engineered insects that break the cycle of disease transmission.</TE>
<TE>   By looking for biochemical vulnerabilities in the malaria parasite
itself, researchers already have identified five potential targets
for new medications.</TE>
<TE>   Yet so many other obstacles remain--technical, environmental and
financial--that it may be a decade or more before the unraveling of
the genomes has any direct effect on the disease, several malaria
control experts said.</TE>
<TE>   They tempered their enthusiasm for the news with caution about the
difficulties of translating such research breakthroughs into
effective treatments that people in the world's most underdeveloped
countries--where 90% of the illness is concentrated--can afford.</TE>
<TE>   "Genome sequences alone provide little relief to those suffering
from malaria," said molecular geneticist Russell Doolittle at UC San
Diego. "Translating all of this information into new treatments and
cures is not a trivial exercise."</TE>
<TE>   The genome breakthroughs, announced in Washington and London,
arise from the collaboration of 160 researchers in 10 countries. One
international team sequenced the mosquito genes, while the other
sequenced the genes of the malaria parasite. In all, the effort took
six years.</TE>
<TE>   Research papers concerning the malaria genome are being published
today in the journal Nature. Technical papers on the mosquito genome
were released Wednesday on the Internet by the journal Science.</TE>
<TE>   A consortium of 19 laboratories led by Robert Holt, a senior
scientist at Celera Genomics Inc. in Rockville, Md., deciphered the
genetic sequence of the most deadly malaria mosquito--known formally
as Anopheles gambiae--a living hypodermic needle with an instinctive
thirst for human blood.</TE>
<TE>   From a public health standpoint, the researchers said, it is "the
most important insect in the world." In all, 60 species of mosquito
transmit malaria. The malaria mosquito breeds in places such as water
barrels, irrigation ditches, tires and the tiny pools that gather in
footprints in the mud after it rains. Dozens of species can swarm in
the same area.</TE>
<TE>   Primarily responsible for transmitting malaria in Africa, it is
the biochemical product of a genome containing approximately 278
million base pairs of DNA that encompass about 14,000 genes, the
Celera team determined.</TE>
<TE>   By comparison, the human genome has about 3 billion base pairs of
DNA and contains an estimated 35,000 genes.</TE>
<TE>   An international team led by researcher Malcolm Gardner at the
Institute for Genomic Research in Rockville unraveled the genetic
chemistry of the deadliest and most common of the four variants of
the parasite that causes the disease.</TE>
<TE>   The malaria parasite, known formally as Plasmodium falciparum,
owes its existence to a genetic sequence containing 24 million base
pairs of DNA, with about 5,300 genes.</TE>
<TE>   Its genome was smaller, more complex and harder to piece together
than scientists expected.</TE>
<TE>   At least half of the malaria genes appear to be unique, appearing
in no other gene database so far. And almost 80% of the parasite's
genome is a stuttering gibberish composed of just two of the four
letters in the chemical alphabet of DNA, making it very difficult for
researchers to tell where pieces of the sequence start and stop.</TE>
<TE>   "This was perhaps the most difficult genome we ever have
sequenced, despite the fact it is smaller than many," Gardner said.
"It was a huge jigsaw puzzle, with many pieces that did not quite fit
together."</TE>
<TE>   The complete genetic script for the parasite and the pest that
carries it from person to person may help unlock the complicated
three-stage life cycle of malaria.</TE>
<TE>   The new genetic information gives scientists the opportunity to
understand a biochemical parry and thrust between species that have
been evolving for thousands of years, said tropical disease expert
Dyann Wirth, head of Harvard University's Malaria Initiative. That
may reveal how the malaria parasite is so adept at evading the immune
system defenses of those it infects.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a huge advance," Wirth said. "We can look now for the
Achilles' heel."</TE>
<TE>   The mosquito passes the malaria parasite to humans when the
infected insect feeds on their blood. As it sucks up blood, the
insect injects saliva that contains the parasite.</TE>
<TE>   Once in the bloodstream, the parasite migrates to the liver, where
it multiplies, forming dense cysts. The cysts eventually burst,
flooding the bloodstream with parasites, setting in motion the next
round of malaria's infectious life cycle.</TE>
<TE>   When the next mosquito bites, it sucks up the parasite. The
parasite reproduces and its young migrate to the mosquito salivary
glands, where they are injected next time the insect bites someone.</TE>
<TE>   Without the mosquito, the parasite languishes and dies. Without
its blood meal, the biting mosquito cannot breed. It needs the blood
to nurture its eggs.</TE>
<TE>   The Anopheles gambiae mosquito is so deadly, in part, because it
feeds almost exclusively on human blood, unlike other closely related
mosquito species. Scientists generally agree that the malaria
mosquitoes somehow can sniff out their preferred human prey,
apparently attuned to the rank smell of feet, among other things.</TE>
<TE>   In all, researchers have identified 276 genes involved in the
mosquito's sensory systems. At least 19 of the newly sequenced genes
appear to be involved in the insect's ability to detect odors,
including the smell of human blood. That may offer a way for
researches to derail the insect's ability to find and feed on human
beings.</TE>
<TE>   "If we can identify the receptors that mosquitoes use to smell
humans, we should be able to design novel repellents that can
substantially reduce the incidence of malaria, West Nile
encephalitis, dengue and yellow fever and other mosquito-borne
diseases," said biologist Laurence Zweibel at Vanderbilt University,
who helped decipher the genes.</TE>
<TE>   Malaria experts are even more anxious to identify the genes
responsible for the insect's growing resistance to insecticides used
to control it.</TE>
<TE>   Other research teams are seeking ways to make the insect itself
resistant to the disease parasite.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier this year, researchers were able to genetically modify
mosquitoes so that some forms of the parasite could not survive
inside them. Scientists now have identified a few genes in mosquitoes
that reduce the natural transmission of the most lethal malaria
parasite.</TE>
<TE>   "The new genes we have found are the first ones that make the
Anopheles mosquito highly resistant to real, natural populations of
the most deadly of the human malaria parasites, as opposed to
laboratory parasite strains," said New York University parasitologist
Kenneth Vernick, who led the research team. As many as half the
mosquitoes in the wild may carry genes for parasite resistance.</TE>
<TE>   But the new genome information reveals that the parasite appears
unusually well-equipped to evade such molecular defenses, Wirth said.</TE>
<TE>   The parasite's ability to mutate also allows it to quickly develop
resistance to drugs.</TE>
<TE>   "I was surprised," she said, "at the number and variety of genes
that are apparently involved in the evasion of the immune response."</TE>

<HD>Bush Calls for Nationwide Expansion of 'Amber Alerts'</HD>
<DH>Crime: Government will provide $10 million to upgrade
system aimed at finding missing children.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Emerging from a tear-filled private session with families of
kidnapped children, President Bush said Wednesday that "predators
that are smooth and seductive" must be fought by expanding nationwide
the system of broadcasting urgent bulletins when a child is taken.</LD>
<LD>   "Our society has a duty, has a solemn duty to shield children from
exploitation and danger," Bush told about 600 heartbroken but
still-hopeful family members, law enforcement officials and experts
gathered for a White House-sponsored conference. "One is too many,
particularly for the mom or dad who suffers deeply."</LD>
<LD>   Bush said the federal government would help turn the now-patchwork
use of "Amber alerts" into a coordinated nationwide network, with $10
million for training and equipment upgrades. He also announced that
the Justice Department would establish a national standard for the
alerts and assign a new federal Amber alert coordinator to boost
cooperation among state and local plans.</LD>
<TE>   A series of high-profile child abductions--Samantha Runnion and
Danielle van Dam in California, Cassandra Williamson in Missouri and
Elizabeth Smart in Utah among them--have filled the headlines and
terrified parents.</TE>
<TE>   Before his remarks, Bush held an emotional 45-minute meeting
behind closed doors with about a dozen people involved in
missing-children cases.</TE>
<TE>   Tamara Brooks recounted the day she and fellow teenager Jacqueline
Marris were abducted at gunpoint in Lancaster, Calif. The girls were
rescued 12 hours later when sheriff's deputies closed in on their
abductor's stolen car in a remote location--with the help of Amber
alerts, Tamara's mother said--and shot him to death.</TE>
<TE>   The daylong White House Conference on Missing, Exploited and
Runaway Children also sought to address youth homelessness, the
trafficking of children for sex and labor, and the sexual
solicitation and exploitation of children over the Internet.</TE>
<TE>   Bush called for action on a number of fronts, urging the Senate to
approve legislation--as the House already has--bypassing a Supreme
Court decision that struck down a ban of computer simulations of
child pornography.</TE>
<TE>   The president issued a rare rebuke of the Republican-controlled
House for failing to act on a measure that would provide $25 million
to help create a national Amber alert network. The Senate approved
the bill in September.</TE>
<TE>   Activists have sought to expand the use of the alerts, developed
after the 1996 kidnapping and murder of 9-year-old Amber Hagerman in
Arlington, Texas. There now are 66 plans at the local, regional and
state levels, while 24 states have adopted statewide systems.</TE>
<TE>   Law enforcement agencies that choose to participate issue urgent
bulletins--including photos and other information about missing
children and their abductors--to television and radio stations via
the Cold War-era Emergency Alert System. Some states also flash
alerts to drivers on roadside emergency signs.</TE>
<TE>   The mother of Elizabeth Smart, who was taken from her Salt Lake
City bedroom in June and remains missing, praised the conference.</TE>
<TE>   "It's wonderful to be here, but it's very painful too to hear all
the statistics and the outcome of so many children," Lois Smart said.</TE>

<HD>Women Linked to Missing Florida Girl Charged With Fraud</HD>
<DH>Crime: One of the two, claiming to be Rilya Wilson's kin,
has prison record and 46 aliases.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN-THOR DAHLBURG</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>MIAMI</DL>
<LD>Two women caring for a young Florida girl when she vanished from
state custody were arrested Wednesday and charged with welfare fraud,
having allegedly exploited their caretaker status to steal more than
$27,000.</LD>
<LD>   One of the women had claimed to be the grandmother of Rilya
Wilson, who turned 6 on Sunday. But the woman--identified as "Jane
Doe" in the arrest warrant because authorities are not certain who
she is--has 46 known aliases in six states, a criminal record dating
to 1975 and also served two years in a Tennessee state prison on a
felony conviction for food stamp fraud, Florida officials said.</LD>
<LD>   Doyle Jourdan, regional director for the Florida Department of Law
Enforcement, said authorities hope that the arrests of the women and
of Jane Doe's son and daughter will yield information about what
happened to the missing girl.</LD>
<TE>   "We think that the people that we have arrested today are the
people who most likely know the whereabouts of Rilya Wilson," Jourdan
said at a news conference. "They're the last known people to have
seen her that we are aware of."</TE>
<TE>   The disappearance of the Miami-area child, the daughter of an
admitted crack addict, ignited a scandal concerning the work of the
state Department of Children &amp; Families, and led to the resignation
of that agency's director. Republican Gov. Jeb Bush, who is up for
reelection next month, has taken heat from Democrats for what they
say are broken promises to improve care for children in state
custody.</TE>
<TE>   Rilya's caretakers, who have identified themselves as half sisters
Geralyn and Pamela Graham, said they hadn't seen the girl since a
woman claiming to be from the Department of Children &amp; Families came
to get her in January 2001. But everything the arrested women said is
now suspect, said State Atty. Katherine Fernandez Rundle of
Miami-Dade County.</TE>
<TE>   Jane Doe, who calls herself Geralyn Graham and is thought to be in
her mid-50s, "became a grandmother for the money only," Rundle said.
It is not known whether the Grahams are related, she added.</TE>
<TE>   "We do know that Jane Doe is the central figure in a series of
frauds which depended on having the custody--that was the key, that
was the instrumentality of her crime--the custody of Rilya Wilson,"
the prosecutor said.</TE>
<TE>   According to Rundle, while Rilya was living with them, the
caretakers concocted a scheme to use fake identities and forged
documents to fraudulently obtain state child-care vouchers, Medicaid
assistance, food stamps and temporary cash welfare payments for needy
families. Their combined illicit take, according to documents
provided at the news conference, exceeded $27,000, some of which was
received after Rilya vanished.</TE>
<TE>   The women were not charged in her disappearance.</TE>
<TE>   Pamela Graham already was the legally appointed caretaker of
Rilya's younger sister Rodericka. State child-care workers placed
Rilya with her in April 2000, believing that it was in the siblings'
best interest to be under the same roof. Jane Doe then allegedly
forged a court order to show that she was the girls' paternal
grandmother, which entitled her to welfare benefits she otherwise had
no right to, Jourdan said.</TE>
<TE>   Rodericka was removed from the home last spring, after Rilya was
discovered missing.</TE>
<TE>   In their widening search for leads, investigators allege that Jane
Doe's children, Leo and Jacqueline Epson, also committed crimes
including grand theft and public assistance fraud, Rundle said. The
two were "learning the dirty family business of lying, cheating and
committing fraud," the prosecutor said.</TE>
<TE>   Also Wednesday, a reward for information leading to Rilya's return
was increased from $75,000 to $100,000. Officials said they are
proceeding on the premise that the girl is alive, but they
acknowledged that they have no proof.</TE>
<TE>   "As we start to peel this whole case apart, it's like an onion,"
Rundle said. "You keep finding new things."</TE>
<TE>   "This is going to move us closer [to finding Rilya]. We believe
that," Jourdan said of the arrests.</TE>
<TE>   Jane Doe, who has a Mississippi birth certificate in the name of
Geraldine Thomas, is considered a flight risk and was jailed on
$600,000 bond. She is charged with public assistance fraud, document
forgery, driver's license fraud, title fraud and making a false
affidavit.</TE>
<TE>   Pamela Graham, who authorities said has used at least one alias,
was charged with grand theft, welfare fraud and aiding and abetting
public assistance fraud. Bail was set at $140,000.</TE>
<TE>   Bush called the arrests proof of his intention "to leave no stone
unturned" in the notorious missing persons case.</TE>
<TE>   Rilya was supposed to get monthly visits from a DCF official, but
her case worker allegedly filed reports on the child without actually
checking on her. It wasn't until April 25 that the department
realized it didn't know the girl's whereabouts and notified police.</TE>
<TE>   Jourdan said that, without the intense official scrutiny and media
furor surrounding Rilya's disappearance, the benefits fraud probably
would have gone undetected.</TE>
<TE>   Likewise, background checks on people claiming benefits for
state-placed children were inadequate.</TE>
<TE>   "There is a glitch, if you like," Rundle said, "that exists in the
system, and we hope DCF will fix that."</TE>

<HD>New Evidence Delays Bail Ruling for 6 N.Y. Terror Suspects</HD>
<DH>Court: Judge sets hearing on allegations about a suicide
bomb manual, use of multiple identities.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOSH GETLIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>A federal judge has delayed a decision on granting bail to six
Buffalo-area men accused of receiving terrorist training at an Al
Qaeda camp, amid new evidence introduced this week by prosecutors.</LD>
<LD>   U.S. Magistrate H. Kenneth Schroeder, who had been expected to
rule today on granting bail, postponed the decision until next week
at the request of defense attorneys. He scheduled a hearing today in
a Buffalo federal court to hear arguments on new allegations tying
one of the defendants to a document about suicide bombings, written
in Arabic.</LD>
<LD>   The latest evidence, which had been filed in court papers by the
Joint Terrorism Task Force of Western New York, also suggests that
some of the men from Lackawanna--a small steel town south of
Buffalo--had used multiple identities. All the defendants are
American citizens of Yemeni descent.</LD>
<TE>   "My decision will be delayed," Schroeder said after meeting with
attorneys on both sides. "We're not going to rush this thing
through."</TE>
<TE>   Last month, Schroeder held a three-day bail hearing on the case of
the so-called Lackawanna Six. Federal prosecutors have said the six
men should remain in custody because they pose a flight risk and
could threaten public security. Investigators allege that the men are
members of a sleeper cell who heard a speech by Osama bin Laden while
they spent time in the camp in the summer of 2001 and could be called
upon by Al Qaeda operatives to commit terrorist acts.</TE>
<TE>   Defense attorneys, however, have said their clients are innocent
and should not be denied bail. Keeping the six men in jail until
their trial begins, which could be more than a year away, would be
punitive, the attorneys added.</TE>
<TE>   All of the defendants could receive maximum sentences of 15 years
if they are convicted of supporting terrorists. Two of the men,
Mukhtar al-Bakri, 22, and Sahim Alwan, 29, have told federal
investigators that they spent time in an Al Qaeda camp in
Afghanistan. They have insisted, however, that they did not know of
any plans by terrorists to attack the United States.</TE>
<TE>   The other defendants--Yasein Taher, 24; Faysal Galab, 26; Shafal
Mosed, 24; and Yahya Goba, 25--have neither confirmed nor denied that
they spent time in the terrorist network's camp. The case has sparked
anger in the local Yemeni community, which has rallied in defense of
the six men.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. Atty. William J. Hochul Jr., who is leading the prosecution,
said that the newest evidence--especially the suicide bombing manual,
which was found in a weekend search of Taher's apartment--constituted
"clear and convincing evidence" that the six men would pose a threat
to safety if they were granted bail by Schroeder.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors have not said that Taher wrote what they described as
a "chilling" and "scary" document, entitled "Definition of Martyrdom
Operations, and Their Effect on the Enemy." The document notes that
the common practice in suicide bombings is to "wire up one's body, or
a vehicle or suitcase with explosives, and then to enter amongst a
conglomeration of the enemy ... and to detonate in an appropriate
place there in order to cause the maximum losses in enemy ranks."</TE>
<TE>   "As for the effects of these operations on the enemy," the
document continues, "we have found, through the course of our
experience, that there is no other technique which strikes as much
terror into their hearts, and which shatters their spirit as much."</TE>
<TE>   Taher's attorney, Rodney Personius, said the document was in fact
an academic essay about the ethics of suicide attacks that could have
been lifted off the Internet, and he blasted prosecutors for quoting
only the most "inflammatory" segments in their court filings.</TE>

<HD>Fla. Executes 1 Killer, Clears Way for 2nd</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>STARKE, Fla.</DL>
<LD>A man who killed an 11-year-old girl and two fellow death row inmates
was executed by injection Wednesday as the way was cleared for a
female serial killer to be put to death. She also was declared
mentally competent to abandon appeals.</LD>
<LD>   Rigoberto Sanchez-Velasco, 43, was declared mentally competent
Tuesday after an examination by three state-appointed psychiatrists.
The decision on the competency of serial killer Aileen Wuornos came
Wednesday, and her execution will take place next week as planned,
Gov. Jeb Bush said.</LD>
<LD>   Sanchez-Velasco, who came to Miami from Cuba in the 1980 Mariel
boatlift, had confessed to the girl's murder but denied it in a
statement he gave to a priest Tuesday night.</LD>
<TE>   "I did not commit the crime for which I will die. It does not
matter who believes me and who won't believe me," he wrote. "I cannot
call myself totally innocent because I have committed all kinds of
sins, including murder. I am receiving my punishment and I am proud
to receive my punishment for those lives I have taken."</TE>
<TE>   Bush lifted a stay of execution Tuesday for Sanchez-Velasco. The
same day he issued a stay for Wuornos.</TE>
<TE>   Wuornos' attorney had argued that she was not mentally competent
to drop her appeals. But three psychiatrists who interviewed her
Tuesday reported to Bush that she understood she would die and why
she was being executed.</TE>
<TE>   Her lawyer, Raag Singhal, said Wednesday he has concerns about her
competence, adding that he wished the medical evaluation had been "a
whole movie and not just a snapshot."</TE>
<TE>   Death penalty opponents said allowing the inmates to drop appeals
is equivalent to state-assisted suicide.</TE>
<TE>   Sanchez-Velasco was sentenced to death in 1988 for the slaying of
Kathy Ecenarro, the daughter of his live-in girlfriend. He was given
two 15-year sentences for killing two fellow death row inmates.</TE>
<TE>   Wuornos, 46, was convicted of fatally shooting six middle-aged men
along the highways of north and central Florida in 1989 and 1990. Her
story has been portrayed in two movies, three books and an opera.</TE>
<TE>   She is scheduled to die Oct. 9.</TE>

<HD>Gore Assails Bush on the Economy</HD>
<DH>Politics: In his second jab in 10 days, the Democrat
assails the president's 'Enron accounting' policy. His comments are
one of the most visible efforts yet to turn public attention to the
nation's financial state.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAMES GERSTENZANG</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Delivering his second sharp criticism of the White House in 10 days,
Al Gore said Wednesday that President Bush's economic policy was
built on "Enron accounting," and he called for a reassessment of the
administration's economic blueprint.</LD>
<LD>   "Like a lost driver who won't stop to ask for directions, the
president clutches his old plan and continues racing in the wrong
direction, farther and farther into the economic wilderness, with the
fate of nearly 300 million Americans in tow," the former vice
president said.</LD>
<LD>   Gore urged Bush to devote the same energy to solving the nation's
economic problems that he has to preparing for a war with Iraq.
Offering a limited economic prescription, Gore called for extended
unemployment benefits and unspecified help for small business "to
jolt the U.S. economy out of stagnation and start creating jobs
again."</LD>
<TE>   Taken with a speech he gave in San Francisco last week, in which
he questioned the wisdom of invading Iraq before ending the campaign
against terrorism, Gore's remarks Wednesday put him at the front of
those taking issue with the foreign and economic policies established
by the Republican who defeated him for the presidency two years ago.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, it represented the most visible effort yet by a
prominent Democrat to turn the public's attention to the nation's
economic uncertainties, which the party hopes will propel it to gains
in the Nov. 5 midterm elections.</TE>
<TE>   Equating Bush policies with the accounting sleights of hand that
brought down Enron Corp., the Houston-based energy company, Gore said
the president and his aides "are projecting revenues that will never
appear, and they are hiding expenditures that will appear."</TE>
<TE>   Asked for comment, Claire Buchan, White House deputy press
secretary, did not address Gore's remarks directly, saying that Bush
had presented three overarching goals--protecting national security,
protecting the American homeland and protecting economic
security--and that "he has delivered on that agenda."</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, she said, Bush "is calling on the Congress to
act" on such central economic elements as a proposal to help
companies obtain insurance against terrorist attacks and energy
legislation while holding down spending.</TE>
<TE>   Referring to Gore, Senate Minority Leader Trent Lott (R-Miss.)
said: "I guess he's trying to get back in the dialogue. I guess he's
trying to find some way to become relevant for 2004. But I think he's
missed the boat."</TE>
<TE>   Given the increasing demands on the federal budget, Gore said any
reassessment of the administration's economic plan must ask how it
can simultaneously pay for a war with Iraq, which the Congressional
Budget Office estimates could cost as much as $9 billion a month,
while meeting the costs of beefed-up homeland security, Social
Security and Medicare.</TE>
<TE>   He said Bush "ought to have an open mind and accept responsibility
for the fact that what he thought would happen, what he said would
happen, ain't happening." Gore ticked off what he said were the
economic developments under Bush's stewardship: the evaporation of a
federal budget surplus that had been forecast at $5 trillion over 10
years; the decline, every quarter, of business investment; the stock
market's loss of more than a quarter of its value; a 10% drop in the
purchasing power of those earning the minimum wage; a 27% increase in
health insurance premiums; and mortgage foreclosures at a 30-year
high.</TE>
<TE>   His speech took place during the week when third-quarter reports
on investments are arriving in mailboxes, bringing reminders to homes
across the country of the drop in the stock market.</TE>
<TE>   Gore has kept a low profile since the 2000 election, drawing
criticism from some Democrats that he should have been more out front
in opposing Bush policies. But he is slowly returning to public view,
giving rise to the question he has said he will answer by the end of
the year: Will he again seek the presidency?</TE>
<TE>   Asked how, given his criticism of Bush, he could not run again,
Gore cracked: "Well, I didn't vote for the guy."</TE>
<TE>   He said he had promised his wife, Tipper, and their family that he
would take two years off "to try to get some financial security." A
member of the audience interjected, "Great timing!" in reference to
the economic downturn. Gore replied: "I wish I'd been out there doing
this during the Clinton-Gore years, I'll tell you that."</TE>
<TE>   The Gores, who moved to Arlington, Va., after he left office, have
recently bought a house in Nashville, allowing him to renew his roots
in the state that he represented in the House and the Senate but
which Bush won by nearly 4%. Gore spoke at the Brookings Institution
to an audience of scholars from the nonpartisan research
organization, and former campaign aides and staff members of the
Clinton administration.</TE>
<TE>   As critical as he was about Bush's policies, Gore did not single
out specific measures--particularly the 10-year, $1.35-trillion tax
cut that Bush made the signature of his first months in office. Such
an attack could cause political problems for several Democratic
senators who voted for it and who are now in close reelection
campaigns.</TE>
<TE>   To buttress his argument that it was time to reassess
administration policies built on tax cuts that helped push up a
federal budget deficit that had disappeared during the Clinton
administration, Gore used a metaphor from the sports world of which
Bush is so fond:</TE>
<TE>   "At halftime, any football coach worth his salt will look at
what's working and what's not. We're at halftime in this term. The
game plan's not working. The economy's in serious trouble."</TE>
<TE>   The White House solution, Gore said, "is to tell us, 'Don't worry.
Things will fix themselves.' Well, it takes more than words to
restore confidence in our economy. It takes action. Cheerleading will
not restore confidence--a responsible economic plan can."</TE>
<TE>   Thomas E. Mann, a senior fellow at Brookings, said the speech
appeared designed to help Democrats generate "some public debate and
traction on the economy" while attention is focused on Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   Gore said that Bush and Congress need to focus, in the month
before election day, on how to get the economy "back on track." Delay
could risk a global recession, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "If we turn a blind eye to our weak economy, it will eventually
undermine everything else that we're trying to accomplish, whether
it's winning the war against terrorism or giving all families the
economic opportunities they deserve," Gore said.</TE>
<TE>   At the end of the program, Gore was asked why he had stopped
wearing his wedding ring.</TE>
<TE>   "Because," the now-bulky former vice president said, "I've gained
so much weight I couldn't get it off. Actually, I could get it off--I
couldn't get it back on again. But I'm making a reassessment of my
personal diet."</TE>
<TE>   Tipper Gore, in the front row of the audience, jumped up, waved
and pointed out that she was wearing her ring.</TE>

<HD>Ex-New York Officer Held in Shooting Spree</HD>
<DH>Crime: Dismissed from the force over a drug offense, he
allegedly fired at people from his apartment, wounding a preschool
teacher.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>A former police officer shooting from his apartment window wounded a
preschool teacher taking children to a playground during a three-hour
spree in a sprawling housing complex.</LD>
<LD>   Arresting officers found Brian Berrigan, 33, sitting at a table
inside his fourth-floor apartment at Stuyvesant Town, Police
Commissioner Ray Kelly said.</LD>
<LD>   He was "crying like a baby" when police entered his apartment to
take him into custody, said one officer at the scene. Police found
other weapons inside the apartment.</LD>
<TE>   During the attack, bullets crashed through windows and into parked
cars, grazing the shoulder of the 22-year-old teacher, whose name was
not released. There was no indication that the shooter knew the
teacher.</TE>
<TE>   None of the children from the Manhattan Kids Club preschool was
injured, and the teacher was released from Bellevue Hospital after
treatment, Kelly said.</TE>
<TE>   At least 20 shots were fired, including one at a police car.</TE>
<TE>   "He was firing at windows. He fired at people. He fired at the
police vehicle," Kelly said.</TE>
<TE>   Police cordoned off sections of the sprawling development as
officers in helmets and bulletproof vests searched for the shooter.
Berrigan was taken to a police station for questioning. An officer
for two years, he was dismissed in 1997 after a routine drug test
detected cocaine in his system, Kelly said.</TE>
<TE>   Charges against the former officer were pending.</TE>

<HD>Houston District Wins Urban Education Prize</HD>
<DH>Schools: Award brings $500,000 in scholarships. Finalists
include Garden Grove and Long Beach.</DH>

<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The Houston Independent School District was awarded the first Broad
Prize for Urban Education on Wednesday, receiving $500,000 in college
scholarships for improving student achievement and bridging gaps
between ethnic and socioeconomic groups.</LD>
<LD>   Orange County's Garden Grove Unified School District was among
four other finalists for the award, along with Long Beach Unified
School District, the Atlanta Public Schools and the Boston Public
Schools. The four will each receive $125,000 in college scholarships.</LD>
<LD>   The Broad Foundation, a Los Angeles-based organization that
promotes achievement in public schools, presented the first national
award at a ceremony in Washington attended by school officials and
lawmakers, including Sens. Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.) and Hillary
Rodham Clinton (D-N.Y.).</LD>
<TE>   The Houston district's management methods will be showcased
nationwide over the next year as a model for other urban school
districts, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   "Just to have been nominated for this prestigious award is strong
recognition of the work being done by our schools to improve the
achievement of all students in the district," said Bob Harden,
president of Garden Grove's board of education. Garden Grove is
Orange County's second-largest public school district and serves
50,000 students.</TE>
<TE>   The five finalists were chosen out of 100 large urban school
districts in late September. A review board composed of business,
government and education leaders looked at several factors--including
test scores, attendance, dropout rates and achievement gaps between
ethnic and economic groups.</TE>
<TE>   The board chose Houston for the grand prize because, in addition
to demonstrating the most academic improvement, it decreased the
achievement gap between white students and their Latino and black
counterparts, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   In 1996, there was a 16.5% gap in the percentage of Latino and
white elementary school students at reading proficiency for their
grade level. The gap was reduced to 9.8% in 2001. The proficiency gap
between white and black students also shrank, from 18.1% to 10.3%
between 1996 and 2001.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. Secretary of Education Rod Paige, a former superintendent of
the Houston school district, said the awardees will be used as
national models for public education.</TE>
<TE>   " 'No child left behind' can't be accomplished without great
schools like these across the nation," Paige said, referring to
President Bush's proposed education reform legislation.</TE>
<TE>   The Broad Foundation was established in 1999 with an endowment
from businessman Eli Broad and his family.</TE>

<HD>Judge Postpones Tobacco Firms' Trial</HD>

<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The U.S. government's racketeering lawsuit against Philip Morris Cos.
and other cigarette makers was postponed Wednesday until September
2004 by a federal judge who said wrangling over pretrial document
exchanges will make a 2003 trial date difficult to meet.</LD>
<LD>   U.S. District Judge Gladys Kessler said the Justice Department and
the cigarette makers differ over whether some government documents
should be given to the companies.</LD>
<LD>   Nearly 40 million pages of documents have been exchanged, Kessler
said. With dozens of pending motions, many containing complex issues,
Kessler said delaying the trial is fair.</LD>
<TE>   "Despite the best efforts" of the court, "it is clear that the
existing trial date of July 15, 2003, cannot be met," she said.</TE>
<TE>   The Justice Department sued in 1999, seeking $20 billion in
damages. The suit claimed that the companies, including R.J. Reynolds
Tobacco Holdings Inc. and Lorillard Inc., engaged in a 30-year
pattern of racketeering to mislead the public and Congress about the
risks of smoking.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, the judge threw out U.S. claims to recoup money spent
by the government to treat ill smokers through Medicare and other
health care programs.</TE>
<TE>   In recent court filings, the U.S. said it is asking that cigarette
warning labels cover half of the display surfaces of all packaging
and that health information messages from the U.S. surgeon general be
inserted or placed on side panels of all tobacco products.</TE>
<TE>   The Justice Department's suit also names Liggett Group Inc. and
Brown &amp; Williamson Tobacco Corp. Two tobacco industry trade groups,
the Tobacco Institute and the Council for Tobacco Research, also were
sued.</TE>

<HD>Police Taunts Detailed in '69 Killing</HD>
<DH>Trial: Man at rally says a defendant's actions led him to
think someone was 'backing us up.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>YORK, Pa.</DL>
<LD>Police officers told scores of white gang members to protect their
neighborhood before chanting "white power!" with their fists thrust
in the air, witnesses testified Wednesday in the trial of three men
charged with killing a young black woman during a 1969 race riot.</LD>
<LD>   One of the officers, Charlie Robertson, 68, is charged with murder
along with two other men who prosecutors say were members of the
white gangs that gunned down Lillie Belle Allen, 27.</LD>
<LD>   Robertson, who went on to become a two-term mayor of this central
Pennsylvania city, is accused of inciting gang members to violence
against blacks and handing out ammunition to at least one of the
gunmen at a rally before the slaying.</LD>
<TE>   "I got the impression from Mr. Robertson's actions that we were
kind of in the right and we had somebody backing us up," testified
Stewart Aldinger, who was 15 when he attended the gang rally.</TE>
<TE>   One night later, a white mob shot Allen to death as she tried to
help her panicking sister turn the family's car around on Newberry
Street in the predominantly white Cottage Hill neighborhood.</TE>
<TE>   While Robertson has admitted that he shouted "white power!" during
the rally, he denies the accusations and has apologized for his
behavior, saying he no longer harbors racist beliefs.</TE>
<TE>   Aldinger and another former gang member, Fred Flickinger, appeared
in front of the all-white jury on the second day of testimony.</TE>
<TE>   After the rally, Robertson drove to a corner cigar shop used as a
gang hangout, said Flickinger, who was 20 at the time.</TE>
<TE>   "You know, if I weren't a cop, I'd be out leading commando raids"
in the black neighborhoods, Flickinger said Robertson told gang
members who gathered around him.</TE>
<TE>   Robertson's lead attorney, William Costopoulos, told reporters
later that none of the witnesses said Robertson had encouraged them
to commit a criminal act. "It's not murder," Costopoulos said.</TE>
<TE>   Allen's slaying came on the fifth day of the riots and three days
after a white patrolman was shot in a black neighborhood.</TE>
<TE>   The patrolman, Henry Schaad, 22, died Aug. 1, 1969. Two black men
will stand trial in his death later.</TE>
<TE>   Defense attorneys argued that the residents of Newberry Street
were paranoid because black youths had driven a Cadillac into the
neighborhood to stage a drive-by shooting and later delivered what
was perceived as a threat of violence. They said Allen's shooting was
an unfortunate coincidence.</TE>
<TE>   Russell Wantz, a witness to the shooting, recalled the barrage of
shots.</TE>
<TE>   "The tires were shot out, the windows were shot out from the car,"
he testified. "It was like war."</TE>
<TE>   Another witness, Robert Stoner, said that after the smoke cleared,
he saw the outline of the Cadillac riddled with bullets and next to
it, Allen's body.</TE>
<TE>   Stoner also said he saw Robertson's co-defendants, Robert
Messersmith and Gregory Neff, and both were carrying long-barreled
guns in full view of Robertson and other police officers who arrived
soon after.</TE>
<TE>   Stoner testified that he saw Robertson speaking with at least one
armed youth, but that police neither made any arrests nor took any
statements.</TE>

<LD>John Wooden, who will turn 92 on Oct. 14, spoke at a businessmen's
breakfast at Pauley Pavilion this week, quoting Abraham Lincoln and
Mother Teresa, among others, and reciting poetry.</LD>
<LD>   Afterward, someone in the audience asked, "How do you stay so
mentally sharp? You're the same as you were 20 or 30 years ago."</LD>
<LD>   Said Wooden with a smile: "If you really think that, I may have to
question your mental sharpness."</LD>
<TE>   Trivia time: Which five players from the 1995 Angels are playing
in this season's division playoffs for other teams?</TE>
<TE>   Dog-gone: Tom FitzGerald in the San Francisco Chronicle: "A dog
wandered onto the cricket field during the final of the ICC Champions
Trophy in Sri Lanka between India and the home nation.</TE>
<TE>   "Ananova.com reports the dog was escorted off the field, but not
until umpire David Shepherd whipped out a soccer-style red card and
flashed it at the invader."</TE>
<TE>   More FitzGerald: "Seattle strong safety Reggie Tongue intercepted
two passes, returning one 46 yards for a touchdown and recovered a
fumble to set up another touchdown on Sunday night.</TE>
<TE>   "So, on top of taking a 48-23 licking, the winless Vikings were
administered a Tongue-lashing."</TE>
<TE>   Hardship case: Ron Rapoport in the Chicago Sun-Times: "Faced with
big losses to revenue sharing, George Steinbrenner has cut back on
expenses in a big way.</TE>
<TE>   "The Newark Star-Ledger says he has ordered a 60% reduction in
Yankee Stadium elevator operators and a two-thirds reduction in
luxury box hostesses."</TE>
<TE>   Willing to wait: Rickey Henderson was asked by the Cleveland Plain
Dealer to name the toughest pitcher he has faced: "Goose Gossage,"
the 43-year-old Red Sox outfielder replied. "I think I faced him
eight times, and he probably struck me out eight times.</TE>
<TE>   "I told him, 'When we meet in an old-timers' game, I'm going to
get a hit off you, stop the game and retrieve the ball.' "</TE>
<TE>   No easy rider: Len Casanova, the former Oregon football coach who
died Monday at 97, once said of assistant coach John McKay: "Some of
the stuff he suggested was too far out for us at Oregon. We had to
reject some of his plays because we would have needed motorcycles to
make them work."</TE>
<TE>   McKay found the motorcycle riders at USC, where he won four
national championships.</TE>
<TE>   Looking back: On this day in 1951, Bobby Thomson hit a three-run
homer off Ralph Branca of the Brooklyn Dodgers in the bottom of the
ninth to give the New York Giants a dramatic 5-4 playoff victory and
the National League pennant.</TE>
<TE>   Trivia answer: Chuck Finley and Jim Edmonds with the St. Louis
Cardinals, Brian Anderson with the Arizona Diamondbacks, J.T. Snow
with the San Francisco Giants and Greg Myers with the Oakland
Athletics.</TE>
<TE>   And finally: Dave Boling in the Tacoma News Tribune: "As the
Seahawks finally won a game after three defeats, [Shaun] Alexander
scored an NFL-record five touchdowns in the first half.</TE>
<TE>   "With one more in the game he would have tied the record of six in
a game jointly owned by Gale Sayers, Dub Jones and Ernie Nevers....
With his smooth and lengthy stride, Alexander looks as if he's
skating in open field."</TE>

<HD>5 Afghan Women Get Keys to Future at Cal State Northridge</HD>
<DH>Government Workers Are Honing Typing, English Skills to
Help Them Write Grant Proposals Back Home</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PATRICIA WARD BIEDERMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Typing has been a stumbling block for the visitors--five women who
hold government jobs in their native Afghanistan.</LD>
<LD>   They are spending two weeks at Cal State Northridge to improve
their computer and English-language skills and to learn how to write
grant proposals to get international aid for their country.</LD>
<LD>   Two days into the extended-learning program, which began Monday,
all five can send e-mail, with attachments. But the standard QWERTY
computer keyboard has been challenging, perhaps because their native
Dari, related to Farsi, is written right to left. So teachers at Cal
State Northridge are putting together a quickie typing course for the
women.</LD>
<TE>   "They're very, very eager," said Matthew Clements, who is teaching
them how to identify sources for grants and how to write and pitch
grant proposals. "They're very committed and very determined."</TE>
<TE>   Well-educated women between ages 22 and 36, they radiate the
pent-up ambition--for their country and especially its women--that
built during five years of Taliban rule. It has been less than a year
since the Taliban were defeated and Afghan women could shed their
burkas.</TE>
<TE>   Until then, these women watched with dismay as Afghan girls were
denied schooling, except on the sly, as well as access to medical
care and even ice cream.</TE>
<TE>   "People are very hopeful for the future," said Marzia Basel, who
was a judge before the Taliban came to power in 1996.</TE>
<TE>   Several women in the program, sponsored by the State Department,
sought refuge in Pakistan, but Basel stayed in the capital city of
Kabul.</TE>
<TE>   Unable to work as a judge, she taught English to boys ages 7 to
12. She also secretly taught girls and women, some in their 50s,
exposing them to such Western writers as Shakespeare, Bertrand
Russell and Victor Hugo. She avoided arrest by frequently moving her
clandestine classroom.</TE>
<TE>   The group is staying in Woodland Hills with their State Department
translator. They have visited a local supermarket, sampled American
fast food and shaken hands with numerous politicians. The Cal State
Northridge campus has 32,500 students, more than twice as many as the
University of Kabul, the only functional Afghan university, they
said.</TE>
<TE>   When the women met President Bush recently, most wore head scarves
as strict Muslim women usually do.</TE>
<TE>   After a few days on campus, most had abandoned their scarves, and
the youngest, Welda Roostai, 22, was wearing bell bottoms and fur
wrist cuffs. Roostai, who works for the Ministry of Women's Affairs,
has been e-mailing for years and hopes to become a pharmacist.</TE>
<TE>   Even when life in Afghanistan was bleakest, the women managed to
stay in touch with the rest of the world. Breshna Sadat, a lawyer who
works in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, hid a satellite dish on her
balcony during the Taliban regime.</TE>
<TE>   All English speakers, the women said many Western performers and
cultural figures are well known in Afghanistan, including Michael
Jackson, Jacqueline Kennedy and Madonna.</TE>
<TE>   In different ways, each of the women said that education changes
people's lives. Simin Bahmanyar, an administrator in Cal State
Northridge's College of Extended Learning who helped set up their
campus program, said that in her native Iran there is an adage:
"Educate a man and you've educated one person. Educate a woman and
you've educated a whole family."</TE>
<TE>   In class, Clements said, the women talk about the high mortality
rate for Afghan infants, the lack of decent health facilities and the
dearth of schools. But instead of dwelling on the past, they seem
determined to bring about change.</TE>
<TE>   Journalist Masooda Barekzaie said there is a new women's magazine
in Afghanistan called The Future.</TE>
<TE>   Married with three children, Jina Haidari works in the Ministry of
Women's Affairs. Her children were educated in Peshawar, Pakistan,
with considerable input from their mother.</TE>
<TE>   "My daughter is 9, and she's in seventh grade," Haidari said, with
obvious pride.</TE>
<TE>   The women tick off a list of things Afghanistan needs--physical
security for its people (there are still armed men on the streets of
Kabul, they said); medical care, especially for women; safe,
affordable housing; and, above all, education.</TE>
<TE>   "When people take up the pen, they put down the gun," Basel said.</TE>

<HD>Long Terms Possible in Gay Attacks</HD>
<DH>Crime: West Hollywood community is relieved at apparent
break in case. One victim may have suffered brain damage. Hate-crime
charges may be filed.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KENNETH REICH</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Police are considering hate-crime charges punishable by at least 18
years in prison for men arrested on suspicion of beating two gay men
with a baseball bat, police said Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   West Hollywood Sheriff's Capt. Lynda Castro said the suspects, who
are being investigated for possible affiliation with a street gang,
could face life in prison if one victim, actor Treve Broudy, has
suffered brain damage.</LD>
<LD>   City officials expressed relief at the apparent break in the case.</LD>
<TE>   Castro identified the suspects Wednesday as Larry Walker, 29, and
Vincent Dotsun, 18, both of South Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   A third possible suspect, arrested a month ago in connection with
a separate crime, was being interviewed and may be charged, Castro
said. He has not yet been identified.</TE>
<TE>   Castro said authorities are considering charges of assault with a
deadly weapon, attempted robbery and commission of a hate crime, in
connection with the Sept. 2 attack on Broudy and Edward Lett.</TE>
<TE>   No home addresses were released for Walker and Dotsun, and no more
information could be obtained.</TE>
<TE>   Arraignments in Superior Court in Beverly Hills could be as early
as today.</TE>
<TE>   Castro disclosed Wednesday that in addition to the provider of an
anonymous tip, deputies know two other people who offered tips in the
case and may be eligible for rewards totaling $91,000 if there are
convictions.</TE>
<TE>   Detectives are still investigating whether any of the men in
custody were involved in two other assaults against gay men that took
place last month in West Hollywood, where it is estimated that
one-third of the population is gay.</TE>
<TE>   "The ... station wants to extend its tremendous appreciation to
the hundreds of community volunteers, friends, city staff and members
of the media that helped to publicize this horrendous crime and
distribute the suspects' composites and reward information, which
ultimately helped lead to the arrest of these vicious and dangerous
suspects," read a statement issued by the West Hollywood Sheriff's
Station.</TE>
<TE>   In a city where the relationship between the sheriff's office and
the gay community used to be poor, Castro said she was pleased that
the community seemed to have gained confidence in the work of her law
enforcement personnel.</TE>
<TE>   "On Santa Monica Boulevard last night, people were cheering our
deputies and giving them thumbs up," she reported.</TE>
<TE>   "We've received more than 50 calls and e-mails thanking us for our
efforts, and even a basket with goodies," she added.</TE>
<TE>   Castro said she hoped the crimes will give rise to a better
community spirit and more willingness to promptly report such
offenses when they occur.</TE>
<TE>   Also speaking out was Paul Koretz, a former mayor of West
Hollywood and now Democratic assemblyman representing the area in the
Legislature.</TE>
<TE>   "The sheriff did great work and the community really came together
for this," Koretz said. "It was very gratifying that all the groups
each kicked in on the reward, which kept increasing ... and that we
were able to revive the community crime watch group."</TE>
<TE>   Broudy is still recovering from critical wounds suffered in the
attack. Castro said his doctor believes there is a possibility of
brain damage.</TE>

<LD>The California Supreme Court paved the way Wednesday for Robert Blake
to receive a bail hearing, six months after the actor was jailed for
allegedly shooting his wife to death.</LD>
<LD>   In a one-paragraph order, the high court instructed authorities to
argue before Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge Lloyd M. Nash
why Blake is not entitled to an immediate bail hearing.</LD>
<LD>   Blake, 69, has been held without bail in Men's Central Jail in
downtown Los Angeles since his April 18 arrest in the killing of
Bonny Lee Bakley, 44, near a Studio City restaurant.</LD>

<HD>Court Rules on Blake Bail Hearing</HD>
<DH>Crime: The actor, charged with the murder of his wife, has
been in prison since April.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The California Supreme Court paved the way Wednesday for Robert Blake
to receive a bail hearing, six months after the actor was jailed for
allegedly shooting his wife to death.</LD>
<LD>   In a one-paragraph order, the high court instructed authorities to
argue before Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge Lloyd M. Nash
why Blake is not entitled to an immediate bail hearing.</LD>
<LD>   Blake, 69, has been held without bail in Men's Central Jail in
downtown L.A. since his April 18 arrest in the killing of Bonny Lee
Bakley, 44, near a Studio City restaurant.</LD>
<TE>   The Supreme Court said authorities must show "the facts are
evident or the presumption great" that Blake killed Bakley while
lying in wait, a special circumstance that carries the death penalty.</TE>
<TE>   Although prosecutors have said they will not seek death in this
case, Blake has been denied bail because he is charged with capital
murder. Blake has pleaded not guilty to that charge as well as two
counts of soliciting murder and conspiracy.</TE>
<TE>   No hearing has been scheduled, but the Supreme Court set a Monday
deadline for authorities to file a response.</TE>
<TE>   Blake's attorney Harland W. Braun said the order is "clearly a
defeat for the district attorney." If the lying-in-wait allegation is
thrown out, Braun said, Blake would be entitled to post bail and be
released from jail.</TE>
<TE>   Spokeswoman Sandi Gibbons said the Los Angeles County district
attorney's office agrees that Blake should have a bail hearing, but
she said it should be held after evidence is presented at the
preliminary hearing, which is scheduled to begin Nov. 13 in Van Nuys.</TE>
<TE>   "If we had had a preliminary hearing in a timely fashion, this
would have been done a long time ago," she said.</TE>
<TE>   The order was signed by Chief Justice Ronald M. George and
associate justices Joyce L. Kennard, Kathryn M. Werdegar, Ming W.
Chin and Carlos Moreno.</TE>

<BD>From a Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>One woman died and three others were injured on a Pasadena sidewalk
Tuesday after a two-car collision caused a sport utility vehicle to
veer into a bus stop bench, police said.</LD>
<LD>   Veronica Calenzani, 29, was standing behind the bench on North
Lake Avenue at East Mountain Street about 11:40 a.m. when a
southbound Mazda sedan turning left into a driveway collided with a
northbound Chevrolet Suburban.</LD>
<LD>   The driver of the Suburban veered onto the sidewalk and knocked
over the bench, injuring the three people sitting on it. The SUV then
ran over Calenzani, who died at the scene, Police Lt. David Richter
said.</LD>
<TE>   The injured were taken to Huntington Memorial Hospital, where one
was treated and released. The conditions of the others weren't
available, but police said their injuries weren't life-threatening.</TE>
<TE>   Police remained at the scene throughout most of day but had not
determined fault. Traffic investigators questioned both drivers at
the scene.</TE>
<TE>   The driver of the Mazda, a 50-year-old woman, suffered minor cuts
and bruises, police said. The SUV driver, an 18-year-old man, was
unhurt.</TE>

<HD>Man Gunned Down in Buena Park; 2 Men, Teen Arrested After
Pursuit</HD>
<DH>Crime: Argument leads to killing of Compton businessman
near his home. Suspects lead police on 30-mile chase that ends in
crash. One is wounded by officers.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MAI TRAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Two men and a 17-year-old boy were arrested early Wednesday after
they shot a Compton business owner to death in a residential
neighborhood near his Buena Park home, police said.</LD>
<LD>   The suspects were arrested after a 30-mile, high-speed chase along
congested Orange County freeways. One of the suspects was shot in the
shoulder by police after the car in which the men were riding slammed
into a utility pole in Orange, said Buena Park Police Sgt. Rich Pena.</LD>
<LD>   Police said they are not sure what motivated the fatal shooting of
David Pete Montemayor, a 44-year-old father of three, but it could
have been robbery or even road rage.</LD>
<TE>   Montemayor, known to carry large sums of money, left his house
about 6:30 a.m. and was seen unlocking the doors to his family-owned
freight delivery company in Compton, police said.</TE>
<TE>   Investigators said they are unsure of what led Montemayor to the
Buena Park neighborhood where he was shot.</TE>
<TE>   Residents said they heard an argument after Montemayor's white
Ford Expedition and a blue Ford Bronco pulled onto Pinyon Street,
only a mile from where Montemayor lived. They told police that they
heard an argument and then saw Montemayor jump out of his car and
run.</TE>
<TE>   The suspects fired seven shots, striking him twice, police said.</TE>
<TE>   Neighbors said they found Montemayor's body in the street. His SUV
was abandoned nearby, its driver's door open and its engine running.</TE>
<TE>   Officers spotted the Bronco speeding south on the Santa Ana
Freeway, Pena said. Even in heavy morning traffic, police said the
Bronco reached speeds of 75 mph as it weaved along the 133 and 241
toll roads before cutting west on the Riverside Freeway and then
south on the Costa Mesa Freeway.</TE>
<TE>   The pursuit ended about 7:40 a.m. at Tustin Street and Lincoln
Avenue in Orange, when Buena Park police officers rammed the Bronco,
causing the driver to lose control and hit an electricity pole.</TE>
<TE>   Police opened fire, hitting one of the men in the shoulder, Pena
said. He declined to say what prompted officers to shoot.</TE>
<TE>   The Orange County district attorney's office and Orange police are
investigating the shooting.</TE>
<TE>   The injured suspect was taken to UCI Medical Center in Orange for
treatment and then booked into the city jail. The other man and the
17-year-old boy were arrested without incident.</TE>
<TE>   Police have not identified any of the suspects, though they said
two were parolees.</TE>
<TE>   Montemayor and his father owned Interfreight Transportation, a
15-year-old trucking and freight company that delivers dry goods,
clothes and electronics.</TE>
<TE>   "This doesn't make any sense," said the victim's brother, Darren
Montemayor, 37, who came to the scene of the shooting after seeing
reports on TV news. "He was always willing to drop anything to help
anyone. He doesn't deserve this. I can't believe this. I'm
devastated."</TE>
<TE>   Throughout the day, family and friends gathered at the Montemayor
home. Friends brought shopping bags of food, drinks and flowers. They
described Montemayor as a big man with a huge heart and a desire to
help others.</TE>
<TE>   They recalled that he'd spent the last weekend working at a
carnival booth at his church, St. Pius Catholic Church in Buena Park.
He loved to barbecue, attend car races in Pomona and take weekend
getaways in his 34-foot recreational vehicle--nicknamed
"Bertha"--with his wife, Susan, and their daughters, Amy, 11, and
Rachel, 9, and 7-year-old son Luke.</TE>
<TE>   Montemayor and his wife, a first-grade teacher's aide, had
recently celebrated their 13th wedding anniversary.</TE>
<TE>   "He wouldn't hurt anyone," said Kelly Beltran, a friend. "I don't
know why they have to hurt someone who loved to make others laugh."</TE>

<LD>Two men and a 17-year-old boy were arrested early Wednesday after
they shot a Compton business owner to death in a residential
neighborhood near his Buena Park home, police said.</LD>
<LD>   The suspects were arrested after a 30-mile, high-speed chase along
congested Orange County freeways. One of the suspects was shot in the
shoulder by police after the car in which the men were riding slammed
into a utility pole in Orange, said Buena Park Police Sgt. Rich Pena.</LD>
<LD>   Police said they are not sure what motivated the fatal shooting of
David Pete Montemayor, a 44-year-old father of three, but it could
have been robbery or even road rage.</LD>
<TE>   Montemayor, known to carry large sums of money, left his house
about 6:30 a.m. and was seen unlocking the doors to his family-owned
freight delivery company in Compton, police said.</TE>
<TE>   Investigators said they are unsure what led Montemayor to the
Buena Park neighborhood.</TE>
<TE>   Residents said they heard an argument after Montemayor's white
Ford Expedition and a blue Ford Bronco pulled onto Pinyon Street,
only a mile from where Montemayor lived. They told police that they
heard an argument and then saw Montemayor jump out of his car and
run.</TE>
<TE>   The suspects fired seven shots, striking him twice, police said.</TE>
<TE>   Neighbors said they found Montemayor's body in the street. His SUV
was abandoned nearby, its driver's door open and its engine running.</TE>
<TE>   Officers spotted the Bronco speeding south on the Santa Ana
Freeway, Pena said. Even in heavy morning traffic, police said the
Bronco reached speeds of 75 mph as it weaved along the 133 and 241
toll roads before cutting west on the Riverside Freeway and then
south on the Costa Mesa Freeway.</TE>
<TE>   The pursuit ended about 7:40 a.m. at Tustin Street and Lincoln
Avenue in Orange, when Buena Park police officers rammed the Bronco,
causing the driver to lose control and hit an electricity pole.</TE>
<TE>   Police opened fire, hitting one of the men in the shoulder, Pena
said. He declined to say what prompted officers to shoot.</TE>
<TE>   The Orange County district attorney's office and Orange police are
investigating the shooting.</TE>
<TE>   The injured suspect was taken to UCI Medical Center in Orange for
treatment and then booked into jail. The other man and the
17-year-old boy were arrested without incident. Police have not
identified any of the suspects, though they said two were parolees.</TE>
<TE>   Montemayor and his father owned Interfreight Transportation, a
15-year-old trucking and freight company that delivers dry goods,
clothes and electronics.</TE>
<TE>   "This doesn't make any sense," said the victim's brother, Darren
Montemayor, 37, who came to the scene of the shooting after seeing
reports on TV. "He was always willing to drop anything to help
anyone. He doesn't deserve this. I can't believe this. I'm
devastated."</TE>
<TE>   Throughout the day, family and friends gathered at the Montemayor
home. Friends brought shopping bags of food, drinks and flowers. They
described Montemayor as a big man with a huge heart and a desire to
help others.</TE>
<TE>   They recalled that he'd spent the last weekend working at a
carnival booth at his church, St. Pius Catholic Church in Buena Park.
He loved to barbecue, attend car races in Pomona and take weekend
getaways in his 34-foot recreational vehicle--nicknamed
"Bertha"--with his wife, Susan, and their daughters, Amy, 11, and
Rachel, 9, and 7-year-old son Luke.</TE>
<TE>   Montemayor and his wife, a first-grade teacher's aide, had
recently celebrated their 13th wedding anniversary.</TE>
<TE>   "He wouldn't hurt anyone," said friend Kelly Beltran. "I don't
know why they have to hurt someone who loved to make others laugh."</TE>

<HD>Counselors' Suspensions Reversed</HD>
<DH>Court: Ruling backs four Ventura College advisors whom the
chancellor accused of bias.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>AMANDA COVARRUBIAS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>An administrative law judge has overturned the suspensions of four
Ventura College counselors who had been accused by Chancellor Philip
Westin of discriminating against one of their peers.</LD>
<LD>   Judge Samuel Reyes ruled Tuesday that counselors Paula Munoz, Tim
Suel, Marian Carrasco and Beatriz Herrera did nothing wrong and
ordered the district to reimburse them for lost salary and benefits.</LD>
<LD>   The decision marks another defeat for Westin, who was placed on
paid administrative leave in July while the Ventura County Community
College District board of trustees investigates allegations that he
misspent district money.</LD>
<TE>   The district has spent more than $500,000 on legal claims,
lawsuits and grievances related to the counselors' suspensions.</TE>
<TE>   Westin suspended the four last year because he said they
discriminated against counselor Guadalupe Guillen, who was seeking
tenure. Herrera was suspended for two weeks, Carrasco for four
months, Suel for eight months and Munoz for one year.</TE>
<TE>   Reached at home Wednesday, Westin declined to comment.</TE>
<TE>   In his 34-page decision, Reyes wrote that the "district has not
established that respondents ... were motivated by any discriminatory
or improper considerations in their decision to deny her [Guillen]
tenure. The conduct of respondents ... as established at the hearing
did not involve hostility."</TE>
<TE>   Munoz, who has since taken a job at Antelope Valley College in
Lancaster, said the past year has been difficult.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know how I feel," she said. "I'm kind of numb. The
charges were trumped up and there was no truth to any of that. It's
been a very painful and anxiety-producing thing we've been going
through."</TE>
<TE>   She said the matter isn't over for her because she has a civil
lawsuit pending against the district in Ventura County Superior
Court, as well as a complaint with a different administrative law
judge in an effort to win back her previous job as director of the
Extended Opportunity Program and Services at Ventura College, a
position she held until Westin demoted her in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   "I feel like I was wronged and I need to return to Ventura
College," Munoz said.</TE>
<TE>   The counselors face a possibility the district will appeal Reyes'
decision. Acting Chancellor Jim Walker said Wednesday it will be up
to the trustees to decide if they want to appeal. They are expected
to review the matter Oct. 22.</TE>
<TE>   Westin suspended the counselors and secretary Laura Hilton after a
lengthy investigation into allegations they had discriminated against
Guillen. Hilton's suspension was overturned last month.</TE>
<TE>   The counselors appealed their suspension in a three-week trial
over the summer. Their attorneys argued they were punished for
expressing their opinions on Guillen's performance, and they
contended Ventura College President Larry Calderon was retaliating
against Munoz over a soured personal relationship. Calderon has
denied the allegation.</TE>
<TE>   "Anyone who stood up to Westin, he went after them," said Gregory
Ramirez, Munoz's attorney. "Westin had a campaign of terror at
Ventura College, and I hope it stops now--and that the trustees will
stop the hemorrhaging of public money paid to attorneys. Hopefully,
the district will let it go now."</TE>

<HD>U.S. Prosecutors Crack Down on HUD Fraud</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LOUIS SAHAGUN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>More than a dozen people have been charged recently for their roles
in attempts to defraud the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development, federal prosecutors said Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   The defendants are responsible for defrauding the agency of about
$8 million, U.S. Atty. Debra W. Yang said.</LD>
<LD>   In many cases, they allegedly profited from commissions for
preparing home loans that were later determined to have been
fraudulent. HUD suffered financial losses and the buyers' credit was
damaged, authorities said.</LD>
<TE>   The crackdown "is part of our ongoing effort to protect several
important programs designed to assist low- and moderate-income
families," said Thom Mrozek, a spokesman for the U.S. attorney's
office in Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   "Unfortunately, where there are large pools of money in government
programs, there are small numbers of people who try to exploit those
programs for their own benefit," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Charged Monday in separate wire fraud cases were Fernando Garcia,
43, of Rowland Heights and Reynalda Gonzalez, 44, of Mira Loma.
Matthew Dunne, 33, of Alhambra, who allegedly submitted loan
applications to HUD that included false W-2 forms and certifications,
was also charged Monday, Yang said. A fourth defendant, John Campos,
47, of Walnut, has admitted to acting as a notary and falsely
attesting that borrowers personally appeared before him to sign
$500,000 worth of fraudulent loan applications, Yang said.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities have moved against other groups in the last month,
including:</TE>
<TE>   * Tony Chisum Jr. and Terry Lee Rhodes, charged Sept. 26 with
conspiracy, making false statements, submitting false claims and
theft of government property.</TE>
<TE>   Chisum, 66, of Los Angeles, was president of the American
Philanthropy Assn., which operates homeless shelters, according to
federal prosecutors. Rhodes, 46, a transient who is a fugitive, was
an employee of the association.</TE>
<TE>   The indictment charges that at Chisum's direction, Rhodes created
phony attendance logs showing that certain individuals, who in fact
did not exist, had received shelter.</TE>
<TE>   * Jesse Olivas, 40, of Commerce, charged Sept. 26 with causing HUD
to lose more than $300,000 in a wire fraud scheme involving insurance
on fraudulent mortgage loans.</TE>
<TE>   * Joe Zamorano, 70; his son, Mario Zamorano, 38; and Patricia A.
Lopez, 55, each charged with buying HUD properties for resale to
"straw" buyers in a scheme allegedly involving fraudulent documents.</TE>
<TE>   * Ali Ghomizadeh, Massoud Ghomizadeh and Behrooz Katirai, charged
Sept. 11 with posing as real estate brokers to buy 46 HUD properties,
collecting $50,000 in broker commissions.</TE>

<HD>Medi-Cal Fraud at Lab Admitted</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID ROSENZWEIG</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The owners of a Glendale medical laboratory agreed Wednesday to plead
guilty to billing the Medi-Cal program for $19-million worth of bogus
blood tests.</LD>
<LD>   Luisa Gonzalez, 57, and Juan Carlos Ciraolo, 61, of Rancho Palos
Verdes, admitted running what authorities described as the biggest
fraud of its kind in the history of the state's medical assistance
program for the indigent.</LD>
<LD>   The Los Angeles Bio-Clinical Laboratory, operated by the pair in
Glendale during the mid-1990s, paid kickbacks to two medical clinics
for blood sample and fake doctor authorizations, prosecutors said.</LD>
<TE>   Assistant U.S. Atty. Lee Arian said the scheme was detected after
a Medi-Cal employee became suspicious because the laboratory's
billings soared suddenly from "very little to many millions of
dollars."</TE>
<TE>   Arian said Medi-Cal paid Gonzalez and Ciraolo $7 million of the
$19-million worth of fraudulent billings they submitted. The money
has not been recovered, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Under terms of their plea agreements, Gonzalez and Ciraolo face
possible sentences of 46 to 57 months in prison. They are scheduled
to plead to conspiracy and money-laundering charges Monday before
U.S. District Judge Ronald S.W. Lew.</TE>
<TE>   Ciraolo's attorney, William S. Pitman, called the deal a fair
compromise. If convicted at trial, Ciraolo would have faced a much
longer prison term. Gonzalez's lawyer could not be reached.</TE>
<TE>   Two co-defendants have cooperated with prosecutors and were
expected to testify against the lab operators.</TE>
<TE>   Last November, Dr. Luis Lombardi, 42, of Lawndale, owner of San
Gabriel Medical Clinic, pleaded guilty to federal charges stemming
from the fake billing scheme.</TE>
<TE>   Lombardi, who is awaiting sentencing and has been cooperating with
FBI and IRS investigators, was accused of providing the laboratory
with Medi-Cal patient names and forged physician authorizations for
expensive, comprehensive blood tests.</TE>
<TE>   The laboratory, which closed in 1997, was reimbursed by Medi-Cal
at an average rate of $550 a patient, the highest allowed for blood
tests.</TE>
<TE>   Also pleading guilty previously was Alfredo Morales, 38, of
Huntington Park, operator of La Guadalupana Medical Clinic. He too
has been cooperating while awaiting sentencing, Arian said.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors said La Guadalupana was used as a place to buy blood
from people off the street. Morales also provided falsified medical
records to the lab.</TE>
<TE>   Morales' partner at the clinic, Roberto Calderon, 41, of Los
Angeles, is a fugitive in the case.</TE>
<TE>   Also charged is Ciraolo's wife, Constanza, 50. She is scheduled to
go on trial later this month. Arian described her as a "lesser
player" in the alleged scam. He said she paid for the blood samples
and assisted in other criminal conduct.</TE>

<HD>Would-Be Kidnapper Sought in Long Beach</HD>
<DH>Manhunt: Parents are urged to be alert for man who has
approached children seven times.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOSE CARDENAS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Police urged parents to be alert and sought the public's help
Wednesday in finding a man who has tried seven times to kidnap
children in central Long Beach and Signal Hill.</LD>
<LD>   In the latest incident, the man pried open a locked chain-link
gate at a day-care center in the 2200 block of Olive Avenue and began
pulling a 4-year-old girl away, authorities said. But a staffer
retrieved the child and scared the man away.</LD>
<LD>   "Certainly we are concerned, and that's why we are reaching out to
the public," said Officer Greg Schirmer, a spokesman for the Long
Beach Police Department.</LD>
<TE>   About half a dozen Long Beach Unified School District schools in
the area began sending letters home two weeks ago informing parents
of the escalating incidents and asking them to be alert.</TE>
<TE>   On Wednesday, some were taking extra precautions.</TE>
<TE>   "Now I'm here early to pick [my children] up--doing the buddy
system," said Sonia Peterson. Her 10-year-old son attends Mary Butler
School, near where one of the incidents happened, and her 12-year-old
daughter attends Jefferson Leadership Academies. "I'm sitting here at
3:30. Before, they would walk home by themselves."</TE>
<TE>   Police and school officials urged parents and children to take the
often-heard advice: Know where your children are, make sure they walk
to school with buddies and know to run from a suspicious stranger.
For other safety information, officials suggested parents visit
www.missingkids.com.</TE>
<TE>   In one of the incidents, on Saturday the man succeeded in pulling
a boy off his bike and into his truck in the 2100 block of Spaulding
Court, Schirmer said. But the man released the youngster later
without harming him.</TE>
<TE>   Police believe the same man is involved in all the cases, based on
witnesses' description of him and his vehicle. All the incidents have
occurred within a few blocks and near several schools.</TE>
<TE>   The man is described as a Latino male between 30 and 35 years old,
authorities said. He is between 5 feet 4 and 5 feet 9, and weighs 140
to 165 pounds. Some witnesses said he had a mustache and some did
not.</TE>
<TE>   In the day-care center incident, the man was seen wearing
khaki-colored pants and a white T-shirt, according to authorities. In
another incident, he was wearing a short-sleeve blue uniform shirt
with a white rectangular name tag with navy blue writing on it, navy
blue pants and black dress shoes.</TE>
<TE>   His vehicle was described as a 1980s to 1990s white pickup
truck--possibly a Toyota--with miscellaneous items in the back.</TE>
<TE>   The attempted kidnappings began on Sept. 5, authorities said. The
children have ranged from 4 to 16 years old.</TE>
<TE>   * The first incident happened near 6th Street and Redondo Avenue,
where the man asked a young girl whether she wanted a ride. The girl
ran away.</TE>
<TE>   * On Sept. 12, near 23rd Street and Orange Avenue, the man exposed
himself to a 16-year-old girl and grabbed her by the arm, authorities
said. The girl got away.</TE>
<TE>   * On Sept. 19, near 20th Street and Chestnut Avenue, the man asked
three children where they were going. The children ran away.</TE>
<TE>   * Last Thursday, near 20th Street and Orange Avenue, the man
pulled his truck next to a boy on a bike and told him to stop, but
the boy pedaled away.</TE>
<TE>   * Also the morning of last Thursday, near 19th Street and Orange,
the man followed two children, who also ran away.</TE>
<TE>   Officers from the Long Beach and Signal Hill police departments,
along with school security, have been extra vigilant, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   "There's certainly a heightened awareness," said Richard Van Der
Laan, a spokesman for Long Beach Unified, adding that authorities
have sent two letters home. On Tuesday, principals also sent home the
composite sketch released by police.</TE>
<TE>   "We hope that having that on 5,000 refrigerators ... will have
15,000 pairs of eyes on the lookout for him," Van Der Laan said.</TE>
<TE>   Officials asked anyone with information to call (562) 570-6407.</TE>

<LD>A woman who police say stole people's identities and might be linked
to fraud schemes in Orange County and elsewhere in Southern
California was arrested by Los Angeles County sheriff's deputies on a
no-bail warrant for burglary, authorities said this week.</LD>
<LD>   Cynthia Ferguson, 44, of Lancaster was booked at the Twin Towers
Correctional Facility in Los Angeles, said Sgt. Jack Conklin of the
Brea Police Department, one of seven law enforcement agencies
investigating the case. Ferguson is scheduled to appear in court
Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   Authorities have been searching for Ferguson since her daughter
was arrested Sept. 22 in Yorba Linda.</LD>
<TE>   Monica Dawn Ferguson, 27, was arrested by a Brea police officer on
an outstanding warrant and on suspicion of forgery, counterfeit
checks, fake identification and falsely identifying herself to the
officer, authorities said. Brea police patrol Yorba Linda.</TE>
<TE>   The daughter, pulled over for driving with illegally tinted
windows, handed the officer a driver's license that had false
information, police said.</TE>
<TE>   A search of her car turned up evidence that might link the
mother-daughter team to identity-theft crimes that involve about 100
people and businesses in Los Angeles and in Orange, San Bernardino
and Riverside counties, police said.</TE>
<TE>   Monica Dawn Ferguson is being held at Orange County Jail in Santa
Ana on $75,000 bail. At the time of her arrest, the older Ferguson
also presented an ID with her photograph but with false information,
authorities said.</TE>
<TE>   According to police, Cynthia Ferguson was involved in a real
estate fraud scheme in Lancaster in which she applied for a loan
under another name, using counterfeit payroll stubs, fraudulent ID
and other fake documents.</TE>

<HD>Police Not Tickled by Radio Dare</HD>
<DH>Media: Charges may be filed against KPWR-FM employee who
allegedly solicited a teen boy to walk naked in Pacoima to win
concert tickets. The youth was arrested.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The arrest of a 17-year-old boy who allegedly walked naked around a
Pacoima intersection in a stunt to win concert tickets from radio
station KPWR-FM (106) may lead to charges against a station employee,
Los Angeles police said Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   Detectives are reviewing whether prosecutors would be likely to
charge anyone at the station, known as Power 106, with conspiracy and
soliciting a person to engage in a lewd act in public, police said.</LD>
<LD>   The teenager was arrested Tuesday on suspicion of intentional and
public exposure of one's private parts, said Officer Jack Richter, a
Los Angeles Police Department spokesman. The boy's name was not
released because of his age.</LD>
<TE>   "These stunts should be a matter of common sense and
responsibility by the participants and the station itself," Richter
said. "In this case, however, the behavior was not only audacious but
illegal."</TE>
<TE>   Police said the youth was encouraged by Joe Grande, a street
reporter for the Burbank station's morning radio personality Big Boy.
Grande is known for traveling around Los Angeles and getting people
to perform what the station calls a "dare of the day."</TE>
<TE>   According to police, Grande was at Laurel Canyon Boulevard and
Osborne Street during the morning rush hour Tuesday when he requested
people to "do something crazy" to win tickets to a concert by the
band P3.</TE>
<TE>   "While at the location, Grande announced on live air that he
wanted someone to remove all of their clothes and walk to all four
corners of the intersection naked," Richter said.</TE>
<TE>   The youth, who told station workers he was 18, offered to perform
the stunt, police said. Police said they got complaints of a man
exposing himself to a school bus and to families driving to school.</TE>
<TE>   Station officials did not return several calls seeking comment
Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   In August, two radio hosts were fired from WNEW-FM in New York
City after a Virginia couple were arrested for having sex in St.
Patrick's Cathedral. In that case, the radio personalities held a
contest for concert tickets that awarded points for having sex in
public places.</TE>

<LD>A father accused of violently shaking his now-comatose son and
fighting the boy's mother in court to keep the baby on life support
must stand trial on felony charges, a judge ruled Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   Superior Court Judge Robert Monarch found enough evidence to order
Moises Ibarra, 24, to stand trial for child abuse and corporal injury
to a child. Christopher Ibarra allegedly was shaken when he was 8
months old. The child, now a year old, is being kept alive with a
ventilator.</LD>

<HD>Speeding a Likely Factor in Road Deaths of 2 Men</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Excessive speed apparently played a role in separate crashes that
took the lives of two young men overnight Wednesday, although alcohol
may have contributed to one of the accidents, a sheriff's official
said. James Pitchford, 18, and Karim Fazelat, 21, both of Mission
Viejo, were killed hours apart in separate single-vehicle accidents,
said O.C. Sheriff's Department spokesman Jim Amormino.</LD>
<LD>   Pitchford was in a Subaru sport utility vehicle driven by Tyler
Ferguson, 18, who was arrested on suspicion of driving under the
influence following the rollover accident about 1 a.m. Wednesday in
Rancho Santa Margarita, Amormino said. The Subaru hit a curb and
overturned on Antonio Parkway at Tijeras Creek, throwing Pitchford
out and causing "massive trauma," Amormino said.</LD>
<LD>   Ferguson, who was also thrown from the vehicle, suffered minor
injuries, Amormino said.</LD>
<TE>   Fazelat was killed about 10:30 p.m. Tuesday when the Honda CRX he
was driving crashed into a utility pole. He was eastbound in the
28400 block of Los Alisos Boulevard in Mission Viejo, Amormino said,
and may have been going as fast as 100 mph.</TE>

<LD>A colleague received an invite from R &amp; R Studios, which is throwing
a "Halloween Botox Party" on Oct. 17--on the Westside, of course.
There'll be free drinks and hors d'oeuvres. And, yes, a plastic
surgeon will be on hand for the Halloween bash. For a price, he'll
supply the cosmetic masks.</LD>
<LD>   The new models are coming out! Former City Council aide Eric Rose
drove by Beverly Hills High the other day and noticed that the
California flag was flying upside down. An upside-down flag is, of
course, the international distress signal. Then again this is Beverly
Hills, so the "distress" could have been over something as simple as
all the BMWs and Mercedes-Benzes being delayed by the port shutdown.</LD>
<LD>   I predict the owners don't notice: Steve Durgin of L.A. came upon
a sign showing a pesky spelling problem that hadn't been overcome
(see photo).</LD>
<TE>   19th century hunks: The L.A. Police Department has long taken
pride in the physical fitness of its officers. In fact, the
department's historical society has a shot of an "LAPD Strong Men"
team that dates back more than a century (see photo). The big men,
with their big mustaches, participated in boxing, wrestling and
weight-lifting competitions.</TE>
<TE>   Then again ... : A much more recent snapshot by Fred Wallace of
L.A. is a reminder there is one sugar-laden snack that is associated
with cops everywhere, even in L.A.</TE>
<TE>   Annals of strange crimes: The police log of the Los Alamitos
News-Enterprise recorded a complaint from a resident who charged
"that someone she knew kept leaving insects on her car."</TE>
<TE>   Attention, screenwriters: Secession backers promise that if the
measure passes, a Valley film office will be formed separate from the
movie promotion agency in Los Angeles that is now under
investigation.</TE>
<TE>   If so, I hope the Valleyites do a better job of protecting the
region's image. No more insulting dialogue like this in "Pulp
Fiction":</TE>
<TE>   Hit man Samuel Jackson: "I'm calling my partner in Toluca Lake."</TE>
<TE>   Partner John Travolta: "Where's Toluca Lake?"</TE>
<TE>   Or that scene in "2 Days in the Valley," where a cop tells his
partner: "I know we're Valley detectives, so we're not all that
bright but ... "</TE>
<TE>   Or another scene in the same movie where a fistfight breaks out in
an apartment and a 60-ish resident next door tells his wife: "Maybe
that's how they make love in Tarzana."</TE>
<TE>   MiscelLAny: To your list of appropriately named weathercasters,
such as Johnny Mountain and Dallas Raines, Cliff Dektar of Studio
City suggests that you add a Weather Channel reporter--name of Ken
Weathers.</TE>

<LD>The Woodland Hills Rotary Club has received $15,000 from an anonymous
donor to pay the electric bill for a year at a cash-strapped
orphanage in Mexico supported by the club.</LD>
<LD>   The gift was among several offers of money, supplies and services
for Door of Faith, a residential facility for disabled and
able-bodied abandoned children in La Mision, Baja California.</LD>
<LD>   Offers of books, food and medical services have poured into the
club's Web site and voice mailbox since the Rotarians' support of the
orphanage was the subject of a Times article last month, said club

"too risky." They vowed to campaign vigorously to defeat the Nov. 5
ballot measures.</LD>
<LD>   "Sometimes, some of us don't walk in lock step," said county
Supervisor Gloria Molina, referring to the differences that have
frequently split local Latino leaders. "But on this issue, we are
united, we are strong, and we are going to work hard to defeat the
secession drive."</LD>
<TE>   Meanwhile, breakup advocates were cheered Wednesday by a Survey
USA poll conducted for KABC-TV Channel 7. The poll found that, among
likely voters, secession was winning in the Valley 57% to 38%, but
trailing citywide 43% to 53%. A poll in August by the same
organization showed secession winning in the Valley 57% to 40% and
losing citywide 40% to 56%. To win, secession must get a majority
vote in both the Valley and Los Angeles as a whole.</TE>
<TE>   Secession backers said the survey shows Valley secession gaining
among people likely to vote. Both in the Valley and citywide,
however, the changes from the August poll are within the survey's
margin of error, which is plus or minus 4 percentage points.</TE>
<TE>   Further, polling experts have questioned the reliability of the
Survey USA poll, which is conducted by computer rather than by live
interviewers. Survey USA did not release the questions it uses to
determine whether someone is a likely voter.</TE>
<TE>   Joining Molina at Wednesday's news conference were City Council
President Alex Padilla, City Atty. Rocky Delgadillo, Assemblyman Tony
Cardenas (D-Panorama City), state Sen. Richard Alarcon (D-Sylmar),
former Assembly Speaker Antonio Villaraigosa and San Fernando Mayor
Cindy Montanez.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the politicians had declared their opposition to secession
earlier. But some have been at odds for years over other issues.
Alarcon and Padilla, for example, once close allies (Padilla ran
Alarcon's 1998 state Senate campaign), had a falling out after
Alarcon decided not to back Padilla for the City Council.</TE>
<TE>   The rift has endured over the course of several local elections,
including last year's mayoral race. Padilla and Cardenas supported
James K. Hahn, while Alarcon endorsed Villaraigosa, who lost the
race.</TE>
<TE>   Even on secession, consensus was not always a given. Alarcon
initially expressed interest in running for mayor of a new Valley
city. The week after a Times poll showed voters citywide leaning
against the breakup proposals, he announced his opposition.</TE>
<TE>   "The bottom line is this: The proposal that has been presented to
voters is a proposal that has many flaws," Alarcon said Wednesday.
"Simply stated, it cannot guarantee that [a Valley city] would
provide the services that we have become accustomed to in Los
Angeles."</TE>
<TE>   Under terms set by the state commission that placed Valley and
Hollywood secession on the ballot, Los Angeles would continue
providing police, fire, sanitation and other services to the new
cities for at least one year. After that, new service contracts could
be negotiated.</TE>
<TE>   About 100 people from both camps in the secession battle, many of
them toting campaign posters, crowded close to hear the speakers.
Pro-secession hecklers broke in with cries of "Free the Valley!"
while a truck bearing a giant yellow "Free Hollywood" sign cruised
back and forth.</TE>
<TE>   Afterward, secessionists staged a news conference to accuse their
opponents of using "scare tactics."</TE>
<TE>   Geoffrey Garfield, campaign manager for the Hollywood Independence
Committee, said anti-secessionists have lied by suggesting a breakup
would threaten public safety. In a disaster, the new cities would be
protected by agreements between their fire departments and
neighboring departments, he said.</TE>
<TE>   In another development, Gene La Pietra announced that Rep. Loretta
Sanchez (D-Garden Grove) has endorsed his candidacy for Hollywood
city council. Sanchez's spokeswoman, Carrie Brooks, said Sanchez is
neutral on the question of secession itself. "She's endorsing him as
an individual," Brooks said.</TE>
<TE>   Also Wednesday, the board of the Los Angeles Headquarters Assn.,
representing 150 major corporations, voted unanimously to oppose
secession. Association President Sharon Kaplan said the breakup would
hurt L.A.'s standing as a world-class city.</TE>
<TE>   Secessionists have said downtown business groups such as the
association are determined to protect their interests at City Hall.
The breakup effort has been endorsed by several Valley-based business
organizations.</TE>

<LD>Sweeping aside some long-standing political differences and
rivalries, a broad coalition of Latino elected officials proclaimed
their unity Wednesday in the fight against secession.</LD>
<LD>   The officials gathered outside a Mission Hills fire station to
brand cityhood proposals for Hollywood and the San Fernando Valley
"too risky." They vowed to campaign vigorously to defeat the Nov. 5

of Sanchez, late City Councilman John Ferraro, Lt. Gov. Cruz
Bustamante, Gov. Gray Davis and others. The ad, created for La
Pietra's city council campaign, states that all of those named have
honored La Pietra for his work in the community.</TE>

<HD>Security Firm for John Wayne, Long Beach Airports Is
Accused</HD>
<DH>Probe: The Oakland company, hired to patrol control towers,
is alleged to have used unlicensed security guards, allowed guns
without permits.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STANLEY ALLISON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A company that provided security guards at John Wayne and Long Beach
airports following the Sept. 11 attacks faces revocation of its
operating license after a state investigation uncovered fraud and
misrepresentation by the Oakland firm, authorities said Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   Stealth Security Services Inc. used dozens of unlicensed security
guards, allowed some guards to carry firearms on the job without
permits and submitted phony bills to its clients, according to the
probe by the state Department of Consumer Affairs.</LD>
<LD>   Stealth provided security guards to patrol the air traffic control
towers at John Wayne and Long Beach airports under 90-day contracts
beginning in November 2001. The company also has a contract to guard
the Mill Valley Long Range Radar Site in Northern California.</LD>
<TE>   An administrative law judge ruled last month in favor of revoking
all licenses related to the firm; the ruling was announced this week.</TE>
<TE>   The consumer department's Bureau of Security and Investigative
Services, which regulates the private security industry in
California, also said that James Henry Williams and Archena D. Sharma
acted as fronts for Javed Aslam, whose license for another private
security business was facing revocation when Stealth Security was
created in January 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Aslam's license was revoked after he was convicted of a weapons
charge and other violations of rules governing private patrol
operators, authorities said.</TE>
<TE>   He negotiated contracts for Stealth Security and routinely
identified himself as the company's chief financial officer, bureau
investigators said.</TE>
<TE>   Sharma said the judge's ruling against Stealth "seems unjust and
unfair. There is not a single allegation against the company. All the
allegations they have are against Javed, and he has nothing to do
with the company."</TE>
<TE>   She said the ruling has been appealed but a hearing date had not
been set.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Motorists usually curse their bad luck when a parking enforcement
officer suddenly pulls up from behind.</LD>
<LD>   But a 61-year-old Los Feliz man can thank heaven that Los Angeles
Parking Enforcement Officer Barbara Hartsfield came upon his idled
truck Monday in the middle of a busy street in Silver Lake.</LD>
<LD>   Hartsfield found the man unconscious and slumped over in the front
seat of his Ford pickup, an apparent heart-attack victim. The
quick-thinking officer determined that the man had no pulse and was
not breathing. She performed cardiopulmonary resuscitation until
paramedics arrived to whisk the man to a hospital where he is
recovering and expected to survive.</LD>
<TE>   Now Hartsfield, 46, is being dubbed a hero for her life-saving
performance.</TE>
<TE>   "If she wasn't there, this guy would probably be dead," said Los
Angeles Fire Department Engineer Ed Gallagher, who was among the
emergency crew that came to the scene Monday morning to treat the
ailing motorist.</TE>
<TE>   "She went way beyond the call of duty," he said.</TE>
<TE>   As she walked through the offices of her parking enforcement
headquarters in Hollywood on Wednesday, Hartsfield was congratulated
by colleagues and praised by supervisors.</TE>
<TE>   "We call her our hero," said Los Angeles Parking Enforcement Capt.
Andrea Fernandez, Hartsfield's boss.</TE>
<TE>   Firefighters said the man, whose name was withheld pending family
notification, is being treated at the intensive-care unit of Queen of
Angels-Hollywood Presbyterian Medical Center. But he had gained
enough strength to call firefighters Wednesday to thank them for
their help, Gallagher said.</TE>
<TE>   Hartsfield, a five-year department veteran and a former 911
operator, learned that the man survived only on Wednesday. "I think
it's wonderful that he is OK," she said.</TE>
<TE>   The rescue began when Hartsfield was called to relieve a colleague
who was directing traffic around an automobile accident on Hyperion
Avenue near Myra Avenue in Silver Lake. Hartsfield went to the
traffic scene, but then told her colleague she needed to take a quick
bathroom break. As she left the scene, Hartsfield came upon a Ford
pickup stopped in the middle of the road, straddling two lanes.</TE>
<TE>   She walked up to the truck and found the man slumped behind the
wheel, his lips blue and his eyes half open. Hartsfield, a mother of
two, said she learned CPR to be prepared for emergencies involving
her children. She didn't expect to use the skill for work, and it's
not required for the job.</TE>
<TE>   Hartsfield laid the man flat on the truck seat and began
performing CPR, using her hand-held radio to call for help. A doctor
who happened to be passing by assisted Hartsfield briefly until
paramedics arrived. Once help arrived, Hartsfield said, she began
directing traffic around the scene.</TE>
<TE>   There was more good news for the heart attack victim: He was not
cited for illegally parking in a traffic lane.</TE>
<TE>   "Contrary to popular belief, we don't just come upon a
double-parked car and whip out our ticket book," Hartsfield said with
a laugh.</TE>

<HD>Garden Grove Schools Honored</HD>
<DH>Education: The district is awarded $125,000 in college
scholarships as a model of academic achievement.</DH>

<LD>They didn't win the grand prize, but runner-up status still brought
Garden Grove Unified School District $125,000 in college scholarships
and recognition as a model of academic achievement during ceremonies
Wednesday in Washington, D.C.</LD>
<LD>   The central Orange County district was among more than 100 urban
school districts nationwide that were scrutinized this year as part
of a new education award sponsored by the Broad Foundation. The Los
Angeles-based organization promotes quality education in
disadvantaged urban schools.</LD>
<LD>   Five finalists, including Garden Grove Unified School District,
shared $1 million in scholarship money Wednesday. The funds will be
distributed next spring to current high school seniors in the winning
districts.</LD>
<TE>   Houston Independent School District won first place and $500,000
for, among other things, having the smallest achievement gaps among
ethnic and socio-economic groups. Long Beach Unified School District,
Atlanta Public Schools and Boston Public Schools, the three other
finalists, each will receive $125,000.</TE>
<TE>   "This is for everyone" in the district, Garden Grove school board
president Bob Harden said by telephone Wednesday from Capitol Hill,
where the awards were presented. "From those who get the rooms ready
before classes, to the teachers and administrators.... This validates
the work they do."</TE>
<TE>   Harden flew to Washington earlier this week with fellow trustee
Terry Cantrell, district Supt. Laura Schwalm and Dave Brown,
president of the local teachers union.</TE>
<TE>   When they return, Harden said, "we'll have lots of pats on the
back to distribute and then we'll tell everyone to get to work and do
even better next year."</TE>
<TE>   The Broad Prize for Urban Education, unveiled in March, has no
formal application process. In its inaugural year, 108 large urban
school districts of 35,000 or more students with high poverty and
multiethnic populations were eligible.</TE>
<TE>   A review board looked at several factors, including test scores,
attendance, dropout rates and achievement gaps among ethnic and
socio-economic groups.</TE>
<TE>   Nearly 60% of Garden Grove Unified's 50,000 students qualify for
free or reduced-price lunches. About half still are learning English.</TE>
<TE>   The Broad award's review board credited Garden Grove's system of
clearly defined academic goals and close monitoring of students'
academic progress for its success.</TE>
<TE>   Officials must still determine the selection process for students
who will receive college scholarships in the winning districts.</TE>
<TE>   The money, $10,000 for those who enroll in four-year colleges and
$2,000 for those who choose two-year programs, will be awarded in the
spring.</TE>

<LD>The City Council will require a full environmental impact report on a
proposed car processing plant near the Ormond Beach wetlands.</LD>
<LD>   The Oxnard council voted unanimously Tuesday for an extensive
study after developers agreed to follow a recommendation by city
planners for a thorough review.</LD>
<LD>   Pacific Vehicle Processors wants to convert a 38-acre vacant
parcel south of Hueneme Road into a plant for preparing imported
vehicles before they are shipped to dealers. But a group of activists
has opposed the plant, saying it is too close to the rare birds and
plants that make Ormond Beach their home.</LD>
<TE>   Company officials have maintained that the area they want to use
is not part of the wetlands and wouldn't harm sensitive areas, but
agreed to an environmental report in an attempt to avoid a court
battle, they said.</TE>
<TE>   Jim Kilpatrick, vice president of marketing and development for
Pacific Vehicle Processors, said the report should take at least six
months.</TE>
<TE>   The company had hoped to open its facility by next spring.</TE>

<HD>Police Quell Harbor Scuffle</HD>
<DH>Labor: Picketing dockworkers confront deckhands when they
try to untie a ship to leave Port of Hueneme. No one is arrested.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SANDRA MURILLO and GREGORY W. GRIGGS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The four-day lockout at the Port of Hueneme turned ugly Wednesday
when angry picketers tried to prevent a banana-carrying ship from
leaving the dock, provoking a confrontation that brought out police
in riot gear.</LD>
<LD>   The commotion erupted about 2:30 p.m. when picketers tried to stop
deckhands on the Del Monte ship from drawing its moorings as the
vessel prepared to leave for Ensenada, Mexico. Dimitrio Kozcov, a
deckhand, was surrounded by angry dockworkers who shouted and shoved
him.</LD>
<LD>   "They scared me," said Kozcov of Latvia. "They kept saying 'This
is not your job!' "</LD>
<TE>   About 40 Oxnard and Port Hueneme officers, outfitted in riot gear
and armed with batons and pepper spray, responded and quickly broke
up the confrontation. No arrests were made.</TE>
<TE>   To picketers like Siupolu Belaustegui, the deckhands' actions were
a sign of disrespect to longshoremen involved in a labor dispute with
the association representing shippers. Releasing a ship's moorings is
a longshoreman's job, she said.</TE>
<TE>   "We didn't think they were going to pull that on us," said the
Oxnard resident. "That's why we put a stop to it. No one's going to
come in and do our job."</TE>
<TE>   The flare-up occurred as union negotiators were bargaining with
Pacific Maritime Assn. representatives in San Francisco over what to
do about perishable cargo stalled at ports, said Janet Ritza,
secretary-treasurer of International Longshore and Warehouse Union
Local 46, which represents area dockworkers. Pacific Maritime
represents the shippers.</TE>
<TE>   Ritza said workers picketing near the port entrance noticed that
the crew of the banana ship violated union work rules while preparing
the ship for departure.</TE>
<TE>   "They sent the ship's crew out to undo the line. We consider that
our job," Ritza said. "So we tried to stop them."</TE>
<TE>   Officials at Local 46 later conferred with their leaders in San
Francisco, she said, and learned they could not legally prevent the
ship from leaving.</TE>
<TE>   Police also had no authority to keep the ship dockside. But a Del
Monte official told the ship's captain to remain at port and the
commotion quickly died down.</TE>
<TE>   "It's Del Monte's call. The company decided that it's not worth
it. They didn't want anybody to get hurt," said Will Berg, marketing
director of the Oxnard Harbor District. "They did the cool-headed
thing and decided to leave the ship there."</TE>
<TE>   The only other commercial ship tied up at the port, the Cefalonia,
is carrying liquid fertilizer for use by local growers on strawberry
fields and in orange and lemon orchards.</TE>
<TE>   A refrigerated LauritzenCool ship carrying Bonita bananas,
anchored outside the port earlier this week, left Tuesday afternoon
to unload its cargo at a port in Ensenada.</TE>
<TE>   Berg estimates the harbor district will lose about $22,000 in fees
that would have come from that ship unloading in Ventura County. Some
of that money would have come from the subsequent loading of about
60,000 boxes of Sunkist Growers citrus to be shipped to Japan.</TE>
<TE>   On Wednesday, a Wallenius Wilhelmsen vessel hauling 1,459 import
vehicles remained anchored near the port. A second car carrier loaded
with about 1,500 Mitsubishis, originally expected to arrive offshore
Wednesday, was stalled in Tacoma, Wash.</TE>
<TE>   Union officials said they would continue 24-hour picketing but
hoped there would be no further confrontations with police.</TE>
<TE>   About 90 minutes after the initial incident, the deckhands were
back on their ship and picketers resumed chanting "Teamsters!" and
"America No. 1."</TE>
<TE>   "Welcome to America!" yelled one longshoreman.</TE>
<TE>   "Yeah, welcome to America," shouted another, "but you can't take
our jobs!"</TE>
<TE>   When most of the dockworkers had left the area near the boat,
Kozcov descended from his ship to ask a favor.</TE>
<TE>   Crew members wanted to come down to eat and walk around. But they
wanted to be sure the picketers wouldn't attack them.</TE>

<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>SACRAMENTO</LD>
<LD>   The debate over issues--real, substantive issues--finally has been
joined in the race for governor. Credit the natural rhythm of
government, rather than the candidates.</LD>
<LD>   This is a significant event because, after all, issues are what
voters continually tell pollsters they want candidates to talk about.
Deep down, of course, we all know it's smash-mouth politics that grab
the voters' attention and are the most effective strategy for
candidates.</LD>
<TE>   So bill-signing month-- September--is a blessing. A governor is
forced to approve or reject hundreds of measures. He must venture
beyond mere rhetoric and actually act.</TE>
<TE>   We've now seen what it means to have a Gov. Gray Davis rather than
a Gov. Bill Simon passing judgment on legislation. More than clashes
of ideas, it's about real-world competing interests. Not just debate,
but deeds.</TE>
<TE>   The bill-signing exercise was politicized, but that's built into
democracy. Davis was pressured by the public's will--his Democratic
Party's will--to take certain actions. More than he normally does,
Davis acted like a Democrat to shore up his soft liberal base while
running for reelection.</TE>
<TE>   Simon, in turn, reacted like a conservative Republican trying to
solidify his party's hard core.</TE>
<TE>   Here are major examples of how they differed on key bills--and why
it matters who's governor:</TE>
<TE>   Family Leave</TE>
<TE>   Davis made California the first state to enact comprehensive paid
family leave.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't want parents to have to choose between being a good
parent and a good employee," he said at the bill signing.</TE>
<TE>   The governor's action reaped national attention and no doubt
bolstered his support among women.</TE>
<TE>   The program will be funded by employee payroll deductions.</TE>
<TE>   "It amounts to a tax on all employees," Simon said, declaring he
would have vetoed the bill. "People are taxed enough."</TE>
<TE>   Complaining about an anti-business climate in California, Simon
said that, if elected, he'll work to repeal two other bills
previously signed by Davis: increasing workers' compensation benefits
and resurrecting the eight-hour workday.</TE>
<TE>   Global Warming</TE>
<TE>   Davis also made California the first state to fight global warming
by requiring reduced tailpipe emissions of greenhouse gases.</TE>
<TE>   "We are going to set an example for the rest of the country," the
governor said, reaffirming his environmental credentials. "I would
prefer to have Washington take the lead, but ... "</TE>
<TE>   Last spring, Simon called the bill "social engineering." Later, he
agreed that "reducing global warming--if indeed there is such a thing
as global warming--is always a good idea." Most recently, he has
said, "I'd leave it up to the scientists."</TE>
<TE>   Stem Cell Research</TE>
<TE>   Davis signed a bill positioning California at the forefront of
stem cell research, thus challenging President Bush's attempts to
limit this controversial field.</TE>
<TE>   "It could potentially save millions of lives," Davis said. "I am
determined to keep California at the forefront of medical research
and scientific innovation."</TE>
<TE>   Simon would have vetoed the bill. "I'm comfortable with President
Bush's position."</TE>
<TE>   Abortion</TE>
<TE>   Davis signed a bill protecting abortion rights in California even
if the Supreme Court ever overturns its landmark 1973 Roe vs. Wade
decision.</TE>
<TE>   "Our current Supreme Court is narrowly divided," Davis said.
"California is not going to sit idly by and wait for that gavel to
drop."</TE>
<TE>   Simon would have vetoed the bill, he explained, because it is
"duplicative" of current law.</TE>
<TE>   That may be. But Davis scored by reminding pro-choice women of the
difference between the two candidates on this litmus-test issue.</TE>
<TE>   Farm Workers</TE>
<TE>   After long agonizing, Davis signed the nation's first bill giving
farm workers the right to mandatory mediation in deadlocked contract
negotiations with growers.</TE>
<TE>   Davis was caught between the farm workers union, Latino
politicians and organized labor on one side--and, on the other,
wealthy growers who had contributed heavily to his campaign. He went
with his party base and avoided a potential revolt.</TE>
<TE>   Simon would have vetoed the bill. "It will put our state's farmers
at a competitive disadvantage to every other state and, indeed, to
foreign competition."</TE>
<TE>   Guns</TE>
<TE>   Davis signed legislation allowing firearms manufacturers to be
held liable for their products' harm, particularly when a gun maker
pitches a weapon to thugs. One ad promoted a gun as resistant to
fingerprints.</TE>
<TE>   Simon would have vetoed the bill. "We have enough gun laws."</TE>
<TE>   Unfortunately, voters usually have to fight through the
candidates' mudslinging to find where they stand on issues.</TE>
<TE>   Ethics, experience and ideas all matter. But a politician's policy
decisions matter most.</TE>

<HD>Schoolgirls' Deaths Lead to Charges</HD>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A woman whose car struck and killed two schoolgirls in March when she
hit the gas pedal instead of the brake was charged with misdemeanor
counts of vehicular manslaughter Wednesday by the Anaheim city
attorney's office.</LD>
<LD>   A judge issued a warrant for the arrest of Maria Juarez, 50, who
could not be found at her last known address in Anaheim.</LD>
<LD>   The accident occurred March 12 in a congested pickup and drop-off
zone in front of Centralia Elementary School as children left for the
day. Juarez told police that she had picked up her two grandchildren
and was leaving when she mistakenly stepped on the gas pedal.</LD>
<TE>   Second-grader Bianca Perez, 7, of Buena Park and first-grader
Nidia "Liz" Curiel, 6, of Anaheim, died after being pinned against a
wall by the car.</TE>
<TE>   The Orange County district attorney's office announced in April
that it would not pursue felony charges against Juarez because she
was not grossly negligent. Key factors that would have prompted
felony charges are speeding or driving under the influence.</TE>
<TE>   The criminal prosecution division of the Anaheim city attorney's
office now has jurisdiction.</TE>
<TE>   John Nicoletti, a city spokesman, said e the charges were filed
now because a California Highway Patrol officer, who will be a key
witness, was unable to testify earlier because of injuries he
suffered during the summer.</TE>
<TE>   Juarez was also charged with driving on a sidewalk, unsafe
movement and unsafe speed. If convicted, she faces a maximum of two
years in jail.</TE>

<HD>More Areas of Forest to Be Closed</HD>
<DH>Danger: Federal authorities cite severe fire and drought
conditions in shutdown of most of the San Bernardino wilderness.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SCOTT GOLD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Federal authorities today will announce plans to close vast stretches
of the San Bernardino National Forest, the second time in a week that
severe fire and drought conditions have forced officials to shut down
public wilderness in Southern California.</LD>
<LD>   Mike Dietrich, the U.S. Forest Service fire chief in the San
Bernardino forest, said Tuesday evening that the closures will go
into effect at noon Friday and could last a month or more. Parts of
the 671,686-acre national forest were last closed in 1999; the entire
forest was shut down in 1972, Dietrich said.</LD>
<LD>   Forestry officials are also considering similar closures in the
Cleveland National Forest north of the Mexican border and east of San
Diego, authorities confirmed, though decisions there are not expected
until next week.</LD>
<TE>   Dietrich said the action in the San Bernardino will be less severe
than the broad closure implemented in the neighboring Angeles
National Forest last week, though details were still being worked out
late Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   Several popular tourism spots in the San Bernardino forest, such
as the Big Bear Discovery Center, will remain open because the threat
of fire is low and firetrucks have easy access on good roads, he
said. And some developed, permanent sites in the forest, including
Boy Scout camps, will remain open. Residents will continue to have
access to their homes.</TE>
<TE>   But the vast majority of the forest, which begins at the eastern
border of the Angeles National Forest and folds in the communities
surrounding Big Bear, Lake Arrowhead and the San Gorgonio Pass before
spilling into the desert, will be closed, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Hiking, horseback riding and off-road vehicle use will be
prohibited, Dietrich said. Campfires have already been banned in the
entire park. Towns will remain open.</TE>
<TE>   The San Bernardino National Forest is one of the most popular
recreational spots in the state, said Forest Service spokesman Matt
Mathes, and is visited by more than 10 million people each year.</TE>
<TE>   "We do not like to close the forest to public use unless
conditions are extreme," Dietrich said. "We are stepping up to the
plate and taking the appropriate action because of fire danger."</TE>
<TE>   In Idyllwild, high above the San Gorgonio Pass, Atipahato Lodge
owner Frank Gaynor said the closure will be difficult for businesses,
from art galleries to restaurants, that rely in part on recreational
visitors. But, he said, the closure "seems to make some sense under
the current conditions. The last thing we need is a fire on top of
the drought."</TE>
<TE>   News of the closure drew similarly mixed reactions at Lake
Arrowhead resort, where the lake is at historic lows with 500 docks
sitting on dirt.</TE>
<TE>   Richard Teacher, owner of the 10-room Storybook Inn bordering
national forest land, said, "Not to be able to stroll through the
forest will be a sad thing for our guests.</TE>
<TE>   "But it's the right thing to do," he added. "We have so many dead
trees that bark beetles ravaged because of the drought that the fire
danger is very high."</TE>
<TE>   On Sept. 24, as the so-called Williams fire was churning through
more than 35,000 acres above the San Gabriel and Pomona valleys, the
Forest Service decided to close the Angeles forest for the first time
since 1993.</TE>
<TE>   It remained off-limits to hikers, mountain bikers, campers and
others Wednesday, and main roads within its boundaries, including
Angeles Forest and Angeles Crest highways, were open for through
traffic only.</TE>
<TE>   There were no significant, active fires in the San Bernardino
forest Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   A moisture-laden weather system that hovered off the coast for
much of the last week helped firefighters wrestle the Williams fire
into submission, and gloomy weather over much of Southern California
seemed to suggest that the threat of wildfires had faded with the end
of summer.</TE>
<TE>   To the contrary, Dietrich said. The weather provided what forestry
officials believe is a brief respite.</TE>
<TE>   This weekend, a high-pressure system is expected to arrive,
driving temperatures in some areas back into the 90s, officials said,
and possibly creating dangerous Santa Ana wind conditions that could
cause wildfires to spread quickly.</TE>
<TE>   Even without those winds, Dietrich said, the Forest Service
expects that it will be "right back in the same ballpark" because of
the weather. "There was a little bit of a breather," Dietrich said.
"But the amount of precipitation we had was inconsequential to the
overall conditions. The conditions we are in don't change overnight."</TE>
<TE>   Mathes said federal officials are especially wary of fire
conditions in the San Bernardino because it is one of half a dozen
national forests that abut major urban areas. Most national forests,
such as those in Idaho and Wyoming, are in remote areas.</TE>
<TE>   Officials have said they do not plan to reopen the Angeles until
there is rainfall sufficient to mark the end of fire season.</TE>

<HD>Boy, 15, Is Held in Contempt of Court After Refusing to
Testify in Slaying of Transient</HD>
<DH>Trial: The inmate balks at being a witness against
defendant in the beating death of a homeless man in Ventura. He is
expected to be called to the stand again.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TRACY WILSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A Ventura County judge held a 15-year-old boy in contempt of court
Wednesday for refusing to testify against a teen accused of
participating in the seaside slaying of a homeless man.</LD>
<LD>   Rocky Mattley took the stand but refused to be a witness against
19-year-old Robert Coffman, who is charged with murder and attempted
murder in the June 30, 2001, beating of a transient and an unrelated
stabbing of a teen a day later.</LD>
<LD>   Prosecutors wanted to question Mattley about the stabbing and
offered him immunity. But he refused to say a word.</LD>
<TE>   "Mr. Mattley refused to even speak his name in court," Deputy
Dist. Atty. Stacy Ratner said. "He will definitely be prosecuted for
contempt."</TE>
<TE>   The beating and stabbing occurred during a roughly 24-hour period
near Surfers Point in Ventura.</TE>
<TE>   Mattley faced no charges in connection with the assault but was
charged and later convicted of second-degree murder for his role in
the slaying of James Clark, 58.</TE>
<TE>   He is serving time at a California Youth Authority facility.</TE>
<TE>   On Wednesday, Ratner said prosecutors decided to try Mattley in
Juvenile Court after he agreed to testify against Coffman--an
agreement Ratner contends the boy is now violating.</TE>
<TE>   If tried as an adult, Mattley could have faced a possible life
prison sentence.</TE>
<TE>   As a juvenile, he can be held only until age 25.</TE>
<TE>   Mattley gave no explanation for his refusal to testify. But
inmates often refuse to testify in criminal cases for fear of being
known behind bars as someone who cooperates with law enforcement.</TE>
<TE>   Mattley is expected to be recalled to the stand this week. If he
refuses to testify, he could again be held in contempt and
potentially face additional charges.</TE>
<TE>   In other developments Wednesday, three girls testified about
conversations they had with or overhead among Coffman, Mattley and
two other boys charged in the fatal beating of Clark.</TE>
<TE>   Glancing nervously at the defendant, Stephanie Gonzalez, 14,
testified that two days after the slaying she heard the boys talking
about a fight with a man at the beach.</TE>
<TE>   She said Coffman told her he had stomped and kicked the man in the
face. She said he also talked about stabbing a teen.</TE>
<TE>   "Do you remember Robert telling you he thought he killed both
people?" Ratner asked.</TE>
<TE>   "Yes," Gonzalez whispered.</TE>
<TE>   "Was he bragging about it or just saying it sort of
matter-of-fact?" Ratner asked.</TE>
<TE>   "I guess he was just sort of proud of what he did," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Testimony is scheduled to resume today.</TE>

<HD>Controller Candidate Minds His Opponent's Business</HD>
<DH>Politics: State senator questions stock sale by former EBay
executive, who defends his record.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAN MORAIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>State Sen. Tom McClintock, a Republican running for state controller,
joined the ranks of career politicians attacking their
entrepreneurial opponents Wednesday, questioning Democrat Steve
Westly's dealings when he was an executive at EBay Inc.</LD>
<LD>   Westly, who quit EBay almost two years ago to run for controller,
scrambled to respond, convened a news conference to defend his former
company and to call McClintock "confused" and "clueless about how the
stock market works."</LD>
<LD>   McClintock is a fiscal conservative who often advocates a
free-market approach to governance. But Wednesday, the Thousand Oaks
Republican contended that Westly sold 270,000 shares of EBay stock
and made about $14 million in October 2000, shortly before the stock
price briefly fell.</LD>
<TE>   "I don't think it is a good time to be running on a record like
this," McClintock said, seated beside a chart that he contends
depicts facts showing how "Inside trader Steve Westly pockets
millions."</TE>
<TE>   "The public is entitled to a full airing of this issue," he said.
"They have a right to know all the details on this matter."</TE>
<TE>   The stock's slippage in 2000 resulted in no lawsuits by
shareholders; the federal Securities and Exchange Commission took no
action against the company. And unlike many high-tech firms, EBay has
not retreated on its generally upbeat predictions about its future.
It also has shown consistent growth.</TE>
<TE>   In leveling the accusations against Westly, McClintock seemed to
be taking a cue from Democratic Gov. Gray Davis, who has repeatedly
attacked his Republican challenger, Bill Simon Jr., over Simon's
business acumen and ethics. Other candidates have used a similar
tactic in this year of corporate scandals, declining stock prices and
shrinking 401(k) retirement funds.</TE>
<TE>   Treasurer Phil Angelides noted that in the official voter handbook
for the spring primary, his Republican challenger, Greg Conlon,
called himself a "certified public accountant for over 30 years with
Arthur Andersen." With Arthur Andersen dissolved amid the Enron
scandal, Conlon altered his self-description. Conlon describes
himself in the general election voter handbook as a "senior partner
at a CPA firm."</TE>
<TE>   Political consultants had assumed that business ethics would be an
issue that resonates with voters worried about their retirement funds
and angry about corporate bankruptcies. Republican consultant Kevin
Spillane said that while the public anger may not be as great as
expected, corporate scandals have tarnished the image of
entrepreneurs-turned-politicians.</TE>
<TE>   At his news conference, McClintock focused on events at EBay
during the fall of 2000, and particularly its stewardship of the
Butterfields auction house, a part of the company that Westly oversaw
for a time.</TE>
<TE>   Two weeks after Westly exercised stock options, EBay laid off
Butterfields workers and Ebay's stock fell.</TE>
<TE>   By early 2001, however, as high-tech stocks continued to fall,
EBay regained much of its value. It now sells at about $53 a share,
roughly its price when Westly sold his 270,000 shares.</TE>
<TE>   Westly, who hastily convened Wednesday's news conference to
respond to McClintock, noted that he sold the stock in a previously
announced and programmed sale. He also said that he did not oversee
the Butterfields operation in 2000, and that Butterfields represented
a small portion of EBay's overall business.</TE>
<TE>   Additionally, Westly said there was nothing untoward about his
departure from the firm. He had announced he was leaving EBay about
two months before the sale to mount his campaign.</TE>
<TE>   "Tom McClintock doesn't have a handle on his facts," said Westly,
contending that McClintock, a career politician, "has never worked a
day in his life in business."</TE>
<TE>   Westly is tapping his personal wealth to help finance his
campaign, and is expected to heavily outspend McClintock.</TE>
<TE>   Nonetheless, some Republicans believe McClintock has the best
chance of winning a statewide office, perhaps depriving Democrats of
a sweep of so-called down-ballot offices.</TE>
<TE>   McClintock's name is relatively well-known among voters because he
has run for controller before and has gained attention with a variety
of his past stands. McClintock would not say whether he would use his
allegations against Westly in ads.</TE>
<TE>   Part of that will depend on whether he has the money to mount a
media campaign against Westly. McClintock is expected to report
having less than $500,000 next week when he releases his latest
campaign finance statement.</TE>
<TE>   The cost of airing television ads statewide for a week is about
$1.5 million.</TE>

<HD>UFW Used Brinkmanship to Win 2 Laws</HD>
<DH>Labor: The union's legislative team cornered Gov. Davis
into signing mediation bills.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GREGG JONES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>As the clock ticked toward midnight, Arturo Rodriguez, president of
the United Farm Workers union, faced a momentous decision.</LD>
<LD>   It was Aug. 31, barely three hours from the time when the
California Legislature was required by law to adjourn, and the UFW
had a historic offer on the table. After trying for months to block
union efforts to rewrite the state's farm labor law, Gov. Gray Davis
was offering to sign a bill giving farm workers mandatory mediation,
a powerful new weapon when contract negotiations with growers
stall--but only for three years and 35 cases.</LD>
<LD>   Rodriguez agonized over his decision for a minute or two, then
spoke into his cellular phone to union advisor Richie Ross at the
Capitol: Call the governor's bluff and send him a bill for five years
and 75 cases--a bigger program that stood a better chance of ending
decades of poverty and failed contract negotiations for farm workers,
UFW leaders reasoned.</LD>
<TE>   "It was a gamble, there's no doubt about that," said Rodriguez,
son-in-law of the late UFW founder Cesar Chavez. "Cesar taught us
that sometimes you need to take risks to make progress. If he were
here, I think he would have done the same thing."</TE>
<TE>   The gamble paid off this week when Davis decided to sign a pair of
UFW bills into law--a decision union officials and their political
allies are hailing. The legislation gives the United Farm Workers of
America--and a handful of other unions representing agricultural
workers--the right to request a form of binding arbitration in 75
cases over the next five years.</TE>
<TE>   Growers say the governor's action will cripple California's
$27-billion agriculture industry.</TE>
<TE>   In signing the bills, Davis turned aside political pressure from
the growers, who have contributed endorsements and hundreds of
thousands of dollars to his reelection campaign. Some of those
growers reacted to the governor's decision by withdrawing their
endorsements this week.</TE>
<TE>   Davis acknowledged growers' concerns Wednesday on San Francisco's
KGO-AM (810), noting that "farmers are under a lot of pressure from
international competition" and "consolidation in the supermarkets."
But, he added, "very few people on the planet Earth live under more
difficult circumstances than farm workers, and if this helps allow
them to convert some of their elections into contracts, I think it's
a good thing."</TE>
<TE>   How the UFW managed to pull off such a triumph after years of
declining membership and failed negotiations is a story of
legislative skill, political brinkmanship and 1960s-style street
tactics, say union leaders, lobbyists, labor experts and other
analysts.</TE>
<TE>   "This is truly a historic piece of legislation," said Kent Wong,
director of the Center for Labor Research and Education at UCLA.
"It's a major breakthrough for the farm workers."</TE>
<TE>   UFW leaders are quick to share the credit with everyone from
Senate leader John Burton (D-San Francisco), who carried the original
bill and subsequent versions through the Legislature, to Davis, who
ultimately dropped his opposition to the UFW legislation and engaged
the union in serious negotiations, union leaders say.</TE>
<TE>   Latino Clout</TE>
<TE>   The success is also testament to the growing clout of Latino
legislators in Sacramento, according to UFW leaders and others
involved in the battle.</TE>
<TE>   Monday's victory was the culmination of three years of efforts to
position the UFW as a political force in Sacramento, said Ross, a
longtime UFW advisor and political strategist.</TE>
<TE>   As the UFW tells the story, it was an effort that began with the
union's successful attempt in 2000 to block and then rewrite a bill
making Chavez's birthday a state holiday. And it built on Davis'
August 2001 signature on a bill aimed at preventing labor contractors
from cheating farm workers out of wages--the first time in more than
20 years the UFW had gotten a piece of its legislation signed into
law, labor experts say.</TE>
<TE>   The seeds of Monday's success were planted in December, as UFW
leaders were discussing possible bills for the 2002 Legislature. Ross
received a call from Richard Rios, a labor consultant for Assemblyman
Herb Wesson (D-Culver City). Rios had worked on a Wesson bill the
previous year that gave backstretch workers at racetracks the right
of binding arbitration in contract disputes with employers.</TE>
<TE>   Rios "calls me up and says, 'Mr. Ross, have you ever thought about
binding arbitration' [for farm workers facing stalled negotiations
with growers]? As soon as he said it, I knew that was it," Ross said.</TE>
<TE>   In January, the UFW leaders and Ross drafted a bill inspired by
Wesson's approach, but the UFW quickly ran into its first roadblock
when Wesson--just taking over as Assembly speaker--wouldn't agree to
carry it, Ross said.</TE>
<TE>   With the deadline for filing bills less than a week away, the UFW
went to Burton. The Senate leader, a longtime friend of labor, agreed
to lead the UFW charge by carrying the bill.</TE>
<TE>   Burton was certain to deliver the Senate, so the UFW turned its
attention to the Assembly and lined up 41 coauthors.</TE>
<TE>   "I knew ultimately the governor would go to the speaker [Wesson]
and say, 'Listen, I need a favor, I'm going to do this bill next
year, I need you to put the brakes on it,' " Ross said. "I understood
that once they got us to the Assembly, the play would be to slow it
down, negotiate, we'll do it next year.... I wanted to head that
off."</TE>
<TE>   The growers quickly found themselves playing catch-up.</TE>
<TE>   "They had 41 coauthors in the Assembly, I think, before we even
found out about the bill," said Mike Webb, a lobbyist for the Western
Growers Assn., which represents 3,500 California and Arizona farmers.</TE>
<TE>   By June, Ross said, he had secured a crucial commitment from
Wesson: When the inevitable call from the governor came, the Assembly
speaker would tell Davis he couldn't help him on the UFW bill.</TE>
<TE>   If the governor was poised to call the speaker, Wesson beat him to
the punch. He says he phoned Davis to tell him he was supporting the
UFW legislation.</TE>
<TE>   For the UFW and the governor, the endgame began Aug. 5, when an
amended version of the binding arbitration bill won final approval in
the Assembly and returned to the Senate.</TE>
<TE>   Contentious Meeting</TE>
<TE>   With the Senate poised to take up the revised legislation, senior
Davis aides laid out their concerns in a tense meeting with UFW
leaders. Davis' Cabinet secretary, Susan Kennedy, accused the union
of trying to paint the governor into an election-season corner, Ross
said.</TE>
<TE>   Kennedy says she "definitely made it clear that this office wasn't
happy about being jammed. I said friends don't jam each other. Why
didn't you come to us?"</TE>
<TE>   Ross quickly fired back, boasting to reporters that he would
organize a political shunning of Davis if he vetoed the UFW
legislation and spreading the word that Dolores Huerta, the union's
fiery 72-year-old co-founder, was going to fast until Davis signed
the bill.</TE>
<TE>   The warning Ross hoped to convey: Davis faced a public relations
disaster, especially among Latinos, if he spurned the farm workers.</TE>
<TE>   UFW leaders and Ross now say they knew by August that they would
have to compromise to have any chance of getting a bill that Davis
would sign. That process began around the third week of August, when
a key Davis labor advisor, Marty Morgenstern, began facilitating a
series of meetings between UFW leaders and growers.</TE>
<TE>   "My goal always was to get something that works [and] that
accommodates both sides"--not dictate the governor's desires, said
Morgenstern, a veteran labor leader and mediator.</TE>
<TE>   But the meetings failed to find any common ground between the
union and growers.</TE>
<TE>   "We made it clear that binding arbitration in whatever form was
unacceptable," Webb said. "We listened to the UFW and what their
problems were with the system. The UFW outright rejected everything
we had to offer."</TE>
<TE>   UFW officials say the growers wanted to do little more than create
a blue ribbon panel to study the reasons farm workers were failing to
win contracts from growers.</TE>
<TE>   In an effort to break the impasse, Morgenstern sought ideas from
Bill Gould, a Stanford University labor law professor and former
chairman of the National Labor Relations Board under President
Clinton. Gould referred Morgenstern to a book he had written, which
discussed various forms of mandatory mediation adopted by several
Canadian provinces.</TE>
<TE>   Morgenstern laid out some of the Canadian solutions during his
meetings with UFW leaders and growers. Ross took notes.</TE>
<TE>   Ross rewrote the UFW bill and began touting the new version as the
"Morgenstern proposal"--a useful exaggeration that suggested Davis'
imprimatur, Ross concedes with a chuckle.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the UFW was turning up the pressure on Davis. On Aug.
15, waving the red-and-black Aztec eagle flags that evoked powerful
memories of Chavez, Rodriguez and Huerta began leading a 160-mile
march through the Central Valley to Sacramento.</TE>
<TE>   "We knew we had a shot now," Ross said. "There was genuine
dialogue between us and Marty Morgenstern. We needed to create a
focal point."</TE>
<TE>   The march ended Aug. 25 with a raucous Capitol rally that
attracted several thousand people.</TE>
<TE>   Key Conversation</TE>
<TE>   The following day, a perturbed Davis phoned Rodriguez.</TE>
<TE>   I don't know why you're doing this to me, Davis said at one point
to Rodriguez, according to UFW officials familiar with the
conversation.</TE>
<TE>   "Artie was giving it right back to him," said Ross, who was in the
room at the time. "On three occasions, I heard Artie say: 'Governor,
I don't tell Dolores Huerta what she can and can't do.' "</TE>
<TE>   Kennedy, who was in the room with Davis, said the governor told
Rodriguez--a longtime friend--that he was disappointed the UFW hadn't
sought his personal input on such an important piece of legislation.
In the governor's eyes, the UFW had "waited to the end of the
legislative session and jammed him with a PR campaign," Kennedy said.</TE>
<TE>   At the end of the hourlong call, Davis asked Rodriguez to call
Morgenstern.</TE>
<TE>   Negotiations on the second UFW initiative--the mandatory mediation
idea--got underway, with Davis aides proposing to limit the remedy to
two years and 25 cases. The union asked for seven years, but said the
number of cases was negotiable, Ross said.</TE>
<TE>   Webb says growers weren't aware these negotiations were taking
place.</TE>
<TE>   On Saturday, Aug. 31, the final day of the legislative session,
Barry Goode, the governor's legal advisor, made a new offer: 35 cases
over three years, but applying only to companies involved in
long-running disputes with workers, a proposal that Ross dismissed
out of hand.</TE>
<TE>   About 8 p.m., Goode returned with a final offer: Davis would sign
a bill that would include all growers, with caps of three years and
35 cases, according to Ross.</TE>
<TE>   Ross phoned Rodriguez, who was at the UFW annual convention in
Fresno.</TE>
<TE>   "Artie, I don't even know if I can get a bill and do this. I only
have three hours and I have to go through both houses of the
Legislature," Ross recalls telling Rodriguez.</TE>
<TE>   Rodriguez decided to gamble: Five and 75, he told Ross.</TE>
<TE>   Shortly afterward, Ross and Goode gathered with legislative staff
in a Capitol office to finalize the language of the revised UFW bill.</TE>
<TE>   The moment came to fill in the length of the program and number of
cases, and Ross sprang his surprise on the governor's negotiator:
"Gentlemen, it's five and 75," Ross announced.</TE>
<TE>   Goode walked out of the room.</TE>
<TE>   An hour before midnight, the revised bill cleared the Legislature.</TE>
<TE>   Throughout September, Davis kept UFW leaders guessing as to
whether they had overreached.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, on Monday, with two strokes of the governor's pen, the
UFW bill that was finalized in the closing minutes of the Legislature
and a companion measure approved a night earlier became the new
framework for resolving conflicts between California's largest
industry and its workers.</TE>
<TE>   Growers are bitter about the outcome.</TE>
<TE>   "To have this significant a change to the [1975 farm labor law]
unilaterally pushed on us in the waning moments of the legislative
session, with absolutely no opportunity for agricultural input, is
the wrong way to go about making public policy in California," said
Webb, the lobbyist for growers.</TE>
<TE>   Morgenstern says he hopes that growers "will recognize the
governor took the best option available to him" and will give the
program a chance.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a modest approach," Morgenstern said, a characterization
that growers dispute. "Take a relatively small number of cases and
see if we can bring labor and management together where they want to
be, which is working together."</TE>

<HD>U.S. Denies Blame for Die-Off of Salmon</HD>
<DH>Ecology: Officials say it's too early to tell if shifting
more Klamath River water to farms was cause.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ERIC BAILEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>Bush administration officials scrambled Wednesday to blunt
accusations that the federal government caused last week's die-off of
more than 20,000 salmon in the Klamath River by diverting too much
water to farmers.</LD>
<LD>   The administration's top wildlife official said it remains too
early to tell if low flow levels created on the river by a new
federal water plan helped spread a condition known as gill rot
through the fall run of chinook salmon.</LD>
<LD>   "I think it's premature to rush to judgment," said Steve Williams,
U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service director. "We really want to base any
decision we make now or in the future on solid science."</LD>
<TE>   But fishermen, environmentalists, California wildlife officials
and Indian tribes that depend on chinook continued to argue that the
diversion of water to upstream Klamath Basin farmers artificially
starved the river of the water needed to keep the salmon run robust.</TE>
<TE>   "They're trying to blame anyone but themselves for what is clearly
a water policy problem," said Glen Spain of the Pacific Coast
Federation of Fishermen's Assns. "They have created a permanent,
institutionalized drought on the lower river."</TE>
<TE>   The jousting came as Spain joined Rep. Mike Thompson (D-Eureka)
and tribal leaders in dumping 500 pounds of dead salmon at the
doorstep of the U.S. Department of Interior in Washington.</TE>
<TE>   Thompson said the salmon "represent thousands of jobs, millions of
dollars and priceless resources that are being destroyed due to the
administration's failures in the lower Klamath Basin."</TE>
<TE>   He also called on Interior Secretary Gale Norton to permanently
increase the Klamath flows as well as purchase and fallow some
agricultural acreage to ease demands on water that he said would be
better left in dry years for fish and other wildlife.</TE>
<TE>   Infections Take Toll</TE>
<TE>   State and federal officials estimate that about half of the adult
chinook expected to reach upstream spawning grounds and hatcheries
this fall succumbed to a combination of protozoa and bacterial
infections. Though not an endangered species, the chinook are prized
by the commercial salmon fishing industry.</TE>
<TE>   Biologists at the California Department of Fish and Game say they
suspect that higher water temperatures and low flows caused the fish
to delay their migration upstream, creating crowded conditions that
helped to spread the disease quickly.</TE>
<TE>   Facing a catastrophe, the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation--the federal
agency that manages water projects in the West--agreed to
dramatically boost river flows late last week.</TE>
<TE>   Williams said during a telephone news conference Wednesday that
the salmon die-off had already begun to ebb by the time the pulse of
water reached the chinook about three days after its release. The
plan is to again ratchet back flows after two weeks, federal
officials said. Although the growing season is over for most farmers,
there are concerns about lowering the level of Klamath Lake, where
two species of endangered sucker fish live.</TE>
<TE>   California wildlife officials, who said the die-off is the worst
in three decades, expressed concern that a cutback in the flows could
prove disastrous for the surviving chinook and other impending salmon
runs, most notably that of the fragile coho, a federally protected
species threatened by extinction.</TE>
<TE>   'We Are Uneasy'</TE>
<TE>   Paul Wertz, a California Fish and Game spokesman, said the worry
now is that the surviving chinook could be coaxed upstream, only to
be left in dwindling water when the river flows are again cut. The
coho, meanwhile, could face a river with far less water even than
last year, when one of the worst droughts on record occurred, Wertz
said. "We are uneasy about this."</TE>
<TE>   He and other California officials also expressed surprise that
their counterparts at the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service seemed
reluctant to pin the cause of the die-off on the lower flows.</TE>
<TE>   "I would suspect that the usual bio-politics are at play," Wertz
said.</TE>
<TE>   Many foes of Bush's Klamath water plan suggest that the
administration's primary motive in favoring farmers over fish this
year is to cement the allegiance of the rural constituency that has
strongly backed the president.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, farmers in the Klamath Basin saw water deliveries
dramatically curtailed so more water could help the fish. The
cutbacks caused severe economic turmoil in some farm towns and
prompted angry protests.</TE>
<TE>   Vowing to fix the problem, Bush officials pushed through a plan
that this year gave farmers a full allotment despite a relatively dry
winter. Tribes and environmentalists predicted that the more meager
flows down the Klamath--about 25% less than last year--would cause
problems.</TE>
<TE>   "The frustrating thing for us is we predicted it," said Dave
Hillemeier, fisheries program manager for the Yurok tribe. "You put
way too many fish in a small fishbowl, add poor water quality and
you're going to have dead fish."</TE>
<TE>   The die-off, which began nearly two weeks ago, seemed to prove
them prophetic. The water temperature in some stretches of the river
reached 72 degrees, well into the lethal range for salmon, state
officials said. The gill rot disease, which causes salmon to
essentially suffocate, was aggravated by the warm water and spread
more easily by the crowded conditions, they added.</TE>
<TE>   Williams of U.S. Fish and Wildlife said it's possible that too
much is being made of the higher temperatures and lower water in the
river, adding that in 1991, 1992 and 1994 average daily flows were
actually lower than this year.</TE>
<TE>   "It's too early to speculate what we're going to find," he said,
noting that a team of biologists from a host of state and federal
agencies is now making the Klamath one of the nation's most
scrutinized waterways.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not buying into any particular theory now," he added. "I'm
trying to keep an open mind."</TE>
<TE>   Sue Ellen Wooldridge, an Interior Department deputy director, said
the administration has not lost confidence in its water plan for the
Klamath and is taking a wait-and-see attitude.</TE>
<TE>   Asked repeatedly by reporters whether the extra water that went to
farmers this year had put the fish in jeopardy, Wooldridge suggested
that she did not understand the question.</TE>
<TE>   Finally she said "the common sense answer" would be that, had
there been "no agricultural deliveries," there would have been more
water for the fish. She added that the administration now faces a
"Catch 22" because efforts to help the salmon by releasing water
downstream could pose problems for the endangered sucker fish in
Upper Klamath Lake.</TE>
<TE>   Farmers Like Policy</TE>
<TE>   Dan Keppen of the Klamath Water Users Assn. said he was pleased by
the Bush administration's stance. He also voiced a common concern
among Klamath Basin farmers--that they are bearing the brunt of blame
for problems with endangered fish to the exclusion of others, among
them loggers and farms closer to the coast.</TE>
<TE>   Federal officials had predicted a run of about 130,000 chinook on
the Klamath this fall. Biologists figured that more than half of
those fish would be caught by tribal fishermen and sport anglers.
Such a run, though among the biggest in years, would be dwarfed by
those of decades past, when nearly 900,000 chinook and coho salmon
would crowd the Klamath and its tributaries.</TE>

<HD>One Son Offered Fighting Chance</HD>
<DH>Disease: The Bennett siblings have Sanfilippo syndrome, but
only Tommy could benefit from stem-cell surgery.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHARLES ORNSTEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>DURHAM, N.C.</DL>
<LD>John and Alicia Bennett learned Wednesday that only one of their two
sons--both ill with a rare genetic disease--is a good candidate for
an experimental transplant that could save his life.</LD>
<LD>   The Northern California couple accepted the news with the same
resilience with which they have handled the devastating toll of the
disease on all three of their youngsters, who range in age from 3 to
6. Children with the condition usually die by their teens, after
severe brain and organ damage.</LD>
<LD>   Experts at Duke University Medical Center told the Bennetts that
their 4-year-old son, Hunter, shows too much irreversible damage
caused by Sanfilippo syndrome, in which the body lacks an enzyme
needed to break down sugar molecules. As a result, he stands to gain
little from an experimental stem-cell transplant using umbilical-cord
blood in an effort to replace the enzyme.</LD>
<TE>   However, prospects for improvement are much better if Hunter's
younger brother, Tommy, receives a transplant, doctors said. Tommy,
who recently turned 3, most likely will be scheduled for the
procedure next month after minor surgery to remove his tonsils and
adenoids, and a nine day regimen of chemotherapy.</TE>
<TE>   Their older sister, Ciara, 6, also has Sanfilippo, but her
condition is very advanced, and she was not considered for a
transplant.</TE>
<TE>   The parents, who live in Amador County near Sacramento, did not
protest the medical decision for just one transplant. But that
doesn't mean it was easy to digest.</TE>
<TE>   "I still emotionally want to get the procedure done on Hunter, but
you have to do the right thing intellectually," said John Bennett, a
truck driver. "Nobody wants to say I'm going to let my kid die."</TE>
<TE>   Tommy and Hunter have been undergoing tests at Duke for the last
two weeks, measuring their brain activity, development skills and
other bodily functions.</TE>
<TE>   On Wednesday, the Bennetts met with Dr. Joanne Kurtzberg, director
of Duke's pediatric stem-cell transplant program. Tommy's transplant,
the doctor told them, may reverse some of his symptoms, but he will
never be normal--or even close. He should be able to communicate, and
his life expectancy may be extended.</TE>
<TE>   "I know these are really hard decisions," Kurtzberg told the
Bennetts. "My best guess is that he would still need somebody to take
care of him."</TE>
<TE>   John Bennett said he believes Tommy can still learn new things,
unlike Hunter and Ciara. "If five years down the road, he's playing
piano and designing rocket trajectories, then we're having a good
time, but we're not expecting that," the father told Kurtzberg during
a meeting attended by a Times reporter.</TE>
<TE>   Bennett continued, "We're going into this realistically. We don't
expect ... "</TE>
<TE>   "Miracles," his wife said, finishing his sentence.</TE>
<TE>   As for Hunter, Kurtzberg said, the magnetic resonance imaging scan
showed major damage and extensive loss of brain tissue. The boy's
developmental tests showed that he was functioning on a
12-month-old's level, with little comprehension or communication
skills. By comparison, Tommy has the skills of a 20- to 22-month-old,
except for his inability to speak.</TE>
<TE>   "I worry that the transplant is not going to help [Hunter], and it
would be very difficult for him to get through it," Kurtzberg said.</TE>
<TE>   About 10% of children with similar diseases die as a result of
complications from the transplant, but the risks are higher for
children whose illnesses are more advanced.</TE>
<TE>   During the last two weeks of testing, the Bennetts have gradually
accepted Hunter's fate, although they had been hopeful for months
that he would be eligible. Short of a transplant, there is no other
medical treatment for Sanfilippo, which affects about one in 70,000
children.</TE>
<TE>   "Hunter has a good year left, give or take, of being aware of his
surroundings, and I just don't want to take it away," his father
said.</TE>
<TE>   Ciara has accompanied her brothers to Duke, although she generally
sits in a stroller, sleeping or staring into space--having lost
nearly all her ability to comprehend what's going on around her.
Ciara was diagnosed with the disease in February 2001, and the boys'
cases were confirmed a year later.</TE>
<TE>   Sanfilippo children develop somewhat normally during their first
couple of years, learning to walk, talk and eat on their own. But as
the disease progresses, the children lose those skills.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier this summer, the Bennetts' insurer, Kaiser Permanente,
refused to cover the transplants at Duke, saying they haven't been
proven effective and citing the risk of death during the procedure.
An independent panel of medical experts hired by state regulators
concurred with Kaiser's decision.</TE>
<TE>   But the Bennetts kept the pressure on, contacting the media and
attempting to raise $1.5 million through fund-raising dinners and
raffles. For a time, the family worried that they would have to make
a Sophie's choice--deciding which son should get the transplant--if
they were not able to raise enough money for both.</TE>
<TE>   In early September, Kaiser agreed to donate $1 million to Duke for
research on Sanfilippo with the understanding that it could be used
to care for the boys. That sum is more than enough to care for Tommy,
doctors say.</TE>
<TE>   Though she is hopeful, Kurtzberg said there isn't enough real-life
experience to know for sure whether the transplants will reverse or
even slow the disease. Her team has performed the procedure on only
four other children with Sanfilippo, although it has a longer track
record of success with children who have related diseases.</TE>
<TE>   On Tuesday, a team of doctors, psychologists, physical therapists,
social workers, speech and hearing experts at the University of North
Carolina examined Tommy and Hunter in the final stage of determining
their eligibility for transplants.</TE>
<TE>   Dr. Maria Luisa Escolar, a developmental pediatrician at UNC's
Center for the Study of Development and Learning, said doctors should
assist families in deciding about transplants, but not make the
decision for them.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think I have a right to do that," said Escolar, who works
with Kurtzberg. "It is more of a mutual decision. I believe that
every family is different, every child is different, and you can't be
too opinionated about doing one thing or another."</TE>
<TE>   The decision to proceed with an experimental transplant comes with
plenty of risks, said medical ethicist Arthur Caplan of the
University of Pennsylvania. Even when parents are told of the
drawbacks, they tend to focus only on the prospects for success.</TE>
<TE>   "It's more like signing up for a trip into the unknown, like an
astronaut, than it is like signing up for a therapy that you would
normally expect to get from a doctor," Caplan said.</TE>
<TE>   Although the Bennetts maintained their composure during nearly all
of Wednesday's meeting about their children's fate, their emotions
broke through once. Both parents cried when John Bennett asked
Kurtzberg whether the couple should consider donating the bodies of
Ciara and Hunter for research after they die. The doctor said yes,
but then Alicia Bennett cut off the discussion. "I don't want to
think about it," she said wiping away a tear.</TE>
<TE>   To maintain their strength, the couple said they try to enjoy the
time they have with the children and to separate emotion from reason.</TE>
<TE>   "There's still only one right thing to do, and that's what's best
for them," John Bennett said.</TE>
<TE>   The Bennetts have created an online journal describing daily
developments and posting photographs. The Web address is</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>So Bill Bratton wins the beauty contest.</LD>
<LD>   A surprise?</LD>
<LD>   Not really. Mayor Jim Hahn was hot for someone from outside the
Los Angeles Police Department to air out Parker Center. That meant
Oxnard Chief Art Lopez, who spent the bulk of his career in L.A.
blue, had about as good a chance as Trini Lopez.</LD>
<TE>   It was always a contest between ex-NYPD boss Bratton and his pal,
ex-Philadelphia commissioner John Timoney. I don't know whether Slim
Jim flipped a coin, or decided on the basis of which guy could name
three Los Angeles neighborhoods without crib notes.</TE>
<TE>   Speaking of which, a colleague from back East dropped me a line to
say they must not have told Bratton that Beverly Hills isn't in the
LAPD's jurisdiction. And that's just one of several things that
concern me.</TE>
<TE>   Bratton's got a nose for the camera, and New York City wasn't big
enough to contain the egos of both Bratton and former Mayor Rudy
Giuliani. When they banged heads over who deserved the curtain calls
for New York's declining crime rate, it was like planets colliding.</TE>
<TE>   Jim Hahn cuts a slimmer profile, one that's invisible to most of
us who live in L.A., and I'm worried that Bratton will work him like
a punching bag.</TE>
<TE>   It was Bratton, after all, who wrote a book about, guess who, in
which he compared his arrival as New York's police commissioner to
Babe Ruth at the plate, pointing to where his home run would land.</TE>
<TE>   In other words, like most New Yorkers, Bratton is half Hollywood.
And, hey, as a columnist who's always on the make for material, I
like a brash, bold personality. Lord knows that cup does not runneth
over at City Hall.</TE>
<TE>   But as a former New Yorker myself, I'd like to take this
opportunity to give Bratton a few things to chew on.</TE>
<TE>   Before you unpack your bags and close a deal on the house in
Brentwood, Billy Boy, be aware that we aren't looking for another
star. We already have enough of those.</TE>
<TE>   We've also got gangs surging, bullets flying, children dying and a
demoralized Police Department that's down a thousand cops. So we're
not looking for someone who's going to hang around for a couple of
years, see how many movie stars he can meet and how many headlines he
can score, and then run home when he doesn't get his way.</TE>
<TE>   Giuliani won the war of egos in New York, and Bratton, who changes
jobs as often as he changes wives, bailed out a mere 27 months after
filching the following Winston Churchill quote at his swearing-in:</TE>
<TE>   "We will fight for every house in the city. We will fight for
every street. We will fight for every borough. And we will win."</TE>
<TE>   That kind of maudlin drama might have dazzled New York City's
tabloid press corps, but what worked back East won't necessarily fly
in Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   For starters, part of the LAPD's problem is that it has acted like
an occupying army at times, so a declaration of war might not be the
best way to convert the troops.</TE>
<TE>   With only 9,000 cops, compared to New York's 40,000, the only way
to "win the war" is to stop calling it a war, and to get entire
communities to trust and respect the Police Department enough to work
hand-in-hand with cops.</TE>
<TE>   I personally like Bratton's unapologetic philosophy of going after
the little things like broken windows before a young thug graduates
to more serious mayhem. But not if it turns into a blitzkrieg, as it
often did in New York, and leads to a flood of citizen complaints
that cost taxpayers millions of dollars.</TE>
<TE>   You can't expect to get anywhere, one LAPD cop told me, by "riding
into a neighborhood and jacking up every kid in baggy pants. There
might be a short-term reduction in crime, but you pay a long-term
social cost if you alienate the community."</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles defense attorney Stephen Yagman, who since 1978 has
made a career of suing overzealous cops, was practically ready to go
out and buy a new car Wednesday upon hearing that Bratton had gotten
the job.</TE>
<TE>   Yagman says he was at a conference last year in Colorado and heard
Bratton say racial profiling "was an important first tactic to use in
getting criminals off the street."</TE>
<TE>   "I'm really disappointed," Yagman said of Bratton's appointment.
"I would prefer real police reform to making a lot of money off the
bad deeds of the LAPD."</TE>
<TE>   To be fair, I think it's a little early to predict that Bratton's
fourth wife, Rikki Klieman, who made her name during the O.J. trial
and now works as a Court TV anchor, will end up covering his new
department at a brutality trial. (They might actually be the perfect
L.A. couple.)</TE>
<TE>   But if Bratton spends more time straightening his tie than
straightening out the department, the honeymoon may be over in a
hurry.</TE>
<TE>   And if you think this is a heck of a way to welcome a New Yorker
to town, you're taking it the wrong way.</TE>
<TE>   I just wanted to make him feel at home.</TE>

<HD>O.C. Math Professor Hits the Grant Jackpot Again</HD>
<DH>Education: Cal State Fullerton's Pagni to get nearly $6.5
million from the National Science Foundation.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEFF GOTTLIEB</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Cal State Fullerton professor David Pagni's career has been dedicated
to making students better in math, maybe even getting them to enjoy
the subject.</LD>
<LD>   He has dressed as a magician for elementary school students,
taught high school math classes just for girls. He transformed the
song "The 12 Days of Christmas" into a math exercise.</LD>
<LD>   Pagni hit the jackpot this week when he received the largest grant
for a Cal State Fullerton professor, nearly $6.5 million from the
National Science Foundation to spend the next five years showing
teachers how to teach advanced math at four O.C. high schools and
their feeder middle schools.</LD>
<TE>   The largest previous research grant for a Fullerton professor was
$6 million, also from the foundation. The previous record holder?
Pagni, for a program to improve how math is taught to Santa Ana
elementary students.</TE>
<TE>   Pagni, 61, took news of the grant in stride Wednesday. "This is
just another day at the office," he said. "This is what we do at Cal
State Fullerton."</TE>
<TE>   As part of the same national effort aimed at improving education
in kindergarten through 12th grade, UC Irvine this week received a
$14.2-million foundation grant to develop teachers in math and
science, most of it to be used at Orange County schools.</TE>
<TE>   Pagni is not alone in his project. He will head a team that will
place CSUF math professors and full-time teaching coaches at Buena
Park High, Los Amigos High in Fountain Valley, Santiago High in
Garden Grove and Orange High.</TE>
<TE>   They will work not only with the teachers, administrators and
parents at the high schools, but also with their counterparts at the
middle schools who send them students. The idea is that better math
instruction in middle school will result in more high school students
being prepared for advanced classes such as calculus and math
analysis.</TE>
<TE>   The 100 or so faculty involved will take 10 days of classes during
the summer and another 10 during the school year. Teachers who don't
know the subject well enough also will receive lessons.</TE>
<TE>   Pagni said he doesn't have all the answers to boosting students'
math skills.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a research problem," he said. "We have to learn from
research and be doing research ourselves to find how we can crack the
case, because no one has cracked it yet.''</TE>
<TE>   Instead of using annual standardized test scores to rank schools,
Pagni's group will analyze the exams to see where students are not
doing well. They'll also be looking for particular classes that are
especially successful and to find teachers whose techniques are
working.</TE>
<TE>   "We have so much test stuff back from the state that people don't
know how to use," Pagni said.</TE>
<TE>   Teachers also will meet regularly to discuss what works and what
doesn't. "If I have to say there is one big idea, we want to bring
the teachers together as a team to solve these problems," Pagni said.</TE>
<TE>   Ultimately, though, it is the students who will benefit. "The
question is, what do we have to do differently to get success?"</TE>

<DH>Court: Accused Newport lawyer's defense is that the
victim's husband is a mobster who had the killing done. Jury
deliberations begin.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The murder case was already filled with intrigue: A young stripper
turned housewife is slain in the closet of her home in Orange
County's wealthy horse country by a stranger in a business suit who
carries a briefcase and pistol.</LD>
<LD>   The prime suspect, a Newport Beach lawyer, allegedly fakes his
suicide off the Golden Gate Bridge and spends four years on the lam,
working menial jobs in Utah before being run to ground by detectives
who refuse to let the case grow cold.</LD>
<LD>   But if the story of Hugh "Randy" McDonald seemed like fodder for a
television movie to begin with, his trial this week only added to the
mystery surrounding the case.</LD>
<TE>   Prosecutors brought murder charges against McDonald even though
they could not supply a motive for the killing and established only a
tenuous link between McDonald and the victim, Janie Pang, 33.
McDonald, a man whom colleagues described as mild and controlled,
allegedly called on Pang seeking payment for a $20,000 legal debt her
husband owed his firm.</TE>
<TE>   Hoping to establish reasonable doubt, defense lawyers have pointed
the finger at Pang's husband, Danny, a Taiwanese businessman.
Describing him as an abusive husband with ties to Asian organized
crime, defense lawyers claim that Danny Pang hired a professional hit
man to kill his wife. McDonald disappeared several days after Pang's
death not because he committed the crime, defense lawyers say, but
because he was in the throes of a "Walter Mitty" midlife crisis and
chucked his troubled marriage and faltering practice for a life on
the road.</TE>
<TE>   And Danny Pang's own lawyer has suggested that neither McDonald
nor Pang is guilty of the killing. The real culprit, he said, is a
man who grew obsessed with Pang when she danced as a stripper. This
man, attorney William Baker says, stalked and menaced the woman even
as she moved on to a new life.</TE>
<TE>   "I haven't seen any evidence that Randy McDonald has anything to
do with the murder," he said.</TE>
<TE>   On Wednesday, a jury began deliberations in the tangled case.
Among the few solid facts the jury has to work with is that Janie
Pang died about noon on May 30, 1997, in her spacious Crestview
Circle home in Villa Park.</TE>
<TE>   According to the family maid and two of Pang's children, a
clean-cut man with a pencil-thin mustache arrived at the door asking
for her husband. The pair talked casually for a couple of minutes,
until the man drew a semiautomatic pistol. Pang began running and the
maid, terrified, spirited Pang's children out the back door.</TE>
<TE>   Within minutes, the killer caught up with Pang, who tried to hide
in her bedroom closet. The killer fired several .380-caliber rounds
and left her to bleed to death as she lay in a fetal position.</TE>
<TE>   Several days later, whether by coincidence or consequence,
McDonald left his family and staged an elaborate fake suicide,
prosecutors alleged.</TE>
<TE>   Telling his wife he was traveling to the Bay Area for business,
McDonald placed his watch and business card on a ledge of the Golden
Gate Bridge. He also mailed cassette tapes to his wife and son that
suggested he was going to kill himself. But McDonald headed to Utah,
where he began a new, anonymous life.</TE>
<TE>   During his four-year absence, McDonald combed the obituaries of
local papers for aliases, took jobs as a meat-plant laborer and
construction worker and once worked as a paralegal.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutor Walt Schwarm said the reason for his flight is obvious:
He needed to hide after killing Pang. McDonald's lawyer, Michael
Molfetta, offered a radically different explanation.</TE>
<TE>   Far from being a successful Newport Beach attorney, McDonald was a
man in a deep personal crisis. Trapped in a loveless marriage,
McDonald turned to the personal ads and prostitutes for
companionship, his lawyer said. His personal credit card debts
swelled to more than $60,000, and he owed substantial tuition for his
children's schooling. He attempted business ventures that failed and
aided in money laundering schemes.</TE>
<TE>   "We had a Newport Beach lifestyle and tended to spend every dollar
we made," a subdued and monotone McDonald told the jury. "I married a
woman who came from a social status.... I felt I never met their
expectations."</TE>
<TE>   McDonald told jurors that he absolutely did not kill Janie Pang
but that he did seriously intend to kill himself. He said he changed
his mind on the bridge. "I looked down. I was a coward. I couldn't do
it," he said.</TE>
<TE>   At the time of Pang's death, McDonald said, he was with a $400
prostitute, looking for a "little emotional connection." The
prostitute has not been found to corroborate his story.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors have scoffed at the alibi. "If everyone was able to
[give that alibi] when they were accused of a crime, the system would
break down," Schwarm said.</TE>
<TE>   But McDonald's lawyer says that what really broke down in this
case was the investigation into Pang's murder. Arguing that the
investigation was conducted in an incompetent manner, Molfetta said
that local investigators ignored a report compiled by the FBI and the
Orange County and Los Angeles County sheriff's departments.</TE>
<TE>   That report, according to court testimony, noted that Danny Pang
was suspected of being a member of the United Bamboo Triad, an Asian
organized crime group from Taiwan.</TE>
<TE>   The defense also introduced evidence that Janie Pang had reported
to police that her husband had broken her nose and made death
threats.</TE>
<TE>   "This was a hit," Molfetta said. "This is somebody who does this
professionally."</TE>
<TE>   Authorities reject the defense theories, saying they don't believe
Danny Pang was connected to the mob.</TE>
<TE>   However, Danny Pang's lawyer defended his client against the
accusations.</TE>
<TE>   "This claim that Danny Pang was connected with organized crime is
ridiculous," said attorney William Baker. "Maybe he was involved in
some dot-com institutions that failed, but that doesn't make them
illegal. They were just unsuccessful."</TE>

<TE>   That report, according to court testimony, noted that Danny Pang
was suspected of being a member of the United Bamboo Triad, an Asian
crime group from Taiwan. Molfetta and co-defense counsel Michael Reed
portrayed Danny Pang as a shady businessman and million-dollar
gambler who abused his wife.</TE>

threats.</TE>

<TE>   Lawyers for the defense and the prosecution have been barred from
discussing the case outside the courtroom. However, Danny Pang's
lawyer defended his client against the accusations.</TE>
<TE>   "This claim that Danny Pang was connected with organized crime is
ridiculous," said attorney William Baker. "Maybe he was involved in
some dot-com institutions that failed, but that doesn't make them
illegal. They were just unsuccessful. I've never seen anything
suspicious."</TE>
<TE>   Baker said that the Pangs were happily married and that at the
time of her death, Janie was packing for a trip to Hawaii to
celebrate their fifth wedding anniversary.</TE>
<TE>   Baker said that he believes that neither McDonald nor Pang was
involved in the killing. He instead believes it was the work of
another man who was stalking Janie Pang. (Investigators acknowledge
that Pang was being stalked, but say that individual was ruled out as
the killer.)</TE>
<TE>   "I haven't seen evidence pointing to anyone else but the stalker,"
Baker said.</TE>

<HD>New Goals for Oxnard Chief</HD>
<DH>Law enforcement: After being passed over for LAPD post, Art
Lopez says he will stay put.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DARYL KELLEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>After losing his bid for top cop in Los Angeles, Oxnard Police Chief
Art Lopez said Wednesday that he plans to head the 200-officer Oxnard
force until he retires in a few years.</LD>
<LD>   "This was just one of those golden opportunities," said a deflated
Lopez minutes after Los Angeles Mayor James Hahn called with the
news. "It would have been [a dream come true]. I'm a competitive
person, so it doesn't come easy. It's a difficult pill to swallow
when you lose."</LD>
<LD>   But Lopez, 52, said he was already refocusing on a different
goal--gathering new crime-fighting ideas he can use in Oxnard at an
International Assn. of Chiefs of Police conference this weekend in
Minneapolis.</LD>
<TE>   "I'm looking forward to seeing what the best and the brightest are
doing throughout the U.S.," he said, "so I can re-energize myself, so
I'll be a little smarter. And, hopefully, a little bit of this
disappointment will go away."</TE>
<TE>   Oxnard officials, citing a 25% drop in crime during Lopez's
four-year tenure, said the chief will be welcomed home with open
arms.</TE>
<TE>   "I feel bad for Chief Lopez," Mayor Pro Tempore John Zaragosa
said. "I think it's going to be a loss for Los Angeles, but a gain
for Oxnard. I'm happy we're going to have him, but I'm sorry for him,
because he would have done a great job in bringing that department
and that community together."</TE>
<TE>   Lopez has strengthened the Oxnard department's ties to the
blue-collar community since he arrived in 1998 after he was passed
over for the top Los Angeles job. Lopez had climbed steadily through
the ranks of the LAPD--starting as a patrolman in 1971 and ending as
a deputy chief shortly before he left for Oxnard.</TE>
<TE>   In the days since Lopez was named a finalist, six Los Angeles City
Council members had publicly backed him for the job.</TE>
<TE>   He also had strong support within the LAPD.</TE>
<TE>   In Oxnard, Lopez's employers were rooting for him too, and took
pride that he was named a finalist along with former Philadelphia
Police Commissioner John Timoney and William Bratton, the onetime top
cop in New York City whom Hahn chose as the new chief.</TE>
<TE>   Lopez said Hahn never said specifically why Bratton got the nod.</TE>
<TE>   "He just said, 'Hey, listen, you did a great job in all the
interviews, but I decided to select Bill Bratton.... And I said I
stand ready if he needs any help from me," Lopez said.</TE>
<TE>   Lopez ruled out returning to L.A. as a top aide to Bratton.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think so. I don't think that would be an option," he
said. "I'm going to stay here. I'm not looking for another home. This
has been a great marriage with a great city."</TE>
<TE>   Lopez said his support was so strong in Oxnard that he almost
feels like he let down its residents and the City Council by not
getting the job.</TE>
<TE>   "They've been wishing me well throughout the whole process," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   Lopez said he told City Manager Ed Sotelo in 1998 that he planned
to remain in Oxnard for five to eight years, then retire. That is his
plan again, he said. So with his fourth anniversary approaching,
Lopez said he will stay in Oxnard at least one year and possibly
four.</TE>
<TE>   Lopez maintains a condominium near the beach at Channel Islands
Harbor, but his primary residence is in the Porter Ranch development
in the San Fernando Valley.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm still on my timetable," Lopez said. "And I don't have any
aspirations to go anyplace else. I'm going to stay here as long as
this city wants me."</TE>
<TE>   Lopez said there are still some things he wants to accomplish in
Oxnard. Most immediately, he said, he will focus on ending a flare-up
of violence involving Oxnard youth gangs.</TE>
<TE>   "Whenever these things brew up, our strategy has been to come out
with as many resources as we need to put the fire out," he said.
"We've been targeting those individuals we think are responsible.</TE>
<TE>   "You know," he added, "this isn't the end of the world for me.
There's still life after the LAPD."</TE>

<HD>Firefighters Enjoy Newfound Popularity</HD>
<DH>Heroes: As crews work to protect homes, residents are
showing their appreciation.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NORMA ZAMICHOW</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Firefighters battling the Angeles National Forest wildfire never had
it so good.</LD>
<LD>   Residents set up cots and chairs, baked and cooked for them.
Starbucks dropped off pastries. In-N-Out Burger dispatched catering
trucks to fire lines.</LD>
<LD>   "It's the red carpet," said Capt. Tim Davis, a Forest Service
firefighter for 15 years, based in Santa Barbara.</LD>
<TE>   Davis and other firefighters were treated like heroes in the past
week, plied with steaks and lemonade. It wasn't just the food and
invitations to homes, they say. It was the whistles, cheers, pats on
the back, and many thumbs-up.</TE>
<TE>   Firefighters attribute their boost of popularity to one event: the
terrorist attack of Sept. 11, in which 343 New York City firefighters
died while attempting to rescue those trapped in the World Trade
Center.</TE>
<TE>   "If anything good can be said about 9/11, it's that it changed the
perception of what emergency people do," said Capt. Dana Simpson,
who's been with the Kern County Fire Department for 30 years. "I
always considered firefighting a noble profession. Now the public is
starting to see it as a noble profession. I don't say we were taken
for granted before, but the perception of us has changed."</TE>
<TE>   Praise was always expected from residents whose homes were saved,
Simpson said, but now, "there's a groundswell of interest."</TE>
<TE>   That interest, he and others say, isn't limited to the times when
a fire erupts. Requests for tours of fire stations have more than
doubled. Donations to firefighters' associations are up. And a
firefighter at a market, bar or restaurant will periodically be told,
"It's on the house."</TE>
<TE>   "We used to get waves once in a while, and now people wave all the
time," said Capt. Mike Lindbery, who has been a firefighter for 14
years with Ventura County. "There's a new awakening over what we do."</TE>
<TE>   The events of Sept. 11 prompted many Americans to reevaluate their
perceptions of firefighters and police officers. But outside of New
York City, most individuals lacked the chance to show their new
appreciation, experts say.</TE>
<TE>   For Angelenos, the fire in the Angeles National Forest--which
burned 38,094 acres over 10 days before it was contained
Tuesday--provided that chance.</TE>
<TE>   "We now recognize that firefighters do a number of risky daily
activities--Sept. 11 taught us that," said Samuel Sears, an associate
professor of clinical psychology at the University of Florida.
"People in California didn't have as many opportunities to express
the emotional impact of Sept. 11. They are taking the opportunity to
reach out now with firefighters. It's not surprising."</TE>
<TE>   When the fire tore across the hills behind Rick Durfield's
two-story home in La Verne, firefighters were poised and waiting.
Durfield, his wife and his son Tim took tuna sandwiches, soda and
water to the crews. In the morning, they fed them breakfast. They
left their house open, offering their bathroom, and bringing chairs
for firefighters to perch on their lawn.</TE>
<TE>   "We really appreciate your putting your lives on the line on a
daily basis," Durfield, 60, recalled telling the crews.</TE>
<TE>   "We gave them carte blanche. Whatever they needed, we were willing
to do," said Durfield, director of assessment for the accelerated
degree program at Azusa Pacific University.</TE>
<TE>   "9/11 ratcheted up my appreciation," he said. "I love what
firefighters stand for. When you know you could lose your life and
you try to go the extra mile and put your life in extreme
jeopardy--that's heroism."</TE>
<TE>   Down the street from Durfield, Raul Ries, a pastor, drove to a
nearby Vons supermarket, intending to buy bottled water to distribute
to fire crews. He asked the manager whether the store would be
willing to chip in. Yes, he was told. The manager gave 50 cases of
bottled water and six boxes of fruit that Ries distributed from a
pickup in his La Verne neighborhood.</TE>
<TE>   "Firefighters are amazing people," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Alicia Guerrero, 35, watched in horror as the flames galloped over
the ridge behind her home, a house that she and her husband had just
sold and was in escrow.</TE>
<TE>   Firefighters told her, "We're not going to let you lose your
home." Guerrero had no choice; she believed them. It was her daughter
Katie's third birthday, but instead of celebrating, she and her
husband ferried the children to their grandmother's home.</TE>
<TE>   When it became clear that their home in La Verne was safe,
Guerrero's children returned. Katie blew out the candles on her cake.
And Guerrero's 11-year-old son, Joshua, and 7-year-old daughter,
Brianna, made lemonade for the nearby fire crews and police officers.</TE>
<TE>   "We see them as bigger heroes," Guerrero said. "We looked at them
as all doing a job to protect our home."</TE>
<TE>   For many firefighters, this kind of sentiment was overwhelming.
When Simpson described the various offers that poured into the
firefighters' command post, his eyes teared up: thousands of bottles
of water from Wal-Mart, 50 cell phones from Verizon, mom-and-pop
restaurants offering meals.</TE>
<TE>   There were so many offers, in fact, that fire officials began
suggesting that donors contact the Red Cross.</TE>
<TE>   In the year since Sept. 11, Simpson--who is also a logistics chief
who coordinates efforts among federal agencies--has seen similar
compassion from residents around fires he has fought in Utah and
Colorado.</TE>
<TE>   "The public is making a very concerted effort to support our foot
soldiers, the guys who chop and squirt," Simpson said. "It's
nationwide; it's not just an isolated event."</TE>
<TE>   As crews at the command post for the Angeles National Forest fire
began packing up this week, firefighter Brian Young, a 13-year
veteran, found he was moved the most by simple gestures, like the
posters made by children. They reminded Young of his own three
children, who were waiting for him at the family's home outside
Crescent City.</TE>
<TE>   One poster by a fifth-grader was a crayon drawing of a firefighter
extinguishing flames. It read: "Firefighters rock!" Another showed a
fireman in a yellow outfit with a red helmet, and it said: "Firemen
are God."</TE>
<TE>   "To see the love people have for us now makes your heart just
bounce. It gives you tears in your eyes because you know they support
you," Young said. "People have always been there for us, but this is
a new feeling. Too bad it took 9/11 for the nation to see us."</TE>

<HD>District Sued Over Alleged Molestations</HD>
<DH>Oxnard: Families say school officials ignored warnings
about a Camarillo High teacher later accused of sexually abusing
several boys.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JENIFER RAGLAND</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A lawsuit filed Wednesday against the Oxnard Union High School
District accuses school officials of disregarding complaints brought
against a Camarillo teacher years before he was charged with
molesting several of his male students.</LD>
<LD>   In the 44-page complaint, seven teenage boys and their families
allege 23 separate causes of action, including that school and
district officials violated students' civil rights and contributed to
the delinquency of minors when they failed to disclose or act on
information they had about the teacher's allegedly inappropriate
behavior with his students.</LD>
<LD>   Chad Wenzlick Pridgen, 30, who taught upper-level science courses
and coached after-school sports at Camarillo High School for six
years, faces 39 felony and misdemeanor counts alleging various sex
acts with 11 teenage boys. He is free on $500,000 bail.</LD>
<TE>   "It's our belief that, had the school district taken proper action
to protect the students when they knew of Pridgen's misconduct, none
of this would have happened and none of the children would have been
sexually abused or harassed," said Brenda Andrade, the attorney who
filed the complaint in Ventura County Superior Court. "We hope that
the district will set an example for the children in this community
by accepting responsibility for their mistake in this case."</TE>
<TE>   The school district's attorney, Carol Woo, did not return calls
seeking comment.</TE>
<TE>   The lawsuit, which follows a legal claim filed by the same
attorneys against the school district in May, stems from a
months-long investigation by Andrade's law firm.</TE>
<TE>   It alleges that the students were molested and harassed by Pridgen
and that their parents suffered extreme emotional distress after
learning that the district knew about the abuse and "failed to
protect their children from him."</TE>
<TE>   "Chad Pridgen, a teacher, soccer and tennis coach at Adolfo
Camarillo High School, engaged in despicable acts of sexual
misconduct with numerous students over a period of years," the
lawsuit says. "During that time, Oxnard Union High School District
and other named defendants failed to take reasonable steps to ensure
the safety of these children and to prevent future acts of
molestation."</TE>
<TE>   The lawsuit says school officials were put on notice about lewd,
inappropriate and sexually harassing comments Pridgen made to
students on several occasions but failed to investigate any of them.</TE>
<TE>   Andrade and her partner, attorney Kevin DeNoce, also allege that
officials engaged in a conspiracy to cover up their knowledge of
those complaints.</TE>
<TE>   As early as 1999, the lawsuit says, a student and his parents
confronted then-Principal Terry Tackett and Assistant Principal
Billie Covert about Pridgen's alleged inappropriate sexual comments
to students.</TE>
<TE>   Tackett told the parents he would look into the allegations, but
that was never done, according to the lawsuit.</TE>
<TE>   Tackett then denied receiving any complaints about Pridgen until
Andrade and DeNoce produced a tape recording the parents made of the
1999 meeting, they said.</TE>
<TE>   "That's what it takes to keep this school district honest," DeNoce
said. "The only reason they admitted they knew about this is because
the family had to tape-record the meeting."</TE>
<TE>   Other evidence in the civil case includes a letter written by
another Camarillo High coach in October 2001, in which she told
school officials that Pridgen "shares sexually explicit stories from
his personal life" with students in his soccer class.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, the lawsuit says, the coach told the school's
athletic director that she heard Pridgen was having parties with male
students at his house and serving them alcoholic beverages.</TE>
<TE>   Despite these "obvious warning signs," the lawsuit says, the
district failed to supervise Pridgen's activities, failed to
investigate any of the complaints and did not remove him from his
position or report any suspicion of sexual abuse of minors to police.</TE>
<TE>   Several district employees are named in the complaint, including
Principal Sylvia Jackson, former athletic director Mike Smith,
Assistant Supt. Roger Rice and Supt. Gary Davis.</TE>
<TE>   The lawsuit also seeks civil damages from Pridgen for his alleged
sexual assault and battery against children and furnishing alcohol to
minors, among other charges.</TE>
<TE>   Pridgen has been on unpaid leave from the district since his Feb.
5 arrest.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities have accused him of using his power as a teacher to
coerce teenage boys into sex acts with him in his home. The
activities included masturbating while watching pornographic videos
and performing oral sex on him and each other, according to police.
He is scheduled to appear in court Oct. 21.</TE>
<TE>   DeNoce compared the district's actions in the Pridgen case with
the failure of the Roman Catholic Church to remove priests accused of
molesting children in churches across the country.</TE>
<TE>   He and Andrade asked district officials to offer a fair settlement
in order to spare the alleged victims more trauma.</TE>
<TE>   The lawsuit seeks an unspecified amount of general and punitive
damages.</TE>
<TE>   "These are the people who are entrusted with the care and custody
of the children of this community," DeNoce said. "The least they
could do is take responsibility for their failure to act."</TE>

<HD>Crashing Head-On Over Congestion Initiative</HD>
<DH>Elections: Charges of illegality fly from both sides of
measure to shift car tax revenue from the state's general fund toward
easing traffic.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NANCY VOGEL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>Charges of wrongdoing flew Wednesday over Proposition 51, the traffic
congestion measure on the November ballot, with a lawmaker accusing
the authors of illegal "pay for play" tactics and an author in turn
accusing lawmakers of illegally using taxpayer money in opposition to
the initiative.</LD>
<LD>   Written by the Sacramento-based nonprofit Planning and
Conservation League, Proposition 51 would shift 30% of the state's
motor vehicle sales tax revenue away from the general fund and into
projects with a loose aim of easing traffic congestion and replacing
old school buses. Next year that would amount to about $1 billion.</LD>
<LD>   In a Capitol hearing on the budget effects of the measure, Senate
Budget Committee Chairman Steve Peace (D-El Cajon) called it a car
tax hike in disguise. He said lawmakers next year would have no
choice but to increase vehicle license fees to fill the hole left by
Proposition 51.</LD>
<TE>   Peace also said he is gathering testimony from witnesses about
connections between campaign donations and the projects in the ballot
measure. He said he would give the information to the attorney
general.</TE>
<TE>   "We believe we have testimony that lays out at least a prima facie
case for violation of the law," Peace said. But he declined to say
which law or to name witnesses. Peace also said he would not give the
testimony to prosecutors until after the Nov. 5 election because he
did not want the criminal allegations to get tangled in election
politics.</TE>
<TE>   Jerry Meral, executive director of the Planning and Conservation
League, did not attend the hearing Wednesday. But he watched it on
television from home and said afterward, "There's no evidence that
we've committed any wrongdoing."</TE>
<TE>   Calling Peace's allegations "Kafkaesque," Meral said the
Legislature is probably violating a court decision that restricts the
use of public money for lobbying on a ballot measure.</TE>
<TE>   The Legislature usually holds just one pre-election hearing about
a ballot measure. But lawmakers have convened three times on
Proposition 51, including one hearing in Oakland. Another is
scheduled for today in Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   At the hearings, some lawmakers have been outspoken in their
criticism of the measure. Last week, Sen. Kevin Murray (D-Culver
City) called the Planning and Conservation League "initiative pimps."</TE>
<TE>   Many of the more than 40 projects in Proposition 51 would benefit
companies and foundations that have donated heavily to the Yes on 51
campaign.</TE>
<TE>   Pardee Construction and Pardee Homes, for example, have given
$500,000. The home builder stands to benefit from the connection of
Interstate 5 and Route 56 in San Diego County, for which Proposition
51 earmarks $137 million.</TE>
<TE>   The Agua Caliente Band of Cahuilla Indians has also donated
$500,000. The ballot measure includes $120 million for a rail line to
Indio that passes near the tribe's Palm Springs resort and casino.
And the California State Railroad Museum Foundation has donated
$75,000 to Proposition 51, which includes $7 million to build a
railroad technology museum in Sacramento, plus $1 million a year for
operation.</TE>
<TE>   Peace noted in Wednesday's hearing that the ballot measure
includes permanent funding for projects in only six of California's
58 counties.</TE>
<TE>   By shifting nearly $1 billion within an already lean budget next
year, Proposition 51 would make it all but inevitable that the
Legislature would raise vehicle license fees rather than cut payments
to local governments, he said. It is one of the few tax increases
that does not require a two-thirds vote.</TE>
<TE>   "People who vote for Prop. 51 are voting to increase the taxes on
their cars," Peace said. "No way around it."</TE>
<TE>   Meral responded that nothing in the measure raises taxes.
Proposition 51's effect on the general fund is tiny, he said,
compared with the state's overall budget troubles. Officials have
projected a shortfall of $10 billion to $12 billion in next year's
budget.</TE>

<LD>A former UC Santa Cruz student who admitted killing her baby in 1996
has had her sentence commuted by a judge. The action by Superior
Court Judge Art Danner means Joanne De la Cruz won't spend time in
jail.</LD>
<LD>   De la Cruz, 26, was supposed to start a six-month jail sentence
Friday. This year, she pleaded no contest to voluntary manslaughter
for smothering her newborn in a dorm room and dumping it in a trash
bin.</LD>
<LD>   Instead of jail, De la Cruz will be confined to her parents' home
in San Leandro, being allowed out to go to work, see her therapist
and come to Santa Cruz County to perform 500 hours of community
service.</LD>

<HD>Simon Slams Farm Mediation Law</HD>
<DH>Politics: He says the governor signed a UFW-backed bill in
return for donations.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MICHAEL FINNEGAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>FRESNO</DL>
<LD>Republican gubernatorial hopeful Bill Simon Jr. accused Gov. Gray
Davis on Wednesday of signing legislation pushed by the United Farm
Workers union in return for campaign money from organized labor.</LD>
<LD>   Simon said Davis' approval of bills that mandate mediation of
stalled farm labor talks reflects the Democratic incumbent's pattern
of "selling policy to the highest bidder and crippling California's
economy in the process."</LD>
<LD>   On a campaign swing through the San Joaquin Valley, Simon said the
new law would put California farmers at a competitive disadvantage
compared with those in other states and abroad.</LD>
<TE>   "Those union contributions were apparently money well spent, and
the state of California and our farmers are going to have to pay the
price as a result," Simon said.</TE>
<TE>   His comments on the potential impact of the legislation echoed
concerns raised by growers, but none appeared with him at his morning
campaign stop here in the capital of California's agriculture
industry.</TE>
<TE>   But some growers did attend private Simon fund-raisers
Wednesday--a breakfast in Fresno and a lunch in Modesto, according to
his finance chairman, Frank Baxter. Simon went to both events.</TE>
<TE>   Gabriel Sanchez, a spokesman for the Davis reelection campaign,
denied that the governor signed the farm labor legislation because of
campaign contributions.</TE>
<TE>   "Maybe that's the way it worked for Simon when he was engaged in
his own pay-to-play racket, giving thousands to Democratic elected
officials throughout the nation ... to drum up business for his
family's bond firm," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Simon, whose family investment firm has shut down its
municipal-bond underwriting business, has made campaign donations to
Democrats Phil Angelides, the California state treasurer; his
predecessor, Kathleen Brown; and H. Carl McCall, the New York state
comptroller.</TE>

<DH>Crime: Raids target a ring importing ketamine, also known
as Special K, from Mexico into the U.S.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JESSICA GARRISON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SAN DIEGO</DL>
<LD>A cross-border ring that produced and distributed massive amounts of
the drug ketamine, known on the rave circuit as Special K, has been
broken up and its leaders arrested, officials said Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   After a two-year investigation and raids in the United States and
Mexico, authorities arrested seven people and made some of the
largest seizures ever of ketamine.</LD>
<LD>   The drug, an animal tranquilizer that became popular among people
for its hallucinatory effects, is also known as vitamin K, Super K
and Kit Kat. Ketamine also has been used as a date-rape drug.</LD>
<TE>   The investigation began in Simi Valley, after police arrested a
suspect on suspicion of selling the drug in a health club. From
there, investigators picked up a trail that led to a pharmaceutical
manufacturing firm in Morelos, Mexico, called Laboratorios Ttokkyo
and a Tijuana-based veterinary business called Granero de Oro,
authorities said.</TE>
<TE>   The federal indictment announced this week charges that Jorge
Chevreuil Bravo, owner of Granero de Oro, and Dr. Francisco Molino,
head of Ttokkyo, used an Internet Web site to sell ketamine to
distributors across the United States. Neither man was authorized to
export pharmaceuticals, but authorities said their network was
believed to be responsible for 70% to 80% of the drug used illegally
in the United States.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities executed search warrants in New York, Orlando,
Philadelphia, Boston and San Diego. In Kansas, they seized 23,000
vials of the drug. Authorities in Mexico seized another 200,000 vials
last week. The drug, which was declared a controlled substance by the
U.S. government in 1999, is typically sold on the street in
10-millimeter vials for between $50 and $100 a vial, said Assistant
U.S. Atty. Timothy Coughlin. In Southern California, authorities
seized more than $500,000 in cash.</TE>
<TE>   Bravo and Molino were arrested in Panama and transported to Miami
in September. They will eventually be moved to San Diego, Coughlin
said.</TE>
<TE>   Three of the 10 indicted remain at large. The indictment charges
the 10 with participating in a conspiracy to import and distribute
ketamine, conspiracy to launder money, and possession of ketamine
with intent to distribute. Bravo also is charged with engaging in a
continuing criminal enterprise.</TE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In an unusual alliance, the Los Angeles County Chamber of Commerce
and the Los Angeles County Federation of Labor on Wednesday jointly
announced their support of a proposed parcel tax to raise money for
trauma care.</LD>
<LD>   The two groups typically take conflicting positions on business
and labor issues, but stood together on the steps of County-USC
Medical Center to endorse what Chamber of Commerce President Rusty
Hammer called "part of the solution."</LD>
<LD>   The problem is a projected $750-million dollar budget deficit that
threatens to cripple the county's network of 13 trauma centers.</LD>
<TE>   The county has proposed raising approximately $175 million a year
through a tax on developed property of 3 cents per square foot.</TE>
<TE>   "They've already made health cuts," Hammer said, referring to the
September closure of 11 health-care centers and four school-based
clinics. "Now the county needs to raise some revenue and get some
assistance."</TE>
<TE>   Miguel Contreras of the Los Angeles County Federation of Labor
said that sustaining the trauma-care system transcends interest-group
politics.</TE>
<TE>   Measure B requires approval by two-thirds of the county voters.
Officials estimate that the proposed tax would cost the owners of an
average single family home of 1,400 square feet $42.66 annually.</TE>

<BD>From Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Sterling Marlin, who led the Winston Cup standings for 25 weeks, will
sit out the rest of the NASCAR season because of a fractured vertebra
in his neck.</LD>
<LD>   Marlin was injured in a crash Sunday at Kansas City, Kan., and the
break in his vertebra was diagnosed Wednesday at Charlotte, N.C., his
Chip Ganassi Racing team said.</LD>
<LD>   "Could be worse, I could be in a wheelchair," Marlin said. "Ain't
nothing you can do but go after it next year."</LD>
<TE>   Marlin has two victories this season, 14 top-10 finishes and is
fifth in the points standings.</TE>
<TE>   Jamie McMurray, hired to drive a third car for Ganassi next year,
will drive Marlin's car for the rest of the season. But McMurray
won't compete in the Winston Cup race in Martinsville, Va., later
this month because the Busch series, where he is committed to finish
out the season, will be racing at Memphis, Tenn., that weekend.</TE>
<TE>   Tennis</TE>
<TE>   U.S. Open men's champion Pete Sampras has withdrawn from all
remaining ATP tournaments this season.</TE>
<TE>   Sampras, 31, has not played since winning the U.S. Open, his 14th
Grand Slam singles title, last month in New York.</TE>
<TE>   The withdrawal has added to speculation that Sampras is planning
to retire.</TE>
<TE>   He said he is taking time to consider his future.</TE>
<TE>   "Since winning the U.S. Open on Sept. 8, I have been taking some
time to reevaluate where I want to go from here," Sampras said in a
statement released by the ATP. "I'm therefore not sufficiently
prepared to compete in the upcoming tournaments in Madrid, Basel and
Paris."</TE>
<TE>   Sampras will finish out of the ATP's top 10 for the first time
since 1989.</TE>
<TE>   Defending champion Lleyton Hewitt, the world's top-ranked men's

<TE>   In a women's doubles match, Anna Kournikova, who was teamed with
American Megann Shaughannesy, retired in the third set because of an
ankle injury. Kournikova and Shaughannesy lost to Dokic and Nadia
Petrova.</TE>
<TE>   The extent of Kournikova's injury was not immediately known, and
it was not clear if she would play Petrova today in a singles match.</TE>
<TE>   In a first-round men's match, Bohdan Ulihrach defeated Australian
Open champion Thomas Johansson, 7-6 (5), 7-6 (2). Top-seeded Marat

<TE>   Point guard Mark Jackson, 37, signed with the Utah Jazz after

he made it clear he didn't want to play for a rebuilding team, the
Nuggets bought out his contract and he became a free agent.</TE>

<DL>SEATTLE</DL>
<LD>Washington assistant basketball coach Cameron Dollar has been
suspended without pay for one month for a series of recruiting
violations, Athletic Director Barbara Hedges said Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   Dollar also was banned from off-campus recruiting for the rest of
the academic school year and had his pay reduced until April 2003 for
violations that included improper evaluations of prospective
recruits, phone calls, and face-to-face meetings with prospects and
their family members.</LD>
<LD>   "I blew it," a tearful Dollar said. "I've shown the university in
a bad light, and for that I'm sorry."</LD>
<TE>   Hedges said one of the violations alone would not be serious, but
the collection of infractions needed to be dealt with quickly.</TE>
<TE>   Dollar, a former UCLA guard, said he knew he was bending the
rules, but his eagerness to resurrect the Washington program clouded
his judgment.</TE>
<TE>   "This is the first time I've ever been questioned about my
methods," Dollar said. "It was a frightful thought."</TE>

<LD>THE BIG PLAYS</LD>
<LD>   Everyone will talk about Troy Percival striking out Derek Jeter,
but if Garret Anderson and Troy Glaus don't homer in the eighth,
Percival never pitches. The Angels had just blown a 4-0 lead, and it
seemed they would be down 2-0 in the series until the consecutive
homers put them back in control of the game and quieted the Yankee
faithful.</LD>
<LD>   *</LD>
<TE>   NOT IN THE BOX SCORE</TE>
<TE>   Aggressive baserunning led to three Angel runs. Shawn Wooten went
from first to third on a single in the second, scoring on the next
play. In the third, Garret Anderson tagged up and took second on Troy
Glaus' fly to left, scoring on Scott Spiezio's single. In the ninth,
Anderson went from first to third on Glaus' single, scoring on
Spiezio's hit.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   THE BIG LETDOWN</TE>
<TE>   It seemed as if the Angel jinx was alive and well when Benji Gil
failed to turn the double play and bounced his throw past Scott
Spiezio at first base in the sixth inning. When Alfonso Soriano
followed with a two-run homer, giving the Yankees the lead for the
first time, you could almost hear the ghost of Gene Autry crying.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   DID YOU NOTICE?</TE>
<TE>   Orlando Hernandez, so ineffective as a starter that Manager Joe
Torre sent him to the bullpen for the playoffs, was visibly annoyed
at Derek Jeter after Jeter made a throwing error in the seventh. The
error did not lead to a run, but Hernandez made two mistakes that
cost the Yankees the game, giving up homers to Anderson and Glaus in
the eighth.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>FIRST INNING</LD>
<LD>   ANGELS: Angels 1, Yankees 0--David Eckstein flied to left. Darin
Erstad grounded sharply to shortstop. Andy Pettitte got ahead of Tim
Salmon, 0 and 2, then gave up a deep homer to left on a 3-and-2
pitch. There were so many "Wooooooos" in the Angel dugout, it sounded
as though Ric Flair had joined the team. Pettitte then made Garret
Anderson look like a Little Leaguer, striking him out on an off-speed
breaking pitch. One run, one hit.</LD>
<LD>   YANKEES: Angels 1, Yankees 0--Alfonso Soriano grounded to the
pitcher. Derek Jeter hit a slow grounder up the middle that was
fielded by Benji Gil, who had no chance to throw out Jeter at first.
Kevin Appier seemed to want no part of Jason Giambi, walking him on
five pitches. Bernie Williams flied to deep center, Jeter taking
third. Robin Ventura grounded to first. No runs, one hit, two left.</LD>
<TE>   SECOND INNING</TE>
<TE>   ANGELS: Angels 3, Yankees 0--Troy Glaus flied to deep right. Scott
Spiezio, perhaps still upset he didn't field Giambi's hit in Game 1,
homered to left. Shawn Wooten hit a blooper that fell between Soriano
and Raul Mondesi, who didn't communicate well on the play. Wooten,
who appears to be on the Mo Vaughn diet, stopped at first. Bengie
Molina almost took Pettitte's head off with a single to center and
Wooten, amazingly, chugged all the way to third, the ground shaking
with every step. Gil singled to center, Wooten scoring, Molina to
second. Eckstein flied to center. Erstad popped to the catcher. Two
runs, four hits, two left.</TE>
<TE>   YANKEES: Angels 3, Yankees 0--Jorge Posada struck out swinging.
Nick Johnson broke his bat and popped to second. By the way, Tim
McCarver never stops talking. On a 1-and-2 pitch, Mondesi was hit on
the left arm by a pitch. Juan Rivera grounded to second and was
thrown out at first despite his dive into the bag. That never works.
No runs, no hits, one left.</TE>
<TE>   THIRD INNING</TE>
<TE>   ANGELS: Angels 4, Yankees 0--Salmon grounded off Pettitte's glove,
the ball deflecting to Jeter, who threw Salmon out at first. Anderson
singled to left-center. Glaus flied to deep left, Anderson taking
second when Soriano couldn't hold on to the throw. Spiezio singled to
center, Anderson scoring. Wooten singled to right, Spiezio stopping
at second. Molina grounded to short. One run, three hits, two left.</TE>
<TE>   YANKEES: Angels 4, Yankees 1--Soriano struck out swinging. At this
point, the Fox telecast kept showing a little kid in the stands. Must
be their tribute to Vin Scully. Appier hung a curve and Jeter homered
to left. Giambi lined to first. Williams grounded to second. One run,
one hit.</TE>
<TE>   FOURTH INNING</TE>
<TE>   ANGELS: Angels 4, Yankees 1--Orlando Hernandez pitching. Gil hit a
liner off Hernandez's right arm and was thrown out by Jeter. Eckstein
grounded to short. Erstad batting, which gave McCarver another chance
to remind us that he was a punter at Nebraska. Hey Tim, we don't need
to be told that every time he bats. Erstad grounded to short. No
runs, no hits.</TE>
<TE>   YANKEES: Angels 4, Yankees 3--Ventura hit a blooper that landed
between Erstad and Eckstein, who slid into each other like two
synchronized swimmers. Posada flied to right. After fouling off
several full-count pitches, Johnson walked. Mondesi popped to first.
Rivera hit a blooper to center that just eluded a diving Erstad,
Ventura and Johnson scoring. Soriano grounded to short. Two runs, two
hits, one left.</TE>
<TE>   FIFTH INNING</TE>
<TE>   ANGELS: Angels 4, Yankees 3--Salmon struck out swinging. Anderson
flied to center. Glaus took a pitch right down the middle for strike
three. No runs, no hits.</TE>
<TE>   YANKEES: Angels 4, Yankees 3--Jeter singled to center. Giambi
walked and it looked as if Appier was about finished. Pitching coach
Bud Black came out to talk to Appier. Williams flied to center, Jeter
beating the throw to third. Robin Ventura at the plate (please, Mike
Scioscia, don't bring in Schoeneweis). Ventura struck out swinging.
Will someone please put tape on Molina's fingers so he won't have to
visit the mound anymore? This inning is taking forever. Spiezio
snatched Posada's line drive. No runs, one hit, two left.</TE>
<TE>   SIXTH INNING</TE>
<TE>   ANGELS: Angels 4, Yankees 3--Spiezio popped to shallow left.
Wooten struck out. It looks as if the Yankees should have started
Hernandez, not Pettitte. Molina flied to center. No runs, no hits.</TE>
<TE>   YANKEES: Yankees 5, Angels 4--Francisco Rodriguez pitching.
Johnson struck out on a curveball that bounced about eight feet in
front of the plate. Mondesi singled to left-center. Rivera grounded
to short, but in his attempt to turn two, Gil threw the ball past
Spiezio at first, Rivera taking second on the error. On an 0-and-2
pitch, Soriano homered to left. Jeter flied to right. Two runs, two
hits.</TE>
<TE>   SEVENTH INNING</TE>
<TE>   ANGELS: Yankees 5, Angels 4--Adam Kennedy pinch-hit for Gil and
struck out. Eckstein grounded to second. Erstad grounded into the
hole at short, but Jeter made an uncharacteristic error, throwing the
ball past first, Erstad taking second on the error. Hernandez was
visibly upset with Jeter for the error. Nice going, Orlando. Salmon
grounded to third. No runs, one hit, one error, one left.</TE>
<TE>   YANKEES: Yankees 5, Angels 4--Giambi flied to right. Williams
grounded to first. Ventura grounded to first as the Yankees go in
order for the first time in Game 2. No runs, no hits.</TE>
<TE>   EIGHTH INNING</TE>
<TE>   ANGELS: Angels 7, Yankees 5--Anderson homered to right. Glaus
homered to center and Yankee Stadium became eerily quiet. Steve
Karsay replaced Hernandez. Wooten reached on an infield single. Chone
Figgins ran for Wooten. Figgins stole second. Molina bounced a single
into center, but Figgins, not knowing where the shortstop was
playing, stopped at third. Mike Stanton replaced Karsay. Kennedy
flied to the right-field wall, Figgins scoring. Eckstein singled to
center. Erstad flied to right. Three runs, five hits, two left.</TE>
<TE>   YANKEES: Angels 7, Yankees 5--Ben Weber pitching. Posada grounded
to second. Johnson singled to left. In a play reminiscent of Game 1,
Mondesi grounded up the middle, but Weber deflected the ball,
allowing Mondesi to reach first. Shocking Angel fans everywhere,
Scioscia brought in Brendan Donnelly instead of Troy Percival to
replace Weber. John Vander Wal hit for Rivera and took strike three
on the corner. Mike Scioscia is a genius. Now Percival comes in. He
hit Soriano in the back with his first pitch. Jeter struck out
looking. No runs, two hits, three left.</TE>
<TE>   NINTH INNING</TE>
<TE>   ANGELS: Angels 8, Yankees 5--Jeff Weaver pitching. Vander Wal in
left. Anderson singled to right. Glaus singled to center, Anderson
taking third. Spiezio doubled down the right-field line, Anderson
scoring, Glaus stopping at third. Brad Fullmer was walked
intentionally. Molina grounded into a 6-4-3 double play. One run,
three hits, two left.</TE>
<TE>   YANKEES: Angels 8, Yankees 6--Giambi singled to left. Williams
struck out swinging. Ventura singled to right, Giambi taking third.
Posada singled to left, Giambi scoring, Ventura stopping at second.
Enrique Wilson ran for Posada. Johnson struck out swinging. Mondesi
popped to short. One run, three hits, two left.</TE>

<KH>AMERICAN LEAGUE DIVISION SERIESGAME 2 ANGELS 8, YANKEES 6</KH>
<HD>Escape From New York</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>BILL SHAIKIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Troy Percival got his save. Maybe it was a day late. Maybe it was a
tad too suspenseful. Frankly, in the early hours of this morning, the
Angels were too drained, too exhausted and too relieved to care about
anything but the final score.</LD>
<LD>   And, when shortstop David Eckstein caught a pop fly at 12:31 a.m.
EDT, one that he said took "a very long time" to descend, the Angels
had subdued the relentless New York Yankees, 8-6. Percival got his
save. The rest can wait until after the Angels rest.</LD>
<LD>   "Mentally, I'm pretty exhausted," Percival said. "Physically, I
feel pretty good. I can go out there and throw three innings if I
have to."</LD>
<TE>   The Angels lost the first game of the best-of-five division series
and won the second game, and the burning question in each game was
the same: How would Angel Manager Mike Scioscia use his closer?</TE>
<TE>   Scioscia wouldn't use him for 1 1/3 innings Tuesday, and the
Angels lost. He used him for 1 1/3 innings Wednesday, and the Angels
won. Too simple, perhaps, but this isn't: The Angels split the two
games here, so the series moves to Anaheim for the next two games.
Win those two, and the Angels need not return to Yankee Stadium. Win
two of three, with home-field advantage now on the Angels' side, and
the Angels win the series.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not going to go and say we're going to run the table on them
in Anaheim," left fielder Garret Anderson said. "But to take one in
somebody else's park in the playoffs, you've accomplished something,
especially in this park, where they make things happen."</TE>
<TE>   After two tense games, with Wednesday's game lasting four hours
and 11 minutes, with the teams combining for 29 hits and eight
pitching changes amid the cacophony of Yankee Stadium, center fielder
Darin Erstad was too exhausted to think ahead.</TE>
<TE>   "This has been like playing 40 regular-season games in a row," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels blew a 4-0 lead and still won. First baseman Scott
Spiezio had three hits, including a home run, and drove in three
runs. In the eighth inning, Anderson and Troy Glaus tagged Yankee
starter-turned-reliever Orlando Hernandez for back-to-back home runs.</TE>
<TE>   Anderson tied the score, 5-5, and Glaus put the Angels ahead to
stay. Glaus, doing his finest imitation of a college basketball
player who struggles in the regular season and shines in the
spotlight of the NCAA tournament, has hit three home runs in his last
seven at-bats.</TE>
<TE>   Glaus, who rarely displays even a hint of emotion, pumped his fist
as he rounded first base.</TE>
<TE>   Percival pumped his fist after the final out, but he does that
after every save. One night after Scioscia left his closer marooned
in the bullpen, Percival got his save.</TE>
<TE>   With the Angels ahead, 7-5, Ben Weber started the eighth inning,
as he did in Tuesday's wrenching defeat. Weber got one out, then gave
up back-to-back singles to Nick Johnson and Raul Mondesi. The latter
hit caromed off the bare hand of Weber, and Scioscia and pitching
coach Bud Black walked to the mound to check on the injured pitcher.
Weber was diagnosed with a sprained index finger and will undergo
X-rays today in Anaheim.</TE>
<TE>   Percival was warming up in the bullpen. Scioscia opted for Brendan
Donnelly, who had not been warming up.</TE>
<TE>   Percival shrugged twice, for a national television audience to
see. Scioscia hadn't used Percival to get five outs all season, and
he wasn't about to start now.</TE>
<TE>   "I was a little puzzled," Percival said. "I had my adrenaline
going. I had my reins pulled back."</TE>
<TE>   Donnelly struck out pinch-hitter John Vander Wal.</TE>
<TE>   Now, there were two outs in the eighth, with the game on the line,
the same situation in which Scioscia left Percival stranded in the
bullpen Tuesday. This time, he summoned Percival.</TE>
<TE>   "Buddy Black was kicking me to get out there," Scioscia said.</TE>
<TE>   This time, Scioscia explained, there was no left-handed hitter for
left-hander Scott Schoeneweis to face.</TE>
<TE>   "I was chomping at the bit to get out there," Percival said.</TE>
<TE>   On his first pitch, at the stroke of midnight, he hit Alfonso
Soriano in the back, with a 97-mph fastball. Percival had not hit a
batter all season. The Yankees had the tying run in scoring position,
the winning run on first base.</TE>
<TE>   The next batter, Derek Jeter, had reached base in seven of eight
plate appearances in the series. Percival struck him out on four
pitches, the last a 98-mph fastball on the outside corner.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels added a run in the ninth, on a double by Spiezio, and
so Percival took an 8-5 lead to the bottom of the ninth.</TE>
<TE>   Nothing came easy for the Angels this season, including the final
three outs Wednesday. The Yankees got three hits and suddenly trailed
8-6, with the tying runs on base, the winning run at the plate and
one out.</TE>
<TE>   Johnson struck out. Mondesi popped up. Game over. Save, Percival.</TE>
<TE>   It was the first time the Yankees have lost a postseason game at
Yankee Stadium when they led after the seventh inning.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels led, 4-3, in the sixth when they tried their new kid in
the bullpen, bypassing long reliever Scot Shields for 20-year-old
phenom Francisco Rodriguez. It didn't work, but Rodriguez was not
completely to blame.</TE>
<TE>   Rodriguez struck out Johnson, gave up a single to Mondesi, then
got Juan Rivera to ground into an apparent inning-ending double play.
But second baseman Benji Gil juggled the relay from Eckstein, then
threw wildly to first base for an error. Mondesi was forced at
second, but Gil's inability to complete the double play extended the
inning.</TE>
<TE>   Soriano, the next batter, golfed an 0-2 curveball over the
left-field fence, a two-run homer that gave the Yankees a 5-4 lead.
As Soriano circled the bases, Gil lowered his head, an expression of
atonement and frustration.</TE>
<TE>   Kevin Appier, who appeared to run out of gas toward the end of the
regular season, pitched more on guts than on fuel Wednesday. He
pitched a total of 15 innings in the final three starts of the
regular season, and he sweated out five innings. He needed 91 pitches
to do so, falling behind in the count consistently.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels did another terrific job exhausting the Yankees'
starting pitcher. Andy Pettitte, who had lost once since July 23, was
gone after three innings, and after the Angels had piled up eight
hits.</TE>
<TE>   Pettitte made 66 pitches. In the two games of the series, Pettitte
and Roger Clemens combined to make 179 pitches in 8 2/3 innings. But
the last one belonged to Percival.</TE>

<KH>ANGEL REPORT</KH>
<HD>Scioscia Still Goes With First Guess</HD>
<DH></DH>

<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>The Angels lost in the 1986 playoffs, and to this day fans ask why
Manager Gene Mauch yanked Mike Witt. The Dodgers lost in the 1985
playoffs, and to this day fans ask why Manager Tom Lasorda let Tom
Niedenfuer pitch to Jack Clark with first base open.</LD>
<LD>   If the Angels lose this series, the question will dog Manager Mike
Scioscia forever: Why didn't you use Troy Percival?</LD>
<LD>   One day after the Angels' 8-5 loss to the New York Yankees in
Tuesday's division series opener, in which Percival remained in the
bullpen while the Yankees scored four runs in the eighth inning,
Scioscia insisted he did not regret losing the game without using his
closer, although he said he spent "eight hours tossing and turning"
before deciding he made the right decision after all.</LD>
<TE>   "If I had gotten up this morning and it first occurred to me that
we could have brought Percival in, I would have second-guessed
myself," Scioscia said.</TE>
<TE>   The situation in question: With the Angels leading, 5-4, and two
out in the eighth inning, the Yankees had the tying run on second
base and the go-ahead run on first. With Jason Giambi up, Scioscia
opted to summon Scott Schoeneweis rather than use his best reliever
to face the Yankees' best hitter.</TE>
<TE>   Giambi tied the score with a hard-hit single off the glove of
first baseman Scott Spiezio, and Bernie Williams followed with the
game-winning home run, off Brendan Donnelly.</TE>
<TE>   In five career at-bats off Percival, Giambi had struck out every
time. In 20 at-bats off Schoeneweis, Giambi had five hits--three of
which, Scioscia said, were infield singles.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels had used Percival four times this season to get the
final out of the eighth inning. He blew the save twice--once against
the Yankees, on a home run by Williams. In Game 2, Percival struck
out Derek Jeter to end the eighth, then gave up a run in the ninth,
with Giambi getting a single.</TE>
<TE>   Scioscia was widely roasted for his Game 1 decision. The New York
Post picked a "stud and dud" of the game and proclaimed Scioscia the
dud, running a picture of him with the caption: "Where was Percival?"
Former Angel third baseman Doug DeCinces, still cringing at the
thought of Mauch using Luis Sanchez instead of Andy Hassler in relief
in the 1982 playoffs, said Scioscia was a fine manager who made "a
huge mistake."</TE>
<TE>   Still, Scioscia didn't hide from the fallout Wednesday. In a
pregame session with dozens of reporters, before any questions could
be asked, Scioscia grinned widely and said, "Who would have brought
Percival in? Give me a show of hands! Everybody's hand has got to go
up!"</TE>
<TE>   If the Angels lose the series, Scioscia understands the questions
about his decision will not stop.</TE>
<TE>   "I'll talk about this all winter if you guys want to keep calling
my home," he said. "I don't care."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Cleveland Indians are leaning toward retaining interim manager
Joel Skinner on a full-time basis, but they would like to interview
Angel pitching coach Bud Black for the job before making a decision.
Cleveland General Manager Mark Shapiro said that he would defer
asking for permission to talk to any candidate working for a playoff
team until that team is eliminated, so that those candidates could
focus on playoff preparations.</TE>
<TE>   Black, 45, pitched in Cleveland for four seasons.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   This just in: The New York Daily News reported Wednesday that the
Yankees already have qualified for the 2003 playoffs. In discussing
outfielder Raul Mondesi's plan to retire after his contract expires
next season, the Daily News reported that unless Mondesi changes his
mind, this postseason would mark "his second-to-last trip into
October."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Brian Downing and Bobby Grich, the only two players on each of the
Angels' three American League West championship teams (1979, 1982 and
1986), will throw out the ceremonial first pitches before Friday's
game in Anaheim.</TE>

<TE>   For 80 years, Yankee Stadium has served New York as a source of
civic pride and as a historical landmark. But since the terrorist
attacks of Sept. 11, it also has served as a makeshift memorial site,
according to Yankee General Manager Brian Cashman.</TE>
<TE>   "We get a lot of calls," Cashman said, "from people who lost loved
ones on that day, loved ones who were huge Yankee fans. There were no
remains to bury, meaning they don't have a cemetery to visit. So
instead, they come here because it allows them to feel close to the
loved one. They can reflect here. They will go to church and then
come here because they have no other place to go. They can't go to a
grave site because there is none."</TE>

<TE>   The Yankees may have beaten the Angels in Game 1 Tuesday night,
but Los Angeles edged New York in the television ratings.</TE>
<TE>   The Fox telecast averaged a 15.9 Nielsen rating with a 26 share of
the audience in L.A., compared to a 15.8/24 in New York.</TE>
<TE>   What makes this particularly surprising is the fact the game began
at 5 p.m. in L.A., yet in New York it began at 8 p.m. and was on
during prime-time hours.</TE>
<TE>   Nationally, the game averaged a 6.6/11, which is up 12% over Fox's
first prime-time baseball postseason telecast last year (Oakland vs.
the Yankees). Tuesday night's game drew 9.5 million viewers, making
it the most-watched and highest-rated non-Game 5 first-round game
since 1999.</TE>
<TE>   Tuesday's other two first-round playoff games also fared well in
the ratings, even though some baseball fans may have had trouble
finding ABC Family.</TE>
<TE>   Minnesota-Oakland got a 1.8 rating, up from a 1.4 from the
comparable game on Fox Family last year (Atlanta-Houston), and drew
1.88 million viewers.</TE>
<TE>   The late game between St. Louis and Arizona delivered a 1.6 and
drew 1.78 million viewers. The game ranked No. 1 in its time period,
which was 8-11 p.m. in the West and 11 p.m.-2 a.m. in the East.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Here's some good news for those who don't have cable television
and can't get ABC Family: Game 3 of the Angel-Yankee series Friday at
5 p.m. at Edison Field will be televised by both ABC Family and Los
Angeles' Channel 11.</TE>
<TE>   Even though Channel 11 is a Fox station, it will carry ABC
Family's game coverage, which is produced by Disney-owned ESPN.</TE>
<TE>   It may seem strange to see ESPN's Jon Miller and Joe Morgan on a
Fox station, but then the whole television setup for the first round
of the playoffs is strange--and more than a little confusing.</TE>

<HD>Stunning Role Reversal at Yankee Stadium</HD>
<DH>Game 2: Angels earn respect in New York clubhouse with
come-from-behind victory.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE SPRINGER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>It was so quiet in the Yankee clubhouse, you could hear a pinstripe
drop.</LD>
<LD>   Gone was the joy, the wide-eyed amazement, the laughter over that
baseball phenomenon known as Yankee mystique.</LD>
<LD>   With an 8-6 come-from-behind victory Wednesday night in the second
game of this American League division series, the Angels had thrown a
pall over the room that had been brimming with confidence 24 hours
earlier.</LD>
<TE>   As they drifted out of the trainer's room or the eating area,
heads down, walking slowly and resolutely, the Yankees gave the
Angels the respect they had earned.</TE>
<TE>   To a man, the Yankees used such words as "battlers," "tough," and
"talented" to describe the team that had just evened the best-of-five
series at a game apiece.</TE>
<TE>   "You don't get a free pass into the postseason," Yankee shortstop
Derek Jeter said.</TE>
<TE>   "They had to be doing something right. They are a tough team."</TE>
<TE>   Much had been made of the Angels' lack of postseason experience. A
cartoon in a New York newspaper had depicted a giant figure in a
Yankee uniform taking aim with his bat at a diminutive, helpless
looking pitcher in an Angel uniform.</TE>
<TE>   The headline read "Angel Food."</TE>
<TE>   But that was before Game 2.</TE>
<TE>   "People said they didn't have postseason experience," Jeter said.
"They do now. Those guys don't give up. They fought off quality
pitches to stay in there."</TE>
<TE>   What about the momentum the Yankees had supposedly built up
Tuesday when the Angels lost a heartbreaker?</TE>
<TE>   "If that was the case," Jeter said, "we would have won. Momentum
is as good as your next game's starting pitcher."</TE>
<TE>   Said Yankee reliever Mike Stanton of the disparity in postseason
play between the two teams: "There has been a whole lot of talk about
experience.</TE>
<TE>   "You know what, it doesn't mean a whole lot if you don't go out
there and perform."</TE>
<TE>   Jeter could not be accused of failing to perform. He had reached
base his first seven times up in this series going five-for-five with
a pair of walks.</TE>
<TE>   After fouling out in the sixth inning, Jeter came up in the eighth
to face Angel closer Troy Percival with two out, the bases loaded and
the game on the line.</TE>
<TE>   Uncharacteristically, Jeter took a called third strike on the
outside corner.</TE>
<TE>   Jeter was undaunted, however, in the clubhouse.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a ball," he said.</TE>
<TE>   End of subject.</TE>
<TE>   Jeter stood at the plate long after the Angels had departed for
the dugout, talking to home-plate umpire Doug Eddings.</TE>
<TE>   What did they say to each other?</TE>
<TE>   "You'll have to ask him," Jeter said.</TE>
<TE>   But he knew it was a useless conversation.</TE>
<TE>   "He's not going to call the other team back on the field," said
the Yankee shortstop.</TE>
<TE>   And Jeter was not about to say he won't continue to relish such
situations.</TE>
<TE>   "You want to be up," he said. "That's why you play. That's what
you dream of as a youngster. That's what you dream of now.</TE>
<TE>   "But that doesn't mean you are going to be successful."</TE>
<TE>   And, as the Yankees acknowledged Wednesday, just because they are
playing in Yankee Stadium doesn't necessarily mean they are going to
be successful.</TE>

<HD>Mulder Is Big Bore as A's Square Series</HD>
<DH>Baseball: Oakland left-hander baffles the Twins in 9-1
victory before crowd of 31,953. Chavez, Justice have the big hits.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE DiGIOVANNA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>OAKLAND</DL>
<LD>Tim Hudson is the ace of Oakland's rotation, the right-hander with
the shaved head, elongated soul patch and nasty split-fingered
fastball, and Barry Zito is the team's leading Cy Young Award
candidate, the quirky left-hander who travels with pink satin pillow
cases and has a passion for Taoism and other Eastern religions.</LD>
<LD>   And then there is Mark Mulder, the 25-year-old Athletic
left-hander whom Minnesota first baseman Doug Mientkiewicz refers to
as "the same-old, boring, shut-you-out-for-seven-innings Mark
Mulder."</LD>
<LD>   The Zen-master General he isn't, but what Mulder seems to lack in
odd personality traits or menacing looks, he more than makes up for
in stuff, a point he drove home again Wednesday in Oakland's 9-1 rout
of the Twins in Game 2 of an American League division series.</LD>
<TE>   A sparse Network Associates Coliseum crowd of 31,953 saw Mulder
limit Minnesota to one run and five hits and strike out three in six
innings, as the A's evened the best-of-five series at one game
apiece. Game 3 is Friday in Minneapolis.</TE>
<TE>   Third baseman Eric Chavez and left fielder David Justice provided
the big blows, Chavez hitting a three-run home run in the first
inning and Justice a three-run triple to highlight a five-run fourth,
as Oakland ended a five-game home playoff losing streak dating to
Game 2 of the 2000 AL division series.</TE>
<TE>   Mixing a 95-mph fastball, sinker, cut-fastball and slow curve,
Mulder allowed one runner to reach second base in the first five
innings before giving up Corey Koskie's leadoff homer in the sixth.
That cut the lead to 9-1.</TE>
<TE>   What made his performance even more impressive is that players
from both teams agreed Mulder didn't have his best stuff. Mulder, who
limited Twin left-handers to one hit in 11 at-bats, said he was
overthrowing a bit and left too many balls up in the strike zone.</TE>
<TE>   "What makes him so good is he makes adjustments to you,"
Mientkiewicz said. "If you're looking inside, he goes away; if you're
looking away, he goes in.... You don't see too many guys throwing 95
with that much movement."</TE>
<TE>   Another Mulder strength: He seems unflappable, which is why
Oakland Manager Art Howe set up his playoff rotation so that Mulder,
as he did against the Yankees in last year's division series, will
start Game 5 if necessary.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think anybody would get rattled with his stuff,"
Mientkiewicz said. "The most emotion I've seen from him is when he
gave up three home runs to us [Sept. 1]. He smacked his glove and we
thought, 'This guy is coming unglued.' He's a confident young man. In
a perfect world, I'd like to see him next year, not in Game 5."</TE>
<TE>   As they did in Game 1 Tuesday, the A's scored three runs in the
first inning Wednesday, as Ray Durham walked, Scott Hatteberg doubled
to right and Chavez smoked a home run to right, sending a 1-and-1 Joe
Mays fastball far over the wall.</TE>
<TE>   Chavez dropped his bat in the box and admired his work for a
moment before breaking into his trot, but no one in the Oakland
dugout considered it a victory lap.</TE>
<TE>   The Twins overcame deficits of 3-0 in the first inning and 5-1 in
the second in Tuesday's 7-5 win, and it looked as if they could hang
around long enough to mount another comeback Wednesday when Mays
escaped a first-and-third, no-out jam in the second and a
bases-loaded, two-out jam in the third.</TE>
<TE>   But the A's pounded Mays and reliever Tony Fiore for five two-out
runs in the fourth and added another run in the fifth, putting the
Twins in a 9-0 hole.</TE>
<TE>   Durham was hit by a pitch with one out and Miguel Tejada, who
struck out with runners on in the sixth and eighth innings Tuesday,
lined an RBI double to left-center with two out. Chavez was
intentionally walked, and Minnesota Manager Ron Gardenhire put in
Fiore.</TE>
<TE>   Jermaine Dye walked, and up stepped Justice, who has played in
more postseason games (109) than any player in major league history
and has hinted that this season may be his last.</TE>
<TE>   Justice grounded career postseason hit No. 88 into the right-field
corner for a bases-clearing triple. Mark Ellis capped the rally with
an RBI infield single for an 8-0 lead, and Durham's double and
Hatteberg's RBI single extended the lead to 9-0 in the fifth.</TE>
<TE>   "At that point," Mientkiewicz said, "it was, 'Hurry up so they
don't score 40 runs against us.' There wasn't much to worry about
after the fifth inning."</TE>

<KH>TWIN-A'S REPORT</KH>
<HD>Chavez Turns Pain of Last Season Into Source of Inspiration
for A's</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Mike DiGiovanna</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>OAKLAND</DL>
<LD>Few Oakland players took last year's American League division series
loss to the New York Yankees as hard as third baseman Eric Chavez.
Had he not gone three for 21 with no runs batted in, Chavez thought,
the A's probably wouldn't have lost the five-game series after
winning the first two games in New York.</LD>
<LD>   "I had a little talk with him about that," A's center fielder
Terrence Long said. "The thing about the playoffs is it's going to
take everyone to win. You can't put all the pressure on yourself."</LD>
<LD>   Chavez took Long's advice to heart. He seems far more relaxed in
his third postseason series, and the results have been striking:
Chavez had two run-scoring singles in Game 1 Tuesday and hit his
first playoff home run, a three-run shot in the first inning, to
catapult the A's toward a 9-1 victory over the Minnesota Twins in
Game 2 Wednesday.</LD>
<TE>   "Last year, I took myself out of the game by trying to go deep,"
said Chavez, who also singled in the third inning and walked and
scored in the fourth. "That's when I get into trouble. You go into
slumps when you try to hit home runs. You need hits. I'm just trying
to get some singles."</TE>
<TE>   Chavez, whose 34-homer, 109-RBIs season was somewhat overshadowed
by Miguel Tejada hitting .308 with 34 homers and 131 RBIs, has so
much natural power, Long doesn't think he needs to swing for the
fences.</TE>
<TE>   "We call him instant offense, because as soon as he puts a bat in
his hands, if there are two runners on, we can score three runs,"
Long said. "He can mis-hit balls and they still go 400 feet. There's
no reason to try to go deep."</TE>
<TE>   But deep Chavez went in the first inning Wednesday, blasting a Joe
Mays pitch far over the 367-foot mark in right field. There was so
little doubt the ball was gone that Chavez, who is known for his
cockiness, flipped his bat in the box and stared at the ball for a
moment before beginning his trot.</TE>
<TE>   "But I don't think he was intentionally trying to pose or
anything," Oakland closer Billy Koch said. "It was more of a
statement: 'Here we are, we're not going anywhere, we're going to
battle you to the end.' "</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Though the Twins were blown out from the start Wednesday, there
were at least two things worth salvaging from the loss.</TE>
<TE>   The first? "Nobody got hurt, except our feelings," Minnesota
Manager Ron Gardenhire said. "We kind of got waxed, but I guess if
you're going to get beat, you might as well get waxed."</TE>
<TE>   The second? The underdog Twins earned a split of the first two
games in Oakland and can win the series by sweeping two games in the
Metrodome, where they went 54-27 this season.</TE>
<TE>   "No one in the world thought we'd win one game here, and we got
one," Twin first baseman Doug Mientkiewicz said. "Now, we get to go
home and play in front of 60,000 screaming fans, waving homer hankies
... we're built for that park, and we need to take advantage of it."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Oakland reserve first baseman Olmedo Saenz underwent surgery to
repair a ruptured Achilles' tendon Wednesday and will miss the
remainder of the postseason. The A's will not be able to replace him
on the playoff roster until the second round, if they advance....
After breaking only three bats during the regular season, Long broke
three bats Tuesday and another Wednesday.</TE>

<HD>Royster Fired as Brewer Manager</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Jerry Royster knew he was out as manager of the Milwaukee Brewers
after last week's front-office shakeup.</LD>
<LD>   The official firing came Wednesday and made Royster the sixth
major league manager to lose his job in the last four days.</LD>
<LD>   Doug Melvin replaced Dean Taylor as Brewer general manager last
week as part of the changes that included Wendy Selig-Prieb stepping
down as president.</LD>
<TE>   "I don't have any problem with what Doug's doing, I think it's the
right thing to do," Royster said. "A general manager has to hire his
own guy. If I were Doug, I'd fire me, too."</TE>
<TE>   Melvin said his search for a replacement would begin with Jerry
Narron, who was fired by the Texas Rangers on Tuesday, and Buck
Showalter, former manager of the Arizona Diamondbacks, but that he
wanted to include an array of candidates.</TE>
<TE>   The Brewers had the National League's worst record at 56-106 and
finished 41 games behind the Central Division-winning St. Louis
Cardinals.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The woman accused of extortion by New York Met pitcher Grant
Roberts financially supported him while he played in the minor
leagues, her lawyer said.</TE>
<TE>   Jodi Turner gave Roberts money, paid his rent and bought various
items "for a significant period of time" in the late 1990s, lawyer
Stephen Scaring said, Newsday reported Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   "We're talking everything," Scaring said. "When he needed money,
he called her and she gave it to him."</TE>
<TE>   Roberts and agent Seth Levinson have said Turner tried to extort
money from him before releasing a 1998 picture that appeared in
Newsday showing the pitcher smoking marijuana. An accompanying
article said at least seven Mets have used marijuana this season.</TE>
<TE>   Roberts was scheduled to meet with prosecutors in Queens on
Tuesday, but the meeting was postponed.</TE>

<TE>   The Seattle Mariners signed catcher and infielder Chao Kuan Wu to
a minor league contract, the organization's first player from Taiwan.</TE>

played on Taiwan's Little League World Series title team in 1996.</TE>

<HD>Giants Are Relieved to Win the Opener</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JASON REID</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>ATLANTA</DL>
<LD>The situation unfolded as the Atlanta Braves envisioned when they got
Gary Sheffield to help exorcise their demons of Octobers past.</LD>
<LD>   Everything except the ending.</LD>
<LD>   Sheffield hit a towering home run to energize the Braves'
late-inning efforts, but he failed with the spotlight on him again,
and the San Francisco Giants held on for an 8-5 victory Wednesday in
Game 1 of a National League division series at Turner Field.</LD>
<TE>   Representing the tying run in the ninth with fans chanting his
name, Sheffield, one of baseball's top clutch hitters, grounded into
a game-ending double play against closer Robb Nen, enabling the
Giants to finally finish off the Braves before what remained of a
crowd of 41,903.</TE>
<TE>   "That's the situation I like to be in; that's the situation I want
to be in," said Sheffield, acquired in a January trade with the
Dodgers. "I like my chances when I'm up there, but he's their best
pitcher and they beat us with their best."</TE>
<TE>   The Giants knew they had dodged a bullet.</TE>
<TE>   "Sheff is not one of the guys you want to see if you're the
opposing team," said Giant outfielder Tom Goodwin, who played with
Sheffield in Los Angeles. "We weren't excited to see him walk up
there. On the other hand, that's what baseball is all about: your
best against their best. Fortunately, Robby was able to put out the
fire."</TE>
<TE>   The Braves' flame only flickered for most of the day.</TE>
<TE>   The stands began to empty as the Giants seemingly broke the game
open with two runs in the sixth, taking an 8-2 lead. Giant
right-hander Russ Ortiz was cruising in only his second playoff
start, and two-time Cy Young Award winner Tom Glavine, who shares the
record for postseason victories with teammate John Smoltz, was chased
after only five innings in one of his worst performances on this
stage.</TE>
<TE>   But the Braves scored three runs in the eighth against setup man
Tim Worrell on Sheffield's 415-foot solo shot and a two-run homer by
Javy Lopez, after an error by catcher Benito Santiago, to make things
interesting in the ninth.</TE>
<TE>   Mark De Rosa walked leading off against Nen, Rafael Furcal singled
and Giant right fielder Reggie Sanders made a running catch on Julio
Franco's slicing line drive to right-center with Sheffield on deck.
Sheffield grounded a 1-and-2 slider to shortstop Rich Aurilia, and
the Giants took the opener of the best-of-five series despite getting
only a single from Barry Bonds, who was one for four with a walk,
though he was robbed of a homer in the eighth by center fielder
Andruw Jones.</TE>
<TE>   Every member of the Giant starting lineup had at least one hit,
including Ortiz, one of baseball's best hitting pitchers, who worked
seven strong innings for the first playoff victory of his career.</TE>
<TE>   "This means a great deal, especially being able to help the team
get a win the first game out," said Ortiz, a 14-game winner during
the season. "You have to respect and appreciate what Glavine has done
in the playoffs. He's a great playoff pitcher and the ballclub did a
great job."</TE>
<TE>   J.T. Snow, Aurilia and Santiago (three hits) each contributed
two-run doubles in a 12-hit attack. David Bell had two hits and
knocked in a run, and leadoff batter Kenny Lofton reached base twice,
scored and drove in a run.</TE>
<TE>   "Everybody thinks all the time about Barry, but the guys who hurt
you are the guys nobody mentions," Lopez said. "In this case, Bell,
Benito and Aurilia ... they were the ones who got the big hits."</TE>
<TE>   It was exactly the type of heart-racing game Giant Manager Dusty
Baker expected, because that's the way his bunch plays.</TE>
<TE>   "Exciting ballgame down to the end," said Baker, whose club held
off the Dodgers for the NL wild-card berth. "You know, we haven't had
an easy game in a month, so I propose we play that kind of game
throughout the playoffs."</TE>
<TE>   The East-champion Braves won't be in the playoffs much longer if
another starter pitches as poorly as Glavine did.</TE>
<TE>   The left-hander gave up 10 hits and six earned runs. San Francisco
took a 3-0 lead in the second on Snow's double and Bell's single and
extended its advantage to 6-2 in the fourth.</TE>
<TE>   Glavine accounted for the Braves' two runs in the second, cueing a
two-out, bases-loaded single down the left-field line for the fourth
and fifth playoff RBIs of his career. The 18-game winner would have
gladly traded them for a better outcome on the mound.</TE>
<TE>   "I really can't put my finger on a whole lot," Glavine said. "The
results just weren't what I wanted."</TE>
<TE>   Sheffield can relate.</TE>
<TE>   "It didn't happen today," he said, "but I feel like good things
are going to come."</TE>

<HD>Maddux's Blister Changes Rotation</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jason Reid</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>ATLANTA</DL>
<LD>Greg Maddux's blister problem prompted the Atlanta Braves to alter
their pitching plans with the team trailing, 1-0, in the best-of-five
series.</LD>
<LD>   The four-time Cy Young Award winner, scheduled to start Game 2
today, has been bumped to Game 3 on Saturday in San Francisco,
switching places with fellow right-hander Kevin Millwood because of a
blister on the index finger of his pitching hand. Giant left-hander
Kirk Rueter faces Millwood today, and right-hander Jason Schmidt is
scheduled to start Game 3 at Pacific Bell Park.</LD>
<LD>   Although Maddux said he was able to pitch, Manager Bobby Cox said
he needs at least two days' extra rest to help the blister heal.
Maddux said he probably could not come back on three days' rest to
start in a possible Game 5 because of his blister.</LD>
<TE>   "Do I feel confident that I can go out there? Yes I do," Maddux
said. "Do I feel I could come back a day early if I had to? That's
where the concern is."</TE>
<TE>   Maddux said the blister affects all of his pitches except the
changeup.</TE>
<TE>   Millwood, who last pitched Friday against the New York Mets, is
fine with the move that keeps him on normal rest and puts him in a
big situation.</TE>
<TE>   "We know we definitely can't take these guys lightly," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "We all know what we have to do, it's just a matter of going out
and doing it now."</TE>

<HD>Officials Disciplined by Big Ten</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Big Ten Conference disciplined four officials Wednesday after
determining they did a poor job during a Sept. 21 game between Wake
Forest and Purdue.</LD>
<LD>   "During the course of the game, these officials did not officiate
well enough to meet Big Ten standards," Big Ten Commissioner Jim
Delany said in a statement. "Therefore, they will forfeit future
officiating assignments."</LD>
<LD>   A spokesman at the Big Ten's office in Park Ridge, Ill., would not
comment on what specific mistakes the crew made during the game,
which Wake Forest won, 24-21.</LD>
<TE>   Purdue Coach Joe Tiller said he was glad conference officials
reviewed the game.</TE>
<TE>   "In competitive athletics, everyone is held accountable," Tiller
said. "And it's encouraging to know that they are holding officials
accountable, too."</TE>
<TE>   Tiller would not discuss specific calls on Wednesday, but the
Indianapolis Star reported that his staff zeroed in on two calls: A
holding penalty that nullified a 67-yard run by the Boilermakers'
Joey Harris and an interference call against Purdue's Stuart
Schweigert on what was thought to be an uncatchable pass. The last
call was on the Demon Deacons' game-winning drive.</TE>
<TE>   A seven-man crew worked the game, and four of those officials are
listed on the Big Ten's officiating staff. They are referee Daniel
Capron, linesman Steve Beckman, back judge Scott Buchanan and side
judge Don Swanson.</TE>
<TE>   The Big Ten would not confirm that those were the four who were
disciplined. The conference also would not say how many games the
officials would miss.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Joe Paterno will not be punished for grabbing the referee Dick
Honig after Penn State's overtime loss to Iowa, Big Ten spokesman
Scott Chipman said.</TE>
<TE>   Paterno was upset over two calls against Penn State in overtime.
When the game ended, Paterno sprinted down the field and grabbed
Honing as he was headed to the locker room.</TE>
<TE>   "All I did was try to stop him because he was running ahead of
me," Paterno said. "I was running to the locker room, I grabbed him
by the shirt and I said 'Hey, Dick, you had two lousy calls.' Not he,
I said the two guys on the other side had two lousy calls."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Notre Dame is 4-0 in the eyes of the bowl championship series
after all. Reversing a decision made less than two weeks ago, the BCS
said that the Fighting Irish's victory over Maryland in the Kickoff
Classic will count toward qualifying for a BCS game.</TE>
<TE>   The change means the Irish are five victories from qualifying for
one of two at-large berths for the four BCS games. Under BCS rules,
teams must have nine '"nonexempt" victories to earn a chance to play
in a BCS game.</TE>
<TE>   Until this season, the first 19 Kickoff Classics, along with all
the other "preseason classic" games, were considered "exempt."
However, since the date of the Notre Dame-Maryland game was changed
to Aug. 31 from Aug. 24, it took place after the NCAA's window of
exempt games.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Ohio State running back Maurice Clarett may not be scared of
300-pound defensive tackles, but he is scared of flying.</TE>
<TE>   He's so afraid of flying, the freshman says he'll drive to the
Fiesta Bowl in Tempe, Ariz., if Ohio State makes it all the way to
the BCS title game.</TE>
<TE>   "How do they know where they're going up in the clouds? There
ain't no stop signs, no stop lights, nothing like that," he said of
airline pilots. "It's kind of crazy, man. Seriously."</TE>
<TE>   The freshman has flown only once, to an all-star game in Texas in
January. His next flight comes Friday when the No. 5 Buckeyes (5-0)
travel to Evanston, Ill., to play Northwestern.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The parents of former Florida State player Devaughn Darling sued
the school, claiming their son died after complaining of dizziness
and chest pains during a workout. Darling was 18 when he collapsed
and died Feb. 26, 2001, of an apparent "cardiac arrhythmia." He was
penciled in as a starting outside linebacker entering spring
practices.... Fred Russell, one of the nation's leading rushers, has
been granted an extra year of eligibility for a shoulder injury that
sidelined him in his freshman year at Iowa. Russell will have two
years of eligibility left after this season.</TE>

<HD>Diamondbacks Need Schilling to Be Money</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>Newsday</BD>
<DL>PHOENIX</DL>
<LD>He has the right arm and the right attitude for the job. More
significantly, in the eyes of his teammates, Curt Schilling has the
right stuff to square the National League division series when the
Diamondbacks play host to the St. Louis Cardinals at Bank One
Ballpark today.</LD>
<LD>   To think otherwise would be to concede that the end is near.</LD>
<LD>   "Curt is the best big-game pitcher of our era," Arizona first
baseman Mark Grace said Wednesday. "If I had to stake my life on one
pitcher in a big game, it would be him."</LD>
<TE>   In effect, all the Diamondbacks are staking their baseball
lives--or at least the defense of their world championship--on a man
who won all four of his postseason decisions a year ago and, in the
words of his manager, relishes the spotlight.</TE>
<TE>   Randy Johnson, the left-handed half of baseball's most formidable
pitching partnership, provided Schilling with little margin for error
when he was hammered by the Cardinals on Tuesday night. Johnson
lasted six innings and was battered for a season-high 10 hits,
including two homers, a triple and a double in a 12-2 loss.</TE>
<TE>   Under the circumstances, the best possible scenario for Arizona is
to win today and take a 1-1 split to St. Louis, where the series
resumes Saturday. That's how the series unfolded a year ago and the
Diamondbacks emerged from the first round of the playoffs on a
ninth-inning single by Tony Womack in Game 5.</TE>
<TE>   "To go out of here down 2-0," Schilling decided with profound
understatement, "would not be conducive to us getting to the next
round."</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, it would not. Although St. Louis pitching coach Dave
Duncan declared that Arizona's third-game starter, Miguel Batista, is
"no day at the beach," it's no secret that the Diamondbacks rely
heavily on the front end of their rotation. Johnson and Schilling's
postseason records were a combined 9-1 last fall; the rest of the
staff was 2-5. Whereas the Big Two were 47-12 during the regular
season this year, none of the other starters had a winning record.
Batista finished 8-9.</TE>
<TE>   The Cardinals know full well what Schilling can do. He beat them
twice in the postseason last year, yielding one run in 18 innings.
Still, his career record against St. Louis in the regular season is a
subpar 5-9, and that includes two defeats in as many decisions this
season. Just last week, Scott Rolen and J.D. Drew hit three-run
homers in a 6-1 victory over Schilling at Busch Stadium. It was the
last of several uncharacteristic outings that probably cost him the
Cy Young Award, likely to be won for the fourth consecutive season by
Johnson.</TE>
<TE>   Nothing less than Schilling's best may do against the Cardinals.
"It's probably as good a lineup as I'll ever face, top to bottom,"
Schilling said.</TE>
<TE>   Arizona will face left-hander Chuck Finley, who won seven of 11
decisions after the Cardinals acquired him from the Indians in
mid-summer. His goal is to keep his team in the game.</TE>
<TE>   Schilling has grander designs. "We've got to go out and play a
flawless game," he said. "Mediocre performances are not optional at
this time of the year."</TE>

<HD>Girlfriend Feared for Life</HD>
<DH>Mystery: Wiese believed Dabord might try to kill her
because he had told her too much about Dele.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LANCE PUGMIRE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>She wants to believe his story about the disappearance of his
brother, former basketball star Bison Dele, and two others off
Tahiti.</LD>
<LD>   But after nearly a month spent agonizing over Miles Dabord's
version of events, and learning more about the allegations he was
facing when he apparently committed suicide, Erica Wiese has come to
interpret her former boyfriend's actions as those of someone "acting
in survival mode."</LD>
<LD>   In her first extended interview since reporting Dabord's account
to the FBI on Sept. 10, Wiese, 31, said she wants to clarify her
involvement with Dabord and let people know, "that I have told
everything I know about this; I'm an open book."</LD>
<TE>   "I think he was in a fight with [Dele] that ended ugly," Wiese
said by telephone from her home in Northern California late Tuesday
night. "Did he say to himself, 'I've got witnesses, now I have to
take care of them?' Probably. Why the gold? I think he was going to
do what he could to escape.... Once he gave up on that, he
overdosed."</TE>
<TE>   Law enforcement officials believe Dabord killed his brother, along
with Dele's girlfriend, Serena Kaplan, and boat captain Bertrand
Saldo, while at sea on July 7. The next day, Dabord met Wiese on the
island of Moorea, near Tahiti, and he was with her until she returned
home on July 15.</TE>
<TE>   Dabord, also known as Kevin Williams (his brother's given name was
Brian Williams, which is what he went by for much of his eight-year
career in the NBA) died at a hospital in Chula Vista, Calif., last
week after being taken off a respirator. He was found, comatose and
nearly naked, in Mexico and was transported to the U.S. on Sept. 15.
His mother, Patricia Phillips, said Dabord died as the result of an
insulin overdose combined with his not taking asthma medication.</TE>
<TE>   While the FBI and authorities in French Polynesia wanted to
question him about the disappearances on his brother's boat, Dabord
was also being hunted by Phoenix police for skipping bail in
connection with his allegedly trying to buy $152,000 in gold using
his brother's identification as his own on Sept 5.</TE>
<TE>   Wiese said Dabord showed up at the Bay Area high-tech company
where she works on Sept. 6, telling her of his failed gold purchase
and the reason he attempted it.</TE>
<TE>   "At first, he said, 'I came to tell you I'm leaving, I'm in
trouble,' " Wiese said. "Then he said, 'I need to help Bison out,
he's in trouble. It's about a missing person; there's been an
accident and I need to get Bison money--gold, because it's the
portable currency.' "</TE>
<TE>   Wiese said Dabord confided that Karlan had died--and that he was
considering suicide because of how the failed gold purchase would
make him appear guilty once her death was discovered.</TE>
<TE>   Dabord, Wiese added, was fearful that he was being followed by law
enforcement officials and wanted to stay in a Bay Area hotel that
night, then drive to Mexico the next day to obtain, "medicine you
can't get here."</TE>
<TE>   On the morning of Sept. 7, Wiese said she and Dabord awoke in the
hotel room and cried together for more than an hour. She sobbed while
retelling the story: "When you've got a man crying in your arms,
telling you he wants to spend the last hours of his life with you....
I just wanted to be there for him. We were in love."</TE>
<TE>   They drove to a motel in San Ysidro, Calif., near the Mexican
border, where Dabord detailed his account of the three deaths that
evening. Wiese said she awoke the next morning, Sept. 8, fearful that
she might be in danger because of her knowledge about the deaths.</TE>
<TE>   "I just want to go home," Wiese told Dabord. "I know too much."</TE>
<TE>   She then drove back to Palo Alto, taking a call from Dabord to her
cell phone along the way. He had crossed into Mexico. That was the
last she said she heard from him.</TE>
<TE>   That night, she said she slept on her couch--a knife and a
telephone within arm's reach.</TE>
<TE>   "I'd be lying if I said I didn't think about a scenario where
Miles would be saying to himself, 'Holy ..., I've told someone about
this, I have to take care of it,' " Wiese said. "That's why I slept
with the knife. It was a worst-case scenario."</TE>
<TE>   The FBI does not consider Wiese an accomplice to Dabord, but
others, including Kevin Porter, Dele's personal assistant, regard her
as a potentially key witness.</TE>
<TE>   "From July 8, when Erica arrived in Tahiti to vacation with Miles,
to Sept. 7, when she has said Miles told her exactly what happened,
that's about 60 days," Porter said. "You're trying to tell me Miles
didn't say anything about this to her between then? This is what
keeps me up at night."</TE>
<TE>   Wiese said this was Dabord's account of what happened on the boat:
He and Bison were fighting--a combination of past frictions--when
Karlan was fatally injured while trying to intercede. Saldo was
killed by Dele because the captain wanted to report Karlan's death to
authorities. The fight with Dele continued after Saldo was killed,
leading Dabord to shoot and kill Dele in self-defense. Dabord said he
then weighted the three bodies and dumped them overboard.</TE>
<TE>   "I just listened," Wiese said, "in shock."</TE>
<TE>   Wiese repeated Dabord's account to a Sonoma County sheriff on the
night of Sept. 9. At first, she said, the detective asked, "Can this
wait until tomorrow?" She said it couldn't.</TE>
<TE>   Later, she got a call back. "Yeah, this checks out," she was told.
"The FBI wants to talk to you."</TE>
<TE>   French Polynesian authorities still do. While waiting for analysis
on possible blood stains and hull damage from Dele's boat--results
aren't expected back for two weeks--they have asked the U.S.
Department of Justice for permission to interview Wiese later this
month.</TE>
<TE>   Wiese met Dabord through mutual friends about two years ago. "I
liked several qualities about him," she said. "He was extremely
intelligent and intriguing; he knew a lot about the world and he had
a good sense of humor. I've seen a lot of articles about Miles, and
some have painted him as a monster. The Miles I knew was soft-spoken,
fun to be around, a teddy bear."</TE>
<TE>   But she has also learned that something Dabord often said--that he
was a partner with Dele in several holding companies--was untrue.
Wiese said she has concluded Dabord was unemployed.</TE>
<TE>   "We did argue quite a bit over the fact that I didn't think he was
doing a lot with himself," Wiese said.</TE>
<TE>   Dabord was living in San Francisco in January when he informed
Wiese of his plans to join Dele in New Zealand.</TE>
<TE>   "It took him a while to find Bison, about three weeks, but Miles
had told me he wanted it to work out with Bison, because he had no
other family," Wiese said.</TE>
<TE>   Dabord stayed into April, upsetting Wiese, especially as he
reported "constant quarrels with Bison."</TE>
<TE>   "I'd ask him how Bison was and Miles would say his moods changed a
lot," Wiese said. "He told me Bison was smoking pot every day. It
just sounded like they were both going through mood swings. They were
both extremely intelligent, extremely opinionated and unconventional
in their thinking. You could see how they'd clash."</TE>
<TE>   Dabord returned to the Bay Area in April for two weeks, living
with Wiese. He informed her he'd be going back to New Zealand for a
sail to Tahiti. She resisted the idea, but Dabord said he'd pay for
her to join him once he reached the French Polynesian islands.</TE>
<TE>   Wiese said she booked her vacation at Tahiti's neighboring island,
Moorea, nearly a month before her July 8 arrival. She said her last
conversation with Dabord before leaving the Bay Area was on July 5, a
talk she said revolved around where they would meet in Moorea.</TE>
<TE>   Wiese said she met Dabord at a resort on the island, spotting him
as he rode a personal watercraft that was usually attached to Dele's
boat. The boat, she said, was docked two coves over. They spent only
one night aboard the boat.</TE>
<TE>   Wiese said when she asked where Dele, Karlan and Saldo were,
Dabord told her Dele and Karlan were on another island, Raiatea, that
was a three-day sail away. Saldo, he said, was busy with friends in
Moorea.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't have a desire to meet Bison," Wiese said. "From Miles'
point of view, it sounded like Bison was treating Miles [poorly].
Miles even said to me once, 'If I ever keep going on and on and on to
make a point, please stop me--because that's what Bison does.' "</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Wiese and Dabord were having their own problems. She
said four days into the trip Dabord said he wanted to break up,
declaring, "we have nothing in common."</TE>
<TE>   "I felt like what was happening with us was only because of things
he was directing at me," Wiese said. "We had been separated for about
six months. He was a bit more distant than usual. I had the sense he
had other things on his mind, like he didn't care if he spent time
with me.</TE>
<TE>   "We got in a big argument. That broke my heart. But I had no
reason to question his behavior on anything else. If he was acting
different, I thought it was only because of us."</TE>
<TE>   The FBI has interviewed a woman Dabord sailed with in New Zealand.
He placed a six-minute phone call to her from the boat at 3:58 p.m.
on July 7. A law enforcement official said the details of the
conversation were "routine."</TE>
<TE>   Wiese said she asked Dabord if he had been unfaithful to her
during the trip. She was told no. "But don't think I didn't think
about it," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Yet Wiese said her trip to Moorea ended July 15 on an encouraging
note, with Dabord telling her, "We just need to start over."</TE>
<TE>   She returned home without him--Dabord said he had to repair the
water-logged personal watercraft--but he was back with her in the Bay
Area by July 20.</TE>
<TE>   Wiese said Dabord reverted to "acting like a dream boyfriend." But
that behavior was short-lived too.</TE>
<TE>   Wiese said Dabord was frequently using the Internet and talking of
buying his own business. Most troubling to Wiese was Dabord's heavy
beer drinking.</TE>
<TE>   Said Wiese: "I asked him why he was drinking so much, and he said,
'You don't know the stress I'm under. I'm trying to find out what to
do with the rest of my life.' "</TE>
<TE>   She knows that kind of stress now.</TE>
<TE>   "This has emotionally screwed me up," Wiese said. "I don't want to
be out here trying to explain this. I've lost a person I cared about.
I've been lied to. I've got a lot of baggage with this. And what
makes me upset is to hear people say they think I'm holding things
back. I wanted to stand by my man. I'll always love him. But I also
have to consider the things I've been told.</TE>
<TE>   "That's why I ask myself: Was I a sucker?"</TE>

<LD>Nebraska is not the first major college football dynasty to fall on
tough times.</LD>
<LD>   In fact, Nebraska is the very last, which raises the question,
what took so long?</LD>
<LD>   Of the 10 winningest programs of all time, Nebraska is the only
one that has avoided a downturn in the last 40 years.</LD>
<TE>   We looked it up:</TE>
<TE>   1. Michigan: Consecutive 4-6 seasons in 1965 and '66, four
consecutive four-loss seasons in the mid-1990s, finished unranked in
1995.</TE>
<TE>   2. Notre Dame: Forget Gerry Faust, the Irish have had losing
seasons two out of the last three years.</TE>
<TE>   3. Nebraska: Forty consecutive winning seasons, 33 consecutive
bowl game appearances, 33 consecutive seasons of nine wins or more.</TE>
<TE>   4. Texas: Finished 4-7 in 1997, endured David McWilliams in the
1980s. A few years ago, when Texas Athletic Director DeLoss Dodds
asked a prominent national writer why he had not visited Austin in 20
years, the writer said, You tell me.</TE>
<TE>   5. Alabama: Finished 3-8 in 2000, 4-7 in '97, 5-6 in '84.</TE>
<TE>   6. Penn State: Trying to rebound from consecutive losing seasons
for the first time in the Joe Paterno era.</TE>
<TE>   7. Ohio State: Finished 7-5 last year, 6-6 in 1999 and 4-6-1 in
1988.</TE>
<TE>   8. Tennessee: Before Phillip Fulmer, Volunteers had a 5-6 season
in 1988, went 5-6 in 1980 and 5-5-1 in '78.</TE>
<TE>   9. Oklahoma: School with seven national titles posted five
consecutive nonwinning seasons from 1994-98.</TE>
<TE>   10. USC: Basically a .500 program since the 1996 Rose Bowl, with
four nonwinning seasons since.</TE>
<TE>   Among the more recent dynasties, Miami, five-time national
champion since 1983, had to fight back from a 5-6 season in 1997.</TE>
<TE>   Florida State, almost astonishingly, finished in the top five
every year since 1987 until last year's four-loss catastrophe.</TE>
<TE>   Program blips have beset every dominant program in recent history
except Nebraska.</TE>
<TE>   Until now.</TE>
<TE>   The once-mighty Husker Nation is in apparent tatters, the team an
unpardonable 3-2 after a 22-point road loss to Iowa State. The
Cornhuskers dropped out of the Associated Press poll for the first
time in 348 football weeks, are 5-4 since their 20-10 victory over
Oklahoma last year and have been blown out in their last four games
played away from Lincoln.</TE>
<TE>   College football's most seamless program, an heirloom passed from
coach Bob Devaney to Tom Osborne to Frank Solich, now has a few
busted seams.</TE>
<TE>   There is terrified talk in Lincoln that Nebraska might lose at
home Saturday to McNeese State, actually the only ranked team playing
in the game (No. 2 in the latest Division I-AA ).</TE>
<TE>   "We need to start moving forward again," Solich, now in his fifth
season, said this week. "We need to improve in almost every aspect of
the game."</TE>
<TE>   It's incredible how fast Nebraska was toppled, given the school
played in last year's national title game, but even then there were
warning signals: The Cornhuskers somehow qualified for the game after
giving up 62 points to Colorado and then surrendered 37 to Miami in
the Rose Bowl.</TE>
<TE>   This year, the Cornhuskers have become truly mediocre, entering
play this week ranked 76th on offense and 63rd on defense.</TE>
<TE>   Some are surprised the Nebraska football miracle has lasted this
long.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it's inevitable, and I don't think anybody can feel
they're immune to that," Arizona Coach John Mackovic said this week
of the Cornhuskers' decline.</TE>
<TE>   Mackovic knows. He was coach at Texas in 1996 when the Longhorns
shocked Nebraska in the Big 12 Conference title game.</TE>
<TE>   Mackovic says the reality of scholarship limits finally caught up
with the Big Red Machine.</TE>
<TE>   What's gone wrong in Lincoln is the subject of heated debate, and
centers on a few fronts:</TE>
<TE>   * The offensive line, long the engine of Nebraska's machine, got
caught in a numbers crunch. Toniu Fonoti, the team's superstar guard,
left early for the NFL--he was San Diego's second-round pick. John
Dawson, a potential starter, was kicked off the team and Chris Loos
was lost to a potential career-ending knee injury.</TE>
<TE>   * Jammal Lord was not ready to step in for Eric Crouch at
quarterback. Lord, a junior, had little time to develop behind
Crouch, last year's Heisman Trophy winner, and his performance has
suffered to the point he may be benched this week and replaced by
sophomore Mike Stuntz. Solich acknowledged the switch to Lord "has
not worked real well."</TE>
<TE>   * The Nebraska defense, the once-feared Black Shirts, have been
more red-faced this season. The potential scapegoat here is defensive
coordinator Craig Bohl, in his third year since replacing the retired
Charlie McBride.</TE>
<TE>   The situation in Lincoln is close to meltdown. A local writer
described the community reaction as a "freak show." A sampling of
Omaha World-Herald's Internet site message-board postings sums up the
mood:</TE>
<TE>   "This program is in the midst of being in ruins"--Colorado Corn.</TE>
<TE>   "Pathetic. Thanks Frank for making us a laughing stock"--QB
choice.</TE>
<TE>   "Better pull it together or McNeese State will bring the program
to an all-time low."--Vegas Husker.</TE>
<TE>   "Fire Bohl! Fire Solich! Fire [Athletic Director Bill] Byrne! Get
rid of them all! Save the Big Red"--Corn Cob Nation.</TE>
<TE>   For the record, Solich's 45-11 record in Lincoln works out to a
winning percentage of .804, but Nebraska fans have been spoiled like
no others.</TE>
<TE>   Should Nebraska finish 8-4 or, heaven forbid, 7-5, Solich may be
forced to shake up a coaching staff build for years on loyalty and
stability.</TE>
<TE>   Times vs. Times</TE>
<TE>   No one will ever compare the Seattle Times with the New York
Times, but we give Seattle the news context award this week.</TE>
<TE>   The New York Times garnered national news attention when it
trumped the release of its first computer ranking, which had Notre
Dame at No. 1 and USC No. 2.</TE>
<TE>   With much less fanfare, the Anderson-Hester/Seattle Times rankings
also premiered with Notre Dame at No. 1.</TE>
<TE>   Both the New York and Seattle Times' computer rankings are among
seven used in the bowl championship series standings, which determine
the two teams that play in this year's national title game.</TE>
<TE>   Chris Hester, half of the team that tabulates the Anderson-Hester
ranking, said not much should be made of rankings released in early
October.</TE>
<TE>   "I think computer rankings at this point in the season are
interesting, but not overly reliable to determine the end results
simply because there are so many significant games left to be
played," Hester said.</TE>
<TE>   For what it's worth, USC is No. 15 in the first Seattle Times
ranking.</TE>
<TE>   The only BCS computer ranking that hasn't published yet is Los
Angeles-based Peter Wolfe. Of the six computer s released, USC has an
average ranking of No. 12.</TE>
<TE>   Under BCS rules, however, USC's worst ranking, No. 33 in Richard
Billingsley, would be discarded, leaving the Trojans with a 6.5
average.</TE>
<TE>   Hurry-Up Offense</TE>
<TE>   Run of the year so far in college football? No disrespect to the
kids, but we're going with 75-year-old Joe Paterno's postgame sprint
toward official Dick Honig in the aftermath of Penn State's 42-35
overtime loss to Iowa. Paterno's closing speed, frankly, was
remarkable and makes you think JoePa might coach into his 80s. When a
reporter on this week's Big Ten coaches' teleconference call asked
Paterno for his sprint time, the coach remarked, "Faster than yours,
I know that."</TE>
<TE>   Paterno's blood and legs were pumping because he felt officials
had blown at least two calls in the game, the most important coming
in overtime when a referee ruled receiver Tony Johnson out of bounds
on what appeared to be a catch. After Paterno reached Honig, he
grabbed the official to get his attention. Interestingly, Paterno did
not apologize for making contact with the official and the Big Ten
Conference did not issue a reprimand. "Contact?" Paterno said. "I
just stopped him. I didn't want to knock him over. If it had been a
reporter, I probably would have knocked him over."</TE>
<TE>   David Parry, the Big Ten's supervisor of officials, told the
Chicago Tribune that Honig did not take exception to Paterno's
approach. "According to Dick Honig, there was nothing that crossed
the line," Parry said. "There was nothing vicious or hateful."</TE>
<TE>   In other words, this was not Woody Hayes punching a Clemson
player.</TE>
<TE>   Tommy Bowden gets another shot at dad tonight when Clemson (3-1)
meets Florida State (4-1) at Tallahassee in Bowden Bowl IV.</TE>
<TE>   When Tommy faced Bobby in 1999 it was historic, the first time in
major college football a son coached against his dad. That game was a
thriller, Florida State rallying from a 14-3 deficit to win, 17-14.</TE>
<TE>   The last two games have been Florida State blowouts, leaving Tommy
with an 0-3 record against his famous father. Tommy's chances for a
victory didn't improve after Florida State lost to Louisville last
week.</TE>
<TE>   "I know he is upset after losing to Louisville," Tommy said.
"There is no doubt what little chance we had of them looking past us
is gone. Had they beaten Louisville, they might have looked ahead a
bit to Miami and Notre Dame."</TE>
<TE>   The rain-soaked overtime loss to Louisville dropped Florida State
from No. 4 to No. 11 in the polls and means the Seminoles must win
their remaining games to stay in the national title race. Some wonder
if sophomore quarterback Chris Rix is capable of taking up this
charge. His interception in overtime led to Louisville's victory, and
one Seminole has already grumbled publicly about Rix's decision
making.</TE>
<TE>   Yet, there is only one opinion that matters. "I have not lost
confidence in Chris and I have not lost patience in him," Bowden
said.</TE>
<TE>   More on Bobby: You have to wonder how many more Louisville-type
losses the 72-year-old legend can take. After last week's loss, the
Florida State plane did not return to Tallahassee until 5 a.m. Friday
morning, after which Bowden taped his weekly television show.</TE>
<TE>   What was that like? "If you ever see it, you'll know," Bowden
said. "You'll say, 'Why don't he know their names?' It's because he's
sleeping between the commercials."</TE>

<HD>Galaxy Kicks It Up a Notch</HD>
<DH>Soccer: Jones and Ruiz score twice as L.A. defeats Kansas
City, 5-2, to reach the MLS semifinals.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PAUL GUTIERREZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Call it the Cobi and Carlos Show.</LD>
<LD>   And, for the Galaxy and its fans, the extravaganza's engagement
will last at least another round of Major League Soccer's playoffs.</LD>
<LD>   Cobi Jones, the Galaxy's most venerable and accomplished player,
and Carlos Ruiz, the wildly popular first-year scoring sensation from
Guatemala, both made sure of it Wednesday night at the Rose Bowl.
Both players had two goals and an assist in the Galaxy's 5-2 win over
the Kansas City Wizards in the deciding Game 3 of their first-round
series.</LD>
<TE>   With the win, the Galaxy advances to the semifinals against
Colorado--which scored in the first minute of a sudden-death series
tiebreaker to defeat Dallas--beginning Saturday at the Rose Bowl at 7
p.m.</TE>
<TE>   But before preparing for the Rapids, who went 2-2-0 against the
Galaxy this year, Jones wanted to soak in the moment. So he laid at
midfield for about 10 minutes after the final whistle blew and caught
his breath.</TE>
<TE>   "This was really important, especially for our self-worth as a
team," Jones said, reflecting on the Galaxy's blowout win four days
after being blown out, 4-1, at Kansas City, a postseason loss that
equaled a franchise-worst.</TE>
<TE>   "They took it to us there and we took it to them here."</TE>
<TE>   It wouldn't have been possible without his running mate Ruiz,
though.</TE>
<TE>   "We're the guys the team needs to lean on offensively and in the
playoffs, it's time to show your worth. It's very sweet and this is
what we need heading into the next series."</TE>
<TE>   The Western Conference champion and No. 1-seeded Galaxy, which has
been in the playoffs every year since the league's inception in 1996,
also avoided the dubious distinction of becoming the first team to
finish the regular season with the best record, yet get knocked out
in the first round of the playoffs.</TE>
<TE>   The Galaxy had been tight and tentative in the first two games of
the series, in which Kansas City scored first in each.</TE>
<TE>   In front of 14,713 at the Rose Bowl, things were different.</TE>
<TE>   The Galaxy broke through in the 34th minute when Ruiz scored off a
free kick from about 20 yards out.</TE>
<TE>   The kicks was set up after Alejandro Moreno was fouled on a
breakaway attempt by Wizard defender Carey Talley.</TE>
<TE>   Ruiz lightly tapped the ball on the free kick to Sasha Victorine,
who fed the ball back to Ruiz on his right.</TE>
<TE>   The quick give-and-go opened up just enough space in the Wizard
defensive wall for Ruiz to lace his powerful shot through it and past
a diving Tony Meola.</TE>
<TE>   The Galaxy made it 2-0 in the second minute of extra time to close
out the first half.</TE>
<TE>   With Kansas City midfielder Diego Gutierrez trying to juggle the
ball in the penalty box in an apparent, and unwise, attempt to clear
it out with a bicycle kick, an onrushing Jones stole the ball from
him. After one dribble off his chest, Jones' shot blew by Meola.</TE>
<TE>   "Getting that first goal does a lot of things [for momentum],"
Galaxy Coach Sigi Schmid said. "And getting the second goal right
before the half is an adrenaline giver."</TE>
<TE>   Kansas City's Chris Klein got the Wizards within one in the 47th
minute, but Jones scored 15 minutes later when he followed Ruiz's
shot off the post and deposited the ball into the net for his third
goal of the series.</TE>
<TE>   The Galaxy went up, 4-1, in the 66th minute when Ruiz, after
taking a long pass from Jones, juked defender Nick Garcia on the
right side and beat Meola again.</TE>
<TE>   "I connect pretty well with Cobi because we both have offensive
minds," said Ruiz, who has four goals and two assists in the
postseason. "He has more experience than I do, but we both play with
a goal in mind all the time."</TE>

<HD>Tragic Start for Oak Tree</HD>
<DH>Horse racing: Siphonic, in his first race since March 17,
dies after finishing second.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BILL CHRISTINE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In his office at Santa Anita's barn 96, trainer David Hofmans reached
into a desk drawer for a notebook that cataloged the short-lived
career of Siphonic, who not so long ago was rated one of the
country's best 3-year-olds.</LD>
<LD>   Hofmans ticked off the dates. "June 1st," he said, "he came back
to me from the farm. The end of July, he had his first breeze
[workout]."</LD>
<LD>   On Wednesday, about 15 minutes after the third race on opening day
of the Oak Tree meet at Santa Anita, the information in Hofmans'
notebook became meaningless. Siphonic, running for the first time
since March 17, finished second by a head, but then in the receiving
barn, where beaten favorites are tested for prohibited drugs, the
colt collapsed twice and died, probably of a heart attack.</LD>
<TE>   "It's unbelievable," said a shaken Hofmans, back at his barn.
"It's real bad. This was a healthy, sound horse. He came back from
the race looking good, maybe a little tired, but I thought he looked
pretty good. He was as good a horse as I've ever trained."</TE>
<TE>   Hofmans scratched Adoration, a filly he was scheduled to run in
the Lady's Secret Handicap later in the day. Both Siphonic and
Adoration are owned by John and Jerry Amerman of Palos Verdes
Estates, who are on vacation.</TE>
<TE>   B. William Bell, a state veterinarian, said that another
veterinarian, Rod Daniel, was unable to get a heartbeat after
Siphonic had fallen a second time. The first time he fell was in the
receiving barn's walking ring, after he had been given a bath. His
handlers, including Grant Hofmans, the trainer's son and assistant,
got the horse back on his feet and put him in a stall before he went
down again.</TE>
<TE>   Grant Hofmans called his father and said: "We've got a real bad
situation here."</TE>
<TE>   Hofmans hurried to the receiving barn, but by the time he arrived,
his horse was gone.</TE>
<TE>   "There was no sign of anything wrong," Hofmans said. "No trauma,
no blood. He must have taken three deep breaths and it was all over."</TE>
<TE>   Bell said that a post-mortem examination would be done.</TE>
<TE>   "All we can do is assume that he bled internally somewhere," Bell
said. "Either [in] the thoracic cavity or the abdominal cavity. We
probably won't have an answer for a couple of days."</TE>
<TE>   Hofmans said that the Amermans had insured Siphonic, but he wasn't
sure of the amount. They had bought the colt for $210,000 at a
yearling auction at Keeneland in 2000, and after Siphonic ran third
in the Breeders' Cup Juvenile last October and won the Hollywood
Futurity in December, he became one of the early favorites for this
year's Kentucky Derby. When Jerry Bailey got off the horse after the
Breeders' Cup race, he said to Hofmans: "I'd like to ride him again.
I'll even pay my own way if I have to."</TE>
<TE>   Siphonic was taken off the Derby trail in March, after a
second-place finish in the Santa Catalina Stakes at Santa Anita and a
third in the San Felipe. He was the odds-on favorite in both races.
Hofmans said that he twisted his neck as he stumbled out of the gate
in the Santa Catalina. The colt spent two months at the Amermans'
farm in Temecula, where he was treated by a chiropractor and an
acupuncturist, before he returned to the track four months ago.</TE>
<TE>   Siphonic's record was three wins, two seconds and two thirds in
seven starts, with purses totaling $774,778. Hofmans had long-range
goals of reaching the Strub series at Santa Anita this coming winter.
Mike Smith rode Siphonic for the first time Wednesday, when after a
stiff stretch drive he was beaten by a head by Resolve in a
seven-furlong race. Smith later won the Lady's Secret with Azeri.</TE>
<TE>   "He was breathing hard after the race," Smith said of Siphonic,
"but that's natural for a horse who's been away that long. There was
nothing to think that he was in distress. He was bouncing after the
race. My heart goes out to all the people connected with this horse.
This game's a real roller-coaster ride, isn't it?"</TE>

<LD>Winning her sixth race in a row and ninth in 10 career starts, Azeri
overwhelmed six rivals Wednesday to win the $217,500 Lady's Secret
Handicap by 3 1/2 lengths as the Oak Tree Racing Assn. opened its
26-day meet at Santa Anita.</LD>
<LD>   Trainer Laura de Seroux said that Azeri would run next in the
$2-million Breeders' Cup Distaff on Oct. 26 at Arlington Park, where
she will carry equal weight of 126 pounds instead of spotting the
opposition. In the Lady's Secret, Azeri toted a career-high 127
pounds, which was 12 pounds more than Starrer, the second-place
finisher.</LD>
<LD>   "She's [at] another level, and I'm so in awe of her and love her
so much," de Seroux said. "I'm glad [jockey Mike Smith] was as easy
as possible with her because of all the weight she carried."</LD>
<TE>   Azeri, increasing her earnings to more than $1.1 million, ran 1
1/16 miles in 1:41 1/5, fastest running of the stake since Hollywood
Wildcat's record of 1:40 3/5 in 1994.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Two of the most prominent basketball players in Southern California
announced their college commitments as guard Omar Wilkes of L.A.
Loyola chose Kansas and guard Noelle Quinn of Torrance Bishop
Montgomery picked UCLA.</LD>
<LD>   Wilkes also considered UCLA, where his father, Jamaal, was a
member of two national championship teams in the early 1970s, and
California. Even though he was impressed with a late recruiting push
by the Bruins, Wilkes said, he selected Kansas because he had
developed "a great rapport with Coach [Roy] Williams and the
players."</LD>
<LD>   The 6-foot-4 standout was selected Southern Section Division I-A
player of the year last season after averaging 22 points, six
rebounds and six assists for the section champion Cubs.</LD>
<TE>   Wilkes' close friend, Reno High center David Padgett, also
committed to Kansas on Wednesday, though Wilkes said his decision
wasn't predicated on Padgett's choice. "My decision was made before
his," Wilkes said. "It's been a decision I've had in my heart for a
while."</TE>
<TE>   At his news conference on the Loyola campus, Wilkes donned a
Kansas cap and unveiled a penciled sketch of himself in a Kansas
uniform. The sketch was drawn by a janitor at Kansas and presented to
Wilkes during Williams' home visit.</TE>
<TE>   Wilkes said he would bring leadership to the Jayhawk program. "I
will go in there and work my butt off from Day 1," he said, "do
whatever I can to get Coach Williams the national title, if they
don't get it this year."</TE>
<TE>   Quinn is a prep All-American in basketball and volleyball. The
6-foot guard has led the Knights to three consecutive state Division
III basketball championships. She averaged 21.8 points last season
and is a straight-A student.</TE>
<TE>   The Bruins also received a commitment from Amanda Livingston of
Fullerton Troy, an All-Orange County selection by The Times last
season. The 6-1 forward averaged 19 points and 10 rebounds. She
helped Troy to a 29-4 record and the Southern Section Division II-A
final.</TE>
<TE>   Santa Ana Mater Dei guard Wesley Washington, a member of The
Times' All-Star team and player of the year in Orange County, will
not sign early with California and is reassessing his college
options.</TE>
<TE>   The 6-3 shooting guard, who committed to California last April,
remains interested in playing for the Bears but is considering other
opportunities in case he is unable to meet California's academic
standards, Mater Dei Coach Gary McKnight said.</TE>
<TE>   All-City receiver Mark Bradford of L.A. Fremont is taking a
recruiting visit to LSU in November. He also has scheduled a visit to
Oregon in January and is considering USC and UCLA.</TE>

disqualified from the boys' race of champions in the Great American
Cross-Country Festival in Charlotte, N.C., on Saturday. But his
disqualification for taking a wrong turn that cut about 300 meters
off the 5,000-meter course couldn't lower his confidence.</TE>
<TE>   Robles, the runner-up in the Southern Section Division II
championships last year, finished fourth in Charlotte before the
disqualifications.</TE>
<TE>   "Juan felt disappointed about being disqualified," Valencia Coach
Patricia Hadley said. "But he also feels good about the race because

<LD>SOUTHERN SECTION</LD>
<LD>   Corona Centennial (3-0) at San Clemente (3-0), 7:30 p.m., Friday</LD>
<LD>   The numbers-crunchers at calpreps.com have deemed Centennial the
Southern Section team most likely to go undefeated during the regular
season. And it's easy to see why they did. Terrell Jackson leads
Southern California in scoring with 14 touchdowns and has averaged
222 yards rushing. Quarterback Shaun Lewis has completed 69.1% of his
passes for 534 yards and four touchdowns. But if the Huskies, winners
of 20 consecutive regular-season games and No. 10 in The Times'
rankings, are to run the table, they'll have to get past 13th-ranked
San Clemente, which has multitalented receiver Chris Miller, tailback
Cheyne Verhagen, who has 255 yards rushing, and quarterback Beau
Budde, who rarely throws a bad pass.</LD>
<TE>   Ben Bolch</TE>
<TE>   *Chino Hills Ayala (3-0) at Los Altos (2-1), 7:30 p.m., Friday</TE>
<TE>   The defense of No. 24 Ayala has allowed only two touchdowns in the
last 10 quarters and stopped Long Beach Jordan's quick-strike offense
last week in a 37-12 victory. Neither team can afford turnovers.
Eleventh-ranked Los Altos has scored 152 points in three games, so
Ayala's wing-T offense must control the clock and keep the ball from
quarterback Carlos Ordonez, who has averaged 21.2 yards per
completion with eight touchdowns and only two interceptions.</TE>
<TE>   Martin Henderson</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   CITY SECTION</TE>
<TE>   Dorsey (1-2) at Roosevelt (3-0), 7 p.m., Friday</TE>
<TE>   A victory ushers Roosevelt into the City's upper echelon. The
Rough Riders' bread and butter is their running game out of the
wing-T formation. Zach Owens and Jody Adewale have combined to rush
for 1,092 yards. But Dorsey held No. 7 Santa Margarita without a
touchdown for the first time in three seasons and recorded four sacks
in a 5-0 defeat last week. The Dons have limited three opponents to
14.5 points per game. Dorsey has won the last two meetings by a
combined 11 points.</TE>
<TE>   Eric Stephens</TE>
<TE>   *INTERSECTIONAL</TE>
<TE>   Antelope Valley (3-0) vs. L.A. Loyola (3-0) at Santa Monica
College, 7:30 p.m., Friday</TE>
<TE>   Quarterback Johnny Walker has rushed for 447 yards in the
Antelopes' triple-option attack. The No. 2 Cubs counter with running
back Bo Renaud, who has rushed for 444 yards and seven touchdowns.
Renaud had 142 yards and three touchdowns in the 38-6 victory over
Pasadena Muir last week. Loyola has allowed 32 points this season.</TE>
<TE>   Mike Bresnahan</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   L.A. Crenshaw (2-1) at Mission Viejo (3-0), 7 p.m., Friday</TE>
<TE>   Crenshaw is seeking its biggest victory over a Southern Section
opponent since it upset Loyola, 7-6, in 1999. This game also could be
a low-scoring affair, considering No. 4 Mission Viejo posted only a
10-7 victory over Huntington Beach Marina last week and has struggled
passing since quarterback Josh Rodarmel went down with a broken
collarbone in the opener. Marty Tadman will make his first start at
quarterback. Mission Viejo's strengths are running backs Ryan Holmes
(287 yards) and Brandon Johnston (172) and a defense that has limited
opponents to 8.7 points per game. Crenshaw's Daymeion Hughes ran for
131 yards in a 40-0 win over Hawthorne.</TE>
<TE>   Ben Bolch</TE>
<TE>   *Newhall Hart (2-0-1) at Lake Balboa Birmingham (2-1), 7 p.m.,
Friday</TE>
<TE>   The scoreboard operator figures to be busy because the teams
feature high-powered offenses. Led by quarterback Sean Norton (57%
passing, 887 yards) and wide receiver Cody Kase (16 catches, 336
yards), No. 6 Hart is averaging 30 points. Birmingham, averaging 34.3
points, is led by running back Dennis Keyes, quarterback Ryan
Lombardo and two-way threat Chad Green. After tying Los Alamitos on a
last-second desperation-pass touchdown, Hart dominated Ventura St.
Bonaventure and Westlake Village Westlake. Hart sophomore cornerback
Ryan Wolfe, who held his own with St. Bonaventure standout receiver
Whitney Lewis, will try to contain Green.</TE>
<TE>   Eric Stephens</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Valencia (2-1) at Arroyo Grande (3-0), 7:30 p.m., Friday</TE>
<TE>   Arroyo Grande is the top-ranked team in the Southern Section
Division IV poll and ranked No. 12 by The Times, but Coach Jon Huss
is fearful of Valencia's speed. "When we got the film of them, it was
obvious they have the kind of speed and athleticism we don't see very
often," Huss said. "Of course, that's one of the reasons why we
scheduled them." While No. 20 Valencia, a Division II team that lost
to Hart in the Division III final last season, has big-play threats
in running back Charles Burnley, quarterback Stephen Wright and wide
receivers Geoff Tisdale and Desmond Blair, Arroyo Grande runs a
grind-it-out, misdirection offense in which seven or eight players
are expected to carry the ball. Huss figures the best way for Arroyo
Grande to overcome Valencia's speed is through turnovers, but he
doesn't expect the Vikings to produce many of those after committing
seven in a 28-26 victory over Oxnard last week.</TE>

<LD>CHRIS MILLER</LD>
<LD>   School: San Clemente</LD>
<LD>   Position: Receiver and kicker</LD>
<TE>   Height: 6-2 * Weight: 180 * Year: Senior</TE>
<TE>   It's the San Clemente conundrum.</TE>
<TE>   Is Chris Miller a receiver who also punts and kicks? Or a kicker
who also plays receiver?</TE>
<TE>   He does it all well, making it hard to tell.</TE>
<TE>   At San Clemente football games, you'll see Miller pulling down
catch after catch. Then you'll notice him lining up for extra points.
And field goals. And going in to punt.</TE>
<TE>   A modern-day George Blanda, he scored every point in San
Clemente's season opener against Huntington Beach Edison.</TE>
<TE>   Miller had a touchdown catch, kicked the extra point and made
field goals of 45 and 44 yards in the Tritons' 13-7 victory.</TE>
<TE>   Miller had similar numbers against Fountain Valley, snaring 10
receptions for 102 yards and two touchdowns, making all four of his
extra-point attempts and a 36-yard field goal, and averaging 49.5
yards on two punts in San Clemente's 31-0 victory. His only misstep
was a missed 48-yard field goal.</TE>
<TE>   "Usually kickers are just specialists," San Clemente Coach Eric
Patton said. "Chris is an exception to that. He's a great receiver
too."</TE>
<TE>   Miller has 21 catches for 210 yards and four touchdowns this
season for San Clemente (3-0), No. 13 in The Times' rankings.</TE>
<TE>   Then there's his punting: He is averaging 42.3 yards per punt,
including a 66-yarder last Friday against Aliso Niguel.</TE>
<TE>   Not even Miller knows what to call himself, saying, "I've been
doing both since my freshman year," he said.</TE>

<HD>Golden League Regaining Its Value</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>MIKE BRESNAHAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In a world where only playoff success counts, the name would have
been changed from the Golden League to the Tarnished Brass League
based on its lack of postseason punch in recent seasons.</LD>
<LD>   Once a premier place for football, the Antelope Valley-based
league stumbled and tumbled to a 14-21 record in playoff games since
1996, including a 3-12 playoff mark from 1998-2000.</LD>
<LD>   Postseason performances from Golden League teams were almost as
poor as the mittens-and-parka playoff weather in Lancaster, where
temperatures in November dip to lows of 38 degrees on average. The
only playoff guarantees were brisk hot chocolate sales at the
concession stands.</LD>
<TE>   But in the sunny days of September, the league has rarely looked
more golden than now. Three weeks into the season, Antelope Valley,
Palmdale and Highland highs are a combined 9-0, and while the
nonleague competition hasn't been overwhelming, there again might be
late-November games in the frigid fall milieu of a Golden League
school.</TE>
<TE>   "The Golden League hasn't gotten a lot of respect in the last few
years," Palmdale Coach Jeff Williams said. "It's important to get it
back."</TE>
<TE>   Antelope Valley has had the most successful past and most
noteworthy start this season, running its triple-option offense with
results that haven't been seen since Jermaine Lewis rushed for 2,511
yards in 1995. Lewis went on to play at UCLA.</TE>
<TE>   The play of quarterback Johnny Walker, last season's Golden League
player of the year, has some people calling this one of the top
Antelope Valley teams in Coach Brent Newcomb's 25 years as coach.</TE>
<TE>   Newcomb is cautious.</TE>
<TE>   "You've got to win in November," he said. "If you don't win in
November, you're not going any place. It's still October."</TE>
<TE>   Antelope Valley appeared in consecutive Southern Section Division
II championship games, defeating Newhall Hart in 1994 and losing to
the Indians in 1995, but struggled in recent seasons.</TE>
<TE>   "Lancaster opened in 1997 and a lot of guys went from our
[attendance] boundaries over there," Newcomb said. "It took us a
little while to recover after that."</TE>
<TE>   Palmdale has not needed any time to recover from last season's
unexpected run to the Division III semifinals. The Falcons scored a
32-16 upset over Alta Loma Friday, with a ground game that features
LaRon McIntyre and Sean Edwards.</TE>
<TE>   "It goes in cycles like that," said Williams, in his 12th season.
"It's good to be on an upswing."</TE>
<TE>   Highland opened 3-0 for the first time in eight years, relying
heavily on running back Kris Theus, who has rushed for 385 yards.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   It's a good idea to avoid misquoting North Hollywood
Harvard-Westlake Coach Greg Gonzalez--he'll call you on it.</TE>
<TE>   Gonzalez has a master's degree in journalism from Columbia and
used to be a sports reporter for The National, among other
newspapers.</TE>
<TE>   He covered Pacific 10 Conference football and the Anaheim Angels
before the short-lived newspaper folded, then briefly bounced around
as a freelancer before entering coaching at Montebello Cantwell
Sacred Heart in 1992.</TE>
<TE>   Gonzalez, in his first year as head coach at Harvard-Westlake
(2-1), has seen media coverage from just about every angle: He was a
receiver-defensive back at Columbia from 1983-85, during the Lions'
44-game losing streak, an NCAA record for futility at the time.</TE>
<TE>   "As a player in college, I always thought the media didn't
understand," Gonzalez said. "Reporters didn't have a real
appreciation for the human cost during the streak. They'd come in,
ask how it felt to be losers, and leave."</TE>
<TE>   (Prairie View A&amp;M broke Columbia's record, losing 80 consecutive
games from 1989-98.)</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   There's bellowing over an official's call in Montebello.</TE>
<TE>   Montebello led Pico Rivera El Rancho on Friday, 14-9, in a
nonleague game that had less than 10 seconds left. What happened in
those final seconds has angered Montebello coaches.</TE>
<TE>   "We were robbed," Coach Bill Drulias said.</TE>
<TE>   El Rancho had the ball at the Montebello 40 and called for a trick
play. The El Rancho quarterback pitched the ball to the running back,
who handed it off to a receiver on a reverse. The receiver then
appeared to throw the ball back to the quarterback, who fell on the
ball because it was thrown too short. The play was initially ruled a
lateral, the clock kept running and time ran out.</TE>
<TE>   The head referee overturned the call and determined the play was
an incomplete pass, to the chagrin of Montebello coaches, who drew a
15-yard unsportsmanlike penalty. The ball was moved to the Montebello
25 and a final play was allowed.</TE>
<TE>   El Rancho scored on a pass and won, 15-14.</TE>
<TE>   Montebello fell to 0-3, although the coaches' tempers have only
risen after seeing videotape of the play.</TE>
<TE>   "The quarterback was standing five yards back from the thrower and
had to go chase down the throw. He was about seven yards deeper than
the receiver," Drulias said. "It wasn't even close to being a forward
pass. The video shows it."</TE>
<TE>   The Southern Section does not review games that are disputed
because of a referee's call, unless it is determined that a referee
acted with unfair bias toward a team.</TE>
<TE>   "We're not one to change judgment calls made on the field,"
Southern Section spokesman Thom Simmons said.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Those who liked Miss Nicolie in the Generous Portion a month ago at
Del Mar will have to take a much shorter price on the filly in
today's $75,000 Cover Gal Stakes at Santa Anita.</LD>
<LD>   Owned and bred by Ron Gomez and trained by Wayne Baker, the
daughter of Walter Willy was almost 16-1 when she picked up her first
victory in her fourth start on Sept. 4 with jockey David Flores.</LD>
<LD>   Miss Nicolie, a California bred who had been fifth and second
twice in her first three races for Gomez and Baker, will break from
the outside in the field of eight in the Cover Gal.</LD>
<TE>   Three of her opponents chased her home in the Generous Portion.
Summer Wind Dancer, who will move off the rail today, was third;
Servaline, a $2-million yearling purchase, was fourth; and the maiden
Small Town Girl was fifth. Servaline and Small Town Girl are trained
by Bob Baffert.</TE>
<TE>   The remainder of the lineup is composed of fillies who made their
most recent starts at Fairplex Park: Buttertart, Last Kiss, Zam Zam
and Sky's Snow.</TE>
<TE>   Race of the day: Labamta Babe, who won the Santa Catalina Stakes
earlier this year before being sidelined because of injury, will make
his second start on the comeback trail in today's eighth at Belmont
Park. The race is a $50,000 allowance at one mile on the turf and it
will be the 3-year-old Skywalker's colt first start on the grass.</TE>
<TE>   Who's hot: Steve Jerkens. The trainer won with four of his first
11 starters at Belmont Park.</TE>
<TE>   Who's not: The field in today's fourth at Santa Anita. The 11
original entrants were winless in 66 starts.</TE>
<TE>   Exotically speaking: A pick three singling Lucky Spirit in the
fifth, using Slewping, Scotty Wotty, Groom On The Run, Kedington and
California Goal in the sixth and Miss Nicolie, Summer Wind Dancer and
Servaline in the seventh.</TE>
<TE>   Winners: Previous day/meet total: 4/4. Money: Previous day/meet
total: $17.40 Total money bet: $18.</TE>

<HD>Stewart's Benching Puts Maddox in Rare Spot</HD>
<DH>Football: Former UCLA quarterback hasn't started in NFL
since 1992 but gets call for Steelers.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SAM FARMER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The strange saga of Tommy Maddox took an unexpected twist Wednesday
when the Pittsburgh Steelers named him their starting quarterback for
Sunday's game against New Orleans and sent Pro Bowl quarterback
Kordell Stewart to the bench.</LD>
<LD>   Maddox, a former first-round pick from UCLA, has not started an
NFL game since 1992 and left the sport to sell insurance for three
years.</LD>
<LD>   He returned to the sport the hard way, playing for the New Jersey
Red Dogs of the Arena Football League in 2000, then winning a
championship in spring 2001 with the Los Angeles Xtreme of the XFL,
which folded after one season.</LD>
<TE>   It wasn't until Sunday, when he came off the bench to lead the
Steelers to a come-from-behind, overtime victory over Cleveland, that
Maddox got a chance to show he belongs in the NFL.</TE>
<TE>   "I gave it a lot of thought and just feel it's the right thing to
do at this time," Pittsburgh Coach Bill Cowher said. "It's in the
best interest of the football team. I explained that to our players
and we are moving on."</TE>
<TE>   With Stewart as the starter, the Steelers were 1-2 and had scored
only 36 points. Maddox entered late in the fourth quarter against the
Browns, completing 11 of 13 passes for 122 yards and a touchdown that
tied the score. His team won, 16-13, when Todd Peterson kicked a
31-yard field goal in overtime.</TE>
<TE>   Facing his third benching in six years, Stewart made no attempt to
mask his disappointment Wednesday when speaking to reporters.</TE>
<TE>   "Do I agree with the decision? No," he said. "But I've never said
it was the Kordell Stewart show. I've always said it was the
Pittsburgh Steelers show. I'll get a chance to start sometime."</TE>
<TE>   Stewart is coming off his best season as a pro. He was the team's
most valuable player in 2001 and finished third in NFL MVP voting,
the best finish by an AFC player.</TE>
<TE>   "I talked to Kordell a long time this morning," Maddox said
Wednesday. "I just wanted to make sure we were still on great terms,
and we had a great talk. I understand where he's coming from because
I've been there."</TE>
<TE>   Actually, Maddox has been just about everywhere in his odyssey of
a career. He left UCLA after his sophomore season at age 20 and was a
first-round pick by Denver in 1992. Because of an injury to John
Elway, the 6-foot-4 Maddox started four games for the Broncos late in
his rookie season. He has not started an NFL game since.</TE>
<TE>   After two seasons in Denver, Maddox was traded to the L.A. Rams,
where he lasted one season and appeared in five games, primarily as a
holder. He spent a season with the New York Giants in 1995, was cut
in training camp the following summer, then failed to make it through
Atlanta's camp.</TE>
<TE>   His options rapidly dwindling, Maddox walked away from football
and opened an insurance business in the Dallas area. He kept the job
for three years, but football gnawed at him. When the Red Dogs called
late in 1999, he leaped at the chance to play. He threw for 3,800
yards and 64 touchdowns in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   "When I showed up in the arena league, you just had to laugh,"
Maddox told the Denver Post last year. "I was used to huge locker
rooms with guys getting all your stuff. All of a sudden, you don't
have a locker room and you're lucky if they give you a jock. You're
dressing out of your car. You're riding school buses to games. But I
was so excited to be back and be part of playing football again, I
didn't care if I had to buy my uniform."</TE>
<TE>   A year later, Maddox led the L.A. Xtreme to a 9-3 record and a
38-6 victory over the San Francisco Demons in the title game. There,
he played for Xtreme coach Al Luginbill, who also coached future NFL
MVP Kurt Warner when he played for the Amsterdam Admirals of NFL
Europe.</TE>
<TE>   "Tommy and Kurt are very similar," said Luginbill, now coach and
general manager of arena football's Detroit Fury. "Kurt has a little
bit stronger arm to the edge of the field, but they both have great
releases and are tough mentally and physically. Tommy is taller and
has a little bit better feet in the pocket. Neither one of them is
going to threaten you with the run, but they can both move around and
buy time.</TE>
<TE>   "It's really hard to win a championship, at any level. In order to
do it, you have to have a quarterback that makes plays at times in a
game when he absolutely has to do it. That's the thing that impressed
me most about Tommy. If a play had to be made, he'd make it."</TE>
<TE>   The Steelers were sufficiently impressed, and last season signed
him as Stewart's backup. They sweetened the deal in August, signing
Maddox to a five-year, $4.5-million deal, including a $500,000
signing bonus.</TE>
<TE>   "Tommy has made a sensational comeback," said San Francisco
General Manager Terry Donahue, Maddox's coach at UCLA. "All of us
like to see people that overcome obstacles and overcome the odds.
It's a phenomenal success story."</TE>

<BD>From Staff Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>After having to admit that he again poured himself into his game over
the summer--thousands of jumpers, miles with a new track coach, tons
on the squat rack--Mark Madsen stood at the other end of that work,
smiled humbly, and said he'd accept whatever came next.</LD>
<LD>   "I honestly don't think a whole lot about it," he said after
Wednesday's Laker practice. "Either way, it's going to be a positive.
I think good things will happen."</LD>
<LD>   Going on three years out of Stanford, Madsen is in the final
guaranteed season of his rookie contract. The Lakers will decide by
the end of training camp whether to exercise next season's option for
nearly $1.5 million.</LD>
<TE>   General Manager Mitch Kupchak said he had not reached a
conclusion, though in consecutive falls the club had declined similar
options for Tyronn Lue and Devean George. The game's dicey economy
might suggest the same fate for Madsen.</TE>
<TE>   In that case, Madsen, whose spirited play and engaging personality
have made him a favorite among fans, teammates and media, could
return as a free agent, as George did this summer.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   George will earn more than every Laker but Shaquille O'Neal, Kobe
Bryant, Robert Horry and Phil Jackson this season. And while Jackson
said he'd like to see George handle pressure situations--such as the
playoffs--better, he also does not expect a different player.</TE>
<TE>   "Devean was paid because he produced," Jackson said. "That's the
way we should pay players in the NBA, on production. His role
shouldn't have to change at all. We didn't pay him on potential. We
know what he can do and believe that what he did last year is no
fluke."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   O'Neal spent the latter part of Wednesday's practice sitting on an
exercise ball, grappling with Kurt Rambis and shadow-boxing Samaki
Walker. Recovering from Sept. 11 surgery, he's running out of things
to do.</TE>
<TE>   Tim Brown</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Alvin Gentry was asked to transform the Clippers from losers to
playoff contenders when he was hired as coach in the summer of 2000.
The Clippers won 31 games in 2000-01, up from 15 the season before he
was hired. They won 39 games last season, their best record in a
decade.</TE>
<TE>   "If we're healthy, we can be a playoff team," Gentry said on the
second day of the Clippers' training camp at Palm Desert. "I think
our players expect us to be a playoff team."</TE>
<TE>   The Clippers haven't participated in the playoffs since losing to
the Utah Jazz in three games in the opening round of the 1997
postseason. There has been some thought that Gentry's job could be in
jeopardy if the Clippers don't reach the playoffs, particularly since
his contract expires at season's end.</TE>
<TE>   "If you're asking me if I worry if we don't make the playoffs that
I'll be fired, the answer is, no," Gentry said. "My job is to make
[the Clippers] play unselfishly, make them play hard. If I do that
and it doesn't work out, then it doesn't work out.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm worried about how to fit Andre Miller into our team. I'm
trying to get Chris Wilcox to develop. I'm wondering if we can get
Michael [Olowokandi] playing at the same level he did at the end of
last season. I don't worry about my contract because I have no
control over it."</TE>

<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>It was one strikeout, six pitches, but it was so much more.</LD>
<LD>   It was redemption for Brendan Donnelly, but it was more than that
as well.</LD>
<LD>   By striking out John Vander Wal in the eighth inning of Game 2 of
their division series Wednesday night, Donnelly helped save an 8-6
victory for the stubborn Angels over the New York Yankees and also
might have helped save--well, if not the career--but the postseason
legacy and reputation of Mike Scioscia, their equally stubborn
manager.</LD>
<TE>   Spitting at the criticism and second guessing that had greeted his
decision to leave closer Troy Percival warming up in the bullpen as
Bernie Williams slugged a decisive, two-out, three-run home run off
Donnelly in the eighth inning of Game 1, Scioscia did it again.</TE>
<TE>   Two on, eighth inning, the Angels leading, 7-5, Percival warming
up in the bullpen, Scioscia in need of a pitcher because Ben Weber
had just attempted to barehand Raul Mondesi's one-hop grounder to the
mound, spraining his index finger, and does the manager call for his
up-and-ready closer?</TE>
<TE>   Of course not.</TE>
<TE>   As the television cameras catch Percival standing and shrugging,
Donnelly takes off his windbreaker, trots to the mound, is given as
long as he needs to warm up and responds by striking out Vander Wal
with that Williams' home run still fresh on his mind, although fresh
might not be the word.</TE>
<TE>   "Usually I'm able to put things like that behind me," he would say
later, "but I was still bitter, still disappointed.</TE>
<TE>   "I mean, I would have paid to get into tonight's game. I wanted to
come right back. I wanted redemption, and it was huge for me to get
it."</TE>
<TE>   He got it with that strike out of Vander Wal and was then gone.</TE>
<TE>   Now Percival arrived to get the final four outs, surviving the
customary Yankee threat in the ninth to help send the Angels back to
Anaheim with a resilient split and providing Donnelly with a chance
to get some sleep on the flight home, the Williams homer having
deprived him of any when he got back to the hotel at about 1 a.m.
Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   "My wife went to bed at about 1:30, but I didn't lay down until
5," he said. "I watched television and kept replaying the home run in
my mind, trying to figure out what I might have done differently. I
finally came to the conclusion that he just beat me. It's happened
before and it'll happen again if I pitch long enough. You have to
give him credit, although it's still going to stay with me for a
while."</TE>
<TE>   If there wasn't a resiliency to Donnelly, however, he wouldn't be
here, wouldn't be a 31-year-old rookie getting his first chance to
pitch in the major leagues after a 10-year minor league odyssey in
which he pitched for nine organizations, including two independent
league teams, often going to bed in Chattanooga or Nashua or Altona
thinking ... well, as he said after the Vander Wal strikeout, "What
the hell am I doing this for? It's time to go start a life. Then I'd
wake up the next morning and tell myself, 'This is what I do, this is
what I am. I'm a ballplayer."</TE>
<TE>   Released by the Chicago Cubs in August 2000, the same organization
that had also released him seven years before, Donnelly was signed as
a minor league free agent by the Angels in January 2002, and made his
major league debut this summer, becoming a pivotal piece in an
unheralded and largely anonymous bullpen that became the best in the
American League, based on statistics, at least.</TE>
<TE>   While pitching primarily in set-up situations, Donnelly appeared
in 46 games with one save, a 1-1 record and 2.17 earned-run average,
limiting opponents to a .184 average, the best on the Angel staff and
second best among AL relievers who pitched a minimum of 45 innings.</TE>
<TE>   If some of that luster was dented recently as Donnelly gave up
important home runs to Eric Chavez and Terrence Long in key games
with Oakland down the stretch, Scioscia didn't lose faith--before or
after the bomb by Williams in Game 1.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, Scioscia is limited in his options, but he put a
positive spin again on Donnelly's work after the Game 2 victory,
saying that the right-hander, despite all of his minor league
experience, is still a rookie on the major league stage and
occasionally will attempt to force a pitch in a count and situation,
as he did to Williams, that he shouldn't.</TE>
<TE>   "He'll learn from experience," Scioscia said. "His stuff is good
enough. Our bullpen has got us here and it will get us through the
playoffs. Brendan is a big part of that, but I didn't bring him in
tonight just to give him an opportunity for redemption. We didn't
want Troy to have to get five outs. We didn't want him to stretch
that far, and we liked the Donnelly/Vander Wal matchup more than
bringing in [left-hander Scott] Schoeneweis and having them bring a
right-handed hitter [Rondell White or Shane Spencer] off the bench."</TE>
<TE>   Donnelly certainly wasn't intimidated by the assignment against
the left-handed hitting Vander Wal, but he was surprised that
Percival wasn't called.</TE>
<TE>   "I was caught a little off guard," he said. "Troy was ready to go.
Fortunately, I had been up [an inning earlier] so I was still halfway
there. Like I said, I just wanted to get in, wanted to get back at it
as soon as I could."</TE>
<TE>   And when you've been where Donnelly has been, had as many
fast-food hamburgers as he has, pitching in the playoffs, on the
stage that is Yankee Stadium, "is a dream come true, the fulfillment
of a goal all players play for, and an opportunity I thought that I
would never get. I can't thank the Angels enough."</TE>
<TE>   Wednesday night, as Percival watched from the bullpen, the Angel
manager owed his 31-year-old rookie thanks as well.</TE>

<HD>Kitna Given the Bengals' Starting Job</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Three consecutive games, three starting quarterbacks for the NFL's
worst team.</LD>
<LD>   Coach Dick LeBeau informed the Cincinnati Bengals (0-4) on
Wednesday that he has decided to start Jon Kitna and stick with him
for the rest of the season.</LD>
<LD>   Gus Frerotte started in a 30-3 loss at Atlanta, and Akili Smith
went the distance in a 35-7 loss to Tampa Bay on Sunday. Kitna will
make his first start Sunday at Indianapolis.</LD>
<TE>   "Coach LeBeau stood in front of the team today and said this is
the guy he's going with and we're going to sink or swim," Kitna said.</TE>
<TE>   "Now, it doesn't matter if you like me or not, I'm going to be in
there, so we might as well get along."</TE>
<TE>   Kitna started 15 games last season, when he finished as the NFL's
lowest-rated passer. He lost the starting job to Frerotte in training
camp.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   A neurologist's exam confirmed that Green Bay receiver Terry Glenn
has post-traumatic migraine headaches, caused probably by a hit he
took in the season opener.</TE>
<TE>   Glenn apparently will try a different medicine for the headaches
that limited him to the first half of Green Bay's 17-14 victory over
the Carolina Panthers Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   He had the exam in New York Tuesday. The Packers list him as
questionable for the game at Chicago Monday.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   New York Jet Coach Herman Edwards said he would rotate players at
several spots, including middle linebacker, cornerback, safety and
guard.</TE>
<TE>   The Jets have given up 133 points.</TE>
<TE>   "Rotate? What does that mean? It doesn't matter. It won't change
my perspective I take to the game," starting middle linebacker Marvin
Jones said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Buffalo Bill defensive tackle Tyrone Robertson was suspended for
four games by the NFL for violating the league's substance-abuse
policy. Neither the team nor the league would not give any details.</TE>

<HD>Laperriere Plans to Play in Opener</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Chris Foster</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>After being sidelined for the majority of training camp because of
abdominal surgery in late August, the Kings' Ian Laperriere is on the
fast track to get back into game shape before the team's
regular-season opener against Phoenix next Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   "I'm not 100% perfect, but I'm getting better," said Laperriere,
who participated in full-contact drills for the second consecutive
day Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   Coach Andy Murray expects Laperriere to be in the lineup next week
against the Coyotes and so does Laperriere.</LD>
<TE>   "Recovery from the type of surgery I had is six to eight weeks,
but not too many guys have returned in six," said Laperriere, who had
eight goals and 25 points last season. "On opening night it will be
close to eight weeks and I'll be ready to go."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   After missing training camp last season because of a contract
dispute with the Boston Bruins, center Jason Allison has impressed
Murray in his preseason with the Kings.</TE>
<TE>   "His work ethic has been real good," Murray said of Allison, who
has three goals in three exhibition games. "He's adjusted to how we
practice, how we do things and how I am. He's actually pushing other
guys, getting them to compete."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Winger Steve Heinze is the biggest name among the players the
Kings left unprotected for Friday's waiver draft. Heinze, who will
earn $2 million this season and scored 15 goals last season, is
joined by forwards Derek Armstrong, Derek Bekar, Steve Kelly, Chris
Schmidt and Pavel Rosa, along with defensemen Jason Holland and Jan
Nemecek and goaltender Travis Scott.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Kings cut their roster to 30 when they assigned Kelly and
goaltender Brandon Boxma to the Manchester Monarchs of the American
Hockey League. Boxma, however, will open the season with the Long
Beach Ice Dogs after the Monarchs assigned him to the West Coast
Hockey League.</TE>
<TE>   Lonnie White</TE>
<TE>   Defenseman Kurt Sauer moved one step closer to making the Mighty
Ducks, as team officials trimmed their roster to 25.</TE>
<TE>   Defensemen Mike Commodore and Josh DeWolf were reassigned to minor
league Cincinnati, leaving the Ducks with eight defensemen. They are
expected to keep seven.</TE>
<TE>   Sauer, who played for Spokane in the Western Hockey League, was
considered a long shot to make the team.</TE>
<TE>   He was attempting to make the difficult jump from juniors to the
NHL.</TE>
<TE>   "He looks pretty unflappable to me," Coach Mike Babcock said. "I
have kept him playing to see how he handles it. It's one thing to
play a game or two a week and get up for them. But that's not real
life in the NHL, with the travel. He has passed every test so far."</TE>
<TE>   Sauer, 21, has played solid defense in exhibition games. His
6-foot-4, 225-pound frame would help the Ducks, who do not have much
size either up front or on defense.</TE>
<TE>   The Ducks signed Sauer as a free agent over the summer.</TE>
<TE>   Commodore, acquired from New Jersey in the trade that brought Petr
Sykora to the Ducks, was solid early in camp, but not nearly as
impressive as Sauer.</TE>
<TE>   The Ducks also assigned goalie Ilja Bryzgalov and forward Jonathan
Hedstrom to Cincinnati. Bryzgalov's departure leaves Martin Gerber as
the team's backup goalie.</TE>

<HD>Percival Shatters Mystique With His Power Drill</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Bill Plaschke</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>You knew it would come down to this.</LD>
<LD>   During four decades of plague, pestilence and late-inning
destruction, hasn't it always come down to this?</LD>
<LD>   As the clock struck midnight in the Bronx on Wednesday, Troy
Percival drilled a fastball into the back of the New York Yankees'
No. 12.</LD>
<TE>   Directly on top of the 1, smack in the middle of the jinx.</TE>
<TE>   Alfonso Soriano walked 90 feet to load the bases.</TE>
<TE>   The crowd chanted an obscenity.</TE>
<TE>   The television showed replays of how, moments earlier, spurned by
Mike Scioscia with one out, Percival had blatantly shrugged twice in
the bullpen as if he couldn't believe it.</TE>
<TE>   Now he was on the mound, two out, protecting a two-run lead, and
everyone figured it.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels' lovely and amazing season had come down to the
tight-jawed, beard-stubbled reliever.</TE>
<TE>   Facing arguably the best postseason player in baseball history.</TE>
<TE>   Derek Jeter is still looking for strike three.</TE>
<TE>   He is still standing there, staring at the 98-mph fastball that
Percival lasered on the outside corner.</TE>
<TE>   Percival is still stalking off the mound pumping his fist.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels are still dancing out of their dugout.</TE>
<TE>   With an eighth-inning comeback and too much Percival on Wednesday,
the Angels turned magic to mush, hung ghosts on the line with the
other dirty sheets, stole an 8-6 victory over the Yankees in Game 2
of the American League division series.</TE>
<TE>   The feeling will last until Friday, when the five-game series,
knotted at one game apiece, returns to Anaheim for the next two
games.</TE>
<TE>   At one point they were eight outs--or maybe one pitch--from likely
extinction. But now the Angels are in a position to advance to the
American League championship series without leaving home.</TE>
<TE>   It is a position of confidence and steadiness. It is also a
position controlled by Percival.</TE>
<TE>   This is his series now.</TE>
<TE>   The comeback Yankees will have more shots at him. The media and
fans, in an uproar Tuesday when the Angels blew a lead with Percival
in the bullpen, will be focused on him.</TE>
<TE>   Given his status as the team's emotional, long-suffering veteran
who dressed across from a framed Gene Autry jersey, it is fitting.</TE>
<TE>   And it is just the way Percival wants it.</TE>
<TE>   "If we're going to win, lose or draw, I want to be the one doing
it," he said after the game in the clubhouse, his half T-shirt
darkened with sweat, his eyes still wild.</TE>
<TE>   He nearly did all three things Wednesday night, beginning in the
bottom of the eighth inning, with the Angels leading 7-5 after Garret
Anderson and Troy Glaus had hit consecutive homers and Adam Kennedy
had driven in a run with a sacrifice fly in the top half.</TE>
<TE>   Percival was warming up while reliever Ben Weber was allowing the
potential tying runs to reach base. He was the only reliever warm
when Weber was chased with a Raul Mondesi ground ball that sprained
his right index finger.</TE>
<TE>   There was one out, and Scioscia was ripped Tuesday for not
bringing Percival in with one out, and so ...</TE>
<TE>   Into the game came Brendan Donnelly, who because of the injury,
could take as many warmup pitches as he wanted.</TE>
<TE>   Out in the bullpen, in front of the cameras, Percival spoke for
much of the Angel nation by exaggeratedly shrugging not once, but
twice.</TE>
<TE>   No, he wasn't second-guessing his manager. He was just surprised
because there was no one else ready.</TE>
<TE>   "I was puzzled," he said. "I'm the only one loose, I'm walking
down the steps, and I got pulled back. That's never happened before."</TE>
<TE>   Despite the questioning of critics like me, Scioscia feels his
refusal to vary from his regular-season approach has led to the
Angels' calm behavior. And so Wednesday, even though he knew he would
be ripped if Donnelly faltered, he stuck by his policy that if the
Angels were leading, that Percival would not be required to get more
than four outs.</TE>
<TE>   "We're looking to Percy to try to keep him as short as we can,"
Scioscia said.</TE>
<TE>   After Donnelly struck out John Vander Wal, Percival was short, all
right.</TE>
<TE>   Short of patience and ready to knock the Yankees on their shorts.
Which he almost did with Soriano.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't want to hit him, but I wanted to back him off the
plate," Percival said. "I will apologize for that."</TE>
<TE>   And then, with Jeter, whom he struck out looking on four pitches?</TE>
<TE>   "I know his reputation," he said. "I know what he does with low
pitches. I wanted to keep the ball on the top of the zone."</TE>
<TE>   It wasn't finished, of course. With Percival, as with the Angels,
there is always drama.</TE>
<TE>   So about that run in the ninth inning, those two runners left on
base as he struck out Nick Johnson and fooled Mondesi into a popout?</TE>
<TE>   "I threw about 108 pitches," he said with a weary grin. "But
against this team, you take what you can get and you go home."</TE>
<TE>   Beating baseball's current dynasty one time in October means
little. The battle has just begun. Percival knows it.</TE>
<TE>   "I know all about it," he said. "But I don't see it as magic. They
have a good team. It isn't magic."</TE>
<TE>   He was talking about the Yankees. He could have been talking about
the Angels, this relief pitcher with a squinty stare, a short memory,
and a series resting in his right arm.</TE>

<HD>Sampson Will Coach Costa Rica</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GRAHAME L. JONES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Steve Sampson, who coached the United States to the 1998 World Cup in
France, made soccer history Wednesday by becoming the first American
to take charge of a foreign national team when he was named Costa
Rica's coach.</LD>
<LD>   Sampson, 45, from Agoura Hills, agreed to a $1.4-million contract
that will run through the end of qualifying for the 2006 World Cup in
Germany.</LD>
<LD>   Costa Rica's soccer federation got in touch with Sampson last
month after it failed to reach agreement with Alexandre Guimaraes,
who had coached the team to the 2002 World Cup in South Korea and
Japan, where it defeated China, tied Turkey and lost to eventual
champion Brazil.</LD>
<TE>   "They contacted me about three weeks ago and I immediately told
them yes," Sampson told the Associated Press. He said he would move
to San Jose, Costa Rica, next month, with his family following the
end of the school year.</TE>
<TE>   Sampson, who coached Santa Clara to the NCAA co-championship in
1989, was an assistant under Bora Milutinovic on the 1994 U.S. World
Cup team before becoming national coach in 1995. He had a 26-22-14
record as U.S. coach, leaving after the U.S. team lost all three
games at the France '98 World Cup.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm enthusiastic about the opportunity," he said, "because Costa
Rica has enough talent to qualify for the World Cup in Germany."</TE>
<TE>   Inter Milan Falls</TE>
<TE>   Arsenal and Valencia maintained their perfect records in Champions
League play Wednesday, but Ronaldo's former and current teams, Inter
Milan and Real Madrid, both suffered setbacks.</TE>
<TE>   Inter Milan was shocked, 2-1, at home by Olympique Lyon, which got
goals from Sidney Govou and Sonny Anderson before Fabio Cannavaro
scored for Inter. It was the Italian team's first loss at home in
European competition in 39 years, ending a 33-game unbeaten streak.</TE>
<TE>   "No, it is not one step back, it is more two or three steps back,"
said Argentine Coach Hector Cuper.</TE>
<TE>   Defending champion Real Madrid, meanwhile, had to battle back to
tie AEK Athens, 3-3, in Greece, relying on two first-half goals from
Zinedine Zidane to keep pace with AEK, which scored three times in an
adventurous first 45 minutes through Vassilis Tsartas, Christos
Maladenis and Demis Nikolaidis.</TE>
<TE>   The only goal of the second half came from Guti, who scored on the
hour off a pass from Roberto Carlos, whose fellow Brazilian, Ronaldo,
has yet to make his Real Madrid debut after his $46.3-million

<LD>UCLA coaches have browsed their extensive menu of offensive backs for
a month. The Pacific 10 Conference schedule is looming and it's time
to make a choice.</LD>
<LD>   Super-size it.</LD>
<LD>   Manuel White Jr., a 6-foot-3, 243-pound sophomore, is expected to
get most of the carries Saturday against Oregon State, and beyond.
With sturdy legs and a purposeful straight-arm, White is poised to
become the centerpiece of the Bruin ground game.</LD>
<TE>   "We took four games to see what our personality is," said Kelly
Skipper, the Bruin offensive coordinator. "Now we know what we can
do, and Manuel will be doing a lot of it. Now we can shape our game
plan to our personnel."</TE>
<TE>   Translation: Mega-size it.</TE>
<TE>   The powerful White churns out four yards even when a hole is
plugged. He barrels over linebackers or safeties in the open field.
All he lacks is blazing speed.</TE>
<TE>   He's the same off the field, a pillar who charts his path with
mature, measured steps.</TE>
<TE>   "He's calm, cool and collected," Bruin fullback Pat Norton said.
"Nothing ruffles Manuel."</TE>
<TE>   White lives at home in Valencia with his parents, commuting to
UCLA each day. He's an honors student who spends free time either
with his girlfriend of five years or playing cards with teammates.</TE>
<TE>   His parents, Manuel Sr. and Charmaine, don't mind the extra
laundry and grocery bills. Their son reads the bible, goes to church
regularly and invites teammates over for home cooking and
camaraderie.</TE>
<TE>   "I do enjoy having him here," Charmaine said. "It's hard for kids
being away from home. We have quite a few [players] stay for the
weekend."</TE>
<TE>   White is the only sophomore on the player leadership council
formed by Coach Bob Toledo, who originally projected him two years
from now as an undisputed team leader.</TE>
<TE>   But the timetable is being accelerated. Toledo is ready to do the
White thing at tailback.</TE>
<TE>   "He's an excellent runner, a physical runner," the coach said.
"We've got to have Manuel on the field."</TE>
<TE>   White rushed for 76 yards in 14 carries against San Diego State
last week, a performance that made coaches take notice and made him
hungry for more.</TE>
<TE>   Even the unassuming White wonders what it would be like to get 25
carries in a game.</TE>
<TE>   "Once you get in a rhythm, it's like, 'Give me the ball,' " he
said. "I'm ready for that 20 to 25 carries. I think I'd just get
stronger."</TE>
<TE>   White started at fullback in the first four games. The smaller,
faster Akil Harris started at tailback, with White usually moving to
the position in the second half and pounding out yardage when the
defense was tiring. Redshirt freshmen tailbacks Tyler Ebell, Wendell
Mathis and Jason Harrison also have gotten carries.</TE>
<TE>   Harris struggled the last two games after running well in
victories over Colorado State and Oklahoma State. Meanwhile,
fullbacks Norton and J.D. Groves have recovered from injuries.</TE>
<TE>   So this week White (231 yards, 4.8 average) and Harris (215, 4.3)
are both listed as starters at tailback on the depth chart.</TE>
<TE>   Oh, and White is listed as starting fullback as well.</TE>
<TE>   "I wish I had another Manuel," Toledo said. "He can run or catch
as a fullback and as a tailback."</TE>
<TE>   White, who has seven catches for 78 yards, will be the lone back
in three-receiver sets and get more time at tailback in two-back
sets. But he will continue to play some fullback because he is
considered the best blocker among Bruin backs.</TE>
<TE>   "He's the best in every category, blocking, running and
receiving," Skipper said. "But Manuel's whole makeup is as a
tailback."</TE>
<TE>   That's what White has told anyone who would listen since high
school.</TE>
<TE>   When he entered Valencia, coaches pegged him as a basketball
player.</TE>
<TE>   Not interested.</TE>
<TE>   He rushed for 6,745 yards in three seasons and recruiters pegged
him as a linebacker.</TE>
<TE>   Not interested.</TE>
<TE>   "We tried to make him a defensive player and he didn't have the
instincts like he did at running back," Valencia Coach Brian Stiman
said. "He slips through small openings, sees the field well and
changes direction well for a large man."</TE>
<TE>   White chose UCLA in part because coaches told him he would not be
converted to defense.</TE>
<TE>   "They told me I'd play tailback," he said. "They've been honest
with me since I've been here. You don't always find that in college
coaches."</TE>
<TE>   After redshirting in 2000, he was third string last season behind
DeShaun Foster and Harris. Still, he appeared in every game and had
63 carries, rushing for 290 yards and three touchdowns. He also had
five receptions.</TE>
<TE>   After Foster was declared ineligible with three games to play,
White slowly gathered steam, scoring his first career touchdown
against Oregon, a one-yard run that gave UCLA a 20-14 lead.</TE>
<TE>   The season finale against Arizona State marked a breakout game for
him with 85 yards and two touchdowns in 17 carries.</TE>
<TE>   He thought he would enter fall camp competing with Harris at
tailback. But because last season's fullbacks, Matt Stanley and Ed
Ieremia-Stansbury, were seniors, coaches believed the best
combination was White at fullback and Harris at tailback.</TE>
<TE>   Now they are reevaluating, but none of it keeps White up at night.</TE>
<TE>   "Coach has a plan, and whatever that plan is, we're going to roll
with it," he said. "If they have me with 25 carries, that's fine. But
if it's less, I'm cool with that."</TE>
<TE>   Regardless of how he is used, he knows that his parents, sister
Kamilah, 23, Aunt Rosslyn and girlfriend, Maria Llamas, will be
there. They have been to every game the last two years, home and
road. The family's tailgate parties at the Rose Bowl are becoming
legendary.</TE>
<TE>   This year's opener against Colorado State began at 7:15 p.m.
Manuel Sr. was setting out tables and chairs on the Rose Bowl lawn at
10:30 a.m. Catfish, chicken and ribs are on the menu.</TE>
<TE>   "Manuel's daddy is a true fan," Charmaine said. "Usually he's
there at 9 a.m. And we stay after the game to greet the players as
they come out of the locker room to the tunnel."</TE>
<TE>   This family knows how to live large. And it appears the Bruins are
learning as well, making a key adjustment in the backfield in time
for the conference opener:</TE>
<TE>   Jumbo-size it.</TE>

<HD>Protection Practice Has Been Paying Off</HD>

<LD>UCLA is the only Division I-A team not to lose a fumble and has a
turnover ratio of plus-nine, fourth in the nation.</LD>
<LD>   The Bruins have fumbled eight times while opponents have fumbled
only five times. However, UCLA has recovered all eight of its fumbles
and all five of the opponents' fumbles.</LD>
<LD>   One of UCLA's fumbles came during an interception, and four were
kicks and punts that were dropped and picked up.</LD>
<TE>   The lack of fumbles is a departure from last season, when tailback
DeShaun Foster gained a reputation as a frequent fumbler.</TE>
<TE>   "We emphasize it in practice," Coach Bob Toledo said. "We are
protecting the football. Usually when you emphasize something you get
better at it."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Offensive tackle Mike Saffer is continuing his push to play
Saturday despite suffering from a broken rib.</TE>
<TE>   The Bruins will conduct a walk-through practice in Westwood on
Friday before flying to Oregon State, and trainers will determine
whether Saffer will make the trip.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Several Bruin freshmen caught leaving class early were required to
run sprints after practice as punishment.</TE>

<HD>Cornerback Rideaux Needs to Stand Tall</HD>
<DH>UP NEXT At Washington State Saturday, 4 p.m., TBS</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>USC cornerback Darrell Rideaux is looking forward to facing No. 17
Washington State on Saturday at Martin Stadium where the No. 18
Trojans have not played since 1999.</LD>
<LD>   Rideaux, a freshman at the time, recorded a career-high nine
tackles in a 31-28 victory.</LD>
<LD>   Three years later, Rideaux is part of a secondary that ranks first
in the nation in pass defense. The 5-foot, 9-inch senior expects a
major test from Washington State quarterback Jason Gesser, who will
be passing to 6-6 wide receiver Mike Bush and 6-3 flanker Devard
Darling.</LD>
<TE>   Said Rideaux: "I'm not worried because we work against 6-5 Mike
Williams in practice every day and, over the last four weeks, we've
developed some schemes to deal with height stuff.</TE>
<TE>   "I'll definitely be bringing my jumping shoes."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Senior wide receiver Kareem Kelly, who is second on USC's career
receptions list, ranks third this season behind junior flanker Keary
Colbert and freshman wide receiver Mike Williams.</TE>
<TE>   Colbert has 23 catches, Williams 16 and Kelly 14.</TE>
<TE>   Quarterback Carson Palmer said there isn't a pecking order once
the game begins.</TE>
<TE>   "You can't predetermine what player you're going to go to--it
slows down the offense and takes you out of your rhythm," Palmer
said. "You just get the ball to whoever is open. You're not looking
at faces or numbers."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Defensive end Omar Nazel did not practice again because of a sore
shoulder but will play against Washington State.... Left tackle Jacob
Rogers (right knee sprain) took part in most drills and will start on
Saturday.... Receiver Grant Mattos (abdominal strain) made it through
the entire practice and will play Saturday, Carroll said. Receiver
Jason Mitchell (stress fracture in back) is doubtful.</TE>

<HD>Cabrera's 55th Homer Ties Japanese Record</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>Associated Press</BD>
<DL>TOKYO</DL>
<LD>Alex Cabrera hit his 55th home run Wednesday, tying the Japanese
record set by Sadaharu Oh in 1964 and matched by Tuffy Rhodes last
year.</LD>
<LD>   Cabrera, formerly of the Arizona Diamondbacks, hit a solo homer in
the eighth inning of the Seibu Lions' 4-1 loss to the Kintetsu
Buffaloes.</LD>
<LD>   He tied the record in the 135th game of the 140-game season.</LD>
<TE>   "I feel so happy," Cabrera said. "I'll try for the record, and
I'll break it for all fans."</TE>
<TE>   Oh, manager of the Daiei Hawks, set the season record while
playing for the Yomiuri Giants. The Hawks play Seibu today.</TE>
<TE>   Cabrera, 31, had 49 homers last season. He leads the league with
55 homers and 115 runs batted in, and his .337 average is second to
the .338 of the Nippon Ham Fighters' Michihiro Ogasawara.</TE>
