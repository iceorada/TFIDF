<DH>Director Phillip Noyce went home again to find the voice
he'd lost.</DH>

<LD>Toronto</LD>
<LD>   When Phillip Noyce bounded into a restaurant one morning during
the film festival here this September, his shirttail hanging out and
shoes untied, the Australian director had the air of a man in
celluloid nirvana. Balled up in his fist, like a $100 bill, was a
rave Variety review of his new film, "The Quiet American," an
adaptation of Graham Greene's 1955 novel about the early days of U.S.
covert operations in Vietnam.</LD>
<LD>   The review not only praised the film's "power and sensitivity,"
but laid out a case for giving "Quiet American" a speedy release.
Miramax had been reluctant, believing it wouldn't play well in the
post-Sept. 11 political environment.</LD>
<TE>   Every time Noyce's cell phone rang during our interview, the
bear-like director would bellow, "Look at Variety -- it's amazing!"
When Michael Caine, the film's star, strolled in, Noyce greeted him
with glee, reading him the glowing assessment of his performance.
"That's great," Caine replied dryly. "But where are we having dinner
tonight?"</TE>
<TE>   Bolstered by positive reaction and quiet lobbying from Caine, the
film has a new lease on life; it opens Friday in Los Angeles for an
Oscar-qualifying run. But "The Quiet American," which took Noyce
years to get made, isn't the only movie close to his heart at the
moment. On Nov. 29, Miramax will also release the director's
"Rabbit-Proof Fence," which is based on the true-life saga of three
aboriginal girls who, in 1931, escaped from a government internment
camp and made the 1,500-mile trek back to their home. The warm
critical reception to the two films has buoyed Noyce's spirits.</TE>
<TE>   Noyce spoke candidly of his fears about "The Quiet American's"
fate. "Frankly, before Toronto, the film was dead, it just hadn't
been buried. Even I'd come to believe that the film was no good." He
unleashed a booming laugh. "Then suddenly we were exhumed!"</TE>
<TE>   Until he went off to make these two new films, you could have said
the same of Noyce's career. After making a name for himself in
Australia directing a string of politically and historically minded
films and TV miniseries, he had an international hit in 1989 with the
thriller "Dead Calm." Noyce moved to Los Angeles, where he became the
consummate Hollywood action director, making such films as "Patriot
Games," "Clear and Present Danger" and "The Saint."</TE>
<TE>   By 1999, Noyce had a reputation as a once-gifted storyteller
spoiled by studio largess. As David Thomson put it in his "New
Biographical Dictionary of Film," Noyce was "a truly promising
director who has acted out the ease of transition from real material
to movie bombast." From Noyce's perspective, life inside Hollywood's
velvet cocoon was sweet. In Australia, where film financing was
erratic at best, he'd been lucky to make three features in 12 years.</TE>
<TE>   "But here, as soon as I finished one movie, they'd have another
one lined up with lots of stars attached," he said over lunch,
sipping red wine. "My life was complete. I had a private phone number
that only [Paramount Chairman] Sherry Lansing and [Universal
Chairman] Stacey Snider had. I had a big car that could practically
drive itself. I had a house that Barbara Stanwyck had supposedly
lived in that overlooked the Hollywood sign, just in case I forgot
where I was. And I had a big wall around my house, because everyone
in L.A. needs a big wall.</TE>
<TE>   "The A-list scripts came into my office, pre-masticated by CAA. So
for 10 years I made one movie after another. And the beauty of the
system was that they sold the bad ones as well as the good ones. The
whole machine purred."</TE>
<TE>   Pandering to the A-list</TE>
<TE>   But not all was well. At one point, Noyce was smoking six packs of
cigarettes a day. When he went back home to Australia, he found
himself increasingly alienated from his old friends. "I became a
nowhere man," he says softly. "I wasn't an Australian, I wasn't an
American. I was living in a country where I was a migrant guest
worker -- the only political organization I was a member of was the
Directors Guild."</TE>
<TE>   Matters came to a head when Noyce was in New York in May 2000,
cajoling Harrison Ford to return as Jack Ryan in "The Sum of All
Fears." The actor had genuine concerns about playing the character
again and was vacillating, optimistic on a Monday, pessimistic on a
Wednesday. Noyce remembers being in a taxi in midtown Manhattan when
he snapped. "I'd become a waiter, waiting on a star," he recalls.</TE>
<TE>   "The whole of Hollywood is set up for the convenience of people
whose foreheads are stamped with an A. The rest of us just sit by the
phone waiting for their handlers to say they like a script. I'd call
up the studio and say, 'Harrison doesn't like this or that,' and
they'd say, 'For God's sake, fix it. Just get him to commit!' "</TE>
<TE>   As it happened, there was a very different sort of movie he wanted
to do. Noyce had been awoken in the middle of the night by a call
from Christine Olsen, an Australian writer who'd obtained the film
rights to "Follow the Rabbit-Proof Fence," a book about the
aboriginal girls' epic journey. Completed in 1907, the fence to which
the title refers was built as a barrier stretching between
Australia's north and south coasts to stop hordes of rabbits from
eating their way across the country. Around the same time, the
Australian government began to sanction the forcible removal of
mixed-race aboriginal children from their families, believing they
could be absorbed into white society. The victims became known as the
Stolen Generation.</TE>
<TE>   Olsen sent Noyce the script, but he was too focused on his
Hollywood blockbuster to pay any attention. "I was so out of touch
that when she said the story was about the Stolen Generation, I
thought it was a rock group." Noyce's production partner, Kathleen
McLaughlin, kept putting the script at the top of his stack until he
read it. Once he started, he couldn't stop.</TE>
<TE>   "I was moved beyond words by these girls finding their way across
miles of inhospitable country, and that what leads them home is this
fence built by their white fathers to keep rabbits out of the
country," he says. "Within five pages, these black children were my
children. I realized that as an Australian this was my story to tell
as well. This was our shared history."</TE>
<TE>   For Noyce, the country's exploitation of its aboriginal population
is as shameful as America's treatment of African Americans and native
Americans. "It's a horrible black mark," he says. "We've never wanted
to admit it because it's so completely at odds with our national
persona that we've sold to the rest of the world. We've always
pretended we were a cross between Mick Dundee and Michael Moore, that
we're a country of political radicals and social renegades."</TE>
<TE>   Making "Rabbit-Proof Fence" in the wilds of south Australia was a
radically different experience than filming a Hollywood thriller.
Noyce had a skimpy $6-million budget, the equivalent of what he alone
would have been paid if he'd directed "Sum of All Fears." Half came
from the Australian government, the rest from various investors,
including Noyce, his friend Peter Gabriel (who did the film's score),
families of the film's real-life aboriginal heroes and Kenneth
Branagh, who plays the autocratic administrator of reeducation
policy. Noyce cast three aboriginal girls in the leads, with Everlyn
Sampi playing the key role of Molly Craig, who is seen today -- at
age 85 -- in a clip at the film's end.</TE>
<TE>   The girls weren't just non-actors, they'd never seen a movie in a
theater. Noyce took them to see "Shanghai Noon," an education effort
that backfired. Everlyn ran away twice before filming began,
convinced that she could never live up to portraying the gigantic
images she'd seen.</TE>
<TE>   "Everlyn is very proud, and she hates to fail," Noyce recalls.
"After I calmed down, I realized that she was just like the real
character, someone whose self-respect told her to run away. And very
quickly I became the Kenneth Branagh character, mouthing the same
platitudes he does in the movie as I tried to corral her into coming
back."</TE>
<TE>   As soon as he finished "Rabbit-Proof Fence," Noyce threw himself
into making "The Quiet American," which he'd wanted to film ever
since he read the novel while vacationing in Vietnam. The project
remained in limbo until Caine and Brendan Fraser agreed to play the
leads.</TE>
<TE>   For the past few months, Noyce has been traveling the world,
promoting both movies. He feels rejuvenated by his journey of
self-discovery. It hardly seems coincidental that his most
anticipated new project involves another epic trek, an adaptation of
Thor Heyerdahl's "Kon-Tiki." Yet Noyce has no illusions about
completely leaving Hollywood behind. "Escaping Hollywood is
impossible," he says. "The issue is, are you going to be a director
for hire or are you going to tell your own stories? And having
rediscovered my Australian voice, I want to use it again."</TE>

<HD>Country and pop: Shania's twain meet</HD>
<DH>The singer's latest album doubles up, offering two discs
with the same vocals but different backings.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Robert Hilburn</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>With traces of everything from the Dixie Chicks to ABBA on Shania
Twain's first album in five years, it's easy to see why people have
trouble figuring out whether this auburn-haired mega-seller is a
country singer or a pop-rock performer.</LD>
<LD>   Whichever your vote, Twain lets you have it both ways on "UP!,"
which goes on sale today.</LD>
<LD>   In an unusual move, the Mercury Records collection contains two
discs for the price of one. Both discs have the same vocals, but the
green one features country arrangements of 19 new songs and the red
disc offers pop arrangements of the same songs.</LD>
<TE>   Recording artists, including Twain, frequently do specialized
versions of songs for different radio formats. But it is believed to
be unprecedented for an artist of Twain's sales stature to include an
entire disc of alternate versions in a new CD. Her last album, "Come
On Over," has sold more than 14 million copies in the U.S., the
biggest seller by any artist in the last decade.</TE>
<TE>   "Since I've always been comfortable writing and singing many
styles of music from the earliest age, I wanted this CD to reflect
that versatility," the Canadian singer writes in the package.</TE>
<TE>   Even if you miss the explanation, it should be easy to figure out
what is going on in "UP!" On the country disc, fiddles and steel
guitars are featured prominently on key tracks, while the pop
versions have been detwanged, with harder-edged guitars and strings
sometimes dominant.</TE>
<TE>   Both discs were produced by Twain's husband and co-writer, Robert
John "Mutt" Lange, who also oversaw a world music disc of the same
songs that will be included with the pop-rock version in copies of
"UP!" sold outside North America.</TE>
<TE>   "We talked about putting out two separate albums here, one with
the country disc and one with the pop disc, but we thought that could
be confusing," said Luke Lewis, the chairman of Mercury, MCA
Nashville and Lost Highway Records. "People might hear the pop or
country version on the radio and go into the store and buy the wrong
album. I thought the best solution was to put them both in the same
album."</TE>
<TE>   Lewis stressed that the decision -- which cost the label less than
$1 per copy for the extra disc -- was driven by the music rather than
by marketing.</TE>
<TE>   "Some retailers wanted to say, 'Buy one and get one free' in their
fliers, but we said no.... We don't want to make this look like a
gimmick," Lewis said. "From touring around the world, Shania has this
keen feeling that her audience is very varied and that some prefer
pop music and some prefer country in terms of instrumentation."</TE>
<TE>   So is she a better country stylist or pop-rock singer?</TE>
<TE>   Twain, who lives in Switzerland with her husband and their
year-old son, has a strong, serviceable voice, but she doesn't have a
lot of character as a singer. That makes her more appealing on the
country disc, where the instrumentation adds traces of personality
and warmth. The pop-rock backing is more generic, leaving her voice
colorless at times.</TE>
<TE>   Even as a country artist, she doesn't begin to match the soulful
depth of an Emmylou Harris or Lucinda Williams. But she shows more
convincing emotion than she did in 1995's "The Woman in Me" or 1997's
"Come On Over."</TE>
<TE>   There is finally a glimpse of the woman behind the voice in the
collection, which, fortunately, stays far from the diva-pop approach
of "Cry," the latest album from Twain's major country rival, Faith
Hill.</TE>
<TE>   In the heart of "UP!" Twain even approaches the feminist spirit
and playful swagger that make the Dixie Chicks so refreshing.</TE>
<TE>   "Waiter! Bring Me Water!" isn't as drastic a tale of revenge as
the Chicks' "Goodbye Earl," but it's still fun to hear how the woman
in the song cools down a boyfriend who's gawking at someone else in a
restaurant.</TE>
<TE>   The lively "C'est La Vie," which has a chorus reminiscent of
ABBA's "Dancing Queen," is a sweet reminder to young girls that
anything is now possible for them. The track gets bonus points for
rhyming "geologist" and "novelist."</TE>
<TE>   For all the album's emphasis on the upbeat (nine song titles are
followed by exclamation points), the real breakthrough for Twain is
in the gentleness of a series of love songs.</TE>
<TE>   In "Forever and for Always," especially, she expresses herself
with the understated conviction that helped make Garth Brooks' best
music so touching a decade ago.</TE>
<TE>   Twain, whose last two albums have kept credit-card lines humming
to the tune of $600 million, also shows a sense of humor. In a move
that is certainly going to bring a smile to the faces of retailers,
who are counting on this album to help boost holiday sales, Twain
titles one song "Ka-Ching!"</TE>

<HD>A firestorm over hallowed ground</HD>
<DH>Writer's account of the cleanup of the World Trade Center
and his implications about firefighters, others are a source of
outrage.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>J. Michael Kennedy</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The story of the folded blue jeans won't go away.</LD>
<LD>   It rankles the firefighters who read about it and say it just
could not have happened, not in all the chaos of the collapsing twin
towers of the World Trade Center, not with people jumping to their
deaths from offices.</LD>
<LD>   Yet there it is, vividly described in William Langewiesche's
much-lauded "American Ground: Unbuilding the World Trade Center." As
Langewiesche describes the event, a fire truck is pulled from the
rubble of the World Trade Center. Inside the cab are dozens of folded
jeans from the Gap, a store located in the center complex.</LD>
<TE>   His take on the scene: "It was hard to avoid the conclusion that
the looting had begun even before the first tower fell, and that
while hundreds of doomed firemen had climbed through the wounded
buildings, this particular crew had engaged in something else
entirely, of course without the slightest suspicion that the South
Tower was about to hammer down."</TE>
<TE>   The book, a compilation of a three-part series that first appeared
in the Atlantic Monthly, is among the most extensive looks at what
happened at ground zero in the aftermath of Sept. 11. But the
accusation of looting by firefighters has taken on a life of its own.
Just last week, New York Fire Commissioner Nicholas Scoppetta fired
off a lengthy letter to the Atlantic Monthly. In it, Scoppetta
characterized the book as containing "foolish, unfounded and absurd
accusations."</TE>
<TE>   "Such absurdity degrades men who valiantly died trying to save
lives," he wrote. "Such absurdity insults countless others who
devoted months to the dignified and respectful recovery of all
victims of the attacks. Such absurdity insults the truth."</TE>
<TE>   Langewiesche is adamant that he painted an accurate and fair
portrait of what happened that day: "I know it happened," he said
recently at a Pasadena restaurant, adding that the articles had been
fact-checked by meticulous researchers before they were published.</TE>
<TE>   The story, on the whole, is an odd one, embroiling a journalist
with impeccable credentials with a group of people who feel he
demeaned the New York City Fire Department. Langewiesche sees his
book as a celebration of Americans and their ability to get things
done and says it is much more than the "lock-stepped misty-eyed
patriotism" that television cameras sought out and nurtured after the
attacks.</TE>
<TE>   He also is frustrated that the jeans keep coming up as he makes a
15-city tour to promote his book, detracting from what has been
described as a great journalistic coup -- being the only journalist
who had complete access to ground zero in the months after Sept. 11.
On that day, Langewiesche was asleep at his home in Davis (he now
lives in Paris) when his wife awakened him with the news.</TE>
<TE>   "They're bombing New York," she told him.</TE>
<TE>   "Is it nuclear?" he asked.</TE>
<TE>   In a matter of minutes, Langewiesche was on the phone with Cullen
Murphy, Atlantic Monthly's managing editor, talking strategy. He
still had a piece to finish about the crash of Egypt Air Flight 990
(which later won a national magazine award). Every airline in the
United States was grounded. Should he go to Afghanistan or Ground
Zero? As he finished up the Egypt Air story, he decided on the World
Trade Center. He'd been in war zones before and had trouble
envisioning what he could do in Afghanistan that newspapers weren't
already covering.</TE>
<TE>   "It did seem like the World Trade Center cleanup had the potential
to be a more interesting piece that could not be covered by the
newspapers," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Langewiesche is very much a star at the Atlantic, though he came
to serious journalism somewhat late in life. From the time he
attended Stanford, Langewiesche had supported himself as an aircraft
pilot of everything from cargo planes to corporate jets.</TE>
<TE>   He traveled extensively and wrote for Flying magazine. His luck
took a turn when he submitted two unsolicited stories about the
Sahara to Atlantic Monthly in 1990. Normally, such stories are sure
candidates for rejection. But something about Langewiesche's style
struck a chord, and he was dispatched back to the Sahara to do more
reporting for a piece the magazine ran the following year. Soon he
became a national correspondent for the magazine.</TE>
<TE>   When he arrived in New York, he first went to the
media-credentialing area and found it overrun with hundreds of
reporters trying to get access to the site. He abandoned that tack
and, instead, sneaked onto the site when a National Guardsman was
looking the other way. As he later wrote: "People who came to the
site in those early days often had the same first sensation, of
leaving the city and walking into a dream. Many also felt when they
saw the extent of the destruction that they had stumbled into a war
zone."</TE>
<TE>   One thing Langewiesche discovered on that first day was that a
little-known government entity, the Department of Design and
Construction, was bringing in the heavy equipment. Langewiesche got
Atlantic's Murphy to fire off a fax to DDC Commissioner Kenneth
Holden, asking that Langewiesche be given access. In an amazingly
lucky stroke, it turned out Holden was a 20-year subscriber to
Atlantic Monthly and a Langewiesche fan to boot. He granted the
correspondent unrestricted access to write, as the author put it,
"history in the present tense."</TE>
<TE>   In the coming months, Langewiesche's uniform was that of the
construction worker -- jeans and work shirt, hard hat and respirator
draped around his neck. His new home became the Washington Square
Hotel in the heart of Greenwich Village. Each day he would wander the
site, not taking any notes for a number of weeks but simply observing
the process. He blended into the world of heavy-equipment operators,
firefighters and police as they worked to remove 1.5 million tons of
steel and debris, which Langewiesche described as the unbuilding of
the World Trade Center.</TE>
<TE>   Through it all, he said, he walked the fine line of not saying he
was a reporter but not denying it either. He attended planning
meetings and cruised the site for hours on end. He became a fixture
-- at least with certain workers -- at ground zero.</TE>
<TE>   One person he did not meet was Rhonda Roland Shearer, who, over
the nine months of cleanup, would give out, by her estimate, $3
million worth of donated equipment and supplies -- everything from
respirators to warm winter clothing. The artist and widow of Harvard
paleontologist Stephen Jay Gould would also become a vocal critic of
Langewiesche, promising to write her own history of what went on in
the months after Sept. 11. To that end, she has recruited a small
army of workers from the site, virtually all of them finding fault
with Langewiesche's work.</TE>
<TE>   In her enthusiasm to discredit Langewiesche, Shearer has compiled
an almost line-by-line dissection of "American Ground," much of it
strident. What she and others on the site say is that, if anything,
Langewiesche was almost too invisible -- that he was unknown to them
until the articles began to appear in the Atlantic.</TE>
<TE>   For instance, in one part of the book, he talks about the
retrieval of $250 million in gold and silver ingots from a vault
owned by the bank of Nova Scotia. In that passage, he said there was
evidence "that others had been there before," attempting to pry open
the vault's door and to cut in from above. Lt. Bill Keegan, the New
York police officer who supervised retrieval of the ingots, said
there was no evidence that anyone had tried to break into the vault.
"There had been absolutely no damage," he said. "We turned the
combination and the door popped open."</TE>
<TE>   But Keegan's larger question is why Langewiesche didn't simply
check with him: "Don't you have to talk to the lieutenant in charge?
I was there every single day for nine months and I never once met
this man."</TE>
<TE>   As for the case of the new jeans, Fire Lt. Russ Regan was present
at the site when the fire engine in question was pulled from the
wreckage.</TE>
<TE>   "There were some jeans on the truck and in the truck, but so was
everything else," he said. "The truck was 40 to 50 feet below street
level. There was everything everywhere -- jeans, asphalt, dirt and
rock. You name it. It's mind boggling to think that someone would say
that."</TE>
<TE>   The firefighters, of course, feel they have reason to be upset
with Langewiesche, who painted them as the most sanctimonious of the
three "tribes" that inhabited ground zero, the other two being police
and construction workers. He said they came to believe they were
heroes even though, in his view, they were not. But he doesn't fault
them, because the media subjected them to "the hurricane force of
hype." "It's very hard for them to have withstood the hype," he said.
"I know I couldn't have."</TE>
<TE>   As for Shearer, Langewiesche said he doesn't know her and never
talked to her.</TE>
<TE>   "I think there was a feeling among people who reacted negatively
that I was going out of my way to pick on the myth of the heroic
fireman," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The book, meanwhile, has generally won accolades and is selling
briskly, hitting the low 200s on Amazon's bestseller list.
Publisher's Weekly likened it to John Hersey's "Hiroshima," while the
New York Times ran two reviews, one critical, the other laudatory.
Certainly, it is a good piece of work in the eyes of Holden, who gave
Langewiesche the access he needed during the cleanup operation. "I
think it's excellent," he said. "It's a well-written, highly accurate
atmospheric depiction of what went down at the World Trade Center.
But it's clearly still a highly emotional issue with some people."</TE>
<TE>   Murphy, the Atlantic managing editor, said the fact-checking for
the stories took five months, using researchers who "tracked down
every detail through independent channels, and in the most sensitive
cases through more than one."</TE>
<TE>   "He has never had an agenda except to explain to his readers what
he has seen or learned as reliably as he can," said Murphy.</TE>
<TE>   As for Langewiesche, he has already moved on to another project,
one that he is not at liberty to discuss just yet. He said he
expected people to be upset by his book, but that is the price of
taking a different tack: "If you're singing out of tune from the rest
of the choir, it will make people upset."</TE>

<LD>It's hard to see the words "Junior Comedy Writing Workshop" and keep
a straight face. It's bad enough we've lured the preteen set into
coffeehouse culture with caramel-mocha Frappuccino and
chocolate-dipped madeleines (does anyone else find the sight of a
10-year-old sucking on a Starbucks cup almost as alarming as if it
were a bottle of beer?).</LD>
<LD>   Having done this, do we really want to see table after table
occupied by preteens hunched over laptops with their writing partners
trying to think of words with "kuh" sounds while banging out a spec
script for "Scrubs"?</LD>
<LD>   No, we do not. We want them out on the streets, shoving each
other, snickering helplessly as we walk by and otherwise acting out
in an age-appropriate manner. Yet, here was this workshop, offered on
a recent late Saturday afternoon by Storyopolis, a fairly
responsible, if not traditional, kids' bookstore on Robertson
Boulevard. Since it opened seven years ago, Storyopolis has tended
toward the extreme in children's bookstore behavior -- half of it is
an art gallery where one could meet genre notables like William Joyce
or buy a framed print of Dick and Jane on the run for $400.</LD>
<TE>   There's an event within its exposed-pipe, faux-loft walls almost
every weekend. (On the store's answering machine menu is a direction
for "all press-related calls," which is a bit odd for a bookstore,
even in L.A.) Two months ago, there was a mystery writers' workshop;
last month, a classic radio hour performance with actor and "Gosford
Park" producer Bob Balaban.</TE>
<TE>   Storyopolis is situated almost directly across from the Ivy,
making it perfect for such things. Conceivably, one could polish up a
draft about one's hilariously traditional Portuguese family at the
workshop, make a dinner-hour foray across the street and accidentally
drop the script at the feet of the nearest director-producer-spouse
of Tom Hanks on the way to the bathroom.</TE>
<TE>   Stranger things have happened, even to people who still need
parental permission to cross the street.</TE>
<TE>   The workshop is part of a series of "super-sized" events; that is,
they are geared for a more mature audience, one that has outgrown the
typical hand-puppet reading of "Where the Wild Things Are" and
"Eyeore Finds His Tail." Six and up, the fliers advise, and the
special guest star is Hillary B. Homzie, a genuinely published author
(the "Alien Clones From Outer Space" series), screenwriter and sketch
comedian. It would not be surprising to find some folks taking the
"and up" quite seriously, to see some waifish twenty- and
thirtysomethings slouching through the door, trying to hide their
tattoos behind the 200 pages they would just like a few notes on. A
workshop is a workshop, after all.</TE>
<TE>   And a few non-tattooed versions do show up, but they are mostly
friends of Homzie, the men trying to look nonpredatory as they kill
time surrounded by Madeline and Eloise. All the rest are kids, from
age 4 to maybe 12, a dozen or so, sitting on a big carpet toward the
back of the store, flipping through the script-like material Homzie
has prepared. Several of the kids belong to staff of the store but
most of them are here not because their parents think they may be the
next Nora Ephron but because it sounded like fun. And because it's
raining outside.</TE>
<TE>   Much has been written about the bizarre effect the rain has on
L.A. drivers, but it is nothing compared to what happens to L.A.
parents. No other group has such a strong sense of weather
entitlement as L.A. parents, and when that is threatened, when the
great outdoors is no longer an extension of our living rooms, we
panic. The children, of course, would be quite happy to just play in
the rain and the puddles and the mud, but we know, never mind what
all those dang studies say, we know that wet hair causes pneumonia
and pleurisy and rickets.</TE>
<TE>   So we keep them inside as long as our sanity holds and by 10 a.m.,
bundle them up and hurry them out to the car as if the light haze of
rain was nuclear fallout and take them somewhere. Anywhere. Kidspace
or the Science Center, the mall, the local cinema or McDonald's.
There is, of course, no children's museum in Los Angeles, and with
plans for the new one on hold, it seems there never will be, which is
why Chuck E. Cheese will never go out of business in this town.
Because parents need to take their kids somewhere, the bowling alley,
the nearest saloon, anywhere. Because they can't go outside because
it's raining.</TE>
<TE>   By 4 o'clock at Storyopolis, the rain has just about stopped, and
it is very clear Homzie knows exactly what she is doing. She has
degrees in children's literature and education as well as a lot of
hours logged behind a microphone, and she has taught comedy to kids
for years now. She finds that many kids have a gift for comedy, once
they learn the rules, and the only hard part is teaching them how to
revise. Little kids, she has found, can't grasp the concept of
revision, and big kids, teenagers, that is, often get too bored or
frustrated. "Middle school kids are the most receptive," she says. "I
think because so much of their own body is changing. They are in a
sort of physical revision, so it's easier for them to get it."</TE>
<TE>   She sets about teaching some of the simple rules of comedy,
especially the tried-and-true not-what-we-expect story line. Using
Cinderella and Red Riding Hood as examples, she encourages the kids
to think of the narrative possibilities if every assumption we had
about these tales was wrong, if Cinderella were anything but pretty
and nice, if the big bad wolf were something else entirely.</TE>
<TE>   The kids love it and soon are putting their big ideas on paper,
with the infectious glee of people who have never heard the words
"derivative" or "similar project over at Fox." One young man is so
excited by his creation, "Cinderfella," that his mother doesn't have
the heart to mention that it's been done. Hey, if they can remake
"Nutty Professor," they can remake "Cinderfella."</TE>
<TE>   There are many versions of Cinderella in space, so it's safe to
say the American blockbuster has nothing to fear from future
screenwriting generations (although if anyone else has ever seen an
amateur production of "Hamlet" done in space, they will know that
some classics, particularly costume dramas, are better left
earthbound). There is also a complicated, almost deconstructionist
version titled "Cinderella in the Finger Nail" written by a girl with
a strong and lovely chin and unwavering gaze who might have been 10
and who will undoubtedly win a Nobel Prize in something someday.</TE>
<TE>   After about 15 minutes, everyone gets to share their stories with
the group, and Homzie is very attentive and appreciative and
encouraging and nothing at all like any studio executive or newspaper
editor who has ever lived. For one thing, she lets the kids read
their stories all the way through, at their own pace, without
interrupting them. She even lets a couple make multiple pitches (one
young man makes three separate appearances, each with a new story to
tell, but then he is 4, and the store owner's son, and connections do
matter, no matter what the situation).</TE>
<TE>   For almost two hours the kids are in bliss, the parents are in
bliss and if they do not emerge quite prepared for a career in
writing, Homzie can always do a follow-up. Call it a Junior "You
Know, I Haven't Read It but I Think It Needs Work" Survival Workshop.
The kids may not appreciate it, but the parents will. Especially on a
day when the rain has revised all our fabulous plans.</TE>

<HD>Southwest Museum loses deal</HD>
<DH>Casino-owning Pechanga tribe backs away from plan to borrow
its artifacts.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Christopher Reynolds</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Pechanga Indians of Temecula, who in May paused on the brink of a
deal to borrow Native American artifacts from the cash-strapped
Southwest Museum in Los Angeles in exchange for up to $1.3 million
yearly, have backed away from the bargaining table.</LD>
<LD>   The ruptured deal appears to put the Southwest Museum's leaders
near square one in their efforts to find a financial angel. The talks
began in 2001, when the Pechangas shouldered aside the Autry Museum
of Western Heritage among the Southwest's suitors. But then the
proposed pact was placed before the Pechangas' general membership in
May, the tribe's members shied away, citing a shortage of details,
along with the price and restrictions attached to the deal.</LD>
<LD>   With the museum's offer effectively unchanged six months later,
said Pechanga spokesman Butch Murphy, the tribe's leaders chose in
early October to pull back from talks with the museum. Meanwhile,
however, the Pechangas have pushed forward efforts to gather
artifacts from other sources in preparation for building a new tribal
cultural center.</LD>
<TE>   A new proposal from Southwest might change things, said Murphy,
but as an example of the tribe's alternative efforts, he noted the
purchase of more than 1,100 items (including more than 200 baskets)
from Fullerton collector Justin Farmer. The Pechanga cultural
resources director, Gary DuBois, noted that though the purchase was
made in early 2002, the tribe has been working on that acquisition
for about three years, since well before its talks with the Southwest
Museum began.</TE>
<TE>   Southwest Museum officials had acknowledged that talks with the
Pechangas were stalled in early October, when they announced that the
Southwest was soliciting alternative proposals from other
institutions. In early November, Southwest executive director Duane
King said the museum had received no formal proposals and would
extend its deadline to Dec. 21. He added that the museum's day-to-day
operations would continue unchanged. King was unavailable for comment
Monday.</TE>
<TE>   The proposed deal would have given the Pechangas a chance to
borrow thousands of the Southwest Museum's artifacts, 98% of which
are held, unseen by visitors, in the Mount Washington facility's
storage rooms. To display the artifacts, the Pechangas proposed a
museum and cultural center of their own, which would rise near the
tribe's hotel and casino on the edge of Temecula. In exchange for the
loan of artifacts, the casino-wealthy tribe was to have provided
$750,000 yearly to the Southwest Museum for five years, then as much
as $1.3 million yearly once the items were on display at the
reservation.</TE>
<TE>   The Southwest Museum is the oldest museum in Los Angeles County,
and owns a widely admired 350,000-piece collection of Native American
art and artifacts from 18th, 19th and 20th centuries. But the
institution has suffered staff and board member turnover in recent
years, along with lagging attendance at its aged and isolated Mount
Washington location.</TE>

<LD>It's not even Thanksgiving yet, but Christmas bells are ringing at
KOST-FM (103.5). The station has set aside its regular format of soft
pop to play holiday music from now through Dec. 25.</LD>
<LD>   KOST did the same thing last year and saw its ratings in several
key demographic groups jump significantly over the previous year,
said station manager Jhani Kaye.</LD>

<HD>Infusion of funds saves 'Harlem Song'</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>"Harlem Song" has been saved.</LD>
<LD>   More than $300,000 from a variety of public and private sources
has come through for the musical revue, allowing the production to
complete its engagement this year at the historic Apollo Theater and
return next fall for a three-month run.</LD>
<LD>   "Happily, now 'Harlem Song' is paying for itself, or close to
paying for itself," producer John Schreiber said Monday, adding that
the $4-million production has more than broken even during the last
couple of weeks.</LD>
<TE>   Last month, Schreiber announced the show, a history of Harlem told
in song and dance, would have to close unless more money was
forthcoming to keep it running. Even though "Harlem Song" has been
seen by more than 70,000 theatergoers, it suffered substantial
financial losses since opening in August.</TE>
<TE>   The producer said the new infusion of cash came primarily from two
sources: the government-backed Upper Manhattan Empowerment Zone and
the New York City Investment Fund, a private fund.</TE>

<HD>Discarded woman's graceful evolution</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Bernadette Murphy</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>There's the coming-of-age novel, the first-love novel, the blossoming
family novel, even the middle-age, on-the-cusp-of-divorce novel, but
few works of fiction take seriously the perils and challenges, joys
and quiet surrender of the latter years. British writer Margaret
Drabble's lovely "The Seven Sisters" treads gently in this
oft-neglected territory, illuminating the rich texture and
thoughtfulness to be found there.</LD>
<LD>   Candida Wilton is in many ways a discarded woman. Having lived a
legion of carefully scripted years, she finds herself estranged from
her three adult daughters and cast aside by her longtime husband, who
has remarried. She leaves the comforts of her former life in quiet
Suffolk as the wife of a respected headmaster to begin anew, alone,
in a seedy part of London.</LD>
<LD>   With neither friends nor family nearby, she resides austerely,
walking graffiti-pocked streets, passing the drug addicts and drunks
that inhabit her neighborhood. "I don't like the pigeon mess, and the
old mattresses, and the broken bottles, and the people who lurk near
the bottle bank. My heart beats a little faster as I walk under those
two bridges."</LD>
<TE>   The past is gone. The opportunities of her earlier life,
particularly in relation to her children, are forever washed away.
"There is no way back to the shapeless tumble of the small nest of
hopeful and unfinished people that they once were," she writes in her
journal, the text of which constitutes the novel. "The reel cannot be
wound back. The cards cannot be put back in the pack."</TE>
<TE>   Candida's current choices are not a form of penance for the
unconscious life she'd previously lived. Rather, they represent a
kind of dilation of the self, an enlarging of her life to unforeseen
potential. "As a nun enters a convent in search of her god, so I
entered my solitude. I felt fear, and I felt hope."</TE>
<TE>   Initially, contacts with people in her new neighborhood are few.
Candida joins a class studying Virgil's "Aeneid," only to find it
disbanded when the building is to be redone into a health club. So as
to not be completely isolated from humanity, she joins the resultant
club; it's often the only place she hears her name aloud, the only
time she speaks with another person all day. "I know they know my
name only because it's written on my Club Pass ... but hearing it
does remind me of who I am."</TE>
<TE>   Moving gracefully through this paring-down process, Candida
eliminates all that's not necessary in an effort to discover that
which is vital. Female friends begin, ever so slowly, to populate her
life, and her intellectual curiosity, reignited by her brief study of
Virgil, is enkindled. Once released from the bondage of familial ties
and social obligations, her latter years begin to resemble her season
at boarding school, before the needs of men and children usurped her
energy. She again indulges the pleasures of learning, the joy of
female companionship and the nourishment found in one's self.</TE>
<TE>   "I should feel powerless, but I do not.... I feel more powerful
than I did when I was a new and beloved bride, than when I became
three times a mother and could rule over small lives. I cannot
explain this sense of power."</TE>
<TE>   Thanks to an unforeseen inheritance, Candida takes the impetuous
step of arranging a group trip for her budding cohort of friends, a
journey that will follow the mythical path of Aeneas from Carthage to
Naples and extend the women's study of Virgil. Together, these "seven
sisters," subtly representing the periods of Candida's life,
accompany her on an archetypal pilgrimage.</TE>
<TE>   Although the journey becomes the centerpiece of the book, the tale
of Candida's slow evolution as an individual offers the most
compelling writing. Unsentimental and sharply drawn, Drabble's
first-person narration of Candida's solitude is incisive,
demonstrating the way that the simplest daily activity, such as
shopping for one's dinner, can become utterly fresh and strange.
Artfully, Drabble captures the experience of shocking newness
commingled with sorrow, the uncertain balance between extant
potential and lost opportunities. We may read along to see what the
sibyl in the cave has to say to Candida, but we remain grateful for
the way Drabble has made Candida's inner journey the real story.</TE>
<TE>   Over the years, Drabble has created an impressive oeuvre with more
than a dozen novels (among them "The Peppered Moth" and "The Ice
Age") and numerous works of short fiction, many of which chronicle
the passage of her generation through time and seasons. Focusing now
on the inconstancies and richness of the aging life, she has again
shepherded to the page a fertile muse.</TE>

<KH>MUSIC REVIEW</KH>
<HD>Pianist Wild retains his wondrous natural touch</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Daniel Cariaga</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Earl Wild's last recitals here, in 1986 and 1991, were devoted to
Liszt and Chopin; in both cases, they were memorable and exhaustive
surveys of important music by each composer. When the 86-year-old
pianist returned, Sunday afternoon in Shumei Hall in Pasadena, his
eclectic program listed familiar pieces by six composers.</LD>
<LD>   But he thrilled his audience of nearly 500 as much as ever.</LD>
<LD>   Awesome virtuosity, communicative music-making and a modest stage
manner make Wild a most effective and admirable recitalist. A
pianistic giant, like his now-departed contemporaries Jorge Bolet and
Shura Cherkassky, he plays everything effortlessly and naturally, but
his technical feats, though he achieves them quietly, take the breath
away.</LD>
<TE>   For example, the closing work on this program was Liszt's second
Paganini etude, "La Capricciosa," a famous and frightening land mine
of a technical challenge, which he tossed off with insouciance.</TE>
<TE>   The encore that followed caused more gasping, not from speed or
dexterity, but for its sheer beauty; that was the Nocturne by
Ottorino Respighi, and it may have been the most touching moment of
the afternoon.</TE>
<TE>   There were others, however. For the many pianists in the room,
there was the kaleidoscopic breadth of one of the peaks of the
repertory, Beethoven's 32 Variations in C minor. For lovers of
old-fashioned chestnuts, there was a gorgeously controlled Rondo
Capriccioso by Mendelssohn.</TE>
<TE>   For definitive and heart-melting Chopin, Wild's group of the
A-flat Ballade, the B-minor Mazurka, Opus 33, No. 4, and the
Fantaisie-Impromptu created deeply impressed aural memories.</TE>
<TE>   At the beginning there was Wild's wondrous realization of an
Adagio by Alessandro Marcello, and just before the end, he
demonstrated his legendary technique and sumptuous tone in Liszt's
"La Ricordanza" and "Les jeux d'eau a la Villa d'Este." He is one of
a kind.</TE>

<HD>In road show, Metheny is all about technique</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Don Heckman</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Guitarist Pat Metheny has been a legendary road warrior. For a
15-year period in the 1970s and '80s, he spent most of his time on
tour, totaling nearly 900,000 miles in his band's travel van. These
days, still traveling almost incessantly, he journeys in considerably
more luxurious comfort. On Saturday night, while his group was
preparing for a Royce Hall concert, the backstage parking area was
filled with two huge, elegant-looking buses and a pair of enormous
18-wheeler trucks -- all dedicated to the comfort and the transport
of a six-piece band.</LD>
<LD>   The up side of virtually continual touring is the establishment of
a large, supportive listener base. In Metheny's case, the result was
a sold-out house for the UCLA event, which ran for three hours
without an intermission. The down side of night after night of
concertizing is that it allows little room to try out new material
and find new interpretations of old material. In fact, for a jazz
artist, the irony of the increased popularity generated by touring is
the fact that -- as with pop music -- it tends to enhance the need to
play songs with as little variation as possible from the
audience-friendly, recorded versions.</LD>
<TE>   In that sense, it was fascinating to compare the Metheny group's
Royce Hall performance with an appearance earlier this year at
Universal Amphitheatre before a considerably larger crowd. Not only
was the material similar, but so, too, were the performances, as well
as the amiable Metheny's brief remarks to his listeners. In both
cases, craftsmanship tended to take precedence over imaginativeness,
with the occasionally adventurous moments of the Universal
performance morphing into what was -- especially on Metheny's part --
largely a display of technical virtuosity.</TE>
<TE>   Moving from one instrument to another -- including a few numbers
on his 42-string Pikasso guitar and the sweet-sounding soprano
acoustic guitar -- he seemed determined to jam as many notes as
possible into every measure. Initially exciting, the fast-fingered
displays soon became distracting, especially when they were applied
to more pensive pieces such as Antonio Carlos Jobim's "Insensitive."</TE>
<TE>   By the time the lengthy set had concluded, it was not the facile
predictability of the Metheny jazz fusion sound generated by the core
trio of longtime associates Metheny, pianist Lyle Mays and bassist
Steve Rodby that remained in memory. Far more captivating were the
spontaneous solo efforts of the newer, less road-hardened players:
bassist, singer and multi-instrumentalist Richard Bona, trumpeter and
singer Cuong Vu, and drummer Antonio Sanchez.</TE>

<HD>Fox chief advised Bush, book says</HD>
<DH>Roger Ailes, former media advisor to the president's
father, sent a 9/11 memo, according to 'Bush at War.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Elizabeth Jensen</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The new book "Bush at War," by Washington Post assistant managing
editor Bob Woodward, says Fox News Chairman Roger Ailes offered
advice to President Bush in the aftermath of the Sept. 11 attacks.</LD>
<LD>   Ailes is a former media advisor to Bush's father and other
prominent Republicans, but he said he left politics when he took the
job at the Fox News Channel.</LD>
<LD>   According to a report that ran Saturday in the Post, Ailes sent
his memo to Bush senior advisor Karl Rove, who took it to the
president.</LD>
<TE>   The Post wrote: "His back-channel message: 'The American public
would tolerate waiting and would be patient, but only as long as they
were convinced that Bush was using the harshest measures possible,' "
Woodward wrote. The Post reported that Ailes also "added a warning:
'Support would dissipate if the public did not see Bush acting
harshly.' "</TE>
<TE>   Ailes released a statement Monday that said, "In the days
following 9/11, our country came together in nonpartisan support of
the president. During that time, I wrote a personal note to a White
House staff member as a concerned American, expressing my outrage
about the attacks on our country. I did not give up my American
citizenship to take this job."</TE>
<TE>   Fox rival CNN devoted part of its Monday "TalkBack Live" to the
topic. One guest, historian Douglas Brinkley, said the report "does
show that Fox News is very close to the White House." Fox's claim to
be "fair and balanced," he said, "is a lot of bunk." But conservative
radio host Armstrong Williams, defended Ailes, suggesting that it's
not uncommon for news executives to be close to politicians.. He
noted that former CNN executive Rick Kaplan was a close confidant to
President Bill Clinton.</TE>

<LD>Adrianna Lis, 26, is principal flute with the American Youth
Symphony. Born and raised in Poland, she began playing the flute at
age 13 and has won many awards. She moved to the United States four
years ago to study at USC. Lis will appear with the American Youth
Symphony on Sunday at UCLA's Royce Hall. Here she talks about how she
got started playing this musical instrument.</LD>
<LD>   As a kid, I saw a video of a flutist and fell in love with the
instrument -- it sounded so sweet. I got mad in the beginning because
I made horrible airy sounds. It didn't sound the way I wanted it to.
My teacher kept encouraging me, and I finally got better. I urge kids
learning to play an instrument to practice every day, even if it's
only for 15 minutes.</LD>
<LD>   On my first trip to the United States, I auditioned at USC and was
accepted into the advanced music program. When I moved here, I didn't
speak English and I had no place to live, but three days later, I was
one of 40 flutists auditioning for the American Youth Symphony. I had
no idea what the conductor, Alexander Treger, said to me during the
audition, but I got in!</LD>
<TE>   I haven't seen my family in three years. Although I've thought
about returning, one of my mentors here encouraged me to stay. He
said there would always be a place for me in music in America.</TE>

<HD>A matinee idol finds his inner mean streak</HD>
<DH>Frequent romantic lead Morris Chestnut gets to portray his
first villain in the action-thriller 'Half Past Dead.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Susan King</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Thanks to his graceful ease playing leading men in romantic comedies,
Morris Chestnut has developed into a matinee idol among African
American women. During the production of the 1999 film "The Best
Man," the makeup artists nicknamed him "Dark Gable" -- and this was
before his roles in "The Brothers" and "Two Can Play That Game," both
of which came out last year.</LD>
<LD>   But the handsome 33-year-old Cerritos native actually brings to
mind Billy Dee Williams, who achieved heartthrob status in the 1970s,
more than Clark Gable. Chestnut, the happily married father of two
young children, says being cast as the romantic leading man has been
a blessing and a curse. "There have been roles I wouldn't be
considered for because producers think I wouldn't be edgy enough,"
Chestnut explains during a recent interview. "They don't see me as
having a mean streak within me, so they don't give me an
opportunity."</LD>
<LD>   Until now.</LD>
<TE>   Chestnut gets the opportunity to play his first bad guy in the new
Steven Seagal action-thriller, "Half Past Dead," which opens today.
With his shaved head and "Matrix"-style long coat, Chestnut plays
Donny, a disgruntled prison official who, with a band of cutthroats,
attempts to kidnap a death row prisoner (Bruce Weitz) who has hidden
$200 million worth of gold. Seagal plays an FBI agent deep undercover
as a prisoner.</TE>
<TE>   It was Clint Culpepper, the head of Screen Gems, who tapped
Chestnut for the role of Donny. Culpepper is a real champion of
Chestnut, whom he has cast in four Screen Gems productions.</TE>
<TE>   "I am always looking for stuff for him," Culpepper says. "I wanted
him to play edgy because he is thought of as a kind of romantic
comedian. I know that ultimately he wants to do action. I thought
this would be a challenge for him as an actor and would not only help
him as an actor but show a different side."</TE>
<TE>   The film's writer-director, Don Michael Paul, acknowledges he
wrote the part for a white actor. But, he says, "I wanted to somehow
make this movie a little bit more accessible to a moviegoing
generation that really isn't aware of Steven Seagal."</TE>
<TE>   Chestnut underplays Donny, bringing a cold, quiet, menacing
quality to the character. "That's how I saw him," Chestnut says. "But
I was a little concerned because Steven kind of underplays a lot of
his roles, and we are not in a lot of scenes together, so I didn't
want to the movie to seem it was me underplaying and then him
underplaying."</TE>
<TE>   Paul says Chestnut embraced his role as the movie's chief villain.
"He did exactly what he should have done, which is not to bang the
nail on the head," says the director. "It would have been really easy
... to play all the intensity and to be the leering kind of
snickering bad guy. He felt like a guy who is very in control of his
emotions. He barely raised his voice. He was very in command and in
control and sophisticated."</TE>
<TE>   "Half Past Dead" was a difficult shoot, Chestnut says.</TE>
<TE>   "We were in Germany and at first we were losing days because of
the communication barrier," he says. Additionally, the real prison
location in Berlin was dirty and depressing. Chestnut also found the
people in Germany not to be very warm. "Just walking up and down the
streets, no one is really smiling, and when you are in that cold of a
prison and so filthy, it is just kind of a weird feeling."</TE>
<TE>   Chestnut is hobbling around in crutches in his hotel suite in
Beverly Hills, having torn his Achilles tendon a month earlier during
a basketball game. "I had surgery the week after the injury," he
explains. "I was in a splint and two weeks ago I got this cast, and
tomorrow I get another cast. I can't start playing basketball again
for two or three months. This is the first time I have ever had a
cast on or crutches."</TE>
<TE>   Throughout high school, Chestnut played basketball and football,
with the latter being his first love.</TE>
<TE>   "I wanted a football scholarship, but I told myself if I didn't
get a football scholarship I wouldn't try to walk on for tryouts
because there are too many politics involved."</TE>
<TE>   When the scholarship didn't happen, Chestnut enrolled at Long
Beach City College undecided about what to do with his life. "I was a
bank teller after I graduated from high school, so I thought, 'I can
be a bank teller or a bank manager.' "</TE>
<TE>   He caught the acting bug when a friend from English class invited
Chestnut to see him in a school play.</TE>
<TE>   "It was like, "Wow,' " Chestnut recalls. "I looked around and the
girl I was with was checking him out. So the next semester I took an
acting 101 class. I liked it and pursued it."</TE>
<TE>   He got his first big break playing the role of doomed Ricky
opposite Ice Cube and Cuba Gooding Jr. in John Singleton's acclaimed
1991 film, "Boyz N the Hood." Though Chestnut was thrilled with the
film's success, he was green behind the ears when it came to his
career.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't have confidence in what I was doing," he says. "All of a
sudden I went from someone who was not recognizable to I would be
walking in malls and people were calling me by the character."</TE>
<TE>   Instead of trying to build a screen career on the momentum of
"Boyz," Chestnut says he made a big mistake when he decided to do the
short-lived NBC sitcom "Open All Night."</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't know anything about the industry and how to handle
myself," Chestnut says. But over the past decade, he's learned. "I
persevered and I'm still here."</TE>

<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>I had a busy weekend in New York during the rainy season, and my
shoes squished everywhere I went. But when it was over, I'd seen
Julianne Moore on-screen in the highly overrated "Far From Heaven" (a
campy exercise, where they drive vintage '50s-type cars through
autumn leaves and telegraph everything about to happen in a totally
artificial world) and then in person in the Cipriani having supper
Sunday night.</LD>
<LD>   In the afternoon, I experienced "Harry Potter and the Chamber of
Secrets" and had to have a 4-year-old explain it to me. ("Lizzie," he
said impatiently, "it's just all about magic -- and power!")</LD>
<LD>   During this eventful 48 hours, I went to a private dinner uptown
for a film director who never wants me to write his name. But while
that went on, I had a lot of fun with Evelyn de Rothschild and his
all-American wife, Lynn Forester, because Evelyn knows everything
there is to know about the British royals and can discuss them
without resorting to gossip. (The realities are better than the
rumors.)</LD>
<TE>   Topping off the slushy, icy weekend was Mike Nichols' production
of "Short Talks on the Universe," a benefit that featured some of
America's best writers and actors.</TE>
<TE>   Matthew Broderick, dressed as the devil, and Tony Roberts as a
Broadway producer were my two favorites in hell, as envisioned by
playwright Jon Robin Baitz.</TE>
<TE>   Then, there was the one and only Bette Midler performing Nora
Ephron's "I Hate My Purse," plus Alec Baldwin and Ellen Barkin in a
windup of two lost souls at a cocktail party, dreamed up by Elaine
May.</TE>

<HD>Web site sells plus-size clothes that are ahead of the
curve</HD>
<DH>Two sisters provide fashions for women who wear size 14 or
larger, the 'fastest-growing sector of retail.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Booth Moore</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Santa Monica is a magnet for pumped-up bods and string beans in
string bikinis. But out of what is surely one of the most
body-conscious cities in the world comes SizeAppeal, an online
clothing retailer providing the same throwaway chic found at stores
like Rampage and Forever 21, which cater to the young and svelte. In
this case, though, the clothes are distinctly for the plus-size set.</LD>
<LD>   The slick Web site, www.size appeal.com, offers something
refreshing in the plus-size clothing market: sexy, up-to-the-moment
looks such as a slinky black V-neck spandex dress with
three-quarter-length scalloped sleeves ($50), a western-inspired
camel-colored micro-suede skirt with a fringed hem ($48) and an
animal-print peasant blouse with bell sleeves and crochet trim ($39).</LD>
<LD>   With more than half of all U.S. women wearing size 14 or larger,
more and more mainstream stores are following Ann Taylor, Lands' End
and Gap in offering an expanded range of sizes. "It's the
fastest-growing sector of retail," said Caron Kovoloff, 45, who
co-founded SizeAppeal with her sister Linzi Glass, 43. The pair grew
up in South Africa. Until they started the business, Glass was a
literary agent for CAA; Kovoloff did not work outside the home.</LD>
<TE>   Even though they are joining what the sisters like to call "the
curvy revolution," many stores are still offering matronly plus-size
styles.</TE>
<TE>   "If you are looking for big, baggy clothes, this isn't the place
for you," said Kovoloff, who is plus size but prefers not to name a
number. "We're doing the same trendy clothes as Rampage, Wet Seal and
stores like that, just a little bigger."</TE>
<TE>   SizeAppeal carries sizes 14 through 26 and 1x through 5x, and new
pieces are added to the Web site each week to keep styles up to date.
Customers, say the sisters, range in age from 17 to 35.</TE>
<TE>   The business started almost accidentally. After Kovoloff's husband
died of a heart attack three years ago, she began to sell her own
household objects on eBay as a hobby, first posting salt and pepper
shakers and cookie jars on the auction site, then clothes. Over the
years, she had amassed a collection of dressy clothes for the
Hollywood parties she attended with her husband, a product placement
consultant for movie studios. She posted a few of her black-tie gowns
and couldn't believe the response.</TE>
<TE>   "I sold everything within a week," said Kovoloff, dressed on a
recent afternoon at her Santa Monica office in a beaded and fringed
top and black stretch pants. "And before I knew it, there was a group
of women e-mailing me, asking me for fashion advice."</TE>
<TE>   Soon after, she began making weekly trips to the Fashion District
in downtown L.A. to purchase plus-size clothing from shops around
Santee Alley to sell on eBay. She looked for and found plus-size
pieces that were sexy, including a body-skimming pink halter number
she dubbed the " 'Sex and the City' dress."</TE>
<TE>   "I had so many eBay hits with that dress, I knew I had a
business," said Kovoloff, who tapped her sister to do the marketing
and her daughter Lori, 23, to design the clothes, which are
manufactured in New York and L.A. The SizeAppeal site was launched
with $6,000 in August 2000 and took off quickly, with editorial
credits in Glamour, YM, InStyle and Grace magazines and an appearance
by Kovoloff and Glass on "The Today Show" this fall.</TE>
<TE>   Glass said the Web site gets more than 3 million hits a month and
that SizeAppeal.com has evolved into a community for plus-size women.
Glass writes a trend watch column; the site is sponsoring a clothing
naming contest and a plus-size model search. The company recently
started wholesaling clothing in Canada and Saudi Arabia. The sisters
have also been in discussions about whether to open stores in malls.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Kovoloff has been thrust into the forefront of her own
curvy revolution. "For me, it used to be a taboo thing to talk about
my weight. But now I'm happy to be visible," she said, adding that
appreciative e-mails from customers have made the experience most
worthwhile. "Every day we have someone who writes in to say, 'Where
were you when I was in high school?' "</TE>

<HD>Just traveling through</HD>
<DH>A largely unimaginative New York exhibition on worldwide
trends in hotel design presents a partly obstructed view of a
tantalizing subject.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Nicolai Ouroussoff</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>NEW YORK -- One of the best moments in "New Hotels for Global
Nomads," the current show at the Smithsonian Institution's
Cooper-Hewitt National Design Museum, is a music video directed by
Spike Jonze. The video shows actor Christopher Walken tap-dancing
through a hotel lobby -- a generic, sterile space otherwise devoid of
human life. At one point Walken lifts off the ground and soars across
the room as if in a reverie. A moment later he sinks back into an
armchair, his face blank and expressionless.</LD>
<LD>   The sequence of images captures the aura that can make hotels such
tantalizing social spaces. Anonymity, freedom, loneliness -- a tinge
of eroticism -- these are the qualities that give hotels their
particular frisson. In recent years, architects have tapped into
these themes with an imaginative fervor that hasn't been seen in
decades.</LD>
<LD>   Unfortunately, such moments are rare in this exhibition. Divided
into seemingly random categories, such as "Urban Hotels," "Fantasy
Hotels" and "Hotels on the Move," the show includes six full-scale
installations by a range of architects and artists, photos, videos
and architectural models.</LD>
<TE>   The result is a confusing assortment of often dull, predictable
images. The exhibition opens at the end of a 10-year period that was
one of the most inventive in the history of hotel design. Yet it
jumps around from experimental, contemporary hotel designs to
artists' interpretations of hotel travel and turn-of-the-century
lodges. What's totally missing is the kind of curatorial insight that
could have given the show some meaning.</TE>
<TE>   Nonetheless, there are a few notable highlights. Among the oddest
are the Japanese "capsule hotels," which date to the 1970s and were
an effort to accommodate business travelers in dense urban centers at
minimal cost. The show includes a full-scale replica of one such
capsule, its molded shell just big enough to house a single reclining
guest. The capsule evokes the distant age of space travel. But it is
also an example of capitalist efficiency taken to an extreme, a model
of alienation for the Willy Lomans of the world.</TE>
<TE>   Other examples offer a more decadent view of hotel culture. A
series of photos by Peter Marlow depict a typical Japanese "love
hotel." The photos show vending machines for sex toys, and patrons
paying bills from behind glass screens to preserve their anonymity.
(In the real version, hotel staff even offer black plastic license
plate covers.) The hotels, which arose in the 1950s, are perfect
emblems for a repressed society -- one in which illicit pleasures are
never allowed to pierce the veneer of social conformity.</TE>
<TE>   With the emergence of boutique hotels in the late 1980s, however,
public voyeurism begins to replace anonymity as a central theme in
hotel design. One of the earliest examples of this trend was hotelier
Ian Schrager's Royalton, which opened in 1988. Designed by Philippe
Starck, the Royalton's cool sensuality -- marked by minimal lighting,
lush surfaces and furniture that was meant to evoke obscure objets
d'art -- was a place where Manhattan's fashionable set was less
likely to sneak off for casual afternoon sex than to be found blowing
air kisses in the hotel's upscale restaurant.</TE>
<TE>   The Royalton, unfortunately, is missing from the show, as is its
West Coast version, the Mondrian, which opened in 1996. Instead, in a
telling example of the show's inability to gauge the global
zeitgeist, past or present, three later Schrager hotels are included
-- San Francisco's Clift and two hotels in London, the Sanderson and
St. Martins Lane. None is as pivotal or as sexy as the Royalton.</TE>
<TE>   Included is Koning Eizenberg's design for L.A.'s Downtown Standard
Hotel -- a more provocative take on the boutique theme, but it is
unclear from the exhibition what makes it so. The hotel's rooftop
terrace offers a surreal skyline view that seems out of place in Los
Angeles and has made it a gathering spot for twentysomething
hipsters. The bedrooms are a voyeur's private fantasy, with bathrooms
enclosed entirely in glass and views into nearby office buildings.
But what you get in the show are slick pictures of the retro,
1960s-era decor.</TE>
<TE>   The show does a better job with a number of theoretical hotels for
the ecologically conscious. There are several projects by New
York-based Lindy Roy, including a 2001 proposal for the Wind River
Lodge outside Valdez, Alaska. The proposal's compact, cross-shaped
plan and sleek curvilinear forms -- complete with twin helipads --
give it a paramilitary look, as if it were the launchpad for an
invasion. Dutch architect Dre Wapenaar's 1998 "Tree Tents," on the
other hand, are designed to hang off the side of a tree trunk like
enormous ripe fruit. They would make an ideal sanctuary for a group
of environmental activists.</TE>
<TE>   But such works quickly get lost in the bric-a-brac that surrounds
them. Many of us surely would like to own the Louis Vuitton luggage
that the luxury goods company designed in 1936 for Leopold Stokowski,
with its fold-away table and bookshelves. But what does it really say
about the evolution of the contemporary hotel?</TE>
<TE>   What the exhibition is missing is a clearer sense of historical
context. One of the show's most powerful images, for example, is a
1999 photo by Andreas Gursky of a hotel atrium in Taipei, Taiwan. The
hotel's monotonous rows of balconies, bathed in a harsh light, could
just as well represent the interior of a suburban corporate
headquarters building or a minimum-security prison.</TE>
<TE>   That image could have served as a jumping-off point for a more
intriguing show. In her 2001 book "Building the Cold War," Annabel
Jane Wharton points out how the Hilton hotels of the 1950s and '60s
served as monuments to American corporate power and its global reach.
Their uniform modernity gave that power a progressive veneer.</TE>
<TE>   The boutique hotels of the '80s and '90s can be seen as a response
to those earlier models -- and they cater to a very different
clientele. Unlike their white-collar predecessors, the new global
nomads are more obsessed with glamour than with wielding influence.
The currency they share is the hunger for celebrity, not an
unyielding belief in the superiority of the American way of life.
What both have in common, perhaps, is a lack of genuine cultural
curiosity.</TE>
<TE>   But the Cooper-Hewitt exhibition never bothers to make such
connections. And in any case, that moment may also be past. A year
and a half ago, during a visit to Los Angeles, Schrager suggested
that the boutique hotel had had its run. "I'm starting to look back
at the old Hiltons," he said, "big, anonymous spaces. I think they
may be the next wave."</TE>
<TE>   A few months later, terrorist attacks destroyed the World Trade
Center, and the hotel business still has not fully recovered.</TE>
<TE>   Schrager abandoned his plan to build an elaborate new Frank
Gehry-designed hotel at Manhattan's Astor Place. Andre Balazs'
proposed New York hotel, designed by the celebrated French architect
Jean Nouvel, is being re-conceived as an apartment complex.</TE>
<TE>   One is left to wonder, in such a context, what the next wave of
hotel design will bring us. You won't find the answer here.</TE>

<DH>LAPD chief Bill Bratton schmoozes with billionaires, judges
and A-list entertainers.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Gina Piccalo</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Just three weeks into the job, L.A.'s head crime-fighter, Bill
Bratton, is already making his mark on the party circuit, moving from
one fete to another where, it seems, everyone is eager to win him
over. In fact, the invites are so plentiful, he said, "I actually
lose track of the functions."</LD>
<LD>   It's a tough job, but somebody's got to do it.</LD>
<LD>   On Thursday night at the Fulfillment Fund gala, hosted by News
Corp. Chairman Rupert Murdoch and held on a glamorously draped 20th
Century Fox soundstage, Bratton sat in the golden circle of
billionaires. Haim Saban was just behind him, Marvin and Barbara
Davis at a table to his left. Bratton's escort for the evening was
entertainment attorney Howard Weitzman, whose clients have included
Michael Jackson, Ozzy Osbourne and Sean Penn.</LD>
<TE>   "We're so excited that he can help us that we're all rushing in,"
said Weitzman's wife, Margaret. "He's having his debutante ball!"</TE>
<TE>   (Three nights later, the Weitzmans opened their Pacific Palisades
home to honor Bratton and his wife, Court TV anchor Rikki Klieman, an
old friend, with an intimate party of actors, studio execs and
judges. On Wednesday, the Bratton party moves to the home of former
chief executive of Universal Studios and Viacom Inc. Frank Biondi and
his wife, Carol.)</TE>
<TE>   Weitzman led Bratton to Murdoch, then Annette Bening. As Cindy
Crawford chatted about her new infomercial, the chief exchanged
witticisms with Bening, whose smirking husband, Warren Beatty, stood
nearby.</TE>
<TE>   "One of the great things about the job of police chief is that you
get to travel in so many circles," Bratton said early on in the
evening. "I start my day in an impoverished neighborhood and end my
day at a function like this. Later, I'll go back to the office."</TE>
<TE>   He said Thursday began with a 1 a.m. helicopter tour of the San
Fernando Valley. At some point, he spotted crews filming ABC's update
on the classic cop show "Dragnet," so he stopped by to say hello to
the show's creator, Dick Wolf.</TE>
<TE>   During dinner (salmon and caviar), but long before Roger Daltrey
took the stage, a series of wealthy well-wishers stopped by Bratton's
table to welcome him to the job. "You've gotten a tremendous start!"
said investor John Kissick, chucking Bratton on the back and shaking
his hand.</TE>
<TE>   Moments later, Kissick was honored for donating $2 million to the
charity, a mentoring and scholarship program for economically
disadvantaged students.Saturday night the party was at the newly
renovated Sowden House, a $4-million Decoziggurat in Los Feliz
designed in 1926 by Lloyd Wright. Here, the crowd was decidedly low
on billionaires and the mood mellow. A jazz band performed standards
from the master bedroom, which opened onto the colorfully lighted
pool. Journalists hovered around Bratton and Klieman. "I grew up fah
from where the Kennedys were from," Bratton told someone in his thick
Boston accent.</TE>
<TE>   Later, he announced to the crowd that he and Klieman would be
making Los Feliz their home. "L.A. is a great city," he said, "and
it's going to be the safest city." At least in his new neighborhood,
some murmured.</TE>
<TE>   It was the third party of the week at the spectacular house, owned
by real estate entrepreneur Xorin Balbes. Writer Cliff Rothman
organized the event, a fund-raiser for several Los Angeles Police
Foundation programs that drew journalists, agents and publicists, as
well as police investigators, uniformed officers and Dist. Atty.
Steve Cooley.</TE>
<TE>   Cooley said he met the police chief two weeks ago and has yet to
sit down with him for a formal conversation. That said, however,
Cooley already recognizes the man as "a visionary. He definitely is
confident. Very quickly he's made an impact."</TE>
<TE>   Dozens of entertainment industry folks lingered around the pool
and a free-standing fire pit, sipping cocktails with glow-in-the-dark
ice cubes. "This is like 'Raiders of the Lost Ark,' " said one guest,
staring at the home's exotic accents. "But more tasteful."</TE>

<LD>Broadway Inner Circle, the New York ticket service that created a
stir a year ago by announcing a $480 top price for "The Producers,"
has added two Disney shows to its roster.</LD>
<LD>   The Broadway Inner Circle "Lion King" tickets will go for $240 and
"Aida" tickets for $180 -- which are the two prices that are in
effect for most of the 12 productions on the company's list.</LD>
<LD>   The only exception remains "The Producers," whose top tickets
still cost $480 but a $240 price also is offered.</LD>
<TE>   Broadway Inner Circle tickets are designed to undercut the

<AU>Brian Lowry</AU>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Facing the prospect of being grounded by Fox, "Grounded for Life" has
found a second life on the WB network.</LD>
<LD>   The comedy series, starring Donal Logue and Megyn Price as parents
who wed as teens, will shift from Fox to the WB, which probably will
pair the show with "Reba" on Fridays starting in March.</LD>
<LD>   Fox has preempted the show since September but will bring it back
for a brief run next month. Sources say the network decided it didn't
need "Grounded" long term, given that its time slot -- between "That
'70s Show" and "24" on Tuesdays -- could be filled by the second
edition of "American Idol" early next year.</LD>
<TE>   The WB will have six original episodes of the series, which made
its debut on Fox in January 2001, plus access to reruns.</TE>
<TE>   There is considerable precedent for such network-hopping --
especially to the WB and UPN. "Sister, Sister" and "The Hughleys"
each made that leap from ABC, respectively, and the WB also picked up
Fox's "The PJ's." "JAG" became a solid hit for CBS, meanwhile, after
being dropped by NBC.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The Writers Guild of America rejected a proposed change in credits
rules that opponents believed would have watered down the clout of
first writers on projects by making it easier for producers and
directors who also write to claim credit, thus collecting pay that is
tied directly to screen credit.</LD>
<LD>   Some members also felt the proposal would have enabled big-name
rewriters brought in after a lesser-known original writer turns in a
script to earn credit by simply doing minimal polishing. Credits
determine, among other things, the amount of bonuses and residuals.</LD>
<LD>   Guild members rejected the proposal, 1,238 to 946.</LD>
<TE>   This was the fourth and final item in a list of proposals that
members voted on.</TE>
<TE>   The other three put screenwriters in line with television writers
on maintaining anonymity of writers during the arbitration of credit
disputes, tightening credit rules that govern reworking source
material and basing the order of writers names in credits on the
chronological order of their participation when agreement cannot
otherwise be reached.</TE>

<HD>Booker Prize won't expand eligibility</HD>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>American writers won't have the chance to win Britain's most
prestigious literary award, according to organizers of the Booker
Prize.</LD>
<LD>   "We took the decision that the Man Booker Prize should remain as
it is because its hallmark is that it honors Commonwealth writers,"
Martyn Goff, administrator of the prize, said Monday. "That is what
the prize has built its reputation on over the last 35 years, and its
integrity is valued worldwide."</LD>
<LD>   The suggestion that organizers would expand eligibility beyond
writers from Britain, the Commonwealth of its former colonies and
Ireland first surfaced last spring, prompting furious chatter about
whether British or American fiction writing would prove stronger.</LD>

<HD>For Siteworks, context is site-specific</HD>
<DH>Experimental dancers who made the Skirball Center integral
to their work rise above the merely conventional.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Lewis Segal</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Claiming as performance sites a number of spaces inside and outside
the Skirball Cultural Center, four locally based dance companies
kicked off the experimental Siteworks series on Sunday afternoon.</LD>
<LD>   Nobody chose to dance inside the museum exhibit spaces as Liz
Lerman did in the past, and too many of the pieces looked like
conventional choreographies transferred to the Skirball.</LD>
<LD>   However, in "Wall Stories," Allyson Green and Ben Wright managed
to find potent perceptual issues in a narrow outdoor corridor and the
dry riverbed of stones behind it.</LD>
<TE>   With the audience watching from a balcony directly above them,
nine dancers used the corridor wall and floor for intriguing movement
studies, sometimes dividing the area by unrolling patches of green
carpet, sometimes linking up in web or starburst formations.</TE>
<TE>   Trip Dance Theatre soloist Craig Ng provided an improvisational
prologue to Monica Favand's "Skin Would Shed" by moving through
hillside hedgerows and around a huge sawed-off tree trunk. Then,
after he led the audience to a balcony overlooking the main
courtyard, six other Trip dancers took over, three of them posing in
body masks on the opposite sides of the balcony, three dancing below.</TE>
<TE>   The scale of the dancing proved too small to dominate the large
open space but, like many of the segments on Sunday, the performance
suggested intriguing new environmental contexts for dancing.</TE>
<TE>   It did the same for dance comedy. As the audience stood behind her
at the back of the Magnin Auditorium stage, Arianne MacBean projected
her satiric "How to Make a Site-Specific Dance" at an empty house,
illustrating her lecture in playful flurries of motion.</TE>
<TE>   The more tough-minded Shel Wagner Rasch improvised three pieces
("Middle, Up, Down") with her dance partner Stefan Fabry and cellist
Tom Peters.</TE>
<TE>   Their no-touching collaboration occurred in the lobby, their cycle
of dressing/undressing and ascending/descending on a staircase in the
Guerin Family Courtyard and their moody response to confinement
inside a freight elevator below the museum.</TE>
<TE>   Next Siteworks: Feb. 2, 2003.</TE>

<LD>"MY brother, Rolf, and I hurried to the ice pond at the park and went
directly into the warming house.</LD>

low benches and the winter smell of wet wool. A radiator near the
window hissed and sputtered. I remember it as a very cozy place.</LD>
<LD>   "Mr. Sonderquist was inside, mopping up a puddle of melted snow.
He worked there, keeping the warming house in order -- sometimes a

<TE>   "Rolf put on his hockey skates, patted me on the head and rushed
outside to his waiting friends. I was also in a hurry, but I took
care to tie my laces good and tight so my ankles wouldn't sag.</TE>
<TE>   " 'Look, Mr. Sonderquist, I have new figure skates,' I said,
proudly showing them off.</TE>

asked, 'Bundled up today?'</TE>

pairs of socks,' I answered.</TE>
<TE>   "I zipped my heavy jacket, wrapped my woolly scarf around my neck
and mouth and opened the door. A gust of icy air brushed my face, but
I grabbed hold of the railing and headed down the wooden ramp.</TE>
<TE>   "I could see Rolf and his friends swooping about, smacking a
hockey puck back and forth with their hockey sticks. Crack. Whack.
Thwack. They shouted and laughed, and their voices rang out and hung
in the still air.</TE>

<LD>Three early films by William Wyler, two Cary Grant flicks from the
1950s and a "Star Trek" adventure are among the golden oldies that
recently made their debuts on DVD.</LD>
<LD>   This year marks the 100th birthday of three-time Oscar-winning
director Wyler, and to celebrate, Kino on Video has released three
terrific films that the Austrian-born filmmaker made early in his
career: "The Love Trap," "Counsellor-at-Law" and "The Good Fairy"($30
each).</LD>
<LD>   "The Love Trap," from 1929, is part talkie-part silent and stars
Laura La Plante as a New York hoofer who, on the same day that she
loses her job, is propositioned at a wild party by a womanizer,
thrown out of her apartment and rescued off the street by a wealthy,
handsome young man (Neil Hamilton).</LD>
<TE>   The dancer and the young man fall in love and marry, but their
wedded bliss nearly comes to a screeching halt when her husband's
uncle recognizes her from the party. "The Love Trap" is a throwaway
but a lot of fun.</TE>
<TE>   Included on the disc is "Directed by William Wyler," a documentary
made by his daughter, Catherine, the trailers from 17 Wyler films and
a filmography.</TE>
<TE>   Four years after "The Love Trap," Wyler made the brisk and
sophisticated drama "Counsellor-at-Law," adapted by Elmer Rice from
his hit play. John Barrymore is riveting as a high-powered New York
attorney who finds himself in hot water when one of his political
enemies discovers a past legal indiscretion and begins disbarment
proceedings.</TE>
<TE>   Doris Kenyon plays his social-climbing wife who is having a fling
with a ne'er-do-well (Melvyn Douglas), Bebe Daniels is his supportive
secretary and Vincent Sherman, who became a well-respected film
director, plays an anarchist. The DVD also features rare photographs
of Wyler.</TE>
<TE>   Rounding out the collection is the enchanting 1935 comedy "The
Good Fairy," which boasts a lovely and funny screenplay by Preston
Sturges. Margaret Sullavan (who was briefly married to Wyler) is
perfectly cast as a Budapest orphan hired by a movie theater owner to
be an usherette at a local film palace.</TE>
<TE>   Taking the advice of the head of the orphanage (Beulah Bondi) a
bit too literally to "spread your wings," Sullavan's Luisa decides to
live the life of a fairy-tale angel and help someone in need. Herbert
Marshall and Frank Morgan play the men in her life. Included on the
disc are the trailer and personal Wyler photographs.</TE>
<TE>   Director Alfred Hitchcock found a perfect leading man in Cary
Grant. The two collaborated on some of the best tales of suspense
made in the '40s and '50s, including "Suspicion," "Notorious" and
"North by Northwest." And now Paramount has released their 1955
vehicle, "To Catch a Thief," on DVD ($27). A light, scrumptious
souffle, "To Catch a Thief" finds a charming Grant playing a former
cat burglar living on the French Riviera who is the prime suspect in
a rash of recent burglaries at the fashionable hotels. Grace Kelly,
another Hitch favorite, and Jesse Royce Landis also star.</TE>
<TE>   The DVD includes a gorgeous wide-screen transfer that looks
light-years better than the TV prints, and three new featurettes:
"Writing and Casting: The Making of 'To Catch a Thief,' " "Alfred
Hitchcock and 'To Catch a Thief' " and "Edith Head: The Paramount
Years."</TE>
<TE>   Grant is also in fine form in the underrated romantic comedy
"Houseboat" (Paramount, $25), in which he plays a widower with three
children who hires Sophia Loren -- the runaway daughter of an Italian
conductor -- to be the nanny. It was directed by Melville Shavelson.
The DVD features the wide-screen version of the film, a photo gallery
and the trailer.</TE>
<TE>   Also new from Paramount is the classy two-disc set of the 1984
sci-fi adventure "Star Trek III: The Search for Spock" ($30), which
was directed by Spock himself, Leonard Nimoy. The film isn't as good
as "Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan," but it's definitely a good
time-killer.</TE>
<TE>   The digital edition includes a wide-screen version of the film,
decent commentary from Nimoy, writer-producer Harve Bennett, director
of photography Charles Correll and actress Robin Curtis (who played
the Vulcan Lt. Saavik). It also features a very entertaining text
commentary by "Trek" experts Michael Okuda and Denise Okuda;
"Captain's Log," a new documentary that features interviews with
Nimoy, Bennett and William Shatner; "Star Trek Universe," a series of
mini-featurettes that include interviews with the Industrial Light &amp;
Magic model creators; and a look at the creation of the Klingon
language.</TE>
<TE>   "Terraforming and the Prime Directive" is an informative
documentary with NASA scientist Dr. Louis Friedman on terraforming:
changing the structure of a planet to make it habitable for humans.</TE>
<TE>   The famed British filmmaking team of Michael Powell and Emeric
Pressburger -- whose company was called the Archers -- lamented that
their 1943 film, "The Life and Death of Colonel Blimp," was cut to
shreds when it was released in the U.S.</TE>
<TE>   But for the Criterion Collection DVD ($40), the 160 minutes-plus
running time has been reinstated and the British Film Institute has
restored the exquisite Technicolor production to all its original
grandeur. And for the DVD, it's presented in a new high-definition
digital transfer.</TE>
<TE>   "Colonel Blimp," made during World War II, stars the memorable
Roger Livesey as Clive Wynn-Candy. At the beginning of the film, he's
a blustering, rotund old man -- the epitome of outmoded ideas and
values that David Low lampooned in his "Colonel Blimp" cartoons.</TE>
<TE>   But then the film travels back 40 years, and we learn about his
life, his loves -- Deborah Kerr plays all three women in his life --
and his friendship with a German officer (the splendid Anton
Wolbrook). The DVD includes a documentary on the making of the film,
behind-the-scenes and production stills, a collection of Low's
original "Colonel Blimp" cartoons and crackerjack commentary taped in
1988 with director Martin Scorsese and Powell. John Ford received his
fourth and final best director Oscar for his rollicking, magical 1952
romantic comedy "The Quiet Man," which Artisan has just released on
DVD in a special collector's edition ($20). John Wayne, in one of his
greatest roles, plays an American boxer who returns to the Irish
hometown of his mother and falls in love with the beautiful redheaded
colleen (Maureen O'Hara) who lives next door. Victor McLaglen
received a best supporting actor nomination for his role as O'Hara's
hotheaded brother, who is against her marriage to Wayne.</TE>
<TE>   The cast is filled with members of John Ford's stock company of
players, including Ward Bond, Mildred Natwick and Barry Fitzgerald.
Winton C. Hoch received an Oscar for his glorious Technicolor
cinematography.</TE>
<TE>   The DVD features a documentary on the making of the movie, hosted
by Leonard Maltin, and a "Remembering 'The Quiet Man' " montage of
scenes.</TE>

<HD>Fascinating turkey tidbits to gobble up</HD>

<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>If you're the programmer at the Animal Planet channel and the
calendar rolls around to November, it can only mean one thing: It's
time to trot out the annual turkey special.</LD>
<LD>   But since most people's interest in this most feast-worthy of fowl
doesn't go much beyond the "light meat or dark" question, getting
folks to sit still for an hourlong program promising to "uncover the
mysteries of America's favorite holiday bird" would seem a tough
sell.</LD>
<LD>   Yet "Turkey Secrets," tonight's bill of fare airing at 8, manages
to provide a diverting and, dare one say, even entertaining hour by
exploring our fine feathered friend from just about every conceivable
angle.</LD>
<TE>   Now, this being Animal Planet and not the Food Channel, references
to the fate of millions of these turkeys each Thanksgiving are
fleeting. The focus is squarely on the bird's quirky lifestyle in the
wild as well as the amazing preservation efforts that saved the
turkey from nearly being hunted out of existence in the U.S. by the
1920s.</TE>
<TE>   After watching the show, you may hesitate a bit ruefully, if only
for a moment or two, before revving up the carving knife at next
Thursday's dinner table.</TE>
<TE>   You'll learn facts (Abe Lincoln made Thanksgiving a national
holiday in 1863), unlearn urban myths (turkeys are not stupid and
will not drown if left out in the rain), and witness firsthand the
terror experienced by a mailman who was chased off his route for two
weeks by a turf-protecting tom.</TE>
<TE>   And just in case you're looking for a rather exotic indoor pet to
make you the envy of the neighborhood, you'll get instructions on how
to diaper a turkey from the proud owner of Mr. Puff.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps Ben Franklin, who lobbied for the indigenous turkey over
the bald eagle as America's symbol of freedom, was backing the right
candidate after all.</TE>

<HD>A dazzling performance by fledgling musicians</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Josef Woodard</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Is it just an illusion, or are our fledgling classical musicians
getting better at a younger age? That was the impression left by the
Debut Orchestra's concert Sunday afternoon at the Wilshire Ebell
Theatre, part of the 48th season of the Young Musicians Foundation.</LD>
<LD>   Front and center were dazzling violinist Yumi Man -- all of 15 --
admirably tackling the Mendelssohn Violin Concerto, and a sure-handed
and confident conductor, Joana Carneiro, a relative veteran at 26, in
her first regular-season performance with the training orchestra
since being named its conductor for the next three years.</LD>
<LD>   A generally refined orchestral sound triggered a particular
double-take sensation; it's difficult to reconcile the sight of such
young musicians onstage (ages 14 to 25) and an orchestral sound so
maturely articulated -- a happy cognitive dissonance.</LD>
<TE>   Man qualifies as a violinist to watch. On the Mendelssohn, she
showed an assured voice, whose tonal poise and technical aplomb were
evident from the opening melodic statement through the first
movement's luminous cadenza to the finale's fervent obstacle course.</TE>
<TE>   Sunday's program was varied enough to show off the ensemble's
range and Carneiro's flexibility and control. She moved the players
with ease from the pert gentility of Mozart's Symphony No. 32 in G,
K. 318, to the intriguing incidental theater music of Gabriel Faure's
"Pelleas et Melisande" Suite, Opus 80 and, finally, Zoltan Kodaly's
spicy "Galanta Dances."</TE>
<TE>   The Debut Orchestra's concert offered good music-making by any
standard, and also reassurance. Whatever the fate of the classical
music infrastructure, the coming generation of players is ready, able
and artful.</TE>

<HD>Agilent Sales Beat Forecasts; Company to Cut 2,500 Jobs</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL>PALO ALTO</DL>
<LD>Agilent Technologies Inc. shares rose during extended trading hours
after the maker of testing and measurement equipment said Monday that
sales topped forecasts and that it would eliminate 2,500 jobs.</LD>
<LD>   The company reported a fourth-quarter loss partly because of
severance costs.</LD>
<LD>   The net loss was $236 million, or 51 cents a share, in the quarter
ended Oct. 31, compared with net income of $197 million, or 43 cents,
a year earlier, Agilent said.</LD>
<TE>   Sales rose 8.1%, the first year-over-year increase in six
quarters, to $1.74 billion from $1.61 billion.</TE>
<TE>   Palo Alto-based Agilent has been paring expenses over the last
year as sales tumbled as a result of slack demand for gear used to
test telecommunications equipment.</TE>
<TE>   The company, which was spun off from Hewlett-Packard Co. in 2000,
is trimming 2,500 positions in addition to the 8,000 announced last
year, spokeswoman Michele Drake said.</TE>
<TE>   Agilent said in August that it planned to eliminate more jobs to
save $50 million per quarter.</TE>
<TE>   Shares of Agilent, which have fallen 52% this year, rose 8.5% to
$14.75 in extended trading Monday.</TE>
<TE>   The shares fell 20 cents to $13.60 on the New York Stock Exchange
before the announcement.</TE>

<HD>CalPERS Targets Offshore Companies</HD>
<DH>The pension fund will sponsor resolutions asking three
firms to return to the U.S.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Gary Gentile</AU>
<BD>Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The investment committee of the huge California Public Employees'
Retirement System voted Monday to sponsor shareholder resolutions
asking three major offshore companies to return to the United States.</LD>
<LD>   CalPERS, the nation's largest public pension fund, agreed to
co-sponsor resolutions with the American Federation of State, County
and Municipal Employees to seek to change the formal addresses of
Tyco International Ltd., Ingersoll-Rand Co. and McDermott
International Inc.</LD>
<LD>   About 20 public companies are incorporated offshore in large part
to avoid paying U.S. income taxes and also because shareholders in
other countries have more limited rights.</LD>
<TE>   Tyco International and Ingersoll-Rand are based in Bermuda.
McDermott International is based in Panama.</TE>
<TE>   The shareholder votes, which are scheduled to take place at the
companies' annual meetings early next year, would not be binding.</TE>
<TE>   State Treasurer Phil Angelides, a member of the CalPERS investment
committee, called offshore incorporation "a despicable practice."</TE>
<TE>   "It says, 'We're not going to fulfill our corporate responsibility
to pay taxes and we're going to make it hard for shareholders to
enforce their rights,' " he said.</TE>
<TE>   Angelides said it was especially important for public retirement
funds to take a strong stand against the practice in light of a void
in leadership at the Securities and Exchange Commission.</TE>
<TE>   The employees' federation also is recruiting public retirement
funds in Connecticut and other states to join in the effort.
Angelides said he also would bring the matter before the state
teachers' retirement fund.</TE>
<TE>   State Controller Kathleen Connell abstained from the vote because
she is a regular commentator on the CNBC financial program "Squawk
Box," which regularly discusses issues involving the three companies.</TE>
<TE>   The vote by CalPERS' investment committee was sufficient to take
action and does not require a vote by the full CalPERS board.</TE>
<TE>   CalPERS has assets of $136 billion and provides retirement and
health benefits to 1.3 million municipal employees and their
families.</TE>

<HD>Survey Finds Women Holding More 'Corporate Clout' Titles</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Rebecca Gomez</AU>
<BD>Associated Press</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Despite all the recent shocks to corporate America and the faltering
economy, women continued to make inroads into the upper ranks at
Fortune 500 companies, a survey being released today said.</LD>
<LD>   The number of female corporate officers at Fortune 500 companies
increased 3.2 percentage points over the last two years, according to
the biannual survey by Catalyst, a New York-based women's advocacy
group.</LD>
<LD>   "Historically, in down economies, women tend to be hit very hard.
We have data showing that this has not happened, which is a surprise
for many," Catalyst President Sheila Wellington said. "When times are
bad, to maintain a competitive position, you've got to keep top
talent, and there's a recognition that women are in that top talent
pool."</LD>
<TE>   Women make up 15.7% of the top-ranking executives at America's
largest companies -- or 2,140 of the 13,673 total -- compared with
12.5% in 2000 and 8.7% in 1995 when the group began keeping track.</TE>
<TE>   Women held 7.9%, or 191, of the 2,412 "corporate clout titles,"
which Catalyst defined as chief executive, chairman, vice chairman,
president, chief operating officer, senior executive vice president
and executive vice president. That's an increase from the 6.2% in
1997.</TE>
<TE>   The number of female chief executives increased to six, comprising
1.2% of the Fortune 500 CEO population. Two years ago, there were
just two female CEOs.</TE>
<TE>   Catalyst used company-provided data and regulatory filings for its
study.</TE>

<HD>Preschool's Link to Weill Probed</HD>
<DH>Investigation centers on whether Citigroup CEO used his
influence to help analyst's twin sons.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Thomas S. Mulligan</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>State investigators probing Wall Street conflicts of interest have
turned their attention to an alleged nursery-school quid pro quo
involving Citigroup Inc. Chief Executive Sanford I. Weill and his
former top telecommunications analyst, according to a person close to
the investigation.</LD>
<LD>   The thrust of the inquiry by the New York attorney general's
office, this person said, is to determine whether Weill used his
influence -- and a $1-million Citigroup donation-- to help get the
analyst's twin sons into an exclusive Manhattan preschool, partly in
exchange for the analyst's upgrading his investment opinion on AT&amp;T
Corp., a major Citigroup client.</LD>
<LD>   The analyst, Jack Grubman of Citigroup's Salomon Smith Barney
unit, had long held a negative view of AT&amp;T. He boosted his rating on
the phone giant's stock to a "strong buy" from a "hold" in November
1999. Shortly afterward, Citigroup won a role in the public stock
offering of AT&amp;T's wireless unit.</LD>
<TE>   In an e-mail message sent by Grubman and later examined by
investigators, the analyst bragged to a money manager that he
upgraded AT&amp;T so Weill would help get Grubman's sons into the
preschool program at the 92nd Street Y, one of the most desirable
schools on Manhattan's Upper East Side.</TE>
<TE>   Weill sought the upgrade, according to Grubman's e-mail, because
he wanted to enlist the aid of C. Michael Armstrong, AT&amp;T's chairman
and a Citigroup director, in ousting Weill's rival, former Citigroup
co-Chairman John Reed.</TE>
<TE>   Under pressure from investigations by New York Atty. Gen. Eliot
Spitzer and congressional committees, Grubman resigned in August.</TE>
<TE>   Weill, in a memo to employees released by Citigroup last week,
acknowledged asking Grubman to "take a fresh look at AT&amp;T in light of
the dramatic transformation of the company." But he denied an
exchange of favors and said he expected the analyst to "reach
independent conclusions that were entirely his own."</TE>
<TE>   Weill also acknowledged helping Grubman with the 92nd Street Y,
but said he did so only "because he was an important employee who had
asked for my help." He said the donation to the Y was "consistent
with Citigroup's philanthropic efforts."</TE>
<TE>   Last week, Grubman backed away from the motivations described in
his e-mail, saying: "Regrettably, I invented a story in an effort to
inflate my professional importance."</TE>

<HD>Diageo in Talks to Save Burger King Sale</HD>
<DH>Consortium of buyers is seeking better terms, but both
sides still are committed to the deal, firm says.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Diageo, the world's largest liquor company, tried Monday to salvage
its sale of Burger King Corp. after the U.S. investors who had agreed
to the deal insisted on more attractive terms.</LD>
<LD>   Talks continued with the investor consortium -- comprising Texas
Pacific Group, Bain Capital Inc. and Goldman Sachs Capital Partners
-- and both sides still were committed to the deal, London-based
Diageo said.</LD>
<LD>   Diageo wants to unload Burger King so it can concentrate on its
drinks business, which includes Johnnie Walker scotch and Smirnoff
vodka.</LD>
<TE>   The investor group had agreed in July to buy Miami-based Burger
King for $2.26 billion. Burger King has more than 11,400 restaurants
worldwide and is the No. 2 fast-food chain, after McDonald's Corp.</TE>
<TE>   The consortium asked last week for changes to its agreement with
Diageo given the weakened conditions in Burger King's markets and
their potential effect on the buyers' ability to obtain financing.</TE>
<TE>   In the latest development, the buyers' group said it could not do
the deal as agreed. However, it expressed a desire to continue talks
toward "a transaction materially different as to terms and
structure," Diageo said.</TE>
<TE>   The company said it still hoped to complete the sale by year's end
but was considering other options.</TE>

<HD>DVD Sales Trend More Than Hollywood Hype</HD>
<DH>Studios put big bucks into disc releases, which rival
theater sales</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>James Bates</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The 250 guests in their black-and-white finest will be ushered down a
red carpet to a chilly screening room where popcorn buckets await
them.</LD>
<LD>   Yet the waddling-room-only crowd of penguins will be snacking on
anchovies. The stunt Thursday at Sea World in Orlando, Fla., is aimed
at commemorating the DVD release later this month of 20th Century
Fox's hit animated film "Ice Age."</LD>
<LD>   The real purpose: Film at 11.</LD>
<TE>   "What TV station wouldn't want to run that?" said Fox Home
Entertainment President Pat Wyatt.</TE>
<TE>   For consumers, DVD is beginning to seem as if it stands for deja
vu-ed. With the biggest block ever of summer movies being released
this quarter on disc, and with 45 million DVD players now in homes,
studios can mint more money from a film's DVD release than they do
from the box office.</TE>
<TE>   As a result, many of the same marketing and distribution
strategies and gimmicks used to "open" a film are being recycled to
"open" a DVD.</TE>
<TE>   Tuesdays have become the weekly D-day for home entertainment
executives and their DVD releases, much like Friday is for their
studio counterparts who release films into theaters. Executives
nervously await results like politicians scanning early election
returns so they can proclaim victory. Called the "street date,"
Tuesday gives retailers time to prepare for the weekend rush.</TE>
<TE>   Today, it's "Spirit: Stallion of the Cimarron." Last week saw
"Star Wars: Episode II -- Attack of the Clones." Next week comes "Men
in Black II."</TE>
<TE>   Among the movies being jammed into stores this quarter are
"Scooby-Doo," "The Scorpion King," "Spider-Man," "Austin Powers in
Goldmember" and "Lilo &amp; Stitch."</TE>
<TE>   Some are revamped versions of previously released DVDs. A
"platinum edition" of "Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the
Ring," released last week, includes 30 additional minutes that aren't
in last year's film or the DVD version released three months ago.</TE>
<TE>   The proliferation of releases among fierce competitors has caused
ad budgets to swell at times to well above $20 million, two to four
times what a studio once might have spent to advertise a movie on
videocassette.</TE>
<TE>   Just as they flood theaters with thousands of film prints, studios
now jam the aisles of Wal-Mart, Best Buy, Blockbuster and other
stores with as many as 25 million copies of big hit films on disc.
And just as they boast about setting box-office records, studios
splice and dice DVD sales numbers in the first day or two to claim
bragging rights.</TE>
<TE>   "It's important to push through as many sales as possible at
stores so they can make room for the next new releases," said Ben
Feingold, chief of Sony Pictures' Columbia TriStar Home Video unit,
which just released "Spider-Man" and soon will follow with "Men in
Black II."</TE>
<TE>   Driving the trend is more than the usual Hollywood hype. The DVD
explosion is so profitable it has become one of the few bright spots
for the media industry, which has seen profits and stock prices
languish.</TE>
<TE>   DVDs now are being shipped by studios at about twice last year's
pace. The 425.6 million shipped through September in North America
eclipsed last year's total of 364.4 million. With DVDs the driving
force, overall domestic home video revenue is expected to climb to
$23 billion next year, according to Salomon Smith Barney projections.
That's nearly three times the projected box-office total and up 23%
from last year.</TE>
<TE>   Discs have some distinct economic advantages. DVDs are cheaper to
make than videocassettes, with manufacturing costs of about $1.10
compared with about $1.75 for VHS versions. Overall profit can be
about $12.50 a DVD, compared with about $9.25 for a VHS tape.</TE>
<TE>   "DVD is the largest source of additional revenue and profit ever
created in entertainment in such a short period of time," said Warner
Bros. home video chief Warren Lieberfarb, widely regarded as the
godfather of the genre. "It's driving the growth in the movie
industry."</TE>
<TE>   Unfortunately, some executives say, the emphasis on early sales
results comes at the expense of a disc's long-term sales potential.
One week, a DVD can be on display in a store's prime location, such
as near the checkout aisle or in a stand-alone display. But when the
next big release comes along, the title could end up in "the dead
zone" or "in line," nicknames for the rows of bins in which all the
other DVDs are stacked.</TE>
<TE>   "When you evaluate DVDs like a feature film, with the first week
of sales compared to the instant box-office numbers, it sends the
wrong message about our product," said Matt Lasorsa, senior vice
president and head of marketing with New Line Home Entertainment. "A
film will be in theaters four or five weeks. We're going to be on
shelves for years."</TE>
<TE>   Still, studios are doing whatever it takes to highlight their DVD
sales to downplay the problems in such other important divisions as
movies, television, Internet and theme parks. Film companies such as
MGM Inc. sell themselves to investors on the strength of the
thousands of potential DVDs in their film vaults.</TE>
<TE>   Walt Disney Co.'s earnings this month showed operating income
falling at three of its four divisions.</TE>
<TE>   The lone standout was its movie studio, thanks largely to DVD
sales of "Monsters, Inc.," "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs" and a
"Cinderella" sequel, all of which helped offset a drop in Disney's
worldwide theatrical business.</TE>
<TE>   Sony Pictures' "Spider-Man" DVD rang up more than $190 million in
sales in its first weekend, compared with its opening weekend
box-office record of nearly $115 million. The vast majority of that
$190 million -- possibly as much as $160 million, rivals estimate --
finds its way to the studio.</TE>
<TE>   That's because many retailers sell hot DVDs for almost no profit,
or even at a loss. Nonetheless, retailers say the rotten margins are
worth it because a DVD release has become one of the most effective
ways to lure people into their stores to buy other things.</TE>
<TE>   "There's no doubt that for us it drives both our rental and retail
traffic," said Nick Sheperd, executive vice president and chief
concept officer for video giant Blockbuster Inc.</TE>
<TE>   Video divisions are increasingly borrowing from the playbook of
the movie side by using showmanship to get people's attention. Among
the schemes: the penguin screening; cancan dancers on Hollywood
Boulevard to mark the release of "Moulin Rouge"; commemorative
bookends for the special edition of "Lord of the Rings: The
Fellowship of the Ring"; and a fiery reenactment on Sunset Boulevard
of a scene from "The Scorpion King."</TE>
<TE>   They also are reaching to claim new records.</TE>
<TE>   On Nov. 3, for instance, Sony Pictures announced that it had
shattered records by selling 7 million "Spider-Man" DVDs and
videocassettes on the first day. Eleven days later, Fox proclaimed
that in the "first 24 hours" of release consumers made "Star Wars:
Episode II -- Attack of the Clones" "the fastest-selling home
entertainment release of the year."</TE>
<TE>   In many cases, it all depends on how one defines the record. Some
studios count DVDs shipped to retailers but not necessarily sold.
Others pump up results by including advance orders.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, with the number of DVD players in homes growing
exponentially, it's only natural that records keep falling. "We have
a growing market," said Kelley Avery, head of home entertainment
worldwide for DreamWorks. "That's why we're seeing the increasing
numbers."</TE>

<HD>Some Web Sites Are Posting a 'Keep Out' Sign to Law
Enforcement</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jon Healey</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Hundreds of Web sites offering pirated movies, games and other
goodies have adopted a curious line of defense: a start-up page that
tells law enforcement agents they're not allowed to look inside.</LD>
<LD>   With a few words changed here or there, the same "disclaimer" is
popping up on Internet sites hawking items ranging from replicas of
designer sunglasses to instructions for stealing satellite TV
signals. It orders all police, government agents and anti-piracy
officials to leave the site immediately -- and no peeking on the way
out!</LD>
<LD>   "If you enter this site you are violating code 431.322.12 of the
Internet Privacy Act signed by Bill Clinton in 1995 and that means
that you cannot threaten our [Internet providers] or any person(s) or
company storing these files," a typical disclaimer warns. It also
admonishes visitors that they "cannot prosecute any person(s)
affiliated with this page which includes family, friends or
individuals who run or enter this Web site."</LD>
<TE>   Though the confusing verbiage smacks of legalese, the disclaimer
is legally meaningless. There is no "Internet Privacy Act."</TE>
<TE>   If there were, Bruce Lehman surely would know about it. He led the
Clinton administration's efforts to update patent and copyright law
for the Internet age and now is president of the International
Intellectual Property Institute in Washington. Federal protections
apply mainly to personal records that might be stored online, such as
medical charts, Lehman said.</TE>
<TE>   "That is where you have a right to privacy," he said, "not when
you post something on the Web and are basically throwing your persona
into the public domain."</TE>
<TE>   The authors of the disclaimer appear to have gotten their legal
education from "Law &amp; Order" or "NYPD Blue," said Marc Rotenberg,
executive director of the Electronic Privacy Information Center in
Washington. Investigators "do have the right to operate in an
undercover capacity, and many do online," he noted. "That disclaimer
is definitely not a get-out-of-jail card."</TE>
<TE>   Nevertheless, the warning can be found on Web sites around the
globe, appearing in German, Italian, Chinese and Czech, among other
languages. The sites typically are devoted to illicit purposes, such
as hawking pirated wares or offering hacking tips. But the disclaimer
also can be found on such innocuous efforts as a Spanish chess
database and a Portuguese site dedicated to bowling alleys.</TE>
<TE>   The warning's origin is unclear. Howard Canten of Conway, Ark.,
who operates a site selling DVDs before their official release,
offered a typical explanation.</TE>
<TE>   "We got the information from another DVD distributor," Canten
said, naming a site based in Sweden. The disclaimer "protects us so
we can't be threatened or sued or whatever."</TE>
<TE>   Lehman said he wasn't surprised that the same wording was posted
on so many sites offering goods of dubious legality.</TE>
<TE>   "Since they're all pirates," he said, "they all copy it."</TE>

<HD>American Cuts Some Business Air Fares</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>American Airlines has taken a tiny step toward placating corporate
travelers fed up with the huge disparity between business fares and
leisure fares.</LD>
<LD>   American, the world's largest airline, launched a simplified fare
structure in a small number of markets last week, lowering the price
of tickets bought at the last minute by as much as 40%. The apparent
goal is to steer business travelers away from cheaper
advance-purchase fares that have become popular during the economic
downturn.</LD>
<LD>   It's all part of an effort to compress the wide range of air
fares, which many corporate travel managers say is at the root of
business travelers' frugality this last year. In many cases the
cheapest business fare is five times more expensive than the
least-expensive leisure fare.</LD>
<TE>   Many business travelers now purchase tickets far in advance and
search the Internet for the best deals -- strategies typically
associated with leisure travelers.</TE>
<TE>   Under the changes made by American, the lowest one-way, walk-up
fare between Dallas and Los Angeles is now $647, down from $1,078.
Between New Orleans and Seattle, the lowest one-way, walk-up fare is
now $604, down from $907.</TE>
<TE>   "They're going to be surprised by how many business travelers are
going to take them up on it," said Terry Trippler, a Minneapolis
travel consultant.</TE>
<TE>   Leisure travelers aren't so lucky, though. They will face tighter
restrictions on the least-expensive fares, including requirements to
purchase such tickets 30 days in advance instead of 14 days.</TE>
<TE>   The fare structure being tested by American is extremely limited.
It will affect passengers on just 23 routes, less than 1% of the
carrier's total schedule, which has some 12,500 city pairs. However,
analysts say it could mark the beginning of something larger if
American succeeds in attracting more higher-paying business
customers.</TE>
<TE>   Shares of American's parent, AMR Inc., rose 34 cents Monday to
close at $7.15 on the New York Stock Exchange.</TE>

<HD>Toyota Leases Fuel-Cell Autos to 2 UC Campuses</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Alan Ohnsman</AU>
<BD>Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Toyota Motor Corp. said Monday that two California universities are
its first U.S. customers for hydrogen fuel-cell autos as the company
seeks to establish its low-pollution technology as an industry
standard.</LD>
<LD>   The automaker will lease one modified version of the Highlander
sport utility model to UC Irvine and another to UC Davis. The schools
will each pay $10,000 a month on a 30-month lease.</LD>
<LD>   Toyota and rival automakers are racing to offer fuel-cell
technology in anticipation of tighter environmental rules.</LD>
<TE>   Fuel cells, used in spacecraft for decades, create electricity by
combining hydrogen and oxygen, and under ideal conditions produce
only steam as a byproduct. High costs and a lack of hydrogen-fueling
stations limit current prospects for the technology.</TE>
<TE>   "Bringing practical fuel-cell-powered vehicles to the mass market
will require a considerable investment of time, resources,
cooperation and patience," Jim Press, executive vice president and
chief operating officer of Toyota's U.S. sales unit, said in a
statement. "This program marks a significant first step."</TE>
<TE>   Last month Honda Motor Co. announced plans to lease five fuel-cell
cars to Los Angeles, with one to be delivered this year and four in
2003. The company hasn't disclosed when the first vehicle is to be
delivered to the city or the lease terms.</TE>
<TE>   General Motors Corp., the world's largest automaker, also is
investing in the technology and has said it expects to be first to
sell 100,000 annually as early as 2010.</TE>
<TE>   Toyota is providing the universities with an FCHV, or fuel-cell
hybrid vehicle, model that uses an electric motor as a backup.</TE>
<TE>   The FCHV has a Toyota-developed fuel cell stack, seats five and
has a top speed of more than 90 mph. The company said Monday that it
also would lease four FCHVs to Japanese government agencies starting
Dec. 2.</TE>
<TE>   Toyota's U.S. sales unit is based in Torrance. The company's
shares fell $1.39 to $51.85 on the New York Stock Exchange.</TE>

<HD>Little Growth Seen in Germany's Economy</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL>FRANKFURT</DL>
<LD>Germany's economy, Europe's largest, barely grew in the third
quarter, data reported Monday show. And experts said there's little
sign of improvement so far this quarter.</LD>
<LD>   That could force the European Central Bank to cut interest rates
soon, some analysts said. The bank has been balking at making further
cuts because of inflation worries in countries including Spain and
Ireland.</LD>
<LD>   German gross domestic product rose 0.3% in the third quarter from
the previous three-month period, the same rate as in the preceding
two quarters, according to the Bundesbank, Germany's central bank.</LD>
<TE>   Germany accounts for about a third of the economy of the dozen
nations sharing the euro currency.</TE>
<TE>   The stagnation of the German economy has contributed to the dismal
performance of German stocks this year. The DAX index of blue-chip
shares is down 37.6% in euro terms since Jan. 1, far worse than the
21.6% drop in the U.S. Standard &amp; Poor's index.</TE>
<TE>   German business confidence dropped for a fifth straight month and
unemployment rose to the highest level in almost four years in
October.</TE>
<TE>   The nation's economy will grow 0.2% this year and 1% next year, a
panel of advisors to the government known as the "Five Wise Men" said
in their annual assessment of the economy.</TE>
<TE>   "What's missing the most is the hope for an improvement, which has
always been a prerequisite for stronger investments and employment,"
the Bundesbank said in a report.</TE>
<TE>   Stagnating German growth is putting pressure on the European
Central Bank to follow the lead of the U.S. Federal Reserve and lower
interest rates further.</TE>
<TE>   "The weakening outlook for growth this year and next leads us to
expect that inflation rates will come down, and the ECB council will
have to take that into consideration," Ernst Welteke, an ECB
policymaker, said.</TE>
<TE>   The European Central Bank's benchmark short-term interest rate is
at 3.25%. By contrast, the U.S. Fed's rate is 1.25%, a 40-year low.
The Fed cut its rate from 1.75% on Nov. 6.</TE>
<TE>   Germany is crimping growth among its neighbors. The Bank of France
predicts gross domestic product in the euro region's No. 2 economy
expanded just 0.4% in the third quarter.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. economy expanded at a 3.1% annual rate in the third
quarter, though growth is expected to slow this quarter.</TE>

<HD>Global Foresees Few Problems Over Filing</HD>
<DH>Asian unit's Chapter 11 move comes as parent firm deals
with its own bankruptcy case.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>James S. Granelli</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Global Crossing Ltd. said Monday that the Bankruptcy Court filing of
its majority-owned subsidiary, Asia Global Crossing Ltd., will have
"no material impact" on its cash position, operations or ability to
emerge from its own Chapter 11 proceedings as a healthy
telecommunications services provider.</LD>
<LD>   Global Crossing said it still expects to win government approval
for a plan to sell control of the subsidiary to two Asian companies
and to emerge from bankruptcy proceedings by the end of April with
its major network -- which serves North America and Europe -- intact.
"We don't anticipate that this [Asia Global] filing will have any
effect on Global Crossing's emergence from Chapter 11," said company
spokeswoman Tisha Kresler.</LD>
<LD>   Asia Global filed a bankruptcy petition late Sunday as part of a
plan to sell itself to a new company formed by China Netcom
Communications Group Corp., which is owned by the Chinese government.
That wiped out Global Crossing's 59% stake in Asia Global.</LD>
<TE>   Asia Global long had been considered a key asset in completing the
overall Global Crossing network, which was dreamed up by Los Angeles
financier Gary Winnick. But the unit lagged in building its network
connecting eight Asian countries and became a drain on the parent
company. It provided only 6% of Global Crossing's total revenue in
September, but accounted for 22% of the total loss.</TE>
<TE>   With Sunday's filing, the parent also lost any chance to recoup
$252 million in available cash that the unit had at the end of
September. That represented 45% of Global Crossing's reported cash on
hand.</TE>
<TE>   Kresler said Global Crossing had not been counting on Asia
Global's cash to help pay its own bills. At the end of September, the
parent company had $305 million in cash plus $326 million in
restricted cash, earmarked for paying creditors. Global Crossing went
through $57 million that month, but Asia Global Crossing accounted
for more than 40% of it.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts said Global Crossing's main business in North America and
Europe will leave plenty of opportunity for prospective new owners
Hutchison Whampoa Ltd. in Hong Kong and Singapore Technologies
Telemedia, who hope to buy Global Crossing out of bankruptcy. The
company has had no trouble buying capacity on transpacific and Asian
lines and should be able to continue serving customers in the region.</TE>
<TE>   The scale of Global Crossing's original business plan, analysts
added, was far too grand and needed to be broken up into independent,
manageable pieces. What's more, capacity swaps and other inside
transactions between parent and subsidiary "were not commercial in
nature," said Berge Ayvazian, vice chairman of the Yankee Group
research firm in Boston.</TE>
<TE>   Separately owned companies working together will provide a better
business framework for developing a worldwide network, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Max Smetannikov, an analyst at Current Analysis in Sterling, Va.,
figures that once Hutchison Whampoa and Singapore Technologies win
approved from U.S. officials to buy bankrupt Global Crossing, they
will be able to work closely with Asia Netcom.</TE>
<TE>   Hong Kong billionaire Li Ka-shing, who controls Hutchison, is on
close terms with China's political leaders and can work easily with
Asia Netcom for access to some 200 cities in eight Asian countries.</TE>

<HD>Hollywood Union Reaches Early Deal</HD>
<DH>Production workers and studios have a labor agreement
months before contract expires.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>James Bates</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It's a wrap for the union representing the workers who toil behind
Hollywood's cameras, as it reached a new labor agreement a full eight
months before the current one expires.</LD>
<LD>   The agreement between studios and the International Alliance of
Theatrical Stage Employes, reached Saturday and unveiled Monday,
affects about 30,000 workers largely in Los Angeles. It stands in
sharp contrast to last year's tense, down-to-the-wire studio talks
involving writers and actors.</LD>
<LD>   Uncertainty over whether those two groups would strike last year
was a major contributor to a yearlong industry slowdown that only
recently ebbed. Studios stockpiled projects as insurance against a
potential strike, then mothballed productions until they worked off
surpluses.</LD>
<TE>   "This is a lot better than the last-minute negotiations that can
end in a 'de facto' strike," said Alan Brunswick, an entertainment
labor lawyer with Manatt, Phelps &amp; Phillips.</TE>
<TE>   The new three-year deal affects several jobs including
cinematographers, costume designers, set designers, art directors,
production designers, grips and lighting technicians. IATSE is the
umbrella union representing locals for those workers. Its current
contract with studios expires July 31, 2003.</TE>
<TE>   Neither side would release specifics before members receive notice
in about one month.</TE>
<TE>   But both sides said workers gained additional pension and medical
contributions, a key issue amid rising health-care costs and declines
in retirement nest eggs caused by stock losses.</TE>
<TE>   IATSE President Thomas Short said members were especially
concerned about those two areas, adding that "we believe we have
reached an agreement which will secure their future."</TE>
<TE>   J. Nicholas Counter, president of the Alliance of Motion Picture
and Television Producers, the labor-negotiating arm of major
Hollywood studios and producers, said the new deal also includes
additional, unspecified labor sweeteners for producers who choose to
shoot in Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Those incentives are aimed at helping stem runaway production from
Los Angeles to cheaper locales such as Canada and Australia.</TE>
<TE>   The accord was no surprise given that Short is an outspoken
advocate of early agreements with studios and was critical of the
negotiating tactics of actors and writers last year.</TE>
<TE>   IATSE and producers negotiated their previous four contracts well
in advance, reaching back to the 1980s. IATSE argues that studios are
more probable to make concessions to avoid uncertainty that a
possible strike brings, and that the uncertainty can hurt workers by
causing producers to store projects until labor issues are resolved.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a signal to the production community that Los Angeles is
in business for movies and TV," Counter said.</TE>

<HD>IBM Wins Federal Contract</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Joseph Menn</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>IBM Corp. beat two other bidders for a contract to deliver a
supercomputer to the federal government that will be three times as
powerful as the fastest in the world today, company officials said
Monday.</LD>
<LD>   The computer will harness 12,000 of IBM's new Power5
microprocessors and will be used by Lawrence Livermore National
Laboratory in Livermore, Calif., to simulate the performance of
nuclear weapons. Dubbed ASCI Purple, it will be capable of 100
trillion calculations per second when it comes on line in the second
half of 2004.</LD>
<LD>   A second IBM supercomputer, Blue Gene/L, will be used for broader
scientific research under the same $290-million Department of Energy
contract, which will be announced today during a supercomputing
conference in Baltimore. Several national laboratories will apply
Blue Gene to problems in genetics and weather mapping.</LD>
<TE>   IBM won two earlier rounds of the Advanced Simulation and
Computing Initiative, delivering ASCI White in August 2001 and ASCI
Blue Pacific in 1998. Intel Corp. and Silicon Graphics Inc. also have
won contracts for ASCI supercomputers. The latest win came against
Hewlett-Packard Co. and an unidentified contender, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   Though ASCI Purple would fill two basketball courts, it just ties
the processing power of a single human brain, IBM said. ASCI White
had the power of a mouse brain.</TE>
<TE>   ASCI Purple will be eight times as powerful as IBM's previous ASCI
machine, said IBM chief project architect Ravi Arimilli.</TE>
<TE>   The leap was made possible through improvements in the speed of
the individual processors, he said. The clusters of servers also are
designed to move work around for peak performance.</TE>
<TE>   The result will be the first system that can track the ripple
effects of a change in the design of a nuclear weapon, Livermore
spokesman David Schwoegler said.</TE>
<TE>   "When we come up with an element in the weapon, say a change in
plutonium, we can insert it into the equation and see if it is still
viable," Schwoegler said. One cycle of the test, simulating a
fraction of a second, still will take eight weeks. On the Cray One
supercomputer used in 1994, it would have taken 60,000 years.</TE>
<TE>   The win comes at a good time for Big Blue. In a list of the 500
most powerful machines released this week, IBM didn't make the top
three for the first time in more than three years.</TE>
<TE>   In the past, IBM's work on supercomputers has trickled down and
improved machines more affordable by businesses. This time, Arimilli
said, companies will see the benefits even before the government
does.</TE>
<TE>   "With ASCI Blue and White, when you look deeply, they are designed
for number crunching, not Web serving and functions like that," he
said. "ASCI Purple is designed to go after not just deep computing
but Web serving and things affecting 99% of the server industry." The
same chips and system architecture will be sold in small IBM
computers early in 2004, he said.</TE>

<HD>Ice Cream Makers Put Containers on a Diet</HD>
<DH>Three of the largest firms shrink tub sizes -- but not the
price -- as ingredient costs rise.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Melinda Fulmer</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Ice cream makers have found an easy way to sweeten the bottom line:
Shrink the package.</LD>
<LD>   The ubiquitous half-gallon is quietly giving way to smaller tubs
as ice cream companies look for ways to hold on to profits as
ingredient prices rise.</LD>
<LD>   Three of the nation's largest ice cream makers have put their
containers on a diet and are selling 1.75 quarts, rather than the
half-gallon "brick," which has been the standard for decades and
constitutes three-quarters of all ice cream sold. Other companies
could follow suit.</LD>
<TE>   Oakland-based Dreyer's Grand Ice Cream Inc., the nation's largest
ice cream maker, switched to a smaller tub in March, more than a year
after rival Unilever began selling its Breyers Ice Cream Parlor line
in 1.75-quart receptacles. The new containers look the same and cost
the same but weigh slightly less than the previous two-quart tubs.</TE>
<TE>   The size adjustment was triggered by a $30-million run-up last
year in the cost of butterfat and other ingredients, Dreyer's says.</TE>
<TE>   "We have over 100 flavors, and many of them -- because people are
preferring indulgent, chunky flavors -- cost more to produce than
regular flavors like vanilla," said spokeswoman Dori Bailey. "We'd
like to keep the cost at a price that's more affordable."</TE>
<TE>   Butterfat prices have since fallen, said Rachel Kaldor, executive
director of the Dairy Institute of California. But, she said, ice
cream makers have a long memory when it comes to steep price
increases.</TE>
<TE>   Many producers would rather reduce volume than raise prices, which
have shot above the $5-a-tub mark for many premium brands.</TE>
<TE>   "They don't want their customers looking for alternatives" for
dessert, Kaldor said.</TE>
<TE>   There has been no adverse effect on sales, manufacturers say.
"We've had a few people say, 'Wait a minute, there's less ice cream
in this package,' " said John Nabholz, a spokesman for Schwan's Inc.,
a Minnesota-based home-delivery service that began selling
reduced-size tubs last year.</TE>
<TE>   But, he said, most people prefer the new packages to the brick,
which often opened at both ends, creating a mess.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts aren't predicting an ice cream industry meltdown.</TE>
<TE>   "Most consumers view ice cream as a luxury purchase, a small
indulgence, and are somewhat more price-elastic," said Eric Katzman,
food analyst for Deutsche Bank.</TE>
<TE>   Much of the industry, however, intends to stick with the
half-gallon to hold onto consumers concerned about cost.</TE>

<HD>Stock Rally Halted; Crude Oil Surges</HD>
<DH>Heating-fuel prices also rise as cold weather hits North.
Wal-Mart says November sales will be at low end of estimate.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Stocks closed modestly lower Monday as oil prices jumped and some
investors took profits from last week's rally.</LD>
<LD>   The Dow industrials slid 92.52 points, or 1.1%, to 8,486.57, after
adding 0.5% last week -- the sixth straight weekly gain.</LD>
<LD>   The Nasdaq composite lost 17.45 points, or 1.2%, to 1,393.69,
after rising 3.8% last week.</LD>
<TE>   Trading volume was moderate. Losers outnumbered winners by 18 to
14 on the New York Stock Exchange and by 19 to 14 on Nasdaq.</TE>
<TE>   Near-term crude oil futures prices jumped $1.20 to $26.71 a barrel
in New York, the biggest one-day gain in seven months, even as United
Nations weapons inspectors returned to Iraq for the first time in
four years.</TE>
<TE>   Traders said the surge in oil reflected skepticism that Iraq will
give the inspectors access to suspected weapons sites. That could
fuel renewed threats of war by the Bush administration.</TE>
<TE>   "What we're seeing is some skittishness from investors in the near
term about the prospects of war with Iraq," said Kevin Caron, market
strategist at Ryan, Beck &amp; Co.</TE>
<TE>   Crude oil futures also were pulled higher by rallies in heating
oil, which is refined from crude, and natural gas, a competing
heating fuel, Bloomberg News reported. Heating-fuel prices rose as
cold weather in northern parts of the U.S. boosted demand.</TE>
<TE>   On Wall Street, investors chipped away at some retail stocks after
Wal-Mart Stores predicted that November sales at stores open at least
a year will be at the low end of its forecast for a gain of 2% to 4%.
Wal-Mart lost $1.81 to $53.68. The stock has mostly traded between
$53 and $56 since Oct. 28.</TE>
<TE>   On the plus side, Toys R Us surged $2.25 to $12.65 after the toy
retailer reported a smaller-than-expected loss in the quarter ended
Nov. 2, and sounded optimistic about the holiday selling season.</TE>
<TE>   The stock market got a boost late last week on reports of
stronger-than-expected October retail sales and a rise in consumer
sentiment in November.</TE>
<TE>   "I think what the market feared as far as retail sales going into
the holiday is not going to happen," said Scott Wren, equity
strategist for A.G. Edwards &amp; Sons. "People are still going to be out
there spending money."</TE>
<TE>   As stocks rose last week, Treasury bond yields resurged. The
10-year T-note yield ended Friday at 4.03%, up from 3.86% a week
earlier. On Monday bond yields eased slightly, with the 10-year
T-note falling to 4%.</TE>
<TE>   Among Monday's highlights:</TE>
<TE>   * In the retail sector, Federated Department Stores lost $1.15 to
$31.71, Target slid $1.45 to $31.38 and Ross Stores slipped $1.28 to
$43.67, but Best Buy rose $1.56 to $22.31 and Home Depot added 28
cents to $28.60.</TE>
<TE>   Home Depot rival Lowe's slid $1.80 to $40.70 despite reporting
third-quarter earnings that beat analysts' expectations.</TE>
<TE>   * Among toy makers, Mattel gained 16 cents to $19.56 and Leapfrog
Enterprises added 15 cents to $32, a new high for the year.</TE>
<TE>   * Citigroup fell $1.08 to $35.82 on continued worries about
allegations that Chairman Sanford Weill may have sought to influence
Jack Grubman, a former Citigroup stock analyst, in Grubman's rating
of AT&amp;T shares in 1999. Weill has denied wrongdoing.</TE>
<TE>   Other bank stocks also were weak. Bank of America fell $1.38 to
$67.41 and Bank One lost 72 cents to $37.56.</TE>
<TE>   * AT&amp;T dropped 35 cents to $13.51 after Lehman Bros. cut the
firm's stock rating to "underweight" from "equal weight."</TE>
<TE>   * UAL led airline shares higher, soaring 55 cents to $3.50, after
the parent of United Airlines said it expected to cut 9,000 more jobs
as part of a restructuring to return to profitability.</TE>
<TE>   Among Southland issues, SCPIE Holdings jumped $1.04 to $7.02. The
medical malpractice insurance firm told the New York Stock Exchange
it had nothing new to report. The company held a conference call with
investors on Nov. 12 to discuss plans to divest certain operations.</TE>

<HD>Kmart Says It May Have Reversed Skidding Sales</HD>
<DH>Retailer is counting on holiday sales to help it emerge
from Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Kmart Corp. Chief Executive James Adamson said Monday that monthly
sales at the discount retailer may rise for the first time in more
than a year in December as shoppers buy more Martha Stewart
merchandise.</LD>
<LD>   Sales at stores open at least a year are expected to be "neutral
to slightly positive," Adamson said. Sales of Martha Stewart items
are "doing better on a per-store basis" this year, he said.</LD>
<LD>   Kmart needs to win back shoppers during the holiday shopping
season, when most retailers generate their largest percentage of
profit and sales, to help with plans to emerge from bankruptcy
protection in July. The largest U.S. retailer to make a bankruptcy
filing said it will consider stores' holiday sales, profitability and
competition in deciding whether to close more outlets.</LD>
<TE>   "The longer we are in Chapter 11, the more harmful it is," Adamson
said.</TE>
<TE>   Adamson said there was a "weakness" in store sales last week after
a stronger showing the previous week. Same-store sales fell less than
5% in October, he said. The company is scheduled to release
third-quarter results Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   Kmart shares were unchanged at 59 cents in New York Stock Exchange
composite trading.</TE>
<TE>   The Troy, Mich.-based retailer this month began selling Martha
Stewart holiday items, including ornaments, wreaths and lights.
Martha Stewart brand products, such as housewares, linens and
gardening tools, have been among Kmart's top-selling private-label
items.</TE>
<TE>   Stewart, chief executive of Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia Inc.,
has been under investigation in connection with possible insider
trading of shares of ImClone Systems Inc.</TE>

<HD>Medical Lender Files for Chapter 11</HD>
<DH>More than a hundred health-care firms may face losses in a
National Century collapse. An FBI probe is underway.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>National Century Financial Enterprises Inc., which sold at least
$3.35 billion of bonds to help finance health-care providers, filed
for bankruptcy protection Monday after investors balked at extending
credit.</LD>
<LD>   The bankruptcy filing comes two days after the FBI raided the
Dublin, Ohio-based company's offices.</LD>
<LD>   National Century's collapse may limit the ability of more than 100
health-care firms to meet expenses. Large investors such as Newport
Beach-based Pacific Investment Management Co. also face losses.</LD>
<TE>   David Coles, who was brought in from New York restructuring firm
Alvarez &amp; Marsal to manage National Century in the near term, said
the chances that the company will emerge from bankruptcy protection
are remote.</TE>
<TE>   National Century borrowed, via bonds, to buy medical bills from
health-care providers at a discount. The difference between what
National Century paid for the bills and the amount it eventually
collected was used to make interest payments on the bonds and to
provide a profit for the company.</TE>
<TE>   The health-care providers, such as PhyAmerica Physicians Group
Inc. and Med Diversified Inc., were willing to sell their bills at a
discount because they could be provided with an immediate and steady
stream of money to meet expenses, including payroll costs. Since
1991, National Century and its units have financed more than $15
billion in health-care claims.</TE>
<TE>   National Century's failure is rippling through its client ranks.
PhyAmerica, which supplies 1,600 emergency-room doctors in 29 states,
filed for bankruptcy protection a week ago.</TE>
<TE>   National Century's arrangements started to unravel over the last
month as Moody's Investors Service cut the credit ratings on more
than $3.35 billion of bonds issued by the firm to junk status.
Moody's said the company wrongly tapped into $325 million it had set
aside to back the bonds when its own financial situation
deteriorated.</TE>
<TE>   The company's financial problems led it to stop making payments to
clients, and its chief executive, Lance Poulsen, resigned Nov. 8.</TE>
<TE>   An FBI spokesman said the company is the subject of a federal
probe. Over the weekend, FBI agents filled a rental truck with
records from National Century's headquarters.</TE>
<TE>   The investors in the company's bonds included some of the biggest
institutional investors, including Pimco, Los Angeles-based Capital
Research and Management and Alliance Capital Management.</TE>
<TE>   Pimco fund manager Daniel Ivascyn said in an affidavit filed
Thursday that Poulsen on Oct. 29 acknowledged making "improper"
withdrawals from reserve accounts to pay fees to National Century.</TE>
<TE>   Poulsen "physically ejected" Ivascyn and other bondholder
representatives who traveled to National Century's offices in a
converted strip mall, according to the court document. The investors
were seeking explanations from Poulsen, the document said.</TE>
<TE>   On Sunday, Pimco said it owned $283 million of National Century's
bonds, or less than one-tenth of 1% of the $401 billion managed by
Pimco.</TE>
<TE>   Ambac Financial Group Inc., a major bond insurer, said Monday that
it would write down by 70% the $174.5 million in National
Century-sponsored debt it owns.</TE>

<HD>Latino Nissan Buyers Pay More, Study Says</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Karen Robinson-Jacobs</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Latinos in Florida who financed their car purchases through Nissan
Motor Acceptance Corp. routinely paid higher interest rates than
white consumers with similar credit histories, according to a study
recently released as part of a class- action lawsuit.</LD>
<LD>   The suit, filed in U.S. District Court in Nashville, alleges that
the lending policies of Nissan Acceptance, a wholly owned subsidiary
of Torrance-based Nissan North America Inc., discriminate against
African American consumers.</LD>
<LD>   Nissan officials deny the allegation.</LD>
<TE>   To bolster their case, which is set to go to trial in February,
the plaintiffs commissioned first a study of African American
consumers nationwide, and last month added a study of Latinos.
Researchers chose Latinos in Florida because it was easier to obtain
race-based information from that state's Department of Motor
Vehicles, a source close to the case said.</TE>
<TE>   The case involves the practice of allowing the dealer to charge
consumers a markup over the interest rate charged by the
manufacturer's finance company based on credit scores.</TE>
<TE>   A Nissan attorney described markups as "uniform industry practice
that's been going on for years."</TE>
<TE>   But the plaintiffs allege the effect is discriminatory.</TE>
<TE>   Even when looking at customers with the best credit ratings,
Latinos in Florida had a markup, on average, of $536 over the life of
the loan.</TE>
<TE>   That compared with a markup of $283 for white customers, according
to the study by Mark A. Cohen, a professor of management at
Vanderbilt University.</TE>
<TE>   Among consumers with the worst credit ratings, Latinos paid $966
on average in markups, whereas whites paid $805, the study showed.</TE>
<TE>   Alan Hunn, one of the Nissan attorneys handling the case, said the
company "flatly denies the allegation."</TE>
<TE>   He said the study does not adequately control for a variety of
factors including dealer incentives, the cost of the vehicle and even
credit scores -- which can have a substantial effect on the final
deal.</TE>
<TE>   "Our contention is that if you control for all of these variables,
you get the same credit treatment for all customers," said Hunn, who
acknowledged that the rate charged a consumer could be as much as
three points higher than the rate charged by the financing arm.</TE>
<TE>   Though the new study focuses on Latinos, Stuart Rossman, one of
the attorneys for the plaintiffs, said the Tennessee case will not be
amended to include Latino consumers because it is so close to its
trial date.</TE>
<TE>   But separately, Rosemary Shahan, president of Consumers for Auto
Reliability and Safety, said she has had discussions, as recently as
last week, with attorneys who plan to file a similar class-action
suit in California based on experiences of Latino consumers here.</TE>

<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Orange County Register Editor Tonnie L. Katz has resigned from the
Santa Ana-based newspaper to spend more time with her family, the
company said.</LD>
<LD>   Katz, 57, had just concluded a four-month personal leave of
absence when she announced her resignation on Friday. She joined the
Register in 1988 as assistant managing editor and became managing
editor a year later. She was tapped for the paper's top editorial
position in 1992.</LD>
<LD>   Katz is being replaced by Ken Brusic, 58, who was named senior
vice president for content and strategy this year. Brusic has been
with the Register since 1989. He became managing editor in 1992 and
executive editor in 1997.</LD>
<TE>   On Monday, Brusic said he does not expect any "radical changes
from the direction we've had in the past five years or so."</TE>
<TE>   Katz could not be reached for comment.</TE>
<TE>   While Katz was editor, the Register, which has a daily circulation
of 300,000, won a Pulitzer Prize for investigative journalism for its
stories disclosing fraudulent and unethical practices in the
fertility clinic at UC Irvine.</TE>

<LD>The government is increasing scrutiny of companies that process beef,

<LD>   The Agriculture Department issued a directive to its inspectors
ordering increased oversight for companies that don't have testing
programs of their own or who keep the results of such tests to
themselves.</LD>
<LD>   The directive is in response to outbreaks of listeriosis in the

<HD>Warnaco Executive Accepts Severance Cut</HD>

<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Linda J. Wachner, once among the highest-paid corporate executives,
settled her $25.1-million severance claim against Warnaco Group Inc.
for less than 2% of the amount, the clothing company said.</LD>
<LD>   The former Warnaco chairman, blamed by some investors for the
company's collapse before she was ousted last November after 14 years
at the helm, was paid about $90.1 million in salary, bonuses and
stock options from 1998 through 2000. Warnaco lost about $219 million
during that period.</LD>
<LD>   Under the settlement, Wachner would get $200,000 in cash plus what
amounts to an unsecured $3.5-million IOU that is worth only a
fraction of its face value, Warnaco said in its quarterly report to
the Securities and Exchange Commission.</LD>
<TE>   The claim is worth about 7.2 cents on the dollar, meaning Wachner
would receive about $250,000 when the bankruptcy reorganization is
concluded, according to court papers. The accord is subject to
approval by a federal bankruptcy judge.</TE>

<HD>SBA OKs Risky Loans, Watchdog Says</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Larry Margasak</AU>
<BD>Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Despite warnings that it is risking millions in bad debts, the Small
Business Administration has approved dozens of loan guarantees
annually for borrowers who should have been disqualified because they
previously defaulted.</LD>
<LD>   The agency designed to help America's small businesses rejected a
recommendation in May from its inspector general to implement a
system of intensive checks to screen applicants. SBA officials say
they consider the failure to identify previous loan defaulters a
minor problem.</LD>
<LD>   "This is more the tip of an ice cube rather than the tip of an
iceberg," said Jim Hammersley, director of the office of loan
programs for the SBA.</LD>
<TE>   The amount of bad loans the SBA has been forced to cover has
almost doubled, from $516 million in 1995 to more than $1 billion in
fiscal 2002, which ended Sept. 30. An agency spokesman said the
increase reflects expansion of the overall lending program from $3
billion in 1990 to $12 billion last year.</TE>
<TE>   Under agency rules, borrowers with defaults in any federal lending
program should be ineligible for SBA-backed loans, unless an
exception is granted.</TE>
<TE>   The inspector general's report last spring identified as many as
166 loan guarantees the agency made to companies with federal loan
defaults. It was unclear whether any of the 166 had received official
exceptions.</TE>
<TE>   "Providing loan guarantees to such applicants caused SBA to honor
or be at risk to honor guarantees totaling about $22.4 million," the
inspector general reported after reviewing loans approved from
October 1995 to April 2001.</TE>
<TE>   The agency does not lend money directly to small-business owners
but issues loan guarantees, or promises to pay commercial lenders if
the borrower defaults. The SBA tries to recover money from a
defaulted borrower.</TE>

<HD>Tenet Says SEC Has Launched Informal Probe</HD>
<DH>The hospital chain's chairman discloses the agency's
interest in an open letter. He also discusses troubles that have
battered the firm's stock and reputation.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Don Lee and Ronald D. White</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Hospital chain Tenet Healthcare Corp., already under federal scrutiny
for its Medicare reimbursements, said Monday that the Securities and
Exchange Commission has begun an informal inquiry into the company,
including examining the unusually high volume of Tenet stock trades
in the last few weeks.</LD>
<LD>   In an open letter to shareholders, Tenet's chairman and chief
executive, Jeffrey C. Barbakow, said company officials met with
regional SEC representatives last week. Tenet officials said the
two-hour-long meeting included questions about Tenet's Medicare
payments and about sales of Tenet shares by company insiders.</LD>
<LD>   Barbakow said he did not know whether the SEC intends to launch a
formal investigation, but he said the Santa Barbara-based company was
cooperating fully. In a formal investigation the SEC typically
obtains subpoena powers to gather additional information.</LD>
<TE>   SEC officials on Monday declined to comment.</TE>
<TE>   Tenet's disclosure of the SEC meeting was not a surprise to
investors, given the recent series of high-profile events that have
battered the credibility and stock price of the nation's
second-largest hospital chain.</TE>
<TE>   During the last three weeks the FBI has raided a Tenet hospital in
Redding, Calif., where two doctors are being investigated for
allegedly performing numerous unnecessary heart operations, and the
Department of Health and Human Services has launched an audit of
Tenet's sizable Medicare billings. And on Nov. 7, Barbakow replaced
two of his top executives as part of a management shake-up at the
company.</TE>
<TE>   The two Redding doctors, Chae Hyun Moon and Fidel Realyvasquez,
have not been charged with wrongdoing. But Tenet has retained outside
physicians to review pending cases of the doctors' patients before
allowing them to perform new procedures. So far, three bypass
surgeries that Realyvasquez approved have been rejected by an outside
cardiac doctor, a source at Redding Medical Center said.</TE>
<TE>   The federal audit of Tenet focuses on Medicare funds known as
"outlier payments." These payments are made in addition to fixed
Medicare reimbursements to help hospitals defray expense for
unusually costly treatments, such as cardiac procedures.</TE>
<TE>   Tenet has acknowledged that it pursued an ill-advised strategy of
aggressively raising retail hospital prices, which are used to
calculate outlier payments. But the company has maintained that it
did not break any Medicare rules.</TE>
<TE>   On Monday, Tom Scully, administrator of the federal Centers for
Medicare and Medicaid Services, said he expected to announce as early
as this week some limited steps to exert more control over Medicare's
outlier payments. Scully said broader changes in outlier regulations
would take at least three months.</TE>
<TE>   In an interview, Scully sharply criticized Tenet for boosting
hospital prices, allowing it to collect an unusually large amount of
the outlier payments. Scully said Tenet's practices may not have been
illegal, "but they were clearly inappropriate and unethical."</TE>
<TE>   On the whole, Barbakow's letter Monday was received favorably by
investors and analysts, largely because it included news that the
company last week bought 10 million shares under a previously
authorized stock repurchase plan.</TE>
<TE>   Despite a tough day on Wall Street, Tenet shares rose $2.42, or
15%, to $18.75 on the New York Stock Exchange. The stock has inched
up since dropping to $13.70 last week, but it remains well below a
52-week high of $52.30 in early October.</TE>
<TE>   "It was comforting to know that management was back in the open
market buying shares," said Darren Lehrich, an analyst at SunTrust
Robinson Humphrey in New York. Still, Lehrich said he would continue
to advise investors to avoid Tenet's stock.</TE>
<TE>   Some analysts said they thought the SEC might be looking at the
timing of Tenet's disclosure of the hospital raid and Medicare audit.</TE>
<TE>   On Monday Christi R. Sulzbach, Tenet's executive vice president
and general counsel, said that SEC officials did not ask questions
about these disclosures during their meeting last Tuesday, which she
attended. Rather, she said, they asked about any unusual trading by
investors. Tenet does not track third-party stock trades, Sulzbach
said, and although the SEC raised the issue of insider trading, the
company did not believe that was a problem.</TE>
<TE>   In the last couple of months some Tenet directors and senior
management exercised stock options. On Oct. 4, for example, Thomas B.
Mackey, Tenet's chief operating officer, exercised options on 277,500
shares at $51.50, grossing about $10 million.</TE>
<TE>   A month later, Mackey and Tenet Chief Financial Officer David
Dennis left the company after Barbakow, who said he didn't know about
the company's heavy reliance on outlier payments, expressed a loss of
confidence in the executives.</TE>
<TE>   In his letter to shareholders, Barbakow wrote that "many have
questioned whether the cause of those departures was some deeper
problem than what we had disclosed. The answer, emphatically, is NO."</TE>
<TE>   Barbakow also disclosed Monday that the organization that
accredits hospitals nationally has begun a separate review of Tenet.</TE>
<TE>   Charlene Hill, a spokeswoman for the Joint Commission on
Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations, said her group has an
"aggressive plan" to look at some of Tenet's hospitals to make sure
they are in compliance with quality and patient-safety standards.</TE>

<HD>Tire Data Location Rules Are Issued</HD>
<DH>NHTSA requirements should make safety information easier
for motorists to find.</DH>

<LD>Motorists should find it easier to locate critical information about
their tires under new rules issued by federal regulators Monday in
response to the Firestone tire debacle two years ago.</LD>
<LD>   Starting September 2003, vehicle manufacturers will be required to
standardize the location of more colorful notices on recommended tire
pressures, placing them on the driver-side door pillar.</LD>
<LD>   A year later, tire makers will be required to phase in placement
of the tire identification number and the date of manufacture on both
sides of a tire to help consumers more easily see whether their tires
are subject to a recall.</LD>
<TE>   Most of the rules, issued by the National Highway Traffic Safety
Administration, were required by legislation passed by Congress in
2000 in response to the failure of certain Firestone tires that were
fitted mostly to Explorer sport utility vehicles made by Ford Motor
Co.</TE>
<TE>   Deaths and injuries linked to the tread separations and blowouts
led to recalls of millions of tires made by Firestone, a unit of
Japan's Bridgestone Corp.</TE>
<TE>   Tire identification information sometimes is available only from
the side of the tire visible from under the vehicle. And vehicle
makers put recommended tire inflation notices in a variety of
locations, including the glove box and the trunk.</TE>
<TE>   "We were amazed how many people in our research didn't even know
that the thing existed, never mind where to find it," said Roger
Kurrus, who oversees NHTSA's consumer communication campaigns.</TE>
<TE>   The new rules also include a requirement that automakers put more
tire safety information in the owner's manual, including a discussion
of the importance of correct tire inflation and the consequences of
underinflation.</TE>
<TE>   The changes in display of tire identification information will be
phased in over 12 months beginning Sept. 1, 2004, when 40% of tires
must comply. Over the following year, 70% will have to conform, and
all tires will have to meet the new rules by Sept. 1, 2006.</TE>
<TE>   The gradual introduction will give tire makers time to make molds
with the identification and date of manufacture on both sides, an
NHTSA official said.</TE>

<HD>UAL to Slash More Wages; Pilots OK Deal</HD>

<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>CHICAGO</DL>
<LD>United Airlines, stepping up the campaign to avoid a bankruptcy
filing by getting a federal loan guarantee, Monday outlined wage cuts
for nonunion workers as union pilots ratified 18% givebacks.</LD>
<LD>   Pilots were the first major labor group to reach a deal with
management on pay cuts. Monday, the 8,800-member Air Line Pilots
Assn. approved its portion of concessions by a wide margin. The cuts,
set to take effect Dec. 1, will rely on other labor groups taking
part in an overall financial recovery plan.</LD>
<LD>   As United Airlines' fate hangs in the balance, flight attendants
are voting on their portion of a $5.8-billion concession package
submitted by a five-member union coalition. Machinists still have not
reached a tentative deal, but are said to be close.</LD>
<TE>   Shares of United parent UAL Corp. rose 55 cents to close at $3.50
on the New York Stock Exchange after the airline released news Sunday
and Monday, including more details on efforts to win federal
assistance.</TE>
<TE>   The stock has more than doubled its lowest level of $1.42 a share
in October, but is still off about 70% this year as the bankruptcy
filing threat looms.</TE>
<TE>   The No. 2 U.S. airline, based in Elk Grove Village, Ill., unveiled
a number of details, including the fact that salaried and management
workers will take pay cuts of 3% to 11% and forgo merit increases.
That is part of an overall financial recovery plan that calls for
those workers, excluding officers of the company, to contribute about
$1.3 billion in wage cuts and productivity.</TE>
<TE>   The airline said Sunday that it would cut 9,000 employees and trim
flight capacity by 6%.</TE>
<TE>   United outlined the nonunion pay cuts a day after it released
details of an "updated business plan" submitted to the Air
Transportation Stabilization Board. The agency, created after the
Sept. 11 attacks, is weighing whether to grant United backing for
$1.8 billion of a $2-billion loan.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts said that at the end of the day, all that matters for
United in the near term is the ATSB decision.</TE>
<TE>   UAL lost a record $2.1 billion in 2001 and so far in 2002 has
recorded $1.7 billion in losses. The airline is burning through $8
million to $10 million a day in cash.</TE>
<TE>   Jamie Baker, airline analyst at J.P. Morgan Chase &amp; Co., saw the
news on various pay cuts and capacity shrinkage as more of a public
relations gambit than a substantive change. Baker does not own shares
in UAL.</TE>

<HD>SEC to Consider New Rules on Audit Teams</HD>
<DH>Proposals include a limit on the tenure of lead accountants
and restrictions on non-accounting work.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Heads of corporate audit teams -- the bean counters who vouch for
companies' financial records -- would be barred from serving one
client for more than five years in a row, under rules to be
considered today by the Securities and Exchange Commission.</LD>
<LD>   The SEC is tackling dozens of corporate and accounting reforms
ordered by Congress after a rash of business scandals that tarnished
the reputations of corporate accountants.</LD>
<LD>   The agency also is set to examine proposed rules to make auditors
hold on to important audit records for up to five years.</LD>
<TE>   Those and other measures were scheduled to go before the SEC in a
public hearing today. After discussion, the rules were expected to be
proposed formally and sent out for public comment.</TE>
<TE>   Auditor independence became an issue in Congress' scandal-driven
reform push this summer, as legislators focused on ties between
accounting firm Arthur Andersen and energy giant Enron Corp. Andersen
was paid hefty fees as both auditor and consultant to Enron.</TE>
<TE>   When the Sarbanes-Oxley Act was passed in July, it included
outlines for rules to combat conflicts of interest between auditors
and clients. The act left many of the details up to the SEC and a new
accounting oversight board.</TE>
<TE>   Proposed rules coming before the SEC today also would bar
accounting firms from auditing companies whose managers include a
former member of a firm's audit team.</TE>
<TE>   Accounting firms would have to win the approval of a company's
audit committee for the sale of all audit and non-audit services to a
company. Restrictions on the sale of some non-audit services also
will be reviewed by the SEC.</TE>
<TE>   SEC staffers said that under the restrictions, non-audit work
would be barred if it resulted in an auditor's auditing its own work,
acting as a member of corporate management or being an advocate for
the company.</TE>
<TE>   Another rule would require auditors to keep work papers and other
documents from an audit for five years. That measure followed the
June 15 conviction of Andersen for obstruction of justice tied to the
destruction of Enron audit records.</TE>
<TE>   SEC Chairman Harvey L. Pitt resigned Nov. 5 after being criticized
for his handling of the nomination of former federal judge William H.
Webster to chair the new accounting oversight board.</TE>
<TE>   Webster resigned last week. Pitt remains on the job pending White
House nomination of a successor.</TE>

<HD>FASB Seeks Feedback on Options Proposal</HD>

<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>U.S. accounting-rule makers asked for feedback Monday on a proposal
by an international accounting standards board to force companies to
expense stock options, reopening a debate on a thorny topic that has
much of corporate America already up in arms.</LD>
<LD>   The Financial Accounting Standards Board is asking for comment on
an International Accounting Standards Board proposal issued this
month on options expensing.</LD>
<LD>   The move by the London-based IASB, which is developing global
accounting rules, would force companies to treat stock option costs
as regular business costs and as a result threatens to depress
corporate profits.</LD>
<TE>   U.S. companies have fought bitterly against the move over the
years. However, a number of big companies announced this summer that
they would voluntarily expense stock options in a bid to restore
investor confidence shattered by accounting scandals.</TE>
<TE>   Under current U.S. accounting rules, companies may treat stock
options as an expense or simply disclose the cost in the footnotes of
their annual report.</TE>
<TE>   FASB, which will continue to write accounting rules even after the
U.S. accounting oversight board is up and running, is in favor of a
policy requiring companies to expense stock options. But FASB was
beaten back by politicians and corporate lobbyists when it tried to
introduce such a rule in the mid-1990s.</TE>
<TE>   FASB will solicit comments until Feb. 1.</TE>

<HD>Appeals Court Allows Yahoo E-Mail Search</HD>
<DH>Case involving accused child pornographer tests whether
seizures can be made without the direct supervision of law
enforcement officers.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Mary Wisniewski</AU>
<BD>Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Yahoo Inc.'s search of an accused child pornographer's e-mails
without a police officer present did not violate the defendant's
privacy rights, a U.S. appeals court ruled Monday.</LD>
<LD>   The U.S. 8th Circuit Court of Appeals reversed a judge's decision
that barred the use of e-mails as evidence against Dale Robert Bach,
who is charged with manufacturing, possessing and transmitting child
pornography.</LD>
<LD>   U.S. District Judge Paul Magnuson had ruled that the seizure of
the e-mails was unlawful because police weren't present when Bach's
Yahoo account was searched.</LD>
<TE>   The case is among the first to test whether e-mail may be searched
without the direct supervision of law enforcement officers. Yahoo
says the requirement is an unreasonable burden on Internet service
providers that would disrupt operations.</TE>
<TE>   "Civilian searches are sometimes more reasonable than searches by
officers," a three-judge panel concluded, in a unanimous opinion.</TE>
<TE>   Sunnyvale, Calif.-based Yahoo routinely is served with search
warrants by police seeking information about subscribers. In the Bach
case, police in St. Paul, Minn., faxed a copy of the search warrant
for his e-mails to Yahoo, though officers weren't present during
their retrieval.</TE>
<TE>   The appeals court is based in St. Paul and Monday's ruling applies
in Minnesota, Arkansas, Iowa, Missouri, Nebraska, North Dakota and
South Dakota.</TE>
<TE>   "This gives great comfort to Internet service providers," said
Jonathan Band, an attorney with the San Francisco law firm of
Morrison &amp; Foerster, who wrote a legal brief on behalf of Yahoo and
other Internet providers supporting the government in the Bach case.</TE>
<TE>   Bach's attorney, Bill Orth, said he intends to ask the full court
to look at the Bach case.</TE>
<TE>   He said the panel didn't assess whether e-mail is entitled to
privacy, nor did the judges address the fact that Internet service
providers can't be sued for the way they respond to a warrant.</TE>
<TE>   "They were looking for the easy way out," Orth said of the
decision. "This is not over."</TE>
<TE>   Orth had argued that e-mail deserves the same privacy protection
as letters mailed through the U.S. Postal Service.</TE>
<TE>   Yahoo, the operator of the world's most popular Internet search
engine, said there will be more search warrants for e-mails when the
Council of Europe Cybercrime Convention takes effect.</TE>
<TE>   The treaty allows foreign governments to request information from
U.S. Internet service providers.</TE>
<TE>   Letting a Yahoo technician make the "first cut" in responding to a
warrant reduces the volume of information a police officer must deal
with, the company had argued to the 8th Circuit.</TE>
<TE>   Federal prosecutors last year charged Bach with eight counts of
possessing, transmitting, receiving and manufacturing child
pornography. Bach was convicted in 1995 of molesting a 14-year-old
boy.</TE>

<HD>Apple for the Teacher Was Rotten to the Core</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Arianna Huffington</AU>
<BD>Arianna Huffington writes a syndicated column. E-mail:
arianna@ariannaonline.com.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>All right, children, gather 'round. It's time to practice our ABCs: A
is for apple, B is for baby -- and C is for Citigroup and crony
capitalism, the subject of today's lesson.</LD>
<LD>   Wall Street's credibility was downgraded to junk status last week
after it came to light that former superstar telecom analyst Jack
Grubman had upgraded his rating of AT&amp;T stock after his boss,
Citigroup Chairman Sandy Weill, helped Grubman get his twins into a
very exclusive New York City nursery school. Citigroup shortly
thereafter donated $1 million to the 92nd Street YMCA, which runs the
school. Think of it as a neat little example of corporate Quid Pro
Play-Doh.</LD>
<LD>   The headline-grabbing revelation was contained in a Grubman e-mail
uncovered by crusading New York state Atty. Gen. Eliot Spitzer, who
is investigating why Grubman suddenly turned bullish on AT&amp;T after
having long treated it like the telecom industry's ugly stepchild.</LD>
<TE>   The abrupt about-face is particularly suspect given that just five
months after Grubman raised his rating on the company from "hold" to
"buy," his firm was picked to help handle the phone giant's
$10.6-billion IPO for its wireless division. Another red flag is the
fact that soon after the wireless stock went public -- and Weill and
Grubman's firm had raked in $45 million -- Grubman again turned sour
on AT&amp;T.</TE>
<TE>   In the same e-mail, Grubman claims that nursery school
intervention was not the only reason he boosted his rating of AT&amp;T.
It was also done to help Weill win a power struggle at Citigroup by
currying the favor of AT&amp;T Chief Executive C. Michael Armstrong, a
member of Citigroup's board of directors. According to Jack the Stock
Tipper, Weill was hoping that Armstrong would help him "nuke" his
then-co- executive at Citicorp, John Reed. Making matters all the
cozier, Weill was also a member of the AT&amp;T board.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, as soon as the e-mail hit the fan, everyone involved
issued the predictable heated and shocked! shocked! denials that
anything unseemly had occurred. Grubman even went so far as to commit
corporate seppuku by deriding his own cyber-assertions as
"inappropriate," "silly," "baseless" and "nothing more than an
extended invented story" meant to "inflate my professional
importance."</TE>
<TE>   And the moral of the story is how Grubman's missive exposes again
the too-close-for-comfort way that business really gets done in this
country.</TE>
<TE>   Our fragile economy is in the slippery grip of a crony capitalism
practiced by a small group of insiders who sit on each other's
boards, join each other's country clubs, help each other's kids get
into the best schools and line each other's pockets -- even if that
means fleecing little-guy investors, pension funds and 401(k)s.</TE>
<TE>   Don't you wonder what Spitzer will uncover next? In my dreams, a
source provides me with an exclusive preview of a new collection of
damning e-mails written by Grubman.</TE>
<TE>   In one, Grubman tells a friend that the real reason he tirelessly
touted Global Crossing was not because of the company's plan to build
a worldwide undersea fiber-optic network but because company Chairman
Gary Winnick had helped Grubman land a Saturday night reservation at
Nobu, convinced Frederic Fekkai to add some highlights to his wife's
hair and arranged to have the Wiggles perform at the twins'
third-birthday party. In another, he owns up to the fact that he
urged investors to buy WorldCom because Bernie Ebbers had scored
tickets for Grubman to Vanity Fair's Oscar party and gotten his
daughters' beloved nanny a round of injections from Botox queen Pat
Wexler. And in a third e-mail in my fantasy, Grubman admits that he
gave Verizon a series of glowing stock reports only after company CEO
Ivan Seidenberg took a personal interest in the Grubman girls'
education, persuading Annie Liebovitz to take their class photo,
Quincy Jones to write a new school song and Donatella Versace to
design new school uniforms. Seidenberg even used the Verizon
corporate jet to fly the entire nursery school to Milan for the
fittings.</TE>
<TE>   Getting ahead in the corporate world is as simple as A-B-C.</TE>

<HD>Prepare for an Urban Nightmare</HD>
<DH>War against Iraq could lead to a heavy toll both there and
here.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>James P. Pinkerton</AU>

York. E-mail: pinkerto@ix.netcom.com</BD>

<LD>The conventional wisdom in Washington holds that an attack on Iraq is
coming soon. But the reality of urban warfare in the Middle East --
the Israelis learned a bloody lesson Friday -- suggests that maybe
the United States won't be "good to go" as soon as most have thought.</LD>
<LD>   The chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, Sen. Bob Graham
(D-Fla.), seemed to let the cat out of the bag Nov. 12. Asked by a
Washington Post reporter about the status of homeland security, he
answered that terrorist cells were still ready to strike, adding:
"There will be hell to pay if we don't use the next 60 days to do
everything in our power to dismantle their capability."</LD>
<LD>   Graham was hinting that the U.S. had two months to preempt trouble
here at home before we could make trouble for Saddam Hussein -- an
action that would surely inspire a surge in terrorist activity.</LD>
<TE>   It's a commonplace in Washington that an Iraq attack must come
during the cool winter months because American warriors won't be able
to function in "chem-bio" gear in high temperatures.</TE>
<TE>   But new evidence suggests that the Pentagon might want to wait
before "going downtown." That's the slangy parlance of military
planners describing an operation against Baghdad, a city of 4.8
million.</TE>
<TE>   In the Monday issue of Air Force Times, Robert F. Dorr declares:
"If our leaders seriously intend to fight in metropolitan centers, I
hope they'll think again. I want to run through the halls of the
Pentagon crying out, 'Stalingrad!' Or perhaps, 'Hue!' And certainly,
because it never can be shouted too often, 'Mogadishu!' "</TE>
<TE>   Stalingrad was the Russian city where about 330,000 Nazi soldiers
were annihilated in block-by-block fighting against the Soviet Red
Army in 1942-1943. Hue was the former imperial capital of Vietnam
that the communists overran in 1968; anyone curious about the
three-week ordeal of the Marine Corps in recapturing that metropolis
might want to watch the last hour of the 1987 Stanley Kubrick film
"Full Metal Jacket." And the 1993 catastrophe in Mogadishu, Somalia,
is memorialized in the 2001 film "Blackhawk Down."</TE>
<TE>   The Army is acutely aware of those difficult precedents. The name
of the mock enemy city used to train soldiers is "Shughart-Gordon,"
in honor of two Rangers who won the Medal of Honor -- posthumously --
in Somalia. Lately, the Pentagon has been inviting journalists to
visit this proving ground at Ft. Polk, La. Invariably, reporters come
back using words such as "primordial" to describe the combat
conditions being simulated there.</TE>
<TE>   From a policy planning point of view, the Ft. Polk press tours
were a public relations "mission accomplished" for the Army brass in
their quiet struggle with their civilian bosses at the Pentagon.</TE>
<TE>   The civilians -- few of whom have personally experienced fighting
-- had an ambitious plan for winning the Iraq war on the cheap. Their
idea was that as few as 40,000 men would make a quick "vertical
insertion" into Baghdad from the air. The civvies were open in their
disdain for uniformed careerists, such as Gen. Tommy Franks, who
insisted instead on deploying 250,000 personnel "in theater." But
now, when an urban assault comes, it will surely include tanks, which
were the missing ingredient in the Mogadishu disaster. And it takes
time to ship armor all the way from Ft. Hood, Texas.</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, events in the West Bank have a indirectly bolstered the
Army's big-buildup argument.</TE>
<TE>   On Friday, a dozen Israeli soldiers and security men were killed
and 15 were injured in a Palestinian ambush in Hebron. This bloody
debacle befell a military that has trained itself in house-to-house
fighting for more than 50 years.</TE>
<TE>   Given this latest escalation, the chances that the Al
Jazeera-TV-watching Arab "street" will welcome an invasion by
Israel's ally, the U.S., seem even slimmer than they ever were.</TE>
<TE>   The reality that we're in a long-term conflict with many angry
Arabs suggests the need to get serious about homeland security, as
Sen. Graham says. And it's yet another signal to the "ground
pounders" in the Army to get fully ready for a rough reception when
they go downtown, to the meanest streets of all.</TE>

<HD>A Silver Spoon Is Gouging Unions</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Robert Scheer</AU>
<BD>Robert Scheer is a syndicated columnist.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>President Bush, a scion of great wealth who has never had to earn an
honest living, has abruptly wiped out the jobs, retirement security
and health benefits of 850,000 blue- and white-collar federal
workers. Always bailed out of losing business ventures by his daddy
or a family friend, Bush apparently finds it easy to play games with
the livelihood of ordinary Americans as a way of punishing unions
that opposed him at election time.</LD>
<LD>   The move to privatize half of the federal civilian jobs is
shortsighted, with negative consequences likely for the economy and
democracy and potentially for national security.</LD>
<LD>   It's politics and not policy as the administration launches yet
another partisan strike at its opponents, this time in the form of a
presidential edict that takes effect in 30 days, without being
debated by Congress.</LD>
<TE>   Government civil service has been a central mechanism for ensuring
the growth of a stable middle class, a cornerstone of a stable
democracy. And it is this middle class that drives the strong, steady
consumerism that economists have cited as the key to why the
sputtering economy has not snowballed into something worse. Yet to
compensate for sinking the national budget deep into the red by his
throwing money at the upper class through regressive tax cuts and
defense contractors with boondoggles pushed through in a post-9/11
haze, Bush wants to cut the income and benefits of nearly a million
civil servants.</TE>
<TE>   While the jobs affected range from military logistics experts to
computer programmers, working-class jobs at the lower end are
especially targeted. Entry-level government jobs are frequently the
basis of a family's ascension to a life of dignity and opportunity.
When we note that high-ranking civilian officials will not see pay
cuts but instead hope to see political gains, it becomes clearer how
fitting this edict is for an administration run by ex-CEOs.</TE>
<TE>   Workers holding secure jobs that provide a living wage can and
will be replaced by low-paid crews without benefits because that is
the only way to get the big "savings" Bush is after. But is it really
better for the nation if the president's house is painted by men and
women hired from a street-corner hiring hall at minimum wage? What if
subcontractors use foreign or undocumented labor? And will it be
easier for terrorists to infiltrate the government?</TE>
<TE>   This is especially galling, although not surprising, coming from
an administration run by veterans of rip-off companies like Enron,
the vanguard of an unchecked pandemic of greed that has wiped out so
many pension funds and jobs. Now the ax will again fall on the middle
class, in the form of elimination of jobs in which wages and working
conditions are guaranteed by enlightened social legislation rather
than the vagaries of a spot labor market.</TE>
<TE>   This "race-to-the-bottom" budget gimmick is as phony as it is
repugnant. Low-paid workers without medical benefits will pay less in
taxes, spend less at the mall and clog emergency rooms when their
children have strep throat. And without unions to monitor workplace
safety and environmental regulations, the economy will suffer as more
sick and injured workers become a drain on productivity.</TE>
<TE>   So why would the White House pursue such a policy? Simply put, the
Bushies hate unions because they are the steadiest opponents of
corporate consolidation, the transfer of jobs overseas and the
thievery of greedy accountants and CEOs. In other words, strong
unions are still anathema on the corporate gravy train that fattened
Bush, Dick Cheney and a historic number of fellow administration
honchos.</TE>
<TE>   The mostly stable prosperity of the post-Depression era is not an
automatic byproduct of the free market. It must be credited in large
part to smart government regulation and the work of strong unions
that protect consumers and workers.</TE>
<TE>   For Bush now to launch a full-scale attack on the gains of the
labor movement is to subvert the foundations of the American dream.</TE>

<HD>Will Blix See a Fig Leaf but Ignore Smoking Gun?</HD>
<DH>It's uncertain whether U.N. inspection chief is a match for
the wily Hussein.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Amir Taheri</AU>
<BD>Amir Taheri is the author of "The Cauldron: The Middle
East Behind the Headlines" (Hutchinson, 1995). E-mail:

<DL></DL>
<LD>Hans Blix, the 74-year-old Swedish diplomat who heads the United
Nations' team of weapons inspectors, is the central act in a
three-ring circus that will decide whether there will be another war
in Iraq soon. But it's beginning to look like Blix believes that his
mission is not to discover Saddam Hussein's hidden arsenal but to
produce a diplomatic fig leaf that could render war impossible.</LD>
<LD>   The first ring in Cirque du Blix consists of the power struggle
within the Bush administration. On the one hand, there are those
committed to nothing less than regime change. On the other are
advocates of a new version of "containment" under which Hussein will
be kept in "his cage" until fate decrees something better for the
Iraqi people.</LD>
<LD>   The second ring plays out in the United Nations Security Council
in New York, where French, Russian and Chinese veto holders are
fighting to keep the Iraqi president in power as long as possible.</LD>
<TE>   Blix's show in Baghdad will determine the outcome of the struggles
in Washington and New York.</TE>
<TE>   The Swedish diplomat has tried to minimize his role, insisting
that any decision on war remains with the Security Council. Although
technically true, this does not tell the whole story.</TE>
<TE>   A Blix report that says Iraq has no weapons of mass destruction
would make it diplomatically difficult for the Americans to take
military action against Hussein. On the other hand, no amount of
French and Russian chicanery could save Hussein if Blix reported that
Iraq had weapons of mass destruction and was hiding them.</TE>
<TE>   There already are indications that we may witness the shaping of
the mother of all diplomatic fudges.</TE>
<TE>   Let's start with the Security Council's decision to accept the
Iraqi response to Resolution 1441 -- the United Nations' measure that
provides for "tough and aggressive" weapons inspections in Iraq --
without closer scrutiny.</TE>
<TE>   Iraq's response Wednesday does not contain an explicit and
unconditional acceptance, as had been demanded by the Security
Council, but simply says that Iraq shall "deal with Resolution 1441."
The Arabic text is even more ambiguous and could be interpreted to
say that the Iraqis shall "confront" the resolution.</TE>
<TE>   The phrase "accepting unconditionally" came orally from Iraq's
envoy to the United Nations, Mohammed Douri, whose weight within the
Iraqi system is no more than that of a messenger boy.</TE>
<TE>   President Bush had dismissed the Iraqi parliament's rejection of
1441 as unimportant, saying he would wait for Hussein to take a
position. Yet Hussein has not taken a position; his propaganda is
telling the Iraqi people that he has just won another great
diplomatic victory by trapping "the American and Zionist enemy" into
a diplomatic process beyond their control.</TE>
<TE>   Of even greater concern are some of Blix's more recent
pronouncements. In an avalanche of interviews and confidences, Blix
has said three things that are significant:</TE>
<TE>   * He does not start his mission from the premise that Iraq has
weapons of mass destruction, but rather with "an open mind."</TE>
<TE>   As any reader of detective stories would know, this is a most
curious police method. If you do not have a hypothesis upon which to
work, you are unlikely to find anything.</TE>
<TE>   * His team will operate "in accordance with the established
procedures," meaning the 1998 accords signed by U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan with Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tarik
Aziz.</TE>
<TE>   The accords created what are known in diplomatic circles as "black
tie" or "white gloves" inspections. The reference to "established
procedures" weakens 1441, which was presented as a document
superseding all previous resolutions and memorandums.</TE>
<TE>   * Any evidence that the United States or another United Nations
member presents that Hussein is dissembling cannot even be considered
unless it is verified by Blix's team. Blix already has said he will
not interview Iraqi weapons scientists abroad.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it is wiser," he said, "to interview the Iraqis inside
Iraq and in the presence of a representative of the Iraqi
government."</TE>
<TE>   Even more interesting is Blix's attempt at fudging the concept of
"material breach." He said it was not up to him but to the Security
Council to decide what was a material breach of the resolution. In
other words, the whole thing becomes a matter of opinion, not of
fact.</TE>
<TE>   Blix said his team would focus on 700 sites throughout Iraq. These
are sites that were inspected between 1992 and 1998. Could he not
imagine that the Iraqis might have developed other sites? Wouldn't it
be more prudent to assume that the whole of Iraq could be a weapons
site?</TE>
<TE>   In 1995, Hussein Kamel Majid, Hussein's son-in-law, defected and
told the world of sites that the U.N. inspectors did not know
existed.</TE>
<TE>   Blix's intent can be understood from his assertion that if only
one tire of his automobile is punctured, he will presume that to be
an accident, but if all four tires are flat, he will suspect a
deliberate act of ill will on the part of the Iraqis.</TE>
<TE>   What he has not considered is the way Hussein works. Hussein will
give him one flat tire at a time; enough to keep him busy changing
tires but not enough to induce him to tell the Security Council that
he was deliberately sidetracked.</TE>
<TE>   Will Hussein outfox the gullible "crusaders" once again? He thinks
that he can. It's up to Blix to prove him wrong.</TE>

<LD>The homeland security bill was supposed to protect the United States
from terrorism, but Republican Santas have turned it into a magic
sleigh brimming with early Christmas gifts for favored special
interests.</LD>
<LD>   It's a good thing outgoing Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle
(D-S.D.) and Sen. Joseph I. Lieberman (D-Conn.) are willing to play
Scrooge and hold up the lame-duck congressional session to protest
all the favors that Republican lawmakers smuggled into the bill. When
they vote -- as they probably will today -- lawmakers should support
their effort to strike out the most dangerous or transparently
porkish provisions.</LD>
<LD>   These include an amendment that would permit a Homeland Security
Department to contract with companies that have incorporated offshore
to avoid paying U.S. taxes. And, cramming in a present that sticks
out like a singing telegram, Sen. Phil Gramm (R-Texas) would
guarantee that taxpayers fork over money for a security research
center based at Texas A&amp;M University.</LD>
<TE>   It makes sense for the bill to encourage manufacturers to produce
vaccines. As it now stands, however, its provisions increase
protections for business but reduce them for the public. The bill
contains a special provision that would benefit Eli Lilly and other
manufacturers being sued in state courts for producing a vaccine
preservative that allegedly injured children who received
measles-mumps-rubella vaccinations. Daschle opposes this but
unfortunately would leave untouched a shield protecting smallpox
vaccine manufacturers and health-care facilities from liability for
injuries that result from the vaccine. Its greatest fault is that it
does not create any new mechanism of compensation for potential
victims.</TE>
<TE>   Most troubling is the bill's contempt for the public's right to
open government, as reflected in its restrictions on the Freedom of
Information Act and in its proposal to exempt the proposed
department's advisory committees from the open-meetings requirements
of the Federal Advisory Committee Act. Some meetings of an
anti-terrorist agency would need a special measure of secrecy, but
the bill is far too sweeping.</TE>
<TE>   GOP members may have miscalculated that Democrats, who saw their
party suffer midterm electoral hits for stalling homeland security
legislation over an issue of union rights, would tiptoe away from
Republicans' amendments. Instead, the Democrats are showing some
political spine.</TE>
<TE>   We encourage Republican swing voters in the Senate, including John
McCain (Ariz.) and Lincoln Chafee (R.I.), to do the same. They need
to close their eyes, remember the scenes from September 2001 that
made all this important in the first place and vote to dump their
colleagues' spurious amendments. Homeland security should produce a
good bill, not a bunch of goodies.</TE>

<LD>A disturbing aspect of modern life in this democracy is how many of
us now seem to lazily accept only information favorable to our causes
and favored public figures (or unfavorable to opponents), dismissing
the rest. A vital duty of citizenship is to examine all information.
Thus, the stunning revelations of President Kennedy's serious
lifelong physical infirmities, hospitalizations, obfuscations and the
combined potency of his numerous daily drugs prompt disturbing
questions and encouraging observations.</LD>
<LD>   According to historian Robert Dallek, who got unprecedented access
to Kennedy's medical records and chronicles them in headache-inducing
detail in December's Atlantic magazine, we didn't know that contrary
to his carefully cultivated image of fitness and vitality (remember
the family touch-football photos?), Kennedy was sickly from birth,
was secretly hospitalized often and suffered from osteoporosis,
Addison's disease, colitis and chronic diarrhea. He was in constant
pain, had difficulty on stairs and in chairs and chronically took
steroids, painkillers, antibiotics, antispasmodics, antihistamines,
testosterone and sleeping pills and, briefly, an antipsychotic drug.</LD>
<LD>   Presidential health obfuscation is not unprecedented; unbeknown to
most Americans at the time, President Cleveland had a massive oral
cancer removed and President Wilson was paralyzed by a 1919 stroke.</LD>
<TE>   Because we didn't know of Kennedy's numerous infirmities and
treatments, we couldn't admire his courage and stamina. Nor, by
design, could we ponder the combined and accumulating effect of so
many drugs, some administered without White House medical approval.
The Kennedys feared, with reason, that had voters in 1960 known of
his afflictions, Kennedy would lose what became one of U.S. history's
closest presidential elections. That decision, however, should be up
to the voters, not a close-knit clan of relatives and ambitious
aides.</TE>
<TE>   No one, least of all public figures, likes personal problems
disclosed. But those seeking high elective office forfeit many
things, including much privacy. American voters had and have a right
to the fullest medical information on would-be leaders. And the media
must report it fully and fairly.</TE>
<TE>   To the extent these disturbing revelations feed a modern
predilection to suspect that everyone in public life hides evil
secrets, they're unfortunate. But there are encouraging signs too:
First, the information that some try so hard to hide eventually gets
out. Second, Americans in the last 40 years have displayed evolving
sophistication in judging what matters in candidates.</TE>
<TE>   Once, certain religions and racial backgrounds were disqualifiers
for elective office, as was being female, divorced, gay or disabled.
Once, a previous cancer or a heart condition precluded public
service. Now, we have made great advances both in health care and
thinking. Serious medical conditions still may preclude service, in
the collective judgment of thoughtful citizens. The impressive
development now is that they need not.</TE>

<LD>Venezuela has natural riches in its oil deposits. It has a democratic
constitution and the potential to lift itself. But it is also close
to losing everything in violence.</LD>
<LD>   Pro- and anti-government demonstrators have clashed in the streets
of Caracas, the Venezuelan capital, for the last week. At least one
person has died and dozens have been wounded. Seven months ago, three
days of street violence surrounding a coup attempt may have killed as
many as 60 people. A recurrence of such severe violence is all too
possible, yet both sides can only swap blame. This is the heart of
the problem in Venezuela, a country polarized politically and
socially and faltering economically.</LD>
<LD>   Alarm bells are ringing at the Organization of American States,
and OAS Secretary-General Cesar Gaviria is in Caracas, along with
representatives of the Carter Center in Atlanta and the United
Nations Development Program. Gaviria is looking for ways to
strengthen Venezuela's democracy and disarm civilian groups,
primarily the so-called Bolivarian circles of supporters of President
Hugo Chavez.</LD>
<TE>   The first issue, however, is to get both sides to agree on a date
for a referendum on Chavez's rule. Opponents have gathered more than
2 million signatures calling for an immediate vote on whether Chavez,
a former paratrooper and extreme populist, should stay in office.
Chavez demands a delay until next August. The Venezuelan constitution
allows for such interim elections, and Chavez himself called for one
in 2000, at the height of his popularity, to cement his power.</TE>
<TE>   Venezuela has been in turmoil ever since. The opposition accuses
the president of trying to drag the country toward Cuba-style
communism, a claim made possible by Chavez's fiery speeches and his
close ties with Fidel Castro. Chavez doesn't miss an opportunity to
berate the opposition for "joining coup plotters." Such inflammatory
rhetoric feeds violence and misunderstanding.</TE>
<TE>   Venezuela's economy will contract by 6% this year, according to
private and international bankers, at least partly due to fear of
government incompetence and mistrust of its intentions. Capital
flight will reach $8 billion. The depreciation of the currency, the
bolivar, threatens to fuel inflation to 30% by the end of the year,
more than double last year's rate. Each day of violence harms the
economy more.</TE>
<TE>   Gaviria has called on both sides to exercise restraint. "We can't
allow a repeat of April," he said last week. The attention of
regional and international organizations is a hopeful start.</TE>

<LD>Re "Jewish Defense League's Rubin Is Eulogized by Rabbi as a Hero,"
Nov. 18: I just left Irv Rubin's funeral. I cannot believe that he
has died, but all evidence seems to point that way; it's hard to
dispute, when a coffin has been lowered into its grave and the
community steps forward to lay dirt upon it.</LD>
<LD>   It is amazing to me that while this country is in a state of war
-- a war against terrorism, where all available resources are needed
to fight this insidious element festering among us -- our FBI would
expend its agents to photograph the mourners as they entered the
cemetery. No wonder we are not making any significant strides in this
war.</LD>
<LD>   May God rest Rubin's soul in peace.</LD>

<LD>I wasn't shocked to see the Nov. 16 article, "5 Held in Vandalism of
Freeway Murals" -- after all, graffiti and Los Angeles seem to go
hand in hand. I was, however, angered to read that the taggers had
obtained free paint from a European company after agreeing to
advertise the company's name in the damage these vandals created.
This European company paid for the paint and aided the vandals in
creating this urban destruction. I say Los Angeles should also bill
the same company for the more than $1 million in damage done. Or at
least foot the bill to send the vandals overseas to duplicate the
damage done here.</LD>

<LD>Mike Feuer's Nov. 14 commentary about affordable housing in Los
Angeles argues that the city of L.A. should build, at taxpayer
expense, what he refers to as affordable, multiple-unit housing in
neighborhoods all across town. And if the current residents of these
areas -- living in homes they chose to live in and paid for
themselves -- aren't entirely pleased by this, they "must learn to
say yes." Feuer claims this is necessary because there are so many
overcrowded residences in L.A.</LD>
<LD>   In this country there is something we believe in, and it's called
the free market. The fact is, nobody is guaranteed affordable
housing. It's a simple function of supply and demand or, rather, the
marketplace. If one chooses of his own free will to live in a
cramped, crowded space in order to live in L.A., that's his choice.</LD>
<LD>   There's another idea that Americans have tended to reject soundly,
and that's socialism. And if spending 100 million badly needed
taxpayer dollars (imagine what that could do for schools, cops, etc.)
to essentially give away housing (housing that's being forced into
neighborhoods where it's unwelcome) isn't reminiscent of socialism,
I'm not sure what is.</LD>

<TE>   Los Angeles</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Feuer's commentary stated the dire need for affordable housing in
L.A. and noted the help that a newly passed California bond issue
will be to the cause. On a different page of the same section, we
also read that a proposed addition of 13,000 housing units in Playa
Vista has been reduced to 5,846 units in favor of keeping the area as
a wetland (Nov. 14). This feat was accomplished by an opposing group
that will buy up this land using money from a different, recently
passed California bond issue. Welcome to California!</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>While the chads still litter the polling-place floors, President Bush
has stepped up his antisocial engineering ("Bush Aims to Privatize
Many Federal Jobs," Nov. 15). Still pushing tax cuts that most
benefit the wealthiest 1% as the federal deficit increases, he tries
to control that deficit by hiring scabs to work in governmental jobs
at lower wages. He is, in effect, taxing federal workers to lower the
taxes paid by the rich. Let voters remember that they cast votes not
only for homeland security but also for Republicans.</LD>

<TE>   Kudos to Bush for advocating privatizing many federal jobs. I
suggest we nip the federalization of airport security in the bud and
keep the untrained private security guards and illegal immigrants on
the job.</TE>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Those who claim that this is merely "union-busting" fail to
realize that several of the contracts to be performed will be won by
companies with union employees. But this is really not the issue.
Union employees pay taxes and would dearly love to enjoy an
efficiency-driven tax cut.</TE>
<TE>   Our country is the wealthiest in the world due to its competitive
philosophy. The goal is to receive the best service at the lowest
cost possible. Most of us are sick and tired of our government's
unbridled spending, and this is a wonderful opportunity to put an end
to it. Bush's goal is not to privatize federal jobs but, rather, to
increase efficiency by 30% by allowing the private sector to compete
with the current infrastructure. One has to ask why anyone would
oppose this suggestion.</TE>
<TE>   Dan Scully</TE>
<TE>   Oxnard</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Bush now wants to privatize about half of the federal government
jobs. Given corporate America's extraordinary showing this past year
in terms of maintaining the public trust and forsaking its own profit
motives in the process, Bush now wants to rely on the private sector
to take care of such things as mining safety, federal occupational
safety and many national security functions.</TE>
<TE>   So that Bush won't be subject to charges of hypocrisy similar to
those he faces for attempting, without constitutional authority, to
thrust our nation into war when he himself never fought in one,
perhaps he should begin his privatization campaign by giving up his
own job to the private sector. I, for one, would be happy to do his
job for far less money than he receives, thus making great strides
toward the administration's articulated goal to "reduce costs and
increase the federal bureaucracy's efficiency."</TE>

<LD>What a waste! The Army's Defense Language Institute booted out nine
language trainees merely because they were gay (Nov. 16). Many of
those kicked out were studying Arabic and were doing quite well with
this difficult language at a time when their talents are badly needed
in our interfacing with Arabic peoples, whether they be enemies or
friends.</LD>
<LD>   It's high time Congress got rid of this silly "don't ask, don't
tell" policy. After all, many foreign militaries (including Britain
and Israel) allow gays and have not suffered low morale or "unit
cohesion" problems as a result. These were the phony excuses used by
the military and members of Congress when the policy was forced on
the U.S.</LD>
<LD>   Congress needs to bite the bullet in the face of the "Christian"
Bible-bangers, who still have a stranglehold over far too many of our
lawmakers and policymakers, and put an end to this horrific waste of
manpower. Richard A. Kinz</LD>

ridiculous, but in the light of recent events, it's foolhardy.</TE>

<LD>In "The 'Good Guy' Turns Assassin" (Opinion, Nov. 17), Laura K.
Donohue wrote that the killing of the six Al Qaeda members in Yemen
"was the first time [the Bush administration] has done so outside
Afghanistan; [and] it is the first time it has done so in a country
with which the U.S. is not at war." She rightly says, "We aren't at
war with Yemen. We are at war with a method, which is something much
more amorphous." In fact, the U.S. was never at war with Afghanistan.
Further, the CIA operation was probably conducted with the
cooperation of Yemeni authorities.</LD>
<LD>   Donohue stated, "Congress gave the Bush administration the power
to determine who is a terrorist and to go after him anywhere in the
world." Anywhere, that is, that is beyond the reach of law
enforcement. Marib province, Yemen, is ruled by tribal warlords.
Military action is the only option when the enemy operates beyond the
reach of law enforcement. Law enforcement officials are arresting Al
Qaeda suspects in the Middle East, Europe and Southeast Asia.</LD>
<TE>   The enemy has blurred the line between law enforcement and
military action. Now that the enemy has raised the stakes of
inaction, we are left to act while the academic world debates the
fine points. Donohue's decidedly Western approach is one of our
cultural strengths. The enemy is exploiting that strength as a
weakness. Our failure to recognize this is easily as dangerous as the
power that has been legally granted to the president by Congress.</TE>

<TE>   I do not consider the missile attack on the Al Qaeda operatives in
Yemen assassinations. It was a military strike on a military target.
If our enemies don't wear uniforms, don't mark their vehicles with
insignias and don't have any goal other than martyrdom, the U.S.' war
with terrorists is difficult to prosecute. But it is war.</TE>
<TE>   I applaud Secretary of State Colin Powell's and National Security
Advisor Condoleezza Rice's fortitude in dynamically and quickly
retooling our military and intelligence agencies for fighting a
clandestine enemy within the framework of the Constitution and U.N.
Charter. The CIA has always been an armed agency. And President
Ford's executive order was meant for heads of state, not malicious,
suicidal super-villains. Words like "assassination" and "suspected
terrorist" only serve our enemies' interests, and the memory of Sept.
11 is still much too vivid and horrible to discount their acts as
crimes worthy of due process. The enemy over Pearl Harbor would not
have had such a luxury.</TE>

<DH>For Bruins, Losing Would Be Worst Form of
Counter-Programming</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Close your eyes and you can tell it's USC-UCLA week just by the
sound.</LD>
<LD>   On Bruin Walk in Westwood on Monday, against the background din of
a man expressing his hatred for the Trojans by pounding on a
cardinal-colored car with a sledgehammer, a woman's voice offered,
"SC voodoo dolls, one dollar!"</LD>
<LD>   Inside the J.D. Morgan center the buildup continued.</LD>
<TE>   When UCLA Coach Bob Toledo wasn't calling Saturday's matchup a
"big game," he was calling it a "big, big game."</TE>
<TE>   Then came a noise that was so jarring it sounded like a car
shifting from fourth gear into reverse.</TE>
<TE>   When asked if a win over USC would make this season, Toledo said:
"I don't know if it makes it. I think we've had a pretty good season
already. I think [a victory] just helps to add to it."</TE>
<TE>   ER-AR-GR-CRACHANK!</TE>
<TE>   Wrong, wrong, wrong. Toledo's statement rings true only if the
Bruins want to remain a nice little team. If they expect more -- if
the school and its fans demand more -- then UCLA has to beat USC this
Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   It would be a chance for a UCLA program that was in the national
championship picture at the midpoint of last season to reel in a USC
outfit that has since raced on by.</TE>
<TE>   It would make a statement that mediocrity isn't tolerated. Steve
Lavin was right when he said last week that "you're not allowed to
rebuild at UCLA" for basketball. The same should apply for the
football team. The school offers more than enough to attract
sufficient talent (case in point: Monday's weather) to remain a
fixture in the top 10.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, the Bruins have barely crawled back into the top 25.</TE>
<TE>   They have shaken off a trio of disappointing losses to fashion a
7-3 record, a 4-2 mark in the Pacific 10 and a third-place standing
in the conference. They're proud that they bounced back from a poor
start to position themselves for a bowl game.</TE>
<TE>   Truthfully, there should be disappointment that there isn't more
at stake this weekend. UCLA's 31-30 loss to Oregon on Oct. 12 was bad
enough at the time; it's since been downgraded. Oregon left the Rose
Bowl with a 6-0 record, which meant all of the attention went to some
questionable play-calling by Toledo and a missed 46-yard field goal
by Chris Griffith with 1:54 left to play. Since then the Ducks have
lost four of five, including three at Autzen Stadium, which in
retrospect means we should wonder why the Oregon-UCLA game was that
close in the first place.</TE>
<TE>   And after the Bruins wasted a great defensive effort and two
blocked punts in a 17-12 loss at California on Oct. 19, even Toledo
later viewed that as a game they "maybe should have won anyway"
despite losing their top two quarterbacks to injuries.</TE>
<TE>   So there's no valid reason that this game isn't more important,
that it isn't a showdown for the Rose Bowl. (On the Trojans' end,
their kicking miscues at Washington State are to blame as well.)</TE>
<TE>   Instead, all of the major implications belong to the Trojans. They
still can input their data into the bowl championship series
computers, hit enter and potentially wind up in the Rose or another
BCS bowl.</TE>
<TE>   For UCLA it's not so much about bowl destinations (tough to see
the fans getting worked up about the Holiday, Sun or Insight bowls)
as it is about pride. The seniors, such as tight end Mike Seidman,
don't want to go their entire college careers without a victory over
USC.</TE>
<TE>   The three-game losing streak to their cross-town rival is "a thorn
in my foot," Seidman said.</TE>
<TE>   It seems as if the days when UCLA ran things, winning eight in a
row against USC, are ancient history.</TE>
<TE>   The coaches "don't even bring it up," Seidman said.</TE>
<TE>   But if the Bruins get stuck in too long a stretch going the other
way I'm sure the USC coaches will be talking "streak" all the time
during recruiting visits.</TE>
<TE>   The Trojans are favored to make it four.</TE>
<TE>   Toledo started working on the story line as soon as he sat down.</TE>
<TE>   He called the seventh-ranked Trojans "the best SC team that I've
seen since I've been here at UCLA."</TE>
<TE>   Toledo, in his seventh year as head coach after two years as
offensive coordinator, went as far as saying USC "might be the best
team that we've played since I've been here."</TE>
<TE>   He praised USC's coaching, defense, running backs, Troy Polamalu,
Carson Palmer, even the punter.</TE>
<TE>   So you see the setup: those Bruins will sure try hard against
those big ol' Trojans, but maybe we shouldn't expect too much of
them.</TE>
<TE>   But we know better. We know that there's no such thing as an
underdog when USC and UCLA play. We know it shouldn't matter if
UCLA's senior quarterback, Cory Paus, is still injured. (This is the
moment for unheralded backups to shine, right, John Barnes?)</TE>
<TE>   We know that if seeing USC's uniforms and hearing their fight song
aren't enough to motivate the Bruins, they're also seeking revenge
for last year's 27-0 USC victory that represented the low point of
the Toledo era.</TE>
<TE>   "Getting shut out by SC ... it doesn't get much worse," Seidman
said.</TE>
<TE>   There's that unavoidable buzz on campus. Toledo heard it. He saw
it when he looked out the window and noticed the bear statue was
under protective covering to deter would-be pranksters.</TE>
<TE>   His players can sense it too.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a lot bigger than other weeks," freshman tailback Tyler
Ebell said. "There's a lot more media attention and focus. I see that
it's a big deal."</TE>
<TE>   So big, in fact, that UCLA's season is riding on it.</TE>

<AU>Paul McLeod</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>This season, you can call it the Big wide-open West Conference.</LD>
<LD>   Reigning conference tournament champion UC Santa Barbara and
regular-season co-champions Utah State and UC Irvine earned
postseason bids last season and each again has high expectations. But
Cal Poly San Luis Obispo has several key transfers to go with five
seniors, Cal State Northridge got high marks from opposing coaches in
a preseason poll and Pacific is tough at home in the Spanos Center,
where visitors usually do not shoot well.</LD>
<LD>   Fullerton is off NCAA probation for recruiting violations and
should be improved, Long Beach has a new coach and can beat anyone on
a given night, and Riverside and Idaho, the weakest links, think
they're good enough to pull off a few surprises.</LD>
<TE>   "Last year there wasn't an eyelash of a difference between the
first seven teams," Coach Bob Williams of Santa Barbara said. "And
there's not much difference this year, either."</TE>
<TE>   Utah State Coach Stew Morrill points out that the Big West, which
produced four teams with 20 or more victories last season, has become
more competitive each of the last couple of seasons.</TE>
<TE>   "Three years ago we won the regular season title without a loss
[to a conference opponent]," Morrill said. "Two years ago, Irvine won
it with one loss and we finished second with three losses. Last year,
we shared the title with Irvine and each of us had five losses. I
won't be surprised this year if the winner has more than 4-5 losses."</TE>
<TE>   San Luis Obispo Coach Kevin Bromley and Cal State Northridge Coach
Bobby Braswell agree.</TE>
<TE>   "In conferences like the ACC or SEC, you have one or two teams
you'll never catch and all the others play for position underneath
them," Bromley said. "That's not the way it is here."</TE>
<TE>   Said Braswell: "I don't think the conference champion will be
decided until the last week of the season."</TE>
<TE>   Santa Barbara has six experienced players, but none of them is
taller than 6-7 in a conference loaded with size. The Gauchos, who
lost to Arizona in the first round of last season's NCAA tournament,
are expected to press, drive and launch three-pointers.</TE>
<TE>   Utah State, which lost to Montana State in the opening round of
the NIT last season, has restocked as it always does with junior
college transfers to bolster a lineup that includes three returning
starters.</TE>
<TE>   Irvine, which lost to Brigham Young in the opening round of the
NIT, has some problems at guard but has a deep front line that will
be among the tallest in the nation.</TE>
<TE>   Other wide-open factors in the title chase: Northridge, picked to
finish fourth by Big West coaches, returns three players who were
selected to the conference's all-freshmen team, including freshman of
the year Ian Boylan, a guard.</TE>
<TE>   Long Beach has high hopes under first-year Coach Larry Reynolds,
who built a Division II powerhouse at Cal State San Bernardino. But
injuries and eligibility problems threaten to keep as many as four
49ers off the floor and Reynolds says his new offense has been met
with skepticism from players who liked the freewheeling approach of
former Coach Wayne Morgan, who resigned after six turbulent seasons.</TE>
<TE>   Riverside is redshirting one of the Big West's best players,
forward Vili Morton, so he will have two years of eligibility
remaining when the Highlanders become eligible for postseason play
after moving up from Division II. But Coach John Masi has backed off
the announcement he had earlier this fall that he would also hold
back two other starters.</TE>
<TE>   Then there is Cal State Fullerton, which found every which way to
lose the last two seasons. The Titans shouldn't go quietly once
powerful Senegalese center Pape Sow, a 6-10 junior, recovers from a
sprained ankle. "Playing Fullerton scares everyone," Morrill said.</TE>
<TE>   The Big West could do better in postseason play -- Utah State two
years ago is the only conference team to advance past the first round
of the NCAA tournament -- but with competition within the conference
getting tougher each year that is only a matter of time, coaches say.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Williams, the Santa Barbara coach, says forecasters
might as well flip a coin when it comes to picking a winner this
season. "Who is favored?" he said. "I don't think anybody knows."</TE>

<LD>CAL POLY SAN LUIS OBISPO</LD>
<LD>   Coach: Kevin Bromley.</LD>
<LD>   2001-02 record: 15-12 overall, 9-9 in the Big West.</LD>
<TE>   Top players: Forwards Shane Schilling, a 6-6 junior transfer from
Minnesota, and Diaby Kamara, a 6-7 senior from France who played at
Portland, could be among the top newcomers in the conference. Varney
Dennis, a 6-7 junior forward who averaged 14.7 points and 5.6
rebounds last season, has recurring knee problems and can't practice
every day. Coaches hope 6-1 senior guard Jason Allen, who ranked
sixth in the conference in assists and second on the team in
three-point shooting last season, has a break-out year.</TE>
<TE>   Outlook: The Mustangs could be the sleeper if all the pieces come
together. "This is a very mature group with lots of experience,"
Bromley said. Look for San Luis Obispo to improve when Schilling
becomes eligible Dec. 16. Phil Johnson, a 6-11 center who played in
only 11 games last year because of academic problems, could provide
an additional lift if he remains eligible.</TE>

<TE>   CAL STATE FULLERTON</TE>
<TE>   Coach: Donny Daniels.</TE>
<TE>   2001-02 record: 5-22, 2-16.</TE>
<TE>   Top players: Some scouts think Pape Sow, a 6-10 junior, from
Dakar, Senegal, has a future in the NBA. He averaged 15.5 points and
8.6 rebounds per game last season. His 6-11 cousin, Babacar Camara,
hopes to improve on a disappointing sophomore season in which he
averaged only 4.6 points. Senior guard Brandon Campbell made 40.2% of
his three-point attempts last season.</TE>
<TE>   Outlook: Fullerton is off NCAA probation that previously
restricted contact with junior college players. Sow has been slowed
by an ankle injury, but he figures to be a candidate for conference
player of the year. The Titans probably aren't ready to challenge for
a championship, but they are versatile and should be improved. "We
will play to the level of the opponent's talent," Daniels said.</TE>
<TE>   Schedule: Friday: vs. Texas A&amp;M-Corpus Christi, at Hawaii

<TE>   CAL STATE NORTHRIDGE</TE>
<TE>   Coach: Bobby Braswell.</TE>
<TE>   2001-02 record: 12-16, 11-7.</TE>
<TE>   Top players: Curtis Slaughter, a 6-7 senior swingman, reminds
Braswell of New Jersey Net guard Lucious Harris, who he coached at
Cleveland High and Long Beach State. Lionel Benjamin, a 6-6 senior
forward, led the team in field-goal percentage.</TE>
<TE>   Outlook: The Matadors' explosive offense has been described as
organized street ball but Braswell's gang has the conference
favorites looking over their shoulders. The average margin of loss
for Northridge, which started 1-7 a year ago, was only 1.3 points.
"We're so much farther ahead than we were last year," Braswell said.</TE>

<TE>   Coach: Leonard Perry.</TE>
<TE>   2001-02 record: 9-19, 6-12.</TE>
<TE>   Top players: Senior Justin Logan, a 6-foot guard, started in 27
games last season and is the only returning player. Junior Jack May,
a 6-8 transfer from Southern Idaho, is among four community college
players who should see plenty of playing time.</TE>
<TE>   Outlook: Big West Commissioner Dennis Farrell recently said that a
majority of school presidents want the Big West to become an
all-California conference. Utah State took the hint and is leaving to
join the Sun Belt Conference. It makes sense for the Vandals to get
out too. They've had three coaches and a 40-58 Big West mark since
leaving the Big Sky Conference six seasons ago.</TE>

<TE>   LONG BEACH STATE</TE>
<TE>   Coach: Larry Reynolds.</TE>
<TE>   2001-02 record: 13-17, 9-9.</TE>
<TE>   Top players: Tony Darden, a 6-4 senior guard, averaged 10.1 points
last season. Mark Bowens, a 6-2 sophomore guard, tore a knee ligament
and is out for the season. Lemi Williams, a 6-6 senior forward who
averaged 11.7 points two years ago, missed the 2001-02 season with an
injury and now has a bad back, which will limit his playing time.
Riverside City College transfer Darnell Thompson, fighting for the
starting point guard spot, has academic eligibility problems.</TE>
<TE>   Outlook: Highly successful in five seasons at Division II Cal
State San Bernardino, Reynolds follows Wayne Morgan, who in his six
years as coach turned off alumni by the droves. Reynolds has been
making the rounds glad-handing and is the centerpiece of a cable
television campaign that touts a new image at the Pyramid. His motion
offense, however, will take time to learn, as evidenced by 22
turnovers in a recent 61-53 exhibition loss to his former team.</TE>

<TE>   PACIFIC</TE>
<TE>   Coach: Bob Thomason.</TE>
<TE>   2001-02 record: 20-10, 11-7.</TE>
<TE>   Top players: Senior guard Demetrius Jackson averaged 13.2 points
last season and is the most experienced of five returning players.
Sophomore guard Jasko Korajkic will be out four to six weeks with a
broken hand. Tim Johnson, a 6-11 senior center, is expected to start,
as is Tom Cockle, a 6-5 junior forward who sat out last season, and
David Doubley, an all-state choice who transferred from Skyline
College. Swede Christian Maraker, a 6-9 redshirt freshman, "will be a
star in this league," Thomason said.</TE>
<TE>   Outlook: Even with a soft nonconference schedule the Tigers will
probably start slow, just as they did two seasons ago in advancing to
the Big West tournament final by beating heavy favorite UC Irvine in
a semifinal. "I like the players I have for the next couple of
years," Thomason said.</TE>

<TE>   UC IRVINE</TE>
<TE>   Coach: Pat Douglass.</TE>
<TE>   2001-02 record: 21-11, 13-5.</TE>
<TE>   Top players: Adam Parada, a 7-0 junior center, averaged 12.4
points and seven rebounds last season. Stanislav Zuzak, a 6-10
junior, averaged 8.2 points and 3.8 rebounds. Jordan Harris, a 6-5
senior forward, averaged 12.4 points and 6.8 rebounds, but is coming
off knee surgery. Greg Ethington, a 6-8 sophomore forward, is back
after two years on a Mormon mission.</TE>
<TE>   Outlook: Jerry Green, the two-time conference player of the year,
is playing professionally in Germany, so Irvine will go big with five
players 6-7 or taller. "Our point guard situation is a question
mark," Douglass said. The Anteaters made only three of 22 three-point
attempts in a 63-56 exhibition loss at Cal State Bakersfield.
Nonetheless, look for the Anteaters to win 20-plus games for the
third season in a row.</TE>

<TE>   UC RIVERSIDE</TE>
<TE>   Coach: John Masi.</TE>
<TE>   2001-02 record: 8-18, 5-13.</TE>
<TE>   Top players: Junior forward Vili Morton, who led the Big West in
field-goal percentage (58.6%) and rebounding (9.3) last season came
up with the idea to redshirt himself, Masi said. He'll be back next
year when the team is eligible for postseason play. Play-making
swingman John Galbreath, 6-11 center Klaus Schille and 6-7 forwards
Nate Carter and Aaron Hands have to pick up the slack.</TE>
<TE>   Outlook: There will be times when Masi asks himself why he agreed
with Morton. Then again, this season figures to be just another tough
part of the Division I learning curve.</TE>

<TE>   UC SANTA BARBARA</TE>
<TE>   Coach: Bob Williams.</TE>
<TE>   2001-02 record: 20-11, 11-7.</TE>
<TE>   Top players: Freshman guard Cecil Brown of Canoga Park has
impressed coaches in drills. Swingman Branduinn Fullove, who was
among the best in the conference in five categories on offense last
season, averaged 14.1 points and 4.2 rebounds. Senior Mark Hull, a
6-7 forward who averaged 13.9 points and 4.1 rebounds, is the tallest
starter back. Bray Skultety, a 6-6 senior forward who played in 26
games last season, tore a knee ligament and won't play.</TE>
<TE>   Outlook: The Gauchos, who have plenty of experience, won the
conference tournament with a bigger lineup. This season they will
play small ball with as many as four guards on the floor. "Bigger
doesn't mean better," Williams said.</TE>

<TE>   Coach: Stew Morrill.</TE>
<TE>   2001-02 record: 23-8, 13-5.</TE>
<TE>   Top players: Senior forward Desmond Penigar ranked second in the
conference in scoring (17.2 points) last season. At 6-4, senior
Toraino Johnson should start at small forward. Cardell Butler, a 6-4
redshirt who transferred from Southern Idaho, "can score and
rebound," Morrill said. The Aggies are also counting on Mark Brown, a
transfer from Saddleback College, and Greg Patton, from Canada
College, both guards.</TE>
<TE>   Outlook: The Aggie roster reads like a Who's Who of top junior
college players. It works. In four seasons, Morrill has a 94-33
record. And the Aggies are expected to have their fourth consecutive
season with 20 or more wins.</TE>

<LD>There is crisis public relations. Then there is public relations that
becomes a crisis, worse than the initial problem.</LD>
<LD>   The latter seems to have happened in Augusta, Ga. A seemingly
carefully choreographed PR effort, designed to defuse the issue of
all-male membership at Augusta National Golf Club has done the
opposite.</LD>
<LD>   New Orleans Times-Picayune columnist John DeShazier took issue
with the man in the middle of it all, Augusta National chairman
William (Hootie) Johnson:</LD>
<TE>   "The more Hootie Johnson speaks, the more ludicrous the words
sound. The more he states the case for why Augusta National has no
female members, doesn't have a timetable on accepting a female member
and will likely do so only kicking and screaming, the more legitimacy
he lends to Martha Burks' charge that the club practices sex
discrimination."</TE>
<TE>   Add Hootie: Tim Kawakami of the San Jose Mercury News on Johnson's
making the issue a very public debate: "Excuse me, but where in the
Constitution did the framers say all human rights are inalienable,
unless you have a really good golf tournament? This isn't the Boy
Scouts, though Johnson has argued otherwise. This is one of the
biggest events in golf, on its most famous course, televised by CBS."</TE>
<TE>   Trivia time: What college football team plays in Doyt L. Perry
Stadium?</TE>
<TE>   Blame game: We had to read this quote a couple of times to make
sure it was correct. An athlete, a famous one, was actually taking
the blame after a poor performance.</TE>
<TE>   "Yesterday, I played one of the worst games of my life," Real
Madrid striker Ronaldo told Spanish reporters Monday after a 0-0 tie.
"I made a lot of basic errors and if there was any complaint from the
fans, I deserved it."</TE>
<TE>   Pass the doughnuts: AOL columnist Norman Chad on the complexity of
the bowl championship series rankings:</TE>
<TE>   "In other words, it would be easier to chart Drew Barrymore's
relationship arcs than it would be to dissect the BCS formula. The
first BCS problems here are the human elements -- who can trust
coaches or sportswriters?</TE>
<TE>   "Coaches have built-in biases, plus they don't watch too many
games. Sportswriters also have built-in biases, plus they're
generally eating while watching too many games."</TE>
<TE>   Instant diet: San Francisco Chronicle columnist Scott Ostler on
New Jersey's Chris Childs: "Nets' guard Chris Childs, under
suspension for being too fat, is robbed of $30,000 in jewelry and
cash outside a New York nightclub. Send for Childs' new book, 'Lose
10 Pounds Instantly!' "</TE>
<TE>   Crying game: Illinois Coach Ron Turner, on the officiating after
his team lost to Ohio State, 23-16, in overtime Saturday: "It's a
crying shame for those kids [that] the game was decided by the
officials. Anyone who is against instant replay should walk into that
locker room and see the look in those players' eyes."</TE>
<TE>   Trivia answer: Bowling Green.</TE>
<TE>   And finally: Dallas Star forward Bill Guerin, on the rough early
schedule: "I think we're going to play 20 home games this year. It
feels like that. My kids are calling me Uncle Billy."</TE>

<HD>This Team Is Road Worthy</HD>
<DH>Clippers may be 4-7, but they're 3-3 away from Staples
Center after beating Warriors, 99-89.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Elliott Teaford</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>OAKLAND</DL>
<LD>The Clippers found a game they simply couldn't mess up Monday.</LD>
<LD>   They merely needed to be slightly above average when they faced
the Golden State Warriors, grasping what remained of their sagging
confidence and making the most of their many opportunities for an
easy road victory.</LD>
<LD>   Indeed, the talented but inexperienced (sound familiar?) Warriors
did all they could to ensure the end of the Clippers' three-game
losing streak. Oh, the Clippers did their part, taking full advantage
of all the Warriors had to give en route to a 99-89 victory before
12,196 at the Arena in Oakland.</LD>
<TE>   Michael Olowokandi scored 24 points, including 20 in the second
half, when the Clippers powered away from the Warriors. He also took
12 rebounds. The Clippers led by as much as 82-62 in the fourth
quarter before the game turned into a festival of fouls in the
closing minutes and the Warriors were able to draw closer.</TE>
<TE>   Elton Brand added 17 points and 11 rebounds for his 10th
consecutive double-double. He also had five blocks. Corey Maggette
and Eric Piatkowski added 16 and 14 points, respectively. The
Clippers held the Warriors to 30-for-87 shooting and feasted on
Golden State's 18 turnovers, turning them into 25 points.</TE>
<TE>   Simple. Neat.</TE>
<TE>   So, why don't the Clippers play that way all the time?</TE>
<TE>   The short answer is that the Clippers (4-7) are a better and more
confident team on the road than at Staples Center. They won their
third game in six away from home. They are 1-4 at Staples, and looked
disorganized while giving away a 15-point third-quarter lead in
Sunday's 84-78 loss there to the Seattle SuperSonics.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't have an answer for that," Coach Alvin Gentry said. "It's
all about doing what we need to do, going to our strengths. Michael
was going well, so we tried to keep getting him the ball. Elton came
up with some big plays. It was one of those games that was a total
team effort. Obviously, it was a win we desperately needed."</TE>
<TE>   By the end of the first quarter, the Warriors had more rebounds
(21) than points (17), which said something about their strengths and
weaknesses. Golden State is one of the league's top rebounding teams.</TE>
<TE>   Scoring points and winning games are a different story.</TE>
<TE>   The Clippers aren't a good team at the moment, but the Warriors
are in worse shape. In fact, only the Warriors (3-9) and the Lakers
(3-7) trail the Clippers in the Pacific Division standings.</TE>
<TE>   The Warriors, coming off a 43-point victory Saturday against the
Orlando Magic, scored the game's first two baskets, held leads of 6-1
and 8-7, but the Clippers snapped out of an early funk and slowly
took control.</TE>
<TE>   By halftime, the Clippers had a 52-38 lead, mixing strong shooting
and steady play with the ball with a solid defense to hold off the
sputtering Warriors.</TE>
<TE>   The Clippers led, 73-58, after the third quarter, countering
Golden State's 12-0 run that trimmed a 58-40 deficit to 58-52 midway
through the period with a 15-6 run.</TE>
<TE>   That pretty much sealed the deal.</TE>
<TE>   "We felt this was a game we could get," Brand said. "Now we can
take a day off and relax. We should have won two [including the
Seattle game Sunday], but one is good enough to stop the bleeding.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't care what anybody says, we gave one away at home against
Seattle."</TE>
<TE>   Golden State controlled the backboards, but little else in the
first half. The Warriors made 13 of 43 shots (30.2%), which helped to
explain a deficit that reached 52-37 after Clipper guard Keyon
Dooling's jumper in the closing moments of the second quarter.</TE>
<TE>   Clipper point guard Andre Miller rebounded from four-for-19
shooting in Sunday's loss to the SuperSonics, making wise decisions.
When a shot was available, Miller took it. When it wasn't, he found
an open teammate.</TE>
<TE>   Given the Warriors' mediocre defensive pressure, there always
seemed to be an open Clipper for Miller to find. Miller had four
assists to go with six points in the first half.</TE>
<TE>   He would finish with nine points, eight assists and one loose
tooth, the result of an errant elbow from Golden State's Dean Oliver
in the closing moments.</TE>

<LD>   What: "Keep It Simple"</LD>
<TE>   Author: Terry Bradshaw, with David Fisher</TE>
<TE>   Publisher: Simon &amp; Schuster</TE>
<TE>   Price: $24</TE>
<TE>   On the very first page, even before the table of contents, Terry
Bradshaw announces this book is being dedicated to his therapist and
his pastor. That's the first hint that the book is about more than
simply the life of the four-time Super Bowl-winning quarterback who
has become a successful sports television character, public speaker
and pitchman.</TE>
<TE>   This 246-page hard-cover book focuses on life routes rather than
pass routes, about ways to make one's life simpler -- and better.</TE>
<TE>   It's Bradshaw's fifth book and is an extension of his last, the
2001 New York Times best-seller, "It's Only a Game," which Bradshaw
also wrote with David Fisher. In that book, Bradshaw, using a mix of
down-home style, self-deprecating humor and incredible honesty,
offered lessons in life by revealing his own weaknesses and failures.</TE>
<TE>   He uses the same formula in "Keep It Simple," but goes a few steps
farther. He delves deeper into his three failed marriages and his own
mental demons, among them attention-deficit disorder.</TE>
<TE>   "My life is so messed up, how can I give advice that has any value
to anyone else?" Bradshaw asks.</TE>
<TE>   He then proceeds to pull it off, throwing in plenty of
Bradshaw-type humor along the way. He describes the book this way:
"It's about marriages that fail and how to deal with the pain and
sense of failure. With a few jokes thrown in."</TE>
<TE>   Bradshaw also provides an inside look at being a celebrity. On one
hand, he realizes he has been blessed. But as he points out, nobody's
life is perfect, and certainly not his.</TE>
<TE>   For the sports fan, there's plenty about football and his days
with the Pittsburgh Steelers. But the book is mainly about a man who
has had huge successes in life and has accumulated wealth and fame
but still is struggling to reach the end zone of life and find true
happiness.</TE>

<KH>DUCK REPORT</KH>
<HD>Leclerc, Olausson Are Sidelined</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Chris Foster</AU>
<BD>Time Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>The Mighty Ducks, on a 6-1-1-2 streak, have hit some speed bumps in
their quest to remain a playoff contender. They will be without
forward Mike Leclerc and defenseman Fredrik Olausson for a time.</LD>
<LD>   Leclerc will sit out two weeks after suffering torn cartilage in
his left knee. Olausson will sit out an unspecified time to get
himself into playing shape.</LD>
<LD>   The loss of Leclerc, a power forward who has been one of the
Ducks' best players this season, is a blow to a team that has made
significant improvements. He will have arthroscopic surgery today.</LD>
<TE>   "The only way I can look at it is this is an opportunity to get
better," Coach Mike Babcock said. "Because someone is going to have a
chance to play more. When Adam Oates was injured, [Stanislav] Chistov
got an opportunity and now we'll be better when Adam gets back."</TE>
<TE>   The hole left by Leclerc will be difficult to fill. He has scored
two goals and has 11 points this season. His size, 6 feet 2 and 215
pounds, and his physical style are invaluable to the Ducks.</TE>
<TE>   Neither Leclerc nor Duck officials know how he was injured. After
missing one game because of minor surgery on his right elbow on Nov.
11, Leclerc returned to play two games. His knee became inflamed and
he was sent back to Anaheim on Sunday morning.</TE>
<TE>   Olausson's situation is a bit more vague. He was signed by the
Ducks to beef up the power play, but has no goals and only one assist
in 15 games this season and has been a healthy scratch four of the
last 10 games.</TE>
<TE>   Olausson said that he needs to improve his "base condition,"
something he couldn't do over the summer because of a hip injury. He
was unable to work hard in training camp because of the injury.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   On the brighter side, Oates practiced with the Ducks on Monday,
his first appearance since breaking his left hand against Vancouver
on Oct. 24.</TE>
<TE>   Oates, who has surgical screws in his hand, did little shooting or
passing.</TE>
<TE>   "It was great to get back and get a chance to see the guys," Oates
said. "I still think I am a week to 10 days away from playing. I'm
still at the stage where I'm trying not to do anything to aggravate
it."</TE>

<HD>A New Set of Ground Rules</HD>
<DH>In a sign of times, a snowboarder has taken DiMaggio's
place as coffee maker pitchman</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Alan Abrahamson</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>No longer can there be doubt about where Joe DiMaggio has gone. Dude
has pulled on some gloves, tugged at a warm hat, strapped his feet
onto a snowboard and is now shredding on a powder-laced mountain.</LD>
<LD>   In a sign of the mainstreaming of snowboarding, which only a few
years ago was a sport seemingly restricted to teenage lunatics who
reveled in a buzz-off attitude, Chris Klug, 30, the U.S. snowboarder
who won a bronze medal at the Salt Lake City Winter Olympics,
recently began starring in advertisements for Mr. Coffee.</LD>
<LD>   DiMaggio, the late New York Yankee star idealized in Simon &amp;
Garfunkel's song "Mrs. Robinson" in the 1960s, was for many years Mr.
Coffee's pitchman. Now the torch -- not the Olympic torch, the
iconographic one -- has been passed, from baseball legend ... to
snowboarder.</LD>
<TE>   As Tina Basich, one of snowboarding's most recognizable female
riders, put it, "That's crazy," which is snowboard-speak for
"excellent."</TE>
<TE>   Klug, who survived a liver transplant and is given to keeping
matters in perspective, said, "It's pretty cool."</TE>
<TE>   Other snowboarders have also signed on in recent months for
national ad work.</TE>
<TE>   Observed David Carter, who teaches a class on sports business at
USC and is co-author of a forthcoming book on the subject, "In each
generation, you have athletes who not only transcended their sport
but helped transcend sports and business," stars such as football
quarterback Joe Namath and golfer Jack Nicklaus.</TE>
<TE>   "Snowboarding," Carter said, "has clearly reached that level now."</TE>
<TE>   The Mr. Coffee campaign illustrates how America has changed over
the past few years. For one thing, it is appearing in magazines such
as People and InStyle and online and not, like DiMaggio's
advertisements, on television because, a company official said, the
broadcast landscape is too fragmented today. More significantly, it
illustrates the way America plays, and the players it listens to.</TE>
<TE>   DiMaggio died in 1999, at age 84. In his day, he was -- at least
in public -- the undisputed embodiment of class and grace.</TE>
<TE>   In 1974, 23 years after he retired from baseball, he became
spokesman for Mr. Coffee.</TE>
<TE>   The brand was introduced in 1972 and, with DiMaggio's endorsement,
quickly came to dominate the category it invented -- the automatic
drip coffee maker.</TE>
<TE>   Now roughly one of every three households in the U.S. that has an
automatic drip coffee maker has a Mr. Coffee.</TE>
<TE>   This year Mr. Coffee -- now part of the empire owned by Boca
Raton, Fla.-based Sunbeam Products, Inc. -- turned 30. "The brand
turning the big 3-0, we need to turn and be agile and address
[consumers'] changing needs," said Mary Ann Knaus, vice president and
general manager for global appliances.</TE>
<TE>   The concern: The average Mr. Coffee buyer is between 45 and 55.
The brand wanted to execute a two-fer -- to retain older buyers by
emphasizing what Knaus called Mr. Coffee's "heritage, quality,
all-American feel" even as it attracted more younger buyers,
particularly those 35 to 45, who, as she put it, had "changing
consumption patterns," in essence the choice of a Starbucks on
seemingly every corner.</TE>
<TE>   Like all marketing types, the executives at Sunbeam could read the
numbers that for the past few years have been coming out of the Mt.
Prospect, Ill., headquarters of the National Sporting Goods Assn.:</TE>
<TE>   From 1996 through 2001, for example, participation among boys 7 to
17 in skateboarding jumped 123%, from 3 million to 6.7 million;
participation in snowboarding, which is decidedly more expensive than
skateboarding, nonetheless rose from 1.3 million to 1.9 million boys,
up 46%.</TE>
<TE>   In the same span, golf participation increased 26% from 2.3
million to 2.9 million, football 2% from 4.6 million to 4.7 million.
Baseball participation was flat at 7 million. Basketball dropped 9%
from 9.6 to 8.7 million.</TE>
<TE>   Snowboarding's rise in popularity helped boost the ski industry,
which by the mid-1990s had stagnated. Nationally, snowboarders make
up about half of the people on the slopes on a given day.</TE>
<TE>   Snowboarding's first run in the Olympics came in 1998, in Nagano,
Japan. It was marred when Ross Rebagliati of Canada, the men's slalom
winner, was temporarily stripped of his gold medal after testing
positive for marijuana, which he blamed on second-hand smoke.</TE>
<TE>   He ultimately got to keep the medal but the PR damage lingered --
until this past February at the Salt Lake Games, where everything
went right, particularly for the U.S. team, and snowboarding,
broadcast nationwide on NBC, was stamped with mainstream legitimacy.</TE>
<TE>   First, Kelly Clark of the United States won the women's halfpipe
event. The next day, American men turned a triple play -- Ross
Powers, Danny Kass and Jarret [J.J.] Thomas going 1-2-3 in the men's
halfpipe.</TE>
<TE>   Four days after that, Klug, who had to fix a broken buckle on his
boot with duct tape before his final race, won bronze in the parallel
giant slalom. Any medal, as he and doctors said at the time, was
unlikely; in July 2000, suffering from the same liver disease that
had killed Chicago Bear running back Walter Payton in 1999, Klug
underwent a transplant.</TE>
<TE>   Klug had been on a waiting list for years. He did not receive any
special treatment just because, for instance, he had finished sixth
in the Olympic slalom in Nagano.</TE>
<TE>   Earnest, well-spoken, close to his family, a star quarterback in
high school, he was a marketer's dream. And big business was suddenly
interested in snowboarding.</TE>
<TE>   After the Games, snowboarding could be seen anew as the very
definition of "leading edge," explained Marc Rappin, a senior vice
president at the Foote, Cone &amp; Belding advertising agency in New
York.</TE>
<TE>   But not too leading edge: "Because it's part of the Olympics and
because of the quality of the athletes who participated in the last
Olympics, it is contemporary, leading edge, on the vanguard without
being too far out there and too untouchable for mainstream America,"
Rappin said.</TE>
<TE>   Within weeks after the Games, Powers, Kass and Thomas were signed
to appear in a national TV ad -- the first national TV campaign
featuring Olympic snowboarders -- for a tea company. Which one? As
Powers put it in response to a question in the December issue of
Transworld Snowboarding magazine, "Nestea, dude."</TE>
<TE>   After DiMaggio, Mr. Coffee had its pick of the sports celebrity
endorsers. Why not someone like Green Bay Packer quarterback Brett
Favre, a certain Hall of Famer? Or Lakers Shaquille O'Neal or Kobe
Bryant? Or baseball's Mark McGwire?</TE>
<TE>   Because, according to Rappin, the advertising executive who
supervised execution of the Mr. Coffee campaign, "If we were to use
Mark McGwire, he would just become the newer model of Joe DiMaggio --
not the more innovative model of Joe DiMaggio."</TE>
<TE>   Rick Burton, director of the University of Oregon's Warsaw Sports
Marketing Center, said, "It's like the TV show 'Friends,' where
everybody is permanently 29 years old, where everybody is drinking
coffee and having a fulfilled life.</TE>
<TE>   "Even though they say they're targeting 35 to 45, I think they're
really trying to re-invent themselves and target 15 to 35. That's
where the next demographic bubble is. The baby boomers are dying. The
next generation with disposable income is Generation Y, and the
Generation Y icons and heroes are more likely to be snowboarders and
skateboarders than baseball players."</TE>
<TE>   Klug said the Mr. Coffee campaign -- also featured is MTV's Carson
Daly -- "is so much fun." He added, "I've had so many wonderful
opportunities since the Olympics. It's a great ride."</TE>

<DH>While many laud McNabb, former NFL team doctor questions
wisdom of allowing players so injured on field.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Lance Pugmire</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Donovan McNabb's career-high four touchdown passes on a broken right
fibula drew locker-room descriptions of heroic, tough and
inspirational.</LD>
<LD>   A day later, former NFL team doctor Robert Huizenga chose another:
unfortunate.</LD>
<LD>   "The protocol should be if you have a player in obvious pain like
that, you get him off the field, either immediately or at halftime at
the latest," said Huizenga, who served as the Los Angeles Raiders'
team physician from 1983-90. "It just seems like there should be a
system in place to ensure that. Unfortunately, there isn't one."</LD>
<TE>   McNabb, the Philadelphia Eagles' 25-year-old two-time Pro Bowl
quarterback who signed a $115-million contract extension earlier this
season, suffered the injury when he was sacked by Arizona Cardinals
Adrian Wilson and LeVar Woods on his team's third snap.</TE>
<TE>   With an obvious limp that prevented him from a rushing attempt for
the first time in his four-year career, McNabb threw for 255 yards
Sunday in a 38-14 victory that kept the Eagles (7-3) atop the NFC
East. After saying he "blocked out" the pain and asking a trainer to
tape up his ankle at halftime, McNabb remained in the game until 4:49
remained in the fourth quarter. For the season, McNabb has thrown for
2,289 yards and 17 touchdowns, and has rushed for 460 yards and six
touchdowns.</TE>
<TE>   "[McNabb] didn't want to be bugged on," Eagle Coach Andy Reid
explained Monday. "He was sure that it was a sprained ankle and not
to make a fuss of it, let's just go play. This happens. It happens to
a lot of players that get hurt in this game. You've got to bank a
little bit on what the player says, and Donovan was convinced that he
was fine. That's part of the examination."</TE>
<TE>   After the game, an X-ray revealed the broken bone. McNabb is
expected to miss the rest of the regular season. He's expected to
decide by Wednesday if he'll undergo surgery or have his ankle placed
in a cast.</TE>
<TE>   In other injured quarterback developments Monday, Pittsburgh
Steeler quarterback Tommy Maddox, who sustained concussions to his
brain and spinal cord when he was hit by Tennessee linebacker Keith
Bulluck, was up and walking before being released from a Nashville
hospital. Maddox was admitted to a Pittsburgh hospital Monday night
for more tests and the Steelers expressed optimism that he might
return to play later this season. In Denver, Bronco quarterback Brian
Griese's left knee injury was declared a second-degree sprain of the
medial collateral ligament that will probably sideline him for three
weeks.</TE>
<TE>   Amid the panic in Philadelphia, kick returner Brian Mitchell
assured a WIP radio audience that the team could survive the
quarterback change to Koy Detmer by saying, "When a general is killed
in war, you don't stop fighting," and listeners phoned in to express
despair about the Eagles' Super Bowl chances if the future brings a
playoff game in Green Bay, where Packer quarterback Brett Favre is
32-0 in games when the thermometer reads 34 degrees or cooler.</TE>
<TE>   Yet Huizenga pointed to a concern in the NFL he said is far more
reaching. "Where is the common sense?" he asked. "Pain is fine, if
the player is moving well. McNabb wasn't moving well enough to defend
himself. He's lucky he didn't suffer a disabling injury. Where were
the people who are supposed to have the players' best health
interests, the coaches and the doctors? I hope this will be a call to
common sense, but I've seen so many cases like this swept under the
rug and I see no reason why it won't happen again."</TE>
<TE>   Warren Anderson, an Arizona-based personal trainer of McNabb, said
the quarterback's performance was admirable -- and fits with his
strong-willed pattern of returning from a left knee sprain as a
rookie to play in a meaningless season-finale and playing through an
on-field vomiting episode Oct. 6 at Jacksonville.</TE>
<TE>   "He's as tough as they come, he was gutting it out," Anderson
said. "When you play with a guy like that, you appreciate that
attitude of laying it on the line. I'm sure if it was up to him, he'd
play again this week."</TE>

<LD>These people live among you:</LD>
<LD>   Jeff Simpson: "Your spoiled child tantrums committed to print
cheapen the efforts of those considered professionals at The Times. I
will never subscribe to The Times or patronize its online version as
long as you are employed by the newspaper. You may think ... 'it's
just one jerk SC fan,' but trust me ... there are thousands like me."</LD>
<LD>   I have no doubt about that.</LD>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Dennis McD1.: "Face it, T.J. you are an idiot. It will only hurt
your career if you continue being an obnoxious jerk to [USC fans]. I
had an uncle pass away recently. He wasn't very nice to people while
he lived and when he died only 12 people showed up for his funeral
[two of them were altar boys]. The same thing will happen to [you] if
[you] continue down this path."</TE>
<TE>   If the idea is to rest in peace why would anyone want a bunch of
USC fans at his funeral?</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Resume2002: "You must be a very sad and lonely man."</TE>
<TE>   On the contrary, I have tons of UCLA friends.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Bill Miller: "I can't understand why no one has complained about
how critical you are of 'Around the Horn.' Can you explain this?"</TE>
<TE>   No one watches.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Todd Burnett: "Please leave, and save all of us Trojans and proud
Angelenos from your venomous filth. Are you really this ignorant? Or
are you just a simple-minded bad writer?"</TE>
<TE>   Frankly, you've got me stumped.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   CARI4USC: "I'd like to suggest you go to hell, but no, Heaven is
better because at least there you will be surrounded by Trojan fans."</TE>
<TE>   Someone has to wait hand and foot on all the Irish fans up there.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Jason Wolak: "After reading your article Sunday it's obvious to me
you never played football and don't understand what the USC football
team has accomplished. Had you ever had the guts to strap a helmet
on, I'd have loved to have had the chance to lay a smashing hit on
you."</TE>
<TE>   Sounds as if you've played some football with the helmet off.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   David Chill: "After 25 years of receiving the service, I canceled
my Times subscription today. Your column regarding USC [Sunday] was
the last straw."</TE>
<TE>   I know how hard it is to turn from page two without reading it ...</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Kathy Schwartz: "Regarding the mention [in your column] about the
Notre Dame High School band not being able to play for the University
of Notre Dame at the USC game: The band members are all extremely
disappointed. Especially, Lyle, the Tuba player."</TE>
<TE>   Good news, USC is inviting the band to the game; no idea if
they'll be forced to play Conquest.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Gregg Shanberg: " ... Plaschke is on the bandwagon and I'm sure
your big fat behind will be on there, too, by season's end."</TE>
<TE>   Obviously you have me confused with sports editor Bill Dwyre.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   N. Chris Lynch: "I'm gonna call your boss and ask that he fire
you. I'm going to take action against your paper by asking everyone I
know to cancel. I'm also going to request that your paper be banned
from all USC functions unless you are fired."</TE>
<TE>   Does that include not speaking to Trojan Booster Clubs?</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Mcatlin: "You have shown your ignorance of the sport of tennis --
especially women's tennis. Why would you ask a player why she wears a
watch? Either stay away from reporting on women's tennis or become
more informed. You owe Ms. [Justine] Henin and women's tennis an
apology."</TE>
<TE>   It's Mrs. -- Henin got married over the weekend. You should be
better informed.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Dale Red: "You have to give the USC Brain Surgeons [the late Jim
Healy's term] one thing, year after year they have better looking
cheerleaders than the Bruins. Why is that?"</TE>
<TE>   I'm not going there, although I believe you have it the other way
around.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Leafnose: "The Coliseum is beyond tired. I was there for [the USC
game]. It was my first attendance at a game in over 15 years ...
there's an enormous number of fans who don't attend USC games based
on the facility and the perceived nuisances in the stands. My base
reason for not going to the Coliseum -- it stinks. I couldn't see a
thing."</TE>
<TE>   Wait until Saturday's Smoke Out Festival on the Coliseum grounds.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Jack Moore: "Where is your support for a local player? Be he Bruin
or Trojan or whatever? Whether you like USC or not, the statistics
put up by Carson Palmer this year against what is considered the
toughest schedule in the nation deserves your unbiased scrutiny."</TE>
<TE>   First you want my support for a local player, and then you demand
my unbiased scrutiny.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Christine Hanson: "Bill Plaschke gave you reason after reason why
Carson Palmer is more deserving than any other collegiate player this
season to be awarded the Heisman."</TE>
<TE>   I thought it was just one of those down-and-out Plaschke columns
about some guy who can't catch a break ...</TE>
<TE>   (Page Two unbiased scrutiny update: Palmer, who has yet to carry
the Trojans on his back to victory, lacks the credentials to be
ranked in the top five for Heisman consideration, falling behind
Miami's Ken Dorsey and Willis McGahee, Texas Tech's Kliff Kingsbury,
Iowa's Brad Banks, Colorado's Chris Brown, Washington State's Jason
Gesser and Penn State's Larry Johnson.)</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Jon Albin: "You're pathetic. I was thinking maybe you couldn't
gain admission to USC. But it seems you are bitter about all L.A.
sports. Maybe you were just the fat kid that was always picked last
at recess and you're trying to work out some issues. Either way,
you're a joke."</TE>
<TE>   Well, that'll help me work out my issues.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Lance Israel: "Being so bitter causes health problems."</TE>
<TE>   I'm checking to see if there's a vaccine for Trojan fans.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Mdubop: "Hey there Old Toe-Jam Simers, you must be getting scared
that you'll be run out of town on a rail some day ... "</TE>
<TE>   I'm more concerned there's going to be a reason to cover a USC
women's basketball game this season.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Kenneth Hofman: "You have got to get a life. Your life's ambition
is to somehow discredit USC and its football program? Wow. Falls just
a bit short of world peace, my brother."</TE>
<TE>   I'm just glad you took time out from your work on world peace to
e-mail me.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Rick Cort: "I've been going to SC football games for 40 years ...

<HD>Hogging the Spotlight</HD>
<DH>Precocious freshmen have taken front-and-center roles in
UCLA's surprising success this season, with leading rusher Ebell and
leading tackler Havner the most prominent examples.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Steve Henson</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>

<LD>Young men are fitter to invent than to judge, fitter for execution
than for counsel, and fitter for new projects than for settled
business.</LD>
<LD>   -- Sir Francis Bacon</LD>
<LD>   *</LD>
<TE>   It's no slam on Jack Ham, Floyd "Pork Chop" Womack or the Hogs who
blocked for the Washington Redskins to suppose that Bacon knew his
pigskin.</TE>
<TE>   The esteemed English philosopher, essayist and statesman was born
several centuries before the invention of football, but many of his
most memorable quotations describe the current group of UCLA freshmen
in uncanny fashion.</TE>
<TE>   From tailback Tyler Ebell to linebacker Spencer Havner to
quarterbacks Drew Olson and Matt Moore, blue and gold greenhorns are
reinventing the Bruin season, skillfully executing plays and learning
on the fly.</TE>
<TE>   Fitter than their foes? More often than not.</TE>
<TE>   With 22 freshmen and redshirt freshmen contributing, UCLA is a
surprising 7-3 and has won its last three games.</TE>
<TE>   Dismiss it as youthful naivete, but the Bruins will start their
rivalry game against USC Saturday believing they can capture a city's
heart, gain a Rose Bowl berth and establish superiority for the
foreseeable future.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   A man that is young in years may be old in hours, if he have lost
no time.</TE>
<TE>   -- Bacon</TE>
<TE>   Or, as Ebell put it 400 years later, "It's cool so many of us are
getting to play right now. It'll make us better a lot sooner."</TE>
<TE>   The tailback is doing his part, taking the ball and running with
it. He has had six consecutive 100-yard rushing games.</TE>
<TE>   Havner, a turnover-causing tornado and the team's leading tackler,
is another freshman making a high-profile contribution.</TE>
<TE>   Olson and Moore, too, are in the spotlight, having led the Bruins
to three victories since the injury to senior quarterback Cory Paus.
Neither has thrown an interception and both exhibit poise beyond
their years.</TE>
<TE>   But the depth chart yields a veritable fountain of youth, a steady
spigot of first-year players making an impact.</TE>
<TE>   Mike McCloskey became the starting center in fall camp and coaches
rave about his quickness, intelligence and rapid improvement.</TE>
<TE>   Jarrad Page turned down a lucrative pro baseball contract and won
the job at strong safety, solidifying a secondary that has allowed
opposing quarterbacks to complete only 47.9% of their passes.</TE>
<TE>   J.D. Groves and Keith Carter shared the load at fullback when an
injury kept sophomore Manuel White sidelined for four games. Both are
excellent blockers, and Carter -- grandson of NFL Hall of Famer Gino
Marchetti -- can also play tight end.</TE>
<TE>   Marcedes Lewis and Junior Taylor are explosive receivers whose
playing time is restricted because veterans Craig Bragg, Tab Perry
and Mike Seidman are having strong seasons. Lewis, a 6-foot-6 tight
end, is a formidable blocker and creates mismatches when he lines up
at wide receiver. Taylor has five catches and is averaging 25.8 yards
in four carries on reverses and trick plays.</TE>
<TE>   Jason Harrison and Wendell Mathis began fall camp ahead of Ebell
at tailback. Harrison is an excellent receiver with the versatility
to play fullback. Mathis, coaches say, will shine, given an
opportunity.</TE>
<TE>   More than a dozen freshmen have made impacts on special teams,
most notably cornerback Glen Ohaeri and linebackers Justin London and
Wesley Walker.</TE>
<TE>   "I would have to say that because so many have contributed, this
is the best freshman group since I've been here," Coach Bob Toledo
said.</TE>
<TE>   Yes, it appears that while Bruin fans were fumbling for the eject
button on Toledo's hot seat, the program found a future.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The good things which belong to prosperity are to be wished, but
the good things that belong to adversity are to be admired.</TE>
<TE>   -- Bacon</TE>
<TE>   Ebell, Havner, Carter and McCloskey are among the freshmen who
red-shirted last season. They toiled on the scout team, getting
pummeled in practice. Off the field, they were mostly ignored by a
glittering group of seniors with NFL aspirations.</TE>
<TE>   The Bruins won their first six games, then splintered, losing four
in a row. Those who were redshirts took note.</TE>
<TE>   "I remember thinking that when my time came, I would not be part
of a team that let that happen," Havner said.</TE>
<TE>   Senior tailback DeShaun Foster was suspended for the last three
games last season because he broke NCAA rules by driving a car that
did not belong to him. That made a stronger impression than any
lecture from a coach on the vagaries of the rule book.</TE>
<TE>   "The season went down the drain," Havner said. "When DeShaun was
suspended, it took the heart out of almost everybody. He was the
heart and soul of the team. He brought the swagger."</TE>
<TE>   A year later, it's the freshmen who are strutting their stuff.
Ebell scored three touchdowns against Washington, and Havner returned
an interception 41 yards for a touchdown, pointing his finger in the
air before he reached the goal line.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The invention of young men is more lively than that of old, and
imaginations stream into their minds better, and as it were, more
divinely.</TE>
<TE>   -- Bacon</TE>
<TE>   They live the moment each Saturday, walloping opponents supposedly
older and wiser. Only on Monday do the freshmen allow themselves to
look ahead.</TE>
<TE>   "We get together and dream big dreams," Taylor said. "I hate to
look into the future, but with every coming year, we will be better
and better. And some of these guys are pretty good right now."</TE>
<TE>   Youthful indiscretions have been remarkably rare. The only
turnover committed by a freshman has been a bungled center snap from
McCloskey to Moore.</TE>
<TE>   "I can't believe how good we can be," Harrison said. "It wasn't
until the last couple of weeks that I could fully appreciate all the
talent."</TE>
<TE>   Ten games into the season, many of them no longer feel like
freshmen.</TE>
<TE>   "So many of us are playing right now, getting experience, we could
have 40-50 games under our belts in our careers," Havner said.</TE>
<TE>   Fresh challenges await. Facing USC, for starters. And turning the
tables. Bruins who were redshirts last season watched in disgust as
teammates they regarded as mentors were pummeled by the Trojans,
27-0.</TE>
<TE>   And USC is much improved, a veteran team ranked No. 7 and focused
on winning a Pac-10 championship. The Trojans will start 10 seniors
and eight juniors Saturday. Their only freshman starter is tackle
Winston Justice, although leading receiver Mike Williams plays
extensively.</TE>
<TE>   Age and cunning very well could overcome youth and exuberance. It
often does, and that's a big reason USC is favored.</TE>
<TE>   Should the Bruins falter, the words of another eminently quotable
Briton might temper the disappointment, reminding the freshmen that
another day will dawn:</TE>
<TE>   For God's sake, give me the young man who has brains enough to
make a fool of himself.</TE>

<HD>Annies Hoping to Draw Some of Oscar's Attention</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Patricia Ward Biederman</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>By better synchronizing animation's top prizes with the Academy
Awards, the animation industry hopes some of Oscar's luster will
shine on Annie.</LD>
<LD>   The presentation of the awards -- the animation industry's answer
to the Oscars -- will move from its traditional November date to Feb.
1 at Glendale's Alex Theatre, a change that organizers hope will make
the Annies a more closely watched prelude to the Oscars.</LD>
<LD>   Founded 30 years ago by legendary voice actor June Foray, the
voice of Rocky the Flying Squirrel, the Annies have grown in stature
as animation has matured and diversified beyond Disney. Animators
value the awards because they represent the judgment of their peers
in ASIFA-Hollywood, the Southern California branch of the
international animation society, which was founded in France in 1957.</LD>
<TE>   By putting eligibility for the Annies on the same calendar-year
cycle as the Academy Awards and rescheduling their presentation,
ASIFA-Hollywood hopes to make its ceremony part of an entertainment
awards season that includes the Golden Globes in January and the
Oscars in March, said Antran Manoogian, longtime president of the
Burbank-based ASIFA-Hollywood.</TE>
<TE>   Previously, Annies honored animated work released between Aug. 1
of the previous year and July 31 of the year of the ceremony,
Manoogian said. Under the new schedule, Annie consideration will be
given to work released in the calendar year before the ceremony --
mimicking the Jan. 1-Dec. 31 eligibility system for the Oscars.</TE>
<TE>   In March, the Motion Picture Academy awarded its first Oscar for
best animated feature to DreamWorks' "Shrek," which also was the big
winner at the 2001 Annies.</TE>
<TE>   Under the new scheme, animated works released between Aug. 1,
2001, and Dec. 31, 2002, will be eligible for the next Annies.
Nominations in more than 20 categories will be announced Jan. 6.</TE>
<TE>   "We will announce our nominees before the Academy Awards, and we
will announce our winners before the Academy Awards," Manoogian said.</TE>
<TE>   Animation Guild President Kevin Koch sees the change as positive.
"It does position the Annies to become an award that potentially
leads into the Oscars," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Koch's one concern is that this season's unique 18-month
eligibility period might cause some first-rate animated features to
get lost in the shuffle. "The unfortunate thing is that they're
making a change during an especially strong year for animated
features," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "Next year [when only a year's worth of films will be eligible],
it'll be fine, but this is kind of a crazy year because you're taking
18 months worth of films, and it's been a good 18 months."</TE>
<TE>   A raft of animated features, including several hits, will be
eligible for February's Annies. Possible contenders include "Monsters
Inc.," "The Ice Age," "Jimmy Neutron: Boy Genius," "Stuart Little 2,"
"Spirit: Wild Stallion of the Cimarron," "Metropolis," "Lilo &amp;
Stitch," "Treasure Planet," "The Wild Thornberries Movie," "Eight
Crazy Nights," and "Spirited Away."</TE>

<HD>Animation Center Vision Gets Glendale's Support</HD>
<DH>Group has six months to plan how to transform a former bank
into a home for cartoon lore.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Patricia Ward Biederman</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>If local animation aficionados have their way, Bugs Bunny, Mickey
Mouse, Scooby Doo, Shrek and other toons and their creators will one
day have an animation center, with museum, in Glendale.</LD>
<LD>   "There's no real animation museum in the country," said Eve
Rappoport of the Glendale Arts and Culture Commission.</LD>
<LD>   "And Glendale has this history of being home to several animation
studios -- both the big boys and smaller shops -- and a lot of
animators. This makes sense for Glendale."</LD>
<TE>   Supporters of the idea saw progress last week when the city's
Redevelopment Agency gave Animation Initiative Glendale the go-ahead
to develop a plan for turning the former Fidelity Federal Savings and
Loan building on Broadway into an animation center. Besides a museum,
the facility would include a gallery, library and archive, screening
room, lecture hall, classrooms and office space.</TE>
<TE>   Glendale, where both DreamWorks' animation campus and Disney
Imagineering are based, has also been the home of Disney animation at
various times in the past.</TE>
<TE>   Frank Gladstone, an organizer of the initiative and a DreamWorks
SKG employee, said that he and other animation professionals and
enthusiasts have been talking about the project for about a year.
"The common consensus was that we had to have some grounding, some
sort of sticking place -- what it came down to was we needed bricks
and mortar."</TE>
<TE>   Glendale had the requisite bricks and mortar in the form of a
landmark bank building that the city bought for $1.3 million in 2001.
Eight other organizations were in contention for the property,
including an Extended Stay America and a real-estate developer who
proposed constructing 70 housing units on the site.</TE>
<TE>   Besides the center, the plan by Gladstone's group would include an
animation store or other retail operation and a restaurant/coffee
shop, which could be money-makers for the facility.</TE>
<TE>   According to the proposal, the center could develop programs with
local public schools as well as CalArts and other Southern California
colleges and universities. Professional education and retraining
could be offered at the center through the Animation Guild, and other
animation-support organizations could use the building. It would also
be a place for animators to hang out, Rappoport said.</TE>
<TE>   Most recently used as office space, the bank was designed in the
mid-1950s by architect W. A. Sarmiento, who was influenced by
Brazilian architecture. The once innovative 65,000-square-foot
building is structurally sound, but now needs new wiring, ramps and
facilities for the disabled.</TE>
<TE>   Glendale has given the Animation Initiative six months to come up
with an architectural plan for the building, as well as a business
plan and timeline for raising the estimated $3 million to $4 million
the center is expected to cost. The city has also asked to see a
financial plan for operating the center once it is built, Gladstone
said.</TE>
<TE>   The group will need $80,000 to $100,000 to complete the initial
plans, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Rappoport is enthusiastic about the project, which she thinks
could serve both the animation community and the city as a whole.</TE>
<TE>   "Animation is an important industry in Glendale and this would
celebrate it," she said. The center could also "bring people to
Glendale and put it on the cultural tourism map."</TE>
<TE>   Jeanne Armstrong, Glendale's director of development, said the
city has talked about an animation-related facility for years. She
said it could be a good complement to existing facilities. "We've got
wonderful office space and great retail, but we don't have many
visitor attractions," she said.</TE>
<TE>   "The city was very firm that we don't have money to contribute [to
the center] beyond the building," Armstrong said. "The cost of any
construction and the cost of ongoing operations would have to be
borne by the initiative."</TE>
<TE>   Four members of the development agency endorsed the plan, and one
opposed it.</TE>

<HD>O.C. High School's Chinese Class Presents a Great Wall to
Conquer</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Claire Luna</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The students' surf shorts and freckled faces, a Mexican flag draped
on one wall and Spanish-language workbooks spilling off the shelves
-- to all appearances, it's a typical high school foreign-language
classroom in suburban south Orange County.</LD>
<LD>   Their conversation, however, is anything but predictable: Ni hao?
Ni, chi fan le, mei yu? Wo bu dong.</LD>
<LD>   These sophomores at Rancho Santa Margarita's Tesoro High --
roughly 20 boys and a couple of testosterone-tolerant girls -- in
advanced Chinese III actually began studying the language five years
ago, in fifth grade, with the same teacher, Steve Cook.</LD>
<TE>   Chinese is more often taught in areas with large Asian
populations, such as San Francisco and the San Gabriel Valley, and
often by native speakers to children who have at least some
familiarity with the language.</TE>
<TE>   Cook, by contrast, learned Chinese as a Mormon missionary when he
was in his 20s. His challenge is to teach a language that neither he
nor his students grew up speaking, and one they cannot yet use much
outside class.</TE>
<TE>   To that end, Cook has engaged his students over the years with
activities that emphasize culture over rote memorization -- Chinese
chess tournaments in the classroom, scavenger hunts in Chinatown, a
monthlong field trip to China.</TE>
<TE>   With college not far off for his oldest students, Cook knows time
is running out to ensure that Chinese captivates them to the point
they won't abandon it.</TE>
<TE>   "High school is not enough time to become fluent in any language,
much less one they can't practice outside class," Cook said. "My job
is to get them fascinated enough so they pursue it in college and
afterward on their own."</TE>
<TE>   Brian Clyne agreed with most of his classmates that no matter how
great his aspiration to learn an unusual foreign language, if it
weren't for Cook's creativity he would have dropped it years ago.</TE>
<TE>   "We see this as really fun, but definitely a lifetime commitment,"
said Brian, toting an oversized costume head of a laughing monk to
the teacher's minivan.</TE>
<TE>   "Even if we wanted to now, I don't think any of us can imagine
abandoning Chinese after we've already invested all this time."</TE>
<TE>   Brian and others in the class have continued taking Chinese even
after exhausting the district's language requirement and despite
having to pass up surfing class, which meets at the same time.</TE>
<TE>   Why? To give themselves a leg up in college admissions and the job
market, they said.</TE>
<TE>   "My parents were really surprised when I was the one to push
staying with Chinese, rather than the other way around," Brian said.
"But you need something to set you apart from your peers in this
world."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   In a Tiny Minority</TE>
<TE>   Cook's students are among some 1,900 in 35 California high schools
enrolled in advanced Chinese-language classes, according to the state
Department of Education. In contrast, there are about 93,000 students
at 850 high schools taking the same level of Spanish instruction.</TE>
<TE>   Teachers throughout the U.S. are hard-pressed to produce students
who can function in multiple languages of even the traditional types.
In a nation where foreign-language classes are viewed in the same
light as band or auto shop -- options rather than necessities --
experts in the field say an overhaul in the way they are taught is
needed.</TE>
<TE>   Language classes should begin earlier and be cast as teaching
lifelong skills rather than academic subjects, said J. David Edwards,
director of the Joint National Committee on Languages, a coalition of
60 language teaching groups.</TE>
<TE>   "We'll be seeing this deficiency in our students as long as we
treat foreign languages as an elective instead of a required course
started in elementary school," he said.</TE>
<TE>   In Capistrano Unified, which oversees Tesoro High, a federal grant
that had subsidized the district's Chinese-language program will end
after this year. District officials said they are committed to
continuing the program, which now covers kindergarten through fourth
grade.</TE>
<TE>   Often, school districts don't have the money to maintain language
programs launched with external funding, so the programs end when the
money does.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   'A Global Society'</TE>
<TE>   "We have a lot of board members that feel strongly that in order
to be citizens in a global society we really need to be bilingual,"
said Susan McGill, Capistrano's executive director of elementary
operation services. "Although we would love to be able to expand
language programs to all of the elementary schools, we know that
we're lucky just to be able to continue what we have."</TE>
<TE>   For a program whose earliest students are now sophomores, the
challenges are still numerous for Cook.</TE>
<TE>   He is limited by circumstance: Because he also teaches
middle-school students and Tesoro's freshmen, he has to shuttle
around South County with whatever classroom materials he can fit in
two canvas bags.</TE>
<TE>   Also straining Cook is the challenge for a nonnative speaker to
teach a language with complex grammar and pronunciation rules he
doesn't fully understand.</TE>
<TE>   The issue came up recently when Jammie Peng, one of two students
with enough Chinese-language background to transfer to the advanced
class, was frustrated when he couldn't tell her the meaning of a
character on a bag of Chinese candy.</TE>
<TE>   "You're Chinese; if you don't know, how should I?" Cook asked,
laughing.</TE>
<TE>   His Chinese III students can recognize about 100 characters and
write about three dozen, a showing that Cook acknowledges is "dismal"
compared with the few hundred that most students in other schools'
same-level classes can write.</TE>
<TE>   As in the lower-level classes, Cook concentrates heavily in
Chinese III on culture, history and lifestyle with videos, games and
field trips.</TE>
<TE>   Although Cook acknowledges that those lessons consume time that
could be devoted to more concrete language instruction, he says
learning about lifestyle in conjunction with grammar and vocabulary
is needed to maintain the students' interest through high school and
beyond.</TE>
<TE>   Those less academic activities are integral to learning Chinese in
a way that actually proves helpful when talking with others in the
language, Tesoro sophomore Chris Finical said.</TE>
<TE>   While in China last summer, the students simultaneously practiced
their Chinese and participated in park tournaments. They could
communicate with people on a personal level because their classes
covered current events, Chris said.</TE>

<HD>Masry Says Quality of Life Is New Council's Priority</HD>
<DH>The Thousand Oaks mayor vows to continue pushing a
slow-growth agenda and fighting the proposed Ahmanson Ranch
development.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Gregory W. Griggs</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As he winds down his term as Thousand Oaks mayor, Ed Masry on Monday
vowed that the new City Council will step up its fight against
Ahmanson Ranch, limit municipal spending, curb excessive residential
and commercial development and strive to maintain the city's enviable
quality of life.</LD>
<LD>   "We are entering a new era in Thousand Oaks," Masry said. "We have
a City Council that is going to place the environment, neighborhoods
and existing businesses first."</LD>
<LD>   Referring to the Nov. 5 election, in which two anti-development
candidates won seats, Masry said the new slow-growth council would
join Los Angeles and Calabasas in fighting developer Washington
Mutual's plans to "destroy thousands of acres of oak-studded rolling
hills" to build a 3,050-home mini-city on the eastern edge of Ventura
County.</LD>
<TE>   Residents of Thousand Oaks would be affected, he said, by an
estimated 45,000 daily car trips that Ahmanson Ranch would "add to
the already overcrowded Ventura Freeway and connector roads," and
their health would be jeopardized by "840 tons of new air pollution
each year."</TE>
<TE>   His comments came during a state of the city address before more
than 220 people at a lunch sponsored by the Thousand Oaks-Westlake
Village Regional Chamber of Commerce.</TE>
<TE>   The council, which next month adds Masry-backed restaurateur Bob
Wilson Sr. and television producer Claudia Bill-de la Pena, is ready
to help the city deal with the fallout of a $21-billion state budget
deficit, said Masry, an attorney.</TE>
<TE>   "Our new council is not only a slow-growth council, it also has
council members who understand, on a first-hand basis, what it means
to meet a regular payroll," he said. "The coming year will be hard on
local governments. We need to be more careful in the way that we
spend our money."</TE>
<TE>   Masry said that Thousand Oaks has become a regional center for
high-technology and biomedical employment and that more jobs are
being added, but he disagrees with those who believe the solution for
accommodating those workers is to build more homes.</TE>
<TE>   "The market of housing, affordable and unaffordable, is
demand-driven, not supply-driven," he said. "You're never going to
build enough houses to shelter all the people who want to live here."</TE>
<TE>   Calling the city "an exceptional place to live and work," Masry
reviewed the highlights of the past year: Baxter Bioscience, J.D.
Power and other companies relocated to Thousand Oaks; the city
collected a record $24 million in sales tax revenue; four
neighborhood shopping centers made substantial property upgrades; and
several community facilities opened, including Gardens of the World;
the Hillcrest Center, which houses the arts council and a National
Parks Service office; and Los Robles Banquet Center, where Masry
delivered Monday's speech.</TE>
<TE>   Mayor Pro Tem Andy Fox, the top vote-getter in the recent
election, attended the lunch. He has long been an opponent of
Ahmanson Ranch, he said afterward, and thinks a 10-year-old traffic
study in the project's environmental impact report is insufficient.
Fox said the council should adhere to Thousand Oaks' long-standing
General Plan in regard to future housing.</TE>

<LD>After cutting crime in half over the last decade, Oxnard officials
hope to make their city even safer by hiring eight more police
officers as part of a five-year plan to beef up law enforcement.</LD>
<LD>   At tonight's City Council meeting, City Manager Edmund Sotelo will
request that about $700,000 be set aside in next year's budget to
increase the number of uniformed officers to 217.</LD>
<LD>   Officials said the new forces are needed to meet the demands of a
fast-growing city.</LD>
<TE>   "If you compare us to some other cities in Ventura County, we're
handling double the number of calls," said Assistant Police Chief
John Crombach. "So, yes, we need additional resources."</TE>
<TE>   Officials said they cannot say for sure how many officers would be
hired by the end of five years.</TE>
<TE>   "We're still working on the master plan," Sotelo said. "Every year
is different, and it's impossible to tell how many officers" will
eventually be added.</TE>
<TE>   Sotelo said his request is not related to recent gang violence. He
said officials have been planning to augment the police force for
years but had to wait until the city had the money.</TE>
<TE>   The new hiring would come about six years after the City Council
committed $3.5 million annually to hire 31 more officers despite a
declining budget.</TE>
<TE>   Sotelo said he is reviewing all city services, but officials said
a top priority is public safety.</TE>
<TE>   "I think in terms of our residents as a whole, public safety
usually is in the forefront of people's minds," said Assistant City
Manager Karen Burnham.</TE>
<TE>   City officials said money to hire the officers would come from a
$25-million city reserve fund.</TE>
<TE>   The new hires would not result in a decrease in other city
services, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   "This is not money that is allocated for any other programs,"
Burnham said. "This expense, at this point, won't take money from the
parks budget or any other department. This action has no relation to
other services in town."</TE>
<TE>   Sotelo said officials have discussed hiring more officers for
years.</TE>
<TE>   "If you take a look at Oxnard, you see that there's been
significant [population] growth in the past several years," he said.
"With that growth comes a demand for more services."</TE>
<TE>   Oxnard has about 182,000 residents, about 40,000 more than in
1990.</TE>
<TE>   Police Chief Art Lopez said the new officers would primarily be
patrol officers, allowing others to work on crime prevention
programs.</TE>
<TE>   "The city wants better service," Lopez said.</TE>

<HD>Small Farmers Plot Strategy</HD>
<DH>Up against big agribusiness and other pressures, Ventura
County growers gather to share ideas on what yields success.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Fred Alvarez</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Ventura grower Phil McGrath knows all about the challenges facing the
small farmer.</LD>
<LD>   Between the competition with corporate growers and the headaches
involved in getting his produce to market, the fifth-generation
family farmer says it was getting harder each year to keep his
23-acre operation afloat.</LD>
<LD>   That's why he carved a niche as an organic farmer a decade ago and
threw himself headlong into direct marketing, selling his goods to
local restaurants and at farmers markets and roadside stands.</LD>
<TE>   "You really can survive on a small scale," McGrath told other
farmers Monday at the 17th Annual California Small Farm Conference in
Ventura.</TE>
<TE>   "My whole theme is keep it fresh and keep it local," he said. "If
you grow on 23 acres and deliver directly, you can make it work."</TE>
<TE>   That message resonated loud and strong on the first full day of
the conference at the Holiday Inn.</TE>
<TE>   The event, which drew nearly 600 participants, featured workshops
on everything from record-keeping to agri-tourism, a combination of
agriculture and entertainment that many farmers are turning to in
order to see a profit.</TE>
<TE>   Will Stockwin, who is handling publicity for the conference, said
the annual event provides valuable support to small farmers,
especially at a time when the state is losing 1,200 of them a year.</TE>
<TE>   California has an estimated 60,000 small farms, which gross $1,000
to $250,000 a year, according to UC Davis.</TE>
<TE>   "The focus of this conference is to keep small farmers on their
land and prospering," Stockwin said. "We can't afford to keep losing
these people, because at some point we're going to look around and
wonder who is growing all our food."</TE>
<TE>   The conference, held annually at various locations throughout the
state, had plenty of local flavor.</TE>
<TE>   It featured a panel discussion on the effect on Ventura County
agriculture of a series of slow-growth measures adopted by voters
around the county in recent years.</TE>
<TE>   That movement, known as SOAR, has been aimed at preserving
farmland and other open space. But many in the agricultural industry
argue that it forces growers to keep farming long after it is
profitable, because it makes it difficult to sell farmland.</TE>
<TE>   The conference also showcased work done by the Ag Futures Alliance
-- made up of family farmers, environmentalists, farm worker
advocates and other disparate interests -- to keep the county's
agriculture industry alive and well.</TE>
<TE>   Those efforts helped spur new legislation, signed in September by
Gov. Gray Davis, giving agricultural officials more power to regulate
pesticide applications near schools.</TE>
<TE>   "It's critically important to get together to discuss the issues
facing all of agriculture, but especially those facing small
farmers," said Larry Yee, head of the county's UC Cooperative
Extension and moderator of the Ag Futures panel.</TE>
<TE>   "I think Ventura County is on the forefront of a lot of these
issues, and we have been experimenting with a lot of different ways
to resolve them," Yee said. "It's fortuitous to have this opportunity
to show and share some of the things we have been involved with."</TE>
<TE>   During a morning workshop, Ojai organic grower Steve Sprinkel
shared with dozens of growers his secret for capturing a share of the
market. Along with partner Olive Chase, he opened a small organic
store and cafe three years ago in Meiners Oaks and now sells directly
to his customers.</TE>
<TE>   Sprinkel, who has been farming since the 1960s, said that not only
is he able to sell what he grows on six acres in the Ojai Valley, but
he is able to push other local produce as well at his shop, The
Farmer and The Cook.</TE>
<TE>   No more worries about shipping, no worries about corporate
competition.</TE>
<TE>   "Pretty much everything I grow I'm able to market because I
designed it that way," he said. "I think this can happen locally in a
lot of places."</TE>

<HD>Facility Is Fined in Boy's Death</HD>
<DH>A skilled-nursing home in Tustin must pay $90,000 after a
7-year-old died during a procedure intended to help him breathe.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>David Haldane</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A skilled-nursing home at the Tustin Hospital and Medical Center has
been fined $90,000 and given the state's most severe citation in the
death last spring of a 7-year-old boy, state officials said Monday.</LD>
<LD>   "This is not common," Ken August, a spokesman for the California
Department of Health Services, said of the AA citation issued to the
medical center's skilled-nursing facility. "It's cited only when a
facility, through its action or inaction, causes the death of a
resident."</LD>
<LD>   In addition to the fine, he said, the facility was required to
submit a detailed plan to the state outlining steps it had taken or
planned to take to ensure that such an incident would not recur.
August said the plan has been submitted and approved.</LD>
<TE>   The hospital declined to respond Monday to several requests for
comment.</TE>
<TE>   According to August, the violation occurred June 5 when the
7-year-old, who had been admitted to the facility 18 months earlier
with a traumatic brain injury and seizure disorder, underwent a
breathing treatment administered by a respiratory therapist via the
patient's tracheostomy, an incision in his upper chest allowing him
to breathe.</TE>
<TE>   For unknown reasons and in violation of the facility's policy,
August said, the therapist left the child, whose name has not been
released, unattended for about 10 minutes. When he returned, the
spokesman said, the therapist found the breathing apparatus
disconnected and the patient dead.</TE>
<TE>   "The coroner was called, and it was determined that the cause of
death was respiratory failure," August said. "We were not able to
determine how the respirator became unattached."</TE>
<TE>   The investigation included a review of medical records and
interviews with staff, August said.</TE>
<TE>   "The facility's policy and procedure directs the respiratory
therapist to stay with the resident during the treatment," the health
department's press release said.</TE>
<TE>   August said he did not know whether the respiratory therapist
involved had been fired or what other steps the hospital had taken to
correct the situation.</TE>
<TE>   The state issues about a dozen AA citations a year, he said; any
facility receiving three or more in a 12-month period is in danger of
losing its certification. He said he was unaware of the Tustin
facility having received any previous AA citations.</TE>
<TE>   According to a recent report issued by the federal government,
which also inspects and rates nursing-care homes, the Tustin facility
was cited for 10 deficiencies -- slightly fewer than the state
average, but more than the national average -- during the 15-month
period ending Aug. 31.</TE>
<TE>   Although all the citations were relatively minor, one of them did
indicate that inspectors had determined that the facility failed to
"properly care for residents needing special services, including ...
tracheostomy care, tracheal suctioning" and "respiratory care."</TE>

<HD>Leaders of Hate Groups Held</HD>
<DH>O.C. authorities charge two white supremacists with having
bomb- making materials.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jeff Gottlieb</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Orange County authorities arrested two white supremacist leaders
Monday, charging them with having had materials to make a bomb in
1999, including 50 gallons of gasoline they kept in their Anaheim
apartment, enough to blow up the building.</LD>
<LD>   A third white supremacist leader was arrested on perjury and
weapons charges.</LD>
<LD>   The bomb complaint against Christine Greenwood and her boyfriend,
John Patrick McCabe, said authorities also found BBs, razor blades
and 16 nails that could be used as shrapnel, several battery-operated
clocks that could operate as timers, and a shopping list of
bomb-making materials.</LD>
<TE>   Deputy Dist. Atty. Nicholas S. Thompson said Greenwood and McCabe
did not appear to have a target. He said authorities did not move
against them two years ago because fears of terrorism weren't as high
a priority as now.</TE>
<TE>   The third suspect, John Frederick Steele II, was charged with
perjury and falsifying documents relating to financial statements he
was required to give his probation officer. Thompson said that during
a search of Steele's home Monday, authorities found a letter
addressed to the white supremacist Christian Defense League
advocating that members align themselves with Palestinian extremists
to target Jews.</TE>
<TE>   Steele is the California leader of Aryan Nations, known as the
Brandenburg Division. Aryan Nations is one of the country's most
influential racist groups.</TE>
<TE>   Greenwood is active in Women for Aryan Unity and was organizer of
the Aryan Baby Drive, which collects donated clothing for poor white
families. She also is active with the group Blood and Honour, as was
McCabe, her live-in boyfriend. The group promotes rock music with
racist themes.</TE>
<TE>   Greenwood, 28, and Steele, 29, were being held in the Orange
County Jail in lieu of $100,000 bail. McCabe, 23, already was in
prison for a probation violation. None of the three were represented
by attorneys as of late Monday.</TE>
<TE>   "This is the continuing effort by law enforcement to suck the
oxygen from these groups by going after their leaders and suing every
legal remedy to raise the price of doing their business in our
community," Dist. Atty. Tony Rackauckas said at a news conference
announcing the arrests.</TE>
<TE>   The bomb materials were discovered in April 1999 when probation
officials searched the apartment McCabe and Greenwood shared. At the
time, McCabe was on probation for a hate crime, Thompson said. He had
served six months in the Orange County Jail.</TE>
<TE>   A search of the probationer's apartment turned up child
pornography on a computer, which is what sent McCabe back to prison
to serve 16 months for violating probation, Thompson said.</TE>
<TE>   Thompson acknowledged that authorities could come in for criticism
and "potential embarrassment" for not acting earlier. "There's a
clear crime here that was frankly missed," he said.</TE>
<TE>   He said that before the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, the emphasis was
not on terrorism. Thompson said that after the attacks, he became the
district attorney's representative to local terrorist task forces.</TE>
<TE>   The Orange County Probation Department subsequently brought him
the information about the bomb-making materials found in the April
1999 search.</TE>
<TE>   McCabe's arrest two years earlier seemed to have broken the
momentum of the bomb plans, Thompson said. Until the new charges were
filed, McCabe had been scheduled for release from prison in three
months.</TE>
<TE>   Steele, a security guard at the Port of Los Angeles, was on
probation for assault with a deadly weapon for stabbing a Latino man,
Thompson said.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities arrested him about 8 a.m. Monday without incident as
he went to his car. During a search of his Long Beach apartment, they
found four pistols and a slew of racist materials, which he is not
allowed to have as a condition of his probation.</TE>
<TE>   A port spokeswoman said Steele was not on the harbor payroll, but
could have been working as a private security guard.</TE>
<TE>   Thompson said Steele was well-known to Los Angeles police for
distributing racist literature.</TE>
<TE>   He also came to the attention of local authorities this spring
when he was organizing a celebration of Hitler's birthday at a La
Habra Moose Lodge. Rackauckas said the event was canceled when
Steele's probation officer found out about it.</TE>
<TE>   Terms of Steele's parole forbid his association with members of
extremist organizations, attending extremist events or possessing
extremist paraphernalia.</TE>

<HD>Best October Since '88 in Home Sales</HD>
<DH>Ventura County median price of $331,000, up 15% from a year
ago, is expected to keep rising, fueled by high demand and low
interest rates.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Gregory W. Griggs</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Maintaining a vigor not seen since the last Southern California
housing boom, Ventura County home sales surged 8.3% in October to the
highest level for the month since October 1988.</LD>
<LD>   New figures also show that the price of a typical county home --
after a huge run-up the previous two years -- remained about the same
for the fifth straight month.</LD>
<LD>   A total of 1,507 new and existing homes and condominiums sold in
October, 115 more than the same month a year ago, according to
figures compiled by DataQuick Information Systems. The median price
jumped 15.3%, to $331,000, from the same month last year and was the
highest October median figure since the company began keeping local
statistics 14 years ago.</LD>
<TE>   John Karevoll, an analyst with DataQuick, said the combination of
the lowest home loan rates in decades and a constant demand for real
estate should keep the area's home sales and prices strong. He
predicts the median price will increase to $340,000 before January.</TE>
<TE>   "The demand is fairly stable and can be met because of low
interest rates," Karevoll said. "I don't see any signs of anything
changing. I know there are numerous prognostications of impending
doom, but we don't see it."</TE>
<TE>   Karevoll said that even if the U.S. goes to war with Iraq, the
housing market's resiliency should mean only a brief drop in sales.
If the conflict were short-lived, the market should rebound in a
month or two, he said.</TE>
<TE>   The number of homes sold was up 7.7% from September but down 11%,
or 191, from August.</TE>
<TE>   The October median price was down $2,000 from September, but
matches the $331,000 reached in July. Since June, when the median was
$335,000, county home prices have been within that $4,000 range. The
median is the price where half the homes sold for more and half for
less.</TE>
<TE>   Even though the median has reached a temporary plateau, economists
don't foresee a drop in home value.</TE>
<TE>   "Given the limited supply of homes available and the demand in
this area, we don't expect home prices to fall," said Bill Watkins,
director of the Economic Forecast Project at UC Santa Barbara.</TE>
<TE>   Watkins, whose project regularly tracks the local economy, said
Ventura County was largely unaffected by the recession, when nonstop
growth in the value of its goods and services is taken into account.</TE>
<TE>   Such robust economic activity, along with a limited supply of
available homes, should continue to push prices higher next year, but
at a slower rate, Watkins said.</TE>
<TE>   Calling this "an extremely desirable place to live," Watkins said
local home prices, still a bargain compared with the Santa Barbara
market, help explain why 9,000 to 10,000 people who work in Santa
Barbara County commute daily from western Ventura County.</TE>
<TE>   In the west county, sales in downtown Ventura increased nearly
37%, compared with October 2001, and the median price rose about 40%
to $290,750. In north Oxnard, nearly 41% more properties were sold,
with a median price of $335,000, a 28.2% increase.</TE>
<TE>   In the east county, sales in Moorpark jumped 47%, with a median
price of $390,000, an increase of 23.4%. Oak Park prices dropped 3.4%
to $420,000. In the Newbury Park portion of Thousand Oaks, fewer
units were sold, but prices were higher, with the median reaching
$455,000.</TE>
<TE>   Charles Maxey, dean of the business school at Cal Lutheran
University in Thousand Oaks, warns that unabated home price increases
will keep more young professionals from living in this area and may
force employers to move closer to where their employees can find
affordable housing.</TE>
<TE>   "This isn't speculation," Maxey said. "It's the basic forces of
supply and demand, which means we have a real problem. If this isn't
a short-term bubble and the sort of thing that will clear itself up
quickly, it means we have a serious, long-term public policy problem
we have to confront."</TE>
<TE>   Cities must allow greater density within their borders to
accommodate more housing, Maxey said, adding that despite popular
belief, more homes would actually help reduce freeway congestion.</TE>
<TE>   "High housing prices exacerbate the traffic problems, because
people have to travel from farther away to come to work," he said.</TE>

<HD>Trial Is Underway in Fatal Stabbing of Football Player</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>From a Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Jurors began hearing testimony Monday in the trial of an Oxnard man
accused of fatally stabbing a semipro football player during a fight
over a woman earlier this year.</LD>
<LD>   Artis Jackson, a 25-year-old Oxnard resident who played football
for the Pasadena-based California Bandits, died in March as a result
of stab wounds to the neck and back.</LD>
<LD>   Robert Hosea surrendered to police four hours after the stabbing
and was later charged with murder.</LD>
<TE>   Police and prosecutors said Hosea and Jackson knew each other and
got into an argument over a woman they both knew.</TE>
<TE>   During opening statements in Hosea's trial Monday, a prosecutor
told jurors that evidence would show that Hosea deliberately stabbed
Jackson during a fight over Jackson's girlfriend.</TE>
<TE>   But Hosea's court-appointed lawyer told jurors that his client
acted in self-defense in the fight outside the Vineyard Avenue
apartment complex where Jackson lived with his girlfriend, their
7-year-old son and other relatives.</TE>
<TE>   Testimony is scheduled to resume today in Ventura County Superior
Court.</TE>

<BD>From a Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Orange County Grand Jury on Monday urged the Board of Supervisors
to do a better job of monitoring how recommendations made by the jury
are implemented.</LD>
<LD>   The grand jury comprises 19 citizens who, among other duties,
watch over government institutions.</LD>
<LD>   According to the report, the county does not have a way to make
sure the grand jury's recommendations and suggestions for improving
government operations are acted upon.</LD>
<TE>   "A coordinated manner to track the status of implementation has
never been in place," the jury wrote.</TE>
<TE>   "A Grand Jury recommendation could fail to be implemented over
time unless the [county] staff has been tracking, monitoring and
reporting on the progress of the planned effort."</TE>
<TE>   The panel recommended that the county executive officer report to
the Board of Supervisors on items not yet acted upon.</TE>
<TE>   It also suggested that the CEO's office prepare a detailed,
written report for the grand jury by mid-March each year on the
status of items that remain open.</TE>

<HD>Santa Ana OKs Razing of 1920s Building</HD>
<DH>Council overrules city planners and will let developer tear
down structure at 1st and Main and replace it with a pharmacy and
lofts.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jennifer Mena</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Santa Ana City Council voted Monday to let a developer tear down
a 1920s-era building at the entryway to the city's historic downtown
and replace it with a pharmacy and four residential lofts.</LD>
<LD>   Overruling its own Planning Commission, the council reluctantly
voted 5 to 2 to let the property owner raze the old Central Auto Body
Works building at 1st and Main streets and put a Sav-On drugstore in
its place.</LD>
<LD>   The decision ends years of turmoil over the fate of the
cornerstone property, which has been the subject of a long legal
battle between the city and the developer, M&amp;A Gabaee of Beverly
Hills.</LD>
<TE>   Most of the council members expressed reservations about the
project even as they voted to approve it. But they said they felt
they were out of options because of the possibility of additional
lawsuits over the development.</TE>
<TE>   "As far as I am concerned, we have no choice here," Councilman
Brett Franklin said. "We have been told that we will face financial
Armageddon in the downtown if we do not approve this project."</TE>
<TE>   City officials would say only that further litigation brought by
the property owner could result in a multimillion-dollar judgment
against Santa Ana.</TE>
<TE>   The project is part of a settlement to a lawsuit in which the
developer alleged Santa Ana was hindering development. City officials
asked that the lofts be added to boost the adjacent Artists Village.</TE>
<TE>   But the Planning Commission last month denied the proposal, citing
the loss of a historic building, lack of parking and an adjacent
Rite-Aid pharmacy. Commissioners also expressed concern about
granting another liquor license in the downtown.</TE>
<TE>   Mayor Miguel Pulido, however, said he would have voted for the
project even if there hadn't been a lawsuit. The old building was "a
black eye" that will be replaced by "a good project." Council members
Lisa Bist and Alberta D. Christy voted against the proposal.</TE>
<TE>   Over the last 10 years, the real estate company has proposed a
restaurant, an auto parts store and a small shopping center on the
corner -- regarded as the gateway to the city's downtown.</TE>
<TE>   Some believe the city should have purchased the property years ago
to give it a larger role in shaping its destiny.</TE>
<TE>   The drugstore and lofts are expected to be completed in mid-2003.</TE>

<HD>Vasco Defense Shifts the Blame</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Mai Tran</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Attorneys defending Adriana Vasco, accused of hiring a hit man to
kill the wife of her lover, on Monday blamed the man accused of
pulling the trigger.</LD>
<LD>   Prosecutors say that Vasco, 35, who is a medical secretary, and
anesthesiologist Kenneth Stahl, 57, launched the plan to kill Stahl's
wife, optometrist Carolyn Oppy-Stahl, 44, but that it went awry.</LD>
<LD>   The doctor and his wife were slain on a stretch of Ortega Highway
in November 1999. Stahl was to have driven his wife to the slaying
site on a pretext but ended up being killed with her, the prosecution
says.</LD>
<TE>   Dennis Earl Godley, 32, Vasco's boyfriend and a handyman at her
Anaheim apartment complex, is accused of killing the couple and faces
trial next year.</TE>
<TE>   Vasco, prosecutors say, had carried on an affair with the doctor,
who gave her gifts and complained about his wife, whom he wanted to
divorce but didn't because he feared he'd lose money.</TE>
<TE>   Defense attorneys suggested that Godley had beaten Vasco and that
she was under his control.</TE>
<TE>   They portrayed him as an armed, abusive and controlling man with
an explosive temper.</TE>
<TE>   Richard Anaya, an electrician who did work at Stahl's Huntington
Beach townhome, testified Monday in Orange County Superior Court that
he was recruited to kill Stahl's wife but had turned down the offer.</TE>
<TE>   Anaya said Stahl told him: "I need someone to take care of my
wife. Do you know anybody?"</TE>
<TE>   "I thought he had been drinking," Anaya said. "Finally, I told him
to stop right there."</TE>
<TE>   Belen Lopez, who lived in the same apartment complex as Vasco,
said Godley kept a shotgun behind the front door and carried it
around the complex several times.</TE>

<LD>Here we go again.</LD>
<LD>   Every year, after Southern California gets its first rain of the
season, East Coast transplants and other non-natives living in the
sunny Southland issue that same old complaint: "Los Angeles drivers
don't know how to drive in the rain!"</LD>
<LD>   "Good golly, a little sprinkle and we get 520-some accidents in
Southern California. Puhleeease," an angry out-of-state driver ranted
in an Internet chat room.</LD>
<TE>   On another Web site, someone posted a phony "Los Angeles Driver's
Exam" that included the following test question:</TE>
<TE>   In the instance of rain, you should:</TE>
<TE>   a) Never drive over 5 mph.</TE>
<TE>   b) Drive twice as fast as usual.</TE>
<TE>   c) You're not sure what "rain" is.</TE>
<TE>   The storm that blew through the state earlier this month brought
with it those same old complaints. This time, even the New York Times
took a shot at Angelenos, reporting the first shower of the season
under the headline: "Los Angeles Can't Cope as Rain Finally Arrives."</TE>
<TE>   Before we blindly accept this harsh stereotype about our driving
skills, let's look at the facts.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, Los Angeles County had 60,204 fatal and injury
accidents on the road, 2,716 of which occurred during wet weather,
according to the California Highway Patrol. That means that only
about 5% of all fatal and injury accidents in the county took place
in the rain.</TE>
<TE>   If you calculate the same numbers for, say, San Francisco, you'll
find that 8% of its traffic accidents took place in the rain in 2001.
Factor in that San Francisco has, on average, nearly twice as many
days of rain as Los Angeles and you find that the regions are roughly
comparable when it comes to rainy-day accidents. If Angelenos lack
rain-driving skills, then our Bay Area brethren are not much better.</TE>
<TE>   But some transplants say the problem is not that Angelenos drive
recklessly in the rain. It is that we are overly cautious, driving
with one foot glued to the brake pedal at the first sign of a rain
cloud overhead.</TE>
<TE>   That is the sentiment of Kenneth R. Crudup, a Chicago native who
now lives in Long Beach. Back when he lived in Chicago, Crudup said
he could speed through six inches of snow at 55 mph.</TE>
<TE>   But in L.A., he said, motorists panic at the first raindrop.</TE>
<TE>   "It once took me almost three hours to go from Irvine to Marina
del Rey at 6:30 p.m. on a Tuesday night, all because of a rain that
in most parts of the country many folks wouldn't even brandish an
umbrella in," Crudup said.</TE>
<TE>   The reason for our overly cautious behavior? It's not a brain
disorder caused by overexposure to Botox and car exhaust. Instead,
traffic experts say Angelenos are tentative drivers in the rain
simply because we are so rarely exposed to wet weather.</TE>
<TE>   On average, the Los Angeles Basin has only 35 days of measurable
rain each year. That's about 10% of the year. Los Angeles residents
enjoy clear, sunny skies 186 days a year.</TE>
<TE>   When a storm came through California two weeks ago, it had been
283 days since the last big rainstorm dropped in on the Los Angeles
metropolitan area.</TE>
<TE>   Snow? The last time downtown Los Angeles had any measurable snow,
Madonna really was a virgin.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think we are inherently bad drivers," said CHP spokesman
Tom Marshall, another Chicago native who now lives in sunny
California. "We just don't have the practice that other drivers have
in wet weather."</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps Chicagoans like Marshall and Crudup learned how to drive
in the rain because they had to: "The Windy City" averages about 126
days of rain and about three feet of snow each year. Before they
moved to California, Marshall and Crudup probably lived in rain boots
and galoshes.</TE>
<TE>   New Yorkers can boast all they want about their superior
rain-driving skills, but those bragging rights come with an average
of 121 days of rain and at least a week of snow each year.</TE>
<TE>   So, if the big problem with Angelenos is that we drive too slowly
in the rain, what's the problem? That's what driving experts say we
are supposed to do.</TE>
<TE>   "The most important thing to do is slow down because it takes
longer to stop in the rain," said Arline Dillman, traffic safety
manager for the Automobile Club of Southern California.</TE>
<TE>   Because it rains so rarely in L.A., she said, more oil, grime and
dirt accumulates on our roads, making the pavement extra slippery
when the first shower of the season blows into town.</TE>
<TE>   Angelenos also have another incentive to drive extra slow in the
rain: Most Southern California freeways are already operating at or
beyond capacity, meaning there is very little room for driver error.
One tiny motorist miscue in the rain and an entire freeway
interchange can turn into an automotive mosh pit.</TE>
<TE>   Consider what happened early one Sunday morning a couple of weeks
ago when an unusually heavy fog descended on the Long Beach Freeway,
resulting in a 198-car pileup that injured 41 people. Police blamed
the accident on excessive speed, blinding fog and typical Southern
California traffic. Had the pileup occurred during the weekday rush
hour, the toll might have been worse.</TE>
<TE>   (By the way, Angelenos are not the only drivers who have trouble
driving in fog. A week after the Long Beach Freeway accident, a
similar fog-related pileup killed 10 people in Wisconsin, where lousy
driving weather is practically the norm.)</TE>
<TE>   OK, so maybe Angelenos don't know how to drive in inclement
weather. Can you blame us? With only 35 days a year of rain, we
rarely get the practice.</TE>
<TE>   If you feel you need more practice driving in lousy weather, here
is an idea: Move to Chicago.</TE>

<TE>   Critics say Angelenos don't know how to drive in the rain. Maybe
it's because we are rarely exposed to it. The following is a list of
major American cities and the average number of days they have at
least 0.01 inches of rain each year.</TE>

<CX>   Traffic pileup -- A Behind the Wheel story in Tuesday's California
section about driving in the rain erroneously said that a freeway
pileup in Wisconsin took place a week after a similar multi-car

<HD>Alabama Governor Says He Concedes the Election</HD>
<DH>Don Siegelman halts his legal fight for recount. Bob Riley
will become just the third GOP governor for the state since
Reconstruction.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>MONTGOMERY, Ala.</DL>
<LD>Saying he didn't want to hurt Alabama, Democratic Gov. Don Siegelman
gave up his bid for a second term Monday and conceded the nation's
last undecided governor's race to Republican Rep. Bob Riley.</LD>
<LD>   Riley, 58, will become just the third Republican governor in
Alabama since Reconstruction when he is inaugurated in January. The
GOP now holds a 26-24 advantage over Democrats in governorships.</LD>
<LD>   Siegelman, who announced his decision at the state Capitol, said
he felt he could have won a recount, but it would have taken months
of legal wrangling.</LD>
<TE>   "So for the good of the state of Alabama, for the good of our
people, I am dropping my request for a recount," Siegelman said.</TE>
<TE>   Siegelman and Riley spent months and more than $22 million trading
attack ads and, since election day, each had acted as if he was
Alabama's next governor.</TE>
<TE>   The governor called Riley to inform him of his decision.</TE>
<TE>   "The governor was very gracious and offered his support in the
transition," Riley said.</TE>
<TE>   Riley won by 3,117 votes out of 1.3 million cast, or by 0.23 of a
percentage point. Siegelman had sought a statewide recount,
complaining about the accuracy of the optical scanners used to read
ballots.</TE>
<TE>   On election night, Siegelman led in unofficial returns and called
on Riley to concede. But Riley jumped in front when officials in
Baldwin County, a GOP stronghold, reduced Siegelman's total by nearly
7,000 votes, saying a computer glitch in their election system had
overstated his returns.</TE>
<TE>   Siegelman's supporters filed petitions in every Alabama county,
seeking a recount, including a hand tally in Baldwin County. The move
was all but shut down by Republican Atty. Gen. Bill Pryor, who cited
a state law that keeps ballots sealed except in limited
circumstances.</TE>
<TE>   The Alabama Supreme Court had been considering the legality of a
recount when Siegelman reached his decision.</TE>
<TE>   In his announcement, Siegelman said "serious questions" had been
raised about the vote returns in Baldwin County. But, the governor
said, he decided to avoid "a long, divisive fight."</TE>
<TE>   Siegelman, 56, ends 20 years in public office that took him from
secretary of state to the state's top office. He was credited with
the largest school construction and rural road programs in state
history, and for helping bring thousands of new auto industry jobs to
Alabama.</TE>
<TE>   But Riley ran on a slogan of "honest change," hammering the
governor over an investigation of his finances and allegations that
friends won sweetheart deals from the state.</TE>
<TE>   Riley said his challenge now is to bring Alabama together, with
the job done by President Bush after his 500-vote victory in Florida
serving as his model.</TE>
<TE>   "If I can reach out to all the people of the state and be half as
successful as he's been, Alabama will be a better place," Riley said
in an interview.</TE>
<TE>   The three-term congressman wears cowboy boots with business suits
-- a fitting combination for a man whose resume begins with poultry
farmer.</TE>
<TE>   He is a millionaire businessman who also had success in a car
dealership and a trucking company before getting elected to Congress.</TE>
<TE>   Riley has spent his entire life in the east Alabama town of
Ashland and he exploited his rural roots in his campaign. Commercials
showed him walking across his farm and sitting astride his horse in a
Ronald Reagan-like pose.</TE>
<TE>   Riley initially wavered on running because one of his daughters
was terminally ill with cancer. With her encouragement, he entered
the race six weeks before her death in August 2001 and told voters he
would be a governor they would be proud of.</TE>
<TE>   He also reached out to traditionally Democratic black voters in an
attempt to broaden the GOP. Johnny Ford, a Democratic state lawmaker
from Tuskegee, said the congressman worked so hard on behalf of
blacks in his district -- including securing $30 million in federal
funding for the Tuskegee Airmen Museum -- that he decided to remain
neutral in the governor's race.</TE>
<TE>   Riley jokes that his success in politics and business stems from
having to clean out chicken houses as a teenager. "I knew I didn't
want to do that the rest of my life," he said during the campaign.</TE>

<HD>Researchers Link Sleep Apnea and Stuttering</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Stuttering and a serious form of snoring known as sleep apnea may be
linked, and both conditions may be caused by brain damage sustained
early in life, U.S. researchers said Monday.</LD>
<LD>   A team at UCLA found that nearly 40% of sleep apnea patients it
studied also stuttered as children.</LD>
<LD>   Sleep apnea is a serious form of snoring in which a patient's
breathing actually stops several times a night. It is linked with a
high rate of heart death.</LD>
<TE>   "For decades, we have blamed sleep apnea solely on a narrowed
airway caused by enlarged tonsils, a small jaw or excess fat in the
throat," Ronald M. Harper, a professor of neurobiology who led the
study, said in a statement.</TE>
<TE>   "Our findings show, however, that sleep apnea patients also suffer
disordered wiring in brain regions that control muscles of the
airway. These glitches may lead to the syndrome."</TE>
<TE>   Writing in the American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care
Medicine, Harper and his colleagues said they used magnetic resonance
imaging to compare the brains of 21 men diagnosed with sleep apnea
with 21 men free of the disorder.</TE>
<TE>   The MRIs revealed a dramatic loss of gray matter -- brain cells --
in the men with sleep apnea. The worst-hit areas were those involved
in speech production, movement and emotion.</TE>
<TE>   The amount of brain damage correlated directly to the severity of
sleep apnea. The healthy men's brains were 2% to 18% larger in these
areas than the men with sleep apnea.</TE>
<TE>   "We propose that early damage to the brain's speech center
triggers problems in the muscles that control the airway. This, in
turn, eventually leads to sleep apnea," said Paul Macey, who also
worked on the study.</TE>
<TE>   "Because the sleep apnea patients possessed speech impairments
from childhood, and their brain's speech center revealed significant
gray matter loss, this brain damage likely originated early in life."</TE>
<TE>   The researchers said that 38% of the sleep apnea patients reported
a history of stuttering or speech impairment. Overall, 7% of the
general population stutters.</TE>
<TE>   "Speech impediments may prove an important diagnostic clue for
assessing and treating sleep apnea," Macey added. "In the future,
doctors may monitor certain brain structures and examine children for
speech or movement problems that may predict a higher sleep apnea
risk."</TE>

<HD>U.S. Releases First State-by-State Report on Cancer
Occurrences</HD>
<DH>Groundbreaking data on the disease can be used to find
unusual patterns, agency says.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The U.S. government released its first state-by-state report on
cancer Monday and said it can use the information to find unusual
patterns of cancer incidence.</LD>
<LD>   Careful analysis of the data should reveal patterns of disease
that may prove important, said the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention, which released the report.</LD>
<LD>   Until now, the United States was one of the few industrialized
nations that lacked a national cancer registry. Health experts used
statistical analysis and extrapolation to project rates for cancer
incidence and death.</LD>
<TE>   "Canada and the U.K. and a lot of countries have national cancer
surveillance systems in place. Now the United States, for the first
time, has that capability," CDC cancer expert Hannah Weir said in a
telephone interview.</TE>
<TE>   "Now we are actually able to start to identify the geographic
variability in incidence rates in the United States ... [and] to be
able to ... better coordinate cancer prevention and control
activities."</TE>
<TE>   But Weir and other CDC officials declined to identify any
geographic variations in general cancer rates, saying it was too soon
to say anything informative about them.</TE>
<TE>   "I would caution against trying to identify clusters of cancers in
this report," she said.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't have all states' data in the report [and] when you only
have one year's incidence data it is really hard to know what is
going on. One state may have the highest rate this year for one
cancer and the next year it may not be high at all."</TE>
<TE>   Weir did note that the five states with the highest rates of
colorectal cancer, the third leading cause of cancer in the United
States, were all in the East. New Mexico and Utah, in the West,
tended to have the lowest rates. "But we don't see that with all
cancers," she said.</TE>
<TE>   It would take several years of states showing the same pattern to
raise concerns.</TE>
<TE>   "If this gradient persists, then you'd want to do some research to
start getting into the question of why these rates would be higher,"
she said.</TE>
<TE>   "Are the risk factors higher in the population? For example, we
know that smoking is a risk factor for lung cancer. Does it surprise
us that a tobacco-producing state like Kentucky has a higher rate of
lung cancer?"</TE>
<TE>   Cancer is the second-leading cause of death in the United States,
after heart disease.</TE>
<TE>   Health officials say about a third of all cancer cases are caused
by lifestyle factors, such as diet, smoking and a lack of exercise.</TE>
<TE>   The CDC, the National Cancer Institute and the American Cancer
Society have collaborated for years to produce annual cancer
statistics, but their rates have been based on 14% of the U.S.
population.</TE>
<TE>   Weir said the CDC was cheered to find the new statistics, based on
78% of the population, bear out the older findings. For instance,
prostate cancer is the leading cause of cancer among men, breast
cancer among women, and lung and colon cancer come in second and
third, respectively, for both sexes.</TE>

<HD>Inmate's Procreation Appeal Is Rejected by U.S. Justices</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>-- David G. Savage</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The proposed constitutional right of prisoners to procreate from
behind bars expired quietly at the Supreme Court on Monday.</LD>
<LD>   The justices refused without comment to consider the issue, which
had bitterly split the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals in
California.</LD>
<LD>   William Gerber, an inmate serving a life term under the state's
three-strikes law, said he should be allowed to ship his sperm to his
wife so she could be impregnated by artificial insemination.</LD>
<TE>   Last year, he won a brief victory before a panel of the 9th
Circuit. In a 2-1 ruling, it said the Constitution protected the
fundamental right to procreate. Unless prison officials could show a
strong reason why this would interfere with prison security, Gerber's
claim should be honored, it ruled.</TE>
<TE>   "This is the seminal case, in more ways than one," said Judge
Barry Silverman in dissent at the time.</TE>
<TE>   The full court took up the issue, and Silverman spoke for the 6-5
majority in May that rejected Gerber's claim and concluded that
inmates lacked the same basic rights as others.</TE>
<TE>   His lawyer, Teresa Zuber of Sacramento, appealed to the Supreme
Court. She argued that the prison's refusal to allow Gerber to "send
his semen out of the prison" to his wife, Evelyn, violated his rights
to due process of law, the equal protection of the laws and his right
against cruel and unusual punishment.</TE>
<TE>   In a one-line order Monday, the justices refused to consider the
case of William Gerber vs. Roderick Hickman, the warden of Mule Creek
State Prison.</TE>
<TE>   Many state inmates are permitted conjugal visits with their
spouses, but this privilege is denied to those serving life terms.</TE>

<HD>Court to Hear Discrimination Case</HD>
<DH>Justices will decide on an unusual claim to resolve the
broad issue of a state's immunity from being sued under the
disabilities act.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>David G. Savage</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>WASHINGTON -- The Supreme Court, taking up an appeal from the
California Medical Board, agreed Monday to decide whether state
agencies are shielded from being sued under the federal law that bars
discrimination against people with disabilities.</LD>
<LD>   Since 1996, the high court has handed down a series of rulings
that say the states as "sovereign entities" cannot be sued under
various federal antidiscrimination laws.</LD>
<LD>   Two years ago, the court, by a 5-4 vote, said disabled workers
cannot sue the states that employ them under the Americans With
Disabilities Act.</LD>
<TE>   The new case tests whether that same rule of immunity applies when
the state is accused of discriminating against the disabled in
providing public services.</TE>
<TE>   In the past, federal antidiscrimination laws have forced state
colleges, libraries, courts and other public entities to make their
buildings accessible to those in wheelchairs.</TE>
<TE>   But the justices took up a rather unusual claim to resolve the
broad issue of a state's immunity from being sued.</TE>
<TE>   Dr. Michael J. Hason was turned down for a medical license by the
California Medical Board in 1995 on the grounds that he was mentally
ill and had a history of severe depression and drug dependency.</TE>
<TE>   Hason sued the board on his own behalf, alleging that he was a
victim of discrimination because of his mental illness.</TE>
<TE>   The state's lawyers said the suit should be thrown out because it
did not provide a general public service, akin to a library.
Moreover, the state had a "sovereign immunity" from such suits, they
said.</TE>
<TE>   "This involves the right and duty of the state to regulate the
licensing of physicians for the public safety," said Joel A. Davis, a
deputy state attorney general in Los Angeles. "The federal courts
should not be deciding who becomes a doctor or a surgeon."</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals refused to dismiss the
lawsuit. In the end, Hason may not be able to show he was a
"qualified individual with a disability" who suffered unfair
discrimination, the appeals court said. But the state is not immune
from all such suits, it concluded.</TE>
<TE>   Atty. Gen. Bill Lockyer appealed to the Supreme Court.</TE>
<TE>   In taking the case, the justices said they would not focus on the
special status of the state medical board, but instead would decide
the broad question of whether all state agencies are shielded from
being sued by disabled persons who say they were denied fair
treatment or equal benefits in the "services, programs or activities"
of a state agency.</TE>
<TE>   This case does not affect local governments or school districts,
however. The doctrine of "state sovereign immunity" shields agencies
that are part of state government, but not county or municipal
governments.</TE>
<TE>   The case of California Medical Board vs. Hason is due to be argued
early next year.</TE>
<TE>   In other cases:</TE>
<TE>   Campaign contributions: The court said it would decide whether
nonprofit advocacy groups that are incorporated have a free-speech
right to contribute to the campaign of federal office seekers.</TE>
<TE>   In this case, the Bush administration finds itself in the awkward
spot of challenging North Carolina Right to Life, an anti-abortion
group.</TE>
<TE>   Since 1907, federal law has barred corporations from funding
campaigns. Federal Elections Commission regulations make no exception
for nonprofit groups that are incorporated.</TE>
<TE>   But the U.S. Court of Appeals in Richmond, Va., sided with the
antiabortion group, which challenged the restriction as
unconstitutional.</TE>
<TE>   Solicitor General Theodore B. Olson, representing the government
and the election commission, urged the high court to uphold the
existing law (FEC vs. Beaumont). This dispute, however, predates the
pending challenge to the new McCain-Feingold campaign finance law,
which may reach the court early next year.</TE>
<TE>   Bad lawyering: In a Maryland case, the court agreed to decide
whether a defense lawyer's failure to investigate his client's case
calls for overturning a conviction and death sentence.</TE>
<TE>   The justices have been split on what to do about bad lawyers whose
errors can doom their clients to death. This case, Wiggins vs.
Corcoran, calls for setting a clear rule.</TE>
<TE>   Corneas: The court refused to block a lawsuit against the Los
Angeles County coroner's office for having removed the corneas of
children without obtaining their parents' permission.</TE>
<TE>   An earlier state law had allowed this practice when no objection
was raised. A new law requires consent in advance.</TE>

<HD>Homeland Security Hits Snag at Wire</HD>
<DH>Senate Democrats seek to kill special-interest provisions,
which could lead to delay in passage of bill. The move prompts heated
debate.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Nick Anderson</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>With a vote expected today, the Senate is sharply divided on a
Democratic proposal to strip a handful of special-interest provisions
from a bill that would create a new homeland security agency.</LD>
<LD>   The amendment's approval could trip up the bill just short of the
finish line; rejection would clear the way for the Senate to send the
bill to President Bush.</LD>
<LD>   In another scenario, the Republican-led House could bow to any
Senate revisions and wave the bill on to the White House. Or the
House could insist on further negotiations, delaying -- and perhaps
jeopardizing -- the measure Bush has pressed the lame-duck Congress
to pass.</LD>
<TE>   No matter what happens, the Democratic amendment has prompted a
heated debate over legal protections for vaccine makers and other
businesses at a moment when Bush stands on the verge of achieving the
most significant government reorganization since the start of the
Cold War.</TE>
<TE>   At issue are seven provisions in a House-passed homeland security
bill. They include liability protections for certain industries, a
waiver of open-meeting law, a potential break for firms that move
overseas to avoid U.S. taxes and a plan for a research center that
may be aimed at a lawmaker-favored university.</TE>
<TE>   Senate Democrats criticize most of these provisions as gifts to
big business that have nothing to do with the creation of a
Cabinet-level Department of Homeland Security to defend against
terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   The provision that has drawn the most attention would grant
liability protection to Eli Lilly and Co. and other drug firms that
make a mercury-based vaccine preservative. Several suits have alleged
that such preservatives cause autism in children.</TE>
<TE>   Several Senate Democrats, led by Majority Leader Tom Daschle of
South Dakota and Joseph I. Lieberman of Connecticut, have attacked
the provision.</TE>
<TE>   But some prominent Republicans and the White House have said it is
necessary if drug makers are to join the war on terrorism with
products meant to thwart biological attacks.</TE>
<TE>   Other senators have criticized the provision, but they so far have
stopped short of saying they would vote for the amendment to delete
it from the bill.</TE>
<TE>   The swing votes include independent Sen. Dean Barkley of
Minnesota, whose short tenure in office as the successor to the late
Sen. Paul Wellstone (D-Minn.) will end with the lame-duck session.</TE>
<TE>   Also undecided as of Monday were GOP Sens. Lincoln Chafee of Rhode
Island and Susan Collins of Maine.</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Zell Miller (D-Ga.) is expected to side with Republican
leaders in opposition to the amendment, said his spokeswoman, Camille
Osborne. Miller has consistently backed the White House on the bill.</TE>
<TE>   But Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) plans to vote for the amendment,
said his spokesman, Marshall Wittmann. He said McCain believes the
controversial provisions in the House bill are "a poor way to do
business."</TE>
<TE>   Republican and Democratic aides said Monday that the vote appears
to be too close to call. Democrats would need a simple majority to
pass the amendment.</TE>
<TE>   The security bill would establish an anti-terrorism agency with
roughly 170,000 employees, drawn from 22 federal agencies now
scattered throughout the government. The department would include the
Coast Guard, the Customs Service, the Transportation Security
Administration, the Secret Service and other agencies.</TE>
<TE>   But the bill would be derailed if the two houses of Congress
failed to agree on final language. And some congressional Republicans
are pledging a fight if the Senate amends the measure.</TE>
<TE>   House Majority Whip Tom DeLay (R-Texas) said Monday that the
Republican leadership would be willing to call the House -- which has
all but adjourned for the year -- back to Washington to push for its
version of the bill.</TE>
<TE>   The House approved the measure last week, 299 to 121. That vote
came after Democrats yielded much of the flexibility that Bush sought
for the personnel rules that would govern the new agency.</TE>
<TE>   During the fall campaign, Bush continually criticized Senate
Democratic leaders for letting the disagreement over personnel rules
hold up action on the bill. DeLay echoed that argument in comments on
the current dispute.</TE>
<TE>   "By thwarting the new Homeland Security Department, Daschle's
continued obstruction ignores the American people's unmistakable
demand to grant President Bush the authority to strengthen the
country," DeLay said.</TE>

<HD>Airport Worker Arrests Assailed as Too Sweeping</HD>
<DH>Though no terrorists have been caught, federal officials
defend the action. Critics say immigrants are among the hundreds
held.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Ricardo Alonso-Zaldivar</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>WASHINGTON -- About 800 people have been arrested since December in
ongoing sweeps of airport workers around the country in an operation
proponents call vital to national security but critics decry as
overzealous law enforcement.</LD>
<LD>   No terrorism suspects have been caught so far in Operation Tarmac,
but many undocumented immigrants with humble jobs have been arrested.
Among them was cleaning woman Angelica Barrera, who was taken in
handcuffs from jail to the hospital to give birth.</LD>
<LD>   She wasn't accused of violence or theft, but of using false
identification to get a job at John Wayne Airport in Orange County.
Charges were later dropped, but Barrera laments not being allowed to
cuddle her baby daughter the night she was born. The mother said she
was hurried back to a cell.</LD>
<TE>   Federal officials strongly defend the sweeps, saying it would be
irresponsible not to thoroughly check airport workers after the Sept.
11 attacks. They note that Operation Tarmac has snared a number of
felons who are now barred from working at airports. But among the
immigrants, many once-normal lives have been upended, prompting
outcries that the government is penalizing harmless individuals.</TE>
<TE>   In Southern California, more than 80 employees whose jobs gave
them access beyond the security checkpoints were arrested in late
August. Nathan Marquez drove a catering truck that serviced planes at
Los Angeles International Airport.</TE>
<TE>   "We are not terrorists, we are workers," said Marquez, who was
fired after being arrested for allegedly using a false Social
Security number. A naturalized U.S. citizen, Marquez had had no other
problems with the law. Federal prosecutors later dropped the charges,
but Marquez hasn't been able to get back the job he'd held for 14
years.</TE>
<TE>   Not all those who have gotten into trouble were immigrants.</TE>
<TE>   Rick Baer, a veteran firefighter and emergency preparedness
trainer at the Norfolk, Va., airport, was fired for allegedly failing
to disclose on a security form a 10-year-old misdemeanor conviction.
He said it stemmed from a time he waved a handgun at trespassers near
his home in a high-crime area. Baer said he never kept the incident a
secret from his co-workers and supervisors at the airport. A federal
judge dismissed the charge, but prosecutors are appealing.</TE>
<TE>   "They have attacked American citizens because they can't find
anybody else to arrest or investigate," Baer said.</TE>
<TE>   Federal officials say the sweeps are needed to protect travelers.</TE>
<TE>   The investigations have helped solve some crimes. Last month in
Philadelphia, a baggage handler was arrested for not disclosing
previous felony convictions that would have disqualified him from
working at the airport. When authorities searched his bedroom, they
found two handguns that had been stolen from checked luggage
belonging to a Customs agent and a Phoenix police officer.</TE>
<TE>   If a felon can get an airport job, a terrorist operative could do
the same -- and use his security badge to gain access to planes, law
enforcement officials said.</TE>
<TE>   "We have to make sure individuals in these security-sensitive
areas are who they say they are," said Jorge Martinez, a Justice
Department spokesman. "I'm sure no one wants another terrorist
attack."</TE>
<TE>   Keeping terrorists out "is not at all in question," said Susan
Alva, executive director of the Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights
in Los Angeles. But she objects to arresting undocumented immigrants
who have no other violations.</TE>
<TE>   "These arrests are more damaging to the individual than the good
the government is trying to accomplish," Alva said.</TE>
<TE>   The government says it cannot simply ignore immigration
violations. "So when did we get to a point that it's a good thing not
to enforce our laws?" Martinez asked.</TE>
<TE>   With 25 of 429 airports targeted so far, the debate and the sweeps
are continuing.</TE>
<TE>   Mixed Feelings</TE>
<TE>   Within law enforcement, there are mixed feelings. Former federal
prosecutor Henri Sisneros left his job with the Salt Lake City U.S.
attorney because he strongly disagreed with Operation Tarmac.</TE>
<TE>   "I believe that you've got to secure the airports, but I took
issue with the means," said Sisneros, now a federal public defender.
"This was far disproportionate to any crime that these people had
committed.... They are picking on the weakest of the weak."</TE>
<TE>   Undocumented workers should not be singled out for harsher
treatment because they hold airport jobs, said Cathal Flynn, a former
Federal Aviation Administration security chief.</TE>
<TE>   "If they are otherwise law-abiding I don't think the penalty
should be harsher than if they are found working at Macy's," Flynn
said.</TE>
<TE>   Otherwise law-abiding employees should be given an opportunity to
resolve their immigration problems, Sisneros said. He opposes felony
charges that could subject even those who are legal residents to
deportation and exclusion.</TE>
<TE>   "These people are enmeshed in American life," Sisneros said. "The
practical effect of the prosecution is to give them a lifetime ban
from this country."</TE>
<TE>   In Los Angeles, federal prosecutors originally filed felony counts
against the detainees. After a meeting with Latino community groups
and an internal review, prosecutors reduced most of the defendants'
charges to misdemeanors.</TE>
<TE>   "Our meeting with them confirmed in our minds that it was the
appropriate thing to do," said Assistant U.S. Atty. George Cardona.
"I think we would have probably come out the same way."</TE>
<TE>   About 40,000 people work at Los Angeles-area airports, and for the
few arrested last August the consequences have been severe.</TE>
<TE>   Barrera, the mother of three who gave birth in custody, said she
cries when she remembers her detention. She was picked up Aug. 22 on
state charges in conjunction with the federal roundup.</TE>
<TE>   "I feel that I am in a very strong depression," Barrera said.
"When I recall it, I feel a knot in my throat."</TE>
<TE>   Barrera, 30, said she had left her minimum-wage airport job nearly
a year before the authorities noticed her. The Thursday morning of
her arrest, she walked her 8-year-old son, Edson, to his school bus.
When Barrera returned home, the police were waiting.</TE>
<TE>   "I said, 'What's this all about?' " she recalled. "They responded,
'Did you work at the airport?' "</TE>
<TE>   Barrera's due date was not for another two weeks, but she
unexpectedly went into labor two days after being jailed.</TE>
<TE>   Her lawyer, Luis Carrillo, said he found a technical error in the
complaint, and Orange County prosecutors dropped the charge. Barrera
was reunited with baby daughter, Alondra, and her two older children,
but she said her son Edson is now afraid to leave her side.</TE>
<TE>   Marquez, the catering truck driver at LAX, said his problems began
when he got a letter asking him to attend a security seminar Aug. 22.
He arrived, filled out some forms and was ushered into a room.</TE>
<TE>   "Six federal agents jumped me and shoved me against the wall,"
said Marquez, 46. "I didn't know what was going on. They handcuffed
me and started interrogating me."</TE>
<TE>   Marquez and his wife, Los Angeles residents for 21 years, have
raised three children. Marquez came as an undocumented immigrant from
Ecuador, but he obtained amnesty and became a U.S. citizen in 1999.</TE>
<TE>   When he first started working, Marquez said he used a false Social
Security number. He received a valid number after becoming a citizen.
But his employer would not allow him to use the valid number, he
said. The same employer has now fired him.</TE>
<TE>   "They have broken me in pieces," Marquez said. "The federal
authorities are the maximum authorities in the world. With a few
computer keystrokes, they can tell whether a person is a terrorist or
a criminal. This could have been handled in another way."</TE>
<TE>   Asked about Marquez' case, prosecutor Cardona responded: "That is
not the kind of guy we want to go after."</TE>

<HD>Wind Gusts Overpower Crews in New England</HD>
<DH>Power is on and off as ice-coated trees down more lines
even as others are repaired.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>TORRINGTON, Conn.</DL>
<LD>Gusting winds sent ice-weakened trees crashing down across New
England on Monday, frustrating crews as they worked to restore power
to thousands of darkened homes after a weekend northeaster.</LD>
<LD>   Schools were closed in parts of the region, and two highway deaths
were blamed on icy conditions in Maine. In Connecticut, Massachusetts
and New York, thousands of residents were still without electrical
power Monday evening as utility crews, their chain saws and wood
chippers buzzing, worked to clear downed trees.</LD>
<LD>   The northeaster swept into the region Sunday, bringing a mix of
snow and freezing rain and leaving a coating of ice in its wake.
Residents in Connecticut described a frightening two days filled with
the constant crack of falling trees covered with more than an inch of
ice.</LD>
<TE>   "It looks like a bomb hit," said Nick Huebsch, 45, of Torrington.
"They said I won't have power for another couple of days."</TE>
<TE>   More than 130,000 customers of Connecticut Light &amp; Power lost
electricity during the storm, and at 9 p.m. Monday, more than 35,000
outages remained. The number fluctuated during the day as winds
knocked down transmission lines.</TE>
<TE>   More than 250 utility crews and 100 tree-cutting crews, some from
as far away as New Jersey and New Hampshire, were expected to work
through today, said Chris Riley, a CL&amp;P spokesman. Dozens of
Connecticut schools were closed Monday.</TE>
<TE>   Shelters remained open as many residents prepared to spend a
second night without electricity. For thousands in the state's rural
northwest hills, that also meant another night without water, because
electric well pumps remained inoperable.</TE>
<TE>   Ruth Sweykoski, 83, hunkered down at one of two shelters in
Torrington.</TE>
<TE>   "I had to leave my home; it was too cold," Sweykoski said.
"Everything was off and the furnace runs on electricity."</TE>
<TE>   In Massachusetts, workers had almost finished restoring power when
the winds hit during the day, leaving 18,000 Massachusetts Electric
customers without service again. Workers had managed to cut that
number to 3,800 by Monday evening.</TE>
<TE>   "The storm really did a number on us," utility spokeswoman Amy
Atwood said. "As soon as we'd restore power to one area, then the
power would go out in another area, so we'd have to dispatch the
crews."</TE>
<TE>   In New York, meanwhile, about 15,000 customers of New York State
Electric &amp; Gas lost power, including 10,000 in the Catskills
community of Liberty, NYSEG spokesman Clay Ellis said. Some were not
expected to have power until Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   Thousands more residents elsewhere in the state lost power during
the storm, but most of those problems were expected to be cleaned up
Monday night, utility officials said. The same was true in Maine,
where only a couple of hundred homes remained without electricity.</TE>
<TE>   Sunday's storm formed along the coast of the Carolinas and rolled
northward, producing rain from the Carolinas into southern New
England, where colder air turned the rain to snow and ice.</TE>
<TE>   The cold front extended all the way into Florida, where
temperatures dipped into the freezing range early Monday in some
northern counties. The cold snap was expected to continue Monday
night, with more seasonable temperatures returning today.</TE>

<HD>Dykstra's Care Under Scrutiny</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Lance Pugmire</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The attorney representing the family of Rollie Dykstra said Monday
that the injured University of La Verne quarterback was deprived of
adequate emergency care after collapsing during a game, and had
experienced pregame symptoms indicating previous head trauma.</LD>
<LD>   Dykstra suffered a severe head injury during the second quarter of
a game against Redlands on Oct. 19.</LD>
<LD>   Martin Cervantes, an Ontario-based attorney, said the La Verne
trainer, team doctor and two private emergency medical technicians
who first treated Dykstra struggled to keep him breathing after his
jaw locked during a seizure. Cervantes said they lacked equipment to
open the jaw and that paramedics summoned had to break at least two
of Dykstra's teeth to establish an airway.</LD>
<TE>   Cervantes also said he has interviewed a La Verne player who
reported Dykstra vomited and was sweating profusely less than 90
minutes before the game.</TE>
<TE>   Dykstra's father, Roland Dykstra Sr., and girlfriend, Jennifer
Ross, have said the 24-year-old senior complained of severe headaches
for two weeks before the game, possibly the result of a previous
concussion.</TE>
<TE>   The Dykstra family has not filed a negligence claim against La
Verne, but Cervantes said, "We certainly have enough to proceed, the
basis is there."</TE>
<TE>   Cervantes reviewed a video tape of the episode during the weekend
and described the second-quarter tackle that felled Dykstra as
"garden variety."</TE>
<TE>   A university representative and the attorney for the school
declined to comment.</TE>
<TE>   Dykstra emerged from a coma last week, but he remains in serious
condition at Loma Linda University Medical Center Rehabilitation
Institute.</TE>

<HD>Hampton Deal Is Complex for Quite a Few Reasons</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Ross Newhan</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Let's see if I have this right: the Florida Marlins will basically
subsidize Mike Hampton's attempt to regain his pre-Coors Field form
with their division rival Atlanta Braves.</LD>
<LD>   Whether Hampton, a $121-million bust in two years with the
Colorado Rockies, can do it is uncertain, but it will cost the Braves
comparatively little to find out.</LD>
<LD>   In agreeing to pay the bulk of Hampton's salary over the next
three years to facilitate a complex trade involving eight players,
three teams and the approval of Commissioner Bud Selig, the Marlins
may have also provided the Braves with enough financial flexibility
to retain free agents Tom Glavine or Greg Maddux, maybe both.</LD>
<TE>   "We could not and would not have made this trade without
substantial financial help from another club," Atlanta General
Manager John Schuerholz said by phone. "It was too rich in its
original form. Our 2003 budget could not have handled it."</TE>
<TE>   The Braves are obligated to pay Hampton $48.5 million over the
remaining six years of his contract, but only $5.5 million in the
first three years.</TE>
<TE>   The Marlins, who would have preferred to backload their financial
responsibility to free payroll for seven key players eligible for
arbitration, were so desperate to dump the $54.3 million remaining on
the contracts of Preston Wilson and Charles Johnson without taking on
equivalent salary in return that they agreed to pay Atlanta $30
million over the next three years. Of that $30 million, $6.5 million
is coming from the Rockies, who in turn will have paid $49 million of
Hampton's $121-million contract but will now save about $22.3 million
over the remaining six years of the contract.</TE>
<TE>   This is the way the deal came down:</TE>
<TE>   * The Rockies, who only two years ago invested almost $200 million
in Hampton and Denny Neagle and have changed philosophy and direction
each of their three years under General Manager Dan O'Dowd, traded
Hampton and center fielder Juan Pierre to Florida for Wilson,
Johnson, left-handed reliever Vic Darensbourg and second base
prospect Pedro Ozuna.</TE>
<TE>   * The Marlins then traded Hampton to the Braves for relief pitcher
Tim Spooneybarger and minor league reliever Ryan Baker.</TE>
<TE>   Hampton might not have waived his no-trade clause if Miami had
been his final destination. He wanted to pitch for a contender, a
case of unmitigated gall in the sense that Colorado had obligated to
pay him millions of dollars to help them become a contender.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, he was 21-38 in two years, and now the Braves hope he can
emulate Darryl Kile's 20-win success in the season after he left
Coors.</TE>
<TE>   "We've all seen the data on pitchers before Coors, during Coors
and after Coors," Schuerholz said. "Our reports indicate Hampton's
athleticism and arm action are as good as they were when he was
winning regularly. He's only 30. We think he can be the same pitcher"
who went 22-4 with Houston in 1999 and 15-10 with the New York Mets
in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   With Atlanta obligated to pay only $2 million of his salary in
2003 (and with the possibility that the Braves could trade him after
a three-year outlay of only $5 million if he doesn't regain his
form), Schuerholz acknowledged that the potential re-signing of
Glavine and Maddux is more feasible.</TE>
<TE>   "We'll keep the dialogue going and see what happens," he said.
"There are so many uncertainties in this free-agent market that you
never know what's around the next corner."</TE>
<TE>   With agent Scott Boras doing the driving, the next corner may take
Maddux into a five-year, $75-million neighborhood that is too costly
for the Braves. Glavine, however, is another matter.</TE>
<TE>   In the face of a three-year, $27-million offer from Philadelphia
and a three-year, $31-million offer from the Mets, the Braves on
Friday improved their initial one-year, $9-million offer to the
veteran left-hander, going to two years at $9.5 million per year,
according to sources, with a $10 million option vesting in 2005 if he
pitches 225 innings in the second year.</TE>
<TE>   It is suspected Glavine will return once Atlanta guarantees the
third year.</TE>
<TE>   Meantime, there was so much money changing hands in the Hampton
deal that it took Selig's approval in consultation with Sandy
Alderson, his executive vice president for baseball operations, and
Rob Mansfred, his lead labor lawyer.</TE>
<TE>   Selig admitted that he was concerned about the dollars that were
involved and the perception that the Marlins are basically paying
Hampton's salary while he pitches for the Braves, but otherwise
refused comment.</TE>
<TE>   A source familiar with the decision, however, said that the
Marlins and Rockies "were so desperate for financial relief and so
insistent on the trade being approved" that "Bud didn't feel he had a
choice."</TE>
<TE>   For the Rockies, trading Hampton and switching back to an emphasis
on power (with the acquisition of Wilson) after switching from power
to speed in O'Dowd's first of three seasons (and makeovers) as the
GM, the trade may be only the first of several blockbusters.</TE>
<TE>   The Rockies are next likely to deal Larry Walker to Arizona for
Matt Williams, Erubiel Durazo, Dave Dellucci and Bret Prinz,
providing they don't first move Neagle to the Mets for Jeromy Burnitz
and Rey Ordonez.</TE>
<TE>   "There's no question we've bounced around a little," a source
close to O'Dowd said, referring to the Rockies' recent direction.
"There's a learning curve involved in Coors, and I think Dan realizes
now that you have to have power to survive here."</TE>
<TE>   Wilson slugged 31 homers, drove in 121 runs and stole 36 bases for
the Marlins in 2000, but his production has dropped significantly in
the last two years. If O'Dowd does all he wants to do, Wilson would
play center with Jay Payton in left and Burnitz in right, and Coors
might prove to be the elixir it is for most hitters.</TE>
<TE>   For Hampton, it was something else.</TE>
<TE>   Hitters batted .313 against him, the highest opponents' average in
the National League. Now, he is Atlanta's reclamation project -- but
at least the Marlins are paying for it.</TE>

<HD>Orosco, Padres Near a Deal</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Dodgers are on the verge of losing one of their best antidotes to
San Francisco Giant slugger Barry Bonds -- free-agent reliever Jesse
Orosco is close to signing a one-year deal with the San Diego Padres.</LD>
<LD>   Orosco, the 45-year-old left-hander who spent the last two seasons
in Los Angeles, has held Bonds to four hits in 25 at-bats for a .160
average. Bonds has two homers, two walks and nine strikeouts against
Orosco.</LD>
<LD>   Unless the Dodgers have a significant change of heart and decide
to counter the Padre offer, Orosco will pitch next season in San
Diego, about five miles from his home.</LD>
<TE>   "Over the weekend, I received a substantial offer from the Padres,
with a guaranteed contract, a spot on the 40-man roster and a promise
not to trade Jesse without his consent," said Alan Meersand, Orosco's
agent. "The way I see it, this is 99% done."</TE>
<TE>   Meersand declined to go into specifics of the offer, but it is
thought to be worth about $1 million. Orosco, who made $800,000 on a
non-guaranteed contract last season, went 1-2 with a 3.00 earned-run
average in 56 games for the Dodgers, striking out 22 and walking 12
in 27 innings.</TE>
<TE>   The short-relief specialist limited opposing hitters to a .229
average; left-handers hit .238 against him, and right-handers hit
.214. He has an 85-78 record and 3.04 ERA in 1,187 games over 22
seasons.</TE>
<TE>   Because he is a Type C free agent, the Dodgers would not receive
any draft-pick compensation if Orosco signs elsewhere.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers have expressed interest in Japanese reliever Takashi
Saito, and a team representative plans to fly to Japan to meet with
the agent for the 33-year-old right-hander this weekend.</TE>
<TE>   Saito, who made $1.5 million with the Yokohama Bay Stars last
season, has a 93-mph fastball. The former starting pitcher was
converted into a reliever in 2001 and has a 76-64 record with a 3.62
earned-run average and 48 saves.</TE>
<TE>   Saito is a free agent, so U.S. teams do not have to go through a
bidding process to secure negotiating rights with him.</TE>
<TE>   -- Mike DiGiovanna</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Kansas City waived shortstop Neifi Perez, clearing the way for
Angel Berroa to take over the job next season.... Detroit agreed to a
minor league contract with catcher Matt Walbeck.... Left-handed
reliever Juan Alvarez was released by Texas.... Oakland signed
pitcher Jose Silva, catcher Mitch Meluskey, first baseman David
McCarty and outfielder Billy McMillon to minor league contracts.</TE>

<HD>Gentry Says Pressing May Be an Issue</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Elliott Teaford</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>OAKLAND</DL>
<LD>Coach Alvin Gentry said Monday he doesn't believe point guard Andre
Miller is pressing, forcing the issue to make things happen for the
Clippers. Well, not Miller specifically, anyway.</LD>
<LD>   "All these guys want to do well," Gentry said before the team
played the Golden State Warriors. "In general, our team has reached a
point where we want to win so badly that we start pressing."</LD>
<LD>   Gentry's message to his players (and reporters) after the Clippers
let a 15-point lead late in the third quarter slip away in Sunday's
84-78 loss to the Seattle SuperSonics was simple: Relax and have fun.</LD>
<TE>   The Clippers looked anything but relaxed down the stretch against
Seattle. They certainly didn't have any fun after their seventh loss
in 10 games to start the season.</TE>
<TE>   Miller had a poor shooting game, missing 15 of 19 shots and four
of seven free throws en route to scoring 12 points (with six assists)
in 46 minutes. He missed two late free throws that would have helped
to slow the Clippers' fourth-quarter slide. The Clippers were
outscored, 30-14, in the fourth quarter.</TE>
<TE>   "I think this team is going to be a good team," Gentry said.
"We're going to play ourselves out of this. We can't talk about
making sweeping changes. We've got to understand that we can play
through this and be a good team. We can't make any excuses because we
don't have any excuses. We've got play better."</TE>

<TE>   Quentin Richardson is eligible to come off the injured list today,
although it remains to be seen if he will be activated in time for
Wednesday's game against the Sacramento Kings.</TE>
<TE>   He bruised his right knee Nov. 8 during the Clippers' loss to the
New Jersey Nets. He also sprained his right knee Oct. 4 while doing
wind sprints. He hyperextended it during the Clippers' victory Nov. 3
against the Detroit Pistons.</TE>

<LD>Miami moved back atop the bowl championship series rankings Monday --
but barely.</LD>
<LD>   The defending national champion Hurricanes inched ahead of Ohio
State, which needed overtime to beat Illinois, 23-16, Saturday. Miami
(9-0) has 3.69 points,0.01 of a point ahead of Ohio State (12-0). The
top two BCS teams have never been closer. Washington State (9-1) is
third with 9.11.</LD>

<TE>   The NCAA upheld California's one-year bowl ban, but restored nine
scholarships it had revoked in June after an investigation into
academic fraud and other infractions. First-year Coach Jeff Tedford
said Cal players were being punished for multiple misdeeds committed
under his predecessor, Tom Holmoe. In restoring the scholarships, the
NCAA said its original sanctions were excessive for an array of minor
violations.</TE>

<TE>   Tennessee quarterback Casey Clausen returned to practice after a
week off and was optimistic he would be able to play Saturday against
Vanderbilt. Clausen sprained his right foot and ankle Nov. 9 against
Miami. .... Florida's leading receiver, junior Carlos Perez, had
surgery on his broken right leg and will begin rehabilitation in four
weeks.... Wisconsin's standout receiver, Lee Evans, will have knee
surgery this week and is expected to take six months to recover. It
will be the second surgery for Evans, who has been sidelined all
season. He led the Big Ten in receiving last year.... Wyoming fired
Coach Vic Koenning, 42, with the team struggling at 2-9 and one game
left on the schedule. Koenning, who is 5-28 in three seasons, will
coach the Cowboys' finale at New Mexico on Nov. 30....Austin Peay
fired Coach Bill Schmitz, who was 19-46 with the Governors in six
seasons. The team finished 7-5 this year, its first winning season
since 1984.</TE>

<LD>With an assist from USC Athletic Director Mike Garrett, the Sherman
Oaks Notre Dame High marching band is expected to keep alive a
20-year tradition of serving as the pep band for the University of
Notre Dame in its football games against USC at the Coliseum.</LD>
<LD>   This year's appearance by the band for the Nov. 30 game was
canceled last week after the university's compliance officer
determined that a new NCAA rule, which went into effect in August,
makes it illegal for Notre Dame to invite the band.</LD>
<LD>   The new rule does not specifically allow visiting teams to hire
bands for regular-season away games.</LD>
<TE>   However, Garrett has decided "it would be appropriate" to have the
band play at the game and will make the phone call today to invite
them on behalf of USC, school spokesman Tim Tessalone said.</TE>
<TE>   "The stipulation is they have to wear Cardinal T-shirts and play
'Fight On' at least three times," Tessalone said jokingly.</TE>
<TE>   The band's director, John Combes, said that if invited the band
would accept.</TE>
<TE>   Ironically, the NCAA amendment was designed to create more
opportunities for bands.</TE>

<HD>Crenshaw Is Taking Cues From Mebane</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Eric Stephens</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Walter and Joyce Mebane taught their four children many values. One
of the most important character traits they instilled was taking
responsibility for one's actions.</LD>
<LD>   In the Mebane household, youngest child Brandon learned it one day
while throwing a football in front of the house.</LD>
<LD>   "We had a Ford Aerostar van back then and it was parked in front,"
Joyce said. "Walter had been working with Brandon on throwing the
ball. He told Brandon to always throw the ball overhanded but Brandon
would like throw it underhanded sometimes.</LD>
<TE>   "Well, [Brandon] threw the ball and broke the car window. Walter
heard it and went outside. Brandon was looking all scared. Walter
calmly said, 'Son, did you throw the ball overhanded?' Brandon said
no. And then he just came inside, got the broom and cleaned it up.
And that was that."</TE>
<TE>   Brandon Mebane is one of the leaders of the Crenshaw football team
that is playing Fairfax on Thursday in the first round of the City
Section playoffs. The senior defensive lineman is one of the
section's best players and is likely to wind up on the roster of a
Pacific 10 Conference team.</TE>
<TE>   The Cougars have one of the most physical defenses in the section.
Linebackers Solomon Eliminian and Aaron Hutley are big and fast and
defensive linemen Kristian Thompson and Scott Cook have been making
regular appearances in the opposing backfield.</TE>
<TE>   But their cue comes from Mebane, a 6-foot-1, 260-pound terror
equally adept at stopping running backs and chasing down
quarterbacks. In a 28-21 victory over then-undefeated Fremont three
weeks ago, Mebane sacked elusive Pathfinder quarterback Michael Beach
on the game's first play and the Cougar defense controlled a
high-scoring Fremont offensive attack.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of times the offense may not be doing so well and we as a
defensive unit have to be the ones to not make any errors and stop
teams from scoring," Mebane said. "Defense wins games. If we play
hard every play and give 100% as a team, we'll be successful."</TE>
<TE>   Mebane is in an enviable position for a high school football
player. He is taking a trip to California on Saturday and is deciding
on the other recruiting trips. USC, UCLA, Oregon, Washington, Arizona
and Oregon State have all made scholarship offers.</TE>
<TE>   Mebane's diligence in the classroom made it easy to lure the
attention of recruiters. He finished his junior year with a 3.5
grade-point average and has scored 980 on the SAT. Those numbers can
be just as good as the 4.7 clocking in the 40-yard dash.</TE>
<TE>   Mebane said he knows similarly talented players who didn't pan out
because they didn't follow through in their studies.</TE>
<TE>   "I talk to them, ask them questions and learn from their
mistakes," he said. "Academics come first, then sports. My parents
prefer that I graduate and get my degree and then think about going
to the NFL."</TE>
<TE>   Joyce said her son is simply fulfilling his responsibilities.</TE>
<TE>   "My kids have always known that they had to get good grades in
order to play sports," she said. "An education is important for them,
especially in this day and age. Back when I was going to school, you
could get a decent job coming out of high school and you didn't have
to go to college.</TE>
<TE>   "Nowadays, you need at least a degree for a good job, especially
if you're a young black male. I'm glad that their dad and I took a
strong stand on getting an education."</TE>
<TE>   The Mebanes have always put religion and their family first. Which
provide stability that their youngsters can lean on.</TE>
<TE>   The support structure extends to the field. Walter Mebane Jr.,
Brandon's older brother, was an All-City Section lineman at Crenshaw
two years ago and played in the 1999 championship game against
Carson.</TE>
<TE>   Walter, who is a freshman at L.A. Southwest College, routinely
tapes his brother's games and offers constructive criticism. It is a
close relationship and football is an integral part of that.</TE>
<TE>   "I've always looked up to my brother," Mebane said. "He always
tells me to look at this year like it's my freshman year in college.
Try different things, don't do the same thing on every play."</TE>
<TE>   Now Brandon Mebane hopes to put the Cougars in the same position
that his brother did three years ago. It is his responsibility. It is
the team's responsibility.</TE>
<TE>   "It's all about team ball and doing whatever it takes to win," he
said. "Football is not a one-man sport. Golf is. In football, you
have to work together. That's a must."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   No game had more impact on the playoff seedings than Woodland
Hills Taft's 30-6 victory over Lake Balboa Birmingham.</TE>
<TE>   The Patriots, seeded sixth as the West Valley League runner-up,
probably would have been seeded first with a victory, but a runner-up
can be seeded no higher than fifth. The Toreadors, finalists last
season, were seeded first.</TE>
<TE>   Birmingham may have the toughest road with a potential
quarterfinal matchup against Crenshaw on the road. Assuming the
Patriots get by Van Nuys Grant in the first round and then the
Cougars, they could face second-seeded Carson in the semifinals.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a tough bracket," Birmingham Coach Ed Croson said. "We just
have to play whoever is put there ahead of us."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Taft receiver Steve Smith moved into second place on the state's
all-time receptions list with 237. Smith caught eight passes against
Birmingham to move past James Dunn, who had 230 for Santa Monica St.
Monica from 1996-98.</TE>
<TE>   Former Newbury Park star Leodes Van Buren holds the state record
with 269 from 1990-93.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   City top 10: 1. Taft (10-0); 2. Carson (8-2); 3. Venice (8-2); 4.
Crenshaw (7-3); 5. Birmingham (7-3); 6. Roosevelt (9-1); 7. Franklin

<LD>Sprinter Allyson Felix of North Hills L.A. Baptist and jumper
Michelle Sanford of Irvine Woodbridge, who have won a combined five
state titles in track and field, signed letters of intent with USC on
Monday.</LD>
<LD>   Dominique Dorsey of Long Beach Poly, the third-place finisher in
the girls' 200 meters in the state championships in June, has also
signed with USC.</LD>
<LD>   Felix, the two-time defending state champion in the 100 and
defending champion in the 200, chose USC over South Carolina.
Sanford, the defending state champion in the triple jump and the 2000
champion in the long jump, chose USC over California and Houston.</LD>
<TE>   Felix's brother Wes is a sophomore sprinter at USC, but she said
that didn't play a big role in her decision.</TE>
<TE>   "I just wanted a balanced program between academics and
athletics," she said. "And I have a lot of confidence that Coach
[Ron] Allice and Coach [Tina] Fernandez can take me where I want to
be."</TE>
<TE>   Sanford, the daughter of former USC sprinter James Sanford, has
dropped basketball to train for track during the winter.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm going to be doing all kinds of bounding drills and training
that I've never been able to do before," she said.</TE>

<HD>Golf Title for Dos Pueblos</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Steve Galluzzo</AU>
<BD>From Staff Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The thought didn't even cross Doug Mitchell's mind until about a
month ago, and even as early as Monday morning he doubted his Goleta
Dos Pueblos girls' golf team could win the Southern Section team
title.</LD>
<LD>   But the Chargers, without a star or a senior, made a believer of
their coach Monday at Las Posas Country Club in Camarillo when they
shot 441 in difficult conditions and won the title by four shots over
Rolling Hills Estates Peninsula.</LD>
<LD>   Anaheim Esperanza shot 450 and finished third and Camarillo, which
played several home matches at Las Posas, finished fourth with 451.</LD>
<TE>   The top four advance to the CIF-WSCGA finals on Dec. 3 at the SCGA
Members Club in Murrieta.</TE>
<TE>   Maggie Kim led the way with a 16-over-par 87 for Dos Pueblos, but
the key to the victory was depth.</TE>
<TE>   Nicole Dishman, Sara Ovada and Amber Clifford each shot 88 and
Sumika Sim shot 90 on a windblown course with fairways so tight, Palm
Desert Coach Jack Stewart said, "there are a couple of places where
you have to walk single file."</TE>
<TE>   Dos Pueblos finished second in its first tournament this year but
has won everything else since. The Chargers broke 200 twice this
season in nine-hole matches, including a 188 Oct. 23.</TE>
<TE>   "That's when I knew we had something here," Mitchell said. "This
was supposed to be a rebuilding year for us. I thought we'd be
competitive, but not this good."</TE>
<TE>   Peninsula Coach Bob Wilton was scratching his head trying to
figure out how his team came within four shots of winning when four
of his players failed to break 90. Shannon Yocum shot 81 and Annika
Windon shot 83 to lead Peninsula.</TE>
<TE>   "I figured we were a done deal," Wilton said. "I didn't think were
were going to make it, but we're thrilled to death."</TE>
<TE>   Others weren't as joyful. Long Beach Wilson shot 452 and missed
advancing by one stroke. Last year, the Bruins finished second in the
section finals -- by one stroke.</TE>
<TE>   The disappointment was deeper for Torrance, which shot 455 and
finished sixth. Maria Ham, the No. 2 player for Torrance, withdrew
after 12 holes because of illness.</TE>
<TE>   Coach John Wurzer said Ham, who averaged 38 for nine holes during
the regular season, was 17-over-par through 12 holes -- on pace for a
97. Had Ham finished with a 92, Torrance would have won. Had she shot
102, Torrance would have advanced.</TE>
<TE>   -- Peter Yoon</TE>
<TE>   For the fourth consecutive year, Carson and Granada Hills will
play for the City Section girls' tennis championship.</TE>
<TE>   Top-seeded Granada Hills lost four games in 14 sets en route to a
7-0 victory over fifth-seeded Westchester (12-4) in the first of two
semifinals at Balboa Tennis Center in Encino. The Highlanders (15-0),
who reached the finals for the fifth consecutive year but only have
one title in that time, have not lost a set in the playoffs.</TE>
<TE>   "For us to win it's going to take a whole team effort," said
Highlander No. 1 singles player Christine Dao. "I think if we play
our best, we can do it."</TE>
<TE>   Dao blanked Westchester's Monika Brackett, 6-0, 6-0, while
teammates Tracey Takeshita and Maria Cardenas won by an identical
score at No. 1 doubles.</TE>
<TE>   Third-seeded Carson was almost as impressive in its 5-2 victory
over second-seeded Palisades, winning the first five matches before
the Dolphins (14-1) won two three-setters. The defending champion
Colts (15-0) have won 47 consecutive matches over three seasons.</TE>
<TE>   The finals are 1 p.m. Friday at Balboa Tennis Center.</TE>

<LD>If Thomas Herring were to suit up in an Oakland Raider uniform and
stand side by side with NFL players, no one would be able to tell he
was an impostor.</LD>
<LD>   "He looks like an NFL guy right now," Los Angeles Fremont Coach
Pete Duffy said.</LD>
<LD>   Not only does Herring pass the eyeball test, he'd also inspire
sportscaster Dick Enberg to say "oh my" just watching him run on a
football field.</LD>
<TE>   Herring is 6 feet 7 and 290 pounds. Lots of mouths were agape a
couple of weeks ago when Herring caught a short pass over the middle
and ran 65 yards for a touchdown against Crenshaw.</TE>
<TE>   "Have you ever seen anyone that big run that fast?" Duffy said.
"It's unbelievable."</TE>
<TE>   Herring resembles a cartoon superhero dressed in his tight-fitting
Fremont uniform. He's a 17-year-old junior who plays tight end and
defensive end and is used to people staring. They're startled by his
size and agility.</TE>
<TE>   "They think it's amazing," he said. "Some people say they're not
intimidated, but I know they are."</TE>
<TE>   Who wouldn't be taken aback by a teenager with the kind of
physical stature that motivates many to make bold predictions for his
future.</TE>
<TE>   He's still learning what is required to succeed in football. There
are times when he dominates as a pass rusher. There are also times he
disappears. Duffy's challenge is to motivate Herring to perform
effectively on a consistent basis.</TE>
<TE>   "It's typical of kids playing both ways that haven't figured out
what playing hard every play means," Duffy said. "It's what separates
the great ones."</TE>
<TE>   Herring appreciates high expectations and wants to fulfill them.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of teams don't run the ball to my side and it's
frustrating," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Herring considered himself a basketball player when he first came
to high school, but he added, "I take football a lot more seriously."</TE>
<TE>   Duffy projects him to be an offensive lineman in college, although
Herring said, "I don't have that mind-set to be an offensive tackle.
But if I need to be one, I will."</TE>
<TE>   The luckiest people are Herring's brother and sister, who are
10-year-old twins. They can climb together on Herring's back and get
a piggy-back ride.</TE>
<TE>   "They're pretty light," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Even Duffy might want to hop on Herring's back if Fremont (8-2)
were to win the City Championship. Herring would have no trouble
carrying Duffy or anyone else.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Another player who attracts attention when he walks into a room is
6-5, 290-pound offensive tackle Aleksey Lanis of Crenshaw. He's a
16-year-old sophomore in his first year of tackle football. But what
a player he has become.</TE>
<TE>   With Lanis providing effective pass blocking, Crenshaw (7-3) won
the Coliseum League and is seeded No. 3 in the City Championship
playoffs that begin Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   He's a straight-A student enrolled in Crenshaw's gifted magnet
program. He lived in Siberia until coming to the United States when
he was 8. He's a fast learner, picking up English and football in
rapid fashion. "I can do something the first time and I can remember
it," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Teammates have teased him about his Russian background, calling
him "Ivan Drago" from Rocky IV.</TE>
<TE>   He is a probable top college prospect because he has barely lifted
weights and already has the strength and aggressiveness to hold his
own in line battles.</TE>
<TE>   "My coach wants me to be able to play all three positions on the
line," Lanis said.</TE>
<TE>   Lanis doesn't miss Siberia and its cold weather.</TE>
<TE>   "In winter, I'd come home after school and spend all day in snow,"
he said. "It stayed about 40 below zero."</TE>
<TE>   Lanis has his priorities all figured out.</TE>
<TE>   "School, football and my girlfriend -- that's all I have time
for," he said.</TE>

<HD>Ronning a Better Fit for Wild</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jerry Crowe</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>ST. PAUL, Minn.</DL>
<LD>Although he was traded to the Kings with about four weeks left in the
regular season, Cliff Ronning was the leading scorer for the
Nashville Predators last season. This season, he is the No. 2 scorer
for the Minnesota Wild.</LD>
<LD>   In between, the diminutive forward was a bust with the Kings.</LD>
<LD>   In 14 regular-season games, he scored one goal and five points. In
four playoff games against the Colorado Avalanche, he contributed one
assist.</LD>
<TE>   "When I look back, I think I was trying too hard, if that makes
sense," Ronning said Monday after practice in the Xcel Energy Center,
where the division-leading Wild will play the Kings tonight. "I
didn't just relax and play....</TE>
<TE>   "I wish I did play better there, but I really think I was still a
little bit in shock that I got traded from Nashville [within a week]
after playing in my 1,000th game. That's no excuse, but you're a
human being. It took me three weeks before I realized I'd already
played nine or 10 games and was waking up in a different place."</TE>
<TE>   Ronning indicated that he never felt comfortable with the Kings.</TE>
<TE>   "You're going into a team that was No. 1 when I got there over the
previous four months," he said. "No. 1 on the power play, No. 1 in
penalty killing, No. 1 overall, and sometimes you feel like you're
stepping on toes. I felt there were some guys sitting out that were
bitter in a way even before I got there."</TE>
<TE>   Traded to the Wild on draft day in June for a fourth-round pick --
the Kings were unwilling to pick up the $1.85-million club option on
his contract -- Ronning has thrived in his new surroundings.</TE>
<TE>   His 19 points include a goal and two assists in a 5-2 victory over
the Kings on Nov. 4 at Staples Center.</TE>
<TE>   "If he'd opened our eyes and played as well as he's playing right
now, we probably would have kept him," King Coach Andy Murray said.
"His salary is reasonable for the numbers he's putting up now; he's
probably underpaid on today's market value. But what he did for us,
we couldn't justify paying him that salary."</TE>

<TE>   Update -- Mikko Eloranta is expected to return to action for the
Kings after sitting out five games because of a sprained left knee.
Adam Deadmarsh will sit out for the third consecutive game after
suffering a concussion last Tuesday at Toronto. The Kings considered
sending Deadmarsh home, but the combative winger remains hopeful that
he can play in the trip finale Thursday night against the Blues at
St. Louis.</TE>

<HD>Fisher Can Finally Report Progress</HD>

<LD>Rather than coming along together, maybe Lakers Nos. 2 through 14
will straggle into the season one by one, a guard one night, a power
forward in Dallas, Shaquille O'Neal on Friday, Robert Horry in, say,
March.</LD>
<LD>   On Sunday night, in a game the Houston Rockets stole in the three
minutes Coach Phil Jackson rested Kobe Bryant, Derek Fisher might
have arrived.</LD>
<LD>   After 38 reasonably sound minutes, most of them spent defending
the elusive Steve Francis on one end, and shooting 15 times for a
season-high 17 points -- including his first three-pointer in 10 days
-- on the other, Fisher said he was pleased with his progress.</LD>
<TE>   It's the foot, of course. After two surgeries in two summers, it's
an afterthought and nothing more. So, Steve Francis one night becomes
Steve Nash the next, and Tony Parker the next, and Fisher can compete
again.</TE>
<TE>   Even when his shot is not falling -- before Sunday he was shooting
29.2% from the floor, 21.4% from the arc -- he said, "That's what I
can hang my hat on. I can play a hard, complete ballgame."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Olympic experience is the thing for Kobe Bryant, not the
coach. So, while O'Neal mulls his place on an international team
coached by someone other than Jackson -- and USA Basketball is
leaning toward Larry Brown -- Bryant is undaunted.</TE>
<TE>   "Me, I've always said I want to play in the Olympics," he said.
"I'd love to play in the Olympics. My plans don't change either way.
I'd love to have Phil be the coach, but Larry Brown's a good coach. I
respect him as a coach, always have."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   In training camp, Jackson divides scouting duties for the other 28
teams among his assistants, and the Dallas Mavericks fell to Frank
Hamblen.</TE>
<TE>   So, asked about the Mavericks on Monday afternoon, Jackson
shrugged.</TE>
<TE>   "I haven't watched them," he said. "It's Frank's team. I told him
we'd probably beat them, that's just the way things are in the
league. And he says we'll be lucky to be within 30 points."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers do not expect Devean George (ankle tendinitis) or Mark
Madsen (strained hamstring) to play on the two-game trip through
Dallas and San Antonio.</TE>

<HD>Kobe Stars as Reluctant Virtuoso</HD>
<DH>Bryant has been forced into some unusual habits by O'Neal's
absence, but he still expects teammates to deliver at some point.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Tim Brown</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Kobe Bryant had three stitches taken out of his mouth Monday, and he
couldn't wait to get to Dallas so he could get into a weight room,
and his eyes were bright enough to be taken for hopeful.</LD>
<LD>   This sudden phenomenon where his teammates can't make an open jump
shot is a bit wearing for him, and the defense, well, Yao Ming, for
crying out loud, and that's all he'd have to say about that. And, he
might be reluctant to admit it, but it seems the Dallas Mavericks
will win the NBA championship of November, they being 10-0, with the
3-7 and very vulnerable Lakers next up at American Airlines Center.
If they were the Sacramento Kings, they'd consider raising a banner.</LD>
<LD>   These are still the Lakers, half-game out of last place though
they may be. They often speak with the perspective of the last three
NBA titles.</LD>
<TE>   Recently, in the hallways of Staples Center, a visiting NBA coach
compared his raft of injuries to the Lakers'. The difference, he
said: "They've got the cavalry coming." So far, though, Bryant has
gone it largely alone.</TE>
<TE>   In 10 games of heavy lifting, Bryant leads the team in scoring,
rebounds, assists, steals, minutes, lip sutures, hammer dunks and
referee glares. He has taken three times as many shots as anyone
else.</TE>
<TE>   A tri-captain alongside one who has missed every game (Shaquille
O'Neal) and another who missed the first six (Rick Fox), Bryant has
scolded teammates and ignored them and challenged them privately and
publicly. He has passed to them without conscience and frozen them
out, all of them, for quarters at a time.</TE>
<TE>   The national media -- well, one judgmental soul -- buried him for
the 29 shots he took in the Lakers' first game, and Bryant has taken
37 or more three times since, without a care.</TE>
<TE>   Not only do his teammates not blame him for his aggression, Bryant
said, "I've gotten a couple of apologies."</TE>
<TE>   So they get where he's coming from? He laughed.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't really care that they understand how I feel," he said. "I
want them to knock down open shots. No, honestly, we'll be a much
better team because of this."</TE>
<TE>   Asked if he were disappointed in his teammates -- Brian Shaw is
the notable exception to the otherwise roster-wide shooting issues --
Bryant said, "I think we can play much better. We're not. Am I
disappointed? Yeah, I'm disappointed. But there's nothing I can do
about it, nothing we can do about it but move on to the next game and
try to enjoy playing. Just relax and shots will go down for us."</TE>
<TE>   With O'Neal aiming for a Friday return against Chicago at Staples
Center, it would seem there is no November problem that can't be
solved in December, January and February.</TE>
<TE>   If Bryant has alienated a teammate or two with his
make-a-jumper-or-stand-back crusade, it isn't evident, and he
probably wouldn't care. The man's leaving pieces of tooth on the
floor and in Antawn Jamison's scalp.</TE>
<TE>   Still, Bryant understands. It's not that he's forgotten the men
around him, he simply believes that it may not be their time.</TE>
<TE>   "This team is built to be able to play around Shaquille O'Neal,"
he said. "Outside of myself. I just kind of developed into my own a
little bit. But everybody here is orchestrated to play around the big
fella. That's why we're so good when he's here. Are we vulnerable now
that he's out? Absolutely. But when he gets back, all of a sudden the
people you look at as being vulnerable, now they're strengths. They
come to the forefront.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm just trying to do whatever it takes to keep us in ballgames.
If guys are hitting shots I'm going to keep going to them. If not,
obviously I have to be more aggressive to try to keep us in the
game."</TE>
<TE>   One gets the impression Coach Phil Jackson at times misses the old
triple-double Bryant, but doesn't have the heart to reel him back in,
either. After all, the 11 guys other than Bryant are shooting 37.6%,
including Shaw's 46.3% and Slava Medvedenko's 44.6%.</TE>
<TE>   "Kobe's trying to make us competitive," Jackson said. "But a lot
of guys are doing their job rebounding, trying to do the job
defensively, that process. Kobe, who went from being a playmaker
triple threat just a week ago, has really felt like he's had to
shoulder a lot of responsibility shooting the ball and scoring for
us. That's a whole different set of works there, because it makes it
difficult to play alongside of him, as a teammate."</TE>
<TE>   It seems Bryant won't worry about that. Before this season, they
were at least a .500 team in the games O'Neal missed. Now, they're
hovering just above the Golden State Warriors, Bryant with a handful
of guys who can't create their own shots, in an offense that by
definition is supposed to produce open shots.</TE>
<TE>   As he walked away on Monday afternoon, Bryant seemed inspired by
the whole thing. "I feel good," he said, grinning. "I feel like a
monster."</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>North Carolina men's basketball Coach Matt Doherty had reason to be
nervous after last season's 8-20 debacle. The Tar Heel freshmen
weren't the least bit jittery Monday night.</LD>
<LD>   Rashad McCants scored 28 points to set the freshman scoring mark
for an opening game and the Tar Heels rolled over Penn State, 85-55,
at Chapel Hill, N.C., in the first round of the preseason NIT.</LD>
<LD>   "It's been a long off-season and my insides were bursting,"
Doherty said. "I had no idea how we would do. I had no idea how Penn
State would do. I probably need to go run a marathon before games so
I can calm down a little bit."</LD>
<TE>   The Tar Heels, with only two seniors and no juniors on the roster,
made 10 of their first 12 shots and scored on 12 of their first 15
possessions to go up by 20 points after eight minutes.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   In other preseason NIT games, Josh Childress scored 22 points and
Stanford defeated Boston University, 61-57, at Stanford.... Romain
Sato scored 23 points and No. 11 Xavier defeated St. Peter's, 87-48,
at Cincinnati.... Henry Domercant scored 36 points, including 15 from
three-point range, to lead Eastern Illinois over Boise State, 73-59,
at Boise, Idaho.... Jerome Coleman scored 18 points and Rutgers
forced Columbia into 27 turnovers in a 60-36 victory at Piscataway,
N.J.</TE>

<TE>   USC junior guard Desmon Farmer will sit out the next two days of

<TE>   His absence, though excused, jeopardizes his place in the Trojans'
starting lineup Friday night at 7 in their season opener against UC
Riverside at the Sports Arena.</TE>
<TE>   Farmer was USC's top scorer in two exhibition games, averaging
20.5 points.</TE>

of Montclair Prep.</TE>
<TE>   Also signing letters of intent were 6-3 center Chloe Kerr of

<HD>Kings Plan to Stay the Course</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>While the Dallas Stars signed free agents Bill Guerin and Philippe
Boucher, who was leaving the Kings; the Phoenix Coyotes signed Tony
Amonte, the New York Rangers signed Bobby Holik and Darius
Kasparaitis, and the Mighty Ducks traded for Adam Oates and Petr
Sykora, the Kings kept a low profile last summer. They signed Chris
McAlpine and acquired Derek Armstrong and Erik Rasmussen, none of
whom is likely to set pulses racing.</LD>
<LD>   And although their depth has been strained by injuries to Jason
Allison, Aaron Miller, Ziggy Palffy and Adam Deadmarsh and they're
fighting for a spot among the top eight in the West, General Manager
Dave Taylor isn't panicking. As the Kings approach tonight's game in
Minnesota, the seventh in an eight-game, 17-day odyssey, Taylor said
he's not working on a blockbuster trade and sees no need to shake up
a team he acknowledged sometimes frustrates him.</LD>
<LD>   "The disappointing part for us recently is, we haven't been
consistent," he said. "It's still a little early and, obviously, we'd
like to be playing better and have more points than we have now, but
we've had a tough schedule.... Our guys compete hard. Certainly, if
there's an opportunity to improve our team and the player is a
long-term improvement, we'll consider it."</LD>
<TE>   Center Marc Savard, traded by Calgary to Atlanta last week for a
prospect, didn't fit that definition.</TE>
<TE>   "We talked about Marc and we like him as a player," Coach Andy
Murray said, "but we have a young guy who's small, Mike Cammalleri,
and he needs to play. It would have been bringing something we
already have."</TE>
<TE>   They haven't had consistent production from Palffy, whose
empty-net goal Saturday in Edmonton was his first goal since the
opener. Nor have they had the steady scoring from Bryan Smolinski,
who had two goals the second half of last season and has three this
season.</TE>
<TE>   "He's been much better this year," said Murray, who has played
Smolinski at center and on the wing. "He's got to be a contributor
for us to be successful."</TE>
<TE>   They also need better results from their power-play and
penalty-killing units.</TE>
<TE>   "We survived last year on being real good defensively, and special
teams," Murray said.</TE>
<TE>   Their power play led the NHL last season with a 20.7% success
rate, and their penalty killing ranked third, at 86.6%. This season,
they're at 14.5% on the power play, 21st, and 82.9% killing
penalties, 18th.</TE>
<TE>   Would those percentages be better with Guerin and/or Boucher in
the lineup?</TE>
<TE>   Taylor said the Kings' offer to Boucher was competitive but the
Stars gave the 29-year-old defenseman a fourth year on his contract.</TE>
<TE>   "He never came back to us to match it," Taylor said. "It was
disappointing. We would have liked to have kept Philippe."</TE>
<TE>   As for Guerin, he and the Kings weren't in the same financial
neighborhood.</TE>
<TE>   "We couldn't put a $9-million player in the budget," said Taylor,
whose payroll is $43.3 million, up from last season's $40.8 million.
However, it dropped from 10th-highest last season to 14th this
season, according to the Hockey News.</TE>
<TE>   "At the time, we were focused on getting younger. We have two
20-year-olds [Cammalleri and Alexander Frolov] who are doing fine....
We have to win some hockey games and keep an eye on the big picture.
We're in a difficult part of the schedule and we've been in some
tight games. We've got to find ways to win them."</TE>
<TE>   They'll have to win without Allison, whom Murray doesn't expect
back until February. They're 2-3-0-1 on this trip and 8-6-2-2 this
season.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought if we could be in .500 range after this trip and on the
season, we'd be in pretty solid position," Murray said. "The team
game we play gives us a chance in every game, and if we have a chance
every game, I think we'll win a good percentage of them and keep
ourselves in the hunt."</TE>
<TE>   Staying in the hunt is one thing. Bagging the Stanley Cup is
another, and the Kings haven't shown they have the depth and
dimensions to seriously contend. The Stars missed the playoffs last
spring, got better, and lead the West. The Kings lost ground by
standing relatively still, and it's hurting them now.</TE>
<TE>   Next spring will bring the 10th anniversary of their only trip to
the Cup finals. It's time they had something more to celebrate than
that.</TE>
<TE>   Sabre Dance</TE>
<TE>   Barely three years after their bitter loss to Dallas in the
Stanley Cup finals, the Buffalo Sabres are in disarray. They're
riding an 0-9-2 slide, and a loss or tie today at New Jersey would
match the club-record 12-game winless streak in the 1991-92 season.</TE>
<TE>   The NHL has been operating the Sabres since June, when owner John
Rigas became enmeshed in the collapse of Adelphia. Their
season-ticket base has shrunk to about 7,900 and their attendance
average of 12,938 is down 23% from a year ago.</TE>
<TE>   No wonder defenseman Jason Woolley, traded by the Sabres to the
Detroit Red Wings last week for a conditional draft pick, was
ecstatic, even though he took a $125,000 pay cut.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a new life," he said.</TE>
<TE>   So far, only one local buyer, Mark Hamister, who owns the Buffalo
Destroyers of the Arena Football League, has made an offer for the
club.</TE>
<TE>   Defeated New York gubernatorial candidate Thomas Golisano has said
he plans to make an offer but he hasn't made one yet.</TE>
<TE>   NHL Commissioner Gary Bettman wants to keep the franchise in
Buffalo for many reasons, among them belief that a move would create
an appearance of league instability.</TE>
<TE>   The Sabres -- and the economy -- haven't given fans compelling
reasons to be supportive. Their goaltending isn't bad, but they have
no scoring depth. Chris Gratton has played well and Miroslav Satan is
useful, but they haven't clicked on the power play and rank last in
the NHL. Maxim Afinogenov's slow recovery from a concussion hasn't
helped.</TE>
<TE>   It's sad to see the decline of a respected franchise that was the
model for small-market teams. A happy ending appears to be a long way
off, if it happens at all.</TE>
<TE>   End of an Era?</TE>
<TE>   The Blackhawks said tough guy Bob Probert "has decided to put his
hockey career on hold for the remainder of the season" to join their
radio broadcast crew, implying he might return. The truth is, he
probably won't play again. Probert, 37, has lots of hard mileage on
his odometer. In his prime, he was probably the game's most feared
enforcer, ranking alongside Dave Semenko and Dave Brown and a notch
above such sluggers as Tiger Williams, Dave Manson, Stu Grimson and
Marty McSorley.</TE>
<TE>   He could play, as evidenced by his 29- and 20-goal seasons with
Detroit, but fighting ruined his hands. With more emphasis these days
on skill and less on rough stuff, his time seems to have passed.
Today's enforcers must be able to play, especially with the
obstruction crackdown producing more power plays and leaving less
time for fourth liners.</TE>
<TE>   There will always be a place for guys who stand up for their
teammates, but there's less room for goonery. And that's as it should
be.</TE>
<TE>   Slap Shots</TE>
<TE>   The Flames held a 30-minute team meeting after their 1-0 loss to
the St. Louis Blues on Saturday, their third shutout in five games.
They have too much talent to be so feeble offensively, but last
season's scoring champion, Jarome Iginla, has four goals and 14
points. Chris Drury, a clutch scorer, needs some support.</TE>
<TE>   Good move by the Red Wings in acquiring Woolley to replace Jiri
Fischer, who tore a ligament in his knee and might be out six months.
Michigan State alum Woolley could be a decent power-play quarterback.</TE>
<TE>   And good for Detroit Coach Dave Lewis for ignoring suggestions he
should start former Maple Leaf Curtis Joseph last Saturday at
Toronto. One Toronto columnist insisted Lewis owed it to Maple Leaf
fans to play Joseph, a fan favorite in Toronto before he left as a
free agent last summer. Lewis' obligation was to play the goalie he
thought had the best chance to win, and he made the right choice:
Manny Legace, who has been playing better than Joseph, led the Red
Wings to a 2-1 victory.</TE>
<TE>   Canadien captain Saku Koivu, recovered from non-Hodgkin's lymphoma
but still going for periodic checkups, launched a foundation whose
goal is to raise $8 million and buy a high-tech scanner for Montreal
General Hospital. The lack of a PET/CAT scan machine in Montreal
meant Koivu had to travel nearly 100 miles for treatment in
Sherbrooke last winter. He pledged to donate $1,000 for every point
the Canadiens earn in the standings and $100,000 if they win the
Stanley Cup. Canadien President Pierre Boivin promised to match
Koivu's donations.</TE>
<TE>   Ranger goalie Mike Richter, kicked in the head Nov. 5, was told he
has a concussion. That's worrisome because he suffered a fractured
skull and concussion last March and needed several months to recover.
Dan Blackburn can handle the goaltending, but he needs more help from
the disorganized defense. The Rangers expect an offensive boost from
the return of Holik, hobbled by a sore hip.</TE>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>ST. LOUIS</DL>
<LD>Marc Bulger carried the St. Louis Rams another step in their
improbable run toward the playoffs although Kurt Warner made a cameo
appearance a week earlier than scheduled.</LD>
<LD>   Bulger threw for 347 yards and two touchdowns Monday night as the
Rams beat the Chicago Bears, 21-16, to win their fifth straight after
opening the season with five losses. That pulls them within two games
of San Francisco in the NFC West.</LD>
<LD>   "We just feel like we're finally out of a hole and we can make
progress to our goal of getting to the playoffs," Coach Mike Martz
said. "I'm proud of the way our team worked to get here. I'm not
happy yet with where we are."</LD>
<TE>   Isaac Bruce had six receptions for 141 yards and Adam Archuleta
led a Ram defense that sacked Chris Chandler seven times. Despite a
sore neck, Chandler was playing in place of Jim Miller, who had a

<TE>   The Bears (2-8) have lost eight in a row.</TE>
<TE>   Warner, who sat out five games because of a broken pinkie and is
scheduled to return next week in Washington, made his first
appearance since Sept. 29 in the second quarter, when Bulger was
taken to the locker room for X-rays on an injured index finger on his
throwing hand.</TE>
<TE>   Warner was sacked by Keith Traylor and completed one of two passes
for 13 yards. Bulger, 5-0 as a starter, returned after X-rays were
negative.</TE>
<TE>   "Kurt's our guy. I knew it going in, we talked all week about it,"
Bulger said. "I'm glad we're back to .500.</TE>
<TE>   "It won't be fun," he added about returning to the bench. "Kurt's
a great player. He's a two-time MVP. When he's back, it will be
another spark."</TE>
<TE>   With Marshall Faulk out with ankle and foot injuries, the Rams had
almost no running game. Lamar Gordon, Faulk's replacement, caught a
22-yard touchdown pass late in the first half, but St. Louis was
limited to 62 yards on the ground.</TE>
<TE>   The Rams scored on the first and last drives of the first half to
take a 14-6 halftime lead.</TE>

<HD>Ronaldo's in Running for FIFA World Player</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>Grahame L. Jones</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Ronaldo's on-field performances have left much to be desired since he
led Brazil to its fifth World Cup title in June, but Monday the
26-year-old Real Madrid striker was one of three players named as
finalists for the 2002 FIFA world player of the year award.</LD>
<LD>   German goalkeeper Oliver Kahn of Bayern Munich and French
playmaker Zinedine Zidane, also of Real Madrid, are Ronaldo's two
rivals for the honor.</LD>
<LD>   The Brazilian won the award, which is voted on by national team
coaches, in 1996 and 1997, while Zidane was the winner in 1998 and
2000. No goalkeeper has won since the honor's inception in 1991.</LD>
<TE>   The three finalists for the 2002 FIFA women's world player of the
year award all play in the Women's United Soccer Assn. They are
forward Mia Hamm of the United States, last year's winner, forward
Birgit Prinz of Germany and playmaker Sun Wen of China, last year's
runner-up.</TE>
<TE>   FIFA will announce the winners in Madrid on Dec. 17.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Ronaldo already has been selected as player of the year
by the influential French magazine Onze Mondial and is in line to be
named European player of the year.</TE>
<TE>   Along with Real Madrid teammates Roberto Carlos and Flavio
Conceicao, he left Spain on Monday to fly to Seoul, where Brazil
plays South Korea in one of 23 international matches scheduled
Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Scolari Weighs Offer</TE>
<TE>   Luiz Felipe Scolari, who coached Brazil to its 2002 World Cup
triumph, said he will wait until the end of the month to decide which
of several coaching offers to accept, including one to become
Portugal's national team coach.</TE>
<TE>   "I will have to weigh up if they are only important financially,
or [fulfill] a dream that I have had for some years," Scolari told
the Portuguese daily A Bola.</TE>
<TE>   Scolari has long sought to coach in Europe, and accepting the
Portugal position, while potentially less lucrative, would
immediately put him back on a major stage because Portugal is host of
the 2004 European Championship.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Relegation Woes</TE>
<TE>   Two of Brazil's most illustrious clubs, Palmeiras and Botafogo,
have suffered the ignominy of being relegated to the second division
after both teams endured woeful seasons in the Brazilian league.</TE>
<TE>   For Palmeiras, the demotion is especially difficult to digest
because the club was South American champion as recently as 1999 and
Brazilian champion in 1993 and 1994.</TE>
<TE>   "The team had several opportunities to avoid relegation, but
proved unable to keep us up," Coach Levir Culpi said. "Now we are
going to have to pay the price for our own incompetence."</TE>
<TE>   Botafogo Coach Carlos Alberto Torres was dismayed but
philosophical.</TE>
<TE>   "This humiliation is much worse than losing a final, because you
get over that the next day," he said. "It's sad, but Botafogo will
bounce back."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Russian Roulette</TE>
<TE>   Lokomotiv Moscow and CSKA finished the Russian season tied atop
the standings, each with 66 points from 30 matches.</TE>
<TE>   The Russian Premier League decided Monday that a one-game playoff
Thursday at a neutral venue, Moscow's Dynamo Stadium, will decide the
title winner.</TE>
<TE>   That decision angered CSKA and Russia national team Coach Valery
Gazzayev, and with some reason.</TE>
<TE>   "Why play another match?" he asked. "We have a better won-lost
record than Lokomotiv and we also have a better goal difference, so
it's clear to me which is the better team."</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Mike Seidman was crushed when USC failed to recruit him hard out of
Westlake High. His father had been a Trojan baseball player and the
family wanted Mike to continue the legacy.</LD>
<LD>   But the Trojans didn't pursue him, even though he was rated as the
No. 1 tight end in the nation.</LD>
<LD>   "That was a thorn in my foot," he said.</LD>
<TE>   Seidman signed with UCLA and is enjoying a prolific senior year
with 34 catches for 535 yards and four touchdowns. But like all the
Bruin seniors, he hasn't defeated the Trojans.</TE>
<TE>   "The main difference this year is that we've won [three] in a row,
we are ranked and have confidence," he said. "We know we can win."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Drew Olson will start at quarterback and Coach Bob Toledo is
making no promises regarding the playing time of his backup, Matt
Moore.</TE>
<TE>   "Drew will start and I'll probably give Matt Moore a chance, then
go from there," Toledo said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Freshman defensive tackle C.J. Niusulu, a frequently used reserve,
underwent an emergency appendectomy Monday and will not play the rest
of the season. Saia Makakaufaki will move from tight end to defensive
tackle to add depth.</TE>
<TE>   Toledo said the absence of Niusulu will not tempt coaches to play
Rodney Leisle before he is fully recovered from foot surgery. "I
won't play him unless he is ready," Toledo said. "Niusulu's situation
will have no bearing on Rodney."</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Freshman receiver Mike Williams said his injured left ankle felt fine
Monday after USC's first practice in preparation for rival UCLA.</LD>
<LD>   But Williams laid blame squarely on himself for a nagging left
quadriceps injury that limited his effectiveness against Arizona
State and could affect his performance against UCLA.</LD>
<LD>   "I'm still hurt because I neglected to go to treatment all last
week," Williams said. "I'm paying for it now. I have to make sure I
get treatment every day, twice a day, this week so I can get healthy.
Because right now, I'm really not any good."</LD>
<TE>   Williams, who was averaging 6.4 receptions and 101.4 yards a game,
caught only one pass in the Trojans' 34-13 victory over Arizona State
last Saturday, an 18-yard touchdown pass from Carson Palmer.</TE>
<TE>   Williams appeared a step slow on several other routes.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't want to accept the fact that I'm actually hurt or
actually injured," Williams said of his failure to get treatment.
"That's not me to be hurt. I can't stand it.</TE>
<TE>   "I felt like going to treatment only made it more of a reality
that I was hurt. But that's pretty childish, so I have to get over
that and get treatment so I can actually be able to play and make a
difference in the game."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Daryl Gross and Steve Lopes, senior associate athletic directors
at USC, will meet with Sugar Bowl officials today in New Orleans and
with Orange Bowl officials Wednesday in Miami to make a case for the
Trojans' inclusion in one of the bowl championship series games if
they defeat UCLA and Notre Dame. USC moved up to No. 8 in the BCS
standings Monday.... Senior running back Sultan McCullough wore a
padded bandage on his right index finger after getting it caught on a
helmet against Arizona State.</TE>

<LD>USC vs. UCLA, Saturday, 12:30 p.m.</LD>
<LD>   at Rose Bowl, Channel 7</LD>
<LD>   *</LD>
<TE>   As USC's offensive coordinator, Norm Chow is searching for
weakness and devising ways to attack UCLA's defense.</TE>
<TE>   Phil Snow, UCLA's defensive coordinator, is meticulously studying
the Trojans and installing a plan to stop them.</TE>
<TE>   In the end, both coaches' pregame maneuvering might not matter
when the seventh-ranked Trojans play the No. 25 Bruins on Saturday at
the Rose Bowl.</TE>
<TE>   "You can talk schemes all you want," Snow said. "It comes down to
players making plays."</TE>
<TE>   That won't stop Chow and Snow from working nonstop until gametime
to put their charges in the most opportune positions to make those
plays.</TE>
<TE>   Both units are ranked in near-identical positions on opposite
sides in Pacific 10 Conference statistics. Consider:</TE>
<TE>   * USC ranks third in total offense at 421.2 yards a game. UCLA
ranks third in total defense at 336.</TE>
<TE>   * USC ranks second in rushing offense at 122.3 yards a game. UCLA
ranks second in rushing defense at 122.2</TE>
<TE>   * USC ranks fourth in passing offense at 298.9. UCLA is third in
passing defense at 213.8.</TE>
<TE>   "They are really sound, so we are going to have to work very hard
to get some stuff going and move the chains," Chow said. "I don't
think anything big is going to happen because [Snow's] not going to
let it. He's too good at what he does."</TE>
<TE>   Snow must find a way neutralize USC's multi-formation offense,
which has produced more than 400 yards in each of the last six games.</TE>
<TE>   Quarterback Carson Palmer, who needs 76 yards to surpass
Stanford's Steve Stenstrom as the Pac-10's all-time passing yardage
leader, has thrown 15 touchdown passes in the last four games. But
Palmer is only one weapon in an offense that has evolved into one of
the most balanced in the Pac-10.</TE>
<TE>   Flanker Keary Colbert established himself as the Trojans' most
sure-handed receiver with an 11-reception performance against Kansas
State. Mike Williams had a breakout game against Oregon State that
put him on track to become the most prolific freshman receiver in
Pac-10 history.</TE>
<TE>   The Trojan rushing game emerged in earnest against California when
senior Sultan McCullough tied a career best by rushing for 176 yards
in 39 carries. After a victory over Washington, USC Coach Pete
Carroll gave Justin Fargas his first start at tailback and the
fifth-year senior responded by rushing for 139 yards in 27 carries
against Oregon.</TE>
<TE>   "The key is to get them out of the rhythm of their offense," Snow
said. "They throw a lot of four-yard passes that turn into 30-yard
gains. A key will be yards after the catch. If we tackle, we'll be
all right."</TE>
<TE>   UCLA plays a 4-3 defense and blitzes often. The Bruin pass rush is
led by defensive end Dave Ball, who has a sack in eight consecutive
games and is third in the Pac-10 with 10.5 sacks. Weak-side
linebacker Spencer Havner has a team-best 78 tackles, including nine
for losses. Middle linebacker Marcus Reese has 77 tackles.</TE>
<TE>   "You try to figure out what the other guy is going to do ... but
you never really know until the game starts," Chow said. "That's when
it gets interesting."</TE>
<TE>   Times staff writer Steve Henson contributed to this report.</TE>

<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Before the month is over, a federal mediator is expected to issue
guidelines intended to break an impasse between the Metropolitan
Transportation Authority and a bus riders group seeking to reduce bus
overcrowding.</LD>
<LD>   Washington, D.C., attorney Donald Bliss wants the MTA and the Bus
Riders Union to use his guidelines as a roadmap to find a solution to
the overcrowding. Among their options: buy more buses or manage bus
lines in innovative ways to reduce the number of riders forced to
stand.</LD>
<LD>   If the groups can't find common ground, Bliss will step in once
more, deciding on his own what to do.</LD>
<TE>   A gulf separates the two sides. The riders union has long
contended that the MTA must put hundreds of new buses on Los Angeles
County streets, while the transit authority maintains that its fleet
of about 2,300 buses is sufficient.</TE>
<TE>   The dispute started in 1994 when the Bus Riders Union sued the
MTA, alleging poor service in minority areas. To avoid a trial, the
MTA in 1996 entered into a federal agreement promising to provide
better bus service over a 10-year period. While the agency has done
much to boost bus service -- it has replaced most of its buses with
new vehicles -- it has continually appealed the decree in court and
has dragged its feet on following court orders.</TE>
<TE>   After repeatedly being turned away and sternly rebuked by federal
appeals court judges, the agency's last-ditch effort to be heard by
the U.S. Supreme Court was turned down in March.</TE>
<TE>   Since the Supreme Court decision, the MTA and Bus Riders Union
representatives, who are supposed to monitor the transit agency's
efforts to alleviate overcrowding, have held scores of meetings. Both
sides acknowledge they have gotten nowhere.</TE>
<TE>   To help remedy the situation, Bliss has twice come to Los Angeles,
meeting with both sides, reviewing finances, taking testimony in
court and touring the bus system. On a visit last month, Bliss said
he was impressed with the progress the MTA has made in upgrading its
fleet, noting that the agency's new clean-fuel bus fleet is by far
the largest in the United States.</TE>
<TE>   But Bliss also said more must be done to eliminate overcrowding.</TE>
<TE>   In recent discussions, the MTA has asked Bliss to recognize that
many factors contribute to overcrowding: traffic accidents, rainy
streets and special events such as concerts or basketball games. The
transit agency says ordering more buses may be a misguided and costly
solution.</TE>
<TE>   In an interview last week, MTA Chief Executive Roger Snoble
speculated that the final outcome would be a directive for his agency
to order "a couple hundred" new buses -- in addition to about 200
buses it already plans to buy.</TE>
<TE>   The riders union, which last week held a small rally at City Hall
to begin pressing MTA board member Mayor James K. Hahn to more
forcefully back their effort, is calling for 850 buses to be put on
the road as soon as possible.</TE>
<TE>   "It's been five years since we signed an agreement with the MTA,
and they are still dragging their feet," said union co-chair Barbara
Lott-Holland. "It's time they start living up to their promises. If
Bliss isn't going to help, we want Hahn to just step right in and
demand the MTA order the buses we so desperately need."</TE>

<HD>Taking Chinese in High School Means Great Wall to Conquer</HD>
<DH>Challenges are many for Orange County teacher and students.
Language is complex, and he gets creative to keep them interested.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Claire Luna</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The students' surf shorts and freckled faces, a Mexican flag draped
on one wall and Spanish-language workbooks spilling off the shelves
-- to all appearances, it's a typical high school foreign-language
classroom in suburban south Orange County.</LD>
<LD>   Their conversation, however, is anything but predictable: Ni hao?
Ni, chi fan le, mei yu? Wo bu dong.</LD>
<LD>   These sophomores at Rancho Santa Margarita's Tesoro High --
roughly 20 boys and a couple of testosterone-tolerant girls -- in
advanced Chinese III actually began studying the language five years
ago, in fifth grade, with the same teacher, Steve Cook.</LD>
<TE>   Chinese is more often taught in areas with large Asian
populations, such as San Francisco and the San Gabriel Valley, and
often by native speakers to children who have at least some
familiarity with the language.</TE>
<TE>   Cook, by contrast, learned Chinese as a Mormon missionary when he
was in his 20s. His challenge is to teach a language that neither he
nor his students grew up speaking, and one they cannot yet use much
outside class.</TE>
<TE>   To that end, Cook has engaged his students over the years with
activities that emphasize culture over rote memorization -- Chinese
chess tournaments in the classroom, scavenger hunts in Chinatown, a
monthlong field trip to China.</TE>
<TE>   With college not far off for his oldest students, Cook knows time
is running out to ensure that Chinese captivates them to the point
they won't abandon it.</TE>
<TE>   "High school is not enough time to become fluent in any language,
much less one they can't practice outside class," Cook said. "My job
is to get them fascinated enough so they pursue it in college and
afterward on their own."</TE>
<TE>   Brian Clyne agreed with most of his classmates that no matter how
great his aspiration to learn an unusual foreign language, if it
weren't for Cook's creativity he would have dropped it years ago.</TE>
<TE>   "We see this as really fun, but definitely a lifetime commitment,"
said Brian, toting an oversized costume head of a laughing monk to
the teacher's minivan.</TE>
<TE>   "Even if we wanted to now, I don't think any of us can imagine
abandoning Chinese after we've already invested all this time."</TE>
<TE>   Brian and others in the class have continued taking Chinese even
after exhausting the district's language requirement and despite
having to pass up surfing class, which meets at the same time.</TE>
<TE>   Why? To give themselves a leg up in college admissions and the job
market, they said.</TE>
<TE>   "My parents were really surprised when I was the one to push
staying with Chinese, rather than the other way around," Brian said.
"But you need something to set you apart from your peers in this
world."</TE>
<TE>   Cook's students are among some 1,900 in 35 California high schools
enrolled in advanced Chinese-language classes, according to the state
Department of Education. In contrast, there are about 93,000 students
at 850 high schools taking the same level of Spanish instruction.</TE>
<TE>   Instructors throughout the U.S. education system are hard-pressed
to produce students who can function in multiple languages of even
the traditional types. In a nation where foreign-language classes are
viewed in the same light as band or auto shop -- options rather than
necessities -- experts in the field say an overhaul in the way they
are taught is needed.</TE>
<TE>   Language classes should begin earlier and be cast as teaching
lifelong skills rather than academic subjects, said J. David Edwards,
director of the Joint National Committee on Languages, a coalition of
60 language teaching groups.</TE>
<TE>   "We'll be seeing this deficiency in our students as long as we
treat foreign languages as an elective instead of a required course
started in elementary school," he said.</TE>
<TE>   In Capistrano Unified, which oversees Tesoro High, a federal grant
that had subsidized the district's Chinese-language program will end
after this year. District officials said they are committed to
continuing the program, which in the last five years has expanded to
include kindergarten through fourth grade.</TE>
<TE>   Often, school districts don't have the resources to independently
maintain language programs launched with external seed funding, so
the programs must end when the money dries up.</TE>
<TE>   "We have a lot of board members that feel strongly that in order
to be citizens in a global society we really need to be bilingual,"
said Susan McGill, Capistrano's executive director of elementary
operation services. "Although we would love to be able to expand
language programs to all of the elementary schools, we know that
we're lucky just to be able to continue what we have."</TE>
<TE>   For a program whose earliest students are now sophomores, the
challenges are still numerous for Cook.</TE>
<TE>   He is limited by circumstance: Because he also teaches
middle-school students and Tesoro's freshmen, he has to shuttle
around South County with whatever classroom materials he can fit in
two canvas bags.</TE>
<TE>   Also straining Cook is the challenge for a nonnative speaker to
teach a language with complex grammar and pronunciation rules he
doesn't fully understand.</TE>
<TE>   The issue came up recently when Jammie Peng, one of two students
with enough Chinese-language background to transfer to the advanced
class, was frustrated when he couldn't tell her the meaning of a
character on a bag of Chinese candy.</TE>
<TE>   "You're Chinese; if you don't know, how should I?" Cook asked,
laughing.</TE>
<TE>   His Chinese III students can recognize about 100 characters and
write about three dozen, a showing that Cook acknowledges is "dismal"
compared with the few hundred that most students in other schools'
same-level classes can write.</TE>
<TE>   As in the lower-level classes, Cook concentrates heavily in
Chinese III on culture, history and lifestyle through videos along
with the games and field trips.</TE>
<TE>   Although Cook acknowledges that those lessons consume time that
could be devoted to more concrete language instruction, he says
learning about lifestyle in conjunction with grammar and vocabulary
is needed to maintain the students' interest through high school and
beyond.</TE>
<TE>   Those less academic activities are integral to learning Chinese in
a way that actually proves helpful when talking with others in the
language, Tesoro sophomore Chris Finical said.</TE>
<TE>   While in China last summer, the students simultaneously practiced
their Chinese and participated in park tournaments. They could
communicate with people on a personal level since their classes
covered current events, Chris said.</TE>

<HD>McClintock Bows to Westly as Contest for Controller Ends</HD>
<DH>Counting of remaining ballots is expected to confirm
Democrats' historic sweep of California's constitutional offices.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Carl Ingram</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>Republican Tom McClintock conceded defeat Monday in his Nov. 5
contest for state controller against millionaire Democrat Steve
Westly, as a relative handful of votes gave Democrats a sweep of
every statewide office.</LD>
<LD>   Capping one of the closest races for a constitutional office in
California history, McClintock made the announcement as Westly clung
to a lead of only 21,027 votes (or 0.3%) in their seesaw contest to
become the state's chief financial officer.</LD>
<LD>   After 13 days of tallying ballots, McClintock said it was clear
that Westly would win. Unofficial results tallied by Secretary of
State Bill Jones gave Westly 3,219,082 votes to McClintock's
3,198,055. About 167,000 returns were yet to be counted. A few close
legislative races also remained undecided.</LD>
<TE>   "With a full heart, I wish our new controller Godspeed as he
assumes the chief fiscal office of California at a time of great
fiscal distress for our state and its people," McClintock said. The
two men spoke by telephone at midafternoon.</TE>
<TE>   Westly said he had thanked McClintock for a "very gracious"
concession call. "He ran a very strong campaign," said Westly, a
former senior vice president of the online auction company EBay.</TE>
<TE>   As controller, Westly said, he will be a powerful voice for
"putting our fiscal house in order." He said Gov. Gray Davis and
lawmakers will listen to him because he will "know where the money is
coming from and how much" there will be.</TE>
<TE>   "People are looking for someone to immediately tackle the budget
crisis," Westly said of the mammoth $21.1-billion deficit facing
Davis and legislators in the next state budget.</TE>
<TE>   By selecting Democrats to hold every statewide office, from
governor to insurance commissioner, Californians went against the
national tide in which Republicans recaptured the U.S. Senate and
strengthened their majority in the House.</TE>
<TE>   If Westly's win is confirmed when all the votes have been counted,
it will be the first time in more than half a century that one party
occupied every constitutional office in California. That last
occurred in 1946, when Gov. Earl Warren won his second term and led a
Republican sweep. At the time, he and others appeared on the ballot
as nominees backed by both parties in a voting system known as cross
filing.</TE>
<TE>   The last time Democrats swept all statewide offices was in 1882.</TE>
<TE>   Westly, who billed himself as conservative on fiscal issues and
moderate on social issues, was making his first run for office in the
race against McClintock, a Capitol veteran and a conservative on
budget, tax and social issues.</TE>
<TE>   For years, Westly had worked as an energetic operative in the
Democratic Party, performing important but thankless bureaucratic
tasks. At one point, he challenged former Gov. Jerry Brown for
chairmanship of the state party, and lost.</TE>
<TE>   Westly contributed about $5 million of his own money to match a
like amount from donors.</TE>
<TE>   The concession marked McClintock's second defeat for controller.
In a statement, he said that, when he returns to the state Senate
next month -- with two years to serve before he can seek reelection
-- he intends to be active in fighting new taxes and high spending.</TE>

<HD>Man Accused of Shooting Alleged Rapist Is Charged</HD>
<DH>A Pacoima father pleads not guilty to one count of assault
in the attack on a family friend he thought had raped his daughter.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jean Guccione</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Los Angeles County prosecutors charged a Pacoima father with assault
Monday for allegedly shooting a man he believed had raped his
17-year-old daughter.</LD>
<LD>   Prosecutors declined to file criminal charges against the shooting
victim on Monday, saying they lacked sufficient evidence to bring a
rape case to trial.</LD>
<LD>   Martin Bravo Hernandez, 39, is accused of shooting a family
friend, Jose Salvador Argueta, 25, three times with a .25-caliber
handgun Thursday night as Argueta sat in his car in the parking lot
of Pacifica Hospital of the Valley in Sun Valley.</LD>
<TE>   Hernandez pleaded not guilty Monday to one felony count of assault
with a firearm and denied the special allegations of using a firearm
and causing great bodily injury, Deputy Dist. Atty. Daniel Damon
said.</TE>
<TE>   Hernandez, who has no known criminal history, faces as much as 17
years in prison, Damon said. Police said Hernandez had overheard his
daughter tell her brother and her boyfriend that Argueta sexually
assaulted her earlier that day at Sepulveda Recreation Park.</TE>
<TE>   Argueta was alleged to have offered the teenager a ride, then
driven her to the park, where he assaulted her, police said.
Afterward, Argueta allegedly drove the girl home.</TE>
<TE>   Deputy Dist. Atty. Carolyn McMary said she had declined to file a
rape charge against Argueta because the evidence was insufficient.
She declined to elaborate.</TE>
<TE>   Argueta, who suffered wounds to his torso, a leg and both hands,
was treated at County-USC Medical Center and released, Damon said. He
was still in custody at Men's Central Jail in downtown Los Angeles
late Monday, authorities said.</TE>
<TE>   Hernandez, who was arrested late Thursday, was being held at the
Inmate Reception Center in lieu of $85,000 bail.</TE>
<TE>   He is scheduled to return to court Dec. 9 in San Fernando.</TE>

<HD>'Cancer in Energy Industry' Described</HD>
<DH>State legislators hear allegations of price manipulation by
natural gas traders.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Nancy Vogel</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>An energy industry whistle-blower told state senators Monday that
natural gas traders across the nation commonly lied about their
transactions to drive market prices and boost profits.</LD>
<LD>   The testimony portrayed a rotten underpinning to the energy
industry, with widespread manipulation of even the prices published
in newsletters that traders and regulators use to determine long-term
contract prices and the rates charged to consumers.</LD>
<LD>   "The cancer in the energy industry is very deep and perhaps
inoperable," Sen. Joe Dunn (D-Santa Ana), head of the select
committee to investigate price manipulation of California's wholesale
energy market, said after a daylong hearing.</LD>
<TE>   "If we accept the testimony today at face value," he said, "I can
say without reservation there was criminal conduct in the pricing of
natural gas."</TE>
<TE>   Dunn said he would turn over to the attorney general evidence of
violations of a state law that makes it a misdemeanor to release
false information to affect market prices.</TE>
<TE>   There's proof of wrongdoing, he said, in the 3-inch stack of
e-mails and documents given to the Senate committee by Michele
Markey, the former chief of electricity and natural gas prices for
Gas Daily.</TE>
<TE>   Markey, now director of natural gas for Apache Corp. in Houston,
testified after Dunn's committee granted her immunity from state
criminal prosecution.</TE>
<TE>   At Gas Daily, Markey said, she supervised a team of reporters who
gathered information volunteered by energy companies about the volume
and price of natural gas trades. Gas Daily is one of a handful of
private newsletters that compile and report natural gas market prices
at key pipeline delivery points around the country.</TE>
<TE>   In California, regulators rely heavily on these newsletters to set
prices at two key spots on the Oregon and Nevada borders. The Public
Utilities Commission has long used these price indices to judge
whether utilities are paying reasonable prices when they buy natural
gas and to set the price the utilities must pay to buy electricity
from small generators.</TE>
<TE>   PUC staff members say the prices tracked by Gas Daily and other
publications strongly influence how much millions of Californians pay
for natural gas and, ultimately, electricity, because most of the
state's power plants are fueled by natural gas.</TE>
<TE>   Markey described nearly a dozen cases in which unidentified
companies reported unusually high volumes of natural gas at prices
slightly higher or lower than the market average. Those trades, she
said, had the effect of pushing the index price up or down by a few
cents, which could lead to millions of additional profit for some
companies.</TE>
<TE>   Though Markey has been subpoenaed by the Federal Energy Regulatory
Commission and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, she told her
story of fraudulent trade reporting for the first time in Sacramento
in response to a subpoena by Dunn's committee.</TE>
<TE>   Markey said she left Gas Daily in March 2002, after it was
purchased by Platts, the energy market information division of the
McGraw-Hill Cos. She said she strongly suspected Enron Corp. of
regularly reporting false information and was hiring a firm to audit
Enron's information when Gas Daily was sold to Platts. The audit
never took place, she said.</TE>
<TE>   Platts officials could not be reached for comment, but Senate
investigators offered their own explanation for the aborted audit.
Investigator Christian Schreiber said Enron was Platts' biggest
customer. It bought 700 subscriptions (each costing about $1,600 a
year) to Platts publications.</TE>

<HD>New Program Aids in Seizure of Illegal Guns</HD>
<DH>Two dozen owners have been arrested and the rate is
expected to grow as database is expanded to target 'the worst of the
worst.'</DH>

<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>In a drive to take guns away from convicted felons, spouse abusers
and others banned from possessing them, state law enforcement agents
have seized about 200 weapons and arrested two dozen gun violators in
recent months.</LD>
<LD>   They predict that the arrest and seizure statistics will increase
dramatically in coming years as technology is improved and
information is instantly fed to police agencies statewide.</LD>
<LD>   The new program, which has been in effect since July, was created
by a state law that authorized construction of a database that will
cross-reference the names of gun owners against records tracking
court convictions, restraining orders and individuals ruled to be
dangerous to themselves or others.</LD>
<TE>   The information will allow investigators to zero in on about
170,000 Californians who illegally possess guns. Officials estimate
that the database will cost at least $4 million to establish.</TE>
<TE>   A key element is checking gun purchase applications that have been
rejected by the state because the applicants are banned by law from
possessing guns.</TE>
<TE>   Previous legal gun purchases by the rejected applicants are also
cross-checked. In about 1% of the checks, investigators discover that
the applicants had purchased guns legally prior to their convictions.
On that basis, warrants to seize the weapons can be obtained when
necessary.</TE>
<TE>   The program differs dramatically from previous practices in which
there were no checks or follow-up action on rejected gun applicants.</TE>
<TE>   "About 1,000 guns are purchased every day in California, and about
10 people are rejected after record checks," said Hallye Jordan,
spokeswoman for the state attorney general's office.</TE>
<TE>   Other groups also are under scrutiny, she said. Those include
Californians with permits to carry concealed weapons, security
guards, law enforcement officials, gun dealers and registered owners
of assault rifles.</TE>
<TE>   The program, Jordan said, ultimately will target "the worst of the
worst" of those who illegally possess weapons. She estimated that
17,000 violators will be added to the database each year.</TE>
<TE>   "At some point, a database will marry all gun records with
offenders and that will be available at the push of a button to
patrol officers," Jordan said. "But that will take some time."</TE>
<TE>   Randy Rossi, director of the firearms division of the state
Department of Justice, said much of the information about prohibited
gun ownership comes from the 2,000 gun dealers in the state and
records regulating assault weapons.</TE>
<TE>   "More than 40% of the people we have gone after so far have
domestic violence backgrounds," Rossi said. "We have been averaging
about 10 firearms per case. Also seizing hundreds of rounds of
ammunition."</TE>
<TE>   When declaring October as Domestic Violence Awareness Month in
California, Atty. Gen. Bill Lockyer also emphasized the importance of
getting guns away from those with a history of violence toward family
members.</TE>
<TE>   "This first-in-the-nation program targets lawbreakers who pose an
immediate threat ... because they are armed and dangerous," Lockyer
said.</TE>
<TE>   The Department of Justice has two five-agent teams assigned to the
program and expects to have a third by the end of the year. When
going after suspects, they work closely with local police agencies,
who make the actual arrests.</TE>
<TE>   Officials track rejections of handgun applications at gun shows as
well as stores. But they must usually wait for a tip from a concerned
spouse or relative.</TE>
<TE>   "One immediate goal for us is to increase the awareness of local
law enforcement agencies about this, and we have done some outreach
to accomplish that," Jordan said.</TE>
<TE>   Rossi added that a crucial concern is officer safety. "This can be
lifesaving information," he said.</TE>

<HD>3 Leaders of Aryan Hate Groups Held</HD>
<DH>Orange County authorities charge two with having materials
to make bombs. A third faces perjury and weapons counts.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jeff Gottlieb</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Orange County authorities arrested two white supremacist leaders
Monday, charging them with having had materials to make a bomb in
1999, including 50 gallons of gasoline they kept in their Anaheim
apartment, enough to blow up the building.</LD>
<LD>   A third white supremacist leader was arrested on perjury and
weapons charges.</LD>
<LD>   The bomb complaint against Christine Greenwood and her boyfriend,
John Patrick McCabe, said authorities also found BBs, razor blades
and 16 nails that could be used as shrapnel, several battery-operated
clocks that could operate as timers, and a shopping list of
bomb-making materials.</LD>
<TE>   Deputy Dist. Atty. Nicholas S. Thompson said Greenwood and McCabe
did not appear to have a target. He said authorities did not move
against them two years ago because fears of terrorism weren't as high
a priority as now.</TE>
<TE>   The third suspect, John Frederick Steele II, was charged with
perjury and falsifying documents relating to financial statements he
was required to give his probation officer. Thompson said that during
a search of Steele's home Monday, authorities found a letter
addressed to the white supremacist Christian Defense League
advocating that members align themselves with Palestinian extremists
to target Jews.</TE>
<TE>   Steele is the California leader of Aryan Nations, known as the
Brandenburg Division. Aryan Nations is one of the country's most
influential racist groups.</TE>
<TE>   Greenwood is active in Women for Aryan Unity and was organizer of
the Aryan Baby Drive, which collects donated clothing for poor white
families. She also is active with the group Blood and Honour, as was
McCabe, her live-in boyfriend. The group promotes rock music with
racist themes.</TE>
<TE>   Greenwood, 28, and Steele, 29, were being held in the Orange
County Jail in lieu of $100,000 bail. McCabe, 23, already was in
prison for a probation violation. None of the three were represented
by attorneys as of late Monday.</TE>
<TE>   "This is the continuing effort by law enforcement to suck the
oxygen from these groups by going after their leaders and using every
legal remedy to raise the price of doing their business in our
community," Dist. Atty. Tony Rackauckas said at a news conference
announcing the arrests.</TE>
<TE>   The bomb materials were discovered in April 1999 when probation
officials searched the apartment McCabe and Greenwood shared. At the
time, McCabe was on probation for a hate crime, Thompson said. He had
served six months in the Orange County Jail.</TE>
<TE>   A search of McCabe's apartment turned up child pornography on a
computer, which is what sent McCabe back to prison to serve 16 months
for violating probation, Thompson said.</TE>
<TE>   Thompson acknowledged that authorities could come in for criticism
and "potential embarrassment" for not acting earlier. "There's a
clear crime here that was frankly missed," he said.</TE>
<TE>   He said that before the Sept. 11 attacks, the emphasis was not on
terrorism. Thompson said that after the attacks, he became the
district attorney's representative to local terrorist task forces.
The Orange County Probation Department later brought him the
information about the bomb-making materials found in April 1999.</TE>
<TE>   McCabe's arrest two years earlier seemed to have broken the
momentum of the bomb plans, Thompson said. Until the new charges were
filed, McCabe had been scheduled for release from prison in three
months.</TE>
<TE>   Steele, a security guard at the Port of Los Angeles, was on
probation for assault with a deadly weapon for stabbing a Latino man,
Thompson said.</TE>

<HD>Pasadena Center Puts Focus on Youth Development</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>Cara Mia DiMassa</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The exterior calm of the tiny Pasadena building, nestled between
boarded-up storefronts and one-story homes, belies the bustle within.</LD>
<LD>   In one room, teenagers play on computers, surfing the Internet and
doing homework. In another, teachers prepare snacks. And in a third,
60 schoolchildren talk -- all at once.</LD>
<LD>   The building, and the after-school program it shelters, is a
project of NATHA, a community group with two explanations for its
acronym.</LD>
<TE>   One, Navarro Avenue Tremont Howard Assn., makes it sound like a
staid neighborhood watch group, which, in part, it is. The other,
Neighbors Acting Together Helping All, demonstrates the
organization's other purpose: to be a model for what can happen when
people come together to serve their community.</TE>
<TE>   NATHA was founded 11 years ago when residents of the area in
northwest Pasadena banded together to fight an onslaught of drugs and
gangs.</TE>
<TE>   "We couldn't understand why that element was able to thrive," said
Celestine McFearn Walker, a resident of the area and now director of
NATHA. "So we decided to do something about it."</TE>
<TE>   Their first priority was helping children. "We noticed that a lot
of young people had no specific thing to do after school," Walker
said. There was "no one to embrace or support them."</TE>
<TE>   So residents began organizing: first one street, then another.
Today, their 4,000-square-foot recreation center serves as many as
100 children a day from three elementary schools. High school and
college-age students help with homework -- from algebra to simple
paper cutouts for holiday decorations.</TE>
<TE>   They are also there to be role models, to teach lessons learned
outside the classroom.</TE>
<TE>   "Our center is centered around youth development," Walker said.
"We want to make them strong members of the society, so that they
have specific skills to make the transition from adolescence to
adulthood."</TE>
<TE>   Walker likes to refer to a child's circle of influence, the many
factors that determine who and what a child will become. At NATHA,
she said, children are offered a refuge, a place that can serve as a
constant in their lives.</TE>
<TE>   "We are trying to make sure we keep that circle consistent," she
said. "We are structured so that they can rely on us for whatever
support they need."</TE>
<TE>   NATHA is one of several dozen Southern California organizations
that received donations from last year's Los Angeles Times Holiday
Campaign.</TE>
<TE>   The annual campaign, established in 2000, is a part of the Los
Angeles Times Family Fund, a fund of the McCormick Tribune
Foundation. The McCormick Tribune Foundation matches the first
$700,000 raised at 50 cents on the dollar.</TE>

<HD>Plan for Parking Lot Angers San Marino Enclave</HD>
<DH>The Mission Street area needs space for cars. But an effort
to seize a site for the purpose has upset a tightly knit group of
local people.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Cara Mia DiMassa</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>San Marino's Mission district is perhaps the city's best kept secret:
an upscale enclave, catering almost exclusively to the locals, where
you can have your hair tinted, buy a three-carat diamond and snack on
lemon creme brulee scones.</LD>
<LD>   But now, to hear some locals tell it, a city plan to build a
40-space parking lot along Mission Street has threatened the very
nature of the district -- and brought out some very un-San Marino
behavior in the process.</LD>
<LD>   "We don't want any antagonism," Vice Mayor Betty Brown said last
week to residents who packed the City Council chambers, spilling into
the hall. "If everyone could remain civil, it would help."</LD>
<TE>   For this cozy city of 13,000, where council members greet those
who speak before them by first name, the admonition seemed, at best,
out of character. But so did the boos hurled at one speaker.</TE>
<TE>   "Quiet out there, you rabble rousers," Brown admonished the crowd.</TE>
<TE>   Rabble rousers? In San Marino, where the average house sells for
almost $800,000?</TE>
<TE>   Well, yes. This is Southern California, and the issue is parking.</TE>
<TE>   Residents and business owners along Mission say a lack of parking
has been a problem since at least 1990. Nearby homeowners complain
that shoppers crowd their streets and block their driveways,
especially on weekends.</TE>
<TE>   Owners of two of the boulevard's big-draw businesses said they
have tried to find solutions. William Bell, owner of the Gates of
Spain hair salon, estimated that he has paid $10,000 this year to the
owner of a local gas station for extra spaces for his patrons and
employees.</TE>
<TE>   Sue Campoy, owner of Julienne restaurant, estimated that she had
spent $8,000. "That's a lot of brownies," marveled the woman
responsible for introducing San Marino to brownies of the espresso
chocolate cream cheese variety.</TE>
<TE>   In 2000, an ad hoc parking committee concluded that the area
needed about 61 more off-street parking spaces. The next year, a
consultant offered four pages of short-term fixes and five long-term
solutions, one of which was to "explore the possibility of building a
parking lot or structure in the Mission Business District."</TE>
<TE>   But that would mean taking private land through eminent domain in
a city that is famously conservative. Interim City Manager Rob
Wishner said San Marino had never done such a thing.</TE>
<TE>   Still, the plan for a parking lot moved forward quickly -- too
quickly, opponents say.</TE>
<TE>   The city zeroed in on property at 2410/2420 Mission, a narrow lot
with two houses, one in front of the other.</TE>
<TE>   Walter and Susan Reutimann, who also own the Mission Nursery down
the street, rent out the houses, which they acquired from the city in
1999 as part of a land swap for a former gas station that is now an
office and retail complex at the Mission District's eastern end.</TE>
<TE>   After studying a few potential sites, the city concluded that the
Reutimann property would be "on balance ... the most appropriate site
for this parking lot project," according to a staff report.</TE>
<TE>   The Reutimanns, however, are unwilling to give up their land
easily. They and other critics say that razing the homes would
destroy part of the city's legacy. The houses were built in 1908 and
1909, before San Marino incorporated, and are thought to be among the
oldest in the city.</TE>
<TE>   Before the council meeting, Walter Reutimann said he had never
spoken with city officials about selling his property. The only
communication he had received, he said, was a letter from the city
offering to buy his property for $509,000 -- far less than he and his
neighbors say the homes are worth.</TE>
<TE>   Although it's difficult to find prices for comparable properties,
in part because there are two houses on the lot, other homes in the
area of similar size are for sale for $800,000 and up.</TE>
<TE>   Wishner, who acknowledged that seizing the property "is not the
best resolution," said the city had tried repeatedly to discuss the
issue with Walter Reutimann.</TE>
<TE>   "The mayor and myself paid him a visit at his business.... He just
absolutely doesn't want to consider sale of property," Wishner said.</TE>
<TE>   Opponents of the project say the city unfairly rejected three gas
stations along the street as parking lot sites. At least two them are
for sale. The city says those sites would be too costly or would
yield too few spaces.</TE>
<TE>   For the recent council meeting, opponents arrived with maps and
petitions, fortifying themselves for a battle that might as well have
been against the pending arrival of a 7-Eleven or Wal-Mart. They wore
stickers on their lapels reading: "Homes Not Cars. Stop the Lot."</TE>
<TE>   Paul Van Ness, who lives on the Reutimann property, told the
council that the two Craftsman houses are among the more beautiful
homes in the area -- and unlike the homes of various council members.
"They are not gingerbread, or fake English Tudor," he said. "They're
genuinely beautiful homes."</TE>
<TE>   But other speakers said the city might have no alternative. "We're
talking about getting 40 cars off the street," said Joe Gorman.
"We've talked about it for 17 years. This is the first opportunity to
go forward. Don't let it stop."</TE>
<TE>   But that, in fact, is what did happen.</TE>
<TE>   The owner of Harry's Gas Station, across the street and a few
doors east of the Reutimann lot, has offered to sell his lot,
residents said.</TE>
<TE>   A city report concluded that the $1.8-million cost of building a
two-story, 46-space lot on that site would be prohibitive. But the
lot's owner, Harry Zarougian, is offering to remove the underground
gas tanks from his property, demolish structures and even pave and
stripe the lot with 41 spaces -- for half the cost.</TE>
<TE>   "Walter doesn't want to sell his lot," said Thad King, who pushed
the idea. "Harry does."</TE>
<TE>   Although City Council members had come to the meeting ready to
approve a lot on the Reutimann property, they decided to consider
Zarougian's offer. Two of the five council members were obliged to
recuse themselves from the discussion: Vince Filutze, who lives
within 500 feet of a potential site, and Mayor Emile J. Bayle, whose
business is next door to it.</TE>
<TE>   For now, a huge wooden sign stands outside the houses at 2410/2420
Mission, calling on residents to fight the lot. A stack of fliers
urges residents to take action. And motorists circle the three-block
district, looking for a parking space to call their own.</TE>

<HD>Transit Planners to Seek Funds as Team</HD>
<DH>Focus is on tapping federal funding for projects. But few
elected officials attend.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Kurt Streeter</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It was a message that could have come straight out of the playbook of
the world champion Anaheim Angels: Teamwork wins.</LD>
<LD>   Only this time the message came from a Los Angeles hotel
convention center instead of Edison Field, and the competition is for
federal dollars to fund rail, bus and road projects.</LD>
<LD>   Regional transportation planners Monday repeatedly spoke of the
need for greater teamwork at the Mobility 21 Summit, a daylong
meeting at the Wilshire Grand Hotel that brought together about 400
business and transit leaders, and, notably, just a smattering of
elected officials.</LD>
<TE>   Put on by the Metropolitan Transportation Authority and the Los
Angeles Chamber of Commerce, the summit was a first-of-its-kind
effort to prepare top officials for a full-throttle fight for federal
dollars in Washington.</TE>
<TE>   In years past, MTA officials said, leaders in Los Angeles County
have been far from unified, pleading to Congress for pet projects at
the expense of a wider vision for the county. Balkanized by petty
disputes, the region has suffered through years of anemic funding,
MTA officials contend.</TE>
<TE>   The meeting's focus was next year's federal transportation
spending plan, which will probably release about $180 billion to
local transit agencies for use over five to seven years. The
authorization is vitally important to Los Angeles County, which is
struggling with the nation's most congested traffic and continued
population growth.</TE>
<TE>   Local officials are counting on Congress to help fund a long list
of projects, including expansion of Los Angeles International
Airport, light-rail lines in East and West Los Angeles, and carpool
lanes on the San Diego Freeway.</TE>
<TE>   The teamwork message, which was promoted in speeches and
small-group discussions throughout the day, was well received by
attendees. "In the past we have not been able to speak with one
voice, partly because we've never come together like this," said Rep.
Lucille Roybal-Allard (D-Los Angeles). "This is going to be a big
surprise to my colleagues in Washington. They are used to seeing Los
Angeles divided. That's no longer the case."</TE>
<TE>   Despite Roybal-Allard's confidence, it was hard to miss the fact
that many top officials did not attend.</TE>
<TE>   Invited but absent were U.S. Sens. Dianne Feinstein and Barbara
Boxer, and all but three members of the Los Angeles area's
congressional delegation. Los Angeles City Council members at the
summit were Ed Reyes, Tom LaBonge and Hal Bernson, chairman of the
MTA board. Absent was Los Angeles Mayor James K. Hahn, who has been
criticized in transit circles for a perceived lack of interest in
transportation issues.</TE>
<TE>   Hahn representatives said the summit's date had been changed in
July and conflicted with his 10-day trade mission to Asia, which
began Saturday. Nonetheless, MTA officials in recent days have
expressed unhappiness with Hahn's decision not to attend.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a real disappointment," Roger Snoble, head of the MTA, said
recently.</TE>
<TE>   Despite Hahn's absence, the summit was called a success by Snoble,
who has been emphasizing the need to change the way Los Angeles goes
after federal dollars since he arrived from Dallas one year ago.</TE>
<TE>   Snoble likes to tick off facts that he says show that the Los
Angeles area is shortchanged. The region contributes $1.2 billion in
gasoline taxes and gets back $1 billion for transportation. The
county got $20 million for new rail construction in 2002, compared
with New Jersey's $140 million and San Francisco's $75 million.</TE>
<TE>   Many at the summit acknowledged that boosting local funding will
be difficult in a Washington dominated by Republicans, both in the
White House and in Congress.</TE>
<TE>   "I have my fingers crossed that Mr. Mineta will come through for
us," said Roybal-Allard, speaking of Secretary of Transportation
Norman Y. Mineta, a California Democrat.</TE>
<TE>   Mineta is seen by local officials as one of the few people in the
Bush White House likely to push for Los Angeles County transit
projects.</TE>

<HD>Experts Gaining Ground Against Oil-Rig Inferno</HD>
<DH>Man who died Saturday as the Castaic fire erupted is
identified by officials as a 43-year-old oilfield veteran from
Bakersfield.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Michael Krikorian and Andrew Blankstein</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Texas firefighting experts said Monday that they expect to have a
deadly Castaic oil-rig fire controlled today, three days after an
underground explosion ignited the inferno, killing one man and
critically injuring another.</LD>
<LD>   Officials identified the victim of Saturday's blast as 43-year-old
Joe Currington of Bakersfield, a veteran oilfield worker who was
married and had three children.</LD>
<LD>   His colleague, Delton Rosson, 35, also of Bakersfield, remains at
the Grossman Burn Center at Sherman Oaks Hospital in critical but
stable condition.</LD>
<TE>   A four-member crew employed by Caza Drilling Co. was pulling a
drill bit out of a well Saturday when a plume of natural gas
exploded, toppling a 100-foot-high derrick that melted in the blaze,
authorities said. At the time of the 2 a.m. explosion, Currington was
standing on a 60-foot-high platform on the rig.</TE>
<TE>   "The gases blew upward and there may have been a spark from the
drill bit that ignited the gas," said Susan Gard, a spokeswoman for
the state Division of Occupational Safety and Health.</TE>
<TE>   She said Cal/OSHA has launched an investigation of the accident
that will involve interviewing witnesses, examining equipment, and
studying employee training procedures and maintenance records. But
Gard said the agency's findings would not be available for at least
three months.</TE>
<TE>   "We are in the very preliminary stages of the investigation and
are looking into any violations of health and safety standards," Gard
said.</TE>
<TE>   Because Currington was killed, Los Angeles County sheriff's
detectives investigated the incident to determine whether criminal
actions contributed to the blast. "This was just a tragic accident,"
said sheriff's Det. Steve Davis. "The victim was probably in a tower
above the drilling apparatus and never knew what hit him."</TE>
<TE>   By Monday, the natural-gas-fed fire, which had sent flames
shooting 200 feet into the air, was largely contained.</TE>
<TE>   "They'll get it under control and closed Tuesday," said Raymond
Henry, senior specialist for Boots and Coots International Well
Control based in Houston. "It's already considerably smaller."</TE>
<TE>   Henry said firefighters' first concern was to rid the burn area of
any potential fuel sources that might touch off another explosion.</TE>
<TE>   "The first thing you want to do is clear away all the hot metal
and the debris that could ignite," said Henry. "As long as the fire
is burning, it eliminates chances of explosions or flash fires."</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, a memorial fund has been set up for Currington at the
Bank of Stockdale in Bakersfield.</TE>
<TE>   "We are trying to take care of the family," said Gard, adding that
trauma counselors were being made available to oil-rig employees and
to families of the victims.</TE>

<LD>Security guards and the Los Angeles Fire Department rushed to a USC
fraternity house where a fire alarm had sounded, but "no smoke or
fire was found," the Daily Trojan reported. Cause of the alarm: steam
from a hot shower. I bring this up only to refute the notion that
college guys never bathe.</LD>

<LD>   Talk about a rush-rush society: David Johanssen of Torrance
spotted a time-limit posting that at first glance would seem to
require folks with heart problems to hurry up (see photo). It wasn't
a medical clinic, luckily.</LD>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Food for thought: Susanna Enenstein of West L.A. dined at a
restaurant where "my husband and I enjoyed fairly good service. It
wasn't until we received the bill that we wondered if we somehow
offended our server early on. Apparently, we were lucky just to get
our soup and bread" (see accompanying).</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   On the 37th night before Christmas...: "Who goofed?" asked Don
Barrett's laradio.com Web site. That's also what a couple of
listeners of KOST-FM (103.5) wanted to know last week. They phoned to
complain that the radio station wasn't playing holiday tunes as
promised on its new freeway billboards (see accompanying).</TE>
<TE>   Yup, they just had to complain.</TE>
<TE>   So the station hastily kicked the format into gear on Sunday, and
now we get five weeks of the stuff instead of four, as advertised.
Next thing you know, Rudolph and his friends will be crashing into
someone buying a Thanksgiving turkey.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I mean, didn't we just get through, with ... what do you call that
other celebration? Oh, that's right, Halloween. Arlene Bernholtz of
West Hills spotted the most unusual safety tip given to parents this
year (see accompanying).</TE>

<TE>   miscelLAny: In the never-ending name game, Fay Anderson points out
that a former DWP general manager has been appointed project manager
for a group working to improve the water quality of Lake Arrowhead.
His very appropriate name: Dan Waters.</TE>
<TE>   And, adds Anderson, a Lake Arrowhead resident, the area has had
rangers named Doug Forrest and Bob Wood.</TE>
<TE>   San Diego Magazine editor Tom Blair, meanwhile, wonders if San

<LD>A skilled nursing home at the Tustin Hospital and Medical Center has
been fined $90,000 and given the state's most severe citation in the
death of a 7-year-old boy there in June, state officials said Monday.</LD>
<LD>   The boy, who had been admitted 18 months earlier with a traumatic
brain injury, was undergoing a breathing treatment through an
incision in his upper chest. The therapist left for about 10 minutes,
said Ken August, a spokesman for the state Department of Health
Services. When he returned, the breathing apparatus was disconnected
and the patient was dead.</LD>

<HD>Rescuer-in-Training Gets Some Real-Life Experience</HD>
<DH>Nineteen-year-old sailor jumps from hovering helicopter to
aid downed pilot who was forced to eject off Baja California.</DH>

<DL>SAN DIEGO</DL>
<LD>Navy Petty Officer 3rd Class Richard Pentony was back at work Monday,
training to rescue downed pilots at sea by jumping out of a hovering
helicopter.</LD>
<LD>   But the 19-year-old from Vernon, N.J., now knows that he has what
it takes to get the job done.</LD>
<LD>   Pentony was aboard a SH-60F Seahawk helicopter on a training
mission Thursday morning about 10 miles off the Baja California coast
when a pilot of an F/A-18D Hornet from Miramar Marine Corps Air
Station was forced to eject a few miles away.</LD>
<TE>   Within minutes, the big helicopter, part of the Warhawks squadron
at North Island Naval Air Station, was over the crash site.</TE>
<TE>   Waves were littered with debris, and the sea was covered with a
thin film of jet fuel.</TE>
<TE>   Air Force Capt. Michael Suermann, groggy but conscious, was in a
small raft, bobbing in the water. He had set off a rescue flare and
was waving to draw attention.</TE>
<TE>   Donning his wetsuit, Pentony jumped into the choppy seas, a drop
of about 10 feet, and swam the 30 yards to Suermann.</TE>
<TE>   "The training just kind of kicked in," Pentony said, "and I went
to work."</TE>
<TE>   Suermann, part of an Air Force-Marine pilot exchange program,
expressed surprise at how quickly the rescue helicopter arrived. The
helicopter, which had backed off to reduce the turbulence caused by
its rotors, returned and dropped a rescue hook.</TE>
<TE>   "I hooked myself to him and signaled for the hoist," Pentony said.</TE>
<TE>   "He was alert but a little shaken. It was all very fast, maybe 10
minutes."</TE>
<TE>   Suermann was covered with warm blankets, and within minutes the
helicopter had landed at the Balboa Naval Hospital in San Diego. He
was released within hours, shaken but not injured.</TE>
<TE>   A military investigation into the crash will take months. During
that time, Suermann is restricted from talking to the media.</TE>
<TE>   Pentony, who gained his love of the water as a surfer on the New
Jersey shore, is now in select company.</TE>
<TE>   Helicopter Anti-Submarine Squadron 10 has trained more than 10,000
personnel in its 38-year history, but executed only about 100 rescues
off Southern California.</TE>
<TE>   "I had an adrenaline rush for about a day," he said.</TE>

seeking to delay his sentencing.</LD>

<LD>Several species of sea life were found dead at Santa Barbara Harbor
over the last several days, leading wildlife officials to examine the
waters for toxins.</LD>
<LD>   Among the dead were halibut, perch, turbot and rockfish.
Biologists also found dead lobster and two types of crabs.</LD>
<LD>   A preliminary test of the water ruled out domoic acid and red
tide. Runoff from the storms two weeks ago had been suggested as a
possible cause, but it was ruled out because the deaths began
occurring only over the weekend, an official said.</LD>

<HD>Rap Producer's Associates Free as Probe Continues</HD>
<DH>Investigators are still sifting through data. Officer cites
state law that requires formal charges within 48 hours of arrest.</DH>

<BD>From a Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department on Monday freed three
associates of Death Row Records founder Marion "Suge" Knight who were
accused of conspiring to kill a gang rival.</LD>
<LD>   Lt. Bob Rifkin said Monday that the three, who were picked up
during a sweeping raid Thursday, were freed pending further
investigation.</LD>
<LD>   Rifkin said they had to be released because state law prohibits
authorities from keeping suspects in custody for more than 48 hours
without filing formal charges against them. "There is just a plethora
of evidence to sift through," he said.</LD>
<TE>   The three were former Los Angeles Sheriff's Deputy Kordell Depree
Knox, 37, and two reputed gang members, Michael Payne, 25, and
Theodore Kelly, 29.</TE>
<TE>   They were accused of conspiracy in connection with the June 7
killing of reputed gang rival Eric Letheal Daniel, 29, in revenge for
the death of another Knight associate who was gunned down in April.</TE>
<TE>   Two others were picked up during last week's raid on unrelated
drug possession charges. One of those, DeShone Lacey, also was
released, while the other, Darryl Small, was held in custody on an
out-of-state probation violation, Rifkin said.</TE>
<TE>   The raid involved 16 sites, including the Wilshire Boulevard
offices of Tha Row, formerly Death Row Records, and Knight's homes.</TE>
<TE>   Sheriff's officials have said Knight is not a suspect in their
investigation, which focuses on a string of gang killings, including
several in which the victims were Knight employees or associates.</TE>

<HD>Antonovich Backs Moving Old Oak</HD>
<DH>Doing as the supervisor suggests will kill the tree, says
an activist who has spent weeks sitting in its branches near Santa
Clarita.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Richard Fausset and Carol Chambers</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Hoping to end a standoff with environmentalists, Los Angeles County
Supervisor Mike Antonovich on Monday ordered that a 400-year-old oak
tree that stands in the way of a road-widening project near Santa
Clarita be moved to a different location.</LD>
<LD>   "It can be moved, and we'll be moving it to an appropriate site,"
Antonovich said. "I don't [know] why this option wasn't explored in
the beginning."</LD>
<LD>   But John Quigley, the activist who has spent nearly three weeks
camped atop the towering oak as part of a campaign to save it, said
he doesn't believe the supervisor's plan will work. He said an
arborist for the city of Santa Clarita inspected the tree earlier
this month and concluded that moving it would constitute a "death
sentence."</LD>
<TE>   "I think it's a positive gesture that [Antonovich] has come out
publicly that he'd like to keep the tree alive," Quigley said. "But
we believe that moving the tree will not achieve that."</TE>
<TE>   As a result, Quigley said, he will not climb down from his perch.</TE>
<TE>   Antonovich, who represents the Santa Clarita Valley, said he made
his decision to relocate the tree after consulting Monday with
officials from public works and John Laing Homes, the developer of a
nearby subdivision that is required by its building permit to widen
the roadway next to the tree.</TE>
<TE>   The moving job would be done by Calabasas-based Valley Crest Tree
Co., and would cost the developer about $250,000, officials said. It
has not been decided where the tree would be moved, but Antonovich
said it would stay in the Santa Clarita Valley.</TE>
<TE>   Antonovich said he made his decision after Valley Crest arborists
assured him the tree would survive the move.</TE>
<TE>   John Mote, an arborist and former employee of the company, said
Valley Crest has a good track record: Beginning in 1988, the company
moved more than 2,400 live oaks off the site of a planned luxury home
development at Lake Sherwood in Ventura County.</TE>
<TE>   Mote said more than 90% of those trees survived the move,
including some that were centuries old. He said the Santa Clarita oak
could also survive if the root system, which would be badly damaged
by a move, is carefully maintained.</TE>
<TE>   "A big old tree like that? It's going to be in intensive care for
decades," Mote said. "But then it's probably going to make it."</TE>
<TE>   Many arborists, biologists and developers disagree over whether
transplanting oak trees is worth the cost. While some say the trees
have a good chance of survival, others argue that relocations are
often a way to simply quiet activists who oppose construction
projects.</TE>
<TE>   Pat Duff, a certified arborist and owner of ArborTender in Covina,
said she has seen pictures of the tree in Pico Canyon near Santa
Clarita and believes it has a poor chance of surviving.</TE>
<TE>   "That tree is not in good condition," Duff said. "From what I've
seen, its habitat has been pretty severely disturbed."</TE>
<TE>   After taking up residence in the stately oak, nicknamed Old Glory,
Quigley has generated national media attention and become a hero to
scores of neighborhood children who chant his name nightly. He has
even received fan mail at his new home.</TE>
<TE>   On Monday, a U.S. Postal Service mail carrier delivered a letter
to Quigley at the tree site. The letter, from one of his supporters,
was addressed to Mr. Quigley, Tree #419, Stevenson Ranch, Calif.
91381.</TE>
<TE>   Author C. Macauley wrote that what Quigley was doing had "struck a
chord" with the writer, and that "no greedy, thoughtless developer
should have a right to destroy" the tree.</TE>
<TE>   But so far, the developer has refused to bring trespassing charges
against Quigley.</TE>
<TE>   The Santa Clarita environmental group that recruited Quigley for
the tree demonstration wants the county to reconsider widening Pico
Canyon Road.</TE>
<TE>   If not, they want the road to be built around the tree.</TE>
<TE>   Bob Haueter, Antonovich's senior deputy, said he was dismayed by
Quigley's refusal to come down from the tree.</TE>
<TE>   "There may be a difference of opinion here, but the bottom line
is, if he wants this tree to be saved, we've given him an option to
save it," Haueter said.</TE>
<TE>   He added that officials haven't yet figured out how to get Quigley
down from the tree.</TE>
<TE>   "I guess we'll deal with that when we get to that point," Haueter
said.</TE>

<HD>USC Is No. 1 for Foreign Students</HD>
<DH>Nearly 6,000 students, or 20% of enrollment, are from
overseas, the most in the U.S. Also ranking high was two- year Santa
Monica College.</DH>

<LD>USC, which has made international recruitment a mainstay of its
admissions strategy, is the nation's leader in enrolling foreign
students, according to a survey by the New York-based Institute of
International Education.</LD>
<LD>   The university moved up from second place in the same ranking a
year earlier, mainly because of a surge in applications from India,
China and other Asian countries. It switched positions with last
year's leader, New York University.</LD>
<LD>   The ranking was based on the overall number of foreign
undergraduate and graduate students during the school year that began
in fall 2001. As a result, the figures were little affected by the
tightened U.S. visa-granting procedures adopted after the Sept. 11
terrorist attacks.</LD>
<TE>   Officials with USC and the institute predicted that figures for
the current school year will show continuing growth in foreign
enrollment.</TE>
<TE>   For foreign students, "the fundamentals haven't changed. America
is still the No. 1 education destination of choice," said Allan
Goodman, president and chief executive of the Institute of
International Education, a nonprofit educational exchange group.</TE>
<TE>   Dixon C. Johnson, executive director of USC's Office of
International Services, said a relatively small number of the
university's foreign students come from the Middle East or other
heavily Muslim countries, the nations whose students have faced the
greatest difficulties obtaining U.S. student visas this year.</TE>
<TE>   In the ranking, USC reported that 5,950 of its 29,815 enrolled
students in the 2001-02 school year -- or 20% -- were foreign
nationals, up from 5,321, or 18.5%, the year before.</TE>
<TE>   This year's figures also showed an increasingly heavy enrollment
of foreign students in community colleges. In California -- which for
45 consecutive years has drawn more foreign students than any other
state -- the school with the second-largest number of foreign
students was Santa Monica College, a two-year school. It ranked 27th
nationally, with 3,074 foreign students, or 11% of its student body.</TE>
<TE>   Small and medium-sized private universities tended to have the
highest percentages of foreign students because, unlike state
universities or community colleges, they are not under a mandate to
serve local students.</TE>
<TE>   Rounding out the list of California schools in the nation's top 40
were Stanford, in 31st place, with 2,922 foreign students (20.5%);
UCLA, 33rd, with 2,794 (7.6%); UC Berkeley, 36th, with 2,735 (8.5%);
and San Francisco State, 40th, with 2,566 (9.6%).</TE>
<TE>   Educators say large foreign enrollments help schools improve their
rankings because they tend to bring in more highly qualified
students. At the same time, they say, foreign students improve the
education of U.S. students by exposing them to other cultures. Also,
because foreign undergraduate and master's degree students normally
receive little or no financial aid, they can provide a revenue boost
for U.S. colleges and universities.</TE>

<DL>LHOKSEUMAWE, Indonesia</DL>
<LD>Separatist rebels in Aceh province will sign a peace deal with the
Indonesian government Dec. 9 to end 26 years of fighting that has
killed thousands of people, international mediators said today.</LD>
<LD>   The word came from the Geneva-based Henry Dunant Center for
Humanitarian Dialogue, which has facilitated talks between the two
sides since 2000.</LD>
<LD>   The proposed peace plan offers more autonomy for the province's 4
million inhabitants and elections for a provincial legislature and
administration. A 150-member team of international monitors,
including ex-military officers from Europe and Asia, would oversee
the arrangement.</LD>
<TE>   A peace deal could end one of Asia's longest-running wars. The
rebellion against Jakarta has lasted since 1976. At least 12,000
people -- mostly civilians -- have died since 1990, including nearly
2,000 this year.</TE>

<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>An audiotape broadcast last week is an authentic, unedited and recent
recording of Osama bin Laden, U.S. intelligence officials said Monday
after completing a technical and linguistic analysis.</LD>
<LD>   The CIA and National Security Agency, which conducted the study,
concluded the tape is what it seems: the Al Qaeda leader himself,
reading a statement that promises new terrorism against the U.S.</LD>
<LD>   The tape, broadcast on the Qatar-based Al Jazeera television
network, praised attacks that took place recently and is the hardest
evidence since December 2001 that Bin Laden survived the U.S. bombing
campaign in Afghanistan.</LD>
<TE>   "Our intelligence experts do believe that the tape is genuine. It
cannot be stated with 100% certainty. It is clear that the tape was
made in the last several weeks," White House spokesman Scott
McClellan said.</TE>
<TE>   The audio message gives little clue to Bin Laden's location or his
health. Some intelligence officials have wondered if he used audio
rather than video to conceal injuries or sickness.</TE>

<DL>CARACAS, Venezuela</DL>
<LD>Venezuelan national guard troops firing tear gas and shotgun pellets
skirmished for a second straight day Monday with demonstrators
angered by President Hugo Chavez's militarization of the Caracas
police.</LD>
<LD>   Four people were wounded by shotgun pellets after the heavily
armed troops riding motorcycles and wearing gas masks swooped in on
protesters blocking major highways in the eastern part of the
capital.</LD>
<LD>   After scattering to avoid the gas, the protesters regrouped and
briefly set up barricades of burning tires and garbage.</LD>
<TE>   Chavez said he sent in the army during the weekend because Mayor
Alfredo Pena, a political foe of the president, had lost control of
the police. But rather than imposing order, the takeover only
deepened the chaos in the Venezuelan capital, where political
fighting between Chavez and those who want him ousted has fostered
increasing unrest.</TE>
<TE>   Monday, police didn't know whom to report to: Gonzalo Sanchez
Delgado -- a retired sergeant appointed by Chavez -- or Police Chief
Henry Vivas, a 30-year veteran who refused to resign. Patrol officers
peered from precinct windows at army soldiers equipped with machine
guns.</TE>

<HD>Chemical Arms' Effects Linger Long After War</HD>
<DH>Iranian victims of Iraqi attacks, both soldiers and
civilians, are still suffering and dying 14 years after the nations'
war ended.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Robin Wright</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>KARAJ, Iran</DL>
<LD>His frail body perched on a pillow, Ali Shakiebeinejad whispered a
few words at a time through a green plastic mask connected to an
oxygen canister.</LD>
<LD>   "I first noticed the beautiful smell. It was sweet, like garlic or
roses," the former shoe repairman recalled. A deep racking cough
interrupted him. "But I didn't know what it was."</LD>
<LD>   Then only 19, the Iranian was too preoccupied with the rout of his
military unit and his impending capture by the Iraqis. And for the
next 27 months he was a prisoner of war.</LD>
<TE>   Five years ago, the growing number of unusual symptoms -- a
worsening cough, constant respiratory infections, gum disease that
caused his teeth to fall out, pounding headaches and excessive weight
loss -- were finally diagnosed. Doctors told Shakiebeinejad that he
was a victim of mustard gas, the chemical weapon most used by Iraq
during its eight-year war with Iran.</TE>
<TE>   Fourteen years after the war's end, Shakiebeinejad represents the
lingering -- and in many cases unanticipated -- impact of Iraq's use
of chemical weapons. Fears that Iraq might still have such weapons of
mass destruction -- from mustard gas to nerve agents such as Tabun to
a nuclear weapons program -- drove the U.N. Security Council on Nov.
8 to unanimously approve a resolution calling on Iraqi President
Saddam Hussein's regime to disarm or face "serious consequences."</TE>
<TE>   In a declassified report, the CIA estimated in 1991 that Iran
suffered more than 50,000 casualties, including untold thousands of
deaths, from Iraq's use of several chemical weapons. But Iran claims
the tally has since soared, as both troops and civilians have
developed the telltale symptoms up to 15 years later because low-dose
exposure deferred physical deterioration or collapse.</TE>
<TE>   "We are beginning to understand that we may only have seen the tip
of the iceberg. We may not yet have seen the majority of victims,"
said Dr. Farhad Hashemnezhad, a young pulmonary specialist who has
reluctantly become an expert on chemical weapons.</TE>
<TE>   "Many patients don't know that their complaints -- coughing,
tightness in the chest, difficult respiration -- have anything to do
with chemical weapons, especially after all these years," the doctor
said. "At least 20% of the current patients are civilians who didn't
think they were close enough to be exposed."</TE>
<TE>   One of the common causes of civilian casualties was use of water
contaminated by chemical weapons, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Doctors became so concerned by the growing number of cases that
the government two years ago started putting ads in Iranian papers
calling on anyone who had been in specified areas during the war to
report to one of the nation's 30 centers for the disabled and get
medical checkups. What the ads didn't say, to avoid panic, was that
the areas had been hit by Iraqi chemical weapons.</TE>
<TE>   Shakiebeinejad, who at 33 weighs only 107 pounds, is not expected
to live more than six months, doctors have told his wife. His closest
army buddy during the battle at Al Shalamshah died several weeks ago.</TE>
<TE>   "There are more and more like him. They're like candles, day by
day they're melting," said Mohammed Aliani, deputy director of the
Center for the Disabled here in Karaj, an industrial city about 25
miles northwest of Tehran.</TE>
<TE>   At the Sasan Hospital in Tehran, Mohsen Kompany, a former car
mechanic, resembles an emaciated concentration camp survivor: yellow
skin tightly covering jutting bones. He too is permanently attached
to oxygen. Kompany, 34, remembers the smell of newly mown grass when
the Iraqis dropped mustard gas bombs on his army unit. But he
remembers little else, as he has the memory of an early Alzheimer's
patient. Doctors say he will die any day.</TE>
<TE>   Like most of the current cases, Kompany was targeted in the last
two years of the war. Iraq first began developing its
chemical-weapons capability in the early 1970s, deliberately
enrolling students in foreign schools with the goal of developing "a
pool of technically competent scientists," according to a second
declassified CIA report.</TE>
<TE>   But Iraq was often clumsy in its early usage of the weapons
between 1983 and 1986, U.S. intelligence says. The Iraqi military
frequently fired chemical-laden artillery shells or dropped bombs in
unsuitable weather, "with wind carrying the agent toward their own
troops," the CIA report says. Pilots also released bombs and rockets
from altitudes too high to have much impact or too low for their
fuses to function.</TE>
<TE>   By late 1986, however, Iraq was boldly using chemical weapons as
an "integral part" of its battlefield strategy and a "regular and
recurring tactic," the CIA reported. The only constraint was
availability -- a problem Iraq worked hard to remedy.</TE>
<TE>   In 1988, the use of several chemical weapons became a decisive
factor in the grisly war, eventually forcing Iran to agree to a
U.N.-brokered cease-fire. Iran's ill-equipped medical staff couldn't
cope with the numbers, and many efforts to help produced "secondary
contamination" among both transporters and medical staff, the CIA
said.</TE>
<TE>   Esmail Khoshnevisan, who suffers from serious shakes, respiratory
failure and gum disease that has taken his teeth, was an ambulance
driver during the war near strategic Majnoun Island. Bedridden for a
year, he is in the final phase of respiratory disease at Sasan
Hospital because of exposure to mustard gas.</TE>
<TE>   Khoshnevisan's son, 13 at the time, was also in Majnoun and now
suffers from disabling respiratory disease.</TE>
<TE>   Baghdad used both liquid and dry forms of mustard gas, a weapon
first employed during World War I and later by Italy in Ethiopia and
by Egypt in Yemen. It evaporates slowly and can remain dangerous for
many hours, even days, according to the Stockholm International Peace
Research Institute. It burns body tissue and acts as a systemic
poison deadlier than cyanide, resulting in blindness, severe
blistering, skin discoloration and lung damage, as the ailments among
patients at Sasan demonstrate.</TE>
<TE>   Midway through the war with Iran, Iraq also introduced the nerve
agent Tabun for the first time in any conflict. It can immediately
trigger vomiting, twitching, convulsions and paralysis.</TE>
<TE>   Iranians are somewhat bitter that the world is only now beginning
to pay attention to their problems caused by Iraq's chemical weapons.</TE>
<TE>   "At the time, nobody spoke of the dangers. And it took a lot of
time to convince the United Nations to come and verify our claims.
Now it's all people want to talk about. It's a little late, but it's
better than nothing," said Foreign Ministry spokesman Hamid Reza
Asefi.</TE>
<TE>   If Washington opts to confront Hussein's regime militarily, U.S.
troops would be both better trained and better protected against
chemical or biological agents. According to Iranian and U.S.
officials, many Iranian soldiers had no access to protective masks,
while others who did weren't protected because the masks didn't fit
over their beards, which were virtually required after Iran's 1979
Islamic revolution.</TE>
<TE>   But in an uncanny foreshadowing of the Bush administration's own
dilemma in planning, U.S. intelligence concluded during the Iran-Iraq
war that "if Iran were to threaten Iraqi perceived strategic
positions, we believe that Iraq might authorize massive chemical
employments," according to the second declassified CIA report.</TE>
<TE>   "No political or religious constraints seem to bear seriously on
Hussein's decision to employ chemical weapons," the report adds.
"International and regional pressure ... demarches and export
controls have been ineffective in stopping the development of
chemical weapons."</TE>

<DL>PARIS</DL>
<LD>PARIS -- With police across Europe on guard against a heightened
threat of attack, a British court Monday ordered three Algerians,
including an alleged senior Al Qaeda figure, held on suspicion of
terrorist activity. French police made three more arrests in a
separate case.</LD>
<LD>   Authorities say their security forces have stepped up activity
because of indications that Al Qaeda intends to strike in Europe,
where it has recruited fighters and planned operations -- but has not
successfully carried out an attack. Recent warnings, some concrete
and others vague, have generated fear of a major attack in Britain,
France or another nation.</LD>
<LD>   "I think the threat in Europe is the highest it has been since
Sept. 11," a top French law enforcement official said Monday.</LD>
<TE>   British authorities gave few details about the case against the
Algerians, whom a judge ordered held for a month without bail pending
investigation of suspected "preparation, instigation or commission of
terrorism."</TE>
<TE>   But officials denied media reports that the three had been
planning a poison gas attack on London's subway system.</TE>
<TE>   "It doesn't appear to be that there is any evidence whatsoever
there was going to be a gas attack or indeed use of bombs regarding
the three people who have been arrested," Deputy Prime Minister John
Prescott said in an interview with the BBC.</TE>
<TE>   One of the suspects, Rabah Kadre, is a heavyweight in Europe-wide
Al Qaeda groups based in London, according to French and Belgian
investigators. Kadre, 35, was a close associate of Abu Doha, the
alleged leader of an Algerian-dominated network and accused
mastermind of a failed attempt to bomb Los Angeles International
Airport in 1999, investigators say.</TE>
<TE>   Kadre also was an active recruiter sending French Muslims to
Afghan training camps, according to authorities.</TE>
<TE>   British police arrested Abu Doha and Kadre in February 2001 as
they attempted to leave London for Saudi Arabia, according to Italian
court documents. Abu Doha was held on terrorism charges. Kadre, who
was suspected of an immigration violation, was released, according to
authorities.</TE>
<TE>   Kadre allegedly assumed Abu Doha's duties as a leading figure in
the mostly Algerian and Tunisian networks that are trying to regroup
despite a police crackdown since the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks,
investigators say.</TE>
<TE>   British police arrested Kadre again Nov. 9 along with Rabah
Chehaj-Bias, 21, and Karim Kadouri, 33, both described as unemployed
Algerians living in London. After spending time in Slovakia with a
fraudulent French passport, Kadre returned to Britain a few days
before his arrest, according to Slovak authorities and media reports.</TE>
<TE>   Official silence contributed to a climate of confusion in London,
where authorities were trying to strike a balance between alerting
the public and preventing panic.</TE>
<TE>   Commuters were greeted by tabloid headlines about an aborted
chemical attack on the sprawling underground transit system, known
popularly as the tube, but officials said the stories were
groundless. Defense lawyers said their clients had not even been
questioned about a possible subway plot.</TE>
<TE>   Investigations in Afghanistan and elsewhere have demonstrated that
Al Qaeda has experimented with primitive chemical weapons, a
recurring topic in wiretaps and intelligence reports.</TE>
<TE>   "Afghanistan showed they have the capability to use amateurish
devices," said private investigator Jean-Charles Brisard, who
investigated Al Qaeda for a French intelligence service and now works
for families of Sept. 11 victims who have sued Saudi Arabian
officials and companies for allegedly supporting terror.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't know if they are able to use complex devices in terms of
chemical weapons," Brisard said. "We have seen primitive but
dangerous weapons."</TE>
<TE>   The uncertainty and fear in Britain were exacerbated during the
last two weeks. In an interview with a French newspaper earlier this
month, the secretary-general of Interpol warned that Al Qaeda was
preparing major simultaneous attacks in several countries.</TE>
<TE>   French and Dutch intelligence services have reported picking up
intelligence about possible terrorist plans to hit a British port
with an explosives-laden truck on a ferryboat.</TE>
<TE>   British Prime Minister Tony Blair and his home secretary, David
Blunkett, warned last week of an intensified Al Qaeda menace.</TE>
<TE>   "Barely a day goes by without some new piece of intelligence
coming via our security services about a threat to U.K. interests,"
Blair said.</TE>
<TE>   The Home Office released a report last week warning that Al Qaeda
might attempt to use poison gas or a radioactive "dirty bomb." But
shortly afterward, British officials substituted for that alert a
report containing milder, more generic language.</TE>
<TE>   Europeans have been further distressed by threats made in an
audiotape attributed to Osama bin Laden that surfaced last week.</TE>
<TE>   The voice on the tape hailed recent attacks by Islamic extremists
in Yemen, Bali and Moscow and went on to single out Britain, France,
Germany and Italy as enemies.</TE>
<TE>   "In the European environment, there is a much higher level of
concern," said a U.S. official based in Europe. "The naming of names
of countries by Osama bin Laden threw people."</TE>
<TE>   Weakened by the U.S. military offensive in Afghanistan and a
crackdown worldwide, Al Qaeda and its affiliates have gone after
European targets of opportunity in the Middle East and South Asia. A
car bomb killed 11 French engineers in Karachi, Pakistan, in May, and
a truck bomb killed a score of people, mostly German and French
tourists, outside a historic synagogue on the Tunisian island of
Djerba in April.</TE>
<TE>   But even after the Sept. 11 attacks, some experts said it was
unlikely Al Qaeda would attempt a major strike in Europe -- with the
possible exception of France, a longtime target because of its
colonial history in North Africa.</TE>
<TE>   European law enforcement officials seem to have stayed on top of
the networks that operate in Europe, and police have apparently
broken up the few plots that got underway. Al Qaeda also has been
thought to want to keep a lower profile in Europe so it can continue
to use the continent as a base for recruiting, indoctrination and
logistics.</TE>
<TE>   "There was this perception that nothing will happen in Europe
because it provides too much cover," the U.S. official said. "That
doesn't exist anymore."</TE>
<TE>   The actual increase in the menace is hard to measure. France's
interior minister and others have cautioned that the heightened
vigilance does not mean that an attack is imminent. There are fears
that terrorists might want to use the approaching Christmas holidays
as a backdrop. The U.S. official said Europeans also are concerned
about a possible attack somewhere on the continent during this week's
North Atlantic Treaty Organization summit in Prague, the capital of
the Czech Republic.</TE>
<TE>   The bloodiest Islamic terrorist campaign in Europe in the last
decade occurred in 1995 in Paris, where Algeria's Armed Islamic Group
bombed subway and train stations. The organization later became part
of Al Qaeda.</TE>
<TE>   Subways remain a worry. In Brussels last year, authorities learned
that a security guard employed by the subway system had allegedly
undergone training at an Al Qaeda camp in Afghanistan. Last month,
Italian police wiretaps revealed that suspected terrorists in Milan
had talked about an act that would leave "300 or 400 dead on the
subway."</TE>
<TE>   A French investigation this month has revealed the role of
surviving European networks in Al Qaeda's counterattack on the West.
French police Monday rounded up two men and a woman in the Belleville
neighborhood in Paris as part of a probe of a network involved in the
Djerba synagogue attack. The suspects, Tunisians from the same
family, brought the total number of arrests in the case to six.</TE>
<TE>   The suicide bomber in the Djerba case, a Tunisian immigrant who
had lived in Lyon, France, allegedly got his orders by satellite
phone from a top Al Qaeda leader in Karachi. And he had help from a
support network in France, Germany and Spain, according to
investigators.</TE>

<HD>Hamas Vows More Attacks Like One in Hebron</HD>
<DH>In neighboring Syria, a member of the militant Palestinian
group calls the West Bank assault that killed 12 Israelis a military
operation.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>John Daniszewski</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>DAMASCUS, Syria</DL>
<LD>The radical group Hamas has vowed to continue attacks like the one
that killed 12 Israelis in the West Bank last week despite calls that
Palestinian groups show restraint in the run-up to Israeli elections
to give more moderate politicians a chance to win.</LD>
<LD>   Mousa abu Marzouk, in an interview in the group's office here over
the weekend, claimed that Hamas planned the attack that took the
lives of nine Israeli solders and border patrolmen and three armed
guards from the Kiryat Arba Jewish settlement on the outskirts of the
city of Hebron. It was one of the worst recent losses for Israeli
forces. Sixteen Israelis were also wounded in a three-hour gun
battle, and three Palestinian attackers were killed.</LD>
<LD>   Rather than discouraging Jewish settlers in the overwhelmingly
Arab city, the attack prompted a decision to dig in and establish a
settlement to link Kiryat Arba and Hebron's small Jewish settlement
near the Cave of the Patriarchs, a site holy to Muslims and Jews as
the traditional burying place of Abraham. On Monday, settlers claimed
a key road between the two locations.</LD>
<TE>   Marzouk asserted that the Hebron attack was a military operation
aimed at soldiers and not directed at Jewish worshipers returning
from Sabbath prayers, as reported originally by Israeli officials.</TE>
<TE>   Another group, Islamic Jihad, had claimed responsibility for the
attack, but Marzouk insisted that it was Hamas that monitored
movements of soldiers outside the settlement for more than two weeks
in planning the assault.</TE>
<TE>   "They drew the Israelis into an ambush, and the gunfight erupted,"
he said. Islamic Jihad gunmen joined in and three of them were
killed, he said, while the two Hamas fighters involved escaped with
one of them wounded, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Islamic Jihad maintains a low profile at its offices here and will
not talk to Western journalists.</TE>
<TE>   Hamas, which operates an information office in a dense quarter of
Damascus that is home to many Palestinian refugees, said attacks such
as the one in Hebron would continue until Israeli forces and settlers
left the West Bank, the Gaza Strip, East Jerusalem and all
territories that came under Israeli control in the 1967 Middle East
War.</TE>
<TE>   A meeting in Cairo last week between Hamas and members of Yasser
Arafat's Palestinian Authority did not produce any agreement to halt
Hamas suicide operations or ambushes, said Marzouk, who denied that
the Palestinian Authority had made any such request.</TE>
<TE>   Marzouk conceded that attacks like the one in Hebron would have
the effect of strengthening the Likud Party and other right-wing
forces in Israel by "a little percentage." But he added, "When you
talk about the Palestinian problem, there is not much difference
between Labor and Likud.</TE>
<TE>   "We will not suspend our operations during the election campaign,
or after, or before," he said. "We have only one condition: that
Israel should leave our land and let us live freely like other
peoples."</TE>
<TE>   Unlike the Palestinian Authority, Hamas does not recognize
Israel's right to exist on any part of its territory. But Marzouk
said that fighting would stop if Israel returned to the territory it
held before the 1967 war.</TE>
<TE>   Since the current intifada began in the Palestinian territories
more than two years ago, there have been many calls for Syria to shut
down offices in Damascus of extremist Palestinian groups such as
Hamas. On Monday, the United States urged Syria to close the Islamic
Jihad office.</TE>
<TE>   But Marzouk said Syria is unlikely to act because it agrees that
Palestinians have the right to resist occupation. However, he said,
the groups are barred from any kind of military activity on Syrian
soil and must limit themselves to propaganda and information
services.</TE>
<TE>   An editorial Sunday in Beirut's Daily Star newspaper urged Arabs
to show their preference in the upcoming Israeli elections by sending
signals of support for the likely Labor candidate, Amram Mitzna.</TE>
<TE>   "What would help is a clear message from the Arab world that
Israeli voters have much to gain by backing him," it said.</TE>

<HD>14 Die in Bus Blast in India</HD>
<DH>Police blame Maoist rebels for land mine attack that also
injures many passengers.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>HYDERABAD, India</DL>
<LD>A land mine exploded under a passenger bus Monday as it traveled
through a dense forest in southern India, killing at least 14 people,
police said.</LD>
<LD>   The bus was destroyed in the attack, about 125 miles north of
Hyderabad, capital of Andhra Pradesh state. After the blast, the
attackers -- believed to be Maoist guerrillas -- opened fire on the
flaming wreckage, apparently mistaking it for a police transport,
said Gautam Swang, deputy inspector general of police in the Warangal
district.</LD>
<LD>   No police were aboard the bus, Swang said.</LD>
<TE>   He said that the bus was carrying more than 40 passengers and that
at least 14 were killed. The survivors were taken to the nearest
village, but there was no doctor there, he said. At least 16 people
were injured.</TE>
<TE>   Swang blamed the leftist People's War Group, which mostly targets
rich landowners, police and government officials. The group claims to
be inspired by the ideology of Chinese revolutionary leader Mao
Tse-tung.</TE>
<TE>   Police had been patrolling the forest area Monday after exchanging
fire with rebels over the weekend. At least five rebels were killed
Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   The rebels are fighting for an independent homeland in five
southern Indian states. More than 6,000 people have died in the
fighting since 1981.</TE>
<TE>   The group announced a unilateral cease-fire earlier this year, but
it called it off in July, accusing the government of failing to
restrain police from attacking guerrilla camps.</TE>

<HD>Students in Iran Clash With Regime Backers</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL>TEHRAN</DL>
<LD>Fistfights broke out Monday between supporters of Iran's Islamic
regime and university students who issued a rare public criticism of
Iran's supreme leader during a rally in support of a history
professor sentenced to death.</LD>
<LD>   The students organized the demonstration at Sharif Technical
University in Tehran to support reformist scholar Hashem Aghajari,
who was found guilty of insulting the prophet Muhammad. About 3,000
students chanted slogans calling for freedom of speech and accusing
hard-line clerics of thwarting President Mohammad Khatami's political
and social reform programs.</LD>
<LD>   Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei ordered a review of
Aghajari's case Sunday in an apparent effort to defuse such protests.
Analysts said Khamenei's intervention revealed how concerned the
leadership had been about the student protests.</LD>
<TE>   Some student leaders responded to Khamenei's move by ordering an
end to the protests. But others boosted their demands to include an
apology from judiciary chief Ayatollah Mahmoud Hashemi Shahroudi.</TE>
<TE>   "We will continue to protest till Shahroudi officially apologizes
and there is a guarantee no one will be jailed because of what they
say," student leader Saeed Razavi Faqih said.</TE>
<TE>   When the students criticized Khamenei and called for a referendum
on reform programs, about 700 supporters of the regime who were
standing by rushed the students.</TE>

<HD>A Last Stand by the Jews in Egypt</HD>
<DH>Fewer than 200 remain in Arab nation, where a small group
is trying to hold on to artifacts.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>David Lamb</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>CAIRO</DL>
<LD>From scores of mosques, the muezzins' calls to prayer rumble through
Cairo likes claps of thunder. But inside the synagogue on Adly
Street, behind a wrought iron fence and heavy wooden doors, an old
woman named Iman hardly seems to hear them as she dusts mahogany
benches and polishes the granite entryway.</LD>
<LD>   She works hurriedly even though she knows no one will be coming to
pray today. People rarely do. The calendar is open: no bar mitzvahs,
no Sunday weddings with couples ascending the marble stairs amid
garlands of roses and gardenias.</LD>
<LD>   "It's only funerals now," she said, sighing. Still, as the
volunteer caretaker, she wants everything spotless because
responsibility comes with being one of Egypt's last Jews.</LD>
<TE>   Today fewer than 200 Egyptian Jews remain, and only a dozen or so
-- all elderly women -- are actively trying to save the nation's
Jewish history. Soon the community, which once numbered 150,000 here
in the capital alone and dates to the last years of the pharaohs,
will fade away.</TE>
<TE>   In a final twist, that end approaches with the community under
siege -- not by Arab nationalists or Islamic radicals, but by Jews
abroad who fled Egypt decades ago and want the community's artifacts
to follow them.</TE>
<TE>   Shaar Hashamayim synagogue, built in the early 1900s, was once the
very heart of the Arab world's largest Jewish community. The Jews of
Cairo freely published their own newspapers in French and Arabic.
They prayed in 29 synagogues, owned most of the major department
stores, cornered the cotton trade and created urban districts, worked
as financiers and merchants and helped found the National Bank of
Egypt. Several served as elected members of parliament. Many streets
and squares were named after prominent Jews.</TE>
<TE>   But each of four wars with Israel -- in 1948, 1956, 1967, 1973 --
resulted in a tide of emigration. Synagogues closed, rabbis left,
kosher butcher shops closed. Over nearly six decades, the number of
Jews in the Arab world dwindled to less than 40,000 from 850,000.
Those who remained became an Arabic-speaking, easily forgotten
minority in a sea of Muslims. Today most are elderly, unskilled, poor
and apolitical. Few practice Judaism. "I know little of religion,"
Iman said.</TE>
<TE>   Given the diminished size of the Jewish community here, the
Historical Society of Jews From Egypt in Brooklyn, N.Y., wants
historical and religious items sent to the U.S. for safekeeping.</TE>
<TE>   The society's members fear that the artifacts might be sold to
private collectors. It makes no sense to keep them in Egypt, they
say, because nine of the 12 remaining synagogues are closed and the
other three are rarely used. The community is so small, it can't even
gather the 10 men required for a minyan, or prayer group.</TE>
<TE>   "These records and artifacts belong to us," the society's
president, Desire Sakkal, wrote the U.S. Congress in August in a bid
for assistance. "They are our heritage and our history, and we want
them available for use, consultation and research at a location
closer to where most of us Jews from Egypt live today."</TE>
<TE>   Carmen Weinstein, president of the Jewish Community Council of
Egypt, and her ailing mother, Esther, have ignored for the last five
years what they refer to as the society's "insensitive letters
referring to our inevitable extinction" and refused to meet a
delegation, headed by a rabbi, sent to Egypt by the society. At the
council's request, the Egyptian government in 1997 classified the
artifacts as antiquities, meaning they cannot be sold or exported.</TE>
<TE>   "We are still in Cairo despite what everybody says," said
Weinstein, who runs a stationery store near Shaar Hashamayim. "Taking
the Jewish seforim [prayer books], books and records out of Egypt is
tantamount to saying that Egypt should demolish the pyramids and the
Temple of Luxor because there are no pharaohs left."</TE>
<TE>   Although age and limited resources are slowing their efforts, the
Weinsteins and others have worked hard to keep the Jewish community
in Cairo viable. With the cooperation of the government, they saved a
Jewish cemetery in nearby Basatin from being destroyed by a new road
and oversaw the renovation of the synagogue on Adly Street in 1980 --
a dividend of then-President Anwar Sadat's peace treaty with Israel.</TE>
<TE>   Another surviving Cairo synagogue -- Ben Ezra, said to be one of
the world's oldest Jewish temples -- was renovated with money from
the Egyptian Jewish community in Canada.</TE>
<TE>   "Memories of weddings and bar mitzvahs flooded my mind as we
walked through this magnificent structure where my grandparents,
parents and lots of my many uncles and aunts were married," Leon
Wahba of Cleveland wrote Carmen Weinstein last year after seeing
Shaar Hashamayim on his first visit to Egypt since he left in the
1950s. "The synagogue is very well protected by the Egyptian police,
and we found it to be in particularly good shape."</TE>
<TE>   A dozen police stand guard across the street from Shaar
Hashamayim, and surviving members of the Jewish community say they
are not subjected to discrimination or hostility. But given the
tensions in the region, they find it preferable to live quietly
without calling attention to their religion.</TE>
<TE>   "These are disheartening times for everyone in the Middle East,"
Weinstein said.</TE>
<TE>   Most Egyptian Jews have visited Israel, and many feel contempt for
those who left Egypt. To those who stayed, this is still the
motherland.</TE>
<TE>   When Jewish Egyptian singer Laila Mourad died in 1995, an Israeli
diplomat called her family and offered to allow her to be buried in
the Jewish state.</TE>
<TE>   Her son fired off angry letters to Egyptian newspapers, saying his
mother had nothing to do with Israel -- she was Egyptian.</TE>

<HD>Mexico to Boost Farm Subsidies</HD>
<DH>Move is a bid to remain competitive with U.S. when tariffs
are lifted because of NAFTA.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>MEXICO CITY</DL>
<LD>The Mexican government said Monday that it would reintroduce crop
support prices and increase other subsidies in a bid to quell fears
that the nation's farm sector will be demolished by U.S. competition
when most remaining agricultural tariffs are lifted in January as
prescribed by the North American Free Trade Agreement.</LD>
<LD>   President Vicente Fox said he would press developed nations to
reduce their own farm subsidies while providing more distribution,
technical and financial aid to Mexican farmers.</LD>
<LD>   "My administration is protecting our farmers, helping them become
more efficient, and ensuring that they have equal conditions ... as
those of our major competitors," Fox said.</LD>
<TE>   The key to the $10-billion program is the reintroduction of
per-ton price supports for some basic grains.</TE>
<TE>   Mexican farmers complain that they cannot compete with the U.S.
government's much larger farm subsidy budget.</TE>
<TE>   However, Mexico's subsidies are already higher on a per-ton basis
than those in the U.S.</TE>

<HD>Pakistani Court Orders Islamic Militant Released</HD>
<DH>The leader of the group blamed for an attack on India's
Parliament hasn't been charged.</DH>

<DL>LAHORE, Pakistan</DL>
<LD>A Pakistani court Monday ordered the release of a prominent Islamic
militant who led a group that is blamed for an attack on India's
Parliament and has been declared a terrorist organization by
Washington.</LD>
<LD>   The court said the government's detention of Hafiz Mohammed Saeed
was unlawful. Saeed, leader of Lashkar-e-Taiba until it was banned by
the government last year, was placed under house arrest Oct. 31 after
being held without charge for months.</LD>
<LD>   Lashkar-e-Taiba, one of the main groups fighting Indian rule in
the disputed territory of Kashmir, was banned by Pakistan after the
United States declared it a terrorist organization last year.</LD>
<TE>   New Delhi blamed the group for an attack on its Parliament in
December, an incident that helped sharply escalate tension between
nuclear-armed neighbors India and Pakistan.</TE>
<TE>   Saeed now heads the newly formed hard-line Islamic group Jamaat ud
Daawa, which early this month denounced the U.S.-declared war on
terror and called on Muslims to wage jihad, or holy war.</TE>
<TE>   High Court Judge Chaudhry Ejaz Ahmad ruled that Saeed's house
arrest was illegal because he had not been charged with any crime.
Saeed should be "released forthwith if not required in any case," the
judge said.</TE>
<TE>   There was no immediate comment from the government as to whether
he would be released or kept under detention on some other basis.</TE>
<TE>   The order for Saeed's release came a day after a controversial law
that allows security authorities to detain terror suspects for a year
without charges took effect. The law was not in force when Saeed was
detained.</TE>
<TE>   Saeed's family said he had been detained by Pakistan's
intelligence services since May 15. This had never been acknowledged
by the government.</TE>
<TE>   Islamic militant groups in Pakistan strongly oppose President
Pervez Musharraf's support for a U.S.-declared war on terror and are
suspected of being behind a wave of attacks on Christians and
foreigners in the country.</TE>
<TE>   Riding a wave of anti-U.S. sentiment, a coalition of six Islamic
parties made an unexpectedly strong showing in general elections Oct.
10.</TE>

<HD>New Size, Scope, Mission in Store for NATO</HD>
<DH>At a summit this week in Prague, the alliance will announce
a shift in focus to terrorism and arms control, and issue membership
invitations.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>David Holley</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>PRAGUE, Czech Republic</DL>
<LD>NATO leaders will declare at a summit here this week a new focus on
the global fight against terrorism and the proliferation of weapons
of mass destruction, edging the Western alliance further away from
its roots as an anti-Soviet defense group.</LD>
<LD>   The shift grows out of the global response to the Sept. 11
terrorist attacks and a warming of the West's relations with Moscow,
as the former enemies seek to cooperate against a shared threat.</LD>
<LD>   Additionally -- and of particular importance for those who still
fear Russia or believe it may emerge as a danger in the future --
making anti-terrorism a core mission conveniently gives the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization an official new reason to exist. That
makes it easier to keep the alliance in place to ensure military
cooperation among members without needing to provoke Moscow by
declaring it still a potential enemy.</LD>
<TE>   Leaders who will gather here in the Czech capital Thursday and
Friday also will debate what role members should play in any U.S.-led
war against Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   The emphasis on anti-terrorism efforts should take some of the
sting for Russia out of plans to issue membership invitations at the
summit to as many as seven formerly communist states, including three
Baltic countries that for decades were part of the Soviet Union.</TE>
<TE>   Membership for former Soviet bloc states has become "a symbol that
the given country belongs to democratic Europe," so NATO enlargement
helps "expand the frontiers of European values," said Lubos
Dobrovsky, a Czech dissident who after the fall of communism became
defense minister and ambassador to Russia.</TE>
<TE>   Moscow is happy to be a partner in anti-terrorism efforts but
quietly seethes over the alliance's planned expansion. Its response
has been muted for a variety of reasons, ranging from acceptance of
the inevitable to calculations that Russia's long-term interests lie
after all in closer integration with the West.</TE>
<TE>   "We hope ... that none of the steps to be taken will undermine
stability and security in the common European space and will not
damage or prejudice the national security interests of Russia,"
Russian President Vladimir V. Putin said last week in Brussels after
meeting with NATO Secretary-General George Robertson to discuss the
summit. "I hope mutual military restraint and confidence will serve
as a basis for NATO-Russia relations."</TE>
<TE>   Robertson, standing alongside Putin, said steps taken in the Czech
capital would not be "in any way contrary to any of Russia's security
interests."</TE>
<TE>   Putin and Robertson said they were satisfied with the work of the
NATO-Russia Council, a body set up in May that brings Moscow into
full consultation with the allies on issues such as peacekeeping and
terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   Critics fear that NATO and Russia are trying to paper over their
differences. The council "created the false illusion that Russia can
be regarded as a credible partner of the democratic world," Dobrovsky
said. But Moscow, he insisted, "retains many of the old Soviet
characteristics" even as Putin seeks "modernization at any price."</TE>
<TE>   Speaking Friday in Istanbul, Turkey, Robertson declared that
"Prague is about NATO's comprehensive transformation."</TE>
<TE>   "After Sept. 11, we had to realize that terrorism has become an
international security challenge and that we had no real recipe to
deal with it," he said. "That was not the only shock we were dealt.
The fact that Al Qaeda operated from Afghanistan demonstrated the
connection between terrorism and failed states. The fact that some of
these terrorists were trying to acquire weapons of mass destruction
raised yet another danger: the specter of nuclear, biological or
chemical weapons in the hands of people too irrational to be deterred
by the logic of orthodox deterrence."</TE>
<TE>   The result was to turn "combating terrorism into a new mission for
this alliance," Robertson said, and to end NATO's unwillingness to
act "out of area" -- outside the borders of its member states.</TE>
<TE>   "The idea of imposing geographical limitations on NATO's reach is,
in effect, dead," he declared. "When the World Trade Center
collapsed, the notion of in and out of area collapsed with it. We can
no longer look at threats only geographically."</TE>
<TE>   In the context of the alliance gearing up for a long and fierce
anti-terrorism struggle, fear of Russia has become the elephant in
the closet, unlikely to be discussed frankly at the summit.</TE>
<TE>   The alliance will portray enlargement primarily as a way of
welcoming new members into the community of Western democracies,
rather than defending them against Moscow.</TE>
<TE>   Even so, letting in Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia inevitably
carries overtones of protecting them from their powerful neighbor to
the east. Many in those states fear a reimposition of Moscow's
control, and some Russian nationalists would like just that.</TE>
<TE>   Planned invitations to Romania and Bulgaria are widely seen as
extending NATO's reach and improving its defense against terrorist or
other threats arising in the Middle East and Central Asia. Welcoming
Slovenia and Slovakia is little more than filling in territorial gaps
of membership in Central Europe.</TE>
<TE>   Accession for the invitees is likely to be targeted for 2004.
Three other applicants -- Albania, Macedonia and Croatia -- are not
expected to win invitations at this gathering.</TE>
<TE>   NATO intends to respond to the new terrorist threats by shifting
its focus toward more flexible and high-tech forces, Robertson said
in a speech this month in Brussels.</TE>
<TE>   Alliance members will promise to build strength in areas such as
"long-range airlift, air tankers, better surveillance,
precision-guided weapons to prevail with the minimum casualties on
all sides, modern secure communications ... and protection against
weapons of mass destruction," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The summit will also approve a U.S. proposal to create a NATO
rapid-response force capable of quick deployment outside alliance
territory, he said.</TE>
<TE>   About 12,000 police and soldiers are expected to be on duty at the
summit to protect more than 40 heads of state or government. Up to
250 American troops and 15 U.S. aircraft, including four to six
fighters in the air at any time, will assist.</TE>
<TE>   President Bush will attend, as will many leaders from the 18 other
NATO member states, the 10 countries seeking membership and other
nations formally associated with the alliance.</TE>
<TE>   Bush embarks on his 11th trip abroad as president with his
domestic clout at its zenith and his nation in a showdown with Iraq.
Midterm elections Nov. 5 left the Democrats in disarray and will
deliver early next year a Republican-dominated Congress ready to do
his bidding. Armed with a U.N. Security Council resolution against
Iraq, the president could not be riding higher as he takes his
campaign against Iraqi President Saddam Hussein to a new level.</TE>
<TE>   Robertson told reporters last week in Brussels that the summit
will debate what members should do if Iraq rebuffs U.N. weapons
inspections, which would set the stage for a U.S.-led war to
overthrow Hussein. "NATO nations may well assist the United States
... at the end of the day," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Decisions made here could set precedents and define better command
structures for future such actions far from NATO territory, which are
likely to be carried out by so-called coalitions of the willing
rather than the alliance as a whole.</TE>
<TE>   Instead of viewing NATO as a unified military alliance, the Bush
administration increasingly sees it as a "toolbox" that can provide
niche capabilities, such as Czech expertise in defense against
chemical and biological weapons, said Philip H. Gordon, who was
director for European affairs at the National Security Council in the
Clinton White House.</TE>
<TE>   Putin will not attend the summit, but he is scheduled to meet with
Bush in St. Petersburg afterward. Bush's trip, which will also take
him to Lithuania and Romania, amounts in many ways to a postelection
"victory lap," Gordon said.</TE>
<TE>   Alexei G. Arbatov, deputy chairman of the defense committee in the
lower house of Russia's parliament, said in an interview that Moscow
hasn't spoken out more forcefully against enlargement "because the
more Russia speaks against it, the more certain NATO expansion will
be. Experience already shows this."</TE>
<TE>   Cooperating with the U.S. and integrating into Europe is essential
if Russia is to be "a civilized 21st century power," Arbatov said.</TE>
<TE>   But one of the key reasons Putin decided to go along with many
Western policies after the Sept. 11 attacks was to head off criticism
abroad of his authoritarian measures at home, Arbatov added. These
include tighter controls on the mass media, a tough military policy
toward separatists in the republic of Chechnya and the promotion of
many people from the armed forces and secret services to positions of
influence.</TE>
<TE>   "I would prefer for President Putin to do just the opposite, to go
forward with improvement and expansion of democratic freedoms,
division of powers, rule of law in our country and finding a
political solution to the war in Chechnya, while being much more
tough on the issues of international security where the West, in
particular the United States, has very unfair or counterproductive or
just very negative positions," Arbatov said, citing as examples NATO
expansion and the U.S. withdrawal in June from the 1972 Antiballistic
Missile Treaty.</TE>

<HD>U.N. to Boost Food Aid to Palestinians</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>GENEVA</DL>
<LD>The head of a U.N. agency aiding Palestinians said Monday that his
organization is preparing a massive food program to combat growing
malnutrition among residents of the West Bank and Gaza Strip.</LD>
<LD>   The United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees
in the Near East estimates that in 2003, it will need to deliver
daily food parcels to 222,000 families, or about 1.3 million people,
more than one-third of the Palestinian population.</LD>
<LD>   Before the Palestinian uprising against Israeli occupation in the
West Bank and Gaza began in September 2000, the U.N. agency was
feeding about 11,000 families a day.</LD>
<TE>   "Recent reports show that about 22% of Palestinian children are
suffering from acute or chronic malnutrition," agency
Commissioner-General Peter Hansen told reporters in Switzerland. "The
economy is close to collapse. The level of malnutrition compares with
Zimbabwe or Congo."</TE>
<TE>   The agency will ask donors for $200 million in 2003 as part of a
U.N. global appeal on behalf of all its agencies. The figure compares
with $170 million for 2002, when donors met only 60% of the agency's
appeal.</TE>
<TE>   The United Nations said in September that nearly half of
Palestinians were living on less than its poverty threshold of $2 a
day.</TE>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>SYDNEY, Australia</DL>
<LD>Police have arrested a man suspected of planning to bomb Israeli
diplomatic posts in Australia, the suspect's attorney said today.</LD>
<LD>   The man was identified by his attorney as Jack Roche, 49, a
convert to Islam who claims he trained with the Al Qaeda terrorist
network.</LD>
<LD>   Roche told an Australian newspaper he learned to use explosives in
Afghanistan two years ago. The arrest followed nationwide raids by
police after an Oct. 12 bombing that killed 191 people, mostly
Australians, on the Indonesian island of Bali. Police said the
alleged bomb plot is not linked to that attack.</LD>
<TE>   The raids targeted suspected sympathizers of Jemaah Islamiah, an
Islamic group suspected of ties to the Bali blast.</TE>
<TE>   Roche, one of many members of Perth's Muslim community who spoke
to media after the raids, had said he met the group's alleged
spiritual leader, Abu Bakar Bashir, in the 1990s when Bashir visited
Australia.</TE>

<HD>Scavengers Are Gauge of Rising Poverty</HD>
<DH>Reflecting a regionwide problem, so many people are
gathering scraps in Argentina's capital that they now have their own
train.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Hector Tobar</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>JOSE LEON SUAREZ, Argentina</DL>
<LD>Most people avert their eyes when the Ghost Train rattles past.
Probably they wish they hadn't seen it. Or maybe they want to believe
it doesn't exist. After all, it has no official timetable, no
windowpanes, no doors in the frames and no seats.</LD>
<LD>   But the train is undeniably there. Its passengers are trash
scavengers who travel every day from this down-on-its-luck
northwestern suburb to a city still known, occasionally, as "the
Paris of Latin America." These "cardboard people" of Buenos Aires are
perhaps the most potent symbol of the sudden increase in poverty
across the region, a trend documented this month by a U.N. report.</LD>
<LD>   In 2001, 214 million people, or about 43% of Latin Americans, were
living in poverty, according to the study by the Economic Commission
for Latin America and the Caribbean. The study estimates that by the
end of this year, there will be 15 million more Latin Americans
living in poverty than in 2000.</LD>
<TE>   Roughly one-fourth of the new poor are Argentines, with increases
too in those countries that have traditionally sent migrants to work
in Argentina, including Bolivia, Brazil, Peru, Paraguay and Uruguay.</TE>
<TE>   "Argentina weighs heavy in the total increase we've seen in
poverty in the region these last few years," said Jose Antonio
Ocampo, executive secretary of the commission. "We expect the largest
increase in the following year to also be in Argentina."</TE>
<TE>   In Buenos Aires, the cardboard people began appearing in large
numbers during the two-year period covered by the report and have
become a fixture of life. Their numbers have tripled in the last year
and, by some estimates, have reached 50,000.</TE>
<TE>   The city has given commuting cartoneros, as they are known in
Spanish, a train of their own so they don't bother "respectable"
passengers with their carts of scrap paper, cardboard, cans and
salvaged food. Since late 2000, the Ghost Train has left every
afternoon from the ramshackle station at Jose Leon Suarez with 300
men and women who make a living harvesting scraps from trash bins.</TE>
<TE>   "This is our job now. This is how we survive," said Lidia
Quinteros, a former shoe factory worker who has become a leader of
the trash collectors on the Ghost Train. "The company laid everyone
off. They put us on the street." Now the street provides her family a
living of sorts.</TE>
<TE>   "A quarter of them are traditional scavengers," Vicente Muleiro, a
poet and journalist, wrote in October. "The rest are ex-waiters,
ex-factory workers, ex-maids, ex-something from the 1990s, who step
into the 21st century with scavengers' shoes, worn-out Reeboks."</TE>
<TE>   Official unemployment in Argentina is 18%. But the country is only
the most extreme case marking the end of a chapter in recent Latin
American history.</TE>
<TE>   For much of the 1990s, governments from Brazil to Mexico embraced
neoliberal economics, opening their countries to outside investment
and free trade. Those reforms helped feed a boom in the Latin
American economy. By 1997, the poverty rate in the region had dropped
almost 5 percentage points compared with 1990, according to the
commission's study.</TE>
<TE>   Now that boom has lost its steam.</TE>
<TE>   "Since then the region has seen economic growth and the fight
against poverty stagnate and, in some cases, clearly retreat," Ocampo
wrote in his report. "It is no exaggeration ... to say that the
population of Latin America has been affected by the negative
consequences of this lost half-decade."</TE>
<TE>   The report forecasts an economic contraction of 0.8% in the region
this year. Some countries have managed to hold on to the gains of the
1990s, however. In Mexico and the Dominican Republic, poverty rates
have dropped slightly in recent years.</TE>
<TE>   But a slowing economy in most nations, and a deepening recession
in others, mean that "it will be virtually impossible" for many Latin
American countries to halve extreme poverty by 2015, the goal set in
the September 2000 United Nations Millennium Declaration.</TE>
<TE>   In Bolivia, one of Latin America's poorest nations, poverty crept
up in 2001, reaching 61%. Recent years have seen thousands of
impoverished migrants abandon the countryside for areas such as the
La Paz suburb of El Alto, one of Bolivia's fastest-growing cities.</TE>
<TE>   "It's difficult for a country like Bolivia to get out of poverty,
but it is easy to fall back in," said Gonzalo Chavez, a La Paz
economist. "The gains made over a decade of growth have been lost in
the last three years."</TE>
<TE>   The share of people living in extreme poverty, or indigence, in
Bolivia remains higher -- 37.3% -- than the overall poverty rate in
Argentina of 30.3%, according to the U.N. study.</TE>
<TE>   "In Bolivia, there is no safety net when the economy goes into
crisis," Chavez said. "Our poor are very vulnerable. Overnight, they
can lose their homes and end up sleeping on the street."</TE>
<TE>   Traditionally, many have fled to Argentina. Half a century ago,
Jose Leon Suarez was a mecca for the hundreds of thousands of Italian
immigrants arriving in Argentina in the wake of World War II. Now
impoverished Bolivians and Peruvians live among the struggling
Argentines.</TE>
<TE>   The train company added the Ghost Train -- also called the White
Train -- two years ago, in response to the growing number of scrap
collectors on its routes. The cartoneros pay a monthly fare of about
$5. Jorge Molina, a spokesman for the company, said the riders
practically dismantled the first Ghost Train.</TE>
<TE>   "It had aluminum parts, windows and locks, all of which were
valuable to the cartoneros," he said. "The train they have now is
adapted to their needs. It's stripped down."</TE>
<TE>   The old white cars clearly make up relics from another era, a bare
metal shell of a train that looks conspicuously out of place as it
chugs past middle-class Buenos Aires.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the cartoneros on the line have invested a bit of their
earnings in specialized carts. For about $35, welders attach car
wheels to a steel frame, creating a contraption that allows one
person to push up to 500 pounds of scrap down the street.</TE>
<TE>   "This train is something we fought for, so that we could work in
peace," said Norma Flores, a cartonera and mother of five who leads a
neighborhood committee of scavengers.</TE>
<TE>   At the end of the day, just before midnight, she rolls her cart up
the ramp to the station in the middle-class community of Belgrano.
After a week of trudging around the city, gathering paper and
cardboard mostly, she usually makes about $30.</TE>

<HD>Inspectors Arrive in Iraq</HD>
<DH>U.N. team leader seeks to calm fears of war. The first
checks could come as early as Nov. 27.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>CAIRO</DL>
<LD>United Nations weapons inspectors returned to Iraq on Monday for the
first time in nearly four years, backed by the threat of force and
the authority to search anywhere, any time, for chemical, biological
and nuclear weapons -- even in Saddam Hussein's lavish palaces.</LD>
<LD>   Chief weapons inspector Hans Blix and Mohammed Baradei, director
general of the International Atomic Energy Agency, immediately sought
to calm fears that their arrival in Baghdad brought the region closer
to war.</LD>
<LD>   "We have come here for one single reason, and that is the world
wants to have assurance that there are no weapons of mass destruction
in Iraq," Blix said shortly after landing at Saddam Hussein
International Airport.</LD>
<TE>   Credible inspections are "in the interests of Iraq and the
interests of the world," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The United States has threatened to attack Iraq if it does not
cooperate with the inspectors, who are operating under a tough new
U.N. Security Council resolution that gives Baghdad "a final
opportunity" to disarm and warns of serious consequences if it does
not.</TE>
<TE>   The first test of Iraq's intentions could come as early as Nov.
27, when, Blix said, preliminary checks are scheduled to begin.
Perhaps the more important date is Dec. 8, the deadline for Iraq to
file a list of any banned weapons programs. The second deadline
appears to signal a conflict waiting to happen, since Iraq insists it
has no such programs.</TE>
<TE>   Both the United States and Iraq have stoked the uncertainty
surrounding the inspections, each doing all it can to keep the other
guessing.</TE>
<TE>   Iraq's parliament, though relatively powerless, made a show of
voting against accepting the return of weapons inspectors the day
before Hussein's foreign minister notified U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan that Iraq would abide by the resolution.</TE>
<TE>   As Blix and his crew were preparing Monday for high-tech equipment
to be unloaded from their cargo jet, Iraqi ground forces and U.S.
fighter jets were firing at one another in the so-called no-fly zone
over the northern part of the country.</TE>
<TE>   The Bush administration has said that it will give inspections a
chance but that firing at U.S. warplanes patrolling the no-fly zones
in the north and south might well be considered a "material breach"
of the U.N. resolution -- and, if confirmed by the Security Council,
could trigger an attack.</TE>
<TE>   White House officials said Monday that U.S. warplanes would
continue to fire back when targeted by the Iraqis but that the Bush
administration was not ready to take the matter to the Security
Council.</TE>
<TE>   "I would emphasize that this goes to showing [Hussein's] intention
to comply and cooperate," White House spokesman Scott McClellan said.
"But in the meantime, our aircraft will respond when fired upon.</TE>
<TE>   "Our view is zero tolerance, that Saddam Hussein does not need to
be playing games at this point. No cat and mouse. It is time for him
to comply and cooperate and disarm," McClellan said.</TE>
<TE>   The White House might encounter tough going if it decides to ask
the Security Council to consider the firing at the warplanes a
"material breach." When the council voted unanimously this month to
back Resolution 1441, many of the members made it clear they would
not accept a rush to war.</TE>
<TE>   Russian Ambassador Sergei V. Lavrov received assurances from
British diplomats that firing in the no-fly zones would not be
considered a trigger for an attack. British officials held to that
view Monday.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't consider 1441 to be about the enforcement of the no-fly
zones," a British diplomat said. "A potshot in the no-fly zone is a
black mark, but in our view of 1441, it is not a material breach."</TE>
<TE>   Diplomats said the tough talk from the White House, while
distressing to the United States' Security Council allies, might be a
way of keeping pressure on Baghdad while inspections begin. But
retaliatory attacks on Iraqi military installations might also help
U.S. and British forces destroy Baghdad's defense capabilities before
an all-out war.</TE>
<TE>   In recent days, Baghdad has sought to make it clear that although
it agreed to the return of weapons inspectors, it did not do so
meekly.</TE>
<TE>   In an interview on British television, Deputy Prime Minister Tarik
Aziz suggested that if Iraq was hit, U.S. and British allies in the
Middle East would be targeted.</TE>
<TE>   "We are an old nation, and we could survive," he said. "But I tell
you, if the U.S. and U.K. wage a war against Iraq, the consequences
will be very bad to them and their friends in the region."</TE>
<TE>   The Iraqi newspaper Babel, which is owned by Hussein's eldest son,
Uday, said in an editorial Monday that "our country is free of
weapons of mass destruction.... Those unjust Americans, as well as
others, should leave the Security Council alone and end the unjust
siege imposed on us."</TE>
<TE>   The Iraqi newspaper Al Thawra, the mouthpiece of the president's
ruling Baath Socialist Party, said in a front-page editorial that the
previous U.N. inspection team was "an American organization to spy on
Iraq." It added that it hoped the new teams do not include spies for
the United States.</TE>
<TE>   "The authority given to the inspectors is so high I just don't see
how they will function," said Wamidh Nadhmi, a political science
professor at Baghdad University. "Perhaps it is intended this way --
that any clash between the two sides might give the U.S.
administration a pretext for its war aims."</TE>
<TE>   And while Blix was trying to calm tensions in the region, he was
struggling against a widespread feeling that no matter what the
inspectors find, the U.S. is committed to going after Hussein.</TE>
<TE>   "From when the countdown began, Iraq was going to be affected,"
said Farid Khazen, a political science professor at American
University in Beirut. "At best, the regime will be besieged. At
worst, the regime will be removed."</TE>
<TE>   The last weapons inspectors were pulled out of Iraq nearly four
years ago. Baghdad charged that there were spies on the team, and the
United States complained that Iraq was using the accusation as an
excuse to obstruct the inspectors. After the team withdrew, the U.S.
and Britain waged a four-day bombing campaign.</TE>
<TE>   Baghdad never allowed the inspectors to return and embarked on a
diplomatic and economic campaign to get around the United Nations.</TE>
<TE>   Since it invaded Kuwait in 1990, Iraq has been saddled with severe
trade sanctions that can be removed only if inspectors verify that it
has destroyed any weapons of mass destruction along with the means to
create them.</TE>
<TE>   The sanctions started crumbling as countries such as Russia,
France and Turkey sought to gain a foothold in the oil-rich Iraqi
economy. But that came to a halt this year as the Bush administration
turned its focus to Hussein.</TE>
<TE>   Blix, a 74-year-old Swede, was called out of retirement to head
the inspection teams. He has tried to win the confidence of both
sides, saying that although he cannot guarantee that there won't be
spies on his staff, he would remove them if any were discovered. He
has also said he would take a hard line with Baghdad.</TE>
<TE>   "The question of war and peace remains first of all in the hands
of Iraq, the Security Council and the members of the Security
Council," Blix said Sunday in Cyprus, where he and Baradei joined
about two dozen other members of the advance team before heading out.</TE>
<TE>   Annan had an even more direct assessment of Baghdad's
responsibility. "I urge President Saddam Hussein to comply fully with
the council's demands, for the sake of his people, regional security
and world order," he said in a statement.</TE>

<HD>Mr. Hart's Teachable Moment</HD>
<DH>The former state education secretary stressed
accountability. Now back in front of the class, he finds that ideals
and reality often clash.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Duke Helfand</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>Gary K. Hart, teaching his ninth-graders about the Sept. 11 attacks,
launches into a discussion about state-sponsored terrorism.</LD>
<LD>   Confused looks dart across the classroom as one of Hart's
brightest history students raises her hand. I don't understand, she
says quietly. Are you talking about Nebraska and Wyoming?</LD>
<LD>   No, Hart gently explains, he's talking about countries suspected
of sponsoring terrorism.</LD>
<TE>   It is an eye-opening moment for a man who once virtually presided
over California's public schools -- first in the Legislature as
chairman of the Senate Education Committee and then as Gov. Gray
Davis' first education secretary.</TE>
<TE>   At 59, when Hart could cash in on his connections or coast toward
retirement, he has come home to the classroom, to the profession he
joined fresh out of Stanford and Harvard 35 years ago.</TE>
<TE>   In the last three months, he has discovered that it's one thing to
issue edicts about test scores and academic standards from the
Capitol and another thing entirely to motivate 37 fidgety teenagers.</TE>
<TE>   But that's the challenge. In Room 305 at Sacramento's Kennedy High
School, Hart is testing his ideas about education. Most important, he
wants to give average students a shot at tough honors classes and,
eventually, college.</TE>
<TE>   And he is testing himself, even if he has some perks that other
teachers envy.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not out trying to change the world. I'm just trying to do my
little thing," he says. "If you can influence a few dozen kids,
that's not small potatoes."</TE>
<TE>   Hundreds of thousands of other teachers might love to do their
"thing," too. But when he was secretary of education, Hart helped
oversee the system that governs how California teachers run their
classrooms and what textbooks they use. Now Hart has his own
students, and he is finding that he wants freedom to innovate.</TE>
<TE>   He has jettisoned the chronological approach to California and
U.S. history in favor of teaching a few choice topics in depth, such
as the Civil War and the Cold War. And he has handpicked his
students, not so much for their good grades but for the potential he
sees in them. "I want to march to my own drummer," he says.</TE>
<TE>   At the front of his class, Hart is no politician. He comes across
as a mild-mannered professor, with bushy gray eyebrows and slightly
wrinkled clothes that sometimes clash -- one recent day he wore green
pants with a brown belt, blue socks and black shoes.</TE>
<TE>   At nearly 6-foot-4, Hart towers over his students, craning his
neck downward when they approach to ask when their assignments are
due.</TE>
<TE>   This child of the '60s often starts class by playing music from
the Beach Boys, John Denver and others. But it is no idle indulgence.
He uses songs such as Denver's "Rocky Mountain High" to teach about
geography and to psych up his students to learn.</TE>
<TE>   One recent day, after collecting homework, Hart flipped on a CD:</TE>
<TE>   This land is your land, this land is my land</TE>
<TE>   From California to the New York island ... .</TE>
<TE>   Some of the students gave singer Trini Lopez a tepid reception.
One boy yawned. Two other students went right on talking to each
other. Several students paid attention, but no one seemed to notice
Hart as he sang quietly along, momentarily unaware of himself:</TE>
<TE>   From the redwood forest, to the gulf stream waters</TE>
<TE>   This land was made for you and me.</TE>
<TE>   The song ended and Hart snapped back into teacher mode. He asked
one of his students to approach a map of the United States tacked to
the wall.</TE>
<TE>   "Can you find the New York island?" he asked.</TE>
<TE>   The girl eyed the map, then shrugged her shoulders.</TE>
<TE>   "The redwood forest? The gulf stream waters?"</TE>
<TE>   The girl stood silent for a moment until another student pointed
out the sites.</TE>
<TE>   Later, Hart felt guilty for embarrassing the girl. But the
interaction underscored his challenge. Several of his students could
not name the vice president of the United States when he asked
recently. During a discussion on weapons of mass destruction, one
student didn't know what a nuclear bomb was.</TE>
<TE>   "They're bright, they're energetic," Hart says, "but their
cultural and political knowledge is very limited."</TE>
<TE>   Hart, unlike other teachers, has the part-time help of two college
students who read first drafts of the ninth-graders' essays. Still,
he says he is working harder than ever, putting in 80 hours some
weeks writing lesson plans, chaperoning field trips, grading papers.
An insomniac, he wakes up at 4 a.m. many days and shows up at school
before other teachers to prepare his classes.</TE>
<TE>   He rides his students just as hard, assigning up to two hours of
homework each night. The readings include newspaper and magazine
articles about everything from women's literacy in Afghanistan to the
recent indictment of Sacramento Kings basketball star Chris Webber on
perjury charges.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to chapters in the history textbook, each student also
has to read at least three novels or nonfiction books over the
semester, such as "O Pioneers!," the story of an immigrant family's
struggle to save their Nebraska farm, or "Fast Food Nation," an
expose of how fast food has transformed America. Two months into the
school year, some of Hart's students are chafing at the pace.</TE>
<TE>   "Oh my God, we have so much homework. It's a lot of stress," said
Lauren Mirsky. "We always have something going on. It's my hardest
class by far."</TE>
<TE>   Some think he is stern and monotonous. "I personally don't like
the teacher," one girl said. "He's not funny at all."</TE>
<TE>   But to others, Hart's unconventional approach is working.</TE>
<TE>   "I know the homework is going to help me," said Robelle Cuison,
15. "I can't expect to get less in college."</TE>
<TE>   Many of Hart's students vaguely know he was someone important but
still aren't quite sure what to make of him. Hart doesn't talk much
about himself.</TE>
<TE>   "At first I thought he was that guy who ran for president with
that sex scandal, but my mom told me he wasn't," said Allie Powell,
15.</TE>
<TE>   She is referring to former Colorado Sen. Gary W. Hart, whose 1988
campaign for president was derailed by allegations of an extramarital
affair. (For the record, the two Harts share nothing more than a
name. The confusion has dogged the Californian for years.)</TE>
<TE>   Stanford, Then Harvard</TE>
<TE>   Gary K. Hart was a star football player at Santa Barbara High
School, where he was student body president in his senior year in
1960-61. On a football scholarship to Stanford, he studied history
and worked a semester as a congressional intern in Washington, D.C.</TE>
<TE>   After Stanford, Hart earned his master's degree in teaching from
Harvard. He briefly taught humanities at a black college in
Mississippi and also taught history and geography for a year at his
Santa Barbara alma mater. Hart, an anti-Vietnam War activist, was
equally passionate about politics. In 1970 he ran for Congress,
unsuccessfully. Two years later, he lost a bid for the state
Assembly. Then in 1974, he won that Assembly seat, representing most
of Santa Barbara County.</TE>
<TE>   Hart served eight years in the Assembly and 12 years in the state
Senate, where he was chairman of the Education Committee the entire
time. He wrote laws that established charter schools in California,
stiffened high school graduation requirements and introduced a new
skills test for teacher candidates.</TE>
<TE>   Hart retired from politics in 1994, saying he needed a change. He
founded and ran the Institute for Education Reform, a policy
organization at Cal State Sacramento, for about three years.</TE>
<TE>   Davis then appointed Hart state secretary of education. In that
job in 1999 and 2000, Hart formulated an education agenda for the
governor that included a new school accountability system and a high
school exit exam.</TE>
<TE>   But Hart yearned for the classroom. And with a state pension, a
wife who is a pediatrician, and their three daughters grown, money
was not a problem. He earns $28,000 a year for the four-fifths time
teaching position.</TE>
<TE>   "I missed talking about history," says Hart, who had returned to
teaching for short stints over the years, including a semester at
Kennedy High a decade ago.</TE>
<TE>   "I just don't think you can pontificate about education reform
without rolling up your sleeves and trying it."</TE>
<TE>   So he created the Program of America and California Explorations,
with the idea of preparing Kennedy High ninth- and 10th-graders --
many with subpar grades and test scores -- for Advanced Placement
history and English classes.</TE>
<TE>   Hart's students would attend a month of summer school to get a
jump on ninth grade. They would perform 30 hours of community service
during the school year -- tutoring children, cleaning parks, working
in food pantries. They would take field trips to historic sites and
college campuses -- visiting the Capitol, Yosemite, UC Berkeley,
Stanford.</TE>
<TE>   His classes would run not one hour, but two -- an eternity for
high school students. And he would team up with an English teacher,
taking half of the students in the fall and then trading in the
spring.</TE>
<TE>   Hart's non-chronological exploration of history and current events
is different from California's lock-step standards, which specify
what students are supposed to learn each year. Those, he believes,
are needed, but have become too confining.</TE>
<TE>   Enforced Standards</TE>
<TE>   Although Hart's work in government did not create those standards,
his and Davis' emphasis on accountability helped to enforce them.
Now, ironically, he works in an educational atmosphere that is more
regulated than he would like.</TE>
<TE>   "I think teachers are entitled to have some autonomy," he says. "A
thoughtful teacher can be straight-jacketed in ways that aren't
good."</TE>
<TE>   Hart's unusual proposal last year to create his history class won
immediate support from Sacramento schools Supt. Jim Sweeney.</TE>
<TE>   "What an opportunity to have a guy like Gary with his experience
and his passion," Sweeney said. "He doesn't act like an ex-state
senator. He just acts like a guy who is teaching kids."</TE>
<TE>   But Hart isn't an ordinary teacher. Besides the assistants for
reading essays, he has access to top district officials that
colleagues can only dream of. If he has to cut through bureaucracy,
Hart simply calls Sweeney's chief of staff. The district hammered out
a deal with the teachers union to allow Hart his position without
seniority.</TE>
<TE>   "It bothered some teachers," said Manuel Villarreal, executive
director of the Sacramento City Teachers Assn. "I had a couple call
me and say they would have liked to teach [the class]."</TE>
<TE>   Some Kennedy colleagues grumble privately about Hart getting
special treatment, and a few suspect that he has creamed the best and
brightest students for his program.</TE>
<TE>   Hart says it's not true, that he interviewed 300 eighth-graders
last year to recruit a balance of academic high-fliers, average
students and even some who perform below grade level.</TE>
<TE>   "I was looking for attitude," he says. "Kids who had potential and
a good work ethic."</TE>
<TE>   'This Is Your Shot'</TE>
<TE>   He was looking for students such as 14-year-old Zachary Carter,
whose final report card in eighth grade had more Cs than A's, but who
works hard to meet Hart's demanding expectations.</TE>
<TE>   "Being in this program has made me think about the future," said
Zachary, who talks about attending college in Florida on a golf
scholarship even if he isn't sure about a career.</TE>
<TE>   "This is way different from my other classes," he says. "It pushes
me harder so I can get better grades."</TE>
<TE>   Zachary's father, Bill Carter, sees a rare opportunity that his
son might otherwise only get in a private school that the family
can't afford.</TE>
<TE>   "I've said to Zachary, 'This is your shot. You're planting seeds
now for a real big harvest later on,' " the father said.</TE>
<TE>   Seeing his son hit the books has prompted Carter, a driver for
United Parcel Service, to consider returning to college at night to
finish his bachelor's degree. And for that, he thanks Hart. "I can't
say enough good things about the man," Carter said.</TE>
<TE>   Many Kennedy High teachers share that sentiment.</TE>
<TE>   "We're lucky to have a person of this caliber," English teacher
Sandy Callaghan said. "He has this tremendous intellectual background
and yet he's very approachable."</TE>
<TE>   Hart has pledged to stay at Kennedy High for two years, and he
envisions his program growing. Still, he's not sure what his future
holds.</TE>
<TE>   Right now, he's trying to keep up with his own demanding pace. The
school year is only 3 months old and his eyes are dark with fatigue
from long hours. But he wouldn't have it any other way.</TE>

<HD>Young Barristers Breaking Barriers</HD>
<DH>The jury is still out, but a mock trial team is making its
case for being among the elite.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Daniel Hernandez and Geoffrey Mohan</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Their first oral arguments were with the suit seller in the alley
shop in downtown Los Angeles.</LD>
<LD>   They had $200 and they needed two suits for a court appearance.</LD>
<LD>   By the time these dozen or so Manual Arts High School students
were done, they had talked their way into jackets, pants, shirts,
vests and ties.</LD>
<TE>   By the time they left Los Angeles County Superior Court last
Tuesday, the teenagers had persuaded a jury that Beck Martin hadn't
killed anybody.</TE>
<TE>   Now these budding barristers, with more moxie than money, are a
few arguments away from being declared the best high school lawyers
in Los Angeles County. They are the surprise survivors of the first
two rounds in Los Angeles County's 25th annual Mock Trial
Competition, knocking off teams from neighborhoods where real lawyers
and judges live.</TE>
<TE>   Manual Arts has a team name, the Toilers, that suggests the
destiny of the student body lies with the members' hands rather than
their heads. But the school's mock trial team has stood such
expectations on end, showing off members' public speaking skills and
familiarity with the law.</TE>
<TE>   A few years ago, the school didn't even send a squad to the
tournament, in which high school students play witnesses, experts and
litigators and argue a fake case before actual judges, as well as
juries consisting of Los Angeles attorneys.</TE>
<TE>   "I guess we have the hunger, you know, to play into those
stereotypes that we can't compete as far as intellectual things go,"
said Jason Zepeda, 17, the team's star of closing arguments, whose
eloquence nearly brought his "client" to genuine tears. He said the
team has surprised opponents with sharp motions and dramatic
arguments.</TE>
<TE>   If Manual High successfully prosecutes the fictional Martin
(played by sophomore team member Ricardo Elorza, 15) tonight, the
team will be in the quarterfinals.</TE>
<TE>   If the teenagers make their case twice more, they will represent
Los Angeles County in the state competition.</TE>
<TE>   "We are dedicated," Zepeda added. "We do have heart. There's no
reason why we shouldn't advance pretty far."</TE>
<TE>   Few can remember the last time a team from Manual Arts got to the
"super 16," down from the 68 schools that began the competition. If
the Toiler team could bill the time members stole from part-time jobs
and home chores to prepare for the competition -- 20 hours a week
since September -- they would be riding in limousines to the downtown
courthouse.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, they arrive in a school bus with taped-up seats, while
some of their suburban adversaries step to the curb from
air-conditioned coaches equipped with DVD players. The Toilers, who
attend the school across from the Coliseum, purposely swagger into
the courtroom like street toughs, carrying their work in manila
folders, while competitors clutch monogrammed case books and laptops.</TE>
<TE>   "We're not rich around here. A lot of the students couldn't buy
the latest fashions," Zepeda said. "Some of them snickered and
laughed and asked, 'Oh, what's Manual doing here?' But we actually
felt confident going in. Once you're up there, you just let it flow."</TE>
<TE>   Emily Polanco, the team's expert in pretrial motions, had her
doubts. "We didn't think we were going to make it," the 16-year-old
junior said. "Normally the stereotypes say that kids from here don't
do very well in anything, but this is showing that we can do well."</TE>
<TE>   In her own way, Polanco represents the team's cool ambition. She
wears a Yale sweater to school and said she will be applying there,
as well as to Harvard and Princeton. Just as matter-of-factly, she
said her mother is a security guard and her father is a trucker.</TE>
<TE>   Team members are mostly sons and daughters of immigrants -- 14
Latinos, one Vietnamese and one biracial Pacific Islander. Nearly all
live in South Los Angeles and most expect to be the first in their
families to attend college.</TE>
<TE>   They don't care whether their opponents tonight turn out to be
perennial front-runner Louisville, the all-girls Catholic school on
Mulholland Drive or the powerhouse William S. Hart High School team
from Newhall. "They're all the same," said Tuan Uong, 17, a Manual
Arts senior. "We just have to go in there and do the best we can."</TE>
<TE>   Toiler team members are coached by English and journalism teacher
Alan Seigal. For extra help, attorneys from the downtown firm
Skaddin, Arps, Slate, Meagher &amp; Flom visit the campus to help the
team deal with written motions, difficult witnesses and legal
surprises.</TE>
<TE>   And, of course, there is the look. Trials are "all about
presentation, attire," Uong said. "As much as they say it doesn't
matter, it does."</TE>
<TE>   Teams are graded on a point system by participating lawyers and
judges on pretrial motions, team performance, opening and closing
statements and cross-examination.</TE>
<TE>   Despite their bravado, the Toilers were bracing for failure last
week. When Seigal announced their second round victory over Damien
High School, a private boys school from La Verne, there was a stunned
silence.</TE>
<TE>   "When we heard we moved on, it didn't hit me," Uong said.</TE>
<TE>   At their practice session Monday afternoon, the Toilers reviewed
their case, coached witnesses and went over the rules of evidence and
case law crammed into a well-thumbed gray paper pamphlet provided by
the Constitutional Rights Foundation, which sponsors the tournament.</TE>
<TE>   Tonight, they must again persuade a jury that the imaginary Beck
Martin killed Anne Marcus after she told high school authorities that
Martin had stolen an English test.</TE>
<TE>   "Too many people concentrate on the competition, but that's
obviously not what it's all about. The educational aspect is very
important," said mock trial organizer Laura Wesley. "But it's still a
big deal. There are 8,000 students from all over California that want
to win to represent California at the nationals."</TE>
<TE>   Zepeda and Uong will be wearing the suits bought in the downtown
fashion alley. The two Manual Arts seniors said they would try to win
the same way they bought their suits -- by working together.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not all about the individual," Zepeda said. "It's about the
team."</TE>

<HD>Hahn Hopes to Bag a Pair of Pandas on Far East Trip</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Beth Shuster</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As Los Angeles Mayor James K. Hahn travels through Asia this week,
his stated goals are to boost tourism and drum up business for the
airport and harbor. But the big prize he seeks is a coveted set of
Chinese souvenirs: a pair of giant pandas.</LD>
<LD>   That's no easy task. Getting a pair of the rare creatures -- once
considered more akin to big raccoons than little bears but now
generally credited with legitimate membership in the bear family --
will require smart politics and substantial investment.</LD>
<LD>   The Chinese government rations out its panda loans, carefully
picking which U.S. cities and zoos deserve a chance to display and
breed the lumbering animals, which can weigh as much as 250 pounds in
the wild.</LD>
<TE>   Memphis, Tenn., Las Vegas and Oakland are among the cities in the
hunt. The winners will get to borrow a pair of the gentle animals,
which zoo-goers flock to see. For the losers, panda pens will go
empty, and the Chinese government has a disappointing consolation
prize: a golden monkey.</TE>
<TE>   Panda lobbying is long, expensive and political. It can take
millions of dollars, substantial political capital and years of
effort. Indeed, Hahn could be out of office before the city learns if
it will ever receive the pandas. He is undeterred.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a huge feather in a city's cap if they can get a panda," the
mayor said in an interview before he took off for Seoul last weekend.
"It's a very good investment for the entire zoo to have pandas. They
are a marquee exhibit. It would be huge."</TE>
<TE>   Enchanted by the possibility that Los Angeles might get its own
pandas, city officials traveling this week with Hahn are navigating
diplomatic niceties as they gently press their case. Among other
things, Hahn is expected to argue that Los Angeles' status as a
gateway city to Asia and its large Chinese population would make it a
suitable home for the animals.</TE>
<TE>   David Towne, a consultant to the Los Angeles Zoo and the head of
the Giant Panda Conservation Foundation, is going to Beijing to help
Hahn land pandas. A big part of his message is patience and attention
to detail.</TE>
<TE>   "I've tried to advise the folks here: Do not put the Chinese on
the spot by announcing that you're getting the pandas," Towne said in
an interview. "It works against you. It embarrasses you and it puts
pressure on them. You have to develop rapport ... and relationships.
There's nothing like long-term relationships."</TE>
<TE>   Only three zoos in the United States have pandas: the National Zoo
in Washington, D.C., which has two; Zoo Atlanta, which has a pair;
and the San Diego Zoo, which has two adults and a younger animal that
soon will be returned to China. China requires that all pandas lent
out to zoos abroad be returned to China, usually within 10 years. Any
babies born to their pandas must be returned to China by age 3.</TE>
<TE>   The mayor will find himself in line with others seeking pandas.
The Memphis Zoo, for example, already has received word that its
request for pandas has been approved in principle by the Chinese
Assn. of Zoological Gardens. The Mandalay Bay Resort on the Las Vegas
Strip also has been lobbying and the city of Oakland has expressed
interest.</TE>
<TE>   Bagging pandas typically is reserved for wealthy or politically
connected exhibitors. And, as with so many things, powerful friends
don't hurt.</TE>
<TE>   The Memphis Zoo's effort, for example, was launched in 1999 by
former Tennessee Sen. James Sasser, then the U.S. ambassador to
China. He began talks with the Chinese government that have
continued, even though he is no longer there.</TE>
<TE>   Zoo Atlanta also received well-placed help, in its case from
former President Carter.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles leaders recognize that Hahn does not exactly pack
Carter's wallop. Because of that, experts in the field of panda
acquisition say, Hahn would need to win support from California's
congressional delegation and from Chinese officials in this country,
as well.</TE>
<TE>   Money also helps.</TE>
<TE>   The cities that are successful in receiving pandas pledge millions
to the Chinese government to help protect the dwindling wild
populations of the animals. There are about 1,000 left in the wild in
China and several hundred in captivity. The goal for U.S. zoos is to
produce offspring.</TE>
<TE>   For Hahn to be successful in scoring the pandas, he would have to
commit tens of millions of dollars to the effort, according to Towne,
who has advised other cities as well.</TE>
<TE>   The Griffith Park zoo would need to build a state-of-the-art panda
exhibit, which would include a breeding area and could cost $10
million to $12 million; Los Angeles would have to pay China about
$1.2 million per year for 10 years for the loan agreement; and the
city probably would spend at least another $1.2 million building
relationships with China, to help with its conservation programs, and
in other costs. (That money could be raised from private sources or
taxpayers.)</TE>
<TE>   In Memphis, zoo officials built a $16-million, 3-acre panda
exhibit well before they received any indication that they might
actually get the animals.</TE>
<TE>   Aside from the money, Los Angeles also would need to meet criteria
outlined by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, the agency
responsible for issuing the import and export permits for pandas. The
animals are protected by the U.S. Endangered Species Act and the
Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species.</TE>
<TE>   Among other things, Los Angeles would have to demonstrate a
specific research project that would benefit the wild panda
population in China. In San Diego, zoo officials are examining the
way giant pandas communicate, said Don Lindberg, coordinator of the
species survival plan for the American Zoo and Aquarium Assn., who is
based in San Diego.</TE>
<TE>   Memphis Zoo officials have pledged to study pandas' nutrition,
should they receive a pair. Los Angeles has yet to say what it might
do for them.</TE>
<TE>   Pandas can be a huge draw for zoos, particularly in the first few
years, and especially if they have offspring, said Patricia Fisher, a
Fish and Wildlife Service spokeswoman in Washington. They can
generate substantial profits when they are displayed. Money from
panda-related souvenirs typically is returned to China, she said.</TE>
<TE>   For years after former President Nixon was given a pair of pandas
as a gift from Mao Zedong, attendance at the National Zoo soared,
officials said.</TE>
<TE>   Hsing-Hsing and Ling-Ling were the first pandas in a U.S. zoo
since the death of a panda in the Brookfield Zoo in Chicago in 1953.
On the Sunday in 1972 when the pandas were first exhibited, 75,000
people visited the National Zoo. By the end of the first year,
reports say, 1.1 million visitors saw them. (Curiously, Nixon never
went to see them.) The San Diego Zoo had high attendance even before
it received its two pandas in 1996, said a zoo spokeswoman, Christina
Simmons. In fact, she said, the pandas have not generated a huge
boost in income to the zoo. When the baby was born in August 1999 and
finally put on exhibit, Simmons said, it was a rainy morning with
more media representatives present than visitors.</TE>
<TE>   But Zoo Atlanta has benefited from its pandas, Lun-Lun and
Yang-Yang, which arrived in 1999. They were flown to the United
States on a specially equipped United Parcel Service plane, and then
whisked off to their new $7-million home. The zoo even installed a
camera in the facility so that the animals, though not the most
energetic of creatures, can be viewed on the Internet.</TE>
<TE>   And though Los Angeles has never had a panda of its own, it did
get a brief glimpse of the animals -- a look that tantalized some
local leaders.</TE>
<TE>   In 1984, the Chinese government allowed one of its pandas to come
to Los Angeles for the Summer Olympics. Hahn, for one, was struck by
the interest.</TE>
<TE>   "I remember the lines were incredible," the mayor said. "It was a
great boost for the zoo."</TE>
<TE>   In the early 1990s, extreme pandering for pandas in this country
led to a five-year moratorium on importing them. The ban was lifted
in 1998 after the U.S. and Chinese governments agreed to a series of
steps to avoid imports for purely commercial purposes.
Conservationists feared that humans would love the pandas to death,
according to the Fish and Wildlife Service.</TE>
<TE>   San Diego, with its world-renowned zoo, was the first city to
receive the pandas under the new policy. Lindberg, who works at the
zoo, said he would welcome the opportunity to have another panda
research center so close, if L.A. were successful.</TE>
<TE>   But that proximity also could be a drawback for Los Angeles. As
Towne said, "Politically, they'll be weighing: Is it more important
here -- so close to San Diego -- or would it be potentially better
for St. Louis or Chicago?"</TE>
<TE>   With so many things to consider, many panda experts warn that Hahn
won't get any promises when he meets with Beijing zoo officials. He
does hope at least to enter into an agreement to open discussions
about animal exchanges. Ideally, that would be the first step toward
getting the pandas.</TE>
<TE>   People close to Hahn say he's eager to make any progress he can
during this trip -- and to eventually see a panda exhibit at his
hometown zoo.</TE>
<TE>   "The mayor's taken with them," Towne said. "I'm not sure if he
loves pandas, or if he loves having a high-profile animal here. He's
certainly interested in this."</TE>

<LD>U.S. meat companies that do not routinely test their plants for the
potentially deadly bacterium listeria will be subject to increased
food-safety inspections starting next month, the Agriculture
Department said.</LD>
<LD>   The USDA's directive, which takes effect Dec. 9, came in reaction
to a summer listeria outbreak that killed seven people in the
Northeast and prompted the nation's largest meat recall.</LD>

<LD>A federal judge ruled that a Ten Commandments monument installed in
Alabama's judicial building by the state's chief justice must be
removed because it violates the separation of church and state.</LD>
<LD>   "Its sloping top and the religious air of the tablets
unequivocally call to mind an open Bible resting on a podium," U.S.
District Judge Myron Thompson said. Chief Justice Roy Moore's
attorney said the chief justice would appeal.</LD>

<LD>A state appeals court halted this week's scheduled execution of a
convicted killer after his attorneys argued that he is mentally
retarded.</LD>
<LD>   James Lee Clark, 34, was scheduled to die by injection Thursday
for the 1993 shooting, rape, robbery and murder of a 17-year-old
Denton high school student. Another teenager was slain in the same
incident.</LD>
<LD>   Clark's lawyers invoked a recent U.S. Supreme Court ruling barring
execution of the mentally retarded. The court agreed to review that
claim, delaying Clark's execution indefinitely.</LD>

<HD>$100-Million Gift Is Pure Poetry to Magazine</HD>
<DH>Rejected submissions don't deter lifelong lover of verse
from donation that transforms journal.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Eric Slater</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>CHICAGO</DL>
<LD>Growing up in a secretive family of almost unfathomable wealth,
driven to school by Pinkerton guards who took a different route each
day to throw off would-be kidnappers, Ruth Lilly explored the world
mostly through poetry.</LD>
<LD>   As she grew up, she began to write poems of her own, publishing a
few, under a pseudonym. They were pretty good, a top editor would say
later, but not great. Over the years she began making her
contribution not with words but with dollars, creating several
prizes, including one of the poetry world's jackpots, the $100,000
Ruth Lilly Poetry Prize.</LD>
<LD>   Frail now at 87, and requiring a nurse to help her finish reading
longer poems, the last surviving great-grandchild of pharmaceutical
magnate Eli Lilly has changed the landscape of American poetry
publishing with a single gift. Her $100-million endowment has
instantly turned Poetry magazine from the most highly regarded but
also perennially penniless American poetry journal into the world's
largest foundation for verse.</LD>
<TE>   This is after editors at Chicago-based Poetry returned Lilly's own
poems, along with kind but clear rejection letters, time and again.</TE>
<TE>   As word of the reclusive billionaire's latest generosity spread
over the weekend, poets expressed the thanks of those who know they
will always struggle to earn a living. "This is wonderful," said
Campbell McGrath, 40, the recipient of MacArthur, Guggenheim and
several other prestigious awards.</TE>
<TE>   "Most poets live paycheck to paycheck, but the paycheck is from
another job, it's not from writing poetry,'' McGrath, who teaches
writing at Florida International University, said Monday. "I hope
that, as much as possible, [Poetry magazine] will find a way to call
up individual poets and say: 'You're not going to believe this, but
we're going to give you money.' "</TE>
<TE>   Since poets who make it into the magazine currently earn $2 a line
whether they are Nobel laureates or graduate students, editors said
they expect to pay more and still have money for endowments, to move
out of their cramped space in the Newberry Library downtown and to
make a home for thousands of largely forgotten books of poetry, among
other projects.</TE>
<TE>   For years, Lilly submitted poems to the magazine, only no one knew
it, not until recent years. The envelopes came from Indianapolis,
from a Mrs. Guernsey Van Riper Jr., Lilly's name before she divorced.</TE>
<TE>   Even if she had gone by Lilly, and even if the editors had figured
out she was that Lilly, it wouldn't have mattered a whit, said Joe
Parisi, who has edited Poetry for 26 years and probably wrote many of
Lilly's rejection letters. The magazine, after all, has published --
and rejected -- poems from virtually every giant of 20th century
verse, from Robert Frost to Carl Sandburg to William Butler Yeats.</TE>
<TE>   "I think maybe the fact that we judged works on their merit and
not on who wrote them, that may have had something to do with her
giving us this gift," Parisi said. "I think she might have decided we
would continue to be responsible, discerning."</TE>
<TE>   Founded in 1912 by onetime Chicago Tribune art critic Harriet
Monroe, the monthly publication is the oldest and, many believe,
preeminent poetry journal in the English language. The magazine, with
a paid circulation of just 10,000, published the first seminal poems
of Sandburg, T.S. Eliot, William Carlos Williams, Marianne Moore,
Ezra Pound and others.</TE>
<TE>   It is, however, a poetry journal in the land and time of the
"poetry slam," which, even with stage lights and considerable
shouting, seems unable to attract an audience. So while Poetry
magazine receives 90,000 submissions annually, there are just four
staff members to read them. Those four also do the typesetting, run
the magazine's Web site, write grants and otherwise plead for money
-- which has left the publication on the precipice of failure at
least eight times in its history, more than once with less than $100
in the bank.</TE>
<TE>   Then the staffers must edit the poems to be published, which often
means fighting with, and then massaging the egos of, the poets. And
finally they send out those 89,500 or so rejection letters each year.
"Oh, in the old days, some editors were just ruthless in their
responses. I am the very essence of sweetness and light," Parisi
said.</TE>
<TE>   It is not clear when Lilly decided she'd been rejected enough by
Parisi and his predecessors at Poetry, though it probably came
sometime before those letters were written, and kept, on computer.
Parisi doesn't remember any of Lilly's poems, and he's never met the
woman.</TE>
<TE>   But, with a touch of seriousness in his voice, he says he would
have been kind regardless. "I often write that it's probably my fault
the poem didn't make it, that I'm sorry for being so dimwitted. I get
letters from people thanking me for my rejection letters."</TE>
<TE>   Thomas Ewbank, who has worked with the Lilly family since the
1960s and is Ruth Lilly's personal lawyer, says his client was "not
offended" by Poetry's repeated rejections. But by the early 1980s,
his reclusive client, who still lives outside Indianapolis, had grown
less interested in her own poetry than in funding the form,
especially modern American poetry.</TE>
<TE>   "Her goal has been to try and build up the amount of public
support and public notice of poetry," Ewbank said. In 1986, she
established the Ruth Lilly Poetry Prize, which started at $25,000 and
grew to $100,000. She then began sponsoring two $15,000 fellowships
through Poetry magazine, and a professorship at Indiana University.</TE>
<TE>   Parisi announced Lilly's latest offering at a quiet dinner for the
art community here Friday night. By midday Monday, a woman from
Tennessee was calling the magazine saying she had some poems, would
they please send money?</TE>
<TE>   The deal is complicated, involving six accounts and payments
spread over 30 years. As publisher of the magazine, the Modern Poetry
Assn. will have to change its status with the Internal Revenue
Service from tax-exempt to that of a private foundation. The
$100-million figure is an estimate, and a conservative one; depending
on the performance of Eli Lilly stock, the value could turn out to be
closer to $150 million.</TE>
<TE>   Many poets were happy to leave the details to Parisi, who said he
was thrilled at the notion of never having to beg for money again.</TE>
<TE>   This year's recipient of the Ruth Lilly Poetry Prize, Lisel
Mueller, has enjoyed extraordinary success as a poet, including
winning the Pulitzer Prize in 1997 for her book "Alive Together: New
and Selected Poems."</TE>
<TE>   Still, the 77-year-old resident of an assisted living home in
Chicago could never have written what she's written had she been
responsible for paying the rent. "My late husband worked, thank
goodness," the German-born Mueller said. "That's why I could write.
It's a dark time for poetry, but it's very encouraging to hear
somebody has that much faith."</TE>

<HD>Court Widens Wiretapping in Terror Cases</HD>
<DH>Panel lowers the 'wall' between intelligence agencies and
the FBI. Ashcroft lauds the ruling, but some fear a loss of civil
liberties.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>David G. Savage and Henry Weinstein</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Atty. Gen. John Ashcroft and the FBI have broad power to wiretap the
phones and secretly search the computers and homes of individuals who
can be linked to foreign terrorists, a special spy review court ruled
Monday.</LD>
<LD>   Proclaiming a major victory in the war on terrorism, Ashcroft said
the decision "revolutionizes our ability to investigate and prosecute
terrorists" because it permits criminal investigators and
intelligence agents to work together and to share information.</LD>
<LD>   Ann Beeson, who heads the American Civil Liberties Union's
Technology and Liberty program, said she was "deeply disappointed
with the decision, which suggests that this special court exists only
to rubber-stamp government applications for intrusive surveillance
warrants." Other lawyers were uncertain whether the case could be
appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court.</LD>
<TE>   Until now, the government has been told to maintain a "wall"
between its spying on foreign agents and its investigation of
ordinary criminals.</TE>
<TE>   In Monday's opinion, the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court
of Review cast aside that concept. "There is simply no basis [in law]
to limit criminal prosecutors' ability to advise FBI intelligence
officials" on undertaking searches or sharing the results -- and vice
versa, the review court said.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, as a policy matter, the court said,
"counterintelligence brings to bear both classic criminal
investigation techniques as well as less focused
intelligence-gathering. Indeed, effective counterintelligence, we
have learned, requires the wholehearted cooperation of all the
government's personnel who can be brought to the task. A standard
which punishes such cooperation could well be thought dangerous to
national security."</TE>
<TE>   The court's three federal appeals court judges were appointed by
Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist with the sole mission to review
rulings from the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, which was
created in 1978 to oversee particularly sensitive law-enforcement
activities, including wiretaps and other forms of surveillance,
against suspected spies, terrorists and foreign agents.</TE>
<TE>   All three judges on the review court -- Ralph B. Guy of the 6th
Circuit in Cincinnati, Edward Leavy of the 9th Circuit in San
Francisco and Laurence H. Silberman of the D.C. Circuit -- were
originally named to the federal bench by President Reagan.</TE>
<TE>   In May, the seven-member Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court
ruled that Ashcroft was improperly trying to broaden the FBI's spying
abilities. His actions were based on the USA Patriot Act, passed in
the aftermath of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, which appeared to
lower the wall between intelligence gathering and criminal
investigations.</TE>
<TE>   That decision, made public in August by the Senate Judiciary
Committee, which had been pushing for information about the secret
court, contained blistering criticism of the FBI and the Justice
Department. The decision accused the FBI of misleading the FISA court
in 75 cases, all during the tenure of FBI Director Louis J. Freeh.</TE>
<TE>   The spy court spurned a request from the Justice Department to
permit broader cooperation between criminal prosecutors and
counterintelligence investigators, saying the request was "not
reasonably designed" to safeguard the privacy of Americans.</TE>
<TE>   Monday's ruling reverses that decision and upholds Ashcroft's
initiative.</TE>
<TE>   In response, Ashcroft ordered an immediate stepped-up use of "the
powerful tools of foreign intelligence surveillance."</TE>
<TE>   Officials said the ruling allows the CIA and the FBI to work
together and share information on potential terrorists. However, they
also stressed that there would be continued limits on the
government's power.</TE>
<TE>   The expanded wiretap power applies only to cases involving
"serious foreign threats to national security," not to "ordinary
crimes," the review court said.</TE>
<TE>   The Cold War-era division between intelligence-gathering and
criminal investigation grew from much-publicized abuses of the
government's spying power under Presidents Kennedy, Johnson and
Nixon. Civil rights leaders, including the Rev. Martin Luther King
Jr., and Vietnam War protesters were spied upon in the guise of
protecting national security.</TE>
<TE>   In reaction, Congress passed the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance
Act in 1978 to limit the government's power to wiretap and break into
homes.</TE>
<TE>   But after Sept. 11, the wall between criminal investigation and
intelligence-gathering was faulted as outdated and dangerous. The FBI
and the CIA were accused of failing to "connect the dots" in a way
that might have prevented a terrorist group from carrying out an
attack in the United States.</TE>
<TE>   For example, an FBI agent in Phoenix expressed concern about
Middle Eastern men taking flight lessons, yet this information was
not shared with the CIA, which had learned of Al Qaeda's plans to
hijack planes.</TE>
<TE>   The case of Zacarias Moussaoui, the accused 20th hijacker, also
illustrates the gaps in the previous policy.</TE>
<TE>   In August 2001, weeks before the attacks on the World Trade Center
and the Pentagon, Moussaoui was taken into custody by FBI agents in
Minnesota because of his strange behavior. He was taking lessons on
how to fly a jumbo jet, but said he did not need to learn to land it.</TE>
<TE>   But the Minneapolis agents were blocked from examining his laptop
computer because they had no evidence he was a criminal. However, CIA
agents in France had learned of his ties to suspected terrorists.</TE>
<TE>   Had this information been fully shared among agents, the
government might have obtained a FISA warrant that could have
revealed key information before Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   In a normal criminal probe, government investigators must have
good evidence of wrongdoing before they can obtain a search warrant.
The 4th Amendment says warrants should be issued only when there is
"probable cause" to believe a crime is taking place.</TE>
<TE>   In contrast, the FBI can obtain a wiretap warrant for "foreign
intelligence surveillance" simply by showing the target is linked to
a foreign power or an international terrorist group. The individual
may be entirely innocent, but the government can obtain an order to
tap his phone or secretly break in to his residence.</TE>
<TE>   FBI agents can obtain these search warrants rather easily through
the secret FISA court. In fact, legal experts said that until the
ruling in May, the department had never been turned down on any of
these requests.</TE>
<TE>   At a news conference, Ashcroft stressed that the government was
not being given a free hand to spy on ordinary Americans.</TE>
<TE>   "We haven't really changed the threshold" for undertaking a
search, he said. Agents must still show that the target is tied to a
foreign terrorist group.</TE>
<TE>   Rather, "this will greatly enhance our ability to put the pieces
together" to make better use of intelligence information, Ashcroft
added.</TE>
<TE>   Several civil liberties organizations filed friend-of-the-court
briefs in the case, but they were not permitted to argue in court
against U.S. Solicitor General Theodore B. Olson, who presented the
government's case. That is because when the government seeks a
wiretap order under FISA, it is the only party in the case. And the
same holds true for the review court.</TE>
<TE>   Consequently, attorneys who challenged the government actions are
not clear whether they have standing to file an appeal, said Beeson
of the ACLU and Marc Rotenberg of the Electronic Privacy Information
Center in Washington, one of the groups that filed a brief. That
alone is troubling, said Rotenberg.</TE>
<TE>   "It can't be the case that a government search fundamentally
escapes review by the highest court in the land," Rotenberg said.</TE>
<TE>   "Congress should not lose sight of the fact that when FISA was
created there was an intent to assure some accountability" in the way
intelligence surveillance was conducted, Rotenberg added. "It is too
easy to view FISA as an exception to the 4th Amendment. Neither the
courts or Congress have reached that result, but this decision gets
very close to that."</TE>
<TE>   Joshua L. Dratel, a New York attorney who was the co-author of a
friend-of-the-court brief filed by the National Assn. of Criminal
Defense Lawyers, said he was very troubled by the ruling --
particularly that it seemed to ignore the May findings of the spy
court.</TE>
<TE>   "Having discovered that the fox had been eating chickens for the
last 25 years, the court decided that the solution was to give the
fox more authority over the chicken coop and to stop monitoring it,"
said Dratel, who was the co-counsel for Wadih El-Hage, who is now
serving a life sentence in the United States for helping plan the
1998 U.S. Embassy bombings in Tanzania and Kenya.</TE>
<TE>   Dratel said that it would now be easier for the government to use
the FISA court to obtain a judicial order to wiretap or search the
offices of a businessman suspected of money-laundering if the case
involved activity in the Middle East or South America or some other
place that has "a terrorist penumbra." Moreover, Dratel said that
unless the person eventually was charged with a crime, he might never
know that the search or the wiretap had been conducted.</TE>
<TE>   Legal scholars were divided on the merits of the ruling. "I think
the court got it right," said Robert F. Turner, associate director of
the Center for National Security Law at the University of Virginia.
"The government is trying to protect our lives by inconveniencing us
some," said Turner, who was an attorney in the Defense and State
departments during the Reagan administration.</TE>
<TE>   But Eric M. Freedman, a constitutional law professor at Hofstra
University Law School in Hempstead, N.Y., said the decision "was an
abrogation of judicial responsibility to enforce the Bill of Rights."</TE>
<TE>   "This is an extraordinarily ominous moment for civil liberties in
this country," Freedman said.</TE>
<TE>   "If we don't believe in civil liberties in a time of crisis, how
can we persuade other countries to do that?"</TE>

<HD>U.S. Probes Alleged LAPD Beating</HD>
<DH>Officers are accused of vigilantism after a colleague's car
was hit by a beer can.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Scott Glover and Matt Lait</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The U.S. Department of Justice has opened an investigation into an
alleged vigilante mission by a group of Los Angeles police officers
accused of tracking down and beating a young man who had thrown a
half-empty can of beer at an off-duty officer's car.</LD>
<LD>   A federal prosecutor in Washington has requested court documents,
transcripts, police records and other information about the Feb. 8,
1999, incident as part of an investigation into alleged civil rights
violations, according to attorneys contacted by the Justice
Department official.</LD>
<LD>   "The Civil Rights Division is reviewing the matter to see what, if
any, actions under federal civil rights statutes may be appropriate,"
said Casey Stavropoulos, a spokeswoman for the Justice Department in
Washington.</LD>
<TE>   The incident, which was detailed in a Times article last year,
began when Travis Garlits, 21, threw the can at an officer's car. It
ended with officers tracing Garlits to a Mission Hills home about
10:45 p.m., where he was watching television with friends. Witnesses
said the officers burst into the house with guns drawn and ordered
everyone to the floor.</TE>
<TE>   One officer beat the man, witnesses said.</TE>
<TE>   The officer was quoted as telling Garlits that he had messed "with
the LAPD," as he allegedly punched and kneed Garlits. "That was my
partner you threw the beer can at."</TE>
<TE>   In addition to the alleged beating of Garlits, police shot and
wounded Steven Short, the owner of the house, who later told police
he had been awakened by the commotion and grabbed his shotgun.
According to a report later by the Police Commission's inspector
general, Jeffrey C. Eglash, by the time Short realized that the
intruders were police and started to drop his gun, it was too late:
An officer shot him in the hip. .</TE>
<TE>   Short sued the city and received a $300,000 settlement.</TE>
<TE>   The case set off heated debate on the commission. Some
commissioners accused the officers of taking the law into their own
hands and exacting revenge on Garlits. Eglash recommended that the
case be submitted to the U.S. attorney for potential prosecution of
the officers. But the case was never submitted by the LAPD for
prosecution.</TE>
<TE>   It is unclear what brought up the Justice Department's recent
interest in the case, now nearly 3 years old. Assistant U.S. Atty.
Jerrob Duffy, who is based in Washington and who contacted attorneys
connected to the case, declined to comment. A lawyer for the city of
Los Angeles who represented the officers in the suit brought by Short
was not available to discuss the Civil Rights Division actions; the
officers previously have declined to comment.</TE>
<TE>   Attorney Carol Watson, who represented Short, said Duffy told her
in a telephone conversation last week that he was pursuing a possible
criminal civil rights prosecution against the officers.</TE>
<TE>   Duffy sought documents associated with the alleged beating and
asked her opinion about impression some of the alleged victims would
make as witnesses at trial, Watson and another attorney close to the
case said.</TE>
<TE>   An LAPD spokesman, Cmdr. Gary Brennan, said department officials
were unaware of the investigation and therefore could not comment on
it.</TE>
<TE>   According to police reports, Garlits threw the beer can at the car
driven by off-duty Officer Chad Butler, who was on his way home after
work. After his car was struck by the can, Butler drove to the
Foothill police station with the license plate number of the
suspects' car. After a DMV check of the plate, Butler and several
other on-duty officers headed to the address to which the vehicle was
registered.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Car Spotted</TE>
<TE>   On the way, the police reports said, the officers spotted the car
on the San Diego Freeway. The officers pulled the car over, forced
the driver, 22-year-old Kevin Cliborn, to lie on the side of the road
and arrested him.</TE>
<TE>   Garlits was no longer in the car. Cliborn alleged that the
officers demanded that he tell them where Garlits was. Cliborn said
he didn't know the address of the house where his friend was staying,
only the phone number.</TE>
<TE>   The officers forced him to call the number and get the address
without saying that he was coming with police, Cliborn said.</TE>
<TE>   With that information, the officers headed to Short's home. On the
way to the residence, Cliborn said, one officer told him that he
hoped Garlits would "resist arrest," according to a confidential
report by Eglash.</TE>
<TE>   When police arrived, they said, they noticed that the front door
was slightly ajar. One of the officers said he knocked on the door
and identified himself as a police officer. The knock caused the door
to swing open, he said. In the living room, the officers found
Garlits and his friends watching television.</TE>
<TE>   Police said Garlits tried to escape and had to be forcefully
subdued by Officer Jeffrey Nuttall. At the same time, police said,
Short bolted out of a bedroom with a shotgun and pointed it at
another officer. That officer, Michael Patton, said he yelled at
Short to drop the gun, but the officer said Short refused and started
to aim the weapon at the officer's head. Fearing for his life, Patton
said, he shot Short.</TE>
<TE>   The accounts provided by Garlits, Cliborn, Short and others in the
house contradicted the police version of events. They said the
officers had burst in without warning. Nuttall seized Garlits, they
said, and started beating him in the hallway, telling Garlits that he
shouldn't have thrown the beer can at Nuttall's partner and asking
Garlits to "please resist me."</TE>
<TE>   After the shooting, the non-police witnesses said, Short asked
Patton why he had pulled the trigger. "Why did you shoot me?" one
witness quoted Short as asking the officer. "You came into my house.
I didn't know you were the police. I was trying to drop the gun."</TE>
<TE>   Eglash wrote two reports to the Police Commission on the incident,
both condemning the officers' actions. In one, Eglash accused
then-Chief Bernard C. Parks of refusing to discipline the officers
because Parks disapproved of the way the commission had handled its
review of the shooting. The chief denied that charge.</TE>
<TE>   Despite their concerns about the incident, police commissioners
found that the shooting had been within departmental rules, which
allow officers to fire their guns to protect themselves or others
from imminent harm, regardless of the circumstances that led up to
the shooting.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Case Settled</TE>
<TE>   More than a year later, the inspector general's reports once again
were the center of controversy. When The Times wrote about the
incident and detailed the contents of the reports, the judge who had
presided over Short's civil trial fined the city more than $22,000
and ordered a new trial because the reports had not been turned over
to Short's attorney. The city then settled the case out of court.</TE>
<TE>   Watson, Short's attorney, said the Justice Department prosecutor
told her that the federal probe is not focused on the shooting.</TE>
<TE>   She said Duffy had told her that he thought the fact that Short
was armed would be difficult to overcome in any potential
prosecution, regardless of the circumstances the led up the shooting.</TE>

<HD>James Coburn, 74; Actor Won an Oscar Late in His Career</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Louis Sahagun</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>James Coburn, the big, versatile leading man with a toothy grin who
appeared in such films as "Our Man Flint" and "Affliction," for which
he won an Academy Award, died Monday afternoon at his Beverly Hills
home. He was 74.</LD>
<LD>   Coburn died of a massive heart attack while listening to music
with his wife, Paula, his manager, Hillard Elkins, said late Monday.</LD>
<LD>   "He died too early, but he died in his wife's arms," Elkins said.
"It's a pity and a loss for all of us."</LD>
<TE>   The tall, ruggedly handsome actor won his best supporting actor
Oscar in 1999 after overcoming a decade-long struggle with arthritis
that left one hand crippled.</TE>
<TE>   Born in Laurel, Neb., on Aug. 31, 1928, Coburn grew up in Compton
and majored in acting at Los Angeles City College. He also attended
USC. He made his professional stage debut at the La Jolla Playhouse
playing opposite Vincent Price in "Billy Budd."</TE>
<TE>   In the early 1950s, he studied with Stella Adler in New York and
worked behind the scenes in television commercials. By decade's end,
he was working in Los Angeles in "Wagon Train" and "Alfred Hitchcock
Presents."</TE>
<TE>   After playing macho sidekicks and villains in numerous Westerns
and action films, he caught the public's attention in 1960 as the
knife-throwing Britt in "The Magnificent Seven."</TE>
<TE>   In 1965, he played the supporting role of a one-armed scout for
Charlton Heston in "Major Dundee."</TE>
<TE>   Coburn hit his stride as a leading man in the late 1960s James
Bond spy spoofs "Our Man Flint" and "In Like Flint." He produced the
comedy thriller "The President's Analyst" in 1967.</TE>
<TE>   His box-office appeal diminished in the late 1970s. He all but
disappeared from the camera's eye in the 1980s with the onset of
arthritis, which he claimed to have healed by taking pills with a
sulfur base. But he added a distinctive voice to a variety of
television commercials and had a lucrative career, particularly in
Japan, during that period.</TE>
<TE>   In the late 1980s, he returned to character roles. He played a
cattle rancher in "Young Guns II," a mysterious and deadly agent in
"The Candy Bars," a scrooge who wanted to shut down St. Francis
Academy in "Sister Act II: Back in the Habit" and a philanthropist in
the 1996 remake of "The Nutty Professor."</TE>
<TE>   But 1998 was an exceptional year for Coburn, when he won raves for
his role as the abusive, alcoholic father of Nick Nolte's character
in Paul Schrader's "Affliction."</TE>
<TE>   Winning on his first Oscar nomination in a career that spanned
four decades, Coburn cradled the golden statuette in his arm
backstage at the 71st Academy Awards and crowed, "Whoopee! It's nice!</TE>
<TE>   "You can't describe the feeling," he said. "You can't really
describe it because it's not even an emotion. It really hasn't
settled in yet. I was moved so much I could hardly talk up there."</TE>
<TE>   Television credits followed: "The Cherokee Kid," "The Second Civil
War," "Proximity" for HBO, and Hallmark Hall of Fame's "Noah's Ark."</TE>
<TE>   His recent film credits include "Snow Dogs" and "Monsters Inc." In
current release, he stars in "The Man From Elysian Fields," and
another movie is working its way into distribution, "American Gun."</TE>
<TE>   Coburn lent his talents to more than 100 films in all. Among his
personal favorites were "Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid" and "The Iron
Cross," both of which teamed him with his friend, the late director
Sam Peckinpah.</TE>
<TE>   "There'll never be another like him," Elkins said. "When we were
kids, he and I and Steve McQueen hung out together. Those two made an
impression on generations, past, present and future."</TE>
<TE>   In addition to his wife, Coburn is survived by two children.</TE>

<HD>Suit on Behalf of Prisoners Blocked</HD>
<DH>Appeals court finds that L.A. coalition has no ties to
military detainees in Cuba.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Henry Weinstein</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A Los Angeles coalition of clergy, lawyers and professors cannot
press a court challenge on behalf of prisoners brought to Guantanamo
Bay naval station because they have not established a relationship
with the detainees, a federal appeals court in San Francisco ruled
Monday.</LD>
<LD>   The coalition, including USC law professor Erwin Chemerinsky and
Venice civil rights attorney Stephen Yagman, "has not demonstrated
any relationship with the detainees," the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of
Appeals ruled. "The record is devoid of any effort to even
communicate with the detainees." The decision upheld a ruling by U.S.
District Judge A. Howard Matz in Los Angeles.</LD>
<LD>   At the same time, the appellate court, in its 3-0 decision,
reversed Matz's ruling that no U.S. court has jurisdiction to
consider claims that the Guantanamo detainees are being held
unconstitutionally, without being charged with a crime.</LD>
<TE>   The appellate court ruled that Matz did not have the jurisdiction
"to hold that the constitutionally embedded right of habeas corpus
was suspended for all Guantanamo Bay detainees, without regard for
their particular circumstances."</TE>
<TE>   Since the coalition did not have standing to sue, it was
inappropriate for Matz to rule on the broader issue, the 9th Circuit
held, saying, "Courts should not adjudicate rights unnecessarily."</TE>
<TE>   The coalition's suit contended that hundreds of prisoners from 36
countries are being held at Guantanamo after being captured in
Afghanistan in violation of the Constitution and the Geneva
Conventions governing the treatment of war prisoners.</TE>
<TE>   The suit asserted that the detainees have been deprived of liberty
without due process of law, have not been informed of the nature and
cause of the accusations against them nor afforded the assistance of
counsel. The suit contends the detainees are entitled to be brought
before a civilian court in the United States and informed of their
charges, or be released.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   U.S. Urges Dismissal</TE>
<TE>   The Justice Department urged that the suit be dismissed,
describing the coalition as "uninvited meddlers," who had no idea
whether the detainees have any desire to have their cases adjudicated
in the U.S., "a nation against which they have waged war."</TE>
<TE>   Justice Department spokeswoman Barbara Comstock said Monday that
the department was pleased with the appellate ruling. "The military
has acted within its authority in detaining noncitizens captured in
combat outside of the United States," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Chemerinsky countered that "the decision makes new law that is
dangerous."</TE>
<TE>   "It is so important that if a person being held by the government
can't sue on his own behalf, that someone can sue on behalf of that
person," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Whether the Guantanamo detainees have any legal rights in the U.S.
judicial system is also at issue in a case pending in the federal
appeals court in Washington. Earlier this year, U.S. District Judge
Colleen Kollar- Kotelly ruled that the detainees, including suspected
members of Al Qaeda and the Taliban, have no right to a hearing in a
federal court, meaning that the military could hold them
indefinitely. The detainees' appeal is scheduled to be heard Dec. 2.</TE>
<TE>   There is one key distinction between that case and the one in Los
Angeles. In the Washington suit, a dozen detainees from Kuwait, two
British citizens and an Australian are being represented by attorneys
hired by their families.</TE>
<TE>   In both lawsuits, the defendants include President Bush, Secretary
of Defense Donald H. Rumsfeld and other federal officials. Rumsfeld
has said the prisoners were being interrogated to gather intelligence
and for possible court cases.</TE>
<TE>   In her 24-page opinion upholding Matz's ruling tossing out the
coalition's lawsuit, 9th Circuit Judge Kim M. Wardlaw said the case
"stands or falls on whether the coalition has standing to bring a
habeas petition on behalf of the Guantanamo Bay detainees."</TE>
<TE>   Wardlaw said it was well-established that a habeas corpus petition
could be filed by third parties on behalf of a prisoner. But she
quoted at length from Whitmore vs. Arkansas, the leading Supreme
Court decision on the issue, which said that " 'next friend' is by no
means granted automatically to whomever seeks to pursue an action on
behalf of another."</TE>
<TE>   The Whitmore decision held that a "next friend" must satisfy two
prerequisites to gain standing. First, he must provide an adequate
explanation -- such as inaccessibility, mental incompe- tence or
other disability -- why the prisoner can't have requested that the
suit be filed. And the "next friend" must show that he is truly
dedicated to the best interest of the prisoner.</TE>
<TE>   In this instance, Chemerinsky and Yagman said the detainees
"appear to be held incommunicado," and thus are physically blocked
from the courts.</TE>
<TE>   Wardlaw called this a "hyperbolic argument" lacking factual
support, because the prisoners have been "visited by members of the
International Red Cross and diplomats from their home countries, and
have had limited opportunities to write to friends and family
members."</TE>
<TE>   On the other hand, the judge acknowledged that "it is evident that
the detainees are being held in a secure facility in an isolated area
of the world, on a United States Naval Base in a foreign country, to
which United States citizens are severely restricted from traveling.
The detainees are not able to meet with lawyers, and have been denied
access to file petitions in United States courts on their own
behalf."</TE>
<TE>   Yet without a significant relationship, "however worthy and
high-minded the motives of 'next friends' may be, they inevitably run
the risk of making the actual defendant a pawn to be manipulated on a
chessboard larger than his own case," wrote Wardlaw, an appointee of
President Clinton, quoting an earlier Supreme Court decision.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Impact on Future Suits</TE>
<TE>   Chemerinsky's co-counsel, Yagman, said the appellate court's
secondary ruling on the jurisdiction issue was a silver lining in the
case, because it is a more significant issue and offered hope that
lawyers for the detainees could win the case in Washington.</TE>
<TE>   At the oral argument July 10, Deputy Solicitor Gen. Paul D.
Clement said Judge Matz was "exactly right" that no U.S. court had
jurisdiction over the detainees.</TE>
<TE>   Chemerinsky countered that there never had been a decision by the
Supreme Court or any federal appellate court denying "next friend"
standing when a prisoner had no access to a court and that without
this suit, "there's no way to protect the rights of these
individuals."</TE>
<TE>   Most of the leading cases in which there have been "next friend"
disputes involve the death penalty.</TE>
<TE>   Generally, in those cases, a prisoner is trying to forsake further
appeals and a third party -- such as a family member -- is attempting
to keep the case open. The critical question is whether the third
party truly has the prisoner's best interest at heart.</TE>
<TE>   Wardlaw's ruling was joined by Judges Marsha Berzon and John
Noonan, who respectively were appointed by presidents Clinton and
Reagan.</TE>

<HD>Crackdown Demanded on Skid Row Camps</HD>
<DH>Business group, officials say squalor is ruining downtown.
Activists say problem is lack of beds.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Carla Rivera</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A group of downtown Los Angeles civic leaders and residents on Monday
said the growing homeless population on skid row is a public health
and safety catastrophe and proposed that the city enact an
anti-encampment ordinance and other measures to improve conditions.</LD>
<LD>   The Central City Assn., backed by City Council members Jan Perry
and Tom La Bonge, Police Chief William J. Bratton and several other
advocacy groups, said the number of homeless living in squalor on
downtown streets -- many with severe mental illnesses and addictions
-- has reached crisis proportions and is threatening downtown's
economic revitalization.</LD>
<LD>   Some agencies that provide services to the homeless, however,
denounced the plan, saying it was merely another attempt to sweep the
streets of homeless people who have nowhere else to go.</LD>
<TE>   Putting an exclamation point on the concerns, Bratton said the
concentration of homeless downtown is worse than he has seen in New
York or Boston.</TE>
<TE>   According to city counts conducted for the 2000 Census, from 9,000
to 15,000 people live on the streets of central Los Angeles, said
Perry, as many as 3,000 to 5,000 of them on the 50 square blocks of
downtown's skid row. At the same time, the city is trying to attract
new residents to live in renovated loft buildings in the area.</TE>
<TE>   At a news conference at the newly rehabilitated Farmers and
Merchants Bank building on skid row's edge, the Central City Assn.
and its allies asserted that current ordinances are ineffective in
preventing public urination and defecation, camping on sidewalks and
aggressive panhandling.</TE>
<TE>   "We are focusing on a portion of the problem that no one has
wanted to talk about, those dwelling on the streets who have set up
tents and boxes," said Central City Assn. President Carol Schatz. "We
need to address that kind of behavior because it takes the streets
away from all of us."</TE>
<TE>   Her group is proposing a plan it says will improve the quality of
life downtown while also showing compassion for the truly sick and
needy.</TE>
<TE>   Besides the anti-encampment ordinance, proposals include:</TE>
<TE>   * Specific city bans on public urination and defecation. The acts
currently fall under the category of a nuisance crime, but are rarely
prosecuted, say civic officials.</TE>
<TE>   * Creation of an LAPD street-crime patrol with the purpose of
catching drug dealers and other criminals who prey on the homeless.</TE>
<TE>   * A city-financed downtown community court that would review petty
crimes and divert homeless offenders to social service agencies
rather than send them to jail.</TE>
<TE>   * Audits of the Los Angeles Homeless Services Agency and
individual service providers so they are held accountable for
spending government funds effectively on housing, counseling, job
training or other programs.</TE>
<TE>   * City- and county-funded treatment for recovering homeless drug
and alcohol addicts.</TE>
<TE>   * Coordination among law enforcement agencies to release prisoners
and parolees back into the communities where they were arrested
rather than dumping them downtown, as is now common practice.</TE>
<TE>   Bratton said he is studying proposals to beef up patrols downtown
but made no commitment.</TE>
<TE>   The new police chief, who is staying in a downtown hotel until he
finds a permanent home, said he and his wife had been accosted by
aggressive panhandlers several times while shopping.</TE>
<TE>   Over the weekend, a man being ejected from a skid row transient
hotel was stabbed to death with an ice pick, Bratton said.</TE>
<TE>   As New York commissioner, Bratton was credited with cracking down
on nuisance crimes such as panhandling and enforcing bans on sleeping
on the streets. "If left unchecked these behaviors destroy
neighborhoods, destroy cities and that's what's happening right
outside this door," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Other California cities, such as San Francisco and Santa Monica,
are getting tougher on squalid street conditions associated with some
homeless people.</TE>
<TE>   Some advocacy groups, however, said the Central City Assn. plan
fails to address the lack of shelter beds that leads many homeless to
sleep on the streets and said the group is motived by the economic
interests of its members.</TE>
<TE>   "Most addicts and mentally ill are not service-resistant," said
Gilbert Saldate, homeless coordinator for the Tri-City Mental Health
agency. "They want housing and supportive services desperately. What
they are resistant to are the rules, penalties and sanctions that
some service providers and governmental agencies put in their way."</TE>
<TE>   Bob Erlenbusch, executive director of the Coalition to End Hunger
and Homelessness, added: "Our position has always been framed by
compassion in the deepest sense of the word. We defend people's right
to sleep outside when there is no alternative."</TE>
<TE>   But Perry said a downtown redevelopment plan could provide needed
money for shelter, housing and social programs, and she lambasted
advocacy groups, including the Homeless Coalition, that have sued the
city to block it.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm very hopeful we'll settle these lawsuits very soon so we can
stop wasting time," said Perry, who called the situation on skid row
a "catastrophe."</TE>
<TE>   "It's neither compassionate nor humane to argue people have the
right to live on the streets in their own waste."</TE>

<HD>Lining Up to Be the Next 'Idol'</HD>
<DH>Thousands spend the weekend in a parking lot, rehearsing
for Fox TV's talent show.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>By 6 a.m., the line for the concrete bathrooms outside the Rose Bowl
was positively undulating as contestants hopped from foot to foot,
waiting. They entered wrapped in blankets. They emerged resplendent
in sequins and bright slashes of red leather.</LD>
<LD>   Auditions began Monday morning for the second season of Fox's
surprise television hit, "American Idol," transforming the Rose Bowl
into a glitter-dusted refugee camp for pop-star wannabes. Contestants
began assembling last Thursday and, by sunrise Monday, they were
almost 7,000 strong, 4,000 fresh-faced crooners with entourages of
parents, friends and cranky siblings.</LD>
<LD>   Dino Yazzie, 21, drove to Pasadena from a Navajo reservation in
Arizona, telling no one where he was headed, especially not his
father, who would have called the trip "a waste of time and gas." The
reservation gets only one mainstream radio station and the No. 1
single recorded by last year's winner, Texas cocktail waitress Kelly
Clarkson, plays on it nonstop.</LD>
<TE>   Joe Warrick, 22, of Merrillville, Ind., came to the Los Angeles
tryout after being rejected last year in Chicago and again this fall
in Detroit.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm determined. I'm going to get it one day," he said. "When I
sing for people, it is a love inside, a love like no other." Besides,
he added, "there's no need to say it, but the paychecks are not too
shabby."</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles is the final stop on a seven-city recruiting tour that
will yield about 30 contestants for the televised talent show, which
will air from January to April. The winner gets a $1-million
recording contract. The losers get ridiculed publicly by British
judge Simon Cowell. The tryouts have drawn about 25,000 amateur
vocalists nationwide, with the turnout in Los Angeles larger than any
other city, organizers said.</TE>
<TE>   Hopefuls passed the nervous, slow hours of waiting by chewing raw
garlic and drinking olive oil to coddle their vocal cords. Aged 16 to
24, with taste buds to match, they ate endless boxes of Cheese Nips
and tubes of Pringles. They spoke earnestly about their musical
influences (Britney vs. Christina, Justin vs. the Backstreet Boys).</TE>
<TE>   But mostly, they sang. And sang and sang.</TE>
<TE>   Late into Sunday evening, teenagers clustered in circles, singing
songs such as Michael Jackson's "You Are Not Alone" to each other.
Most eventually succumbed to exhaustion, but even at 2 a.m., the
parking lot continued to echo with cover tunes. At least one
contestant left his place in line to drive to the gym for a midnight
workout.</TE>
<TE>   The Palmer family, including contestant Jennifer, her twin sister
Jessica and parents Bill and Yvette, brought propane heaters from San
Diego, but they were forced to turn them off after security officials
deemed them fire hazards.</TE>
<TE>   Stephanie Nilsby nestled down between her mother and her mother's
friend under a mountain of bedding, trying to stay warm.</TE>
<TE>   Nilsby said she has wanted to sing, "Omigosh, since I was little!
I did my first solo when I was 5 at church." She traveled from Salem,
Ore., for the tryout and her hometown newspaper has already written
about her journey.</TE>
<TE>   As the auditions drew nearer, rumors whipped through the crowd:
Wristbands would be handed out at midnight. No, at 2 a.m. No, it
would be 8 a.m.</TE>
<TE>   Senior producer David Goffin laughed. "I told people nothing," he
said. He spent the night in a golf cart, circulating through the
crowd. "We wake everyone up at five."</TE>
<TE>   Why? Because it took two to three hours for the bedraggled campers
to transform themselves into proto-rock stars.</TE>
<TE>   Many emulated the provocative fashion stylings of their own
American entertainment idols.</TE>
<TE>   "You look at some of the kids and you think, 'It's a talent show.
Don't be nude,' " said Sharon Mongalo Johnson, of Long Beach, who
accompanied her son Alejandro Mongalo. Contestants under 18 needed to
be accompanied by parents or guardians.</TE>
<TE>   Johnson said she initially resisted her son's desire to be on
"American Idol." She envisions him at a top-rated university next
fall, and says proudly that he has the grades to get there.</TE>
<TE>   But she said she saw "that sparkle in his eye" and decided she
didn't want him always wondering if he could have made it if his
mother hadn't held him back. She almost changed her mind, however,
when she found out she would be spending the night on cold asphalt.</TE>
<TE>   At about 8 a.m., organizers began to issue numbers for contestants
to wear on their bellies. The first thousand walked through the Rose
Bowl gates. They were led single-file like ducklings to a white tent,
where they waited, again, to sing for the show's producers.</TE>
<TE>   Then, they were taken into rooms to perform for the judges. If
they did well, they went upstairs in the stadium and sang some more.</TE>
<TE>   Katie Smith, who came from Iowa for the tryout, glowed with
metallic glitter as she waited for her chance.</TE>
<TE>   "Singing is the only thing I've ever envisioned myself doing," she
said. "All my friends, my professors [at Drake University] ... they
call me rock star."</TE>
<TE>   The roughly 3,000 contestants left in the parking lot did not get
formal auditions Monday. They sang for producers who listened for as
little as three or four seconds before deciding their fate.</TE>
<TE>   About 1,200 of them received blue or orange wrist bands and an
invitation to sing for the show's producers today and Wednesday at
the Renaissance Hollywood Hotel.</TE>
<TE>   One producer, who would not give her name, held hopefuls' pillows,
sleeping bags and makeup valises while they belted out their hopes
and dreams.</TE>
<TE>   "No, I'm sorry," she said, over and over. "Thank you very much."</TE>
<TE>   Veronica Necochea and Tahphi Braswell, both 18, came to the
audition together from San Diego.</TE>
<TE>   "Did you get a wristband?" Veronica asked.</TE>
<TE>   "Yes," Tahphi said.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't," Veronica said. "Is that bad? That's it? That's it?"</TE>
<TE>   Goffin said the producers pick finalists based not only on singing
skill, but on personality and charisma. "You know it when you hear
it," he said. "You look for someone you can't take your eyes off."</TE>
<TE>   Goffin pooh-poohs accusations that producers select people based
on their looks or deliberately include a few tone-deaf croakers. The
producers are conscious that "these are kids' dreams we have out
here," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Some of the contestants burst into tears as they received the bad
news. Others took it with a stoic shrug. Yazzie, who came from the
Navajo reservation, sang just a few seconds of Whitney Houston's
"Miracle." For a moment he allowed himself to ponder the possibility
of winning, of quitting his job in the human resources office of a
Bureau of Indian Affairs school for a life of tours, music videos and
starlight.</TE>
<TE>   As he wandered off into the parking lot late Monday morning, he
wore a blue wrist band.</TE>
<TE>   "My voice is kind of shaking," he said. "I'm excited. I need to
drink like a gallon of water."</TE>

<HD>13 Die in Four Days of Violence</HD>
<DH>The deaths in unrelated incidents are in addition to four
fatalities in police shootings. City's toll for the year is
approaching 600.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Andrew Blankstein and Richard Winton</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Police are investigating 13 possible homicides that have taken place
since Friday, which would bring the Los Angeles toll this year to
592, surpassing the number slain in the city all of last year and
reaching the highest annual total since 1996, authorities said
Monday.</LD>
<LD>   "We had a particularly violent weekend in the city," said Los
Angeles Police Chief William J. Bratton. He recently warned that the
city could become the homicide capital of the United States by the
end of 2002.</LD>
<LD>   The deaths were in addition to five shootings by LAPD police
officers, two of them fatal, including one by an officer who has been
involved in two other shootings since 1999.</LD>
<TE>   Speaking at a news conference on the homeless, Bratton said the
department needs to review the cases involving officers.</TE>
<TE>   "We have to reinforce officer decision-making in how they decide
to use force," Bratton said. "We certainly want to make sure they
were in policy."</TE>
<TE>   Historically, the high point for killings in Los Angeles was 1,092
in 1992. The low point in recent years came in 1998 when 419
homicides were reported, according to the LAPD.</TE>
<TE>   Police said they are concerned about the latest wave of violence
in a year in which the city's homicide rate has steadily climbed for
three years.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the killings were in South Los Angeles. At least seven are
believed to have been gang-related. Nine victims died from gunshot
wounds and two from stabbings. The other two may have been fatally
beaten.</TE>
<TE>   "The department considers these to be serious incidents that
affect quality of life in the city," said LAPD spokesman Jack
Richter.</TE>
<TE>   After five slayings in South Los Angeles on the weekend of Nov. 9,
Bratton announced he would beef up the police presence in
South-Central, in cooperation with other federal, state and local
police agencies, as well as Metropolitan Division officers.</TE>
<TE>   But Bratton warned that police abuse, racism or disrespect for
civil liberties would not be tolerated.</TE>
<TE>   On Saturday, Officer Tommy Thompson shot a suspect for the third
time in his 6-year LAPD career. Thompson and a partner told
investigators that they had stopped suspected car thieves at 52nd
Place and 52nd Street. Thompson told investigators that the driver
tried to run him over, and he fired his weapon.</TE>
<TE>   The car crashed into a tree, killing two passengers, both
juveniles. The juveniles, who had been shot in the knee and the hand,
died as a result of the crash, police said.</TE>
<TE>   It is not the first time Thompson has cited the fear of being hit
by a car after discharging a firearm. In May 1999, he fired a shotgun
at a car that a 16-year-old was driving at him. The juvenile was not
injured.</TE>
<TE>   Thompson shot a suspect in the neck in 2000 after his partner
warned that he had lost control of his gun.</TE>
<TE>   Both the 1999 and 2000 shootings were found to be justified by
then-Chief Bernard C. Parks.</TE>
<TE>   In a second officer-involved shooting, at 7 p.m. Friday, Officers
Kimberly De Losh and James McCarthy shot and killed a man in
Wilmington after he allegedly rammed his truck into their police car
several times.</TE>
<TE>   Two hours later, Officers Don Byeon and Timothy Kim, two veteran
officers, shot a man running from a carport where another man had
been shot. Both men were seriously wounded.</TE>
<TE>   In the fourth case, police exchanged gunfire with unknown
assailants at 4 a.m. Saturday near Broadway and 108th Street. No
injuries were reported.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, authorities said, LAPD Officer Todd Bogart fatally shot
an unarmed car-theft suspect Sunday afternoon.</TE>
<TE>   Bogart and a partner had stopped a stolen car on Wall Street when
the driver backed up toward the officers' car and refused to stop.</TE>
<TE>   Among those who were slain over the weekend was John Henry Smith,
33, who was shot after he denied a man entry into a rave party in the
6000 block of South Broadway Avenue. The gunman shot the security
guard once in the face. Smith died at King-Drew Medical Center.</TE>
<TE>   Also fatally shot was Moreno Eliseo Rodriguez, who police believe
was ambushed early Sunday as he left his car outside his home in the
1600 block of West 204th Street.</TE>
<TE>   An unidentified 30-year-old man lost his life Saturday after he
tried to evade an attacker. He was stabbed with a steak knife about 4
p.m in the 600 block of South San Julian Street. Police believe the
victim and assailant had fought with their fists.</TE>
<TE>   Police said Willie Yee Alfonso, 27, was gunned down in the 500
block of North Wilton Place in a gang-related attack on a Hollywood
street Sunday morning as he walked with friends not far from his
home.</TE>
<TE>   About 6:30 p.m. Sunday, a man stabbed in the chest was dumped from
a vehicle at the Humphrey Medical Center in the 5800 block of South
Main Street.</TE>
<TE>   As the body was being dumped, three men were shot, one fatally, in
the Jefferson Park area, police said.</TE>
<TE>   At about 2:30 p.m. Monday, two men were shot to death in an alley
in the 1300 block of 13th Street in San Pedro. Police said they were
searching for three people who fled in a burgundy sport utility
vehicle.</TE>
<TE>   At 8 p.m, a man was shot in the head in the 700 block of North
Kingsley Drive in Hollywood. He ran a few blocks, collapsed and died,
authorities said. Police said the shooter, a man, was in a red Toyota
driven by a woman.</TE>

<HD>Vernon Scott, 79; Columnist on Hollywood</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Vernon Scott, who covered Hollywood for more than five decades for
United Press International, died Monday at Barlow Respiratory
Hospital in Los Angeles after two cardiac arrests. He was 79.</LD>
<LD>   The veteran entertainment reporter, who counted many top movie and
television stars among his friends, had been hospitalized since Oct.
18 with pancreatitis. He was interviewing celebrities and writing
about them until he fell ill.</LD>
<LD>   Scott had been a daily Hollywood columnist for UPI for 52 years
and offered a radio version of his interviews on the UPI Radio
Network for 12 years.</LD>
<TE>   He also covered political conventions and other national news
stories.</TE>
<TE>   "Vernon was a great movie fan and was always honest in his
reporting," actor Kirk Douglas said on hearing of Scott's death.
Scott was one of the first Hollywood reporters to interview Douglas
at the beginning of the actor's movie career.</TE>
<TE>   Bob Thomas, the veteran AP entertainment reporter who worked side
by side with Scott for more than five decades, said: "Vernon was
delightful company on the many, many stories we covered together --
and a tough, tough competitor, scooping me as many times as I scooped
him." He said Scott "had no enemies in the Hollywood community"
because he "quoted people correctly and didn't go in for the low
blows."</TE>
<TE>   Among the many celebrities Scott interviewed was Marilyn Monroe,
of whom he wrote: "She is every man's dream of the kind of woman he'd
like to spend the rest of his life with on a deserted island."</TE>
<TE>   Scott said that, when he told Monroe this, during an interview at
the Beverly Hills Hotel, she complained that the right men didn't
call her, and that when, occasionally, a nice one did call and they
hit it off, the man would be so intimidated that he couldn't perform
in bed. Scott said that when he started laughing at this, Monroe
pounded on him and said, "It's not funny!"</TE>
<TE>   He said Monroe "was one of my favorites because she knew why she
was sitting down with us and she came prepared to give you quotes and
to help you do your job. Of course it was self-promoting, but she
cared enough to go to that trouble."</TE>
<TE>   In old Hollywood, Scott told the Daily News of Los Angeles in
1997, even the "shy guys" like Jimmy Stewart, Gary Cooper and Fred
Astaire knew that publicity was important to the success of their
careers and the success of their pictures, so they cooperated on that
basis.</TE>
<TE>   "When they were under contract, if you wanted to talk to Errol
Flynn and he said 'no,' you called up Jack Warner. And he would take
my call, you'd tell him what happened, he'd yell, 'What?' and five
minutes later you had an interview with Errol Flynn."</TE>
<TE>   Scott delighted in telling the story of Bette Davis slapping his
face.</TE>
<TE>   It followed a write-up of Davis and Joan Crawford on the set of
"Whatever Happened to Baby Jane?," filmed in 1961.</TE>
<TE>   "I'd known them both over the years," he said. "And I was just
trying to be pleasant and said, 'It must be great for two great
actresses like you to work together for the first time.' And Joan
smiled and Bette just kind of glared at me."</TE>
<TE>   After the story appeared about a week later, Davis called him and
invited him over for lunch. He told her it was too soon for another
story, but she said, "This is personal."</TE>
<TE>   "So I went up to Bel-Air, where she had a little brick cottage and
I rang the doorbell. She answered and I said, 'Hi Bette, how are
you?' And whack! She slapped me right in the face! I said, 'Jesus,
what was that for?' And she said, 'You know damn well what it's for!'
She was going to slap me again, and I had to hold her hands to stop
her. I wasn't even in the house yet.</TE>
<TE>   "I said, 'Bette, what's this all about?' She said, 'How dare you!'
And I said, 'How dare I what?' 'How dare you compare me in the same
breath with Joan Crawford. She's no actress!'</TE>
<TE>   "And so I started laughing, and then she started to see the humor
in it, I guess, and she started laughing, too. So then she did that
nervous, lighting-a-cigarette Bette Davis thing and kind of growled,
'Well, I did fix some lunch.' So it was all right after that. But did
that ever sting! She really belted me."</TE>
<TE>   But he said that he enjoyed his work.</TE>
<TE>   "It's the best job you can get, in my mind. I mean, what's wrong
with having lunch with Marilyn Monroe?"</TE>
<TE>   Scott graduated from USC and served in World War II and the Korean
War. He is survived by a son, Vernon Scott IV, and a daughter,
Ashley. His marriage to artist Jane Wooster-Scott, as well as two
other marriages, ended in divorce.</TE>
