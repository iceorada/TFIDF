<HD>Accounting: It's a Brave New World</HD>
<DH>The profession's image has gone from Walter Mitty to Mata
Hari, deserved or not.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>REED JOHNSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>One used to play professional soccer. Another wrote an eyewitness
account of the fall of the Berlin Wall. A third got a big surprise
when an inventory of "frozen" lobsters began scuttling away before he
could count them.</LD>
<LD>   Who are these madcap free spirits, these wild and crazy bohemians,
these American fools? The cast of "Survivor"? The members of some
High Sierras cult? Nope, they're all ... accountants. As in "green
eyeshade." As in "No. 2 pencil preferred." As in--dramatic
pause--"Arthur Andersen."</LD>
<LD>   They're living symbols of a profession changing so fast that even
some lifelong members say they can barely recognize it. A profession
once dominated by stern Anglo-Scotsmen who saw themselves as
capitalism's conscience but whose latter-day disciples are being
publicly flogged as symbols of shoddy morality and '90s-style
"corporate greed." A profession whose recent fall from grace has
bestowed a wealth of material on editorial cartoonists and talk-radio
hosts but offers little cause for levity to its daily practitioners.</LD>
<TE>   As David Albrecht can testify. A few days ago, a journalist phoned
up the Ohio accounting professor to ask if he'd heard any good
accounting jokes lately. You know, ha-ha, like the one President Bush
told last week about Saddam Hussein finally agreeing to weapons
inspections. "The bad news is that he wants Arthur Andersen to do
it," America's mirthful Commander-in-Chief quipped.</TE>
<TE>   Albrecht, who teaches at Bowling Green State University, was not
amused. "There aren't any jokes about accounting," he told the
reporter. "Accounting is serious business."</TE>
<TE>   Maybe. But that hasn't silenced the ridicule and second-guessing
that now surround Andersen, the venerable Chicago accounting firm
that has emerged as a central player in the mushrooming Enron Corp.
scandal. Once a model of pinstriped propriety, Andersen has admitted
to shredding thousands of documents relating to its audit of Enron,
the Houston-based energy company that collapsed in bankruptcy last
December. Two weeks ago, in a carefully choreographed anticlimax, a
tight-lipped former Andersen auditor, David B. Duncan, took the Fifth
Amendment rather than discuss his alleged role in the debacle.</TE>
<TE>   Accountants, in sum, seem in danger of blundering into that fiery
abyss reserved for politicians, lawyers, doctors, journalists, cops,
priests, pro athletes and other formerly revered occupations brought
low. Some say that the profession has been wandering off-track ever
since accounting mega-firms like Andersen, one of the so-called Big
5, began reaping big profits by offering clients sophisticated
business advice instead of just honest bookkeeping.</TE>
<TE>   "Maybe an analogy is to the religious scandals of a few years
ago," says Bill Cummings, an accounting professor at Northern
Illinois University and past president of the American Accounting
Assn.'s Midwest region. "Jim Bakker and Jimmy Swaggart were found [to
be] raising all sorts of money on false pretenses. I don't think the
TV religions have ever recovered from that."</TE>
<TE>   To repeat the question: Who are these people long perceived as
monastic pencil pushers with unfashionable eyewear and fluorescent
tans? Whose holy text is a 4-inch-thick manual with the racy title
"Generally Accepted Accounting Principles?" Whose professional roots
date back to ancient Babylon and Greece, where the world's earliest
math whizzes carefully recorded tributary offerings to the gods?
("Let's see, now, that'll be 200 head of goat, 50 slaves and 500
drachma of olives, minus the dozen sacrificial virgins you guys still
owe us.")</TE>
<TE>   More perplexing: How did a line of work synonymous with terminal
dullness suddenly land a starring role on "Hardball With Chris
Matthews"?</TE>
<TE>   Trying to Shake</TE>
<TE>   the Dull Image</TE>
<TE>   If things don't seem to add up in the field of accounting lately,
maybe it's because we're finally seeing that the human calculators
are a lot more human than we imagined. And their work is a lot more
complicated and subtle than its humdrum image suggests. Even the
California Society of CPAs concedes it's been tough in the last
decade to lure rising young stars away from dot.coms and investment
banking. A recent article in its youth-oriented Quest magazine
acknowledged the perception that the accounting biz is to
heart-pounding adventure what the movie biz is to sincerity.</TE>
<TE>   "What could be more unexciting than filling out IRS forms all day
long," the article asks in a sporting attempt at
reverse-psychologizing, "or poring over a company's books to make
sure its debits and credits balance?" The article then ticks off a
number of scintillating careers that began in accounting: An FBI
agent who tracks down drug smugglers, an environmental consultant
helping businesses meet governmental regulations, a financial advisor
to movie stars and sports legends.</TE>
<TE>   Since most of us equate accounting with February weekends spent
poring over receipts and writing fat checks to Uncle Sam, we may
prefer not to think about it much. But if we did, accountants say,
we'd be surprised.</TE>
<TE>   "I say I'm an accountant and I see peoples' eyes glaze over. And
yet my work is very interesting. It's a little like being a
detective," says Susan Slater, vice president of finance for A Place
Called Home, a South-Central L.A. charity. As evidence, Slater cites
a few past assignments from her previous life, when she specialized
in fraud- and litigation-related cases.</TE>
<TE>   "I've gone into Mexico to count inventory in Spanish. I've taken
inventories in food lockers--it's very interesting what you see. I've
counted pipes in dusty fields, counted cash on the midnight shift in
casinos."</TE>
<TE>   Yes, her job is stressful and demanding, Slater says, especially
during the current audit/tax season. "It's almost like being a doctor
without the emergency requirement," she observes. "This is more of a
grim slog all the time. And yet accountants usually love their
profession. We're good at it, and we like to think we have a good
sense of humor, although others might not get the joke."</TE>
<TE>   Many of today's accountants, it appears, are outgoing, highly
educated people like Slater and Tony Teng, an affable 42-year-old
formerly with Arthur Andersen who now teaches accounting information
systems at Cal State Long Beach. Teng still gets a chuckle
remembering the time he was sent to count lobsters in a seafood
restaurant's refrigerator. He thought the beasts were dead when he
laid them out neatly on the kitchen floor for inspection--one, two,
three. Then they started crawling away under the food preparation
tables. Seems they're weren't stiffs, only temporarily stiffened.</TE>
<TE>   "The stereotype of a boring accountant is what you see in the
movies and what you see in the media," Teng insists. "There are
plenty of accountants that bungee jump or have exciting lives."</TE>
<TE>   More than tallying endless rows of numbers, accounts say, their
trade demands iron-clad scruples, an independent mind-set and the
ability to create order out of chaotic clumps of data. It requires
holding clients' hands when necessary and making them face up to
reality when their pie-in-the-sky financial projections crash landed.</TE>
<TE>   "People are very emotional about money," says Slater. "So it's a
bit, I suppose, like being in the diplomatic corps. You have to go in
and talk to a very upset person who knows he or she is being
investigated and may or not be telling the truth. Sometimes the
yelling is the most informative part."</TE>
<TE>   Adds Curt Olsen, a spokesman for the California Society of
Certified Public Accountants: "One of the things we're always trying
to counteract is the image of the bean counter. The fact is, CPAs
need to have high personal skills because they're dealing with
psychology."</TE>
<TE>   And with computers, you don't even need to be that good at math
anymore. "I have a lot of friends who are accountants, and we're
always trying to figure out who's going to divide up the tab," says
Cindy Holdorff, a partner with the Sherman Oaks firm of White,
Zuckerman, Warsavsky, Luna &amp; Wolf.</TE>
<TE>   Even Accountants</TE>
<TE>   Have an Exciting Streak</TE>
<TE>   Pop culture generally has viewed accountants in one of two ways:
either as milquetoast Walter Mittys, like the Jack Lemmon character
in Billy Wilder's "The Apartment," a human doormat who lets his
bosses use his Manhattan digs for their extramarital trysts, or as
smarmy but lovable con men like the Mob bookkeeper played by Charles
Grodin in the 1988 film "Midnight Run."</TE>
<TE>   But with the explosion of white-collar crime in America, a third
typology has emerged in the field of "actuarial science": the nervy
practitioners of "forensic accounting," which one Canadian journal
has pronounced the profession's "sexiest branch." Like bloodhounds in
pursuit of quarry, forensic accountants sniff out missing-money
trails and dig up fraud. Frequently drawn from the ranks of computer
specialists and ex-cops, they ask tough questions, serve as expert
witnesses and occasionally find themselves in the middle of
international subterfuge. Since the Sept. 11 attacks, forensic
accountants have been recruited to help track the money flow from
underground terrorist cells in the United States and Europe back to
their overseas sponsors.</TE>
<TE>   From Bob Cratchit to James Bond, with a nod to Woodward and
Bernstein, modern accounting has certainly come a long way. Yet some
believe the business started losing its bearings precisely when it
got, ah, sexy. Trustworthiness, not glamour or adrenaline rush, had
always been accounting's calling card. For decades the accountant's
green eyeshade was the equivalent of the neighborhood beat
patrolman's badge, the country doctor's little black bag.</TE>
<TE>   "An important and severe profession" was how one Victorian-era
Scotsman approvingly described his vocation. Most 19th century number
crunchers saw themselves as enlightened defenders of the free-market
faith, a bulwark against entrepreneurial excess. "They were deeply
religious people, almost all of them, and they almost felt it was
like a calling from God to protect the public interest," says
professor Cummings.</TE>
<TE>   The discipline's moral tenets, in fact, had been carefully mapped
out as early as 1494 by the Franciscan friar Luca Pacioli, in his
seminal treatise, "Somma de Aritmetica, Geometria, Proportioni et
Proportionalita (Everything About Arithmetic, Geometry and
Proportion)." Professional accounting came relatively late to the
United States, where there were only 300 CPAs in 1900. But after the
1929 stock market crash, the Securities and Exchange Commission
tightened the screws on publicly held companies, forcing them to hire
accountants to prove they were staying out of the red ink.
Accountants earned widespread trust and respect with their civilized
ethics code, including no splashy advertising or poaching each
others' clients.</TE>
<TE>   So what happened? In a nutshell, starting in the late 1970s, the
federal government began removing many competitive restraints on the
industry, says Lynn Turner, former chief accountant of the Securities
and Exchange Commission and now head of the Center for Quality
Financial Reporting at Colorado State University. Rather than its old
style, which was "very much like an English gentlemen's club," Turner
says, the profession grew entrepreneurial and aggressive.</TE>
<TE>   That change cut several ways. Spurning decades-old relationships,
some Fortune 500 firms began playing the Big 5 accountants--Andersen,
PricewaterhouseCoopers, Ernst &amp; Young, KPMG and Deloitte &amp;
Touche--off each other, awarding their business to the lowest bidder.
Yet auditing fees still soared, to an average of $9 million among
blue-chip clients. So did insurance costs due to fraud-related
lawsuits.</TE>
<TE>   Eager to boost profits, big firms expanded their menu of
"consulting" and "management advisory" services to clients. Top
business schools began cranking out more computer specialists and
financial planners than nuts-and-bolts mathematicians. Gradually,
experts contend, the profession's rigidly self-enforced codes of do's
and don'ts began to slip. Objectivity was compromised as big
accounting firms began serving as corporate confidantes rather than
overseers. Some believe those contradictions may lie at the heart of
the Andersen-Enron troubles.</TE>
<TE>   "The CPAs in the past, they weren't trying to sell you a used
car," Turner says. "They were saying, 'There's the options you have,
pick one, and I'm going to give you my unbiased viewpoint.' It is
very easy to lose that trust. It is extremely difficult to rebuild
it."</TE>
<TE>   What comes next? Some predict full-scale federal government
intervention and a slew of new regulations. Others say the industry
must simply do a better job of policing itself. Who knows? Now that
accountants are searching their hearts and baring their souls in
public, professor Cummings thinks the profession at last could be
ready for prime time. "You had 'L.A. Law,' and of course 'The
Practice,'" he says. "Now we need 'Chicago CPAs.' Maybe now the
public would buy that."</TE>

<AU>SCOTT HARRIS</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL>FREMONT, Calif.</DL>
<LD>A watercolor of misery serves as the cover of Volume 1, Issue 1.
Before a ruined cityscape sits a woman shrouded in a mud-brown burka,
a crying infant on her lap. The child's head is swathed in bandages
stained in red.</LD>
<LD>   The image was painted by Ustad Youssef Kohzad, Afghanistan's
former cultural minister and a refugee since 1992. It has its echo on
Page 4 in a poem by Zalmai Herman, an Afghan expatriate living in
Sweden:</LD>
<LD>   ... Like the women of Kabul behind walls</LD>
<TE>   Like the children with families--upon the red snow</TE>
<TE>   I feel frustrated and humiliated for not being able to do a thing</TE>
<TE>   The new quarterly Afghana Journal--22 glossy pages of art, essays,
short stories, memoirs and poems--is a response to such emotions, and
the triumph of an enterprising 18-year-old journalist named Mizgon
Zahir. Her mission is summed up in the magazine's slogan: "unveiling
Afghan Americans."</TE>
<TE>   With about 150,000 Afghans estimated to be living in the U.S.--the
largest concentration in the San Francisco Bay Area--the community's
younger generation has struggled to find its identity, pulled between
their parents' conservative Islam and the opportunities within
America's relatively liberal, multicultural mainstream.</TE>
<TE>   Zahir, born in the United States to parents who departed their
homeland during the Soviet invasion, knew well about the identity
crisis among Afghans living in diaspora, among her peers and within
herself. One recent day, sitting among friends and colleagues at the
low tables inside a restaurant in Fremont's tiny Little Kabul--"a
hate-free community," according to a few red, white and blue
posters--Mizgon and her 27-year-old sister, Giti Zahir, recall their
conversation after watching the documentary "Kandahar."</TE>
<TE>   "I was saying I want to go back to Afghanistan," says Mizgon, a
freshman at  Cal State Hayward. "Then I said, oops, I can't go back,
because I've never been there."</TE>
<TE>   Giti, however, remembers how a smuggler guided a group including
herself and her mother on the long, open truck ride through remote
mountain passes to the Pakistan border. Afghan guards halted them for
two days but eventually relented when an uncle persuaded them that
Giti's mother was ill and in need of treatment in Pakistan. Once they
made it to Peshawar, they set out to join Giti's father, a government
minister who had already managed to leave the country.</TE>
<TE>   Giti, a psychotherapist who works in student health services at
Stanford University, says immigrants such as herself, who remember
their homeland from childhood, tend to be more comfortable moving
between the conservative Islamic traditions at home and the liberal
culture of American youth.</TE>
<TE>   "I relate more to my parents on a cultural level. My mom and I
went through that journey together." Because of that, "you feel an
obligation to fulfill their dreams."</TE>
<TE>   Afghans born here are more apt to clash with their parents'
values. It is not unusual, for example, for Afghan girls to keep a
secret stash of makeup at school. Whatever dating may occur is
typically done on the sly, or perhaps with the willful ignorance of
parents. Protecting the family's reputation is of paramount concern.</TE>
<TE>   Though Zahir is the youngest person in the staff box, she found
support among youthful compatriots: Farhad Azad is the 26-year-old
creator of afghanmagazine.com, a Web site dedicated to Afghan arts
and culture; David Sahar, a 28-year-old surgical resident at UC San
Francisco Medical Center, maintains an Afghan Web service; Ghezal
Omar, a 22-year-old film student, has made a documentary called
"Afghan X," in which she interviews Zahir and five other young
Afghans in America about their perspective on the Sept. 11 terror and
its aftermath.</TE>
<TE>   Their Americanized generation, regardless of how well they
remember--if at all--the old country, share a perspective that may
help rebuild Afghanistan, they say. Young Afghan expatriates expect
women to take a more assertive role in society. And young Afghans in
America, they say, don't recognize the ethnic and tribal conflicts
that have riven Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   Omar, for example, has pale skin and green eyes, traits common to
the northern Tajiks. Zahir has the darker complexion and brown eyes
common to the Pushtuns in the south. But the two think of themselves
as Afghans first and foremost. "To be honest, I didn't really know
what a Pushtun and a Tajik was until Sept. 11 and this whole thing
erupted," Omar says. Now she understands her father is Tajik, her
mother Pushtun.</TE>
<TE>   During his recent visit to Washington, Hamid Karzai, Afghanistan's
interim prime minister, urged young Afghans in America to help
rebuild their homeland. These were encouraging words to the Afghana
Journal crowd. When the Bay Area's Afghan community selected a
delegation of 10 leaders to meet Karzai, only elders were chosen. As
Sahar expressed frustration that young leaders had been ignored,
Zahir took notes. This might be a good story idea, she says, for the
magazine's spring issue.</TE>
<TE>   Zahir embraced her native culture with the assertiveness of an
American woman. At age 13, she was host of a youth program on a
pioneering Afghan community radio broadcast, an endeavor that
required her to adapt the formal Dari she spoke at home to the more
colloquial dialect of Farsi. "It was like jumping in a river and
learning to swim," she says. She wrote articles for Afghan-oriented
Web sites, sometimes using a pen name.</TE>
<TE>   She later contributed to Youth Outlook, or YO, a teen-oriented Bay
Area monthly published by the nonprofit Pacific News Service. YO,
says Pacific editor Sandy Close, was created as a forum for "kids who
didn't have voices" in mainstream media, including many children of
refugees. After learning that the news service had successfully
incubated youth publications for other immigrant communities, Zahir
began assembling editorial content last summer for Afghana Journal's
premiere issue, before funding was even assured. If no money were to
come through for publishing, Zahir figured, she'd make it a low-cost
online operation.</TE>
<TE>   Soon after the attacks, the Tides Foundation offered grants to
promote understanding of the conflict. Close secured a grant of
$5,000 to fund Afghana Journal's initial run of 2,000 copies on
high-quality paper stock and provide modest commissions to the staff.
Zahir urgently assembled new content to reflect the latest
heart-rending reality.</TE>
<TE>   Close considers the creation of Afghana Journal an act of moral
courage. "What Mizgon has done is remarkable, and at the same time
living in a very traditional community with a lot of obligation to
her family. She has just stepped up to give a visibility and a voice
to all these people, to give a sense of what it means to be a young
Afghan in America today. I mean, can you imagine a more complex
dilemma?"</TE>
<TE>   Sahar struggles to describe his anguish. As U.S. and allied forces
bombed his beloved homeland--a country that has survived a generation
of warfare--he was besieged by an onslaught of hate e-mail on the
Afghan community Web site. "If you want to know how Afghans feel in
America," Sahar says, waving the Journal, "this is it."</TE>
<TE>   He flips the pages and reads a passage from an essay titled "A
Letter From 'The Enemy'" by Nadia Alit Maiwandi, a Portland, Ore.,
writer whose parents immigrated to the United States in 1966:</TE>
<TE>   "Suddenly I am not a cute little novelty anymore, but the enemy.
Me: The first with all the rock albums and the annoying Valley-girl
vernacular? ... "The anti-Middle Eastern sentiment of the past
[during the Iran hostage crisis and the Gulf War] pales in comparison
of that today. Growing up, I was called many names ... and I knew
some kids deliberately did not befriend me, for I was the enemy."</TE>
<TE>   In another essay, Maiwandi takes the American media to task for
what she considers its simplistic bias. She pointedly notes that this
is the same media that had largely ignored Afghanistan in recent
years while it was obsessed with such newsmakers as Monica Lewinsky.</TE>
<TE>   "It is easy to hate when you have little knowledge of your
enemy--when the people you wish dead are faceless, evil 'barbaric
terrorists.' But slowly, we began to be shown in an empathetic light
as the world saw for the first time the atrocities inflicted on the
Afghan people. With this new information ... America began to replace
'Why do they hate us?' with long overdue questions like, 'What can we
do to help?'"</TE>
<TE>   An essay by Rameen Moshref, who says his family urged him to stay
silent, passionately argues that anti-war sentiments among Muslim
Americans are an act of patriotism: "If we say we are not for war, we
are seen as unpatriotic or siding with the terrorists, having
sympathies with them.</TE>
<TE>   "Didn't we become Americans, with full rights and privileges, when
we were naturalized as citizens? Does patriotism mean supporting mass
killing of innocent people just because they happen to be in the same
country that houses a network of terrorists? Will spilling innocent
civilian blood avenge those innocent lives lost in the World Trade
Center? Will their martyred souls rest in peace after the massacre of
starved women and children? Is it not patriotism to try to prevent
American hands from being stained by innocent blood?"</TE>
<TE>   Mizgon Zahir now finds herself wearing other hats, developing a
circulation and advertising strategy to make Afghana Journal support
itself. (For now, it can be ordered at www.afghanajournal.com.) She
shows the Journal's first issue to Wahid Andesha, owner of the Salang
Pass restaurant. He boasts that he has been interviewed by the media
27 times since Sept. 11. Little Kabul is that small.</TE>
<TE>   Soon Zahir works out an agreement. Andesha says he'll display a
copy and sell it from behind the counter. Andesha suggests that with
a cover price of $5, Afghans won't buy the magazine, but maybe
"generous Americans" will.</TE>
<TE>   Zahir shifts from English to Farsi to quote ad rates. The
restaurateur says he'll go for a half-page, and Zahir beams. It's her
first sale.</TE>

<LD>Actress Janet Leigh is sitting in her home office high above Sunset
Boulevard. On her desk: a yellow legal note pad and several No. 3
pencils, the tools of her other trade, as an author.</LD>
<LD>   Dressed in pink slacks and a pink sweater, with understated gold
jewelry, Leigh curls up in a chair and talks.</LD>
<LD>   She's a woman of a few thousand words, as her publishing career
will attest. Her output includes an autobiography, a book about the
making of "Psycho" and two novels.</LD>
<TE>   "It's surprising ... that I'm still around," says Leigh, who's 75.
"Longevity doesn't seem to be one of the perks of this business."</TE>
<TE>   But she seems to have found it, in five decades of acting that
include such highlights as "Touch of Evil," "The Manchurian
Candidate" and, of course, that famous shower scene.</TE>
<TE>   For nearly four of those decades, she has been married to
stockbroker Robert Brandt, a third marriage for both. "It didn't work
marrying for life, did it?" Leigh said. "So, we'll do it one day at a
time."</TE>
<TE>   Her new novel, "The Dream Factory" (Mira) begins at the deathbed
of Eve Handel, a character loosely based on Leigh's mentor, a drama
coach at MGM. The book then looks back over Handel's life in 1950s
Hollywood.</TE>
<TE>   "The dream factory of that time was much simpler," Leigh says,
under the unsmiling gaze of Alfred Hitchcock, who looks down from a
black-and-white photo she received from daughter Jamie Lee Curtis.
"As media outlets grew, everything became so complicated. It's like
the Cookie Monster. ... " She hesitates. "No, wait, not the Cookie
Monster." Leigh jumps up and grabs the phone to ask her assistant:
"What's that play, with the man-eating plant? Yes, that's it. 'The
Little Shop of Horrors.'"</TE>
<TE>   She returns to her chair, satisfied.</TE>
<TE>   "It's like that play. Today, there's not enough product to feed
[the monster]." And, she adds, "It's hard to make something which has
a single vision." Unless, she added, "you're Steven Spielberg"--or a
writer.</TE>
<TE>   In that role, Leigh says, "You do manufacture dreams, but in order
to dream, you need to have a springboard which is the facts"--like
quotes from her manicurist's daughter, whom she credits as
inspiration for a character. "It gives it that touch of reality, and
I think that's quite important ... truth with fiction."</TE>
<TE>   Brown Takes</TE>
<TE>   the Stand</TE>
<TE>   Wearing an electric-blue suit and his trademark coiffure, the
Godfather of Soul strode into Los Angeles County Superior Court on
Tuesday morning trailed by his bodyguard, his attorney and a phalanx
of reporters. James Brown was in court to testify on his own behalf
in a $2-million sexual harassment suit filed by Lisa Ross Agbalaya,
who managed Brown's West Coast operations.</TE>
<TE>   Agbalaya has testified that from July 1999 to February 2000, Brown
repeatedly made unwanted sexual advances while she worked for New
James Brown Enterprises Inc. Agbalaya, who is married with two
children, claims she refused Brown's overtures and was fired for it.
Brown denies Agbalaya's accusations and claims he fired her because
financial troubles forced him to close his West Coast office. "I just
felt bad because the office wasn't making money," said Brown.</TE>
<TE>   Agbalaya claims in the suit that during a visit to Brown's
Augusta, Ga., home in summer 1999, Brown, now 68, cornered her in his
den, pulled her toward him, then produced a pair of zebra-print
panties and asked her to slip them on while a dinner of liver and
onions was prepared. It was to be, according to the suit, "a night
... to remember." "I just want to make you feel good," Brown told
Agbalaya, according to the suit.</TE>
<TE>   Early on, Brown spent half an hour on the stand verifying his
signature on a series of legal documents. He shifted uncomfortably
and shook his head in frustration.</TE>
<TE>   "It feels good to clear the record, but I don't understand," Brown
said of the charges during a break. "I was just trying to help
someone. ... I never demeaned anybody."</TE>
<TE>   "The key thing here is the defendant has to be an employer and the
plaintiff has to be an employee,'' said Brown's attorney Debra Opri
after a court session Monday. Agbalaya was "an independent
contractor" for Brown, Opri contends, and therefore, she argues,
Agbalaya can't sue as an employee of his company.</TE>
<TE>   Agbalaya is demanding $2 million for sexual harassment, wrongful
termination and intentional infliction of emotional distress.</TE>
<TE>   Dust storm dust-up</TE>
<TE>   A proposed class-action suit was filed on behalf of "Planet of the
Apes" extras last week, claiming they were exposed to cancer-causing
substances during filming of a dust storm.</TE>
<TE>   During a shoot in the Mojave Desert, the extras, playing apes or
humans, were blasted with 80,000 pounds of dust called Fuller's
Earth, which contains a known carcinogen, according to the complaint
filed in Los Angeles County Superior Court against Fox Entertainment
Group Inc. and Entertainment Partner Service Group Inc.</TE>
<TE>   The Fuller's Earth bags had warning labels that were allegedly
removed, and although the product labels said particle masks should
be worn, no masks were given to the extras, the suit claims.</TE>
<TE>   "If it wasn't [dangerous], why was Tim Burton wearing a respirator
[with] two canisters?" said attorney Neal J. Fialkow, who represents
the plaintiffs. "He wasn't taking any chances."</TE>
<TE>   Fox Entertainment Group would not comment, a spokeswoman said.</TE>
<TE>   Quote/Unquote</TE>
<TE>   "We're the ones who decide what we do and when we do it,"
15-year-old Ashley Olsen tells Connie Chung when asked during an
interview that airs tonight on ABC's "20/20 Downtown" about the power
she and twin Mary-Kate Olsen have in their multinational company.</TE>

<KH>Chris Erskine THE GUY CHRONICLES</KH>
<HD>In Praise of Winter Weekends and Football</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Chris Erskine</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>We begin our winter weekend with a movie, "A Beautiful Mind," a good
film, though not spectacular. If this is the best thing out of
Hollywood this year, then your home movies may be Oscar contenders.</LD>
<LD>   "Let me get this straight," I say on the way home. "She slept with
her professor?"</LD>
<LD>   "Things were different back then," my wife says.</LD>
<TE>   "Yeah," I say. "Coeds were tramps."</TE>
<TE>   "She married him and stuck by him," my wife says, as if that's
some sort of virtue.</TE>
<TE>   On the couch at home, we watch a pre-Super Bowl salute, two days
before the game, featuring a young entertainer by the name of Ja
Rule.</TE>
<TE>   Like a lot of rappers, Mr. Rule sometimes forsakes a nice melody
in favor of a grinding, pulsating rhythm. He also appears to spit
into the microphone. A lot. Needless to say, he's very popular.</TE>
<TE>   "We should form a rap band," I told a friend recently.</TE>
<TE>   "Why?"</TE>
<TE>   "So maybe we'd understand," I say.</TE>
<TE>   Sheryl Crow follows, and frankly she doesn't sound so hot either;
her voice is kind of weak, although she has the advantage of looking
like this cheerleader I knew in college.</TE>
<TE>   My wife and I speculate about why Crow sounds so bad. Could be the
sound system. Or the beery crowd, screaming at her from behind the
stage. But bad this night she is. Needless to say, she's very
popular.</TE>
<TE>   I've come to terms with the fact that, for the rest of eternity,
parents will sit on couches and discuss the poor quality of their
children's favorite performers.</TE>
<TE>   That said, I also believe that when popular culture aims only at
the tastes of 12-year-olds, everyone suffers. Even the 12-year-olds.</TE>
<TE>   "Sting's on next," my wife says.</TE>
<TE>   "Thank God," I say.</TE>
<TE>   It's February already, a time of Super Bowls and important
auditions.</TE>
<TE>   At the ball field, the girls line up like a chorus line.</TE>
<TE>   "My name's Olivia," a fifth-grader says.</TE>
<TE>   "Olivia, have you ever played softball before?" one of the coaches
asks.</TE>
<TE>   "This is my first year," Olivia says pleasantly enough.</TE>
<TE>   They are among the finest things about Southern California, these
Saturdays in February that are toasty enough for baseball, yet with
snow lacing the nearby San Gabriels. In a town full of set designers,
I dare you to find a more breathtaking backdrop.</TE>
<TE>   And in a town of auditions, I dare you to find one more riveting
than this one: 70 girls trying out in front of a handful of coaches,
some of them outside for the first time since Halloween.</TE>
<TE>   "There's a lot of talent out here," I tell Bill, my assistant
coach.</TE>
<TE>   "Where?" asks Coach Bill.</TE>
<TE>   "Everywhere," I say.</TE>
<TE>   "Oh, now I see," he says.</TE>
<TE>   Three at a time, the girls parade before the coaches, who ask them
inane questions like how long they've studied the art of softball and
what position they like to play.</TE>
<TE>   "I like to play shortstop and outfield," a girl tells the coaches.</TE>
<TE>   "You ever pitch?" I ask.</TE>
<TE>   "Aren't you listening?" another coach complains. "She just said
she plays outfield and shortstop."</TE>
<TE>   "So shoot me," I say.</TE>
<TE>   "Yeah, shoot him," Coach Bill urges.</TE>
<TE>   And with that, the three young players trot out to take some
grounders.</TE>
<TE>   Lord, remember trotting out to the infield for the first time each
spring, the sun on your face, your glove smelling like a dead animal
from being in the garage all winter? Me neither. But I'll bet it was
nice.</TE>
<TE>   "That one, she looks like a 3," Coach Bill says, marking his
rating sheet.</TE>
<TE>   "Or a 2?" I say.</TE>
<TE>   "A 2 or a 3," he says.</TE>
<TE>   "How about a 1?" I say.</TE>
<TE>   "I was going to say 1," Coach Bill says.</TE>
<TE>   Coach Bill and I have been coaching together for five years now.
When we talk, it sounds like an old Rowan and Martin routine. I feed
him slow, easy straight lines. He knocks 'em out of the park.</TE>
<TE>   "Coach Bob is looking good out there," I say about our new league
commissioner, a handsome man in a damp T-shirt.</TE>
<TE>   "Implants," Coach Bill says.</TE>
<TE>   We cap the weekend by preparing for something called the Super
Bowl. In grocery stores, customers stock up on food as if the world
is about to end. For many Americans, it's the biggest food orgy of
the year.</TE>
<TE>   Turns out to be a great game, too. You may have heard about it. To
recap: Guy kicks a field goal with seven seconds left. The world goes
nuts, basically.</TE>
<TE>   "What a game," everybody at our friends' Super Bowl party says.</TE>
<TE>   "Who could've predicted this?" says my buddy Mark.</TE>
<TE>   As always, the person to win the Super Bowl pool is the one who
knows the least about football. In fact, our winner, Christine,
reportedly left the Super Bowl party to go next door and take a
bubble bath. When she learns she's won the pool, she gets out of the
bubble bath and returns to claim her prize. How some network missed
covering this, I'll never know.</TE>
<TE>   "Who was playing again?" Christine asks when she collects her 150
bucks.</TE>
<TE>   See? My theory is that in 36 Super Bowls, no one who knows
anything about football has ever won the pot. It's virtually
unprovable, but so are most of my theories.</TE>
<TE>   "It's Summerall's last game," someone says of the veteran
play-by-play announcer.</TE>
<TE>   Jack Buck. Ray Scott. Keith Jackson. Sports announcers don't peak
till they're at least 60 and can remain first rate another decade or
two.</TE>
<TE>   Vin Scully. Chick Hearn. Harry Caray. So they make a few more
mistakes when they hit 70. Who cares? They're comfortable as a pair
of mink galoshes.</TE>
<TE>   On Super Bowl Sunday, the playing field may belong to the young
and swift. Let the microphones belong to the wise and the mature.</TE>
<TE>   And let these winter weekends go on forever.</TE>

<HD>Trip to Emergency Room Bends Rules of the Road</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARY McNAMARA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Within the realm of driving experiences, the trip to the emergency
room has got to be the worst. For most of us, it's as close to
extreme driving--the type that usually requires a helmet and/or
siren--as we're going to get. Which is just fine by me. I recently
raced my 22-month-old daughter to the emergency room after she had
eaten a handful of her grandfather's heart medication, and although
she was bright-eyed and chipper 20 minutes after having her stomach
pumped, I still haven't recovered--from the drive, much less what
happened afterward.</LD>
<LD>   We were visiting my parents in Las Cruces, N.M., and so not only
were we trying to make time in a hesitating, left-pulling rental car,
but we were also peering through the dark for a hospital we'd never
even seen before. I drove--and left my husband to hang over Fiona
anxiously enough to satisfy my vicarious need but not so anxiously
that it would upset her--only because I had a slightly better idea of
where we were going.</LD>
<TE>   When you're driving your child to the emergency room, several odd
things happen. The streets, with their stoplights and dividers, with
their curbs and various symbolic admonishments, stop being streets
and become merely terrain. The other cars undergo a similar
metamorphosis--as if through night goggles or the depths of a video
game, you see vaguely outlined obstacles. I stopped at red lights
only after deciding that I could not afford to lose the time it would
take to explain the situation to the police officer and demand an
escort.</TE>
<TE>   Fear seemed to fog the windshield, and I could not believe the
callousness of those around me. The people pulling into gas stations,
the guy walking out of the KFC, the driver next to me who was
actually singing along to the radio--didn't they realize that life as
we knew it had just been officially suspended and would stay
suspended until the doctor smiled up from his white coat and said
"she'll be just fine"? Didn't they realize that we were headed to the
emergency room?</TE>
<TE>   When you're driving your child to the emergency room, you tend to
think in italics.</TE>
<TE>   I remember as a child making several similar trips, usually with
my father driving and my mother sitting in the back seat applying
pressure through a bloody towel to whichever portion of the body my
brother or I had injured. I remember the terse way they spoke to each
other, the silence that ballooned between the words. At the time it
never occurred to me that whatever had happened could not be fixed.
Eventually, I knew, we would all be heading home again, with a new
set of stitches and a few milkshakes between us. And so trips to the
emergency room were sort of fun, in a highly fraught,
wait-till-we-tell-the-guys way.</TE>
<TE>   Children relish their war wounds. The playground tales of the hand
through the window, the finger cut off by the sled runner and sewn on
again, the blood pouring out of the cut over the eye, are as valuable
and oft-traded a currency as any story from the battlefield or the
delivery room.</TE>
<TE>   But when you're driving your child to the emergency room, you
realize it's never the parents who are telling these stories over and
over again with wide-eyed relish.</TE>
<TE>   Because it is simply impossible that you are sitting behind a
wheel of a car, just like you do every day, checking the rearview,
hitting your turn signals, pumping the brake while your child sits in
the back seat with a belly full of poison. It just cannot be
happening. You took your eyes off her for two minutes, three at the
most and why would she even go into the dark room where the medicine
was kept and how did she open it and is this how your life is going
to turn out, is it going to be ruined forever on this nondescript
night and why doesn't that guy in the truck pick a lane and stay
there so you can just get to the emergency room and endure whatever
it takes to hear the doctor say "She'll be just fine."</TE>
<TE>   When you're driving your child to the emergency room, you realize
that you can never know what impossible situation is unfolding in the
lives of the drivers around you.</TE>
<TE>   Sitting outside the trauma room while the nurses washed Fiona's
insides clean, I found consolation in two things.</TE>
<TE>   When I was a kid, having had your stomach pumped trumped just
about every injury or ailment the other kids could boast about, and
as frantic as the drive over had seemed to me and my husband, Fiona
had slept through the whole thing. And, six hours later, the doctor
pronounced her "just fine."</TE>

<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>An assault is taking place. Not in Afghanistan or Pakistan. But on
our own soil. In our own neighborhoods. At our own front doors. The
soldiers are smallish, often ponytailed, and wear a mean shade of
brown or green. And as with all well-trained warriors, their mission
has been drilled into their brains: "Sell Tagalongs, All Abouts and
Do-Si-Dos until you drop!"</LD>
<LD>   Yes, Girl Scouts are out in full force selling cookies. And, like
you, I dread this time of year. You get hit up at Vons, at your kids'
school, at neighbors' homes. At work, dads and moms do the dirty
work, waylaying you at the water cooler or in the parking garage.</LD>
<LD>   But this year is different. This year, my daughter, Libby, has
become a Brownie. She will be among the soldiers of sugar patrolling
the streets, and I will have to put the squeeze on all my friends and
relatives.</LD>
<TE>   So it was with a heavy heart that I dragged myself to the Brownie
Troop 151 parents' meeting. There, cookie chairwoman Sharon, like any
good commander, laid down the rules of engagement in clear terms:
Each girl was expected to sell a minimum of 100 boxes by the end of
February. As motivation, they would win prizes along the way, ranging
from the piddling--a cookie patch for selling 40 boxes--to the
sublime--frolicking with the dolphins at Sea World for selling a
mind-boggling 1,250.</TE>
<TE>   Each girl wrote her goal on a bulletin board. Most were realistic:
150 boxes, 175, 200. Not my daughter's. Last year the top seller in
our troop had moved 500 boxes. Libby, vowing to beat that amount,
wanted to sell 550.</TE>
<TE>   My heart started pounding. My left eye began to twitch--550? That
was impossible! Why, at the school fund-raiser last fall, we'd barely
been able to sell $30 worth of wrapping paper. And guess who bought
them? Me, because I couldn't bear to ask anyone.</TE>
<TE>   When we got home, I asked Libby what had possessed her to want to
sell so many cookies, hoping to talk her out of it. "I've got big
goals, Mom, and I go after them," she explained. How could you argue
with that? I kept my mouth shut but still prayed she'd come to her
senses. The Girl Scout handout states that part of the purpose of
selling cookies is to help girls develop their goal-setting skills,
but this was ridiculous!</TE>
<TE>   The D-day to begin selling was set--no early sales, please--Scouts
honor. The first day of sales, I went for a morning run. As I was
heading home at a still-early 8:30, I spied a tiny blond creature
striding down the street. Another figure loomed behind her. As I got
closer, their forms became horrifyingly clear: It was a Brownie,
getting an early jump, mother in tow. A block closer to home, I
spotted yet another brown-vested sprite going door to door.</TE>
<TE>   Right then, something happened that I can't quite explain. Maybe
my competitive spirit kicked in. Or my inner Brownie. Or my desire to
support my daughter in whatever she did, whether it was school,
soccer or selling Samoas. Or maybe I just wanted Libby to win that
30-inch stuffed monkey prize she kept talking about.</TE>
<TE>   All I know is that I was seized with the compulsion to rush home
and hustle Libby out the door before all these other Brownies plucked
our neighborhood clean. This was war, and we were going to win.</TE>
<TE>   I raced home but couldn't find my family. They'd walked to the
park. I ran there and gave Libby the news as calmly and succinctly as
possible: "Brownies. On the street. Cookies."</TE>
<TE>   Somehow, in her wisdom of 7 years, Libby understood. "You get a
pen, and I'll get the sign-up sheet," she yelled as we made a beeline
for home. Once inside, she grabbed the sheet and marched out the
door, too impatient to even put on her uniform.</TE>
<TE>   Most neighbors weren't home, but those who were greeted us with
enthusiasm and generosity. Next, we hit my hairdresser's, who was
good for two boxes of Thin Mints. Then, on to my son's baseball
tryouts--24 more boxes snapped up. Next, a quick drive over to our
friend, Mrs. D'Oro, who took seven. By the time we got home an hour
and a half later, Libby had sold 54 boxes.</TE>
<TE>   Already the brands of cookies were becoming a blur. Aloha Chips,
All Abouts, Thin Mints. It didn't matter what people bought. All that
mattered was that they were buying.</TE>
<TE>   We were taking a well-deserved lunch break when the doorbell rang.
There, on our own turf, stood a Brownie who lived in another part of
town. An "enemy" Brownie was invading! After reaching a detente with
the other mother (she bought a box from Libby, I bought one from her
daughter), Libby knew what she had to do: Hit the streets again, this
time with Dad. While she'd been outmaneuvered at a few homes in our
neighborhood that were rightfully hers, she was still able to sell 27
more boxes for a total of 81.</TE>
<TE>   We were joyful, giddy. Heck, we'd almost sold the minimum--and in
just a few hours. As I write, we're resting. But good soldiers never
truly let down their guard. Good soldiers continue to strategize. So
Libby plots. She's combing the school directory, pinpointing families
without girls. She's making a list of easy marks--her grandparents,
Aunt Alexa and Uncle Steve. I'm jotting down people who owe me
favors. And my husband is putting the Girl Scout "pocket" order form
in his briefcase to pass around at work tomorrow.</TE>
<TE>   Only 550 boxes? Why not make it 600?</TE>

<LD>Red-Knobbed Hornbills</LD>
<LD>   Most animals are dependent on their parents for survival when they
are young. But there also are some adult animals that form lifelong
bonds with their mates and depend on each other for survival.</LD>
<LD>   An example is the female hornbill, which relies on her mate for
food when she is nesting, or laying her eggs. This bird will seal
herself in a tree cavity by using mud and other things to build an
adobe-like wall. She leaves a slit big enough for her mate to pass
food to her. For two to three months, the female stays inside the
cavity. Once her chicks hatch, she breaks the wall and leaves to find
food for them. The mother bird helps her chicks reseal the wall so
that the chicks can mature in the cavity for another month before
they join their parents. This unusual nesting habit allows hornbills
to secure themselves to avoid predators when they are most
vulnerable.</LD>
<TE>   The Los Angeles Zoo has two red-knobbed hornbills on exhibit. They
are native to Sulawesi Island in Indonesia. Many hornbill species are
threatened with extinction because of forest destruction throughout
the world. Without the forest, hornbills cannot nest. Ironically,
trees also are dependent on hornbills because these birds spread
seeds that spur the growth of new trees.</TE>
<TE>   Learn more about these fascinating red-knobbed hornbills by
visiting them at the Los Angeles Zoo. Saturday and Sunday the zoo
will hold L.A. Zoo Lovin'--a special Valentine's Day celebration.
Visitors can make Valentine's Day cards to take home, get hearts
painted on their faces, learn about the various sizes of hearts in
animals and enjoy classical music. Learn more about the zoo by
visiting its Web site at www.lazoo.org.</TE>

<LD>"Which Witch?"</LD>
<LD>   by Eva Ibbotson</LD>
<LD>   Arriman the Awful wants to get married. He is a wizard, and
everyone knows the only person a wizard can marry is a witch. So he
holds a contest to see which witch to marry. Poor Arriman, he doesn't
know which witch to choose!</LD>

<TE>   Michael Jordan is considered the best basketball player ever. He
wasn't very good at basketball when he was a kid. He actually liked
to play baseball. But he practiced hard and became very good. He
became the best college player. In the NBA, he was the MVP six times!
He's won two Olympic gold medals. And he has won six championships! I
think Michael Jordan is very interesting to read about if you like
basketball.</TE>

<HD>Meet Venus, Serena Williams</HD>
<DH>Part 3 The story so far: Venus and Serena Williams have
been training to enter major tennis competitions.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GLORIA D. MIKLOWITZ</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Venus turned professional in 1995 at age 15. Her parents required
that she keep up her grades, limited her to two hours of TV a week
and allowed no parties or dates. She didn't play on the tour in 1996
and entered only five events in 1997.</LD>
<LD>   In one of those events she was paired with 15-year-old Serena for
doubles in Palm Beach, Fla. They played against Asa Carlsson of
Sweden and Anne-Gaelle Sidot of France. Venus and Serena, their hair
in white-beaded dreadlocks, drew a standing-room-only crowd and won,
0-6, 6-3, 6-3.</LD>
<LD>   Players are ranked according to their success in various
tournaments. In 1997, Serena beat two of the world's top players,
Monica Seles and Mary Pierce. Both sisters continually improved their
rankings.</LD>
<TE>   The sisters are very close friends. Venus is almost 6 feet 2,
muscular and lithe. Serena is three inches shorter. The sisters enjoy
shopping, kidding around and practicing together. They help each
other by pointing out ways to improve weaknesses. Venus has been
accused of being unfriendly, while Serena is considered outgoing.</TE>
<TE>   Because of their successes in a sport that once was only for rich
white men and women, interest in tennis has grown. Also, financial
rewards have come to them. In 1995, Reebok offered Venus $12 million
to endorse its products. A year later, Reebok introduced sportswear
called "The Venus Williams Collection." In addition, the players have
earned thousands of dollars by winning competitions. They now live on
an estate in Florida with a tennis court.</TE>
<TE>   Venus graduated from high school in 1997 with an A average and
started taking courses at a local college. That year she played so
well that she became the first black woman since Althea Gibson in
1958 to reach the finals of the U.S. Open.</TE>
<TE>   "Something in her head clicked," her mother said. "How not to
rush, how to play the game." She slowed her fast serve, mixed her
shots, learned from each game and won every match. By September 1997,
Venus had taken home more than $426,000 in prize money and was doing
much better in each tournament. Her world ranking jumped from 211 at
the start of 1997 to 7 by June 1998.</TE>
<TE>   Thursday: How long will it take the sisters to reach the top?</TE>
<TE>   This is Gloria D. Miklowitz's 10th biography for the Kids' Reading
Room. Her story will be on The Times' Web site at
www.latimes.comkids.</TE>

<HD>'Green Book' Offers Chapter and Verse on Clean Machines of
2002</HD>

<AU>JOHN O'DELL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The annual "Green Book" guide to environmentally friendly model year
2002 passenger vehicles was released Tuesday, and in a big change
from years past, eight of the dozen top-scoring cars are powered by
conventional gasoline-burning, internal-combustion engines.</LD>
<LD>   Since the first guide was published five years ago, the top of the
list had been populated almost exclusively by electric vehicles,
gasoline-electric hybrids and cars using alternative fuels such as
compressed natural gas.</LD>
<LD>   But improvements in engine and emissions-management technology are
making gasoline-fueled vehicles ever-cleaner, and the "Green Book"
recognizes that, said coauthor John DeCicco, a senior fellow at
Environmental Defense.</LD>
<TE>   DeCicco and coauthor James Kliesch, a transportation analyst with
the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy, bemoan the auto
industry's continuing push for profitable pickup trucks and
sport-utility vehicles--heavyweights that gulp fuel.</TE>
<TE>   Overall, they said, these vehicles have kept the auto market
"headed down the road of environmental harm" because of reduced fuel
economy that increases dependence on foreign oil and contributes to
greenhouse gases that cause global warming.</TE>
<TE>   The book, published by the nonprofit ACEEE, rates cars and trucks
not only according to tailpipe pollution and global-warming emissions
but by pollution from auto factories and refineries as well.</TE>
<TE>   Thus it is that the only zero-emissions vehicle in the top 12 this
year, Toyota's electric-powered RAV4 sport-utility, wound up in third
place after the "Green Guide" authors factored in pollution from the
production of electricity needed to charge the batteries.</TE>
<TE>   The "greenest" car, Honda's Insight hybrid, uses a small gasoline
engine and an electric motor but produces its electricity with an
on-board generator that is cleaner than a stand-alone power plant,
DeCicco said. In second place was Honda's Civic GX, which uses
compressed natural gas to fuel an internal-combustion engine.</TE>
<TE>   The nine others in the top 12 (all with four-cylinder gasoline
engines), in descending order: Toyota Prius hybrid with automatic
transmission; Honda Civic HX, 1.7-liter with manual; Toyota Echo
sedan, 1.5-liter, manual; Nissan Sentra CA, 1.8-liter, automatic;
Honda Civic, 1.7-liter, manual; Mitsubishi Mirage, 1.5-liter, manual;
Toyota Corolla and its Chevrolet Prizm twin, 1.8-liter, manual; and
Saturn SL, 1.9-liter manual.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to singing the praises of the greenest vehicles while
tracing the ups and downs of the auto industry's efforts to clean up
its act, the "Green Book" aims to provide environmentally conscious
shoppers a guide to the best choices in various categories of
transportation.</TE>
<TE>   Thus, while noting that trucks are, by their nature, dirtier than
cars, the book provides truck shoppers with ratings for pickups, SUVs
and minivans and finds that some do pretty well.</TE>
<TE>   The V-6-powered Chevrolet Venture minivan and its Pontiac Montana
and Oldsmobile Silhouette siblings, for example, outscore many large
and mid-size cars. So do the four-cylinder version of Toyota's
full-size Tundra pickup and the six-cylinder version of Ford's F-150
pickup.</TE>
<TE>   "Consumers have planet-friendly options throughout the market,
including trucks and SUVs," DeCicco said.</TE>
<TE>   Along with the summary green scores, ACEEE's "Green Book" details
each model's fuel economy, health-related pollution effects,
global-warming emissions and estimated fuel expenses.</TE>
<TE>   Copies are for sale at many major bookstores or can be ordered
from ACEEE for $8.95, plus $5 for shipping and handling, at (202)
429-8873. The book also can be obtained online at
www.greenercars.com. Although the full-text version must be
purchased, the Internet site provides lists of the dozen meanest and
greenest vehicles, as well as the top-rated vehicles by class, at no
charge.</TE>

<LD>It's show time again.</LD>
<LD>   The world's auto makers fire their big guns in the U.S. at the
Detroit and Los Angeles auto shows in January, but they always save a
little for Chicago--which previews its wares today and Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   Goodies include Kia's new mid-size sport-utility vehicle, a
V-6-powered production model for 2003 that springs from the Sorento
model the South Korean car company introduced in Japan last year. And
Mercury shows the redesigned 2003 Grand Marquis and a new
concept--the five-passenger Marauder convertible--that advances the
production model Marauder muscle car that hits showrooms late this
year.</LD>
<TE>   By virtue of its Midwestern locale, the Chicago show traditionally
is a truck-heavy event.</TE>
<TE>   This year Dodge will unveil the new heavy-duty Ram 2500 and 3500
series pickups, GMC is showing a four-door concept called the Terra4
that builds on the angular "professional truck" styling theme it has
chosen to differentiate itself from Chevrolet, and Nissan unveils the
Frontier "Open Sky," a four-door pickup with a sunroof that lets the
sun shine on occupants in both rows of seats.</TE>

<HD>Volvo's New SUV Plays It Safe</HD>
<DH>The auto maker is counting on a crossover design and a
reputation for sturdiness to stand out in an already crowded field.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN O'DELL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The world doesn't need another sport-utility vehicle, but car
companies have a hard time seeing beyond the competition. And because
Volvo has seen just about everyone else hit the road with a high,
wide and profitable SUV, Sweden's safe-and-sane auto maker soon will
have one too.</LD>
<LD>   It may be one of the last to arrive at the party, but Volvo, a
unit of Ford Motor Co.'s Premier Automotive Group, doesn't intend to
go unnoticed. Playing on its reputation, Volvo will market its XC90
as the safest SUV on the road when it hits showrooms late this year.</LD>
<LD>   Industry analysts say the company stands a decent chance of
success even though it will be entering a market crowded with 54
models and more on the way.</LD>
<TE>   SUV buyers these days tend to think of their purchases as smart
ones from a safety perspective. The cachet of an SUV with Volvo-level
safety components can't hurt.</TE>
<TE>   "Being safe has a lot of selling power," said George Peterson,
president of Tustin-based AutoPacific Inc. "For many, SUVs are
today's minivans and they carry people's most important
possessions--their children. They want them to be as safe as
possible."</TE>
<TE>   But the effectiveness of a safety-based selling campaign--Volvo
also intends to promote the XC90's styling and luxury
appointments--won't be apparent until sales actually begin.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, at least one industry watcher wonders whether
Volvo-ness alone will do the trick. With most people who buy SUVs
already citing safety as one reason for their purchase, "I don't know
whether it is a big discriminator among the various SUV brands
anymore," said Michael Flynn, director of the University of
Michigan's Office for the Study of Automotive Transportation. Flynn
also suggests that many SUV buyers are fooling themselves when they
use safety as a major criterion for their choice.</TE>
<TE>   Although an SUV is indeed safer for its occupants in a collision
with a smaller passenger car, they are far deadlier than passenger
cars in single-vehicle accidents because of their tendency to roll,
he said. And in SUV- versus-SUV accidents, the combined weight and
stiff frames of the two vehicles make it more likely than in a
car-versus-car accident that occupants will be injured.</TE>
<TE>   Still, SUVs--including truck-based models such as the Ford
Excursion and car-based models such as the Lexus RX 300--accounted
for more than 20% of all passenger-vehicle sales last year, and their
share of the market is expected to climb for years.</TE>
<TE>   So-called crossover SUVs, models that combine elements of car and
truck in the same package, are expected to lead the growth. Most,
like the XC90, look like traditional sport-utility vehicles but are
built on passenger-car platforms and suspensions for improved
handling and ride.</TE>
<TE>   It is a market segment that an auto maker with growth ambitions
cannot afford to ignore, analyst Peterson said.</TE>
<TE>   Volvo executives agree. Plans are to expand to 200,000 vehicles a
year in the U.S. by 2005 and 600,000 worldwide. "But we cannot do
that without a car like this," XC90 project director Hans Wikman
said. Volvo sold 125,710 vehicles in the U.S. last year.</TE>
<TE>   The target market for the XC90--the third in a new family of
all-wheel drive XC (or Cross Country) vehicles from Volvo--will be
buyers moving up from sporty and near-luxury cars such as the Nissan
Maxima and Acura TL or moving over from other near-luxury SUVs.</TE>
<TE>   "We expect 70% of our buyers to be 'conquests' from other brands,"
said Peter Horbury, Volvo's chief designer, who headed the XC90
design team.</TE>
<TE>   The rest will be Volvo customers who have been waiting for an SUV
or who left the brand for a competitor to get an SUV but would return
to Volvo if it had one, said John Neu, U.S. manager for the XC90
project.</TE>
<TE>   When Mercedes-Benz and BMW launched their SUV lines, they were
highly successful in winning customers away from the competition.
Each reported that 80% of first-year sales were to converts from
other brands, Peterson said.</TE>
<TE>   But in both cases, the SUVs were radically different from anything
else the companies offered. Volvo's XC90 "is more like a Volvo wagon
on steroids," said Wes Brown, an industry analyst with the Nextrend
consulting firm in Thousand Oaks. Like Flynn , he believes Volvo
might be aiming too high in predicting a 70% conquest rate.</TE>
<TE>   Volvo began developing its sport-utility in 1998--the year before
its acquisition by Ford--and intended it to be primarily a vehicle
for the North American market. It was designed at Volvo's California
studio in Simi Valley.</TE>
<TE>   Volvo initially expects to sell 50,000 XC90s worldwide; almost
35,000 will be allocated for the U.S., said Thomas Ahlborg, Volvo's
XC90 marketing director.</TE>
<TE>   Although pricing hasn't been set, Volvo insiders say it should
start in the range of $33,000 to $37,000 to be competitive with
vehicles such as the Lexus RX 300 and Mercedes-Benz ML320.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Keeping Things Upright</TE>
<TE>   On the safety front, Volvo decided to use the XC90 to showcase a
number of new systems including roll stability control, which
automatically applies brake pressure to the appropriate wheels to
reduce lateral forces if body tilt approaches a dangerous level.
Instability caused by a high center of gravity is a problem among
SUVs, and Volvo attacked it by designing the XC90 on its existing V70
wagon platform. The new SUV's ground clearance is nearly as high as a
Jeep's and its roof line is 10 inches taller than the Volvo V70 Cross
Country wagon's, but its center of gravity is only 3.5 inches higher.</TE>
<TE>   Volvo safety engineer Christer Gustaffson says the XC90's safety
package also includes a safety cage frame of reinforced,
high-strength steel; seat belts with sensors that tighten the belts
automatically if the roll stability control is activated; and an
inflatable side curtain that extends all the way back to the
third-row seats and covers the side windows to help prevent a
passenger's arm from extending through the window and being crushed
in a rollover.</TE>
<TE>   Critics of SUVs often complain that they are dangerous to other
vehicles in a crash because of their weight, height and structural
stiffness.</TE>
<TE>   Gustaffson said the XC90's front end was designed with a special
reinforced lower frame that sits at passenger-car height. It has
special crumple zones that let it absorb and deflect the force of an
impact to help protect the Volvo's occupants. And by crumpling under
impact, Gustaffson said, it helps protect occupants of the other
vehicle from incursion injuries caused when the traditional SUV's
rigid steel frame pierces the car and stabs into the passenger cabin.</TE>
<TE>   Production hasn't started and the XC90 hasn't been crash-tested by
independent agencies, but project chief Wikman said Volvo is
confident it will win the highest, or five-star, safety ratings in
the U.S. and Europe.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Keeping It in the Family</TE>
<TE>   Volvo design chief Horbury said the challenge was to build an SUV
that still looked like a Volvo, met all of Volvo's safety
requirements and wouldn't compete with the company's workhorse V70
and V70 Cross Country station wagons.</TE>
<TE>   The exterior package captures the essential Volvo-ness of the
vehicle by using the company's signature grille and V-shaped hood.
The high taillights mounted on either side of the rear window are
another Volvo element borrowed from the company's wagons.</TE>
<TE>   But those taillights bend sharply forward to avoid the boxy wagon
look and to shorten the roof line--making the XC90 look a bit shorter
than it really is.</TE>
<TE>   Inside, seating is high and chair-like to give driver and
passengers a good view of the road. Each of the three seats in the
second row is independently adjustable.</TE>
<TE>   In one neat touch other car makers are sure to start copying soon
(Ford will offer it on the 2003 Lincoln Navigator and Ford
Expedition), Volvo engineered the second-row center seat--which
includes an integrated child booster--to slide forward. That gives
parents the ability to position a child in the second row closer to
the front seat occupants.</TE>
<TE>   The optional third-row seats are designed primarily for children
and short-statured adults. All seats except the driver's fold flat,
and the back of the front passenger seat is covered by a plastic
surface so it can serve as a desk when folded.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Nuts and Bolts</TE>
<TE>   Mechanically, the XC90 builds on the V-Series wagon and S-Series
sedan from which its platform was derived. Features include
independent suspension, full-time all-wheel drive, wheel and tire
sizes up to 18 inches in diameter and a pair of gasoline engines for
the U.S. with a diesel option for Europe and Asia.</TE>
<TE>   Both engines available in the U.S.-- a turbocharged five-cylinder
with 210 horsepower and a 272-horsepower inline-six cylinder with
dual turbochargers--are mounted transversely to save space.</TE>
<TE>   "That allowed us to move the passenger compartment forward for
more leg room and more cargo space," Horbury said.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to leather seating and other high-quality interior
trim materials, luxury touches include an "infotainment" system that
will support regular stereo, CD players, navigation systems,
satellite radio and even satellite television. There's optional air
conditioning for the third-row seats and an optional night-vision
system that projects infrared images of distant obstacles on a screen
that pops up from the dashboard.</TE>
<TE>   Wikman said the XC90 is designed to meet California's tough
ultra-low-emissions vehicle standard. The five-cylinder model should
achieve combined city-highway fuel economy ratings in the range of 21
to 24 miles per gallon. Volvo hasn't projected fuel economy numbers
for the much-thirstier twin-turbo model.</TE>
<TE>   The powerful six-cylinder engine is a response to those who long
have argued that the company could kill itself with blandness if all
it did was push safety.</TE>
<TE>   "They don't want to be just the safe car company anymore,"
Peterson said. "They want people to start thinking that you don't
have to be stodgy to drive a Volvo."</TE>

<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The recent report of a 51% increase in the number of pedestrians
killed on Los Angeles streets last year sends a chilling message.</LD>
<LD>   Despite scattered attempts to make California more
pedestrian-friendly, the automobile remains king of the road here.
Heaven help those on foot who think they can always rely on drivers
to stop or even slow down, even at clearly marked crosswalks.</LD>
<LD>   Although pedestrian deaths have declined statewide in recent
years, the Los Angeles Police Department reported 107 pedestrians
killed last year, up from 71 pedestrian deaths in 2000.</LD>
<TE>   The tragedies behind those numbers cannot be ignored. And this
year's death toll has already started.</TE>
<TE>   Three people, including a 12-year-old boy, were killed in Lawndale
last month when a pickup truck struck them as they walked on the
sidewalk. Two other walkers were seriously injured in the accident.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors said the driver of the truck, William Lee Coy, was
legally drunk and charged him with three counts of murder. It wasn't
the first time Coy, 41, has faced charges of driving under the
influence; the Hawthorne man was convicted twice for misdemeanor DUI,
according to the latest criminal complaint.</TE>
<TE>   And in Santa Ana last month, a car hit a 17-year-old girl as she
crossed 17th Street. She died of severe head injuries.</TE>
<TE>   What's the problem?</TE>
<TE>   Some authorities say pedestrian jaywalking accounts for many of
the accidents. Certainly, that is the problem in some cases.</TE>
<TE>   But blaming victims who were trying to cross busy streets when
they were hit--even if they were outside a crosswalk--is not always
fair, said James Corless, California director of the Surface
Transportation Policy Project.</TE>
<TE>   The answer is more complicated than jaywalking. We Californians
can't rely on our transportation officials to provide us with enough
crosswalks, stop signs or decent speed limits, said Corless, whose
nationwide group promotes safe transportation policies.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, the trend in California in the last few years has been to
reduce the number of crosswalks on busy streets, according to the
group's 2000 report on pedestrian safety.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a vicious cycle. When crosswalks are removed on heavily
traveled streets, people end up jaywalking," Corless said.</TE>
<TE>   The rationale for removing crosswalks strikes him as ridiculous,
he said.</TE>
<TE>   Some engineers believe that crosswalks give pedestrians a false
sense of security.</TE>
<TE>   As Corless put it, "That's like removing a traffic signal at an
intersection because you think it will scare drivers and make them
more cautious."</TE>
<TE>   Liability also has been an issue, according to the Surface
Transportation Policy Project report.</TE>
<TE>   "Cities were saying they'd been sued by people injured in the
crosswalks," Corless said. But if people are hit while crossing where
there is no crosswalk, there is no liability, he says.</TE>
<TE>   That makes about as much sense as the justification many traffic
engineers use for increasing speed limits on streets already plagued
by too many accidents and dangerous conditions for pedestrians.</TE>
<TE>   In California, speed limits can be increased to accommodate the
flow of traffic. But who's accommodating the safety of the
pedestrians?</TE>
<TE>   An analysis of federal transportation funding in the Surface
Transportation Policy Project's 2000 report showed that although
California had the second-highest share of pedestrian deaths compared
with all traffic-related fatalities, it ranked last among the 50
states in spending on improving pedestrian safety.</TE>
<TE>   Too often, pleas for tougher speed-limit enforcement, more
crosswalks and more stop signs are ignored, the report said. That
means many--especially those who live in poorer neighborhoods or are
unlucky enough to have to cross busy six-lane streets--are left to
fend for themselves.</TE>
<TE>   Pedestrian collisions cost California at least $1.3 billion in
lost economic productivity in 1999 alone, according to an analysis by
the Children's Safety Network Economics and Insurance Resource
Center.</TE>
<TE>   Medical bills alone from pedestrian accidents cost Californians
and insurers more than $200million that year, according to the
report.</TE>
<TE>   Sure, there has been some progress in cities where flashing lights
have been installed in the pavement at dangerous intersections or
where traffic signals have been changed to give pedestrians more time
to cross busy streets.</TE>
<TE>   Police sting operations have caught drivers failing to yield to
pedestrians, and video cameras have even been used near schools to
cite parents for illegally double-parking and dropping off children
who then have to run across the street.</TE>
<TE>   But more needs to be done, Corless insists.</TE>
<TE>   The emphasis has always been on improving traffic flow. The law
that allows right turns on red lights, for example, benefits drivers
but contributes to pedestrian accidents, Corless said. And not long
ago, traffic engineers defined pedestrians as "traffic flow
interruptions," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Safer street designs to force vehicles to slow down, more visible
crosswalks and a commitment by drivers and pedestrians to be more
responsible are what it's going to take to make streets safer.</TE>

<HD>KNBC Offers Its Own Five-Ring Coverage</HD>
<DH>Television* Some observers question the propriety of the
station sending its reporters to Salt Lake City.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GREG BRAXTON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Let the "Channel 4 News" games begin.</LD>
<LD>   Seeking to capitalize on NBC's coverage of the Winter Olympics,
KNBC-TV is launching its own Olympic platform, as members of the
station's news team travel to Salt Lake City for newscasts and
specials that will originate from the Winter Games site.</LD>
<LD>   Some observers have raised questions about how extensively KNBC's
planned emphasis on Olympic coverage will affect time afforded to
other significant stories, among them the war on terrorism, the
battle over a second term for LAPD Chief Bernard Parks and the
current governor's race.</LD>
<TE>   "There is always a danger that while reporting on something that
is relatively innocuous, a story that is very important could happen
and be overshadowed," said Cynthia Rawitch, chair of the journalism
department at Cal State Northridge.</TE>
<TE>   KNBC's daily 4 and 6 p.m. news will be based in a "specially
designed" studio overlooking the Games' Medals Plaza. The morning,
midday, 5 and 11 p.m. newscasts will be broadcast as usual from
Burbank, supplemented with live reports from Salt Lake City. Paul
Moyer and Colleen Williams will anchor those newscasts.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, a nightly news and entertainment show at 7 p.m.,
"Channel 4 News: Olympic Edition," will present behind-the-scenes
stories and features from the Olympic site, as well as interviews
with athletes based in Southern California.</TE>
<TE>   KNBC news director Kim Godwin maintained that despite the
promotional synergy between the network coverage and the station's
newscasts, KNBC's focus on the Olympics will not eclipse other news
stories.</TE>
<TE>   "News is what we do, no matter what the backdrop is," Godwin said.
"We don't like hard and fast rules, but it's just going to be like
any other day. We're in the position where we can't ignore the news.
Our viewers will get all the news of the day."</TE>
<TE>   She added, "There may be times when the 4 p.m. news will come on
and our Olympic anchors Chuck Henry and Michele Ruiz will say, 'We
need to go back to Burbank.' That's how we'll handle [breaking]
news."</TE>
<TE>   According to Rawitch, however, the widely employed practice of
using local news time to promote network coverage is "not good
journalism. But it's so routine to do this now, to do that kind of
promotion. I just feel there are better things to cover in that 22
minutes of news....</TE>
<TE>   "On the other hand, the state of communication is such that even
if all the top people were at the Games, the station could get back
for a big local story," Rawitch continued, adding that KNBC and other
stations don't devote much time to covering such stories in general.
"I just don't think they do a good job," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Godwin, who joined KNBC last October, acknowledged that stories
surrounding the Olympics will be prominently featured, adding that
the station is poised to take advantage of its resources and what it
hopes will be heightened interest in the Games.</TE>
<TE>   "Post-Sept. 11, there is a real surge of pride and patriotism, and
our athletes are going into the games with that attitude," she said.
"We can tie into that feeling with the news. And it's right in our
backyard. It's a perfect place to tie into the pride of America,
which is really a big story right now."</TE>
<TE>   Still, Godwin stressed that the station will not hesitate to shift
its focus to local news if the situation warrants: "We will probably
go back and forth a bit," she said.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to Henry and Ruiz, 17 members of the station's news
team--including eight anchors and reporters--are being sent to Salt
Lake City.</TE>
<TE>   KNBC's coverage of the Winter Games will kick off at 6:30 p.m.
Friday, before the opening ceremonies, with a one-hour special, "Fred
Roggin's Road to Salt Lake." The longtime sports reporter will
profile several local athletes, including figure skaters Michelle
Kwan and Sasha Cohen.</TE>
<TE>   The live "Channel 4 News: Olympic Edition" will also be anchored
by Henry and Ruiz, with Pat O'Brien--co-host of the syndicated
"Access Hollywood," another NBC property--providing segments for each
installment.</TE>

<HD>Roles Abound for This Dame</HD>
<DH>Movies* In the year since her husband died, Judi Dench has
immersed herself in work, including parts in films that could earn
Oscar nominations.</DH>

<AU>MARK CARO</AU>
<BD>CHICAGO TRIBUNE</BD>
<DL>LONDON</DL>
<LD>"Grief produces energy," Dame Judi Dench was saying over tea--in her
case, coffee--in the stately foyer of the landmark Savoy Hotel.
Sadly, she knows the subject all too well.</LD>
<LD>   The petite 67-year-old English actress, unfussily elegant in a
brown suede jacket and camel scarf, was referring to how the British
and American people, after slogging through a shellshocked,
post-Sept. 11 malaise, had seemed to spring to life.</LD>
<LD>   "So many people since then have turned to the kind of creative
side of them, to want to look at art, to want to go to the theater,
to want to listen to music, you know, a huge kind of surge of that,"
she said in her distinctively soft voice that, nonetheless, is imbued
with authority. "I think always when there's been some terrible thing
that's happened, there is a surge of energy it produces. I think it's
quite life-affirming that we want to somehow look after our spirit."</LD>
<TE>   Dench has found herself trying to do the same over the past year.
In January last year, her husband of 30 years, actor Michael
Williams, died of lung cancer. "There's a natural thing where you
feel so heavy-hearted a lot of the time, and then at some point you
see that there's something you can do to move forward," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Between sips of coffee, she speaks matter-of-factly with the
knowledge that sorrow and moving on are part of a universal natural
cycle.</TE>
<TE>   After Williams died, Dench filmed major roles in "The Shipping
News," "Iris" and "The Importance of Being Earnest" before returning
to the London stage to star in the Edna Ferber-George S. Kaufman 1927
comedy "The Royal Family," which opened in November and is still
playing.</TE>
<TE>   Of those projects, her role in "Iris" seemed the most emotionally
loaded. Dench plays celebrated British author Iris Murdoch in her
late years as she succumbs to Alzheimer's disease while her devoted
husband, John Bayley (Jim Broadbent), tries to keep her comfortable
and happy at home. (Murdoch died in 1999.)</TE>
<TE>   Playing out the final years of a loving, long-standing marriage
wasn't necessarily at the top of Dench's want-to-do list.</TE>
<TE>   "I dreaded it, but I had no need to dread it because in actual
fact it was all right," she said. "It was fine. I knew everybody [on
the film] very well. And somehow it's better when you're working with
people [who], if they know your circumstances but nobody refers to
it, you can get on with life. It's when out of the blue somebody
might say something that catches you unawares--as along as that
doesn't happen, you can manage, you can get on."</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the activity was a tonic.</TE>
<TE>   "It was good that I had so much work and so much traveling and so
much to concentrate on for those months after Michael had died," she
said. "Funny enough, it hit me much worse in the summer when I
stopped."</TE>
<TE>   In a sense, Dench doesn't have to do most of the heavy lifting in
"Iris." The movie alternates between scenes of Murdoch's early life,
with Kate Winslet and Hugh Bonneville playing the couple, and the
period of the author's illness, as Bayley tries to cope while Murdoch
fades.</TE>
<TE>   "In a way, it's worse for the [caretakers of people with]
Alzheimer's than it is for the person themselves, although the early
stages of Alzheimer's--when someone who's very intelligent [becomes
aware of her] mind starting to shut down--must be desperate," Dench
said. "Once it has, in a way they're in their own world, and it's the
John Bayleys of the world one feels the grief for."</TE>
<TE>   Still, Dench's performance is receiving the kind of recognition
that, for her, has become almost routine. The Screen Actors Guild and
British Academy Film Awards have nominated her not only for best
actress for "Iris" but also best supporting actress for "The Shipping
News." The Academy Award nominations, to be announced Tuesday, may
very well follow suit.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, Dench wouldn't be able to work so often if she weren't
getting the roles, which is no small feat at a time when most veteran
actresses are struggling to find worthy projects. Dench is hot now,
yet before she starred in--and received an Oscar nomination for--John
Madden's "Mrs. Brown" in 1997, her movie career highlights were
playing James Bond's boss, M, and appearing in supporting roles in
films such as "A Room With a View" (1987), "A Handful of Dust" (1988)
and Kenneth Branagh's "Hamlet" (1996--and she's only in the long
version).</TE>
<TE>   Dench has a simple theory for why she's in such demand.</TE>
<TE>   "Harvey Weinstein is the answer," she said, referring to the
Miramax honcho whose company has made her a fixture in such films as
"Mrs. Brown," "Shakespeare in Love" (which earned Dench a best
supporting actress Oscar for her memorable turn as Queen Elizabeth),
"Chocolat," "The Shipping News," "Iris" and "The Importance of Being
Earnest" (scheduled for release later this year).</TE>
<TE>   She 'Sets the Tone For Everybody Else'</TE>
<TE>   "My film career would have been as it always was, spasmodic in the
extreme, if he hadn't taken up 'Mrs. Brown,'" she continued. "And if
John Madden hadn't directed 'Shakespeare in Love,' I might just have
done 'Mrs. Brown' and then gone back to the theater."</TE>
<TE>   Weinstein is happy to be unofficial president of the Judi Dench
fan club.</TE>
<TE>   "I think she's one of the definitive actresses of her time," he
said from New York. "She's incredibly professional and sets the tone
for everybody else. And I have a major crush on her."</TE>
<TE>   He added that he plans to continue casting Dench whenever
possible.</TE>
<TE>   "If there's a role within that age category, she's the one,"
Weinstein said. "And if there's a role not in that age category, I'll
rewrite the script to tailor it to her. And if there's a sex-change
operation involved, I'll do that too."</TE>
<TE>   In fact, a male professor role in an upcoming Miramax movie is
being reworked for Dench, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Lasse Hallstrom, who directed Dench in "Chocolat" and "The
Shipping News," said he marveled at how she was able to be
consistently believable without showing any effort.</TE>
<TE>   "You never really see her go off-track or have bad moments,"
Hallstrom said from upstate New York. "There must be a technique in
some way, but during the course of these two movies, I've never seen
it show on screen. It's just always an emotional presence and a
credibility in everything she does."</TE>
<TE>   To Dench, her film career is frosting on a rich, thick cake whose
ingredients include years performing with the Royal Shakespeare
Company, the Royal National Theatre, the Old Vic Theatre and the
Nottingham Playhouse. Movie stardom, she said, was never a concern.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a huge surprise, and I'm extremely glad because it means I
get work, and I want to work," Dench said. "Long may it last."</TE>
<TE>   Nevertheless, for Dench the stage still has its advantages.</TE>
<TE>   "What I don't like about film is I haven't got control over it,"
she said. "I have that control in the theater. I can do a better
performance tonight and know at the end of it. I know by the fact of
whether you get a laugh or not. You know where a laugh is, and you
don't get it and don't get it, and quite suddenly you say it in a
slightly different way and you get the laugh, and you think, 'That's
how that's done.' Too late in film. Too late."</TE>
<TE>   For what it's worth, Dench doesn't have any special duties for
having been royally anointed a dame in 1988.</TE>
<TE>   "No, nothing at all comes with it except that a lot of people call
you Dame Dench, which is very funny. Dame Smith. Dame Dench," she
said, referring to her similarly venerated colleague Maggie Smith.
"Nobody knows it's the equivalent of a knight. But what is
extraordinary is if you're knighted here, your wife becomes 'lady.'
And if you're made a dame, which is equivalent to a knight, your
husband doesn't become 'sir.'"</TE>

<HD>CBS Buys Rights to Unseen Sept. 11 Video</HD>
<DH>Television*  The dramatic footage, which includes rescue
efforts and shots of the first plane, will be made into a special to
be broadcast next month.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELIZABETH JENSEN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>CBS has acquired rights to dramatic, never-broadcast footage of the
Sept. 11 attack on New York's World Trade Center--shot by two French
brothers who were on the scene--that will be turned into a two-hour
special to be broadcast March 10.</LD>
<LD>   Filmmaker Jules Naudet was at the New York site working on a
documentary about the brotherhood of New York firefighters when the
attacks took place; his brother, Gedeon, arrived later with
additional members of the Ladder 1 firefighters. Their footage, which
includes 45 minutes of rescue efforts from inside one of the towers
before it collapsed, is thought to be the only known video of the
plane that hit the first tower and has been hotly sought by other
networks, including ABC and HBO.</LD>
<LD>   CBS declined to say how much it paid for the rights, but Jim
Wiatt, president and co-chief executive officer of the William Morris
Agency, which made the deal, said there was no bidding war and that
"the intent was to pay for the cost of the film and donate money to
firemen. This is not a money-making project."</LD>
<TE>   The footage landed at CBS, he said, at the suggestion of Vanity
Fair editor Graydon Carter, who was advising the brothers because of
a personal relationship. Carter will be an executive producer of the
TV project, and the magazine will run an interview with the Naudets
in March.</TE>
<TE>   The broadcast will be a joint effort of CBS' news and
entertainment divisions. Susan Zirinsky, executive producer of CBS
News' "48 Hours," is also one of the executive producers, along with
the brothers.</TE>
<TE>   Zirinsky said it isn't an official CBS News production because the
brothers wanted it to be a fund-raiser and as such "does not fit
under the CBS News umbrella."</TE>
<TE>   There will be no dramatized moments, she said, as had been
discussed at other networks.</TE>
<TE>   The producers are drawing from the full 140 hours of footage shot
by the brothers to craft what Zirinsky called "a kind of witness to
history, a camera at ground zero." A snippet of the footage was
released at the time of the attacks, but the rest of it has never
before been seen publicly.</TE>
<TE>   The deal represents CBS' second prime-time entertainment project
related to the Sept. 11 attacks, following confirmed plans for a
two-hour movie from author-filmmaker Lawrence Schiller that will
document events surrounding United Airlines Flight 93, which crashed
that day in rural Pennsylvania. CBS officials were also pitched a
comedy series with a Sept. 11 plot line (a couple united after their
spouses died in the attacks), but that project has since fizzled.</TE>
<TE>   The Naudet brothers and firefighter James Hanlon, another
executive producer, will donate proceeds from the production to the
Uniformed Firefighters Assn. Scholarship Fund. The project is also
expected to include an appeal to the public for donations.</TE>

<HD>A New Remedy: Directing</HD>
<DH>Actor Eriq La Salle, fresh from 'ER,' moved behind the
camera to make the feature film 'Crazy as Hell.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SUSAN KING</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Eriq La Salle checked out of NBC's "ER" in November after eight
seasons as arrogant but brilliant surgeon Dr. Peter Benton, and he
hasn't had a chance to catch his breath since.</LD>
<LD>   He and director D.J. Caruso have had their production company,
Humble Journey, firmly entrenched at Warner Bros. for the last five
years. La Salle is one of the executive producers of Caruso's
upcoming film "The Salton Sea," starring Val Kilmer. La Salle also
will be seen later this year in the Robin Williams movie "One Hour
Photo." And tonight, his feature film directorial debut, "Crazy as
Hell," opens the 10th annual Pan African Film Festival.</LD>
<LD>   "I'm actually getting a little excited," La Salle said at the
Humble Journey offices on the Warner lot in Burbank. "We have been
getting RSVPs from most of the major studios and the small studios.
We have a really good lineup."</LD>
<TE>   Besides directing the psychological thriller, La Salle is a
producer, writer and star. He plays a man who checks himself into a
mental institution claiming to be Satan. With his bald pate, fancy
earrings, long fingernails and outlandish clothes, La Salle's
character is something of an outrageous dandy with a wicked smile. He
unnerves a maverick psychiatrist (Michael Beach), who is being
followed around-the-clock by a documentary film crew. Beach's
character, though, seems in need of a shrink himself as he is
constantly haunted by the specters of his dead wife and 7-year-old
daughter.</TE>
<TE>   "We had fun with it," says La Salle, who is far friendlier and
more down-to-earth than his longtime, brooding small-screen persona.</TE>
<TE>   La Salle had the script for "Crazy as Hell" for four years trying
to interest major studios and independent companies. "I wanted to do
this thing, and I wanted to do it the way I wanted to do it," he
says. "I wanted to have certain freedoms."</TE>
<TE>   But it was a hard sell. "Some people don't get it," says La Salle.
"They don't get the psychological thriller aspect of it because the
whole point of the movie is you don't know [if he is Satan]. If you
have the character performing some supernatural feats, then that
defeats the purpose. We wanted to have the audience guess. If it were
a big studio film, walls would be bleeding. That was not the type of
film we were trying to make."</TE>
<TE>   "We had an offer the year before to make 'Crazy,'" says Caruso.
"We had a lot more money that was going to be given to us from an
independent company, but they had rules and stipulations on whom to
cast and how to make it. That is just part of the independent world.
There were suggestions for the cast that turned us off."</TE>
<TE>   The impetus to do the film his way came as a result of La Salle
seeing Darren Aronofsky's dark drama "Requiem for a Dream."</TE>
<TE>   "I thought it was such a beautifully disturbing film," says La
Salle, 39. "I felt it was uncompromised. I felt like this was a story
that this filmmaker wanted to tell, and I really admired it. I just
said, 'I am going to go and shoot my movie.'"</TE>
<TE>   La Salle, who made $27 million for his last three years on "ER,"
financed the film himself. "I can't say what the budget was," he says
with a smile. "I'd have to kill you."</TE>
<TE>   He cast himself as the man who would be Satan because, he says,
actors get turned on doing interesting roles and characters. "When I
read this and saw the potential of this outlandish character, I
obviously was attracted to it. When we were going the studio route, I
toyed with not playing the role. And then at some point, I said, go
for it.</TE>
<TE>   "The other reason I did it was I definitely wanted my first
project done post-'ER' to be something so far removed from what
people's impression of me as an actor was or how they associated me
with a specific character for nine years. This was very, very
different. I had a ball."</TE>
<TE>   "Crazy as Hell" was shot in 19 days on 24-frame-per-second digital
video--the same format George Lucas used for his upcoming "Star Wars:
Episode II--Attack of the Clones."</TE>
<TE>   "I liked the Steadicam," he says. "I didn't want to overdo it. But
we felt it made sense and saved time--and, of course, saved money. I
wanted to add fluidity to the film. Low-budget filmmaking can still
have eye candy. I think you can still have things aesthetically
pleasing. That is what we were going for."</TE>
<TE>   La Salle also cast actors Beach, John C. McGinley and Ronny Cox,
whom he had worked with on other films he directed--the award-winning
short "Psalms From the Underground" and the HBO film "Rebound: The
Legend of Earl 'The Goat' Manigault."</TE>
<TE>   Beach, a regular on "Third Watch," has known La Salle for nearly
two decades. He says that the two have a form of shorthand
communication on the set. "All he needs is to say one or two things,
and I understand him," says Beach. "I see where he's coming from. We
already have a very similar way about how we think about acting and
how we feel about it. So it makes it a lot easier."</TE>
<TE>   "Crazy as Hell" is the first film to open the Pan African Film &amp;
Arts Festival that doesn't already have a distributor. About 150
movies will unspool at the festival, North America's largest event
dedicated to independent black films from the U.S. and around the
world. It runs today through Feb. 18 at the Magic Johnson Theatres.
Tonight's gala takes place at the Loews Cineplex Odeon Century Plaza.</TE>
<TE>   The Humble Journey logo has a little boy facing mountains. La
Salle says he chose the name because "no matter how successful you
think you are, there is always something that I think will put you in
check. I am appreciative of that. Just because I was on the No. 1
show for eight years does not guarantee that I will step into a
situation where everything will be handed to you. That keeps you
humble, and everything is a journey. Everything is a lesson. There
are always peaks and valleys."</TE>
<TE>   And he doesn't want to lose the little boy inside him--the one who
grew up in Hartford, Conn., idolizing Sidney Poitier. "You always
want to stay in touch with the little boy because that little boy
used to dream of telling stories, used to dream of being an actor,
used to dream of when I grow up I want to do this. It wasn't about
contracts or the size of your trailer. It was about the love of being
fascinated by stories. So long as you can keep in touch with that and
keep it a priority, that keeps you honest and humble."</TE>
<TE>   La Salle is still under contract to "ER" for the rest of this
season. Though his character was written out in the fall, he could be
called back for more appearances. But he's set against coming back
next season and says he doesn't regret giving up his "ER" paycheck.</TE>
<TE>   "The big secret that a lot of people don't understand about most
actors is that if you are really true artists, you'll do this for
free," he says. "'ER' has given me a successful career and put me in
a position to do films. It is a major part of my life and my career,
but the decision to leave was truly not an obstacle. If I had
continued to stay, it would have been just for the money, and that is
not the artist I would want to be, and I don't think it is what the
fans deserve. My passions lie elsewhere."</TE>

<HD>Bogosian Says So Long to Solo Performances</HD>
<DH>The older and wiser bad boy of monologuists says he is
moving on to new projects.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>IRENE LACHER</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>May 23, 2000--It's over, Eric Bogosian writes in one of his Web site
"meditations": "I don't think I'm going to write another solo after
this. The dog is done."</LD>
<LD>   Feb. 6, 2002--Bogosian will be as good as his word when the
well-known monologuist gives his final tour, appearing in Los Angeles
as part of UCLA's Solo Festival. Wave goodbye to the con-man guru,
the obsequious actor, the biker drug dealer and other darkly
hilarious characters that have sprung full grown from his abrasive
imagination since he came to prominence as a bad-boy solo performer
two decades ago. This dog is done.</LD>
<LD>   "The allure of hotel rooms and airports isn't what it was when I
was 26, when I thought the coolest thing was to be endlessly
traveling," said Bogosian, 48, in a telephone interview from New
York, where he lives with his wife, director Jo Anne Bonney, and
their two adolescent sons.</LD>
<TE>   For a while, Bogosian and other monologuists like Spalding Gray
and Tim Miller made a splash in theater with their solution for being
unable to make a splash in theater: With little means and plenty to
say, they became everything--writer, director, universe. Monologuists
started out pursuing an art form that was light on its feet. Some
ended up luring sold-out houses and the cameras of prominent
directors like Jonathan Demme and Oliver Stone, who went on to direct
Bogosian in "Talk Radio" (1988), the searing multi-character film
about an acerbic talk-show host who first appeared in a monologue.
Over the years, Bogosian has written 100 monologues, which have been
strung together into six one-man shows.</TE>
<TE>   "It seemed like a fluke when it started to take off in the early
'80s," he said. "I wanted to inventory the different people who lived
inside me as an actor. It was a finger exercise for acting. I didn't
know it would become popular and then garner attention and good
reviews from newspapers. All of that stuff started to feed on itself,
and when there was an opportunity to do another show, I said, 'What
the hell.'</TE>
<TE>   "I had a system where I would go to [New York's] P.S. 122 or the
Knitting Factory, goof around, come up with new ideas and come up
with a show. The one I like best is 'Pounding Nails in the Floor With
My Forehead,' which was in '94 [in New York]. That went so well I
squeezed another one out. The last time around it felt different; it
didn't feel like it was coming naturally. I think I had become too
self-conscious about making a show that would make the kind of impact
that the other shows had when I hadn't been thinking about anything
but amusing myself. The minute I started thinking about an
audience--wouldn't it be great if it was a hit like the others?--it
was the wrong way to think about making work."</TE>
<TE>   Of course, he's his own worst critic. The Village Voice enthused
that "Wake Up and Smell the Coffee," his most recent solo show, was
"daring, even breathtaking." Still, the monologuist's life hasn't
been so glamorous of late. For "Coffee" two years ago, Bogosian moved
into the Jane Street Theatre after "Hedwig and the Angry Inch" moved
out. The funky New York venue is in the basement of "a sleazy old
hotel," as he puts it, and the entry to the stage, always locked, was
unlocked only so he could get onstage.</TE>
<TE>   "Otherwise, I'd end up with somebody onstage with me who was
looking for the bathroom or a drug dealer," he said. "The hotel was a
wild place. All that locking and being alone in the dressing room,
which was six stories above the stage, it was lonely. And I'd been
working more and more with casts in movies, and I'd gotten used to
having people around."</TE>
<TE>   His First Novel, New Play Are Among Endeavors</TE>
<TE>   When the next solo show didn't materialize after "Coffee," he
toured "The Worst of Eric Bogosian," a selection from "Coffee,"
"Pounding" and "Sex, Drugs, Rock &amp; Roll" (1990). Then in recent
years, Bogosian has become enmeshed in different sorts of projects.
His first novel, "Mall," an apocalyptic tale of a speed freak who
shoots his mother, torches his house and goes to the local mall with
a bag of weapons, has just been published in paperback by Scribner.
His multi-character play "Humpty Dumpty," about four vacationing
urban professionals who lose contact with the outside world, will
premiere in the spring. He'll also appear in Atom Egoyan's next film,
"Ararat."</TE>
<TE>   "I was moving into another mode with writing," he says. "There's a
big difference between the physical nature of a 25- and a
45-year-old. It was natural for me to get onstage and tear the place
up when I was 25. Closing in on 50, it's more natural to sit down
with a body of text and dot all the I's and cross all the T's. I was
way too all-over-the-place 15 years ago to focus."</TE>
<TE>   Bogosian isn't the only part of the monologue equation that may
have seen better days. He's found fewer audiences in tune with his
edgy sensibility, especially outside the country's more sophisticated
hubs of culture. On his Web site (www.ericbogosian.com), he
mischievously memorialized a 1995 letter to the editor of the Austin
newspaper, decrying his work as "pure unadulterated filth.... Eric
Bogosian insulted every sensibility and moral ethic we hold dear, and
we hope that our return of our tickets ... blah blah blah."</TE>
<TE>   He calls such befuddled Bogosian-watchers his
"deer-in-the-headlights audience."</TE>
<TE>   "I love being onstage, but I don't know if I understand the
audiences out there. My stuff is funny and wordy and aggressive but
self-deprecating, and it all makes sense to me. Sometimes I feel like
I'm a bug on a pin being examined. I don't feel my tribe is out there
as much as 10 years ago."</TE>
<TE>   Bogosian fully expects to find his tribe in L.A., where he has
fond memories of two runs at the Mark Taper Forum ("Sex" in 1991 and
"Pounding" in 1993). He'll tailor his performance to the more open
sensibility of an L.A. audience.</TE>
<TE>   "As I go into a more urban theater, I identify more with the
audience, so I would perform exactly the show I would want to see. I
won't do anything light or easy. I'll do the harder stuff, not too
sentimental, and I guess it puts me on the spot or puts my life on
the spot or puts the audience on the spot. To some degree you've got
to take potshots at somebody. That's how humor gets made. In a
smaller city where people don't know me well, it's probably not a
good idea to come out with both guns blasting at the top of the show.
I can intimidate a whole theater. In L.A., I won't worry about that.
And I like to start a show on that note--loud and fast and harsh."</TE>
<TE>   Bogosian is anticipating the opportunity to perform for his
colleagues here. Perhaps less well known than his monologues is the
steady work he's been doing in Hollywood, a place where, as he has
tartly written on his Web site, "Producers have no patience for
artists." He's been making his living writing for and acting in
movies and television. He wrote the script for the film "subUrbia"
based on his 1994 play. He has had character roles (on "Third Watch,"
for example) and has a pilot under consideration at CBS.</TE>
<TE>   That hasn't always been a comfortable fit. "Working as a writer
means you have to learn to take notes and behave yourself," he said.
"The Los Angeles industry really respects team playing, and it's also
comprised of individuals who are champing at the bit to break loose
and write a novel or make an independent film. All of us have to ask
ourselves, why do we keep going back to the well? It's part of the
madness of it."</TE>
<TE>   In "Worst Of ... ," expect to see Bogosian hold up the mirror for
show business' hubristic self, with overreaching characters that have
poured out of his stinging pen since he started out writing about the
underclass. After all, Bogosian isn't kidding himself that this L.A.
run will be any kind of showcase.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm obviously not going to be getting roles in any movies by
doing any one-man show. I think I'm a known quantity at this point."</TE>
<TE>   No matter. Bogosian's heart truly belongs to the stage anyway.
"There's nothing like the feeling of total approval when an audience
is with you. With a solo show, all that energy goes into your chest
and makes you feel like a giant. But I just think time is limited,
and I want to be sure I'm doing the thing that's giving me the most
satisfaction.</TE>
<TE>   "I watched with interest colleagues who have walked onto a solo
stage and then become big movie stars. I think maybe I should have
tried to have done that. I spend a lot of time second-guessing
myself. You wanted to live in New York, and you wanted to be near
your family. Did I make the right move? Did I make the wrong move? It
feels right for me. Keeping those questions in the forefront are
important to making me stay alive as an artist."</TE>

<LD>There are a number of questions you want to ask John McLaughlin, not
least among them if he has ever strained his throat yelling "Wrong!"
at a shellshocked panelist on "The McLaughlin Group," the Washington,
D.C.-based discussion show he produces and hosts, which will reach
its 20th anniversary in April.</LD>
<LD>   In a conversation with McLaughlin, the responses come easily; it's
getting a word in edgewise that's hard.</LD>
<LD>   McLaughlin was in Los Angeles last week, schmoozing donors for
local PBS station KCET, which began carrying his nationally
distributed weekly program (having already aired McLaughlin's
interview show, "One on One") in January.</LD>
<TE>   "The McLaughlin Group" played for years in Southern California on
KNBC before NBC launched its ill-fated XFL football league, at which
time the station preempted the series for 12 weeks. That set the ball
rolling for the move, although KNBC and McLaughlin offer somewhat
different versions of why it happened.</TE>
<TE>   There is more than a little irony, or maybe poetic justice, in the
fact that McLaughlin found himself victimized by the XFL, the league
NBC founded in conjunction with the World Wrestling Federation. After
all, many feel McLaughlin flourished by taking the trappings of
wrestling and applying them to talk, the body-slamming here being of
the verbal variety.</TE>
<TE>   "McLaughlin" has been criticized on other fronts as well. The
emphasis on making predictions, for example, has spurred some
critics--among them former panelist Michael Kinsley--to suggest such
an approach depresses the level of political discourse and
journalism.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, journalists now face the temptation of pandering to
the talk-show appetite, recognizing such forums as a springboard to
cash in on the lecture and book circuit. Each guest in the
fluctuating roster usually receives about $1,000 per appearance (the
host, of course, owns the franchise), but McLaughlin is quick to note
that panelists fill their pockets in other ways.</TE>
<TE>   Just being on the show "is very lucrative," he said. "It leads to
white-collar crime, which is lecturing. They know that, and that
helps keep their appetite for a piece of me at a lower level. I say,
'What about this? I see you've been out on the road.'"</TE>
<TE>   My goal was to get McLaughlin's thoughts on the talking-head
culture he has helped popularize, with sons of
"McLaughlin"--including Fox News Channel's "The Beltway Boys,"
featuring former regulars Morton Kondracke and Fred Barnes--popping
up all across the dial.</TE>
<TE>   McLaughlin took me to lunch at the ritzy Water Grill in downtown
L.A., and despite his clipped tones, no one would accuse this former
Jesuit priest of being short-winded. Indeed, based on his lunchtime
patter, I began to fear inquiring about his tie would prompt a
dissertation on the history of haberdasheries in America. After
asking how his show wound up on KCET, I found myself listening to a
long story about his testimony to Congress before the birth of PBS in
the 1960s. When he paused to take a bite of his scallops and the next
sentence began, "The show started in April of '82 on WRC in
Washington," I briefly contemplated how much iced tea it would take,
swallowed quickly, to kill a man my size.</TE>
<TE>   Still, there's no question that McLaughlin, who is 74 but doesn't
like to discuss it, knows his audience and truly seems to believe his
show inspires debate that is "therapeutic for the public."</TE>
<TE>   To McLaughlin, TV talk has supplanted the street cafe or barber
shop as a center for public discourse, providing an outlet for people
"too harried and hurried" to engage in such vigorous dialogue on
their own.</TE>
<TE>   "It's as simple as that," he said. "It's an appetite that's
developed, to have a meeting place, a talking place, a forum, for the
exchange of ideas"--abetted, he added, by his show's taped
introductions, which "pull apart the polarities of the issue so
they're very clearly set forth."</TE>
<TE>   Of course, anyone who has watched "McLaughlin" or any other TV
talk show comes away with the impression that the most knowledgeable
person in the world won't be invited back if unable to present
arguments in an entertaining fashion, hence the emphasis on
predictions, posturing and other show-business trappings.</TE>
<TE>   "Civilized discourse does not have to be dull. That's No. 1,"
McLaughlin countered. "Secondly, it's not a shout-fest. Individuals
gather with passionate beliefs about public policy issues, and I hire
them because they are so passionate as well as informed."</TE>
<TE>   Although he served as a special assistant during the Nixon and
Ford administrations, McLaughlin describes himself as a registered
independent (labeled conservative, he quipped, because of his
"tyrannical and dictatorial manner") and the ideological "swing vote"
on his program, which now offers an extra four minutes of content
previously excised to make room for commercials on KNBC.</TE>
<TE>   Addressing charges of liberal bias within the media in general and
PBS in particular, McLaughlin, a staunch supporter of public
broadcasting, sees some merit in those claims but proposes the larger
pitfall at PBS is a tendency toward elitism.</TE>
<TE>   As for explaining his longevity in this perceived tree-hugging
environment, I could have sworn I asked but later realized my point
somehow got lost amid another McLaughlin monologue.</TE>
<TE>   McLaughlin did express scant concern about the proliferation of
daily talk on cable undercutting his weekly showcase, and shrugged
off media coverage of the tussle between CNN and Fox News as gossip
feasted upon by media folk--and pretty much them alone.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it's mostly an inside sport for journalists," he said. "I
just hope it doesn't take up too much of anybody's time."</TE>
<TE>   By the time we stood up from the table, I realized McLaughlin had
steered the entire interview the way he controls one of his programs
and began to appreciate how he has made a living all these years,
even if I might yell "Wrong!" in response to his definition of what
constitutes a shout-fest.</TE>
<TE>   "Journalists tend to meet without joy, live together without
conviviality, and leave each other without sorrow," he noted at one
point.</TE>
<TE>   True enough. And every once in awhile, they're reminded that
ultimately, there's no such thing as a free lunch.</TE>

<HD>King's 'Dream' Endures in Mix of Music, Drama</HD>
<DH>Yolanda King, daughter of the slain civil rights leader,
brings her father's message to life on Southland stages for Black
History Month.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DARYL H. MILLER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"If you can't fly, run," the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. is heard
saying as the lights dim. "If you can't run, walk. If you can't walk,
crawl. But by all means, keep moving."</LD>
<LD>   Daughter Yolanda King then takes the stage to keep spreading that
message, through an inspirational mixture of drama, music and dance
that she calls "Achieving the Dream."</LD>
<LD>   Introduced in 1996 during the Centennial Olympic Games in Atlanta,
the show is being presented in Los Angeles as part of the city
Cultural Affairs Department events commemorating Black History Month.
Performances continue Friday through Sunday at the downtown Los
Angeles Theatre Center, then move to the Madrid Theatre in Canoga
Park Feb. 15-24.</LD>
<TE>   A freedom march of a show, "Achieving the Dream" walks with pride
through the history of civil rights as King inhabits a succession of
emblematic characters: a girl boarding a newly desegregated bus in
the late 1950s; a marcher staring down attack dogs and fire hoses in
1963 Birmingham, Ala.; an activist camping in mud on the Washington
Mall as part of 1968's Resurrection City campaign to publicize the
plight of the poor; and a present-day businesswoman attempting to
shatter a glass ceiling, among others.</TE>
<TE>   Working on an essentially bare stage, the actress--whose credits
include the 1996 film "Ghosts of Mississippi" and the 1978 miniseries
"King"--shifts smoothly and distinctly from one character to the
next, swapping key bits of costuming, and adjusting her voice and
body language.</TE>
<TE>   The script, by King and Cheryl Adams Odeleye, is rendered in
strokes broad enough to be understood by children as well as adults.
While this sometimes makes the material seem too explanatory or too
obvious, it also offers a chance to see through a child's eyes and
learn anew.</TE>
<TE>   Some touches are deliciously sly, such as the warning against
complacency that comes in the form of a disco diva who dances through
the '70s in carefree oblivion while hard-won initiatives are under
attack.</TE>
<TE>   Gospel music by Eyvonne Williams frames many of the vignettes and
helps to advance messages of unity, resilience and faith. Williams
performs some songs; a guest vocalist handles the rest (Linda
Hopkins, Dawnn Lewis, Rae'Ven Larrymore Kelly and Patti Henley are
scheduled to alternate throughout the run).</TE>
<TE>   Dance enters the mix as part of a lyrically abstract depiction of
the 1963 church bombing that killed four girls in Birmingham.</TE>
<TE>   Ashley Thompson sways free and easy, filled with hope and
promise--only to see her world explode in the bomb's blood-red glare.</TE>
<TE>   The disparate art forms don't always flow into one another as
smoothly as they could, but under Ron Stacker Thompson's
straightforward direction, everything keeps moving purposefully
ahead.</TE>
<TE>   The Rev. King's voice is heard from time to time, and his image
materializes onstage during the celebratory curtain call. His hopes
haven't all come to pass, the show admits, but his dream remains very
much alive.</TE>

<LD>   Tony-Winning Director to Tackle the Big Screen</LD>
<LD>   Susan Stroman, who won a pair of Tonys for choreographing and
directing "The Producers" on Broadway, is making her feature film
directorial debut with a USA Films version of "Contact," her Tony
Award-winning musical.</LD>
<TE>   The movie, to be adapted by John Weidman and produced by Laurence
Mark, is due to begin production later this year in New York, Variety
reports. The piece will focus on the third of three segments--the
story of a middle-aged ad exec who's captivated by a woman in a
yellow dress. It will incorporate more dialogue than the stage
production, which focused almost exclusively on dance. Choreography
from all three acts will be woven in.</TE>

<TE>   Green, Carey Top Movie Stinkers List</TE>
<TE>   And the losers are: Tom Green's decidedly unfunny "Freddy Got
Fingered" and Mariah Carey's "Glitter." Or so says the Hastings Bad
Cinema Society--a group of movie aficionados--in its nominations for
its annual Stinkers awards.</TE>
<TE>   "Freddy" received seven nominations (including worst film, worst
actor, worst song, worst on-screen couple, most intrusive musical
score and most painfully unfunny comedy). Carey, meanwhile, is
considered a front-runner in the worst actress category, which
includes Angelina Jolie ("Original Sin"), Tea Leoni ("Jurassic Park
III"), Jennifer Lopez ("Angel Eyes" and "The Wedding Planner") and
Penelope Cruz ("Vanilla Sky," "Blow" and "Captain Corelli's
Mandolin").</TE>
<TE>   Other nominees for worst film of 2001: "Pearl Harbor," "3000 Miles
to Graceland" and "Town &amp; Country."</TE>
<TE>   The winners will be announced March 22--two days prior to the
Academy Awards telecast--on the society's web site
(www.thestinkers.com). For $5, individuals can join the group and
fill out a ballot.</TE>

<TE>   RADIO</TE>
<TE>   L.A. Theatre Works to Air Weekly on KPCC</TE>
<TE>   L.A. Theatre Works' "The Play's the Thing," broadcast on KCRW-FM
(89.9) until a bitter separation last March, has found a new
Southland home. Beginning March 2, the radio theater series will air
on KPCC-FM (89.3) on Saturdays from 8 to 10 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   The pieces, which in the spring season will feature talent such as
Hilary Swank, Elliott Gould, Glenne Headly and Richard Schiff, are
recorded live at the Skirball Cultural Center for later broadcast.
The group was off the air locally until X-FM Satellite Broadway
Channel picked it up in November</TE>
<TE>   "This is the first time in our history that we'll be on public
radio 52 weeks a year with our own two-hour time slot--and Garrison
Keillor's 'Prairie Home Companion' as lead in," producing director
Susan Loewenberg told The Times Tuesday. "We were just one element in
'KCRW Playhouse' and ran only 17 times in the last year. KPCC agreed
with us that we're the perfect match to their all-talk format, since
we also deal in the spoken word and add a different texture."</TE>
<TE>   The plays will adopt a new format, adding behind-the-scenes
features and interviews with actors and directors to help provide
more context.</TE>

<TE>   TELEVISION</TE>
<TE>   Powell to Field Questions on MTV</TE>
<TE>   Following in the footsteps of former President Bill Clinton (who
fielded questions about what kind of underwear he wore), the U.S.
secretary of state plans to have a heart-to-heart discussion with MTV
viewers.</TE>
<TE>   Channels in the Middle East, Italy, United Kingdom and Ireland,
Brazil and Russia also will run "Be Heard: An MTV Global Discussion
With Colin Powell" on Valentine's Day at 8 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   The show, hosted by John Norris and Gideon Yago, will be taped the
morning of Feb. 14 before a studio audience in Washington, D.C.
Bilingual VJs in each territory will guide the satellite questions
and answers, translating the questions on the spot.</TE>
<TE>   Though MTV is not a typicalvenue for members of the Bush
administration, the global reach of the network is a draw in its
campaign to send out a message in its war with terrorism, Reuters
points out. The forum was arranged independently of Hollywood's
special wartime committee, but it jibes nicely with a pledge by the
entertainment business to foster a dialogue between the U.S. and
other countries--especially in the Middle East.</TE>

<TE>   QUICK TAKES</TE>
<TE>   Ron Howard ("A Beautiful Mind") has been chosen director of the
year by the nation's movie exhibitors, who will award him the prize
at their annual ShoWest convention in March.... Oscar-winning
composer Hans Zimmer will make a cameo appearance and perform live in
Los Angeles for the first time in his career, joining Senegalese
artist Baaba Maal at his Los Angeles concert at UCLA's Royce Hall
Thursday. Zimmer will perform selections from his soundtrack for
"Black Hawk Down," in which Maal was featured.... The Los Angeles
Master Chorale will present the U.S. premiere of "Two Songs to Poems
of Ann Jaderlund," the first choral work by Los Angeles Philharmonic
music director Esa-Pekka Salonen, on March 16 at the Dorothy Chandler
Pavilion. Two days later, Grant Gershon will conduct the group in a
recording of the piece.... Arthel Neville, co-host of Fox News'
"Celebrity Spotlight," has been hired as the new host of CNN's
"TalkBack Live," a town meeting-style show airing weekdays at
noon.... Journalist Phil Shuman has joined KCOP-TV Channel 13 to
anchor its "Best of Unit 13" telecast on Saturdays and Sundays....
Rosemary Clooney will not perform at Long Beach's Richard and Karen
Carpenter Performing Arts Center on March 23 because she is

<HD>The Way 'Rollerball' Bounces</HD>
<DH>Movies* The film struggles against negative buzz over an
early screening even though it has been recut since then.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD NATALE</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Consider this a cautionary tale for operating in Hollywood during the
age of test screenings, spin strategies and the fickle power of the
Internet.</LD>
<LD>   After being delayed from its planned opening last summer, John
McTiernan's remake of the 1975 futuristic film "Rollerball" finally
opens Friday. The original, directed by Norman Jewison and starring
James Caan, is a cult favorite and--with a violent action-filled
sport at its core--seemed ripe for a remake in this video game age.</LD>
<LD>   But even if critics and audiences ultimately warm to McTiernan's
vision, it may never overcome the negative buzz it has been
generating since its first test screenings last spring.</LD>
<TE>   Bad breaks, bad timing, bad-mouthing--"Rollerball" has been a
victim of all of them, though its reputation is based on a cut of the
film that no longer exists. After reshoots last summer and further
edits to conform to the Motion Picture Assn. of America guidelines
for a PG-13 release, the finished "Rollerball" was publicly screened
for the first time only this week.</TE>
<TE>   Even the slick ad campaign MGM mounted, which seemed to suggest a
National Hockey League game played by members of the World Wrestling
Federation (if that's not redundant), garnered the movie negative
publicity. Last week Universal Pictures successfully enjoined the
studio from touting that "Rollerball" was created by the filmmakers
who brought us "The Fast and the Furious," last summer's sleeper hit.
The only connection between the two movies is screenwriter John
Pogue, who co-adapted the new "Rollerball" with Larry Ferguson. Pogue
had done some uncredited script doctoring on "Fast" and had a
co-executive producer credit on that film. MGM may have stretched the
truth a bit in an effort to tap into the under-17 male action crowd
that was still in swaddling clothes when McTiernan's 1988 hit "Die
Hard" established him as a commercial action director.</TE>
<TE>   That was just the latest insult to the film's many injuries,
particularly in the relatively new, yet powerful, Internet gossip
universe.</TE>
<TE>   Ain't It Cool News, a Web site that regularly reviews test
screenings, printed several negative reviews of the movie last
spring, the most damning of which was written by the site's founder,
Harry Knowles, who had been personally invited by McTiernan to take
an early peek at the movie.</TE>
<TE>   Knowles had been critical of the film from the script stage on. He
had championed an early draft of the new "Rollerball" that, like
Jewison's original, had been set in a post-apocalyptic future.</TE>
<TE>   "It was an amazing script," Knowles says. "It solved all the
problems of the original." (Knowles owns a 16mm print of the original
film).</TE>
<TE>   When McTiernan (referred to as McT by the MGM staff and his
co-workers) came aboard, he jettisoned that version in favor of a
contemporary story. "My premise was that we didn't have to go off
into never-never land to show a game in which people get hurt so
others can make money," McTiernan said in a recent interview. "I
wanted to project that in the here and now."</TE>
<TE>   In McTiernan's version, three Americans (portrayed by Chris Klein,
LL Cool J and Rebecca Romijn-Stamos) are enlisted by the Russian
Mafia to play the violent sport in the independent nation of
Kazakhstan. "I deliberately chose a faraway place that nobody would
know," says the director, whose decision was made before even
first-graders had memorized all the countries ending with "stan."
(The movie was actually shot in Canada).</TE>
<TE>   Last April, about four months before the then-projected release
date, McTiernan decided to take the bull by the horns and invite
Knowles to a New York test screening of "Rollerball." Unbeknownst to
MGM, he flew Knowles in from Texas on a private jet and put him up at
the Four Seasons Hotel, a move he now admits was "naive."</TE>
<TE>   No parameters were set by McTiernan, says Knowles. The director,
he alleges, said to him, "If you're going to [dump] on my movie, then
at least [dump] on a movie you've seen."</TE>
<TE>   Knowles came to New York. He saw the movie. He eviscerated it. "I
thought he was a nice kid, and I was trying to engage him in the
process," McTiernan says, who dismisses Knowles and the site's impact
on a movie's fortunes as "negligible." While opinions on the Internet
site may not correlate to box-office appeal, the site is faithfully
followed by other media and competing studios, giving them an early
read on upcoming movies. And, after Knowles' slam, word quickly
spread that "Rollerball" was in trouble.</TE>
<TE>   Writing the negative review was not an easy decision, Knowles
acknowledges, since he is a major fan of McTiernan's work, which
includes "Predator" and the recent "The Thomas Crown Affair" (another
remake of a Jewison film). Knowles even likes most of McTiernan's
legendary commercial debacle, "The Last Action Hero."</TE>
<TE>   "The ['Rollerball'] edit I saw was one of the worst films I'd seen
in my life. There was jeering in the theater," Knowles says.</TE>
<TE>   McTiernan and producer Charles Roven remember the screening
somewhat differently. "There were a great many places where the
audience was cheering," Roven says. "There was spontaneous applause a
number of times in the movie."</TE>
<TE>   The producer admits that, at that point, the movie was too long
(more than two hours) and needed some clarification. But that's what
the preview process is for, he says.</TE>
<TE>   Roven has his own explanation for Knowles' downbeat assessment.
"The whole thing was just a set-up," he says. "At that time he and
his Web site were being accused of being co-opted by Hollywood."</TE>
<TE>   In the past the Internet guru has been courted by filmmakers,
including Ron Howard, who invited him to an early screening of "Dr.
Seuss' How the Grinch Stole Christmas," resulting in some laudatory
advance reviews. Knowles doesn't deny that a negative assessment of a
film "would do my career good. But in this case I would rather have
had access to the next five McTiernan projects. This is the guy who
created the modern action movie."</TE>
<TE>   Knowles says he had no covert agenda, and would not have even
written the review if McTiernan had established that as a ground
rule, as has been the case with some other directors who have shown
him movies in the past. The version of "Rollerball" he saw was close
to a finished film, he says, and McTiernan seemed pleased with it. He
suspects the real reason he was invited was that McTiernan may have
been trying to enlist him to persuade MGM to maintain the R rating on
the film. The director has rarely shied away from violence or nudity,
and "Rollerball" was no exception.</TE>
<TE>   At the time all the studios were under increasing pressure in
regard to the marketing of R-rated movies to teenagers and trying to
skirt the issue by cutting back on certain aspects of violence and
sexuality. The pressure only increased after Sept. 11, according to
McTiernan, who says he was not contracted to deliver the film under
any specific rating.</TE>
<TE>   Shortly after the screening last spring, MGM appointed a new head
of marketing and distribution, Robert Levin, who convinced McTiernan
to let go of the summer release slot. This would give the studio more
time to devise a better marketing strategy and allow McTiernan to do
reshoots and to re-edit the film for a PG-13 rating at a more
leisurely pace.</TE>
<TE>   "The release date was coming up on us," Levin says. "When I saw
the movie I had a strong feeling that it would appeal to the under-17
audience and that, while it might do well as an R, it might do even
better as a PG-13."</TE>
<TE>   "Rollerball" was moved to early 2002 and McTiernan shot two weeks
of additional footage last fall to clarify certain scenes, especially
the film's ending. McTiernan trimmed some of the violence and all the
nudity (including a full-frontal shot of Romijn-Stamos). "The
difference is not radical," Roven says.</TE>
<TE>   The new cut of the film, with a running time of about 100 minutes,
was quietly tested and got higher marks, according to Levin. "It has
lots of adrenaline, and young males and even females liked the
movie."</TE>
<TE>   Still, MGM has kept the movie under wraps. While it is only on the
hook for about one-third of the film's cost, officially $60 million
(though other industry sources peg it closer to $80 million), MGM is
trying to maintain an upbeat profile since the recent news that the
company is up for sale.</TE>
<TE>   The studio even had a press junket for the movie without showing
it last weekend, when the "Rollerball" principals participated in
Super Bowl activities in New Orleans and were interviewed mainly by
sports journalists.</TE>
<TE>   The studio had almost slipped "Rollerball" into theaters when the
fracas with Universal Pictures erupted, bringing the movie more bad
press. Another potentially bad stroke of luck is having to contend
with a major rival for the action audience. Warner Bros. recently
moved the delayed Arnold Schwarzenegger terrorism thriller
"Collateral Damage" onto the same release date. Levin says he's not
worried. "Rollerball" is tracking strongest with an under-21 audience
while the Schwarzenegger film is skewing older.</TE>
<TE>   "Rollerball" will have to hit the ground running since there's
more competition next weekend--another action film, "Hart's War"
starring Bruce Willis, also from MGM, and also sporting a hefty
budget (more than $65 million). Levin says he's confident the
audience can expand to accommodate all three films. "I don't think
they'll cannibalize each other. It's our job to make sure they don't
all look like the same movie."</TE>

<HD>'Shared Roots': Two Approaches to Israeli Dance</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LEWIS SEGAL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Inbal Dance Theatre and the Keshet Chaim Dance Ensemble both do
Israeli dance based in religion and folklore, but their "Shared
Roots" program at the University of Judaism over the weekend revealed
as many differences as similarities.</LD>
<LD>   At 52, Inbal is Israel's oldest dance company, and on Sunday, its
passionate, heroic artists emphasized powerful emotions, distinctive
personalities, and the sense that dance is one of the hard-won
pleasures of a harsh and uncertain existence.</LD>
<LD>   Founder Sara Levi-Tanai's narrative "The Story of Ruth" and
company manager Ilana Cohen's impressionistic "Sajarra" may have
looked old-fashioned in their reliance on traditional character-dance
and pantomime, but the movement always came from deep within the
dancers' bodies and that unstinting physical commitment proved
thrilling.</LD>
<TE>   In contrast, the Israeli American Keshet Chaim approach emphasized
nonstop celebration, with choreographers Oded Mansura and artistic
director Eytan Avisar creating bright, brisk show-dance diversions
whether their subject was a Bible tale ("The Queen of Sheba"), a
tribute to Spanish Jewry ("From Spain to Jerusalem") or a depiction
of ancient Yemenite culture suddenly exposed to the modern world
("Immigrants of the Magic Carpet").</TE>
<TE>   A Southland company founded in 1983, Keshet Chaim looked energetic
and well drilled but physically shallow.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to three weekend performances in Gindi Auditorium, the
local Inbal-Keshet Chaim project included classes, workshops and
lecture-demonstrations at the Skirball Cultural Center highlighting
the expression of Jewish culture through dance. Since Inbal's last
U.S. tour took place in 1987 (before Keshet Chaim was founded), its
visit and example might well inspire the younger company to
reconsider the profound movement resources being neglected in its
lightweight style and repertory. Shared roots, yes. Equal impact, no.</TE>

<HD>An Agile Pianist Who Can Make the Minutes Waltz</HD>
<DH>Guy Livingston showcases 60 composers by playing one
60-second snippet by each. His commentary relieves the tension.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARK SWED</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Listening to Guy Livingston play his program "60 Seconds for
Piano"--60 pieces about a minute long--is like being president for an
hour. We stand in a long receiving line to meet and greet 60
composers, and each tries hard to make an immediate impression. It is
not an unpleasant experience, and time flies. But after a while, it
can all seem a blur.</LD>
<LD>   In fact, Monday's recital, the first in a four-part Festival of
Pianos at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art Bing Theater, was less
about these many composers (most of whom are young and unfamiliar)
than about Livingston himself. The 34-year-old pianist from
Tennessee, who lives in Paris, is an exceptionally agile and
charismatic performer with an entrepreneurial flair.</LD>
<LD>   And many of the miniatures--for which a bottle of Jack Daniels was
the commissioning fee--take advantage of his curious but winning
combination of relaxed Southern charm, manic intensity and sense of
humor.</LD>
<TE>   The format was part of the fun. Livingston divided the program
into six sets, each a dazzling kaleidoscope of 10 pieces dashed
through. Between the sets, Livingston relieved the tension by
casually walking over to a leather armchair and offering easygoing
commentary about the program.</TE>
<TE>   Much of his pleasure in the project, he told us, was the discovery
of so many composers not yet introduced to the public. Often, the
pieces came like postcards from near and far, like brief reports
about the wide world. What began as 60 commissions has snowballed
into nearly 200 (many now coming unsolicited). For each program, he
chooses a different selection. The one he chose for his West Coast
debut at the Monday Evening Concerts series included about two-thirds
of those found on his Wergo CD, "Don't Panic!"</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps because so many of the composers do not yet have a public
reputation, the program also became nearly 60 ways to make a splash.
Humor was the most common way, which made for an uncommonly jokey
evening of new music, and most of the works were one-liners. But the
composers also recognized Livingston's brilliant technique and had
his fingers flying. Percussive attacks were also popular.</TE>
<TE>   There was not much new from these composers, but there was variety
and surprise. Dan Warburton, in his "Speed Study 1," made sure
Livingston found his way to all 88 keys in a moment of Boulez-ian
complexity followed by a puckish tonal cadence. Sophie de Wit's "Who
asked you?" had a fondness for Scriabin-like trills, as did Marek
Zebrowksi's "Ex tempore."</TE>
<TE>   Frank Oteri wrote a lovely tango ("Last Minute Tango"), Gene
Pritsker's tango-ish "i'm afraid you might ask for a fragment of my
soul" was more raw.</TE>
<TE>   A few established composers came to the party. William Bolcom's
"60-second Ballet (for chickens)" had virtuoso fun with Tchaikovsky;
Louis Andriessen's "not [an] anfang" was a simple, haunting melody.</TE>
<TE>   Pierre Boulez sent his regrets through an assistant, and the
letter was read as a piece, as if it were one more work of conceptual
art. Others intended their concepts to be performed.</TE>
<TE>   And actress Michelle Munson helped out with Jerome Bourdellon's
Fluxus-style "Ha!" by skating up to the stage with a special delivery
letter; Livingston read it, shouting "ha" loudly inside the piano,
causing the strings to resonate quite beautifully.</TE>
<TE>   Following the example of Henry Cowell or John Cage, other pieces
had Livingston strumming the strings like a harp and tapping on the
closed keyboard like a drum.</TE>
<TE>   Annie Gosfield's "Brooklyn, October 5, 1941" commemorated the
Dodgers blowing the World Series by the pianist rolling baseballs
over the keys to produce interesting clusters. Bernhardt Weidner ("2
homes, 1 garden") obsessively went back and forth between German
Modernism and pop music every couple of seconds. A piece by a
composer's cat, Ketzel Cotel, re-created the delicate sound of paws
on the keys.</TE>
<TE>   The most impressive performance was the last piece, Moritz
Eggert's "Hammerklavier XI," which is made up of 60 one-second
movements--prologue, prelude, one-second waltz, hommage to Glenn
Miller, hymn, toccata, scherzo, requiem, dialogue, pastorale, finale,
epilogue, etc.--and the title of each was called out. It works; it is
a riot; and the performance was an astonishing display of manic
energy and precision.</TE>
<TE>   Eggert is a clever man; many of the composers on the program are
clever men or women. But the last word in this evening was that
Livingston is more than just a clever pianist. He even plays Chopin
well--the encore was the "Minute" Waltz.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Damon Wayans' ABC hit "My Wife and Kids," winner of a People's Choice
Award last month as best new comedy, stretches out with a 60-minute
special episode at 8 tonight. Alas, this isn't the show's finest
hour.</LD>
<LD>   The program has spent most of its first two seasons anchored
solidly in the TV family's upper-middle-class home, taking fresh and
funny angles on its domestic sitcom trappings.</LD>
<LD>   With the hugely talented Wayans as Michael Kyle and Tisha Campbell
Martin as wife Janet presiding over a rambunctious household that
includes teen offspring George O. Gore II as Junior and Jennifer Cole
Freeman as Claire, and Parker McKenna Posey as young daughter Kady,
the show has led some to invoke the C-word (as in "Cosby") in
predicting its long-term potential.</LD>
<TE>   Perhaps. But in tonight's show, "Table for Too Many," the family's
ill-fated outing to a Japanese restaurant may merely leave viewers
hungry for more laughs.</TE>
<TE>   Part of the problem is that every time Wayans gets that
mischievous gleam in his eye, you expect a killer line to spill out.</TE>
<TE>   However, the meager servings of truly mirthful moments just rattle
around in the hourlong framework, unable to sustain the episode's
energy.</TE>
<TE>   Wayans' former "In Living Color" colleague Kelly Coffield Park and
comedian Larry Miller are on hand as the unhappy tablemates of the
Kyles at the Benihana-style restaurant. But the bickering mainly
falls flat, leaving everyone, including the viewer, waiting
impatiently for the check.</TE>

<HD>Slight Gain for Big Game</HD>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A dramatic finish yielded only minor ratings gains for the Super
Bowl, while Fox's "Malcolm in the Middle" fumbled away most of that
audience due in part to its late postgame start, based on viewing
estimates issued Tuesday by Nielsen Media Research.</LD>
<LD>   Viewing of the game rose 3% from last year (the percentage of U.S.
homes tuning in was actually the same, but the population has grown),
as usual dwarfing anything else broadcast on TV this season. Viewers
drifted away, however, during the protracted postgame show, and the
youth-oriented "Malcolm"--which didn't get on the air until 10:52
p.m. Eastern time--fell more than 50% short of post-Super Bowl
viewing of "Survivor" last year.</LD>
<LD>   Insert your own joke here, meanwhile, for NBC's attempt to lure
away viewers with a special Playboy Playmate edition of "Fear Factor"
versus Fox's halftime and postgame coverage. NBC did draw the highest
young-adult rating for any network against the Super Bowl in eight
years, but the ratings were still modest.</LD>
<TE>   On Friday, an interview with Celine Dion helped "20/20" belt out
its biggest audience in 10 months, though the newsmagazine still
trailed NBC's "Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit" in its time slot.
ABC also received a lift from "Stephen King's Rose Red," which
finished its three-night run as the highest-rated miniseries since
King's "Storm of the Century" in 1999.</TE>

<LD>These simply grilled pork chops are glazed with a spiced honey. The
roasted red pepper sauce is just spicy enough to pair with the sweet
glaze. And the salad is unusual in that the thinnest
slices--shavings, actually--of fennel, onion, carrot and apple are
tossed in a lemony mustard dressing.</LD>
<LD>   Add roasted fingerling potatoes for a great meal.</LD>
<LD>   These recipes come from chef Bruce Sherman of North Pond Cafe in
Chicago. Sherman is known for his creative touch in the kitchen,
especially with seasonal ingredients.</LD>

<TE>   Grilled Pork Chops With Spiced Honey Glaze</TE>
<TE>   Active Work Time: 15 minutes * Total Preparation Time: 45 minutes</TE>
<TE>   The honey sauce makes about 1 cup; you'll have about 3/4 to 1/2
cup leftover for other uses. Serve this with Roasted Red Pepper
Sauce.</TE>
<TE>   1 cup wildflower honey</TE>
<TE>   1 1/2 teaspoons coriander seeds</TE>
<TE>   1 teaspoon fennel seeds</TE>
<TE>   5 cardamom pods</TE>
<TE>   4 cloves</TE>
<TE>   3 tablespoons Sherry vinegar</TE>
<TE>   6 (10-ounce) center-cut pork loin chops</TE>
<TE>   3 tablespoons oil</TE>
<TE>   Salt, pepper</TE>
<TE>   Combine the honey, coriander seeds, fennel seeds, cardamom pods
and cloves in a saucepan (the honey will boil over in a small
saucepan). Gently bring to a boil. Reduce the heat and simmer until
the honey becomes dark amber-colored, about 15 to 20 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   Remove from the heat. Carefully pour the vinegar into the pot to
avoid splattering. Stir well. Pour the mixture through a sieve to
remove the spices and discard them. Set aside the honey at room
temperature.</TE>
<TE>   Heat the grill. Lightly brush both sides of the pork chops with
the oil. Generously season with salt and pepper. Grill the chops over
a hot fire, turning as necessary, until they're no longer pink in the
center, about 8 minutes a side. Remove them to a serving platter.</TE>
<TE>   Serve warm, brushing both sides of the chops with the honey glaze.
Top with the Roasted Red Pepper Sauce.</TE>

<TE>   Roasted Red Bell Pepper Sauce</TE>
<TE>   Active Work and Total Preparation Time: 20 minutes</TE>
<TE>   2 red bell peppers</TE>
<TE>   1 tablespoon olive oil</TE>
<TE>   1 shallot, thinly sliced</TE>
<TE>   1 clove garlic, chopped</TE>
<TE>   1 jalapeno, seeded and chopped</TE>
<TE>   Salt</TE>
<TE>   Freshly ground pepper</TE>
<TE>   1 plum tomato, chopped</TE>
<TE>   1 tablespoon honey</TE>
<TE>   1/4 cup white wine vinegar</TE>
<TE>   1/2 cup low-sodium chicken or vegetable stock</TE>
<TE>   1/4 cup (1/2 stick) unsalted butter, cubed and chilled</TE>
<TE>   Heat the grill or broiler.</TE>
<TE>   Cut the flat sides off the peppers in slabs. Arrange them in a
single layer on the grill or 4 inches beneath the broiler, skin side
to the heat. Roast until blackened, about 10 minutes. Wrap the
peppers in foil. When they're cool enough to handle, about 15
minutes, remove the skin and discard. Coarsely chop the peppers and
set them aside.</TE>
<TE>   Heat the oil in a heavy saucepan over medium heat. Add the
shallot, garlic, jalapeno and salt and pepper to taste. Cook,
stirring often, until they soften slightly, about 3 minutes. Do not
brown.</TE>
<TE>   Add the chopped tomato; turn the heat to high. Stir until most of
the moisture evaporates, about 2 minutes. Add the peppers and the
honey; mix well. Stir in the vinegar and cook until the liquid is
reduced by two-thirds, 1 to 2 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   Add the stock. Gently bring to a boil, reduce the heat to low and
simmer for 5 minutes. Remove from the heat, let cool slightly, place
in a blender and puree until smooth. Strain the sauce through a fine
mesh sieve. (This can be made 2 days ahead and refrigerated. To
serve, gently reheat in a medium saucepan.) Return to the saucepan.
Whisk in the butter, 1 piece at a time, until melted. Taste; adjust
seasoning. Serve hot.</TE>

<TE>   Fennel, Carrot and Apple Slaw</TE>
<TE>   Active Work and Total Preparation Time: 20 minutes * Vegetarian</TE>
<TE>   DRESSING</TE>
<TE>   1/4 cup lemon juice</TE>
<TE>   2 teaspoons water</TE>
<TE>   1 teaspoon honey</TE>
<TE>   1 teaspoon whole-grain mustard</TE>
<TE>   1 small clove garlic, finely minced</TE>
<TE>   1/4 teaspoon salt</TE>
<TE>   Freshly ground white pepper</TE>
<TE>   1/2 cup oil</TE>
<TE>   Whisk the lemon juice, water, honey, mustard, garlic, salt and
pepper to taste in a small bowl. Gradually whisk in the oil. Taste;
adjust seasoning (a dressing should be well-seasoned). Set aside up
to 2 hours at room temperature.</TE>
<TE>   SLAW</TE>
<TE>   1/4 cup sliced almonds</TE>
<TE>   1 small mild onion</TE>
<TE>   1 fennel bulb, trimmed</TE>
<TE>   3 carrots</TE>
<TE>   1 apple</TE>
<TE>   2 tablespoons lemon juice</TE>
<TE>   1 tablespoon chopped parsley</TE>
<TE>   1 tablespoon minced chives</TE>
<TE>   Heat the oven to 350 degrees. Spread the almonds on a baking sheet
and toast until lightly browned, about 8 minutes. Set them aside.</TE>
<TE>   Cut the onion and fennel in half through the roots. Place them
flat on a cutting board. Using a very sharp knife or vegetable
slicer, cut each across in paper-thin crescent slices. Place the
slices in a bowl of ice water to cover. Soak up to 2 hours.</TE>
<TE>   Cut the carrots in half lengthwise. Use a vegetable slicer, peeler
or sharp knife to cut them into thin shavings. Place in a large bowl.</TE>
<TE>   Quarter the apple through the core; remove the core. Place the
apple on a cutting board; cut into paper-thin slices. Add to the
bowl. Toss with the lemon juice. (This can rest up to 1 hour,
refrigerated.)</TE>
<TE>   To serve, strain the fennel and onion and drain well. Add to the
bowl with the apple and carrots. Add just enough reserved dressing to
coat the vegetables (use the excess for other salads and vegetables).
Add the chopped parsley and chives. Toss until mixed. Taste, adjust
seasoning. Transfer to a shallow bowl; sprinkle the top with the
almonds. Serve immediately.</TE>

<HD>The Taste of Tet</HD>
<DH>It wouldn't be the New Year without kho, the ultimate
Vietnamese comfort food.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ANDREA Q. NGUYEN / Special to the Times</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>For many people, Vietnamese cuisine means a big bowl of pho and a
couple of spring rolls, those delicious and ubiquitous standards of
noodle shops and takeout joints. But for folks like me--raised and
fed by Vietnamese parents--the salty-sweet flavors of a
mahogany-colored kho dish best capture the Vietnamese food
experience.</LD>
<LD>   And as the Tet lunar New Year celebration approaches--it begins
Tuesday--I've got kho on my mind.</LD>
<LD>   Kho dishes occupy a central spot in the Vietnamese culinary
consciousness. In fact, it's hard to be Viet without serving and/or
eating kho at your table. Growing up in San Clemente, my cultural
heritage was reinforced at dinnertime. While my friends dove into
tuna casseroles, I spooned my mother's heady kho into bowls of white
rice.</LD>
<TE>   For traditionalists like my parents, who spent most of their lives
in Vietnam, kho remains an integral part of their daily routine.
Whenever I go to their house, there's a kho cooking on the stove or
sitting in the fridge, just waiting to be served.</TE>
<TE>   What exactly is kho? As a noun, kho means a type of dish that is
the ultimate in Vietnamese comfort food--a stew in which the delicate
sweetness of a light caramel offsets the vibrant saltiness of fish
sauce.</TE>
<TE>   Aside from being a whole category of food, kho is also a verb that
means to simmer, braise or stew something. In the main, when someone
says, "I'm kho-ing something," you can bet that they're cooking up
home-style food in a caramel-based sauce.</TE>
<TE>   Originally, kho (pronounced "kaw") dishes were made by simmering
meat, seafood or tofu with fish sauce, sugar and water in clay pots.
Most modern Vietnamese cooks use metal saucepans and employ nuoc mau
("nook mao"), a caramel sauce that deepens the overall color and
flavor. Literally it means "colored water." In the north, people call
the same ingredient nuoc hang ("nook hahng"), literally
"merchandising water," probably because it was so often used by food
hawkers to enhance the appearance of their wares.</TE>
<TE>   A typical Vietnamese meal consists of rice, kho, a stir-fry and
soup. "You can leave out the stir-fry and the soup, but you can't
forget the kho," my dad says. "There's always plenty of rice, and you
have to eat it with something salty."</TE>
<TE>   To prepare a basic kho dish, you simply place all the ingredients
in a saucepan and let them cook until the meat juices have exuded and
combined well with the other elements, and the overall color is as
reddish-brown as dark honey. Creative cooks can doll things up by
grilling or briefly sauteing the meat or fish before simmering it
with the caramel sauce and other ingredients. If it isn't naturally
present, a little fat or oil is added for richness.</TE>
<TE>   Though the color darkens slightly overnight, kho dishes reheat
beautifully, so Vietnamese cooks often prepare large quantities with
leftovers in mind.</TE>
<TE>   Kho dishes originated before refrigeration was available in
Vietnam and cooks needed to preserve food to accompany the mainstay
of their diet, rice. To that end, they infused food with the
saltiness of fish sauce, their beloved condiment. But things cooked
in pure fish sauce were overly salty, so sugar was added to balance
the flavor.</TE>
<TE>   Still, the color wasn't quite right, so they started experimenting
and eventually adopted the practice of caramelizing the sugar into an
inky, bittersweet sauce (think black coffee or molasses). Diluted
during cooking, the dark red cast of this caramel sauce imparts a
beautiful color. The use of nuoc mau negated the need to add sugar to
the sauce, though some cooks still do. The caramel's bittersweet edge
also helps counter the saltiness of the fish sauce and brings out the
savory aspects of whatever is being cooked.</TE>
<TE>   A kho made with a caramel-based sauce is rich in flavor and lush
in texture. Because kho is such an important part of a Vietnamese
cook's repertoire, nuoc mau is a staple in the Vietnamese kitchen,
where it's made in large batches and stored in a jar, usually kept in
the cupboard. Just spoon some into a saucepan with all the other
ingredients and you're ready to go. Some cooks add ginger, hot chile
peppers, galangal or whole peppercorns for extra pizazz.</TE>
<TE>   As with any dish that is so simple, the quality of the ingredients
is important. Fish sauce, in particular, varies depending on the
manufacturer and country of origin. Tiparos brand, which is widely
available, is produced in the Thai style, which means that it's
heavier and saltier. Vietnamese-style fish sauce (Viet Huong/3 Crabs
is my favorite brand--it's made in Thailand but to the Vietnamese
taste) is lighter and a bit sweet because some fructose is usually
added.</TE>
<TE>   Traditional Vietnamese cooks such as my mother keep a Tiparos-type
of fish sauce around for cooking (it's cheaper) and use the more
delicate Vietnamese-style fish sauce ("more expensive" at about $2.49
a bottle) to make their dipping sauces.</TE>
<TE>   It's like the differences between grades of olive oil and how they
may be used in different applications. If I had to choose only one
brand of fish sauce to keep in my kitchen, I'd go for the 3 Crabs;
it's widely available in Chinese, pan-Asian and Vietnamese markets.
Vietnam is exporting some good stuff these days too, like Pigeon
brand, which is primarily available at Vietnamese markets.</TE>
<TE>   Most kho dishes can be made very quickly. The pork riblets are an
exception--they're marinated and then broiled or grilled before
simmering, which gives them a wonderfully complex roastiness at the
price of more time. Still, I kho these riblets around Tet every year
as a reminder of the traditional festivities (surrounding the annual
slaughter of a pig), which can go on for weeks.</TE>
<TE>   Since you're supposed to avoid work and have fun during Tet, my
mother's family would kho their pork ribs for eating throughout the
celebration alongside other traditional foods. With the Year of the
Horse starting Tuesday, I'm rounding up my riblets and reaching for
my jar of caramel sauce.</TE>

<TE>   Caramel Sauce (Nuoc Mau)</TE>
<TE>   Active Work Time: 5 minutes * Total Preparation Time: 35 minutes</TE>
<TE>   The traditional method of making this sauce requires that you add
boiling water to the caramelized sugar, which kicks off a dramatic
reaction that's not for the faint of heart. The point of doing this
is to arrest the cooking process so that the sugar doesn't burn to a
bitter black stage. I find it easier to place the pan bottom in a
sink filled with water. This cools the caramel down so that when you
add the remaining water, there's little drama left. The result of
both approaches is the same bittersweet inky sauce that's a staple in
every Vietnamese kitchen.</TE>
<TE>   1 cup sugar</TE>
<TE>   3/4 cup water, divided</TE>
<TE>   Fill the sink with enough water to come halfway up the side of a
1-quart, heavy-bottomed saucepan. Place the sugar and 1/4 cup of the
water into the saucepan and cook over medium-low heat. Stir until the
sugar dissolves, about 2 to 3 minutes. As the sugar melts, the
mixture will go from opaque to clear. Small bubbles will form at the
edge and gradually grow larger, moving toward the center of the pan.
Eventually, bubbles will cover the entire surface.</TE>
<TE>   After about 15 minutes, the sugar will begin to caramelize and
turn in color. You'll see a progression from champagne yellow to
light tea to dark tea. When smoke starts rising, remove the saucepan
from the heat and slowly swirl it around. Watch the sugar closely as
it will turn darker by the second; a reddish cast will set in (think
the color of a big and bold red wine) as the bubbles become a lovely
burnt orange. Pay attention to the color of the caramel underneath
the bubbles. When the caramel color is that of black coffee or
molasses, place the pan in the sink to stop the cooking process. The
hot pan bottom will sizzle upon contact and the bubble action will
subside.</TE>
<TE>   Add the remaining 1/2 cup of water (there may be a small dramatic
reaction) and place the saucepan back on the stove over medium heat,
stirring until the caramel has dissolved into the water. The result
will be slightly viscous; flavor-wise, it will be bittersweet. Pour
the caramel sauce into a small glass jar and let it cool; it will
thicken further. Store indefinitely in your kitchen cupboard.</TE>

<TE>   Chicken and Ginger in Caramel Sauce (Ga Kho)</TE>
<TE>   Active Work Time: 10 minutes * Total Preparation Time: 30 minutes</TE>
<TE>   This is a very straightforward northern Vietnamese preparation.
I've read recipes from the central and southern Vietnamese regions
that include garlic and chiles, and that saute the chicken with
aromatics before simmering. While there's bound to be more complex
flavors in those versions, the beauty of this recipe lies in its
simplicity. This preparation shows off the ease of making a kho dish
and the delectability of the results.</TE>
<TE>   The chicken exudes its juices during cooking, which adds extra
savoriness to the sauce. The ginger softens and mellows, blending in
with the other ingredients while still retaining its jolting quality.
To crush the ginger, place the flat side of a knife blade on each
slice and give the blade a firm whack with the palm of your hand.
Crushing the ginger releases more of its juices during cooking,
thereby mitigating its bite.</TE>
<TE>   Traditionally, the chicken was left on the bone with the skin
attached. You'd cut the chicken pieces up and simmer the ingredients
into an unctuous kho. My mother used to simmer chicken wings and what
I jokingly called "chicken knees" (the bony knob ends of the
drumsticks that she'd cut off as she butchered chickens and save in
the freezer). For the sake of ease and health considerations, I now
use boneless skinless chicken thighs.</TE>
<TE>   1 1/2 pounds boneless, skinless chicken thighs, cut into 1-inch
chunks</TE>
<TE>   1 (2-inch) piece ginger root, peeled, thinly sliced into
quarter-size coins and crushed</TE>
<TE>   3 tablespoons Caramel Sauce</TE>
<TE>   2 tablespoons fish sauce</TE>
<TE>   1/4 teaspoon salt</TE>
<TE>   2 tablespoons water</TE>
<TE>   1 green onion, green tops only, chopped</TE>
<TE>   Steamed rice, for serving</TE>
<TE>   Place the chicken, ginger, Caramel Sauce, fish sauce, salt and
water into a saucepan. Give a stir to distribute everything. Cover
and bring to a strong simmer over medium heat. Stir again to break up
the chicken pieces, then replace the lid. Cook for 10 minutes,
periodically stirring to evenly expose the chicken to the sauce. The
kho will send fragrant steam out from under the lid. The sauce will
increase in volume as the chicken releases its juices.</TE>
<TE>   After the 10 minutes are up, remove the lid and continue cooking
to reduce the sauce and deepen the color to a rich reddish brown,
about 5 minutes. Replace the lid and allow it to rest for 5 minutes.
Taste the sauce and adjust the flavor with extra fish sauce, if
necessary. Garnish with the chopped green onion and serve with plenty
of rice.</TE>

<TE>   Shrimp in Caramel Sauce (Tom Kho)</TE>
<TE>   Active Work Time: 15 minutes * Total Preparation Time: 25 minutes</TE>
<TE>   This simple dish exemplifies how the Vietnamese kho method of
cooking sends an already tasty ingredient such as shrimp into a new
dimension. Nowadays, it seems uncouth to overcook seafood. However,
in this application, the longer cooking allows all the flavors to
thoroughly penetrate the shrimp. Unlike other kho dishes, this recipe
doesn't ask you to sweat the juices out by covering the pan with a
lid; shrimp is delicate and requires faster "open" cooking to
concentrate the flavors. The onions should practically disintegrate
into the sauce. Adding the oil at the end lends a bit of extra
richness; traditionally more lard or oil was added than prescribed
here to also give an appetizing sheen to the shrimp.</TE>
<TE>   This may seem like a lot of shrimp for four, but I've observed my
friends snap these guys up like crazy, sometimes even eating them
without rice.</TE>
<TE>   1 1/2 pounds medium shrimp (31-40 count), peeled and deveined</TE>
<TE>   1/4 teaspoon salt</TE>
<TE>   1 1/2 tablespoons fish sauce</TE>
<TE>   2 tablespoons Caramel Sauce</TE>
<TE>   1/2 yellow onion, thinly sliced</TE>
<TE>   1/2 teaspoon freshly ground pepper</TE>
<TE>   1 1/2 tablespoons oil</TE>
<TE>   1 green onion, green tops only, chopped</TE>
<TE>   Steamed rice, for serving</TE>
<TE>   Place the shrimp, salt, fish sauce and Caramel Sauce into a
shallow saucepan. Bring to a vigorous simmer over high heat. Add the
yellow onion and pepper, stirring to evenly distribute. Continue
cooking over high heat, occasionally turning the shrimp so that
they're well coated with sauce. They'll curl up and release their
juices to combine with the other ingredients and concentrate into a
dark sauce. Add a little water if things get too dry.</TE>
<TE>   The shrimp are done when they've taken on an orange-brown color
and have a pleasant sweet chewiness, about 8 to 10 minutes after
you've added the onion and pepper. There will be a few tablespoons of
sauce in the pan. Remove from the heat, add the oil and stir to coat
the shrimp. Scatter the green onion on top and serve with lots of
steamed rice.</TE>

<TE>   Pork Riblets Simmered in Caramel Sauce (Suon Kho)</TE>
<TE>   Active Work Time: 15 minutes * Total Preparation Time: 1  1/2
hours plus 2 hours marinating</TE>
<TE>   Traditionally, the riblets were grilled over charcoal to sear in
the flavors before simmering. In our family, we take an easier route
by broiling them. I've presented all the options below. Here are some
additional things to note: Ask a butcher to cut the ribs, as this is
not an easy home project. To remove the fat, the ribs may be prepared
a day ahead and refrigerated. The congealed fat can be easily lifted
off the surface. The onions may be prepped in a mini-chopper.</TE>
<TE>   2 pounds meaty pork spareribs, cut crosswise through the bone into
2-inch-wide strips</TE>
<TE>   1/3 cup minced, grated or pureed yellow onion, about 1/2 small
onion</TE>
<TE>   1 tablespoon sugar</TE>
<TE>   3/4 teaspoon freshly ground pepper</TE>
<TE>   1/4 cup fish sauce, divided</TE>
<TE>   1/4 cup Caramel Sauce</TE>
<TE>   1 green onion, green top only, chopped</TE>
<TE>   Steamed rice, for serving</TE>
<TE>   Cut each rib strip between the bones or through the cartilage into
individual riblets. Combine the onion, sugar, pepper and 2
tablespoons of the fish sauce in a bowl. Add the riblets, cover with
plastic wrap and marinate in the refrigerator for at least 2 hours or
overnight.</TE>
<TE>   If necessary, adjust your broiler rack so that the ribs will cook
as close to the flame as possible. Heat the broiler for 30 minutes to
get it nice and hot.</TE>
<TE>   While the broiler heats up, take the ribs from the refrigerator
and let them sit at room temperature to take the chill off. Place
them on a baking sheet and broil until they're tinged brown, about 4
to 6 minutes per side; a little charring is fine. (You'll hear a
pleasant sizzle as this happens.) Alternatively, cook the ribs over
high heat on a gas or charcoal grill, which imparts deeper flavor.
The point here is to sear the riblets to obtain a roastiness and
intensify the overall color.</TE>
<TE>   Place the riblets in a saucepan with the Caramel Sauce, the
remaining 2 tablespoons of fish sauce and enough water (about 2 1/2
cups) to cover most of the riblets. Bring to a boil and reduce the
heat to simmer. Cover and let cook for 40 minutes; the ribs should
simmer vigorously, sending steam out from under the lid.</TE>
<TE>   Remove the lid and continue to simmer until the ribs are tender
(you can easily pierce the meat with a fork or knife tip), about 20
to 30 minutes. If there's cartilage, you should be able to bite
through it, with a slight crunch remaining. This latter phase of
cooking allows the sauce to reduce and concentrate in flavor, and
deepens the color to dark reddish brown. In the end, there should be
a fair amount of sauce left.</TE>
<TE>   Turn off the heat, tilt the saucepan so the liquid goes to one
side and use a spoon or small ladle to skim the fat from the top.
Adjust the flavors with extra fish sauce, if necessary. Garnish with
the chopped green onion and serve with lots of steamed rice.</TE>
<TE>   4 servings. Each serving, without rice: 429 calories; 773 mg
sodium; 104 mg cholesterol; 26 grams fat; 9 grams saturated fat; 20

<LD>It may interest your readers that the Swabian version of rivels ("I
Love That Spotsy Soup, Lumps and All," Jan. 30) is even more
practical because it needs no milk. Only water is added. Or it can be
made with eggs only. The authentic version is scraped from a wooden
board with a metal scraper (spatzenschaber) or a knife into the
boiling water. There are many delightful recipes that use it, such as
the soup-like Gaisburger Marsch or the Schinken und Kaesespatzen, a
specialty of the Algau, the mountainous area of southern Germany.</LD>

<TE>   I love spaetzle and remember my sister and I going downtown to the
Boston Store in Chicago for a dinner of chicken paprikash mit
spaetzel during World War II. Often when I have no noodles for soup,
when the soup is about ready I beat an egg and salt and press enough
flour into the egg to make a hard ball. Then I grate the noodles into
the boiling soup. When it gets sticky, just add a little more flour.
Works for me.</TE>

<LD>The bells of empathy must surely ring loud in the land for Emily
Green's "Making the Perfect Kitchen" (Jan. 19). For lo, these many
years have I clipped Food section recipes (jumbled together in shoe
boxes behind the telephone directories), but never before have I been
moved to preserve for posterity a cookbook critique. I may even frame
it (if I can find room on my ancient fridge door).</LD>

<LD>Thanks for your article about pot roast ("The Simple Pot Roast Hits
the Big Time," Jan. 23). I inherited my grandmother's heavy cast iron
braising pan. Everything I cook in it is delicious (friends say
exceptional!), but I've never had anything as delicious as the pot
roast at Jar. A friend took me there last weekend--too noisy, too
crowded for me, I'm afraid. But once I tasted the pot roast, the
outside world faded away. Thanks for the recipes in the article. If
anything can attempt to do justice to Jar's recipe and technique, my
grandmother's pan can.</LD>

<LD>Choucroute garnie is French for sauerkraut baked with sausages and
potatoes. Traditional choucroute is usually made with goose fat,
sausages, pork and ham and is wonderfully full of flavor. But a
serving can top 900 calories and have almost 70 grams of fat.</LD>
<LD>   I wanted a lower-fat version that I could enjoy more often. This
recipe eliminates the high-fat sausages, using lower-fat turkey and
chicken sausage instead. There's no goose fat, just a small amount of
oil to saute the onions, carrot and garlic. And the casserole is
baked in low-fat chicken broth and a small amount of white wine.</LD>
<LD>   The finished dish is full of flavor and one of substance. Serve it
with French bread and a crunchy salad.</LD>
<TE>   Choucroute With Turkey Sausages</TE>
<TE>   Active Work Time: 15 minutes * Total Preparation Time: 1 hour 45
minutes</TE>
<TE>   1 (1-pound) can sauerkraut, drained and rinsed</TE>
<TE>   Nonstick cooking spray</TE>
<TE>   2 teaspoons oil</TE>
<TE>   1 cup chopped onions</TE>
<TE>   1/2 cup shredded carrot</TE>
<TE>   1 clove garlic, minced</TE>
<TE>   1/2 (1-pound) ring turkey smoked sausage</TE>
<TE>   1/2 (1-pound) package chicken and apple mini-sausage</TE>
<TE>   1 cup low-sodium chicken broth</TE>
<TE>   1/2 cup dry white wine</TE>
<TE>   12 small red potatoes</TE>
<TE>   Salt, pepper</TE>
<TE>   Heat the oven to 325 degrees. Place the sauerkraut in a 3-quart,
deep casserole; set aside.</TE>
<TE>   Spray a nonstick skillet with nonstick cooking spray. Add the oil
and heat over medium heat until hot. Add the onions and cook until
tender and lightly browned, about 5 minutes. Add the carrot and
garlic and continue to cook until the carrots are tender, 2 minutes.
Add the vegetables to the sauerkraut.</TE>
<TE>   Cut the turkey and chicken sausages into 12 pieces each and add to
the sauerkraut. Add the broth, wine and potatoes. Season to taste
with salt and pepper.</TE>
<TE>   Cover the casserole and bake 1 hour. Uncover and bake until just
starting to brown, about 30 minutes.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>This recipe comes from a wildly successful cookbook written in 1902
called "Mrs. Rorer's New Cookbook." It was written by Sara Tyson
Rorer, who was respected for her tasty dishes.</LD>
<LD>   When I tried this, she didn't disappoint me. Of Spanish Rice With
Chicken, she wrote, "If this dish is properly cooked and seasoned, it
is delicious."</LD>
<LD>   True. Rice is one of the oldest staple foods. Very nourishing and
simple to cook, it is a fine companion with fish, meat, chicken and
of course, leftovers. Use long-grain white rice for this recipe.</LD>
<TE>   Spanish Rice With Chicken</TE>
<TE>   Active Work Time: 10 minutes * Total Preparation Time: 45 minutes</TE>
<TE>   2 1/2 cups water</TE>
<TE>   1 (14 1/2-ounce) can tomatoes with juice</TE>
<TE>   3 pounds chicken pieces, such as thighs, legs and breasts (if
large, cut in half)</TE>
<TE>   1 teaspoon dried red pepper flakes</TE>
<TE>   2 large onions, chopped</TE>
<TE>   1 teaspoon salt</TE>
<TE>   Freshly ground pepper</TE>
<TE>   1 cup chopped parsley</TE>
<TE>   1 cup rice</TE>
<TE>   Place the water, tomatoes with juice, chicken, red pepper flakes,
onions, salt and pepper to taste in a heavy-bottomed pot with a lid.
Bring to a boil and immediately reduce the heat to a simmer. Simmer
20 minutes and turn the chicken pieces over. Add more tomato juice or
water if too much liquid is evaporating and the chicken is drying
out.</TE>
<TE>   Add the parsley and rice. Be sure there are 2 cups of liquid in
the pot; if not, add more tomato juice or water. Stir until the
ingredients are well mixed. Cover and simmer until the rice is tender
and the liquid is absorbed, 15 minutes more, checking once or twice
to make sure all the liquid hasn't been absorbed by the rice. It
should be quite moist, not soupy. (Add some boiling water if it has
become dry.) Taste and add more salt and pepper, if needed. Serve
hot.</TE>

<LD>Rich in small local growers offering top-quality organic produce, the
12-year-old Ojai farmers market compares, stall for stall, with the
best markets in the Southland.</LD>
<LD>   In winter especially, the market's glory is citrus. Among local
growers Sunday, Jim Churchill and his wife, Lisa Brenneis, had round,
deep oranges and very flavorful Page mandarins; bizarre Buddha's Hand
citrons, which look like a cross between a lemon and a squid; bland,
low-acid Millsweet limettas, often called sweet lemons; and gorgeous
Fuerte avocados, now at peak quality.</LD>
<LD>   For Friend's Ranches, Elsie Jones, an 84-year-old lifelong Ojai
resident, sold excellent Washington navel oranges and juicy,
tender-fleshed Tarocco blood oranges, which are lighter in color than
the standard Moro variety, but well worth seeking out.</LD>
<TE>   Rod Sellars had Dancy mandarins with intense, classic tangerine
aroma and flavor. Robin Smith and her daughter Betty offered
ultra-rare bergamots, from a hybrid of sour orange and lime
historically grown in Calabria, Italy for its exquisite rind oil,
used in scenting eau de cologne and Earl Grey tea. They also had
surpassingly sour Eustis limequats; sweet, custardy white sapotes;
giant red beets; and rutabagas.</TE>
<TE>   From a family who call themselves the Hots, Frank MacDoran and his
stepdaughter, Sara Schaeffer, displayed ferocious dried Purira, Thai
and habanero hot peppers, habanero powder, extract of chile pepper
("use it for hot sauce or for animal repellent," they said) and
colorful Australian Yellowleaf and Outredgeous lettuces.</TE>
<TE>   Robert Dautsch of Carpinteria offered three forms of kale (green,
Red Russian and iridescent Dinosaur); superb, pristine lettuces
(redleaf, romaine, butter and Winter Density); fragrant rosemary; and
a mountain of fresh fenugreek. The stand was so popular that most
items sold out by 11 a.m. Givens Organic Farm of Santa Barbara had
leeks, carrots, dill, red chard, celery and shelling peas.</TE>
<TE>   From further afield, Nancy Rydell of Paso Robles brought crunchy,
flavorful Pink Lady apples, and the Four Apostles stand sold luscious
Medjool dates.</TE>

<LD>Whatever you're grilling, marinades have a reputation for taking
hours--or at least too much time when you're hungry. That's not the
case with these shrimp. Just a quick 10- to 15-minute soak in citrus
juices gives the shrimp needed moisture during the grilling process,
as well as adding flavor.</LD>
<LD>   Serve the shrimp with sticky rice. Use a medium-grain rice such as
Calrose, and be sure you follow the directions on the package--you
don't want the rice to turn out like wallpaper paste. Also, a bite of
rice will help subdue the kick you'll get from the chile-garlic glaze
on the shrimp.</LD>

<TE>   Active Work Time: 15 minutes * Total Prep Time: 30 minutes</TE>
<TE>   Chile garlic sauce can be found in the Asian aisle of most
supermarkets.</TE>
<TE>   1/2 cup grapefruit juice</TE>
<TE>   1/4 cup lime juice</TE>
<TE>   2 tablespoons olive oil</TE>
<TE>   6 green onions</TE>
<TE>   1 dozen medium shrimp, peeled and deveined</TE>
<TE>   Salt, pepper</TE>
<TE>   1 tablespoon chile garlic sauce</TE>
<TE>   2 teaspoons honey</TE>
<TE>   1 teaspoon minced cilantro</TE>
<TE>   Combine the grapefruit juice, lime juice and olive oil in an
11x7-inch glass dish. Set aside.</TE>
<TE>   Cut the root ends off the green onions and trim most of the green
tops, leaving about 1 1/2 inches of the white part with some green at
the top.</TE>
<TE>   Thread the shrimp and the green onions on 2 (10-inch) skewers in
this order: 1 shrimp, 1 green onion, 2 shrimp, 1 green onion, 2
shrimp, 1 green onion, 1 shrimp. When skewering the shrimp, make sure
the skewer pierces the shrimp twice, once in the large end and once
in the small end. Season the skewers with salt and pepper and place
them in the marinade for 10 to 15 minutes, turning them over every
few minutes.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile heat the grill or a well-seasoned indoor grill pan over
medium-high heat. Make the glaze by combining the garlic sauce and
honey in a small bowl. Mix well and have a brush ready for grilling.</TE>
<TE>   Grill the skewers until the shrimp are pink and brown around the
edges and no longer translucent, 1 to 2 minutes a side. Brush with
the glaze while grilling. Sprinkle with cilantro and serve.</TE>

sushi, and I like stuff that is spicy, like Thai food. So I find
myself drinking Pinot Gris and sparkling wine. Those are two wines
that go great with spicy stuff, Pacific Rim food. One that was good
was a New Zealand Pinot Gris, the 2001 Villa Maria. It has enough
acidity and bite without being too harsh to marry well with the
food."</LD>

<HD>A Buyer's Guide to Rosewater</HD>

<LD>Today you're not likely to taste rosewater outside of Middle Eastern
sweets such as baklava. That doesn't mean you can't get it--Indian,
Persian and Armenian markets generally carry it, as do the ethnic
food sections in many supermarkets.</LD>
<LD>   The most widely available brand seems to be Cortas, which has an
excellent fresh rose flavor. Another Lebanese brand, Sadaf, is
similar but perhaps less intense.</LD>
<LD>   The Iranian brand Rezaeyeh is closest to what some Americans fear
rosewater will be--it smells a bit like rose-scented soap or hand
lotion, probably because it's made from rose concentrate. Another
Iranian rosewater, Golchin, is a mixture of rosewater and rose
essence; there's a honeyed note in its scent.</LD>
<TE>   Rosewater is nearly always made from the damask rose (Rosa
damascena), a highly aromatic old variety rarely grown in gardens
today because of the modern taste for showy blossoms. The Pakistani
brand Ahmed is unusual in being made from the cabbage rose (R.
centifolia), the variety beloved by 17th century Dutch painters, so
it has a distinctly different sort of rose scent.</TE>
<TE>   Persian stores may also stock a water called ab-e nastaran, which
is made from the eglantine or sweetbrier rose. You can detect
something roselike in its briery, leather-like scent, but this is
really a medicinal water, not one for cooking.</TE>

<HD>The Surprising Scent of America's Past</HD>
<DH>Before vanilla, it was always rosewater.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHARLES PERRY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Vanilla, plain vanilla--it's the flavor Americans just can't object
to. We smell it and we think of comfortable home cooking. Rosewater,
though, is strange and exotic. Many even find it oddly revolting in
food.</LD>
<LD>   It's lucky for rosewater haters that time travel hasn't been
invented, because they'd find rosewater all over the place in America
(and most of Europe as well) right up till the middle of the 19th
century. It's in the very first American cookbook, Amelia Simmons'
"American Cookery" (1796). Simmons put rosewater in bread pudding and
poundcake, even in apple pie and gingerbread.</LD>
<LD>   Roses have a charming aroma, of course. But centuries ago,
rosewater's special charm was the simple fact that you didn't have to
buy it. The home cook could make her own in the "still-room" where
she made the family's liqueurs and medicines. It didn't need a lot of
special equipment. You could just boil rose petals and use the water.</LD>
<TE>   Its traditional home was in puddings, cakes and custards, though
it could show up in just about any sweet--one 1755 English cookbook
put rosewater in "whafles" and an American-style pumpkin pie. Like
almonds, it had been a favorite ingredient in the Middle Ages, and
rosewater and almonds still kept company well into the 19th century.
Cookbooks often warned that when you're grinding almonds, you should
always add a little rosewater to keep them from oiling.</TE>
<TE>   But taste was slowly abandoning rosewater. Wine and brandy started
elbowing it aside in the late 18th century, and cookbooks began
calling for them where you might have expected rosewater. Still, two
of the most popular cookbooks of mid-19th century America, Eliza
Leslie's "Directions for Cookery" (1837) and Sarah Rutledge's "The
Carolina Housewife" (1847), used rosewater in dozens of cakes,
cookies and puddings.</TE>
<TE>   In the meanwhile, vanilla had already started to show up. "The
Virginia Housewife" (1824) gave a recipe for vanilla ice cream, and
in the following two decades Leslie and Rutledge used vanilla in a
few ice cream and custard recipes. Vanilla was also essential for
charlotte russe, a highly fashionable mid-19th century dish
consisting mostly of gelatin-stiffened whipped cream.</TE>
<TE>   Rosewater goes fine with almonds--not just in European dishes of
centuries ago but in Middle Eastern pastries today. In the 19th
century, though, European and American desserts had been turning away
from almonds in favor of cream and chocolate, with which vanilla has
a special affinity. So the real question is why vanilla took so long
to make its move. The reason is simply that there had just never been
much vanilla to go around.</TE>
<TE>   As late as the 1830s, every vanilla bean in the world had been
gathered wild in Mexico. But then people started raising vanilla on
islands in the Indian Ocean, and it was there that a freed slave
named Albius invented the process of artificial pollination that made
it possible to produce vanilla on a mass scale. Today 80% of the
world's vanilla still comes from the Indian Ocean islands of
Mauritius, Reunion and Madagascar.</TE>
<TE>   It was after the Civil War that vanilla really made its move. One
sign is that cookbook writers started calling for undefined
"flavoring," which could mean either rosewater or vanilla (or wine,
lemon juice or peach-leaf extract, for that matter).</TE>
<TE>   By the time of "The White House Cookbook" (1887), the triumph of
vanilla was at hand. Chef Hugo Ziemann called for vanilla in 32 of
his recipes, a choice of flavoring in 23 and rosewater in just eight.
Vanilla had become such a staple that it was mostly being sold in the
more convenient form of vanilla extract, and recipes now measured
vanilla by the teaspoon rather than explaining how to use vanilla
beans.</TE>
<TE>   By the 1890s rosewater was a goner. Fanny Farmer's "Boston Cooking
School Cook Book" (1896) mentioned its existence, but not one of her
recipes called for it. The rosewater era had ended in this country,
though perhaps the fragrance lingers on.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Kiss Cakes</TE>
<TE>   Active Work Time: 40 minutes * Total Preparation Time: 1 hour</TE>
<TE>   The yolks left over from this romantic recipe were used up by
making "love cakes"--add 2 ounces of bitter almonds and enough sugar
to make a batter thick enough to be baked in paper boxes. Adapted
from "The Carolina Housewife" by Sarah Rutledge (1847).</TE>
<TE>   6 egg whites</TE>
<TE>   1 1/4 cups sugar</TE>
<TE>   1 tablespoon rosewater</TE>
<TE>   About 1/2 cup fruit jam</TE>
<TE>   Heat the oven to 225 degrees. Line a baking sheet with parchment
paper.</TE>
<TE>   Beat the egg whites to a stiff froth, 2 minutes,then very slowly
add the sugar and rosewater, beating hard until soft peaks form with
a glossy sheen, 3 to 5 minutes. Fill a piping bag fitted with a large
star tip with the sugar mixture and carefully pipe 1 1/2-inch circles
on the baking sheet, spacing them 1 inch apart.</TE>
<TE>   Bake until lightly browned, 35 minutes, then turn the oven off and
let the cakes sit for 45 minutes. Remove the baking sheet from the
oven and carefully remove the cakes from the parchment paper.</TE>
<TE>   Spread the flat side of one cake with about 1/2 teaspoon of the
jam, then press the flat side of another cake against it, making a
ball-shaped morsel. Repeat with the remaining cakes and jam.</TE>
<TE>   About 46 Kiss Cakes. Each cake: 33 calories; 10 mg sodium; 0

<TE>   Plain Pound Cake</TE>
<TE>   Active Work Time: 15 minutes * Total Preparation Time: 1 hour, 45
minutes</TE>
<TE>   "This is the old-fashioned recipe that our mothers used to make,"
says "The White House Cook Book" (1887), from which this is adapted.
It's quite a charming cake, with just a whisper of rose perfume.</TE>
<TE>   2 cups (4 sticks) butter</TE>
<TE>   2 1/2 cups sugar</TE>
<TE>   12 eggs, divided</TE>
<TE>   1 1/2 teaspoons grated nutmeg</TE>
<TE>   1/2 cup white wine</TE>
<TE>   1/2 cup rosewater</TE>
<TE>   4 3/4 cups flour</TE>
<TE>   Heat the oven to 350 degrees. Grease 2 (9x5-inch) loaf pans and
set aside.</TE>
<TE>   Cream the butter and sugar in a large mixing bowl.</TE>
<TE>   Beat the egg yolks then beat into the butter and sugar with the
nutmeg, wine and rosewater. Stir in the flour.</TE>
<TE>   Beat the egg whites until moderately stiff, 3 to 5 minutes, and
fold into the mixture. Divide the batter between the loaf pans and
smooth the tops.</TE>
<TE>   Bake the loaves until light brown and a toothpick inserted in the
middle comes out clean, 1 1/2 hours. Cool the loaves in the pan
slightly, then turn out onto wire racks.</TE>

<TE>   Coconut Custard Pie</TE>
<TE>   Active Work Time: 15 minutes * Total Preparation Time: 1 hour, 25
minutes</TE>
<TE>   Rosewater goes very well with coconut. Adapted from a recipe in
Annabelle P. Hill's "Southern Practical Cookery and Receipt Book"
(1872), using a custard recipe from "The New Doubleday Cookbook"
(1985). Do not use a deep dish pan.</TE>
<TE>   1 sheet frozen puff pastry, thawed</TE>
<TE>   4 eggs</TE>
<TE>   2/3 cup sugar</TE>
<TE>   1/2 teaspoon salt</TE>
<TE>   2 1/2 cups milk</TE>
<TE>   1 teaspoon vanilla extract</TE>
<TE>   1/2 cup shredded unsweetened coconut</TE>
<TE>   2 tablespoons rosewater</TE>
<TE>   Heat the oven to 425 degrees.</TE>
<TE>   Roll out the pastry in a 10-inch circle and place in a 9-inch pie
pan. Trim the edges and crimp. Bake the pastry until it is puffed up
and lightly browned, 15 minutes. Remove it from the oven, flatten it
with your hands and let rest 5 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, beat the eggs lightly in a mixing bowl, add the sugar
and salt, and beat until well mixed. Gradually beat in the milk and
vanilla, then strain through a fine sieve. Stir in the coconut and
rosewater. Place the pie pan on a baking sheet and pour the filling
into the pastry shell.</TE>
<TE>   Bake the pie 15 minutes. Reduce the temperature to 350 degrees and
bake until the pie is browned on top and a toothpick inserted in the
center comes out clean, 40 minutes. Let the pie rest on a wire rack
and serve warm; store leftovers in the refrigerator.</TE>

<LD>DEAR SOS: Some years ago when visiting friends in Austin, Texas, I
was taken to a restaurant called Trudy's North Star. I had a
wonderful dish called Stuffed Avocado, an avocado half filled with
shredded chicken, battered and deep-fried. It was wonderful.</LD>
<LD>   PATRICIA LAMMERTS</LD>
<LD>   Via e-mail</LD>
<TE>   DEAR PATRICIA: In the state of Texas, they'll deep-fry anything
that's not nailed down. But first they dip it and roll it.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Trudy's Stuffed Avocado Special</TE>
<TE>   Active Work Time: 15 minutes * Total Preparation Time: 30 minutes</TE>
<TE>   Serve this with rice and beans.</TE>
<TE>   1 avocado</TE>
<TE>   About 1/4 cup shredded, cooked chicken</TE>
<TE>   1/2 cup buttermilk</TE>
<TE>   1/4 cup flour</TE>
<TE>   1/2 cup saltine cracker crumbs</TE>
<TE>   Oil, for frying</TE>
<TE>   1/2 cup green chile sauce</TE>
<TE>   1/2 cup shredded Cheddar cheese</TE>
<TE>   1/2 cup shredded Jack cheese</TE>
<TE>   Heat the oven to 350 degrees.</TE>
<TE>   Slice the avocado down the middle and remove the pit and skin.
Fill the hollow left by the pit with the chicken. Put the 2 halves of
the avocado back together.</TE>
<TE>   Place the buttermilk in a shallow dish, the flour in another
shallow dish and the cracker crumbs in a third dish. Carefully
holding the avocado together (it's slippery), dip it first in the
buttermilk then roll it in the flour to coat completely. Dip it again
in the buttermilk and roll it in the cracker crumbs until completely
covered.</TE>
<TE>   Heat about 4 cups of oil in a deep saucepan over medium-high heat.
Deep-fry the avocado until golden brown, about 2 minutes. Remove the
avocado with a slotted spoon and drain on paper towels.</TE>
<TE>   Place the avocado in a shallow casserole and press firmly to
flatten just a little. Cover the avocado with the green chile sauce
and Cheddar and Jack cheeses and place in the oven until the cheese
melts, about 10 minutes.</TE>

<HD>Love It or Loathe It, But Don't Say Chardonnay's Boring</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>CHARLES E. OLKEN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The "Anything but Chardonnay" crowd says America's favorite white
grape variety is too oaky. They say it's too high in alcohol. They
say all Chardonnays taste alike. They say--and this really seems to
be the crux of the argument--that there are too many Chardonnays, and
they are bored with the grape.</LD>
<LD>   Well, far be it from me to tell anyone what to drink, but I like
Chardonnay, and I am not in the least bored with it.</LD>
<LD>   That said, I agree that many Chardonnays are simply too oaky,
tasting more like toasted wood and roasted vanilla beans than fruit.
But I also find lots of Chardonnays that have plenty of fruit,
balance and suppleness, where oak is used as a seasoning rather than
as a crutch. And I do agree that many Chardonnays are so high in
alcohol that they're unpleasantly "hot." But I also find plenty of
very ripe Chardonnays that have enough fruit and flavor that high
alcohol is not noticeable.</LD>
<TE>   The Chardonnays discussed here cover a broad range of styles,
illustrating why Chardonnay is loved and loathed by wine tasters.
Many of them are wonderful, but my purpose in this review is not just
to recommend wines, but to show how different Chardonnays can be. Not
all these wines may be to everyone's taste, but none of them is
boring.</TE>
<TE>   *1999 Baileyana Vineyards "Firepeak Vineyard," Edna Valley, $27.
This wine is a good place to start. Its first aroma delivers the
creme brulee-like toasted creaminess of French oak barrels, but it is
balanced by solid fruit. Balance is also the hallmark of the wine's
flavor, with ample acidity giving vitality to the fruit and a sense
of reserve and tightness to the finish. This type of Chardonnay is
neither over-oaked nor overripe, and for that reason it is refreshing
to drink now and will age for several years. With a bit more fruit,
this wine would have earned two stars.</TE>
<TE>   2000 Benziger Family Winery, Carneros, $14. Oak is the major
player in this wine too--not because it has spent more time in fancy
barrels than other wines but because it's basically short on fruit.
The "Anything but Chardonnay" crowd would find fault with it for
this, but the fact is, wines like this are made all over the world.
Sometimes the problem isn't that a winery has resorted to oak to
create personality; the needed fruitiness has simply failed to show
up.</TE>
<TE>   * 2000 Flora Springs "Barrel-Fermented Reserve," Napa Valley, $23.
This is a different style of Chardonnay. It was aged in oak barrels
along with the yeasts left over from the fermentation (the "lees").
This technique is called "sur lies" aging in French. It imparts a
roasted grain character to the wine, which often fits nicely with the
toasty notes from the barrel. This wine is decidedly
"lees-influenced" in its roasted nut/roasted grain notes, but it also
features tight, age-demanding fruit and an attractive mineral
component.</TE>
<TE>   * 2000 Geyser Peak Winery "Ricci Vineyard, Block Collection,"
Carneros, $19. This wine, as well as the "Reserve" from the same
winery that follows, provides a clear look at how oak can come to
dominate when a wine's fruit is not as forward as it needs to be.
This is the better of the two because, even though the wood's
caramelized sweetness is a bit obvious, the appley fruit is juicy
enough to balance it.</TE>
<TE>   2000 Geyser Peak Winery "Reserve," Alexander Valley, $21. In this
wine, the toasty, charred-wood oakiness is excessive; it keeps the
fruit in the background.</TE>
<TE>   ** 1999 Paul Hobbs Winery "Walker Station Vineyard," Russian River
Valley, $60. Winemaker Paul Hobbs is doing great things, and I like
this wine even though it exemplifies almost everything the "ABC"
group finds wrong with Chardonnay. It has immense oak and high
ripeness, but they are buffered by plenty of juicy, appley fruit
tinged with notes of stone and spice. There is a lot of heat in the
finish when you taste it by itself, but with food it seems perfectly
balanced.</TE>
<TE>   * 1999 Paul Hobbs Winery "Cuvee Augustina, Richard Dinner
Vineyard," Sonoma Mountain, $75. This wine is simply an all-out
display of unabashed ripeness and extreme oakiness. It is full, fat
and mouth-coating in texture, and its evident heat warns that it
should be served only with strongly flavored foods. The ABC crowd
would rather drink water than taste this wine. I think they are
missing a good thing, albeit a bit too much of a good thing.</TE>
<TE>   $** 1999 Kunde Winery "Kinneybrook Vineyard," Sonoma Valley, $20.
This wine has the richness and depth of fruit to match the bracing
acidity that sometimes bedevils Chardonnays of this vintage. As a
result, the lavish oak, vanilla, roasted grain and sweet butter notes
in the nose serve to spice the ripe fruit rather than dominate it. In
the mouth, the wine's obvious ripeness is equally well buffered by
fruit and oak, and its lively acidity and firm structure would seem
to ensure that it will grow even better with a few years of bottle
aging.</TE>
<TE>   2000 Sanford Winery, Santa Barbara County, $18. Firm acidity and
hard-charging oak are two main points of this ripe and relatively
spicy wine, but lacking anything more at its heart than a bit of
tentative fruit, it comes up somewhat stiff and short. The result is
that oak again is more evident than it ought to be.</TE>
<TE>   $** 2000 Talley Vineyards "Oliver's Vineyard," Edna Valley, $18.
Not only is this wine an extraordinary value, it illustrates
perfectly why the "ABC" crowd is wrong in its blanket condemnation of
California Chardonnay. Here the elements of ripe apples, toasty oak
and suggestions of lees are harmoniously integrated in soaring,
expansive aromas and are mirrored in the wine's relatively deep,
beautifully defined flavors. The wine is medium full-bodied and
keenly balanced, with good acidity underlying its ripe, ever so
slightly hot finish. But in the end, it is the fruit that lasts
longest on the palate.</TE>

<LD>Loaded with chocolate, the Parisian is the perfect dessert for
Valentine's Day. This beautiful cake has been around since Viktor
Benes opened his bakery on West 3rd Street in Los Angeles in 1966.
The dark chocolate cake is filled and frosted with chocolate whipped
cream, dusted with chocolate around the sides and topped with a thick
layer of shaved chocolate. The Parisian is so popular it is always on
hand in several sizes. The bakery will personalize it by adding a
message written on a chocolate bar.</LD>

<HD>Hey, Want to Grow Your Own Truffles?</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JILL HUNTING</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>This year, skip the master gardening class about how to keep
whiteflies out of your orange trees. Forget the annual pilgrimage to
the nursery for zucchini starts. Plant your own truffle trees and
grow something your friends will actually want.</LD>
<LD>   That's what I've done, with the help of a truffle grower, Mother
Nature and all the patience I can muster.</LD>
<LD>   The most prized truffle varieties are the white truffle of Alba,
Italy (Tuber magnatum pico), and the Perigord black truffle (Tuber
melanosporum). Some say the white truffle will grow nowhere but
Italy; others, such as truffle expert James Trappe, claim there are
suitable growing conditions in other areas--including, perhaps, the
Willamette Valley of Oregon.</LD>
<TE>   As for American-grown black truffles, they are already a
commercial crop. Franklin Garland, proprietor of a mushroom and
truffle company in North Carolina (and now worldwide at www.
garlandtruffles.com), has been selling fresh domestic black truffles
since the late '90s. Garland's Gourmet Mushrooms &amp; Truffles also
sells hazelnut tree seedlings whose roots have been treated with the
famous fungus.</TE>
<TE>   For $1,400, you can buy 100 seedlings, and, in six to 10 years,
with proper conditions and care, you could have truffles at a rate of
a quarter pound per tree. You could eat them, or you could sell them
to Garland--he pays $200 per pound or more, depending on market
conditions--or to the buyer of your choice. Last winter, the
preeminent truffle company, Urbani Truffles &amp; Caviar (www.urbani.com;
(800) 281-2330), was retailing fresh black truffles for $800 to
$1,400 per pound.</TE>
<TE>   Before reaching for your calculator and concluding that you've
come up with a way to finance your children's college education,
consider that truffles are temperamental. Charles Lefevre, a doctoral
candidate in mycology at Oregon State University and another seller
of truffle seedlings (his Web site, www.truffletrees.com is still
under construction), says that parts of California are perfect for
truffles, but success rates can be as low as 50%, even when the host
roots have been inoculated successfully.</TE>
<TE>   He raises other cautions. Truffles like soil that is alkaline and
chalky, which may require adding lime to your backyard. Hearing this,
and having just ordered my truffle seedlings, I looked upon my navel
orange tree and feared for its life. Lime. Isn't that the killer
stuff we sprinkled  behind the tents at Girl Scout camp?</TE>
<TE>   A simple way to test the alkalinity, or pH, of your soil is to mix
a few spoonfuls of dirt with an equal amount of ordinary white
vinegar in a jar with a lid. Shake the mixture and remove the lid. If
you hear a soft fizzing, your soil is moderately alkaline. The more
it fizzes, the higher the pH. A pH of 7 is neutral; truffles like 8
or higher. If your shortcut pH test doesn't discourage you, ask your
local County Extension office if they will perform a soil test. If
you still want to proceed, order your seedlings and plant them as
directed.</TE>
<TE>   "Your orange tree may be able to handle it," Lefevre told me.
"Oranges are often grown in fairly arid climates that tend to have
alkaline soil. Give the truffle trees as much space as possible from
other trees, and gradually expand the limed area so that it takes a
few years to get to the orange's roots."</TE>
<TE>   Black truffles occur naturally between latitudes of 40 and 47
degrees north, between 300 and 3,000 feet above sea level, but given
the right conditions, they will grow farther south. Though the Los
Angeles Basin may be too far south for the elegant tuber, Lefevre
says higher elevations in central California may be suitable.
Northern California has already proven hospitable to truffles.</TE>
<TE>   Californians have been interested in truffle cultivation for
decades, but Lefevre is seeing new signs of truffle fever. Two months
ago he was writing his dissertation when one prospector got his name,
drove 800 miles to find him and appeared with a list of questions.</TE>
<TE>   When Oregon wasabi grower Roy Carver was scouting land for a large
truffle orchard, the Napa Valley was on his list. In the end, he
chose a site in the Texas hill country, which one of his new
neighbors described as "some of the sorriest country in the United
States." Both locations are well south of the truffle's natural home.</TE>
<TE>   Once you've selected a site, amended the soil and planted your
tree seedlings, the next steps are to prune and weed as they grow.
Then comes the hard part: waiting. In time, telltale truffle "marks,"
or bulges, may appear around the tree in late summer, indicating you
may have mature truffles in four to five months.</TE>
<TE>   While you're waiting, you'll have to discourage other vegetation
in the vicinity, with the exception of other hazelnuts. Acid-loving
plants such as camellias and crape myrtles will suffer if they grow
too close.</TE>
<TE>   Eventually, if you've planted correctly, tended properly and been
blessed with the right combination of sunshine, rain and moderate
temperatures, you'll find yourself popular in December and January.
You'll have the secret ingredient for a turkey stuffing your guests
will swoon over, and your homemade truffle-infused oils and sauces
will be on everyone's Christmas list.</TE>
<TE>   If you've done your best but get no truffles, you can always eat
the hazelnuts. Better yet, find a good recipe for hazelnut-filled
chocolate truffles.</TE>

<DH>Restaurants crack down on Valentine's no-shows.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LESLEE KOMAIKO</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Those who figure on playing the field this Valentine's Day by making
multiple dinner reservations and then deciding at the last minute
where to go may have a surprise in store. Or perhaps they've already
discovered that many Los Angeles restaurants--especially swanky,
romantic spots--are asking for a commitment: specifically, a credit
card number.</LD>
<LD>   Other restaurants, meanwhile, are going even further by charging
guests the full dinner amount in advance.</LD>
<LD>   Asia De Cuba for instance, the trendy dining room at the Mondrian
Hotel in West Hollywood, is charging guests $75 per person, the cost
of the five-course, prix-fixe dinner it's offering, plus 15% service,
at the time of the booking. The charge is refundable, however, if the
reservation is canceled by Friday.</LD>
<TE>   "It's to avoid getting burned," says Mitch Mehr, the restaurant's
food and beverage manager. "It's to say, if you're serious and you
want to eat here, let us know and you'll have the time of your life."
But since the restaurant is doing a set menu with dishes not normally
offered, "We want to know in advance exactly how much to purchase and
how to staff," he says.</TE>
<TE>   In other words, the restaurant doesn't want to be stuck with
gallons of extra cactus pear, lime and tequila sorbet.</TE>
<TE>   For the last couple of years, Calabasas' rustic Saddle Peak Lodge,
a popular Valentine's destination offering a $95-per-person,
five-course prix-fixe dinner, has faxed would-be diners a simple
form. Until it is faxed back, the reservation is not confirmed. In
addition to asking for credit card information and a signature, the
form spells out the restaurant's policy: No-shows will be charged $35
per person.</TE>
<TE>   So far the policy seems to have worked. "In the last two years,
we've had to charge maybe four or five reservations, that is it,"
says managing partner Gerhard Tratter. "If people are willing to go
with this system and write down the information, they are serious
about coming to you." Tratter says previous no-show rates for
holidays had been as high as 30% to 40%.</TE>
<TE>   The policy is absolutely essential, Tratter says, "especially if
you're tight on tables or really sought after. Otherwise you end up
with a lot of empty seats."</TE>
<TE>   Josie, an intimate Santa Monica restaurant known for its eclectic
menu, has an even tougher policy. There will be a $25-per-person
charge for Valentine's reservations canceled after noon on Friday.
And no-shows will be charged $50 a head.</TE>
<TE>   "I would rather not do this, of course," says chef/owner Josie Le
Balch, echoing many restaurateurs who don't relish the extra
paperwork. But with only 75 seats in the restaurant, to lose even
three tables would be disastrous. "I want to stay in business," she
says. "I want a commitment for that night. And for the most part, my
customers like to know they have a guarantee. So it works both ways."</TE>
<TE>   Both Saddle Peak Lodge and Josie were taking credit card
information for Valentine's Day even before the evening's menus were
conceived. This became a hot topic on the Los Angeles message board
of the Chowhound.com Web site. Some called Josie "arrogant" and
"highhanded." Others defended the practice, alluding to Angelenos'
infamous flakiness.</TE>
<TE>   "I agree with the guy who said, 'I'd like to see a menu before I
commit to something,'" says Le Balch. "But I've had a following for
quite a long time. People like my food. It's not like I'm trying to
be snobby." Besides, she adds, like many chefs, she regularly changes
details of her menu according to what's in the day's market
(beautiful carrots, tired spinach).</TE>
<TE>   There does seem to be at least a loose relationship between a
restaurant's location and whether or not it is requiring credit
cards. For instance, Gustav Anders, the acclaimed Scandinavian dining
room in Costa Mesa, is taking just names and phone numbers.</TE>
<TE>   "You gotta remember where we are," says waitress Dana Heuberger.
"Orange County is very conservative compared to L.A. If people call
to make a reservation, that means they're actually going to come and
dine.</TE>
<TE>   "People in bigger cities get kind of cocky or flighty and say,
'We'll go here and we'll make a reservation.' And maybe they'll show
and maybe they won't. And I think they're a younger crowd. They're
more go with the flow. Up in L.A. it's more hip. Our clientele is a
little older and more conscientious."</TE>
<TE>   Tratter agrees. "I would definitely say it's a big-city thing. It
has to do with the very busy lives of individuals that are making
reservations. Often those people don't even make their own
reservations. They have other people do it."</TE>
<TE>   Not every upscale Los Angeles restaurant is going the advance
credit card route this Valentine's Day.</TE>
<TE>   John Rucci, food and beverage director at the Peninsula Hotel in
Beverly Hills, home to the sophisticated California-French restaurant
Belvedere, says it's too much paperwork. "It's the equivalent of a
bureaucracy just to go out to dinner."</TE>
<TE>   Besides, he said, making diners feel like you're "giving them the
honor of spending money in your establishment seems a bit obtrusive,
to put it politely."</TE>

<LD>After lunch one day, Joel Robuchon joined a group of newspaper
editors for a drink. One would think a chef so brilliant would know
better. The result was a series of columns in the weekly Journal du
Dimanche, which have now been collected as "La Cuisine de Joel
Robuchon" (CassellPaperbacks, $24.95). Though the book may be
somewhat difficult to find, it is worth the search (look online or at
Cook's Library on West 3rd Street near the Beverly Center).</LD>
<LD>   Robuchon, of course, is one of the most highly praised chefs in
French culinary history. His Paris restaurant, Robuchon, was a
longtime Michelin three-star winner and was acknowledged to be one of
the best in the world. He closed it in 1996 (Alain Ducasse took over
the site for one of his three-star restaurants) and is now loosely
engaged in writing, television and consulting. There are recurring
rumors that he is working on reopening in Paris, but nothing has yet
emerged.</LD>
<LD>   In 1991, Robuchon teamed with Patricia Wells to write "Simply
French" (Hearst Books, $30), still one of the best chef books for
home cooks. The two also teamed for "L'Atelier of Joel Robuchon"
(John Wiley, $50), which followed the evolution of some of Robuchon's
seminal ideas through the works of other chefs who had shared his
kitchen. It was intellectually interesting, though not nearly so
user-friendly.</LD>
<TE>   In "La Cuisine," Robuchon proceeds through the year at a stately
pace, tackling one ingredient a week. Some are seasonal, others not.
Some are costly and rare, others are in every supermarket. Topics
range from bacon and potatoes to wild mushrooms and lobster. On a few
occasions, a dish is highlighted, rather than a foodstuff--pot au feu
or tarts.</TE>
<TE>   What joins all these pieces together is simply that the chef
deemed them interesting enough for a column (or in a few cases, one
can't help suspecting, that he had a really good recipe).</TE>
<TE>   But what really makes the book is not the topics covered or even
the recipes themselves, but rather Robuchon's piercing culinary
intelligence. "La Cuisine" is at its best when the chef is talking
about the nuts and bolts of how cooking works--the distilled insights
of decades of experience.</TE>
<TE>   With foie gras, for example, Robuchon distinguishes between duck
and goose liver: "For cold liver terrine, I favor goose liver, on
account of its greater subtlety of flavor. Duck liver, which is more
bitter and has a coarser fragrance is more difficult to work with but
is superior to goose liver should you decide to serve it warm."</TE>
<TE>   Or his advice on salting French fries: "I always mix coarse and
fine salt, for a seasoning that crackles a little between the teeth."</TE>
<TE>   At times, he can be downright shocking (well, in a cuisine-y kind
of way): "Some chefs spice lamb with garlic, but I am not in favor of
this practice; I prefer to season it with chopped parsley....Take
care never to pierce the meat, either when it is raw or in the course
of cooking." So much for the classic leg stuffed with garlic slivers!</TE>
<TE>   The dishes are, on the whole, very home-cook-friendly. No five
sub-recipe recipes here. The techniques are straightforward, without
being condescending, and there are enough surprises that you never
feel like you're getting the same old thing. Robuchon roasts lamb
loin in a salt crust, and whisks olive oil into a reduced fish stock
to make a silky emulsion.</TE>
<TE>   Given all of that, it may seem nitpicking to point out that the
book could have been better edited. Part of the problem is the
recipes, which are only roughly translated. More basic is the
structure of the column, which follows a very stale, very French,
format, so you've got to read through a lot of dross to get to the
gold.</TE>
<TE>   First comes an anodyne introductory paragraph: "Since the dawn of
humanity, pork has constituted an abundant source of nourishment for
mankind." Then follows a series of unrelated--in most cases well
hashed-over--bits of kitchen history (e.g., the word "salary" is
rooted in salt).</TE>
<TE>   For the most part, this kind of stuff went out of fashion in this
country with Waverly Root. On the other hand, given what follows,
that's a small enough price to pay.</TE>

<HD>Wine of the Week</HD>
<DH>1999 Chateau de Beaucastel Chateauneuf-du-Pape, Southern
Rhone.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>S. Irene Virbila</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Anyone who has ever fallen for the wild, scrubby landscape around the
Provencal town of Orange and its Roman amphitheater would surely feel
the same about the village of Chateauneuf-du-Pape, where gnarled
vines grow in vineyards covered with white stones the size of ostrich
eggs. Unlike the northern Rhone, where the best reds are primarily
Syrah, Chateauneuf takes pride in blending as many as 13 traditional
grape varietals for the heady wines it wrests from this hardscrabble
setting.</LD>
<LD>   The Perrin brothers of Chateau de Beaucastel have an impressive
track record of making lush, long-lived Chateauneufs that find their
way onto top restaurant wine lists. This one is gorgeous. Intense and
deeply colored; it seduces you from the first sip with its deep,
plummy fruit, its taste of earth and spice. This is a southern Rhone
without any of the region's rustic qualities, one that really is
worthy of a pope's table.</LD>

<HD>The Highway Robbery of Your Life</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN BALZAR</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Yesterday, I took a drive. It was a reminder of the single worst
thing about life in our cities. I headed toward Los Angeles up the
Long Beach Freeway--a spigot of globalism where goods from Asia flow
into the U.S. in a nonstop river of trucks.</LD>
<LD>   Well, not exactly nonstop. I spent plenty of my one-hour trip
stopped cold in the rattling shadow of 40-ton container rigs.</LD>
<LD>   As bad as it was, though, things could have been worse.</LD>
<TE>   When this freeway opens up, as sometimes happens, the roadbed is
so severely cracked, patched, corrugated and lopsided that cars and
trucks alike shimmy terrifyingly at 60 mph like wild logs through a
flume. This is a two-handed, hang-on-to-your-coffee kind of road. As
a consequence, it's also a graveyard.</TE>
<TE>   A few random facts: Here in Southern California, we spend about
101/2 days of our lives each year--or one entire year over the course
of a working lifetime--at a dead stop in freeway traffic, and much of
the urbanized parts of the country are catching up. We burn about
$1,000 in needless gas, each of us.</TE>
<TE>   And when we're lucky and traffic moves, we kill each other in mass
bloodshed that makes war pale: about 15 times as many dead last year
as were slain by terrorists.</TE>
<TE>   Now look ahead: Average freeway speeds will drop by one-third to
18 mph in the next couple of decades as the population grows and our
roads don't. And poor repair will leave highways even more dangerous.</TE>
<TE>   One more fact: President Bush proposes cutting highway funds by
27%.</TE>
<TE>   I sputter and grope for words.</TE>
<TE>   Honestly, what can you say about reasoning like this? A friend
called the president's budget "a sentence." As in five-to-10 with no
chance of parole.</TE>
<TE>   Highway projects already take far too long. The president's
proposal will accelerate the nation's retreat from livability,
worsening our daily lives in tangible, everyday ways.</TE>
<TE>   Maintenance backlogs on highways already cost the nation $5.8
billion a year, according to the American Society of Civil Engineers.
One-third of the country's roadways are in poor condition. Nearly
two-thirds of the miles driven in this country are in congested
traffic.</TE>
<TE>   Right now, Washington is throwing money at homeland defense with
the abandon of teenagers trying to impress their prom dates. Never
mind that there is something else basic to our well-being and safety.</TE>
<TE>   Does it make a lick of sense, for instance, to pour $5.9 billion
into bioterrorism preparations and cut highway spending $8.6 billion?</TE>
<TE>   In a word, no.</TE>
<TE>   Bioterrorism killed five people in the U.S. in 2001. Unsafe
highways were responsible for 13,800 needless fatalities--or
one-third of the total slaughter on our roads.</TE>
<TE>   Priorities ought to take account of things like that, don't you
think?</TE>
<TE>   Or how about economics? According to TRIP, a nonprofit
organization that studies highway issues, the loss of efficiency in
the American economy was $78 billion in 1999 on account of congestion
and accidents.</TE>
<TE>   I shudder to think about 2025. I've never felt further from
Washington than right now with this screwball budgetary logic that is
actually worse than it appears. The chain reaction of misery will
only snowball as federal cuts land on state transportation
departments already threatened by a flood tide of red ink. What could
these people be thinking?</TE>
<TE>   In the last quarter of a century, much of urban life has improved.
The air is cleaner in big cities, the water generally purer. The
sprawl in Western cities has begun to coalesce into vibrant urban
villages. Crime haunts us but not as badly as it once did.</TE>
<TE>   But in the everyday struggle to get around, our lives have been
immeasurably diminished. Our buses are abominable and rail systems in
most cities are spotty to nonexistent. Our roads are choked,
crumbling and deadly.</TE>
<TE>   Argue for tax cuts for the wealthy if you must. Agree with the
president that people do a better job of spending their money than
the government does. But then tell me, how are you going to get to
work? How long is it going to take you to get to Grandma's?</TE>
<TE>   Isn't there something else you might want to do with those two
weeks that you'll be sitting on the freeway parking lot this year?</TE>

<HD>Hollywood Whitewash of the Cold War's Shameful Red Stain</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROY M. BREWER</AU>
<BD>Roy M. Brewer was the international representative of
the International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees from 1945 to
1953.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When I learned that the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences
was planning an exhibition chronicling the so-called Red Scare in
Hollywood during the 1940s and '50s, I hoped it would be the
beginning of the industry finally acknowledging what really happened
during that era. But having attended the unveiling of "Reds and
Blacklists: Political Struggles in the Movie Industry," I realize
that was wishful thinking.</LD>
<LD>   Since the end of the Cold War, documentary evidence has emerged
showing the depth to which Josef Stalin's agents sought to immerse
themselves in American society. Top-secret cables between Moscow and
the U.S. prove the broad scope of the Communist network, and even the
most skeptical of historians admit that the weight of declassified
evidence against Alger Hiss and Harry Dexter White, government
officials accused of Soviet espionage, is overwhelming. Usually,
Hollywood prides itself on launching trends. But in coming to grips
with the hard truths of the Cold War, this town has consistently been
behind the curve.</LD>
<TE>   More than 50 years ago, Screen Actors Guild President Ronald
Reagan and I were on the front lines in the war against communism
with a who's who of Hollywood beside us. Mostly, we were staunch
liberals and passionate champions of labor who became outraged at the
way political activists masquerading as artists were trying to use
the picture business for their narrow ideology. During the struggle,
I became aware of the power and dimension of the Communist apparatus.
I realized that the party wasn't a ragtag group of wild radicals but
was operated by talented, highly trained individuals with amazing
power to seduce and manipulate good people.</TE>
<TE>   Hollywood is a town built on emotion, and the Communist Party
preyed on that. I saw firsthand how it operated in secret, like a
cult, seeking out artists and laborers. A recruit who refused to take
orders from the stalwarts soon would find himself in dire straits.
Often, he was dealt with by having his affiliation leaked to the
press, resulting in ostracism by the party and denunciation by
anti-communists. Reagan and I spent countless hours helping to
rehabilitate those who wanted to make a clean break from the party
and get their lives back.</TE>
<TE>   Curiously, the academy exhibit doesn't tell this side of the
story. There is no acknowledgment that Soviet communism was indeed a
threat to the security of the free world or that the party was
indefatigable in its goal of influencing our culture.</TE>
<TE>   And the academy apparently still doesn't want to set the record
straight about what has become known as the "blacklist." Contrary to
popular myth, no such single document of names ever existed. Rather,
the industry employment policy banning Communist Party members was
announced at a highly publicized press conference in 1947. Studio
executives were businessmen, and they knew that communism was bad for
box office.</TE>
<TE>   The academy's exhibit also fails to give credence to the other
reason for refusing to hire those who got caught up in the web of
communism: Their politics were repugnant. In his recent memoir,
historian Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr. compares working alongside a
committed Communist with being associated with a Nazi fellow
traveler. "Stalin probably killed more innocent people than Hitler
did, but the defenders of Stalin, unlike the defenders of Hitler,
were somehow deemed within the circle of civilized people,"
Schlesinger writes.</TE>
<TE>   Much of what happened during that period could have been avoided
if artists had banded together to break the secrecy of the party. As
director Elia Kazan once said, "I believe we should all of us name
all of us, establish the truth of what went on. This thing would be
off our backs." Some people, however, placed more importance on
politicking than filmmaking.</TE>
<TE>   In its role as historian, the academy failed the industry,
especially those too young to remember this era. Fair-minded people
should be saddened that Hollywood's preeminent institution missed a
golden opportunity to tell the full truth about the events of
half-a-century ago.</TE>

<HD>Hahn Showed Guts in Shunning Chief Parks</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ERWIN CHEMERINSKY</AU>
<BD>Erwin Chemerinsky is a constitutional law professor at
USC.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Mayor James K. Hahn's decision to oppose reappointment of LAPD Chief
Bernard C. Parks is an act of political courage. Hahn never would
have won election as mayor without strong support from the African
American community. Yet despite vocal support for Parks among African
American leaders, Hahn decided that the Police Department would be
better off with a new chief. The mayor is to be applauded for making
this decision on the merits and not based on pleasing a crucial
constituency.</LD>
<LD>   Although undoubtedly painful and potentially divisive, Hahn made
the right choice for Los Angeles. Parks unquestionably has many
strengths as chief. He is a person of impeccable integrity and a
tough disciplinarian who rose through the ranks.</LD>
<LD>   Despite his experience and virtues as chief, a change at the top
is essential. Morale among the rank and file is desperately low. A
year and a half ago, I did a report on the Rampart scandal at the
request of the Police Protective League, and in talking with dozens
of officers, I was startled by the low morale. A study by
PricewaterhouseCoopers, commissioned by the Police Commission, came
to the same conclusion.</LD>
<TE>   Although many factors contribute to the dispirited attitude of so
many officers, the most important is a lack of confidence in Parks.
Officers widely perceive him as an arbitrary disciplinarian, at times
imposing tough sanctions for minor infractions, while at other times
giving a slap on the wrist to command staff who commit serious
violations. Officers believe that Parks frequently undermines the
independent Board of Rights procedure by influencing how panel
members adjudicate disciplinary cases.</TE>
<TE>   Whether these perceptions are accurate is less important than that
they are widespread among officers. The Police Protective League, the
official police union, strongly opposes Parks' reappointment. The
reality is that no chief can succeed, and certainly cannot accomplish
reform, with such intense opposition from those he is supposed to
lead.</TE>
<TE>   Hahn also made the right choice because it is clear that Parks is
not the person to reform the LAPD. The revelations concerning the
Rampart scandal show that reform is imperative. Officers planted
evidence to frame innocent people and lied in court to gain
convictions.</TE>
<TE>   The extent of the Rampart scandal never has been known and now
probably never will be. Parks is responsible for this because he
successfully opposed an independent investigation by a commission
with subpoena power and the authority to grant immunity to officers
from discipline for not having previously reported misconduct.</TE>
<TE>   Parks never has been willing to acknowledge the serious problems
reflected by the Rampart scandal. A chief who does not recognize the
problem cannot be the one to solve it.</TE>
<TE>   Every study of the LAPD has shown an essential need for reform.
Parks, though, has opposed all such efforts, particularly if they
involve any outside oversight. He resisted investigation of Rampart
by the district attorney and went so far as to order his department
not to cooperate. Both the California attorney general and the city
attorney ordered Parks to rescind his order.</TE>
<TE>   Parks opposed the consent decree between the federal Department of
Justice and the city to reform the LAPD, going along only when it was
obvious that there were sufficient votes in the City Council to make
it happen. Parks has consistently obstructed the work of the
inspector general within the LAPD by denying access to information
and refusing to cooperate.</TE>
<TE>   Simply put, Parks embodies the culture of the LAPD and is not the
person to change it.</TE>
<TE>   Now is the time for others in city government to show the same
courage as Hahn. The Police Commission, whose members were appointed
by Hahn, should immediately express its support for the mayor's
decision. Under the City Charter, the Police Commission could
reappoint Parks, notwithstanding the mayor's views. The City Council
then could overturn the commission by a two-thirds vote. The
commission should spare the city such a divisive fight and announce
its agreement with the mayor.</TE>
<TE>   No one should rejoice at the mayor's difficult decision. Parks
served the city well for more than two decades. But Hahn did the
right thing for the right reason: The LAPD needs a new leader.</TE>

<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KHALID KHAWAJA, SHAHEEN SEHBAI and MANSOOR IJAZ</AU>
<BD>Khalid Khawaja, a former official of Pakistan's
Inter-Services Intelligence agency, worked closely with Saudi
fugitive Osama bin Laden to resist the Soviet occupation of
Afghanistan during the 1980s. Shaheen Sehbai, a Pakistani citizen, is
editor of the News International, Pakistan's largest English language
daily. Mansoor Ijaz, an American Muslim of Pakistani origin, is a New
York financier.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As we make this plea for Danny Pearl's unconditional release, he is
believed to be alive. We pray he will be reunited with his pregnant
wife without delay. Pearl's kidnapping has hit each of us in very
personal ways because we are at once his friends and his partners in
trying to bridge the gap of understanding between puritanical Islam
and the West.</LD>
<LD>   Pearl came to know radical Islam's inner sanctum in Pakistan
through us. We are witness that through his dialogue with Muslim
fundamentalists, the world was beginning to learn more about
puritanical Islam's evolutionary track and the people shaping
it--knowledge that would help us all bridge the misconceptions about
a great monotheistic religion.</LD>
<TE>   With each day that passes without word on his condition or
whereabouts, we feel compelled to remind Pearl's captors of the
irretrievable damage they are doing to themselves, their cause and
their religion if he is not immediately released. Kidnappers are
often motivated by money, religion, politics or just plain revenge.
Our joint plea, coming from widely differing perceptions--those of a
Muslim fundamentalist, a secular Pakistani journalist and an American
Muslim businessman--is to remind Pearl's captors that justice is
blind to their motives. To get justice, you must offer it. Releasing
an innocent man who is doing a vital job not only would show the
kidnappers' righteousness, it would pave the road for a better
understanding of the motivations that drive their anger and
frustration.</TE>
<TE>   What better way for the world to understand the agenda and
ideology of puritanical Islam than for its followers to collectively
get involved in the effort to secure Pearl's release. If Harkat ul
Moujahedeen, Jamaat ul Fuqra and its leader, Sheik Mubarak Ali Shah
Gilani, or other puritan Muslim groups are not complicit in the
kidnapping, then they should stand up and be counted in the fight to
obtain his freedom.</TE>
<TE>   The Koran is very clear about the taking of innocent life:</TE>
<TE>   "Whosoever killeth a human being for other than manslaughter or
corruption in the Earth, it shall be as if he had killed all mankind,
and whosoever saveth the life of one, it shall be as if he had saved
the life of all mankind" [Sura Maida, V.32].</TE>
<TE>   Save all of mankind by saving Pearl. Only then can the world know
you are true Muslims and begin to understand your grievances. In
doing so, you will enable others to do the same. It would be just,
for example, to call on U.S. authorities to end an extradition
request for Sheik Gilani if Pearl is released unharmed.</TE>
<TE>   If the motivation is money or an individual's or group's revenge
for the loss of family members in the U.S. war on terrorism, the
captors should seek redress through Qisas, Islam's form of
compensation for forgiving the criminal act, rather than resorting to
mob-style tactics. Pearl's employer already has offered a forum for
expressing political and even personal grievances.</TE>
<TE>   If the motivation behind Pearl's kidnapping is the murky politics
of a government agency or rogue elements within the establishment
seeking redress for decisions of the state to fight against
terrorists, harming Pearl will only deepen the resolve to root them
out and extinguish their politics. The kidnappers may believe that
they have embarrassed Pakistan's government or taken its newfound
relations with the U.S. hostage with their deeds, but instead they've
driven the states closer together in the common objective to defeat
them.</TE>
<TE>   The kidnappers may believe they have toppled another symbol of
U.S. power--the Wall Street Journal--by holding one of its reporters
hostage. But in reality, they have strengthened its resolve--and that
of every other news outlet in the free world--to ensure that a true
picture of their intent and actions is made known.</TE>
<TE>   The kidnappers may believe they have furthered their jihad against
the West and all it represents, but the jihad was over before it
started in the very act of taking hostage an innocent man who was
explaining to the world who they are and what they want.</TE>
<TE>   It's time they let Pearl go back to his family.</TE>

<HD>Bush's Magic Budget</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>With its glossy book format and American flag on the cover, President
Bush's $2.1-trillion budget proposal couldn't be better packaged. But
its looks aren't fooling anyone who can add. A national poll in
Tuesday's Times has a very clear message for Bush: A wide majority of
Americans, including two-thirds of Republicans, say they support
delaying tax cuts rather than tapping Social Security funds to pay
for Bush's extravaganza.</LD>
<LD>   No one questions the need to run a deficit during a recession and
war. But excess spending should be targeted, productive and
temporary. The Bush plan, requesting $590 billion in additional tax
cuts and $550 billion in new military spending over the next decade,
is none of these. Some of the heavy weaponry, such as the Crusader
howitzer, that the administration wants makes no sense for fighting
terrorism. Nor does speeding up tax cuts or piling on personal and
corporate write-offs.</LD>
<LD>   The administration's proposals for cutting spending are
mean-spirited: reducing environmental and job training programs as
well as more cuttable highway funds.</LD>
<TE>   Worst, however, are the gimmicks that conceal the truth. The White
House knows very well that Congress, in an election year and painful
recession, is likely to restore funds for job training and other
programs. A series of Enron-like accounting devices and overly
optimistic revenue assumptions also conceal the extent of the damage.</TE>
<TE>   Consider: The White House wishes away what the congressional Joint
Tax Committee estimates will be several hundred billion dollars in
lost revenue over the decade by wrongly assuming that Congress will
not continue protecting middle-class taxpayers from having to pay the
alternative minimum tax, which was meant to nail tax-sheltering
millionaires. Without action, the middle-class exemption would expire
in 2004.</TE>
<TE>   The administration also uses the trick of phasing in tax cuts
slowly so that the full bill doesn't come due until the end of the
decade, long after Bush is gone. Its estimate of Medicare costs is
$300 billion less than the Congressional Budget Office's. Flying in
the face of economic reality, it predicts that costs for homeland
security, education and veterans' programs will decline after 2003.
Above all, the administration totally ignores the costs of its
permanent tax cuts in the decade from  2012 to 2022--trillions more
will be lost at the very moment the baby boom generation is retiring.</TE>
<TE>   Bush is using the war on terrorism and his still-stratospheric
approval ratings to browbeat Congress, but Senate Majority Leader Tom
Daschle of South Dakota and other leading Democrats have an
obligation. They should not only point out the dangers in Bush's
budget plan but act: Delay tax cuts, closely inspect military
spending and protect Medicare and Social Security. With the support
of three-quarters of Americans, they need not surrender to the
president's reckless economic policies wrapped in anti-terrorism.</TE>

<LD>In 1958, a judge threw out Mississippi's ban on interracial
cohabitation, not because he considered it morally repugnant and
unconstitutional but because lawmakers had inadvertently mangled the
statute's language so badly as to render it nonsensical and
unenforceable. The next year, a law student by the name of Charles
Pickering penned a law review article suggesting language that would
fix the problem. The remedy he urged would let Mississippi
authorities bring felony prosecutions against men and women because
of whom they married or otherwise lived with.</LD>
<LD>   Charles Pickering Sr. now sits on the U.S. District Court in
Mississippi, named to it in 1990 by then-President George Bush. Last
year, President George W. Bush nominated Pickering for a seat on the
powerful 5th Circuit Court of Appeals. Thursday, Pickering is
scheduled to appear before the Senate Judiciary Committee to defend
his record on the bench and, before that, as a state legislator and
the Republican Party state chairman.</LD>
<LD>   We have condemned the years-long partisan stalemate over judicial
nominations. We are just as concerned, however, that the men and
women who become life-tenured federal judges be committed to the
principles of fairness and equality that guide this nation. At his
hearing, Pickering will no doubt put the best light on his actions.
But the Judiciary Committee should send his nomination back to Bush.</LD>
<TE>   Pickering's decisions in voting rights, discrimination and
prisoner rights cases display indifference if not hostility to those
asking the courts to remedy injustice. In several voting rights
cases, he sharply criticized the principle of one person, one vote as
upsetting state and local government operations and as costing a
"tremendous amount of taxpayer money." Pickering has been no more
disposed toward hearing from plaintiffs who claim bias on the job.
His tendency to interject his personal opinions, biblical quotations
and other extralegal materials into judicial opinions demonstrates
that he lacks the open mind and equanimity that Americans require of
their judges.</TE>
<TE>   Because Pickering served in the Mississippi Senate and as a party
chairman, his ideological views are well known, among them his
vigorous opposition to abortion rights and homosexuality. Pickering
has, as well, been evasive if not misleading about his involvement
over a number of years with the Mississippi Sovereignty Commission, a
state-funded agency established to oppose integration efforts.</TE>
<TE>   Nevertheless, Pickering has a powerful friend in Senate Minority
Leader Trent Lott (R-Miss.), and Lott is playing hardball. Lott's
colleagues can expect repercussions for "no" votes. Money for their
pet projects may disappear. Their bills may bog down. But the
American people have the right to expect their judges, especially
those on the powerful appeals court, to listen to each case with an
open mind and judge it on the law and its merits. Pickering can't do
that. The Judiciary Committee should reject his nomination.</TE>

<LD>They've done it again--changed the voting rules for California's
primary election. Here's an update along with some reminders:</LD>
<LD>   * Slackers still have time to register to vote in the March 5
statewide primary. The deadline for registration has changed, from
one month before the election to two weeks. The deadline therefore
will be the close of business Feb. 19. Voters who have cast ballots
in past elections and have not changed addresses usually remain
registered and don't need to do anything. Voter registration cards
can be obtained from many government offices and some supermarkets
and other stores. They can also be downloaded from the Web sites of
the secretary of state (www.ss.ca.gov) or the county registrar
(www.lavote.net).</LD>
<LD>   * When voters go to the polls March 5, they will not be able to
vote for any candidate from any party as they did in the 2000 "open"
primary. The courts ruled that the system violated a political
party's right to limit primaries generally to its own members. Now,
voters registered with a party receive a ballot listing only that
party's candidates, as before 2000. Registered independents, however,
may request the ballot for the Democratic, Republican, American
Independent or Natural Law parties--the parties that opted to let
independents participate.</LD>
<TE>   * And beginning with this election, any voter can sign up to be a
permanent absentee voter. In some counties, all the voter needs to do
is check a box on the absentee ballot application included in the
sample ballot each voter is mailed. In Los Angeles County, the voter
must either call the registrar's office at (562) 466-1323 or write to
the registrar of voters at P.O. Box 30450, Los Angeles 90030-0450.
For one-time absentee ballots, voters can return the absentee form on
the back of the sample ballot or download the form from their county
registrar's Web site.</TE>
<TE>   Counties are seeking additional poll workers, especially those who
speak Cantonese, Japanese, Mandarin, Korean, Spanish, Tagalog or
Vietnamese. The volunteer must be a U.S. citizen, a registered voter
and a resident of the county. One may apply via the county voter Web
site or by calling the registrar's office. The polls will, as usual,
open at 7 a.m. and close at 8 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   More registration and voting information can be obtained from the
secretary of state at (800) 345-VOTE or the Los Angeles County
registrar of voters at (800) 815-2666, which provides  a recorded
menu of options.</TE>

<HD>Discipline Measures Rankle LAPD Officers</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"A New Way of Policing the LAPD," Feb. 3: I am wholeheartedly in
Chief Bernard Parks' corner for implementing a system for the LAPD
that makes officers accountable for their actions. These officers
should be beyond reproach in their duties as officers and pillars of
our community. They should be looked up to as examples of law and
order. From the 1960s to the Rampart Division fiasco, nothing has
changed. It is time for change and accountability.</LD>
<LD>   Ron Bianchi</LD>
<LD>   Castaic</LD>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The LAPD doesn't like being punished for breaking the rules. The
enforcers don't like the enforcement. The solution: Change the boss,
get someone soft.</TE>
<TE>   I thought law enforcement liked those who were tough on crime. The
next time I get a traffic ticket, I'll tell the judge the police
officer was too tough and that if I should be convicted, my morale
would suffer, so please let me slide.</TE>
<TE>   I'll tell the complaining police officers what they would tell any
of us: If you don't like the punishment, don't do the crime.</TE>
<TE>   Norwood Price</TE>
<TE>   Burbank</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Parks fails to inspire officers to do better by creating an esprit
de corps and a sense of mission. He only punishes; he does not
reward. Six thousand disciplinary procedures per year shows how
draconian his methods are. Parks' approach is reminiscent of
something an American military officer said during the war in
Southeast Asia, that "it became necessary to destroy the village in
order to save it."</TE>
<TE>   Neal Berke</TE>
<TE>   Valley Glen</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The facts that the Police Protective League wants Parks out, that
police officers with disciplinary actions pending are complaining to
the ACLU and that complaints against officers are getting real
attention are the most ringing endorsements for the retention of
Parks. Individual officers on the street have an extreme amount of
discretion and little real oversight without an effective complaint
system, which Parks has sought to establish. He deserves another
term.</TE>
<TE>   Mark Boykin</TE>
<TE>   Tarzana</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Parks disqualified himself from any consideration for the position
when he dismissed the Rampart scandal as a failure of management. If
he is unable or unwilling to read his job description, then he should
be dismissed without further discussions.</TE>

<LD>Re "A New Direction for 4 Orphaned Brothers, Sisters," Feb. 2:
Everyone who pitched in to help the Lee children stay together, from
their friends and teachers to the remarkable foster father, Gavin
Glynn, is to be commended. And to all those who oppose gay adoption,
ask yourself this: How many people open their homes and their hearts
to even one stranger, let alone four teenagers with emotional wounds?
Family values means putting your time, effort, heart and money on the
line, and Glynn is the kind of foster parent we need more of. How
fortunate these children are to have found a home with a generous,
responsible, selfless man like him, and how fortunate our society is
that it's legal for him to do so.</LD>

<LD>President Bush's threats to other nations that they should abstain
from developing weapons of mass destruction would carry much more
weight and moral authority if he would concurrently reduce our own
nuclear capabilities rather than withdrawing from treaties designed

<HD>Keep Options Open for Disabled Students</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The inclusion and mainstreaming of disabled students are a part of
federal law that has been conveniently overlooked by California
schools for many years now ("L.A. to Integrate Disabled Pupils," Jan.
31). A disabled child's right to be integrated into the general
education classroom has been (pretty much) confined to a legal right
for disabled children whose parents can afford an attorney.</LD>
<LD>   This should be viewed as a long-overdue civil rights victory on
behalf of the disabled children. Unfortunately, many parents with
mainstreamed or included children have come to realize that
"inclusion by exclusion" is the result of dumping special-needs
students in classrooms and playgrounds without appropriate supports
and facilitation. If the school district is going to finally try to
comply with the law, then it should give those students and teachers
every opportunity to be successful.</LD>

<TE>   The students who attend special education campuses in the LAUSD
have a variety of severe disabilities. They require a supportive
learning environment that assures them a quality education as well as
a community that guarantees them safety and respect. A special
education campus is able to offer students with mental retardation
and various other severe disabilities an educational opportunity as
close to a general education experience as possible. This is
accomplished in an environment that promotes independence, an
individualized education plan and dignity.</TE>
<TE>   On a general education campus my students would be placed in a
more restrictive learning environment. They would lose the freedom
that a special campus offers them. The students I teach are
nonverbal; they are unaware of danger and dangerous situations. On a
general education campus they would require constant teacher
supervision--at all times--on the playground, in the hallways and in
the restroom.</TE>
<TE>   The closing of special education campuses could take away parents'
rights to choose the most appropriate educational setting for their
special-needs children. We need to keep the full continuum of options
open in order to provide an appropriate educational experience for
all students with severe disabilities.</TE>

<HD>HUD Funding Cuts Hurt L.A. Housing Authority</HD>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In "Agency Takes a Bite Out of Housing Police" (Feb. 3), HUD
spokeswoman Nancy Segerdahl was reported as saying the federal
government should not be held responsible for the policing reductions
in housing projects run by the Los Angeles Housing Authority, as the
authority is not told how to spend its money. I would argue that HUD
is responsible, because not enough money has been given to the
authority to tackle the dual issues of housing-project maintenance
and policing.</LD>
<LD>   In spite of funding shortfalls, the Los Angeles Housing Authority
used perhaps its most important resource--people--to create workshops
wherein community members and the police could work together to
address security and safety issues. Unfortunately, the federal
government will not recognize the resourcefulness of the Housing
Authority with grants to fund its community programs. Instead, HUD
recognizes only dollar signs when balancing its budget.</LD>

with leadership ability? My question is, what has Gov. Gray Davis
done for us, besides double our utility bills and give California a

<DL></DL>
<LD>The report of Israeli reservists protesting and questioning the
morality of Israeli military action in the occupied territories (Feb.
2) only serves to highlight the distinctive and moral character of
Israeli society. From this distance I cannot begin to agree or
disagree with the substance of the protests, but I applaud a society
in which such a debate can take place. Israelis live under the
constant threat of terrorism in ways we cannot begin to imagine and
yet they can tolerate, even encourage, these kinds of questions and
challenges.</LD>
<LD>   In no other Middle Eastern country can such a debate take place,
and even in Western democracies the prime minister or president would
not be considering meeting with those threatening to refuse military
orders. If for no other reason than this, Israeli society deserves
America's support and the admiration of people of tolerance and
democratic principles.</LD>

<TE>   The stand of the veteran Israeli reservists to reject duty in Gaza
and the West Bank is an act of courage and compassion. If the
Palestinians should respond in kind, it could start a people-driven
process to resolve a conflict that has lasted too long, vitally
affected the U.S. and is unlikely to be resolved with a lasting peace
agreement as long as Prime Minister Ariel Sharon's genocidal actions
and the Palestinians' murderous acts of desperation remain the only
intercourse between the two sides.</TE>

<TE>   Franklin Berger claimed that Israel has never targeted Palestinian
civilians (letter, Feb. 3). I would like to refute this wild remark
with a statement made by Adm. Ami Ayalon, former head of the Israeli
internal security service, Shin Bet. He is quoted (Feb. 2) that "too
few soldiers refused to carry out too many illegal orders. When we
kill unarmed children, that is an illegal order." Israel has targeted
and continues to target and kill Palestinian civilians at will.</TE>

<TE>   If President Bush is serious about brokering a peace agreement
between Israel and the Palestinians, he should balance his demands
from Yasser Arafat with a basic demand from Sharon. That is, a
commitment from Israel to end its occupation of all of the West Bank
(including East Jerusalem) and the Gaza Strip in return for a safe
and secure Israel. As an Arab American who voted for Bush to be our
president, I'd like to see him play the role of the honest broker; so
far he has not.</TE>

<LD>Glenn Sacks' "In Defense of John Walker Lindh's Parents" (Voices,

parent of a 20-ish son who is searching, rebelling and changing. I
feel our government has way overreacted, and to threaten to jail him
for life or even execute him is horrifying.</LD>
<LD>   I remember the '60s. The old men who govern our country now must
remember their own youth. I have read that our president drank too
much and was a party boy in college but has risen to the challenge of
recent events.</LD>

<TE>   I too believe that Johnny's parents deserve a little
sympathy--much like the sympathy afforded those whose children run
off and join a gang. It seems that there are certain similarities
between Johnny's deeds and that of any other gang member. The
differences, however, are very pronounced.</TE>
<TE>   Unfortunately, Johnny joined the mother of all gangs, with
super-murdering power and mega guns, so his problems are in just
proportion. Yet unlike the homies in my neighborhood, and luckily for
Johnny, his mom and dad can afford big-dollar attorneys. So who
knows? Maybe we'll see a glove at the trial, blame the LAPD and
Johnny can go play golf in Florida.</TE>

<HD>Clorox Profit Falls 20%, but Results Beat Estimates</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News and Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Clorox Co., the largest U.S. household-bleach maker, said fiscal
second-quarter profit fell 20% because of the costs of eliminating as
many as 585 jobs.</LD>
<LD>   Net income in the quarter ended Dec. 31 dropped to $51 million, or
22 cents a share, from $64 million, or 27 cents, a year earlier, the
maker of Glad bags and Kingsford charcoal said. Sales rose 2.9% to
$901 million from $876 million.</LD>
<LD>   Full-year earnings are estimated at $1.84 to $1.87 a share, the
upper end of a previous forecast range, because of cost cutting.
Clorox said it sold its Maxforce professional insecticide business as
part of a year-old review of the company's 100 brands. Chief
Executive Craig Sullivan also is increasing advertising to try to
accelerate sales.</LD>
<TE>   "They are making progress," said research director Franklin
Morton, who helps manage $7.5 billion at Ariel Capital Management,
which holds 1.5 million Clorox shares. "The majority of their
businesses are going in the right direction, which wasn't true 12
months ago."</TE>
<TE>   Before special charges, earnings were 39 cents a share. Analysts
had expected 35 cents.</TE>
<TE>   Shares of Oakland-based Clorox rose 95 cents to $42.35 on the New
York Stock Exchange.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Other California companies reporting earnings:</TE>
<TE>   * Cardiovascular device maker Edwards Lifesciences Corp. said
earnings rose 8%, benefiting from higher profit margins and lower
interest expense. The Irvine company's net income for the fourth
quarter jumped to $17.2 million, or 28 cents a share, from $15.9
million, or 26 cents, a year earlier. Sales fell 15% to $160.1
million.</TE>
<TE>   * TriZetto Group Inc., a Newport Beach provider of information
technology products and services for the health-care industry, posted
a fourth-quarter net loss of $16.6million, or 38 cents a share,
narrower than a year-earlier loss of $18 million, or 53 cents.
Revenue rose 80% to $61.6 million.</TE>

<LD>Chase Manhattan Mortgage Corp. has agreed to resolve a criminal slum
housing case brought by the city of Los Angeles by donating $100,000
to local nonprofit organizations and volunteering 10 employees and
executives to spend a day building homes with Habitat for Humanity.</LD>
<LD>   The Edison, N.J.-based J.P. Morgan Chase &amp; Co. subsidiary was
charged last August with failing to maintain a pair of vacant South
Los Angeles residential properties for several years after acquiring
them through foreclosures of federally insured loans.</LD>
<LD>   The mortgage lender pleaded no contest Tuesday to
building-and-safety code violations involving a duplex, which city
officials say was littered with trash and debris and repeatedly
broken into during a four-year period.</LD>
<TE>   In exchange, prosecutors dropped a second case involving an
apartment building and misdemeanor charges against two Chase
executives.</TE>
<TE>   The company spent more than $100,000 to clean up the two
properties, said spokeswoman Kristen Batteria. "Chase Manhattan
Mortgage Corp. is committed to continue to be a responsible corporate
citizen in the city of Los Angeles," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Under the plea agreement, Chase will pay more than $40,000 in
fines and penalties. It will donate $50,000 to the First African
Methodist Episcopal Church Housing Corp., $40,000 to a group that
teaches youths construction skills and $10,000 to the Los Angeles
Community Garden Council.</TE>
<TE>   The company, which was placed on two years' probation, also agreed
to create a California unit to streamline the processing of
foreclosed properties.</TE>
<TE>   City Atty. Rocky Delgadillo said about 38 foreclosed properties
owned by Chase were being reviewed for code violations in October
2000. They have since been brought up to code or sold, he said.</TE>

<HD>Disney Looks to Boost Adventure</HD>
<DH>Amusement: More attractions for children are part of a plan
to increase attendance at California-themed park after lackluster
first year.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BONNIE HARRIS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Gone are the quirky street performers and sheet-covered mimes who
used to surround visitors as they strolled through Disney's
California Adventure. A fast-paced, pelvis-thrusting dance show has
been axed. So has the much-hyped nightly parade that had leotard-clad
women shimmying up poles.</LD>
<LD>   In their place are a gang of Disney characters performing for
visitors, a tamed-down dance show based on a Broadway musical and the
return of Disney's wildly popular--and notably wholesome--Main Street
Electrical Parade.</LD>
<LD>   The changes weren't exactly what Walt Disney Co. executives
expected. But as Paul Pressler, chairman of Disney's Parks and
Resorts Division, acknowledged in a recent interview, it has been a
year of lessons for California Adventure.</LD>
<TE>   The 55-acre park opened in February 2001 as part of Disney's
$1.4-billion expansion of the Disneyland Resort in Anaheim. But beset
by the recession, the tourism slump after Sept. 11 and some problems
of its own making, California Adventure never came close to meeting
attendance projections, even after Disney offered unprecedented
discounts and made a series of changes to take some of the edge out
of what was billed as an edgier, hipper alternative to Disneyland.</TE>
<TE>   "I've watched [California Adventure] this past year like a proud
father who certainly has greater expectations and aspirations for his
son," Pressler said. And he isn't giving up on it.</TE>
<TE>   Pressler and other Disney executives are counting on boosting
crowds this year by adding more attractions for small children, among
other changes. And they are looking for a little help from the
economy and an improved tourism climate.</TE>
<TE>   "You build in a boom and you open in a bust. We've done better
than we thought without any Japanese tourists," Disney Chief
Executive Michael Eisner said in an interview last week, referring to
California Adventure's debut year. Eisner said Disney's amusement
parks are showing signs of recovery.</TE>
<TE>   But challenges abound. With air traffic still down, theme parks
overall are expected to show little, if any, growth this year.
Analysts say resorts that rely on out-of-state visitors, such as
those in Orlando, Fla., probably will struggle the most, while parks
that cater to locals, such as Six Flags Inc.'s Magic Mountain in
Valencia, will continue to benefit from Americans looking for
entertainment closer to home. California Adventure figures to fall
somewhere in between.</TE>
<TE>   New parks tend to see an attendance dip in the second year--what
industry analysts call a "sophomore slump" that usually follows the
hype and curiosity of a theme park's opening year. Disney's original
projections for California Adventure were for 7 million visitors a
year. But the trade publication Amusement Business put the figure at
5 million for 2001, compared with more than 12 million visitors at
Disneyland.</TE>
<TE>   Pressler dismissed suggestions that California Adventure's
sophomore year will be slower, saying that when a park opens in a
year like 2001, "all the rules go out the window."</TE>
<TE>   "Our parks traditionally see growth year over year," he said.</TE>
<TE>   California Adventure already has added a new attraction based on
the television show "Who Wants to Be a Millionaire," and industry
watchers say that by this fall, the It's a Bug's Life attraction
probably will be turned into an area of rides and shows for young
children.</TE>
<TE>   "We basically come over here for the food, because the food's way
better," said longtime Disneyland pass holder Cheryl Rivera, who
braved the cold weather on a recent weekday with her husband and
4-year-old daughter for lunch at California Adventure's Fisherman's
Wharf section.</TE>
<TE>   "But there's not much else here that holds my daughter's
attention," she said. "This is a park I want to come to when there's
a baby-sitter at home."</TE>
<TE>   Disney has responded to such reviews by fine-tuning the park. By
last summer, the popular Main Street Electrical Parade was pulled
from retirement and delivered to California Adventure. In the fall,
when Wolfgang Puck Food Co.'s upscale seafood eatery Avalon Cove
pulled out of the park, Disney turned the space into a casual
restaurant where visitors can interact with Mickey and other
characters.</TE>
<TE>   "We thought we'd limit Disney characters to the more traditional
Disneyland experience," Pressler said. "But lo and behold, our guests
said they wanted the characters everywhere. These are things we
didn't anticipate, but we read them loud and clear."</TE>
<TE>   Another common gripe is that with about two dozen attractions,
including exhibits, California Adventure remains short on thrills.
But there is word that a Tower of Terror attraction--copied from the
popular thrill ride at Walt Disney World--will arrive at California
Adventure in two years. Disney representatives would not comment, but
they are expected this week to announce new attractions.</TE>
<TE>   Disney executives point out that California Adventure is an anchor
for the overall Disneyland Resort, which includes a luxury hotel and
a retail entertainment center--and that it takes time to influence
consumer behavior. Disneyland Resort President Cynthia Harriss said
guest surveys routinely have given the new park more than a 90%
approval rating.</TE>
<TE>   Hoteliers and other businesses in Anaheim whose fates are tied to
the Disneyland Resort are counting on an increase in domestic
tourists, although future bookings from foreign visitors remain down.
Anaheim's convention center says it is expecting 1 million to 1.1
million visitors this year, up from 960,000 in 2001.</TE>
<TE>   But as California Adventure heads into its second year, the issue
may have less to do with recession woes and more with the public's
perception of the new park.</TE>
<TE>   "This has put them way behind, because California Adventure is
still not on people's must-see list," said Jim Cammisa Jr., an
analyst at Travel Industry Indicators in Miami.</TE>
<TE>   Tim O'Brien, a senior editor for Amusement Business, said he
believes Disney can overcome the sophomore slump.</TE>
<TE>   "They may have fallen short attendance-wise their first year, but
they're not going to let this thing fail," he said. "It needs the
buzz, it needs more family offerings, but it will click on. There's
still time."</TE>

<HD>Enron Team Says Lay Took Some Blame</HD>
<DH>Hearings: Former chief admits lapse in oversight, according
to internal investigator questioned by lawmakers.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD SIMON and EDMUND SANDERS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Former Enron Corp. Chairman Kenneth L. Lay acknowledged to company
investigators that he should have kept a closer eye on  the energy
trader's financial operations, but he also pointed the finger at
subordinates, the head of the company's internal investigation told
Congress on Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   "I think he felt he had not been watching carefully enough, but he
certainly felt he had been betrayed," said William C. Powers, whose
team interviewed Lay as part of a recently released report examining
the company's collapse.</LD>
<LD>   Meanwhile, lawmakers grilled Joseph F. Berardino, the head of
Enron's former outside auditor, Andersen, for destroying thousands of
documents related to Enron and for helping to create some of the
off-the-books partnerships that led to Enron's demise.</LD>
<TE>   "Your company helped set these up," said Rep. Paul E. Kanjorski
(D-Pa.). "You're not some innocent coming in here as an auditor and
having all these transactions that are out there and you're just
looking at them. You went through the intellectual analysis of how to
do these things."</TE>
<TE>   House and Senate committees still want to hear directly from Lay,
issuing subpoenas Tuesday for him to appear next week. He and another
star witness--former Chief Financial Officer Andrew S. Fastow, who
has been asked to appear on Thursday--are expected to invoke their
5th Amendment right against self-incrimination.</TE>
<TE>   Lay was summoned to appear Feb. 12 before the Senate Commerce
Committee and Feb. 14 before the House Financial Services
subcommittee on capital markets.</TE>
<TE>   Lay spokeswoman Kelly Kimberly, asked about whether Lay would
invoke the 5th, said, "He is still determining his strategy for how
to handle the hearings."</TE>
<TE>   Unable to hear from Lay, members of the House Energy and Commerce
subcommittee on oversight and investigations sought to find out from
Powers, dean of the University of Texas law school who joined Enron's
board last fall, exactly what the former Enron chief knew and when he
knew it.</TE>
<TE>   The Houston-based energy company--once one of the nation's largest
and best-connected corporations--sought bankruptcy protection Dec. 2
amid questions about its accounting practices. Less than a month
before filing for Chapter 11, Enron revealed previously unreported
losses of $586 million over the previous 4 1/2 years.</TE>
<TE>   Powers, whose team spent four hours interviewing Lay during its
internal probe, said Lay was aware Enron was using company stock to
hedge against investment losses.</TE>
<TE>   "He didn't understand or appreciate that there was anything wrong
with that," Powers told the committee. "I don't know whether that's
credible. That's his story." Lawmakers said they hope to secure notes
of Powers' interviews of Lay and other senior officials.</TE>
<TE>   Powers' 203-page report, released late Saturday, concluded that
accounting abuses masked more than $1 billion in losses in a one-year
period and assigned widespread blame to Enron management, accounting
firm Andersen, company lawyers and Enron's board for creating--and
then failing to oversee--a series of partnerships that sparked the
company's bankruptcy filing. The report noted that Lay, a major
fund-raiser for President Bush, was "captain of the ship" for most of
the time that abuses were occurring and "bears significant
responsibility for ... flawed decisions" of subordinates.</TE>
<TE>   Powers said the Enron investigating team also met briefly with
Fastow, but "very little information was forthcoming"--a sign of the
challenge before Congress in grilling the man who is regarded as the
expert on the partnerships.</TE>
<TE>   Powers told the committee that Andersen stopped cooperating with
Enron's internal investigation once the company fired the accounting
firm, saying the auditors had destroyed documents sought by
government investigators.</TE>
<TE>   But Andersen's chairman, Berardino, said the firm offered to
assist Powers but was not contacted by his team after the Jan. 17
firing.</TE>
<TE>   At his second appearance before a House Financial Services
subcommittee, Berardino offered few new details about why Andersen
destroyed documents and failed to warn investors about Enron's
questionable accounting practices.</TE>
<TE>   Asked about the shredding, Berardino said, "I'm embarrassed by
what happened at my firm."</TE>
<TE>   But Berardino repeatedly said he did not know the details of
Andersen's business dealings with Enron, whether Andersen employees
knew about problems or what documents were destroyed. "How could you
not know?" asked Rep. Richard H. Baker (R-La.).</TE>
<TE>   "Maybe it's better to be dumb than culpable, but we want some
answers," said Rep. Gary L. Ackerman (D-N.Y.).</TE>
<TE>   Andersen has not completed its own internal investigation into the
Enron matter.  Berardino disputed allegations in the Powers report
that the firm was instrumental in creating some of the questionable
partnerships. "It's not like we were running around town shopping
these things," he said. He said Andersen merely reviewed proposals
made by Enron managers.</TE>
<TE>   At a separate House hearing, Rep. W.J. "Billy" Tauzin (R-La.),
chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, said that
congressional investigators were finding that "there was no
legitimate purpose in the construction of some of these deals except
in the defrauding of investors."</TE>
<TE>   Investigators also have found that "some [investment] banks were
told they'd get special bond deals if they would put the money up for
some of the partnerships," Tauzin said.</TE>
<TE>   A Tauzin spokesman declined to elaborate.</TE>

<HD>Filing Stops Ex-Global Employees' Severance</HD>
<DH>Retirement: Current and former workers worry about losses
in 401(k)s and other benefits.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KAREN KAPLAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>By the time Global Crossing Ltd. filed for bankruptcy last week, Alan
Moffatt had already come to accept a $50,000 loss on the company's
stock and a 60% drop in the value of his retirement plan.</LD>
<LD>   What he didn't expect was that four months after being laid off by
the struggling telecommunications firm, the final indignity was yet
to come. Global Crossing's bankruptcy, the fifth-largest in U.S.
history, brought his severance payments to a sudden halt.</LD>
<LD>   Across the country, Global Crossing shareholders are absorbing the
financial shock of watching their stock become instantly worthless
and employees are fretting about the damage to their
company-sponsored 401(k) plans.</LD>
<TE>   Thousands of laid-off workers are having to digest those losses
while finding ways to make ends meet without the severance benefits
they had been promised.</TE>
<TE>   The unexpected loss of income has brought the workers a sudden
degree of hardship and uncertainty at a time when much of their stock
savings have already evaporated and jobs in the telecommunications
field are notoriously scarce. The telecom industry shed more than
175,000 U.S. positions last year.</TE>
<TE>   Moffatt, the company's former vice president of sales for the
Pacific Northwest, has spent the last 10 days searching for ways to
make do without the severance check and health benefits that were
worth nearly $18,000 a month.</TE>
<TE>   "We're taking a closer look at everything," said Moffatt, who
lives in the Seattle suburb of Bellevue and counted on the severance
for 80% of his family's income. "We're strongly considering putting
our house on the market, all because of the bankruptcy."</TE>
<TE>   Global Crossing, which now has 8,000 employees, has laid off more
than 2,000 workers since the summer, and nearly all of them were
offered severance packages. The company doesn't know how many of them
had their payments interrupted by the bankruptcy filing.</TE>
<TE>   In a letter posted on Global Crossing's Web site, John Comparin,
executive vice president for human resources, told "recently
separated employees" that bankruptcy laws prohibit the company from
continuing its severance payments without approval from the U.S.
Bankruptcy Court. The company has not asked for permission.</TE>
<TE>   Global Crossing's bankruptcy filing puts severed employees in the
same category as creditors like Lucent Technologies Inc., which
claims to be owed at least $123 million. Bankruptcy attorneys predict
the ex-workers will see only pennies on the dollar.</TE>
<TE>   Bankruptcy law allows for employees to collect up to $4,300 for
back pay, commissions, severance, unreimbursed expenses and the like,
before the rest of the company's assets are divided up among
creditors, said Kenneth Klee, a bankruptcy expert at UCLA law school.</TE>
<TE>   When large companies file for Chapter 11 protection, former
employees usually get their full $4,300 in priority claims, though
not the rest of the severance they are owed, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Global Crossing could have ensured that the laid-off workers
received their full severance benefits by paying them in a single
lump sum, said Melanie Cohen, a Chicago bankruptcy attorney and past
chairwoman of the nonprofit Turnaround Management Assn.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, they will be considered alongside other unsecured
creditors.</TE>
<TE>   "If they had wanted these people to have some money, they could
have found a way to do it," Cohen said. Now, "it's really up to the
bankruptcy judge. There's just not enough to go around."</TE>
<TE>   Global Crossing preferred to spread the payments out so that
laid-off workers could continue receiving health insurance at
employee rates, said spokeswoman Tisha Kresler.</TE>
<TE>   To former employees like John Sidline, the well-intentioned plan
now seems ill-conceived. The loss of his severance--a five-digit
figure that was to be paid over a year--is making a bigger financial
impact these days than the loss he took on the company's stock.</TE>
<TE>   "It hurts," said Sidline, a Global Crossing public relations and
product manager who was let go in July and has been supporting his
wife and two young daughters since then on his severance. "We're
reacquainting ourselves with tuna fish. We're making sure the heat's
not up to 70 in the house. We're tightening our belts where we can."</TE>
<TE>   Sidline invested nearly $10,000 in now worthless company stock. He
left well over $100,000 on the table as he waited in vain for the
share price to hit $70 so he could cash in his stock options.</TE>
<TE>   But the stock options were only "potential money," and the cash
spent on shares "was already paid." As the stock price fell, he
reduced the proportion of his 401(k) that was invested in Global
Crossing to 5%, down from a high of 25%.</TE>
<TE>   Since the bankruptcy filing, Sidline also widened his job search
and is now willing to consider  jobs with lower salaries, outside his
area of expertise, and farther from his home in Lake Oswego, Ore.</TE>
<TE>   "I never had that sense of urgency because of the severance," he
said. "Now I'm going to take whatever job comes along that will pay
the bills."</TE>
<TE>   Leonard Maggiore, who was laid off from Global Crossing's
Sunnyvale, Calif., office in August and is owed more than $43,000 in
promised severance, said forcing workers to share the burden with
corporate creditors is unfair.</TE>
<TE>   "Companies like Lucent and Cisco can sustain this kind of loss
with minimal impact," said Maggiore, who was a senior product line
manager. "They're slapping a lot of people who spent hours building
their network, talking to customers and advocating for the company.
Those are the people they should be most concerned about."</TE>
<TE>   Maggiore is using the Internet to gather a virtual community of
former Global Crossing employees so they can devise a strategy to
fight for their severances in court.</TE>
<TE>   "Clearly I can't afford my own lawyer to pursue this," he said.
"We need to fight for what's ours because the courts aren't."</TE>

<HD>Settlement Gives Family $14.9 Million</HD>
<DH>Courts: Ford Explorer's rollover accident claimed unborn
child and left mother-to-be a paraplegic. Ford says jury exonerated
it.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MYRON LEVIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A Newport Beach couple who were severely injured in the rollover of
their Ford Explorer concluded a $14.9-million settlement Tuesday as
the damages phase of their trial was about to start.</LD>
<LD>   A superior court jury in Barstow ruled last week that the family's
1994 Explorer was defectively designed, the first time a jury
anywhere had found the SUV had a design defect due to its risk of
rolling over. However, the jury also absolved Ford of responsibility
for the wreck, diluting the significance of the defect finding.</LD>
<LD>   Under the settlement reached Tuesday, plaintiffs Agop and
Catherine Gozukara will get $9.4 million from Joe McPherson Ford of
Tustin, which sold the used Explorer and, according to evidence in
the case, failed to make proper repairs. Late last year, the
Gozukaras reached a $5.5-million settlement with the California
Department of Transportation and a highway construction firm, said
Garo Mardirossian, a lawyer for the family.</LD>
<TE>   Settlement terms often are kept secret, but Mardirossian said
Tuesday that he and his clients had refused a confidentiality
agreement. "We want everyone that's been injured in a Ford Explorer
to know that these vehicles have a dangerous propensity to roll over
under foreseeable and reasonable circumstances," he said.</TE>
<TE>   But Ford declared victory. The jury "totally exonerated Ford for
the rollover accident and the ensuing injuries," said William J.
Conroy, Ford's lead attorney in the case. "That's the bottom line on
where we are with this."</TE>
<TE>   The Gozukaras were driving through Barstow with their two sons and
a nephew on their way to Las Vegas in May 1997 when the Explorer
began to shake and pulled to the left, hitting a concave concrete
barrier, known as a "K wall." After running part of the way up the
barrier, the Explorer flipped over and rolled several times.</TE>
<TE>   The Gozukaras were thrown from the vehicle, along with two of the
children. The children were not badly hurt, but Catherine Gozukara,
then 35, broke her back and became a paraplegic. Pregnant at the
time, she also lost her baby.</TE>
<TE>   Agop Gozukara, the driver, suffered severe leg fractures and still
has trouble walking.</TE>
<TE>   According to evidence in the case, the Gozukaras had purchased the
Explorer with 48,000 miles on it three months before the wreck. They
repeatedly brought it back to the dealer because of a vibration
problem, which they said was never properly fixed.</TE>
<TE>   They also sued Caltrans and one of its contractors over design of
the stretch of highway and for placing the concrete barrier too near
to traffic lanes.</TE>
<TE>   Although the jury last Thursday found the Explorer was defectively
designed, to hold Ford liable for the injuries the panel would have
had to decide that the defect caused the injuries. Instead, the jury
found, any vehicle could flip if it ran up a K wall. And, according
to the verdict, McPherson's negligence is what caused that to happen.
A lawyer for the dealership did not return phone calls.</TE>
<TE>   Craig McLellan, a San Diego lawyer, said the verdict still may
influence Ford's defense strategy. He pointed out that the defect
finding came even though certain facts in the case were highly
favorable to Ford, including that the Gozukaras weren't wearing seat
belts.</TE>
<TE>   "It doesn't mean that a jury in Omaha is going to know about it
[the defect finding]," said McLellan. But "I think it's got to be a
concern to Ford."</TE>
<TE>   Last Friday, McLellan reached an undisclosed settlement of his own
Explorer rollover case after three weeks of trial. The case was
brought by the family of Felicia Lajeunesse, who became a paraplegic
in a rollover wreck in December 1999. McLellan said his negotiations
with Ford were underway when the Barstow verdict came in, and that
Ford then agreed to meet his terms.</TE>

<HD>GE Could Set Example on Disclosure</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>James Flanigan</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>General Electric Co. may be getting ready to give skeptical investors
more disclosure about the accounting behind its earnings increases
and about GE Capital Services, the huge financial services division
that accounts for more than 40% of the giant corporation's profit.</LD>
<LD>   It would be an important move for GE, which has seen its once
highly regarded stock slump almost 12% this year and more than 30% in
the last 52 weeks because institutional investors complained that its
accounting revealed little of how the company made its profit or how
heavily indebted GE Capital really was.</LD>
<LD>   A lot could be riding on greater disclosure by GE. It is one of
only nine U.S. companies with a triple-A credit rating, a status that
allows the firm to borrow at lower rates than almost all other
companies. Intensifying skepticism about the firm could endanger that
credit rating, although Moody's Investors Service and Standard &amp;
Poor's Corp. are not conducting any extraordinary review of GE at
this time.</LD>
<TE>   Also, GE--the biggest U.S. company by stock market value--could
set an example of clear, forthright accounting for corporate America
if it opened up to investors, some analysts say.</TE>
<TE>   GE didn't address those questions Tuesday. But Jeffrey Immelt, its
chief executive, issued new reassurances.</TE>
<TE>   "GE isn't a 'faith' stock; it's a performance stock. We have
tremendous financial strength and a system of controllership that is
second to none," Immelt said in a statement released at GE
headquarters in Fairfield, Conn.</TE>
<TE>   Immelt, who has held the CEO's job for five months, has been
forced lately to make a lot of defensive statements about GE. Last
weekend in London, where he addressed the company's employees in
Britain, the 43-year-old executive defended GE's complex corporate
structure and accounting but said GE may disclose more financial
details in the annual report for 2001, which it will issue the second
week in March.</TE>
<TE>   GE stock, which had been beaten down steadily in recent trading
sessions, recovered Tuesday to $36.21 a share, up $1.21 on the New
York Stock Exchange, after Immelt restated his earlier prediction
that GE earnings for 2002 would rise 17% to $1.65 a share from $1.41
in 2001.</TE>
<TE>   However, the 17% figure overstates the true growth rate of the
company's eight major businesses, which include aircraft engines, the
NBC television network, insurance, leasing and worldwide lending.
Earnings get a boost this year from a new accounting rule that says
companies no longer have to deduct excess payments made for
acquisitions--"goodwill," in accounting terms.</TE>
<TE>   "Back out that accounting change, and GE's underlying growth rate
is about 10%," said analyst William Fiala of brokerage firm Edward
Jones &amp; Co.</TE>
<TE>   If huge GE, which last year had $125.7 billion in revenue and
$14billion in profit, can grow 10% in this economy, that wouldn't be
a puny accomplishment, Fiala said. But in the post-Enron climate,
investors want clearer information on just how GE does it.</TE>
<TE>   Sophisticated investors say GE Capital, which had more than $66
billion in revenue and $5.5 billion in profit on its own last year,
is central to the steadily increasing earnings that won GE renown
under just-retired CEO Jack Welch.</TE>
<TE>   GE Capital, at $425 billion in assets, is one of the largest
financial companies in the world. GE started it to help its customers
finance purchases of GE's appliances, aircraft engines, power plants
and other products. But it now also provides insurance, finances
consumer loans, provides leasing of aircraft and other products and
performs other financial functions, taking market share from banks.</TE>
<TE>   But it is not regulated as are banks and some other lending
institutions. Thus it has many advantages. GE Capital was able to buy
distressed real estate in the recession of the early '90s and wait to
profit from an upturn in values, says analyst Richard Schmidt of
Standard &amp; Poor's. A regulated finance company or bank would have to
get nonperforming loans and real estate off its books.</TE>
<TE>   In a similar move, GE Capital bought enormous amounts of junk
bonds when those securities were at their low point and has been able
to feed profit into parent GE's reported accounts over a decade, says
an expert in the high-yield securities.</TE>
<TE>   As GE Capital has grown into a global finance company, it has
acquired financial companies in Japan, which can borrow at almost
zero interest from the Bank of Japan and profit hugely by lending in
other countries. It was car loans in Thailand that first alerted Jack
Welch to the "immense opportunity" GE Capital represented, Welch
wrote in his best-selling autobiography, "Jack."</TE>
<TE>   In turn, parent GE has injected $1.5 billion of capital into the
financial subsidiary in the early '90s, demonstrating its explicit
backing of the division's finances. GE Capital enjoys the parent
company's triple-A credit rating.</TE>
<TE>   The point about GE Capital is that in the wake of Enron Corp.'s
collapse amid bizarre accounting abuses, investors are concerned
about a finance division that can feed earnings increases into a vast
industrial company. Yesterday, analysts and investors may have
praised GE's financial ingenuity. But today they are questioning the
almost seamless success that the giant firm has demonstrated for
almost two decades. Does GE represent solid industrial progress or
only sophisticated financial maneuvers in a global market? they ask.</TE>
<TE>   So GE is challenged to increase disclosure. Analyst Fiala sees it
as an opportunity for the firm to dispel doubts about itself and to
"set the new standard for other firms."</TE>
<TE>   Analyst Nicholas Heymann of Prudential Financial says GE has been
here before. "Often when unilateral concern about GE's fundamentals
hits a peak--as when problems developed at [its Kidder Peabody
brokerage unit] during the mid-1990s--the stock has been misvalued
versus the market," Heymann writes in an analysis of GE.</TE>
<TE>   He and many analysts do not doubt GE, but then most investment
analysts didn't doubt Enron until it was much too late.</TE>
<TE>   The bottom line is that Immelt and GE will have to increase
disclosure. Because if they do not clear up questions about the
firm's accounting, institutional investors may drive the stock down
and demand a breakup of the complex, century-old landmark company.</TE>

<HD>Brewers, Distillers Seek to Sweeten Spirit Sales With Malt
Beverages</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GREG JOHNSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Brewing king Anheuser-Busch Cos. and rum importer Bacardi U.S.A. on
Tuesday jumped into the fast-growing market for ''malternative''
beverages, a small but fast-moving category that promises to put the
fizz back into relatively flat beer sales.</LD>
<LD>   The new Bacardi Silver brand will compete against segment leader
Smirnoff Ice, Mike's Hard Lemonade and other malt-alternative
beverages pushing for space in bars and restaurants and on retailers'
shelves.</LD>
<LD>   Malt-based alternatives--industry insiders call them
malternatives--have about the same alcohol content as a bottle of
beer. These drinks aren't your father's brew or cocktail.
Anheuser-Busch describes Bacardi Silver as "very light, refreshing,
crisp and clean." The Smirnoff Ice drink is a clear liquid with a
sweet flavor and a slight touch of citrus.</LD>
<TE>   The segment clearly is heating up; Miller Brewing Co. and
Britain's Allied Dome last month announced plans to market malt-based
beverages carrying offshoots of the Stolichnaya vodka and Sauza
tequila brands.</TE>
<TE>   The category, which didn't even exist two years ago, accounted for
2% of the 202 million barrels that U.S. brewers shipped in 2001. That
might not sound like much, but last year's shipments translated into
69 million cases, or 1.6 billion bottles, according to Beverage
Marketing Corp. By contrast, wine coolers took years to reach a peak
of between 60 million to 70 million cases in the late-1980s, the New
York-based market research firm noted.</TE>
<TE>   Anheuser-Busch, Miller and other beverage companies clearly are
scrambling to connect with the taste buds of consumers in their 20s
who grew up sipping fruit-flavored drinks, carbonated beverages and
energy concoctions.</TE>
<TE>   "The big guys are coming at the category because it's proven, it's
not just a fad," said Santa Barbara-based beverage industry
consultant Tom Pirko. "Now they're going to fight it out."</TE>
<TE>   Why are brewers leading the charge? Despite the "lemonade,"
"Smirnoff" or "Bacardi" on the label, the malternatives generally get
their alcoholic kick from a malt-based brewing process.</TE>
<TE>   The formula now calls for a popular spirits brand to hook up with
a brewer. Smirnoff Ice, for example, is owned by Diageo, which also
owns the Guinness brand.</TE>
<TE>   Anheuser-Busch is licensing Bacardi's familiar name and "bat
wing'' logo for the new Bacardi Silver beverage. In addition to Sauza
and Stolichnaya, Miller also has struck a deal with Skyy vodka to
market a Skyy Blue malt-alternative.</TE>
<TE>   Beverage industry observers admit that the blending of brewing and
distilling can be confusing.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think most people have a clue about what they're
drinking," said Don Brown, a vice president at the Concord,
Calif.-based Beverages &amp; More Inc. retail chain, which reports strong
demand for the new beverages. "But I guess it doesn't matter because
they seem to taste good."</TE>
<TE>   Brewers clearly have self-interest at heart.</TE>
<TE>   "Beer sales haven't been doing as well as most people were
expecting, so the possibility that the younger consumer is in fact
looking for some sort of [malt-based] alternative is causing quite a
bit of excitement," said Eric Shephard, executive editor of Beer
Marketer's Insights, a Nanuet, N.Y.-based newsletter.</TE>
<TE>   Logistics and tax codes also enter the marketing equation. Brewers
have the distribution systems needed to get the new products into bar
and restaurants and grocery stores.</TE>
<TE>   Distillers also are subject to higher taxes, which makes it
difficult to bring product to market at affordable price points.</TE>
<TE>   The growing category is sparking an advertising war.
Anheuser-Busch is earmarking $60 million to market Bacardi Silver.
Miller will spend $50 million to develop and market its beverages,
and Diageo reportedly spent $50 million in 2001 to market Smirnoff
Ice.</TE>

<HD>Ban on MTBE Induces Suit Using NAFTA Provision</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>EVELYN IRITANI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Santa Monica city officials had no idea they would trigger an
international legal brawl when they sent their water out for routine
testing in 1996 and discovered it contained the foul-smelling
gasoline additive MTBE.</LD>
<LD>   Formally known as methyl tertiary butyl ether, MTBE was banned by
California because of its perceived threat to humans and the water
supply. But what began as an environmental issue took a twist into
international trade when a Canadian firm contested the state order
under a provision of the North American Free Trade Agreement.</LD>
<LD>   In the first such case involving a challenge to a U.S.
environmental measure, Methanex Corp., the world's largest producer
of methanol, a primary ingredient in MTBE, claims Gov. Gray Davis
acted in a protectionist manner by imposing a ban that harmed foreign
methanol producers and benefited Archer-Daniels-Midland Co., a
campaign donor and domestic maker of a competing fuel additive,
ethanol.</LD>
<TE>   Saying its investors were hurt, Methanex is demanding nearly
$970million in damages because of the MTBE phaseout, slated to be
completed by 2003.</TE>
<TE>   Investors can only sue for compensation and cannot force a
government to change a law. But experts say a multimillion-dollar
award in the Methanex case could have a chilling effect by
discouraging federal or state governments from considering similar
measures. More than a dozen states are considering action to restrict
the use of MTBE.</TE>
<TE>   The case also has become a cause celebre for globalization critics
who argue the case underscores their concern that free trade
agreements give companies too much power and undermines the sovereign
rights of governments to protect their citizens.</TE>
<TE>   The Methanex case, brought in 1999 under NAFTA's Chapter 11 which
allows foreign investors to sue a government for violating their
trading rights, is pending before a three-member tribunal in
Washington. A decision is expected soon on whether the tribunal has
jurisdiction in a case that could take years to work its way to
resolution.</TE>
<TE>   If Methanex is victorious, the firm hopes the U.S. would take
steps to remove the prohibitions on MTBE, according to Jim Emmerton,
a Methanex senior vice president.</TE>
<TE>   He argued that the European Union recently gave the green light to
MTBE after determining that it did not pose a public health or
environmental risk.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Methanex's Maker Says Product Isn't Dangerous</TE>
<TE>   "We would hope the U.S. would look at what other jurisdictions are
doing," he said. "MTBE is not a threat to human health and it is not
a threat to the environment if it'shandled carefully."</TE>
<TE>   Archer-Daniels-Midland, also known as ADM, did not respond to a
request for comment on the Methanex accusations. "The governor sets
policies based on science and facts concerned with the issue,"
according to David Chai, a spokesman for the governor. "Ethanol
clearly is not getting favorable treatment in the state of
California."</TE>
<TE>   "Methanex is grasping at straws," said William L. Rukeyser,
assistant secretary at Cal-EPA. "If the record is reviewed, you can
see that MTBE regardless of the manufacturer is bad for California.
That decision is based on science and science alone carries the day."</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. government, the defendant in the NAFTA case, termed
Methanex's charge "absurd" and warned that a positive ruling for the
company could hurt the ability of the U.S., Canada and Mexico to
protect public health and the environment, according to court
filings.</TE>
<TE>   "No NAFTA party could carry out its most fundamental government
functions unless it were prepared to pay for each and every economic
impact occasioned by doing so," said the U.S. government in its
Methanex filing. "The NAFTA parties never intended the NAFTA to bring
about such a radical change in the way they function and Methanex
cannot show otherwise."</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. is in an awkward position, having been the most vocal
proponent of the so-called investor-state dispute mechanism. These
provisions are designed to give multinationals an independent arbiter
for disputes in countries where the governments and courts are weak
or corrupt. U.S. officials are pushing to have Chapter 11-style
investor protections in the proposed Free Trade Area of the Americas
that would extend NAFTA throughout South America.</TE>
<TE>   In Santa Monica, which has been forced to shut down more than half
of its water supply and spend an additional $3 million a year to
purchase untainted water, officials say they are incredulous that
NAFTA has opened the door to a challenge from the north.</TE>
<TE>   "The state's MTBE law was a prudent and measured effort made to
phase out a chemical that had proven to be harmful or potentially
harmful," said Assistant City Atty. Joel Lawrence.</TE>
<TE>   "The thanks you get from this is a claim from a Canadian
manufacturer that somehow it has the birthright to produce and force
this stuff down the gas pipes of California residents and down their
digestive tracts as well," Lawrence said.</TE>
<TE>   MTBE was adopted as a fuel additive two decades ago to reduce air
pollution but was later found to be a suspected carcinogen that seeps
into the groundwater through leaking gas tanks or gas spills. Even in
extremely small amounts, the chemical can make water smell and taste
like turpentine. Hundreds of millions of dollars have been spent
removing MTBE from the nation's soil and water.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. hasn't been on the losing side in a Chapter 11 case,
though it has only faced three claims so far.</TE>
<TE>   Barry Bosworth, a trade expert at the Washington-based Brookings
Institution, warned a loss in the Methanex case could spark a "big
public conflict" because it involves an attack on a popular
environmental measure. Concern over these investor provisions have
arisen in the congressional debate over a bill to give the president
fast-track negotiating authority for future trade agreements since
NAFTA was enacted.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Previous Challenges to NAFTA Regulations</TE>
<TE>   Fifteen Chapter 11 cases have been filed since NAFTA was enacted.
Of those, the companies prevailed in four cases, lost one and the
remainder are still pending. Canada, the leading target, has lost
several cases involving challenges of environmental regulations.</TE>
<TE>   In the last two months, Kenex Ltd., an Ontario, Canada-based
producer of hemp products, has threatened to file a NAFTA Chapter 11
case against the U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency for its ban on foods
containing hemp and Crompton Corp., a Greenwich, Conn.-based chemical
firm, and Dallas-based Trammell Crow Co. have filed
multimillion-dollar complaints in Canada.</TE>
<TE>   The rise in Chapter 11 cases and large awards have sparked concern
even among the creators of NAFTA. After reviewing the process, the
NAFTA governments last July issued an "interpretation" of the Chapter
11 provision that would, in effect, make it harder for foreign firms
to prove unfair or discriminatory treatment, according to Todd
Weiler, a Canadian law professor and NAFTA consultant.</TE>
<TE>   As the battle over the Chapter 11 heats up, it is also moving
through the courts. Canada has filed a federal lawsuit challenging
S.D. Myers' successful NAFTA complaint against that government's ban
on the export of PCBs, a toxic chemical. Myers had claimed $20million
in damages. Canadian citizen groups are in court trying to join the
government in the federal lawsuit and have also filed a separate
constitutional challenge of the Chapter 11 process.</TE>
<TE>   "Our strategy is to make sure when tribunals do award in favor of
foreign investors, the cases are appealed all the way up through the
entire process so what is a speedy way to extract money from
governments becomes drawn out and difficult," said Steven Shrybman,
an Ottawa, Canada, environmental attorney who is involved in those
cases.</TE>

<HD>Corporate Sponsorship Reaches All-Time High at Winter Games</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GREG JOHNSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Shortly after the Olympic torch is lighted this Friday in Salt Lake
City, the real competition will begin as Winter Games corporate
sponsors battle for their money's worth.</LD>
<LD>   Bank of America will be offering safe deposit boxes to athletes
who win medals. Campbell Soup Co. will ladle chicken noodle soup from
steaming caldrons in the Olympic village. Office Depot will sell
computer disks and stationery to athletes and journalists. Visitors
and athletes in Salt Lake City will find everything from an official
milk (Smith's) to an official champagne (Korbel).</LD>
<LD>   The stakes are high because the Salt Lake City Games boast 64
corporate sponsors and suppliers that are contributing $859 million
in cash, goods and services. That's an all-time high, a noticeable
jump from the $480 million raised before the 1996 Summer Games in
Atlanta and from the $140 million raised for the 1984 Summer Games in
Los Angeles, when the Olympic movement for the first time
aggressively courted corporate sponsors to fund the Games.</LD>
<TE>   Why is corporate America so enthusiastically grabbing for the
colorful Olympic rings?</TE>
<TE>   Even during a recession, the "citius, altius, fortius" Olympic
motto remains in sync with the corporate world's mantra of faster,
higher, stronger. The Olympic focus on continuous improvement "is
something that people easily identify with, and it links very nicely
with what we're saying about Office Depot," said Bruce Nelson,
chairman and chief executive of the office-supply chain that recently
signed on as an Olympic sponsor.</TE>
<TE>   The Academy Awards and the Super Bowl grab consumers for a few
hours. But Olympic broadcasts promise a broad demographic that
returns day after day, creating a perfect window for big corporations
with multiple audiences.</TE>
<TE>   EDS, for example, will use NBC's broadcasts to court potential
customers: MBA and engineering students who soon will be looking for
jobs, Wall Street analysts and the company's 142,000 employees.</TE>
<TE>   Advertisers and NBC are banking on a patriotic swell to boost
viewership.</TE>
<TE>   "This year, it's more important than ever to people in terms of
patriotism and rooting for America, both on the athletic field and
the battlefield," said M. Dockery Clark, manager of sports and events
marketing for Bank of America. Corporate sponsorships came into their
own for the 1984 Games, when businessman Peter Ueberroth aggressively
solicited corporate financial support. The Olympic movement's
dependence upon corporate sponsors grew during subsequent Games as
governments proved unable or unwilling to finance construction of
venues. Corporate dollars also are at the heart of training centers
constructed for Olympic-level athletes.</TE>
<TE>   There's little talk in corporate circles of the late-1990s scandal
involving Salt Lake City's bid to host the Winter Games. "Sure, it
caused me to stop and think," Office Depot's Nelson said. "But I was
satisfied that the scandal wouldn't taint the Games because [Olympic
leaders] addressed the issues head on."</TE>
<TE>   The scandal's shadow isn't likely to be anywhere near as much of a
factor as the uncertain global economy or the fact that the Games
won't return to U.S. soil for more than a decade.</TE>
<TE>   "The Olympics always come down to the athletes, their hopes,
dreams and aspirations," Bank of America's Clark said.</TE>
<TE>   The flow of sponsorship and advertising dollars supports that
theory. Olympic organizers don't discuss specifics of corporate
involvement, but sponsorships give both big and small companies a
chance to grab the Olympic rings.</TE>
<TE>   Eastman Kodak, Visa, John Hancock and seven other corporations
paid between $50 million and $60 million for worldwide rights,
according to the U.S. Olympic Committee. One rung lower are General
Motors, Bank of America, Delta Air Lines and 20 other contributors
that pledged at least $20 million for rights to use Olympic marks.
Several dozen companies, including Herman Miller, General Mills and
Kleenex, contribute between $3 million and $10 million, usually in
the form of goods and services.</TE>
<TE>   The Winter Games also draw strong support from companies that
simply want to run advertising during NBC broadcasts. National
advertisers are paying a reported $600,000 for 30-second commercials
during the 375.5 hours of programming that NBC, MSNBC and CNBC will
carry between Feb. 8 and Feb. 24.</TE>
<TE>   NBC, which paid $545 million for broadcasting rights, says it's on
target to hit its goal of $720 million in Olympic advertising
revenue. But industry insiders note that NBC now must deliver viewers
or face the potentially costly business of giving commercial space
later in the year to advertisers should ratings fall short.</TE>
<TE>   The Winter Games aren't as hospitable to advertisers as their
warm-weather counterparts. The luge and curling contests aren't crowd
favorites among Americans who prefer sports such as basketball and
swimming. The cold weather--and the cold economy--have trimmed back
demand for corporate hospitality events.</TE>
<TE>   But the Games are a good fit for such companies as Campbell Soup,
which is slapping the Olympic rings on every can of chicken noodle
soup it sells.</TE>
<TE>   "The Winter Games clearly is the right time of the year to be
selling chicken noodle soup," said John Faulkner, Campbell's director
of corporate and brand communications.</TE>
<TE>   The Winter Games also are a good fit for advertisers in the
process of unveiling new corporate messages. Bank of America is using
its Olympic sponsorship as an anchor for a yearlong, $60-million
advertising campaign for credit and check cards, online banking and
its home mortgage business.</TE>
<TE>   Not every sponsor wants to share the media spotlight that an
Olympic sponsorship creates. SchlumbergerSema isn't as well-known as
fellow worldwide Olympic sponsors Coca-Cola Co. and Kodak. But the
company that has replaced IBM as the International Olympic
Committee's official information technology supplier will stay behind
the scenes during the Games and broadcasts.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the wealth of corporate sponsors, the Olympic movement
can't rest on its laurels.</TE>
<TE>   "Sponsors clearly want more," said Lloyd Ward, chief executive of
the U.S. Olympic Committee. "During the 17 days of the Winter
Olympics, you see some of the greatest sponsorship riches you'll ever
see."</TE>
<TE>   What Ward envisions is the long-running opportunities that, say,
college basketball gives to sponsors during a long, regular season
that culminates in the high-profile March Madness national
championship tournament.</TE>
<TE>   "Seventeen days clearly isn't enough juice," Ward said. "The
opportunity is there to create additional venues [for sponsors] on
the road to the Beijing Games [2008] and the Athens Games [2004]."</TE>

<HD>Deloitte to Split Auditing, Consulting</HD>
<DH>Accounting: Big Five firm reverses its stance and bows to
pressure on the industry to reform practices following the collapse
of Enron.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu on Tuesday said it would separate its
consulting business from its audit practice, becoming the last of the
Big Five accounting firms to bend to pressure and decisively tackle
the Enron-tainted issue of auditor independence.</LD>
<LD>   The move is a sharp reversal from the No. 2 accounting firm's
prior stance on the issue. So far, the firm had steadfastly
maintained that it provided better service to clients by keeping its
auditing and consulting business together.</LD>
<LD>   Deloitte had clung to this position even as its other Big Five
counterparts agreed in recent days to limit the consulting services
they provide to the clients they audit as the industry came under
attack following the Enron debacle.</LD>
<TE>   "The heart of the challenge is the increasing reluctance of U.S.
clients to purchase both consulting and audit services from the same
firm," Deloitte Consulting Chief Executive Doug McCracken told staff
in a memo sent Tuesday and obtained by Reuters. He noted that the
"Enron situation has presented our firm and the accounting industry
with an unprecedented set of challenges."</TE>
<TE>   The firm "intends to separate Deloitte Consulting to enable audit
clients to continue to use the talents and skills of Deloitte
Consulting without raising public concern about auditor
independence," a Deloitte spokesman told Reuters on Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   Pressure has mounted on the accounting industry to reform its
practices following the collapse of Enron and the subsequent
revelations about the role of its auditor, Andersen, in the saga.</TE>
<TE>   "They might have concluded that given the changes in the
accounting industry, [it's] the safest thing for them to do in terms
of having outsiders view their commitment to their audit practice as
very serious," said Joseph Carcello, a professor of accounting at the
University of Tennessee. "The best thing they could do to signal that
is to do what the others have done--to divest the consulting
practice."</TE>
<TE>   Critics have renewed calls for prohibiting accounting firms from
providing their audit clients consulting services, a move regulators
had unsuccessfully pursued a couple of years ago.</TE>
<TE>   Accounting experts and other critics say earning lucrative fees
from offering consulting services and then auditing the same client
risks impairing the auditor's independence. Many also were quick to
point a finger at Andersen, which earned $27 million in non-audit
fees and $25 million in audit fees from Enron in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   In the last few days, the other four Big Five accounting firms
announced they would support proposals preventing them from providing
technology consulting and internal audit services to clients they
externally audit.</TE>
<TE>   "I think there are still a lot of people, particularly people in
the Big Five, who don't really believe that this will improve audit
quality," said Carcello. "But I think they feel that that issue is
being so focused on right now that unless they deal with that issue,
some of the other issues that may be there won't get attention."</TE>
<TE>   Deeper issues on financial reporting still remain, he said.</TE>
<TE>   The memo sent to Deloitte staff said the options to separate its
consulting arm included an initial public offering, a merger with
another firm or the creation of a separate consulting company owned
by the partners.</TE>
<TE>   Another option includes creating a strong "firewall" between
Deloitte Consulting and Deloitte &amp; Touche, the U.S. practice of
Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu, according to the memo. A time frame for the
move has not been finalized, the memo said.</TE>
<TE>   Deloitte declined to comment on how or when it will split off its
consulting arm.</TE>

<HD>EMI Group Warns of 42% Income Drop</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHUCK PHILIPS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>EMI Group shareholders blanched Tuesday when the flagging British
music giant announced its second profit warning in four months,
predicting a 42% plunge in income for its fiscal year ending March
31.</LD>
<LD>   In London, shares of EMI fell 6% Tuesday--the biggest decline
since Sept. 25, when shares plummeted 35% after EMI said its
full-year pretax profit would fall by about 20%.</LD>
<LD>   On Tuesday, EMI said its pretax profit will shrink to an estimated
$214 million--down from $372 million a year ago. EMI blamed the
shortfall on poor sales in its record division, which included duds
by Mariah Carey and Lenny Kravitz.</LD>
<TE>   Tuesday's profit warning came as EMI replaced its Chief Financial
Officer Tony Bates--the latest in a series of management oustings at
the company that releases music by such acts as Sparklehorse,
Coldplay, Janet Jackson and the Beatles.</TE>
<TE>   Bates, the architect behind EMI's Internet investment strategy,
will be replaced by company veteran Roger C. Faxon. EMI also
appointed former PolyGram executive Stuart Ellis as CFO of EMI's
Recorded Music division.</TE>
<TE>   Tuesday's downturn is the latest in a string of financial setbacks
for EMI. The British music group decided to restructure its American
operations Friday, elbowing out Virgin music executives Ray Cooper
and Ashley Newton barely a week after dumping pop star Mariah Carey.
These moves follow the November firings of Virgin head Nancy Berry
and her former husband and EMI boss, Ken Berry.</TE>

<HD>Coalition Urges FCC to Probe 'Boston Public'</HD>

<BD>A Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A coalition of watchdog groups has petitioned the Federal
Communications Commission to investigate Fox Network's high school TV
drama "Boston Public" for flouting the agency's decency regulations.
More than a dozen groups, including the Christian Coalition,
complained about shows that involved characters working as strippers
and an affair between a student and a teacher. News Corp.'s Fox unit
issued a statement saying: "'Boston Public' deals dramatically and
responsibly with real issues--often sensitive issues--that face our
children everyday in our schools."</LD>

<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Homestore.com Inc. said it named a new president for its Realtor.com
Internet site and that it plans to fire 300 workers this quarter, the
latest changes at the biggest online home-listing company since it
disclosed it had overstated revenue.</LD>
<LD>   Homestore.com named Steve Ozonian to head its main Internet site,
Realtor.com, which it manages for the National Assn. of Realtors, the
Westlake Village-based company said in an announcement.</LD>
<LD>   The company also named Pat Whelan as president of Home
Builder.com, the Web site it manages for the National Assn. of Home
Builders. Homestore.com named Walter Lowry senior vice president and
Allan Merrill executive vice president. A company spokesman didn't
return a call for comment.</LD>
<TE>   In December, Homestore.com said it would restate certain financial
reports. Two weeks later, the company said it overstated revenue in
2001 by as much as $95million and that Chairman and CEO Stuart Wolff
resigned.</TE>
<TE>   Homestore.com shares fell 23 cents to $1.18 on Nasdaq and are down
96% in the last 12 months.</TE>

<HD>Changes Proposed in ImClone Agreement</HD>
<DH>Biotech: Bristol-Myers Squibb suggests that it take control
of the FDA approval process for cancer drug Erbitux and says it wants
changes in senior management.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DENISE GELLENE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Bristol-Myers Squibb on Tuesday proposed "fundamental" changes in its
$2-billion deal with ImClone Systems, moving closer to a showdown
with the small biotechnology company.</LD>
<LD>   Bristol-Myers, in a news release, proposed that it assume control
of the regulatory approval process for Erbitux, ImClone System's
experimental cancer drug.</LD>
<LD>   The Food and Drug Administration rejected ImClone's application to
market the drug in December, leading to a massive sell-off of ImClone
shares.</LD>
<TE>   ImClone is under congressional investigation for allegedly
misleading investors about prospects for the drug. Bristol-Myers
acquired 19.9% of ImClone in October as part of a $2-billion deal to
acquire marketing rights to Erbitux. Bristol-Myers has written off
more than half of the $1.2 billion it has invested so far.</TE>
<TE>   An ImClone representative couldn't be reached for comment.</TE>
<TE>   Bristol-Myers, in its release, said it wanted other modifications
in its relationship with ImClone systems. It said it wants changes in
ImClone senior management until Erbitux receives FDA approval,
expanded rights to ImClone's intellectual property related to Erbitux
and fewer restrictions on Bristol-Myers' ability to sell its ImClone
shares.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts said that Bristol-Myers' decision to negotiate by news
release suggested that it had already presented its demands to
ImClone and had been turned down.</TE>
<TE>   "Bristol-Myers is under pressure to look good to its shareholders
and look like it is doing something," said Jim McCamant, an analyst
with Moors &amp; Cabot Dakin in Berkeley.</TE>
<TE>   The brothers who founded ImClone, Chief Executive Samuel Waksal
and Harlan Waksal, chief operating officer, aren't likely to step
aside for Bristol-Myers, McCamant said.</TE>
<TE>   "I can see them stepping aside on Erbitux, but not from the entire
company," he said. "They are not the type to back off when
threatened."</TE>
<TE>   McCamant said that Bristol-Myers' announcement, while bad news for
ImClone's management, confirmed the value of the drug, because
Bristol-Myers appears willing to fight for broader rights to it.</TE>
<TE>   Under its agreement with ImClone, Bristol-Myers agreed to pay the
company an additional $800million in two installments as Erbitux
makes its way through the FDA approval process.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts expect the drug, a treatment for colon cancer, will be
approved, but that outcome is not assured.</TE>
<TE>   Bristol-Myers stood to receive 40% of profit from Erbitux in the
United States and Canada, where it would co-market the drug with
ImClone. The company planned to market the drug in Japan with Merck
of Germany.</TE>
<TE>   Bristol-Myers had expected the FDA to grant marketing approval of
Erbitux by April and anticipated sales to reach $1.5 billion by 2005.
Analysts now say that problems with the Erbitux data that ImClone
submitted to the FDA could delay the launch of Erbitux until 2004, by
which time it is likely to face competition from similar drugs now in
development.</TE>

<HD>Investor Jitters Send Stocks Down Again</HD>
<DH>Wall St.: News that the economic stimulus bill probably
won't pass and new accounting fears erase early gains.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Stocks closed lower Tuesday, losing ground late in the day on news
that Washington's economic stimulus legislation is all but dead, and
poor profit forecasts by Sprint and other telecom firms.</LD>
<LD>   "There is too much out there that is very questionable, and the
stimulus package is gone," said Ned Collins, head of trading at Daiwa
Securities America. "It is really difficult to get someone to buy
stocks right now. People are cynical and suspicious."</LD>
<LD>   The Nasdaq composite index dropped 17.01 points, or 0.9%, to
1,838.52, while the Dow Jones industrial average dipped 1.66 points,
virtually unchanged, to 9,685.43.</LD>
<TE>   The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index shed 4.42 points, or 0.4%, to
1,090.02. Gold stocks, such as Newmont Mining, limited declines as
gold climbed to an 18-month high of $298.20 an ounce.</TE>
<TE>   Losers led winners by 3 to 2 on Nasdaq and the New York Stock
Exchange. Trading was heavy.</TE>
<TE>   Market indexes had crawled into positive territory in midafternoon
trading, but gave up gains after Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle
(D-S.D.) said he expected an economic stimulus package to fail key
procedural votes this week.</TE>
<TE>   Investors again dumped shares of conglomerate Tyco International
on jitters about its complex financial structure. Tyco was the
most-active Big Board stock for the seventh straight session and
tumbled 23%.</TE>
<TE>   A new accounting-related concern emerged when Reliant Resources,
the power-producing and trading arm of Reliant Energy, fell 13% after
saying it will restate last year's results after it mistakenly
accounted for electricity and natural gas transactions.</TE>
<TE>   The accounting crackdown likely to follow the Enron debacle is a
major issue facing Wall Street, said Morgan Stanley strategist Byron
Wien. Accountants are going to have to be tougher, and that could
have a negative effect on earnings, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "Lax accounting standards are going to be called into question,"
Wien told clients in a note. "The U.S. stock market is based on
investors' trust in accountants, analysts and corporations
themselves, and that trust is in question now."</TE>
<TE>   Investors' concern over the telecom industry's health intensified
after Sprint, the No. 3 U.S. long-distance telephone company, and its
wireless unit Sprint PCS Group reported quarterly losses and cut
their outlooks for the full year 2002. Sprint lost $2.18 to $13.83
and Sprint PCS sank $2.77 to $10.99.</TE>
<TE>   The economic news Tuesday was mixed. A key index measuring the
services sector of the economy retreated slightly in January, casting
some doubts on hopes the U.S. economy, which is mired in recession,
will swiftly rebound.</TE>
<TE>   Another report showed orders for manufactured goods rose in
December, boosted by transportation and military equipment, adding to
recent signs the worst of the recession may be past.</TE>
<TE>   "It's pointing to recovery, there's no escaping that. But the
market is caught with this Enronitis virus and ignores the economic
numbers," said Peter Cardillo of Global Partners Securities.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   In other market news:</TE>
<TE>   * The yen fell sharply Tuesday, at one point losing 1.5% against
the dollar as investors grew increasingly pessimistic on Japan's
economic and political outlook. An 18-year low for Tokyo's Nikkei 225
index combined with negative news on Japan's banking and insurance
sector from two key U.S. credit ratings agencies contributed to the
yen's tumble. The currency closed at 133.86 to the dollar.</TE>
<TE>   * Ciena lost $1.12 to $9. The optical networking firm said it
would report a wider quarterly loss than analysts had expected,
citing spending cutbacks by major customers.</TE>
<TE>   * WorldCom fell $1.16 to $6.97, an all-time low, and topped the
list of Nasdaq's most actives. The Amex telecom index fell 5.3%.</TE>
<TE>   * General Electric reassured some investors after saying its
profit would be in line with forecasts. GE rose $1.21 to $36.21 after
the company reiterated its first-quarter earnings guidance, saying
profit would be in line with Wall Street targets.</TE>

<LD>The controversial Morpheus online network, which enables people to
copy files from one another's computers free, plans a feature that
will let users sell digital music, movies and other material to one
another.</LD>
<LD>   The move by StreamCast Networks, which owns the Morpheus
technology, aims to provide more legitimate, non-copyright-infringing
uses for the network. More than two dozen movie studios and record
companies are suing Morpheus' owners for copyright infringement,
contending that the network is a haven for digital pirates.</LD>
<LD>   StreamCast Chief Executive Steve Griffin said the network's first
commerce tools should be available within four weeks.</LD>
<TE>   Those tools will enable people to wrap a digital file of any kind
in a protective layer of software that controls how the file may be
used, Griffin said. The wrappers could demand payment, or they could
require a user to view advertisements in order to play the protected
file.</TE>

<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>A Maryland jury on Tuesday found Warner-Lambert, which had supplied
the prescription diabetes drug Rezulin before being bought by drug
maker Pfizer Inc., not guilty in the death of Monica George, Pfizer
said.</LD>
<LD>   Pfizer, which bought Warner-Lambert in June 2000, said it was
pleased with the court's decision and will defend all remaining
Rezulin suits. The case was heard in the Montgomery County Circuit
Court in Rockville, Md.</LD>
<LD>   Pfizer had said Jan. 20 that it would appeal a Texas jury's
verdict in another Warner-Lambert suit. The Texas jury awarded the
plaintiffs $23.46 million in compensatory damages in the death of
Beatrice Herrera.</LD>
<TE>   Rezulin, which was used to treat Type II, or adult-onset,
diabetes, has been blamed in dozens of deaths from liver failure and
thousands of other liver damage cases from 1997 to 2000.</TE>

<BD>Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Reliant Resources Inc. delayed its fourth-quarter earnings report and
said it will restate last year's second- and third-quarter results
after mistakes the energy trader made in accounting for electricity
and natural gas transactions. The stock dropped 14%.</LD>
<LD>   Reliant also halted efforts to sell its business in Europe because
bids weren't high enough, the company said.</LD>
<LD>   Fixing the error will boost second- and third-quarter profit by
$100 million to $130 million, the company said. The company cut its
earnings forecast for this year by about 9.5% to $1.80 to $2 a share
because of the restatement and because of lower power and gas prices,
Reliant said. Reliant Energy Inc. controls the company.</LD>
<TE>   Reliant Resources shares dropped $1.87 to $11.95. Reliant Energy
fell $1.98, or 8%, to $22.94. Both trade on the NYSE.</TE>

<BD>Bloomberg News and Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Pharmacia Corp. reported sharply lower fourth-quarter profit on
rising costs and charges for the planned spin-off of its Monsanto
agricultural unit offset strong drug sales.</LD>
<LD>   Net income fell 45% to $86 million, or 6 cents a share. The
results were slammed by special items totaling 30 cents a share,
including the firm's acquisition of Monsanto Co. two years ago,
restructuring and a loss of $111 million from the spin-off planned
for the fourth quarter of 2002.</LD>
<LD>   Excluding a 2-cent-per-share profit contribution from the Monsanto
unit, which Pharmacia partially spun off last year, the drug maker
earned 36 cents a share, matching estimates.</LD>
<TE>   Sales grew 10% to $3.68 billion, as global revenue from
prescription drugs jumped 12% in the quarter to $3.22 billion.</TE>
<TE>   Pharmacia shares closed down 27 cents to $39.13 on the NYSE.</TE>
<TE>   Other earnings reports, excluding one-time items unless noted:</TE>
<TE>   * CVS Corp. said earnings in its fiscal second quarter fell 53% to
$98.2 million, or 24 cents a share, excluding hefty charges to close
unprofitable stores, as sales rose 8.4% to $6 billion. The drugstore
operator's results matched Wall Street expectations.</TE>
<TE>   * Colgate-Palmolive Co.'s said fourth-quarter profit edged up 3%
to $295.3 million, or 49 cents a share, as revenue stayed flat at
$2.41 billion.</TE>
<TE>   * Emerson Electric Co. said fiscal first-quarter net income fell
29% to $254.7 million, or 61 cents a share, as sales for
network-power equipment tumbled. Net income fell to $254.7 million,
or 61 cents a share, as sales fell 16% to $3.29 billion.</TE>
<TE>   * HCA Inc. the nation's largest for-profit hospital chain, said
fourth-quarter operating profit rose 17% to $232 million, or 44 cents
a share, two cents better than analysts' expectations, as revenue
rose 8.7% to $4.5 billion.</TE>

<BD>Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>U.S. orders for manufactured goods rose in December, but a separate
report showed growth in the vast services sector stalled in January,
painting a mixed picture for an economy still mired in recession.</LD>
<LD>   The Commerce Department said factory orders rose 1.2% in December,
lifted by transportation and military orders, after a revised 4.3%
decline in November. It was the second rise in the last three months
and was mostly in line with forecasts.</LD>
<LD>   Separately, the Institute for Supply Management, an industry trade
group, said its non-manufacturing index edged lower to 49.6 in
January from a revised 50.1 in December. That followed two straight
months of increases and bucked economists' forecasts of a rise to
52.0.</LD>
<TE>   Another report from outplacement firm Challenger, Gray &amp; Christmas
showed layoff announcements surged by 32% to 212,704 in January from
161,584 in the prior month, raising concern that a recent
stabilization in first-time unemployment claims could prove fleeting.</TE>

<BD>Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>General Mills Inc. said fiscal third-quarter and full-year profit
will miss previous forecasts because U.S. sales slowed as it joined
its sales forces with those of Pillsbury Co.</LD>
<LD>   Earnings in the quarter ending this month will be 27 cents to 29
cents a share. Sales volume will be down about 3% to 4%, the company
said.</LD>
<LD>   General Mills had forecast in December that profit before one-time
items would be 40 cents to 44 cents and that sales volume would rise
by a low-single-digit percentage. Analysts expected earnings of 42
cents a share, according to Thomson Financial/First Call.</LD>
<TE>   U.S. sales in December were disrupted as the Minneapolis-based
company integrated sales forces with those of Pillsbury, which it
bought from Diageo in October for $10.4billion. Sales improved in
January and the company expects them to increase this month.</TE>

<HD>NASA Lifts Palmdale Off Shuttle Maintenance List</HD>
<DH>Aerospace: The agency, citing cost cutting, will cease work
done there in favor of a Florida facility.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PETER PAE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The National Aeronautics and Space Administration said Tuesday that
it no longer would perform space shuttle modifications in Palmdale,
where the durable spacecraft had been assembled and maintained for
nearly three decades.</LD>
<LD>   In a blow to Palmdale's legacy as the center for the nation's most
important aerospace developments, NASA said all shuttle upgrades
would be handled at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida.</LD>
<LD>   NASA officials, who have been under congressional pressure to cut
costs, said the agency could no longer afford to maintain two
modification sites. Though major modifications to the shuttles, such
as replacing heat-resistant tiles, were done in Palmdale, the Kennedy
Space Center increasingly has been getting maintenance work in recent
years.</LD>
<TE>   Moreover, space shuttles often had to be ferried atop a modified
Boeing 747 from their landing pad in Florida to Palmdale and then
returned to the Kennedy Space Center, a costly and time-consuming
endeavor. In recent years, fewer space shuttles have had to land at
Edwards Air Force Base, adjacent to the Palmdale facility.</TE>
<TE>   A NASA review recently found that it cost the agency $30 million
more annually to perform modification work in Palmdale compared with
the Florida site.</TE>
<TE>   Though NASA determined that either site could support the current
shuttle launch schedule, "keeping two modification facilities active
to support four orbiters is no longer feasible in today's fiscal
environment," the agency said in a statement. NASA typically spends
$70 million to $100 million periodically upgrading the shuttles.</TE>
<TE>   The fate of about 300 people who work at the Palmdale site, also
known as the Space Shuttle Orbiter Major Modification facility, was
unclear, although officials with Boeing Co., which is under contract
to perform the modification work for NASA, has scheduled a meeting
with employees Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   The work force at the facility often swelled to 1,000 people when
one of the four space shuttles came to Palmdale for upgrades that
would last up to 10 months.</TE>
<TE>   NASA's move is expected to have far-reaching implications for
hundreds of Southern California subcontracting firms, many of which
are mom-and-pop operations that supply shuttle parts.</TE>
<TE>   Al Mooney, president of 12- employee Mooney Industries in Canoga
Park, said about half the company's revenue comes from work it does
for space shuttle engines.</TE>
<TE>   "It will affect us, but we don't know by how much," he said. The
company has been supplying engine parts for the shuttles since the
1970s, when the first shuttle was under development at famed Plant 42
in Palmdale.</TE>
<TE>   "It has been a good part of our business, but it is conceivable
that as soon as they find locals to do it [in Florida], they would
prefer to do it locally," Mooney said.</TE>
<TE>   Rep. Howard P. "Buck" McKeon (R-Santa Clarita), whose district
includes Palmdale, has been fighting to keep the work in California
for years but acknowledged Tuesday that with NASA's budget
constraints, his arguments faced an uphill battle. NASA has been
struggling to control an estimated $5-billion cost overrun on the
international space station.</TE>
<TE>   "This morning, I was saddened when NASA officials informed me that
they had made the determination to begin all future space shuttle
orbiter major maintenance work at Kennedy Space Center," McKeon said.
"Unfortunately, NASA is under serious budget constraints. The
international space station has forced NASA to reexamine its budget
as costs have soared and funding shrank. NASA was forced to make a
very difficult decision."</TE>

<HD>Tyco Stock, Bonds Plunge on Rating Downgrades</HD>
<DH>Conglomerates: Shares tumble 23% on concerns about the
company's credit and accounting practices.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Tyco International Ltd. stock and bonds were pummeled Tuesday amid
growing concerns about its ability to raise cash after its credit
ratings were slashed Monday.</LD>
<LD>   The stock lost as much as a quarter of its market value in early
trading on the New York Stock Exchange and, despite a mild recovery
later, saw its market value shrink by more than $13billion to about
$46 billion.</LD>
<LD>   Tyco announced after the markets closed that its financial unit
would draw from $8.5 billion in bank credits to pay off short-term
debt, a day after Tyco said it would tap $5.9 billion in credit lines
to pay off $4.5 billion in debt. The new move prompted Fitch
Investors to cut its rating on Tyco Capital's senior and subordinated
debt and to lower its commercial paper to F2 from F1.</LD>
<TE>   The parent company's debt ratings were cut Monday by Standard &amp;
Poor's and by Fitch.</TE>
<TE>   In total, the conglomerate has lost about $70 billion, or more
than half of its market value, since the beginning of the year and is
trading at its lowest level since October 1998.</TE>
<TE>   The stock closed off $6.80, or 23%, at $23.10 in heavy trading on
the New York Stock Exchange but off its intraday low of $22.50. The
shares closed at $58.90 on Dec.31.</TE>
<TE>   Tyco's 6.38% notes due in 2011 fell 5 cents to 75 cents on the
dollar Tuesday. Yield on the debt climbed 1 percentage point to
10.2%.</TE>
<TE>   Though Tyco's bonds remain investment grade, bond investors are
treating them like junk, quoting the bonds by price rather than by
their yield margin over U.S. Treasuries.</TE>
<TE>   But analysts say that no end seems in sight for the rapid decline
of Tyco's shares or bonds.</TE>
<TE>   "There's no reason to believe this name has bottomed out," said
Carol Levenson, a bond analyst at Gimme Credit, who raised questions
in a Tuesday research note about how the company would refinance an
estimated $11 billion in maturities coming due over the next 18
months.</TE>
<TE>   Concerns about Tyco's accounting practices have damaged investor
confidence after the fallout from the collapse of energy trader Enron
Corp.</TE>
<TE>   In the wake of the Enron scandal, Tyco has been haunted by rumors,
questions about its accounting and corporate ethics, and skepticism
over its plan to split into four parts. Some earlier rumors that hurt
the stock eventually proved to be untrue.</TE>
<TE>   But analysts say the company's current credit trouble represents a
real problem and the stock is likely to continue to drop until
details surface about their new financing.</TE>
<TE>   "Whether [Tyco's] life as a short seller's clay pigeon has been
the driver or whether the company's own inability to make the case
clearly enough has been the culprit, [Tyco] now is in a major league
quandary," wrote Glenn Reynolds, a bond analyst at CreditSights, in a
research note.</TE>
<TE>   Reynolds said Tyco's tapping into credit lines and its inability
to issue commercial paper demand an entirely new capital structure
for the company.</TE>

<HD>Tesoro to Buy Valero Oil Plant in California</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Tesoro Petroleum Corp., which bought refineries in Utah and North
Dakota in November, agreed to pay $1.08 billion in cash for a
California oil refinery that U.S. regulators required Valero Energy
Corp. to sell.</LD>
<LD>   The 168,000 barrel-a-day Golden Eagle plant outside San Francisco
would increase Tesoro's capacity by about 40% to almost 560,000
barrels a day, the company said. Tesoro also is gaining 70 Beacon
gasoline stations in Northern California and would own about 750
stations after the purchase.</LD>
<LD>   The acquisition would expand Tesoro's business in the state, where
refining margins have been wider than the rest of the U.S., and allow
the company to process heavier oil shipped from its plants in Alaska
and Washington. San Antonio-based Tesoro now owns 30 gas stations in
California.</LD>
<TE>   "This really fits Tesoro's strategy of building up its refining
and marketing in the western half of the U.S.," said Jacques
Rousseau, an analyst with Friedman, Billings, Ramsey &amp; Co. California
margins are typically double what they are in the rest of the
country, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Tesoro expects the purchase to add immediately to earnings. The
company is forecasting per-share earnings of $2.35 to $2.50 this year
and $3 to $3.25 next year, assuming average refining margins, Chief
Executive Bruce Smith said on a conference call with analysts and
investors.</TE>
<TE>   The company plans to sell bonds and $250 million in common shares
to fund the transaction, which is expected to close in April, Smith
said. It expects $30 million to $50 million in annual savings from
the purchase.</TE>
<TE>   Shares of San Antonio-based Valero fell 11 cents to $45.38 on the
New York Stock Exchange. Tesoro gained 84 cents to $14.87, also on
the NYSE.</TE>

<HD>Vivendi to Launch Web Video Service</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JON HEALEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Vivendi Universal plans to jump into the online video business,
launching a service that lets consumers and independent filmmakers
share their digital movies with the public.</LD>
<LD>   Steven Sheiner, chief revenue officer for Vivendi Universal Net
USA, said the new MP4.com service would launch soon, possibly within
the next 30 days. Following the footsteps of Vivendi subsidiary
MP3.com, a pioneering online music service that caters to unsigned
artists, MP4.com would provide a distribution point on the Internet
for independent video producers.</LD>
<LD>   Unlike MP3.com, however, the new site will emphasize streaming
over downloading, Sheiner said. Visitors will be able to play the
videos from the site, rather than copying them to their computers and
playing them offline.</LD>
<TE>   Vivendi, one of the world's largest media conglomerates, will
hardly be the first to enter the online video field, and several
previous efforts failed to build a Web-based business around amateur
video.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, many consumers with Webcams have gravitated toward free
sites that act as online clearinghouses for personal videos.</TE>
<TE>   Sheiner said MP4.com would let video producers post a small amount
of video on the site free but would collect fees for larger amounts.
If a producer charged viewers to see a video, MP4.com would collect a
portion of that revenue, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "Clearly there's a community out there that wants to publish and
self-publish video content," Sheiner said. With the proliferation of
digital video cameras, he predicted "a huge groundswell of
independent content" that will be looking for a distributor online.</TE>

<LD>American Express Co. has lured three prominent portfolio managers
from Fidelity Investments as it strives to perk up its struggling
mutual fund operation.</LD>
<LD>   Nick Thakore of the $12.5-billion Fidelity Fund, Robert Ewing of
the $7-billion Fidelity Balanced fund and Doug Chase of the
$673-million Fidelity Export &amp; Multinational fund are among the
Boston fund giant's top young managers, according to Morningstar Inc.
analyst Scott Cooley.</LD>
<LD>   All three funds have beaten at least 70% of their category peers
in the last 12 months, Morningstar data show.</LD>
<TE>   Thakore will take over AXP Growth and Chase will take over the
stock portion of AXP Mutual in April.</TE>
<TE>   Ewing will run AXP Large Cap Equity once that fund is launched in
the second quarter.</TE>
<TE>   Several American Express funds have been longtime laggards,
including AXP Growth, which has trailed 90% of its large-cap growth
peers over the last five years, according to Morningstar.</TE>
<TE>   Investors redeemed a net $1.6 billion from American Express
Financial's stock and bond funds last year, Financial Research Corp.

<HD>Angelides to Lobby Feds for Funds</HD>
<DH>Economy: The state treasurer is among a group seeking aid
to help states and local governments invest in infrastructure. The
plan faces long odds.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LEE ROMNEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>California Treasurer Philip Angelides will lead a delegation of
economists and other officials to Washington today to push for more
federal dollars for investments in schools, transit and other public
projects.</LD>
<LD>   The three-pronged proposal calls on the federal government to kick
in more than $150 billion to help state and local governments avoid a
fiscal meltdown and build infrastructure.</LD>
<LD>   It would do so in part through credit enhancements that would
enable the country's massive $2-trillion public pension fund system
to invest in such projects.</LD>
<TE>   The ideas were hatched last month at a meeting of state officials,
pension-fund and private-sector leaders hosted by New York
Comptroller H. Carl McCall, investment banker Felix Rohatyn and
Angelides.</TE>
<TE>   The plan is being supported by Texas economist James Galbraith and
Stephen Levy, director of the Palo Alto-based Center for Continuing
Study of the California Economy.</TE>
<TE>   Both Galbraith and Rohatyn, the former Lazard Freres banker who
helped bail out New York in the 1970s, are among those joining
Angelides in Washington today to push the cause, as is Dana Mead,
former chairman of Tenneco and the Business Roundtable.</TE>
<TE>   But the pitch to lawmakers and top labor leaders--scheduled for
today through Friday--comes at a difficult political time. The budget
unveiled by the Bush administration this week calls for severe
belt-tightening to support increases in defense and homeland
security.</TE>
<TE>   The economic stimulus package debated in Congress late last year
was too mired in partisan conflict to pass. Lobbying efforts by state
and local governments for fiscal relief have met with resistance. And
flickering signs of economic recovery will probably worsen the
group's prospects, said Peter Orszag, an economist at the centrist
Brookings Institution think tank who reviewed the proposals.</TE>
<TE>   "While it is undoubtedly well-intentioned, its political viability
is basically zero at this point," Orszag said. "We do face critical
infrastructure needs. There is a danger the recession will still turn
out to be worse than we expect. But if this had appeared five months
ago, it would likely have been much more effective in the political
sphere."</TE>
<TE>   Angelides conceded that promoting the plan will be an "uphill
battle," but said the message should be relayed to lawmakers.</TE>
<TE>   "We feel our obligation is ... to talk to policy leaders in
Washington about ... the risk that we continue to see in the
economy."</TE>
<TE>   Infrastructure investment, many agree, helps create jobs in the
short term while providing long-term economic enhancements. Franklin
Roosevelt embarked on a public works program during the Great
Depression, and Dwight Eisenhower signed the Federal-Aid Highway Act
of 1956, creating the interstate highway system.</TE>
<TE>   "Historically, it has been helpful, and it could be helpful now,"
said McCall, who was unable to join the delegation. "Unless we have
economic activity at the state level, we will not have an economic
recovery.... Helping the states toward some economic revival is
critical."</TE>
<TE>   The dialogue grew out of the Sept. 11 disaster and began with
McCall and Rohatyn. They asked Angelides to join the discussion, and
all soon realized they would fare better if the issue were tackled
nationally, Angelides said.</TE>
<TE>   State treasury and other officials from New York, Maine, North
Carolina, Oregon, Florida and Massachusetts as well as
representatives of labor unions and key public pension funds attended
meetings in December and January to hone the proposals.</TE>
<TE>   They include:</TE>
<TE>   * A call for $10 billion in federal grant funds annually for five
years, to be used in part as credit enhancements or guarantees for
state and local infrastructure projects. Those enhancements would
enable the state's public pension funds to invest in the capital
projects, including school construction and repair, light rail and
other projects. The grants could also be used for equity investments
in real estate or other development projects.</TE>
<TE>   * A call for an increase by $5 billion annually over the next
three years in the amount of tax-exempt bonds that state and local
governments can issue for private-sector community development
projects, such as affordable housing and cleanup of contaminated
development sites.</TE>
<TE>   * A call for $100-billion one-year fiscal assistance for states
and local governments to avert massive upcoming budget cuts that
probably will stall capital improvement programs for years.</TE>
<TE>   The proposal's price tag seemed unrealistic to several budget
watchers, given that states are in danger of losing billions of
dollars in transportation funding.</TE>
<TE>   "If you're coming [to Washington], I'd say you better come just to
keep what you had," said Michael Bird, federal affairs counsel for
the National Conference of State Legislatures, adding that even in
times of surplus requests for federal financing of high-speed rail
have been stymied.</TE>

<HD>Newborns Abandoned Despite Safe Haven Law</HD>
<DH></DH>

<LD>The discovery this week of a newborn boy abandoned in the parking lot
of a Canoga Park hospital has heightened concern that laws in
California and other states designed to encourage mothers to hand off
unwanted infants safely are ineffective and too little known.</LD>
<LD>   Two weeks earlier, another newborn boy was found in a Monrovia
trash bin, allegedly placed there by a teenage mother who hid her
pregnancy and has been charged with attempted murder.</LD>
<LD>   The two cases have sparked a sense of urgency that the public
should be better educated about the state's year-old safe haven law,
which allows a parent to hand over a baby at a hospital emergency
room within 72 hours of birth with no questions asked and without
fear of being prosecuted for child abandonment.</LD>
<TE>   The Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors on Tuesday requested
recommendations from health care and child welfare experts on how to
better implement the safe haven law.</TE>
<TE>   "We must better educate the public and make resources available,"
said Supervisor Don Knabe, who introduced the motion.</TE>
<TE>   "We've got to get these babies through the doors of hospitals and
into safe hands."</TE>
<TE>   Monday evening, an infant boy wrapped in a blanket was found in a
paper bag between shrubs and a lamppost about 150 feet from the
employee entrance of West Hills Hospital and Medical Center.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles Police Department detectives said they are looking for
the unknown mother but have not determined whether she or whoever
left the baby will face charges of child endangerment.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities hope to learn whether those involved knew about the
law and were trying to comply or whether the parking lot merely
presented a convenient dumping ground.</TE>
<TE>   The bag was first spotted by a nurse about 1:30 p.m. Monday. When
she returned to the hospital about 8 p.m., she heard the baby
whimpering and looked inside, said Det. Jary Quinones. The nurse
alerted police.</TE>
<TE>   Physicians at West Hills are monitoring the infant, who is in good
condition and will probably be placed in a foster home later this
week.</TE>
<TE>   Another area hospital, Pomona Valley Hospital Medical Center, has
taken a very active approach to the new law by creating a drop-off
for unwanted babies, an enclosed crib-like structure outside the
hospital near its emergency room entrance.</TE>
<TE>   However, no one has used it, to the frustration of emergency room
nurses Theresa Bouse and Lisa Grace, who came up with the idea. At
least five babies have been abandoned elsewhere in Los Angeles County
in unprotected locations since the drop-off facility was unveiled in
September.</TE>
<TE>   "I was nauseated when I heard about the Monrovia case," Grace
said. "All that mother had to do was to walk into any hospital and
walk out and her life and that of her baby would be so much
different."</TE>
<TE>   She and other proponents of the safe haven law say the difficulty
has been the getting word out and overcoming the fears of mothers
like the 16 year-old in the Monrovia case.</TE>
<TE>   Teen Mom Didn't Know About Safe Haven Law</TE>
<TE>   That teen's attorney, Joe Hopkins, said the girl did not know
about the law. He said she is a straight-A student who did not intend
to harm the child, dubbed "Baby Andrew" by nurses at Huntington
Memorial Hospital, where he was treated for skull fractures,
hypothermia and dehydration.</TE>
<TE>   The girl, Hopkins said, was impregnated by a 25-year-old man in an
encounter that amounted to rape. He said the heavyset girl hid the
pregnancy from her aunt, with whom she lived.</TE>
<TE>   "She told the detectives that she hoped someone would find it,
that she didn't want it to die and didn't know what else to do,"
Hopkins said.</TE>
<TE>   The attorney said that she had the baby in a bathroom while her
aunt was elsewhere in the house and that she then ran out when the
aunt went next door.</TE>
<TE>   "The only place she can get to and get back to her room fast
enough is the dumpster. She doesn't drop the baby in the dumpster.
She placed the baby gently in the dumpster as she wraps it in these
towels and plastic bag," Hopkins said.</TE>
<TE>   To its backers, the safe haven law is an enlightened reform that
should help such a desperate parent. It provides a 14-day period
during which the parent can reconsider and retrieve the baby. After
that, the parents' rights are terminated and the baby can be placed
for adoption.</TE>
<TE>   Although numbers are sketchy, officials estimate that 24 babies
were abandoned statewide last year, 16 in Los Angeles County, where
56 babies were reported abandoned during the last four years.</TE>
<TE>   But at a time when 35 states have adopted so-called safe delivery
laws, their effectiveness is far from certain. Critics say the laws
are poorly thought out and could encourage some mothers who might
have sought to relinquish their babies legally through adoption to
hand them over anonymously.</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, there is growing concern that the laws may skirt the
rights of fathers to contest custody and may deprive children of
vital genetic and medical history.</TE>
<TE>   The laws vary from state to state, some allowing parents to drop
babies up to 30 days old at firehouses, police stations, adoption
agencies and child care providers.</TE>
<TE>   But babies continue to be abandoned in alleys and parks by
confused teens and others. In one case, the mother was a counselor at
a women's shelter.</TE>
<TE>   "They are scared to death, scared the family will kick them out,
afraid of the shame that it can bring to themselves and their
families, or they are afraid of losing a relationship because the
boyfriend may have said get rid of the baby. But in some instances,
the girls are just very selfish, just thinking of themselves," said
Debi Faris, who created Garden of Angels, a Riverside County burial
ground where 48 abandoned babies are interred.</TE>
<TE>   In California, state officials say only four babies have been
surrendered at hospitals since the law took effect, though Faris
places the number at eight.</TE>
<TE>   Babies were turned over safely to hospitals in San Joaquin,
Nevada, Sacramento and Lassen counties.</TE>
<TE>   Many states, including California, provide no money for
publicizing the laws--a major shortcoming that has hampered
effectiveness, say proponents, such as state Senate Republican Leader
James L. Brulte (R-Rancho Cucamonga), who carried the original law
and a spending measure for a media campaign. Gov. Gray Davis last
year vetoed the $1 million funding.</TE>
<TE>   The Department of Social Services and other state agencies are
working to devise a broad-based publicity campaign. But there has
been no funding commitment.</TE>
<TE>   Supporters of safe haven laws praise New Jersey, which publicized
its law on cable television, radio, buses, billboards, newspapers and
in movie theaters. Seven babies were turned in to New Jersey
hospitals and several mothers specifically mentioned hearing or
reading about the law.</TE>
<TE>   But since the New Jersey law took effect in August 2000, five
babies have been abandoned in unsafe places, including in a park next
to a billboard advertising the safe haven law.</TE>
<TE>   "We can spend all the money we want, but if a mother is very
stressed out and thinking irrationally, we can't really control
that," conceded New Jersey Department of Human Services spokesman
Joseph Delmar.</TE>
<TE>   In Northern California, a mother placed her newborn on the
doorstep of the upscale home of a Lawrence Livermore Lab scientist
last Christmas and rang the doorbell. It is likely the mother thought
the baby would be alright, though that belief would not shield her
from prosecution for child abandonment if she is caught.</TE>
<TE>   Saving One Life Would Justify Law, Some Say</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors would have to look closely at the mother's intent and
circumstances in that and other cases in deciding whether to press
charges.</TE>
<TE>   "There is a difference between the person who leaves a baby in a
church or hospital and a person who puts a baby in a dumpster or
throws it out in the woods," said Joyce Johnson, a spokeswoman for
the Child Welfare League, a Washington, D.C.-based advocacy group.</TE>
<TE>   "For that person, these laws may not have any impact at all."</TE>
<TE>   But to proponents, the laws justify themselves if only one baby is
saved.</TE>
<TE>   "Many of these laws are like the Model T and are a long ways from
today's Ford Thunderbird," said William L. Pierce, president of the
U.S. committee of the International Assn. of Voluntary Adoption
Agencies and NGOs, a humanitarian group that aids orphans worldwide.
"They will be tweaked and fine-tuned. But in the meantime, babies
have been saved and adopted and women have avoided being jailed."</TE>
<TE>   Grace sneaked a peek at the baby boy in the Monrovia case while
visiting colleagues at Huntington Memorial. "A beautiful baby," she
said. The phones had been ringing with people wanting to adopt him.</TE>
<TE>   Grace, 39, and Bouse, 54, are planning to campaign on their own to
publicize their receiving station.</TE>
<TE>   The station, inspired by a German one, is fitted with a white,
blanket-covered bassinet inside. When the door is closed it locks and
triggers an alarm within the hospital's emergency department so staff
can respond immediately.</TE>
<TE>   It would be a wonderful world if such cases could be prevented
altogether, but that is not the reality, they said.</TE>
<TE>   "Many mothers who abandon a baby will regret it, but you can't
take back a dead baby," Grace said.</TE>

<HD>E. Blinderman, 70; Head Injury Expert</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MYRNA OLIVER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Dr. Elliott E. Blinderman, the Beverly Hills neurosurgeon who
testified for passage of California's mandatory motorcycle helmet law
a decade ago, has died. He was 70.</LD>
<LD>   Blinderman, who taught at UCLA School of Medicine and practiced at
Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, died Jan. 22 in a traffic collision
while on vacation in Naples, Fla.</LD>
<LD>   His wife, Century City attorney Barbara Blinderman, who is active
in the Sacramento-based California First Amendment Coalition, was
injured in the crash of the couple's car with a motor home that was
attempting to pass them and another automobile.</LD>
<TE>   In 1991, Dr. Blinderman offered supportive clinical testimony in
Sacramento when the previously failed motorcycle helmet law was
revived.</TE>
<TE>   Supporters were arguing that head injuries then accounted for
nearly half of motorcycle deaths.</TE>
<TE>   "They come in with blood coming out of their ears and you just
know it's another unhelmeted biker," Blinderman said as the new law
went to Gov. Pete Wilson to be approved.</TE>
<TE>   "If they live, they often are brain dead or paralyzed. Many of
these disasters would have been prevented if they'd been helmeted."</TE>
<TE>   Practicing on the Westside, Blinderman treated several famous
clients over his long career.</TE>
<TE>   Among them was Paul Kantner, Jefferson Starship lead guitarist and
a co-founder of Jefferson Airplane, who suffered a brain hemorrhage
in 1980 at the age of 39.</TE>
<TE>   Blinderman determined that Kantner had suffered no blood clot and
therefore did not require surgery, although he said at the outset
that the chances of suffering a brain hemorrhage that doesn't require
surgery were "1 in 10,000."</TE>
<TE>   Another of the neurosurgeon's well-known patients was Marques
Johnson of the Clippers, who suffered a neck injury in a collision
with teammate Benoit Benjamin in November 1986.</TE>
<TE>   Born in Brooklyn, Blinderman was educated at City College of New
York and Cornell University Medical Center where he earned the John
Metcalf Polk Award. He completed his residency at UCLA.</TE>
<TE>   The neurosurgeon taught at UCLA for 40 years, and since 1992 had
served on its Medical School Admissions Committee.</TE>
<TE>   Blinderman is survived by his wife of 42 years, Barbara; one son,
Jonathan; and two daughters, Lisa Justice and Jennifer Brady.</TE>
<TE>   The family has asked that memorial donations be made to either the
National Museum of Wildlife Art, P.O. Box 6825, Jackson Hole, WY
83002; or to the Elliott E. Blinderman Memorial Fund at Cedars-Sinai
Medical Center, 8701 W. 3rd St., No. 190, Los Angeles, CA 90048.</TE>

<LD>Police detained a man Tuesday after he allegedly set up an encampment
in the carport of teen pop star Britney Spears' home, an LAPD
spokesman said.</LD>
<LD>   Officer Jack Richter said police got a call about 11 a.m. that
Spears' private security detail was holding a man at the Hollywood
Hills house. "Ms. Spears was not at home, and the man is going to be
evaluated at a local hospital," he said. The man's identity was not
released, because officials said no arrest had been made and Spears'
security service declined to press charges. Richter said the man had
been caught at the home at least once before.</LD>

<LD>A Simi Valley man was sentenced Tuesday to 10 years in federal prison
for advertising to obtain and disseminate child porn.</LD>
<LD>   The case against Ernest Gonzales, 57, grew out of an investigation
by German national police who spotted his ad on an Internet site and
downloaded child pornography from a file server he operated.</LD>

<HD>Leader of Police Panel Steers Clear of Politics</HD>
<DH>LAPD: Rick Caruso remains calm above the fray as question
of Parks' reappointment looms.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JILL LEOVY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The mayor's discontented, Police Chief Bernard C. Parks is out of
sight and the chief's defenders are up in arms.</LD>
<LD>   But the man at the center of all the turmoil, Los Angeles Police
Commission President Rick Caruso, is annoyed.</LD>
<LD>   "I'm just annoyed by the politics on both sides of it," said the
43-year-old real estate developer. "It has no impact on me."</LD>
<TE>   Caruso serves part-time without pay as the head of the five-member
board to whom now falls the controversial question of whether to
reappoint Parks.</TE>
<TE>   That question became more complicated Tuesday after Mayor James K.
Hahn announced he does not support a second term for Parks.</TE>
<TE>   Hahn appoints the Police Commission, but under the City Charter,
the commission is also given the power to independently manage the
department, and Caruso has been especially adamant in his contention
that--no matter what the mayor says--the commission will go its own
way.</TE>
<TE>   And to that end, Caruso has remained calmly above the fray in
recent days as the mayor's intentions leaked out in the media and
African American community leaders, many of whom have strongly
supported both Parks and Hahn, reacted first with stunned
disappointment, then with anger, to what many viewed as a betrayal.</TE>
<TE>   Some observers inside and outside the Police Department question
whether the commission can truly act with independence given that the
mayor has made his preference clear. But Caruso breezily brushes off
such concerns.</TE>
<TE>   He says it won't be so easy to influence the commission as people
might think.</TE>
<TE>   And if he ends up disagreeing with the mayor?</TE>
<TE>   "What's the worst thing that can happen--that I get fired?" Caruso
allows himself a short laugh: "Then I get more personal time for my
family and my business."</TE>
<TE>   Caruso was named to the Police Commission after serving for years
on the board overseeing the Los Angeles Department of Water and
Power.</TE>
<TE>   He was born in Los Angeles, the middle son in an Italian American
family. His father built a rental car business from scratch; his
grandfather, an Italian immigrant, worked for a time as a coal miner.</TE>
<TE>   Caruso attended Catholic schools, and later what is now Harvard
Westlake, the University of California and Pepperdine Law School. He
worked in private practice for a while but found he would rather be a
client, and launched his career in real estate.</TE>
<TE>   It was a natural. Since childhood, he says, he had always loved
real estate. His first project, a shopping mall at the intersection
of La Cienega and San Vicente, made money, as did every project
after.</TE>
<TE>   His most recent project is the Grove, a large mall development
adjacent to the Farmer's Market in the Fairfax district.</TE>
<TE>   Caruso's shopping centers are distinguished by upscale design
touches--his favorite part of the job.</TE>
<TE>   He even chooses the flowers for his developments, he said.</TE>
<TE>   That same aesthetic sense has won him a reputation as a sharp
dresser, for which he is occasionally teased. "Your tan is fading,"
fellow Commissioner Rose Matsui Ochi said she chided him recently.</TE>
<TE>   Jerry Snyder, another developer, who has competed with Caruso on
projects, praised his rival as "a class act" who has been successful
in developing shopping malls because of his "incredible taste."</TE>
<TE>   Caruso and his wife, Tina, have four children, and are active in
charitable work related to children's services. Caruso is a
Republican, socially moderate and fiscally conservative, he says, but
has supported Democratic politicians such as Gov. Gray Davis.</TE>
<TE>   Assessments of his personality by those who work with him on an
off the commission are strikingly consistent. Most people mention
that he likes things to move along quickly and that he is mentally
quick and unafraid to be frank.</TE>
<TE>   "He is intelligent, quite decisive, and ... is a quick study,"
Ochi said.</TE>
<TE>   "Rick is a straight shooter, he gets to the point," said
Commissioner David Cunningham III, who has known Caruso since their
days as young lawyers.</TE>
<TE>   One frequent adversary was S. David Freeman, former head of the
DWP. Freeman said he frequently clashed with Caruso, but found him
honest--sometimes too honest.</TE>
<TE>   That's an observation that Caruso would probably not resent.</TE>
<TE>   The speculation about political influence of the Police Commission
"amazes me, because I've got no interest in the political bent of
it," he said Tuesday. Over and over, he emphasized that the
commission will make its own call.</TE>
<TE>   So far, Caruso isn't saying which way he leans. Under his
leadership, the commission has made a point of signaling that it is
not a rubber stamp for the mayor or for the City Council on various
issues. Caruso has also made it plain he is highly concerned with how
communities are affected by gang- and drug-related crime, comparing
gangs to terrorists in a recent commission meeting.</TE>
<TE>   On police reform, he said, "I would never oppose civil rights, but
my sense is that the pendulum has swung to the point that proactive
policing isn't occurring out on the streets."</TE>
<TE>   The charter leaves some ambiguity over how the process of the
chief's reappointment will play out, reserving some veto power, in
essence, for the City Council. But Caruso argues he is not ambiguous
about the commission's independence from the mayor.</TE>
<TE>   "If the mayor gave me a directive, I wouldn't accept," he said,
emphasizing that the commission works for the community, not the
mayor.</TE>
<TE>   "I am probably not going to make a lot of friends through this,"
he added.</TE>

<HD>U.S. Backs Use of CHP on Jetliners</HD>
<DH>Security: Gov. Davis' proposal to have armed officers on
airliners in the state until enough federal marshals are available
will win formal approval today.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CARL INGRAM</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>Gov. Gray Davis' plan to put armed Highway Patrol officers on
California airliners to protect against terrorists will get the
approval of the Bush administration today, it was learned Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   Under what Davis calls his "safe skies" program, plainclothes CHP
officers flying as part of their regular duties will serve as
airliner guards until an expanded force of federal sky marshals takes
over.</LD>
<LD>   Davis spokesman Steve Maviglio confirmed that Jane Garvey, chief
of the Federal Aviation Administration, had approved the plan and
informed the governor, who will announce the program today.</LD>
<TE>   Davis, who advanced the idea of CHP officers flying as undercover
security shortly after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, said he was
pleased that the Bush administration had acted promptly. He said the
officers would give the flying public an extra level of comfort.</TE>
<TE>   Sources said the only restrictions the federal government will put
on the California plan is that officers can fly only on in-state
flights and must be on official business, such as transporting
prisoners or traveling for court appearances.</TE>
<TE>   The officers must undergo specialized training in analyzing
potentially dangerous situations 30,000 feet above the Earth and
reacting appropriately, including how to use firearms in a crowded
airplane.</TE>
<TE>   CHP Commissioner D.O. "Spike" Helmick has said that the officers
could be on intrastate flights within days of finishing their
training. The plan calls for federal experts to train groups of CHP
officers who, in turn, will train other officers until the entire
6,700-member force has been taught airliner protection techniques.</TE>
<TE>   Davis administration officials, concerned that the California
economy has been hurt by a falloff in tourism since Sept. 11, believe
that the presence of armed CHP officers will encourage business
executives, vacationers and other travelers to resume their flying
habits with renewed confidence.</TE>
<TE>   "We're trying to give a greater comfort level and keep people
safe," Helmick has said.</TE>
<TE>   At first, Davis' plan met a mixed reaction. Some critics suggested
he was grandstanding in the aftermath of the terrorist attacks, but
others welcomed the idea as a common-sense innovation. Davis cornered
President Bush in Sacramento on Oct. 17 and outlined his plan. Bush
seemed interested but noncommittal. Davis took his lobbying to
Washington on Oct. 29, meeting with Garvey and Transportation
Secretary Norman Mineta. They, too, were noncommittal.</TE>
<TE>   The issue arose again Dec. 13, when the governor met with Thomas
J. Ridge, the national homeland security director. Finally, Davis
took it to Bush again on Jan. 5 when Bush made an appearance in
Ontario.</TE>
<TE>   Maviglio said Bush expressed concern that no action had been taken
one way or the other. Maviglio said Bush told Davis that he deserved
an answer quickly and indicated he would make it happen.</TE>

<HD>Bridging the Artistic Gap for Students and Teachers</HD>
<DH>UC program offers art lessons for kids, training for
collegians and tips for classroom veterans.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ANDREA PERERA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The art lesson in a fifth-grade class at West Los Angeles' Shenandoah
Street Elementary School is about how to define visual space.</LD>
<LD>   Instructor Rebecca Campbell steps in front of a light projector,
casting her shadow on the wall. She tells the students that her
shadow constitutes positive space; the empty area around her image,
negative space. Campbell asks Josue Flores, 10, to find the positive
space again. As he innocently touches his teacher's projection, the
pre-puberty class squeals in unison.</LD>
<LD>   "Ewww!"</LD>
<TE>   As raucous as the class may be at times, Campbell seems
unconcerned. A little noise means her students are actually paying
attention, said Campbell, who recently received a master's degree in
fine arts from UCLA.</TE>
<TE>   She also believes that this class, part of a University of
California program known as ArtsBridge, offers a valuable experience
for teachers as well as students.</TE>
<TE>   The program is meant to provide a bridge spanning three
generations.</TE>
<TE>   ArtsBridge awards UC undergraduate and graduate students
$1,000-a-quarter scholarships to gain real-life teaching skills in
K-12 classrooms. At the same time, veteran teachers learn about the
arts from them. And the youngsters benefit from exposure to theater,
dance, photography, music and painting--subjects that educators say
are too often lacking, especially in urban schools.</TE>
<TE>   Through the arts, children gain confidence, sharpen motor skills
and build critical thinking, said Patty Wickman, director of the UCLA
ArtsBridge program for the School of the Arts and Architecture since
1999.</TE>
<TE>   But most important, Campbell said, children learn that art, by
itself, is important.</TE>
<TE>   "It does teach you hand-eye coordination and concentration," she
said. "But it's so much better than that. You can't even put it into
words."</TE>
<TE>   Teachers and ArtsBridge scholars, as the college students are
called, say they learn their own valuable lessons as well by sharing
skills and training.</TE>
<TE>   For example, Campbell says she has picked up tips on how to gear
lessons to fifth-graders from Marianne Boroditsky, whose Shenandoah
classroom she takes over for an hour twice a week.</TE>
<TE>   "I might have an idea, but she's able to bring to it how to get
the idea across," Campbell said.</TE>
<TE>   Founded in 1996 at UC Irvine, ArtsBridge started up as a response
to arts cutbacks at public schools. In the last academic year, 780
scholars operated out of eight UC schools and California State
University's Long Beach and Sacramento campuses.</TE>
<TE>   ArtsBridge has a statewide annual budget of $1.5 million, although
its supporters are alarmed by Gov. Gray Davis' proposal to cut that
in half for next year under general austerity measures.</TE>
<TE>   UCLA operates two ArtsBridge programs, one in the School of the
Arts and Architecture and one in the School of Theater, Film and
Television.</TE>
<TE>   Campbell participates through Arts and Architecture, where
typically 100 scholars teach sessions that last an academic quarter
to 2,800 Los Angeles school district children on such topics as
ballet, jazz, African dance and painting. Some students visit art
exhibits at the UCLA Hammer Museum and others learn photography
concepts.</TE>
<TE>   A painter, Campbell has been involved with ArtsBridge since she
began her graduate studies two years ago. She has been at Shenandoah
since October and, because she has finished her degree, is considered
a scholar emeritus with a continuing stipend.</TE>
<TE>   Campbell designs the arts curriculum for the class. Boroditsky
reviews the lesson plans, deciding which are appropriate for her
students, mostly English language-learning Latinos. Then Campbell
teaches, with Boroditsky adding suggestions and helping to maintain
discipline.</TE>
<TE>   Boroditsky, who counts artists among her family and friends, said
she learns new art concepts each time Campbell takes over.</TE>
<TE>   "In my mind, art is more important than many other subjects,"
Boroditsky said. "Art completes a full education."</TE>
<TE>   After defining negative space as empty space in an artwork and
positive space as the area filled with lines, designs, colors and
shapes, Campbell asks her students to demonstrate the ideas
themselves.</TE>
<TE>   She hands them 6-foot-long swatches of brown butcher paper and
tells the students to pair off and trace each other's bodies onto the
paper.</TE>
<TE>   Inside their traces lies the positive space. Outside is the
negative space they will cut away.</TE>
<TE>   Leslie Estrada and Vilmida Castro, both 10, partner up. Leslie
says she likes Campbell's art lessons because she gets to do things
frowned upon in her other classes.</TE>
<TE>   "We can do grown stuff," Leslie said. "Charting stuff, coloring
the way you want to, painting and drawing."</TE>
<TE>   About her other classes that require students to sit and learn
from books, she says: "We do too much of that."</TE>
<TE>   Until recently, arts classes were some of the first items to hit
the chopping block in budget-strained school districts like Los
Angeles'. Twenty years of such cuts seemed headed for a turnaround in
1999, however, when the Los Angeles district created a new program
that shuttled arts teachers to schools on a rotating basis.</TE>
<TE>   But that has limits. At Shenandoah, only eight of 43 K-5 classes
benefit, school officials say. Volunteers and such university-based
arts groups as ArtsBridge try to fill in the gaps.</TE>
<TE>   But now the UC program, which has inspired pilot programs at New
York University, the University of Utah and the University of
Colorado, faces potentially devastating cutbacks, according to Jill
Beck, dean of the arts at UC Irvine and director of ArtsBridge.</TE>
<TE>   "We know ArtsBridge is good. We just need to try to maintain it,"
Beck said.</TE>
<TE>   She hopes the state Legislature will reject Davis' proposed cuts,
and she also will meet with federal officials to seek funding.</TE>
<TE>   In the meantime, ArtsBridge scholars will continue providing
children with arts classes that offer a lens through which they can
view the world in a new way, Campbell said.</TE>
<TE>   "There are a million lessons you can learn," she said.</TE>

<HD>Sigvard Bernadotte, 94; Former Swedish Prince</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Count Sigvard Bernadotte, a former Swedish prince who lost his royal
title in 1934 after marrying a commoner then sued recently to get it
back, has died. He was 94.</LD>
<LD>   Bernadotte, who was also a noted industrial designer, died Monday
in Stockholm, according to the royal court, which did not announce
the cause of death.</LD>
<LD>   The Bernadotte dynasty has ruled since 1818 in the Scandinavian
country of nearly 9 million people.</LD>
<TE>   Sigvard Bernadotte was the second son of King Gustaf VI Adolf, who
reigned from 1950 to 1973, and an uncle of the present King Carl XVI
Gustaf.</TE>
<TE>   But Bernadotte's title and place in the royal succession were
removed in 1934 after he married German commoner Erika Patzek.</TE>
<TE>   After his removal from the line of succession, Bernadotte and his
wife lived for a time in Southern California. A gifted artist,
Bernadotte made his living as a silversmith.</TE>
<TE>   Bernadotte, who initially accepted his removal from the royal
line, sued Sweden, a constitutional monarchy, in the European Court
last May to regain his title. The lawsuit was still pending at his
death.</TE>
<TE>   "I was born a prince, and I want to die a prince," Bernadotte said
when he filed the suit, saying his human rights were violated when
his right to his title was denied.</TE>
<TE>   In 1951, he was dubbed Count of Wisborg by Grand Duchess Charlotte
of Luxembourg.</TE>
<TE>   Bernadotte divorced Patzek in 1943 and married Sonja Helene
Robbert the same year. He divorced Robbert in 1961, marrying his last
wife, Marianne Lindberg, later that year.</TE>
<TE>   For many years, Bernadotte felt wronged and refused to participate
in celebrations of the royal family, but he enjoyed warmer relations
with the family in recent years.</TE>
<TE>   Bernadotte attended the funeral of his brother, Prince Bertil, in
January 1997 at the invitation of the king, and was at the royal
couple's 25th wedding anniversary last summer.</TE>
<TE>   The flags flew at half staff at the royal palace in Stockholm, and
the royal family canceled part of its program this week in mourning,
court spokeswoman Elisabeth Tarras-Wahlberg said.</TE>
<TE>   The royal family is expected to attend the funeral,
Tarras-Wahlberg said, but no date for it has been set.</TE>
<TE>   Bernadotte is survived by his wife and a son from his second
marriage, Michael.</TE>

<HD>3 Children Die in House Fire Despite Intense Rescue Effort</HD>
<DH>Tragedy: Blaze erupts in front bedroom of Pico-Union house.
Neighbors, firefighters are stymied by flames.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KENNETH REICH and SANDRA MURILLO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Fire erupted in the front bedroom of a crowded Victorian house in the
Pico-Union district Tuesday morning and, despite the frenzied efforts
of neighbors and firefighters, three small children died.</LD>
<LD>   A fire prevention captain working with CBS movie makers a block
away rushed to the scene, and 10 fire companies quickly followed,
Fire Department spokesman Steve Ruda said. But the room was enveloped
in flames, preventing anyone from reaching the children.</LD>
<LD>   The fire began about 8:30 a.m. at a house in the 1400 block of
Alvarado Terrace. Officials identified the dead as Juan and Karla
Santoyo, ages 5 and 4, and half-brother Christian Calzada, 2.</LD>
<TE>   The children's mother, Aracely Calzada; Christian's father, Raul
Calzada; and a grandmother were treated at a hospital for smoke
inhalation and released.</TE>
<TE>   Ruda said the adults were in the back of the house when the fire
erupted, possibly set off by a space heater, and were unable to save
the children.</TE>
<TE>   "When the firemen arrived, neighbors were using garden hoses and
throwing buckets of water in an attempt to extinguish the flames, but
they were just too much," Ruda said.</TE>
<TE>   He said investigators had already discovered that several families
were living in the nine-room, two-story house.</TE>
<TE>   Ruda called the neighborhood "one of the most densely populated in
the city."</TE>
<TE>   Building owner Corey Angel could not be reached for comment. A
spokesman for the Los Angeles Building and Safety Department said the
only recent citation on record for the building was in August, for an
illegally built carport that has since been demolished.</TE>
<TE>   Ruda said the city fire and police departments would investigate
the blaze.</TE>
<TE>   Neighbors and an adopted member of the Calzada family described
the heart-rending scene of the children losing their lives in the
blaze.</TE>
<TE>   Rita Suarez said she heard commotion outside her door and called
911 after the fire began.</TE>
<TE>   "I went out to my balcony because I heard these awful screams,"
she said.</TE>
<TE>   Suarez said neighbors and family members were calling out for
help, begging anyone to get the children out.</TE>
<TE>   "Never in my life had I witnessed something so horrible," she
said.</TE>
<TE>   Jose Raul, who was in the neighborhood looking for work when he
came upon the scene and was asked to help, related how he and several
others ran to the back of the house and tried to put out the fire
with a neighbor's garden hose.</TE>
<TE>   "We did everything we could, but it wasn't enough," Raul said.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Francisca Contreras, a relative of the Calzadas, said
of the mother, "That young woman is just devastated. We all just
can't believe how terrible this is."</TE>
<TE>   Ruda said that once the fire department arrived on the scene, it
took 25 minutes to fully extinguish the flames, which burned one room
and reached the attic but did not destroy the building.</TE>

<HD>Doctor in Fraud Trial Dies in Fall From Hotel</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MONTE MORIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A Beverly Hills physician and federal defendant in a $3-million
bankruptcy fraud case apparently jumped to his death Tuesday morning,
prompting a federal judge to sequester jurors to prevent their
learning of his death during deliberations, police said.</LD>
<LD>   John Bussell, 55, an anesthesiologist, was seen falling from the
10th floor of the Embassy Suites hotel in Santa Ana at 6:22 a.m.,
just hours before jurors were to assemble for the their third day of
deliberations, Santa Ana Police Sgt. Baltazar De La Riva said.</LD>
<LD>   Bussell, along with his co-defendant and physician wife, Letantia,
53, had been staying at the hotel since early November, when
testimony began in U.S. District Court in Santa Ana.</LD>
<TE>   Jurors, who were quickly sequestered at the close of deliberations
Tuesday, have not been told of Bussell's death.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. District Judge Alicemarie H. Stotler decided that news of his
death and its circumstances could prejudice their view of Letantia
Bussell, and that sequestering them would, hopefully, prevent them
from learning of the incident during deliberations.</TE>
<TE>   Jurors, however, were told to consider Letantia Bussell's guilt or
innocence only and not her husband's.</TE>
<TE>   Before Tuesday night, jurors had not been sequestered.</TE>
<TE>   "It's very unusual to have a sequestered jury in this district,
but certainly some unusual circumstances have entered into this
case," said Thom Mrozek, a spokesman for the U.S. attorney's office.</TE>
<TE>   Officials declined to say where jurors were being housed.</TE>
<TE>   Santa Ana police say Bussell's fall was witnessed by a passing
motorist, and that paramedics discovered the body on a fourth-floor
balcony. A department spokesman said investigators were treating the
death as a probable suicide and that Bussell had grown despondent
over his legal battle. In May 2000, a federal grand jury indicted the
Bussells and their attorney-accountant of scheming to hide
substantial assets from a federal Bankruptcy Court and creditors by
creating three corporations.</TE>
<TE>   The government also charged that the couple cheated federal and
state tax collectors of more than $1.1 million.</TE>

<HD>Assembly Candidate's Residency in Dispute</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GEORGE RAMOS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The fight between two rivals to succeed Democrat Gil Cedillo as
representative of the state's 46th Assembly District heated up
Tuesday when supporters of one candidate accused the other of not
living in the district.</LD>
<LD>   The accusation came at a news conference at an aging apartment
building near MacArthur Park, which Assembly candidate Fabian Nunez
lists as his official residence. Maria Del Angel, who opposes Nunez,
alleged that he actually lives in Claremont-- far from the 46th
District, which covers parts of Los Angeles' downtown and Eastside.</LD>
<LD>   Del Angel and other residents displayed photographs taken from a
videotape last week that purported to show Nunez, 35, at the
Claremont home of his ex-wife and three children.</LD>
<TE>   "He is lying to us and we are asking him to withdraw" from the
race, Del Angel said. "How can he care about our community when he
doesn't live here?"</TE>
<TE>   Reached afterward, Nunez called the accusations "nothing more than
a publicity stunt."</TE>
<TE>   "I'm divorced," he said, noting that his children live with their
mother in the town at the eastern edge of Los Angeles County. "I have
a right to be with my children. There's nothing wrong about driving
my kids to school. Pedro Carrillo wouldn't be making these charges if
he was a divorced father," he said, referring to his chief opponent
in the March 5 primary.</TE>
<TE>   While Del Angel and others at the news conference said they were
not supporters of Carrillo, they acknowledged that the allegations
initially went to Carrillo, whose attorney, Otto Pena, hired
investigators to make the videotape.</TE>
<TE>   Nunez served three years as the Los Angeles County Federation of
Labor's political director and was head of governmental affairs for
the Los Angeles Unified School District when he declared his
candidacy. Carrillo is a senior chief deputy to Rep. Lucille
Roybal-Allard (D-Los Angeles). Maywood City Councilman Tomas Martin
is the third candidate in the race.</TE>

<HD>More Water Studies Ordered for Ojai Valley Golf Course</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CATHERINE SAILLANT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Developers of a proposed Ojai Valley golf course must conduct
additional water studies before the Ventura County Board of
Supervisors will consider approving the project.</LD>
<LD>   The board ordered the studies Tuesday after Supervisor John Flynn
of Oxnard changed his mind on the water issue.</LD>
<LD>   Flynn last week dismissed concerns that proposed changes to the
200-acre project necessitated further analysis of whether there would
be enough water. But on Tuesday, he switched his vote, completing the
majority needed to require the water study.</LD>
<TE>   Supervisors Steve Bennett and Kathy Long also voted to include
water in a supplemental environmental analysis.</TE>
<TE>   The Board of Supervisors approved Farmont Golf Course in 1993. But
the project was delayed for nearly a decade by lawsuits filed by an
environmental group.</TE>
<TE>   Although, originally pitched as a private course offering no more
than 35 rounds a day, New York developer Intell Management now wants
a public course offering 130 rounds.</TE>
<TE>   After the meeting, Flynn said officials from Ojai, Ventura and the
Casitas Municipal Water District had contacted him when they learned
the vote would be reconsidered. The supervisor said he changed his
vote because no studies have been done on how much surface water and
ground water would be drawn from the Ventura River for the golf
course.</TE>
<TE>   An Intell spokesman, who said he opposes further water analysis,
was unsure whether the project would proceed.</TE>
<TE>   "That is something my client will have to decide," lawyer Lindsay
F. Nielson said.</TE>

<HD>Riverside Man Gets 2 Years in Internet Fraud</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It was an Internet fraud scheme that in just seven months cost
telephone and Internet service providers throughout the country more
than $9 million, prosecutors say.</LD>
<LD>   But Monday a judge ordered a Riverside businessman to pay it all
back. Gregory D. Evans, 33, will also serve two years in federal
prison on charges of federal conspiracy and wire fraud.</LD>
<LD>   "This was a very serious case," said Assistant U.S. Atty. Angela
Davis, "not only because it defrauded huge, powerful interstate
communication carriers, but it also defrauded mom-and-pop Internet
service companies."</LD>
<TE>   From November 1996 to June 1997, Evans ran a company called
Connect America, which specialized in selling toll-free numbers for a
flat rate. But authorities said the numbers actually belonged to AT&amp;T
or MCI.</TE>
<TE>   Evans opened more than 125 toll-free lines through the phone
companies, setting up the accounts with false names and billing
addresses. He then charged his own customers about $2,500 for access
to the lines, but never paid AT&amp;T or MCI. When the phone companies
tried to mail out bills for the lines, the envelopes came back marked
"return to sender."</TE>
<TE>   As the lines would shut down for nonpayment, Evans would set up
new accounts, again using false names and addresses.</TE>
<TE>   "He found a glitch in the system and took advantage of it," Davis
said. "It used to be very easy to set up an 800 number. You just gave
a name and address and nobody verified that information. I don't
think that glitch exists anymore."</TE>
<TE>   Evans pleaded guilty to the fraud and conspiracy charges in 1998.
Davis said the long gap between a guilty plea and sentencing is not
unusual.</TE>

<HD>Ex-Firefighter Gets 2 1/2 Years in Burning of Wife's
Carport</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD WINTON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A former Los Angeles firefighter who was captured after 2 1/2 years
on the run was sentenced Tuesday to two years in prison for setting
fire to the carport of his estranged wife's South Pasadena apartment.</LD>
<LD>   David Walter Pierson, 67, sat passively as Pasadena Superior Court
Judge Judson W. Morris Jr. sentenced him to state prison and ordered
him to pay $200 to a victims fund. Before the sentencing, his lawyer
said Pierson also paid $4,000 in restitution to the victim.</LD>
<LD>   "I've seen guys down further than this and come back and live
productive lives," Morris told Pierson.</LD>
<TE>   Last month, Pierson pleaded no contest to arson. In exchange,
prosecutors dropped related charges that could have led to a sentence
of 10 years in prison.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm happy the case was so easily resolved after a lengthy
investigation. The defendant seemed perfectly ready to accept
responsibility for his actions," Deputy Dist. Atty. Philip Wojdak
said. "We were also able to collect some restitution for the victim."</TE>
<TE>   The couple got married Feb. 14, 1999. Shortly after, investigators
allege, Pierson beat his wife. Pauline Pierson--now Pauline
Hohmann--sought a temporary restraining order against her husband
March 9, 1999, citing domestic violence.</TE>
<TE>   That month, a court commissioner granted the order forbidding
Pierson to come within 100 yards of her, forcing him to move out of
their apartment. Within days, Hohmann's car tires had been slashed
and her carport set ablaze, and Pierson had fled the state.</TE>
<TE>   Robert Jones, a South Pasadena fire investigator, said Pierson
used a flammable liquid to ignite the fire that destroyed his wife's
car and two other vehicles, and burned an adjoining structure and a
utility pole in the 1800 block of Fremont Avenue.</TE>
<TE>   The retired firefighter admitted the arson after being captured at
a Laughlin, Nev., post office Sept. 18, police said.</TE>

<HD>Drunk Driver Involved in Fatal Crash Gets 5 Years</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CAROL CHAMBERS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A drunk driver who killed a 19-year-old baseball star last year in a
head-on crash in Santa Clarita was sentenced Tuesday to five years in
state prison.</LD>
<LD>   Michael Charles Glover, 45, of Saugus pleaded guilty Dec. 7 to
charges of gross vehicular manslaughter and driving under the
influence of alcohol in the death of Nolan LeMar, a co-captain of the
College of the Canyons baseball team who hoped to play professionally
one day.</LD>
<LD>   LeMar died at the scene of the April 9 crash on Soledad Canyon
Road after Glover's pickup crossed the median and slammed into
LeMar's oncoming sport utility vehicle.</LD>
<TE>   LeMar was one of two students injured in a November 1998 science
class explosion at William S. Hart High School in Newhall, suffering
second-degree burns over 12% of his body. He battled hard to recover
so he could play baseball again, his coaches said after the crash,
and helped Hart win the 1999 Southern Section Division II
championship.</TE>
<TE>   Tuesday's emotional hearing was attended by more than a dozen
friends and family members of both Glover and LeMar, among them
LeMar's father Dean, whose written statement was read in court: "He
took my precious son, my best friend and my dreams for him. Life will
never be the same."</TE>
<TE>   Glover, a cabinetmaker, apologized to the LeMar family and to his
own, saying he was sorry for the pain he had caused.</TE>
<TE>   Glover, who had been free on $100,000 bail, was taken into custody
immediately after the sentencing hearing in San Fernando Superior
Court. He must serve at least 85% of the prison term, Deputy Dist.
Atty. Lori Dery said.</TE>

<LD>The Los Angeles Housing Department overspent the budget for its
apartment inspection program by $250,000 last year, according to City
Controller Laura Chick, who called Tuesday for reforms to avoid
future red ink.</LD>
<LD>   Chick proposed better internal controls to identify potential
deficits earlier, as well as improved communications with city budget
planners.</LD>
<LD>   "In this case, the department didn't want to reduce service levels
for an important program," Chick said. "I can appreciate that, but
running the program into the red is no solution either."</LD>

<HD>Jean Patchett, 75; Fashion Model for Ford Made 40 Magazine
Covers</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BOOTH MOORE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Jean Patchett, one of the most photographed fashion models of the
1950s, has died. She was 75.</LD>
<LD>   Patchett died Jan. 22 of emphysema at her home in La Quinta.</LD>
<LD>   It is often said that Patchett made a mountain out of a mole to
the left of her lips, which became her trademark years before Cindy
Crawford was born.</LD>
<TE>   Patchett collaborated with photographers Louise Dahl-Wolfe, John
Rawlings and Erwin Blumenfeld, but was most closely associated with
Irving Penn. His 1949 shot of Patchett sitting at a cafe, chewing on
a strand of pearls, was one of their most famous photographs.</TE>
<TE>   "We really made history," Patchett said in Michael Gross' "Model:
The Ugly Business of Beautiful Women" (William Morrow, 1995) of her
work with Penn. "To have five pictures of yourself hanging in the
Museum of Modern Art! I didn't know that I was going to be doing
that."</TE>
<TE>   She worked in the same glamorous era as cover girls Dorian Leigh,
Suzy Parker and Lisa Fonssagrives, Penn's wife. Patchett was the
first star model for New York's Ford Models, a new agency when
Patchett walked in the door in the spring of 1948.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't remember everyone, but I do remember her," Eileen Ford
said Monday. "You just had to take a deep breath, even then. She had
on a black coat with black velvet at the shoulders and a black velvet
beret--all made by her mother--and garnet earrings, bracelet and
necklace. She really was a country girl."</TE>
<TE>   Patchett was born in Preston, Md., a small town on the Eastern
Shore. After unhappy stints in secretarial school and in college, she
set her sights on a modeling career in New York. She signed with
Harry Conover's agency and moved into a Methodist rooming home for
women for $13.50 a week, she told Gross.</TE>
<TE>   After a few months, she left Conover for Ford. By September 1948,
she had her first of more than 40 covers.</TE>
<TE>   Patchett earned $50,000 a year at the peak of her career.</TE>
<TE>   "I think Irving Penn said it best: 'She was an American goddess in
French couture,'" Ford said.</TE>
<TE>   Patchett was a regular at the legendary Stork Club. "None of us
had any money, but we managed to look the part," Ford said. "God
bless Loehmann's. We'd go clear out to Brooklyn to shop there."</TE>
<TE>   Patchett met Louis Auer, a banker, at a luncheonette in 1949. "We
met through a pair of twins I had known for a few years who were
modeling in New York and living at the Barbizon," he said Monday.</TE>
<TE>   "They called and said, there's a cute gal that just came into the
place." Soon after, Auer gave her the nickname Pancho. "Patchett,
Patcho, Pancho ... that's how it evolved," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The two were married in 1951.</TE>
<TE>   "She was not one of those people who assumed she was pretty and
entitled," he said. "She worked hard and was always prompt."</TE>
<TE>   Patchett retired from modeling in the early 1960s to take care of
her two children. In the early 1980s, she and her husband moved to La
Quinta.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to Auer, she is survived by daughter Amy Auer of
Westhampton Beach, N.Y.; sister J. Fred King and brother Frank
Patchett.</TE>

<DH>Landmark: Many in Downey want to preserve Johnie's Broiler,
which has served generations of teenagers and now is an auto
dealership.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BOB POOL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>People in Downey these days are wondering just what's cooking at
Johnie's Broiler.</LD>
<LD>   For 44 years, the drive-in restaurant with its soaring neon
rooftop sign and its mid-century glass-and-stone Googie architecture
has been a local landmark.</LD>
<LD>   Generations of teenagers have been raised on burgers and shakes
beneath the long overhangs that extend like airplane wings from the
sides. Car club members from across Los Angeles County have pulled in
to see and be seen in hot rods.</LD>
<TE>   No wonder locals were surprised last month when they noticed old
cars being parked long-term outside the Firestone Boulevard diner.
The place was becoming a real used-car lot.</TE>
<TE>   Downey is a place where the drive-in restaurant is revered. It is
the home of the oldest McDonald's, not to mention the world's first
Taco Bell building.</TE>
<TE>   But a handwritten sign taped to Johnie's front door explained that
the diner was closed. A banner hanging on a nearby window announced
that Car Outlet Inc. was open.</TE>
<TE>   Inside the 110-seat dining area, things looked the same. Beyond
the chrome-plated restaurant cash register--past the rock wall
decorated with a framed photograph of the 1989 Downey High School
marching band--pots and pans still hung from hooks over grills
blackened by a million sizzling sirloins and patty melts.</TE>
<TE>   But across from a counter worn smooth by just as many elbows, car
sales contracts were piled on Formica-topped tables.</TE>
<TE>   Sixteen-year-old Teresa Perez was among those horrified when word
circulated that Johnie's might be torn down to make way for a car
showroom. She set out on a campaign to save it.</TE>
<TE>   "This place is a part of Downey history," she said. "Think about
it. If they tear down Johnie's, then Downey will be even more boring
than it already is."</TE>
<TE>   Teresa reminded others in town that over the years Johnie's has
dished up more than just food. It has been the backdrop for numerous
movies, TV shows and music videos. The famous fight scene between Ike
and Tina Turner in 1993's "What's Love Got to Do With It?" was filmed
there. So were parts of 1994's "Reality Bites," starring Winona Ryder
and Ethan Hawke.</TE>
<TE>   "It is because of its authenticity that it appeals to Hollywood.
It is because of Johnie's that Downey appeals to Hollywood," she
said. Teresa's campaign soon had classmates at Warren High School
buzzing about it. So was City Hall.</TE>
<TE>   City officials, it turns out, were as much in the dark about
Johnie's future as everyone else.</TE>
<TE>   In 1993, officials helped preserve the world's oldest
McDonald's--with genuine golden arches and the original 1953
"Speedee" winking mascot.</TE>
<TE>   City leaders brag that the premier Taco Bell drive-in survives on
Firestone, a few blocks west of Johnie's. Its original faux
Mission-style look is still visible, although the seafood tacos it
now sells do not carry the Taco Bell name.</TE>
<TE>   Teresa invoked the memory of the successful McDonald's
preservation fight, recalling how former Downey Mayor Joyce Lawrence
wrote the "McCorporate Moguls" at hamburger headquarters:</TE>
<TE>   We deserve a break today--</TE>
<TE>   Do not take our youth away!</TE>
<TE>   Here we met for shakes and fries--</TE>
<TE>   While Downey grew 'neath sunny skies.</TE>
<TE>   It would be poetic justice if current city leaders once again rose
to the defense of Downey's drive-ins, Teresa said.</TE>
<TE>   Mayor Meredith Perkins responded by asking City Manager Gerald
Caton to find out what was happening at Johnie's. Records found by
his office indicated that the restaurant isn't zoned for a car lot.</TE>
<TE>   Downey Police Lt. Rick Esteves, whose office handles code
enforcement for the city, said he suspects that Johnie's owner and
its new leaseholder were "looking at dual usage," a combination
drive-in and car-sales lot.</TE>
<TE>   Property owner Christos John Smyrniotis conceded that the fate of
the restaurant is "the million-dollar question."</TE>
<TE>   He has owned Johnie's since 1966. The Greek-born restaurateur was
operating a place in Long Beach that year when he passed through
Downey and noticed the glass-and-stone building. It was called
Harvey's Broiler. "I went in and met the owner, Harvey Ortner, and he
told me he was interested in retiring. I struck a deal on the spot,"
Smyrniotis said. He renamed the diner to reflect his own middle name.</TE>
<TE>   Smyrniotis said the used-car people approached him the same way.
"Those guys were coming around for a month or so. Finally I said,
'I'm ready to retire.'"</TE>
<TE>   The 10-year lease calls for Johnie's to be operated as either a
restaurant or as a car lot, Smyrniotis said. He will evaluate the lot
operators' plans when they are submitted to him.</TE>
<TE>   Car Outlet General Manager Jay Walia said the landmark building
might be incorporated into an auto showroom. But, he said, "We're in
the used-car business, not the restaurant business."</TE>
<TE>   Preservationists still have hope.</TE>
<TE>   Although Downey lacks a historic preservation ordinance, dozens of
Johnie's fans have appealed for help from the Los Angeles
Conservancy. Leaders of that group said they plan to meet with
various Downey factions to look for a compromise.</TE>
<TE>   "Just judging from the volume of calls we've received since it
closed, there's truly a reservoir of support from residents of Downey
for it," said Ken Bernstein, director of preservation issues for the
conservancy. "We're studying what our best approach may be to see
Johnie's used in an economically productive way."</TE>
<TE>   That may be a tall order at Downey's favorite short-order grill.</TE>

<DH>Klamath: Acivists ask the Bush administration to ignore a
critical report and not to favor farmers over salmon.</DH>

<LD>A coalition of environmental groups Tuesday called on the Bush
administration to ignore a critical scientific report and maintain
water levels for endangered salmon and sucker fish in the Klamath
Basin.</LD>
<LD>   Meanwhile, a public interest law firm sued in U.S. District Court
in Eugene, Ore., to yank the Klamath coho salmon off the endangered
species list.</LD>
<LD>   Those moves came as federal regulators grapple with how to divide
water between fish and farmers, who suffered during last summer's
drought. A federal decision on this summer's water allocations in the
Klamath Basin, which straddles the Oregon-California border, is
expected by early April.</LD>
<TE>   Shadowing that decision is a new report by the National Academy of
Sciences, which concludes that federal resource agencies lacked
sufficient scientific proof to warrant sluicing irrigation water to
about 1,200 farmers and more than 200,000 acres in the basin.</TE>
<TE>   In a joint statement, a collection of eight groups--including
Defenders of Wildlife, the Sierra Club and the Pacific Coast
Federation of Fishermen's Assns.--called on the administration to
take a "precautionary approach" and maintain high water levels in
Upper Klamath Lake and the Klamath River.</TE>
<TE>   An Interior spokesman said it would be premature to comment, given
the looming water allotment decision.</TE>
<TE>   "What the department is committed to is accurate and reliable
science that everyone can have confidence in, as much confidence as
possible," said Mark Pfeifle, a spokesman for Interior Secretary Gale
Norton.</TE>
<TE>   Biologists have argued that high water in the lake helps curb
oxygen depletion, which threatens two species of endangered sucker
fish. Higher flows on the Klamath River, they argued, would improve
water quality for threatened coho salmon.</TE>
<TE>   The National Academy report countered that insufficient science
exists to support those contentions, a stance that environmentalists
say conflicts with the government's legal responsibility to rush help
to endangered species using the best available science.</TE>
<TE>   "We have to err on the side of caution," said John R. Anderson,
the Sierra Club's Klamath Basin issue coordinator. "If we don't,
we'll just keep pushing the species toward extinction."</TE>
<TE>   Others worried that the Bush administration will use the academy's
report to shirk responsibility to clean up the Klamath's water,
tainted by livestock manure, pesticides, fertilizers and other
contaminants.</TE>
<TE>   Some environmentalists said the administration is already
distorting the academy's findings to undermine the credibility of
government scientists who guard the nation's endangered species.</TE>
<TE>   Norton, who requested the report, said the academy findings would
color the administration's decision-making process in Klamath during
this and future years.</TE>
<TE>   "It's pretty brilliant spin on the administration's part," said
Steve Pedery of WaterWatch of Oregon. "They wanted to shift the
debate to a question suggesting federal scientists aren't
trustworthy."</TE>
<TE>   Pedery and others see it as part of a broader strategy to
challenge the Endangered Species Act.</TE>
<TE>   Last summer, Klamath became a hotbed of protest over the act, as
embattled farmers won support from demonstrators from throughout
rural America.</TE>
<TE>   "I think you're seeing a lot more common sense brought back into
the equation by this administration," said Robin Rivett, an attorney
with the Pacific Legal Foundation. "It's a balance that's
pro-environment and pro-economy."</TE>
<TE>   Pacific Legal Foundation, a Sacramento-based public advocacy
group, filed suit Tuesday to remove endangered species protection
from the coho salmon on the Klamath.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, Rivett's group won a legal victory to remove Oregon's
coastal coho from the endangered species list. That case is on
appeal.</TE>

<HD>Union Asks Panel to Halt Secession Bid</HD>
<DH>Labor: City Hall workers say a Valley city would not be
viable, but they don't call for a state review of LAFCO study.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PATRICK McGREEVY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The union representing most blue-collar workers at City Hall said
Tuesday it has formally asked the Local Agency Formation Commission
to reject the San Fernando Valley secession proposal on legal
grounds, arguing that the viability of a proposed city is uncertain.</LD>
<LD>   However, Service Employees International Union Local 347 has
decided against asking the state controller to review a financial
study by LAFCO that found cityhood is viable.</LD>
<LD>   Robert F. Hunt, the union's general counsel, said labor leaders do
not believe the study provided enough information on the effect of
secession on city workers to make a review productive.</LD>
<TE>   LAFCO's proposal to have a Valley city contract with Los Angeles
to provide all services for up to three years allows the commission
to elude the question of what would happen to city workers when the
contracts expire, Hunt said.</TE>
<TE>   In a letter to LAFCO, Hunt and union General Manager Julie Butcher
said the financial study "is materially defective because it is based
on untenable assumptions."</TE>
<TE>   "The [study] simply does not provide any form of reasonable
assurance that both a seceding San Fernando Valley city and the
remaining Los Angeles would be financially viable in the event of
secession," the union officials wrote, adding that the study does not
"adequately address the concerns of dedicated city employees."</TE>
<TE>   LAFCO officials will consider the union's position in deciding in
April whether there is enough evidence that Valley cityhood would be
financially viable without hurting Los Angeles and should be placed
on the November ballot.</TE>
<TE>   Valley secession leader Richard Close expressed confidence in the
LAFCO financial analysis. "I believe the LAFCO study has adequately
dealt with these issues and employee protections," he said.</TE>
<TE>   He welcomed the union decision not to seek a state controller
review, saying any review could delay getting the measure on the
November ballot.</TE>
<TE>   But the Los Angeles City Council's top advisor said he probably
will ask the panel on Friday to seek a state controller review of the
financial study on Valley cityhood. Chief Legislative Analyst Ron
Deaton has said the financial study is flawed and underestimates the
negative effect of secession on the Valley and the rest of Los
Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   "We will have a list of reasons for having the controller look at
it," Deaton said. "This is a very important issue and the citizens
have a right to know the information is correct."</TE>

<HD>Parks Flap Ushers in Hahn's Political Puberty</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Steve Lopez</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Eleven o'clock at City Hall, and Mayor Jim Hahn has just walked into
a crowded press room to show whether he's got any business being in
the building.</LD>
<LD>   I didn't expect much. The last time I saw Hahn work under
pressure, in a melee over a proposed bus route, he was so painfully
unprepared for the big time, he gave me chest pains.</LD>
<LD>   This time, the heat was hotter. Hahn was about to explain why a
white mayor, elected to office with nearly unanimous support from
black voters, had sided with a mostly white police union in an effort
to run a black police chief out of office.</LD>
<TE>   As for my question--does Hahn have any business being in the
building?--it's way too soon to know. But I got no chest pains this
time, and in his midlife journey to political manhood, Hahn appears
to have hit puberty.</TE>
<TE>   The mayor said his decision not to support LAPD Chief Bernard
Parks--whose fate is in the hands of the Police Commission Hahn
appointed-- had nothing to do with politics, or with the foaming
hotheads in the police union. He simply disagreed with Parks on how
to go after bad cops, police the city, and keep officers from jumping
ship.</TE>
<TE>   Asked about the racial implications of his decision, Hahn had a
quick reply. He said he hoped the city had grown beyond those kinds
of divisions.</TE>
<TE>   It's a smart answer. But it would carry more weight if Hahn hadn't
done everything but call Antonio Villaraigosa the Frito Bandito in
the mayoral campaign. You could also argue that Hahn has done a
number on the black community, having traded on his father's good
name during the campaign while giving no clue that he'd cut Parks
loose.</TE>
<TE>   "He implied real support for the police chief," says Kevin Hooks,
a Los Angeles businessman and national trustee with the Urban League.
Hooks, like many others in the African American community, feels
betrayed.</TE>
<TE>   The problem with Hahn, we must remember, is that puberty is a time
of clumsiness. Last week, on the subject of his appointments to
commissions, an awkward Hahn tried to explain how he managed to
ignore South Los Angeles after passing himself off as the best friend
of the black man since Abe Lincoln. And now, before those wounds have
been licked, he dumps Parks without first building a case for doing
it.</TE>
<TE>   But whether Hahn acted for reasons of conviction, politics, or
just felt the need to establish that he isn't a pushover, I'm going
to say something in the mayor's defense. Los Angeles ought not to be
choosing or holding onto a police chief on the basis of skin color,
simple as that.</TE>
<TE>   Given the LAPD history of brutality, we can all understand why the
African American community feels a sense of comfort in seeing a
Willie Williams or Bernard Parks at the helm. But if we wanted a top
cop who best reflected the new L.A. color-wise, wouldn't we go brown?</TE>
<TE>   And another thing. Despite a history of men being pulled over for
driving while black, the biggest threat in the neighborhood isn't the
Police Department. It's gangsters with guns cutting down everyone in
their sights, including innocent bystanders. And the crime rate, last
I checked, is not on Parks' side.</TE>
<TE>   There's only one question that matters as the Police Commission
figures out whether to send Parks into early retirement, and this is
it:</TE>
<TE>   Is he getting the job done?</TE>
<TE>   You could argue all day and night without a consensus, because
there is no easy answer. It's like trying to figure out if the school
principal is getting the job done, and you can't trust everything you
hear from teachers or students.</TE>
<TE>   Parks is a reformer who made the LAPD honest and professional in
ways it has never been. But morale has sunk because he's like the
overbearing Dad who inspects your plate after dinner and sends you
off to your room for not clearing every pea.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't have a problem with him going after bad cops," one
officer told me. "What bothers us is that we're trying to do our
jobs, and we keep getting called in because we haven't shined our
shoes to his specifications."</TE>
<TE>   With that same obsessive zeal, Parks has guarded his empire from
the highest turret, sniping at critics and heading off every attempt
to open the department to outside review by citizens or
professionals. We'll never know how deep and wide the Rampart scandal
ran because Bernard Parks, in the moment that sealed his entry into
the control freak hall of fame, wouldn't let anyone in to have a
look.</TE>
<TE>   You have to admire the man's confidence, ego, or whatever it was.
But how effective can he be with rock-bottom morale and a mayor he
refuses to work with?</TE>
<TE>   At the press conference, Hahn talked about what a tough decision
this was. I don't know. I think Parks made it easy for him.</TE>

<HD>George Nader, 80; Star of '50s Movies</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELAINE WOO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>George Nader, whose beefcake image made him a popular leading man in
movies of the 1950s, died of pneumonia Monday at the Motion Picture
Country Home in Woodland Hills. He was 80.</LD>
<LD>   A virile hero in the mode of Rock Hudson and Tony Curtis, Nader
made more than 50 films, including "Six Bridges to Cross" with
Curtis, "Lady Godiva" with Maureen O'Hara, and "Sins of Jezebel" with
Paulette Goddard.</LD>
<LD>   He later turned to television roles and writing. He wrote the
novel "Chrome," published in 1978, which occupied an unusual niche in
the science-fiction world for its exploration of love between two gay
robots.</LD>
<TE>   He was a close friend of Hudson and was named a beneficiary of the
actor's estate after his death from AIDS in 1985.</TE>
<TE>   Nader was born in Los Angeles and earned a degree in English from
Occidental College in 1943. During World War II he served in the Navy
as a communications officer in the Pacific Theater.</TE>
<TE>   After the war he studied at the Pasadena Playhouse, where his
performances drew the attention of Hollywood casting directors. He
landed a contract with Universal and had his first starring role in
the 1951 movie "Monsoon," opposite German actress Ursula Theiss.</TE>
<TE>   Another early movie, the 3-D "Robot Monster" in 1953, became a
cult classic that once was named one of the 50 worst movies in
history. It did well at the box office, however, and by 1954 Nader
was recognized with a Golden Globe as Most Promising Male Newcomer of
the year.</TE>
<TE>   His other screen appearances during the '50s included "Away All
Boats," a World War II action film that also starred Jeff Chandler,
and "The Second Greatest Sex," a musical about women out West going
on a sex strike to protest their men's violence that also featured
Bert Lahr, George Marshall and Mamie Van Doren.</TE>
<TE>   When movie offers began to fade, Nader turned to television. He
starred as the fictional detective Ellery Queen in a syndicated
version of the show that ran for one season in 1958-59. He also was
featured in the half-hour crime series "Shannon" in 1961.</TE>
<TE>   During the 1960s he acted in Europe in low-budget films, including
a string of action thrillers in West Germany.</TE>
<TE>   Nader retired from acting in 1974 after suffering an eye injury
and developing glaucoma.</TE>
<TE>   He was a major source for "Rock Hudson: His Story," the authorized
biography by Sara Davidson that was published in 1986. Davidson said
that Hudson and Nader became friends during Hudson's early years in
Hollywood, when both hid their homosexuality from the public, and
that they helped each other maintain a straight image.</TE>
<TE>   Nader's longtime companion, Mark Miller, worked as Hudson's
personal secretary for 13 years. He and Miller were among the few
confidants who knew that Hudson had AIDS. They were named
beneficiaries of the star's $27-million estate, which later became
the target of a lawsuit by Hudson's former lover, Marc Christian.</TE>
<TE>   A longtime Palm Springs resident, Nader is survived by Miller and
three cousins. Following a private service, Nader will be cremated
and his ashes scattered at sea.</TE>

<DH>Crime: Officers fire at driver after he pulls a gun during

<DL></DL>
<LD>A routine traffic stop escalated into gunfire on a freeway in the San
Fernando Valley on Tuesday morning when a man pointed a pistol at
police and then fled into a neighborhood, where he broke into two
homes to use a phone and steal a change of clothes, police said.</LD>
<LD>   There were no injuries to police or passing motorists in the
incident that began about 11:30 on the Hollywood Freeway near Roscoe
Boulevard, Los Angeles Police Sgt. John Pasquariello said. It was not
known if the suspect was wounded in the gunfire.</LD>
<LD>   The names of the officers involved in Tuesday's shooting were not
released.</LD>
<TE>   The LAPD issued a citywide tactical alert and searched 100 homes
in a six-square-block area of North Hollywood, utilizing K-9 units,
SWAT teams and helicopters.</TE>
<TE>   Officers were still searching the area Tuesday evening.</TE>
<TE>   School Locked Down During Police Search</TE>
<TE>   Nearby, school officials locked down Strathern Elementary School
as police closed off traffic inside a perimeter bounded by Laurel
Canyon Boulevard, Stagg Street, Cantera Avenue and Whitsett Street.</TE>
<TE>   The incident began when two LAPD officers pulled over a 1999 red
Chrysler Concord without license plates in the northbound lanes of
the Hollywood Freeway. Detectives believed the car may have been
stolen at gunpoint last week in Santa Clarita.</TE>
<TE>   "They approached the suspect's vehicle, and the suspect put the
gun out of the window," Pasquariello said. "Fearing for their lives,
they fired multiple times at the suspect."</TE>
<TE>   The man sped down the freeway and exited at Roscoe Boulevard.
Officers pursued him to Wilkinson Street, where the man abandoned the
car and ran, Pasquariello said.</TE>
<TE>   He forced his way into a home on Rhodes Avenue, where he made a
phone call, police said. He then ran a short distance to another
home, where he broke in and stole a change of clothes.</TE>
<TE>   Possible Link to Valley Slaying Investigated</TE>
<TE>   Police detectives are examining whether the suspect's vehicle is
linked to a gang-related slaying last week in the northeast Valley.</TE>
<TE>   The North Hollywood incident marked at least the fourth
officer-involved shooting in the Valley this year, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   In the most recent case, a San Fernando police officer exchanged
gunfire last week with a group of suspected auto thieves in Mission
Hills, leaving one man dead and an officer seriously wounded.</TE>

<LD>When the L.A. Daily News asked readers to suggest a name for a
secessionist city in the San Fernando Valley, one-fifth responded,
"San Fernando Valley."</LD>
<LD>   I guess it makes more sense than "San Gabriel Valley," but it's
not very exciting.</LD>
<LD>   Certainly it's less colorful than some of the names proposed by
Times readers a few years ago in a more whimsical poll: "Suburbank,"
"Beige-Air," "Reseceda," "Homes R Us," "McValley," and "Twenty-Nine
Malls," among others.</LD>
<TE>   But I did find it interesting that some Daily News readers
couldn't fully break away from L.A., nominating "Angeles Valley,"
"Valley of the Angels," "New Los Angeles," "Upper Los Angeles." Then
there's the more subtle "Nottelay." Rhymes with "Not L.A."</TE>
<TE>   Forget Fernando: Among those opposed to calling a new city "San
Fernando Valley" is Jose Hernandez, the mayor pro tem of San
Fernando. That's the city of San Fernando. And it's no new kid on the
block, having been founded in 1797 (in the Valley's pre-malls era).</TE>
<TE>   "We have our own identity," Hernandez told me. "Using the name
'San Fernando Valley' would rob us of our illustrious history."</TE>
<TE>   And, as far as I'm concerned, the new city can forget about
calling itself Valley of the Angels too.</TE>
<TE>   Attention shoppers: Among today's featured venues (see photos) was
one that Gavin McCullough of Los Osos, Calif., figured was the
setting for "Goldilocks and the Three Bears."</TE>
<TE>   Well-traveled Jackson Sleet of L.A., meanwhile, spotted a shoppers
warning on Sunset Boulevard and a tire shop with a curious name in
Alexandria, La.</TE>
<TE>   I called the tire dealer to ask if those were the owners' names in
the sign. Manager Kevin Roy said no, the wording was meant to be
taken literally.</TE>
<TE>   "They [the tires] may pop or they may not pop," he said with a
laugh. "We do give a two-week warranty."</TE>
<TE>   Mystery solved: Tuesday's column mentioned a for-sale item
described as a "coffin ... hardly used ... 21 inches by 18 inches
deep ... with small shelf."</TE>
<TE>   Erik Hayden of Torrance knew it wasn't used for burials. Disc
jockeys, he said, call their carrying cases "coffins."</TE>
<TE>   Diva of decaf: Between opera roles, singer Elizabeth Saunders
wanted a job with a flexible schedule and medical benefits. So the
USC grad took a gig working at Starbucks.</TE>
<TE>   But by "hollering orders over the noise of everything, I was
completely trashing my voice," she told USC Trojan Family Magazine.
So her store manager consented to having her sing out the orders. "It
wasn't about ego; it was about self-preservation," she said.</TE>
<TE>   The trained mezzo-soprano has belted out brews at several
Starbucks, the latest being in West Hartford, Conn., where she can be
close to auditions in New York City.</TE>
<TE>   Saunders admitted that her reviews have not all been positive. One
manager gave her this special request: "For my birthday, can you not
sing?"</TE>
<TE>   miscelLAny: In his LALA Land cyber-column, George Mair called the
"Kmart and Enron debacles symptomatic of the economy, where some
stores holding 'going out of business' sales actually are going out
of business." He added: "Restaurants still serve a businessman's
lunch but demand payment in advance."</TE>

<HD>Will Pastor's 'Divine Order' Meet Its Match in Bureaucrats?</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Dana Parsons</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Not to get overly philosophical about it, but ...</LD>
<LD>   Oh, what the heck. Let's do get philosophical about it.</LD>
<LD>   Such as, just where is it appropriate for a church congregation to
meet? Can it meet anywhere it wants?</LD>
<TE>   Of course not. We'd all agree the congregants can't march into a
shopping center and, in the name of God, hold services at the top of
the escalators. Or in a movie theater.</TE>
<TE>   How about a converted warehouse? Especially when the warehouse
owner is perfectly willing to let the church members use it?</TE>
<TE>   You'd think that wouldn't be such a big deal, but Huntington Beach
is tightening the screws a bit on the little church in the dell. And
rather than playing the little lamb, the pastor is coming on like a
lion.</TE>
<TE>   In this case, the pastor is Derek Anunciation, whose vision of his
Praise Christian Center sounds far too grand to be stopped by
something as mundane as municipal bureaucracy.</TE>
<TE>   "I got called out here [to Orange County from Chicago] with
nothing," Anunciation says. "We went from a community center to a
couple of storefronts to some of the most valuable property in
Southern California. It wasn't by accident. Every step in the last
31/2 years literally has taken a divine order."</TE>
<TE>   Whether the city of Huntington Beach will interpret that divine
order the same way remains to be seen. The city has said that the
warehouse isn't zoned for church use and will require extensive
modification if Anunciation wants to turn it into a sanctuary.</TE>
<TE>   Anunciation begs to differ, although he'd no doubt concede his
expertise is in theology, not city planning. However, Anunciation
says, he's got that covered, too: One of the congregants is a
professional in the field who says the warehouse-church looks fine to
him.</TE>
<TE>   The city has red-tagged the building, meaning it can't be used now
for assembly purposes. Not even that deters Anunciation, who clearly
sees himself as a man on a mission.</TE>
<TE>   "Realistically, as Christians, we should possess the land and be
an example to the rest of the world," he says. "I serve a God that
has a whole city made of gold."</TE>
<TE>   I don't want to start a fight where there might not be one.
Perhaps this will all blow over, and either Anunciation will make
whatever changes the city wants, or the city will just drop the whole
thing.</TE>
<TE>   But the warehouse, which is owned by a private individual and is
essentially being lent to the congregation, sits on pretty prime real
estate in Huntington Beach. My guess is that Anunciation's vision of
a "full-service Christian center" differs from that of city planners.</TE>
<TE>   Anunciation, 34, knows his local history. He knows Robert Schuller
started preaching in a drive-in movie parking lot and then built
Crystal Cathedral. He knows Paul Crouch started in a Tustin
industrial park and now is housed in a gilded building next to the
San Diego Freeway that would be at home between Caesar's Palace and
the Bellagio on the Las Vegas Strip.</TE>
<TE>   Anunciation also is thinking big. He gives the impression city
government is merely something to shoulder aside when the time comes.</TE>
<TE>   He says the church will file an application, as requested, to use
the warehouse as a meeting place. He isn't nearly as committal,
however, about making significant upgrades.</TE>
<TE>   "We're considering meeting again in the building, to get arrested
and to get this in front of a judge," he says.</TE>
<TE>   That is hardly the language of a man who sounds worried about city
zoning ordinances. "Everything in the building is up to current code
and is safe," he says.</TE>
<TE>   To the contrary, the city appears to be nothing more in
Anunciation's eyes than a misguided foe to be converted.</TE>
<TE>   "I love the city of Huntington Beach," Anunciation says. "I'm not
looking for a battle. What they've done is say, 'Come on, we want a
battle.'"</TE>
<TE>   The city has said no such thing, but it may end up in one, anyway.</TE>
<TE>   No word yet on whether God has picked a favorite.</TE>

<LD>It's the rare day that you can pull a laugh off the front page, but
there it was:</LD>
<LD>   Some cops are so peeved at the LAPD's new discipline drills that
they've run for help to that antichrist acronym, that outfit that a
U.S. attorney general once told the California Peace Officers Assn.
is a "criminals' lobby"--the ACLU.</LD>
<LD>   That was last year's antichrist. This year's is the chief, Bernard
C. Parks. The police union's somewhat squirrelly poll gave Parks a
thumbs-down rating of 93%. I say "squirrelly" because even Satan
doesn't get negatives like that.</LD>
<TE>   The story that made me laugh at the beginning had me banging my
head on the table by the end. My colleague Jill Leovy wrote about the
LAPD and the Christopher Commission reforms that Parks is enforcing.</TE>
<TE>   She wrote that the LAPD now gets two complaints for every three
cops, most for lesser offenses like "discourtesy."</TE>
<TE>   No one outside a rubber room can say the LAPD didn't need fixing.
Twelve, 15 years ago, for a cop to get busted for undue force, he
almost had to gun down a paraplegic in front of an archbishop. A few
guys driving patrol cars with "There's no excuse for domestic
violence" bumper stickers went home and smacked the old lady around.
A citizen complaint line set up after Rodney King practically had an
unlisted number.</TE>
<TE>   And so we come to life on the beat after the Christopher
Commission, after Rampart, and a different one it is. Reporters have
always known they can't just walk into a police station and say, "Hi,
why do you hate your boss?" and expect an answer.</TE>
<TE>   But now you can.</TE>
<TE>   Maybe even more than reporters, cops can be champion whiners. They
admit it. Think of a Dilbert cartoon with nightsticks.</TE>
<TE>   They hated Chief Willie Williams; now he doesn't look so bad. They
loathed the notion of civilian review; now it could be that civilians
are less critical than the LAPD brass.</TE>
<TE>   The other night, at a police station I'll not name, I started
talking to one cop. Others drifted in. When one heard I'm a reporter,
he slapped one hand over his nameplate and the other over his crotch.
But pretty soon he was telling tales too.</TE>
<TE>   * A veteran approved for a detective badge said he'd been told it
was stopped because in his dozen years, he had three "discourtesy"
complaints--smart-mouthing, mostly. He's joined other officers suing
over the discipline process.</TE>
<TE>   * A cop filling out a field investigation card asked the man his
"descent," his race--a required box on a required form. The man
didn't like the question and filed a complaint.</TE>
<TE>   * Myriad complaints are filed for trying "to convert an official
on-duty contact into an off-duty relationship," meaning a cop hit on
someone he met on the job. One told me, "Heck, I've met all my
girlfriends that way; Chief Parks met his wife that way."
(Technically, the effervescent Bobbie Parks approached the solemn
Bernard.)</TE>
<TE>   There are two ways of assessing how this new system can go askew.</TE>
<TE>   One is a twist on the broken-window theory already used on crime.
Let the little offenses slide, and the big ones get out of hand. Stop
the little stuff cold, the big stuff never happens. But who decides
what's "little stuff"?</TE>
<TE>   The second is the cry-wolf theory: Spend too much energy dithering
over the minor stuff and by the time the major stuff happens, no
one's listening any more.</TE>
<TE>   If this is about reform, listen to what one cop said: He was
putting a handcuffed gangbanger in a police car when the guy spit in
his face. The cop admits he'd have clocked him--if there hadn't been
a supervisor watching. Now the supervisors are inside thumbing
through complaint forms, when they should be outside stopping the
conduct that gets complaints in the first place.</TE>
<TE>   I asked Warren Christopher, the architect of reform, what he
thinks of this house of his designing, but he demurred, saying it's
for the police to answer.</TE>
<TE>   I also asked Joseph Wambaugh, the writer who once wore LAPD blue.
"The LAPD is still the same first-rate police force it always was, so
it's not the Christopher Commission stuff--that's just common sense.
It's Bernie Parks.... I was a big supporter of Bernie's." But he
"squandered the goodwill of the troops.... I'm afraid Bernie's just
gotta go."</TE>
<TE>   Now we find out that Mayor Jim Hahn agrees with Wambaugh.</TE>
<TE>   Just what we need, more of those thrilling days of yesteryear,
when the police chief and the mayor, Gates and Bradley, didn't speak
to each other for months on end.</TE>
<TE>   I remind you of the saying, when the elephants fight, the grass
gets trampled.</TE>
<TE>   My fellow Dichondra, get ready for the battle.</TE>

<HD>U.S. to Aid Island's War on Wild Pigs</HD>
<DH>Environment: Federal budget plan includes $2.1 million to
fence off the feral swine, which have caused trouble on Santa Cruz
for more than a century.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID KELLY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>More than a century of rooting and snorting may be coming to an end
on Santa Cruz Island as the federal government earmarks $2.1 million
for "pig-proof" fencing, the first step in corralling and killing off
thousands of destructive wild swine.</LD>
<LD>   The 44 miles of wire fencing will stretch over the jagged mountain
ridges and deep valleys of Santa Cruz, the largest of the eight
Channel Islands at 60,645 acres. The pigs will either be trapped and
killed or stalked by sharpshooters on foot and in helicopters. All
pigs should be eradicated in about six years, park officials said.</LD>
<LD>   "I'm jumping up and down on this one," said Tim Setnicka,
superintendent of Channel Islands National Park. "If you are in
charge of a national park with 5,000 pigs ripping up plants and
terrorizing the environment, you have to be ecstatic to get money to
move forward on this."</LD>
<TE>   Not everyone is happy about the plan. Animal rights activists say
it's inhumane to shoot the pigs and urged the park to use
contraceptives or euthanasia instead.</TE>
<TE>   The fencing funds are included in the Interior Department budget
proposal, which still needs congressional approval. If granted, the
money should arrive by next February and the fencing can begin.</TE>
<TE>   The multimillion-dollar fence is not merely pork-barrel politics,
officials said.</TE>
<TE>   At stake is the continued existence of endangered animal species
such as the island fox and plants including the Santa Cruz
bushmallow.</TE>
<TE>   "We are on the verge of losing species," said Gary Davis, an
ecologist and science advisor to the park. "How long can we hold off
extinction of the island fox? This is like triage at an accident
scene. You need to stop the bleeding before you set the leg. Removing
the pigs is a crucial step."</TE>
<TE>   Golden Eagles Feed on Pigs and Foxes</TE>
<TE>   Killing the pigs would eliminate the major food source for the
golden eagle, which also preys on the island fox.</TE>
<TE>   "We found the first golden eagle nest in 1997," Setnicka said.
"Prior to that, they have been in the park, but we have never seen
them nesting. We want the bald eagles back and then to make the
goldens transient. That will allow the foxes to recover."</TE>
<TE>   The park plans to reintroduce bald eagles to the islands this
summer. Bald eagles, which feed on carrion and fish, left the islands
in the late 1950s when DDT in the environment thinned their
eggshells. They don't eat island foxes.</TE>
<TE>   Pigs, on the other hand, survive easily on the islands.</TE>
<TE>   Today's occasionally boorish residents are descended from a herd
of domestic pigs kept on Santa Cruz by one M.J. Box of Santa Barbara.
Court records show that, in 1853, Box borrowed $2,000 from Thomas
Wallace More, using the pigs as collateral.</TE>
<TE>   When he didn't pay up in time, More tried to collect the swine.
But he found they had "become wild from abandonment and neglect."</TE>
<TE>   "There is nothing left but a certain number of wild swine ranging
among the precipitous hills of Santa Cruz, unapproachable, untamable
and daily hunted by the inhabitants of said island as fierce natured
and nuisances," More's lawyer wrote.</TE>
<TE>   Box, meanwhile, is said to have "absconded" from the state.</TE>
<TE>   Wild pigs are hairy, sometimes tusked and eat just about anything,
including each other, biologists say. They can also double their
population every four months.</TE>
<TE>   In a three-year effort beginning in the early 1990s, the park
service killed thousands of wild pigs on the 53,000-acre Santa Rosa
Island.</TE>
<TE>   "They are quite intelligent," Davis said. "They will hunker down
in the bush when they hear a helicopter.</TE>
<TE>   "After hunting them for a while, it gets harder and harder. Mom
gets wise to the helicopter, and the kids do too."</TE>
<TE>   Santa Cruz is the last wild pig stronghold in the Channel Islands
chain.</TE>
<TE>   A similar anti-swine effort is afoot on Catalina Island off the
coast of Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Peter Schuyler, director of ecological restoration for the Santa
Catalina Island Conservancy, said 17 miles of pig-proof fencing was
erected in 1999. He hopes the pigs will be gone in two years.</TE>
<TE>   Those pigs, imported from Santa Cruz in the 1930s for organized
boar hunts, also have outstayed their welcome, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "They eat acorns, so trees don't regenerate," Schuyler said. "They
rototill soil, which leads to erosion. They displace native animals
and reduce nesting sights.</TE>
<TE>   "They are barnyard pigs gone wild."</TE>
<TE>   Yet shooting seems cruel and unnecessary to some.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't understand why they are being slaughtered in the name of
conservation," said Stephanie Boyles, a wildlife biologist with
People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals. "They are there because
we put them there--it is our fault they exist there in the first
place."</TE>
<TE>   Contraceptive Darts, Euthanasia Urged</TE>
<TE>   Boyles proposed shooting the animals with darts full of
contraceptives. Failing that, the pigs should be trapped and
euthanized, she said.</TE>
<TE>   But Davis said using dart contraceptives is almost impossible
because it requires tracking the same animal and shooting it several
times during the length of its ovulation cycle.</TE>
<TE>   And shooting pigs in the head after they are trapped is as humane
as the way cattle are killed in slaughterhouses, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Pigs can't be brought back to the mainland because some carry
diseases that could infect domestic livestock, park officials said.</TE>
<TE>   The pig program will probably not affect tourism on Santa Cruz,
and the long-term effect will be positive, Setnicka said.</TE>
<TE>   "The parks will last forever," Setnicka said. "It will be
front-end investment for a very long-term benefit."</TE>

<HD>High Court to Reexamine Sexual Predator Law</HD>
<DH>Crime: Freedom for a serial rapist, and many others, hinges
on question of the likelihood of recidivism.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MAURA DOLAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>How likely is likely?</LD>
<LD>   The answer to that question may determine whether serial rapist
Patrick Ghilotti and other sexual predators are returned to the
streets after successfully completing a state-mandated mental health
program.</LD>
<LD>   The California Supreme Court, in a Sacramento hearing today, will
grapple with a 1996 state law that says sexual predators confined to
a state hospital after their prison terms can be released only if
experts determine they are no longer likely to offend again.</LD>
<TE>   The predictability of recidivism is a question that has long
tantalized mental health experts and social scientists. Study upon
study has been performed to determine the percentage of sex offenders
who will attack again after being returned to society.</TE>
<TE>   But whether any individual sex offender will be among those who
commit more crimes is extremely difficult to predict. The language of
the law does not always translate in psychiatry, and vague legal
standards often fail to reflect the realities of predicting future
threats.</TE>
<TE>   "It's like weather forecasting," said R. Karl Hanson, a Canadian
government researcher who is a leader in the field of predicting
future sexual violence.</TE>
<TE>   "You are predicting a probability, like a 30% chance of rain
tomorrow. You can't say it will or it won't rain."</TE>
<TE>   California is one of at least 15 states with laws that allow sex
offenders convicted of multiple crimes to be committed to state
hospitals after completing their prison terms.</TE>
<TE>   More than 1,200 offenders nationwide are behind bars because of
those laws. Only a few convicted predators have been released across
the country--too few to study recidivism rates.</TE>
<TE>   Ghilotti, 45, was to be the first in California to graduate from
hospital confinement under the state's sexual predator law. After he
spent four years at Atascadero State Hospital, three mental health
experts licensed by the state concluded that he should no longer be
confined.</TE>
<TE>   Ghilotti was convicted of four rapes and admitted to six others.
He served a 12-year prison term for his most recent rape.</TE>
<TE>   Just as he was supposed to walk out of Atascadero, the California
Supreme Court intervened. The court took his case on an accelerated
schedule in December and squeezed Ghilotti's hearing onto today's
calendar.</TE>
<TE>   The state's law has long been interpreted to require the release
of sexual predators from state hospitals if two independent mental
health experts determine they are no longer dangerous. Three experts
have said Ghilotti should be released.</TE>
<TE>   But Gov. Gray Davis and Atty. Gen. Bill Lockyer contend that
Ghilotti will probably attack again if returned to society, and the
California Supreme Court will decide whether the law provides a
vehicle for confining him longer.</TE>
<TE>   The court's ruling in People vs. Ghilotti, expected within 90 days
of the oral arguments, will shape the future for hundreds of sex
offenders in California.</TE>
<TE>   One of the major issues before the court is the correct legal
interpretation of the phrase "likely to engage in acts of sexual
violence."</TE>
<TE>   If the court eventually comes up with a legal standard for those
words, the mental health experts who evaluated Ghilotti or a judge
may have to determine whether the experts' findings complied with the
legal language.</TE>
<TE>   Legal scholars who specialize in mental health issues want the
courts to devise standards based on numerical probabilities. Those
would conform to what scientists are able to provide, the scholars
say.</TE>
<TE>   "We should at least know what ballpark we are in, whether we are
talking 51% likelihood or 90% likelihood," said Hastings law
professor David Faigman, who teaches science in the law and
constitutional law. "I think the Constitution demands that degree of
certainty."</TE>
<TE>   But appellate panels instead tend to offer vague standards that
are left to lower-court judges and juries to interpret.</TE>
<TE>   "Courts never define 'likely' or 'probable' in quantitative
terms," said John T. Monahan, a psychologist who holds a chair in the
law at the University of Virginia.</TE>
<TE>   "There have been a number of studies of judges asking them what
they meant by such terms as 'likely' and 'probable.' The results are
all over the map."</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors in the Ghilotti case said "likely" should be defined
as a "significant chance, not minimal," something less than "more
likely than not" and more than "merely possible."</TE>
<TE>   But Faigman said a standard based on a "significant" danger is too
vague. "Significant might be 25% or 45%," the law professor said.</TE>
<TE>   Ghilotti's lawyers argue that likely means more likely than not.</TE>
<TE>   Monahan, however, said that standard may not make sense to the
public. "That would mean that a court would have to discharge
somebody with a 49% probability of committing a violent act," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   "That would be an awfully high probability. We would certainly
never tolerate a 49% likelihood of harm in other circumstances, such
as the siting of a nuclear power plant," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Sentencing Reforms Created Problems</TE>
<TE>   W. Lawrence Fitch, director of the Office of Forensic Services for
the Maryland Mental Hygiene Administration, said new sexual predator
laws around the nation stem from sentencing reforms that had
unintended consequences.</TE>
<TE>   Until about two decades ago, convicted sex criminals served
indeterminate sentences. Most left prison on parole after about six
years, but the especially dangerous convicts were imprisoned far
longer, Fitch said.</TE>
<TE>   When states decided to impose fixed sentences, they based the
length of the prison terms on the average amount of time sex
offenders had been serving, Fitch said.</TE>
<TE>   That meant "the really bad guys" got out with the rest, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Washington was the first state to pass a sexual predator law. It
was approved amid public horror over a parolee who raped and sexually
mutilated a 7-year-old boy six months after leaving prison in 1989.</TE>
<TE>   Predator laws are continually being scrutinized by courts.</TE>
<TE>   "The real objection to these laws is whether we have any business
putting these people in psychiatric hospitals," Fitch said, "or are
we just using them to incapacitate criminals."</TE>
<TE>   Predator laws generally require a finding of a mental abnormality,
a personality disorder or a diagnosed mental disorder before an
offender can be committed to a state hospital. But the legal criteria
are not particularly based in psychiatry.</TE>
<TE>   Mental abnormalities "can include all kinds of conditions that are
nothing like mental illnesses that people would have to be
hospitalized for," Fitch said.</TE>
<TE>   Sexual predators are driven to rape or molest not because of their
sexual disorder, but largely because they are antisocial, a common
trait among criminals, Fitch said.</TE>
<TE>   "The sexual disorder shapes the individual's behavior, but it is
the personality disorder that drives it," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "There are a lot of people who are pedophiles and would prefer
children, but they don't molest children. They get their kicks
through pornography."</TE>
<TE>   Faigman said society has "selected sex offenses as a type of
behavior we want to label madness."</TE>
<TE>   "There is no reason why you couldn't take exactly the same
doctrine and apply it to muggers and burglars," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "We have decided to label a particular danger that we find
objectionable as a mental abnormality, which only has meanings in the
law and has no meanings in psychiatry."</TE>
<TE>   Although sex offenders are less likely than other felons to offend
again after their release, the rates of relapse are not reassuring.</TE>
<TE>   During the first four years after release, 10% to 15% of the
felons commit another sex offense, researchers say.</TE>
<TE>   A study of sex offenders who were eligible for the sexual predator
program in Washington but instead were freed found recidivism rates
of about 20% within a few years after release, according to Eric
Janus, a law professor at William Mitchell College of the Law in St.
Paul, Minn.</TE>
<TE>   The longer an offender is out, the more likely he is to commit
another sex crime. Hanson, the Canadian researcher, studied child
molesters over 20 years. Nearly 40% of them molested again, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Predictions of future violent sexual behavior hinge heavily on the
inmate's record. Those who are younger, who attacked strangers, who
had a poor relationship with their mothers and who are unmarried are
at higher risk than others, researchers said.</TE>
<TE>   Offenders Learn to Manage Impulses</TE>
<TE>   Treatment for those offenders typically involves teaching them
strategies to avoid situations that might prompt them to attack again
and to empathize with victims.</TE>
<TE>   The men are not cured of their sexual deviation, but they learn to
manage their impulses, researchers say.</TE>
<TE>   "Our best guess at this point is that well-designed, effective
treatment can lower recidivism rates by about 30% to 40%," Hanson
said.</TE>
<TE>   Experts say these offenders should be closely monitored after they
leave confinement.</TE>
<TE>   If Ghilotti is released, he will not be required to do anything
more than register as a sex offender.</TE>
<TE>   He has said, however, that he will voluntarily take medication to
reduce libido, wear a monitor to show his location and undergo
therapy.</TE>
<TE>   Hanson, in a 1981 study of about 400 sex offenders, found a higher
rate of repeat crimes among sexual predators taking medication to
reduce sex drive. That may be because the medication was given to the
highest-risk offenders, he said.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. Supreme Court has upheld the constitutionality of sexual
predator laws, and the state high court has ruled that California's
law is constitutional.</TE>
<TE>   To meet constitutional requirements, the laws must be aimed at
treatment and cannot serve as a mere pretext to keep dangerous felons
behind bars.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. Supreme Court ruled last month that the offenders cannot
be locked up beyond their prison terms without proof that they have
serious difficulty controlling their behavior.</TE>
<TE>   "The court is clearly concerned about the difference between civil
commitment because of the incapacity to control behavior in the
future and the ordinary recidivism risk," said J. Clark Kelso, a
professor at McGeorge School of Law.</TE>
<TE>   "The court wants to draw a distinction between that so you can't
use a sexually violent predator law simply to exact additional
retribution."</TE>
<TE>   Kelso said constitutional problems arise if men are locked up
"when you can't make a showing that they are more likely than not to
be a danger."</TE>
<TE>   California's predator law allows sex offenders who have committed
at least two violent sex crimes to be committed to a mental hospital
for two-year intervals if a court decides they are likely to commit
another offense.</TE>
<TE>   After the two years, the inmate can petition for release.</TE>
<TE>   Reports by evaluators who found Ghilotti no longer met the
requirements for commitment have not been made public.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a population that is not very sympathetic and, therefore,
none of us feels terribly aggrieved that Mr. Ghilotti's rights might
be trampled upon," Faigman said.</TE>
<TE>   "But the beauty of the Constitution is that it protects us, you
and me, when everybody else thinks we are most despicable."</TE>

<LD>Orange County supervisors Tuesday approved $120,000 a year for three
explosives-sniffing dogs and their handlers as part of new security
measures at John Wayne Airport.</LD>
<LD>   Costs include three new vehicles, kennel construction and dog runs
at the airport and handlers' homes. Sheriff's deputies will serve as
dog handlers, said Alan Murphy, airport director. Start-up costs will
be $222,000 in the first year, an airport spokeswoman said.</LD>
<LD>   Two teams are to be on duty by spring 2002, with a third team by
next fall, Murphy said. The teams are required under new Federal
Aviation Administration rules after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.</LD>

<LD>A Laguna Niguel man accused of stabbing his wife to death in front of
their children was charged Tuesday in her murder.</LD>
<LD>   Arnulfo Perez Rios, 44, made his first court appearance at South
Justice Center in Laguna Niguel, where Orange County Superior Court
Judge Carl Biggs set bail at $250,000 and set arraignment for Feb.
22.</LD>
<LD>   Rios, an electrical engineer, faces one count each of murder and
use of a weapon. The maximum punishment if he is convicted is 26
years to life in prison, Deputy Dist. Atty. Tom Glazier said.</LD>
<TE>   Arnulfo Rios repeatedly stabbed Maria Andrade Rios, 40, in the
neck and upper body with a kitchen knife in a bedroom of their Laguna
Hills apartment on Hidden Hills Drive late Saturday, police said.</TE>
<TE>   Three of the couple's five children were home at the time. The
daughters, ages 11, 13 and 18, ran outside to seek help and call 911,
said Jim Amormino, spokesman for the Orange County Sheriff's
Department. Neighbors rushed to the bedroom, where they tried to save
Maria Rios and restrained her husband.</TE>
<TE>   While waiting for police to arrive, Arnulfo Perez Rios, who
witnesses said was covered in blood and smelled of alcohol, told a
neighbor that he was upset with his wife for cursing at him.</TE>
<TE>   Rios was on suicide watch Tuesday at Orange County Jail in Santa
Ana, authorities said.</TE>
<TE>   The couple's children are staying with relatives.</TE>

<HD>Federal Funds for Rocketdyne Cleanup Could Be Slashed in
Upcoming Budget</HD>
<DH>Environment: Energy Department proposes to cut more than $3
million. Area lawmakers fought off an earlier attempt to curtail the
project at the testing lab.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HOLLY J. WOLCOTT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The U.S. Department of Energy said this week it is proposing to slash
more than $3 million from its upcoming budget for cleanup operations
at the federal government's former nuclear testing facility near Simi
Valley.</LD>
<LD>   Environmentalists worry that if the reduction is approved by
Congress it could mean soil, water supplies and research buildings
contaminated during four decades of nuclear testing at the Santa
Susana Field Laboratory would remain at the site.</LD>
<LD>   "It seems incomprehensible that the federal government, which
created the contamination at this federal facility through decades of
sloppy practices, would attempt to weasel out of its obligation to
clean up the mess it made," nuclear policy activist Daniel Hirsch
said.</LD>
<TE>   Representatives from Boeing Co., which owns the land where the
contamination occurred, said the proposed reduction--from $17.2
million to about $13.7 million in fiscal 2002-03--would not
dramatically affect cleanup efforts.</TE>
<TE>   Rocketdyne, a division of Boeing, has contracted with the
government to perform the cleanup. Since the $250-million restoration
project began in 1989, several dozen contaminated buildings have been
razed, but the tainted soil remains.</TE>
<TE>   "Less money means less cleanup activity.... But our commitment
remains to complete the cleanup in a timely manner so that it is
protective of people's health and the environment," said Dan Beck, a
Boeing spokesman.</TE>
<TE>   This is at least the second time federal officials have attempted
to slash funding for the cleanup. Last fiscal year, federal
legislators from Ventura County successfully led a push to return
$3.7 million to the cleanup budget that had been proposed for
elimination.</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.), a longtime advocate for the
cleanup, said Tuesday she will again fight to have the funding
restored.</TE>
<TE>   "I was shocked to hear that funding for the cleanup of the
Rocketdyne site was cut in the president's budget proposal. The
proposed funding is not enough to clean up the site," Boxer said.</TE>
<TE>   The government began nuclear testing at the Rocketdyne site in the
mid-1950s and continued until 1989. A partial fuel meltdown occurred
at the lab in 1959.</TE>
<TE>   The cleanup aims to rid soil, buildings and water from
contamination that occurred during the nuclear research, but budget
cuts over the years have slowed the effort, and some critics believe
a 2007 completion date will not be met.</TE>
<TE>   Hirsch believes there is a strong possibility the Department of
Energy will dramatically scale back its cleanup efforts in order to
more quickly return the property to Boeing, which could then sell the
land.</TE>
<TE>   Early last month federal energy officials announced they were
considering three alternatives for the remainder of the cleanup,
records show.</TE>
<TE>   A leading proposal would be to remove only enough contamination
from the property so the possible risk of cancer would be about 1 in
3,000, Hirsch said. The federal Environmental Protection Agency has
said the preferred ratio should be 1 in a million.</TE>
<TE>   Hirsch said he believes it could be only a matter of time before
energy officials walk away from the cleanup effort for good.</TE>
<TE>   A public comment period on the energy department's options runs
through Feb. 25.</TE>

<HD>Thousand Oaks Legal Win Seen as Far-Reaching</HD>
<DH>Litigation: The Supreme Court victory in Civic Arts Plaza
dispute may have preserved the state's competitive bidding process,
government officials say.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JENIFER RAGLAND</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Thousand Oaks' success in court against a contractor seeking $2.7
million in cost overruns for its work on the Civic Arts Plaza was a
major victory for all California municipalities and taxpayers,
government officials said Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   At stake in the six-year battle was the concept of competitive
bidding, a state law aimed at saving taxpayer dollars by keeping
costs down on major public works projects.</LD>
<LD>   "It's a huge relief for public agencies and the taxpaying public,"
said JoAnne Speers, general counsel for the League of California
Cities.</LD>
<TE>   Attorneys who represent public contractors, meanwhile, predicted
the ruling, issued Monday by the state Supreme Court, will result in
more expensive public construction projects that will drag on longer
or never be completed.</TE>
<TE>   The decision overturns two lower-court findings in favor of Amelco
Electric of Gardena, one of the nation's largest electrical
contractors. Amelco sued Thousand Oaks in 1996, one year after the
$63.8-million Civic Arts Plaza was finished, claiming that it was not
bound by the fixed price of its contract because the city made too
many last-minute changes to design plans.</TE>
<TE>   Amelco attorneys did not return phone calls seeking comment
Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   The company--paid $7.2 million for its work--sought an extra $2.7
million, including interest, under a legal theory called
"abandonment." In an abandonment case, an original contract changes
so much it becomes invalid, entitling the contractor to recover all
extra costs on the project, Thousand Oaks City Atty. Mark Sellers
said.</TE>
<TE>   The Supreme Court concluded that the abandonment argument does not
apply to public agencies, which are forced to award contracts based
entirely on who was the lowest responsible bidder.</TE>
<TE>   If a contractor wants to file claims against a public agency for
costs not covered in the initial agreement or approved in a written
change order, the high court ruled, it must prove the agency directly
caused damage by the changes.</TE>
<TE>   Although Thousand Oaks has spent about $1 million over the years
defending the lawsuit, Sellers said it was an important fight.
Already this year, for instance, the city has more than $30 million
in public contracts underway, he said.</TE>
<TE>   And the case's potential effect on the state's competitive-bidding
law--designed to protect taxpayers from excessive costs in public
works projects--caught the attention of cities, counties and other
public agencies throughout the state.</TE>
<TE>   Had Amelco prevailed in the Supreme Court, that law essentially
would have become "a sham," Sellers said. That was the court's
rationale in siding with Thousand Oaks in the 5-2 decision.</TE>
<TE>   "One can imagine a situation where a friend of a public official
bids extremely low, with the understanding that numerous changes in
the contract ... will be forthcoming," the written opinion said.</TE>
<TE>   "Such scenarios would simply provide an end run around the public
works bidding requirements."</TE>
<TE>   Although officials acknowledged one effect of the ruling may be
higher bids, they said the decision will save public money in the
long run.</TE>
<TE>   "If contractors make a more careful and realistic bid--even though
it's higher--the ultimate result will be a reduction in claims,
because claims will be harder to make," said Nowland C. Hong, a Los
Angeles attorney who filed a brief in support of Thousand Oaks on
behalf of 98 California cities.</TE>
<TE>   But Neil H. O'Donnell, a San Francisco attorney who represents
contractors on public works projects, said this week's ruling will
have the opposite effect.</TE>
<TE>   "You're going to have projects that take longer to complete and be
more expensive to get done in the end," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "And you're going to have very large-scale and bitter litigation."</TE>

<LD>The Camp Paradise homeless plan to resurrect their riverside
encampment, but the city has said it will boot any squatters.</LD>
<LD>   "I'm going all the way," camp founder Larry Templeton said, vowing
to pitch tents this week along the San Lorenzo River near the
California 1 bridge. About 15 people were expected to move into Camp
Paradise, which had 50 residents in its heyday last year.</LD>
<LD>   The encampment existed openly from February 2001 until the river
washed it away in December. Police had been threatening to roust the
campers for months while City Council members tried to negotiate a
compromise.</LD>

<LD>The new chief of a state agency that helps finance housing for
victims of domestic violence told lawmakers Tuesday that the Davis
administration has come up with $4 million to pay for
battered-women's shelters for two more years.</LD>
<LD>   N. Allen Sawyer made the surprise announcement at a hearing called
to examine an administration error last year in which 10 shelters
were denied funds, partly because their applications were incorrectly
typed or too long.</LD>
<LD>   Sawyer told the legislators that the $4 million will be included
in Davis' proposed state budget to continue funding the 10 shelters.</LD>
<TE>   He said the $4 million is surplus from a $50-million project to
help reduce the backlog of DNA tests from old rape cases.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>A civil lawsuit over the drinking death of a Chico State University
freshman will be tried in Butte County rather than in San Francisco,
where it was filed.</LD>
<LD>   The suit was brought by the student's parents in May against Pi
Kappa Phi Fraternity and nine members of the now-abolished Chico
chapter. The lawsuit alleges that they took part in or condoned an
alcoholic hazing ritual that led to the Oct. 7, 2000, death of Adrian
Heideman, 18, of Palo Alto.</LD>
<LD>   A San Francisco judge upheld defense motions transferring the
civil case to Butte County, where the death occurred. Butte County is
where most of the defendants live.</LD>

<LD>Record attendance at Six Flags Marine World last year has turned into
record revenue share for the city of Vallejo.</LD>
<LD>   Six Flags gave Vallejo officials a $1.1-million check which,
combined with a $1.8-million advance the city got in October, gives
Vallejo $2.9 million from the theme park. Vallejo Mayor Tony
Intintoli said the check exceeds the city's expectations.</LD>
<LD>   Last year, the city received $2.3 million from Six Flags as part

<HD>Analysis of Billboard Laws Sought</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A City Council panel called Tuesday for an analysis of competing
billboard regulation proposals, including a ban on new signs in Los
Angeles and another measure that would allow new signs along freeways
in exchange for others being removed.</LD>
<LD>   The Planning and Land Use Management Committee also asked the
chief legislative analyst and city attorney to determine the
feasibility of a proposed ballot measure that would impose a $20,000
annual tax or fee on existing billboards.</LD>
<LD>   The committee heard support for the ban Tuesday from numerous
homeowner activists from Silver Lake, Westwood, Studio City, Van Nuys
and Encino.</LD>
<TE>   "Moving billboards from the streets to the freeways is no
solution," said Gerald Silver, president of Homeowners of Encino.</TE>
<TE>   "That's like moving dust and dirt from one room to another. That
isn't acceptable."</TE>
<TE>   But Councilman Hal Bernson of Granada Hills said the ban proposed
by Councilwoman Cindy Miscikowski would not get rid of existing
billboards.</TE>
<TE>   The councilman said that would be achieved by the proposed freeway
deal.</TE>
<TE>   He also said the city may not be able to legally impose a new tax
on billboards because of 1st Amendment protections.</TE>

<HD>Simon Draws Conservative Line in Sand</HD>
<DH>Campaign: The Republican tries to whip up support from
party faithful in his challenge to the front-runner in the GOP
gubernatorial race, Richard Riordan.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NICHOLAS RICCARDI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Republican gubernatorial candidate Bill Simon Jr. tried to rev up the
conservative faithful Tuesday at a quick-stop rally in Arcadia, where
he portrayed next month's primary as "about the heart and soul of the
Republican Party."</LD>
<LD>   Although he never mentioned him by name, Simon--a Pacific
Palisades businessman who calls himself "a proud conservative
Republican"--contrasted his stance with that of front-runner and
former Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan, an outspoken moderate.</LD>
<LD>   "Sometimes you have certain events that you know are going to be
very crucial in the history of an organization, and this upcoming
primary--make no mistake about it--is about our very heart and soul,"
he told about four dozen supporters who crammed into a small
Republican Party office during lunchtime.</LD>
<TE>   "You have some people saying that only a liberal can lead our
party forward," Simon said. "Do you believe that?"</TE>
<TE>   "No!" the crowd shouted back.</TE>
<TE>   "Liberals," Simon continued, "do not have any monopoly on good
ideas, on inclusiveness or on compassion."</TE>
<TE>   Simon, the son of Nixon-era Treasury Secretary William E. Simon,
and Secretary of State Bill Jones are trying to attract Republicans
who may be turned off by Riordan, who has supported abortion rights
and immigrant rights and has backed many Democrats. Simon has been
more reluctant to criticize Riordan, a personal friend.</TE>
<TE>   Simon's stop in Arcadia was part of a two-day campaign swing that
included stops in San Diego and Santa Maria. It was geared toward
charging up his supporters before this weekend's state Republican
Party convention in San Jose.</TE>
<TE>   "The whole goal of this week was to get him to do grass-roots
events and draw that distinction that everybody's waiting for him to
draw," spokesman Jamie Fisfis said.</TE>
<TE>   Simon spoke about the importance of honesty in government and the
need for more charter and magnet schools. He bashed Gov. Gray Davis
for his handling of last year's energy crisis.</TE>
<TE>   Some of those on hand to hear Simon said he sounded the right
notes.</TE>
<TE>   "I feel he's someone we can trust," said Donna Wilcher of Arcadia.</TE>

<HD>County Seeks Funds to Add Beds for Juvenile Offenders</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID REYES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Orange County's Probation Department, badly in need of more beds for
juveniles, won supervisors' approval Tuesday to seek $18 million in
federal funds to build three 60-bed facilities in Orange and demolish
several buildings built in the 1950s.</LD>
<LD>   Stephanie W. Lewis, chief probation officer, said the department
is handling short-term overcrowding by leasing space for juvenile
offenders at Santa Ana Jail and the County Jail.</LD>
<LD>   "We need to keep up with youth bed needs," Lewis said. "At
Juvenile Hall, we have four units that were original structures built
in 1957. Under the proposal, those structures, which house 80 beds,
will be razed and in their place we will get 180 new beds."</LD>
<TE>   Repairing the original structures is no longer cost-effective,
Lewis said.</TE>
<TE>   The proposal comes as the department is advancing controversial
plans to build a 60-bed youth facility called Rancho Potrero
Leadership Academy at the Joplin youth camp in Trabuco Canyon.</TE>
<TE>   Canyon residents have sued the department, alleging that the
project violates state environmental guidelines. The department
denies the allegations.</TE>
<TE>   Probation officials say facilities such as Joplin and Juvenile
Hall are overcrowded and won't meet the projected need.</TE>
<TE>   They estimate that 726 "secure" beds will be needed in a locked,
guarded facility such as Juvenile Hall by 2005; it has 538 beds now.
They say they will need 605 "nonsecure" beds, such as those at
Joplin, by 2005. There are 314 now.</TE>
<TE>   Lewis said chances are good that federal funds, administered by
the state Board of Corrections in Sacramento, will be approved. The
county would then pay 25%, or about $5.7 million, in matching funds,
which would bring the project's total to about $24 million, Lewis
said.</TE>
<TE>   The proposal calls for demolishing four of the original 20-bed
dorms and building three, 60-bed facilities, classrooms and secure
parking facilities for staff.</TE>
<TE>   The department now leases about 168 juvenile beds at three
locations in Santa Ana: the County Jail, Santa Ana's new jail
facility and Santa Ana's former jail, which the Probation Department
considers its juvenile annex.</TE>
<TE>   At Santa Ana Jail, the department has a 64-bed wing for juveniles
remanded to adult court. There is also a 64-bed unit at the County
Jail for 18-year-old juveniles on probation or serving a juvenile
sentence.</TE>
<TE>   The so-called annex is a 40-bed facility that serves as a
transitional lockup for juveniles going from Juvenile Hall into the
juvenile area at the Santa Ana Jail.</TE>

<HD>Ex-Teacher Strikes Deal in Molestation Case</HD>
<DH>Courts: The former Valley elementary school instructor
pleads no contest to 15 counts involving 10 girls. He could spend the
rest of his life in prison.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEAN GUCCIONE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A former San Fernando Valley elementary schoolteacher pleaded no
contest Tuesday to 15 counts of molesting 10 girls between 1968 and
1996, including two Vietnamese refugees who lived with him.</LD>
<LD>   Paul Alphonse Kreutzer, 63, of Canyon Country, could spend the
rest of his life in state prison.</LD>
<LD>   Under a plea deal, Kreutzer would be sentenced to 16 years in
prison plus nine consecutive terms of one year to life.</LD>
<TE>   His sentence is complicated because the older crimes are
punishable under indeterminate sentencing laws no longer on the
books.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge Barry A. Taylor set
Kreutzer's sentencing for March 5.</TE>
<TE>   Some of the victims, most now in their 30s, contacted authorities
after Kreutzer was arrested by the FBI in March 2000 for downloading
child pornography off the Internet.</TE>
<TE>   Others were contacted by members of the FBI's Sexual Assault
Felony Team as part of a broader investigation into the child
molestation allegations, Thompson said.</TE>
<TE>   Kreutzer, who was teaching at Liggett Elementary School in
Panorama City at the time of his arrest, pleaded guilty to the
federal charges. He was sentenced last June to 30 months in prison.</TE>
<TE>   "It took a lot of courage for these women to come forward so many
years later," especially after some were rebuffed by school officials
nearly three decades earlier, said Deputy Los Angeles County Dist.
Atty. Andrea Thompson.</TE>
<TE>   "They were willing to testify in open court about these traumatic
events," Thompson said. Some of the girls reported the abuse to
school officials in the 1970s, but their allegations were dismissed
without investigation.</TE>
<TE>   The principal at Our Lady of Peace Elementary School in North
Hills called one victim "a filthy, little lying girl" when she
reported being sexually abused by Kreutzer, the victim testified last
year at the preliminary hearing.</TE>
<TE>   On Tuesday, dozens of prospective jurors lingered in the hallway
for hours as Kreutzer and his lawyer, Rose Reglos, considered whether
to accept the plea deal.</TE>
<TE>   Kreutzer was charged last year with 31 counts of lewd conduct upon
a child younger than 14. Sixteen of those counts will be dismissed
under the plea agreement.</TE>
<TE>   The ex-teacher has pleaded no contest to at least one count
involving each of his victims. But he has not publicly expressed
remorse for his actions nor has he admitted molesting any of the
girls.</TE>
<TE>   Kreutzer has reserved his right to appeal the constitutionality of
his conviction, Reglos said.</TE>
<TE>   He may challenge whether he can be charged with old crimes that
usually would have an eight-year statute of limitations, she said.</TE>
<TE>   He was charged under a state law that allows prosecutors to file
cases involving child victims of sexual assaults for up to a year
after they are first reported to authorities.</TE>
<TE>   Reglos said Kreutzer initiated the plea with prosecutors Tuesday
to spare the two Vietnamese sisters who lived with him as children
from having to testify against him at trial.</TE>
<TE>   "The bottom line is he didn't want to put his daughters through
it," she said. "He loves those girls."</TE>
<TE>   Kreutzer considers the women his daughters, although he never
legally adopted them, Reglos said. The women called him "Daddy."</TE>
<TE>   Kreutzer met the Vietnamese family in 1975 through Holy Redeemer
Roman Catholic Church in Montrose and offered to help the children
learn English and integrate into the community, one victim testified
at the preliminary hearing.</TE>
<TE>   They moved into his La Crescenta apartment for a few years, before
settling into a Canyon Country trailer park, where the sexual abuse
escalated, she testified.</TE>
<TE>   Kreutzer's oldest victim, now 44, said she met him in 1968 through
a dance group he organized. It met on Saturdays at Holy Redeemer.</TE>
<TE>   The youngest victim is now 15. She was one of his students at
Sunland Elementary School in 1996.</TE>
<TE>   She testified that Kreutzer invited her to his trailer and got her
to disrobe while playing "Simon says" at his house.</TE>
<TE>   Kreutzer also taught at Our Lady of Perpetual Help in Newhall and
Vena Avenue Elementary School in Pacoima. He was dismissed by Los
Angeles Unified School District on Nov. 26, 2001.</TE>

<HD>O.C. Tollway's Bonds Downgraded</HD>
<DH>Transit: More than $1 billion in notes that funded the San
Joaquin Hills Transportation Corridor are given 'junk' rating as
traffic and revenue fall short.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAN WEIKEL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The financial picture for the struggling San Joaquin Hills toll road
in west Orange County worsened Tuesday, when a major Wall Street
ratings agency downgraded more than $1 billion in bonds to junk
status because traffic and revenue continue to fall short of
projections.</LD>
<LD>   Citing higher potential risks for investors, New York-based Fitch
IBCA lowered the rating for more than half of the tollway's $1.8
billion in bonds from BBB-minus, the lowest investment grade, to BB,
or speculative grade--so-called junk bonds.</LD>
<LD>   Toll road officials said paying customers won't be affected by the
lowered rating and that the turnpike's financial future appears
sound.</LD>
<TE>   But one director of the agency that oversees the tollway said the
downgrade raises serious concerns about the road's future.</TE>
<TE>   Tuesday's rating change is the second time in two years that the
agency has downgraded bonds that were sold to finance the 15-mile
tollway that runs from Newport Beach to just north of San Juan
Capistrano.</TE>
<TE>   In February 2000, Fitch lowered its rating from BBB to BBB-minus
because the growth in traffic and revenue from the tollway had fallen
short of 1997 estimates. Late last year, Standard &amp; Poor's, another
rating agency, concluded that the financial outlook for the turnpike
was bleak.</TE>
<TE>   "There has been a meaningful downward shift, from the 1997
forecast, in the growth rate of revenue over the past two years,"
said Cherian George, a senior director at Fitch Ratings. "With the
compounded effects of a toll increase in July 2001 and the recession,
traffic performance in fiscal year 2001 has been tepid."</TE>
<TE>   George and other bond consultants say the downgrade will hurt toll
road investors by lowering the value of $789million in uninsured
bonds issued in 1997 and $220million in revenue bonds sold in 1993.
An additional $795million in San Joaquin Hills bonds sold by the
agency in 1997 still retain their AAA rating because they are
insured.</TE>
<TE>   Standard &amp; Poor's and Moody's Investors Service, a third rating

turnpike's bonds.</TE>
<TE>   The San Joaquin Hills toll road is part of a 51-mile network of
Orange County tollways operated by the Transportation Corridor
Agencies, based in Irvine. Figures dating to 1998 show that the
tollway has never met its annual projections for traffic and revenue.</TE>
<TE>   TCA officials had forecast that the turnpike would generate almost
$37million in toll revenue for the last six months of 2001. The
actual amount was about $28million. For fiscal year 2000-01, the TCA
projected toll revenue of more than $63million but received about
$51million.</TE>
<TE>   "We are disappointed" at the lowered rating, said Walter D.
Kreutzen, the chief executive for TCA. "However, this action will
have no impact on the agency's ability to make its debt payments,
operate the road or service our customers."</TE>
<TE>   The TCA has substantial resources available, including $140million
in cash reserves and a $12-million line of credit from the federal
government, which has never been tapped.</TE>
<TE>   The agency is also set to increase tolls again throughout its
system Sunday, which could increase revenue by about $3.1 million a
year.</TE>
<TE>   Fares at the main San Joaquin Hills toll plaza will increase from
$2.50 to $3 for cash-paying drivers who travel the entire road any

during peak travel times.</TE>

<HD>O.C. Tollway Bonds Are Downgraded</HD>
<DH>Transit: More than $1 billion in notes that funded the San
Joaquin Hills Transportation Corridor are given 'junk' rating as
traffic and revenue fall short.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAN WEIKEL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The financial picture for the struggling San Joaquin Hills toll road
in west Orange County worsened Tuesday, when a major Wall Street
ratings agency downgraded more than $1 billion in bonds to junk
status because traffic and revenue continue to fall short of
projections.</LD>
<LD>   Citing higher potential risks for investors, New York-based Fitch
IBCA lowered the rating for more than half of the tollway's $1.8
billion in bonds from BBB-minus, the lowest investment grade, to BB,
or speculative grade--so-called junk bonds.</LD>
<LD>   Toll road officials said paying customers won't be affected by the
lowered rating and that the turnpike's financial future appears
sound.</LD>
<TE>   But one director of the agency that oversees the tollway said the
downgrade raises serious concerns about the road's future.</TE>
<TE>   Tuesday's rating change is the second time in two years that the
agency has downgraded bonds that were sold to finance the 15-mile
tollway that runs from Newport Beach to just north of San Juan
Capistrano.</TE>
<TE>   In February 2000, Fitch lowered its rating from BBB to BBB-minus
because the growth in traffic and revenue from the tollway had fallen
short of 1997 estimates. Late last year, Standard &amp; Poor's, another
rating agency, concluded that the financial outlook for the turnpike
was bleak.</TE>
<TE>   "There has been a meaningful downward shift, from the 1997
forecast, in the growth rate of revenue over the past two years,"
said Cherian George, a senior director at Fitch Ratings. "With the
compounded effects of a toll increase in July 2001 and the recession,
traffic performance in fiscal year 2001 has been tepid."</TE>
<TE>   George and other bond consultants say the downgrade will hurt toll
road investors by lowering the value of $789million in uninsured
bonds issued in 1997 and $220million in revenue bonds sold in 1993.
An additional $795million in San Joaquin Hills bonds sold by the
agency in 1997 still retain their AAA rating because they are
insured.</TE>
<TE>   Standard &amp; Poor's and Moody's Investors Service, a third rating
agency, have yet to reevaluate their investor-grade ratings of the
turnpike's bonds.</TE>
<TE>   The San Joaquin Hills toll road is part of a 51-mile network of
Orange County tollways operated by the Transportation Corridor
Agencies, based in Irvine.</TE>
<TE>   Figures dating to 1998 show that the tollway has never met its
annual projections for traffic and revenue.</TE>
<TE>   TCA officials had forecast that the turnpike would generate almost
$37million in toll revenue for the last six months of 2001. The
actual amount was about $28million. For fiscal year 2000-01, the TCA
projected toll revenue of more than $63million but received about
$51million.</TE>
<TE>   "We are disappointed" at the lowered rating, said Walter D.
Kreutzen, the chief executive for TCA. "However, this action will
have no impact on the agency's ability to make its debt payments,
operate the road or service our customers."</TE>
<TE>   The TCA has substantial resources available, including $140million
in cash reserves and a $12-million line of credit from the federal
government, which has never been tapped.</TE>
<TE>   The agency is also set to increase tolls again throughout its
system Sunday, which could increase revenue by about $3.1 million a
year.</TE>
<TE>   Fares at the main San Joaquin Hills toll plaza will increase from
$2.50 to $3 for cash-paying drivers who travel the entire road any
time of day.</TE>
<TE>   Those who use a FasTrak transponder, an electronic billing device,
will pay a maximum of $2.75, a 25-cent increase, during peak travel
times.</TE>
<TE>   Kreutzen said the San Joaquin Hills toll road made a scheduled
debt payment of $35.9 million three weeks ago.</TE>
<TE>   The TCA will make all future bond payments and the financial
picture looks "very strong" for the agency over the next five years,
he said.</TE>
<TE>   "We are not in a panic mode yet. We will be fine at least until
2007," said Orange County Supervisor Todd Spitzer, who sits on the
San Joaquin Hills board of directors. "But we had better do a reality
check about this toll road in 2008 and beyond to determine what we
are going to put into place to ensure its solvency."</TE>
<TE>   Spitzer said the projected performance of the San Joaquin Hills
has been dramatically overstated since the beginning. The elected
officials who sit on the tollway board already are doing a lot of
soul-searching, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "Is our duty to the bondholders or our constituency, those who
elected us?" Spitzer said. "The magic answer isn't always going to be
raising tolls."</TE>
<TE>   In their rating report, Fitch analysts said the growth in traffic
and revenue for the San Joaquin Hills toll road has been 9% to 10% a
year, several percentage points below projections. There has been
some concern that the growth rate might not keep pace with the road's
debt payments, which are scheduled to increase over the years.</TE>
<TE>   Fitch analysts said they remain confident in the TCA's ability and
willingness to deal with the increasing economic risks of the San
Joaquin Hills tollway. But they contend that the effects of the
impending toll increases remain unclear.</TE>
<TE>   The Fitch report said traffic and toll revenue for other turnpikes
operated by the TCA generally have exceeded projections. Fitch has
rated the bonds sold to build the Foothill and Eastern tollways as
BBB investment grade.</TE>

<HD>2 Council Candidates Endorse Mayor's Decision on Parks</HD>
<DH>Campaign: Cardenas and Greuel back Hahn's opposition to a
second term for police chief.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PATRICK McGREEVY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The two 2nd District candidates for the Los Angeles City Council on
Tuesday endorsed Mayor James K. Hahn's decision to oppose another
five-year term for Police Chief Bernard Parks.</LD>
<LD>   Assemblyman Tony Cardenas (D-Panorama City) and DreamWorks SKG
executive Wendy Greuel of Van Nuys announced their positions shortly
after the mayor confirmed he does not want a second term for Parks.</LD>
<LD>   "I [have] talked to people in the district and police officers who
believe there is a lack of leadership at the top," Greuel said. She
said Parks has failed to address an increase in crime and low officer
morale.</LD>
<TE>   Cardenas agreed, saying, "Chief Parks shouldn't be appointed to a
second term based on his record. The morale of his officers is
dismal. He has not taken responsibility that it is something that has
to do with him."</TE>
<TE>   The candidates are locked in a tight race in the March 5 election.
Management of the Los Angeles Police Department figures to remain a
major issue in the campaign.</TE>
<TE>   After finding common ground on Parks, the candidates went back to
attacking each other. Greuel accused Cardenas of improperly using his
position to promote himself in a school flier sent to 400 Sun Valley
parents. The flier praised Cardenas for his role in providing free
jackets to Stonehurst Avenue Elementary School students.</TE>
<TE>   "It seems overtly political," said Julie Buckner, a Greuel
campaign consultant.</TE>
<TE>   "It seems like a Sacramento politician thinks by giving out
jackets he can get their votes."</TE>
<TE>   Cardenas denied the jacket giveaway was meant to boost his
candidacy. He said he has been arranging such gifts--Macy's donated
the jackets--for four years.</TE>
<TE>   "No good deed goes unpunished," Cardenas said.</TE>
<TE>   Stonehurst Principal Donna Wheeler said politics had nothing to do
with the flier, which urged parents to send Cardenas a thank-you
note.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't consider it a big political issue," Wheeler said.</TE>

<HD>Trailer Park Is Home Sweet Home</HD>
<DH>Pacoima: The Starlite has junkyards for neighbors, but its
41 units form a tightknit community. 'It looks ugly, but it's really
nice,' says a resident.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>From the outside, the Starlite Mobile Home Park in Pacoima may not
look like a nice place to live.</LD>
<LD>   The park sits on a stretch of Branford Street lined with
junkyards. Broken sidewalks marked with faded graffiti and a weary
wood fence greet visitors at the Branford Street entrance. There's
not a patch of grass in sight. Across the narrow street, a chain-link
fence topped with barbed wire edges a sprawling dump.</LD>
<LD>   But inside, a different scene emerges. The Starlite is a neatly
kept, tightknit neighborhood of 41 trailers. Along the driveway that
runs the length of the park, children play Frisbee and ride bikes.
Moms clean small concrete yards. Dads wash cars. The aroma of cooking
wafts from open doors and windows.</LD>
<TE>   "It looks ugly, but it's really nice," says Raul Euyoque, 23, a
construction worker who has lived here all his life. He was leaning
against the old brown fence as the Branford traffic sped by.
"Everyone knows each other. This is a place where all the kids can be
out playing and the parents don't have to worry.</TE>
<TE>   "You go to other neighborhoods, and kids can't even ride their
bikes. There are no gang-related kids here. It's a cool trailer
park."</TE>
<TE>   There are 62 mobile home parks scattered around the city of Los
Angeles, 48 of them in the San Fernando Valley. Some are borderline
luxurious, with double-wide trailers, manicured lawns, swimming pools
and recreation rooms. Most are modest. Few are in such bleak,
industrial surroundings as the Starlite.</TE>
<TE>   To some, it is the trailer park's isolation--the junkyards are a
kind of buffer--that is appealing.</TE>
<TE>   Barulio Salazar, 41, used to live here, moved to crowded
neighborhoods elsewhere in the San Fernando Valley, then returned.</TE>
<TE>   "It's better in here than it is outside in the city," said Salazar
as he sat in his Chevrolet Silverado pickup.</TE>
<TE>   "People are nice in here. They're good neighbors. We have some
parties."</TE>
<TE>   Last December, a Pacoima social service agency hosted a holiday
party for Starlite residents.</TE>
<TE>   "It was so sweet; they put on their finest clothes for this lunch
party," says Marianne Haver Hill, executive director of the nonprofit
agency, Meet Each Need With Dignity.</TE>
<TE>   "It's really in a crummy location, but there is a sense of
community, of camaraderie among the people there."</TE>
<TE>   Even some of the customers who shop for used auto parts along
Branford are surprised to see a trailer park amid the wrecking yards.</TE>
<TE>   "Wow, man, people actually live on this block?" asked Mike
Gonzales, who was shopping at International Auto Wrecking next door.
"Living right next to all the junk cars and dogs. Well, at least it's
probably quiet here at night."</TE>
<TE>   The unlikely setting of the 48-year-old trailer park has attracted
the eye of filmmakers</TE>
<TE>   such as Quentin Tarantino, who featured it in "Pulp Fiction."</TE>
<TE>   Other than the occasional break-in at one of the junkyards, there
is little crime on this stretch of Branford, according to the Los
Angeles Police Department's Julian Almarez, the senior lead officer
in the area.</TE>
<TE>   "Everybody gets along with everybody over there," said Almarez,
adding that he did not have one call for service at Starlite in 2001.
"The place is just kind of an eyesore. That's the only thing. It
needs to be cleaned up."</TE>
<TE>   But to many who live here, especially young people, the Starlite
needs nothing.</TE>
<TE>   Ingrid Santillan, a bright-eyed 9-year-old with a flair for drama,
leans against a chain-link fence and waxes on about life in the
Starlite, where the rents range from $350 to $680 a month.</TE>
<TE>   "I've got a lot of years here," say Ingrid, a third-grader,
shaking her head, then breaking into a big smile. "But I have a lot
of friends here, too."</TE>
<TE>   Another 9-year-old, Manuela Andriade, plays a solitary game of
handball against the Starlite's blue rear wall, on which someone has
painted "America" in red. On this cloudless day, she looks about as
happy as a kid can be.</TE>
<TE>   "It's just fine here," says Manuela, whose parents and eight
sisters share a three-bedroom trailer. "No one bothers us, and it's
safe here. And I'm having fun."</TE>
<TE>   There are no vacancies at the Starlite.</TE>

<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>California's already-strained state budget is getting a double dose
of bad news: a new projection Tuesday showing that tax collections
are $600 million to $1.3 billion behind earlier forecasts, and word
from Washington that President Bush proposes cutting the state's
transportation aid by $620 million.</LD>
<LD>   Together, the developments could erase some of the fiscal benefit
of $2 billion in program cuts that lawmakers passed last week and
Gov. Gray Davis signed into law Saturday.</LD>
<LD>   Davis administration officials and financial analysts at the
Capitol were still trying to determine Tuesday what the new figures
mean, and their bottom lines don't yet agree.</LD>
<TE>   The administration said the preliminary January tax collections
were $640 million below earlier estimates. The legislative analyst's
office, reporting partial tax receipts, put the figure at $800
million. And state Controller Kathleen Connell pegged it at $1.3
billion. She reiterated her contention that California could end the
fiscal year with virtually no money and be forced to borrow as much
as $8 billion next year.</TE>
<TE>   "We were surprised," Connell said. "We had hoped to see stronger
January numbers."</TE>
<TE>   The 2003 budget proposed by President Bush earlier this week would
compound the state's problems by slashing federal funding for
California roads and prisons.</TE>
<TE>   The state spending plan Davis unveiled last month for the 2002-03
fiscal year relies on an increase of about $1 billion in federal
money to cover Medi-Cal, security and prison costs, among other
expenses. So far, federal officials have earmarked about $100 million
in bioterrorist preparedness funds for California.</TE>
<TE>   Both Connell and Elizabeth Hill, the state's independent
legislative analyst, believe the Davis administration is being overly
optimistic by anticipating $1 billion.</TE>
<TE>   Davis spent Monday trying to maintain existing federal funding. He
sent Bush a letter asking him to reconsider the $620-million cut in
highway money for California, saying that it would harm the state's
economy and lead to 20,000 layoffs. The proposed cut is due to a dip
in federal gas tax revenue.</TE>
<TE>   Finance Director Tim Gage said in an interview that the cut would
ultimately result in transportation projects being dropped.</TE>
<TE>   "Exactly what time frame, we don't know," Gage said.</TE>
<TE>   "This will certainly cause hurried recalculations on the part of
transportation planners in California and other states," added Tim
Ransdell, executive director of the California Institute for Federal
Policy Research, a think tank that advises the state's congressional
delegation. "The cut is going to hit every state equally. We share
the gains when there are gains and the losses when there are losses."</TE>
<TE>   Bush proposals that could bolster California include increased
defense spending and restoring food stamp eligibility for many legal
immigrants.</TE>

<HD>Trinity Backs Out of Easter Service</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ERIC MALNIC</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Despite having won a bitter dispute with the toss of a coin, the
flamboyant Trinity Broadcast Network is abandoning its plans to
produce and televise this year's Easter sunrise service at the
Hollywood Bowl, an attorney said Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   "They dropped it because of the public outcry," said Gerald
Manpearl, an attorney representing Hollywood Bowl Easter Sunrise
Service Inc., which says its predecessors initiated the annual
service 80 years ago.</LD>
<LD>   "People were outraged," Manpearl said. "The service is part of the
long history of Los Angeles and Hollywood. Trinity has demonstrated
in the past that what they put on isn't a community event, it's for
Trinity."</LD>
<TE>   Elizabeth Hinckley, a spokeswoman for the Los Angeles Philharmonic
Assn., which handles Hollywood Bowl leases for the county, confirmed
that Trinity had dropped out.</TE>
<TE>   She said the veteran Bowl group apparently will now produce this
year's event.</TE>
<TE>   Questions to Trinity were referred to Colby May, an attorney in
Washington.</TE>
<TE>   May's family declined to call him to the phone Tuesday night.</TE>
<TE>   A squabble between the Orange County television ministry and the
Los Angeles civic group had raged for months over rights to produce
this year's service.</TE>
<TE>   Trinity said it had been unfairly excluded from past sunrise
services, but the Los Angeles group said Los Angeles County had
pledged to lease the bowl to the group each Easter for a token
payment of $l.</TE>
<TE>   The group said the agreement was good for 99 years and was
renewable.</TE>
<TE>   But county officials said they could find no records of such an
agreement.</TE>
<TE>   The officials said a lottery was the only fair way to settle the
dispute, and ordered the coin toss.</TE>
<TE>   On Jan. 25, the coin was tossed by William Jacobs, an auditor for
an accounting firm hired by the Philharmonic Assn. Trinity won.</TE>
<TE>   But Hollywood Bowl Easter Sunrise Service vowed to carry on the
fight.</TE>
<TE>   "This is not the end," Norma Foster, president of the group, said
after the coin toss. "We'll battle on behalf of the people of Los
Angeles."</TE>
<TE>   Attorneys for the group vowed to seek an injunction that would
prevent Trinity from taking over. Now, apparently, that court action,
scheduled for today, will not be necessary.</TE>
<TE>   Many have criticized Trinity's glitzy sets, extravagant on-air
personalities and the lifestyles of network founders Paul and Jan
Crouch.</TE>
<TE>   The Crouches drive expensive cars and own several homes, including
a Newport Beach estate reported to be worth $5 million.</TE>
<TE>   According to year 2000 tax documents, Trinity Christian Center of
Santa Ana, which oversees a network of Trinity Broadcasting
organizations and overseas ventures, had $444 million in net assets.</TE>

<HD>County Cuts 44 Jobs in Face of Spending Gap</HD>
<DH>Finances: The vacant positions will be permanently
eliminated this time, officials say. Another 160 could be slashed to
help bridge the $20-million shortfall.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CATHERINE SAILLANT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Ventura County supervisors agreed Tuesday to cut 44 vacant positions
from county government's payroll--and warned that this time the jobs
are gone for good.</LD>
<LD>   The action shaves nearly $4 million from a $20-million shortfall
projected for the county's 2002-03 budget. County Executive Officer
Johnny Johnston called the cuts a "measured step" that will be
followed by others.</LD>
<LD>   Even tougher belt-tightening is expected later this year, he said,
as the county deals with higher payroll costs and declining state
funding.</LD>
<TE>   "There are another 160 positions potentially that have to be
eliminated unless we find more revenue," Johnston told supervisors
and county managers.</TE>
<TE>   Breaking from earlier tradition, supervisors agreed to permanently
delete the vacant positions from the county's $1.1-billion budget.
Department managers have resisted giving up the unfilled positions in
the past because they used the money to cushion agency budgets.</TE>
<TE>   Supervisors have criticized that practice as "phantom" budgeting
and asked Johnston to submit a fiscal plan that reflects the county's
true work force.</TE>
<TE>   The county government currently has about 7,200 employees, making
it one of Ventura County's largest employers.</TE>
<TE>   Johnston said his budget analysts will find additional areas where
costs can be trimmed and distribute those targets to department
managers in coming weeks. The goal is to have a balanced budget by
July 1, when the county begins a new fiscal year.</TE>
<TE>   A lot will depend on what state lawmakers decide to do with
California's budget hole. Gov. Gray Davis and legislators are
grappling with a $12-billion shortfall brought on by the slowing
economy.</TE>
<TE>   "We do have a challenge before us," Johnston said. "We do not
raise our own money. We depend on the state."</TE>
<TE>   Most of the vacant slots will come out of the county's public
safety departments. Of the 44 positions cut, 24 come out of the
probation, sheriff's and district attorney's offices.</TE>
<TE>   Salary Increases Put Pressure on Budgets</TE>
<TE>   At the Probation Agency, which is eliminating 16 jobs, Chief Cal
Remington said he will make do with his remaining staff of 404. But
he warned that work-furlough and juvenile-detention programs could be
cut if further reductions are ordered.</TE>
<TE>   Probation was hit hard because Remington, like other managers, was
asked to absorb the cost of a 7.5% salary increase negotiated this
year for probation officers. Salary and benefit hikes granted to many
of the county's employees this year are a major factor in the
projected shortfall, county leaders say.</TE>
<TE>   Likewise, cuts in Sheriff Bob Brooks' department may be greater
later this year after deputies settle a labor contract. For now,
Brooks is eliminating four deputy positions in the jail, a reduction
that has slowed the transfer of inmates to court appearances.</TE>
<TE>   However, the sheriff was able to increase department revenues by
$400,000 by agreeing to house parolees in Ventura County facilities,
forestalling further cuts.</TE>
<TE>   "This is what we anticipated," Brooks said. "What everyone is
really worried about is what comes next."</TE>

<LD>A U.S. District Court judge sentenced a Simi Valley man Tuesday to 10
years in federal prison for placing ads on the Internet to obtain
child pornography.</LD>
<LD>   Ernest Gonzales, 57, was found guilty last year of publishing an
online advertisement to receive, exchange and distribute child porn.</LD>
<LD>   According to federal authorities, the case marks the first time
federal prosecutors have used the statute about online advertising
for pornography in Ventura or Los Angeles counties.</LD>
<TE>   Gonzales was also convicted of four counts of transporting child
porn. He previously pleaded guilty to possessing child porn.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. District Judge Edward Rafeediev sentenced Gonzales to more
than five years in prison for those offenses, but ordered that the
sentence run concurrently with the 10-year term.</TE>
<TE>   Gonzales was arrested a year ago, after German national police
found his ad online. Investigators forwarded the information to the
U.S. Customs Service, which found hundreds of child pornography items
on Gonzales' home computer.</TE>

<HD>O.C. Fire Volunteers May Get New Role</HD>
<DH>Public safety: Plan would focus 322-member program on
emergency medical response instead of firefighting.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID HALDANE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In what could lead to a major overhaul of a decades-old volunteer
firefighting program, the staff of the Orange County Fire Authority
will recommend to the board today that most volunteers no longer
fight fires and only provide emergency medical service.</LD>
<LD>   Scott Brown, a Fire Authority spokesman, said the board also will
be urged to close two of the county's 62 fire stations.</LD>
<LD>   "The bottom line is that we need to build a program that is more
accessible, more reliable and more sustainable into the future,"
Brown said. "At the end of the day, people in Orange County will be
better served: We're not taking anything away, we're making it
better."</LD>
<TE>   After hearing the recommendations at a workshop this afternoon,
Brown said, the board is expected to take action on them at its March
28 meeting. If the proposals are adopted, he said, "I would
anticipate we would move fairly quickly--as early as April."Though
some volunteers expressed concerns, many said the proposal has merit.</TE>
<TE>   Chad Selk, 31, a volunteer firefighter at Orange's Station 1 for
seven years, said Tuesday that he is "bummed" that the station would
close under the plan and that he would miss fighting fires. "You ask
anyone in the reserve program--that's what they signed up for," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   But he said the change could prove beneficial in the long run. "I
kind of knew it was coming," he said. "I'm more happy than anything
that the department still has a desire for the reserves."</TE>
<TE>   The Fire Authority staff is proposing the change because the
reserve program has been falling short on several counts in recent
years, Brown said. The number of active volunteers, now 322, has been
dwindling at a rate of 25% to 30% annually, and the reservists
respond to only about half of the calls they receive.</TE>
<TE>   "We do have some better response numbers at some stations," Brown
said, "but when you're reviewing a program you have to look at it
overall. And the truth is that we have not relied on the reserves to
be a front-line component for the last couple of years."</TE>
<TE>   He attributed the declines to several demographic changes,
including the fact that people tend to work farther away from their
homes and communities than they once did, making it more difficult
for them to reach fires at a moment's notice.</TE>
<TE>   Also, Brown said, the increasing amount of training required for
urban firefighting makes it difficult for part-timers to keep up
their skills.</TE>
<TE>   "The demands of family and professional life have increased," he
said, "while the demands of the program make it very difficult for
people to contribute their time."</TE>
<TE>   Under the staff's proposal, most of the county's reserve
firefighters would stop fighting fires but would keep providing
emergency medical support, which is about 70% of what they do now.
The only exceptions would be those assigned to stations in Sunset
Beach, Emerald Bay, Villa Park, Silverado Canyon and Modjeska Canyon.
In those areas, Brown said, there is still a need for additional
firefighting personnel.</TE>
<TE>   To prepare for their new assignments, each volunteer would get
about 100 hours of training leading to state certification as an
emergency medical technician. As such, they would be capable of
administering oxygen, controlling bleeding and opening air passages,
performing CPR and defibrillation, and putting on splints.</TE>
<TE>   "They offer the critical linkage in our chain of survival for
those very early moments until the paramedics arrive," Brown said.</TE>
<TE>   The proposal calls for the closure of two stations: No. 12 in
Cypress and No. 1 in Orange. Volunteer crews there would be
reassigned.</TE>
<TE>   A third station--either No. 29 or No. 30, both in Dana
Point--would lose its volunteers, Brown said.</TE>
<TE>   Bob Nied, 55, a reserve firefighter in Irvine, said of the plan:
"It's going to have an effect. We've operated a viable and
well-qualified [fire] engine here for 17 years. Now I'm not sure
where the program's going or what's going to happen."</TE>
<TE>   Colleague Tim Cronin, 57, agreed. "I signed up to part of the fire
service," said Cronin, who has been a volunteer in Irvine for 14
years. But he conceded that "things had to change, and this seems
like the most logical direction."</TE>

<HD>Ryder Pleads Not Guilty to Theft, Drug Charges</HD>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Actress Winona Ryder pleaded not guilty Tuesday to felony charges of
shoplifting $4,760 in merchandise from a Beverly Hills department
store and of possessing a controlled substance. Ryder appeared
briefly in Beverly Hills Superior Court for her arraignment on four
counts: grand theft of personal property, second-degree commercial
burglary, vandalism with more than $400 in damage, and possession of
Oxycodone, a strong pain reliever similar to morphine.</LD>
<LD>   The 30-year-old actress could face up to three years and eight
months in state prison if convicted on the charges.</LD>
<LD>   She remains free on $20,000 bail after Judge Elden S. Fox denied a
prosecutor's request to raise the bail to $30,000.</LD>
<TE>   Ryder was to be arraigned Friday but her attorney, Mark Geragos,
said he sought an earlier hearing because of a scheduling conflict.
Ryder was arrested on Dec. 13 after she allegedly took merchandise
from a Saks Fifth Avenue store. Police said video cameras recorded
her taking the items, removing their antitheft devices and stuffing
them into a large bag. Security officers confronted her outside the
store, searched her bag and found the merchandise and pain
medication, police said.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors with the Los Angeles County district attorney's office
filed charges against Ryder last week.</TE>
<TE>   Geragos said the charges are severe considering the alleged
misconduct. He said his client is innocent and that she has receipts
for the merchandise. Ryder also has prescriptions for the
painkillers, which she was taking because of an arm injury, he said.
Geragos said he doesn't believe Oxycodone was the medication Ryder
had in her purse the day she was arrested. "I'm confident that once
all the facts are out ... that she will be vindicated," he said after
the arraignment.</TE>
<TE>   The judge also granted a request that allows Geragos to appear on
Ryder's behalf at future pretrial hearings.</TE>
<TE>   Geragos is to return to court on March 11, when the judge is
expected to set the date for a preliminary hearing.</TE>
<TE>   Ryder has appeared in numerous films, including "Lost Souls,"
"Girl, Interrupted" and "Reality Bites," and has been nominated twice
for an Academy Award.</TE>

<HD>Probe of Fatal Fire Focuses on Attic</HD>
<DH>Investigation: Officials say the Placentia blaze burned a
long time before it was reported.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRISTINE HANLEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A Placentia house fire that killed a father and his three young sons
started accidentally in the attic and burned for a lengthy period
before it was reported to authorities, an Orange County fire official
said Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   The findings contradict initial reports that the Jan. 28 blaze
began near the living room, then spread with surprising speed as
Donald Ybarra dashed upstairs to try to rescue his boys.</LD>
<LD>   Ybarra, 39, and sons Brandon, 7, Connor, 4, and Jacob, 2, were
found in second-story bedrooms over the garage. The small attic where
the fire started is adjacent to those bedrooms and above the living
room area.</LD>
<TE>   They will be buried today after a Mass at St. Joseph's Catholic
Church in Placentia.</TE>
<TE>   Melodie Ybarra, who fled from her burning home and alerted
neighbors, is staying with her parents in Fullerton as she recovers
from second-degree burns. The cause of the fire has not been
determined, but authorities said Tuesday that they believe the path
originated in the attic, based on the heavy damage to the roof, which
collapsed over the living room and kitchen area.</TE>
<TE>   "That whole area had the heaviest damage," said Capt. Stephen J.
Miller, spokesman for the Orange County Fire Authority.
"Investigators believe there had been a major fire in the attic and
it burned a long time prior to the fire department arriving."</TE>
<TE>   The first engine got to the scene about 9:40 p.m., four or five
minutes after the first 911 call. It was placed by Ted Tipton, a
neighbor across the street, after Melodie Ybarra appeared at his
doorstep, crying for help. Tipton told the fire dispatcher that the
home was "fully engulfed in flames," 911 tapes show.</TE>
<TE>   Firefighters never got a chance to enter the three-bedroom home
because the roof above the living room already was buckling when they
arrived. It collapsed shortly thereafter.</TE>
<TE>   Fire officials and neighbors have said that a smoke detector might
have saved lives. Melodie Ybarra, 36, told investigators that the
family's only working smoke alarm, which was attached to a wall
outside the children's bedrooms, was taken down a few weeks before
the fire because it was broken, and was not replaced.</TE>
<TE>   But Ybarra said in an interview Tuesday that she was not sure if
her husband had fixed the alarm and put it back.</TE>
<TE>   She also expressed surprise that the fire might have started in
the attic, which she said was a small space where nothing was stored.</TE>
<TE>   Ybarra told investigators that she and the children had turned in
for the night, and the last she knew, her husband was watching
television in the living room.</TE>
<TE>   "They can't pinpoint the cause because there's a lot of
information missing," Miller said.</TE>

<HD>Edward Zapanta, 63; Trustee for USC and Neurosurgeon</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MYRNA OLIVER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Dr. Edward Zapanta, Los Angeles neurosurgeon, first Latino member of
the USC Board of Trustees and a founder and fund-raiser for the
school's highly successful Mexican American Alumni Assn., has died.
He was 63.</LD>
<LD>   Zapanta, who had been ill since suffering a stroke last summer,
died Sunday in Pasadena of a malignant brain tumor.</LD>
<LD>   Prominent in business and community circles as well as education,
Zapanta took his seat on the USC board in 1984. The same year, he was
elected to the board of Southern California Edison Co. In 1988, he
joined the board of Times Mirror Co., former parent of The Times, now
owned by Tribune Co., and in 1999 he was elected to the board of East
West Bancorp Inc.</LD>
<TE>   Since 1988, Zapanta had also served on the board of the James
Irvine Foundation, which in November endowed the Edward Zapanta
Scholarship, enabling Latino and other students in economic need to
attend USC's Keck School of Medicine.</TE>
<TE>   The USC Mexican American Alumni Assn., which Zapanta and seven
others founded in 1974, is now considered the largest organization of
its kind in the nation, USC officials said. The group has awarded
more than 5,000 scholarships totaling more than $8.8 million.</TE>
<TE>   Raul Vargas, co-founder and executive director of the group, said
in a statement that when scholarships were not enough, Zapanta would
often send a personal check to keep some struggling Latino medical
student from dropping out of school.</TE>
<TE>   When a check wouldn't do the job, Zapanta would personally give a
student a pep talk as he invited him to tag along on hospital rounds.</TE>
<TE>   "The support and vision of the Zapantas [Edward, his brother
Richard, an orthopedist, and his cousin Al, a businessman] has been
key to our success," Vargas said.</TE>
<TE>   Zapanta, named one of Hispanic Business magazine's 100 most
influential Hispanics in 1997, received the merit award of USC's
general Alumni Assn. in 1988 for his efforts in mentoring young
people.</TE>
<TE>   "If a student is competitive enough to go to USC, we do not want
to deny him that chance to go because of financial need," Zapanta
told The Times in 1984 during one of his forays to East Los Angeles
to counsel Latino students with records of poor grades and truancy.</TE>
<TE>   Although they had no doctors or other professional role models in
their youth, Zapanta and his younger brother had parents who
encouraged their education. Their father, Gregory, worked as an auto
mechanic to fund Edward's undergraduate study at East Los Angeles
Community College and UCLA.</TE>
<TE>   And Zapanta's mother, Adeline, who dropped out of high school
during the Depression, became a special inspiration and adjunct
educator for both her sons. She obtained her high school diploma and,
when the family moved across the street from East Los Angeles
College, she began taking classes there. Eventually she earned a
bachelor's degree from Pepperdine University and a nursing diploma
from Queen of Angels Hospital and worked as a nurse in her younger
son's office.</TE>
<TE>   For her boys, Adeline Zapanta converted her small dining room into
a study hall, painting one wall to serve as a blackboard.</TE>
<TE>   "It was such an important part of life to have their own little
niche where they could sit down and have everything for studying at
their fingertips," she told The Times in 1984. "When it came to
reference books, even if we had to scrimp, they had it."</TE>
<TE>   Zapanta became such a diligent student that his family said during
college years he spent the weekends doing nothing but
studying--stopping one New Year's Day, his birthday, only to have a
piece of the cake his friends brought over.</TE>
<TE>   When he entered what is now USC Keck School of Medicine, Zapanta
was the only Latino in his class. But he said the only real prejudice
he experienced was his own--a factor that made him work throughout
his life to improve Latinos' self-image.</TE>
<TE>   "I felt different, you know, being dark ... ," he told The Times.
"I guess it was my own prejudice because the thought that 'I am not
good enough' had always been a perception that I had.... I never
experienced any prejudice."</TE>
<TE>   When his family could no longer afford Zapanta's medical school
bills, a local Latino doctor named Jorge Hoyos gave him a $5,000
scholarship. The benefactor suggested he "pay it forward" or help
other Latino students in the future.</TE>
<TE>   Zapanta graduated from USC Medicine in 1963 and 25 years later was
named its alumnus of the year. After serving two years as a captain
in the Air Force stationed at Clark Hospital in the Philippines,
Zapanta completed his residency in neurological surgery at County-USC
Medical Center.</TE>
<TE>   In private practice, he founded and served as chairman of the
board and medical director of Universal Medi-Co, Southern California
Physicians Medical Group and then Zapanta Medical Group. Since 1992
he had been senior medical director at HealthCare Partners medical
group.</TE>
<TE>   He was a clinical professor of neurological surgery at the Keck
School and served on its boards of overseers and USC Care Medical
Group Inc.</TE>
<TE>   Zapanta is survived by his wife, Norene Murray Zapanta; four
children, Jennifer McGibbons and Michael, Stacey and Timothy Zapanta,
and his brother, Richard.</TE>
<TE>   A Mass will be celebrated at 10:30 a.m. Friday at St. Philip's
Catholic Church, 151 S. Hill St., Pasadena.</TE>
<TE>   The family has asked that, instead of flowers, memorial donations
be made either to the Edward Zapanta Medical Scholarship Fund, Keck
School of Medicine, USC-MAAA Student Union Building #203, Los
Angeles, CA 90089-4890 or to St. Francis High School, 200 Foothill
Blvd., La Canada-Flintridge, CA 91011.</TE>

<HD>Selig's Plan Didn't Eliminate Teams, Only Fans</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Diane Pucin</AU>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Should be some fun, baseball in Montreal this summer. We might even
be in for a first: A game played with no fans in the stands.</LD>
<LD>   That's something for Expo fans to shoot for. A totally empty
stadium.</LD>
<LD>   It would serve everybody right.</LD>
<TE>   Certainly it would serve Commissioner Bud Selig and baseball's
owners right.</TE>
<TE>   No teams eliminated this year, Selig announced Tuesday, and wasn't
everybody just shocked?</TE>
<TE>   Baseball's feeble attempt to eliminate two major league teams has
been clumsy from the start. Owners never did say exactly which teams
they planned to eliminate, but sources almost immediately pegged
Montreal and Minnesota--the game's two lowest revenue producers--and
Bud and his boys didn't deny it.</TE>
<TE>   But did they not think someone in Minneapolis was going to go to
court and fight? Did Selig forget about that pesky legal document
called a lease? Was he surprised the Twins' landlord didn't want to
give up the income he was to receive this year? So the court says the
Twins have to play in Minnesota this year and finally, after being
contrary to the end and saying that contraction for 2002 could take
place right up until opening day, Selig had to give in.</TE>
<TE>   Since the end of a fabulous World Series, one that raised goose
bumps and blood pressure and renewed a sense of security that our
country could still have big, red, white and blue sporting events,
all the ill-timed and badly conceived contraction plans did was anger
fans.</TE>
<TE>   Again.</TE>
<TE>   Baseball owners seem like big bullies.</TE>
<TE>   Again.</TE>
<TE>   What the fans wanted, hoped for, in the off-season, was a
long-lasting labor agreement so that fans could eagerly anticipate
spring training and not be waiting for a strike.</TE>
<TE>   The fans haven't gotten what they wanted.</TE>
<TE>   Again.</TE>
<TE>   But the off-season hasn't been a total waste for Selig and Co.</TE>
<TE>   There will be contraction. Somebody will go. Some day. Probably
next year.</TE>
<TE>   Maybe it won't be the Twins. There is fear in the Twin Cities, and
it might result in sweeping change. New ownership is being sought
since present owner Carl Pohlad was so willing to sell his franchise
into contraction. And Minnesota politicians are in a frenzy to find
money to help fund a new stadium for the Twins, which is what Selig
and Co. want--a sparkling new place for the games and suite holders.</TE>
<TE>   The owners of the other teams with sparkling new stadiums paid for
by you, taxpaying fans, are tired of going to the down-at-the-heels
Metrodome.</TE>
<TE>   And Selig and Co. have gotten rid of Montreal. Maybe next year or
the year after. But the Expos are gone. The owners have already
approved the sale of the Boston Red Sox to Florida Marlin owner John
Henry. And Henry is negotiating to sell the Marlins to Expo owner
Jeffrey Loria. And the commissioner's office is going to run the
Expos for a year. Got that straight? Bud has owners lined up like
dominoes.</TE>
<TE>   If only there was such a clear-cut plan to work out a new labor
agreement with the players. But there has been no labor progress.
There has been labor regression.</TE>
<TE>   The owners say the players' union has no say in contraction, only
in how players from the contracted teams get dispersed.</TE>
<TE>   No, says the union. The owners' plan to eliminate teams violated
the players' labor contract, which expired Nov. 7 but which still is
in force says the union. Baseball Chief Operating Officer Paul
Beeston said, "I, personally, had hoped the union had an interest in
helping us solve our economic and competitive balance. It is evident
that [the players' union] has no such interest."</TE>
<TE>   Of course, it should come as no surprise that the players aren't
interested in helping solve a problem not of their making, but out of
ownership's greed. The players--and their agents--are, as usual, most
interested in what's in it for them.</TE>
<TE>   It appears Selig and Co. aren't interested in the best thing for
the game either. Do the owners really, truly, want a level
competitive playing field, or do they want newer baseball palaces and
more money for themselves?</TE>
<TE>   Do you smell a strike?</TE>
<TE>   You fans deserve it.</TE>
<TE>   You deserve it because you love the game despite all this stuff.</TE>
<TE>   You love the game and welcomed the unexpected brilliance of
Ichiro. You embraced the magnificent season of Barry Bonds. You bid
farewell to Cal Ripken because you connected with a man who took
pride in going to work each day.</TE>
<TE>   You accept that your favorite player is always going to chase
money and never spend a career in one place. You pay higher and
higher prices for everything--the game, the food, the parking, the TV
broadcasts which appear more and more on pay TV and less and less
often on free TV.</TE>
<TE>   You show your love for the game by flocking to minor league
ballparks and cheering for no-names who hustle out ground balls. You
send e-mail in the off-season proposing trades and being endlessly
hopeful that Fox is going to get it right with the Dodgers this year,
that Disney has changed its mind and wants the Angels to be winners.</TE>
<TE>   You love the game because, after every labor strike, you come
back. It takes longer each time, but then something fantastic
happens. Sammy and McGwire happen. And you can't help yourself.</TE>
<TE>   Baseball might be better with fewer teams. The idea of contraction
isn't necessarily wrong, but the arrogance of running roughshod over
things like leases and contracts is.</TE>
<TE>   Selig and Co. made sure the memories of the 2001 World Series went
away quickly. Let's hope that's all they take away.</TE>

<HD>Barnes Distances Himself</HD>
<DH>College basketball: Blaming himself for last season's Sweet
16 loss, UCLA senior improves his outside shooting.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE HENSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Sometimes a college student is lucky enough to have a gifted
professor who clears the clouds and delivers a profound learning
experience.</LD>
<LD>   For Matt Barnes, the mentor was the distinguished Shane Battier of
Duke University.</LD>
<LD>   The lecture hall was First Union Center in Philadelphia, the class
March Madness 2001. But it felt more like a correspondence course to
the UCLA senior forward. Battier, assigned to guard him, took
residence several area codes away.</LD>
<TE>   "Battier sagged off me and gave my shot no respect," Barnes said.
"It really clogged up our offense. I'd have a shot and pass it up.</TE>
<TE>   "That's why we lost--because I didn't produce when he was
sagging."</TE>
<TE>   Within days of Duke eliminating UCLA from the NCAA tournament's
round of 16, Barnes decided to modernize his approach. He had dialed
long distance in high school, shooting from the perimeter and even
playing some point guard, but three years as a Bruin power forward
left his game as obsolete as a rotary phone.</TE>
<TE>   To have any chance of becoming an impact college player and
piquing the interest of the NBA, there was only one solution: He
learned how to use that fashionable orange hand-held.</TE>
<TE>   "Matt spent the whole summer shooting and ball-handling," Bruin
forward Jason Kapono said. "He was with me for a month straight
during the summer. He worked with my shooting coach and we took
hundreds of shots every day.</TE>
<TE>   "Now he's feeling it. He's done extremely well."</TE>
<TE>   Barnes is shooting 50% and averaging 14.0 points, both career
bests. Every aspect of his offense has improved, none more dramatic
than his shooting from three-point range. He is 24 for 57 (42.1%)
after making 18 of 91 (19.8%) his first three seasons.</TE>
<TE>   It took opponents time to recognize the change. After Barnes made
his only two three-point shots and scored 15 points against Alabama
on Dec. 8, Crimson Tide Coach Mark Gottfried said sarcastically,
"It's a good day for UCLA when Matt Barnes makes threes."</TE>
<TE>   The good days kept coming. Barnes had a five-game tear that began
with a career-high 34 points against USC on Jan. 10. He scored 27 two
days later in a victory over then No. 1-Kansas and followed it with
19 against Arizona State, 20 against Arizona and 20 against Stanford.</TE>
<TE>   Now opposing coaches adopt a different tone.</TE>
<TE>   "Barnes is playing as well as anyone in the conference," Arizona
Coach Lute Olson said. "His game is well-rounded now. He can hurt you
a lot of different ways."</TE>
<TE>   When the hot spell subsided, Barnes displayed maturity by cutting
down on his shots. He scored only two points against Oregon on
Thursday and was judicious two days later at Oregon State, making
four of six shots and his only three-point attempt.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not going to jack threes if they aren't going in," he said.
"Shooting is about finding rhythm, and I'm learning to recognize when
I'm feeling it and when I'm not."</TE>
<TE>   The maturity is evident off the court as well. Barnes, who made
the honor roll in the fall, is easily misunderstood. He wears a
perpetual scowl and monster tattoos, the most prominent on his biceps
displaying the words "Sac Town's Finest" around a hulk-looking
basketball player holding the remains of a ripped-down rim.</TE>
<TE>   He avoids eye contact, yet has become smooth and confident in
front of a camera, the rare player who can discuss his team in
succinct and frank terms without resorting to cliches.</TE>
<TE>   "I have to put on that front because, playing out of position the
whole time, I had to act tough," he said. "I'm not saying I'm not
tough--if somebody gets in my face I'll go right back at him--but I'm
a really mellow person.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm someone you can talk to, hang out with and have an
intelligent conversation with."</TE>
<TE>   He also contradicts the prevailing theory that players don't
improve under Coach Steve Lavin. His shooting percentage, free-throw
percentage and scoring average have risen every season and he leads
the Bruins in assists with 70.</TE>
<TE>   Although Barnes is considered a "tweener,"--too short to be a
forward and not quick enough to be a guard--NBA scouting director
Marty Blake said he will be invited to a pre-draft camp.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not saying he is going to be drafted, but he'll get some
interest," Blake said. "He had to improve his shooting and prove he
can play on the wing, and he's on his way to doing that."</TE>
<TE>   The road hasn't been without bumps that shaped his tough facade
and ingrained a persistent work ethic. Lavin made Barnes a power
forward as a freshman against his wishes and he sat on the bench for
two years daydreaming about transferring or quitting basketball in
favor of football--his best sport in high school.</TE>
<TE>   "He came in as a wing and moved to power forward because we didn't
have many big guys," senior Billy Knight said. "Me and him sat on the
bench and talked about transferring. He could have quit, but he
played through it."</TE>
<TE>   Before Barnes' junior season he was conked in the head with a
metal stool by teammate Rico Hines, and this season he twisted an
ankle and twisted his neck yet missed only one game.</TE>
<TE>   Nothing at UCLA, though, has been nearly as twisted as an
unforgettable incident his senior year at Sacramento Del Campo High.</TE>
<TE>   He confronted a male student a year younger than him who, Barnes
said, had directed racial taunts at his sister, a freshman. The
student made comments to him as well, and the 6-foot-7 Barnes threw
the first punch. He was suspended for two games and several days of
school.</TE>
<TE>   When he returned, predominantly white Del Campo had been
vandalized, with "Die Barnes" and swastikas spray-painted on walls. A
school building was set on fire and the Sacramento County sheriff's
office called the arson a hate crime.</TE>
<TE>   "No one in the administration believed me about what that kid
said," Barnes said. "There was never an apology, nothing from the
school. My friends and some of the staff signed a big sign for me
when I came back, stuff like, 'We love you Matt,' but even at that,
there was a kid who snuck a racial slur on the sign."</TE>
<TE>   No wonder Barnes, whose father is African American and his mother
of Italian descent, is guarded. He looks into the sea of faces at
Pauley Pavilion and can't help but wonder how many harbor racist
beliefs. The thought is fleeting, however.</TE>
<TE>   "I moved past that, but it is always in the back of my mind," he
said. "It shows we haven't come as far as we thought. In every crowd
there are as many people who hate you as like you, and sometimes it
is race-related."</TE>
<TE>   Barnes' persona on the court doesn't elicit warm fuzzies. He talks
smack to opponents, grimaces at officials and is deadly earnest.
Afterward, he loosens enough to become accessible and articulate, and
even smiles once in a while.</TE>
<TE>   In the locker room at Arizona State, a Phoenix television reporter
thrust a microphone in his face and said, "You've been getting 30 and
you were held to 19, was it that Devil defense?"</TE>
<TE>   Barnes allowed himself a laugh at the irony before answering. He
scored 19 or more points only four times in his first three seasons.
Now he had been "held" to 19. That's progress.</TE>
<TE>   "All the work I did in the summer with Jason and playing against
pros, it all rubbed off on me," he said. "I expanded my game and I'm
getting a chance to show it."</TE>
<TE>   Although Barnes is the third-best shooter on the team behind
Kapono and Knight, Lavin loosened the reins this season.</TE>
<TE>   "He's hands-down on my side," Barnes said. "He sees my ability to
make plays, score, rebound and pass."</TE>
<TE>   Allowing him freedom made UCLA a better team. And he is better
able to pursue his ultimate dream, the one lived out by players he
has trained with and solicited advice from--Paul Pierce, Chris Webber
and Magic Johnson.</TE>
<TE>   "The NBA has always been a dream of mine," he said. "My family has
never really had anything, so that's what I'm thinking about when I'm
working out."</TE>
<TE>   College is all about preparing for a career, expanding horizons
and increasing options.</TE>
<TE>   Barnes might play in the pros; he might not. Either way, he's way
ahead.</TE>
<TE>   It took Battier to lay down the most memorable lesson.</TE>
<TE>   "Every day that went through my head," Barnes said. "I vowed I
would make teams pay for not respecting my shot. And never again will
my team lose for that reason. I might miss, but I've worked and
improved enough that I believe the shots will fall."</TE>

<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>Associated Press</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Unable to eliminate teams this season, Bud Selig sounded a familiar
baseball cry Tuesday: Wait 'til next year!</LD>
<LD>   Stung by a streak of legal losses, the commissioner backed down
from folding the Minnesota Twins and Montreal Expos this season but
vowed to shrink the major leagues by 2003.</LD>
<LD>   The Minnesota Supreme Court on Monday refused to hear an appeal to
lift the injunction forcing the Twins to honor their 2002 lease at
the Metrodome.</LD>
<TE>   Owners voted Nov. 6 to eliminate two teams but did not specify
which ones. Their labor negotiators later told the players'
association the Twins and Expos were targeted.</TE>
<TE>   Montreal, which joined the major leagues in 1969, is likely to
exist for only one more season.</TE>
<TE>   The Expos have drawn few fans in recent years and owner Jeffrey
Loria is in the process of selling the franchise to the other teams
for $120 million. Loria also is buying the Florida Marlins from John
Henry for $158.5 million, and deals are likely to be approved by
major league owners next Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   The commissioner will appoint someone to run the Expos.</TE>
<TE>   The attempt to eliminate the Twins could result in government
funding for a new ballpark in Minnesota, which would ensure the
team's long-term survival. Selig could then turn to other candidates
for contraction.</TE>

<LD>The Houston Astros don't want the name "Enron Field" atop their
ballpark.</LD>
<LD>   In a motion filed Tuesday with the New York court overseeing
Enron's bankruptcy, the Astros want the court to force Enron to make
a decision on whether to honor the 30-year, $100-million naming
rights agreement signed in 1999.</LD>
<LD>   Enron, which filed for bankruptcy protection in December, is
refusing to give up the naming rights. So far, Enron has made three
annual payments totaling $10.25 million and is current on its
payments, the Astros said.</LD>

<HD>Brady Is Boston's Favorite Son-in-Law</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Mal Florence</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Dan Shaughnessy in the Boston Globe: "He was on the cover of the
Wheaties box before the Patriots' Super Bowl victory was an hour old.</LD>
<LD>   "He's already emerged as every mother's favorite would-be
son-in-law. The man who never throws the bomb now is the bomb.</LD>
<LD>   "In Boston professional sports there never has been anything like
The Tom Brady Story. We've had our share of Hall of Famers, franchise
players and unwashed phenoms, but Brady takes the cake.</LD>
<TE>   "He also takes the Cadillac Escalade [Super Bowl MVP vehicle], the
trip to the Pro Bowl, and he'll probably take your kid sister to the
prom if you ask him nicely."</TE>
<TE>   Trivia time: Who has the highest scoring average in the NBA
All-Star game?</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Bon appetit: Retired Baltimore Raven defensive tackle Tony
Siragusa was in New Orleans for Super Bowl week, so it's only right
that he dine at Emeril's. When chef Chris Wilson visited his table to
see what he might like, Siragusa was blunt--and crude, according to
the Times-Picayune. "Keep it coming until I puke," Siragusa said,
"then hit me again."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Who are these guys? The past three Super Bowl winners, Norman Chad
points out on America Online, were the Rams with Kurt Warner in his
first year starting as an NFL quarterback, the Ravens with Trent
Dilfer at quarterback in a season in which the team went five
consecutive games without scoring a touchdown, and the Patriots with
Tom Brady in his first year starting in the NFL.</TE>
<TE>   Said Chad: "Geez, you've got to like the Houston Texans' chances
next season."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   More Chad: "An American soldier in Afghanistan proposed marriage
to his girlfriend live on Fox's pregame show.</TE>
<TE>   "I know war zones are tough, but there's no reason to lose your
head."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   How do you know? Milwaukee Buck Coach George Karl, commenting on
NBA All-Star weekend: "It reminds me of a celebration of
extravagance, and the game needs more fundamental direction and
awareness.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a great weekend. It's a lot of fun. But it reminds me of the
decline of Rome."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Wanna try again? Here's another example why sportswriters should
stay away from predictions. John Mullin of the Chicago Tribune,
answering his own question of what chance do the Patriots have (in
the Super Bowl) against one of the best offenses in NFL history.</TE>
<TE>   "Not much. If New England couldn't beat the Rams at home on
grass--wet grass--there isn't much hope for the Patriots as they face
a turf team on turf."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Looking back: On this day in 1970, Earl Monroe of the Baltimore
Bullets set an NBA record for points scored in overtime with 13
against Detroit.</TE>
<TE>   It was broken by Butch Carter of Indiana with 14 against Boston in
1984.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Trivia answer: Michael Jordan, 21.3 points in 11 games.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   And finally: It's reunion time at the NBA All-Star game on Sunday
as Dallas Maverick Coach Don Nelson gets to coach Chris Webber again.</TE>
<TE>   Said Nelson, who was driven out of his job with Golden State and
into a hospital by a Webber-led mutiny: "It's going to be fun to see
my old buddy Chris Webber."</TE>

<HD>REBUILDING BLOCKS</HD>
<DH>The Kids Are Far From All Right in Chicago, Where Turning
Around These Bulls Is Going to Be a Long-Term Project</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARK HEISLER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>PHOENIX</DL>
<LD>I don't think we're in study hall anymore, Toto.</LD>
<LD>   If Tyson Chandler ever forgets he's not a high school All-American
anymore, he has a lot of people to remind him, as in last week's game
here, when his Chicago Misera-Bulls came out of a timeout to find
there was no seat on the bench for the veteran Greg Anthony.</LD>
<LD>   So Anthony ordered Chandler to give up his and sit on the floor,
which Chandler did, like a good rookie.</LD>
<TE>   "Don't talk to him like that!" a fan sitting courtside yelled at
Anthony.</TE>
<TE>   Chandler turned around and grinned.</TE>
<TE>   "Don't mess with our family!" Anthony yelled back.</TE>
<TE>   If family they are, they aren't Ozzie and Harriet, more like a
band of refugees, huddled together for warmth in an unfeeling world.</TE>
<TE>   The Bulls were then on their way to a defeat, dropping their road
record to 1-20. In 31/2 seasons since Michael Jordan retired, Scottie
Pippen was traded and Phil Jackson fled, they have won a total of 55
games while losing 205 and failing to rebuild anything.</TE>
<TE>   Having traded Elton Brand to the Clippers for the Chandler's
skinny seven-foot body and potential, they're back to square one,
Chandler having only last week ascended to the starting lineup after
spending the first three months of his NBA career on the bench, where
they let him sit, next to fellow first-round pick out of high school
Eddy Curry.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, as if to underline the Bulls' misery, their icon,
Jordan, returned with the Washington Wizards, who used to wallow in
the depths, although not quite at the Bulls' level, but now are
playoff contenders.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, Jordan was just in Chicago for his homecoming, an
awkward affair in which the fans gave him a two-minute standing
ovation, there was a controversy about who then ordered the house
lights dimmed, both teams stunk out the gym before the Bulls--who
else?--lost.</TE>
<TE>   Their fans, who once seemed to live for little else, are melting
away. In Years 1 and 2 of the rebuilding project, the Bulls still led
the NBA in attendance; in Year 3 they were No. 2; now they're 11th.
Chicago is back to the way it was, a Bear town again, with the Cubs
second and the Bulls as neglected as in their odoriferous early days,
when they played next door to the stockyards.</TE>
<TE>   On the positive side, the Bulls' strategy just might lead
somewhere ... eventually ... and in the meantime, they're handling
themselves like men.</TE>
<TE>   Center Brad Miller later compared that Wizards game to "a 200-foot
drop." That, he said, was better than their next loss, at Indiana,
which he likened to a mere "180-foot drop."</TE>
<TE>   Then there's their resident Oscar the Grouch, Charles Oakley,
brought back to Chicago, where he started his NBA career, for veteran
leadership.</TE>
<TE>   Laughs too, it turned out.</TE>
<TE>   In Chicago, Oakley has become the most quoted American humorist
since Will Rogers, with lines such as, "What do we have to be
embarrassed about? We're an 8-31 team."</TE>
<TE>   Oakley, who'll be a free agent, also features ringing
denunciations of the organization, such as: "They had the best
players and the best coach and the best team in the world and they
got rid of them while they were still winning. Why? They don't really
care about winning. They just care about making money. And don't talk
about this organization being any family and me keeping stuff within
the family. Family left when they ran Phil Jackson and Michael Jordan
out of here. Family left when they broke up the dynasty before it
stopped winning. You make decisions like that, be man enough to pay
the consequences. The way they're doing things, the Bulls are 10
years away from being any playoff team."</TE>
<TE>   The organization tried having staffers sit in on interviews, but
Oakley would wave them away. "The staffers," noted the Chicago
Tribune's Sam Smith, "not the press."</TE>
<TE>   Having tuned out Coach Tim Floyd until he had little choice but to
resign, the Bulls actually try these days for his successor, Bill
Cartwright, although, lacking scorers, it's still hard going.</TE>
<TE>   No One Said It'd Be Easy, or Possible</TE>
<TE>   "They had a certain kind of arrogance when you walked in, from the
security people to the people in the restaurant turning their nose up
at you when you went to the locker room....</TE>
<TE>   "The [complimentary] tickets they gave you were way up in the
nosebleeds. Everybody gives you a couple tickets down low or in the
middle. Theirs were way up on top.</TE>
<TE>   "But they're down low now."</TE>
<TE>   --The Knicks' Shandon Anderson on the Bulls</TE>
<TE>   What goes around, comes around, however reluctantly.</TE>
<TE>   It was a heady ride, but it's over, and the rebuilding project
owner Jerry Reinsdorf and General Manager Jerry Krause once talked
about with such enthusiasm seems to stretch endlessly before them.</TE>
<TE>   Krause, a defensive, thorny personality with a genius for calling
down fire on his own position, takes the heat, but it was Reinsdorf
who called the shots, primarily for economic reasons, hoping to bring
in free agents such as Kevin Garnett before the leases on the United
Center's luxury suites came up for renewal.</TE>
<TE>   And it was Reinsdorf who further failed to realize that by giving
Krause free rein and keeping everyone else in his place, he was
creating the perception of an organization so player-unfriendly, no
one of note would deign to take $70 million of his money.</TE>
<TE>   Two years into the rebuilding effort, having hoarded enough salary
cap room for two big-ticket free agents, came the humbling summer of
2000, when they couldn't get Tim Duncan or Grant Hill to visit; when
Tracy McGrady came but left for Orlando as soon as the Magic made him
an offer; when Eddie Jones agreed to terms, even dictating quotes for
the news release, until the Charlotte Hornets worked out a
last-minute deal and he opted for Miami, instead; when local papers
reported Tim Thomas would sign, only to see him return to Milwaukee
where he's still a reserve; when aging Glen Rice agreed to terms,
then, with staffers waiting at O'Hare to whisk him to the news
conference, got another offer and flew to New York instead.</TE>
<TE>   Nor would the summer of 2001 be a lot of fun.</TE>
<TE>   With the No. 4 pickin the draft (the Bulls' new specialty,
compiling the worst record but failing to draw the top pick), Krause
traded Brand for rights to the Clippers' No. 2 pick, Chandler.</TE>
<TE>   Now, with Brand looking better than anyone imagined he would with
the Clippers, Krause is pilloried anew by critics asking why he
didn't keep Brand and draft Curry.</TE>
<TE>   The answer is that Chandler was the one that experts such as Jerry
West and Elgin Baylor thought had the best chance to explode to the
upside. Had there been no trade, Baylor was set to happily keep
Chandler.</TE>
<TE>   However, Krause's trade seemed to flip out Floyd, Krause's
protege, who had dutifully taken his lumps for three seasons to the
tune of 45-169, making him the least successful coach in NBA history,
who now longed to compete.</TE>
<TE>   So, in Year 4, Bull fans were treated to the spectacle of Krause's
protege refusing to play Krause's kids, Chandler and Curry, going
(down) with veterans instead, opening with a 70-loss pace that would
have been even worse than Floyd's first three seasons.</TE>
<TE>   Along the way, Floyd had blowups with Ron Artest, who was injured,
for wearing sweats on the bench; with Oakley whenever he said
something, which was almost daily; and with the press for asking why
the kids weren't playing and reporting strains in Floyd's
relationship with Krause, until the overmatched coach could stand it
no more and quit.</TE>
<TE>   His successor is the dignified Cartwright, a hard-working center
in his time, known for his elbows but also, by people who knew him,
for his intelligence and dedication.</TE>
<TE>   These days the Bulls are more like a basketball team than a farce,
at least competing nightly.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Chandler and Curry continue to develop, but,
unfortunately for the Bulls, only one day at a time.</TE>
<TE>   Da Kids</TE>
<TE>   "It's the balloons and all those things they're waving. They
didn't have that in high school."</TE>
<TE>   --Curry, on missing free throws</TE>
<TE>   If all the ills of modern basketball were visited on one child,
you'd have Chandler's life story.</TE>
<TE>   Identified as the Next Big Thing in puberty, he has been a figure
of controversy since eighth grade, when "60 Minutes" did a feature
about him, a smiling, fresh-faced 6-10, 14-year-old, sitting
cross-legged on a basketball court, talking to correspondent Leslie
Stahl.</TE>
<TE>   Chandler remembers it as flattering. Actually, it was about the
funding and corruption of youth programs by shoe companies. In
Chandler's case, it was Nike through its local representative, Pat
Barrett.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, this is how the system works, especially in Southern
California, considered the Wild West of youth basketball. In the
absence of any restraint, legislative or otherwise, on the grown-ups
and the companies, the onus falls on teenagers, who are not only
young but often from impoverished backgrounds, like Chandler.</TE>
<TE>   In later years, the flak would get heavier as Chandler drove to
Dominguez High his senior year in a Cadillac Escalade. Sports
Illustrated did a story on him, but this time Tyson, by then 19 (and
7-01/2, 224), saw where the magazine was going and declined its
interview request.</TE>
<TE>   Now living in the Chicago suburbs in a leased house, with former
Pepperdine player Tommy Lewis, an old Barrett guy, Chandler drives a
brand new Escalade, which he bought.</TE>
<TE>   Best of all, no one cares. He's an actual professional now,
working for money--$1.9 million this season--rather than gifts and
gear.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, now it's no longer a game, but a job.</TE>
<TE>   "The only thing I saw was the glamorous side of it," he sighs,
sprawled on a sofa in the Ritz Carlton Hotel, "just being able to
play against the best players, the traveling--that's all I saw. I
didn't really know how much you've got to put into it....</TE>
<TE>   "Yeah, it's been real tough. All through my high school career
and, you know, going to a team that's down in the dumps right now and
losing a majority of our ballgames, that's a tough thing to deal
with."</TE>
<TE>   Amazingly, although he knew he'd turn pro--there was even talk
he'd come out after his junior year--he says no one warned him about
the down side, the fact he'd be brought along so slowly.</TE>
<TE>   Now, when he calls his friends, Cedric Bozeman, who's at UCLA,
Josh Childress (Stanford) and Jamal Sampson (California), they tell
him he has it made and he tells them how it really is.</TE>
<TE>   "Sometimes they're sarcastic about a situation, like, 'What you
got to worry about?'" Chandler says.</TE>
<TE>   "They're trying to get to where I'm at. Of course, playing college
right now, they're trying to go to the next level and so they're
asking questions and I tell them things that they need to do to
prepare themselves, that, you know, nobody told me about."</TE>
<TE>   That's a lot. High school and AAU coaches may or may not be able
to prepare teens for college, but the NBA is another world.</TE>
<TE>   NBA 7-footers have to play under the basket, or the utility of
their height vanishes. Unfortunately, Chandler has arrived, without
bulk or post moves, having been allowed to float all over the floor
if he wanted to.</TE>
<TE>   But it's way early. Even superstar talents such as Garnett and
Kobe Bryant needed years to settle in.</TE>
<TE>   Cartwright is making the kids earn their minutes. Chandler (14.6
minutes, 51% shooting from the floor) has been moving up, but Curry
(10.6 minutes, 41%) hasn't. However, the coach says both are willing
workers, who are on the floor at 9 for 10 o'clock practices, for
extra work.</TE>
<TE>   It might yet work. It's just that, one way or another, it'll be
years before they know.</TE>
<TE>   In the meantime, Chandler still insists, happily, this was "the
greatest decision in my life, so far."</TE>
<TE>   Of course, Oakley has his own perspective.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a new generation," he says. "It ain't like it was when I
first came in. You had to be on click, on tick, got to know the whole
game to play. Now you don't have to know. They draft you, they're
gonna play you ....</TE>
<TE>   "They [young players] aren't as smart as they used to be in olden
days. They don't know the game and they're not getting taught the
game.</TE>
<TE>   "They got some athletic ability, but, like I said, back in the old
days, athleticism didn't get it. Now it gets it. Dunking, this and
that, energy, it's just a different ballgame."</TE>
<TE>   Ask anyone in Chicago, it's way different.</TE>

the Hoosiers (15-7, 8-2 in the Big Ten) past Iowa, 79-51.</LD>
<LD>   Recker, who transferred from Indiana to Arizona and then to Iowa
in 1999, made his first visit to Assembly Hall since playing for the
Hoosiers and was three of 10 from the field, finishing with eight
points. He was booed every time he touched the ball--even during
warmups.</LD>
<TE>   Recker got his harshest treatment from the Indiana student

<HD>Clippers Will Keep Change</HD>
<DH>Pro basketball: After trailing by 18 points, they turn the
tempo their way and rally to stun Knicks, 112-110.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELLIOTT TEAFORD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>The Clippers put on a wretched display of basketball Tuesday against
the New York Knicks. They couldn't shoot straight, defended poorly
and lumbered around the court as if in a trance.</LD>
<LD>   Then, late in the third quarter, the Clippers awoke with a start.
Suddenly, and quite unexpectedly, they began running and jumping and
shooting and dunking and blocking shots and making life miserable for
the Knicks.</LD>
<LD>   The Clippers, powered by a 24-8 run to start the final period,
rallied for an improbable 112-110 victory over the Knicks before a
disgruntled sellout crowd of 19,763 at Madison Square Garden.</LD>
<TE>   As ever, the Clippers made it difficult (impossible?) to
comprehend how in the wide world of sports they were ever able to
pull out a victory after trailing by 18 points late in the third
quarter.</TE>
<TE>   It's the largest deficit the Clippers have overcome this season,
topping a rally Jan. 23 from 14 points down to beat the Lakers.</TE>
<TE>   This one defied explanation. Perhaps Clipper Coach Alvin Gentry
put it best when he said, "We're a schizophrenic team. I guess it's a
byproduct of being young."</TE>
<TE>   The Clippers are the NBA's youngest team, with an average age of
24.8. They also have proved after 50 games that they are capable of
perhaps the league's widest range of play, traveling the distance
from brutal to brilliant in a nanosecond Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   "The thing about an NBA game is that it's a long, long game,"
Gentry said, trying to explain the unexplainable. "At halftime, we
said we've got to play solid defense and try to chip away and chip
away."</TE>
<TE>   Down by 60-49 by halftime, the Clippers stumbled to a 75-57
deficit after New York's Mark Jackson made a medium-range jump shot
with 4:33 left in the third quarter.</TE>
<TE>   Slowly, but certainly, the Clippers began to rally. By the end of
the third, the deficit was only 82-76.</TE>
<TE>   "We were just trying to get the score down to a workable number
and pick up our defense and start running," Gentry said. "We are not
a half-court team. The Knicks were making us play a half-court game,
which is not our strength."</TE>
<TE>   When the Clippers pushed the pace, the Knicks could not keep up.
After New York's Allan Houston opened the fourth quarter by making
three free throws--en route to 40 points--the Clippers seized
control.</TE>
<TE>   Quentin Richardson scored 13 of his team-high 30 points in the
fourth, hitting on three-point baskets and whirling drives to the
basket after New York played him tighter on the perimeter. He also
grabbed 12 rebounds by game's end.</TE>
<TE>   "There's no better place to play and show up and have a big game,"
Richardson said. "We definitely wanted to come in here and get a win.
This is a very historic place. I am just happy to get a win."</TE>
<TE>   Corey Maggette scored 25 points, making 12 of 17 free throws,
despite playing on a strained left knee that forced him to sit out
games last week against the Atlanta Hawks and San Antonio Spurs.
Maggette had eight points in the fourth quarter.</TE>
<TE>   Elton Brand, playing with a bruised left hip that sidelined him
for Sunday's loss in Boston, added 17 points and 14 rebounds.</TE>
<TE>   Darius Miles supplied the highlight-reel move of the game, an
ankle-snapping crossover dribble against Clarence Weatherspoon
followed by a thunderous dunk that gave the Clippers a 100-90 lead
with 4:51 left.</TE>
<TE>   The Knicks would draw to within 111-110 after Houston's
three-pointer with 4.7 seconds left. But Richardson made one of two
free throws with 3.5 seconds to go and Houston missed a desperation
shot from about 20 feet at the buzzer.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought we reached a stretch there midway through the fourth
quarter where we stagnated," Knick Coach Don Chaney said. "We had
open shots. We didn't take what they gave us. They gave us open
shots, but we put the ball on the floor and drove into high-traffic
areas."</TE>
<TE>   Over the game's final 16:22, the Clippers cranked up their defense
and exploited the deflated Knicks at the other end of the court,
outscoring them by 55-35.</TE>
<TE>   "Offensively, they were just punishing us," Brand said. "They were
getting offensive rebounds and we couldn't stop the pick and roll.
But in the second half, our defense was the story of the game."</TE>

<HD>Galaxy Signs Young Striker</HD>
<DH>Soccer: Ruiz, a feisty 22-year-old Guatemalan, is seen as a
replacement for veteran Hernandez.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GRAHAME L. JONES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Carlos Ruiz, a 22-year-old forward on Guatemala's national team, was
acquired by the Galaxy as a "discovery player" on Tuesday and is
expected to join the team in time for its tour of Chile later this
month.</LD>
<LD>   Ruiz, who had been playing for CSD Municipal in the Guatemalan
league, signed a multiyear contract with Major League Soccer, terms
of which were not revealed.</LD>
<LD>   "We're getting a forward who has international experience," Galaxy
Coach Sigi Schmid said in explaining why he had sought Ruiz. "We're
getting a forward who is young, who is still hungry, who still wants
to achieve more things in soccer. He's not at the apex of his
career."</LD>
<TE>   Ruiz is seen as a replacement for Mexican veteran Luis Hernandez,
who chose not to return to Los Angeles after two seasons with the
Galaxy. Schmid said he believes the Guatemalan striker will fit in
well with the team's attack this season.</TE>
<TE>   "He likes to play in the penalty box," he said. "He's scrappy,
he's a feisty type of forward. We have some other players in [Brian]
Mullen and [Chris] Albright and [Sasha] Victorine and Cobi [Jones]
who are good at moving off the ball and creating openings. He [Ruiz]
is a good fit for the type of forwards we already have."</TE>
<TE>   Unlike Hernandez, who split time between the Galaxy and his
Mexican club team, Ruiz will be with the Galaxy for the entire MLS
season, which opens March 23.</TE>
<TE>   "We're hoping, at the very latest, to have him in Chile when we go
on our 12-day tour [starting Feb. 16]," Schmid said. In Chile, the
Galaxy is expected to play four matches in preparation for the MLS
season.</TE>
<TE>   Ruiz, nicknamed "Pescadito," or "Little Fish," has played 24 games
for Guatemala and scored 12 goals. Guatemala failed to qualify for
the 2002 World Cup, losing a playoff to Costa Rica, 5-2, in Miami in
January 2001 in a game in which Ruiz scored twice.</TE>
<TE>   Ruiz, who joined CSD Municipal as a youth player at 12 and turned
professional at 16, was still in Guatemala and unavailable for
comment Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   To acquire Ruiz, the Galaxy will have to release a player in order
to remain under the MLS salary cap.</TE>
<TE>   "We still have a little bit of time, but we're obviously going to
have to do something," Schmid said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Jones was one of six MLS players who Tuesday were named to the
18-man national team roster for the United States' game against
three-time world champion Italy at Catania, Sicily, on Feb. 13.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to Jones, Coach Bruce Arena selected Jeff Agoos, Chris
Armas, Landon Donovan, Pablo Mastroeni and Josh Wolff from MLS.</TE>
<TE>   The balance of the 18-man squad is made up of European-based
players Gregg Berhalter, Brad Friedel, Frankie Hejduk, Kasey Keller,
Jovan Kirovski, Eddie Lewis, Joe-Max Moore, John O'Brien, David
Regis, Claudio Reyna, Tony Sanneh and Earnie Stewart.</TE>

<LD>   What: "Distant Thunder, When Midgets Were Mighty"</LD>
<LD>   Author: Dick Wallen</LD>
<TE>   Publisher: Racing Classics, PO Box 10561, Glendale, AZ 85318</TE>
<TE>   Price: $125, plus $10 shipping</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   If books were classified by weight, Dick Wallen's thorough history
of the midget car racing craze from 1914 to 1950 would be on
everyone's best seller list. It is nearly 400 pages crammed with more
than 1,000 photographs, original color paintings and detailed
information about the cars that captivated Californians from 1945
through 1950.</TE>
<TE>   Races were held seven nights a week, attracting as many as 65,000
at the Coliseum and Rose Bowl, plus jam-packed Gilmore Stadium. The
track, date, winner, car owner, car number and winner's payoff for
every West Coast race during that period is chronicled.</TE>
<TE>   "In the end, midget racing wore itself out as anything that goes
seven nights a week gets tiresome," said Gordon Betz, one of racing's
leading officials.</TE>
<TE>   The midgets were a training ground for the Indianapolis 500. Many
of the drivers, such as Bill Vukovich, Troy Ruttman, Rodger Ward, Sam
Hanks, Jimmy Bryan and Parnelli Jones, later went on to win at Indy.
But not forgotten were popular favorites such as Herk Hurtubise,
Manny Ayulo, Walt Faulkner, Duke Nalon and the irrepressible Dominic
Distarce.</TE>
<TE>   There is a chapter by Danny Oakes in which he covers his career
from 1933-1975, and there are also segments on the car builders and
equipment suppliers who made Southern California the center of
racing.</TE>
<TE>   Featured, too, is Rajo Jack, who won so many "all black drivers"
races at White Sox Speedway in 1936 that he was accepted into the
big-time races--where he continued to win.</TE>

<HD>Geographically, Ishii Is Closer to Dodgers</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE DiGIOVANNA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Japanese pitcher Kazuhisa Ishii flew from Tokyo to Los Angeles on
Tuesday to meet with his agent, Joe Urbon, who flew from New York to
Los Angeles, an indication that Ishii may be eager to complete a deal
with the Dodgers as Friday's 9 p.m. PST deadline for an agreement
looms.</LD>
<LD>   Urbon said he would fly to Los Angeles only if he felt he was
making significant progress in negotiations, and the sides were still
millions apart on a three-year deal as of Monday. "I just don't see a
reason to come out there," Urbon said Monday night.</LD>
<LD>   But after Urbon and Ishii spoke by telephone Monday night, Ishii
apparently took the initiative to travel to the U.S. Urbon informed
Dodger General Manager Dan Evans on Tuesday afternoon of his plans to
fly to Los Angeles and meet with Ishii on Tuesday night.</LD>
<TE>   As of 10 p.m. Tuesday, Evans had not heard from Urbon. Several
attempts to reach Urbon were unsuccessful. The Dodgers have offered
Ishii a deal worth more than $8 million, but Urbon is seeking a deal
that would guarantee Ishii $17 million.</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers won Ishii's negotiating rights by posting an
$11.26-million bid with the Yakult Swallows, Ishii's Japanese team,
but they will lose those rights unless they sign Ishii by Friday. The
Dodgers won't have to pay Yakult the $11.26 million if they don't
secure the 28-year-old left-hander, who went 12-5 with a 3.40
earned-run average for Yakult last season.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers claimed hard-throwing right-hander Craig House off
waivers from the New York Mets and put him on the 40-man roster.
House, 24, went 2-2 with a 4.45 ERA and six saves in 54 games for
triple-A Colorado Springs last season before being traded from the
Colorado Rockies to the Mets on Jan. 21.</TE>

<KH>COUNTDOWN TO THE WINTER OLYMPICS 2 DAYS</KH>
<HD>IOC Has Slight Problem With the U.S.</HD>
<DH>Olympics: Past minutes of Executive Board show resentment
toward a perceived American arrogance.</DH>
<SE>INSIDE THE IOC: First in a series</SE>
<AU>ALAN ABRAHAMSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SALT LAKE CITY</DL>
<LD>An undercurrent of anti-U.S. sentiment emerges in an unprecedented
review of the confidential minutes of the International Olympic
Committee's Executive Board, a tension that continues to fray the
relationship between the IOC's ruling members and its chief financial
backer--the United States.</LD>
<LD>   The friction was never more pointed than during the months the IOC
was occupied with the Salt Lake City bid scandal, but was also
evident when it came to other issues such as financing,
performance-enhancing drugs or the commercialization of the Games,
according to the records recently reviewed by The Times.</LD>
<LD>   Such resentment has profound implications as four U.S. cities--New
York, San Francisco, Washington and Houston--compete for the 2012
Summer Games. Top U.S. Olympic Committee members concede they are
under pressure to extend U.S. goodwill as the Winter Olympic Games
get underway here Friday.</LD>
<TE>   "I think these Games are very important to the relationship
between the United States Olympic Committee and the balance of the
international Olympic movement," USOC President Sandra Baldwin said.
"I have long felt that we had to put America's best foot forward in
order to enhance any future bid for the Games on our home soil."</TE>
<TE>   The documents reviewed include minutes of dozens of meetings
dating back three decades, offering a unique look at how some of the
sporting world's most powerful figures do business. The Times
compiled the minutes from a variety of sources.In the past, Olympic
observers found veiled slights directed against the U.S. in the
subtleties of day-to-day Olympic business but had no proof to back up
those perceptions. The minutes of closed-door meetings, however,
include heated references to U.S. influence by the Executive Board,
which currently does not include any U.S. representatives and has
traditionally been dominated by Europeans.</TE>
<TE>   When then-IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch begrudgingly set
off to appear before the U.S. Congress--he had been called there to
testify about reform plans in the wake of the bribery scandal
stemming from the bid that brought the Games to Salt Lake
City--members of the Executive Board privately urged him not to
comply.</TE>
<TE>   One member, who advised Samaranch to refuse, accused Congress of
treating Samaranch and the IOC as "servants" and said "such arrogance
was unacceptable."</TE>
<TE>   Another member, Keba Mbaye of Senegal, once a judge on the World
Court in The Hague, registered his opposition by declaring he "did
not see how [the board] could accept a situation where the IOC and
its members were threatened by a country, especially when people from
that country had committed improper and disloyal actions in the Salt
Lake City affair with impunity."</TE>
<TE>   And as Samaranch prepared to depart for the U.S., then-board
member Jacques Rogge of Belgium urged him to take solace in a proverb
from 17th-century French author Jean de la Fontaine: "The spittle of
toads never reaches the light of the stars," according to the
minutes.</TE>
<TE>   Rogge, who succeeded Samaranch as IOC president, insisted those
words were merely colloquial advice to Samaranch to keep his chin
up--not assigning Congress the role of toads.</TE>
<TE>   "I am [a] diplomat and guarded enough not to say stupid things,"
he said in an exclusive interview last week in which he sought to
downplay conflict between the U.S. and the IOC, pointing instead to
what he said is evidence of growing U.S. influence within the IOC.</TE>
<TE>   Of the 372 names on the IOC commission roles, there are a record
29 Americans, he said. The U.S. has played host to the Games more
than any other nation, and usually has a member on the Executive
Board. Jim Easton of Van Nuys is up for election to the board today;
Anita DeFrantz of Los Angeles served for many of the past several
years.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think there can be any criticism of the IOC not
recognizing the unique role of the United States," Rogge said. But he
also allowed, "It would be hypocritical to say it was absolutely a
honeymoon all the time."</TE>
<TE>   It is a basic premise of Olympic politics that Europeans dominate
the membership rolls of the IOC and thus European sensibilities
direct many of its decisions, records show.</TE>
<TE>   It was affirmed last month when Rogge released a list of the IOC's
25 working groups and commissions; 16 of which are headed by
Europeans, including the key panels overseeing marketing and TV
rights as well as the commissions serving as oversight for
preparations for the 2004, 2006 and 2008 Games. Only one of the 25 is
headed by an American--the Women and Sport group, chaired by
DeFrantz.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, though, the $1.1-billion-per-year Olympic
enterprise is heavily indebted to the U.S. Seven of the IOC's 10
leading sponsors are U.S.-based and its chief financial underwriter
is NBC, which is paying $3.5 billion for exclusive rights to televise
the Games in the United States from 2000 through 2008.</TE>
<TE>   The USOC holds such leverage that it--and it alone of the 199
nations in the Olympic movement--gets a special cut of the NBC money,
currently 10% of the amount the network pays for each Games. In Salt
Lake, that amounts to $54.5 million.</TE>
<TE>   According to the minutes, the IOC board has regularly examined the
United States' primary role in financing the Olympic movement and
bitterly criticized the USOC for seeking--and, often, obtaining--a
disproportionately large share of income contributed to the IOC by
U.S.-based corporations.</TE>
<TE>   And there is still lasting bitterness about Congress' decision in
the late 1970s giving the USOC exclusive marketing rights to the
Olympic rings in the United States.</TE>
<TE>   But it was a perception of bullying tactics that inflamed Canadian
IOC member Dick Pound, a Montreal attorney who negotiated many
sponsorship deals on the IOC's behalf. According to the minutes,
Pound said a USOC representative warned the IOC it "should not even
talk to U.S. corporations, as the IOC was [a] competitor in the
marketplace."</TE>
<TE>   Pound said such tactics were "effectively destroying the Olympic
brand in the U.S."</TE>
<TE>   The minutes also show the U.S. accused of being inconsistent in
the fight against athletes' use of illicit performance-enhancing
substances. A number of members and staffers said they believe U.S.
officials have not been forthcoming in disclosing positive drug
tests.</TE>
<TE>   Speaking Monday at the IOC's public session, Pound called on
international track and field officials to expel the U.S. federation
for refusing to disclose names of athletes with positive tests. U.S.
officials have consistently denied any wrongdoing.</TE>
<TE>   For years, friction between the U.S. and the IOC has been a
recurring feature of the Olympic dynamic. Before this week, for
example, the Executive Board had not held a meeting in the United
States since the close of the 1996 Summer Games in Atlanta, which has
been perceived by some U.S. officials as a snub.</TE>
<TE>   Only rarely, however, have such tensions surfaced publicly. USOC
leaders are reluctant to discuss it, because it only adds to
tensions.</TE>
<TE>   DeFrantz, who as a former Executive Board member had unique
insight into the board's attitudes, offered a glimpse last summer,
when she came in last among five candidates to succeed Samaranch. She
accused IOC members of rejecting her because, she said, "I'm an
American woman."</TE>
<TE>   The bid scandal in Salt Lake crystallized anti-U.S. resentments,
particularly when Congress threatened Samaranch with a subpoena if he
did not testify, according to the Executive Board minutes.</TE>
<TE>   The Salt Lake scandal centered on revelations that bidders in Salt
Lake had showered IOC members or their relatives with more than $1
million in cash, gifts and other inducements. Ten IOC members
resigned or were expelled.</TE>
<TE>   Further exacerbating tensions at the height of the scandal, the
USOC commissioned its own inquiry into what would be called a
"culture of improper gift giving" and suggested a series of reforms.</TE>
<TE>   Shortly thereafter, Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) sought Samaranch's
testimony in the spring of 1999, and sent him a letter asking him to
address allegations "that a culture of corruption pervades the IOC."
Later in the year, Rep. Fred Upton (R-Mich.) demanded Samaranch's
appearance in Washington, this time before a House committee.</TE>
<TE>   At the next IOC board meeting, in May, Prince Alexandre de Merode,
a longtime Belgian member, declared that McCain's letter was
"extremely arrogant," the minutes show. And, he said, "The IOC did
not have to justify itself to the United States."</TE>
<TE>   Rogge told the board Samaranch ought not testify voluntarily
"under any circumstances." He said, "Despite good preparation and
support, this would be bad PR and it would be an ambush by the USA."</TE>
<TE>   Japan's Chiharu Igaya found it "difficult" to understand "the
attitude of the American government."</TE>
<TE>   China's He Zhenliang registered the fiercest opposition.</TE>
<TE>   He did not wish, the minutes indicate, to "comment on [Upton's]
knowledge about the contemporary world, nor pass judgment on his IQ.
But what [He] could not accept was the manner in which [Congress] was
treating the IOC, a supranational organization, namely as if they
were servants in his house. Such arrogance was unacceptable,"
according to the minutes.</TE>
<TE>   And if American sponsors threatened to withdraw support, so be it,
He said. "The Olympic Games would be sure to continue, with or
without American dollars."</TE>
<TE>   Samaranch appeared before Congress in December 1999, but it was
hardly an ambush. Although there were calls for his resignation,
mostly he played the role of international statesman, explaining what
steps the IOC was taking to prevent another scandal.</TE>
<TE>   USOC members are trying to foster better relations this month in
Salt Lake City, said Baldwin, who said she nonetheless is "well aware
it will take more than just my personal effort to eradicate feelings
from the past."</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. shares some of the blame for rough relations within the
Olympic movement for acting without regard to others, said Bob
Ctvrtlik of Newport Beach, one of four Americans of the 121-member
IOC.</TE>
<TE>   "When we demand financial percentages of the revenue, which are
defensible, we need to make the case to the rest of the world why
we're doing this, and why it's appropriate," the former volleyball
player said. "Once we do that, it seems like the barriers break
down... "If you look at it, just step back for a sec, it's in the
IOC's best interests and the USOC's best interests to have a good
relationship. But like any relationship it takes a little nurturing."</TE>

<LD>Angel pitcher Ramon Ortiz shouldn't have trouble re-entering the U.S.
to play baseball this season even though he has been denied a visa
based on false documentation, immigration officials said Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   Luis Ducasse, director of sports for the Dominican consulate in
New York, said Ortiz simply needs to get a passport that reflects his
correct birth date.</LD>
<LD>   Ortiz was denied a visa by the U.S. consulate in Santo Domingo
last week because his passport birth date did not match his birth
certificate.</LD>
<TE>   It was then revealed that Ortiz is actually three years older than
he had been telling the Angels.</TE>
<TE>   Ortiz actually will turn 29 on March 23.</TE>
<TE>   "We look at this as a harmless story," Angel General Manager Bill
Stoneman said Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   "This is an issue that has come up with ballplayers all the time
and I'm sure Ramon's not alone. My guess is that there are others
too."</TE>
<TE>   Ducasse said such instances were "very common," adding, "It's not
only with baseball players. [Ortiz] shouldn't have any problems."</TE>
<TE>   At the U.S. consulate in the Dominican Republic, an official who
declined to give her name would not comment specifically on Ortiz's
case but said that a person in a similar circumstance must only fix
the date on the passport to resolve the visa issue.</TE>
<TE>   Stoneman reiterated that he expects Ortiz to report on time to
spring training on Feb. 15 in Tempe, Ariz.</TE>

<HD>Angels Show Percival Respect</HD>
<DH>Baseball: Closer, who felt slighted by club in October,
signs two-year contract extension worth $16 million.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE DiGIOVANNA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Angel closer Troy Percival, who said in October he had "no desire to
remain with an organization that doesn't respect me," signed a
two-year, $16-million contract extension with that organization
Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   The deal ties Percival to the Angels through 2004, but it also
gives Percival some flexibility: The Angels hoped to sign Percival to
a three-year extension; Percival, who was signed for $5.25 million in
2002, opted for only two years.</LD>
<LD>   Most players demand no-trade clauses or significant no-trade
protection; Percival opted for a clause that allows the Angels to
trade him to all but four teams. According to a source, those teams
are the New York Mets and Yankees, the Toronto Blue Jays and the
Montreal Expos.</LD>
<TE>   "It's the first time in my 13-year career I had a player tell me
to take years off the table," said Paul Cohen, Percival's agent.
"Troy likes the Angels with the additions they've made, but he didn't
want to be obligated beyond 2004 in case [the Walt Disney Co.] sells
the team and breaks it up. And he didn't want to eliminate the team's
ability to move his contract [if they wanted to trade him]."</TE>
<TE>   Percival, who re-established himself as one of baseball's top
closers in 2001 after an injury-plagued 2000, blasted the Angels at
the end of last season for leaking confidential contract talks to
reporters. Percival was also concerned, after his name came up in
trade rumors in July, with the direction of the franchise.</TE>
<TE>   "Every time they decide to trade one of their [prospective] free
agents they paint him in a negative light in the papers," Percival,
32, said at the time. "What they're doing with me now sends an
unmistakable message about the direction they're going. They're
getting ready to get rid of some of their core players, and I won't
be put under the gun this way. I want to pitch for a team that wants
to win."</TE>
<TE>   Percival, who went 4-2 with a 2.65 earned-run average and 39 saves
in 42 opportunities last season, almost got his wish in December. He
was nearly traded to the Dodgers for reliever Matt Herges, center
fielder Marquis Grissom and outfield prospect Chin-Feng Chen, but
Angel upper management nixed the deal.</TE>
<TE>   Then Angel President Tony Tavares, the executive accused of
leaking details of Percival's contract talks, resigned in January,
and the Angels acquired veteran pitchers Kevin Appier and Aaron Sele,
and designated hitter Brad Fullmer through trades or free agency.</TE>
<TE>   Percival, convinced the Angels were more committed to winning and
pleased with Tavares' departure, softened his stance toward the
Angels and warmed to the idea of remaining in Anaheim.</TE>
<TE>   "Yes, we were approached by clubs that wanted Percy, but if I
wanted to trade him, I would have," Angel General Manager Bill
Stoneman said. "I was as frustrated as our players were at the end of
last season, and there was a temptation to blow it up and start over.
But Percy had a very good year, and we always wanted to sign him.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't know what our chances were, but people's opinions,
attitudes and thoughts change over time. We were patient, we hung in
there, and we were happy to get the opportunity to extend his
contract. It's a good feeling."</TE>
<TE>   Kind of like the one Angel Manager Mike Scioscia has when his team
has a lead going into the ninth inning.</TE>
<TE>   Percival, whose extension consists of a $1-million signing bonus
and $7.5-million salaries in 2003 and 2004, was dominant last season,
striking out 71 and walking 18 in 57 2/3 innings.</TE>
<TE>   He gave up only three home runs. The seven-year veteran has a
23-29 career record and 3.09 ERA, and he is the Angels' all-time
saves leader with 210.</TE>
<TE>   "If your team is good enough to have the lead going into the ninth
inning, you like to have someone like Troy to turn the ball over to,"
Stoneman said. "He's big. When he enters the game, it's game over
almost 100% of the time."</TE>

<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>I couldn't pass on the chance while I was back here to see Michael
perform and do the amazing unbelievable things he has been doing, and
you know how he likes playing in Madison Square Garden.</LD>
<LD>   I arrived early, joined the visiting team at the Plaza Hotel
before they boarded the team bus, and watched with fascination as a
crowd gathered outside trying to get his autograph--a security guard
doing his best to keep the admirers back.</LD>
<LD>   I was a little surprised no one was chanting, "Michael, Michael,"
but I guess that was just out of respect. But as you would expect,
the media horde descended on Michael as soon as he arrived at the
Garden, and so I waited patiently for my turn to talk to Michael
Olowokandi.</LD>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I REPEAT, I waited patiently for my turn to talk with Michael
Olowokandi, and I swear to you, I'm feeling just fine. I've come all
the way to New York, and all I'm hearing is Michael this, and Michael
that--a New York newspaper even suggesting the Knicks should consider
making a run at Olowokandi when he becomes a free agent--and so I
really am waiting for an audience with "Michael.''</TE>
<TE>   "Has anyone suggested you submit to a DNA test?" I said when I got
my chance. "I'm sorry, sir, but you are not the Michael Olowokandi
the folks in L.A. know so well."</TE>
<TE>   I got this puzzled look in return, which should have been the dead
give-away I was talking to Olowokandi, but recent statistics suggest
we might have one of those "Heaven Can Wait" scenarios taking place.</TE>
<TE>   I tried calling him "Joe Pendleton," to see if I was really on to
something, but right away he tells me he's the same old Michael
Olowokandi he has always been, like the Big Stiff we know has ever
averaged 19.6 points and 10.6 rebounds during any five-game stretch?</TE>
<TE>   You could take the other team off the court and the Michael
Olowokandi we know would get in foul trouble. In most games, it's
touch and go whether he will have more points or more fouls by
halftime.</TE>
<TE>   But twice on this trip, Joe Pendleton has scored 27 points in a
game.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I WOULD think it would be tough for anyone to be overshadowed by
the NHL All-Star festivities, but the most consistent play of
Olowokandi's career has probably gone unnoticed with hockey, the
Super Bowl and the Winter Games dominating sports recently, and the
Clippers on an East Coast trip.</TE>
<TE>   So we can only go on what we know and what we have seen--the Big
Stiff playing in 82 games a year ago, and only 10 times managing to
get double figures in points and rebounds in the same game. Joe
Pendleton, meanwhile, has done that 10 times in the past 19
games--after having two double-doubles in the first 30.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know if I have ever seen the light go on and a player
change so quickly as I've seen with Michael,'' Clipper Coach Alvin
Gentry said. "You look at the numbers he's putting up, and other than
the elite-elite like Duncan and Shaq at that position, no one is
doing that.''</TE>
<TE>   Wait until Tim Duncan and Shaq learn they've been mentioned in the
same sentence as the Big Stiff.</TE>
<TE>   "You should have seen it--he had a dunk on the baseline in Boston
that was just amazing," said a Clipper official, and I would think if
the Olowokandi I know had a dunk against Boston, it would be amazing.</TE>
<TE>   "None of the criticism means a thing to me--nothing anyone says
about me can bother me," said Olowokandi, so I tried to meet the
challenge before the game in the Clippers' locker room.</TE>
<TE>   I called him names, and he smiled. I'm pretty good at this, I told
him, and he said he doesn't think the first three years of his career
have been anywhere near the waste everyone else does. I said picture
F.P. Santangelo dribbling, and he didn't even blink. I told him if
the Clippers were really sold on him as their center of the future,
they could have already signed him to a long-term contract.</TE>
<TE>   "We're talking about the Clippers," he said, and I never said he
isn't smart. "I'll look [owner Donald Sterling] in the face and tell
him if he doesn't want to give me a long-term contract, that's fine,
but there's a price to be paid for that."</TE>
<TE>   I know what you are thinking--maybe the Clippers should pay him to
go away, but that's the Olowokandi you and I know so well, and not
the one who has kept this team in the race for the playoffs recently
with Lamar Odom sidelined and Elton Brand handicapped because of a
sore hip. They say this is a different guy.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   SO I was sitting at court-side just down the row from Gary
Sheffield, Magic Johnson and Star Jones to watch Michael play the
Knicks, and it was just a great game, a thriller to the very end with
Darius Miles and Quentin Richardson putting on a show--the Clippers
winning by two points to climb to .500 again.</TE>
<TE>   And let me tell you, the Clippers would not have won this game had
the Michael-we-know-so-well not scored his two points during his
26-minute stint on the court. In fact, at the end of the game, I'm
not sure anyone on the bench was rooting any harder for the Clippers
than the Big Stiff.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   OLOWAKANDI MADE one of seven shots, had four rebounds, two
personal fouls and two turnovers.</TE>
<TE>   "Even the good ones have an off night," said a Clipper official.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   TODAY'S LAST word comes in an e-mail from Joanne:</TE>
<TE>   "You continue to write 'Plaschke and myself.' The correct way to
really write it is, 'Plaschke and me.' "</TE>
<TE>   Why should be it be "Plaschke and you?"</TE>

<HD>UCLA Gets Volleyball Rematch With Pepperdine</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Staff Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>UCLA will get its first chance to avenge an early-season loss to
Pepperdine when it plays host to the Waves on Thursday night in a
Mountain Pacific Sports Federation men's volleyball match.</LD>
<LD>   The top-ranked Bruins have won seven in a row since the three-game
loss to Pepperdine on Jan. 12 in the UC Irvine Wyndham Hotels
Classic. The teams figure to meet at least two more times this
season, with one matchup March 30 at Pepperdine and another likely
meeting in the MPSF tournament.</LD>
<LD>   UCLA Coach Al Scates is impressed with the Waves, ranked fourth by
Volleyball Magazine.</LD>
<TE>   "They are a good passing team and a good serving team," Scates
said. "I thought they served extremely well when they beat us. When
you have six jump servers and they're all on in the same match, it's
tough to beat any team."</TE>
<TE>   UCLA also plays host to USC on Saturday in the 25th annual Kilgour
Cup, named in honor of the former Bruin great whose spinal cord
injury left him a paraplegic. Kirk Kilgour has been in failing health
in the last few months and is in critical condition at Swedish
Hospital in Denver.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Curtis Slaughter is a starter once again, only this time it is for
the Cal State Northridge men's basketball team and not Loyola
Marymount's. As far as situations go, the two couldn't be more
different.</TE>
<TE>   As a sophomore at Loyola, he played on a 2-26 team that was
perhaps the worst in school history. He started all but two games and
averaged 10.2 points. Months later, he was academically ineligible.</TE>
<TE>   After sitting out a season because of his transfer, Slaughter is
beginning to show the kind of talent that made him an All-City
Section player at Washington High.</TE>
<TE>   The 6-foot-7 junior forward has been a key to the Matadors' surge
to third place in the Big West Conference.</TE>
<TE>   Since joining the starting lineup on Jan. 2 against San Diego,
Slaughter has scored in double figures in all nine games. For a team
that needed a reliable scoring option other than point guard Markus
Carr, Slaughter is just that.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Pepperdine ran its winning streak to 10 games with two victories
over Loyola Marymount last week. The Waves also remained undefeated
in the West Coast Conference and sit one game ahead of Gonzaga, which
moved up to ninth in the top 25 rankings.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Cal State Fullerton lost its baseball opener and suffered its
worst loss in history the following day, but the Titans won the final
game of a three-game series at top-ranked Stanford on Sunday to avoid
what would have been only the second series sweep in George Horton's
six seasons as coach.</TE>
<TE>   "We survived the weekend--that's the best way to put that," Horton
said.</TE>
<TE>   Stanford beat the No. 15 Titans, 7-4, on Friday then walloped
Fullerton, 17-1, the next day. Fullerton had twice lost by 14 runs in
its 27-year Division I history, most recently last season in a 15-1
defeat at Cal State Northridge. Fullerton sophomore Darric Merrell
pitched 5 1/3innings on Sunday in the 6-3 victory that improved his
road record to 6-0.</TE>
<TE>   Fullerton plays host to Fresno State in a three-game series
beginning Friday. This is the final season for longtime Fresno State
Coach Bob Bennett.</TE>
<TE>   Horton and Cal State Northridge Coach Mike Batesole are rumored to
be in the potential pool of candidates to succeed him. Horton said he
has not applied for the job, but would not turn a deaf ear if
approached.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   USC's baseball team, ranked No. 3, opens its season Friday with a
three-game series at Long Beach State.</TE>
<TE>   The Trojans are playing 22 consecutive road games as Dedeaux Field
undergoes renovation. Junior right-hander Anthony Reyes, a potential
first-round draft pick expected to be the Trojans' ace, will not
pitch this weekend because of a sore right elbow.</TE>
<TE>   On Sunday, Long Beach will retire the jersey of former coach Dave
Snow, who retired after last season with a record of 510-291-4 in 13
seasons with the 49ers.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   EVENTS TO WATCH</TE>
<TE>   * Men's basketball, Utah State at UC Irvine, 7 p.m., Saturday:
Providing both teams win on Thursday, this game will be for first
place in the Big West Conference. Jerry Green gave Irvine a 67-66
victory with his jump shot at the buzzer at Logan, Utah, on Jan. 10.</TE>
<TE>   * Men's tennis, USC, Pepperdine and UCLA at National Team Indoor
Championships, Louisville, Ky., Thursday-Sunday: UCLA is coming off a
7-0 victory over rival USC. The Bruins are the defending Team Indoor
titlists. Other top squads include defending NCAA champion Georgia,
Stanford, Tennessee and Southern Methodist.</TE>
<TE>   * Men's volleyball, Pepperdine at UCLA, 7 p.m., Thursday: Both
teams are rolling as they come into this key Mountain Pacific Sports
Federation match. UCLA and Pepperdine have each won seven in a row.</TE>
<TE>   * Baseball, USC at Long Beach State, Blair Field, 6 p.m., Friday,
1 p.m., Saturday; 1 p.m., Sunday: The Trojans begin the season ranked
fourth by Collegiate Baseball. USC has an improved lineup featuring
junior catcher Alberto Concepcion, senior first baseman Bill Peavey
and senior outfielder Brian Barre. Long Beach is picked to finish
second in the Big West Conference this season.</TE>

<HD>Sweep by USC No Slam Dunk</HD>
<DH>College basketball: Trojans haven't won the season series
from Bruins since 1992.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PAUL GUTIERREZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When Harold Miner dribbled the basketball between his legs at the top
of key, juked past two UCLA players, drove the lane and threw down
the nastiest tomahawk dunk this side of Dominique Wilkins, the
highlight reel play punctuated USC's 83-79 victory at the Sports
Arena on Feb. 27, 1992.</LD>
<LD>   It also gave the Trojans a season sweep of the Bruins, a feat USC
has not matched since ... the first Bush administration.</LD>
<LD>   David Bluthenthal and Brandon Granville were in Los Angeles-area
elementary schools then, and while the seniors have a shot tonight at
leading the Trojans to their first sweep of the Bruins in 10 years,
neither recalls the dunk or the game.</LD>
<TE>   "Not at all," said Bluthenthal, who was 11 years old and enrolled
at a Brentwood magnet school at the time.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't really start following college basketball until I got to
high school."</TE>
<TE>   That's also when Bluthenthal's soon-to-be-dashed dreams of donning
a UCLA uniform began to form.</TE>
<TE>   Granville, meanwhile, was a 12-year-old sixth-grader at Frank D.
Parent elementary school in Inglewood, Miner's hometown.</TE>
<TE>   "Nah, I don't remember anything about that game," Granville said.
"Nothing at all."</TE>
<TE>   So, if neither can remember the past, can they even dream of
repeating it?</TE>
<TE>   If the 25th-ranked Trojans dominate the boards and press and
harass No. 15 UCLA's ball handlers they way they did  Jan. 10 at the
Forum in an 81-77 victory, then the answer is a resounding yes.</TE>
<TE>   But if USC allows the Pauley Pavilion ghosts to spook them again
and the 11 national championship banners hanging in the rafters to
blur their vision, then the cross-town bus ride home will be an
arduous journey.</TE>
<TE>   USC Coach Henry Bibby, who won three national titles playing at
UCLA from 1970-72, is 2-9 against his alma mater, 0-5 in Westwood.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a problem for every team that goes to Pauley, not just our
team or certain players," he said.  "I think the mystique of playing
over there has hindered a lot of people from being successful. But
we're going to change that. We're going to change that [today] and
hopefully everybody is on top of their game to play."</TE>
<TE>   Since sweeping the Bruins in 1992 and finishing 24-6 with a No. 8
national ranking, the Trojans had gone  3-15 against UCLA. Then came
Jan. 10.</TE>
<TE>   The Trojans outrebounded UCLA, 46-33, and grabbed 24 offensive
rebounds. USC also used  its full-court press to get six steals and
create 14 Bruin turnovers.</TE>
<TE>   Only a career game from UCLA senior forward Matt Barnes, who had
34 points and seven three-point baskets, kept USC from running away.</TE>
<TE>   "Now we know that he can shoot a little bit," USC power forward
Sam Clancy said.</TE>
<TE>   "We have to make him more of a driver, not let him shoot wide-open
shots."</TE>
<TE>   USC, which is coming off a last-minute 73-69 loss at first-place
Oregon, is 16-5 overall, 8-3 in the Pacific 10 Conference, tied for
second with Arizona. UCLA is 15-6, 7-4 and in fourth place.</TE>
<TE>   "We have a chance to put [UCLA] away for the Pac-10 championship,"
Clancy added, "and put ourselves in a better position to win it."</TE>
<TE>   Maybe that's why no basketball players around Heritage Hall can
remember the last time USC swept UCLA: The Trojans are too busy
concentrating on  winning their first Pac-10 championship since 1985,
when they shared the title with Washington.</TE>
<TE>   "Really, sweeping UCLA would be nice but it's just as big a deal
for our team to stay in the race," said Bluthenthal, who had 16
points and 18 rebounds against the Bruins four weeks ago. "The extra
motivation is to get an upper leg on the race."</TE>
<TE>   Even if there are no jaw-dropping, jump-up-out-of-your-seat slam
dunks.</TE>

<LD>If and when UCLA fans and boosters begin their annual spring ritual
of calling for Bruin Coach Steve Lavin's head, Lavin has a supporter
in an unlikely place.</LD>
<LD>   "I think Steve Lavin has done an excellent job," USC Coach Henry
Bibby said. "People talk about Steve and he's had a lot of 20-plus
seasons of winning basketball. I'll take his record, I'd be very
happy to.</LD>
<LD>   "There are people over there [at UCLA], I think they're getting
greedy at times, think they should win a national championship [with
regularity]. He gets his teams ready to play. You can't win every
game ... but I think he gets his team up to play for games that they
need to get up to play. And that's a good sign."</LD>
<TE>   Another good sign for Lavin: He's 9-2 against Bibby.</TE>
<TE>   Bibby has not heard from the Pacific 10 Conference regarding his
complaints Saturday on the Oregon fans' derisive chants of "Deadbeat
dad" and "Your son hates you," in reference to his strained
relationship with his son, Sacramento King guard Mike Bibby.</TE>
<TE>   "Why would they contact me about that?" the elder Bibby said.
"It's been going on for six years and no one's contacted me about it,
so I don't assume they're going to do that now."</TE>

<HD>It Was End of an Error</HD>
<DH>Women's sports: Sheila Weaver had no chance to showcase
talents, but because of Title IX, daughter Cheryl did.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBYN NORWOOD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Cheryl Weaver's mother has the genes.</LD>
<LD>   Whether she had the game is lost to history.</LD>
<LD>   "In college, I was on the pompom squad," Sheila Weaver said.</LD>
<TE>   Her daughter is a three-time All-American, a powerful 6-foot-2
volleyball player whose Long Beach State team was 33-0 before losing
to Stanford in front of 10,000 fans in the NCAA championship match in
December.</TE>
<TE>   Sheila Weaver was watching--as she so often has.</TE>
<TE>   An acclaimed coach, Sheila Weaver has mentored two national high
school volleyball players of the year, three junior national team
players and sent athletes on to Stanford, Long Beach, California and
Duke, to name a few.</TE>
<TE>   As a player--zilch.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm 52, so it's prior to Title IX in terms of opportunities,"
Sheila Weaver said.</TE>
<TE>   "I was a good athlete. We'd have races at recess and I'd beat
everybody. But when I went to college, we didn't have any women's
teams."</TE>
<TE>   Decades later, that's difficult to imagine.</TE>
<TE>   As some 1,500 ceremonies across the nation commemorate today's
16th National Girls and Women in Sports Day, this also marks the 30th
anniversary of Title IX--the landmark 1972 federal legislation that
mandated gender-equity in education, spurring opportunities for women
in sports.</TE>
<TE>   Though noncompliance with Title IX remains widespread, the
transformation is unfathomable for those who weren't there in the
beginning.</TE>
<TE>   "I just can't imagine not being able to do what you have a gift
for, not even being able to get a scholarship," said Cheryl Weaver,
born in 1980.</TE>
<TE>   "It's just hard to believe."</TE>
<TE>   In 1972, only one in 27 girls participated in sports. The most
recent study cites one in 21/2.</TE>
<TE>   No one needs to cite a scientific sample if they witnessed the
1996 Atlanta Olympics--the Olympics of Mia Hamm, Lisa Leslie and Dot
Richardson.</TE>
<TE>   But until the daughters of such women as those and other
trailblazers such as Ann Meyers Drysdale--the first woman to receive
an athletic scholarship to UCLA--become athletes in their own right,
there still will be a Title IX generation gap.</TE>
<TE>   Brian Gimmillaro, Weaver's coach at Long Beach State, sees it in
recruiting.</TE>
<TE>   "I go into homes and the moms look at me like, 'Where were you 20
years ago?'" he said.</TE>
<TE>   Sheila Weaver came from an athletic family.</TE>
<TE>   One brother, Bob Florence, went to Nevada Las Vegas and played
basketball for Jerry Tarkanian his senior year in 1974. Another
brother, Bill Florence, played football at Louisville. Both had a
brief flirtation with the pros.</TE>
<TE>   Sheila had no such opportunities, and precious few even at Des
Moines Technical High in Iowa.</TE>
<TE>   "We had pompom teams, drill teams. They had football, track,
basketball," she said. "There was a teacher who was into golf, and
they started a golf team and asked if any girls wanted to play golf,
so I did--not that I had played a whole lot of golf."</TE>
<TE>   At Drake, the pompom squad and intramural sports were the options
for women. So Sheila cheered for the Drake basketball team that went
to the 1969 Final Four and lost to UCLA--though the pompom squad
didn't get to accompany the men to Louisville because of the cost.</TE>
<TE>   Women's teams simply weren't an option.</TE>
<TE>   "I think there was more of an acceptance that that's the way it
was," she said. "There wasn't a whole lot of questioning why it was
different.</TE>
<TE>   "For me, it didn't come down to, 'Let's protest,' nothing like
that. But I think once the law was in place, things changed."</TE>
<TE>   They haven't changed entirely.</TE>
<TE>   Sheila Weaver is still working to see that they do.</TE>
<TE>   After graduating from Drake with a major in physical education in
1971 and earning a master's in the field from Kent, Weaver became a
coach and physical education teacher.</TE>
<TE>   While teaching at the Sidwell Friends School in Washington--best
known as Chelsea Clinton's school during her White House
years--Weaver founded the D.C. Juniors Volleyball Club, a club team
primarily for African American girls from Maryland, Virginia and the
District of Columbia.</TE>
<TE>   "In club volleyball, to see a team of black girls, all 6 feet tall
and from the East Coast, that's unusual," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Cheryl and former Stanford player Paula McNamee were only two of
the many players from that group to go on to earn scholarships. So
did Alisha Weaver, the older daughter of Sheila and Booker Weaver.
(Alisha played at Clark Atlanta University in Georgia.) Other alumni
went on to Duke, Temple, George Washington, Howard and Macalester
College.</TE>
<TE>   In 1995, Sheila Weaver founded a nonprofit organization called the
Academic and Athletic Alliance, a group that aims to help girls from
disadvantaged backgrounds pursue sports and scholarship opportunities
(www.academicandathleticalliance.com).</TE>
<TE>   She's also working on a Web site to link women's college coaches
with prospective recruits.</TE>
<TE>   Two years ago, Sheila Weaver was honored by the Women's Sports
Foundation as the 2000 Private School Coach of the Year for the
District of Columbia.</TE>
<TE>   This year, she is working at the Archer School for Girls in Los
Angeles after leaving Sidwell Friends to watch Cheryl play.</TE>
<TE>   After all, it's something Sheila never experienced.</TE>
<TE>   "She didn't put any pressure on me," said Cheryl, preparing to
join the U.S. national team in training at Colorado Springs, Colo.
"But she said, 'Make the most of your God-given talents and your
opportunities, because I didn't get to.'"</TE>

<LD>In a season where victories have been scarce, UCLA got a needed 77-73
win over Long Beach State Tuesday night before 924 at the Pyramid.</LD>
<LD>   Shalada Allen carried the Bruins (7-15) with a career-high 20
points, making 10 of 14 shots from the field.</LD>
<LD>   "I had no idea I made that many," said Allen, who scored 10 points
in each half. "There were some openings in the middle of their
defense and I just took the shots."</LD>
<TE>   But UCLA, which came in shooting 61% from the free-throw line,
made 12 of 13 foul shots.</TE>
<TE>   The biggest were by Whitney Jones, whose two free throws with 14
seconds left were the final points.</TE>
<TE>   "Hopefully we made some strides tonight," said Bruin Coach Kathy
Olivier, whose team surpassed last season's win total (6). "We had
talked today about doing the little things like rebound and making
free throws. If we shoot free throws like we normally do, we might
lose."</TE>
<TE>   The 49ers slipped to 11-10. Crystal Givens led Long Beach State
with 18 points.</TE>
<TE>   Long Beach State, which fell behind by 10 points in the second
half before a late rally, may have cost themselves a chance to tie or
win the game in the final seconds.</TE>
<TE>   With UCLA leading, 75-71, and 27 seconds to play, Tamara Inoue (14
points) was fouled while shooting a three-point shot. She made her
first two free throws but intentionally missed the third one trying
to catch the Bruins by surprise. But UCLA got the rebound and hung on
to win.</TE>

<HD>Lindh Faces Added Grand Jury Charges</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD A. SERRANO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>A federal grand jury Tuesday indicted John Walker Lindh, leveling
new charges that the young Northern Californian willingly shouldered a
rifle at the behest of Osama bin Laden and was taught at an Al Qaeda
training camp how to kill Americans.</LD>
<LD>   The 10-count indictment significantly expands the government case
filed last month against Lindh, presenting the most detailed view yet of
his alleged involvement with terrorist elements in Afghanistan.
Convictions on all counts could lead to multiple life prison terms
without parole, but none of the charges carries a possible death
sentence.</LD>
<LD>   Atty. Gen. John Ashcroft called Tuesday's indictment a "timeline of
terror" and said Lindh became "an active, knowing participant" in the war
against America.</LD>
<TE>   But that portrait differed sharply from the one drawn by Lindh's
attorneys, who attacked the heart of the federal case against their
client and argued that any self-incriminating statements he may have made
were coerced while "he was in a state of complete exhaustion and shock."</TE>
<TE>   The defense said that, in the days after the scrawny young man was
captured, he was starved, blindfolded, stripped of his clothes, shackled,
restrained with duct tape and held inside a cold metal container that
"had no heat source, lighting or insulation, and Mr. Lindh was covered by
only a single blanket."</TE>
<TE>   The indictment sets aside a preliminary hearing that was scheduled for
today and buys the government time before it must begin turning over
crucial evidence and presenting court testimony in one of the most
intriguing episodes of the war on terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   The two sides are to meet this morning in federal district court in
nearby Alexandria, Va., where Lindh will ask to be released on bail until
his trial.</TE>
<TE>   His father, Frank Lindh, a San Francisco energy lawyer, said he is
prepared to move to the Washington area to provide a home for his son and
will "take responsibility for him as a personal custodian."</TE>
<TE>   The indictment was returned by the federal grand jury in Alexandria,
where terrorist suspect Zacarias Moussaoui was indicted in December in a
separate case. The government says Moussaoui was training in the United
States to join 19 hijackers who commandeered airplanes on Sept. 11 for
attacks on New York and near Washington.</TE>
<TE>   The indictment was announced in Washington by Ashcroft.</TE>
<TE>'The Fact of These Choices Is Clear'</TE>
<TE>   "John Walker Lindh chose to train with Al Qaeda, chose to fight with
the Taliban, chose to be led by Osama bin Laden," the attorney general
said. "The reasons for his choices may never be fully known to us. But
the fact of these choices is clear. Americans who love their country do
not dedicate themselves to killing Americans."</TE>
<TE>   Ashcroft said that if convicted of all charges in the indictment,
Lindh, 20, could receive six 10-year prison sentences and a 30-year
sentence in addition to the multiple life terms--all without parole.</TE>
<TE>   The indictment, however, stops short of accusing Lindh of treason,
which could have brought a death sentence.</TE>
<TE>   In a criminal complaint filed last month, the government filed three
charges against Lindh: conspiring to kill Americans overseas, providing
material support and resources to foreign terrorist networks such as Al
Qaeda, and engaging in prohibited transactions with the Taliban.</TE>
<TE>   Tuesday's indictment included those charges, then went much further.
The grand jury alleged that Lindh was trained by Al Qaeda and that he not
only worked shoulder-to-shoulder with members of the Bin Laden
organization and the Taliban but he also carried and used "firearms and
destructive devices during crimes of violence."</TE>
<TE>   The indictment alleges that:</TE>
<TE>   * Lindh spent several days in a Bin Laden guest house in Kandahar,
Afghanistan, in May or June. Then he joined 20 other trainees at the
nearby Al-Farooq training camp, an Al Qaeda facility.</TE>
<TE>   * At Al-Farooq, Lindh was told "that Bin Laden had sent forth some 50
people to carry out 20 suicide terrorist operations against the United
States and Israel."</TE>
<TE>   * Lindh himself met with a senior Al Qaeda official, Abu Mohammad
Al-Masri, and was asked if he was interested in traveling outside
Afghanistan to conduct operations against the U.S. and Israel. Lindh
declined, saying he preferred "going to the front lines to fight."</TE>
<TE>   * In June or July, "Lindh swore allegiance to jihad."</TE>
<TE>   * By August, after completing his training, Lindh went to Kabul and
was issued an AKM rifle with a barrel suitable for long-range firing. He
carried the rifle to his fighting unit in northern Afghanistan and soon
was hoisting other weapons as well, including an RPK rifle and at least
two grenades.</TE>
<TE>   * He soon learned of the Sept. 11 strikes but remained with his unit
"despite having been told that Bin Laden had ordered the attacks, that
additional terrorist attacks were planned and that additional Al Qaeda
personnel were being sent from the training camps to the front lines to
protect Bin Laden and defend against an anticipated military response
from the United States."</TE>
<TE>No Evidence He Ever Fired, Lawyers Say</TE>
<TE>   In November, Lindh and his unit retreated from their front lines and
were captured by Northern Alliance troops. During a prison uprising,
Lindh was wounded by bullets or shrapnel fire, recaptured and placed in
U.S. custody.</TE>
<TE>   But Lindh's defense team, led by San Francisco attorney James J.
Brosnahan, said in court papers Tuesday that Lindh was mistreated both by
Northern Alliance and U.S. officials and that the statements he allegedly
made to authorities came only after he was threatened.</TE>
<TE>   "There is no evidence that Mr. Lindh made any attempt to engage in
combat with United States military forces, let alone harm any civilian,"
the defense said in arguing for his pretrial release. ". . . There are no
allegations and no evidence that he ever so much as fired a shot, even at
Northern Alliance soldiers."</TE>
<TE>   The defense said Lindh's Northern Alliance captors were led by Gen.
Abdul Rashid Dostum, whom the defense lawyers described as a former
Soviet collaborator "with a reputation for extreme brutality."</TE>
<TE>   After the prison outbreak, Lindh hid in the basement of a fort, where
he had almost no food, limited water and got little sleep, the defense
said. U.S. forces pounded the fort with about 40 missile strikes.
Northern Alliance troops tossed grenades down air vents to the basement,
poured oil or gasoline down the vents and set them afire, and flooded the
basement with freezing water, according to defense papers.</TE>
<TE>   "When Mr. Lindh emerged from the basement on about Dec. 1, he was in a
state of complete exhaustion and shock," the defense said.</TE>
<TE>   He was taken into U.S. custody. A week later, he was allegedly
blindfolded and bound with plastic handcuffs so tight his hands turned
blue, then transferred to the U.S. Marines' Camp Rhino south of Kandahar.
"Soldiers transporting him threatened him with death and torture," the
defense said.</TE>
<TE>   At Camp Rhino, "still blindfolded, completely naked, he was then
placed in a metal shipping container." The container was cold and he was
given just a single blanket, the defense said.</TE>
<TE>   There he remained for several days before he was taken to a tent,
finally willing to talk to U.S. authorities to end his suffering.</TE>
<TE>   Defense lawyers continued to complain that Lindh was denied legal
representation for 54 days. But government prosecutors maintain Lindh
willingly waived his right to a lawyer, both orally and in writing.</TE>
<TE>   Regarding claims of mistreatment, U.S. Atty. Paul McNulty said: "I'm
not in a position to be able to address those kinds of issues today."</TE>

<HD>Cutting Edge of Secrecy</HD>
<DH>'Better shred than read' are the new watchwords of white-collar
America. But inquiring minds are getting better at picking up the pieces.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>J. MICHAEL KENNEDY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Two decades ago, Iranian students who stormed the U.S. embassy in
Tehran found a mountain of paper shredded by American diplomats who were
trying to hastily destroy secret documents. The enterprising students
brought in carpet weavers, who reassembled the papers, strip by
painstaking strip.</LD>
<LD>   The result: volume after volume of classified material, made available
in those days at Tehran bookstores. The reconstituted documents became
collectors' items and added to the growing, and sometimes dubious lore of
paper shredding.</LD>
<LD>   Now, bankrupt energy trader Enron is adding its own chapter. Recent
revelations paint a picture of corporate shredding machines hard at work
even as the company went bust and investigators moved in to examine
hundreds of suspicious partnership deals.</LD>
<TE>   Like the Tehran experience, the shredding may be all for naught.
Modern sleuthing can overcome some of the most devious destruction. Yet
the notoriety of the Enron shredding, like many earlier episodes, is
almost certain to enhance the perception that the only safe secret is a
shredded secret.</TE>
<TE>   In most corporations, the shredder is now as common as water coolers
and filing cabinets. Regularly scheduled shredding sessions can legally
dispose of documents that in the future might be subject to a subpoena.
Whole warehouses of files, and even defective products, have found their
way into gnawing electronic teeth.</TE>
<TE>   The National Assn. for Information Destruction, the industry trade
association, estimates the number of shredding companies nationwide at
around 600, up from perhaps 25 in the early 1980s. Iron Mountain Inc.,
one of the largest records-management companies in the world, estimates
that American businesses spend roughly $300 million a year on shredding
documents.</TE>
<TE>   Increasingly, however, that doesn't mean the data can't be recovered
by investigators. Because most documents are created on computers, then
passed along electronically, shredding paper copies eliminates only one
version.</TE>
<TE>   Sergio Kopelev, an electronic sleuth for Control Risks Inc., an
international business-risk consulting company, said chances are good he
could come up with a destroyed Enron document by examining the company's
computer hard drives. (A computer forensics firm has been hired by the
Andersen accounting firm to do just that.)</TE>
<TE>   "It would be complicated because of the sheer volume of data you'd
have to process," Kopelev said. "But this kind of procedure is routinely
done by computer investigators. I would love to be the one to do it."</TE>
<TE>   Various parties, meanwhile, are trying to sort out what to do with the
thousands of strips of shredded material confiscated in the Enron
investigation. As matters now stand, the shreds are in the hands of the
Milberg Weiss law firm, which represents a former Enron executive who
found them.</TE>
<TE>   The strips of paper have been subpoenaed by the Securities and
Exchange Commission. Neither the SEC nor the Department of Justice would
comment on any plans to reconstruct the documents, though a spokesman for
Milberg Weiss said whole lines of type are clearly visible because the
documents were shredded horizontally--as were the Iran embassy documents
that were reassembled. That embarrassing incident caused American
embassies worldwide to upgrade their shredding machines so they produced
confetti rather than paper strips.</TE>
<TE>   How shredding began is subject to some guesswork. Shredder importer
Jack Preiss says the first commercial patent was issued in 1935, with a
concept borrowed from a Bavarian noodle cutter. Other sources put its
invention earlier, including one story of an Austrian artillery officer
who developed a foot-powered shredder in the late 19th century so he
could destroy his ballistics drawings.</TE>
<TE>   Once merely a tool of institutions such as hospitals that routinely
destroyed records to protect patient privacy, shredding blossomed into a
truly diverse industry after the Watergate burglary in 1972.</TE>
<TE>   G. Gordon Liddy, mastermind of the break-in, shredded as much as he
could find that was connected with the botched burglary, including soap
wrappers and $100 bills from illegal campaign funds. But he couldn't get
rid of everything. Liddy later opined in his autobiography that he could
have used a much bigger shredder.</TE>
<TE>   "The year before Watergate, I sold 70 shredders," said John Wagner of
Allegheny Paper Shredders, who has installed industrial facilities
worldwide. "After Watergate, I sold 400. Everybody's attitude was, 'We've
got to have a shredder.' "</TE>
<TE>   Other infamous and market-building shreddings followed. Former Lt.
Col. Oliver L. North held a shredding party just before Justice
Department investigators began searching his office for evidence in the
Iran-Contra scandal. The Bank of Switzerland shredded Holocaust-era
documents showing that Nazis forced Jews to sell their property far below
its fair value. The Treasury Department fed 162 boxes of American Indian
trust fund documents into its shredders in 1998, even as it was accused
of mismanaging Indian funds.</TE>
<TE>   Lawyers, industry experts say, provided a key boost in shredding's
popularity when they began advising corporate clients that they could
better protect themselves from lawsuits if there were no paper trails.
The theory flew in the face of long-standing business practices, in which
companies routinely warehoused their records for decades.</TE>
<TE>   "It's much more prudent to see how long you need to keep records
statutorially, then get rid of them," said Robert Johnson, head of the
industry association.</TE>
<TE>   More to the point, it's a way for companies to say that document
destruction is business as usual, thereby protecting them from
accusations of shredding incriminating records as investigators are
knocking at the door, a la Enron.</TE>
<TE>   All businesses must, at some point, destroy confidential data, and
"without proper safeguards, information ends up in the dumpster, where it
is readily, and legally, available to anybody," Johnson said.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps the most famous of these "dumpster diver" incidents was the
case involving former Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger, whose
garbage was picked through by National Enquirer reporter Jay Gourley in
1975. Among the juicy tidbits Gourley found were details of Kissinger's
Secret Service protection, shopping lists, and unopened cans of food.
Industry experts say similar dumpster diving is a common form of
industrial espionage.</TE>
<TE>   Wagner, of Allegheny Paper Shredders, said the prevalent attitude
among most companies is to simply shred everything as standard practice.</TE>
<TE>   "Then they're safe," he said. "The simplest way for a company to
protect itself is to make sure that everything gets shredded."</TE>
<TE>   So is there any kind of document that shouldn't be shredded? Johnson
couldn't think of anything, though he did have a moment of pause some
years back when $3 million worth of negotiable traveler's checks were
unexpectedly delivered to his shredding company. After checking with the
client bank, the checks were destroyed.</TE>
<TE>   Virtually all Fortune 500 companies now use shredders or employ
shredding services on a regular basis. Shredders range from industrial
models--hulking machines capable of swallowing tons of material an
hour--to personal models that fit atop office waste baskets. Personal
shredders, which can be found at most office supply stores, range in
price from under $50 to more than $300.</TE>
<TE>   Shredding, though, isn't just for paper. These days shredding means
destroying most everything, from bottles and cans to defective condoms.
Casinos often use shredders to destroy worn-out betting chips, used dice
and playing cards. Old tires, carpet, syringes and even crab shells are
routinely pulverized in these machines whose huge steel jaws can turn
most anything to dust.</TE>
<TE>   Wagner recalled one instance in which eight trailer loads of defective
toys were shredded at a South Carolina plant. In another case, he said
225 trailers filled with video game rejects had to be shredded in 30
days. To prevent knockoffs from ever reaching the market, here or abroad,
fake Rolex watches, bogus Gucci purses and counterfeit tennis shoes also
have found their way to the shredding machines.</TE>
<TE>   Peter Dempsey, president of Security Engineered Machinery, began
providing U.S. Navy ships with shredders after the 1968 Pueblo incident,
when the American spy ship could not get rid of all its secret documents
after being captured by North Korea.</TE>
<TE>   Dempsey said that in addition to providing shredding machinery to the
Navy, his company shreds U.S. currency and postage stamps. The currency
is cut into tiny specks of paper and deposited in landfills. "We like to
say we make money by destroying it," Dempsey said.</TE>
<TE>   Over the years, a number of Academy Award statuettes had been turned
back over to the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, mostly
because of dents and scratches from falls. (For $350, the owners got new
ones.) About seven years ago, Academy Executive Director Bruce Davis
noticed his closet was filled with the statuettes, 15 in all. He was
faced with the dilemma of what to do with them. Tossing them in the trash
was out of the question because odds were they would be retrieved and
sold.</TE>
<TE>   "They'd show up on EBay two days later and you end up with a dignity
problem," said Davis, who eventually approached the company that handled
the academy's paper shredding. No problem, said Shred It of Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Davis watched as the first of the damaged Oscars was fed into the
machine. "These jaws ate it up and turned it into shrapnel."</TE>

<HD>Stimulus Bill on Way to Its Death</HD>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>A bitterly divided Senate is expected today to shelve a key part of
President Bush's domestic program: legislation that seeks to boost the
economy by cutting taxes and expanding aid to the unemployed.</LD>
<LD>   Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle (D-S.D.) said Tuesday he plans to
withdraw the bill from the Senate floor after a pair of showdown votes
that are all but certain to end in an impasse.</LD>
<LD>   "It's with great regret I will pull the bill," Daschle told reporters
just one day after Bush renewed his call for the stimulus legislation as
part of his new budget.</LD>
<TE>   The death of the bill would likely dash hopes for any further tax cuts
for the year--including long-discussed proposals to provide cash payments
to people who did not receive tax rebates last year, new corporate tax
breaks and Bush's plan to speed up implementation of last year's income
tax cuts.</TE>
<TE>   Two months ago, the Senate killed a stimulus package that had been
approved by the House, but at the time lawmakers said the issue would be
revived when Congress returned from its holiday recess.</TE>
<TE>   Bush has incessantly prodded the Senate to pass the stimulus measure,
saying it is needed as an "insurance policy" even as the economy
brightens. The bill's anticipated derailment bodes poorly for bipartisan
cooperation on other domestic issues in this election year.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm very disappointed," Bush told reporters after hearing of the
impending Senate action. "There's a lot of workers who hurt, and they
need help. Our economy, while there's some good news, needs more
stimulus."</TE>
<TE>   Democrats said they may try later this year to expand unemployment
benefits as part of another bill, but many Republicans are sure to oppose
such a move.</TE>
<TE>Democrats Balked at Business Tax Breaks</TE>
<TE>   The stimulus bill, first proposed in the wake of the Sept. 11
terrorist attacks, fell victim to election-year political pressures that
drove the parties into warring factions on economic issues that are
crucial to their core constituencies. Democrats, for instance, balked at
the extent of tax breaks that Republicans sought for businesses.</TE>
<TE>   The bill also was hurt by skepticism--among lawmakers as well as
outside analysts--about whether its provisions would substantially help
an economy that already appears on the mend. Indeed, the final blow may
have come from the economy itself. Amid signs the recession is ending,
questions grew about whether any stimulus bill was needed.</TE>
<TE>   The long and tortured process that led to the bill's likely demise
speaks volumes about how hard it is for a narrowly divided Congress to
set economic policy in a timely fashion.</TE>
<TE>   "It's an indictment of our ability to get together and act in the
public interest," said Sen. Phil Gramm (R-Texas).</TE>
<TE>   As such comments indicate, the end of the legislative debate over the
stimulus bill would mark just the beginning of a fierce political
argument over who is to blame for Congress' failure to respond to the
nation's economic ills.</TE>
<TE>   Republicans have already begun accusing Democrats, especially Daschle,
of refusing to compromise for political gain.</TE>
<TE>GOP Only Wants Its Package, Daschle Says</TE>
<TE>   "The Daschle Democrats, in a cynical effort to score political points
against this president, have chosen to fire a direct shot into a limping
economy by killing the economic stimulus package," said Senate Republican
Leader Trent Lott (R-Miss.).</TE>
<TE>   But Daschle, in turn, accused Republicans of blocking a stripped-down
version of the measure he offered earlier this year as a compromise.</TE>
<TE>   "They don't want a stimulus package unless it is their stimulus
package," Daschle said.</TE>
<TE>   Beyond the finger-pointing, another factor sapping the bill's momentum
has been the emergence of budget deficits. Members of both parties are
increasingly concerned that the long-term costs to federal coffers of
cutting taxes and increasing spending would outweigh the short-term
benefits to the economy.</TE>
<TE>   That suggests a silver lining for fiscal conservatives in the collapse
of the stimulus bill: If Congress does not enact its provisions, deficits
may be smaller. For instance, the Bush budget projects a deficit in
fiscal 2003 of $80 billion. But virtually all of that deficit is premised
on passage of a stimulus bill.</TE>
<TE>   The Republican Study Committee, a conservative group in the House, is
arguing that if the stimulus bill remains sidetracked, lawmakers should
aim to draft a balanced budget.</TE>
<TE>   The debate over the stimulus bill spotlighted basic differences
between the parties on economic policy: Republicans argue that the
flagging economy would be better served by tax cuts to businesses to spur
job creation, while Democrats said the bill should focus on helping the
unemployed weather the downturn.</TE>
<TE>   The GOP-dominated House passed two versions of a stimulus bill late
last year. Both centered on tax cuts for individuals and businesses,
including Bush's proposal to speed up scheduled reductions of income tax
rates and roll back the corporate alternative minimum tax.</TE>
<TE>   Democrats who control the Senate pushed a bill more heavily weighted
to providing aid to unemployed people.</TE>
<TE>   After the Senate failed to agree on the issue in December, Republicans
accelerated their efforts to blame Daschle for blocking action. In
response, Daschle early this year proposed a stripped-down version of the
bill.</TE>
<TE>   Faced with pressure to move on to other matters, Daschle scheduled
votes for today to close debate on his bill and on the Republican
alternative. But in his comments Tuesday, Daschle said that neither
measure would draw the 60 votes needed to close debate and proceed to a
final vote.</TE>
<TE>   Republicans agreed with that assessment.</TE>
<TE>Greenspan Comments Hurt Compromise Odds</TE>
<TE>   Both sides insisted they were prepared to continue negotiations to
revive the stimulus issue later this year. But many lawmakers also agree
that compromise seems more remote than ever, especially following Federal
Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan's comments last week that the economy had
improved enough that a stimulus bill was probably not necessary.</TE>
<TE>   In recent days, both sides have been asserting that the other party's
proposal is so misguided it would be better to do nothing.</TE>
<TE>   Citing advice from economists that Congress should "do no harm,"
Daschle said, "The Republican package does serious harm to the budget, to
fairness in tax law and to a number of other issues that the American
people care deeply about."</TE>
<TE>   Summing up GOP attitudes toward the Daschle bill, House Majority
Leader Dick Armey (R-Texas) said, "If the Senate . . . cannot do anything
good, we're better off doing nothing at all."</TE>
<TE>   Times staff writer Edwin Chen contributed to this report.</TE>

<LD>On the floor of Montana's Bitterroot Valley, so far, far away from
lower Manhattan, Jane Ellis finds herself on the front lines of a war she
never contemplated, trying to prepare for attacks she can barely imagine.</LD>
<LD>   Ellis directs the county Office of Emergency Management in Missoula.
On a fine, crisp day, she showed a visitor around her piece of the
American homeland, pointing out possible terrorist targets: the shopping
mall and public waterworks, government buildings and chemical
storehouses.</LD>
<LD>   While not wanting to seem a "Chicken Little," Ellis said it only made
sense to revisit old assumptions, to look at familiar landmarks with new
eyes and to "do some brainstorming: What if?" "The realm of
possibilities," Ellis said, "has increased infinitely since Sept. 11."</LD>
<TE>   In the months since the attacks on the World Trade Center and the
Pentagon, in big cities and in small towns, on bridges and at border
crossings, Americans have been girding for assault from the shadows,
recalculating "the realm of possibilities" in a strange new war.</TE>
<TE>   Much of the response has been patchwork, improvised--from the
uniformed officer stationed at meetings of the Cullman, Ala., City
Council, to the sawhorse barricades placed around public buildings in
downtown Missoula.</TE>
<TE>   In a sense, the effort to shore up the home front against terrorism is
an exercise in seeking balance: between added security and reduced
openness and convenience; between the likelihood a threat might
materialize and the cost of eliminating it.</TE>
<TE>   President Bush has left no doubt that security will be a preoccupation
of government. In his State of the Union address last week, and in the
proposed budget he sent to Congress on Monday, Bush called for nearly
doubling homeland defense spending, to $38 billion, and enlisting tens of
thousands of volunteers to help police, fire and public health
departments.</TE>
<TE>   "There is a new world order, a new way of thinking," said Constance
Perett, Los Angeles County's emergency management administrator. "I don't
think there is anyone who says, 'Well, that isn't likely to occur.' I
mean, how many people thought terrorists could commandeer jetliners and
crash them into the World Trade Center and Pentagon? We know all it takes
is someone to dream it up and someone to execute it."</TE>
<TE>   In a nondescript county building five miles east of downtown Los
Angeles, anti-terrorism strategists huddle each day for "mind-mapping"
sessions. The minds they try to map are those of terrorists.</TE>
<TE>   The Early Terrorism Warning Group, started five years ago, went on
full-time footing after Sept. 11. It often is cited by terrorism experts
as a model for the nation.</TE>
<TE>   At the group's command center, representatives of assorted government
agencies troll the world by computer, sifting the Web sites of foreign
newspapers, police departments, extremists--any forum that might yield
tips about impending attacks or trends in terrorists' methods or
intentions.</TE>
<TE>   As they gather information, task force members discuss what it means
for Southern California. What might tensions between Pakistan and India
trigger in the L.A. Basin? Are the region's airports alert to the
possibility of shoe bombs?</TE>
<TE>   "Political violence," Los Angeles County sheriff's Sgt. John P.
Sullivan said, "is designed to cause a discernible political effect: You
knock down the World Trade Center because you want to send a signal that
great societal change is coming. It is not just to kill people. In
terrorism, violence is instrumental or symbolic. So what you are doing is
fighting a battle of the minds."</TE>
<TE>War Has Always Been 'Over There,' Not Here</TE>
<TE>   Buffered on the east and west by oceans, bordered on the north and
south by friendly neighbors, the United States had long seemed an island
on the world map. Wars were fought "over there," and civil defense was
the stuff of fussy old men and back-country paranoids.</TE>
<TE>   There was an aggressive effort during World War II to prepare the
nation for bombing attacks and even an invasion--with block captains and
blackouts and the like--but the system never was put to the test. When
Hollywood got around to depicting the effort on film, with a 1943
offering called "Air Raid Wardens," it chose for its leading men Stan
Laurel and Oliver Hardy, the slapstick comedians.</TE>
<TE>   The nuclear threat did dent the psychic armor, producing the
duck-and-cover drills and bomb shelters of the late 1950s. These
disappeared as the dueling superpowers built vast nuclear stockpiles,
making survivability a moot point.</TE>
<TE>   In the days before Sept. 11, the United States was a nation with its
guard down. The 4,000-mile border with Canada was guarded by just 330
Border Patrol agents, despite intelligence that terrorists had
established cells in Canada.</TE>
<TE>   Fighter jets were on alert at seven air defense sites, down from the
100 bases across the continent that had kept planes ready to scramble
during the Cold War. The top general of the California National Guard was
preoccupied, not with patrolling the Golden Gate Bridge--that would come
later--but with ensuring there was money enough in a tight budget for
uniforms.</TE>
<TE>   The phrase "homeland security" was familiar only to a relative few
academicians and public policy types who had begun to warn persistently
about the threat of large-scale terrorist attacks--only to be just as
persistently ignored.</TE>
<TE>   Since the attacks, these same experts have found themselves much in
demand. On a Friday in early October, Coast Guard Cmdr. Stephen Flynn, an
expert on security holes in transportation systems, was seated with a
panel of witnesses in a Senate hearing room on Capitol Hill.</TE>
<TE>   Under discussion was how the new Cabinet-level White House Office of
Homeland Security might be structured. There was back-and-forth about
veto power, budget authority, bureaucratic shapes--"about moving around
the boxes," as one senator phrased it.</TE>
<TE>   Should Thomas J. Ridge, the homeland security director, be a
coordinator or a "czar"? Would he have real power or, as former U.S. drug
czar Gen. Barry R. McCaffrey warned, would he be "relegated to running
the speakers bureau on counter-terrorism?" a quip that produced knowing
chuckles all around.</TE>
<TE>   Flynn was the next-to-last witness. In the Coast Guard, he had chased
drug smugglers, tended buoys, the works. For the last two years, while
retaining his service rank, Flynn had directed a homeland security study
for the Council on Foreign Relations, a New York-based think tank.</TE>
<TE>   In this latest capacity, he had concentrated on transportation
systems--exploring ports, border crossings, railways, airports. "The
question I've been asking," he told three senators still in the room, "is
how do we filter the bad from the good, the dangerous from the benign?
And the answer is, we don't."</TE>
<TE>   Leaning forward, hunched over the witness table, his reddening neck
flexed into a starched, white shirt collar, this 41-year-old son of a
Coast Guard lifer barked out his testimony in a thick New England accent.</TE>
<TE>   Flynn tossed out numbers. Thousands upon thousands of container boxes
move by rail and truck across the country each day, he said, "and we
don't have a clue what's in them." Compared to what passes for security
at ports and border crossings, he said, commercial aviation could be seen
as "Ft. Knox."</TE>
<TE>   He painted scenarios. He described how an attack in the Port of Los
Angeles by a single, explosives-laden motorboat, if carried out at the
right time and place, could rupture the oil infrastructure in a manner
that would "effectively shut down the Southern California economy in
three to four days."</TE>
<TE>   He told how a container could make its way by ship from Karachi,
Pakistan, to Long Beach and then move across the country by rail or truck
without undergoing even the most cursory inspection. And don't worry
about giving terrorists ideas: "The bad guys know all this. What worries
me is that the good guys don't."</TE>
<TE>   Flynn cited the multitude of security agencies at work in ports and
along the border. He described how their missions sometimes overlap and
sometimes leave gaps, and how incompatible radio equipment often prevents
communication between the gatekeeper agencies--which in the last year
alone waved 489 million people, 127 million cars and 211,000 boats into
the United States.</TE>
<TE>   "Houston," he said, "we have a problem."</TE>
<TE>   No longer could this nation view defense as something that ran "from
the water's edge out." Now it must operate from the "'water's edge in."</TE>
<TE>   There was silence when Flynn finished. In that quiet pause it seemed
as if everyone in the room was lingering over the same thought: Maybe
this is about more than moving around the boxes.</TE>
<TE>Spasm of Security May Be Fleeting</TE>
<TE>   While Sept. 11 certainly jolted awake a nation of Rip Van Winkles, it
is not at all certain whether the current impulse to fortify, to throw up
bulwarks and stuff high-rise lobbies with security guards in sharp blue
blazers, will prove lasting.</TE>
<TE>   In the past, the U.S. has demonstrated a remarkable capacity for
rolling over and going back to sleep, no matter how terrible the
nightmare. In the last decade alone, it has absorbed and shrugged off
several big terrorist blows--the first World Trade Center bombing in
1993, the Oklahoma City federal building bombing in 1995 and attacks on
two embassies in Africa in 1998.</TE>
<TE>   Maj. Gen. Paul Monroe, head of California's National Guard, tells of
traveling to Washington with his wife after Sept. 11. They were struck by
the heightened security, the checkpoints, the concrete "Jersey barriers"
blocking streets around the Capitol.</TE>
<TE>   "My wife asked me, how long is this going to last?" Monroe recalled.
"I told her, 'Until you get upset about it.' . . . That's the way our
society is. As soon as the threat is gone, we don't want it in our face
anymore."</TE>
<TE>   An alternate view is that terrorists will not allow the nation to
return to its slumbers. According to this line of thought, war as
conflict between nation-states, with soldiers in uniforms and rules of
engagement to protect civilians, is giving way to "asymmetric warfare,"
more commonly known as terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   This was the intellectual backdrop for a series of reports over the
last couple of years by the U.S. Commission on National Security. Chaired
by former Sens. Gary Hart and Warren B. Rudman, the commission completed
its work early in 2001. Its findings, which initially drew little public
notice, now leap off the page:</TE>
<TE>   "For many years to come, Americans will become increasingly less
secure, and much less secure than they now believe themselves to be. That
is because many of the threats emerging in our future will differ
significantly from those of the past, not only in their physical but also
in their psychological effects."</TE>
<TE>   In an interview, Hart said he still believes terrorism can be
defeated: "We will beat it by being smarter than the terrorists. That
does not mean sitting down writing science fiction all day. It means
thinking ahead and questioning assumptions.</TE>
<TE>   "The reason we didn't think about commercial airliners as guided
missiles was that we thought we had solved the hijacking problem. The
profiles were wrong. What we assumed about the nature of hijacking was
wrong. We weren't smart enough. We weren't thinking as these people were
thinking."</TE>
<TE>   In Missoula, a place seemingly far removed from the tangle of
geopolitics and dire millennial prophecies, Ellis said she had tried her
hand at "thinking like a terrorist" and found it more than a little
difficult.</TE>
<TE>   "It's really hard to think like they think," said Ellis, a
self-described "proud redneck," with teased hair and a teasing sense of
humor. "That is so contrary to our basic value system. . . . It doesn't
compute for us."</TE>
<TE>   Nonetheless, she dutifully has scraped together a list of possible
terrorist targets--the reservoir, chemical storehouses and the like--and
reviewed the county's emergency rescue and evacuation plans. In Ellis'
mind, though, it is not her role to outwit Osama bin Laden. Rather, she
must ensure the county is ready for whatever threats develop--and
terrorism does not necessarily top the list.</TE>
<TE>   "We can't possibly deal with all that is possible," she said. "We must
deal with what is most likely."</TE>
<TE>   Dealing with terrorism "stuff," she said, "is taking time away from
working on problems we know we are going to face. I should be going
through solicitations for new hardware to replace the county's emergency
communications system.</TE>
<TE>   "Now, I'm truly concerned about whether we are going to be able to get
that hardware bought in time to get it installed on the mountaintops
before winter. That's a real scenario we will face."</TE>
<TE>   Ellis stopped downtown to point out the new sawhorse barriers in
parking spaces around a government building. "As if a truck couldn't
barrel through that," she said, shaking her head. And then she was off to
meet the fire chief, who had a story to tell about Missoula's first
anthrax scare, a false alarm. Something to do with a grandmother and a
mail-order doll.</TE>
<TE>Targets Protected, Targets Exposed</TE>
<TE>   In Chicago, high-rise building maps have been placed on CD-ROMs for
quick reference in emergencies; plans have been laid to stockpile heavy
fire equipment throughout the Sears Tower, which will eliminate the need
to haul it up several flights of stairs in a crisis.</TE>
<TE>   In Washington, garbage cans and recycling bins have been removed from
subway stations--a precaution against bombs. Bismarck, N.D., now guards
its water tanks and reservoirs. Air space has been restricted over some
nuclear power plants.</TE>
<TE>   In Los Angeles and Long Beach, the Coast Guard has greatly expanded
armed patrols at the world's busiest port complex, boarding and
inspecting vessels several miles off the coast.</TE>
<TE>   For every potential threat addressed, however, for every Jersey
barrier and barbed-wire fence, another target or six is added to the list
of the exposed. One day a private study warns about attacks on the
Trans-Alaska Pipeline System and the crucial stretch of California
electrical transmission line known as Path 15; the next day, Ridge
expresses concern about the safety of crops in the field.</TE>
<TE>   In an April 2000 paper on homeland defense, Anthony Cordesman of the
Center for Strategic and International Studies made the point that not
every hole can be plugged and that trying to do so can backfire:</TE>
<TE>   "The United States cannot afford to overreact to threats which may be
repellent or horrific in character but which are of low probability or
which have no more actuarial consequences than the kind of natural
disasters that are a constant occurrence. It cannot give homeland defense
a higher public policy priority than other risks."</TE>
<TE>   In an interview, Cordesman elaborated: "Generally we deal with these
sorts of things by patterns: If something causes enough deaths, it is
time to fix it. Here, because of the very nature of asymmetric warfare,
we are not going to be getting the same attack each time. In fact, fixing
one thing might tell terrorists to go attack something else, to go find a
new target."</TE>
<TE>   Coast Guard Cmdr. Flynn sees a "small window of opportunity" to put in
place significant security measures, a race against the apathy that will
arise in the absence of a second strike.</TE>
<TE>   A few weeks after his Washington testimony, he flew into Newark, N.J.,
to meet with shipping executives. During the flight, Flynn reflected on
his performance before the Senate committee.</TE>
<TE>   As he waited to testify, and listened to the placid exchanges about
the movement of bureaucratic boxes, he wondered to himself:</TE>
<TE>   "Are we going sit around and have one of those Washington
conversations about how hard it is to restructure government, to
reapportion power? You know, 'Isn't there a more painless way to do
this?' All that usual stuff."</TE>
<TE>   On the ground, he spent the day debriefing managers of shipping lines,
port terminals and truck companies. These tended to be men with big necks
and big hands and big concerns about anything that might slow down the
flow of containers through the port--part of the ever-churning conveyor
belt of the global economy.</TE>
<TE>   At each meeting, Flynn would suggest security measures--better
tracking of freight through computer technologies, inspection of
containers as they are loaded rather than at their destinations,
tamper-proof metal seals to identify suspicious cargo so that non-suspect
freight could move more quickly.</TE>
<TE>   "But with all of these issues," said a shipping company official who
had listened warily to Flynn's pitch, "there's going to be a cost factor.
Where does the cost fall?"</TE>
<TE>   Flynn had a ready answer. It's a point he's been making since Sept. 11
to anybody who will listen:</TE>
<TE>   In the immediate response to Sept. 11, this nation did something no
foreign power would dare even attempt. It placed an almost complete
blockade on its economy, grounding airplanes, closing ports, cinching up
the borders. For day after day, nothing moved.</TE>
<TE>   The hijackings had been interpreted not as a "breach of security,"
Flynn said, "but as an absence of security." So it seemed only prudent to
assume that "any plane, train, ship or truck could have been a bomb."</TE>
<TE>   Should a second strike occur before a credible system of security is
in place, it will happen again, Flynn said. It might even be worse.</TE>
<TE>   "They will shut you down," Flynn told the shippers.</TE>
<TE>   Not just Newark but across the country and beyond.</TE>
<TE>   "They will turn the spigot off, and they will shut you down."</TE>
<TE>   This seemed to get their attention, at least for the moment.</TE>

<HD>Southern Californians Buy Into the Lifestyle</HD>
<DH>Survey: Data show that area consumers spend generously on looking
good and doing good.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARLA DICKERSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Southern Californians spend more on housing, cars, clothes and
grooming and less on books, booze and cigarettes than the rest of the
country.</LD>
<LD>   So says a government survey released Tuesday on consumer spending that
would seem to confirm some cliches about the local lifestyle.</LD>
<LD>   But although L.A. denizens might be a little self-absorbed when it
comes to looking good, they're also generous, devoting a much bigger
slice of their annual expenditures to charity than folks in the San
Francisco area, who also spend twice as much on alcohol.</LD>
<TE>   These cultural and financial glimpses come courtesy of the Consumer
Expenditure Survey, a dry, numerical compilation of household spending by
the Bureau of Labor Statistics that nevertheless yields some juicy
details on how people in different parts of the U.S. spend money.</TE>
<TE>   Tuesday's data for the Los Angeles area, which the survey identifies
as Los Angeles, Riverside and Orange counties, reflect the most recent
annual spending figures based on long-term household surveys taken in
1999 and 2000.</TE>
<TE>   The survey confirms some regional myths. For example, households in
Dallas-Fort Worth do have Texas-size appetites, devoting $6,865, or 14.7%
of their annual expenditures, to food, compared with the U.S. average of
$5,094, or 13.5%.</TE>
<TE>   In the South, where iced tea is the drink of choice, Atlantans, with
$322 in average annual alcohol expenditures, look like teetotalers
compared with consumers in Denver, where households spend an average of
$621 a year heading for the rocky mountains of Coors.</TE>
<TE>   "Usually cliches are based on some reality," said Mihaly
Csikszentmihalyi, a social psychologist and management professor at the
Claremont Graduate University. "The presentation of self through
appearance is more important in Southern California . . . so these
findings aren't really all that strange."</TE>
<TE>   Csikszentmihalyi was nonplused at the news that Southern California
households spend $148 a year on books, compared with $153 nationally.</TE>
<TE>   "The weather is too nice to cuddle up with a good book," he said.</TE>
<TE>   In the Los Angeles area, the average household devoted $16,550, or 37%
of its annual expenditures, to shelter--more than a third above the
national average.</TE>
<TE>   On a percentage basis, households in the region are devoting even more
of their resources to housing than pricey San Francisco or San Diego,
where households earmarked just under 36% of their annual spending for
shelter.</TE>
<TE>   The figures come as no surprise to local economy watchers, who say
L.A.'s fast-growing population, high concentration of low-wage workers
and short supply of new housing add up to budget-busting expenditures on
housing.</TE>
<TE>   "Scarcity forces people to pay more," said Jack Kyser, chief economist
for the Los Angeles County Economic Development Corp.</TE>
<TE>   If there is one image across the country that defines Angelenos, it is
their love affair with the automobile.</TE>
<TE>   On average, L.A.-area households shell out $7,701 annually to keep
their cars on the road, compared with the U.S. average of $7,215. Still,
it's not as bad as it seems. On a percentage basis, Southlanders devote
less of their spending on getting around--17.2%--than the rest of the
nation--19.2%.</TE>
<TE>   The focus on image and the body is evident in expenditures on booze
and cigarettes, which are lower than the national average.</TE>
<TE>   Households here spent $337 annually during the survey period for
alcohol, compared with the U.S. average of $345. By comparison,
wine-loving San Franciscans dropped $771 on alcoholic beverages. And
California's tough no-smoking laws, high tobacco taxes and
health-conscious lifestyle appear to be paying off in terms of tobacco
expenditures.</TE>
<TE>   The average Los Angeles household spent just $204 annually on tobacco
products during the survey period, compared with the U.S. average of
$309.</TE>
<TE>   For Angelenos, the ultimate statement of identity appears to be
clothing, according to the BLS data.</TE>
<TE>   During the 1999-2000 survey period, Los Angeles-area households spent
an average of $2,450 annually on apparel. That's 35% more than the U.S.
average on a dollar basis and well ahead of buttoned-down cities such as
Seattle ($1,918) and Portland, Ore. ($1,507).</TE>
<TE>   Ilse Metchek, head of the California Fashion Assn., isn't surprised.
She says Hollywood and the city's apparel industry make L.A. a fashion
trendsetter, a place where residents are already on to the next big thing
by the time the last fad hits middle America.</TE>
<TE>   Although it might seem logical that people in colder climates would
spend more for clothing, Metchek said balmy weather means Southern
Californians feel the need to look sharp all the time. She recently
returned from a trip to Seattle and pronounced it a fashion disaster
area.</TE>
<TE>   "I've never seen so many basic jeans and cloddy shoes," Metchek
sniffed. "I guess those dot-com millionaires never figured out how to
dress."</TE>

<LD>A handful of senior Enron Corp. executives sold $44 million in
company stock while concerns were growing inside the company that losses
racked up by a group of obscure partnerships could spill into public
view, records show.</LD>
<LD>   The huge investment losses by the four so-called Raptor partnerships
were disclosed months later and played a key role in forcing Enron in
October to say it had overstated the value of the company by $1.2
billion, spurring the company's filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy
protection Dec. 2.</LD>
<LD>   Stock sales by Enron executives before the company's descent
previously have come under a spotlight, but the timing of the sales
gained new significance with the release Saturday of an internal Enron
investigation that detailed the executives' knowledge of the Raptor
problems.</LD>
<TE>   Four Enron executives--including former President and Chief Executive
Jeffrey K. Skilling and former Chief Financial Officer Andrew S.
Fastow--sold about $44 million in stock from Aug. 7, 2000, when the
Raptor problems became known internally, through March 26, 2001, when the
partnerships were restructured to prevent disclosure of losses, according
to a review of stock sales Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   There is no evidence that the sales were directly related to knowledge
of the problems facing the Raptors. But any stock sales by executives
based on information not available to the public could be construed as
trading on inside information, a federal crime, according to a Washington
securities lawyer who declined to speak for attribution.</TE>
<TE>   The executives--Skilling, Fastow and Chief Accounting Officer Richard
A. Causey and Chief Risk Officer Richard B. Buy--could not be reached for
comment.</TE>
<TE>   During the period Aug. 7, 2000, to March 26, 2001, Skilling had stock
sales totaling $28.2 million, and Fastow sales totaling $4.3 million,
according to data compiled by Thomson Financial, a securities research
firm.</TE>
<TE>   Causey's sales totaled $7.1 million and Buy's totaled $4.3 million,
Thomson said.</TE>
<TE>   The sales came at a time when Enron executives were concerned that
losses by the Raptors could force damaging public disclosure. The fear of
disclosing those losses led Enron to expand and restructure the Raptors
during an eight-month period in 2000-01 to keep its losses off the
corporate books, according to an Enron board committee's internal report
issued Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   Only an elaborate reorganization of the Raptors last March 26 saved
Enron from having to disclose a $504-million loss on its first-quarter
financial statements, according to Enron's internal report.</TE>
<TE>   Starting April 18, 2000, Enron created the first of four Raptor
entities so that losses in its investment portfolio (including stocks)
would not show up on Enron's income statement, the internal report said.
The Raptors, which were little known beyond a small group of corporate
insiders, allowed the energy company to hedge, or shield itself from,
future losses on its investment portfolio by shifting some of the risk to
the Raptors.</TE>
<TE>   Enron provided the initial funding for three of the Raptors with
shares of its own stock. Each one also received a modest investment from
a related partnership headed by Fastow.</TE>
<TE>   In essence, the Raptors agreed to cover potential losses on certain
Enron investments. As long as the value of the Enron shares backing the
Raptors held up, the entities would be able to pay their debts to the
energy giant. Enron counted the debts owed by the Raptors as income,
offsetting losses from its portfolio.</TE>
<TE>   Soon after creating the Raptors, however, Enron executives learned how
quickly they could slip into trouble.</TE>
<TE>   According to the report, Skilling, Fastow, Causey and Buy attended an
Aug. 7, 2000, meeting of Enron's finance committee in which Treasurer Ben
Glisan noted that the credit capacity of Raptor I was "almost completely
utilized and that Raptor II would not be available" until months later.
The committee recommended creating a Raptor IV, but before that could be
activated executives created, without board approval, Raptor III without
informing the board.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike the other entities, Raptor III was not backed by Enron stock,
making it what the internal investigation called an "extraordinarily
fragile structure."</TE>
<TE>   One day after Raptor III became active, on Sept. 28, 2000, Causey
exercised 61,097 stock options and sold an additional 19,536 shares,
netting $5.4 million, according to the analysis by Thomson. That was one
of only four days Enron's chief accounting officer has traded shares,
according to Thomson.</TE>
<TE>   By late 2000, two of the entities, Raptor I and Raptor III, were
essentially insolvent, lacking the credit to be able to pay back their
debts, the report said.</TE>
<TE>   Raptor III was in especially bad shape. Unlike the three other
entities, Raptor III was essentially backed by shares of New Power Co.,
an Enron spinoff that quickly foundered after going public. But under the
deal designed by Enron accountants, the more that New Power shares fell,
the more money Raptor III owed Enron.</TE>
<TE>   New Power went public Oct. 5, 2000. By mid-November, the stock had
lost 50% of its value, threatening to wreak havoc with the Raptor
structure and force Enron to disclose huge losses, according to the
internal report.</TE>
<TE>   On Nov. 7, Fastow sold 52,080 shares at $83 each for a gross of $4.32
million. Filings reviewed by Thomson did not indicate Fastow's cost, so
his net gain on the sales is unclear. Stock sales by Fastow earlier in
the year--after the Raptors had been devised but before they showed signs
of serious trouble--netted him an estimated $3.4 million.</TE>
<TE>   To avoid having to disclose a huge loss, Enron executives on Dec. 22,
2000, merged the credit of the four Raptors under a 45-day pact, allowing
Enron to avoid reporting a credit-reserve loss in its year-end financial
statements.</TE>
<TE>   In early January, Enron accountants began work to develop a more
permanent solution to replace the 45-day agreement, according to the
internal report. The accountants designed a complex restructuring that
took effect March 26, 2001.</TE>
<TE>   "We were told that, during the first quarter of 2001, Skilling said
that fixing the Raptors' credit capacity problems was one of the
company's highest priorities," the report said.</TE>
<TE>   Skilling has disputed that account. He told the board investigation
team, led by Texas Law School dean William Powers, that he recalls being
informed of the Raptors' credit problems "in only general terms" and that
he understood the matter to be "an accounting issue."</TE>
<TE>   The committee found that "either Skilling was not nearly as involved
in Enron's business as his reputation--and his own description of his
approach to the job--would suggest, or he was deliberately kept in the
dark by those involved in the restructuring."</TE>
<TE>   By February 2001, Enron accountants were providing daily reports of
the credit status of at least two of the Raptors to Causey and Buy,
according to the internal report.</TE>
<TE>   Tension built through March 2001, according to the report, after
executives became aware that Enron would have to take a pretax charge
against earnings of about $504 million to reflect the shortfall in credit
capacity of Raptors I and III.</TE>
<TE>   Buy, who had not traded any Enron shares since becoming Enron's chief
risk officer in mid-1999, began an intense sell-off Jan. 2, 2001.
According to Thomson's analysis, the 54,874 shares he sold from that date
through March 5 of that year are the only shares he has sold since taking
that post. The sales netted him an estimated $2.8 million.</TE>
<TE>   For his part, Enron's since-ousted chairman and chief executive,
Kenneth L. Lay, knew of the creation of the Raptors, the internal report
said. But investigators said they found no evidence that Lay, who stepped
aside as CEO in February 2001 in favor of Skilling, was aware of the
entities' debts and reorganization.</TE>
<TE>   On Aug. 24, 2000, Lay exercised 140,230 options and sold 75,000
shares, netting a $4.09-million profit on the day. On Nov. 1, he settled
into a pattern, selling blocks of 1,000 to 4,000 shares almost every day
until August 2001.</TE>
<TE>   In hindsight, the committee said, Enron's top executives, as well as
outside advisors including accounting firm Andersen, should have kept
closer oversight ofthe Raptors and other partnerships.</TE>
<TE>   "The creation, and especially the subsequent restructuring, of the
Raptors was perceived by many within Enron as a triumph of accounting
ingenuity by a group of innovative accountants," the committee report
said. "We believe . . . especially after the restructuring, the Raptors
were little more than a highly complex accounting construct that was
destined to collapse."</TE>
<TE>   Leeds reported from Houston, Mulligan from New York.</TE>

<HD>Hahn Explains Stance on Chief; Many Express Anger</HD>
<DH>LAPD: Mayor says Parks has lagged on reforms; some backers say they
feel betrayed.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MATEA GOLD</AU>
<AU>JILL LEOVY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Los Angeles Mayor James K. Hahn said Tuesday that he is opposing
Police Chief Bernard C. Parks' bid for a second term in part because of
the chief's failure to advance police reform, but the mayor's explanation
was angrily rejected by many of the same leaders who supported him in
last year's mayoral election.</LD>
<LD>   "I'm in shock, my community is in shock," said City Councilman Nate
Holden, one of Parks' strongest supporters and a longtime backer of Hahn
as well. "It's disrespectful not only for my community, but for the
people of Los Angeles."</LD>
<LD>   Parks stayed out of public view--he had been scheduled to attend a
conference in Anaheim, but police officials said he stayed home with his
family. A police spokesman said the chief was disappointed, but
encouraged by Hahn's pledge that the city's Police Commission--the panel
that will decide Parks' fate--will give him a fair hearing.</LD>
<TE>   Hahn's move tests the historical alliance between the Hahn family and
African American voters, who were a quarter of Hahn's supporters in last
year's election. By breaking from black leaders who have rallied around
Parks, Hahn upended relationships that have shaped both his career and
Los Angeles politics.</TE>
<TE>   "It's really a defining action for him," said Cal State Fullerton
professor Rafael Sonenshein, an expert on the City Charter and the LAPD.
"It's stepping out front of what is usually available for Los Angeles
mayors to hide behind, which is the commission system. In this case, he
went right past it. It's a very bold, strong decision."</TE>
<TE>   But African American political officials and activists characterized
it as a betrayal. All three African American City Council members
condemned Hahn's opposition to Parks, as did a number of other prominent
leaders.</TE>
<TE>   Some said they were even contemplating a recall campaign against the
man they fought to get into office less than a year ago.</TE>
<TE>   Many of those interviewed Tuesday stressed that their reactions went
beyond defensiveness about Parks because of his race. Parks was one of
the first African American officers to rise to the top ranks of the LAPD,
and his supporters view him as someone who has imposed a strong hand on a
police force viewed with suspicion for years. Although critics see him as
rigid, Parks' supporters praise his honesty and forcefulness.</TE>
<TE>   Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Los Angeles) said that although she doesn't
always agree with Parks, the mayor should find "room to work with someone
who has impeccable integrity."</TE>
<TE>   Waters campaigned for Hahn last year, but said Tuesday that she was
among those considering whether he should be recalled.</TE>
<TE>   "We're not going to discourage [the community] from being upset about
this," Waters said. "We're going to let them know that . . . we too feel
betrayed."</TE>
<TE>   Waters conceded that a recall might not be plausible, but other Hahn
supporters said they would be open to that idea.</TE>
<TE>   "People are really angry--my phone has been ringing off the hook
today," said Dorothy Freeman, who lives in the Athens neighborhood in
South Los Angeles. "I voted for him and I feel so betrayed."</TE>
<TE>   Many community leaders rejected Hahn's argument that Parks is not
doing a good job, saying that the chief has transformed a department that
has had a deeply troubled relationship with African Americans and others.</TE>
<TE>   "I heard a policeman say this morning on the radio that morale was low
and Parks doesn't allow them to do their job," said the Rev. M. Andrew
Robinson-Gaither of Faith United Methodist Church. "But to me, that means
Parks doesn't allow them to do their job in the old way of intimidating
people."</TE>
<TE>   Radio personality Tavis Smiley called Hahn's decision "a slap in the
face of African American voters, without whom Jimmy Hahn would never have
become mayor."</TE>
<TE>   Community activists said they will organize protests over the
decision, including one planned for tonight in Leimert Park.</TE>
<TE>   As those sentiments bubbled over in South Los Angeles, where Hahn's
father held office for decades, the mayor attempted to lay out his
rationale for opposing Parks at a news conference at City Hall.</TE>
<TE>   Speaking in somber tones, the mayor said he does not believe that the
chief is implementing federally mandated reforms of the department, and
also is failing to inspire a demoralized force and improve community
policing.</TE>
<TE>   "It is because of these differences that I cannot support his
reappointment," said Hahn. "I could not make this decision on politics
and personal friendships. I had to do what was best for the city and the
department."</TE>
<TE>   Hahn said he hoped that his African American supporters and other
residents would understand that he made his decision because of the
chief's performance.</TE>
<TE>   "I hope Los Angeles has grown to the point where we can make this
decision on the merits," he said. "I'm painfully aware of how difficult
this decision is for many people, including me, but I had to make this
decision on the merits."</TE>
<TE>   The mayor faulted Parks for lack of progress on a federal consent
decree, saying that the city is failing to comply with aspects of the
agreement designed to protect civil rights.</TE>
<TE>   Hahn said the department has not given the Police Commission
information about incidents of excessive use of force by officers. In
addition, he said, the chief does not agree with the merits of collecting
information about racial profiling.</TE>
<TE>   "Those are the reforms that I'm very concerned about, and I've been
unhappy with progress we're making on that," he said.</TE>
<TE>   LAPD Cmdr. Dan Koenig said that although the department is not in
perfect compliance with the agreement, great progress has been made,
noting that the city has not been sanctioned by the court.</TE>
<TE>   Terree Bowers, chief deputy city attorney, said an independent monitor
assigned to study the city's efforts "was generally complimentary of the
department for mobilizing so quickly." Bowers' boss, City Atty. Rocky
Delgadillo, endorsed Parks on Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   Hahn also argued that Parks does not share his concern about the
dwindling number of officers in the force, which is about 1,200 officers
short of its authorized strength.</TE>
<TE>   Deputy Chief Michael Bostic said the department is making progress on
recruitment and said it is too soon to judge the results. The LAPD got
approval for additional resources for recruiting in November and it takes
several months for new recruits to become officers, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Another factor that shaped Hahn's decision was the slow reinstatement
of the senior lead officer program, a community policing program that
Parks cut and then restored at the urging of Mayor Richard Riordan.</TE>
<TE>   But many neighborhood leaders complain that not all the officers are
back at their posts, a sentiment Hahn echoed Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   "The chief is a wonderful man and wonderful human being who I
enormously respect, but we disagree on some of these fundamental issues,"
Hahn said. "I think people elected me to make tough decisions. It was a
tough one."</TE>
<TE>   The debate now moves to the Police Commission, whose five members the
mayor appointed to set policy for the LAPD.</TE>
<TE>   The mayor said Tuesday that he would not lobby his commissioners,
adding that he wants them to consider his opinion, along with others in
the city, in making their decision. He said that if the panel chooses to
keep Parks on, he would work with the chief.</TE>
<TE>   Police Commission President Rick Caruso praised Hahn for making "a
very tough decision devoid of politics." But Caruso reiterated the
panel's intention of operating independently, adding that it wouldn't
shrink from reappointing the chief if it determines that to be the best
course.</TE>
<TE>   "What we have to communicate as a commission is that this is going to
be done on the merits," he said. "There is a lot more pressure on the
commission today to make that clear, that's for certain."</TE>
<TE>   The panel's decision, which is expected in the next few months, could
be overturned by the City Council, which is already breaking on the issue
along racial lines.</TE>
<TE>   On Tuesday, the three African American members of the council
denounced Hahn's move and said it has badly damaged his relationship with
African American voters.</TE>
<TE>   Councilwoman Jan Perry said her office was flooded with calls from
upset constituents.</TE>
<TE>   "They're angry, and I would expect them to be angry," she said.</TE>
<TE>   By contrast, Hahn's decision was welcomed by the city's police union,
which has campaigned for the chief's ouster and which praised the mayor
for showing "real leadership."</TE>
<TE>   That itself caused some Parks supporters to redouble their concerns.
"It's baffling," said Councilman Mark Ridley-Thomas. "I think the
empowering of the Police Protective League is a huge mistake."</TE>
<TE>   The majority of City Council members refrained from saying how they
intend to handle the matter if it reaches them. But several, including
Councilwoman Janice Hahn, the mayor's sister, said Parks needs to better
address the recent spike in crime.</TE>
<TE>   In the ongoing race to fill the vacant 2nd Council District seat, both
candidates, Assemblyman Tony Cardenas and businesswoman Wendy Greuel,
said they believe Parks should go.</TE>

<HD>Israel Seeks to Turn Iran Into Outcast</HD>
<DH>Mideast: It accuses the Islamic Republic of arming Palestinians and
Lebanon's Hezbollah, and wants other nations to sever ties with Tehran.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARJORIE MILLER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>JERUSALEM
</DL>
<LD>Emboldened by President Bush's "axis of evil" speech, the Israeli
government has launched an international campaign against Iran ahead of
Prime Minister Ariel Sharon's trip to the United States this week.</LD>
<LD>   Israel charges that Iran is arming the Palestinians and Hezbollah, the
Shiite Muslim militia in Lebanon, to further destabilize a region rocked
by more than 16 months of bloodshed. In New York on Monday, Israeli
Foreign Minister Shimon Peres echoed Bush's State of the Union assertion
that Iran is developing weapons of mass destruction.</LD>
<LD>   Iran denied the charges and countered with an unusually strong warning
that any military attack by Israel would be met with "a response that
will be unimaginable to any Israeli politician."</LD>
<TE>   Israeli officials said Tuesday that their campaign is diplomatic, not
military.</TE>
<TE>   "Israel never had and does not have any intention of attacking Iran,"
Transportation Minister Ephraim Sneh, a former deputy defense minister,
told Israel Radio.</TE>
<TE>   Sharon leaves for the United States today and is expected to discuss
Iran and the Palestinian crisis during talks with Bush on Thursday.</TE>
<TE>Letter Being Readied for Israeli Ambassadors</TE>
<TE>   The Foreign Ministry, meanwhile, is preparing a letter for Israeli
ambassadors to present to foreign governments urging them to cut ties
with Iran if it doesn't stop developing missiles and nonconventional
weapons. Israel also wants Iran to withdraw its Revolutionary Guards and
weapons from Lebanon and to refrain from interfering in negotiations to
end the Israeli-Palestinian violence.</TE>
<TE>   "It is essential that we get the point across that the Iranian
government is a wolf in sheep's clothing," an Israeli official said.</TE>
<TE>   Since the Palestinian uprising against Israeli occupation began in
September 2000, Israel has feared a second front: on its northern border
with Lebanon. The neighboring nation is supported by Iran, which doesn't
recognize the Jewish state.</TE>
<TE>   The Israeli government was unsettled by warming ties between
Washington and Tehran after the Sept. 11 terror attacks, when the Bush
administration sought Iran's help in the war against Osama bin Laden's Al
Qaeda network and its hosts, the Taliban regime of Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   The United States and Iran broke off relations in 1979 after Islamic
militants seized the U.S. Embassy in Tehran and held 52 American hostages
for 444 days. But reformist Iranian President Mohammad Khatami has been
working to improve relations with the West, and the United States and
Iran shared an enemy in the Taliban.</TE>
<TE>   Israel worried that Washington might be willing to overlook Iranian
support of Israel's enemies as the U.S. pursued its own foes.</TE>
<TE>   Israeli protests about Iran fell largely on deaf ears until last
month, when Israel intercepted a shipload of weapons in the Red Sea that
it said was supplied by Iran and bound for President Yasser Arafat's
Palestinian Authority.</TE>
<TE>   Iran and the Palestinian Authority have denied any official connection
to the 50-ton arms shipment, but the United States has accepted Israel's
intelligence on the ship, called the Karine-A.</TE>
<TE>   "The Karine-A linked Iran with the intifada [Palestinian uprising] and
has been interpreted as an attempt by Iran to be an actor here," a U.S.
official said.</TE>
<TE>   That view reportedly was reinforced by Jordan's King Abdullah II
during a recent trip to Washington. The London-based Arabic newspaper Al
Sharq al Awsat reported Tuesday that Abdullah presented evidence to Bush
and Secretary of State Colin L. Powell that Iran was "directly and
clearly involved" in at least 17 attempts by the Palestinian militant
groups Hamas and Islamic Jihad to launch missile attacks on Israel from
Jordanian territory.</TE>
<TE>   The paper said Abdullah had confronted Khatami with the reputed
evidence in two heated telephone conversations, during which Khatami said
that he wasn't responsible for the activity against Israel and that
Iranian conservatives were trying to undermine his efforts to change his
country's foreign policy.</TE>
<TE>   The United States, meanwhile, accuses Iran of trying to destabilize
the post-Taliban interim government of Afghanistan by supplying weapons
to a militia commander hostile to the U.S.-backed administration and by
allowing Al Qaeda fighters to escape across its borders.</TE>
<TE>Iran, Lebanon Deny Israel's Allegations</TE>
<TE>   Iran, which has long competed with Pakistan and Russia for influence
in Afghanistan, now apparently fears that the United States will turn
Afghanistan into a permanent base of military operations for Central
Asia.</TE>
<TE>   Bush appeared to give up on closer ties with Tehran in his State of
the Union address last week when he included Iran in an "axis of evil"
along with Iraq and North Korea.</TE>
<TE>   Israel moved quickly to capitalize on the new alignment.</TE>
<TE>   On Monday, Peres accused Iran of supplying thousands of medium-range
missiles to Hezbollah, enabling the group to strike cities deep inside
Israel, and of sending 100 Revolutionary Guards to Lebanon to train the
militia.</TE>
<TE>   Lebanon and Iran denied the charges.</TE>
<TE>   "Israel is very skillful in inventing propagandist stories," Iranian
Foreign Minister Kamal Kharrazi told a news conference in Tehran. "These
allegations are part of the same stories and will not be the last
either."</TE>
<TE>   Hezbollah used Katyusha rockets in a war of attrition against the
22-year Israeli occupation of southern Lebanon until Israel pulled out in
May 2000.</TE>
<TE>   In recent days, Hezbollah has shot antiaircraft missiles at Israeli
fighter jets flying over the border into Lebanese airspace. On Monday,
Israeli schools along the border sent students into bomb shelters when
the militia fired missiles at the planes. No injuries or damage were
caused.</TE>
<TE>   During his trip to the United States, Peres has also called for
international pressure on Iran to abandon a plan to arm itself with
chemical and biological weapons and to pursue nuclear weapons
capabilities.</TE>
<TE>   Fearing that Israel intends to strike a nuclear reactor in Iran, as it
did in Iraq in 1981, Iranian Defense Minister Ali Shamkhani responded on
Qatar's Al Jazeera television Monday night that his government would
respond massively to any Israeli attack.</TE>
<TE>   "If Israel carries out any military action against Iran, it will face
a response that will be unimaginable to any Israeli politician," he said.</TE>

<HD>U.S. Warms to Binding Cuts in Nuclear Arsenals</HD>
<DH>Diplomacy: In a policy shift, Powell says that Washington is
willing to accept Russia's call for a formal deal on reductions in
deployed warheads.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PAUL RICHTER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>Secretary of State Colin L. Powell, in a shift that could open the
way to a new arms deal, signaled Tuesday that the United States is
willing to sign a legally binding agreement with Russia to reduce the
countries' nuclear arsenals.</LD>
<LD>   Both the United States and Russia have pledged to cut their arsenals
from more than 6,000 deployed warheads to between 1,700 and 2,200, but
they have disagreed on whether to make the deal binding.</LD>
<LD>   The Russians have sought a binding written commitment, while American
officials have said they preferred an informal, nonbinding arrangement.</LD>
<TE>   At a hearing of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Powell said
that it was not yet clear whether the agreement would be a treaty or "an
executive agreement" that would be presented to Congress. But he said:
"We do expect it will be legally binding."</TE>
<TE>   Another senior U.S. official, who asked to remain unidentified, said
later that Powell's words marked a shift in U.S. policy.</TE>
<TE>   Powell did not detail the terms of an agreement, and he stopped short
of committing the United States to the irreversible arms cuts that the
Russians have argued are needed. In the Bush administration's view,
setting arms ceilings is a mistake because of the possibility that a new
threat will require a renewed buildup.</TE>
<TE>   Some nuclear arms experts speculated that Powell's statement may mean
that the administration is willing to reduce its arsenal and provide the
Russians information to verify the cuts, but is not willing to pledge
that it won't expand the arsenal later.</TE>
<TE>   This kind of commitment, though short of what they want, would
probably have some value for the Russians, and could be enough to coax
them into a deal, some analysts said.</TE>
<TE>   Joseph Cirincione, an arms expert at the Carnegie Endowment for
International Peace in Washington, said that while the Russians want
"deep, irreversible, verifiable cuts, they might be willing to settle for
fairly deep verifiable cuts."</TE>
<TE>   However, another arms expert argued that unless the United States
commits itself to irreversible cuts, the deal will have little value for
the Russians.</TE>
<TE>   Removing warheads from its missiles, as the United States has
promised, "is a move in the right direction," said Tom Collina of the
Union of Concerned Scientists, a group that favors arms control. Yet
unless the United States commits itself to keep its arsenal smaller, the
Russians will not feel safe cutting back, "and you won't have bought as
much security as you could," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Negotiators for the two countries have held talks recently in hopes of
reaching an agreement that Russian President Vladimir V. Putin and
President Bush could sign when Bush visits Russia this summer.</TE>
<TE>   Powell's comments came late in the day Russian time, and Russian
officials had no immediate public comment. But the Itar-Tass news agency
Monday quoted a Russian diplomatic source saying that "it is quite
possible to prepare quickly a new agreement on strategic offensive
weapons and strategic stability."</TE>

<HD>Pakistan Calls for International Mediation in Kashmir Conflict</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GEOFFREY MOHAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>MUZAFFARABAD, Pakistan
</DL>
<LD>Rejecting the military brinkmanship that has lately marked
relations with India, Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf on Tuesday
appealed to the international community, "particularly certain
influential countries," to help resolve the crisis over the disputed
Kashmir region.</LD>
<LD>   Musharraf criticized what he called India's "cynical response" to his
recent overtures to open face-to-face negotiations on the border conflict
with Indian Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee. But the president also
pledged to make "no more concessions" on the issue during a speech before
local legislators in the Pakistan-controlled part of Kashmir.</LD>
<LD>   The two nuclear-armed countries have been amassing troops on their
border since December, throwing regional stability into question at a
time when the U.S. is counting on Pakistan as a close ally in its war on
terrorism in neighboring Afghanistan.</LD>
<TE>   "Instead of engaging in brinkmanship, Prime Minister Vajpayee should
accept my invitation for dialogue for the peaceful resolution of the
Kashmir dispute as well as all other issues," Musharraf said in the
speech, which marked Kashmir Solidarity Day, a national holiday.</TE>
<TE>   "I also take this opportunity to call upon the government of India to
take steps to end repression in Kashmir," he said. "I know the Indian
leadership had said once that if we take one step, they will take two
steps. We have taken steps. We still await steps taken by the Indians."</TE>
<TE>   Reaction from New Delhi was swift and negative. Indian Foreign
Ministry spokeswoman Nirupama Rao accused Musharraf of resorting to
"time-worn and untenable positions" and qualified his comments as
"interference in the internal affairs of India."</TE>
<TE>   Peace overtures aside, Musharraf's speech was peppered with militantly
patriotic terms typical of the bitter holiday marking the conflict that
arose when the British partitioned the subcontinent into the secular
republic of India and the Muslim nation of Pakistan. The Hindu ruler of
predominantly Muslim Kashmir opted to join India, sparking a
confrontation that has launched two wars and left tens of thousands of
casualties.</TE>
<TE>   Musharraf's mention of "certain influential countries" to help mediate
a solution was taken by observers as an allusion to the United
States--and as a reminder of Pakistan's cooperative stance in the
U.S.-led war against terrorist groups. The Bush administration has
rejected any role as mediator in the Kashmir dispute.</TE>
<TE>   Last month, in a landmark national speech, Musharraf announced a ban
on five Islamic extremist groups, some of which are listed as terror
organizations by the Bush administration.</TE>
<TE>   But a state legislator reminded Musharraf that one nation's terror
group may be another's freedom fighters, a refrain that is beginning to
resonate internationally as the U.S. expands its anti-terror effort to
the Philippines and elsewhere.</TE>
<TE>   "India has tried to link up the indigenous struggle in Kashmir . . .
with Al Qaeda and the Taliban, but the fact is, there is a state of
terror on the part of the government of India against the innocent and
unarmed people of Kashmir," Sultan Mahmood Choudhry, a local opposition
leader, told the president before his speech.</TE>
<TE>   India sees itself locked in a battle against Pakistan-backed terrorism
over the disputed land. It has blamed Islamic militants based in Pakistan
for a bloody Dec. 13 attack on the Parliament building in New Delhi.</TE>
<TE>   Musharraf defended himself against recent domestic criticism that his
call for a "moderate, democratic and progressive Islamic welfare state"
was little more than a recognition that he needed to choose sides in the
U.S. war on terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   "Let me make it clear that I did not resort to these measures under
any kind of pressure or to appease anybody, and I mean every word of
this," Musharraf said, returning to the theme repeatedly.</TE>
<TE>   The half-hour speech, given in English rather than Urdu, the official
national language, was aimed at an international audience. But Musharraf
shifted to Urdu for several minutes at the end, saying his presidency,
which he wrested in a bloodless coup in 1999, was "bestowed on me by God
almighty."</TE>
<TE>   The holiday was marked by a moment of silence, parades, protests and
television footage of Pakistani victims of the Kashmir conflict. On the
streets of Muzaffarabad, a banner read: "The Fragrance of Freedom Cannot
be Captivated by Barbed Wires." It was strung near a model of a missile
pointed toward India.</TE>

<HD>China Warns U.S. Over Taiwan Ties</HD>
<DH>Asia: Beijing voices concern that Washington might change its
policy to more overt backing of the island's leader.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HENRY CHU</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>BEIJING
</DL>
<LD>A top Chinese official warned the United States on Tuesday against
giving Taiwan greater political support but at the same time stressed
that Beijing is willing to be more flexible toward the island's
independence-minded ruling party.</LD>
<LD>   Just two weeks before President Bush is to make his first state visit
to China, the senior official expressed deep concern that Washington
might swap its historically ambiguous policy toward Taiwan for more overt
backing of Taiwanese President Chen Shui-bian's government, which Beijing
distrusts.</LD>
<LD>   In particular, the official cited remarks last month by the top U.S.
envoy to Taipei, Richard Bush, who said the U.S. would "help Taiwan
defend itself" if threatened. The envoy also appeared to criticize
Beijing's insistence on the "one China" principle, which holds that China
and Taiwan belong to one nation. China maintains that talks with Taiwan
must be based on that idea.</LD>
<TE>   "He went too far," the official said of the envoy, speaking to a small
group of foreign reporters on condition of anonymity.</TE>
<TE>   The Chinese official added that such comments would serve only to
embolden Chen--whose party officially advocates Taiwanese
independence--and would be "outrageous" and dangerous if they signaled an
actual shift in U.S. policy.</TE>
<TE>   The dust-up is certain to arise in talks between Chinese President
Jiang Zemin and President Bush during the U.S. leader's Feb. 21-22 visit.
Controversies over Taiwan have vexed Sino-U.S. ties ever since the two
countries established diplomatic relations in 1979.</TE>
<TE>   The senior Chinese official welcomed the president's visit and
credited him with trying to build trust with the Chinese people after the
Sept. 11 terrorist attacks in the U.S.</TE>
<TE>   But he said that the Bush administration and U.S. lawmakers must pay
more than "lip service" to longtime American assurances not to encourage
Taiwanese independence. He also said Washington should stop selling
advanced weapons to Taipei--sales that deepen Chinese fears of a military
alliance between the U.S. and Taiwan.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, the two sides of the narrow Taiwan Strait must be allowed to
work out their differences on their own, as a purely "domestic" affair,
the official said.</TE>
<TE>   "If you look at Taiwan as the 51st state, in the long run it will be a
problem for the United States," he warned. "Please don't forget that
Taiwan is a cross-strait issue."</TE>
<TE>   In a wide-ranging, two-hour interview, the official clearly sought to
underscore Beijing's new, more relaxed attitude toward Taiwan's ruling
party, a departure from the vitriol flung at Chen when he won the
presidency two years ago.</TE>
<TE>   Then, the Communist regime repeatedly threatened to use force to
reunify Taiwan with the mainland. The official said such declarations
were necessary to scare Chen's Democratic Progressive Party, or DPP, away
from its pro-independence stance. But he acknowledged that "it's not the
best way" to conduct cross-strait relations--the first such public
pronouncement from a high-ranking Chinese official.</TE>
<TE>   Two weeks ago, Vice Premier Qian Qichen also surprised China-watchers
by saying that the mainland is willing to meet with moderate members of
the DPP, whom Qian differentiated from "die-hard" independence advocates.</TE>
<TE>   The senior Chinese official interviewed Tuesday described Beijing's
thaw as a result of a shift by the DPP toward the center since Chen took
office. The official denied that it sprang from alarm over the DPP's
surprisingly large gains in legislative elections in December. "The
reversal is very much . . . because they moved" away from declaring
independence, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Beijing's softer tone also reflects the mainland's increasing
confidence that its economic importance to Taiwan has strengthened its
hand while tying those of Taiwan's leaders. Taiwanese investment across
the strait has soared in recent years as many island companies have moved
operations to the mainland to take advantage of cheap and plentiful
labor.</TE>
<TE>   The mainland can afford to be patient for Taiwan to reconcile, the
official said. In the meantime, Beijing has dropped references to the
island as "a province" of China. It also has broadened its definition of
the "one China" principle and does not emphasize which side is superior.</TE>
<TE>   But Beijing remains adamant that Taiwan must accept the "one China"
principle as a starting point for any talks.</TE>
<TE>   Taipei is cool toward the idea, but the DPP cautiously welcomed the
offer to meet with mainland officials. No one, however, seems to know how
such a meeting would work.</TE>

<HD>Nigeria Moves to Quell Ethnic Violence</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>LAGOS, Nigeria
</DL>
<LD>Nigerian soldiers kicked in doors and interrogated kneeling
suspects at gunpoint in a Lagos slum Tuesday to stamp out ethnic clashes
that have killed at least 100 people in four days.</LD>
<LD>   The stench of rotting and burned flesh hung in the air, and dozens of
charred bodies littered the streets of the Mushin district.</LD>
<LD>   Authorities in Nigeria's biggest city suggested that the clashes
between gangs wielding bows and arrows, guns and machetes might have been
engineered to create instability that could lead to an attempt to restore
military rule.</LD>
<TE>   Pitted against each other in the violence were Nigeria's main tribal
rivals: Hausas, whose origins lie in the mainly Muslim north; and
Yorubas, from the more heavily Christian and animist southwest, around
Lagos.</TE>
<TE>   "As of now, you can say 100 have been confirmed dead. About 430 have
been wounded," Nigerian Red Cross President Emmanuel Ijewere said as he
helped bring about 3,000 people who had fled Mushin to a temporary camp.</TE>
<TE>   Many homes in the area were torched and looted. "Everything I've
labored for over 20 years has been destroyed. Now I have only this shirt
and these trousers that I'm wearing," said Segun Ifelade, a Yoruba
businessman.</TE>
<TE>   Lagos State Police Commissioner Mike Okiro said 10 people had been
detained.</TE>
<TE>   After outbreaks of violence elsewhere in Lagos, troops and police were
on alert to stop trouble from spreading. Soldiers were also on standby in
northern Nigeria as the riots raised tension across Africa's most
populous nation.</TE>
<TE>   The violence was the latest in a series of deadly clashes since army
rule ended in 1999, and it was a stark reminder of Nigeria's fragility as
it gears up for a general election next year.</TE>
<TE>   Nigeria has routinely used the army to put down ethnic disturbances,
which have killed thousands since President Olusegun Obasanjo took office
in 1999 to end a 15-year spell of corrupt and oppressive military rule.</TE>

<HD>Argentine Hopes Rest on Economic Rescue Program</HD>
<DH>Latin America: New banking regulations go into effect today. The
dollar will no longer be valid currency for any transaction.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HECTOR TOBAR</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>BUENOS AIRES
</DL>
<LD>The government of Argentina will launch its program to rescue the
country's troubled economy today, after a month of political wrangling,
meetings with the high priests of global finance and a constitutional
crisis or two.</LD>
<LD>   A series of new banking regulations is scheduled to take effect today,
a day after the government presented its 2002 budget to Congress.
Together, the measures form the heart of President Eduardo Duhalde's plan
to pull his country out of its economic wreckage.</LD>
<LD>   The success or failure of the plan could determine the fate of
Duhalde, who came to power Jan. 2 in the wake of violent demonstrations
that drove Fernando de la Rua from power. Now Duhalde faces a similar
whirlwind of political intrigue and street protests, forces that threaten
to consume the nation's fragile democratic institutions.</LD>
<TE>   "If there is no order, there is no democracy," Duhalde said Tuesday in
response to criticism that he has concentrated too much power in his
hands. "A president who has authority is not the same as an authoritarian
president. . . . The people will not tolerate anarchy."</TE>
<TE>   On Monday, the government issued a decree ordering all banks to sell
their dollars to the Central Bank in exchange for Argentine pesos. A
decade-long effort to shore up the value of the peso against the dollar
had driven the country to the brink of bankruptcy.</TE>
<TE>   As of today, the dollar will no longer be valid currency for any
transaction. That in itself is a monumental transformation in a country
where more than two-thirds of bank deposits have been in greenbacks.</TE>
<TE>   Officials fear that the value of the peso could fall precipitously.
That drop could in turn provoke the high rates of inflation last seen
here in the 1980s, a time of instability that still traumatizes the
nation.</TE>
<TE>Billions in Reserves to Prop Up the Peso</TE>
<TE>   For more than a decade, the peso has been equivalent to a dollar. Last
month, the government established an official exchange rate of 1.4 to the
dollar. Now the peso will float at a single rate of exchange, determined
by the market.</TE>
<TE>   A government spokesman said Duhalde's administration has $14 billion
in reserves to prop up the peso, which some analysts fear may soon be
worth as little as 33 cents.</TE>
<TE>   The government had imposed a two-day banking holiday as an emergency
measure. Late Tuesday, officials decided to keep some functions shut down
today, including currency exchange.</TE>
<TE>   No one knows, exactly, what will happen once banks and exchange houses
open.</TE>
<TE>   "It's going to be a war here," one currency trader said in the heart
of the Buenos Aires banking district, known as "La City." "If the Central
Bank doesn't step in quickly and decisively [to support the peso], this
will become chaos."</TE>
<TE>   These are days of reckoning in Argentina, with more than just the
economy at stake. The past few weeks have seen an ugly tug of war and
settling of accounts among the nation's political elite.</TE>
<TE>   Former Economics Minister Domingo Cavallo has been subpoenaed to
testify before a federal judge investigating his actions in the last days
of the De la Rua administration. The former police chief of Buenos Aires
has been subpoenaed too, in connection with the deaths of several
protesters gunned down by police during the rioting that brought down De
la Rua.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, a majority of Supreme Court justices are facing
impeachment by Congress.</TE>
<TE>   On Friday, those same justices ruled that a key element of the
government's economic program was unconstitutional--a strict limit on
bank withdrawals that is preventing many depositors from getting all
their money until 2003 or 2004.</TE>
<TE>   The justices, most of whom were appointed by former President Carlos
Menem, are facing charges of cronyism and corruption. Menem has been
sharply critical of Duhalde since the latter took power, and many
observers saw Menem's hand behind the court's ruling.</TE>
<TE>   "I am not a weak president," Duhalde said, responding to the court's
ruling in a nationwide address Friday evening. He charged the justices
with trying to "blackmail" his government.</TE>
<TE>'There Is a Conflict Between Powers Here'</TE>
<TE>   The court action would have allowed depositors to withdraw all of
their savings, threatening at least three banks with collapse. But the
government, which has increasingly ruled by special decree, ordered that
no one could enforce the court's judgment for six months.</TE>
<TE>   Some constitutional scholars bristled at Duhalde's actions.</TE>
<TE>   "There is a conflict between powers here, and we don't know for sure
if the constitution is still in force," said Eduardo Barcerat, a
constitutional lawyer. "I wonder if the constitution is capable of
surviving another attack against it."</TE>
<TE>   Duhalde's government also finds itself under enormous pressure to
address the social ills caused by five years of recession. Unemployment
stands at 20%, according to a report released last month.</TE>
<TE>   Every day appears to bring a new form of demonstration. On Tuesday,
poultry producers set loose dozens of chickens in front of government
offices in the city of Mendoza and called for government subsidies.</TE>
<TE>   In recent weeks, unemployed workers have blocked roads throughout the
country. On Tuesday, 2,000 jobless protesters marched through downtown
Buenos Aires to the Pink House, the seat of government.</TE>
<TE>   "We want our unemployment insurance--or real jobs," said Paula Quasi,
29, who has been out of work for more than a year. "The [last] government
promised us 1 million new jobs, and nothing happened."</TE>
<TE>   Duhalde, in contrast to De la Rua, has portrayed himself as a man
deeply concerned about the problems of ordinary Argentines. Portraits of
the president almost invariably show him with his hands clasped in front
of his face in a pose of deep worry, as if in prayer.</TE>
<TE>   Several times each week, he takes questions on a radio program called
"Speaking With the President." Last week, he met with representatives of
15,000 unemployed workers who had blocked roads and marched on the Pink
House.</TE>
<TE>   "If I were in your position," he told the marchers, "I'd be blocking
the highways too."</TE>

<HD>U.S. Plan Aims to Stem Pipeline's Flow of Trouble</HD>
<DH>Colombia: White House proposes $98-million aid package to help
Bogota combat rebel attacks on Cano Limon artery.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RUTH MORRIS</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL>ARAUCA, Colombia
</DL>
<LD>It may have been the damp in the earth seeping into the bomb, or a
faulty connection. Alex Ramirez is convinced it was the five amulets he
wears around his neck. But for some reason, when he stepped on a rebel
land mine three months ago, he survived the blast.</LD>
<LD>   "The lights went out. I couldn't see or hear anything," the
25-year-old bomb expert recalled. "It felt as if I had something on my
face. I thought it was blood, but it was oil."</LD>
<LD>   As a member of a six-person anti-explosives army unit that patrols
Occidental Petroleum Corp.'s Cano Limon pipeline here, Ramirez has signed
up for one of the most dangerous jobs in Colombia: protecting oil
shipments to the United States.</LD>
<TE>   For nearly two decades, Cano Limon has been a target of leftist
guerrillas, who have blown so many holes in the Atlantic-bound pipeline
that locals call it "the flute." With the pipeline's output reduced to a
trickle by 13 blasts this year alone, the Bush administration stepped
into the fray this week, unveiling a $98-million budget request to help
the Colombian army thwart the attacks.</TE>
<TE>   The plan would probably involve surveillance equipment and helicopter
support, senior Bush administration officials said, and could take U.S.
military assistance to a new level in Colombia's bloody 38-year civil
war.</TE>
<TE>   Until now, the U.S. has limited military assistance to Colombia's war
on drugs, steering clear of direct involvement in what many consider a
dead-end power struggle among Marxist rebels--most notably the
Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC--ultra-right paramilitary
groups and the government.</TE>
<TE>   "We're not saying this is counter-narcotics funding. It's not. It's
different," said an administration official who visited Bogota, the
Colombian capital, as part of a U.S. delegation Tuesday. "The proposition
that we are making to the government of Colombia, and to our Congress, is
that we ought to take an additional step."</TE>
<TE>   Other U.S. officials said the budget request is merely part of the
United States' broader effort to foster democracy and the rule of law in
Colombia.</TE>
<TE>   In Washington, State Department official Curt Struble said the rebel
attacks, by closing down the pipeline for 243 days last year, had "a very
significant impact on Colombian exports" and on the government's ability
to generate money needed for economic growth.</TE>
<TE>   In a briefing with reporters, he said the United States can
legitimately help the Colombian military for "specific missions and
objectives," as it already does in trying to fight narcotics traffic and
kidnapping.</TE>
<TE>   Colombian military officers in the field said their troops would
welcome U.S. aid, but they noted that the Cano Limon pipeline, which
serves Los Angeles-based Occidental, traverses 480 miles of wild frontier
and is virtually indefensible without improved surveillance techniques.
The pipeline is Colombia's second-largest and has a capacity to pump
240,000 barrels a day--when it's functioning.</TE>
<TE>   Along the Venezuelan border where the pipeline begins, for instance,
cattle rustlers and drug traffickers operate alongside three rebel fronts
and the fiercely independent Uwa tribe. The region is such a tinderbox of
illicit activity that local police can barely venture from their station
houses without risking an ambush.</TE>
<TE>   For the army troops patrolling the Cano Limon, the odds aren't much
better.</TE>
<TE>   "I know right now the enemy is close," Capt. Harold Rodriguez said as
his counterinsurgency troops fanned into the sun-scorched pastures
surrounding the site of a recent pipeline blast. "They either launch gas
cylinders at us, or mine the area, or ambush us. Sometimes they blow up
the tube just to lure us in."</TE>
<TE>   Working nearby, Ramirez's anti-explosives crew crouched close to the
ground, gingerly lifting clods of dirt on knife edges. The trip wires the
team looks for are so thin, he said, there isn't enough light to see them
after 4 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   The pipeline's unique and hazardous work conditions also make for
extremely fast repairs. Once an area is secured, engineers, cooks and
laborers are whisked in by helicopter and usually have the pipeline
working again within 13 hours.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not trained for this," chief engineer Alvaro Betancur said,
referring to rebel ambushes that sometimes await his repair crews. Since
his team came under fire during a job late last year, he added, "I think
about my family. It makes me feel like throwing in the towel sometimes."</TE>
<TE>   The rebels' bombing campaign, which has escalated during a critical
phase in peace talks with the government, has raised huge environmental
and financial concerns too. Government figures show that 2.5 million
barrels of spilled Cano Limon crude have oozed into Colombia's rivers and
ranges during the last 15 years--about 10 times the volume of the 1989
Exxon Valdez oil spill in Alaska.</TE>
<TE>   Cattle drinking from the poisoned streams lose weight, locals say,
while spills have clogged and blackened pristine swimming holes.</TE>
<TE>   What's more, the cash-strapped Colombian government has an 85% stake
in Cano Limon's output, and lost production is costing it hundreds of
millions of dollars. The idling of the pipeline for two-thirds of 2001
led to a budget shortfall of nearly $500 million.</TE>
<TE>   "The breeze brings this smell of oil, and it gives me a headache,"
said Otilia Espitia, the owner of a small farm near the pipeline. Espitia
said she didn't mind the swarm of soldiers who were camped out among
canary cages and laundry lines in her front yard, but she worried that
her well water would be contaminated as the ground absorbed a gooey black
slick forming just 50 feet away. She also pointed to several cracks along
the walls of her home as testimony to earlier bomb blasts.</TE>
<TE>   "I'd like to leave this area, but no one will buy this land," she
said.</TE>
<TE>   Downstream from Espitia's home, in the fishing hamlet of Puerto
Lleras, every canoe was ringed by a strip of crude.</TE>
<TE>   "We haven't been able to fish for two weeks, because the nets get
ruined with the oil," catfish vendor Ciro Antonio Agudelo said as he
scrubbed down his boat. Asked if he was angry with the rebels for causing
the pollution, he glanced sideways before replying, "What does it achieve
to get angry?"</TE>
<TE>   "The FARC are looking for peace--in quotation marks--but they're
making war," Lt. Col. Emilio Enrique Torres said of the tired peace
process between the rebels and government negotiators, now in its third
year. As the head of the 49th Battalion, which has lost 63 men trying to
safeguard the pipeline, Torres is accompanied by a soldier carrying an
automatic rifle every morning as he jogs around his barracks.</TE>
<TE>   Torres said the FARC is displaying its military might ahead of an
April 7 deadline to set terms for a cease-fire agreement. Besides hitting
the pipeline, FARC fighters have toppled electricity pylons, knocked out
bridges and parked bicycle bombs on busy city streets in an effort to tie
the country's infrastructure in knots.</TE>
<TE>   "They want to weaken the state and impose their own conditions at the
[peace] table," Torres said. However, he stopped short of ruling out a
secondary, financial motive.</TE>
<TE>   The rebels have long sought a dialogue with Occidental managers,
presumably to arrange for the company to pay them "vaccines," or
extortion payments. Occidental insists that it will never acquiesce to
such demands.</TE>
<TE>   Farther downriver, Arauca, the capital of Arauca state, is also
reeling from the pipeline sabotage. Local officials rely heavily on oil
royalties to meet budget demands, so every new round of bombings
translates into salary freezes for teachers and layoffs for construction
workers.</TE>
<TE>   "Arauca is dead. The oil has been lost," grocer Fredy Rodrigo Tovar
said as he served cold sodas to customers. "First there was unemployment,
and now people are robbing to eat."</TE>
<TE>   Like others, Tovar complained that revenue from the region's "black
gold" had mostly lined the pockets of corrupt politicians. The city
abounds with white-elephant building projects, such as a flooded
velodrome for bicycle races, known locally as "the monument to cement."</TE>
<TE>   Yet the local hospital has no money to maintain its ambulances. All
three are out of service.</TE>
<TE>   "We were unprepared," former Gov. Hector Federico Gallardo said. "If
you're poor and uneducated and you win the biggest lottery in history,
you won't administer the money well."</TE>
<TE>   Speaking privately, locals say that the rebels have been plundering
regional government coffers too, pressing officials to use contractors
with guerrilla links and methodically "taxing" government-sponsored
projects.</TE>
<TE>   With or without U.S. military aid to protect the Cano Limon pipeline,
they say, it is unclear how the Colombian government can cut off Arauca's
entrenched rebel factions from millions of dollars in oil revenue. Until
the government takes on the task, Arauca's residents are likely to remain
as impoverished as ever.</TE>
<TE>   Back at the Cano Limon field, an officer who requested anonymity waved
toward a wall of oil barrels painted in camouflage, forming a barricade
around a small statue of the Virgin Mary.</TE>
<TE>   "I have her well protected," he said. "But as long as a young guy is
hungry, [he'll join the rebels] and come after you. If there were more
schools, more roads, more jobs, we wouldn't have to be here."</TE>
<TE>   Times staff writer Paul Richter in Washington contributed to this
report.</TE>

<HD>Police Optimistic Reporter Is Alive</HD>
<DH>Pakistan: Officials in Karachi say a major break in American's
abduction is near. More suspects are detained.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TYLER MARSHALL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>ISLAMABAD, Pakistan
</DL>
<LD>Police investigating the kidnapping of U.S. journalist Daniel Pearl
voiced growing optimism Tuesday that the Wall Street Journal reporter is
still alive and that they are nearing a major break in the case.</LD>
<LD>   Still, authorities in the port city of Karachi, where Pearl
disappeared Jan. 23, declined to comment in any detail on the reason for
their new confidence.</LD>
<LD>   "There's been no breakthrough yet, but we're moving in the right
direction," said Tariq Jamil, deputy inspector general of police for
Karachi.</LD>
<TE>   In a telephone interview, Jamil said "new suspects" were detained
Tuesday in connection with the case, but he indicated that they aren't
believed to be central players in the abduction.</TE>
<TE>   A senior police officer who declined to be identified described the
newly detained suspects as two men, both believed to be members of the
Islamic militant group Jaish-e-Mohammed. The group is one of five
extremist organizations banned last month by Pakistan's president, Gen.
Pervez Musharraf, as part of a nationwide crackdown.</TE>
<TE>   Jaish-e-Mohammed has been linked with terrorist activities related to
the Kashmir dispute between Pakistan and India, including a Dec. 13
attack on the Indian Parliament and a December 1999 hijacking of an
Indian Airlines plane to Kandahar, Afghanistan. The hijackers won the
release of three of the group's leaders, including a man named Sheik
Ahmad Omar Sayed.</TE>
<TE>   The senior police officer said investigators believe that
Jaish-e-Mohammed as a group, or some senior figures within it, including
Sayed, may be linked to the kidnapping.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities are concentrating on three figures in the kidnapping case,
at least two of whom may have been intermediaries for Pearl in arranging
an interview with Sheik Mubarak Ali Shah Gilani, head of another
fundamentalist Islamic group, Jamaat ul-Fuqra.</TE>
<TE>   Pearl believed he had uncovered a link between Gilani and Richard C.
Reid, who is accused of trying to blow up a Miami-bound aircraft by
detonating explosives in his shoes.</TE>
<TE>   Pearl was known to be seeking an interview with Gilani at the time of
his disappearance.</TE>
<TE>   Police investigators said Tuesday that they had traced the Inter net
service provider used by the kidnappers to send their e-mail list of
political demands and threats to kill Pearl if those demands were not
met. Police are searching for the terminals that actually transmitted the
two e-mails.</TE>
<TE>   A few days ago, investigators dismissed as hoaxes a flurry of other
e-mails, including one declaring that Pearl had been killed.</TE>

<HD>15 of Sept. 11 Suspects Were Citizens, Saudis Say</HD>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>RIYADH, Saudi Arabia
</DL>
<LD>The government acknowledged for the first time today that 15 of the
19 Sept. 11 hijacking suspects were Saudi citizens.</LD>
<LD>   "The names that we got confirmed that," Interior Minister Prince Nayif
ibn Abdulaziz said. "Their families have been notified."</LD>
<LD>   Saudi Arabia previously said the citizenship of the 15 suspects was in
doubt despite U.S. insistence that they were Saudis.</LD>
<TE>   Osama bin Laden, the chief suspect in the attacks, was born in Saudi
Arabia but was stripped of his citizenship in 1994.</TE>
<TE>   Asked if he had information on whether Bin Laden was alive, Nayif
said: "We have no information, and we have no interest in this subject."</TE>
<TE>   Nayif said the kingdom has detained about 30 people since the attacks,
based on lists provided by the United States. Some have been released. He
said the men still in detention "have been influenced by Bin Laden's
thinking."</TE>
<TE>   "It's possible that we will find among them members of the [Al Qaeda]
organization," Nayif added. "But so far we haven't found anything."</TE>
<TE>   He said the Saudi leadership was shocked to learn that 15 of the
suspected hijackers were from the kingdom, and he said it was natural
that the nation had not noticed their involvement beforehand.</TE>
<TE>   "I believe they were taken advantage of in the name of religion and
regarding certain issues pertaining to the Arab nation, especially the
issue of Palestine," he said.</TE>

<DL>MAZAR-I-SHARIF, Afghanistan
</DL>
<LD>Wearing bright red insignia, members of a new government-backed
security force expanded patrols Tuesday in northern Afghanistan's biggest
city in a move to bring stability to the volatile region.</LD>
<LD>   Thousands of motley dressed militiamen still prowl the streets of
Mazar-i-Sharif with Kalashnikov rifles and rocket-propelled grenades, but
under the accord creating the force, the region's main warlords are to
withdraw their forces from Mazar-i-Sharif and demobilize all but a few of
the fighters.</LD>
<LD>   A pullout by warlords would be an important step in Afghanistan's
efforts to restore stability after 23 years of fighting. Factional
violence continues to break out two months after the fall of the Taliban,
and even when there is no shooting, tensions are high among factions
jockeying for control.</LD>
<TE>   Talks continued Tuesday on resolving tensions in the eastern town of
Gardez, where two days of factional fighting last week killed at least 61
people.</TE>
<TE>   Ending such conflicts is key to interim Prime Minister Hamid Karzai's
attempts to solidify his government's authority. Afghanistan has no
national army, and an international peacekeeping force is limited to
Kabul, the capital.</TE>
<TE>   On Tuesday, Karzai said in a televised address that the outbursts of
fighting are led by people who "want to sabotage the security of
Afghanistan," adding "all those efforts will fail."</TE>
<TE>   The Mazar-i-Sharif withdrawal was expected to begin Tuesday but was
postponed until Gen. Abdul Rashid Dostum, leader of one of the main
militias and the country's deputy defense minister, returns from abroad.
But several key Dostum aides said his faction supports the agreement.</TE>
<TE>   The security force leader picked by the interim government, Gen.
Mohammad Isa Eftakhouri, said he hopes to have the militias out of the
city within 10 days, after which the task of disarming civilians will
begin.</TE>
<TE>   The security force is to include men from each of the region's three
main militias--Dostum's, his rival Ata Mohammed's and a third faction
under Haji Mohammed Mukhaqiq. Each represents a different ethnic or
cultural group.</TE>
<TE>   Whether that participation will ensure that the militia commanders
demobilize and disarm their tens of thousands of fighters is "our major
worry," Eftakhouri said.</TE>
<TE>   Late Tuesday, Kabul television reported that Karzai's administration
had restored the 1964 constitution of former King Mohammad Zaher Shah.</TE>

<HD>A Staircase Race to Remember</HD>
<DH>Run: Annual Empire State Building contest to dash up 1,576 steps
becomes a way to honor those who died in the World Trade Center.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN J. GOLDMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As Fire Capt. Jim Morgan raced with the pack up the narrow
stairwell to the 86th floor of the Empire State Building on Tuesday, he
flashed back to other stifling staircases and another race.</LD>
<LD>   "I was just trying to think of the guys you knew personally, from the
youngest guy to the most experienced--the chief of the department we
lost," he said of Sept. 11. "I thought, don't give up. These guys didn't
quit. They were still running in the building trying to recover
civilians."</LD>
<LD>   For 24 years, the Empire State Building Run-Up has been a quirky
sporting event, a mad dash up 1,576 steps to the observation deck,
attracting marathoners, mountain runners and people who just like to
climb stairs.</LD>
<TE>   "It's not only wacky, it's tough," said Richard Finn, a spokesman for
the New York Road Runners Club, organizers of the event.</TE>
<TE>   But on its silver anniversary, the annual race emerged as something
more poignant: a proud tribute to the victims--including 343
firefighters--of the terrorist attack on the World Trade Center.</TE>
<TE>   After the twin 110-story towers collapsed, the Empire State Building,
with 102 floors, became New York's tallest skyscraper.</TE>
<TE>   As runners gathered in the lobby of the structure on Fifth Avenue in
mid-Manhattan, the theme was red, white and blue.</TE>
<TE>   Some contestants wore shirts decorated with American flags. Others
carried the patriotic motif to shorts and leotards.</TE>
<TE>   The Road Runners Club said many of the more than 180 people who signed
up noted on their applications that Sept. 11 was a motivating factor.</TE>
<TE>   They said that running was a way of showing support for the city and
its heroes.</TE>
<TE>   The club said some people, especially members of a competing team of
police officers and firefighters, added an additional thought on the
form: They were running to honor friends and loved ones who perished at
the trade center site.</TE>
<TE>   "This year, we ran with heavy hearts for obvious reasons," said Ken
Bohan, also a member of the fire department's stair-climbing team.</TE>
<TE>   The fact that the race went on despite the tragedy of Sept. 11
"offered the world more confidence," said Paul Crake, 25, an accountant
from Australia who won the men's race in 9 minutes and 40 seconds.</TE>
<TE>   Kerstin Harbich, 27, of Garmisch, Germany, finished first among the
women with a time of 12 minutes and 46 seconds. "I feel good," she said
after the climb.</TE>
<TE>   "It's just a sign New York is returning to some type of normalcy,"
Crake added. It was his fourth straight victory.</TE>
<TE>   Bohan, 39, who works in a firehouse in Brooklyn and who finished first
among firefighters and police officers, said he thought the event gave
the runners a chance to focus on something positive.</TE>
<TE>   "In some small way, I think we did that," he said. "People showed up.
Nobody was afraid of anything, and people came from all over the world to
run in this race."</TE>
<TE>   Bohan received a check for $2,500 from FleetBoston Financial, sponsors
of the race. He said the money would go to a fund established for the
children of a firefighter he worked with who was killed when the twin
towers collapsed.</TE>
<TE>   He and Morgan, 43, stressed that five months later, firefighters at
the site are still trying to recover the bodies of all their comrades.</TE>
<TE>   "There are guys digging as we speak," Bohan said. "Hopefully, they
will be finding some of the brothers today."</TE>
<TE>   Despite the sad memories of the trade center, most of the climbers saw
the event as a fun run in the middle of winter.</TE>
<TE>   Evelyn Davis, 64, who wore a red leotard, said about a month before
the competition she started running up the stairs in her apartment
building in Cliffside Park, N.J.--three sets of 30 flights, three times a
week. "I also started weight training, so that helps a little bit, I
think."</TE>
<TE>   Verena Hoeppli, 43, said she began climbing stairs in her Manhattan
high-rise apartment building every day as part of her fitness routine.</TE>
<TE>   "Then I decided, why not go up the entire distance. In my building
there are 40 floors. I do it three times a day--40 floors."</TE>
<TE>   As for finally crossing the finish line, she said: "By the 50th floor,
you are hoping it will be over."</TE>
<TE>   Ruth Fairbrother, 59, an accountant and a former long-distance runner,
said she didn't train specially for the event.</TE>
<TE>   "My husband said, 'Don't bother. Either you're fit or you're not fit.
If you're fit, you can do it."'</TE>

<HD>Daniels Apologizes for Comments</HD>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>White House Budget Director Mitchell E. Daniels Jr. said Tuesday he
regrets saying New York lawmakers' efforts to get federal money for Sept.
11-related costs were like "a little money-grubbing game."</LD>
<LD>   Daniels told the Senate Budget Committee he made a poor choice of
words.</LD>
<LD>   "I remember when Winston Churchill once said that he frequently had to
eat his words and in general he found it a wholesome diet," Daniels said.
"I regret that my comments were misconstrued."</LD>
<TE>   Daniels made the "money-grubbing" comment Monday while discussing
federal efforts to aid New York City. He upset New York lawmakers when he
said $5 billion from a federal compensation fund for Sept. 11 victims
would be counted toward the $20 billion that President Bush promised New
York.</TE>
<TE>   At Tuesday's hearing, Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton (D-N.Y.) pressed
Daniels, who said he believes New York will get more than $20 billion.</TE>

<HD>N.Y. Charity Scandal Leads to Indictments</HD>
<DH>Crime: Ex-leader of a famed Harlem children's shelter and her
husband are charged with larceny and forgery.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOSH GETLIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK
</DL>
<LD>Lorraine Hale, the former head of a nationally known Harlem charity
for children, was indicted Tuesday along with her husband for allegedly
misappropriating more than $700,000 in donations meant to care for the
abandoned children of drug-addicted mothers.</LD>
<LD>   The ousted charity leaders, who pleaded not guilty to the charges
during a brief court appearance, were also hit with a state lawsuit
demanding that they repay $1 million that Hale allegedly used to install
a Jacuzzi whirlpool in her home, pay her brother's legal expenses and
fund her husband's failed off-Broadway musical production about the life
of Martin Luther King Jr.</LD>
<LD>   "Money that should have gone to children, to care for children, went
instead for personal use," New York Atty. Gen. Eliot Spitzer said during
a Manhattan news conference. "It's despicable."</LD>
<TE>   The 72-count indictment, which includes charges of grand larceny and
forgery, was the latest revelation about financial improprieties at Hale
House--a politically well-connected fund-raising machine that over the
years had attracted support and testimonials from celebrities such as
John Lennon, Donald Trump, Rosie O'Donnell and Princess Diana.</TE>
<TE>   For years, New York mayors made a pilgrimage to Hale House on
Christmas Eve to read to the children and hand out presents. Last Dec.
24, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani again visited the children, but after
months of stories about fiscal irregularities at the fabled charity, he
spoke for many when he said then, "My reaction originally was total
disbelief." He added that "I don't want to prejudge what happened, I just
think it needs very serious investigation."</TE>
<TE>   Amid press reports that the charity spent little of the $44 million it
has raised since 1992 on a handful of children, Spitzer in May removed
Hale and her husband, Jesse Devore, from the board of directors. Both
have insisted that they are innocent. One of Hale's attorneys suggested
in a TV interview last year that she simply misunderstood the laws
governing nonprofit organizations.</TE>
<TE>   Tuesday's indictment was "as insulting as it was degrading," charged
William Dowling, Hale's current attorney, noting that the couple had been
trying to negotiate a settlement with Spitzer. "Jesse and Lorraine are
deeply distressed by the proceedings today," said Charles Clayman,
Devore's attorney. "We hope that reason will once again enter into our
dealings with the attorney general."</TE>
<TE>   Spitzer, however, said he had tried to reach an agreement with the
defendants. Noting that he moved to freeze Hale and Devore's assets, the
attorney general added: "We want to seize these things [assets] so they
can go back to Hale House.</TE>
<TE>   Hale, 75, and Devore, 69, were released on bail following the
indictment. They could face five to 15 years in prison if convicted. A
grand jury began investigating the charity's finances in November.</TE>
<TE>   The indictment says Hale and Devore stole more than $700,000 from the
Hale House Foundation and squirreled away $250,000 in a checking account
that was never made public. Hale was separately accused of cashing in a
$488,000 life insurance policy that had been taken out on her by the
charity.</TE>
<TE>   The scandal at Hale House came to light last year after a series of
revelations in the New York Daily News. Initial press reports suggested
that Lorraine Hale had illegally rented units to middle-income tenants in
two buildings owned by the charity that were intended for homeless women
and others who had been released from jail. The once-rundown structures,
which had been sold to Hale House by the city for $3, were rehabilitated
with $6 million in U.S. Housing and Urban Development funds.</TE>
<TE>   Subsequent reports suggested that Hale House's children--whose sad
faces were used for national fund-raising appeals--were rarely taken
outside of the Harlem brownstone and did not receive preschool
educations. Some were given away in illegal adoptions, according to
accounts in the New York Times.</TE>
<TE>   Hale House officials "diverted well over a million dollars, keeping
most of it and distributing the rest to family, friends, trusted
employees and ill-fated private ventures," according to a report on the
institution by Kroll Inc., an investigative firm hired by the charity's
new board of directors.</TE>
<TE>   The decline and fall of the once-revered institution would have seemed
unthinkable when Clara Hale founded it in 1969 along with her daughter.
Known as Mother Hale, she was saluted as an American hero by President
Reagan during a State of the Union speech. She was likened to an urban
saint for taking in crack-addicted babies and AIDS-infected children whom
others did not want.</TE>
<TE>   When Clara Hale died in 1992 and her daughter took over, the humble,
pioneering charity went big time, raising millions with an aggressive
public relations campaign.</TE>
<TE>   It was about as untouchable as a charity could get, and many New York
black community leaders--including the Rev. Al Sharpton and U.S. Rep.
Charles B. Rangel--initially rallied to support Hale House last year when
it came under scrutiny. On Tuesday, however, there were few such voices.</TE>
<TE>   Spitzer, who replaced Hale and Devore with new board Chairman Zachary
Carter, a former U.S. attorney, said the organization is now on the road
to recovery, adding: "We think the prospects for Hale House are superb."</TE>
<TE>   With its new leadership, Spitzer noted, "Hale House has taken a
180-degree turn."</TE>

<HD>Trial Puts Fiery Lawmaker on New Stand</HD>
<DH>Courts: Ohio Rep. Traficant represents himself as corruption case
opens. He could face 60 years in prison.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NICK ANDERSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>As his federal corruption and bribery trial opened Tuesday in
Cleveland, Rep. James A. Traficant Jr. was blasting away at what he
considers a great government conspiracy to drive him from office and
throw him behind bars.</LD>
<LD>   "I am not liked by the IRS," Traficant said in one of many nationally
televised interviews he gave shortly before the trial began. "I am not
liked by the FBI. I am not liked by the Treasury. I am not liked by the
courts. And you know what? Quite frankly, I don't give a damn."</LD>
<LD>   For all Traficant's bluster, the trial and a series of political
maneuvers are threatening to torpedo his career--and with it one of the
most durable sideshows in Congress.</LD>
<TE>   The nine-term Ohio Democrat, loathed by many in his party for
supporting Republicans on key votes, is famed for tirades in the House
against perceived government outrages. Sometimes they are punctuated with
crude language and mild profanity; usually they end with a cry gleaned
from television's "Star Trek" show: "Beam me up!"</TE>
<TE>   His tousled gray hair and well-worn plaid polyester suits are also
Traficant trademarks. Now the 60-year-old lawmaker finds himself one of
the relatively few members to be put on trial.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors allege that Traficant took gifts and favors from
constituents in exchange for lobbying aid in Washington. He also is
charged with forcing his staff to make cash kickbacks to him or to do
favors for him at his Ohio horse farm. If convicted on the 10 counts
against him, he could face more than 60 years in prison and $2 million in
fines.</TE>
<TE>   Traficant, declining legal representation, is arguing his own case
even though he is not an attorney. On Monday, as jury selection started,
he challenged U.S. District Judge Lesley Wells on points of procedure.</TE>
<TE>   At one point, Traficant sought to allow more people into the courtroom
to view "the ambience." But the judge ruled against him. "This trial is
not going to be a donnybrook," Wells told the defendant.</TE>
<TE>   Before the proceedings began, Traficant promised to try to put his
prosecutors in jail if they failed to do the same to him. But he did not
underestimate his legal adversaries.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm like a mouse looking up at an elephant, asking the elephant to
surrender, quite frankly," he told ABC's "Good Morning America."</TE>
<TE>   Traficant has had success representing himself in court.</TE>
<TE>   In 1983, he won acquittal on charges that, as a county sheriff, he
took bribes from mobsters to overlook loan-sharking, prostitution and
other illegalities.</TE>
<TE>   In his defense, Traficant admitted taking cash but said it was part of
his own sting operation.</TE>
<TE>   That legal triumph helped the former University of Pittsburgh
quarterback win election in 1984 to the House in a northeastern Ohio
district.</TE>
<TE>   In Congress, Traficant votes an idiosyncratic line that befits a
politician who is ostracized by his own party.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, he backed the reelection of Illinois Republican J. Dennis
Hastert as speaker of the House. He also voted for President Bush's tax
cut bill. But he also supports such Democratic priorities as raising the
minimum wage and expanding the rights of patients to sue managed-care
plans.</TE>
<TE>   Democrats, citing his record, shut him out of committee assignments in
early 2001. But he remains formally one of 211 Democrats in the House
minority. His response: The party "didn't have the anatomy" to toss him
out of the caucus.</TE>
<TE>   Traficant's legal problems carry obvious political perils. The last
member of Congress to be in serious legal trouble while in office, former
Rep. Jay C. Kim (R-Diamond Bar), pleaded guilty to misdemeanor charges of
accepting illegal campaign contributions in 1997 and lost in the next
primary election.</TE>
<TE>   Traficant faces a number of political challenges, even if he wins
acquittal. In a redistricting process controlled by Republicans, his 17th
Congressional District was split into two and put into districts held by
other Democrats, Reps. Ted Strickland and Thomas C. Sawyer.</TE>
<TE>   Charles Straub, spokesman for the indicted lawmaker, said Traficant
intends to run for reelection but has not decided in which district he
will compete. The filing deadline is Feb. 21.</TE>
<TE>   If he runs, analysts expect he will face strong opposition in the May
7 primary from one of the incumbents or from a state lawmaker. Democratic
officials seem especially eager to unseat him.</TE>
<TE>   "We are confident that the voters of Ohio will elect a real Democrat
who supports Democratic approaches to the issues," said Kim Rubey, press
secretary for the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee.</TE>
<TE>   But experts note that Traficant has beaten the political odds before.
If he is acquitted, he could be rejuvenated.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know how many lives Jim Traficant has. I'm never quite sure
when he's done his last one," said Washington political analyst Stuart
Rothenberg. "His skill is to portray himself as a victim and rally public
support. You never sell people like that short."</TE>
<TE>   Times researcher Robin Cochran contributed to this report.</TE>

<HD>A Boston Glee Party for the Patriots</HD>
<DH>Football: Super Bowl championship cheers a city demoralized by its
airport's role in the Sept. 11 attacks.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELIZABETH MEHREN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>BOSTON
</DL>
<LD>They came. They saw. They cheered.</LD>
<LD>   One million ebullient football fans packed the city's streets Tuesday
to celebrate the New England Patriots, the Vince Lombardi Super Bowl
Trophy and the region's first world championship team since 1986. The
spectators displayed all the fervor of religious pilgrims, grateful and
amazed that a miracle had transpired.</LD>
<LD>   "The Patriots have been bad for so long," said Steven Macomber of the
42-year-old football franchise. "And then, out of the blue, we just
shocked the world."</LD>
<TE>   Arriving as early as 6 a.m., when the sky was still black and the
temperature in single digits, many supporters said they came because
Sunday's 20-17 Super Bowl victory over the St. Louis Rams represented
more than an extraordinary performance by a team oddsmakers were quick to
dismiss.</TE>
<TE>   Boston has felt beleaguered since Sept. 11, when two planes that left
Logan International Airport plunged into New York's World Trade Center.
The city has struggled with construction and corruption associated with
the Big Dig, the decade-long effort to rebuild Boston's highway system.
The painful trial last month of one hockey father who killed another
reminded the city of how rage often is linked with children's sports. And
continuing disclosures about what Roman Catholic Church leaders here knew
about pedophile priests have shaken the faith of many in Boston.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a day to bring people together, a beautiful day, a day to let
people stop and realize all the good things we've got," said Al Smith,
riding the subway to Tuesday's parade and rally. "We needed this."</TE>
<TE>   Men and women skipped work. College students bagged exams. School kids
played hooky, knowing the consequences would be minor. Asked why they cut
classes to come to the parade, Geoff Power, 14, and his 11-year-old buddy
Billy McQueen answered as one.</TE>
<TE>   "Because the Patriots are the best!" the boys chorused.</TE>
<TE>   Forming a caravan that was as surprising as their season, the
conquering heroes arrived on 13 duck boats. The amphibious vehicles
usually used to transport tourists are native to Boston, trucks that wade
improbably in and out of water.</TE>
<TE>   Their procession inched along a two-mile route made famous by early
patriots--past the Boston Common and alongside Fanueil Hall.</TE>
<TE>   "Thank you, thank you, thank you," team owner Robert Kraft called out
over and over, brandishing the first Super Bowl trophy New England has
won.</TE>
<TE>   It was the first national trophy to visit New England since a Celtics'
basketball victory 16 years ago. In hockey, the Boston Bruins last won
the Stanley Cup in 1970. The Boston Red Sox have not won a baseball World
Series since 1918.</TE>
<TE>   On Tuesday, fans were shoe-horned into City Hall plaza, where the
cavalcade ended. Some loyalists climbed trees for better views. Others
hung from windows in the city's financial district. The crowd on the
ground was so thick that police had to ask fans not to move for fear of
causing domino-style pandemonium.</TE>
<TE>   Officers on rooftops, in helicopters, on horseback and on foot all
along the parade route helped avoid any such misfortune.</TE>
<TE>   Although the sky was blue and the sun shone brightly, the 20-degree
weather tested the fortitude of some hearty New Englanders.</TE>
<TE>   "We're numb now," said Joe Picaro, who arrived at 8:30 a.m. to secure
a spot on State Street near Fanueil Hall.</TE>
<TE>   But the cold four-hour wait to see the Patriots was worth it, said his
companion, LouAnne Meola.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm 47 years old. I've been waiting my whole life for this. I'll
never see this again," Meola said.</TE>
<TE>   "Being the Patriots, seeing what happened on 9/11," Picaro chimed in,
"a better team could not have won."</TE>
<TE>   Waving a giant American flag, Jason Marathas said the saga of the
Patriots' season carried a message for America.</TE>
<TE>   "We're representing the country here today," Marathas said, dressed
like many in full Patriots regalia. "Even though those are football
players who had a great season, they're ordinary Americans. They're just
a bunch of Americans who happen to play football."</TE>

<LD>Safety investigators found that a truck driver, who they suspect
was fatigued, triggered a collision with an Amtrak train three years ago
that killed 11 passengers and injured 122 others.</LD>
<LD>   The National Transportation Safety Board determined that John Stokes,
driving a flat-bed trailer loaded with steel, used poor judgment on March
15, 1999, when he failed to yield to warning signals and tried to cross
the tracks ahead of the train in Bourbonnais, 50 miles south of Chicago.</LD>
<LD>   The City of New Orleans, traveling at 79 mph with 228 people aboard,
struck the tail of Stokes's truck. Both locomotives and 11 of the 14 cars
derailed. Stokes suffered minor injuries.</LD>

<HD>Bush Visits Hospital to Prescribe Budget</HD>
<DH>Funding: The president argues for $5.9 billion to deal with
bioterrorism. His speech is part of an effort to build support.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAMES GERSTENZANG</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>PITTSBURGH
</DL>
<LD>With an inert anthrax spore as a prop, President Bush on Tuesday
visited a center that gathers medical data that could signal a biological
attack, continuing his effort to sell major elements of his new budget
piece by piece.</LD>
<LD>   Bush's $2.1-trillion budget proposal for fiscal 2003 includes $37.7
billion for homeland defense, up from $19.5 billion this year. Within
that is $5.9 billion to defend the nation against a biological attack--a
319% boost in such funding over the current year.</LD>
<LD>   "It's money that we've got to spend," Bush said. "We must do
everything in our power to protect our fellow Americans. We need better
testing, better vaccines and better drugs if America is going to be as
safe as it can possibly be."</LD>
<TE>   The budget also seeks $1.6 billion to improve the capacity of state
and local health-care offices to respond to biological attacks and would
devote $1.8 billion to pay for federal health-care operations after an
attack. The White House, in its budget documents, says such an attack
would "almost certainly overwhelm existing state, local and privately
owned health-care capabilities."</TE>
<TE>   Bush toured a laboratory at the University of Pittsburgh Medical
Center that was established in 1999 to track outbreaks of disease. It now
serves as a model for regional centers that would be used to detect a
bioterrorism attack.</TE>
<TE>   A similar arrangement has been established in Salt Lake City to help
officials be on alert for any signs of a biological attack during the
Winter Olympics, which begin Friday, said Gordon Johndroe, deputy press
secretary for the White House office of homeland defense.</TE>
<TE>   Bush called the system in place in Pittsburgh "a modern-day DEW line."
That was a reference to the Distant Early Warning system established
during the Cold War to warn the United States and Canada if Soviet
bombers were approaching from over the North Pole. It was a central
element of national defense in the 1950s.</TE>
<TE>   The president also visited a microbiology lab, where a medical
technician showed him a harmless anthrax spore that was positioned under
a microscope lens and displayed on a television monitor.</TE>
<TE>   The speech in Pittsburgh was one of a series Bush is making to
highlight the effect the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks and the spate of
anthrax cases in the following weeks have had on his federal spending
plan. The spread of anthrax in Florida, the Washington area and
metropolitan New York spotlighted weaknesses in preparations to counter
an onslaught of biological weapons.</TE>
<TE>   As part of his budget drive, the president visited a Coast Guard unit
last week in Maine and addressed the new demands on border security. Also
last week, he met with U.S. mayors at the White House to focus on the
needs of emergency crews and others responding to disaster. On Monday,
the day his budget was sent to Congress, he traveled to an Air Force base
in Florida to talk about the military needs that are driving a request to
increase Pentagon spending by $48 billion.</TE>
<TE>   Bush's campaign is directed at building a constituency in a
politically divided Congress. The support for national defense priorities
appears solid, but Democrats are quickly parting with the president over
some of his domestic spending cuts and his insistence that no changes be
made to the $1.35-trillion, 10-year program of tax cuts.</TE>
<TE>   The center Bush toured in Pittsburgh collects data on patients'
symptoms and other information from 17 hospitals in the Pittsburgh area
to provide warnings of the spread of infectious disease.</TE>
<TE>   Officials say the center's work illustrates the demands of fighting a
bioterrorist attack, as well as the gaps in current capabilities.</TE>
<TE>   "I want to make sure that each region around the country has the
proper equipment and the right amount of medicine for victims of any
attack, should it occur," Bush said to an audience of several hundred
medical workers.</TE>
<TE>   Under the White House plan, the increase in bioterrorism-related
funding would be used to expand state and local health systems, among
them the sort of disease surveillance systems the president was visiting.</TE>
<TE>   The money would also pay for increases in the national stockpile of
antibiotics and for research to develop vaccines and diagnostic tests,
the White House said.</TE>
<TE>   "We're preparing for the worst," Bush said.</TE>

<KH>BUSH BUDGET PLAN</KH>
<HD>Armey Assails Bush on AmeriCorps</HD>
<DH>Budget: The House majority leader says the president is 'wrong' to
offer a huge increase in the volunteer program.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JANET HOOK</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>President Bush's plan to expand federal spending to promote
volunteerism, a highlight of his new budget and last week's State of the
Union address, has come under fire from a top congressional Republican.</LD>
<LD>   House Majority Leader Dick Armey (R-Texas), speaking to reporters
Tuesday, bridled at Bush's proposal to vastly expand the budget of
AmeriCorps, a national service program created by President Clinton.</LD>
<LD>   "He's wrong on that. He is so wrong on that," said Armey, who argued
that the charitable spirit is incompatible with government subsidies and
financing. "I think the conceptual framework of AmeriCorps is obnoxious."</LD>
<TE>   Later in the day, Armey issued a statement that softened his
criticism, saying he was "encouraged" that Bush's budget also includes
plans to revamp AmeriCorps. But Armey is not alone in expressing qualms
about the program.</TE>
<TE>   Many conservative Republicans fought for years to kill the program
during the Clinton years. And their continuing opposition to it raises
the prospect that a key Bush initiative to build his legacy as a
"compassionate conservative" and to channel citizen response to the Sept.
11 terrorist attacks will run into more trouble in the GOP-controlled
House than in the Democrat-controlled Senate.</TE>
<TE>   "It will be hard for Bush to get everything he asked for on
volunteerism," said Rep. James T. Walsh (R-N.Y.), who supports the Bush
proposal. "It's a real challenge to get it accepted, but I'm willing to
try."</TE>
<TE>   The grumbling about AmeriCorps underscores another political reality
obscured by the loud Democratic complaints about the Bush budget: There
is plenty in it that Republicans don't like either.</TE>
<TE>   The spending plan proposes cutting money already appropriated for home
state projects sought by members of both parties. It would cut funding
for highways--which run through Republican districts as well as
Democratic ones. Its proposed defense increase, $48 billion, is so big
that even some Republicans are wondering if it goes too far.</TE>
<TE>   But the broadest concern expressed by conservative Republicans is that
Bush's budget drives the government back into deficit. They are pushing
for a balanced budget and looking for ways to trim spending to achieve
that goal. AmeriCorps may be one of the first places they look.</TE>
<TE>   At issue is a program established by Clinton in 1993 to promote
national service, a kind of "domestic Peace Corps." Some Republicans
complained that it includes the payment of stipends to those doing
"volunteer" work. The program's management also was criticized.</TE>
<TE>   The GOP-controlled House routinely voted to eliminate money for the
program, but it stayed alive because the funding was restored by the more
friendly Senate.</TE>
<TE>   Against that backdrop, some Republican conservatives were taken aback
when Bush said last week that he wants to build on the post-Sept. 11
sense of civic responsibility by expanding AmeriCorps, which now has
50,000 volunteers. He said he aims to recruit 200,000 new volunteers to
AmeriCorps and the Senior Corps, an existing program for retirees.</TE>
<TE>   That was the first proposal Rep. John B. Shadegg (R-Ariz.), leader of
a conservative faction of House Republicans, commented on to his staff
after listening to the State of the Union speech. "That was one of the
things he wasn't happy about," said John Pappas, Shadegg's press
secretary.</TE>
<TE>   In his speech, Bush also suggested that all Americans perform at least
4,000 hours of volunteer work over the course of their lives.</TE>
<TE>   Armey, who is retiring after this session of Congress, was asked
Tuesday how he planned to fulfill his 4,000-hour obligation. Armey
scoffed at the suggestion and joked that he would do "a few probability
seminars. . . . That's called poker."</TE>
<TE>   But he offered a critique of the AmeriCorps program in a more serious
vein: "America is a nation of great charity, and we give best when we
give what is in our own hearts. We give least well when we give at the
direction and supervision of the government. The idea that government can
teach charity to America rings very hollow with me."</TE>
<TE>   Asked if he expects Bush to have trouble winning approval of his bid
to expand AmeriCorps, Armey said: "Insofar as I can make it possible, he
will."</TE>
<TE>   Bush defended his proposal in a visit Tuesday to Pittsburgh.</TE>
<TE>   "I think the country needs to provide opportunities for people to
serve," Bush told reporters when advised of Armey's remarks. "Many in the
country are asking how they can help."</TE>

<HD>House to Debate Campaign Reform</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NICK ANDERSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>House Republican leaders, bowing in the face of a rank-and-file
rebellion, said Tuesday that they will schedule a showdown debate next
week on campaign finance reform.</LD>
<LD>   In his announcement that the issue will come to the floor Feb. 12 and
13, Speaker J. Dennis Hastert (R-Ill.) said: "I expect there will be a
vigorous debate on this issue that will reflect well on the House of
Representatives."</LD>
<LD>   The move sets in motion a frantic final week of lobbying on whether
and how to limit big-money donations. At stake are what could be the most
significant changes to the nation's political finance laws in more than
20 years.</LD>
<TE>   Proponents of strict limits, led by most House Democrats and a small
bloc of renegade Republicans, have received a major boost from recent
public scrutiny of the political influence wielded by the now-bankrupt
Enron Corp. Their goal is to ban "soft money"--the unlimited donations to
political parties. There are already limits on the amount that can be
given to individual candidates.</TE>
<TE>   The Senate approved a ban on soft money last year, voting 59 to 41 for
legislation sponsored by Sens. John McCain (R-Ariz.) and Russell D.
Feingold (D-Wis.).</TE>
<TE>   Opponents, including most congressional Republicans, say that Enron
got little or nothing for the nearly $6 million it gave to political
parties and candidates since 1989. They argue that a soft-money ban would
wreak havoc on the political system and would likely prove
unconstitutional.</TE>
<TE>   The stakes in the House are high. President Bush has signaled to House
GOP leaders that he cannot be relied on to veto a campaign finance bill
if one reaches his desk.</TE>
<TE>   Tuesday's announcement by Hastert represented a speedy acknowledgment
of a political reality thrust upon him last month.</TE>
<TE>   On Jan. 24, supporters of the main campaign finance reform bill
reached a critical mass of signatures of House members--218, a bare
majority--needed to force a vote on the issue despite the objections of
GOP leaders. Such discharge petitions, as they are known, rarely succeed
in the House, where the majority party wields enormous procedural power.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, Hastert also scheduled a campaign finance debate, but it
was canceled after Republicans and Democrats failed to agree on ground
rules.</TE>
<TE>   This time, Hastert said, the ground rules will be those supported by
the petition signers. That would mean the House can vote on a soft-money
ban and other provisions offered by Reps. Christopher Shays (R-Conn.) and
Martin T. Meehan (D-Mass.).</TE>
<TE>   Under the petition, lawmakers would also be able to vote on
alternatives from Reps. Robert W. Ney (R-Ohio) and Albert Russell Wynn
(D-Md.)--who want to limit but not ban soft money--and from House
Majority Leader Dick Armey (R-Texas).</TE>
<TE>   Greg Crist, an Armey spokesman, said he has "serious reservations"
about the Shays-Meehan bill "and will work to oppose it."</TE>

<HD>Justice Dept. Moves to Block Access to Records</HD>
<DH>Courts: The action is a response to a watchdog's lawsuit seeking
details about the controversial Cheney energy hearings.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>EDWIN CHEN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>The Bush adinistration went to court Tuesday to block an attempt by
a public-interest law firm to obtain records of Vice President Dick
Cheney's energy task force.</LD>
<LD>   In a filing required by a federal district judge here, the Justice
Department argued that Judicial Watch, a conservative watchdog group, is
not entitled to details of the task force's inner workings.</LD>
<LD>   Judicial Watch sued the administration after the White House rebuffed
its efforts to learn the number of meetings held by the task force, as
well as the dates, locations, times and subject matter of each session.
The group also is seeking any notes or minutes from those gatherings.</LD>
<TE>   In soliciting the White House response, U.S. District Judge Emmet G.
Sullivan asked the administration to explain how a "limited discovery"
during the pretrial phase of the case would violate the Constitution.</TE>
<TE>   A hearing on the case is scheduled for Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   In its reply, the Justice Department said on the Bush administration's
behalf that it is "unnecessary" for the court to weigh any constitutional
issues because Cheney's task force does not fall under the purview of the
Federal Advisory Committee Act, a law that defines the circumstances
under which meetings are subject to open-meeting laws. It requires open
meetings and records for any presidential advisory group that includes
members from outside the government.</TE>
<TE>   Although the task force met with many non-government officials,
including environmental groups and industry executives, the Justice
Department contends that the panel consisted exclusively of senior
government officials and was chaired by Cheney--and thus not subject to
the advisory committee act.</TE>
<TE>   And even if the law were applicable, the department argued, the time
allowed for discovery proceedings has passed, since the task force
disbanded Sept. 30.</TE>
<TE>   The department also said Judicial Watch's second basis for demanding
the records--under the Freedom of Information Act--does not apply since
records of the vice president are officially exempted from the act.</TE>
<TE>   But Tom Fitton, president of Judicial Watch, noted that the Justice
Department's brief did not address the constitutional question posed by
Sullivan, and he said the department's brief is "in violation of the
court's order."</TE>
<TE>   Unlike a similar lawsuit being prepared by the General Accounting
Office, the investigative arm of Congress, the Judicial Watch case does
not raise questions over the balance of power between the legislative and
executive branches of government. In resisting the GAO's attempts to
obtain task force information, the White House has said such information,
if released, would hamper the president's ability to obtain unvarnished
expert advice.</TE>
<TE>   The Enron Corp. controversy has become linked to the fight for the
task force records because the now-bankrupt company's then-chairman,
Kenneth L. Lay, a personal friend of President Bush, is the only energy
executive known to have met with Cheney during the plan's development.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to Judicial Watch's lawsuit and the GAO's impending
action, the Natural Resources Defense Council has filed a lawsuit against
the Department of Energy over the same matter. A hearing is scheduled for
Friday in federal court here.</TE>

<HD>Bullet Traced to Columbine Teen Shooter</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>DENVER
</DL>
<LD>A bullet found in the backpack of a student slain in the 1999
Columbine massacre was fired by one of the teenage gunmen, according to
test results released Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   The student's mother asked for the new testing after the parents of
another slain Columbine High School student alleged their son had been
shot by a Denver police sergeant rather than one of the gunmen.</LD>
<LD>   The Colorado Bureau of Investigation concluded the bullet lodged in a
notebook in Corey DePooter's bag came from a 9-millimeter rifle fired by
Eric Harris.</LD>
<TE>   Using the markings left on the bullet as it spun out of the gun
barrel, investigators ruled out the possibility that the bullet was fired
from the gun of fellow shooter Dylan Klebold or one of the 12 guns used
by authorities.</TE>
<TE>   DePooter, 17, was one of 13 people shot by the gunmen in the April 20,
1999, shooting. Harris and Klebold then killed themselves.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier ballistics tests had determined that two slugs found in
DePooter's chest came from Harris' rifle. The backpack bullet was not
discovered until August 1999, when DePooter's family asked for his
belongings, Jefferson County sheriff's spokesman Jim Shires said.</TE>
<TE>   In initial tests soon after the discovery, the bullet was tested
against only four law enforcement weapons because of what Shires called
an oversight.</TE>

<HD>Full Text of Statement by Mayor James K. Hahn</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Good morning. I have informed Police Commission President Rick
Caruso that I do not support Chief Parks' reappointment as chief of
police. The chief and I have real differences on major issues: police
reform, recruitment and retention, and community policing. It is because
of these differences that I cannot support his reappointment.</LD>
<LD>   To prevent a federal takeover of the LAPD, I negotiated the consent
decree with the Department of Justice because I knew then as I know now,
we cannot protect the people of Los Angeles unless we can provide
constitutional policing that ends racial profiling and tracks officers so
that bad cops are identified early and the cancer of corruption is cut
out.</LD>
<LD>   We must once and for all create a department that not only protects,
but respects every community it serves.</LD>
<TE>   The chief opposed the consent decree, and I am extremely disappointed
now that the department is falling short in its implementation of reform.</TE>
<TE>   The recruitment and retention of officers must take a high priority
within the department. We are down over 1,000 officers and we can't
protect the people of Los Angeles when we are this severely short-handed.
The chief and I have differences of opinion on how to address this
problem and its priority.</TE>
<TE>   The chief eliminated the senior lead officer program, a very popular
program with the community. It was LAPD's community policing program and
won wide support. But even after the community, the City Council and the
Police Commission and the mayor called for its reinstatement, it still
has not been fully restored, and there are many communities in Los
Angeles who do not have full access to senior lead officers.</TE>
<TE>   These are issues that I have discussed with the chief from our very
first meeting immediately after my election. However, the chief and I
continue to have major differences in these three critical areas, and a
house divided cannot move forward to implement real reform, recruit
officers and restore community policing.</TE>
<TE>   Fundamental through all of this is that the LAPD needs the support and
the commitment of the men and women in the field who risk their lives
every day to protect all of us. I do not care about the usual
disagreements between the union and management. I do care about what
officers say when they stop me on the street or when I meet them at roll
call. And over and over again I hear them ask for leadership. This
department cannot be successful unless and until the rank and file
supports a productive, community-oriented department.</TE>
<TE>   This is an extremely difficult decision for me, because my respect for
Chief Bernard Parks runs deep. I have known the chief for the past 20
years and I have worked closely with him for the past five.</TE>
<TE>   His commitment and loyalty to the department are apparent to anyone
who has ever met him. I admire and respect his 37 years of service to the
people of this city.</TE>
<TE>   However, I've concluded that it is in the best interest of this city
and the Police Department to move forward with new leadership.</TE>
<TE>   The rhetoric surrounding this decision has already reached unfortunate
levels on both sides. I am asking the Police Protective League today to
cease and desist from its campaign against the chief and get back to
policing this city. To my friends in the African American community, I
want you to know how difficult this decision was for me. But I could not
make this decision on politics and personal friendships. I had to do what
was best for the city and the department.</TE>
<TE>   This is an important issue and I expect a vigorous public debate. I
hope it's one that's constructive. I'm asking the people of this city to
allow the Police Commission to do its job under the City Charter, to
conduct a full and fair evaluation before their final determination.</TE>

<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Elton Brand looked more like a football player than a power forward
Tuesday against the New York Knicks. He had a heavy pad covering the
golf ball-sized bruise on his left hip. He also wore a protective
sleeve on his sore right elbow and another one over his right knee.</LD>
<LD>   But there was no way he wasn't going to play at Madison Square
Garden, in front of numerous friends and family who made the trip
into the city from suburban Peekskill, N.Y.</LD>
<LD>   And, certainly, he wasn't about to sit out after his Peekskill
High jersey was retired during a ceremony that included New York Gov.
George Pataki at halftime of the Red Devils' game Monday against
Beacon.</LD>
<TE>   When Brand was introduced as a starter Tuesday, the sellout crowd
greeted him with a warm ovation.</TE>
<TE>   Once the game began, it was evident that Brand was not at his
best. But he still scored 17 points and took 14 rebounds (for his
34th double-double this season and 13th in his last 15 games). He
also dived for a loose ball late in the game, landing heavily on his
right hip.</TE>
<TE>   "When you come to this building and you are a New York kid, it
doesn't matter if you are from Buffalo or Peekskill, you want to
play," Clipper Coach Alvin Gentry said. "He's a warrior. He's added
so much to our team."</TE>
<TE>   Brand admitted that his hip slowed him Tuesday. At halftime,
however, he took off the pad because it was too restrictive.</TE>
<TE>   "It felt better," said Brand, who did not play in Sunday's loss
against the Boston Celtics. "I don't like sitting out. I want to
play. If I could run, I could play.... It just felt good to win. You
always watch the Knicks growing up and you idolize the Knicks. It
feels good to beat them."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Center Michael Olowokandi had five teeth loosened or damaged when
Boston's Antoine Walker accidentally struck him while attempting a
dunk Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   Emergency repairs were made Monday in New York, but Olowokandi
will require a longer visit to the dentist when the team returns to
Los Angeles after playing Thursday against the Pistons in Detroit.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   From the It Could Happen Only in New York file: The Clippers' bus
left their midtown Manhattan hotel at 10 a.m. for the morning
shoot-around some 30 blocks away at Madison Square Garden and arrived
41 minutes later. A reporter leaving the same hotel at the same time
walked the same distance in only 36 minutes, prompting howls of
laughter from Gentry and assistant Dennis Johnson.</TE>

<LD>Once more into the breach for the Mighty Ducks, who picked themselves
off the ice with a five-game winning streak before the All-Star
break. They will now try to sustain that momentum against
Philadelphia, the best team in the Eastern Conference.</LD>
<LD>   The Ducks have not won more than five consecutive games since the
1998-99 season, when they won seven consecutive games. The club
record is nine consecutive victories, set in 1996-97. In both of
those seasons, the Ducks made the playoffs.</LD>
<LD>   "We can't think about next 20 games, we have to think about Philly
first and make sure we have two points from them," defenseman Oleg
Tverdovsky said. "We have to start the same as we left off [at the
All-Star break]."</LD>
<TE>   The Ducks are 14th in the Western Conference, 11 points out of a
playoff spot. They were 14 points out of the playoffs before the
streak began.</TE>
<TE>   "We are not in the playoff race right now, but we still have a
chance," Tverdovsky said.</TE>

<DH>Olympics: IOC subcommittee is accused of being insensitive
after refusing to allow oversized Old Glory in parade of nations.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ALAN ABRAHAMSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SALT LAKE CITY</DL>
<LD>Olympic leaders said they were trying to properly honor the victims
of the Sept. 11 terror attack when they agreed to hoist a flag
recovered from the rubble of the World Trade Center during Friday's
opening ceremony for the Salt Lake City Winter Games.</LD>
<LD>   Instead, they spent Tuesday answering charges that an Olympic
subcommittee was insensitive by turning down an earlier proposal to
carry the oversized flag into the stadium during the traditional
parade of nations because it did not follow protocol.</LD>
<LD>   Although the proposal never came before the International Olympic
Committee's Executive Board, it provided a quick lesson for the IOC
on the extraordinary sensitivities in this country--after Sept.
11--and to the potent symbolism imbued in the flag, recovered from
Ground Zero, covered in ash, and missing 12 stars.</LD>
<TE>   Salt Lake Organizing Committee President Mitt Romney was among
those displeased with the subcommittee's decision. In a statement, he
said the SLOC "supported the request by the USOC to have the U.S.
team carry the flag recovered from Ground Zero in the opening
ceremony of the 2002 Games. We respectfully disagree with the IOC."</TE>
<TE>   The controversy began over the weekend when SLOC delegates,
including Romney, appeared before the IOC's coordination subcommittee
and requested a change in the opening night ceremonies: The U.S. team
would enter in the traditional way--behind an athlete carrying a
normal-sized flag--followed by five veteran Olympic athletes and a
USOC official carrying the oversized flag.</TE>
<TE>   "We did this with typical American innocence, saying, 'Isn't this
a great idea?'" said USOC President Sandra Baldwin.</TE>
<TE>   The subcommittee, however, said that the proposal was not in line
with protocol. In addition, concerns were expressed about a
precedent--that if the U.S. flag was carried at the Salt Lake Games,
other nations might want a display of their own, commemorating
tragedies in their respective national stories, at the forthcoming
Olympics in Athens in 2004 and Beijing in 2008.</TE>
<TE>   So a compromise was struck. The oversized flag, which flew at
Yankee Stadium during last year's World Series and was featured
Sunday during the national anthem at the Super Bowl, would be raised
during the playing of "The Star-Spangled Banner" on Friday and would
serve throughout the Games as the flag of the host nation. Typically,
the host nation flag is an ordinary size.</TE>
<TE>   IOC officials were caught off guard by the controversy.</TE>
<TE>   Director General Francois Carrard said the IOC believed it had
shown "the utmost mark of respect," and added of plans to hoist the
flag, "We were proud to agree."</TE>
<TE>   Said R. Kevan Gosper of Australia, an IOC vice president, "We
generally believed that when this was discussed this was the highest
tribute we could pay."</TE>
<TE>   Instead, however, they had to answer charges that they were
insensitive--and that the IOC's policy-making Executive Board had
turned down the proposal.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, the proposal was never put to the IOC Executive Board,
Gosper said.</TE>
<TE>   "If another proposal comes forward, we will listen," he said. "No
one's hiding behind protocol here. We thought we were doing the right
thing."</TE>
<TE>   Baldwin said, "I do understand their position." But she also said,
"They also need to understand America's innocence."</TE>

<LD>Bill Spawr, who holds a three-winner edge over Bobby Frankel in the
trainers' race (14-11), will be busy today at Santa Anita.</LD>
<LD>   Spawr, the last trainer not named Bob Baffert to win the title at
the Santa Anita winter-spring meet--he led in 1995-96--has runners in
four of the first five races.</LD>
<LD>   In the opener, Yankee Pirate will be trying to end a seven-race
losing streak as he drops to the $10,000 level and stretches out
again.</LD>
<TE>   In the second, the trainer will send out recent winner Bright
Sunday and 9-5 favorite Starship Saratoga, who is the one to catch in
the mile race.</TE>
<TE>   Fairway Foe drops two levels in the third, searching for his
fourth victory in seven tries at Santa Anita. Road To Kisses, a
recent Spawr claim, is the 9-2 third choice in the fifth.</TE>
<TE>   Frankel, who has started 17 fewer horses than Spawr at the meet,
will send out first-time starter Royal Gem in the fourth and
Narasimha in the seventh.</TE>
<TE>   Race of the day: The fourth is a contentious maiden race at 61/2
furlongs on the turf. Golden Arrow, who is bred for the surface and
who is adding Lasix for his second start for trainer Neil Drysdale,
is the 3-1 morning line choice.</TE>
<TE>   Who's hot: Sharp Park. The 3-year-old Distinctive Pro colt will be
looking for his fourth consecutive victory in today's second race at
Golden Gate Fields.</TE>
<TE>   Who's not: Mikala's Starr. Later on the card at Golden Gate, this
5-year-old mare will try to end a 20-race losing streak.</TE>
<TE>   Exotically speaking:  Exacta boxes in the fourth keying Golden
Arrow with Fall For Me, Royal Gem and Hecandigit.</TE>
<TE>   Winners: Previous day/meet total: 3/90. Money: Previous day/meet
total: $14.60/$563.20. Total money bet: $512.</TE>

<HD>Flinn Review Urged</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>In an effort to get the infraction expunged from his record, the
Kings have asked the NHL to review the instigator penalty called
against rookie Ryan Flinn in the first period of Monday night's 3-1
loss to the Philadelphia Flyers.</LD>
<LD>   Flinn, a 6-foot-4, 235-pound left wing, traded punches with Todd
Fedoruk after the 6-2, 245-pound Flyer left wing checked King
defenseman Jaroslav Modry along the boards with 6:55 left in the
period.</LD>
<LD>   Flinn and Fedoruk were given five-minute fighting majors, with
Flinn also getting hit with the instigator penalty, his first, and a
10-minute misconduct.</LD>
<TE>   Three instigator penalties bring an automatic two-game suspension.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a mutual thing," King Coach Andy Murray said of Monday's
fight, Flinn's fourth in five NHL games. "Their guy was ready. Flinn
didn't skate a long way to go after him. He didn't go out of position
to get involved."</TE>
<TE>   Flinn, though, has not been shy about dropping his gloves.</TE>
<TE>   Signed by the Kings last month and called up from the minors Jan.
21, he has spent more than twice as much time in the penalty box as
on the ice, accumulating 36 minutes in penalties while playing 14
minutes 43 seconds.</TE>
<TE>   "He's playing that role the way it's supposed to be played,"
Murray said of the 21-year-old from Halifax, Canada. "That he would
be this successful this early in his career, it's a pleasant
surprise."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Though their 11-11-3-1 record at Staples Center is the worst home
record among the 16 teams currently in playoff positions, the Kings
don't seem concerned about it.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not really that we're struggling at home," captain Mattias
Norstrom said. " ... We're .500 at home. Sure, we want to be better.
We're aware of the situation, but I don't think there's a panic about
it."</TE>
<TE>   The Kings play 15 of their last 28 games at Staples Center. Their
14-9-4-1 record on the road is the best in the Western Conference.</TE>

<HD>Bulls in Town, but They Might Not See O'Neal</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Tim Brown</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It seems a fair bet that Shaquille O'Neal will not play tonight, when
the Lakers play the last-place Chicago Bulls for the first time since
O'Neal took a swipe at Brad Miller and then paid three games and more
than $700,000 for the pleasure.</LD>
<LD>   The Lakers have left the decision to O'Neal, whose arthritic big
toe has been his limp and their headache for several months, long
enough for O'Neal to seek medical advice from outside the
organization.</LD>
<LD>   "We're leaning toward not playing him," Laker Coach Phil Jackson
said Tuesday morning. "There's no doubt about it. [But] if Shaq said,
'I want to play and that's all there is to it,' we'd be more than
willing to be compliant."</LD>
<TE>   If it means anything, Miller expects O'Neal to play, then to abuse
O'Neal with his blurry first step.</TE>
<TE>   "He's big and can push me around," Miller said Tuesday, "but he
can't guard me, because I can step outside and use my quickness on
him."</TE>
<TE>   The prevailing opinion among the Lakers is that O'Neal will rest
for at least eight days and continue on a course devised recently by
Dr. Robert Mohr, chief of podiatric surgery at UCLA Medical Center.</TE>
<TE>   O'Neal has played a few games with new inserts in his shoes, and a
newer set of orthotics is expected any day. Mohr said he has
contacted Starter, the company that makes O'Neal's shoes, regarding
slight alterations he believes would also relieve the pain in the
first joint of O'Neal's toe, and the company has been agreeable.</TE>
<TE>   O'Neal could eventually undergo postseason surgery, Mohr said, but
in the meantime he would concentrate on taking the stress off the
affected joint.</TE>
<TE>   "There's a whole sequence of events, depending on the severity of
the condition," Mohr said. "His is significant. The guy is in
significant discomfort. This is not a little nagging injury. Plus, in
his chosen sport, he jams on this thing constantly. And, living on
pain medication is not a solution."</TE>
<TE>   Asked if O'Neal could expect to have the pain diminish by, say,
the start of the playoffs, Mohr said, "I'm very confident we can do a
lot to help him through this part of the season."</TE>
<TE>   O'Neal played eight games in 13 days after returning from the
three-game suspension for almost hitting Miller, and dragged his big
toe through most of them. He was, however, named the Western
Conference player of the week for the period ending Sunday, at the
height of his distress. He said Tuesday that he hadn't decided if he
would play.</TE>
<TE>   "Not yet," he said as he waded through reporters before practice.</TE>
<TE>   He has not seemed particularly determined to play against the
Bulls, a terrible team that nevertheless provides him two forms of
motivation: The Bulls beat the Lakers in overtime in that Jan. 12
game, and Miller can't seem to accept his good fortune and walk away.</TE>
<TE>   Miller has a sore hand, but said he would play and expected O'Neal
to, as well.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not going to chicken out," he said. "If I weighed 350, I
wouldn't be missing the game. He's going to play. I'm sure he's just
blowing this all up."</TE>
<TE>   Charles Oakley, who battered O'Neal as Miller did, has a sore
wrist and might not play. He sat out the Bulls' past two games.
Without Oakley, a "has-been" in O'Neal's estimation, or O'Neal, the
game might simply turn on the basketball, which is what most
predicted on its eve.</TE>
<TE>   "I think Brad Miller saw the punch Shaq tried to throw at him,"
Kobe Bryant said. "I don't think he'll put himself in that
predicament again. What happened, happened. We have to be
professionals."</TE>
<TE>   Jackson called it "part of basketball."</TE>
<TE>   "When you go out and play you have to be prepared to play through
fouls and play in a rough game or a hard game," he said. "One thing
about Chicago, they may not be extremely talented, but they play very
hard. They're going to play hard."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Five days after later sitting out the Laker game, Horace Grant
returned to the Orlando Magic, explaining that he missed the time
because of food poisoning, not an intestinal virus.</TE>
<TE>   Magic Coach Doc Rivers had wondered why Grant didn't try to play
against the Lakers, and Laker players suggested Grant had contracted
"Shaq-arrhea." There was speculation that Grant was furious. Not so,
said Grant, a very popular Laker teammate last season.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't take it personally," he said. "I laughed about it. I
think it was Shaq who didn't want to play me, so he contaminated the
takeout food that caused the problem."</TE>
<TE>   In case anyone missed the suggestion that Jackson really didn't
want to go to the All-Star game in Philadelphia this weekend, he
dropped this before Tuesday's practice.</TE>
<TE>   "I was really looking forward to Jam Time on Saturday afternoon,"
he said. "That's one of my favorite times. I like to get down and rap
with the kids. That's terrific stuff."</TE>
<TE>   Jackson is not a great admirer of rap music.</TE>

<HD>Nowitzki Excels in Overtime Work</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Dirk Nowitzki did the one thing the Indiana Pacers could not do: make
free throws in the closing seconds of an overtime.</LD>
<LD>   Nowitzki scored 38 points, had 17 rebounds and made the
game-winning free throws with 3.6 seconds left, and the Dallas
Mavericks defeated the Pacers, 141-140, in two overtimes Tuesday
night at Indianapolis.</LD>
<LD>   Michael Finley scored 31 points and had 14 rebounds, Steve Nash
had 25 points and 10 assists and Tim Hardaway had 21 points for the
Mavericks, who reached a season-high point total.</LD>
<TE>   Jamaal Tinsley missed two free throws for Indiana with 5.4 seconds
left in the first overtime and the score tied, 131-131. Jeff Foster
grabbed the rebound off the second miss and was fouled but also
missed twice.</TE>
<TE>   "Chances are, somebody's going to get a break when you miss your
free throws," Dallas Coach Don Nelson said. "That's the only reason
we won the game."</TE>
<TE>   With 1:56 left in the second overtime, Reggie Miller, who scored
23 points, put the Pacers ahead, 136-134, and Austin Croshere
followed with a dunk on the next possession to make it 138-134.</TE>
<TE>   Croshere, who hadn't scored more than 14 points this season and
had fallen out of Coach Isiah Thomas' rotation, tied a career-high
with 32 points and had 12 rebounds. Jalen Rose led the Pacers with 33
points and Tinsley had 18 points and 19 assists.</TE>
<TE>   Hardaway made a three-point basket and Nowitzki made two free
throws to cut the deficit to 140-139 with 9.2 seconds left.</TE>
<TE>   Jonathan Bender missed two free throws with 8.4 seconds left,
setting up Nowitzki's free throws.</TE>
<TE>   Washington 99, Toronto 94--Michael Jordan scored 20 of his 23
points in the second half at Washington and the Wizards won their
fourth in a row and for the sixth time in seven games.</TE>
<TE>   Vince Carter scored 29 points for Toronto but only four in the
fourth quarter, negating a good defensive effort in which he fought
through screens to frustrate Jordan for much of the game.</TE>
<TE>   Boston 82, Charlotte 79--Paul Pierce scored 24 points and Antoine
Walker had 19 for the Celtics at Charlotte, N.C.</TE>
<TE>   Baron Davis scored 28 points for the Hornets.</TE>
<TE>   Detroit 86, Philadelphia 82--Jerry Stackhouse scored 29 points at
Auburn Hills, Mich., and the Pistons capitalized on Allen Iverson
missing his final 11 shots.</TE>
<TE>   Iverson scored 26 points on seven-for-31 shooting. Philadelphia
had won 10 of 13 and six in a row against the Pistons, who have won
six of their last seven.</TE>
<TE>   Orlando 106, Cleveland 98--Tracy McGrady had 29 points, eight
rebounds and six assists and reserve Troy Hudson scored 16 of his 22
points in the second half for the Magic at Orlando, Fla.</TE>
<TE>   Wesley Person scored 21 points for the Cavaliers, who have lost 15
of their last 16.</TE>
<TE>   Atlanta 76, Miami 73--Shareef Abdul-Rahim had 34 points and 11
rebounds at Miami, and the Hawks ended the Heat's three-game winning
streak.</TE>
<TE>   Rod Strickland and Eddie Jones each scored 16 points for Miami,
which lost for only the third time in its last 13.</TE>
<TE>   Denver 97, Portland 96--Ryan Bowen made a layup and a free throw
with 13 seconds left, lifting the Nuggets at Denver.</TE>
<TE>   Raef LaFrentz had 25 points for the Nuggets, who ended a
three-game losing streak. Nick Van Exel had 20 points and 16 assists.
Ruben Patterson had 31 points for Portland.</TE>
<TE>   Memphis 86, Utah 79--Rodney Buford scored 20 points and Pau Gasol
had 19 points and 13 rebounds at Memphis, Tenn., helping the
Grizzlies stop a three-game skid.</TE>
<TE>   Seattle 113, Golden State 87--Rashard Lewis scored 25 points and
Gary Payton had 20 points and nine assists for the SuperSonics at
Oakland.</TE>
<TE>   The SuperSonics ended a three-game losing streak by beating the
Warriors for the 11th consecutive time.</TE>

<LD>   Standing 10 feet from the goal, Isbister tipped Mariusz
Czerkawski's pass from the left boards past Brent Johnson at 10:21.</LD>
<LD>   Garth Snow earned the victory, the 98th of his career, with 17

<LD>Los Angeles Price will forfeit its final two regular-season boys'
basketball games to avoid exceeding the Southern Section's 20-contest
limit, Coach Michael Lynch said. The Knights, who will finish the
regular season with records of 22-6 overall and 6-2 in the Harbor
League, planned to forfeit Tuesday's game against L.A. Ribet Academy
and Friday's game against Rolling Hills Prep. Price's schedule
included three tournaments, which count as two games apiece, as well

<LD>Ventura St. Bonaventure High running back Lorenzo Booker and La Palma
Kennedy two-way standout Rhema McKnight will announce their college
choices at news conferences today, the first day high school football
players can sign letters of intent.</LD>
<LD>   The two, along with running back Hershel Dennis and offensive
lineman Winston Justice, both of Long Beach Poly, are the top
Southland recruits who haven't announced commitments. Booker, who
will make his announcement at 3:45 p.m. today televised live on ESPN
from the Casa Sirena Hotel in Oxnard, was expected to sign with USC,
but sources close to USC and Booker said he was still considering
other schools. McKnight, who has played receiver, quarterback,
running back and defensive back, is holding a news conference at 3
p.m. at Kennedy.</LD>
<TE>   Other late commitments include: linebacker Dana Garrison and
receiver Jovan Hutchinson of Fairfax to Colorado State and Boise
State, respectively; defensive back Doug Middleton of Anaheim Servite
to Pennsylvania; receiver and defensive back Travonne Jackson of Los
Angeles Jefferson to Brigham Young; and West Covina South Hills
kicker Adrian Rosales to Portland State, offensive lineman Adam
Messick and wide receiver Jaron Fairman to Fresno State, and
linebacker Tyrell Tyler and running back Marcus Nolan to San Jose
State. Denny Flanagan of Huntington Beach Edison will not attend San
Diego State, which didn't have a scholarship for him. He'll choose
between Nevada and Montana State.</TE>

<LD>Hugo Cepeda, an assistant boys' soccer coach at Cathedral High, will
return to the sidelines today after serving a two-game suspension for
throwing an object at a Salesian player during a match on Jan. 25.</LD>
<LD>   Salesian coaches contend that Cepeda, a volunteer assistant, threw
a wadded-up piece of athletic tape that hit the back of the head of a
Salesian player who had just conducted a throw-in along the Cathedral
sideline. Cathedral Coach Arturo Lopez said Cepeda "flicked a [water]
bottle cap" at the Salesian player.</LD>
<LD>   The player had uttered a profanity after it appeared that Cepeda
intentionally kicked the ball away from him as he retrieved it for a
throw-in. Cepeda was issued a red card. Cathedral won, 3-1.</LD>

<LD>The attorney representing former San Bernardino High boys' basketball
Coach Jesse Spinner, who faces one count of felony embezzlement for
allegedly pocketing money that was supposed to go to the San
Bernardino City Unified School District, said the money was
specifically earmarked for his client by two private basketball
organizations.</LD>
<LD>   Attorney Dan Greenberg said Spinner received three checks totaling
$1,303.75 from the American Roundball Corp. and National Junior
Basketball for coordinating and supervising basketball games at the
San Bernardino gym. Spinner, who posted $25,000 bail after being
arrested at his home last week, faces up to three years in state
prison if convicted. He has been placed on administrative leave as a
special education teacher at San Bernardino.</LD>

<LD>Sparked by the return of center D'Angelo Collins, Inglewood High,
ranked No. 20 by The Times, dealt No. 19 Redondo Union its first Bay
League loss, 67-55, in a boys' basketball game Tuesday night at
Inglewood.</LD>
<LD>   Collins, a 6-foot-10 senior, had missed the last 14 games with a
knee injury. He played 23 minutes Tuesday and finished with 11
points, 10 rebounds and three blocks. He had a dunk at the final
buzzer.</LD>
<LD>   "My knee cap came off track ... and this was the first time I felt
OK to test it out," said Collins, who is considering entering the NBA
draft this summer. "I want to get my timing back before the
playoffs."</LD>
<TE>   Jason McKinney scored 26 points and Chris Holloway had 12 for
Inglewood (20-5, 10-3 in league), which defeated Redondo, 62-59, in a
tournament in December with Collins in the lineup, but lost to the
Sea Hawks, 65-41, Jan. 15 with Collins out.</TE>
<TE>   Adam Zahn scored 15 points and Keith Ellison had 12 for Redondo
Union (18-6, 12-1).</TE>

<HD>A Field of Eight Is Vying for 2010 Winter Games</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ALAN ABRAHAMSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SALT LAKE CITY</DL>
<LD>Eight cities are in the running for the 2010 Winter Games, the
International Olympic Committee announced Tuesday, among them
Vancouver, Canada, perhaps the strongest contender in the field and
one that--if selected--would likely doom the chances of the United
States playing host to the Summer Games in 2012.</LD>
<LD>   Besides Vancouver, the cities are: Andorra La Vella, Andorra;
Bern, Switzerland; Harbin, China; Jaca, Spain; Pyeongchang, South
Korea; Salzburg, Austria; and Sarajevo, Bosnia-Herzegovina, which
played host to the 1984 Winter Games.</LD>
<LD>   The IOC's policy-making Executive Board will trim the list at a
meeting Aug. 28-29. It's up to the IOC to determine how many will
then remain as formal "candidate" cities; the eight are now known as
"applicant" cities. The IOC will select the site of the 2010 Games on
July 2, 2003, at a general assembly in Prague, capital of the Czech
Republic.</LD>
<TE>   Vancouver offers the advantages of a bigger city, which--as in the
choice of Salt Lake and the site of the 2006 Winter Games, Turin,
Italy--the IOC now prefers. It has turned away from village-oriented
Winter Games, as in 1994 in Lillehammer, Norway.</TE>
<TE>   Vancouver's other decided advantage is the alpine facilities at
nearby Whistler.</TE>
<TE>   Other contenders, according to a number of IOC members who
declined to be interviewed on the record, appear initially to be
Salzburg and Bern.</TE>
<TE>   In 2005, meantime, the IOC will pick the site of the 2012 Summer
Games. U.S. cities New York, San Francisco, Washington and Houston
are vying for those Games.</TE>
<TE>   The Olympics were held in Australia in 2000 and will be held in
Europe in 2004 (Athens), in Europe again in 2006 (Turin) and then in
Asia in 2008 (Beijing). They were held in Asia in 1998 (Nagano,
Japan). The United States will have held them four times in recent
years--Lake Placid (1980), Los Angeles (1984), Atlanta (1996) and
Salt Lake City (2002).</TE>
<TE>   Canada, however, has not staged the Games since 1988 (in Calgary).
Toronto bid for the 2008 Summer Olympics but finished as runner-up to
Beijing.</TE>
<TE>   Canada, of course, offers the same time-zone advantages that U.S.
broadcasters--the Olympic movement's primary financial
underwriter--find so attractive.</TE>
<TE>   Awarding the Games to Vancouver would tie in with a recent IOC
tradition of rewarding second tries; Athens, for instance, won the
2004 Games after losing out on  the 1996 Olympics. Perhaps more
important, Canada in 2010 would ease the way for the many members
interested in bringing the Summer Games, the IOC's historical
showcase, back to Europe in 2012.</TE>
<TE>   Officials in Madrid, Rome, Moscow, Paris, London, Rio de Janeiro
and Havana have announced preliminary interest in staging the 2012
Games. Europeans account for about half the IOC membership and,
though financing comes largely from U.S.-based corporations, European
interests often drive the IOC's agenda.</TE>

<HD>IOC Executive Board Won't Be Quite as Detailed With Minutes</HD>
<DH></DH>

<DL>SALT LAKE CITY</DL>
<LD>The International Olympic Committee announced Tuesday that it will
immediately adopt a new system of taking and distributing the
confidential minutes from its policy-making Executive Board meetings.</LD>
<LD>   Speaking at the IOC's general assembly, President Jacques Rogge
said the new system would provide members and others with a more
"synthetic" record of the proceedings, one that simply summarizes
discussions that were held and decisions taken.</LD>
<LD>   The current minutes provide a thorough summary of what was said,
who said it and what decisions, if any, were made.</LD>
<TE>   Under the new protocol, a verbatim record of the proceedings will
be kept in Olympic archives in Lausanne, Switzerland, IOC Director
General Francois Carrard said. By contrast, the general assemblies,
called IOC "sessions," have been televised since 1999 on
closed-circuit television and can be viewed by the public and press.</TE>
<TE>   Carrard said the change to a far-less revealing system of minutes
had been under study for weeks. The new system, he said, is "like
many boards have."</TE>

<LD>Short track speedskater Rusty Smith of Sunset Beach said he and
teammate Ron Biondo cleared the air about allegations made by Tommy
O'Hare and initially supported by Biondo that Smith and Apolo Anton
Ohno colluded to fix a race at the U.S. Olympic trials in December.</LD>
<LD>   "I have no problem. It's over. We have a written statement saying
it's over," said Smith, who was cleared of any wrongdoing by an
arbitrator after O'Hare filed a complaint. O'Hare's complaint was
found to have no merit and was withdrawn.</LD>
<LD>   "Our whole team has come back together really quickly. It would be
great to have everybody on the team be best friends, but welcome to
the real world. We're not best friends, but we're teammates and we're
there for each other.... Everybody's back on track and ready to go.
We're more focused than we would have been if we hadn't had this
happen."</LD>
<TE>   Smith acknowledged missing nearly a week's training while
defending himself from the allegation, but he's not worried. "It's
nice now to have everything out of the way and focus on what we're
here to do," he said.</TE>

<TE>   Long track speedskater Jennifer Rodriguez expects history to be
made early and often at the Olympic Oval, where competition begins
Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   "I think the track is definitely the fastest in the world," she
said. "I know the times everybody's skating, they're breaking
American or country records.</TE>
<TE>   "Records are going to fall like flies here at these Games."</TE>
<TE>   Five world records were set at the Oval at the world single
distance championships last March and during World Cup races in
December.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The speedskaters will be wearing new skinsuits made for them by
Nike. The suits are designed to cut down on wind resistance and are
cut to be most comfortable in a bent-over skating posture, creating a
need for extensive custom fitting.</TE>
<TE>   "I believe we're the only short track country wearing them," Smith
said. "As soon as we step on the track, everybody's looking at us."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Alpine skier Casey Puckett, who will be competing in his fourth
Olympics, said he has noticed the high level of security at all the
venues.</TE>
<TE>   "We just went through seven checkpoints to get here," he said
during a news conference at the main press center. "They had mirrors
over the car and under the car. It's going to be difficult to get
around. I guess we're going to have to go through that to get to
Snowbasin every morning. That means we're going to have to get up
earlier."</TE>
